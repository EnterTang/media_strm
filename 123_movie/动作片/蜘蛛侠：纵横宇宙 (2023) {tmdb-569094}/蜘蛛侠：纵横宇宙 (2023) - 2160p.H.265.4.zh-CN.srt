1
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,010
Let's do it differently this time

2
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,030
Very different

3
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,940
His name is Miles Morales

4
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,330
A radioactive spider bit him

5
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,870
And he wasn't the only one bitten.

6
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,520
Problems are not always easy for him.

7
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,940
And he is not alone in this problem.

8
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,250
Now it has to finish itself.

9
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,850
And once again he is not alone.

10
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,060
You think you know the rest of the story.

11
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,520
But you don't know.

12
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,640
I thought I knew the rest, but...

13
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,570
...I do not know.

14
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,490
I don't want to hurt her.

15
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,170
But I do.

16
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,590
And he's not the only one I've hurt

17
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,070
Hey

18
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,630
Def Leppard (rock band)

19
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:38,920
Gwen

20
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,250
Chelsea, New York Ground-65

21
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,480
Spider Gwen World

22
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,360
Is the song over?

23
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,800
Apparently they have.

24
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,350
Ok my friend if you don't follow us and want to talk.

25
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,670
I don't join groups to talk about my feelings.

26
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,340
That's why I joined…

27
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,650
... to beat my feelings with this stick.

28
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,480
If you don't talk about your problems, possibly from somewhere...

29
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,350
I'm fine.

30
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,610
A sane person would not respond like that.

31
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,650
They say I'm great, thanks, how are you?

32
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,870
I'm fine thanks.

33
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,260
Wow   -How are you?

34
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,620
Really?  Gwen, don't worry.

35
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,680
I don't understand you.   -You are right.

36
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,280
I sing to the drums.

37
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,220
I always wanted to be in a band.

38
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,690
I don't think I've found the right one yet.

39
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:27,670
In this job, you always know it's best to go it alone.

40
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,580
Before Miles.

41
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,530
It's Peter.

42
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,050
I think it's great, I don't know.

43
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,590
This is a dangerous masked man

44
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,480
I don't know, he seems like a nice guy.

45
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,230
If he has nothing to hide, why is he wearing a mask?

46
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,410
Okay, let's stop politicizing this matter.

47
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,000
Thank you, Meg

48
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,830
But they really don't know me.

49
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,190
And I really don't know him that well.

50
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,630
If you touch it again, man

51
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,790
Gwen, it's okay.

52
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,900
Until it's too late.

53
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,630
Hi Gwen.   -Hi

54
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,040
Peter.

55
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,590
What the.

56
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,880
Not.

57
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,990
No no no.

58
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,520
What are you doing?

59
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,200
I just want to be special.

60
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,560
Like you, Gwen.

61
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,540
Gwen?   -Do not worry

62
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,490
Who is Gwen?

63
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,000
Everything went well.

64
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,510
Everything is going well.   -no... don't leave.

65
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,430
Peter.

66
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,770
hey hey hey

67
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,270
Peter?

68
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,310
After that incident, I really didn't find any other friends.

69
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,900
Except for one.

70
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,170
But he is not here.

71
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,790
And there's no way you're going there.

72
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,620
I have to announce that Captain George Stacey is leading the team after Spider-Woman.

73
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,610
who is this

74
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,110
And why doesn't he show his face?

75
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,790
Peter Parker, an innocent student.

76
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,770
Peter Parker, often at my table, at meals.

77
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,920
He is my daughter's boyfriend.

78
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:53,420
I won't rest even until I find Spiderwoman.

79
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,170
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

80
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,420
how is the band

81
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,030
Yeah, that's great, I give up.

82
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,580
So dad knows, it's okay.

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,790
In the case of Spiderwoman, I accomplished something.

84
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,990
Okay, that's great.   -I approached him.

85
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,010
Let me say I feel it.

86
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,300
And I.

87
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,110
Catching him is good for us.   -Don't be so sure.

88
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,220
He killed your friend.

89
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,860
I do not understand.   -What do you want to say?

90
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,490
I know what happened, I was there.

91
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,350
... fled the scene.

92
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,730
Maybe he had no other choice.

93
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:44,670
I have to do my job, Gwen.   -He won't bring her back.

94
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,710
I also lost someone you love.

95
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,250
Good?

96
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,140
Yes, dad can say that.

97
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:03,870
I just wanted to say...didn't you hug your dad?

98
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,230
We have the ability to have a superman for all units.

99
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,000
...a suspect in the museum.   -Maybe this is him.

100
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,330
Some kind of eagle   -See you later

101
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:28,700
Does not matter.

102
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,420
I will call you.

103
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,990
The situation is very bad here.

104
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,350
We need help.

105
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,010
Captain Stacey spoke, I'm five minutes away.

106
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,380
I need you to pay attention.

107
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,850
Chances are a girl will be found.

108
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,210
Tonight, it looks like we're going to catch Spiderman.

109
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,300
Oh that's good.

110
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,380
Please sir.

111
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,580
Explain how a person with a 12 meter wingspan could enter the Guggenheim without being noticed?

112
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,770
The Ugliness of New Yorkers Everyone has a story.

113
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,400
Do you know what he wants?

114
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,700
do you know Italian

115
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,920
I am Irish.

116
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,680
Maybe he likes pasta.

117
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,430
We all enter at my command.

118
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,370
Watch out for signs of Spiderwoman.

119
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,580
Hi

120
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,010
I found her.

121
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,450
Stop following me?

122
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,920
Okay shut up.

123
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,230
Eagles!

124
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,010
Calling their name usually works.

125
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,510
I think it worked.

126
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,650
I'm not an Eagle.

127
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,680
The pinnacle of human genius.

128
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,640
You're not an Eagle in my world, who are you?  Are you made of parchment paper?

129
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,370
What world did you bring me to?

130
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,730
Bully, I was like that.

131
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,950
Where are you from, my friend?

132
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,460
I am an artist, I will finish my work here.

133
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,880
Oh, that's great, you're from the Renaissance.

134
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,910
Yes.    -Let me guess.

135
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,460
You drink espresso the old fashioned way from Da Vinci's era.

136
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,490
A portal opens and you are thrown here.

137
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,660
I'm right?

138
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,550
Yes.  Only this

139
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:46,200
Do you think that maybe there is no need to destroy art museums like Alki?

140
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,770
This is not art at all.

141
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,500
That's what we're talking about, right?

142
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,900
Oh, that's cool.

143
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,590
That is, this is what we call the art of metaphorical interpretation.

144
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,540
But it's still art.

145
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,350
Oh no, cousin.

146
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,670
I don't play with fire, my friend

147
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,200
You are made of paper

148
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,280
Goodbye, little girl

149
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,600
Oh no.

150
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,040
Excuse me, who are you?

151
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,360
This is a secret.

152
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,490
Are you a blue leopard?   -Not

153
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,810
Cider with a blue cap?   -Not!

154
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,990
Dark Garfield?  Freeman?   -You have to finish it.

155
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,280
I'm from another dimension.

156
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,520
Really?

157
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,180
Actually, I'm not confused at all.

158
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,420
My name is Miguel O'Hara (Spiderman 2099)

159
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,030
I lead an elite task force committed to protecting the Multiverse.

160
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:07,900
Actually, it's not a problem at all.

161
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,700
Can you go anywhere with that bracelet?

162
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,470
It's sadder than a bracelet.

163
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,750
Okay, how sensitive are you now?

164
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,490
Look, it's a Renaissance flying turkey.

165
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,830
Gotta do justice... so we're good.

166
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,100
No problem, son.

167
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:21,960
From now on I take over.

168
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,250
Good

169
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,260
So stay away.

170
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,490
Why do you say that?

171
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,770
You're not funny at all.

172
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,280
I do not know.

173
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,000
I must say that the work you have brought is very hard.

174
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,180
What nonsense?   -Interworld Kingpin device

175
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,020
What do you say?

176
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,140
What about you, Ghar Ghor   -Shut up.

177
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,490
We save the multiverse.

178
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:48,020
You opened a portal for people like this to accidentally walk into another dimension.

179
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:54,140
And now let me return them all to their rightful place before time and space are broken.

180
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:59,250
Don't let me tell you the story of Doctor Strange and the schoolchildren of world 199999(MCU world, number 199999)

181
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,380
Who is Doctor Strange?

182
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,220
Maybe it's better not to do drugs.

183
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,700
Captain, stay here, I'll be right back.

184
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:11,190
Do you want me to do this right?

185
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,920
Oh, good

186
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,950
It has Hammerspace.

187
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,540
Hammerspace: This is a timeless, interdimensional storage space where cartoon characters pick things out of thin air and make them appear.

188
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,390
layla can you do it  you know that.

189
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,150
No, you have to say it.

190
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,690
Call for help.

191
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,330
I can not hear.   -Call for help.

192
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,580
... please call.

193
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:45,630
Okay, I'm calling.

194
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,460
But I like what you have to say.

195
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,560
spider woman

196
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,750
And I.

197
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,310
You are...?

198
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,140
Oh, this?

199
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:20,620
I don't know if it's a boy or a girl, it will be a surprise for my husband.

200
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,040
He thinks mature.

201
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,790
But it is very good.

202
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,060
Are you going to adopt me?   -What the?

203
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:30,280
Can you guys focus on this threat across time and space?

204
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,410
How is the girl?   -Not!

205
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,860
We can get some help from him.   -Not.

206
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,230
Because he called you Dark Garfield?   -Not.

207
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,470
Can you say anything but no?   -No, no.

208
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,640
Why did you say no?   -You know why.

209
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,120
Well, that's enough

210
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:03,390
Feel this Bomb.

211
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,910
Don't let him run away.

212
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,990
You ruined everything.

213
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,670
I thought something was wrong.

214
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:31,300
Surrender that you are under siege. "Get out of here right now."

215
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,740
I am a good person.

216
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,370
It seems you are not a good person.

217
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,640
Just shut your mouth and... no.

218
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,430
Help!   -Need help.

219
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,810
Yeah, I think it's Bansky.

220
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,790
That's what I thought too.

221
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,220
Raise your hand!

222
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,380
Captain, come on.

223
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
Armed suspect.

224
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,880
What weapon?  I do not have.

225
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,090
get down!

226
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,710
Which?  Should I raise my hand or lie down?

227
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,730
You are under arrest.

228
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,000
I just saved a lot of people.

229
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,250
For killing Peter Parker.

230
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,280
Don't worry captain.

231
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,670
You have the right to remain silent.   -You do not understand.

232
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,990
You do not understand.

233
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,030
Father.

234
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,270
I want to tell dad.

235
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,330
But you know why I don't want to say that.

236
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,800
I understand why.

237
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,200
I didn't kill Peter.

238
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,250
He didn't like it... I didn't know it was Peter.

239
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
I have no choice.

240
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,150
How long have you been lying to me?

241
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:41,700
Can't you be a cop for a while and be my dad and listen to me?

242
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,060
Do you really think I'm a murderer?

243
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,240
Dad did this to help people, right?

244
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,770
It's not like that?

245
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,810
And I.

246
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,950
And now the way to help is to listen to me.

247
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,260
Please, father.

248
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,180
Father is the only thing I have.

249
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,940
You have the right to remain silent.

250
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,460
All your words will be in court.

251
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,370
Father, are you afraid of me?

252
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,550
You have the right to call a lawyer.

253
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,480
Without stopping.

254
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,520
Don't come near!

255
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,840
Father.

256
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,700
Calm.

257
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,840
We've got you covered.

258
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,010
Isn't that right, Miguel?

259
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,900
Layla, scan this vandalism.

260
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,620
There are no more discrepancies to be seen.

261
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,880
The main place is safe.

262
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,180
We can't just leave it.

263
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,110
He faced it alone.

264
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,150
I don't know how to fix the situation.

265
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,840
Yes.

266
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:13,050
Okay, join the team.

267
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,030
Brooklyn Earth-1610

268
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,300
I know Miles is still in second grade.

269
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,970
But we wanted to talk about his college interview...so.

270
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,990
I'm sure it can be found at any time.

271
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,690
He doesn't joke with anyone about his future

272
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,140
Excuse me, do you have an ATM?

273
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,240
Yes, there.

274
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,800
Better not be tied to the wall   -What?

275
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,230
It's ok.

276
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,000
It should be pretty simple.

277
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,490
Just drill a hole and take the money.

278
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,210
Not that one.

279
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,070
should.

280
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,350
Take the money and leave the car.

281
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,030
where is your money honey

282
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,220
hey man what are you doing there

283
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,790
No, it's not good at all.

284
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:29,290
I forgot my password.   -Go away.

285
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,230
Let me steal from you.

286
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,640
I will beat you.

287
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,510
No need.

288
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,300
I never stole.

289
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,930
Don't give me a bad robbery experience.   -bad robbery?

290
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,250
This store is my life.

291
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,770
I have a problem, you also have fairy powder.

292
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,580
See, I was a scientist, I still am.

293
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,140
By the way, have you ever heard of the company name Alchemex?

294
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,870
I worked there.

295
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,850
Then something happened.

296
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,660
I had a little accident.

297
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,980
Now I...

298
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,170
...I apologize.

299
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,400
First of all, I'm not stealing from you.

300
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,890
I mean, this ATM isn't yours, is it?

301
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,420
It's a bank, they're the criminals.

302
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,160
You are a criminal who stole from me.

303
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,900
You know, with this look, it wouldn't work anywhere else.  So I have to do it.

304
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,020
I don't want to work.   -Why bring an ATM?

305
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:13,900
Who is?

306
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,880
Why carry an ATM.

307
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,100
Spiders!

308
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,370
Hey Lenny, how much is this steak?

309
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:26,400
Spidey, if you catch him, it's free.

310
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,750
Oh, Spider-Man.  This is true.

311
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,880
So are you a cow or a spotted dog?

312
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:38,120
I am... (Stain)

313
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,450
We meet again, Spider-Man.

314
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,700
Ah, are you funny?   -Of course not.  Not!

315
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:48,960
So this is your costume?   -Unfortunately, this is my skin.

316
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,960
Oh shit.

317
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,810
You know, I'm your past.

318
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,130
A year ago.   -One moment.

319
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,850
Come on.

320
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,470
Look, I'm having fun   -Who are you talking to?

321
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,680
But we have to finish quickly.   -No, no, go on.

322
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,340
This is my job, sometimes very boring.

323
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,730
He is still there.

324
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,770
Okay, let's do it one last time.

325
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,900
My name is Miles Morales.

326
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,080
A radioactive spider bit me.

327
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,210
And for the past 1 year and 4 months, I've been the only Spider-Man in Brooklyn.

328
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:27,030
And everything went well.

329
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,580
hey hey hey

330
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,460
You are so painful.

331
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,220
I fight all kinds of bad guys.

332
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,250
In this villain, we see Frog-Man

333
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,500
Can't you act like a common criminal so I can catch you?

334
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,140
I designed my own costume and made it easy on the outside.

335
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,790
Aunt is going to Florida.   -Is ready.

336
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,530
I think I could be the judge.

337
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,840
I'm advertising baby powder.

338
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,560
I'm sorry I promoted baby powder.

339
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,540
I made a mistake.

340
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,160
Mine is out.

341
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,620
Error.

342
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,300
Then you go out.

343
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,010
I made another mistake.

344
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,610
New power options.

345
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,860
Excuse me.

346
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:12,810
How much longer can I lie about my identity?

347
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,070
I heard Spiderman is from Puerto Rico.

348
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,890
No, I think it's Dominica.

349
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:21,060
I mean, if I tell them, will they understand?

350
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:26,530
We love you and understand you even if you lied to us for a year.

351
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:29,710
Maybe in another world.

352
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,030
Sometimes I tell myself I wish I wasn't the only Spider-Man.

353
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,360
I'm bored.

354
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,210
Sometimes I miss them.

355
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,430
smile.

356
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:52,140
Although he turned out to be a thief.

357
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,120
I tried to do what he said.

358
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,660
Just to move on.

359
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,850
Dad: Where are you?  We are waiting for you.   -You read the message?

360
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,120
You know this is a life and death fight, right?   -Sorry Sorry.

361
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,190
Wait a minute my friend   -Dad: Honey, this is important.

362
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,950
No, no, no, just relax and do your job.

363
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,880
You turned your phone off at the movie, then didn't turn it off while you were fighting me?

364
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,310
"Finally," he said, "back up."

365
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,220
He wrote everything in one word.

366
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,530
Cool, right?

367
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,650
this child.

368
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,210
My godfather!

369
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:23,020
... sorry, the problem is somewhere

370
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:27,510
He wrote for a moment

371
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,960
I think this is going well

372
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,740
He is still writing

373
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:36,030
You know, I don't think that's a problem.

374
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,460
*

375
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,350
They are getting closer to us.

376
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:46,030
I've been waiting for this moment for a long time, so...

377
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,140
Hey, what's this goose?

378
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,680
I don't think I'll ever want this suit again.

379
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:55,270
I'm almost there, a mother with a smiling face.

380
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,860
*

381
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:08,020
In the end.    -I caught you.

382
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:12,950
I'm Spiderman and no one can run away from me.

383
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,460
Come back, we are sworn enemies.   -Do not run.

384
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,650
The back of your suit is very tight.

385
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,550
hi how are you

386
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,800
I am writing an article.

387
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,760
The bad guy on the roof is Peterson.

388
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:33,580
You can call the police. Tell them to arrest him.

389
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,270
I don't know, I feel like this is going to be my thing forever.

390
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,270
Only this time.

391
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:39,760
It started with calls, then wireless calls, then smartwatches.

392
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,590
Next month, I'll be your assistant.

393
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,270
I'm not your assistant

394
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,020
Are those my Jordans?

395
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:47,240
If they are the same size, I can't tell the difference.

396
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,580
See, everyone is the world.

397
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:07,480
And my job is to write your son's world on this piece of paper.

398
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,860
Goal   -That's great

399
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:13,750
I don't know this kid at all.

400
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,490
I don't know what he knows.

401
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:19,530
And he has to decide that he wants to commit to his future.

402
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:22,780
Or they engage in what they do when they come to school.

403
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,840
You can't have an ass and a date at the same time.

404
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,260
Unless you have a snorer.

405
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,290
Miles   -Of course, I know this is a good joke.

406
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,790
How are you?   -We have been waiting for a long time.

407
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:33,080
You're late   -You should have come earlier.

408
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,860
I know, I know, look.

409
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:38,300
I have to get back to homework, so can we get this over with?

410
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,380
Good.

411
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,580
Miles scores are almost good.

412
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:46,220
You are in the 18th grade of physics.

413
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,600
This is My Son.

414
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,580
And also in workshop art.

415
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,980
It disappeared.

416
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,220
You have 17 in English.

417
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,230
The teacher gave a difficult grade.

418
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,620
And the Spanish got 15.

419
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,130
What the?   -Oooh.

420
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:58,090
*

421
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,750
Mom, it's not my fault.

422
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,210
Does that mean it wasn't my fault?

423
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,730
Are you taking Spanish classes?

424
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,980
I just don't go to some classes.

425
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,270
Oh, so how much did you miss? How much means how much?

426
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,180
I mean there are 5.

427
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,200
Five?   -Five?

428
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,970
Actually 6.   -I'm going to skin you.

429
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,340
*

430
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,540
The whole story happened to me   -Very good.

431
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,070
We can still get out of this situation.

432
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,160
Excuse me, this situation?

433
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,340
Miles has a story to tell.

434
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,000
The story is not interesting at all.

435
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:27,580
Smith Miles Morales.   -Correct.

436
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:30,570
You grew up in a struggling immigrant family.

437
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:33,150
I'm from Puerto Rico, that's part of America.

438
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,860
We have a house in Brooklyn so we don't have a problem.

439
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:37,880
It doesn't matter, you're struggling too.

440
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,860
I will be captain next week.

441
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:42,860
And now he plans to get into the best physics program in the country.

442
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,330
We will do anything for him.

443
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,720
At Princeton University.

444
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:48,790
The one in New Jersey?

445
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,590
No, not at all, never too old.

446
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:54,120
New Jersey from New York?

447
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,630
There are many good universities in Brooklyn.

448
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,820
Princeton has the best quantum researchers in the country.   -Quantum researcher.

449
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,900
They transport electrons to the threshold of dimensions.  – Size threshold.

450
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,590
You could tell they were scanning the meter darkly.

451
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,270
No, I don't understand what he's saying.

452
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:10,730
I can help them find a way to travel to other dimensions.

453
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:13,730
Ah, good   -I think it's a good job.

454
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,230
Dad, when you were my age, you followed your dreams.

455
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:21,030
And you started your cartoon with Uncle Aaron, right?

456
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,510
He is different.

457
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:26,980
... i used to... see, when you were born... I was just my mother before

458
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:29,110
You see, life is an adventure.

459
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,900
You brought me to this school because you thought I could do something amazing.

460
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,840
And now I'm thinking the same thing.

461
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,770
And this is an amazing thing that they do.

462
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:43,940
Someone who can really teach me what I want.

463
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,440
But not all of them are in Brooklyn.

464
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,940
Here is your story.

465
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,080
Well, let's continue with that in mind.

466
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,030
Have you noticed?

467
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:05,800
Did Namusa get the joke?

468
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,280
Well, I have to go.   -Good.

469
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,060
It's a great topic to talk about.

470
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,210
See Miles Vaisa.

471
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,620
Did you order cake tonight?

472
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,550
Yes, Bau, you know, call me, I have to go.

473
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,380
Good?  Goodbye.

474
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:18,000
God, what should we do with this child?

475
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,710
For all units, we have supercriminal cases.

476
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,060
I have to go   -What?

477
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:24,230
You go too, Miles, everybody. Why should I stay?

478
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,620
Know.  Excuse me   -Why should I stay?

479
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,030
But we will find a way together.

480
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,290
And he.

481
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,580
I'm sorry, I'm very, very sorry.

482
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,790
He lied to you.    -Jeff?

483
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:38,190
Your son lied to him.

484
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,440
And I think you know that.

485
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,110
how is your article

486
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:45,790
The final work remains, it is part of the job.

487
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,300
No dad   -I think the guy ran away.

488
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,340
Thanks for saying I would see it.

489
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,010
Yes, you seem very busy.   -I agree.

490
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,940
You are too busy   -Yes, same conclusion.  Come see this.

491
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,260
Not very bad.   -Know.

492
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,840
What is the death of this child?

493
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,630
I don't know, God!  Hi

494
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,040
Spider-Man   -Mr. Morales, I mean Officer Morales.

495
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,630
It's not what you think

496
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,410
Hi!  Hey   -officer.

497
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,800
My son is a student here.

498
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,950
I am a member of the parents' association.

499
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,090
Do you know how much I have to pay for all this?

500
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:15,330
You gave up in the middle of the fight and left.

501
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:18,270
Your steps are very careless and rough.   -Namusa?

502
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,540
And the first thing is to show yourself.

503
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:22,070
Yeah, I agree with this guy.

504
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,790
Give it to me, this guy isn't even the villain of the week.

505
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,790
What are you telling me, do you know it's here?

506
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,260
Don't worry man.

507
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,850
Everything is under control.

508
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,380
And he.

509
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,200
We will definitely come back here again.

510
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,180
Know?  You are so much like that boy.

511
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:41,340
Really?

512
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,520
It's so stupid.

513
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,600
Imagine this.

514
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:47,050
We're going back to where it all began.

515
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,100
The birthplace of our connection.

516
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,180
Hey, don't try to please me with nice words.

517
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,180
I break tables every day.

518
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:04,150
Do you remember everything that happened?

519
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,620
what are you saying

520
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,020
Creative events.

521
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,490
What the.

522
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,320
Yes?   -Well, the call has been cut.

523
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:17,330
*

524
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,370
Look, we're in the middle of a story.

525
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,050
Fate brought us here.

526
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,780
You understand now, don't you?

527
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,300
I don't understand at all.

528
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,340
I am your sworn enemy.

529
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,650
You are not my sworn enemy.

530
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,790
You made a mistake.

531
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,590
*

532
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,080
Do you really not remember what you did to me?

533
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,580
What have I done for you?   -Um, no.

534
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:43,200
I worked at Alcomex.

535
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:48,740
I did an experiment on the interworld device that brought Spider-Man here from another dimension.

536
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:49,760
From size number 42.

537
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,360
*

538
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:54,720
The spider runs and bites you.

539
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:58,290
My Spider turns you into Spider-Man.

540
00:32:58,790 --> 00:32:59,620
What the.

541
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,530
You go to the buffet.

542
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,150
You hit me sweet

543
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:07,320
I beat the bad guys with a lot of food.

544
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:12,000
You flaunt your cheeky chops and everyone loves it.

545
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:16,650
But nobody knows what it means to be on the other side of the joke.

546
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,270
I just want to create a happy atmosphere.

547
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:19,740
i created you

548
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,510
You also created me.

549
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,970
Spiderman, why did you create this guy?   -I didn't get to Mola.

550
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,360
Tare said sleepily

551
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,180
When I was in this room, you blew it up.

552
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:43,680
Because of you, I lost my job, my life and my face.

553
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,980
My family doesn't even want to see me.

554
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,790
I made you a hero.

555
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,640
But you make me like this.

556
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,760
Look at me.

557
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,000
You brought me this disaster.

558
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,030
Look at me.

559
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,040
I will make you respect me.

560
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,760
I am your sworn enemy

561
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,230
So where did it disappear to?

562
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,830
He held her tight.

563
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:14,280
You know you have to catch the bad guy, right?

564
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,930
I always understand.

565
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:17,670
Usually.

566
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,560
Gutierrez, get the crane.

567
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,440
Good sir.

568
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,660
That's why they don't like our people, son.

569
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,620
We?

570
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,840
Look, I'm trying to do the right thing.

571
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,160
I said I was trying.

572
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,500
So you need to be a better role model.

573
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:30,300
I am a very good role model.

574
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:36,720
Hey Gutierrez, abort the crane.

575
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,640
Do you want to talk about it?

576
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,880
Are you confused about something?

577
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:50,140
Well, men of your generation neglect their mental health too

578
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,460
Oh boy

579
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,030
what am i doing wrong

580
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:56,490
Because no matter what I do, there's always someone who thinks I'm wrong

581
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,000
I know how it feels

582
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:06,080
So how is your son doing?

583
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,810
Do you think he can handle his life?

584
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,670
tell the truth yes

585
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,280
He's a good kid   -seriously?    -

586
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,490
you know, scary

587
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,090
He said very wise things

588
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:18,040
... It is so good.  Well, I have to go little by little

589
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,480
And then he did this really stupid thing

590
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,220
I just don't want him to ruin his life

591
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,460
Maybe it's best to leave him alone

592
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,350
excuse me, what   -What?  What happened?   -

593
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,530
I do not know

594
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,950
And I hate that he's not honest with me

595
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:34,620
Maybe he is afraid to talk to you

596
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:37,130
Why would anyone be afraid to talk to me?

597
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,050
What should I know?

598
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:42,190
The point is, you think you're a

599
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:44,170
good father, you think everything is fine

600
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,530
And then they grow

601
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:51,710
I just don't want to lose him, you know?

602
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:03,600
Well, as someone who is not in this position and is not in your family

603
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,470
I say you should let him stand on his own two feet, man

604
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,630
so yes   -

605
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,470
You are right

606
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,730
If that's not good, then what is?

607
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:29,350
I have to go now

608
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:32,460
Yes, and catch him on

609
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,630
bastard, don't worry

610
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:36,030
I don't think that person will ever show up again

611
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:37,960
What happened?

612
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,890
Good

613
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:45,290
I think I threw myself into it

614
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:48,390
Well, it's new

615
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,850
!Hello

616
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:50,620
!Hello

617
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,560
One, two, three, three, three, no, no echo

618
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,710
assumption

619
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,440
I stuck my head in the hole

620
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,070
!Hello

621
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,360
Stop it, stop it

622
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,460
How cool is that?

623
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:15,000
My hole can take me anywhere

624
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,490
Chinatown Earth  -688 Venom World Tom Hardy

625
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,420
Sorry, hello

626
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,100
Sorry to bother you, I know you are busy

627
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,480
What do you want?   -I know it's weird.  I found Abad out of nowhere   -

628
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:32,480
But I think I've turned into an extraordinary metadimensional being

629
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,780
GOOD?    -GOOD?    -

630
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:37,850
I literally tore apart the fabric of time and space

631
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,850
It's like Thursday night for you

632
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:42,640
You act like these weird things always happen to you

633
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,340
can i have a piece of gum please

634
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:54,310
The power of the multiverse is in the palm of my hand(a dialogue similar to that of the famous Doctor Octopus)

635
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,010
My hole is not a curse

636
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,180
They didn't answer

637
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,160
Can you stop talking about your holes?

638
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,000
A series of tormented children

639
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,090
No, no, no, you'll love it

640
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,120
Look, look, look

641
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:08,930
My place is over, you don't understand

642
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,580
Um, get down to business, gentlemen

643
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,350
I'm coming for you, Spiderman!

644
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:21,830
Oh no

645
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,850
Peter Parker, Spider-Man Earth  -13122

646
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,140
Tomorrow morning, there will be a picture of Spiderman on the front page.

647
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,500
The photos have to be good this time. You're absolutely right, boss.

648
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,360
shut up get out   -hey boss...

649
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,430
I'm going to work, God, I want a replacement

650
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,670
Miguel, I'm Peter

651
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,980
We have an anomaly

652
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,710
Thanks Peter, you are one of the best

653
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,000
Jess, who's gonna get it?

654
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,220
Can't you see Miles?    -Not

655
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,220
Can't you see Miles?    -Not

656
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,180
Haven't you seen Miles?

657
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,220
What are you doing now?

658
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:04,970
Give a speech   -what?

659
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,440
Okay, everyone's listening.   -Not.

660
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,220
Everybody's listening, I'm with everybody.

661
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:09,980
Have mercy, Lord

662
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,140
Rio, speak up

663
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:15,450
Hello

664
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,690
And I want you to know, no matter what.

665
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,820
Even though we have had our ups and downs, I am

666
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,460
so proud of you today, I will always be proud

667
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,180
Write in parentheses

668
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,710
Most of the time lol

669
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,250
Hey Mr. Spiderman

670
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,030
It doesn't go well with the cake

671
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,180
Congrats on the promotion, Dad!

672
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:31,920
Can't you write smaller?

673
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,880
Can you say a little more text?

674
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,080
come to us again

675
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,580
What else can I say about Jeff?

676
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,040
As a child, he weighed almost 4.5 kilograms

677
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,580
I know, I know you're ashamed of yourself for saying that

678
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:46,370
his mother must have died in childbirth

679
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:47,260
Look at his shoulders

680
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:49,540
Oh no.  Well, that's enough.  fine

681
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:50,630
Oh gosh

682
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,720
Very good.

683
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,080
Just give me the microphone, that's enough

684
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,940
Good.  Thank you Rio John for your speech   -Who is this child?

685
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:00,950
You know, I don't always know what to do with my life

686
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:04,990
When I was young, I was drawn to many different paths

687
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,040
When my brother and I came to this neighborhood, there were only a few people on Jalan Velo

688
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:19,560
You kicked us out of the store and now no one thinks I'm protecting you

689
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:26,310
And then I had a baby and things started to get better

690
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:31,320
And I don't know why you drink for my health because I have to drink for your health

691
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:32,230
...Meanwhile, the cake is in the car

692
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:41,060
So out of respect for my brother who misses us everyday I bet he's laughing out loud right now

693
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,740
Aaron Davis, the dear uncle of his soul mate

694
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,310
Brothers, they made me captain

695
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,680
Out of respect for my wife my love I don't even know where to start because it never ends

696
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,490
Don't take my microphone

697
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,730
And in honor of my son

698
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:08,540
The main reason I do these things is because I'm in love with Miles

699
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:13,260
And I will always be there for you

700
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,320
Benny June, please play again

701
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:26,080
I will kill this child

702
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:28,110
Hey, congratulations

703
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:30,600
Thank you for coming

704
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:51,130
Hey Miles, where have you been?   -What is it?    -

705
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:54,680
Hey, did you study well?   -Yes, i read it...

706
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,290
Hello

707
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:59,130
Hey, your parents are looking for you.  I

708
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,510
don't know why I've been here all this time

709
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:02,290
Aha, I understand

710
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:03,830
Hi, you should be here at 5...

711
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,700
I know, I know, I know   -you disrespect your father   -

712
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,050
Yes   -you lost the beautiful Sankhrani   -

713
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,780
Never mind, have you seen Kika yet?

714
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:11,720
Well written posts

715
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,590
"I'm not proud of you"

716
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,120
I don't want to say that

717
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:19,240
Your father studied for eight months

718
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,990
Nine months is like a pregnancy

719
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,200
No, not at all   -of course not   -

720
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:24,610
you have to sit in that lady's office and we'll talk without going anywhere

721
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:26,090
It was an emergency, what was

722
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,680
this just now? Emergency graffiti?

723
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,680
Is there an emergency party with your friends that I've never come across?

724
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:30,510
explain think you have

725
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:32,430
explained completely

726
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,760
funny

727
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,160
Our son Jeff is

728
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,090
funny, I'm not laughing

729
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,370
Hello

730
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:39,690
Ahab, what a beautiful family

731
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,520
mature boy

732
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,940
I don't feel mature

733
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,140
Wow, what a beautiful dress

734
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:45,150
Good, good, good

735
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:46,690
did you eat that food

736
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:50,980
hey where

737
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,680
Who do you live with?

738
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,720
...just   -Genki?    -

739
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:54,620
I never liked

740
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,510
You do not like it

741
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:56,620
He called me by my first name

742
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,700
Oh how I hate this job, I have

743
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:59,490
other friends besides Ganki

744
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,350
For example, who?

745
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:05,090
For example, Peter, yes, you know Peter, but he's left town for now

746
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:10,080
Oh, Gwanda, he left town too

747
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,760
Miles, don't worry about who you love

748
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:13,020
do you speak spanglish

749
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:17,720
Has it ever occurred to you that maybe I'm not in front of you?

750
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:20,270
Am I doing normal personal work safely?

751
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,090
absolutely not   -

752
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:23,980
I am 15 years old and I am considered an adult

753
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,770
Oh, that's right

754
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,730
you don't even have a driver's license   -not even mom   -

755
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:29,230
Because we live in New York, we never plan to go

756
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:30,270
This is my life.

757
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:31,660
This is not your life.

758
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:38,580
This is my life, your father's life and your grandfather's life, whoever brought you here.

759
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:40,790
Okay, now anything, anything.

760
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,600
Up to you?

761
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:45,470
wow

762
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:46,710
Up to you?

763
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:48,470
I can say?

764
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:49,870
Please tell me that

765
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,660
I know you're not allowed to go out

766
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:51,660
What is it   -

767
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:53,770
While?  Dad   -a month   -

768
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,420
Ma'am, are you serious?

769
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,550
Yes, we're serious

770
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:57,730
1 you don't understand

771
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:59,150
You're right, I have no

772
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,800
idea what's going on here

773
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:02,820
So why didn't you tell me?

774
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:04,060
just listen to me

775
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:05,170
Okay, Pahlavi, I'm listening,

776
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:06,560
tell me to see

777
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:07,870
Say whatever you want

778
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:10,140
What do you want to tell me?

779
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,050
you know what doesn't matter at all

780
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,390
Very well, go

781
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,290
Because your sentence is already two months

782
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:34,590
Isn't that great?

783
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:45,070
two months

784
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:49,090
I'm sick and I'm not allowed to go out

785
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:30,360
The Amazing Fantasy Comic 1962 #15

786
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:43,880
Miles, Miles

787
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,260
Do you have a minute?

788
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,700
... how... how is it here?

789
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:53,080
How are you, um... how are you?

790
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,770
I'm fine thanks

791
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,400
Yeah, it's good

792
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,770
to see you grow up

793
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:00,780
Growth spurt during puberty yes

794
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,810
The mute became even pinker

795
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:04,840
Is this the room you grew up in?

796
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:05,790
Here he was

797
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:09,700
But my dorm room is very mature

798
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,660
So cool, I used to play with this when I was younger

799
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:14,310
This for the collection

800
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:15,180
I have the same thing

801
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:17,130
In fact, it is extremely rare

802
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:18,970
Why is it still in the package?

803
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:22,920
Good

804
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:25,590
Is this your design?

805
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:27,330
They are good?

806
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,610
wow how much

807
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,650
I miss you too

808
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:42,860
So what are you doing here?  I thought... that I would never see you again

809
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,290
Do you want to get out of here?

810
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,280
I... I'm not allowed to go out

811
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:50,280
against the present

812
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:55,570
Spider-Man is not allowed?

813
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,950
... Well

814
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,460
Miles

815
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:10,230
Your father is ready to listen to you now

816
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,130
It's three months

817
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:22,630
Okay, let me see

818
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:26,060
Is there an anthology community where all Spideys belong?

819
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:28,130
Well, there is also a woman, Jess Drew (who is white)

820
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:29,210
The car works

821
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,560
God, how much can I learn from him   -cars?   -

822
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:33,700
Yes, I learned a lot

823
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,440
I've improved a lot, see?

824
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:37,600
Seriously?

825
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:38,550
So let's see

826
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:39,420
!Let's go

827
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,440
Get started!

828
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:50,270
That's not a problem at all

829
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,880
And he said it changed everything

830
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:55,350
Who are Sahih and Miguel?

831
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,820
He's a ninja vampire spider, but he's a good person

832
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:02,050
Good vampire?  I never saw him in my dream

833
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,010
So how long has he been inviting you?

834
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:06,030
That was just a few months ago

835
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:08,150
A few months is a long time, right?

836
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:09,790
One or two months

837
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,000
see you

838
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:19,450
look at me

839
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:22,290
Thanks James

840
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:24,520
Well, this group of you   -look at those idiots   -

841
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:26,940
how do you work   -The man is striped, he wants to carry a bag   -

842
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,660
We are trying to prevent the collapse of the multiverse

843
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,200
I think I've done this before

844
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:33,870
For example, last week we had an assignment based on Shakespeare

845
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:35,350
John?    -... and me and the husband   -

846
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,950
Hey, let's see who's Hobby?

847
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:39,020
God, you're going to love it

848
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:40,830
Sometimes he let me follow him

849
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:41,970
What this means?

850
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,310
... are you a monkey all night?

851
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:48,030
Don't worry, they're very strict about me coming and going, otherwise I'll see you sooner

852
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:49,310
Correct

853
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,460
So why are you here now?

854
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,410
Inka... don't do that, uncle

855
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,800
Hey go... Gwen?

856
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:00,700
Where do you want to go?

857
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:04,890
Where is he going?

858
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:19,260
hello so you are here

859
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,230
What are you doing now?

860
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:21,250
I'm waiting for you

861
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,170
It's a good place to think   -don't you agree?   -

862
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:44,510
I mean, who needs a treadmill when you've got the Williamsburg Bank Building right at your fingertips

863
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:51,600
So you and your dad haven't talked yet?

864
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,760
What exactly do we want to talk about?

865
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:57,190
Hi dad, how long has it been?

866
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:00,330
Do you still think I killed my best friend?

867
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:04,090
I do not know

868
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:07,000
... I mean, my family might if I told them that

869
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:08,180
Do not say

870
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:10,440
Hear me on this matter

871
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:31,890
Well, maybe some things are meant for us

872
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:37,930
What an interesting way of thinking

873
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:42,700
Just smart guys with emotions

874
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:45,220
Out of the norm

875
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:50,630
You know, it's always a pleasure talking to you

876
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,120
Really?

877
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:53,180
Yes

878
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:57,860
How many people can you talk to about such things?

879
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,460
you don't even think about me

880
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:05,740
What the?

881
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:11,080
you were the only true friend i found after peter's death

882
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,820
Other than Hobby?

883
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:17,340
That case is different

884
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,330
Huh?  I don't know what you say

885
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:25,650
... you and me... you are the important thing

886
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:29,950
We are alike

887
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:31,550
Know

888
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:37,840
In any other world, Gwen Stacy fell in love with Spider-Man

889
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:49,320
And that doesn't end well in any other world

890
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:03,540
Well, everything has a beginning, right?

891
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:28,340
Wow, no matter what I eat, I can't get enough

892
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,070
This palantano will open a space in your heart(famous Cuban food)

893
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,980
The girl was very white and blonde

894
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:38,390
I bet he can't even speak Spanish

895
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:40,340
Does not matter

896
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,320
Does this prevent you from interfering in other dimensions?

897
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:44,240
Yes, it's very cool

898
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:47,940
How long did it take Miguel O'Hara to notice Miles Morales?

899
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:49,790
I will compliment you, I said the same thing,

900
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:52,390
if I had a bracelet I could come with you

901
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,800
See Miles I saved the multiverse

902
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:56,830
They were just a small elite strike force

903
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:57,910
I can become invisible, I

904
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,280
have power like electricity

905
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,050
There is no more room

906
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,740
Oh right

907
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:08,430
... look, if it's really my hand, I   -yes, I know, I know, I know   -

908
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,640
Oh, no, no, don't do that

909
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:13,770
Miles

910
00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:14,600
ok now

911
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:15,820
It is very sensitive

912
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,360
Sorry, I didn't mean to yell

913
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,810
No problem, very good

914
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,480
Excuse me

915
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,680
Hello!

916
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:26,300
Hi, I want to be a mother

917
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:27,730
Hello Rio!

918
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,520
I hear a lot from you

919
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:30,680
You say my first name

920
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:32,210
Very good

921
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:36,570
...I found this in Miles' room, so I assume you were there too

922
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:38,610
You must be Jeff too   -You call me Jeff

923
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,030
So sweet, Jeff

924
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:44,280
You mean Lieutenant Moralze, soon to be Captain

925
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:45,990
hey captain

926
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:50,440
Gwanda and I have only been friends since school

927
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,990
Yes Yes.  We wondered for a while

928
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:55,470
Don't Take My Mailzo   -Mom   -

929
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,410
I joked

930
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:58,790
He can't go out until you come

931
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,270
Don't break her heart   -Mom   -

932
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,350
!Damn it!

933
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:03,070
Damn, I have to go   -really?    -

934
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:05,830
Yes, I forgot to take a walk today

935
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:07,810
I really want to stay longer

936
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:09,330
Excuse me

937
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:11,430
Goodbye

938
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:16,860
Goodbye

939
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:53,630
I can even hear your silence, mother

940
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:58,910
I... I hope I didn't mess things up

941
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:02,830
No one my age says those words in that order, Mom

942
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:09,150
It is very hard to see that my little boy is no longer a child

943
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:12,140
I understand

944
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,310
you can tell me anything you want

945
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,970
*

946
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:30,420
...GOOD

947
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,240
...I

948
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,580
I'm sorry I'm late

949
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:10,080
Go

950
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:14,820
She seems like a good girl

951
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,210
Do you want to touch my head?

952
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:19,440
No, I do not want

953
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:20,960
Lord

954
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:23,920
...what are you doing   -let me mend your clothes   -

955
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:28,270
I've been taking care of this little boy for so many years, haven't I?

956
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:31,490
I'm sure she will be loved

957
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:35,850
So that he feels a sense of belonging wherever he wants

958
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:40,780
Now he wants to go out into the world and do the dirty work

959
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:47,730
And what worries me the most is that they are not as careful as we are

960
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:51,550
They can't support you like we can

961
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,370
... that's how it was decided then

962
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:02,340
Wherever you go from now on, you must promise to take care of that little boy

963
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:05,110
Make sure he never forgets where he came from

964
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,690
There is no doubt that he is loved

965
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:20,000
And he didn't allow anyone in that big, fancy place to tell him he didn't belong

966
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:24,260
And he better come back every time he comes home

967
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,680
you can't be late

968
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:31,340
And it's better to have a good regular cake

969
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:33,280
Good

970
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:35,050
You have to promise Miles

971
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,900
I promise

972
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:41,300
Just...don't get lost

973
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:43,590
OK   -do you understand?    -

974
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,230
Yes

975
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,380
Hilaire

976
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:51,260
Goodbye, dear mother

977
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:54,410
God bless you my dear

978
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,480
Now get out of here

979
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:02,540
When you return, your punishment will continue

980
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:05,950
I'm smiling like it's a joke, but it's true

981
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:07,420
Yes I understand

982
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:10,100
see you

983
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:11,450
With cake

984
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,320
!Damn it!

985
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,880
Hey, hey, the car's gone

986
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:19,260
Oh shit

987
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:31,060
Darkness detected counter

988
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:33,440
Dr. Jonathan Ohne, former Alcomex employee

989
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:38,360
Earth  -42 is dead

990
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,400
show me what happened

991
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:42,500
Start playback

992
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:45,430
!stain, yes, I want more stain

993
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:49,850
my god!  I don't really have eyes in front of me

994
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:52,740
I just need the next dose of fuel or whatever

995
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:54,390
I never gave it a name   -dammit   -

996
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:55,870
I never knew how to give a good name

997
00:59:55,890 --> 01:00:01,440
Power lines in the city can generate more dark energy for my prototype device

998
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:04,300
Damn   -I love this science   -

999
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:09,680
It just needs to take me to a place where I can find the device in the real world

1000
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:16,620
And Spiderman, I'll make you pay back

1001
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:18,150
everything you took from me, you must answer

1002
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,670
Or vaporize me and everyone in this building

1003
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:23,670
Sacrifice my head

1004
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:24,980
damn it   -

1005
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:29,780
I did

1006
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:39,600
What happens

1007
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,450
your dog

1008
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:51,090
Playback is complete

1009
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:53,390
No, why, why, why, why?

1010
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:55,390
Gwen, Gwen, Gwen, Gwen, Gwen

1011
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:56,590
Gwen!

1012
01:00:56,610 --> 01:00:57,500
Hello

1013
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,920
What is it?

1014
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:00,500
Nothing ah, everything is fine

1015
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,410
Everything is fine, yes, everything is fine

1016
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:03,930
Goodbye

1017
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:07,210
Where is the person you should be paying attention to?

1018
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:09,110
He went for a short walk   -Hajj   -

1019
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:11,110
Look, he's just a common criminal.

1020
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:13,030
... oh, no need   -follow   -

1021
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,290
Look here, I found it, no, I didn't

1022
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,470
Wait

1023
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:17,720
How much round trip?

1024
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:19,990
Did you go meet your friend?   -What the?  NOT   -

1025
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:21,330
... miles?  Means

1026
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:22,770
Namosa, are you putting your head on mine now?

1027
01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:24,230
I see her a little

1028
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,810
Far   -how far?    -

1029
01:01:25,830 --> 01:01:30,690
you know, so... no, it's too close...

1030
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:31,900
!Face

1031
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,260
I just want to know how things are going

1032
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:36,190
I really don't like this card at all

1033
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:37,520
Look, I know I messed up, okay?

1034
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:39,230
He should have no role in this case

1035
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:40,450
Know

1036
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:43,380
I'll never see him again, okay?   -What the?    -

1037
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,280
I'm not kidding

1038
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:46,810
Hey guys, he made a portal

1039
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:49,060
What   -He can go anywhere he wants   -

1040
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,880
Can now completely destroy all main events

1041
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:52,650
You said this guy was a common criminal

1042
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:54,380
Do you have any idea how bad this case is for you?

1043
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,390
Whenever there is an Alcomex company, it will shut down

1044
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:58,120
What's the plan, Gwen?   -I do not know   -

1045
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:00,300
It got stronger so you can beat me

1046
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:01,470
It is so beautiful!

1047
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:03,100
This is from my smart student

1048
01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:04,720
I'll take it, okay?

1049
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:06,570
I can compensate

1050
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,090
...If Miguel finds out, I'll leave you

1051
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:09,680
Don't tell Miguel

1052
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:13,250
What if he kicks me out and sends me home?

1053
01:02:14,370 --> 01:02:15,350
I found him

1054
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:17,050
Land  -505101

1055
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:19,240
So what should we do?

1056
01:02:21,310 --> 01:02:23,090
Have you never done anything wrong?

1057
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:25,420
Have you ever been too close to someone?

1058
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,610
Why

1059
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,140
But I got over it

1060
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:34,100
Tell Spider-Man there

1061
01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:35,910
Tell him Gwen met him.

1062
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:37,310
Thank you very much

1063
01:02:37,310 --> 01:02:38,520
He promised you he wouldn't let you down.

1064
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:39,820
Now shut up

1065
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:43,130
You have one hour to make this story

1066
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:45,130
Otherwise, I can't help you

1067
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:14,320
Hello Miles

1068
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:24,190
Sorry sorry sorry

1069
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:33,570
Sol  -50101 Barrier

1070
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:39,460
See?  Great, I feel like a new

1071
01:04:39,490 --> 01:04:40,370
person, where do you want to go?

1072
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:41,980
If I look in the mirror now, I don't recognize myself

1073
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,080
Stay somewhere else

1074
01:04:43,110 --> 01:04:44,680
But I envy the old me

1075
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:45,790
I see your confusion

1076
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:46,740
Try to get it

1077
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:48,530
Stop complaining, you're really complaining

1078
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:49,890
Hello, sorry, locals

1079
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,570
It is very dangerous for four people to sit on a motorcycle

1080
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:53,840
Looks delicious

1081
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:55,170
Where is Alcomex located?

1082
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,640
How sharp it is

1083
01:04:56,830 --> 01:04:58,400
Where there is a large device between the worlds

1084
01:04:59,330 --> 01:05:01,190
Hey shepherd, come here

1085
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:02,380
Is your sense of humor natural?

1086
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,090
Gwen, I'm here to help you

1087
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:06,020
Miles?    -How does the palm feel?    -

1088
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,920
you didn't expect it, did you?

1089
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:08,920
Oh no, me neither

1090
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:10,980
I did it well

1091
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:15,660
i have you if you follow me

1092
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:19,960
No, I just saw where you were going and went there

1093
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:21,550
not realizing you shouldn't be here

1094
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:22,510
what did you say?

1095
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:24,720
I always... no

1096
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:27,880
No, fog, no, no, no, no

1097
01:05:31,950 --> 01:05:33,970
I shouldn't have come to see you at all

1098
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:35,450
hi dad

1099
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:45,540
Hey, who's that new guy?

1100
01:05:45,570 --> 01:05:48,580
Hi, this is a letter and not an invitation

1101
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:51,360
Oh, you weren't invited, but you're back

1102
01:05:51,390 --> 01:05:54,080
NOT?   -Hey, this new guy must be in love with you   -

1103
01:05:54,110 --> 01:05:55,850
Ah, no   -no, no   -

1104
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:57,330
I am very good at meeting people

1105
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:58,160
No, it's not   -who are you?    -

1106
01:05:58,190 --> 01:06:00,440
Glad you asked the newbie   -I'm not a newbie   -

1107
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,860
My name is Pravitra Prabhakare

1108
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,820
...and the last six months   -six?   -

1109
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:06,160
And does this even have a bracelet?

1110
01:06:06,190 --> 01:06:09,070
Yes   -it's easy to be Spiderman   -

1111
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:12,810
I wake up, I don't work out because I'm naturally fit and I don't want to gain too much weight, you know?

1112
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:14,680
I have almost nothing to do with superhuman hairstyles

1113
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:16,360
Does that mean you don't put anything in your hair?

1114
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:18,210
Just coconut oil, prayers and some good genes

1115
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:20,830
Then I sneaked off to school.  There's really no need for this, but I'll do it again, I'll fight

1116
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:25,050
with the bad boys, I will feed the street dogs, take a short break and have tea with my aunt.

1117
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,610
i love tea what are

1118
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:28,870
you saying now tea tea?

1119
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:30,810
Tea means tea

1120
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:32,080
brother, you say tea tea

1121
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:34,140
Did I say I want coffee with cream?

1122
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

1123
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:38,350
After that I spent some time with my friend Gayatri

1124
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:40,720
He is a very stylish teenager

1125
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:41,540
Hello, girl

1126
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:43,220
I'm thinking about tonight

1127
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:45,120
Hello Police Inspector Singh

1128
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:47,370
She's your daughter and I don't know her

1129
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:51,520
And most importantly, I live in the best city for Spiderman, Mombatan

1130
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:53,150
A quick introduction here is traffic

1131
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:55,390
There is traffic here, there is more traffic here, there is traffic everywhere

1132
01:06:55,410 --> 01:06:57,160
Here the British stole all our equipment

1133
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:02,360
hello spiderman   -hello   -

1134
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:03,660
Hey   -I'm not with you guys   -

1135
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:05,350
... with me or him or   -who are you talking to?   -

1136
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:07,220
I think he means me   -yes, I mean him   -

1137
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:09,010
I got it guys

1138
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:10,810
oh how are you

1139
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:14,170
Are you trying to make my game harder?

1140
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:16,120
I am on the road to self  -realization

1141
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:18,150
Boy!  you came to india

1142
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,150
This is a Western cultural stereotype

1143
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:21,800
*

1144
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:23,150
No, no, no, no, I didn't mean it like that

1145
01:07:23,170 --> 01:07:23,990
Now let me guess

1146
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:30,250
By now you must be asking me about turmeric, cardamom and non  -non  -cai tea

1147
01:07:30,270 --> 01:07:31,270
Oh, I like tea

1148
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:32,400
NOT!

1149
01:07:33,570 --> 01:07:34,860
no worries man i think

1150
01:07:34,910 --> 01:07:37,030
there was a misunderstanding

1151
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:38,220
Let's talk

1152
01:07:38,370 --> 01:07:40,200
Okay, you make me feel empty

1153
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:41,800
It was as if a hole had been made inside me

1154
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:43,260
Many potholes on the road

1155
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:47,070
But now I understand what to fill this hole with

1156
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:48,290
More holes

1157
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:50,120
This makes absolutely no sense

1158
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:51,330
Makes sense

1159
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:53,780
Good.  I'm fine, don't worry

1160
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:57,140
This emotional conflict is very real

1161
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:58,250
Did they contact me? Can't you reach me?

1162
01:07:58,270 --> 01:08:00,980
If Spot makes more holes, he will become invincible

1163
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:02,630
...can't we let him go to Alcomex?   -

1164
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:05,200
How can you focus?

1165
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:09,830
Hey, do you know anything about Hobie?   -What should I know about hobbies?    -

1166
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:11,840
It's like he doesn't know

1167
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:20,470
please go and see you later

1168
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:24,070
Hey, can you help us disable this powerful energy wall?

1169
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,800
It cannot be turned off until the device's activity between worlds is finished

1170
01:08:26,830 --> 01:08:28,260
Devices between worlds?

1171
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:34,030
You have to stop   -what are you doing man...

1172
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:37,000
I will become more than just a criminal

1173
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:39,210
I'm sorry I said that, okay?

1174
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:40,480
you are a big criminal

1175
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:42,200
Well, not yet

1176
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:44,040
Setting up an interworld device

1177
01:08:44,070 --> 01:08:45,080
!NOT

1178
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,070
What is the situation now?

1179
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:53,160
!Very good

1180
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:54,460
Does anyone have any idea how to open it?

1181
01:08:54,490 --> 01:08:57,350
I have many ideas, but

1182
01:08:57,370 --> 01:08:58,630
that's not why you sit back

1183
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:00,590
I'm working on something new

1184
01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:14,030
I do not understand what is going on

1185
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:15,490
Just give me a second

1186
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,980
Do you want us to do something or just sit here?

1187
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,390
For example, are you uploading?

1188
01:09:19,410 --> 01:09:21,660
No, I pulled it so I could shoot

1189
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,490
*

1190
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:24,690
Save your question for

1191
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:26,170
later, i can't open it like that

1192
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:28,360
Let me do my job

1193
01:09:42,190 --> 01:09:43,190
Interests

1194
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:44,710
O Hobby, in  -laws   -Hobby?    -

1195
01:09:44,730 --> 01:09:45,780
See here, one more thing I like

1196
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:48,450
the difference between your versions

1197
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:50,330
I'm doing it in slow motion

1198
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:50,940
Do you agree?

1199
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:51,940
What is this person's name?

1200
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:55,430
The English term for us is we are close friends

1201
01:09:55,450 --> 01:09:56,690
*

1202
01:09:56,710 --> 01:09:58,010
Do you understand what he said?

1203
01:09:58,050 --> 01:10:00,390
Hey Hobie, thanks, you cracked the shield

1204
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:02,250
I gave it free   -I have a suggestion   -

1205
01:10:02,350 --> 01:10:03,940
Use your palms, not just your fingers

1206
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:06,210
What's wrong with your clothes?

1207
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:07,340
Are they bleeding from their armpits?

1208
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:08,680
Miles, this is Hobie Hobie, this is Miles

1209
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:11,700
Hi, I haven't heard from you since Gwen didn't say anything

1210
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:13,950
Hi, my name is Hobie, Hobie Brown

1211
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:16,570
Did something bite me, you say?

1212
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:20,380
...and for the last three years I just waited, waited, waited, waited

1213
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:22,790
Do you think I want to reveal my secret identity?  Do not worry about me

1214
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:26,330
Then he was involved in a show of hostilities with the fascists, singing on stage,

1215
01:10:26,350 --> 01:10:31,020
Political activist and performer of art or past, you

1216
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:32,050
want me not to be with Amkau, I am not a good role model

1217
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:33,610
I was a Ferrari model for a short time

1218
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:36,500
I hate mornings, I hate nights,

1219
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:37,590
I hate headlines, I'm not a hero

1220
01:10:37,590 --> 01:10:41,950
When you call yourself a hero, you become a very

1221
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:43,460
ambitious narcissist, I think you hate titles

1222
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:45,450
Gwen, you left your clothes at my house

1223
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:47,140
Which dress?    -sweater  -

1224
01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:48,650
how many shirts do you have

1225
01:10:48,670 --> 01:10:50,510
This is not a permanent job

1226
01:10:50,530 --> 01:10:52,410
And you left my toothbrush   -Vaisa, what?   -

1227
01:10:52,970 --> 01:10:54,300
it's my shoe

1228
01:10:56,910 --> 01:10:58,380
Team Khafni Mishida

1229
01:10:58,410 --> 01:11:00,810
I don't believe in the team   -aren't you a band?   -

1230
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,480
I don't believe in stability

1231
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:04,160
Boy, how nervous is this guy

1232
01:11:05,810 --> 01:11:07,490
It will be good for us, Spiderman

1233
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:12,000
You and I will finally live up to our potential

1234
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:16,770
You'll finally have a tough villain to fight and I'll stop being a joke to you

1235
01:11:26,690 --> 01:11:28,290
You're not a joke, are you?

1236
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,770
Of course   -much taller than you   -

1237
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:31,340
I don't believe in humor at all

1238
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:32,760
Just kidding

1239
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:33,770
See?

1240
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:35,380
No one thinks you're a joke

1241
01:11:35,410 --> 01:11:36,960
After that, no one will think so

1242
01:11:36,990 --> 01:11:38,120
!NOT

1243
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:46,500
Well, this is from a light Spider-Man adventure   -no, no, no, no   -

1244
01:12:16,390 --> 01:12:17,700
What else is this?

1245
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:21,990
our future

1246
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:28,560
I will take everything from you like you took everything from me

1247
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:31,270
What the

1248
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:33,100
see you at home

1249
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:35,700
Spider Man

1250
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:40,820
!Mile...Mile

1251
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:42,940
Come on son... we have to go

1252
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,960
*

1253
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,270
Guys, move, move

1254
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:07,240
We take people off the street, you stop our building

1255
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:09,870
Okay, I'm fine, but not because you told me to

1256
01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:19,380
They all evacuated here

1257
01:13:37,070 --> 01:13:38,390
*

1258
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:15,810
Gayatri

1259
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,300
!NOT

1260
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:28,890
Gwen, be careful

1261
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:31,940
The indicator predicts the occurrence of major events.  Act carefully

1262
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:34,040
Hilaire

1263
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:36,930
someone help

1264
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:38,730
Everyone hurry up!  Faster

1265
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:41,070
Don't worry, I'm coming

1266
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:46,750
Inspector Singh

1267
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:54,220
I can do both

1268
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:59,910
I like it, I like it   -Miles   -

1269
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:01,980
Do not worry *

1270
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,390
It's very dangerous   -we can't do this.  I promise   -

1271
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,200
Miles and miles!  NOT

1272
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:22,120
Miles

1273
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,790
!No No no no no NO

1274
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:27,890
Please no

1275
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:29,370
Miles, Jr

1276
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:36,760
Are you ok?

1277
01:15:37,070 --> 01:15:38,270
I promise

1278
01:15:44,610 --> 01:15:46,090
Are you ok?  I'm so worried about you

1279
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:50,420
I mean you look like a pretty young woman I don't know

1280
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:51,860
Father

1281
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:52,870
Gayatri

1282
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:56,400
Father

1283
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:58,820
Not bad?

1284
01:16:00,570 --> 01:16:02,190
The main event had a problem

1285
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,300
this is correct

1286
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:08,240
I've never seen him so excited

1287
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:09,560
The card is wonderful

1288
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:23,740
Miles has nothing to do with me

1289
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,300
So what do you think?

1290
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,980
Something I always think about

1291
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:41,960
You are extraordinary

1292
01:16:43,690 --> 01:16:45,140
We will be a good team

1293
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:47,030
NOT?

1294
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:48,770
Yes

1295
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,580
What are friends?

1296
01:16:57,980 --> 01:16:59,840
It is a memory for the capitalist system

1297
01:17:01,810 --> 01:17:03,230
Much worse than that

1298
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:12,440
All right, guys, evacuate the area and get the people out of here

1299
01:17:12,450 --> 01:17:14,250
And let's control this quantum hole

1300
01:17:14,270 --> 01:17:15,370
Hi, I'm Miles

1301
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,720
Actually, we've met before,

1302
01:17:17,740 --> 01:17:19,470
when i was invisible i know who you are

1303
01:17:22,570 --> 01:17:24,430
Will everything be okay?

1304
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:34,740
OK, let me explain

1305
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,250
Miguel wants to go to headquarters

1306
01:17:36,270 --> 01:17:37,640
Miles walks away slowly

1307
01:17:37,670 --> 01:17:38,740
You guys didn't follow

1308
01:17:38,770 --> 01:17:40,490
orders and neither did they

1309
01:17:40,510 --> 01:17:41,930
Was I invited to the headquarters?

1310
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:59,750
How are you even dumber behind your mask?

1311
01:18:00,090 --> 01:18:01,890
I'm always angry

1312
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:11,110
Wow!

1313
01:18:15,350 --> 01:18:18,230
New York Earth  -928

1314
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,000
Hey, over here

1315
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:28,300
Wow, it's so stuffy in here

1316
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:29,920
Any news about the place?   -let me ask   -

1317
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:32,110
Hey, has anyone seen that place?  (In English also means visible point) Malala Windsor, Spider UK Earth  -835

1318
01:18:32,130 --> 01:18:34,450
Oh how cute, does anyone else want to say Jack?

1319
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:39,840
There's a whole line of dialogue here that can't be subtitled, sorry

1320
01:18:39,870 --> 01:18:41,570
That's great

1321
01:18:41,610 --> 01:18:43,440
It's just a hallway

1322
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:47,930
Welcome to the spider community

1323
01:18:57,010 --> 01:18:58,470
A lot, right?

1324
01:18:58,590 --> 01:19:01,270
What happened to that task force you mentioned?

1325
01:19:01,290 --> 01:19:02,960
Many of these are part  -time

1326
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,720
Gwen, how much did you tell her about that story?

1327
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:08,200
About the place as a whole here?

1328
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:09,290
The first

1329
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,220
Maybe you didn't say enough

1330
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:13,370
come over

1331
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:15,300
Bracelet for me!

1332
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:16,620
For temporary travel only

1333
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:20,300
It just stops you from being that way

1334
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:23,720
Hi Gwen   -Hi Peter   -

1335
01:19:24,230 --> 01:19:25,100
hi i want

1336
01:19:25,130 --> 01:19:26,110
Hi Gwen, One ​​of Spiderman's versions of "bag man" (wears a Fantastic Four outfit with a paper bag over his head

1337
01:19:26,130 --> 01:19:28,440
Hi Peters, I'm a new member

1338
01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:32,010
Peter, take the team to the transport station to help collect this terrible place.

1339
01:19:32,690 --> 01:19:34,410
I wouldn't call it terrible

1340
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:36,370
More like continued success

1341
01:19:36,390 --> 01:19:37,210
Ben, I need you

1342
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:39,210
Sorry, I can't talk right now(Ben Riley/Scarlet Spider Earth  -94)

1343
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:40,990
I think about my past

1344
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:42,860
We really need you here for some reason

1345
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,280
It was a particularly heartbreaking

1346
01:19:46,310 --> 01:19:47,420
reminder of the way he was

1347
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:50,000
Hi, my name is Tarkesh.  >

1348
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:51,870
Why does the horse wear a mask?

1349
01:19:52,170 --> 01:19:53,520
to cover his face

1350
01:19:53,870 --> 01:19:55,180
!Let's go

1351
01:19:56,830 --> 01:19:58,710
Who is in this laser cage?

1352
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:01,070
Anomalies are those that are the wrong size

1353
01:20:01,090 --> 01:20:02,840
We serve their mouths and send them to their blood

1354
01:20:02,870 --> 01:20:04,270
Not very interesting   -what?    -

1355
01:20:04,330 --> 01:20:06,160
We have lots of Doctor Octopus   -oh my gosh   -

1356
01:20:06,190 --> 01:20:07,470
A mistery

1357
01:20:07,490 --> 01:20:08,570
And other mysteries

1358
01:20:08,890 --> 01:20:10,690
Gamers   -I love games   -

1359
01:20:10,710 --> 01:20:12,050
Others in the game(Spider-Man Insomniac Company  -1048)

1360
01:20:12,070 --> 01:20:14,300
You're talking to me the font

1361
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,340
Go to hell Spiderman

1362
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,450
How insolent   -what a strange pencil   -

1363
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,120
Boring Rhino

1364
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:22,000
Thief?    -

1365
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:23,970
Prowler is not your Donald Glover as Aaron Davis in the world) (Tom Holland's Spider-Man. That's Prowler right there

1366
01:20:24,090 --> 01:20:25,270
Hi

1367
01:20:26,180 --> 01:20:27,200
Hi

1368
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:31,620
The look is rude

1369
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,130
I brought you here   -I made a mistake   -

1370
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:34,950
what do you do i do everything

1371
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,520
How many missions have you done together?   -

1372
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:38,150
Not much   -twenty or thirty   -

1373
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:39,100
So cool

1374
01:20:39,590 --> 01:20:40,670
Excuse me

1375
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:42,780
Margo Cass aka Spider Bite Earth  -22191

1376
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:43,850
i am spider man

1377
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:45,660
Not my son?  All of us

1378
01:20:45,730 --> 01:20:47,270
Can we continue our journey?

1379
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:50,610
What are you?    -I profiles   -

1380
01:20:50,710 --> 01:20:55,100
My body is next to my parents, I'm sitting on the chair eating Fritos

1381
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:58,330
It's better here

1382
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:00,020
Yes I understand

1383
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:03,520
what is he doing

1384
01:21:03,550 --> 01:21:04,910
He has a very cute name

1385
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:07,110
Bring home the device I said

1386
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:08,420
I am against this name

1387
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:12,340
DNIT will detect it from any dimension and send you there(this guy is a version of Rhinoceros)

1388
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:15,210
*

1389
01:21:20,630 --> 01:21:21,630
We better go

1390
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:23,050
See you later   -don't you like keeping Miguel waiting   -

1391
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:24,000
!Let's go

1392
01:21:24,030 --> 01:21:25,480
Hey, good luck

1393
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:26,320
!Good see you

1394
01:21:26,350 --> 01:21:27,560
Miguel looks angry

1395
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:30,020
He likes empanadas from the buffet

1396
01:21:30,150 --> 01:21:31,630
Don't ask him why

1397
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:35,270
My name is Miguel O'Harast

1398
01:21:37,010 --> 01:21:40,050
I'm the only Spiderman in this dimension

1399
01:21:42,020 --> 01:21:43,530
At least it is

1400
01:21:46,850 --> 01:21:48,740
But I'm not like the others

1401
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:53,480
I don't always like what I have to do

1402
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:56,720
But I knew I had to be the one to do it

1403
01:21:57,990 --> 01:22:00,990
I have lost so much that I want to quit my job now

1404
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:04,910
Oh no

1405
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:07,280
I'm sure it won't do anything

1406
01:22:07,310 --> 01:22:09,810
Maybe he will before you hit him into the wall

1407
01:22:09,830 --> 01:22:11,350
Da'wah, man

1408
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:13,380
It distracts you from the truth

1409
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:14,900
And what is the truth?

1410
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:16,410
I'm not from Brobach Scooby Doo, a punch(Scooby Doo is a term for having ideas and clues)

1411
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:18,220
Because that's what they want

1412
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:24,420
Why do you want to be part of it?

1413
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:25,890
to get a bracelet

1414
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,590
A bracelet for you?

1415
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:29,680
But you don't have a cool device?

1416
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:31,480
you have good parents   -not bad   -

1417
01:22:31,830 --> 01:22:37,100
I mean, we fight, but they want what's best for me

1418
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:38,650
It's so embarrassing

1419
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:40,090
Why?

1420
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:42,980
Because you're not ready for someone else

1421
01:22:55,090 --> 01:22:56,400
listen to me brother

1422
01:22:57,030 --> 01:22:58,970
The point of being Spiderman is to be independent stay

1423
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,960
alone you don't need these things if you are your own boss

1424
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:02,470
so why are you here

1425
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:04,320
Looking for female drama, this is it

1426
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:05,790
all i want to be in a band

1427
01:23:05,820 --> 01:23:09,610
I want to see my friend and for that I need a bracelet

1428
01:23:09,850 --> 01:23:13,600
Don't move guys ok give up

1429
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:16,660
Don't sign up, you know what kind of fight we're in

1430
01:23:39,490 --> 01:23:43,620
Yes, I know it drops very slowly, but it works

1431
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:48,040
Meet Miguel O'Hara and Miles Morales

1432
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:50,250
Hello how are you?

1433
01:23:50,590 --> 01:23:52,240
I speak spanish

1434
01:23:52,930 --> 01:23:55,690
I brought you empanadas

1435
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:57,460
That's great

1436
01:24:01,010 --> 01:24:03,340
Look, I'm excited to get started.  Oh good.

1437
01:24:03,370 --> 01:24:05,440
I have some crazy ideas about how to catch Spot

1438
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:07,290
He just wants to be taken seriously

1439
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:10,540
He is worried about Spate.

1440
01:24:10,590 --> 01:24:12,040
I'll worry about Spot

1441
01:24:12,070 --> 01:24:14,820
what did I do   -Miguel, it's not his fault   -

1442
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:15,960
error?  Let's see you make

1443
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:17,510
another hole in the multiverse

1444
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:18,780
He knows nothing

1445
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:22,750
Of course you do... Well, what don't I know?   -But you know, Gwen...

1446
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:26,320
And you... I want to ignore you

1447
01:24:26,350 --> 01:24:28,460
But I can't... I can't   -I'm not on the team at all

1448
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:30,960
Maybe I what happened

1449
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:32,680
Hey Miguel

1450
01:24:32,710 --> 01:24:35,260
Don't be hard on the kids.

1451
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:37,600
He has a bad coach.

1452
01:24:38,850 --> 01:24:40,230
He didn't stand a chance.

1453
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:41,070
Peter   -Peter

1454
01:24:41,090 --> 01:24:44,750
God, this is the humble Spider-Man

1455
01:24:44,770 --> 01:24:46,150
Miles

1456
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:47,650
Fear not, friend Miguel

1457
01:24:47,670 --> 01:24:48,670
It just looks scary

1458
01:24:48,690 --> 01:24:49,810
But don't bite

1459
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:50,740
Peter

1460
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:52,350
Look how tall you look, look

1461
01:24:52,370 --> 01:24:54,640
at your legs too, you know?

1462
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:55,970
It depends on what you mean

1463
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:57,100
by the way what happened?

1464
01:24:57,130 --> 01:24:58,070
Are your armpits bleeding?

1465
01:24:58,090 --> 01:24:59,730
Peter   -don't worry about his clothes   -

1466
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:00,870
We will buy you new clothes

1467
01:25:00,890 --> 01:25:04,070
PETER you have to tell him... what is it?

1468
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:05,200
you give

1469
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:06,690
Do you have kids?  Yes I have.

1470
01:25:06,710 --> 01:25:07,680
My wool

1471
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:09,960
Be careful dear, your temporary bracelet is not lost

1472
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:12,710
You have one too.  I didn't know they made it for adults too

1473
01:25:12,910 --> 01:25:14,340
Just give me a second!

1474
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:15,940
This kid is a true anarchist(anarchist means someone who likes to riot)

1475
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:18,990
I will eat you now

1476
01:25:19,970 --> 01:25:21,090
I caught you

1477
01:25:21,370 --> 01:25:23,670
I know I'll regret making a web shooter for it

1478
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:25,840
I shouldn't have done that, it's totally wrong

1479
01:25:26,930 --> 01:25:28,690
Hey, do you want to see the picture?   -I said he was here   -

1480
01:25:28,710 --> 01:25:30,470
Look at this picture   -Oh, you took a picture   -

1481
01:25:30,490 --> 01:25:31,370
Oh, this

1482
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:32,440
He is amazing

1483
01:25:32,470 --> 01:25:33,660
Yes   -that's a ridiculous look   -

1484
01:25:33,690 --> 01:25:34,350
hahaha

1485
01:25:34,350 --> 01:25:35,510
Here, for example, he is angry

1486
01:25:35,550 --> 01:25:37,330
It also has the appearance of a workhorse

1487
01:25:37,350 --> 01:25:39,150
Be careful, you will laugh when you

1488
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:40,120
see the next one you will laugh out loud

1489
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:41,260
Oh, Miguel is dying

1490
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:43,400
Miguel, look at this I'm trying

1491
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:45,420
to have a serious conversation with adults

1492
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:47,240
You know, you're the only Spider-Man who isn't funny

1493
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:48,600
you should be nice

1494
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:49,960
The Fate of the Multiverse

1495
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:51,400
You always bore me with these lines, you say

1496
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:55,730
the destiny of the Multiverse and my brain says so

1497
01:25:57,140 --> 01:25:59,010
Did you hear that too? must have sabotaged

1498
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:00,590
Yes, he's a parker too

1499
01:26:00,610 --> 01:26:03,730
Miles, you ruined a big event

1500
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,740
The main event?   -The child does not think   -

1501
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:07,450
It does not work that way

1502
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:08,580
It's insulting that you did such a

1503
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,950
bad job at the unit, I'll applaud you

1504
01:26:10,970 --> 01:26:12,680
Vaisa, why are you angry?

1505
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:14,120
I saved those people

1506
01:26:14,150 --> 01:26:15,810
And security issues

1507
01:26:17,150 --> 01:26:18,970
Layla, do it

1508
01:26:18,990 --> 01:26:20,260
Inn?  which job

1509
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:21,320
What job do you mean?

1510
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:23,160
It is the job of explaining information

1511
01:26:23,190 --> 01:26:24,320
GOOD

1512
01:26:30,670 --> 01:26:32,050
What is this?

1513
01:26:32,860 --> 01:26:35,450
Only this

1514
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:41,110
(very similar to the sacred timeline in the Loki series)

1515
01:26:41,130 --> 01:26:42,850
Can you be more specific?

1516
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:45,070
Can't you talk for a second?

1517
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:46,350
Yes Yes

1518
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:51,280
What you see is all of us

1519
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:58,230
Our entire life is woven into a beautiful web of life and destiny

1520
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:01,340
spiderverse spiderverse?

1521
01:27:01,810 --> 01:27:04,190
It's a stupid name

1522
01:27:04,890 --> 01:27:07,550
This is called the arachno  -humanoid multiverse

1523
01:27:08,370 --> 01:27:11,340
I think that sounds stupid

1524
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:15,880
And are these nodes where the lines meet?

1525
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:17,630
They are the main event

1526
01:27:17,890 --> 01:27:22,480
Part of the ever  -present Spider-Man  -Han story(That's right, the famous kiss scene between Peter and MJ)

1527
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:24,680
Some of them are good

1528
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:26,850
Some bad (poison)

1529
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:30,680
Some of them are pretty bad

1530
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:39,660
go ahead

1531
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:41,380
uncle aaron

1532
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,240
This, the Amazing Spider-Man show from the 90s.

1533
01:27:45,670 --> 01:27:47,690
The police captain who is an acquaintance of Spider-Man

1534
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:52,240
In the fight between Spider-Man and his bloody nemesis, he dies saving a child from under a collapsing wall

1535
01:27:53,090 --> 01:27:54,550
Captain, Stacy

1536
01:27:55,550 --> 01:27:57,120
I apologize

1537
01:28:07,820 --> 01:28:14,910
(Amazing Spider-Man Movie Event 1)

1538
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:21,930
Does this happen to you too?

1539
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:25,360
For me too

1540
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:30,660
Keep going?

1541
01:28:31,050 --> 01:28:33,780
The story is destined to go like this

1542
01:28:34,630 --> 01:28:39,590
The main events that connect our lives

1543
01:28:39,770 --> 01:28:42,320
But the connection may drop

1544
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:47,930
This is why anomalies are so dangerous

1545
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:51,750
Inspector Singh's death was a big event, wasn't it

1546
01:28:51,770 --> 01:28:56,530
you should have been there and you shouldn't have saved him

1547
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,780
That's why Gwen tried to stop you

1548
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,020
Miles, I thought you

1549
01:29:00,050 --> 01:29:02,110
were trying to save me

1550
01:29:03,650 --> 01:29:04,710
tried

1551
01:29:04,750 --> 01:29:08,190
I... I'm having a wedding

1552
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:13,340
And now, Miles, since you changed the story,

1553
01:29:13,460 --> 01:29:16,110
Then Pravitra collapsed

1554
01:29:16,750 --> 01:29:18,190
... if we're lucky

1555
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:19,600
We can prevent it

1556
01:29:21,110 --> 01:29:22,690
We are not always lucky

1557
01:29:22,710 --> 01:29:25,120
That's none of my business...that's Spot's business

1558
01:29:25,150 --> 01:29:27,860
This is what happens when you destroy the main event

1559
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:31,590
how do you know?

1560
01:29:32,110 --> 01:29:34,450
Because I ruined it once

1561
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:38,410
I found another world where I have a family

1562
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:40,430
Where I am happy

1563
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:43,360
At least a version I like

1564
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:44,530
my bag

1565
01:29:44,550 --> 01:29:47,400
And that version of me was killed

1566
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:54,640
So I replaced it

1567
01:29:57,210 --> 01:29:59,210
I guess it's harmless

1568
01:30:02,740 --> 01:30:04,070
But I was wrong

1569
01:30:13,970 --> 01:30:16,180
Father, please help

1570
01:30:21,140 --> 01:30:22,700
Am I right Peter?

1571
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:24,850
Yes

1572
01:30:25,550 --> 01:30:28,780
If we disrupt the main event enough... and save the captains' lives

1573
01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:33,290
We might lose everything

1574
01:30:44,610 --> 01:30:46,670
My father will soon be a captain

1575
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:01,760
I want to take what you have and what you don't have

1576
01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:06,480
I came as if you would take everything away from me   -

1577
01:31:10,630 --> 01:31:12,260
Rear wheel

1578
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:15,670
He will kill my father

1579
01:31:21,620 --> 01:31:23,850
When it happened

1580
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:29,570
when it happens in two days

1581
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:31,990
When he took his oath

1582
01:31:33,050 --> 01:31:34,930
Of course, that's what the algorithm says

1583
01:31:37,110 --> 01:31:38,290
I am sorry that

1584
01:31:38,370 --> 01:31:39,710
Miles sends me home

1585
01:31:40,150 --> 01:31:41,460
I cant do this

1586
01:31:41,490 --> 01:31:42,960
At least not now

1587
01:31:42,990 --> 01:31:44,170
What do you say I should do?

1588
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:45,570
Should I let him die like this?

1589
01:31:49,690 --> 01:31:51,270
But about your father

1590
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:52,860
He's also the captain, right?

1591
01:31:55,170 --> 01:31:56,380
Yes

1592
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:59,560
You won't do anything about it

1593
01:32:02,690 --> 01:32:04,420
All right, Uncle Ben, what?

1594
01:32:04,450 --> 01:32:08,620
It won't be a problem if you know and let it happen

1595
01:32:09,150 --> 01:32:14,620
Many of us wouldn't be here if this hadn't happened to Uncle Ben, Miles

1596
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:20,760
And all these good things we do will never happen.

1597
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:28,820
So we have to let people die at the words of a bunch of algorithms?   -...Good   -

1598
01:32:28,990 --> 01:32:31,860
You do realize how long this is, right?

1599
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:36,640
Between a person and a

1600
01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:37,690
world, you have to save any world

1601
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:38,820
I can choose a partner

1602
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:40,120
...Spiderman, always

1603
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:41,860
Not always

1604
01:32:45,090 --> 01:32:48,440
Miles, we all want to live the life we've always dreamed of

1605
01:32:48,910 --> 01:32:51,420
Trust me, I tried

1606
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:55,250
And the more I try, the more I hurt myself

1607
01:32:56,870 --> 01:32:58,900
You can't have it all, honey

1608
01:33:02,870 --> 01:33:05,600
To be Spider-Man you have to make sacrifices

1609
01:33:05,620 --> 01:33:07,100
This is our job

1610
01:33:07,510 --> 01:33:09,150
When you become Spiderman, you accept it

1611
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:10,930
Miles

1612
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:14,560
Annie?

1613
01:33:16,110 --> 01:33:17,320
What happens?

1614
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:20,580
can you all calm me down

1615
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:22,500
We know it's hard

1616
01:33:23,830 --> 01:33:25,280
But actually Miles (The Spectacular Spider-Man)

1617
01:33:25,870 --> 01:33:27,310
Is that why you're here?

1618
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,490
that I could easily care?

1619
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:33,970
It worked last time, why not try again, right?

1620
01:33:33,990 --> 01:33:35,110
Wait wait

1621
01:33:35,140 --> 01:33:36,390
You're right, Gwen

1622
01:33:36,750 --> 01:33:38,620
You shouldn't have come to meet me at all

1623
01:33:38,810 --> 01:33:40,800
Honey, look at me   -don't say honey

1624
01:33:40,820 --> 01:33:42,470
It began   -Husband, your words do not help   -

1625
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:43,610
It is so good

1626
01:33:43,740 --> 01:33:44,940
Miles, please understand that I don't

1627
01:33:44,970 --> 01:33:47,180
you can ask me not to save my father

1628
01:33:47,490 --> 01:33:48,760
Not a request

1629
01:33:49,230 --> 01:33:50,650
Wait a moment

1630
01:33:51,070 --> 01:33:52,010
Stop

1631
01:33:52,730 --> 01:33:53,770
Stop

1632
01:33:54,180 --> 01:33:56,090
If we let it, it will hurt us more, you know

1633
01:33:56,230 --> 01:33:57,540
both that it doesn't end well   -end   -

1634
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:00,310
You will only be here for a few days

1635
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:02,320
I don't want that to happen, son

1636
01:34:02,950 --> 01:34:05,540
I said don't say honey

1637
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:18,890
Miles

1638
01:34:19,790 --> 01:34:21,930
Well, I'm sorry I did that

1639
01:34:21,940 --> 01:34:23,340
Good parents don't do that

1640
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:26,510
As soon as I know, I will fix the problem

1641
01:34:31,220 --> 01:34:34,760
Drop all units no matter what you do and stop Spider-Man

1642
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:36,910
do you mean   -Wait, with you?    -

1643
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:37,850
with me

1644
01:34:37,870 --> 01:34:38,850
I?    -Me?    -

1645
01:34:38,870 --> 01:34:40,010
I'm spitting on you, Miles

1646
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:41,000
Miles Morales

1647
01:34:41,020 --> 01:34:42,500
He entered zone 4

1648
01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:47,380
The mirror?

1649
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:49,990
huh?  Does tar stick to my face? What is the problem

1650
01:34:50,020 --> 01:34:51,830
Miles and miles!

1651
01:34:51,850 --> 01:34:53,150
It's right back there

1652
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:54,660
Hey boss, what's all the fuss about?

1653
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:15,570
Is that weird?

1654
01:35:18,390 --> 01:35:19,750
I think it is possible

1655
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:27,930
Excuse me

1656
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:35,040
I see the audience and that

1657
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:37,030
Let me guess, dead?

1658
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:51,270
In the number of three, we shoot

1659
01:35:51,290 --> 01:35:53,230
One I didn't say three

1660
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:55,710
can you take our picture

1661
01:35:55,740 --> 01:35:57,010
This is the first follow up

1662
01:35:57,790 --> 01:35:59,270
Get me out of this mess

1663
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:06,730
Miles?    -Hello, write   -

1664
01:36:07,370 --> 01:36:10,000
I'm a big fan   -thanks   -

1665
01:36:10,030 --> 01:36:12,870
Don't you think humor is like a stick for Spiderman?

1666
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:14,810
you got?  sugar cane

1667
01:36:15,620 --> 01:36:17,310
Anything He Could Do, I Can(Spiderman Animation 1981)

1668
01:36:17,330 --> 01:36:19,060
Hey, I think I have a stretch somewhere in my body

1669
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:29,140
Hi Peter (Alfred Molina's dialogue as Doctor Octopus in New Way Home)

1670
01:36:45,210 --> 01:36:46,940
What is it?    -No way out   -

1671
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:55,880
It's my fault, guys

1672
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:57,170
It's like an exit

1673
01:37:06,150 --> 01:37:07,350
No Trespassing

1674
01:37:07,370 --> 01:37:09,270
So don't follow me

1675
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:11,250
you confused me again

1676
01:37:11,770 --> 01:37:15,100
I know he's your friend, but it's the only way

1677
01:37:15,130 --> 01:37:17,380
But Hashem told me this   -so use that word   -

1678
01:37:36,410 --> 01:37:38,140
This is called ventilatory sleep

1679
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:40,150
I use my hands to hug you

1680
01:38:00,910 --> 01:38:01,910
Miles

1681
01:38:02,290 --> 01:38:03,390
No, no... let me go

1682
01:38:03,410 --> 01:38:04,860
Running away is madness

1683
01:38:04,890 --> 01:38:07,500
Either way, running away was the most rational thing to do

1684
01:38:07,530 --> 01:38:09,040
I do not feel well

1685
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:09,940
It is so good

1686
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:13,150
But the situation is the same, you won't win this time

1687
01:38:13,350 --> 01:38:14,210
I can't reach you   -no, no   -

1688
01:38:14,230 --> 01:38:16,020
moving so fast

1689
01:38:16,230 --> 01:38:16,890
NOT

1690
01:38:16,910 --> 01:38:18,460
Do you want to hug my baby?

1691
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:19,230
What the

1692
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:22,650
Hold the baby once, we'll talk about it later, it'll change your mind.

1693
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:23,290
!NOT

1694
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:24,490
It brings energy to a person

1695
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:25,700
that they are quite good at

1696
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:29,510
When you hug this miracle baby chest to chest, you will feel better

1697
01:38:29,540 --> 01:38:31,710
Now you don't have to speak to me from the heart

1698
01:38:31,730 --> 01:38:34,260
Take the baby, then we'll see what happens

1699
01:38:35,860 --> 01:38:38,090
you are the reason, right?

1700
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:40,640
... I thought

1701
01:38:40,930 --> 01:38:46,850
If they raise him right, there's a chance he'll turn out to be just like you

1702
01:38:47,030 --> 01:38:50,460
And that makes me happy because you are a very funny person

1703
01:38:50,900 --> 01:38:52,910
And I love traveling with you

1704
01:38:54,290 --> 01:38:56,170
So why don't you come see me?

1705
01:38:57,240 --> 01:38:58,320
...Because

1706
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:00,800
I can not

1707
01:39:01,470 --> 01:39:03,680
I really want to be with you

1708
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:08,550
But that's not what I thought

1709
01:39:08,610 --> 01:39:09,620
...See

1710
01:39:09,970 --> 01:39:12,410
Bad things happen either intentionally or unintentionally

1711
01:39:12,490 --> 01:39:14,850
They make us who we are

1712
01:39:15,650 --> 01:39:18,530
And good things happen beside him, you know?

1713
01:39:19,410 --> 01:39:21,230
Like your existence

1714
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:24,410
And where is this girl

1715
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:26,110
Hi!

1716
01:39:26,130 --> 01:39:27,690
I don't want to... listen

1717
01:39:27,710 --> 01:39:31,190
And you are very stupid to hug a child

1718
01:39:31,210 --> 01:39:33,800
That's your position, Peter. Done   -wait, wait, no   -

1719
01:39:33,830 --> 01:39:35,930
you don't have my position.  whole

1720
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:37,280
Send to everyone

1721
01:39:38,470 --> 01:39:41,650
No, no, Miles, I don't know, I promise

1722
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,660
Please, mate, let's talk about it

1723
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:44,910
we speak

1724
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:48,500
It's a good discussion

1725
01:39:52,790 --> 01:39:53,770
is here

1726
01:40:06,620 --> 01:40:07,640
Miles

1727
01:40:07,830 --> 01:40:08,780
Where do you think this will go?

1728
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:10,750
I don't think he has a plan

1729
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:14,630
If I haven't told you by now, you're a terrible coach

1730
01:40:23,540 --> 01:40:25,250
He just beat you

1731
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:27,050
So I'm not a bad coach

1732
01:40:27,070 --> 01:40:29,530
You two are awful, aren't you?

1733
01:40:31,210 --> 01:40:33,360
Stop pretending you don't know

1734
01:40:33,380 --> 01:40:34,360
what you're doing, I have a plan

1735
01:40:34,710 --> 01:40:37,070
I just... haven't told you yet

1736
01:40:52,570 --> 01:40:53,960
*

1737
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:55,210
It's not good

1738
01:41:13,540 --> 01:41:14,840
they are claws

1739
01:41:14,860 --> 01:41:16,830
Dude, are you sure you're Spiderman?

1740
01:41:17,890 --> 01:41:21,170
Who do you think You Are?

1741
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:27,270
My name is Miles Morales

1742
01:41:32,780 --> 01:41:35,440
A radioactive spider bit me

1743
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:40,280
And I'm sure you know the rest of the story yourself

1744
01:41:49,350 --> 01:41:50,610
how are you buddy

1745
01:41:52,340 --> 01:41:54,720
I don't understand that you are an anomaly

1746
01:41:54,750 --> 01:41:57,000
Not if you let me go home

1747
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:01,540
seller

1748
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:06,040
you are an anomaly wherever you go

1749
01:42:13,590 --> 01:42:16,340
basically you are an anomaly

1750
01:42:19,970 --> 01:42:21,020
Miguel!

1751
01:42:21,750 --> 01:42:25,750
The spider that gave you power is not yours

1752
01:42:27,380 --> 01:42:29,330
It shouldn't bite at all

1753
01:42:30,150 --> 01:42:31,080
Miguel, don't do this

1754
01:42:31,110 --> 01:42:35,800
There is a world where there is no Spider-Man to protect it, because Spider-Man bit you.

1755
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:37,880
You weren't meant to be Spider-Man

1756
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:40,330
!NOT!  Lying!  Are

1757
01:42:40,350 --> 01:42:41,560
Spiderman, you are wrong

1758
01:42:43,820 --> 01:42:47,090
If Peter Parker hadn't bitten you, your world would have lived on

1759
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:49,920
Instead, he died saving you

1760
01:42:50,750 --> 01:42:53,380
He will stop the device between worlds before things go wrong

1761
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:54,900
There is no room

1762
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,990
And none of these things happened

1763
01:42:58,170 --> 01:43:02,540
And all this time, I was the only one who maintained everything…

1764
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:04,350
Miguel, don't be hard on

1765
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:06,310
him, you don't belong here

1766
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:07,840
you were never part of it

1767
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:09,460
Let me alone

1768
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:10,440
Miguel is fed up

1769
01:43:10,460 --> 01:43:12,320
That's not what we're talking about

1770
01:43:13,310 --> 01:43:14,930
are you talking about this?

1771
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:18,200
Know

1772
01:43:19,010 --> 01:43:21,850
Do you all know?

1773
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:24,040
...I do not know

1774
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:26,000
How can I tell you?

1775
01:43:27,490 --> 01:43:29,570
That's why you never came to see me

1776
01:43:33,270 --> 01:43:35,140
Miles, this is for your own good

1777
01:43:35,180 --> 01:43:36,560
Who determines my goodness?

1778
01:43:37,110 --> 01:43:38,520
I'm not a child, Gwen

1779
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:40,760
You are perfectly right!

1780
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:42,300
Just a child!

1781
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:46,010
He didn't know what he was doing at all

1782
01:43:51,540 --> 01:43:52,610
OK

1783
01:43:52,680 --> 01:43:56,590
I dragged hundreds of people from your spider community here with me

1784
01:44:02,460 --> 01:44:04,380
I think he has a plan

1785
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:08,660
And I want to do it

1786
01:44:13,670 --> 01:44:18,090
Everyone is always telling me how my story is going to turn out

1787
01:44:18,810 --> 01:44:21,480
No, I'm doing my job

1788
01:44:21,990 --> 01:44:23,160
Shame on you, Miguel

1789
01:44:23,430 --> 01:44:24,760
I'm home

1790
01:44:41,060 --> 01:44:42,380
Goodbye, Gwen

1791
01:44:45,780 --> 01:44:46,840
Miles

1792
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:53,140
I taught him how to do it

1793
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:55,730
So I must be a good coach, I did

1794
01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:07,530
NOT

1795
01:45:07,620 --> 01:45:08,690
NOT

1796
01:45:08,940 --> 01:45:10,980
This is not good at all

1797
01:45:10,980 --> 01:45:12,440
Oh no, not at all

1798
01:45:12,470 --> 01:45:13,500
I was like that.

1799
01:45:13,530 --> 01:45:14,800
But not now

1800
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:16,340
Inn?

1801
01:45:35,350 --> 01:45:36,220
Inn?

1802
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,470
Turn on the device, take it home

1803
01:45:52,350 --> 01:45:54,610
Next sign detected Target DNA detected) (Earth  -42 DNA

1804
01:46:04,700 --> 01:46:05,600
move one

1805
01:46:05,630 --> 01:46:06,400
No no

1806
01:46:06,580 --> 01:46:07,320
!NOT

1807
01:46:07,340 --> 01:46:09,040
!no no no

1808
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:16,670
What happened

1809
01:46:16,700 --> 01:46:18,420
The device is activated automatically

1810
01:46:18,440 --> 01:46:19,890
How is that possible?   -Not

1811
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:21,360
Impossible

1812
01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:29,190
What do you say about this?   -No no no!

1813
01:46:29,220 --> 01:46:30,880
Wait, now what?   -You are hands and feet.

1814
01:46:48,630 --> 01:46:49,470
Step in front of her

1815
01:46:49,470 --> 01:46:50,430
Now!

1816
01:46:50,660 --> 01:46:52,680
What do you think I'm doing now?

1817
01:47:01,380 --> 01:47:02,640
Do something!

1818
01:47:03,110 --> 01:47:03,990
!NOT

1819
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:07,720
Miguel!

1820
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:08,840
Stop

1821
01:47:27,580 --> 01:47:28,970
Start rebooting the system

1822
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:37,590
!NOT

1823
01:47:51,470 --> 01:47:52,740
Okay, that's enough

1824
01:47:52,760 --> 01:47:54,080
This is not a device malfunction

1825
01:47:54,110 --> 01:47:56,370
All you have to do is listen to me

1826
01:47:57,110 --> 01:47:58,110
Why doesn't he listen?

1827
01:47:58,130 --> 01:47:59,570
Maybe because you didn't take it hard enough

1828
01:47:59,620 --> 01:48:00,620
Gwen, don't

1829
01:48:00,620 --> 01:48:01,780
this, let him go

1830
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:03,320
I?    -you don't understand, Gwen   -

1831
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:05,050
Okay, let's all take a deep breath

1832
01:48:05,050 --> 01:48:06,620
Peter, do you want to defend me?

1833
01:48:06,650 --> 01:48:07,440
Good

1834
01:48:07,470 --> 01:48:12,490
Miguel, as a father to a daughter and a son to a mother   -yes, you better stop talking   -

1835
01:48:12,490 --> 01:48:13,480
Ok, I understand

1836
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:14,710
let me talk to him

1837
01:48:16,510 --> 01:48:18,430
I tried this, he is my friend

1838
01:48:18,430 --> 01:48:19,650
Yes, and that's the problem

1839
01:48:19,650 --> 01:48:22,810
Are you sure what would happen if the main event broke?

1840
01:48:23,900 --> 01:48:25,420
Do you want to understand?

1841
01:48:25,830 --> 01:48:27,830
I told you it was trouble

1842
01:48:28,990 --> 01:48:30,130
You are wrong

1843
01:48:30,660 --> 01:48:32,810
Jess, tell him he's wrong

1844
01:48:34,410 --> 01:48:35,430
He was not wrong

1845
01:48:35,660 --> 01:48:37,070
you are serious now

1846
01:48:37,430 --> 01:48:41,210
,I told.  If you let go, I can't help you anymore

1847
01:48:42,030 --> 01:48:43,320
I won't go with you

1848
01:48:43,590 --> 01:48:44,590
You are right

1849
01:48:45,090 --> 01:48:46,180
What the

1850
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:48,460
What's wrong with you?

1851
01:48:58,470 --> 01:48:59,780
Go home, Gwen

1852
01:49:05,390 --> 01:49:07,870
For example, we should be good people

1853
01:49:23,950 --> 01:49:25,020
It is

1854
01:49:28,430 --> 01:49:29,450
We are good people

1855
01:49:31,260 --> 01:49:33,200
Jess, Ben, come with me

1856
01:49:33,460 --> 01:49:34,490
Of course

1857
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:36,050
Someone took the place

1858
01:49:36,350 --> 01:49:37,250
Yes, it's a shame I have

1859
01:49:37,250 --> 01:49:39,190
to put the baby to sleep

1860
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:40,310
not you

1861
01:49:40,420 --> 01:49:41,890
I'm tired of you

1862
01:50:34,710 --> 01:50:35,810
how it works

1863
01:50:36,630 --> 01:50:37,750
I do not know

1864
01:50:38,060 --> 01:50:41,520
Peter, are you making our kids fight again?

1865
01:50:41,640 --> 01:50:42,490
... bring us the son

1866
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:43,620
our no no no

1867
01:50:43,930 --> 01:50:45,010
Because you asked me not to

1868
01:50:45,130 --> 01:50:45,900
So that's why I don't have it

1869
01:50:45,930 --> 01:50:46,850
did it, I won't do it

1870
01:50:47,710 --> 01:50:50,070
Access is not possible

1871
01:51:18,710 --> 01:51:20,350
Do you think I will be a good father?

1872
01:51:21,910 --> 01:51:23,230
Are you asking this now?

1873
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:28,040
There are no books to raise someone like that

1874
01:51:28,940 --> 01:51:31,850
Or... be yourself

1875
01:51:35,980 --> 01:51:38,860
You just have to make the right decision in the shortest possible time

1876
01:51:43,680 --> 01:51:45,020
Furthermore, this is a metaphor of

1877
01:51:45,050 --> 01:51:46,350
the sport that I made myself

1878
01:51:46,380 --> 01:51:49,220
Too bad, I'm a sports junkie myself and I still don't get it

1879
01:51:49,470 --> 01:51:51,710
I watch sports

1880
01:51:51,730 --> 01:51:53,920
good hero   -awesome   -

1881
01:52:22,090 --> 01:52:23,700
Would you like to be cuter with Mr. Penguin?

1882
01:52:24,390 --> 01:52:27,970
You can...don't even look at me

1883
01:52:30,390 --> 01:52:31,440
What the?

1884
01:52:31,470 --> 01:52:32,840
What else is this?

1885
01:52:33,570 --> 01:52:36,300
I see you the way you want

1886
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:40,120
you are skin and bones

1887
01:52:41,250 --> 01:52:42,520
where are you?

1888
01:52:42,660 --> 01:52:45,600
I'm there to kill all my friends

1889
01:52:45,730 --> 01:52:48,690
Oh, it's funny, ok yeah

1890
01:52:48,710 --> 01:52:49,740
Good

1891
01:52:55,210 --> 01:52:57,240
Where are you going?    -I do not know   -

1892
01:53:01,610 --> 01:53:03,740
You're a good cop, Dad

1893
01:53:04,490 --> 01:53:09,200
You know, you wear that police badge because you know that if you don't, someone who shouldn't wear it will.

1894
01:53:10,250 --> 01:53:16,120
But you must understand that this mask is my logo

1895
01:53:16,870 --> 01:53:19,870
And I try to be good

1896
01:53:20,230 --> 01:53:24,950
I tried so hard to wear it the way you want

1897
01:53:25,780 --> 01:53:27,050
And I can not

1898
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:28,940
I can't, I can do many things, but I

1899
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:32,800
can't help the people I love the most

1900
01:53:32,830 --> 01:53:35,370
And I can only know half of my identity

1901
01:53:35,390 --> 01:53:38,630
That's why I'm all alone

1902
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:42,310
And now... I don't even know what's good anymore

1903
01:53:42,330 --> 01:53:45,380
I don't know what to do... but I do

1904
01:53:47,350 --> 01:53:50,150
I can't lose any more friends

1905
01:53:53,180 --> 01:53:54,180
Gwen I taught you

1906
01:53:54,280 --> 01:53:56,800
always follow the rules

1907
01:53:56,820 --> 01:53:58,280
Yes, but where did he go?

1908
01:53:58,300 --> 01:53:59,390
I ate some

1909
01:53:59,420 --> 01:54:01,330
So catch me, daddy

1910
01:54:02,490 --> 01:54:05,580
Solve the case   -I... I can't   -

1911
01:54:05,780 --> 01:54:06,910
Why?

1912
01:54:07,410 --> 01:54:08,980
Because I'm resigning

1913
01:54:10,140 --> 01:54:11,320
When

1914
01:54:12,210 --> 01:54:14,190
Almost in the middle of your big speech

1915
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:17,000
You... I'll see

1916
01:54:17,030 --> 01:54:18,540
Are you not the captain anymore?

1917
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:21,140
... Means

1918
01:54:22,780 --> 01:54:28,930
My job, being a captain, all these things don't matter anymore

1919
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:36,180
Raising you was the best thing I ever did

1920
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:53,010
It's a great speech, isn't it?

1921
01:54:53,040 --> 01:54:54,330
No wonder you're 19 in

1922
01:54:54,350 --> 01:54:56,350
English, I'm actually 16

1923
01:54:56,370 --> 01:54:57,840
I didn't go to some classes

1924
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:01,850
I do not know what to do

1925
01:55:03,450 --> 01:55:06,140
But I think it will help you

1926
01:55:08,200 --> 01:55:10,470
The person who gave this to me is a big punch

1927
01:55:13,890 --> 01:55:16,100
As a precaution, if your wristband does not work, Hobby   -

1928
01:55:35,080 --> 01:55:36,140
I will be right back

1929
01:55:38,480 --> 01:55:39,560
I promise

1930
01:55:47,580 --> 01:55:49,980
Being a father is a problem

1931
01:55:51,550 --> 01:55:52,910
Mysterious problem

1932
01:55:59,330 --> 01:56:00,780
You are wrong

1933
01:56:00,810 --> 01:56:04,150
If Peter Parker hadn't bitten you, your world would have lived on

1934
01:56:04,820 --> 01:56:06,740
And none of these things happened

1935
01:56:07,030 --> 01:56:12,170
Miles, the hardest part of our job is that you can't

1936
01:56:12,190 --> 01:56:15,500
save everyone  I'm going to make you pay back everything you took from me

1937
01:56:15,530 --> 01:56:19,440
Between one person and one world,

1938
01:56:19,470 --> 01:56:20,310
you have to save one.  I can do both

1939
01:56:20,340 --> 01:56:21,990
...Spiderman, always

1940
01:56:22,020 --> 01:56:22,940
Not always

1941
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:26,010
Whatever you want to do, don't lose your way

1942
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:27,520
Bad things continue

1943
01:56:27,540 --> 01:56:29,860
I don't know how to tell you that

1944
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:31,760
you shouldn't be spiderman

1945
01:56:34,290 --> 01:56:35,590
Keep it up

1946
01:56:52,820 --> 01:56:54,050
have you checked the situation?

1947
01:56:54,070 --> 01:56:55,520
Yes   -no news about them   -

1948
01:56:55,550 --> 01:56:58,240
Layla, can you send them all? Send them anywhere

1949
01:56:58,270 --> 01:56:59,750
Anywhere I can

1950
01:56:59,850 --> 01:57:00,850
Congratulations, Captain

1951
01:57:00,850 --> 01:57:03,140
Captain, you can't call me Captain Saddam until I swear

1952
01:57:03,160 --> 01:57:03,830
You know that

1953
01:57:03,850 --> 01:57:05,060
We are all proud of you

1954
01:57:33,350 --> 01:57:35,670
Molay's attitude

1955
01:57:36,980 --> 01:57:39,890
There might be some disturbance in the driveway, I'd better check

1956
01:57:40,550 --> 01:57:44,620
Now something unusual is coming my

1957
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:46,880
way.  I look at the walls, they are normal

1958
01:57:46,900 --> 01:57:48,730
... but I'm facing something

1959
01:57:49,710 --> 01:57:50,770
NOT

1960
01:58:10,590 --> 01:58:11,650
I did

1961
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:13,600
my house

1962
01:58:18,570 --> 01:58:19,880
Miles?

1963
01:58:24,940 --> 01:58:26,540
Is now a bad time?

1964
01:58:26,540 --> 01:58:27,470
I'm late?

1965
01:58:27,500 --> 01:58:29,400
what are you doing with your hair are you ok

1966
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:30,650
say you are fine

1967
01:58:31,540 --> 01:58:33,080
I'm fine

1968
01:58:33,080 --> 01:58:34,340
You are right

1969
01:58:34,900 --> 01:58:36,100
you are right about everything

1970
01:58:36,100 --> 01:58:37,870
Obviously, I'm right, I'm always right

1971
01:58:38,200 --> 01:58:39,260
Now what am I right about?

1972
01:58:39,290 --> 01:58:44,240
I've seen a lot of bad places and met a lot of bad people

1973
01:58:44,420 --> 01:58:45,160
But

1974
01:58:45,160 --> 01:58:47,250
what's the problem my dear

1975
01:58:48,530 --> 01:58:50,110
But they don't want me

1976
01:58:51,220 --> 01:58:53,160
I thought about what you said

1977
01:58:54,680 --> 01:58:56,140
I broke it, mom

1978
01:58:57,560 --> 01:58:59,020
I took them all

1979
01:59:02,540 --> 01:59:04,690
Now I know how strong I am

1980
01:59:05,940 --> 01:59:12,810
My strength is because of you, father and me

1981
01:59:15,150 --> 01:59:19,370
Ma'am, something's coming our way

1982
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:21,720
...something

1983
01:59:22,270 --> 01:59:23,410
Something really bad

1984
01:59:23,440 --> 01:59:26,120
Myles, what about you?

1985
01:59:26,150 --> 01:59:27,590
His name is Spates

1986
01:59:28,050 --> 01:59:29,700
He is my enemy.

1987
01:59:30,970 --> 01:59:32,630
And I will stop it

1988
01:59:37,940 --> 01:59:39,870
I know you know I lied to you

1989
01:59:41,290 --> 01:59:46,880
Because I thought that if you knew, you wouldn't love me like you used to

1990
01:59:49,140 --> 01:59:51,070
But then I'm out

1991
01:59:52,340 --> 01:59:57,270
And now... I'm not afraid of anything now

1992
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:01,400
what you want to tell me must

1993
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:03,260
promise me nothing will change

1994
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:04,700
Sugar honey I will always

1995
02:00:04,750 --> 02:00:05,550
love you must promise

1996
02:00:05,580 --> 02:00:06,920
Always

1997
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:08,770
I don't care what you say

1998
02:00:09,690 --> 02:00:11,360
I understand you

1999
02:00:17,720 --> 02:00:18,810
Mother?

2000
02:00:20,830 --> 02:00:21,830
…I

2001
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:25,150
i am spider man

2002
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:37,440
who is spider man

2003
02:00:39,770 --> 02:00:41,360
He is a super hero

2004
02:00:41,730 --> 02:00:43,340
A spider bit him

2005
02:00:44,490 --> 02:00:46,520
It gave him spider powers

2006
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:50,010
this is me

2007
02:00:54,790 --> 02:00:57,290
Did you say you dress up as your favorite character?

2008
02:00:57,290 --> 02:00:59,050
What's that thing called?

2009
02:00:59,050 --> 02:01:00,310
Oh, Comic Con, I

2010
02:01:00,310 --> 02:01:01,710
don't know what that is

2011
02:01:01,710 --> 02:01:04,510
I really thought the news was Spiderman

2012
02:01:04,620 --> 02:01:05,850
What imagination do you have?

2013
02:01:13,470 --> 02:01:14,710
For example, do you have eight hands?

2014
02:01:14,740 --> 02:01:16,980
Do you have silk coming out of your butt?

2015
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:18,640
I've had nightmares like this once before, but no

2016
02:01:18,670 --> 02:01:19,990
Are you sure you woke up after that?

2017
02:01:38,580 --> 02:01:40,300
Mom, enough jokes

2018
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:41,590
Serious talk

2019
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:43,340
Dad works with Spiderman

2020
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:48,270
...he doesn't understand that I'm Spider-Man, but I wish he was here right now to explain

2021
02:01:48,300 --> 02:01:49,790
Miles, please

2022
02:01:53,700 --> 02:01:54,820
I have to pay attention to you

2023
02:01:54,840 --> 02:01:56,440
I have to take care of myself

2024
02:01:56,660 --> 02:01:58,360
So first help me   -Mom, wait, wait   -

2025
02:01:58,390 --> 02:01:59,390
... I need to talk

2026
02:02:05,680 --> 02:02:06,860
Oh no

2027
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:12,820
He was wrong in the world

2028
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:16,680
The spider that bit me

2029
02:02:17,720 --> 02:02:18,860
42

2030
02:02:22,450 --> 02:02:24,020
It's not for me

2031
02:02:24,950 --> 02:02:27,200
The following symptoms are identified

2032
02:02:27,480 --> 02:02:28,890
... that device

2033
02:02:31,180 --> 02:02:32,920
He didn't send me home

2034
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:47,830
Uncle Aaron?

2035
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:50,760
Hi

2036
02:02:58,110 --> 02:03:01,030
Earth  -42

2037
02:03:01,900 --> 02:03:02,900
Are you ok?

2038
02:03:09,670 --> 02:03:11,050
i really miss you

2039
02:03:12,180 --> 02:03:14,330
OK, OK now

2040
02:03:14,350 --> 02:03:15,840
Have you changed your hair style?

2041
02:03:16,780 --> 02:03:18,150
deliberately?    -Yes   -

2042
02:03:18,170 --> 02:03:22,200
Yes, I'm still at peace with it

2043
02:03:22,620 --> 02:03:25,430
At the hospital, they will give me more shifts, so next month, I swear, I will

2044
02:03:25,460 --> 02:03:26,720
Enough, we don't

2045
02:03:26,810 --> 02:03:27,860
need to be family

2046
02:03:28,790 --> 02:03:29,790
Be grateful

2047
02:03:30,470 --> 02:03:31,530
Meanwhile on Earth  -1610

2048
02:03:31,550 --> 02:03:32,910
Hello how are you doing?    -Hello

2049
02:03:33,210 --> 02:03:34,090
How about Miles?

2050
02:03:34,120 --> 02:03:36,760
Well, do you remember telling him he wasn't allowed to go out?

2051
02:03:36,790 --> 02:03:37,790
GOOD?

2052
02:03:37,810 --> 02:03:40,320
I leave what you do

2053
02:03:40,340 --> 02:03:41,510
First of all, of course

2054
02:03:41,920 --> 02:03:45,620
*

2055
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:49,420
Oh Miles, I have to work late tonight

2056
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:50,790
This list bought I'm

2057
02:03:50,820 --> 02:03:52,360
sure he will buy it

2058
02:03:54,070 --> 02:03:55,590
ok come on

2059
02:04:00,240 --> 02:04:01,620
The security key came at six

2060
02:04:01,620 --> 02:04:02,970
Do we still have a chance?

2061
02:04:03,550 --> 02:04:05,040
Yes indeed

2062
02:04:05,900 --> 02:04:10,050
I totally get what you're saying

2063
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,010
Are you ok?

2064
02:04:16,170 --> 02:04:17,440
*

2065
02:04:19,150 --> 02:04:20,400
So come on

2066
02:04:21,130 --> 02:04:22,390
Are you sure you remember the map?

2067
02:04:22,410 --> 02:04:28,670
Yes, but we better start again... as soon as we can

2068
02:04:29,450 --> 02:04:30,670
Does not matter

2069
02:04:38,170 --> 02:04:40,380
This is not Spider-Man

2070
02:04:46,240 --> 02:04:49,870
Captain Jeff Morales, husband, hero, father's soulmate

2071
02:04:50,050 --> 02:04:51,220
...Father

2072
02:05:10,710 --> 02:05:12,250
Sorry, honey, but you

2073
02:05:12,270 --> 02:05:14,160
You gave him this permission unilaterally

2074
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:18,280
I'm just not worried about the Nabob finding friends

2075
02:05:18,310 --> 02:05:20,090
Probably because of the same girl

2076
02:05:20,310 --> 02:05:22,510
What did she think of him being with her?

2077
02:05:22,630 --> 02:05:24,210
I have some ideas

2078
02:05:24,430 --> 02:05:25,950
... baby, you're really no help

2079
02:05:25,970 --> 02:05:28,490
The girl has come this far, Miles' eyes light up

2080
02:05:29,830 --> 02:05:31,650
I just hope the girl isn't upset

2081
02:05:34,580 --> 02:05:36,430
Does that mean these things are my fault too?

2082
02:05:36,430 --> 02:05:37,530
No no

2083
02:05:37,530 --> 02:05:38,650
Maybe this is all my fault

2084
02:05:38,650 --> 02:05:40,850
don't worry honey

2085
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:41,680
you are an amazing

2086
02:05:41,700 --> 02:05:42,820
father it's so hard

2087
02:05:42,820 --> 02:05:48,290
It's like having a new baby that wants to grow up fast

2088
02:05:49,940 --> 02:05:52,100
And maybe we should grow up

2089
02:05:53,610 --> 02:05:54,940
Little bit

2090
02:05:55,110 --> 02:05:58,160
Maybe we should leave it

2091
02:05:58,320 --> 02:05:59,730
take the lid off, Haji Haji?

2092
02:05:59,730 --> 02:06:01,330
It is not your fault

2093
02:06:03,990 --> 02:06:05,010
it's my fault

2094
02:06:05,560 --> 02:06:07,970
Oh, that's okay, what are you doing here?

2095
02:06:07,990 --> 02:06:11,400
Oh, her bedroom window was open... so I came to you

2096
02:06:11,710 --> 02:06:13,150
This is completely normal

2097
02:06:13,170 --> 02:06:14,550
I want to talk to your parents

2098
02:06:14,580 --> 02:06:16,740
Okay, it's hard to communicate with my dad

2099
02:06:16,750 --> 02:06:18,290
Oh really?  What is this

2100
02:06:18,310 --> 02:06:19,400
Storage materials?

2101
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:21,250
police

2102
02:06:23,260 --> 02:06:24,500
I take back what I said

2103
02:06:25,100 --> 02:06:26,240
Yeah, well, I'll call the station, I

2104
02:06:26,260 --> 02:06:29,410
don't think Miles is there or anywhere

2105
02:06:29,410 --> 02:06:31,910
So where is this jacket, Emo Miles?

2106
02:06:31,930 --> 02:06:33,780
I don't know   -don't you know?    -

2107
02:06:33,800 --> 02:06:35,500
Don't know what you want to say?

2108
02:06:35,530 --> 02:06:36,610
I go

2109
02:06:36,630 --> 02:06:38,710
Where do you think you're going, miss?

2110
02:06:39,070 --> 02:06:40,470
i will find it

2111
02:06:41,780 --> 02:06:46,930
I don't know exactly where, but I know where to start

2112
02:06:48,390 --> 02:06:53,690
One thing I learned from Miles is that anything is possible

2113
02:06:56,070 --> 02:06:59,600
He loves you more than you can imagine

2114
02:07:03,510 --> 02:07:04,780
I see what I'm saying

2115
02:07:09,930 --> 02:07:11,360
If you find it

2116
02:07:13,570 --> 02:07:15,650
Tell him he will be punished for five months

2117
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:19,660
And let's just say we love him

2118
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:22,360
Hilaire

2119
02:07:39,270 --> 02:07:41,640
Miles Morales: Spider-Man The Prowler Claw

2120
02:07:56,200 --> 02:07:57,690
Uncle Aaron?

2121
02:08:05,440 --> 02:08:08,420
to my ear well waits

2122
02:08:12,190 --> 02:08:14,400
You don't understand that I don't belong here

2123
02:08:15,260 --> 02:08:17,400
I belong to another dimension

2124
02:08:17,830 --> 02:08:19,030
Vaisa Vaisa Vaisa

2125
02:08:19,060 --> 02:08:20,730
I beg you

2126
02:08:21,070 --> 02:08:22,690
I was sent here by mistake

2127
02:08:22,720 --> 02:08:24,300
Uncle Aaron Vaisa Vaisa

2128
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:25,490
Vaisa Vaisa uncle Aaron

2129
02:08:39,520 --> 02:08:45,010
Please, Uncle Aaron, listen to what I have to say

2130
02:08:48,590 --> 02:08:51,160
A spider bit me and gave me strength

2131
02:08:51,970 --> 02:08:53,710
He shouldn't bite me

2132
02:08:53,730 --> 02:08:55,660
It will bite other people

2133
02:08:55,690 --> 02:08:57,000
One of this world

2134
02:08:57,670 --> 02:08:58,850
I don't belong here

2135
02:08:59,050 --> 02:09:01,530
should i go home

2136
02:09:03,630 --> 02:09:05,240
I also have my uncle

2137
02:09:05,310 --> 02:09:06,380
Aron that I have

2138
02:09:06,740 --> 02:09:07,930
He is a bad person

2139
02:09:07,950 --> 02:09:09,310
In the name of Prowler

2140
02:09:09,580 --> 02:09:12,140
He dies for me

2141
02:09:12,330 --> 02:09:17,210
He did a lot of bad things, but I could tell he wanted to be good

2142
02:09:17,600 --> 02:09:20,580
He just doesn't know he has the right to choose, but you do

2143
02:09:21,350 --> 02:09:23,070
you can be a good person

2144
02:09:24,440 --> 02:09:26,050
folks?

2145
02:09:26,650 --> 02:09:28,290
Trust me

2146
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:29,750
I know you don't want to be a thief

2147
02:09:42,580 --> 02:09:43,720
I do not

2148
02:09:57,350 --> 02:10:04,480
*

2149
02:10:22,040 --> 02:10:23,570
Is your father still alive?

2150
02:10:24,520 --> 02:10:25,650
What the

2151
02:10:26,100 --> 02:10:27,420
your father

2152
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:29,850
You said you were still alive

2153
02:10:30,680 --> 02:10:31,890
Yes

2154
02:10:34,540 --> 02:10:35,620
Oh

2155
02:10:36,900 --> 02:10:38,330
Who are you?

2156
02:10:47,280 --> 02:10:48,900
My name is Miles Morales

2157
02:10:51,240 --> 02:10:52,550
...but you

2158
02:10:53,080 --> 02:10:54,760
You can kill Saddam, Prowler

2159
02:10:57,150 --> 02:11:01,660
If the house is soft, our

2160
02:11:01,680 --> 02:11:03,080
father will die your father

2161
02:11:05,420 --> 02:11:06,470
Help

2162
02:11:08,260 --> 02:11:09,650
you have to let me go

2163
02:11:15,690 --> 02:11:17,830
Why do I have to do this?

2164
02:11:55,270 --> 02:11:58,230
How to talk to kids who will listen

2165
02:12:16,780 --> 02:12:18,140
don't tell mom

2166
02:12:25,170 --> 02:12:27,220
I never found a suitable group to join

2167
02:12:29,070 --> 02:12:31,230
So I started my own group.

2168
02:12:34,940 --> 02:12:36,490
With some old friends.
