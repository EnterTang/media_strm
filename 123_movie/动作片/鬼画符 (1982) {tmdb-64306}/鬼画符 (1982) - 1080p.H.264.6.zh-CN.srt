Thank you, cheers.

11
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:24,713
Let's have another drink, dear.

12
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,580
Kowtow.

13
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:20,530
Don't worry, it's sacred water.

14
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,511
The God of Thunder...

15
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:57,430
Stop.

16
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,375
What's your name?

17
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:11,109
l'm Mrs. Lai.

18
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,610
And your husband's name is?

19
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,086
Lai Yangli.

20
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:21,655
Mother of the Jade Emperor...

21
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,292
King of Hell, all the Earth Gods...

22
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:28,390
Bring the ghost of Lay Yangli up here.

23
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:37,164
Listen, no matter what strange things happen,

24
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,245
keep your mouth shut.

25
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,768
Got it.

26
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,355
Stop.

27
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,531
Sit still.

28
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,440
Up.

29
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:31,489
Are you alright, master?

30
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,895
Didn't l tell you not to move?

31
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,133
l've found your husband,

32
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,260
hence the emergency landing.

33
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,397
l'll bring him here right away.

34
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,233
lt's really windy,

35
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:14,704
why isn't my husband here?

36
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,308
Stop.

37
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,677
Your husband has arrived.

38
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,815
l can't see him.

39
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:32,652
Look.

40
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,125
Yangli, you're really here.

41
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:43,396
l'm having a tough time in hell.

42
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:47,462
l know, you were a lackey when you were alive,

43
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:51,566
you must be tired with all the walking after death.

44
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:57,513
Take some money to Zhang, he'll burn something for me.

45
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:02,953
Buy some chicken feet, pigs' feet for me.

46
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,888
l'll do it.

47
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:09,359
Then hurry and pay Master Zhang.

48
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:14,991
Just ten taels, l'm off.

49
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:21,439
Yangli, l'll do as you told.

50
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,408
Don't worry, l'll go get the money now.

51
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,645
Remember, you don't need to bring too much,

52
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:31,308
just ten taels as he instructed.

53
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,614
Master, you're really something.

54
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,519
lt's easy money.

55
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,153
What a fool!

56
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,900
Brat.

57
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,493
Why did you hit me, master?

58
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,597
You little ass, you wanted me to fall to my death?

59
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,699
l'll deduct my medical fees on

60
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,710
your salary this month.

61
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,907
You've deducted a lot already,

62
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,039
there won't be anything left.

63
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,777
l don't care.

64
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,153
Please, master.

65
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,051
Give the rest to me.

66
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,385
You wish.

67
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,359
Here's a letter for you, read it.

68
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:19,631
Cousin, l've lately found the proof of corruption

69
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:22,792
done by Zhuge Sen, the lron-hand Officer,

70
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:26,030
l planned on handing it to Judge Bao at Kaifeng County,

71
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:29,403
l'll pass by your town & hope to stay for a while.

72
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,670
Your cousin, Zhou Peng.

73
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:35,946
Better don't have any grudges with the officials.

74
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:36,810
Stupid guy.

75
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,881
Faster...

76
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,120
Excuse us, we just want to borrow some money.

77
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:48,225
Du Luo?

78
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,958
l heard he died for love.

79
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:54,396
He didn't rest in peace.

80
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,998
He said that he'll come back for his revenge.

81
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,832
We can't think too much about these.

82
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,567
What are you afraid of? That he'll bite?

83
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,074
l have bad feelings about this.

84
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:05,939
Guard over there then.

85
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:06,670
Hurry...

86
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,576
Chicken shit, go on.

87
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,458
Hurry...

88
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,152
Anything?

89
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,023
No.

90
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,260
Hurry...

91
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,993
Officers, hurry!

92
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:30,532
He's over there.

93
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:31,398
Freeze.

94
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:33,228
Freeze.

95
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,964
We...

96
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,235
What are you doing here?

97
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,910
We...Get up.

98
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,808
We're doing our trade here.

99
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,877
Have you seen a young man walk past?

100
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,545
No, if people pass by,

101
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,554
we wouldn't be able to do this.

102
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,151
No?

103
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,282
He's injured,

104
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,486
he won't be going far, let's look again.

105
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,460
Yes.

106
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,134
l'm right here.

107
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,437
Zhou Peng, our chief said

108
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,339
that he'll forgive you

109
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,741
if you hand out the list.

110
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:17,442
You think you can get the list so easily?

111
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,081
l'm Mai Feihong, that mean you look down on me.

112
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:21,484
Kill him.

113
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,192
What did you do that for?

114
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,790
Anyone who knows our secrets must die.

115
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,391
l'd be dead

116
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,095
if l hand over the list to you anyway.

117
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,298
Take it if you can.

118
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:23,942
Morning.

119
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:26,437
l'm going to play chess, watch the house.

120
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:27,307
Got it.

121
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:31,041
Let me walk you out, master.

122
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,048
Sure.

123
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,055
Be careful, master.

124
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:38,949
Be careful.

125
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,047
Good.

126
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,650
Take care.

127
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,024
Why are you so polite today?

128
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,894
Nothing, l just want...

129
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:49,524
What do you want?

130
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:52,001
You've deducted all my salary this month.

131
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,265
Just watch my home for me,

132
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:55,431
got it?

133
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:57,769
Fine! What's the big deal!

134
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:58,809
l'll starve for two days, in the worst case.

135
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,058
Master, l wasn't bad mouthing you.

136
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:25,902
Ghost.

137
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:29,270
Hey, cousin, don't you recognise me?

138
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,037
l'm Zhou Peng.

139
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,280
Cousin Peng.

140
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,147
Cousin.

141
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,113
What happened to you?

142
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,450
l guess you've received my letter?

143
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,891
l'm in this state because l was under pursuit

144
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,393
by Zhuge Sen's men.

145
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,388
You've scared me.

146
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:55,791
Have a rest, and l'll buy you some medicine tomorrow.

147
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,096
Don't go out at night, in case you bump into...

148
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:01,639
Stop chatting, l want to buy some medicine.

149
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,699
Listen, Du Luo's body is missing,

150
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:07,369
and there are nine dead bodies by his grave.

151
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:10,846
One got all his blood sucked dry,

152
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,646
didn't look human.

153
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:15,049
What didn't look human?

154
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,212
Boss, medicine.

155
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:19,519
Fine...wait, he's turned into a zombie?

156
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,560
Yes, it's the Ghost Festival tonight.

157
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:24,629
Don't go out.

158
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,492
Where's the prescription?

159
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,091
Du Luo, did he kill himself for love?

160
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,462
That's the one.

161
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,029
Are you a maid of the Lin Family?

162
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:31,830
That's right.

163
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:35,065
Tell your young madam, beware of him.

164
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,471
Nonsense!

165
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:37,837
He wouldn't haunt our young madam.

166
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:39,205
What's so scary about ghosts?

167
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,180
Lady, l'm a student of Master Zhang.

168
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:46,546
You'll be fine.

169
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:47,311
Really?

170
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:48,784
Come look for me should you need help.

171
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:49,452
Your medicine.

172
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,385
Thanks.

173
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:10,464
Young madam.

174
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,012
Chuntao, you've scared me.

175
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:15,842
Time for the medicine.

176
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,142
Put it there.

177
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,846
Young madam,

178
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,512
l heard something strange when l was in town.

179
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,150
l know, Du Luo turned into a zombie.

180
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,386
So scary, what should we do?

181
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,326
Everyone said he died for me,

182
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,762
but l was never interested in him.

183
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,595
l've never returned his affection.

184
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,191
But they all say that...

185
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:38,395
Forget it.

186
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,165
Are the floats ready for tonight?

187
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,804
You'll release the floral floats downstream tonight?

188
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:45,172
We do that on Ghost Festival ever year.

189
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,438
The floats will go downstream,

190
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,104
and send away all the ghosts.

191
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,279
The young master isn't home, aren't you afraid?

192
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:52,372
What's to be afraid of?

193
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,846
l didn't do anything bad to him.

194
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,046
Go work.

195
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:56,883
Yes.

196
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,486
Young madam...what's the matter?

197
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,316
Someone in the water.

198
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:36,594
No one, young madam.

199
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,330
Could be a blurred vision.

200
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,661
Let's continue.

201
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:55,705
Du Luo.

202
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,241
Where? Young madam.

203
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,375
Over there.

204
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,087
There's nothing.

205
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,155
Over there.

206
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:10,428
Come...

207
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,224
Are you alright, young madam?

208
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,958
Take her inside first.

209
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,025
l wonder if she will be alright.

210
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,603
l guess she should be fine.

211
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,170
Young madam, take a rest,

212
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:24,503
l'll get you some medicine.

213
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:41,052
Huanzhu...

214
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,855
Young madam...ghost!

215
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:45,862
Ghost.

216
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:20,932
Chuntao...

217
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:23,762
Where are you?

218
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:39,313
Huanzhu, though l couldn't be with you while alive

219
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:43,020
l will be now.

220
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,259
Oh no! How could that be? Where?

221
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:24,124
ln the room.

222
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:24,923
Hurry!

223
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:25,621
Old Master.

224
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:26,493
Where's my daughter-in-law?

225
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:27,565
She's inside.

226
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,496
Let's go.

227
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,294
No.

228
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:29,799
Why not?

229
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:30,800
She's possessed.

230
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,564
We still have to go.

231
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,569
No...

232
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,162
Why not?

233
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,846
How could that happen?

234
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,916
Get an exorcist tomorrow to drive out the evil spirits.

235
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:45,676
Yes.

236
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:48,144
Cousin Peng.

237
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,049
Cousin.

238
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:52,148
l've an idea for your travel expenses to Kaifeng.

239
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:52,916
How?

240
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,754
My master will be away for days,

241
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,452
and we've got business.

242
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:57,529
We'll go right away.

243
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:58,653
What kind of business?

244
00:19:58,764 --> 00:19:59,822
What do l do?

245
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,991
l'm a ghost buster.

246
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,568
No, thanks. l'm scared.

247
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,898
You know what,

248
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:09,466
there's no such things as ghosts,

249
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:10,906
it's the only reason why l'm in this business.

250
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,374
You think my master knows this for real?

251
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:13,637
He's just a con artist.

252
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:15,610
Otherwise why would he need all these props?

253
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,347
You know what my name is?

254
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:18,279
Bao Tuo. (Everything's fine)

255
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,010
Exactly, everything's fine.

256
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:20,641
Where?

257
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:22,515
Get changed first, come...

258
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:23,280
Watch over me.

259
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,719
Don't worry, come.

260
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,751
Amitabha Buddha, young lady,

261
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,557
watch out, l can feel the evil spirits from your house.

262
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,962
Yes, my young madam is possessed.

263
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,159
Very scary.

264
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:37,929
l've called for Master Zhang's help.

265
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:39,594
l'm waiting for them.

266
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,229
Here we are.

267
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,239
Trying to take my business, monk? Beat it.

268
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:47,642
Amitabha Buddha,

269
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:51,011
this ghost is very difficult to catch.

270
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:52,743
Be careful.

271
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,546
Nonsense. Lead the way.

272
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:55,381
Yes.

273
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,151
This way please.

274
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:07,594
She's inside, please go.

275
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,327
Fine, go.

276
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,310
Cousin, it seems very ghostly.

277
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:24,382
Don't worry, we'll give him some cinnabar water,

278
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:25,848
and all evil spirits will flee.

279
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:27,249
The bag.

280
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,488
Hold it.

281
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,024
Go in, ring the bell.

282
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,925
Me first? l don't think it's a good idea.

283
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,965
Don't worry, go!

284
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:41,623
You...

285
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:42,665
Go.

286
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,581
Don't come in, don't come in.

287
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:09,754
Are you sure you can do it without me?

288
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:12,762
He was shivering and now he's so cocky?

289
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,630
l'm going to ring the bell, don't come in.

290
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:26,870
lt's me.

291
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:34,542
Me!

292
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,678
Don't you recognize me? l'm your cousin.

293
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:40,425
Look at you! You're all shaken up.

294
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,220
What are you afraid of?

295
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,330
Are you possessed?

296
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:50,765
Ghost!

297
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:07,315
Don't come near me, l have the peach wood sword.

298
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:09,751
l didn't do anything...

299
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:20,226
lt's me.

300
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:24,462
Why are you two brats bothering me here?

301
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,894
Take care of this, cousin.

302
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:28,973
Don't worry, l have the sword in hand,

303
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,564
l'm not afraid of any ghosts.

304
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:32,040
Then why don't you kill her?

305
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:32,508
Kill?

306
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:33,475
Kill.

307
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:44,352
Go, cousin.

308
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:45,554
Here.

309
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,927
She isn't moving.

310
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,563
Go and distract her.

311
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:01,934
l'll attack on the back.

312
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,870
Me again?

313
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:03,736
Go on.

314
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:06,868
Go!

315
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:14,149
Hey, look over here.

316
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,347
l'm here.

317
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:31,727
Spare us.

318
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,862
lf l see you two again,

319
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,803
l'll swallow you alive.

320
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,272
There won't be a next time.

321
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:47,009
You should leave now.

322
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:49,678
l'm gone...

323
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,027
So, Master?

324
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,995
This ghost is powerful.

325
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:01,758
Really?

326
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,027
That's why l dropped everything.

327
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:04,123
What now?

328
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:07,569
Amitabha Buddha, forgive me for showing up uninvited,

329
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,368
l fear that you might be injured by the evil spirit.

330
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:11,737
Good timing, monk.

331
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:12,741
Right.

332
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:15,908
You can take this job,

333
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,606
l won't fight over it with you, let's go.

334
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:18,944
Go!

335
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,881
l'm glad you're here.

336
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:22,851
My daughter-in-law is possessed.

337
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:23,318
Yes.

338
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:24,285
Don't worry.

339
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:26,482
Tell me what happened.

340
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:29,958
That was a close shave.

341
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:31,460
Hurry up then!

342
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:33,663
Do you think the ghost will follow?

343
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:36,029
Don't worry, the monk can block it, come on.

344
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:36,691
Go.

345
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:39,395
l see, please bring her out.

346
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:40,334
Yes.

347
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:45,075
Here she is.

348
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:47,205
Old Master.

349
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:48,840
Put her on the bed.

350
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:50,540
Be careful.

351
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:08,323
Yinyang, Sunrise from east, the light of truth.

352
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:11,664
Heaven's physical strength,

353
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,829
expel the evil spirits, turn to lucky.

354
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:21,609
l'm about to perform the exorcism.

355
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:22,907
Excuse us.

356
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,005
Leave.

357
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:25,980
Yes.

358
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:26,982
Let's go.

359
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:40,889
Namo Sakyamuni Buddha...Amitabha Buddha

360
00:26:40,999 --> 00:27:11,593
Namo Sakyamuni Buddha...Amitabha Buddha

361
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:04,429
Buddha pearls will help me to exorcise the evil spirit.

362
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:12,065
Sincerely the good fortune will cover everything.

363
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:28,220
The fragrant herb, the light will illuminate everything

364
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:13,930
We're home, thank goodness.

365
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:16,940
Who would have thought...

366
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,372
that l'd see a real ghost?

367
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:19,204
You're unlucky.

368
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,277
Go inside.

369
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,146
What's happening?

370
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:28,810
My master is back.

371
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:32,855
Take off the clothes, now.

372
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:33,719
Why?

373
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:34,553
lf he sees this,

374
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,286
he'll deduct my next month's salary.

375
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,418
That was scary.

376
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,996
Something's wrong, it's chilly.

377
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:46,036
Don't worry, it's all fake.

378
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:48,230
l could make it more windy.

379
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:49,306
Really?

380
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,308
l'll show you, look.

381
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:55,101
Wind.

382
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:59,342
Wind...

383
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,348
Just like the real thing.

384
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,483
Did you make...

385
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:05,419
all these strange things?

386
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:06,353
Of course.

387
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:08,550
lf not, how could we fool our clients?

388
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,285
Right

389
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:10,554
l can make it stop.

390
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:11,651
Really?

391
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:13,828
Stop.

392
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:15,864
Stop.

393
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:19,767
That's enough, Master.

394
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:22,567
He's not a client, he's my cousin.

395
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:23,766
Stop.

396
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:28,310
What did l tell you?

397
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:29,380
Makes sense.

398
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,105
Let's go and get changed.

399
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:30,839
Alright.

400
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:37,447
Not bad.

401
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:40,115
ls this the new style, master?

402
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:51,193
Look! Flying candles.

403
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,369
lmpressive.

404
00:32:56,607 --> 00:33:00,475
On remote control with no visible wires, amazing.

405
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:11,155
You must have spent tons on the new gimmicks,

406
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:12,813
master. l'm sure they cost a lot.

407
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,228
Automatic changing lights, innovative.

408
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:28,435
Bao Tuo...

409
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:31,303
Excellent Dolby surround sound system.

410
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:34,173
Great...

411
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:39,714
Look, cousin.

412
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:46,748
My master has improved in makeup.

413
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:47,722
ls that so?

414
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:50,992
No, it's a woman.

415
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:53,529
Don't worry, look again. She's human.

416
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,761
Why would l lie to you?

417
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:59,494
lt's real.

418
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,301
Ghost!

419
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:15,416
Benefactors, l'm Mrs. Lin.

420
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,010
Don't be afraid.

421
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:20,250
Of course we are afraid, you're a ghost.

422
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:28,860
You can look now.

423
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:30,194
Don't scare us.

424
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:30,926
That's right.

425
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:32,400
l won't.

426
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:35,762
Are you real? We've just come back from your house,

427
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:36,703
we tried to perform exorcism.

428
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:37,274
Right.

429
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,672
l know.

430
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:41,210
Du Luo killed me,

431
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:43,507
and he has killed several monks.

432
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:45,741
lf he killed you, why are you haunting us?

433
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,341
Right...every debt has its debtor.

434
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:51,177
Because he couldn't have me,

435
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:54,349
he's on his way to Kaifeng, and plans to hurt my sister

436
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:55,619
We're heading to Kaifeng too.

437
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,318
Don't listen to him.

438
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:00,193
l know you're going there,

439
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:02,232
l beg you to help my younger sister.

440
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:03,800
Sounds like Du Luo is a fierce ghost,

441
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:05,163
he's killed the monks even.

442
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,237
How can we help your sister?

443
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:09,329
lf you bring me to Kaifeng,

444
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,499
l'd look for Judge Bao to save my sister.

445
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,906
Right, we're also...

446
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,409
Shut up, will you?

447
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,311
l wouldn't let him to hurt my sister.

448
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,714
You must take me there,

449
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:22,547
l'll kill you if you refuse.

450
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:23,779
Take your time.

451
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:25,355
l'll find you a good travel agency,

452
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,890
and you can go on a luxury trip.

453
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:31,960
You must bring me there.

454
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:35,055
Fine...

455
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,394
But how?

456
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,235
Here's a spell.

457
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:41,601
l'll attach my soul on it.

458
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:43,196
Place it inside an umbrella,

459
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,002
and you can take me along to Kaifeng.

460
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,415
Master Zhuge.

461
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:57,545
Has Zhou Peng left for Kaifeng?

462
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:01,325
Because strange things have happened lately,

463
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:04,826
the officers you sent here were killed by demons.

464
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:07,289
l don't care about ghosts,

465
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,088
l just want to catch Zhou Peng.

466
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,258
Yes.

467
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,694
He's got the proof.

468
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:15,636
lt involves higher officials too.

469
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:19,400
lf Judge Bao gets the evidence,

470
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,670
we'll all be in trouble.

471
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:23,508
So what should we do?

472
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:27,442
l'm here because of this.

473
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:29,918
Find me 20 experts,

474
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,888
l must get rid of him even if l have to go to Kaifeng.

475
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,861
Enjoy your dinner, Mrs. Lin.

476
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,631
How much money do we have left?

477
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:44,632
Not much left.

478
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,703
Let's go spend the rest.

479
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:47,532
Good idea.

480
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:52,439
Wait, you two have work to do.

481
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:54,074
What now?

482
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:57,306
l know that Du Luo the ghost

483
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,315
is on his way to Kaifeng,

484
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:01,612
if we meet him on the road,

485
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,415
we won't be able to fight him.

486
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:05,614
What should we do?

487
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:09,323
There's a very spirited opera performer,

488
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,327
even the ghosts fear him.

489
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,021
lf you can find him,

490
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,757
it would be much easier.

491
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,259
That's easy, tell us

492
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:19,700
what's his name, where is his address,

493
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:20,930
we can go find him.

494
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:21,868
Right.

495
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,565
l'm not sure.

496
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:27,007
l only know he gambles at Hongli gambling house.

497
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:28,141
How could we find him?

498
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,406
There are plenty of people there.

499
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:30,912
How could we tell who's he?

500
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:33,313
He's got a special mark,

501
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,385
there are seven moles on his foot.

502
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:38,652
Do l tell everyone to take off their

503
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,246
shoes and show me their feet?

504
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:42,451
Please think of something.

505
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,549
But how?

506
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:46,728
l got it!

507
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:47,388
What's your idea?

508
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:48,590
Feet reading.

509
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:53,466
Let me take a look...

510
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:55,739
Anything?

511
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,966
No.

512
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,266
Fine...l'll tell you.

513
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:02,243
You all have tough lives.

514
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:04,280
Bad luck, fake oaths,

515
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:06,509
you use people,

516
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,245
money worshippers.

517
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:11,253
You are scared of the bullies,

518
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:13,823
but bully the gentle ones.

519
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:16,449
Just by one look at your feet, my friend,

520
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,391
l know that you're unlucky.

521
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:20,793
Bullshit.

522
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:30,540
My wager.

523
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,844
Wu Shunchao,

524
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:38,938
don't think that because you're an opera performer,

525
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:42,542
and this rotten stuff would worth anything.

526
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:44,612
Enough excuses.

527
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:46,349
l've lost everything here.

528
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:48,288
l must win something tonight.

529
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:49,984
The fortune teller told me that

530
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,965
l have 7 stars on my foot, a general type, l'll be rich

531
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,332
Seven stars? You'll be broke.

532
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:00,896
Whatever.

533
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,200
How much for this?

534
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:09,674
Three taels? Fine.

535
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:13,577
Three taels? l'll punch you three times, kick him out.

536
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:25,386
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

537
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:31,564
What are you two doing?

538
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:33,397
Oh nothing, just checking.

539
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,199

And you'll have plenty of children.

543
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,403
You'll have a good career path.

544
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:44,310
And always on a winning streak.

545
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:45,580
But l still lose.

546

With our instructions, l guarantee you'll win.

547
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:48,876
Really?

Of course.

549
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:50,444
Certain?

550
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,316
Absolutely.

551
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,549
What are you waiting for?

552
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:56,790
l wouldn't lie to you, come on.

553
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:59,488
Don't worry, you have nothing to lose.

554
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:00,427
Go inside.

555
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:01,526
Just listen.

556
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:06,568
Were you telling the truth?

557
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:09,362
That the umbrella will bless me?

558
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:12,567
l guarantee it will go smoothly.

559
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:13,910
How?

560
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:15,035

561
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:16,078

00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:32,790
You will definitely win.

569
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:35,457
Anything you please.

570
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,801
Too bad l don't have any cash

571
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:39,460
You don't need to use cash.

572
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:40,093
Then what do l use?

573
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:40,898
Paper money.

574
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:44,031
Really? lf you're that good,

575
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,336
l'll do whatever you tell me to.

576
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,810
Fortune tellers could lie to you for a decade,

577
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:50,642
but we'll bring you to win some money now.

578
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:51,646
l'm off then.

579
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:53,213
Don't rush.

580
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:54,249
Why?

581
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:56,683
Put this spell on you first.

582
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,778
Don't stay for too long, run when you've won.

583
00:40:58,889 --> 00:40:59,719
Stop nagging.

584
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:03,257
Alright.

585
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,954
Thanks for the umbrella, l'm off.

586
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:09,362
Wait.

587
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,909

Keep burning this.

592

Got it.

593
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,602
What are you doing here again?

594
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,502
lt doesn't worth anything.

595
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:50,665

596
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,532
But l have cash,

598
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,448
Of course.

599
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:05,715
Take it.

600
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:06,881

Do l have to stand?

606
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:20,726
Get a stool.

607
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:26,709

00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,374
Small again.

625
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:40,050

627
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:46,716

You've won again, Master Wu.

629
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,221
So lucky.

630
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,662
l don't believe that.

631
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:58,291
Believe it, he's on a winning streak.

632
00:43:58,402 --> 00:44:00,427
l don't believe it, l'll bet on Big.

633
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:01,902
Small again.

634
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:05,204
Place your bets.

635
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,506
One, two, three, Six, Small.

636
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:13,345
Wu Shunchao must be addicted now.

637
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:14,075
Why isn't he out yet?

638
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:14,582
Right.

639
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:15,777
We're almost done here.

640
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:16,711
l'll go buy some more.

641
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,878
Hurry, it will run out soon.

642
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:24,360
Fifth Brother, Wu Shunchao seems different,

643
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:27,521
luck is on his side.

644
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:29,895
l couldn't do anything,

645
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,969
even we changed Ming to shake the dices.

646
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,594
l think he's met a ghost.

647
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:39,808
Looks like it.

648
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:43,744
He's still winning.

649
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:51,387
Let me take care of him. l'm the local trickster.

650
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:01,158
Wu Shunchao.

651
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:01,788
What?

652
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,833
You're very lucky today.

653
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:05,492
l'm doing alright.

654
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:08,528
How about a game?

655
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:11,840
What do you want to play, Luo Wuhai?

656
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:15,776
Pairs.

657
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,712
Pairs? Sure.

658
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:21,881
What now?

659
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:22,508
ls that all?

660
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,177
The shops are closed,

661
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:26,119
l picked these from the temple.

662
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,155
Stack it.

663
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:28,582
Stack what? lt's all run out.

664
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:29,659
Just burn it.

665
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:36,161
The master told me to buy 2 and 3 at first,

666
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:41,003
there's a 90% chance to win.

667
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:44,873
Open.

668
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:45,771
Yes.

669
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:41,695
Two.

670
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:44,127
What? Two?

671
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:45,428
That's right.

672
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:46,798
Of course it is Two.

673
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:49,429
So, what do you think, local trickster?

674
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:53,835
Pay up.

675
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:11,425
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, good.

676
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:16,432
Wu Shunchao, you're very lucky,

677
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:19,900
you want to play another game?

678
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:23,098
Sure, l'm not scared of you.

679
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:27,369
You've got guts, the money.

680
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:28,171
Yes.

681
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:32,539

Four.

684
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:46,696
Open.

685
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:47,661
Wait.

686
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:11,386
Ward away the evil spirits.

687
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:18,921
That hurts.

688
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:21,761
Why did you jump like that?

689
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:25,164
Trying to scare me with that?

690
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:31,364
These are the last four,

691
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:32,601
if he doesn't come out in time,

692
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:34,074
then we'll have nothing left.

693
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:44,342
Open.

694
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,995
Four...

695
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:03,134
Shit.

696
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:16,010
One.

697
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,553
You lose.

698
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:21,180
l'm very generous.

699
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,282
l'll give you another chance,

700
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:25,156
another game.

701
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:27,526
l've lost everything.

702
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,499
Let me pawn something.

703
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:33,228
No.

704
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:36,101
lf you don't have money now, you can go get it.

705
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:37,473
Fine.

706
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:46,442
Keep that safe for me.

707
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:47,346
Yes.

708
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:56,356
What happened?

709
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:01,597
lt's turned into paper money, how?

710
00:50:01,698 --> 00:50:02,392
What's going on?

711
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:05,195
He knows black magic? Men.

712
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:05,859
Here.

713
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:08,631
Catch him.

714
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:11,469
Here.

715
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:14,604
Chief,

716
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:17,110
l saw Zhou Peng coming from that way.

717
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:17,942
Really?

718
00:50:25,288 --> 00:50:27,051
lt's your fault. You should have left...

719
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:28,317
as soon as you won something.

720
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:30,859
You didn't burn enough paper money.

721
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:33,293
That cross-eyed did something to ward off my power.

722
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:34,489
l couldn't stand that.

723
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:36,889
lf we can beat it,

724
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,297
we'll take the sedan.

725
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:40,364
You know it's all come down to fate.

726
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:41,596
l don't believe in that.

727
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:44,071
We can go to another gambling house.

728
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:46,836
Tell the umbrella to bless me again,

729
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:48,376
or l won't listen to you.

730
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:50,439
Lower your voice! Let's go.

731
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,514
Go!

732
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:00,181
The umbrella...l see.

733
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:07,889
What? Trying to sell something?

734
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:09,363
We won't buy anything, move it.

735
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:13,999
Wu Shunchao, you've got some nerve,

736
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:15,162
you used paper money

737
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:18,332
on my turf?

738
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:19,204
Pay up.

739
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:20,936
Why didn't you say something when l was there,

740
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:23,308
it's too late to claim they are fake now.

741
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:26,143
Making up excuses? Beat him up.

742
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,059
My umbrella.

743
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:42,796
Take it.

744
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:46,598
Don't take my umbrella.

745
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:48,296
l won't be in any unfavourable situation.

746
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:52,170
Mrs. Lin.

747
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,637
Mrs. Lin, are you inside?

748
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:03,820
The umbrella is here, catch! One-eyed captain.

749
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:17,527
Chief, he's gone.

750
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:20,397
He's gone.

751
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:21,095
Go after him!

752
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:21,568
Me again?

753
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:22,865
Go! l'll look for the umbrella.

754
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,302
lt's here, l've got it.

755
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:38,079
You've found it?

756
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:39,712
Yes, where's my cousin?

757
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,415
He's been taken away by the officers.

758
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:42,184
Let's go save him.

759
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:44,089
Save him? Aren't you afraid to die?

760
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:46,185
Let's go back to the inn first and ask Mrs. Lin's ghost

761
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:48,094
Go.

762
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:07,545
Zhou Peng, you've been here for a day.

763
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:08,879
You should have thought it over,

764
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:11,484
hand out the list.

765
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:13,055
And l might spare your life.

766
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:15,351
You'll kill me all the same even if l hand the list out

767
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:16,891
lf you won't,

768
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:20,824
l can make you.

769
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:23,024
No matter what, l won't hand it out.

770
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,058
Oh really?

771
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:28,260
You heard him,

772
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:29,998
entertain Mr. Zhou for me.

773
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:30,970
Yes.

774
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,011
Here?

775
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:39,979
l think that's what she said.

776
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:40,845
Let's go.

777
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:45,382
Sounds like beating.

778
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:45,977
Right.

779
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:46,953
Let's go up.

780
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,089
You're heavy, let me do it.

781
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:50,159
And me?

782
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,158
Stand still.

783
00:53:58,568 --> 00:53:59,500
Stop.

784
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:03,270
You are a tough man, aren't you?

785
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:10,677
Wait.

786
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,245
Master Zhou couldn't take such heavy punishment.

787
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:18,611
Feed him, he must be starving.

788
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:27,193
Oh no, he's trying to burn him.

789
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:28,127
What now?

790
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:29,129
Ask her.

791
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:30,397
What should we do?

792
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,161
Open the umbrella.

793
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,031
Quick.

794
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:37,730
Flew over.

795
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:38,637
Climb up.

796
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:39,837
What? You again?

797
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,035
l'm lightweight.

798
00:54:58,328 --> 00:54:59,488
He's possessed.

799
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:01,029
Let me take a look.

800
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:12,599
Hurry.

801
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,363
Up.

802
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:23,003
What?

803
00:56:23,113 --> 00:56:25,172
How could you fall? lt's not high.

804
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:27,173
He's out.

805
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:31,579
Pick him up.

806
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:35,951
Relax, you've escaped.

807
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,822
What am l doing here?

808
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:39,258
You were possessed by Mrs. Lin.

809
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:39,885
Possessed?

810
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:41,463
Let's go.

811
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:42,929
Bring me along.

812
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:44,021
The umbrella.

813
00:56:48,037 --> 00:56:49,026
Go after them.

814
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:57,704
Go first, wait for me at the temple.

815
00:56:57,814 --> 00:56:58,439
And you?

816
00:56:58,548 --> 00:56:59,810
l'll block them.

817
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:00,712
Give me the umbrella.

818
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:01,647
lsn't itjust the same?

819
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:02,877
lf they catch you,

820
00:57:02,986 --> 00:57:04,783
and they will use the ghost's power.

821
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:06,253
Shut up and beat it!

822
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:13,858
There's a ghost in the umbrella,

823
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:15,828
that's really great!

824
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,422
How great is that?

825
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:19,661
You fool, haven't you heard?

826
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,134
Whoever takes the umbrella

827
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:24,400
can control the ghost inside?

828
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:25,872
What should we do?

829
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:27,567
Go to the temple.

830
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:28,837
Go...

831
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,476
Zhuge, l'm here.

832
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:34,813
Hurry.

833
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:38,075
Over there.

834
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:51,465
He's over there.

835
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:52,466
Go.

836
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:00,804
What should we do now, chief?

837
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:01,899
Let's go back, it's futile chasing a hard-pressed enemy

838
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:02,943
Yes.

839
00:58:21,197 --> 00:58:21,993
Can burn the umbrella.

840
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,225
Are you nuts? How could you burn that?

841
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:28,930
Who told you to take so long for the firewood?

842
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:29,834
l can't take this anymore.

843
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:33,734
You can't burn this, there's a spell inside.

844
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,708
You took too long, l was freezing.

845
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:38,080
Not having an axe to cut wood, we picked these.

846
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:40,649
No matter what, burn them now.

847
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:43,719
l'm freezing, add some more, quick.

848
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:45,611
You're not an idiot,

849
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:47,383
you could wear something.

850
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:49,287
From where? Yours?

851
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:52,895
You should find your own.

852
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:54,930
l thought we were brothers.

853
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,589
Take it.

854
00:58:57,967 --> 00:58:59,332
You're absolutely useless.

855
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:05,731
Put it down. Holding that won't make you warmer.

856
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:07,641
You do it.

857
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:10,978
Pick some firewood too.

858
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:11,876
Me again?

859
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:19,286
l always get the bad jobs.

860
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:29,358
This is strange.

861
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:04,164
Let me go!

862
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:33,928
What are you doing?

863
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:35,088
There are...

864
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:36,028
What?

865
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:37,531
There're...

866
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:38,601
The firewood?

867
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:39,998
Ghosts!

868
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:41,365
Ghosts?

869
01:00:42,572 --> 01:00:45,040
Yes, we have one as company.

870
01:00:46,242 --> 01:00:47,709
Not Mrs. Lin!

871
01:00:48,277 --> 01:00:49,642
What then?

872
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:52,239
There are...

873
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:53,975
lnjustice.

874
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:55,550
Here they are.

875
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:07,420
lnjustice.

876
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:13,166
We are very scary...

877
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:17,803
Scary? Scary is when l tear your heads off,

878
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:20,133
trying to scare us wearing masks?

879
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:21,141
Beat him up.

880
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:29,109
Fakes?

881
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:47,462
l've taken one down.

882
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:49,293
Careful.

883
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:53,637
Thanks, cousin.

884
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:54,641
You're welcome.

885
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:01,777
lt doesn't seem right.

886
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:04,248
Weapons.

887
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:30,475
Let's split, l've got it.

888
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:33,179
Let's split...

889
01:02:33,282 --> 01:02:36,445
At least you ran fast enough.

890
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:38,213
l don't see Wu Shunchao helping

891
01:02:38,321 --> 01:02:39,811
us just now.

892
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:42,117
Right, where's he?

893
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:42,919
Let's go beat him up.

894
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:43,719
Good idea.

895
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:47,358
Where's he?

896
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:49,564
Where's he hiding?

897
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:53,063
Wu Shunchao...

898
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:55,902
Wu Shunchao...

899
01:02:56,005 --> 01:02:57,472
He couldn't hear us even though we're so loud.

900
01:02:57,573 --> 01:02:58,665
Must be sleeping like a pig.

901
01:02:58,775 --> 01:02:59,139
Let's go look for him.

902
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:00,140
Alright.

903
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:08,614
Let's play a trick on him.

904
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:09,514
OK.

905
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:15,454
One more.

906
01:03:15,558 --> 01:03:16,456
Twist his arm.

907
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:18,490
You think you can fool us

908
01:03:18,594 --> 01:03:19,891
by this kind of disguise?

909
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:22,160
His hand is cold.

910
01:03:22,265 --> 01:03:23,197
He's scared.

911
01:03:34,577 --> 01:03:36,738
Who's that? So noisy.

912
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:46,149
Blinks.

913
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:47,153
Go!

914
01:03:58,501 --> 01:03:59,627
Don't come near.

915
01:03:59,735 --> 01:04:00,793
Or l'll kill you.

916
01:04:00,903 --> 01:04:01,870
l'll kill you.

917
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:21,920
Cousin.

918
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:40,368
Because of you two brats,

919
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:41,773
l couldn't sleep peacefully.

920
01:04:42,144 --> 01:04:43,042
You?

921
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:45,513
Come here...

922
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:46,445
Having an epilepsy?

923
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:48,517
lt's not so scary with the wall.

924
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:49,607
What are you doing?

925
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:51,584
My cousin is fighting a ghost outside.

926
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:52,244
ls that so?

927
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:53,617
Yes, why aren't you helping?

928
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,247
Help? l'm unlucky.

929
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:57,223
Leave me alone. l'm scared.

930
01:04:57,326 --> 01:05:00,523
You should think of something.

931
01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:24,418
Help him out.

932
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:30,782
Ghost!

933
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:35,530
He looks scary.

934
01:06:05,328 --> 01:06:06,158
Scared, huh?

935
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,821
The City God's robe is useful.

936
01:06:08,931 --> 01:06:10,626
Useful? Why don't you go after him?

937
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:14,703
After him? That's a ghost.

938
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:16,066
He's scared of your robe.

939
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:17,935
Go! Get even for Mrs. Lin.

940
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,098
Get even for Mrs. Lin.

941
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:19,765
Really? Me?

942
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:21,103
Yes, go!

943
01:06:22,611 --> 01:06:23,600
Get the umbrella.

944
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:28,514
lt's missing.

945
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:30,312
Missing? Where did you leave it?

946
01:06:30,419 --> 01:06:31,317
Right here.

947
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:34,755
You lost it while we were fighting?

948
01:06:34,857 --> 01:06:35,846
Look for it again.

949
01:06:55,611 --> 01:06:56,873
l'm scared.

950
01:06:58,114 --> 01:06:59,479
Don't follow me if you're scared.

951
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:04,848
Hey ghost, come out

952
01:07:04,954 --> 01:07:08,981
we're your friends here.

953
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:15,330
You're trying to fool a ghost?

954
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:20,494
You all have a bowl of dog's blood,

955
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:23,800
and you tell me you're my friends.

956
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:26,499
Will you come out or not?

957
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:29,139
lf you won't,

958
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:35,073
we'll splash you with dogs' blood.

959
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:37,618
Do l come out on your demand?

960
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:40,681
Very rude.

961
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:43,824
l'm coming out.

962
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:49,623
What do you want?

963
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:54,394
l want...oh, right.

964
01:07:54,503 --> 01:07:56,835
How could you protect Wu Shunchao?

965
01:07:56,939 --> 01:08:00,136
l gave him a ''sure-win'' spell.

966
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:01,239
That means the spell drawn by a ghost?

967
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:02,207
That's right.

968
01:08:02,311 --> 01:08:04,541
Works like magic.

969
01:08:05,047 --> 01:08:06,776
Draw me one then.

970
01:08:06,882 --> 01:08:10,147
l already have, it's underneath your bowls.

971
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:13,080
Look...

972
01:08:13,189 --> 01:08:14,747
There's nothing.

973
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:18,925
Nothing...

974
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:21,589
You're bluffing.

975
01:08:21,697 --> 01:08:23,324
You think that you don't have to worry

976
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:25,423
when we pour off the blood, right?

977
01:08:25,534 --> 01:08:26,330
Men.

978
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:27,026
Yes.

979
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:28,899
Burn it.

980
01:08:29,004 --> 01:08:33,270
Don't, l'll draw it.

981
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:34,273
Hurry then.

982
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:35,805
l'll draw.

983
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:53,892
How do l use this?

984
01:08:53,996 --> 01:08:55,759
l could tell you

985
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:58,231
on one condition.

986
01:08:58,334 --> 01:09:00,734
Spill it.

987
01:09:00,836 --> 01:09:03,737
This is a ''whatever you wish for'' spell.

988
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:06,171
You can get whatever you want.

989
01:09:06,275 --> 01:09:08,436
But after you're done,

990
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:11,035
you must return this umbrella to the two young men.

991
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:12,136
Fine.

992
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:13,647
Remember.

993
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:19,644
Oh, one more thing,

994
01:09:19,755 --> 01:09:22,315
you can only have one wish.

995
01:09:22,424 --> 01:09:27,418
From now on, you can ask for whatever you want.

996
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:37,697
Dear, l want...

997
01:09:37,806 --> 01:09:39,899
Boss, l want

998
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:41,442
Dear.

999
01:09:41,544 --> 01:09:42,442
Alright.

1000
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:53,454
What?

1001
01:09:53,556 --> 01:09:54,853
l don't think the boss would care for us anymore.

1002
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:55,548
Right.

1003
01:09:55,658 --> 01:09:56,989
Let's bug him.

1004
01:09:58,594 --> 01:09:59,583
Dear.

1005
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:00,662
l want gold.

1006
01:10:00,763 --> 01:10:01,821
l want to be a top official.

1007
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:03,057
l want to be an Emperor.

1008
01:10:03,165 --> 01:10:04,723
l want a pearl the size of my fist.

1009
01:10:04,833 --> 01:10:06,323
l want to date a young man.

1010
01:10:06,435 --> 01:10:07,595
l want a mistress.

1011
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:08,829
l want the secrets of winning.

1012
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:10,166
l want to hit the lottery.

1013
01:10:10,272 --> 01:10:11,261
l want to win the Trio.

1014
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:12,397
l want to win the Quinella Place.

1015
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:14,169
Dear, l want...

1016
01:10:14,276 --> 01:10:17,905
l want anything (all types of ghosts)

1017
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:21,306
l said the wrong thing.

1018
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:37,993
What do you want us here for?

1019
01:10:49,144 --> 01:10:50,236
So crowded!

1020
01:10:52,114 --> 01:10:53,411
We're here.

1021
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:54,573
l know.

1022
01:10:55,317 --> 01:10:57,012
What is he doing, covering his face?

1023
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:02,856
What? We're not thieves.

1024
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:05,222
l'm different, l'm in the entertainment business.

1025
01:11:05,327 --> 01:11:07,659
Look at me now!

1026
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:10,425
lt's embarrassing bumping into people who know me.

1027
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:11,897
Hurry up.

1028
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:14,961
We've reached Kaifeng, Cousin Peng. hat now?

1029
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:16,469
We're here on a mission.

1030
01:11:16,572 --> 01:11:19,006
Let's go find Judge Bao and then Mrs. Lin's sister.

1031
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:19,938
Tell her that her sister is dead?

1032
01:11:20,042 --> 01:11:20,770
Right.

1033
01:11:20,876 --> 01:11:22,810
Don't count on me, look at me!

1034
01:11:22,911 --> 01:11:24,310
How could l go out like this?

1035
01:11:24,413 --> 01:11:26,210
Pay up, l want to buy new clothes.

1036
01:11:26,315 --> 01:11:26,906
Money again?

1037
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:28,711
You two can buy something too.

1038
01:11:29,318 --> 01:11:31,684
You ask for pocket money everyday, we're not your dad.

1039
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:34,717
That's the pain of being an actor, you two go ahead.

1040
01:11:34,823 --> 01:11:35,755
Go! He's so vain.

1041
01:11:39,395 --> 01:11:41,363
Here you go...

1042
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:42,725
What are you doing?

1043
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,291
A ghost for you.

1044
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:48,792
Ghost.

1045
01:11:50,005 --> 01:11:50,699
What are you doing?

1046
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:51,795
For you.

1047
01:11:57,413 --> 01:11:58,380
l want the umbrella.

1048
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,674
This one, why?

1049
01:11:59,782 --> 01:12:00,476
To block the sun.

1050
01:12:00,582 --> 01:12:01,412
There's a ghost inside.

1051
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:02,745
l'm not scared.

1052
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:03,545
You're not?

1053
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:04,584
l'm not.

1054
01:12:05,421 --> 01:12:07,321
You can have it...

1055
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,515
Thanks.

1056
01:12:08,624 --> 01:12:10,956
Bye...

1057
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,289
He's got the ghost too.

1058
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:21,694
Mr. Gongsun, please pass this message to Judge Bao.

1059
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:24,269
No problem.

1060
01:12:24,773 --> 01:12:26,604
Zhuge Sen is a corrupt official,

1061
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:28,700
Judge Bao has known for a while.

1062
01:12:28,811 --> 01:12:31,371
But we don't have any proof.

1063
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:34,381
Now that you've brought the evidence here,

1064
01:12:34,483 --> 01:12:38,214
l believe we can put him on trial.

1065
01:12:39,755 --> 01:12:42,451
l've another request.

1066
01:12:42,825 --> 01:12:44,053
What's that?

1067
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:45,353
This is my cousin Bao Tuo.

1068
01:12:45,461 --> 01:12:46,951
Right, l've the same surname as Judge Bao.

1069
01:12:47,062 --> 01:12:47,892
Shut up.

1070
01:12:49,832 --> 01:12:51,732
He accompanied me on the way,

1071
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:53,734
we've encountered a strange incident.

1072
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:55,861
What kind of incident?

1073
01:12:56,438 --> 01:12:57,370
Here it is.

1074
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,072
Who are you looking for?

1075
01:13:00,175 --> 01:13:02,166
You fools, l'm here to look for Judge Bao,

1076
01:13:02,277 --> 01:13:03,335
send him out.

1077
01:13:03,445 --> 01:13:04,776
What do you want to see him for?

1078
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,041
l'm delivering an umbrella.

1079
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:08,207
Send the word.

1080
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:10,746
ls he really so powerful?

1081
01:13:10,853 --> 01:13:12,343
What do you suggest, Mr. Gongsun?

1082
01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:14,752
Judge Bao put Guo Huai on trial once at night,

1083
01:13:14,857 --> 01:13:17,223
he used anti-evil mirror and a Tiger head chopper,

1084
01:13:17,326 --> 01:13:19,055
and he's scared all ghosts.

1085
01:13:19,161 --> 01:13:21,925
l don't think it's a problem

1086
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:24,396
to deal with one ghost.

1087
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:27,264
Where's the female ghost you mentioned?

1088
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:27,835
She is...

1089
01:13:27,936 --> 01:13:28,868
Mr. Gongsun.

1090
01:13:29,605 --> 01:13:31,903
There's a Wu Shunchao outside,

1091
01:13:32,007 --> 01:13:34,635
he said he's delivering an umbrella to Judge Bao.

1092
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:36,370
Please decide.

1093
01:13:36,478 --> 01:13:39,572
Mr. Gongsun, the female ghost is inside.

1094
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:44,149
We'll deal with the demon, then Zhuge Sen.

1095
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:45,515
Good night, Miss.

1096
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:15,242
Finally we meet,

1097
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:17,910
you look so much like your sister.

1098
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:19,883
Who are you?

1099
01:14:19,988 --> 01:14:22,684
Me? l'm here to marry you.

1100
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:24,383
Answer to my sword first.

1101
01:14:26,161 --> 01:14:27,628
What's all that noise in the room?

1102
01:14:27,729 --> 01:14:28,661
Let's take a look.

1103
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,811
Meet me t'row late night at Du Family's deserted house

1104
01:14:45,914 --> 01:14:46,846
We'll get married.

1105
01:14:50,352 --> 01:14:52,912
Miss...

1106
01:14:53,255 --> 01:14:54,347
Are you alright?

1107
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:56,216
She's passed out.

1108
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:10,330
Go take a look.

1109
01:15:18,614 --> 01:15:20,172
His blood got sucked out.

1110
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:22,474
We must be careful.

1111
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:23,448
Yes.

1112
01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:33,660
Why are you here?

1113
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:40,530
She looks possessed.

1114
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:45,605
Why are all these people here? l will kill you all.

1115
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:51,977
The anti-demon mirror.

1116
01:15:53,415 --> 01:15:54,109
Catch.

1117
01:16:07,529 --> 01:16:08,689
She's awake.

1118
01:16:13,035 --> 01:16:14,400
What are you doing here?

1119
01:16:14,937 --> 01:16:16,268
Why am l wearing a red dress?

1120
01:16:16,371 --> 01:16:17,429
You were possessed.

1121
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,070
Who are you?

1122
01:16:19,174 --> 01:16:20,573
Your life-saver.

1123
01:16:20,676 --> 01:16:21,438
Life saver?

1124
01:16:21,543 --> 01:16:22,407
You don't believe us?

1125
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:24,411
You may ask your sister who is inside.

1126
01:16:27,883 --> 01:16:28,850
My sister is inside?

1127
01:16:28,951 --> 01:16:30,509
Just open up the umbrella.

1128
01:16:36,191 --> 01:16:39,160
l'm here, sister.

1129
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:42,656
Don't be scared, l'm your elder sister,

1130
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:44,095
l won't hurt you.

1131
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:48,695
Are you really dead?

1132
01:16:49,171 --> 01:16:51,196
Sister, Du Luo has turned into a fierce ghost,

1133
01:16:51,306 --> 01:16:54,173
he killed me and he wants to kill you.

1134
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:55,573
Really?

1135
01:16:55,677 --> 01:16:57,110
lf not for them,

1136
01:16:57,212 --> 01:16:59,271
you'd have married him already.

1137
01:16:59,381 --> 01:17:01,372
What should l do now?

1138
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:03,212
l've sent Judge Bao

1139
01:17:03,318 --> 01:17:05,047
for his help to deal with Du Luo.

1140
01:17:05,153 --> 01:17:06,848
The only choice we have

1141
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:08,855
is to destroy the ghost.

1142
01:17:09,591 --> 01:17:10,956
We'll set up a trap,

1143
01:17:11,059 --> 01:17:13,493
pretend that your sister doesn't know anything.

1144
01:17:13,595 --> 01:17:15,688
We'll go to the temple first thing tomorrow morning,

1145
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:18,823
take the 4 Heavenly Kings' statues to deserted house

1146
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:23,234
to press down the ghost, l have my plans.

1147
01:17:23,338 --> 01:17:24,896
l'm not scared of ghosts, but l'm scared of Zhuge Sen.

1148
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:25,803
Why?

1149
01:17:25,907 --> 01:17:27,966
Mrs. Lin has everything worked out.

1150
01:17:28,076 --> 01:17:30,544
Right, but where is she now?

1151
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:31,772
What if Zhuge Sen shows up,

1152
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,142
what shall we do?

1153
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:36,647
You're not scared of a ghost but a mere human?

1154
01:17:38,186 --> 01:17:40,984
You fix this, l'll attend to the other things.

1155
01:17:48,897 --> 01:17:50,057
Zhou Peng, get out.

1156
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:53,493
Oh no, Zhuge Sen's here!

1157
01:17:53,602 --> 01:17:54,660
Don't be scared, go!

1158
01:17:55,303 --> 01:17:56,668
They are here, go.

1159
01:17:59,474 --> 01:18:01,669
Zhou Peng, very bold indeed!

1160
01:18:01,777 --> 01:18:03,972
You sent a woman to tell me to come here.

1161
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:05,239
Where's the list?

1162
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:07,679
That's why we are here.

1163
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:10,618
How do you want to finish this?

1164
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:12,710
l've got the list right here;

1165
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:15,820
if you win, it's yours.

1166
01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:17,482
lf you lose,

1167
01:18:17,592 --> 01:18:19,583
come with me to see Judge Bao.

1168
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:23,761
Just the two of you?

1169
01:18:24,266 --> 01:18:25,426
Are you scared?

1170
01:18:25,734 --> 01:18:27,759
Enough said, kill them.

1171
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:37,644
Go!

1172
01:19:12,781 --> 01:19:13,748
l don't want to look.

1173
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,548
Don't worry, l've blocked it.

1174
01:19:27,863 --> 01:19:29,592
Oh no, the mirror is broken!

1175
01:19:36,638 --> 01:19:38,037
l got him, beat him up.

1176
01:19:44,846 --> 01:19:45,744
My list.

1177
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:48,313
Thank goodness it's here.

1178
01:19:54,356 --> 01:19:55,687
l got you.

1179
01:19:57,325 --> 01:19:59,259
Sorry, cousin, very sorry.

1180
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:05,991
l don't have it, he has it.

1181
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:23,984
l won't wear it, it hurts. You always tease me.

1182
01:20:24,085 --> 01:20:25,109
Sorry about it.

1183
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:27,381
Bear with it, let me help you.

1184
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:29,252
Fine.

1185
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:31,550
What now?

1186
01:20:31,893 --> 01:20:34,919
We have to go to the Du Family's deserted house.

1187
01:20:35,997 --> 01:20:36,588
Do we have to?

1188
01:20:36,698 --> 01:20:37,426
Yes.

1189
01:20:39,534 --> 01:20:40,398
Miss.

1190
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:41,230
Let's go.

1191
01:20:42,103 --> 01:20:43,195
Where's the spell?

1192
01:20:43,305 --> 01:20:44,203
Here.

1193
01:21:10,031 --> 01:21:12,022
Where are they? We will get beaten up.

1194
01:21:12,133 --> 01:21:13,566
We don't have a choice.

1195
01:21:13,668 --> 01:21:14,657
What then?

1196
01:21:14,769 --> 01:21:15,701
We'll get beaten up.

1197
01:21:15,804 --> 01:21:17,533
Fine, we'll take turns.

1198
01:21:17,639 --> 01:21:18,264
Alright.

1199
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:20,807
Hand it out if you both don't want to die.

1200
01:21:20,909 --> 01:21:21,603
What if we don't?

1201
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:24,042
No? l'll torture you slowly.

1202
01:21:24,379 --> 01:21:25,641
You think l can't take it?

1203
01:21:26,748 --> 01:21:27,510
My turn.

1204
01:21:29,284 --> 01:21:30,114
My turn now.

1205
01:21:31,953 --> 01:21:32,817
Come on.

1206
01:21:49,437 --> 01:21:52,531
Zhuge Sen, surrender if you are smart,

1207
01:21:52,641 --> 01:21:54,768
l'll ask Judge Bao for a lighter sentence.

1208
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:58,045
Do you think l'll be scared because you have back up?

1209
01:21:59,147 --> 01:22:02,241
You one-eyed captain! You're very arrogant.

1210
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:04,477
Miss, show him what you've got.

1211
01:22:09,724 --> 01:22:10,520
Zhou Peng.

1212
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:12,024
Why are you here so late?

1213
01:22:12,127 --> 01:22:13,788
He's almost killed us.

1214
01:22:17,799 --> 01:22:18,697
Sister.

1215
01:22:23,972 --> 01:22:24,904
Possessed.

1216
01:22:27,242 --> 01:22:28,539
Beat him.

1217
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:37,541
Protect Mr. Gongsun, l'll take care of them.

1218
01:22:37,652 --> 01:22:38,516
Go!

1219
01:23:50,759 --> 01:23:52,522
This is called ''Possession''.

1220
01:23:53,828 --> 01:23:54,988
Again.

1221
01:23:57,899 --> 01:23:58,923
Cousin, get even!

1222
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:00,228
Get even.

1223
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:25,053
You deserve this.

1224
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:25,990
That's right.

1225
01:24:26,094 --> 01:24:26,958
Not bad, cousin.

1226
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:27,892
Not bad at all.

1227
01:24:29,597 --> 01:24:30,427
lt's your turn to die.

1228
01:24:30,532 --> 01:24:31,499
Exactly.

1229
01:24:32,434 --> 01:24:34,231
He can't take it, why are you staring at him?

1230
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:36,030
Mr. Gongsun, arrest him.

1231
01:24:36,137 --> 01:24:36,660
Take him back.

1232
01:24:36,771 --> 01:24:37,499
Yes.

1233
01:24:43,711 --> 01:24:44,268
Cousin

1234
01:24:44,379 --> 01:24:47,348
What? Go in, you fool.

1235
01:24:51,619 --> 01:24:52,847
Still alive?

1236
01:25:01,729 --> 01:25:03,424
What else have you got?

1237
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:09,561
ls he trembling?

1238
01:25:09,671 --> 01:25:11,730
No, it looks like he's having a seizure.

1239
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:19,406
Are you alright?

1240
01:25:19,514 --> 01:25:21,448
l'm tired.

1241
01:25:21,549 --> 01:25:22,846
Zhuge Sen is arrested,

1242
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:25,215
l will return to Kaifeng with the young lady first.

1243
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,811

1244
01:25:27,922 --> 01:25:30,413
Yes, all ready to go.

1245
01:25:31,559 --> 01:25:33,390
The chopper and anti-demon mirror?

1246
01:25:33,495 --> 01:25:34,655
Anti-demon mirror, oh no!

1247
01:25:34,762 --> 01:25:35,990
lt's broken.

1248
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:38,626
How could you be so careless?

1249
01:25:38,733 --> 01:25:39,495
Don't worry,

1250
01:25:39,601 --> 01:25:41,068
we've got plenty of stuff here,

1251
01:25:41,169 --> 01:25:43,399

1252
01:25:44,272 --> 01:25:45,534
We'll head back first.

1253
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:47,107
Please.

1254
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:47,998
Take him.

1255
01:25:48,109 --> 01:25:49,007
Take him.

1256
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:50,702
Get up.

1257
01:25:51,079 --> 01:25:52,376
Take him.

1258
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:53,838
What now?

1259
01:25:53,948 --> 01:25:55,506
Set the place up.

1260
01:25:57,051 --> 01:25:58,678
You didn't give the list to him?

1261
01:25:58,786 --> 01:25:59,718
This is a fake.

1262
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:00,185
A fake?

1263
01:26:00,288 --> 01:26:01,084
Look.

1264
01:26:10,365 --> 01:26:12,890
Your work is done, Cousin Peng.

1265
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:15,629
Your dead parents will rest in peace.

1266
01:26:16,037 --> 01:26:17,504
What else are you thinking of?

1267
01:26:18,439 --> 01:26:20,373
Let's help Wu Shunchao,

1268
01:26:20,475 --> 01:26:21,567
or it will be a mess

1269
01:26:21,676 --> 01:26:22,802
when the ghost comes.

1270
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:25,741
Are you two done?

1271
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:26,677
Get to work.

1272
01:26:27,115 --> 01:26:28,343
Come help.

1273
01:26:30,752 --> 01:26:31,582
Don't think about it too much.

1274
01:26:33,788 --> 01:26:36,154
Either of you could do this,

1275
01:26:36,257 --> 01:26:37,019
why did you pick me?

1276
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:39,855
Because you're a wisecrack, the ghosts will be scared.

1277
01:26:39,961 --> 01:26:40,552
Sorry about this.

1278
01:26:40,662 --> 01:26:41,356
Sorry about this?

1279
01:26:41,462 --> 01:26:42,486
Sit...

1280
01:26:42,597 --> 01:26:44,030
l always get the bad tasks.

1281
01:26:49,437 --> 01:26:50,699
When will that ghost arrive?

1282
01:26:50,805 --> 01:26:52,238
l know,

1283
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:55,207
there will be a sudden wind,

1284
01:26:55,310 --> 01:26:56,777
when you feel cold.

1285
01:26:58,446 --> 01:26:59,105
Don't move.

1286
01:26:59,948 --> 01:27:01,040
Where are you two going?

1287
01:27:01,149 --> 01:27:02,514
We're setting up a small windmill outside.

1288
01:27:02,617 --> 01:27:03,675
And we'll know when

1289
01:27:03,785 --> 01:27:06,049
...it starts spinning.

1290
01:27:07,288 --> 01:27:07,947
Remember to keep an eye on me.

1291
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:08,852
Got it.

1292
01:27:17,732 --> 01:27:18,721
Sit here and wait.

1293
01:27:20,201 --> 01:27:22,396
Don't go too far.

1294
01:27:22,503 --> 01:27:23,231
We won't.

1295
01:27:26,307 --> 01:27:27,239
Where should we hide?

1296
01:27:27,342 --> 01:27:29,936
Where? Behind the rockwork.

1297
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:48,059
Help! Help me!! Help!

1298
01:27:48,162 --> 01:27:49,026
What is it?

1299
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:50,154
l saw a ghost.

1300
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:50,890
Ghost?

1301
01:27:50,999 --> 01:27:51,431
Yeah, it's a ghost.

1302
01:27:51,532 --> 01:27:52,362
Where?

1303
01:27:52,467 --> 01:27:57,063
At the back, don't let him get close. l'm scared.

1304
01:27:57,171 --> 01:28:01,699
That's no ghost, it's just a rat, go.

1305
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:23,424
Help...

1306
01:28:23,531 --> 01:28:24,725
What now?

1307
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:26,026
There are lots of bats.

1308
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:27,499
You're afraid of bats?

1309
01:28:27,602 --> 01:28:29,661
Sit still, the bats won't touch you.

1310
01:28:29,771 --> 01:28:30,999
They look ugly.

1311
01:28:31,105 --> 01:28:31,867
Go back.

1312
01:28:32,206 --> 01:28:32,638
Come on.

1313
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:33,900
Yes.

1314
01:28:35,343 --> 01:28:36,173
Gone.

1315
01:28:36,778 --> 01:28:38,678
l can't believe them, we're supposed to be a team.

1316
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:49,814
Mom!

1317
01:28:51,092 --> 01:28:53,322
Wu Shunchao is screaming like a chicken again.

1318
01:28:53,428 --> 01:28:54,793
lgnore him, go to sleep.

1319
01:29:03,805 --> 01:29:05,295
lt's windy, let's go.

1320
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:19,217
How could he take it this time?

1321
01:29:20,822 --> 01:29:21,345
Let's take a look.

1322
01:29:21,456 --> 01:29:22,184
Sure.

1323
01:29:24,926 --> 01:29:26,018
Wu Shunchao.

1324
01:29:26,894 --> 01:29:29,829
He's sleeping too.

1325
01:29:30,732 --> 01:29:31,756
Let's scare him.

1326
01:29:31,866 --> 01:29:32,594
Sure.

1327
01:29:47,415 --> 01:29:49,975
What are you doing? You scared to death of him?

lt's working.

1329
01:30:14,942 --> 01:30:16,500
Pull the spell.

1330
01:30:25,086 --> 01:30:25,745
Scared?

1331
01:30:28,122 --> 01:30:29,817
The ghost is on top of me.

1332
01:30:30,391 --> 01:30:31,050
Help.

1333
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:32,786
That's Wu Shunchao.

1334
01:30:33,194 --> 01:30:36,254
Wu Shunchao...

1335
01:30:36,364 --> 01:30:39,356
Ghost! l'm scared.

1336
01:30:39,467 --> 01:30:40,695
Over there.

1337
01:30:40,802 --> 01:30:42,736
Don't worry, we'll take him down together.

1338
01:30:43,237 --> 01:30:45,535
And you said you're not scared, look at him.

1339
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:48,598
He's not going anywhere, get a duvet!

1340
01:30:48,709 --> 01:30:49,801
A duvet?

1341
01:30:56,884 --> 01:30:57,976
Die once more.

1342
01:30:58,085 --> 01:30:58,983

What now?

1345
01:31:03,191 --> 01:31:03,953
What? Break his bones.

1346
01:31:04,058 --> 01:31:05,116
Right.

1347
01:31:05,226 --> 01:31:06,750
You two may leave...

1348
01:31:06,861 --> 01:31:08,419
it's your turn now.

1349
01:31:13,267 --> 01:31:14,427
The Four Heavenly Kings.

1350
01:31:20,541 --> 01:31:22,566
Oh no, they are broken.

1351
01:31:27,615 --> 01:31:29,014
Anti-demon mirror?

1352
01:31:29,116 --> 01:31:31,141
lt's broken by One-eyed captain.

1353
01:31:36,457 --> 01:31:37,515
Move over.

1354

Tools.

1355
01:31:41,195 --> 01:31:41,786
What tools?

1356
01:31:41,896 --> 01:31:43,989
Of the Four Heavenly Kings'

1357
01:31:46,801 --> 01:31:47,597
Would they work?

1358
01:31:47,702 --> 01:31:49,329
l won't lie, go.

1359
01:31:57,445 --> 01:31:58,469
Beat him.

1360
01:31:59,180 --> 01:31:59,942
Beat you to death.

1361
01:32:07,955 --> 01:32:08,887
He's angry.

1362
01:32:08,990 --> 01:32:10,287
Don't let him scare you, beat him.

1363
01:32:41,822 --> 01:32:42,948
Kneel.

1364
01:32:47,361 --> 01:32:48,589
Beat you up.

1365
01:32:51,332 --> 01:32:51,821
All broken.

1366
01:33:21,295 --> 01:33:23,456
The umbrella is broken, cousin. Your turn.

1367
01:33:26,734 --> 01:33:28,361
Wu Shunchao is missing.

1368
01:33:28,469 --> 01:33:29,197
Yes.

1369
01:33:48,990 --> 01:33:52,926
Sorry, Mr. Ghost, l won't do it next time...

1370
01:33:53,027 --> 01:33:54,619
Wu Shunchao, you're slacking off,

1371
01:33:54,729 --> 01:33:55,991
go help out.

1372
01:33:56,364 --> 01:33:58,696
l won't.

1373
01:33:58,799 --> 01:34:00,289
Don't come near me.

1374
01:34:00,401 --> 01:34:03,370
Go...

1375
01:34:04,271 --> 01:34:04,965
l won't go no matter what.

1376
01:34:05,072 --> 01:34:06,903
Have you forgotten? There are 7 stars on your foot.

1377
01:34:07,008 --> 01:34:07,838
Right, l'm not scared of anything.

1378
01:34:07,942 --> 01:34:08,408
Ghost?

1379
01:34:08,509 --> 01:34:09,976
Yes, l'm scared of ghosts.

1380
01:34:12,213 --> 01:34:13,305
You're in trouble.

1381
01:34:14,649 --> 01:34:15,809
Of course we are.

1382
01:34:15,916 --> 01:34:17,747
l'm referring to him.

1383
01:34:18,519 --> 01:34:19,508
Anti-demon mirror.

1384
01:34:19,620 --> 01:34:20,780
Seven stars on foot.

1385
01:34:20,888 --> 01:34:23,220
Yes...

1386
01:34:23,324 --> 01:34:25,554
We are the best team.

1387
01:34:30,097 --> 01:34:30,722
Go!

1388
01:34:30,898 --> 01:34:32,024
Go!

1389
01:34:42,443 --> 01:34:43,842
You've squashed me.

1390
01:34:51,252 --> 01:34:53,447
Cover him with the spells.

1391
01:34:54,388 --> 01:34:56,288
Here...

1392
01:35:11,672 --> 01:35:12,536
Here.

1393
01:35:27,254 --> 01:35:27,948
What now?

1394
01:35:28,055 --> 01:35:29,022
Burn him.

1395
01:35:33,861 --> 01:35:34,828
Burn him.

1396
01:35:37,531 --> 01:35:38,293
This is it.

1397
01:35:38,666 --> 01:35:39,997
Not only that he can't roam about,

1398
01:35:40,101 --> 01:35:42,365
but he has vanished for good.

1399
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:43,994
Wu Shunchao, you should change jobs.

1400
01:35:44,105 --> 01:35:44,594
To what?

1401
01:35:44,705 --> 01:35:45,569
Ghost buster!

1402
01:35:45,673 --> 01:35:46,571
Ghost buster? l think not.

1403
01:35:46,674 --> 01:35:49,006
l've 7 stars on my foot, l am destined to be rich

1404
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:51,169
Let's go tell the young lady,

1405
01:35:51,278 --> 01:35:52,609
that we've avenged her.

1406
01:35:52,713 --> 01:35:54,510
And tell Mrs. Lin to draw us another spell,

1407
01:35:54,615 --> 01:35:55,673
so that l can play again.

1408
01:35:55,783 --> 01:35:56,511
Let's go.

1409
01:36:00,721 --> 01:36:03,019
lt's all over now.
