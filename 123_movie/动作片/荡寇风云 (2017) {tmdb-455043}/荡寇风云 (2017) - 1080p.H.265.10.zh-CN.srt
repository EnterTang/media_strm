1
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,810
明 嘉靖年间
During the reign of Ming Emperor Jiajing (1522-1567)

2
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:03,720
由于朝廷海禁地方官府腐败沿海倭寇蜂起
Japanese pirates raided the coastlines of China because of the sea ban.

3
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,060
其中被认为乃倭寇之首的
The chief of these Japanese pirates

4
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,610
却是一个安徽人王直屡次进犯沿海
was actually a Han Chinese man called Wang Zhi.

5
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,520
嘉靖三十六年
In 1557,

6
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,930
浙江总督胡宗宪说服王直投诚
The Zhejiang commander led Wang

7
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,930
助除倭寇之患
to turn against the pirates.

8
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,940
怎料王直随即被杭州竭巡按王本固收押
But Wang was subsequently imprisoned by the Governor of Hangzhou.

9
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:29,270
倭寇不降反四处生事攻击浙江沿海
So the pirates continued to raid the coastal areas of Zhejiang.

10
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,560
此时王直之义子毛海峰
Wang's godson Mao Haifeng

11
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,850
与一支上千人的倭寇部队
and over 1,000 pirates

12
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,060
占据了浙江岑港
occupied Cengang

13
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,560
大量自沿海抢来的各种物资集结于此
with the loot pillaged from the coast.

14
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:47,560
明军在俞大猷指挥下围攻了五个多月
The army under Commander Yu Dayou besieged them for 5 months.

15
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,900
浙江总兵  俞大猷
Yu Dayou Garrison Commander of Zhejiang"

16
00:02:58,777 --> 00:03:05,777
荡       寇       风       云

17
00:03:07,777 --> 00:03:11,111
毛     劲     松     封     装
Mao Jinsong encapsulation

18
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,350
冲呀
Charge!

19
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,930
一起 开炮
Fire!

20
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,970
冲呀
Charge!

21
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,520
将军
General!

22
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,230
将军
General!

23
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,690
将军 你没事吧
Are you alright?

24
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,020
将军 快要顶不住了
We can't hold them off!

25
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,140
撤吧
We should fall back.

26
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,640
撤退
Retreat!

27
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,600
大人
Sir!

28
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,270
他们就这样傻傻的
Like fools,

29
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,140
每次按着同一时辰来攻我们呢
they launch their attacks at the same hour each time.

30
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,720
铁炮队 收队
Guns Unit dismissed!

31
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,230
按时早饭
They eat on time,

32
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,930
按时冲锋 按时败退
attack and retreat on time.

33
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,390
明军真有纪律呀
The Ming troops have such discipline!

34
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,480
大人
Sir!

35
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,100
部队们见一直都是浪人在领功
The ronins get all the credit.

36
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,680
士兵们不会觉得没趣吗
Won't the soldiers feel snubbed?

37
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,430
谢谢
Thank you.

38
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,730
对付这些明军
The ronins are sufficient

39
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,230
浪人就够了
to take on the Ming troops.

40
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,520
既然明军如此不济
If these troops are so pathetic,

41
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,270
将军为何不进攻内地
why didn't you invade the inland

42
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,400
胁迫朝廷放我义父
and force the Ming Court to release my godfather?

43
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,190
将军
General,

44
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,270
忘了松蒲大人的话了
have you forgotten what Lord Matsura said?

45
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,890
海峰兄
Haifeng,

46
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,190
不用提醒我
no need to remind me.

47
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:39,810
五峰大人对松蒲藩的贡献 我们都很清楚
We're aware of Master Wufeng's (Wang Zhi) contribution to the Matsura clan.

48
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,850
但 松蒲大人说过这里的所有行动
But Lord Matsura made it clear

49
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,980
不能以他的名义进行
we're not acting on his behalf.

50
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,180
我们是倭寇 不是松蒲军
We're wokou.

51
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,020
我们是贼
We are pirates,

52
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:57,020
领头的是五峰大人
under the command of Master Wufeng.

53
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,730
当六十个浪人
If 60 ronins

54
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,230
可以直达南京城下捣乱明军时
can reach Nanjing and defeat the Ming troops,

55
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,560
我们一千部队
we have a regiment of 1,000 men,

56
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,440
为何只守不攻
why can't we take the offensive?

57
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,560
孙子用兵之法
According to the Art of War,

58
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,480
十则围之五则攻之
encircle when we outnumber the enemy 10 to 1

59
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,430
明军以十倍于我军的军队围攻我
and attack when it's 5 to 1.

60
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,480
我们可以守住
We only managed to hold them off

61
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,770
是倚仗地利天险
because we have the benefit of a natural barrier.

62
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,270
我一千军队一旦没有了地利
Without that edge,

63
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,480
也一样会输
we will lose just the same.

64
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,540
我们会像那60个浪人一样结束
We will end up like those 60 ronins.

65
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,440
大人
Sir!

66
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,930
大人太高估明国的军队了
You have overestimated the Ming troops.

67
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,560
光是南方就有驻军二十万
They have 200,000 men stationed in the south

68
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,020
对手是明国将军俞大猷
under the command of Yu Dayou.

69
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,850
明国的军队贪生怕死朝廷官员贪污腐败
Ming troops are cowards and Court officials are corrupted.

70
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:08,320
多来几个俞大猷又有什么用
A few more like Yu Dayou means nothing.

71
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,350
最近呢
Recently,

72
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,940
有一个文武双全叫戚继光的将军出现
a general named Qi Jiguang showed up

73
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,190
他带领明军连战连胜
and led the Ming troops in winning several battles.

74
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,900
戚继光
Qi Jiguang?

75
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,940
在干什么
What are they doing?

76
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,150
这班畜牲
Bastards!

77
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,730
由得他们吧
Leave them alone.

78
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,020
为什么
Why?

79
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,230
老师
Sensei

80
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,060
我们是武士却要跟这些流氓一起作战
why should samurais fight alongside ronins

81
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,520
还要看着他们胡作非为
and put up with their atrocious behavior?

82
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,890
这只是各取所需
To each his own.

83
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,940
我们漂洋过海来到这里
We came from across the ocean

84
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,440
是要为大名取得财富
to help the Daimyo build his fortune

85
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,940
购买火枪好让主公强大起来
and to buy firearms to make him powerful.

86
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,060
而他们要的是
They came here

87
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,940
女人钱财
for women and money.

88
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:29,980
他们的行径不合武士仁义
Their behavior is unworthy of a samurai.

89
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,770
但也得满足他们
But we must keep them happy

90
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,100
这样他们才会卖命的
so they will risk their lives for us.

91
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,860
少主 你只要记住
You must remember

92
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:46,010
我们能在此赚钱买武器
we're here to make money and buy weapons

93
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,060
只是为了统一天下
in order Japan can rule the world.

94
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,150
其他的事情都不重要
Nothing else matters.

95
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,480
要打败明国
To defeat the Ming Court,

96
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:02,480
不能只谈仁义也要有战略
benevolence is not enough. We also need strategy.

97
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,980
待山川少主你成了大名之后
When you become the Daimyo, Master Yamagawa,

98
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,440
到时候再多谈仁义吧
you can be more benevolent.

99
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,980
万一被明国知道是我们松蒲出兵
If the Ming Court found out we're from the Matsura Army,

100
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,020
会让松蒲藩陷于危险
it will endanger the Matsura clan.

101
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:20,150
我们是倭寇
We're pirates,

102
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,060
穷凶极恶的倭寇
savage pirates.

103
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,270
少主你懂吗
Do you understand?

104
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,060
俞将军
General Yu!

105
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,390
胡大人
Commander Hu!

106
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,440
你受伤了
You're injured!

107
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,390
小伤而已
It's nothing.

108
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,650
我正准备天黑之前再冲锋
I intend to launch another attack before dark.

109
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,720
"Hu Zongxian Supreme Commander of Zhejiang"

110
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,440
像这样的冲锋有用吗
What's the use?

111
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,600
俞将军
General Yu!

112
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,140
宁绍台参将戚继光
I'm Assistant Regional Military Commissioner Qi Jiguang.

113
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,060
你就是戚继光
So you're Qi Jiguang.

114
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,650
你说我冲锋没用
If you think my plan doesn't work,

115
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,770
那你有什么有用的方法
you have a better idea?

116
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,230
尚无方法
Not yet.

117
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,310
不过像俞将军这样冲锋
You've been doing this

118
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:23,230
也有好几个月了吧
for several months, right?

119
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,850
俞将军
General Yu,

120
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,560
京中再三催促
the Imperial Court is getting impatient.

121
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,020
离一月破敌之日只有二十天
You have 20 days left of your one-month deadline.

122
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,060
所以呢
That's why

123
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,730
我打算让元敬训练的新军试一试
I intend to let Jiguang give it a try with his New Army.

124
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,140
元敬的新军
They have wiped out pirates

125
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,270
已经接连在浙西剿灭了三路贼兵
in western Zhejiang in 3 successive battles.

126
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,060
俞将军
General Yu,

127
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,180
你已经久攻了好几个月了吧
you have been fighting for months.

128
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,900
人马疲乏
You must be exhausted.

129
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:01,810
而且你的属下多以水师为主
Besides, most of your men are trained at sea...

130
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,690
属下遵从命令就是
I will follow your orders.

131
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,730
胡大人不必解释
There's no need to explain.

132
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,140
"Lu Tong Second Commander of Zhejiang"

133
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,720
胡大人只是想让俞将军稍事休息而已
Commander Hu only wants you to rest up.

134
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,350
卢将军 我们走吧
Let's go, General Lu!

135
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,520
喝酒去
Let's go for a drink.

136
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,850
好 请
Sure! After you...

137
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,890
元敬
Jiguang,

138
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,940
先锋的重任就交给你
I'm making you the vanguard.

139
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,270

143
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,020
攻呀
Charge!

144

00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,390
把敌人的头拿回来
Bring me their heads.

146
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,020
大家冲呀
Charge!

147
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,690
不要后退
Don't back off!

148
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,480
危险 退后
Watch out! Fall back!

149
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,430
撤退
Retreat!

150
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:47,860
"Hu Zongxian Residence"

151
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,150
数量核示清楚
Count them carefully!

152
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,400
胡大人
Commander!

153
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,100
元敬你来了
Jiguang,

154
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,110
来来来
come here

155
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,150
你们调兵遣将
You deploy the troops,

156
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,180
我呢只懂调钱调财
I deploy the money.

157
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,350
这浙江如今是什么都缺呀
Zhejiang is short of supplies right now.

158
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,720
坐吧
Have a seat.

159
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,520
龙山所雁门岭之役
At the battle of Yanmen Ridge,

160
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,730
我们以数倍倭寇的兵力
we outnumbered the pirates,

161
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,640
只和他们打个平手
but we only managed a tie.

162
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,730
怎么还敢报功呢
We dared not report a victory.

163
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,270
不曲道以媚时
Never violate the rules of life to suit the time.

164
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,430
不诡行以邀名
Never commit treachery to attain fame.

165
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:51,890
这个道理世人皆懂
It is easier said than done.

166
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,820
可我却做不到
I, for one, cannot do it.

167
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,400
你可知道
Do you know

168
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:05,180
此时此刻有多少双眼睛在盯着我们吗
all eyes are on us right now?

169
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:09,610
我们如今只能赢 不能输
We can't afford to lose.

170
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,940
输了 朝廷震动天下权变
A defeat will shake the Imperial Court to its core.

171
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,520
所以这一战
This is a battle

172
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,310
你只能赢
you must win.

173
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,850
你三箭定胜负
The three arrows you shot

174
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,100
已成军中美颂
became a legend in the Army.

175
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,310
大家都指 能在你手下作战
Everyone hopes to fight under your command.

176
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,900
心中会有安稳之心呀
They feel safe.

177
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,110
败就败在求安稳之心呀
But this is also our handicap.

178
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,110
大人
Commander,

179
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,560
当兵的哪有求安稳的
soldiers should not expect to be safe.

180
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,230
大人 我请许重组新军
Please allow me to set up a new army.

181
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,770
请大人批许
I need your approval.

182
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,180
杀贼方是当务之急
Fighting the pirates is your top priority.

183
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,270
怎么能去练兵呢
You have no time to train soldiers.

184
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,150
你专心杀敌就好了
Concentrate on taking out the enemies.

185
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,270
可是他们见到倭寇就跑
The sight of pirates make them flee.

186
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,730
仗还没打就已经败了
The battle is lost before it began.

187
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,560
大人你说这仗怎么打
How can we fight like that?

188
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,610
有你在 大家一定会变的
They can change with you in command.

189
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,310
这正是我从山东把你请过来的目的
This is why I brought you from Shandong.

190
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,480
要你 杀敌邀功
I need you to wipe out the pirates.

191
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:26,060
我们可以杀敌 练兵两不担误同时进行
I can kill pirates and train soldiers at the same time.

192
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,280
练新兵 练新兵 元敬
Train soldiers...

193
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,230
浙江兵怕倭寇
Zhejiang soldiers are scared of pirates.

194
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:34,820
已经是个定局了 练不了的
That's a fact. What more can you do?

195
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,810
大人
Commander,

196
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,820
十室之邑必有忠信
you can find someone faithful even in a town with 10 houses.

197
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,810
堂堂全浙 岂无材勇
There must be someone courageous in Zhejiang.

198
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,150
况且由我来自行训练
If I'm in charge of the training,

199
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,020
更可以省掉不少请客兵的军费
you can save the money on hiring Guest Troops.

200
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,390
好呀
Very well!

201
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,520
好呀
Very well!

202
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,520
好呀 元敬
Very well, Jiguang.

203
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,260
难得你愿意费神再去训练新军
If you take the trouble to train a new army,

204
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,270
我怎么能不支持呢
I must show my support.

205
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,190
只是雁门岭一役
About the battle of Yanmen Ridge,

206
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,060
我必须要报军功
we must report this extraordinary feat

207
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,480
全歼倭寇 就这么定了
of wiping out the pirates.

208
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:30,390
上 上
Go!

209
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,640
哥
Jiguang!

210
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,270
我们日日闹了好几天了
We have been doing this for days.

211
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,810
什么时候打呀？
When are we going to fight?

212
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,400
你有方法攻上去吗
You have a better plan?

213
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,860
这有什么办法 冲呀
What plan? Just charge ahead!

214
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,810
将军每天来
The General comes here every day

215
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,390
就想破敌之法
trying to think of a plan.

216
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,020
不攻不打
We don't attack or fight,

217
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,930
不就让敌人松懈嘛
because we want the enemy to let their guard down.

218
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:59,520
楼楠 你又猜到我在想什么了
Lou Nan, you can always read my mind.

219
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:00,980
这太可怕了
That's too scary!

220
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,720
回去吧
Let's go back.

221
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,230
明军又不攻进来了
The Ming Army did not launch an attack.

222
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:12,060
是不敢战吗
Are they afraid to fight?

223
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,770
三十不到已被奉为名将
He made a name for himself before he turned 30.

224
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,360
这人是个奇才
Don't lower your guard.

225
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,190
别掉以轻心
This man is a genius.

226
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,320
回营休息 收起将旗
Let's return to camp and take down the banners.

227
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,270
是
Aye!

228
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,020
将军
General!

229
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,230
开始下雨了
It's raining!

230
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:46,350
哥
Jiguang,

231
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,150
这仗什么都准备好了
everything is ready.

232
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,060
现在下着雨
Shouldn't we

233
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,230
我们不就是应该趁着下雨夜袭嘛？
launch the attack in the rain?

234
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,060
趁着下雨夜袭
In the rain?

235
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,850
是呀
Yes!

236
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,890
你能想得出来
If you can think of it,

237
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,350
倭寇也能想得到
so can the pirates.

238
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,270
去休息吧
Go get some rest.

239
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,350
这说是休息
You should

240
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,690
不是应该回军营休息吗 哥
return to camp.

241
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,850
行行行 休息休息
Alright... I'll get some rest.

242
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,900
你哥向来以奇兵取胜
Your brother is known to take his enemies by surprise.

243
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,440
等吧
Let's wait!

244
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,190
听命
Listen up...

245
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,020
原地休息
get some rest!

246
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:37,560
小心明军趁着下雨夜袭
Beware of an attack in the rain at night.

247
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,940
大家提高警觉
Be vigilant!

248
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,690
听清楚没有 啊
Did you hear me?

249
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,440
真多想法
What a pain!

250
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,810
好吧
Very well!

251
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,190
别吵了 在怕什么
What are you afraid of?

252
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,440
还给你
Here...

253
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,430
安心吧 我没碰过她
Relax! I didn't lay a hand on her!

254
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,100
我是武士
I'm a samurai,

255
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,650
跟你们不一样
unlike the lot of you.

256
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,440
木幡 喝酒
Drink up, Kohata!

257
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,560
都睡着了
They're asleep.

258
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,810
太好了
Excellent

259
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,430
通知俞将军 只要一听到炮声
Tell General Yu to meet me in the mountain

260
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,980
就上山和我们会合
when he hears the cannon.

261
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,230
把大家叫醒 马上出发
Wake up the troops, we're moving out.

262
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,110
小声点
Keep it down!

263
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,180
什么事
What's going on?

264
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:35,850
拉…
Pull...

265
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,810
突袭 被突袭了
A raid! We've been attacked!

266
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:49,140
上呀
Charge!

267
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,110
冲
go

268
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:53,940
糟了
We're in trouble!

269
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,070
攻呀
Run!

270
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,640
攻呀
Charge!

271
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,100
跟我走 来
Follow me!

272
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:10,610
我不去
I'm not going!

273
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,730
给我追
After them!

274
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,270
第一部队 出击
Unit 1, charge!

275
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,060
出发
Let's move out!

276
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,310
大人
Sir!

277
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,360
明军已突破我们的防线
The Ming Army broke through our line of defense.

278
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,810
那么快
Already?

279
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:48,030
那个将军果然厉害
That general is formidable indeed.

280
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,110
老师
Sensei,

281
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,100
我们过去帮忙吧
let's go give them a hand.

282
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,940
已攻上了寨门就守不住了
They're at the front gate. We can't hold them back.

283
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,600
我们不会输给明军
We won't let them beat us.

284
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:05,150
明国是一头大象 不能硬碰的
The Ming Dynasty is like an elephant; you can't take it head on.

285
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:08,260
只打必胜的 不打平手的
I want a win, not a tie.

286
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,890
即使打胜但有损伤我也不愿意
But not a win at the expense of casualties.

287
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,480
还是退吧
We should retreat.

288
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,730
大人 退吗
Are you sure?

289
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:19,900
谁愿意殿后
Who's willing to bring up the rear?

290
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,690
当然是我
Me, of course!

291
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,570
拜托你

撤退吧
Come on!

298
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,940
少主
Master Yamagawa,

299
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,690
可以帮我忙吗
can you give me a hand?

300
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,230
我很乐意
My pleasure.

301
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:50,860
撤退 撤退
Retreat!

302
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,190
这边走
This way!

303
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,110
你们要走
You must leave.

304
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,360
不舍得也要快点撤退
We must go even if you don't want to.

305
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:30,810
俞将军
General Yu!

306
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,820
请进
Please come in.

307
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,650
佩服了
Impressive!

308
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:35,520
佩服了
I'm impressed!

309
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,940
楼楠
Lou Nan!

310
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:41,850
将军
General!

311
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:42,690
怎么回事
What is it?

312
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,770
贼兵已经走了
The pirates are gone.

313
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:45,480
地上很多碎银
They left behind scraps of silver.

314
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,900
将士们都在四处搜银
The soldiers are busy picking them up.

315
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,610
哥 这村民要见你
Jiguang, this villager wants to see you.

316
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,890
将军 将军
General...

317
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,230
起来说话
Please get UP!

318
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,190
将军 还有很多村民被锁在旧房里面
Other villagers are still locked up.

319
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:01,440
将军你快去救救他们吧 将军
Please rescue them quickly, General.

320
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,440
带我去
Take me there!

321
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:06,690
就在这
Over here!

322
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,060
哥
Jiguang!

323
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,430
戚将军来救我们了
General Qi is hereto save us.

324
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,100
大家快出来 快出
Come out, all of you!

325
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,690
戚将军来救我们了
General Qi is hereto save us.

326
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,730
快出来
Come out!

327
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,070
谢谢将军
Thank you, General Qi!

328
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,560
好好好 起来吧
Please get UP!

329
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,270
抓住戚继光
Grab Qi!

330
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,470
杀
Kill!

331
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:25,610
撤呀
Let's go!

332
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:27,180
撤呀
Let's go!

333
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:37,480
蹲下
Get down!

334
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,070
准备好
Ready!

335
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,940
开炮
Fire!

336
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:55,770
哥
Jiguang!

337
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,060
救人 快救人
Get them out! Hurry!

338
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,440
哥
Jiguang!

339
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,430
救人 快
Help them...

340
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,980
哥
Jiguang!

341
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,770
你没事吧 哥
Are you alright?

342
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,690
我没事
I'm fine.

343
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:17,730
救人
Help them...

344
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,060
救人
Help them...

345
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,520
贼兵当中
Among the pirates,

346
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,520
大部份都是因为海禁
majority of them were Han Chinese dispossessed by the sea ban

347
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,890
而投靠王直的汉人
and sought refuge with Wang Zhi.

348
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:30,610
你是说我们打的不是倭寇
You're saying they are not Japanese?

349
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,020
也有浪人
They include Japanese ronins.

350
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,430
但最有战斗力的
But those with genuine combat prowess

351
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:38,270
而是一群配备精良的倭兵
are well equipped Japanese soldiers.

352
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,810
倭兵
Japanese soldiers?

353
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,560
我们就是碰到他们
That's who we're dealing with.

354
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:43,610
很少见
They're rare.

355
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,900
将军 胡大人来了
General, Commander Hu is here.

356
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,230
又来了
Again?

357
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,220
恭喜两位将军
Congratulations,

358
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,680
胡大人带来了上好的黄酒
Commander Hu brought the best yellow wine

359
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,150
跟大家庆祝一下
to celebrate with you.

360
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,020
胡大人为何带锦衣卫进来
Why did you bring the Imperial Secret Service with you?

361
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:04,560
侍中罗嘉宾几个人正要上书弹劾你
Luo Jiabin and his lot intend to impeach you

362
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,930
说你放走倭寇
for letting the pirates get away.

363
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,720
指你通敌
They said you colluded with them.

364
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,480
我没通敌
I did not!

365
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,400
我当然心里清楚了
I know.

366
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,020
我已经上报朝廷报捷了
I already reported your victory.

367
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,730
在朝廷尚未收到捷报之前
But before my report reaches the Court,

368
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,520
你先要留在家里
you are to stay home

369
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:26,480
听候发落
pending your sentence.

370
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,020
俞将军
General Yu,

371
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:34,820
抱歉了
I'm sorry!

372
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,640
没问题
No problem!

373
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,820
我会尽力周旋的
I will do my best to intercede.

374
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,360
不要只抓俞将军
Don't just arrest General Yu.

375
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,890
要抓两个一起抓
Put me under arrest as well.

376
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,150
朝廷有命
I have my orders.

377
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,070
俞将军出师不利
General Yu failed his expedition

378
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,690
纵寇南逃
and allowed the pirates to flee to the South.

379
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,770
需暂时交锦衣卫收押
The Imperial Secret Service will take him into custody.

380
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,850
俞将军 得罪了 请
Pardon us, General! This way.

381
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:06,720
明白
I understand.

382
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,770
俞将军
General Yu...

383
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,140
没事的
I'll be fine.

384
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,680
这不是我能决定的
It wasn't my decision to make.

385
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,060
当官当得这么委屈
This is so unfair.

386
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,930
那就不要当了
You should quit.

387
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,270
房子多太 俸禄多少
Tiny house, small salary...

388
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:54,480
我又不稀罕
Who cares?

389
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,060
那姓胡的声名狼藉
Hu Zongxian is notorious.

390
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,810
你在他手下
Working for him,

391
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,730
败是坏事 成也可能是坏事
win or lose, you're doomed.

392
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,110
我这妇人之见
This is just my humble opinion.

393
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,770
听还是不听
Whether or not you want to listen,

394
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,720
随你
it's up to you.

395
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,020
夫人讲的每一句话都有道理
You make perfect sense.

396
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,980
可是倭寇大敌当前
But the enemy is at the gate,

397
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,850
我又怎能不理
I can't just walk away.

398
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,930
那就天下大事
It's a state matter;

399
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,980
可是只有你一个人可担当
you can't do this alone.

400
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:45,070
不是还心中郁闷吗？
I thought you're depressed.

401
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:46,980
怎么不规矩起来了
Why this disorderly behavior?

402
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,150
我怎么不规矩呢
What do you mean?

403
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,640
夫妻行周公之礼
Sexual intercourse between husband and wife

404
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,100
是天经地义之事
is the most natural and proper thing to do.

405
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,770
又想拿礼法压我吗
Don't throw the book in my face again.

406
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,310
我哪敢
I wouldn't dare.

407
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,440
有什么不敢的
Of course you would.

408
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,610
你不是天下无敌吗
You're invincible.

409
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,480
夫人才是真正的天下无敌
You're the invincible one.

410
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,770
我们的盾挡不住呀
Our shields are not tough enough.

411
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:51,940
再想想办法
We'll think of something.

412
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,310
这就是毛海峰的倭刀
This is Mao Haifeng's sword.

413
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,360
哥
Here...

414
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,190
这刀给你当配刀吧
You can use this.

415
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:13,350
那可不行
Absolutely not!

416
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:17,190
堂堂大明将军拿一把倭刀
A Ming general using a Japanese sword

417
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:19,020
岂不长了别人的威风
is bad for morale.

418
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,980
不过这刀倒是挺锋利的
No doubt this is a good sword.

419
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:25,060
是啊 想不到如此锐利
I'm surprised it's such a trenchant sword.

420
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,070
应该跟我们的打造方法不一样
I think it's made differently from ours.

421
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:29,680
继美
Jimei!

422
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:30,610
你琢磨琢磨
Study it carefully,

423
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,560
看看这刀是怎样锻成的
and find out how it's forged.

424
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:33,390
好
Sure!

425
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:35,850
将军
General!

426
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:37,020
戚将军
General Qi!

427
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,820
胡大人刚收到了朝廷公文
Commander Hu just received Court documents

428
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,820
将军于舟山岑港破敌立功
about your victory at Cengang.

429
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:41,810
官复原职
You have been reinstated.

430
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,640
好呀
Good!

431
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,190
那俞大猷将军呢
What about General Yu?

432
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,940
还没有俞将军复职的消息
There has been no word.

433
00:34:59,450 --> 00:34:59,980
来
Come!

434
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,230
俞将军
General Yu!

435
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:08,440
俞将军
General Yu!

436
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:09,900
戚将军 卢将军
General Qi! General Lu!

437
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,100
你们来得正好
I'm glad you're here.

438
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,930
这就是我跟你们说
This is General Qi Jiguang,

439
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,690
大破岑港贼兵的戚继光
who commanded the decisive victory at Cengang.

440
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,020
久仰久仰
We have heard so much about you.

441
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,570
三位将军慢用
Enjoy!

442
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,190
都已经官复原职了
You have been reinstated.

443
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,470
还有什么忧心的
What are you worried about?

444
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,350
没想到
I didn't expect

445
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:30,190
俞将军坐牢也能坐得这么轻松
you'd be so relaxed in jail.

446
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:31,900
这些年来
Over the years,

447
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,310
在战场上牺牲的兄弟你知道有多少
have you any idea how many men were lost in battle?

448
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,980
我不过在这里等候发落
I'm just waiting for my sentence.

449
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,440
还有一些兄弟可以切磋武功
I can still practice with my men.

450
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,770
有什么可怨呢
What's there to complain about?

451
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,230
俞将军抗倭多年
You have fought the pirates for years

452
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,390
功劳不少
and earned great merit.

453
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,190
难道不觉得委屈吗
Don't you feel aggrieved?

454
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,480
我战倭多年
Yes, I fought pirates for years.

455
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,400
倭患除了吗
Have they been wiped out?

456
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,060
我惭愧呀
I feel ashamed.

457
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,400
凭什么委屈
I have no right to feel aggrieved.

458
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,770
我们在前线以血奋战
We shed our blood on the frontline

459
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:06,680
而那些昏官却在背后说三道四
while those fatuous officials badmouth us behind our backs,

460
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,570
还把责任推到您身上
and try to pin the blame on you.

461
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,070
您不觉得不安吗？
You don't find that unsettling?

462
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,690
你是说胡大人
You mean Commander Hu?

463
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,350
他为官难啊
It hasn't been easy for him.

464
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:20,480
若不是胡大人和徐渭大人
Commander Hu and Xu Wei

465
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,430
他们用各种方法保住俞某
did their best to cover up for me.

466
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:28,520
可能俞某已经跟张经大人一样身首异处了
Or else I would have been beheaded like Zhang Jing.

467
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:33,020
胡宗宪和严嵩的干儿子赵文华一伙
Hu Zongxian colluded with Yan Song's godson Zhao Wenhua

468
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,900
为他们出谋划策
and did their bidding.

469
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,190
不仅取代了张经大人
He replaced Commander Zhang Jing

470
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,520
更害死了他
and had him executed.

471
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:39,900
难道是假的吗
None of that is true?

472
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:44,020
胡大人不跟赵文华周旋
If Commander Hu didn't kiss up to Zhao Wenhua,

473
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,980
你我人头能保
you and I are probably dead by now.

474
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,390
我们何来军饷
Where do you think the army provisions came from?

475
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,480
何来战倭的机会
We'd never get the chance to fight pirates.

476
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,140
胡大人争取的
He bargained for a thankless job

477
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:56,140
是一个连打胜仗都会被杀头的苦差
that could have him beheaded even if he had won.

478
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,030
你说他这是何苦呢
Why should he bother?

479
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,640
我这命 原来就是胡大人捡回来的
Commander Hu saved my life.

480
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,060
无憾了
I have no complaints.

481
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,690
我们习武之人
As a martial artist,

482
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,230
问心无愧便是了
I'm satisfied as long as I have a clear conscience.

483
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,310
能有你来接这担子
I'm also pleased

484
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:18,560
我欣慰
that you will now take over this burden.

485
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,070
来 喝一杯
Here... have a drink with me.

486
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,980
胡大人会尽力让我出去的
Commander Hu will get me out.

487
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:38,940
俞大哥
Brother Yu,

488
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,560
小弟想向您问一件事
can I ask you something?

489
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,270
什么
What?

490
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:43,940
早闻大哥的棍法
I was told your skill with the staff

491
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:46,230
威震少林独步天下
is outstanding in Shaolin and unmatched in the world.

492
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,690
上次在岑港
I had a glimpse of it

493
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,640
有幸得以一见
last time in Cengang,

494
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,060
今日想再次请教
I'd like to take another look.

495
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,100
好
Very well!

496
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:03,520
一寸长 一寸强
An inch longer, an inch stronger.

497
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,110
寸短寸险
An inch shorter, an inch deadlier.

498
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:51,230
再来
Again!

499
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,440
戚将军 卢将军
General Qi! General Lu!

500
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,480
戚将军
General Qi!

501
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,720
卢将军 戚将军
General Lu! General Qi!

502
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,470
就在这里说
Stay where you are.

503
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,350
得知诸位将军出外勘察
I heard you were going on an inspection tour.

504
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,310
胡大人特派郑某同行协力
Commander Hu sent me to assist you.

505
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,690
请诸位多多指教
I have so much to learn from you.

506
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,770
多多指教
So much indeed.

507
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,940
你这等于来监视我们的吗
Learn from us? You're here to spy on us.

508
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:12,850
不不不
No...

509
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,570
胡大人指小人懂点笔墨
Because I can read and write,

510
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:16,730
特意让小人来协助戚将军的
Commander Hu wanted me to assist General Qi.

511
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:21,520
有劳了
Thank you.

512
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:22,730
上马了
Let's go!

513
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,320
行了 将军您坐好
Sit tight, General.

514
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,730
好了 可以出发了
We can go now.

515
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,270
嫂子
Sister!

516
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,430
好啊
Excellent

517
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:44,560
夫人
Wait up...

518
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:45,900
夫人
Wait up!

519
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,480
夫人
Hey...

520
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:48,810
你怎么了
What's wrong?

521
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:51,270
怎么了
What's wrong?

522
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:53,570
你去视察地方要几天几夜
You'll be gone for several days.

523
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,190
不带我去也是应该的
Naturally you don't want to bring me along.

524
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:56,350
谁说的
Says who?

525
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:57,390
谁说不带你去呀
Who says I'm not bringing you?

526
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:58,060
那马呢
Then where's my horse?

527
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,020
在备呀
We're getting it ready.

528
00:40:59,160 --> 00:40:59,860
在备
Getting it ready?

529
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,480
夫人 你急什么
What's your hurry?

530
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:08,400
我怎么舍得把你一个人扔在家里呢
Why would I leave you behind?

531
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,690
我舍得吗
You think I'd want that?

532
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,680
快 快 快了
Hurry...

533
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,600
马备好了
The horse is ready.

534
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:26,350
哥
Jiguang!

535
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:27,730
戚夫人 早
Morning, Madam Qi!

536
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:30,640
卢将军 早
Morning, General Lu!

537
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:33,600
刚才戚将军正跟我说
General Qi told me just now

538
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,190
等候戚夫人一起上路呢
we're waiting for you.

539
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,610
让卢将军久等了
Sorry to keep you waiting.

540
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:45,940
夫人
Allow me...

541
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,600
美女
Hey pretty lady!

542
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,150
你别这样
You guys, stop acting like this...

543
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,110
对不起
Sorry!

544
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:44,600
你们喝多了
You're drunk!

545
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:46,480
看你的了
Let's see...

546
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,980
不行 看我的呀
No, watch me.

547
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:55,230
兄弟 喝多了
You're drunk, pal.

548
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,470
我告诉你们
Listen up...

549
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:00,310
我们可是戚继光的兵
We are Qi Jiguang's troops.

550
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,900
专杀倭寇的
We specialize in killing pirates.

551
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,480
我看 你们就是倭寇
I think you're a pirate.

552
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:07,190
兄弟们
Brothers...

553
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:08,810
把他们全给我抓了
take them into custody!

554
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:26,730
大哥 大哥
Brother...

555
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:27,600
将军
General!

556
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,570
就是他 就是他打我们
That's him. He beat us up.

557
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,930
闭嘴 都他妈眼瞎了
Shut up! Are you blind?

558
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:35,310
将军
General,

559
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:38,020
这些都是你的兵
they're your troops.

560
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:39,810
他们不是我的兵
They can't be.

561
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,680
用力
Come on...

562
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:56,680
承让 承让
Thank you...

563
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:58,100
戚将军 佩服
Impressive, General!

564
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,270
承让 承让
Thank you...

565
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:01,100
还有没有人想试试
Anyone else?

566
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:02,360
要不我再来一次
Let me do it again.

567
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:04,150
算了吧你
Forget it!

568
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,100
戚夫人
Madam Qi?

569
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:09,940
戚夫人 来来来
Come on...

570
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:11,850
戚夫人加油
Go for it, Madam Qi...

571
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:15,520
夫人用力
Harder...

572
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:41,600
这是什么东西呀
What is that?

573
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:46,560
这位大哥
Excuse me...

574
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,600
请问这个是怎么用的
what is this for?

575
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:50,350
这个是脚踩上去
Put your feet inside,

576
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,480
两手扶着
and hold the handle like this.

577
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:52,770
这个叫什么
What is it called?

578
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,890
这个叫泥马
A mud horse.

579
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,610
在泥中可以行走自如
You can walk in the mud.

580
00:44:58,290 --> 00:44:59,190
泥马
Mud horse?

581
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:00,230
这个有意思呀
Very interesting.

582
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:02,390
去体验一下吧 很好玩的
Give it a try. It's a lot fun.

583
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,020
怎么会有这么多人在打架
Why are these people fighting?

584
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:23,190
是啊
Exactly!

585
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:26,810
那边有官差呀
The magistrate is over there.

586
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:30,180
平时就是贪生怕死 你这个混蛋
You're such a coward...

587
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:31,640
他为什么不管
Why doesn't he stop them?

588
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:35,980
卑职义乌县令赵大河
Generals, I'm Zhao Dahe,

589
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,150
拜见戚将军 卢将军
the county magistrate of Yiwu.

590
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:41,150
赵大人 这些村民为何打斗
Why are these people fighting?

591
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:42,640
二位有所不知呀
You don't understand.

592
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,690
义乌这地一向贫瘠
Yiwu has always been poor and barren.

593
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,520
可最近有老百姓发现了一些金矿
But the folks have discovered a gold mine lately

594
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,440
和一些金属的矿
along with other metal ores.

595
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,320
他们称这边为八宝山
People started calling this area Treasure Hill.

596
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:54,810
附近永康的村民一听说了 就来探矿
Villagers from Yongkang came to mine the ores

597
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,980
这不 两方面就打起来了
and the parties started to fight.

598
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:59,060
早些天还来过一次了
They came several days ago

599
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:01,730
已经被义乌的村民给打退了
and the villagers from Yiwu fought them off.

600
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,110
这两天不 又来第二次
But they keep coming back.

601
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:36,600
胡大人
Commander!

602
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:51,810
胡大人
Commander!

603
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:54,440
我在义乌发现了可练之兵
I found men in Yiwu I can train.

604
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:56,650
我正找你呢
Just the man I want.

605
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:03,560
自己好好看看吧
Take a look at this.

606
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,270
说我拉拢赵文华
It says here I kiss up to Zhao Wenhua,

607
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:13,440
靠权术取代张经大人
replaced Zhang Jing through political trickery

608
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:16,860
出谋献计把他害死
and eventually devised a ploy to murder him.

609
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,940
都是你元敬说的话吗
Did you say that?

610
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:31,930
若不是锦衣卫的弟兄们都被我收买了
If I didn't pay off the Imperial Secret Service

611
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,400
这话传到赵大人的耳中
and they managed to report this to Zhen Wenhua,

612
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:40,320
你早就和张经大人同一个下场了
you'd suffer the same fate as Zhang Jing.

613
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:55,690
我争官是真的
No doubt I was after his position,

614
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:58,900
但是杀死张经大人
but killing Zhang Jing

615
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:00,850
非我之意
was not my idea.

616
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:06,850
说我背弃道义
They say I was treacherous

617
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:09,810
诱劝王直投诚
and convinced Wang Zhi to surrender.

618
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,140
也非我所愿呀
That was not my idea either.

619
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:26,820
我何尝不想当一个
Don't you think I want to be

620
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,570
言而有信的大丈夫
a man of his word?

621
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:37,320
如果我真的能有掌控这一切
If only the situation was under my control,

622
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:40,520
那倭寇之患早就不战而退了
the pirates problem would be resolved without going to war.

623
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:58,060
元敬呀 元敬
Jiguang,

624
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,270
耳目众多呀
the walls have ears.

625
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:04,470
朝廷之事
With regards to the Imperial Court,

626
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:07,230
不是你随随便便就可以去谈论的
it's best you keep your opinions to yourself.

627
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:12,440
练兵打仗你是奇才
You're a genius in commanding and training your troops,

628
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:14,600
但是做官
but when it comes to politics,

629
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:18,020
你还真的好好学学
you have so much to learn.

630
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,320
听说你要换兵是吗
You want a new army?

631
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:28,180
这一笔钱呢
This money

632
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:33,230
本来是用作你官升一位的礼金
was supposed to buy you a promotion.

633
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:38,190
但是我猜 你肯定是想把这笔钱
But I guess you'd rather use it

634
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:40,770
用到义乌的练兵之用了
to train soldiers in Yiwu.

635
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:46,640
好了
Very well!

636
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:49,230
兵的事
I'll leave the Army

637
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:51,520
就交给你了
in your capable hands.

638
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:06,310
谢大人
Thank you, sir!

639
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:50,100
诸位义乌村民 听我说
Listen to me, folks.

640
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:53,350
我们这一次是来征兵打仗的 去打倭寇
We're recruiting soldiers to fight pirates.

641
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:54,860
我什么也不知道
I don't know.

642
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:56,430
反正大家去 我就去
You go, I go.

643
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:57,900
我给大家念念
Let me read this for you.

644
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,850
只要是臂膀腰…
With strong arms...

645
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:03,310
骗人的
Liar!

646
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:06,230
骗人的
Liar!

647
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:09,400
赵大河
Zhao Dahe,

648
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,980
你收了永康的人多少好处
how much did Yongkang village pay you

649
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:14,020
来骗我的人去当兵
to con us into joining the army

650
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:16,020
让人家来抢我们的矿
so they can steal our mines?

651
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:17,100
你胡说什么
Watch your mouth!

652
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:19,060
谁敢抛下义乌去当兵的
Whoever leaves Yiwu to join the Army

653
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,020
就是跟我结仇
is my enemy.

654
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:23,520
都听到没有
Hear that?

655
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:24,770
谁都不准去
No one is leaving.

656
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:31,610
听我再讲 跟大家聊一聊
Listen to me...

657
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,440
别紧张别紧张
Relax!

658
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:51,360
我们是找大成有事
We came to see Dacheng.

659
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:54,730
这边请
This way...

660
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:57,430
大成呀 大成
Dacheng“.

661
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:00,770
戚将军找你有要事相商呀
General Qi wants a word with you.

662
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,020
请
Please

663
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:03,480
走吧
Go away!

664
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:05,440
别再烦了
Leave me alone!

665
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:08,060
打仗是你们当兵的事
Going to war is your business.

666
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,430
这打倭寇是我们所有人的事呀
Fighting pirates is everyone's business.

667
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:13,390
大成兄
Dacheng,

668
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:15,190
没人愿意打仗呀
no one wants to go to war.

669
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:17,770
可是如果有人来侵犯咱们
In the face of an invasion,

670
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:19,810
咱们可得保护自己家园呀
we must fight to protect our homes.

671
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:21,400
这个道理你应该懂
You must know that.

672
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:22,680
我呸
Damn!

673
00:52:23,370 --> 00:52:24,470
我们矿被抢的时候
When they came to rob us,

674
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:25,350
你们在哪
where were you?

675
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:29,940
男人说大事你懂什么呀
Don't butt in, this is man talk.

676
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:31,270
加水
More water.

677
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:36,610
对呀
She's right.

678
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:39,360
我们矿被抢的时候你们在哪
Where were you when they robbed us?

679
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,310
你们当兵的
As a soldier,

680
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,270
怎么不保护我们呢
why didn't you protect us?

681
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,020
我们在打倭寇
We were busy fighting pirates.

682
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:52,100
否则 来抢你们矿的就不是永康的村民
Or else villagers from Yongkang won't be robbing you.

683
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:53,570
而是倭寇了
It would be the pirates.

684
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:55,520
你们能抵挡得了吗
Can you fight them off?

685
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:01,440
如果你们愿意跟着我干
If you follow me,

686
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,690
我会派军队来保护你们的矿
I'll send the Army to protect your mines.

687
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:07,480
好奇怪呀你
You're funny!

688
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,430
本来就有兵
You already have an Army.

689
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:10,900
来找我干嘛
What do you want with us?

690
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,730
因为你们都是好汉
Because you are good men.

691
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:17,520
看你说话口甜舌滑的
You're such a smooth talker.

692
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:19,650
你是不是男人呀
Are you even a man?

693
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:21,360
看你蛮不讲理 你才不是男人
You're being unreasonable. You must not be a man.

694
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:40,970
大成
Dacheng,

695
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,610
我要给你讲什么道理 你才会答应我呢
what will it take for you to say yes?

696
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,110
拳头
Your fists.

697
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:57,980
我只懂拳头
That's all I know.

698
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:00,640
奉陪
I'm happy to oblige.

699
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:18,440
我拳头舒服吗
How do you like my fists?

700
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,310
你的手没事吧
How is your hand?

701
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:19,860
承让
Thank you, I won.

702
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:21,680
承让什么
Says who?

703
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:22,930
我还没输呢
I have not yet lost!

704
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:01,390
继续跑呀
Keep running!

705
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:19,600
过来帮忙 救人呀
Give me a hand!

706
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:32,480
好了 不用送了
No need to walk us out.

707
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,980
过几天我带他们过去
I'll bring them to you in a few days.

708
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:36,110
好
Great!

709
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,230
你答应的事要做到
You must keep your word.

710
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,320
当然
Of course!

711
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:42,480
如果有人敢来抢你们的矿
If anyone tries to steal your mines,

712
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,560
我戚继光第一个来护着
I'll be the first to protect them.

713
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:47,440
大成 你大可放心
Don't worry, Dacheng.

714
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:50,100
这戚将军可是一言九鼎呀
General Qi is a man of his word.

715
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:52,900
戚将军
General Qi,

716
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:54,350
果然英明
you're so brilliant.

717
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:58,600
这真是两全其美的好方案吶
This is a win-win solution.

718
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:01,570
你也跟我们一起去
You should come with us.

719
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:03,640
我们上战场
We're going onto the battlefield;

720
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:05,730
你怎么在这里舒服的当官呀
you shouldn't be here doing a cushy job.

721
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:07,520
就是呀 你得去呀
That's right. You must come with us.

722
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:10,940
这 赵某人可是文人
I'm a scholar.

723
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:13,270
在战场上打打杀杀
I have no business

724
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:15,100
不是我的事呀
fighting in the battlefield.

725
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:17,150
打倭寇是大家的事呀
Fighting pirates is everyone's business.

726
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:18,100
你说的呀
You said that yourself.

727
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:19,230
去呀去不去呀
Are you coming or not?

728
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:23,940
赵大人
Magistrate,

729
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,390
您最了解义乌的民情了
nobody knows Yiwu better than you.

730
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:29,020
如果有您出面当我们的军监
You're best suited

731
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,560
是最合适不过的
to be the Army prefect.

732
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:36,970
好
Great!

733
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:40,980
只要你们愿意随..  随戚将军去当军
If you're willing to follow General Qi,

734
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:44,980
我赵某人
I, Zhao Dahe,

735
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,400
愿舍命相陪
am willing to risk my life

736
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:47,810
舍命相陪
and go wherever you go!

737
00:57:47,950 --> 00:57:48,600
好
Good!

738
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,980
接下来会为大家讲解地图
Let me explain the map to you.

739
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,850
来看看你训练的新军
I came to see your new Army.

740
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:02,690
这就是你们的家义乌
This is your home, Yiwu.

741
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,350
我们这里是新河
We're in Xinhe.

742
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:06,270
为什么义乌怎么这么小
Why is Yiwu so small?

743
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:07,940
地图嘛
It's only a map.

744
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:09,850
小心 小心
Be careful...

745
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:12,900

Look!

746

这个东西叫做狼筅
This bamboo spear is called Wolf Brush.

747
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:17,930
不懂了吧
You don't understand?

748
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:19,110
把那个给我
Pass me that...

749
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:22,140
这使用的时候
When you use this,

750
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,770
我们要把它架着
insert the branches and leaves.

751
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:26,860
这次你们再看看
Look again.

752
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:28,020
看起来好奇怪
Looks weird, right?

753
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:39,390
停
Stop!

754
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:41,730
大家等一下
Let's wait!

755
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:43,400
大家原地休息
Take a break on the spot.

756
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:51,650
当兵还要整天跑步的
Why do we have to run?

757
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:54,190
行军呀 没气行什么军
You need strength.

758
00:58:54,450 --> 00:58:55,230
怎么打
How else can you fight?

759
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:56,890
我以前没感觉那么累
I have never been this tired before.

760
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:00,600
楼将军
General Lou!

761
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:03,480
我和大家一起去训练
I've been practicing with you.

762
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:05,520
我能够有一套军服吗
Can I have an army uniform?

763
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:08,980
小鬼 你可别忘了
Don't forget

764

你可是胡大人的人啊

765
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:12,900
我们哪敢送你
We wouldn't dare give it to you.

766
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:16,810
还可以吗
Can you manage?

767
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:17,890
行
Yes.

768
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:19,810
继续
Carry on!

769
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:20,930
只要你不放弃
If you won't give up,

770
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,110
我们就不放弃你
we won't give up on you.

771
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:22,980
好
Good!

774
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,520
万众一心兮
If we stand united,

775
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:29,440
群山可撼
we can bring down the mountains.

776
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:31,070
惟忠与义兮
If we are loyal and patriotic,

777
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:32,820
气冲斗牛
we can ward off all obstacles.

778
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,440
主将亲我兮
The General cares about us

779

胜如父母
like our parents.

780
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:37,940
干犯军法兮
If we break the rules,

781
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,850
身不自由
we shall be punished.

782
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:41,310
号令明兮
If we obey direct orders,

783
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:42,900
赏罚信
reward and punishment shall be fair.

784
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:44,360
赴水火兮
We go through fire and water

785
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:46,110
敢迟留
without hesitation.

786
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,560
上报天子兮
We serve His Majesty

787
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:49,350
下救黔首
and save the people.

788
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:50,820
杀尽倭奴兮
Kill pirates

789
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,570
觅个封侯
and seek titles.

790
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:00,480
举刀
Raise your sabers!

791
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:02,690
收
Back!

792
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:44,640
万众一心兮
If we stand united,

793
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:46,190
群山可撼

刚才我去拜访唐顺之唐大人

聊得一时兴起就忘了时间了
We had a nice visit and forgot the time.

805
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:23,900

806
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:25,100

这些菜都凉了

821
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:56,970
小牟

01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:58,600
把菜都撤了

01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:14,690
不就回来晚了一点嘛
I'm just a little late for dinner.

827
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:17,150
没必要把事情闹大吧
There's no need to make such a fuss.

828
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:19,730
我闹了吗
Did I?

829
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:24,100
戚将军家宴客
General Qi is entertaining at home.

830
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:25,860
就不该待慢客人
We must not be rude.

831
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:33,720
你是在跟我发脾气吗
Are you picking a fight?

832
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:40,270
夫人
Stop it!

833
01:02:59,290 --> 01:03:00,270
先告退了
We should go.

834
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:02,390
消消气我哥不好 他不好
It's his fault.

835
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:05,400
先走了
I better leave.

836
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:13,890
我跟你们说
Listen to me,

837
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:15,730
以后戚将军的事情

838
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:17,650
就是我们大家的事情啊

839
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:18,820
女人呀
Women!

840
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:21,020
是要挫她一下威风
You must put her in her place.

841
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:24,060
你要告诉她谁才是一家之主
Let her know who's in charge.

842
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:25,770
你要告诉她
You must tell her.

843
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:26,940
你心狠了
Be tough.

844
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,350
忍无可忍
Don't take it anymore.

845
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:30,190
老虎
Even a tiger

846
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:32,440
也有睡觉的时候呀
will fall asleep.

847
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:34,690
你待她睡觉了
When she's asleep,

848
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:37,480
拿把刀 架她脖子上
put a knife to her neck.

849
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,730
叫她起来 然后再告诉她
Wake her up and tell her

850
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:42,520
你要是还不服的话
if she refuses to obey,

851
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,940
大不了先杀了你再自尽
you'll kill her.

852
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,150
以振夫纲
You must subjugate her.

853
01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:48,020
好
Yes!

854
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:51,060
大成说得好 这话说真对
Hear, hear! Dacheng is right!

855
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:52,350
哥我们就这么办
That's what we should do.

856
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,270
夫人
My dear...

857
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:39,110
为什么拿着剑
What are you doing with the sword?

858
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:51,020
我想杀只鸡给夫人补补身子
I want to kill a chicken for you as a tonic.

859
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:08,970
你的剑怎么用来杀鸡呢
Your sword should not be used to kill a chicken.

860
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:26,520
大成
Dacheng,

861
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:29,480
谁请夫人过来的
who invited my wife?

862
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:31,270
将军不敢自己出手
We know you couldn't do it.

863
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,440
我们兄弟们愿意为你出手
We decided to do it for you.

864
01:05:34,450 --> 01:05:35,770
等一会掷杯为号
Drop the cup as our signal,

865
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:37,850
我们几个人一起用刀架她
we'll hold her at knife point.

866
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:39,220
你什么都不用多说
You don't need to say anything.

867
01:05:39,410 --> 01:05:40,310
我们来说就好
We'll do the talking for you.

868
01:05:40,450 --> 01:05:41,680
没事的 你放心
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

869
01:05:41,790 --> 01:05:43,190
夫人来了来了来了
Here she comes...

870
01:05:50,330 --> 01:05:50,930
相公
Jiguang,

871
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:52,850
有什么要紧的事呀
what's so urgent

872
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,520
非得叫我现在过来
that I must come over right away?

873
01:05:58,950 --> 01:05:59,480
戚夫人
Madam Qi.

874
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:03,060
奉茶
Serve tea.

875
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:11,150
嫂子
Sister.

876
01:06:14,290 --> 01:06:15,270
怎么了你们
What's wrong?

877
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:16,690
为什么都怪怪的
You're all acting weird.

878
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:19,440
戚将军
General Qi!

879
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:21,730
茶
Your tea...

880
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,430
到底出什么事了
What's going on?

881
01:07:04,410 --> 01:07:05,360
夫人
My dear,

882
01:07:07,830 --> 01:07:10,860
想请你看看我们练兵的状况
I want you to watch our training

883
01:07:11,290 --> 01:07:12,230
给点意见
and give us some advice.

884
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:21,900
我哪懂这些
I don't know anything about that.

885
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:23,390
就阅兵
Just review the troops.

886
01:07:25,290 --> 01:07:25,980
阅兵
Review the troops.

887
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:29,770
阅兵好
Good idea!

888
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:31,600
我去准备
I'll go get ready.

889
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:33,940
听到了
You heard him.

890
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:35,930
阅兵
Review the troops.

891
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:38,890
走了
Let's go.

892
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:40,860
走了
Let's go.

893
01:07:45,290 --> 01:07:48,060
戚将军是个好榜样呀
General Qi set a good example.

894
01:07:49,910 --> 01:07:50,730
等等
Wait!

895
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:52,350
不是这你也在记下来呀
Don't write that down!

896
01:07:52,450 --> 01:07:54,100
这是史 历史呀
It's part of history.

897
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:57,150
什么史 你给我撕了
What history? Tear that up!

898
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:13,390
木幡的狼人部队已出发到宁海了
Kohata's ronins already set out for Ninghai.

899
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:19,600
才三千一百三十四人
They have 3,134 men.

900
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,320
戚继光的军队不管多精良
Regardless of how effective Qi's troops are,

901
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:25,610
将军也不用这样忧心吧
there's no need for you to worry.

902
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:28,600
听说要当他兵的人
I heard he set strict criteria for his recruits.

903
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:32,030
大城里生活的不收 当过官的不收
No one from the big city or has been in office.

904
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:36,810
皮肤白的不收 胆子小的不行
No one with fair complexion, no cowards.

905
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:40,220
胆子大又不可以
Nobody too daring either.

906
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:42,020
这样子
Just imagine,

907
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:45,020
这些是什么人呀
what kind of people would he end up with?

908
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:49,190
就是笨的人呀
Fools!

909
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:53,810
不笨的不敢带呢
He'll end up commanding fools.

910
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,900
岑港之战
At the battle of Cengang,

911
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:02,610
我们是能够完全打败他们
we have the ability to defeat them.

912
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,480
但老师却不让我们继续应战
But Sensei won't let us engage them.

913
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:09,180
如果那个时候我们继续应战
Had we done that back then,

914
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:12,480
我们今天根本就不用担心戚继光
we wouldn't have to worry about Qi today.

915
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:19,060
少主你是在批评我吗
Are you criticizing me?

916
01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:25,900
我不明白
I don't understand.

917
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:29,070
我们结集了两万大军
We have 20,000 men.

918
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:32,690
只要直接进攻台州
If we attack Taizhou directly,

919
01:09:33,330 --> 01:09:36,280
到时候戚继光一定跟我们对战
Qi will have to engage us

920
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,650
然后把他击败就可以了
and we can defeat him.

921
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:41,360
如今却兵分三路
Why split the Army three ways?

922
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:44,530
同时攻击宁海台州又有什么意义呢
What's the use of attacking Ninghai and Taizhou simultaneously?

923
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,480
意义是在于必胜
To ensure a sure win.

924
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:54,110
派浪人部队到宁海
Sending the ronins to Ninghai

925
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:58,230
是要让戚继光的兵走一天的路去迎战
will make Qi's troops travel one day to fight.

926
01:09:58,790 --> 01:10:05,100
而我们在他迎击浪人的时候 进攻台州
We take Taizhou while they're engaged with the ronins.

927
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:06,980
那新河呢
What about Xinhe?

928
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:09,810
攻一个空的军营又是为什么
What's the point of attacking an empty barrack?

929
01:10:18,450 --> 01:10:23,480
戚继光和他军队的家人 都在新河呀
Qi and his troops' families are in Xinhe.

930
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:28,390
保护战地
Between defending the land

931
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:31,520
还是保护家人
and protecting their families,

932
01:10:33,910 --> 01:10:36,480
你说他们会选哪一个
how would they choose?

933
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:42,560
无论他怎样选择
Whatever they choose to do,

934
01:10:43,290 --> 01:10:48,350
都会是个很有趣的局面
it'll be a very interesting situation.

935
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:53,820
我们就在这里等他上钩
We'll wait for them to take the bait.

936
01:10:56,870 --> 01:11:00,430
过去倭寇来犯从来没有超过三千人
Pirates never brought more than 3,000 men.

937
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:01,980
而这次
But this time,

938
01:11:02,910 --> 01:11:04,560
在奉化附近登岸的
20,000 pirates

939
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:06,440
倭寇近有两万之众
landed near Fenghua.

940
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:08,680
元敬
Jiguang,

941
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,770
你的新兵只有三千
your new Army only has 3,000 men.

942
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:12,190
怎么去迎战
How can you fight them?

943
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,020
胡大人
Commander,

944
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:17,230
你这是送羊入虎口
you are sending sheep to a tiger.

945
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:18,930
卢大人
General Lu,

946
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:20,400
我们可不是羊吶
we're not sheep.

947
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:21,650
你别逞强
Don't get in over your head.

948
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:23,940
那还要再等多长时间呀
How much longer must we wait?

949
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:26,940
多等一天
The longer we wait,

950
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:28,980
老百姓就要多受一天的苦
the longer our people will suffer.

951
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:31,850
绝对不能让贼倭再深入下去了
We must stop the pirates' threat.

952
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:36,470
其他同僚
Does anyone else

953
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:39,570
真的没有一点对策了吗
have any counter measures?

954
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:54,230
倭兵在宁海集结不动
Japanese soldiers congregated in Ninghai but made no moves

955
01:11:54,950 --> 01:11:57,230
就是要引你上钩呀
because they want you to take the bait.

956
01:11:57,790 --> 01:11:59,190
我愿意上这个钩
I'm willing to take the bait.

957
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:03,070
如果我不上钩 对方就不会动
If I don't, they won't make a move.

958
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:06,150
上次岑港之战我们知道
The battle of Cengang tells us

959
01:12:06,410 --> 01:12:08,560
对方有个懂兵法的人在调度
they have military strategists among them.

960
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:11,020
这次很可能是同一批人
It's probably the same group.

961
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:13,270
我建议
I suggest

962
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:16,440
台州 象山的兵马按兵不动
troops in Taizhou and Xiangshan should lay low

963
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:18,680
以防他们乘虚而入
to ensure the pirates can't take advantage of our weak defense.

964
01:12:19,290 --> 01:12:21,560
我愿意率领新军先打头阵
I'll take the lead with the new Army.

965
01:12:22,330 --> 01:12:24,180
等探明对方的意图之后
When we find out their real motive,

966
01:12:24,370 --> 01:12:25,940
再请大人定夺
we'll let Commander Hu make a ruling.

967
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:27,140
这次
This time,

968
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:29,560
绝对不能让他们再跑了
we won't let them get away again.

969
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:34,440
好
Good!

970
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:36,770
元敬
Jiguang,

971
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:40,100
马上领军到宁海
set out for Ninghai right away.

972
01:12:40,910 --> 01:12:41,810
卢将军
General Lu,

973
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:45,310
你呢 随我到台州坐镇
we'll take command of Taizhou.

974
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:46,680
其余部队
The rest of the troops

975
01:12:47,290 --> 01:12:49,390
原地待命 加强防守
will stay put and beef up defense

976
01:12:49,790 --> 01:12:50,770
听候指令
pending our new order.

977
01:12:52,330 --> 01:12:53,520
大人英明
Good idea, Commander!

978
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,100
大人英明
Good idea!

979
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,940
不用你们打就是英明了 啊
Because you're not doing the fighting.

980
01:13:02,370 --> 01:13:03,570
就这么决定了
So be it.

981
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:11,650
听说
I heard

982
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:14,730
对方来了两万兵
the enemy has 20,000 men.

983
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:18,360
别挂念
Don't worry!

984
01:13:19,410 --> 01:13:20,560
谢谢夫人
Thank you.

985
01:13:26,910 --> 01:13:28,060
两万
20,000 men.

986
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:30,100
两万的倭寇
20,000 pirates.

987
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:32,270
这仗能打得赢吗
Can we beat them?

988
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:35,030
上次我们两万人打了一千倭寇
Last time we outnumbered them 20,000 to 1,000

989
01:13:35,450 --> 01:13:36,980
打了半年都没打完
and the war dragged on for 6 months.

990
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:38,610
等等吧
Just wait.

991
01:13:42,410 --> 01:13:44,390
这帮人还不知道自己要去送死吗
Don't they know they're on a suicide mission?

992
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,270
还威风呢
And they look so confident.

993
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:50,600
说什么了
What did you say?

994
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:52,270
有本事你去呀
I'd like to see you take their place.

995
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:56,890
你们天天个个胆小鬼一样在这里耗着
You're a bunch of cowards hanging out here.

996
01:13:57,250 --> 01:13:58,270
有本事上战场
Why don't you go to the frontline?

997
01:13:58,330 --> 01:13:59,810
有什么权利说别人
You have no right to criticize.

998
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:03,520
筷子
Chopsticks!

999
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:06,610
胆小鬼
Cowards!

1000
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,900
爹
Father!

1001
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:12,900
慢点慢点
Slow down...

1002
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:42,270
爹很快回来
We have to leave.

1003
01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:00,140
好走
Go...

1004
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:22,060
头
Chief!

1005
01:15:22,410 --> 01:15:26,850
他们不会要我们去送死吧
Are they sending us on a suicide mission?

1006
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:28,150
你这么怕死呀
Are you afraid to die?

1007
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:29,480
怎么可能有这种事
How is this possible?

1008
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:31,730
明军可以厉害到什么地步啊
How formidable is the Ming Army?

1009
01:15:34,370 --> 01:15:36,100
我们现在是最大的威胁
We're their biggest threat.

1010
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:38,270
不过
But...

1011
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:40,020
我担心的是
I'm more worried

1012
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,940
他们一看见我们的身影
when they get a glimpse of us,

1013
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:45,480
卷着尾巴就逃跑了
they'll run with their tails between their legs.

1014
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:50,650
哎呀
Oh

1015
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:53,100
我缺女人呀
I need women.

1016
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:57,230
想起都觉得兴奋
The thought of them makes me excited.

1017
01:15:57,790 --> 01:16:00,110
明军快来
The Ming Army is coming!

1018
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:03,770
快快打完我便去宁海找美女
Finish them off and I'll get a woman in Ninghai.

1019
01:16:03,790 --> 01:16:04,980
说的对
Absolutely!

1020
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:08,360
傻瓜 女人和钱
If you want women and money,

1021
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:10,230
当然都去台州
go to Taizhou.

1022
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:13,440
台州才是大城
They have things that can satisfy us.

1023
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,820
我缺钱呀
I need money.

1024
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:19,860
打完这一仗赶紧向大人要报酬吧
Ask for our reward after this.

1025
01:16:20,330 --> 01:16:22,810
想回家了
I want to go home.

1026
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:24,470
头
Chief!

1027
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:26,310
明军就在前面了
The Ming Army is up ahead.

1028
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:29,270

去吧
Go!

1030
01:16:41,290 --> 01:16:42,770
头来来来
Come on, Chief...

1031
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,190
做个将军的样子
act like a general.

1032
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:46,850
将军
General?

1033
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:48,310
这么好
This is great!

1034
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:55,190
出阵
Let's go!

1035
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:57,650
出阵
Let's go!

1036
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:15,360
不是说有两万的吗
Didn't they say 20,000 men?

1037
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:17,730
先别想那么多
Never mind that.

1038
01:17:18,330 --> 01:17:20,100
命令大家从两翼展开
Tell the others to split up.

1039
01:17:20,290 --> 01:17:21,140
小心有埋伏
Watch out for ambush.

1040
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:21,980
是
Aye!

1041
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:23,810

开枪
Fire!

1047
01:18:03,910 --> 01:18:05,020
冲呀
Charge!

1048
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:34,390

Stop!

1049
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:42,480

1053
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:12,940

Get down!

1054
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:14,350
开火
Fire!

1055
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:17,310
发生什么事
What's going on?

1056
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:20,690
退吧 退吧
Fall back!

1057
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:28,720
退吧…
Back up...

1058
01:19:31,410 --> 01:19:36,150
"Over 300 pirates died while only a few Ming soldiers were injured."

1059
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:37,020
哥
Jiguang!

1060
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:39,980
胡大人派兵来报
A message from Commander Hu.

1061
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,480
新河附近发现倭兵
Japanese soldiers in Xinhe!

1062
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:44,820
大成哥
Dacheng!

1063
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:46,810
倭兵攻打我们家了
Japanese soldiers attacked our homes.

1064
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,070
什么 你说什么
What did you say?

1065
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:51,690
攻打我们家了 倭兵
Japanese soldiers attacked our homes.

1066
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:53,400
大哥 怎么办
What should we do?

1067
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:56,390
戚将军
General Qi,

1068
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:57,900
倭寇攻打到新河了
the pirates went after Xinhe.

1069
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:59,310
我们赶快回去吧
Let's hurry back.

1070
01:19:59,910 --> 01:20:01,390
对呀我们赶快回去吧
That's right! Let's go!

1071
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:04,190
回去吧
Let's go back!

1072
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:09,060
大家可别给倭寇骗了
Don't let them fool you.

1073
01:20:09,410 --> 01:20:11,020
他们大老远来
You think they came all this way

1074
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:12,440
难道只为了新河吗
to take Xinhe?

1075
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:13,400
新河
Xinhe

1076
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:14,560
那里有我们的亲人呀
is where our families are.

1077
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:16,650
对呀是呀 亲人都在那儿呢
Yes, our families are there.

1078
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:18,180
来来来 过来
Come over here...

1079
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:19,470
过来看看
Look!

1080
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:22,640
大家看
Take a look,

1081
01:20:23,330 --> 01:20:25,180
一队在宁海出现
Ningha...

1082
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,570
一队在新河出现
Xinhe...

1083
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:28,850
为什么
Why?

1084
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:31,070
为了就是掩饰他们的目标
To cover up their real target.

1085
01:20:31,790 --> 01:20:32,560
台州
Taizhou.

1086
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:34,890
台州可是城府
Taizhou is the provincial capital.

1087
01:20:35,370 --> 01:20:36,470
对倭寇来讲
To the pirates,

1088
01:20:36,830 --> 01:20:38,650
那里才大有价值
it's worth a lot more.

1089
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:39,640
哥
Jiguang,

1090
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:41,440
可是嫂子在新河
your wife is there.

1091
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:44,320
就是因为她在我才不担心
She's precisely the reason I'm not worried.

1092
01:20:45,370 --> 01:20:47,650
新河现在驻军就剩两百人
Only 200 men are stationed in Xinhe.

1093
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:48,770
怎么行
That's not enough.

1094
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:50,820
两百足够了
That's quite enough.

1095
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:52,690
别忘了
Don't forget,

1096
01:20:52,830 --> 01:20:54,900
我夫人可是天下无敌啊
my wife is invincible.

1097
01:20:59,290 --> 01:21:00,060
要不这样
How about...

1098
01:21:00,370 --> 01:21:01,020
楼楠
Lou Nan!

1099
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:04,230
你带领一半兵马先赶回去救援
Take half the troops with you back to Xinhe.

1100
01:21:04,370 --> 01:21:07,190
之后再赶回台州跟我们会合
Then meet us in Taizhou.

1101
01:21:07,790 --> 01:21:08,520
大成哥
Dacheng,

1102
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:09,730
都说保家卫国
we should protect our homes and defend our state.

1103
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:11,310
家都保不了 谈什么卫国
But without a home, who cares about the state?

1104
01:21:11,330 --> 01:21:11,900
闭嘴
Shut up!

1105
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:14,810
戚将军都不担心
If General Qi is not worried,

1106
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:16,270
你们担心什么呀
why should you be?

1107
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:17,350
去
Go!

1108
01:21:17,870 --> 01:21:18,820
我们准备出发
Get ready to leave.

1109
01:21:18,950 --> 01:21:19,600
大成哥
Dacheng“.

1110
01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:20,520
去啊
Go!

1111
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:21,600
走
Come on...

1112
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:28,020
将军
General,

1113
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,390
我军只有三千兵
we only have 3,000 men.

1114
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,470
现在还一分为二
If we split the troops in half,

1115
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:34,610
倭军人马两万呀
can we take on

1116
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:36,100
可行吗
20,000 Japanese soldiers?

1117
01:21:36,410 --> 01:21:37,480
不行也得行
We'll have to.

1118
01:21:37,870 --> 01:21:39,020
台州不能失
We can't lose Taizhou.

1119
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:42,770
大家的家眷可都托付给你了
Our families are in your good hands.

1120
01:21:43,410 --> 01:21:44,140
哥
Jiguang,

1121
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:47,730
我们先去新河再去台州 也赶得及
we can still make Taizhou in time after Xinhe.

1122
01:21:48,410 --> 01:21:49,140
闭嘴
Shut up!

1123
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,190
你再多说一个字
Another word out of you,

1124
01:21:51,370 --> 01:21:52,270
我先斩你
I'll have you beheaded.

1125
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:55,690
好
Very well.

1126
01:21:55,910 --> 01:21:56,560
将军
General,

1127
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:58,320
你放心
rest assured

1128
01:21:59,330 --> 01:22:00,900
如果新河有什么闪失
if anything happens to Xinhe,

1129
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:02,060
我楼楠
Lou Nan

1130
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:04,020
不会活着回来见你
will not come back alive.

1131
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:05,350
拜托了
Thank you.

1132
01:22:12,620 --> 01:22:14,020
来 把东西全都装起来
Pack up everything.

1133
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:15,900
能拿走的东西快拿走
Take whatever we can.

1134
01:22:16,370 --> 01:22:17,220
动作快点
On the double...

1135
01:22:22,830 --> 01:22:23,980
快 走
Go...

1136
01:22:28,330 --> 01:22:29,270
戚夫人
Madam Qi,

1137
01:22:29,790 --> 01:22:31,480
我怎么就跟你说不明白了
why can't you understand?

1138
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:34,400
这上万的倭兵马上要到新河城了
Over 10,000 Japanese soldiers will be in Xinhe soon.

1139
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:37,770
我们已经派人去找戚将军去了
I already sent a message to General Qi.

1140
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:40,730
你现在听我的赶紧收拾精致细软
Listen to me and pack your things.

1141
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:42,600
卑职送你出城
I'll escort you out of town.

1142
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:44,270
我们出城那新河怎么办
Then what will happen to Xinhe?

1143
01:22:46,830 --> 01:22:48,560
黄岩的乡兵
Village soldiers are

1144
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:51,400
和太平的乡兵现在就在城外抵抗
fighting outside the city right now.

1145
01:22:51,830 --> 01:22:53,520
这整个县衙之内
We have less than

1146
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:56,770
新河城之内就不到两百个衙役呀
200 soldiers in Xinhe,

1147
01:22:56,830 --> 01:22:57,930
- 能顶得…  - 戚夫人
- how can... - Madam Qi!

1148
01:22:58,250 --> 01:22:59,470
他们说倭寇来了
They say the pirates are coming.

1149
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:00,220
我们该怎么办
What should we do?

1150
01:23:00,290 --> 01:23:01,230
你看你看
See?

1151
01:23:06,410 --> 01:23:08,640
马上找人敲钟 召集全城老百姓
Sound the bell and summon everyone in town.

1152
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:10,690
走 赶紧
Let's go!

1153
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:12,310
小牟去把盔甲拿来
Xiao Mou, bring my armor.

1154
01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:13,980
你们要干什么
What are you doing?

1155
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:15,970
走走走赶紧
Hurry up...

1156
01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:17,400
这以为做假装的
You think this is a game?

1157
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,770
这是打仗要死人吶
We're going to war. People may die.

1158
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:21,690
倭寇你见过嘛 我见过
Have you seen a pirate? I have.

1159
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:23,560
我杀过
I killed some of them.

1160
01:23:25,910 --> 01:23:27,060
再不走就来不及了
Time is running out.

1161
01:23:39,290 --> 01:23:41,790
我是戚将军夫人
I am General Qi's wife.

1162
01:23:41,790 --> 01:23:44,770
我没有办法扔下新河的老百姓自己逃命
I cannot run away and abandon the people of Xinhe.

1163
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,190
你若想走
If you want to leave,

1164
01:23:46,950 --> 01:23:47,930
请自便
go ahead.

1165
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:53,900
我怎么就跟她说不明白了
Why can't I reason with her?

1166
01:23:58,330 --> 01:23:59,930
走走走
Let's go.

1167
01:24:03,790 --> 01:24:04,390
别走别走
Don't go!

1168
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:07,140
跑了也没有用
What's the use of running?

1169
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:08,520
还不如跟他们拼了吶
Might as well stay and fight.

1170
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:12,770
来来来
Come on...

1171
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:14,650
戚夫人带人来拿兵器了
Madam Qi came to get weapons.

1172
01:24:15,290 --> 01:24:17,440
不是说好了那有人把守的吗
Didn't we agree someone will guard the city?

1173
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:18,570
都给打晕了
They were knocked out cold.

1174
01:24:24,410 --> 01:24:25,230
夫人 你等一下
Wait up, Madam!

1175

1192
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:23,320
你们不怕死吗
You're not afraid to die?

我们又怎么能走呢

1196
01:25:33,290 --> 01:25:34,890
让后辈子孙笑呀

1197
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:38,560
你
You...

1198
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:39,430

去教他们三眼铳
Teach them how to use the hand cannons.

1200
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:42,350
来兄弟们

1201
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:43,770

01:26:22,950 --> 01:26:25,430
头他们更起劲了

1213
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:28,310
就让戚继光多活几个时辰吧
Let Qi live a few more hours.

1214
01:26:29,790 --> 01:26:31,730
自己部队中计都不知
He doesn't know he's walking into a trap.

1215
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:35,350
戚继光和老狐狸互打的时候
When he takes on the sly old fox,

1216
01:26:35,370 --> 01:26:37,100
我们在后面伏击

1217
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:40,180
妙计

1218
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:42,060
报告戚将军

the Japanese soldiers encamped in Huajie, 4 miles outside the city.

1220
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:47,640
城府中 胡大人和三千官兵已做好布防
Commander Hu and 3,000 men have already set up defense in the city.

1221
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:50,350
果然是台州
They're after Taizhou after all.

1222
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:53,070
敌军人数是多少
How many men do they have?

1223
01:26:53,370 --> 01:26:54,940
他们大概有八千到一万左右
Between 8,000 to 10,000.

1224
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,320
继美 军旗
Jimei! Banner!

1225
01:26:58,370 --> 01:26:58,810

Aye!

1226
01:27:00,330 --> 01:27:00,900

1227
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:06,060
把我的军旗交给台州城府的胡大人
Give this to Commander Hu.

1228
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:07,520
请他们挂起来
Ask him to hoist it.

1229
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:09,400
就说我马上回来取
Tell him I'll be back for it.

1230
01:27:09,750 --> 01:27:10,600
遵命

1231
01:27:11,830 --> 01:27:12,560

Let's go!

1232
01:27:22,450 --> 01:27:25,310
宁海的浪人部队已经被他打败
If ronins defeated him in Ninghai.

1233
01:27:25,790 --> 01:27:29,850
那我便让浪人去进攻台州
I'll let the ronins attack Taizhou

1234
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:34,100
我们的部队依然发毫不损
and our troops won't suffer any casualties.

1235
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:38,900
这太让人气馁了
That is so discouraging.

1236
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:46,060
只要除掉戚继光
Once we get rid of Qi,

1237
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:51,110
让明国放弃了建立强大军队的决心
Ming won't be so determined to build a strong army

1238
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:53,850
我们就可以胜利
and we'll have a chance to win.

1239
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:56,020

戚继光的军队出现在花街

有人跌入圈套了

1242

这样的阵型
What kind of formation is this?

1244
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:32,650
那是什么兵器
Look at those weapons.

1245
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:33,610
我没见过
I have never seen that before.

1246
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:34,900
你也没见过

1247
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:40,180
通知小田副将的部队 加入包围明军

大家往后退
Back up...

1262
01:29:37,910 --> 01:29:40,860
后面的盾阵快过来帮忙 给我顶住
Bring the shields forward!

1263
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:43,850
狼筅
Wolf Brushes!

1264
01:29:44,950 --> 01:29:46,520

01:30:21,830 --> 01:30:23,600
真的中计了
They're trapped.

1270
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:25,860
头 现在有什么行动
Chief, what do we do now?

1271

去找老狐狸
Let's go find the old fox.

1272
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:30,560

在东北角汇合

正自小巷向我们本阵方向进发

1290
01:31:55,540 --> 01:31:58,360
什么？戚继光吗

我们慎重的迎接他吧
Let's give him a warm welcome.

1292
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:13,180
要让他们回到大街
Drive them back to the main street

1293

1323
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:42,390
准备
Ready!

1324
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:44,940
杀
Charge!

1325
01:34:52,790 --> 01:34:53,810
盾牌
Shields!

1326
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:24,600
人家在立功
Others are contributing,

1327
01:35:27,250 --> 01:35:29,100
我们却在这里吹着风
while we're here shooting the breeze.

1328
01:35:32,750 --> 01:35:33,640
少主
Master Yamagawa,

1329
01:35:34,370 --> 01:35:36,100
虽然我不太清楚
maybe I don't understand,

1330
01:35:37,410 --> 01:35:39,480
但你不是应该才是主将吗
but I thought you were the commander.

1331
01:35:42,790 --> 01:35:43,860
为什么
Why?

1332
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,730
为什么我们不去头阵打
Why aren't we spearheading this campaign?

1333
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:49,020
如果是我们铁炮队打头阵的话
If we send in the Guns Unit,

1334
01:35:49,580 --> 01:35:52,180
一定能阻止戚继光前进
we can stop Qi's advances.

1335
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:55,440
那老狐狸 怕少主你有什么事
The old fox is worried if anything should happen to you,

1336
01:35:55,700 --> 01:35:57,480
回去会被主公怪责吧
your father may blame him.

1337
01:35:58,330 --> 01:36:01,110
但你不同
But it's different for you.

1338
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:05,070
什么人也能瞬间把他打倒
Anyone can topple him in an instant.

1339
01:36:05,750 --> 01:36:08,980
只要你的铁炮队跟我联手
If your Guns Unit join forces with me,

1340
01:36:09,910 --> 01:36:11,110
不管是谁
no matter who it is,

1341
01:36:11,580 --> 01:36:13,310
我们都能瞬间打倒
we can instantly take them out.

1342
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,570
我为报一战之仇
I want revenge,

1343
01:36:17,950 --> 01:36:20,280
你为建功成名去冲吧
while you want a reputation.

1344
01:36:32,410 --> 01:36:33,360
我啊
Me?

1345
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:37,770
我也想成为真正的武士
I want to be a genuine samurai.

1346
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:44,310
要当真正的武士
To be a samurai,

1347
01:36:45,410 --> 01:36:47,480
你别再奸淫掳掠了
you must stop your plundering and rape.

1348
01:36:47,830 --> 01:36:49,400
我当然知道
Of course I know that.

1349
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:50,820
还有
Also,

1350
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:56,180
我被你直话直说的性格感染了
I like your straight talk.

1351
01:36:58,500 --> 01:36:59,140
去吧
Let's do it.

1352
01:36:59,500 --> 01:36:59,970
好
Good!

1353
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:01,640
拿酒来
Bring us wine!

1354
01:37:02,620 --> 01:37:03,100
一起来
Come on!

1355
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,650
他们看像守着作战
They're guarding more than they are fighting.

1356
01:37:12,750 --> 01:37:16,230
被动攻击是他想出来的吗
He invented this passive attack?

1357
01:37:17,910 --> 01:37:20,060
他们都是人
They're humans after all.

1358
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:23,560
等太久会累的
Waiting too long will wear them out.

1359
01:37:23,660 --> 01:37:25,520
看他们还能等多久
They can't wait much longer.

1360
01:37:25,790 --> 01:37:27,810
别焦急继续不停攻击
Be patient and carry on with the attack.

1361
01:37:28,370 --> 01:37:31,070
如果找到突破位就攻进去吧
Make headway if you can find a breach.

1362
01:37:31,620 --> 01:37:32,320
是
Aye!

1363
01:37:32,450 --> 01:37:34,430
大家太累了 冲不过去
We're exhausted. We can't break through.

1364
01:37:34,620 --> 01:37:35,600
虎蹲炮呢
Where are the Crouching Tiger Cannons?

1365
01:37:35,620 --> 01:37:36,440
未追上
They can't keep up.

1366
01:37:36,790 --> 01:37:37,690
顶住
Hold them off!

1367
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:39,820
不要后退
Don't back off.

1368
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:41,600
往前冲
Charge forward!

1369
01:37:43,370 --> 01:37:44,190
怎么不通
We can't get through.

1370
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:45,430
前面给堵住了
The road ahead is blocked.

1371
01:37:45,540 --> 01:37:46,480
冲不出去呀
We can't get through.

1372
01:37:49,950 --> 01:37:51,350
来这边 快
Come this way. Hurry!

1373
01:37:55,410 --> 01:37:56,440
你能不能准一点
Can you aim better?

1374
01:37:56,540 --> 01:37:57,360
在打仗呀
We're at war!

1375
01:37:57,450 --> 01:37:58,770
方向就对了
This is the right direction.

1376
01:37:58,870 --> 01:37:59,520
往回走
Go back!

1377
01:37:59,830 --> 01:38:01,350
你拿着个破罗盘有什么用
Your broken compass is useless.

1378
01:38:02,330 --> 01:38:03,060
小心
Watch out!

1384

小鬼你怎么啦
What's wrong with you, kid?

1385
01:38:22,660 --> 01:38:24,020
你醒醒呀小鬼

1391
01:39:09,250 --> 01:39:11,600
这是在搞什么鬼呀
What the hell is this?

1392
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:16,390
我想少主只是想替你速战速决呢
He wants to help you wrap this up quickly.

1393
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:19,810
可拜托你替他守住后卫吗
Can you guard the back in his place?

1394
01:39:19,830 --> 01:39:21,020

Defeating 20,000 pirates with only 1,000 men

1407

has not been easy.

1408
01:41:50,750 --> 01:41:55,560
这代价 不少呀
A high price to pay.

1409

戚将军呢
Where is General Qi?

1410

戚将军领兵继续追剿倭寇
He went after the pirates.

1411
01:42:07,620 --> 01:42:08,940
那是倭兵的主力
They are the leaders of the pirates.

1412

不能让他们给跑了

I can't go home like this.

1510

你替我告诉主公

1511
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:16,730
明军已经建起来了
The Matsura clan

1512
01:53:17,370 --> 01:53:20,600
我们松蒲藩再不要妄想了

少主

1524
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:38,470
戚继光是怎么让明军脱胎换骨的呀
The Ming Army is reborn under Qi's command.

1525
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:42,020

1526
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:44,560
变得强大了

让他人相信自己变强大了

故兵无常势
The strength of an Army will change

1530
01:56:26,790 --> 01:56:28,360
水无常形
just like water will change its form.

1531
01:56:28,790 --> 01:56:34,570
能因敌变化而取胜者谓之神
He who can prevail in chaos is regarded as a god.

1532
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:49,690
戚将军说过不能杀降兵
General Qi said prisoners of war must be spared.

1533
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:51,390
不要管我

1534
01:57:51,540 --> 01:57:53,730

名字不重要
The name is not important.

1540
02:03:33,870 --> 02:03:35,520
我就是倭寇
Iam a pirate.

1541
02:04:02,080 --> 02:04:02,980
