1
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,660
一九三八年六月

2
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,370
在二十世纪三十年代，即使是像梅乔克力斯这样的大都市

3
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,240
也无法抵挡经济危机的冲击

4
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,450
那个时代充满了恐惧与迷惑

5
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,520
通知大众的工作

6
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,950
成为星球日报的责任

7
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,290
那份伟大的公众的报纸

8
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,530
以清晰事理与真实为名

9
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,690
成为梅乔克力斯市希望的象征

10
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,750
－超人－

11
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,300
这不是幻想

12
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,550
也不是凭空捏造

13
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,220
不，我的朋友们

14
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,980
我今天

15
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,650
带到这里的这些指控

16
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:02,690
是在这听证会上控告某些个人

17
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:07,530
他们的超感能力限制了我们的选择

18
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,830
这些是

19
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,830
无法否认的事实

20
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,340
我现在请求你们宣布你们的判决

21
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,170
对那些指控而言

22
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,140
对于这位

23
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,940
这个没有头脑只会动手的家伙

24
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,230
他唯一的表达方式是破坏与暴力

25
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,990
对这女人尔莎

26
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,820
她对全人类毫无理由的憎恨

27
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,410
甚至已经威胁克莱顿星球的儿童们

28
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,300
最后是萨得将军

29
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,760
他曾一度被这个议会所信任

30
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,810
萨得原本负责星球水晶的防护与维持

31
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:18,130
现在企图发动革命

32
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,600
想要建立一种新秩序

33
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,980
使他自己成为绝对的统治者

34
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,200
你们都听到了指控

35
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,120
现在我要听议会的决定

36
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,030
有罪

37
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,250
有罪…有罪

38
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,830
有罪

39
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,130
判决一定是你预先控制的

40
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,990
其实这就是你的决定

41
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,160
只有你一人要惩戒我们

42
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,970
而你要对我负全权之责

43
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,810
加入我们

44
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,070
你以前也以反对议会决定

45
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:15,190
你在新秩序中的地位仅次于我

46
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,240
我提供你一个绝佳的机会

47
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,620
接受吧，加入我们吧

48
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,710
你会跪在我的面前的，乔尔・埃尔

49
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,300
我发誓，不论如何

50
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,380
你会跪在我的面前的

51
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,140
不只是你

52
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,550
还有你的子孙

53
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:11,290
原谅我…原谅我

54
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,340
你们不能忽视这个事实

55
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,670
这是自杀

56
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,000
不，更糟，是祸延子孙

57
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,350
理智点，乔尔・埃尔

58
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:29,510
议会已经否定了你的陆地理论

59
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,360
朋友们，你们都知道我很理智

60
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:39,440
我不会奢求广泛的支持声明

61
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,200
而我告诉你们，我们必需立刻疏散这颗星球

62
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,370
问题不是出在你所提出的疑问

63
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,960
事实是无法否认的

64
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,260
是你的理论得不到支持

65
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,300
这颗星球在三十天之内会爆炸

66
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
如果不会更快的话

67
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:05,400
我告诉你，克莱顿星只是单纯的地壳震动

68
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:06,600
乔罗
Jor-El...

69
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,560
讲点道理
...be reasonable.

70
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,110
我的朋友
My friend...

71
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,160
我从来没有是其他的样子 这一场疯狂是你的
...I have never been otherwise. This madness is yours.

72
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,070
讨论终结
This discussion is terminated.

73
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,200
议会的决定是最后的决定
The decision of the Council is final.

74
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,020
任何由你所创造的企图
Any attempt by you to create...

75
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,850
在大众面前 想利用天候去影响到这星球
...a climate of fear and panic among the populace...

76
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,240
必需在我们的督导之下 而且依照所交代的方向去做
...must be deemed by us an act of insurrection.

77
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,480
你指责我不听令行事?
You would accuse me of insurrection?

78
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,240
现在对生命慈悲变成罪行了吗?
Has it now become a crime to cherish life?

79
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,750
你会听从议会的决定吗?
Will you abide by the Council's decision?

80
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,840
我会保持沉默
I will remain silent.

81
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,300
不论我 或是我的内人
Neither I, nor my wife...

82
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:23,460
会离开这里
...will leave Krypton.

83
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,700
你做完了吗?
Have you finished?

84
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,830
几乎好了
Nearly.

85
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,380
这是唯一的出路
It's the only answer, Lara.

86
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:30,540
若是你和我们一起留在这里
If he remains here with us...

87
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,800
你会死 就像我们会死一般
...he will die as surely as we will.

88
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,380
但为何选地球?乔罗
But why Earth, Jor-El?

89
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,390
他们的科技落后我们几千年
They're primitives, thousands of years behind us.

90
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:41,550
他需要那个优点去活下来
He will need that advantage to survive.

91
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,890
他们非常的正常
Their atmosphere will...

92
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,690
那是他停留之地
...sustain him.

93
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,740
你会弄清楚他们的强夺性
He will defy their gravity.

94
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,870
他会长的像他们的一份子
He will look like one of them.

95
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,740
他不会是他们的一份子
He won't be one of them.

96
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,250
不
No.

97
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,330
他留在水晶结构中会使他强壮
His dense molecular structure will make him strong.

98
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,590
他会非常优秀与众不同
He'll be odd. Different.

99
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,600
他会非常的快 终极上会非常的荣耀
He'll be fast. Virtually invulnerable.

100
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,180
被孤立 一个人
Isolated. Alone.

101
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:29,600
他不会是一个人
He will not be alone.

102
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,820
永远不会是一个人
He will never be alone.

103
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:27,190
他会旅行很远 我的小葛洛
You will travel far, my little Kal-El.

104
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,240
我们永远不会离开你
But we will never leave you.

105
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,570
即使在我们面对死亡之时
Even in the face of our death...

106
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,830
我们生命中丰富的一面
...the richness of our lives...

107
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,160
会是你的
...shall be yours.

108
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,720
我所拥有的 我所学到的 一切我所感觉的
All that I have, all that I've learned, everything I feel...

109
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,000
所有我所拥有的
...all this and more, I...

110
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,090
我会灌注到你自身上 儿子
...I bequeath you, my son.

111
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,720
你会在内心中负荷着我
You will carry me inside you...

112
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,020
在你的一生中
...all the days of your life.

113
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,530
你会把我的力量变成你自己的
You will make my strength your own...

114
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,820
由你的眼中看到我的一生
...see my life through your eyes...

115
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,360
而你的生命也会在我眼中出现
...as your life will be seen through mine.

116
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,070
儿子会变成父亲的父亲
The son becomes the father, and the father...

117
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,490
儿子 
...the son.

118
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,670
这是所有我所能…
This is all I...

119
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:32,760
我所能给予你的 葛洛
...all I can send you, Kal-El.

120
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,920
这是爱因斯坦所谓的相对论
... which Einstein called his theory of relativity.

121
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
全都藏在你面前的水晶中
...in the crystals before you...

122
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:55,390
这是由几千颗星球上所得到的...
... is the total accumulation of all literature and scientific fact from dozens...

123
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,680
科学事实的累积
... of other worlds...

124
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:59,100
它们全分布在第28银河系
... spanning the 28 known galaxies.

125
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:27,050
在你到达的早期 所有克莱顿星复杂的关系…
Early Chinese writings point out the complex relationship...

126
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:30,420
所有的决定都是过去几千年…
By carrying this complex equation to its ultimate power, my son...

127
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,910
在过去的这些成就
Chief among these powers will be your sight...

128
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:39,180
会成为你的视觉 力量 听觉
... your strength, your hearing...

129
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:44,080
你能为自己准备的能力 几乎是没有限度的速度
... your ability to propel yourself at almost limitless speed.

130
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:49,090
关于我们星球的早期历史 及早期对蒙赛克人的星球血战
The early history of our universe was a bloody mosaic of interplanetary war.

131
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:52,200
及你会经过的六个银行系
Each of the six galaxies which you will pass through...

132
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:55,280
都拥有他们各自的法律
... contain their own individual law of space and time.

133
00:22:55,370 --> 00:23:02,090
在太空中所不允许的 是干扰人类的历史
It is forbidden for you to interfere with human history.

134
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:38,120
- 什么? - 那是什么?
- What! - What was that?

135
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:05,150
不会全凑到一块了吗? 你能不能…
Now wouldn't that beat all get out. Well, you...

136
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:11,820
哦 天
Oh, Pa!

137
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,610
哦 上帝
Oh, my.

138
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,400
这么多快乐的年头
All these years, as happy as we've been...

139
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:55,200
我一直向上帝祈祷 给我们一个孩子
...how I've prayed the good Lord would see fit to give us a child.

140
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,900
亲爱的 请把那抹布递给我
Honey, will you hand me that rag up there.

141
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,780
你最好慢慢来 强纳森
You take things easy now.

142
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,740
记住费莱医生所说的你的心脏
Remember what Doc Frye said about that heart of yours.

143
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:12,230
我们回家后所要做的第一件事 就是要查出
Now the first thing we've got to do when we get home is find out...

144
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,340
那男孩是那一家的
...who that boy's proper family is.

145
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,090
他没有家 总之不是在这一带
He hasn't got any. Not around here, anyway.

146
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:26,020
马莎 你是否在想我以为你在想的?
Martha, Are you thinking what I think you are thinking?

147
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,250
我们可以说他是我们在北卡州 表兄的孩子
We could say he's the child of my cousin in North Dakota...

148
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,150
而现在是孤儿了
...and just now orphaned.

149
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,370
老马莎
Old Martha.

150
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,940
强纳森 他只是个孩子 
Jonathan, he's only a baby.

151
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:43,830
马莎 你看到我们是怎么找到他的了
Martha, now you saw how we found him.

152
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:48,270
马莎克拉克肯  你听到我说的话了吗?
Martha Clark Kent, are you listening to what I'm saying?

153
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:53,260
强纳森 
Jonathan 

154
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,320
来吧 伙计们 
Come on, gang.

155
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:27,120
那是场不错的比赛吧?
That was a great game.

156
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,410
好吧
All right.

157
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,310
快点 伙计们 快点 把你们的头帽放整齐点 
Come on, hustle, let's go. Stack your helmets neatly.

158
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,710
记得那身制服 明天前洗干净 
Remember about the uniforms, cleaned and washed...

159
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,340
还有看起来像是支足球队
...by tomorrow, and looking like a football team.

160
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,050
克拉克 全得为明天的比赛洗好
Let's have those clothes washed and ready for tomorrow's game.

161
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,590
看哪一个跑在最后
Got to beat Mount Vernon High.

162
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:51,320
坚持住
Hold on!

163
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,270
郎娜
Lana?

164
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,340
别麻烦这个了 我和其他装备一起拿进去
Don't bother with these. I'll take them in with the other equipment.

165
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:02,660
谢谢 克拉克 当然
- Thank you, Clark. - Sure.

166
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,920
听我说 我们一大群要去马丽欧兰斯
Listen, a whole bunch of us are going up to Mary Ellen's.

167
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:11,350
放些唱片 你愿意来吧?
Play some records. Would you like to come?

168
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,370
当然
Sure.

169
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,500
听起来会很好玩
Sounds like it could be a lot of fun.

170
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:17,720
海伦 他不能去 他有很多事要做
Kent can't make it. Still got a lot of work to do.

171
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,630
你在说些什么?我才刚叠完…
What are you talking about? I've just finished stacking...

172
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,800
那一些?
All that?

173
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,970
布莱得
Oh, Brad!

174
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,510
来吧 郎娜 
Hey, come on, Lana.

175
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,770
来吧 郎娜 
Come on, Lana.

176
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,140
来吧 我们走 
Come on, let's go.

177
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,850
- 来吧 他得清理这些 - 再见 克拉克
- He has to clean up. - 'Bye, Clark.

178
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,980
- 再见 郎娜  - 清干净这一塌 克拉克
- 'Bye, Lana. - Clean this up, Clark.

179
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:38,820
再见 克拉克
'Bye, Clark.

180
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,160
再见 克拉克
'Bye, Clark.

181
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,830
明天见 再见
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

182
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,420
看 克拉克在那 
Hey, look, there's Clark!

183
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,260
他怎么可能在这边?
Oh, how could him here?

184
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,460
克拉克 
Clark?

185
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,130
你怎么能这么快的到这的?
How did you get here so fast?

186
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,170
我跑来的
I ran.

187
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,680
跑的?
Ran, huh?

188
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:49,510
我告诉过你们他是个怪胎 我们快离开这里 
Told you he was an oddball, let's get out of here.

189
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,100
眩耀了一下 是吧?儿子
Been showing off a bit, haven't you, Son?

190
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,830
我不是故意要眩耀的 爸 
I didn't mean to show off, Pa.

191
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:17,300
只是那个叫布莱得的家伙 我想把他撕成碎片
It's just that guys like that Brad, I just want to tear them apart.

192
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,500
是 我知道 我知道
Yeah, I know.

193
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,840
是 我知道我不应该
Yeah, I know I shouldn't.

194
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,760
是 我知道你能做这些奇妙的事
Yeah, I know you can do all these amazing things...

195
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,590
有时你想 若不能告诉别人
...and sometimes you think that you will just go bust...

196
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,640
你会爆掉的
...unless you can tell people about it.

197
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,010
是没错
- Yeah. - That's right.

198
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,060
每次我打橄榄球都能触地得分的
I mean, every time I get the football I can make a touchdown.

199
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,980
这我确定 每一次 
- That's for sure. - Every time.

200
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:38,860
我是说让别人在做的事 而他也能做
Is it showing off when somebody's doing the things he's capable of doing?

201
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,940
那是眩耀吗?
Is a bird showing off when it flies?

202
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:44,370
不 你听我说
No, now, you listen to me.

203
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:45,410
当你刚到我们身边时 我们认为...
When you came to us, we thought...

204
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:48,580
别人发现你所能做的事
...people would take you away...

205
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,420
他们会把你由我们身边带走
...when they found out the things that you do.

206
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,340
而那非常令我们担忧
It worried us a lot.

207
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:56,870
而当我们逐渐老了 非常的不同
Then when a man gets older and he thinks very differently.

208
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,170
事情也变的非常清楚
And things get very clear.

209
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:04,600
有一件事我很清楚 儿子 那就是你来这是有原因的
And there's one thing I do know, Son, and that is you are here for a reason.

210
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:07,640
我不知道谁是那个原因 或不管那原因是什么 你知道吗
I don't know whose reason, or whatever the reason is...

211
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,300
也许只是因为…
...maybe it's because...

212
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:14,560
我不知道 那是…
I don't know.

213
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:23,610
但我的确知道一件事 那不是触地得分的分数
But I do know one thing. It's not to score touchdowns.

214
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,110
谢谢 爸
Thanks, Dad.

215
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,490
我们跑吧 
I'll race you to it. Yeah.

216
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,700
你会吗?来吧 
You will?

217
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,990
来吧 爸 跑吗 来吧 跑呀 
Run. Come on, come on. Move, move.

218
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,040
来呀 跑 加油 比赛呀 班 
Go, go. Come on. Hey, Baron.

219
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,640
不好 
Oh, no.

220
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:51,630
但…
But...

221
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:06,290
强纳森
Jonathan?

222
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:07,950
强纳森 
Jonathan!

223
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,290
爸?
Dad.

224
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:26,670
强纳森
Jonathan.

225
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,680
不
No.

226
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,680
不
No.

227
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,680
不
No.

228
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,800
我能做的那些事情
All those things I can do...

229
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,510
那些力量 
...all those powers...

230
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,720
而我甚至救不了他
...and I couldn't even save him.

231
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,600
我必须走了
I have to leave.

232
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:14,070
我知道这个时刻会来的
I knew this time would come.

233
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,030
我们两在找到你的那一天就晓得
We both knew it from the day we found you.

234
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,010
我昨天和班哈
I talked to Ben Hubbard yesterday.

235
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:41,020
他说 从今以后他很乐意来帮忙
He said that he'd be happy to help out from now on.

236
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,360
妈 
Mother!

237
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,070
我知道 儿子
I know, Son.

238
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:54,650
我知道
I know.

239
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:01,830
你知道…你要往那去吗?
Do you know where you're headed?

240
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,460
北方
North.

241
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,630
要记住 儿子
Remember us, Son.

242
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:18,470
永远要记住 
Always remember us.

243
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:56,560
我的儿子
My son...

244
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:06,970
你不会记得我
... you do not remember me.

245
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:08,360
我是乔罗
I am Jor-El.

246
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,450
我是你的父亲
I am your father.

247
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:16,980
到现在 你应该己18岁了
By now you will have reached your eighteenth year...

248
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:18,830
那是在地球上的算法
... as it is measured on Earth.

249
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:22,000
在那个时刻 以你们的算法
By that reckoning...

250
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:25,750
我已经死了好几千年了
... I will have been dead for many thousands of your years.

251
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,550
我所拥有的
The knowledge...

252
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,010
生理及历史上的知识
... that I have of matters, physical and historical...

253
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:37,720
在你的新家中我会彻底传授给你
... I have given you fully on your voyage to your new home.

254
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:41,780
那是很重要的事务
These are important matters to be sure...

255
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,190
但事实仍然是很重要的
... but still matters of mere fact.

256
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,730
而你所要问的问题
There are questions to be asked...

257
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:53,020
是让你自己解答的时候到了
... and it is time for you to do so.

258
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:55,660
这里是...
Here, in this...

259
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,660
维护你的一座堡垒
...this fortress of solitude...

260
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:03,830
我们应该要共同去寻找解答
... we shall try to find the answers together.

261
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:06,920
所以 我的儿子
So, my son...

262
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,210
说话吧 
... speak.

263
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,130
我是谁?
Who am I?

264
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:14,720
你叫做葛洛
Your name is Kal-El.

265
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:19,470
你是克莱顿星球唯一的生存者
You are the only survivor of the Planet Krypton.

266
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:25,060
即使晓得你是以人类扶养长大的 但你不是他们的一份子
Even though you were raised as a human, you are not one of them.

267
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:28,900
你有伟大的力量 只是还有一些你不确定的
You have great powers, only some of which you have...

268
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:34,060
那是你必需去发现的
... as yet discovered.

269
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:34,900
现在跟我来吧 吾儿
Come with me now, my son...

270
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,910
只是要突破你在地球上 所能找到的平衡
... as we break through the bars of your earthly confinement.

271
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,910
在时间的太空中飞行
Traveling through time and space.

272
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:43,910
在那第六…你的力量
Your powers will far exceed those of mortal men.

273
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:49,460
你禁止干预人类的历史
It is forbidden for you to interfere with human history.

274
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:54,090
宁愿放弃你的领导权力 而不能干预
Rather let your leadership stir others to.

275
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:59,090
在下一年中 我们要检视人类的人
In the next year, we shall examine the human heart.

276
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,810
那比它原有的样子更易碎
It is more fragile than your own.

277
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:08,100
你所超过的火焰通道 是你自己的银河系的边缘
As we pass through the flaming turmoil which is the edge of your own galaxy...

278
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:09,940
你通过了克莱顿星的红太阳边缘
... we will enter the realm of the red Krypton sun...

279
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:13,650
是你种种特殊能力的根源
... source of your strength and nourishment...

280
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:16,240
是我们祖先所留下来的方向
... and cause of our eventual destruction.

281
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,950
克莱顿星 吾儿
The Planet Krypton, my son...

282
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:25,110
你的家园 从前的家
... your home as it was.

283
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:29,170
今年 我们要检视议会 为了你的道德观
This year we shall examine the various concepts of immortality...

284
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:31,590
而那基本的是自然的事实
... and their basis in actual fact.

285
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,960
第28银河系的所有资料
The total accumulation of all knowledge spanning the 28 known galaxies...

286
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,970
全包容在我送在你身边的水晶里
... is embedded in the crystals which I have sent along with you.

287
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:42,600
好好的研读它 吾儿
Study them well, my son.

288
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:49,310
当你回到你自己的银河系之时
By the time you return to the confines of your galaxy...

289
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:51,980
你的12年会过去了
... twelve of your years will have passed.

290
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:54,360
但在其他的理由中的这一个
For this reason, among others...

291
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:57,490
我为你选择了地球
... I have chosen Earth for you.

292
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:59,990
现在是你加入你的新世界之时
It is now time for you to rejoin your new world...

293
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:04,150
而且为它服务 为它
... and to serve its collective humanity.

294
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:07,000
像他们中的一员般的过活 葛洛
Live as one of them, Kal-El...

295
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,170
去发现你的力量及威力能做什么
... and discover where your strength and your power are needed.

296
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:16,170
永远怀有一颗荣誉的心 为了特殊的职责
But always hold in your heart the pride of your special heritage.

297
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:20,220
你可以成为一个伟大的人 葛洛 我希望你是 
They can be a great people, Kal-El, they wish to be.

298
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:23,560
他们只留下来光亮给你引路
They only lack the light to show the way.

299
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:29,180
在这上述所有的理由之上 他们对于善良所拥有的蓄容力
For this reason, above all, their capacity for good...

300
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:33,180
我派了你给他们 
... I have sent them you...

301
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:38,180
我唯一的儿子 
... my only son.

302
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:14,110
好了 到了 老兄 星球日报
Okay, this is it, mac, the Daily Planet.

303
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:18,440
新鲜水果 小姐 买点蕃茄如何
Fresh fruit! Hey, how about a tomato, lady?

304
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:21,240
新鲜水果 宝贝 你好吗?
Hey, fresh fruit and vegetables.

305
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:54,560
微笑 
Smile.

306
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:58,820
喋喋不休中有几个T?
How many "T's" in "bloodletting"?

307
00:48:58,940 --> 00:48:59,820
两个
Two.

308
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:07,700
你在写什么?依连小姐
What are you writing?

309
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:10,160
一个老的规律 你怎么拼大屠杀
An ode to spring. How do you spell "massacre"?

310
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:16,720
MASSACRE RE 谢谢
M-a-s-s-a-c-r-e. r-e, Thanks.

311
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,010
好棒 依连小姐 为何你总是能有好报导?
Golly, how come you get all the great stories?

312
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:22,260
一个好记者不会有好报导 吉米
A good reporter doesn't get great stories.

313
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:23,760
一个好记者让它们变好的
A good reporter makes them great.

314
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,930
主编 这是东区谋杀案的报导
Chief, here's that story on the murder case.

315
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:29,350
依我看是社会版的头 也许那再加张照片
The way I see it, it's a headline on the front page with my picture...

316
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:33,020
强奸者只有一个P 露易丝依连 见过克拉克肯
There's only one "P" in "rapist." Lois Lane, say hello to Clark Kent.

317
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,940
依连小姐 你好
Hello, Miss Lane, how are...

318
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,490
你好 吉米欧生 摄影师
How are you doing? Jimmy Olsen, photographer.

319
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:43,450
克拉克肯 幸会 
Hi. Clark Kent. Nice to meet you.

320
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:47,760
这个什么都有了 性 暴力 客观的角度 我是说 你看
It's got everything: Sex, violence, the ethnic angle.I mean, look at...

321
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:50,240
是 女厕所的外国口音也是一样
So does a lady wrestler with a foreign accent.

322
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:52,460
- 肯 你能打开这个吗? - 当然 怀特先生
- Kent, can you open this? - Sure, Mr. White.

323
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:54,790
但这个能当系列报导的基本篇
This could be the basis for a series of articles:

324
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:57,670
露易丝依连报导的无理由杀划
"Making Sense of Senseless Killings" by Lois Lane.

325
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,600
我是说我们有心理学家 有…
We get psychologists, sociologists, interviews...

326
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:00,470
露易丝 露易丝 
Lois, Lois.

327
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:04,130
你是在推销一堆一无是处的垃圾
Lois, you're pushing a bunch of rinky-dink tabloid garbage.

328
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:06,470
星球日报有它的格调在那
The Daily Planet has a tradition...

329
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:07,080
抱歉 抱歉 
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

330
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,240
天 抱歉 我不是故意那么晃的
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shake it up like that.

331
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,850
当然不是 露易丝
Of course not, Lois.

332
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:18,240
为何会有人 会想让一个陌生人出洋相呢
Why would any one want to make a total stranger look like a fool?

333
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:19,860
那个给我
I'll take that.

334
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:20,090
谢谢 抱歉 怀特先生
Thanks. I'm sorry, Mr. White.

335
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:25,450
欧生 我付你周薪40元 是要让你来这闲晃的吗?
Why do I pay you $40 a week when I should have you arrested for loitering?

336
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:27,030
- 去给…先生拿快去  - 肯
- Go get Mr... a towel. - Kent.

337
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:28,620
- 快 - 是的 主编
- Move, kid, move. - Right, Chief.

338
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,740
是 主编
- Make mine black, no sugar. - Right, Chief.

339
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:32,290
还有别叫我亲爱的
And don't call me sugar.

340
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:35,370
是的…亲爱的
Right... Sugar.

341
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:38,250
主编要咖啡 不加糖 我要杯柠檬茶
Chief wants coffee, no sugar. I'll take tea with lemon.

342
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:42,760
露易丝 带肯去外面见见大家
Lois, why don't you take Kent out to meet everybody, huh?

343
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,800
把他向大伙们介绍一下 他今天开始为报社工作
Just introduce him around. He's starting on the paper today.

344
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:47,120
我把城市新闻部份给你了
I'm giving him the City beat.

345
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,280
主编 
Chief!

346
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:50,120
那是我的区域
That's my beat!

347
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,520
露易丝
Lois.

348
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:55,350
克拉克肯也许看来是个资浅记者
Lois, Clark Kent may seem like just a mild-mannered reporter...

349
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,130
但是听我说 他不但晓得如何适当尊敬主编
...but not only does he know how to treat his Chief with the proper respect...

350
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:01,130
他不但有一付文质彬彬的格调
...not only does he have a snappy, punchy prose style...

351
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:06,490
是我在这一行40年中 所见过最快的打字的
...but he is, in my 40 years in this business, the fastest typist I've ever seen.

352
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:07,140
抱歉
Excuse me.

353
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:12,300
这里 你忘了我的报导了
Here, you forgot my article.

354
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:16,040
打扰 怀特先生 我在想...
Excuse me, Mr. White. I was wondering...

355
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,150
你是否能以周做单位
...if you could arrange for half my salary...

356
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:21,170
把我半数的薪水寄去这个地址
...to be sent to this address on a weekly basis.

357
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:22,460
你的赌注 对吧?
Your bookie, right?

358
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:23,300
我的什么?
My what?

359
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:24,380
别告诉我
Don't tell me!

360
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:26,160
他每周寄薪水回去给他灰发的甜蜜母亲
He sends a check every week to his sweet, gray-haired mother.

361
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:31,320
事实上她是银发
Actually, she's silver-haired.

362
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:32,160
我看我能做些什么
I'll see what I can do.

363
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,160
多谢了 怀特先生
Thank you very much, Mr. White.

364
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:40,650
打扰了
Well?

365
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:44,340
家里还有人像你吗?
Any more at home like you?

366
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,030
不见得真有 没有
Not really, no.

367
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,490
我想也是
I didn't think so.

368
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:54,370
那么 到这边来给自己找张桌子
Well, get yourself a desk over here.

369
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:55,180
这里?
Over here?

370
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:59,000
是 这里有些纸 就在那边
Here, there's some paper and a file right there.

371
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:00,080
对不起
Sorry.

372
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,390
- 是 - 再见
- Yeah. - See you.

373
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,560
- 我遇到了这个很棒的男人 你知道吗? - 嘿 那太好了
- I met this really great guy, you know. - Hey, fabulous.

374
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:19,060
我们度过了美好的周末 我和他在农场里见面
We had this fabulous weekend. I met him at this dude ranch.

375
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:20,770
好像已经认识我很久了
I haven't been since I was seven.

376
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:23,690
我得去寄这些了 好的 拜拜 祝你今晚好运
- I got to mail these letters. - Good luck tonight.

377
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:25,160
克拉克 露易丝 
- Hi, Clark. - Hi, Lois.

378
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,240
喜欢你上班的第一天吗?
How did you like your first day on the job?

379
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:31,070
这 坦白说时间比我期待的要长
The hours were sort of longer than I expected...

380
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:34,410
但还好 你知道我的意思是 遇见了你 吉米欧生 怀特先生
...but on the whole, meeting you and Jimmy Olsen and Mr. White...

381
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:36,660
在那种情况下 我说我自我陶醉
Gosh, on a whole, I'd say it's been swell.

382
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:38,120
自我陶醉?
- "Swell"? - Yup.

383
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,210
你知道吗?克拉克
You know, Clark...

384
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:45,000
在这世上只剩下很少数的人
...there are very few people left in the world...

385
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:47,130
在觉得舒服时会说那个字
...who feel comfortable saying that word.

386
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:48,460
那一个字? 自我陶醉
- What word? - Swell.

387
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:51,090
对我则听起来很自然
Really? I always thought it was kind of natural.

388
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,430
对不起  克拉克 
- Sorry. - Clark.

389
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:58,440
你先 没关系的

390
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:00,310
- 对不起 露易丝 - 嘿 雷
- Sorry, Lois. - Hi, Rex.

391
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:02,270
- 今天看到什么好的吗? - 在你出现之前没有
- Did you see anything good today? - Not until you came along.

392
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:03,440
露易丝
Lois.

393
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:04,940
雷 这位是…
Rex, this is...

394
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,820
- 克拉克肯 - 你好 幸会 
- Clark Kent. How do... - See you...

395
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,150
露易丝
Lois?

396
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:12,490
你要去那?
Hey, where you going?

397
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:13,950
我能帮你穿大衣吗?
Can I help you with your coat?

398
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:15,830
- 谢谢 那就行了 - 当然
- Thanks, can you get that? - Sure.

399
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:17,290
你喜欢怀特先生吗?
Did you like Mr. White?

400
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:18,290
他是个好人 吉米欧生也棒极了
He was a nice guy and Jimmy was fantastic.

401
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:19,460
嘿
Hey!

402
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:20,460
过来这
Come here.

403
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,250
快点...
Come on...

404
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:23,920
过来 快点过来
Get in here, hurry up. Come on.

405
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,340
克拉克 我想我们最好离开这里
We'd better get out of here.

406
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:26,300
我想我们最好照他说的做 露易丝
We'd better do what he says, Lois.

407
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:29,010
过来 过来 进来这里面 快点
Come on, get in here, quick.

408
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:32,010
别…别做任何事 好吗? 就是这样我来了 别这样
Don't, don't do anything. It's all right, I'm coming.

409
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:33,340
我来了
We're coming.

410
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:34,550
抱歉
Excuse me.

411
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:36,010
- 这里? - 对 对
- Here? - Yeah, yeah.

412
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:39,180
请别用那个指着我 先生 你用那可能会伤到人的
Don't point that at me, sir. You could hurt somebody with that.

413
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:42,020
好了 好了 在那别动
Okay, okay. Hold it there.

414
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:43,270
稍候一下
Just a minute.

415
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,770
当然我了解这些日子难过
Now I realize that...

416
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:48,150
但这并不是解决之道
...times are tough for some these days, but this isn't the answer.

417
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:51,320
你不能用枪来解决社会上的问题
You can't solve society's problems with a gun.

418
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,330
你知道吗?老弟 你是对的
You know, somebody, you're right.

419
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:58,200
我要转变去过新生活 对你有益 先生 那很好
- I'm going to turn over a new leaf. - Good for you. That's the spirit.

420
00:53:58,330 --> 00:54:00,370
你看 他并不想伤害任何人
He doesn't really want to hurt anyone.

421
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,330
我抢过这位小姐的皮包之后
Right after I rip off this lady's purse.

422
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:04,370
当然

有病?这个死亡的记号?
I'm sick, Ms. Teschmacher?

485
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:13,790
创造世纪最大的犯罪是有病?

不…不 请离开那里
No. Step away from that, please.

487

你如何对我们这时代最伟大罪犯 选择祝贺的用词?
How do you choose to congratulate the greatest criminal mind of our time?

495
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:47,740
为何那么多人得为世纪之罪而死
Why do so many people have to die for the crime of the century?

496
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:49,110
为何?你问为什么?
Why? You ask why?

497
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:52,740
当你在浴盆里时电话响你怎么办
Why does the phone always ring when you're in the bathtub?

498
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:57,370
为何这时代最聪明的魔鬼领导者
Why is the most brilliantly diabolical leader of our time...

499
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:00,370
让他自己为白痴所围绕者?
...surrounding himself with total nincompoops?

500
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:01,750
我回来了 路梭先生
I'm back, Mr. Luthor.

501

是的 我正在谈到你
I was just talking about you.

502
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:06,920
你又被跟踪了
You were followed again.

503
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:13,300
又是那些像猫一般的悲伤之事
In spite of those cat-like reflexes.

504
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:20,100
- 路梭先生 路梭先生 我很抱歉 - 欧帝斯
- Mr. Luthor. Mr. Luthor.I'm sorry. - Otis.

505

那是我要你为我买的报纸吗?
Is that the newspaper I asked you to get me?

506
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:26,650
是的
Yes.

507
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:29,240
那么我为何没在看它呢?
Then why am I not reading it?

508
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:33,160
因为我还没交给你?
Because I haven't given it to you yet?

509
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:34,240
没错 
Right.

510
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:40,790
终于 是官方的了
At last it's official.

511
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:43,960
谢谢慷慨的美国政府的协助
Thanks to the help of the US Government...

512
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:47,970
我们要成为历史上最伟大的 房地产的前锋
...we are about to be involved in the greatest real-estate swindle of all time.

513
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:49,510
赖克斯 为何
Lex, what is this...

514
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:52,970
对土地那么的狂热 永远是土地 土地 土地 
...obsession with real estate? All the time, "land, land, land."

515
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:54,810
黛丝马克小姐 当我六岁时 家父对我说
Miss Teschmacher, When I was 6 years old, my father said to me...

516
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:58,480
滚出去
"Get out! "

517
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:02,150
在那个之前 他说：儿子  星星也许会升起 下沉
Before that, he said, "Son, stocks may rise and fall...

518
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:05,190
直到这些交通系统也许会崩溃
''...utilities and transportation systems may collapse...

519
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:08,240
人们没有一点的好处 但他们永远需要土地
''...people are no damn good, but they'll always need land...

520
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,780
经由他们的鼻子去取得它 
''...they'll pay through the nose to get it."

521
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:13,070
记住家父所说的 土地 
- "Remember," my father said... - "Land."

522
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:15,990
没错
Right.

523
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:18,740
他没看到我如何谦卑的开始
It's a pity that he didn't see...

524
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:21,750
建造这整个帝国 是种遗憾
...from such humble beginnings how I've created this empire.

525
01:02:21,830 --> 01:02:23,120
帝国?这个?
An empire. This?

526
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:27,840
黛丝马克小姐 你认识多少女孩有像这个这样的
Miss Teschmacher,How many girls do you know have a Park Avenue address like this?

527
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:33,010
公园大道地址?在地下两百英尺?
Park Avenue address, 200 feet below?

528
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:35,930
你知道上面有多少人在争吵
Do you realize what people are shelling out up there...

529
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:38,720
只为了几间房及普通的电梯?
...for a few miserable rooms off a common elevator.

530
01:02:39,310 --> 01:02:41,220
一个人还能要求些什么?
What more could anyone ask?

531
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:49,160
- 欧生 
- 什么事?

534
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:58,070
你还站在那里干什么?
Why are you standing here for?

535
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:58,950
我没有
I'm not.

536
01:02:59,830 --> 01:03:01,540
我又没有要说去

巴西那个字里面没有Z
There's no "Z" in "brassiere."

544
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:29,060
露易丝 你有一分钟吗?
Lois, have you got a minute?

545
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:30,770
对不起露易丝 
Excuse me, please.

546
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:34,910

Good night.

548
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,450
我想你也许想和我共进晚餐

549
01:03:38,530 --> 01:03:40,450
抱歉 克拉克 我还有事
I'm sorry, I'm booked.

550
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:45,080
空军一号要降落在机场 这些孩子要很确定你晓得
Air Force One is landing at the airport. This kid'll be there to make sure...

551
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:48,120

老天 你难道从未休息
Don't you ever let up?

553

What for? I mean I've seen how the other half lives.

My sister, for instance. Three kids, two cats, and one mortgage.

555
01:03:57,220 --> 01:03:59,050
我一星期内就会变成神经病
I would go bananas in a week.

Otis.

692
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:12,570
我的浴袍 
My robe.

693
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:16,330
马上来 路梭先生
Right away, Mr. Luthor.

694
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:21,070
你知道 总之我在想 他是来这搅局的
It all fits somehow, this coming here to Metropolis...

695
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:23,500
在这个特别的时间
...and at this particular time.

696
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:29,800
那是种残酷的真理
There's a kind of cruel justice about it.

697
01:18:30,170 --> 01:18:37,070
我是说要完成世纪之罪的人 自然也想面对世纪之挑战
To commit the crime of the century, a man wants to face the challenge of the century.

698
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:40,920
听我说 路梭先生 也许这个会飞的人只是经过而己 你知道吗?
Listen, maybe this guy that flies is just sort of passing through. You know?

699
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:44,090
经过?
Passing through?

700
01:18:44,230 --> 01:18:44,930
不是在你的生命中 欧帝斯
Not on your life, Otis...

701
01:18:45,130 --> 01:18:48,570
另外我很遗憾的要做牺牲
...which I would gladly sacrifice by the way...

702
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:52,610
那个摧毁他所代表的一切的机会
...for the opportunity of destroying everything that he represents.

703
01:18:53,130 --> 01:19:00,110
另外 欧帝斯 下一次等我出池子后 再为我穿上浴袍
And, Otis, by the way, next time put my robe on after I'm out of the pool.

704
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:02,210
现在 看着 
Now look.

The Planet. We're sitting on top of the story of the century here.

01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:13,960
我要那会飞的人的姓名
I want the name of this flying whatchamacallit...

710
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:17,140
出现在星球日报上就像是熏肉蛋
...to go with the Daily Planet like bacon and eggs...

711
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:20,310
香肠与豆子 死亡与收税 政治与崩溃
...franks and beans, death and taxes, politics and corruption.

712
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:21,770
我不认为他会降落下来
I don't think that he'd...

713
01:19:21,850 --> 01:19:24,650
让我们达成 怀特先生
...lend himself to any cheap promotion schemes.

714
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:26,560
你是怎么晓得的?肯
Exactly how would you know that?

715
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,980
只是第一印象
Just first impression.

716
01:19:31,070 --> 01:19:33,620
谁在说低价了? 必要的话我请他当合伙人
Who's talking cheap? I'll make him a partner if I have to.

717
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:35,110
- 对吧? - 对 主编
- Right? - Right, Chief.

718
01:19:37,370 --> 01:19:38,700
我要真实的报导
I want the real story.

719
01:19:38,830 --> 01:19:40,790
我要这个人的内幕资料

720
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:45,150
他是否有家人?他住在哪? 那S代表了什么?
Has he got a family? Where does he live? What does the "S" stand for?

721
01:19:45,190 --> 01:19:47,150

What's he got hidden under that cape? Batteries?

725

一定有原因 他为何昨晚露面?
Why did he show up last night?

726
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,000
尼克?他是打那来的?

770

你其他的身体功能都是正常的
...the rest of your bodily functions are normal?

773
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:09,870
抱歉 请再说一次
I beg your pardon?

774
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,870
那么我用字来说
Well, putting it delicately...

775
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:18,550
你…
...do you...

776

那么…那么…
Well, then is it true...

780
01:23:31,410 --> 01:23:37,730
你是否真的能看透一切东西?
...that you can see through anything?

781
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:39,730
是的 我可以 蛮清楚的
Yes, I can, pretty much.

782
01:23:40,690 --> 01:23:43,220
而且你完全不会感到痛
And that you're totally impervious to pain?

783
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:46,390
到目前为止
Well, so far.

784
01:23:46,430 --> 01:23:51,390

- 没有 - 我真是的
- No. - I did.

787
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:00,410
不 一点也不  只是这花盆一定是铅做的
No, it's just that this planter must be made of lead.

788
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:01,920
是 它是 所以呢?
Yes, it is. So?

789
01:24:02,010 --> 01:24:05,250
你知道吗?我看透那个有点问题
I sort of have a problem seeing through lead.

790
01:24:05,450 --> 01:24:07,250
那倒很有趣
That's interesting.

791
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:10,420
看透铅有问题
Problems with lead.

你的背景是什么?在哪成长的?
What's your background? Where are you from?

798
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:33,270
事实上那蛮难解释的
It's kind of hard to explain, actually.

799
01:24:33,470 --> 01:24:37,580
你知道吗?我来自… 蛮远的地方
You see, I'm from... Well, from pretty far away.

Say?

817
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:51,200

- I need a sweater. It must be kind of... - No, you'll be warm enough.

826
01:26:20,890 --> 01:26:21,730
你预备好了吗?
Ready?

827
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:26,690
克拉克说你只是某些人的幻想
Clark said that you were just a figment of somebody's imagination.

828
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:28,390
像是小飞侠
Like Peter Pan.

829
01:26:28,590 --> 01:26:31,390
克拉克?他是谁?你的男友?
Clark, who's that? Your boyfriend?

830
01:26:31,590 --> 01:26:35,870
克拉克?他不是什么 他只是… - 小飞侠?
- Clark? No, he's nothing. - Peter Pan?

831
01:26:38,370 --> 01:26:45,560
小飞侠只适合小孩子 露易丝 那是神话
Peter Pan flew with children, Lois. In a fairy tale.

832
01:29:58,700 --> 01:30:00,110
你能看穿我的心灵吗?
Can you read my mind?

833
01:30:04,810 --> 01:30:05,770
你知不知道这是什么?

834
01:30:05,790 --> 01:30:08,000
能怎么对我吗?
Do you know what it is that you do to me?

835
01:30:11,380 --> 01:30:12,880
我不知道你是谁
I don't know who you are.

836
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:22,780
只是位由其他星星来的朋友
Just a friend from another star.

837
01:30:25,430 --> 01:30:27,640
我在这像个在上学的小孩
Here I am, like a kid out of school.

838
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:31,230
和上帝牵着手
Holding hands with a god.

839
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:34,270
我是个傻子
I'm a fool.

840
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:37,650
你看看我
Will you look at me?

841
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:39,190
在发抖
Quivering.

842
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:42,160
像个小女孩 在发抖
Like a little girl shivering.

843
01:30:43,570 --> 01:30:45,450
你可以看透我 
You can see right through me.

844
01:30:49,850 --> 01:30:54,810
你能看穿我的心灵吗?
Can you read my mind?

845
01:30:56,130 --> 01:30:58,420
你能把我在想的事凑成幅景象吗
Can you picture the things I'm thinking of?

846
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:05,100
奇怪你为何是这样的
Wondering why you are...

847
01:31:06,970 --> 01:31:09,600
你是所有的好事情的共同聚合
... all the wonderful things you are.

848
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:13,730
你会飞 
You can fly.

849
01:31:15,310 --> 01:31:16,860
你属于天空 
You belong in the sky.

850
01:31:19,150 --> 01:31:20,110
你和我…
You and I...

851
01:31:22,110 --> 01:31:23,780
可以属于彼此 
... could belong to each other.

852
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:28,700
若是你需要一位朋友
If you need a friend...

853
01:31:32,330 --> 01:31:34,250
我是能陪你飞的 
... l'm the one to fly to.

854
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:41,860
若是你需要被爱 
If you need to be loved...

855
01:31:42,630 --> 01:31:43,630
我就在这里 
... here I am.

856
01:31:45,470 --> 01:31:46,720
看穿我的心灵吧 
Read my mind.

857
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:10,700
我想我们忘了时间了
We forgot to time ourselves.

858
01:32:11,930 --> 01:32:16,890
那么 也许下次吧 
Maybe next time.

859
01:32:24,090 --> 01:32:24,970
你没事吧?
You okay?

860
01:32:27,950 --> 01:32:30,920
那么 晚安了
Good night.

861
01:32:31,350 --> 01:32:32,270
晚安 
Good night.

862
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:39,150
好一个超人
What a super man!

863
01:32:45,740 --> 01:32:47,030
超人 
Superman!

864
01:32:47,970 --> 01:32:49,940
露易丝
Lois.

865
01:32:49,970 --> 01:32:51,940
露易丝
Lois.

866
01:32:52,450 --> 01:32:53,500
有人在家吗?
Anybody home? Hello?

867
01:32:54,980 --> 01:32:59,940
露易丝
Lois.

868
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:04,380
- 我能进来吗? - 可以
- Hi. Can I come in? - Oh, yeah.

869
01:33:04,990 --> 01:33:09,350
露易丝 我的老天  你没听到我在敲门?
For goodness' sake, didn't you hear me knocking?

870
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:14,960
露易丝 我们今晚有约会 记得吗?
We did have a date tonight, remember?

871
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,800
露易丝 你没有在…
You haven't been...?

872
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:23,970
没有 没有 的确希望你没有 那么 我们走吧 好吗?
I should certainly hope not. Well, let's push off, shall we?

873
01:33:24,650 --> 01:33:27,240
我最好去拿外套 也许会感冒 稍候好的
I'd better get a coat. It might be cold out.

874
01:33:27,450 --> 01:33:29,810
不 我是说我需要皮包 整理我的头发
I mean, I need a purse, and I have to fix my hair...

875
01:33:30,010 --> 01:33:34,970
擦点腮红
...put some blush on.

876
01:33:50,030 --> 01:33:52,000
露易丝
Lois.

877
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:57,990
有件事我必须告诉你 我真的是…
There's something I have to tell you. I'm really...

878
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:02,270
我是说我开始时对今晚很紧张
I was at first really nervous about tonight.

879
01:34:03,730 --> 01:34:06,850
然后我决定 管他的 我要让你有一生中难得的经验
But then I decided, darn it, I was going to show you the time of your life.

880
01:34:07,050 --> 01:34:12,010
那是克拉克很好
That's Clark nice.

881
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:15,020
我在想也许我们能去吃汉堡 或是任何你想做的
We could go for a hamburger or whatever you want to do.

882
01:34:15,060 --> 01:34:19,010
（我和超人共度了一夜）

883
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:21,030
（露易丝依连独家专访）

884
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:24,030
现在…
Now then...

885
01:34:24,630 --> 01:34:27,760
规定他提到的星系准确的位置 
...given the exact location of the galaxy that he mentions...

886
01:34:28,340 --> 01:34:31,390
可能有他们自己的太阳系
...and the proximity to our own solar system...

887
01:34:34,140 --> 01:34:37,730
那真的太奇妙了 太奇妙了
It's amazing. Amazing!

888
01:34:37,930 --> 01:34:39,060
好的不像是真的
Too good to be true.

889
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:42,400
好的不像是真的 他6尺4寸高 黑发碧眼
It's too good to be true. 6' 4", black hair, blue eyes...

890
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:43,880
不抽烟不喝酒而且说实话
...doesn't drink or smoke and tells the truth.

891
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:45,030
黛丝马克小姐
Miss Teschmacher.

892
01:34:45,230 --> 01:34:48,050
有人能看战争与和平
Some people can read War and Peace...

893
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:49,890
而把它看成单纯的冒险故事
...and think it was an adventure story.

894
01:34:50,090 --> 01:34:52,890
有人能看口香糖的包装纸
Others can read the ingredients on a gum wrapper...

895
01:34:53,090 --> 01:34:57,050
而破解宇宙的连锁
...and unlock the secrets of the universe.

896
01:34:57,700 --> 01:35:04,060
赖克斯 口香糖和宇宙的连锁 又有什么关系?
Lex, what has chewing gum got to do with the secrets of the universe?

897
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:05,960
对的 对的 黛丝马克小姐
Right, Miss Teschmacher.

898
01:35:09,590 --> 01:35:11,090
以及…以及
"N."

899
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:15,080
M 你要M部份?路梭先生 马上就到 
"M"? You want "M," Mr. Luthor? Coming right up.

900
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:17,600
好了 到了 M部份
So there you go, "M."

901
01:35:17,810 --> 01:35:18,920
M是代表神经病
"M" as in "moron," Otis? No.

902
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:22,060
不 不 不 是N N是尼安德塔人
It's "N" as in "Neanderthal''...

903
01:35:22,390 --> 01:35:25,110
笨人 低贱的人 而L是梯子 
..."nincompoop," "nitwit," and "L" as in "ladder."

904
01:35:25,190 --> 01:35:26,980
是 梯子 路梭先生 马上来
Here's a ladder, coming right up.

905
01:35:27,070 --> 01:35:29,030
我只是没看...
I didn't see...

906
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:31,240
我很抱歉 路梭先生
I'm sorry, Mr. Luthor.

907
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:36,160
在专访中说克莱顿星…
In the interview he says that the Planet Krypton...

908
01:35:37,140 --> 01:35:40,110
1948年爆炸了
...exploded in 1948.

909
01:35:40,660 --> 01:35:42,460
那荒谬的怪谈
That ridiculous little freak...

910
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:45,380
花了三年陨石才到达地球
...took three years in a rocket to get to earth.

911
01:35:46,130 --> 01:35:47,750
- 这里开始了 - 这里开始了
- Ergo... - Ergo.

912
01:35:48,050 --> 01:35:51,120
1948年 花了三年…
Ergo 1948, that's three years on.

913
01:35:51,550 --> 01:35:51,950
他身高6尺4寸 你知道吗?
He's 6' 4", you know that?

914
01:35:52,150 --> 01:35:58,120
你知道为何两百这数字 和你我都有关系吗?
Do you know why the number 200 is so vitally descriptive to both you and me?

915
01:35:58,560 --> 01:35:58,960
是你的体重与我的智商
It's your weight and my I.Q.

916
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:02,130
现在 人们 想想看 想想看 
Think, people, think.

917
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:07,120
综合那些理由 那是那游戏之名
Deductive reasoning. That's the name of the game.

918
01:36:07,170 --> 01:36:10,140
克莱顿星的物质在爆炸时
Fragments from the Planet Krypton...

919
01:36:10,570 --> 01:36:12,650
进入了外太空
...exploded and went into outer space.

920
01:36:12,820 --> 01:36:14,610
假设其中的部分...
It is reasonable to assume...

921
01:36:14,740 --> 01:36:17,740
坠落在地球是有道理的...that some of those particles of debris
drifted to Earth.

922
01:36:20,660 --> 01:36:21,580
陨石 
Meteorites!

923
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:40,160
在阿利斯阿拉巴发现一块陨石 
A meteorite found in Addis Ababa?

924
01:36:40,930 --> 01:36:43,390
我知道我要因此到山上走一遭 但是…
I know I'll get rapped in the mouth for this, but...

925
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:44,640
又怎么样?
...so what?

926
01:36:45,270 --> 01:36:47,940
你是说对我们它只是块陨石
So what? You mean to us they're just meteorites.

927
01:36:48,860 --> 01:36:49,820
很公平
Fair enough.

928
01:36:50,770 --> 01:36:53,280
但它的辐射线的水准是那么高
But the level of specific radioactivity...

929
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:56,030
这东西对来自克莱顿的人而言
...is so high to anyone from the Planet Krypton...

930
01:36:56,450 --> 01:36:58,030
是致命物质
...this substance is lethal.

931
01:36:58,700 --> 01:37:00,160
等一下 路梭先生
Wait a minute, Mr. Luthor.

932
01:37:00,580 --> 01:37:02,020
你是说火与子弹不能伤到这家伙
Fire and bullets can't hurt this guy...

933
01:37:02,220 --> 01:37:04,790
而这里的这个东西…
...but this stuff here...

934
01:37:04,870 --> 01:37:07,040
会杀了他 
...will kill him.

935
01:37:10,540 --> 01:37:12,500
和我待在同一间房里
Doesn't it give you a kind of...

936
01:37:12,590 --> 01:37:16,300
对你们不是种震惊或电击吗?
...a shudder of electricity through you to be in the same room with me?

937
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:20,850
不会比你试着把那块石头 装到他身上时更震惊
Not like the shudder you'll get when you lay that rock on him.

938
01:37:20,970 --> 01:37:24,220
你以他的千里眼能看到 你从几哩路以外来了
He can see you coming for miles with those super peepers of his.

939
01:37:24,430 --> 01:37:28,210
我的天  你给了他们双眼但却看不见
O Lord, you gave them eyes, but they cannot see...

940
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:30,650
即使是超人也不能看透铅
...nor can Superman, through lead.

941
01:37:32,690 --> 01:37:34,050
他不能看透铅
He can't see through lead?

942
01:37:34,250 --> 01:37:39,210
而克莱顿的陨石会毁灭他 
And Kryptonite will destroy him.

943
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:43,230
有任何问题吗?学生们
Any questions, class?

944
01:37:43,830 --> 01:37:46,120
不知道在阿利斯阿拉巴穿着什么
I wonder what they're wearing in Addis Ababa?

945
01:37:46,790 --> 01:37:48,250
看起来像是僧袍 你知道…
Looks like a burnoose.

946
01:37:48,370 --> 01:37:50,540
我们走 要24…
It's just a wraparound.

947
01:37:50,670 --> 01:37:53,070
我们要去阿利斯阿拉巴? 路梭先生
Are we going to Addis Ababa, Mr. Luthor?

948
01:37:53,270 --> 01:37:56,510
母鸟对飞弹运输队 请回答
Mother Bird to Missile Convoy, over.

949
01:37:56,970 --> 01:37:59,220
这是运输队对母鸟 请讲
Missile Convoy to Mother Bird, go ahead.

950
01:37:59,470 --> 01:38:03,390
一切看起来都很好 基地见了 通话完毕
Everything looks good, see you at the base. Over and out.

951
01:38:03,890 --> 01:38:06,270
知道了 母鸟 通话完毕
Roger, Mother Bird. Over and out.

952
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:50,640
看看这个 
Look at this!

953
01:38:51,350 --> 01:38:52,560
蛮严重的
Looks pretty bad.

954
01:38:56,340 --> 01:39:01,300
最好量一下她的脉博
Take her pulse.

955
01:39:08,950 --> 01:39:10,660
好了 用无线电叫辆救护车来
Get an ambulance down here.

956
01:39:10,750 --> 01:39:14,040
我不想把全部的人都挡在这里
I don't want to hold this convoy up more than I have to.

957
01:39:14,130 --> 01:39:16,470
她呼吸有困难 长官 你认为呢
She's having trouble breathing. What do you think?

958
01:39:16,670 --> 01:39:19,670
我建议给她做点胸部按摩
I suggest a vigorous chest massage.

959
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:22,260
再做…口对口人工呼吸
If that doesn't work, mouth-to-mouth.

960
01:39:22,340 --> 01:39:23,340
是的 长官
Yes, sir!

961
01:39:24,970 --> 01:39:28,330
中士 我不会让我的人 做任何我不会亲自做的事
I won't have my men do anything I wouldn't be prepared to do myself.

962

我办到了 路梭先生
I did it, Mr. Luthor.

968

真是太爽了 我办到了
Miss Teschmacher, I did it.

969
01:40:26,990 --> 01:40:28,230
如同你所告诉我的 好了 欧帝斯 好了
- Just like you told me. - All right, Otis.

970
01:40:28,430 --> 01:40:32,080
欧帝斯听我说 不是我不信任你 但是…
It isn't that I don't trust you, but...

971
01:40:32,430 --> 01:40:35,240
我不信任你 欧帝斯你做了什么
I don't trust you, Otis. What did you do?

972
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:40,400
我将第一组导向器
I set the first directional vector...

973
01:40:40,750 --> 01:40:42,260
设定在38上

第二组67 而第三组在117上
The second one to 67. And the third one to 117.

975
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:48,220
那第四组呢?
What about the fourth one?

976
01:40:48,550 --> 01:40:49,810
什么第四组?
What fourth one?

977
01:40:50,010 --> 01:40:52,250
且慢 且慢 第三组是117?
Wait a minute. The third one to 117?

978
01:40:52,450 --> 01:40:57,420
- 是的 我把它写下来了 路梭先生 - 欧帝斯
- Yes. See, I wrote it down, Mr. Luthor. - Otis!

979
01:40:57,460 --> 01:41:02,420
第三组应该是11 第四组是7
The third one was supposed to be 11, and the fourth one, 7.

980
01:41:03,490 --> 01:41:05,650
哦 路梭先生
Oh, gee, Mr. Luthor.

981
01:41:05,990 --> 01:41:07,270
我想是我的手臂不够长 你看
I guess my arm wasn't long enough, see.

982
01:41:07,470 --> 01:41:10,870
欧帝斯 你想要有长手臂吗?
Would you like to see a long arm?

983
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:14,660
欧帝斯 你想要有很长的手臂吗
Otis, would you like to see a very, very, long arm?

984
01:41:14,750 --> 01:41:15,960
不 不 路梭先生
No, Mr. Luthor.

985
01:41:29,490 --> 01:41:35,450
- 好了 弄对它 行吗? - 是的 路梭先生
- All right. Get it right. - Yes, Mr. Luthor.

986
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:39,020
麦克唐诺 我以为你告诉我
I thought you told me this road would be blocked off?

987
01:41:39,100 --> 01:41:43,460
- 考布劳斯基 这 - 我不是问他 是问你
- Jablowsky, didn't I tell you... - I didn't ask him, I asked you.

988
01:41:43,690 --> 01:41:45,400
好了 跟我来 跟我来
All right. Follow me, men.

989
01:41:47,110 --> 01:41:50,370
把那东西倒出路面去  把那东西倒离此地 
Back that thing off the road. Back it off the road.

990
01:42:00,250 --> 01:42:03,170
好了 听着 你必须调头回去 我没时间和你争执
You'll have to circle back. I don't have time to argue.

991
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:04,920
你开回你来的地方 行吗?
It's a heck of a day, isn't it?

992
01:42:10,530 --> 01:42:11,500
那是12号道路
Route 12.

993
01:42:11,530 --> 01:42:15,500
12号道路 那是在那后面 不是吗?不 长官 在那上面
- Route 12? That's back there. - No, sir, it's up there.

994
01:42:15,540 --> 01:42:17,500
你确定吗?你们是打那来的?

995
01:42:17,540 --> 01:42:24,500
中士 我们转错弯了 我是上尉 你在和海军军官说话
- Sergeant, we took the wrong road. - I'm a Lieutenant. A Naval Officer.

996
01:42:28,550 --> 01:42:33,510
闭嘴 现在12号道路在哪条路后面了
Shut up! Now Route 12 is back that way.

As you know, the Daily Planet is very interested in that dam...

999
01:42:55,580 --> 01:42:58,140
但是我所不了解的是
...but what I don't understand...

1000
01:42:58,230 --> 01:43:01,230
你为何会卖给一个素未谋面之人
...is why you'd sell out to a faceless person you've never met?

1001
01:43:01,310 --> 01:43:02,690
我是说你甚至不知他的姓名
You don't know his name.

1002
01:43:05,590 --> 01:43:07,390
在他对这一无用处的沙漠
At the stupid high price he offered...

1003
01:43:07,590 --> 01:43:10,390
所开出来那么离谱的高价之后
...for this worthless piece of desert...

1004
01:43:10,590 --> 01:43:14,550
我希望它是坏地方
...I hope it's Custer!

1005
01:43:14,590 --> 01:43:17,400
好极了 那正是我所需的 谢谢
Perfect, just what I need. Thank you.

1006
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:22,570
由火箭的那个方向打 地面是

两枚SK101火箭

1009
01:43:28,610 --> 01:43:34,310
一枚由陆军发射 另一枚由海军发射
One by the Army, and one by the Navy.

01:43:34,510 --> 01:43:36,890
大家好 今天有人看到露易丝在附近吗?
Hi, everybody. Has anybody seen Lois today?

1011
01:43:36,970 --> 01:43:39,180
没 我没看见他 但主编要见你
No, but the Chief wants to see you.

1012
01:43:39,270 --> 01:43:41,100
你挡住电视 克拉克
You're blocking the set, Clark.

1013

Good. Great.

1015

打扰 怀特先生
Excuse me, Mr. White.

1016
01:43:47,730 --> 01:43:50,430
- 你找我? - 先生 你今天看到露易丝了吗?
You wanted to see me, sir? Have you seen Lois today?

1017
01:43:50,630 --> 01:43:53,950
她到西部去查件土地买卖的事
She's out West, looking into a land-fraud deal.

1018
01:43:54,280 --> 01:43:56,910
欧生和她在一块 出第一次任务
I sent young Olsen with her on his first assignment.

1019
01:43:56,990 --> 01:44:00,170
有一个未经证实身份的小丑 在那里用惊人的价钱
Some unidentified clown is buying thousands of acres...

1020
01:44:00,370 --> 01:44:02,580
在购买几千亩无用的沙漠
...of worthless desert at incredible prices.

1021
01:44:02,710 --> 01:44:03,440
那似乎没什么道理
That doesn't seem to make sense.

1022
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:06,450
这世界没什么道理 肯 到现在你应该已经晓得了
The world doesn't make sense. You ought to know that.

1023
01:44:06,650 --> 01:44:09,800
看看这个由阿利斯阿拉巴拍来的
Look at this dispatch from Addis Ababa.

一块毫无价值的陨石 那你怎么想?
A worthless piece of meteorite. How do you figure that?

1026
01:44:16,660 --> 01:44:17,620
这个 坦白说
Well, frankly...

1027
01:44:17,890 --> 01:44:20,600
我无法了解任何形态的暴力
I've never been able to understand violence.

1028
01:44:21,230 --> 01:44:22,560
怀特先生我了解你那一点 肯
I know that about you.

1029
01:44:22,730 --> 01:44:24,650
那是我要和你谈谈的另一个原因
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

1030
01:44:24,660 --> 01:44:27,470
我在这新闻的游戏中待了40年 孩子
I've been in this news game 40 years man and boy...

1031
01:44:27,670 --> 01:44:32,400
我到达我现在的地位 凭藉的是胆量 怜惜 冲劲活力
...and I got where I am with guts, compassion...

1032
01:44:32,820 --> 01:44:35,860
及某些在你缺乏的东西 孩子
...elbow grease and something you're sadly lacking in, son.

谦虚?
Humility?

1034
01:44:37,950 --> 01:44:40,540
不 不是谦虚 你有一大袋谦虚
Not humility, you've got bags of humility.

1035
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:42,480
进取及信心 那才是成功之钥 
Aggression, confidence, that's the ticket.

1036
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:47,640
发号施令 让人们知道你是谁
Take charge. Let people know who you are.

1037
01:44:54,300 --> 01:44:55,880
我是赖克斯

那就是你
That's you.

1040
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:06,660
大约再过五分钟 一座含有氢化物的毒气制造工厂
In five minutes, a poisoned gas pellet containing propane lithium compound...

1041
01:45:06,850 --> 01:45:09,940
会释放出两千单位到城市中去
... will be released through thousands of air ducts in this city...

1042
01:45:10,020 --> 01:45:12,510
非常的有 半个查布罗市的人口会
... effectively annihilating half the population of Metropolis.

1043
01:45:12,710 --> 01:45:16,660
我在我多数的朋友还是影印小弟 我就已经是记者了
I was a reporter before most of my friends were copy boys.

1044
01:45:17,070 --> 01:45:19,780
我想让露易丝介绍超人让你认识
I want you to get Lois to introduce you to Superman.

1045
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:23,250

Find out who he is. Where did he get that blue suit?

1046
01:45:23,370 --> 01:45:25,530
是用什么做的?丝吗?塑胶?
Did he have it made? Is it silk? Is it plastic?

1047
01:45:25,730 --> 01:45:27,530
我知道对你的健康没什么影响
I know it all seems a bit much...

1048
01:45:27,730 --> 01:45:29,530
但是我要见你 超人
... but how else was I going to meet you, Superman?

1049
01:45:29,730 --> 01:45:34,690
我知道你从不能拒绝喝茶的邀请
I knew you'd never accept an invitation to tea.

1050
01:45:34,730 --> 01:45:40,710
还有灾难 人们有危险 人们需要帮助
But a disaster, with people in danger, people who need help...

1051
01:45:40,740 --> 01:45:45,730
天 我知道你就是无法抗拒  那就像是你的罩门
I just knew you couldn't resist that chance to sort of pitch in.

1052
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:47,850
明白我的意思吗?
You know what I mean?

1053
01:46:21,220 --> 01:46:24,430
身强体壮对你很好 超人
There's a strong streak of good in you, Superman.

1054
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:27,270
但没有人是十全十美的
But then nobody's perfect.

1055
01:46:30,730 --> 01:46:32,110
几乎没有人是
Almost nobody.

1056
01:46:41,370 --> 01:46:42,700
- 哦 超人 - 天啊

Don't sit there like a numskull, get out!

1059

我想是他来了 路梭先生

他绝对是来了 路梭先生
He's definitely coming, Mr. Luthor.

门是开着的 请进
It's open, come in.

1062
01:47:32,470 --> 01:47:35,760
我的律师会因门的损坏和你连络
My attorney will be in touch with you about the damage to the door.

1063
01:47:35,890 --> 01:47:41,770
欧帝斯 侍候他脱披风
Otis, take the gentleman's cape.

1064
01:47:43,480 --> 01:47:45,270
我不认为他想我去弄 路梭先生
I don't think he wants me to, Mr. Luthor.

1065
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:46,780
好了 路梭 毒气工厂在那里?
Where's the gas pellet?

1066
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:48,320
在某个地方
Somewhere.

1067
01:47:50,570 --> 01:47:52,570
事实上是在我的脑海里
It's in the back of my mind, actually.

1068
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:55,580
那只是我的一个主意
It's a little idea I was toying with.

1069
01:47:55,660 --> 01:47:58,370
那是让你那样的聪明大脑得到灵感的方法?
Is that how a warped brain like yours gets its kicks?

1070
01:47:58,450 --> 01:48:00,660
一个让无辜的人死亡的计划
By planning the death of innocent people?

1071
01:48:01,620 --> 01:48:03,470
我造成无辜的人死亡

As you may or may not know, I am, as they say...

1076
01:48:24,610 --> 01:48:26,440
我在房地产上投资颇大
...very heavy into real estate.

1077
01:48:27,070 --> 01:48:31,500
在那一行想要挣钱 你就得低买高卖 对吧?
To make money, you have to buy for a little and sell for a lot, right?

1078
01:48:31,700 --> 01:48:32,660
对
Right.

1079
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:35,700

更有价值?
...and the time you sell it?

1082
01:48:42,620 --> 01:48:44,540
这里是加州
Now this is California.

1083
01:48:45,210 --> 01:48:47,460
是合众国中最受欢迎的州
The richest, most populous state in the Union.

1084
01:48:47,550 --> 01:48:49,710
我不必向你上地理课 路梭
I don't need a geography lesson from you.

1085
01:48:50,670 --> 01:48:54,770
是的 你当然去过那 我的确忘了你能到处跑 对吧?
Of course, you've been there. I do forget, you get around, don't you?

1086
01:48:54,970 --> 01:48:55,970
我说到那了?
Where was I?

1087
01:48:56,510 --> 01:48:58,140
- 加州 - 加州 对的

01:49:01,060 --> 01:49:03,240
是的 是两块大陆接合之处
Yes. It's the joining together of two land masses.

1090
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:07,620
那是加州常常有地震的原因
The fault line is shifting, which is why you get earthquakes in California.

1091
01:49:07,820 --> 01:49:10,870
太好了 我自己也不能说的更好
Wonderful! Couldn't have said it better myself.

1092
01:49:11,070 --> 01:49:15,250
任何在此线以西的东西 是世上最富有最昂贵的房地产
Everything west of this line is the richest, most expensive real estate in the world.

1093
01:49:15,450 --> 01:49:18,030
圣地牙哥 洛杉矶 旧金山
San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco.

1094
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:20,040
在这
Everything on this side of the line...

1095
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:23,050
毫无价值的沙漠
...is just hundreds of miles of worthless desert land...

1096
01:49:23,250 --> 01:49:25,500
刚巧拥有人是…
...which just happens to be owned by...

1097
01:49:25,620 --> 01:49:28,800
赖克斯路梭企业
Lex Luthor Incorporated.

1098
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:33,310
现在 叫我愚笨的 不负责任的
Now, call me foolish, call me irresponsible.

1099
01:49:33,510 --> 01:49:36,550
对我而言 五百万吨的炸弹
It occurs to me that a 500-megaton bomb...

1100
01:49:36,890 --> 01:49:39,480
计划落在适当的点 
...planted at just the proper point would...

1101
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:41,890
会毁灭了大半个加州
Would destroy most of California.

1102
01:49:43,430 --> 01:49:46,990
数百万无辜的人会死于非命 我们所知道的西岸会…
Millions of people would be killed and the West Coast as we know it would...

1103
01:49:47,190 --> 01:49:51,410
沉入海底 再见 加州 
Fall into the sea. Bye-bye, California.

1104
01:49:51,610 --> 01:49:54,200
哈罗 新的西岸 我的西岸 
Hello, new West Coast. My West Coast.

1105
01:49:56,860 --> 01:49:58,830
赖克斯海岸 路梭维尔
Costa Del Lex, Luthorville.

1106
01:49:59,030 --> 01:50:03,460
马瑞娜达拉斯 欧帝斯堡
Marina Del Lex, Otisburg.

1107
01:50:03,660 --> 01:50:04,910
欧帝斯堡?
"Otisburg"?

1108
01:50:05,080 --> 01:50:07,420
黛丝马克小姐的区域 她把她的范围切一些给我
Miss Teschmacher, she's got her own place.

1109
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:08,420
欧帝斯堡?
"Otisburg"?

1110
01:50:08,710 --> 01:50:10,180
是一个小小的地方
It's a little bitty place.

1111
01:50:10,380 --> 01:50:11,380
欧帝斯堡?
Otisburg?

1112
01:50:12,710 --> 01:50:15,010
好 我把它擦掉 如此而己 
I'll just wipe it off, that's all.

1113
01:50:15,130 --> 01:50:16,730
你是个梦想者 赖克斯路梭
You're a dreamer, Lex Luthor.

1114
01:50:16,930 --> 01:50:20,350
恶心的 扭曲的梦想者  你的计划根本不可能行的通
A sick, twisted dreamer. Your plan couldn't possibly work.

1115
01:50:20,550 --> 01:50:22,640
我承认我们有几个问题
I'll admit there were a few problems.

1116
01:50:23,100 --> 01:50:26,030
但只是绝对无误的着弹点
Adjusting the precise trajectory of the missile.

1117
01:50:26,230 --> 01:50:29,310
找到断层本身的压力点
Finding the optimum stress point for the fault line itself...

1118
01:50:30,060 --> 01:50:32,780
顺便一提 它就是…
...which, by the way, is target zero. Right...

1119
01:50:32,980 --> 01:50:37,940
就在…这里 
...here.

1120
01:51:01,260 --> 01:51:02,930
那是不可能的
That's impossible!

1121
01:51:04,890 --> 01:51:06,600
发生了什么事?上尉
What's happening, Lieutenant?

1122
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:10,360
导航系统失控 长官
Trajectory malfunction, sir.

1123
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:11,440
引爆
Abort.

1124
01:51:12,440 --> 01:51:13,900
所有计数器控制单位量
All counter control units...

1125
01:51:13,980 --> 01:51:16,110
把真空压力移到最大
... remove vacuum pressure to maximum.

1126
01:51:18,490 --> 01:51:19,820
没有作用 长官
Function negative, sir.

1127
01:51:19,910 --> 01:51:21,240
你不能把它击落吗?
Can't you knock them down?

1128
01:51:21,320 --> 01:51:26,000
完全不可能 长官 它们有新型的B20 低空回避系统
Absolutely impossible, sir. They have the new P-20 low-level avoidance systems.

1129
01:51:26,040 --> 01:51:27,500
给我接五角大厦
Get me the Pentagon.

1130
01:51:34,550 --> 01:51:37,430
如何?你认为如何?超人宝贝 有趣吗?
What do you think, super baby? Interesting?

1131
01:51:37,630 --> 01:51:39,760
你的理论令人印象深刻 路梭
Your theory's quite impressive, Luthor.

1132
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:42,140
欧帝斯 请到美容室去 好吗?
Would you go to the viewing room, please?

1133
01:51:42,970 --> 01:51:45,770
但其他的部份只是幻想而己
But as for the rest, it's nothing but a sick fantasy.

1134
01:51:45,970 --> 01:51:46,850
幻想?
Fantasy?

1135
01:51:47,180 --> 01:51:48,140
不
No.

1136
01:51:49,190 --> 01:51:51,520
是历史 在发生中 超人
It's history. It's happening, Superman.

1137
01:51:52,310 --> 01:51:53,980
黛丝马克小姐
Miss Teschmacher!

1138
01:51:58,740 --> 01:51:59,990
什么事?赖克斯
Yes, Lex?

1139
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:01,780
火箭现在在那里?
Where's the rocket now?

1140
01:52:01,990 --> 01:52:05,660
在大峡谷上像是扁幅一般
It's going like a bat over the Grand Canyon, so is the other one.

1141
01:52:05,780 --> 01:52:06,830
另一枚也是另一枚?
The other one?

1142
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:08,500
有两枚?
There are two of them?

1143
01:52:11,540 --> 01:52:13,830
是的 超人 双重保证 
Yes, Superman, double jeopardy.

1144
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:17,550
即使是你与你伟大的速度 也无法阻止两枚
Even you, with your great speed, couldn't stop both of them.

1145
01:52:17,670 --> 01:52:21,020
但是我 另一方面来说 能用我的导向仪阻止它们
While I, on the other hand, could stop them with my detonator.

1146
01:52:21,220 --> 01:52:23,010
好了 路梭 它在那里?
All right, Luthor, where is it?

1147
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:25,140
导向仪在哪?
Where's the detonator?

1148
01:52:38,650 --> 01:52:40,150
你这个神经病
Diseased maniac!

1149
01:52:40,690 --> 01:52:45,080
你真的以为用铅做的箱子就能够躲过我了吗?
Do you think you could hide it from me by encasing it in lead?

1150
01:52:45,740 --> 01:52:48,120
我把这箱子做成你的监狱铁
I'll mold this box into your prison bars.

1151
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:49,370
别碰那个
Don't touch that.

1152
01:52:56,210 --> 01:52:57,250
我告诉过你了
I told you.

1153
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,260
那是克莱顿陨石 超人
It's Kryptonite.

1154
01:52:59,670 --> 01:53:01,630
一点由你家乡来的纪念品
A little souvenir from your hometown.

1155
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:09,090
我没任何花费就让你像回家一般
I've spared no expense to make you feel at home.

1156
01:53:12,060 --> 01:53:13,600
你在你的时代是伟大的 超人
You were great in your day.

1157
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:16,400
但那有个原因
But it just stands to reason...

1158
01:53:16,730 --> 01:53:18,980
当你气数己尽的时候
...when it came time to cash in your chips...

1159
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:23,950
那个出卖的 有病的神经病 会变成你的保管者
...this old diseased maniac would be your banker.

1160
01:53:28,410 --> 01:53:29,540
心智驾凌肌肉了?
Mind over muscle.

1161
01:53:38,170 --> 01:53:42,300
你根本不在乎另一枚飞弹击中那里 对吧?
You don't even care where the other missile's headed, do you?

1162
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:43,920
我当然在乎 
Certainly I do.

1163
01:53:45,430 --> 01:53:47,300
我晓得它要击中的准确地点
I know exactly where it's headed.

1164
01:53:47,430 --> 01:53:48,890
新泽西州的哈肯赛
Hackensack, New Jersey.

1165
01:53:54,690 --> 01:53:59,150
我现在得离开你了 不伤感情 我们都有我们的小错误
I have to leave you now. No hard feelings. We all have our little faults.

1166
01:53:59,860 --> 01:54:06,150
我的是加州
Mine's in California.

1167
01:54:16,210 --> 01:54:22,170
赖克斯 我妈往在哈肯赛

1172
01:55:25,690 --> 01:55:27,490
求你 你不能…
Please, you can't...

1173
01:55:28,070 --> 01:55:33,130
你不能只是站在那 
...you can't just stand there.

1174
01:55:33,330 --> 01:55:38,510
你不能只是站在那里 让无辜的人 几百万无辜的人死
You can't just stand and let millions of innocent people die.

1175
01:55:38,710 --> 01:55:39,540
也许
Maybe.

1176
01:55:41,540 --> 01:55:44,040
求你 求你帮我去救他们 
Please, help me to save them.

1177
01:55:46,090 --> 01:55:48,590
若是我帮你 你保证先救我妈?
Would you promise to save my mother first?

1178
01:55:49,720 --> 01:55:51,680
露…露易丝和吉米

1179
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:53,430
但是要先救我妈 若你答应我

我会相信你 因为一向都说实话
If you promise, I'll believe you because you always tell the truth.

1181
01:55:59,390 --> 01:56:01,020
好 我答应你 我答应你
I promise, I promise.

1182
01:56:55,360 --> 01:57:00,320
你…为什么先吻我呢?
Why did you kiss me first?

1183
01:57:00,870 --> 01:57:03,120
是因为我想待会你不会吻我
I didn't think you'd let me later.

1184
01:57:04,420 --> 01:57:06,300
谢谢 黛丝马克小姐
Thank you, Miss Teschmacher.

1185
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:12,340
我为何和好人无法相处的好呢?
Why is it I can't get it on with the good guys?

1186
01:57:15,640 --> 01:57:22,350
现在站到一边去吧  我也不要你留在这边
Stand aside now. I wouldn't stay here, either.

Please, come on, turn over.

1224
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:03,790
快呀 
Come on!

1225
02:05:31,150 --> 02:05:33,990
救我 救我 不要 求你 
Help me. Help me, please.

1226
02:05:34,700 --> 02:05:39,660
不
No.

1227
02:10:45,010 --> 02:10:46,690
吾儿
My son.

1228
02:10:46,890 --> 02:10:49,010
你禁止干预人类的历史 
It is forbidden for you to interfere...

1229
02:10:49,550 --> 02:10:54,980
我只知道一件事 吾儿 你来这是有原因的
There's one thing I do know, Son, and that is you are here for a reason.

1230
02:10:55,140 --> 02:10:56,230
你禁止干预人类的历史
It is forbidden.

1231
02:10:56,310 --> 02:10:59,150
我能做那么多的事 所有的力量
All those things I can do. All those powers...

1232
02:11:00,190 --> 02:11:01,990
你禁止干预人类的历史 但我却不能救活她
... but I couldn't even save him.

1233
02:11:06,150 --> 02:11:07,610
是禁止的
It is forbidden.

1234
02:12:33,030 --> 02:12:33,780
嘿 
Hi.

1235
02:12:35,830 --> 02:12:37,330
别麻烦了 我想是熄火了
Don't bother, it's dead.

1236
02:12:39,500 --> 02:12:40,500
当然是熄火了
Sure it's dead.

1237
02:12:42,460 --> 02:12:45,760
男人的问题是你需要他们时 一个都不见了
The problem with men of steel is they're never around when you want one.

1238
02:12:45,960 --> 02:12:48,670
你知道当你到处在飞的时候 我发生了什么事吗?
Do you know what happened while you were off flying around?

1239
02:12:48,760 --> 02:12:52,550
我几乎在地震之中 有加油站在我的车旁爆炸
I was almost in an earthquake. A gas station blew up beside my car.

1240
02:12:52,640 --> 02:12:56,510
有电话杆倒的满路都是 我几乎死了
Telephone poles falling all over the road. I was almost killed.

1241
02:12:56,600 --> 02:12:59,730
而想谈谈这整件事 而这笨车却没有了油 
To top the whole thing off, this stupid car runs out of gas.

1242
02:12:59,930 --> 02:13:01,440
对那个我很抱歉 露易丝
I'm sorry about that, Lois.

1243
02:13:01,900 --> 02:13:03,940
但我忙了一阵子
But I've been kind of busy for a while.

1244
02:13:06,690 --> 02:13:08,860
对不起 没关系的
I'm sorry, that's all right.

1245
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:22,370
多谢了 超人
Thanks a lot, Superman.

1246
02:13:22,620 --> 02:13:25,130
在地震时期 把我放在前不着村后不着店之处
Put me in the middle of nowhere during an earthquake.

1247
02:13:25,210 --> 02:13:29,140
没有食物 没有水 到处是蛇 我不晓得你是否会回头来接我
No food, no water, snakes everywhere. I had no idea if you were coming back.

1248
02:13:30,170 --> 02:13:31,140
嘿 超人
Hey, superman.

1249
02:13:31,470 --> 02:13:36,770
听我说 我还有件事必需要做  我们回头见
There's something I have to do. I'll see you later.

1250
02:13:36,970 --> 02:13:38,470
在一个地方待不上一秒钟
He can't stay still for a second.

1251
02:13:41,600 --> 02:13:45,150
老天 依连小姐 肯先生不在这看这一切真是可惜
Golly, Miss Lane, it's too bad Mr. Kent wasn't here to see all this.

1252
02:13:45,230 --> 02:13:49,160
是呀 可怜的克拉克 他从来不在 当超…
Yeah, poor Clark. He's never around when...

1253
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:51,490
克拉克?等一等 等一等 
Clark... Wait a minute.

1254
02:13:51,860 --> 02:13:52,700
什么事?
What?

1255
02:13:54,240 --> 02:13:56,200
坦白说那是个最笨的主意
Lois Lane, that is the silliest idea.

1256
02:13:56,660 --> 02:14:00,550
你知道吗? 让我告诉你一件事 依连小姐 我认为他真的关心你
I'll tell you something, Miss Lane. I think he really cares about you.

1257
02:14:00,750 --> 02:14:06,160
克拉克 他当然关心 不是克拉克
- Clark? Of course, he does. - No, not Clark.

1258
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
这个 超人关心每一个人 吉米
Superman cares about everybody, Jimmy.

1259
02:14:10,170 --> 02:14:13,590
但 谁晓得 那一天 某幸运儿
But who knows. Someday, if he's lucky...

1260
02:14:26,940 --> 02:14:28,440
你弄坏了我的西装
You're messing up my suit!

1261
02:14:32,900 --> 02:14:35,320
欧帝斯 小心地面 你...
Otis! Watch the ground, you...

1262
02:14:36,200 --> 02:14:37,620
晚安 典狱长
Good evening, Warden.

1263
02:14:37,700 --> 02:14:40,750
我想这两个人在公平审判之前 和你在一起是够安全的
These two men should be safe here 'til they can get a fair trial.

1264
02:14:40,950 --> 02:14:42,200
他们是谁?超人
Who is it, Superman?

1265
02:14:44,580 --> 02:14:45,500
赖克斯路梭
Lex Luthor.

1266
02:14:46,080 --> 02:14:48,710
是我们时代中最伟大的犯罪心智
- The greatest criminal mind of our time. - Of our time.

1267
02:14:48,790 --> 02:14:51,090
我们的时代 这是我个人的通知
- I hereby serve notice... - He's serving notice to you.

1268
02:14:51,170 --> 02:14:52,800
这些围墙
...that these walls...

1269
02:14:53,130 --> 02:14:54,060
请你闭上嘴 好吗?
Will you shut up, you fat little fool!

1270
02:14:54,260 --> 02:14:55,220
好了 把他们带走 孩子们

1271
02:14:55,300 --> 02:14:56,510
你 你 别再打我 在牢里了
You, you nitwit!

1272
02:14:56,800 --> 02:14:57,930
傻瓜
Nincompoop!

1273
02:14:58,340 --> 02:14:59,550
这个国家
This country...

1274
02:14:59,640 --> 02:15:02,570
再度安全了 超人 谢谢你 
...is safe again, Superman, thanks to you.

1275
02:15:02,770 --> 02:15:03,520

No, sir.

1276
02:15:03,600 --> 02:15:04,930
别谢我 典狱长
Don't thank me, Warden.

1277
02:15:05,390 --> 02:15:07,190
我们全是同一队中的一部份
We're all part of the same team.

1278
02:15:07,600 --> 02:15:08,610
晚安
