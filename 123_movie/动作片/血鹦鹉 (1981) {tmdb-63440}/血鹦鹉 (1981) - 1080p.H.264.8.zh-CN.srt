1
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:32,256
Of the world of spirits,

2
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:37,762
in order to celebrate the birthday of the demon king,

3
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:44,197
they use their blood and change it to a Bloody Parrot

4
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:49,173
If you have the luck to meet it,

5
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:53,507
it'll offer you three wishes

6
00:01:53,613 --> 00:02:01,179
to fulfill whatever you want

7
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:03,811
有一年
Once Prince of Dian is

8
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:05,413
滇王府预备朝贡
preparing to pay tribute to the imperial court

9
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:08,085
当今天子的十三箱珠宝
The thirteen caskets of treasures to the king

10
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,458
在一夜间突然失踪
all disappeared within one night

11
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:13,999
王爷闻讯，焦虑万分
The Prince is perturbed at the news

12
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,536
下令总管郭繁彻夜搜查
and decreed Chief Guo Fan to search at once

13
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:54,903
当你见到我，就会得到三个愿望
When you see me you'll get 3 wishes;

14
00:02:55,008 --> 00:03:03,643
只要活着，你的愿望就会实现
and as long as you live your wishes will come true

15
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,953
你真的有灵就替我…
If you are that good then...

16
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:11,888
替我找回王府失窃的十三箱珠宝
then help me retrieve the 13 cases of lost treasures

17
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,650
血鹦鹉果然将王府所失的
The Bloody Parrot has indeed

18
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,559
十三箱珍宝都找回
recovered the lost treasures

19
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:20,690
实现了郭总管的第一个愿望
and fulfilled chief Guo's first wish

20
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:24,262
失去的珠宝都找回来了
The lost treasures have been found

21
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:28,140
不好啦，郭公子坠马死了
Bad news, master Guo died from falling off his horse

22
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:35,447
儿子…
Son...

23
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:48,283
我要你把我儿子的命还给我
Give me back my son

24
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,794
把我儿子的命还给我
Give me back my son

25
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,088
"The grave of my beloved son, Guo Jia Zhong"

26
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,437
你真的相信这种事
You really believe in such rumors?

27
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,679
你真的相信一只鹦鹉
You really believe a parrot

28
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:11,272
能使你的儿子复活
could bring your son back to life?

29
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,284
宝库失窃，卑职的责任最大
I am highly responsible for the lost treasures

30
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,324
嫌疑也最大
and suffer the greatest suspicion too

31
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,622
现在失窃的珠宝已寻回
The lost treasures have now been retrieved

32
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:27,689
犬子是否能复活都已经不重要了
it doesn't matter whether my son can come alive

33
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:32,599
我相信你的忠心
I believe in your loyalty

34
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:36,505
也希望你的儿子能够复生
and also hope your son could be brought back to life

35
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,100
可是，啊…
But...

36
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:18,645
你不要放他出来
Don't let him out

37
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:19,775
你不能放他出来
You can't let him out

38
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:22,684
他已经死了，已经变成鬼了
He's dead, he's a ghost now

39
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:29,254
儿子复活了，我儿子复活了
My son's come back to life

40
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,293
你简直是疯了你
You must be mad

41
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:48,038
珠宝不见了…
The jewelry is gone...

42
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,072
自从滇王府那批珠宝失踪后
Since those jewelry disappeared

43
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,944
本来已经平静多年的江湖
what might have been a tranquil time

44
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,574
从此也就骚动起来
became a tumultuous period

45
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:28,245
为了这批价值连城的珠宝
To lay their hands on this treasure

46
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:32,620
各门各派都在追查血鹦鹉的真相
martial artists tried to track down the Bloody Parrot

47
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:36,320
他们因为互相猜忌而导致残杀
They killed each other for this

48
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:39,364
由于残杀而引起仇恨
and hatred was generated

49
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:42,957
更因仇恨而又互相杀戮
Then hatred gave rise to more killings

50
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,300
可是血鹦鹉的秘密和珠宝的下落
However the Bloody Parrot and the treasure

51
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,340
却始终是一个谜
remained a mystery

52
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:15,723
你是什么人？为什么要杀我？说
Who are you? Why do you want to kill me?

53
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:18,235
滇王府的珠宝
The Jewellery of the Prince of Dian

54
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:24,173
江湖上的人都说是…是你…
Everybody says it's you... it's you

55
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,344
"Dian border"

56
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,334
"Dian House"

57
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,492
你是鬼还是人
Are you a ghost or a man?

58
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,229
我是个将死的人，还没有变成鬼
I am the one who's about to die and as yet not a ghost

59
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,269
是谁害你的
Who harmed you?

60
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:30,138
是你…
It's you...

61
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,506
我怎么害你的？我自己都不知道
Me? I don't know that

62
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,380
你刚才看见什么
What did you see just now?

63
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,385
一道红光，在这边闪耀着
A streak of red light, shimmering over here

64
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:45,014
你知道那是什么
Do you know what that is?

65
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,318
不知道
No

66
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,293
你当然不知道
Of course you don't

67
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,954
因为那红光一出现
When that red light appears,

68
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:53,531
血鹦鹉很快就出现了
the Bloody Parrot will soon appear as well

69
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,464
这只不过是传说而已
It's just a rumour

70
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,627
不，有人看见
No, someone has seen it happen

71
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:58,704
谁？
Who?

72
00:08:58,804 --> 00:08:59,736
郭繁
Guo Fan

73
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,568
就是滇王府一夜之间
Is he the Chief of the residence of the Prince of Dian

74
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,505
失去那批珠宝的郭总管
who lost all the jewellery in a night?

75
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:04,974
是
That's him

76
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:08,535
那么那批珠宝到哪里去了？
Where's all the jewellery?

77
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,639
你赶快离开这里
You'd better hurry and leave

78
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,411
血鹦鹉它…
the Bloody Parrot...

79
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:14,486
那批珠宝到哪儿去了？
Where's all the jewellery?

80
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,288
血鹦鹉
The Bloody Parrot

81
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,489
血鹦鹉？
The Bloody Parrot?

82
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:49,616
你是谁？
Who are you?

83
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:50,347
铁恨
Tie Hen

84
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:53,016
中原名捕铁手无情铁恨就是你
Are you the famous constable Tie Hen the Merciless?

85
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:53,648
不错
That's me

86
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,248
你来找谁？
Who are you looking for?

87
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,156
郭简
Guo Kan

88
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,421
找他干什么？
What for?

89
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,555
他是郭繁的兄弟，郭家唯一的活口
He's Guo Fan's brother, the family's only survivor

90
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:00,962
只有他才能告诉我
Only he can tell me

91
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,365
滇王府失窃那批珠宝的下落
where the lost jewellery of the Prince of Dian is

92
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:04,731
可惜你来迟了
But you're late

93
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:05,826
什么
What?

94
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,211
死因你找出来没有
Have you found out the cause of his death?

95
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,016
他是被毒死的
He was poisoned

96
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,925
你看我叶霆风像个下毒的人吗
Do I look like someone who uses poison?

97
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,692
我相信你不会
I don't think you would, but that's because

98
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:11,327
因为他还没有说出那批珠宝的下落
he hadn't told you the whereabouts of the treasure

99
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:16,468
如果他说了你以为我就会下毒
Do you think I'd use poison if he had?

100
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,065
很难说
Difficult to say

101
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:26,477
他临死之前究竟还说了些什么
What did he say before he died?

102
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,413
我为什么要告诉你
Why should I tell you?

103
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:36,895
因为只有我才能证明你没有下毒
Because, only I can prove your innocence

104
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,391
他说出了三个字
He uttered 3 words

105
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:41,363
什么字
What?

106
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:42,934
血鹦鹉
The Bloody Parrot

107
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:44,792
血鹦鹉
The Bloody Parrot?

108
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,703
我绝不相信血鹦鹉这种事
I don't believe in such a rumor

109
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:57,147
我只相信天网恢恢，疏而不漏
I only believe that nothing escapes justice

110
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,017
剖开
Cut it open

111
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,503
你是识货的人
You know your stuff,

112
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,869
应该看得出这是什么
you should know what this is

113
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:27,645
这是避毒珠，专克五毒
This is an anti-poison pellet

114
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,874
这也是王府失窃的珠宝
and it is also the lost jewelry

115
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:31,574
他身上既然有避毒珠
Since he kept it

116
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,515
怎么会中毒而死
how could he have died of poison?

117
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,582
有些毒走经脉血管
Some poisons run in the arteries

118
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,451
有些毒走六月府五脏
some in the organs;

119
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,387
本来就不相干
they don't interfere with each other

120
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:47,794
这件案子另有主谋
There's someone behind this case

121
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,027
他是被人灭口的
His murder was to silence him

122
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,798
主言某人会是谁？
Who is the mastermind?

123
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,633
其实只要找到一样东西
In fact if we could find one thing

124
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,574
这件案子你想不破都不行
you could easily solve the case

125
00:12:58,677 --> 00:12:59,268
找什么？
What is that?

126
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:01,505
鹦鹉，血鹦鹉
The Bloody Parrot

127
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,845
血鹦鹉？
The Bloody Parrot?

128
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:23,597
这个东西走得真快，真邪门
It runs away so quickly

129
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:27,434
就算你追上了，是祸是福也很难说
Even if you caught up with it, it may not be a blessing

130
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,168
祸福由天、生死由命
Fate and death are out of our control

131
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,107
我了解你的心情
I understand how you feel

132
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,771
自你进入了六扇门
Since you entered the cult of the Six Fans

133
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:38,873
死在你手下的不下有七八十人
70 to 80 people have died at your hands

134
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,652
我从来没有枉杀一个人
I have never killed anyone unjustifiably

135
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:46,623
可是你杀的毕竟是活生生的人
Nevertheless, you have killed

136
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,691
你双手沾满了血腥
and your hands are tainted with blood

137
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:53,424
想洗你也洗不干净了
You can't wash off your responsibility

138
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:59,627
我真是不明白你究竟想说些什么
I can't figure out what you are trying to say

139
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,070
血鹦鹉
The Bloody Parrot

140
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:45,549
要是你还把我当作朋友
If you still regard me as your friend

141
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:58,358
叶兄，请把我的尸体运回边寨
please send my body back to the border

142
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,125
"Spirtual Tablet of Tie Hen"

143
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,716
铁捕头是怎么死的
How did constable Tie die?

144
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:29,623
中毒
He was poisoned

145
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:30,820
中什么毒
What poison did he die of?

146
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,261
不知道
I don't know

147
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,525
难道连老先生都查不出
Even you can't figure it out?

148
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:35,998
只要是人杀了他
As long as the murderer is a human being

149
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,661
无论用什么方法我都能查出
I could use whatever means to figure it out

150
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,534
难道凶手不是人
So the murderer is not human?

151
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,970
绝不是
No

152
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,213
客倌，里边请
Sir, inside please

153
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:53,410
好
Thanks

154
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,518
哎，你看
Look

155
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,821
这里是酒店还是棺村c
Is this a tavern or a coffin shop?

156
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,694
小店只卖酒不卖棺村
We only sell wine, not coffins

157
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,097
那怎么会有棺村？
So why is there a coffin here?

158
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:10,998
这是那位客倌带来的
That gentleman brought it here

159
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,503
而且他一定要放在这里
and insisted on putting it here

160
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,701
这杯酒轮到我，我干了
My turn to toast

161
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,540
喂，里面有什么
Hey, what's inside?

162
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,710
我跟你说话
I'm talking to you

163
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,980
里边是我朋友
My friend is in there

164
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,318
是死朋友还是活朋友
Is he dead or alive?

165
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,488
只要是朋友，死活都是朋友
Doesn't matter, he is still my friend

166
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:36,527
死人还会喝酒
Do dead people drink?

167
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,433
现在轮到你干了，我替你喝了
It's your turn, I'll drink for you

168
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:49,233
这人是疯子，你看怎么样
He's nuts, what do you think?

169
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,501
把他踢出去
Kick him out

170
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,411
我这个朋友活着的时候就喜欢踢人
When my friend was alive he liked kicking people

171
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,887
从来没有被人踢过
He was never kicked

172
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,584
死了一定也不喜欢被人踢的
he wouldn't like being kicked either though he's dead

173
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:16,935
只要我多用半分力
If I used a little more strength

174
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,197
你的手就永远不能再拿武器了
your hand would have become crippled

175
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:15,759
血鹦鹉
The Bloody Parrot

176
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:26,096
小魔神，小魔神死了…
The little devil is dead...

177
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,695
这个鹦鹉叫小魔神？
This parrot is called the little devil?

178
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,034
是啊
Yes

179
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,267
是你替他取的名字？
You thought up the name?

180
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,809
不，是个女孩子
No, a girl did

181
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:35,846
她送给我的时候就有了这个名字
The name came along when she gave it to me

182
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,609
她是什么人
Who was she?

183
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:44,318
我这一辈子都是规规矩矩的
I have always behaved myself

184
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,914
可是我却荒唐过一次
all my life except once;

185
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:50,188
那一次把我一生的积蓄都花光了
And that cost me my life's savings

186
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:53,196
可是她给我得到的满足和刺激
But the pleasure and excitement she gave me

187
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,028
是别人连做梦都想不到的
was out of this world

188
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,762
她在什么地方
Where is she?

189
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,032
那只不过是一间妓院
It was only a whore house

190
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:00,833
哪家妓院
Which one?

191
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:02,372
鹦鹉楼
The Parrot Brothel

192
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,270
她叫什么名字
What was her name?

193
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,808
血奴
Xue Nu

194
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,434
血奴
Xue Nu?

195
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:41,636
这棺村里装的是死人还是银子
Is a dead body in the coffin or is there silver?

196
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,112
死人也好银子也好
Doesn't matter

197
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:44,307
这家伙一定是疯子
He's got to be a nut

198
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,385
是嘛，哪有人带着棺村逛窑子的
Indeed... who else'd carry a coffin to a brothel

199
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,152
那疯子上血奴房去了
He's gone up to Xue Nu's room

200
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:50,846
血奴不会喜欢一个疯子的
She wouldn't like a nutcase

201
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:54,517
是，这个疯子哪儿比得上严公子强
Indeed, how could he compare with master Yian

202
00:19:58,163 --> 00:19:59,255
红玉姑娘
Miss Hong Yu

203
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:12,829
奇怪
Strange

204
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:20,139
你是…
You are...

205
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,044
你不要管我是谁
Never mind who I am

206
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,342
我想问你
I want to ask you

207
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:28,283
你到这里来是想找哪位姑娘陪你
which lady are you looking for?

208
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:31,817
血奴
Xue Nu

209
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:37,461
你这个人真怪，用棺村装银子
You're a strange guy; using a coffin to put your silver

210
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:42,256
这口棺村里一分银子都没有
There's no silver in the coffin

211
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:45,536
那是个死人
You mean that's a dead person?

212
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,672
我只知道他是我朋友
All I know is he's my friend;

213
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:51,436
至于是死是活那并不重要
it doesn't matter whether he's dead or alive

214
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,637
你至少还应该知道一件事
You should at least know one thing

215
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:54,803
什么事
What?

216
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:59,543
今天晚上是死人留下还是你留下
Whether you or the dead person will stay behind

217
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,345
有什么区别
What's the difference?

218
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:05,048
要是活人就得付钱，死人我免誉
If alive, then you'll have to pay, if dead, it's free

219
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:09,956
这样看起来只有他留下，我出去了
Looks like I'll be the one leaving

220
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,156
那又何必这么急呢
Why so impatient?

221
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,493
如果我不出去
If I don't go out,

222
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,533
我身上有一件东西就要出去了
something on me will

223
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,296
什么东西
What?

224
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:20,136
你看
Look

225
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,071
夜明珠
Night pearl?

226
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,955
现在你可以留下了
Now you can stay

227
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:24,027
你为什么在墙上画这些可怕的画
Why have you drawn such horrible pictures on the wall?

228
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:25,831
我喜欢要人害怕
I like to frighten people

229
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,666
害怕也是一种刺激
Fear is a stimulation

230
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:30,333
常常能刺激得男人发狂
and drives men crazy

231
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,842
这些妖魔在干什么
What are these devils doing?

232
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:35,139
在庆贺魔王的寿辰
Celebrating the devil king's birthday

233
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:36,342
这是魔王
This is the devil king?

234
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,676
是的
Yes

235
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:41,810
可是今天晚上你就是我的魔王
You are my devil tonight

236
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:45,653
这只鹦鹉为什么是红的
Why is this parrot red?

237
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,247
他是魔血滴成的
It has been formed by the devil's blood

238
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,224
围绕在他身边的十三只怪物
And the 13 monsters surrounding her

239
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:51,921
就是他的奴才叫血奴
are her slaves and called Xue Nu

240
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,258
你想做他的奴才
You want to be its slave

241
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,230
所以改名叫血奴，是吗？
hence your name, right?

242
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:58,427
今天晚上我只想做你的奴才
I only want to be your slave tonight

243
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:38,601
所有的魔血都滴成这只血鹦鹉
All the devil's blood has been used up to make this

244
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,041
和十三个血奴？
Bloody Parrot & the 13 slaves?

245
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,308
不，另有十三滴血结成了石头
No, another 13 drops of blood made a stone

246
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:46,782
在一瞬间它就可以夺人魂魄的石头
which could seize one's soul in a wink

247
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:49,945
这种石头就叫做血石
It's called bloody rock

248
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:53,547
是不是这种石头？
Is this it?

249
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:57,187
啊！血石
Bloody rock

250
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:20,407
我就可以见到魔王
I could see the Devil King

251
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:50,109
这个女人是我的
This woman is mine

252
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:55,118
你这个小杂种，给我滚开，给我滚
Bastard, scram

253
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:44,659
你这个魔鬼到底是谁，说
Who the devil are you? Speak

254
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:48,603
你这个小杂种，嫖了我的女人
Bastard, you got my woman

255
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:54,737
我要杀死你，我不会放过你的
I'll kill you

256
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,446
怎么？你没事吧？
Are you okay?

257
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:41,991
没什么，你真好
I'm fine. Very kind of you indeed

258
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:44,491
谁？
Who is it?

259
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,564
我没事了，你下去吧
I'm okay, you may leave

260
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:47,956
她是谁？
Who is she?

261
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:49,533
是我的乳娘
My wet nurse

262
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,700
现在我才知道
Now I know the stone you gave me

263
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:54,897
你给我的那块石头是春药
was an aphrodisiac

264
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:56,763
那你为什么说是魔石
Why did you say it was the devil's stone?

265
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,570
因为魔王和血鹦鹉的故事
Because the story of the devil and the Bloody Parrot

266
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,077
实在把我迷住了
fascinated me

267
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,477
我不喜欢这个故事
I don't like the story,

268
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:05,242
更不喜欢这幅画
and more so the picture

269
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,248
这画谁画的
Who drew this?

270
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,149
我不知道，听说是涵古斋褛的
I heard Han Gu Studio did that

271
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,484
我要去买白粉把它涂掉
I'll get some white powder and plaster over it

272
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,856
涵古斋的主人死了已有三年
The Han Gu Studio's owner has been dead for 3 years

273
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:22,296
涵古斋的店门也有三年没打开过
and his shop has not operated since then

274
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,129
你不是想买石灰吗
Do you want to buy lime powder?

275
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:26,931
趁我没有睡觉你还是可以买得到的
You can still get it before I sleep

276
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,471
你是谁
Who are you?

277
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,133
你怎么知道我要买石灰
How do you know what I want?

278
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:35,301
大家都叫我老蛔虫
Everyone calls me roundworm

279
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:43,250
怪不得你像我肚内的蛔虫
It's no wonder then, that

280
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:44,844
知道我想什么
you know my thoughts inside out

281
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:49,791
嗯，你要刷墙，要在这儿待下去
You want to plaster the wall and stay here

282
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:53,694
只可惜你一定待不久的
But you wouldn't stay long as

283
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:58,633
也许连墙都没干，你已经没命了
you might die before the wall dries

284
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:04,402
老板，有没有酒？
Boss, some wine?

285
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,637
对不起…
Sorry...

286
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:43,009
是谁叫你来杀我的？
Who asked you to come and kill me?

287
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,513
是我
I did

288
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:50,983
你想杀我？
You're after my life?

289
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,989
血奴要做生意
Xue Nu needs to do business

290
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:56,822
做生意的姑娘不能养小白脸
she can't afford to support a man

291
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:59,186
你凭什么这样说？
Why do you say this?

292
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,993
血奴从小吃我的奶长大
I brought her up

293
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,933
就该听我的
so she should listen to me

294
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:07,869
还好我吃奶的时间已经过了
I am past my weaning period

295
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:09,098
老太婆
Old madam,

296
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:11,767
你想开一点，别气坏了身子
don't boil with anger

297
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:17,175
这是你要的石灰
This is the lime powder you want

298
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:29,219
你也想杀我？
You want to kill me too?

299
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,555
是的
Yes

300
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,187
你也是为了血奴想杀我？
Also because of Xue Nu?

301
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:35,761
本来就有这个打算
That was my intention

302
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:38,893
看来你的身手还不错
You seem to have good skills

303
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,631
大概还能在我手上过三招
and could fight with me

304
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:43,297
啊？
Oh?

305
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:47,278
可是我还得警告你
But I must warn you

306
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:50,506
血奴本来就是我的
Xue Nu is mine

307
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:53,743
她要养小白脸，就得养我
If she supports a man, that should be me

308
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,548
我哪一点不比你强
You are not a better man than me

309
00:30:56,654 --> 00:31:00,750
只有一点，你的鼻子太扁了
Just marginally; your nose is a bit flat

310
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:11,433
现在看来你可真的变成了小白脸了
Now you really look like a gigolo

311
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,941
完了
I'm finished...

312
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,705
完了？还没完
Not yet

313
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,780
如果我再多赐你一招
If I cut you one more time,

314
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,325
你连做小白脸的资格都没有了
your handsome face will be ruined

315
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:39,330
滚
Get lost

316
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:43,864
夭灵灵地灵灵
Summoning the spirits

317
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:46,027
太上老君急急如令令
Lord Lao Zi of the Great Monad is potent and binding

318
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:48,037
夭灵灵地灵灵
Summoning the spirits

319
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:50,164
太上老君急急如令令
Lord Lao Zi of the Great Monad is potent and binding

320
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,606
割他的鼻子挖他的眼
Cut off his nose, gouge his eyes

321
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:53,506
掏他的五脏挖心肝
and eviscerate him

322
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:55,238
夭灵灵地灵灵
Summoning the spirits

323
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,314
太上老君急急如令令
Lord Lao Zi of the Great Monad is potent and binding

324
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,848
割他的鼻子挖他的眼
Cut off his nose, gouge his eyes

325
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,247
掏他的五脏挖心肝
and eviscerate him

326
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:03,445
把他的心掏出来喂狗
Take out his heart to feed the dogs

327
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,328
这个女人是一个巫婆
This woman is a witch

328
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,200
这里的人都很怕她
Even the people here are afraid of her

329
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:24,605
因为她的诅咒一向都很灵验
Because her curses are efficacious

330
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:27,837
只不过真正要杀你的人还不是她
It's just that she's not the one who wants to kill you

331
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:29,207
那是谁？
Who is it then?

332
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:31,009
李大娘
Madam Li

333
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:34,084
李大娘为什么要杀我？
Why does Madam Li want to kill me?

334
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:38,750
我只知道杀人从来不问为什么
I never ask why

335
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:43,827
你就是长剑高欢？
So you're Gao Huan, the Long Sword?

336
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:48,061
你还不动手？
Aren't you going to fight?

337
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,066
我不想这里发生更多事情
I don't want anything more to happen here

338
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:40,603
请你尽快离开平安颌
Please leave the town immediately

339
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:41,797
你是谁？
Who are you?

340
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:43,771
为什么用化尸水把尸体化去？
Why are you dissolving the corpse?

341
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:46,139
我叫安子豪，是这里的颌长
I am An Zhi Hao, the major of this town

342
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:49,304
因为有一个官职比我大几十倍
Because someone who is much higher in rank than I am

343
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:52,541
比铁恨更有名气的捕头将会来这里
and more famous than Tie Hen is going to be here soon

344
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,446
他是谁
Who is he?

345
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:55,416
常笑，常大人
Lord Chang, Chang Xiao

346
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,147
毒剑常笑
Chang Xiao, the Deadly Sword

347
00:35:57,788 --> 00:36:00,621
你是聪明人就应该尽快离开这里
You'd better be smart and leave quickly

348
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:02,749
谢谢你的忠告
Thanks for your advice

349
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,158
但是有一件事情我不明白
But there's still something which I don't understand

350
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:06,355
什么事
What is that?

351
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:09,627
李大娘是什么人？
Who is Madam Li?

352
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,565
她为什么要杀我？
Why does she want to kill me?

353
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:19,499
她…她是血奴的母亲
She's the mother of Xue Nu

354
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:23,046
血奴的母亲？为什么要杀我？
Xue Nu

355
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:41,597
李大娘？
Madam Li?

356
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,092
高欢死了
Guo Huan is dead

357
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,063
传话下去，不杀了叶霆风
Pass on my order that Ye Ting Feng must be killed

358
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:52,369
不要怪我李大娘不客气
or I'll have to be rude

359
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:28,438
你奶妈来过了？
Has your nanny been here?

360
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:31,344
没有，你一走我就睡了
No, I fell asleep after you left

361
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:35,709
你见过她？
Did you see her?

362
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:39,022
她想杀我
She's after my life

363
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:41,117
我到这儿才半天
I've been here for only half a day

364
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:43,693
这里所有人个个都想杀我
and everyone here wants to kill me

365
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:44,658
是不是他们之间
Wonder if there are any

366
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:47,094
都有什么不可告人的秘密？
secrets between them that I am not aware of?

367
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:53,096
你能不能带我去见一个人？
Could you bring me to meet someone?

368
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:54,694
谁啊？
Who?

369
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:57,535
我想见一下李大娘
Madam Li

370
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,502
你真的要见她？
You really want to see her?

371
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:03,079
你想干什么？
What do you want?

372
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,306
我要挖出你的眼睛
I'll gouge out your eyes;

373
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:05,609
看你还想不想见她
see if you still want to see her

374
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:06,808
为什么不让我去见她？
Why don't you let me see her?

375
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:08,077
她是个魔女
She's a witch

376
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:11,712
你只要见到她就永远不会再见我了
You'll never see me again when you meet her

377
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:16,149
我不想你离开我
I don't want you to leave me

378
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:32,567
有人动过这个棺村吗？
Did someone move this coffin?

379
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:33,974
没有
No

380
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:41,581
铁恨，我一定送你回家好好安葬
Tie Hen, I'll give you a proper burial

381
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:43,244
不要在这里作怪吓唬人
Stop scaring people here

382
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:45,049
你在跟谁说话
Who are you talking to?

383
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,888
刚才是你在说话吗
Did you say something just now?

384
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,586
不错，是我
That's right, it's me

385
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,990
把棺村打开
Open the coffin

386
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:57,226
棺村里面是个死人，有什么好看的
What for? There's just a corpse inside

387
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,030
棺村里除了死人之外
Apart from a dead person,

388
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:01,696
逃犯、土匪、私货、赃物
fugitives, bandits, smuggled goods, booties...

389
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:03,831
全都可以装进去的
All of that could be stored there

390
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:05,306
不过…
But...

391
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:06,671
不过什么？
But what?

392
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:09,371
开棺之后如果要有什么意外…
If anything should happen after opening the coffin...

393
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,243
有什么意外？
What could happen?

394
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,476
这个人活着的时候很凶
This person used to be very fierce

395
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:17,020
死了以后变成厉鬼
he could become an evil spirit after death

396
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:20,921
厉鬼作祟，什么事他都做得出来的
He could do anything

397
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,822
见鬼，开棺搜
Bullshit, open the coffin

398
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:23,859
是
Yes

399
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:51,280
这个人究竟是死的还是活的？
Is he dead or alive?

400
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,084
你不会自己模模
Feel him for yourself

401
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,686
你醒一醒，醒醒，血奴
Xue Nu, wake up

402
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,418
你有没有看到我棺村里的朋友？
Did you see my friend inside the coffin?

403
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:05,927
棺村里的朋友，怎么了？
What about him?

404
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,361
他不见了
He's gone

405
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:17,232
你看看，脚印…
Look, the footprints...

406
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:53,333
有血
Blood

407
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:21,466
"Peace Inn"

408
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:55,697
他们两个虽不如你的经验老到
Although they are not as experienced as you

409
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:58,366
也是你们这行中的高手
they are still considered experts even amongst you

410
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:02,775
无论发现了什么最好不要对我隐瞒
You'd better not hide anything from me

411
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,110
也不要给我铁恨那种报告
Don't give me reports like those of Tie Hen's

412
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:23,960
滚开，我这里还要做生意
Get lost, I'm doing business here

413
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:26,628
你们给我滚，滚
Get lost

414
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:30,935
我不许你们这样做，滚
I won't allow this, get lost

415
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:37,237
你以后根本不必再做生意了
You cannot do business then

416
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:41,341
我做鬼也不会放过你的
Not letting you off easily even when I become a ghost

417
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:44,285
世上如果真有厉鬼报仇
If there were ghosts

418
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:46,856
我最少已死了一千次
I would have died a thousand times

419
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,754
绝不会活到今天
and wouldn't have survived till now

420
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,681
死因找到了没有
Have you found out the cause of his death?

421
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:16,446
中毒而死的
He was poisoned

422
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,648
毒药还是暗器？
Poison or secret weapon?

423
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:20,155
还不知道
Don't know yet

424
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:25,554
心脏剖开了没有？
Cut up his heart yet?

425
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:26,721
心脏也要剖验？
His heart too?

426
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,229
要，一定要
Of course

427
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,492
是
Yes

428
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,476
萧老头
Master Xiao

429
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:43,740
我看你也是验不出什么结果了
I don't think you'd be able to find out anything

430
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:49,248
膝盖下有几根很小的针
There're some tiny needles in the knees

431
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:53,055
萧老头
Master Xiao

432
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:59,662
针是十心堂精制，毒是千机毒
The needles and poison have been made to be deadly

433
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:02,323
这种毒针就是七星夺命针
This is a Seven Stars Lethal Needle

434
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:04,264
大人慧眼明察
You're right, sir

435
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:16,409
红石击中的痕迹与针口部位相同
The wound from the rock is the same as the needle's

436
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,712
看来毒针是镶在红石上的
It seems likely that the needle came with the rock

437
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:23,445
是
Yes

438
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,318
大人，心脏里找到毒针
A poisonous needle is found in the heart

439
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:27,219
拿过来
Bring it over

440
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:28,416
是
Yes

441
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:39,167
你很聪明
You're clever

442
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:40,736
当我下令剖开心脏
Guess you knew when I ordered the heart to be cut open

443
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:42,999
迟早会发现七星夺命针的存在
that I'd find out about The Needle sooner or later;

444
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:46,042
你才肯说出针口这种事
And hence you had no choice but to confess

445
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:50,769
可惜你不够狡猾
But you're not sly enough

446
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:53,372
否则你应该知道
or you would have known that

447
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:56,578
我是在试探你真正的工作能力
I was testing your ability

448
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:02,959
铁恨是怎样死的
How did Tie Hen die?

449
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:03,526
中毒
He was poisoned

450
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:04,423
什么毒
What poison?

451
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:05,586
不清楚
Don't know

452
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:07,254
你的验尸报告我已看过
I've read your report on the autopsy

453
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:08,991
我知道
I know

454
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:15,096
有一件事我想你是否知道
There's something which you should know

455
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:19,642
郭简的尸体我已重新剖验
I've re-examined Guo Kan's body

456
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:23,076
郭简的死因跟他们都一样
Guo Kan died of the same cause as they did

457
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:26,642
可是在郭简的身上
But why couldn't you find The Needle

458
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:29,275
你为什么找不出七星夺命针
in Guo Kan's body

459
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:32,150
铁恨他有没有死？
Is Tie Hen dead?

460
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:34,349
铁恨跟你到底想隐瞒些什么
What are Tie Hen and you hiding from me?

461
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:37,723
你们是不是鹦鹉？血鹦鹉，说
Are you the Bloody Parrot? Speak

462
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:42,293
你应该知道
You should know

463
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:46,062
我的手下都是用刑的好手
my men are all good at inflicting torture

464
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:49,930
你也应该知道
You should also know

465
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,669
像我这把年纪还能活多久
that a man of my age won't live long

466
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:58,744
只怕你想死也没那么容易
I'm afraid you won't die so easily

467
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:03,380
你还没有权力控制一个人的生死
You haven't had the power to control one's life yet

468
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:17,400
我不想你死，你就绝对不能死
You can't die if I wish it to be otherwise

469
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:32,475
铁恨的棺木在哪里？
Where's Tie Hen's coffin?

470
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:35,245
这个，在鹦鹉楼
At the Parrot Brothel

471
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,284
听说铁恨的尸体
It's been rumoured that Tie Hen

472
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:38,149
昨晚变了僵尸，失了踪
has become a vampire last night and disappeared

473
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:39,449
失踪？
Disappeared?

474
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:42,116
张铁，林平，你们两个留下
Zhang Tie, Lin Ping, you two stay behind

475
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:43,454
是
Yes

476
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:45,426
带路去鹦鹉楼
Show me the way to the Parrot Brothel

477
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:56,605
你就是血奴？
So you are Xue Nu?

478
00:47:57,674 --> 00:48:00,541
你为什么不把那副棺村搬出去
Why didn't you move that coffin out?

479
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:03,575
这不是我的东西
This is not mine

480
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,648
是叶霆风不肯搬？
Was it Ye Ting Feng who didn't want to move it?

481
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:09,185
我没问他，今天我还没有见到他
Didn't ask him... I haven't seen him yet today

482
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:13,086
听他说他去找那个变了僵尸的朋友
I hear he's gone to look for his vampire friend

483
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:17,458
说不定他现在已被僵尸指住喉咙
Maybe he's been killed by the vampire

484
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,461
再也回不来了
and won't come back

485
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:28,602
晚忠 在
- Wan Zhong - Yes

486
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:29,399
检查棺村
Check the coffin

487
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:30,700
是
Yes

488
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:32,069
韩老大在
- Master Hon - Yes

489
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:34,109
你与安子豪去剖验那两个公差
You & An Zi Hao go check the two officers' bodies

490
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:35,303
尽快把报告送来
and bring me the report immediately

491
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,504
是
Yes

492
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:44,480
大人，棺村打开过两次
My lord, the coffin has been opened twice

493
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,488
第二次打开后没钉上
it wasn't nailed secure since then

494
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,249
把它打开
Open it

495
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:48,415
是
Yes

496
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:21,318
你就是叶霆风
Are you Ye Ting Feng?

497
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:22,892
是的
Yes

498
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:26,721
你知不知道棺村是用来装死人的
Don't you know a coffin is used to carry someone dead?

499
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:27,762
我知道
I do

500
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:29,661
那你为什么要睡进去
Then why are you sleeping in there?

501
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:32,132
我不想这么快就变成死人
I don't want to become a dead man so quickly

502
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:34,726
啊？有人要杀你？
Oh? Someone wants to kill you?

503
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:38,205
是的，这里所有人都想杀我
Yes, everyone here is after my life

504
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:41,143
睡在棺村里也不一定安全
It may not be absolutely safe to sleep in a coffin

505
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:44,475
很容易被人活活钉死的
You may actually suffocate & die in there

506
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:46,378
好在这副棺村出过僵尸
It's lucky that a vampire has been here

507
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:47,711
没有人敢接近它
so nobody dares to come close

508
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:48,580
僵尸？
Vampire?

509
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:49,549
大人
My lord,

510
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:52,486
在死了公差的断臂中
a Seven Stars Lethal Needle was found

511
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:55,023
剖出了一枚七星夺命针
in the amputated arm of the dead officer

512
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:01,261
七星夺命针？
The Seven Stars Lethal Needle?

513
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:07,599
你肯定铁恨死了？
Are you sure Tie Hen is dead?

514
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:11,333
一个人的死活我还分得出来
I can tell the difference between a living & a dead man

515
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,843
死人居然还会放毒针杀人？
A dead man using poisonous needle to kill?

516
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:18,972
你不如去问那个死人好了
You'd better go and ask that dead man

517
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:43,296
这幅魔画有时有鬼眼出现
Demon eyes sometimes appear in the picture

518
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:45,869
所以你把它涂了？
So you covered it up?

519
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:47,273
是的
Yes

520
00:50:48,278 --> 00:50:49,802
卜鬲壁是谁住的？
Who's living next door?

521
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:53,679
采妈妈住的，是一个巫婆
Madam Song, she's a witch

522
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:55,115
巫婆
Witch?

523
00:50:57,254 --> 00:51:03,955
僵尸？魔画？鬼眼
Vampire? A demonic drawing? Ghost eye?

524
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:08,688
走，去找那个巫婆
Go, go and find that witch

525
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:09,731
是
Yes

526
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:23,037
笨蛋
Idiot

527
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:22,532
什么人
Who is it?

528
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,997
果然是她在偷窥
She's peeping

529
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:34,236
你看她拜的是五毒鬼佛
See, she worships devilish idols

530
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:36,835
看来一定是用毒的能手
She must be an expert in using poison

531
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:44,478
怪不得那些秽物恶臭到令人昏眩
No wonder those things stink

532
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:53,587
小心你的手下不要乱碰这里的东西
Ask your men not to touch anything

533
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:54,789
可能有毒
There could be poison stains

534
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:57,559
不要打开
Don't open it

535
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,542
唐老大，解药
Master Tong, antidote

536
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:49,475
住手，不要打了
Stop, stop fighting

537
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:52,180
你疯了？
Are you crazy?

538
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:01,809
僵尸
Vampire

539
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:04,743
尹平…
Wan Ping...

540
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,991
"lmperial Guard"

541
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:21,918
全到了没有？
All here?

542
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:24,255
全都到齐了，三爷
All here, Master San

543
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:28,456
在这里，这里是一千两
Here's a thousand taels of silver

544
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,499
三爷，要我们弟兄来做什么事
What can we do for you?

545
00:59:34,604 --> 00:59:37,437
要你们去抓一个人
To go and catch someone

546
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:39,167
谁？
Who is it?

547
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,100
血奴
Xue Nu

548
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:43,075
这很容易，三爷放心，走
That's easy, Master San, don't worry, go

549
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:47,172
等一等，血奴身边有个贴身的丫环
Wait, Xue Nu has a personal maid

550
00:59:47,283 --> 00:59:51,219
她名字叫红玉，她擅用绣花针杀人
Her name is Hong Yu & her embroidery needle is lethal

551
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:54,188
你们见了她千万要小心
Be careful of her

552
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:55,757
最好是避开她
Better avoid seeing her

553
00:59:55,858 --> 00:59:56,347
知道了
Understood

554
00:59:56,459 --> 00:59:56,948
走吧
Go

555
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:58,118
走
Go

556
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:28,414
上当了
Tricked

557
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:30,392
上
Go

558
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:46,567
快走
Hurry and go

559
01:01:05,361 --> 01:01:06,385
小心
Be careful

560
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:26,473
你们七个人的面皮
The skin from the seven of you

561
01:01:26,582 --> 01:01:28,777
刚好够我做一条裙子
is just enough for me to make a skirt

562
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:29,977
上
Attack

563
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:40,322
你是红玉
You are Hong Yu

564
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:10,586
布阵
Set the formation

565
01:02:13,996 --> 01:02:15,190
可惜你这个阵
Too bad your formation

566
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:17,095
顾得上面，顾不了下面
can't cover you from all sides

567
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,327
顾得前面，顾不了后面
There're some weak points

568
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:25,558
你几时学会把人绣成瞎子
Since when have you learnt to turn someone blind?

569
01:03:25,668 --> 01:03:26,965
三十年前
Thirty years ago

570
01:03:27,904 --> 01:03:30,702
原来你就是江湖上号称娃娃脸的
So you are the famous Doll Face

571
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:33,139
夺命神针红玉姑娘
Killer Needle Lady Hong Yu

572
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:34,368
把血奴交给我
Hand Xue Nu over to me

573
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,445
她在我身边会安全得多
She's safer with me

574
01:03:36,546 --> 01:03:38,537
你到鹦鹉楼来干什么
What are you doing here at the Parrot Brothel?

575
01:03:38,915 --> 01:03:41,679
她是我娘派来保护我的
She's been sent by my mother to protect me

576
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:00,668
把尸体搬走
Move the corpse away

577
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:58,326
你应该知道这个女人是我的
You should know that this woman is mine

578
01:04:58,427 --> 01:04:59,394
我知道
I know

579
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:01,656
你为什么要把她带走
Why are you taking her away?

580
01:05:01,764 --> 01:05:04,198
我只是想证明一件事
I just want to prove one thing

581
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:05,426
什么事
What is that?

582
01:05:05,868 --> 01:05:08,393
滇王府的一件丑事
A scandal at the residence of the Prince of Dian

583
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:12,165
那跟血奴有什么关系
What has it to do with Xue Nu?

584
01:05:12,275 --> 01:05:14,539
血奴不是李大娘的女儿
Xue Nu isn't the daughter of Madam Li

585
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:16,612
她是滇王妃的私生女
She's the illegitimate daughter of the Princess of Dian

586
01:05:16,712 --> 01:05:18,509
也是滇王府唯一生存的人
and the only survivor in the family of the Prince Dian

587
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:19,581
你凭什么这样说
What makes you say that?

588
01:05:19,682 --> 01:05:22,810
二十年前我在滇王府工职画师
20 years ago, I was a painter at the Prince residence

589
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:24,011
官职虽小
Although I was a humble officer then

590
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,611
但有机会进入王府接近王爷
I had the chance to get close to the Prince

591
01:05:26,722 --> 01:05:29,122
有一天奉召进王府
One day, I was summoned

592
01:05:29,792 --> 01:05:33,284
郭总管，像已经画好了，请过目
Chief Guo, the painting is finished, please have a look

593
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:39,057
你等一等，请
Wait, please

594
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:51,380
红蝙蝠原产拢洲
The red bats originated from Long Zhou

595
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:55,314
垫伏红蕉花洞，性淫
resided at the Cave, and were licentious

596
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:59,354
这个血石是用十万只红蝙蝠的血
This blood rock was made from the blood of

597
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:01,582
凝结提炼而成
a hundred thousand red bats

598
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:04,592
服食以后，不但长生不老
Once taken, not only could one live forever

599
01:06:04,694 --> 01:06:07,322
还可以壮阳固精
one could be sexually potent

600
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:12,030
王爷淫虐成性，早有所闻
The Prince is known for his lasciviousness

601
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:16,298
岂知他还有一种丑恶的性变态
He is also perverse in a certain way

602
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:18,202
就非我所了解
which I do not understand

603
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:22,711
这就是我一直想不透
I've been trying in vain to figure this out

604
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:28,306
一年后，王妃产下一个婴儿
A year later the Princess gave birth to a baby

605
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:31,784
是男是女，没有人知道
No one knew whether it was a boy or a girl

606
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:34,219
因为出生的当天
because on the day the baby was born

607
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:36,985
婴孩就被人抱出宫外
someone took the child away

608
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:41,195
王妃临别解下一块佩玉
But before that, the Princess hung

609
01:06:41,297 --> 01:06:43,356
挂｝在婴儿的身上
a piece ofjade on the baby's body

610
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:45,263
从此以后
And from then onwards

611
01:06:45,368 --> 01:06:49,031
宫中不见有人提起这个婴孩
no one in the palace ever mentioned about that baby

612
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,065
奇怪的是血奴身上那块佩玉
It's weird that Xue Nu has got that piece ofjade;

613
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:55,666
就是王妃当年留下的信物
the same piece which the Princess left behind

614
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:59,204
其实你不应该把这件事告诉我
You shouldn't have told me that

615
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:02,478
对，或许我不应该在这儿告诉你
That's right, maybe I shouldn't have

616
01:07:11,627 --> 01:07:12,355
是你
It's you

617
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:13,723
你说的太多了
You talk too much

618
01:07:37,686 --> 01:07:39,119
你怎么把她杀了
Why did you kill her?

619
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:44,286
这种人死了喂狗，狗都嫌臭
Death is too good for her

620
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:45,587
有什么可惜的
what's to be ashamed of?

621
01:07:45,694 --> 01:07:48,492
可是我们少了一条线索
Unfortunately we've got one lead less

622
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,194
第一次见面就这么不客气
You're so unfriendly the first time we meet

623
01:08:20,296 --> 01:08:22,457
想见你实在不容易
It's not that easy to meet you

624
01:08:22,565 --> 01:08:24,123
你有什么事
What do you want?

625
01:08:25,835 --> 01:08:28,702
你大概很熟悉这件东西吧
You might be familiar with this thing

626
01:08:30,172 --> 01:08:32,140
这是血奴身上的佩玉
It's Xue Nu's jade; also a token

627
01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:35,540
也是滇王妃给她私生女的信物
from the Princess to her illegitimate daughter

628
01:08:37,246 --> 01:08:38,804
什么意思
What do you mean?

629
01:08:38,914 --> 01:08:41,508
我还想知道你到底是什么人
I want to know who you are

630
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:44,347
即使你知道了又怎么样
What if you knew?

631
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,751
我还想娶你
I still want to marry you

632
01:08:49,558 --> 01:08:53,654
你杀了这么多人就是为了这件事
You've killed so many people just for this

633
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:57,324
有一件事你还不太清楚
There's one thing which you still don't know yet

634
01:08:57,433 --> 01:09:00,163
在我眼里你虽然很迷人
Undeniably I find you very attractive

635
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:03,568
但是跟滇王府的珠宝比起来
But as compared to the treasures of the Prince of Dian

636
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:06,072
那批珠宝会更可爱
they are more attractive

637
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:10,574
有件事你也不太清楚
There's one thing which you still don't know yet

638
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:13,544
我既不知道什么珠宝
I don't know what treasures you are talking about

639
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:16,413
也跟滇王府没有丝毫的关系
and I have nothing to do with the Prince of Dian

640
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:20,679
不要把门关得太早
Don't close your back door too early

641
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:22,757
你女儿还在我的手里
Your daughter is still in my hands

642
01:09:23,726 --> 01:09:25,717
你是要滇王府的珠宝呢
Do you want to keep the treasures

643
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:27,295
还是要你的女儿
or your daughter?

644
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:40,775
这支毒镖三个时辰内就能致人死命
This poisonous dart will kill people in about six hours

645
01:09:40,876 --> 01:09:43,208
这个人质帮不了你
This hostage of yours won't help you much

646
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:44,810
好狠毒的女人
What a vicious woman you are!

647
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:37,959
血奴
Xue Nu

648
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:40,119
想不到我娘这么狠毒
I don't believe that my mother is so vicious

649
01:16:22,177 --> 01:16:24,407
啊，珠宝
Treasures

650
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,944
那不是王府失窃的珠宝吗
Aren't they the lost treasures of the Prince residence?

651
01:16:30,018 --> 01:16:31,007
走
Go

652
01:17:08,724 --> 01:17:10,055
那里有通路
There's a way over there

653
01:18:43,318 --> 01:18:46,446
血奴…
Xue Nu

654
01:24:57,725 --> 01:25:00,216
原来在江湖上兴妖作怪的血鹦鹉
So you are the Bloody Parrot

655
01:25:00,328 --> 01:25:02,592
就是你这条老蛔虫
who has been causing a lot of trouble

656
01:25:03,631 --> 01:25:06,065
其实根本没有什么血鹦鹉
In reality, there's no such thing as the Bloody Parrot

657
01:25:06,167 --> 01:25:08,897
那只是一盏会发光的灯
It's only an illuminated lamp

658
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,239
你们到底在搞什么花样？
What tricks are you playing?

659
01:25:13,341 --> 01:25:15,138
也许你就是赔了这条命
Maybe you would never know

660
01:25:15,243 --> 01:25:17,040
也不会弄清楚
even if you lost your life

661
01:26:32,654 --> 01:26:34,315
好死不如赖活着
In all respects it's to be alive than dead

662
01:26:34,422 --> 01:26:37,186
你偏偏找这个地方来送死
You are digging your own grave

663
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:53,172
你是…
You are...

664
01:27:03,685 --> 01:27:05,550
当我踏足江湖时
When I got involved in the martial arts world

665
01:27:05,653 --> 01:27:07,917
早就把生死置之度外
I no longer had any regard for my own life

666
01:27:08,022 --> 01:27:11,583
可是我不明白，血奴跟你什么关系
But I still don't get it what Xue Nu has to do with you

667
01:27:11,693 --> 01:27:13,558
血鹦鹉到底是怎么回事
What's the Bloody Parrot all about?

668
01:27:13,661 --> 01:27:16,391
江湖上不怕死的人不多
There aren't many people who are not afraid of death

669
01:27:16,497 --> 01:27:19,955
今天我叫你死个明明白白
I'll give you a good reason to die today

670
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:24,362
你就是…
So you are...

671
01:27:24,472 --> 01:27:26,064
我就是滇王府的王妃
I am the Princess of Dian

672
01:27:26,174 --> 01:27:28,972
他就是滇王府的总管郭繁
He's Chief Guo Fan

673
01:27:29,077 --> 01:27:30,339
原来你们都还活着
So you are still alive

674
01:27:30,445 --> 01:27:32,276
我们本来都没有死
We have not been dead

675
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:34,712
只是利用血鹦鹉的传说
We've been using the rumours about the Bloody Parrot

676
01:27:34,816 --> 01:27:36,807
我们伪造了一个
to make up a story

677
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:38,886
王府珠宝失踪的故事
about the lost treasure

678
01:27:38,987 --> 01:27:40,887
其实谁也没有见过血鹦鹉
No one has ever seen the Bloody Parrot

679
01:27:40,989 --> 01:27:43,617
所有的事都是我们两人安排的
These have just been set up by the two of us

680
01:27:44,692 --> 01:27:47,889
这把剑装有弹簧根本杀不死人
This sword has a spring and cannot kill people

681
01:27:51,332 --> 01:27:52,765
原来你们这样做
You did this

682
01:27:52,867 --> 01:27:53,891
就是为了吞占这批
just to grab all for yourselves

683
01:27:54,002 --> 01:27:55,936
要朝贡当今天子的珠宝
these treasures meant as tribute to the Emperor

684
01:27:56,037 --> 01:27:59,529
你说吞占也好、冒犯朝廷也好
You can put it in whatever way you like

685
01:27:59,641 --> 01:28:03,407
只是我太喜爱这批珠宝了
I just love these treasures so much

686
01:28:03,845 --> 01:28:08,805
可惜你们白白的送掉了王爷的性命
But you've made the Prince lose his life for nothing

687
01:28:10,885 --> 01:28:13,115
人总是要死的
Death comes to us all

688
01:28:13,221 --> 01:28:17,214
况且他只是一个荒淫无能的老人
Besides, he was a licentious old man

689
01:28:17,325 --> 01:28:20,351
天下最毒女人心，果然如此
No wonder it's said that women are vicious

690
01:28:20,461 --> 01:28:22,929
无毒不丈失，那又怎么说
It's also said men are vicious

691
01:28:23,031 --> 01:28:25,625
你以为可以安享这批珠宝了吗？
Can you be at peace with these treasures?

692
01:28:26,868 --> 01:28:28,426
天下两大名捕
The two famous constables

693
01:28:28,536 --> 01:28:31,596
常笑，铁恨都已经死了
Chang Xiao and Tie Hen are dead

694
01:28:31,706 --> 01:28:33,196
那我还担心什么？
What have I got to worry about?

695
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:36,300
铁手无情铁恨他并没有死
Tie Hen is not dead

696
01:28:39,814 --> 01:28:43,147
你应该知道他早就变成僵尸了
You should know that he's turned into a vampire

697
01:28:43,251 --> 01:28:45,378
你以为僵尸可怕吗？
Do you think a vampire is terrifying?

698
01:28:45,486 --> 01:28:47,852
僵尸并不可怕
No

699
01:28:48,289 --> 01:28:51,452
可怕的是你并没有把我杀死
The most terrible thing is you failed to kill me

700
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:09,643
这块所谓夺人魂魄的血石
This so-called blood rock supposed to suck one's soul

701
01:29:09,744 --> 01:29:12,269
只不过是一件藏有毒针的暗器
is a secret weapon with poisonous needles

702
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:15,247
对我来说早已不起作用
I am immune to it

703
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:19,077
当鹦鹉楼出现僵尸的时候
When a vampire appeared at the Parrot Brothel

704
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:20,586
我早就应该想到
I should have known that

705
01:29:20,688 --> 01:29:22,315
你是用窒息功来装死
you faked your death

706
01:29:22,423 --> 01:29:26,359
可惜你的脑子一向不够敏捷
But you are not smart enough

707
01:29:48,015 --> 01:29:52,611
只要你放出我的朋友，跟我归案
Had you released my friend and gone back with me

708
01:29:53,254 --> 01:29:56,087
也许可以保全你们的性命
you might have saved your own life

709
01:31:36,457 --> 01:31:40,257
谢谢我…
Thanks to me...

710
01:31:44,232 --> 01:31:45,426
难道是你救了我？
Did you save me?

711
01:31:45,533 --> 01:31:47,626
他只不过是一只鹦鹉
