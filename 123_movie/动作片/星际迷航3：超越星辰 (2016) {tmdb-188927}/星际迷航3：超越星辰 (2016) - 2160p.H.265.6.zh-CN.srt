1
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,932
我是詹姆斯 提比略 柯克船长
My name is Captain James Tiberius Kirk.

2
00:01:26,026 --> 00:01:27,807
来自星际联盟
United Federation of Planets

3
00:01:28,423 --> 00:01:31,425
本次我作为一名中立代表
I came here before you as a neutral representative

4
00:01:31,862 --> 00:01:33,458
代表佛博南共和国前来觐见
of the Fabonane Republic.

5
00:01:34,193 --> 00:01:35,807
向你们致以诚挚的问候
And bring you a message of good will

6
00:01:36,327 --> 00:01:39,353
并向您，尊敬的提纳兹代表团的各位
And present to you, esteemed members of the teenaxiene delegation

7
00:01:39,845 --> 00:01:44,621
呈上这份来自佛博南最高议会充满诚意的礼物
A gift from Fabonan High Council with the highest regard.

8
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:48,941
他脑子有毛病吧？
What's wrong with it?

9
00:01:50,391 --> 00:01:52,837
- 您说什么？  - 他们为什么不要那玩意了？
- Excuse me?  - Why the don't they want it anymore?

10
00:01:53,471 --> 00:01:56,635
这是某种上古武器的一块碎片
Well... This was once a piece of an ancient weapon

11
00:01:56,846 --> 00:01:59,251
现在他们把它献给你们作为一种
And now they offer it as a symbol, of...

12
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:00,853
和平的象征
... of peace.

13
00:02:01,384 --> 00:02:03,685
在佛博南的传统中主动奉上武器就意味着
In the Fabonan culture this surrendal weapon

14
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,781
请求休战
is an offer of truth.

15
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:06,024
那他们是怎么找到它的？
How they got it?

16
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:08,827
他们说这是他们很久以前得到的
They told me, they acquired it long time ago.

17
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,233
那这就是他们偷来的！
So they stole it, then!

18
00:02:11,395 --> 00:02:12,788
不，他们...
No... the uhm...

19
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:13,613
其实
Well...

20
00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:16,965
你们根本不像我们一样了解佛博南人
You don't know the Fabonan like we do !

21
00:02:17,028 --> 00:02:19,488
您说的对，殿下，这份礼物...
That's very true.Your excellency, this gift...

22
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:22,214
他们是一群卑劣的小偷
They are crowds of untrustworthy thieves.

23
00:02:22,268 --> 00:02:24,845
想看着我们被杀死在自家的床上
who wants to see us murdered in our own base.

24
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:28,919
这件无价之宝寄托了他们的信任和对和平的渴望
This beloved artifact is a symbol of trust and peace.

25
00:02:28,944 --> 00:02:33,024
他们会把我们剁成碎块，再把我们放火上烤
They will cut us into pieces,and roast us over a fire...

26
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:34,034
我不认为那是真的...
I don't think that's true...

27
00:02:34,059 --> 00:02:35,516
最后吃掉我们！
... and eat us !!

28
00:02:38,037 --> 00:02:38,709
您说什么？
What ?!

29
00:03:02,025 --> 00:03:04,091
斯科特，快把我弄出去！
Scotty!! Get me out of here!

30
00:03:04,305 --> 00:03:05,403
<i>这么快就好了！</i>
<i>Well, that was quick.</i>

31
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,916
<i>长官，你的表面有干扰物</i>
<i>There is quite a bit a surface interference, sir.</i>

32
00:03:25,702 --> 00:03:27,375
我又把制服撕破了
I ripped my shirt again.

33
00:03:27,809 --> 00:03:28,426
谈判进展如何？
How'd it go?

34
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,238
长官，您和提纳兹人达成协议了吗？
Captain, did you manage to broke a treaty with the <i>Teenaxi</i>?

35
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,518
这么说吧，会谈没多久就结束了
Uhm... Let's just say we came out short.

36
00:03:36,543 --> 00:03:40,974
史波克，你能帮我把这个锁回柜子里吗，谢谢
You look... move that back into the personal vault, Spock.Thank you.

37
00:03:41,517 --> 00:03:44,137
- 吉姆，你看上去糟透了  - 谢谢夸奖，老骨头
- Jim, you look like crap.  - Thank you, Bones.

38
00:03:44,222 --> 00:03:46,877
你太阳穴位置的静脉又明显凸起，你没事吧
You have a little vein popin out of your tremble again. You okay?

39
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:49,703
我很好，今天只不过又是星际舰队里无聊的一天罢了
Never better.It's just a another day in fleet.

40
00:03:57,751 --> 00:04:01,060
<i> 航行日志, 星历2263.2.</i>
<i>Captain's Log, Stardate 2263.2</i>

41
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:07,883
<i>今天是我们在外太空航行的第966天</i>
<i>Today is our 966-day in deep space.</i>

42
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:10,606
<i>我们已经度过了五年任务中的三年</i>
<i>A little over 3 years of our 5 year mission.</i>

43
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,419
<i>我们呆在这的时间越长，我们就愈发感到</i>
<i>More time you spend out here, the harder it is</i>

44
00:04:16,444 --> 00:04:20,571
<i>当一天结束之时，迎接新的一天的艰难</i>
<i>to tell when one day ends and the next one begins.</i>

45
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,492
<i>要在这要找到归属感极为困难</i>
<i>It can be a challenge to feel grounded</i>

46
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,915
<i>因为连重力本身都是人造的</i>
<i>when even gravity is artifical.</i>

47
00:04:30,384 --> 00:04:32,980
<i>但我们会尽我们所能把这里变得像家一样</i>
<i>But while we do what we can to make it feel like home</i>

48
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,478
<i>船员们总是表现得极为完美</i>
<i>The crew is always continues to act admirably</i>

49

<i>despite the rigors of our extended stay here in outer space</i>

<i>同时他们也做出了许多牺牲</i>
<i>and the personal sacrifices they have made.</i>

51
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:50,898
<i>我们在持续找寻新的生命形式</i>
<i>We continue to search for new forms in order</i>

52
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:53,365
<i>并且建立起彼此之间牢固的外交关系</i>
<i>to establish firm diplomatic ties.</i>

53
00:04:54,553 --> 00:04:56,139
<i>我们不断地探索未知领域</i>

<i>考验飞船的机械性能</i>

<i>...is more than up for the job.</i>

57
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:08,788
<i>除此之外，飞船上长期的同居生活</i>
<i>The ship aside, prolonged cohabitation has...</i>

58
00:05:09,178 --> 00:05:11,951
<i>确实对我们之间的一些人际关系产生了影响</i>

<i>有一些如胶似漆</i>

<i>有一些则不太妙</i>

<i>至于我自己，我越来越觉得自己变得有些</i>

<i>有些多虑</i>

<i>随着我们对宇宙的不断探索，我开始思考这样一个问题</i>
<i>Futher out we go, the more I find myself wondering</i>

64
00:05:33,571 --> 00:05:35,279
<i>我们究竟想要的是什么</i>
<i>what is it we are trying to accomplish.</i>

65
00:05:36,276 --> 00:05:38,746
<i>如果宇宙真的是无穷无尽的</i>
<i>If the universe is trully endless, then...</i>

66
00:05:39,471 --> 00:05:42,502
<i>那我们努力去到达的正是我们无法抵达的地方</i>
<i>...if we're not striving for something forever out of reach.</i>

67
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:47,442
<i>进取号正在取得在约克城停靠的许可</i>
<i>The Enterprise is scheduled for repremission to stop at Yorktown,</i>

68
00:05:48,063 --> 00:05:50,461
<i>那是星际联邦最新最先进的星舰基地</i>
<i>Federation's newest and most advanced starbase.</i>

69
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:54,553
<i>也许这个小小的休假能让我们从</i>

70
00:05:54,578 --> 00:05:57,222

<i>...not from mysteries, the unknown.</i>

71
00:06:13,297 --> 00:06:14,288
抱歉，我迟到了
Sorry, I'm late.

72
00:06:14,701 --> 00:06:17,603
昆赛尔正在呼出某种绿色的酸性卤素液体
Keenser's weakend by some hallious seed green flu...

73
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:20,096
斯科特吓坏了，怕他一个喷嚏打在飞船的主核心上
...and Scotty is terrified, he's gonna sneeze on warp core

74
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:21,120
我们就都完了
and kill us all.

75
00:06:22,338 --> 00:06:23,459
你他丫的在喝什么？
What the hell are you drink?

76
00:06:25,154 --> 00:06:28,092
我很确定这是我们从赛塔斯带回来剩下的索里安白兰地
Pretty sure it's the rest of that Saurian brandy we picked up on Thasus.

77
00:06:28,544 --> 00:06:30,794
天哪！你这是要把自己喝瞎吗？
My god man! Are you trying to go blind?

78
00:06:31,222 --> 00:06:32,318
这东西可是违法的
That stuff's illegal.

79
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:37,571
不过，我在契科夫的柜子里发现了这个
Besides, I found this in Chekov's locker.

80
00:06:38,746 --> 00:06:39,235
哇
Wow!

81
00:06:39,268 --> 00:06:41,679
好极了，我一直在想，他可是喝伏特加的
Right, I mean I always assumed he would be Vodka guy...

82
00:06:41,704 --> 00:06:43,491
没错，伏特加
Vodka guy. Exactly.

83
00:06:43,609 --> 00:06:46,057
我一直想为你生日准备一些像样的东西
I wanted to have something appropriate for your birthday.

84
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:49,427
还有还多天呢，你不必着急
It's a couple of days, you know I don't care about that.

85
00:06:49,712 --> 00:06:52,501
我明白，你不喜欢庆祝自己的生日
I know. You don't like celebrating it to on the day...

86
00:06:52,526 --> 00:06:54,776
因为那天正好也是你父亲的忌日
...because it's also the day your pop bit the dust.

87
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:55,990
我能理解你的心情
I was being sensitive.

88
00:06:56,377 --> 00:06:59,362
你在上医学院的时候就从没人教过你怎么好好说话吗？
Did they teach you about better manner at medical school?

89
00:07:00,737 --> 00:07:02,345
又或者说这只是你南方人的特色？
Or it's just a sudden charm?

90
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,826
- 这酒好极了  - 可不是么
- Oh yeah. Ooh. That's good.  - Lordy.

91
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:20,534
你要给你的母亲打给电话么
You're gonna call your mom?

92
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,662
当然，到了那天我肯定会打的
Yeah, of course I'll call on the day.

93
00:07:26,827 --> 00:07:28,290
我又老了一岁
I'm an year older.

94
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:31,610
是啊，生日不就这意思么
Yeah, that's usually how it works.

95
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,398
比他原来的年龄又多了一岁
A year older than he ever got to be.

96
00:07:38,714 --> 00:07:40,146
他加入了星际舰队，因为
He joined the Starfleet because he...

97
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:42,884
他有信念
...he believed in it.

98
00:07:45,985 --> 00:07:47,120
我来这不过是一时上头罢了
I joined on a dare.

99
00:07:48,392 --> 00:07:50,474
你来这是为了不辜负他的期望
You joined this if you can live up to him.

100
00:07:51,963 --> 00:07:55,871
你花了这么多时间向你的父亲乔治 科克看齐
It's been all this time, you are trying to be George Kirk...

101
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,987
到头来你却在想为什么活不出自己的特色
...and now you're wondering just what it means to be Jim...

102
00:07:59,737 --> 00:08:01,330
在想自己为什么进入星际舰队
...why you're out here.

103
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:07,334
敬完美的你，至少你还有一头黑发
To prove that aside and a full head of hair.

104
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,829
- 我是柯克  - 船长
- Kirk here. - Captain.

105
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:18,436
- 正在接近约克城基地  - 我马上过去，苏鲁先生
- Approaching Yorktown base.  - I'm on my way, Mr. Sulu.

106
00:08:19,945 --> 00:08:22,282
生日的事请为我保密
Let's keep this birthday thing in a wraps something.

107
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:25,558
明白，敏感先生
You know me.Mr. Sensitive.

108
00:08:29,298 --> 00:08:32,250
真是壮观极了
Woaah, that is impressive.

109
00:08:32,915 --> 00:08:35,043
没错，她是个大美人，对吧
Ay. She is a beauty, isn't she?

110
00:08:35,372 --> 00:08:37,769
真是个畸形的怪物
What a damn monstrosity.

111
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,926
我们能在这个星球上租几块地吗
Can't we just wrap some space on a planet?

112
00:08:39,927 --> 00:08:42,990
在星联星球间表露出地域偏好
Sharing geographical favouritism among conducted Federation worlds

113
00:08:43,015 --> 00:08:44,717
可能会导致外交紧张
could cause diplomatic tension.

114
00:08:44,755 --> 00:08:46,318
你不认为它看上去都挤在一起了么
Oh, you don't think that looks tense?

115
00:08:46,347 --> 00:08:49,670
它只是太空中一个混蛋的大雪球，等着我们去打碎而已
Looks like a damn snow globe in space just waiting to break.

116
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:52,815
那它就消失了，老骨头
Ah, that's the spirit, Bones!

117
00:10:16,145 --> 00:10:17,152
史波克！
Spock!

118
00:10:18,971 --> 00:10:20,450
你现在有空吗
Do you have a moment?

119
00:10:21,553 --> 00:10:22,637
当然了，尼欧塔
Of course, Nyota.

120
00:10:23,502 --> 00:10:25,597
我得把这个还给你
You should have this back.

121
00:10:25,956 --> 00:10:27,447
这毕竟是你母亲的遗物
It belonged to your mother.

122
00:10:27,448 --> 00:10:29,842
我们瓦肯人从不收回
It is not in a Vulcan custom...

123
00:10:29,843 --> 00:10:33,118
已经送出去的礼物，这是传统
...to receive again that thing which was given as a gift.

124
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:45,148
你们分手了？
You guys break up?

125
00:10:46,982 --> 00:10:48,612
你做了啥错事？
What did you do?

126
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:51,273
你的推理过于简单了，医生
A typically reductive incourin out to.

127
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:56,813
听我说，史波克，如果一个地球女孩跟你说她错了，你没错
You know Spock,if an Earth girl says it's me not you.

128
00:10:57,626 --> 00:10:59,066
那绝对是你错了
It's definitely you.

129
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,728
打扰一下
Excuse me.

130
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:09,289
史波克指挥官，你现在有空么？
Commander Spock.Will you have a minute of your time?

131
00:11:33,704 --> 00:11:35,846
感谢您告知我此事
Thank you for bringing me this,into my attention.

132
00:11:37,491 --> 00:11:39,198
生生不息 繁荣昌盛
Live long and prosper.

133
00:11:39,763 --> 00:11:41,802
生生不息 繁荣昌盛
Live long and prosper.

134
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:07,744
<i>史波克大使，生于2230.06  卒于2263.02</i>
<i>Ambassador Spock，2230.06 - 2263.02</i>

135
00:12:47,037 --> 00:12:49,075
检测到一个正在靠近的飞行器
I have an alert of incoming vessel.

136
00:12:49,705 --> 00:12:51,609
身份不明，非星联飞行器
Unidentified non-federation.

137
00:12:51,873 --> 00:12:53,186
请注意，未知飞行器
Attention, unidentified vessel.

138
00:12:53,211 --> 00:12:55,162
你未获取靠近许可
You are not authorized for approach.

139
00:12:55,187 --> 00:12:57,228
关闭引擎 等待指示
Power down and wait for instruction.

140
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:02,374
未知飞行器 请回答
Unidentified vessel, please comply.

141
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:17,594
请用正常语速说话
Just speak normally.

144
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:30,863
我们在赛斯星云执行一个科学考察任务
We were on a science mission inside the nebula.

145
00:13:31,532 --> 00:13:35,260
我们的飞船出现严重故障
Our ship suffered a critical malfunction.

146
00:13:36,378 --> 00:13:37,971
我上了一个救生舱
I took an escape pod.

147
00:13:39,646 --> 00:13:42,609
我们的飞船迫降在附近的一个星球上
Before the ship crash landed on a nearby planet.

148
00:13:43,827 --> 00:13:48,630
我们需要一艘能在星云间航行的飞船
We need a ship,capable of navigating the nebula.

149
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:54,698
你必须派人来帮帮我们
You must have someone,who can help us.

150
00:13:58,163 --> 00:14:01,776
我们试图在赛斯星云定位失事飞船，那是一片未知的星域，因此没有成功
We tracked her stranded ship through the sector of uncharted nebula.

151
00:14:01,811 --> 00:14:04,294
坐标210，14
Here. 210, mark 14.

152
00:14:05,995 --> 00:14:07,433
远距扫描有结果吗？
Long-range scan?

153
00:14:07,819 --> 00:14:12,110
没有，那片未知星云过于密集了
No data. The nebula is too dense.It's uncharted space.

154
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,803
进取号的导航系统是全舰队中最先进的
Well, the Enterprise does have the best navigational systems in the fleet.

155
00:14:17,032 --> 00:14:17,830
她应该能完成这次救援任务
She can handle it.

156
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,539
唯一一艘比进取号更为先进的星舰
The only ship here,with more advanced technology...

157
00:14:20,574 --> 00:14:22,561
仍然在建设中
...is still under construction.

158
00:14:23,481 --> 00:14:26,202
我想说的是，我们要派过去的不仅仅是一艘星舰
But it's not just a ship that I am sending.

159
00:14:27,716 --> 00:14:28,974
我马上集合船员
I'll gather the crew.

160
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:30,079
船长
Captain.

161
00:14:31,027 --> 00:14:34,740
因为你目前在我管辖的星域里，星舰指挥部把你
Starfleet Command sent me your application for your vice-admiral position

162
00:14:34,775 --> 00:14:36,723
提交的中将升职申请函发给我了
here at this installation.

163
00:14:37,861 --> 00:14:38,602
我知道，女士
Yes, ma'am.

164
00:14:41,587 --> 00:14:45,248
如果允许的话，我会推荐史波克指挥官
If I may, I would recommend Commander Spock...

165
00:14:45,283 --> 00:14:47,287
接任我成为下一任进取号指挥官
to replace me as a Captain of the Enteprise.

166
00:14:47,914 --> 00:14:52,028
他是一位模范星舰军官，他会是一位好船长的
He is an exemplary Starfleet officer.He'll make a great Captain.

167
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,705
你要知道，在星际舰队中，哪怕是在职的星舰舰长
It isn't uncommon, you know.

168
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,934
提交离职请求都是十分正常的
Even for a captain,to want to leave.

169
00:15:00,731 --> 00:15:04,397
在广阔的宇宙中没有相对位置
There's no relative direction in the vastness of space...

170
00:15:05,261 --> 00:15:07,312
只能靠你自己
...there's only yourself.

171
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:10,073
你的星舰和你的船员
Your ship, your crew.

172
00:15:11,775 --> 00:15:14,800
很容易就在太空中迷失自我
It's easier than you think to get lost.

173
00:15:15,259 --> 00:15:17,409
我会和最高理事会讨论你的申请
I'll really talk with the General Council.

174
00:15:17,444 --> 00:15:19,026
等你回来我们再议
We'll discuss it, when you return.

175
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:33,932
- 史波克先生 - 船长
- Mr. Spock. - Captain.

176
00:15:35,998 --> 00:15:37,172
- 我有些事... - 我想...
- I have something... - Perhaps there...

177
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,642
- 不，你先说 - 船长，你说完我再说
- No, please. - Captain, after you.

178
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,162
我坚持如此
I insist.

179
00:15:43,912 --> 00:15:45,656
这次任务完成后
After this mission, we should...

180
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,448
我们得坐下来好好谈谈
...we should sit down.There is something I need to talk about.

181
00:15:48,473 --> 00:15:50,352
我也想跟您好好谈谈
I, as well, have something to share.

182
00:15:56,701 --> 00:15:58,526
我们合作愉快，没错吧？
We make a good team, right?

183
00:16:00,905 --> 00:16:02,264
我对此深信不疑
I believe we do.

184
00:16:06,577 --> 00:16:07,890
我坚持你先走
I insist.

185
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:29,863
乌胡拉中尉，打开全船广播
Lt. Uhura, open a ship wide channel.

186
00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:30,893
是，船长
Yes, Captain.

187
00:16:34,173 --> 00:16:36,021
全体进取号船员注意
Attention, crew of the Enterprise.

188
00:16:36,714 --> 00:16:39,221
我们这次任务目的明确
Our mission is straightforward.

189
00:16:39,676 --> 00:16:43,230
到一片未知星域中营救一艘失事飞船的船员
The rescue of a crew stranded on a planet in uncharted space.

190
00:16:43,622 --> 00:16:46,732
我们的航线会经过一片不稳定的星云
Our trajectory will take us through an unstable nebula...

191
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:50,185
届时我们将会中断同星际舰队总部的所有联系
...one which will disable all communication with Starfleet.

192
00:16:51,752 --> 00:16:53,189
我们只能依靠我们自己
We will be on our own.

193
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:56,825
请记住进取号有着其它星舰都没有的东西
The Enteprise has something no other ship in the fleet has.

194
00:16:57,727 --> 00:16:59,001
那就是各位船员们
You.

195
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:03,603
我一直坚信没有什么是未知的
As we can't understand there's no such space, the unknown.

196
00:17:05,354 --> 00:17:07,632
只不过是暂时不为人知罢了
We'll be temporarily hidden.

197
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:09,329
柯克广播结束
Kirk out.

198
00:17:29,725 --> 00:17:32,949
度数显示星云密度正在降低，长官
Readings indicate cloud density deminishing, sir.

199
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:47,626
那就是奥尔塔米德，我的飞船就迫降在那
This is Altamid.Our ship is stranded here.

200
00:18:02,756 --> 00:18:04,829
接近奥尔塔米德星球
Approaching Altamid.

201
00:18:04,896 --> 00:18:06,535
星球等级M
Class M planet.

202
00:18:07,189 --> 00:18:11,182
地底活动较为活跃，但是表面几乎没有任何生命体存在
Massive subterranean fauna, with unlimited unknown life forms on the surface...

203
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:12,593
距离警报，长官
Proximity alert, sir.

204
00:18:12,628 --> 00:18:14,702
有一艘未知飞船正在靠近我们
We have an unknown ship heading right on us.

205
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:16,269
- 乌胡拉中尉，呼叫他们 - 是，船长
- Lt. Uhura, hail them. - Yes, Captain.

206
00:18:22,595 --> 00:18:23,668
没有回复
No response.

207
00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:25,830
什么信号都收不到
I'm picking up some kind of a signal.

208
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,973
我们这是被干扰了吧
They are jamming us.

209
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,438
苏鲁先生，放大图像
Magnify, Mr. Sulu.

210
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:40,769
这是什么？
What is this?

211
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,060
打开防护罩！拉响警报！
Shields up! Red alert!

212
00:18:52,161 --> 00:18:53,873
自由开火！
Fire at will!

213
00:19:01,186 --> 00:19:03,298
长官，相位炮效果过于微弱
Sir, our phasers are having minimal effect

214
00:19:03,386 --> 00:19:05,202
我们的鱼雷无法探测到敌人的移动轨迹
and our torpedoes can't track the movement.

215
00:19:05,363 --> 00:19:06,703
把所有能打的都打出去
Fire everything we've got.

216
00:19:06,704 --> 00:19:09,146
船长，我们所有的武器都无法胜任这种类型的交火
Captain, we are not equipped for this matteral engadgement.

217
00:19:20,755 --> 00:19:22,703
防护罩对敌无效，长官
Shields frequency has no effect, sir.

218
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:23,828
他们摧毁了我们的引擎
They got the DITCH.

219
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,261
防护罩失灵
Shields are offline.

220
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:29,206
- 启动曲速引擎离开这里，苏鲁先生 - 是，长官
- Warp us out of here, Mr. Sulu. - Yes, sir.

221
00:19:37,123 --> 00:19:40,053
- 为什么飞船没有开始曲速移动？ - 长官，无法启动曲速引擎
- Why the hell aren't we moving? - I can not engage the warp drive, sir.

222
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,584
斯科特，马上去排查故障，我们要进入曲速状态
Scotty, I need warp now.

223
00:19:48,816 --> 00:19:50,894
长官，我无法完成任务
I can not, sir.

224
00:19:59,089 --> 00:20:00,584
引擎没了
...they are gone.

225
00:20:01,373 --> 00:20:04,157
启动所有安全应急程序
Security, engage all emergency procedures.

226
00:20:06,692 --> 00:20:08,825
所有人员到都去急救站报道
All personnel to emergency stations.

227
00:20:31,923 --> 00:20:34,780
12层至15层发现船体破损
I have hull breaches in levels 12 to 15,

228
00:20:34,903 --> 00:20:38,282
6.9.31.21层也发现船体破损
6, 9, 31 and 21, sir.

229
00:20:38,283 --> 00:20:41,600
船长，我有个办法能从曲速引擎核心转移能量
Captain, in a 10 sec I could reroute the energy from the warp core

230
00:20:41,601 --> 00:20:43,344
到推进器
to the impulse engines.

231
00:20:43,566 --> 00:20:45,698
疏散所有人员
If we can get back into the nebula maybe we can lose them

232
00:20:45,723 --> 00:20:47,202
放手去做吧，斯科特
Do whatever you have to, Scotty.

233
00:20:47,687 --> 00:20:49,667
昆赛尔，跟我来
Keenser let's go.

234
00:21:15,249 --> 00:21:16,703
道路清理完毕，克劳
All clear, krall.

235
00:21:59,691 --> 00:22:02,503
这就是遗失的安布罗纳斯碎片
Connecting plasma pipes,stand by then you start it on my mark!

236
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:21,158
武器已经找全了
I have the Abronath.Secure the ship.

237
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,467
船长呼叫史波克
- Captain. - Go, Spock.

238
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:30,890
我发现了他们的一个长官，他似乎是这次进攻行动的总指挥
I've identified the individual intruder and leading the attack party.

239
00:22:31,355 --> 00:22:33,682
他们潜入了档案室，拿走了我们
They infiltrated the archive vault,and removed the artifact

240
00:22:33,721 --> 00:22:34,895
原本打算赠送给提纳兹星球的手工品
from our mission on Teenax.

241
00:22:34,951 --> 00:22:36,272
坚持住，我们马上...
Hold your idstance until...

242
00:22:37,214 --> 00:22:39,051
史波克！史波克！
Spock! Spock!

243
00:22:40,338 --> 00:22:42,168
你们俩跟我来，苏鲁，你来临时指挥
You two, with me.Sulu, you are commanding officer.

244
00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:43,269
是，长官
Yes, sir.

245
00:23:06,262 --> 00:23:07,557
我的天！
My god!

246
00:23:11,342 --> 00:23:12,606
这是什么情况！
...the hell?

247
00:23:16,524 --> 00:23:17,636
医生？
Doctor?

248
00:23:20,571 --> 00:23:22,411
医生，我们得撤了
Doctor, we must evacuate now!

249
00:23:58,294 --> 00:24:00,689
柯克
Captain

250
00:24:00,913 --> 00:24:02,913
船长
Kirk

251
00:24:20,756 --> 00:24:22,929
推进器充能完毕
Yes!We have 100% impulse.

252
00:24:23,122 --> 00:24:24,734
斯科特先生，干的漂亮
Great work, Mr. Scott!

253
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:26,584
启动推进器，驶向星云
Maximum impulse towards the nebula!

254
00:24:26,619 --> 00:24:27,637
是
Ay!

255
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,573
克劳，他们要逃进星云去了
Krall, the ship runs into nebula.

256
00:24:49,008 --> 00:24:51,002
割开他们的喉咙
Cut it's neck.

257
00:25:57,149 --> 00:25:58,761
柯克呼叫舰桥
Kirk to bridge.

258
00:25:59,406 --> 00:26:01,772
惯性阻尼器已损坏
We are losing the innertial dampers.

259
00:26:01,773 --> 00:26:03,798
船长，全船系统都崩溃了
Systems are failing throughout the ship, Captain.

260
00:26:04,132 --> 00:26:05,596
应急面板已激活
The emergency blockades are sealing...

261
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:08,866
但全船结构完整性只有18%并正在降低，长官！
...but the structural integrity is at 18% and falling, sir.

262
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,924
苏鲁先生，全员弃船
Abandon ship, Mr. Sulu.

263
00:26:14,113 --> 00:26:15,797
拉响警报
Sound the alarm.

264
00:26:21,533 --> 00:26:23,540
我们要给这些救生舱逃走创造机会
Maybe in those Pods it's a chance to escape

265
00:26:23,585 --> 00:26:25,174
到时候你能把飞船开远点么
Can you lead the ship away?

266
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:28,670
推进器还在从备用的曲速引擎核心汲取能量
The impulse engines are still trying to draw power from the warp reserve.

267
00:26:28,695 --> 00:26:31,704
在启动碟形分离程序前我们都动不了
We can not move until the SAUCER is separated.

268
00:26:32,461 --> 00:26:33,654
我来搞定这个
I'll handle it.

269
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:34,927
好的，长官
Ay ay, sir.

270
00:26:48,367 --> 00:26:51,085
赶快把他们带到救生舱去，快去
We got to get you guys to escape pod. Go.

271
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,324
希尔少尉
Ensign. Syl.

272
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,820
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

273
00:26:56,596 --> 00:26:57,736
是，长官
Yes, sir.

274
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,240
天啊！
My god!

275
00:27:30,673 --> 00:27:32,368
史波克，他们正在抓船员！
Spock, they are taking the crew.

276
00:28:08,905 --> 00:28:09,735
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

277
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,364
飞船碟形部分应该没人了
SAUCER should be free by now.

278
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:14,035
我明白，苏鲁先生，但船长应该就在那边
I know, Mr. Sulu.The Captain should be there.

279
00:29:41,496 --> 00:29:42,683
<i>碟形部分已分离</i>
<i>SAUCER SEPARATION</i>

280
00:30:05,725 --> 00:30:08,997
推动引擎现在改由辅助发电机驱动了
The impulse engines drawing power from auxiliary generators.

281
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,932
船长
Captain.

282
00:30:22,901 --> 00:30:24,953
碟形区那边还有船员吗
How many of the crew is still pod disposal?

283
00:30:26,544 --> 00:30:27,698
没了
None.

284
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,471
如果这些仪器工作正常的话
If I read this correctly...

285
00:30:30,404 --> 00:30:31,892
入侵者正在抓捕船员
...the intruders are taking them.

286
00:30:32,129 --> 00:30:34,899
船长，我们被星球重力吸引了
Captain, we're caught in the planet's gravity.

287
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:37,251
我们开不走了
We can not pull away.

288
00:30:41,874 --> 00:30:43,565
你们上救生舱吧
Get your captain pods.

289
00:30:44,014 --> 00:30:45,595
是，长官
- Yes, sir. - Ay, Captain.

290
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:46,854
快，我们走
Come on! Let's go!

291
00:33:25,549 --> 00:33:26,549
你早就
You knew...

292
00:33:26,574 --> 00:33:28,353
知道我们会被袭击
You knew we would be attacked.

293
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:29,932
你还不明白现在发生的一切
You don't understand.

294
00:33:30,861 --> 00:33:32,027
柯克船长
Captain Kirk.

295
00:33:38,326 --> 00:33:40,590
是的，我撒谎了
Yes, I lied.

296
00:33:42,001 --> 00:33:44,590
我的飞船也被攻击了
Our ship was attacked.

297
00:33:46,161 --> 00:33:48,233
契科夫，找一找有没有生还者的信号
Chekov, check your comms for survivors.

298
00:33:48,268 --> 00:33:49,557
是，长官
Ay ay, ay Captain.

299
00:33:49,592 --> 00:33:52,335
- 他是什么人？ - 他叫克劳
- Who is he? - His name is Krall.

300
00:33:53,921 --> 00:33:57,277
他抓走了我的船员，也抓走了你的
He took my crew,like he took yours.

301
00:33:57,351 --> 00:33:59,227
他怎么会对进取号那么了解？
How did he know so much about the Enterprise?

302
00:33:59,262 --> 00:34:02,779
我只知道我按他说的把你们引到这里来
All I know is that if I did this...

303
00:34:04,703 --> 00:34:06,677
他就会放走我的船员
...he'll set them free.

304
00:34:06,909 --> 00:34:09,525
契科夫，扫描仪上发现了信号吗？
Chekov, are you picking anything upon those scanners?

305
00:34:10,926 --> 00:34:12,365
没有，长官
Nothing.

306
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:15,916
- 他们会不会已经... - 不会的
- What if he... - No, no.

307
00:34:16,993 --> 00:34:18,356
他们肯定活下来了
He was taking them.

308
00:34:18,644 --> 00:34:20,501
我们得找到飞船的碟形部
We have to find that SAUCER even

309
00:34:20,536 --> 00:34:23,752
你可以利用船上的扫描仪，扫描范围比你手上的三角仪大多了
minimal scanning systems will have longer range than tricorders.

310
00:34:23,787 --> 00:34:25,527
好的，船长，这个方案是可行的
Ay, Captain. It's possible.

311
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:30,272
船长，我这么做只是为了保护我的船员
Captain, I was protecting my crew.

312
00:35:30,113 --> 00:35:32,378
你叫什么？
What is your name?

313
00:35:34,704 --> 00:35:36,383
你怎么会说我的语言？
How do you know our language?

314
00:35:36,849 --> 00:35:39,442
我还很了解你们这个物种呢
I know your kind.

315
00:35:40,871 --> 00:35:43,850
我是进取号通讯官，妮欧塔 乌胡拉
I'm Lt. Nyota Uhura of the USS Enteprise.

316
00:35:44,097 --> 00:35:46,645
你已经发起了一场战争对抗联...
And you have committed an act of war against Fede...

317
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,490
星际联邦
Federation.

318
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:53,246
星际联邦就是战争的代名词
Federation is an act of war.

319
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,989
你攻击了我们
You've attacked us.

320
00:36:00,145 --> 00:36:02,218
你的船长...
Your captain...

321
00:36:03,186 --> 00:36:07,393
为什么你会牺牲自己去救他？
Why did you sacrifice yourself for him?

322
00:36:07,438 --> 00:36:08,799
换做他，在这种情况下他也会这么做
He would have done the same.

323
00:36:09,587 --> 00:36:12,650
如果他从船上逃走了，他就会来救我们
And if he made it off that ship,he will come for us.

324
00:36:14,108 --> 00:36:19,099
我正指望着他来呢，乌胡拉中尉
I'm counting on it, Lt. Uhura.

325
00:36:48,011 --> 00:36:49,666
简直难以置信
I can't believe it.

326
00:36:59,795 --> 00:37:01,015
我的天，史波克！
My god, Spock!

327
00:37:05,495 --> 00:37:06,795
赶紧到那边走下来
Sit down over here.

328
00:37:08,706 --> 00:37:10,174
慢点，慢点
Okay, easy, easy.

329
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:16,757
行，我现在打算...
I'll just a...

330
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,616
你放松就好，没事的
Try to relax.Your're going to be okay.

331
00:37:18,641 --> 00:37:20,512
你语气里那种不自然的乐观
Forced optimism in your voice suggests

332
00:37:20,513 --> 00:37:22,862
表明你正努力让自己进入平静状态...
you are trying to enlist essensive calm in order...

333
00:37:22,863 --> 00:37:23,963
省省你这些垃圾话吧
Cut the horse shit.

334
00:37:23,964 --> 00:37:27,286
医生，就目前情况来看，我们应该尽力寻找
Doctor. I failed to see how excrement of any kind feels relevance

335
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:28,831
其他的幸存船员
in our current situation.

336
00:37:29,243 --> 00:37:31,232
- 你他丫的在干什么？ - 我们应该马上开始行动
- What the hell are you doing? - We must keep moving, doctor.

337
00:37:31,257 --> 00:37:33,220
史波克，这玩意都刺穿了你的腹部了
Spock, this thing punched your iliac region.

338
00:37:33,245 --> 00:37:35,785
- 时间是十分重要的 - 我还正想跟你说这个呢
- Time is a critical factor. - That's exactly what I am trying to tell you.

339
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:37,951
听着，如果我不把这东西拔出来，你就死定了
Look, I can't take this out.You are gonna die.

340
00:37:37,976 --> 00:37:41,096
如果我把这东西拔出来，但是止不住血，你也死定了
Okay, if I take it out and can't stop the bleeding, you are gonna die.

341
00:37:41,121 --> 00:37:43,275
我能不能两个都不选
I can't see no appealing neither option.

342
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,968
你没得选，我也没得选
Believe me or not,neither can I.

343
00:37:46,744 --> 00:37:49,840
嗯，如果我没记错的话
So, if I remember correctly

344
00:37:50,778 --> 00:37:55,316
瓦肯人心脏和人类肝脏的位置是一样的
you got Vulcans of your hearts,where humans have their livers.

345
00:37:55,341 --> 00:37:57,109
你说的没错，医生
That is correct, doctor.

346
00:37:58,274 --> 00:37:59,939
怪不得
That explains some things.

347
00:38:02,235 --> 00:38:05,256
你知道你运气有多好么，如果那玩意扎的位置再往左移两寸
You know, you are lucky.Two centimeters to the left...

348
00:38:07,643 --> 00:38:09,138
你早就死了
...and you would be dead already.

349
00:38:10,543 --> 00:38:12,015
我真是想不通，史波克
I just don't get it, Spock.

350
00:38:13,804 --> 00:38:16,057
他们为啥要攻击我们
What did they attack us for?I mean...

351
00:38:16,896 --> 00:38:21,026
他们吃饱了没事就以跟别人开战为乐么
They do all this for some <i>duedad</i> with the tiny clevers didn't want?

352
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:24,904
藐视一个你不了解的人的意图是不明智的，医生
It is unwise to trivialize that which one simply does not understand, Doctor.

353
00:38:25,364 --> 00:38:28,256
我们只能简单的假设说他们的目的肯定不简单
We can safely assume that it's more important than a <i>duedad</i>.

354
00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:31,281
你居然用一句话嘲讽了我两次，史波克
I think you just managed to insult me twice, Spock.

355
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:41,614
好了，史波克
Alright, Spock.

356
00:38:41,712 --> 00:38:43,585
最后问你一个问题
Just got one question.

357
00:38:43,686 --> 00:38:46,274
- 你最喜欢的颜色是什么？ - 我不明白你为什么突然问...
- What's your favorite color? - I failed to see the relevance...

358
00:38:51,651 --> 00:38:54,055
他们告诉我说感到惊讶时你就不会觉得很痛了
Yeah, they say it hurts less if it's a surprise.

359
00:38:55,316 --> 00:38:57,686
如果要我用我们都熟悉的说法来形容
I made a doctor parlance with which you are familiar...

360
00:38:57,721 --> 00:39:01,324
你所说的，我觉得你说的说法就是“垃圾”
...I can confirm your theory to be horse shit.

361
00:39:04,722 --> 00:39:06,011
我们走
We gotta get out of here.

362
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,397
这他妈的就是在逗我
You're kidding me, aren't you?

363
00:39:44,546 --> 00:39:45,583
你们好
Hello there.

364
00:39:46,235 --> 00:39:48,170
我是蒙哥马利 斯科特
My name is Montgomery Scott... and...

365
00:39:48,942 --> 00:39:50,306
你们是？
...who might you be?

366
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:55,227
注意点，你们这些家伙，我可比你们想象的身手好多了
Watch it sonny,I am pretty handy when I want to be... right.

367
00:40:40,809 --> 00:40:42,321
别再来找我麻烦了
No come back.

368
00:40:43,252 --> 00:40:45,040
美女，身手不错啊
Well, we surely show <i>*something*</i>

369
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:48,568
这些是舰队的财产，你不能就这么拿走了...
Hey! That's Starfleet property...You can not just take them and....

370
00:40:48,569 --> 00:40:51,468
但是我今天心情很好你就随便拿吧
...but, I'm feeling generous today so have at it.

371
00:40:52,831 --> 00:40:54,001
那玩意你是在哪找到的？
Where did you get that?

372
00:40:54,256 --> 00:40:56,804
- 你会说英语？ - 我在我房子里学会的，你这玩意在哪拿的？
- Is that English? - I learned it from my house. Where did you get that ?

373
00:40:56,901 --> 00:40:59,366
- 这是我的星舰军官徽章 - 那是什么意思？
- This is my Starfleet insignia. - What does it mean ?

374
00:40:59,467 --> 00:41:02,801
它代表着我是一位来自星舰轮机部的军官
Means that I am an officer of a Starfleet's engineering division.

375
00:41:04,552 --> 00:41:06,669
- 轮机部？ - 是的，我负责修东西
- Engineering? - Ay yes, I fix things.

376
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,718
我知道那是啥意思
I know what is engineering.

377
00:41:10,507 --> 00:41:13,122
你知道是谁击落了我的飞船吧？
You're not with those bastards who killed my ship are ya?

378
00:41:14,683 --> 00:41:15,795
我就当你不知道了
I take that as a no.

379
00:41:18,023 --> 00:41:20,365
他叫克劳，他和他的...
He is Krall. He and his...

380
00:41:21,691 --> 00:41:22,812
蜂群
...bees.

381
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:25,132
他们在找一个东西，一个杀人机器
They searched the stars for ya.Death machine.

382
00:41:25,353 --> 00:41:28,401
这就是为什么你和我们所有人现在在这的原因
They are the reason why you are here,why we are all here.

383
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:30,788
也包括刚刚那些流氓吗？
Even those 3 scunners?

384
00:41:32,377 --> 00:41:35,188
他们也是飞船坠毁的幸存者，就像你我一样
They have fallen from the sky,like me and you.

385
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:39,066
现在跟我走！
Come with me. Now!

386
00:41:39,594 --> 00:41:42,164
等会，小姑娘，我今天过的很不顺
Wait, hang on a minute.I had a difficult day here.

387
00:41:43,038 --> 00:41:44,890
我要去找我的朋友
I gotta fing my crewmates.

388
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,147
我会帮你找到你的朋友
I will help you find your mates...

389
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:50,003
然后你来帮我一个忙
...and then you will help me.

390
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:52,204
帮你什么？
With what?

391
00:41:53,528 --> 00:41:55,513
- 你要我帮你修东西？ - 对
- You want me to fix something? - Yes.

392
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:57,240
你帮我，我就帮你
You help me and I help you.

393
00:41:58,998 --> 00:42:01,532
那么，考虑到现在的情况，我看我是没得选了
Alright, well things have been nasty all day,and I won't get better offer today.

394
00:42:01,626 --> 00:42:02,855
我跟你走
So lead the way.

395
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,907
很好
Good.

396
00:42:04,275 --> 00:42:05,474
我叫婕拉
I am Jaylah.

397
00:42:06,044 --> 00:42:08,682
- 你是蒙哥马利 斯科特 - 对，叫我斯考提就好（斯科特的昵称）
- And you're Montgomery Scott. - Ay, Scotty.

398
00:42:09,947 --> 00:42:12,334
跟我走，蒙哥马利 斯考提
Come now, Montgomery Scotty.

399
00:42:14,363 --> 00:42:15,451
等等我
Alright, hold up.

400
00:42:32,267 --> 00:42:34,348
进取号
The Enterprise.

401
00:42:34,699 --> 00:42:39,160
可能都无法为舰桥供电了，船长
It may not even have power to the bridge, Captain.

402
00:42:42,103 --> 00:42:44,879
这个外星女人身上肯定还有不为人知的秘密
She still has a few tricks up her sleeve.

403
00:42:46,767 --> 00:42:48,311
我敢打包票
I bet on it.

404
00:42:50,438 --> 00:42:52,286
麦考伊呼叫进取号，收到请回答
McCoy to Enterprise, come in.

405
00:42:53,368 --> 00:42:54,961
麦考伊呼叫进取号
McCoy to Enterprise.

406
00:42:58,223 --> 00:43:01,125
走慢点，史波克，我只是临时缝合了一下
Hey, take it easy there, Spock.That was just a temporary fix back there.

407
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:03,054
知道了，医生
I understand, Doctor.

408
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:10,315
真是个迷人的洞穴
Fascinating.

409
00:43:10,444 --> 00:43:12,496
胡说，明明是危险又黑暗的洞穴
Omuns, dark, dangerous.

410
00:43:16,083 --> 00:43:17,442
不管怎么说我们还是进去吧
We are going in.

411
00:43:38,506 --> 00:43:39,554
真是有趣
Intriguing.

412
00:43:39,589 --> 00:43:43,624
这里的符号和袭击中被偷走的文物上的那些符号一模一样
These symbols are the same as those that we picked on the artifact taken in the attack.

413
00:43:43,659 --> 00:43:44,872
你认为那个文物来自于这个星球？
You think it came from here?

414
00:43:46,286 --> 00:43:47,946
看起来是这样
It would seem so.

415
00:43:51,944 --> 00:43:53,266
史波克！
Damm it... Spock!

416
00:44:03,092 --> 00:44:04,092
走快点
Hurry.

417
00:44:05,176 --> 00:44:07,732
- 还有多远？ - 闭嘴，别问了
- Aren't we there yet? - Stop asking that.

418
00:44:07,943 --> 00:44:10,413
- 抱歉 - 走这边，进来
- Sorry. - This is the way, come.

419
00:44:11,735 --> 00:44:14,680
小心点，别掉到我的陷阱里去了
Watch your steps,you do not want to set up my traps.

420
00:44:16,732 --> 00:44:18,732
哦，这真聪明
Oh, that's clever.

421
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,876
这是什么地方？
What is this place?

422
00:44:22,157 --> 00:44:24,807
- 这是我的房子 - 你的房子？
- This is my house. - Your house ?

423
00:44:26,728 --> 00:44:27,851
这是一艘飞船吗？
Is this a ship?

424
00:44:27,943 --> 00:44:30,871
我希望你能找到你的朋友们，然后你们来帮我修这艘飞船
I hope you find your friends and you help me fix it.

425
00:44:31,463 --> 00:44:33,641
这样我就能永远的离开这个星球了
So I can leave this planet forever.

426
00:44:34,763 --> 00:44:36,047
等等
Wo... Wait a minute.

427
00:44:36,315 --> 00:44:37,633
这是你的船吗？
Is this your ship?

428
00:44:37,987 --> 00:44:39,994
不，蒙哥马利 斯科特
No, Montgomery Scotty.

429
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:43,754
这是你们的船
It's yours.

430
00:44:44,578 --> 00:44:46,578
我的天哪
Oh my good lord.

431
00:44:46,602 --> 00:44:49,987
富兰克林号 星舰代码NX 326
<i> U.S.S Franklin - Starfleet</i>

432
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:56,280
船长，看起来船体已经彻底失去动力了
Captain, it looks like there is power.

433
00:44:56,811 --> 00:44:59,861
好吧，我们到舰桥上去，想办法找到幸存的船员
Alright, let's get to the bridge and find the crew.

434
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:43,249
控制台完好无损，船长
The console is intacted, and I will...

435
00:45:44,026 --> 00:45:45,583
我来试着重启它
...try to reroute power to it.

436
00:45:46,379 --> 00:45:47,396
动作快点
Work fast.

437
00:45:47,474 --> 00:45:50,548
启动这些仪器后，灯火通明的房间肯定会招来不少敌人
Once we get this place run,we are gonna draw a lot of attention.

438
00:45:52,069 --> 00:45:53,511
怎么样？你能找到他们吗？
What do you think? You can find them?

439
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:54,468
我试试，船长
Ay, Captain.

440
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:58,173
我来重新配置一下扫描仪，调整一下频率
I am reconfiguring scanners to modulate for the crews sequence.

441
00:46:02,105 --> 00:46:04,729
你跟我来，我在船上落下了点东西
You with me.I left something behind.

442
00:46:16,886 --> 00:46:18,198
还好你感冒了，要不然我们就出不去了
That is one heck of a cold.

443
00:46:18,249 --> 00:46:19,813
干的漂亮，昆赛尔
Nice job, Keenser.

444
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:24,409
动作快点，距离下一班哨兵轮岗还有15分钟
Alright, we got about 15 minutes until the next guard rotation.

445
00:46:24,644 --> 00:46:25,700
快点
Come on.

446
00:46:33,109 --> 00:46:34,274
快点跟上，走
Let's go, go.

447
00:46:41,078 --> 00:46:42,026
快点
Come on!

448
00:46:50,445 --> 00:46:52,116
这是一个麦哲伦探针
This is a Magellan probe.

449
00:46:52,969 --> 00:46:55,741
星联用它们来寻找通往星云的航线
Federation is using these to find a way through the nebula.

450
00:46:56,527 --> 00:46:58,234
克劳怎么会用到这个
What he is using it for?

451
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:27,313
你发现了什么？
What do you see?

452
00:47:30,655 --> 00:47:33,759
他借助探针之间的子链路传递信息
He's been pinging back in a subspace links between the probes.

453
00:47:34,674 --> 00:47:36,692
我们能利用这个发送求助信号吗
Well, use it to send a distress signal.

454
00:47:37,677 --> 00:47:38,924
我试试看
I am trying.

455
00:47:43,811 --> 00:47:44,880
信号已发送
Sent.

456
00:47:45,008 --> 00:47:46,873
他访问过约克镇的数据库
He has access to Yorktown database.

457
00:47:47,627 --> 00:47:48,346
你说什么？
What?

458
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:52,126
这些是星舰的数据库，相关文件
That's Startfleet datafiles... ship logs...

459
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:54,850
进取号的文件也包括在内
...including the Enterprise.

460
00:47:55,951 --> 00:47:58,198
原来他一直在监视我们
He's been watching us this whole time.

461
00:48:13,626 --> 00:48:15,626
船长
Captain...

462
00:48:15,651 --> 00:48:17,823
这文物一直都放在船上吗？
...the artifact was on the ship the whole time?

463
00:48:18,699 --> 00:48:20,771
我可不想带着它被人抓住
I cannot afford to get caught with it.

464
00:48:20,806 --> 00:48:22,372
所以我就把它藏在这了
So I hid it in here.

465
00:48:28,078 --> 00:48:31,365
告诉克劳，我拿到安布罗纳斯了
Tell Krall... I have the Abronath.

466
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:35,303
你是不是相信所有你听过的悲惨故事？
Do you really swallow my sad story you hear?

467
00:48:37,829 --> 00:48:39,189
我可不会全信
Not every.

468
00:48:39,809 --> 00:48:43,424
请把你手里的枪放下
Put the phaser down. Please.

469
00:48:47,495 --> 00:48:49,115
找到了吗，契科夫
You get it, Chekov?

470
00:48:49,374 --> 00:48:51,929
找到了，已经确认了与她通话人的位置
Ay, Captain. I've traced her location of her comm.

471
00:48:58,823 --> 00:49:00,683
为什么克劳想要这东西？
What does Krall want with this thing?

472
00:49:01,892 --> 00:49:03,822
他是来拯救你们的
To save you.

473
00:49:04,223 --> 00:49:05,822
从你们内部
From yourselves.

474
00:49:05,823 --> 00:49:06,823
长官！
Captain!

475
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:54,893
- 你还好么？ - 我很好，船长，但是我们已经被困住了
- You all right? - Ay, Captain, but we are trapped.

476
00:50:05,467 --> 00:50:06,829
你能启动推进器吗？
Can you get this thing started?

477
00:50:06,854 --> 00:50:09,724
你确定现在发动引擎？
Are you intending inition...  engage the thrusters?

478
00:50:09,749 --> 00:50:11,368
你还有更好的办法么
I am open up for suggestions.

479
00:50:11,393 --> 00:50:12,440
好吧
Okay.

480
00:50:15,841 --> 00:50:17,447
- 现在有个问题 - 啥问题
- There's the problem, sir. - What?

481
00:50:17,493 --> 00:50:20,059
管道出问题了，我没法让燃料燃烧
It's the pipe.I can not init to combust.

482
00:50:21,298 --> 00:50:24,276
船长，现在情况很紧急
Captain, we are basically standing on a very large bomb.

483
00:50:24,282 --> 00:50:25,750
如果你没打中燃料压缩机...
If you miss the combustion compressor.

484
00:50:25,762 --> 00:50:26,873
我从不会失手，别说了
I am not gonna miss, come on.

485
00:50:26,963 --> 00:50:28,898
你知道燃料压缩机长什么样么？
Do you even know how the compressor looks like?

486
00:50:29,113 --> 00:50:30,389
是方形的吧？
As squared, right?

487
00:50:30,474 --> 00:50:32,208
不，是圆形的
No, it's round.

488
00:50:32,275 --> 00:50:33,808
刚好我打偏了！
That's what I said.

489
00:51:22,686 --> 00:51:23,706
契科夫
Chekov!

490
00:51:57,215 --> 00:51:59,762
契科夫，快跑！
Chekov, move!

491
00:52:57,159 --> 00:52:59,550
你以为你们明白
You think you know...

492
00:52:59,585 --> 00:53:04,184
牺牲的真正含义么
...what sacrifice really means?

493
00:53:07,411 --> 00:53:09,990
星联告诉你们
Federation has thought you...

494
00:53:10,025 --> 00:53:13,320
银河间不应存在冲突
...that conflict should not exist!

495
00:53:19,173 --> 00:53:21,536
但是没有争斗
But without stronger,

496
00:53:22,743 --> 00:53:26,749
你们永远不会明白你们自己的潜力
You'll never know who you trully are.

497
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:28,834
你根本不了解我们
You have no idea who we are.

498
00:53:30,439 --> 00:53:32,474
但你马上就会明白了
But you'll soon find out.

499
00:53:32,764 --> 00:53:37,196
你是想说你发送了求救信号，会有人来救你们么？
You mean the distress signal you thought you sent?

500
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,609
坐标已经被修改过了
The coordinates were altered.

501
00:53:43,727 --> 00:53:46,640
你们的救援队会被困在星云里一无所获
Your rescue ships will be stranded in the nebula...

502
00:53:46,641 --> 00:53:49,784
而你们的基地将会门户大开
...and your base left, full open.

503
00:53:51,341 --> 00:53:53,189
原来你要袭击约克城号基地
You go to attack Yorktown.

504
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:57,396
数以百万计的来自星际联盟各个星球上的人
Millions of souls from every Federation world...

505
00:53:57,397 --> 00:53:59,130
聚集在那里
...holding hands.

506
00:53:59,956 --> 00:54:01,956
那是一个完美的目标
It's a perfect target.

507
00:54:01,982 --> 00:54:03,644
你不会得逞的
You are wrong.

508
00:54:03,669 --> 00:54:05,669
团结就是力量
There is strength in unity.

509
00:54:10,579 --> 00:54:13,853
正是那些反抗的力量
The strength of others... Lieutenant...

510
00:54:14,175 --> 00:54:17,600
让我能够活下去
... is what has kept me alive.

511
00:54:17,637 --> 00:54:19,501
不！
No!

512
00:54:43,727 --> 00:54:44,727
史波克
Spock!

513
00:54:45,752 --> 00:54:47,165
史波克，你丫的醒醒！
Spock, wake up damn it!

514
00:54:50,546 --> 00:54:52,528
医生，我现在很清醒
I am entirely conscious, doctor.

515
00:54:53,409 --> 00:54:55,928
我只不过是在冥想，思考人生的自然规律
I am simply contemplating the nature of mortality.

516
00:54:57,505 --> 00:54:59,278
你倒好，现在变成哲学家了
You feel philosophical, huh?

517
00:55:01,537 --> 00:55:03,809
是因为失血过多脑子不太清醒吧
You have mass blood loss into that tria.

518
00:55:06,606 --> 00:55:09,827
你曾问过我为什么和乌胡拉闹矛盾了
You asked me why Lt. Uhura and I parted ways.

519
00:55:11,553 --> 00:55:13,637
考虑到瓦肯星已经被摧毁
I became concerned...

520
00:55:13,661 --> 00:55:15,637
我越发的觉得
...in the light of Vulcans demise

521
00:55:15,738 --> 00:55:18,205
我应该担负起聚集族人的责任
and would have had a duty to my species.

522
00:55:20,085 --> 00:55:22,612
所以你要去传宗接代？
You thought you should be off making little Vulcans, huh?

523
00:55:24,651 --> 00:55:27,289
我懂了，这让她很不安
Yup, I can see how that'd upset her.

524
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,273
我本来想跟她谈一谈这个问题
I intended to discuss it with her further

525
00:55:30,308 --> 00:55:33,339
但我突然得知了一个对我触动很深的消息
but I received some news which affected me unexpectedly.

526
00:55:35,977 --> 00:55:37,442
什么消息？
What news?

527
00:55:39,051 --> 00:55:41,191
史波克大使去世了
Ambassador Spock is dead.

528
00:55:45,601 --> 00:55:47,385
史波克，我很难过
Spock, I'm so sorry.

529
00:55:50,909 --> 00:55:54,297
无法想象你有多么悲伤
I can not imagine what that must feel like.

530
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:03,600
如果你像他一样活了那么多年
When you lived this many lifes as he...

531
00:56:04,674 --> 00:56:06,727
你就不会再畏惧死亡了
Fear of death is illogical.

532
00:56:09,057 --> 00:56:11,535
对于死亡的恐惧
Fear of death...

533
00:56:12,582 --> 00:56:14,582
是让我们活下去的动力
... is what keeps us alive.

534
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,065
我想活的像他一样充实
I don't want to live as he did.

535
00:56:24,458 --> 00:56:26,083
这就是为什么我打算用我的余生
That is why I decided...

536
00:56:27,294 --> 00:56:29,806
到新瓦肯星上
...to redirect my efforts and continue his work...

537
00:56:31,341 --> 00:56:32,809
继续完成他的工作
...On New Vulcan.

538
00:56:36,199 --> 00:56:37,972
你要离开星际舰队？
You are leaving Starfleet?

539
00:56:42,455 --> 00:56:44,271
吉姆怎么想的？
What Jim have to say about that?

540
00:56:46,139 --> 00:56:50,460
我还没找到合适的时间来跟他谈这个
I could not find the time to tell him.

541
00:56:50,461 --> 00:56:52,547
我现在就能告诉你，他听到了你的想法肯定会不开心的
Oh, I can tell you he is not gonna like that.

542
00:56:54,112 --> 00:56:56,331
不知道没了你，他会怎么办
Hell, I don't know what he'll do without ya.

543
00:56:57,451 --> 00:57:00,746
你知道，如果我要走，他肯定搞个聚会就把我送走了
I mean, you know, me on the other hand.I would...I would throw a party.

544
00:57:09,948 --> 00:57:12,230
老天，你已经神志不清了
My god, you get delirious.

545
00:57:18,445 --> 00:57:20,173
我们离幸存者的所在坐标还有多远
How far are we from the coordinates from that call?

546
00:57:20,502 --> 00:57:21,917
还有挺长一段路要走
Still a way, sir.

547
00:57:22,877 --> 00:57:24,049
船长
Captain?

548
00:57:24,795 --> 00:57:27,015
你什么时候开始怀疑她的
When did you begin to suspect her?

549
00:57:29,114 --> 00:57:30,575
我怀疑的还不够早
Not soon enough.

550
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:32,547
你怎么会突然怀疑她？
How did you know?

551
00:57:34,741 --> 00:57:38,683
也许是因为我嗅觉敏锐，能预知到危险吧
I guess you can say I got gut knows for danger.

552
00:57:42,073 --> 00:57:43,546
快跑！
Run!

553
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:54,502
音乐？
Is that music?

554
00:57:54,562 --> 00:57:56,197
这音乐从哪里放出来的？
Where the hell is that coming from?

555
00:57:57,372 --> 00:57:58,624
那儿呢
There.

556
00:58:00,134 --> 00:58:03,620
我把那个小盒子接到电源上，那个小口子就开始唱歌了
I found a middle box in the power cell and delivering mouth like it sing.

557
00:58:04,579 --> 00:58:05,802
你真机智
That's very clever.

558
00:58:06,351 --> 00:58:08,019
我觉得这音乐虽然比较老土
Music is a bit old fashion for my taste...

559
00:58:08,054 --> 00:58:09,626
又吵，容易让人分心
...not to mention very loud and distracting...

560
00:58:09,661 --> 00:58:11,186
但总的来说还是不错的
...but hey, well played.

561
00:58:12,669 --> 00:58:14,419
我喜欢那节奏和呐喊
I like the beats and shouting.

562
00:58:14,444 --> 00:58:15,302
是么？
Well you do.

563
00:58:20,376 --> 00:58:21,679
- 把它关掉 - 没事的
- Switch it off. - Ah, it's okay.

564
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:22,637
快点关掉
Switch it off!

565
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:27,960
有人踩了我的陷阱
Someone set the foot on my traps.

566
00:58:52,022 --> 00:58:53,271
船长？
Captain?

567
00:58:53,615 --> 00:58:55,511
- 你认识他们？ - 是的，美女
- You know these men? - Ay, Lassie.

568
00:58:55,512 --> 00:58:57,803
这位是帕维尔 契科夫
That's <i>wemanel</i>  is Pavel Chekov...

569
00:58:58,224 --> 00:59:00,543
那位帅哥是詹姆斯 T.柯克
And that handsome bastard is James T. Kirk.

570
00:59:00,862 --> 00:59:02,018
他们是我的朋友
They are my mates.

571
00:59:02,396 --> 00:59:03,564
能见到你们真好
It's good to see you sir.

572
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:06,798
斯科特，她在干嘛
What is she doing Scotty?

573
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:08,749
别伤害他们
...don't hurt them because...

574
00:59:12,455 --> 00:59:14,179
你自由了，詹姆斯 T.
You're free, James T.

575
00:59:16,007 --> 00:59:17,364
斯科特先生
Mr. Scott.

576
00:59:22,752 --> 00:59:24,211
这位新朋友是谁？
Who's your new friend here?

577
00:59:24,953 --> 00:59:27,781
- 真是红毯欢迎真是够隆重的- 这位是婕拉
- She should have throw out the welcome mat. - This is Jaylah.

578
00:59:27,806 --> 00:59:29,653
我不知道你所说的红毯是什么东西
I do not know what is a welcome mat.

579
00:59:30,213 --> 00:59:31,775
- 你找到其他人了吗？ - 没有，长官
- You found anyone else? - No, sir.

580
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,325
我很抱歉，就剩下我们几个了
I'm sorry. You are the only ones.

581
00:59:34,357 --> 00:59:36,450
到底是怎么回事？为什么他们攻击我们？
What the hell happened up there, Jim?Why were we attacked?

582
00:59:36,612 --> 00:59:38,879
他们在找我们从提纳兹星上带回来的手工品
They were after the artifact we brought back from Teenax.

583
00:59:38,976 --> 00:59:39,911
- 他们拿到了么？ - 没
- Did they get it? - No.

584
00:59:39,988 --> 00:59:41,385
- 你拿到了么？ - 没
- Have you got it? - No.

585
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:43,068
我还在进取号上的时候，我把它藏在了一个逃生舱里
It did get off the Enterprise when it was in the shuttle.

586
00:59:43,252 --> 00:59:45,287
- 所以它在一个逃生舱里？ - 可以说在
- You hid it in a shuttle. - Yes.

587
00:59:45,958 --> 00:59:47,261
也可以说不在
And no.

588
01:00:01,253 --> 01:00:04,524
长官，这是富兰克林号星舰，是不是难以置信？
This is the USS Franklin, sir.Can you believe it?

589
01:00:04,738 --> 01:00:07,073
第一艘能加速到曲速4的星舰
The first Earth ship capable of warp 4.

590
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:09,951
2160年在加加林辐射带消失
Lost in Gagarin radiation belt in 2160.

591
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:13,203
我在星舰学院学到过这艘飞船，船长是巴尔萨泽 爱迪生
I remember that from the Academy.Captain Balthazar Edison.

592
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:16,783
那是星际舰队成立的第一年，他的船怎么会跑到这？
It was his first year in Starfleet.How the hell did the ship end up here?

593
01:00:16,964 --> 01:00:18,293
有很多种说法，长官
There is a lot of theories, sir.

594
01:00:18,418 --> 01:00:19,688
有的说是被罗慕伦人抓走了
Surrended to the Romulans,

595
01:00:19,836 --> 01:00:21,774
有的说是在太空中被一只绿色的巨手抓住了
Captured by a giant green space hand.

596
01:00:21,922 --> 01:00:24,021
就我所认为的，它可能是通过虫洞传送到这来的
This farrer, must be a wormhole displacement.

597
01:00:24,145 --> 01:00:25,152
你能发动这艘船吗？
Can she fly ?

598
01:00:25,441 --> 01:00:28,622
飞船还缺几个驱动核心，电磁燃料也不够，长官
She is missing a few drive decoyls and EPS conduits are fried...

599
01:00:28,647 --> 01:00:32,125
但是婕拉做了一些出色的修复工作，飞船系统重新上线了
but Jaylah has done a marvelous job getting the ship systems back online.

600
01:00:32,776 --> 01:00:34,589
谢谢夸奖，蒙哥马利 斯考提
Thank you, Montgomery Scotty.

601
01:00:37,326 --> 01:00:39,495
契科夫先生，你能不能利用船上的传感器
Mr. Chekov, Can you plug in the coordinates...

602
01:00:39,605 --> 01:00:41,854
确认一下那个坐标附近幸存船员的位置？
...see if we can track the crews location from the ship's sensors?

603
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,146
是，长官
Ay, Captain.

604
01:00:43,217 --> 01:00:44,291
他喜欢那个位置
He likes that seat.

605
01:00:44,302 --> 01:00:45,838
斯科特先生，跟我四处看看
Mr. Scott, tour.

606
01:00:45,891 --> 01:00:47,837
是，婕拉，我们走
Yes. The mess hall. Jaylah, get up.

607
01:00:48,021 --> 01:00:49,229
好的
Yes.

608
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:13,226
我们到现在都不知道这些船员的下落吧？
No clue what happend to the crew, right?

609
01:01:13,475 --> 01:01:15,829
是的，长官，他们已经死了有一个世纪了
No, sir. They would be dead 100 years by now.

610
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:21,589
那不是...
Is that...?

611
01:01:22,094 --> 01:01:23,783
那是一台PX-70摩托车啊
That's a PX-70.

612
01:01:28,532 --> 01:01:31,485
在我小的时候我爸爸就有一辆这样的摩托车
My dad used to have one when I was a kid.

613
01:01:31,989 --> 01:01:35,309
我妈妈说他总会让她坐在后座然后就像疯子一样开始飙车
Mom saying back there it was driving her nuts.

614
01:01:38,783 --> 01:01:39,415
长官
Sir.

615
01:01:43,911 --> 01:01:46,707
婕拉说这个飞船一直在这，难道
If you tell me this things has been here this whole time and ...

616
01:01:46,732 --> 01:01:48,372
其他人就看不到吗？
...no one has ever noticed it?

617
01:01:59,022 --> 01:02:01,298
她在这个飞船上安装了图像折射器
She stand out the image reflectors.

618
01:02:03,621 --> 01:02:07,417
- 就是所谓的全息伪装吧 - 是的，长官
-Alright, some sort of holographic camouflage. - Ay, sir.

619
01:02:10,317 --> 01:02:11,102
长官
Captain!

620
01:02:11,342 --> 01:02:14,315
我在星际舰队通信频道上
I intercepted a weak communication transmission, sir,

621
01:02:14,416 --> 01:02:16,281
拦截到了一个微弱的求救信号
It's a Starfleet frequency.

622
01:02:17,076 --> 01:02:19,076
<i>传输检测</i>
<i>TRANSMISSION DETECTED</i>

623
01:02:19,101 --> 01:02:20,418
你能锁定信号发射的位置吗？
You can locate the signal?

624
01:02:21,107 --> 01:02:23,264
可以，问题是我们要怎么去那里？
Yes, but how do we get to them?

625
01:02:24,397 --> 01:02:27,537
长官，我有个想法，但是需要先征询您的意见
I have an idea, sir,but I'm gonna need your permission.

626
01:02:27,891 --> 01:02:29,248
为什么一定需要我的批准
Why would you need my permission?

627
01:02:29,273 --> 01:02:30,680
如果我搞砸的话
Because if I mess up,

628
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:32,242
我不想一个人背锅
I don't want it to be just my fault.

629
01:02:35,506 --> 01:02:38,444
麦考伊和史波克呼叫进取号船员，收到请回答
McCoy and Spock Enteprise crew.Come in, Enterprise crew.

630
01:02:39,445 --> 01:02:40,445
有人吗
Anyone.

631
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:46,665
撑住，史波克
Come on, Spock.

632
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:49,002
加油，你能做到的
Come on, we can make it.

633
01:02:50,837 --> 01:02:55,070
医生，把我抛下能显著增加你的幸存几率
Leaving me behind will significantly increase your chances of survival, doctor.

634
01:02:55,095 --> 01:02:57,194
这还要你说，但我决不会这么干的
Well, I stand sure that is completly out of question.

635
01:02:57,295 --> 01:03:00,954
你现在的当务之急是找到其他幸存的船员
It is imperative that you locate any surviving crew.

636
01:03:00,979 --> 01:03:02,759
我还以为你从来都不在乎我的死活呢
No, I am sticking with you, i don't care.

637
01:03:10,526 --> 01:03:11,678
我当然在乎你，老骨头
Of course I care about...

638
01:03:14,735 --> 01:03:17,358
我一直认为我对你的尊敬天地可鉴
I always assumed my respect for you is clear.

639
01:03:20,276 --> 01:03:22,471
我们之间这么多年的谈话历历在目...
Dialogue we have had across the years...

640
01:03:22,472 --> 01:03:26,285
别说了，史波克
It's okay, Spock.You don't have to say it.

641
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:32,240
至少我不会一个人孤零零的死去
Well, at least I won't die alone.

642
01:03:39,015 --> 01:03:40,602
妈的这就是他的作风
Well, that's just typical.

643
01:03:44,828 --> 01:03:46,072
王八蛋们，我跟你们拼了...
Come on...

644
01:03:54,595 --> 01:03:56,354
医生，看到你没被大卸八块我很高兴
Good to see you in one piece doctor!

645
01:03:56,379 --> 01:03:57,246
我在哪呢
Oh, am I?

646
01:03:58,012 --> 01:03:59,814
我感觉我的肠子像被人扭过一般
I feel like my entrails were at barn days.

647
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:02,236
这些老式的传送机以前是用来运货的
I released old transporters were only ever used for cargo

648
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:04,208
我做了一些小调整，现在能传送人了
but a few modifications seems to do the trick.

649
01:04:04,233 --> 01:04:06,128
但是我觉得最好还是一次传送一个人
I thought it was best to bim you one at a time

650
01:04:06,153 --> 01:04:08,015
要不然传送的时候把你们俩绞在一起就不好了
You know, in case you got displaced.

651
01:04:09,884 --> 01:04:11,520
我已经没法想象比这更糟糕的情况了
Oh, I couldn't imagine a worse scenario.

652
01:04:12,255 --> 01:04:13,665
你能安全回来真好，没事吧？
Good to have you back.You all right?

653
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,056
我没事，他受伤了
Yeah, I'm fine. He's hurt.

654
01:04:15,091 --> 01:04:16,529
船长，我身体很正常
I am functioning adequately, Captain.

655
01:04:16,699 --> 01:04:17,940
才不是这样
In a pigs eye, you are.

656
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:22,030
船长，我们发现那个失踪的文物似乎是来自于这个星球
Captain, we discovered that a stolen artifact appears to come from this planet.

657
01:04:22,552 --> 01:04:23,883
该死的，史波克！
Damn it, Spock!

658
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:26,903
- 这艘船上还有医疗设备吗 - 跟我来
- Are there any medical supplies on this thing ? - This way.

659
01:04:34,119 --> 01:04:35,625
躺下
Lay down, come on.

660
01:04:36,049 --> 01:04:37,049
这就对了
There you go.

661
01:04:39,849 --> 01:04:41,099
史波克，我们要怎么离开这个地方？
How are we gonna get out of this hole, Spock?

662
01:04:41,124 --> 01:04:41,946
我们没有
We got...

663
01:04:42,471 --> 01:04:43,914
正常运行的飞船，也没有足够的船员
...no ship, no crew.

664
01:04:43,939 --> 01:04:44,660
操作数据存储也不对
Not this ods..

665
01:04:44,761 --> 01:04:46,379
吉姆，我们就像以前那样
We will do what we have always done, Jim.

666
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:49,016
在不可能中寻找希望
We will find hope in the impossible.

667
01:04:49,041 --> 01:04:50,786
别急，先让你身体恢复再说
Let's get you patched up first, okay?

668
01:04:50,811 --> 01:04:51,482
船长
Captain.

669
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:54,131
你必须集中你的注意力帮助船员
You must focus your efforts on helping the crew.

670
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:56,069
史波克，这就是我要你安心养病的原因
That's why I need you around Spock.

671
01:04:59,498 --> 01:05:01,000
这些都是古代的玩意了
This thing is from dark ages.

672
01:05:02,312 --> 01:05:03,241
拿过来试试看吧
Closer.

673
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:08,020
我确定这是一台原生质修复仪
I am pretty sure this is protoplaser.

674
01:05:08,208 --> 01:05:11,129
能止住内出血，至少我希望如此
To stop the internal emergy. At least that's my hope.

675
01:05:11,293 --> 01:05:14,911
都到死神门前了，他还在引用
It's miserable that we have no other medicine but only hope.

676
01:05:15,755 --> 01:05:17,689
莎士比亚的名句
That quote is from Shakespeare.

677
01:05:21,402 --> 01:05:24,647
<i>航行日志，星历 2263.2</i>
<i>Captain's Log, Stardate 2263.2
</i>

678
01:05:27,691 --> 01:05:29,506
我们同那边的人失去了联系
We searched the wreckage.

679
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:31,530
但还是不知道船长在哪
He must have hidden it elsewhere.

680
01:05:35,343 --> 01:05:39,343
派我去完成任务吧
All we have is his crew, krall.

681
01:05:49,449 --> 01:05:51,407
告诉我那东西在哪
Tell me where it is.

682
01:05:51,604 --> 01:05:52,608
现在就告诉我！
Now!

683
01:05:53,396 --> 01:05:55,227
No!

684
01:05:56,551 --> 01:05:57,751
住手！
Stop!

685
01:05:59,585 --> 01:06:01,358
放他走，我就把你想要的东西给你
Let him go and, I will give what you want.

686
01:06:01,383 --> 01:06:02,910
不，希尔，别给他
No, Syl! Don't!

687
01:06:27,286 --> 01:06:28,770
中尉
Lieutenant.

688
01:06:28,805 --> 01:06:32,591
团结不是力量
Unity is not your strength,

689
01:06:35,296 --> 01:06:37,048
而是弱点
It is your weakness.

690
01:07:12,546 --> 01:07:15,130
我们要等到了解清楚以后再行动
We should wait until we are absolutely sure.

691
01:07:15,117 --> 01:07:17,523
不，我们现在就着手准备尽快出发把船员救回来
No, we have to get the crew back, now.

692
01:07:18,311 --> 01:07:21,025
既然契科夫已经找到了克劳基地的坐标，那我们就去
Chekov has the coordinates that can lead us to Krall's base, so we go.

693
01:07:21,026 --> 01:07:24,347
恕我直言，先生，你怎么知道那个外星女人和克劳通话的时候克劳就在他的基地里
With respect, sir, how do we know that Krall was at the base when she called.

694
01:07:24,448 --> 01:07:26,385
就算那时候他在基地里，我们也无法确定他是不是把船员关在他的基地里
And even if he was, we do not know if and the crew is with them.

695
01:07:26,386 --> 01:07:27,386
连他们是死是活我们都不知道
Or still alive.

696
01:07:27,487 --> 01:07:29,853
契科夫先生，你能根据这个公式
Mr. Chekov, Can you reconfigure the search parameters

697
01:07:29,854 --> 01:07:31,753
调整一下搜寻参数吗？
in order to compensate for this formula?

698
01:07:33,196 --> 01:07:35,798
可以，指挥官，但这个公式是什么意思？
Ay, Commander but, what is this forumla?

699
01:07:36,532 --> 01:07:39,330
我的想法是从瓦克雅入手，它是一种瓦肯星上的特殊矿石
It is vokaya, Mr. Chekov.A mineral unique to Vulcan

700
01:07:39,331 --> 01:07:40,831
能释放出低剂量的辐射射线
which emits a low-level radiation.

701
01:07:41,051 --> 01:07:43,872
那么我就把其它的能量辐射都过滤掉吧
I'll have to find if there are any energy emissions.

702
01:07:44,073 --> 01:07:47,050
史波克，你说的这个瓦肯矿石和我们这所讨论的问题有什么联系？
Spock, what the hell would a Vulcan mineral be doing way out here?

703
01:07:47,051 --> 01:07:48,051
你打算怎么做？
Where are you going with this?

704
01:07:48,052 --> 01:07:49,796
乌胡拉中尉戴着一个瓦克雅护身符
Lt. Uhura wears a vokaya amulet

705
01:07:49,797 --> 01:07:52,880
它是我送给她的礼物，代表着我对她的爱和尊重
which I presented to her as a token of my affection and respect.

706
01:07:53,388 --> 01:07:55,313
你送了一个有放射性的珠宝给你的女朋友？
You gave your girlfriend a radioactive jewelery?

707
01:07:55,454 --> 01:07:56,900
辐射剂量很低，对人无害，医生
The emissions is harmless, Doctor.

708
01:07:56,901 --> 01:07:59,235
但是它特殊的辐射信号让它极其容易被识别
But it's unique signature makes it very easy to identify.

709
01:07:59,901 --> 01:08:01,999
你在你女朋友身上装了一个追踪装置？
You gave your girlfriend a tracking device?

710
01:08:05,821 --> 01:08:07,571
那不是我的本意
That was not my intention.

711
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:10,750
还好你并不尊重我
I am glad he doesn't respect me.

712
01:08:22,516 --> 01:08:26,048
找到了一个非常微弱的瓦克雅信号
I am detecting a very trace of vokaya.

713
01:08:26,507 --> 01:08:30,095
这个坐标和之前从那个外星女人那里搞到的坐标相符吗，契科夫先生？
Does the location match the coordinates you acquired from Kalari, Mr. Chekov?

714
01:08:30,361 --> 01:08:31,576
长官，坐标相符
It is a match, sir.

715
01:08:31,553 --> 01:08:34,445
这表明乌胡拉中尉和其他船员现在
It's presence suggest that Lt. Uhura and thereby the rest of the crew

716
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:36,309
正被关在克劳的基地里
are being held at Krall's base of operation.

717
01:08:36,833 --> 01:08:37,883
你能把他们传送出来么
Can we beam them out?

718
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:41,052
不能，长官，那边有一些地理干扰
No, sir. There is some geological interference

719
01:08:41,077 --> 01:08:43,549
阻挡了传送信号
that is blocking transporter signal.

720
01:08:43,574 --> 01:08:46,403
那么我们只能去那边一趟，用最原始的方法把他们救出来了
Well I guess we are gonna have to go and break in the old fashion way.

721
01:08:46,428 --> 01:08:49,159
你们不能去那里
You can not go to this place.

722
01:08:50,097 --> 01:08:52,425
去那边的人都死了
Everyone who goes there, he kills.

723
01:08:53,866 --> 01:08:56,246
你去过那边？你亲眼看过？
You've been there? You've seen it?

724
01:08:56,564 --> 01:08:57,955
姑娘，怎么从来没听你提过？
Why did you say something, Lassie?

725
01:08:57,956 --> 01:09:00,295
因为我知道如果我说了，你们会让我带你们过去
Because I knew you will ask me to take you there.

726
01:09:02,478 --> 01:09:06,091
你们的朋友在那边，那他们死定了，就像我的家人一样
If your friends are there then they will die,just like my family.

727
01:09:06,385 --> 01:09:08,607
我绝不会回到那个死亡之地去
And I will not go back to that death place.

728
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:11,641
如果你能从基地里逃出来，那么你就能告诉我们怎么进去，怎么出来
If you escaped than you can show us the way in and the way out.

729
01:09:11,666 --> 01:09:12,384
不！
No!

730
01:09:12,409 --> 01:09:15,308
我们说好的可不是这样的 蒙哥马利 斯科特
This is not the deal we made, Montgomery Scotty.

731
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,391
如果你们执意要去 你们就自己去吧
If you choose to do this,you are on your own.

732
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:22,416
- 等等 - 让她走吧
- Wait, wait. - Let her go.

733
01:09:22,441 --> 01:09:24,741
船长，她也失去过亲人
She's lost people too, Captain.

734
01:09:33,538 --> 01:09:37,245
姑娘，我的朋友们被关在那边，我们可不能抛下他们啊
Wait, that's our friends out there Lassie,and we can not just leave them behind.

735
01:09:38,194 --> 01:09:40,724
我们真的很需要你的帮助
We could really use your help.

736
01:09:41,261 --> 01:09:43,444
你勇敢点就好
We just need you to be brave as all.

737
01:09:45,199 --> 01:09:47,240
我还被关在那边的时候
When we run in that place...

738
01:09:47,973 --> 01:09:49,991
克劳会时不时过来，带走一个人
... Krall will come in and take someone.

739
01:09:50,738 --> 01:09:54,201
当时的那些惨叫至今在我的耳边盘旋
There were screams, I can still hear them.

740
01:09:55,782 --> 01:09:57,556
我们再也不会见到被他带走的人
And we would not see that person again...

741
01:09:57,580 --> 01:09:59,580
我们也不知道谁会是下一个
... it did not know who would be next.

742
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:07,593
我的父亲策划了一次逃亡行动
My father planned an escape.

743
01:10:08,073 --> 01:10:09,843
但是被一个叫做
But we were seen by the...

744
01:10:09,926 --> 01:10:11,859
玛纳斯的人发现了
...by the one they call Manas.

745
01:10:15,011 --> 01:10:18,803
我的父亲和他扭打在一起，我有机会逃了出来
My father fought him so I could get out.

746
01:10:19,275 --> 01:10:21,088
他很勇敢
He was brave...

747
01:10:21,112 --> 01:10:23,112
却不幸惨死在玛纳斯手下
and Manas killed him.

748
01:10:24,919 --> 01:10:26,639
你们想要做的事是不可能完成的
What you want is impossible.

749
01:10:29,872 --> 01:10:31,620
也许我们能办到
Maybe it's not.

750
01:10:32,566 --> 01:10:36,020
我的奶奶以前说过，众人拾柴火焰高
Maybe granny used to say "you cannot break a stick in a bundle".

751
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:39,309
姑娘，你是一个大的集体中的一员
You're a part of something bigger now, Lassie.

752
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:41,718
在困境中
Don't give on that...

753
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:43,862
我们绝不会放弃你
Because we are sur as hell, we'll never give up on you...

754
01:10:44,195 --> 01:10:46,195
这也是我们团队一直以来的信念
That is what being part of crew is all about.

755
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,125
你也是这么想的么，詹姆斯 T.?
Is that what you believe in, James T.?

756
01:10:53,277 --> 01:10:55,953
我只知道，跟你在一起我们成功几率会更大
All I know is, we stand a better chance with you.

757
01:10:58,212 --> 01:11:01,266
这里有一条直通穴地的隧道
The diggind machines uncover the tunnel that goes into the crater

758
01:11:01,301 --> 01:11:02,405
我就是从那逃出来的
That's how we get out.

759
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,048
我们就从那边潜入基地
Also that'll be our way in?

760
01:11:04,195 --> 01:11:07,449
渗透小队在隧道的那一头待命
the away team will beam to the other side of the tunnel,follow it across to the base...

761
01:11:07,474 --> 01:11:09,390
然后潜入基地，攻入内部建筑，救出船员
...get inside the building and break out the crew.

762
01:11:09,417 --> 01:11:12,922
船长，我们无法锁定穴地里的任何人
Captain, we can not locate anyone inside the crater

763
01:11:12,957 --> 01:11:14,091
更别说把他们传送上来了
in order to beam them out.

764
01:11:14,126 --> 01:11:16,144
我会用信标增强信号
Or, I can bring up pulse beacons to path enhancers

765
01:11:16,179 --> 01:11:17,931
- 这样就能收到穴地内部的信号了 - 好的
- That I get signal into the crater. - Alright.

766
01:11:17,956 --> 01:11:19,947
富兰克林上的传送机一次能送上来多少人？
How many people can Franklin transport at the time?

767
01:11:19,972 --> 01:11:22,259
我做一点调校，一次最多20人
With a minor modifications,20 max...

768
01:11:22,284 --> 01:11:23,743
但是我不知道那老古董还能坚持多久
But I am not sure how long it will hold out.

769
01:11:24,245 --> 01:11:26,750
老骨头，契科夫先生和婕拉，你们组成渗透小队
Bones, Mr. Chekov and Jaylah,would be in the away team.

770
01:11:26,785 --> 01:11:28,682
斯科特先生，你负责修复传送仪
Mr Scott, modify the transporter

771
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:30,738
尽一切可能让它恢复正常
and do whatever you can to make this ship operational.

772
01:11:30,763 --> 01:11:32,746
船长，考虑到契科夫先生的技术才能
Ay captain, Mr. Chekov's technical acumen

773
01:11:32,781 --> 01:11:35,432
外勤过于危险，让他和斯科特先生一起待在富兰克林号比较合适
makes him more valuable onboard the Franklin with Mr. Scott.

774
01:11:35,566 --> 01:11:37,659
我代替他更符合逻辑
Is there by logical that I would replace him.

775
01:11:37,684 --> 01:11:40,516
胡说，史波克，你的伤刚刚好
Why is that logical Spock?You just got back on your feet.

776
01:11:40,976 --> 01:11:43,458
乌胡拉中尉还被关在那里呢，吉姆
Lt. Uhura's in that facillity, Jim.

777
01:11:46,327 --> 01:11:48,517
我会照顾好他的
I'll keep an eye on him.

778
01:11:48,824 --> 01:11:50,146
那行吧
Understood.

779
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:53,584
基地到处都有他的卫兵把守，我们三个人就这么进去肯定会被发现
His soldiers are everywhere.We won't pass unseen.

780
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:55,887
我们需要人去吸引他们的注意力
What we require is a diversion.

781
01:12:01,888 --> 01:12:03,886
我有个不错的想法
I think I have an idea.

782
01:12:28,582 --> 01:12:31,244
这就是安布罗纳斯
This is Abronath.

783
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:35,586
古人把它们当做一种武器
It was used by the ancient once as a weapon

784
01:12:35,956 --> 01:12:39,134
但是当他们发现自己无法驾驭它的力量的时候
But when they could not control its deadly power...

785
01:12:39,169 --> 01:12:42,078
就把它分成了两半
...they split it into two...

786
01:12:42,113 --> 01:12:45,144
把其中的核心部分扔到太空中
And rejected the halves into space.

787
01:12:45,179 --> 01:12:47,281
希望它会永远的消失
Hoping it will be lost forever.

788
01:12:51,132 --> 01:12:53,129
话说来我还得谢谢你们
But I am grateful

789
01:12:53,764 --> 01:12:57,851
我毕生都在寻找它
I have spent life times searching for

790
01:12:57,886 --> 01:13:02,467
而如今你们却替我找到了它
And only to have you find it for me.

791
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:09,029
真是命运无常啊
The poetry of fate.

792
01:13:11,849 --> 01:13:14,450
我出生的世界
The world that I was born into...

793
01:13:14,485 --> 01:13:17,468
和你们的不太一样，中尉
...is very different from yours, Lieutenant.

794
01:13:17,493 --> 01:13:20,226
我们能感受到痛苦和恐惧
We knew pain, we knew terror.

795
01:13:20,261 --> 01:13:23,689
正是斗争让我们更加强大
Struggle, made us strong.

796
01:13:23,724 --> 01:13:26,279
不是和平，也不是团结
Not peace, not unity.

797
01:13:26,304 --> 01:13:30,741
斗争是星联已经遗忘的强大力量
These are myths the Federation would had you believe.

798
01:13:34,965 --> 01:13:36,567
这些说法
Those are strong words.

799
01:13:36,791 --> 01:13:38,267
也许你自己深信不疑
You may even believe them.

800
01:13:38,268 --> 01:13:40,276
但我感觉到你身上肯定还有一些说不清的东西
But there's something else
going on with you.

801
01:13:40,706 --> 01:13:42,124
一些不为人知的东西
Something underneath.

802
01:13:46,022 --> 01:13:47,463
等等
Wait.

803
01:13:47,848 --> 01:13:49,228
你要干什么？
What are you doing with her?

804
01:13:50,452 --> 01:13:53,002
你已经拿到了你想要的东西了，放她走
You already got what you want then Let her go!

805
01:13:53,494 --> 01:13:54,799
不！
No!

806
01:14:30,397 --> 01:14:31,455
玛纳斯
Manas.

807
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:33,679
玛纳斯
It's time.

808
01:14:35,242 --> 01:14:38,848
星联已经向外扩张了几个世纪了
The Federation has pushed the frontier for centuries.

809
01:14:38,883 --> 01:14:40,259
我们会让他们就此停下扩张的脚步
But no longer.

810
01:14:40,832 --> 01:14:43,062
中尉，这是我们斗争的开端
This is where it begins, Lieutenant.

811
01:14:46,289 --> 01:14:49,939
这就是边境区域反击星联的开端
This is where the frontier,pushes back.

812
01:15:03,085 --> 01:15:04,366
跟我来
This way.

813
01:15:21,268 --> 01:15:22,860
她在哪？
Where is she?

814
01:15:43,277 --> 01:15:45,636
这确实分散了他们不少注意力
I got to admit, that's a hell of a distraction.

815
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:48,328
你们的朋友被关在那边
Your friends are over there.

816
01:15:51,322 --> 01:15:52,509
跟我来
Come on.

817
01:15:54,570 --> 01:15:55,573
这里交给我
Let me deal with them.

818
01:15:56,292 --> 01:15:57,794
你把这个带走
You've brought us this far.

819
01:15:58,286 --> 01:16:00,372
完成我们的使命，克劳
Finish the mission, krall.

820
01:16:07,329 --> 01:16:08,329
走
Go!

821
01:16:41,658 --> 01:16:44,153
指挥官，乌胡拉被他们抓走了
Commander, Uhura they took her.

822
01:16:46,919 --> 01:16:48,916
把船员带到安全的地方
Get ready and take the crew to safety.

823
01:16:49,734 --> 01:16:51,180
快，我们走，跟上
Come on. Let's go. Move.

824
01:16:59,017 --> 01:17:00,835
- 收到信号了，斯科特先生 - 好的，契科夫先生
- I've got them, Mr Scott. - Okay, Mr. Chekov.

825
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:03,189
分析信号，我们一次要传20人上来
Increase the signal.We are gonna grab them 20 at a time.

826
01:17:03,214 --> 01:17:05,163
- 明白 - 希望我们不会搞砸
- Ay. - Let's hope this doesn't get messy.

827
01:17:05,188 --> 01:17:06,511
传送仪充能
Energize!

828
01:17:41,831 --> 01:17:42,913
史波克！
Spock!

829
01:17:43,437 --> 01:17:45,437
你怎么会在这？
What are you doing here?

830
01:17:46,354 --> 01:17:49,505
很明显，我是来救你的
Clearly,I am here to rescue you.

831
01:17:50,087 --> 01:17:51,314
我们走
Let's go.

832
01:17:59,258 --> 01:18:00,525
很高兴见到你，朋友
Good to see you, good man.

833
01:18:27,267 --> 01:18:30,994
你会像你的父亲一样死在这的
You'll die here as your father.

834
01:19:22,241 --> 01:19:24,387
医生，10秒钟后传送仪充能完成
Ten seconds until transporters recharged, doctor.

835
01:19:24,488 --> 01:19:25,695
等我信号
Wait for my signal.

836
01:19:25,696 --> 01:19:27,781
- 医生，不能再拖了 - 乌胡拉还没来我们不能走
- Doctor! - Damn it man, we are not leaving without them!

837
01:19:31,163 --> 01:19:31,767
快，我们走
Come on! Let's go!

838
01:19:31,791 --> 01:19:32,591
快走
Move! move!

839
01:20:00,179 --> 01:20:02,497
我们已经准备就绪了，船长，把你的信标打开
We are ready for an extract,just turn on your beacon.

840
01:20:02,932 --> 01:20:04,649
- 斯科特，所有人都接到了吗？ - 是的，长官
- Scotty, you have everybody? - Ay, sir.

841
01:20:04,674 --> 01:20:05,844
除了你和婕拉都回来了
Everyones here except you and Jeylah.

842
01:20:05,869 --> 01:20:07,730
打开信标，我们就把你传送回来
Start the beacon and we will grab ya.

843
01:20:16,474 --> 01:20:20,208
你的朋友会把你扔在这的
They will leave you here.

844
01:20:23,104 --> 01:20:24,323
船长，快打开信标
Captain, your beacon!

845
01:20:55,314 --> 01:20:56,661
- 收到信号了 - 传送仪充能
- There it is! - Energize!

846
01:21:00,043 --> 01:21:02,031
婕拉！
Jaylah!

847
01:21:15,397 --> 01:21:18,344
再也别这么干了
Okay, let's never do that again.

848
01:21:18,931 --> 01:21:20,388
我同意 詹姆斯 T.
I agree, James T.

849
01:21:24,199 --> 01:21:24,699
你们还好吗？
You all right?

850
01:21:25,109 --> 01:21:27,228
船长，他搞到的这个东西...
Captain this thing he has...

851
01:21:27,253 --> 01:21:30,535
约克镇，他计划袭击约克镇
Yorktown. He is gonna destroy the Yorktown.

852
01:21:32,349 --> 01:21:34,046
你们把我的房子拿去
You take my house...

853
01:21:34,708 --> 01:21:37,118
把它开走
...and you make it fly.

854
01:21:40,103 --> 01:21:41,628
斯科特，你能发动飞船吗？
Mr. Scotty, can you get this thing started?

855
01:21:41,729 --> 01:21:44,165
你说什么？发动它？这个好说，但是让他飞起来，就是另外一码事了
Well start it, yes.Flying sir, that's a different thing.

856
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:45,767
这些老式的飞船是在太空建造的
These old vessel, they were built in space.

857
01:21:45,792 --> 01:21:47,976
制造者们根本没打算让它们在大气层内起飞
They were never supposed to take off from the atmosphere.

858
01:21:48,001 --> 01:21:49,433
不管怎么说我们得让它飞起来
Make it happen.

859
01:21:49,458 --> 01:21:51,641
船长，它们被称作“星际飞船”是有原因的
They are called Starships sir,for a reason.

860
01:21:51,666 --> 01:21:52,678
你为什么现在才跟我说？
You tell me this now?

861
01:21:52,713 --> 01:21:56,071
我不想那么早告诉你，让你失望，万一你这次回不来怎么办
Because I didn't want to disappoint ya.You know, in case we didn't make it back.

862
01:21:56,416 --> 01:21:57,850
斯科特先生，你可真是贴心啊
How thoughtful, Mr. Scott.

863
01:21:57,851 --> 01:21:58,851
船长
Captain.

864
01:22:05,669 --> 01:22:06,863
他已经起飞了
He is launching.

865
01:22:13,698 --> 01:22:16,182
对约克镇的袭击说不定只是个开始
The attack at the Yorktown may be just the beginning.

866
01:22:16,717 --> 01:22:18,120
用这种生物武器
With this bioweapon...

867
01:22:18,121 --> 01:22:19,499
他可以杀死上面的所有人
...he could get rid of all life...

868
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:21,103
再利用基地里的先进科学技术
...and use the bases advanced technology...

869
01:22:21,104 --> 01:22:23,494
来袭击各个星际联盟行星
...to attack an untold number of Federation planets.

870
01:22:25,743 --> 01:22:28,039
我们得把这玩意开上天
We are just gonna have to get this thing flying.

871
01:22:28,074 --> 01:22:30,098
长官，这可不仅仅是强制启动它那么简单的事
We can not just jump start it, sir.

872
01:22:35,457 --> 01:22:37,333
所有系统已启动
Okay, all systems online.

873
01:22:37,358 --> 01:22:40,982
锂反应炉充能70%，可用性正在增加
Dilithium chambers at 70% and raising.

874
01:22:41,007 --> 01:22:43,943
次级引擎已准备完毕
Primary subwarp engines standing by.

875
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:47,235
苏鲁先生
Mr. Sulu.

876
01:22:47,285 --> 01:22:48,520
你能
You can...

877
01:22:48,544 --> 01:22:49,623
让这东西
You know...

878
01:22:49,648 --> 01:22:51,768
起飞的，对吧？
...fly this thing, right?

879
01:22:52,471 --> 01:22:53,587
当然，你是在逗我么，先生？
You kidding me, sir?

880
01:22:54,065 --> 01:22:55,626
太棒了
Fantastic.

881
01:22:56,007 --> 01:22:57,651
斯科特，你那边怎么样？
Scotty, how are we looking?

882
01:22:58,378 --> 01:22:59,965
长官，已经准备就绪
Ready as she will never be, sir.

883
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,577
就喜欢听你说这个，很好
That's what I like to hear.Alright.

884
01:23:01,612 --> 01:23:03,303
老骨头，救回来的船员们怎么样了
Bones, where are we with the crew?

885
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:04,480
这边有个医疗舱还能用
I could use a functioning med bay,

886
01:23:04,505 --> 01:23:06,357
大部分人身体状况良好
but otherwise we are secure down here.

887
01:23:06,684 --> 01:23:08,201
苏鲁先生
Mr. Sulu.

888
01:23:08,236 --> 01:23:10,283
我们要将飞船开到最大临界速度
We have to achieve a terminal velocity,

889
01:23:10,284 --> 01:23:12,756
稳定器才能成功托起飞船
in order for the stabilizers to provide lift.

890
01:23:13,047 --> 01:23:15,564
你确定这台老式的推进器能办到吗？
Are you sure this drop is high enough to do that?

891
01:23:17,105 --> 01:23:18,593
我们待会就知道了
We'll find out.

892
01:23:27,213 --> 01:23:29,163
准备起飞吧，苏鲁先生
Call it, Mr. Sulu.

893
01:23:29,198 --> 01:23:30,372
是，长官
Ay ay, Captain.

894
01:23:31,004 --> 01:23:33,089
契科夫先生，听我口令准备启动稳定器
Mr. Chekov, be ready to hit the forward stabilizers

895
01:23:33,124 --> 01:23:34,868
使用四分之一推力
full on my mark. One quarter impulse.

896
01:23:34,893 --> 01:23:35,782
好
Right.

897
01:23:57,535 --> 01:24:00,163
- 使用二分之一推力 - 明白
- One half impulse, Mr. Chekov. - Ay.

898
01:24:02,419 --> 01:24:03,806
我们要系上安全带了，快走
We should belt up. Come on, move move!

899
01:24:13,712 --> 01:24:15,744
稳点，苏鲁先生，别把飞船撞碎了
Easy, Mr. Sulu.Let's not break her now.

900
01:24:51,297 --> 01:24:53,880
快使用全推力，苏鲁先生
Anytime, Mr. Sulu.

901
01:24:58,828 --> 01:25:00,125
全推力，契科夫先生
Now, Mr. Chekov.

902
01:26:12,519 --> 01:26:14,439
警报，不明舰艇正在靠近中
I have an alert on incoming vessel.

903
01:26:15,506 --> 01:26:18,322
全频率未收到身份验证请求
No reply on all frequency ID request.

904
01:26:18,323 --> 01:26:19,523
投到屏幕上来
Visual.

905
01:26:32,997 --> 01:26:34,693
启动红色警报！
Red alert! Red alert!

906
01:26:45,195 --> 01:26:47,735
看看他们发展的有多先进
Look how far they've come.

907
01:26:50,759 --> 01:26:52,759
<i>请注意警报</i>
<i>*Some kind of alert*</i>

908
01:27:01,386 --> 01:27:04,871
在各个频段上均收到了来自约克镇的求救信号
I'm picking up distress signals from every frequency coming from Yorktown.

909
01:27:06,706 --> 01:27:07,975
克劳已经开始进攻了
Krall is already starting the attack.

910
01:27:08,661 --> 01:27:10,580
斯科特，我们装备有哪些武器？
Mr. Scott, what kind of weapons do we have?

911
01:27:11,103 --> 01:27:14,786
我们有相位脉冲炮和太空鱼雷
We have pulse phased cannons and spatial torpedoes.

912
01:27:14,821 --> 01:27:15,997
很好，马上开火
Great. Lock and load.

913
01:27:16,022 --> 01:27:18,585
这些武器对蜂群没用
That does not matter.You can no defeat the bees.

914
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:20,878
能暂时吸引他们注意力就行
Maybe, maybe we will lore them away.

915
01:27:20,905 --> 01:27:23,601
我们得给约克镇上的人争取时间让他们躲到安全地带
How do we get Yorktown time to get people to safety?

916
01:27:23,636 --> 01:27:25,456
我们的飞船太老了
We are on course and buggy competitors.

917
01:27:25,491 --> 01:27:27,487
就这么冲进去我们自己也得粉身碎骨，船长
We are barely holding together as it is, Captain.

918
01:27:27,512 --> 01:27:28,214
船长
Captain.

919
01:27:28,239 --> 01:27:31,270
蜂群的飞行模式应该是由一位个体决定的
The flight paterns of bees are determined by individual decisions.

920
01:27:31,295 --> 01:27:33,648
克劳的飞行器队形过于复杂
Krall's form formations are to complex...

921
01:27:33,683 --> 01:27:36,771
如果不依赖某种形式的群体子网路算法就无法正常行动
...not to rely on some form of unified cyberpathic coordination.

922
01:27:36,796 --> 01:27:38,175
- 所以我推断... - 史波克
- Assuming that we could be... - Spock.

923
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:39,131
直接告诉我结论就好
Skip to the end.

924
01:27:39,156 --> 01:27:41,140
他想说的是，如果我们能让蜂群自乱阵脚
What he is saying that if we disorient the swarm...

925
01:27:41,141 --> 01:27:42,309
就能击溃他们了
...we can kick it's ass.

926
01:27:43,324 --> 01:27:44,436
我就这个意思
Precisely.

927
01:27:45,611 --> 01:27:47,590
斯科特，你能不能把我传送到其中一架飞行器上去？
Scotty, can you beam me onto one of those swarm ships?

928
01:27:47,591 --> 01:27:49,007
你这是疯了么？
Have you gone completly mad?

929
01:27:49,008 --> 01:27:50,483
- 行还是不行？ - 不行
- Yes or no? - No.

930
01:27:50,532 --> 01:27:51,375
行
Yes.

931
01:27:51,599 --> 01:27:52,443
也许可以吧
Maybe.

932
01:27:52,444 --> 01:27:56,372
船长，我熟悉这种飞行器的内部构造，这使得我
Captain, my familiarity with the interior of those ships, however brave

933
01:27:56,407 --> 01:27:58,479
更加适合参加这次行动
makes me more qualified for this away mission.

934
01:27:58,504 --> 01:28:00,281
史波克，你的伤还没好
Spock, you're still hurt.

935
01:28:00,629 --> 01:28:02,227
史波克，她说的对
She's right, Spock.

936
01:28:03,574 --> 01:28:05,581
我很感激你们对我的关心
I acknowledge and respect your concerns.

937
01:28:06,561 --> 01:28:09,102
也许让一个对我的伤情和敌机都十分了解的人和我
Perhaps you will feel more confident if I were accompanied by someone

938
01:28:09,103 --> 01:28:12,326
一起去你们会更加放心
with familiarity of both the ship and my injury.

939
01:28:13,613 --> 01:28:15,213
他肯定很愿意跟你一起去
He is gonna love this.

940
01:28:17,059 --> 01:28:18,283
你要我干什么来着？
You want me to do what?

941
01:28:19,364 --> 01:28:20,535
快来吧，医生
Come along, doctor.

942
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:21,854
等等
Whoo, wait a minute.

943
01:28:21,996 --> 01:28:25,107
你这个留着绿血，忘恩负义的混蛋，这都是你的馊主意
Why you green-blooded ingrain This was your idea.

944
01:28:25,738 --> 01:28:26,852
老骨头，他这个主意还不错
It's a good idea, Bones.

945
01:28:26,921 --> 01:28:29,639
下次如果有个管子扎到你腹部里了
You know, next time you have piece of pipes stuck in your trousers...

946
01:28:29,939 --> 01:28:30,970
你就叫管道工帮你拔出来吧
...call a plumber.

947
01:28:31,065 --> 01:28:32,917
一定要找到干扰他们队形的方式
Let's make sure you find a way to break these things.

948
01:28:32,918 --> 01:28:35,002
如果你们遇上了什么麻烦，我就直接把你们传送回来
If it gets heady I'll beam ya straight back.

949
01:28:35,003 --> 01:28:36,003
传送仪充能
Energize.

950
01:28:36,527 --> 01:28:38,127
肯定会没事的
It will be great!

951
01:28:38,357 --> 01:28:40,408
真该死，吉姆，我只是个医生，不是...
Damn it, Jim.I'm a doctor, not...

952
01:28:47,642 --> 01:28:50,614
你难道不记得上次我开这玩意的时候
You do realize *something something*these things

953
01:28:50,849 --> 01:28:51,879
我们坠机了？
we crash.

954
01:28:52,348 --> 01:28:54,420
所以出了啥事别怪我...
*something*

955
01:28:59,083 --> 01:29:00,547
我们撞到了什么
Hit something.

956
01:29:00,648 --> 01:29:01,648
史波克呼叫富兰克林号
Spock by Franklin.

957
01:29:01,875 --> 01:29:03,056
收到，史波克
Spock, we read you.

958
01:29:03,057 --> 01:29:06,297
船长，就目前来看，敌机之间的确是用一种子网络语言
Captain, from what I can intricate, these ships do with the shared cyberpathic language...

959
01:29:06,298 --> 01:29:07,724
相互沟通，协调行动的
...that coordinates their actions.

960
01:29:07,888 --> 01:29:09,120
具体信息发给你了
Patching through now.

961
01:29:09,980 --> 01:29:11,651
这就是那个信号
That's what they signalize.

962
01:29:13,061 --> 01:29:15,436
原来他们不是在干扰我们，只是在相互沟通罢了
They weren't jamming us,they were talking to each other.

963
01:29:15,437 --> 01:29:17,579
怎么才能让它们闭嘴呢
How do we get them to stop talking?

964
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:19,375
用电磁聚焦干扰怎么样？
What about an electromagnetic focusing?

965
01:29:19,376 --> 01:29:21,285
我们可以发射信号干扰他们的通信
We can use the transporters to disturb their network.

966
01:29:21,286 --> 01:29:22,576
干扰不一定要针对某个个体
Focus might be too specific.

967
01:29:22,903 --> 01:29:25,663
如果我们能发送干扰信号扰乱蜂群的内部通讯
If you can plant some sort of disruptive communication signal inside the swarm

968
01:29:25,664 --> 01:29:27,874
他们就无法相互沟通、协调，进而自乱阵脚
it might inversely effect capacity the way it coordinates.

969
01:29:28,175 --> 01:29:30,936
这个干扰信号要用一个他们设想不到的频段发射出去
It will have to be the frequency they will not anticipate.

970
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:33,622
它会在蜂群内部引发连锁反应，进而摧毁整个蜂群
It will cause a chain reaction that will wipe out the whole swarm.

971
01:29:33,623 --> 01:29:37,407
长官，这样一个密集的内部网络肯定对高频信号十分敏感
Sir, a closed network like that might be sensitible to very high frequency.

972
01:29:37,905 --> 01:29:39,418
甚高频信号
VHF.

973
01:29:39,573 --> 01:29:40,093
无线电
Radio.

974
01:29:40,117 --> 01:29:42,117
我们可以通过飞船上发送一些广播信号
We can...We can broadcast something from the ship

975
01:29:42,194 --> 01:29:43,194
来切断他们的通信网络
to wire out the links.

976
01:29:43,195 --> 01:29:44,515
我们要播放一些又吵又令人分心的东西
Something loud and distracting.

977
01:29:44,539 --> 01:29:46,039
又吵又令人分心？
Loud and distracting?

978
01:29:47,719 --> 01:29:49,346
我刚好手上有这样的东西
I've got just the thing.

979
01:29:49,547 --> 01:29:51,225
别把我的音乐播放器搞坏了
Do not break my music.

980
01:29:51,226 --> 01:29:53,591
搞坏它？放心，不会的
Break it?It will get an upgrade.

981
01:30:06,327 --> 01:30:08,321
60秒后他们就突进基地了
Swarm ships in 60 seconds will break in through.

982
01:30:08,722 --> 01:30:11,793
我要重新配置多相高频信号
I just got to reconfigure the VHF array range multiphasic suite.

983
01:30:12,148 --> 01:30:13,761
- 我来吧 - 别动，小姑娘
- Let me do it. - No, Lassie I am in a hurry.

984
01:30:13,762 --> 01:30:14,762
快点
Do it.

985
01:30:20,658 --> 01:30:21,378
看，就这样搞定了
There, see?

986
01:30:21,602 --> 01:30:22,602
真简单
Simple.

987
01:30:22,626 --> 01:30:23,494
好了
Alright.

988
01:30:23,495 --> 01:30:25,040
船长，我们可以开始发送广播信号了
Captain, we are ready to broadcast.

989
01:30:25,223 --> 01:30:27,605
这个信号传不太远，我们要把飞船开近一点
The signal won't travel far,we have to get closer.

990
01:30:27,835 --> 01:30:29,934
- 开的多近？ - 越近越好
- How close? - Very.

991
01:30:30,035 --> 01:30:31,586
规划拦截线路，苏鲁先生
Intercept course, Mr. Sulu.

992
01:30:32,456 --> 01:30:34,296
是，先生
- *something*

993
01:30:47,239 --> 01:30:48,982
我们的老朋友又来了
My old friend.

994
01:30:59,783 --> 01:31:03,726
长官，蜂群正在聚集，形成攻击队列中
Swarm ships are gathering back and forming an attack wave, sir.

995
01:31:03,751 --> 01:31:05,102
我们成功的吸引了他们的注意
I think we got their attention.

996
01:31:05,127 --> 01:31:06,333
稳住，苏鲁先生
Hold steady, Mr. Sulu.

997
01:31:06,534 --> 01:31:07,640
大家都打起精神来
Brace yourselves, everybody.

998
01:31:07,641 --> 01:31:09,422
史波克，准备随时离开敌机编队
Spock, stand by to drop out of formation.

999
01:31:09,423 --> 01:31:11,415
- 斯科特，你那边准备好了么 - 准备好了，长官
- Scotty, all queued up back there? - Ay, sir.

1000
01:31:11,416 --> 01:31:14,043
广播频率57.7兆赫兹
Ready to broadcast at 57.7 MHz.

1001
01:31:14,044 --> 01:31:16,506
- 姑娘，待会由你负责打开音乐 - 我就喜欢这种节奏和呐喊
- Made your choice, Lassie? - I have the beat and shouting.

1002
01:31:40,588 --> 01:31:42,439
让我们来制造点噪音吧
Let's make some noise.

1003
01:31:50,309 --> 01:31:51,671
这歌选的不错
That's a good choice.

1004
01:32:04,903 --> 01:32:06,462
开快点，医生，要不然我们会
Faster, Doc. We risk to be consumed

1005
01:32:06,497 --> 01:32:07,979
被它们的无规则移动撞到的
by the trajectorial defects.

1006
01:32:08,166 --> 01:32:09,661
你这个多嘴的后座乘客
Impact seat fibers.

1007
01:32:10,132 --> 01:32:12,739
- 小心点，医生 - 我知道
- Get ready, Doctor! - God damn, I see it!

1008
01:32:32,166 --> 01:32:34,031
他们在放古典音乐？
Is that classical music?

1009
01:32:35,326 --> 01:32:37,269
看起来的确如此，医生
Yes, Doctor.It'd seems to be.

1010
01:32:37,709 --> 01:32:41,186
乌胡拉中尉，让约克镇也用同样的频率广播
Lt. Uhura, make sure Yorktown has the frequency to broadcast.

1011
01:32:43,889 --> 01:32:45,818
长官，我们刚刚收到一条关于干扰敌机通信频率的情报
Sir, we now have the distraction frequency.

1012
01:32:46,239 --> 01:32:47,584
用该频率进行广播！
Broadcast!

1013
01:33:08,345 --> 01:33:09,768
你那边没事吧，史波克？
You're all right, Spock?

1014
01:33:09,769 --> 01:33:10,893
我们这边一切正常，船长
We are fine, Captain.

1015
01:33:10,917 --> 01:33:12,917
但是用三艘敌机已经突进了约克镇
But there are still three ships heading into Yorktown.

1016
01:33:12,994 --> 01:33:13,994
那肯定是克劳的座机
That's got to be Krall.

1017
01:33:13,995 --> 01:33:15,045
史波克，盯紧他们
Keep on him, Spock.

1018
01:33:15,069 --> 01:33:17,869
不惜一切代价组织他们使用生物武器
Do whatever it takes to stop him from using that weapon.

1019
01:33:37,390 --> 01:33:39,504
我的房子要塌了
My house is breaking!

1020
01:33:39,505 --> 01:33:41,791
再这样下去船壳要解体了
Mass depolarization of hull plating.

1021
01:33:41,816 --> 01:33:45,199
也许我能通过锂反应炉改变能量，但我需要帮助
Maybe I can redirect the power,
from the dilithium chamber, but I need help.

1022
01:33:45,224 --> 01:33:47,335
来帮我一把，婕拉，跟我走
I need you, Jaylah.Let's go!

1023
01:34:13,033 --> 01:34:14,198
医生，开快点，别跟丢了
Do not lose them, Doctor.

1024
01:34:14,399 --> 01:34:16,772
再吵就你来开，史波克
We can always change places if you want, Spock.

1025
01:34:37,881 --> 01:34:41,387
船长，想同时拦截三艘船几乎是不可能的
Captain, intercepting all three ships is an impossibility.

1026
01:34:45,558 --> 01:34:47,476
把约克镇的布局图调出来
Give me schematic of Yorktown.

1027
01:34:48,645 --> 01:34:50,722
他们肯定要去那，约克镇总部
There. Yorktown headquarters.

1028
01:34:50,723 --> 01:34:53,209
契科夫先生，能对中央广场进行一次生物污染物扫描吗？
Mr. Chekov, can you do a bioscan on central plaza?

1029
01:34:53,399 --> 01:34:54,480
好
Ay.

1030
01:34:54,504 --> 01:34:56,273
他们正在疏散平民
They are clearing civilians.

1031
01:34:56,274 --> 01:34:58,172
老骨头，前面有一个城市广场
Bones, there's a city plaza coming up.

1032
01:34:58,173 --> 01:35:00,240
想点办法，务必让他们经过那边
You have to make sure Krall heads for it.

1033
01:35:00,550 --> 01:35:02,243
- 为啥？ - 照做就是了！
- Why? - Just do it!

1034
01:35:17,746 --> 01:35:19,298
苏鲁，把我们送上去
Sulu, get us up there!

1035
01:35:19,299 --> 01:35:20,785
大家抓紧了
Hold onto something!

1036
01:36:15,313 --> 01:36:17,672
- 干得好，二位 - 谢谢长官夸奖
- Great work, Bones. - Thanks, Captain.

1037
01:36:18,073 --> 01:36:20,407
我现在在想我该如何降落这玩意呢
Now I just need to figure out how to land.

1038
01:36:26,568 --> 01:36:29,318
船长，船体有三处破损
Captain, I have 3 hull breaches from the impact.

1039
01:36:29,519 --> 01:36:32,282
分别位于3号甲板，货物舱和引擎室
Deck 3, the cargo bay and the engine room.

1040
01:36:33,146 --> 01:36:35,789
苏鲁和契科夫，你们去货舱和3号甲板检查一下
Alright, Sulu, Chekov, check the cargo bay and deck 3.

1041
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:38,911
务必确保武器已经被销毁而且克劳也死了
I need confirmation that the weapon has been neutralized and that Krall is dead.

1042
01:36:57,277 --> 01:36:58,849
船长
Captain.

1043
01:37:05,169 --> 01:37:07,439
这是克劳干的，我们亲眼看过他把人吸干
It's Krall. We've seen him do this.

1044
01:37:07,701 --> 01:37:11,175
那是某种能量转移，同时也改变了他的外表
It's a somekind of energy transfer,and it physically changes him.

1045
01:37:11,347 --> 01:37:14,739
他可能还在船上，他们肯定是看到了他才被杀的
He must still be on board.No one seen him leave.

1046
01:37:16,571 --> 01:37:18,825
苏鲁，联系约克镇安全部门
Sulu, contact Yorktown security...

1047
01:37:18,826 --> 01:37:19,860
封锁这艘船
...to lockdown the ship.

1048
01:37:19,861 --> 01:37:20,861
我们走
Let's go.

1049
01:37:53,698 --> 01:37:55,192
船长
Captain.

1050
01:37:56,102 --> 01:37:58,102
<i>开拓疆域</i>
<i>...expand the frontier...</i>
1052
01:38:02,383 --> 01:38:05,034、
<i>开拓疆域</i>
<i>...expand the frontier...</i>

1051
01:38:22,124 --> 01:38:23,265
那就是他
It's him.

1052
01:38:24,554 --> 01:38:27,189
斯科特，连接富兰克林号上的数据库
Scotty, I need you to link to Franklin database.

1053
01:38:27,408 --> 01:38:29,804
给我找到一切有关巴尔萨泽 爱迪生的信息
Find out what you can about Balthazar Edison.

1054
01:38:29,860 --> 01:38:31,523
- 富兰克林号的船长？ - 没错
- What the Captain on a Franklin? - Yes.

1055
01:38:31,524 --> 01:38:33,164
长官，他很久以前就死了
He is long dead.

1056
01:38:33,189 --> 01:38:36,412
不，我不知道他怎么办到的，但是爱迪生和克劳是一个人
No he is not. I do not know how,but Edison is Krall.

1057
01:38:46,995 --> 01:38:48,085
你发现了什么？
What did you find?

1058
01:38:48,086 --> 01:38:51,019
他的记录可以追溯到星联成立之前
Well, his records goes back when Federation didn't even exist .

1059
01:38:51,020 --> 01:38:54,036
他原先是一位来自于MACO的少校
He was a major in the United Earth Military Assault Command Operation.

1060
01:38:54,037 --> 01:38:55,697
那个组织多次卷入旧世界的战争
Along in the offworld combat.

1061
01:38:55,698 --> 01:38:58,093
- 他曾是一位军人 - 没错，先生，还是一位战功卓著的军人
- He was a soldier. - Ay, sir. And pretty good one.

1062
01:38:58,094 --> 01:39:00,679
MACO解散之后他的军事生涯也随之结束
His military service came to an end when MACO was disbanded.

1063
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:01,680
为什么会解散？发生了什么事？
Why? What happened ?

1064
01:39:01,681 --> 01:39:04,491
星际联盟成立了，长官，后来还成立了星际舰队，我们又不是一个军事组织
The Federation sir, Starfleet.We are not a military agency.

1065
01:39:04,492 --> 01:39:06,198
星际舰队让他当上了富兰克林号的船长
They made him captain and gave him a Franklin.

1066
01:39:06,414 --> 01:39:07,955
- 斯科特，把他的日志调出来 - 是，长官
- Scotty, bring up his logs. - Ay, sir.

1067
01:39:09,791 --> 01:39:10,842
<i>航行日志</i>
<i>Captain's Log...</i>

1068
01:39:10,877 --> 01:39:12,142
直接翻到最后一条
The last record.

1069
01:39:12,519 --> 01:39:16,326
<i>航行日志，我已经不记得星历了</i>
<i>Captain's Log....I don't remember the Stardate.</i>

1070
01:39:17,876 --> 01:39:20,242
<i>没人注意到我们的求救信号</i>
<i>All distress calls are nonsense.</i>

1071
01:39:20,923 --> 01:39:25,083
<i>船员也只剩下了三人</i>
<i>Of the crew, only 3 remain.</i>

1072
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:27,345
<i>我会死在这的</i>
<i>I will only die.</i>

1073
01:39:29,919 --> 01:39:33,327
<i>这里的土生物种很久以前就放弃了这个星球</i>
<i>The indiginous race abandoned this planet long ago.</i>

1074
01:39:33,390 --> 01:39:36,688
<i>他们留下了很多复杂的钻探设备</i>
<i>They left behind sophisticated mining equipment
</i>

1075
01:39:36,689 --> 01:39:39,067
<i>和大量的机群</i>
<i>and a drone platforms.</i>

1076
01:39:39,068 --> 01:39:42,103
<i>他们有一种特殊的科技</i>
<i>They had some sort of technology...</i>

1077
01:39:42,442 --> 01:39:43,656
<i>能延长我的</i>
<i>...that prolongs...</i>

1078
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:46,180
<i>寿命</i>
<i>...life.</i>

1079
01:39:46,220 --> 01:39:49,216
<i>我会不惜一切代价为我和我的船员复仇</i>
<i>I'll do whatever it takes for me and my crew.</i>

1080
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:52,425
<i>星联根本不在意我们的死活</i>
<i>The Federation do not care about us.</i>

1081
01:39:57,839 --> 01:40:00,340
<i>也许你们永远都不会再见到我了.</i>
<i>Probably never see me again...</i>

1082
01:40:00,669 --> 01:40:02,637
<i>但如果我出现在你们面前</i>
<i>...but if you do...</i>

1083
01:40:03,815 --> 01:40:05,155
<i>你们就准备受死吧</i>
<i>...be ready.</i>

1084
01:40:06,889 --> 01:40:08,843
为什么他还没使用他的生物武器？
Why has he not used his weapon yet?

1085
01:40:09,028 --> 01:40:11,588
因为他想找一个能最大化其武器威力的地方来释放它
Because he wants to find somewhere to inflict maximum damage.

1086
01:40:11,589 --> 01:40:13,603
他需要一个空气流通系统
He needs a distribution system.

1087
01:40:14,401 --> 01:40:15,894
约克镇里有这样的系统吧？
Circulating area, right?

1088
01:40:15,895 --> 01:40:18,686
是的，先生，它的中心有一台大气调节器
Ay, sir. There's a atmospheric regulator core.

1089
01:40:18,687 --> 01:40:19,833
中尉，马上联系约克镇安全部门
Lieutenant, contact Yorktown...

1090
01:40:19,834 --> 01:40:21,845
没找到克劳之前，先把系统关闭
...make sure they shut it down before it finds Krall.

1091
01:40:22,597 --> 01:40:23,732
我要怎么才能去核心那边
How we access the core?

1092
01:40:24,949 --> 01:40:27,443
约克镇站重力核心附近有一座维修塔
Well, there is a maintenance tower at the stations gravitational nexus.

1093
01:40:27,444 --> 01:40:28,518
想去大气调节器只能通过那里了
That's the only way.

1094
01:40:28,519 --> 01:40:30,825
斯科特，你去约克镇总部，务必把它关闭
Scotty,get over there and make sure it gets shutdown.

1095
01:40:30,970 --> 01:40:32,569
美女，跟我来
Lassie, with me.

1096
01:40:45,754 --> 01:40:47,850
听我说，大气调节器是关不掉的
Look, this thing is impossible to shut down.

1097
01:40:48,073 --> 01:40:49,111
是么
Alright, well.

1098
01:40:51,525 --> 01:40:53,004
让我来试试看
Let's see about that.

1099
01:41:00,651 --> 01:41:02,723
斯科特先生，这玩意怎么还没关掉
Mr. Scott,why is that thing still on?

1100
01:41:02,758 --> 01:41:05,648
我们还在想办法，长官，但你应该明白我要突破很多安全协议
I'm working on that, sir, but as you can imagine there's a lot of safety protocols, so...

1101
01:41:05,683 --> 01:41:07,879
这个系统太结实了，你知道的，要不然会出事的
I need to think that you know keeps everybody alive.

1102
01:41:07,904 --> 01:41:09,203
赶紧想点办法
Find something out.

1103
01:41:09,228 --> 01:41:12,350
小心点，船长，你越靠近中心
Be careful captain.A gravity is gonna get a bit screwy...

1104
01:41:12,385 --> 01:41:13,722
重力的作用就越大
...the closer you get to the center.

1105
01:41:14,010 --> 01:41:16,844
我们应该扫描一下运行图，看看有没有后门
Maybe, we should scan the operations schematics.See if there is a backdoor.

1106
01:41:16,879 --> 01:41:18,303
姑娘，我要你帮我盯着屏幕
Lassie, I'm gonna need your eyes.

1107
01:41:36,176 --> 01:41:38,525
你在那都经历了些什么
What happened when you were out there...

1108
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:40,705
爱迪生
Edison.

1109
01:41:41,182 --> 01:41:43,059
你居然知道我的原名？
Edison?

1110
01:41:45,676 --> 01:41:48,370
不得不说，柯克
I have to say Kirk

1111
01:41:49,394 --> 01:41:51,745
我很怀念过去的我
I missed being me.

1112
01:41:53,053 --> 01:41:55,685
我们三个人失去了人性
We lost ourselve,

1113
01:41:55,686 --> 01:41:57,335
但是达到目的了
But I gained a purpose.

1114
01:41:57,706 --> 01:42:01,317
我们找到了让银河系回归混乱的方法
It means to bring the galaxy extra trouble

1115
01:42:01,718 --> 01:42:04,608
让人类在抗争中变得更加强大
that makes humanity strong.

1116
01:42:05,032 --> 01:42:06,850
我觉得你误解了人性
I think you underestimate humanity.

1117
01:42:06,851 --> 01:42:08,683
我曾经为人性而战！
I fought for humanity!

1118
01:42:09,339 --> 01:42:13,986
在同新地人和罗慕伦人的战争中我们牺牲了数百万人
We lost millions with the Xindi and Romulan wars.

1119
01:42:14,087 --> 01:42:15,418
我们为了什么？
And for what?

1120
01:42:15,645 --> 01:42:19,220
难道是为了让我在星联的操纵下，坐在船长的位置上
For the Federation to sit in the captains chair.

1121
01:42:19,221 --> 01:42:22,259
同敌人握手言和？
And regret it with the enemy?

1122
01:42:22,645 --> 01:42:25,172
人是会改变的，而且我们必须那么做
We change. We have to.

1123
01:42:26,123 --> 01:42:28,919
否则我们就要一辈子争斗下去
We spend the rest of our lives fighting the same battles.

1124
01:43:06,025 --> 01:43:07,213
你已经输了
You lost!

1125
01:43:07,499 --> 01:43:09,803
你不可能过的去的
You no way you can make to get back there.

1126
01:43:12,879 --> 01:43:14,467
放弃吧
You are out.

1127
01:43:15,352 --> 01:43:16,990
就像你这个懦夫一样吗？
Like you did?

1128
01:43:19,113 --> 01:43:21,154
我读过你的航行日志
I read your simple log.

1129
01:43:21,577 --> 01:43:23,793
詹姆斯 T. 柯克船长
Captain James T. Kirk.

1130
01:43:23,794 --> 01:43:25,632
至少我还知道我是谁
Least I know who I am.

1131
01:43:27,038 --> 01:43:28,430
我是一位军人
I'm a soldier.

1132
01:43:29,110 --> 01:43:31,639
爱迪生，你为人类打赢了战争
You won the war, Edison.

1133
01:43:32,055 --> 01:43:33,499
你为我们创造了和平
You gave us peace.

1134
01:43:34,319 --> 01:43:35,598
和平
Peace...

1135
01:43:36,555 --> 01:43:38,929
我生来不是为了和平
It's not a world I was born into.

1136
01:43:42,288 --> 01:43:43,481
- 斯科特 - 船长
- Scotty. - Captain.

1137
01:43:43,506 --> 01:43:46,991
他在利用重力涡流滑行回到中心
He is using the gravitational slipstream to get back to the center.

1138
01:44:29,286 --> 01:44:30,337
不！
No!

1139
01:44:40,838 --> 01:44:41,915
武器已经激活了
Weapon's in the chamber.

1140
01:44:41,950 --> 01:44:43,770
船长，我们必须马上阻止他
Captain we have to stop the processor

1141
01:44:43,805 --> 01:44:46,384
要不然约克镇里所有需要呼吸的生物都死定了
or everything breathing in Yorktown is dead.

1142
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:57,806
你没法阻止这一切
You can't stop it.

1143
01:44:59,699 --> 01:45:01,252
你死定了
You will die.

1144
01:45:01,683 --> 01:45:03,675
至少我是为了拯救生命而死
Better to die saving lives

1145
01:45:04,652 --> 01:45:06,314
比通过夺取他人性命让自己活着要好
Than to live with taking them.

1146
01:45:07,730 --> 01:45:09,309
这就是我活着的意义
That's what I was born into.

1147
01:45:10,937 --> 01:45:13,278
- 斯科特 - 长官，我想我能重新导引气流方向
- Scotty. - Captain, I think we can redirect it.

1148
01:45:13,313 --> 01:45:15,107
房间里有一个密封舱口
There's a seal construction, perhaps

1149
01:45:15,142 --> 01:45:16,670
打开阀门就能把武器排放到太空中
that will let you vent the weapon into space.

1150
01:45:16,705 --> 01:45:19,863
我可以在这边远程解锁，还需要你在那边手动操作阀门
Now we can override the locks, from out here,but you have to activate the hatch.

1151
01:45:19,888 --> 01:45:22,229
- 就是按一下按钮？ - 不是按钮，长官
- I just've to hit the button. - It's not a button, sir.

1152
01:45:22,264 --> 01:45:24,070
白色面板下面有一个把手
It's a simple lever under the white panel.

1153
01:45:25,357 --> 01:45:27,100
- 看到了 - 总共有四个
- Got it. - And there's 4 of them.

1154
01:45:28,112 --> 01:45:30,987
一旦你把舱口打开，你必须马上离开房间
Once you have activated lock,you've to exit the chamber immediately.

1155
01:45:31,012 --> 01:45:33,357
如果流通器正在运转，舱口打开，你还在那个房间里
If the hatch is opened when the CPU starts next cycle

1156
01:45:33,392 --> 01:45:34,927
你就会被吸入太空中
you are gonna get sucked into space.

1157
01:45:35,407 --> 01:45:37,162
如果我打不开舱口呢？
What happens when the hatch isn't opened?

1158
01:45:37,187 --> 01:45:39,137
你和生物武器都会被吸入一个流通系统里
You are gonna get sucked into big fan.

1159
01:45:39,172 --> 01:45:41,006
我们所有人都死定了
With the weapon and we all die.

1160
01:45:42,719 --> 01:45:44,625
该死的，吉姆，你恐怕没法按时出去了
Dammit, Jim, you won't make it out on time.

1161
01:45:54,773 --> 01:45:55,536
流通器打开了
The vent.

1162
01:45:57,445 --> 01:45:59,182
詹姆斯 T.,快走
Get out of there, James T.

1163
01:46:00,492 --> 01:46:02,677
动作快点
Scotty, the last hatch won't open.

1164
01:46:09,491 --> 01:46:12,107
- 斯科特 - 动作快点，船长，你还有8秒钟
- Scotty. - Work fast, Captain. Time is running out.

1165
01:46:12,259 --> 01:46:13,759
恐怕他搞不定了
He is not gonna make it.

1166
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:29,560
没有你我该怎么办，史波克
What would I do without you, Spock?

1167
01:48:01,883 --> 01:48:04,884
<i>（结案）</i>
这么多年来，星联一直宣传说他是一位英雄
For decades,the Federation taught that he was a hero.

1168
01:48:05,257 --> 01:48:07,624
只有时间才能说明一切
I guess time would judge us all.

1169
01:48:09,746 --> 01:48:11,218
他是在太空中迷失了自我罢了
He just got lost.

1170
01:48:11,532 --> 01:48:13,791
柯克，你拯救了整个基地
You saved this entire base, Kirk.

1171
01:48:14,984 --> 01:48:17,954
挽救了数以百万的生命，谢谢你
Millions of souls. Thank you.

1172
01:48:18,310 --> 01:48:21,150
这不仅仅是我一个人的功劳，从来都不是
It wasn't just me. Never is.

1173
01:48:21,652 --> 01:48:25,495
我们考虑过你的申请了，你现在是舰队中将了
It's easy to say that the position of Vice Admiral, it's yours.

1174
01:48:26,379 --> 01:48:28,296
没人比你更适合这个职位
No one deserves it more.

1175
01:48:31,647 --> 01:48:33,771
舰队中将是不是不需要随舰航行?
Vice Admirals don't fly do they?

1176
01:48:34,823 --> 01:48:35,846
对
No.

1177
01:48:35,870 --> 01:48:37,270
不需要
They don't.

1178
01:48:39,870 --> 01:48:41,460
无意冒犯，女士
No offense, ma'am but...

1179
01:48:43,149 --> 01:48:44,595
那有什么好玩的呢？
...where's the fun in that?

1180
01:49:47,094 --> 01:49:49,230
你都没试着申请一下缩减任务时间？
You didn't even try to get our time reduced?

1181
01:49:49,565 --> 01:49:50,771
为啥要缩短任务时间？
Why would I get it reduced?

1182
01:49:50,806 --> 01:49:53,112
老骨头，我们现在可以去其它星云航行了
Bones, we know our way through the nebula now.

1183
01:49:53,470 --> 01:49:54,737
想想看我们在那边会发现什么
Can you imagine, what we'll find?

1184
01:49:54,762 --> 01:49:57,279
一心想着消灭人类的外星暴君？
Alien deathspots,Calvenom killing us.

1185
01:49:57,378 --> 01:49:59,817
致命的外星病菌？
Deadly space worm, viruses and bacteria.

1186
01:50:00,016 --> 01:50:03,711
还是瞬间能把我们消灭于无形的宇宙异类？
Incomprehensible cosmic anomalies that could wipe us out in an instant.

1187
01:50:04,078 --> 01:50:06,077
那多有意思啊
It's gonna be so much fun.

1188
01:50:07,466 --> 01:50:09,872
顺便问一句，我们这是要去哪来着，我还以为我们要去喝一杯呢
By the way, where're we going?I thought we were gonna get drink.

1189
01:50:10,259 --> 01:50:12,668
我记得你曾经让我保密，但是...
I know you told me to keep it under wraps, but...

1190
01:50:12,693 --> 01:50:14,817
生日快乐！
Happy birthday!

1191
01:50:17,170 --> 01:50:18,915
感觉如何？
Mr Sensitive ?

1192
01:50:19,700 --> 01:50:21,015
谢谢你，斯科特

各位，举起手中的酒，敬我们的船长詹姆斯 T.柯克一杯
Everybody raise your glass to Captain James T. Kirk.

1194
01:50:27,006 --> 01:50:28,694
- 柯克船长 - 谢谢各位

1195

1196

和我们逝去的朋友
...and to absent friends.

1197
01:50:37,856 --> 01:50:38,878
干杯
Cheers.

1198
01:50:40,490 --> 01:50:42,874
派对开始喽
Alright, let's get this party started.

1199
01:50:48,279 --> 01:50:50,299
我还以为你要先写完你的任务报告
I thought you have to finish your mission report.

1200
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:52,540
我本来是那么打算的
I do.

1201
01:50:52,674 --> 01:50:55,681
但是我觉得和你一起参加社交活动能让你更开心
But I thought it would be more pleasing to engage with you socialy.

1202
01:50:58,101 --> 01:50:59,795
你的恋爱套路真是老套
You old romantic.

1203
01:51:07,881 --> 01:51:12,111
你知道吗，苏格兰威士忌其实是由一位年轻的俄国女士发明的？
Do you know that scotch was actually invented by little lady in Russia?

1204
01:51:13,735 --> 01:51:15,235
抱歉失陪一下
Excuse me.

1205
01:51:17,277 --> 01:51:20,262
你一个人喝了这么多？真令人惊讶
Did you drink all those yourself?I am impressed.

1206
01:51:20,887 --> 01:51:22,774
有人告诉我说喝这个能让人放松
Someone said that it will take my edge off.

1207
01:51:23,761 --> 01:51:25,548
喝了这么多我还是不觉得轻松
My edge is still not off.

1208
01:51:25,794 --> 01:51:27,360
也许这个能让你开心点
Alright, gold, maybe this will help.

1209
01:51:28,939 --> 01:51:30,765
船长找了点关系
Captain pulled a few strings.

1210
01:51:31,151 --> 01:51:34,771
如果你愿意的话，你可以加入星舰学院
That is acceptance into Starfleet Academy,if you want to.

1211
01:51:34,827 --> 01:51:37,576
那儿的条条框框很多
We have a lot rules.No less, no more.

1212
01:51:37,822 --> 01:51:39,784
我是不是必须穿那个制服？
Will I have to wear that uniform?

1213
01:51:41,173 --> 01:51:42,862
恐怕是的
I'm afraid so.

1214
01:51:45,131 --> 01:51:46,221
你好，昆赛尔
Hey, Keenser.

1215
01:51:46,269 --> 01:51:48,384
凯文，你终于开始穿裤子了？
Kevin, is there no way to wear pants?

1216
01:51:55,338 --> 01:51:57,153
我听说了史波克大使的事
I heard about Ambassador Spock.

1217
01:51:59,375 --> 01:52:01,024
上次在电梯里
Is that what you wanted to mention...

1218
01:52:01,234 --> 01:52:03,234
你就想跟我说这个？
...that time in the turbolift?

1219
01:52:05,631 --> 01:52:06,817
差不多吧
More or less.

1220
01:52:09,277 --> 01:52:11,773
我想你和帕里斯指挥官的会面进行的十分顺利吧
I trust your meeting with Comandant Harris went well.

1221
01:52:15,609 --> 01:52:17,214
差不多吧
More or less.

1222
01:52:25,145 --> 01:52:26,676
你是不是很渴望继续到太空中航行？
You really want to head back out there, huh?

1223
01:52:53,942 --> 01:52:56,712
宇宙，最后的边疆
Space, the final frontier.

1224
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:01,386
这是进取号星舰的旅程
These are voyagers of the starship Enterprise.

1225
01:53:02,005 --> 01:53:05,895
她正在进行的任务，是去探索这未知的新世界
It's continuing mission to explore strange new worlds...

1226
01:53:06,314 --> 01:53:09,706
