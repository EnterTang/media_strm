1
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,018
I still can't believe
we're really on our way.

2
00:02:22,052 --> 00:02:23,986
Nor can I.

3
00:02:24,022 --> 00:02:26,149
It's so fantastic.

4
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:27,679
Thank you, darling.

5
00:02:35,534 --> 00:02:37,764
Don't run away.
I won't be a sec.

6
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,789
Fiona.

7
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:40,263
Blimey.

8
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:41,565
What's the matter?

9
00:03:41,605 --> 00:03:43,937
Can you give me a hand?

10
00:03:45,411 --> 00:03:47,139
There we are.

11
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,239
God.

12
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:54,451
There we go, that's better.

13
00:03:54,487 --> 00:03:57,547
I'm going to wipe away
those tears.

14
00:04:02,662 --> 00:04:03,822
God.

15
00:04:08,434 --> 00:04:11,064
Take a deep breath.

16
00:04:11,103 --> 00:04:12,696
You'll feel better.

17
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:15,834
A deep breath of fresh air,
that's what you need.

18
00:04:15,876 --> 00:04:17,037
Here.

19
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:19,912
- There.
- You're very pretty.

20
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:24,475
There we are.

21
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,680
There.

22
00:04:29,391 --> 00:04:31,256
Are you going to Istanbul?

23
00:04:31,293 --> 00:04:34,626
Yes. Then we're flying
on to Bombay.

24
00:04:34,664 --> 00:04:36,722
How far are you going?

25
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:40,332
Further.

26
00:04:43,106 --> 00:04:44,597
Much further.

27
00:04:47,244 --> 00:04:50,077
But why on earth go to India?

28
00:04:50,113 --> 00:04:53,083
I think we needed a break
from the rat race...

29
00:04:53,117 --> 00:04:55,779
and India's got so much
to teach the West.

30
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,754
Really? What, for example?

31
00:04:57,787 --> 00:05:01,281
Well, you know, inner serenity,
that kind of stuff.

32
00:05:01,326 --> 00:05:05,023
The Karma-Nirvana syndrome.
Lot of poppycock, I'm afraid.

33
00:05:05,064 --> 00:05:07,531
No, India's all flies,
smells, and beggars...

34
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:11,059
and as for serenity, it's
the noisiest place on earth.

35
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:13,469
If you say so, I'm sure.

36
00:05:13,506 --> 00:05:16,168
Now, I'm sure Mr. Singh
is just being modest...

37
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,471
about his own part
of the world.

38
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:19,637
I can't wait to get there.

39
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:21,147
It's my anniversary treat.

40
00:05:21,182 --> 00:05:23,240
We've been married
for seven years.

41
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:25,808
So it's a form
of marital therapy.

42
00:05:25,853 --> 00:05:27,081
It's quite unnecessary,
dear lady.

43
00:05:27,121 --> 00:05:29,112
With a wife as beautiful
as yourself...

44
00:05:29,156 --> 00:05:31,521
any man would be proof
against the seven-year itch.

45
00:05:36,898 --> 00:05:38,092
You tired, sweetheart?

46
00:05:38,134 --> 00:05:39,828
Absolutely whacked.

47
00:05:39,868 --> 00:05:41,860
Must be all this sea air.

48
00:05:44,273 --> 00:05:45,706
How about a nightcap?

49
00:05:45,741 --> 00:05:46,867
How about bed?

50
00:05:46,908 --> 00:05:48,433
Come on, just one.

51
00:05:48,477 --> 00:05:50,445
No, honestly not. You go.

52
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:53,277
Just take me to my cabin.
I'm out on my feet.

53
00:05:53,314 --> 00:05:54,715
If you're sure.

54
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,876
I'm certain.

55
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,887
Anyway, it's bad
for an old married couple...

56
00:05:57,922 --> 00:06:01,220
to be glued together
all the time.

57
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,259
What will it be, sir?

58
00:06:40,301 --> 00:06:42,029
Whiskey and soda, please.

59
00:07:12,702 --> 00:07:14,364
You feeling better?

60
00:07:14,404 --> 00:07:16,065
Better than what?

61
00:07:16,106 --> 00:07:17,869
You remember the...

62
00:07:17,907 --> 00:07:20,603
this afternoon in the...

63
00:07:20,643 --> 00:07:22,111
in the loo.

64
00:07:22,144 --> 00:07:23,443
The loo?

65
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,005
Is it your usual pickup routine?

66
00:07:33,658 --> 00:07:35,593
Of course I remember.

67
00:07:35,628 --> 00:07:38,495
I have a perfect memory...

68
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,725
when I feel like it.

69
00:07:40,766 --> 00:07:42,131
Right.

70
00:07:43,435 --> 00:07:45,926
Is this some kind of game?

71
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:49,431
You want to dance?

72
00:07:50,777 --> 00:07:53,337
I'm not much of a dancer.

73
00:07:55,148 --> 00:07:56,514
That figures.

74
00:08:02,924 --> 00:08:04,482
What's your name?

75
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:05,685
Nigel Dobson.

76
00:08:09,264 --> 00:08:12,664
OK, Nigel, amuse me.

77
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,430
Say something funny.

78
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:18,568
Blimey.

79
00:08:20,576 --> 00:08:24,103
You're French, aren't you?
I can tell from your accent.

80
00:08:24,147 --> 00:08:25,944
Your English is very, very good,
but for some reason...

81
00:08:25,983 --> 00:08:28,280
I can always tell
with frogs.

82
00:08:28,318 --> 00:08:30,980
Sorry. Stupid thing to say.

83
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,749
Just slipped out.
Schoolboy expression.

84
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,156
Comes from working in the city.
I'm a Eurobond dealer.

85
00:08:35,191 --> 00:08:36,888
We're always
calling people frogs.

86
00:08:38,762 --> 00:08:40,195
You're right. Boring.

87
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:44,224
But, anyway, you call us
roast beef, don't you?

88
00:08:44,268 --> 00:08:45,498
They're roast beef.

89
00:08:45,537 --> 00:08:48,336
I think that's how you
pronounce it, anyway.

90
00:08:48,373 --> 00:08:50,841
You're too funny for me, Nigel.

91
00:08:50,876 --> 00:08:52,433
I'm choking with laughter.

92
00:08:55,647 --> 00:08:57,115
So long.

93
00:08:57,149 --> 00:09:01,142
I leave you to your magnetic,
irresistible personality.

94
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,699
Romantic, isn't it?

95
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:14,597
Yeah, it is. Splendid.

96
00:09:20,741 --> 00:09:22,233
You're Nigel, aren't you?

97
00:09:24,947 --> 00:09:26,881
Sorry. Do I know you?

98
00:09:29,751 --> 00:09:31,242
Beware of her.

99
00:09:34,056 --> 00:09:35,216
Right.

100
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:38,920
She's a walking man trap.

101
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:40,726
Sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

102
00:09:40,764 --> 00:09:41,992
Sure, you do.

103
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:44,993
I'm her husband.

104
00:09:46,737 --> 00:09:49,227
Look what she did to me.

105
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,805
I'm sorry.

106
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:55,676
Let me ask you something, Nigel.

107
00:09:55,713 --> 00:09:59,172
You don't mind
if I call you Nigel, do you?

108
00:09:59,217 --> 00:10:01,583
What do you think of her?

109
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,054
If you mean
who I think you mean...

110
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:05,716
she's very good-looking.

111
00:10:05,756 --> 00:10:07,816
Yeah, sure,
all of that and more.

112
00:10:07,859 --> 00:10:10,384
She gives you a hard-on,
doesn't she?

113
00:10:10,429 --> 00:10:13,728
- Beg your pardon?
- Come on, don't be so British.

114
00:10:13,766 --> 00:10:17,099
You'd like to fuck her.
Admit it. It's no crime.

115
00:10:17,136 --> 00:10:19,104
I've no idea
what you're driving at.

116
00:10:19,138 --> 00:10:20,629
Cut the crap!

117
00:10:20,674 --> 00:10:24,872
You're itching to know
some more about her, aren't you?

118
00:10:24,911 --> 00:10:26,903
Well, aren't you?

119
00:10:26,946 --> 00:10:28,244
Here.

120
00:10:28,281 --> 00:10:30,842
Do me a favor, would you?

121
00:10:30,884 --> 00:10:33,853
Help me over
the goddamn step here.

122
00:10:33,886 --> 00:10:36,948
They don't design these boats
for my kind.

123
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,151
Yeah, sure.

124
00:10:39,894 --> 00:10:41,361
Get inside there.

125
00:10:43,198 --> 00:10:46,224
Grab the wheels. The wheels.

126
00:10:46,268 --> 00:10:47,428
Up.

127
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:56,069
I hate these fucking boats.

128
00:11:02,886 --> 00:11:07,346
It's good of you to take pity
on an obnoxious cripple.

129
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,824
I don't know you at all...

130
00:11:09,859 --> 00:11:11,521
but somehow
I have the feeling...

131
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:15,499
that you're exactly the listener
that I've been looking for.

132
00:11:15,534 --> 00:11:18,969
I hope you'll find
my story interesting.

133
00:11:19,003 --> 00:11:22,302
I realize it's hard
to relate to something...

134
00:11:22,341 --> 00:11:24,741
that doesn't concern you.

135
00:11:24,776 --> 00:11:26,767
Or maybe it already does.

136
00:11:35,722 --> 00:11:39,124
We have the place to ourselves.

137
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:41,184
Mimi has her own cabin.

138
00:11:48,134 --> 00:11:49,295
Thanks.

139
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,076
Eternity for me began
one fall day in Paris...

140
00:12:03,118 --> 00:12:04,744
aboard the 96 bus...

141
00:12:04,786 --> 00:12:07,347
which shuttles
between Montparnasse...

142
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,118
and Porte des Lilas.

143
00:12:46,664 --> 00:12:49,191
Controle des billets,
s'il vous plait.

144
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,039
Mademoiselle.

145
00:13:09,824 --> 00:13:10,985
Madame.

146
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:19,293
Merci.

147
00:13:26,376 --> 00:13:29,107
Monsieur, votre billet,
s'il vous plait.

148
00:13:31,181 --> 00:13:33,341
Je ne I'ai pas.

149
00:14:03,983 --> 00:14:06,452
I'd been granted
a glimpse of Heaven...

150
00:14:06,486 --> 00:14:09,284
then dumped on the sidewalk
at rue d'Assas.

151
00:14:09,323 --> 00:14:12,588
I still have no idea
why you're telling me all this.

152
00:14:12,626 --> 00:14:16,187
I'd always wanted
to be a writer.

153
00:14:16,229 --> 00:14:17,924
My grandfather...

154
00:14:17,965 --> 00:14:20,933
made a fortune in the surgical
appliance business...

155
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:23,459
and set up a trust fund for me.

156
00:14:23,504 --> 00:14:25,631
On his death,
I found myself in receipt...

157
00:14:25,673 --> 00:14:29,508
of sufficient allowance
to enable me to move to Paris.

158
00:14:35,284 --> 00:14:36,649
Paris...

159
00:14:36,685 --> 00:14:38,845
my dream city.

160
00:14:38,887 --> 00:14:40,719
Hemingway, Miller...

161
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:42,452
Scott Fitzgerald.

162
00:14:42,492 --> 00:14:46,053
I was determined to follow
in their footsteps...

163
00:14:46,097 --> 00:14:49,065
maybe too determined
for my own good.

164
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,536
Maybe that's what killed any
originality I ever possessed.

165
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,697
After eight years,
all I had to show...

166
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,574
for my literary exertions were
three unpublished novels...

167
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:03,047
and a stack
of reject slips this high.

168
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,810
But who cared?

169
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:06,613
Sidewalk cafes...

170
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:08,346
fluttering skirts...

171
00:15:08,386 --> 00:15:10,184
fleeting affairs.

172
00:15:10,222 --> 00:15:15,159
Paris was heaven
until that day on the bus.

173
00:15:38,653 --> 00:15:39,881
Et tu m'aides?

174
00:15:48,596 --> 00:15:51,464
It was no good.

175
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:54,332
I couldn't write,
couldn't sleep...

176
00:15:54,369 --> 00:15:57,271
couldn't get her out of my mind.

177
00:15:57,306 --> 00:16:00,276
She was somewhere out there...

178
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:03,540
my sorceress in white sneakers.

179
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,138
But where?

180
00:16:11,955 --> 00:16:15,154
I haunted that 96 bus route.

181
00:16:15,194 --> 00:16:17,128
It became an obsession.

182
00:16:17,161 --> 00:16:19,892
Even the drivers
began to recognize me.

183
00:16:19,932 --> 00:16:21,263
Ca va?

184
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,669
Désirez un apéritif?

185
00:17:36,714 --> 00:17:38,011
Moi, je meurs de faun.

186
00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:39,414
Ouais, ouais moi aussi.

187
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:43,079
Alors on commande tout de suite.
Qu'est-ce qui vous tente?

188
00:17:43,122 --> 00:17:45,919
Alors, mois,
j'ai envie d'un tartare.

189
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,984
- Voil?
- Un tartare.

190
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:54,627
Non attendez plutot
une soupe du jour pour moi.

191
00:17:58,538 --> 00:17:59,834
Non finalement.

192
00:17:59,873 --> 00:18:03,639
J'vais prendre un avocat
avec des crevattes.

193
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:11,407
J'aurais un apéritif après tout.

194
00:18:11,452 --> 00:18:13,444
Heu martini.

195
00:18:13,488 --> 00:18:14,647
Double.

196
00:18:16,023 --> 00:18:17,150
Et vous?

197
00:18:17,192 --> 00:18:21,059
Moi je prendrai un kir royal,
s'il vous plait.

198
00:18:23,998 --> 00:18:25,695
Excusez-moi.

199
00:18:30,673 --> 00:18:31,834
Je suis desole...

200
00:18:31,874 --> 00:18:34,001
je ne pouvais pas vous
parler tout a I'heure.

201
00:18:34,043 --> 00:18:35,170
C'est pas grave.

202
00:18:35,212 --> 00:18:36,337
Vous rappelez?

203
00:18:36,379 --> 00:18:37,506
You're American?

204
00:18:37,547 --> 00:18:39,037
You remember me?

205
00:18:39,082 --> 00:18:41,517
Of course I remember.
You were very kind.

206
00:18:41,552 --> 00:18:44,021
Now it's your turn
to do something nice for me.

207
00:18:44,054 --> 00:18:46,181
Have dinner with me sometime.
Sometime soon, like tomorrow.

208
00:18:46,224 --> 00:18:47,385
You ever get a night off?

209
00:18:47,425 --> 00:18:48,585
- Yes.
- When?

210
00:18:48,626 --> 00:18:49,855
- Tomorrow.
- Well?

211
00:18:49,894 --> 00:18:52,021
Mimi, magnes le cul?
ca planche!

212
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,765
Mimi.

213
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:02,602
She told me to meet her...

214
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:06,101
at the Centre du Marais
at 10:30.

215
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:07,669
I was so wound up...

216
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:10,842
I'd gotten there
a whole half-hour early.

217
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:14,149
My nerve ends
were jangling like bells.

218
00:19:59,438 --> 00:20:01,929
Here's to old bus route 96.

219
00:20:11,482 --> 00:20:13,075
Voil? voil? voil?

220
00:20:13,118 --> 00:20:15,712
Bonsoir, bonsoir,
monsieur, madame...

221
00:20:15,754 --> 00:20:19,748
vous allez bien qu'est-ce
que vous préfèrez ce soir?

222
00:20:19,792 --> 00:20:22,124
Should we just let him decide?

223
00:20:22,162 --> 00:20:23,628
Ecoutez m'sieur mi char...

224
00:20:23,663 --> 00:20:26,188
ce soir on vous laisse
I'initiative.

225
00:20:26,232 --> 00:20:27,495
Alors, alors.

226
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:29,694
Permettez-moi
de proposer pour commencer...

227
00:20:29,737 --> 00:20:31,204
"Perle du Blue Elephant. "

228
00:20:31,238 --> 00:20:32,829
Non, non, non.
Surprenez-nous.

229
00:20:32,873 --> 00:20:34,340
Très bien, très bien, monsieur.

230
00:20:34,374 --> 00:20:35,840
Faites moi confiance.

231
00:20:35,876 --> 00:20:38,367
I hope, I hope
I didn't make a mistake...

232
00:20:38,412 --> 00:20:39,880
by letting him order...

233
00:20:39,914 --> 00:20:42,382
because I don't speak Thai
so good...

234
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:46,410
and we might have wound up
eating puppy-dog tails.

235
00:20:48,891 --> 00:20:50,380
Do you mind if I do?

236
00:21:56,865 --> 00:22:00,494
There was a freshness
and innocence about her...

237
00:22:00,534 --> 00:22:02,469
an almost disconcerting blend...

238
00:22:02,504 --> 00:22:05,701
of sexual maturity
and childish naivet?..

239
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,208
that touched
my world-weary heart...

240
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:11,213
and effaced the age difference
between us.

241
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:15,685
My roommate is American. Cindy.
You saw her at the dance class.

242
00:22:15,719 --> 00:22:17,583
I met her
when I study in New York.

243
00:22:17,621 --> 00:22:18,917
How long were you there?

244
00:22:18,955 --> 00:22:20,924
Till my money ran out.

245
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,549
Meaning?

246
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:25,153
Six months. I love New York.

247
00:22:25,194 --> 00:22:27,993
It's the best place
for a dancer. Not for a writer?

248
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,865
Not this one.
I love Paris too much.

249
00:22:30,903 --> 00:22:33,871
Is that what you write about,
Paris?

250
00:22:33,906 --> 00:22:35,338
Paris and people.

251
00:22:35,373 --> 00:22:37,840
Would you let me
read something of yours?

252
00:22:37,876 --> 00:22:39,435
Would you dance for me sometime?

253
00:22:39,477 --> 00:22:41,274
If you like.

254
00:22:41,312 --> 00:22:42,438
Promise?

255
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,811
Promise.

256
00:23:28,531 --> 00:23:32,024
I looked all over for you,
you know.

257
00:23:32,069 --> 00:23:34,094
Did you ever think
you'd see me again?

258
00:23:35,471 --> 00:23:36,597
Really?

259
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,504
Really.

260
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:39,701
Really?

261
00:23:47,018 --> 00:23:48,508
You kept it.

262
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,324
My feet are cold.

263
00:24:49,785 --> 00:24:51,413
Oh, you have a fireplace.

264
00:24:51,455 --> 00:24:52,944
Does it work?

265
00:24:52,989 --> 00:24:54,514
It sure does.

266
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:56,856
Why don't you relax
for a second?

267
00:24:56,893 --> 00:24:58,360
I'll make coffee.

268
00:24:58,394 --> 00:25:01,058
- Would you like a hot chocolate?
- Yes, please. Chocolate.

269
00:25:01,098 --> 00:25:02,690
Could we make a fire?

270
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:04,598
Why not?

271
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:08,071
You make the fire,
I'll make the coffee...

272
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:09,596
and the chocolate.

273
00:27:25,421 --> 00:27:27,514
Nothing ever surpassed
the rapture...

274
00:27:27,557 --> 00:27:29,322
of that first awakening.

275
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,328
I might have been Adam...

276
00:27:31,362 --> 00:27:34,263
with the taste of apple
fresh in my mouth.

277
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:37,393
I was looking at all the beauty
in the world...

278
00:27:37,434 --> 00:27:39,699
embodied in a single
female form...

279
00:27:39,736 --> 00:27:43,468
and I knew, with sudden
blinding certainty...

280
00:27:43,508 --> 00:27:45,773
this was it.

281
00:28:12,406 --> 00:28:16,365
We didn't leave the apartment
for three whole days after that.

282
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:20,370
We were inseparable by day
and insatiable by night.

283
00:28:20,415 --> 00:28:24,374
Just lived on love
and stale croissants.

284
00:28:24,418 --> 00:28:26,388
She chucked her job.

285
00:28:26,421 --> 00:28:28,889
I couldn't bear
to part with her.

286
00:28:28,925 --> 00:28:31,394
"I'd been granted
a glimpse of heaven...

287
00:28:31,427 --> 00:28:33,725
"then dumped on the sidewalk
of rue d'Assas.

288
00:28:33,763 --> 00:28:35,890
"The gates of paradise
had opened...

289
00:28:35,932 --> 00:28:37,900
"only to slam in my face. "

290
00:28:37,934 --> 00:28:40,334
But they opened again, no?

291
00:28:40,371 --> 00:28:41,894
They sure did, baby.

292
00:28:41,938 --> 00:28:43,907
Pretty wide, at that.

293
00:28:43,941 --> 00:28:45,409
Go on. Don't stop.

294
00:28:45,443 --> 00:28:46,909
That's all there is.

295
00:28:46,944 --> 00:28:50,038
What a pity.
I could listen to you forever.

296
00:29:09,403 --> 00:29:11,563
Bravo! Monsieur a gagn?
un beau p'tit nounours...

297
00:29:11,604 --> 00:29:12,866
pour la p'tite dame.

298
00:29:12,906 --> 00:29:15,874
C'est bravo ca m'sieur!
Un bon tiereur ca!

299
00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:18,878
V'zavez I'choix avec
ce p'tit nounours I?celui-ci!

300
00:29:18,911 --> 00:29:21,677
Y vous plait... celui-ci!

301
00:29:21,716 --> 00:29:23,344
Voil? Celui-ci!

302
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:27,387
Madame prend le plus
beau nounours du stand.

303
00:29:27,421 --> 00:29:28,889
Madame est une connaisseuse...

304
00:29:28,923 --> 00:29:31,016
et monsieur c'est
un bon tireur.

305
00:29:59,457 --> 00:30:01,288
I love you.

306
00:30:01,325 --> 00:30:02,452
What?

307
00:30:02,493 --> 00:30:03,926
You heard me.

308
00:30:03,961 --> 00:30:05,953
You love me?

309
00:33:06,928 --> 00:33:09,362
Isn't it dangerous?

310
00:33:09,398 --> 00:33:12,423
Not if you know
what you're doing.

311
00:33:12,467 --> 00:33:14,934
Why don't you use an electric?

312
00:33:14,969 --> 00:33:17,460
Americans like electric things.

313
00:33:18,473 --> 00:33:20,440
Not this American.

314
00:33:20,475 --> 00:33:24,241
I know. It makes you feel macho.

315
00:33:26,082 --> 00:33:28,447
You're a real tiger.

316
00:33:28,483 --> 00:33:30,452
You think you're Hemingway.

317
00:33:30,486 --> 00:33:32,954
Hemingway had a beard.

318
00:33:32,989 --> 00:33:34,547
Let me try it.

319
00:33:34,591 --> 00:33:37,651
No way. No way!
I value my hide.

320
00:33:37,694 --> 00:33:39,458
Please?

321
00:33:39,495 --> 00:33:42,488
Please.
Please, just one little try.

322
00:33:43,499 --> 00:33:45,969
Who can refuse you anything?

323
00:33:50,307 --> 00:33:51,639
Like this.

324
00:33:53,478 --> 00:33:55,207
Not too much of an angle.

325
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:41,451
Her pussy was a neat,
discreet little cleft...

326
00:34:41,497 --> 00:34:44,466
but as soon
as the animal within...

327
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,959
was roused by my caresses,
it would stir...

328
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:51,462
draw aside the silken curtain
covering its lair...

329
00:34:51,508 --> 00:34:53,976
and become
a carnivorous flower...

330
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,978
a baby's mouth...

331
00:34:56,012 --> 00:34:58,037
greedily sucking my finger.

332
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:02,212
I loved to tease her clitoris
with the tip of my tongue...

333
00:35:02,253 --> 00:35:03,743
and then abandon it...

334
00:35:03,788 --> 00:35:05,415
wet and glistening...

335
00:35:05,457 --> 00:35:09,654
like a little duck dabbling
in a pool of pink flesh.

336
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:16,325
Nigel, come on.
Don't look so shocked.

337
00:35:16,367 --> 00:35:18,166
Steady on, old boy.

338
00:35:18,203 --> 00:35:20,229
I'm only going
into such detail...

339
00:35:20,273 --> 00:35:23,265
to show you how completely
enslaved I was...

340
00:35:23,309 --> 00:35:24,742
body and soul...

341
00:35:24,777 --> 00:35:26,711
by this creature
whose dangerous charms...

342
00:35:26,747 --> 00:35:28,611
have made such an impression
on you.

343
00:35:28,648 --> 00:35:32,880
- Why do you keep saying that?
- You mean I'm mistaken?

344
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,444
All right.

345
00:35:35,489 --> 00:35:38,652
Let it go.
Leave me with my memories.

346
00:35:38,693 --> 00:35:43,756
If it in some way helps you get
it off your chest or something-

347
00:35:43,798 --> 00:35:46,392
What a compassionate fellow
you are, Nigel.

348
00:35:46,433 --> 00:35:48,959
Actually, to tell the truth,
I should be going.

349
00:35:49,003 --> 00:35:51,972
My wife will think
I've fallen overboard.

350
00:35:52,005 --> 00:35:54,474
You'd have made
a very good analyst.

351
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:57,968
Not many men would have listened
to so much for so long.

352
00:36:00,016 --> 00:36:01,983
Well, anyway,
thanks for the drink.

353
00:36:55,075 --> 00:36:57,909
I can't understand why he'd
think you'd be interested...

354
00:36:57,945 --> 00:36:59,412
in all these sordid details.

355
00:36:59,446 --> 00:37:00,573
I haven't a clue.

356
00:37:00,615 --> 00:37:01,775
Probably lets his hair down...

357
00:37:01,817 --> 00:37:04,182
every time he corners
a captive audience, poor chap.

358
00:37:04,219 --> 00:37:07,416
Poor chap.
He's a verbal exhibitionist.

359
00:37:07,455 --> 00:37:09,423
It's his wife I feel sorry for.

360
00:37:09,457 --> 00:37:12,427
Yeah. Did I mention I met her
in the bar last night?

361
00:37:12,461 --> 00:37:14,690
- No.
- No, I didn't, did I?

362
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:17,790
- Was she feeling better?
- Yeah, much better.

363
00:37:17,834 --> 00:37:20,325
She's not bad-looking, actually.

364
00:37:22,973 --> 00:37:24,234
Thank you.

365
00:37:24,273 --> 00:37:25,433
They're coming.

366
00:37:25,474 --> 00:37:26,806
What?

367
00:37:26,843 --> 00:37:28,904
Your American friend
and his wife.

368
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,080
God. Just as long as he
doesn't park himself on us.

369
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,518
After what he
told you last night?

370
00:37:36,553 --> 00:37:37,851
He wouldn't dare, would he?

371
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:40,949
Nigel, old chap.
Good to see you.

372
00:37:40,993 --> 00:37:43,222
This must be
your lovely wife.

373
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:46,424
Hi there, I'm Oscar. Mimi
you already know, don't you?

374
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:49,794
So do you, Nigel, right?

375
00:37:51,036 --> 00:37:52,628
I hate to break up a twosome...

376
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:54,332
but would you mind
if I joined you?

377
00:37:54,373 --> 00:37:56,808
We had an invitation
to the Captain's table.

378
00:37:56,843 --> 00:37:58,742
Trouble is,
I'm allergic to beards.

379
00:37:58,778 --> 00:38:00,642
Are you allergic to cripples?

380
00:38:02,282 --> 00:38:04,580
After an intro like that,
how can we refuse?

381
00:38:04,618 --> 00:38:06,085
Fine. It's settled, then.

382
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:07,587
Off you go, baby.

383
00:38:07,621 --> 00:38:10,557
Thanks. Have fun.

384
00:38:10,591 --> 00:38:13,253
Mimi doesn't share my aversion.

385
00:38:13,294 --> 00:38:16,263
In fact,
she's not too choosy in general.

386
00:38:16,297 --> 00:38:18,628
Can't be, or she couldn't
have married me.

387
00:38:20,701 --> 00:38:23,500
What a girl.

388
00:38:23,537 --> 00:38:25,438
Knockin' 'em dead as usual.

389
00:38:25,474 --> 00:38:27,443
Just wine for me. White.

390
00:38:27,476 --> 00:38:31,071
Anything,
as long as it's not retsina.

391
00:38:31,113 --> 00:38:33,980
Yes, Mimi's very lovely,
but you...

392
00:38:34,017 --> 00:38:35,814
I still don't know your name,
by the way.

393
00:38:35,852 --> 00:38:36,978
Fiona.

394
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:39,454
Fiona. I hope you won't
think me forward...

395
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:42,584
but I find your own brand
of beauty more subtle.

396
00:38:42,626 --> 00:38:44,526
It has that inimitably
British quality...

397
00:38:44,562 --> 00:38:48,463
a kind of reticence that hints
at untapped potentiality.

398
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:52,128
Nigel's been tapping
my potentialities for years...

399
00:38:52,169 --> 00:38:53,467
haven't you, Nigel?

400
00:38:53,504 --> 00:38:54,938
Well, Nigel?

401
00:38:56,507 --> 00:38:59,238
Come on, your lovely wife
has just implied...

402
00:38:59,276 --> 00:39:01,609
that she's lost
all her mystery for you.

403
00:39:01,645 --> 00:39:03,171
True or false?

404
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,376
I think there's probably
a corner of everyone...

405
00:39:05,418 --> 00:39:06,612
that remains to be explored.

406
00:39:08,654 --> 00:39:11,919
Halfhearted,
but better than nothing.

407
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:14,449
Well, Fiona, they'll
have to make do with that.

408
00:39:14,494 --> 00:39:18,362
He's right, though. Everyone
has secret nooks and crannies.

409
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,422
Every relationship,
no matter how harmonious...

410
00:39:20,466 --> 00:39:23,459
contains seeds of farce
or tragedy.

411
00:39:30,745 --> 00:39:32,439
I do not like
the look of that sky.

412
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,812
I'm not sure if the weather's
going to hold.

413
00:39:33,848 --> 00:39:36,715
Jesus, don't tell me you're
taking refuge in the weather.

414
00:39:36,752 --> 00:39:38,218
You know what I hope?

415
00:39:38,252 --> 00:39:39,686
I hope the ship goes down...

416
00:39:39,721 --> 00:39:41,747
and we're all marooned
on a desert island.

417
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,315
I'd wind up
the sole survivor.

418
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,418
That's charming.
And why do you say that?

419
00:39:45,462 --> 00:39:47,122
Because
no one would be tempted...

420
00:39:47,162 --> 00:39:49,427
to cannibalize
my shriveled carcass.

421
00:40:08,352 --> 00:40:10,651
I hope he hasn't
been boring you.

422
00:40:10,688 --> 00:40:12,155
No, not at all.

423
00:40:12,189 --> 00:40:13,918
Your husband
has a great sense of humor.

424
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:16,483
Black humor, but still,
he's been keeping us...

425
00:40:16,528 --> 00:40:17,495
thoroughly entertained.

426
00:40:17,529 --> 00:40:19,498
- See, baby?
- See what?

427
00:40:19,532 --> 00:40:21,328
Our British friends
find me entertaining.

428
00:40:21,367 --> 00:40:23,528
In small doses, perhaps.

429
00:40:23,568 --> 00:40:26,265
But now we must leave them
in peace.

430
00:40:26,305 --> 00:40:28,569
Ah. Indeed.

431
00:40:28,608 --> 00:40:30,508
Thanks for taking care of him.

432
00:40:30,543 --> 00:40:32,477
Not at all.

433
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:35,811
Ah, Fiona, I've already
imposed on you...

434
00:40:35,848 --> 00:40:37,783
but may I beg a favor?

435
00:40:37,819 --> 00:40:39,217
As I'm sure he told you...

436
00:40:39,253 --> 00:40:41,347
Nigel and I
had a chat last night.

437
00:40:41,389 --> 00:40:44,324
I found him
such stimulating company.

438
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:46,554
Could I borrow him again
this afternoon?

439
00:40:46,593 --> 00:40:48,322
Just for an hour or so.

440
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,991
He's quite grown up. He doesn't
have to have Mummy's permission.

441
00:41:03,512 --> 00:41:05,481
The seasons came and went.

442
00:41:05,514 --> 00:41:09,383
Mimi's face still held
a thousand mysteries for me...

443
00:41:09,418 --> 00:41:12,979
her body
a thousand sweet promises.

444
00:41:13,022 --> 00:41:15,049
But lurking
at the back of my mind...

445
00:41:15,093 --> 00:41:18,187
was an unspoken fear that we'd
already scaled the heights...

446
00:41:18,229 --> 00:41:19,992
of our relationship...

447
00:41:20,031 --> 00:41:23,000
that it would all be downhill
from now on.

448
00:41:23,033 --> 00:41:25,025
And then something happened.

449
00:41:26,871 --> 00:41:30,774
Something that would put things
on a totally different plane.

450
00:41:33,046 --> 00:41:36,913
We were at Kitzbuhel,
a skiing vacation.

451
00:41:36,949 --> 00:41:38,918
I'd rented a chalet there.

452
00:41:38,951 --> 00:41:41,284
It was one of those nights-

453
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,811
warm and cozy inside...

454
00:41:43,857 --> 00:41:46,053
great, fat snowflakes...

455
00:41:46,091 --> 00:41:50,028
drifting down in the blackness
beyond the frosted panes.

456
00:41:50,063 --> 00:41:53,522
No light but the glow
from the set.

457
00:41:53,567 --> 00:41:56,365
Mimi on the floor wearing
a T-shirt and nothing else...

458
00:41:56,403 --> 00:42:00,898
watching some old American soap
dubbed in German...

459
00:42:00,941 --> 00:42:03,376
and me on the couch
watching her...

460
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:06,380
sprawled in a sort
of boozy stupor.

461
00:42:06,414 --> 00:42:08,405
All at once she got up...

462
00:42:10,253 --> 00:42:13,120
stalked over to the set...

463
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:15,954
spread her legs...

464
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:18,051
and pissed on the screen...

465
00:42:18,094 --> 00:42:20,995
like she wanted to blot it out.

466
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:25,161
Time stood still for an instant,
and then I rolled off the couch.

467
00:42:25,201 --> 00:42:27,328
I crawled over like a lunatic.

468
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,737
I wormed my way
between her legs...

469
00:42:29,773 --> 00:42:31,708
and I turned over.

470
00:42:31,743 --> 00:42:32,902
And right away...

471
00:42:32,943 --> 00:42:38,472
I was engulfed with this warm,
golden cascade.

472
00:42:38,516 --> 00:42:40,916
It spattered my cheeks...

473
00:42:40,952 --> 00:42:43,853
it filled my nostrils,
it stung my eyes...

474
00:42:43,888 --> 00:42:47,016
and then something
jolted my brain...

475
00:42:47,058 --> 00:42:50,289
with multi-megavolt intensity.

476
00:42:50,329 --> 00:42:55,199
There was this blinding flash
in the back of my eyeballs.

477
00:42:55,234 --> 00:42:58,260
I experienced
the orgasm of a lifetime.

478
00:42:58,305 --> 00:43:00,330
For God's sake, man!

479
00:43:00,372 --> 00:43:03,900
It was like a white-hot blade
piercing me through and through.

480
00:43:03,943 --> 00:43:06,914
This was my Nile,
my Ganges, my Jordan...

481
00:43:06,947 --> 00:43:09,212
my Fountain of Youth,
my second baptism.

482
00:43:09,249 --> 00:43:11,649
I think I'm probably
as broad-minded...

483
00:43:11,685 --> 00:43:14,314
as the next man...
but, I mean, obviously...

484
00:43:14,355 --> 00:43:15,447
there are limits.

485
00:43:15,488 --> 00:43:16,979
Stop twittering, Nigel.

486
00:43:17,024 --> 00:43:20,483
I'm sharing a revelation
with you, damn it.

487
00:43:20,529 --> 00:43:22,962
I'm trying to expand
your sexual horizons.

488
00:43:22,997 --> 00:43:25,058
I see. And what makes you
think they need expanding?

489
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:29,503
I'm sure your tumbles with Fiona
are all perfectly adequate...

490
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:31,905
very sanitary and hygienic
in their way.

491
00:43:31,941 --> 00:43:34,842
You bloody well
leave us out of this.

492
00:43:34,877 --> 00:43:37,003
At least we've got some decency.

493
00:43:37,046 --> 00:43:39,014
What do you think
you're doing...

494
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:42,017
sharing the details
of your perverted sex life...

495
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:43,450
with a total stranger?

496
00:43:43,486 --> 00:43:44,921
It's just downright obscene.

497
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,115
Obscene?

498
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:49,523
Have you ever felt real,
overpowering passion?

499
00:43:49,561 --> 00:43:52,325
Have you ever truly
idolized a woman?

500
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:55,025
Nothing can be obscene
in such a love.

501
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:57,159
Everything that occurs
between you...

502
00:43:57,202 --> 00:43:59,500
becomes a sacrament,
don't you see?

503
00:44:01,573 --> 00:44:02,973
Come on. Sit down.

504
00:44:03,009 --> 00:44:05,409
Have another cup of tea.

505
00:44:05,444 --> 00:44:07,071
It'll steady your nerves.

506
00:44:10,016 --> 00:44:13,543
So, anyway...

507
00:44:13,586 --> 00:44:16,384
that was our sexual Rubicon.

508
00:44:16,422 --> 00:44:20,017
It opened up all sorts
of new possibilities.

509
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:03,267
I always had a suspicion...

510
00:45:03,307 --> 00:45:05,467
it might be
supremely pleasurable...

511
00:45:05,509 --> 00:45:09,969
to be humiliated
by a beautiful woman...

512
00:45:10,014 --> 00:45:13,212
but it was only now
I realized...

513
00:45:13,251 --> 00:45:15,445
what this could entail.

514
00:47:22,025 --> 00:47:26,324
We shut ourselves up with
our toys for weeks on end...

515
00:47:26,362 --> 00:47:27,990
never going out...

516
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:30,795
seeing no one but each other.

517
00:47:30,835 --> 00:47:33,997
I guess it was asking
too much of any couple.

518
00:47:34,038 --> 00:47:35,197
Oscar?

519
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:36,434
Just a minute.

520
00:47:37,641 --> 00:47:40,372
Did you really have
all those women?

521
00:47:40,411 --> 00:47:42,003
What women?

522
00:47:42,045 --> 00:47:44,105
The ones you write about.

523
00:47:46,552 --> 00:47:48,019
Does it matter?

524
00:47:48,053 --> 00:47:50,021
It's a book, for Christ's sake.

525
00:47:50,055 --> 00:47:51,522
I know. I'm just curious.

526
00:47:51,557 --> 00:47:54,526
Do you like it?
That's what matters.

527
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,424
It's very sexy.

528
00:47:56,462 --> 00:47:59,488
Forget about sex
for two seconds.

529
00:47:59,532 --> 00:48:01,898
What do you think of the quality
of the writing?

530
00:48:01,934 --> 00:48:04,994
I can't judge.
My English isn't good enough.

531
00:48:05,037 --> 00:48:07,007
"My English isn't good enough. "

532
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,009
Why read the fucking book
at all?

533
00:48:09,042 --> 00:48:10,476
Because I love you.

534
00:48:10,511 --> 00:48:13,071
Because I love everything
to do with you.

535
00:48:13,114 --> 00:48:15,479
It's a pity
you're not in publishing.

536
00:48:15,516 --> 00:48:18,974
I'd be at the top
of the best-seller list by now.

537
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,215
When will it be published?

538
00:48:21,255 --> 00:48:22,688
You tell me.

539
00:48:23,824 --> 00:48:25,918
I'm working on it.

540
00:48:25,962 --> 00:48:29,658
We were getting to be
like two goldfish in a bowl.

541
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:32,826
"Come on," I told her,
"We need a change of scene.

542
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:35,837
"Let's each round up
a few friends and hit the town. "

543
00:49:04,971 --> 00:49:09,270
You know it.
It's true. It's true.

544
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:24,012
Hey, what's the matter?

545
00:50:29,095 --> 00:50:31,063
I'd always found infidelity...

546
00:50:31,097 --> 00:50:34,930
the most titillating aspect
of any relationship.

547
00:50:34,967 --> 00:50:38,335
That scene
should have turned me on.

548
00:50:38,372 --> 00:50:41,307
So why didn't it?

549
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,572
Why did I feel so hurt?

550
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:48,039
Pas de cigarette,
s'il vous plait.

551
00:51:14,878 --> 00:51:17,006
Why did you do it?

552
00:51:21,251 --> 00:51:23,948
Why don't you say something?

553
00:51:23,987 --> 00:51:25,478
What do you want me to say?

554
00:51:25,523 --> 00:51:28,549
Why did you walk out on me
like that?

555
00:51:28,593 --> 00:51:30,059
You don't know?

556
00:51:30,094 --> 00:51:31,891
Well, you started it.

557
00:51:31,929 --> 00:51:34,421
Flirting with my own roommate.

558
00:51:34,467 --> 00:51:36,093
You were all over her.

559
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:38,365
Bullshit. We were having
a couple laughs.

560
00:51:38,404 --> 00:51:39,894
And we were just having a dance.

561
00:51:39,938 --> 00:51:44,068
Some dance. Decent of you
not to fuck him on the floor.

562
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:47,374
I'm sorry.
I did it because I was jealous.

563
00:51:47,413 --> 00:51:49,573
Please, please forgive me.

564
00:51:49,616 --> 00:51:51,083
You're my Tiger.

565
00:51:51,117 --> 00:51:53,916
I don't want anyone but you...

566
00:51:53,954 --> 00:51:55,751
not ever.

567
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:59,624
I love you. I love you.

568
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:04,154
I loved her, too,
but our credit was running out.

569
00:52:04,198 --> 00:52:06,996
We were headed
for sexual bankruptcy.

570
00:52:20,283 --> 00:52:22,751
I smell pig.

571
00:52:27,089 --> 00:52:28,214
Don't laugh.

572
00:52:28,257 --> 00:52:29,816
Don't talk.

573
00:52:29,861 --> 00:52:32,625
Come, piggy.

574
00:52:32,663 --> 00:52:34,722
Where is he?

575
00:52:34,765 --> 00:52:37,233
Come, piggy-wiggy.

576
00:52:38,837 --> 00:52:40,736
Where are you?

577
00:52:53,452 --> 00:52:55,784
Get off. Get off.

578
00:52:57,122 --> 00:53:01,491
How dare you try to fuck me,
you filthy beast!

579
00:53:01,526 --> 00:53:02,653
Take that.

580
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:10,033
Harder.

581
00:53:10,071 --> 00:53:11,230
Shut up.

582
00:53:13,573 --> 00:53:16,236
Oh, you spoiled it.

583
00:53:17,578 --> 00:53:19,045
Pigs don't talk.

584
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,742
How can I believe
in a pig that talks?

585
00:53:27,256 --> 00:53:28,746
You know something?

586
00:53:30,593 --> 00:53:33,084
I don't believe in it, either.

587
00:53:34,597 --> 00:53:36,086
Not anymore.

588
00:53:45,042 --> 00:53:46,704
That was it.

589
00:53:46,744 --> 00:53:48,905
The spell was broken at last.

590
00:53:48,946 --> 00:53:51,710
Jolly good thing, too,
if you ask me.

591
00:53:51,749 --> 00:53:53,876
I dread to think
what you'd get up to next.

592
00:53:53,918 --> 00:53:57,410
Don't worry.
There's plenty more to tell.

593
00:53:57,454 --> 00:53:59,684
What makes you think
I want to hear it?

594
00:53:59,723 --> 00:54:01,851
I still don't know
what gives you the idea...

595
00:54:01,893 --> 00:54:03,884
that I enjoy being used
as a rubbish dump...

596
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:05,227
for your unsavory reminiscences.

597
00:54:05,264 --> 00:54:07,494
Don't you?

598
00:54:07,533 --> 00:54:09,433
Don't you really, Nigel?

599
00:54:13,406 --> 00:54:15,033
He's still here?

600
00:54:15,074 --> 00:54:19,909
Afraid I am, yes,
but I'm just off now.

601
00:54:19,946 --> 00:54:24,384
You know, Nigel has been
extremely patient with me.

602
00:54:24,418 --> 00:54:28,287
We don't see eye-to-eye
on everything...

603
00:54:28,322 --> 00:54:31,553
but we share at least
one interest in common...

604
00:54:31,592 --> 00:54:33,024
you, baby.

605
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:37,794
I suppose that's why he
keeps coming back for more.

606
00:54:37,832 --> 00:54:40,631
Anyway, as I say, I'm just off.

607
00:54:40,669 --> 00:54:43,000
So, thanks very much
for the tea.

608
00:54:43,038 --> 00:54:44,266
Toodle-oo.

609
00:55:04,061 --> 00:55:05,187
Oh. Sorry.

610
00:55:05,228 --> 00:55:07,026
You were gone long enough.

611
00:55:07,063 --> 00:55:08,531
I'm really sorry, darling.

612
00:55:08,566 --> 00:55:10,533
I was going to go to dinner
without you.

613
00:55:10,568 --> 00:55:12,365
It's just incredibly hard
to get away.

614
00:55:12,404 --> 00:55:14,098
You saw what he's like.

615
00:55:14,138 --> 00:55:17,164
- Was she there, too?
- Who?

616
00:55:17,208 --> 00:55:18,335
Wrong answer, Nigel.

617
00:55:18,378 --> 00:55:20,709
"Yes" or "no" would have
been fine, but "who?"

618
00:55:20,747 --> 00:55:22,737
You know perfectly well
who I mean.

619
00:55:22,781 --> 00:55:27,185
Right, Mimi. Yeah, she rolled up
just as I was leaving.

620
00:55:27,219 --> 00:55:28,379
Odd creature.

621
00:55:28,421 --> 00:55:31,049
So you said-
"Odd, but not bad-looking. "

622
00:55:31,089 --> 00:55:32,557
Most men would find her
stunning.

623
00:55:32,592 --> 00:55:34,082
Most women, too,
for that matter.

624
00:55:34,126 --> 00:55:37,563
Well, look, I am not "most men. "

625
00:55:37,598 --> 00:55:41,056
I'm your husband. Right?

626
00:55:41,101 --> 00:55:42,568
There we go.

627
00:55:42,603 --> 00:55:45,835
Here they are, all locked up.

628
00:55:45,873 --> 00:55:47,569
I say,
is this your little girl?

629
00:55:47,608 --> 00:55:50,076
It is, indeed. Amrita, say hello
to the lady and gentleman.

630
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:51,577
Hello, Amrita.
That's a very pretty name.

631
00:55:51,613 --> 00:55:53,171
It's almost as pretty
as you are.

632
00:55:53,213 --> 00:55:56,082
She's enchanting.
Where have you been hiding her?

633
00:55:56,117 --> 00:55:58,086
I have a nanny
that looks after her.

634
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,850
- And your wife?
- I'm a widower, dear lady.

635
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:02,858
Oh, I'm so sorry.

636
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:05,519
Anyway, it's lovely
to have a child on board.

637
00:56:05,561 --> 00:56:08,028
It makes a change
from all the wrinklies.

638
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:11,033
And you? Have you provided
for your posterity?

639
00:56:11,066 --> 00:56:12,193
Sorry?

640
00:56:12,234 --> 00:56:14,099
You have a wife
that loves children so much.

641
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:16,333
I was just wondering if
you yourself have a family.

642
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,204
No, we haven't, actually.

643
00:56:18,242 --> 00:56:20,710
No. Nigel thinks the world's
overpopulated enough as it is...

644
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:23,212
without us adding
to the problem.

645
00:56:23,246 --> 00:56:25,715
An admirable sentiment in India,
perhaps...

646
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,741
But surely the green fields
of England...

647
00:56:27,785 --> 00:56:30,720
can afford to have
a few more mouths to feed.

648
00:56:30,755 --> 00:56:32,553
I say, look at that.

649
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:34,058
Oh, look, Amrita, look. See.

650
00:56:34,093 --> 00:56:36,391
- Isn't that beautiful?
- Are you cold, darling?

651
00:56:36,428 --> 00:56:38,896
Gosh,
I should have brought my coat.

652
00:56:38,931 --> 00:56:41,230
Please, allow me.

653
00:56:41,267 --> 00:56:42,563
That's very kind.

654
00:56:42,601 --> 00:56:44,092
- Here we are.
- Thank you.

655
00:56:45,438 --> 00:56:47,769
Let's go and I'll fetch you
something from the cabin.

656
00:56:47,807 --> 00:56:49,467
See you in a sec.

657
00:56:51,244 --> 00:56:53,042
Believe me, dear lady...

658
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,708
children are a better
form of marital therapy...

659
00:56:55,749 --> 00:56:57,409
than any trip to India.

660
00:57:10,433 --> 00:57:12,731
You mustn't believe all he says.

661
00:57:12,767 --> 00:57:14,759
He's a sick man.

662
00:57:14,804 --> 00:57:16,270
He imagines things.

663
00:57:20,743 --> 00:57:23,405
Please, don't think badly of me.

664
00:57:25,413 --> 00:57:26,813
Now, wait a minute.

665
00:57:26,849 --> 00:57:29,148
What are you playing at
this time?

666
00:57:29,186 --> 00:57:32,645
It matters to me what you think.

667
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:33,917
Does it?

668
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:36,826
Does it really?

669
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:39,329
I have to talk with you, Nigel.

670
00:57:39,364 --> 00:57:41,456
I have to explain.

671
00:57:42,766 --> 00:57:45,132
All right, go ahead.

672
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,636
No. Not here.

673
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:48,139
In my cabin.

674
00:57:48,174 --> 00:57:51,302
We won't be disturbed there.

675
00:57:51,343 --> 00:57:52,503
Please.

676
00:57:52,545 --> 00:57:56,811
I'm afraid I can't. Not now.

677
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:58,476
No. Later.

678
00:57:58,517 --> 00:58:00,577
Five o'clock.

679
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:02,610
Cabin DS1.

680
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:17,560
What is it?

681
00:58:20,575 --> 00:58:21,906
A newspaper.

682
00:58:23,077 --> 00:58:24,544
I brought your coat.

683
00:58:24,579 --> 00:58:26,046
Thanks, Mr. Singh.

684
00:58:26,081 --> 00:58:27,276
You're very welcome.

685
00:58:29,651 --> 00:58:31,881
- What a lovely story.
- Thanks.

686
00:58:31,919 --> 00:58:33,445
Say thank you, Amrita.

687
00:58:33,489 --> 00:58:35,217
So if your daddy will let me
I'll come and tell you...

688
00:58:35,257 --> 00:58:38,090
some other stories sometime.
Would you like that?

689
00:58:39,162 --> 00:58:41,061
Two hearts.

690
00:58:41,096 --> 00:58:42,928
I pass.

691
00:58:44,434 --> 00:58:46,062
Four hearts.

692
00:58:46,103 --> 00:58:47,569
Ich passe.

693
00:58:47,605 --> 00:58:48,731
No bid.

694
00:58:48,772 --> 00:58:49,931
Pass.

695
00:59:11,896 --> 00:59:13,364
You won't believe this...

696
00:59:13,398 --> 00:59:16,197
but I've got to see
that chap again.

697
00:59:16,235 --> 00:59:18,703
I thought you'd had enough
of all that.

698
00:59:18,738 --> 00:59:23,040
I know, it's just...
he won't take no for an answer.

699
00:59:23,076 --> 00:59:26,534
I'm so sorry,
but I've simply got to go.

700
00:59:26,579 --> 00:59:29,845
I wonder, would you like
to take my place?

701
00:59:29,882 --> 00:59:31,818
- I should be delighted.
- Great.

702
00:59:31,853 --> 00:59:33,717
Bridge is king of games.

703
00:59:33,755 --> 00:59:36,723
I once played
forty-eight hours nonstop.

704
00:59:36,758 --> 00:59:39,226
You leave your partner
in safe hands.

705
00:59:39,259 --> 00:59:40,728
Excellent.
I do apologize.

706
00:59:40,763 --> 00:59:42,229
Please, excuse me.

707
00:59:42,264 --> 00:59:44,232
Entschuldigung and all that.

708
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:23,031
May I come in?

709
01:00:31,049 --> 01:00:32,950
Close the door.

710
01:00:56,411 --> 01:00:58,675
April Fool!

711
01:01:03,052 --> 01:01:05,452
You pathetic, sick...

712
01:01:08,424 --> 01:01:10,483
Do you want her?

713
01:01:10,526 --> 01:01:12,188
Yes or no.

714
01:01:12,228 --> 01:01:15,255
I don't want anything more to do
with either of you, ever.

715
01:01:15,299 --> 01:01:17,790
Let go.
Let me go, or I'll-

716
01:01:17,834 --> 01:01:20,860
Let me go
or I'll call my mommy.

717
01:01:20,904 --> 01:01:23,372
Go on.

718
01:01:23,407 --> 01:01:25,205
Get out.

719
01:01:25,243 --> 01:01:28,076
Crawl back
to your matrimonial tomb.

720
01:01:34,253 --> 01:01:36,721
You know what? I pity you.

721
01:01:36,755 --> 01:01:38,689
I genuinely pity you both...

722
01:01:38,724 --> 01:01:41,124
if this is how
you get your kicks.

723
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,685
I get no kicks out of this.

724
01:01:43,729 --> 01:01:45,629
Then what was this farce?

725
01:01:45,664 --> 01:01:48,155
How else could we get you here?

726
01:01:51,171 --> 01:01:54,630
Why is that suddenly
of such incredible importance?

727
01:01:54,675 --> 01:01:58,076
Mimi wants you to hear
the rest of our story.

728
01:01:58,112 --> 01:02:01,206
She thinks it'll help
her chances with you.

729
01:02:01,248 --> 01:02:03,409
What are you, her pimp?

730
01:02:03,451 --> 01:02:05,851
I don't begrudge Mimi
the right to look elsewhere...

731
01:02:05,886 --> 01:02:08,912
for what I can no longer supply.

732
01:02:08,956 --> 01:02:12,415
I merely supervise her affairs
instead of...

733
01:02:12,461 --> 01:02:13,929
submitting to them.

734
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:17,929
You can have her, Nigel...

735
01:02:17,966 --> 01:02:19,434
with my blessings.

736
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:22,233
On one condition-

737
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:23,602
you hear me out.

738
01:02:28,979 --> 01:02:30,606
You make me sick.

739
01:02:30,647 --> 01:02:32,638
Why are you still standing here?

740
01:02:34,151 --> 01:02:37,552
Come on, Nigel, it was a joke.

741
01:02:37,588 --> 01:02:40,716
Have a sense of humor,
for Christ's sake.

742
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,054
Come on, sit down.

743
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:43,650
Make yourself comfortable.

744
01:02:43,694 --> 01:02:44,923
Use my wheelchair.

745
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:55,931
The brake! The brake!

746
01:03:01,212 --> 01:03:03,147
Have a heart, Nigel.

747
01:03:07,153 --> 01:03:08,620
Don't be too rough...

748
01:03:08,656 --> 01:03:12,387
on a man demolished
by a love that was too strong.

749
01:03:18,632 --> 01:03:20,601
Yes, sir.

750
01:03:20,634 --> 01:03:23,069
We should have
stopped right there.

751
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:29,236
Lovers should quit when
their passion is at its peak...

752
01:03:29,278 --> 01:03:32,611
not wait until
its inevitable decline.

753
01:03:38,854 --> 01:03:43,348
As it was, my desire for her
had begun to wane.

754
01:03:45,529 --> 01:03:47,156
There she would lie-

755
01:03:47,197 --> 01:03:50,393
gorgeous, voluptuous...

756
01:03:50,434 --> 01:03:53,426
and it didn't do a thing for me.

757
01:03:53,470 --> 01:03:56,337
I came to resent her failure
to excite me...

758
01:03:56,373 --> 01:03:58,035
the way she used to.

759
01:04:05,183 --> 01:04:09,813
We were developing a narcotic
dependence on television...

760
01:04:09,855 --> 01:04:13,620
the marital aid that enables
a couple to endure each other...

761
01:04:13,659 --> 01:04:15,991
without having to talk.

762
01:04:26,607 --> 01:04:29,599
A New York editress
was overnighting in Paris...

763
01:04:29,643 --> 01:04:31,702
on her way
to the Frankfurt book fair.

764
01:04:31,746 --> 01:04:34,306
I wanted to show her
a good time.

765
01:04:34,349 --> 01:04:35,975
It was a PR job...

766
01:04:36,017 --> 01:04:38,985
and I was apprehensive
of her reaction to Mimi...

767
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:42,286
who tended to upstage
every other woman in sight.

768
01:04:42,324 --> 01:04:43,484
You wearing that?

769
01:04:44,526 --> 01:04:45,652
That dress?

770
01:04:45,693 --> 01:04:47,025
What about it?

771
01:04:48,964 --> 01:04:50,522
Couldn't you wear
something else?

772
01:04:53,368 --> 01:04:54,666
What's wrong with it?

773
01:04:54,703 --> 01:04:56,637
Oh, nothing.

774
01:04:56,671 --> 01:04:58,471
What do you mean, nothing?

775
01:05:00,243 --> 01:05:04,510
You think it makes me look fat,
it makes my ass look fat.

776
01:05:04,547 --> 01:05:06,174
Did I say that?

777
01:05:06,217 --> 01:05:09,708
- You think I've got a fat ass.
- You said that. I didn't.

778
01:05:09,753 --> 01:05:12,221
So you do think
I've got a fat ass.

779
01:05:12,255 --> 01:05:13,985
Give me a break.

780
01:05:14,025 --> 01:05:16,960
You wouldn't have said that
once upon a time.

781
01:05:16,994 --> 01:05:18,291
You liked my ass.

782
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:22,494
I still like your ass.
I'm crazy about your ass.

783
01:05:22,534 --> 01:05:24,126
You don't love me anymore.

784
01:05:24,169 --> 01:05:26,194
Wear what you fucking want.

785
01:05:26,238 --> 01:05:29,173
Wear a fucking bathrobe,
for all I care.

786
01:05:37,117 --> 01:05:40,143
The trouble is, publishing
isn't what it used to be.

787
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:42,087
It's the bottom line
that counts now...

788
01:05:42,123 --> 01:05:44,920
proven track records,
advance sales.

789
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:46,118
No one's gonna invest
in a newcomer...

790
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,388
who hasn't proven himself.

791
01:05:47,429 --> 01:05:50,489
So an unknown can't get
published unless he's known.

792
01:05:50,531 --> 01:05:52,294
Sounds like a Catch-22 to me.

793
01:05:52,332 --> 01:05:54,130
You could call it that.

794
01:05:54,168 --> 01:05:56,331
And your Parisian settings
don't help any.

795
01:05:56,371 --> 01:05:57,770
When are you
going to come back home...

796
01:05:57,806 --> 01:05:59,274
back to the United States,
where it's at?

797
01:05:59,307 --> 01:06:00,797
No, he wouldn't do that.

798
01:06:00,842 --> 01:06:03,437
Oscar's a fixture here.
He's like the Eiffel Tower.

799
01:06:03,479 --> 01:06:05,742
He's right, Beverly.
I love it here.

800
01:06:05,781 --> 01:06:08,214
- I feel at home.
- Good for you.

801
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:11,276
Come on, get a life.
Paris is out. Vieux jeu.

802
01:06:11,319 --> 01:06:12,752
It's a literary mausoleum.

803
01:06:12,787 --> 01:06:15,849
Henry Miller
used it up fifty years ago.

804
01:06:15,891 --> 01:06:17,416
God, I don't think France
hasn't been the same...

805
01:06:17,462 --> 01:06:19,793
since they gave up absinthe.

806
01:06:21,565 --> 01:06:24,296
It's all right.
I'll be fine. Thank you.

807
01:06:24,335 --> 01:06:26,529
I'm fine. I'm fine.

808
01:06:28,739 --> 01:06:32,734
You know what?
I should make you my agent.

809
01:06:32,778 --> 01:06:34,803
That would solve
all my problems.

810
01:06:34,846 --> 01:06:36,974
"Paris is out. Vieux jeu. "

811
01:06:37,015 --> 01:06:40,280
You really did me
some good tonight...

812
01:06:40,318 --> 01:06:42,311
like I don't have enough trouble
getting published.

813
01:06:42,354 --> 01:06:44,481
I couldn't bear to see you
crawl up her ass like that.

814
01:06:44,523 --> 01:06:47,117
I'll crawl up the ass of anyone
I fucking well feel like.

815
01:06:47,159 --> 01:06:48,683
Yours isn't the only one
in town.

816
01:06:48,728 --> 01:06:50,889
Is that how you feel?

817
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:52,330
That's exactly how I feel.

818
01:06:52,366 --> 01:06:54,333
In that case, I'd better go.

819
01:06:54,368 --> 01:06:55,994
OK. You do that.

820
01:07:31,041 --> 01:07:32,405
I'm going now.

821
01:07:35,344 --> 01:07:37,006
Are you sad I'm going?

822
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:41,111
You're not sad.

823
01:07:42,686 --> 01:07:46,053
I am sad,
but it's better this way.

824
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:08,938
My keys.

825
01:08:08,981 --> 01:08:10,142
Thanks.

826
01:08:13,987 --> 01:08:16,012
I love you.
I love you so much.

827
01:08:16,057 --> 01:08:19,219
Please don't make me go.

828
01:08:24,666 --> 01:08:26,156
Stop crying.

829
01:08:28,503 --> 01:08:30,664
Go make some coffee
or something, huh?

830
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:04,870
I came to dread bedtime.

831
01:09:07,646 --> 01:09:09,774
I would feel this...

832
01:09:09,815 --> 01:09:12,875
overpowering desire to sleep.

833
01:09:15,721 --> 01:09:17,187
I'm bushed.

834
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:29,135
I'd feel sorry for her...

835
01:09:29,169 --> 01:09:30,636
Good night.

836
01:09:30,672 --> 01:09:33,799
...lying there with her belly
crying, "Famine... "

837
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:36,365
her organs in turmoil.

838
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:38,071
Kiss me good night.

839
01:09:46,221 --> 01:09:49,019
Not like that. Hold me.

840
01:09:49,058 --> 01:09:51,151
I would crush my lips
against hers...

841
01:09:51,193 --> 01:09:54,651
like you mash out a butt
in an ashtray...

842
01:09:54,697 --> 01:09:56,255
but that was only a prelude...

843
01:09:56,297 --> 01:09:59,325
to the most unoriginal act
known to man-

844
01:09:59,369 --> 01:10:02,770
the process referred to
as copulation.

845
01:10:10,381 --> 01:10:13,544
I felt like a rat in a trap.

846
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:16,451
Out there,
people were having fun-

847
01:10:16,487 --> 01:10:19,480
dancing, making love.

848
01:10:19,524 --> 01:10:22,652
Paris was throbbing
to its own frenetic rhythms.

849
01:10:22,695 --> 01:10:25,959
They pounded away in my head,
driving me crazy.

850
01:10:27,366 --> 01:10:28,799
I craved variety.

851
01:10:28,835 --> 01:10:32,168
I hungered for noise
and excitement.

852
01:11:23,727 --> 01:11:25,354
Holy shit!

853
01:11:33,739 --> 01:11:36,207
Do you have to drink it
that way?

854
01:11:36,241 --> 01:11:38,539
Why can't you use a glass?

855
01:11:38,577 --> 01:11:41,044
What's the difference?
It tastes the same.

856
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:43,047
It doesn't look the same.

857
01:11:43,082 --> 01:11:45,710
Oh-la-la. I didn't know
you were so delicate.

858
01:11:45,752 --> 01:11:48,311
- What do you mean, delicate?
- I mean delicate.

859
01:11:48,353 --> 01:11:49,479
I know what you mean...

860
01:11:49,521 --> 01:11:51,217
but it's just not
the right word in English.

861
01:11:51,258 --> 01:11:53,521
If you don't know the right word
in English, say it in French.

862
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:56,529
I don't say it in French because
your French isn't good enough.

863
01:11:56,564 --> 01:11:58,827
It's better than your English.

864
01:11:58,865 --> 01:12:02,802
After all these years in Paris,
so it should be.

865
01:12:02,836 --> 01:12:05,271
Maybe your English
isn't that good, either.

866
01:12:05,305 --> 01:12:08,867
Maybe that's why no one wants
to publish your books.

867
01:12:08,909 --> 01:12:10,878
So now you're a literary critic?

868
01:12:10,911 --> 01:12:12,812
That's great
coming from a waitress.

869
01:12:12,849 --> 01:12:15,578
I'm not a waitress.
I'm a dancer.

870
01:12:15,617 --> 01:12:18,017
Dancer, hell.
You'd still be begging tips...

871
01:12:18,053 --> 01:12:21,045
if I hadn't picked you up
out of that fucking restaurant.

872
01:12:28,331 --> 01:12:31,062
You little bitch!

873
01:12:36,907 --> 01:12:38,669
OK, show's over.

874
01:12:38,709 --> 01:12:40,735
You can get up now.

875
01:12:57,595 --> 01:12:59,961
Jesus, don't do this to me.

876
01:12:59,999 --> 01:13:01,125
Baby?

877
01:13:01,167 --> 01:13:02,565
Come on, say something.

878
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:03,760
Please.

879
01:13:09,209 --> 01:13:10,699
God Almighty.

880
01:13:30,532 --> 01:13:32,022
Sos médecin. Bonjour.

881
01:13:32,067 --> 01:13:35,525
Ma femme, elle est évanouie
soudainement.

882
01:13:35,571 --> 01:13:37,038
Dans quelles circonstances?

883
01:13:37,072 --> 01:13:40,439
Elle est tombée. Tombée.

884
01:13:40,476 --> 01:13:42,705
Sa tete a heurte un meuble.

885
01:13:42,744 --> 01:13:45,043
Saigne-t-elle due nez
ou des oreilles?

886
01:13:47,384 --> 01:13:49,442
Est-ce qu'elle prend
des médicaments?

887
01:13:50,221 --> 01:13:51,812
Quel age a-t-elle?

888
01:13:59,798 --> 01:14:01,594
- J'ai mal.
- Where?

889
01:14:04,536 --> 01:14:06,026
Ou tu as mal?

890
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,506
My head.

891
01:14:09,541 --> 01:14:11,406
Is it bad?

892
01:14:12,477 --> 01:14:14,503
How bad is it?

893
01:14:14,547 --> 01:14:16,309
Tiger.

894
01:14:17,984 --> 01:14:21,421
- Should I call a doctor?
- No. Just hold me.

895
01:14:27,527 --> 01:14:29,791
Baby, forgive me, please.

896
01:14:29,831 --> 01:14:32,766
I love you.

897
01:14:43,878 --> 01:14:46,642
Wow. It's great!

898
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:50,209
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm so happy.

899
01:15:07,004 --> 01:15:08,561
What a lovely evening.

900
01:15:08,605 --> 01:15:11,040
I wish it would last forever.

901
01:15:11,074 --> 01:15:13,634
Forever's a long time, baby.

902
01:15:14,944 --> 01:15:17,003
I can't think in those terms.

903
01:15:17,047 --> 01:15:18,174
I never could.

904
01:15:18,216 --> 01:15:20,183
But when something is good...

905
01:15:20,218 --> 01:15:22,687
don't you want it
to last forever?

906
01:15:22,721 --> 01:15:26,417
Sure, but good things never do.

907
01:15:26,458 --> 01:15:27,948
Not even us?

908
01:15:29,728 --> 01:15:32,356
Are we so good?

909
01:15:32,397 --> 01:15:33,625
Aren't we?

910
01:15:34,733 --> 01:15:38,500
Well, now that you
come to mention it, no.

911
01:15:38,538 --> 01:15:40,062
Not anymore.

912
01:15:43,243 --> 01:15:45,540
I...

913
01:15:45,579 --> 01:15:49,777
Come on, Mimi,
let's stop kidding ourselves.

914
01:15:49,817 --> 01:15:51,978
I don't understand.

915
01:15:52,019 --> 01:15:55,286
Look,
it was sweet while it lasted.

916
01:15:55,323 --> 01:15:59,987
Boy, it was sweet,
but it's going sour, isn't it?

917
01:16:01,597 --> 01:16:03,029
Well, isn't it?

918
01:16:04,934 --> 01:16:07,835
I'd been hoping that you'd
take the initiative...

919
01:16:07,870 --> 01:16:11,670
but, no, you seem quite happy
to let things drag on this way.

920
01:16:11,706 --> 01:16:13,072
Well, I'm not.

921
01:16:13,108 --> 01:16:15,340
I'm degrading myself
by degrading you.

922
01:16:15,378 --> 01:16:17,903
We're degrading each other,
for God's sake.

923
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:22,475
Let's not spoil
a beautiful memory.

924
01:16:22,519 --> 01:16:26,046
Let's quit while we still have
a few shreds of dignity left.

925
01:16:28,226 --> 01:16:31,592
But I love you.
All I want is you.

926
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:35,532
I want to marry you.
I want to give you babies.

927
01:16:35,567 --> 01:16:37,694
I want to give you
the rest of my life.

928
01:16:37,735 --> 01:16:40,296
I don't want the rest
of your life. I want my own.

929
01:16:40,339 --> 01:16:41,806
Can't you get it
through your head?

930
01:16:44,042 --> 01:16:46,033
What did I do wrong?

931
01:16:46,077 --> 01:16:48,069
Did I ever harm you?

932
01:16:49,915 --> 01:16:51,713
Oscar, tell me.

933
01:16:52,953 --> 01:16:56,013
Even a criminal
is told his crime.

934
01:16:56,055 --> 01:16:57,387
What did I do?

935
01:17:02,029 --> 01:17:06,241
You didn't do anything.
You exist. That's all.

936
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:20,114
I understand.

01:17:41,929 --> 01:17:43,761
most of them female.

1878
01:17:49,404 --> 01:17:50,837
Oh, shit.

1879
01:17:58,814 --> 01:18:00,008
It's me.

1880
01:18:02,884 --> 01:18:04,853
I'm here.

1881
01:18:04,887 --> 01:18:06,012
I'm scared.

1882
01:18:06,055 --> 01:18:07,181
What?

1883
01:18:07,223 --> 01:18:09,019
I can't live without you.

1884
01:18:09,058 --> 01:18:11,025
I'm afraid
you're just gonna have to.

1885
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:12,186
I won't.

1886
01:18:13,528 --> 01:18:15,996
We've been through this before,
haven't we?

1887
01:18:16,032 --> 01:18:18,660
So why don't we give it a rest?

1888
01:18:18,701 --> 01:18:22,034
Look up some friends.
Have some fun.

1889
01:18:22,072 --> 01:18:24,370
We just went over the top,
that's all.

1890
01:18:24,407 --> 01:18:25,704
In a few days...

1891
01:18:25,742 --> 01:18:29,438
you'll be grateful to me
for having made the first move.

1892
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:39,412
Was she play-acting?

1893
01:18:39,457 --> 01:18:40,754
I couldn't be sure.

1894
01:18:40,791 --> 01:18:43,124
I called her old roommate.

1895
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:45,060
No dice.

1896
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:47,359
I spent the rest of the day
wondering...

1897
01:18:47,397 --> 01:18:49,729
and half the night drinking.

1898
01:19:11,121 --> 01:19:12,783
I was waiting for you.

1899
01:19:12,824 --> 01:19:15,292
I can see that. I wonder why.

1900
01:19:15,326 --> 01:19:16,451
You know why.

1901
01:19:16,494 --> 01:19:18,655
I know I'm wrecked
and I'm gonna crash.

1902
01:19:18,697 --> 01:19:21,165
- No. Wait.
- Let go of me.

1903
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:23,464
I want to tell you something.

1904
01:19:23,502 --> 01:19:24,991
There's nothing more to be said.

1905
01:19:25,036 --> 01:19:26,129
- Please!

1906
01:19:26,171 --> 01:19:27,502
It's not going to make it
any easier on you.

1907
01:19:27,539 --> 01:19:30,508
You've got to listen to me.
Please. Please listen to me.

1908
01:19:30,541 --> 01:19:32,237
Oh, for God's sake.

1909
01:19:35,913 --> 01:19:37,404
Rita, veux-tu. Rita.

1910
01:19:40,486 --> 01:19:43,478
All right. You'd better come in.

1911
01:20:05,378 --> 01:20:06,709
Do you want one?

1912
01:20:11,451 --> 01:20:12,884
All right.

1913
01:20:14,254 --> 01:20:15,744
What's so important?

1914
01:20:15,790 --> 01:20:17,757
It's true what I said.

1915
01:20:17,791 --> 01:20:19,919
I can't live without you.

1916
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:21,894
If that's all you came
to tell me-

1917
01:20:21,928 --> 01:20:23,863
Please, don't throw me out.

1918
01:20:23,898 --> 01:20:26,059
Give me one last chance.

1919
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:29,934
I'm ready to live with you
on any terms, any at all.

1920
01:20:29,970 --> 01:20:33,633
I can bear anything as long
as I'm with you sometimes.

1921
01:20:36,143 --> 01:20:37,770
You can shout at me.

1922
01:20:37,812 --> 01:20:39,279
You can hit me.

1923
01:20:39,312 --> 01:20:41,282
You can have other women.

1924
01:20:41,316 --> 01:20:44,716
I don't care what you do,
but, please...

1925
01:20:45,986 --> 01:20:47,477
don't send me away.

1926
01:20:48,990 --> 01:20:52,152
Even if you don't
love me anymore...

1927
01:20:52,194 --> 01:20:54,662
keep me with you out of pity.

1928
01:20:55,931 --> 01:20:58,899
There's nothing I wouldn't do
to stay with you.

1929
01:20:58,934 --> 01:21:01,165
Please. Please.

1930
01:21:02,270 --> 01:21:03,898
Please.

1931
01:21:03,939 --> 01:21:05,840
I beg you.

1932
01:21:06,942 --> 01:21:09,809
Please! Please!

1933
01:21:10,979 --> 01:21:12,140
I beg you.

1934
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:14,910
Everyone has a sadistic streak.

1935
01:21:14,950 --> 01:21:16,577
Nothing brings it out better...

1936
01:21:16,619 --> 01:21:20,145
than the knowledge you've got
someone at your mercy.

1937
01:21:20,189 --> 01:21:24,320
If she really fancied
living in a living hell...

1938
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:28,091
I'd make it so hot,
even she would want out.

1939
01:21:32,201 --> 01:21:33,896
Yeah, it feels so good.

1940
01:21:35,472 --> 01:21:37,302
Yeah, it does, Cindy.

1941
01:21:38,641 --> 01:21:40,803
Cindy?

1942
01:21:40,843 --> 01:21:43,836
I mean Minnie, uh, Mimi.

1943
01:22:27,159 --> 01:22:29,092
Sure, I'm on.

1944
01:22:29,127 --> 01:22:30,356
Yeah, why not?

1945
01:22:31,596 --> 01:22:35,397
Round up a couple of chicks.
We'll make a night of it.

1946
01:22:35,433 --> 01:22:37,299
Who?

1947
01:22:37,335 --> 01:22:38,563
Oh, you bet.

1948
01:22:38,603 --> 01:22:41,401
She's the best piece of ass
this side of the river.

1949
01:22:44,577 --> 01:22:46,772
All right.

1950
01:22:46,813 --> 01:22:48,507
Yeah, I'll see you there.

1951
01:22:51,117 --> 01:22:52,414
Dinner's ready.

1952
01:22:52,451 --> 01:22:54,385
I'm eating out.

1953
01:22:54,421 --> 01:22:55,580
Tonight?

1954
01:22:55,621 --> 01:22:57,418
What's so special about tonight?

1955
01:22:57,456 --> 01:22:58,787
It's your holiday.

1956
01:22:58,824 --> 01:23:00,314
What holiday?

1957
01:23:00,359 --> 01:23:02,054
Thanksgiving.

1958
01:23:02,094 --> 01:23:04,893
I wanted to surprise you.

1959
01:23:04,931 --> 01:23:07,263
All right.
Let's see what you got.

1960
01:23:17,811 --> 01:23:19,870
Christ, what is that?

1961
01:23:19,913 --> 01:23:21,813
Turkey.

1962
01:23:21,848 --> 01:23:23,783
I cooked it for you special.

1963
01:23:26,220 --> 01:23:27,915
Cremated it, you mean.

1964
01:23:30,525 --> 01:23:33,322
That's it. I'm off.

1965
01:23:33,361 --> 01:23:35,727
Won't you even try a little?

1966
01:23:35,763 --> 01:23:36,889
You're joking.

1967
01:23:36,931 --> 01:23:39,922
I have too much respect
for my dentist.

1968
01:23:39,967 --> 01:23:42,333
Listen, in the future,
forget about cooking.

1969
01:23:42,369 --> 01:23:44,235
Stick to what you can do.

1970
01:23:44,273 --> 01:23:46,900
Which reminds me, what happened
to your dance classes?

1971
01:23:46,941 --> 01:23:49,933
Dancing has to come
from the heart.

1972
01:23:49,977 --> 01:23:50,603
So?

1973
01:23:52,327 --> 01:23:54,193
My heart is broken.

1974
01:24:01,002 --> 01:24:03,129
I was getting to her at last.

1975
01:24:03,172 --> 01:24:05,664
I'd achieved the impossible.

1976
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:08,176
She was losing her looks
and her figure...

1977
01:24:08,211 --> 01:24:09,734
wasting away...

1978
01:24:09,779 --> 01:24:11,474
breaking out
in nervous rashes...

1979
01:24:11,514 --> 01:24:13,209
developing spots.

1980
01:24:20,089 --> 01:24:23,422
We were just admiring
your new hairstyle.

1981
01:24:23,459 --> 01:24:24,722
Really?

1982
01:24:24,761 --> 01:24:28,094
Susan here thinks it suits you.
I do, too.

1983
01:24:28,131 --> 01:24:32,158
I can't put my finger on it,
but it reminds me of something.

1984
01:24:32,202 --> 01:24:33,760
I know! Rita!

1985
01:24:35,038 --> 01:24:36,403
Rita?

1986
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:38,032
You know Rita.

1987
01:24:38,074 --> 01:24:40,166
Rita. The neighbor's dog.

1988
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:45,344
Just a minute. Wait.

1989
01:24:45,383 --> 01:24:47,783
What's that?
Looks like a zit.

1990
01:24:47,819 --> 01:24:49,410
It is.

1991
01:24:49,454 --> 01:24:51,388
And your nose is shiny, too.

1992
01:24:51,422 --> 01:24:55,915
I'm not a makeup artist,
but I could do better than that.

1993
01:25:24,889 --> 01:25:29,122
Hey! I didn't know we were
having a Halloween party.

1994
01:25:33,932 --> 01:25:36,662
She was so easy to hurt...

1995
01:25:36,702 --> 01:25:39,830
it was getting to be
like shooting fish in a barrel.

1996
01:25:50,049 --> 01:25:53,212
Not now, for Christ's sake!

1997
01:25:53,253 --> 01:25:55,744
Can't you see that
I'm trying to work?

1998
01:25:58,091 --> 01:26:02,027
Anyway, have I ever asked you
to clean the house for me?

1999
01:26:02,061 --> 01:26:04,996
No. So stop playing the martyr.

2000
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:07,000
Take that thing off your head.

2001
01:26:07,034 --> 01:26:10,560
It makes you look
even uglier than usual.

2002
01:26:10,604 --> 01:26:11,935
You're really
letting yourself go.

2003
01:26:11,972 --> 01:26:15,134
I'm ashamed to be seen going
around with you these days.

2004
01:26:23,117 --> 01:26:24,846
What is it now?

2005
01:26:28,556 --> 01:26:30,889
I expect...

2006
01:26:38,899 --> 01:26:40,891
What do you expect?

2007
01:26:40,935 --> 01:26:42,096
A baby.

2008
01:26:51,513 --> 01:26:53,447
What did you say?

2009
01:26:53,481 --> 01:26:55,472
I'm going to have a baby.

2010
01:26:57,153 --> 01:26:59,177
Oh, my God.

2011
01:27:04,326 --> 01:27:05,850
How long have you known?

2012
01:27:05,894 --> 01:27:08,090
Only since yesterday.

2013
01:27:08,130 --> 01:27:09,961
Two months, the doctor says.

2014
01:27:18,741 --> 01:27:20,971
What are you going
to do about it?

2015
01:27:24,580 --> 01:27:26,070
Do about it?

2016
01:27:28,518 --> 01:27:29,883
Look at me.

2017
01:27:31,188 --> 01:27:33,179
Do I look like a daddy?

2018
01:27:34,625 --> 01:27:37,890
Can you see us bringing up
a child in this place?

2019
01:27:39,796 --> 01:27:40,922
I'm pushing forty.

2020
01:27:40,964 --> 01:27:44,421
I haven't even sold
a single book yet.

2021
01:27:44,468 --> 01:27:46,493
The world doesn't know I exist.

2022
01:27:49,674 --> 01:27:51,801
Not a day goes by that I don't
think it might be better...

2023
01:27:51,843 --> 01:27:54,141
just to kill myself
and be done with it.

2024
01:28:09,827 --> 01:28:13,285
Would it be fair to saddle
a child with a father like this?

2025
01:28:14,599 --> 01:28:16,191
Be honest.

2026
01:28:45,597 --> 01:28:47,724
They'd told me
there were complications...

2027
01:28:47,766 --> 01:28:49,064
but I wasn't prepared...

2028
01:28:49,102 --> 01:28:53,368
to see her looking
like a marble figure on a tomb.

2029
01:28:53,406 --> 01:28:57,740
For a moment, I almost weakened.

2030
01:28:59,379 --> 01:29:01,006
You came.

2031
01:29:01,046 --> 01:29:02,480
Why wouldn't I?

2032
01:29:04,717 --> 01:29:06,709
I brought you flowers.

2033
01:29:15,763 --> 01:29:16,957
You're here.

2034
01:29:16,996 --> 01:29:18,486
Nothing else matters.

2035
01:29:26,606 --> 01:29:30,703
I've been thinking,
that when you're on your feet...

2036
01:29:30,746 --> 01:29:34,272
we'll go away together,
just the two of us.

2037
01:29:34,316 --> 01:29:35,509
Go away?

2038
01:29:35,549 --> 01:29:39,485

the same to her.

2064
01:32:12,412 --> 01:32:16,314
Depends on your state of mind,
the way things grab you.

2065
01:32:16,350 --> 01:32:20,115
To her,
it must have been poison.

To me, sweet as a peach.

2067
01:32:25,126 --> 01:32:27,389
I don't know about you.

2068
01:32:27,427 --> 01:32:29,623
Sometimes I think you make
things up as you go along.

I wish you were right.

I might have made it
into print after all.

2072
01:32:37,338 --> 01:32:40,796
I mean, if even half
that story were true...

2073
01:32:40,841 --> 01:32:43,571
you'd be too bloody ashamed
to tell it.

Are you still angry with me?

2077
01:33:13,341 --> 01:33:15,311
I don't know. I'm confused.

2078
01:33:18,915 --> 01:33:20,905
I wanted you to hear it.

2079

I'd sooner have heard it
from you.

2080
01:33:28,190 --> 01:33:31,718
I leave the words to him.
They're all he has left.

2081
01:34:01,826 --> 01:34:06,319
When can we be alone together?

2082
01:34:06,363 --> 01:34:09,298
I mean, you know, really alone.

2083

Then we'll see.

Here you are.
I wondered where you were.

2086

You missed dinner.

2087
01:35:10,430 --> 01:35:13,398
I completely lost track of time.
I'm really sorry.

2088

Never mind.
Dado's been keeping me company.

Good. How did the bridge go?

2090

2091
01:35:20,373 --> 01:35:23,241
We had very, very bad luck.

2092

Never had such terrible hands
in my entire life.

Never mind, Dado.
Unlucky at cards, lucky in love.
