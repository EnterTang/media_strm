1
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,996
We've been living peacefully
outside the border

2
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,432
Why must we come back here?

3
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:52,164
It's been 10 years.
Have you come back for her?!

4
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:58,210
No. The reason for my return is that,
I hear...

5
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,541
the Plum Blossom Bandit has reappeared

6
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:03,548
Yes, what's that got to do with us?

7
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,208
Twenty years ago, the Plum Blossom Bandit

8
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,752
was a well known master
in the martial world

9
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:11,290
He has harmed a lot of people

10
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,219
I wanted to look for him 10 years ago

11
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,192
He just vanished suddenly

12
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:19,754
I think he might want to look me up now

13
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,595
Inspite of knowing all this...

14
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,225
then what are you doing back?

15
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:28,529
He must have gone to look for me
at my old house

16
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,171
Are you worried that
he might hurt your cousin?

17
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,812
If you love her so much...

18
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:36,745
Why did you let her marry Long Xiaoyun?

19
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,110
I know that he once saved your life

20
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,882
But I've never heard of anyone
who would...

21
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,980
give up his fiancee and property
for gratitude

22
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,451
That happened ten years ago

23
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:53,258
There's no need to bring it up

24
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,574
Aren't you cold? You want a sip of wine?

25
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,715
Are you deaf?

26
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:54,617
So you're not deaf. Have a sip

27
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:55,694
I can't afford it

28
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,623
Don't worry, it's my treat

29
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,832
I don't want to take things from others

30
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:04,994
I don't want to drink wine
which I didn't buy

31
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,306
Have I made myself clear?

32
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:10,633
Yes, quite

33
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:11,641
Then please leave

34
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,871
I will

35
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,006
Say, when you can afford it...

36
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:18,242
will you treat me to a drink?

37
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,615
Certainly

38
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,473
Sit down please

39
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,748
Over there

40
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:58,583
Your wine, young master

41
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,059
There're a few
from the Golden Lion Escort Agency

42
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,761
They're escorting something
from out of town

43
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:14,671
Number two

44
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,401
Do you remember that time we came across

45
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,101
...the Four Tigers of Tai Xing?

46
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,145
How can I forget? That day they tried

47
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:22,476
...to steal from you

48
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,948
But they are no match for you

49
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:42,832
So you're 'Sudden Wind Sword' Zhuge Lei?

50
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:45,199
May I ask your names?
Sorry I didn't recognize

51
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:49,404
You aren't worthy of knowing our names

52
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:52,000
Just leave what you are escorting

53
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:53,703
...and we'll spare your life

54
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,303
Put down your swords

55
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,882
And we'll let you live

56
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:32,848
Are you 'The Black and White Snake?"

57
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:36,744
Well, at least you've heard of us!

58
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,520
Since the two want this package

59
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,020
Go on, take it

60
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,500
Looks like there's
another grand master here

61
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,001
We've almost missed you

62
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,366
If you're interested in this package

63
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,673
And if you can defeat us;

64
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,644
Not only we'll give this to you

65
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,271
We're willing to give you our heads

66
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,549
Your heads are worth nothing

67
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,453
Did you say that?

68
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,584
Yes

69
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:20,227
It's a pity mine is worthless

70
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:24,429
It's too much, I just want 50 taels

71
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:27,097
Fine, if you can kill me...

72
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,332
I'll give you 50 taels

73
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:47,619
My money!

74
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,927
Take it, take all of it

75
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,288
So, it's you!

76
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:36,067
I can afford to buy you a drink now

77
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:38,737
With pleasure

78
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,020
I look for good drinking company

79
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,284
...and a good place

80
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:55,587
I hate crowds

81
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:56,923
Please

82
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:04,064
Judging from the awe
they had in their eyes...

83
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,434
you seem like someone well known

84
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:13,241
It's not a good thing to be famous

85
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,045
My name is Li Xunhuan, and yourself?

86
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:16,910
Ah Fei

87
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:17,710
Ah Fei?

88
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:18,875
Right

89
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:22,318
I'm an orphan who grew up
in the wilderness

90
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,584
I envy the birds flying in the sky

91
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,056
Hence my name!

92
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,284
Strange name indeed. Cheers

93
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:39,165
You shouldn't be drinking while coughing

94
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,408
Yes, I shouldn't touch any alcohol

95
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:44,942
Then why do you drink?

96
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,046
Do you have a sad past?

97
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,173
Have I asked anything
you don't want to answer?

98
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,409
No

99
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,084
Then why did you ask?

100
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:57,781
Okay, I won't

101
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,888
Even if you want to ask,
it'll have to wait

102
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,052
We've got company

103
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:07,622
Yes, one on the tree on the left

104
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,563
Four at the temple ruins

105
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,500
One behind the tree

106
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:51,736
Li's Legendary Dagger,
Never a miss! So overrated

107
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:06,952
Give up the package

108
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,651
And we'll leave you alone

109
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,623
I've got the package

110
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,066
Let's have another drink
before I head off

111
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,840
Go! Chase...

112
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,344
Wait for me here

113
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,901
Who are you?

114
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,332
Li Xunhuan

115
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:30,874
Finally you are here

116
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,034
You've been waiting for me?

117
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,237
A hero called Ah fey has killed many

118
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:35,608
except one;
he told me to keep an eye on him

119
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:36,874
And wait for you

120
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:37,471
Where's the person?

121
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,550
Here

122
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:47,320
What are you doing here?

123
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:50,623
This is the only house around

124
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,425
After I've got the package

125
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:55,500
...I wanted to rest here for a night

126
00:13:55,601 --> 00:14:00,095
Who'd have known that
your young friend's here!

127
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,364
Have some tea

128
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:07,609
Thanks

129
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,788
Are you alright, sir?

130
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,218
I'm not used to drinking tea

131
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,758
Then have some wine

132
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,554
- Do you have any?
- Yes

133
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,024
Great

134
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:23,116
Just a minute

135
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:26,159
I'll give you the package

136
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,630
Please let me go

137
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,796
What's inside the package?

138
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:33,064
Why are so many after it?

139
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:34,937
You honestly don't know?

140
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,734
Now that the Plum Flower Bandit
reappeared

141
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:39,333
Inside the package

142
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,912
is the unique

143
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,140
Gold Threaded Vest. It's like an armour

144
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:46,681
No wonder!

145
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,377
Wine, sir

146
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,453
Thanks

147
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:53,053
Please let me go

148
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,989
I'll give you everything

149
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,391
I've an old grandmother

150
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,554
Three children

151
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,902
A lot of people are after this package

152
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,751
So are you

153
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:27,622
I kept my mouth shut
before you had your tea

154
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:30,695
Now that you've had a sip of poison tea

155
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:33,230
...at the most I can wait here
one more hour

156
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,300
You'll die of poisoning

157
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,169
I wasn't a part of it

158
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:40,935
Who are you?

159
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:43,541
Maybe you should know...

160
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,507
who killed you!

161
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,674
What a pretty girl

162
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,582
I'd watch out should I see you again

163
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,379
Do you think you'll see me again?

164
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:59,616
Of course, you know the tea is poisoned

165
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,125
But you didn't know that
when I was coughing

166
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,354
...I spit out the tea

167
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,163
Come on

168
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,832
lmpressive!

169
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,315
Don't fight them. If you use your energy

170
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:01,375
...the poison inside you
will circulate faster

171
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,857
The girl forced me into poisoning the tea

172
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:13,827
But I was responsible for
poisoning the wine

173
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,628
The wine too?

174
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,463
Couldn't you taste it?

175
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:19,836
You are...

176
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,102
One of the Seven Incredible Men

177
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:28,339
The mean and shameless one... Hua Feng

178
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,179
I see

179
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,341
Not anymore

180
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:36,444
Now I'm the richest man
in the martial arts world

181
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,683
For I own the Gold Threaded Vest

182
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,218
You... you...

183
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:45,486
It's called, Fisherman gains
when snipe & clam fight

184
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:46,962
You... you...

185
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,172
Master

186
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:04,614
Chuanjia

187
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,573
Master

188
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:07,208
Chuanjia

189
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,251
Master

190
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:09,217
Hurry, go after him

191
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,219
Sure

192
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:20,720
He is over there

193
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:30,533
Dead!

194
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:32,438
Maybe he's got the antidote

195
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,569
Be careful

196
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,580
He could have other poisonous weapons

197
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,610
Don't scratch yourself

198
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:39,513
I know

199
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:46,388
Nothing at all

200
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:48,993
I knew it

201
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,654
I'm never that lucky

202
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:57,661
Excellent wine

203
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,644
Where do you think you're going?

204
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:09,278
Despite charging us,
you didn't treat the patient

205
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:12,248
What'd you mean by coming here
and drinking wine?

206
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,318
Haven't you heard

207
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:20,824
...that I've a habit?

208
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,120
What habit?

209
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:26,391
I don't treat patients when I drink

210
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,696
Damn it, I'll kill you

211
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:35,067
I wouldn't treat the patient,
if you want to kill me

212
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,003
Let's talk this over

213
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,373
No one needs to get hurt

214
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,310
Mind your own business

215
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,520
Don't run

216
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:53,022
Don't run

217
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,456
Don't run

218
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,895
Odd indeed that the one
who is telling us not to run

219
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:03,991
...is instead running away himself!

220
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:11,565
Do you now know who I am?

221
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:14,611
Sorry, may I know your name?

222
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:16,472
In that case...

223
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,710
You save me not because
you wanted my cure

224
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,246
Why do we need your help to cure us?

225
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,987
Your master's poisoned by
my Cold Chicken powder

226
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,560
I'm the only one who can cure him

227
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,595
No one else can

228
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:38,465
Someone stole the powder from me
a year ago

229
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,164
And now you've been poisoned

230
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:42,297
Come on,

231
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:46,537
Nothing is better than drinking to death

232
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:49,712
Let's have a drink first

233
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:52,045
Mr. Mei, you said you'll cure my master

234
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,708
Why are you drinking?

235
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:59,748
Why should trivial matters
such as life and death

236
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:01,485
...get in the way of drinking?

237
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:06,587
If you don't give me some wine,
I won't help

238
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:15,128
Master

239
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,167
Come on

240
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,439
You know that our master...

241
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:25,038
can only live for two more hours?

242
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,516
Why aren't you doing anything?

243
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,753
I wouldn't be Mei Er...

244
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,885
if you know when I've cured you

245
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,862
I've already cured him

246
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:52,409
The wine is the antidote

247
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:55,737
Thank you, doctor

248
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,674
What are you doing?

249
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:00,416
What are you doing here?

250
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:03,745
I'm Tian Qi

251
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:06,790
Please excuse my two friends

252
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,723
I'm here to apologize for them

253
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,259
Sounds good

254
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:15,731
Someone's hurt by the Plum Blossom Bandit

255
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,632
Could you treat him first?

256
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:22,202
Is he badly injured?

257
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:25,174
A minor wound on his shoulders

258
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:28,542
Is that it?
Then I don't have to go personally

259
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:31,411
Just take the medicine. Where is he?

260
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,710
Xingyun Manor

261
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:33,774
Who's the injured person?

262
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:35,785
Master Long Xiaoyun

263
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:51,862
Xunhuan

264
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,665
Yes, it's me

265
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:57,972
You're really here

266
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:02,672
I brought some medicine
from Mei Er for you

267
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,215
Plum Blossom Bandit has resurfaced!

268
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:11,255
Right, he's now in Baoding City

269
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:13,415
He has injured many

270
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,049
Where did it all take place?

271
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,622
My back garden. The Plum...

272
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,196
Blossom Forest in front of
Cold Fragrance Chamber

273
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,828
Why there?

274
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:27,134
Because Lin Xianer lives there

275
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,831
Who's Lin Xianer?

276
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:34,208
The number one beauty
of martial arts world

277
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,280
Do you have any idea...

278
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:39,782
how many have fallen
head over heels for her?

279
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,951
What's her connection to you,
Brother Long?

280
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,116
Why's she living
in the Cold Fragrance Chamber?

281
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,691
Let me fill you in the details

282
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:53,060
I heard that Miss Lin's father...

283
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:55,690
was killed by the Plum Blossom Bandit

284
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:59,259
She has announced that...

285
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,362
she'll marry whoever kills
the Plum Blossom Bandit

286
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,441
...regardless of age, status and wealth

287
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:04,907
She'll marry that person

288
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:08,107
She's going to meet with
a group of heroes

289
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,737
...here today

290
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,975
Hence she has been putting up
at the chamber

291
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:16,313
Master Long

292
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:18,389
Master Gongsun and many heroes

293
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,718
...have arrived

294
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:24,260
If it weren't for Lin Xianer's beauty...

295
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:26,523
I doubt so many important guests
will show up

296
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,189
Even if it were a great feast

297
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,735
Clean up the guest rooms
in the East Chamber

298
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:32,667
Yes

299
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:37,635
You must be tired after yourjourney

300
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:39,676
Take a rest in the guest room

301
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:42,770
Then I'll introduce you to everyone

302
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:52,448
It's time of the red plum season

303
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,655
Wonder how plum blossoms are like
at the pavilion!

304
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:42,797
Fallen plums like the snow...

305
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:47,277
It's been 10 years.
Wonder how the plum blossoms are

306
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,387
You're back

307
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,126
10 years. You're still drinking
as you were

308
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:17,700
Ten years seems like a long time,
but it passed by

309
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:22,438
If I don't drink,
life seems like such a burden!

310
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:30,086
Who told you to do so?

311
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:32,517
Myself

312
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:35,121
Why?

313
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:40,031
Because I owe my life to someone

314
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,723
To be benevolent to your savior
you feigned idiocy

315
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:49,034
You got drunk all the time,
frequented the brothels

316
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:54,201
Yes, I was hoping you'd give up on me

317
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:55,745
...and marry Long Xiaoyun

318
00:26:56,247 --> 00:27:00,240
Do you think I'd be happy?

319
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:06,214
After you've left

320
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:08,918
I found out the truth

321
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:13,095
I wanted to kill myself

322
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:16,659
And then I thought...

323
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:18,292
I'd better stay alive

324
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:25,169
Because there's a chance
we'll see each other again

325
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:30,907
Too bad, things have changed now

326
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:41,589
The past is in the past

327
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:54,804
Lady Lin

328
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:04,874
Where's Master Li?

329
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,649
He's right here

330
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:14,521
Master Li, all the guests have arrived

331
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:17,220
Master Long invites you
to Cold Fragrance Chamber

332
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:18,786
Please

333
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:23,094
Let me introduce you

334
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,396
My sworn brother Li Xunhuan

335
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:26,902
Li Ning of Wudang Clan

336
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:27,596
Pleased to meet you

337
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,730
Golden Fist Deng Lie

338
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,431
Delighted

339
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,473
Wang Chen, Golden Palms of Hua Shan

340
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:31,064
Pleased to meet you

341
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:32,905
Master Tian Qi, the Iron Sword

342
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:34,205
Delighted

343
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:37,577
This is the renowned Master Gongsun

344
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:39,377
Pleased to meet you

345
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:44,115
Master Li was a legendary character
ten years ago

346
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:47,555
I'm glad to finally meet you

347
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,149
Same here

348
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,566
He's Longsheng,
young master of Hidden Sword Manor

349
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:04,565
He's proud and aloof,
with incredible swordplay

350
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:08,635
Nonetheless he is infatuated with
Lin Xianer

351
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:12,274
He's most eager to have
Plum Blossom Bandit dead

352
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:14,084
Master Zhao is here

353
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,515
Master Zhao

354
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:22,718
Sorry I am late

355
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:25,387
No problem

356
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:28,591
Master Zhao, why are you here
with so much gold?

357
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,962
There is a saying:

358
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:32,798
It's everyone's duty
to rid the society of evils

359
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:37,431
I hate the pests of the society

360
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,976
That's why I'm here today

361
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:42,137
I hope to eliminate a public enemy

362
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,044
And I brought along
10,000 taels of gold as...

363
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,310
a reward for the one
who kills Plum Blossom Bandit

364
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:51,989
Where's Miss Lin?

365
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:17,741
Miss Lin...

366
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,179
Please sit down

367
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:30,753
My father was murdered,
I can't wait to get my revenge

368
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:32,887
That's why I take this opportunity here

369
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,625
...to say this in person

370
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:38,392
Whoever kills the Plum Blossom Bandit

371
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,767
regardless of age, status and wealth

372
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:43,670
I, Lin Xianer,
will keep my promise to marry him

373
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:49,538
What Miss Lin is about to do...

374
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,342
has set a good example forjustice

375
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:54,111
I admire your courage

376
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:55,516
I don't deserve such praise
from Master Zhao

377
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,960
This is...

378
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:07,463
My sworn brother Li Xunhuan

379
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:12,029
No wonder he's so good with the daggers

380
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:13,895
Have you two met?

381
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:16,997
Yes, and I've offended him

382
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:19,702
Can I have a word with Master Li alone?

383
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:20,937
Certainly

384
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:30,347
You should know why I'm here

385
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,355
You need that Gold Threaded Vest

386
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,123
because you'll go up against
the Plum Blossom Bandit

387
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,055
That's right

388
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:36,687
Is that it?

389
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,330
If you want to find out more...

390
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:43,025
Meet me here at midnight

391
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:44,533
And I'll let you know the details

392
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:34,948
There have been two deaths here

393
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:37,817
One is the younger brother
of the Master Iron Flute

394
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:40,720
The other is the only son
of Master Zhao Zhengyi

395
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:43,851
They died at midnight

396
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,827
Why at midnight?

397
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,490
Because people say
the Plum Blossom Bandit

398
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,692
always shows up around midnight

399
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:55,563
The Plum Blossom Bandit?

400
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:17,092
Longsheng... young master
of Hidden Sword Mansion

401
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:18,423
That's me

402
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:43,011
Why do you want to kill me?

403
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,816
Someone wants me to kill you

404
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:35,404
Hurry... inside

405
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:36,939
Look

406
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:42,336
Master You?

407
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:43,345
Someone over there

408
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:49,581
What's going on?

409
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:50,881
Who told you to come here?

410
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:51,613
Miss Lin Xianer

411
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:53,053
Bullshit

412
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:55,682
Miss Lin Xianer has left in the evening

413
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:57,522
I saw her off personally

414
00:34:58,229 --> 00:34:59,491
That can't be,

415
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,963
I was just talking to her earlier

416
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:04,159
If she hasn't told me to meet her here

417
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,462
...what would I be doing here?

418
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,730
To kill

419
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:07,968
To kill?

420
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:09,096
That's right

421
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:18,381
At midnight the Plum Blossom Bandit
will show up

422
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:19,575
A concerned person

423
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,544
At midnight,

424
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:24,280
you killed Master You

425
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:25,116
Get him

426
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:36,598
You've got it all wrong

427
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,225
We all were set up in a trap

428
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:40,600
Let's sit down and talk this over

429
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:41,672
We're not interested

430
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:47,301
Looks like all of you...

431
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:50,175
are hell bent to kill me now

432
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:53,541
Don't come any closer

433
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:57,654
That was a warning,

434
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:01,054
next time it's gonna be for real

435
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,856
Zhao Zhengyi, you said earlier that

436
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:10,729
you want to get rid of
the pests in society?

437
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,094
Why don't you do something!

438
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:20,167
Right, are you waiting for
Master Tian Qi?

439
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:22,644
Or Master Gongsun?

440
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:24,278
Xunhuan, Xunhuan

441
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:29,783
That's so strange, you all wanted me dead

442
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:31,479
Why don't you do something?

443
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:33,454
I think you've got it wrong

444
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:34,820
My sworn brother won't be
the Plum Blossom Bandit

445
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:36,223
Xunhuan, please hold your temper

446
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:37,794
Brother Long

447
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:42,728
Master Zhao, we must kill him today

448
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,091
What are you doing?

449
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,367
Stop it, everyone

450
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,972
Let him go first

451
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:51,564
No matter what crime he has done

452
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,405
...I'll take full responsibility

453
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:54,975
We just can't let
the Plum Blossom Bandit walk away

454
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:56,603
That's right

455
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:00,373
Xunhuan, why don't you tell them...

456
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:01,610
that you're no Plum Blossom Bandit?

457
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,521
It took them a while to catch a suspect

458
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:07,318
I don't want to ruin their excitement

459
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:14,486
Chuanjia

460
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:22,097
Let's go, young master

461
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:23,867
Chuanjia

462
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:25,242
Xunhuan

463
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:29,138
Do you remember the day we first met?

464
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,441
The Justice Eight accused you for

465
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,641
...killing their head Meng Tianjie

466
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,583
I told you to leave
just like you're doing now

467
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:37,153
You remember what you said then?

468
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,449
I said I didn't kill anyone

469
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:40,387
I won't leave...

470
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:41,480
before this matter is cleared up

471
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:44,127
Then why are you telling me to leave now?

472
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:48,197
I think you won't believe
I'm the Plum Blossom Bandit!

473
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,098
But before they get to
the bottom of all this...

474
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:52,533
they shouldn't hurt you now

475
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:55,663
There's no need for
further investigation. We're right

476
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,671
He is the Plum Blossom Bandit

477
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:57,763
Shut up

478
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:00,705
Ah Fei

479
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:09,276
Who are you? What do you want?

480
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:12,078
Who are you? What do you want?

481
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,182
I want to teach you a lesson

482
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:25,861
My friend

483
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:34,376
Very impressive, at such a young age

484
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:37,470
I'm Zhao Zhengyi, the impartial person

485
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:39,708
And your name is?

486
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,842
I want to be your friend

487
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,885
I don't have a name,

488
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,785
and I don't want you as my friend

489
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:52,493
Your package

490
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:55,054
So you killed Hua Feng

491
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,999
That's right, he was carrying the package

492
00:38:58,102 --> 00:38:59,933
I knew he couldn't be a good person

493
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:02,801
I went back to look for you,
but you weren't there

494
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:04,932
Then I found out you're here

495
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,202
What's going on?

496
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:10,876
They said I'm the Plum Blossom Bandit

497
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:12,514
Bullshit

498
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:14,077
Come on, let's go for a drink

499
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,083
Wait

500
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,811
It's just the Plum Blossom Bandit
we're after

501
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:21,915
You shouldn't get involved

502
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,653
Who said he's the Plum Blossom Bandit?

503
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:25,922
I said so

504
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:38,805
Shiyin

505
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:39,773
What's going on?

506
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,071
I have no idea

507
00:39:57,995 --> 00:40:01,658
Tell the others that
you're the Plum Blossom Bandit

508
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:02,696
Are you crazy?

509
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,859
How would I be the Plum Blossom Bandit?

510
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,608
I'll ask you one more time

511
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:15,201
This is your last chance. Are you?

512
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:20,715
Yes, I'm the Plum Blossom Bandit

513
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,953
You heard him, everyone

514
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:28,024
If his word is to be trusted...

515
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,683
He is the Plum Blossom Bandit

516
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:33,229
Young man, that's not fair

517
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,992
I mean this is
how the martial world functions

518
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,295
The one with
the quickest sword is the boss

519
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:54,681
So?

520
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,943
Anyone else?

521
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:03,217
Let's go

522
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:04,089
Wait

523
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:07,995
How do you know I'm not that Bandit?

524
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:11,895
I grew up in the wilderness,
like an animal

525
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:14,971
I've an instinct
to distinguish good and evil

526
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:16,772
If I leave now...

527
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:17,932
They will be more certain that

528
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:20,203
...I'm the suspect

529
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,637
Xunhuan is right

530
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:24,907
He can leave when we're sure of the facts

531
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:27,612
Right

532
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:29,913
Fine, I'll be in the deserted temple
in the outskirts

533
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:30,987
Come look for me should you need me

534
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:31,713
Great

535
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:33,590
Young brother

536
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:38,924
I don't need the Gold Threaded Vest,
you take this

537
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:48,394
I got it, bye

538
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:16,628
So you're here for the package

539
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,103
The Plum Blossom Bandit?

540
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:30,941
You got hit with my Plum Blossom Nails

541
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,276
You shouldn't be able to move

542
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:47,988
Li Xunhuan was right

543
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:50,498
He knew someone
would come after this vest

544
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:51,465
Before I left

545
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:54,129
He told me to wear it

546
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,320
Very impressive

547
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,034
What are you doing here?

548
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:36,305
Here's your belongings. Leave now

549
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:37,903
Why must I leave?

550
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:41,576
Can't you tell
they're doing this on purpose?

551
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,312
I've suspected it,

552
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:47,947
since the first day
I came back to the country,

553
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:50,458
there's a trap waiting for me

554
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:54,223
The Gold Threaded Vest, Lin Xianer

555
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:56,458
and now they call me
the Plum Blossom Bandit

556
00:43:57,568 --> 00:43:59,229
Who is trying to hurt me?

557
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:01,236
Since you know that
someone's trying to hurt you

558
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:03,203
You should better leave soon

559
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:06,475
Have you seen the spider webs?

560
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:08,305
Yes

561
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:13,346
We're like the spiders

562
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:17,914
We all want to make our own web

563
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:21,486
Then we can live in it forever

564
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:27,859
For everything that we've done

565
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:33,528
For money, love, friendship,
for ourselves

566
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:37,570
We've made our own web to tie us up

567
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:41,343
Then we're trapped in it

568
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:44,039
No matter what we do, we can't get out

569
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:48,648
Some people call this fate

570
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:54,116
Why are you back, cousin?

571
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:56,557
Destiny!

572
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,628
Xunhuan...

573
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:02,221
Shiyin, what are you doing here?

574
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:05,526
She's here to see me

575
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:09,705
Although I released your vital points
the other day

576
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:11,672
But I worried for your health

577
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:13,367
Here's some herbal tea for you

578
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:14,444
Thanks, Brother Long

579
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,743
Xiaoyun,

580
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:18,838
you know that
he's not the Plum Blossom Bandit

581
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:21,076
Why don't you help him clear all this up?

582
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:22,117
Don't worry,

583
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,653
we'll soon know the truth

584
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:25,619
They've already sent someone...

585
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,918
to inform Master Xinmei of Shaolin Temple

586
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:29,356
They'll send a representative here soon

587
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:32,393
The Shaolin Temple is famous forjustice

588
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:33,861
They won't wrongly accuse people

589
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:36,225
Master, master

590
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:37,998
What is it?

591
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:39,694
Master Zhao said it's urgent

592
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:41,031
He's waiting for you in the hall

593
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:47,038
Folks, what's going on?

594
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:49,470
We've just received news

595
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,515
Master Xinmei will arrive soon

596
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:54,911
That's great

597
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:57,187
The bad news is...

598
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:59,380
Mr. Iron Flute is also on the road

599
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:01,822
He's famous for retaliation

600
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,449
If he launches a fight,

601
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,461
We're no match for him

602
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:08,554
If he gets here
earlier than Master Xinmei

603
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:09,893
...and kills Li Xunhuan

604
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,332
Then what can we tell the Shaolin Temple?

605
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:18,271
Li Xunhuan's friend is a problem too

606
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:19,740
We must watch out for him

607
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:23,870
Don't worry, I've an idea

608
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:26,975
What? Your master is in danger

609
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:29,109
I heard that
someone will kill my master tonight

610
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:30,846
He's a martial arts expert

611
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:31,579
Where is your master now?

612
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:32,882
Locked in the stock room

613
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,638
Li Xunhuan

614
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,282
So this is a trap!

615
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:07,823
I presumed you to be just

616
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:12,591
I told you to mind your own business

617
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:13,355
Get him

618
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:42,087
Don't worry, he won't run far

619
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:10,783
Mr. Iron Flute

620
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:14,887
You're hurt? Got ambushed?

621
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:18,058
Why are you asking me?
Since you've observed it

622
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:24,593
I don't like to attack people
behind their back

623
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:26,464
If they didn't attack me from behind

624
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,197
There's no way they could hurt me

625
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:32,533
You're very arrogant

626
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:38,040
I don't want to harm you
since you're hurt

627
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:40,446
But I must teach you a lesson...

628
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:42,518
for being arrogant

629
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:48,254
Since you're hurt,
I'll let you take three moves first

630
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,767
Why are you leaving?

631
00:48:58,368 --> 00:49:00,529
I don't want you to die here

632
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:03,234
Why would I die?

633
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,865
Because no one can take my three moves

634
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:09,769
You want to try?

635
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:17,546
Forget 3, no one can take one move

636
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:23,885
I said I'll let you
take three moves first

637
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:26,485
That was one

638
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,559
Two more

639
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:38,565
Two

640
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:39,573
Three

641
00:49:41,044 --> 00:49:44,878
Fine, that's it

642
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:13,941
lmpressive! You were right

643
00:50:14,044 --> 00:50:15,602
It's hard to hurt you unless from behind

644
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:20,214
I've learnt one thing today

645
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:22,547
I can't let anyone
to take three moves first

646
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:27,380
And you should have learnt one thing

647
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:32,155
Every move should be fatal

648
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:51,103
Mr. Iron Flute,
have you met the young man?

649
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:52,812
Yes

650
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:55,143
Did you kill him?

651
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:57,552
No

652
00:50:57,654 --> 00:51:00,817
I'm here to kill Li Xunhuan

653
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,195
Xunhuan

654
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:15,730
Why would they let me out
of the stock room

655
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,238
...and drink here?

656
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:18,435
I heard that Master Xinmei...

657
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:20,407
will arrive tonight

658
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:21,841
You'll go to Shaolin Temple tomorrow

659
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:23,310
No he won't

660
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:29,378
Why not?

661
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,852
Because I'll kill him tonight

662
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:36,383
Mr. Iron Flute

663
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:43,389
Why don't you ask me
why I want you dead?

664
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:47,395
I don't want to offend you.
And anyway...

665
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:50,439
If I explain anything,
you won't believe me

666
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:51,939
Then why would I bother!

667
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:54,909
Right, I'd kill you no matter what

668
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:36,944
Mr. Iron Flute

669
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:44,290
No wonder my younger brother
died at your hands

670
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:46,157
You're very good

671
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:50,024
So I killed your brother

672
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:53,432
You should tell me

673
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:55,232
What does he look like

674
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,306
So that I can say hello to him in hell

675
00:52:57,407 --> 00:52:58,374
Bullshit

676
00:53:08,785 --> 00:53:10,753
Amitabha Buddha

677
00:53:12,255 --> 00:53:13,722
Master Xinmei

678
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:19,726
Master Iron Flute,

679
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:22,798
why the rush to kill Li Xunhuan?

680
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:25,658
I must avenge for my brother

681
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:30,667
I heard that you'll always get even

682
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:33,106
You'd never do anyone any favors

683
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,804
I wonder if you could make this
an exception

684
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:39,075
Let me and Li Xunhuan
go to Shaolin Temple

685
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:40,979
Because my chief said
he doesn't believe...

686
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:44,178
Li Xunhuan to be the Plum Blossom Bandit

687
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:49,254
Fine. With you here...

688
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,793
It won't be easy for me to kill him

689
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:55,228
But if you're sure that
he's the Plum Blossom Bandit

690
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:58,096
...then I want to be the one to kill him

691
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:04,537
Thank you

692
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:50,213
Where am I?

693
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:54,414
The guest room

694
00:54:57,894 --> 00:54:59,293
You saved me?

695
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:01,330
You fainted outside

696
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:06,263
Where are my clothes?

697
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:09,202
I helped you change

698
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:15,507
I feel dizzy

699
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:17,239
Take a nap

700
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:37,432
What is it, Zhaolong?

701
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:38,660
Our master said that...

702
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:41,601
Li Xunhuan will head for Shaolin tomorrow

703
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:48,808
Take the Gold Threaded Vest
to your master

704
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:51,506
Inform him that Ah Fei is injured;
that he's here

705
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:53,548
I'll make sure he recovers slowly

706
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:54,344
Yes

707
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:58,646
Inform the Five Poisons Kid

708
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:01,087
That Li Xunhuan will be
on the road tomorrow

709
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,920
Tell them to kill him on the way

710
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:06,189
100,000 taels of gold,
5 pearls will be delivered soon

711
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:07,263
Yes

712
00:56:09,499 --> 00:56:12,935
Li Xunhuan, you must die

713
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:24,845
Take care of yourself on the road

714
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:26,415
Don't drink too much

715
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:28,341
I know

716
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:30,112
Why don't you clamp his vital points?

717
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,312
Lock him up in chains

718
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:31,910
That's right

719
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:33,147
It's not necessary

720
00:56:33,256 --> 00:56:35,224
He might run

721
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:39,728
He'd be already gone if he wished

722
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:53,341
Chuanjia, what are you doing here?

723
00:56:53,643 --> 00:56:56,271
I heard that the master
will head for Shaolin today

724
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:58,108
I'm here to escort

725
00:56:59,182 --> 00:57:02,709
It's an arduous journey

726
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:05,913
Twenty years I've worked for you

727
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:08,320
However tough the journey, I'm not afraid

728
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:13,585
Very loyal indeed!

729
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:18,325
Let's go, Master Li

730
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,428
Another bowl

731
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:51,825
Come... serve the guests

732
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:53,630
Master, they don't have the wine you like

733
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:54,794
Only the local stuff

734
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:55,836
It's fine

735
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:01,703
Don't touch anything

736
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:04,905
What's going on?

737
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:06,003
It's poisoned

738
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:11,312
How do you know?

739
00:58:13,456 --> 00:58:14,548
Look

740
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:20,292
Who did this?

741
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:20,760
I um...

742
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:21,796
Speak up

743
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:27,131
Not him, or he'd be gone already

744
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:28,795
What do you think he's staying here for?

745
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:31,606
Right, I don't know what happened

746
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:33,073
My brother cooked the dishes

747
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:36,438
That's my brother

748
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:43,117
What's going on?

749
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:45,210
Who did this?

750
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:48,955
Look

751
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:55,390
Five Poisons Kid

752
00:58:55,498 --> 00:58:56,192
That's him

753
00:58:56,299 --> 00:58:58,130
Looks like you've got friends

754
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:00,429
But you've got more enemies

755
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:03,535
I've heard that the Five Poisons Kid

756
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,733
...has many ways to poison a person

757
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:08,333
And if he is determined
to kill someone...

758
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:10,036
then the person will die for sure

759
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:14,780
That's right. Unless he never eats!

760
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:00,393
Let's take a break here

761
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:01,793
Sure

762
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:04,264
Let's take a break here

763
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:07,336
You have a rest too, Master Li

764
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:22,080
Master Tian, you must be starving

765
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:26,619
Of course. We haven't eaten in three days

766
01:00:54,784 --> 01:00:57,719
Old man, here's 10 taels

767
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,879
Can I have the steamed buns?

768
01:01:00,456 --> 01:01:01,582
Ten taels?

769
01:01:01,691 --> 01:01:04,159
That's right

770
01:01:12,635 --> 01:01:14,762
Dear, honey

771
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:16,532
We have ten taels

772
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:20,166
Look, we've got food

773
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:21,872
You can't eat the buns

774
01:01:25,648 --> 01:01:27,138
Nonsense

775
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:30,310
You saw him eating it

776
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,080
But we can't eat it

777
01:01:33,723 --> 01:01:36,658
Because the Five Poisons Kid
isn't after him

778
01:01:36,759 --> 01:01:40,195
How come he won't be poisoned?

779
01:01:40,296 --> 01:01:41,854
There's antidote in the soup

780
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:44,632
He drank the soup beforehand

781
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:07,784
How do you know it's poisoned?

782
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,916
I know the man has left

783
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:12,187
The house is empty

784
01:02:18,768 --> 01:02:20,030
Steamed buns

785
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:22,696
Steamed buns

786
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:28,504
Fresh and hot

787
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:34,641
Steamed buns

788
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,719
Behave children

789
01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:39,253
Come here and eat your noodles. Be quiet

790
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:41,913
I'll give you five taels

791
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:43,184
I'll take the buns

792
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:45,590
That...

793
01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:48,290
Since the children want to eat the buns

794
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:49,989
I'll swap the buns with noodles

795
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:51,864
That won't be fair to you

796
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:52,696
Never mind

797
01:02:53,136 --> 01:02:54,296
Say thank you

798
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:55,631
Thank you!

799
01:02:56,539 --> 01:03:00,031
Let's go eat the buns, open up

800
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:05,012
I think I can have these noodles now

801
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:13,320
If the Five Poisons Kid
could predict that

802
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:15,720
the kids don't want to eat the noodles

803
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:18,988
and that I'd swap with them

804
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:21,586
And he's poisoned the noodles

805
01:03:21,898 --> 01:03:24,696
Then I have nothing to say even I'll die

806
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:26,298
Go on

807
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:29,337
Let's eat

808
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:31,366
I know what you're trying to do

809
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:32,964
You want us to starve

810
01:03:33,075 --> 01:03:34,633
So that you can escape easily

811
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:36,309
You can't eat that, Master Tian

812
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:39,210
This place is deserted

813
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:42,284
There's not another house around here

814
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:43,943
You know, if I'd want to poison someone

815
01:03:44,053 --> 01:03:45,213
...I'd rather do it here

816
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,017
Go take a look inside

817
01:03:48,124 --> 01:03:49,751
I think the whole family is gone

818
01:03:58,634 --> 01:04:01,899
It's really empty

819
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:33,067
Finally we're almost there

820
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:35,201
I don't understand you.
Why do you insist...

821
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:37,272
on bringing my master to Shaolin temple?

822
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:40,065
We invited Master Li

823
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:40,870
...because there've been thefts

824
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:44,208
of martial arts scriptures
in Shaolin Temple

825
01:04:44,313 --> 01:04:46,281
What's that got to do
with the Plum Blossom Bandit?

826
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:48,077
When the scripture thief

827
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:49,913
...killed our people,

828
01:04:50,019 --> 01:04:51,884
He left a mark of the Plum Blossom Bandit

829
01:04:51,988 --> 01:04:53,683
You think my master
is the Plum Blossom Bandit?

830
01:04:53,789 --> 01:04:56,815
No, but I do suspect someone

831
01:04:56,926 --> 01:05:00,054
I haven't said anything
for I've got no proof

832
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:04,488
If anything happens to me...

833
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,568
please tell my fellow Shaolin disciples

834
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:07,931
The name of the suspect is written

835
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:10,130
...on the last page of my journal

836
01:05:10,873 --> 01:05:13,671
The last page of yourjournal

837
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:18,239
Throw it away, don't touch it

838
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,239
A poisonous toad... Run!

839
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:25,982
Chuanjia

840
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:29,785
Master, I think I've been poisoned

841
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:41,433
You must be working for
the Five Poisons Kid

842
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:42,663
That's right

843
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:18,974
Chuanjia

844
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:22,806
I know I'm dying

845
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:24,539
Take care of yourself

846
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:27,207
Chuanjia...

847
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:29,173
Look

848
01:06:30,019 --> 01:06:33,147
Poor snake

849
01:06:33,255 --> 01:06:37,749
It's a shame...

850
01:06:51,941 --> 01:06:53,067
Are you the Five Poisons Kid?

851
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:56,440
That's right

852
01:06:57,513 --> 01:07:01,950
I've been expecting you...

853
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:07,455
for I promised someone I'll kill you

854
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:08,954
Master, be careful

855
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:12,220
Five poisonous cold needles

856
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:15,587
You know quite a lot

857
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,601
Don't worry about me, just run!

858
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:40,647
The Legendary Master Li and your daggers

859
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:44,541
Master Li, I'm delighted to meet you

860
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:46,280
Thank you

861
01:08:46,388 --> 01:08:50,188
Master, I'm just an ordinary man

862
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:53,489
I'm lucky to meet you today

863
01:08:53,596 --> 01:08:54,858
It's a pleasure

864
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:56,625
There's no need to be so modest

865
01:08:56,732 --> 01:09:00,327
Thank you for escorting
Master Xinmei here

866
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:02,461
I appreciate it very much

867
01:09:02,571 --> 01:09:04,038
You're very welcome

868
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:05,168
Master

869
01:09:05,274 --> 01:09:07,435
How do you know
he didn't hurt Master Xinmei?

870
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:09,067
Shut up

871
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:12,204
Don't you know that Master Xinmei...

872
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:14,839
has been poisoned
by Five Poisons Needles?

873
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:20,513
Anyone could have poisoned him

874
01:09:20,623 --> 01:09:21,851
You are right

875
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,820
Do you think that...

876
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:27,157
I've hurt Master Xinmei?

877
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:30,357
Only you could answer that

878
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:32,491
No, someone else can give you an answer

879
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:33,465
Who?

880
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:36,534
Master Xinmei himself

881
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:39,107
Why don't you ask him when he wakes up?

882
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:47,542
Time for dinner

883
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:19,673
Where do you think you're going?

884
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:30,758
What happened?

885
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:33,017
You killed Master Xinmei
while we were eating

886
01:10:33,128 --> 01:10:36,655
And you're pretending you didn't do it?

887
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:37,799
What?

888
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:38,730
Get him

889
01:10:56,518 --> 01:10:57,542
Stop it

890
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:04,519
Master Li

891
01:11:04,627 --> 01:11:07,289
What's going on?

892
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:10,054
Master Xinmei was killed

893
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:11,792
You're the murderer

894
01:11:12,534 --> 01:11:13,558
You're wrong

895
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:16,194
About the scriptures thief,
Master Xinmei said...

896
01:11:16,305 --> 01:11:19,331
He has the name of the suspect

897
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:21,068
He's written the name on the last page

898
01:11:21,176 --> 01:11:23,144
...of his journal

899
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:32,453
The last page has been torn off!

900
01:11:32,921 --> 01:11:33,546
That's simple

901
01:11:33,656 --> 01:11:36,591
I would tear out the last page...

902
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:38,216
and make up a story if I was the murderer

903
01:11:39,428 --> 01:11:42,192
How would the thief know...

904
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:44,698
about Master Xinmei's journal?

905
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:13,458
You can get up now

906
01:12:15,564 --> 01:12:18,158
Do you want your golden vest back?

907
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:20,895
No, I'm here to see you

908
01:12:32,614 --> 01:12:36,573
I always thought
flowers are the most beautiful...

909
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:43,984
things on earth...
but today I've seen a woman

910
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:45,726
...who is more beautiful than flowers

911
01:12:46,161 --> 01:12:47,958
You think I'm pretty?

912
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:57,403
Have you been in love before?

913
01:12:59,108 --> 01:13:00,097
No

914
01:13:00,809 --> 01:13:02,868
You know nothing about me

915
01:13:06,181 --> 01:13:08,206
I was in a coma for the past few days

916
01:13:09,251 --> 01:13:12,118
This is the first time we've spoken

917
01:13:13,422 --> 01:13:16,050
Don't ponder upon this

918
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:18,591
Don't move

919
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:24,892
What is it?

920
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:30,532
There's a poisonous spider on your neck

921
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:35,268
Thank you

922
01:13:45,788 --> 01:13:48,018
It's so strange

923
01:13:48,123 --> 01:13:49,488
A poisonous spider
in such a beautiful environment

924
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:54,793
You can'tjudge a book by its cover

925
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:57,897
I've heard that
poppy is a pretty flower too

926
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:03,265
You were holding the spiderjust now

927
01:14:03,372 --> 01:14:05,966
If you got bitten, you could die

928
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:11,311
Hmm, I didn't think about that at all

929
01:14:12,881 --> 01:14:14,906
Maybe I was in a hurry

930
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:21,951
There's only one kind of love...

931
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:24,591
which makes you disregard your own life

932
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:27,527
That's the love between a man and a woman

933
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:31,324
You'll understand more later

934
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:35,532
But I'll always remember that

935
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:37,332
You've saved my life today

936
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:40,272
And I'll remember you've been kind to me

937
01:14:41,543 --> 01:14:42,407
So...

938
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:44,638
Have you heard anything about Master Li?

939
01:14:48,283 --> 01:14:50,877
Why do you care about Li Xunhuan so much?

940
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:53,587
Because he's my only friend

941
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:59,452
I heard that Master Xinmei was murdered

942
01:15:00,295 --> 01:15:02,695
Shaolin Temple has kept
Master Li in house arrest

943
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:05,690
...until they've found
the Plum Blossom Bandit

944
01:15:08,403 --> 01:15:11,702
Now that a second Bandit has surfaced...

945
01:15:11,807 --> 01:15:13,035
It's proof enough that,

946
01:15:13,141 --> 01:15:14,870
Li Xunhuan is not the Plum Blossom Bandit

947
01:15:16,545 --> 01:15:16,977
Would you know of anyone...

948
01:15:17,079 --> 01:15:18,876
who is rich and nasty that
I should kill?

949
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:30,257
You are Shen Laosan?

950
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,824
Do you know why I'm here?

951
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:49,477
Let go

952
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:53,579
From Shaolin?

953
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:57,678
Stop it, master

954
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:02,755
Why do you want to catch him?

955
01:16:03,258 --> 01:16:04,987
He's the accomplice of
the Plum Blossom Bandit

956
01:16:05,093 --> 01:16:06,492
Of course we can catch him

957
01:16:06,595 --> 01:16:09,257
My friend is innocent

958
01:16:10,365 --> 01:16:12,162
I hope you'll let him go

959
01:16:12,267 --> 01:16:14,963
If he's the Plum Blossom Bandit

960
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:18,130
Then you're his accomplice;
just as guilty

961
01:16:18,807 --> 01:16:21,571
Zhao Zhengyi, you've gone too far

962
01:16:21,677 --> 01:16:22,701
What if I have?

963
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:27,045
You must be fair

964
01:16:27,149 --> 01:16:29,549
For your namesake

965
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:32,415
You can't bully someone like this

966
01:16:44,967 --> 01:16:48,095
Master Zhao, no one else is here

967
01:16:48,203 --> 01:16:51,400
No spies, only you

968
01:18:16,758 --> 01:18:17,850
What do you want?

969
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:20,324
We want to nab the Plum Blossom Bandit

970
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:21,657
We want to find the scriptures stealer

971
01:18:22,631 --> 01:18:25,327
What if they are two different persons?

972
01:18:25,434 --> 01:18:27,868
If we can locate the scriptures

973
01:18:27,969 --> 01:18:30,164
I promise you, Shaolin won't get involved

974
01:18:30,272 --> 01:18:33,139
You must return the scriptures
in three days

975
01:18:33,608 --> 01:18:35,735
Three days? That's a long time

976
01:18:36,511 --> 01:18:37,876
I only need an hour

977
01:18:45,187 --> 01:18:45,812
Yuanfeng

978
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:47,252
Yes master

979
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:52,453
Search the rooms of Dongning Chambers

980
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:53,289
Yes master

981
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:54,629
Follow me

982
01:18:55,163 --> 01:18:56,994
Why are you searching our rooms?

983
01:18:57,099 --> 01:19:00,034
Because Master Xinmei told me

984
01:19:00,135 --> 01:19:02,501
...you are the scriptures stealers

985
01:19:03,105 --> 01:19:06,404
The Yijin Scripture which was stolen...

986
01:19:06,508 --> 01:19:07,736
recently is still inside this temple

987
01:19:09,511 --> 01:19:11,001
Master, we've found the scriptures

988
01:19:11,113 --> 01:19:12,239
...in their rooms

989
01:19:12,948 --> 01:19:15,576
They must have planted
the stolen scriptures

990
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:27,922
Here's the Yijin Scripture

991
01:19:28,029 --> 01:19:29,257
We've been framed for sure

992
01:19:30,832 --> 01:19:32,197
How would you know that...

993
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:34,131
where we placed the scriptures?

994
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:36,930
Look, they are not the scripture stealers

995
01:19:37,038 --> 01:19:38,505
Wouldn't find even if they try hard

996
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:41,703
I'd say, even if
we planted the scriptures here

997
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:44,301
We couldn't have placed it
in the secret compartment

998
01:19:51,086 --> 01:19:55,250
Master Xinmei has told me that...

999
01:19:55,357 --> 01:19:58,053
He suspects the scriptures stealer
is an insider

1000
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:00,787
One who has access to the library

1001
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:04,332
And only the senior masters
at Dongning Chambers

1002
01:20:04,699 --> 01:20:07,566
...are eligible;
that's why I took a risk

1003
01:20:08,036 --> 01:20:10,937
If Mater Xinjian would've been
a little more calm...

1004
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:13,007
My plan wouldn't work

1005
01:20:19,881 --> 01:20:20,472
Don't move

1006
01:20:20,582 --> 01:20:21,879
Let me get hold of
the Plum Blossom Bandit

1007
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:27,811
Don't move

1008
01:20:30,392 --> 01:20:32,121
Master Zhao,
if you want to take the credit

1009
01:20:32,227 --> 01:20:34,491
I'll pass him to your custody later

1010
01:20:36,298 --> 01:20:38,732
The martial world wouldn't have
that many grudges

1011
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:40,597
...if not for people like them

1012
01:20:40,702 --> 01:20:43,330
A bunch of hypocrites!

1013
01:20:43,438 --> 01:20:44,462
Let's go

1014
01:20:49,945 --> 01:20:50,934
Wait

1015
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:56,776
I've promised Master Xinmei...

1016
01:20:56,885 --> 01:20:58,648
that I'd catch the scriptures stealers

1017
01:20:59,387 --> 01:21:02,356
A promise is a promise

1018
01:21:04,059 --> 01:21:07,859
C'mon, let's see
how you actually catch me

1019
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:14,627
Don't move

1020
01:21:18,773 --> 01:21:19,740
Come on

1021
01:21:31,419 --> 01:21:35,788
Who's the Plum Blossom Bandit?
Who told you to steal?

1022
01:21:43,431 --> 01:21:44,420
What did he say?

1023
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:49,400
He said it's me

1024
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:53,397
What are you trying to do?

1025
01:21:53,508 --> 01:21:54,839
To seize the Plum Blossom Bandit

1026
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:56,074
You are too rash

1027
01:21:56,177 --> 01:21:57,735
I'll kill you if you move again

1028
01:21:58,013 --> 01:21:59,605
You...

1029
01:22:08,657 --> 01:22:11,091
Ever thought the Bandit
perhaps mightn't be a man?

1030
01:22:11,559 --> 01:22:13,083
Not a man? Then what?

1031
01:22:13,194 --> 01:22:15,662
A woman of course

1032
01:22:16,898 --> 01:22:17,956
A woman?

1033
01:22:18,066 --> 01:22:20,000
Right... since the beginning

1034
01:22:20,101 --> 01:22:23,696
The Plum Blossom Bandit
has been trying to set you up

1035
01:22:23,805 --> 01:22:24,863
And these people who are against us

1036
01:22:24,973 --> 01:22:27,965
...are all male, martial arts experts

1037
01:22:28,677 --> 01:22:31,339
Only a very beautiful woman...

1038
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:33,710
Could make this happen

1039
01:22:34,249 --> 01:22:36,183
And there's only one woman
who knows that...

1040
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:38,149
I was going to kill Shen Laosan

1041
01:23:02,477 --> 01:23:05,469
I heard the news from Shaolin Temple

1042
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:07,377
I knew you'd come here to look for me

1043
01:23:22,297 --> 01:23:23,958
You've been trying to kill Master Li...
why?

1044
01:23:24,065 --> 01:23:26,363
He killed my father

1045
01:23:26,468 --> 01:23:27,560
Who might he be?

1046
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:30,001
My father worked for
the Plum Blossom Bandit

1047
01:23:30,105 --> 01:23:33,438
You killed him ten years ago by Tai Lake

1048
01:23:35,076 --> 01:23:37,567
That's why you try to set him up

1049
01:23:37,746 --> 01:23:38,906
There was a monk called...

1050
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:41,710
Xinjian who contacted me

1051
01:23:41,816 --> 01:23:45,411
He said that
the Plum Blossom Bandit is still alive

1052
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,148
I could have my revenge. We set up a trap

1053
01:23:48,256 --> 01:23:49,621
...for you

1054
01:23:50,425 --> 01:23:52,188
We used the martial arts experts...

1055
01:23:52,293 --> 01:23:55,228
as pawns. They all lust after beauty

1056
01:23:55,330 --> 01:23:57,821
Then the deaths of Zhao Zhengyi's son

1057
01:23:58,233 --> 01:23:59,700
...and Mr. Iron Flute's brother

1058
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:02,229
We were hoping that they'd get rid of you

1059
01:24:03,304 --> 01:24:05,534
So you knew
who's the Plum Blossom Bandit all along?

1060
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:06,800
No. Didn't have a clue

1061
01:24:06,908 --> 01:24:09,536
I've only contacted Monk Xinjian

1062
01:24:10,145 --> 01:24:13,444
Now it doesn't matter
who's the Plum Blossom Bandit

1063
01:24:14,449 --> 01:24:16,610
Because I must kill you

1064
01:24:20,655 --> 01:24:23,089
I'd advise you not to

1065
01:24:23,191 --> 01:24:24,988
Because even if you practise for
another 10 years

1066
01:24:25,093 --> 01:24:26,685
You're not Master Li's match

1067
01:24:26,795 --> 01:24:27,955
That's my problem

1068
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:35,832
Miss Lin, have you ever thought that...

1069
01:24:35,937 --> 01:24:38,030
I did everyone a favor
by killing your father?

1070
01:24:38,139 --> 01:24:39,299
He's my father after all

1071
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:55,848
Miss Lin, I owe you a favor

1072
01:24:55,957 --> 01:24:57,356
I don't wish to see you die here

1073
01:24:57,459 --> 01:24:58,687
You better leave

1074
01:25:06,734 --> 01:25:09,828
Mr. Iron Flute, you heard her

1075
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:13,806
She's the one who killed your brother

1076
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:22,815
What are you doing?

1077
01:25:22,917 --> 01:25:23,815
Avenging my brother

1078
01:25:23,918 --> 01:25:26,580
I didn't kill him

1079
01:25:26,688 --> 01:25:28,383
The real Plum Blossom Bandit did

1080
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:29,113
Who'd believe you?

1081
01:25:29,224 --> 01:25:30,191
Come on then

1082
01:25:32,727 --> 01:25:33,591
You all spread out

1083
01:25:36,097 --> 01:25:38,395
Mr. Iron Flute, this is a duel

1084
01:25:56,084 --> 01:25:57,016
C'mon, move

1085
01:25:59,921 --> 01:26:00,717
Wait

1086
01:26:01,055 --> 01:26:04,252
Mr. Iron Flute, Zhao Zhengyi,
if you want your revenge,

1087
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:06,259
you should find the real killer

1088
01:26:07,061 --> 01:26:08,323
Where is the real killer?

1089
01:26:08,429 --> 01:26:09,327
I know

1090
01:26:10,532 --> 01:26:11,362
Shiyin

1091
01:26:13,067 --> 01:26:15,797
Cousin, I think you know who's the real

1092
01:26:15,904 --> 01:26:17,201
...Plum Blossom Bandit

1093
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:20,739
Tell them

1094
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:22,400
I will if you don't

1095
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:26,469
Shiyin

1096
01:26:30,151 --> 01:26:32,813
- Shiyin...
- Miss Lin

1097
01:26:33,121 --> 01:26:34,247
Shiyin

1098
01:26:35,423 --> 01:26:39,189
Cousin, you...

1099
01:26:39,294 --> 01:26:41,592
You should know

1100
01:26:41,696 --> 01:26:48,499
You... it's been ten years...

1101
01:26:49,337 --> 01:26:50,634
Shiyin

1102
01:27:15,029 --> 01:27:16,053
Wait

1103
01:27:24,305 --> 01:27:25,772
Don't go

1104
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:28,204
I know where he is

1105
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:31,777
I'll take care of it

1106
01:27:51,032 --> 01:27:54,297
I've been expecting you

1107
01:27:54,402 --> 01:27:56,199
Why did you kill Shiyin?

1108
01:27:56,304 --> 01:27:57,635
That's because...

1109
01:27:57,739 --> 01:28:00,230
I must kill all those who know my secret

1110
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:02,508
That includes you

1111
01:28:06,047 --> 01:28:07,605
This duel should have...

1112
01:28:07,715 --> 01:28:10,775
taken place ten years ago at Tai Lake

1113
01:28:11,386 --> 01:28:14,651
Nevertheless it's happening today

1114
01:28:17,425 --> 01:28:18,687
So you're the real Plum Blossom Bandit?

1115
01:28:18,793 --> 01:28:23,127
Yes, you tried to catch me ten years ago

1116
01:28:23,231 --> 01:28:25,961
I knew I was no match for you then

1117
01:28:26,801 --> 01:28:29,099
That's why I set a trap

1118
01:28:29,203 --> 01:28:31,103
And pretended to save your life

1119
01:28:31,205 --> 01:28:33,537
Then I've been living in Xingyin Manor

1120
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:37,441
I sent Xinjian to steal
the scriptures from Shaolin

1121
01:28:37,545 --> 01:28:40,275
And I've been practising all these years

1122
01:28:40,548 --> 01:28:43,483
So even if you attempt to
take my life today...

1123
01:28:44,686 --> 01:28:47,246
It won't be as easy as ten years back

1124
01:28:48,056 --> 01:28:51,514
So you've never loved Shiyin!

1125
01:28:51,626 --> 01:28:52,854
No

1126
01:28:53,661 --> 01:28:57,893
And frankly speaking,
I didn't save your life then

1127
01:28:58,933 --> 01:29:00,924
Ten years ago...

1128
01:29:01,035 --> 01:29:03,230
At the time when you thought I saved you;

1129
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:09,072
It was in fact
the beginning of a revenge.

1130
01:29:09,177 --> 01:29:10,474
Only that I used sentiments
rather than weapons

1131
01:29:17,251 --> 01:29:21,210
However, when it comes to
using sentiments...

1132
01:29:21,322 --> 01:29:25,019
You've got to be like me... heartless!

1133
01:29:26,094 --> 01:29:28,722
Otherwise I'd be like you

1134
01:29:28,830 --> 01:29:31,731
Your whole life's been controlled
by sentiments

1135
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:34,893
You were living in regrets and pain

1136
01:29:36,838 --> 01:29:39,636
Before Xinjian died, he told me that...

1137
01:29:39,741 --> 01:29:43,905
you're the Plum Blossom Bandit. I didn't

1138
01:29:44,011 --> 01:29:46,002
...blow your cover for
I still had faith in you

1139
01:29:47,281 --> 01:29:50,182
That's your main weakness

1140
01:29:51,552 --> 01:29:55,682
You believe in sentiments among people

1141
01:29:56,824 --> 01:30:00,316
You easily gave up the woman you love...

1142
01:30:00,428 --> 01:30:03,056
and your property and wealth

1143
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:10,827
Of course, the world might say
you're sentimental

1144
01:30:10,938 --> 01:30:14,601
But you're just a silly fool

1145
01:30:16,544 --> 01:30:20,036
Let me tell you once again

1146
01:30:20,148 --> 01:30:24,608
You can't be a sentimental swordsman

1147
01:30:26,387 --> 01:30:29,948
And the sword you wield...

1148
01:30:30,558 --> 01:30:32,890
ought to be a merciless one

1149
01:30:38,132 --> 01:30:43,695
Are you done with your tale,
Long Xiaoyun?

1150
01:30:43,805 --> 01:30:45,432
I said that before

1151
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:49,641
It's a simple story...

1152
01:30:49,744 --> 01:30:52,269
about revenge of the Plum Blossom Bandit

1153
01:30:53,781 --> 01:30:58,616
Now it's my turn to tell my story

1154
01:31:02,857 --> 01:31:06,224
I want to know how you dodged my daggers

1155
01:31:12,567 --> 01:31:15,764
Little Li's Legendary Dagger,
Never a miss!

1156
01:31:16,370 --> 01:31:20,101
You never expected me to use this magnet

1157
01:31:25,546 --> 01:31:29,539
The last 10 years
I managed to find a lot about you

1158
01:31:30,351 --> 01:31:35,220
You never carry more than 12 daggers

1159
01:31:58,913 --> 01:32:01,746
There's a sword at the back

1160
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:08,655
To kill an unarmed man

1161
01:32:08,756 --> 01:32:10,087
It's something very novel to me

1162
01:33:10,051 --> 01:33:13,179
I wanted to use Lin Xianer's eagerness
for revenge

1163
01:33:13,287 --> 01:33:14,049
And I also wanted to
exploit the hypocrites

1164
01:33:14,155 --> 01:33:16,783
...as my pawns

1165
01:33:16,891 --> 01:33:18,415
But I'd never have thought that...

1166
01:33:18,526 --> 01:33:20,585
I have to kill you personally

1167
01:34:17,485 --> 01:34:20,750
I've told you before, I must kill you

1168
01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:26,688
Because you're sentimental,
and I'm ruthless

1169
01:34:34,235 --> 01:34:36,396
Another sentimental man

1170
01:34:42,910 --> 01:34:43,899
Don't move

1171
01:34:52,653 --> 01:34:56,419
Maybe you didn't think
I've the Gold Threaded Vest

1172
01:34:56,524 --> 01:34:57,491
Hold it!

1173
01:34:58,759 --> 01:35:00,750
If you step one inch further

1174
01:35:00,861 --> 01:35:02,590
I swear that this broken sword

1175
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:04,426
...will be pierced through your throat

1176
01:35:11,105 --> 01:35:13,198
The magnet is too far away

1177
01:35:13,574 --> 01:35:16,737
Even with the broken sword...

1178
01:35:16,844 --> 01:35:19,472
I still have time to kill him

1179
01:36:10,598 --> 01:36:12,327
Although you could avoid...

1180
01:36:12,433 --> 01:36:15,459
all the man-made weapons

1181
01:36:15,803 --> 01:36:18,101
But you can't escape

1182
01:36:18,205 --> 01:36:20,366
...from the ice made by the gods!
