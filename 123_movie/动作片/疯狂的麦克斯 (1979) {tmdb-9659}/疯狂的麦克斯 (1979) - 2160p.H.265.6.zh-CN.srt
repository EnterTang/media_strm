我能存在于这个不毛之地
So I exist in this wasteland...

26
00:03:11,077 --> 00:03:15,057
就是因为我仅存的本能：

They have my blood.
还抢走我的车！
Now it's my car!

144
00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:27,040
不朽！
Immortan!

145
00:17:28,085 --> 00:17:30,016
不死老乔！
Immortan Joe!

146
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:34,038
他看了我一眼！
He looked at me!

147
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:37,093
他看了我一眼！
He looked right at me! 
他看的是你的血包！
He was staring at your Blood Bag!

148
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,061
他回了头！直视着我的眼睛！
He turned his head! He looked
me straight in the eye!!

149
00:17:40,073 --> 00:17:42,091
他只是看着地平线！
He was scanning the horizon!

150
00:17:43,032 --> 00:17:44,040
不
No.

151
00:17:44,086 --> 00:17:45,095
我期待着！
I am awaited!

152
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,056
我期待着进入英灵殿！

153
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,005

154
00:17:55,068 --> 00:17:56,074
不朽

老大！
Boss!

158
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:31,014
我看到从大本营里出来的车辆 他们发射了信号弹
We got vehicles from the Citadel. They're firing flares.

159
00:18:31,067 --> 00:18:34,053
看起来他们要给汽油镇和子弹农场增员
They want reinforcements from Gas Town and the Bullet Farm.

160
00:18:34,092 --> 00:18:35,093
怎么回事？
What is this??

161
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:37,018
支援？诱饵？
Backup? Decoy??

162
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,017
这是个迂回
It's a detour.

163
00:18:55,048 --> 00:18:58,041
那辆武装车想对我们做什么？
What's this War Rig doing on our patch!?

164
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:02,091
作死 但是随时欢迎
Foolish...but welcome

165
00:19:16,063 --> 00:19:17,071
秃鹫帮派！

秃鹫帮派在右边！注意！注意！
Buzzards right!! Eyes on! Eyes on!!

167
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:27,062
我们是不是该掉头和后援会和？
Should we turn around and
run 'em into our backup?

168
00:19:30,014 --> 00:19:31,055
不需要！我们可以做到
No! We're good.

169
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,050
我们会击败他们！
We fang it!!

170
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,007
全速前进！我们走！

She's ours Slit! She's ours!!

176
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,023
我们首先要干掉她后面的秃鹫帮派！
First, we get the buzzards off her back!

177
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,041
准备投掷！
Ready to throw!

178
00:21:42,033 --> 00:21:43,057
那可是我的脑袋！
That's my head!!!

179
00:22:18,094 --> 00:22:20,075
振作起来！你能做到的！
Get up! You can do it!

180
00:22:25,096 --> 00:22:27,007

Mediocre!!!!

187

他们来啦！
They are coming!

189
00:23:50,052 --> 00:23:52,023
我们在下面没法呼吸了！
We can't breathe down there!!

190
00:23:52,074 --> 00:23:54,012
别让他们发现你！

她以为她能甩掉我们的父亲！

她以为我们很蠢！

Burn them! Burn them!

207
00:26:55,053 --> 00:26:56,053

00:45:53,011 --> 00:45:55,025
不！我活过 我死了 但我又重生了！
No! I live,
I die, I live again!!

286
00:45:56,016 --> 00:45:57,048
控制住他！把他捆起来！
Hold him! I Tie him up!

287
00:45:57,073 --> 00:45:58,078
把他扔出去！
Throw him out!

288
00:45:59,018 --> 00:46:00,019
扔出去！
Throw him!

289
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:03,005
你们有伴了
You got more friends.

290
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:06,080
子弹农夫
Bullet Farmer.

291
00:46:07,024 --> 00:46:09,024
他们从子弹农场来的
They're coming from the Bullet Farm.
是吗？
Yeah?

292
00:46:10,029 --> 00:46:12,004
一切都结束了 你打不过他们！
It's over. You can't defy him!

293
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:13,067
你看着我们就行了！

294
00:46:13,075 --> 00:46:16,075
他就是那个占领太阳的人
He is the one who grabbed the sun.
他那么狡猾地耍了你！
Look how slick he's fooled you War Boy!

295
00:46:16,095 --> 00:46:18,007
他是个将死之人
He's a lying old man.

296
00:46:18,031 --> 00:46:19,084
在他的领导下我们都会崛起的！
By his hand we'll all be lifted up!

297
00:46:19,097 --> 00:46:22,031
这就是为什么我们身上会有他的纹身！
That's why we have his logo seared on our backs!

298
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:24,046
“种畜！”
"Breeding stock!"
“战争炮灰！”
"Battle fodder!"

299
00:46:26,036 --> 00:46:27,045
不 荣耀在等待着我！
No, I am awaited!!

300
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:29,025
你只是个将死之人的炮灰
You're an old man's battle fodder.

301
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,090
要做的就是除掉一切生灵！
Killing everyone and everything!!

302
00:46:30,092 --> 00:46:32,000
我们没有责任
We are not to blame.

303
00:46:32,006 --> 00:46:33,065
那是谁毁掉了世界？！
Then who killed the world?!!

304
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,085
我在前面有个交易
I made a deal up ahead.
Safe passage.

305
00:47:04,059 --> 00:47:06,022
不知道交易能不能成功
I don't know if it's still any good.

306
00:47:07,012 --> 00:47:08,034
大家都回到通道里
Get back in the hold.

307
00:47:08,057 --> 00:47:09,075
别关门
Keep the hatch open.

308
00:47:17,005 --> 00:47:18,010
我要你待在这里
I need you here.

309
00:47:20,073 --> 00:47:22,011
你可能要驾驶这辆卡车
You may have to drive the rig.

310
00:47:27,064 --> 00:47:28,065

你留在这
You stay there.

313
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,080
不论你做什么，都不要探头
Whatever you do, you can't be seen.

314
00:47:39,038 --> 00:47:40,090
我答应过我一个人去...
I'm supposed to be alone.

315
00:47:41,033 --> 00:47:42,068
完成这笔交易
That was the deal.

316
00:47:49,048 --> 00:47:50,057

Down here.

317
00:48:11,035 --> 00:48:12,035

你叫什么？
What's your name?

319
00:48:16,045 --> 00:48:17,084
我要怎么称呼你？
What do I call you?

320
00:48:18,084 --> 00:48:19,097
这重要吗？
Does it matter?

321
00:48:22,035 --> 00:48:23,035
好吧
Fine.

322
00:48:23,089 --> 00:48:25,020
待会我大喊“智障”
When I yell "Fool"...

323
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:27,051
你就马上开车走
you drive outta here
as fast as you can.

324
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:30,082
这是机关口令：
This is the sequence:

325
00:48:30,082 --> 00:48:33,012
1  1  2
One. One. Two.

326
00:48:33,057 --> 00:48:34,058

红  黑  启动
Red. Black. Go.

328

00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:06,028
全都在这了！
It's all here!

330
00:50:07,071 --> 00:50:10,048
照你的要求 3000加仑的汽油全在这了！
3000 gallons of guzzoline, just like you asked!

331
00:50:14,085 --> 00:50:16,025
我去把油管的链条剪开
I'm gonna unhitch the pod.

332
00:50:18,051 --> 00:50:19,081
你们等下就制造山崩
You drop the rocks.

333
00:50:28,069 --> 00:50:29,073

You said:

334
00:50:29,091 --> 00:50:33,017
“可能会有几辆车追你”
"A few vehicles in pursuit.Maybe."

335
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:35,078
我们数了一共有三个车队！
We count three war parties!!!

336
00:50:36,096 --> 00:50:39,019
是啊我真是不走运
Yeah well I got unlucky.

337
00:50:39,019 --> 00:50:40,032
让我们开始吧！
Let's do this!

338
00:51:06,055 --> 00:51:07,077

那是我们的燃料！
That's our fuel!!!

340
00:52:05,028 --> 00:52:06,099
用粗齿锯开路！
Open the way for Ripsaw!

341
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:23,047
一旦我们清理了岩石...
Once I'm over...

342
00:52:23,067 --> 00:52:25,082
就让大家通过
clear the rocks and lead everyone through.

343
00:52:25,082 --> 00:52:26,084
不朽！
Immortan!

344
00:52:28,001 --> 00:52:29,035
不死老乔！
Immortan Joe!

345
00:52:29,035 --> 00:52:32,074
这有个家伙！他说他曾在武装卡车上面

What is your name? 
我叫 Nux

378
00:57:04,014 --> 00:57:06,009
闪耀无比 光彩夺目

379
00:57:07,096 --> 00:57:08,096

我看到她被车轮碾过

399
00:59:27,072 --> 00:59:29,060
他根本不知道他在说什么！
He doesn't know what he's talking about!

400
00:59:30,022 --> 00:59:32,018
无论发生什么，我们都要去绿洲！
Whatever happens, we're going to the Green Place!

401
00:59:32,033 --> 00:59:34,074

停下来！
Stop!

406
01:00:32,052 --> 01:00:33,095
他会原谅我们 我知道他会的

407
01:00:34,006 --> 01:00:35,019
已经没有回头路了！
There's no going back!

408
01:00:35,056 --> 01:00:37,033
我们是他的珍宝！    Cheedo！
We were his treasures!   Cheedo!

409
01:00:37,058 --> 01:00:40,043
他给了我们保护！他给了我们奢华的生活！
We were protected! He gave us a life of luxury!

410
01:00:40,057 --> 01:00:42,035
这有什么错？         我们不是他的奴隶！
What's wrong with that?    We are not things!!

411
01:00:43,042 --> 01:00:44,042
不！

412
01:00:45,081 --> 01:00:47,027
Cheedo 我们不是他的奴隶！
Cheedo, we are not things!

413
01:00:47,044 --> 01:00:49,092
我们不是他的奴隶       我不想在听到这句话了！
We are not THINGS.   I don't want to hear that again!

414
01:00:50,005 --> 01:00:51,031
她就是这么教我们的！
They were her words!

415
01:00:51,062 --> 01:00:52,072
但她现在死了！
And now she's dead!

416
01:00:54,027 --> 01:00:57,019
无论你怎么抓狂 你都不能回去
Wring your hands and tear your hair,
but you're not going back there.

417
01:00:57,055 --> 01:00:59,021
你不能回去找他
You're not going back to him.

418
01:00:59,084 --> 01:01:00,084
Angharad!

419
01:01:00,086 --> 01:01:02,042
走吧
Come on!

420
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:25,005
那个绿洲...
where is this...

421
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:28,024
到底在什么地方？
this Green Place?

422
01:01:29,042 --> 01:01:31,056
航向向东 走一夜的路程
It's a long night's run, heading east.

423
01:01:34,009 --> 01:01:35,035
我们需要清点一下
We need inventory.

424
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:37,081
我要你检查所有的枪支弹药
I want you to match every
gun with it's bullets.

425
01:01:41,081 --> 01:01:43,058
我要下去做一些修补
I'm gonna go down and do some repairs.

426
01:01:43,067 --> 01:01:45,009
我们需要有人在后面望风

427
01:01:45,026 --> 01:01:46,026
我去
I'll go.

428
01:01:46,033 --> 01:01:47,012
不行
No.

429
01:01:47,028 --> 01:01:48,088
我要你和大家待在这里
I want you to stay together.

430
01:01:49,068 --> 01:01:50,084
我能做到的
I can do it.

431
01:02:24,004 --> 01:02:25,010
你在这干什么？
What are you doing here?

432
01:02:26,053 --> 01:02:27,084
我看到了
He saw it.

433
01:02:28,052 --> 01:02:29,091
我全都看到了
He saw it all.

434
01:02:31,027 --> 01:02:33,072
我的血包开车碾死了老乔的母种
My own blood bag driving
the rig that killed her.

435
01:02:41,071 --> 01:02:42,082
别这样了
Stop doing that.

436
01:02:46,052 --> 01:02:47,052
停下来
Stop.

437
01:02:57,064 --> 01:03:00,021
大门三次为我敞开 我却失去了所有机会
Three times the gates were open to me.

438
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,080
什么大门
What gates?

439
01:03:02,048 --> 01:03:04,002
英灵殿的大门在等着我
I was awaited in Valhalla.

440
01:03:04,048 --> 01:03:06,000
它在呼唤我的名字
They were calling my name.

441
01:03:06,049 --> 01:03:10,040
我可以跟英灵们同行 与先烈们共餐
I should be walking with the Immortan.
Feasting with the heroes of all time.

442
01:03:14,054 --> 01:03:16,091
我想这不是你的命运
I'd say it was your
manifest destiny not to.

443
01:03:18,073 --> 01:03:21,035
我觉得我是在为更大的荣誉做准备
I thought I was being spared for something great.

444
01:03:21,045 --> 01:03:25,001
我开着追捕车的时候...
I got to... drive a pursuit vehicle.

445
01:03:25,097 --> 01:03:29,009
甚至有一段时间Larry和Barry都停止了侵蚀
For a while even Larry and Barry
stop chewing on my windpipe.

446
01:03:29,028 --> 01:03:30,084
Larry和Barry是谁？
Who're Larry and Barry?

447
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:33,027
我的肿瘤
My mates.

448
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,005
Larry和Barry
Larry and Barry.

449
01:03:37,017 --> 01:03:39,058
但就算他们没有侵蚀我，我也会高烧折磨
If they don't get me, the Night Fevers will.

450
01:04:05,015 --> 01:04:08,098
这把步枪只剩4发子弹了 所以我觉得已经没什么用了
We only got four for big boy here,
so he's all but useless.

451
01:04:09,064 --> 01:04:10,064
不过...
But...

452
01:04:10,087 --> 01:04:14,060
我们的这把小手枪还可以射29次
we can squirt off this little pinky
about 29 times.

453
01:04:17,025 --> 01:04:19,032
Angharad曾经叫它反叛之种
Angharad used to call it Anti-seed.

454
01:04:20,006 --> 01:04:22,050
埋下一颗就一定会死
Plant one and watch the thing die.

455
01:05:57,042 --> 01:06:00,078
我们耗费了3000加仑的汽油...
We are down 30000 units of gasoline...

456
01:06:00,097 --> 01:06:03,009
19罐硝基...
19 canisters of nitro...

457
01:06:03,014 --> 01:06:04,062
12辆摩托车...
12 assault bikes...

458
01:06:04,072 --> 01:06:06,040
7辆追捕车
7 pursuit vehicles.

459
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,089
全都白搭了
My deficit mounts.

460
01:06:07,098 --> 01:06:09,012
然而现在...
And now, sir...

461
01:06:09,049 --> 01:06:12,027
你又让我们陷入了困境！
you, have us stuck in a quagmire!

462
01:06:12,096 --> 01:06:13,096
老乔！
Hey Joe!

463
01:06:14,097 --> 01:06:16,004
老大
Boss!

464
01:06:18,012 --> 01:06:20,018
你的妻子快不行了！
Your girl is breathing her last!

465
01:06:20,091 --> 01:06:22,092
那孩子呢？
What about the child?

466
01:06:32,011 --> 01:06:33,052
你们还走不走？！
Are you coming Brother?!

467
01:06:33,075 --> 01:06:34,085
等下！
Wait!

468
01:06:36,008 --> 01:06:37,073
孩子也没声了
It's gone awful quiet in there.

469
01:06:37,087 --> 01:06:39,013
剖出来！
Take it out!

470
01:06:39,027 --> 01:06:40,053
把它取出来！
Get it Out!!!

471
01:06:43,049 --> 01:06:45,063
快点！我不想等了！
Come on! I've been called to the torture!

472
01:06:46,035 --> 01:06:47,044
耐心点！
Patience!

473
01:06:49,016 --> 01:06:51,055
噢你在这慢慢悲伤吧！
Oh you stay here with your grief daddy!

474
01:06:51,095 --> 01:06:55,015
我要去找她了
I'll fetch 'em for ya. 
小心点！别伤了老乔的宝贝！
Be careful! Protect the assets!!

475
01:06:57,047 --> 01:06:59,095
只需要一颗子弹...
Just one angry shot!...

476
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:02,067
就能要了她的命！
for Furiosa.

477
01:07:02,067 --> 01:07:03,067
冲啊！
Hut!

478
01:07:11,007 --> 01:07:12,047
真可惜啊
Crying shame.

479
01:07:15,097 --> 01:07:16,097
要是再等一个月...
Another month...

480
01:07:17,068 --> 01:07:19,054
可能就是个健康的孩子！
could've been a viable human!

481
01:07:19,096 --> 01:07:21,010
是男孩吗？
Was it a male?

482
01:07:21,061 --> 01:07:22,092
是个一流的继承人
A-One Alpha Prime.

483
01:07:26,029 --> 01:07:27,038
嘿 Rictus！
Hey Rictus!

484
01:07:28,088 --> 01:07:30,032
你失去了一个弟弟！
You lost a baby brother!

485
01:07:33,012 --> 01:07:34,064
相当的完美
Perfect in every way.

486
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:39,010
我有过一个弟弟了！
I had a baby brother!!

487
01:07:39,065 --> 01:07:41,047
我有过一个小弟弟！
I had a little baby brother!!!

488
01:07:41,069 --> 01:07:43,042
他很完美！
And he was perfect!!

489
01:07:43,085 --> 01:07:45,043
相当相当的完美！！
Perfect in every way!!!

490
01:08:16,045 --> 01:08:17,045
来吧
Come on.

491
01:08:26,045 --> 01:08:27,091
老大 你别打到那些娘们了
You wouldn't wanna shoot the wives sir.

492
01:08:28,042 --> 01:08:29,028
我只是看看她们的反应
Just prove it

493
01:08:40,098 --> 01:08:41,098
他想要帮忙！
He wants to help!

494
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,082
谁？
Who?!

495
01:08:43,098 --> 01:08:45,034
那个战争之子！
The War Boy!!

496
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:48,074
他从哪来的？！
Where did he come from?! 
我们不是把他推下车了吗！
I thought we threw him off the rig!!

497
01:08:53,007 --> 01:08:55,003
我把车开到前面的高地去！
There is high ground, just beyond that thing!

498
01:08:55,018 --> 01:08:56,026
他是说那棵树
He means the tree.

499
01:08:56,059 --> 01:08:59,050
是的！那棵树！
Yeah. Tree!

500
01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:00,050
把他交给我吧！
Leave him to me!

501
01:09:00,072 --> 01:09:04,007
你们有人看到光亮吗？ 那是在交火吗？
Say, anyone notice that bright light?
Approaching gunfire?

502
01:09:04,086 --> 01:09:06,093
滚下来
Get out. 
我可以帮忙 我了解这辆车
I can do this. I know this machine.

503
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:08,057
没错 他是个老司机
He does. He's a Revhead.

504
01:09:14,042 --> 01:09:15,042
你只剩两发子弹了！
You got two left!

505
01:09:21,075 --> 01:09:22,082
看住他
On him.

506
01:09:40,052 --> 01:09:41,098
屏住气
Don't breathe.

507
01:09:46,027 --> 01:09:47,083
嘿！嘿！嘿！！
Hey! Hey!! Hey!!!

508
01:09:48,023 --> 01:09:49,044
战争男孩！
War Boy!!

509
01:09:49,077 --> 01:09:52,019
我去用绞盘缠住树！
I'll use the winch! Around the tree thing.

510
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,030
拿着这个
Take this.

511
01:09:54,042 --> 01:09:56,021
我们去引擎那
Let's get the engine plates.

512
01:09:57,070 --> 01:09:58,084
你去开车！
You drive the rig!

513
01:09:58,084 --> 01:10:00,066
拿火炬！
Hold the flare!
我已经拿着了！
I am holding the flare!!

514
01:10:01,042 --> 01:10:03,060
再近一点！
Closer! 
已经在您眼前了！
It's right in front of your eyes!!

515
01:10:16,017 --> 01:10:17,087
冲！冲啊！
Hut! HUTTT!!!!

516
01:10:24,035 --> 01:10:25,035
血包！
Blood Bag!

517
01:10:32,003 --> 01:10:34,016
我是正义的使者！
I am the scales of justice!

518
01:10:34,056 --> 01:10:37,002
掌控生死的指挥家！
Conductor of the choir of death!

519
01:10:41,069 --> 01:10:43,011
开火！！
Sing for the flock!!

520
01:10:46,029 --> 01:10:49,068
开枪！开他妈的枪！
Sing Brother! Sing!! SINGGGG!!!!

521
01:10:50,063 --> 01:10:52,074
难道他们不知道在朝我们开枪吗？！
Don't they know they're shooting at us?!

522
01:11:06,097 --> 01:11:07,099
换弹！
Guns reload!!!

523
01:12:18,041 --> 01:12:20,053
我从没想过我能做这种不平凡的事情！
I never thought I would do
something as shiny as that!

524
01:12:21,013 --> 01:12:22,036
引擎怎么了？
How're the engines?

525
01:12:23,027 --> 01:12:24,070
又热又渴
Very hot and real thirsty.

526
01:12:29,059 --> 01:12:33,081
嘿 你再继续往前开半公里
Hey. You need to take the rig
half a click down the track.

527
01:12:34,078 --> 01:12:37,027
如果引擎冷却你还没回来怎么办？
What if you're not back
by the time the engines are cooled?

528
01:12:39,082 --> 01:12:41,037
那你们就继续前进
Well you keep moving!

529
01:12:51,004 --> 01:12:52,078
你觉得他会怎么做？
What do you suppose he's gonna do?

530
01:12:53,093 --> 01:12:55,042
以牙还牙
Retaliate first.

531
01:12:59,015 --> 01:13:00,022
我们出发！
Let's go!

532
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:20,092
你受伤了吗？
Are you hurt?

533
01:14:22,071 --> 01:14:23,071
你在流血
You're bleeding.

534
01:14:24,068 --> 01:14:26,002
那不是他的血
That's not his blood.

535
01:14:27,085 --> 01:14:28,085
这是什么
What is this?

536
01:14:30,004 --> 01:14:31,012
那是人奶
It's Mother's Milk.

537
01:15:13,094 --> 01:15:14,094
没事的
It's okay.

538
01:15:15,046 --> 01:15:16,046
睡吧
Sleep.

539
01:15:17,032 --> 01:15:18,080
好好休息一下
Get some rest.

540
01:15:29,037 --> 01:15:31,079
你这么知道那有绿洲？
How do you know this place even exists?

541
01:15:34,065 --> 01:15:35,095
我出生在那里
I was born there.

542
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,042
那为什么离开了？
Why'd you leave?

543
01:15:39,091 --> 01:15:40,094
我没有离开
I didn't.

544
01:15:42,048 --> 01:15:44,036
我是被掳走的
I was taken as a child.

545
01:15:46,030 --> 01:15:47,032
被偷走的
Stolen.

546
01:15:53,053 --> 01:15:54,097
这种事你之前做过吗？
You've done this before?

547
01:15:55,081 --> 01:15:57,042
很多次了
Many times.

548
01:15:58,035 --> 01:16:00,016
我能够驾驶这辆车...
Now that I drive a War Rig...

549
01:16:02,013 --> 01:16:04,028
是我前所未有的好机会
this is the best shot I'll ever have.

550
01:16:05,042 --> 01:16:06,048
她们呢？
And them?

551
01:16:08,026 --> 01:16:10,003
她们在寻求希望
They are looking for hope.

552
01:16:11,009 --> 01:16:12,011
那你呢？
What about you?

553
01:16:17,077 --> 01:16:19,021
救赎
Redemption.

554
01:17:02,056 --> 01:17:04,098
嘿 那是什么？
Hey. What's that?

555
01:17:17,055 --> 01:17:20,002
我以前见过那个东西
I remember something like that.

556
01:17:32,008 --> 01:17:33,030
救我！
Help me!

557
01:17:36,045 --> 01:17:37,090
救救我！
HELP ME!!!!

558
01:17:41,082 --> 01:17:42,096
求你了 救救我！
Please, help me!

559
01:17:43,021 --> 01:17:44,030
求你了！
Please!

560
01:17:44,094 --> 01:17:46,029
那是个诱饵
That's bait.

561
01:17:47,081 --> 01:17:49,002
待在车里
Stay in the Rig.

562
01:17:54,045 --> 01:17:57,018
快！求你了 快点！ 他们要回来了！
Hurry! Please, hurry up! They will be back!

563
01:17:58,068 --> 01:18:00,073
我是Vuvalini中的一员
I'm one of the Vuvalini!

564
01:18:02,016 --> 01:18:03,078
有众多的母亲
From the Many Mothers!

565
01:18:05,044 --> 01:18:08,043
我的启蒙母亲叫作 Katie Concannon
My initiate mother was Katie Concannon!

566
01:18:09,082 --> 01:18:12,023
我是Mary Jo Bassa的女儿
I am the daughter of Mary Jo Bassa.

567
01:18:13,082 --> 01:18:16,016
我的家族是襁褓之犬
My clan was Swaddle Dog!

568
01:19:03,059 --> 01:19:04,083
是我
It's me.

569
01:19:12,099 --> 01:19:14,078
看你的那双眼眸
There's something in the eyes.

570
01:19:15,030 --> 01:19:17,011
也许是Jo Bassa'的女儿
Perhaps she is Jo Bassa's child.

571
01:19:22,053 --> 01:19:24,028
这是我们的Furiosa
This is our Furiosa.

572
01:19:26,096 --> 01:19:28,019
已经过去多久了？
How long has it been?

573
01:19:29,089 --> 01:19:31,012
7000个日夜了
Seven thousand days.

574
01:19:31,097 --> 01:19:33,066
还有一些已经忘却的日子
Plus the ones I don't remember.

575
01:19:35,043 --> 01:19:36,043
Furiosa.

576
01:19:37,075 --> 01:19:39,037
你的妈妈怎么了？
What happened to your mother?

577
01:19:40,092 --> 01:19:42,014
她去世了
She died.

578
01:19:43,011 --> 01:19:44,048
在我出生的第三天
On the 3rd day.

579
01:19:51,069 --> 01:19:52,079
你从哪里来的？
From where did you come?

580
01:19:53,036 --> 01:19:57,003
西方 山后的要塞
The West. Citadel. Beyond the mountains.

581
01:20:01,053 --> 01:20:03,035
那两个男的 他们是谁？
The men. Who are they?

582
01:20:03,073 --> 01:20:05,007
他们是可以信赖的人
They're reliable.

583
01:20:05,045 --> 01:20:06,094
多亏了他们我们才能到这里
They helped us get here.

584
01:20:19,009 --> 01:20:21,004
你们哪找的这种衣服？
Where did you find such creatures?

585
01:20:23,081 --> 01:20:24,081
真柔软
So soft.

586
01:20:25,075 --> 01:20:28,001
真是一口好牙！
This one has all her teeth!

587
01:20:36,035 --> 01:20:38,016
我等不急想让他们瞧瞧了
I can't wait for them to see it.

588
01:20:39,010 --> 01:20:40,012
瞧？
See?

589
01:20:41,023 --> 01:20:42,042
瞧什么？
See what?

590
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:44,010
家啊
Home.

591
01:20:48,023 --> 01:20:49,048
那片绿洲
The Green Place.

592
01:20:49,073 --> 01:20:51,087
如果你们是从西方来的...
But if you came from the West...

593
01:20:52,096 --> 01:20:54,048
那你们已经路过了
you passed it.

594
01:20:55,098 --> 01:20:57,022
那片...
The crows.

595
01:20:57,061 --> 01:20:59,093
那片乌鸦横飞的恐怖之地
The creepy place with all the crows.

596
01:21:01,026 --> 01:21:02,064
土地被污染后 我们不得不搬出去
The soil. I We had to get out.

597
01:21:02,078 --> 01:21:04,067
我们没有水
We had no water.
水也是被污染的
And water was filth.

598
01:21:04,081 --> 01:21:06,046
都是酸臭的
It was sour.

599
01:21:06,059 --> 01:21:08,001
然后乌鸦就来了
Then the crows came.

600
01:21:08,026 --> 01:21:09,097
我们什么也种不了
We couldn't grow anything.

601
01:21:10,033 --> 01:21:11,060
那其他人呢？
Where are the others?

602
01:21:11,096 --> 01:21:12,096
什么人？
What others?

603
01:21:13,001 --> 01:21:14,004
其他的母亲呢？
The Many Mothers.

604
01:21:14,056 --> 01:21:17,080
我们是唯一剩下来的
We're the only ones left.

605
01:22:16,038 --> 01:22:17,054
看
Look.

606
01:22:20,082 --> 01:22:22,089
那就是你们所谓的人造卫星
That's what you'd call a satellite.

607
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:25,079
Miss Giddy曾经跟我们说过
Miss Giddy told us about those.

608
01:22:26,044 --> 01:22:29,028
它最初是给整个地球发收信号的
They used to bounce messages
across the Earth.

609
01:22:30,007 --> 01:22:34,024
电视节目 曾经人人都爱看的电视节目
Shows. Everyone in the old world
had a show.

610
01:22:36,067 --> 01:22:38,096
你觉得在那里还会有人吗？
Do you think there's still
somebody out there?

611
01:22:40,005 --> 01:22:41,052
在那发送信号？
Sending shows?

612
01:22:42,010 --> 01:22:44,020
谁知道呢
Who knows?

613
01:22:44,065 --> 01:22:46,043
都是一片死寂
Those are the Plains of Silence.

614
01:22:49,049 --> 01:22:53,077
好好呆在里面吧小乔 我好像已经失去了新奇感
Stay right where you are little Joey.
Kinda lost it's novelty out here.

615
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,049
你怀孕了？
You having a baby?

616
01:22:56,055 --> 01:22:57,094
是啊
Warlord Junior.

617
01:22:58,044 --> 01:22:59,048
肯定是个丑陋的小暴君
Gonna be so ugly.

618
01:23:00,025 --> 01:23:01,067
说不定是个女孩呢
It could be a girl.

619
01:23:03,046 --> 01:23:05,005
你用那个杀过很多人吧
You killed people with that do ya?

620
01:23:05,058 --> 01:23:07,043
我杀死了我在这里遇到的所有人
Killed everyone I met out here.

621
01:23:07,078 --> 01:23:10,004
爆头的 穿颈的 应有尽有
Headshots. All. Snap! Right in the medulla.

622
01:23:10,027 --> 01:23:12,023
我以为你还会女人一点
I thought you girls were above all that.

623
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:17,088
过来
Come here.

624
01:23:25,088 --> 01:23:26,088
挑个看看
Take a peek in.

625
01:23:27,090 --> 01:23:28,094
种子！
Seeds!

626
01:23:30,002 --> 01:23:31,047
这是从家乡带来的家产
These are from home.

627
01:23:31,053 --> 01:23:33,082
真正的 有机种子！
Heirlooms. The real thing!

628
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:36,026
我一直在试着播种
I plant one every chance I get.

629
01:23:36,079 --> 01:23:37,079
在哪？
Where?

630
01:23:37,087 --> 01:23:40,073
到现在 没有存活的 土地都酸化了
So far nothings took. Earth's too sour.

631
01:23:41,032 --> 01:23:42,094
这有很多种类
Ohh so many different kinds.

632
01:23:43,032 --> 01:23:45,009
树木 花卉 水果
Trees, flowers, fruit.

633
01:23:46,034 --> 01:23:48,031
在过去 人人都有这些东西
Back then everyone had their fill!

634
01:23:48,098 --> 01:23:51,032
在过去 我们不需要杀死任何人
Back then, there was no need to snap anybody!

635
01:24:07,023 --> 01:24:08,075
我能和你谈谈吗？
Can I talk to you?

636
01:24:28,011 --> 01:24:29,077
我已经和其他人谈过了
I've talked with the others.

637
01:24:36,076 --> 01:24:39,088
现在是跨越沙漠的最好机会
We're never going to have a better chance
to make it across the salt.

638
01:24:42,013 --> 01:24:46,023
如果我们把卡车留在这 骑上摩托满载出发...
If we leave the rig here, and load the
motorcycles up with as much as we can...

639
01:24:46,037 --> 01:24:48,068
我们至少能够开个160天
we can be able to ride for 160 days.

640
01:24:51,073 --> 01:24:53,050
我们给你留了一辆
One of those bikes is yours.

641
01:24:54,073 --> 01:24:55,094
加满了油
Fully loaded.

642
01:24:58,071 --> 01:25:01,022
非常欢迎你加入我们
You're more than welcome to come with us.

643
01:25:05,036 --> 01:25:07,005
不..不 我会自己走的
N..No, I make my own way.

644
01:25:13,091 --> 01:25:15,049
你知道吗 抱着希望本身就是个错误
You know, hope is a mistake.

645
01:25:22,077 --> 01:25:25,046
如果你没法改变现状...
If you can't fix what's broken, you'll...

646
01:25:28,011 --> 01:25:29,058
你就只能被现实打败
You'll go insane.

647
01:25:46,008 --> 01:25:47,039
你在哪 Max？
Where are you, Max?

648
01:25:49,065 --> 01:25:50,070
你在哪？
Where are you?

649
01:25:52,048 --> 01:25:54,042
救救我们  你答应过会救我们的
Help us. You promised to help us.

650
01:26:04,095 --> 01:26:07,005
爸爸快过来！我们走！
Come on Pa! Let's go!

651
01:26:39,026 --> 01:26:40,026
听好了
Alright.

652
01:26:41,038 --> 01:26:43,056
这里 才是你的家
THIS, is your way home.

653
01:26:47,016 --> 01:26:48,024
我们要回去？
We go back?

654
01:26:50,058 --> 01:26:52,020
回去？  没错  
Back?   Yeah.

655
01:26:52,059 --> 01:26:54,022
我以为你已经恢复正常了
I thought you weren't insane anymore.

656
01:26:54,031 --> 01:26:55,066
他怎么说的？
What are they saying?

657
01:26:55,084 --> 01:26:58,009
他想回到我们离开的地方
He wants to go back from where they came.

658
01:26:58,036 --> 01:26:59,036
要塞
The Citadel.

659
01:27:00,041 --> 01:27:01,092
要塞里面有什么？
What's there to find at the Citadel??

660
01:27:02,041 --> 01:27:03,055
绿洲
Green.

661
01:27:04,008 --> 01:27:05,040
还有水！
And water!

662
01:27:06,082 --> 01:27:10,044
那里有取之不尽的水和粮食
There is a ridiculous amounts of
clear water. And a lot of crops.

663
01:27:10,047 --> 01:27:12,065
那里什么都有 只要你不恐高
It's got everything you need.
As long as you're not afraid of heights.

664
01:27:13,022 --> 01:27:14,053
那些水是从哪来的？
Where does the water come from?

665
01:27:14,057 --> 01:27:16,025
老乔从深层的地下打出来的
He pumps it out from deep under the earth.

666
01:27:16,035 --> 01:27:18,057
他控制了他所谓的“纯净之水” 
Calls it ‘Aqua Cola',
and claims it all for himself.

667
01:27:18,096 --> 01:27:21,015
并因此来统治一切
And because he owns it,
he owns all of us.

668
01:27:21,025 --> 01:27:22,044
我已经开始讨厌他了
I don't like him already.

669
01:27:22,059 --> 01:27:24,098
穿过山脉得花我们两周的时间
It'll take two weeks just to
scale a wall of mountains.

670
01:27:25,036 --> 01:27:26,036
不需要
No.

671
01:27:26,042 --> 01:27:28,094
我建议直接原路返回
I suggest we go back the same way we came.

672
01:27:30,082 --> 01:27:32,015
穿过峡谷
Through the canyon.

673
01:27:33,057 --> 01:27:37,027
那里应该已经被打通了不是么？ 他的那些人就是从那边通过的
It's open. We know that. Right?
He brought all his war parties through!

674
01:27:37,081 --> 01:27:41,023
所以我们得用武装卡车穿过他们之中
So, we take the War Rig and we charge
it right through the middle of 'em.

675
01:27:41,024 --> 01:27:43,087
可以在路上倒上汽油...
We can decouple the tank at the pass...

676
01:27:44,026 --> 01:27:45,072
断了他们的后路
shut it off behind us.

677
01:27:46,001 --> 01:27:47,001
Ka-Boom!!

678
01:27:50,006 --> 01:27:52,047
那到底我们要怎样拿下要塞呢？
And how exactly do we take the Citadel?

679
01:27:53,013 --> 01:27:54,079
假设那时我们还活着
Assuming we're still alive by then?

680
01:27:55,019 --> 01:27:57,070
如果我们能够阻断道路，那就会变得很容易
If we can block the pass, it'll be easy.

681
01:27:58,001 --> 01:28:01,051
剩下的就只是些老弱病残的了
All that's left are his War Pups,
and War Boys too sick to fight.

682
01:28:02,046 --> 01:28:04,009
我们可以跟着Nux
And we'll be with Nux.

683
01:28:04,082 --> 01:28:05,094
他是个战争之子
He's a War Boy.

684
01:28:05,099 --> 01:28:07,003
押我们回去也是合情合理
He'll be bringing us home.

685
01:28:07,027 --> 01:28:09,011
他的职责就是带回被偷走的东西
Bringing back what's
stolen, as he's meant to.

686
01:28:12,049 --> 01:28:13,049
没错
Yeah.

687
01:28:14,035 --> 01:28:15,099
听起来挺有希望的
Feels like hope.

688
01:28:17,036 --> 01:28:20,025
我喜欢这个计划 我们可以重新开始！
I like this plan. We can start again!

689
01:28:21,006 --> 01:28:22,057
就像过去的那些日子！
Just like the old days!

690
01:28:24,038 --> 01:28:25,046
听着
Look.

691
01:28:26,017 --> 01:28:28,002
这将会是艰难的一天
It will be a hard day.

692
01:28:28,051 --> 01:28:31,038
但我敢保证 你再往前走个160天...
But I guarantee you 160 days riding that way...

693
01:28:33,088 --> 01:28:35,073
见到的还是沙子
there's nothing but.

694
01:28:38,033 --> 01:28:41,004
如果我们原路杀回去 至少我们可以...
At least that way, y'know
we might be able to...

695
01:28:42,067 --> 01:28:44,081
一起...
together...

696
01:28:45,055 --> 01:28:47,051
得到某种所谓的救赎
come across some kind of redemption.

697
01:29:18,027 --> 01:29:19,035
武装车！
War Rig!

698
01:29:20,006 --> 01:29:21,066
那是她的武装卡车！
It's the War Rig!

699
01:29:31,090 --> 01:29:32,090
是他们没错
That's them.

700
01:29:33,088 --> 01:29:35,012
为什么他们回来了？
Why're they going back?

701
01:29:35,072 --> 01:29:37,021
他们是想投降吗？
Do they wish to surrender?

702
01:29:38,028 --> 01:29:39,052
他们开向了峡谷
They're heading for the canyon.

703
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:44,021
他们是要回去！ 回大本营！
They're going back, to the Citadel!!!

704
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:46,021
他们知道那里是毫无防备的！
They know it's undefended!!

705
01:29:46,024 --> 01:29:47,046
混蛋！
Bollocks!

706
01:30:23,065 --> 01:30:24,044
你在做什么？         祈祷
What are you doing?    Praying.

707
01:30:25,057 --> 01:30:26,067
向谁祈祷？
To whom?

708
01:30:26,075 --> 01:30:28,022
随便哪个神仙
Anyone that's listening.

709
01:30:52,042 --> 01:30:53,083
做好准备姐妹们！
Here we go girls!

710
01:30:56,051 --> 01:30:57,053
那是我的车！
That's mine!!

711
01:31:01,093 --> 01:31:04,028
他们想抢在我们前面！ 破坏我们的轮胎
They'll try to get in front of us!
