1
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:10,770
You're about to see a story of bold knights
and beautiful maidens.

2
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:14,974
A story of love and hatred and prejudice.

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,943
Though our story is old...

4
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:24,156
...the love, the hatred
and the prejudice are ever new.

5
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:37,890
- Holy God of Abraham, spare me.
- Silence if you value your life.

6
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:41,360
- Holy Father, I beg you.
- Silence.

7
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:45,193
Follow me.

8
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:56,746
This way.

9
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,432
You see? They've been lying in wait for you.

10
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:28,842
Where is he? Where is this Jew?

11
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,973
- Well?
- He's gone, sire.

12
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,076
- Gone?
- Disappeared.

13
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:37,323
Imbecile. You let him get away.

14
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,150
They're Normans.

15
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,593
Saxons or Normans,
what does it matter to me?

16
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:47,461
Do I rejoice because
the brave Normans cross the Channel.

17
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,799
...and defeat the brave Saxons?
What's the difference?

18
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,830
They both treat us like dogs.
You call them brave knights?

19
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:59,810
- I call them thieves.
- A rich merchant, I fear, is fair game.

20
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,945
No matter. You saved my life
and I am forever in your debt.

21
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,557
If you keep to this road any longer, sir,
no one can help you.

22
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,634
I shall be lost otherwise.

23
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,370
I know this country. Where are you bound?

24
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:28,770
- To Ashby. The great tournament.
- Why, then we could travel together.

25
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:35,313
May I ask who you are
that I may thank for my deliverance?

26
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,843
Merely a poor pilgrim returning
from the Holy Land.

27
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:46,050
Come, to waste anymore time here
would be dangerous.

28
00:03:56,869 --> 00:04:00,305
There. There lies Ashby.

29
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:08,303
The blessings of Jacob be upon you,
pilgrim. How am I going to repay you?

30
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:10,212
- I want nothing.
- You shall have a horse.

31
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,648
...and armor for the tournament.

32
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:18,253
- But how did you know that I...
- I've seen it at once.

33
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:23,762
Beneath your robe, the chain mail
of a knight and the golden spurs.

34
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:25,353
You shall have everything you need.

35
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,758
Then I must warn you, sir, that both horse
and armor may be lost in the jousting.

36
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:31,864
That's impossible.

37
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,874
Your lance, good youth, will be
as powerful as the rod of Moses.

38
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,485
My little bucklehead.

39
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:19,471
- Norman dogs.
- Careful, master.

40
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:22,475
They say Prince John has
ten thousand ears.

41
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:26,279
Well, let him hear me then.
I'll say it to his face.

42
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,174
Who is that?

43
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,304
That's Cedric of Rotherwood, a Saxon lord.

44
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:58,476
- I meant the lady.
- Oh, that's his ward, the Lady Rowena...

45
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,384
...from the royal line of Alfred the Great.

46
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:06,154
- She is beautiful.
- If a Saxon can be called beautiful.

47
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:20,435
The challengers, Reginald Front-de-Boeuf!

48
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,579
Maurice de Bracy!

49
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:40,954
Brian Guilbert!

50
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:46,084
Listen to the crowd.
Prince John is well accepted here today.

51
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,319
He would do well to take over
the throne now

52
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:51,123
...before King Richard gets back
from the Holy Land.

53
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,290
Richard dies the moment he returns.

54
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,145
- Fitzurse.
- Yes, Your Grace?

55
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:10,681
Are we ready to begin?

56
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:15,015
There is still the choosing of a queen
for the tournament, sire.

57
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:20,755
If it would please Your Highness,
my daughter, perhaps?

58
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,919
No, it might appear unseemly
to announce your daughter.

59
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,929
...before the tournament has yet begun.

60
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:28,626
Let the gallant knight who conquers
the field here today make the choice.

61
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:38,701
These three noble challengers
will undertake all comers.

62
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:44,207
Each challenger may be selected
by touching his shield with a lance.

63
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,978
If the shield is touched
with the reverse end of the lance...

64
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,957
...then sharp points will not be used.

65
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:57,395
But if the sharp tip of the lance
touches the shield...

66
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:03,227
...then the combat is understood to be
with sharp weapons.

67
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:09,333
If any knight should break the lance
of all three challengers here before me...

68
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:15,478
...then Prince John will declare that knight
the victor in this day's combat.

69
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:18,646
The Prince wants the victor
to choose the Queen.

70
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,649
Prince John has declared.

71
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:27,216
...the victor will have the honor of choosing
our Queen of Love and Beauty.

72
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:36,691
Normans. All three, Normans.

73
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,529
Is there a Saxon to meet them?

74
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:43,667
Tomorrow. I fight tomorrow.

75
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,554
Are you looking for someone?

76
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,614
Your Highness,
no sharp points will be used.

77
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:32,251
How disappointing.

78
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,457
Go on.

79
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,924
Is there no one here? No one to stop them?

80
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,000
Tomorrow.

81
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,872
- Who is he?
- Look again, master.

82
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:33,369
- Perhaps you should ask, who was he?
- A Saxon?

83
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:37,977
- Without question.
- Have we no better than this?

84
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:42,018
We have, my lord. His name is Ivanhoe.

85
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,578
- Your son, master.
- I have no son.

86
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,591
You may have disowned him,
but he's still your flesh and blood.

87
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:49,661
...and worthy of his Saxon name.

88
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:53,095
He is worthy of scorn and nothing else.

89
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:59,604
What a disgrace. What a pity.
My son ran off and left the city.

90
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:30,267
Next! Who is next?

91
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:39,975
Your Grace, there are none left now
who will meet the challengers.

92
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:49,614
Is it possible? Will they let
these Norman invaders take the day?

93
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,420
The very honor of England is at stake.
Surely, you...

94
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:02,934
How annoying that we should finish
so early. So quickly. And yet...

95
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:08,099
And yet how comforting to know
that the three strongest knights on this field.

96
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:11,574
...are loyal only to you, Your Majesty.

97
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:48,810
It's him. It's him. The pilgrim.

98
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:15,036
Desdichado.
The Disinherited Knight. Welcome.

99
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:21,146
You have your choice.
However, the outcome will remain the same.

100
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:41,229
I am disappointed.
Would that I trade places with you, Front.

101
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,393
Never. This one is mine.

102
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,906
A Saxon. I'll wager he's a Saxon.

103
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:47,788
May I hope that you will now give me
the opportunity?

104
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:03,407
What a shame, Brian.
Now you'll never get your chance.

105
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,964
Who is he? Find out who he is.

106
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:47,415
Have you confessed yourself this morning
that you peril your life so frankly?

107
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,459
The sharp end. They will use the points.

108
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:58,261
Prepare yourself then.
Look your last upon the sun.

109
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:32,060
Hold! You are allowed the lance only.
You are not allowed the sword.

110
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,564
You, Disinherited Knight.

111
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:39,927
We proclaim you the champion
of this day's tournament.

112
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:50,045
We shall meet again tomorrow
when there are none to part us.

113
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:05,956
Brave knight, we commend your valor.

114
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:10,963
And we award you this valiant steed
to match your courage.

115
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,262
You call yourself the Disinherited One?

116
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,731
By what other name shall we know you?

117
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:55,739
As a stranger in our land, you may require
assistance in your choice of a queen.

118
00:21:56,248 --> 00:22:02,949
Let us say to you that the fair Alicia is
considered the first in beauty as in place.

119
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:09,022
Would you present your lance?

120
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,631
You may now indicate your choice.

121
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:55,468
Largesse.

122
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,168
Largesse to the gallant knight.

123
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:01,508
Long live the Queen of Love and Beauty.

124
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,209
Long live the Queen of Love and Beauty.

125
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:10,486
Long live the Queen of Love and Beauty.

126
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:14,814
Long live the Queen of Love and Beauty.

127
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:23,234
You can't just waste your whole life
in bitterness, Father.

128
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:26,771
Bitterness? You speak of bitterness?
What would you have me be?

129
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,033
Our lord and master, Prince John...

130
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:32,599
...demands twice the contribution
I gave him last month.

131
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:36,539
Contribution. It's a ransom.

132
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:40,941
But surely King Richard will return
to England and resume his throne.

133
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:44,021
What difference does that make to us,
Richard or John?

134
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:49,857
In this wicked country
we shall always be persecuted.

135
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:53,628
No. All Christians are not the same.

136
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,458
Think of the gallant knight
who fought today.

137
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,469
Now there was a brave and noble youth.

138
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:03,132
I'll wager that pilgrim was Jewish.

139
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:06,366
Yes, Beaslin?

140
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:10,544
There's a stranger at the door, sire.
He wishes to speak to you.

141
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,048
Does he look dangerous?

142
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,746
I don't believe so.
He wears the garments of a pilgrim.

143
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,314
Veil yourself.

144
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:32,934
My friend.

145
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:37,168
Sir, forgive my intrusion.
I'm here to pay my debt to you.

146
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:40,434
Debt? What debt? I owe you my life.

147
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:41,945
Not at all.

148
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,915
My daughter, Rebecca.

149
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:47,911
I am honored.

150
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:52,150
You owe me nothing. You've paid me back
in full today at the tournament.

151
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,748
May I offer you a goblet of wine?

152
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:59,090
Nevertheless, I have brought your horse
and I have here the price of the armor.

153
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,530
Keep them. They're yours.

154
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:04,126
I feel I must at least pay you something to...

155
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:08,969
My father owes you a far deeper kindness
than any steeds or arms could pay.

156
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:14,369
Please, let us look upon it
as our debt to you for his life.

157
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,045
If that is your wish.

158
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:22,851
Your wine?

159
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:27,822
Forgive me, please. I must prepare myself
for tomorrow's encounter.

160
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,818
Sir, you've been far too generous.

161
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:34,461
I am honored to have met you.

162
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,199
Thank you. I bid you good night.

163
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:15,601
You frightened me.

164
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:18,641
Wait, I will leave and come back again.

165
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,647
There. Are you frightened now?

166
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:28,884
Tell me. Tell me at once.
Who was the mysterious knight?

167
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:30,978
- Who was he?
- Who?

168
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:33,991
Wamba, please, don't play games with me.

169
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,720
What did he say?

170
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:38,258
His voice could not be heard.

171
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,829
His face, his eyes, his nose,
his mouth, could not be seen.

172
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,993
- Why?
- He wasn't there.

173
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:47,561
- Oh, Wamba.
- Gone. Into the night.

174
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:52,403
The good knight gone into the good night.

175
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:57,339
I think it best.

176
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:58,541
Best?

177
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:02,053
Would not Ivanhoe, if he were here...

178
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:06,453
would not Ivanhoe be jealous
of a brave new champion?

179
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,891
He would have no reason.
I am faithful to Ivanhoe.

180
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:14,895
What if Cedric marries you
to the noble hog, Athelstane?

181
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,730
- Never.
- He will insist.

182
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,032
And I will refuse.

183
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,040
Hold!

184
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:35,647
Wamba!

185
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,652
Well?

186
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:44,789
What did she say?

187
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:47,294
Did you talk to her?

188
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:51,126
She hasn't forgotten me?
Well, tell me she hasn't forgotten me.

189
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,329
The lady is fair. She would have a prayer.

190
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:56,930
- For me?
- For the brave knight who won the day.

191
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:00,167
Are they the same? What is your name?

192
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:02,576
Begone, you knave. Begone.

193
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:37,505
The Queen of Love and Beauty
shall be guided to her throne.

194
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:41,051
...by our royal liege, Prince John.

195
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:11,505
- Where is Athelstane?
- Master, that is a question.

196
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:15,684
- Is he getting ready for the combat?
- He is a guest of the noble Lord Gurtog.

197
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:20,020
When I saw them last they were eating
venison, an enormous beast.

198
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:28,728
Be it known, it is forbidden
to thrust with a sword.

199
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,198
You may strike only.

200
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:35,998
A mace or battle ax
may be used at pleasure...

201
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:39,271
...but the dagger is forbidden.

202
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:44,245
Any knight unhorsed may renew
the combat on foot.

203
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:49,050
Any knight who breaks
the rules of this tournament.

204
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,113
will be subjected to public ridicule
and stripped of his arms!

205
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:58,525
Glory to the brave!

206
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:03,530
Very well. Let them begin.

207
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:26,505
Beware!

208
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:43,390
You may stop the combat at any moment.

209
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:46,629
Stop it? By the light of heaven, I will not.

210
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:51,070
He gained his prize yesterday.
Let the others now have their turn.

211
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:43,755
Yield.

212
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,388
Hold. Stop the conflict.

213
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:29,168
Honor to the brave!

214
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,940
Glory to the brave!

215
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,745
Honor to the brave!

216
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,815
Glory to the brave!

217
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:39,644
Honor to the brave!

218
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:41,680
Glory to the brave!

219
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:44,544
Honor to the brave!

220
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:56,425
His head must be bare to accept the chaplet.

221
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,237
Ivanhoe!

222
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,248
The chaplet, my lady.

223
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:17,277
I bestow upon you, Sir Knight...

224
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:22,423
...this chaplet as a gift of honor
for this day's victory.

225
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:36,363
And upon these fearful wounds no worthier
wreath of chivalry could ever be placed.

226
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,309
Ivanhoe!

227
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:48,449
Help him.

228
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:54,288
Help him.

229
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:01,631
Your own son. Will you do nothing?

230
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:05,161
My son has left my house.
He has deserted my country.

231
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:08,831
He has forsaken the Saxon cause.
He is no son of mine.

232
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,408
We must help him quickly, Father.

233
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:17,037
- How?
- Take him to our house.

234
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:21,048
But he is a Christian. By our laws,
we can't deal with him except in commerce.

235
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:24,053
He is gravely wounded and, by our hearts,
we cannot refuse him.

236
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:26,146
Think. If he should die in our care...

237
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:28,249
He will not die unless we abandon him.

238
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:31,089
And, if so, we must then
answer for his blood to God.

239
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:33,823
Quickly. His enemies are all about.

240
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:40,431
Wilfred of Ivanhoe.
There is more to this than one day's battle.

241
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:45,899
If Ivanhoe has returned from the Holy Land,
can King Richard be far behind?

242
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:50,174
Well, let him come. We'll crown his brother
before Richard can gather his forces.

243
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:53,217
The devil take Richard and welcome to him.

244
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:58,086
I, Brian Guilbert, make you
this solemn promise.

245
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:02,626
I shall meet this Wilfred of Ivanhoe
in mortal combat.

246
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:05,753
...and send him to eternity.

247
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:24,275
Get back there. Get back. Get back.

248
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:33,318
- Who is it? Who is it that bears him away?
- Someone far kinder than we, Your Grace.

249
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:39,921
Onward.

250
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:49,803
My lady.

251
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:22,197
You.

252
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,602
My father and I...

253
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:29,337
we brought you here to care
for your wounds.

254
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:34,383
We have special herbs, ways of curing
wounds, although we never inflict them.

255
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:38,780
Herbs?

256
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:42,451
Secret preparations handed down to us
since the days of Solomon.

257
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:47,123
You should be able to bear armor
again within eight days.

258
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:50,827
You may rest at our home in York
until your health is restored.

259
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:52,960
We leave in the morning.

260
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:57,304
Is there not someone else here in Ashby.

261
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:02,904
- who could look after me until I...
- None stepped forward today.

262
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:10,320
My dear, noble maiden, I...

263
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:12,356
No. I am not a noble.

264
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:15,515
I am but a poor Jewess.

265
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:18,592
Is it our race, then?

266
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:22,158
Is that why you do not wish
to travel with us?

267
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:29,664
I have no wish to inconvenience you.

268
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:35,269
I accept your service gratefully.

269
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:40,012
Rest now. I'll leave you.

270
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:16,777
- Your Majesty.
- Rise.

271
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:21,322
- Did you find him?
- At the house of Isaac, the Jew of York.

272
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:23,825
They plan to take him to York
in the early morning.

273
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:27,728
Oh, that was a stroke of good luck.

274
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:32,258
I shall meet with Wilby, Forbes,
and Witherstone at York within the week.

275
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:35,133
All my forces will be gathered there
to challenge my brother.

276
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:38,504
- You're traveling alone?
- I must for the moment.

277
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:41,006
You may retire now. Oh, and, Phillippe...

278
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:43,672
- Your Majesty?
- A good night's work.

279
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:46,273
Thank you, Your Majesty.

280
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:44,001
Well. Where is she?
Where is our queen of the tournament?

281
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:47,537
- She...
- Yes? She is your ward, is she not?

282
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,476
Where is the Lady Rowena?

283
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:52,141
She is exhausted by today's events.

284
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:55,511
She begs leave to decline
your courteous invitation.

285
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:59,753
We are not accustomed to such
a refusal from our appointed queens.

286
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,825
It is traditional that they attend.

287
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:04,884
Your customs are not our customs.

288
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:11,032
Well. Perhaps you'll not object
if we drink a beaker.

289
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:13,365
...to the champion of this passage of arms.

290
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:16,406
To your son, Wilfred of Ivanhoe.

291
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:17,531
I cannot drink.

292
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:20,076
- To your own son?
- He deserted us.

293
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:23,010
He left his house, his country,
to fight in foreign lands.

294
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,548
with your brother, King Richard.

295
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:30,048
Then let us hope my brother holds him
in more esteem than you.

296
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,714
I cannot forgive him. I will not forgive him.

297
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:37,124
A willful youth who refuses
the commands and customs of his fathers.

298
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:43,061
I fill my cup to Cedric, himself.

299
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:51,739
This ward of yours, the Lady Rowena.

300
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:53,276
Yes.

301
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:55,971
A rose of loveliness.

302
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,049
And, I trust, a jewel of wealth?

303
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:01,243
A Saxon of large possessions.

304
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:05,812
It is my intention that she marry
this gallant and noble knight, Athelstane...

305
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:08,483
...the last of the royal line of Saxons.

306
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,820
But then she is a minor, is she not?

307
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:17,560
And she is therefore
at our disposal in marriage.

308
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:18,659
Indeed.

309
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:21,602
What do you think, De Bracy?
I am told you are attracted to the lady?

310
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:23,799
Would you find it pleasing
to take her as your bride?

311
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:26,638
If her lands are to my liking.

312
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:30,908
I will hold myself bound
to Your Highness' wishes.

313
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:35,611
The day my ward marries a Norman will be
that Norman's last day on earth.

314
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:41,181
Hold. Sit down. Both of you.

315
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:45,854
We have invited these honored guests
here this evening.

316
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:49,763
...and they shall remain honored guests.

317
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:52,267
We have offered a toast
to Cedric of Rotherwood.

318
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:56,636
...and now, we pray you,
name us some Norman in return.

319
00:42:56,707 --> 00:43:01,667
It is a hard task, for the conquered,
to sing the praises of his conqueror.

320
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:07,684
Yet I will name a Norman,
even though he led my only son astray.

321
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:11,380
He is still the best of your unfortunate race.

322
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:18,651
I drink this goblet to the health
of King Richard, the Lion-Hearted.

323
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:21,630
Long live King Richard.

324
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:25,601
And now I hope you will excuse us.
We have remained here long enough.

325
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:29,196
Up, noble Athelstane.

326
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,034
We bid you good night.

327
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:51,386
I'm afraid, Your Majesty, that
the Saxon dogs have retreated in triumph.

328
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:53,326
It isn't possible, is it?

329
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:55,888
Could Richard be back in England again?

330
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,490
What does it matter?

331
00:43:57,568 --> 00:43:59,968
You have the services here
of Maurice de Bracy, Front-de-Boeuf...

332
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:01,561
...and my own humble sword.

333
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:05,574
Enough for an army.

334
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:08,236
Here is my toast and solemn pledge.

335
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:12,372
To Prince John, our next King of England.

336
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:16,078
Prince John!

337
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:21,681
Prince John! Prince John!
Prince John! Prince John!

338
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:26,423
Prince John! Prince John!
Prince John! Prince John!

339
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,064
Where is she now?
Where is the Lady Rowena?

340
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,665
- Weeping.
- Weeping?

341
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:47,040
- Come. We must leave at once.
- Would you go without your son?

342
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:48,607
Lvanhoe has chosen to go his own way.

343
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:49,845
- So be it.
- He chose...

344
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,582
He's better fitted now to do
the juggling tricks of the Normans.

345
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,681
...than uphold the honor
of his English ancestry.

346
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:57,124
Who was it that defeated the Normans
at the tournament?

347
00:44:57,227 --> 00:45:01,459
Silence. Not another word.
We leave at once.

348
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:18,941
- Your Highness.
- Yes.

349
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:22,610
This arrived this morning from France.

350
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:36,793
- No!
- What is it?

351
00:45:39,169 --> 00:45:44,573
- "The devil is unchained. Take heed. "
- Richard.

352
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:47,667
He's escaped from France.
He's back in England.

353
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:50,838
We mustn't lose a moment, Your Highness.

354
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:52,916
Draw your troops together at York...

355
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:55,747
...and meet whatever force he has head on.

356
00:45:57,654 --> 00:45:59,246
Your Highness.

357
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:02,284
At once.

358
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,633
My friends.

359
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:22,134
- My friends, we ride for York.
- York?

360
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:25,204
- We join Prince John within the fortnight.
- For what purpose?

361
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:29,547
For the purpose of facing King Richard.

362
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:31,621
At last.

363
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:34,350
York is only a three-day journey.
We have plenty of time.

364
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:35,550
Of course.

365
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:38,184
You shall be my guests
at Torquilstone on the way.

366
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:42,629
Tankards and venison enough to fill
even your fat bellies.

367
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:44,360
What do you say?

368
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:53,528
Here. What are you doing?
Why did you stop?

369
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:54,866
Bandits.

370
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:57,031
Bandits? There are no bandits.

371
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:59,769
Yeah, in the woods maybe. We're leaving.

372
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:02,607
You can't do that. You can't leave us here.

373
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,273
No? We're going.

374
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:10,410
No, stop. You can't take those horses.
Those are my property. Thieves!

375
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,654
Thieves!

376
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:34,800
Here. Drink this.

377
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:42,984
There. Rest now. Rest.

378
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,486
They were hired to take us to York.

379
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:55,463
They've got my money.
Why should they care?

380
00:48:55,532 --> 00:49:00,265
We are deserted.
Oh, God of Abraham, what have I done?

381
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:04,967
- Why must they smite us so?
- Father, look.

382
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:07,772
May God make them merciful.

383
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:23,185
Hold.

384
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:27,320
I greet you warmly, sir.
Trusting you're in good health.

385
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:30,195
Who are you? Speak plainly, infidel.

386
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,234
I'm Isaac of York.

387
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:38,673
I hired a guard of men to escort us to York,
but they've deserted us as you can see.

388
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:39,868
Why?

389
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:46,212
They say there are bandits in the forest.
But, rumor, that's all.

390
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:49,752
I beg you to let us travel
under your protection.

391
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:51,718
Dogs of infidels. Out of the way.

392
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,154
Sir, may I speak, please?

393
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:57,990
We have someone here,
an old person who is gravely ill.

394
00:49:58,061 --> 00:50:01,087
I beg you to let this sick person
be transported with care.

395
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:03,166
...under your protection.

396
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:05,064
It is no concern of ours.

397
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,863
Wait.

398
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:09,906
If this poor person is truly in peril of life...

399
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:13,568
...and if these two kind and earnest people
cannot defend themselves...

400
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:18,444
well, then we must in all charity
give them help.

401
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:21,449
So be it. They may travel in the rear.

402
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,114
What is it? What's the alarm?

403
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,741
No alarm, sir.
All is ready for you at the castle.

404
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:59,448
We only wish to inform you there is
a party of Saxons in the forest there below.

405
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:00,580
Do you know them?

406
00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:04,650
Cedric of Rotherwood, the Lady Rowena
and the noble knight, Athelstane.

407
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:06,126
How large is the party?

408
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:09,926
Ten or eleven. The servants are not armed.

409
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,937
My good friend, De Bracy.
I wager that the hour has struck.

410
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:19,408
- What?
- It is time for us to deliver your wife.

411
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:23,173
Your wife, De Bracy, is awaiting you.

412
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:35,152
- What was that?
- What? I hear nothing.

413
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:05,052
Forgive the intrusion, my lady.
I am pleased to announce...

414
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:07,817
...that you are now the guest
of my good friend, Front-de-Boeuf.

415
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:14,126
I would sooner, sir, go with bandits.
But, indeed, that is what you are.

416
00:52:14,197 --> 00:52:18,531
De Bracy? Are you certain
that you want to marry this sharp tongue?

417
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:31,811
Well, what have we here?

418
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:35,716
I think, perhaps, that we have caught
more than one bird on this occasion.

419
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,184
An infidel.

420
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:39,654
And beautiful beyond belief.

421
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:41,588
We can do you no harm, sir.

422
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:44,819
We have an old woman here
who needs our care.

423
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:47,193
She shall have it, I promise you.

424
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:34,009
Dogs. Norman dogs.

425
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:36,841
Barbarians. But surely they will feed us?

426
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:01,864
Stop.

427
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,684
What is it?
What affliction does this old hag bear?

428
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,947
I would not go close enough to find out.

429
00:54:56,192 --> 00:54:58,752
Set her down. Set her down, please.

430
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:04,857
Well? You may leave.

431
00:55:17,614 --> 00:55:21,641
There. It's all right.

432
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:24,152
Easy. Rest easy, Ivanhoe.

433
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:27,212
Don't be alarmed. Don't shout, I beg you.

434
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:30,725
Are we... Are we in York?

435
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,886
We are prisoners.

436
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:36,357
Get your hands off me. Leave me alone.

437
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:57,344
Lost again. Lost again. What can I do?

438
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:00,821
Taken my master, left the fool.

439
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,095
- Bandit or knave?
- I am neither, sir.

440
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,687
Then what are you?

441
00:56:08,765 --> 00:56:14,328
I am a fool. Wamba, the fool of my master,
Cedric of Rotherwood.

442
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:15,496
A Saxon?

443
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:20,373
- A noble Saxon, sir. And a prisoner.
- Prisoner? Where?

444
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:25,745
Front-de-Boeuf's castle. With his ward,
the Lady Rowena and the noble Athelstane.

445
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:29,717
There is also... Would you mind, sir?

446
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,917
Thank you.

447
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:39,928
There is also Isaac, the Jew from York,
and his daughter, Rebecca.

448
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:44,595
They were abducted?

449
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:47,693
They were indeed, sir. Most certainly.

450
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:50,137
Just as surely as you and I.

451
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,708
You? I? What are you talking about?

452
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:57,270
Look about you, sir.
The bushes are moving.

453
00:56:57,547 --> 00:57:01,813
Welcome, welcome, gentlemen.
What do you wish? A fool or a knight?

454
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:44,319
Release him.

455
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:50,265
The Black Knight.

456
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:53,325
The tournament at Ashby.
You saved young Ivanhoe.

457
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:56,633
- You hold that against me?
- Against you?

458
00:57:56,706 --> 00:57:59,766
There is nothing more dear to me
than the life of an Englishman.

459
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:01,868
If you are as good an Englishman
as you are a knight...

460
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:05,436
...then I hold you in esteem.
Why do you pass our way?

461
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:07,483
The shortest distance to York.

462
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:10,883
Then you must stay awhile.
Taste our hospitality.

463
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,820
Please. I entreat you.

464
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:18,054
If you truly love Englishmen,
help save my master.

465
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,061
He speaks of Cedric of Rotherwood.

466
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,996
The Lady Rowena. The noble Athelstane.

467
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:27,162
Prisoners, all of them.
Prisoners in the castle of Front-de-Boeuf.

468
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:32,869
For myself,
I would join any enterprise to save them.

469
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:35,410
- Where is Little John?
- On his way from Totherdam.

470
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:38,572
- And Will Scarlet?
- Just arrived.

471
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:41,707
And where's Friar Tuck?

472
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:44,981
- Did you call, my lord?
- Where have you been?

473
00:58:45,054 --> 00:58:50,321
Why, at vespers saying prayers
for all good Englishmen.

474
00:58:50,393 --> 00:58:55,524
It appears you've been drinking
more than usual.

475
00:58:55,598 --> 00:58:59,329
Perhaps a pious taste or two
of our sacred wine.

476
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:04,339
Do you think you're in suitable condition
to give us service in combat?

477
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:08,434
There's a hissing here,
and there is a weakness here.

478
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:09,944
I don't know.

479
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:17,451
Yes. They have both passed away.
I am ready.

480
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:21,115
Then come, my wicked priest.

481
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,749
Let us be off, Black Knight.

482
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,954
The fool will lead us to his master.

483
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:38,730
You want my life? Do you want my wealth?

484
00:59:38,808 --> 00:59:40,571
Is it too much for you Normans.

485
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:45,546
...that we Saxons still hold land in this,
our own country?

486
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:49,278
Very well, then, put us to death.

487
00:59:49,385 --> 00:59:53,287
I ask only that you free the Lady Rowena
in honor and safety.

488
01:00:05,735 --> 01:00:10,297
Norman swine!

489
01:00:10,406 --> 01:00:14,934
My God, who would have thought that you,
the descendent of Saxon kings...

490
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:16,808
...should be the prisoner of a vile Norman.

491
01:00:16,913 --> 01:00:19,279
...in the very hall in which
our ancestors held court.

492
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:21,613
Perhaps they'll hold us
to a moderate ransom.

493
01:00:21,684 --> 01:00:22,810
Dogs.

494
01:00:22,919 --> 01:00:28,289
Oh, my tongue cleaves to my palate.
Could they have forgotten to send us wine?

495
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:46,866
Why don't you sit down, my lady?

496
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:50,969
If I am in the presence of my jailer, sir,
I will stand.

497
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:54,949
Dearest lady, you are in the presence
of your captive, not your jailer.

498
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:56,781
I don't know you, sir.

499
01:00:56,853 --> 01:00:59,344
And no man dressed in spurs
and wearing chains.

500
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:02,891
...should intrude himself
upon an unprotected lady.

501
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:05,483
It's my misfortune
that I am not known to you.

502
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:09,122
I hope the name of De Bracy is known
to all in deeds of chivalry.

503
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:12,827
De Bracy?
I see no deeds of chivalry on this day.

504
01:01:12,902 --> 01:01:16,463
You are unjust, Lady Rowena.

505
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:21,203
Won't you allow, at least, the passion
of a man drawn by your great beauty?

506
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:24,473
Sir, you speak the common language
of a minstrel.

507
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:28,745
Well, perhaps bold language
best justifies bold action.

508
01:01:33,222 --> 01:01:34,553
I tell you now...

509
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:38,593
...you will never leave this place unless
you leave it as the wife of Maurice de Bracy.

510
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:39,719
Your wife?

511
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:44,926
Oh, I know. You have great pride.
I admire that.

512
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:48,197
It makes you even more suited
to take your place beside me.

513
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:51,707
When I do marry, sir,
it will not be to one who despises.

514
01:01:51,774 --> 01:01:55,175
...the manner in which
I have been brought up.

515
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:05,714
Perhaps you dream that King Richard
will resume the throne.

516
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:09,724
That is an empty dream.
I can promise you that.

517
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:12,784
His fate will be as hopeless
as that of Ivanhoe's.

518
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,886
What? Lvanhoe?

519
01:02:18,701 --> 01:02:20,828
Do I see a touch of tenderness at last?

520
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:23,770
Well, where is he?
Do you know where he is?

521
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:26,933
- I do.
- Tell me, I beg you.

522
01:02:27,043 --> 01:02:31,946
He lies gravely wounded
in a turret room above.

523
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:34,278
I don't believe you.

524
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:36,885
You didn't take the trouble to look.

525
01:02:36,953 --> 01:02:40,013
He traveled in the horse litter
with Isaac, the Jew of York.

526
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:44,188
Now, were I to inform our host of this...

527
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:47,093
...Ivanhoe will no longer breathe at all.

528
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:57,069
Smile, dear lady.

529
01:02:57,140 --> 01:03:02,305
Simply smile at my proposal
and he will have nothing to fear.

530
01:03:04,714 --> 01:03:11,244
I can't believe that your purpose could be
so wicked and your power so great.

531
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:18,652
There are others. Cedric, your guardian.

532
01:03:18,995 --> 01:03:22,089
The fate of all depends on your decision.

533
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:35,399
Lady Rowena, I would rather you kept
your original anger than this.

534
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:50,356
Be assured, please,
you have no reason for tears as yet.

535
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:07,137
I will leave you now

536
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:13,013
...to dwell upon your decision.
