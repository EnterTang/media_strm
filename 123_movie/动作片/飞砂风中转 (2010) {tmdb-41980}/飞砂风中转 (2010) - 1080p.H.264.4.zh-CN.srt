1
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,374
如兄弟寄托妻子儿女或重要事件
When a brother entrusts his family to you,

2
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:17,374
不尽心竭力者 不得好死
those who fail will die a horrible death.

3
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,749
不得好死
Die a horrible death.

4
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,999
兄弟钱财物件 须有借有还
Respect each other's property and pay your debts.

5
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,874
如有存心吞没者 生不如死
Offenders will face a fate worse than death.

6
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,499
生不如死
Face a fate worse than death.

7
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,915
不许搬弄是非 捏造事实
Don't spread vicious lies.

8
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:33,249
明知故犯者 死无葬身之地
Offenders will be fed to the dogs.

9
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,874
死无葬身之地
Fed to the dogs.

10
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:43,999
干嘛
What are you doing?

11
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,457
加入黑社会
Joining the Gang.

12
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,582
我是问你下面怎么啦
I mean down there.

13
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,582
我的纸内裤都湿透了
There's a hole in my paper underwear.

14
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,957
今后大家都是和义盛的兄弟了
From now on, you're brothers.

15
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:21,165
老大就是你爹 帮会就是你娘
The Don is your father, the Gang is your mother.

16
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:25,290
谁背叛爹娘天打雷劈
Traitors will be punished by death.

17
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:44,790
每人一个
Take one.

18
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,124
知不知道出来混
What's the key

19
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,540
最重要是甚么
for being a gangster?

20
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,665
是路
His path.

21
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,415
无缘无故的
No one...

22
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,832
谁会给条路你们走
will show you the path.

23
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,832
是你自己
You are on your own.

24
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,415
路是人走出来的
You have to find your own path.

25
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:09,040
我火水能从西环踩到上环靠的是甚么
How did I, Kerosene,

26
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:09,999
你们知不知道
expand my turf into Sheung Wan?

27
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,499
靠的是霸道 我这么霸道
By being overbearing.

28
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,374
上环的路哪够我走呀
But Sheung Wan is not big enough for me.

29
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,540
要走啊就得走大路
That's why I need to keep going.

30
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,040
你们今天叫我做大哥
Today, I'm your Boss.

31
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,582
以后这条大路就大家一起走
Together, we'll keep going.

32
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,999
上环不够走 就踩到中环
If Sheung Wan is not big enough, we'll take Central.

33
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,124
中环不够走 就踩到铜锣湾
If Central is not big enough, we'll take Causeway Bay.

34
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,249
老大开奔驰有甚么了不起
The Boss driving a Mercedes Benz is no big deal.

35
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,707
我要我的兄弟都开奔驰 那才了不起
I want all my men to drive a Mercedes Benz.

36
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,040
虽然你们今天吃面包
Today, we're eating bread.

37
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,665
但是我火水哥保证
But I guarantee...

38
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,457
迟早大家一齐吃顶级鲍鱼
you'll all be eating abalone soon.

39
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,332
那条纸内裤呢
Where's the paper underwear?

40
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,290
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

41
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,124
是刚才那只鸡
Is that from the initiation?

42
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,040
是
Yes.

43
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,249
怎么弄的
What did you do to it?

44
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:42,832
我把酒搽在鸡肉上
I rubbed wine on the chicken,

45
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,499
然后用叶子和泥巴把它包起来烧
wrapped it with a leaf and roasted it in the mud.

46
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,540
就是刚才用来遮住你下面的那片叶子
The same one you covered your dick with?

47
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,415
叶子是用来调味的
It's for the taste.

48
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,749
难怪有一股浓烈的虾酱味
No wonder it smells like shrimp paste.

49
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:09,915
谁教你的
Who taught you?

50
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,165
我们家是开大排档的
My family ran a food stand.

51
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,290
我五岁就学会弄鸡了
I knew how to cook a chicken when I was 5.

52
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:17,582
本来打算长大后自己开小菜馆
I wanted to open my own restaurant.

53
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,707
但我怕会像我爸那样要交保护费
But I didn't want to pay extortion like my old man

54
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,915
所以就来投靠火水哥你了
That's why I came to you.

55
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:23,915
是吗
Yeah?

56
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,874
是谁那么大胆敢收你保护费
Who had the balls to collect from you?

57
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,790
我派人阉了他
I'll have him castrated.

58
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,957
不就是火水哥你
You did.

59
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,582
有这回事
Really?

60
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:33,999
不过
Maybe...

61
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,207
也许这就是你我的缘份
it's our fate.

62
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,749
师傅曾经说过我这条命
Master said my life was destined

63
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,582
是"一将功成万骨枯"
to succeed over many dead bodies.

64
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,249
原来是虾酱的"酱"
Maybe he meant dead chickens.

65
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:53,457
对了
So...

66
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,499
你刚才说要开小菜馆
you want to open a restaurant?

67
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:58,874
是呀
Yes.

68
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,540
那你愿不愿意替我打江山
Will you fight for my turf?

69
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,415
试试看吧
I'll try.

70
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,082
好兄弟
Good.

71
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,749
你叫甚么名字
What's your name?

72
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:11,874
萧近南
RuPaul Siu.

73
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,665
萧近南这名字
RuPaul Siu?

74
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,207
多没气势怎出来混呀
That's lame.

75
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,415
那干脆就跟我姓火
You need more fire.

76
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,499
叫火脯
I'm naming you Roast Pork.

77
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:28,165
我火水哥今天就对火发誓
I, Kerosene, do solemnly swear.

78
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,915
如果有天我当上坐馆的话
When I become the Don,

79
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,332
有我火水的地盘
Roast Pork will open a restaurant

80
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,457
就有你火脯的鸡店好不好
in every district I run. Alright?

81
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:37,582
好
Alright.

82
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,374
好
Good?

83
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:39,499
好 好
Good. Great?

84
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:40,374
好 好
Geat. Alright?

85
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,540
好
Alright.

86
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,499
好兄弟
My man.

87
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,207
砍
Kill him.

88
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,290
砍死他
Kill.

89
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:34,999
老婆
Honey.

90
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:12,874
谢谢 谢谢
Thank you.

91
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,874
请慢用 请慢用

92
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,040
别客气
Help yourselves.

93
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,874
干杯
Cheers.

94
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,040
没有没有呀
No.

95
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,749
二十一家分店我都问过了 没有呀
I checked all 21 stores. Nothing.

96
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:23,790
都满啦
They're all fully booked.

97
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,332
史提芬伯格又怎么样
Steven Spielberg? So what?

98
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:29,665
我最后一张桌都留给冯小刚导演啦
I saved the last table for Feng Xiaogang.

99
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,624
什么冯小刚都不认识
You don't know him?

100
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,124
你还拍什么电影呀
And you work in film?

101
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:36,790
史提芬呀
Hello, Steven.

102
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:38,499
到香港啦
You're in Hong Kong?

103
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:40,874
住四季是吧
The Four Seasons?

104
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,040
照旧点那些菜好
Same dishes? Alright.

105
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,957
半小时后到 谢谢 再见
30 minutes. Thank you, bye.

106
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:52,249
老婆怎么有空来帮忙啊
Honey, how nice of you to drop by.

107
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:56,415
是不是又看中了甚么名牌皮包
Saw something you like... a handbag?

108
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,165
难道我用你一万多也要你批准
Do I need your permission to spend 10 grand?

109
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,207
不是这个意思
That's not what I mean.

110
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,415
我的意思是
You only spent 10 grand

111
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,832
我老婆现在还用一万多的皮包
on a handbag.

112
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,915
这么节省不知道该如何报答你
How can I ever repay you for being so frugal?

113
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,374
这样吧 我们下星期去日本
Let's go to Japan next week

114
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,082
去看新店的装修
to check out our new shop,

115
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,415
顺便逛逛街
do some shopping,

116
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,457
再顺便看看有甚么漂亮皮包
check out the handbags,

117
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,790
再顺便我们
check out the...

118
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,332
要不要带萧立和萧玉一起去
I'm bringing the kids.

119
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,249
我们带着孩子去干什么
What for?

120
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:31,624
我们很久没过 "二人世界" 了
We need time to ourselves.

121
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,999
还有我上网查过
I checked on the internet.

122
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,749
有家时租酒店
There's this love motel

123
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:42,332
我们可以一边玩 一边拍录像
where we can film ourselves in the sack.

124
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,124
滚开
Get lost.

125
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:46,749
可你答应过孩子们
You promised to take the kids if they got accepted to the elite school.

126
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,207
考上名校 就带他们去日本玩的
To Japan if they got accepted to the elite school.

127
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:54,874
他们真的考上名校了 这么厉害
They did? That's awesome!

128
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,957
这些年一帆风顺
Things are going well.

129
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,082
说不定老大一开心
If the Boss agrees...

130
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,665
连那根龙头棍也让给我摸摸呢
I'd like to get my hands on the Dragon Head Baton.

131
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,540
你很想摸吗
You do?

132
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,499
老婆我开玩笑的
I'm just kidding.

133
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:24,707
开玩笑
Kidding?

134
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,040
你答应过我 不再碰社团的事
You promised to wash your hands on the Gang.

135
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:29,582
知道
Will do.

136
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,457
你先放手
Please let go.

137
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,707
你试试不开玩笑再说一次
I'd like to see you get serious about it.

138
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,415
再碰 我就是混蛋
I'm the asshole if I do that.

139
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,749
走啦
Leaving already? Thank you.

140
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,499
谢谢 谢谢 谢谢 走了
Thank you. Thank you.

141
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,082
炎先生签的卡 已经超过信用额了
You have exceeded your credit card limit, Mr. Yim.

142
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,999
两个豪宅 二次按揭 五期未还
5 installments behind on both of your second mortgages.

143
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,332
基金有四期未供 三份迷你债券到期
4 payments behind on your trust fund and 3 accumulators have matured.

144
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:03,124
根据条款 我们需要取消你的所有账户
I'm afraid we have to cut our account.

145
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:04,124
不过这样
But then again,

146
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,832
我们银行本着
true to our commitment to serve

147
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,165
植根香港服务社群的宗旨
the community,

148
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,665
我们诚意介绍一个
we'd like to offer you

149
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,915
债务重组计划给炎先生
Debt Relief Plan (DRP).

150
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,332
王经理
Mr. Wong.

151
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,874
你该知道我的背景吧
Do you know who I am?

152
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,290
知道知道
Of course.

153
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:23,624
炎方瑞先生是社团和义盛的领导人
You're the Don of the Gang.

154
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,957
你知道我是坐馆的

155
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,499
你怕我没钱还
you still think I can't pay my debts?

156
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,415
不怕不怕
Of course not.

157
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,082
不过根据资料显示
But according to our intelligence,

158
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,374
炎先生的任期还有几个星期就届满
your term is up in a few weeks.

159
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,290
没这回事
There's no such thing.

160
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:38,874
没事没事
It's alright.

161
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:42,082
不如这样 我们有两个债务重组计划
We can offer you two DRPs for your consideration.

162
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,457
想推荐给炎先生 我组你祖宗
DRP, my ass!

163
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,999
你信不信我找人砍死你 再把这银行给烧了
I can chop you to pieces and burn your bank.

164
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,749
信信
Of course you can.

165
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,582
首先 说要干掉我呢
About chopping me up,

166
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,415
我本人已经买了保险 但受益人不是你
I'm well insured, but you're not the beneficiary.

167
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:58,374
所以干掉我 对你的债务是于事无补的
Chopping me up won't help your situation.

168
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,624
其次就是 这家银行也买了保险
The bank is also well insured.

169
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,707
碰巧受益人也不是你
But again, you're not the beneficiary.

170
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:03,665
所以你烧了它
Burning it down won't help

171
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,874
对你的债务仍然是于事无补的
your situation.

172
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,540
以炎先生的现状来说
Judging from your situation,

173
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:11,707
你参加我们银行的破斧沉舟债务重组计划
you really should join our DRP...

174
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,624
你再说多一次
I dare you to say that again.

175
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:14,915
你扫掉我的东西
Trashing my desk

176
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,332
对你的债务还是于事无补的
won't help your situation either.

177
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,832
大哥甚么事
What is it, Boss?

178
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,499
没事这里是银行
Nothing. We're in a bank.

179
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,165
是是
Yes, yeah.

180
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,457
没事没事
It's alright.

181
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,790
大哥走吧
Let's go, Boss.

182
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:27,624
我不打你就不姓炎
I'll fix you or my name is not Kerosene.

183
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,624
何必恼火呢 都是于事无补呀
Getting upset still won't help your situation.

184
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,915
打死你这个王八蛋
You bastard.

185
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,499
这家银行就垮啦 赶快把钱提走吧
There'll be a run on the bank, get your money.

186
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,249
一路走好 炎先生
I'm sorry. Watch your step, Mr. Yim.

187
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:36,290
这是甚么世界
What has the world come to?

188
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,624
我拿一千万公款来做定期
I take out a time deposit of $10 million.

189
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,665
昨晚看新闻说
When I watched CNN last night,

190
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,999
宾夕凡尼亚州有家甚么小银行
a small bank in Pennsylvania went bankrupt

191
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,499
被一个卖色情片的老板把钱全提走
because a guy who sells pornography

192
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,415
那银行就马上倒闭
withdrew all his money.

193
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,957
社团的帐一向由我管理 我当然要小心
I keep the books for the Gang, I must be careful.

194
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,332
本想给它做个压力测试
I gave the bank a stress test

195
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,999
说要把钱都提出来
by withdrawing my money.

196
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,790
真不敢相信这么大的银行
Would you believe a bank of this size

197
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,624
这点压力也受不了
can't handle the pressure?

198
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:03,290
那混蛋听了之后被吓坏了 又跪又拜的
That sucker froze and went down on his knees to beg.

199
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,207
谈不拢 还反咬我一口
He started to make accusations.

200
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,749
我能不还手
I had to do something.

201
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,749
真他妈的
Damn.

202
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,582
我找人把它给烧了
I'll burn it to the ground.

203
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,499
大哥
Boss.

204
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,915
我刚才在银行全都听见了
I was there, I heard what happened.

205
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,999
如果确实有困难 你早说呀
Just tell me if you need help.

206
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,207
我没事
I'm fine.

207
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,457
这几年你当坐馆
You should have made a fortune

208
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:22,749
也应该捞不少
being the Don.

209
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,207
我捞个屁呀
From what?

210
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,624
代客泊车 才收二十块钱
You get a $20 tip for valet parking.

211
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,040
卖盗版 都被网络下载给打垮了
The pirated copies are screwed by BT.

212
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,290
那些吸毒的
The junkies have switched

213
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,540
都跑去吸五百元的 "自助餐"
to those $500 buffets.

214
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,415
好了 想退一步海阔天空
So I take a step back

215
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,999
去市场收保护费
and tried to extort money from the markets

216
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:43,207
那些老板 居然说以后把钱只交给政府
but the owners would rather pay the goνernment.

217
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,957
银行利息又低
Interest rates are low.

218
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:53,165
管帐 管帐 管到我这种地步
I'm screwed right and left.

219
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,290
当坐馆 火脯
Some Don I am.

220
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,915
一三五坐差馆
Police stations on odd days;

221
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,249
二四六坐殡仪馆
funeral homes on even days.

222
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,749
黑也管 白也管

223
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,999
真是名符其实的坐着被人管
I'm nothing but a sitting duck.

224
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,332
大哥
Boss.

225
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:13,290
不行的话 你别跟我客气
You can tell me.

226
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:14,457
钱我有
I have money.

227
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,457
你以为你是奥巴马
Who do you think you are? Obama?

228
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,832
我这个金融黑洞 你帮不了
You can't fix my financial black hole.

229
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,749
下一任坐馆 万一要是被别人当了
Let someone else take over.

230
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,874
我恐怕比陈水扁还倒霉
I wish, but I have worse luck than Chen Shui-bian.

231
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,790
不会
No.

232
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,749
你怎么跟他比呢
Of course not.

233
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,499
好啦 火脯你的心意 大哥知道
Thanks for the thought.

234
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,040
再说吧
We'll talk later.

235
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,540
大哥 你去哪
Where are you going?

236
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:50,874
走路回家
Home.

237
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,874
你的跑车呢
Where's your Lamborghini?

238
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,457
没开
Didn't drive it.

239
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,915
我打算参加国际马拉松
I intend to join the marathon.

240
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,082
今天还差十公里
I'm 10 km short today.

241
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,040
大哥
Boss.

242
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,874
其实你可以随便找几个兄弟先做一届
Find someone to take over the next term.

243
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:14,124
然后再让兄弟们慢慢把那笔帐填好
Let him sort out the money.

244
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,124
这样你不就没事了
And you'll be off the hook.

245
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,874
你说找谁做好呢
Who do you have in mind?

246
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,290
再想想
Let met think.

247
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,249
一起想
Let's do that.

248
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,207
招牌鸡
My signature chicken dish

249
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,374
不爱吃
No good?

250
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:03,374
不是
It's not that.

251
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:09,290
想起找谁当坐馆 顿时 没了胃口
Thinking of the next Don makes me lose my appetite.

252
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:13,582
想来想去 不知道找谁最合适
I can't think of anyone.

253
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,165
慢慢吃 吃饱再想
Don't think on an empty stomach.

254
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,915
我去看看老婆要不要帮忙
I'll check the stove.

255
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,707
不用了
Hey

256
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,790
被我刚刚想到
I got it.

257
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:25,915
谁啊
Who?

258
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,374
你呀
You.

259
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,249
开玩笑吧 大哥
You're kidding.

260
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,665
我不开玩笑 再说一次 好不好
I'll say it again, I'm not kidding.

261
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,374
别闹啦
Stop it

262
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,707
一三五差馆 二四六殡仪馆
Police stations on odd days, funeral homes on eνen days.

263
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,665
黑也管白也管 我有那么多店要管

264
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,040
坐馆 我真的做不来
I can't do it.

265
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,040
你还记得你有这么多店
So you still remember your restaurants?

266
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,290
是怎么来的
Where did they come from?

267
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,832
恭喜 恭喜 恭喜
Congratulations. Congratulations.

268
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,999
火脯 我那票一定投给你
You have my vote, Roast Pork.

269
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:10,540
火脯 我早就知道你是当坐馆的材料
I knew you're cut out for the job.

270
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:11,915
放心吧 火脯
Relax.

271
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,332
我们这帮老人家都商量好了
We had it all figured out.

272
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:16,124
到时候我们都会支持你当坐馆
You have our support.

273
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:37,290
选坐馆
We're electing the Don.

274
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:39,957
选都不选 造假呀
Is it fixed?

275
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:43,249
剪刀伟 什么时候轮到你说话
Scissors, you spoke out of turn.

276
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:46,374
我有本事 干嘛不能说话
Why? I have the balls.

277
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:47,915
伟哥说得对
He's right.

278
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:50,332
有能力就要表达
He has a right to speak up.

279
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:52,874
况且 伟哥天生就有一副坐馆相
He has the look of a Don

280
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,999
伟哥出马 谁敢不服
No one would object.

281
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:58,624
谁都可以 就是他做不得
Anyone can do it except him.

282
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:02,915
为甚么 剪刀伟确实一副坐馆相呀
Why? He has the look.

283
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:05,790
坐馆相这玩意见人见智
That's a matter of opinion.

284
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:08,332
最糟糕是所有和义盛里的人都知道

285
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:10,040
他身边的得力助手阿仁是卧底
his top thug Yan is an undercover cop.

286
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:11,749
就他不知道
Except him.

287
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:13,290
有这么白痴
How idiotic can he be?

288
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:19,082
说出来你也许不信这个阿仁
Believe it or not,

289
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:22,790
是一九八九年警察学校的一级荣誉学生
Yan was an honored cadet in 1989.

290
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:25,665
还没毕业就被反黑组警司刘华给挑中
Inspector Lau Wah recruited him before graduation

291
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,040
开始他的卧底生涯
to be an undercover agent.

292
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:31,040
从今天开始 你再不是二五六四一
From now on, you're no longer P.C.25641.

293
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,207
走
Go.

294
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:43,415
一年后 二五六四一进了和义盛门下
A year later, he came to us.

295
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:46,749
但他始终无法忘记自己的警察身份
But he can't seem to forget he's a cop.

296
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:53,749
结果他一次又一次的暴露身份
He blew his cover again and again.

297
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,999
简直不把我们和义盛放在眼里
This is so insulting.

298
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,707
看他不是阿仁吗
Look. There he is.

299
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:03,624
本来我们计划杀一敬百
We meant to kill him as a warning to all.

300
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,290
但查叔说多一事不如少一事
But Uncle Tsa preferred to let it slide.

301
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,790
没想到却有意外收获
And we were in for a pleasant surprise.

302
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:10,332
刘长官
Inspector.

303
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,915
有情报
Lobster Bay,

304
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:15,457
下星期六下午三点 龙虾湾
next Saturday at 15:00 hours.

305
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:19,957
那批毒品后来改在星期五晚上交易
The cocaine deal was rescheduled to Friday.

306
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,415
平安无事
It went without a hitch.

307
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:24,540
从此以后 有甚么大买卖
From then on, whenever there's a deal,

308
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:26,957
先漏些消息给他 让他引开警察
we feed him with disinformation to shake the cops.

309
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,499
来我们为新一届和义盛的坐馆干杯
Let's drink to the next Don.

310
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:32,374
来干杯 干杯 干一杯酒
Cheers.

311
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:33,374
火脯 过来
Roast Pork.

312
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:35,082
拿着
Congratulations.

313
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,790
来啊
Come.

314
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:39,624
当坐馆应该开心呀
You're the Don, look happy.

315
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:50,749
干呀
Drink up.

316
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,124
嫂子
Nancy.

317
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:55,707
今天是火脯上位掌管龙头棍
Roast Pork now holds the Dragon Head Baton.

318
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:58,332
你不是想跟他挣吧
You want to fight him for it?

319
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:00,457
孩子们怎办
What about the kids?

320
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:03,832
大哥
Boss.

321
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:05,957
刘长官带了一队人来查牌
Inspector Lau is here.

322
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:11,749
这么热闹
What a turnout.

323
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:14,832
谈好谁来当坐馆了吧
Have you chosen the next Don?

324
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,915
逮捕他
Arrest him.

325
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:20,957
收到
Yes, sir.

326
00:25:22,416 --> 00:25:24,165
长官 干嘛要抓我
Why are you arresting me?

327
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:26,957
例行公事
Routine business, it happens to all the new Dons.

328
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:27,957
我们以前当坐馆的都是这样 辛苦了
Good luck.

329
00:25:30,875 --> 00:25:33,915
刘长官 给点面子吧
Show me some good will, Inspector.

330
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:35,874
好歹也给个头罩戴上吧
At least give me a bag.

331
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,165
伙计 就给他个袋子
Officer, get him a bag.

332
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:40,624
出来了
Here they come.

333
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:43,749
后面那个 后面那个 长官 让他把头抬一下吗
Sir, would you mind if i take a photo?

334
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:50,124
害甚么羞 来啊
Don't be shy. Come on.

335
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:53,915
帅的
How cute.

336
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,790
还不睡啊
Still up?

337
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:12,457
给你两个孩子找学校呀
I need to find a school for the kids.

338
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:14,999
那名校不是录取他们了吗
I thought they were accepted into an elite school.

339
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:18,499
他们现在是和义盛的坐馆子女呀
But their father has become the Don!

340
00:26:18,666 --> 00:26:22,457
还是这几家有经验 甚么东兴 洪英
These schools have more experience with the gangs.

341
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:24,707
他们坐馆的子女都在这里上学
Kids of other Dons go to this school.

342
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:25,790
正好他们有经验
They know what to do.

343
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,249
叫两个孩子尽快进去替你打天下
Send your kids there to start recruiting for you.

344
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:32,249
老婆
Honey.

345
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,665
你知道出来混最重要是甚么
What's the key to being a gangster?

346
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:38,540
是路
His path.

347
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:42,124
我出来混 是要把菜做好
I join the Gang because I want to cook,

348
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:43,915
因为我的子女要上名校
so my kids can go to an elite school,

349
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:45,832
因为我老婆可以用名牌
so my wife can buy brand label handbags.

350
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:49,832
火水今天不放一条生路给我走
If Kerosene won't leave me alone,

351
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:52,665
我也不会放活路给他
I won't give him peace either.

352
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:55,457
我要告诉他 这二十年来
I will show him

353
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,874
我不是白混的
I didn't spend my last 20 years doing nothing.

354
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:43,624
现在和义盛的抽屉底下穿了个大洞
The Gang is in the red.

355
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,040
水哥亏空了社团上千万
Kerosene embezzled $10 million.

356
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,124
我们唯一的办法
The only thing

357
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:49,790
就是把水哥揪出来
to do is finger him.

358
00:27:49,916 --> 00:27:52,624
太晚了 我收到消息
It's too late.

359
00:27:52,791 --> 00:27:55,082
说他想把那笔帐赖到了脯哥身上
He blamed the debt on Roast Pork,

360
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:57,582
说是用来替脯哥开菜馆
said he spent it on his restaurants.

361
00:27:58,125 --> 00:27:59,290
没别的办法了
We haνe no way out

362
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,165
跟他拚吧
but to fight him.

363
00:28:01,541 --> 00:28:02,874
怎么拚
How?

364
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:05,874
以前抢的当坐馆还没打够
People used to risk their lives to be the Don.

365
00:28:05,958 --> 00:28:07,999
现在不想当坐馆又要打
Now you risk yours so you won't be the Don?

366
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:09,374
兄弟们谁还肯动手
Our guys won't do it

367
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:14,124
有没有联系过兄弟们
Did you contact them?

368
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:16,624
这几年大家跟着脯哥做正行
Like you, they have gone legit

369
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,540
都风生水起全上岸了
and made a fortune.

370
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,790
孤家寡人的只剩我们这几个
We're the only ones who are still single.

371
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:23,999
不到逼不得已 也不好意思打扰人家
It's best not to bother them.

372
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:25,707
就说毒品强
Junkie Keung

373
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,832
吸到二百多磅重
now weighs over 200 pounds.

374
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:29,374
还有最能打的红蕃
Even our top henchman Indian

375
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,582
去年都娶了儿媳妇了
got his son a wife last year.

376
00:28:31,791 --> 00:28:32,874
怎么没请我喝喜酒
Why wasn't I invited?

377
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:33,832
有
You were.

378
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:36,207
他在骼骸头的店 请了五十多桌
He held a banquet for 600 at the Skull's restaurant.

379
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:38,707
那天你女儿发烧你没去
You didn't go because your son had a fever.

380
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:41,332
你们有替我给贺金吧
Did you give him a red packet for me?

381
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,874
有 替你给了八千八
I gave him $8,800.

382
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:45,124
谢谢
Thanks.

383
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:50,582
骼骸头 鱼翅有砂呀
The Skull? Their shark's fins stink.

384
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:53,082
当然啦 他还去跟无耻拿货
Because he bought them from Fouler.

385
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:56,707
无耻以前去买刀砍人还要吃回扣
Fouler took kick-backs even on our weapons.

386
00:28:56,833 --> 00:28:59,332
照我说 买海产最好还是三四八
I think DJ has the best seafood.

387
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:01,624
识货 当然三四八
Indeed, DJ is the place.

388
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,665
他的鲍鱼都是糖心的
Their abalones are succulent.

389
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:09,040
那海参 质量更是没得说顶瓜瓜
Their sea cucumbers are superb.

390
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:10,165
说甚么海参鲍鱼呀
What's this bullshit with abalones and sea cucumbers?

391
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:12,082
还是说火水这件事
Let's get back to Kerosene.

392
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:15,374
你们还有甚么主意
Any ideas?

393
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:17,249
我查过了
I checked.

394
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:20,665
现在警察局有个甚么罪犯自新计划
The cops are offering a Clean Slate program for criminals.

395
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:22,165
你放甚么屁
That's bullshit.

396
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:24,540
不如这样
Well...

397
00:29:24,916 --> 00:29:27,457
我们找水哥的结拜兄弟开山刀来谈一谈
Let's talk to Kerosene's sworn brother Quarry Knife.

398
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:29,915
反正他从小就占水哥便宜
He used to bully Kerosene when they were little.

399
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,374
但是这几年
Over the past few years

400
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,915
这家伙卖饭盒跟筷子给我们
the asshole made a fortune

401
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:36,457
都发了 还爱上了打高尔夫球
selling Styrofoam lunch boxes to us. He's hooked onto golf

402
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:37,999
天天打十八个洞
and plays his 18 holes eνery day.

403
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:40,457
水管那帮人就是跟他去打球的
Tube's men play with him.

404
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:42,999
自己拿了中港牌照 还开车上去呢
He drives to China with a HK-Chinese license.

405
00:29:43,416 --> 00:29:45,290
现在拿个中港牌照要多少钱
How much does a HK-Chinese license cost?

406
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,749
找炮仗辉 二十万就搞定
Firecracker can get you one for 200 grand.

407
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:50,832
不行 炮杖辉搞的 只能走西部通道
No way, his is only good for the Western Corridor.

408
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:53,082
哪有皇岗二十四小时方便
Huanggang is open 24 hours. It's more conνenient.

409
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,832
要走当然走皇岗
Who'd take the Western Corridor?

410
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:57,707
怎会走西部通道呢 提起皇岗 提起皇岗
Speaking of Huanggang...

411
00:29:58,166 --> 00:29:59,957
我们刚才提到的那帮兄弟
we were talking about the guys...

412
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:02,832
别说了干脆报警
Forget it, just call the cops.

413
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:08,165
老婆使不得
No, Honey.

414
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,124
我们这几年虽然赚到钱
We've been making money

415
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,165
但始终都是混帮会的
but we're triad members nonetheless.

416
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:19,999
水哥要我当坐馆
Kerosene wants me to be the Don.

417
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:23,124
他算得很绝
That's a shrewd move.

418
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,957
现在这局面就像 巴塞对南华
This is like Barcelona against South China,

419
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:28,207
受让一球
handicap 0:1

420
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:30,457
而且南华还少打两个
and South China is down 2 players.

421
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:32,665
输定了
We're doomed.

422
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:35,374
如果巴塞打假球不就行了
What if Barcelona rigs the game?

423
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,332
巴塞打假球会太明显吧
That's too obνious.

424
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:46,040
如果巴塞
What if...

425
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:48,874
被罚停赛又怎样
Barcelona is suspended?

426
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:53,040
小圈子选举
This is what we call small-circle election.

427
00:30:53,541 --> 00:30:55,707
和义盛搞到今天这地步
The Gang is in the present predicament

428
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:58,624
问题根源就是假民主
fundamentally because of phony democracy.

429
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:03,124
大哥话可不能这样说
Not exactly, Boss.

430
00:31:03,791 --> 00:31:06,332
根据警察总部档案室的资料
According to the Police file,

431
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:10,249
和义盛的选举制度是源自比例代表制
the Gang's election is based on proportional representation.

432
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:12,749
像查叔那一票
Take Uncle Tsa's vote for instance,

433
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:15,790
他就要向下面的二千三百六十五人负责
he must answer to the 2,365 men under him

434
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:19,999
而那二千三百六十五个人 大部份是来自走私及私油业界
and most of those 2,365 men smuggle petrol.

435
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:22,665
他们每月交钱给社团
They pay the Gang every month.

436
00:31:22,791 --> 00:31:25,540
交出来的钱就像选票一样
The money they hand over is like a vote.

437
00:31:25,708 --> 00:31:28,540
要是不满意代表的投票意向
If they're not happy with how Uncle Tsa votes,

438
00:31:28,791 --> 00:31:32,374
他们会选择不交钱 而对代表进行罢免
they'll impeach him by refusing to pay up.

439
00:31:32,541 --> 00:31:33,874
可以罢免的吗
He can be impeached?

440
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,624
那为甚么那些老家伙可以做那么久
Then why are those old goons still hanging around?

441
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,290
问题就出在这几年和义盛的生产总值
That's because the Gang's GNP

442
00:31:39,416 --> 00:31:41,290
每年都有超过百分之三十的增长
has an annual growth rate of over 30%.

443
00:31:41,416 --> 00:31:43,749
只要一直保持这样好的经济环境
As long as they keep it up,

444
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:46,540
就没人会过问那些老鬼在做甚么
nobody cares what they do.

445
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:48,040
所以
So

446
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:50,207
根本不是制度的问题
there's really nothing wrong with the system.

447
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:54,749
只怪兄弟们的公民意识实在太差
The guys simply have poor civic awareness.

448
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:58,499
如果可以在公民教育这方面下点苦功
We must do better on civic education...

449
00:31:58,541 --> 00:31:59,874
阿仁
Yan.

450
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:02,540
我真的没看错你
I was right to trust you.

451
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:04,249
小意思
It was nothing.

452
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,915
在警察总部档案室
The Police file room

453
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:08,790
我留下不少脚毛
is my crash pad.

454
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:12,249
大哥我先听个电话
Boss, let me get this

455
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,790
喂
Hello.

456
00:32:13,916 --> 00:32:15,540
明天晚上火脯会动手
Roast Pork will make a move tomorrow night.

457
00:32:15,666 --> 00:32:17,749
他要放火烧大星银行
He'll burn down Star Bank.

458
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:18,957
你先等一下
Hold on.

459
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:20,874
位置是沙田坳道
On Shatin Col Road.

460
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,082
火脯要放火烧甚么
What is he burning?

461
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:24,207
火脯要放火烧大星银行
Star Bank.

462
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:25,957
你等一等 等一等
Hold on.

463
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:29,499
说吧 沙田坳道六十九号
Go on. 69 Shatin Col Road.

464
00:32:29,625 --> 00:32:30,957
等一下沙田甚么道
Shatin what?

465
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:32,874
沙田坳道
Shatin Col Road.

466
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:33,957
"坳"字怎么写
How do you spell that?

467
00:32:34,041 --> 00:32:35,457
你自己想吧
Go figure.

468
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:38,290
沙田坳道六十九号大星银行
Star Bank, 69 Shatin Col Road.

469
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:41,707
便利店斜对面金辉阁桑拿楼下
Across from 7-Eleven, under Glory Mansion,

470
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:43,874
邻近三号线巴士总站
next to the No. 3A bus terminal

471
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,832
附近还有转接港铁站的专线小巴
with shuttle buses connecting to the subway.

472
00:32:46,958 --> 00:32:48,624
交通方便
Convenient location.

473
00:33:01,958 --> 00:33:03,999
你让我进来就是看你撒尿
I'm not here to watch you.

474
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:05,707
走走走
Get lost...

475
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:07,582
走呀
Go.

476
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:17,207
大哥
Boss.

477
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:20,665
刚才你说在警察总部留下很多脚毛
The Police HQ is your crash pad?

478
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:21,582
甚么意思
What does that mean?

479
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:22,540
我是卧底嘛
I'm an undercover cop.

480
00:33:22,666 --> 00:33:24,624
你是卧底
Undercover?

481
00:33:27,458 --> 00:33:30,707
我是说我有卧底呀
I mean I planted an undercover

482
00:33:30,916 --> 00:33:32,624
我放了自己人在警察局
inside the Police HQ.

483
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,707
怎么放
How?

484
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,207
这么容易告诉你 我的卧底岂不很危险
Can't say, it'll endanger my guy.

485
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:39,624
不说这些了
Forget it.

486
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:42,540
我有情报 火脯明晚去烧银行
I got wind Roast Pork will burn a bank.

487
00:33:43,541 --> 00:33:45,915
如果火脯被警察抓住了
If he gets arrested,

488
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:47,082
除了大哥你
who but you

489
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,915
还有谁能上坐馆这个位子
is elegible to become the Don?

490
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,707
对呀
That's right.

491
00:33:57,208 --> 00:33:58,582
沙田坳道六十九号大星银行
Star Bank, 69 Shatin Col Road.

492
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,665
便利店斜对面金辉阁桑拿楼下
Across from 7-Eleven under Glory Mansion,

493
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:04,124
邻近三号线巴士总站

494
00:34:04,291 --> 00:34:08,874
附近还有转接港铁站专线小巴交通方便
with shuttle buses connecting to the subway. Convenient location.

495
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:14,707
老公 烧银行好大罪的
Burning a bank is a serious crime.

496
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:15,915
有多大罪
How serious?

497
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:19,332
在银行门外的水泥地上放火
I'm burning the cement outside the front door.

498
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:23,749
警察只能告我游荡行为不检
The cops can only charge me for loitering or misdemeanor.

499
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:26,540
进去坐一两个礼拜
I'll be sentenced to 2 weeks in jail.

500
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:32,249
到时候甚么馆都选完啦
When I get out, the election will be over.

501
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,499
听清楚别搞错
Get this straight.

502
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:49,290
是沙田道 不是沙田坳道
Shatin Road, not Shatin Col Road.

503
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,082
对 那银行在沙田道
Yes, the bank is on Shatin Road.

504
00:35:11,875 --> 00:35:13,082
大哥
Boss.

505
00:35:17,458 --> 00:35:18,665
老公
Honey.

506
00:35:18,791 --> 00:35:19,832
没事的
I'll be fine.

507
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:21,040
警察十一点五十五分会巡逻到这里
The beat cop will be here at 11:55p.m.

508
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,749
你的手干吗
What's with your hand?

509
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:13,082
没有
Nothing.

510
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:15,790
我在打拍子
Counting the beat.

511
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:17,207
我不是问你在干吗
Not that

512
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:19,207
是问你的手怎么了
I mean your hand.

513
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:21,124
你不是弄伤右手的吗
I thought you injured your right hand.

514
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,415
这就是右手呀
This is my right hand.

515
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:32,165
你当我白痴啊 这只是右手
Am I stupid? That's your right hand?

516
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,415
这只呀
I mean this one.

517
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:37,499
是这只呀
This one.

518
00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:40,957
你说清楚点嘛
Make yourself clear.

519
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:43,207
你是说你的右
You mean your right?

520
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:44,499
当然
Yes.

521
00:37:44,541 --> 00:37:47,207
我以为你指的是我的右嘛
I thought you meant my right.

522
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:53,124
那我对不起了 是我不对
Sorry.

523
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:56,082
你的手这么久还没好
Your hand is taking too long to heal.

524
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:57,707
去看我的医生吧
Go see my doctor.

525
00:37:58,041 --> 00:38:01,332
哪来的钱呀 你的医生太贵啦
How can I afford the medical fee?

526
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:04,707
傻瓜钱当然我来付
I'll pay for it, silly.

527
00:38:06,916 --> 00:38:08,374
那怎么好意思
I can't do that.

528
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:11,915
甚么不好意思 我们是兄弟嘛
Why not? We're brothers.

529
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:14,332
整天跟我说客套话
Cut the civility crap.

530
00:38:16,666 --> 00:38:18,790
我从小就没甚么朋友
I don't have any friends.

531
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:21,415
大家都嫌我笨
They all think I'm stupid.

532
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:23,707
我不就是没方向感嘛
I just don't have any sense of direction.

533
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:27,082
我老实跟你说
I'll be honest with you.

534
00:38:28,041 --> 00:38:29,415
多年来
After all these years,

535
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:32,040
我还分不出左和右
I still can't tell right from left.

536
00:38:34,791 --> 00:38:36,540
我有努力过
I tried

537
00:38:36,875 --> 00:38:39,207
就是没人给我机会
but people won't give me a break.

538
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:43,457
到现在只有你不笑我
You're the only one who doesn't make fun of me.

539
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,457
我看得出来
I can tell.

540
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:48,915
我不知道你怎么想
I don't care what you think.

541
00:38:49,583 --> 00:38:52,207
不过当作你是亲兄弟
You're my brother.

542
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:55,082
怎么了
What's wrong?

543
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,540
眼睛湿了
Why are your eyes tearing up?

544
00:38:57,875 --> 00:38:59,374
很感动呀
Are you touched?

545
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:01,124
没有
No.

546
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:04,749
大哥
Boss.

547
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:07,332
其实当上坐馆
Becoming the Don

548
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:10,165
也没甚么了不起
is really no big deal.

549
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:13,249
你有没有想过改做正行
Have you thought of going straight?

550
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:16,499
我已经做正行很久啦
I already did.

551
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:20,832
我知道当坐馆这条路 很困难
I know the road to becoming the Don is tough.

552
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,665
不过就算天塌下来
No matter what shit happens,

553
00:39:22,791 --> 00:39:26,957
我也会一个人撑住 它不会连累你
I'll deal with it. I won't get you in trouble.

554
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,540
也别说谁连累谁
Don't say that.

555
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:35,165
万一
If something

556
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:37,499
你有甚么事
happens to you,

557
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:39,832
我也可以替你作证
I'll testify for you

558
00:39:40,791 --> 00:39:42,999
把你转做污点证人
and turn you into state witness.

559
00:39:43,958 --> 00:39:45,874
甚么人
State what?

560
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,582
火水那帮人
Kerosene's men.

561
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:56,957
是啊
Right.

562
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,082
各单位准备
All units, stand by.

563
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:47,165
肚子饿了 先吃块饼干
I'm hungry.

564
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:49,915
不是吧 这样都行
How could you? Thanks.

565
00:41:14,416 --> 00:41:15,707
很好吃啊
Not bad.

566
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:03,749
你别动
Freeze.

567
00:42:03,833 --> 00:42:07,040
别动 把刀放下 把刀放下
Put the knife down. Put it down.

568
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:15,165
干嘛在街道撒尿 缩回去
Stop peeing. Stick it back in.

569
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:17,207
我叫你缩回去呀

697
00:55:02,208 --> 00:55:04,624
只用背后的动机来衡量对与错

698
00:55:06,541 --> 00:55:08,124
太深奥了
That's deep.

699
00:55:08,791 --> 00:55:11,165
这位前辈的辈份一定很高
This guy must be well respected.

700
00:55:11,625 --> 00:55:12,790

不是妈 是我对不起你

709
00:55:58,333 --> 00:55:59,665
我混蛋 我不孝
I'm an unfilial asshole.

710
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:02,040
傻瓜
Don't be silly.

711
00:56:02,208 --> 00:56:05,124
你为社团做事 就是为祖先做事
You work for the Gang and your ancestors.

712
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:07,290
为祖先做事就是孝 你这么孝义
That makes you a filial son.

713
00:56:07,583 --> 00:56:11,457
妈在尖沙嘴包了个夜场

全场美女都归你

你说甚么鬼话呀

你不干黑社会去读书

不怕天打雷劈呀

00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:58,207
老妈 我去上大学
You're not happy

736
00:56:58,458 --> 00:56:59,499
你不高兴吗
I'm going to college?

737
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:03,374

我错怪你了 乖儿子
I'm sorry, Baby.

老妈
Mom.

你没听清楚吗我去读书

749
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:37,040
不是去招兵买马当坐馆
I'm not recruiting new members.

750
00:57:37,166 --> 00:57:38,082

你不当老大不干黑社会
If you're not the Don

752
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:41,582
谁供我吸毒
you'll cut off my supply.

753
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,249
你是不是想整死老妈
Are you trying to kill me?

754
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:44,374
你趁早把它戒了
You should quit.

755
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,624
我趁早弄死我自己
I'd rather kill myself first.

756
00:57:46,791 --> 00:57:48,999
东浦仔给我捡起来

Understand?

764
00:58:28,166 --> 00:58:30,374
混蛋 你出世起那天就是黑社会
You were born into the Gang.

765
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:33,165
你一辈子都是黑社会 没得选择
You'll always be in the Gang. You have no choice.

766
00:58:36,083 --> 00:58:37,415

767
00:58:38,583 --> 00:58:40,207

你们都有得选择

If there's nothing else, I'll be reading in my room.

771
00:58:57,666 --> 00:59:00,457
天助我也
God is on my side.

772
00:59:02,083 --> 00:59:06,374
竟然杀出个甚么燕子文

00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:12,707
大哥
Boss.

777

真是天助我也
God is on my side.

778
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,540
燕子文坐牢坐傻了
Swallow screwed up his brain in jail.

779
00:59:21,166 --> 00:59:24,207
说要考大学 不肯当坐馆
He wants to go to college instead.

780
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,957
那枝龙尾棍
The Dragon Tail Baton?

781
00:59:30,666 --> 00:59:32,707
查叔他乱说的
Uncle Tsa made that up.

782
00:59:32,833 --> 00:59:35,290
哪有甚么龙尾棍 随便找一根就行了
There's no such thing. Just make it up.

783
00:59:35,541 --> 00:59:37,165
那也不能太随便吧 大哥
You can't be too casual.

784
00:59:38,333 --> 00:59:40,374
你又搞甚么花样
What are you up to?

785

直到你当上坐馆为止

791
01:00:05,125 --> 01:00:06,082
好啊
Very well.

792
01:00:06,333 --> 01:00:07,540
你也知道
Just to ensure.

793
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:11,457
我是怕有人从中作梗
No one gets in the way

794
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:15,957
对 对
Right.

795
01:00:16,083 --> 01:00:18,249
吃饭啦 嫂子 都凉了
Let's eat before the food gets cold.

796
01:00:20,333 --> 01:00:21,915
怎么搞的
What the hell?

797
01:00:22,083 --> 01:00:25,249
半路杀出个燕子文 我岂不是又要等
Who's this Swallow? I have to wait again?

798
01:00:25,333 --> 01:00:26,540
没关系大哥
It doesn't matter, Boss.

799
01:00:26,958 --> 01:00:28,165
等你当上坐馆
If you become the Don...

800
01:00:29,875 --> 01:00:31,915
你就没时间修指甲了
You won't time to do your nails.

801
01:00:33,375 --> 01:00:34,290
大哥
Well.

802
01:00:35,166 --> 01:00:36,457
要涂甚么颜色
What pattern do you like?

803
01:00:37,541 --> 01:00:38,707
晶亮油
Lacquer?

804
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,624
师傅说我最近欠火
The Master said the color red would be good for me.

聊两句吗
May I have a word?

809
01:01:05,625 --> 01:01:07,207
你说话呀
Speak up.

810
01:01:07,375 --> 01:01:09,207
让我站一会行吗
Let me just stand for a while.

811
01:01:20,916 --> 01:01:23,624
站够了没有 有话快说
Hurry up and spit it out.

812
01:01:24,666 --> 01:01:26,124
老实说 伟哥
I'll be honest with you, Scissors.

813
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:30,124
火脯哥呢 他心中有数
Roast Pork knows his limits.

814
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:32,415
坐馆这位子他没本事
He's not cut out to be the Don.

815
01:01:32,583 --> 01:01:38,165
但伟哥你就不一样 你是兵器世家呀
But you're different. You come from a family of weapons.

816
01:01:38,291 --> 01:01:40,499
你不坐就太可惜了
It's such a shame if you don't make it.

817
01:01:40,833 --> 01:01:42,749
所以 给你出了个好主意
I have an idea.

818
01:01:42,875 --> 01:01:45,999
只要你能够让燕子文进大学
If Swallow is accepted into the University,

819
01:01:46,125 --> 01:01:47,999
到时 坐馆这位子除了你
You'll be the Don.

820
01:01:48,166 --> 01:01:49,624
谁还有资格啊
No one else is qualified.

821
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:51,124
你用得着这么大声吗

822
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:53,040
我怕你听不见嘛

What happened?

827
01:02:15,125 --> 01:02:17,707

They... ran over a dog.

828
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:18,957
甚么狗
What dog?

829
01:02:19,166 --> 01:02:21,707
混蛋 你怎么过马路的
Watch where you're going, asshole.

830

刘长官
Inspector Lau.

831

有情报
I have intel

832
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,415

833
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:37,999
拜托
Thank you.

834
01:02:46,916 --> 01:02:51,082
你们三个不怕你大哥杀了你们
Swallow said he'd kill you.

835
01:02:51,291 --> 01:02:55,290
这二十年
For the past 20 years, thanks to you

836
01:02:55,416 --> 01:02:57,249
要不是鸭梨姐你啊 我们早就没命了
our lives have been spared.

837
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:00,915
就是 我们一直把你当亲妈妈
You're like our mother.

838
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:03,624
大哥去了图书馆温习
Swallow is at the library.

839
01:03:03,916 --> 01:03:05,082
这顿就抽饱点
Enjoy this while you can.

840
01:03:07,666 --> 01:03:11,332
那臭小子能像你们三个这么懂事就好了
It'd be great if he's sensible like you.

841
01:03:12,125 --> 01:03:15,540
鸭梨姐 文哥明天去港大面试
He has an interview at HKU tomorrow.

842
01:03:17,041 --> 01:03:18,540
是吗
Really?

843
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,624
看我明天怎样教儿子
Watch me teach him a lesson.

844
01:03:48,041 --> 01:03:49,332
麻烦你
Thank you.

845
01:03:55,875 --> 01:03:58,040
有句话说
There's a saying:

846
01:03:58,166 --> 01:04:01,874
当市场出现垄断的时候
When there's monopoly in the market,

847
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:07,499
市场就会产生毁灭自身的机制
the market will kick off a self destructiνe mechanism.

848
01:04:07,708 --> 01:04:12,290
我们大学本着有教无类的精神
The University is open to all students

更逼我们一定要录取你

852
01:04:23,708 --> 01:04:26,624

If you don't understand "monopoly brings destruction",

853
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:29,415

862
01:05:00,458 --> 01:05:01,457
宝贝儿子

863
01:05:01,916 --> 01:05:04,790
一直以来 哪次妈不撑你

谁给胆子你们三个 跟我妈一起疯
Where did you get the nerve to mess around with my Mom?

868
01:05:16,666 --> 01:05:19,124
我们没疯 我们是为大哥做事
We're doing this for you.

869
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:20,999
我们是为大哥做事

香港大学校长刚刚宣布 永不录取燕子文
The dean of HKU just announced they'd never admit Swallow.

878
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:18,415

最多做完之后
When the term is up,

910
01:08:13,125 --> 01:08:15,624
你爱读甚么就读甚么

911
01:08:15,875 --> 01:08:19,832
要我戒甚么就戒甚么

916
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,832
是个厨师对吧
a chef?

917
01:08:38,125 --> 01:08:40,499
现在人家都踩到头上了
He's stepping on your toes.

918
01:08:40,666 --> 01:08:42,790
你以为能躲得了吗
You can't run away.

919
01:08:44,958 --> 01:08:46,582
阿仁
Yan.

01:08:47,708 --> 01:08:50,207
这个警察好面熟呀
The cop looks familiar.

921
01:08:51,708 --> 01:08:53,915

Is he one of mine?

922
01:09:14,541 --> 01:09:16,707
十五分钟后给我摆平
You have 15 minutes to settle this

923
01:09:16,875 --> 01:09:20,165

926
01:09:33,416 --> 01:09:35,290
和义盛
The name of the Gang is Wo Yee Sing

927
01:09:35,958 --> 01:09:39,790
以"和"为贵 以"义"为先 以为"盛"世
which stands for "peace loyalty and prosperity".

928
01:09:39,958 --> 01:09:42,582
这三个字就因为有些人吃古不化
Because some people are a stick-in-the-mud,

929
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:45,415
才弄到今天这样不三不四
the name is now neither here nor there.

930
01:09:45,541 --> 01:09:47,082
甚么不三不四
What do you mean?

931
01:09:47,208 --> 01:09:51,207
这三个字是我爷爷和几位开山祖师
My Grandpa and other founding fathers used this name

932
01:09:51,375 --> 01:09:56,582
在油麻地卖假首饰骗南洋华侨的店名
for the shop in Yaumatei to sell fake jewelry.

933
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:58,915
商业登记也是买回来的
They bribed the government for the business license.

934
01:09:59,083 --> 01:10:03,290
白痴 以和为贵
Peace? Don't make me laugh.

935
01:10:03,416 --> 01:10:05,874
你没文化 我懒得理你
That's because you're uncivilized.

936
01:10:06,458 --> 01:10:08,249
火脯 还不告诉人家
Tell them, Roast Pork,

937
01:10:08,458 --> 01:10:10,707
有哪几家殡仪馆是我小兄弟开的

939
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,124
那几家墓埠店的名片给他们
of the tombstone shop in Chai Wan,

940
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:17,124
免得人家来不及预订 要横尸街头
in case they die before they have time to order one.

941
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:20,874
宝贝儿子 给我数清楚人头
Baby, give me a headcount

942
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:23,415
到时要送花圈帛金
so I'll send enough wreaths.

943
01:10:23,541 --> 01:10:28,915
当坐馆的 这些礼是少不了的
As the Don, you must not be stingy or people will talk.

944
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,832
别让人说闲话 一人少一句行不行啊
Stop arguing.

945
01:10:31,208 --> 01:10:33,999
在人家的地方还狗咬狗的
We're in a Police station.

946
01:10:34,416 --> 01:10:36,165
多没面子
This is so embarrassing.

947
01:10:36,458 --> 01:10:40,124
都说了谁找回龙尾棍 就谁当坐馆嘛
It's decided whoever finds the Dragon Tail Baton will be the Don.

948
01:10:40,208 --> 01:10:41,665
好 你说的
Fine. You said it.

949
01:10:41,791 --> 01:10:44,165
找到龙尾棍就是坐馆
Whoever finds it will be the Don.

950
01:10:44,375 --> 01:10:46,249
表示人人都有机会
It's fair game.

951
01:10:46,333 --> 01:10:49,374
民主万岁 还政于民
Long live democracy.

952
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:53,332
甚么龙尾棍呀 甚么样子
Dragon Tail Baton? What does it look like?

953
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,999
龙尾棍上面 有你爷爷

你搞得我不爽
If I'm not happy

958
01:11:13,250 --> 01:11:15,290
我就搞你全家
it's your family's ass.

959
01:11:16,375 --> 01:11:17,749
你说甚么
What did you say?

960
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:20,040
听不明白
You don't get it?

961
01:11:20,625 --> 01:11:23,749
搞你 全家
Your... family's... ass.

962
01:11:25,083 --> 01:11:28,790
这么说 我也可以搞你的亲人

963
01:11:29,333 --> 01:11:30,415
你能吗
Can you?

964
01:11:31,083 --> 01:11:31,999
好啊
Very well.

965
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:36,707
八月十五 我拿龙尾棍去香堂祭祖的时候
On August 15, when I hold the Baton and offer incense,

966
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:40,124
我当上坐馆 别说搞你亲人
I'll be the Don. Your mother is not the only one.

967
01:11:40,708 --> 01:11:43,165
你敢转身 我连你都搞了
I might come after you too.

968
01:11:43,375 --> 01:11:44,582
真的吗
Is that a promise?

969
01:11:45,041 --> 01:11:46,457
要看谁的手腕够硬
We'll see who has the balls.

970
01:11:59,125 --> 01:12:02,874
要是想缩 记得通知

971
01:12:10,083 --> 01:12:11,290

怎么样
Well?

978

小心 这凳子不能坐
Don't sit on it.

979
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,749
这样子是光绪年的东西了
This stool is from the period 1875-1908,

980
01:14:10,958 --> 01:14:12,957
差不多是大刀王五那时候
about the time of the Iron Bodyguard.

981
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:16,499
我那个大刀王五是戴麟趾的年代呀
I only know Chang Cheh's Iron Bodyguard.

982

大哥
Boss.

983
01:14:18,125 --> 01:14:19,540
虽然是假的
It's a fake

984
01:14:20,375 --> 01:14:22,749
但也要假得像真的才行
but it must look like the real thing.

985
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:24,832
谢谢
Thanks.

986
01:14:26,458 --> 01:14:29,207

Still, you paid a fortune.

987
01:14:29,416 --> 01:14:30,874

Why give it to me?

989
01:14:38,291 --> 01:14:41,624
燕子文召集了上千人

1049
01:23:35,333 --> 01:23:37,457
就两根棍子 要验这么久
What's taking so long?

1050
01:23:37,583 --> 01:23:39,374
外形来的 还要研究
What's there to look at?

1051
01:23:39,791 --> 01:23:41,124
多验也没坏处

Those batons. Who cares if they're real?

1057
01:23:58,166 --> 01:23:59,290
不重要
You're right.

那才是最重要的
That's more important.

1060
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:09,332
江湖规矩
We'll do it the old way.

1061
01:24:10,958 --> 01:24:12,582
单挑
One on one.

1062
01:24:54,166 --> 01:25:01,582

这边才是左嘛
This is left.

1070
01:25:40,958 --> 01:25:43,915
你说清楚点 我以为你是说我的左
I thought you meant my left.

1071
01:25:44,041 --> 01:25:45,832
你的左跟我的左不都一样吗
Your left is the same as my left.

1072
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,290
怎么会一样 你看后视镜
No it's not, look in the rear view mirror.

1073
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:52,749
这个是左 这个也是左 小心有狗
This is left, this is also left. Watch out for the dog.

1074
