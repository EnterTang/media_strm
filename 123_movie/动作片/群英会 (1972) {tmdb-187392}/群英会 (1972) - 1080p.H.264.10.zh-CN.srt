1
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,240
"Be a worthy successor to
ancestral greatness"

2
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,280
THE FIRST EPISODE

3
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,480
Madam...

4
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,120
What is it?

5
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,560
They're here

6
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,080
Go outside

7
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,960
Hurry...

8
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,840
Hurry

9
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,760
Pour some tea, hurry!

10
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,880
Humor them, I'll be right there

11
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,520
Coming

12
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,440
Ying Ying...

13
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,320
Mother

14
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,440
They're here...

15
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,640
Bastards!

16
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,160
Don't lose your temper

17
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,920
Come

18
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,440
I'll teach them a lesson

19
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,400
So they know we're not to be trifled with

20
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,440
Come when the tea is ready

21
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,240
Where is she?

22
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,600
Go away!

23
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,000
Move aside!

24
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,400
Yes

25
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,160
She's preparing your tea

26
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,680
See? There she is

27
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,680
Thanks for your trouble

28
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,560
Why such a big pot?

29
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,120
Out of respect for you

30
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,840
Have you decided?

31
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,960
I can't wait any longer

32
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,520
Ask my mother

33
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,600
Madam! Come quick

34
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,840
What is it, Master Shi

35
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,360
Need you ask?

36
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,800
I've been here many times

37
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,840
about a wedding proposal

38
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,680
Miss Ying Ying has finally agreed

39
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,440
Tell me what you want

40
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,760
Gold, silver, anything

41
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,720
Just name it

42
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,640
But the sooner the better

43
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,040
Ying Ying said yes?

44
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,480
Of course, she told me to talk to you

45
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,080
You're mistaken, I can't decide either

46
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,720
You must ask my husband

47
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,840
What?

48
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,360
Your husband is dead!

49
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,680
How can I ask him?

50
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,160
You're cursing me?

51
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,000
Don't get mad

52
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,480
He left word before he died

53
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,240
Look over there

54
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,920
That's just an old crummy bow

55
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,840
It's more than that

56
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,120
My husband's last word was that

57
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,080
Whoever can draw this bow

58
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,760
will marry Ying Ying

59
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,600
And own this bow

60
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,080
What if I can't?

61
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,080
You can forget everything

62
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,080
This is too easy

63
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,800
Hey!

64
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,160
Yes!

65
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,200
Draw the bow

66
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:04,880
Yes

67
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,120
Please

68
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,680
Be careful, don't hurt yourself

69
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,880
Move aside!

70
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,920
Bravo...

71
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,960
Wonderful!

72
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,160
Bravo...

73
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,200
Wonderful!

74
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,680
You have to draw the bow

75
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,040
And shoot with it

76
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,000
It's more spacious outside.
I'll lead the way

77
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:34,920
Come!

78
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,680
Yes

79
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,280
Take it outside

80
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,320
Yes

81
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,680
Stand back!
Master Shi is drawing the bow...

82
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,960
Quiet... move aside

83
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,480
Move aside...

84
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,440
Look, Master Shi

85
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,640
There's a crow

86
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,760
Shoot it down! Come on!

87
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,080
Are you blind? It's a crow

88
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,880
Crows are unlucky, you can't shoot it

89
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,480
That's a magpie, not a crow. Shoot it!

90
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,600
Don't let it get away

91
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,520
Bring the bow

92
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,600
Yes

93
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,680
Move back

94
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,960
Good...

95
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,160
Wonderful

96
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,760
Well?

97
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,720
Are you hurt?

98
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,360
I shot it

99
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,440
It's mine, pal

100
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,560
Sorry, it's my arrow

101
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,040
I shot it

102
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,680
How can you say it's yours?

103
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,440
Your arrow is over here, Master Shi

104
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,920
Damn!

105
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,160
Is this yours?

106
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,080
Who are you? You have a lot of nerve!

107
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,720
You're messing up my wedding

108
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,400
Are you looking for trouble?

109
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,000
Who are you? You're quite rude

110
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,240
Who am I?

111
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,400
You should find out who I am

112
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,800
I'm the magistrate's son

113
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,320
Kids

114
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:48,880
Yes

115
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,000
Fix him

116
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,280
Yes

117
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,920
Go back

118
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,520
Stop! Stop it!

119
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,640
Stop it!

120
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,120
Mother, he shot it down

121
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,440
I know. Take the bow inside

122
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,640
Hurry

123
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,480
Charge...

124
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,760
Move aside!

125
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,920
Master...

126
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,040
Forget it, Master Shi

127
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,400
You should stop too

128
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,400
I dare you to stay. Let's go

129
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,960
Move it!

130
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,520
I can wait, but just so you know

131
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,240
I have business in the capital,
I can't stay long

132
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,640
I'll wait one night

133
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,240
That's more than enough! Let's go

134
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,680
Go...

135
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,840
Step aside...

136
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,400
Go...

137
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,440
Watch out, Master

138
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,400
May I have your name?

139
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,440
Kuang

140
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,480
Please come inside, Master Kuang

141
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,400
Thank you

142
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,120
Doggie

143
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,200
Take Master Kuang's horse to the stable

144
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,080
Come in for some tea

145
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,880
It's my treat

146
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,840
Sit down

147
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,440
Please

148
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,880
I'll make some tea

149
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,240
Thank you

150
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,960
Ying Ying

151
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,640
Come out and wait on the customers

152
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,400
Ying Ying, wait on Master Kuang

153
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,400
Thank you

154
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,040
Have some tea

155
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,440
Thank you

156
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,800
Mother

157
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,280
What is it?

158
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,560
You...

159
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,360
He can shoot with the bow and arrow

160
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,960
Master Kuang

161
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,320
Are you visiting or passing through?

162
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,280
Please sit down

163
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,960
You go ahead

164
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,240
I'm on my way to the capital

165
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,040
I'm spending the night

166
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,360
And be on my way tomorrow

167
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,600
That's destiny

168
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,960
You mean...

169
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,720
When my husband died

170
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,760
He left this bow

171
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,680
Whoever can draw it can keep it

172
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,880
My daughter would like to consult you

173
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,640
What do you think?

174
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,280
I must be at the capital

175
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,480
Mother

176
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,400
Master...

177
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,920
Have you decided?

178
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,880
"Emphasize love and benevolence"

179
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,360
Well? Any ideas?

180
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,920
I'm still thinking

181
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,000
Commoners are easy to handle

182
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,240
Lousy idea

183
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,960
I got it

184
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,920
What is it?

185
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,840
Arrest that bastard

186
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,720
Trump up some charges

187
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,840
So he can't get away

188
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,520
Alright...

189
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,280
What if Father finds out?

190
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,640
Don't worry, he won't

191
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,680
Bravo

192
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,640
Catch!

193
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,040
Let's have a go

194
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,480
You first

195
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,160
Don't give in, Master Kuang

196
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,120
You'll be giving away a wife

197
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,440
Pardon me...

198
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,960
That's enough! Get up!

199
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,760
You'll never beat him. Get up!

200
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,760
We'll try boxing

201
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,280
What's going on?

202
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,720
Go take a look, Doggie

203
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,720
Open the door...

204
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,000
Hurry! Open up...

205
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,080
What's going on?

206
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,760
We're here to arrest a bandit

207
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,080
Open up...

208
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,760
Hurry...

209
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,360
The bandit they're referring to

210
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,040
I bet it's you

211
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,720
Must be that bastard's scheme

212
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,160
I'm not afraid

213
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,840
They're nothing

214
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,520
I'll get rid of them

215
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,440
Don't trouble yourself

216
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,880
They're calling you a bandit

217
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,880
That's a serious charge. You better go

218
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,920
They're after me

219
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,480
I can't implicate you

220
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,400
They're not after you

221
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,280
There're after Ying Ying

222
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,360
Don't worry, we'll take care of it

223
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,040
You'll get us in trouble if you stay

224
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,240
Take this bow with you

225
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,480
It's settled. Go now!

226
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,400
Open up...

227
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,760
What is it? What do you want?

228
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,080
Make an arrest

229
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,040
Arrest who? Don't you have a name?

230
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,240
We're looking for a bandit. Search!

231
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,520
Yes!

232
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,560
Wait! This is a tea house

233
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,160
There's no bandit here

234
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,200
Cut the crap! Search!

235
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,440
Yes!

236
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,840
There's nothing in the back! Go!

237
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,840
We have our orders

238
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,600
Search the place!

239
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,520
Yes!

240
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,240
What if you don't find anything?

241
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,320
That's none of your business

242
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,920
Then I must draw some blood

243
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,000
And give you an excuse

244
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,920
Arrest them

245
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,280
Stop it...

246
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,440
Stop it!

247
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,680
Charge!

248
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,240
Look!

249
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,560
Move away!

250
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,640
What's going on? That's stealing

251
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,880
Charge!

252
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,120
Stop it!

253
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,960
I'm over here

254
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,640
I dare you to come after me

255
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,320
Go after him

256
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,200
Let's go take a look

257
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,400
I dare you to follow me!

258
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,000
Mount your horses!

259
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,960
Come here, Doggie

260
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,360
What's with Master Kuang?

261
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,920
He's luring them away

262
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,560
So that we won't get in trouble

263
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,840
What if they arrest him?

264
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,640
They won't

265
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,640
He's heading for the capital

266
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,000
Those morons wouldn't dare follow him

267
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,280
Master Shi won't let us off easily

268
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,160
Let's go back inside and bolt the door

269
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,960
Useless morons!

270
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,080
You're so incompetent!

271
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,560
Yes, Master

272
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,400
Get lost!

273
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,600
Yes!

274
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,320
Go!

275
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,840
I really like that girl

276
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,600
I have another idea

277
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,680
What is it?

278
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,280
If they can't be persuaded

279
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,520
We must do it by force

280
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,920
Let's hear it

281
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,240
We'll snatch her

282
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,960
Nonsense! They're kung fu experts

283
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,840
How can we do it?

284
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,160
We'll take i $ Polar Beari... with us

285
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,120
Then we'll manage

286
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,040
You mean the Coach?

287
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,480
Yes!

288
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,480
"The Shi family wedding procession"

289
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,800
Madam...

290
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,440
What is it?

291
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,800
They're here

292
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,440
This time they came with the band

293
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,360
Move aside...

294
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,760
No wonder it's so noisy

295
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,400
This doesn't look good

296
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,120
You better hide

297
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,360
They come prepared

298
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,640
Doggie, Ying Ying

299
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,720
Get ready and watch for my signal

300
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,040
Get out...

301
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,880
What's this, Master Shi?

302
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,280
Congratulations, Madam

303
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,400
Bring them over here

304
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,920
Bring them...

305
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,440
Wait! What's the meaning of this?

306
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,640
Come here, Madam

307
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,920
Let's get down to business

308
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,440
I'm the magistrate's son

309
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,680
I'm good enough for your daughter

310
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,800
You played me for a fool again and again

311
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,080
I don't care whether you agree or not

312
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,760
I'm getting married today

313
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,800
Come, help her prepare for the wedding

314
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,440
Yes

315
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,440
Hurry!

316
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,720
Wait!

317
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,280
Let's talk about this

318
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,040
There's nothing to talk about. Hurry!

319
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,720
This is kidnapping in broad daylight

320
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,600
Do it!

321
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,640
Charge!

322
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,240
Catch, Madam!

323
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,160
Don't let them get away!

324
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,320
Yes!

325
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,200
You'll have an easy life

326
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,560
You're a bullying bastard!

327
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,000
You're dead

328
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,080
Your father will have no heirs

329
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,800
Damn! Tell the magistrate

330
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,680
Hurry...

331
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,320
Go...

332
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,480
We're in big trouble

333
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,280
Let's go, we can't stay here

334
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,200
Where can we go?

335
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,680
To the capital. We'll find him

336
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,680
Yes, we can catch up with him

337
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,000
Let's go

338
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,960
Mother

339
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,600
So be it!

340
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,760
THE 2ND EPISODE

341
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,080
The bandits are here!

342
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,880
Sound the gong!

343
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,600
Bandits are here!

344
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,080
Fetch the master

345
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,040
Take whatever you want

346
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,840
Please spare our lives

347
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,680
I want information on someone

348
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,200
Who?

349
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,280
Her!

350
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,640
That's Shih Chung Yu from the Rouge

351
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,320
Prepare the horses!

352
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,280
Let's go, Boss

353
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,320
We found out that Pang Xun

354
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,880
entered the city with a few men

355
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,480
That's odd

356
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,280
He had over 1,000 men

357
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,680
They started looting
every city from Xiaoshing

358
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,720
Why did he bring only a few men here?

359
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,840
They're lawless bandits

360
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,080
We must arrest them

361
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,720
Guard the 4 gates

362
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,800
Yes

363
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,880
General Ma

364
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,480
Yes, sir

365
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,760
Search the city with General Wang

366
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,000
Sir

367
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,200
General Wang is away from camp

368
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:08,840
Why?

369
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:12,000
He's obsessed with Shih Chung Yu

370
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:00,920
Sister

371
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,640
What is it?

372
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,560
You have a customer

373
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,560
I told you

374
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,240
I'm not seeing anyone
if General Wang is here

375
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,680
Sister

376
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,080
He'll pay 10 taels of silver
just to see you

377
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,840
Exactly

378
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,120
Ask for 100 taels

379
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,360
Give it to her

380
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,280
Thank you

381
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,920
100 taels

382
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,400
100 taels?

383
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,160
Tell her to hurry!

384
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,640
Wait!

385
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,520
I want to see her first

386
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,800
He already paid 100 taels

387
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,400
I'll give you 200 taels

388
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,440
300 taels

389
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,640
Talk is cheap

390
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,160
Show me your money

391
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,520
I don't have it

392
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:01,080
No? Then shut up

393
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,240
How much is this worth?

394
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:18,880
The dragon jade is worth over 10,000 taels

395
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:28,160
If you know, then run along

396
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,720
Stop it!

397
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,800
You can't do this!

398
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,520
You can't do this, sir

399
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,200
Tell her to come out

400
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,920
Go fetch her...

401
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,520
Here I am

402
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,080
Sorry to keep you waiting

403
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,400
It's alright

404
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,520
Excuse me

405
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,280
You just wanted to see me

406
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,520
What?

407
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,000
Only this for a dragon jade?

408
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,400
You're too arrogant

409
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,240
It's worth it

410
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,200
I'll go if you play the pi pa

411
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,800
I'm not feeling too well

412
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,000
Don't go

413
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,800
They say money makes the world go round

414
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,160
I don't perform forjust anybody

415
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,560
Don't go

416
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,880
Someday

417
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,040
You'll offer to play for me

418
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,480
Come back...

419
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,400
Your sister is too arrogant

420
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,440
She's not

421
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,000
She's in love with General Wang

422
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,200
She's obsessed with him

423
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,520
Make way...

424
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,440
Dodge...

425
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,840
Wait!

426
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,920
General Wang...

427
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,400
Someone is looking for you

428
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,720
He's asleep

429
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,400
General Wang

430
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,640
Minister Li wants you

431
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,080
I have to go

432
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,080
Wait!

433
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,240
Even if the Emperor summons you

434
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,440
I'm not letting you go

435
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,360
I'll come again tomorrow

436
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,240
If you leave now,
don't bother to come again

437
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,120
Minister Li must have an urgent matter

438
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,600
Who's more important, him or me?

439
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,640
You, of course

440
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,360
Then stay

441
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,600
Execute him!

442
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,760
Yes!

443
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,320
Beat the drum!

444
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,640
Wait!

445
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,280
Who's that?

446
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,280
Shih Chung Yu

447
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:11,840
Get rid of her!

448
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,840
Yes!

449
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,400
Stop...

450
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,240
What are you doing?

451
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,480
Don't be cocky, you've been to the Rouge

452
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,160
Nonsense! I've never been there

453
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,360
Don't bother to deny it

454
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,000
Quiet!
Don't let the minister hear you. Go...

455
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,920
Then let us through

456
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:28,680
I can't

457
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,960
Then I'll yell!

458
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,720
We'll yell

459
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,240
Alright

460
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,720
Just her, the rest of you go home

461
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,040
Arrest her!

462
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,240
Yes!

463
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,640
Stop!

464
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,680
I have something to say

465
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,000
Greetings, Minister

466
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,040
What are you?

467
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,920
Like yourself, I'm human

468
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,320
A prostitute is not worthy to speak to me

469
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,040
A prostitute is also your subject

470
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,880
I want to file a complaint

471
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,120
How dare you come here
after you seduced my man?

472
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,640
General Wang and I loved each other

473
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,600
I didn't seduce him

474
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,600
A prostitute in love?

475
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,200
You've been to a brothel?

476
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,160
Nonsense!

477
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,120
I'll never go to such a filthy place

478
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,280
How do you know
a prostitute can't fall in love?

479
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,280
What a sharp tongue!

480
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,120
I'm telling the truth

481
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,240
Gentlemen

482
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:32,960
Love is everywhere

483
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,000
Prime Minister Xie An
accompanies prostitutes

484
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,360
And Commander Yang Xu
hosts social functions

485
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:47,040
Guan Pan Pan of Yanzi Lou

486
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,480
Throughout history,
scholars and prostitutes

487
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,840
have left behind romantic stories

488
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:04,680
You're making
a mountain out of a mole hill

489
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,280
This is not discipline

490
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,680
You're just a heartless fool

491
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,400
Tie her up!

492
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,600
Wait! You're a high ranking officer

493
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,640
Tying me up is too easy

494
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,000
But tell me, what crime have I committed?

495
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,960
You barged in here and insulted me

496
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,840
I will execute you along with Wang Xing Yu

497
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,560
Sir

498
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,480
They call you the Tigress

499
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,720
I thought you're courageous

500
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,960
But you're a mere coward

501
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,880
Begging me for mercy

502
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,840
I'm not begging you

503
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,280
I'm thanking you for being our matchmaker

504
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,200
What do you mean?

505
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,160
You keep us apart while we're alive

506
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,960
But you let us die together

507
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,240
Of course I must thank you

508
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,000
Execute them

509
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:48,640
Yes

510
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,040
No thanks

511
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,440
I can do it

512
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,720
Chung Yu, you can't do this

513
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,640
I'm keeping you company

514
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,280
They don't deserve to die

515
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,960
Please go easy on them

516
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,200
She's guilty of insubordination

517
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:18,120
Wang Xing Yu is guilty of whoring

518
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,520
What are you doing?

519
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,000
People who have visited brothels
deserve to die?

520
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,240
Of course

521
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,280
This is fun

522
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,880
General Wang is not the only one

523
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,080
who has visited a brothel

524
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,240
You dare not kill everyone

525
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,560
Do you?

526
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,720
Quiet! Except for Wang Xing Yu

527
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,360
no one dares to visit a brothel

528
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,880
You're overconfident

529
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,400
Let me show you

530
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,480
Come out, those of you who were there

531
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,920
Come on, don't be shy!

532
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:50,960
That's right, come out...

533
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,600
They're not coming out

534
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,520
They won't admit it

535
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,440
Well?

536
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,840
I knew you're making this up

537
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,240
What can you say for yourself?

538
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,600
What now?

539
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,800
If they won't volunteer, we'll force them

540
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,840
Yes

541
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,760
Come out, sir

542
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,000
Minister Qian, I know you

543
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,680
Minister Zhao...

544
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:20,920
Give us a hand...

545
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,000
No!

546
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,600
Please spare me

547
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,440
Come on...

548
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:31,600
Come out, all of you!

549
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,680
Come on! Kneel down

550
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,680
Come out

551
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,840
Please kneel down

552
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,640
Come on...

553
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,280
There you are!

554
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,760
You two look familiar

555
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:48,920
Damn!

556
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,240
See for yourself

557
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,120
You have all been there?

558
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,680
Sorry!

559
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,000
Execute them all! Executioner!

560
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:03,600
Yes

561
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,160
Execute them

562
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,200
I can't do it

563
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,040
Why not?

564
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:10,040
I was there too

565
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,640
This is outrageous!

566
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,440
Outrageous...

567
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,360
Sir

568
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,040
Minister!

569
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:25,800
What's so urgent?

570
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,000
Madam is aware of today's event

571
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,240
She wants the sentence suspended
and meet the prisoners

572
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,240
Madam

573
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,800
Good...

574
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,920
Get up...

575
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,760
Who is Shih Chung Yu?
Let me take a look at you

576
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,600
Madam Li

577
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,560
Lift your head

578
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,880
How pretty!

579
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,880
No wonder General Wang is obsessed

580
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,720
He's not obsessed with me

581
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,880
I'm obsessed with him

582
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,160
Well said!

583
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,400
Prostitutes are skittish

584
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,240
They have no genuine feelings

585
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,040
Minister Li

586
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,560
What is it?

587
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,400
Madam Li, may I say something?

588
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,600
Go ahead

589
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,760
If I have no feelings

590
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,320
I would not barge into
the execution ground

591
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,640
I was prepared to die with General Wang

592
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,240
To be fair,
if visiting the brothel is not allowed

593
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,280
It should be in writing

594
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,840
If you despise prostitutes

595
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,280
You should close down all the brothels

596
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,600
This is outrageous!

597
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:40,760
By law, even the Emperor

598
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,600
does not execute anyone
who frequents brothels

599
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:49,200
Enforcing extralegal punishments
is a crime

600
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,320
How dare you!

601
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,560
Kneel down!

602
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,080
Did you hear what she said?

603
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,840
Of course, she wanted you to kneel down

604
00:46:58,960 --> 00:46:59,720
Mother!

605
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,800
Get down on your knees!

606
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,840
You would have made a big mistake
if I didn't intervene

607
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,800
Extreme penalty will hurt morale

608
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,360
How can you...

609
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,680
Madam, please forgive him

610
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:20,800
Please have mercy on him

611
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,560
Stay out of this

612
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,480
I must teach him a lesson

613
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,280
You're fair and strict

614
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,960
But to make the Minister kneel

615
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,560
in front of his men is not a good idea

616
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,200
Are you pleading for him?

617
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,080
Everyone makes mistakes

618
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,360
On your account, I'll let him get up

619
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,040
Thank you, Madam

620
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,160
Get up!

621
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,680
He won't listen to me

622
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,640
Get up!

623
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:01,760
Yes, Mother

624
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,400
He was mean to you, why did you intercede?

625
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,040
Forget it

626
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,840
You are so kind

627
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,440
If I had a daughter like you

628
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,240
I'd be very happy

629
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:18,040
Then let me be your daughter

630
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:18,760
Mother

631
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,840
Get up...

632
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,400
Such a clever girl

633
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,640
Sis

634
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,840
Kowtow to Madam

635
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,760
Mother

636
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,280
Get up...

637
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,760
Congratulations! You have 2 goddaughters

638
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,320
Get up...

639
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,560
General Wang has such a good eye

640
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,400
And found someone like you

641
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,400
Thank you for sparing him

642
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,600
Thank you, Madam

643
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,440
You may spare General Wang's life

644
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:00,040
But he should be punished

645
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,160
That's true

646
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:01,680
Guards!

647
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,360
Yes!

648
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,840
A beating of 80 strokes

649
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:04,880
Yes, sir

650
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,040
Let him capture Pang Xun
and redeem himself

651
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,360
That's even better

652
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,400
Go change and wait for my order

653
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,000
Nojokes in the Army

654
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,520
Sign the pledge to catch Pang Xun

655
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,080
And redeem yourself

656
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,280
Yes, sir

657
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,000
Hang on

658
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,560
What are you doing here?

659
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:27,920
To sign a pledge

660
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,080
That's none of your business. Get out!

661
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,680
Catching the bandit is my business

662
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:33,760
Minister

663
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,160
Madam has designated Shih Chung Yu

664
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,440
to head the mission to capture Pang Xun

665
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,720
How can a woman go to war?

666
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:52,440
What?

667
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,320
You're looking down on me too?

668
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,360
I'll show you

669
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,720
Mother is bewildered by her

670
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,600
Let her learn a lesson

671
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,200
Let her do it

672
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,800
We don't have extra men

673
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,000
I can only give you 1,000 soldiers

674
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:16,560
That's not enough

675
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,760
That's too many

676
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,760
How many do you need?

677
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,320
None

678
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,080
Only General Wang and a few men

679
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,240
are enough to capture Pang Xun

680
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:27,720
Very well

681
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:28,800
No. Pang Xu is ferocious

682
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:29,320
I know

683
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:29,880
He has a few thousand men

684
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:30,400
I know that too

685
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,000
How can you go?

686
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:31,720
That's my business

687
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,200
Minister

688
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,640
Never mind

689
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,600
Write down what she said

690
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,640
Yes

691
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:37,600
How long will it take?

692
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,640
Within 3 days

693
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,520
And if you fail?

694
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:40,960
You can have my head

695
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:41,600
Sign the pledge

696
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:42,080
No

697
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,640
Get out

698
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,680
Sign

699
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,040
What if I succeed?

700
00:50:59,120 --> 00:50:59,880
You'll be rewarded

701
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,040
I don't want that

702
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,000
What do you want?

703
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,960
Your respect for prostitutes

704
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,040
I want you to hail 3 times
in front of the camp

705
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:08,200
And say what?

706
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,480
My amazing god sister

707
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,600
Well?

708
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,520
I doubt if you'll succeed. Very well

709
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,360
We'll see about that, my god brother

710
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,560
Save your tricks

711
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,400
We know you're not a street performer

712
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,960
We have tailed you for 2 days

713
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,880
You asked about Pang Xun

714
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,760
Can't believe she did that

715
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:36,800
We used to follow her

716
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,400
And made a living on the street

717
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,720
My business with Pang Xun
does not concern you

718
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:41,520
You know who I am?

719
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,840
You'll be too scared when you find out

720
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,040
I'm Pang Xun's cousin

721
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,840
So we're family!

722
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,120
I thought you were a government spy

723
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:54,160
Damn!

724
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,240
You work for Pang Xun?

725
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,120
Get up

726
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,840
Sorry, we didn't know

727
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,160
What's this?

728
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,680
Let them talk

729
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,640
We're staying with Master Ma

730
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,560
Boss wanted to summon his men

731
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,520
And overthrow the emperor

732
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,600
But for some bitch called Shih Chung Yu

733
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,480
He's giving up the throne

734
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,360
Please speak to him

735
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,400
Run along

736
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,320
Come back!

737
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,320
Pass him a message

738
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,480
Shih Chung Yu is waiting for him

739
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,440
You're Shih Chung Yu?

740
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:39,920
Useless fools!

741
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,560
Get lost!

742
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,920
Get lost!

743
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,800
You were right

744
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,600
It was Pang Xun who
wanted you to play the pi pa

745
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,040
You can't expect us

746
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,400
to barge in and arrest him!

747
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,880
No, let him invite us in

748
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,680
This is a lady's strategy.
We'll wait for him

749
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:32,800
Say it!

750
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:39,360
I asked her to go after Pang Xun
because...

751
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,640
I understand

752
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,240
Say you're running off with me

753
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,440
We'll go away

754
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:53,400
And live an easy life

755
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:59,040
I took Chung Yu's jewelry

756
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,200
This should be enough for us

757
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,520
You feigned your affections for her

758
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:12,080
Will you do that to me?

759
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,480
Of course not

760
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,040
Let's go before she finds us

761
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,200
General Wang

762
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,720
Too bad you won't live out your plan

763
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,440
Stop it!

764
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,160
Don't kill him

765
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,400
I'll tell you

766
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,320
where Shih Chung Yu is

767
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,040
Go after her

768
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,840
How arrogant! She sat down! Get in!

769
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:24,440
What?

770
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:25,360
It's your mouth, but her legs

771
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,840
You can tell us but don't push

772
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,040
What a sharp tongue!

773
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,400
Do you know the rules?

774
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,120
In here

775
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,440
We only kill and fight. We have no rules

776
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,640
Kill and fight?

777
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,200
Yes

778
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:44,920
What a cute face!

779
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:48,640
How dare you hit me!

780
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,680
You kill and fight, right?

781
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,160
Damn!

782
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:58,000
I'll kill you!

783
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,320
Come on!

784
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,800
What's stopping you?

785
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:05,960
You think I'm afraid?

786
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,200
Stop it!

787
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:14,280
You're being rude to our guest

788
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,560
Quit the act

789
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,840
Do whatever you want with us

790
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,280
I heard you're here to catch me

791
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:21,920
Yes

792
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,480
To save Wang Xing Yu?

793
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,240
Yes

794
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:28,320
Is he worth dying for?

795
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,600
I'll do anything for him

796
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,080
Will he do the same for you?

797
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,840
I'm sure of it

798
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,240
In your dreams! Ask her!

799
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,520
Jin Hua?

800
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,120
It's my fault

801
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,760
It's not your fault

802
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,920
She's not here to catch me

803
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:55,640
She eloped with her lover

804
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,200
With who?

805
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,800
Him!

806
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,080
Xing Yu?

807
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,080
Now you understand

808
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,480
He lied to you, feigned his affections

809
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,840
And stole yourjewelry

810
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,560
If you want them, take them

811
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,880
Jin Hua, how could you?

812
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,440
How could you do this to Chung Yu?

813
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,920
It's not my fault

814
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,840
She's ferocious like a tiger

815
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,040
Xing Yu can never love her

816
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:44,960
Shut up!

817
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,040
I won't

818
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,160
He's not in love with you

819
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,800
You have no right to do that

820
00:58:58,480 --> 00:58:59,840
I wish I can kill him

821
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:00,960
Blade!

822
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:06,560
It's no good!

823
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,280
Do it!

824
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:26,240
I'd like to see your heart!

825
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,400
Sis...

826
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,080
What happened?

827
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,680
She's like that when she's angry

828
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:36,200
Hold her tight! Tighter!

829
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,120
She'll be alright soon

830
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,000
Don't!

831
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,040
I can't stand it!

832
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,080
Hang on! Don't mess it up!

833
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,320
Miss Shih, are you better?

834
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:57,400
Don't get upset over him

835
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,840
Me? Upset?

836
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,280
I know when to let go

837
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,480
Let's tell him about us

838
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,760
Please help me!

839
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,360
Why don't you tell them?

840
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,080
Fine, go ahead and tell him

841
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,960
We did what you did

842
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,760
Since when did that happen?

843
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,400
You kept us in the dark!

844
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,560
Congratulations, Boss...

845
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:32,960
You'll watch while
they have fun with your lover

846
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:36,240
Let's celebrate and get drunk

847
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,840
Quiet!

848
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,680
Let me sleep with her first

849
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,840
You're too old. Why should you go first?

850
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,440
Because she wants me to

851
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,160
Go to hell!

852
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,520
Who do you want to sleep with?

853
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:20,680
You

854
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:21,640
Really?

855
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,600
Of course

856
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,600
What do you see in me?

857
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:29,120
Your beard

858
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,640
Beard?

859
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,400
Shall we go?

860
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:39,600
Not yet. What about them?

861
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:45,520
Let's get them drunk

862
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:50,520
Whatever you say...

863
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,160
Quiet...

864
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:58,480
Don't fight, we'll take turns

865
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:02,840
The best drinker gets the first go

866
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,840
That's fair

867
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,160
Pour the wine!

868
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:12,200
Drink up!

869
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,680
I can't

870
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,280
I want you to

871
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,280
Come on!

872
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,560
I want you to show him

873
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:25,160
Do it for me

874
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:28,240
You must do it for her

875
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,880
It's your turn!

876
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,840
Alright, I'll drink

877
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,960
Excellent!

878
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,240
Stop...

879
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,400
Boss!

880
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:44,400
Boss!

881
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:45,040
What is it?

882
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:46,200
It's important!

883
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:47,440
Talk!

884
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:51,960
Let's go over there

885
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,560
I'll be right back

886
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,480
What a party pooper! Let's drink...

887
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,320
Come on...

888
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:06,240
It doesn't look good

889
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,000
Get rid of them...

890
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,160
Come on...

891
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,040
According to the scouts

892
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,240
The soldiers are coming this way

893
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:19,960
Watch out for those women

894
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,200
I've been to hell and back

895
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:29,000
Report back after you find out more

896
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:40,240
Where's everyone?

897
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:41,880
My sister is not feeling well

898
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,400
They took her inside

899
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,560
I'm drunk

900
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:50,800
Damn!

901
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,000
It's too windy

902
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,280
Windy? I'll close the door

903
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,440
Where does it hurt?

904
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:10,560
Here, my chest

905
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:14,200
I'll give you a massage

906
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,640
Don't go away

907
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:20,600
I won't...

908
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:24,360
Here I come...

909
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:31,000
No... l'm thirsty

910
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:31,840
Fetch me water

911
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,040
Sure

912
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,600
Get under the covers

913
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:45,600
Don't go away!

914
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,600
Here's your tea!

915
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,280
Let her sleep

916
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,280
Let's go

917
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:54,880
You go

918
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,000
You go

919
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,600
I...

920
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,400
I'll stay with her

921
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:03,520
I'll hit you if you stay

922
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:53,960
What?

923
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,160
Go help Chung Yu with Pang Xun

924
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:08,160
Alright

925
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:09,880
If you overthrow the emperor

926
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,640
What will I be?

927
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:16,440
You'll be Empress Tigress

928
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:20,080
Thank you, Your Majesty

929
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:27,000
What about him?

930
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:31,240
I'll make him the Romantic General

931
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,240
Excellent

932
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:39,040
Let's drink to that

933
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:48,520
He's throwing a fit

934
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,000
He should know better

935
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:51,720
Right!

936
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,080
He's asking for it

937
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,040
Let me teach him a lesson

938
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,440
You're such a...

939
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:19,440
Someone will fix him

940
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:23,840
Boss, I got it

941
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:28,600
Are you sure?

942
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:29,920
Positive

943
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:38,840
You!

944
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:39,800
What is it?

945
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:42,600
He said you're working with the government

946
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,080
You believe him?

947
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,520
Of course not

948
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:48,840
Boss

949
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,640
What else?

950
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:55,720
I'll know
if she's working with the government

951
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,240
Lao Si

952
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:58,920
Kill him!

953
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,200
You're no match for me

954
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,320
If you take my blade
before the wine stops dripping

955
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,000
I'll kneel before you

956
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,560
It's still dripping. You lost

957
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:42,480
You won't get away

958
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,040
Have you seen Shih Chung Yu?

959
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:45,880
Where is he?

960
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:48,280
Over here

961
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:54,440
Tie him up

962
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:04,760
Sir

963
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:07,000
Take him away

964
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,000
Yes

965
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,600
Well?

966
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:34,240
I lost. In 20 years

967
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:37,880
You'll play the pi pa for me

968
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,400
Wang Xing Yu, you're forgiven

969
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:43,880
Thank you, sir

970
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,640
What about me?

971
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,840
You'll be rewarded when we return to camp

972
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,760
I don't want a reward

973
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:55,000
What do you want?

974
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,800
Call me 3 times

975
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:01,200
Call you what?

976
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,400
Have you forgotten?

977
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:06,560
"My amazing..."

978
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:08,960
We'll do that later

979
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:13,080
I gave you Pang Xun

980
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:14,240
You owe it to me

981
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:15,520
Don't be rude

982
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:21,240
You should keep your word

983
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:22,720
Forget it

984
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,680
You made a promise!

985
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:30,240
I didn't say no

986
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:34,000
I'm all ears

987
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:35,960
Chung Yu

988
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,440
I risked my life for this

989
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,680
Go ahead...

990
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,280
Amazing...

991
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:57,880
Get out

992
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,200
Yes, sir

993
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:03,840
We had a deal, in front of everyone

994
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:05,800
Come back

995
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,400
Yes

996
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,200
Amazing god sister

997
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,840
Amazing godsister

998
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:27,000
Louder! I can't hear you

999
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:29,400
Amazing godsister

1000
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:30,080
Let's go

1001
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:31,320
Yes, sir

1002
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:37,200
You have my utmost respect

1003
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:42,880
Your portrait, Miss Shih

1004
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,840
Pang Xun left it for you

1005
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:53,920
Read the words on the back,
it's incredible

1006
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:04,440
He was a soldier under your father

1007
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:07,040
It was love at first sight for him

1008
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,840
Because of his humble origin,
he dared not tell you

1009
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:12,880
He loved you from afar

1010
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:17,920
He helped you escape
when the Emperor chose you

1011
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:21,840
But his family was executed
and he became a bandit

1012
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:26,440
Yet he could not forget you.
He looked for you

1013
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,480
And...

1014
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:33,240
I had him arrested

1015
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,920
Make it quick! Come on!

1016
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:58,000
The tale went:
Shihchung Yu spent lifetime in a brothel

1017
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:01,080
These were not heroes,

1018
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:04,800
nor did they achieve greatness,
but the robber...

1019
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:09,200
was sentimental
and the prostitute chivalrous at heart

1020
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:12,640
and so they were included in the trilogy.

1021
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,360
THE THIRD EPISODE

1022
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,760
Miss

1023
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,920
Look, Miss!

1024
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,200
Brother

1025
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:09,880
This is the White Water Strand

1026
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,240
It's known for its rough terrain,
be careful

1027
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,600
Escorting Brother Xu are
Ren Da and You Jie

1028
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:30,840
Both are pupils of Lo Tian Yi

1029
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:33,240
Known as Dual Devils of Hebei

1030
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:36,880
We must be careful

1031
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:38,040
Let's go

1032
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:42,240
We're government troops from Jinan

1033
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:43,560
escorting a bandit

1034
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:44,720
Is this a rebellion?

1035
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:46,120
You're the bandit

1036
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:47,600
Ren Da, You Jie

1037
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,520
We know who you are

1038
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:50,840
I'm Hua Feng Chun

1039
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:53,840
This is miss Xu Feng Ying

1040
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,320
You framed Master Xu

1041
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:56,840
Let him go

1042
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,840
We'll spare your pathetic lives

1043
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:01,440
You survivors of Liang Shan
are asking for trouble

1044
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:04,280
Brother Hua, save your breath

1045
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,640
Charge!

1046
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:19,400
Brother!

1047
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:21,680
Open this for me!

1048
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,000
You're safe, let's go

1049
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,920
These 2 evil doers

1050
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:33,520
We can't let them off

1051
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:36,560
Stand guard up there

1052
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:38,000
Let us know if more troops show up

1053
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,160
Alright

1054
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:25,400
Stop!

1055
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,520
Who are you?

1056
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,400
Put it down! You can't pass!

1057
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:42,080
I said don't go that way

1058
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:43,680
I must

1059
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,040
Go ahead and try!

1060
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:49,640
Stop!

1061
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:55,360
Sorry! I must deliver these goods

1062
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:59,480
to Jinan before dark

1063
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,240
I'm a hired help

1064
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:06,800
I don't have time for this

1065
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:25,240
Why are you still here?

1066
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:28,280
I want to know what's going on

1067
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:00,960
You're bandits!
You attacked government troops

1068
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:03,400
So? Mind your own business

1069
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,000
You're quite an expert

1070
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:41,400
Too bad I don't have my weapon handy

1071
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:44,240
We can't compete properly

1072
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:46,920
Take off those cuffs

1073
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:48,600
It's not fair

1074
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,320
Sis, let me use your Koulian spear

1075
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:54,200
It's shorter, but it'll do

1076
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:58,120
Wait! You have a tattoo on your face

1077
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:00,200
You use a Koulian spear

1078
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:02,080
Are you the son of

1079
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,720
Master Xu Min of Liang Shan?

1080
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,920
Greenfaced Tiger Xu Shi Ying?

1081
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,280
Yes

1082
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:11,480
This must be your sister Xu Feng Ying

1083
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,440
You're catching on

1084
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:17,600
My name is Mu Yu Ji

1085
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:20,800
Sorry I didn't recognize you at first

1086
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:23,760
I'll make it up to you

1087
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:28,320
Who cares? Let's go

1088
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,760
Don't let them get away! They're bandits!

1089
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:36,920
Please!

1090
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:50,720
You may go too

1091
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:53,040
You saved our lives, Master Mu

1092
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:55,120
We haven't thanked you

1093
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,920
Where are you going?

1094
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:01,480
Making a delivery to Jinan

1095
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:04,000
We're due back in Jinan, let's go together

1096
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:14,600
Xu Shi Ying is from an eminent family

1097
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:17,320
Why did you call him a bandit?

1098
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:21,000
I don't know. We have our orders

1099
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:22,800
Who are the others?

1100
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:23,880
One with the iron bow is

1101
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,040
Hua Rong's son, Hua Feng Chun

1102
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:28,640
The one with double whip is Hu Yan Bao

1103
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:29,440
The one with the blade

1104
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:32,040
is Qin Ming's son Qin Ren

1105
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:37,000
They're descendents from
the Liang Shan heroes

1106
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:41,800
Here comes Master

1107
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:12,560
That's Luo Tian Yi

1108
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:14,640
Master Mu

1109
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:18,520
I want nothing to do with the government,
goodbye

1110
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:21,680
You have saved my pupils

1111
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:23,880
Even if you don't want a position

1112
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,440
I'll make the delivery for you

1113
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:30,560
Let's have a drink in Jinan

1114
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:32,360
That's the least I can do

1115
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:38,640
Please don't give me the cold shoulder

1116
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,040
Alright!

1117
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:49,800
Mu Yu Ji is a fine man

1118
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:53,000
Why would he hang out with Luo Tian Yi?

1119
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,400
He's the 11th child

1120
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:56,240
Then he must be

1121
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:59,440
the famous Shiyi Lang

1122
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:01,440
He's such a kung fu master

1123
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:05,960
But he's also a loner

1124
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:09,560
He probably doesn't know about Luo Tian Yi

1125
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:10,600
And fell for it

1126
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:13,200
Serves him right!

1127
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:16,560
After all, he let us go

1128
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:20,440
Our country is being invaded

1129
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:24,200
We should make a friend

1130
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:25,360
Yes

1131
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:26,680
Tiger

1132
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:27,520
Yes

1133
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:28,800
Follow them

1134
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:30,520
Tell us what they're up to

1135
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:31,880
Yes

1136
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,240
Meet at the usual place tonight

1137
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,360
I will

1138
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:13,280
Make this delivery for Master Mu

1139
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:14,720
Then report back to the office

1140
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:16,800
Wait! I better...

1141
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:20,280
You must be hungry after the trip

1142
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:23,400
Let them do your errand

1143
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:27,560
Let's have a drink

1144
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:29,800
If you consider me unworthy

1145
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:33,560
You may go afterwards

1146
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:35,840
You're too kind

1147
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:40,600
I'll stay

1148
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:42,000
Please

1149
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:29,440
This way

1150
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:32,320
Please

1151
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:42,040
Master

1152
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:44,920
I drugged the wine

1153
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:47,240
That's what I did last night

1154
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:50,280
to Guan Sheng

1155
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:54,240
He's the state general, why...

1156
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:59,040
The state magistrate
has already surrendered

1157
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:01,160
He has been named King of Qi

1158
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:03,680
He knew Guan Sheng came from Liang Shan

1159
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:06,680
And would never surrender

1160
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:09,560
He planned to use him as an example

1161
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:13,720
I drugged him last night

1162
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:16,560
And took him to court

1163
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:26,240
Minister Liu has been named King of Qi

1164
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:27,840
by the Jin Dynasty

1165
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:32,120
These are ambassadors from the Jin Emperor

1166
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:35,400
Guan Sheng went against
the mandate of Heaven

1167
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:40,000
So I had him arrested

1168
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:43,800
What do you think?

1169
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:45,440
Well...

1170
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:52,120
If you're willing to surrender

1171
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:54,760
We'll release you immediately

1172
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:59,480
You'll be a founding member
of the new dynasty

1173
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,640
I'm a Song subject

1174
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:04,760
I will never betray my country

1175
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:07,360
You refuse to surrender?

1176
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:09,200
Never

1177
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:12,560
Execute him

1178
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:13,920
Yes, sir

1179
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:19,360
Execute Guan Sheng!

1180
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:55,440
Do you wish to follow Guan Sheng

1181
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:57,440
or will you surrender?

1182
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:02,520
We'll surrender

1183
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:07,360
Very well...

1184
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:28,080
Everyone surrender after Guan Sheng died

1185
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:32,040
That's why I'm late

1186
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:34,520
And Xu Shi Min managed to escape

1187
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:37,040
It's our fault

1188
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:41,360
Luckily we have Mu Yu Ji

1189
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:44,000
These socalled chivalrous swordsmen

1190
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:46,680
will never surrender

1191
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:49,720
We must kill a few to frighten people

1192
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:52,720
So others dare not resist

1193
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:56,320
You plan to...

1194
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:00,480
I'll report back to Minister Liu

1195
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,440
Tomorrow at noon

1196
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:07,000
Mu Yu Ji will be beheaded

1197
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,840
Brother

1198
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:11,200
Luo Tian Yi captured Mu Yu Ji

1199
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:19,080
I followed them into Jinan

1200
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:21,880
They took him to a restaurant

1201
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,880
Drugged him and had him arrested

1202
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,400
You were right

1203
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:29,840
I found out something else

1204
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:32,960
Minister Liu Yu has surrendered

1205
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:36,080
The Jin Emperor named him King of Qi

1206
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:39,800
Master Guan is dead

1207
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:43,920
Liu Yu finally did it

1208
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:45,280
We came to Jizhou

1209
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:47,760
to contact Master Guan

1210
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:51,240
But Shi Min's arrest detained us

1211
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:53,360
Now Master Guan is dead

1212
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:57,520
Liu Yu will let the Jin army through

1213
01:33:57,640 --> 01:34:00,600
We must alert the lmperial Court

1214
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:02,480
so they'll be prepared

1215
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:04,800
First we'll rescue Mu Yu Ji tomorrow

1216
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:07,120
Then we go south with the news

1217
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:09,640
I want to make it clear

1218
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:12,480
If anyone gets killed tomorrow

1219
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:14,840
Or if we can't save Mu Yu Ji

1220
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:17,080
We must break away

1221
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:18,840
Our lives are insignificant

1222
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:21,000
compared to spreading the news

1223
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:22,680
about Liu Yu's surrender

1224
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,160
But...

1225
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:26,640
This is forjust in case

1226
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:29,880
National security is far more important

1227
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:51,520
Bring Mu Yi Ju

1228
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:06,000
How dare you!

1229
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:09,440
Kneel before me and the generals

1230
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:14,520
I'm a Song subject, not a traitor like you

1231
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:19,440
I'd rather die

1232
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:21,040
than kneel before you

1233
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:24,760
We'll see about that! Beat him!

1234
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:32,360
Generals, rebels like him

1235
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:35,080
should be executed in public

1236
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:38,240
in order to frighten the people

1237
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:40,960
Don't fall for his ploy

1238
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:55,560
The rebel Mu Yu Ji will be
beheaded tomorrow in public

1239
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:57,680
I will personally supervise the execution

1240
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:15,040
I'm not afraid to die

1241
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:19,160
I'd rather die defending my country

1242
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:20,120
Take him away!

1243
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:21,400
Yes!

1244
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:32,400
Bandit!

1245
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:34,840
When is the execution?

1246
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,400
At noon

1247
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:52,320
Don't push...

1248
01:36:57,200 --> 01:37:02,160
Glazed candies...

1249
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:03,400
Don't push!

1250
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:05,360
I've never seen this

1251
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:29,680
Get closer

1252
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:31,880
I can't see!

1253
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,480
Look at those soldiers

1254
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:35,280
They're on guard

1255
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:38,560
They're executing an important criminal

1256
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:40,040
So what?

1257
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:43,280
Execute him elsewhere
if they don't want people to see

1258
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,200
What are you doing?

1259
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:48,720
My wife has never seen this

1260
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:50,240
Pardon us!

1261
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:51,400
Have you seen this?

1262
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:54,240
No, I haven't

1263
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:58,120
Can I stand here?

1264
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:00,440
Leave them alone

1265
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:03,880
Don't push!

1266
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,280
What are you doing here?

1267
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:08,440
If she can watch, why can't we?

1268
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:25,640
Come back, I'm scared

1269
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:32,800
Move it! Someone came to his rescue!

1270
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:48,920
Minister, someone came to his rescue

1271
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:49,880
Don't wait any longer

1272
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,320
Execute him now!

1273
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:52,440
Yes!

1274
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,800
Execute the prisoner immediately!

1275
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:56,000
Yes, sir!

1276
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:06,760
Brother Mu, we're here for you!

1277
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:28,800
Sis!
Brother!

1278
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:34,880
Master, it's Xu Shi Min

1279
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:43,960
Hack down the flag pole

1280
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:45,080
Yes!

1281
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:07,720
I'll stall these men

1282
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:08,400
Rescue Master Mu

1283
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:09,480
I will

1284
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:26,640
Kid!

1285
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:40,720
You came for me
despite what happened yesterday

1286
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:41,640
I'm grateful

1287
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:43,000
Forget it! Let's get out of here!

1288
01:40:43,080 --> 01:40:43,800
Yes

1289
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:45,200
Where's Brother Hua?

1290
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:52,640
Hurry!

1291
01:40:57,920 --> 01:40:59,360
Shoot them!

1292
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:11,920
I must avenge Brother Hua!

1293
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:13,000
Brother!

1294
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:26,400
Be careful!

1295
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:28,440
I'll take care of the magistrate

1296
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:42,040
Shoot!

1297
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:36,920
You traitor!

1298
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:38,840
Please spare me!

1299
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:54,880
Brother!

1300
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:14,880
Brother!

1301
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:36,800
Miss Feng Ying, watch your brother

1302
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:37,400
I'll take care of this bastard!

1303
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:38,560
Alright!

1304
01:45:25,680 --> 01:45:26,360
Let's go

1305
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:30,240
Go ahead. I'll just be a burden

1306
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:30,840
Brother

1307
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:32,600
Their chief is dead

1308
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:34,640
These men are nothing

1309
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:37,280
The 3 of us can break away

1310
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:38,480
However if there's any delay

1311
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:41,080
More soldiers

1312
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:43,000
will catch up with us

1313
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:45,040
lt'll be tough to get away

1314
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:48,200
We can't leave you

1315
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:50,640
Remember what Brother Hua said last night?

1316
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:52,200
Our lives are insignificant

1317
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:55,000
compared to spreading the news

1318
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:56,720
about Liu Yu's surrender

1319
01:45:56,840 --> 01:45:58,560
Master Xu...

1320
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:01,240
Take care of my sister

1321
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:15,040
Get the horses

1322
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:26,120
Let's go

1323
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:29,440
Take care of her

1324
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:39,040
Master Xu!
