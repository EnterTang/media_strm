我活在战火与鲜血的世界里

当世界沦陷...

6
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,270
我们每个人都从某种意义上损坏了

7
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,420
很难说谁比谁更疯狂

他们又来了
Here they come again.

14
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,820
钻进我脑子里的黑暗物质

我告诉自己...

他们早死了

23
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,630
我能存在于这个不毛之地
So I exist in this wasteland...

24
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:14,570
就是因为我仅存的本能：
A man, reduced to a single instinct:

25
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,380
生存

她离开了车道
She's gone off road...

93
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,070
开向了敌人的地盘
into hostile territory.

94
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,290
为什么她要这么做？

141
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,360
不但了抽我的血
They have my blood.
还抢走我的车！
Now it's my car!

142
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,400
不朽！
Immortan!

143
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,160
不死老乔！
Immortan Joe!

144
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,380
他看了我一眼！
He looked at me!

145
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,930
他看了我一眼！
He looked right at me!
他看的是你的血包！
He was staring at your Blood Bag!

146
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,610
他回了头！直视着我的眼睛！
He turned his head! He looked
me straight in the eye!!

147
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,910
他只是看着地平线！
He was scanning the horizon!

148
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,400
不
No.

149
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,950
我期待着！

150
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,560
我期待着进入英灵殿！
I am awaited in Valhalla!!!!

151
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,050

156
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:30,140
我看到从大本营里出来的车辆 他们发射了信号弹
We got vehicles from the Citadel. They're firing flares.

157
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:33,530
看起来他们要给汽油镇和子弹农场增员
They want reinforcements from Gas Town and the Bullet Farm.

158
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,930
怎么回事？
What is this??

159
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,180
支援？诱饵？
Backup? Decoy??

160
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,170
这是个迂回
It's a detour.

161
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,410
那辆武装车想对我们做什么？
What's this War Rig doing on our patch!?

162
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,910
作死 但是随时欢迎
Foolish...but welcome

我们是不是该掉头和后援会和？
Should we turn around and
run 'em into our backup?

167
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,550
不需要！我们可以做到
No! We're good.

168
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,500
我们会击败他们！

169
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,070
全速前进！我们走！

She's ours Slit! She's ours!!

175

First, we get the buzzards off her back!

176
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,410
准备投掷！
Ready to throw!

177
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,570
那可是我的脑袋！
That's my head!!!

178
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,750
振作起来！你能做到的！

我们在下面没法呼吸了！

00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,130
他不过是个快死的孩子！
He just a kid at the end of his half-life!!

284
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:53,270
不！我活过 我死了 但我又重生了！
No! I live,
I die, I live again!!

285
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:55,500
控制住他！把他捆起来！
Hold him! I Tie him up!

286
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:56,800
把他扔出去！

287
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,210
扔出去！
Throw him!

288
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:01,070
你们有伴了
You got more friends.

289
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,820
子弹农夫
Bullet Farmer.

290
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,260
他们从子弹农场来的
They're coming from the Bullet Farm.

Yeah?

291
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:10,060
一切都结束了 你打不过他们！
It's over. You can't defy him!

292

293
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:14,770

他那么狡猾地耍了你！
Look how slick he's fooled you War Boy!

294
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:16,090
他是个将死之人
He's a lying old man.

295
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:17,860
在他的领导下我们都会崛起的！
By his hand we'll all be lifted up!

296
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:20,330
这就是为什么我们身上会有他的纹身！
That's why we have his logo seared on our backs!

297
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:22,480
“种畜！”
"Breeding stock!"
“战争炮灰！”
"Battle fodder!"

298
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:23,710
不 荣耀在等待着我！
No, I am awaited!!

299
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:25,510
你只是个将死之人的炮灰
You're an old man's battle fodder.

300
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:27,160
要做的就是除掉一切生灵！
Killing everyone and everything!!

301
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:28,260
我们没有责任
We are not to blame.

302
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,910
那是谁毁掉了世界？！
Then who killed the world?!!

303
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:00,110
我在前面有个交易
I made a deal up ahead.
Safe passage.

304
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:02,480
不知道交易能不能成功
I don't know if it's still any good.

305
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:04,600
大家都回到通道里
Get back in the hold.

306
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:06,010
别关门
Keep the hatch open.

307
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:14,360
我要你待在这里
I need you here.

308
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:18,370
你可能要驾驶这辆卡车

312
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:35,060
不论你做什么，都不要探头
Whatever you do, you can't be seen.

313
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,160
我答应过我一个人去...
I'm supposed to be alone.

314
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:38,940
完成这笔交易
That was the deal.

315
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:46,830

你叫什么？
What's your name?

318
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:14,100
我要怎么称呼你？
What do I call you?

319
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,230
这重要吗？
Does it matter?

320
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:19,610
好吧
Fine.

321
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:21,460
待会我大喊“智障”
When I yell "Fool"...

322
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:23,770
你就马上开车走
you drive outta here
as fast as you can.

323
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,080
这是机关口令：
This is the sequence:

324
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,380
1  1  2
One. One. Two.

3000 gallons of guzzoline, just like you asked!

330
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:12,510

00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:29,430
“可能会有几辆车追你”
"A few vehicles in pursuit.Maybe."

334
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,040
我们数了一共有三个车队！
We count three war parties!!!

335
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:35,450
是啊我真是不走运
Yeah well I got unlucky.

336
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:36,580
让我们开始吧！

用粗齿锯开路！
Open the way for Ripsaw!

340
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:19,730
一旦我们清理了岩石...
Once I'm over...

341
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:22,080
就让大家通过
clear the rocks and lead everyone through.

342
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,100
不朽！

00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:25,610
不死老乔！

00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:25,860
他根本不知道他在说什么！
He doesn't know what he's talking about!

399
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,440
无论发生什么，我们都要去绿洲！
Whatever happens, we're going to the Green Place!

400
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:31,000

405
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:30,210
他会原谅我们 我知道他会的

已经没有回头路了！
There's no going back!

407

408
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:36,690

We were protected! He gave us a life of luxury!

409
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:38,610
这有什么错？         我们不是他的奴隶！
What's wrong with that?    We are not things!!

410
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,680

Cheedo 我们不是他的奴隶！
Cheedo, we are not things!

412
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:46,180
我们不是他的奴隶       我不想在听到这句话了！
We are not THINGS.   I don't want to hear that again!

413
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:47,570
她就是这么教我们的！
They were her words!

414
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:48,980
但她现在死了！
And now she's dead!

415
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:53,450
无论你怎么抓狂 你都不能回去
Wring your hands and tear your hair,
but you're not going back there.

416
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:55,470
你不能回去找他
You're not going back to him.

417
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,100
Angharad!

01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:58,680

421
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:14,900
到底在什么地方？
this Green Place?

422
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:18,220
航向向东 走一夜的路程
It's a long night's run, heading east.

423
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:22,010
我们需要清点一下
We need inventory.

424
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,470
我要你检查所有的枪支弹药
I want you to match every
gun with it's bullets.

425
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:30,240

I'm gonna go down and do some repairs.

426
01:01:30,330 --> 01:01:31,750
我们需要有人在后面望风
We need someone down the back.

427
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:32,920
我去
I'll go.

428
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:33,780
不行
No.

429
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,540
我要你和大家待在这里
I want you to stay together.

430
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:37,500
我能做到的
I can do it.

431
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:11,760
你在这干什么？
What are you doing here?

432
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:14,500
我看到了
He saw it.

433
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:16,570
我全都看到了
He saw it all.

434
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:20,380
我的血包开车碾死了老乔的母种
My own blood bag driving
the rig that killed her.

435
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:29,480
别这样了
Stop doing that.

436
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:34,180
停下来
Stop.

437
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,870
大门三次为我敞开 我却失去了所有机会
Three times the gates were open to me.

438
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:48,460
什么大门
What gates?

439
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,680
英灵殿的大门在等着我
I was awaited in Valhalla.

440
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:52,660
它在呼唤我的名字
They were calling my name.

441
01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:57,060
我可以跟英灵们同行 与先烈们共餐
I should be walking with the Immortan.
Feasting with the heroes of all time.

442
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,570
我想这不是你的命运
I'd say it was your
manifest destiny not to.

443
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:08,010
我觉得我是在为更大的荣誉做准备
I thought I was being spared for something great.

444
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:11,670
我开着追捕车的时候...
I got to... drive a pursuit vehicle.

445
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:15,750
甚至有一段时间Larry和Barry都停止了侵蚀
For a while even Larry and Barry
stop chewing on my windpipe.

446
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:17,500
Larry和Barry是谁？
Who're Larry and Barry?

447
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:19,930
我的肿瘤
My mates.

448
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:21,710
Larry和Barry
Larry and Barry.

449
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:26,240
但就算他们没有侵蚀我，我也会高烧折磨
If they don't get me, the Night Fevers will.

450
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:55,640
这把步枪只剩4发子弹了 所以我觉得已经没什么用了
We only got four for big boy here,
so he's all but useless.

451
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:57,300
不过...
But...

452
01:03:57,530 --> 01:04:01,260
我们的这把小手枪还可以射29次
we can squirt off this little pinky
about 29 times.

453
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:05,980
Angharad曾经叫它反叛之种
Angharad used to call it Anti-seed.

454
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,160
埋下一颗就一定会死
Plant one and watch the thing die.

455
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:47,440
我们耗费了3000加仑的汽油...
We are down 30000 units of gasoline...

456
01:05:47,630 --> 01:05:49,750
19罐硝基...
19 canisters of nitro...

457
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:51,280
12辆摩托车...
12 assault bikes...

458
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:53,060
7辆追捕车
7 pursuit vehicles.

459
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:54,550
全都白搭了
My deficit mounts.

460
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:55,780
然而现在...
And now, sir...

461
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:58,930
你又让我们陷入了困境！
you, have us stuck in a quagmire!

462
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:00,620
老乔！
Hey Joe!

463
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:02,700
老大
Boss!

464
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:06,840
你的妻子快不行了！
Your girl is breathing her last!

465
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:09,580
那孩子呢？
What about the child?

466
01:06:18,770 --> 01:06:20,180
你们还走不走？！
Are you coming Brother?!

467
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:21,510
等下！
Wait!

468
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:24,390
孩子也没声了
It's gone awful quiet in there.

469
01:06:24,530 --> 01:06:25,790
剖出来！
Take it out!

470
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:27,190
把它取出来！
Get it Out!!!

471
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:32,290
快点！我不想等了！
Come on! I've been called to the torture!

472
01:06:33,010 --> 01:06:34,100
耐心点！
Patience!

473
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:38,210
噢你在这慢慢悲伤吧！
Oh you stay here with your grief daddy!

474
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:41,810
我要去找她了
I'll fetch 'em for ya.
小心点！别伤了老乔的宝贝！
Be careful! Protect the assets!!

475
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:46,610
只需要一颗子弹...
Just one angry shot!...

476
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:49,330
就能要了她的命！
for Furiosa.

477
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:50,330
冲啊！
Hut!

478
01:06:57,730 --> 01:06:59,130
真可惜啊
Crying shame.

479
01:07:02,630 --> 01:07:03,630
要是再等一个月...
Another month...

480
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:06,200
可能就是个健康的孩子！
could've been a viable human!

481
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:07,760
是男孩吗？
Was it a male?

482
01:07:08,270 --> 01:07:09,580
是个一流的继承人
A-One Alpha Prime.

483
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:14,040
嘿 Rictus！
Hey Rictus!

484
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:16,980
你失去了一个弟弟！
You lost a baby brother!

485
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:21,300
相当的完美
Perfect in every way.

486
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:25,760
我有过一个弟弟了！
I had a baby brother!!

487
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:28,130
我有过一个小弟弟！
I had a little baby brother!!!

488
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:30,080
他很完美！
And he was perfect!!

489
01:07:30,510 --> 01:07:32,090
相当相当的完美！！
Perfect in every way!!!

490
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:04,110
来吧
Come on.

491
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:14,570
老大 你别打到那些娘们了
You wouldn't wanna shoot the wives sir.

492
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:15,940
我只是看看她们的反应
Just prove it

493
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:28,640
他想要帮忙！
He wants to help!

494
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:30,480
谁？
Who?!

495
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,000
那个战争之子！
The War Boy!!

496
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:35,400
他从哪来的？！
Where did he come from?!
我们不是把他推下车了吗！
I thought we threw him off the rig!!

497
01:08:39,730 --> 01:08:41,690
我把车开到前面的高地去！
There is high ground, just beyond that thing!

498
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:42,920
他是说那棵树
He means the tree.

499
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:46,160
是的！那棵树！
Yeah. Tree!

500
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:47,160
把他交给我吧！
Leave him to me!

501
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:50,730
你们有人看到光亮吗？ 那是在交火吗？
Say, anyone notice that bright light?
Approaching gunfire?

502
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:53,590
滚下来
Get out.
我可以帮忙 我了解这辆车
I can do this. I know this machine.

503
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:55,230
没错 他是个老司机
He does. He's a Revhead.

504
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:02,080
你只剩两发子弹了！
You got two left!

505
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:09,480
看住他
On him.

506
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:28,640
屏住气
Don't breathe.

507
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:34,490
嘿！嘿！嘿！！
Hey! Hey!! Hey!!!

508
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:36,100
战争男孩！
War Boy!!

509
01:09:36,430 --> 01:09:38,850
我去用绞盘缠住树！
I'll use the winch! Around the tree thing.

510
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:40,960
拿着这个
Take this.

511
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:42,870
我们去引擎那
Let's get the engine plates.

512
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:45,500
你去开车！
You drive the rig!

513
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,320
拿火炬！
Hold the flare!
我已经拿着了！
I am holding the flare!!

514
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:50,260
再近一点！
Closer!
已经在您眼前了！
It's right in front of your eyes!!

515
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:04,530
冲！冲啊！
Hut! HUTTT!!!!

516
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:12,010
血包！
Blood Bag!

517
01:10:18,690 --> 01:10:20,820
我是正义的使者！
I am the scales of justice!

518
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:23,680
掌控生死的指挥家！
Conductor of the choir of death!

519
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:29,770
开火！！
Sing for the flock!!

520
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:36,340
开枪！开他妈的枪！
Sing Brother! Sing!! SINGGGG!!!!

521
01:10:37,290 --> 01:10:39,400
难道他们不知道在朝我们开枪吗？！
Don't they know they're shooting at us?!

522
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:54,650
换弹！
Guns reload!!!

523
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:07,190
我从没想过我能做这种不平凡的事情！
I never thought I would do
something as shiny as that!

524
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:09,020
引擎怎么了？
How're the engines?

525
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:11,360
又热又渴
Very hot and real thirsty.

526
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:20,470
嘿 你再继续往前开半公里
Hey. You need to take the rig
half a click down the track.

527
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,930
如果引擎冷却你还没回来怎么办？
What if you're not back
by the time the engines are cooled?

528
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,030
那你们就继续前进
Well you keep moving!

529
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:39,440
你觉得他会怎么做？
What do you suppose he's gonna do?

530
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:42,080
以牙还牙
Retaliate first.

531
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:46,880
我们出发！
Let's go!

532
01:14:06,530 --> 01:14:07,580
你受伤了吗？
Are you hurt?

533
01:14:09,370 --> 01:14:10,370
你在流血
You're bleeding.

534
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:12,680
那不是他的血
That's not his blood.

535
01:14:14,510 --> 01:14:15,510
这是什么
What is this?

536
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:17,780
那是人奶
It's Mother's Milk.

537
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:01,600
没事的
It's okay.

538
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:03,120
睡吧
Sleep.

539
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:05,460
好好休息一下
Get some rest.

540
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:18,450
你这么知道那有绿洲？
How do you know this place even exists?

541
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:22,610
我出生在那里
I was born there.

542
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:26,080
那为什么离开了？
Why'd you leave?

543
01:15:26,570 --> 01:15:27,600
我没有离开
I didn't.

544
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:31,020
我是被掳走的
I was taken as a child.

545
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:33,980
被偷走的
Stolen.

546
01:15:40,190 --> 01:15:41,630
这种事你之前做过吗？
You've done this before?

547
01:15:42,470 --> 01:15:44,080
很多次了
Many times.

548
01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:46,820
我能够驾驶这辆车...
Now that I drive a War Rig...

549
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:50,940
是我前所未有的好机会
this is the best shot I'll ever have.

550
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,140
她们呢？
And them?

551
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:56,690
她们在寻求希望
They are looking for hope.

552
01:15:57,750 --> 01:15:58,770
那你呢？
What about you?

553
01:16:04,430 --> 01:16:05,870
救赎
Redemption.

554
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:51,640
嘿 那是什么？
Hey. What's that?

555
01:17:04,210 --> 01:17:06,680
我以前见过那个东西
I remember something like that.

556
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:19,960
救我！
Help me!

557
01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:24,560
救救我！
HELP ME!!!!

558
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:29,620
求你了 救救我！
Please, help me!

559
01:17:29,870 --> 01:17:30,960
求你了！
Please!

560
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:32,950
那是个诱饵
That's bait.

561
01:17:34,470 --> 01:17:35,680
待在车里
Stay in the Rig.

562
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:43,840
快！求你了 快点！ 他们要回来了！
Hurry! Please, hurry up! They will be back!

563
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:47,390
我是Vuvalini中的一员
I'm one of the Vuvalini!

564
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:50,440
有众多的母亲
From the Many Mothers!

565
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:55,090
我的启蒙母亲叫作 Katie Concannon
My initiate mother was Katie Concannon!

566
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,890
我是Mary Jo Bassa的女儿
I am the daughter of Mary Jo Bassa.

567
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:02,820
我的家族是襁褓之犬
My clan was Swaddle Dog!

568
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:51,490
是我
It's me.

569
01:18:59,650 --> 01:19:01,440
看你的那双眼眸
There's something in the eyes.

570
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,770
也许是Jo Bassa'的女儿
Perhaps she is Jo Bassa's child.

571
01:19:09,190 --> 01:19:10,940
这是我们的Furiosa
This is our Furiosa.

572
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:14,850
已经过去多久了？
How long has it been?

573
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:17,780
7000个日夜了
Seven thousand days.

574
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:20,320
还有一些已经忘却的日子
Plus the ones I don't remember.

575
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:23,090
Furiosa.

576
01:19:24,410 --> 01:19:26,030
你的妈妈怎么了？
What happened to your mother?

577
01:19:27,580 --> 01:19:28,800
她去世了
She died.

578
01:19:29,770 --> 01:19:31,140
在我出生的第三天
On the 3rd day.

579
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:39,450
你从哪里来的？
From where did you come?

580
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:43,690
西方 山后的要塞
The West. Citadel. Beyond the mountains.

581
01:19:48,190 --> 01:19:50,010
那两个男的 他们是谁？
The men. Who are they?

582
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:51,730
他们是可以信赖的人
They're reliable.

583
01:19:52,110 --> 01:19:53,600
多亏了他们我们才能到这里
They helped us get here.

584
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:07,700
你们哪找的这种衣服？
Where did you find such creatures?

585
01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:11,470
真柔软
So soft.

586
01:20:12,410 --> 01:20:14,670
真是一口好牙！
This one has all her teeth!

587
01:20:23,010 --> 01:20:24,820
我等不急想让他们瞧瞧了
I can't wait for them to see it.

588
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:26,780
瞧？
See?

589
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:29,080
瞧什么？
See what?

590
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:30,760
家啊
Home.

591
01:20:34,890 --> 01:20:36,140
那片绿洲
The Green Place.

592
01:20:36,390 --> 01:20:38,530
如果你们是从西方来的...
But if you came from the West...

593
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:41,140
那你们已经路过了
you passed it.

594
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:43,880
那片...
The crows.

595
01:20:44,270 --> 01:20:46,590
那片乌鸦横飞的恐怖之地
The creepy place with all the crows.

596
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:49,300
土地被污染后 我们不得不搬出去
The soil. I We had to get out.

597
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,330
我们没有水
We had no water.
水也是被污染的
And water was filth.

598
01:20:51,470 --> 01:20:53,120
都是酸臭的
It was sour.

599
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:54,670
然后乌鸦就来了
Then the crows came.

600
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:56,630
我们什么也种不了
We couldn't grow anything.

601
01:20:56,990 --> 01:20:58,260
那其他人呢？
Where are the others?

602
01:20:58,620 --> 01:20:59,620
什么人？
What others?

603
01:20:59,670 --> 01:21:00,700
其他的母亲呢？
The Many Mothers.

604
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:04,460
我们是唯一剩下来的
We're the only ones left.

605
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,200
看
Look.

606
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:09,550
那就是你们所谓的人造卫星
That's what you'd call a satellite.

607
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:12,450
Miss Giddy曾经跟我们说过
Miss Giddy told us about those.

608
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:15,940
它最初是给整个地球发收信号的
They used to bounce messages
across the Earth.

609
01:22:16,730 --> 01:22:20,900
电视节目 曾经人人都爱看的电视节目
Shows. Everyone in the old world
had a show.

610
01:22:23,330 --> 01:22:25,620
你觉得在那里还会有人吗？
Do you think there's still
somebody out there?

611
01:22:26,710 --> 01:22:28,180
在那发送信号？
Sending shows?

612
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:30,860
谁知道呢
Who knows?

613
01:22:31,310 --> 01:22:33,090
都是一片死寂
Those are the Plains of Silence.

614
01:22:36,150 --> 01:22:40,430
好好呆在里面吧小乔 我好像已经失去了新奇感
Stay right where you are little Joey.
Kinda lost it's novelty out here.

615
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:42,150
你怀孕了？
You having a baby?

616
01:22:43,210 --> 01:22:44,600
是啊
Warlord Junior.

617
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:46,140
肯定是个丑陋的小暴君
Gonna be so ugly.

618
01:22:46,910 --> 01:22:48,330
说不定是个女孩呢
It could be a girl.

619
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:51,710
你用那个杀过很多人吧
You killed people with that do ya?

620
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:54,090
我杀死了我在这里遇到的所有人
Killed everyone I met out here.

621
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:56,700
爆头的 穿颈的 应有尽有
Headshots. All. Snap! Right in the medulla.

622
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:58,890
我以为你还会女人一点
I thought you girls were above all that.

623
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:04,540
过来
Come here.

624
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:13,540
挑个看看
Take a peek in.

625
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,600
种子！
Seeds!

626
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:18,130
这是从家乡带来的家产
These are from home.

627
01:23:18,190 --> 01:23:20,480
真正的 有机种子！
Heirlooms. The real thing!

628
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:22,920
我一直在试着播种
I plant one every chance I get.

629
01:23:23,450 --> 01:23:24,450
在哪？
Where?

630
01:23:24,530 --> 01:23:27,390
到现在 没有存活的 土地都酸化了
So far nothings took. Earth's too sour.

631
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:29,600
这有很多种类
Ohh so many different kinds.

632
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:31,750
树木 花卉 水果
Trees, flowers, fruit.

633
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,970
在过去 人人都有这些东西
Back then everyone had their fill!

634
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:37,980
在过去 我们不需要杀死任何人
Back then, there was no need to snap anybody!

635
01:23:53,890 --> 01:23:55,410
我能和你谈谈吗？
Can I talk to you?

636
01:24:14,770 --> 01:24:16,430
我已经和其他人谈过了
I've talked with the others.

637
01:24:23,420 --> 01:24:26,540
现在是跨越沙漠的最好机会
We're never going to have a better chance
to make it across the salt.

638
01:24:28,790 --> 01:24:32,890
如果我们把卡车留在这 骑上摩托满载出发...
If we leave the rig here, and load the
motorcycles up with as much as we can...

639
01:24:33,030 --> 01:24:35,340
我们至少能够开个160天
we can be able to ride for 160 days.

640
01:24:38,390 --> 01:24:40,160
我们给你留了一辆
One of those bikes is yours.

641
01:24:41,390 --> 01:24:42,600
加满了油
Fully loaded.

642
01:24:45,370 --> 01:24:47,880
非常欢迎你加入我们
You're more than welcome to come with us.

643
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:53,710
不..不 我会自己走的
N..No, I make my own way.

644
01:25:00,570 --> 01:25:02,150
你知道吗 抱着希望本身就是个错误
You know, hope is a mistake.

645
01:25:09,430 --> 01:25:12,120
如果你没法改变现状...
If you can't fix what's broken, you'll...

646
01:25:14,770 --> 01:25:16,240
你就只能被现实打败
You'll go insane.

647
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:34,050
你在哪 Max？
Where are you, Max?

648
01:25:36,310 --> 01:25:37,360
你在哪？
Where are you?

649
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:41,080
救救我们  你答应过会救我们的
Help us. You promised to help us.

650
01:25:51,610 --> 01:25:53,710
爸爸快过来！我们走！
Come on Pa! Let's go!

651
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:26,920
听好了
Alright.

652
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:30,220
这里 才是你的家
THIS, is your way home.

653
01:26:33,820 --> 01:26:34,900
我们要回去？
We go back?

654
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:38,860
回去？  没错
Back?   Yeah.

655
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:40,880
我以为你已经恢复正常了
I thought you weren't insane anymore.

656
01:26:40,970 --> 01:26:42,320
他怎么说的？
What are they saying?

657
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:44,750
他想回到我们离开的地方
He wants to go back from where they came.

658
01:26:45,020 --> 01:26:46,020
要塞
The Citadel.

659
01:26:47,070 --> 01:26:48,580
要塞里面有什么？
What's there to find at the Citadel??

660
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:50,210
绿洲
Green.

661
01:26:50,740 --> 01:26:52,060
还有水！
And water!

662
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:57,100
那里有取之不尽的水和粮食
There is a ridiculous amounts of
clear water. And a lot of crops.

663
01:26:57,130 --> 01:26:59,310
那里什么都有 只要你不恐高
It's got everything you need.
As long as you're not afraid of heights.

664
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:01,190
那些水是从哪来的？
Where does the water come from?

665
01:27:01,230 --> 01:27:02,910
老乔从深层的地下打出来的
He pumps it out from deep under the earth.

666
01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:05,230
他控制了他所谓的“纯净之水”
Calls it ‘Aqua Cola',
and claims it all for himself.

667
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:07,810
并因此来统治一切
And because he owns it,
he owns all of us.

668
01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:09,100
我已经开始讨厌他了
I don't like him already.

669
01:27:09,250 --> 01:27:11,640
穿过山脉得花我们两周的时间
It'll take two weeks just to
scale a wall of mountains.

670
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:13,020
不需要
No.

671
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:15,600
我建议直接原路返回
I suggest we go back the same way we came.

672
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:18,810
穿过峡谷
Through the canyon.

673
01:27:20,230 --> 01:27:23,930
那里应该已经被打通了不是么？ 他的那些人就是从那边通过的
It's open. We know that. Right?
He brought all his war parties through!

674
01:27:24,470 --> 01:27:27,890
所以我们得用武装卡车穿过他们之中
So, we take the War Rig and we charge
it right through the middle of 'em.

675
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:30,530
可以在路上倒上汽油...
We can decouple the tank at the pass...

676
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:32,380
断了他们的后路
shut it off behind us.

677
01:27:32,670 --> 01:27:33,670
Ka-Boom!!

678
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:39,130
那到底我们要怎样拿下要塞呢？
And how exactly do we take the Citadel?

679
01:27:39,790 --> 01:27:41,450
假设那时我们还活着
Assuming we're still alive by then?

680
01:27:41,850 --> 01:27:44,360
如果我们能够阻断道路，那就会变得很容易
If we can block the pass, it'll be easy.

681
01:27:44,670 --> 01:27:48,170
剩下的就只是些老弱病残的了
All that's left are his War Pups,
and War Boys too sick to fight.

682
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:50,750
我们可以跟着Nux
And we'll be with Nux.

683
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:52,600
他是个战争之子
He's a War Boy.

684
01:27:52,650 --> 01:27:53,690
押我们回去也是合情合理
He'll be bringing us home.

685
01:27:53,930 --> 01:27:55,770
他的职责就是带回被偷走的东西
Bringing back what's
stolen, as he's meant to.

686
01:27:59,150 --> 01:28:00,150
没错
Yeah.

687
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:02,650
听起来挺有希望的
Feels like hope.

688
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:06,910
我喜欢这个计划 我们可以重新开始！
I like this plan. We can start again!

689
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:09,230
就像过去的那些日子！
Just like the old days!

690
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:12,120
听着
Look.

691
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:14,680
这将会是艰难的一天
It will be a hard day.

692
01:28:15,170 --> 01:28:18,040
但我敢保证 你再往前走个160天...
But I guarantee you 160 days riding that way...

693
01:28:20,540 --> 01:28:22,390
见到的还是沙子
there's nothing but.

694
01:28:24,990 --> 01:28:27,700
如果我们原路杀回去 至少我们可以...
At least that way, y'know
we might be able to...

695
01:28:29,330 --> 01:28:31,470
一起...
together...

696
01:28:32,210 --> 01:28:34,170
得到某种所谓的救赎
come across some kind of redemption.

697
01:29:04,930 --> 01:29:06,010
武装车！
War Rig!

698
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:08,320
那是她的武装卡车！
It's the War Rig!

699
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:19,560
是他们没错
That's them.

700
01:29:19,930 --> 01:29:21,220
为什么他们回来了？
Why're they going back?

701
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:23,270
他们是想投降吗？
Do they wish to surrender?

702
01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:25,580
他们开向了峡谷
They're heading for the canyon.

703
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:30,270
他们是要回去！ 回大本营！
They're going back, to the Citadel!!!

704
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:32,270
他们知道那里是毫无防备的！
They know it's undefended!!

705
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:33,520
混蛋！
Bollocks!

706
01:30:09,710 --> 01:30:10,500
你在做什么？         祈祷
What are you doing?    Praying.

707
01:30:11,630 --> 01:30:12,730
向谁祈祷？
To whom?

708
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:14,280
随便哪个神仙
Anyone that's listening.

709
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:39,890
做好准备姐妹们！
