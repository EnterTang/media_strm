00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.000
Episode 3

4
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.000
Brother Fatty! Brother Hu!

5
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Ying Zi! Ying Zi, are you down here?

6
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.000
Brother Hu, I'm down here!

7
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.000
Are you okay?

8
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.000
I'm fine. I twisted my leg, and I can't climb up.

9
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.000
- Fatty.- What?

10
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Do you think this is the side entrance that they dug?

11
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.000
- Go get the tools.- Okay.

12
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.000
- Don't forget the rope!- Okay.

13
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.000
Ying Zi, don't be afraid. We'll go save you soon!

14
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.000
Okay.

15
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.000
What's down there?

16
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.000
It's too dark down here. I can't see clearly.

17
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.000
Brother Hu, be careful.

18
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.000
Are you alright?

19
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.000
I'm fine. I twisted my leg.

20
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Let me see.

21
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.000
Can you move on your own? Try moving it.

22
00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.000
You're fine. If you can move your bone, you're fine.

23
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.000
Move out of the way! Master Fatty coming through!

24
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.000
Hey, be careful.

25
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Who told you to come? I asked you to stay up there and keep guard.

26
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.000
There's nothing up there. What's there to guard?

27
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
- Ying Zi, are you okay?- I'm fine.

28
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.000
- Are you okay?- I'm okay.

29
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.000
Wow, this is so magical.

30
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.000
This is exhilarating.

31
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.000
Old Hu.

32
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.000
- Is this a tomb?- It really is a tomb.

33
00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.000
Old Hu.

34
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Ying Zi, take this.

35
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.000
What is it?

36
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Hoof of a black donkey. It's to ward off spirits.

37
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.000
I got it from the village chief. I even have glutinous rice.

38
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Aren't you just impressive?

39
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.000
Did you put this on?

40
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.000
Of course. Hide it.

41
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
That's more like it. Since we're already here, let's explore.

42
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Stand back.

43
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.000
Brother Fatty, what are you doing?

44
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.000
Seeing if there's a trap,

45
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.000
just in case they start firing arrows,and we become kebabs.

46
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.000
Brother Fatty, you know so much.

47
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.000
Of course. Your Brother Fatty was studying the whole trip, and now his knowledge is coming into use.

48
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.000
Fatty, that's enough.

49
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Somebody has already traveled down this path. There shouldn't be any traps.

50
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Better safe than sorry.

51
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Brother Hu, are we really going in?

52
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Are you afraid? We'll leave after checking it out.

53
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.000
Outside, you protect us two. In here, we'll protect you.

54
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.000
Come on. You can walk, right?

55
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.000
Looks like people really have been here before.

56
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Is this the coffin?

57
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.000
Don't be afraid. It's a mural. There are murals all around.

58
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.000
- That scared me.- Put this up.

59
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.000
This should be the owner of the coffin.

60
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.000
This picture shows the scene of fighting on the battle field.

61
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.000
Watch your step.

62
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.000
This should be the image of triumphant victory.

63
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.000
Let's go look over there.

64
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.000
This is the arrival of calamity.

65
00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.000
And here.

66
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.000
This should be his rank promotion.

67
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.000
Judging by these images, the personin the coffin was a general.

68
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.000
Old Hu, Old Hu! Come here.

69
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Let's go.

70
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.000
Old Hu, look.

71
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.000
Don't touch it.

72
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
I didn't touch it. It fell on its own.

73
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.000
This general was rather poor.

74
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.000
His grave goods are either scrap metals or broken vases.

75
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.000
What is this?

76
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.000
A dinosaur.

77
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.000
What dinosaur? Why don't you talk about Kong Rong sharing his pears, instead? (&quot;dinosaur&quot; sounds similar to &quot;Kong Rong&quot;)

78
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.000
This is a battle horse for the general's grave good. Understand?

79
00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:59.000
Why is there not a coffin here?

80
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.000
Do you think the tomb raiders took the coffin away?

81
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Are you stupid? The entrance was so small. They couldn't have carried it through.

82
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.000
Mace?

83
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.000
Where do you think the coffin is hidden?

84
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.000
There's definitely a hidden trapdoor.

85
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.000
Brother Hu, I'm afraid. Let's hurry and leave.

86
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.000
Ying Zi, don't be scared, okay?

87
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.000
If the sky falls, Brother Hu will hold it up for you. Don't be scared.

88
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Fatty, come here.

89
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.000
Look. I think there's a problem with this.

90
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.000
Could this be a switch?

91
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.000
It really can move.

92
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.000
I saw!

93
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.000
Old Hu, there's another one here.

94
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.000
Don't touch it!

95
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Brother Hu, what's going on?

96
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.000
What's that sound?

97
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.000
Duck!

98
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.000
Fatty, are you okay?

99
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.000
I'm fine. Are you okay?

100
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.000
Hurry and leave. Hurry!

101
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.000
Hurry.

102
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Old Hu!

103
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.000
I hit my leg.

104
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.000
Hurry and leave.

105
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.000
So the secret mechanism is here.

106
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.000
The good things are definitely inside here!

107
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.000
- What are you doing?- Don't touch it.

108
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.000
It's right in front of you! Don't you want to see what's inside?

109
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.000
Hold this.

110
00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:49.000
Timing and Subtitles brought to you by 中剧独播

111
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.000
- Candle.- Okay.

112
00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.000
Fire.

113
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:18.000
Brother Hu, what are you doing?

114
00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:19.000
When humans light candles,

115
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.000
the ghosts blow them out.

116
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:24.000
What?

117
00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:35.000
This is a rule left behind by earlier generations.

118
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:39.000
It means, first light a candle on the southeast corner of the coffin before opening it.

119
00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:42.000
If the candle goes out, you must quickly leave

120
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.000
and mustn't take a single object.

121
00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.000
This is a promise between the dead and the alive.

122
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.000
It's been passed on for thousands of years and cannot be broken.

123
00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.000
Look at this.

124
00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:01.000
Look at the imposing appearance, the artistry, the carvings.

125
00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:03.000
I think this general was a soldier his whole life.

126
00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:05.000
Only his coffin was worth some money.

127
00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:08.000
Enough of that. Close your big mouth.

128
00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:12.000
Practice is the only criteria for testing the truth. At the least,

129
00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.000
there should be a sword here. Right?

130
00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.000
Let's open it and see!

131
00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:16.000
Bring it over.

132
00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.000
Ying Zi, help me shine the light.

133
00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.000
Didn't we agree to leave?

134
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.000
Hold the flashlight.

135
00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.000
- Fatty.- Yes?

136
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:42.000
You go to the back.

137
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.000
I finished.

138
00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:59.000
Wait.

139
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.000
You go watch the candle.

140
00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.000
One, two, three!

141
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:31.000
I already told you he was very poor.

142
00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:33.000
Let's look first.

143
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:44.000
You scared me!

144
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.000
This...

145
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:58.000
We were just curious

146
00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:01.000
and accidentally entered this place. We need to borrow

147
00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:02.000
some of your garments.

148
00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.000
I'm sorry. Please don't blame us.

149
00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:09.000
In the future, we'll surely use the money for the common good and improve life for all.

150
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
I will definitely learn from Lei Feng and do good deeds.

151
00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:14.000
I'll differentiate love from hate. I won't forget my origins. I'll stand firm and keep my fighting spirit strong--

152
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.000
Enough.

153
00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.000
Fatty,

154
00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.000
even if we find anything, don't think of taking it.

155
00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.000
If something really happens, I can't save you.

156
00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:25.000
Don't joke around!

157
00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:28.000
Where did those valuable items from Panjiayuan come from?

158
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:31.000
Where did Big Gold Tooth get his things?

159
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.000
I just want to look.

160
00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:38.000
You can rest first. Go rest, okay? Hurry, hurry.

161
00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.000
Fatty, be careful.

162
00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:08.000
Old Hu!

163
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:12.000
Hard work pays off. Look at this.

164
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:15.000
Isn't it valuable?

165
00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.000
It's jade!

166
00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:22.000
I think this is valuable.

167
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:25.000
Of course! He was holding it in his hand.

168
00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.000
Of course it's important.

169
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.000
Brother Hu, look.

170
00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:59.000
Can you stop buying such cheap candles?

171
00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:01.000
You bought a cheap candle for such an important task.

172
00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.000
In the future, I'll buy Japanese candles.

173
00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:07.000
I'll buy British candles; I'll buy American candles. I'll buy the most expensive ones,

174
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:10.000
but...

175
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:12.000
Put these two jades back.

176
00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.000
Put them back? Impossible.

177
00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:18.000
What are you thinking? I worked so hard to get these just to put them back?

178
00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.000
That'd be such a waste.

179
00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.000
Fatty, hurry and put it back! The candle went out!

180
00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:28.000
I'm not putting it back! So what? What if the wind blew it out?

181
00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.000
- Will you put it back?- Hey, what are you doing?

182
00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:34.000
Are you going to use your gun for an internal conflict?

183
00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.000
I'm telling you, it's not that I can't beat you.

184
00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:39.000
I just don't want to fight a girl. Don't force me.

185
00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:41.000
- Will you put it back or not?- Ying Zi.

186
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.000
Fatty, this is a rule left by our ancestors.

187
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.000
Nobody can break it. Put it back!

188
00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.000
I can only put one piece back?

189
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:54.000
Fine. Here, give me the lighter.

190
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:58.000
I'll go light the candle again.

191
00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:01.000
If it stays lit, we can take the jade. If it goes out again,

192
00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:03.000
we must return both of them.

193
00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:07.000
Okay, just out of respect for our ancestors.

194
00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:09.000
I'll put one back.

195
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.000
I'm putting it back.

196
00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.000
See? It's fine.

197
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:42.000
Everything's fine.

198
00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:49.000
Do you see that? I have more guts.

199
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.000
Shajiabang Opera, the sixth act. Withdraw.

200
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.000
Let's go.

201
00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:09.000
Wait.

202
00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:12.000
Why is the fire turning green?

203
00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.000
Hurry and leave!

204
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:41.000
How did that thing fly over here?

205
00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.000
We're stuck!

206
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:47.000
Y-Ying Zi,

207
00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.000
all scary things are just paper tigers.

208
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:51.000
Don't be afraid.

209
00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.000
We'll kill it.

210
00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:54.000
We'll kill it.

211
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
- Brother Hu... - Old Hu.

212
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:03.000
Old Hu.

213
00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:05.000
T-Talk it out with him. We'll give the jade back.

214
00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:08.000
Tell him that if we begin fighting, nobody will benefit. Peace is the most important!

215
00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:10.000
Stop talking! Do you think he's a human?

216
00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:12.000
Can he even understand our words?

217
00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:14.000
- What do we do, then?- What else can we do?

218
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.000
The exit's sealed.

219
00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.000
It's obvious that we have to become his grave goods.

220
00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:22.000
We can only fight him.

221
00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:25.000
Ying Zi, hide.

222
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:27.000
Leave this monster to us.

223
00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:37.000
I'll kill you!

224
00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.000
Old Hu! You didn't sacrifice yourself, right?

225
00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:51.000
Shut your unlucky mouth.

226
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.000
I'll kill you!

227
00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:03.000
I'll chop you to death!

228
00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.000
Fatty, get up and run!

229
00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.000
Hurry and run!

230
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:26.000
Fatty!

231
00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.000
Hurry and get up.

232
00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.000
I can't get up.

233
00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:41.000
Nice shot! Keep shooting, Ying Zi!

234
00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.000
Hurry, give the jade to me.

235
00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:04.000
Ying Zi!

236
00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.000
Brother Fatty, save me!

237
00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.000
Move away!

238
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:17.000
Ying Zi, are you okay?

239
00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:20.000
Go!

240
00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:26.000
Here's your jade. We'll give it back.

241
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
I gave it back, okay?

242
00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.000
Hey!

243
00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.000
I already gave it back! Why are you still chasing me?

244
00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:46.000
- Fatty, black donkey hoof!- Hoof.

245
00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.000
Flip over the wall.

246
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:03.000
Ying Zi, shine it on my hand!

247
00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:06.000
Old Hu, go!

248
00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.000
Old Hu, this is useful!

249
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.000
Brother Hu!

250
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000
Keep groaning.

251
00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.000
Brother Hu, are you okay?

252
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000
I'm fine. Are you okay?

253
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.000
- Keep groaning.- Fatty!

254
00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.000
Stop kicking him. You might kick the hoof out.

255
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000
Hurry, hurry. Come over here.

256
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.000
Hurry and find a way to open the exit. We must leave.

257
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Ying Zi, that was a really good shot.

258
00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.000
Otherwise, I would have died here.

259
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
Old Hu, before leaving, I must take the two jade pieces.

260
00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:21.000
- Otherwise, I won't be satisfied.- Stop talking. Come here. Give the shovel to me.

261
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.000
One, two, three.

262
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.000
One, two, three.

263
00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.000
One, two, three.

264
00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.000
Brother Hu,

265
00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.000
I think he moved.

266
00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:54.000
What do we do, Old Hu?

267
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.000
- Run!- Run where?

268
00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.000
- Run to the back!- Okay.

269
00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.000
Hurry. Ying Zi, hurry!

270
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.000
Hurry!

271
00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.000
Let me do it.

272
00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.000
Here, I'll help you.

273
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.000
One, two, go!

274
00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.000
Old Hu, I can't do it!

275
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.000
Why is it so heavy?

276
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.000
He's coming!

277
00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.000
Stop yelling. I heard him.

278
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Fatty, come here!

279
00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.000
Fatty, again!

280
00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.000
Brother Hu.

281
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000
It's a secret room.

282
00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.000
- Fatty, hurry and go in. - Do you think I can fit?

283
00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.000
Don't talk. Hurry and go in!

284
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Ying Zi, hurry.

285
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Hurry, Old Hu!

286
00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.000
Run! Hurry!

287
00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.000
Hurry, hurry.

288
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Wait. Here, close the door.

289
00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:20.000
He's clinging onto us like plaster.

290
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
How do you lock this?

291
00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.000
Here. Shine the light here, Ying Zi.

292
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Hurry, you two!

293
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Where is this?

294
00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:43.000
What place is it? Why is there an iron gate in this tomb?

295
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.000
There's a map here.

296
00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.000
This should be a Japanese underground fortress.

297
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.000
This is the Kwantung Army's secret fortress?

298
00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.000
Old Hu, we came here just for this.

299
00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.000
We almost died in the tomb,

300
00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.000
but we ended up here while trying to escape.

301
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
We didn't make this trip for nothing!

302
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Exits are marked here.

303
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
Hopefully the Japanese didn't destroy them when they surrendered.

304
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:42.000
Old Hu, there's an ammunition warehouse here. Let's go check it out.

305
00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.000
Hopefully there'll be an aircraft cannon,and we can bomb him to death.

306
00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:50.000
Brother Hu, if we can find an exit, let's not mess with the monster.

307
00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:54.000
Don't listen to his nonsense. How can an aircraft be flown underground?

308
00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.000
Can't I satisfy my need to talk?

309
00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:01.000
The power control room's here. Let's go see if the electricity generator still works.

310
00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.000
Here, this way.

311
00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.000
Here.

312
00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.000
Ying Zi, shine the light here.

313
00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.000
Okay, that's enough, Fatty!

314
00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.000
Light has come to the human world!

315
00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:24.000
We're finally not in the dark anymore.

316
00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.000
Brother Hu, let's hurry and find the exit.

317
00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:31.000
Okay, we'll go find some weapons, just in case we run into more demonic creatures.

318
00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.000
Brother Hu,

319
00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.000
would there be a child here?

320
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.000
There are no people here. What child?

321
00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.000
Ying Zi, are you going crazy from the fear?

322
00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.000
Did you see something?

323
00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:55.000
No, maybe the fear really is getting to me.

324
00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.000
Let's go. This way.

325
00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.000
This is such a big fortress.

326
00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.000
Wow,

327
00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:17.000
the Japanese were so wicked.

328
00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.000
Why are so many things here?

329
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.000
Type 92 battalion gun.

330
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Timing and subtitles brought to you by 中剧独播

331
00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.000
Type 92, 7.7mm machine gun.

332
00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:42.000
Hey, if we had this, I would have shot that monster into pieces.

333
00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:45.000
- Fatty.- What?

334
00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.000
Find something to break open this lock.

335
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Coming.

336
00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.000
Move out of the way.

337
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000
What is this?

338
00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.000
Japanese lunch boxes.

339
00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.000
What is this?

340
00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:10.000
Wow!

341
00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.000
This is good stuff. Take off your bag.

342
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Okay.

343
00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:19.000
Ying Zi, hold this.

344
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000
Old Hu, Ying Zi, here!

345
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:41.000
♫ Walk forward and pass through a gap ♫

346
00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:46.000
♫ I want to see it more clearly ♫

347
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:59.000
♫ My courage and fragile sensitivityare together ♫

348
00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:13.000
♫ Some secrets are hidden at the bottom of my heart ♫

349
00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:17.000
♫ I’ve never mentioned it to anybody ♫

350
00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:30.000
♫ Fate beckons, but doesn’t careabout the result ♫

351
00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:34.000
♫ Because of capricious changes,I’m trapped in the moment ♫

352
00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:38.000
♫ An unknown river flows up,but the river current goes down ♫

353
00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:42.000
♫ The bigger your desires,the higher price you must pay ♫

354
00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:46.000
♫ My stomach is filled with words,but I close my mouth ♫

355
00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:50.000
♫ Fate has once given promises,but it can also go back on its words ♫

356
00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:54.000
♫ One side offers loving words,while the other side offers lies ♫

357
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:58.000
♫ You’re supposed to climb to heaven,but you flee to hell ♫

358
00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:03.000
♫ You were given a youthful face,but it transformed all into grey hairs overnight ♫

359
00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:11.000
♫ Sail downstream with the current ♫
