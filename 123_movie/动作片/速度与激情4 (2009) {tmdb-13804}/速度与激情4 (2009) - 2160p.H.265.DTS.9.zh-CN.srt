Everyone in position.

8
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,867
我还以为我们要抢银行
l thought we'd be robbing banks by now,

9
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:19,328
而不是在这前不着村后不着店 的地方抢油罐车
not some gas truck in the middle of nowhere.

10
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,081
在这 石油就是黄金

是啊 可是银行不会乱跑

Anytime you get near a bank...we have to break your ass out of prison.

Hey, you greedy bitch!

Okay, guys, we're gonna have to hit this hard and fast.

Let's see if you can get it under six tries this time, huh, T?

25
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:18,822
说什么呢 这回一次搞定
What are you talking about? I'll do it in one try!

Just one K left. We're running out of road. Get in there, brother.

28
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,139
明白
I got it, I got it.

29
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,608

- Don't be crazy.lose your load! - What do you think I'm trying to do?

我是大号的 伙计

找点乐子去

56
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,728
警察突击了我们在巴拉科阿的修车厂
Cops just raided our garage in Baracoa.

57
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,065
他们要抓的是你
They were real interested in you.

58
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:50,403
我们刚刚又给他们留下了线索
Heat's on and we just sent up a flare that's gonna lead them right to us.

我们明早就离开这
l say we move out first thing in the morning.

60
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,993
不 他们要抓的是我
Nah, it's me they want.

61
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,579
如果他们抓住我
And if they catch me,

62
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,666
他们会把与我有牵连的人都投入大牢
they're throwing big numbers at anybody with me.

63
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,796
韩 我们做得不错
Han, we had a good run.

64
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,551
你该去做些自己的事情了
Time for you to go do your own thing.

65
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:19,474
听说他们在东京很疯狂

67
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,080
她在那
There she is.

我听说里约每年这时候很美

警察追得越来越紧
The cops are getting hungrier.

70
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,222
这就是我们的生活
Then I guess we're doing our job.

71
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,937
我是个移动的目标
I'm a walking target.

72
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:09,816
我不想被抓住的时候让你受牵连
I don't want you around when they catch up to me.

73
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,404
“不开车就去死” 还记得吗？
"Ride or die," remember?

74
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,533
多姆 我们干这行多久了？
Dom, how long have we been doing this?

75
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:24,372
突然之间 凭空就说这很危险了？
And now all of a sudden, out of nowhere, it's too dangerous?

76
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,541
好啦
Come on.

77
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:34,633
我们能化险为夷的 一向如此
We'll figure it out. We always do.

83
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:20,817
感谢上帝 听着 他没发火因为昨天他偷懒没锻炼
Thank God. Listen, he's in a mood because yesterday was his cheat day,

84
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,861
今天 有人拿来了甜甜圈
and then today, some genius brought in donuts.

85
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,153
很好
Great.

86
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,073
对不起来晚了
Sorry I'm late.

87
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:32,704
你在市区闹运之后就投诉不断

88
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,957

Tell me that reinstating you wasn't a mistake.

- I got a name. David Park. - That's it?

就听到个大卫・帕克？
That's all you got? David Park?

91

从这窗户扔出去块点心 能砸到50个大卫・帕克
I could throw a fortune cookie out this window and hit 50 David Parks right now.

92
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,468
- 是韩国人 不是中国人 - 随便
- It's Korean, not Chinese. - Whatever.

93
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:52,724
帕克召集街头车手给布拉加运货
Park is a scout that recruits street racers to be mules for the Braga cartel.

94
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,393

00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:24,464
米娅 我说过不要打到这里来
Mia, I told you not to call me here.

98
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,674
多姆 是莱蒂

99
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,469
遇害了
She's been murdered.

100
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:49,614
我们到这里作最后致意…
We have gathered here to pay our final respects to...

101
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,867
我们来追忆她的旅程…
Let us reflect on her journey...

102
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:01,334
"上帝是我的牧师 我本不需要 他使我接受…"
"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He makes me lie down..."

103
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,982
面部识别程序在特伦托

104
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,900
入境10分钟后发现了他
about 1 0 minutes after he crossed the border.

105
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,488
我不明白
I don't get it.

106
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,573
我以为他会来的
I thought he'd show.

107
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,089
我告诉你不要来的 他们在监视这里
I told you not to come. They're staking the place out.

108
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,633
- 如果他们发现你… - 不会的
- If they find you... - They won't.

109
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,639
好啦 瞧瞧你
Come on. Look at you.

110
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,376
莱蒂不让他们处理掉它
Letty wouldn't let them junk it.

111
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,547
即便它是个诅咒
Even though it is a goddamn curse.

112
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,303
她回来以后 就到这里
When she came back, she was always in here,

113
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,848
夜以继日地改进它
working on it day and night.

114
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,106
真是不可思议
It was weird.

115
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,693
就好像她知道你会回来
It was like she knew you were coming back.

116
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,073
我要看看出事现场
I want to see the crash site.

117
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:46,165
我刚和副局长通过电话
I just got off the phone with Deputy Director Lawson.

118
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,294
如果我们72小时内在布拉加的案子上还没进展
If we don't make serious inroads into the Braga case in the next 72 hours,

119
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,630
我们就都下岗了
they're gonna shut us down.

120
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,342
我知道是新来的 但是为什么那么急？
I know I'm a newbie here, but why the clock now?

121
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,219
因为已经两年了
Because it's been two years,

122
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,805
我们派去卧底的三个探员
and the last three agents we sent to infiltrate his organization

123
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,266
都裹着尸袋回来的
came back in body bags.

124
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,937
他运入境的海洛因比埃斯科巴10年的都多
He's moved more heroin across the border than Escobar did in 1 0 years.

125
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,815
这家伙成为国家安全最大的威胁之一
This guy is becoming one of our biggest national threats,

126
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,984
我们连他的照片都没有
and we don't even have a picture of him.

127
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:16,571
没有指纹！连出生日期都不知道！
We don't have prints! Not even a goddamn DOB!

128
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,826
大卫・帕克是什么人？
What's the status on David Park?

129
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,120
他是我们潜入布拉加组织的通行证？
lsn't he our ticket into the Braga organization?

130
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:27,999
我们通过数据库搜索 按可能性排序
We're running the name through city and county databases, sorting the possibilities.

131
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,001
已经有500个了
We've got over 500 already.

132
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:33,129
帕克不重要 对我来说就是个小混混
Park's insignificant. Sounds like another jerk-off to me.

133
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:37,175
不是的 没有帕克介绍 布拉加不会让车手给他送货
It's not. Without Park, Braga wouldn't have drivers to move his shipments.

134
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,011
监视交通 非法改装
Cross-check traffic. lllegal modifications.

135
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:44,432
街头赛车 这家伙肯定有记录 我们会抓住他
Street racing. This guy will definitely have a record. We'll find him.

136
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,726
最好如此
We better.

137
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,061
知道吗？
 What do you know?

138
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:52,815
你那小子特伦托的红色雪佛兰 在他家附近出现

你在看什么 脓包？
 What are you looking at, nutsack?

273
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,924
不知道 你说呢
I don't know. You tell me.

274
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:56,259
车手想要德怀特的东西
The racer wants what Dwight's got.

275
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:59,304
但是姑娘们 德怀特已经入选了
See, but, ladies, Dwight's already on the team.

276
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:01,348
你要想给布拉加开车的话得快点
You got to be fast if you want to drive for Braga.

277
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:04,267
- 有问题吗？ - 没
- Is there a problem here? - No.

278
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,772
你是帕克找来的吧？
You one of Park's guys, blondie?

279
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,357
是的
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

280
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,567
跟我来

Man, every corner's got a chingadera tuner racing for pinks.

289
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:03,201
那不是布拉加让我找的
That's not what Braga has got me looking for.

290
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:08,456
布拉加要的是能把一切抛在脑后的人
Braga wants someone that would sell their abuelita to be behind the wheel.

291
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:14,129
不是规规矩矩地开跑车
Someone that drives their 1 0-second cars not in a straight line,

292
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:18,425
而是穿过没人能去的地方
but to push it and make it through places no one else would take it.

293
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,719
真正的车手
Real drivers.

294
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,931
我们运什么？
So, what are we hauling?

295
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:29,352
布拉加付钱 你没必要知道
For the money Braga's paying, you don't need to know.

296
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:32,105
你说你要真正的车手
You just said you wanted real drivers.

297
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:37,277
真正的车手知道自己车里有什么
A real driver knows exactly what's in his car.

298
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,117
真正的车手
Mira, real driver,

299
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,205
没人逼你去开车
nobody's forcing you to race.

300
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,040
你是老大？
You the boss?

301
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:54,085
还是我和老大说话？
Or am I talking to the boss?

302
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,965
我看着像老大吗？
Do I look like a boss?

303
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:04,721
我的工作是找到最好的车手
My job is to find the best drivers, period.

304
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:08,475
谁赢得比赛谁就能知道 好不好？
Whoever wins the race gets the info. We cool?

305
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,940
好不好？
Are we cool?

306
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,818
好吧
Yeah, we're cool.

307
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,321
不太好
No, we ain't cool, man.

308
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:24,199
谁封闭街道？
Who's closing these streets?

309
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,578
没人 这是关键
No one. That's the point.

356
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,110
胡说八道！

357
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,154
向你妈妈哭去吧

我做了什么？

379
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:54,041
你因为私藏毒品被捕

那不是我的！
Yo, that ain't mine! No!

383
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,259

You know that's never gonna stick, right?

384
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:05,595
是啊
Yeah, it's not supposed to.

385
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:10,266

387
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,619
德怀特太不幸了
That's too bad about Dwight.

388
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:15,164
你进入他们组织那晚联邦调查局 搜查了他的房子

390
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:20,753
我想说我真没想到在这遇见你
I wish I could say I was surprised to see you here.

391
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:25,591
怎样才能让我不告诉他们你是警察
What's to stop someone from telling them you're a cop?

392
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:29,428
和我不告诉他们你来这的真正目的 是一回事吧
Probably the same thing that's keeping me from telling them why you're really here.

393
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,722
- 你们好吗 伙计们 - 你好
- What up, fellows? - Hey, how you doing?

跟我来 找点乐子

398
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:46,237
我听说你刚从牢里出来
I also heard you just got out of County.

399
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:47,905
嗯

400
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,991
听说过吉姆・加西亚吗？
You know a guy named Jim Garcia?

401
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:54,120
没有 地方大 很多名字 很多面孔
Nah. Big place. Lots of names, lots of faces.

402
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:58,666
你 很多人要抓你
And you, you're wanted by a lot of people, homes.

403
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:01,335
那可对生意不好
Yeah, that kind of heat can't be good for business.

404
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,338
那要看你怎么看这件事
Yeah, well, that depends on how you look at things.

405
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,799
我被抓 我坐牢
I go down, I do time.

406
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:09,510
真的坐牢
I do real time.

407
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:15,099
我不知道别人怎么样 只要我看到后面警车在追
I don't know about your other drivers, but when I see flashing lights in my mirror,

408
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:16,684
我可不会停
I don't stop.

409
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,066
你们两个认识吗？
Do you know each other?

410

01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:05,567
我们在联系各国的特工
We're contacting agencies in multiple countries.

549
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:10,655
很不幸 他们大多数都要手动 扫描指纹上传
Unfortunately, most of them have to manually scan their prints for us to upload.

550
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:13,575
奥康纳在5号线
O'Conner's on line five.

551
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:15,744
长官 您看看这个
And, sir, you should see this.

552
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:17,329
谢谢
Thank you.

553
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:28,840
讲话 奥康纳
Talk to me, O'Conner.

554
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,468
- 你到底去哪了？ - 我拿到货了
- Where the hell have you been? - I got the shipment.

555
01:05:31,552 --> 01:05:34,554
“我拿到货” 还是“我们拿到货”？
"l got the shipment," or "we got the shipment"?

556
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:36,681
你在说什么？
What are you taIking about?

557
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:41,227
交通监视器录到你和特伦托在一起的画面
Traffic cams in the area picked up pictures of you and Toretto together.

558
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:47,108
听者 奥康纳 把货带来 把特伦托带来
Listen to me, O'Conner. Bring in the shipment and bring in Toretto.

559
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:50,195
但我认为目标是布拉加 我们现在有机会
But I thought the point was to get Braga. We got an opportunity here.

560
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:52,864
布莱恩 没时间了
Brian, the clock stopped ticking.

561
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:56,034
把他们带来 明白吗？
Bring them in. Are we cIear?

562
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:01,706
奥康纳？
O'Conner?

563
01:06:11,717 --> 01:06:14,552
六千万就是这样子
So this is what $60 million looks like.

564
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,932
嗯 你得去找医生看看
Yeah, we got to get you to a doctor.

565
01:06:19,016 --> 01:06:21,685
我们要找个地方把它藏起来
We got to find a place to hide this.

566
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:25,438
我有个地方
I got a spot.

567
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:38,451
502号 酒后驾车 需要48小时扣押
502, wet reckless. I need a 48-hour hold.

568
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:42,414
找个地方吧
Out back. Any spot you can find.

569
01:06:47,586 --> 01:06:49,462
这没问题吗？
You sure about this?

570
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:56,594
是的 他们最不会搜查的地方 就是自己的押车场 相信我吧
Yeah. The last place they'll check, their own impound yard. Trust me.

571
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:04,978
我在想…
You know, I've been thinking,

572
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:07,522
你炸毁你的车的时候 把我的也炸了
when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.

573
01:07:07,606 --> 01:07:10,108
- 是吗？ - 嗯
- Yeah? - Yeah.

574
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:12,777
你欠我一辆跑车
So now you owe me a 1 0-second car.

575
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:16,364
- 是吗？ - 是的
- Is that right? - Yeah.

576
01:07:27,626 --> 01:07:29,335
现在扯平了
Now we're even.

577
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:47,896
你就这样让我离他远点？
Is this your way of keeping me away from him?

578
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:51,858
- 你是我唯一能求助的人 - 他是我哥哥 当然
- You're the only one I could call. - He's my brother, of course.

579
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:01,576
子弹不在里面
The bullet's not in there.

580
01:08:09,126 --> 01:08:13,088
我要清洗干净然后缝上 会有点疼
I'm gonna clean it and stitch it up. It's going to hurt.

581
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:15,632
我打赌你很享受这个
I bet you're going to enjoy this.

582
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,634
有点
A little.

583
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:23,014
- 要这个吗？ - 嗯
- Want some of this? - Yeah.

584
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,141
辣的
It's spicy.

585
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:28,520
我很喜欢
I like it hot.

586
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:31,856
多姆 你怎么了？
Dom, what are you doing?

587
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:34,859
你太着急了 要先祈祷的
You reached first, you have to say grace.

588
01:08:45,162 --> 01:08:49,040
感谢上帝
Thank you, Lord, for blessing this table.

589
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:55,255
赐给我们食物 家庭和友情
With food, family and friendship.

590
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:31,332
你问我为什么放走多姆
You asked me why I let Dom go.

591
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:36,087
我想是因为那个时刻
I think it's because at that moment,

592
01:09:37,798 --> 01:09:40,633
我尊重他胜过我自己
I respected him more than I did myself.

593
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:46,222
嗯
Yeah.

594
01:09:47,808 --> 01:09:52,937
我从多姆身上学到的是 什么都不重要 除非你有准则
One thing I learned from Dom is that nothing really matters unless you have a code.

595
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,443
你的准则是什么 布莱恩？
And what's your code, Brian?

596
01:10:00,821 --> 01:10:02,614
正在找呢
I'm working on it.

597
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:39,025
不好 嘿 多姆
Shit. Hey, Dom.

598
01:10:39,151 --> 01:10:41,694
- 你打算什么时候告诉我？ - 多姆 你在做什么？
- When were you gonna tell me? - Dom, what are you doing?

599
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:43,738
你打算什么时候告诉我 是你在背后指使莱蒂？
When were you gonna tell me you were running Letty?

600
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:46,157
- 让我解释… - 你打算什么时候…
- Let me explain... - When were you gonna...

601
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:52,872
多姆 住手！
Dom, stop!

602
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:55,124
- 你不明白 - 我不明白？
- You don't understand. - I don't understand?

603
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:56,417
住手！
Stop!

604
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:01,798
她是为了…
She did it for...

605
01:11:04,885 --> 01:11:06,427
多姆 住手！
Dom, stop!

606
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:08,638
住手！拜托！
Dom, stop it! Please stop!

607
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:21,693
她是为你 多姆！为你！
She did it for you, Dom! She did it for you!

608
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:30,535
莱蒂来找我要以为布拉加运货 来交换把你的名字从名单上除去
Letty came to me to clear your name in exchange for bringing down Braga.

609
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:36,082
她是为了让你回家！
She just wanted you to come home!

610
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:55,059
对不起 多姆！
I'm sorry, Dom!

611
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,561
对不起！
I'm sorry!

612
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:27,258
你最好有个解释 你直接违抗命令
 You better have one hell of an explanation. You disobeyed a direct order.

613
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:30,136
- 货在哪？ - 很安全
- Where's the shipment? - It's safe.

614
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:32,013
安全
It's safe.

615
01:12:32,097 --> 01:12:34,974
听者 我们可以拿这批货在媒体宣传
Look, we could use the shipment to parade in front of the media,

616
01:12:35,059 --> 01:12:36,976
说是从街头查获了几百磅海洛因
get a few hundred pounds of heroin off the street,

617
01:12:37,061 --> 01:12:40,772
但是布拉加以后还会运更多的货进来
but Braga's just gonna send another shipment next week and the week after that.

618
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:42,982
我们用这批货把布拉加引出来
Let's use the shipment to lure Braga out

619
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:45,109
把他们的头抓住
and lop the head off a multi-billion dollar cartel.

620
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:47,570
我们怎样做？
And how do you suggest we do that?

621
01:12:47,654 --> 01:12:49,614
和布拉加面对面交易
A hand-to-hand exchange with Braga.

622
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:51,074
他从不出现
He'll never show.

623
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:52,950
他不得不露面
He can't afford not to.

624
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:04,754
你有计划吗？
You got a plan?

625
01:13:06,256 --> 01:13:07,924
我们谈个交易
There's a price.

626
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:13,596
我们抓住布拉加 你放了特伦托
We bag Braga, you let Toretto walk.

627
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:24,607
- 喂 - 我是多姆
- Yes? - It's Dom.

628
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:27,944
我正想你呢
I was just thinking about you.

629
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:32,240
我给你我的号码的时候 希望你能打过来
You know, when I gave you my number, I was hoping you'd call.

630
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:35,368
但不是这种情况下
But not under these circumstances.

631
01:13:35,702 --> 01:13:38,830
什么情况下？我活着？
What circumstances? Me being alive?

632
01:13:39,873 --> 01:13:41,833
别对个人
Don't take it personaIIy.

633
01:13:42,334 --> 01:13:44,252
这是公事
It's just business.

634
01:13:44,336 --> 01:13:45,920
我自己有点公事
I got some business of my own.

635
01:13:47,214 --> 01:13:48,673
让坎波斯接电话
Get Campos.

636
01:13:51,176 --> 01:13:52,593
是他们
It's them.

637
01:13:56,932 --> 01:13:57,932
嗯
Uh-huh.

638
01:13:58,183 --> 01:14:02,186
布拉加就这样表现诚意？ 卸磨杀驴？
Was that how Braga inspires loyalty? Killing his drivers?

639
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:05,022
总能找到更多的车手
One can always find more drivers.

640
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:07,275
这是个好生意
It's just good business.

641
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:08,776
我要做笔交易
I want to trade.

642
01:14:09,069 --> 01:14:11,112
布拉加从不谈判
Braga doesn't negotiate.

643
01:14:11,196 --> 01:14:12,196
好吧
 Fine.

644
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:17,160
你向他解释六千万的货怎么就不见了
You explain to him how all of a sudden $60 million worth of product disappears.

645
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:20,163
我知道这对生意可不好
I know that can't be good for business.

646
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:22,790
你想要什么？
What do you want?

647
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:27,545
六百万现金 布拉加亲自送过来
Six million cash, delivered by Braga himself.

648
01:14:30,215 --> 01:14:31,841
我可不想当靶子
I don't Iike being shot at.

649
01:14:32,217 --> 01:14:35,470
我可不想冒生命危险 除非他也冒险前来
I ain't gonna put my neck out again unless he's got something to lose, too.

650
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:37,138
他不会来的
He'll never go for it.

651
01:14:37,222 --> 01:14:40,850
或者我和布拉加打交道 或者你去
Either I deal with Braga, or you do.

652
01:14:44,855 --> 01:14:46,397
时间和地点？
When and where?

653
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:05,374
队员已经就位 周围待命
Sir, players are onsite. Holding positions at the perimeter.

654
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:08,419
听者 所有人待命
All right. Listen up. Everybody stay frosty.

655
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:11,172
接到奥康纳信号前不得行动
We don't move a muscIe untiI O'Conner gives the signaI.

656
01:15:11,256 --> 01:15:13,966
他拿到钱的时候 我们知道该怎么办
When he gets the money, you know what to do.

657
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:17,011
好消息是 我们抓住这家伙时
Well, the good news is, when we get this guy,

658
01:15:17,095 --> 01:15:19,514
你就自由了
you walk out of here a free man.

659
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:21,307
他们这样和你说的？
Is that what they told you?

660
01:15:21,391 --> 01:15:23,017
是的 这是协议
Yeah, that's the deal.

661
01:15:23,101 --> 01:15:26,521
你还信圣诞老人这回事？
You still put milk and cookies out for Santa Claus?

662
01:15:27,814 --> 01:15:28,981
是啊
Yeah.

663
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:34,862
来了
Here.

664
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:37,031
以防万一
ln case things go shitty.

665
01:15:41,995 --> 01:15:44,038
像以前一样？
Just like old times?

666
01:15:44,122 --> 01:15:45,414
嗯
Yeah.

667
01:15:49,002 --> 01:15:50,294
你掉东西了
You dropped something.

668
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,547
- 这就是你想要的？ - 多姆…
- That's what you wanted, - right? Dom...

669
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:10,273
他没恶意 别担心
He's harmless. Don't worry about him.

670
01:16:12,025 --> 01:16:14,527
他真的为莱蒂遗憾
And he's really sorry about Letty.

671
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:18,447
我们的货呢？
Where's our stuff?

672
01:16:21,201 --> 01:16:24,495
曾经在这里面的货吗？
You mean the stuff that used to be in here, right?

673
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:29,458
我们见到布拉加 你就能见到货 这是协议
Well, you'll see it when we see Braga. That was the deal.

674
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:31,836
别担心
No worries.

675
01:16:32,212 --> 01:16:34,213
布拉加守信的
Braga keeps his word.

676
01:17:18,216 --> 01:17:19,717
二百万
$2 million.

677
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:23,554
我拿到我的东西后给你们剩下的钱
You get the rest when I get my property.

678
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:29,518
- 斯特萨克 - 我们找到匹配了
- Stasiak. - We got a match.

679
01:17:29,603 --> 01:17:31,646
指纹100%是布拉加的
The fingerprint's Braga's 1 00%.

680
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:34,190
正等待传真面部确认
Just waiting on faciaI confirmation via fax.

681
01:17:34,274 --> 01:17:36,233
我有个问题
I got a question for you.

682
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:40,071
你越狱时候穿的是粉的？
You wearing pink when you were clawing your way out of el barrio?

683
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:42,782
所有特警准备行动
Order all agents to move in.

684
01:17:42,866 --> 01:17:45,993
我们得到确认 头号疑犯身着灰色西装
We got confirmation. Primary suspect wearing gray suit.

685
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:47,078
行动
Let's move.

686
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:49,080
长官 奥康纳还没给出信号
Sir, O'Conner hasn't given us the signal yet.

687
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:52,500
你哪部分不明白？ 我们刚得到确认 快行动！
What part of that didn't you understand? We just got confirmation. Do it!

688
01:17:52,584 --> 01:17:55,920
头号疑犯身着灰色西装 重复！
Secure primary suspect in gray suit. Repeat!

689
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:58,589
头号疑犯身着灰色西装
Secure primary suspect in gray suit.

690
01:18:12,062 --> 01:18:14,772
你在想我在想什么 对吧？
You're thinking what I'm thinking, right?

691
01:18:17,567 --> 01:18:19,193
他不是布拉加
He ain't Braga.

692
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:24,782
糟糕
Oh, shit.

693
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:27,201
放下武器！联邦调查局的！
Drop your weapons! FBl!

694
01:18:27,619 --> 01:18:28,911
趴下！
Get down!

695
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:34,125
离开这！
Get out of here!

696
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:40,089
离开这 多姆！
Get out of here, Dom!

697
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:45,970
撞死他
Run him down.

698
01:18:46,471 --> 01:18:47,680
快走！
Go!

699
01:18:48,348 --> 01:18:50,015
坎波斯就是布拉加！
Campos is Braga!

700
01:18:57,482 --> 01:18:58,774
快走
Come on.

701
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:08,284
接近头号目标中
Approaching primary target.

702
01:19:08,827 --> 01:19:10,995
疑犯安全
Primary suspect is secure.

703
01:19:13,665 --> 01:19:15,458
全程他都在你们鼻子底下
He was under your nose the whoIe time.

704
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:17,752
现在布拉加跑了
Now Braga's escaped.

705
01:19:17,836 --> 01:19:20,796
特伦托向南边跑了 很可能越过了边界
Toretto's heading south, probably long across the border by now.

706
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:23,090
你知道你惹了什么麻烦吗 奥康纳先生？
Do you have any idea the kind of trouble you're in, O'Conner?

707
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:25,134
我在做我的工作
I was doing my job.

708
01:19:25,218 --> 01:19:27,762
他不是第一个你协助逃脱法律制裁的人
He ain't the first bad guy you helped escape the law's grasp.

709
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:29,805
你被停职了
As of now, you're being taken off active duty,

710
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:32,850
直到举行正式听证会
until this house can mount a formal inquiry.

711
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,771
布拉加呢？
What about Braga?

712
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:40,191
你不用再操心了
That's no longer your concern.

713
01:19:50,577 --> 01:19:52,077
我们知道了布拉加在哪
We now know where Braga is, right?

714
01:19:52,162 --> 01:19:55,623
海关通过卫星追踪他到他的老巢 墨西哥的台卡利
Customs tracked him via satellite to his home base in Tecali, Mexico.

715
01:19:55,707 --> 01:19:58,125
我们在墨西哥没有执法权
Mexico is out of our jurisdiction.

716
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:02,505
事实是
The fact is

717
01:20:02,589 --> 01:20:06,675
官员们忙着召开新闻发布会解释这次抓捕
the brass will be so busy holding press conferences over the seizure,

718
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,886
我们在背后行动
we'll skate under the radar.

719
01:20:09,346 --> 01:20:12,389
我认为我们的工作是做正确的事情
I thought we signed on to do the right thing.

720
01:20:50,762 --> 01:20:52,888
大家都在找你
Everyone's looking for you.

721
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:54,890
我就在这
I'm right here.

722
01:20:56,184 --> 01:20:57,518
很高兴看到你走出往事
It's nice to see you've gone with the times

723
01:20:57,602 --> 01:21:01,188
换成了电子燃料注入 看上去不错
and switched to electronic fuel injection. Looks good.

724
01:21:02,315 --> 01:21:04,400
菜鸟成专家了
Buster became a gearhead.

725
01:21:08,488 --> 01:21:10,281
我和你去
I'm going with you.

726
01:21:14,202 --> 01:21:16,871
我没打算带任何人回来
I don't plan on bringing anyone back.

727
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:20,165
我知道
I know.

728
01:21:28,925 --> 01:21:30,593
按下阀门
Hit that throttle.

729
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:57,995
嘿
Hey.

730
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:42,790
你怎样和你唯一的哥哥道别？
How do you say goodbye to your only brother?

731
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,377
你不需要
You don't.

732
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,656
我以为你不会出现的
I thought you weren't gonna show up.

733
01:23:57,741 --> 01:23:59,366
你救了我的命
You saved my life.

734
01:24:00,243 --> 01:24:02,703
我想还你个情
I'm willing to return the favor.

735
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:09,084
这会帮你找到布拉加
This will help get you to Braga.

736
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:14,381
多姆
Dom.

737
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:18,010
去那是自杀
Going in there is suicide.

738
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:28,312
我别无选择
I have no choice.

739
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:34,359
你一定很爱她
You must have loved her very much.

740
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:55,130
我的权力到这就结束了
So this is where my jurisdiction ends.

741
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:03,097
我的才刚开始
And this is where mine begins.

742
01:25:59,028 --> 01:26:06,076
- 欢迎来到布拉加阁下的房子 - 别担心 神父 一切都会好起来的
- welcome to the house of the lord, Sr.Braga. - Don't worry father, everthing's go.

743
01:26:12,177 --> 01:26:14,677
帮我们去天堂
To help us get to heaven.

744
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:30,976
请接收这份祝福
Please receive this blessing.

745
01:27:13,478 --> 01:27:15,354
你不会被宽恕的
You ain't forgiven.

746
01:27:18,816 --> 01:27:20,984
你们要逮捕我？
You boys want to arrest me?

747
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:23,946
在这里？
...in here.

748
01:27:24,030 --> 01:27:26,073
不 远不止
No, we're beyond that.

749
01:27:27,158 --> 01:27:29,952
这次你跑不了了
You can't buy your way out of this one.

750
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:32,996
你和我…
You and me...

751
01:27:34,207 --> 01:27:37,042
你和我没什么不同
You and me, we're not so different.

752
01:27:38,795 --> 01:27:40,379
你不是英雄
You're no hero.

753
01:27:51,015 --> 01:27:52,683
说得没错
You're right.

754
01:27:55,812 --> 01:27:59,147
所以你逃回了边界
And that's why you're going back across the border.

755
01:28:05,154 --> 01:28:06,863
菲尼克斯是我的
But Fenix is mine.

756
01:28:07,865 --> 01:28:08,949
没问题
You got it.

757
01:28:31,222 --> 01:28:32,347
不好！
Shit!

758
01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:40,939
如果你能跑出两英里 算你走运
You'll make it a couple of miles out, if you're lucky.

759
01:29:33,493 --> 01:29:35,744
你知道你要去哪吗？
You know where you're going?

760
01:29:36,788 --> 01:29:38,955
想借我的GPS？
You want to borrow my GPS?

761
01:29:42,668 --> 01:29:44,378
你的人呢？
Where are your boys at?

762
01:29:44,462 --> 01:29:46,004
还出不出现？
Are they going to show up or what?

763
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:51,510
你得小心点
Careful what you ask for.

764
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:10,028
停车 停车吧
Just stop. Just stop the car.

765
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:24,835
别打着老板 笨蛋
Don't shoot the boss, idiots.

766
01:30:30,216 --> 01:30:31,925
就在你后面
Right behind you.

767
01:30:46,774 --> 01:30:49,860
多姆 前往隧道 我们利用隧道
Dom, head to the tunnel. Let's use the tunnel.

768
01:31:17,096 --> 01:31:19,055
离开这 布莱恩
Get out of here, Brian.

769
01:31:26,814 --> 01:31:30,317
你确定知道隧道在哪？确定吗？
You sure you know where the tunnels are? You sure?

770
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:32,611
是的 我会抓紧点
Yeah. I'd hold on.

771
01:31:35,698 --> 01:31:37,365
这可能会疼
This might hurt.

772
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:52,923
现在到我的地盘了 宝贝
You're in my world now, baby!

773
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:24,079
就这样 宝贝！前面没路了
That's it, baby! End of the road.

774
01:32:24,163 --> 01:32:25,622
现在想怎样？
Now what?

775
01:32:26,415 --> 01:32:27,499
玩完了
Game over.

776
01:32:27,583 --> 01:32:29,125
不
No, no, no.

777
01:32:58,739 --> 01:33:00,156
快点！
Come on!

778
01:34:19,362 --> 01:34:20,445
嘿！
Hey!

779
01:34:21,572 --> 01:34:23,406
那我弄出来！
Get me out of here!

780
01:35:53,539 --> 01:35:54,956
脓包
Pussy.

781
01:36:12,349 --> 01:36:13,975
我看看
Let me see that.

782
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:18,897
压住
Yeah. Just keep pressure there.

783
01:36:19,565 --> 01:36:21,566
你会没事的
You'll be all right.

784
01:36:27,448 --> 01:36:29,532
你得离开这
You gotta get out of here.

785
01:36:32,161 --> 01:36:34,162
我不再逃跑了
I ain't running anymore.

786
01:36:39,794 --> 01:36:41,878
我问你件事
I gotta ask you something.

787
01:36:42,546 --> 01:36:43,671
嗯？
Yeah?

788
01:36:44,423 --> 01:36:48,468
你知道如果你不作弊 那次赛车我就赢了 对吧
You know I would have won that race if you didn't cheat, right?

789
01:36:51,555 --> 01:36:53,473
你头撞得不轻吧
You hit your head hard.

790
01:36:58,354 --> 01:37:00,230
别让我笑了
Don't make me laugh.

791
01:37:10,908 --> 01:37:12,283
全体起立
All rise.

792
01:37:17,581 --> 01:37:19,290
请坐
Please be seated.

793
01:37:23,546 --> 01:37:25,588
请起立 特伦托先生
Please rise, Mr. Toretto.

794

特别考虑了
and taken into special consideration

奥康纳探员为特伦托先生的请愿
Agent O'Conner's appeal of clemency on behalf of Mr. Toretto.

797
01:37:37,935 --> 01:37:40,603
他的行为直接导致大毒枭

798
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:43,523
阿图罗・布拉加的被捕

799
01:37:45,067 --> 01:37:46,442
但是
However,

800
01:37:47,736 --> 01:37:49,696
司法部认为
this judiciary finds that

801
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:54,617
一件正确的事不能弥补一生犯下的错
one right does not make up for a lifetime worth of wrongs.

802
01:37:55,286 --> 01:37:57,036
因此
And as such,

803
01:37:57,121 --> 01:38:02,125
我不得不按加州法律判最终刑期
I find that I am forced to level the maximum sentence under California law.

804
01:38:04,545 --> 01:38:06,212
多米尼克・特伦托
Dominic Toretto,

805
01:38:07,047 --> 01:38:11,050
你被判在隆波克监狱
