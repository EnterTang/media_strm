1
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,991
截拳道讲求速度
The style of Jeet Kune Do demands speed...

2
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,673
准确性和力量
accuracy and power.

3
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,796
大师！大师
Master, Master...

4
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,237
外面有人来向你挑战
Someone else is here to challenge you.
He's waiting outside.

5
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,116
这些全是无用之辈
These fools, they'll never learn.

6
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,068
请用茶
Some tea for you, sir.

7
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,634
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

8
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,029
请用茶
Your tea, sir.

9
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,230
你根本不是我对手
You're no fighter.

10
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,595
接住
Catch.

11
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,036
到你出招，动手吧
It's your move. Come on.

12
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,634
你敢向我挑战？
You dare to challenge me?

13
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,270
要不是我脚下留情，你恐怕早就没命了
You're lucky I'm a fair man,
Or else you'd be dead.

14
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,675
走吧
Beat it.

15
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,476
这些日子到处也是挑战者
Challengers are everywhere.

16
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,311
人人都想做天下第一
Everybody wants to be number one.

17
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,351
那一定有事情会发生了
Then something must be cooking.

18
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,829
是，有人向我挑战
Yes, I was challenged, too.

19
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,357
但你已经打败了他吧
But you beat him, of course.

20
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,237
是
Yeah.

21
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,869
你的意思是那是突如其来的挑战？
You mean the challenge came just out of the blue?

22
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,475
没错
That's right.

23
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,437
上星期
Last week...

24
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,752
我收到一个韩国功夫专家的挑战信
I received a letter of challenge
from a Korean master.

25
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,158
他说你和我并不是别人说的那样本事
He said people like you and
I aren't as good as our reputation.

26
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,391
看来有些人想我们死
Seems like quite a few people
want to see us dead.

27
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,199
他还说如果我到时不出现
He said if I didn't show up for the fight...

28
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,236
就会伤害我家人
he'd do something bad to my family.

29
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,751
我对这人很感兴趣，所以便决定接受挑战
I was so intrigued by his letter,
that I decided to show up.

30
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,395
我并不是因为怕你才来
I'm not here because of your stupid threat.

31
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,438
我只想看看，什么样的笨人会写那信
I just want to meet the man
who's dumb enough to write that note.

32
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,671
就在此一决高下吧
Come on, let's get it over with.

33
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,631
你记住，功夫是用来自卫的艺术
Remember, kung fu is the art of self defense.

34
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,233
我不会用来杀人的！
I'm not interested in killing.

35
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,960
让我证明你只是个功夫败类
I just want to prove how bad your kicks are.

36
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,911
你才是功夫败类
You must be talking about yourself.

37
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,631
这就是我们所谓的控制能力
That's what we call control.

38
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,637
你永远也不会明白的了
Something you may never understand.

39
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,037
老友
Now my friend, listen.

40
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,591
你最好祈求我们不会再见面
You'd better hope that we never meet again.

41
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,874
如果你敢伤害我家人，你一定会后悔的
If you dare to harm my family, you'll regret it.

42
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,472
因为我发誓到时候
Because I swear,

43
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,837
你再不会有能力打人了
you'll never be able to kick again.

44
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,592
我不知道这些挑战者有什么目的
I wonder what's behind all these challenges.

45
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,397
但我认为我们不必怕他们
But I don't think we need to fear them.

46
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,159
你有什么意见？
What do you think?

47
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,758
可能有人想致我们于死地
Someone may want us dead.

48
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,350
就等他们放马过来吧
Let them try.

49
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,759
我觉得有些不祥之兆
I think something will happen, something bad.

50
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,836
棍法
Use staves.

51
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,794
试试你们的风雷棍法
Power them like thunder.

52
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,877
有客人来了
A visitor.

53
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,118
原来是李振强，真是贵客临门
So it is you. It's Billy Lo.

54
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,468
阿弥陀佛
Buddha's name be praised.

55
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,830
大师
Abbot.

56
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,239
我们很久没有见面了
It's been a long time.

57
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,071
大师近来好吗？
Forgive me. I trust you're well.

58
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,317
请到后园详谈
We've much to discuss.

59
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,796
大师
Abbot.

60
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,035
刚才你一到这儿就把白鸽吓走了
The pigeons sensed your presence.

61
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,555
我怕
But I'm afraid

62
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:43,396
这是个不详的预兆
their swift departure is a bad omen.

63
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,593
你要小心
You must take care.

64
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,832
我会紧记的了
I shall take your advice.

65
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,677
振强，你要记着
Billy, remember this,

66
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,909
没有人是不败之躯
No one is unbeatable.

67
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,470
最重要的是，你弟弟向你学习
It's important that your brother learns from you.

68
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,519
我弟弟怎么样了
He's still making trouble?

69
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,508
既然你已经来了
Since you're already here

70
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,632
就不妨在这里住几天吧
why not stay for a few days?

71
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,278
你弟弟会很高兴的
Your brother would welcome it.

72
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,349
我明白你意思
I know what you mean.

73
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,554
振国这个人自小就很任性
Bobby's a rebel.

74
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,995
所以我今天特地来看看他
That's why I felt that I should come and see him.

75
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,109
一来怕他不肯专心学艺
I've determined to make sure that
he practices hard,

76
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,234
二来又怕他去惹是生非
work more, and I'll see that
he stays clear of trouble.

77
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,797
他根本不懂珍惜他的所有
Actually, he doesn't appreciate
what he has here...

78
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,792
能够在大师门下学习武功
The chance to learn kung fu from a master...

79
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,676
可算是他一生的造化
such as you.

80
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,550
如果我弟弟还是执迷不悟的话
But if Bobby persists in being lazy,

81
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,269
我一定要教训他
he must be punished.

82
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,634
给多些耐性吧
Be patient with him.

83
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,756
青年人浮躁一点是在所难免的
He's still young and impatient.

84
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,477
我知道振国的武功虽然是有一点根基
But I know him too well.

85
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,596
但这么快他已经自以为是了
So little training and he thinks he's good.

86
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,314
要更进一步，他就非要自强不息不可
But to become an expert, he has to study
and practice harder!

87
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,188
我知道他一定会听你的意见
I'm sure he will take your advice.

88
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,153
他是我唯一的弟弟
He's my only brother,

89
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,674
爹跟我都希望他学有所成
and my father and I want him to succeed

90
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,509
能够把我们中国的国术发扬光大
and pass on to others the benefits of kung fu.

91
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,151
我明白
I understand that.

92
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,475
我知道你非常的关心他，和他的将来
I know, too, how much you care
about him and his future.

93
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,435
但我希望你劝他时，语气不要太强硬
But when you talk to him, don't be too mean to him.

94
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,272
要友善一点，要令他明白你的意思
Be sincere with him. Make sure he understands.

95
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,078
还有
And remember...

96
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,797
你小时候也不是个到处闯祸的小孩吗？
When you were a child, you were also...

97
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,519
什么顽皮的事你也做过
always up to mischief.

98
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,274
你还不肯读书，常在街上游荡、偷东西
You didn't study hard. Instead
you wandered the streets, stealing things.

99
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,153
我记得
Yes, I remember that.

100
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,154
我当时没规矩、没分寸，亦不懂尊重别人
I had no discipline, no principles,
no respect for anybody.

101
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,595
你连警察也不怕呢
You weren't even afraid of the police.

102
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,356
你那无知的面，真的骗了很多成人
You also had that innocent look that
would fool any adult...

103
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,193
因为没人知道你这小鬼心想些什么
couldn't tell what that mischievous mind was up to.

104
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,479
你这个小贼
Hey, you little thief!

105
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,674
哼！你敢偷我的东西？
You're stealing my...

106
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,991
你还是恃强凌弱的小鬼呢
you were also a bully.

107
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,069
是，我是
I sure was.

108
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,035
你为什么这样做？
What did you do that for?

109
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,395
因为我不喜欢你
Because I don't like you.

110
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,355
我也讨厌你
And I hate you, too.

111
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,555
我会告诉你的父母
I'll go tell your parents.

112
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,079
待他们打你一顿就好了
I hope you'll get beaten.

113
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,230
幸好你当时不懂武功
Fortunately, you didn't know any kung fu.

114
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,356
但你连盲的也打
You even attacked old blind men.

115
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,794
身为武者，我永远不会这样做
As a martial artist I'd never do that.

116
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,036
我已经忘了从前的自己是那么恐怖
I'd forgotten I was such a terror.

117
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,989
你年纪这么小竟去袭击一个老人？
My goodness...so small,
and you dare to attack an old man!

118
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,560
谁管你老不老？这世界只有强者才能生存
Who cares if you're old? Only the strong survive.

119
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,036
我要杀了你
I'll kill you.

120
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,710
呀！救命呀
Help...

121
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,672
直到你长大，搬去和你姐一起住后
It was only later after you had grown up...
and moved in with your sister,

122
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:09,148
你才开始听话和自律
that you started listening to her pleas
for self-discipline.

123
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,991
妈没要我的钱
Here, Mother wouldn't take my money.

124
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,518
这些钱是你赌时骗回来的，她当然不要啦
Of course she wouldn't.
You got it by cheating at cards.

125
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,513
至少不是偷来的
At least I didn't steal it.

126
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,829
我知道
I know how you feel.

127
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,229
是我让你感到羞耻吧
You're ashamed of me.

128
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,632
我是家中之耻
I'm the black sheep of the family.

129
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,798
每个人也看不起我
Everybody despises me.

130
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,352
振强，我不理其他人怎说
I don't care what they say, Billy.

131
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,355
我和妈只在乎你对自己做了什么
Our mother and I care about
what you do to yourself.

132
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,839
姐，别担心，我知道怎样做了
Don't worry. I know what I have to do from now on.

133
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,274
妈，以前我错了
Mother, I've been wrong.

134
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,749
但现在我知道怎么做了
But I understand now.

135
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,158
我要你为我感到自豪
I'll make sure you're proud of me.

136
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,996
现在就轮到你弟放任了
Now it's your brother's turn.

137
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,240
他还年青，思想方面还没有成熟
He's still young, immature, full of his own ideas.

138
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,600
我肯定你和他谈了以后，他会有所改变
I'm sure he'll soon change his outlook
once you have a talk with him.

139
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,592
希望你说得对啦
I just hope that you're right.

140
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,908
你从不说错
You've never failed.

141
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,589
去见你的弟弟吧
Go meet your brother.

142
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,830
好
Right.

143
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,518
振国
Dear Bobby. How are you?

144
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,199
匆匆来访
I was hoping to see you...

145
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,835
未及相见
but you were out.

146
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,350
闻悉吾弟近来行为不甚检点，深以为憾
I gather you're not studying or training
so hard lately.

147
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,078
汝须知
I guess I don't have to tell you...

148
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,120
精武惟勤
that to become an expert in the art of kung fu
you must practice more.

149
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,437
惟情欲伤身，欲成大业，自当养气修身
There'll be time for girls later.

150
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,155
学大师之所教
Learn all that the Abbot teaches you.

151
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,230
今特赠拳汰一本
I'm leaving you my boxing manual.

152
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,437
望你潜心苦练
in the hope that you'll find it useful.

153
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,039
戒除旁骛
Try to concentrate.

154
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,991
匆负父兄期望
Don't let Father and me down.

155
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,988
珍重
Take care of yourself. Bye now.

156
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,554
兄振强留字
Your brother, Billy.

157
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,879
"Mysterious Death of Famous Japanese
Martial Artist Chin Ku"

158
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,675
死得太突然了
Died too suddenly.

159
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,876
你整晚也没睡
You haven't slept all night.

160
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,829
是
Yes, I know.

161
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,154
爸爸请坐
Sit down, Dad.

162
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,791
秦谷这么好武功
Too bad about Chin Ku.

163
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,554
死了实在太可惜
Kung fu expert dies so young.

164
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:04,870
是的
That's right.

165
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,433
你说，他会不会走火入魔呀？
Tell me. Do you think that he over-trained?

166
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,880
哎，你不能做什么的了
There's nothing you can do now.

167
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,475
不要再胡思乱想了
Don't think too much.

168
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,959
早点睡吧
Try to get some sleep.

169
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,514
爸爸你放心好了，我不会胡思乱想的
Don't worry, father. I won't let it bother me.

170
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,198
过两天他出殡，我想去拜祭他
I'll attend his funeral in a few days.

171
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,873
我想你代表我去
And I'd like you to represent me, too.

172
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,995
爸爸你不去呀？
You're not going?

173
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,753
不去了，我身体不好
No. I'm far too old to travel, my son.

174
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,239
路程又远
It isn't wise.

175
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,238
那我找振国一块儿去好不好？
Think Bobby ought to come along with me?

176
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,670
你还是不要去找他
No, I'd rather he didn't go.

177
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,077
这件事不需他知道
He shouldn't be told of this.

178
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,629
爸爸，为什么呢？
But why not, father?

179
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,271
因我不想分散他学习的精神
It's better that we shouldn't disturb the lad.

180
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,478
也好，那我自己去
Okay. In that case, I'll go alone.

181
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,673
你到那儿以后先找他的女儿
First thing to do is to look for his daughter.

182
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,589
怎么他有女儿？
He has a daughter?

183
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,398
据说这是秦谷的私生女儿
The truth is, she's his stepdaughter.

184
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,916
看不出他挺风流的嘛
That's a surprise. He sure kept that quiet.

185
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,797
这件事很少人知道
Only his friends knew the truth.

186
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,355
她现在在那儿？
Do you know where she lives now?

187
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,156
叫什么名字？
What's her name?

188
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,919
她的名字叫秦思美子
Her name's May

189
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,432
在日本的一间夜总会里面登台唱歌
I think she sings at a club in Ginza.

190
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,714
你就查一下吧
You'll have to make some inquiries.

191
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,069
欢迎
Welcome, Sir.

192
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,595
你来干什么？
What do you want?

193
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,110
你是谁？
Who are you?

194
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,959
我是来找你的
I'd like to talk to you.

195
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,676
找我？
Talk to me?

196
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,199
我可不认识你
I don't even know you.

197
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,199
我知道你不认识我
Don't let that bother you...

198
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,393
但我可认识你
because I know you.

199
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,709
你可是疯的呀
You must be crazy!

200
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,475
你在说什么废话？
You're talking rubbish.

201
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,276
我没说废话
No, I'm not.

202
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,596
我叫李振强
I'm Li Chun Chang.

203
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,675
我认识你爹
I knew your father.

204
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,954
是他的好朋友
We were good friends.

205
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,633
你爹已经死了
Your father just died.

206
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,551
难道你一点儿也不哀伤？
Aren't you ashamed of singing and
enjoying yourself in here?

207
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,750
还有那么好心情去唱歌
Don't you feel any grief at all?

208
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,909
我不知
I don't.

209
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,109
死了
So, he's dead.

210
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,394
又怎么样？
So what?

211
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,353
再哀伤他也不会回来
Being sad won't bring him back.

212
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,478
听你的话好像一点父女之情都没有
You seem to have very little respect
for the old man.

213
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,679
他从来都不照顾我
He never cared for me.

214
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,238
我不唱歌怎么生活？
So I sing to make a living.

215
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:52,474
话虽这么说，但他始终是你的亲生父亲
Nevertheless, you ought to respect him.
He was your father.

216
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,997
我妈死时他也没有来拜她
Some father! Where was he when Mother died?

217
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,470
过去的算了吧
Forget the past.

218
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,628
我当然会
You bet I will.

219
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,273
现在人已经死了
Nothing I can do about it now.

220
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,992
我想不算也不行
Just pretend it never happened.

221
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,876
但秦谷为什么无缘无故的死去？
I can't figure out why he died so suddenly?

222
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,838
他的身体一向也很好的呀
Chin Ku was a strong man, so full of life...
It's strange.

223
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,592
他的事我不大清楚
I don't know much about him at all.

224
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,436
他很久没有来看我了
We hadn't been in contact for a long time.

225
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,393
只是上个月来过一次
But he came to see me last month.

226
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,312
他很久没有来看你，那一次来一定有原因
If you lost contact for so long,
why did he suddenly come see you?

227
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,436
不知道
I don't know.

228
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,393
他只留下一盒东西，叫我好好的替他保管
But he left a box with me.
He said to keep it safe.

229
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,476
是什么？
What is it?

230
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,954
我怎会知？
I'm not sure.

231
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,753
我想是一盒影片
A roll of film, I think.

232
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,910
在那儿？
Where is the film?

233
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,069
能不能给我看？
Can you show it to me?

234
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,190
这儿
Here!

235
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,075
在里面
Inside this box.

236
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,752
我到里面看看，你在这儿等我
I'm going in. Stay here and wait for me.

237
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,715
我要少少时间
I need a moment.

238
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,236
你干什么？
What do you want?

239
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,269
这儿不许任何人进来
No one's allowed in here.

240
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,153
秦谷是我的好朋友
I'm a good friend of Chin Ku's.

241
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,595
我想见他最后一面
I just want to pay my last respects to him.
That's all.

242
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,958
什么人也不可进来
I told you, no one comes in.

243
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,191
聪明的话就立刻出去吧
If you're wise, leave right now!

244
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,912
我亲爱的儿子振国，我很遗憾地告诉你
Bobby, my son. Sadly I must tell you...

245
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,434
振强已经死了
that your brother, Billy, is dead.

246
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,793
他为了，要找出秦谷死去的原因
He was trying to find out
why his friend Chin Ku died.

247
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,750
为了其他人有所得着
He devoted his life to the art of kung fu.

248
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,435
他将生平所研究的武功心得
His own style of Jeet Kune Do...

249
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,159
截拳道的独特风格
recorded for the benefit of everyone...

250
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,469
都写在振强拳法里面
in his books and manuals.

251
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,359
当你收到这封信后
My son, after you've read this letter...

252
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,716
马上去日本找十郎
go to Japan and meet up with Sherman Lan.

253
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,792
查明这件事的真相，替你哥哥报仇
Find out who killed your brother. Seek revenge.

254
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,270
这样，他才会安息
Only then, will his soul rest in peace.

255
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,916
振国你好
Hey, Bobby!

256
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,269
十郎你好
Hi Sherman!

257
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,629
对不起，我迟到了
I'm sorry I'm a bit late.

258
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,993
我也刚到，上车再说吧
Just arrived myself. Let's go!

259
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,349
你哥哥生前留下的
This is all your brother left.

260
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,157
只是一些影片。你收起来好啦
It's a roll of film.
I think you'd better have it.

261
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,348
这枝镖就是杀死你哥哥的凶器
This dart is the weapon that
was used to kill your brother.

262
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,557
为什么他们要劫走秦谷的棺材？
Do you have any idea why
they wanted to steal Chin Ku's coffin?

263
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,391
那我不知道
I've no idea. It's a mystery to me.

264
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,992
我看这件事一定有古怪
It's all very strange.

265
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:13,996
我不明白
I don't understand.

266
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,353
不过总会有些原因吧
There must have been a reason.

267
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,390
那是什么呢？
But what?

268
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,637
我带你去看长老
Anyway, I'll take you to our master.

269
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,675
他正在等你
He's waiting for you...

270
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,838
十郎，我一定要报仇
Sherman, I'm going to get my revenge.

271
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,991
对，我们一定会帮你
Of course, we'll help you all we can.

272
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,956
但你要想清楚，不要意气用事
But you need to think it through carefully.

273
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,915
这是什么地方？
What's this place?

274
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,359
这就是死亡古堡
The Palace of Death.

275
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,835
这个外国人是谁？
Who's that foreigner?

276
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,028
他就是死亡堡主鲁易士
That's Lewis. Master of the palace.

277
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,715
这个人呢？
Who's that guy?

278
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,232
是他的管家
That's Lewis' valet.

279
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,270
那是秦谷！为什么他会在这儿？
Oh, Chin Ku...What's he doing there?

280
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,511
是呀，他是堡主的客人
Well, he was Lewis' guest.

281
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,958
他们好像是老朋友嘛
They look like great friends.

282
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,034
管家只有一只手
The valet's lost an arm.

283
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,071
但他不像残障的呀
He doesn't look handicapped, though.

284
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,952
他对堡主很忠心
He's very loyal to Lewis.

285
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:26,876
常常寸步不离的
Never leaves his side for a minute.

286
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,155
那外国人在跟秦谷学功夫？
What's Chin Ku doing...teaching Lewis kung fu?

287
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,040
鲁易士非常沉迷中国功夫
Seems that Lewis is interested in kung fu

288
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,594
据说他还好勇斗狠
for the purpose of killing. Seems to enjoy it.

289
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,233
简直心理变态
The man is mad!

290
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,552
这古堡看起来有点儿古怪
It's strange...that Palace of Death.

291
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,157
我一定要进去查一下
I think I'm going to check it out.

292
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,919
至于鲁易士
Forget Lewis.

293
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,270
他的功夫其实很平常
His kung fu's not that hot.

294
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,836
但凡是走进古堡的人
The Death Palace is a death trap.

295
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,831
没有一个能活着出来
No one ever leaves that place alive!

296
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,270
因为这古堡是个死亡陷阱，小心
So please, be very careful.

297
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,871
李振国在外求见
Master, there's a Bobby Lo to see you.

298
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,555
难道这人是李振强的弟弟？
Bobby Lo? Could he be Billy Lo's brother?

299
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,709
究竟这个小流氓想要什么呢
I wonder what that little punk wants with me?

300
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,392
叫管家请他进来吧
Tell the valet to show him in.

301
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,396
是
Right.

302
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,198
大概是为了李振强的事吧
Maybe it's about Billy's death.

303
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,631
你是李振国先生吗？
So you are Mr. Bobby Lo.

304
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,834
欢迎
Welcome.

305
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,431
你是李振强的弟弟，对吗？
I suppose you're Billy Lo's younger brother.

306
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,271
不错。听说死亡古堡是个可怕的地方
That's right. I hear the Palace of Death
really lives up to its name.

307
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,197
因为凡是到这里的人都不会活着走出去
They say no one leaves here alive,

308
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,191
我好像走进了死亡谷吧
Iike I walk into the valley of death.

309
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,870
不…这都是外面的人造谣生非
Not true. They're just vicious rumors.

310
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,438
你要知道，人就是这样
You know what people are like.

311
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,872
别人告诉我你跟秦谷是很要好的朋友
People tell me you were
a very good friend of Chin Ku.

312
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,077
是。他的武功非常的好
Yeah, his kung fu is excellent.

313
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,199
我很尊重他
I respect him.

314
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,075
我也有点妒忌他
Perhaps even jealous of him.

315
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,030
你说的话是什么意思？
What are you trying to suggest?

316
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,036
秦谷的确到我这儿来过
Chin Ku did spend some time here before,

317
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,917
可是他的死完全与我无关
but I have nothing to do with his death.

318
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,039
真的没关系？
Is that right?

319
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,558
这件事已经过去，我们不必再提了
Anyway, that's over, Let's forget it.

320
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,236
既然你有胆子到这里来
Since you had the guts to come here,

321
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,916
那就让我带你到处参观一下
Iet me show you around.

322
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,917
我想你会有兴趣的
I think you'll find it interesting.

323
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,231
我知道那会是个有趣的体验
I'm sure it'll be an experience.

324
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,993
是我的荣幸
The pleasure's all mine.

325
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,037
我很欣赏你的言行举止
I'm impressed with your manners.

326
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,630
现且看你有没有勇气
Now, let's see if you have courage.

327
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,480
来，你会觉得这地方很吸引的
Come on, I'm sure you'll find it fascinating.

328
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,919
看那边
Now, look over there.

329
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,549
我在那儿养了很多特别训练的孔雀
I keep a lot of specially trained peacocks.

330
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,710
它们都听我的指挥
They obey my every command.

331
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,591
孔雀也会听你的指挥？
Peacocks obeying your command?

332
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,198
的确是很特别
That's quite remarkable.

333
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,713
是的
Exactly.

334
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,557
它们已经过很多的训练
It takes a lot of training.

335
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,951
了不起，对吧？
It's quite fantastic, isn't it?

336
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:11,757
看看那边
Look at that.

337
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,397
是呀
Yeah.

338
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,034
这些全是大狮子，好怕呢
They're really big lions. God, I'm frightened!

339
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,748
真是四周都是狮子
There are so many of them.

340
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,355
这些狮子都是由非洲买回来的
They had them all imported from Africa.

341
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,674
是最大和最优秀的品种
I selected the biggest and best of their breed.

342
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,037
它们有很大的胃口
They have enormous appetites.

343
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:34,915
而且喜欢吃新鲜多汁而且生的人肉
And their favorite food is fresh,
juicy, raw human meat.

344
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,508
吃人不吐骨头，就是它们
They all eat a lot, bones and all.

345
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,434
每次我会把向我挑战而失败的人
Anyone who comes to challenge me, and then loses

346
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,476
都给这些畜牲当点心吃
ends up as dinner for the lions.

347
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,197
这些人平时都很了不起
My challengers all try to act very tough.

348
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,199
但一见到狮子就脚软了
But not for long.

349
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,031
我不觉得他们的反应有什么出奇
I'm not surprised they're scared.

350
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:05,191
希望我这一次不会变成狮子的点心就好了
I certainly hope I won't end up
as their dinner tonight.

351
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,551
不用担心，你不会的
Don't worry, friend. You won't.

352
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:12,993
我们在等什么？
What are we waiting for then?

353
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,798
走吧！走吧
Come on. Let's go. come on, ok?

354
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,430
狮子是万兽之王
The lion is truly King of all beasts.

355
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,159
是最快和最有力量的动物
They're the fastest and most powerful of all.

356
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:29,390
一个好的武术家，就应该有这种兽性
A good martial artist should have the speed
and power of a lion.

357
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,712
尤其是跟人搏击时
Especially when fighting his enemies,

358
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,998
就应该像狮子一样残忍
he should be ruthless like the lion, a killer!

359
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,958
那你为什么要养孔雀？
Why do you keep the peacocks?

360
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:41,233
我喜欢它们凌空飞翔的姿势
I like the way they move. So swift and so sure.

361
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,836
武术家不但要有狮子的勇猛
Martial artists should be fierce like a lion...

362
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,273
还要有孔雀的快速感
and swift like a peacock...

363
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,157
所以我要研究它们的动作和姿势
so I study their styles.

364
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,392
你的见解的确是很有趣
An interesting theory.

365
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:55,831
报告堡主
Sir,

366
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:58,479
自称西关双侠的阎氏兄弟向你挑战
two men claiming to be
the Yen brothers want to challenge you.

367
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,798
这两个傻人，真不知好歹
Those two stupid fools!

368
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,759
竟向我挑战？
There are no match for me!

369
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,594
孙管家，带他们去后山
All right Sun, take them to the cemetery first.

370
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,635
看看那些墓碑
Let them look around.

371
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,716
看完之后他们就可能会改变主意
May be then they'll change their minds.

372
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,675
是
Sir.

373
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,629
看，这些墓碑，就是我们堡主的成绩表
See. These are the gravestones of
my master's challengers.

374
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,150
你们很快就会和他们一样被埋在墓里
I'm afraid you'll be joining them very soon.

375
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,438
如果我是你，我就会立即离开这里
I'd leave now if I were you.

376
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,194
除非你想年轻早逝
unless you want to die young.

377
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,992
我们不会因你的话而改变主意
You can't make us change our minds.

378
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,594
我们就不怕死，叫他出来
We're not afraid of him! Call him out here.

379
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,315
都这么晚了
It's rather late.

380
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:02,915
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

381
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,273
冈叮才有人偷袭我
Somebody has just attacked me.

382
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,754
有人偷袭你？
Someone attacked you?

383
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,076
不可能
No way.

384
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,479
没有人敢这样做
No one would dare to.

385
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,672
这个人刚刚被我打跑了
I just fought him off.

386
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,349
不用紧张
Take it easy.

387
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,999
我们明天再说吧
We'll talk tomorrow.

388
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:09,756
早
Morning!

389
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,514
想不到你这么早就来了
So you're an early riser, too.

390
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,188
请坐
Have a seat.

391
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,917
我会不会妨碍你吃早餐？
I hope I'm not interrupting your breakfast?

392
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,790
当然不会。要一起吃吗？
Of course not. Why not join me?

393
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,110
很好吃的
Great meal.

394
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,599
这是生鹿肉
This is raw venison.

395
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,429
和鹿血
Deer's blood.

396
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,389
要不要试试看？
Why not have some with me?

397
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,197
谢谢
No, thanks.

398
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,715
我不会认为这些是美味早餐
Not my idea of a nice breakfast.

399
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,228
昨晚的事
About last night.

400
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,958
你说有人偷袭你是真的吗？
Were you serious about that attack?

401
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,036
不用担心
Don't worry.

402
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,352
是我不好
It was all my fault.

403
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,715
我不应该那么晚了还到处乱跑
I really shouldn't have been out late anyway.

404
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,633
没有人可以阻你
There's nothing to stop you.

405
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,633
因为你是我的客人
You are my guest.

406
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,198
堡主，我知道你不会害我
Lewis. I know you mean me no harm...

407
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,911
但我觉得有人要陷害你
but I'm certain that
someone here is plotting to kill you.

408
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:13,790
真的？
Really?

409
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,513
有谁会做这样的事？
Who would dare to do that?

410
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:26,918
你的手下呢？你有没有怀疑过他们？
What about your staff?
Did you suspect any of them?

411
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,911
告诉我，你为什么会雇用这个管家？
Tell me...why did you employ your valet?

412
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,712
他是不是一早已断了手？
Has he always been handicapped?

413
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,268
为什么这么问？
Why ask about him?

414
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:39,953
这个人有些奇怪
There's something strange about him.

415
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,358
我觉得他值得怀疑
The fact is I suspect him.

416
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,192
他替我工作已有多年
He's been with me for years.

417
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:48,948
以前是个和尚
He used to be a monk.

418
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:50,709
和尚？
A monk?

419
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,917
是梵鱼寺的和尚
Yes, for the Fan Yu Temple.

420
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:56,828
我可’怜他是个废人
I was sorry for him.

421
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,309
所以才收留他
I hired him.

422
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,438
那梵鱼寺在那里？
Where is the Fan Yu Temple?

423
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,793
离这里不远
Quite near here.

424
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,834
传说那里有个死亡塔
There's rumor to be a Tower of Death.

425
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:09,399
但是一直以来都没有人见过这个塔
But then, no one has ever seen this tower.

426
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,389
为什么？
Why is that?

427
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:15,274
我听人说在一百年前
Well, people say hundreds of years ago...

428
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,796
有一位弘光大师，把死亡塔建筑在地底下
An abbot called Hung Kuang built the tower
under the ground.

429
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,116
对不起，李先生，请你出去一会儿
Excuse me, mister. Please leave us for a moment.

430
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,076
我有要事跟堡主商量
I have something to discuss with Master.

431
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,035
你是谁？
Hey, who are you?

432
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:39,959
我的名字叫安琪儿
My name is Angel.

433
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,755
堡主叫我陪陪你
Lewis asked me to come to keep you company.

434
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,230
喝酒吗？
A drink?

435
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,595
谢谢，我不喝酒
No, thanks. Don't touch it.

436
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:52,828
那要不要其他东西？
Something else?

437
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,916
我想休息
A rest. I'm tired.

438
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,149
想杀我？
Want to kill me?

439
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,709
快来人呀，堡主被杀死了
Everyone, quick! Master's been murdered!

440
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,078
他替我工作已有多年
He's been with me for years.

441
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:53,993
以前是个和尚
He was a monk before then.

442
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:55,875
和尚？
A monk?

443
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,871
是梵鱼寺的和尚
Yes, in the Fan Yu Temple

444
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,909
我可＇怜他是个废人，所以才收留他
Felt sorry for him. I hired him.

445
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,070
我听人说在一百年前
People say that hundreds of years ago...

446
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:13,950
有一位弘光大师，把死亡塔建筑在地底下
an abbot called Hung Kuang
built the tower of death. under the ground.

447
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:17,673
堡主叫我陪陪你
Lewis asked me to keep you company.

448
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,153
想杀我？
Do you want to kill me?

449
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,115
你为什么要杀堡主?
Why did you kill Lewis?

450
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,953
这对你有什么好处？假冒为善的人
What do you gain by it?
Funny way of being grateful!

451
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:14,351
你也把秦谷杀了，还嫁祸给堡主
You killed Chin Ku, didn't you...
but you tried to frame Lewis.

452
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,072
究竟你有什么阴谋？
What do you achieve by doing that?

453
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:19,120
行刺我的也是你，对吗？
And you're the one who attacked me, aren't you?

454
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,633
死亡塔在那儿？
Where is the Tower of Death?

455
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:27,718
不要装傻
Don't try to play dumb with me.

456
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:35,393
别说我欺负你这个残废
I'll take a handicap.

457
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,190
让你一只手
Just one hand.

458
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,712
再公平一点，让你两只手
Even fairer, no hands.

459
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:23,239
死亡塔在那儿？带我去
Now where's the Tower of Death? Take me there.

460
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,235
快说
Better speak up.

461
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:27,790
别再耍把戏
I'm tired of playing games with you.

462
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:31,112
说，要不然我就杀了你
Start talking or I'll tear you apart.

463
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:34,478
死亡塔在那里？
Now where's the tower?

464
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:41,635
去死吧
You can go to hell!

465
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,399
我可不怕你
Cause I'm not afraid of you.

466
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:48,079
我这只手会对你不利
I hate to tell you that hand will do you no good.

467
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,473
你是谁？
Hey, who are you?

468
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,389
我？
Me?

469
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:06,788
小偷
Jack the Ripper.

470
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:14,829
你还生存？
You're still alive.

471
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:18,437
当然，有谁能杀得了我？
Of course, I'm alive. No one can defeat me.

472
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,630
你装死究竟是为什么？
But why did you pretend to be dead?

473
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:25,229
你问得太多问题了
You're asking too many questions.

474
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,275
看在你是李振强的弟弟份上
I'll let you go since you're Billy Lo's brother.

475
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:30,158
马上滚
Get out while you can.

476
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:31,629
这是你最后的机会
It's your last chance.

477
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,878
没查出真相之前，我决不会离开
I'm not leaving here till I know the truth!

478
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:38,636
李振国，你最好别再多管闲事
Bobby Lo, you'd better stay out of this.

479
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:40,710
在我改变主意之前滚
Now get out before I change my mind.

480
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:42,559
我哥哥是为了你而死
My brother died for you.

481
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:46,276
他为了保护你的棺材但你却杀害他？
He tried to prevent someone from stealing
your coffin, and you had him killed!

482
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:48,396
你说的不是真的
You're nowhere near to the truth, kid.

483
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,518
我和他的死根本没有关系
I had nothing to do with his death.

484
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,236
我是他的好朋友，为什么要杀他？
He was my good friend. Why should I kill him?

485
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:56,671
对不起，这是他自己找来的
I'm sorry. He brought it on himself.

486
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:58,750
我是个功夫专家
I might be a kung fu expert

487
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:00,349
但我也需要钱呀
but I need cash.

488
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:02,678
毒品生意可以帮我赚到钱
Drug trafficking was my answer.

489
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,750
我可以永远过着奢华的生活
Now I can live in luxury forever.

490
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:10,876
原来你一直是干这卑鄙的事
So you've been in this drug business
for some time.

491
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:12,918
是呀
That's correct, my boy.

492
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:16,837
我想尽办汰，才有今天这个地位
I really had to work hard to get where I am.

493
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,236
再说，毒品这门生意竞争那么激烈
You see there's a lot of competition.

494
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:23,830
我怎会让任何事阻碍我
That's why I won't let anything stand in my way.

495
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,553
你最好现在就离开
If you value your life,
you'd better leave right now.

496
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:31,235
为什么在坟场你又用直升机…
First tell me why you used the chopper...

497
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:32,753
劫走自己的棺材？
to steal your own coffin.

498
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:34,993
很多人已知道
Many people know that

499
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:37,957
我做这门生意
I'm in this business.

500
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:41,518
我不想国际反毒组再查我，所以扮死
I wanted to shake Interpol off my trail.

501
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,116
但我怕他们开棺验尸，所以派人抢走棺材
I was afraid they'd check the coffin.

502
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,191
现在棺材没有了，他们就没证据
Now, they have no evidence.

503
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:11,591
你别以为这样就没事
You won't get away with this!

504
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:14,519
因为我要为我哥哥报仇
Cause I intend to take revenge for my brother!

505
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:20,595
报仇
Take revenge.

506
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,193
只怕你做不到
You're not good enough.

507
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:24,394
你永远也不会打败我
You'll never defeat me.

508
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,592
我就送你上西天，让你们两人见见面
And now I'll be more than happy to let you
join your brother.

509
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:35,678
这是你自己找死
You've asked for it, kid.

510
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:14,593
你这种玩意能吓唬了我吗？
It takes more than that to fight me.

511
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:27,272
秦谷的绝招
Chin Ku's deadly sword.

512
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:29,999
我要用振强的截拳道
I'll have to use Billy's Jeet Kune Do style.
