1
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:51,100
I'm Phoenix. I love the moon

2
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:54,978
Especially when it's full
and most beautiful

3
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:59,246
I don't know why
but my parents are never home...

4
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:06,322
Daddy, Mommy...

5
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,318
I just saw two people fly past the moon

6
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:16,124
You must have been dreaming
People can't fly

7
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:21,873
Too much TV for you!
What an overactive imagination!

8
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,933
No. I really saw it

9
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,442
Tomorrow's a school day

10
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,004
How about a story to put you to sleep?

11
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:33,978
Do you want Mommy to tell you a story
about the Emei Sect of Kung Fu

12
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,784
or Daddy to tell about the 18 Coppermen?

13
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,348
Mommy and Daddy are great storytellers

14
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:44,625
Every story is about
a kung fu master with mystical powers

15
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:48,623
Daddy's 18 Coppermen are especially cute

16
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:54,129
Their stories are fun
but I never believed them...

17
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,267
until one day when I was 14 years old...

18
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,785
Daddy!

19
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:16,387
Mommy!

20
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,333
Relax, don't be scared
I've got to call the police

21
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,208
Where's your parents?

22
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,022
Dad!

23
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,548
Don't be scared, sweetie!

24
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:06,097
We've been searching for
you two for sometime...

25
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:08,205
It's my turn!

26
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:12,969
Attack me...?

27
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,519
Get down! Come down I dare you!

28
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:49,771
Dad!

29
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:53,667
Go to hell!

30
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,183
Awesome Dad! Pretty clever, Phoenix

31
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,553
Mom, why do you suddenly know kung fu?

32
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:10,021
Do you remember that you
once saw people fly past the moon?

33
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,620
That was your Dad and me

34
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:14,428
That's right. Our family has
a natural talent for kung fu

35
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,162
We belong to the
Secret Society of Kung Fu Masters

36
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,692
The Secret Society of Kung Fu Masters?

37
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,972
The ancient and mysterious
world of kung fu

38
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,976
still lives on today

39
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,810
But we don't want to disturb society

40
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:32,181
In secret, we help
the weak and eliminate evildoers

41
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:34,345
We've been chasing
these two for a long time

42
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,117
We never thought they'd pay us visit

43
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,853
Can I learn martial arts too?

44
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,223
Of course you can

45
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,319
Once they turn 14 years old, every child

46
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:46,195
can go to Mount Hua to study
martial arts every summer vacation!

47
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:47,096
Really?

48
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,829
Then I'll be as good as you

49
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,034
You've got the talent

50
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:54,801
One day you'll be better than us

51
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,138
So when can we go?

52
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:58,404
Why not right now?

53
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:11,848
Mom, people are flying across the moon!

54
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:15,888
You brats! A liar just like your father!

55
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,897
I'm not lying

56
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,760
This is Mount Hua

57
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,494
That's right!

58
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,470
I've never flown so high!

59
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:25,924
She's really cool!

60
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,758
She called Rouge
She's the best kung fu student here

61
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:44,271
Time to land

62
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:58,588
Phoenix, this is where
we studied our martial arts

63
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:04,603
Principal of the Academy?

64
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:11,401
Master, you brought
your daughter this time

65
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:15,574
This is Principal of the Academy
the headmaster of the school

66
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,674
Why's he walking backwards?

67
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,043
Kids say the darnedest things
Don't worry about it

68
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:24,022
Long ago, I made a very big mistake

69
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:26,081
I let an evil disciple escape

70
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:30,027
I promised I would bring him to justice

71
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:33,190
Until then I swore to walk backwards

72
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,756
Who's this disciple?

73
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,201
He's No. 1 on our Most Wanted List:
White Eyebrows!

74
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,364
What'd he do wrong?

75
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:43,898
He's committed innumerable crimes

76
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,638
Theft, Murder, Rape

77
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,077
He uses kung fu to hurt ordinary people

78
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:50,082
And he stole our school's
most precious classic

79
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,913
<The Classic of the Nine Negatives>

80
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:58,691
Luckily, for 300 years
no one has deciphered its true meaning

81
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,420
If he ever does, many people will die

82
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,087
Nobody will be able to stop him

83
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,221
Hey, Master

84
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,163
Any news about White Eyebrows?

85
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:10,191
Not yet. But one day

86
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,227
I will arrest him!

87
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,501
Amitabha Buddha

88
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:26,477
Master Grand Grandiloquence
where's Principal of the Academy?

89
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:31,282
In the back Thanks

90
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,617
Principal of the Academy

91
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:36,725
How can I help you?

92
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:37,626
Nothing

93
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:44,364
But... can we date when we grow up?

94
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:47,463
You can't date me
but someone else is fine

95
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:52,500
I mean, can I date someone
who doesn't know martial arts?

96
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,035
Of course, but...

97
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,674
you mustn't let him know
you know martial arts

98
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,414
That sounds pretty difficult

99
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:00,612
You forget about destiny

100
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,679
If the man of your destiny comes along
it's no problem

101
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,315
So who's the man of my destiny?

102
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,758
The man of your destiny is someone...

103
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:13,993
who will only see you
once it's impossible to see you

104
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:19,733
Someone who will only see me
once it's impossible to see me?

105
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,740
Meditate on this

106
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,404
Impossible to see me?

107
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,938
That was my happiest summer vacation ever

108
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:33,247
I learnt many kung fu techniques
I even taught the 18 Coppermen to dance

109
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,638
Everybody liked me

110
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,444
except one...

111
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:09,987
I knew, one day
Rouge and I would have it out

112
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,701
My watch reads 8:58 AM

113
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:26,102
That means everybody
behind me will be late

114
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:39,909
Miss Salina...

115
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:42,853
That tramp Phoenix is in the far back

116
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:43,684
Really?

117
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:49,417
Bitch! She thinks she's so pretty
Just one minute late...

118
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:50,450
and she's fired!

119
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:53,626
Good morning, everyone

120
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:59,127
Downsize! That's my first
order of business at Lam's Group

121
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,732
Too much excess personnel
It's time to slim down

122
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:07,007
Mr. Dragon is our new CEO

123
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:10,846
His main mission is to cut costs

124
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:15,081
Our company has
too many useless secretaries

125
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:21,156
Take for example, Ms. Phoenix

126
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:25,596
Poor educational background
poor experience, poor performance

127
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:30,091
She's useless to the company. We should...

128
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:58,722
We should fire her immediately, right?

129
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:06,629
No. She's so young, so much potential

130
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:10,472
With some training
she could become a model employee

131
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,374
and earn our company lots of money

132
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:17,846
Late again and you're fired

133
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:23,678
Where's that bitch Phoenix? Prepare to die

134
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,087
Ms. Leung, are you looking for me?

135
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,553
When'd you arrive?
Weren't you in line for the elevator?

136
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,223
I had some typing to do, so I came at 8

137
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:37,999
You look tired. Coffee will perk you up

138
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,197
I can't keep that typing waiting

139
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,675
The man of your destiny is someone...

140
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:53,447
who will only see you
once it's impossible to see you

141
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:58,946
Hello

142
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,316
It's your Mom

143
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:05,122
Happy Birthday!
Remember to come home for dinner

144
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:06,596
Have you called Dad?

145
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:09,124
How should I know where he ran off to?

146
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:12,069
He refuses my monthly alimony

147
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,465
He's probably embarrassed
to take money from a woman

148
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,099
What's the big deal?

149
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,838
I make a bundle in real estate
and stock every year

150
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,847
And he's been unemployed for forever

151
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,143
Hasn't he found work in Guangzhou?

152
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:27,485
How should I know?
He doesn't even have a cell phone

153
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,784
Forget about him

154
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:32,484
There's plenty time to talk at dinner, OK?

155
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:33,548
OK, bye

156
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,852
Why are you sitting here all by yourself?

157
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:41,964
Today's been a strange day

158
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,060
How strange?

159
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:47,072
During the meeting
I was standing by the window

160
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,937
When suddenly outside
appeared a young woman

161
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:51,704
Then... she climbed up the window
like a spider

162
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,211
And disappeared

163
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:58,075
Pretty high. Must have hurt falling down

164
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,881
But she didn't fall. She climbed inside

165
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,717
She's a secretary here, named Phoenix

166
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,224
So what was it? Skirt or pants?

167
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,318
A skirt

168
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,228
That means no pants. Quite a sight, eh?

169
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:15,196
Stop joking. Do you believe me?

170
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,596
Excuse me? What does
all these about believe you?

171
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,194
What kind of friends are we?

172
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,899
Kindergarten, primary,
secondary, university...

173
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:21,997
we were classmates through it all

174
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,067
The girls you didn't like
I helped you seduce

175
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,304
The girls you did like
I seduced behind your back

176
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:28,006
What kind of friendship is that? Huh?

177
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,743
Give me your hand...

178
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:35,385
Friends to the End, you got it?

179
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,151
So you believe me?

180
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,215
Of course... not!

181
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,519
Mr. Dragon, your new secretary is here

182
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,129
It's her...

183
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,262
You... you tell her to leave

184
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:53,794
Tell her to leave? No way!

185
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,740
Beautiful and can crawl up windows?

186
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:57,707
Tell her to get out of here!

187
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,142
If you don't want, I want

188
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:05,447
Excuse me Ms., but I'm afraid
you're too pretty to be my secretary

189
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:06,508
Don't worry

190
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:09,350
Tomorrow I won't wear make up
I promise to be ugly

191
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,946
You can call me by
my English name: Phoenix

192
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:12,547
If you want anything, just let me know

193
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,050
Please climb a window

194
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:15,924
Excuse me?

195
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,895
He said you can climb windows!

196
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:21,695
I'm a secretary, not a window cleaner

197
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,098
Just joking

198
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,729
I'm Kiddie Kim, his best friend

199
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,171
Of course Kiddie Kim is
Dragon's best friend

200
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:32,176
Please bring us two coffees

201
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,304
No problem. Anything else just instruct

202
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,410
I don't care. I'll give you fifty... No...

203
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,747
You give me fifty thousand
I'll take her off your hands

204
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:43,380
No. I really saw her
climbing up the window

205
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:48,417
I can only imagine... her
climbing onto the bed

206
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,424
Cool down, will you?

207
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,023
Impossible. I can't help myself

208
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:55,923
So pretty

209
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,369
Here you go again...

210
00:18:58,403 --> 00:18:59,529
Get your mind out of the bedroom...

211
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:06,270
Stop it...

212
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:08,812
Do I need to step out?

213
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:14,246
You two are busy?

214
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:18,017
No. Dragon and I were
discussing some contractual matters

215
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,956
Yes You should consider him

216
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,254
OK

217
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:25,096
The affairs of the day call
I can't let work wait

218
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,223
Back to work Back to work...

219
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,100
Back to work

220
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,298
Boss, you were looking for me?

221
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,739
Yes, I need you
to represent me at a dinner

222
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:37,707
What dinner?

223
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,472
Having dinner with some business friends

224
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,912
They want to discuss
how to boycott Boss White

225
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,813
Boss White? The Stock Killer?

226
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,578
That's right

227
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:48,051
They think he's
too power hungry and immoral

228
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:51,021
I'm not one to quarrel with people

229
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:53,786
So I'd rather not attend

230
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,452
But if I don't go
I might offend the others

231
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,655
So I want you to represent me

232
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:01,757
Plus, my daughter graduated
and is returning from the USA

233
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,701
Family comes first. You can trust me

234
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:05,794
Great

235
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:11,638
You two, just a second ago...
what do you call that position?

236
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:20,941
Mom, I'm back

237
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,681
I'm in the kitchen

238
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,123
Chicken with shark's fin

239
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,536
That sucks!

240
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:41,264
Phoenix, why'd you beat up Brother Wai?

241
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,399
I saw a man. I thought he was a thief

242
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:46,172
He's my client. I invited him to dinner

243
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:48,702
Look, you practically killed him

244
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,977
Nothing acupressure on
his pleasure points can't cure

245
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:00,417
What a feeling! What a high!

246
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,593
Did someone just hit me?

247
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,096
No

248
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,724
Just a happy hour
You got drunk and started hallucinating

249
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:08,858
Come on... let me introduce you

250
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,458
This is my daughter Phoenix

251
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,832
Hello, Phoenix

252
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:16,670
Hello! Call me Little Willy

253
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:17,640
You that small?

254
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:18,938
Yes Phoenix

255
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:23,676
Brother Wai just bought a luxury car
He'll take you out for a spin

256
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,445
Mom, we've got to talk

257
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,114
Take your time

258
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:34,855
Who are you introducing to me this time?

259
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:39,296
Brother Wai's rich
I helped him buy several luxury flats

260
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,822
I earned over a million
in commission alone

261
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:44,995
Please don't set me up with more ugly men

262
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:48,063
The handsome ones are unreliable and poor

263
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,164
Look at your Dad

264
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:51,903
A business failure. Totally unreliable

265
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,137
But Dad's a kung fu master

266
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:55,840
Is kung fu going to feed you?

267
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:58,179
I'm no slouch at kung fu either

268
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:01,447
But if not for real estate and stocks
where would I be today?

269
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:05,217
Mom. I think I found the man of my destiny

270
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:08,954
Phoenix, don't believe that silly monk

271
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,462
Burglar...

272
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,364
My little sweetie!

273
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:18,460
Dad...

274
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,599
I must come back
to celebrate your birthday

275
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,834
I missed you. How is it going lately?

276
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:23,772
Great as always

277
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:28,508
I call the shots at the zoo now
I'm the COOO

278
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,037
What does that mean?

279
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,743
It's very technical
You wouldn't understand

280
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,445
Who is he? How'd he come
in from the balcony?

281
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,250
He's my ex-husband. lgnore him

282
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,015
Who's the bastard?

283
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:42,322
Phoenix's boyfriend

284
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:44,489
Mom invited him

285
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,594
You're...?

286
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:51,659
Some call me Buddy Billy
But Handsome Wai is fine

287
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,965
I think you got something on your back

288
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:53,766
Really?

289
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:56,472
What? Still looking

290
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,069
He's got something on his back!

291
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:02,080
Nothing

292
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,107
Sweetie, Dad brought you a birthday gift

293
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,049
I know you'll love it

294
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:08,211
What is it?

295
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:09,948
A secret. I'll show you later

296
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:12,548
Phoenix, Brother Wai has
a birthday gift too. Take it out

297
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:13,580
A watch. Very expensive

298
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:17,694
Fake! Broken?

299
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:22,922
Tomorrow... So you think I'm pretty?

300
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,663
I'll get it fixed tomorrow
Yes, very pretty

301
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,465
Keep looking Very beautiful

302
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,212
Had your fill?

303
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,355
I have to take a piss

304
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:56,701
Stop fighting

305
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,633
Who?

306
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:00,332
Brother Wai?

307
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:03,771
A monster!

308
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:06,572
What monster? A hawk!

309
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,341
It's my birthday gift to my sweetie

310
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:10,973
He's over 1000 years old

311
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,678
His previous masters were
Yeung and Dragon Girl

312
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:18,178
I worked like hell to teach him
how to use the toilet

313
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,784
You teach him to look at women too?

314
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:21,952
He's so cute

315
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,460
Can I keep him, Mom?

316
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:28,466
This apartment doesn't even allow dogs

317
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,400
I'll keep him by my side

318
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:31,367
What about Brother Wai?

319
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:32,597
Keep him by your side

320
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,333
Oh, forget about it

321
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,398
Same old attitude

322
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:41,640
All these years and
she hasn't changed. lgnore her

323
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,772
Hawk

324
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,783
Phoenix is your master now
Do what she says

325
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,876
He learns quickly and eats anything

326
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,319
But hide your valuables
otherwise he'll eat them

327
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:51,617
He can understand what people say?

328
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,954
More than that. He even knows English

329
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:57,223
Here is my phone number
Call me if it's urgent

330
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:58,593
But don't visit me

331
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,827
My job's too important
and busy for personal matters

332
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:05,701
Also, White Eyebrows has appeared again

333
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:10,003
Every kung fu master is on 24-hour alert

334
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:13,135
Rumor is that he's learned
the Classic of the Nine Negatives

335
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,807
If you run into him
don't try to be a hero

336
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,646
One word: Run!

337
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,652
I don't bother myself with such nonsense

338
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,210
Can you play Mahjong?

339
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:44,403
Mr. Dragon, is this
your first time playing Mahjong?

340
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:45,739
No

341
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:49,338
It's my first time playing Mahjong
while being massaged

342
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,015
Your boss loves it

343
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,487
My turn Stop... stop touching me

344
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:58,614
I got a pair

345
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:02,252
Boss White has become really greedy

346
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:06,162
I bought some land in the mountains
He demanded to be my partner

347
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:07,221
I refused

348
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:11,429
The next day, someone broke
my son's legs on his way to school

349
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:12,401
Last month

350
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:16,498
he demanded to buy
one of my buildings. I refused

351
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:21,342
Every day now, someone there
gets injured and hospitalized

352
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:24,780
He visited my home once
and took a liking to it

353
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:28,616
He wanted to buy it. I refused to sell

354
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:32,589
Mysteriously, the next day
my family woke up in a cemetery

355
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:34,251
I'm luckier than you

356
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:35,657
What has he done to you...?

357
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:36,956
I've never met him

358
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:41,129
We should band together to boycott him

359
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:43,095
I play West

360
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:46,331
I win! All four reborn in
Western Paradise! Bad luck...!

361
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:10,552
Hey! Let me go!

362
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:14,631
You're dead! Stop massaging me!

363
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:30,007
Hawk, you know
how to use the remote control?

364
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:37,444
Sir, can you tell me what happened

365
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:41,016
What?

366
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,963
They slaughtered everyone

367
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:57,726
I'm so scared. They are cruel

368
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,103
They killed everyone

369
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:02,504
They came in and slaughtered everyone

370
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:09,344
Poor guy. He ran into
some evil kung fu masters

371
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:11,706
They even flew

372
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:16,583
Who will believe
his fantastic story? So sad

373
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:20,049
It's not sad. It's stupid

374
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:25,455
Once they see him on TV
they'll try to kill him again

375
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,931
No. I must save him

376
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:30,696
Phoenix, do you know this guy?

377
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:32,999
I think he's the man of my destiny

378
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:34,834
You remember, someone...

379
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:37,364
who won't see me
until it's impossible to see me

380
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:41,212
Don't believe that monk's nonsense

381
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:44,079
Listen to me, Brother Wai is...

382
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,777
Listen to me, I have to go now

383
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:47,910
Hawk, let's go

384
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,044
Let's go, stop watching TV

385
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,617
So stubborn

386
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:55,820
The most important is...
they weren't human!

387
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:56,151
This is a small punishment
Kill him immediately, if not...

388
00:30:56,187 --> 00:31:00,920
you'll feel the wrath of the 9th Negative

389
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,051
Yes, master

390
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:10,991
We're friends to the end

391
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:18,265
My underwear is yours. Yours is mine

392
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:19,241
But this time...

393
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:22,337
This time I can't believe you, brother

394
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,745
You don't believe me?

395
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:26,649
Then how do you explain it?

396
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:31,348
Gang revenge or terrorist attack
maybe. But you're saying...

397
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:35,018
No. That man and woman
were really superhuman

398
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:39,587
His hand was like a knife
her leg was like a drill

399
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:43,229
Are you hallucinating?

400
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:46,494
Where's your wallet?

401
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:48,402
Under the pillow. Why?

402
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:53,705
What're you doing?

403
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:57,078
Everything you see is unreal

404
00:31:57,115 --> 00:32:00,642
Everything is a hallucination...

405
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:03,013
Give me back my money!

406
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:04,487
What money?

407
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:06,948
The money you stole!

408
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:12,356
You have no money
except what I lent to you

409
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:13,796
Here, take $100 more

410
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:18,099
Shit... your hallucinations
are really serious

411
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:21,196
Rest up. I'll see you soon

412
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:34,249
I'll return $100 to you next week

413
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:39,318
Hi, I'm the reporter of
Daily Oriental, please...

414
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:41,621
Which room is Mr. Dragon in?

415
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:44,853
No way

416
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:49,424
Of course you're
more important than Dragon

417
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:52,831
Yes, I'll come back tonight, don't worry

418
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,667
Hi Hi

419
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:57,436
Dad, we'll talk later tonight

420
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:01,837
I'm a reporter
Are you Mr. Dragon's friend?

421
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:03,506
Yes... What's the matter?

422
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:06,449
I want to interview him
but the hospital won't let me

423
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:09,181
How can they treat
a beautiful woman like this?

424
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,211
They're simply inhuman

425
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:13,723
Exactly. If I don't get this interview

426
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:16,750
my boss will fire me

427
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:18,455
Of course maybe if you help me...

428
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:19,861
No problem

429
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:23,632
There's a quiet place over there

430
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:24,828
where we can get to know each other

431
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:26,166
You're very kind

432
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:37,275
Our Tendon-Bending Technique
has 18 steps in all

433
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,806
That was number 6

434
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,149
You still have 12 to go
You think you can handle it?

435
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:03,471
Why am I always seeing things
that I shouldn't see?

436
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:08,369
Who are you?

437
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:10,371
What're you doing?

438
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:25,958
Let's go

439
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:55,519
What the hell?

440
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,460
A hawk Hawk?

441
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,497
More hallucinations!

442
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:11,902
An arrow! Fly!

443
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,446
Hawk, are you OK?

444
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,212
I'm not OK

445
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:22,685
Shit! He's hit with
a poison arrow. Hurry home!

446
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:33,791
Damn! It's a centipede arrow
No medicine can save him

447
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:35,822
Kung fu is only hope

448
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:40,998
But to eliminate the poison
I can't wear any clothes

449
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:44,439
If I'm not strong enough
the poison will kill us both

450
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:47,769
If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die

451
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,496
What're you doing?

452
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:50,238
Mom

453
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:52,401
This setup is even
suitable for a kid's film

454
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:54,741
He can't see a thing. What's the big fuss?

455
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:58,848
In the past, if a woman
removed poison like this

456
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,851
she had to marry the guy

457
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,076
What century is this?

458
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,351
If that were true, all women
would have to marry their gynecologist

459
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,154
Put some clothes on. I want to talk to you

460
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:27,207
Phoenix, this guy is in deep trouble

461
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,373
Those killers won't let him go

462
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,144
If they were as good
at kung fu as you said

463
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:36,551
then they must work for White Eyebrows

464
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:41,752
I've retired from martial arts
You should too

465
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,522
It's OK if you don't help Dragon
but you can't stop me

466
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:46,496
I'm afraid you'll get into trouble

467
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,760
I'm not scared Well, I'm scared

468
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,699
Mom, be reasonable

469
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:53,499
Fine, tomorrow take him somewhere else

470
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:55,164
I won't let him stay here

471
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:57,436
Tomorrow I'll find him
a safe place to hide

472
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,739
What place is safe?

473
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:03,372
These killers would even bust
into a police station

474
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:04,745
Don't worry about me

475
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,613
Anyway, he won't stay
no more than 12 hours

476
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,885
Fine, when midnight comes

477
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:13,446
I'm kicking him out

478
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:16,756
Listen close: I won't protect him

479
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:19,389
Hawk will protect him

480
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:25,527
Phoenix. Wake up please

481
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:27,969
This is the year 2006

482
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:30,200
This isn't the world of kung fu

483
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:36,303
I believe you're the man of my destiny

484
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:39,012
So I must save you

485
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:44,252
Before I come back, please don't leave

486
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:45,255
OK?

487
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:56,064
Excuse me, I want to find Dad

488
00:38:56,101 --> 00:38:57,033
Who?

489
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:58,729
He's the COOO of the zoo

490
00:38:58,770 --> 00:38:59,998
There's no such a position here

491
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:02,063
You'd better go in and ask around

492
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:08,370
Brush your teeth...

493
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:12,713
Brush the upper, brush the lower
brush the left, brush the right...

494
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,377
What the hell? You bastard

495
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,587
Bastard...

496
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:21,986
Bastard

497
00:39:23,295 --> 00:39:24,421
Hey, where's my watch?

498
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,695
In your stomach again?

499
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:29,030
Open up!

500
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,536
It's not mine

501
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:37,132
But it's a Rolex, so forget about it

502
00:39:38,076 --> 00:39:39,008
Uncle Itchiban

503
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:42,442
Phoenix, what brings you here?

504
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,573
I'm looking for my Dad

505
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:46,277
Your... your Dad?

506
00:39:47,953 --> 00:39:48,783
Look out!

507
00:39:50,255 --> 00:39:50,778
Have you forgotten?

508
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:53,689
They can't bite through
my Metal Skin Technique

509
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:00,388
Uncle Itchiban

510
00:40:00,432 --> 00:40:03,401
My Dad said he's the COOO
A very important position

511
00:40:03,435 --> 00:40:05,096
But why does nobody know him?

512
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:07,127
Uh, your Dad...

513
00:40:07,172 --> 00:40:08,935
Pork Chop Dad? He's by the toilet

514
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,497
Dad, don't go

515
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:43,540
What were all these
you said about being COOO?

516
00:40:43,575 --> 00:40:45,099
COOO means...

517
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:47,703
Chief Outhouse Only Officer

518
00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:51,978
Sweetie, sorry, I lied

519
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,982
Never mind, Dad

520
00:40:58,023 --> 00:41:00,287
You earn your own living

521
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:02,623
I don't care no matter what you do

522
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:07,027
Sweetie

523
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:10,761
Dad's useless. I'm not a businessman

524
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:14,135
I can't provide my family
with a luxurious lifestyle

525
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:16,163
The most important thing is that
a family is together

526
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,641
Unfortunately, your Mom doesn't think so

527
00:41:18,677 --> 00:41:21,237
One day, Mom will understand

528
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:22,678
What brings you here?

529
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:25,846
I think...

530
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:29,115
I've found the man of my destiny

531
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:31,088
Who is it?

532
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:32,919
He's my boss. His name is Dragon

533
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,447
Some more toilet paper please

534
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,756
Go squat on the can
and I'll bring it in a minute, OK?

535
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:42,296
He must be a talented guy
When can I see him?

536
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:47,100
Kung fu killers are chasing him
Mom won't help

537
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:48,503
That bitch never helps

538
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:50,904
Don't blame Mom

539
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:52,273
Never mind. I'll go back with you

540
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,368
to protect your love

541
00:41:54,779 --> 00:41:58,875
Excuse me ladies
can you tell me where I am?

542
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:04,554
Why do you tease me
with skimpy outfits and feather boas?

543
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:15,725
Monster dog!

544
00:42:16,468 --> 00:42:18,629
(I'm not a dog. I'm a majestic hawk)

545
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,072
Ouch! What happened to my butt?

546
00:42:24,843 --> 00:42:26,640
(You were hit with a poison arrow)

547
00:42:28,413 --> 00:42:28,902
Where's Phoenix?

548
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,515
(She went to find you a bodyguard)

549
00:42:33,518 --> 00:42:35,645
It's after 9. I have to be at the office

550
00:42:35,687 --> 00:42:38,417
(Impossible)

551
00:42:38,456 --> 00:42:40,924
Impossible but not impassable!

552
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:46,820
(Go back to bed like a good boy)

553
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,301
Have you ever seen a fist this big?

554
00:42:52,337 --> 00:42:55,033
One punch will send you back to the zoo

555
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:26,897
Brother hawk, good TV programme?

556
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:31,801
(Show me your hand!)

557
00:43:33,244 --> 00:43:34,176
(The other hand)

558
00:43:39,217 --> 00:43:40,514
(Both hands!)

559
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:46,523
Nothing in the left, nothing in the right

560
00:43:46,558 --> 00:43:48,549
Nothing on the backs, nothing in the palms

561
00:43:49,427 --> 00:43:50,860
Come on, give me five

562
00:43:57,202 --> 00:43:59,136
Hello, 999 Emergency Hotline

563
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:02,367
I've been kidnapped
Please call the swat team to save me

564
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:03,101
Sir

565
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:04,472
What is your location?

566
00:44:04,609 --> 00:44:05,576
And who is your kidnapper?

567
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,043
I don't know the location

568
00:44:07,078 --> 00:44:09,740
but I've been kidnapped by a bird
He says he's a hawk

569
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:14,141
You said you've been kidnapped by a hawk?

570
00:44:14,853 --> 00:44:15,478
That's right

571
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,047
Perhaps I should transfer your call
to the Wildlife Conservation Department

572
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:20,853
or to a mental hospital

573
00:44:20,892 --> 00:44:22,416
Thank you for your call, bye

574
00:44:30,902 --> 00:44:33,336
It's nothing. I was bored

575
00:44:33,371 --> 00:44:36,534
So I dialed 1 731 731 73

576
00:44:36,574 --> 00:44:37,336
Hello

577
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:48,481
Lucky... not hurt...

578
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,884
Maybe not

579
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:53,185
Sorry...

580
00:44:53,224 --> 00:44:56,455
If you want to leave
just climb out the window

581
00:44:56,494 --> 00:44:58,758
I've got the rope ready for you

582
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:01,060
Just climb down to the street

583
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:03,661
What's your name, Ms.?

584
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:07,603
My name is Dolina, Phoenix's mom

585
00:45:08,306 --> 00:45:09,102
Thank you

586
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:15,702
Ms. Do... Dolina

587
00:45:15,747 --> 00:45:19,205
This is the 10th floor
I haven't prepared a parachute

588
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,808
You'll be late for work

589
00:45:20,852 --> 00:45:21,841
Thank you, Ms.

590
00:45:36,334 --> 00:45:38,029
Hawk, where's Dragon?

591
00:45:40,138 --> 00:45:42,572
Gone Mom!

592
00:45:42,607 --> 00:45:45,633
He's got feet. He can walk
if he wants. None of my business

593
00:45:45,677 --> 00:45:46,609
What do we do, sweetie?

594
00:45:47,378 --> 00:45:48,868
He's a workaholic
He probably went to the office

595
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:50,608
We'll find him there, Dad

596
00:45:50,648 --> 00:45:52,377
You, bad bird!

597
00:45:58,957 --> 00:46:00,652
What's wrong with you?

598
00:46:00,692 --> 00:46:02,489
You're alright! You haven't died...

599
00:46:03,528 --> 00:46:05,928
My butt was hit with a poison arrow

600
00:46:05,964 --> 00:46:08,364
and I was kidnapped by a dog
that looks like a hawk

601
00:46:08,399 --> 00:46:10,731
I thought that man and woman killed you

602
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,793
Those two used the
Tendon-Bending Technique...

603
00:46:12,837 --> 00:46:15,362
to snap all the joints in my body. Look!

604
00:46:16,474 --> 00:46:19,068
Those were the killers
from the Emperor's Club

605
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,168
No way!

606
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:23,641
Where've you two been?
The boss is looking for you

607
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:25,611
Let's go

608
00:46:28,052 --> 00:46:28,814
Boss

609
00:46:29,821 --> 00:46:31,652
Why are you two walking like clowns?

610
00:46:31,689 --> 00:46:33,748
The police are looking for you

611
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:34,382
Boss

612
00:46:34,425 --> 00:46:37,019
I almost didn't make it to work
A hawk kidnapped me

613
00:46:37,061 --> 00:46:38,028
Hawk yourself!

614
00:46:38,062 --> 00:46:41,589
Go find Commissioner Lee right away
Don't get the company into trouble

615
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,461
This would have never happened
if I didn't represent you at that dinner

616
00:46:46,504 --> 00:46:47,766
Why you... Dad...

617
00:47:06,257 --> 00:47:07,747
Let me introduce you

618
00:47:07,792 --> 00:47:12,195
Mr. Kiddie Kim is our Development Manager
Mr. Dragon is our CEO

619
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:14,790
He's one unfortunate CEO though

620
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:18,393
Two crazies cut his butt to pieces

621
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:25,204
You're destined to meet...

622
00:47:25,243 --> 00:47:27,973
a man injured in both buttocks

623
00:47:32,383 --> 00:47:35,546
I'm Rouge. This is my mom, Bo Jeannie

624
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:37,579
Mrs. Lam Mrs. Lam

625
00:47:37,622 --> 00:47:40,716
My wife was in the USA with my daughter
while she was studying

626
00:47:40,758 --> 00:47:45,821
You two take a vacation
With my daughter's help, I don't need you

627
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:48,024
Dad, how can you do that?

628
00:47:48,066 --> 00:47:50,626
I've just come back to work
I need Mr. Dragon

629
00:47:50,668 --> 00:47:52,795
to explain to me the company's situation!

630
00:47:52,837 --> 00:47:55,704
Mr. Dragon, let's talk over some drinks

631
00:47:58,376 --> 00:47:59,673
So headstrong

632
00:48:00,745 --> 00:48:02,975
This really happened?

633
00:48:03,014 --> 00:48:06,677
If it didn't happen to me
I wouldn't believe it either

634
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,777
It's like some kind of kung fu novel

635
00:48:09,821 --> 00:48:12,255
I think I need to go into hiding

636
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:14,183
What a coincidence!

637
00:48:22,467 --> 00:48:23,900
This is my father

638
00:48:24,969 --> 00:48:27,130
She's my secretary Phoenix

639
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:36,237
I have to go to the rest room

640
00:48:39,183 --> 00:48:40,241
I also need to go

641
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,287
Uncle, are you overly friendly
or just near-sighted?

642
00:48:46,324 --> 00:48:49,953
An outstanding man
My daughter has good taste

643
00:48:49,994 --> 00:48:52,827
I don't quite understand

644
00:48:52,864 --> 00:48:55,424
My daughter risked her life for you

645
00:48:55,466 --> 00:48:57,195
You must love and cherish her

646
00:48:58,236 --> 00:49:00,295
I think I need to explain
No explanations!

647
00:49:00,338 --> 00:49:01,236
Have you ever slept with a prostitute?

648
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:01,863
No!

649
00:49:01,906 --> 00:49:02,804
Have you had a one-night stand?

650
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,602
Of course not!

651
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:04,608
Are you gay?

652
00:49:04,642 --> 00:49:06,473
Of course not! Uncle
what are you talking about?

653
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:10,705
I can rest at ease then

654
00:49:13,918 --> 00:49:14,885
You're Phoenix

655
00:49:14,919 --> 00:49:18,013
You're Rouge! I never thought
you were the Boss' daughter

656
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:22,216
He's my stepfather. After Mom married him

657
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,955
we went to USA

658
00:49:23,995 --> 00:49:26,896
So I haven't gone to
Mount Hua for a long time

659
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:30,525
Dragon is destined for me
Don't touch him!

660
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:34,968
What century is this?
You still believe in destiny?

661
00:49:35,006 --> 00:49:38,601
If I like a boy, I won't let him go

662
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:39,632
Oh that's right

663
00:49:39,677 --> 00:49:42,475
When you were studying martial arts

664
00:49:42,513 --> 00:49:44,572
all you knew how to do was
compete with others

665
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:50,010
You think you can beat me?
You never beat on Mount Hua

666
00:49:51,222 --> 00:49:54,214
Mount Hua? This is Hong Kong!

667
00:49:56,794 --> 00:49:58,056
Let's put it to the test then!

668
00:51:20,945 --> 00:51:23,140
Miss, this is male rest room

669
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,910
You're quite pretty
Don't worry. There's room for two

670
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:28,383
Read your newspaper!

671
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:44,094
You can't beat me. Give up?

672
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,598
I won't give up Dragon!
He's destined for me!

673
00:51:52,643 --> 00:51:53,575
Uncle, excuse me

674
00:51:55,413 --> 00:51:56,710
What did your grandpa do?

675
00:51:56,747 --> 00:51:58,146
You want to investigate my whole family?

676
00:51:58,182 --> 00:51:59,171
Has your grandpa
ever slept with a prostitute?

677
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:00,114
No

678
00:52:01,786 --> 00:52:03,048
Has your grandpa
ever had a one-night stand?

679
00:52:03,087 --> 00:52:04,213
No!

680
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:09,358
Is your grandpa gay?

681
00:52:09,393 --> 00:52:12,521
No...! All my ancestors are NO!

682
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:15,496
Miss Rouge

683
00:52:18,169 --> 00:52:18,931
Miss Rouge

684
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:22,166
The faucet broke
She's going home for a shower

685
00:52:22,206 --> 00:52:23,969
So, why didn't you get wet?

686
00:52:26,043 --> 00:52:28,307
Why don't you tell me
what really happened?

687
00:52:28,346 --> 00:52:30,940
OK, then you'll know
the kind of danger you're really in

688
00:52:36,787 --> 00:52:39,813
Jenny, I thought you'd forgotten me

689
00:52:42,026 --> 00:52:43,857
I have forgotten you

690
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:46,829
So... why have you come to see me?

691
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:50,929
I know you're competing against my husband

692
00:52:50,968 --> 00:52:54,335
And trying to kill one of his employees

693
00:52:54,372 --> 00:52:59,366
Yes. I don't want anybody
to discover my identity

694
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,901
Then just reform yourself, White Eyebrows!

695
00:53:02,747 --> 00:53:03,941
Reform?

696
00:53:06,751 --> 00:53:08,616
You listen close

697
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:14,056
in my dictionary
there's no such word as reform

698
00:53:14,091 --> 00:53:17,788
You've used your kung fu
to kill many people

699
00:53:17,828 --> 00:53:19,921
All so you could become a tycoon

700
00:53:19,964 --> 00:53:23,491
You now have enough money
for four lifetimes

701
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:25,058
What left for you to compete for?

702
00:53:25,102 --> 00:53:28,230
No one can ever have too much money

703
00:53:28,272 --> 00:53:32,208
What I hate most is people
who think they can compete with me

704
00:53:34,111 --> 00:53:37,308
Our relationship ended long ago

705
00:53:37,348 --> 00:53:41,580
You nearly made me
the enemy of the entire kung fu world

706
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:45,988
I decided to leave kung fu
and never see you again

707
00:53:46,023 --> 00:53:50,323
I never expected
you'd become a businessman

708
00:53:50,361 --> 00:53:54,855
Too bad, your personality hasn't changed

709
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:57,060
Why should I change?

710
00:53:58,269 --> 00:54:01,830
I plan to devour
all the richest of the rich

711
00:54:01,872 --> 00:54:06,070
and become the wealthiest man in Asia

712
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:08,271
You're dreaming!

713
00:54:08,312 --> 00:54:10,803
Keep dreaming, and I'll tell
Principal of the Academy

714
00:54:10,848 --> 00:54:13,976
You can tell the entire world of
kung fu. I'm not afraid

715
00:54:14,018 --> 00:54:15,485
What arrogance!

716
00:54:16,454 --> 00:54:17,512
You don't believe me?

717
00:54:21,826 --> 00:54:23,418
For 300 years

718
00:54:23,461 --> 00:54:27,659
nobody learned the
secret of the 9th Negative

719
00:54:27,698 --> 00:54:30,997
because it's written in English!

720
00:54:31,836 --> 00:54:36,637
Luckily, I happened to know
a good English teacher

721
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:41,367
No one can beat me

722
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:45,671
OK. I believe you. But...

723
00:54:47,051 --> 00:54:51,078
But what can I do? Call the police!

724
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:54,186
The police can't help you

725
00:54:54,225 --> 00:54:55,954
I asked Dad to protect you

726
00:54:55,993 --> 00:54:56,857
Dad?

727
00:54:57,495 --> 00:54:58,553
Yours truly

728
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:00,560
You all by yourself?

729
00:55:00,598 --> 00:55:04,125
Along with my martial arts techniques
and my friend Itchiban

730
00:55:04,168 --> 00:55:05,965
You couldn't do any better

731
00:55:07,605 --> 00:55:10,506
If Uncle follows me around all day
it'll be a real eyesore

732
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:12,133
Don't worry. I've got a plan

733
00:55:22,286 --> 00:55:23,014
What're you doing?

734
00:55:47,044 --> 00:55:48,773
What're you doing?

735
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:51,280
Son-in-law, we're here to protect you

736
00:55:51,315 --> 00:55:53,647
Don't forget. The enemy could be anywhere

737
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:55,379
Don't call me son-in-law

738
00:55:55,419 --> 00:55:57,887
But you are my son-in-law!

739
00:55:57,922 --> 00:55:59,890
Some things can't be forced

740
00:56:00,324 --> 00:56:02,884
If you're not my son-in-law
why should I protect you?

741
00:56:02,927 --> 00:56:03,825
Let's go

742
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:08,431
Stop! Father-in-law

743
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:11,662
Again Father-in-law

744
00:56:13,437 --> 00:56:16,804
The kid learns fast. We won't abandon you

745
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:17,898
Dragon...

746
00:56:24,815 --> 00:56:26,043
He's safe

747
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:28,909
Who... who are you two?

748
00:56:28,953 --> 00:56:30,352
Bodyguards...

749
00:56:33,324 --> 00:56:35,918
Dra... Dragon, Mrs. Lam asked for you

750
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,222
Mrs. Lam asked for me?

751
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:42,421
Mrs. Lam, you called for me?

752
00:56:44,034 --> 00:56:45,831
Dragon

753
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:48,667
My computer died. Can you take a look?

754
00:56:48,706 --> 00:56:49,536
OK

755
00:57:05,189 --> 00:57:06,884
OK. No pro...

756
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:09,916
Thank you

757
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,391
Why were you trying to use
the Death Touch on Dragon?

758
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:20,836
One touch and in one hour
all his blood vessels would burst

759
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:22,429
Don't try to stop me

760
00:57:22,473 --> 00:57:26,910
But I believe he's the man of my destiny

761
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:28,707
I must kill him

762
00:57:28,746 --> 00:57:30,714
Why?

763
00:57:30,748 --> 00:57:34,514
Your father White Eyebrows
has learned the 9th Negative

764
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:38,419
Yesterday I just saw
how great his power was

765
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:41,947
Nobody can stop him now

766
00:57:41,992 --> 00:57:46,986
He's forcing me to kill
Dragon and your stepfather

767
00:57:47,031 --> 00:57:51,798
And give him your
stepfather's wealth. If I don't...

768
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:53,132
then he will kill you

769
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:56,303
He's heartless

770
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:03,412
He's capable of anything

771
00:58:04,248 --> 00:58:06,546
I have to do as he says

772
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:09,245
You can't kill my stepfather

773
00:58:10,788 --> 00:58:14,349
But how can I sit by and let him kill you?

774
00:58:15,693 --> 00:58:17,092
What can we do?

775
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:20,619
Dad treats us so well
How can we do this to him?

776
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:22,859
But I've no choice

777
00:58:32,042 --> 00:58:32,872
Why are you two crying?

778
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,811
It's nothing

779
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:36,642
It's because...

780
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,581
we were talking about
this poor woman on a TV soap opera

781
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:41,777
We got all emotional and began to cry

782
00:58:42,653 --> 00:58:46,919
Silly women. TV is fake
There's no need to cry

783
00:58:46,957 --> 00:58:48,049
That's right

784
00:58:48,892 --> 00:58:52,521
Your birthday is in two days
Let's do something fun

785
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:54,925
How about a pool party?

786
00:58:54,965 --> 00:58:57,126
Great! Good idea

787
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:13,673
Hot...

788
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:16,117
You're so hot, you'll
catch a fever. Better cool down...

789
00:59:22,593 --> 00:59:24,060
Food is here...

790
00:59:24,094 --> 00:59:25,994
Take a bite. Am I a good BBQ chef?

791
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:29,699
OK...

792
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:32,827
Boss is here. Time to cut the cake

793
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:34,599
Boss White has arrived Cut the cake

794
00:59:39,243 --> 00:59:40,608
Why is he here?

795
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:43,541
Honey, I invited Mr. White

796
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:47,346
I figured this was a good chance
to relax and to solve your dispute

797
00:59:59,496 --> 01:00:02,363
Congratulations, Mr. Lam. Happy birthday

798
01:00:02,399 --> 01:00:03,195
Thank you

799
01:00:03,867 --> 01:00:07,894
So it's a pool party

800
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:08,734
Right

801
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:11,332
Too bad. I forgot
to bring my swimming suit

802
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:13,400
Never mind. I'll lend you a pair

803
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:15,811
How could I fill your shorts?

804
01:00:17,748 --> 01:00:21,240
Mr. White, I haven't seen you
for a long time. Welcome

805
01:00:21,285 --> 01:00:22,843
Taken alone, this medicine is non-toxic

806
01:00:22,886 --> 01:00:25,150
But if you take it with alcohol

807
01:00:25,189 --> 01:00:27,123
then you'll die peacefully

808
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:30,226
This is your daughter?

809
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:31,249
Yes...

810
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:33,354
Rouge, say hi to Uncle White

811
01:00:34,198 --> 01:00:35,290
Hi, Uncle White

812
01:00:35,332 --> 01:00:38,699
What good fortune to have
such a beautiful daughter!

813
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:41,727
Thank you... Let's talk over there

814
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:48,443
Son-in-law, who is that?

815
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,776
He's Boss White, the Stock Killer

816
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:53,874
Anyone who angers him meets a bad end

817
01:00:53,917 --> 01:00:56,886
You think the people
chasing you work for him?

818
01:00:58,055 --> 01:01:00,785
The night of the massacre

819
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:03,315
we were meeting to boycott him

820
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:04,793
He's worth investigating

821
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:06,558
Thank you

822
01:01:11,335 --> 01:01:13,132
I'm glad that you respect me

823
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:15,968
Too bad our project together
wasn't a success

824
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:20,966
Business is a day's work
But friendship is for a lifetime, right?

825
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:22,035
Honey

826
01:01:29,653 --> 01:01:31,553
I'm just giving you a hand

827
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:33,986
Thank you Honey

828
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:36,652
I cooked this especially for you. Eat up

829
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:42,029
But it's too fatty. My doctor said
my cholesterol is too high...

830
01:01:42,065 --> 01:01:44,693
Boss, we're taking photos. You in?

831
01:01:44,735 --> 01:01:47,966
No, thanks. But you can help me eat this

832
01:01:48,005 --> 01:01:50,200
Cooked to perfection. Thanks boss

833
01:01:56,914 --> 01:01:59,678
Rouge, what's the matter?
You want to take a photo?

834
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,206
No...

835
01:02:03,654 --> 01:02:06,054
Don't What?

836
01:02:07,157 --> 01:02:08,920
I don't like boys who drink

837
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:15,224
Oops, wrong glass
I usually only drink water

838
01:02:15,265 --> 01:02:19,565
No cigarettes, no alcohol
and no casual sex for me

839
01:02:19,603 --> 01:02:22,231
Kind of boring, don't you think?

840
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:31,077
How could you make such a mistake?

841
01:02:32,649 --> 01:02:35,743
Who could know
he would give it to an employee

842
01:02:35,786 --> 01:02:38,687
Rouge is making sure he doesn't drink

843
01:02:40,023 --> 01:02:42,651
We can't make our move today

844
01:02:42,693 --> 01:02:47,528
Come to my clubhouse tonight
for another plan

845
01:02:52,069 --> 01:02:54,663
Do you know why I stopped today?

846
01:02:56,006 --> 01:02:57,337
Why?

847
01:02:57,374 --> 01:03:03,472
Because in the crowd
there were 3 kung fu masters

848
01:03:04,348 --> 01:03:05,781
Really?

849
01:03:05,816 --> 01:03:10,753
The fat one weighs 200kg, but his
Tread Lightly Technique is impeccable

850
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:15,019
And the thin guy's
Flying Technique is as good as mine

851
01:03:15,058 --> 01:03:17,288
Moreover, there's that girl...

852
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:23,800
I know that girl. She's called Phoenix

853
01:03:23,834 --> 01:03:26,803
On Mount Hua, she was
always competing with Rouge

854
01:03:27,904 --> 01:03:30,202
I do my best not to arouse suspicion

855
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:34,267
But before I steal your husband's wealth

856
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:36,643
you bring these people to thwart me

857
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:40,274
White Eyebrows, here's an idea...

858
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:44,947
I'll ask my husband
to give you all his best assets

859
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:46,819
just don't hurt him, OK?

860
01:03:47,624 --> 01:03:49,285
Why?

861
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:52,386
You're only after
old bastard's money, right?

862
01:03:52,429 --> 01:03:55,330
Why are you suddenly so kind to him?

863
01:03:55,365 --> 01:03:58,801
We've been married for 10 years

864
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,735
I can't hurt him Shut up!

865
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:05,434
So you want me to kill
Rouge and your husband myself?

866
01:04:05,475 --> 01:04:07,943
But Rouge is your daughter

867
01:04:07,978 --> 01:04:11,709
You disobey me? I'll kill you too!

868
01:04:11,748 --> 01:04:16,378
If I don't hear he's dead tomorrow

869
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:20,914
your daughter will disappear
from this world!

870
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:23,985
Get down!

871
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:54,884
Are you OK?

872
01:05:01,932 --> 01:05:05,766
White Eyebrows? I knew you looked familiar

873
01:05:13,877 --> 01:05:15,538
Itchiban, are you OK?

874
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,041
I'm not OK. The one behind me
is hurt a little more

875
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:22,347
Itchiba... Dragon!

876
01:05:23,687 --> 01:05:24,949
You bastard!

877
01:05:47,677 --> 01:05:48,166
Sweetie

878
01:05:48,211 --> 01:05:51,203
Get out of here with Dragon
Don't wait for me

879
01:05:51,248 --> 01:05:52,943
Itchiban, you too

880
01:05:57,287 --> 01:05:58,379
Hello

881
01:05:58,421 --> 01:05:59,683
Brother, you looking for me?

882
01:05:59,723 --> 01:06:00,519
Where are you?

883
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:03,926
I'm already in a taxi
Don't worry about me

884
01:06:04,561 --> 01:06:06,153
I'm so relieved

885
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:08,529
Dad!

886
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:17,670
Big Bird!

887
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:45,464
Dragon, are you OK? Dragon

888
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:47,466
I...

889
01:06:49,139 --> 01:06:52,506
His vascular system is failing

890
01:06:52,542 --> 01:06:53,600
What can we do?

891
01:06:53,643 --> 01:06:57,079
Hawk can take him to Mount Hua
Find Principal of the Academy

892
01:06:57,113 --> 01:06:59,274
He'll think of a way to save him

893
01:06:59,316 --> 01:07:02,183
Hawk doesn't have the energy
to carry all three of us

894
01:07:02,219 --> 01:07:05,882
You two go first!
I'll figure out a way to get there

895
01:07:05,922 --> 01:07:07,150
If he gets any worse

896
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:10,250
you impart the strength
from your martial arts to save him

897
01:07:12,796 --> 01:07:14,491
Where to? Mount Hua

898
01:07:18,168 --> 01:07:20,295
Hold on, we're almost to Mount Hua

899
01:07:21,438 --> 01:07:26,535
I don't think we'll make it to Mount Hua

900
01:07:26,576 --> 01:07:29,841
Don't talk nonsense!
Hawk is flying there now

901
01:07:30,814 --> 01:07:34,181
I think we're going the wrong way

902
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:35,115
Why?

903
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,444
Look over there

904
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:46,893
Hawk, where are you going?

905
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:49,524
We want to go to Mount Hua
not Mount Fuji!

906
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:50,897
You dumb beast

907
01:07:57,607 --> 01:07:58,471
You pervert

908
01:07:58,508 --> 01:08:00,408
You're a hawk
Why are you chasing a crane?

909
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:03,310
Now we have to spend the night here

910
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:12,145
Don't scold him

911
01:08:13,623 --> 01:08:15,784
It's fate

912
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:20,319
If I'm going to die, nothing can save me

913
01:08:21,398 --> 01:08:25,027
No. I won't let you die. You can't die

914
01:08:28,338 --> 01:08:30,067
Why do you treat me so well?

915
01:08:31,374 --> 01:08:35,174
Because you're the man of my destiny

916
01:08:37,981 --> 01:08:39,846
You know...

917
01:08:41,785 --> 01:08:48,349
in the beginning, I was afraid of you

918
01:08:48,391 --> 01:08:51,155
And... tried to avoid you

919
01:08:56,533 --> 01:08:57,795
And then?

920
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:04,402
Then fear turned into love

921
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:50,016
Cabbie, how much?

922
01:09:50,053 --> 01:09:51,486
$88,000

923
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:53,079
Wow. It would have been cheaper to fly!

924
01:09:53,123 --> 01:09:54,886
I don't know how to go back!

925
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:57,984
Alright... Can I pay by credit card?

926
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,188
He's hurt badly

927
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:02,494
The 18 Coppermen can't save him

928
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:04,966
He'll die within an hour

929
01:10:05,001 --> 01:10:06,093
What can we do?

930
01:10:06,136 --> 01:10:07,296
We still have one last chance

931
01:10:07,337 --> 01:10:07,894
What is it?

932
01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:09,302
Use a Buddhist medicine...

933
01:10:09,339 --> 01:10:12,308
called The Cruel Cure
to bring him back from the dead

934
01:10:12,342 --> 01:10:15,607
It will also impart
30 years of kung fu training

935
01:10:15,645 --> 01:10:16,634
What are you waiting for?

936
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:19,011
However, after swallowing that pill

937
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:21,346
he will forget everyone he has loved

938
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:23,944
Even the woman he loves most...

939
01:10:23,987 --> 01:10:26,387
will seem like a hag
at the supermarket to him

940
01:10:26,423 --> 01:10:27,822
No feeling what so ever

941
01:10:27,857 --> 01:10:30,382
Dad, there's got to be another way

942
01:10:30,427 --> 01:10:32,088
Sweetie, save him first

943
01:10:32,128 --> 01:10:33,959
Life comes before love

944
01:10:58,955 --> 01:11:02,015
We've survived so many dangers together

945
01:11:02,058 --> 01:11:04,083
Just when our relationship is starting

946
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:07,889
why must I feed you this pill...

947
01:11:07,931 --> 01:11:10,422
that will make you forget me?

948
01:11:12,535 --> 01:11:14,526
Is God testing us?

949
01:11:18,641 --> 01:11:22,372
Wait any longer and it'll be too late

950
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:55,073
Phoenix, this isn't love

951
01:12:05,922 --> 01:12:08,857
We're two people from two different worlds

952
01:12:35,652 --> 01:12:39,645
Dragon, I trust you

953
01:12:41,391 --> 01:12:43,188
I know you won't forget me

954
01:13:00,944 --> 01:13:02,434
Dragon, are you OK?

955
01:13:05,448 --> 01:13:06,779
I'm OK

956
01:13:07,584 --> 01:13:09,484
But Ms., who are you?

957
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:12,316
Why are you sleeping next to me?

958
01:13:14,958 --> 01:13:16,152
I...

959
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:19,119
She's the woman you love most

960
01:13:21,064 --> 01:13:23,794
I know you. You were my bodyguard

961
01:13:24,801 --> 01:13:27,497
Not only that
I loaned you a couple million

962
01:13:27,537 --> 01:13:29,027
You old cheat

963
01:13:33,276 --> 01:13:34,573
But...

964
01:13:35,979 --> 01:13:37,970
Ms., you look very familiar

965
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:42,813
But I can't recall who you are

966
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:51,950
White Eyebrows has learned
the 9th Negative

967
01:13:51,995 --> 01:13:53,986
he is simply too powerful

968
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:56,157
We can't beat him

969
01:13:56,766 --> 01:13:57,824
Then...

970
01:13:57,867 --> 01:14:01,803
We have to use
our sect's strongest technique

971
01:14:01,838 --> 01:14:05,899
Unfortunately, nobody
has ever successfully learned it

972
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:08,536
<The Technique of the Pure
and Lethal Heart>?

973
01:14:08,578 --> 01:14:10,478
Sure. 4 people must practise it together

974
01:14:10,513 --> 01:14:12,037
2 men and 2 women are best

975
01:14:12,081 --> 01:14:13,878
They must be two couples in love

976
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:15,349
And they must practise it together

977
01:14:15,385 --> 01:14:16,852
Once learned... it is truly awesome

978
01:14:16,886 --> 01:14:19,980
The force of 4 people equals 100

979
01:14:20,857 --> 01:14:22,188
But where can we find 4 people?

980
01:14:27,230 --> 01:14:30,393
Hello, Dolina

981
01:14:31,934 --> 01:14:34,494
So sorry, Brother Wai

982
01:14:34,537 --> 01:14:37,995
My daughter's no where to be found

983
01:14:38,041 --> 01:14:39,702
I don't mind

984
01:14:39,742 --> 01:14:42,734
Dinner tonight is still great...

985
01:14:42,779 --> 01:14:44,144
so long as you're here

986
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:45,272
Me?

987
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:48,750
Honestly, I've been thinking...

988
01:14:48,785 --> 01:14:52,084
We're a better match than
me and your daughter

989
01:14:52,121 --> 01:14:53,986
How about... being my girlfriend?

990
01:14:54,023 --> 01:14:55,650
You psycho

991
01:14:55,692 --> 01:14:58,957
He fails with the daughter
so he goes for the mom

992
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:00,826
He moves fast, doesn't he?

993
01:15:00,863 --> 01:15:04,663
I've considered it thoroughly
You understand me

994
01:15:04,701 --> 01:15:10,105
You care for me. You love me

995
01:15:10,139 --> 01:15:11,936
I can feel it

996
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:14,373
I care for your money!

997
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:15,240
Be my girlfriend

998
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:18,442
Piss off!

999
01:15:18,481 --> 01:15:20,745
If I'm not careful
I just might beat you to death

1000
01:15:22,218 --> 01:15:23,776
Brother Wai, excuse me...

1001
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:24,912
Mom

1002
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:28,120
What are you here for?

1003
01:15:28,157 --> 01:15:29,818
We have to talk

1004
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:31,656
We've got nothing to talk about

1005
01:15:31,694 --> 01:15:34,686
Sure. Nothing to talk about
Right? My girlfriend

1006
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,095
Girlfriend?

1007
01:15:50,346 --> 01:15:51,904
Enough! Stop!

1008
01:15:57,453 --> 01:15:59,045
Enough! Stop!

1009
01:15:59,922 --> 01:16:00,786
Stop!

1010
01:16:03,826 --> 01:16:05,384
Can you stop hitting each other?

1011
01:16:05,428 --> 01:16:09,387
They're not hitting each other
they're hitting me

1012
01:16:10,299 --> 01:16:11,789
If you got something to say
fart it out already

1013
01:16:14,437 --> 01:16:17,065
Principal of the Academy has given us
the Lethal Heart technique

1014
01:16:17,106 --> 01:16:20,439
Only 2 pairs of family members
or devoted lovers...

1015
01:16:20,476 --> 01:16:22,603
will realize its true power

1016
01:16:22,645 --> 01:16:23,839
So... So what?

1017
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:26,815
So dad, Dragon and I
have been trained together

1018
01:16:26,849 --> 01:16:29,613
If you join us, we're sure
to beat White Eyebrows

1019
01:16:29,652 --> 01:16:31,085
You're crazy!

1020
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:34,021
I make millions of dollars a day

1021
01:16:34,056 --> 01:16:36,286
How do I have the time to fight?

1022
01:16:36,325 --> 01:16:37,349
I know

1023
01:16:37,393 --> 01:16:40,191
But without you, we won't have
two pairs of Pure Hearts

1024
01:16:40,229 --> 01:16:42,754
Forget it. You won't get
anything from Mrs. Scrooge

1025
01:16:42,799 --> 01:16:43,493
Let's go!

1026
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,458
I'm still better than
a bankrupt man like you

1027
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:50,496
Look at the animosity between you two?

1028
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:52,940
How can you be a pair of Pure Hearts?

1029
01:16:52,975 --> 01:16:54,840
Forget it. Off we march to our deaths

1030
01:17:04,287 --> 01:17:06,448
OK. Just put it here

1031
01:17:14,096 --> 01:17:17,031
He will never control his temper

1032
01:17:17,066 --> 01:17:21,264
If he just said a few nice words...

1033
01:17:21,304 --> 01:17:23,272
perhaps maybe I'd agree

1034
01:17:24,974 --> 01:17:28,967
Rouge, I thought you loved Dragon

1035
01:17:29,011 --> 01:17:30,808
I used to think so too

1036
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:33,812
But it turns out you love me

1037
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:39,551
Before, I thought
I was destined for Dragon

1038
01:17:39,589 --> 01:17:40,920
Why?

1039
01:17:40,957 --> 01:17:43,517
Something happened
that matched a prediction...

1040
01:17:43,559 --> 01:17:45,026
What happened?

1041
01:17:46,963 --> 01:17:48,225
How beautiful!

1042
01:17:50,566 --> 01:17:52,500
Please come with us, Ms. Lam

1043
01:17:52,535 --> 01:17:53,900
Who are you?

1044
01:17:53,936 --> 01:17:56,234
Anyone running around
dressed like that has to be crazy

1045
01:17:56,272 --> 01:17:57,762
Take this. I will protect you

1046
01:17:57,807 --> 01:17:59,138
No need!

1047
01:18:05,948 --> 01:18:08,109
They're the people who wanna kill Dragon!

1048
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:10,243
Didn't get enough of our Tendon-Bending
the first time, huh?

1049
01:18:35,478 --> 01:18:36,570
Tell her to stop!

1050
01:18:36,612 --> 01:18:37,738
Never! Not even if you kill me

1051
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:39,179
Really?

1052
01:18:41,384 --> 01:18:42,408
Kiddie Kim!

1053
01:19:06,008 --> 01:19:07,270
This is kind of unfair to your left side

1054
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:08,743
What do you mean unfair?

1055
01:19:13,182 --> 01:19:15,150
Stop! I'll go with you!

1056
01:19:16,218 --> 01:19:18,015
You surrender after
I've been stabbed 60 times

1057
01:19:18,054 --> 01:19:20,022
So I was stabbed 60 times for nothing?

1058
01:19:22,625 --> 01:19:24,388
60 times? I only see 2 wounds

1059
01:19:24,427 --> 01:19:26,224
They're very accurate

1060
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:28,423
Each time they stabbed the same place

1061
01:19:29,832 --> 01:19:32,858
So you're the one What?

1062
01:19:32,902 --> 01:19:34,597
The one I'm destined for

1063
01:19:35,471 --> 01:19:36,460
Go Kiddie Kim

1064
01:19:36,505 --> 01:19:38,097
Tell my mom to save me!

1065
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:41,166
Don't worry, Rouge! My mom, your mom...

1066
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:42,939
Every mom everywhere
I'll get them all to save you

1067
01:19:42,979 --> 01:19:44,810
Don't worry...

1068
01:19:44,847 --> 01:19:46,781
How can you be so heartless?

1069
01:19:46,816 --> 01:19:48,841
Can't you take the knives out
when you leave!

1070
01:19:50,853 --> 01:19:55,347
Jenny, I've just
brought your daughter here

1071
01:19:57,026 --> 01:19:57,754
What did you say?

1072
01:19:58,327 --> 01:20:01,888
I give you an hour
to bring Lincoln Lam here

1073
01:20:10,606 --> 01:20:12,039
That was Boss White, wasn't it?

1074
01:20:16,012 --> 01:20:18,674
I had a private detective follow you

1075
01:20:18,714 --> 01:20:20,682
Boss White's not an ordinary man

1076
01:20:20,716 --> 01:20:22,581
And I know you two had a relationship

1077
01:20:24,754 --> 01:20:28,315
Honey, forgive me

1078
01:20:28,357 --> 01:20:31,019
What ever happened before our marriage
doesn't matter

1079
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:32,925
He's forcing you to attack me, isn't he?

1080
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:35,925
They've kidnapped Rouge

1081
01:20:36,165 --> 01:20:37,792
Take me to him

1082
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:41,234
No. If you go, he'll kill you

1083
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:43,067
Some disasters can't be prevented

1084
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:47,031
Rouge is not my real daughter

1085
01:20:47,076 --> 01:20:50,273
but I love her like one

1086
01:20:52,915 --> 01:20:54,041
Honey

1087
01:21:03,726 --> 01:21:07,560
Boss Lam, you've got
a real leader's courage

1088
01:21:07,596 --> 01:21:08,995
You do everything yourself

1089
01:21:09,031 --> 01:21:13,127
Truly a man capable of great things

1090
01:21:13,169 --> 01:21:17,367
Jenny, have you told him what I want?

1091
01:21:18,774 --> 01:21:21,470
I'm willing to give you all my wealth

1092
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:23,410
But you must set my daughter free

1093
01:21:23,446 --> 01:21:25,971
Then we'll leave right away

1094
01:21:26,015 --> 01:21:27,642
Give him the contract

1095
01:21:38,294 --> 01:21:39,158
(Eat shit!)

1096
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:43,223
Don't worry, boss. Go save Rouge

1097
01:21:43,265 --> 01:21:44,163
Come on

1098
01:21:44,934 --> 01:21:47,164
So the losers come back to tempt death?

1099
01:21:49,138 --> 01:21:50,070
Kill them!

1100
01:22:38,187 --> 01:22:43,682
Principal of the Academy has taught you
the Technique of the Pure and Lethal Heart

1101
01:22:43,726 --> 01:22:45,717
So your Pure Heart must be the bird?

1102
01:22:45,761 --> 01:22:47,888
Mind your own business! Hawk!

1103
01:22:52,868 --> 01:22:54,335
You're a total embarrassment!

1104
01:23:33,275 --> 01:23:34,537
Get behind me!

1105
01:23:47,089 --> 01:23:48,386
You came?

1106
01:23:48,424 --> 01:23:49,857
In a clutch, I stand by my family

1107
01:23:49,892 --> 01:23:51,052
Let's get him

1108
01:23:55,931 --> 01:23:56,920
Let's get him

1109
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:09,775
Phoenix

1110
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:16,174
Sorry, our timing never seems right

1111
01:24:16,218 --> 01:24:18,049
Because you've no feeling for me

1112
01:24:20,956 --> 01:24:25,893
It's all my fault. I forgot everything...

1113
01:25:09,905 --> 01:25:11,395
I remember

1114
01:25:13,676 --> 01:25:14,540
I remember

1115
01:25:15,878 --> 01:25:17,209
I remember! You saved me

1116
01:25:19,181 --> 01:25:20,273
You removed the poison

1117
01:25:21,517 --> 01:25:23,007
You took me to Mount Hua

1118
01:25:24,086 --> 01:25:25,280
Hawk went the wrong way

1119
01:25:27,690 --> 01:25:29,453
I recovered my memory...

1120
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:32,457
Really?

1121
01:25:34,697 --> 01:25:37,165
Phoenix, this is no time for love

1122
01:25:37,266 --> 01:25:38,733
We can't hold up much longer

1123
01:25:38,767 --> 01:25:40,632
The pure of heart are invincible!

1124
01:25:40,669 --> 01:25:41,533
Let's not exaggerate too much

1125
01:25:43,339 --> 01:25:44,829
White Eyebrows is too strong

1126
01:25:44,873 --> 01:25:47,034
Working together with a single heart
so that we can defeat him...

1127
01:25:47,076 --> 01:25:48,441
Let's get that bastard...

1128
01:25:50,813 --> 01:25:52,872
The family that stays together
kicks ass together!

1129
01:25:52,915 --> 01:25:56,316
What tricks to you have left fight with?

1130
01:26:00,622 --> 01:26:01,418
Let's go!

1131
01:26:17,673 --> 01:26:18,469
Watch out!

1132
01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:39,126
Flying Swallow Attack!

1133
01:27:07,689 --> 01:27:09,816
One - Family - United - Always

1134
01:27:09,858 --> 01:27:11,155
Succeeds!

1135
01:27:20,202 --> 01:27:21,066
Father-in-law

1136
01:27:21,103 --> 01:27:23,003
Let cops handle him

1137
01:27:23,705 --> 01:27:25,605
I like the sound of father-in-law

1138
01:27:25,641 --> 01:27:26,903
What your say goes

1139
01:27:27,910 --> 01:27:29,878
How about me? Mother-in-law!

1140
01:27:30,846 --> 01:27:33,110
And me? Honey!

1141
01:27:41,390 --> 01:27:46,384
Dad, Mom...

1142
01:27:46,428 --> 01:27:48,123
I just saw 4 people

1143
01:27:48,163 --> 01:27:50,324
fly past the moon

1144
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,631
You must have been dreaming

1145
01:27:53,669 --> 01:27:55,864
People can't fly!

1146
01:27:56,805 --> 01:27:59,239
You must be watching too much TV

1147
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:01,367
What an over-active imagination!
