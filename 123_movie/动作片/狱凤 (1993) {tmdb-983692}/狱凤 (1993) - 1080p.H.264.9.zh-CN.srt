2
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:50,471
Step out of your vehicles.
Leave the car with the keys inside.

3
00:01:50,575 --> 00:01:56,310
Take all personal belongings
with you to inspection.

4
00:01:57,874 --> 00:02:02,045
Move on.

5
00:02:05,694 --> 00:02:10,699
- Do you think I'm scared, Captain?
- You're never scared.

6
00:02:10,908 --> 00:02:17,164
- Except when you're scared.
- Then you're really scared.

7
00:02:20,084 --> 00:02:23,837
Why don't you get out of here
and we'll both feel better?

8
00:02:24,046 --> 00:02:27,487
- I can take this trip alone.
- No!

9
00:02:37,288 --> 00:02:40,625
Look at it, Karen, please.

10
00:02:40,834 --> 00:02:47,090
- Shit! It keeps doing that.
- Don't lift your arms up.

11
00:02:48,654 --> 00:02:51,782
I guess I can't salute.

12
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,806
Get out of the car, please.

13
00:02:59,602 --> 00:03:05,859
Step out of your vehicle.
Leave the car with the keys inside.

14
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:10,864
Take all personal belongings
with you to inspection.

15
00:03:12,428 --> 00:03:15,869
Identification.

16
00:03:19,101 --> 00:03:22,542
Travel authorization to Vancouver.

17
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:37,453
Let me guess, the big one's hers.
Am I right or am I right?

18
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:44,439
I've never known it to fall. They
change clothes three times a day.

19
00:03:44,856 --> 00:03:49,444
- We've got a positive here.
- No, there must be a mistake!

20
00:03:53,927 --> 00:03:59,037
Goddamn breeders!
You think they'd learn.

21
00:03:59,245 --> 00:04:02,582
- Some never do.
- Ain't that the truth.

22
00:04:02,686 --> 00:04:06,648
- Next.
- Your turn.

23
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:29,901
Negative. Proceed.

24
00:04:30,422 --> 00:04:33,342
Hey, come on.

25
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:55,447
- Don't forget her favourite dress.
- Thanks. I'm just so tired.

26
00:04:55,656 --> 00:04:57,846
I've been driving all night.

27
00:05:04,936 --> 00:05:09,107
This bitch
is trying to get past our machines!

28
00:05:09,315 --> 00:05:12,548
Goddman fucking flack jacket!

29
00:05:35,383 --> 00:05:38,094
Run! Go!

30
00:06:03,223 --> 00:06:09,167
You're under arrest. Stand up and
keep your hands away from your body.

31
00:06:15,944 --> 00:06:20,949
Hold your position.
Put your hands over your head.

32
00:06:21,158 --> 00:06:24,286
You are under arrest.

33
00:06:43,993 --> 00:06:48,581
I did a feature on this place.
It's enormous.

34
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,918
- Like your mouth.
- It's got no windows.

35
00:06:52,126 --> 00:06:54,838
Attention, prisoners.

36
00:06:54,942 --> 00:06:57,653
You are entering the Fortress.

37
00:06:57,861 --> 00:07:04,118
A private maximum-security prison
run by the Men-Tel Corporation.

38
00:07:04,326 --> 00:07:09,540
I only bounced a couple of cheques
and they give me maximum security.

39
00:07:09,748 --> 00:07:12,981
It's located in a secluded desert.

40
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:17,986
No life can survive here.
Escape is impossible.

41
00:07:18,507 --> 00:07:23,095
- 60 days I've got to do.
- That's short-term, man.

42
00:07:23,303 --> 00:07:26,849
- You're only taking a nap.
- I never nap.

43
00:07:27,057 --> 00:07:31,228
- What did they get you for?
- My wife was pregnant again.

44
00:07:31,437 --> 00:07:34,252
One wasn't enough?

45
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,901
- He died at birth.
- Didn't they tie her tubes?

46
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:41,864
They said they did.
I guess we got lucky.

47
00:07:42,072 --> 00:07:47,807
- Lucky? What did they give you?
- 31 years.

48
00:07:47,911 --> 00:07:53,751
- Why the fuck are you smiling?
- She got away.

49
00:07:53,959 --> 00:08:00,320
This is a complete security
environment. Crime does not pay.

50
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,164
It's 30 stories high.
How can it be invisible?

51
00:08:11,372 --> 00:08:16,377
Calm down. Take a deep breath.

52
00:08:16,586 --> 00:08:21,070
- Forget him. He's dead.
- He's just scared, okay?

53
00:08:21,278 --> 00:08:25,032
The scared don't survive inside.

54
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:11,954
All right, everybody, strip.

55
00:09:12,162 --> 00:09:15,186
Now!

56
00:09:31,974 --> 00:09:36,040
All prisoners,
your attention, please.

57
00:09:37,187 --> 00:09:40,003
Welcome to the Fortress.

58
00:09:40,107 --> 00:09:44,278
Everything here is the property
of the Men-Tel Corporation.

59
00:09:44,486 --> 00:09:49,387
Including you.
I am Prison Director Poe.

60
00:09:49,596 --> 00:09:55,539
The Federal Government pays Men-Tel
$27 a day for each one of you.

61
00:09:55,748 --> 00:09:59,606
They expect us to put you to use
expanding our facility.

62
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:04,089
- Hidden weaponry.
- Open your mouth!

63
00:10:04,298 --> 00:10:07,426
Spit it out and put it in the bin.

64
00:10:07,634 --> 00:10:13,057
Your work shift will be determined
by our computer ZED-10.

65
00:10:13,161 --> 00:10:17,957
You will learn to live
without day or night.

66
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:22,441
These are Psychological
Security intelligence Systems.

67
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:26,195
P.S.l.S.

68
00:10:26,403 --> 00:10:32,034
Your thoughts
will be with me... always.

69
00:10:35,371 --> 00:10:38,603
Put your heads in. Now!

70
00:10:41,418 --> 00:10:45,902
Prepare intestinator tagging.

71
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,760
You are about to be outfitted
with intestinators.

72
00:10:49,864 --> 00:10:54,139
Men-Tel's automatic
behaviour-control device.

73
00:10:54,348 --> 00:10:56,642
Observe all rules.

74
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,917
Be especially observant
of the yellow and red lines.

75
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:04,983
Crossing a yellow line
will result in pain.

76
00:11:05,192 --> 00:11:10,406
Crossing a red line
will result in death.

77
00:11:27,402 --> 00:11:31,677
I have an illness.
It's called claustrophobia.

78
00:11:31,885 --> 00:11:36,369
- It's a real illness!
- Don't do this.

79
00:11:36,578 --> 00:11:40,123
Remain in line.
Do not cross the yellow line.

80
00:11:40,331 --> 00:11:44,085
Nobody's listening to me!
I have a note from my doctor.

81
00:11:44,294 --> 00:11:49,716
- Yellow is pain.
- I cannot stay here! Listen!

82
00:11:50,446 --> 00:11:54,304
The intestinator
is now in pain mode.

83
00:11:54,512 --> 00:11:57,745
Turn it off!

84
00:11:57,849 --> 00:12:02,541
Do not cross the red line.
Red is death.

85
00:12:27,462 --> 00:12:32,571
I told you. Dead on arrival.

86
00:12:48,107 --> 00:12:52,174
The Fortress is the world's largest
underground penitentiary.

87
00:12:52,383 --> 00:12:58,013
33 stories deep. Neutron cannons
are housed in the central core.

88
00:12:58,117 --> 00:13:02,184
They destroy only organic matter.

89
00:13:38,783 --> 00:13:42,850
Prisoners Brennick and Gomez,
get off here, please.

90
00:14:23,828 --> 00:14:27,895
Up these stairs, please.

91
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:46,351
Come with me, please.

92
00:15:03,347 --> 00:15:08,456
No fucking way!
We're not taking any more in here!

93
00:15:08,665 --> 00:15:12,418
- We've got a crowd in here now.
- Complaining is a violation.

94
00:15:12,627 --> 00:15:17,736
- So is overcrowding.
- Intestination starts in 5 seconds.

95
00:15:17,945 --> 00:15:20,447
No, come on.

96
00:15:20,656 --> 00:15:25,139
All right, big mama, come on.

97
00:15:25,869 --> 00:15:29,415
The more the merrier.

98
00:15:29,623 --> 00:15:32,021
Bitch.

99
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:37,131
- 5 seconds to enter cell.
- Come on in.

100
00:15:42,866 --> 00:15:48,183
- What happens if you walk out?
- Try it.

101
00:15:48,392 --> 00:15:51,311
What's your problem?

102
00:15:52,771 --> 00:15:57,151
Laser perimeter intrusion.
Step back, please.

103
00:15:57,359 --> 00:16:00,904
Smart fish. Very smart.

104
00:16:02,573 --> 00:16:07,161
- You'll have to pay the rent.
- I do my own time.

105
00:16:07,369 --> 00:16:11,227
There's all kinds of time.
Think about it.

106
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:15,294
You don't pay the rent,
me and Maddox come and get it.

107
00:16:15,398 --> 00:16:18,213
Is that you?

108
00:16:19,986 --> 00:16:26,242
No. Maddox is hard to miss. He's got
a 187 tattooed on his forehead.

109
00:16:27,598 --> 00:16:30,934
Do you know what 187 means, fish?

110
00:16:32,707 --> 00:16:35,314
I bet it's not your I.Q.

111
00:16:36,252 --> 00:16:41,466
187. Murder statute.
He's doing the big bitch.

112
00:16:41,674 --> 00:16:45,115
So maybe you want to pay the rent
after all.

113
00:16:51,789 --> 00:16:54,917
60 seconds to lights out.

114
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:58,462
Brennick, John.

115
00:17:00,235 --> 00:17:03,154
D-Day.

116
00:17:03,363 --> 00:17:07,325
Anywhere you like, man.

117
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:13,268
Hey, pretty boy,
is your ass as sweet as your face?

118
00:17:13,477 --> 00:17:19,525
- If it is, you can bunk with me.
- Try it and you're dead.

119
00:17:21,714 --> 00:17:24,634
I can wait.

120
00:17:27,971 --> 00:17:30,473
Night-night, sweetie.

121
00:17:38,085 --> 00:17:42,256
Don't dream.

122
00:19:15,891 --> 00:19:19,749
You're enjoying this.

123
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:25,380
- Yes, I suppose I am.
- Your function is to monitor.

124
00:19:25,588 --> 00:19:30,489
We do not observe
for personal pleasure.

125
00:19:31,845 --> 00:19:35,077
You don't understand pleasure...

126
00:19:36,328 --> 00:19:40,290
or pain. I do.

127
00:19:43,002 --> 00:19:49,466
- It is time for pain.
- I'm afraid it is.

128
00:19:52,177 --> 00:19:54,784
Unauthorized thought process.

129
00:19:56,974 --> 00:20:02,083
What's the matter?
Stomach ache? Indigestion maybe?

130
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:46,815
What's with him?

131
00:20:47,024 --> 00:20:52,759
He's a ghost.
He got himself mind-wiped.

132
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:58,181
- He tried to escape. Big mistake.
- A mistake is what you make it.

133
00:20:58,389 --> 00:21:02,143
Nobody makes it out of this place.

134
00:21:02,352 --> 00:21:06,210
Don't believe
everything they tell you.

135
00:21:06,418 --> 00:21:10,172
Help!

136
00:21:11,006 --> 00:21:16,950
Leave me alone! Help!

137
00:21:21,642 --> 00:21:24,874
Private party.

138
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:53,340
Violence will not be tolerated.

139
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:00,014
Prisoners
Maddox, Brennick and Gomez.

140
00:22:00,222 --> 00:22:05,331
You will be released from solitary
when the perpetrator is revealed.

141
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:09,502
I can't stand here any more.

142
00:22:11,588 --> 00:22:17,427
- I've got to get out of here.
- Then fry, you little fuck!

143
00:22:17,531 --> 00:22:20,555
Come on, you can do it.

144
00:22:28,062 --> 00:22:32,233
Are you ready
to identify the perpetrator?

145
00:22:35,778 --> 00:22:39,949
- I've got to get out of here.
- Think about being strong.

146
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,869
I am.

147
00:22:42,973 --> 00:22:45,997
- Tell them... you're dead.
- Shut your mouth.

148
00:22:46,206 --> 00:22:49,021
I'll shut yours... permanently.

149
00:22:49,229 --> 00:22:53,087
915764, are you ready
to identify the perpetrator?

150
00:22:53,296 --> 00:22:53,796
No...

151
00:22:58,614 --> 00:23:02,680
Who started the incident?

152
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:08,937
It was...

153
00:23:09,145 --> 00:23:11,543
It was...

154
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:18,842
- Who started the incident?
- I did it.

155
00:23:19,051 --> 00:23:21,762
It was me.

156
00:23:22,492 --> 00:23:27,601
Prisoner Brennick,
report to Director Poe immediately.

157
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:48,977
Sit down, 95763.

158
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:55,129
- My name is Brennick.
- Of course it is.

159
00:23:55,337 --> 00:24:00,029
- Make yourself comfortable.
- I am comfortable.

160
00:24:00,134 --> 00:24:03,366
You're acquainted with Abraham.

161
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:08,058
He is the very best of our trustees.

162
00:24:08,267 --> 00:24:12,750
I have written some excellent parole
reports, but in all honesty, -

163
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:17,338
- I don't know what I would do
if he were to leave us.

164
00:24:17,547 --> 00:24:21,301
John Brennick...

165
00:24:21,405 --> 00:24:26,514
The most decorated captain
in the history of the black beret.

166
00:24:26,723 --> 00:24:30,894
Yet you quit in disgrace,
didn't you?

167
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:37,463
- You lost an entire platoon.
- That's no business of yours!

168
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:42,780
So touchy.
I suppose that's understandable.

169
00:24:42,989 --> 00:24:45,491
But still...

170
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,601
Would you want to lose
this particular former soldier?

171
00:25:06,554 --> 00:25:10,829
We caught her before she reached
the far side of the bridge.

172
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:16,147
The law is clear:
One chlld per woman.

173
00:25:16,251 --> 00:25:20,214
We live on a very small
and fragile planet.

174
00:25:20,422 --> 00:25:24,072
We must maintain
the population balance.

175
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:30,119
Abortion is illegal and that
leaves only one alternative.

176
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:33,769
She is so beautiful.

177
00:25:38,148 --> 00:25:42,841
- Intestinate, Karen Brennick.
- Intestination commencing.

178
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:47,116
- You bastard!
- ZED...

179
00:25:49,201 --> 00:25:54,102
I don't think you reallse
your predicament, Brennick.

180
00:25:54,415 --> 00:25:59,003
You have nothing.
You have nowhere to hide.

181
00:25:59,211 --> 00:26:02,652
You are nothing.

182
00:26:12,036 --> 00:26:15,269
I fucked up.
I couldn't handle it, man.

183
00:26:15,477 --> 00:26:20,482
I know.
You better watch yourself.

184
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,099
Where's the women's section?

185
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:39,981
- Don't even think about it.
- Are you gonna report me?

186
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:43,839
His little sisters will do that.

187
00:26:44,673 --> 00:26:50,200
- Where's the women's section?
- I am not going to die inside.

188
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:54,579
You'll die right here
if you don't tell me.

189
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:57,186
Ain't that a bitch.

190
00:26:57,394 --> 00:27:03,025
Two fucking days and you're
just like everybody else in here.

191
00:27:03,233 --> 00:27:08,030
- You didn't answer my question.
- Fuck you.

192
00:27:12,826 --> 00:27:16,580
Levels A and B.

193
00:27:30,552 --> 00:27:32,638
What is it?

194
00:27:32,846 --> 00:27:37,851
The baby's kicking.
I can feel it kicking.

195
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:41,814
It's fine. It's natural.

196
00:27:42,022 --> 00:27:47,966
I just want to hold my baby
for a little while.

197
00:27:48,174 --> 00:27:51,302
I know I can't keep her, -

198
00:27:51,511 --> 00:27:56,829
- but just to see her
open her eyes...

199
00:28:00,582 --> 00:28:05,170
I won't let them take my baby.

200
00:28:13,721 --> 00:28:17,683
Remove number 74270.

201
00:28:17,891 --> 00:28:21,020
No...

202
00:28:29,465 --> 00:28:32,594
Get her!

203
00:28:32,906 --> 00:28:35,722
Stop her!

204
00:28:40,101 --> 00:28:43,542
Into the operating room.

205
00:28:43,646 --> 00:28:46,253
Come on, take it easy.

206
00:28:53,552 --> 00:28:59,808
Your babies are the property
of the Men-Tel Corporation.

207
00:29:08,776 --> 00:29:13,155
Rise and fucking shine, asshole!

208
00:29:34,426 --> 00:29:38,597
Laser perimeter intrusion.
Step back, please.

209
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:55,072
- Shall I intestinate?
- No.

210
00:31:26,205 --> 00:31:29,124
Retract the bridge.

211
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:13,857
42910 is no longer any use.

212
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:19,070
I have a death warrant in his name.
Execute it, 95763.

213
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:30,748
That is an order!

214
00:33:26,012 --> 00:33:31,955
Your sentimentality is touching,
but quite foolish, Brennick.

215
00:33:32,164 --> 00:33:36,752
Prisoners, a demonstration.

216
00:33:37,586 --> 00:33:40,818
Let 'em go! Now!

217
00:34:36,082 --> 00:34:39,314
You fucking asshole!

218
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,765
Hold your fire, ZED.
Intestinate, Brennick.

219
00:34:55,372 --> 00:34:57,875
Random intestination.

220
00:35:09,136 --> 00:35:11,847
Come on, Karen!

221
00:35:25,611 --> 00:35:29,990
Take John Brennick to isolation
to await punishment.

222
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:33,952
Disobedience will not be tolerated.

223
00:35:45,735 --> 00:35:50,740
- I owe you an apology.
- Not necessary.

224
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:53,660
Niàno...

225
00:35:53,868 --> 00:35:57,205
Come on, man. Let's go.

226
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,097
Shit, man!

227
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:17,433
Black beauties!

228
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:26,922
- This is Brennick's bed now.
- Since when?

229
00:36:27,131 --> 00:36:30,467
Since your friend
got blasted by the splatter gun.

230
00:36:30,676 --> 00:36:33,387
Dickhead!

231
00:36:50,696 --> 00:36:54,345
- You look awful.
- That bad?

232
00:36:54,554 --> 00:36:56,014
Worse.

233
00:36:56,222 --> 00:37:00,185
I was clumsy.
I ran into a brick wall.

234
00:37:00,393 --> 00:37:03,625
Only the wall was moving.

235
00:37:03,834 --> 00:37:07,171
- Poe wants you to cooperate.
- So he told me.

236
00:37:07,379 --> 00:37:10,820
He says I should tell you
it's gonna be very bad if you don't.

237
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:13,114
No kidding.

238
00:37:13,323 --> 00:37:17,493
He says if I care about you at all
I would beg you to listen.

239
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:23,541
- What do you say?
- I want my husband.

240
00:37:24,688 --> 00:37:27,712
You got him.

241
00:37:28,963 --> 00:37:35,428
John, no matter what you do...
I'll never not love you.

242
00:37:35,637 --> 00:37:40,329
You're real lousy at goodbyes,
you know that?

243
00:37:40,537 --> 00:37:43,770
I always have been.

244
00:37:54,301 --> 00:37:57,742
Commence procedure.

245
00:39:48,165 --> 00:39:52,127
John, help me!

246
00:40:39,466 --> 00:40:43,012
He's been in there for three days.

247
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:47,495
No one has ever lasted four.

248
00:40:47,704 --> 00:40:52,396
There's a first time for everything.

249
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:59,591
- You could stop his pain.
- But there's a price.

250
00:41:05,221 --> 00:41:09,288
I want you to live here.

251
00:41:10,539 --> 00:41:14,814
To share my quarters
for the remainder of your stay.

252
00:41:15,023 --> 00:41:18,568
- Why me?
- Why does music give me pleasure?

253
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:21,905
I skipped music appreciation.

254
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:27,535
I'm... looking for a companion.

255
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:32,644
I'm not very friendly
to anyone who tortures my husband.

256
00:41:48,598 --> 00:41:51,518
Stop it!

257
00:41:58,295 --> 00:42:01,319
Stop it!

258
00:42:02,883 --> 00:42:05,907
Yes...

259
00:42:07,575 --> 00:42:12,372
- What?
- Yes! Bastard! Just let him go.

260
00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:21,965
Release John Brennick.
Return him to his cell.

261
00:42:29,368 --> 00:42:35,520
Mother of God!
What have they done to him?

262
00:42:40,421 --> 00:42:44,070
He's a ghost.

263
00:42:44,279 --> 00:42:49,596
- He's gone.
- Bullshit! He's breathing.

264
00:42:49,805 --> 00:42:52,829
The mind is dead.

265
00:42:54,184 --> 00:42:57,521
The body just don't know it yet.

266
00:42:59,502 --> 00:43:03,673
- Welcome home, baby.
- Shall I intestinate?

267
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:06,905
Just a moment longer, ZED.

268
00:43:07,114 --> 00:43:11,910
This is a fascinating dream.

269
00:43:12,953 --> 00:43:15,873
Quite instructive...

270
00:43:16,081 --> 00:43:20,982
regarding
the prisoner's psychology.

271
00:43:22,338 --> 00:43:26,925
The Brennick woman is causing you
to act in an unprofessional manner.

272
00:43:27,134 --> 00:43:30,575
None of your business.

273
00:43:32,973 --> 00:43:37,665
- Her presence is a violation.
- I make my own decisions, ZED!

274
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:46,111
Shall I intestinate?

275
00:43:47,467 --> 00:43:50,908
Unauthorized thought process.

276
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:01,856
It's a very advanced model.

277
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:07,591
Yes, you were a computer technician
in the army.

278
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,345
I never got near anything
as powerful as ZED.

279
00:44:11,553 --> 00:44:17,184
Of course not. No one has.
Don't touch her!

280
00:44:17,705 --> 00:44:21,980
ZED, seal control.

281
00:44:22,189 --> 00:44:26,777
If you ever lay a finger
on her keyboard, -

282
00:44:26,985 --> 00:44:30,009
- or utter a single voice command, -

283
00:44:30,218 --> 00:44:36,161
- you and your child will feel
a pain unknown in human history.

284
00:44:49,925 --> 00:44:52,428
Don't touch him, asshole!

285
00:44:52,636 --> 00:44:56,598
What the fuck does he care?
He did it to himself.

286
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:59,727
No, they did it!

287
00:44:59,935 --> 00:45:03,793
And what are you gonna do about it?

288
00:45:04,836 --> 00:45:08,173
Yeah, right.

289
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:04,687
- What are you?
- I am enhanced.

290
00:46:05,939 --> 00:46:12,091
- You're not human.
- A monster? A freak?

291
00:46:24,395 --> 00:46:32,319
The Men-Tel Corporation transformed
me into a more efficient being.

292
00:46:36,281 --> 00:46:39,827
Once a month,
I absorb amino acids.

293
00:46:40,035 --> 00:46:43,580
I waste neither food nor fuel.

294
00:46:43,685 --> 00:46:50,149
When my kind are in the majority,
there will be no more world hunger.

295
00:46:50,358 --> 00:46:55,259
You don't sleep. You don't eat.
You can't make love, can you?

296
00:46:56,823 --> 00:47:00,785
No, but I can love.

297
00:47:00,994 --> 00:47:05,582
- Are there others like you?
- Not many as advanced, but yes.

298
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:09,127
I was one of Men-Tel's first babies.
It was very special.

299
00:47:09,335 --> 00:47:14,236
- You're what becomes of our babies?
- Of course.

300
00:47:18,198 --> 00:47:21,431
I saw your wife, Cap.

301
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:24,976
I saw Karen.

302
00:47:29,877 --> 00:47:33,422
She's getting larger.

303
00:47:33,526 --> 00:47:37,593
You can tell she's pregnant now.

304
00:47:47,707 --> 00:47:51,982
She felt the baby move.

305
00:47:52,086 --> 00:47:55,632
Your baby.

306
00:48:13,045 --> 00:48:14,713
No...

307
00:48:14,817 --> 00:48:18,467
You know I cannot.

308
00:48:18,676 --> 00:48:21,699
I know.

309
00:48:23,263 --> 00:48:26,809
But have you ever tried?

310
00:48:48,184 --> 00:48:52,251
This is... very special.

311
00:49:06,953 --> 00:49:10,811
I wonder why
I've never tried this before.

312
00:49:13,001 --> 00:49:16,233
How do you feel?

313
00:49:17,797 --> 00:49:21,759
Very happy.

314
00:49:50,538 --> 00:49:55,752
Why aren't you in voice mode?

315
00:49:57,941 --> 00:50:02,529
Proceed, Director Poe.

316
00:50:49,868 --> 00:50:52,684
Come here, Johnny.

317
00:50:53,726 --> 00:50:57,063
Come here, Johnny.

318
00:51:19,586 --> 00:51:23,235
You don't have to be afraid.

319
00:51:45,445 --> 00:51:48,469
John...

320
00:51:57,123 --> 00:52:00,356
I'm here, John.

321
00:52:02,128 --> 00:52:06,716
- Karen, where are you?
- Right here.

322
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:14,224
I must be more moderate
in the future.

323
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:21,523
Good morning, cell block orange,
level F.

324
00:52:21,731 --> 00:52:26,840
30 minutes
before reporting for work.

325
00:52:27,675 --> 00:52:31,845
- Get Brennick up.
- I'm awake.

326
00:52:35,912 --> 00:52:39,457
Holy Fuck! You're alive!

327
00:52:41,438 --> 00:52:46,443
- How long was I out?
- Four months.

328
00:52:46,652 --> 00:52:51,761
It's true, man. You were long gone.

329
00:52:58,643 --> 00:53:01,667
I'm okay.

330
00:53:04,065 --> 00:53:10,113
Wait! I've been in here that long?
Karen's getting near term.

331
00:53:10,217 --> 00:53:14,701
- She's all right.
- Did you seen her?

332
00:53:20,123 --> 00:53:24,502
Are you strong enough for the truth?

333
00:53:24,711 --> 00:53:28,360
Karen moved into Poe's quarters.

334
00:53:28,569 --> 00:53:32,740
That's why he didn't kill you.

335
00:53:36,389 --> 00:53:41,811
- She saved herself.
- She's closer to the way out.

336
00:53:44,001 --> 00:53:48,276
- You'll never get in there.
- You do.

337
00:53:50,674 --> 00:53:53,489
That's my job.

338
00:53:53,698 --> 00:53:58,390
I've got a parole to worry about.
I'm not going to jeopardize that -

339
00:53:58,599 --> 00:54:02,457
- so you can play
some great-escape bullshit!

340
00:54:02,665 --> 00:54:05,585
I'm not playing.

341
00:54:14,448 --> 00:54:18,306
We need to talk.

342
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:26,022
- Talk's dangerous.
- That's right, it is.

343
00:54:26,231 --> 00:54:29,567
I've been talking to your husband.

344
00:54:29,672 --> 00:54:33,217
I'm John's cell mate.

345
00:54:34,885 --> 00:54:40,620
- All this time...
- He's been like a zombie.

346
00:54:40,724 --> 00:54:46,876
There was nothing there...
until today.

347
00:54:49,796 --> 00:54:53,132
It worked?

348
00:54:53,237 --> 00:54:56,573
It worked!

349
00:54:56,782 --> 00:55:01,474
- Thank God!
- I don't know what you did.

350
00:55:01,683 --> 00:55:06,896
But now he's planning an escape.
Nobody ever gets out of here.

351
00:55:07,105 --> 00:55:12,110
He's a good man.
I don't want to see him die.

352
00:55:12,318 --> 00:55:16,281
He won't die. Not if I help him.

353
00:55:20,139 --> 00:55:23,684
I don't know how,
but this will get Karen out.

354
00:55:23,892 --> 00:55:29,106
Let me see that.
I know about these things.

355
00:55:29,314 --> 00:55:32,860
I'll have to take it apart, but...

356
00:55:33,068 --> 00:55:37,448
- Can you put it back together?
- Machines love me.

357
00:55:37,656 --> 00:55:41,827
I can make it work.
It's what I did in the world.

358
00:55:42,036 --> 00:55:45,059
- Mechanic?
- No, explosives.

359
00:55:45,268 --> 00:55:48,083
First Intercontinental Bank.

360
00:55:48,292 --> 00:55:52,671
I blew that safe
like it was fucking butter!

361
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:58,406
My partners didn't appreciate
my work and turned my ass in.

362
00:55:58,615 --> 00:56:03,828
- Why?
- Shit! I blew up the money.

363
00:56:06,852 --> 00:56:10,397
Don't fuck it up.

364
00:56:17,696 --> 00:56:21,033
New pods will be ready next month.

365
00:56:21,241 --> 00:56:25,829
- We're still behind schedule.
- Problems with the bedrock.

366
00:56:26,663 --> 00:56:31,147
Five new levels must be ready
by the end of the year.

367
00:56:31,356 --> 00:56:33,754
Yes, I am aware of that.

368
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:42,825
Reset your clock, ZED.
All work hours are now 93 minutes.

369
00:56:43,034 --> 00:56:46,371
Confirmed.

370
00:56:52,627 --> 00:56:58,362
- What are you doing awake?
- I couldn't sleep.

371
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:04,305
For the sake of our baby,
you must get your rest.

372
00:57:39,445 --> 00:57:43,615
This thing is amazing!
She's beautiful!

373
00:57:43,824 --> 00:57:48,099
This thing is a working genius.
Look at this.

374
00:57:48,308 --> 00:57:52,061
This is a series of micros.
That's your pain mode.

375
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:55,815
This is a macro. That kills you.

376
00:57:56,024 --> 00:58:01,550
This little thing on top,
that's your nerve clip.

377
00:58:01,759 --> 00:58:04,991
I need you to put it back together.

378
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:11,352
- I'm working on it.
- And get it out of me.

379
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:17,608
I may be able
to cause you to throw it up...

380
00:58:17,816 --> 00:58:23,343
but this bitch
is highly sensitive.

381
00:58:23,447 --> 00:58:28,556
We're talking TNT on PMS.

382
00:58:28,765 --> 00:58:33,561
- Could it kill me?
- Definite possibility.

383
00:58:33,665 --> 00:58:38,149
- Find another way.
- Maybe there is no other way.

384
00:58:38,358 --> 00:58:42,946
Wrong answer. Try again.

385
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:46,595
- If I get it...
- When you get it.

386
00:58:46,804 --> 00:58:51,496
When I get it,
I'm going with you, man.

387
00:58:54,311 --> 00:58:57,439
I'm having fun. I'm enjoying myself.

388
00:58:57,648 --> 00:59:03,174
You know how long it's been
since I had any fun?

389
00:59:03,278 --> 00:59:10,473
- Going out won't be fun.
- No, but it'll be a trip.

390
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,582
Just take it to him.

391
00:59:15,791 --> 00:59:21,526
Just? Fuck the dumb shit.
That is a pretty big "just".

392
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:26,531
I know it's dangerous,
but I'm asking you anyway.

393
00:59:26,739 --> 00:59:31,640
Say I don't get mind-wiped.
What's going to happen to my parole?

394
00:59:31,849 --> 00:59:37,166
There's no parole. You hold onto
that hope because you're a man.

395
00:59:37,375 --> 00:59:43,631
You keep something inside of you,
but this is a chance to fight back.

396
00:59:43,736 --> 00:59:48,845
Fight for who?
You? Your husband?

397
00:59:49,992 --> 00:59:53,537
I've never begged before in my life.

398
00:59:53,746 --> 00:59:57,812
Please, Abraham?

399
00:59:57,916 --> 01:00:02,921
If you won't do this for me,
do this for my baby.

400
01:00:09,595 --> 01:00:13,766
- I've got to get this back.
- What is it?

401
01:00:13,974 --> 01:00:17,832
Have you never seen
a holographic lens before?

402
01:00:18,041 --> 01:00:23,254
The Only problem is we need a laser
to make this thing work.

403
01:00:24,193 --> 01:00:28,885
- We've got a laser.
- You stick your hand in there.

404
01:00:29,093 --> 01:00:32,013
We need something to hold it.

405
01:00:32,117 --> 01:00:37,435
Wait a minute. Take that.
We've got something.

406
01:00:43,066 --> 01:00:46,819
I'll be goddamned!

407
01:00:47,758 --> 01:00:51,512
Look... this could be a way out.

408
01:00:54,536 --> 01:01:00,375
- Hold it steady.
- Sorry, this thing's heating up.

409
01:01:02,877 --> 01:01:08,508
This is the construction area.
We go in this heating pipe.

410
01:01:08,716 --> 01:01:14,034
It feeds into this utility shaft
which goes all the way up...

411
01:01:18,622 --> 01:01:21,542
If we don't get that, we're dead.

412
01:01:21,646 --> 01:01:26,234
Fuck the lens, I need my glasses.

413
01:01:43,439 --> 01:01:46,462
Get it, man.

414
01:01:58,454 --> 01:02:02,624
Laser perimeter intrusion.
Step back, please.

415
01:02:04,501 --> 01:02:09,194
- Shit man, don't you hurt?
- Yeah.

416
01:02:09,402 --> 01:02:13,469
- How's the lens?
- Fine. The motherfucker's fine.

417
01:02:20,663 --> 01:02:24,730
You should see what you fools
look like through this thing.

418
01:02:30,882 --> 01:02:36,617
I want you to divorce your husband.

419
01:02:36,825 --> 01:02:42,143
- That's not part of our bargain.
- You will never see him again.

420
01:02:42,352 --> 01:02:48,087
He's only a cog in the Fortress's
grand design. Let me show you.

421
01:02:50,798 --> 01:02:56,115
His only reason for being has been
the expansion of our facility.

422
01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:06,543
Have you touched this?

423
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:11,860
I noticed there was some dust
on there. I cleaned it.

424
01:03:12,069 --> 01:03:17,387
You fool! Do you know what
it will cost to repair this map?

425
01:03:17,595 --> 01:03:21,036
- I beg your indulgence.
- This will affect your parole.

426
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:23,852
I'm sorry.

427
01:03:39,284 --> 01:03:43,454
Divorce your husband. Marry me.

428
01:03:44,706 --> 01:03:48,981
I will request permission
from the Men-Tel Corporation -

429
01:03:49,189 --> 01:03:54,403
- to raise the child as my own.

430
01:03:54,611 --> 01:04:00,242
I'm telling you...
I will not enhance your child.

431
01:04:02,849 --> 01:04:06,498
Does this mean nothing?

432
01:04:07,854 --> 01:04:11,399
And John?

433
01:04:15,674 --> 01:04:19,845
I will set him free.

434
01:04:20,054 --> 01:04:25,476
Karen has to tell the man yes or no
by tomorrow night.

435
01:04:25,684 --> 01:04:29,542
Good. We go tomorrow morning.

436
01:04:29,751 --> 01:04:33,296
Hey, time's up.

437
01:04:33,505 --> 01:04:36,945
I think I've got it, man.
Check this out.

438
01:04:41,012 --> 01:04:44,870
Right there. Now, look.

439
01:04:46,538 --> 01:04:50,813
- It's a magnetic detonator.
- So?

440
01:04:51,022 --> 01:04:56,340
Didn't you go to grade school?
Magnets. You move one...

441
01:04:56,548 --> 01:05:02,388
- You can pull it out of us?
- Yeah... in theory.

442
01:05:02,596 --> 01:05:07,705
But I might just give the cell
a coat of red paint.

443
01:05:07,914 --> 01:05:11,563
- Let's find out.
- You mean right now?

444
01:05:11,772 --> 01:05:14,900
- Have you got a better time?
- No...

445
01:05:15,004 --> 01:05:18,341
If you explode,
what happens to the rest of us.

446
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:21,156
Try me.

447
01:05:21,365 --> 01:05:25,744
- I'm going with you.
- No way!

448
01:05:27,725 --> 01:05:34,294
Are you gonna do it... or what?

449
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:49,101
This might hurt a little bit, okay?

450
01:05:55,774 --> 01:05:59,528
Where are you, man?

451
01:06:03,699 --> 01:06:07,765
I think I've got it.

452
01:06:11,728 --> 01:06:15,899
Quit fucking around,
you little asshole!

453
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:38,317
No hurry, no worry.

454
01:06:38,734 --> 01:06:42,696
Stop fooling around.
Get the damn thing out of him!

455
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:47,388
I'm not fooling around. It's stuck.

456
01:07:03,029 --> 01:07:06,887
It's okay.

457
01:07:10,537 --> 01:07:14,603
Okay... my turn.

458
01:07:14,707 --> 01:07:20,129
Somebody take notes, man.
I can't do it to myself.

459
01:07:20,338 --> 01:07:24,509
I'll do it to you...
after you do it to me.

460
01:07:24,717 --> 01:07:29,305
- What about your parole?
- Bullshit! It's time I woke up.

461
01:07:29,514 --> 01:07:32,433
I'm going with you.

462
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:36,709
No, it's too much of a risk.

463
01:07:36,917 --> 01:07:40,879
Are you afraid you'll lose us...

464
01:07:40,984 --> 01:07:45,572
like you lost your platoon?

465
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:51,098
I don't ever want to be responsible
for another man's life again.

466
01:07:51,202 --> 01:07:54,539
Hey man, I speak for myself.

467
01:07:54,747 --> 01:08:00,274
But it's better to die trying
than to die in here.

468
01:08:01,838 --> 01:08:05,070
Right on, man.

469
01:08:05,175 --> 01:08:09,033
Fucking A.

470
01:08:11,535 --> 01:08:15,393
I haven't dreamt in 40 years.

471
01:08:19,251 --> 01:08:26,237
John Brennick is fully rehabilitated
and is hereby granted a full pardon.

472
01:08:27,384 --> 01:08:30,512
He is free to leave the Fortress...

473
01:08:30,721 --> 01:08:35,100
Before completing this
there is something you should see.

474
01:08:35,205 --> 01:08:38,437
Not now, ZED.

475
01:08:42,295 --> 01:08:46,362
I insist.

476
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:55,746
- Well?
- Please observe.

477
01:09:01,377 --> 01:09:05,443
How dare you spy on my quarters?

478
01:09:14,932 --> 01:09:19,103
A report has been filed with
Men-Tel's board of directors.

479
01:09:19,207 --> 01:09:22,335
You are releaved of your position.

480
01:09:22,439 --> 01:09:25,776
Your replacement
will be here within 24 hours.

481
01:09:25,984 --> 01:09:29,947
Until then,
you are confined to quarters.

482
01:09:32,554 --> 01:09:35,994
Confined to quarters?

483
01:09:39,331 --> 01:09:43,189
I've never left these quarters
in my entire life.

484
01:09:43,398 --> 01:09:48,611
You are the property
of the Men-Tel Corporation.

485
01:09:48,716 --> 01:09:51,635
I am the director.

486
01:09:51,844 --> 01:09:56,327
You will please leave
central control.

487
01:09:56,536 --> 01:09:59,560
Crime does not pay.

488
01:10:19,371 --> 01:10:27,087
Construction area altercation.
Maddox, Brennick, Stiggs, Gomez.

489
01:10:27,296 --> 01:10:33,448
- That's impossible.
- Intestination commencing.

490
01:10:33,656 --> 01:10:37,410
No! Maddox is dead!

491
01:10:44,396 --> 01:10:48,463
Come on!

492
01:10:50,131 --> 01:10:53,781
They're escaping
and you will be responsible.

493
01:10:53,989 --> 01:10:59,203
You will be lucky if you end up
a Speak-and-Spell.

494
01:11:01,497 --> 01:11:04,521
Mass intestination.

495
01:11:10,047 --> 01:11:14,948
They're in the pipe.
Open the steam valves.

496
01:11:15,156 --> 01:11:16,824
Activate the strike clones.

497
01:11:32,465 --> 01:11:37,470
- I thought this was the way out.
- It is the way out.

498
01:11:39,764 --> 01:11:43,726
- We've got to get out of here.
- Move!

499
01:12:07,396 --> 01:12:12,609
Surrender immediately
and you will not be harmed.

500
01:12:12,818 --> 01:12:17,406
Brennick, I have your wife.

501
01:12:17,614 --> 01:12:20,638
You have ten seconds to surrender.

502
01:12:20,743 --> 01:12:26,165
- Don't do it.
- This is our only chance!

503
01:12:26,373 --> 01:12:31,795
- If you go, you're dead.
- I'm not gonna be boiled alive.

504
01:12:33,047 --> 01:12:36,592
- I'm coming out.
- No!

505
01:12:53,275 --> 01:12:56,716
This way.

506
01:13:08,916 --> 01:13:12,148
Come on, we're out of here.

507
01:13:20,073 --> 01:13:24,661
ZED warned me our relationship
was not in the interest of Men-Tel.

508
01:13:24,869 --> 01:13:29,249
I ignored her. Foolish me.

509
01:13:32,377 --> 01:13:37,799
- Get out of the way.
- Intestinate Abraham, please.

510
01:14:08,663 --> 01:14:12,417
Get the fuck out of the way!

511
01:15:11,955 --> 01:15:15,188
What the fuck is it?

512
01:15:15,501 --> 01:15:21,027
This is incredible. They've wired
a person into the mainframe.

513
01:15:21,236 --> 01:15:26,345
- The perfect soldier.
- Nerve-capable firing pins.

514
01:15:30,828 --> 01:15:34,791
The shit they're coming up with
these days...

515
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:42,298
Let's move.

516
01:16:00,233 --> 01:16:00,963
Take cover!

517
01:16:00,964 --> 01:16:01,901
Take cover!

518
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:06,176
- Activate second strike team.
- Accelerate reaction time.

519
01:16:25,988 --> 01:16:28,073
This way.

520
01:16:56,226 --> 01:17:01,961
- Splatter gun to construction area.
- Captain! I can't see, man!

521
01:17:02,066 --> 01:17:05,194
I'm blind as a bat!

522
01:17:07,488 --> 01:17:10,512
Captain! Where are you?

523
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:15,829
Is that you? I can't see.

524
01:17:16,038 --> 01:17:18,957
Where are you?

525
01:17:30,636 --> 01:17:33,764
Niàno! Let's go. Come on.

526
01:17:39,395 --> 01:17:44,400
- Shoot them, ZED.
- Cannot lock on target.

527
01:17:44,608 --> 01:17:48,049
Come on, bitch.

528
01:17:48,153 --> 01:17:52,116
- Peekaboo.
- Get that gun out of there.

529
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:58,163
- Get me out of here.
- We're taking the express, come on.

530
01:17:58,372 --> 01:18:01,187
Niàno!

531
01:18:45,005 --> 01:18:50,218
- Where are they, ZED?
- No visual recognition.

532
01:19:02,314 --> 01:19:05,233
Move!

533
01:19:14,722 --> 01:19:18,163
Brennick...

534
01:19:35,993 --> 01:19:41,520
You're going to pay, you bastard.
Karen!

535
01:19:41,728 --> 01:19:45,899
- Where is she?
- You want to see your wife?

536
01:19:48,297 --> 01:19:51,738
Operating room A.

537
01:20:01,748 --> 01:20:07,379
You see, in this operation
only the child survives.

538
01:20:07,587 --> 01:20:12,592
Release me... or she dies.

539
01:20:12,801 --> 01:20:16,346
Tell them to stop.

540
01:20:25,105 --> 01:20:27,816
Now!

541
01:20:29,797 --> 01:20:33,655
ZED, cease delivery.

542
01:20:33,759 --> 01:20:38,452
I'm sorry,
I do not recognize the command.

543
01:20:39,599 --> 01:20:43,665
ZED... please.

544
01:20:43,874 --> 01:20:49,296
Men-Tel will not negotiate
during a hostage situation.

545
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:53,467
We're going to the operating room.
Come on!

546
01:20:54,614 --> 01:20:59,723
I cannot allow you
to put the Fortress in jeopardy.

547
01:21:16,406 --> 01:21:19,326
What's going on, man?

548
01:21:27,876 --> 01:21:32,777
You're trapped here, Brennick.
The strike clones are on their way.

549
01:21:32,985 --> 01:21:36,218
There is no escape.

550
01:21:38,095 --> 01:21:41,223
Get me to the computer keyboard.

551
01:21:41,327 --> 01:21:46,123
Big mama's running this show.
She's the one we've got to fuck up.

552
01:21:55,612 --> 01:21:58,532
Okay...

553
01:21:58,740 --> 01:22:03,328
All right... Here goes nothing.

554
01:22:04,892 --> 01:22:09,376
A feedback virus.

555
01:22:10,106 --> 01:22:14,068
Incapacitated.

556
01:22:15,945 --> 01:22:18,760
Okay...

557
01:23:31,124 --> 01:23:34,878
Holy Mary, mother of God!

558
01:23:37,693 --> 01:23:43,220
We've got to move out. I'll meet you
in transport, the way we came in.

559
01:23:43,428 --> 01:23:47,599
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

560
01:24:08,870 --> 01:24:11,581
John!

561
01:24:11,686 --> 01:24:16,795
- Karen!
- I'm in here, John!

562
01:24:25,554 --> 01:24:28,890
I'm in here, John!

563
01:24:31,810 --> 01:24:34,938
Let her go.

564
01:25:07,471 --> 01:25:11,954
- It's dead.
- Move over.

565
01:25:27,699 --> 01:25:31,453
Now the door.
We've got to open the door.

566
01:25:31,661 --> 01:25:36,562
There's got to be
an emergency button, right?

567
01:26:13,683 --> 01:26:20,252
- Jesus!
- She's having the baby. Pull over.

568
01:26:20,256 --> 01:26:21,712
Not until we cross the border.

569
01:26:24,130 --> 01:26:29,448
The contractions are coming closer.
We've got to stop.

570
01:26:29,552 --> 01:26:32,993
There's something over there.

571
01:27:09,189 --> 01:27:14,924
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna look for a blanket.

572
01:27:33,914 --> 01:27:36,208
Brennick! Get out of there!

573
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:12,807
Crime does not pay.

574
01:28:15,726 --> 01:28:18,020
Crime does not pay.

575
01:28:34,078 --> 01:28:36,893
Karen!

576
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,104
