1
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:15,910
碰
Pung

2
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,146
三条
3 bamboos

3
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:21,320
九章，小心呀
Watch it

4
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,412
怎么搞的？哪有打牌打成这样？
Do you know what you are doing?

5
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,315
我是照规矩打的
l just play by the rules

6
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:25,857
乱打一通，真气死人
You're all over the place, damn it

7
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:31,095
四条，开杠
4 bamboos, Kong

8
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:32,489
抢杠
Snatching a Kong

9
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:34,864
清一色，三辣
Full Flush, triple the points

10
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:36,567
这是你包的
You cover the payouts

11
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:37,693
不关我们的事
That is not our fault

12
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:38,327
自己找死
You're looking for trouble

13
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,099
人家九章落地还要开杠
He has 9 open tiles and you still Kong

14
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:41,738
包一铺三辣
You pay out for the triple points

15
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:42,899
不见二五六，惨了
lt's a pity losing $256

16
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:45,838
就是啊，明知大牌还开杠
Right, you still Kong in this suitation

17
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,175
笑话了，抢杠当自摸
No, snatching a Kong is same as
drawing by himself

18
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:49,748
每位是一百二十八
That's $128 each

19
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:51,544
三家一共是三百八十四
Which makes $384 for three

20
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,410
抢杠当自摸？
Snatching a Kong is considered as
drawing by himself?

21
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:56,384
对，抢杠当自摸
That's right

22
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:56,955
当然了
Naturally

23
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,285
人家摆明是九章嘛
That's obviously 9 tiles opened

24
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:58,686
是啊
That's right

25
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,282
人家九章你开杠
You Kong even he has 9 open tiles

26
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,223
当然是该你包了
Naturally you should cover the payout

27
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:03,921
照规矩我只出一二八
That's only $128 for me

28
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:04,654
这算什么呀？
What is this?

29
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:06,231
九章下地你要全包的
You should cover the payout

30
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:06,798
怎么？
What?

31
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,164
九章下地包出冲没有包自摸的
lt doesn't cover for drawing by himself

32
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,831
既然是当自摸
lf it is drawing by himself

33
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:12,905
我只出一二八，找两块
l am only paying $128

34
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,803
那么其他的钱我跟谁要呀？
Where am l supposed to get
the rest from?

35
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:16,233
当然是找他们两个人要了
From these two naturally

36
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:16,933
既然是当自摸
Since l draw by myself

37
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:18,943
每位一百二十八，对不对？
That is definitely $128 each

38
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,979
不对，当然是你包的嘛
No, it should all come from you

39
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,305
抢你的扛，当然是你包了
You are dreaming, you should pay

40
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,440
你包的，我不管
No, you pay all

41
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:25,381
我不管那么多
l don't care

42
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:26,884
总之我要收够三百八十四
l insist on getting $384

43
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,518
我也不管
l don't care either

44
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,053
我只出一百二十八
l pay $128 now

45
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:35,659
我告你们
l will sue you all

46
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,858
你为什么要收三八四
Why do you want to collect $384

47
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:42,366
而不是二五六？说
And not $256? Speak

48
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:45,363
因为我是抢杠胡牌
Since l've scored a hand
by snatching a Kong

49
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,461
牌例上讲明
According to the rules

50
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:47,870
抢杠当自摸的嘛
Snatching a Kong is considered as
drawing by himself

51
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:49,407
那么每家一百二十八
That will be $128 each

52
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,136
总数是三百八十四
Totally $384

53
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:52,040
对
Correct

54
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,377
你为什么不包三八四？
Why will you not cover $384?

55
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:57,581
因为当她是自摸的嘛
Because she draw by herself

56
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:00,215
打麻将规定十二章才包自摸
The rules say it should cover the pay
for 12 open tiles

57
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,511
九章为什么要包呀？
Not for 9 open tiles

58
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,645
一二八没有少给她
$128 is enough

59
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:04,487
也有道理
You have a point

60
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,953
那你们两个为什么不给一二八？
Why don't you pay $128?

61
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,518
不是我们犯错
That is not our fault

62
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,788
又不是她自摸
And she isn't draw by herself

63
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,659
是呀，明明是九章落地
Yes, there's 9 open tiles

64
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:12,696
为什么要我们给？
Why should we pay?

65
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,025
你们也有道理
You have a point too

66
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,267
你们四个全对
You four are all correct

67
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:21,873
肃静...
Silence...

68
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:27,236
本庭听过原告及各被告之证供
Hearing the plaintiff
and defendants' arguments

69
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:30,544
而且又翻查过呈堂的证物
And having looked at the evidence

70
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,049
经过详细的考虑之后
After careful deliberation

71
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,518
判决如下
My verdict is...

72
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:38,353
第一被告要付三百八十四块
First defendant should pay $384

73
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,585
因为原被告九章落地
Because the plaintiff falls to ground
by nine tiles

74
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:42,160
你有责任包输的
You are responsible for paying the rest

75
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:45,527
而且牌例注明抢杠是当自摸
Besides, snatching a Kong is same as
drawing by himself

76
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:46,127
对不对
Was l not correct

77
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:47,392
我早说过不关我们的事
l told you it is not our fault

78
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,524
那当然啦
Of course

79
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,899
原告只能收二五六
The plaintiff can only collect $256

80
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,996
因为摸绝章四条的是第一被告
Because the last 4 bamboos
is draw by first defendent

81
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,131
而不是你
And not you

82
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,205
第二被告以及第三被告
The 2nd and 3rd defendant

83
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,280
各需付六十四
Each should pay $64

84
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,518
因为如果当原告自摸
Since the plaintiff is drawing the tile
by himself

85
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,882
你们一样要输一百二十八
You would have to pay 128 just the same

86
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,882
现在每位六十四
Now it's just $64 each

87
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:11,115
已经便宜你们了
That is letting you off easy

88
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,718
那多出来的一百五十六怎么算呢？
What about the outstanding $156?

89
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,184
本席充公
That is confiscated by this court

90
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,865
那有这样的？...
ls that reasonable?

91
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:24,626
不得上诉，退庭
No appeal. Court is adjourned

92
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,228

163
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,118
我这招叫做打劫红毛鬼

进贡法兰西

所谓无敌是最寂寞的

为什么事前不跟我说一声？
Why haven't you advised me beforehand?

189
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,903
你不觉得刚才的那个场合

190
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,700
最适合宣布这件事？

196

那你全都交给我管理？
So you will leave them for me to manage?

197
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:03,648
暂时还没决定
l have not decided yet

198
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:06,784
难道有第二个人？
Could there be another?

199
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:28,877
死胖子，矮子
Fat-so, shorty

200
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,346
你走路不看人？
Are you blind?

201
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:32,546
我就是因为看人
ln fact l was looking

202
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:33,583
要不然怎么会撞到你？
Otherwise how could l have

203
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,210
算了，不要吵了

他撞了人还那么凶

00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,252
兰丝，那怕那个三寸钉

什么三寸钉？
Who are you calling shorty?

208
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,121
你说我？
Are you yelling at me?

209
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,491
说声对不起
Just say sorry

210
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,086

What?

211
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:46,255
是你不对嘛
You are in the wrong

要说就你说
You say it

217
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,906
我积奇从来不认输的
l, Jackie never apologize

218
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,006
你不说就别想出去
lf you don't, you are not leaving

219
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,905
不出去就不出去，会死啊
So l will stay, l fear not

220
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,207
大不了再回英国
The worse is l will return to England

221
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:09,847
对不起
Sorry

222
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,752
我这位朋友小孩子脾气
He is like a kid

223
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,359
我代他向这位小姐道歉

224
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,857
小姐，真是不好意思

225
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:24,998
干爹，媚姨

226
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:25,866

00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,911
我叫你回来是想告诉你
The reason l have asked you
to come back...

230
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,242
我决定退休了

231
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,509
您要退休？
You are retiring?

232
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:44,680
麻雀馆和俱乐部全交给你媚姨管理
Aunt May will manage
the mahjong house and club

233
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,849
你不要回去念书了
Don't pursue your studies in England

234
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,057
留在这儿帮媚姨的忙，管管帐
Stay and help your Aunt May,
keep the books

235
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,827
麻雀馆不是普通生意
The mahjong business
is a specialised field

236
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,765
不熟悉这行根本没法去做
lt's difficult if you are not an expert

237
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,266
庄臣连一幅牌有多少章都不知道
Johnson does not know anything
about mahjong

238
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,202
叫他来帮忙，那不是...
To ask him to help, that...

239
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:04,273
我叫他管那儿的帐
l have asked him to watch the accounts

240
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:05,536
又不是叫他坐馆
Not oversee the operation

241
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,509
他是学电脑的
He specializes in computers

242
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,240
对那些数目字一定很敏感
And should be good with figures

243
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:10,380
说得那么容易
Easier said than done

244
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:11,414
我跟了你十年
l've followed you for 10 years

245
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,609
你还是不相信我？
You still do not trust me?

246
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,655
庄臣，以后你就管帐

247
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:20,986
其他的事由媚姨作主

248
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:21,885

这位是...
This is...

251
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,031
老爷的干儿子
the step son of master

252
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:27,826
他叫阿辉
His name is Ah Fai

253
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,493
是你媚姨的得力助手
And is your Aunt May's side kick

254
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:31,695
哦，庄少爷
Oh, master Yau

255
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:33,093

This is a good business day

一直都是这样
lt's been like this

257
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,174
如果不是这样
lf not for this...

258
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,641
你媚姨也不会要死要活的霸着
Your Aunt May would not have
struggled to grab it

259
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:46,981
别生气嘛
Don't be angry

260
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:49,277
你干爹有九间麻雀馆
Your Godpa has 9 mahjong houses

261
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,286
三间俱乐部

262
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:51,782
你看看
Take a look

263
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:56,284
日夜都这么热闹，生意好起来

00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,587
每个月都有两百多万的进帐

00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,352
马不停蹄，马上就来看着了
You have come to check
without delay, huh !

268
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:25,915
根叔带我来看看
Uncle Jin is showing me around

269
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,419
说不定以后你就是老板了
You might be the future boss

270
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,623
到时候我牌瘾来了想玩几铺
When l have the urge to play
a couple of hands

271
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,595
不知道可不可以呢，根叔
...would you allow me, Uncle Jin

272
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:34,597
不敢当，媚姨
You are too kind, Aunt May

273
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,634
在英国好吃好住
You have an easy life in England

274
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:39,567
何必回来跟我争这口辛苦饭
Why return and vie for this difficultjob

275
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,831
谁跟你争呀？
Who is vying with you?

276
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,369
我是尊重干爹的意思

277
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:44,941

你以为那么容易吃的吗？
Do you think it is easy?

279
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,952
光是这两下子就够你学了
Only this would take you
some time to learn

280
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,788
用点心吧
Apply yourself

281
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,414
要不然有人会很失望的
Or else someone
would be very disappointed

282
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:43,060
有人出老千...
Someone is cheating

283
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:10,585
丘太太，你找我？
Mrs. Yau, you've been looking for me?

284
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:12,085
今天晚上有几个大客
There are some big clients tonight

285

你到上面准备一下

286
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,397
玩真的还是玩假的？
Are you playing for real?

287
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,128
真也好，假也好
Regardless

288
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,464
总之我要赢
l want to win

289
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:19,734
好，我会办妥的
OK. l will make
the necessary preparations

290
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,502
庄臣，你留十万块钱给我
Johnson, leave me $100,000

291
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,609
干什么？我已经结好帐了
For what? l have closed the book

292
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,581
不是要等你干爹开口你才肯给吧？
Would it take Godpa to instruct you?

293
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,045
庄少爷
Master Yau

294
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,313
你就照媚姨的意思去做吧
Do as your Aunt May says

295
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,649
拿着鸡毛当令箭
Playing the boss

296
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,155
今晚这两个家伙有灾受了
These two guys are in trouble tonight

297
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,166
九筒
9 circles

298
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,141
你媚姨现在向阿辉要九条

299
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,107

怎么打得出去呢
How can you play like this?

306
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,292
又动手脚了
There you go again

307
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,229
算了吧，弃权了
Forget it, give it up

308
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,790
混一色对对胡自摸发财
Full Flush, All sets

309
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,061
刚刚好八番
Eight points

310
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,470
发财你也摸得着
You are lucky to draw the Green Dragon

311
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:27,504
这怎么打得过你呀
How can we beat you

312
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,365
真是，听四章牌都胡不过你
l lost even though

313
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:31,438

314
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:34,875
碰

两番
Two points

319
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:50,520
怎么搞的？
What has happened?

320
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,056
你看我这幅牌多漂亮？
Look how beautifully l am set up !

321
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:52,789
我也漂亮啊
Me too

322
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:53,660
你怎么这么打牌？
Why do you play like this?

323
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:55,192
你什么牌？
What do you have?

324
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:56,228
我看看
Let me see

325
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:57,824
你看我的牌干什么？
Why do you look at mine?

326
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:58,960
你管我打什么牌？
What do you care how l play?

327
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,631
你教我打啊
You show me

328
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,229
难道我打八筒啊？
Did you want me to discard 8 Circles?

329
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:03,497
打下一铺吧
Play the next game

330
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,240
别乱打，九章了
Don't mess around

331
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:11,505
干吗那是假的
He is faking it

332
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:12,849
二万
Twenty thousand

333
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:13,713
碰
Pung

334
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:15,653
这回轮到你包十二章了
This time you will lose

335
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:17,885
六万
Sixty thousand

336
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,389
四条
4 bamboos

337
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:39,275
摸来了
l get it

338
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,140
我以为要包自摸
l thought l had to cover all winnings

339
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:44,840
原来还有钱收啊
But it looks l have money to collect

340
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,175
四圈都不开胡
You didn't win in four rounds

341
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:48,981
一开胡就来个诈胡
Foul in the opening round

342
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,094
这间弹子房是郭柱开的
This joint was started by Mr. Kwok Chu

343
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:03,828
你媚姨时常上来
Your Aunt May comes frequently

344
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,937
根叔，她是不是上来打弹子
Uncle Jin, she has not come for the games

345
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,206
她醉翁之意不在酒
Her interest is not in the games

346
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:10,070
明白吗？
Do you get it?

347
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:45,205
真厉害
You are good

348
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:10,793
谁？
Who is it?

349
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,802
救命呀...
Help ...

350
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:20,639
郭先生
Mr. Kwok

351
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,002
你是谁？
Who are you?

352
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,240
他是我们少爷的朋友
He is our young master's friend

353
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:24,647
我是问你？
l am asking you

354
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,775
我叫JackyChan
l am Jacky Chan

355
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:30,847
媚姨
Aunt May

356
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:35,856
庄少爷
Master Yau

357
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,028
你怎么会到这儿来玩？
Why have you come here?

358
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:39,488
我不来
lf l didn't come

359
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:40,997
怎么看得见这么好的戏？
Would l have seen such a good show?

360
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:41,724
少爷
Young Master

361
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:43,359
难道你不知道你干妈
Don't you know your Godma

362
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,129
要开一间弹子房吗？
Wants to run a pool joint as well?

363
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,637
原来干妈想开...
So Godma wants to open ...

364
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,268
我是说开弹子房
l am saying open a pool joint

365
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,801
怪不得老来找郭先生
No wonder she frequently sees Mr. Kwok

366
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,903
你年纪轻轻
Young as you are

367
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:56,646
得点颜色就想开染房
You are over ambitious

368
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:57,177
既然你知道
Since you know

369
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:58,715
就不应该这样对我干爹
You shouldn't treat my Godpa like this

370
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:03,211
管理麻雀馆
To run a mahjong house

371
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:07,452
牌术要精，眼要灵，反应要快
You need to be good at the game
& have quick reflexes

372
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:10,227
还要对付那些千王千霸
And deal with those con men

373
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:13,287
不是你想像中那么容易
lt is more difficult than you think

374
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:15,092
我知道不容易
l know it isn't easy

375
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,497
不过我想试一试
But l want to try

376
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,831
是啊，我们少爷那么聪明
Yes, our master is smart

377
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,234
我相信他很快就学会
l am sure he will learn quickly

378
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:20,998
根叔
Uncle Jin

379
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:23,574
你也算是打了几十年牌
You have played mahjong for many years

380
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,575
还是拿不到雀爷名衔
But have not been crowned
King of Mahjong

381
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:28,673
你真的有兴趣？
Are you really interested?

382
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,338
本来没有，现在有
Not before, but l am now

383
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:31,648
为什么？
Why?

384
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,116
我觉得麻将是一种高尚的娱乐
Mahjong is a high class entertainment

385
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:35,914
可以训练精密的头脑
lt can drill the brain

386
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,079
灵活的思考
To be agile

387
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,451
又可以敦众睦邻
Widen your network and make friends

388
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,816
培养合作精神
Develop team spirit

389
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:43,456
那就是说你干爹开麻将馆让人赌钱
Are you saying
your Godpa's mahjong business

390
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:44,586
是不对了？
... is wrong?

391
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,560
不是
Not at all

392
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,598
只要光明磊落，大公无私
So long as it is transparent and fair

393
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,666
都是正行生意
lt is a legitimate business

394
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,170
只怕有些人借题发挥，伤天害理
Except for those who do immoral things

395
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:55,501
哦，这是你来抽我的后腿
So you are setting me up

396
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:56,835
告我的状
Telling on me

397
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,938
我做错什么？
What have l done wrong?

398
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,273
说出来怕你丢脸
lt would be bad for you if l told

399
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:05,214
庄少爷
Master Chong

400
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,751
我看你是吃不到葡萄说葡萄酸
The way l see it, it's just sour grapes

401
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:10,416
借题发挥的是你不是我
You are the one trying to cause trouble

402
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:13,183
不要在这儿针锋相对了
Stop your confrontation now

403
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,491
庄臣，你既然有意思
Johnson, since you are interested

404
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:18,222
我给你六个月的时间学习
l will give you 6 months to learn

405
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:22,266
在十月二十七号正午
At noon on 27th October

406
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:24,335
你和媚姨在麻将台上
You and Aunt May will decide by mahjong

407
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,563
决定谁来继承我的生意
Who will succeed my business

408
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,265
当今的麻将大师
The current mahjong experts

409
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:31,171
除了你干爹，郭柱
Apart from your Godpa, Kwok Chu

410
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:33,210
跟回去美国的徐成义之外
And Tsui who has returned to the States

411
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:35,506
还有一个来无踪去无影的燕西楼
There is a Yin Xi Liu

412
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:37,974
不过他们都不可能教你
But none of them can teach you

413
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,675
现在我带你去见那个人
The one l am taking you to

414
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:40,410
就是你干爹
ls your Godpa

415
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:43,420
当年纵横港澳雀坛的老伙计
Once Mahjong King of Hong Kong and Macau

416
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:44,454
平五
Ping Wu

417
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:47,117
麻将这个玩意儿
Mahjong is something

418
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:48,954
我是好久都不玩
l haven't played for a long time

419
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,125
一个人做了赌徒
A gambler

420
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:54,994
今天就不知道明天的事
Doesn't know what will happen tomorrow

421
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,129
你知道啦
And you know

422
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:58,202
要用酒来麻醉自己
He sometimes needs booze
to forget himself

423
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,865
手又抖，眼又花
His hands shake and his eyes are dim

424
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:02,496
还怎么出去混呢？
How can he prevail?

425
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:04,173
到后来呢
Until at last

426
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,107
不知道戒赌好
He doesn't know whether to quit gambling

427
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:07,405
还是戒酒好
Or stop drinking

428
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,446
少爷，你有福气
Master, you are lucky

429
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:10,480
有福气？
Lucky?

430
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:11,344
我怎么有福气？
How so?

431
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,645
平五爷这个人
Ping Wu

432
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:15,344
如果他不喜欢你
lf he doesn't like you

433

不过也不必给他机会

你慢慢来嘛，这个不能够心急

你以为我不知道？

577
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:11,418
我还听说那小子
l also hear, the kid...

578
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:13,285
派了很多人在找燕西楼
is looking for Yin

579
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:15,653
他真的找燕西楼？
He really wants to find Yin ?

580
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:16,991
你打算怎么办？
What are you going to do about it?

581
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:19,522
有什么打算？
Any plan up your sleeve?

582
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,694
让我去告诉他燕西楼在哪儿
Let me tell him where Yin is

583
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:24,966
是一个通天小子告诉我的
An informant told me

584
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:27,230
找到刀疤佬就可以找到燕西楼
Find Scar Face and you'll find Yin

585
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,101
他说那个刀疤佬
He said Scar Face as a rule...

586
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:32,199
照例在一定好那里吃宵夜
Eats at this restaurant

587
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,308
都说明是刀疤佬了
By definition, Scar Face

588
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:35,606
绝不是善男信女
ls not a nice guy

589
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:37,237
我怕他不肯见我们
l fear he might not see us

590
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:39,616
外头人就不见
He wouldn't see outsiders

591
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:40,877
自己人就不同了
But for his buddies it's different

592
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,150
你算自己人？
You're one of the gang?

593
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:45,153
有师傅照着
With teacher behind us

594
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:47,247
不算十足也有八成
We can pass for one

595
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,290
哪个师傅呀？
Which teacher?

596
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,392
你看看
Look

597
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:52,554
我背了一个晚上
l memorized it the whole night

598
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,428
头发未干出世迟
Born late with hair still wet

599
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:00,026
家贫少读五经书
Poor with little education

600
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:02,538
还望义兄来指引
Hoping brother could guide me

601
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,904
犹记花亭结义时
Remember our brotherly pledge

602
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:07,942
真的一样
Sounds genuine

603
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:10,211
还不是为你
All because of you

604
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:19,487
一六四七
1647

605
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,715
你猜有没有人认得出我是探长呢？
Think anyone will recognize me
as a detective?

606
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:23,927
有身份证的人都认得出你是探长
Anyone could

607
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:24,619
为什么？
Why?

608
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,924
第一，你进了屋里还戴着帽
Firstly you wear a hat indoors

609
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:31,099
第二，这里只有你一个人抽烟斗
Secondly you are the only one with a pipe

610
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,863
第三，现在又不下雨
Thirdly it is not raining

611
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:35,165
你穿什么风雨衣
But you're wearing a rain coat

612
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:35,830
不用脱
Keep it on

613
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,531
为什么？
Why?

614
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:37,505
他的意思是说
He means

615
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:39,337
当你是露体狂，就更加难看
lt's worse if you're taken for a flasher

616
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:40,433
对对对
Right...

617
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:46,408
一六四七，一六四九
1647, 1649

618
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:48,212
有人到，各就各位
Someone's arriving, take your places

619
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,081
探长，不像啊
Detective, this doesn't look like it

620
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:55,989
线人说是两个老头
The informant said two old guys

621
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,857
带着白粉来给刀疤佬的
Will come and give cocaine to Scar Face

622
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,758
你知不知道
Do you know why

623
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:01,422
为什么你做了二十年探员
You have been a detective for 20 years

624
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:02,863
还没有升级呀？
And yet haven't been promoted?

625
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,093
知道
Yes

626
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:05,965
因为每次我们跟强盗开火的时候
Each time we open fire on thugs

627
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,970
一定打伤两三个队员
We wound our own guys

628
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:10,540
还有啊，你lQ零蛋
Also your lQ is zero

629
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,769
不错，探长说得对
Detective is right

630
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:13,571
快去抓人吧
Go catch your man

631
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:16,371
等一下，你们现在想怎么办？
Wait, what do you want to do?

632
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:18,906
知不知道
Do you know why...

633
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:20,677
为什么我做了三十年的探长
Having been a detective for over 30 years

634
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,377
还升不上去做警务处长？
l am still not a Chief?

635
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:23,647
不知道
l don't know

636
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:25,585
因为我没有开除你们
That's because l haven't fired you guys

637
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:27,753
兄弟
Brother

638
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,686
什么兄弟？
What Brother?

639
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:32,324
反正是兄弟了
Just Brother

640
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,692
你知不知道我姓什么？
You know my surname?

641
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:35,930
总之姓什么也是兄弟
Regardless we're brothers

642
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:38,365
我姓元颜耶律督，九代单传
l am the devil-incarnate

643
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,333
什么兄弟？
What brother?

644
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:41,194
行
OK

645
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,466
四海之内皆兄弟
All men are brothers

646
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:45,906
姓什么也是一样，是不是？
Regardless of their names, right?

647
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,204
伙计，普洱
Waiter, Pu er tea

648
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,141
来了
Coming

649
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,757
你们两个是不是来捣乱的？
Are you two messing around?

650
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,482
不是，我们是来找人的
No, we're looking for someone

651
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:03,855
找人？找谁？
Who?

652
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,824
刀疤佬
Scar Face

653
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,096
刀疤佬？
Scar Face?

654
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:12,392
对，到底哪个才是呀？
Yes, where is he?

655
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,199
你们不会大声叫吗？
Why don't you call him?

656
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:20,840
刀疤佬
Scar Face

657
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,448
坏了
This looks bad

658
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:27,950
大疤，中疤，小疤
Big, medium and small scar faces

659
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:29,815
全来了，到底哪个才是呀？
Which one is Scar Face?

660
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:30,819
我是
l am

661
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,625
你就是刀疤佬呀？
You are Scar Face?

662
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:42,960
我叫刀疤成
l'm Scar Face

663
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,766
成哥，我们是自己弟兄
Brother Shing, we're brothers

664
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,393
有事想请你帮忙
We need your help

665
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:47,967
成哥
Brother Shing

666
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:50,973
这两个笨蛋是土包子
These two are bumpkins

667
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,737
不是，不是，我们不是土包子
No, no, we are not

668
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:54,876
有何为证？
What's your proof?

669
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,579
有诗为证
Poetry recitation

670
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:58,205
诗怎么说？
What does it say?

671
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:59,408
这...
Well...

672
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,383
头发生疮糯米池
Boils grow from my hair

673
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:06,923
家贫...
Family is poor...

674
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,190
家贫赌极都要输
But l keep losing when l gamble

675
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:16,327
万望...
l pray...

676
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:20,500
万望阿叔点醒我
You will guide me

677
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:22,234
犹记花亭结义时
Remember our pledge

678
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,498
犹记蜜桃成熟时
When the fruit is ripe

679
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:30,780
你们两个来捣乱的？
Are you two messing around?

680
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:32,178
不是，成哥
No, Brother Shing

681
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,444
他平时懒，这诗没念熟
He is lazy and hasn't memorized it well

682
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:48,593
你们两个来找我干什么？
What do you two want with me?

683
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:49,256
是不是想做
Do you want to become...

684
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:52,359
今年第一百六十八凶杀案的主角？
The 168th murder of the year ?

685
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:55,003
不是，我们是来找燕西楼的
No, we are here for Yin Xi Liu

686
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,537
燕西楼？
Yin Xi Liu?

687
00:37:58,643 --> 00:37:59,405
是啊
Yes

688
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:02,536
好了，他跟燕西楼一定是好朋友
Good, he must be friends with Yin

689
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,608
朋友
Good buddies

690
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,874
你知不知道我为什么叫刀疤成？
Do you know why l am called Scar Face?

691
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:07,908
我早就想问你
l had wanted to ask you

692
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:10,579
你的脸又白又滑嫩
Your face is fair and smooth

693
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,985
连一颗暗疮都没有
There is not even a pimple

694
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:13,553
坏在我这儿有
Too bad l have a scar here

695
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:17,493
这是燕西楼把我害成这样的
Caused by Yin

696
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:19,829
我发过誓
l swore

697
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:22,125
要把燕西楼的名字改成刀疤楼
l will scar Yin in revenge

698
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:24,459
就算做不到
Even if l don't

699
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:25,728
也要找他的亲戚朋友
l'll find his friends and relatives

700
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:27,064
姨妈姑姑来补数
To pay for his debt

701
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,505
我们不是他亲戚...
We are not his relatives...

702
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:34,139
你们准备改名字吧
Prepare to change your names

703
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,281
这可不是闹着玩的
This is no joke

704
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,214
快点走吧...
Let's get out of here...

705
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:47,786
他们在这儿，快点追
They are here, get them quick

706
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:04,800
线人说送白粉的怎会变成打架？
Did the informant expect this
to turn into a fight?

707
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:06,972
不要相信线人说的
Don't trust the informant totally

708
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:08,773
打架也是犯法，抓人
Fighting is also illegal, make arrests

709
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:22,253
不许动
Don't move

710
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:31,132
枪啊
Gun

711
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:34,632
积奇...
Jackie...

712
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,232
积奇，走啊
Jackie, flee

713
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:44,012
线人没说有人私藏军火
Nobody said anything about arms dealing

714
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:45,506
怎么会有人开枪？
Why did they open fire ?

715
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,048
好在还剩一颗子弹
Luckily there's a bullet left

716
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,278
探长，探长
Detective, detective

717
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,082
看开一点，何必自杀
Cheer up, why commit suicide

718
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:56,019
你告诉我，是谁给你这个消息的？
Tell me who gave you this information

719
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,574
吵醒你了

720
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:24,880
我想见见你
l wanted to see you

721
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,394
你有心要做的事一定会成功的
Put your heart into it
and you will succeed

722
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:37,293
不要遇到挫折就灰心
Don't give up when faced with hurdles

723
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:40,670
我不是灰心，是死心
l feel totally hopeless

724
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,163
你叫我到哪儿去找燕西楼？

我明天飞去法国，星期三回来

00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:58,614
是啊，一个钟头了
Yes, for an hour

729
00:40:58,722 --> 00:40:59,654
怎么那么迟？
What's the delay?

730
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:01,247
我临时调班，转了飞机
l switched flights

731
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:03,452
你的小朋友呢？

00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:04,357
在那边

我给你介绍，他是我大哥燕西楼
My brother Yin Xi Liu

735
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:34,584
平师傅有没有告诉你

736
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:36,319
我收徒弟是三不教
l don't teach 3 kinds of people

737
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:37,121
三不教？
3 kinds?

738
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:38,619
有没有硬币？
Got a coin ?

739
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:41,656
有啊
Yes

740
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:46,869
你伸出两只手指照我的意思做
Show me 2 fingers and listen

741
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:50,131
干什么？玩猜拳呀
What are we doing?

742
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:51,799
少开口，听我说
Be quiet. Listen

743
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:56,472
我放下硬币，你用手指夹着
Try to catch the coin with your fingers

744
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,840
一不教，手钝
l don't teach those slow-of-hand

745
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:03,848
我刚才不留意嘛
l wasn't prepared just now

746
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:05,781
再给我一次机会
Give me another chance

747
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:11,288
二不教，眼慢
l don't teach those with slow reflexes

748
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:14,527
你可以回去了
You can leave

749
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:16,691

三不教，记性差
l don't teach those who have bad memory

756
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:29,609
这三件事练不好
lf you can't improve in these areas

757
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,476
你根本就不可能打得好麻将
You can't be a good mahjong player

758
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:36,211

811
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:06,826
不错，就是你的妈

00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:08,165
你终于记得了

现在教你无影手的功夫

看着我，看着我

815
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:16,711
我要把你衬衫上的扣子

00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:18,441
一粒粒扯下来

照我刚才那样做一次，来呀

821
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:20,773
燕先生，燕先生
Mr Yin, Mr Yin

822
00:46:20,878 --> 00:46:22,209
我眼明手快记性好

通通都练过了

824
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,372
你可以教我打麻将了
You can teach me mahjong now

825
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,948
这个游泳池好脏，你替我洗干净它
Clean this swimming pool for me

826
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:33,415
是，燕先生

827
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:53,302
燕先生，那个游泳池洗好了
Mr Yin, the pool is cleaned

828
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:02,217
那边的草太长了，替我剪一下
The grass is too long there, mow the lawn

829
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,251
要每根一样
They must be of the same height

830
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,897
燕先生，那些草剪好了
Mr Yin, the grass is cut

831
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:20,568
你的牌在哪儿？我去拿
Where is the mahjong set? l'll get it

832
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:29,678
看这几天就要起风了
lt's been quite windy these few days

833
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,445
你替我拿把锯
Grab a saw

834
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:33,038
锯掉那些没用的树枝
And cut the dead branches

835
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,311
燕先生，我只剩三个月了
Mr Yin, l have only 3 months left

836
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:37,284
你再不教我，我怎么赢啊？
How can l win if you don't teach me?

837
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:40,782
那你回去吧，不用学
Then leave, you don't have to learn

838
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:43,823
对不起，燕先生
l'm sorry, Mr Yin

839
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:34,842
打麻将是讲究心眼手脑四合一
You need to coordinate heart, eyes,
hands and brain

840
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,437
眼明手快记性好你是练成
You have trained your reflexes and memory

841
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:40,339
可惜你头大无脑又心急如焚
But you're careless and impetuous

842
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:42,246
如果你不潜心苦练
lf you don't train hard

843
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:43,478
那就白废我的苦心
You'll waste my efforts

844
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:45,146
还不如收拾好行李
And it'll be better to pack up

845
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:46,813
回英国念电脑算了
And return to your studies in England

846
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,323
不行，我一定要打赢媚姨
No way, l must beat Aunt May

847
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:51,922
麻将是用来陶冶性情，训练身心
Mahjong is meant for recreation

848
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:53,394
不是用来赌博争胜
Not for gambling or winning

849
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:55,257
你想麻将打得好
To be a good mahjong player

850
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:56,297
就要记住这个原则
Remember this principle

851
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:57,192
知道了，燕先生
l understand, Mr Yin

852
00:48:57,968 --> 00:48:59,560
好了，明天收拾好行李
Right then, pack up the baggage and

853
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:00,728
搬到我这儿来住
prepare to move in here tomorrow

854
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:03,897
苦练三个月，看你是龙还是蛇
Train hard for 3 months
to see how you perform

855
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:09,604
那些树枝还没有锯好
Those branches are not yet cut

856
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:10,771
做完才能走
Leave after you have cut them

857
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:11,813
是，燕先生
Yes, Mr Yin

858
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:20,922
你大哥真是够烦的
Your brother is so demanding

859
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:22,352
我差点让他玩死
He was so difficult with me

860
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:23,619
好在我有耐力
Luckily l am patient

861
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:26,189
他肯教你，你已经是走运
You're fortunate he agrees to train you

862
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:29,221
不要学上次那个醉鬼师傅
Don't repeat the fiasco
with the drunkard teacher

863
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:30,800
那样搞法就好了
And it should be fine

864
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:31,731
他也不想的
He didn't want it that way either

865
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:33,264
我大哥念过很多书
My brother studied a lot

866
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:35,998
去过很多地方，见过很多人
Been to a lot of places
and met many people

867
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:38,336
看不起你，他不会教你
He wouldn't teach you
if he didn't like you

868
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:45,674
人家明天就上山修行去了
Tomorrow is the start of hard training

869
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:47,879
今晚千金一刻
Tonight is precious

870
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:50,810
我也不打扰你们了，再见
l wouldn't disturb you

871
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:57,794
等等我
Wait for me

872
00:49:59,062 --> 00:50:00,290
我还要回家收拾行李
l have to go home and pack my bags

873
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:01,923
你回去吧
You may return

874
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:03,659
我现在帮你去收拾好
l'll go and help you pack

875
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:05,632
明天早上再回来也不迟
We can still make it tomorrow

876
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:07,832
你进去高兴一会儿，去
Go and enjoy yourself

877
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:44,639
这三个月你就住在这儿
You'll live here for 3 months

878
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:47,671
让你见到的，梦到的
What you see and dream

879
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:50,110
踢到的，睡到的，闻到的都是麻将
feel, touch, dream and smell
will be mahjong

880
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:52,347
你跟它们多接触点
Make more contact with them

881
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:53,438
这样才能进步得快
And you'll progress quickly

882
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:54,913
知道了，燕先生
l understand, Mr Yin

883
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,573
十赌九骗这句话是骗人的
The saying
''nine out of ten cheat'' is false

884
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:55,674
骗人？
False?

885
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:57,274
十赌十骗才是真
Ten out of ten people cheat is true

886
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,446
我今天教你防千之术
Today you'll learn to prevent tricks

887
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,048
打麻将出老千不外乎两种
There are two ways to cheat in mahjong

888
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,515
麻牌俗称捉小鸡
lt's called catching the chick

889
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:08,282
通常麻牌是在翻牌的时候
When you flip the tiles

890
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:10,484
认定八章自己算好要的牌
you fix eight tiles that you want

891
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:11,989
例如八章条子
For example 8 tiles of bamboos

892
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:14,964
真的很像捉小鸡
lt's really like catching a chick

893
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:16,193
麻牌的时候
When you do this

894
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:17,789
不外乎触觉跟手法
lt's all in the reflexes

895
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:24,033
如果骰子打对了
Roll the dice right

896
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,075
要么自己拿，要么对家拿
lt's either us
or the opposite party to take

897
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:28,675
现在是五点
Now it is five

898
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:41,852
那不便宜了对家
Then you wouldn't give advantage
to the opposition

899
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:44,586
不会，如果骰子打错了
But if you roll the dice wrong

900
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:46,855
只要过一章牌就全都乱了
Then it becomes a mess

901
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:55,434
真是这样
lt's really like this

902
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:58,765
打牌碰到老千并不是一件坏事
Meeting a cheat may not be bad

903
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:00,172
最要紧的是镇定
The important thing is staying calm

904
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,844
有一次我在酒楼遇到三个老千
l met 3 cheats once

905
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:05,175
你猜发生什么事？
Guess what happened?

906
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:06,447
输清光了
All lost completely

907
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:10,819
这个不停拿筒子
This one is just after the Circles

908
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:14,385
他就专要条子
And he wants the Bamboos only

909
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:17,283
还有这家找万子
This guy was looking for Character tile

910
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:22,024
三个人都做清一色
They all want to make Full Flush

911
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:27,533
我呢就动也不用动
l didn't make a move

912
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:31,338
在八圈里面胡了五铺大三元
l win 5 games
with the Three Great Scholars

913
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:37,546
六铺大四喜
6 games of the Fourfold Homely Happiness

914
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:56,725
自摸清一色
Full Flush by drawing myself

915
00:53:56,833 --> 00:53:58,164
这招叫做一帆风顺
This is a good tactic

916
00:53:58,268 --> 00:53:59,064
有那儿不对呀？
What's wrong with it?

917
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:00,795
看不出
Can't see

918
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,432
你注意
Pay attention

919
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:03,706
我再做一次给你看
l'll do it again

920
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:09,141
刚才我不是上了七八九筒
Did l not get 7, 8 and 9 Circles

921
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,572
然后是五六七筒
Then 5, 6, 7 Circles

922
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:12,810
这副牌我根本就胡不出来
l can't win in the set

923
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:13,983
因为没有眼
since l don't have a pair of Eyes

924
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:16,281
但是刚才我摸了一章一筒
But l draw One Circle

925
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:17,216
把它搁在这儿
l placed the tiles here

926
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:19,112
我就手快一推
Quickly l shift 7 Circles to this side

927
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:21,520
把七筒一挪，我就有眼了吗
Then l get a pair of Eye tiles

928
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:23,917
这一招叫做一帆风顺
This is called the shifting technique

929
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:33,464
南
South

930
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:34,229
碰
Pung

931
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:38,303
七万
Seventy thousand

932
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:40,837
开杠
Kong

933
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,107
杠上番，自摸，平胡
l go Mah Jongg

934
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:46,677
三番
3 points

935
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:56,983
你平胡怎么开杠呀？
How can you go Mah Jongg like this?

936
00:54:57,394 --> 00:54:58,292
对呀
Right

937
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:01,861
我明白了
l see

938
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:04,026
足足二十四秒
24 full seconds

939
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:06,796
这招叫做借艇割禾
This tactic is called
''Borrow a boat to harvest rice''

940
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,765
那是在打了几圈之后
After several hands

941
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:11,135
个个都疲倦才用出来
Use it when all are tired

942
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:14,309
你这么晚才有反应
You only reacted after so long

943
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:16,208
牌已经推了，钱也给了
The tiles are mixed up,
and the money is paid

944
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,041
谁还理你？
Who will listen to you?

945
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:18,538
以后要提高警觉
Keep up your alertness

946
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,342
知道了，燕先生
l understand, Mr Yin

947
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:22,244
明天我去日本
l am going to Japan tomorrow

948
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:23,341
你自己勤力练习
Train hard on your own

949
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:24,752
回来考中期试
Then take the mid-term test

950
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:30,248
嗨    嗨
-Hi
-Hi

951
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:30,892
多喝一杯
One more glass

952
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:31,551
好的
Alright

953
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:34,519
玛丽关
Mary Kwan

954
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:35,188
干嘛？
What's up?

955
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:36,322
怎么不见你的死党来？
Where is your pal?

956
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:37,365
你见不到她不开心呀？
You are unhappy because she's not here?

957
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:38,957
不是，多一点人好玩点
No but, the more the merrier

958
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,271
那就是说我们不能令你开心了
This means we can't make you happy

959
00:55:42,372 --> 00:55:43,339
心照啦
We understand

960
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,202
看，刚说到她就来了
Look, speak of the devil !

961
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,206
那个人是谁？
Who's that?

962
00:55:51,314 --> 00:55:52,906
是人家的男朋友
Her boyfriend

963
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:54,449
老板

964

你不介意我带朋友来吧？
You don't mind l've brought a friend?

965
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:57,680
不要紧的，我姓赖

他的名字很好玩，叫蛤蟆
His nickname is funny though; it's toad

967
00:56:03,126 --> 00:56:06,152
那是我的乳名，叫我查理好了
That's just my nickname, call me Charlie

968
00:56:06,262 --> 00:56:07,354
赖蛤蟆先生，我叫庄臣
Mr. Toad, l am Johnson

969
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:09,359

00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:49,929
我不喜欢这个
l don't like this

974
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:51,063
你喜欢什么？
What do you like?

975
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:53,172
不告诉你，你会乱说
l won't tell you, you'll tease me

976
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:55,070
难道想跟我去九龙塘
Did you want to go to a hotel with me ?

977
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:56,467
我想回去练打麻将
l want to go home to play mahjong

978
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:00,515
想打牌也用不着回家
No need to go home for that

979
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:01,915
这儿不能打吗？

981
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:05,879
不打那么大
lf the stakes aren't high

982
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:07,513
怎么配得起我这副麻将呢
lt'll not do justice to my mahjong set

983
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:09,256
这要两万多块钱一副的
lt costs over 20,000 a set

984
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,321

谢谢老板
Thank you, boss

1008
00:58:32,475 --> 00:58:34,375
对不起，地胡
Sorry

1009
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:35,807
怎么搞的？
What's up?

1010
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,242
不是有歌唱嘛
Wasn't there a song which goes...

1011
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,213
开档的牌摆在当中
The center tile here
to be put in Closed Wait

1012
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,550
这个看相的真灵
The fortune teller was pretty accurate

1013
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,248
他说这个月份
He said this month...

1014
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,755
逢单日这间房都对我不利
This room wouldn't be lucky for me
on odd days

1015
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:48,414
是啊
Right

1016
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:49,423
为了公平起见
For fairness sake

1017
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:50,493
我们搬出去打
Let's move outside

1018
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:54,460
老板，可以了吧？
Boss, OK?

1019
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:54,962
差不多了
More or less

1020
00:58:55,064 --> 00:58:55,928
在这儿吧
Let's do it here

1021
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:58,025
可以了
This will do

1022
00:59:00,503 --> 00:59:02,164
好，好
Alright

1023
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:05,405
真是
Trouble

1024
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:07,307
什么牌
What tile to discard?

1025
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:08,042

1032
00:59:22,525 --> 00:59:23,651
包发财

一万
Ten thousand

1034
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:31,428
我四圈没有胡牌了
l haven't won once in four rounds

1035
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:34,392
跟着你打一万

三筒

00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:43,937
陈主任下个礼拜就退休了
Chief Chan will retire next week

1038
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:45,742
不知道找谁坐他的位置
Wonder who will succeed him

1039
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:52,747
没办法啦，谁叫自己是大牌呢
l will get the high score

1040
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:55,622
包也得打，发财
Green Dragon

1041
00:59:57,493 --> 00:59:58,482
除非我不胡
l must go Mah Jongg by...

1042
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,153
一胡就是大三元
the Three Great Scholars

1043
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:02,125
那就得我包啦
Then l have to cover the payout

1044
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:04,163
我这儿就不用你包
You need not since l'm here

1045
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,360
不过害得你做不了主任了
But l make you
lost the chances to promote

1046
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:07,868

1050
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:21,478
换地方

1051
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:24,544
又胡了，对不起，赖先生
Sorry again, Mr Lai

1052
01:00:32,562 --> 01:00:35,429
真是天助我也，九子连环
Oh God, it's Calling Nine Tile Hand

1053
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:37,889
你们谁打我都不胡
l must Mah Jongg by myself

1054
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:39,497
我打红中

1055
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:40,226
碰
Pung

1056
01:00:40,703 --> 01:00:41,260
碰干什么？
What for?

1057
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:42,269
一会儿你就知道
You'll know in a while

1058
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:45,902
八条
8 bamboos

1059

快点快点

01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:49,873
西风
West

1061
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:52,704
碰，该我胡了吧
Pung, l would win

1062
01:00:56,552 --> 01:00:58,042
这次发达了
l've hit the jackpot this time

1063
01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,754
每人两千五百六
That'll be 2,560 each

1064
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:08,121
我自摸双辣
l win by double scores

1065
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:10,090
你怎么自摸双辣呀？
How come?

1066
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,867
我九子连环全部万子
l'm Calling Nine Tile Hand

1067
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:13,299
我自摸一万不就胡了吗
l draw the Ten thousands tile then l win

1068
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:15,567
我怎么知道是不是九子连环？
How can l be sure of that?

1069
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,765
我早就说过，你们谁打我都不胡
l said to you before

1070
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:19,637
我自摸一万不就胡牌了
l will win by drawing Ten thousand tile

1071
01:01:20,743 --> 01:01:22,335
我还说我有三个一万
l'm also saying
l have 3 Ten thousand tiles

1072
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:24,037
你信不信呀？赖先生
Don't you believe, Mr Lai?

1073
01:01:25,982 --> 01:01:27,279
我不管，我胡的
l don't care. l win

1074
01:01:30,586 --> 01:01:32,247
所谓快棋慢马吊
Playing chess fast and mahjong slow

1075
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:33,447
纵高也不妙
Despite good skills you're likely to lose

1076
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:35,887
就是说下棋要慢
That is to say
you should be slow at chess

1077
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:36,981
打麻将一定要快
But quick at mahjong

1078
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:40,754
我在日本买了一部麻将电脑机回来
l've brought a mahjong computer
from Japan

1079
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:42,228
训练一下你打麻将的速度
To test your speed

1080
01:01:46,335 --> 01:01:47,529
我现在示范一次给你看
l'll demonstrate once

1081
01:01:48,638 --> 01:01:49,502
现在开牌
Setting the tiles

1082
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:58,237
摸牌
Drawing the tiles

1083
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:01,210
打牌
Playing the tiles

1084
01:02:08,624 --> 01:02:09,613
上牌
Chowing

1085
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:14,563
摸牌
Drawing the tiles

1086
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:18,992
听牌
Asking the tiles

1087
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:21,026
胡牌
Mah Jongg

1088
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:27,876
我也听说燕西楼
l've heard Yin

1089
01:02:27,977 --> 01:02:29,444
教了那小子不少东西
Taught the kid a lot

1090
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:31,607
一个生意人
A business man

1091
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:32,840
又不是吃这行饭
Doesn't need this for a living

1092
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,478
不必在这儿惹事生非
Shouldn't create unnecessary trouble

1093
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:43,654
要不要我找人去修理他一下
Do you want me to take care of him ?

1094
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:50,059
也好
Might as well

1095
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:53,332
既然燕西楼叫我下不了台
Since Yin has opposed me

1096
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:55,059
我也不必饶他
l don't need to be merciful with him

1097
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:58,369
那怎么个算法，郭少爷？
How will l be rewarded?

1098
01:03:01,644 --> 01:03:04,135
阿辉，你怎么这样跟我说话？
Ah Fai, why do you talk to me like this?

1099
01:03:05,381 --> 01:03:07,713
将来丘家的麻将馆全在我手里
When l gain control of
Yau's mahjong business

1100
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:08,784
你怕我待薄你？
You think l will not repay you well?

1101
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:12,378
有这话就行了
That's a deal then

1102
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:16,051
谁游泳？
Who's swimming?

1103
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:17,524
我游得很好的
l swim well

1104
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:18,651
走啊
Let's go

1105
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:19,659
不过人家没带泳衣
But l have no swim suit

1106
01:03:19,762 --> 01:03:20,524
我得陪人家
l have to accompany others

1107
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:22,895
借我过桥
You used me

1108
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:24,923
就这么一次，下不为例
This is an exception

1109
01:03:25,034 --> 01:03:25,591
去你的
Damn you

1110
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:27,057
一定要有泳衣才可以游泳的吗？
You do need a swim suit to swim

1111
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:29,502
我游给你看，走
l'll show you, let's go

1112
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:33,774
你不去游泳？
Aren't you swimming?

1113
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:36,504
天天关在屋子里对着麻将
l am facing mahjong all day in my room

1114
01:03:36,612 --> 01:03:38,910
现在看到蓝天像白板
The sky appears like a dragon tile

1115
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:41,244
绿水像发财
The sea reminds me of that too

1116
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:42,612
还敢去游泳吗？
Would l still dare to swim?

1117
01:03:44,587 --> 01:03:46,077
泼死你，泼死你
l'll make you wet

1118
01:03:46,189 --> 01:03:48,851
别泼，我投降...
Don't, l surrender

1119
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:51,153
这么坏，我看你敢不敢叫我裸泳？
Still dare to ask me to swim in the nude?

1120
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:53,455
不敢，不敢
No, no l dare not

1121
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:00,496
这样更好看呀
This looks even better

1122
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:23,320
救命啊...
Help

1123
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,892
救命啊...
Help !

1124
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:36,768
快进去，别出来
Hide and don't come out

1125
01:04:39,809 --> 01:04:41,538
救命啊...
Help

1126
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:46,480
救命啊...
Help

1127
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:53,782
救我...
Help me

1128
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:57,826
快点
Quickly

1129
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:29,214
买定离手
Place your bets

1130
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:31,349
开
Open

1131
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:32,222
慢着
Wait

1132
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:38,967
哇，这么多钱...
Wow, so much money...

1133
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:43,801
开吧
Go on, open

1134
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:47,132
这位老兄，请你等等好吗？
Can you wait please?

1135
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:48,608
为什么要等一下？
What for?

1136
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:52,504
怎么样？受不受啊？
Well, will you take the bet?

1137
01:05:53,249 --> 01:05:54,181
老兄，请等一下
Please wait

1138
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:55,841
我们公司是限注的
We have a limit on bets

1139
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:57,619
我以为你们这间公司很大
l thought you were a big company

1140
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,017
原来也是小儿科
Looks like it is a small business

1141
01:05:59,121 --> 01:05:59,815
等一等
Wait

1142
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:01,980
这铺例外，受你
l'll make an exception and take your bet

1143
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:05,085
这样才对
That's more like it

1144
01:06:05,194 --> 01:06:06,354
你们也不一定输
You might win

1145
01:06:08,064 --> 01:06:08,826
我来开
Let me open

1146
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:25,812
不要开
Don't

1147
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:29,045
现在不可以拿回钱了
You can't take back your bet now

1148
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:30,743
没有人说把钱拿回来
That's not my intention

1149
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:32,848
是你扒摊的方法不对
The way you count the chips is wrong

1150
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:36,725
有什么不对？
What's wrong?

1151
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,885
我金山那边是两粒两粒扒的
ln America we count in twos

1152
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:40,019
扒两粒？
ln twos?!

1153
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:41,853
为什么你要扒四粒呢？
Why count by fours?

1154
01:06:43,899 --> 01:06:45,423
两粒，两粒怎么扒？
How to count in twos?

1155
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:46,501
哪有这样的？
ls there such a thing?

1156
01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:51,535
这位先生有没有弄错？
Do you know what you are doing?

1157
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,938
我没弄错，扒两粒
Yes, count in twos

1158
01:06:58,381 --> 01:07:00,747
好，就照你的意思扒两粒
Alright, do it your way

1159
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:04,314
其他的朋友请把钱都拿回去
The others please take back your bets

1160
01:07:04,754 --> 01:07:06,381
这一铺就跟这位先生赌
This game is solely for
this gentleman here

1161
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:30,036
摊开二
Two

1162
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:35,911
如果扒四粒的话
lf it were counted by fours

1163
01:07:36,018 --> 01:07:36,746
你不就赢了
You wouldn't have won

1164
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:38,918
就是啊，怎么这么笨呢？
That's right, how dumb !

1165
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:40,648
你买三四，叫人两粒两粒扒
You place bets on 3 and 4,
and counting by twos

1166
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:42,917
你一定输的，笨蛋
You're bound to lose, idiot

1167
01:07:43,492 --> 01:07:45,653
输钱事小，我再买下一铺
Losing is no problem, l'll try again

1168
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:00,733
这铺是不是两粒两粒扒的？
Count by twos again?

1169
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:02,777
上一铺都是，这一铺当然一样
But of course, like the last game

1170
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:12,577
对不起
Sorry

1171
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:15,179
这一铺要照规矩扒四粒
This will follow the rules
and count by fours

1172
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:17,958
刚才一铺扒两粒
The last game counted by twos

1173
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:19,320
现在为什么扒四粒？
Why count by fours this time?

1174
01:08:22,064 --> 01:08:23,326
如果不扒两粒
lf you don't count by twos

1175
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:25,093
上一铺就不该受人家
You shouldn't have taken bets
for the last game

1176
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:29,160
是呀
Right

1177
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:30,236
各位不要吵
Hold your horses

1178
01:08:33,542 --> 01:08:36,033
如果郭先生不肯开这一铺的话
lf Mr Kwok would not play this game

1179
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:37,745
大家拿回钱走呀
Take back your money

1180
01:08:38,514 --> 01:08:41,677
我相信赌场不止这一间的
l am sure there are other gambling joints

1181
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:46,118
燕西楼，原来你们是串通好的
So you two are conspiring, Yin

1182
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:48,883
千万不要这么说
Don't put it that way

1183
01:08:49,391 --> 01:08:51,325
我不过来找点外快买惊风散
l just wanted some money
to calm my nerves

1184
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,728
你知道，我不是给人吓惯的
You know, l'm not used to threats

1185
01:08:54,597 --> 01:09:01,230
开呀
Open...

1186
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:05,369
好，这铺我照开
OK, l'll entertain this game

1187
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:08,534
好...
Good...

1188
01:09:09,278 --> 01:09:11,508
开什么开，赔钱吧
Here, cover the loss

1189
01:09:11,614 --> 01:09:12,672
等一下
Wait

1190
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:17,646
净买一个数怎么跟我算？
How do you pay if l bet on just one?

1191
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:23,255
开呀...
Open...

1192
01:09:30,132 --> 01:09:32,600
一
One!

1193
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:34,534
连本都输光了
All is lost

1194
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:37,838
燕西楼，你怎么知道我开一的？
Yin, how do you know l have a one?

1195
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:38,838
郭老兄
Old Kwok

1196
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:41,933
就算天下第一赌王也要碰碰运气的
Even the best sometimes depends on luck

1197
01:09:42,978 --> 01:09:44,946
赔钱，到此为止
Pay them, game over

1198
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:24,482
好眼光
Keen eyes

1199
01:10:24,954 --> 01:10:25,716
好镇定
Very cool

1200
01:10:30,526 --> 01:10:33,051
燕先生，我知道你是高手
Mr Yin, you're an expert

1201
01:10:33,662 --> 01:10:37,462
不过事不关己，己不劳心这句话
Mind your own business

1202
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:38,555
你该听过吧？
Have you heard the saying?

1203
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:40,427
这句话就没听过
No l haven't

1204
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,196
不过时常听人说
But l've heard

1205
01:10:42,304 --> 01:10:44,135
路见不平，拔刀相助
lnterfere when there is injustice

1206
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:52,205
那你是存心跟我们作对？
So you're bent on opposing us?

1207
01:10:53,115 --> 01:10:54,446
凡事要公平竞争
l want a fair fight

1208
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:56,708
你们又什么可以只手遮天
Why do you want to have absolute power

1209
01:10:56,819 --> 01:10:58,252
不给庄臣一个机会呢？
And don't give Johnson a chance?

1210
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:00,385
我是丘本立的太太
l am the wife of Yau

1211
01:11:00,489 --> 01:11:02,719
庄臣根本就没有资格跟我争
Johnson is not worthy to compete with me

1212
01:11:02,825 --> 01:11:03,723
丘老爷既然要你们
Since it is Yau's intention

1213
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:05,794
在麻将桌上决一高下
You should sort this out
at the mahjong table

1214
01:11:05,894 --> 01:11:07,623
那么庄臣就有资格跟你争
Then Johnson is worthy

1215
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:11,225
燕西楼，刚才我已经忍你很久了
Yin, l've been patient with you

1216
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:13,333
你现在你还不识相？
You still push your luck?

1217
01:11:13,969 --> 01:11:15,698
我向来是硬骨头
l've always been a tough guy

1218
01:11:15,804 --> 01:11:16,862
不懂什么叫识相
And pushed my luck

1219
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:28,346
这三个月来
ln these 3 months

1220
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,145
可以教你的我已经全都教了
l've taught you all l can

1221
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:33,252
下个礼拜你就跟你干妈决一胜负
Next week you'll compete with your aunt

1222
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:36,949
我想你该有个心理准备
You should be psychologically prepared

1223
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:40,061
牌打得好不一定能赢
Technique doesn't guarantee winning

1224
01:11:41,063 --> 01:11:43,190
还要讲运气，时机
There's luck, opportunity

1225
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:45,759
临场应变决定一切
And reaction during competition

1226
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:48,069
记住，骄兵必败
Remember, pride comes before a fall

1227
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:54,136
庄臣
Johnson

1228
01:11:54,243 --> 01:11:55,574
我今天约了刘先生跟黄先生
l've invited Mr Lau and Mr Wonh

1229
01:11:55,678 --> 01:11:56,702
两位千门高手
Two experts

1230
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:57,938
算是跟你考毕业试
To test you at the graduation exam

1231
01:11:58,414 --> 01:11:59,403
最要紧是镇定
Stay cool

1232
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:05,879
东
East

1233
01:12:07,222 --> 01:12:07,916
碰
Pung

1234
01:12:23,272 --> 01:12:24,034
南
South

1235
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:36,378
这章白板不能打
l can't discard the White Dragon

1236
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:38,149
四条
4 bamboos

1237
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:39,912
小刘呀
Liu

1238
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:42,380
白先生最近怎么没有来找我们？
Why hasn't Mr Pak visited us lately?

1239
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:44,323
怎么？你很想见他？
Why, you want to see him?

1240
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:48,196
白板
White Dragon

1241
01:12:48,297 --> 01:12:48,854
碰
Pung

1242
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:52,790
不好意思，大三元，对对胡
Sorry, All Dragon, All sets

1243
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:56,031
你胡什么我不知道
l don't know what is it that you want

1244
01:12:56,739 --> 01:12:57,763
总之我胡白板
But l want White Dragon

1245
01:12:58,974 --> 01:13:00,498
混一色平胡，四番
4 points

1246
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:05,979
庄臣的麻将真的有那么好？
ls Johnson really that good?

1247
01:13:07,483 --> 01:13:10,008
我这两位朋友绝不会看错
My two friends would not misjudge him

1248
01:13:11,754 --> 01:13:14,348
照我看，他都接近第一流
He's near to being the best

1249
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:15,184
是啊，真的
Really

1250
01:13:16,658 --> 01:13:17,454
那怎么办呢？
What should we do?

1251
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:22,621
不管他怎么出神入化，呼风唤雨
No matter how good he is

1252
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:25,599
我自有办法让那小子坐不上台子
l'll see to it
he doesn't come to the table

1253
01:13:27,269 --> 01:13:28,793
祝你今天旗开得胜
Good luck to you

1254
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:29,336
谢谢
Thanks

1255
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:48,053
师傅
Teacher

1256
01:13:49,525 --> 01:13:50,549
您也来了
You're here too !

1257
01:13:50,659 --> 01:13:53,492
是啊，你最好多赢一点
Yes, win more

1258
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:55,256
让师傅也开开心
So l'll be pleased

1259
01:13:55,564 --> 01:13:56,189
醒目点
Watch it

1260
01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:14,808
撞他
Ram him

1261
01:14:17,519 --> 01:14:19,009
他们想干什么？
What do they want?

1262
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:22,486
不用怕，玩两手给你看看
Don't be scared, l'll show them

1263
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:34,060
还想逃，撞
Want to escape? Ram him

1264
01:14:49,952 --> 01:14:51,579
快点...把他甩掉
Quickly, lest he escapes

1265
01:15:02,731 --> 01:15:03,698
别管那么多了
Never mind that

1266
01:15:03,799 --> 01:15:06,825
快点把车开出去，开回去
Go back, go back

1267
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:07,560
开出去？
Go back?

1268
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:09,296
你不怕又给郭柱那班人撞
Aren't you afraid of being crushed

1269
01:15:10,472 --> 01:15:11,962
你不是说你技术很好吗？
Didn't you say you have good skills?

1270
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:14,536
快点开出去...快点
Back on the road, quickly

1271
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:16,268
好，开出去
Ok, let's go

1272
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:26,916
放心吧，三两下手势就可以了
Don't worry, this will take care of it

1273
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:27,681
不用怕
Don't be afraid

1274
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:31,418
是不是？他们连跟都跟不上
See? They can't keep up

1275
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:36,158
小心点，货车...
Be careful, stop...

1276
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:38,798
好危险呀
Very dangerous !

1277
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:42,498
怎么搞的？死家伙
What? The damned fellow

1278
01:15:42,604 --> 01:15:44,299
你会不会开车？退后
Do you know how to drive? Move backward

1279
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:54,639
好呀，甩掉他们了
Good, we've lost them

1280
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:34,215
这是什么地方呀？
What's this place?

1281
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:37,551
大概是天堂边缘
Edge of heaven, l guess

1282
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:40,694
完了
We've finished

1283
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:43,787
这次他跑不了吧，撞他下去
He can't escape now, ram him

1284
01:16:56,411 --> 01:16:57,673
没事了，解决了
lts alright now

1285
01:16:57,779 --> 01:16:59,440
我们回去收钱了，走...
Let's go and collect our money

1286
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:32,238
本立，他根本就没有胆子来
He doesn't have the guts to show up

1287
01:17:33,548 --> 01:17:34,947
不要耽误大家的时间
Let's not waste everybody's time

1288
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:35,880
当他弃权算了
Assume he has given up

1289
01:17:43,592 --> 01:17:44,581
来了，来了
He's coming, he's coming

1290
01:17:44,693 --> 01:17:45,625
丘少爷来了
Master Yau is here

1291
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:57,731
各位雀林前辈，娱乐界友好

1319
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:38,028
看起来，南北都让人扣死了
Looks like l am cornered

1320
01:20:38,533 --> 01:20:40,330
这次只有斧底抽薪了

She just played north,
and hasn't taken a tile

1326
01:21:14,402 --> 01:21:15,391

这招真高，媚姨真有两下子
Aunt May has good skills

1334
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:48,102
是啊，没两下子怎么敢上台打呢？
Of course,
how can she compete otherwise !

1335
01:21:55,543 --> 01:21:59,309
燕先生，真不好意思

现在打完了吗？

1338
01:22:06,821 --> 01:22:10,757
牌是没打完，不过不够班

lt'd be best to discard this

1357

红中
Red Dragon

1358
01:23:19,127 --> 01:23:20,719
就算她一手都是筒子
Even all the tiles are Circles

1359
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:21,887
最多听八番
She can get 8 points the most

1360
01:23:26,568 --> 01:23:27,398
红中
Red Dragon

1361
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:29,997
这小子搞什么鬼？
What is this kid doing?

1362
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:37,207
现在想都不用想了，九子连环

01:23:44,586 --> 01:23:46,781
见鬼了，听八章摸第九章
Hell, draw the unwanted one

1365
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:50,282
不要那章来那章

1366
01:23:51,626 --> 01:23:52,354

碰
Pung

1368
01:23:55,330 --> 01:23:57,298
听八章都胡不过你，真是见鬼
lt's bad luck losing to you
with such good chances

1369
01:24:00,402 --> 01:24:02,495
听八章的出冲给听九章的胡
The possibility of you losing to me is...

1370
01:24:02,604 --> 01:24:06,040
百分率是0.000134857
0.000134857

1371
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:07,701

01:24:37,605 --> 01:24:39,971
西也没出，他们两个一定对死
Looks like they're cornered

1378
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:41,232
大家都难胡了
No one will win

1379
01:24:41,776 --> 01:24:43,243
现在就只剩七章牌
Only 7 tiles left for drawing

1380
01:24:43,344 --> 01:24:44,572
如果我开杠就二对一
lf l Kong than Johnson...

1381
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:46,010
不开杠就二对二

1382
01:24:59,194 --> 01:24:59,956
二万

老不死的
You old fool

1384
01:25:10,004 --> 01:25:11,301
早不开，晚不开
Doing it at the wrong time

1385
01:25:11,406 --> 01:25:12,668
本来我海底捞月的
l can draw the last tile

1386
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:13,672
现在没有牌摸了
Now there are no more tiles

1387
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:14,935
还摸一章这样的牌回来
And to get this tile

1388
01:25:26,421 --> 01:25:27,445
全部生章
This one not discarded before

1389
01:25:27,889 --> 01:25:28,947
打发财，红中
lf l discard Green or Red Dragon

1390
01:25:29,057 --> 01:25:31,855
输给那小子对碰的机会多两倍

of losing to the kid

1391
01:25:32,093 --> 01:25:32,718
打白板

1392
01:25:32,827 --> 01:25:34,761
最多输给两家绝章单吊

1393
01:25:35,663 --> 01:25:36,322
白板
White Dragon

1394
01:25:37,999 --> 01:25:40,331
媚姨，的确很难打
Aunt May, it is difficult indeed

1395
01:25:40,435 --> 01:25:41,459
真是难为你了
lt's really hard on you !

1396
01:25:49,344 --> 01:25:51,904
庄臣，以后好好管理我那些生意了
Johnson,
take care of my business hereafter

1397
01:25:58,153 --> 01:25:58,812
不太对
Something's wrong

1398
01:26:10,198 --> 01:26:11,324
你干爹对你不错
Your Godpa treats you well

1399
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:27,915
庄臣...
Johnson...

1400
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:31,011
我终于赶来看你了
We have at last arrived

1401
01:26:32,086 --> 01:26:34,748
师傅，师傅
Teacher, teacher

1402
01:26:36,157 --> 01:26:37,920
我赢了，师傅
l've won, teacher !

1403
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:39,493
那就好了
That's great

1404
01:26:40,695 --> 01:26:42,356
抗议，我抗议
l protest

1405
01:26:42,463 --> 01:26:44,226
丘本立很明显帮他干儿子
lt is obvious Yau is helping him

1406
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:45,495
这是个骗局
This is a set up

1407
01:26:46,601 --> 01:26:48,125
你们看，丘本立出千
Yau is cheating, look

1408
01:26:48,236 --> 01:26:49,203
你们大家主持公道
You be the judge

1409
01:26:51,072 --> 01:26:52,562
难道我不要胡也算出千吗？
Does this count for cheating?

1410
01:26:52,974 --> 01:26:54,168
你不照规矩打就是出千
Not playing by the rules is cheating

1411
01:26:54,776 --> 01:26:55,504
你暗杠一条
You hid Kong 1 bamboo

1412
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:56,702
里面三章全是发财
But the three tiles are Green Dragon

1413
01:26:57,579 --> 01:26:59,069
看不出你德高望重
Under your dignified appearance

1414
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:00,545
居然使出这种卑鄙手段
You use such lowly tricks

1415
01:27:00,815 --> 01:27:02,578
你淫妻女，意图夺产
You commit adultery
& want to grab other's property

1416
01:27:02,684 --> 01:27:03,582
那又算什么？
How about that?

1417
01:27:16,497 --> 01:27:17,327
一笔归一笔
The two issues are separate

1418
01:27:17,932 --> 01:27:18,899
不要混在一起讲
Let's not confuse them

1419
01:27:19,968 --> 01:27:22,994
问题是你怎么向雀林高手交待？
The point is how can you account
to all experts

1420
01:27:23,671 --> 01:27:24,831
这些是家事
This is a family affair

1421
01:27:24,939 --> 01:27:26,429
我不需要向任何人交待
l don't need to be answerable to anyone

1422
01:27:30,945 --> 01:27:34,381
不过，我现在向各位礼貌的说一声
However l will say politely to all

1423
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:37,910
庄臣就是我所有产业的继承人
Johnson is my sole heir

1424
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:46,420
既然你替他出头
Since you stand up for him

1425
01:27:46,527 --> 01:27:47,619
有种就再打一铺
See if you have the guts
to play once more

1426
01:27:47,895 --> 01:27:48,589
郭老兄
Brother Kwok

1427
01:27:48,696 --> 01:27:49,958
你觉得输得不服气吗？
You don't admit defeat, do you?

1428
01:27:51,232 --> 01:27:53,132
为了使你心服口服
To convince you

1429
01:27:53,234 --> 01:27:54,462
我破例跟你玩一铺
l'll exceptionally play with you

1430
01:27:54,702 --> 01:27:57,398
好，不过要讲代价
OK, for a price

1431
01:27:58,473 --> 01:27:59,531
太大我玩不起的
l can't afford too high a stake

1432
01:28:01,042 --> 01:28:02,839
如果我输给你燕西楼
