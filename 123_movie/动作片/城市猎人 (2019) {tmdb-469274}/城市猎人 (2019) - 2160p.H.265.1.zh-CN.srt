1
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,339
Oh, Kim Na Na...
It's a good thing you're here.

2
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,119
No matter how I make my coffee,
I can't make it the way you do.

3
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,669
Can you make me a cup of coffee?

4
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,819
Lee Yoon Sung.

5
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,949
Oh, our contract ended.

6
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,849
Then just tell me how you make it.

7
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,150
Lee Yoon Sung.

8
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,019
Who gave you permission to keep meddling
in my life whenever you want?

9
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,400
Who do you think you are to buy my house?

10
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,849
Do you feel sorry for me?
Am I that pitiful?

11
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,319
Can you say it so I understand
what you're talking about?

12
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,349
My house...
I heard you bought it.

13
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,550
And you had the title
transferred to your name quickly, too.

14
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,974
Did you really want to show off
how wealthy you are to a girl...

15
00:01:19,975 --> 00:01:22,759
who lives in constant fear of being evicted?

16
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:27,149
How pitiful must I have looked, what with
all my odd jobs, scraping by through life...

17
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,490
Kim Na Na.

18
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,799
Isn't it my right to choose whether or not
to buy a house with my own money?

19
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,229
Why do I have to be questioned by you?

20
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,939
You have your own house
and a very nice one at that!

21
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,089
Money shouldn't be left idle.
It should always be rolling.

22
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,279
That's my father's theory.

23
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,579
Your house is really old and rundown.

24
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:50,219
But you're the person who first told me
that the house was going into auction.

25
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,349
When I saw it,
I realized it's close to the Blue House

26
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,249
and I'll make a huge profit
on my investment, if it's ever rebuilt.

27
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,219
Why do I have to give that up?

28
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,938
Then you're really going to live
in that house?

29
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:01,639
Yes.

30
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,009
You're going to leave that nice house...

31
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,809
to live in a house in a horrible
neighborhood, that's about to collapse,

32
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,359
where you have to use washing bins
to catch leaks whenever it rains?

33
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,550
Yeah.

34
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,859
You will purposely leave your house
to suffer in that old house?

35
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,279
Does that make sense?!

36
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,690
How many times do I have to tell you?

37
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,989
I was going to ask you
to vacate the place soon anyway.

38
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,090
When do you plan to move out?

39
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,619
Kim Na Na, be a little more honest.

40
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,910
Didn't you come to beg me to let you
keep living there a little longer?

41
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,759
Then plead your case nicely,

42
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,369
And maybe I’ll change my mind.

43
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,380
It's not fun if you get all
argumentative.

44
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,629
Lee Yoon Sung, you're the one
who seems to have misunderstood.

45
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,919
It seems you bought that house
to reign over me,

46
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,129
but that will never happen.

47
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,819
Because to me,
people who play with love through money...

48
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,139
are jerks to the bone.

49
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,710
I'll move out of there
so meet me after work.

50
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,680
What?

51
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,569
Humans are the type of beings
who make mistakes as they live, right?

52
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:37,130
Just get to the point.

53
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:42,529
I heard you brought me home last night
and I didn't get to say thank you.

54
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,040
All right, I've accepted your thanks,
so what's your point?

55
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:51,269
I didn't make any mistakes last night,
right?

56
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,660
I blacked out so...

57
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,309
You don't remember anything?

58
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,440
Nothing?

59
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,250
Nope, except one thing...

60
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,360
I think there was a girl next to you
last night.

61
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,989
Oh, you remember that?

62
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:17,519
It's not Shin Eun Ah by any chance, right?

63
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,810
Shin Eun Ah?

64
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,869
Oh, nothing!

65
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,070
That's what you wanted to verify?

66
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:28,939
Let's just get to work.

67
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,199
- Hold on.
- What again?

68
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,639
I really didn't make any mistakes, right?

69
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,400
Yeah, you did!
A lot of them, too!

70
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,470
Man, what do I do?

71
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,360
<i>Agent Kim Na Na.</i>

72
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,800
Agent Kim Na Na.

73
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,049
We have to guard candidate Seo Yong Hak.

74
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,509
If we don't leave now,
we'll be late for our shift.

75
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,660
Then let's go.

76
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:27,320
You keep sighing.
Did something happen?

77
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,050
No, nothing happened.

78
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,739
<i>That's the person.</i>

79
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,409
He put a gun to my head...

80
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,590
and said that if I want to live,
I must get off the bus instantly.

81
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,799
Both Lee Kyung Wan and Seo Yong Hak...

82
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,259
were both shot at and kidnapped
at the same time.

83
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,370
Could these be schemes
plotted by a terrorist group?

84
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,429
North Korea?

85
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,599
I heard these two
have been friends for decades.

86
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,859
Then could it be that person,
the City Hunter?

87
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,389
I don't think so.

88
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,789
To deliver the man to the Prosecutor's
Office, then try to kill him after?

89
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,979
That makes no sense.

90
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,109
That's true.

91
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,129
You had the letter on the Seo Yong Hak case
examined for fingerprints, right?

92
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,709
Yes, but I was told it might take a while
because it contained multiple fingerprints.

93
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,519
Run a comparison
of the fingerprints from the elevator

94
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,569
to the ones from the truck
to the fingerprints from the letters.

95
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,239
Seeing as how these two cases occurred
at such close time periods,

96
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,329
they could both be plotted
by one person or organization.

97
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:24,139
There were two suspicious people
at the building.

98
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:29,130
One was either injured or walks funny...

99
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,669
Prosecutor.

100
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,109
That man's movement was a little strange.

101
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,519
His movement?

102
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,059
I thought it was because we were on
a moving vehicle,

103
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,849
but now that I think about it,
how should I explain this?

104
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:43,740
One of his legs seemed to have a problem.

105
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,988
Investigator Jang, find all Korean residents
between the ages of 40 and 60

106
00:06:48,989 --> 00:06:50,689
who are handicapped with one leg.

107
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,720
Yes.

108
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:52,789
Investigator Kim.

109
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,329
You said the sniper's gun
was an American made AR -15, right?

110
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,919
Yes, that was the result
of the bullet forensics analysis.

111
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,669
Find out if there is a handicapped person
who came from abroad within the last year,

112
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,389
with more attention towards the US.

113
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:05,599
Prosecutor,
there are probably a lot of them...

114
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,570
We need to find him
even if we have to work all night!

115
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,320
If ever needed,
this place would be a good place to hide.

116
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,679
Wow. What the heck...

117
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,789
So you want me to cover all the windows
and doors with iron bars?

118
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,069
On a house that may be reconstructed
any day now?

119
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,830
Yes.

120
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,979
Why don't you just make do for now?
It's such a waste of money.

121
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,999
Will you do it or not?
I can give you the money now if you want.

122
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,899
Give me a 50 percent deposit now
and pay me the rest once it's done.

123
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,879
Then please install it now.

124
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,739
Don't worry about the price and use only
the strongest and most reliable materials.

125
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,729
This guy...
Don't you see I'm busy?

126
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,879
I'll have it done tomorrow morning.

127
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,000
Tomorrow morning?

128
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,629
I have to go to work...

129
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,439
You can just leave the keys.

130
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,589
I won't touch anything in the house.

131
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,810
The keys?

132
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,179
Kim Na Na, just live in that house
until I tell you to leave.

133
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,330
I'll just let you stay
since you have nowhere to go.

134
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,020
No, not like that...

135
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,860
Kim Na Na.

136
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:14,210
I'm sorry about before.

137
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:20,489
I just bought the place as an investment,
so stay as long as you need.

138
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,980
Okay?

139
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,320
Oh, my God.

140
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,319
I said right after work
and you're right on time.

141
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,999
Are you really that desperate
for this house?

142
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,129
If I wasn't, why would I buy it?

143
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,215
Give me the keys.

144
00:09:36,216 --> 00:09:39,174
You came to get the keys.

145
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:43,239
Not a penny you've spent goes to waste,
so you'll become wealthy in no time.

146
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,520
Follow me.

147
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,029
I'll pack everything then give you the keys.

148
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,599
No, just give me the keys first.

149
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,699
I will...
I will, okay?

150
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,500
I won't insist on living here
and not give you the keys, okay?

151
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,010
Hey!

152
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,890
Hey, Kim Na Na!

153
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,960
Flower Pretty Boy?

154
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,610
Is she giving this to me?

155
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,249
Why do you touch other people's things
without their permission?

156
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,789
Do I need permission
to touch this little thing?

157
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,650
It's not just a little thing, okay?

158
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,399
A first impression is always right.

159
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,999
I knew the moment I drove your car while you
had a great time with a girl in the back.

160
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,029
Hey, Kim Na Na.

161
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:02,369
I thought I judged you unfairly, seeing you
helped me with my father's hospital fees...

162
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,720
and how you were with Mi Jin and Do Jin.
But...

163
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,409
Just put your stuff back.

164
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,469
If you need this house, just stay.

165
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,209
Are you joking?

166
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:16,039
I don't know if you're playing around
because you're wealthy

167
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,789
or if you really bought this
as an investment,

168
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:23,319
- but since I was seven, this house...
- I know.

169
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,990
It's a house with a table your dad built
and a tablecloth your mom made.

170
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,850
So I'm telling you to stay here!

171
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,800
Here.

172
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,559
Just feed her once a day.

173
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,190
Ddorong is smart. She'll do her business
in the bathroom if you keep the door open.

174
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,019
When I find a place, I'll get
the rest of my things and pick up Ddorong.

175
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,709
You're asking me to live with this dog?
Says who?!

176
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,519
Can't you do at least that much since you're
forcing me to move out with a day's notice?!

177
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,520
It's my choice whether I'll do it for you
or not! I'm the house owner.

178
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,039
Ddorong, even if this ahjussi annoys you,
just put up with it for now.

179
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,720
I'll be back to pick you up soon.

180
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:11,690
Here are the keys that you wanted so badly.

181
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,980
Hey, Kim...

182
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,870
Kim Na Na.

183
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,889
Did I tell her to leave?

184
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,689
Did I ever brag about being rich?

185
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,889
She's the one who started everything
and got angry about me buying this place.

186
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,191
She lost her temper first!

187
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,659
<i>Carefully,</i>

188
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,950
What am I going to do about her?

189
00:12:32,964 --> 00:12:36,920
<i>I want to tell you,</i>

190
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:40,597
<i>Oh, I'm your lovely girl,</i>

191
00:12:40,598 --> 00:12:46,233
<i>While in your embrace</i>

192
00:12:46,234 --> 00:12:49,980
<i>Hello, hello, you shiny boy</i>

193
00:12:49,981 --> 00:12:57,310
<i>Cupid's arrow
shot straight through my heart</i>

194
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,980
Hey, Kim Na Na!

195
00:13:01,222 --> 00:13:05,101
<i>Hello, hello, you shiny boy</i>

196
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,490
Kim Na Na, wait!

197
00:13:08,553 --> 00:13:12,487
<i>Your sweet laughter sneaked into my heart.</i>

198
00:13:12,488 --> 00:13:16,245
<i>I'm nervous all day.</i>

199
00:13:16,246 --> 00:13:18,087
<i>You got my heart</i>

200
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:21,871
<i>My love, my love, my love, my boy...</i>

201
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,170
Hey, Kim Na Na!

202
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,389
Stop the bus!

203
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,110
Come out!

204
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,110
Hey!

205
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,520
Wait a minute!

206
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,840
Oh... She...

207
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,649
Dad, why are you so skinny?

208
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,960
Are you upset that I don't visit often?

209
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:12,550
I've been busy lately.
I was guarding and I almost got shot.

210
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm not that bad, huh?

211
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:21,930
I'm sorry, Dad.

212
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:28,840
The director says I'm insubordinate
and I don't have the skills to be a guard.

213
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,960
My salary was cut,

214
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:38,540
and the house was bought by another person.

215
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,920
Dad, what do I do?

216
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:53,100
My life is a joke right now.

217
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:56,930
I don't even have a place to sleep.

218
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,210
I survived because of this person...

219
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,620
Because I felt like dying...

220
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,970
It's funny, huh?

221
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:58,390
<i>Yeah, I'm at Dad's hospital.</i>

222
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:04,369
I don't know.
It's okay.

223
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:09,160
Excuse me for a moment.

224
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,840
I'll call you back.

225
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,920
What is it?

226
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:25,489
This may seem a bit sudden,
but do you see the guy in the back?

227
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,819
He really likes you.

228
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,079
No, don't look now.

229
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,959
He's good looking.

230
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,969
You won't regret it.

231
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:40,890
Get a cup of coffee with him
or just coolly reject him.

232
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,040
Hello.

233
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:56,839
What is it?

234
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,080
I heard from your friend,

235
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,870
but I'm sorry, you're not my type.

236
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,280
Excuse me.

237
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:11,269
Can you give me your friend's number?

238
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,729
He's my type.

239
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,770
What?

240
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,160
What the...?

241
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,559
Hey, you have to be bark
when someone comes in.

242
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,840
How can I entrust Na Na to you
if you're like this?!

243
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,880
What's going on?

244
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,750
What's wrong with this?

245
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:41,150
What decade is this?

246
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:47,070
Nothing works here.

247
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,679
Kim Na Na,
why don't you ever let me finish talking?

248
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,826
Why are you so stubborn?

249
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,190
Making people feel sorry...

250
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,320
What the heck?

251
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:40,454
Ah! Kim Na Na...

252
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,399
Hey! How could you leave the house
in that shape?!

253
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,540
Nothing works!

254
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,469
Raise the house to your standards
or adjust your standards to the house.

255
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,599
Why won't the toilet flush?

256
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,989
Do you have to stick your hand in
every time?

257
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,139
The shower head always falls off.

258
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,372
I turned on cold water for a shower,

259
00:20:12,407 --> 00:20:14,608
but it spewed out water
hot enough to boil me alive.

260
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:18,380
What do you expect from a building
that has almost been torn down 3 times?!

261
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,089
Don't make me angry so early in the morning.

262
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:24,740
Let's just pretend we didn't see each other.

263
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,989
Dr. Lee! Good morning!

264
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:33,099
Wow Dr. Lee,
you're so amazing with this service!

265
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,330
Sorry,
but this coffee belongs to someone else.

266
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,639
Lee Kyung Wan was kidnapped
and Seo Yong Hak was almost shot.

267
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:51,599
Anonymous letters, hacking,
and a City Hunter on top of that...

268
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,499
Please eat breakfast and then work.
We all need to eat to live!

269
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,419
I bet Seo Yong Hak and even the
City Hunter are eating breakfast right now.

270
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,819
The results from the letter fingerprints
aren't out yet, right?

271
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,499
If the results don't come out soon,
the evidence won't be valid anymore.

272
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,779
Please calm down.

273
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:10,670
Every time we call the forensics center,
they yell at us that we're rushing too much.

274
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,750
Excuse me.

275
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,939
We found the person who crashed
the servers in the Blue House yesterday.

276
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,755
- You did?
- You...

277
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,879
You mean the one who put up a huge picture
of a military boot riddled with nails?

278
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,639
and crashed all the servers?

279
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,269
But it was a Blue House employee.

280
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,379
From the National Communications Network
Team Office of the Security Service.

281
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,289
That's where experts work.

282
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,039
But the work wasn't that of an expert.

283
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,639
Overloading to hack the system
is an outdated method.

284
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,559
Lee Kyung Wan and that letter writer too...!

285
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,980
- Investigator Kim, please get a warrant.
- Yes, Sir.

286
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:40,179
Lee Kyung Wan's case, Seo Yong Hak's case,
the military boots and the letters...

287
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,020
They are all related somehow.

288
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,669
I'm Prosecutor Kim Yong Joo
from the Seoul Prosecutor's Office.

289
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,180
Where is Go Ki Joon?

290
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,859
Over there...

291
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,769
What is the problem?

292
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:57,860
I'm sorry to barge in at this time.

293
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,019
Go Ki Joon.

294
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,899
I'm sure you know why we're here.

295
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:05,979
You'll have to come with us for breaching
Section 72 of the Securities Exchange Law,

296
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,259
in committing a hack
into the information securities network.

297
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,679
What do you mean he has to go with you?

298
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,700
Investigator Jang.

299
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,940
Let's go.

300
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:13,870
Huh?

301
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,960
Get up.

302
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,369
Sorry for interrupting.

303
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:23,939
Wait...
Can you please explain?

304
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,499
The hacking case from yesterday
was traced to Go Ki Joon's house.

305
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,809
The IP address was verified to his house

306
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:31,739
and the prosecution has opened the case
for further investigation.

307
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,619
The hacking did not cause any harm...

308
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,359
and the servers were down
for merely two minutes.

309
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,869
It's not only for the hacking.

310
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:39,869
The anonymous letters, the recent shooting,

311
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:42,679
and the kidnapping seem to be connected,

312
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,690
which is why we obtained
a high priority arrest warrant.

313
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,590
Letters? Shooting? Hacking?!

314
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,180
Na Na.

315
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:12,479
Your face is healing well.

316
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,929
Thanks to you.

317
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,819
It seems we'll be
running into each other quite often.

318
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,540
Excuse me?

319
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,489
I've been put in charge
of investigating Seo Yong Hak's case...

320
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,129
and I heard
you're responsible for guarding him.

321
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:21,840
Yes.

322
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:25,030
Please help me out.

323
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,220
Yes. But wait!
What happened with Go Ki Joon?

324
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:38,729
I thought Go Ki Joon was odd
the very first time I met him.

325
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:44,249
He cried while we were sparring
and I thought he was a bit different,

326
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,639
but how could a Blue House employee
hack the Blue House?

327
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,039
Is he a spy like the rumors say?

328
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,659
A spy that the CIA planted?

329
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,059
Does that sound plausible to you?

330
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,699
He's tall but everyone in the Blue House
knows he and Lee Yoon Sung are wimps.

331
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,590
What?

332
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,289
The movies always show it like that!

333
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:01,820
Disguise.

334
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:05,459
Maybe that's just part of his disguise to
mislead everyone.

335
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,369
Shooting, letters, hacking!
Those are all big deals!

336
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:11,289
Thanks to him
there will be more trouble for us.

337
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:13,449
Now we have to all show our IDs
when we come to work.

338
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:16,069
Don't even start.
Even the trunk of my car was searched.

339
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:19,110
We're even restricted to surfing only within
the communications network.

340
00:24:19,111 --> 00:24:20,411
There are now
3 levels of firewall security too.

341
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:23,519
Why do we all have to suffer
because of one person's mistake?

342
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,090
They should investigate into
a person's background more meticulously.

343
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:30,919
You shouldn't talk like this!

344
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,429
What are you doing, agent Shin Eun Ah?

345
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,239
What's wrong?

346
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,499
Talking about someone behind his back
is not a polite thing to do.

347
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,899
Even though Go Ki Joon didn't graduate
from a prestigious university,

348
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,979
and he's very clumsy, a little dull
and not very likeable,

349
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:49,669
but he's not a bad person.

350
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:52,579
I can attest to that
as his drill instructor.

351
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,939
I find your actions to be wrong,

352
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,659
when you do not know
all the details of the situation.

353
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,559
I'll be going.

354
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,779
Agent Kim Na Na, let's go.

355
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,710
But I didn't finish eating...

356
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:18,249
So Seo Yong Hak's youngest son
was on the basketball team,

357
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,979
ruptured his ligament
and had surgery done on it.

358
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,370
And now he's in the midst of re-applying
for exemption from the military.

359
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:27,939
What's wrong with that?

360
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,299
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say,
Sir. It's pretty interesting.

361
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,224
This boy...

362
00:25:32,225 --> 00:25:35,509
went to a growth clinic until high school
senior year and they did a lot of imaging.

363
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,499
Senior year of high school?

364
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,869
I guess his treatment at the clinic worked,
he was able to join the basketball team.

365
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,390
No, no.

366
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,819
He's only about this tall.

367
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:46,349
It even makes you wonder
how he made it into the basketball team.

368
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,049
It's possible because it's just a club.

369
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,040
So?

370
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:52,879
But after only a month in college,

371
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,409
he received an exemption from the military
for his ruptured ligament.

372
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,949
We're not doctors, how are we supposed
to decipher these images?

373
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,280
Wait...

374
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,929
Did you find something?

375
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:08,210
The shape of the leg is different
even though the pictures are similar.

376
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,679
You're saying the shape of his leg changed
that much in a span of a couple of months?

377
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,829
Of course not.

378
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,359
The patients were switched.

379
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,579
He brought these images
of a ruptured ligament to the exam,

380
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,919
and had surgery on a perfectly healthy leg
to get to where he is now.

381
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,769
In other words...

382
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,739
Unquestionable military service corruption.

383
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,070
Bingo.

384
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,079
The former Minister of National Defense
has nothing better to do...

385
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,100
than come up with ploys to get his sons out
of military service?!

386
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,060
You see?

387
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:37,109
We should have just
taken cared of him that time.

388
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:41,760
Now that we know everything,
I won't let him get away.

389
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,450
Father, leave everything to me.

390
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,079
Nice to meet you.

391
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,510
Yes. It's nice to meet you.

392
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:58,620
Hello! It's nice to meet you!

393
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,599
Is your business running okay?

394
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,929
We're getting by.

395
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,540
That's good.

396
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,119
Sir! Sir!

397
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,980
Move!

398
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:09,939
Sir!

399
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,319
What are you?!
Get out of my way!

400
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,269
Sir!

401
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:16,740
I told you I have something to say!
Move!

402
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,779
Oh, my back!

403
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,899
This security guard is out to kill!

404
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,489
What are you doing?!

405
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:33,139
We asked you to guard us,
not show off your Judo skills!

406
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:36,659
Are you going to take responsibility
if people accuse us of being overprotected?

407
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,449
I'm sorry, I'll be more cautious.

408
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,889
I'm so sorry.

409
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:41,909
The shooting incident
occurred pretty recently...

410
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,429
so all the guards
are still nervous from that.

411
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:50,019
I will apologize on their behalf.
Sorry. I'm sorry.

412
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,204
I'm sorry.
He came in such a rush so...

413
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:55,001
Ah, yes...

414
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,639
What are you doing?
Hurry, accompany this man to the hospital!

415
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,639
Oh, my back!

416
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,369
Are you all right?

417
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,790
- Ow... I feel like I'm going to die.
- Are you okay? Let's get you up.

418
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,819
You can't tell from first glance.

419
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:12,510
Please work on
honing your natural instincts.

420
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,979
If the reporters find out,
they won’t write anything good.

421
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,509
What kind of security agent
throws a citizen around in the marketplace?

422
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:53,349
At a time when every vote is vital.
Goodness.

423
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,429
Even the shooting incident...

424
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:58,060
Was also the result of the
security agents' negligence.

425
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,659
Ma'am, I'm so sorry for today.

426
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:05,389
We're doing are hardest to
ensure your safety.

427
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:08,859
Of course...
That's why you're hired.

428
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:13,149
Please be cautious so that there is no
unnecessary gossip before the election.

429
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,760
Yes, Ma'am.

430
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,840
<i>Come clean the dog poo.</i>

431
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:37,389
What's going on?

432
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:40,320
This...
Clean it up.

433
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:44,349
I asked you to look after the dog.

434
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:47,679
You said all I need to do is feed her,
you didn't ask me to pick up her poop.

435
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,399
Taking care of her includes that!

436
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,289
Did you think you could only feed her?!

437
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,129
Then leave me a dog that doesn't poop!

438
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:57,800
Oh, my God...
I just won't say anything.

439
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,689
You said it's smart.

440
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:03,089
How could such a smart dog
poop on the floor like this?

441
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:05,969
I think the dog has trouble holding it in*,
just like its owner. (*short-tempered)

442
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,749
You didn't leave the bathroom door open,
did you?

443
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,879
My Ddorong is smart!

444
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,759
As long as you leave the door open,
she'll do her business in there.

445
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,160
Did you tell me that?

446
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,189
Why are you looking at me like that?

447
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:21,629
I won't ever clean up dog poo
so come and clean it up yourself every day.

448
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,930
Or take her with you.

449
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:27,529
You know I have nowhere else to go,
aren't you being too much?

450
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:30,390
Then just live with me!

451
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,519
Stop joking around!

452
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,619
Who said I'm joking?

453
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,929
If that wasn't a joke,

454
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,779
are you really expecting me
to live together with you?

455
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,139
You're playing with me again, aren't you?!

456
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,079
Hey, the ventilator is broken,
the toilet seat is broken too,

457
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,739
and the shower head falls off
if you breathe on it.

458
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:50,789
And how can there be not a single channel
on TV? You take responsibility.

459
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,689
What should I take responsibility?

460
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:55,049
I only bought the house
because I believed it could be redeveloped,

461
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,699
but I realized my investment
was a bad choice.

462
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,109
It's all right if you don't pay rent,

463
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,059
but you have to come over everyday
to cook and clean.

464
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,939
Also, the toilet seat, faucet,
the shower, and the TV,

465
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,739
fix all of them for me.

466
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,689
Also, when you have the money,

467
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:09,139
according to the auction price I paid,
you can buy it back.

468
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,740
That's what I mean by taking responsibility.

469
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,989
For you, those conditions are quite good.

470
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,329
Do you refuse?

471
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:18,749
It's not that...

472
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:21,319
But living under a single roof with a guy...

473
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,889
Ah... a guy and a girl?

474
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:25,319
Kim Na Na, you're good at judo, right?

475
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,779
You're a 4th Level?

476
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,779
Then, even if I have wayward thoughts
about you,

477
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,529
then I know clearly what you'll do to me,
would I still want to touch you?

478
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:32,379
Am I stupid?

479
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:35,239
I clearly know this,
would I go looking for a beating?

480
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,719
It seems that way.

481
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,550
Also, the ultimate deciding factor-
You...

482
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,449
are a B cup, right?

483
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:45,509
Anything smaller than a C cup,
I don't view as a woman.

484
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:49,139
Plus, Kim Na Na, don't you dislike me?

485
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,069
Then you won't secretly attack me.

486
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:55,110
What other problems can there be, right?

487
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:59,169
It seems you're still quite reluctant.

488
00:31:59,170 --> 00:31:59,989
Then, forget it.

489
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,440
Hold on!

490
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,199
Give me some time to think about it.

491
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,180
All right.

492
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:22,569
Everything he said is true.

493
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:25,579
I don't like him
and he doesn't like me either.

494
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:28,720
So nothing like that would happen.

495
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,170
I don't have a place to go.

496
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,109
I don't have to pay rent either.

497
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:40,600
He just wants me to cook a little more
and do household chores.

498
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:51,999
Mom, Dad, till I get this house back,

499
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,909
just till I get this house back,

500
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:56,440
please close your eyes.

501
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,259
If you don't want to, don't do it.

502
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,479
I won't have any regrets.

503
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,520
All right, let's live together.

504
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,899
But, I have conditions.

505
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,789
Conditions?

506
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:24,369
You have to sign a contract that says
there will never be any physical contact.

507
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,409
Hey, how many times
do you want me to say it?

508
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:28,079
You're not my type at all.

509
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,239
You would never ever,
ever be the type that I'd fall for.

510
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,509
I'm just taking precautions.

511
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:37,260
If, you grab my hand,

512
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,570
50,000 won!

513
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,739
You've gone crazy thinking about money.

514
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:45,869
Don't worry, if I grab your hand,
I'll give you 50,000 won too.

515
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:49,690
Then, what if I were to grab your shoulder?

516
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,639
100,000 won.

517
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,729
How about
if I put an arm around your shoulder?

518
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:55,249
200,000 won?

519
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:58,499
Then, what if I were to hug you?

520
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,619
300,000 won.

521
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,950

500,000 won!

523
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:09,520
Then, what about a kiss?

524
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,429
1 million won!

525
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:18,020
1... million... won?

526
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,019
Why are you acting like this,
all of a sudden?

527

Go over there.

528
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,499
Wow, it takes a lot of money
to be in a relationship with you.

529
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,369
What are you saying?

530
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,859
It's a million won for a kiss,

531
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,189
which guy would want to date you?

532
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:35,409
No one would be able to afford it,
even if it were a buy one get one free deal.

533
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:36,270
No...

534
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,679
If one were to prolong the kiss,
then it might be worth it.

536
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:41,899
Since you've already decided,

537
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,049
then you should go get your stuff.

Ah, my bag...

Hey, if you keep this up and Boss finds
out, I'll be dead too.

542
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,559
Even so, I feel like Na Na is in danger,

543
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,059
I have to stay by her side.

544
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,250
Na Na?

545
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,739
What's wrong with Na Na?

546
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,449
The guy I encountered while I was pursuing
Lee Kyung Wan

547
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:10,529
knows Na Na and even where she lives too.

He's not your average guy, it seems.

What will happen
if you're discovered by someone?

550
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:14,999
Don't worry.

551
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,419
I'll be careful not to let anything slip.

552
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:21,079
Aigoo, I don't know, no matter how
I think about it, I still feel uneasy.

553
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,119
Ahjussi, just follow my father closely,

554
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,679
if you feel like something's about to slip,
just let me know.

555
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,960
I know, don't worry about me
and take care of yourself.

556
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:32,679
You, if you dare touch a hair
on Na Na's head...

00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,129
I already told you my standards
are really high.

558
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:38,719
But, what is your relationship with Na Na?

559
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,159
No relationship at all.

560
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,699
Shall I pack some side dishes for you?

561
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,179
You can take them and share it with Na Na.

562
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,559
When I was buying fish,
they said it was buy one get one free,

563
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,799
so I bought quite a few.

564
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,549
Just bring some over.

565
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,899
There's also some pickled crab, it's just
pickled nicely, bring everything over.

566
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,189
Am I being married off?

What is this, really...?

568
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:58,890
Just... if Ahjussi is asking you to take it,
just take it.

569
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:03,699
Who gets to use the bathroom first?

570
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,519
Of course, I get to use it first.

571
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,419
That way, you can clean it every time.

572
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:11,659
Then I get to use a clean bathroom everyday.

573
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,550
Oh, right.

574
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,600
You have to clean the dog poop, too.

Do you have anything casual I can wear?

579
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,009
I didn't bring anything to wear to sleep,

580
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,989
the old judo gi was really comfortable
the other time.

581
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,709
What's the use of such a big suitcase,

582
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,919
when you didn't even bring a shirt
you can sleep in.

Hold on.

It's something anyone could forget.

If I had these looks
and was well-prepared too,

586
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:51,970
it would be too tiring to live.

634
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,390
Count to 20, 20.

635
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,849
I've already summoned
Candidate Seo Yong Hak as a witness.

636
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:35,219
Have you not been able contact him?

637
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,059
He was admitted into the hospital,
after that he got discharged.

638
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,709
He has a packed schedule
and says it's really difficult to make time.

639
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:42,770
Are you going to make a trip personally?

640
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,809
I don't have time to meet him today,
I have an appointment.

641
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:47,839
We'll just reschedule the summoning
of Candidate Seo Yong Hak for tomorrow.

642
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,669
Yes, I will make preparations.

643
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:50,570
Oh, right.

644
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,939
Hudson of Maris Company is coming to Korea
the day after tomorrow, right?

645
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,620
Yes, that's right.

646
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:59,460
I'm sorry.

647
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:03,190
The team is a mess, right?

648
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:06,399
Would someone who knows how to worry
about the team do something like this?

649
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,779
Why didn't you just tell
the prosecutor honestly?

650
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,519
This wasn't something
that you, Go Ki Joon, did.

651
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,799
I did it, it's true.

652
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,059
We're both professionals,
you can stop lying to me.

653
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,129
Anyone with a smidgeon of hacking knowledge,

654
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:19,319
wouldn't use that type of method nowadays.

655
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:22,729
That day, after you drank a little,
you spilt the truth, didn't you?

656
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:24,689
Go Ki Joon,
after your brother went to the army,

657
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:25,888
he contracted tetanus

658
00:43:25,889 --> 00:43:29,469
because of his defective boots,
which led to his leg being amputated.

659
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:32,029
And here I thought it was foolproof.

660
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:34,949
Tell the truth to the prosecution.

661
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:38,640
Since I just have to find a new job,
it's fine.

662
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:42,030
But what about my brother?

663
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:45,770
That kid really enjoyed taekwondo.

664
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,999
But now his life is over.

665
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,359
His dream was to run a taekwondo school
and teach children.

666
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,480
But just because of those stupid boots
with soles that fall off,

667
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:00,279
and their refusal to change it,
he ended up with tetanus.

668
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,999
Everyone, including the Board of Inspections
and the Ministry of Defense,

669
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,610
all of them pretended nothing happened.

670
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:09,790
As his hyung,
I couldn't do anything to help.

671
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,069
Then do as you like.

672
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:15,939
I don't have a brother,
so I can't really understand.

673
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,199
Life is a matter of choices,

674
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,810
Nothing is forced.

675
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:49,670
Shouldering this amount of regret,
can get a bit tiresome.

676
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,609
Although it's really a shame
that your leg became this way,

677
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:56,239
but asking your brother
to take the rap for you,

678
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,559
you're destroying him too. Is that it?

679
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,009
Hyung, won't listen to me.

680
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:04,430
Do you not have a mouth?

681
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:07,289
When the incident happened,
Go Ki Joon was at the Blue House.

682
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:09,309
If the truth is uncovered,

683
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:11,559
that will prove
that Go Ki Joon testified falsely.

684
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,980
That will definitely be enough.

685
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,719
The issue with the defective boots,

686
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,070
the Public Prosecutor's Office
has already started looking into it.

687
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:22,459
I think revealing the truth now

688
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:25,560
might be a good thing
for both of you.

689
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,809
Why are your shoulders so hunched?

690
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:45,570
Do you not know how to set
your feet wider apart?

691
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,789
Straighten your upper body,

692
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:47,739
so your two feet are the same
distance apart as your shoulders.

693
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:48,869
How many times do you want me to repeat it?

694
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:51,920
How did you ever get your PhD?

695
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:59,089
How can a man be so easily frightened?

696
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,540
Lower your chin!

697
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:06,399
Professor Lee Yoon Sung!

698
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,739
Da Hye,
access is restricted to staff members only.

699
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,229
What am I allowed to do then?

700
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:13,619
You don't let me do anything,
anything.

701
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:15,429
I want to learn how to shoot too.

702
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:17,079
It's not that you want
to learn how to shoot,

703
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,760
it's that you want to see Professor Lee.

704
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:24,119
Wow, that's so cool.

705
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,229
Teach me too!

706
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:27,319
I want to learn how to shoot too, okay?

707
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,219
Ms. Da Hye, if you really want to, let me...

708
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:33,659
I hope Professor Lee Yoon Sung can teach me.

709
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:34,950
Me?

710
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:39,489
Da Hye, then wear this,

711
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:42,380
if not, you're going to get hurt.

712
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,320
Unni, thank you!

713
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,569
Wow, wearing this,
don't I look really stylish?

714
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:50,340
Right?

715
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:53,100
Stand in the correct position first.

716
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:57,060
Like this?

717
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,179
Your feet have to be the same distance
as the width of your shoulders.

718
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,489
Like that, like that.

719
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:06,130
Then?

720
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:10,569
You have to be focused.

721
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:13,209
Then your right hand grips that gun,

722
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:15,049
and your left hand goes over your right.

723
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:16,320
Aigoo...

724
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:18,969
Is he good enough to be teaching someone?

725
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:23,400
After you hold your breath, and focus...

726
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,900
Pull... the trigger.

727
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,649
It's a lot simpler than I imagined!

728
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:35,039
Don't you know that the more off target
you shoot, the louder the gunshot?

729
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,890
What a show-off.

730
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:46,249
Wow! It's within the 10 point ring!

731
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,239
I must be naturally talented at shooting!

732
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,089
Can my university entrance exams
include marksmanship?

733
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:52,980
I would easily be able
to get into Seoul University then.

734
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:56,119
All this was the work
of Professor Lee Yoon Sung.

735
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,479
Can you teach me one more time?

736
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,679
All right? All right?

737
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,569
- I'm really busy.
- All right? All right?

738
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:03,149
- Teach me.
- Pull her off me!

739
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:07,330
Teach me one more time.

740
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,819
You've had a difficult journey.

741
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:19,060
The representative is waiting for you.

742
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:24,470
Yoon Sung.

743
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:26,489
Hudson is here.

744
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:29,199
Seo Yong Hak's secretary
came to greet him personally.

745
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,870
If we had mistook his arrival time
for tomorrow, we'd have been in big trouble.

746
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:44,400
Okay, later.

747
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:47,089
Did a friend arrive from America?

748
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,390
Yes.

749
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,609
If the incident with Go Ki Joon
didn't happen,

750
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:52,189
you could have let your friend
come visit the Blue House.

751
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:53,209
How nice would that be.

752
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:55,809
Who knew Go Ki Joon
would do something like that?

753
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:58,539
I'm heading out first,
my friend is waiting for me.

754
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:00,059
Then, of course you have to go see him.

755
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:03,387
If America asks you to join them,
it's a definite no, no!

756
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,679
You're here so early?

757
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,829
I'm not late, am I?

758
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:10,189
I can be touched, can't I?

759
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:11,649
Is this something to be touched about?

760
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:12,730
Of course.

761
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:15,319
When we were living together,
wasn't that how it was?

762
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,649
Not fulfilling your promises is a given,

763
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:20,830
and if you do,
I should be weeping with gratitude.

764
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,929
You don't have to feel sorry.

765
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:27,679
I bought you that tie for your birthday.

766
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,859
Is that so?

767
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:29,899
You don't even remember.

768
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,319
Do you remember
you are the one who bought all my ties?

769
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,399
What does that mean?

770
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,260
Have you not gone shopping
since we broke up?

771
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:39,730
Let's go.

772
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:50,660
Hi, Hudson.

773
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:55,630
- Nice to meet you.
- Welcome.

774
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:03,509
Recently, there have been
a lot of first year celebrations.

775
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:07,250
Families usually want to spend
their weekends together.

776
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,289
Emerald Hall...

777
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:17,060
Which way should we go?

778
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,909
Young Joo...

779
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:24,659
I'm sorry, Sae Hee, but you go ahead first.

780
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:25,429
I'll be there in a little bit.

781
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:28,410
Oh, where are you going...?

782
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,519
Now, this is like Kim Young Joo,

783
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,580
always putting work
ahead of everything else.

784
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,990
Why do I feel hurt again?

785
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,739
Ah, Prosecutor Kim...

786
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:53,099
What are you doing here?

787
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:55,709
You've even rejected all of my summons
because of your hospital stay.

788
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:57,419
What are you doing at a hotel?

789
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:01,109
I... passed by here during my inspection
of preparations for the press conference,

790
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:03,639
and I happened to run into someone I know.

791
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:06,229
But, do I have a duty,

792
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:08,859
to report everything to you?

793
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:12,859
Mr. Hudson, I'm Prosecutor Kim,
with the Seoul D.A.'s Office.

794
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:16,730
Wow, prosecutor, huh?

795
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:18,709
Prosecutor Kim!

796
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:22,259
Maris Company
better not make any illegal moves,

797
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:25,529
or tax violations
in its arms trade with Korea.

798
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:27,110
Excuse me?

799
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,989
I'm warning you.

800
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:30,899
Don't look down on Korea.

801
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:33,259
I'm sorry, but I don't understand
what you're talking about.

802
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:37,339
Hey, I haven't been coming down hard
on you because you're a friend's son.

803
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,269
But you have to have a limit, stop now!

804
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:41,769
Even if it's a friend of my father's,
the law is still the law.

805
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:44,720
I'll see you
at the witness cross-examination.

806
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:52,239
Is the D.A.'s Office
still investigating you?

807
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:56,209
A while ago, there was
an assassination attempt on my life.

808
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:58,359
I knew about that,
but this atmosphere now...

809
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:03,029
No matter how I look at it, it is because
I gained a fair bit during the elections.

810
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:06,650
That's why there will always be things
that people want to malign me for.

811
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:44,419
Ahjussi, hold on.

812
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:46,289
If they order room service
from Seo Yong Hak's room,

813
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:49,080
intercept it midway.

814
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:05,819
It's room service.

815
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:06,869
We didn't order it.

816
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:08,649
But an order was placed.

817
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:11,459
A foreign guest ordered coffee and fruits,

818
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,880
that's why I'm bringing it over.

819
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:28,910
Come in.

820
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:33,240
I was right.

821
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:56,540
Hold on.

822
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,360
What?

823
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:01,549
Just leave.

824
00:54:01,550 --> 00:54:03,350
All right.

825
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:08,750
Wait.

826
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:22,190
Thank you.

827
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:24,610
Welcome.

828
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:34,390
Hey, Hudson tipped me 50,000 won.

829
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:40,339
<i>Didn't you decide that
you will help me sell 30 fighter planes?</i>

830
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:42,069
<i>But why are you reneging on your decision?</i>

831
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:44,389
Can you take a look
at the material I prepared?

832
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:45,580
Here.

833
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:52,330
Already...

834
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:55,109
There are defects in the fighter planes
so no one else wants to buy them,

835
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:58,120
and you want to sell them to us?

836
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:01,179
Fighter plane crashes
causing the death of a pilot,

837
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:06,230
in Russia, Georgia, India,
these three countries?

838
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:09,559
Look here, if we make these purchases
and something goes wrong,

839
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,639
you know exactly what will happen, right?

840
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,649
Even if I become president,

841
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:16,479
and an issue like this come up, I would be
impeached and removed from office, too.

842
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,449
Then, are you trying to say
you won't help me?

843
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:20,929
Would you do the same if you were me?

844
00:55:20,930 --> 00:55:24,399
I will report that this deal
has completely fallen through.

845
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,999
What's the rush?

846
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,560
Sit down, sit down.

847
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:31,859
Can't we just import them?

848
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:33,839
But I have a condition.

849
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:37,450
In this transaction, as a handling fee,

850
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:40,489
I want 20 percent of the profits.

851
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:42,210
<i>20 percent?</i>

852
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:46,729
<i>We've never paid such a steep commission
before.</i>

853
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:50,879
It's better than letting them become scrap
metal because no one buys them, right?

854
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,199
Think about it.

855
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,529
Once I become president,

856
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:58,409
I will increase the defense spending
and buy more arms.

857
00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:00,669
That's one of the first priorities
in my policies.

858
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:05,239
If it really happens,
and I become the president of this country,

859
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,269
Maris won't suffer any losses.

860
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:09,259
Do you understand?

861
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:11,199
<i>Then, I'll draw up a contract,</i>

862
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,799
stating that when you become president,
you guarantee not to change your mind.

863
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,200
All right.

864
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:17,569
One more thing.

865
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:21,699
Now, in order to achieve my goals,
I'm doing a deal with Maris.

866
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:27,389
But, if I become president,
I will never buy such inferior weapons.

867
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:28,307
When that time comes,

868
00:56:28,308 --> 00:56:29,308
what we buy from Maris will be
the cream of the crop, with no flaws,

869
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:34,099
the best weapons.

870
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,510
Why?

871
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:38,649
Because more than anyone,

872
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:42,740
I love this country, understand?

873
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,829
To achieve your goals,

874
00:56:54,830 --> 00:56:58,220
you're buying defective fighter planes?

875
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:02,119
You can never become the president.

876
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,019
The fact that someone like that wants to
become the president, is the problem.

877
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:07,130
Look at this society.

878
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,269
I didn't think things
had gotten to this level.

879
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:11,729
Report to Dad
and we'll set the date to take action.

880
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:15,729
Of course! We have to quickly set the dates
to get rid of this bunch of fellas.

881
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:17,159
It's enough to just get rid of them.

882
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:18,079
What's wrong, Ahjussi?

883
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:20,999
Yoon Sung,
I've already finished what I needed to do.

884
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,439
Can I go home first?

885
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,839
I have something important
to do back at home.

886
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:24,949
Something important?

887
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:29,129
The Home Shopping Channel is replaying that
show where the Fat Dad cooks the octopus.

888
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:32,259
You don't know how delicious it is,
it's sold out everyday. I must get it today!

889
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:34,559
We should give it a try too, see how
delicious it is, and cook for your dad.

890
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,899
Then, what about the bug
and the hidden camera in the next room?

891
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:39,199
Of course we should pack it up...

892
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:43,040
- You do it. Good work!
- Ahjussi... Ahjussi!

893
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,839
Will anything really happen tomorrow?

894
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:05,199
After that incident,
we can't let our guard down.

895
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,799
The criminal hasn't been caught yet,

896
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,919
we don't know what else they'll do.

897
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,579
Even if we're supposed to be bullet shields,

898
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:17,860
Are you, Agent Kim, really willing
to block a bullet with your body?

899
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:20,139
Of course we have to.

900
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:22,800
Because I'm an agent.

901
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:28,100
The vents in the ceiling are all checked,
now we just have to check the walls.

902
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:33,439
Congratulations.

903
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,849
After having given birth to three babies,
you guys are the true patriots.

904
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:37,929
You guys have to start loving the country,
too.

905
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:42,049
It's been already been 5 years,
why is there no news yet?

906
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:43,309
What about Sae Hee?

907
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:44,549
What did Sae Hee say when she got here?

908
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:45,630
Sae Hee?

909
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:49,450
Is Sae Hee here?
I haven't seen her.

910
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:10,550
[Kim Young Joo]

911
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:15,630
Dr. Jin Sae Hee.

912
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:20,250
Oh, it's Lee Yoon Sung.

913
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:27,730
[Sae Hee]

914
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:29,659
<i>The number you dialed
is currently unavailable.</i>

915
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:31,409
<i>We're connecting you to the voicemail.</i>

916
00:59:31,410 --> 00:59:35,030
<i>Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

917
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:37,309
Oh, Prosecutor Kim Young Joo.

918
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:38,909
Na Na.

919
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:40,699
What are you doing here?

920
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:42,049
Are you on duty?

921
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:42,970
Yes.

922
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:46,719
There's a press conference tomorrow for the
elections, we came earlier to take a look.

923
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,769
Oh, you've become even busier
after the incident.

924
00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:53,389
Oh, right...
Is the investigation going smoothly?

925
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:55,670
<i>Look here.</i>

926
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,549
Prosecutor Kim.

927
00:59:58,550 --> 01:00:02,289
Are you even investigating
the agents now?

928
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:03,380
No.

929
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:08,209
I'm asking how the investigation is going
with the sniper attack.

930
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:09,689
Is that so?

931
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:11,479
With regard to the sniper at large,

932
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,239
he has a personal vendetta against you,
Sir.

933
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,089
There are a lot more areas to look into.

934
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:19,669
In order for us to wrap the case up quickly,
please offer us your assistance.

935
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:21,040
All right.

936
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:24,329
The person who is the most curious
about who the sniper,

937
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:25,860
is me.

938
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:32,449
This is boring.

939
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:34,909
You actually came here to drink by yourself?

940
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:36,799
Ah, that's right.

941
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,079
The first year celebration...

942
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,199
I came here for a first year celebration.

943
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,349
A first year celebration?

944
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:46,879
Although I'm happy to see you,
I have to go to the celebration.

945
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,669
I've not even given birth to a single child,

946
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:52,619
but my friend has already delivered three.

947
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:55,029
She got married because of me,

948
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:59,860
but she's leading a better life than I,
what a funny friend.

949
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,179
Oh, I'm sorry.
What should I do?

950
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:06,129
No, it's fine.

951
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:08,639
You don't have an important appointment,
do you?

952
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:12,189
No, my friend is here.
I came to find him.

953
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:13,829
I'll go and just get cleaned up.

954
01:01:13,830 --> 01:01:15,029
Then, let's go together.

955
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:16,599
You should take your jacket off,

956
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,729
and I'll wash it immediately
then return it to you.

957
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:19,890
It's fine.

958
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:21,219
It seems you're quite drunk.

959
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:23,629
You helped me the other time
when I was in trouble,

960
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:26,700
how can I pretend nothing happened?

961
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:53,190
Sae Hee!

962
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:08,230
[17th Presidential Primary Election,
New People's Party National Convention]

963
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:12,279
It should be safe tomorrow.

964
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:13,709
There are no places anyone can hide either.

965
01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:15,969
As long as we keep a close eye on
the identities of the reporters tomorrow,

966
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:17,709
there shouldn't be a problem.

967
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:21,349
All right, those whiny reporters,

968
01:02:21,350 --> 01:02:26,329
won't be able to write nonsense
anymore, right?

969
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:28,039
Oh, Agent Kim.

970
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:28,750
Yes.

971
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:30,899
Can you please go up to Room 26
on the 19th floor.

972
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:34,389
Tell them you're my bodyguard,
and bring the documents that I forgot.

973
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:36,849
Don't look at them
bring them here directly.

974
01:02:36,850 --> 01:02:38,949
I'll make a phone call to let them know.

975
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:41,810
Yes, I understand.

976
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:47,250
1925...

977
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:48,690
5...

978
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:50,030
6...?

979
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:51,919
Ah, you idiot.

980
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,210
How could you forget that already?!

981
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:08,220
<i>Yes?</i>

982
01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:54,229
<i>What is Prosecutor Kim Young Joo doing here?</i>

983
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:55,409
<i>Prosecutor?</i>

984
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:56,299
<i>Have you found it?</i>

985
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:59,259
<i>It looks like he isn't
an easy prosecutor to go up against.</i>

986
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:02,309
<i>Your parents are really lucky
to have such a good son like you.</i>

987
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:03,569
<i>I don't have a mother.</i>

988
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:05,789
<i>You have to pay special attention
to how you act.</i>

989
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:07,909
<i>Are you saying
you want to bring me down?</i>

990
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:08,829
<i>Candidate Seo!</i>

991
01:04:08,830 --> 01:04:10,079
<i>Go ahead and try!</i>

992
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,049
<i>Is it really because of a girl?</i>

993
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:12,109
<i>It isn't because of a girl.</i>

994
01:04:12,110 --> 01:04:13,689
<i>Why are you still hesitating?</i>

995
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:14,779
<i>The time isn't right yet.</i>

996
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:18,579
You've become really arrogant
after not seeing you in such a long time.
