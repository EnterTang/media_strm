00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,580
You startled me!

00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,660
Wow! You're showing your true character!

14

that appears to be unfairly
targeting me in an investigation, everybody.

Delicious. Delicious, right?
Just like Mom’s fresh cooking?

142

Would someone like Lee Kyung Wan
know this kind of feeling? Probably not.

145
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,620
It's because he doesn't understand,

146

that's why he's suspected of embezzling
the Hunger Prevention Fund.

147
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,740
What do you mean by that?

Don’t you watch the news?
It was all over the news today.

149

00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:52,990
By the way, you’re getting news
about Na Na, right?

159
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,740
Yes, Na Na's aunt is my investigator.

160
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,600
You really are keeping her on your radar.

161
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:04,390
Kim Young Joo, I’m worried
that you’re too soft-hearted.

162
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,600
Ahh. I’m full.

163
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,550
<i>What is this?</i>

164
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:38,150
<i>My dad marked my height there.</i>

165
00:16:38,151 --> 00:16:40,452
<i>Every first day of the month,
without fail...</i>

166
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,130
Ah...

167
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,780
Ahh...

168
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,050
Ahjussi?

169
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,170
Are you doing well?

170
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,530
Of course I’m doing well.
Loving and receiving love...

171
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:22,224
Ahjussi, what is repossession?
And auction?

172
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:23,693
Did you borrow money from a bank?

173
00:17:23,728 --> 00:17:25,122
Why would I do that?

174
00:17:25,157 --> 00:17:28,760
I think Na Na did,
the girl you asked me to look after.

175
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,710
Is she living a very difficult life?

176
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,070
Yeah, it seems so.

177
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:39,320
Whatever it is, please help her.
Seriously, I’m begging you, Yoon Sung.

178
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,300
Ahjussi, have you ever experienced hunger?

179
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:48,310
Yes, it’s the saddest thing in the world.

180
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,070
It makes you wonder why you were born.

181
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:58,740
It makes you want
to set this hateful world on fire.

182
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,250
And it makes you want to die.
Why?

183
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:06,410
Someone who lets a child starve,
must be a bad person, right?

184
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,830
If you put it like that...

185
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,570
Bas...

186
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,850
Ay, I can't even express it in words.

187
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,740
Someone like that should be dragged to the
gathering point in front of Gwanghuamun,

188
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,060
and be torn apart by horses, ay.

189
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,670
Ah, I suddenly want to eat the fake jambbong
and mixed vegetables that Ahjussi makes.

190
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,360
I miss the food you make,
more than a mother's cooking.

191
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,570
I'm hanging up.

192
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,330
Take care of yourself.

193
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,560
- This is from the Japanese.
- Okay.

194
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,050
How is Huay Ni?

195
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,340
Watching her cry from the pain
was heart wrenching at times.

196
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,590
But I could take care of her,
which was a relief.

197
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,170
After you send her off,

198
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,490
go back to Korea,

199
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,580
and go to Yoon Sung.

200
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,780
What about you, Boss?

201
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,750
Am I going by myself?

202
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,030
That...

203
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,150
That revenge...

204
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,580
can you give it up?

205
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,120
Isn't that the woman in Yoon Sung's photo?

206
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:50,030
So this is the mother who abandoned you?

207
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,760
She doesn't seem like
someone who could do that.

208
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,090
How could she abandon
her own flesh and blood?

209
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,540
Then, I'll go out first.

210
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,090
I've been in politics for over 20 years,
so what occurred yesterday,

211
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,290
of course I've been through
things like that before.

212
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,340
It appears that he's a young prosecutor,

213
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,220
and his youth and energy
are the cause of this misunderstanding.

214
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,550
He's already a grown man,
I don't feel right ordering him around.

215
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,980
I will try and talk to him.

216
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm deeply apologetic.

217
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:30,790
No, you don't have to do that.

218
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,300
If the prosecution issued an arrest warrant,

219
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:38,080
then, doesn't that mean
there's a real cause for suspicion?

220
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,490
What suspicion?

221
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,580
I'm completely innocent!

222
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,020
Are you really innocent?

223
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,040
Of course!

224
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,020
Good.

225
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:51,020
Among all of us who are seated here,

226
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,580
if there really is someone
involved in corruption and bribery,

227
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,350
then, I feel that person should
be severely punished according to the law.

228
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,790
It doesn't matter if it's me or my family,
there will be no exception.

229
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,990
Everybody,

230
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,790
please remember the goals we had
in our hearts when we first started.

231
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,260
Did he become president all by himself?

232
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,100
He hasn't even assumed the position
for a year,

233
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,030
and there are rumors of a lame duck*. (*an
elected official who might not run again)

234
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:24,380
I assume he doesn't want people to gossip.
People who don't bend, will be broken.

235
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,230
If anyone stands in the way of our path,

236
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,330
we can only step over him,
no matter who it is.

237
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,050
I have a prior appointment.

238
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,140
That...

239
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:37,370
Can you postpone
the date of the book launch?

240
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,768
Of course not.

241
00:21:38,769 --> 00:21:43,670
Especially at this juncture,
we have to be more aggressive than ever.

242
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,100
I want to crush those
who think they can defeat us!

243
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,020
Shim Jae Dong just called.

244
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,290
He said he found out the tall guy
is trying to get close with those kids.

245
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,100
Is that so?

246
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:02,370
As long as we find those kids,

247
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:06,360
we can catch the big guy, right?

248
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,580
At the book launch,

249
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,450
get those kids to be flower children.

250
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,140
Yes, Assemblyman.

251
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:33,070
Dad, did something happen again?

252
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,580
You're back.
What about school?

253
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,360
Of course I went and came back.

254
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,770
It's just I had things to worry about, like
Dad, so I took a little break in the middle.

255
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:46,520
For Dad, as long as I smell the scent of
wood, my worries disappear like smoke.

256
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,460
For Dad...

257
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,600
Is wood a remedy?

258
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,130
No matter who it is, I really hope
he won't make Dad worry again.

259
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,570
He's giving you more and more wrinkles.

260
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,800
Aigoo.

261
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,450
The leader in creating wrinkles
on my face is you, Girl.

262
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,430
Ah, yes.

263
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,380
Dad!

264
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:05,200
Can I... change my tutor?

265
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,040
Again?!

266
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,400
There's someone who's really smart,

267
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,540
and it's someone
who works at the Blue House.

268
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,250
Therefore, his background
won't have to be investigated,

269
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,740
and what time I go out
and come home can be regulated too.

270
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,860
Isn't that killing three
or four birds with one stone?

271
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,420
Even so...

272
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:21,050
If the people here all find out
that my daughter is not good at academics,

273
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,140
then where can I show my face?

274
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,000
It's something everyone knows, anyway.

275
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,730
I'll just pick a tutor who's really smart.
All right, Dad?

276
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,000
Hey, hey, you should at least
discuss it with your mom!

277
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,750
Ah... That girl...

278
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,540
Are you late?

279
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,290
This is great.
Give me a ride!

280
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,530
Why should I?

281
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,430
Don't you have a car?

282
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,890
If we go in together,
people will misunderstand.

283
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,550
Run like the wind.

284
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,810
Really...

285
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,370
Ah...
That irritating guy is really frustrating!

286
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:16,090
Even if there's a misunderstanding,
it's I who stands to lose!

287
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,060
Hurry and say it!

288
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,590
Hurry and say yes!
Hurry!

289
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:28,330
I asked you to answer me quickly!

290
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,860
Hey...

291
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,290
- Can you move so I can get out of the car?
- Answer me first.

292
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,240
I told you I wouldn't do it.

293
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,530
Are you all right?

294
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,750
Professor Lee...

295
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,470
You're really rough towards women.

296
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,720
Women?

297
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,260
Who, you?

298
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,710
Then, am I a man?

299
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:53,600
You...

300
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,630
are a girl.

301
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,650
The day after tomorrow
is my coming-of-age day!

302
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,400
I...

303
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,610
My English and math skills are really bad.

304
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,480
If you raise my grades
so I can enter university,

305
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:04,790
my father might give you a really big...

306
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,910
reward, you never know.

307
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,160
Good for you.

308
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,740
Tutor?

309
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:13,110
Which subject? Calculus? That's easy.
Algebra? Statistics?

310
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,080
For English...

311
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,470
The active voice? Or the tenses?

312
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,901
When I started in university,
they called me the king of all trades.

313
00:25:18,902 --> 00:25:20,102
Are you going to do it or not?

314
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,430
Didn't I say I wouldn't already?

315
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:25,190
Not only is your brain bad,
but do your ears not work either?

316
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,060
How many times do I have to tell you?

317
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,520
If you don't want to tutor me,

318
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,250
then date me!

319
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,490
I will...

320
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,390
Hey, Kid.

321
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,320
I said I wasn't a kid already!

322
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,940
I know Little Da Hye
has really high standards,

323
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,430
but you're not my type.

324
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:48,360
Should I buy you a full-length mirror?

325
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,230
Yes, Chief.

326
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,330
What?

327
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,700
Hacking?

328
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,290
I understand.

329
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,510
Go sunbae, run.

330
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:03,980
I will make him do it!

331
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,400
Da Hye, let's find another tutor.

332
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,110
That guy is dangerous.

333
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:12,160
How would Unni know
if he's dangerous or not?

334
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,710
Chief, you want to sit at the side, right?

335
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,050
- Change my seat.
- Yes!

336
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,600
Lee Yoon Sung.

337
00:26:19,601 --> 00:26:21,989
- Lee Yoon Sung!
- What?

338
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:24,080
Why aren't you using formal speech
in the workplace?

339
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,020
So what?!

340
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,840
The first lady says she wants to see you.

341
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,740
The first lady?

342
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,930
I have a lunch date.
I'm just on my way out.

343
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,020
A lunch date?

344
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,140
Yeah.

345
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,010
I will simply go crazy
if I don't see this person every single day.

346
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,580
Bye!

347
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:49,030
He rations every minute and second to date.

348
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,800
That's great, really.

349
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:53,070
Dad!

350
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,430
Aigoo...

351
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,780
How am I going to survive?

352
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:11,020
You should have lived
so we could come back together.

353
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,580
How am I going to live by myself?

354
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,250
Aigoo, I'm so scared.

355
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,100
Ahjussi!

356
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,640
Yoon Sung!

357
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,340
Yoon Sung!

358
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:29,520
Huay Ni is gone!

359
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,470
Bury it in your heart.

360
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:35,730
We'll live a good life together.

361
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:38,420
Wow, you look great.

362
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,532
How do I look?
Like a different person, right?

363
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:41,033
Oh, yes.

364
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,220
Aigoo, my wife...

365
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,450
- My wife.
- I missed you, Ahjussi.

366
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,160
Me too.

367
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,250
Have you eaten?

368
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,780
Wow!

369
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,000
Is this a house, or a palace?

370
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,830
You know I don't like mess
in my house, right?

371
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,910
Yes.

372
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,260
Bring in your luggage and unpack first,

373
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:03,400
I'll come back after work.

374
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:10,070
Wow... The heating of this house
must cost a good amount of money.

375
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:32,760
<i>Why aren't you using
your driver or errand girl?</i>

376
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:52,060
<i>Have you gone money-crazy?
Go to sleep.</i>

377
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,200
Money-crazy?

378
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,910
Look at the way he talks.

379
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:57,740
What an irritating fellow.

380
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,300
What?

381
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,830
No, nothing.

382
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,590
Mi Jin and Do Jin have been selected to be
flower children at tomorrow's book launch.

383
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,720
They are making paper flowers,
don't even try looking for me.

384
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,270
Unni, what did you say?

385
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,040
Hurry and make them.

386
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:18,050
Unni is getting faster and faster.

387
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,760
Flower children?

388
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,590
Why does he need flower children
for the book launch?

389
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,480
Mr. Yoon Sung, drink some coffee
before continuing with your work.

390
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,100
This is your favorite Thai coffee.

391
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,630
Ahjussi, your coffee-brewing skills
are also first-rate.

392
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,450
Ah, it's so bitter.

393
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,020
Was it always so bitter?

394
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,270
Oh, your taste has changed.

395
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:51,250
Ah, these few days I've been drinking
the coffee that person makes for me.

396
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,860
Makes coffee for you?

397
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:53,730
Oh...

398
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,580
There's just someone.

399
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,770
Work hard.

400
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,140
Ahjussi.

401
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,020
There's something
I need you to help me with tomorrow.

402
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:01,860
I'm counting on you.

403
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:04,677
If you say you need help,
I will definitely help!

404
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,870
Public opinion has been getting really loud
over your issue.

405
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:17,500
The law might bend to your will, but the
public might not necessarily do the same.

406
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,840
I'm Lee Kyung Wan.

407
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,540
I won't be beaten down
because of such a small matter.

408
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:22,449
Don't worry.

409
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,450
Do you...

410
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,430
think I'm worrying about you?

411
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,620
I've even forged the loan documents for you.

412
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,260
That...

413
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,710
They say the flower children are here.

414
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:39,180
Could I... borrow that guy over there?

415
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,580
Once I settle this,

416
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:44,570
I should be able to find the guy
who put me in this troublesome situation.

417
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,480
Hello.

418
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,080
Ah, Assemblyman!

419
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:58,100
I'm Reporter Lee Young Joo,
from Korea Daily.

420
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,020
Regarding the bribery case involving Haewon
Construction and Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan,

421
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:03,270
- The lowering of construction standards...
- I apologize.

422
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,230
Let's go.

423
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,230
Hold on...

424
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,900
I don't think this is going to work.

425
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,920
Make sure Lee Kyung Wan is more careful.

426
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,330
You follow Lee Kyung Wan.
Watch him well.

427
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,030
Yes.

428
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:20,550
Hurry, come over.

429
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,560
Is everything all right?

430
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,070
You've arrived?

431
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,870
You've come too.

432
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,870
This time,
what evidence are you looking for?

433
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,420
If you want to stir up something,
you better leave.

434
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:36,430
Didn't you teach me to know my enemies?

435
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:37,540
Of course I have to do so.

436
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,710
Enemies?

437
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,448
I would like to find out

438
00:31:39,449 --> 00:31:42,249
who’s using the citizens?tens of thousands
of dollars just to buy a nail.

439
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:44,080
I have to find out what's going on too.

440
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,520
I'll see you later.

441
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,490
He really has some guts.

442
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,130
I'm sorry.

443
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,710
That child still has a lot to learn.

444
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,672
Having gone through turmoil

445
00:31:57,673 --> 00:32:00,478
in the political circle, he has become
very politically-driven as well.

446
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:03,110
Only having tasted the perils of the world,

447
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,330
will he come around.

448
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,120
What did you bring these for?

449
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:56,610
The assemblyman is over there, go greet him.

450
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:01,350
Go wait at the entrance.

451
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,570
Kim Na Na!

452
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:06,980
Oh, Prosecutor Kim Young Joo.

453
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,450
But, Kim Na Na, why are you here?

454
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:13,520
I had to bring the children
who have been chosen as flower children.

455
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:17,800
Oh, I saw on TV, what you were investigating
at the club the other time.

456
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,900
That was your work, right?

457
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,340
Yes.

458
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,360
You must protect the law.

459
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,790
The justice of the nation is still alive.

460
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:30,170
This is all a sham put up
by Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan.

461
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,450
I know that too.

462
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:36,360
No matter how he lies to the people,
he can't cheat my conscience, can he?

463
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,250
It's good you can be so strong, Na Na.

464
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,400
Let's go.

465
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,820
All right.

466
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,440
<i>Hello.</i>

467
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,840
Today is the book launch for
Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan's 6th book,

468
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:53,830
"The Day the Citizens' Tears Fall
is the Time I Weep."

469
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:54,880
Thank you for coming.

470
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,180
To kick start the event,

471
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:59,410
Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan, who has recently
been feeling some political pressure,

472
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,070
the defender of democracy,

473
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:03,160
his journey so far,

474
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:05,330
let's discover it through the big screen!

475
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:08,500
<i>May 1st, 1948.</i>

476
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:12,790
<i>Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan, born in
Gyeonggi-do, the second son of his family...</i>

477
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:13,650
You...

478
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:17,480
You can't believe everything
you heard on the news.

479
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,040
Those are...

480
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:24,430
fake images that people

481
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,680
All right, all right.

482
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:30,140
It's these children.

483
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,840
Oh, Do Jin.

484
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:33,580
Min Jun.

485
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,380
You...

486

You know these children?

487

They're from my class.

488
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,470
The beggars from my class...

489

Hey!

490
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:44,120
Didn't you get all the coupons last time?

491
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,770
Only children with empty stomachs
will do that kind of thing.

492
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,520
All right, all right.

493

Hey.

494
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,130
All right, all right, Min Jun,
go to your mother.

495
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,790
Yes.

496
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:59,760
Oh, all right.
You guys are so cute.

497
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,390
All right, what are your names?

498
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,440
Soon Mi Jin.

499

All right, Mi Jin.

How about you?

501
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,200
Soon Do Jin.

502

Do Jin.

503
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:11,720
All right, all right, Do Jin.

You know that tall man?

507
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,180
The ahjussi who looks dopey?

508
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,450
How could you say that about...

509
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,280
Hyung?

510
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:23,390
Ah, all right, all right.

511
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:25,050
You know him!

512
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:27,650
All right.
Where's that hyung right now?

513
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,320
Hello?

514
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:39,720
<i>It seems you're looking for me right now.</i>

515
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,450
No matter what, they're
from the same class as your grandson,

516
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,900
that's going a little too far.

517
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,200
You...

518
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,550
Where are you?

519
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,230
Where are you hiding right now?

520
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:51,780
Stop keeping those frowning kids,

521
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:53,460
just let them go right now.

522
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,000
I will personally come to you.

523
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,590
All right.

524
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,030
If you don't keep your promise
to appear obediently,

525
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,580
I can't guarantee the children's safety.

526
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,790
Let's go.

527
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,060
Take him in!

528
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,570
You actually slithered all the way here.

529
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,690
You're not too bad, I see.

530
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,540
Who are you?

531
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,080
Me?

532
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:58,190
I'm just someone who hates people
who let poor children starve,

533
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,470
a jobless guy.

534
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:01,420
A jobless guy?

535
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,060
Who are you?

536
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:06,180
The fellow who stole my money.

537
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:07,340
What?

538
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,040
"My money"?

539
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:13,540
How could taxes become your money?

540
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,420
Isn't this just daylight robbery?

541
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,480
What?

542
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,360
Robbery?

543
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,260
Do you think the nation is an orphanage?

544
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,920
For someone whose parents
don't even know of their existence,

545
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,470
why should the nation
bear that responsibility?

546
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,285
The taxes of the nation,

547
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:30,955
so what if I took a little?

548
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,880
Even if I don't take it, someone else
would have done the same and taken it.

549
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:36,575
Even so, for the nation and its citizens,

550
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:38,930
it would go to much better use
if I use this money.

551
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:42,660
That's how I become the warrior who uses
his body and mind to defend democracy!

552
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,450
Mm, your body and mind?

553
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,890
With just a little power,
your entire body and mind rotted with it.

554
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,960
At such a young age, you already want
to become a hero, and do battle with me.

555
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:57,100
Even so, the law will be on my side.

556
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,400
Why?

557
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,830
Because I have power
that you will never have.

558
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,170
That's what power is like.

559
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,560
That's why people all fight for power.

560
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,430
People like you,

561
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,000
I eat you for food.

562
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:09,610

Just leave everything here to my men
and leave first.

(*student-led movement, fought for citizens)

But I...

00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,520
Yes, this is Kim Young Joo.

644
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:38,710
Lee Kyung Wan, that piece of trash,

645
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,640
I'll give him to you to handle.

646
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,250
Hold on...

647
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,760
No wonder you're the team leader.

648
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:53,580
I was still wondering why we were
rolling in the dirt in the Golden Triangle.

649
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:57,290
Ah, it's really as simple
as a small side dish, a small side dish.

650
00:45:57,310 --> 00:45:58,400
You were almost flying.

651
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,540
Swoosh swoosh...

652
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:07,370
What are you doing?

653
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,070
I don't want to leave evidence,
so I have to throw it away.

654
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,700
But,

655
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:15,000
did you get the boss's permission
to do this?

656
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:17,280
I don't think he'll let you off easily.

657
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:19,670
Killing him isn't my method.

658
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,830
Destroying him completely,

659
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,760
that's my method.

660
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,430
Where are you?

661
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,030
The view by the river is nice,

662
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:38,030
and the kids looked a little bored too,

663
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:39,930
so we came to the park by the Han River.

664
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:40,910
Why?

665
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,170
Did you want me to run errands
and drive you again?

666
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:43,010
Make me a cup of coffee.

667
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:43,990
I'll give you two stamps.

668
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:45,340
Hey, Lee Yoon Sung!

669
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:47,110
- What do you...
- I'll give you the stamps once I get there.

670
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:48,660
If not, nothing.

671
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:51,530
The musical fountain at the Han River Park.
Come over and see for yourself.

672
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,420
Ahjussi, you go first.

673
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:57,950
Just take me to where the car is parked.

674
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,080
Why?

675
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:01,850
We should at least
have a party to celebrate.

676
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:04,380
We'll have the party later.

677
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:07,070
I don't know why, I want some sweet coffee.

678
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,290
Kids!

679
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,050
Kids, come here!

680
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:49,470
Let's play together, it will be fun!

681
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:52,840
I'm not in the mood to play right now.

682
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:55,990
When I grow up, I'm going to leave Korea.

683
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:57,260
It's all fake.

684
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:59,310
There are no adults whom I can trust.

685
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:02,530
I say, Little Miss,
were you lied to growing up?

686
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:06,290
Don't be mad.

687
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:07,540
Think about it from her standpoint.

688
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,320
She really isn't in the mood today.

689
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:10,980
Really?

690
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:12,570
Ah, but there are no such fountains
in America.

691
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:15,050
I thought it was really fun and cool.

692
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:19,550
Ah, it's great for washing off the horrible
feelings after being rejected by a woman.

693
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:23,230
Let's go!

694
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:25,560
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

695
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,500
Didn't you ask me to make coffee?

696
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:29,380
This isn't bad.

697
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:34,040
Ah, that's delicious.

698
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:37,150
At first,
I wasn't really feeling great today.

699
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:39,020
But seeing the kids cheer up,

700
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:41,330
I've cheered up too.

701
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:01,600
Why were these military dog tags,
hanging around your neck, Assemblyman?

702
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:03,420
That...

703
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:06,340
How would I know that?

704
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:11,320
Listen to me,
if you were really a prosecutor,

705
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:15,050
you would catch the guy
who turned me into this.

706
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,745
In Korea...!
What's the system coming to,

707
00:50:17,746 --> 00:50:20,767
if an assemblyman
can be brought to this state?!

708
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:22,670
Of course we will catch him.

709
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:23,642
But why would he kidnap

710
00:50:23,643 --> 00:50:26,653
the assemblyman, and bring him
to the Public Prosecutor's Office,

711
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:27,900
I'm more curious about that.

712
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,110
Only that fellow would know about that,
how would I know?

713
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:33,820
If you still don't know,

714
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,830
I will tell you personally in court.

715
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:39,140
Look here.

716
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,980
Your father,

717
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:44,260
could end up the way I did too,

718
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:46,240
you know?

719
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:49,700
Please do not insult my father.

720
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:52,640
All right, all right, all right.

721
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,850
Let's see.

722
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:57,710
- Investigator Jang Pil Jae.
- Yes.

723
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,810
Investigator Kim Mi Ok.

724
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:08,130
Yes, Prosecutor.

725
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,590
Please try and find some information
on these military dog tags.

726
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:11,810
I already did.

727
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,650
There was no information
on all three of them.

728
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,560
Ah, he has drooled all over me again!

729
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,240
Ah, children drooling when they're asleep
is very normal, why are you so harsh?

730
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:28,630
In any case, it's wet already,
it has to be washed sooner or later!

731
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:31,110
- This has to be dry-cleaned.
- Sheesh...

732
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,290
Do Jin,

733
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:35,150
wake up, let's go home and sleep.

734
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,270
Noona,

735
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:38,380
are we home?

736
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:39,170
Yes.

737
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,690
Goodbye.

738
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,570
Thank you.

739
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:44,590
Goodnight!

740
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:48,890
Ah, it's cold.
Let's go.

741
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,600
Where?

742
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:52,380
Your house!

743
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,520
Why are you going into a girl's house?

744
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:56,110
Who's a girl?

745
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,640
You, who flips me over her shoulder
every day?

746
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,590
I say...!

747
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:02,420
It's cold!

748
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,270
<i>Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan,
who has been officially arrested by</i>

749
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,940
<i>Prosecutor Kim Young Joo
of the Seoul District Prosecutor's Office...</i>

750
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,330
What is that boy Yoon Sung doing?!

751
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:15,890
<i>has expressed that he
will act according to the law...</i>

752
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:31,320
[Father]

753
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,720
You're not picking it up?

754
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,280
<i>We're unable to connect you at this time
and are transferring you to voicemail.</i>

755
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:44,550
<i>Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

756
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:46,960
Is it a woman again?

757
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,600
Which woman is it this time?

758
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,940
Does that woman know?

759
00:52:56,970 --> 00:52:59,350
That you are a man who picks
out his vegetables and doesn't eat them?

760
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:01,610
What kind of japchae has no meat?

761
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:02,960
I did a lot of things today.

762
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:05,730
Oh, you act like
you accomplished something huge.

763
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,870
If there's no meat,
at least give me some tofu!

764
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:09,050
The beans are the tofu!

765
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:11,089
The meat that grows out of the ground.

766
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:11,790
I...

767
00:53:11,791 --> 00:53:13,910
I don't eat beans.

768
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,660
Oh!

769
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:17,900
It's Prosecutor Kim Young Joo.

770
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:22,740
Wow, some people do such huge things.

771
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,670
Some people only know
how to look down on side dishes.

772
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:26,942
Do you not see
how some people run around

773
00:53:26,943 --> 00:53:29,184
trying to catch
corrupt government officials?

774
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:30,850
Reflect a little, reflect.

775
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:32,240
Is that something so great?

776
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:34,000
Of course.

777
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,260
With such people like
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo around,

778
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,100
you have no idea how secure it feels.

779
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,510
<i>The assemblymen are all rotten and corrupt.</i>

780
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:46,390
<i>This is all a trick that they've discussed.</i>

781
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:50,070
<i>The fact that the government
will protect these thieves...</i>

782
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,680
<i>I think they should just get rid
of the government, it would be better.</i>

783
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:55,940
<i>Who in the world should the citizens trust?</i>

784
00:53:55,970 --> 00:54:00,150
<i>A city hunter who hunts criminals
like Lee Kyung Wan...</i>

785
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:03,910
- The city hunter should be given a medal.
- City hunter?

786
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:06,240
That's pretty accurate, City Hunter.

787
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:09,970
The City Hunter who sends all the bad
people to the Public Prosecutor's Office.

788
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,790
Who is it?

789
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,660
Who could it be?

790
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:17,650
Who could it be?

791
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,520
Hey, do you really have no tofu?

792
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:22,840
Do you want me to go out and buy it?!

793
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:25,280
Why do you have nothing else to eat
but kimchi?

794
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:28,310
Then why in the world
do you want to eat here?

795
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,880
Ah, sorry.

796
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:32,930
Yoon Sung!

797
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:39,620
This is for you.

798
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,810
I saw you enjoyed the kimchi.

799
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:43,710
Forget it.
You eat it.

800
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:45,710
My aunt always sends me some.

801
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:46,720
When I give it to you, take it.

802
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:49,120
Next time, even if you demand it from me,
I won't give it.

803
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:52,560
Ah, it will make the car smell.

804
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:55,520
This doesn't smell.

805
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:57,620
Thank you for playing with the kids today.

806
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,470
Goodbye.

807
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:08,180
[Father]

808
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,150
Yes.

809
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:18,670
Is that all?

810
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,930
The method you said you had
for destroying him?

811
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,760
How could you believe
the prosecutors and send him there?

812
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:24,060
The inability to do anything
in the face of power,

813
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,760
that is the definition
of the prosecutors of Korea.

814
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:28,490
But I still wanted to believe in him once.

815
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:29,930
That belief has no use.

816
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,410
You will be defeated
by these weird ideas you have.

817
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:34,070
You should have killed that fellow.

818
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:37,630
The method where people
will never be able to forgive him,

819
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:39,630
there's only this.

820
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:53,900
What is all this?

821
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,510
Kitchenware.

822
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:57,390
Yoon Sung, Korea is really a heaven.

823
00:55:57,410 --> 00:55:59,890
One phone call and they deliver everything.

824
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:00,950
This frying dish,

825
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,050
it won't burn even if you don't add oil.

826
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,520
This pot!

827
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:08,530
Even if it doesn't have water,
you can cook radishes and pumpkins.

828
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:09,590
This is a free gift.

829
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:12,110
Where is there a heaven like this?

830
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,050
Huay Ni should have enjoyed
good days like these too...

831
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:17,140
What should I do about this poor person?

832
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:18,610
Ah, Huay Ni...

833
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:20,420
Ah, my head...

834
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:21,430
How about the bill?

835
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,210
Whose card is it?

836
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:25,030
Of course it isn't mine,
I just got here.

837
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:26,360
Ahjussi, are you crazy?

838
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:28,140
Did I buy this for myself? Of course
I bought this to make food for you!

839
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,630
Did you marry me?

840
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:31,170
- Is this a dowry?
- Hey, Kid!

841
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,422
I planned to cook food for you
with a maternal heart,

842
00:56:32,423 --> 00:56:34,972
why are you spouting so much rubbish?

843
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:39,370
Have you tried looking for your mother?

844
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:41,710
I heard she's alive.

845
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:45,730
What use is there looking for her?

846
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:47,800
Someone who abandoned me
to live a good life...

847
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:48,870
But she's still your mother!

848
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:50,810
Blood is thicker than water!

849
00:56:50,830 --> 00:56:52,540
Ah, enough...
Stop.

850
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,620
Yoon Sung...

851
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:55,470
Yoon Sung!

852
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,920
This kid, really...

853
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:02,980
I have to pack...

854
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:04,810
I have to pack.

855
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:13,210
Ah, that kid... His mouth is so hard,
but he has a heart as soft as tofu.

856
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:15,210
He is old beyond his years.

857
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:18,960
Pal Pan Gab?

858
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:20,810
It's a guy who is like a ghost.

859
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:25,360
No matter what, we can't track his IP,
and even if we find it, it's the Blue House.

860
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:28,300
It seems someone is hacking into our system
and playing around.

861
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:31,640
He's making a mockery of our
country's reputation for being strong in IT.

862
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:32,800
Why don't...

863
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,430
you kill me, Mr. President?

864
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:35,630
No, Chief.

865
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:39,240
We suffered a hacking attack while
I wasn't paying attention, it's my fault.

866
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:40,520
Mr. President!

867
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,320
I'm willing to die in place of the Chief!

868
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:43,770
Ah, to tackle this,

869
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:48,120
just strengthen the security of our
technology systems, don't worry too much.

870
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,674
The important thing
is the embezzlement of the taxes,

871
00:57:51,709 --> 00:57:53,418
and furthermore,
it was carried out by an assemblyman.

872
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,020
Allowing the kids whose lives
are already difficult to starve...

873
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,930
The fury of the public is to be expected.

874
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,420
Director.

875
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:01,840
Using this incident as an example,

876
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:04,200
we must make every public servant aware,

877
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,940
and Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan must
be punished severely as the law dictates.

878
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,430
Yes.

879
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:17,090
Also...

880
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:19,890
there were three sets of military dog tags

881
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:22,460
hanging from
Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan's neck.

882
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:23,830
Military dog tags?

883
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:24,790
Yes.

884
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,140
I don't know why,

885
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:28,640
but in October 1983,

886
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,270
there were people
with secret identities,

887
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:34,610
who went missing on the same day.

888
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:40,530
Although they shared the
similarity of being special agents...

889
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:46,020
No matter what, we'll temporarily stop
further investigations.

890
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,450
Elders,

891
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:18,788
I'm sorry to bother you,
but do you know where this building is?

892
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:22,540
Isn't this Pal Pang Gab?

893
00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:24,010
Is there...

894
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:28,100
anyone who is familiar with Pal Pang Gab?

895
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:30,650
Isn't this Kyung Hee?

896
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,580
That's right, this is Kyung Hee.

897
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:34,720
She was a pretty famous ahgassi then.

898
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:36,480
Ah, is that so?

899
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:37,900
Then...

900
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,131
Do you know where she is right now?

901
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:41,910
Yoon Sung!

902
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:44,130
Yoon Sung, Yoon Sung, Boy...

903
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:46,050
What is it this time?

904
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:47,550
An iron?

905
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:49,230
An entire kitchen set?

906
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:52,450
You are casually swiping my card everywhere,
but a little bill will come soon.

907
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,210
No, it's not that.

908
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:56,090
I seem to have found it.

909
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:57,800
What did you find?

910
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,240
Your mother!

911
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:01,980
I found out where she is.

912
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:02,820
You're happy, right?

913
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:05,130
You feel blessed, right?

914
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,780
I've said this many times before, Kid, at
times like this, you're supposed to smile!

915
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:09,630
Who did you find?

916
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:10,860
Mother?

917
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:12,690
Whose mother?

918
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:15,940
When did I have a mother?

919
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,720
Kid...

920
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:20,340
Don't ever do anything like that again.

921
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:22,650
I don't have the time...

922
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,700
to look for someone who abandoned me.

923
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:30,910
I'm busy.
Go out first.

924
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:40,700
It's here, it's here.
This is the address.

925
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:43,830
When you feel better, go take a look.

Yes, how can I help you?
