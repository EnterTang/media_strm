等过了特拉法加广场我就摘下来

491
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,200
WATSON: If you believe Moriarty
has you under observation...

492
00:18:27,654 --> 00:18:30,297
如果莫里亚蒂的人在跟踪你的话

493
00:18:30,378 --> 00:18:32,140
这样子是不是太显眼了

494
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,120
...isn't this a bit conspicuous?

495
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,663
高调到极致 就是隐蔽

496
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,600
HOLMES: It's so overt, it's covert.

497
00:18:39,148 --> 00:18:42,392
特拉法加广场 你应该安全了

498
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,560
WATSON: Trafalgar Square. You must be safe by now.

499
00:18:43,714 --> 00:18:44,555
好吧

500

(GRUNTS)

501
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,880
Why are you looking at me with such concern?

502
00:18:50,201 --> 00:18:52,925
为什么你这么忧虑地看着我

503
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,680
I'm so very worried. Your vitality's
been drained from you.

504
00:18:53,045 --> 00:18:54,366
因为我很担心你

505
00:18:55,047 --> 00:18:56,889
你的生命力都快干涸了

506
00:18:57,931 --> 00:19:00,053
婚姻是坟墓 我告诉你

507
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,600
- Marriage is the end, I tell you.
- I think of it as the beginning.

508
00:19:00,093 --> 00:19:01,495
我认为是个新开始

509
00:19:01,615 --> 00:19:02,256
世界末日

510
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,040
- Armageddon.
- Rebirth.

511
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,057
重获新生

512
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,720
- Restriction.
- Structure.

513
00:19:03,217 --> 00:19:03,858
一种束缚

514
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:04,659
一个归宿

515
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:05,620
听女人的使唤

516
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,560
- Answering to a woman.
- Being in a relationship.

517
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,582
经营一段感情

518
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,040
A life in matrimony, the possibility of a family.

519
00:19:08,343 --> 00:19:09,545
和谐美满的生活

520
00:19:09,705 --> 00:19:11,026
还有共享天伦之乐

521
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,840
Who wants to die alone?

522
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:13,950
谁愿意孤独终老

523
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,040
We'll have a good old-fashioned romp tonight...

524
00:19:15,111 --> 00:19:16,713
所以我们今天按照惯例彻夜狂欢

525
00:19:16,873 --> 00:19:18,595
然后你去结婚生子 而我

526
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,720
...you'll settle down, have a family, and I'll die alone.

527
00:19:19,797 --> 00:19:20,558
孤独终老

528
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,240
WATSON: Yes, that's about it.

529
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:22,320
差不多是这样

530
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,760
Perhaps it's better for one to die alone
than to live life in eternal purgatory.

531
00:19:25,283 --> 00:19:27,486
我想孤独终老至少也胜过

532
00:19:28,407 --> 00:19:30,650
一辈子活在人间地狱

533
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,600
Anyway...

534
00:19:34,094 --> 00:19:34,855
随你便啦

535
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,960
Not bad, that.

536
00:19:40,422 --> 00:19:41,303
灯还不错

537
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,960
So where are we going?

538
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,106
我们要去哪儿

539
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,760
MYCROFT: In the future, there'll be one of
those machines in every town in Europe.

540
00:19:44,186 --> 00:19:47,670
未来这种机器会遍布欧洲的大街小巷

541
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,480
Loitering in the woodshed again, are we, Myccie?

542
00:19:47,991 --> 00:19:50,594
又在柴房里游荡了 是吗 迈克

543
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,800
- Good evening, Sherly.
- Well.

544
00:19:50,794 --> 00:19:51,715
晚上好 歇利

545
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:52,516
好

546
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,640
I see your bootmaker is ill, dear brother.

547
00:19:53,037 --> 00:19:55,520
看来你的修鞋匠病了 亲爱的弟弟

548
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,960
As I detect that you've recently changed
the brand of soap with which you shave.

549
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,845
我发觉你换了一个牌子的肥皂来刮胡子

550
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,320
The chimney in the front room at Baker Street...

551
00:20:00,205 --> 00:20:02,368
我想说你贝克街前厅的烟囱

552
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,320
...still needs a damn good sweeping up.

553
00:20:02,488 --> 00:20:04,490
真的应该再好好打理一下才行

554
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,320
Were you aware that the hackney carriage by
which you arrived had a damaged wheel?

555
00:20:04,651 --> 00:20:08,495
你是否发现来时坐的马车有个轮子坏了

556
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,280
Yes, the left. And it's plain to
the meanest intelligence...

557
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,537
当然 左轮

558
00:20:09,897 --> 00:20:12,820
而且再笨的人也能猜到你最近给小提琴

559
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,880
...that you have recently acquired
a new bow for your violin.

560
00:20:12,941 --> 00:20:15,143
买了把新琴弓

561
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,720
Same bow, new strings.

562
00:20:15,343 --> 00:20:16,825
老琴弓 新琴弦

563
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,280
And may I deduce, Mycroft...?
Good evening, by the way.

564
00:20:16,985 --> 00:20:17,987

迈克罗夫特 晚上好

566
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,351
免了

567
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,680
No.

568

他不握手

569
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,760
- He doesn't.
- May I deduce that you...

570
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:27,238
依我之见像你这样一个

571
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:30,080
...who rarely strays from the path that runs
from your home to the Diogenes Club...

572
00:20:27,678 --> 00:20:30,281
不是在家就是在第欧根尼俱乐部

573
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,840
...and never on a Monday when they
serve your favorite potted shrimps...

574
00:20:30,402 --> 00:20:33,886
而且从不错过每星期一小锅炒虾的人

575
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:39,092
来此必有比参加单身派对更重要的原因

576
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,960
...must be here for some far more important
reason than my stag party?

577
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:45,000
You know, he's nothing like as slow-witted as
you'd been leading me to believe, Sherly.

578
00:20:39,933 --> 00:20:41,935
我觉得他根本就不是你说的

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,280
...but with all the conflict in Europe at the
moment, the whole situation could...

请让一让

585
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,600
Excuse me.... suddenly erupt.

586

00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,680
I am here to avoid a dire catastrophe.

00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:58,195
我来这里是要阻止一场大灾难

589
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,520
If the concerns of two nations...

590
00:20:58,996 --> 00:21:02,080
某两个国家关系很紧张

591
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,680
...which shall remain nameless...

592
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,683
我不能透露它们的名字

593
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:09,200
...but I can tell you they speak French and German...

594
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:08,968
但它们分别说的是法语和德语

595
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,880
...are not dealt with tonight, I shall
be forced to go to Switzerland...

596
00:21:09,488 --> 00:21:12,732
今晚若调解不好 我就不得不去瑞士

597
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,440
...to attend the ghastly peace summit in Reichenbach.

瑞士最讨厌的就是海拔太高

600
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,880
The worst thing about Switzerland is the altitude.

601
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,360
It gives me nosebleeds, exacerbates my asthma-1...

602
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,463
又让我流鼻血又加重我的哮喘

603
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,800
I'm so glad you invited your brother.

604
00:21:21,543 --> 00:21:24,026

may need several more chairs.

先从香槟开始吧

613
00:21:45,372 --> 00:21:46,733
我们可能还要几把椅子

00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,840
Perhaps a good cigar.

615

给我来一支雪茄

616
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,600
And don't bother with the chairs.

617

What is it your brother does exactly?

He's the keeper of the broom cupboard of state.

652
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,040
All of them? Hmm. The chaps from my medical school?

653
00:22:32,949 --> 00:22:35,231
都没空吗 那我在医学院的那些同学呢

654
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,280
- They declined.
- The lads from the regiment?

655
00:22:35,392 --> 00:22:36,193
我叫了 他们不来

656
00:22:36,353 --> 00:22:37,234
那军队里的战友呢

657
00:22:37,394 --> 00:22:38,395
没有人比他更加

658
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,120
- No man's better worth having at your side...
- Who is it you're looking for?

659
00:22:38,555 --> 00:22:39,196
那你到底在找谁

660
00:22:39,356 --> 00:22:40,598
值得你去结交

661
00:22:40,758 --> 00:22:43,521
因为这里我一个认识的人都没有 对吗

662
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,920
Because I don't know a single damn person here, do I?

663
00:22:43,681 --> 00:22:44,883
你这么激动干什么

664
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,640
There's no need for hysterics.
You know me and Mycroft.

665
00:22:45,043 --> 00:22:47,246
你认识我 认识迈克罗夫特

666
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,960
- Don't be a ponce, Watson.
- Ponce?

00:22:47,406 --> 00:22:48,688
别那么饥渴 华生

668
00:22:49,248 --> 00:22:49,889
饥渴

669
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,320
You completely forgot about my stag party, didn't you?

670
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:54,294
你完全忘了我的单身派对 是不是

671
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,160
- Why are we here?
- Your very good health, doctor.

672
00:22:56,577 --> 00:22:57,298
来这里做什么

673
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:58,900
祝你身体健康 大夫

674
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,383
很遗憾你的朋友们都没来

675
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,440
Shame none of your friends could make it.

for this night to be a total loss.

把结婚戒指给我

So now you're interested in being the best man.

685
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,643
现在怎么想起来自己是伴郎了

686
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,000
You're supposed to keep the ring anyway.

687
00:23:18,643 --> 00:23:20,806
戒指确实应该由你保管没错

688

- And invite my friends...

From what does she seek solace?
What does she not wish to see?

Not bad, but you have to make me believe you.

还不错 但是

745
00:25:22,512 --> 00:25:24,034
你还不足以让我信服

The Devil.

一张恶魔

Why are we playing this game?

你到底在玩什么花样

764
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,520
Where did you get this?

765
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,641
你从哪里得来的

766
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,960
I stole it from a woman in an auction room,
but I believe it was intended for you.

767
00:26:03,842 --> 00:26:06,004
我从拍卖行一个女人那里偷来的

768
00:26:06,605 --> 00:26:08,047
但我相信它是寄给你的

769

亲爱的西姆

771
00:26:15,776 --> 00:26:17,979
记住我的脸 因为你再也见不到它了

772
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:20,301
只有付出这样的代价

773
00:26:20,382 --> 00:26:22,504
才能改变历史的进程

774
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,026
我终于找到我人生的意义

775
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,320
"Found my purpose in life."

776
00:26:24,066 --> 00:26:25,348
找到我人生的意义

777
00:26:25,468 --> 00:26:27,510
所以 我一直想问的问题是

778
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,760
So the question I've been holding
is, what purpose is Rene fulfilling?

779
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,713
芮内人生的意义是什么

780
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,280
(IN ENGLISH) Time is up.

781
00:26:33,768 --> 00:26:34,729
时间到了

782
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,080
I have other clients.

783
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,052
我还有别的客人

784
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,480
Though you may not have detected
the wisp of astrakhan fur...

尽管我猜你可能还没发现我右肩上方的

木钉上挂着一缕俄国羊毛

787

...snagged on a nail over my left shoulder...

788
00:26:47,745 --> 00:26:50,268
但是你一定不会没有闻到

789
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,760
...you couldn't have failed to notice
the overpowering aroma...

790
00:26:50,468 --> 00:26:53,471
腌鲱鱼和伏特加的味道

791
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,880
...of herring pickled in vodka...

792
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,880
...in tandem with a truly unfortunate body odor.

793
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:56,835
以及那股浓重刺鼻的体味

794
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:00,320
There's a man concealed in the rafters above us.

795
00:26:57,316 --> 00:27:00,320
我们头顶的房梁上躲着个人

796
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,080
A Cossack, renowned for their
infeasible acrobatic abilities...

797
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,764
哥萨克人 他们的运动能力举世闻名

798
00:27:03,964 --> 00:27:07,488
一样出名的还有他们夜间的刺杀活动

799
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,720
...and are notorious for moonlighting as assassins.

800
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,120
So it's safe to presume that your
next client is here to kill you.

801
00:27:07,969 --> 00:27:10,332
因此可以肯定你的下一个客人

802
00:27:10,492 --> 00:27:11,813
是来杀你的

803
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,920
Anything else? No?

804
00:27:12,334 --> 00:27:14,617

Clip wings.

809
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:32,398
然后 猛击鸟嘴

810
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,240
Now blunt his beak.

811
00:27:37,845 --> 00:27:39,086
敲碎鸟蛋

812
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,600
Crack eggs.

813
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,160
Scramble. Pinch of salt.

你居然杀死了我的新婚妻子

Did you just kill my new wife?!

Of course not!

when you just threw her off a train?

- It's clear that your brother loves you.

他绝对不会寄一些会对你不利的邮件

1472
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:04,840
He'd never send you a message that
would put you in harm's way.

1473
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,720
Any information, therefore, would
be, by default, unintentional.

- And it's the same stock as the letter.
- Mm.

闻起来有霉味

1488
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,240
Must have been stored somewhere cold and damp.

1489

一定是存放在阴冷潮湿的地方

...but they spared every expense on the tea.

Now shall we compare moods,
or consider what we know?

现在我们是继续抱怨还是先理清思路

1801
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,720
Last night's bombing was clearly meant...

1802
01:11:08,288 --> 01:11:10,050
昨天的爆炸显然想让人以为是

1803
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:12,800
...to look like Germany's retaliation for Strasbourg.

德国对斯特拉斯堡事件的报复

01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:16,640
However, the bomb was also meant to
conceal the murder of just one man.

1806
01:11:13,334 --> 01:11:17,179
但真正目的是
掩饰一起针对个人的谋杀案

1807
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:21,320
The man killed by the gunshot was
none other than Alfred Meinhard.

1808
01:11:17,539 --> 01:11:21,985
被枪杀的男人就是阿尔弗雷德-迈哈德

他是军火商 重型军火

Only days ago, a large share of his company
was bought by an unknown investor.

01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:56,320
Me too.

2280
01:35:55,333 --> 01:35:56,134
我也是

2281
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:05,160
- I think we should go home.
- I concur.

2282
01:36:03,463 --> 01:36:04,384
我们该回家了

2283
01:36:04,504 --> 01:36:05,505
我同意

2284
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:07,920
We're going home.

2285
01:36:06,987 --> 01:36:07,828
我们回家吧

2286
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:16,120
Via Switzerland.

2287
01:36:14,436 --> 01:36:16,479
顺路去趟瑞士

2288
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:22,480
What better place to start a war than a peace summit?

2289
01:36:18,481 --> 01:36:20,684
想挑起战争的最佳地点

2290
01:36:21,605 --> 01:36:22,766
就是和平峰会

2291
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:28,880
We'll drop in and see my brother.
I'm sure he's missed you. Hm?

2292
01:36:23,687 --> 01:36:27,211
我们正好去看我哥哥 他一定很想你

2293
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:47,840
I don't understand why you don't cancel the summit.

2294
01:36:45,754 --> 01:36:48,157
我还是不理解你为何不取消这次峰会

2295
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,400
Fact is it's gonna happen whether we like it or not.

2296
01:36:48,237 --> 01:36:50,720
事实是无论我们怎么想它都会召开

2297
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:52,680
Everyone has already arrived.

2298
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,082
所有政要都到齐了

2299
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:55,040
Although these gentlemen may be talking peace...

2300
01:36:53,243 --> 01:36:55,285
这些先生们或许在谈和平

2301
01:36:55,240 --> 01:36:57,640
...believe me, they're readying their armies at home.

2302
01:36:55,525 --> 01:36:57,968
相信我 他们都做好了战争的准备

2303
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:00,240
To cancel the summit now would
be tantamount to war.

2304
01:36:58,169 --> 01:37:00,772
现在取消峰会就等于宣告战争

2305
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:03,720
- The telegram, wasn't it clear?
- We have doubled the security, sir.

2306
01:37:00,772 --> 01:37:02,013
那封电报还不够清楚吗

2307
01:37:02,133 --> 01:37:04,136
我们增加了一倍的警力 先生

2308
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:06,080
Oh, doubled security. That's comforting.

2309
01:37:04,216 --> 01:37:06,539
双倍的警力 真叫人安心

2310
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:09,160
You don't understand the delicacy of the situation.

2311
01:37:06,619 --> 01:37:09,342
你还不明白现在的情况有多微妙

2312
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:11,200
I passed the telegram on to my superiors.

2313
01:37:09,662 --> 01:37:12,306
我把电报交给了我的上级 但他们就是

2314
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:15,080
But they brought Moriarty in to advise
on the peace process in the first place.

2315
01:37:12,466 --> 01:37:15,389
一开始把莫里亚蒂拉来当和平顾问的人

2316
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:17,360
He has positioned himself brilliantly.

2317
01:37:15,710 --> 01:37:17,832
他现在的身份很有优势

2318
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:20,240
He's one of our foremost intellectuals,
a personal friend...

2319
01:37:17,992 --> 01:37:20,315
他是我国最重要的智囊 又是现任首相的

2320
01:37:20,355 --> 01:37:22,678
现任首相的私交好友 这个我们都知道

2321
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,600
Of the prime minister. Yes, we all know that.

2322
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:25,600
I believe you, but where's your evidence?

2323
01:37:22,798 --> 01:37:25,962
我相信你 但你的证据在哪里

2324
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:29,600
He's too good to leave evidence.

2325
01:37:27,083 --> 01:37:29,166
他厉害到从不留下证据

2326
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:31,080
He doesn't leave loose ends.

2327
01:37:30,087 --> 01:37:31,649
办事滴水不漏

2328

Sherly, put that down.

2332
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:39,560
What is this contraption? May I have
it? The effect is most invigorating.

2333
01:37:36,495 --> 01:37:38,257
这个装置有什么用 给我好吗

2334

吸了以后真有点兴奋

2335

That's my private and personal supply
of oxygen, and you're not to touch it.

2336
01:37:40,059 --> 01:37:43,903
那是我私人专用的氧气储备 你不要乱碰

2337
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:47,120
This argument is getting us nowhere.

2338
01:37:45,746 --> 01:37:47,548
这么讨论下去没有意义

2339

I've arranged for documents to be prepared
which allow you into the ball. Carruthers.

2346
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:02,120
Fact is, we don't really know what he's planning.

2347
01:37:59,322 --> 01:38:02,446
问题是 我们还没弄清楚他的计划

WATSON: No, it wouldn't be.

不会再用炸弹了

2350

这次不会用炸弹的

2352

那样做没有意义

2353
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:09,920
Why would he attack all the
nations only to unite them?

2354
01:38:07,452 --> 01:38:09,975
袭击所有国家 只会令他们团结

2355
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:11,480
It'll be an assassination.

2356
01:38:10,295 --> 01:38:11,897
应该会有暗杀

2357
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:14,960
By alone gunman at close range.

- I had my suspicions.

你都知道

我之前只是怀疑

2366
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:26,840
But having seen who would be
attending, I'm now certain.

2367
01:38:24,152 --> 01:38:26,795
但在看过出席名单后我就确定了

MYCROFT: Well, at least we know who to look out for.

现在起码知道该防着谁了

2370

Rene will be the evidence.

2371

芮内就是证据

2372
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:35,400
If we can find him and stop him, we
will perhaps not only save his life...

2373
01:38:32,001 --> 01:38:33,683
如果能找到他 阻止他

2374

...the French prime minister and his man.

He'll be making an anonymous donation to
the Widows and Orphans of War Fund.

2768
01:53:46,098 --> 01:53:50,263
他会把钱匿名捐给
战争遗孀和孤儿基金会

2769
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:54,440
Bishop to bishop eight. Discover check.

2770
01:53:51,465 --> 01:53:53,667
象向象八格 将军

2771
01:53:54,600 --> 01:53:57,240
And, incidentally, mate.

2772
01:53:54,789 --> 01:53:57,472
很不巧的 死棋

2773
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:04,200
I seem to have injured my shoulder. Would you mind?

2774
01:54:02,158 --> 01:54:04,160
我的肩膀好像受伤了 帮我一把好吗

2775
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:11,640
Be my pleasure.

2776
01:54:10,007 --> 01:54:11,128
非常乐意

2777
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:18,480
Once we've concluded our business here...

2778
01:54:14,913 --> 01:54:17,877
等我们这里的事情办完之后

2779
01:54:18,640 --> 01:54:21,160
...it's important you know...

2780

...I shall endeavor to find the most
creative of endings for the doctor.

2782
01:54:21,561 --> 01:54:25,486
找到最有创意的方式来了结那个医生

2783
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:30,160
And his wife.

2784
01:54:29,330 --> 01:54:30,332
和他的妻子

2785
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,920
HOLMES: His advantage, my injury.

2786
01:54:35,298 --> 01:54:37,180
他的优势是我有伤在身

2787
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:40,080
My advantage, his rage.

2788
01:54:37,620 --> 01:54:39,503
我的优势是他急火攻心

2789
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:46,320
Incoming assault feral, but experienced.

2790
01:54:42,146 --> 01:54:45,350
他的攻击很鲁莽 却也很犀利

2791
01:54:46,600 --> 01:54:49,440
Use his momentum to counter.

2792
01:54:46,951 --> 01:54:49,034
利用出拳间隙 予以反击

2793
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,760
MORIARTY: Come now.

2794
01:54:55,322 --> 01:55:00,648
别傻了 你真以为只有你会玩这一套吗

2795
01:54:57,280 --> 01:55:01,520
You really think you're the only
one who can play this game.

2796
01:55:01,569 --> 01:55:04,733
抓住手臂 攻击他的弱点

2797
01:55:01,680 --> 01:55:05,280
Trap arm. Target weakness.

2798
01:55:05,680 --> 01:55:07,520
Follow with haymaker.

2799
01:55:06,014 --> 01:55:07,536
紧接着重拳挥击

2800
01:55:07,680 --> 01:55:10,680
HOLMES: Ah. There we find the
boxing champion of Cambridge.

2801
01:55:07,696 --> 01:55:10,340
真不愧是当年剑桥的拳击冠军

2802
01:55:10,840 --> 01:55:13,200
MORIARTY: Competent, but predictable.

2803
01:55:11,060 --> 01:55:13,543
反击有效 但容易看穿

2804
01:55:15,560 --> 01:55:18,440
Now allow me to reply.

2805
01:55:15,746 --> 01:55:17,949
现在轮到我来回应了

2806
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:23,280
HOLMES: Arsenal running dry. Adjust strategy.

2807
01:55:20,231 --> 01:55:22,835
火力难以为继 要调整策略

2808
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:27,240
(GROANS)

2809
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:29,560
MORIARTY: Wound taking its loll.

2810
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:29,122
伤势的影响开始体现

2811
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:34,200
HOLMES: As I feared. Injury makes defense untenable.

2812
01:55:30,043 --> 01:55:33,808
如我担心的 肩伤让我无力防守

2813
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:43,320
Prognosis increasingly negative.

2814
01:55:39,535 --> 01:55:42,979
预期结果 会越来越糟糕

2815
01:55:47,240 --> 01:55:50,800
MORIARTY: Let's not waste any
more of one another's lime.

2816
01:55:47,504 --> 01:55:50,147
让我们别再浪费彼此的时间了

2817
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:58,600
We both know how this ends.

2818
01:55:55,994 --> 01:55:57,917
结果我们心里都清楚

2819
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:14,760
HOLMES: Conclusion, inevitable.

2820
01:56:12,975 --> 01:56:15,177
推理完毕 必死无疑

to tell the little that remains.

01:57:27,985 --> 01:57:31,309
故事的尾声无需赘述

2827
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:44,360
Any attempt at finding the bodies
was absolutely hopeless.

2828
01:57:39,358 --> 01:57:43,844
任何寻找尸体的努力都以失败而告终

2829
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:50,680
And so there...
