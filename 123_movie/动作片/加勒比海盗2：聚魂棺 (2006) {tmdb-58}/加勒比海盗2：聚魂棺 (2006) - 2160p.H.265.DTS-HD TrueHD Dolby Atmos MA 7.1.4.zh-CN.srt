这个逮捕证是伊丽莎白・斯旺的 是吗?真麻烦 是我的错

And the hurricane. Aye.

All in all, it seems some time since we did a speck of honest pirating.
总之 我们似乎有一阵没干海盗的本行啦

47
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,390
Shiny. Aye, shiny.

Is that how you're all feeling?

And whatever this key unlocks, inside there's something valuable.
不管这钥匙开的是什么锁 里面一定有值钱的东西

61

So we're setting out to find whatever this key unlocks.
所以我们要出发找到这钥匙能开的锁?

62
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,540
No.
不对

63
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:47,000
If we don't have the key, we can't open whatever we don't have that it unlocks.
没有它 不管那是什么锁 我们也打不开

64
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:50,960
So what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked,
不先搞到钥匙 找到锁又有何用?

65
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,510
which we don't have, without first having found the key what unlocks it?
且不说咱们手上还没锁！

66
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,930
So we're going after this key.
就是说…我们要找钥匙罗?

Captain?

Setting sail without knowing his own heading.

what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow bodes ill for us all.
要我说 杰克・斯派洛都不知所措 一定不是好兆头

We've had dealings in the past.

I'm afraid currency is the currency of the realm.
恐怕只有金钱才能通行无阻

271
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:28,560
I expect, then, we can come to some sort of understanding.
我想这样我们应该能达成某种共识

272
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,860
I'm here to negotiate. I'm listening.

I'm listening intently.

274
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,990
These letters of marque are signed by the king.
这些私掠许可是国王签署的

275
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,830
Yes, and they're not valid until they bear my signature and my seal.
是的 不过没有我签字盖章 它们就不生效

Or else I would not still be here.

You sent Will to get you the compass owned by Jack Sparrow.
你派威尔去找杰克・斯派洛要罗盘

278
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:56,550
It will do you no good. Do explain.
这对你不会有好处 请解释一下

279
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:01,430
I have been to the Isla de Muerta. I have seen the treasure myself.
我去过死亡之岛 我亲眼见过那些财宝

280
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,770
There is something you need to know. I see.
有些东西你需要了解 我懂了

281
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,980
You think the compass leads only to the Isla de Muerta
你以为那罗盘只是指向死亡之岛

282
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:12,230
and so you hope to save me from an evil fate.

I care not for cursed Aztec gold.

My desires are not so provincial.
我的眼光没有那么短浅

286
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:26,910
There's more than one chest of value in these waters.
在这片水域中 值钱的箱子不只一个

287
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:32,210
So perhaps you may wish to enhance your offer.
所以我认为你应该提高出价

288
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,550
Consider into your calculations that you robbed me of my wedding night.
计算的时候别忘了 你还搅了我的新婚之夜

289
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,800
So I did.

290
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:46,060
A marriage interrupted

291
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,070
or fate intervenes?
是否天意如此呢?

292
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:55,070
You're making great efforts to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom.
我们在尽力确保杰克・斯派洛的自由

293

These aren't going to Jack. Really?

294
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:00,530
To ensure Mr Turner's freedom, then,

Consider that in your calculations.

你怎么知道你的小聪明 就不是上帝保佑的结果?

Anyways, I ain't stealing no ship.
不管怎样 我再不偷别人的船了

302
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:49,070
It ain't stealing. It's salvaging. And since when did you care?
那不是偷 是救援 什么时候你开始在意这个了?

303
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:53,790
Since we're not immortal no more. We gotta take care of our immortal souls.
自从我们不再是不死之身 我们得考虑一下世俗的灵魂了

Must have seen a catfish.

这归我们啦 正巧涨潮了 大好时机啊

313
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:59,320

从某种角度来说 救援船也是救赎啊

314
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,270
There's the truth of it!

Suppose we better save it as soon as we can,

what with our souls in such a vulnerable state and all.

Why would he do this to us? If Jack is the chief...
他干嘛要这么对我们? 如果杰克是酋长的话?

320
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,790
Aye, the Pelegostos made Jack their chief,
土著们的确让杰克作了酋长

321
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,460
but he only remains chief as long as he acts like a chief.
只有酋长装得像样 他才能继续做下去

322
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:05,680
So he had no choice. He's a captive as much as the rest of us.
就是说他别无选择 他像我们其他人一样也不过是个囚犯

323
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:12,470
Worse, as it turns out. See, the Pelegostos believe that Jack is a god in human form,
事实上是更糟 土著认为杰克是附体的神灵

324
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:18,520
and they intend to do him the honour of releasing him from his fleshy prison.

Where's the rest of the crew?

This is going to save Elizabeth?

How much do you know about Davy Jones?

What's all this?
是这样的吗?

409
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,480
If you both fancy the dress, you'll just have to share and wear it one after the other.
你们都那么喜欢那件洋装的话 就轮流穿

It's not like that, sir. This ship is haunted.

00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,730
Is it, now? And you?

There's a female presence amongst us here, sir.

All the men, they can feel it.

searching for her husband, lost at sea.

And that bodes ill by all accounts.
这是厄运之兆

I say that we throw the dress overboard and we hope the spirit follows it.
我建议我们把这衣服丢下海 祈祷女鬼会跟着一起走

419
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,260
No! That will just anger the spirit, sir.
不行 那只会激怒她

What we need to do is find out what the spirit needs, and then get it back to her.
我们应搞清楚她想要什么 助她达成愿望

You're a pair of superstitious goats and it's got the best of you.
你们已经迷信到昏头了

423
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,410
Now, this appears to be no more as we have a stowaway on board.
由这看来我们船上来了一位不速之客

424
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,660
A young woman, by the look of it.

Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean?

它有着巨大的触手 一下就能把你的脸给吸下来

是它震耳欲聋的咆哮 闻到的是它腐尸般恶臭的呼吸

硬生生把他和他的爱人拆散 不会比让他们成婚还更残酷吧?

Including the previous owner of this sword, I believe.

783
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:20,340
and all manner of remorseless pieces of metal.
到时候剑拔弩张 枪炮无眼

784
01:21:20,430 --> 01:21:26,430
I find it distasteful to even contemplate the horror facing all those on board.

Shall I remove these shackles?

Do what you can for my daughter.

你看 只要价位合适 几乎任何人都可以被收买

Wondering how it's played?

I understand. Liar!
知道 开!

798
01:22:32,790 --> 01:22:38,340
It's a game of deception. But your bet includes all the dice, not just your own.
这是一场欺诈的赌博 你赌所有骰子的点数 不光是自己的

799
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:41,760
What are they wagering? The only thing we have.

Against?

I want this.
我要这个

Call me a liar, or up the bid.

And be called a liar myself for my trouble?

Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar and you will spend an eternity on this ship.
鞋带比尔 你输了 今生今世都要呆在这船上

the very next time we make port!

Fool. Why did you do that?

I couldn't let you lose.

It was always in my blood to die at sea.

838
01:29:28,540 --> 01:29:31,540
It was not a fate I ever wanted for you.

It's not a fate you had to choose for yourself, either.
你也可以不选择如此命运

我当初是不得已 才抛弃你去当海盗的

841

842

They'll know you helped me.

I take this with a promise.

Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company.

853
01:30:49,540 --> 01:30:53,250
Will was working for Beckett and never said a word.
威尔在为贝克特勋爵效劳！ 他可一个字也没提过

854
01:30:53,670 --> 01:30:57,420
Beckett wants the compass. Only one reason for that.
贝克特想要你的罗盘 目的只有一个

855
01:30:57,540 --> 01:31:00,050
Of course.

He wants the chest. Yes, he did say something about a chest.
他想得到亡灵箱 没错 他的确提到过什么宝箱的

857
01:31:04,010 --> 01:31:07,600
If the company controls the chest, they controls the sea.
如果东印度公司控制了亡灵箱 就等于控制了整个大海

858
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:11,430
A truly discomfiting notion, love. And bad.
大海将面临灾难 亲爱的 还有厄运

Bad for every mother's son what calls himself a pirate.
天下每个海盗的厄运

I think there's a bit more speed to be coaxed from these sails.

Brace the foreyard!

Might I enquire as to how you came by these?

Decidedly not.

As if I could be bought for such a low price.

869
01:31:41,130 --> 01:31:43,590
Jack, the letters, give them back. No.

Persuade me.

As I said, persuade me.

It's a curious thing.

There was a time I would have wanted you to look like that while thinking about me.
我曾经愿意舍弃一切 只想换来你对我动情一笑

我不懂你的意思 我知道你懂

877
01:32:29,550 --> 01:32:31,810
So you never wondered how your latest fiance

878
01:32:31,930 --> 01:32:35,930
ended up on the Flying Dutchman in the first place?
沦落到"飞行的荷兰人"上呢?

879
01:33:00,460 --> 01:33:03,710
Strange to come upon a longboat so far out in open water.
公海上突然出现一艘救生艇

880
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:07,220

That dress. Where did you get it?

It was found aboard the ship.

胡说八道 是啊 一派胡言

886

它可给我们带来了好运 幽灵告诉我们"去龟岛"

887
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:36,080
and we made a nice bit of profit there.
我们在那里挣了一大笔钱

888

Off the books, of course.

I imagine some of your crew may have jumped ship there.
我猜你们船员中有人在龟岛离船了

你为什么这么问? 船长！一艘船向我们驶来

You will watch this.

Let no joyful voice be heard!

I've doomed us all.

Mother Carey's chickens! What happened?

But if you go and brave the weird and haunted shores at world's end,
如果想去奇异而又充满牛鬼蛇神的天涯海角

1208
02:20:33,630 --> 02:20:39,910
then you will need a captain who knows those waters.
你们就需要一位称职的船长

1209
02:20:54,810 --> 02:20:58,980
So tell me, what's become of my ship?
