对不起  请让条路
Excuse me  Make way

3
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,950
我的天
Jesus Christ

4
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,080
李氏餐馆
Li's Diner

5
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:08,930
这里有4个伤员，需要两辆救护车
There are four down, need two MS vehicles

6
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:10,920
这是什么情况？
What the hell happen here?

7
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:11,830
出车祸了？
A mobile ran them over?

8
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,860
没呢
No, man

9
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:13,970
刚刚这伙人打了一架
It's a fight

10
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,910
其中一个家伙瞬间就把其他人打趴了
One guy took them all out like seconds

11
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,110
那家伙还坐在里面呢
He's still in there

12
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,980
就是他
That's him

13
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,860
先生，转过身来
Turn around, Mr

14
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,100
把你的手放在我看得见的地方
See your hands

15
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,100
动作慢点
Slowly

16
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,120
过期的军队身份证
Military identity card  Expired

17
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,910
38美元
$38

18
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,930
还有一把牙刷
And a toothbrush

19
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,180
没在你身上找到家庭住址
And no home address

20
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,990
换句话说，你就是无家可归咯
In other words, homeless

21
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,050
你知道打人在这个州是二级重罪吧？你叫什么来着
Are you aware that assault is a second degree felony in this state, Mr

22
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,160
姓雷彻，名杰克，没有中名
Reacher  First name Jack  No middle name

23
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,980
如果那些被你揍的人出庭作证，刑期可延长至20年
It will extend to 20 years, once the boys you beat out there fit the testify

24
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,920
我们把他带到县监狱去吧
Process him  Get him to county

25
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,910
90秒内将会发生两件事
Two things that will happen in the next 90 seconds

26
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,900
你说什么？
Excuse me?

27
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,160
第一件事
First,

28
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,070
那边的那台电话将会响起
That phone there is gonna ring

29
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,080
第二件事
Second,

30
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,180
你会戴着这几副手铐，被押往监狱
You're going to be wearing these handcuffs on your way to prison

31
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,160
这个预言可真有意思，雷彻先生
That's one magnificent prophesy, Mr  Reacher

32
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:49,140
打电话的是宪兵110部队犯罪调查部的特纳少校
That is Major Turner of the 110th CID Military Police in Alexandria, Virginia

33
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:52,050
你们和那些被揍的家伙在进行些非法勾当
You and those boys out there made a mistake,

34
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,970
非法使用归属于美国军方的土地
Operating a land owned by the US army

35
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,090
你在胡说八道什么？
What are you talking about?

36
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,010
绑架非法移民
Kidnapping illegals

37
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,100

宪兵马上就到

39
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,190
如果把你们交给我处置，我绝对一枪崩了你
If it were up to me, I just kill you

40
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,060
电话会响到你接了它为止
She is gonna keep on ringing

41
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,150
我是警长，雷蒙 伍德
Sherif Raymond Wood

42
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,020
你究竟是谁？
Who the hell are you?

43
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,190
我是那些你不关注人中的一员
The guy you didn't count on

44
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,150
谢谢
Thank you

45
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:34,050
这里是宪兵110部队，我是李奇军士
United States army 110th, Sergeant Leach

46
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,120
请帮我转接特纳少校
Major Turner, please

47
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,130
请稍候
One moment please

48
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,160
我是特纳
This is Turner

49
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,100
是苏珊 特纳少校么？
Major S Turner?

50
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,310
正是，你是哪位
This is she  Whom I speaking to?

51
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,280
我是杰克 雷彻
It's Jack Reacher

52
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,110
哟，可算是等到你了
No kidding

53
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,150
很高兴我们终于能说上话了
Well it's nice finally speak

54
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,130
感觉你向我们检举揭发那个警长
Thanks for tipping to us that sheriff

55
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,070
其实，我
You know, I

56
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,160
实际上我想感谢你对我的帮助
I want to thank you for helping me

57
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,040
我当时情况可不太妙
I'm in tied spot

58
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,200
少校先生，互相帮助是应该的嘛
Isn't that what we focus to do for each other, Major?

59
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,230
我是前少校
Ex Major

60
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,260
不要在意这些细节，一日为少校，终身为少校嘛
Oh, once a Major always a Major

61
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,260
你现在在哪呢
Where are you calling from?

62
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,060
嗯，这个很难说
I said independence, I think

63
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,190
你自己都不知道你在哪？
You're not sure?

64
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,330
这不重要，我经常换地方住的
It does not really matter, I move around a lot

65
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,140
我听说是这样
So I've heard

66
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,200
关于我你还听说过什么
What else have you heard?

67
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,270
我听说的东西可不少呢，你在我们这算的上一个传奇了
Oh, come on, you're a legend around here

68
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,150
很多我手下的人还在想你怎么突然就不干了
Some folks wonder why you left

69
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,150
我这么说吧
Let's just say I

70
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,100
因为我一早起来，发现这制服尺码不太对，就不想干了
woke up one morning and the uniform didn't fit

71
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,170
宪兵110部，我是李奇军士
US army 110th, Sergeant Leach

72
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,100
杰克 雷彻呼叫少校特纳
Jack Reacher for Major Turner

73
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,080
请稍后
Hold on, Major

74
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,310
雷彻
Reacher

75
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,350
我的办公室如何
How's my office?

76
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,320
我正坐在你的办公室里呢
I'm sitting here now

77
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:51,090
你桌子上有个凹痕
There's this big dent in the desk

78
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,130
听说这是你某人的头按在了桌子上弄出来的
And people say you made it with someone's head

79
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,160
是真的么？
Is that true?

80
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,340
这点小事，何足挂齿
Not my finest hour

81
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,110
你不会又给自己招惹了什么麻烦吧？
You're not in trouble again, are you?

82
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,370
我知道哪怕麻烦不找上你的门
I'm afraid you have a way of finding it

83
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,220
你
Or

84
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,230
还是会给自己制造麻烦的
Looking for it

85
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,290
我觉得，你帮了我那么多，我应该请你吃个饭
You know, I was thinking maybe I owe you dinner for what you did

86
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,330
是么，吃完饭再感激我也不迟
Oh, dinner will take you a while to come to that conclusion

87
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,380
你什么时候来华盛顿？
When are you coming to DC?

88
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,250
我在去的路上
I'll get there eventually

89
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,120
真是很期待啊
Then I'll hold my breath

90
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,360
你怎么不说话了
You are not saying anything

91
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,390
我在想要是见到了你本人，我还会喜欢你么
I am deciding whether I'd like you in person

92
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,200
你喜欢哪种人？
Which way are you leaning

93
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,140
还没想好
On the fence

94
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,200
我可不觉得你能驾驭我
I'm not sure you can handle me

95
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,350
我并不担心这个问题
Oh, I'm not worried

96
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:40,150
是么
Hmm, worry

97
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,160
我觉得你多少应该有点担心的
Just a little

98
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,130
保重，雷彻
Take care of yourself, Reacher

99
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,300
我是杰克 雷彻，来找特纳少校
Jack Reacher for Major Turner

100
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,330
雷彻少校

101
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,370
我是李奇军士，我们还通过话呢
Sergeant Leach, we spoke on the phone

102
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,180
欢迎你回来
Welcome back

103
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,380
叫我雷彻就好
Just Reacher

104
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,290
我现在没有军职
I'm a civilian now

105
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,380
是，先生
Yes, Sir

106
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,260
我带你过去
I'll take you out

107
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,470
很抱歉，我
Oh, I'm sorry, I was

108
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,410
进来，少校
Come in, Major

109
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,340
我是山姆 摩根

00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,280
请进
Please come in  Come in

请坐
Have a sit

112
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,360
听说了不少你的事迹啊
Heard a lot about you

113
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,230
我只是顺道来拜访一下特纳 少校的
Just stopping by to see Major Turner

114
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,470
是么，恐怕你见不到她了
Oh, well, that's a problem

115
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,370
特纳少校已经被解职了
Major Turner has been relieved for command

116
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,450
我前几天才跟她通过话呢
I spoke with her a few days ago

117
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,450
她已经被逮捕了
She has been arrested

118
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,180
过几天在军事法庭受审
Court martials are pending

119
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,260
她受到了什么指控？
On what charge?

120
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,240
间谍罪
Espionage

121
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,210
在新的人选派过来之前，我暂时接替她的职务
I am assuming her duty until a replacement is assigned

122
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,440
还有什么我能帮你的么
Some I can help you with?

123
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,280
没事了，这只是一次个人访问
No  Just personal visit

124
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,290
你们以前就认识么
You know each other from back your old here?

125
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,420
不，我从没见过她
No  Never met her

126
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,290
少校，很抱歉把这个坏消息告诉你
Sorry to give you the bad news, Major

127
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,370
前少校
Ex Major

128
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,380
先生，我本想警告你一些事
Sir, I wanted to warn you

129
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,350
但是？
But?

130
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,340
被命令什么都不能说
Ordered not to

131
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,320
摩根上校直接给我的命令
Colonel Morgan directly

132
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,450
我觉得你还是告诉我一下为好
Maybe you should warn me now

133
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,460
军士，别顾虑太多
Speak freely, Sergeant

134
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,440
先生，特纳上校是一个好人
Major Turner is an excellent officer, sir

135
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:37,240
军方给她指派了律师么
Has she be assigned an attorney yet?

136
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,440
抱歉，无可奉告，先生
Ordered not to give out any information about that, sir

137
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,390
明白了
Understood

138
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,330
军士，好好遵守命令吧
Always follow orders, Sergeant

139
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,380
是，先生
Sir

140
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:49,230
我很好奇，你新兵营里的教官是哪位？
Just curious, who is your DI in boot camp?

141
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,240
格林军士
Sergeant Green, sir

142
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,270
打个比方，格林军士现在遇到了一些法律上的麻烦
Let's say, Sergeant Green are having legal troubles

143
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,480
要你给他推荐一位律师，你能做到么
Would you be able to recommend an attorney for him?

144
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,390
嗯
Oh

145
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,320
可以
Yes

146
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:08,260
我会推荐默克罗夫特上校，请他去戴尔堡的最高军事监狱，他是你能找到的最好的律师了
Definitely I recommend Colonel Moorcroft over Fort Dyer with the highest security prison you can find, sir

147
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,450
上校
Colonel

148
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:20,550
你是被指派为苏珊 特纳少校的律师吧？
You're the assigned council for Major Susan Turner

149
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,490
我是杰克 雷彻
I'm Jack Reacher

150
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,360
前110部队的指挥官
Former Commander of 110th

151
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,370
我还在想你什么时候会来找我呢
I was wondering when you are gonna show up

152
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:33,370
特纳少校要求任何情况下都不能让你见她
Major Turner requested under no circumstances you'd be granted visitation approaches

153
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,440
她为什么会提这种要求
Why would she say that?

154
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,380
也许是因为她读了你的个人档案吧
Maybe she read your file

155
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:41,420
反政府，反社会
我还反律师呢   还是个不负责任的父亲？
Anti authority, anti social
Anti lawyer   *** Dad?

156
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,490
你说什么？
Excuse me?

157
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,560
档案说你从来不肯付赡养费
says you never pay child support

158
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,270
我从未有过儿女
I'm not a father

159
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:50,510
有一个叫坎迪丝 达顿的女士可不这么认为
Well, a woman named Candice Darton says the differ

160
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,550
她联系军方，为她的女儿索要赔偿金
She contacted the army seeking compensation for her daughter

161
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,490
萨曼莎 达顿，现年15岁
Samantha Darton, she is 15 now

162
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,330
这肯定是个误会
It's a mistake

163
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,530
通常来说是这样
They usually are

164
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:05,440
母亲有犯罪前科，卖淫和盗窃
Mothers got two priors, prostitution and possession

165
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,440
这个孩子的童年都是在抚育院里度过的
The kid is in the net of foster care for whole life

166
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,550
你对此感觉如何？
Any feelings about that?

167
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,330
你问我对她在抚育院长大的看法么？
About foster care?

168
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,350
生活总是有诸多不顺的
Life sucks

169
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,370
我的意思是，你打算拿你的孩子怎么办？
I mean, the kid

170
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,600
她不是我的女儿，我从没听说过这个叫坎迪丝 达顿的女人
I never kid  I've never heard of Candice Darton

171
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,440
我来这是问你关于少校特纳的事的
I'm here about Major Turner

172
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,380
他们手上有什么证据
What evidence do they have?

173
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,470
一个硬盘
A hard drive

174
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,350
在她的住所搜到的，内含机密信息
Contained classified information found on Major Turner's residence

175
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,450
说明她正在贩卖国家机密
The inference she is selling secrets

176
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,630
就这些？
And that's it?

177
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,540
你还想要什么证据？要不要再来几张她穿着奇装异服跟塔利班成员一起吃饭的合照？
What do you want? Pictures of wearing *** or drinking with the Taliban?

178
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,470
她跟你说了些什么
What did she tell you?

179
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,600
明天之前我什么都不能说
Can't talk them until tomorrow

180
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,450
除非涉及公共安全
Public safety exception

181
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,450
真是个墨守成规的人
And you accept that?

182
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,560
你的法律学位在哪拿的？
Where did you get your law degree?

183
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,520
呵呵
Oh

184
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:57,380
上校，你可能以前是个好律师
It's possible you are once a good lawyer, Colonel

185
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,420
但现在就我看来，你只不过是一个要退休的蠢蛋，因为怕丢掉自己的养老金就畏缩不前
But what I see     is a retired fool who will do anything not to endanger his pension

186
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,590
如果你搞清楚了自己的制服所承载的责任，请告知我
Let me know when you remember what that uniform stands for

187
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,410
谢谢
Thank you

188
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,440
我们还要在这盯多久，我都饿死了
How long are we supposed to do this? I am getting hungry

189
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,700
耐心等就行了
Just be patient

190
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,510
你觉得他在吃什么
What do you think he is eating?

191
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,710
闭嘴
Shut up

192
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,410
这是你的新枪？
New gun?

193
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,410
对
Yep

194
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,520
看起来不错啊
That's nice

195
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,650
跟你的大手很配
Makes your hand look big

196
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,690
你喜欢用大枪？
Do you like big gun?

197
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,560
用这枪射击
Once in your face

198
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,530
那才叫真的爽呢
in the minute you carry on

199
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,470
他人怎么不见了
Where did he go?

200
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,560
不知道，也许是去买披萨了吧
I do not know, maybe went to pizza

201
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,670
你不是应该盯着他的么
You're supposed to be watching him

202
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,650
你是不是觉得我能眼观六路来着？
Do you think I have eyes in the back of the head?

203
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,590
近来如何？
How's it going?

204
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,650
别动
Do not!

205
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,690
把枪拿出来
Show me

206
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,470
丢到后面去
Throw back

207
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,520
我不喜欢有人跟踪我
I do not like being followed

208
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,610
我不喜欢有人跟踪我
I do not like being followed

209
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,630
一次是在人行道上
On the sidewalk before

210
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,610
一次是在市场里
And in the market

211
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,550
你就是个小偷
Your little thief

212
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,580
你是警察？
You're a cop?

213
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,710
我看起来像警察么
I look like a cop?

214
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,660
也许是便衣吧
** maybe

215
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,830
眼力可以啊
You know I'm the ***

216
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,700
从你的发型看出来的
It's haircut

217
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,640
多谢夸奖
thanks

218
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,610
我自己理的呢
I do it myself

219
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,610
估计你想做一些不正经的事吧
You're looking for something weird

220
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,610
再见吧
See you

221
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:54,790
你是坎迪斯 达顿的女儿吧？
Are you Candice Darton's daughter?

222
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,790
你想表达什么？
What did you do this time?

223
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,850
没事
Nothing

224
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,590
我只是她的一个老朋友
An old friend

225
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,620
是么
Yeah?

226
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:02,610
我跟你说，她已经不干那一行了
Well, she does not do that kind of thing anymore

227
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,680
我不是那个意思
That is not what I mean

228
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,840
如果你要找我妈妈，我已经不跟她一起住了
If you're looking for my mom, I do not live with her

229
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,720
你和谁一起住？
Who do you live with?

230
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,840
你说得对，少校
You're right, Major

231
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,650
我是要退休了
I am tired

232
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,810
但我并不笨
But I'm not stupid

233
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,690
米尔科维奇和齐蓓丽军士
Sergeant Mirkovich and Cibelli

234
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:37,870
两周前，特纳少校派他们去阿富汗开展一次调查
2 weeks ago, Major Turner dispatched them in Afghanistan in an outside investigation

235
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,870
他们每天都向少校递交报告
And they file reports daily

236
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:43,680
两天前，他们被人杀死在巴格拉姆军事基地
2 days ago, they were both found dead in the Bagramair base

237
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,740
凶手近距离射击
Shot in close range

238
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,860
第二天，特纳少校就被逮捕，送往监狱了
The next day Major Turner was thrown in prison

239
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,730
你对超源公司知道多少？
What do you know about Parasource?

240
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,650
超源公司？
Parasource?

241
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,620
它是
It is

242
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,850
一个很出名的军队承包商
a big note military contractor

243
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:01,780
怎么突然提起这个？
Why?

244
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,750
我不知道他们为什么会在这个案子里掺一脚
I do not know how did they involved in all this,

245
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:06,760
但是自从我到华府以后，他们就一直在跟踪我
but they've been following me since I got here

246
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:11,770
不管是谁杀了米尔科维奇和齐蓓丽，不管是谁把特纳上校隔离起来
Whoever killed Mirkovich and Cibelli, wanted Major Turner isolated

247
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,830
我觉得他们正预谋杀了她
I think they are gonna kill her too

248
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,710
你在说些什么？你根本没证据证明这些事是相互关联的
What are you talking about? You have no idea if any these things are related

249
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,850
我们得把她救出来   我的当事人并不希望你卷进这桩案件
We need to get her out    And my *** she does not want you involved

250
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,690
按我说的做就行了，我今晚给你打电话
Do it now  I'll call you tonight

人们在质疑提高审问技巧的价值
People questioned the value of enhanced interrogation techniques

253
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:13,940
提高审问技巧并没有什么用，但是严刑拷打确实挺管用的
Enhanced interrogation techniques don't work, but torture on the other hand, works very well

254
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,720
不
No

律师 委托人特免权可以追溯到英国习惯法刚出台的时期
Attorney client privilege goes back to the earliest days of English Common Law

256
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,830
这就意味着，特纳少校告诉了你不少保密信息
It means, Major Turner told you in confidence

257
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:30,790
其中包括她在阿富汗的调查结果

你给杰克 雷彻泄露了多少消息？
How much did you tell Jack Reacher?

259
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,830
不
No

260
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,770
我什么都没说
I did not talk about

261
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,880
当然你什么都不应该说

不

我们只谈了10分钟
We talked about 10 minutes

264
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,830
10分钟可是一段很长的时间
10 minutes is a very long time

265
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,850
你马上就明白这一点了
As you are about to learn

266
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,030
不      说！
No      Say!

00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,930
说！

Jack Reacher? Colonel Morgan wants to know if you have a few minutes

270
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,980
你是不是不记得我了？

我在这个职位上待了挺久了
Well, you will still see when I got here

273
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:19,740
你半年没通过我的提职申请
You held back my promotion for 6 months

274
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,010
是么，我都不记得了
Why would I do that?

275
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,560
因为你觉得我做决定时经常过于草率
Because you are *** to say I jump to conclusions

276
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,440
应该是我当时做事也太草率了吧
I'm sure I jump to conclusions

00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:51,900
昨天，你有尝试联系过特纳少校么
*** yesterday, did you try to contact Major Turner?

281
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:58,010
昨天晚上11点你去戴尔堡见过律师默克罗夫特上校么？
Did you confront attorney Col  Moorcroft at Fort Dyer at 1100?

282
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,020
你跟我说我什么都不用说
You told me not to say anything

283
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,980
我的意思是没人逼你说话，但你要回答我的问题
I said you didn't have to say anything

284
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,840
对
Yes

285
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,940
所以你确实见过他了？
Yes, you confronted him?

286
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,940
对，我知道我自己什么都不用说
Yes I understand I do not have to say anything

287
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:19,010
根据记录，你昨天见过默克罗夫特上校
For the record, you did confront Colonel Moorcroft yesterday

288
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:23,900
你能告诉我今天凌晨1：30 5：00之间你在哪么
Can you state your whereabouts last night at 01:30 and 05:00?

289
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,900
对
Yes

290
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,990
你倒是说啊
Yes, what?

291
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,060
对，我知道我自己什么都不用说
Yes I understand I do not have to say anything

292
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:37,920
少校昨天会面时把手弄伤了这一点可没有记录在案啊
Not for the record the Major has an injury to his hands at present during yesterday's meeting

293
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,960
真无聊，我走了
We're done here

294
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:48,100
大约在今天凌晨2：30，阿奇博尔德 默克罗夫特上校被人殴打致死
At approximately 2:30 this morning Colonel Archibald Moorcroft was beaten to death

295
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,940
你是我的律师咯？
You're my attorney?

296
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,100
我是莎莉文中尉
Lt  Sullivan

297
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:00,090
你好   你被指控谋杀律师
How do you do?   You are hereby charged with the murder of a judge *** general

298
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,070
他是在哪被杀的？   在他的公寓里
Where was he killed?   In his apartment

299
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,980
基地的公寓？   是的
Of base?   Yes

300
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,880
这是一起民事案件
This is an civilian matter

301
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,910
我只是一位平民，军队对我没有管辖权，把我交给华盛顿警方
As a private citizen the army has no jurisdiction, turn me over to the DC police

302
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,980
你应该知道10 75号军队条例是什么吧
You're familiar with article 10 75 of the military code?

303
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,070
在紧急时期，像你一样高安全级别的军官必须服从军队的召回
An officer with your security clearance remains subject to recall in an event of emergency

304
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:23,080
你离职的时候可是签字同意了的
You agree to when you sign your discharge

305
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,940
欢迎回到军队，少校
Welcome back to the army, Major

306
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,960
你现在被逮捕了

请求转移犯人

312
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,920

313
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,190
再检查一下
Go over whatever evidence they have on you

314
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,030
你什么证据都看不到的
There won't be any evidence

315
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,140
你说什么?
What are you talking about?

316
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:54,940
他们杀了两个调查员，又杀了一个律师
They killed investigators and they killed a lawyer

317
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:58,150
证据表明你杀了特纳少校的律师   那不是我干的
Evidence suggests you kill Major Turner's lawyer    I did not kill hers

318
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,060
他们肯定打算杀掉我，就我所见，你也在所难逃
They are going to kill me, for I know, you're a part of it

319
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,000
听着，你这个呆瓜，你才是被指控谋杀的那个人
Listen, dickhead  You're the one accused of murder

320
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,230
你最好把证明自己无罪的证据告诉我
Wanted to show me your thread of evidence?

321
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,010
只有这样我才能帮你，要不然就滚吧
Then I can talk for you, otherwise go to hell

322
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,210
抱歉，我有点低血糖
Apologize, I have low blood sugar

323
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,150
你说什么？
Excuse me?

324
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,020
我今天早上没吃饭
I didn't eat this morning

325
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,150
感觉有点头晕
Felt light headed

326
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:19,160
能不能帮我去办公室找点吃的，小姐？三明治就好
Could you get me something from the office, miss? Sandwich maybe

327
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,070
轻打开门

328
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,130

打开BA201门

331
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,240
他们是谁
Who are they?

332
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:04,030
我问你话呢，他们是谁
I ask you the question, who are they?

333
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,260
你说不说话？
Are you going to answer me?

334
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,210
雷彻？这是什么情况？
Reacher? What is this?

335
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,080
不许动
Hold!

336
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,050
这些人是来杀你的   你说什么？
These man are here to kill you    What?

337
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,150
他们杀了默克罗夫特
They killed Moorcroft

338
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,160
等等，你说什么？   昨天晚上，他死在了自己的公寓里
Wait, what?   Last night, in his apartment

339
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,220
现在他们要对你下手了
And now they are gonna kill you

340
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,330
士兵，你知道我是谁么？我要你解除戒备
Soldiers, you know who I am? I need you to stand down

341
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,110
女士，你的指挥权已经被解除了   没时间可以浪费了
You've relieved for command madam    No time

342
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:34,180
我无故被关在这里，你必须告诉我
I've been held without cause, it is your right to tell

343
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,320
这个士兵是我的人
The soldier is under my command

344
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,160
我们没时间可以浪费了
We don't have time for this

345
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,260
拿上他的军衔和文书
Get his badge and papers

346
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,110
我下达过明确的命令，让你别来浑水
I left explicit orders for you to stay away

347
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,210
命令？你居然敢命令我？   对，我就知道你会做这样的蠢事
Orders? You ordered me?   Yes, I knew you will do something like this

348
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:54,090
我希望你会后悔你当初的决定
I hope you will regret it

349
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:57,130
埃斯平，你把他怎么了？
Espin? What did you do to him?

350
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,240
他没事
He will be fine

351
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:04,330
这真是太疯狂了   你是说我们的晚餐泡汤了么
This is insame    This mean the dinner is off?

352
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,260
假装出生气的样子   不用假装，我现在确实很生气
Act angry      I'm angry,

355
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:23,400
等会       让开！
Hey wait a second      Move!

356
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:30,220
他的钥匙，把他的钥匙给我
His keys, give me his keys

357
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:35,400
我的律师大概会配发到哪种车？   大概是黑色的小轿车吧
What kind of car would my lawyer be driving?   A black sedan

358
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,210
妈的
Damn

359
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:48,350
快！

360

围住这片区域 围住服务区
Secure the perimeter    Secure the service block

361
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,310
速度快点！   跟上！
Move! Move! Move!   Let's go!

362
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,280
我们得利用下那辆送餐车
Food truck

363
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:01,180
快！
Move in!

364
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,260
没人！
Clear

365
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,330
他们躲进送餐车里了！追上那辆卡车！快！
They were in the food truck! Stop that truck! Go! Go! Go!

366
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,410
快！
Go! Go!   Fast!

367
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:38,490
把他们抓住！
Get them out that truck!

368
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,390
现在情况如何？
Status?

369
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,360
车里没人！
Clear!

370
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,340
所以现在我是一位逃犯了
So now I'm a fugitive from justice

371
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,470
还是一位叛国者，别忘了
A traitor to your country, do not forget that

372
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:53,450
我怎么觉得你很喜欢这种感觉呢
Why do I feel like you're enjoying this?

373
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:56,440
你表达感谢的方式真是不同寻常啊
You have a very interesting way of saying thank you

374
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,390
那些人真的会杀了我么

375
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,300
谢谢
Thank you

376
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,410
一群废物
Nice job

377
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,250
我们有一辆警车被抢了，L67号
One of our vehicles has been hijacked L67

378
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:18,220
所有单位注意，嫌疑人正驾驶着宪兵车辆L67号
All units, suspects are driving MP vehicle L67

Secondary is Major Susan Turner, female wearing military fatigues, white, age 34

381
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,410
你这么年轻？   闭嘴
Really?   Shut up

382
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,250
我们得把这车丢了，我得想办法进我的邮箱
We need to ditch this car and get into my email

383
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,230
大家打起精神来，他们到底去哪了
Let's go  Where the hell are they?

384
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,260
技术专家，打回来了么？
Spealists, have the *** call back yet?

385
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,460
正在呢，长官   华盛顿警方那边有消息了么
On it, Sir    Well, is there anybody heard the word from the capital police?

386
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,420
什么消息都可以
Anyone? Anything? A location or something?

387
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,300
附近有网咖么
Are there any internet cafes around here?

388
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:03,510
宾夕法尼亚北街有一家   那带我们过去吧
Pensylvania north street    Take us there, please

389
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:16,440
我真应该自己去阿富汗的
Should have gone Afganistan myself

390
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,540
米尔科维奇和齐蓓丽的死是我的错
Mirkovich and Cibelli were my responsibility

391
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:24,320
那不是你的错
Your job is about giving orders

392
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:27,390
在你的任期里，你手下有人牺牲么
Have you lost anyone in your watch, Reacher?

393
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:32,370
如果是在和塔利班作战时英勇牺牲，那无可厚非
My men were killed by the Taliban

394
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:38,310
但这两位是死在我们自己人手上
They were shot in the back of their head, with army issued 9mm

395
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,450
被人用军方派发的9毫米手枪，从背后射中头部致死
By one of our own

396
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,420
我一定要查明究竟是谁干的
I'll find out who did it

397
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:46,460
你手下的人在那边调查什么？
What are you guys doing over there? What are they looking for?

398
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,360
他们在调查一批武器的下落
Weapons

399
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:51,460
几批武器在战后废弃了
Dozens of weapons decommisioned during the war

400
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,570
希望它们就这么消失好了
Hopely it's gone missing

401
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:02,510
嘿，我觉得你的帽子不错
Hey, I like your hat

402
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:06,400
你也是  的粉丝么？   是啊，一直都是
U nets fan?   Yeah, from the beginning

403
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,440
我的调查员死后一天，他们就把我逮捕了
They arrested me the day after my investigators were killed

404
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,530
我的推测是，因为时差，他们应该已经把报告发到我邮箱了
Because of the time difference, they might file another report

405
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:18,420
他们把我关起来，就是不让我看到那封邮件
They locked me up so I won't see it

406
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,550
长官，她正尝试访问我们的系统
Sir, she is trying to access the system

407
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,520
把她的位置告诉我   是，长官
Give me the location    Yes, Sir

408
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,370
宾夕法尼亚北街
Pensylvania north street

409
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:33,550
我是摩根，准备行动吧
It's Morgan, ready to go to work, soldier?

410
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,610
我们已经确认他们的位置了
We've located them

411
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:38,430
他们在宾夕法尼亚北街的网咖
In an internet cafe Pennsylvania north street

412
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,370
干掉他们
Get it done

413
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:45,430
肯定是米尔科维奇和齐蓓丽在那边发现了什么导致他们遇害
Whatever Markovich and Cibelli found out got them killed

414
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,640
但是究竟是谁干的呢？
But by who?

415
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:50,590
[拒绝访问]妈的，我进不了系统
[ACCESS DENIED] Shit, they lock me out

416
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:12,390
他们可以定位我们的位置   我知道，再让我试试，可以么？
They can locate us    I know, just give me a second, ok?

417
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:17,390
他们肯定已经知道我们的位置了   让我再试试
They will know this location    Try this one    Shit

418
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:20,570
在公园的那边有一个公交车站
There is a bus stop on the other side of the park

419
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,720
有人跟踪我们，不是警察
We are being followed  It isn't cop

420
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,590
那是个职业杀手
He's a pro

421
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,690
在哪？
Where?

422
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,660
50码开外
50 yards

423
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,500
穿着黑色大衣，棕色头发
Black coat, brown hair

424
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,670
就在那边
There

425
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,540
现在去站台上等车就是送死
They meet us   Maybe

426
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:17,590
先去餐馆里躲躲
Restaurant

427
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,660
你好   我要到后面见个人
Hello    Meeting someone in the back

428
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,580
所有人都出去！
Everybody out!

429
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:43,530
快出去！
Out! move!   Out!

430
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,570
快点！
Come on, come on!

431
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:54,710
我守住这个门
I got this door

432
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,520
退后
Stay back

433
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,640
警察！不许动！
Police! Freeze!

434
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:22,710
放下武器！
Drop your weapon!

435
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,680
先生，我命令你放下武器！   我是宪兵
Sir, I said drop your weapon!   I'm military police!

436
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:29,730
他不是警察
He's not a cop

437
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,790
先生，放下你的武器
Sir, drop your weapon

438
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:35,640
我是宪兵   先生，我要你现在放下武器
I'm military police    Sir, I need you to drop your weapon

439
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,610
听着，转过身去，让我看到你的手
Listen, turn around and let me see your hand

440
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,620
好，我把我的武器放下了
I know, I am putting my weapon down

441
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:44,620
听我说，我是宪兵，他们是美国军方的两位逃犯
Listen to me, I am military police, these two are fugitives of the United States Army

442
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:47,830
先生，把你的手背到头后面   我已经转过身去了
Sir, get your hands behind your head    I am turning around

443
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:50,630
把你的手背到头后面
Place your hands behind your head

444
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,880
快点   我的右边口袋里有我的身份证，你可以来检查一下
Now    You can check my ID card in my right front pocket, will you just check it

445
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,750
检查一下你就明白了
Just check

446
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,850
快，让开
Go, move move move

447
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,740
我们两个人都没打过他
They got our signals crossed

448
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:43,830
这家伙身手不错
He's good

449
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,770
我们下次肯定能搞定他
We will get him next time

450
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,920
我承认我现在有点嫉妒正常人的生活了
Now I admit being a little jealous when we talk

451
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:59,860
想去哪就去哪，想吃啥就吃啥
Go where you want, eat when you want

452
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,770
不会有人命令你去做什么，或者告诉你要怎么做
Nobody tell you what to do or how to do it

453
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,870
军队里肯定是不可能如此自由的
It is definitely not the army way

454
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,780
没错
Exactly

455
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,730
看看那几张身份卡
Just take a look at the registration

456
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:23,830
超源公司，你觉得在厨房跟我们交手的那位是他们的人？
Parasource  You think that guy in the kitchen was one of theirs?

457
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,720
我猜他可能是自由杀手吧，偶尔出来接活
Freelance, it is my guess

458
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:55,760
说
Go

459
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:57,860
听说你闹的乱子不小啊
Made a mess, I hear

460
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,720
这家伙有点意思啊
This Reacher guy is interesting

461
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:06,850
这家伙军功章无数，不要把这次行动当成你的私人恩怨
You have no ideas they ran out of medals, so do not make this a competition

462
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:10,740
你这话说的太晚了   你确定你能自己搞定他么
Too late    Are you sure you can handle them by yourself?

463
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:12,740
我能搞定他
I can handle him just fine

464
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,800
那就证明你自己说的话
Prove it

465
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,940
咖啡   带泡沫的么？
Coffee    Cream?

466
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:32,970
不
No

467
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,790
尺码很合适啊
Right sizes

468
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:46,970
眼力不错
Good eyes

469
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,000
我们的现金用完了
Spent the rest of our cash

470
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:54,790
是时候停止逃亡，开始干活了
It's time we stop running and start hunting

471
00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:00,760
我是摩根   不知道现在打电话给你时间合适么
Morgan    Catch your bad time?

472
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,730
我希望你是要向我投案自首
I hope you're calling to turn yourself in

473
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:07,970
我知道你在外欠债不少，我向你保证我要把你的老底挖出来
But I know you owe *** money, I promise you I'll find out

474
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:09,950
你什么都发现不了的
Nobody is going to find anything

475
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,850
你以为我不知道特纳少校邮件的事？
Not even major Turner's email?

476
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,930
看到了么？   我什么都没看到
Find it yet?   Nothing to find

477
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,000
那说明你看的还不够仔细
Sheer looking is not enough

478
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,930
干嘛废这么多话，直接看我的邮件不就完了嘛
Why don't we check my field reports?

479
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:34,050
我建议你最好不要乱动，要不然骨头折了愈合时间可就长了
It's not *** break the bones, takes longer to heal

480
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,050
文件上锁了，密码交出来
Locked, need the code

481
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,040
正在查找米尔科维奇和齐蓓丽的报告
Looking for Mirkovich and Cibelli field reports

482
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,040
让我们来看看你们在那边发现了什么
Let's see what do you get there, huh?

483
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,870
你觉得你是无敌的
You think you are invulunerable

484
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,030
数据拷贝中
It will be uploading

485
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,950
我们总会想办法抓到你的，雷彻
There are ways to get you, Reacher

486
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,850
搞定了
Got it

487
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:10,080
感谢你的帮忙哦
Thanks for all your help

488
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:25,080
这是米尔科维奇和齐蓓丽交给我的最后一份报告
Okay, Mirkovich and Cibelli did file a final report

489
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:28,930
我把重点念给你听
But this    okay here we go

490
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,990
他们最后调查过的人是一个叫做丹尼尔 普东的承包商员工
Last man they spoke to was a contractor named Daniel Prudone

491
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,880
他是个武器搬运工，但是现在找不到他人了
He was a weapon transporter and he disappeared

492
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,050
我是李奇军士
This is sergeant Leech

493
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:46,020
我是格林军士，你的老教官，记得我么
This sergeant Green, your old DI, remember me?

494
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:49,060
格林军士，听到你的声音真是太好了
Sergeant Green, so good hear from you

495
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,840
我现在跟你的一位老朋友在一起，我们需要你的帮助
I'm here with a friend of you, we need a favor

496
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:57,080
有一个叫做超源公司的军队承包商，你能帮我们调查一下他们背地里在搞什么名堂么？
There is a military contractor called ParaSource, could you ask around find what role they play in the backroom?

497
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:58,950
我会尽量帮忙的
I might be able to do that

498
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,020
还有一个叫做普东的超源公司员工，我们想知道他的下落
Also there ParaSource employees named Prudone, we need to know his whereabouts

499
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,960
普东，我记下来了
Prudone, copy that

500
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
军士，一切小心   是，长官
And the sergeant, carefully    Yes, Sir

501
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,040
雷彻
Reacher

502
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:58,930
里面没人
Clear

503
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,950
雷彻
Reacher

504
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,230
放开我！
Get away from me!

505
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,040
放松，你安全了
Relaxed, it's okay

506
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,230
你不是说过你不是警察么
You said you're not a cop?

507
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,110
我确实不是警察啊
I'm not

508
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,270
你是宪兵？   这两个是不一样的
Military police?   It's different

509
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:57,050
这辆车是你们偷得吧
But you stole this car

510
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:02,190
事情很复杂，一时解释不了   你们要带我去哪
It's complicated    Where are you taking me

511
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,070
我们暂时还不清楚
We do not know yet

512
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,230
你有手机么   你说什么？
Do you have a phone?   What?

513
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:09,180
把它给我   你们绑架我的时候，我把手机落在公寓里了
Give it to me    I left in the apartment where you kidnapped me

514
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,310
我们这不是绑架你
We did not kidnap you

515
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,150
绑架可是严重的刑事犯罪
Kidnapping is a federal offense

516
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,090
听我说
Look at me

517
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:22,230
有些人打算伤害你
There are people out there who want to hurt you

518
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,340
我想吐
I feel sick

519
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:31,220
吐到窗外吧
Throw outside the window

520
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,200
门打不开
It doesn't open

521
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,220
你上次吃东西是什么时候   我不记得了
When was the last time you had something to eat?   I do not know

522
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:39,260
我们得给她找点吃的
We need to get her some food

523
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:56,300
你画画多久了？   不知道，怎么了
How long have you drawing?   I do not know, why?

524
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:59,300
只是随口问问
Just asking

525
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,330
我画的不好
They suck

526
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,150
随你怎么说
Whatever you say

527
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:10,190
他们只不过是两个嬉皮士罢了，人那么好，谁会要杀他们呢
They are two nice Hippies, who would want to kill them

528
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,320
看样子你受惊不小
You has a shock

529
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:15,270
你的体内分泌了大量的肾上腺素，它们促使你决定你应该迎战还是逃跑
It's pumping adrenaline call you fight or flight

530
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:20,080
你得过一阵子才能平静下来
It's gonna take a while to calm down

531
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:30,260
我吃不下去，体内肾上腺素太多
I can't eat  I'm pumping adrenaline

532
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,330
我知道有个安全的地方
I know place she would be safe

533
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:36,140
什么意思？
What is that mean?

534
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,310
我才不要去愚蠢的学校呢
I am going to stupid school

535
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,120
她们有统一的服装标准，这就是她们的校服
They have a dress code, this is what they wear there

536
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,350
我认识那的校长，你在那很安全
I know a headmistress, you'll be safe there

537
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:44,380
校长？那是个什么东西？一个骗子么？
A headmistress? What's that? A con man?

538
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:52,140
你想活还是想死？
Do you want to live? Do you?

539
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,270
我想活
Yes

540
00:43:53,410 --> 00:44:00,220
那你就按我们说的做，去我们叫你去的地方，直到你安全下来，明白了么？
Then you'll go where we say and stay until we say it is safe, do you understand

541
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:06,270
真是咄咄逼人啊，好吧好吧，我懂了
You are very intense, you know that? Yes, I understand

542
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,420
你到我这干啥   雷彻找到了那个女孩
What are you doing here?   Reacher has the girl

543
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,260
这不是你应该搞定的事么
You are supposed to take care of that

544
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:26,400
你们这些人，一换上便衣，就不按规矩行事了
You people, you take off the uniform and lose all discipline

545
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,340
他是怎么找到她的
How did he find her?

546
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:30,170
我还正想问你呢
Exactly

547
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:33,340
他们怎么这么厉害，居然找到了那个女孩
我怎么知道
How did they?   How would I know?

548
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:36,450
他今天早些时候是不是来过
If he was here earlier today?

549
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,460
你在监视我？你他妈的以为你是谁啊
You're watching me now? Who the hell do you think you are?

550
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:49,280
你告诉他们什么了？   你在胡说些什么
What did you give them?   What are you talking about?

551
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:54,940
你告诉他们什么了？
What did you give him?

552
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:57,320
还轮不到你来审问我
I don't have to be interrogated by guys like you

553
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:04,260
他和那个婊子到我家来，然后威胁我，我什么都没告诉他们
He came in here with that bitch and threaten me  I gave them nothing

554
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:09,450
有什么好笑的，我是花钱雇你来解决这个烂摊子的
What is so funny  We hired you to clean up this mess

555
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:12,220
你说得对
You are right

556
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:16,190
他来的时候摸过这个电话，对吧？   你想说什么？
He touch this phone, didn't he?   So?

557
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:38,430
我要是还有其它办法也不会来麻烦您了，她就在这待几天
I mean really, if I had any other choice, she would be here only for few days

558
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,310
没事的，不用顾虑太多
You know how we feel that here Susan

559
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:43,480
谢谢   见到你真好
Thank you    So nice to meet you

560
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:46,250
我也很高兴见到你
Good to see you too

561
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:56,000
告诉我你们的感受，你们是人，有感情，不是没生命的照相机，看到这些手你们有什么感受
Show me what you feel  You are not a camera  What do you feel about these hands

562
00:45:56,110 --> 00:46:00,540
手部皮肤质量好么？ 它们是健康孩子的手么？ 皮肤上有没有什么病痛的征兆？
Are these nurturing hands? Are they health children? Do they carry pain?

563
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:07,260
欢迎来到彭布罗克学校。我叫爱莉米娅   我叫梅
Welcome to Pembroke  I'm Elemia    I'm May

564
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:10,300
我叫卡拉   跟我们走走呗
Carla    Come with us

565
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,440
你来这之前是在哪上学的？   我去过好几个地方
Where did you do before this?   Different places

566
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,250
想找一份工作真的很难
Troubles in getting job applications

567
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:20,240
你参加了那个考试么？    我打算过阵子就去考
Have you take a test yet?   I decide to do it right away

568
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:23,280

May, you earrings where did you get it

Oh thank you, actually my dad bought them in New York

570
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:30,240
我妈妈答应我说带我去巴黎过圣诞节
My mother promised me we would ** when we are in Paris for Christmas

571
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,440
哇巴黎啊   是啊，那是个很美的城市
Paris    Yes it's beautiful

572
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:04,360
你在干嘛，还给我   你不是说你没有手机么
What are you doing?   You said you did not have a phone

573
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:07,540
你用了几次手机？    你是问我从出生开始到现在用了几次手机么？
How many time did you use this?   In my life?

574
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,500
我们走，拿上你的东西
Let's go, get your things

575
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:15,460
没事的，我只给一个人发了短信
Nothing, just one person

576
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:18,450
抱歉，我们得走了
Excuse me, we have to go

577
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:21,330
谢谢   等我一会
Thank you    Give me one second

578
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:23,440
发生什么了
What the hell is going on

579
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,450
她刚才给人发短信了   妈的，这有什么问题
She was texting    Shit, what's wrong with that?

580
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:28,380
他们可以定位追踪到这里
They could trace us

581
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:30,480
好吧，我们走
Come on, let's go

582
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:34,520
上车
Get in

583
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:50,390
讲真，这个地方真是可笑
For God's sake, that place is ridiculous

584
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:53,420
这里改变了我的一生
That place changed my life

585
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:56,430
很抱歉我用了手机
Sorry about the phone

586
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:02,370
说   我对超源公司做了点调查
Go    I'm doing some digging about ParaSource

587
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:04,510
他们有些雇员在阿富汗遇上了点麻烦
Some of their boys got into trouble in Afghanistan

588
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:08,520
在他们公司经济不景气的时候又丢了几份和政府之间的大合同
And lost some big government contracts when they are in financial trouble

589
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,390
为啥他能用手机？
Why does he get to have a phone?

590
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:12,520
这个丹尼尔 普东       等会 你现在安静点
Daniel Prudhomme    Hold on  You need to be quiet

591
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:15,570
抱歉，刚才说到丹尼尔 普东了，我们继续
Okay, sorry  Daniel Prudhomme  Keep going

592
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,540
他就是跟少校的调查员谈过话的那位公司雇员
The contractor her guys talk to

593
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:19,550
他住在新奥尔良
He lives in New Orleans

594
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:24,550
在那次谈话后他就消失了，听说是一路回家找自己的夫人和孩子了
He disappeared right after he was interrogatred  He drove back home to his wife and kids

595
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:28,620
超源公司的总部就在新奥尔良，他们知道普东已经回去了，所以在满城找他
New Orleans is Parasource's home base  And they knew he was back and they were looking for him

596
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,370
我们要去新奥尔良   先生，还有其它事要告诉您   说
We are going to New Orleans    Sir, something else    yes?

597
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,570
摩根上校死了
Colonel Morgan was killed

598
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,610
行凶者的凶器上发现了你的指纹
Your prints were found on the murder weapon

599
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,580
军士，很感谢您的帮助
Appreciate your help, sergeant

600
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:44,420
我们得抢在超源公司抓住他之前找到他
We need to find Prudhomme before Parasource gets hold him

601
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,530
诺福克有个机场
There is an airport in Norfolk

602
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:49,560
我们需要信用卡   还要身份证
We need credit cards    And IDs

603
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:58,590
运通卡？威士卡？
American Express?
Visa? ***

604
00:48:58,590 --> 00:49:02,620
还有不少学习卡呢
SAT, extracirricular activities

605
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:06,470
这能让我们的新奥尔良之旅畅通无阻
He takes us all to New Orleans

606
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,700
除非你打算让我闭嘴
Unless you want me to shut up

607
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,540
你这小混蛋
You little shit

608
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:36,550
你确定要这么做么
Sure about this?

609
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:39,690
不    那么我来？
No    Want me to do it?

610
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,670
不
No

611
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:47,470
就搞定那个穿夹克的吧
10 jacket

612
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,520
行
Yeah

613
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,650
抱歉撞到你了   没事
Sorry excuse me    No problem

614
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,600
祝您旅途愉快
Enjoy your flight

615
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:42,510
坐在飞机的紧急安全区的旅客
You are seated in the emergency exit row

616
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:47,580
请阅读信息卡背面的相关须知
Please read your responsibility for an emergency seating on the back of the information card

617
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:50,690
信息卡在您前方的口袋里
located in the pocket in front of you

618
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:08,690
以前坐过飞机么

619
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:15,540
拿着
Here

620
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,710
你在逗我吧
You're kidding

621
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,620
我才不想吐呢
I'm not going to puke

622
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,750
那好
Good

623
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:43,730
你在军队待多久了？
So, how long have you in the army for?

624
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,660
待了10年吧      可以的
10 years    Oh well

625
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:50,640
你的军衔是？   少校
What's your rank?   Major

626
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,590
所以是不是你给人下命令
So, if you give a guy orders?

627
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:57,820
他就得遵守，比如：动作快点，对吧？
He has to obey, like fast?

628
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,580
是这样
Yeah

629
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,670
如果有人想找你的麻烦，你就用几招把他打倒，对吧？
And if he tries messing with you,you know like, all kind of moves, right?

630
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:07,680
是这样   太好了

你没结婚吧？   没呢
You're not married, right?   No

634
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,570
你是同性恋么？ 我不歧视同性恋的，我认识不少女同
Are you gay? It's totally fine, I know many lesbian

635
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,630
我不是
No  I'm not gay

636
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:25,580
我还以为所有的女兵都是同性恋呢
I think all lady soldiers are gay

637
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,590
有些是，有些不是，军队内外一样啊
Some are  Some aren't  Like in the real world

638
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:35,580
所以，雷彻是你的男朋友？
So, Reacher is your boyfriend?

639
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,330
不是   那你们只是酒肉朋友？
No    Friends with benefits

640
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:43,290
不   你的意思是你不想找男朋友
No    You mean no, you don't want to

641
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,440
还是他不想做你的男朋友
Or, he does not want to  Your guys are really ***

642
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:53,440
好吧，我大概知道是怎么回事了
Allright, I see how it is

643
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:57,590
我的父亲也是个军人
My father was in the military

644
00:52:58,430 --> 00:52:59,590
真的么
Really?

645
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,570
我从没见过他
Never met him

646
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:04,570
在我出生前他就走了
He left before I was born

647
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:07,440
他的驻地在哪
Where were his station?

648
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:09,640
大概是在华盛顿附近吧
Around DC, I guess

649
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:13,420
他叫什么？
What is his name?

650
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:20,470
坎迪丝从来没跟我提起过这个   坎迪丝是？   她是我妈   哦哦
我妈说我爸是个大英雄，也是个大混蛋
Candice won't talk about it    Candice?   My mom    Oh
Just say he was a big hero and a total asshole

651
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:29,580
我们马上准备降落，可以四处走动一下，如果想去洗手间的，现在可以去了
We are beginning our descend  Stretch your legs  If you want to use lavatory, use it now

652
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:42,440
我马上就回来
I will be right back

653
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,640
还是这种发型
Same haircut

654
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:05,580
你们这个公式的雇员都是去一家理发店么
You and your contractor go to the same barber?

655
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:23,380
检查一下手机
Check it

656
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:57,400
他现在不太舒服，你用这边这个吧
Oh, he was not feeling well  You may want to use this one

657
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,500
说
Go

658
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:15,410
把你手下的两个人带走吧
Take 2 after the board

659
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:19,440
你就是跟我交过手的那位吧
They were beaten

660
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:22,520
你是何方神圣？特种部队队员？
Where were you, ***? SEAL team?

661
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,360
差不多吧
Something like that

662
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:25,460
你什么时候回来的
When did you get back?

663
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:29,360
我经常想起以前的那些日子
I try every day

664
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:31,370
你不怀念么？
Do not you miss it?

665
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:34,630
一点也不   我觉得你内心还是很怀念的
Not a bit    I think you do

666
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,390
像我们这样的人
People like us

667
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,550
永远也无法融入到现实社会中
We can never go back to the world

668
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:43,450
我们会伤人
We hurt people

669
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,620
我们周围的人也因我们受伤
And the people around us get hurt

670
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:51,470
把特纳交给我，走远点，我保证不伤害那个小女孩
Leave Turner to me  Walk away now, and I won't hurt the little girl

671
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,380
你来新奥尔良么？
You come in New Orleans?

672
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:57,430
我会考虑一下的
I'll think about it

673
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:01,400
当心哦，我会去找你算账的   我会的
Look me out    I will

674
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:15,580
追！
Go! Go!

675
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:43,410
追！
Go!

676
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:52,610
等等！
Wait! Wait! Wait!

677
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,750
我建议你们最好告诉我到底是怎么回事
Now you are going to tell me what's going on

678
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:27,500
要不然待会我可就尖叫吸引别人注意了
Or the first chance I got, I am going to scream

679
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:29,560
或者一把抓住附近的警察
Or grab a policeman!

680
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:33,660
听我说   我们是在保护你
Okay, look    We are protecting you

681
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:36,560
我发现      你
I found out that      That you do not

682
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:38,580
你能不能闭嘴
Can you stop?   Just

683
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:41,590
某些人从政府那偷了点东西   偷了什么？
Some people were stealing from the government    Steal what?

684
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:45,550
现在你知道的越少越好   放屁！
At this point, the less you know, the better    Bullshit!

685
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:49,590
这些信用卡是我的，没有它们你连飞机都上不了
I got those credit cards, okay? You are not gonna board that plane without it

686
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:51,770
他们也在追杀我
They are after me too

687
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:57,510
为什么会这样
Why?

688
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:00,570
我们得把真相告诉她
You need to tell her

689
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:13,680
他们觉得你是我的女儿
They think you are my daughter

690
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,750
真好笑
That's funny

691
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:25,530
你不是我的父亲   你怎么知道的
You're not my father    How do you know?

692
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:30,570
这么说吧，你凭什么觉得你是我的父亲？
Well, why do you think you are?

693
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:34,610
因为你的母亲向军方提起诉讼，说我是你的父亲
Because your mother file a complaint suit with the army claiming I was

694
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:56,560
只有一间有两个卧室的套房了，一晚350美元
All we have available is a level two bedroom suit   350 dollars

695
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,790
我能用现金付款么
Can I pay in cash?

696
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:04,710
所以我们要做一下亲子鉴定么
So we are gonna take a DNA test?

697
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:09,760
我们现在很忙，那些事暂且不提
We are busy right now

698
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,780
有些事我想告诉你
I'm goona tell you something

699
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,560
你可能会觉得很生气
You are gonna get angry

700
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:21,680
这一切都是个误会，都是我的错
This whole thing is my fault

701
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:25,650
此话怎讲？
How so?

702
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:29,860
提起诉讼的主意是我想出来的
I was the one who makes the file thing

703
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:32,730
希望我们家的境况能好一些
Thought she could get me out of it

704
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:38,710
你懂的，拿到了赡养费，能让我们的生活好一些
Money, child support  Help her get a life together

705
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,690
她出狱后情况好多了
She has got better since she got out

706
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:45,820
还找了份工作
Got a job

707
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:50,790
兴许她能自己买个小房子呢
Maybe she could get a little house

708
00:59:57,650 --> 00:59:59,700
你很生气
You are mad

709
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:02,650
我能从你脸上看出来
I can see it in your face

710
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:05,790
我并不生气啊   不，你很生气
I am not mad    Yes, you are

711
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:09,630
你觉得我不过是个小孩罢了，需要人保护
You think I'm a little kid so you are worried about protect me

712
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:12,870
对
Ya

713
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:14,770
所以呢？   所以我不想待在这了
So?   So, I do not want to be here

714
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:17,650
你也不想我在这，所以我该走了
So you do not want me here  So I should just leave

715
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:23,820
可以啊，你打算去哪？
Okay  Where are you gonna go?

716
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:52,780
.  真是难忘       来吃点东西吧
And I just    Never forget  it's just      Food

717
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,780
终于有吃的了   谢谢
Oh, God    Thanks

718
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:58,760
饿死了，谢谢啦   没事
I am starving  thanks    Yes

719
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:07,810
她睡着了
She is out

720
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:23,680
这就是我们的晚餐约会么
Our dinner date

721
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:27,680
这香槟(实际上是可乐)喝起来还是刺骨的冷
The champagne is still chilly

722
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:31,680
我知道你是那种很浪漫的人
I knew you're the romantic type

723
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:38,730
雷彻，上次你跟我打完电话以后，你设想过会发生什么事么？
So Reacher, after those phone calls  What exactly did you think would happen?

724
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:42,930
我觉得我们能坐下来吃顿饭，喝点小酒
I think, a nice dinner  Maybe some wine

725
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:52,820
吃完饭呢？
And after dinner?

726
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:55,800
去你家吧？
Back to your place  Maybe?

727
01:01:56,810 --> 01:01:59,830
还是去你的小汽车旅馆比较好
Supposed to be your city motel

728
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:03,880
永远不要低估城市旅馆的魅力
Never underestimate the charm of city motel

729
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:06,970
我懂的
I could see the appeal

730
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:12,990
也许事成之后就可以去了
What do you think we are looking for a city motel once I found Prudhomme?

731
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,760
我跟你一起去找普东
I'll go with you

732
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,770
我们中的其中一人去吧
One of us should go

733
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:20,970
我去吧
So I'll go

734
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:23,810
得留个人下来照顾她
Someone needs to stay here with her

735
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:29,960
怎么？就因为我是女的，我就要留下来照顾她？
What? Because I'm a woman? I should be the babysitter

736
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,740
我可不知道怎么照顾人
I do not know how to be the babysitter

737
01:02:32,770 --> 01:02:34,800
你觉得我知道？   没错
Do you think that I do?   Yes

738
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,940
你知道么，我当兵这么久都不得不忍受这种性别歧视
You know I don't have to put up with this crap my entire career

739
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:42,020
你这呆瓜，想让我待在这，免谈，不少男军官都以为自己比我能力强
Forget it dickhead, every male officer who think they are smarter

740
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:46,790
你已经被解除指挥权了   我才是这的指挥官
You've been relieved of command    I am the commanding officer here

741
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,790
你不过是一个军队的逃犯罢了   你也是啊
You are the fugitive from the military justice    So did you

742
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:50,800
我们都是罪犯啊
So we are both criminals

743
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:53,000
我去吧，你待在这
I am going

744
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:56,850
少校，动手可不是个好主意
It's a bad idea, major

745
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:17,980
谢谢
thank you

746
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:20,030
普东女士
Mrs Prudhomme

747
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:25,960
听着，我已经跟你们说过了，我不知道他在哪
Look  I told you people I do not know where he is  Okay?

748
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:30,880
普东女士，我是一位宪兵   他跟你毫无瓜葛
Miss Prudhomme  I'm an MP    He is done with all of that

749
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,940
他需要我的保护
He needs protection

750
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:36,050
他需要我的帮助
He needed my help

751
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:40,990
是么，恐怕天王老子也救不了他
Well  He needs all the help he can get

752
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:44,030
他有没有经常联系的朋友？
Have any friends?

753
01:03:44,810 --> 01:03:47,830
经常去的地方？
Places? Places he hangs out

754
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:52,050
还有你们警察都不知道的地方？
Any places that police didn't know?

755
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:55,920
你有他的照片么
Do you have a photo?

756
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,970
有
Ya

757
01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:16,860
用完了直接烧掉吧，我不在乎
You can burn it I don't care

758
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:34,140
你们又跟踪我
You followed me in here

759
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:36,980
这是个错误
That was a mistake

760
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:39,950
你没意识到我们在监视他的老婆
You didn't think we are watching the wife

761
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,970
这才是个错误
That was a mistake

762
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,160
也许吧
Maybe

763
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:47,000
所以你想干嘛
So how do you want do this?

764
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:51,100
一个个上如何？
How about one at a time? I get a baseball bat

765
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:55,950
特纳在哪
Where is Turner?

766
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:01,190
哟，枪都掏出来了
Really

767
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:04,200
如果你们只是想杀了我，就不会现在才动手了
If you are gonna kill me, you won't have done it by now

768
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:09,070
我们不会杀了你，但我们会折磨你
We are not gonna kill you  Not until you begged for it

769
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,170
让你痛不欲生，只求一死
And you're going to beg

770
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:14,960
要我打左腿还是右腿？
Left or right?

771
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,060
特纳两分钟后会给我打电话
Turner is gonna call me in 2 minutes

772
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,120
如果我没接
If I do not answer it

773
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:24,930
或者是声音提起来有些异样，她就消失了，你们永远找不到她
If I don't pick up, if I sound distressed, she is in the wind

774
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:27,010
你只是在虚张声势罢了
You're bluffing

775
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:29,150
那就试试看啊
Go for it

776
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:36,160
现在你得求着我跟她好好说话了
You are goona make me talk without tipping me off

777
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:41,030
你不能折磨我，也不能杀了我
You can not torture me  You can not kill me

778
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:44,200
但你待会恐怕不得不得杀了我
And you are definitely gonna have to kill me

779
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:47,940
把手机给我，等等！
Give me the phone  Wait!

780
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:50,150
丢过来
Toss it over

781
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,010
伙计，轮到你了
Fellas

782
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:40,050
我跟你们说过，我讨厌别人跟踪我
I told you I don't like being followed

783
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:55,070
你完蛋了，杰克！
You're done, Jack!

784
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:57,090
杀了你还不够
killing you is not enough though

785
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:00,210
我收回我说过的话，我曾经承诺过不伤害那个小女孩
So I'm going to take back my promise about not hurting the little girl

786
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:02,090
你不会得逞的
Never gonna happen

787
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:04,150
我会的
Sure it is

788
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:09,010
总有一天，她会走在从学校回家的路上
One day, she would be walking home from school

789
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:15,140
也许她是打算出去跟人约会或者跟朋友逛街
Maybe she will be on a date or hanging out with her friends

790
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:20,130
那时我看你还怎么保护她
And you won't be there to protect her

791
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:41,100
我们再试一次，这次我要你抓住这个
Okay, let's try again  This time I want you take and hold it lower in your dress

792
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:44,300
抓住我的手，拉低，向前迈一步，转个身
So grab it  Yes, bring it low  Step out and rotate

793
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:48,280
就是这样
Nice

794
01:08:49,110 --> 01:08:51,250
嘿，雷彻，看我刚刚学的那一招
Hey, Reacher, check this out

795
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:54,290
准备好了么？   开始吧
Ready?   Yes

796
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:59,330
很好
Good

797
01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:02,060
你觉得怎么样
What do you think?

798
01:09:02,110 --> 01:09:07,210
相信我，在你做出这种招式之前，你肯定已经死了
Trust me, before you have act like that move  We could just assume you are dead already

799
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:12,150
我们再来一次
Let's try again

800
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:14,160
待会我们再练点复杂的
We are gonna have to kick a ball into it, okay?

801
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,230
欢迎来到诺兰基地，我是库卓中尉
Welcome to Nolan Camp  I'm Lieutenant Kudrow

802
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:18,100
我们将竭尽所能提供帮助
We are here to help in anyway we can

803
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:19,200
查清了他们的底细么？
What do you have on them?

804
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:22,370
飞机上的那两个人以前当过兵，伤势严重
Guys on the plane were ex military  Hurt pretty bad

805
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:26,120
你知道他们为谁工作么？   他们说自己是无业人员
Do we know who they are working for?   They claim to be unemployed

806
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,180
我就知道他们不会老实交代的
Yes, right

807
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:32,250
给我查清他们的银行记录，服役记录，旅行记录，枪支许可证，驾驶证情况
I want their bank records, service records, foreign travels, gun registration and car registration

808
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:36,170
哪怕像他们如何煮鸡蛋，喜欢吃哪种味道的冰淇淋这样的细节也得给我挖出来
How do they like their eggs, favorite flavor ice cream  I wanted them yesterday

809
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:38,180
是，长官！
Yes, Sir!

810
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:48,230
她睡着了么？
she asleep?

811
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:58,260
我跟普东的夫人谈过了
Spoke to Prudhomme's wife

812
01:09:58,290 --> 01:10:01,120
结果发现他现在是个瘾君子
Turns out he is a junkie

813
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:06,210
她不知道他在哪
She didn't know where he was

814
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:08,320
但她给了我一张他的照片
But she gave me a photo

815
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:17,180
你是因为我让你留下来照看孩子
Are you more upset that I treated you like a woman?

816
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:19,440
还是因为我对你过于粗鲁而感到生气
Or did I treated you like a man?

817
01:10:20,290 --> 01:10:23,290
我很生气，因为你太自负了
I am upset because I ** you

818
01:10:24,330 --> 01:10:27,320
我应该去找她的，我能搞定
I should be the one goes to talk to her  I can handle myself

819
01:10:27,370 --> 01:10:31,130
我是女人，懂她的心理，能做的更好   也许吧
I could have done better    Maybe

820
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:34,310
谢谢你的道歉咯
Appreciate the apology

821
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:38,380
你什么决定都要自己做，这真的很重要么？
妈的，你真是个混蛋
Is it really so important you make every decisions?
Oh god you are such a dick

822
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,330
我
Okay, I

823
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:52,350
我以前一直是一个人工作
I am used to working alone, okay?

824
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:56,230
我习惯了一个人独处的日子
I used to being alone

825
01:10:56,290 --> 01:11:00,230
很明显   我正试着跟你道歉
Obviously    I am trying to apologize

826
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:03,320
你继续说
Go on

827
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:05,200
你觉得我们应该怎么做
What do you think we should do?

828
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:10,340
别在我面前摆出一副屈尊俯就的样子！   我在问你的意见呢
Do not patronize me, okay?   I'm asking your opinion

829
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:13,380
我们可以去VA找他   超源公司肯定第一时间就去过了
We can go to the VA    which is the first place Parasource looked

830
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:16,220
那去当地的宪兵局问问情况？   我们肯定马上就被逮捕了
How about local MP then?   They will arrest us in a ***

831
01:11:16,270 --> 01:11:19,240
雷彻，那么你的计划是什么？
Okay, then what's your plan then, Reacher?

832
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:21,460
你竟然不知道下一步该怎么办
So you do not know what to do?

833
01:11:21,470 --> 01:11:26,340
你真是头脑简单，只知道打打杀杀
You are like something **** all you want is blood

834
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,480
你还是不明白我为什么生气吧？
You still do not get it, do you?

835
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:34,390
他们杀了我手下的人，我工作也丢了，生活全毁了
They killed my men, took away my job, my life

836
01:11:34,430 --> 01:11:38,450
我不是和你一样想抓住他们，我比你更想抓住他们
I do not want them as bad as you  I want them more

837
01:12:14,410 --> 01:12:19,240
看看她醒么，然后买点早饭，我们再想下一步该怎么办
Go to see if she is up  Get some breakfast and figure out the next move

838
01:12:19,450 --> 01:12:22,510
你打算拿那个小孩怎么办   你又不是不知道她的名字
What would we do with the kid?   The kid has a name

839
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,460
我知道
I know that

840
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:30,360
你干嘛对她那么狠   生活就是这么的艰难
Why are you so tough on her?   It's a hard world

841
01:12:31,330 --> 01:12:33,330
我敢肯定，她比我更明白这一点
I'm sure she knows it better

842
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:36,320
你怎么敢肯定她就明白这些道理
Do you think she knows that already

843
01:12:36,350 --> 01:12:39,380
雷彻，如果她是你的亲生女儿呢？
Reacher, what if she's yours?

844
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:46,400
那我15年前真是犯了个错误
I shouldn't have been there 15 years ago

845
01:12:57,290 --> 01:13:01,320
山姆？我的天
Sam? Oh man

846
01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:04,420
她会去哪呢   我去穿好衣服
She is not here  And go where?   I'll get dressed

847
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:06,420
她之前有跟你说过什么吗？
Did she say anything to you?

848
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:09,410
她说她应该离开这里
She says she should leave

849
01:13:15,490 --> 01:13:18,390
怎么了   你去哪了
What's up   Where were you?

850
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:19,550
我出去了   你疯了么
Out    Are you crazy?

851
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,400
我只是想帮你们   你要怎么帮我们呢
I'm just trying to help    How are you gonna help, huh?

852
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,530
你们说普东是个瘾君子   我们可没告诉过你
You guys said Prudhomme was a junkie    We never told you

853
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:26,330
我听见你们的谈话了
I heard your guys talking

854
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:30,370
街上的某些家伙说附近有流浪汉聚集地
Some dude on the street says place for homeless

855
01:13:30,450 --> 01:13:34,450
大概是旧仓库厂房吧，那边消息比较灵通
Some old warehouse  People talked thing

856
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:37,550
你知道那边有多危险么？   我说过了，我能照顾好自己
Do you have any idea how dangerous that was?   I told you I can take care of myself!

857
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:40,500
你才15岁，外面正有人追杀你，知道么？
15 years old  Some people are looking for you, okay? They're looking for us

858
01:13:40,530 --> 01:13:42,360
有人陪着我的
I just picked out the guy

859
01:13:42,410 --> 01:13:45,570
那又怎样，所以他会保护你么？   不，至少他不会伤害我
And what, he's supposed to protect you?   No, I gave him shit

860
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:48,550
强者从不伤害他人，弱者才会那么做
Strong guys don't hurt you  The weak guys do that

861
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:53,450
强者总有个小妹妹什么的
Strong guys always have little sisters or they want one

862
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:56,560
我不知道为什么，但是事实总是如此
I do not know why, but it's just how it is

863
01:13:57,630 --> 01:14:00,430
我现在太累了，去睡会
I'm really tired

864
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:07,420
我还是不理解你为什么那么做
I can not do this

865
01:14:19,610 --> 01:14:21,630
你这么做真的很不明智
That was really stupid

866
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:23,610
我懂了
I know

867
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:27,410
请你别再冒那种险了
Please do not ever do that again

868
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:32,430
我这就当你是说“谢谢”了
You are welcome

869
01:14:55,610 --> 01:14:57,670
嘿
Hey

870
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:00,540
我们去找他吧
Let's go find for him

871
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:09,670
[戒毒所] 抱歉，先生，你认识图片上的这个人么
[Opiate Depenency Program] Excuse me, sir, can you look at this picture, please

872
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,570
他可是这的常客了
*** in that circular hell

873
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:18,710
你们去那边找他吧   谢谢了
He's a vet  That's where he gonna be    Thank you

874
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:52,510
我们在找一个叫丹尼尔 普东的人,要付他一笔钱
I have money for Daniel Prudhomme

875
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:57,590
你要给他多少钱？   反正又不是给你
How much?   More than you need

876
01:15:59,630 --> 01:16:02,690
你要给他多少？   你认识普东么
How much?   You know Prudhomme?

877
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:06,570
那得看你出价多少了   别拐弯抹角
Depends    It's a simple question

878
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:08,680
你找他干嘛
What do you want with him?

879
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:12,520
别问太多，告诉我就行了，我要给他钱
I told you, I want to give him money

880
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,720
你就是丹尼尔 普东吧？
You are Danny Prudhomme, right?

881
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:23,740
你是丹尼尔 普东吧？
Specialists Daniel Prudhomme

882
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:29,680
是的，女士   你是超源公司的员工吧
Yes, madam    You work for Parasource?

883
01:16:33,730 --> 01:16:38,670
之前在阿富汗，你跟军士米尔科维奇和齐蓓丽谈过话
You spoke to two MPs, sergeant Mirkovich and Cibelli

884
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:41,640
他们在那边的基地调查过你
They interviewed you in the back room

885
01:16:45,550 --> 01:16:47,580
我从没听说过他们二人
I never heard of them

886
01:16:47,790 --> 01:16:53,740
听好了，米尔科维奇和齐蓓丽军士，米尔科维奇的女儿才6岁
Sergeants Mirkovich and Cibelli  Mirkovich had a 6 year old daughter

887
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:59,640
他的妻子还怀孕了，现在把事情的真相告诉我
His wife is pregnant  Now tell me what happened?

888
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:01,700
他们会杀了我的
They will kill me

889
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:04,580
你不说的话，她现在就杀了你
She would kill you

890
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,750
别听他瞎说，我们会保护你的，你只需要把实情告诉我就行了
No, we will protect you  You have to tell all of it

891
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:15,700
超源公司在巴格达姆基地负责护送车队
Parasource is on a truck convoy at the Bagramair

892
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:21,580
我们还负责基地的安保，我平常只需要谎报我清点的武器数量就行了
We just ran the security for the base  All I had to do just to lie the number of weapons I counted for

893
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:25,680
他给了我很大一笔封口费
He gave me shit load of money to keep my mouth shut

894
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:29,720
我们把那些武器留在那边,那些武器足够发动一场战争了
We leave that shit over there enough to start another war

895
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:34,710
超源公司没把武器运回来，而是把武器在黑市上出手，赚了不少钱
Parasource was selling that weapons instead of bringing them back to the States

896
01:17:35,710 --> 01:17:39,620
后来呢？   我们跟当地军阀协商的时候出了问题
What went on?   With warlord, when we renegotiate

897
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:42,720
超源不同意他们提的条件
Parasource says no

898
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:48,560
第二天，我们车队经过一片罂粟地时被袭击了
The next day, we are driving to these poppy fields, the whole convoy just get ripped off

899
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:55,540
快下车！   我们被攻击了！
Move!   There was an attack!

900
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:57,740
我被吓坏了
I was scared shit of this

901
01:17:57,820 --> 01:18:00,620
我们兵力不够，只能呼叫增援
We search for a rescue

902
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:04,690
救援队赶过来的时候有不少人阵亡
Rescuers get boy killed on the way

903
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:09,640
其中有两个我还认识呢
Two dudes I knew, man

904
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:14,820
他们调查了你之后发生了什么
What happens after you gave your statement?

905
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,780
我把真相告诉了他们
I told them everything

906
01:18:20,830 --> 01:18:26,670
这时超源公司雇的那个杀手来了，他让我不必担心
That was this guy, he works for Parasource, he told me not to worry

907
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:28,730
他说他会搞定这些事的
He'll take care of everything

908
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:32,770
后来我只知道那两个调查员被杀了
Next thing I know that I heard they had been killed

909
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:38,730
我逃走了
I left

910
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:41,730
逃回了美国
And returned back to the States

911
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:46,700
我要是留在那肯定已经死了
I was a dead man if I stay

912
01:18:47,820 --> 01:18:49,880
我
I

913
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:53,720
我从那之后就开始吸毒了
I started shooting after that

914
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:57,690
我不能回家，你知道的
I could just get myself home, you know

915
01:18:57,740 --> 01:19:01,700
我放弃了我自己
I gave myself

916
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:03,730
不，你还没有完全放弃自己
But you did not

917
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:05,740
不
No

918
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:11,890
新奥尔良的毒品比那边的更多，简直是个天堂
More shit in New Orleans than they are making in Afghanistan

919
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:14,860
我感觉不太对
Something is wrong

920
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:17,720
这不合逻辑啊   什么意思？
Numbers don't add up    What do you mean?

921
01:19:17,770 --> 01:19:22,910
为什么一个政府合同承包商要冒着风险在黑市上偷卖军火呢？
Why a huge government contractor risk of selling US army weapons on the black market?

922
01:19:23,850 --> 01:19:27,680
超源公司可比那聪明多了   他确实聪明
Parasoure is smarter than that    He is smart, all right?

923
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:31,890
有没有人检查过箱子是不是空的？
What about   , did anybody check if the crates are empty?

924
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:35,800
估计检查箱子的人都被贿赂了
Probably, there are guys like me

925
01:19:36,770 --> 01:19:39,640
我们得想办法看看箱子里有什么猫腻
We need to get inside these transports

926
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:44,820
飞机周五晚6点出发
The plane leaves every Friday at 6

927
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:49,690
6个小时飞到法兰克福，在那加好油后回来
6 hours to Frankfurt and refuel at home

928
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:52,770
我的天，那不就是今晚么
Jesus, that's tonight

929
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,760
“Back by 9 AM  ”
9点前回来

930
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:12,900
这边的菜放辣酱更好吃
And that's without the hot sauce

931
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:18,750
这餐不亏    先生，你好嘛
And you are gonna tell me that was worth it, sir    Hey, how are you, sir

932
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:21,850
不不，不用   我知道你想的
No, no  thanks    You know you want it

933
01:20:21,890 --> 01:20:26,770
别走啊   今天不行，我身上没钱
Wait a minute    Sorry, not today  I have no money

934
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:30,940
走吧   好吧
Go on now    Okay

935
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:34,780
我的钱包呢   这些贼水平可以
Where is my wallet    Yes, I think they are good

936
01:20:38,990 --> 01:20:42,830
搞定了么   像我们之前安排的那样
Did you do it?   Just like we negotiate

937
01:20:43,870 --> 01:20:46,730
怎么样   搞定了
Well    It's done

938
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:53,710
打个电话给他
Make the call

939
01:20:57,790 --> 01:20:58,980
是你的电话响么
Is that you?

940
01:20:59,740 --> 01:21:01,730
不是我的
No sir, it's not me

941
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:10,780
这是谁的手机
Who is this?

942
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:12,950
我这有个证人，能证明我无罪
I have a witness who can exonerate me

943
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,860
但你得保证他的生命安全
But he has to live first

944
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:17,850
你可以过来跟我谈
Do you want to come and talk about it

945
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:19,800
你能担保他的人身安全么
Are you going to guarantee his safety?

946
01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:21,800
少校，你无权指挥我
You're no longer in charge anymore, Major

947
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:25,770
你也没有指挥权，不是么，还有上级压着你吧
Neither you apparently, operative has been ahead of you this whole time

948
01:21:25,810 --> 01:21:27,780
飞机里的那些人是谁？
Who are those guys on the plane, hm?

949
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:29,780
那些家伙一直想杀了我
He is trying to kill me

950
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:32,880
给你个名字你去查查， 超源公司
Here is a name for you, Parasource

951
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:34,870
再给你报几个地名
A couple of more names to think about

952
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:39,770
巴格达，是不是这些地方听起来很熟悉？
Baghdad, **, that is your first **, is it, Captain?

953
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:41,830
女士，你以为我想像现在这样么
You think I want to be in this position, madam?

954
01:21:41,870 --> 01:21:43,930
我有我的本职工作，我会把它做好
I have a job to do, and I'm gonna do it

955
01:21:43,990 --> 01:21:47,010
我就暂且相信你不是跟他们一伙的吧
I'll take a leap of faith that you don't have anything to do with this

956
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:50,890
看看手机背面，确保没人跟踪你以后过来
Look back of the phone, come alone make sure you're not tailed

957
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:02,740
库卓呼叫埃斯平
Kudrow to Espin

958
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:05,810
库卓呼叫埃斯平   我是埃斯平，请讲
Kudrow to Espin    This is Espin, go

959
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:09,960
我已经查到飞机上那两个人的底细了，有人通过一家设在开曼岛的壳公司给他们转账
We have digged those boys on the plane  Paid by shell company of the Cayman Islands

960
01:22:09,970 --> 01:22:14,960
通过追查他们的银行记录，源头是一家军队合同承包商   超源公司？
Trace their bank accounts back to the big military contractor      Parasource

961
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,840
没错，你怎么知道的
Yes  How did you know that?

962
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:22,050
这你不用管了，给我把超源公司的底细查清，所有信息都给我挖出来
Nevermind, give me everything you can about Parasource, I mean everything

963
01:22:22,090 --> 01:22:24,850
我正在去见证人的路上
On way to pick up my witnesses

964
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:25,950
我们给你派增援过去
We will send backup

965
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:28,950
让他们在两分钟车程外待命，听我指挥
Stand ready for 2 minutes out and wait for my signal

966
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:31,010
长官，这不符合操作流程
That was not procedure, sir

967
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:36,910
对，这不是流程，而是我的命令。雷彻反侦察意识很强，他发现有什么不对就逃走了
No, that was called an order  Reacher is good, he smells heat he will go

968
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:39,900
好的，我们就按您说的做，具体地址在哪
Allright we'll stay 2 minutes out  Where is the address?

969
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:42,930
尼克尔码头，埃斯平通话完毕
Nickel Street Wharf  Espin out

970
01:22:42,930 --> 01:22:46,020
尼克尔码头
Nickel Street Wharf

971
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:48,090
在那的人统统杀掉
No witnesses

972
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:39,960
不许动
Freeze

973
01:23:39,970 --> 01:23:41,940
别开枪
Do not shoot  Don't shoot man

974
01:23:41,970 --> 01:23:43,870
我是来帮你的
I am here to help

975
01:23:43,910 --> 01:23:47,150
你是那个证人么？   对我就是
You are the witness?   Yes, I'm the witness

976
01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:52,110
你人呢
Where the hell are you?

977
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:53,120
他打消了你的疑虑么
You got what you need?

978
01:23:53,130 --> 01:23:57,060
我还没跟他谈   我建议你跟他谈谈再说
Not good enough    I suggest you listen to what he has to say

979
01:23:59,070 --> 01:24:02,980
我会帮你的   好的，跟我走
I can help    Okay  Let's go

980
01:24:03,010 --> 01:24:05,980
现在把事情的原委告诉我吧
I like stories, tell me a story

981
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:11,960
现在我们回到万圣节长跑节目
Now we will return to the Halloween marathon

982
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:16,090
今晚游行的戏服准备好了么
Is your costume ready for tonights parade?

983
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:07,130
我来呼叫增援   去吧
I am gonna call backup    Do it

984
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:12,140
有警官手上
Officers down

985
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:30,070
我子弹打完了
I'm out

986
01:26:19,230 --> 01:26:24,260
你仍然因为谋杀被通缉   是啊，我还是个杀手
You're still want of murder    That's right, I'm still a killer

987
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:27,080
我这个杀手救了你一命呢
It's why I saved you

988
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:29,220
普东把事情的真相都告诉你了么
Did Prudhomme give you a statement?

989
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:31,250
基本都说清了
Most of it

990
01:26:31,290 --> 01:26:34,120
米尔科维奇和齐蓓丽也是你的朋友
Cibelli and Mirkovich were your friends

991
01:26:34,130 --> 01:26:35,180
对
That's right

992
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:38,000
超源公司策划了那次谋杀
Parasource ordered their murders

993
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:39,200
恐怕他们也会对你下手
They are also trying to kill you

994
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:42,230
他们一直在给叛乱分子提供武器
They will provide insurgents with weapons

995
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:45,140
除了这个已经死了的瘾君子说的话，我们恐怕还需要更多证据
We will need more proof than the word of a dead junkie

996
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:48,060
那就得靠你帮我们了
You will help us to get it

997
01:26:49,230 --> 01:26:52,090
这么办，假装逮捕我们
This  Handcuffs and take us into custody

998
01:26:52,130 --> 01:26:56,160
1小时内带我们进超源公司的飞机场
Get us on the TARMAC and Parasource in 1 hour

999
01:27:04,090 --> 01:27:07,280
我需要你“草率”的做个决定
I need you to jump to a conclusion, soldier

1000
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:13,070
行，多谢了
Yeah  thanks

1001
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:14,230
目前我调查到的情况是这样
Okay, here is what we got

1002
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:18,270
6个月前，超源公司丢了几份价值数百万美元的政府合同
6 months ago, Parasource lost government contracts worth of a billion dollars

1003
01:27:18,310 --> 01:27:21,080
他们急需资金，银行也不愿意贷款给他们了
They are bleeding in cash, and the bank would not blood

1004
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:24,220
没想到，一夜之间他们居然开始还钱给债主了
And all of sudden, they start paying back to their creditors

1005
01:27:24,230 --> 01:27:27,320
通过在黑市上卖军火，他们能挣多少钱？
How much money can they really make by selling weapons on the black market?

1006
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:32,200
就算M4步枪5000一把，火箭筒2500一把
M4 for 5 thousand dollars, a rocket launcher half of that

1007
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:34,300
跟政府订单比起来这些小钱都不算啥啊
That's nothing compared to government contracts

1008
01:27:34,350 --> 01:27:37,180
他们的钱从哪来的呢
So where did they get the money?

1009
01:27:40,190 --> 01:27:42,240
这里是宾馆前台，有什么需要帮助的么？
Guest services, how can I help you?

1010
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:44,270
请问你们提供客房服务么？
Hey, do you have room service?

1011
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:49,290
抱歉，我这边的记录显示你是用现金付的房费，如果没有信用卡不能给你送餐
I'm sorry I see you pay cash for your room, I'm afraid we can't provide instant dinner without a credit card

1012
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:52,270
我有信用卡，等一下
Uh, yes  Hold on a second

1013
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:55,290
你应该知道万圣节游行就要开始了吧，要过会才能给你送过去
You do understand that the parade is coming and it may take a while

1014
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:58,150
没问题，尽快就好，我要饿死了
Em, it's fine, I'm starving

1015
01:27:58,160 --> 01:28:00,320
维萨卡可以么？
Eh, visa ok?

1016
01:28:05,410 --> 01:28:09,140
长官，有人使用我们正在监视的被盗信用卡消费了
Sir, we got a hit on one of those stolen cards

1017
01:28:09,140 --> 01:28:12,270
消费地点位于达菲宾馆，皇家街10 18号
Hotel Daphine, 10 18 Royal Street

1018
01:28:13,310 --> 01:28:15,340
找到那个女孩了
It's the girl

1019
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:21,160
我已经警告过他了
I've warned him

1020
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:51,380
请出示您的证件
Identity card

1021
01:28:51,430 --> 01:28:54,360
安东尼 埃斯平上尉，宪兵110部队
Captain Anthony Espin 110 military police

1022
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:57,160
我要通报一下
I'm gonna call this in

1023
01:29:03,410 --> 01:29:07,150
他们正在装货，我们要抓紧时间进去
They are loading the crates  We are gonna get in there

1024
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:20,410
这次的行动内容是什么，少校？
What's drill, Major?

1025
01:29:20,410 --> 01:29:24,290
行动内容是，维护正义
Drill is enforcing the law

1026
01:29:24,390 --> 01:29:27,190
请各位系好安全带
Seat belts, please

1027
01:29:36,410 --> 01:29:39,280
少校，看你的了
Turner    Major

1028
01:29:58,250 --> 01:30:00,280
最后警告一次
Hey, this is your last warning

1029
01:30:00,290 --> 01:30:02,260
趴在地上
On the ground now

1030
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:05,380
都别开枪
Easy

1031
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:10,430
立刻放下武器
Drop your weapons immediately

1032
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:15,340
伙计们，放下武器
Weapon down, boys

1033
01:30:15,350 --> 01:30:18,410
放下武器
Put them down  Take them down

1034
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:26,230
What is going on here？
究竟是怎么回事

1035
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:28,440
You're in charge of this operation？
你是这次行动的负责人？

1036
01:30:28,470 --> 01:30:32,280
我是詹姆斯 哈克尼斯将军，这家公司归我经营
I was General James Harkness, I run this company

1037
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:36,310
我们有理由相信这里有人正在进行违法行为
We have probable cause to believe a crime has been commited

1038
01:30:36,350 --> 01:30:37,380
And you are？
你是哪位？

1039
01:30:37,390 --> 01:30:41,350
苏珊 特纳少校，宪兵110部队
Major Susan Turner 110 Military Police

1040
01:30:41,370 --> 01:30:46,330
就是那个被指控为间谍的宪兵特纳少校？
The Major Turner one of the MPs accused of espionage?

1041
01:30:46,370 --> 01:30:48,430
你是想说我们都是间谍么？
You mean these MPs?

1042
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:54,250
这些箱子里本应装着属于美国军方的武器
This crates are supposed to contain the weapons belonging to the US armies

1043
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:57,320
事实上你背地里把这些武器卖给叛乱分子
In fact you sold them to insurgents

1044
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:59,490
所以这些是空箱子
And these are now empty

1045
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:04,460
你知道我是谁么，少校？
Do you know who I am, Major?

1046
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:09,420
是的，将军，我知道
Yes  General  I know

1047
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:14,450
你就是那个应该为我两位手下之死负责的人
You're the man responsible for the death of two of my man

1048
01:31:15,430 --> 01:31:17,330
现在打开箱子，接受检查
Now open up those crates

1049
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:24,500
要不然等我抓着你的头发，一巴掌扇在你脸上就不太好了
before I grab you by your hair plugs and bitch slap that smug look of your face

1050
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:31,420
根据货物清单，箱子里有什么货物？
What does the manifestors say in there?

1051
01:31:32,330 --> 01:31:35,300
84毫米口径火箭筒，长官
84 mm rocket launcher sir

1052
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:37,460
打开这个箱子
Open it

1053
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:41,480
打开吧
Open it

1054
01:31:59,510 --> 01:32:01,440
打开那个箱子
Open that one

1055
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:06,490
打开那个箱子
Open it!

1056
01:32:07,460 --> 01:32:09,390
打开吧
Open it

1057
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:18,380
打开那个箱子
Open that one

1058
01:32:18,410 --> 01:32:20,610
听不懂我说的话么，打开那个箱子！
I said open up that crate!

1059
01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:24,600
打开吧
Open it

1060
01:32:32,540 --> 01:32:39,380
中尉，做好你的本职工作，给我逮捕这个臭女人
Litenauant, do your goddamn job and place this goddamn woman under arrest

1061
01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:03,560
抱歉，少校
Sorry Major

1062
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:05,560
你得跟我走
You are gonna need to come with me

1063
01:33:13,550 --> 01:33:15,420
你说的对
You are right

1064
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:17,550
这说不通
The numbers don't add up

1065
01:33:23,470 --> 01:33:25,440
长官
Sir, sir

1066
01:33:25,470 --> 01:33:26,440
拦住那个家伙
Stop that man

1067
01:33:26,470 --> 01:33:28,440
雷彻   拦住他
Reacher    Stop that man

1068
01:33:30,390 --> 01:33:31,580
拦住他
Stop him!

1069
01:33:32,590 --> 01:33:34,620
干掉他，马上！
Take him down, now!

1070
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:37,480
兄弟，别乱动
Deep breath, son

1071
01:33:55,470 --> 01:33:57,530
高纯度鸦片
Pure opium

1072
01:34:03,620 --> 01:34:05,610
现在说的通了
Now the numbers add up

1073
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:15,450
把他带走吧
Get him out of here

1074
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:29,460
你好
Hello

1075
01:34:29,730 --> 01:34:34,720
晚上好，我在找一男一女两个成年人，带着一个金发的小孩
Good evening, I'm looking for a man and woman, and a little blonde teenager

1076
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:37,630
抱歉，我不能给你提供他们的信息
Sorry, I can not help you that

1077
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:41,670
我在找两个成年人，一个金发女孩
I'm looking for two adults and a little blonde girl

1078
01:34:41,690 --> 01:34:43,620
把他们的房门钥匙给我
Take the key

1079
01:34:49,670 --> 01:34:53,610
已经把将军逮捕了，这儿的鸦片大概有500公斤吧
Take him in custody  It weighs nearly 500 kg

1080
01:34:55,740 --> 01:34:56,730
山姆
Sam

1081
01:34:56,780 --> 01:34:59,680
雷彻，他来找我了，他在这   你说什么？
Reacher, it's him  He is here    What?

1082
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:02,450
在宾馆，快来救我
At the hotel, hurried

1083
01:35:02,690 --> 01:35:05,660
山姆，听我说
Sam, listen to me

1084
01:35:05,730 --> 01:35:07,590
山姆
Sam

1085
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:46,580
你是谁？你在干什么？
What? Wait! Excuse me! Hey! Where are you doing?

1086
01:35:46,610 --> 01:35:48,670
你在干什么？
Hey, where are you doing?

1087
01:35:48,750 --> 01:35:51,650
你要去哪，快回来
Where are you going, come back here!

1088
01:36:03,670 --> 01:36:04,760
她不接电话
She is not answering

1089
01:36:04,770 --> 01:36:06,710
再试几次
Try again

1090
01:36:11,590 --> 01:36:13,820
小心车！
Car! Car!

1091
01:36:46,620 --> 01:36:48,710
山姆！
Sam!

1092
01:36:54,710 --> 01:36:56,830
她肯定不在宾馆里，跑到街上去了
She is not in the hotel  She is on the street

1093
01:36:56,870 --> 01:36:58,840
你怎么知道的
How do you know?

1094
01:36:59,810 --> 01:37:02,780
换做是我，我也会这么做
Because that's what I would do

1095
01:37:14,610 --> 01:37:16,700
我们分头找
I'll go this way

1096
01:37:27,630 --> 01:37:32,700
找到了她在哪么   我找了三家宾馆，根本找不到她
她肯定是躲在哪了
Did you see anything?    Three more hotels  We didn't find a trace, nothing
She is got to be somewhere

1097
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:44,750
雷彻
Reacher

1098
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:47,760
我们来做个了断吧，就我们两个
Let's finish this  Just you and me

1099
01:37:47,770 --> 01:37:50,740
等抓到了你那可爱的小女孩，我要好好的调教一下她
I'm going to have some fun with the pretty little girl

1100
01:37:50,780 --> 01:37:52,640
她不是我女儿
She's not my little girl

1101
01:37:52,650 --> 01:37:54,640
是么，怎么你的声音里充满了恐惧呢
Is that fear in your voice, Jack?

1102
01:37:54,650 --> 01:37:58,810
我要将你碎尸万段
I am going to break your arms, your legs, your neck

1103
01:37:58,860 --> 01:38:01,630
我对此感到非常兴奋
What you hear is an excitement

1104
01:38:01,630 --> 01:38:04,800
嘿，你别待在这
Hey, you! Get out of there! Come on

1105
01:38:05,770 --> 01:38:10,760
借着跟你聊天的当，杰克，我终于找到了一种能让你痛不欲生的方式，能让你痛不欲生
Nice try, Jack  I find a way to hurt you like you've never felt before

1106
01:38:36,660 --> 01:38:38,790
萨曼莎！
Samantha!

1107
01:38:48,790 --> 01:38:49,770
你找到她了吗？
You have her

1108
01:38:49,790 --> 01:38:52,810
波特街，拉菲宾馆附近
Porter street, Laffey Hotel

1109
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:27,740
萨姆快跑！
Sam, run! run!

1110
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:57,910
你敢开枪打我，她就会掉下去
Shoot me and I will let go

1111
01:41:58,910 --> 01:42:01,940
来啊，开枪打我啊，杰克
Shoot me  Shoot me, Jack!

1112
01:42:01,950 --> 01:42:05,010
开枪打我啊！
Well, shoot me!

1113
01:42:05,050 --> 01:42:07,110
超源公司已经完蛋了
Parasource is done

1114
01:42:07,130 --> 01:42:09,100
哈克尼斯已经被逮捕了
Harkness is in custody

1115
01:42:09,130 --> 01:42:11,120
恭喜啊，杰克
Congratulations, Jack

1116
01:42:11,170 --> 01:42:14,900
我他妈根本不在乎
I really don't give a shit

1117
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,060
别哭了
Shut up!

1118
01:42:16,070 --> 01:42:18,130
给我闭嘴
Shut up!

1119
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:21,150
我早就警告过你了，我会对她下手
I told you, this would happen

1120
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:24,910
你不是说要在我们之间来个了断么
You said this was about you and me?

1121
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:28,090
把枪放下
Put the gun down

1122
01:42:30,970 --> 01:42:34,140
好好好
Okay, okay

1123
01:42:35,010 --> 01:42:36,140
我把枪放下
Okay

1124
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:40,110
如果我把枪放下了，你就放她走
If I put down the gun, you let her go

1125
01:42:44,100 --> 01:42:46,070
我的命换她的命
My life for hers

1126
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:48,120
不要！
No!

1127
01:42:49,070 --> 01:42:51,090
这个主意好
I like it

1128
01:42:51,150 --> 01:42:53,050
就这么办
Deal  Jack

1129
01:42:53,050 --> 01:42:55,980
没事的，萨姆，看着我
It's ok,Sam  look at me

1130
01:42:56,020 --> 01:42:57,110
没事的
It's ok

1131
01:42:57,120 --> 01:42:59,880
我们别无选择
It's the only way

1132
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:02,950
没事的
It's okay

1133
01:43:02,970 --> 01:43:04,940
我现在要把枪放下了
I'm going to put the gun down now

1134
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:16,120
你知道这意味着什么吗
You know what this means?

1135
01:43:17,130 --> 01:43:20,960
这意味着，我们早就死了
It means we're dead already

1136
01:43:25,140 --> 01:43:27,110
把枪弄过来
Over here

1137
01:43:27,110 --> 01:43:29,910
用脚踢过来
Kick it over here

1138
01:45:28,310 --> 01:45:31,180
看我这
Look at me

1139
01:45:32,150 --> 01:45:34,210
看我这
You look at me!

1140
01:45:57,230 --> 01:45:59,090
嘿
Hey

1141
01:45:59,130 --> 01:46:00,320
他还好么？   应该吧
Is he okay?   Yes, I think so

1142
01:46:00,330 --> 01:46:02,320
雷彻，看我这
Reacher, look here

1143
01:46:05,140 --> 01:46:07,110
我在这呢
I am right here

1144
01:46:15,300 --> 01:46:17,360
你能走动么
Can you walk?

1145
01:46:18,170 --> 01:46:20,260
我没问题
Sure

1146
01:46:23,220 --> 01:46:25,240
慢点
Easy

1147
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:33,190
伙计，你可是从一栋楼上摔下去了啊   我知道
Dude, you jump off a building    I know

1148
01:46:33,190 --> 01:46:35,250
疼么   还好
It hurts?   Yes

1149
01:46:35,270 --> 01:46:41,210
你知道这楼多高么   我们能换个时间再讨论这个话题么
Did you see how high it was?   Can you possibly have this conversation some other time

1150
01:47:22,120 --> 01:47:24,250
谢谢你
thank you

1151
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:33,200
我觉得简直太逗了，你到这明明是来找我，却意外收获了另外一位女孩
You know, it's funny  You come here looking for one girl and you end up with another

1152
01:47:41,290 --> 01:47:44,230
我还存着你的电话号码呢
I still got your number

1153
01:47:49,210 --> 01:47:50,330
再见，雷彻
Bye, Reacher

1154
01:47:50,370 --> 01:47:52,400
再见
Major

1155
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:15,380
欢迎回来，少校
Good to see you back, Major

1156
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:19,230
谢谢你，上尉
Thank you, Captain

1157
01:48:43,410 --> 01:48:46,470
抱歉，我堵车了
Sorry  I'm stuck in traffic

1158
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:50,420
哟还换了新的T恤衫啊
New T shirt

1159
01:48:50,430 --> 01:48:52,450
真多嘴
Shut up

1160
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:55,230
谢谢你愿意过来
Thanks for coming

1161
01:48:57,400 --> 01:49:00,390
所以，雷彻
So, Reacher

1162
01:49:00,410 --> 01:49:03,380
你到底是不是我的父亲？
Are you my father or not?

1163
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:07,490
等你妈妈来的时候我们就知道了
We will just see when your mother gets here

1164
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:10,460
你还认得她么？
So you recognize her

1165
01:49:11,290 --> 01:49:14,500
我睡过的每个女人我都记得
I tend to remember the women I slept with

1166
01:49:14,500 --> 01:49:18,460
估计她会记得你吧   希望如此
I think she will remember you    Thanks a lot

1167
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:27,320
你并不是我的父亲
You're not my father

1168
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:29,490
为什么这么说？
Why do you say that?

1169
01:49:32,330 --> 01:49:35,230
看到了那边那个服务员么
See that woman over there?

1170
01:49:35,410 --> 01:49:39,470
她给你添了三次咖啡
The waitress who refills your coffee three times

1171
01:49:41,550 --> 01:49:44,310
那个就是我母亲
That's her

1172
01:49:44,490 --> 01:49:48,460
你根本没有表现出认识她的样子
You have no idea who she is

1173
01:49:54,440 --> 01:49:56,340
我一直都知道你不是我父亲
I knew it all along

1174
01:49:56,390 --> 01:49:57,480
恐怕你也是那次吃饭的时候才知道的吧
No, you didn't

1175
01:49:57,490 --> 01:50:00,350
你肯定如释重负吧
I'm sure you are relieved

1176
01:50:02,390 --> 01:50:04,550
并没有
Not really

1177
01:50:14,580 --> 01:50:17,450
把这事忘了吧
Just let it go

1178
01:50:18,380 --> 01:50:20,380
我会慢慢忘记的
I will try

1179
01:50:22,430 --> 01:50:25,400
你不会觉得孤单么
Do not you ever get lonely?

1180
01:50:28,370 --> 01:50:30,530
偶尔吧
Sometimes

1181
01:50:34,490 --> 01:50:37,320
偶尔会觉得孤单
Sometimes

1182
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:43,360
你寂寞了可以给我打电话
You can call me when you do

1183
01:50:56,600 --> 01:50:59,430
所以
So

1184
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:04,560
你要走了吧？
Should you leave?

1185
01:51:07,450 --> 01:51:10,320
对
I'd better go

1186
01:51:10,550 --> 01:51:12,610
我要上课了
I got class

1187
01:51:20,510 --> 01:51:26,450
好好学 你在画画方面真的很有天赋
Just keep that up, because you are really good at it

1188
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:31,550
真的
You're really good

1189
01:51:40,410 --> 01:51:43,540
好好学，情况会好起来的
You will ok then

1190
01:51:50,430 --> 01:51:52,490
那么
Well

1191
01:52:36,450 --> 01:52:39,390
有机会再见，雷彻
See you around, Reacher

1192
01:53:07,580 --> 01:53:11,450
想我了么？
Miss me yet?
