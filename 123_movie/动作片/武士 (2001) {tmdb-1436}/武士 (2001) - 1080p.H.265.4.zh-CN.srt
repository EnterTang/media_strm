1
00:00:00,604 --> 00:00:08,303
Even hunters help animals who lost
their way...

2
00:00:08,777 --> 00:00:12,644
I will remain behind with them
if you decide to leave.

3
00:00:12,814 --> 00:00:14,281
Bastard!

4
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:16,573
Don't you miss your mother?

5
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:20,419
...She would be proud of me.

6
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:26,620
Let's go together, as far as we can.

7
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:33,022
Why aren't we leaving? Yuan's
troops are coming!

8
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:40,425
Let's go.

9
00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:40,430
 

10
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:07,363
Order them to carry the palanquin...
Quickly...

11
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:08,100
 

12
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:11,901
This palanquin is holding us back.

13
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:14,466
General...

14
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,136
Are we waiting for Yuan's
troops to join us?

15
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:22,906
- They ask you to give up the palanquin.
- Who said so?

16
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:22,910
 

17
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:28,000
Get out.

18
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:36,060
Order them to carry my palanquin at once!

19
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:45,301
Stop!

20
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:50,770
The enemy will catch us if we
allow her to ride on that palanquin.

21
00:01:58,753 --> 00:02:00,516
Let us attack them first then.

22
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,656
Let's go.

23
00:02:02,924 --> 00:02:06,360
It's foolish to chase those
who are chasing us.

24
00:02:07,428 --> 00:02:10,355
I make the decisions here,
You just do as you're told.

25
00:02:10,356 --> 00:02:10,357
 

26
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:12,469
Let's go.

27
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:01,110
Cavalry have less of an
advantage in the forest.

28
00:03:01,922 --> 00:03:03,651
Keep pace a meter behind me.

29
00:03:05,058 --> 00:03:07,959
If we lose track you will be
alone against the enemy.

30
00:03:11,008 --> 00:03:12,430
Are you afraid?

31
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:16,432
Stay here until you hear something.
You can rush out then.

32
00:03:17,304 --> 00:03:19,238
I will go down instead of you, General.

33
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,835
Watch the hill.

34
00:03:21,241 --> 00:03:22,674
If we allow them to pass, the
Princess will be lost to us.

35
00:04:17,731 --> 00:04:20,222
On my signal, everyone rush them.

36
00:04:54,568 --> 00:04:57,366
Do exactly as i say, understand?

37
00:04:58,138 --> 00:05:01,835
Dansaeng.

38
00:05:03,109 --> 00:05:04,076
Yes.

39
00:05:33,306 --> 00:05:34,500
Is that you?

40
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:49,899
We'll take care of things here.
Go and protect the Princess.

41
00:08:57,477 --> 00:08:59,001
Look, Byuljang is coming.

42
00:09:06,252 --> 00:09:08,812
This is very important.
Please make sure it is delivered.

43
00:09:09,088 --> 00:09:10,953
Trust my husband.

44
00:09:13,393 --> 00:09:13,882
Now, go.

45
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,404
They are coming!

46
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,404
Go, hurry!

47
00:09:31,511 --> 00:09:35,208
Be careful!

48
00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:25,763
Move, Princess!

49
00:10:41,147 --> 00:10:42,704
The Princess is over there.

50
00:11:20,653 --> 00:11:21,779
Stand back!

51
00:11:22,588 --> 00:11:24,613
Stop it! Don't move!

52
00:11:59,892 --> 00:12:01,553
Take away your filthy hands, you slave!

53
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:04,922
You could have killed me! I'm a Princess!

54
00:12:05,198 --> 00:12:06,062
Stop screaming!

55
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,098
Don't assume you're better than
all of us because you're a Princess.

56
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,266
Leave me alone.

57
00:12:29,255 --> 00:12:30,000
Take this.

58
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:49,532
Byuljang...

59
00:12:50,076 --> 00:12:51,236
How are you feeling?

60
00:12:52,044 --> 00:12:53,200
Where are my troops?

61
00:12:59,685 --> 00:13:00,777
Help me up.

62
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,589
What happened to the enemy?

63
00:13:06,792 --> 00:13:09,158
Daejung wiped out them with
the Joojin troops, sir.

64
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,293
What about the Princess?

65
00:13:16,903 --> 00:13:18,097
She is safe, sir.

66
00:13:20,239 --> 00:13:22,264
We will resume the journey
We are leaving.

67
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,968
It is quite late...

68
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:27,642
and you must rest a bit more, sir.

69
00:13:28,648 --> 00:13:30,377
it's better leaving early in the morning, sir.

70
00:13:34,086 --> 00:13:36,054
I said get up!

71
00:13:38,057 --> 00:13:39,524
If you wish to leave, go by yourself, sir.

72
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,517
We will get some rest and then leave

73
00:13:49,635 --> 00:13:52,001
You have been the agitator all along.

74
00:13:56,175 --> 00:13:58,575
Up to now I've let you have your way...

75
00:14:01,647 --> 00:14:03,205
but I tolerate it no longer.

76
00:14:07,086 --> 00:14:09,919
- Leave him alone!
- Dochoong, Seat down...

77
00:14:13,593 --> 00:14:15,151
General, please remove your sword.

78
00:14:15,895 --> 00:14:16,862
How dare you!

79
00:14:27,173 --> 00:14:30,631
Byuljang, arrest these men at once.

80
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,944
Now!

81
00:14:39,485 --> 00:14:40,383
Look here...

82
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,150
Why don't we make Captain Daejung
as our leader from now on?

83
00:14:44,724 --> 00:14:46,885
That's the only way we'll
reach the castle, right?

84
00:14:47,226 --> 00:14:48,220
Dochoong!

85
00:14:53,466 --> 00:14:54,228
General...

86
00:14:57,737 --> 00:15:00,763
Pass your authority to Daejung.

87
00:15:25,197 --> 00:15:27,324
You think we've come this far alone?

88
00:15:30,302 --> 00:15:32,099
With everything swirling around us

89
00:15:33,606 --> 00:15:36,006
someone has had to make the tough decisions.

90
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:38,135
Did you know that?

91
00:15:48,387 --> 00:15:50,685
I made these decisions on
behalf of the group.

92
00:16:09,341 --> 00:16:13,641
Anyone who tries to stop me will have their
throat slashed under the name of the king

93
00:16:16,148 --> 00:16:19,311
General, you are still recovering...

94
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,179
Did you know the one I want
to kill the most...

95
00:16:24,223 --> 00:16:25,155
...is you.

96
00:16:44,076 --> 00:16:45,441
Why doesn't anyone stop the General?

97
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,669
General, come back!

98
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:05,758
You may lead these poor people,
but that doesn't change our situation.

99
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,367
Do you think all of
this happened because of him?

100
00:17:11,637 --> 00:17:16,336
I am not bright enough to know the future.

101
00:17:17,576 --> 00:17:19,771
We should have held onto the General.

102
00:17:21,847 --> 00:17:25,374
The only thing I desire most
is for us all to go home.

103
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:46,402
We must leave!

104
00:17:48,107 --> 00:17:50,098
Your highness, did you have a nightmare?

105
00:17:51,343 --> 00:17:54,244
The fortress is not too far away,
we must leave now.

106
00:17:54,914 --> 00:17:58,179
But your highness, everyone is asleep.

107
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,199
Don't worry too much

108
00:18:18,704 --> 00:18:20,433
He couldn't have gone too far.

109
00:18:22,174 --> 00:18:24,608
Even if he wanted to come back,
his pride will never let him do so.

110
00:18:42,561 --> 00:18:44,495
This is Princess BuYong,
I am being chased by Yuan's soldiers.

111
00:18:44,597 --> 00:18:46,325
I am headed towards the clay fortress.

112
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,092
Send the soldiers there immediately.

113
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:48,929
Wehae!

114
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,074
We will go around the forest.

115
00:18:57,343 --> 00:18:58,401
We cannot sir.

116
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:01,001
If we don't go after them now,
we will lose them in the woods.

117
00:19:01,113 --> 00:19:03,013
Their destination lies at the
end of the woods.

118
00:19:03,515 --> 00:19:08,817
I vowed to return with the Princess.

119
00:19:09,521 --> 00:19:12,547
We are all prepared to die in
the heat of the battle.

120
00:19:15,628 --> 00:19:18,426
The Mongolian are not afraid of death!

121
00:19:18,497 --> 00:19:24,697
Not afraid of death!

122
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,579
Be careful, you carry a child.

123
00:19:41,921 --> 00:19:43,115
Thank you.

124
00:19:43,989 --> 00:19:44,921
You're welcome.

125
00:19:47,026 --> 00:19:47,856
Daejung!

126
00:19:59,838 --> 00:20:01,169
How are the wounds?

127
00:20:01,974 --> 00:20:03,373
The poison in his body is almost neutraliZed.

128
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:09,570
- Why aren't you helping the general up?
- It is not necessary! I can get up by myself!

129
00:20:10,816 --> 00:20:12,443
General, get up...

130
00:20:14,753 --> 00:20:16,687
Do not call me a General anymore.

131
00:20:19,425 --> 00:20:22,360
Regardless of what you say,
you are still a general.

132
00:20:23,829 --> 00:20:25,956
You've led this group well.
Please come with us.

133
00:20:29,368 --> 00:20:30,300
Come with me.

134
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,896
A well!

135
00:22:19,111 --> 00:22:21,272
Where are all the boats?

136
00:22:21,647 --> 00:22:22,875
Where are Ming's troops?

137
00:22:22,948 --> 00:22:26,315
We came all this way because
of that bitch's words! Now what?

138
00:22:26,985 --> 00:22:28,179
It's not the Princess's fault...

139
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,210
Then whose fault is it?

140
00:22:30,889 --> 00:22:34,086
Was it yours?

141
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:36,784
Stop it! How could any
of us know this would happen?

142
00:22:37,096 --> 00:22:40,224
Yuan's troops will be here soon.
Decide whether we leave or stay.

143
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:45,600
Let's leave this place.

144
00:23:01,053 --> 00:23:02,111
Close the gates!

145
00:23:07,893 --> 00:23:09,451
Go get a bar!

146
00:23:13,398 --> 00:23:14,626
Hurry!

147
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,938
Call a man who can speak Korean.

148
00:23:35,621 --> 00:23:40,524
Listen! For years, Korea has been
the vassal of the great Won Empire.

149
00:23:41,326 --> 00:23:45,490
If you hand over the Princess,
we will let you all live.

150
00:23:45,931 --> 00:23:49,162
Daejung, we are out matched.

151
00:23:49,902 --> 00:23:52,132
The Princess is...

152
00:23:52,271 --> 00:23:53,898
none of our concern anymore.

153
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,611
What they want is me.

154
00:24:03,448 --> 00:24:05,609
You have kept your promise,
you have escorted me here.

155
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:09,319
There is no need for anymore
sacrifices for me.

156
00:24:10,222 --> 00:24:12,053
If you refuse to hand her over,

157
00:24:12,191 --> 00:24:14,022
we will destroy you all!

158
00:24:15,827 --> 00:24:17,317
Daejung, you must decide.

159
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:21,266
Help us.

160
00:24:26,371 --> 00:24:27,702
Huh? The gates are opening.

161
00:24:48,827 --> 00:24:50,488
So the great fighter is still alive.

162
00:24:53,432 --> 00:24:56,094
He ruined everything!

163
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:20,690
Those who wish to leave may do so.

164
00:25:33,405 --> 00:25:36,306
Honey, honey!

165
00:25:50,255 --> 00:25:52,723
Pitch the tents. We will prepare for battle.

166
00:25:56,495 --> 00:25:58,690
Father!

167
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:12,036
Why the hell did you do that?

168
00:26:47,612 --> 00:26:53,573
Daejung, I found the bamboos you wanted.

169
00:26:56,621 --> 00:27:00,216
Hey! Get away, get away!

170
00:27:05,364 --> 00:27:06,797
You still look pale.

171
00:27:08,266 --> 00:27:10,200
It's alright, I wanna help you.

172
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:12,263
Water! Come get some!

173
00:27:12,371 --> 00:27:16,637
We have water here!

174
00:27:16,975 --> 00:27:20,942
We have water!
I'm so happy!

175
00:27:21,078 --> 00:27:22,239
 

176
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:37,021
They are going to strike quickly.

177
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:41,922
First, they will attack the gate.
Then they'll surround us and climb in.

178
00:27:43,301 --> 00:27:45,735
We have no defenses here.

179
00:27:50,675 --> 00:27:52,700
General, please lead us.

180
00:27:56,648 --> 00:27:58,445
I don't want to become a fool again.

181
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:02,183
Everyone knows why Koreans are
outstanding in defense of castles.

182
00:28:02,654 --> 00:28:05,646
It is because they had excellent leaders.

183
00:28:09,761 --> 00:28:10,887
General!

184
00:28:19,938 --> 00:28:21,235
I will fight by myself.

185
00:28:22,841 --> 00:28:24,536
I was the one who made us head to Korea.

186
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,278
I made us save the Princess...
I started this all.

187
00:28:28,346 --> 00:28:31,076
Whether we go home or not,
fight for your name...

188
00:28:31,149 --> 00:28:32,582
This is the time for all of us to unite.

189
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:35,847
It is none of your business.

190
00:28:37,923 --> 00:28:39,083
This is my war.

191
00:28:46,298 --> 00:28:50,166
Distribute liquor to the soldiers and
let them sleep until the sun is fully up.

192
00:28:50,569 --> 00:28:53,629
We have to capture the Princess
and return to the base as soon as possible.

193
00:28:54,072 --> 00:28:57,371
For the past three months,
we haven't had a single day's peace.

194
00:28:58,243 --> 00:29:00,575
We need to attack them quickly!
What if Ming's troops come...

195
00:29:00,879 --> 00:29:04,576
Only two people know were are here.
Us, and them.

196
00:29:06,318 --> 00:29:09,287
How many of us will survive?

197
00:29:11,756 --> 00:29:12,745
stay with me.

198
00:29:14,626 --> 00:29:18,562
Wow! Thank you brother.

199
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:21,790
It is relatively safe at the coast and sides
of the castle. We need to protect the front.

200
00:29:22,601 --> 00:29:25,069
Monk, take care of the Princess
and the elderly people.

201
00:29:25,604 --> 00:29:27,037
The Interpreter and I will
take care the front gate.

202
00:29:27,405 --> 00:29:28,963
You and Dochoong in the east

203
00:29:29,207 --> 00:29:32,665
- Yeosol and HA-Il will protect in the west....
- Dochoong and I will cover the east

204
00:29:35,847 --> 00:29:37,678
what about me, sir?

205
00:29:38,984 --> 00:29:40,281
Dansaeng has something for you to do.

206
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,411
Don't come out, never! You hear?

207
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,888
Stay there.

208
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:52,053
You'll be in big trouble
if you make one move.

209
00:29:52,297 --> 00:29:53,889
Don't come out...

210
00:29:55,967 --> 00:29:56,729
Pull!

211
00:30:02,874 --> 00:30:04,999
Whoa, you've made a ton of
spears haven't you.

212
00:30:06,611 --> 00:30:08,442
Huh? They start to move...

213
00:30:46,151 --> 00:30:49,018
Dochoong, don't shoot your arrows
without my signal!

214
00:30:50,422 --> 00:30:52,151
Wait until they come closer!

215
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,201
Shoot!

216
00:31:19,684 --> 00:31:22,983
Yuan's troops are coming!

217
00:31:29,394 --> 00:31:30,827
Sit down!

218
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,732
Cut the ropes!

219
00:32:24,883 --> 00:32:26,544
Attack!!

220
00:32:38,196 --> 00:32:42,132
Don't retreat! Keep your place!!

221
00:32:45,837 --> 00:32:48,135
Use your shields!
Break the fortress gate! Go!

222
00:33:04,689 --> 00:33:06,657
Daejung, Hurry up!

223
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:25,267
General, the messenger has arrived!

224
00:34:07,685 --> 00:34:09,277
Stop the attack.

225
00:34:47,692 --> 00:34:49,887
We received orders to withdraw? Shit!

226
00:34:50,328 --> 00:34:52,353
What the hell? We're about to win!

227
00:34:59,804 --> 00:35:01,738
Kill them all!

228
00:35:01,973 --> 00:35:07,240
Saori... Saori!

229
00:35:41,045 --> 00:35:44,776
Look over there..,
A white flag at Yuan's side.

230
00:35:47,051 --> 00:35:48,814
It is to mourn the death
of someone in high position.

231
00:35:49,821 --> 00:35:52,153
If they attack again...

232
00:35:53,691 --> 00:35:55,215
We don't have a chance at
holding them back.

233
00:35:58,329 --> 00:36:00,593
General! Why did you
order us to withdraw?

234
00:36:01,132 --> 00:36:02,565
Dig deep wells in the middle of the hill.

235
00:36:03,201 --> 00:36:04,691
We were almost at victory!

236
00:36:07,505 --> 00:36:09,097
Cookoo has passed away...

237
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:12,304
Right after we left headquarters.

238
00:36:15,513 --> 00:36:19,313
We will hold a memorial ceremony first.
Then we will resume our attack.

239
00:36:30,061 --> 00:36:31,790
Why did you leave your post?

240
00:36:32,363 --> 00:36:35,093
Because of you, so 
many people died!

241
00:36:59,524 --> 00:37:02,857
Stop your god damn chanting!

242
00:37:12,203 --> 00:37:16,936
Please stop crying.
We've beaten the enemy.

243
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:23,169
You family has been loyal
to the Ming empire...

244
00:37:23,648 --> 00:37:24,580
for that the Emperor will reward you greatly.

245
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,014
Reward?!

246
00:37:27,185 --> 00:37:31,178
You dragged us to die here!

247
00:37:31,622 --> 00:37:34,455
First my husband, now my daughter!

248
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:37,824
How dare you speak like
that to the Princess!

249
00:37:37,962 --> 00:37:40,624
You go! Then, we're all safe!

250
00:37:40,765 --> 00:37:44,496
Because of you, we're all
going to die like dogs!

251
00:38:17,101 --> 00:38:18,125
Byuljang!

252
00:38:27,145 --> 00:38:28,874
What the hell are they doing?

253
00:38:35,019 --> 00:38:36,611
The water channel is blocked

254
00:38:39,757 --> 00:38:41,486
Everything will be over by tomorrow

255
00:38:55,473 --> 00:38:59,375
Cookoo started a losing war.

256
00:39:00,511 --> 00:39:02,479
The dreams of the great Ghengis Khan

257
00:39:03,781 --> 00:39:07,649
have faded away forever.

258
00:39:11,189 --> 00:39:12,816
Don't say that. Your words hold

259
00:39:13,091 --> 00:39:15,423
great influence over the fighting sprit.

260
00:39:18,596 --> 00:39:20,029
Let us return to the prairies.

261
00:39:20,965 --> 00:39:22,364
You mean we should just leave like this?

262
00:39:24,769 --> 00:39:25,929
No...the Princess will be with us.

263
00:39:30,675 --> 00:39:32,336
The children are waiting for you.

264
00:39:34,445 --> 00:39:36,072
Why are they looking for me?

265
00:39:37,248 --> 00:39:39,341
I have no business with them, right?

266
00:39:50,161 --> 00:39:52,595
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

267
00:39:53,998 --> 00:39:54,794
You told me

268
00:39:56,234 --> 00:39:59,328
that I was irresponsible, didn't you?

269
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:02,637
You were right.

270
00:40:04,675 --> 00:40:09,009
I'm just a coward...a coward.

271
00:40:11,182 --> 00:40:14,709
In this situation, it is more difficult
for one not to fight than to fight.

272
00:40:16,454 --> 00:40:20,151
If you disagree to useless cruelty,
keep your conviction.

273
00:40:21,459 --> 00:40:23,620
Don't you think that is also courage?

274
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:26,426
At one time,

275
00:40:27,999 --> 00:40:30,627
I was a student of Confucianism,
dreaming of the righteous world.

276
00:40:32,803 --> 00:40:35,294
But for a countryman like me,

277
00:40:36,374 --> 00:40:39,207
I was not even given the chance to
apply for a position of a government official.

278
00:40:41,179 --> 00:40:42,407
That is why I joined this journey.

279
00:40:44,248 --> 00:40:47,411
No one else wanted to go.

280
00:40:47,552 --> 00:40:50,487
I had to create an opportunity.

281
00:40:54,792 --> 00:40:57,556
I always end up on the short end...why?

282
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,999
Pray for a hundred days to Buddha.

283
00:41:05,203 --> 00:41:07,171
He will help you.

284
00:41:10,241 --> 00:41:12,004
Does it really work?

285
00:41:14,078 --> 00:41:15,739
Y should go to the children.

286
00:41:17,448 --> 00:41:18,915
She is giving birth!

287
00:41:24,222 --> 00:41:26,554
We need hot water...
What shall we do?

288
00:41:27,592 --> 00:41:29,526
We don't even have drinking water.

289
00:41:29,694 --> 00:41:31,059
What the hell you guys all doing here?

290
00:41:31,862 --> 00:41:34,092
Get out, get out!

291
00:41:48,314 --> 00:41:50,212
Isn't that Dansaeng?
Where is he going?

292
00:41:50,315 --> 00:41:53,112
That son of bitch...
He is out of mind!

293
00:41:53,217 --> 00:41:54,309
Dansaeng!

294
00:41:54,518 --> 00:41:55,576
Call everyone over.

295
00:41:55,886 --> 00:41:57,319
I'll go and get him.

296
00:41:57,855 --> 00:41:59,447
What can we do?

297
00:42:16,874 --> 00:42:18,774
Shit! Be careful!

298
00:42:21,312 --> 00:42:25,146
There are thieves!

299
00:42:27,285 --> 00:42:29,845
General, two men
stole water from our well.

300
00:43:06,557 --> 00:43:07,785
What about Dansaeng?
Where is he?

301
00:43:08,693 --> 00:43:10,058
Uh? He was right behind me!

302
00:43:11,762 --> 00:43:12,956
Where is he? Uh, over there!

303
00:43:13,464 --> 00:43:14,761
Dansaeng!

304
00:43:17,134 --> 00:43:18,066
Dansaeng get up!

305
00:43:18,235 --> 00:43:19,202
Give me that.

306
00:43:19,403 --> 00:43:20,267
Dochoong

307
00:43:21,872 --> 00:43:22,861
Throw the fire.

308
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,737
- Dansaeng!
- Hurry!

309
00:43:31,949 --> 00:43:34,850
- Hurry!
- Run! Run!

310
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,186
- Almost...
- Climb up!

311
00:43:38,689 --> 00:43:39,519
Get the rope!

312
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:41,421
Climb up! Climb up!

313
00:43:44,662 --> 00:43:45,822
Dansaeng!

314
00:43:46,897 --> 00:43:48,364
Hurry up!

315
00:43:48,532 --> 00:43:49,328
Wait!

316
00:43:51,001 --> 00:43:53,128
What the hell he's doing?!

317
00:43:54,672 --> 00:43:56,572
Dansaeng, come back!

318
00:43:56,741 --> 00:43:57,833
Come on. Hurry up!

319
00:44:10,388 --> 00:44:11,320
Get this one first!

320
00:44:12,923 --> 00:44:14,322
Hurry up!

321
00:44:15,326 --> 00:44:19,990
Pretty clever...
Do you want to try?

322
00:44:31,776 --> 00:44:33,403
Dansaeng. That's alright...
Give me your hand.

323
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:44,617
No!!!

324
00:45:06,377 --> 00:45:07,503
Dansaeng

325
00:45:50,454 --> 00:45:54,288
Shit...Stop crying.

326
00:45:54,825 --> 00:45:56,087
Let him cry.

327
00:46:07,104 --> 00:46:10,039
How dare you come here, huh?

328
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:13,677
You want to kill us all?

329
00:46:13,811 --> 00:46:14,175
Dochoong!

330
00:46:14,278 --> 00:46:17,975
Give me back my eye!
Give it to me!

331
00:46:18,082 --> 00:46:18,514
 

332
00:46:18,983 --> 00:46:20,814
You told us you would give us a boat,
didn't you?

333
00:46:21,018 --> 00:46:23,418
What good is the Princess of the Ming Empire
when she can't even get us a small boat!!

334
00:46:23,554 --> 00:46:26,079
Your words brought us here.

335
00:46:26,223 --> 00:46:29,021
where is the damned boat?!

336
00:46:32,096 --> 00:46:36,726
Why did you hit me? Why??

337
00:46:37,001 --> 00:46:38,730
Why the hell did you hit me?

338
00:46:38,802 --> 00:46:42,260
Then, hit me! Hit me more!

339
00:46:42,573 --> 00:46:43,938
Don't blame the Princess,

340
00:46:45,609 --> 00:46:47,076
Everything was my decision.

341
00:46:47,578 --> 00:46:49,045
The general will take responsibility?

342
00:46:51,382 --> 00:46:53,373
How can you take responsibility 
for a situation like this?

343
00:46:53,484 --> 00:46:56,351
We just have to send the Princess out
alone - why can't we do that!?

344
00:46:56,453 --> 00:46:57,147
Why?!

345
00:46:57,254 --> 00:47:00,314
Why don't you just sent her out?!

346
00:47:00,391 --> 00:47:00,720
That's enough...

347
00:47:00,791 --> 00:47:02,349
Let me go, you son of a bitch!

348
00:47:09,099 --> 00:47:11,795
Someone has to tell the
Princess about this!

349
00:47:12,069 --> 00:47:13,161
Shut up!

350
00:47:13,337 --> 00:47:17,273
Daejung! Don't stop them...
It's better them to say what's on their minds.

351
00:47:18,108 --> 00:47:20,906
General, what are they talking about?

352
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:26,013
You are all cowards.

353
00:47:27,718 --> 00:47:29,549
Then let's just cut the Princess's head off.

354
00:47:31,455 --> 00:47:32,444
You keep out of this.

355
00:47:32,923 --> 00:47:35,391
If we hang her head outside the fortress
wall, they might turn back.

356
00:47:35,859 --> 00:47:37,258
If you all wish, I'll do that.

357
00:47:49,206 --> 00:47:50,400
Interpreter, what's Yeesol saying?

358
00:47:51,475 --> 00:47:54,535
I order you to tell me!

359
00:47:55,346 --> 00:47:58,873
That you should be sent to the enemy.

360
00:47:59,149 --> 00:47:59,808
Shut your mouth!

361
00:48:00,584 --> 00:48:03,018
You want me to tell her
what he really said?

362
00:48:22,139 --> 00:48:24,801
Do you understand how much
your words hurt her?

363
00:48:26,076 --> 00:48:28,772
I only came all the way here for her.

364
00:48:30,581 --> 00:48:32,742
Never wish for something
you can never get.

365
00:48:33,917 --> 00:48:35,248
Don't forget you are a slave.

366
00:48:37,721 --> 00:48:39,621
Have you ever heard of the slave,
Manjuk?

367
00:48:41,225 --> 00:48:43,022
He said, 'People are all the equal.'

368
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,690
Are Kings of different blood
than any of us?

369
00:48:45,996 --> 00:48:48,123
After saying those words, he was beheaded.

370
00:48:50,367 --> 00:48:53,268
Whoever aims at my neck
will have their arm cut off first.

371
00:48:59,777 --> 00:49:01,472
My sword carries no mercy.

372
00:49:04,782 --> 00:49:05,646
Do you want a match?

373
00:49:45,889 --> 00:49:49,552
Too many have died already, too many...

374
00:49:51,261 --> 00:49:53,092
Now you want us to kill each other?

375
00:50:18,856 --> 00:50:22,952
That is the last time you interfere.
I don't need your help any longer.

376
00:50:41,779 --> 00:50:44,339
It's a boy!

377
00:51:03,834 --> 00:51:06,496
Your highness. Please.
Bless this child

378
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:11,036
for luck and health.

379
00:51:17,948 --> 00:51:19,609
What are you doing here?

380
00:51:19,817 --> 00:51:20,909
Do you want him to freeze?

381
00:51:20,984 --> 00:51:23,316
- She only cares for herself.
- She doesn't deserve to hold the child...

382
00:51:23,487 --> 00:51:25,717
Hurry and take the child inside,

383
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,791
Before he catches cold.

384
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:37,565
Your highness...

385
00:51:39,236 --> 00:51:40,635
Your highness...

386
00:51:40,904 --> 00:51:41,734
Please forgive me.

387
00:51:44,675 --> 00:51:45,539
Bring me a horse.

388
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:49,875
I am leaving this fortress.

389
00:52:05,162 --> 00:52:10,190
Stop this, your highness.
You are what we are fighting for.

390
00:52:10,901 --> 00:52:14,098
Don't you see that everybody wants
me to leave as soon as possible?

391
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:19,507
As the Princess of the Great Ming Empire,
I will end this war with my own hands.

392
00:52:20,077 --> 00:52:23,945
Your highness,
please don't go...Please.

393
00:52:24,047 --> 00:52:25,480
Do you want me to take
my own life right here?

394
00:52:27,818 --> 00:52:29,445
No one may step forward.

395
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,114
I will go by myself.

396
00:52:34,224 --> 00:52:35,418
General...

397
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:37,154
Get out of my way.

398
00:52:43,767 --> 00:52:46,759
The Koreans won't give up,
your highness.

399
00:52:47,437 --> 00:52:48,597
Please trust me!

400
00:52:50,774 --> 00:52:52,071
How dare you block me?

401
00:53:59,142 --> 00:54:01,702
Let us wait...
they are coming towards us.

402
00:54:16,793 --> 00:54:17,851
You can't go.

403
00:55:47,617 --> 00:55:49,278
Will you watch guard
outside the fortress?

404
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:58,142
Kill him!

405
00:57:58,215 --> 00:57:59,045
Wait.

406
00:58:12,562 --> 00:58:14,325
Let him pick up his sword.

407
00:58:40,757 --> 00:58:42,554
What happened to the others?

408
00:58:45,996 --> 00:58:46,758
What about Yeesol?

409
00:58:58,942 --> 00:59:00,466
Just stay where you are.

410
00:59:05,515 --> 00:59:08,075
Daejung, Daejung

411
00:59:11,388 --> 00:59:13,288
You can't move sir, not now.

412
00:59:15,058 --> 00:59:16,082
Stay still.

413
01:00:18,254 --> 01:00:19,619
The royal castle was too suffocating...

414
01:00:21,157 --> 01:00:23,387
I thought that if I left
there I would be free.

415
01:00:25,562 --> 01:00:27,291
This is all my fault.

416
01:00:31,067 --> 01:00:32,159
I'm so scared.

417
01:00:37,507 --> 01:00:39,475
I don't think I can bear it any longer.

418
01:00:42,445 --> 01:00:43,969
Neither can I.
I'm nothing but a cowward.

419
01:00:46,483 --> 01:00:48,246
I was always afraid...

420
01:00:51,654 --> 01:00:53,121
...that people would notice that.

421
01:00:57,026 --> 01:00:59,119
I do not deserve being called General.

422
01:01:05,902 --> 01:01:07,130
Everyone come here!

423
01:01:20,049 --> 01:01:21,277
Is he dead?

424
01:01:24,621 --> 01:01:25,713
Wait, he's moving...

425
01:01:31,895 --> 01:01:34,830
I'm not sure how long he's got.

426
01:01:41,304 --> 01:01:43,932
General,
what is the meaning of this?

427
01:01:44,707 --> 01:01:47,801
When they open the gate doors
to rescue him, we'll rush them.

428
01:01:48,178 --> 01:01:52,410
If they decide not to come for him,
we keep their best warrior.

429
01:02:06,029 --> 01:02:07,963
Is anyone going to save him?

430
01:02:12,802 --> 01:02:15,396
- I'll go down to get him.
- General...

431
01:02:15,872 --> 01:02:17,999
if we open the door now
we'll all die.

432
01:02:18,174 --> 01:02:19,539
It's a trap.

433
01:02:20,477 --> 01:02:22,035
So you're saying we stand
back and do nothing?

434
01:02:44,467 --> 01:02:45,866
That's the only way.

435
01:02:46,202 --> 01:02:47,829
It is better for him to die
quickly by our own hand.

436
01:02:48,071 --> 01:02:49,060
Should I throw the torch?

437
01:02:52,208 --> 01:02:53,197
The moonlight is bright enough.

438
01:02:58,548 --> 01:02:59,344
Daejung... Daejung

439
01:03:10,793 --> 01:03:11,760
Don't shoot.

440
01:03:14,898 --> 01:03:16,525
You like him too, don't you?

441
01:03:33,583 --> 01:03:34,277
Daejung.

442
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:43,149
Do you still consider me General?

443
01:03:49,566 --> 01:03:51,557
I want to lead the battle tomorrow.

444
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:03,444
Up till now,
we have gone through so much.

445
01:04:05,415 --> 01:04:07,349
It is a miracle
that we've made it this far.

446
01:04:09,319 --> 01:04:10,479
I remember

447
01:04:10,887 --> 01:04:13,219
an old Chinese proverb - 

448
01:04:14,524 --> 01:04:17,800
'If we attempt to live, we die,
if we attempt to die, we live.'

449
01:04:18,728 --> 01:04:20,389
Let us trust each other and unite.

450
01:04:22,231 --> 01:04:24,529
Even if we all die...

451
01:04:39,515 --> 01:04:41,983
Tomorrow they will break
through the gate and enter.

452
01:04:42,685 --> 01:04:45,654
When they come in
we will use these bombs.

453
01:04:46,990 --> 01:04:48,480
Be careful.

454
01:04:48,958 --> 01:04:49,617
Come here...

455
01:05:11,714 --> 01:05:15,081
Everyone, stand up.

456
01:05:28,231 --> 01:05:30,222
Tomorrow,
we will protect you, your highness.

457
01:05:55,158 --> 01:05:57,217
Do you wish to become
a general in the Yuan Empire?

458
01:05:59,395 --> 01:06:03,593
I am a free man...kill me.

459
01:06:06,936 --> 01:06:10,702
They never took your
existence seriously.

460
01:06:18,214 --> 01:06:22,241
In order to rebuild the Yuan Empire,
we need courageous warriors like you.

461
01:06:33,229 --> 01:06:53,344
~ the morning mountain home,
white bird sings a song ~

462
01:06:53,549 --> 01:07:00,921
~ I want to hear the song,
wish to go back home ~

463
01:07:01,023 --> 01:07:10,489
~ I want to hear the song,
wish to go back home ~

464
01:07:21,277 --> 01:07:26,146
Sir, you resemble my father
who had passed away.

465
01:07:27,984 --> 01:07:32,546
The Koreans and the Hans look
very much alike. We're like brothers.

466
01:07:32,622 --> 01:07:35,250
We're like brothers.

467
01:07:58,114 --> 01:07:59,500
This has gone on too long...

468
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,416
everyone will die.

469
01:08:04,687 --> 01:08:08,987
Before sunset comes
we return to the prairie.

470
01:08:52,368 --> 01:08:53,266
No, no, wait a minute.

471
01:08:53,903 --> 01:08:55,871
Fire, fire, fire! They're using fire first!

472
01:09:06,182 --> 01:09:07,547
Don't move.

473
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:18,884
Everyone run for cover!

474
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:35,568
General...

475
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:37,776
we've failed.

476
01:09:41,918 --> 01:09:42,646
Daejung....

477
01:09:53,930 --> 01:09:55,761
Let us have an honorable death.

478
01:10:00,836 --> 01:10:02,963
That is my wish.

479
01:11:25,521 --> 01:11:27,148
Jaosinwe! Jaosinwe!

480
01:12:13,669 --> 01:12:16,229
We must go out and fight together!

481
01:14:47,489 --> 01:14:49,354
Dochoong!

482
01:14:53,929 --> 01:14:55,556
Dochoong...

483
01:16:30,926 --> 01:16:33,656
Protect the Princess
Leave this fortress with her!

484
01:17:07,930 --> 01:17:12,833
So many warriors have died
because of you!

485
01:17:53,075 --> 01:17:55,600
Yesol...

486
01:19:15,324 --> 01:19:19,055
My son...

487
01:20:47,549 --> 01:20:48,573
It's too dangerous

488
01:20:50,319 --> 01:20:52,514
You cannot cross the sea with that boat.

489
01:20:54,289 --> 01:20:56,951
I must go.

490
01:22:10,932 --> 01:22:25,176
Only those who have a long journey
will see the long roads to go home
