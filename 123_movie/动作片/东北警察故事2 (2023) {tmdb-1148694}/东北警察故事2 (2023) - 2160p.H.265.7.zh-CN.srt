1
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:17,368
The is chu-tu, in his late 40s

2
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,454
night club owner,

3
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,374
trader and realtor

4
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,209
All his business

5
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,128
are losing money

6
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,381
How are things up there?

7
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,384
This in Mad Wing, his body-guard

8
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,096
these are all

9
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,931
his hit-men

10
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:41,809
take care, see you at the Dye Factory

11
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:43,978
Wait for me up there

12
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,187
OK

13
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,573
This Danny Chu, his nephew

14
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,783
Always has an army hanging around him

15
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:01,037
this is John Ko, Chu tu's brain

16
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,332
this is Salina Fong

17
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,000
Only been hanging

18
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,918
around Chu recently

19
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,546
Does she know everything about Chu yet?

20
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,382
Well, it's difficult to tell

21
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,013
Our objective

22
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,641
is to take them all in

23
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:25,770
Our code is Operation Roar Hung

24
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,521
Understand?

25
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:28,856
Yes

26
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,900
Read what's inside your envelope

27
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,235
Each one has his own instructions

28
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,039
Remember by heart and
destroy the written orders

29
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,625
Each man does his own job

30
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,837
Hurry, come on

31
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,317
Attention,

32
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,361
this is t.O.C. headquarters

33
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,029
Operation begins at once

34
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,879
I'll get you a tea

35
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,134
two teas please

36
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:21,427
OK

37
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,191
I'll come for them later

38
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:39,987
A guy looks suspicious here

39
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,157
two teas please

40
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,367
Signal them below, I'm going down

41
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,418
Kim

42
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,961
One for me?

43
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:56,962
We've been discovered

44
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,088
What?

45
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,007
Follow the one in red shirt and white pants

46
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,063
What's up?

47
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:14,855
I'm Salina,

48
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,148
Kueng said there're a suspicious guy

49
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,691
What's up with you?

50
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,692
I'm a cop

51
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,152
Cop, help

52
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,403
Cop?

53
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,168
Freeze, I'm a cop

54
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,214
I heard shooting

55
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,423
they opened fire

56
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,216
now what?

57
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,676
Let's scatter the bystanders first

58
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,386
We're cops. Go

59
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,267
Special Corps over, what happened?

60
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,519
I'm a cop, don't stay here

61
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,688
Go

62
00:05:58,984 --> 00:05:59,775
Here

63
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,862
Attention, watch out for
the civilians, explosives

64
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,238
Careful of kids

65
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,031
Hurry, run, kid

66
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,367
Hurry, run

67
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:16,709
this way

68
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,515
You all go give a hand

69
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,766
We have orders to stay

70
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,184
You must improvise for the situation

71
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:35,603
Go

72
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:47,907
Let me go

73
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,199
It'll get tighter when you move

74
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:50,993
Let me go

75
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,215
I've got this covered. You can leave

76
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:06,634
Quick, cover the boss

77
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:07,760
Go on

78
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,905
there's a girl suspect
up there, take her back

79
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,037
It's me

80
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,250
How come?

81
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:41,585
Don't ask

82
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,424
Calm down

83
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:02,815
Help me...

84
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,400
tak, tak

85
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:05,943
Cover me

86
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:30,804
tak, tak

87
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,933
Be cool

88
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,021
It hurts

89
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,528
Help me

90
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,113
take care of him there

91
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,005
they've got a lot of guns

92
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,800
Watch out for the villagers,

93
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,510
that's our order

94
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,679
Have they told the crooks too?

95
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,347
Who told you to be a cop?

96
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,557
Come here

97
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,439
Watch out Ka Kui, they're fearless

98
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,586
Over here

99
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,467
Get in

100
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,263
Get away

101
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,057
Get back, get back

102
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,438
no

103
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:07,648
What?

104
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:08,732
It is blocked up there, move back

105
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,442
Move back

106
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:13,403
Can't, go back up

107
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,030
It is blocked below, go up

108
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,824
We're stuck, boss, now what?

109
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,659
We fight our way down

110
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,119
Let's go

111
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,359
Boss, Hurry

112
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:48,916
Hurry

113
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:50,751
Let's go this way

114
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,556
Freeze

115
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,228
Watch out for the pedestrians

116
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,562
Where have you been?

117
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,939
This is your station

118
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,232
I went up to help

119
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,108
Who gave you orders, they're gone now

120
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,319
What do you mean by that?

121
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,580
Hurry, go

122
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,167
Excuse me

123
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,127
tell them to get down, out of the way

124
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:35,170
Get down

125
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,213
Don't let them see my face

126
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,256
tell the driver to step on it

127
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,340
Step on it

128
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,265
Get down

129
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:31,893
turn here, turn

130
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,319
Make a run for it!

131
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,571
Make a run

132
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,167
Easy, boss, we'll make it

133
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,418
Look

134
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,720
Go, take care of him

135
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,264
tell the driver to step on it

136
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:24,529
Hurry down

137
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:39,878
turn quickly down the hill

138
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,541
Are you nuts? Right in
the middle of the road

139
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,459
Move over, I'm a cop

140
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,840
He is right in front

141
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:26,258
Run him over

142
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,050
Yes

143
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,593
Step on it, run him over

144
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,351
Don't be scared

145
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,299
Don't move

146
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,262
You're under arrest

147
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:16,808
Let me go, and this is yours

148
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,274
Once in a life time,

149
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,068
no one will know

150
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,615
Smart guy

151
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,034
Don't move

152
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,586
Good show, isn't it?

153
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,298
Be modest when he praises you later

154
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,258
Don't let it get to you

155
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,054
You better tell Ka Kui

156
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,223
I didn't do it by myself

157
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,892
I acted according to orders

158
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,685
that's fine

159
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,687
Don't forget this line later

160
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,022
when Raymond comes

161
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,732
He must be happy to hear that

162
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,322
Operation Boar Hunt

163
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:13,615
is a carefully planned jolt

164
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:14,908
Didn't you

165
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,034
cover every side?

166
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,328
The prime suspect almost got away

167
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:20,580
Didn't Chou give you

168
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,748
clear orders?

169
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,458
Yes, he said...

170
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,794
we were under good leadership

171
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,045
What?

172
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,839
The job was carefully planned

173
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,967
But our execution had a few flows

174
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,635
Why were there flaws?

175
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:35,512
Must be before

176
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:36,721
we got to the store

177
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,598
Ka Kui couldn't handle the secretary

178
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,016
And she created a mess

179
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:41,810
How could Chu tu get away?

180
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,311
This was your spot

181
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:44,688
What do you mean by that?

182
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,982
It's no time to point your finger

183
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,484
What is it?

184
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,527
The PR madam is here

185
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:51,820
Ask her in

186
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,158
the press is here, inspector Lee

187
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,785
What press? tell them no comment

188
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,329
Look, I asked them here

189
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,039
tell them to wait

190
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,834
Ka Kui, you'll be our speaker

191
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,086
Me? no, no

192
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,879
the speech has been written,

193
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,298
just read it

194
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,425
Go learn it with Madam

195
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,552
You can go now, Man

196
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,053
YES SIR

197
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,102
the superiors are pleased

198
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,021
with Ka Kui

199
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,689
they see a lot in him

200
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:29,482
take him to do

201
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,526
a recruiting poster later

202
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,821
Arrange to have him on our tV program etc

203
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,156
An example of the force

204
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,992
the superiors see him as a model cop

205
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,827
He can handle that easily

206
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,997
What are the charges on Chu's secretary

207
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:47,125
Drug trafficking, resisting arrest

208
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,878
Drop all charges

209
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,963
Drop all charges?

210
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,511
You played a big part, Sergeant Chan

211
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:01,890
Our superiors' leadership

212
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,725
accounts for the success

213
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:04,976
Good job

214
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,978
Will you be promoted?

215
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:08,980
We don't fight crime

216
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,024
for promotion

217
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,777
Our superiors take care
of promotion matters

218
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,112
Chu tu tried to bribe you
with millions, right?

219
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:17,322
With that money,

220
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,866
he could buy the whole force

221
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,118
Just kidding, don't put it down

222
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,787
Please sit closer

223
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:26,831
What's up?

224
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,541
Just saying hi

225
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:29,918
Don't sit so close

226
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,379
We two

227
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:36,966
Let's do it this way

228
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,218
- Understand? - Yes

229
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,095
Start

230
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,691
Straighten up

231
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,567
Open you eyes

232
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,027
Open your mouth

233
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,362
Wider

234
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,863
Wider still

235
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,534
Forget it, just be yourself

236
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,411
Be natural

237
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,287
Ready

238
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,833
the handcuffs in the middle

239
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,751
Smoother action

240
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,935
Your way wouldn't work

241
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,353
Why not?

242
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,480
She's Chu's secretary,

243
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,858
won't cooperate

244
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,485
If Chu knows

245
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,321
she'll be our witness

246
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:41,948
What would he do?

247
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,285
He would stop her

248
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,579
appearance in court

249
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,458
Our man who covers her would be in danger

250
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,504
Don't be a cop

251
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,631
if you want to live to 100

252
00:20:58,883 --> 00:20:59,966
You want this line

253
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,260
on the recruiting poster?

254
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,553
We don't have enough

255
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:04,804
to prosecute Chu

256
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,639
We must push him

257
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:07,974
into a corner

258
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,893
Let him make a mistake

259
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,227
I suggest a man

260
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:12,270
to protect our lady witness

261
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,606
I have someone in mind already

262
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,983
Are we thinking of the same man?

263
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,616
Good luck to him

264
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,244
Why only you free on bail?

265
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,789
Lucky you

266
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:35,960
they are to see Inspector Lee

267
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:39,130
Please wait

268
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:41,299
You can go after seeing the inspector

269
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,764
You can go in now

270
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,557
thanks

271
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:56,439
Please sit down

272
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,945
You can go now, Miss Fong

273
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,281
Wait, before you go

274
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,534
Keep this subpoena

275
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,035
to appear in court

276
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:12,038
What is the charge?

277
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,081
There are no charges

278
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:15,917
You'll be our witness

279
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,712
Sorry, my client isn't prepared to do so

280
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,340
We are not asking her permission

281
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,968
She is required by law to do it

282
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,265
Officer Chan

283
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:31,015
YES SIR

284
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,350
You're attached to Miss Fong from now on,

285
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:33,852
24 hours a day

286
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,144
Until she appears in court

287
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,105
Me

288
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:37,981
You don't like it

289
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,023
Yes I do

290
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,608
I don't need his protection

291
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,444
You can't refuse

292
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,282
Officer Chan

293
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:48,157
YES SIR

294
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,577
You must know as an escort of the witness

295
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,246
that the witness

296
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,622
is constantly in danger

297
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,332
Of threat, assault, and disturbance

298
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,126
Or irritated by the intentions of such

299
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,670
It is your duty to see to that

300
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,631
Her safety and personal rights

301
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,258
are intact

302
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:06,718
Yes

303
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:07,719
But can someone else go

304
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,096
You'll get a bonus

305
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,472
for the duty

306
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,099
$32.80 per day

307
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,893
It's an old tradition,

308
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,561
unchanged for years

309
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,105
Bring your own money, that's all

310
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:22,859
Can we talk to you alone?

311
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,277
I refuse to have my client

312
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,487
interrogated alone

313
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:27,697
this is not an interrogation

314
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:28,948
Just a few hints

315
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,034
for her benefit

316
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,750
You can refuse them

317
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:41,044
Let's hear what they've to say

318
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:43,963
Mr. Counselor, please excuse us

319
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:47,675
Remember,

320
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,427
any questions concerning this case

321
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,305
Or anything else, you can keep quiet

322
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:58,603
What are you standing here for?

323
00:23:58,854 --> 00:23:59,812
I have to go out too?

324
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,648
You've got high rank?

325
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,025
You said you had things to say to me

326
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,947
nothing else now, you can go

327
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,618
See you in court

328
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:59,956
they're...

329
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,126
Ka Kui

330
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:04,919
tape it down if possible

331
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,129
OK

332
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,338
What did they say to you?

333
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,340
They didn't say anything

334
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,718
I'm your lawyer, you can trust me

335
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:14,595
they didn't say anything, really

336
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:19,517
Why just her...

337
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,436
Here they are

338
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,023
How about the boss?

339
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:26,899
Can't bail him & the others out

340
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:29,402
What about Salina?

341
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,279
She's their witness now

342
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,780
What? Witness for prosecution

343
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,323
they asked me

344
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:36,325
You'll do it just cause they asked?

345
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:39,328
Please leave the witness alone

346
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:40,997
Who're you?

347
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,373
I'm a cop

348
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,293
I'm her escort

349
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,713
I can charge you for disturbance of peace

350
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,423
Salina

351
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:53,468
You can say so long or good-bye

352
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,595
One more word and you'll be under arrest

353
00:25:58,849 --> 00:25:59,932
I'll take you home

354
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,643
It's my responsibility

355
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,562
I won't say anything

356
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,859
What now, counselor?

357
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,527
I'll see your boss later

358
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,404
OK. Let's go

359
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,992
It's dangerous to roam around,

360
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,410
go home

361
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,245
none of your business

362
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,166
It's for your safety

363
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,961
I don't need you, parasite!

364
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,840
You know what happened
to four of our witnesses

365
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:34,342
who said the same thing

366
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:35,968
What?

367
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,386
They were shot

368
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:40,932
Don't scare me, tell me what happened?

369
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:42,266
Your guess is right

370
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:43,768
they're actually all OK

371
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,394
You have the right to say so

372
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:47,188
that's a threat!

373
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,944
All evidence is against the defendants

374
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:55,154
Only you will fare better

375
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,740
I'm depending on you

376
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,075
I'll do my best,

377
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,827
but be prepared

378
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:02,328
the chance is slim

379
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,122
If I'm discharged,

380
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:05,706
you'll be rewarded

381
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,503
One problem

382
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,132
Salina is going to be their witness

383
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:15,800
Witness for the prosecution

384
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,885
She's been bailed,

385
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,929
now escorted by a cop

386
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,639
the one who nailed you

387
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:28,020
Salina doesn't know much, she's new

388
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,522
that doesn't concern me

389
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,107
She might

390
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,109
surprise us

391
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,112
no

392
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:41,993
Call up Danny

393
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,371
tell him to take care of her

394
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,040
Alright

395
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,087
that's it

396
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,338
Keep the change

397
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,840
For the tea

398
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:02,930
It's dangerous alone

399
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:05,099
I like to see how dangerous

400
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:18,571
John? I'm home

401
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,198
Someone's listening

402
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,327
Let's meet and talk later

403
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,143
I'm scared

404
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,347
You think you can frighten me

405
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:14,729
Help

406
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:26,699
As good as dead

407
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,208
that'll get you

408
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,002
I'm gonna shut you up

409
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,755
You're finished

410
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:47,470
I'll get you

411
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,847
You're finished

412
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:53,893
I'm going to kill you

413
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,187
You're finished

414
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,941
I'll get you

415
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:24,882
Stop running

416
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,762
No escape now

417
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,306
Stop

418
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:33,933
Here...

419
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,314
Here

420
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,275
Well?

421
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,986
No way out

422
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:49,323
Finished

423
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:55,996
I'm here to rescue you

424
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,380
She's terrified, can I quit now?

425
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,758
Yes, you can go anytime

426
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,101
Hold on to him, I'll call the police

427
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,757
I knocked him out, I knocked him out

428
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,094
not yet,

429
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,679
he's still fighting back

430
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,348
Don't come near

431
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:00,019
Go, you can't be here

432
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,312
Don't faint

433
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:02,229
Go

434
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,857
I'll go

435
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:09,653
He passed out

436
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:13,365
no, not totally out

437
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,289
Go, don't faint

438
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,291
Go, go, can't stay

439
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,710
Go

440
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:30,591
Stop acting, go, hurry

441
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:34,136
Let me

442
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,014
He fainted

443
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,059
Yes, for real

444
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,644
One more for safety

445
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:45,731
Don't smash his face,

446
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:46,941
it's for identification

447
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:49,527
no, shouldn't be like this

448
00:33:58,828 --> 00:33:59,954
I don't know him

449
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:02,748
Of course, they'd hire stranger to kill you

450
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,375
Mr. Chu wants me dead?

451
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:08,295
Sure, he's capable of anything

452
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,839
inspector Chou, this is Ka Kui

453
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:13,092
Such a tough case,

454
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:14,510
please send a replacement

455
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:15,886
no

456
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,305
I won't risk my life,

457
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,391
it's just a job

458
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:22,434
I might as well be a mercenary

459
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:25,312
Well, let her take care of herself

460
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:27,565
I'll quit then,

461
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:29,483
never mind

462
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:33,779
Where are you going?

463
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,030
Home

464
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,074
What? Home? You're here to protect me

465
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,409
But you're so uncooperative

466
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,286
How can I work it out?

467
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:43,205
What do you have in mind?

468
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:46,250
No need, I'm quitting

469
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,467
Where's your

470
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,886
sense of duty?

471
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,347
But there's nothing I can do

472
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,308
We'll just die together

473
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,312
I'll cooperate

474
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:09,732
Don't let me talk you into it

475
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,444
Of my own will

476
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:15,112
it'll be safer

477
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,739
at my place

478
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,032
OK. Let's go

479
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:18,991
Like this?

480
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,451
I'll go change

481
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,828
Chu's men will return anytime

482
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,121
I won't change then

483
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,956
Well?

484
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:36,675
What's up?

485
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,260
I'll take a good look

486
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:45,809
Get back in

487
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:47,936
Come out

488
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,070
What are you up to?

489
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:57,946
I'm taking your clothes

490
00:35:58,198 --> 00:35:59,823
I told you to wear them

491
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:01,116
Yes

492
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:02,868
Closer

493
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:11,043
Use my car

494
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,336
All these cars are yours

495
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,254
No, just this one

496
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,639
Why aren't you nervous?

497
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,350
I'm used to this

498
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,270
See, told you to keep quiet

499
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:31,730
What?

500
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,149
My kid

501
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:35,859
Your kid?

502
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,445
Close the door

503
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:23,449
It's me, it's me

504
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,783
My gun...

505
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,083
My gun is in the pocket

506
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,259
Let go

507
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:52,102
Stop running

508
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:02,196
Freeze

509
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,954
take it easy, give me the gun

510
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:11,955
take it easy

511
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,415
Don't come near

512
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,338
Go

513
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,509
Give me the gun

514
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,093
It's me

515
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,565
Are you alright?

516
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:39,817
Where are they?

517
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,735
Don't get trigger happy

518
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,530
Get away quick, this is for real

519
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,826
For real, what was that before?

520
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:50,536
That was real too

521
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,287
But this is more real

522
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,499
that's why you are more nervous

523
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,000
Get in

524
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,012
You are capable of crying too

525
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:11,098
I didn't expect Mr. Chu to do this to me

526
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,058
Don't be naive

527
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:17,187
He is capable of anything

528
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,273
He will make sure you won't be in court

529
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:20,524
What now then

530
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,193
Speak out in court tomorrow

531
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:26,029
Put him in jail and you'll be safe

532
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:27,906
What am I to tell?

533
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:32,703
What business he's in, who's his contact

534
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:34,663
Number of drug deals

535
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,333
Why are you taping all this?

536
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:40,711
Taking notes

537
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,421
When did you start working for him?

538
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:43,922
Four years ago

539
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:47,926
He's a family friend

540
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,846
Mum said he always lent us milk money

541
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:54,224
Now you help him sell drugs

542
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,560
I know very little

543
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,729
Just tell what you know

544
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,318
Anything else you want to add,

545
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,445
tell me later upstairs

546
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:09,197
What I've said is enough
to put him in jail?

547
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:10,616
I'm not the prosecutor

548
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:11,867
But what you're said

549
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,702
will be useful

550
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,753
Come in

551
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,133
I'll turn on the light

552
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,679
HAPPY BIRTHDAY tO YOU

553
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,306
May

554
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,308
I've almost forgotten it's my birthday

555
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:39,895
Are you alright?

556
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,528
Let me introduce, May

557
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,238
this is Miss Fong

558
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,538
Let's go

559
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:00,958
How are you doing?

560
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,210
I'm fine

561
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,045
May

562
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:11,843
Gone? What's the hurry?

563
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:14,930
It's my fault, it was a surprise, right?

564
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,015
And you brought home a girl

565
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,642
dressed like this

566
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:19,935
Who wouldn't be angry?

567
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:22,479
I can be angry too

568
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,897
Didn't even let me explain

569
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,483
Leaving me the whole cake

570
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:27,734
this time I won't forgive her

571
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,361
No matter what

572
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,988
I don't think she will

573
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,159
I knew she'd be back

574
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,290
Happy Birthday

575
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:44,876
Why so happy?

576
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:46,336
Why did May go in rage?

577
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,130
She saw me bringing a girl home

578
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:49,131
that's love,

579
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:50,465
I'll explain it to her

580
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:52,551
no need,

581
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:54,511
ask her to reflect on her faults

582
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:58,306
Have to explain to my boss,

583
00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:00,058
the suspects

584
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,810
I'm sick and tired of explaining

585
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:03,353
Care for a piece of cake

586
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,230
Anything to drink

587
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,606
Orange juice, thanks

588
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:07,899
Help yourself

589
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:17,242
You live by yourself?

590
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,577
A big place!

591
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:19,786
Don't I worry about the ICAC?

592
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:22,039
I share it with a friend, he's on vacation

593
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,582
Sorry

594
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:26,043
Your girlfriend must be mad at me

595
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:27,502
never mind

596
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:31,006
that's part of the job

597
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,803
Come, let's go back

598
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,847
I'll go now

599
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,266
Just like that

600
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:50,358
I might be a movie star

601
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:53,236
Kissing my leading ladies all day

602
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,280
She would have to hang
herself 3 times a day

603
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,453
She's jealous because she loves you

604
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,288
I'll explain it to her if possible

605
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,290
What for? Such a narrow minded kid

606
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:06,875
It'll only spoil her

607
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,502
Aren't you going to say

608
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,003
something nice to her

609
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,838
No chance

610
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,298
If I care to sweet talk,

611
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,801
I could have hundred of girls

612
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:17,260
She'll have to wait for her turn

613
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:23,141
Don't you like her

614
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:26,353
Frankly, yes

615
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:27,854
But that's no reason

616
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:30,315
for me to apologize

617
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,317
I know she's going

618
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,736
to call back to say sorry

619
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,114
What a waste

620
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:49,167
See

621
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,294
Can't wait to get home

622
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,631
Hello

623
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,050
Is it your girlfriend?

624
00:43:57,385 --> 00:44:00,220
Yes, she's speechless with tears

625
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:03,140
Stop crying

626
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:04,766
You should have behaved yourself

627
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,601
What, misunderstanding

628
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:07,978
You might think I'm gay

629
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:08,937
if I escort a man

630
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,857
Go reflect on your faults

631
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:12,858
What

632
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:13,900
Can I explain it to her?

633
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,068
No need

634
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:15,902
Unless you promise

635
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,612
to control your temper

636
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:19,739
Show me respect in front of my friends

637
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,366
Stop crying, bye!

638
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,327
I must teach her a lesson

639
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:37,549
When did she come in?

640
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,135
When you said she would hang herself

641
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:41,970
So you've heard everything

642
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:44,347
the call...

643
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:55,483
that's a dirty trick

644
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:57,903
May, May

645
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:02,866
Listen to me, May

646
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,410
She's our witness under my protection

647
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:06,745
I'm mad at

648
00:45:06,746 --> 00:45:07,787
what you just said

649
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:09,456
You should know I was kidding

650
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,249
Didn't I call first every time

651
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,626
we had a fight

652
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:13,460
But you treat me badly

653
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:14,669
in front of another girl

654
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:16,796
You make me lose face

655
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:18,006
Go away, go away

656
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,799
Listen to me

657
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:21,384
May, listen...

658
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:25,722
Are you alright?

659
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,141
It hurts, go away, happy now?

660
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,143
Happy? It hurts me too

661
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:31,603
I'll get the shoes for you

662
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,563
Put on them first

663
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:36,149
Go away

664
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,275
May, listen to me

665
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,276
No, no

666
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:41,321
Control yourself

667
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:43,156
Listen to me first, OK?

668
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,283
Let go

669
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,163
Be careful

670
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,501
I hate you

671
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:30,662
Where's your girlfriend

672
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:31,955
I accepted her apology,

673
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:35,041
she went home happily

674
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:37,168
What are you doing?

675
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:38,545
Nothing

676
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,923
It hurts

677
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,718
It's breaking, easy

678
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:47,387
It's breaking

679
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,723
What's this ugly thing?

680
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:51,641
Get rid of it

681
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,768
What, this is my precious

682
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:02,360
You got me wet

683
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:04,029
I'll wipe it for you

684
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,741
Oh, no

685
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:10,327
not there, here

686
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:11,953
Here?

687
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:16,875
Easy, you're so rough

688
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:28,345
So uncomfortable on the
sofa, let's go to bed?

689
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,555
OK. Let's go

690
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,265
Where do I sleep?

691
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:33,641
In my bed

692
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:35,018
How about you

693
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:36,728
next to you

694
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:40,857
I like your style

695
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:57,499
I'm going to sleep now

696
00:47:58,667 --> 00:47:59,959
Don't disturb me

697
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:04,589
Women are strange

698
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:21,523
Hi

699
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:22,482
Ka Kui? Wait a second

700
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,067
Uncle Bill, it's him

701
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,320
Hurry Ka Kui, they're waiting at the court

702
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,406
He's out already, may be there's a jam

703
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:32,117
Stop fooling, bring the witness, hurry

704
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:47,924
What was your duty that day?

705
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:49,884
I was observing the squatter huts

706
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:51,428
behind the site

707
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:53,471
there were about a dozen
suspects getting away

708
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:55,223
I arrested the 6th & 7th defendants

709
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:56,433
thank you

710
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,644
Your honor, allow me
to question the witness

711
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:02,272
Mr. Kim

712
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,859
You said you saw a dozen suspects escaping

713
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:07,777
Did all 13 suspects

714
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,654
pass in front of you one by one

715
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:11,781
Or you have a new

716
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,116
electronic device

717
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,868
to enable you to see

718
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,870
all the action at once

719
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:18,830
I object

720
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:19,789
the question played with

721
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,416
the witness's wording

722
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,126
to undermine his credibility

723
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:24,586
Objection overruled

724
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:27,046
thank you, no more questions

725
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,883
Bring on the next witness
of the prosecution

726
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:53,823
You took my parking space

727
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,450
I'm in a hurry

728
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,411
Hurry up or I'll kill you

729
00:49:59,622 --> 00:50:01,039
Nice parking

730
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:13,968
What? Gone?

731
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:16,221
What kind of an escort are you?

732
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,514
Now what?

733
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:18,515
Can't think of anything

734
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:19,724
Hopeless

735
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:20,683
tell me when you saw

736
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:22,268
the suspect running

737
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,895
What made you think

738
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:26,189
he was my client?

739
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,149
By his clothes and his build

740
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,734
that means you didn't see

741
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,903
his face clearly

742
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,280
You can say that

743
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,158
Are you near-sighted?

744
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:38,743
No

745
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,620
Good. No more questions

746
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:43,831
Next witness for the prosecution

747
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,390
...and nothing but the truth

748
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,992
I was at the squatter huts on duty

749
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:20,535
the 1 st, 2nd, 3rd

750
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,912
& 4th defendants opened fire

751
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,914
they got on a bus

752
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,542
and I cook a short cut

753
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:29,043
A civilian...

754
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:31,879
used his car to block the bus

755
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:34,132
3 defendants fell off the bus

756
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:36,509
I arrested the 1 st defendant on the bus

757
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,511
He tried to

758
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,305
bribe me

759
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,392
Very clear, thank you

760
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:49,314
You said you were at the squatter huts

761
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:51,107
What time was it?

762
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:52,483
It was about six

763
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:53,443
About six?

764
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:54,652
5:55

765
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:56,195
So let's stay 6:00

766
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:58,489
Do you know in December

767
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:02,035
the sun rises after 6:23

768
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:03,453
no

769
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:04,495
Ls that right?

770
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:05,747
How would I know?

771
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:06,956
Do you know that saying

772
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,875
"Darkness before dawn"?

773
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,293
No

774
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:11,461
The meaning is

775
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:16,257
there is darkness before the sun rises

776
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:17,508
I might have heard of that

777
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,718
Great,

778
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,553
under such circumstances

779
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:21,888
Should we believe

780
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,682
you actually saw my client as a suspect?

781
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:27,852
Believe it or not, that's your business

782
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:31,022
You said you took the short cut

783
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,565
to stop the bus

784
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:35,985
Was the bus always in your sight?

785
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:38,905
Yes

786
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:39,822
Why did you hesitate?

787
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:40,823
I want to be sure

788
00:52:41,075 --> 00:52:42,158
that means you are a bit doubtful

789
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:42,825
I object

790
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,160
Objection sustained

791
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:47,038
Witness should be sure of his answer

792
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:50,041
How much time did you
take to go down the hill?

793
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:53,127
And you kept the bus in sight all the time

794
00:52:53,379 --> 00:52:54,420
I was rushing down,

795
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:56,547
my sight was blocked momentarily

796
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:59,717
May be during this short while

797
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,095
Another bus overtook the original one

798
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:03,346
there was only one bus on the road

799
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:04,555
You are lying

800
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:05,723
I object

801
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:07,058
Sustained

802
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:09,644
Defense should rephrase his question

803
00:53:10,813 --> 00:53:12,146
Are you lying?

804
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:13,398
No

805
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:14,732
Do you know...

806
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:16,943
there are four lines of
bus routes passing there

807
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:19,153
two of the lines have a bus

808
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:20,863
running every 5 minutes

809
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:23,658
the other two every 6 minutes

810
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:24,951
that means 88 buses

811
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,203
passing through per hour

812
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:30,540
More than 1 per minute

813
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:32,166
I didn't know

814
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:34,335
From the time you went down to stop the bus

815
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:35,586
How much time did you use?

816
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:36,879
About 2 minutes

817
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:38,214
More precisely

818
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,382
2-1/2 minutes

819
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:40,675
that means at least 2 or 3
buses would have gone by

820
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:42,885
Or even up to 7 or 8

821
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:46,013
But you said only one, that's lying

822
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:48,391
Haven't you ever waited
for a bus for 1/2 an hour

823
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:57,066
So, let's say

824
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:58,609
there was only one bus

825
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:00,486
And you insisted you saw the bus

826
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:02,238
all the time

827
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:05,867
Which part of the bus was in your sight?

828
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:07,076
The body

829
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,119
How much of the body?

830
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,662
The whole bus

831
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,414
You are lying

832
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:13,249
What's that, again?

833
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:15,835
You saw only one side of the body

834
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,379
No more than 50%, that's half

835
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,881
You couldn't see

836
00:54:20,132 --> 00:54:22,216
the other half, right?

837
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:23,468
Yes

838
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:25,011
On the other side...

839
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:27,138
which you couldn't see
anything could have...

840
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:28,556
happened there

841
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:29,640
Yes

842
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:30,767
Anyone who jumped off the bus

843
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:33,186
would be unseen

844
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,146
Yes

845
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:36,481
Louder please

846
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:38,441
I would jump, but not him

847
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:40,693
Just answer the question, no comment please

848
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,695
You think anyone can jump off a bus

849
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,030
You try it

850
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:46,532
Calm down please, Constable Chan

851
00:54:46,909 --> 00:54:48,659
Why did he want to bribe me then?

852
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:49,911
How did he bribe you?

853
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:51,204
He said I could have the case of money

854
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:52,246
if I let him go

855
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:53,831
If someone stopped the bus and...

856
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:55,792
Pointed a gun at you,

857
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:57,126
what would you do

858
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:58,169
I object

859
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,212
Objection overruled

860
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:00,171
You must answer

861
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,173
I'd give my money to him

862
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:03,925
that's what my client did

863
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:05,676
under the circumstances

864
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:07,220
Right, Constable?

865
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:08,012
No

866
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:09,180
I had shown my ID

867
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:10,932
there were cases

868
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:12,350
where robbers pretended to be cops

869
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:13,309
I object

870
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:15,228
Objection sustained

871
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:19,482
Please ask relevant questions only

872
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:20,733
My apology

873
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:22,276
It happened like this

874
00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:23,569
A business man

875
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:25,947
was on the way to a deal

876
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,158
A heroic policeman pointed a gun at him

877
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,618
by mistake

878
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:33,371
the business man thought he was a robber

879
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:34,664
So he told the robber

880
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:37,083
he could have the money

881
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:40,503
Is that right?

882
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:43,422
I object

883
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,800
You don't have to answer

884
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:49,011
But we all know the answer

885
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:50,763
No need for Constable Chan to say it

886
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,306
I have finished

887
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:58,145
Great

888
00:55:58,397 --> 00:55:59,146
now what?

889
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:00,231
I know what to do

890
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:01,315
It is unfair to let him free

891
00:56:01,567 --> 00:56:02,567
Of course

892
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:09,448
We apply for postponement,

893
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,950
our prime witness is absent

894
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:12,159
I object

895
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:13,202
A postponement

896
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:14,537
is unfair to my client

897
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:16,080
the prosecution has little evidence

898
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,415
to charge my client

899
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:19,500
I ask your honor to dismiss the case

900
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:22,003
We have a taped evidence

901
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:23,212
from our witness

902
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,381
But tape is not legal evidence

903
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,174
But the absent witness plays a key role

904
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:28,634
I object

905
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:30,887
Since this is an important case

906
00:56:31,138 --> 00:56:33,180
A postponement

907
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:35,933
is unfair to the defendant

908
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:37,727
Let's hear

909
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:39,770
what the witness has to say

910
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:41,856
this is the only way

911
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,660
Louder please

912
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:56,454
thank you

913
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,604
Your Honour, it is an old tape

914
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:24,857
Please keep on listening

915
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,944
Coming up

916
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:34,367
What are you doing?

917
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:35,826
Nothing

918
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:38,871
It hurts

919
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,083
It's breaking, easy

920
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:44,126
It's breaking

921
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:47,004
What's this ugly thing

922
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:48,631
Get rid of it

923
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:50,633
What, this is my precious

924
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,051
It's a cactus

925
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:53,052
How come?

926
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,763
You got me wet

927
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:57,223
I'll wipe it for you

928
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:01,060
Oh, no

929
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,646
I spilled the orange juice

930
00:58:05,107 --> 00:58:08,275
It wasn't what you think

931
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,695
Easy, you're so rough

932
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:15,324
So uncomfortable on the
sofa, let's go to bed

933
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:18,244
OK. Let's go

934
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,704
Where do I sleep?

935
00:58:19,955 --> 00:58:21,330
In my bed

936
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:22,790
How about you

937
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,250
next to you

938
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:27,920
I like your style

939
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:30,923
It's coming

940
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:36,387
thank you for your cooperation

941
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:38,055
not too close please

942
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:41,183
Get lost

943
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:43,060
Ka Kui

944
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:47,440
Give me a report of the whole case

945
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:48,983
YES SIR

946
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:51,152
Boss

947
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:52,361
Coming out now

948
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:54,238
No photos

949
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:55,656
Get lost

950
00:59:00,746 --> 00:59:04,081
Reserve a room at the country club, John

951
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:06,542
A toast to justice

952
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:07,543
OK

953
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:08,544
I must go, Mr Chu

954
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:09,420
thank you

955
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:11,005
Goodbye

956
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:24,935
Hire him as a prosecutor next time

957
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:30,816
It's time for the Police Stories again

958
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:32,359
We have here...

959
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:35,154
a brave officer for our guest

960
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:37,031
Sitting next to me

961
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:40,493
is Constable Chan Ka Kui

962
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:41,827
Greetings, Constable Chan

963
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:42,912
Hello

964
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:43,871
Hello everybody

965
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:45,122
Inspector Chan

966
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:48,292
After cracking down the greatest drug case

967
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:49,627
You've become a familiar name

968
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:51,962
to every citizen

969
00:59:52,214 --> 00:59:53,881
Would you please describe

970
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:56,425
the operation to us

971
00:59:58,095 --> 00:59:59,887
the success is due to

972
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,056
the team work of the unit

973
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:03,641
I'm only one of them

974
01:00:03,892 --> 01:00:06,560
We did a lot of homework

975
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:08,771
What makes Special Corps

976
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,523
so different?

977
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:13,025
To be in the Special Corps

978
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,401
One must be strong,

979
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:16,362
swift and fast

980
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:17,613
And have great will power

981
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:18,948
Boss

982
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:20,741
What's the matter?

983
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:23,577
He is on the cover of

984
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:25,246
at least 3 weeklies

985
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:28,290
He's been nominated for some award too

986
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,929
Oh, thailand is out of stock

987
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,347
Why

988
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:44,431
they've all changed jobs?

989
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:45,683
No,

990
01:00:45,684 --> 01:00:48,269
but all the goods have gone to no. Seven

991
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:49,854
they want cash

992
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:53,274
Boss, Mr Cheung is here

993
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:54,942
Please come in

994
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:57,611
Mr Chu

995
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:00,531
I've received your check, thank you

996
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:01,866
thank you

997
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,285
How is it?

998
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:06,245
I've studied with my colleagues

999
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:07,830
things remain confiscated

1000
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,748
during prosecution

1001
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,625
that means I can't get my stuff back yet

1002
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:13,836
Including your passport
and you bank accounts

1003
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:15,671
to them it is just an intermission

1004
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:17,131
If you are found guilty

1005
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:19,049
All your properties

1006
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:20,342
will be confiscated

1007
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:23,554
I won't have money to escape even

1008
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:24,763
Boss, a call

1009
01:01:25,891 --> 01:01:26,974
Sorry

1010
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:31,645
Hi, Salina

1011
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,481
So boring here, I want to go out

1012
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:36,233
You can't for the time being

1013
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:37,735
I want to see you

1014
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:41,155
Later, you can't show up yet

1015
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:43,240
the police are looking for you

1016
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:45,868
I'm planning your Europe trip

1017
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:48,621
Once there, you'll be OK

1018
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:50,915
Listen

1019
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:52,875
Wait till everything's quieted down

1020
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:59,882
Hello

1021
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:04,970
Where were we?

1022
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:07,139
We were lucky...

1023
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,349
this time

1024
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:09,850
If they have more solid evidence...

1025
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:11,518
or Salina

1026
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:12,853
It would be a different story

1027
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:15,773
they won't find her

1028
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:17,191
that's good them

1029
01:02:17,192 --> 01:02:18,817
I have to go, bye

1030
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:20,361
Bye

1031
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:24,573
Boss, Cheung is right

1032
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:26,325
Salina is a problem

1033
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,577
You can't hide her away forever

1034
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:31,121
Yes, uncle

1035
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:34,333
that cop is after Snakie to find Salina

1036
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,418
Can't we send her away?

1037
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:38,671
She must never return

1038
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:42,675
Let's make use of the cop

1039
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:44,260
to kill her

1040
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:50,099
there're lots of other beautiful girls

1041
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:53,102
We've all those beauty pageants

1042
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:57,940
inspector Man wants to see you

1043
01:02:58,441 --> 01:02:59,692
Send him in

1044
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:01,860
Hasn't he been paid?

1045
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:03,070
$100,000

1046
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:06,407
but he's contemplating retirement

1047
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:07,992
So what?

1048
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:10,119
He wants more

1049
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:11,829
Inspector Man, please

1050
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:13,664
Inspector Man

1051
01:03:13,665 --> 01:03:14,456
Mr Chu

1052
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:15,416
Sit down please

1053
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:16,417
Please

1054
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:17,543
I'm here for...

1055
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:21,714
You'd like to retire to small business

1056
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:23,132
I support your idea

1057
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:24,425
thank you

1058
01:03:24,676 --> 01:03:27,261
You are a man of substance

1059
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,847
I'd like you to do one more thing for me

1060
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:31,515
What is it?

1061
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:35,227
We want that cop to disappear

1062
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:46,322
You want glory, I'll give you glory

1063
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:19,063
take down your number

1064
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:23,317
1985, come to patrol with me

1065
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:24,485
YES SIR

1067
01:04:26,154 --> 01:04:27,571
If anything happens,

1068
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:28,781
call...

1069
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:29,990
Call you with the radio

1070
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:31,408
Call me at home

1071
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:32,409
But you'll be on patrol

1072
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:36,413
We go by my home

1073
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:51,136
Excuse me, I need to go to the toilet

1074
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:53,430
Don't break the John

1075
01:04:56,935 --> 01:04:57,976
Sha tau Kok Station

1076
01:04:58,228 --> 01:05:00,145
You want me, Chan?

1077
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:02,689
Of course, any information?

1078
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:05,275
Salina? Give me more time

1079
01:05:05,527 --> 01:05:07,569
It's a tough job

1080
01:05:07,821 --> 01:05:09,863
though? tough to get paid too

1081
01:05:10,115 --> 01:05:11,782
I know my job

1082
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:13,242
I'll do my best

1083
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:14,868
What? Wait

1084
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,703
Wait?

1085
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:19,957
Sha tau Kok Station, wait

1086
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:24,336
I'll give you 3 days

1087
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:25,712
3 days?

1088
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:29,967
That's not enough

1089
01:05:30,218 --> 01:05:31,552
What, later?

1090
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:32,761
4 days then

1091
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:35,264
You'll be in trouble if I get transferred

1092
01:05:35,557 --> 01:05:38,016
that's it for now

1093
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:41,812
Who do you want?

1094
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:43,355
Ka Kui, why keep me waiting?

1095
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,693
Chan? Just a second

1096
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,070
Your call, Chan

1097
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:52,364
thanks

1098
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:55,492
Who do you want?

1099
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:56,702
This is May

1100
01:05:56,703 --> 01:05:57,411
May

1101
01:05:57,412 --> 01:05:58,745
Who was that?

1102
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:01,748
Yes that rude guy

1103
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:04,835
Lau, you should be...

1104
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:06,128
more polite to civilians

1105
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:08,714
Sorry

1106
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:11,049
OK. I've scolded him

1107
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:12,593
What is it. May?

1108
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:13,594
What are you doing?

1109
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,179
Me?

1110
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:17,681
I'm speaking to you

1111
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:18,891
Have you eaten yet?

1112
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:20,601
No

1113
01:06:21,019 --> 01:06:23,812
I'm cooking some noodles,
have you eaten yet?

1114
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:25,147
No

1115
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:28,609
Wait a second

1116
01:06:30,612 --> 01:06:31,945
Sha tau Kok Station, hold on

1117
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:34,531
May

1118
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:37,326
My mom invites you to dinner

1119
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:39,453
Is that so? Anytime

1120
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:40,829
Wait a second

1121
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:41,413
Sha tau Kok Station

1122
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:42,498
My husband beat me up

1123
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:43,749
What? What about your husband?

1124
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
He beat me up

1125
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:46,960
You beat him up or he beat you up

1126
01:06:47,212 --> 01:06:48,754
My husband beat me up

1127
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,339
Don't cry

1128
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:53,175
I'll give you the right line

1129
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,719
May, I'm free Sunday

1130
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:56,929
Don't hang up

1131
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:59,264
I'm still connecting for you

1132
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:01,767
Sha tau Kok Station, speak up

1133
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:03,185
I've lost a cow

1134
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:07,564
Oh! I'll connect you to Missing Persons

1135
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:08,690
It's busy

1136
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:09,358
Sha tau Kok Station

1137
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:10,192
I've been raped

1138
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:11,276
What? Rape?

1139
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:12,986
Wait, let me write it down

1140
01:07:19,077 --> 01:07:20,244
When were you raped?

1141
01:07:20,495 --> 01:07:22,412
Rape, no, my husband beat me up

1142
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:24,540
Oh! It's you

1143
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:25,916
I'm still connecting your call

1144
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:26,833
It takes so long

1145
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:29,127
It's a big station, be patient

1146
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:32,881
Who's been raped?

1147
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:34,466
Me

1148
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:36,051
The cow has to wait

1149
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:37,970
When were you raped?

1150
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:39,179
Last year

1151
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:40,889
Last year, why report it now?

1152
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,058
I want to know if there're
any afterward pills

1153
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:44,810
Pills?

1154
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:46,228
I'll find out for you

1155
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:49,022
Hello, Missing Persons Department

1156
01:07:49,274 --> 01:07:50,274
I've lost a cow

1157
01:07:50,525 --> 01:07:52,442
Bring in a photo

1158
01:07:52,694 --> 01:07:53,735
of the cow

1159
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:57,030
Hello

1160
01:07:59,117 --> 01:08:02,077
May, I'm very busy

1161
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:04,204
I name a place for dinner

1162
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:05,706
Let me think

1163
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:08,208
Hello

1164
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:09,543
Where shall we go?

1165
01:08:09,544 --> 01:08:10,669
Go to Family Planning Association

1166
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:13,005
tell her to take double portions

1167
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:15,048
It's free

1168
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:17,509
May

1169
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:19,553
tell my mom to take the pills?

1170
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:21,930
What's up? May

1171
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:24,057
tell my mom to take the pills?

1172
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:27,561
Hello

1173
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:38,697
tell my mom to take the pills?

1174
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,407
She isn't pregnant

1175
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:55,732
Sha tau Kok Station

1176
01:09:55,983 --> 01:09:57,317
this is telephone Co. testing

1177
01:09:58,945 --> 01:10:00,153
testing?

1178
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:14,459
Is there a traffic jam?

1179
01:10:16,087 --> 01:10:17,129
No, there's no traffic jam

1180
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:19,089
Why then?

1181
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:21,258
If there's a jam, I wouldn't be here yet

1182
01:10:22,552 --> 01:10:24,010
My mom hates people

1183
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:25,804
who are late

1184
01:10:26,097 --> 01:10:27,347
Let me explain, May

1185
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:29,850
I've been waiting for Snakie to call

1186
01:10:30,101 --> 01:10:31,727
Because of this case,
you've been transferred

1187
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:33,103
Why don't you leave this alone?

1188
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:34,396
I want satisfaction

1189
01:10:36,691 --> 01:10:37,983
I'll return call first

1190
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:42,070
Hold on to the car, the handbrake is broken

1191
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:44,114
Hold on to it

1192
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:57,335
Hello, Snakie, it's me

1193
01:10:57,587 --> 01:10:58,628
the girl witness you are looking for

1194
01:10:58,880 --> 01:10:59,880
Is hiding in a villa

1195
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:02,424
in Rosary village

1196
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:04,217
Where?

1197
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:06,887
Hurry up!

1198
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:09,222
Or Mr Chu will kill her first

1199
01:11:09,474 --> 01:11:10,432
No kidding

1200
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:13,268
I won't kid you, hurry

1201
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:18,648
May

1202
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:19,691
Don't tell me you're not coming to dinner

1203
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:21,109
Chu's going to kill the witness,

1204
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,944
I must go

1205
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:24,696
No way

1206
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:26,323
If she's dead, Chu is going to be free

1207
01:11:26,574 --> 01:11:28,116
You know what Chu has done to me

1208
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:30,911
And it's a matter of life and death

1209
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:32,245
What are you doing?

1210
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:33,413
The car...

1211
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:41,838
What about the car?

1212
01:11:41,839 --> 01:11:43,048
Taxi

1213
01:11:44,217 --> 01:11:45,801
Call a tow-truck

1214
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:48,970
And apologize to your mom, bye

1215
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:51,765
Be careful

1216
01:11:59,065 --> 01:11:59,981
Keep the change

1217
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:01,066
thank you

1218
01:13:13,264 --> 01:13:14,389
How come?

1219
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,641
I don't know why they tied me up

1220
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:17,976
Any body else here?

1221
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:20,186
They are all gone

1222
01:13:20,438 --> 01:13:22,105
Now you know what kind of person is Chu

1223
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:24,482
If only you had...

1224
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:26,276
cooperated with us

1225
01:13:27,612 --> 01:13:29,070
Lucky I'm well informed

1226
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:32,198
Or you'd be dead by now

1227
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:38,663
Hurry up

1228
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:40,582
Let's go

1229
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:32,217
Don't move

1230
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:39,724
Step aside

1231
01:14:43,062 --> 01:14:44,396
How did you know I'd be here?

1232
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:47,232
Of course I know

1233
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:56,700
It couldn't be...

1234
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:58,201
Surprised?

1235
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:01,830
There are a lot of surprises

1236
01:15:02,665 --> 01:15:04,082
According to plan?

1237
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:08,253
Yes, according to plan

1238
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:10,088
But the Boss...

1239
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:13,216
wants to shoot him with his own gun

1240
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:15,468
Once and for all

1241
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:18,847
Shoot who?

1242
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:32,652
Hurry up

1243
01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:39,743
Go

1244
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:49,002
Don't, I can't

1245
01:15:51,005 --> 01:15:54,257
Don't

1246
01:15:54,842 --> 01:15:56,384
Jump

1247
01:16:02,349 --> 01:16:03,808
Move

1248
01:16:09,148 --> 01:16:11,107
Don't move

1249
01:16:14,695 --> 01:16:15,904
Get Salina

1250
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:22,535
You are a worthy opponent

1251
01:16:30,044 --> 01:16:31,211
Enough

1252
01:16:33,214 --> 01:16:35,006
take care of him, I'll clean up

1253
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:37,092
I guarantee

1254
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:38,343
he didn't do that

1255
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:41,137
We need proof

1256
01:16:41,388 --> 01:16:42,388
How come...

1257
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:43,556
he's gone with his gun

1258
01:16:43,808 --> 01:16:45,183
And the bullet

1259
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:46,768
is from his gun

1260
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:48,061
How do you explain?

1261
01:16:48,062 --> 01:16:50,021
A cop has a lot of enemies

1262
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:51,898
Someone might want to frame him

1263
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:53,775
If this happened to a civilian

1264
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:55,110
not happened to Ka Kui

1265
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:56,402
What would we have done?

1266
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:59,948
Sir, one shouldn't always go by the book

1267
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:01,866
One must also show trust in his men

1268
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:03,243
I have nothing against Ka Kui

1269
01:17:03,494 --> 01:17:04,536
I just want people to know

1270
01:17:04,787 --> 01:17:06,830
that we don't cover up...

1271
01:17:07,081 --> 01:17:09,082
our own faults

1272
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:10,959
But I think...

1273
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:13,169
you are overdoing it

1274
01:17:13,712 --> 01:17:15,004
OK. Bill

1275
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:19,801
What would you do if you're in my shoes?

1276
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:57,005
Hello, May

1277
01:17:59,717 --> 01:18:01,259
Yes

1278
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:04,179
I understand

1279
01:18:06,891 --> 01:18:08,558
OK. I'll wait for you

1280
01:18:20,487 --> 01:18:21,654
What now?

1281
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:27,076
Mom worries about you

1282
01:18:40,007 --> 01:18:43,718
Ka Kui, be careful

1283
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:01,027
Ka Kui's back

1284
01:19:11,997 --> 01:19:13,831
- Ka Kui - Ka Kui

1285
01:19:19,296 --> 01:19:20,588
Ka Kui

1286
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:23,716
I didn't do it

1287
01:19:23,968 --> 01:19:25,009
We believe you

1288
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:27,136
Where have you been?

1289
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:30,306
I don't know

1290
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:31,724
Don't say you don't know

1291
01:19:32,393 --> 01:19:34,852
Drunk? With a girl?

1292
01:19:36,981 --> 01:19:38,815
I was fighting Danny Chu & his gang

1293
01:19:39,566 --> 01:19:41,526
Man came in and pointed his gun at me

1294
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:44,779
they took my gun and shot Man

1295
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:47,407
And I can't remember the rest

1296
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:48,992
So?

1297
01:19:49,243 --> 01:19:50,410
Everyone knows you & Man
weren't good friends

1298
01:19:50,661 --> 01:19:52,120
And you bullet...

1299
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:53,830
is found in his body

1300
01:19:54,081 --> 01:19:55,581
I didn't kill him

1301
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:57,542
I wouldn't do it over
such small conflicts...

1302
01:19:57,793 --> 01:19:59,210
But who's going to believe you

1303
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:02,588
We need proof

1304
01:20:04,383 --> 01:20:05,550
But at least you are back

1305
01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:07,010
Hand in your gun first

1306
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:10,888
Call homicide

1307
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:13,099
that the prime suspect has given himself up

1308
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:14,642
Call two men in

1309
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:18,521
Don't worry,

1310
01:20:19,023 --> 01:20:21,024
we'll help you

1311
01:20:22,943 --> 01:20:23,985
take him to the cell

1312
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:25,278
YES SIR

1313
01:20:25,279 --> 01:20:27,905
Charge him with murder

1314
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:32,785
Sir...

1315
01:20:36,123 --> 01:20:37,248
Freeze

1316
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:38,958
What are you doing, Ka Kui?

1317
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:41,502
I didn't kill anybody

1318
01:20:42,463 --> 01:20:44,380
Why charge me with murder?

1319
01:20:44,631 --> 01:20:45,923
I didn't say you killed him

1320
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:47,508
But I must charge...

1321
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:48,968
according to evidence

1322
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:51,012
I've been framed

1323
01:20:51,555 --> 01:20:52,972
Can't you tell?

1324
01:20:53,223 --> 01:20:54,932
I'll look into it

1325
01:20:55,726 --> 01:20:57,143
Don't give me that!

1326
01:20:57,394 --> 01:20:59,145
Ka Kui, let him go

1327
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:02,648
no

1328
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:04,650
Ka Kui, this is dangerous

1329
01:21:04,902 --> 01:21:06,444
Dangerous for him

1330
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:07,987
When we were risking our lives

1331
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:10,573
He was sitting here
thinking of his girlfriends

1332
01:21:10,824 --> 01:21:12,075
We put the crooks under arrest,

1333
01:21:12,326 --> 01:21:13,868
he argued about procedure

1334
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:16,037
And that stupid idea

1335
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:19,123
of protecting the witness

1336
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:22,543
One move from his lips,
we've to risk our lives

1337
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:24,379
- Ka Kui - Shut up

1338
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:27,382
You got promoted at our expense

1339
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:29,592
Have you ever thought of us?

1340
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:31,302
A man killed...

1341
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:34,263
only means 3 bows and a full report

1342
01:21:35,391 --> 01:21:37,517
We are human too

1343
01:21:38,185 --> 01:21:40,019
If we hadn't fought for you

1344
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:42,063
Would you have such a luxurious office

1345
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:44,399
- Ka Kui - Get away

1346
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:46,025
Don't come near

1347
01:21:46,276 --> 01:21:47,819
Or I'll shoot him

1348
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:48,986
Ka Kui

1349
01:21:48,987 --> 01:21:50,029
Don't

1350
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:51,823
Open up

1351
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:53,616
- Listen to me - Don't move

1352
01:21:54,535 --> 01:21:55,993
Don't come near

1353
01:21:56,495 --> 01:21:58,454
- Don't - never mind me

1354
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:01,874
I know what I'm doing

1355
01:22:05,963 --> 01:22:07,046
What a mess!

1356
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,173
Ka Kui has Lee for a hostage

1357
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:10,967
What's the matter?

1358
01:22:10,968 --> 01:22:11,843
Everyone stays where he is

1359
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:12,802
Don't move

1360
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:14,011
Don't come near

1361
01:22:14,012 --> 01:22:14,846
Calm down

1362
01:22:14,847 --> 01:22:16,431
Ka Kui, take it easy

1363
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:18,433
Don't come near

1364
01:22:21,311 --> 01:22:22,854
think carefully, Ka Kui

1365
01:22:23,105 --> 01:22:24,355
Let's talk about it

1366
01:22:24,731 --> 01:22:26,524
Yeah?! Let's talk about it

1367
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:28,693
Hands on the table so I can see

1368
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:31,279
On the table

1369
01:22:32,573 --> 01:22:33,865
this is very stupid

1370
01:22:34,116 --> 01:22:36,117
Calm down

1371
01:22:36,368 --> 01:22:37,618
before it's too late

1372
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:38,870
We'll clear you up,

1373
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:40,121
trust us

1374
01:22:40,372 --> 01:22:41,831
I trust you,

1375
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:43,332
but I can't depend on you

1376
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:44,542
But you'll be in deeper trouble

1377
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:45,918
Don't push me

1378
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:47,462
Freeze

1379
01:22:51,133 --> 01:22:52,133
Ka Kui

1380
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:56,762
Don't push him

1381
01:22:57,431 --> 01:23:00,141
Alert all units, send in sharpshooters

1382
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:21,078
Easy everybody

1383
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:27,084
Ka Kui

1384
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:36,802
Get in the car

1385
01:23:39,181 --> 01:23:39,972
Ka Kui

1386
01:23:39,973 --> 01:23:41,432
Drive off

1387
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,144
Ka Kui

1388
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:47,188
Don't follow

1389
01:23:49,191 --> 01:23:50,274
the superintendent's life is at stake

1390
01:23:55,197 --> 01:23:56,405
Where are you going?

1391
01:24:00,536 --> 01:24:01,953
Stop

1392
01:24:04,873 --> 01:24:06,082
Get off

1393
01:24:13,549 --> 01:24:16,425
I couldn't shoot even
if you didn't cooperate

1394
01:24:16,677 --> 01:24:17,885
this isn't bad

1395
01:24:18,178 --> 01:24:19,262
I don't know

1396
01:24:19,513 --> 01:24:21,806
how else to help you

1397
01:24:22,933 --> 01:24:24,976
As soon as I get back, I'll come after you

1398
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:28,563
I won't let you get me

1399
01:24:28,855 --> 01:24:30,481
before I get Chu

1400
01:24:31,275 --> 01:24:33,609
From now on, be very careful

1401
01:24:34,111 --> 01:24:35,778
thank you, sir

1402
01:24:41,868 --> 01:24:44,579
But it's tough to find where Salina is

1403
01:24:45,539 --> 01:24:49,208
Let's just get a couple of girls

1404
01:25:05,225 --> 01:25:07,226
He forced me...

1405
01:25:07,477 --> 01:25:08,811
to do it

1406
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:10,813
I have nothing to do with it

1407
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:15,985
Eat

1408
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:22,283
Can I eat? I'm hungry

1409
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:19,965
Boss

1410
01:26:19,966 --> 01:26:22,176
that cop is on the loose

1411
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:23,594
Didn't the police take him in?

1412
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:25,805
He kidnapped the superintendent

1413
01:26:26,348 --> 01:26:28,349
Great guy

1414
01:26:28,767 --> 01:26:30,101
We should have

1415
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:31,310
killed him too

1416
01:26:31,561 --> 01:26:32,895
Once and for all

1417
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:34,563
Where is Salina?

1418
01:26:34,815 --> 01:26:36,649
Wing and Snakie are on her heels

1419
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:38,859
But no news yet

1420
01:26:39,111 --> 01:26:41,195
Would Saline be with the cop?

1421
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:50,287
What is it, Boss?

1422
01:26:56,336 --> 01:26:57,753
Someone stole my computer data

1423
01:26:58,004 --> 01:26:59,255
Who?

1424
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:00,840
Must be Salina

1425
01:27:01,091 --> 01:27:02,550
Only she knows the code

1426
01:27:02,801 --> 01:27:03,801
Go get he

1427
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:05,010
Alert all men

1428
01:27:05,262 --> 01:27:05,928
Call counselor Cheung

1429
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:06,887
Yes

1430
01:27:21,695 --> 01:27:22,820
How much longer?

1431
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:24,488
Impatient?

1432
01:27:25,615 --> 01:27:26,699
No

1433
01:27:27,325 --> 01:27:28,909
I'm scared

1434
01:27:40,881 --> 01:27:41,964
You two stand guard over there

1435
01:27:56,021 --> 01:27:57,062
Here

1436
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:02,151
What?

1437
01:28:02,152 --> 01:28:03,235
Call up Bill, hurry

1438
01:28:05,363 --> 01:28:06,697
Must get the data, or we're in trouble

1439
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:08,949
Hurry

1440
01:28:47,823 --> 01:28:48,906
this way, go

1441
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:54,286
Ka Kui

1442
01:28:54,913 --> 01:28:55,913
Why didn't you go to the police?

1443
01:28:56,164 --> 01:28:57,665
Thee might be Sergeant Man's men there

1444
01:28:57,916 --> 01:28:58,958
You are my witness,

1445
01:28:59,209 --> 01:29:00,292
I'm counting on you

1446
01:29:00,293 --> 01:29:01,710
I've got Chu's data

1447
01:29:20,814 --> 01:29:22,356
Right here

1448
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:48,215
take her back to the office, hurry

1449
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:52,553
not here

1450
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:54,305
none of your business

1451
01:30:02,314 --> 01:30:03,397
Go

1452
01:30:31,051 --> 01:30:32,217
Get him

1453
01:32:27,876 --> 01:32:29,168
Go away

1454
01:32:30,503 --> 01:32:31,462
Go

1455
01:32:31,463 --> 01:32:34,173
I don't

1456
01:32:37,594 --> 01:32:38,635
Kill him

1457
01:33:54,504 --> 01:33:55,754
Catch

1458
01:33:57,674 --> 01:33:59,341
Here, get it back

1459
01:34:03,054 --> 01:34:04,096
May

1460
01:34:04,347 --> 01:34:05,472
Are you OK Ka Kui?

1461
01:34:05,473 --> 01:34:07,307
Get the brief case

1462
01:34:07,809 --> 01:34:08,976
Yes

1463
01:34:16,234 --> 01:34:17,776
Go to hell

1464
01:34:21,114 --> 01:34:22,614
Chu tu

1465
01:34:28,746 --> 01:34:29,955
Hurry

1466
01:34:38,173 --> 01:34:39,423
Go

1467
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:07,492
Ka Kui

1468
01:35:07,493 --> 01:35:08,202
Don't

1469
01:35:08,203 --> 01:35:09,578
Easy, Ka Kui

1470
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:14,666
Put down the weapon

1471
01:35:14,918 --> 01:35:16,084
We'll take over

1472
01:35:16,085 --> 01:35:17,085
Ka Kui

1473
01:35:17,086 --> 01:35:18,253
this is between us

1474
01:35:18,254 --> 01:35:19,963
the law will take care it

1475
01:35:20,215 --> 01:35:22,716
the law? there is no justice

1476
01:35:22,967 --> 01:35:24,134
the law is on his side

1477
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:25,552
Don't do anything foolish

1478
01:35:25,803 --> 01:35:26,887
I could kill him now

1479
01:35:27,138 --> 01:35:28,222
with no regrets

1480
01:35:28,223 --> 01:35:30,057
Danny Chu killed Man

1481
01:35:32,018 --> 01:35:34,895
All evidence is in the brief case

1482
01:35:40,109 --> 01:35:40,901
Are you alright?

1483
01:35:40,902 --> 01:35:43,111
May is hurt, take care of her first

1484
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:52,996
Block all exits, take them all in

1485
01:35:53,248 --> 01:35:54,581
You cops are going too far

1486
01:35:54,832 --> 01:35:56,250
threatening innocent citizens

1487
01:35:56,501 --> 01:35:57,918
with a weapon

1488
01:35:59,837 --> 01:36:02,756
You are not above the law

1489
01:36:03,007 --> 01:36:04,007
On behalf of my client

1490
01:36:04,259 --> 01:36:05,926
I'm going to sue you

1491
01:36:06,177 --> 01:36:07,886
for assault, kidnap

1492
01:36:08,137 --> 01:36:10,347
And threat

1493
01:36:10,598 --> 01:36:13,058
this is miscarriage of justice

1494
01:36:13,309 --> 01:36:14,977
Disturbance of peace

1495
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:19,189
You can all see

1496
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:20,482
Let go Ka Kui

1497
01:36:20,733 --> 01:36:21,817
Don't fall into his trap

1498
01:36:21,818 --> 01:36:23,360
Get ready for jail

1499
01:36:23,611 --> 01:36:25,320
threatening the counselor too

1500
01:36:25,863 --> 01:36:27,948
thanks for coming

1501
01:36:31,828 --> 01:36:32,911
You...

1502
01:36:49,429 --> 01:36:51,013
You must help me with the report

1503
01:36:51,514 --> 01:36:52,681
What!

1504
01:36:52,932 --> 01:36:54,266
Let's write it together

1505
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:56,226
I didn't see anything

1506
01:37:08,072 --> 01:37:11,950
Ka Kui, enough
