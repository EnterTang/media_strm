"In 1836, Chen Xieng from Xinhui
of Guangdong Province,"

2
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,394
"he wrote a text book in order to facilitate him
to teach martial arts,"

3
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,919

7
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,909
Wow, thank you.

8
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,196
Got it!

9
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,192
Oh! Hey, man

10
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,630
Thanks.

11
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,518
Hey! Look out!

12
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,670
Sorry.

13
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,953
- Hi, Susie.
- Hi.

14
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,109
Can I sit there?

15
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,110
Yes.

16
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,756
What do you want?

17
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,439
- Just give me the usual.
- Okay.

18
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,828
Hey, Jie.

19
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,519
- Talk to you later.
- Fine.

20
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,074
Hey, no fighting...

21
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,275
Get away!

22
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,830
Behind you!

23
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,310
Be careful, I will come back again!

24
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,393
Thank you, thank you.

25
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,274
- Hey...
- How is it?

26
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,077
Are you okay?

27
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,435
Ken, get out with your friend, get out!

28
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,117
What?

29
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,669
- Get out!
- God!

30
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,399
My Jesus!

31
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,153
So what plan do you have now?

32
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,273
I really want to learn
Chinese martial arts in China.

33
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,670
Chinese martial arts in China?

34
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,555
Is there anything particular you want to learn?

35
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,917
It's always an idea for me to learn
Chinese Kung-fu, but...

36
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,158
I only want to learn Choyleefut.

37
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,554
Choyleefut?

38
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,355
Yeah, what?

39
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,751
Nothing, it's a good choice.

40
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,431
Well, here I am.

41
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,870
- Well, take care, man.
- You too.

42
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,355
When I was in China,

43
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,957
I always wanted to view the moon
in a foreign country.

44
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,593
Now, I am standing under the moon
on a foreign land,

45
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,154
Except the style of living,

46
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,313
I have found that the moon is no different
from the one in China.

47
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,518
Is there something wrong with you?

48
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,429
Big Bro.

49
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,074
Let's have some beer.

50
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,239
I am sorry, it's a bit messy.

51
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,992
It looks like you haven't got any girlfriend yet.

52
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,713
Why are you here in UK?

53
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,434
Business trip.

54
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,274
So I came to visit you too.

55
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,189
This is for you.

56
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,389
- Mobile phone?
- Yes.

57
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,112
I already got one.

58
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,272
That is old, it's time to change a new one.

59
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,112
It's a nag to change a new phone.

60
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,157
I have to input all names and phone numbers again.

61
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,996
Whenever we meet something new,
we won't get used to it at once.

62
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,272
So you have to try to overcome it.

63
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,431
This is same as learning how to be a man.

64
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,878
If you don't try, you'll have no progress.

65
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,037
Don't just stick to the same place.

66
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,155
Understand?

67
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,396
Big bro, where is your next stop?

68
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,828
I am tired, my next stop is home.

69
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,588
Home? Which home? China?

70
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,957
No matter how one achieves,

71
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,197
He must know where his root is.

72
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,429
He must know how to go home.

73
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,309
Let me ask you,

74
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,153
You've lived abroad for quite a long time,

75
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,309
What have you found?

76
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,359
I haven't thought of this question.

77
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,913
So, you have had no goal.

78
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,520
Instead of wasting time, why not go home earlier?

79
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,155
When will you go home?

80
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,876
I'll leave when everything is fixed
at the new school, how about you?

81
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,115
Take care.

82
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,351
It's cold, better wear more clothes.

83
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,035
It's weird! Whenever I see his back,

84
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,311
I always have a very strong sense,

85
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,639
This nagging guy...

86
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,875
He is my dad.

87
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,515
"Pan-America International"

88
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,669
Now we can see is...

89
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,115
a famous school of martial arts in China,
The famous Choyleefut School of Martial Arts.

90
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,588
The students from this school...

91
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,113
They are all over the world.

92
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,238
About this Chinese Kung Fu craze,

93
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,118
Along with their strength,

94
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,111
The power will be unlimited.

95
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,232
These two are the principal masters
of this School of Martial Arts.

96
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,113
Chen Tien-hong and Chen Tien-lai.

97
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,675
Chen Tien-lai is now teaching abroad.

98
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,991
Both principles and kung-fu of Choyleefut.

99
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,389
Chen Tien-lai has travelled all around the world,

100
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,795
He has visited every schools
of Choileefut in the world.

101
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,678
If we want to control this strength,

102
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,313
These two men form the origin.

103
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,993
This project spends much resources of the group,

104
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,117
And it sure has certain risk.

105
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,229
Of course it is.

106
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,391
But I trust Yu-fei's ability.

107
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,749
Just go ahead.

108
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,076
Yu-fai, have a good show.

109
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,434
Yes, boss.

110
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,952
Hey, yeah I am Jie.

111
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:26,792
I am going back to China

112
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,916
and I am wondering if you'd like to come along.

113
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,957
You don't have to if you don't want to.

114
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,799
Bye man, see you soon.

115
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,273
Sorry, are you Mr. Chen Tien-lai?

116
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,750
Yes.

117
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,673
You never told me that your family
owns the martial arts school.

118
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,159
What? You never asked!

119
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,796
Like it make no difference if I told you earlier.

120
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,356
Master, thank you.

121
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,000
Dude, what does that sign say?

122
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,516
That one?

123
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,237
Yeah!

124
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,719
Come on, I know you know Chinese.

125
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,029
You just read it.

126
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,231
Listen up! It's called...

127
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,192
Choyleefut martial arts school.

128
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,629
I've got it, I have got it at last!

129
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,551
Your Chinese improves a lot. Let's go.

130
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,394
Be careful!

131
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,508
What's up? Why did you fall?

132
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,434
What's up?

133
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,119
This is my uncle.

134
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,953
Uncle, I am back.

135
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,715
Uncle, how are you? I am Ying-jie.

136
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,798
Hi, Jie.

137
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,917
This is my Japanese friend
who I met in United Kingdom.

138
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,956
Takeda Koron.

139
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,317
You can call me Ken, nice to meet you.

140
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,196
Good... Not bad.

141
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,313
Hey, I've got something for you.

142
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,390
This is nice!

143
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,953
I bought it in UK for you.

144
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,717
It's an imported stuff!

145
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,874
Come on, let's go in and talk.

146
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,634
Ask your friend to come along.

147
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,636
Watch out!

148
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,798
Senior, I knew it's you!

149
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,229
Nice move, huh?

150
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,355
Thank you for not being tough.

151
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,994
Of course, because you're my junior!

152
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,874
My senior, and this is Ken, my friend from UK.

153
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,994
You're lucky, men.

154
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,910
My wife has cooked something you love eating.

155
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,956
Let's get in.

156
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,632
Coming...

157
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,030
These dishes are what Jie likes most.

158
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,229
Why took you so long?

159
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,995
Thank you, my sister-in-law.

160
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,556
Come on!

161
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,278
That sounds odd, better call my name.

162
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,874
Jie, is your dad on the way home?

163
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,719
He asked me to come home first.

164
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,757
He said he'd be back when his work is over.

165
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,752
We haven't seen for a long time.

166
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,271
I think your dad is talking
something bad behind me.

167
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,716
Come on, let's cheers for the friend from afar.

168
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,031
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

169
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,235
Cheers.

170
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,876
What's up with you?

171
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,591
Are all the schools of martial arts
the same in China?

172
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,990
Why do you ask this question?

173
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,192
I think this school isn't like a school.

174
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,508
I know this school isn't that conspicuous.

175
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,398
You know, my uncle you met today...

176
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,033
He is a great kung-fu master.

177
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,079
Don't you believe in me?

178
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,593
Not only my uncle,

179
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,878
My dad is great in kung-fu too.

180
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,635
How about this?

181
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,233
I'll take you to meet my uncle tomorrow.

182
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,953
I'll ask him to teach you
the authentic Choyleefut.

183
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,191
All right.

184
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,436
Let's go to sleep.

185
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,836
I heard from senior that...

186
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,594
Some visitors from a company came to the school.

187
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,113
Why were they here?

188
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,070
I don't know.

189
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,389
Why stopping me taking photo?

190
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,874
You'd behave yourself.

191
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,110
You can't take our ancestors' photos
without permission.

192
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,679
I think you'd behave yourself.

193
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,712
Please act like a gentleman.

194
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,836
Young men,

195
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,548
is there any misunderstanding?

196
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,670
He is so impolite.

197
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,795
Am I impolite?

198
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,229
Senior, can they take our ancestors' photo
without permission?

199
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,311
No, so this is your fault.

200
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,192
Miss Xia is my friend.

201
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,349
She wants to learn kung-fu here.

202
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,959
But I doubt that...

203
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,553
Your teaching is worth to learn or not.

204
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,869
What did you say?

205
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,879
Well, I just want to view
the authentic Choyleefut.

206
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,109
So you are here to ask for a fight, aren't you?

207
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,439
Okay, I'll let you view the authentic Choyleefut!

208
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,075
This is what you called authentic?

209
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,673
Since you're the guest, I don't want to hurt you.

210
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,590
Senior.

211
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,590
This is Choyleefut, what do you think?

212
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,635
I finally viewed the authentic Choyleefut.

213
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,236
So, you can leave now.

214
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,273
Hi, I am Xia Yu-fai,

215
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,237
Project director of Pan-America
International Investment Group.

216
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,755
This is our martial arts consultant,
Zuo Zhang-hong.

217
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,114
They are his students.

218
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,874
Our group would like to acquire your school
of martial arts.

219
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,276
Once your school is acquired,

220
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,317
You can enjoy excellent terms.

221
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,073
Including spacious training hall,

222
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,798
advanced training equipments,

223
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,918
And you can participate in international
martial arts competitions.

224
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,599
Sure you can be rich and famous.

225
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,439
I see.

226
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,432
So, please go back and tell your boss that...

227
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,317
About this school of martial arts...

228
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,669
We won't sell it.

229
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,360
Who are you? Can you represent this school?

230
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,638
I cannot, but my father Chen Tien-lai can.

231
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,393
He will be back soon.

232
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,318
He would definitely say no.

233
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,120
Really? So you mean...

234
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,635
Chen Tien-lai can decide the fate
of this school, can't he?

235
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,676
That's great.

236
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,270
May, please give me the Letter of Intent.

237
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,555
You can see the signature of your dad on it.

238
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,994
His intention is so clear.

239
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,196
If you agree,

240
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,271
We can proceed with the second step
of acquisition.

241
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,517
No hurry to give any statement.

242
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,352
I have a letter from Chen Tien-lai too.

243
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,515
Actually, the acquisition of your school...

244
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,591
is to raise your standard and strength.

245
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,352
And it can promote your name too.

246
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,271
This school has a history of over a hundred year.

247
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,352
Our standard is definitely not under yours.

248
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,068
How to prove it?

249
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,429
Why not have a competition between us?

250
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,632
The winner should win two of three games.

251
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,555
The winner will decide the fate of this school,
what do you think?

252
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,672
I don't think this is necessary.

253
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,198
But it sounds fun.

254
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,197
Okay.

255
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,557
All right, I'll get the contract ready
and come back to you.

256
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,510
Oh no! I think I've made a mistake.

257
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,633
Big bro, where are you now?

258
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,232
What did you father write in the letter?

259
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,279
The school is so important to my dad.

260
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,791
I don't understand why he promised to sell it.

261
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,279
Are you worrying about the race?

262
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,158
A total of three should join the competition.

263
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,277
Except my senior and I,

264
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,431
I don't know who can join us.

265
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,670
Don't worry.

266
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,197
I can join the competition too.

267
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,637
I have already thought of it, but...

268
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,913
Don't worry, I can learn Choyleefut too.

269
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,993
Trust me, dude.

270
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,635
You promised.

271
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,112
I can't imagine this would become so complicated.

272
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,635
And Ken is dragged into the mess!

273
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,790
Stop!

274
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,112
When you play the rod, be flexible!

275
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,516
Senior.

276
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,035
Forget it.

277
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,670
Why?

278
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,270
Since Uncle Chen agrees the acquisition,

279
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,919
Why should we fight?

280
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,274
Anyway, we may not sure win.

281
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,873
If we aren't confident, why go for the race?

282
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,195
I'll study hard.

283
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,759
We may not lose in the race.

284
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,353
You are so proud of yourself, aren't you?

285
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,913
Working hard isn't a matter,

286
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,991
Most important of all is to keep our school well.

287
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,116
I want everyone to know that...

288
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,555
Our school can overcome this challenge.

289
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,598
Now the school is okay, isn't it?

290
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,637
A big commercial group is going to acquire us.

291
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,872
We will be rich and famous when we join
international races, isn't that great?

292
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,916
Jie, it's you who should consider, not me.

293
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,428
Go back and think about it.

294
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,709
Senior.

295
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,315
You must consider the reputation of Choyleefut.

296
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,359
The sponsor of this competition...

297
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,596
Chiguo Air-conditioner sponsors 10 million.

298
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,876
Yi-fung Group sponsors 8 million.

299
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,076
Tai-cheong Trading sponsors 5 million.

300
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,237
The total money from the sponsors...

301
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,879
It has already reached 58 million.

302
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,392
Good, you've got a great record
just on the first day.

303
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,510
It's really a miracle.

304
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,750
30 million out of the total sum
of money is because of...

305
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,633
our martial arts consultant, Mr. Zuo Zhang-hong.

306
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,954
We have to keep working hard.

307
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,753
Before the competition, our target is 80 million.

308
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,756
Yes.

309
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,794
Hubby, come and try it.

310
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,798
I bought you a big and sweet water melon.

311
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,994
Honey, this is as sweet as you.

312
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,789
Cut the crap and eat your fruit!

313
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:13,358
Well, I think you have something to tell me.

314
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,552
Should I tell you anything?

315
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,434
Someone told me that the school is to be acquired.

316
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,868
Is it true?

317
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,713
Come on, don't be nosy.

318
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,994
You don't love me now.

319
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,599
I don't want to talk to you!
You don't love me now.

320
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,955
Honey...

321
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,515
Don't get mad, okay, I'll tell you.

322
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,957
Actually I don't know the details
of the acquisition.

323
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,588
It's because Uncle said yes already.

324
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,239
But Jie disagrees.

325
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,353
So they are going to have a competition
one month later,

326
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,511
Each side will have 3 fighters
to join the competition.

327
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,711
The winner will have the final say.

328
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,153
So, there must be some good prizes
for the competition, right?

329
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,675
Say, how about any money award?

330
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,592
I am not sure about that.

331
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,632
You're stupid!

332
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,119
Why don't you ask?

333
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,508
I am not asking...

334
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:05,151
You don't love me now.

335
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,589
You don't love me now!

336
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,829
You don't love me at all.

337
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,037
Where are you taking the water melon to?

338
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,995
Welcome.

339
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,990
My friend is over there.

340
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,159
I didn't expect you come for the contract.

341
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,992
Are you scared? You still have time
to change your mind.

342
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,592
Yes, I am worried that...

343
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,070
If you lose, you'll lose face too.

344
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,989
Cut the crap!

345
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,998
You can take it back
and study well before signing.

346
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,989
Good terms!

347
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,718
The winner will get 3 million.

348
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,197
Pan-America International is always fair.

349
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,749
You'll get the reward which you have contributed.

350
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,788
Okay, I won't send you to the door.

351
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,394
Are you asking me to leave like this?

352
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,395
So, what do you want?

353
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,918
At least you can buy me a drink.

354
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,955
I've got a date.

355
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,755
If you want to drink, you can go to another table.

356
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,235
I'll pay the bill.

357
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,360
Take your time, I won't bother you dude.

358
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:57,592
Poor girl, how can she take a cool man
as her boyfriend?

359
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:00,956
Thank you for coming.

360
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,358
Uncle, what should we do about the competition?

361
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,349
Where is starts, where it will be fixed.

362
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,551
Ken and I will try our very best.

363
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,991
But the point is, we still need one more guy.

364
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,159
You really want to compete?

365
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,078
Have good practice first.

366
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,673
So start from the basic training first.

367
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,069
Start from the basic training?

368
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,118
We only have one month's time.

369
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,556
God has fixed everything.

370
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,637
If the 3rd one is going to show up,

371
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,392
He will show up at last.

372
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,872
Now, don't think anything about the competition.

373
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,717
Have some handstand practice now.

374
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,799
It will let you view from another angle.

375
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,156
What are you doing here?

376
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,275
Why are you here?

377
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,671
I paid the school fee,
so why can't I come to school?

378
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,235
If you want to learn kung-fu, go for my senior.

379
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,354
We are now having secret training,
not open to visitors.

380
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,029
Secret training?

381
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,592
You mean handstand is part of
your secret training?

382
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,434
Be serious, otherwise, just give up.

383
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,836
By the way, I didn't say
I come for learning kung-fu.

384
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,359
I just come and walk around.

385
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,551
I like to stay wherever I want.

386
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,074
Are you falling for me?

387
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,877
Leave her alone, let's keep on practicing.

388
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,990
Okay.

389
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,518
Another week has passed.

390
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,588
Senior hasn't promised to join us.

391
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,033
Until now, I am still confused that...

392
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,918
Why my dad wants to give up the school?

393
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,395
What is his motive?

394
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,756
Can Ken and I get the last victory?

395
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,433
Why do you stay up this late?

396
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,595
Master.

397
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,797
I just can't sleep.

398
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,189
Do you want a chat?

399
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,630
Let's go.

400
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,951
Master, did I do a wrong thing?

401
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,752
Everyone has his own way of thinking.

402
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,759
You can't say it right or wrong.

403
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,990
I don't join the competition,
it is for the good of the school.

404
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,628
Our school has a history of over a hundred year.

405
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,229
All the students from every generation...

406
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,198
They all want to contribute something new
for the good of the school.

407
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,875
I am the same.

408
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,748
Let me ask you one question,

409
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,996
Do you love your wife?

410
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:44,950
Yes.

411
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,359
Will you dump your old lover...

412
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,748
Because of a new love?

413
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,989
Of course not.

414
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,430
It has a long history,
older the age, deeper in love.

415
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,352
Go to sleep now, I have got to sleep too.

416
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,395
Good night, master.

417
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,189
Are you all right?

418
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,589
Miss Xia, I am sorry.

419
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,958
Jie, take her over there and take a rest.

420
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,590
Come on.

421
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,073
Be careful...

422
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,755
Does it hurt?

423
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,115
How about this?

424
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,797
Does it hurt?

425
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,432
Not that serious, just a slight twist only.

426
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,433
It'll be all right soon.

427
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,070
I really appreciate that!

428
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,872
You don't come for learning kungfu,

429
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,268
But why do you come here everyday?

430
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,672
And, this is not your office.

431
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,559
Please don't wear high heel shoes
here again, okay?

432
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,949
None of your business!

433
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,515
You're okay now.

434
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,997
When you're home, put some ice
on the wound to comfort it.

435
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,875
Wait for me.

436
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,239
What are these shoes for?

437
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,631
Do you think we have high heel shoes for you?

438
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,230
You still have a choice,

439
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,396
Either leave here without shoes,

440
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,113
Or, you can wear these soft shoes.

441
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,150
Are they okay?

442
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,109
They don't match!

443
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,113
Look at you guys!

444
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,039
Look at your pose! It's poor!

445
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,235
You don't show any strength at all.

446
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,750
If I don't join you guys,
how can you win the race?

447
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,750
Wait!

448
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,268
Senior, what did you say?

449
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,278
Can't you hear my words?

450
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,989
Without me, how can you guys win?

451
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,119
He means he wants to fight.

452
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,110
Look at you! How can you practice like this?

453
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,191
My master just doesn't want to make any comments!

454
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,158
Master, please say something fair,

455
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,919
If I don't join them,

456
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,076
Will they have any chance to win

457
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,718
See? Remember what I told you?

458
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,837
The third one will show up sooner or later.

459
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,275
You have heard what master said, haven't you?

460
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,078
I am so important! Work hard, men!

461
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,878
Master, please say something fair.

462
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,678
I can't hear your words, please say again.

463
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,795
This is great!

464
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,312
Si-hai is weird today.

465
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,679
He doesn't want to join the race, does he?

466
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,151
Why does he practice so hard now?

467
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,108
It's hot! It's hot!

468
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,598
Si-hai is practicing under such hot weather.

469
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,400
He would definitely stink when he is home.

470
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,675
Do you agree with him to join the competition?

471
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,796
Sure, I am supporting!

472
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,956
They will have an award of 3 million if they win.

473
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,988
3 million!

474
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,633
Si-hai, work hard...

475
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,756
Hubby, I love you!

476
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,069
What is she doing?

477
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,636
I think she really loves senior so much!

478
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,998
She said so, I don't mean it.

479
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,798
- Aren't you satisfied?
- Excuse me.

480
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,630
Go practice!

481
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,032
She is so cute!

482
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,956
Master, is she Jie's girlfriend?

483
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,073
Master, is there something wrong with your eyes?

484
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,233
Do you need some eye-drops?

485
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,114
This is great! You look better now.

486
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,395
Do you think this is nice?

487
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,358
Have you changed because of me?

488
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,228
Come on! I came here for you.

489
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,072
Please come to my office at 3 tomorrow.

490
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,389
I'll show you something.

491
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,431
I know you would date me sooner or later.

492
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,110
Tomorrow at 3pm, don't be late.

493
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,316
I am leaving.

494
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,274
See you tomorrow.

495
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,953
Hi, I have an appointment with Xia Yu-fai,
my name is Jie Chen.

496
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,639
All right, please wait.

497
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,316
The appointment is 3 o'clock in the afternoon.

498
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,990
I came early.

499
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,198
Please go over there and take a seat.

500
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,952
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

501
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,355
Who is he?

502
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,437
He doesn't seem to be our colleague.

503
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,436
You came early.

504
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,789
I seldom be late.

505
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,111
I'd like to let you visit...

506
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,236
the training process of the
Pan-America International Group.

507
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,510
Are you interested?

508
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,389
Let's go.

509
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,915
How do you feel?

510
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,910
Have you eaten yet?

511
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,669
Harder please.

512
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,310
Jie, where have you been?

513
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,039
You are so serious about this competition,
aren't you?

514
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,036
Do you have to practice?

515
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,679
What's up? What's happened?

516
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,071
What's wrong with your hand?
Fighting with someone?

517
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,317
This is the difference between our trainings.

518
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,312
Hitting the metal balls and sand bags.

519
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,713
It will ruin your hands for sure!

520
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,356
For karate players, we also have similar practice.

521
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,870
That's why the lethality of karate is stunning.

522
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,632
The punch's speed is fast and strong.

523
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,598
Actually you are a great karate player,

524
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,637
Why do you want to learn Choyleefut?

525
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,111
This is all because of my grandfather.

526
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,988
In the thirteenth year of Taisho,

527
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,637
My grandfather was the bodyguard
of a senior official.

528
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,195
This senior official of Japan...

529
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,120
Once helped a Chinese named Sun.

530
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,319
Because of a chance,

531
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,315
My grandfather met the bodyguard
of that Chinese man.

532
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,590
They appreciated each other
and learnt martial arts from each other.

533
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,554
At last, the kung-fu of that Chinese bodyguard...

534
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,671
Impressed my grand-father very much.

535
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,955
My grandfather lost,

536
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,830
But what impressed him not
because of the guy's kung-fu,

537
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,236
But also the ethics.

538
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,512
Because of that chance,

539
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,875
It brought him a new face of Bushido spirit.

540
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,638
That is a stage which karate player
can never reach.

541
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,115
Later, my grandfather finally knew that,

542
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,599
That kind of kung-fu is named Choyleefut.

543
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,793
At last, they became buddies.

544
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,992
The greatest wish of my grandfather was...

545
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,390
He wanted to learn Choyleefut.

546
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,959
What a pity that he has got no chance.

547
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,235
So I want to come to China to learn Choyleefut.

548
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,154
It is to make my grandfather's wish come true.

549
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,235
You came for Choyleefut
because of your grandfather!

550
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,950
Not exactly.

551
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,157
Actually I love kung-fu.

552
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,952
Sure, I can tell.

553
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,949
Now, it's time for me to teach you guys.

554
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,313
Actually, every school has its own strength.

555
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,912
Take Choyleefut as an example.

556
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,308
We fight with techniques.

557
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,274
In our fights, punch, kick, bump, push,
pick and jump...

558
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,272
They are ever changing.

559
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:10,313
Even you have strong punches and strong kicks,

560
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,431
If you can't hit me, it's useless.

561
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,996
But if you are hit by me instead,

562
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,748
Possibly some bones will be broken at last.

563
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,993
What if you are punched first?

564
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,879
Isn't it possible?

565
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,990
Tell me, tell me...

566
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,794
How can I get punched?

567
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,078
- What's up?
- Go...

568
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,434
Uncle, don't ask now.

569
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,834
What do you want?

570
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,915
Take this spicy goose leg, come on.

571
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,556
Some wine too.

572
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,117
These are my favorites!

573
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,319
Uncle, can you teach us now?

574
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,678
Because of these food and wine,

575
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,029
I will teach you anything you ask for.

576
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,354
Uncle, you promised!

577
00:43:59,040 --> 00:43:59,870
What's up?

578
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,395
Teach us something really powerful.

579
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,637
Well, nothing is really powerful!

580
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,319
I mean the most powerful stance of Choyleefut!

581
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,839
No powerful stance at all!

582
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,151
It's not like novels!

583
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,277
Uncle, why do you eat up the food then?

584
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,037
Isn't it for greeting your uncle?

585
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,953
Don't be disappointed.

586
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,078
I have fixed everything.

587
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,590
Tomorrow, you will have a new kind of training.

588
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,069
Sure you will find them interesting and funny.

589
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,910
You lost, it's your turn.

590
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,396
Go!

591
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,750
Uncle, we have stood here for half day.

592
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,750
What are we waiting for?

593
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,752
Yes, I think you're wasting our time.

594
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,513
I am waiting for your question!

595
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:00,389
Actually you are not psychologically ready yet.

596
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,239
What do you mean?

597
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,113
Let's take an example.

598
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:08,118
If you have a doubt unsolved,

599
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,988
can you learn something whole-heartedly?

600
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,958
I don't quite understand.

601
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,872
Come on, come and hit me.

602
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:26,956
Again.

603
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,956
Jie, Si-hai, what have you seen?

604
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,109
You are fast.

605
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,028
I am not fast.

606
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,068
I just know what you guys will act.

607
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,113
When you meet your rival,

608
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:48,591
When they already know how you act,

609
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,833
You'd act something which you don't even predict.

610
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,675
This will then confuse your rival.

611
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,909
Do you guys understand?

612
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,231
I am asking you!

613
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:07,080
Go...

614
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,196
Hello?

615
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,396
Staying up late?

616
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,070
It's early now, how is your practice?

617
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,835
I am not used to that.

618
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,195
Why?

619
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,074
I am not used to not seeing you
for one whole week.

620
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,634
What do you want?

621
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,552
I will be off 2 days later.

622
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,552
Can you apply for a leave?

623
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:38,789
I'd like to have some fun with you.

624
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,032
"The birthday of Zuo Zhang-hong"

625
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,312
But I have an appointment in the afternoon,
I am only free in the morning.

626
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,632
Great, no problem, I'll come and pick you up.

627
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:52,756
Okay.

628
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,916
- Okay, bye!
- Bye!

629
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:08,589
Hubby, I checked with the property agent today.

630
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,151
There is a nice flat around.

631
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,874
With a sitting room and a living room,
just costs 800 thousand.

632
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,075
What for?

633
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,350
I check it for you.

634
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,589
I've got no money to buy any flat.

635
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,071
If you win, you will have money then.

636
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,830
That is the money for the school, not for me.

637
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,559
You risk your life for the school!

638
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,756
If you win, why will the money go to the school?

639
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,912
I fight for the name of the school.

640
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,312
If there is any award,
it sure will go to the school.

641
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:41,077
You don't want a baby.

642
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,071
You don't want us to move out.

643
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,798
You just want to live here
to take care of your master.

644
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,713
Okay, I just listened to you!

645
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,071
The truth is, you don't have a penny!

646
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,837
But have you thought of my feeling?

647
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,359
Until now,

648
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,551
I have no youth, I have no family.

649
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:05,349
I have nothing! I...

650
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,995
You don't love me now, you don't love me!

651
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,629
What time is it now?

652
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,310
Do you know you are one minute late?

653
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,512
One minute may not be important to you.

654
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,238
But this is very important to me.

655
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,628
No, it's about the car...

656
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,951
All right, it's my fault, you are right.

657
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,439
Sorry, don't get mad!

658
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,992
Move now. What's up?

659
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,635
Buckle up please.

660
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,278
Miss Xia hasn't come back yet.

661
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,436
It's all right, I'll be here waiting.

662
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,238
All right, please help yourself.

663
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:00,356
What's up?

664
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:08,876
Give it to me...

665
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,877
Give it back to me...

666
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,316
Jie, you signed the contract with our group,

667
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:47,597
Isn't it wrong for me to stay this close to you?

668
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,233
What did you say?

669
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,318
Come on, this is our personal time.

670
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,591
Look at the beautiful sun!

671
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,195
Here you are. Have an early rest.

672
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,115
Have you forgotten?

673
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,117
I am sorry, I know today is your birthday.

674
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,713
No need to say sorry to me.

675
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,833
I have always told myself...

676
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,993
I'll be happy if you are happy.

677
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,910
If you enjoy two men wooing you at the same time,

678
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,679
I am willing to take it.

679
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,314
Please don't say that.

680
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,150
Guys, listen, the three masters here...

681
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:49,676
They are from different schools of martial arts.

682
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,396
This is master Dongjia from Thailand,
he plays Thai Boxing

683
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:57,632
This is Master Liu, a master of Hong Style

684
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:01,278
And this is Master Li, a Tai-chi Master.

685
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,400
Master, do you want us to learn from them?

686
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,359
Not learning.

687
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,511
- You'll be hit by them.
- What?

688
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:13,191
Just defense, no attack.

689
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,878
If you guys want to win,

690
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,315
First you need to know how to be defeated.

691
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,276
Experience will help you grow.

692
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:47,235
More fights, more chances to win.

693
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,599
Uncle, why don't you go to sleep?

694
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,668
It's not time to sleep.

695
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,393
Uncle, you haven't changed at all.

696
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,749
Your words are always funny.

697
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,310
Come on, you don't know
how to rub your wound at all.

698
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:59,589
Let me help you.

699
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:00,716
Thank you.

700
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,712
Have your father given you any call?

701
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,828
Nope. He seems to have disappeared!

702
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,353
I called him several times,
he just didn't answer the call.

703
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:14,515
Has he called you?

704
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,873
I have no phone.

705
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,878
What's up? Are you missing him?

706
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:25,077
Yes, but...

707
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,239
I don't miss him everyday.

708
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:35,270
When a kung-fu master has reached certain stage,

709
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:38,029
It's really hard for him to find a matched rival.

710
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,034
Your father is the same.

711
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,795
Hey, you read your father's letter,

712
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,154
What did he wrote?

713
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,799
He wrote many things,
and he mentioned your name too.

714
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,194
So, what is it about?

715
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,593
Okay, I can tell you,

716
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:06,949
But you have to tell me one thing first.

717
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:09,315
Why did my dad leave here alone for his world?

718
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,078
And you have stayed behind?

719
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:25,749
Junior.

720
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,998
There is another world outside,
do you want to go with me?

721
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,078
I think it's shapeless and illusive!

722
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,790
As an old Chinese saying,
better take a solid step.

723
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,752
Do you really want to go along the stream?

724
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,390
At least I can view it.

725
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:40,955
Different people have different wills.

726
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,669
Well, let's walk our own way.

727
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,992
But every roads lead to Rome.

728
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,393
It's like a novel!

729
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:55,755
I've got it, Uncle,

730
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,229
You intentionally let my dad choose going abroad.

731
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:01,031
It's because I don't know English.

732
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,639
Come on, stop pretending!

733
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:09,193
Uncle, for this competition,

734
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:10,554
Do you think we have a chance to win?

735
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,159
The path is under your feet,

736
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:15,993
You'd choose your own path and walk.

737
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:19,912
Okay, I'll pick the stream as you did.

738
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,718
And I'll guard this old pond.

739
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,759
All right, thank you, Uncle.

740
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,957
I am going to sleep now, good night.

741
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:34,275
Jie, but you haven't told me
what your dad wrote about me.

742
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,751
I just lied, he said nothing about you.

743
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:37,796
Goodnight!

744
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:58,155
Jie, I'd like to talk to you.

745
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:59,435
I am downstairs.

746
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:16,036
Hey!

747
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:18,915
What's up?

748
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:29,949
Come on, why do you pull a long face?

749
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:34,598
About the competition tomorrow, just work hard!

750
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:37,877
What's up? Are you mad at me?

751
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,956
Stop! Stop!

752
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:48,390
What do you mean?

753
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:50,675
Get lost!

754
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:53,359
I think we should not meet again.

755
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:24,955
Yu-fai, about the relationship
between you and Jie,

756
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:27,076
It will affect the result of the competition.

757
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:28,589
It's up to your decision.

758
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,872
Yes, boss.

759
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,355
I really regret...

760
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,630
I regret not treasuring the minute
which I stayed with you.

761
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,275
If God could spare that minute to me again,

762
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,313
I think, this minute...

763
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:41,552
This minute would have become
the most precious minute in my life.

764
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:56,949
Sister-in-law.

765
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,553
You'd press with skills!

766
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,119
Let me do it. You'd better go out.

767
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:03,633
Let's get out now.

768
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,718
Honey, I am sorry.

769
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:13,869
I am sorry!

770
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:18,870
I haven't heard that word for years.

771
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,074
Do you know why?

772
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:25,751
It's because my hubby is an honest guy.

773
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:29,396
He hasn't done anything wrong to his wife.

774
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,791
But his wife...

775
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:37,236
His wife has sometimes pushed him
to do something beyond his wish.

776
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:39,035
Come on!

777
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,232
What my wife wants me to do...

778
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,078
Is what I want to do!

779
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:44,596
Got it.

780
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:46,515
Well,

781
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,793
I heard that your rivals are tough guys.

782
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:53,029
Can you win?

783
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,151
I worry that you'd get hurt.

784
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,151
Why not put it this way, I'll talk to your master,

785
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,275
I'll tell him that you'd quit.

786
01:05:58,440 --> 01:05:59,429
Who am I?

787
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,633
- You're Si-hai.
- That's right.

788
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,832
I am the senior, I will never lose.

789
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,636
You'd better go out and view my show.

790
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:09,955
Okay?

791
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,349
Senior, let's go.

792
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,159
The competition is about to start now.

793
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:32,715
Are you ready?

794
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:35,714
I will sure win.

795
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:38,638
I believe that you'll win too.

796
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:44,078
After the race, I'll go back to Japan.

797
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:45,509
Why do you leave in such a hurry?

798
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,792
I'd like to pay a visit to my grandfather's grave.

799
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,390
I want to tell him that
I've learnt the authentic Choyleefut!

800
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,754
Sure! So, will you come back?

801
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:55,509
Of course I will.

802
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,558
I don't want to leave my buddy behind.

803
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,077
- Come back as soon as possible.
- Sure.

804
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,630
Ladies and gentlemen, how are you doing?

805
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:14,030
Welcome to the First Kung-fu Competition...

806
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:17,158
Which is organized by
Pan-America International Group.

807
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:20,393
We'll have three races today,
the winner should win two out of three.

808
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,079
It is a competition regardless of
kung-fu schools and types.

809
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,832
So all the players of this competition...

810
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,709
They can use any stances from any schools
to beat their rivals.

811
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,428
Let me introduce the first two players.

812
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,830
One of them is Mr. Ren Si-hai
from Guangdong Province.

813
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,310
He is representing Choyleefut.

814
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,119
Another one is from California, America,

815
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,556
Mr. Qian-xin,
representing Pan-America International.

816
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,671
The competition starts now.

817
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:40,275
Close.

818
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,153
You have got the courage to stand on stage,

819
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:47,596
It's nice, man!

820
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,028
Better take my punch first.

821
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:50,636
Box

822
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,914
Hubby, stop fighting!

823
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,839
Hubby! Stop! Let's stop it.

824
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:18,790
Hubby, I beg you, stop!

825
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,837
- Come on, stay calm...
- Hubby!

826
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:21,955
Senior!

827
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:23,951
Honey, listen to me.

828
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:25,799
Let me fight.

829
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,189
Even I have to lose,

830
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,078
I don't want to lose like a chicken.

831
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:30,554
No!

832
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,596
Sister-in-law, trust Senior.

833
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:44,075
You're good! At least you can
come to the second round!

834
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:45,316
I just can't imagine that.

835
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:48,270
Close

836
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:51,956
Box

837
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:19,434
One, two, three, four, five, six

838
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:25,795
- One...
- Hubby!

839
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,234
Two, three...

840
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,628
I can't lose the face of the school!

841
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:35,399
Four, five, six, seven, eight!

842
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:07,871
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven

843
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,309
Hubby!

844
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:50,516
Honey!

845
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:51,635
Senior has wakened up!

846
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:52,836
Senior!

847
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:54,555
I am not dead.

848
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:57,549
You scared me! You've finally wakened up!

849
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:58,636
If I knew that this is so dangerous,

850
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,074
I wouldn't have let you join it.

851
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:03,791
Senior, your rival was punched and fell.

852
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:05,633
I think that you didn't lose at all.

853
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,153
Don't cheat.

854
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:10,432
I am inferior.

855
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:11,749
This is the result.

856
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:14,870
Si-hai.

857
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,109
You've finally grown up.

858
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:19,236
Uncle.

859
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:21,270
Dad.

860
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:23,677
Master, I am so sorry.

861
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:26,270
Silly boy, the race hasn't finished yet.

862
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,272
Who can tell the result?

863
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,437
Ken, charge up.

864
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:33,836
Okay.

865
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:35,634
Are you Ken?

866
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,149
Yes, Uncle.

867
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:38,316
Do you have faith?

868
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:40,070
Sure!

869
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:41,669
You guys remember.

870
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:43,999
Everyone can build his own path.

871
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:47,159
Wining or losing doesn't matter,
most important is,

872
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:48,673
Have you ever tried your best.

873
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:50,636
I got it.

874
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:52,876
It was a rival!

875
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:53,995
So hot and exciting!

876
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:56,628
Now, here comes the second race.

877
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,552
X-man is now representing
Pan-America International.

878
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:01,678
He comes from Florida, USA.

879
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:04,319
And the representative from Choyleefut is...

880
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:08,035
Ken, Takeda Koro from Japan.

881
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,353
Ken, charge up...

882
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:18,511
Charge up...

883
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:25,157
I heard that Ken is a karate master
of level tenth.

884
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,994
Will he play with karate,

885
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:30,071
Or Choyleefut?

886
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,350
All right, the race begins soon,
let's wait and see.

887
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:41,189
I will win!

888
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:42,710
Close!

889
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,148
Don't look too hard.

890
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:48,959
You'll have a nightmare.

891
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:53,070
Box!

892
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:18,919
- One, two, three, four...
- Bravo!

893
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,873
Five, six, seven...

894
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:31,670
Close.

895
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,030
Box!

896
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:32,436
Come on!

897
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:40,950
Close.

898
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:42,956
Box.

899
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:43,638
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...

900
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,870
Nine, ten!

901
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:47,596
Yes!

902
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:10,957
Now, it's tie.

903
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:13,715
Who do you think will win?

904
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:14,989
No matter who the winner is,

905
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:16,957
We'll be the final winner.

906
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:24,356
Big bro.

907
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:28,956
I don't have any encouragement for you.

908
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,352
Just fight your own way.

909
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:34,636
Daddy.

910
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:37,438
After winning this race,

911
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,114
I have many things to talk to you.

912
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:49,591
I haven't heard you calling me daddy
for a long time.

913
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:52,390
From your back,
I can tell you've already grown up.

914
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:55,952
Sooner or later, you can sure go beyond me.

915
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,232
The two races were so exciting.

916
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:01,913
Each side won a race.

917
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:05,072
That means, the final race,
that is the third one...

918
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:08,391
It will tell who the winner is.

919
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:11,678
Whoever wins the competition,

920
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:14,718
They will get an award of 3 million.

921
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,077
Super fight!

922
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:19,676
The one who represents
Pan-America International is...

923
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,796
He came from California, USA,

924
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:26,033
The martial arts consultant of Pan-America
International, Mr. Zuo Zhang-hong.

925
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:29,710
And the one who represents Choyleefut is...

926
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:32,314
he is the key master of the school,

927
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:34,397
Mr. Chen Tien-lai... Mr. Chen's son.

928
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:37,233
Chen Ying-jie from Guangdong Province,

929
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:22,634
I want to defeat you in front of her.

930
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:24,915
Come on!

931
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:31,196
Close.

932
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:40,276
Box

933
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:29,596
Yu-fai, you haven't made
any wrong decision before.

934
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,113
I hope this time is the same.

935
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,069
Don't you yield?

936
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:40,676
Enough, don't dream of another round.

937
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:43,115
Good, this is what I am thinking too.

938
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:44,789
I will beat you now!

939
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:47,310
Box

940
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:55,511
Choyleefut?

941
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:56,709
Out of your expectation?

942
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:58,353
I will make you convince your failure!

943
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,239
He is your student too, right?

944
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:17,909
One, two, three, four...

945
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:24,958
Five, six, seven, eight...

946
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:40,589
One, two, three, four, five...

947
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:47,229
Six, seven, eight, nine...

948
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:48,390
Ten!

949
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:55,837
- We won!
- Bravo!

950
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:11,639
Bravo! We won!

951
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:12,636
Senior!

952
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:23,077
You wrote a nice letter.

953
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:26,393
I can't imagine you would train up
your successor by a race.

954
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,237
I must thank for your match.

955
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:43,275
I...

956
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:46,155
I am sorry.

957
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,149
I am sorry.

958
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:02,079
I won't let you leave me again.

959
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:42,157
- What's up?
- Say something... Go.

960
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:45,149
Master, the award of 3 million...

961
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,640
What million? I don't know.

962
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:51,155
Ying-jie, where is your dad?

963
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:54,438
He has just been around.

964
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:01,151
Dad, where are you going?

965
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:06,154
I am leaving for Ethiopia to operate
a new school of martial arts.

966
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:08,033
I'll leave this school to you.

967
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:09,230
What?
