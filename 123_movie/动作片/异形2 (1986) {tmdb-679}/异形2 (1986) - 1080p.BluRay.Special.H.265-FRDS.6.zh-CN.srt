是的
These are your words.  "And has concentrated acid  for blood."

146
00:12:49,966 --> 00:12:51,558
这是你的说法

147
00:12:51,768 --> 00:12:54,293
它的血液有强酸性，对吗？

148
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:54,962
没错
That's right.

149
00:12:56,573 --> 00:12:59,974
听着，我知道发生什么事
Look. I can see  where this is going,

150
00:13:00,777 --> 00:13:02,972
不过我要说的是怪物的确存在
but I'm telling you  that those things exist.

151
00:13:03,213 --> 00:13:04,908
谢谢，足够了
- Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be all.  - Please. You're not listening to me.

152
00:13:04,981 --> 00:13:08,109
拜托，你没听进去 凯恩是我的队员

153
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,121
Kane, the crew member-

154
00:13:08,885 --> 00:13:12,116
他进去看过，有上千个异形的卵
Kane, who went into that ship,  said he saw  thousands of eggs there.

155
00:13:12,522 --> 00:13:15,218
谢谢你，别说了
Thousands.  Thank you.  That will be all.

156
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:16,691
该死，我还没说完
Goddamn it,  that's not all!

157
00:13:17,227 --> 00:13:20,097
要是有一只侵入 我们就真的完了
Because if one of those things  gets down here,  then that will be all!

158
00:13:20,097 --> 00:13:23,294
你和这些你认为很重要的
Then all of this-  this bullshit that you think  is so important-

159
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,401
废话便真的完了
You can just kiss  all of that good-bye!

160
00:13:32,943 --> 00:13:40,509
本庭判决蕾普莉军官 军籍号码NRC14472
It is the finding  of this court of inquiry that...

161
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,774
Warrant Officer E. Ripley,

162
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:40,903
NOC14472,

163
00:13:40,817 --> 00:13:46,523
因做出不当判断 所以不适合持有ICC执照
has acted with  questionable judgment...

164
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:48,243
and is unfit to hold  an I.C.C. license  as a commercial flight officer.

165
00:13:46,523 --> 00:13:48,320
并担任星际飞行官的任务

166
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,920
所以我们将永久吊销其执照
Said license is hereby  suspended indefinitely.

167
00:13:55,031 --> 00:13:59,736
目前将不会以任何罪名起诉你
Now, no criminal charges  will be filed against you  at this time,

168
00:13:59,736 --> 00:14:04,673
不过你将接受 六个月的心理治疗
and you are released  on your own recognizance...

169
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,801
for a six-month period  ofpsychometric probation,

170
00:14:04,741 --> 00:14:09,440
并每个月接受 ICC心理医师的检查
to include monthly review  by an I.C.C. psychiatric technician.

171
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:15,144
休庭
These proceedings are closed.

172
00:14:15,752 --> 00:14:17,242
“资料封锁”

173
00:14:25,862 --> 00:14:27,659
你应该冷静点
That could have  been better.

174
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:29,392
听着，蕾普莉
Look, I think the-  Ripley?  Van Leuwen.

175
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:34,096
你何不查查LV426区

176
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:35,040
Why don't you  just check out LV-426?

177
00:14:34,905 --> 00:14:36,270
没有这个必要
Because I don't have to.  There have been people there  for over 20 years,

178
00:14:36,873 --> 00:14:40,673
那里有人工作二十年以上 从来没说过有敌人

179
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:43,674
and they never complained  about any hostile organism.  What do you mean? What people?

180
00:14:41,378 --> 00:14:43,005
什么意思？什么人？

181
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:49,209
他们去装设大气工程 以便有空气呼吸
Terraformers.  Planet engineers.

182
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,722
They go in, set up these  big atmosphere processors  to make the air breathable.

183
00:14:49,286 --> 00:14:52,084
花了十年的时间

184
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,058
Takes decades.

185
00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:54,686
这就是我们所说的外星殖民地
It's what we call  a "Shake 'N Bake" colony.

186
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:56,588
有多少人？
How many are there?  How many colonists?

187
00:14:57,594 --> 00:14:58,492
有多少殖民地？

188
00:14:59,296 --> 00:15:01,423
不知道，大概有60到70户
I don't know-  60, maybe 70 families.  Do you mind?

189
00:15:02,632 --> 00:15:03,291
借过

190
00:15:06,203 --> 00:15:06,828
有住户？
Families.

[ Machines Clacking ]

197
00:16:27,717 --> 00:16:29,412
我到下面维修部去
I'll be down  in maintenance, okay?  Al!

198
00:16:29,486 --> 00:16:30,919
艾尔 什么事？
What?  Hey, Al.

199
00:16:31,588 --> 00:16:33,189
艾尔 干嘛？
What?  Remember you sent  some wildcatters...

200
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:37,494
你记不记得你上个礼拜 派人到异形区调查的结果

201
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,537
out to the middle  of nowhere last week,  out past the Ilium Range?

202
00:16:37,494 --> 00:16:38,483
记得，怎么了？
- Yeah, what?  - One of them's on the horn,  a mom-and-pop survey team.

203
00:16:38,528 --> 00:16:41,898
有人回报说他们找到些东西

204
00:16:41,898 --> 00:16:43,490
想知道结果有没有他一份
He says he's onto something.  He wants to know if  his claim will be honored.

205
00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:45,626
为什么不呢？
Why wouldn't his claim  be honored?

206
00:16:46,202 --> 00:16:49,638
因为是你派他到那个鬼地方去
Well, because you sent them to that  particular middle-of-nowhere  on company orders, maybe.

207
00:16:49,706 --> 00:16:55,508
我们只是奉上级的命令行事 他们也没有解释原因
I don't know.  Christ! Some honch in  a cushy office on Earth...

208
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,472
says, "Go look at  a grid reference."

209
00:16:55,545 --> 00:16:58,708
我也不会多问
We look.  They don't say why,  and I don't ask.

210
00:16:58,748 --> 00:17:01,546
我不问是因为 要等两个星期才有答案
I don't ask, because it takes  two weeks to get an answer out here,  and the answer is always-

211
00:17:01,618 --> 00:17:04,018
而答案总是“不要多问”
[ Together ]  "Don't ask."

212
00:17:04,321 --> 00:17:05,811
我要怎么跟他说呢？
So what do l  tell this guy?  [ Sighs ]

213
00:17:06,523 --> 00:17:10,152
告诉他，据我个人意见 他找到的东西就归他
Tell him as far as  I'm concerned, if he  finds something, it is his.

214
00:17:10,527 --> 00:17:11,960
莱特克 干什么？
Lydecker?  What?

215
00:17:13,263 --> 00:17:16,130
小孩不可以到这里来，快走
[ Giggling ]  You kids know you're not  supposed to be on this level!

Go on!  Get outta here!  [ Giggling ]

217
00:17:48,965 --> 00:17:51,368
你专门跑到我们去不了的地方
[ Boy ] Do too. You go  in places we can't fit.  So? That's why I'm the best.

218
00:17:51,368 --> 00:17:54,269
那又怎么样？谁叫我比你好

219
00:17:54,304 --> 00:17:59,075
别闹了，别让我再抓到 你们两个到不该去玩的地方玩
Knock it off! I catch either  of you playing in the air ducts  again, l'll tan your hides.

Wait a minute.  Annie, come and have  a look at this, will ya?

222
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:17,385
我们这次挖到宝了
Folks, we have  scored big this time.

那是什么啊？
What is it, Dad?

224
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,099
我不知道
I'm not sure.

225
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:37,213
看看我们能不能靠近一点看
Let's see if we can't get a  closer look at this thing, maybe  through that crack there on the side.

226
00:18:37,213 --> 00:18:38,703
我们该先向基地报告吧？
- Shouldn't we call in?  - Let's wait till we know  what to call it in as.

227
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:41,408
先看看这东西到底是什么

00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,584
[ Brakes Hiss ]  [ Dad ] That's about as close  as we can get.

229
00:18:45,922 --> 00:18:47,514
我们只能靠这么近了

230
00:18:48,758 --> 00:18:49,747
要不要进去看看？
Should we take  a look inside?

嗨，蕾普莉
Hiya, Ripley.  This is Lieutenant Gorman...

这是殖民地的高曼中尉
of the Colonial  Marine Corps-

我们得谈谈
Ripley,  we have to talk.

249
00:21:37,827 --> 00:21:40,796
我们与LV426失去联络
We've lost contact  with the colony on LV-426.

250
00:21:48,338 --> 00:21:49,305
我真的不能相信
I don't believe this.

251
00:21:50,406 --> 00:21:52,340
你们已曾丢我去那儿
You guys throw me at the wolves,  and now you want me  to go back out there?

252
00:21:52,408 --> 00:21:54,899
现在又叫我回去？

253
00:21:55,044 --> 00:21:56,909
免谈，这不是我的问题
Forget it.  It's not my problem.

254
00:21:58,114 --> 00:21:58,815
我可以说完吗？
Can I finish?  No.  There's no way.

255

不，没可能

256

你不必进去，我保证你的安全
Ripley, you wouldn't  be going in  with the troops.

257
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,409
I can guarantee  your safety.

258

这些殖民陆战队都是顶尖的
These Colonial Marines  are very tough hombres.

259
00:22:10,627 --> 00:22:12,527
拥有最尖端的火力装备
They're packing  state-of-the-art  firepower.

- Lieutenant, am I right?  - That's true.

262
00:22:16,966 --> 00:22:17,867
完全正确
We've been trained  to deal with situations  like this.

263
00:22:17,867 --> 00:22:19,732
接受训练就为了应付这种状况

264
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:22,338
你们不需要我，我不是军人
Then you don't need me.  I'm not a soldier.

265
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,331
可是我们不知道情况如何
[ Burke ]  Yeah, but we don't know exactly  what's going on out there.

266
00:22:26,576 --> 00:22:28,544
也许只是通讯器故障
It mayjust be  a downed transmitter,  okay?

267
00:22:28,544 --> 00:22:29,476
如果不是的话…
But if it's not,  I would like you there  as an adviser,

就这么简单
and that's all.

What's your interest  in all this?  Why are you going?

271
00:22:39,989 --> 00:22:42,458
这件事对你有什么好处？ 你为什么要去
Corporation cofinanced  that colony,

272
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:46,053
那个殖民地是我们出资支持的

along with  Colonial Administration.

274

Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.

Look, I don't have time  for this. I've got  to get to work.

277
00:22:56,506 --> 00:22:58,770
是了，听说你在货柜码头工作
Oh, right. I heard you're  working the cargo docks.

278
00:22:59,175 --> 00:22:59,869
对
That's right.

Running loaders and forklifts,  that sort of thing?  Yeah. So?

280
00:23:01,778 --> 00:23:02,710
是呀，怎样？
Nothing. I think it's great  that you're keeping busy.

281
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:05,873
没事，让自己忙一点很好

282
00:23:06,315 --> 00:23:08,180
我知道你也只能干这种差事
And I know it's the only  thing that you could get.

00:23:08,584 --> 00:23:10,609
这没有什么不对
There's nothing wrong  with it.

284
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,882
如果我能使你再当飞行官呢？
What would you say  if I told you I could  get you reinstated...

285
00:23:17,994 --> 00:23:19,825
公司方面同意和你签约
as a flight officer?

286
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:23,234
The company's already agreed  to pick up your contract.  If I go.

287
00:23:21,998 --> 00:23:22,794
只要我肯去
Yeah, if you go.

288
00:23:25,134 --> 00:23:26,294
对，只要你肯去
Come on.  That's a second chance, kiddo.

289
00:23:26,803 --> 00:23:28,600
来吧！第二春呢

290
00:23:29,005 --> 00:23:32,634
而且我认为必须要去面对
I think, personally,  for you, it would be  the best thing in the world...

291
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:34,506
你才有机会克服
to get out there  and face this thing,  get back on the horse.

292
00:23:34,544 --> 00:23:36,603
放过我，我刚看过心理医生
Spare me, Burke.  I've had my psych evaluation  this month.

293
00:23:38,548 --> 00:23:41,449
我知道，你每晚醒来直冒冷汗
Yeah, I know. I've read it. You wake  up every night. Your sheets  are soaking with sweat-

294
00:23:41,517 --> 00:23:43,644
我说不就是不
I said no,  and I mean it!

295
00:23:46,556 --> 00:23:49,354
请你走吧，我不回去
Now, please leave.  I am not going back.

296
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:53,029
我回去对你也没有好处
And I am- I would not be  any good to you if I did.

297
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:53,825
好吧
Okay. Shh.

298
00:23:57,433 --> 00:23:59,367
帮我个忙，考虑一下
Would you  do me a favor?  Just think about it.

299
00:24:03,873 --> 00:24:04,669
谢谢你的咖啡
Thanks  for the coffee.

你还好吧？
You okay?  Just tell me  one thing, Burke.

310
00:25:19,816 --> 00:25:21,613
告诉我一件事，巴克

311
00:25:22,618 --> 00:25:25,416
你要去毁灭它们，对吗？
You're going out there  to destroy them, right?

312
00:25:25,922 --> 00:25:29,449
不是研究，也不是带回来
Not to study, not to bring back,  but to wipe them out.

而是消灭它们

That's the plan.  You have my word on it.

好吧，我去
All right. I'm in.

救援行动，你会喜欢的
It's a rescue mission.  You'll love it.

对呀，你那只是公的

[Apone ]  All right. Knock it off,  knock it off.

There you go,  short shit.  Enjoy your meal.

00:31:30,619 --> 00:31:31,483
这不好笑
That wasn't funny, man.

388
00:31:36,525 --> 00:31:38,493
高曼中尉？巴克先生？
Lieutenant Gorman?  Mr. Burke?  Yeah, thanks.

389
00:31:38,527 --> 00:31:39,789
好，谢谢
Looks like the new lieutenant's  too good to eat with  the rest of us grunts.

390
00:31:40,596 --> 00:31:43,292
新任中尉不肯跟我们同桌吃饭

落水狗上岸，抖起来了
Boy's definitely got  a corncob up his ass.

我以为你从不会失手
[ Burke ]  Thought you  never miss, Bishop.

393
00:31:56,545 --> 00:31:58,814
你怎么不早说船上有生化人
You never said anything about  an android being on board.  Why not?

394
00:31:58,814 --> 00:32:03,012
我没想到，这很平常
[ Chuckles ]  It never-  never occurred to me.

395
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,648
船上一向都有生化人
It's just common practice.  We always have  a synthetic on board.

396
00:32:06,822 --> 00:32:08,619
我比较喜欢被称为“人造人”
I prefer the term  "artificial person" myself.

397
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,345
Right.

398
00:32:11,227 --> 00:32:11,921
有问题吗？
- Is there a problem?  - [ Burke ] I'm sorry.

399
00:32:13,162 --> 00:32:15,531
抱歉，我不知道为什么…
I don't know why  I didn't even-

400
00:32:15,531 --> 00:32:18,634
蕾普莉上次因生化…
Ripley's last trip out,  the syn- the artificial person  malfunctioned.

401
00:32:18,634 --> 00:32:20,659
人造人故障…
- Malfunctioned?  - There were problems and  a few deaths were involved.

402
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,637
故障

403
00:32:21,637 --> 00:32:24,071
发生问题，有些人被害死

404
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,868
真是想不到
I'm shocked.  Was it an older model?

405
00:32:26,475 --> 00:32:27,464
旧的那一型吗？
The Hyperdyne Systems  1 20-A2.

406
00:32:28,043 --> 00:32:29,977
120-A2型

407
00:32:30,045 --> 00:32:32,445
这就难怪，A2型常常有问题
That explains it then.  The A2s always were  a bit twitchy.

408
00:32:33,182 --> 00:32:35,047
现在我们这些新生代 不会有这种情形
That could never happen now  with our behavioral inhibitors.

409
00:32:35,951 --> 00:32:40,285
我绝对不会伤害人类
It is impossible for me to harm,  or by omission ofaction, allow  to be harmed, a human being.

410
00:32:41,657 --> 00:32:43,056
你真的不要？
- You sure you  don't want some?  - [ Clattering ]

411
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,153
离我远点，主教，明白吗？
You just stay away from me,  Bishop. You got that straight?

412
00:32:50,866 --> 00:32:52,265
我猜她也不喜欢玉米饼
Guess she don't like  the corn bread, either.

[ Chattering ]

414
00:33:07,082 --> 00:33:09,676
部队立正，长官驾临
[ Apone ] Squad, ten-hut!  Officer on deck!  As you were.

415
00:33:09,885 --> 00:33:11,216
稍息

416
00:33:11,287 --> 00:33:13,482
快点，快点，站好
Quickly, quickly.  Settle down.

417
00:33:14,089 --> 00:33:15,522
好了，听好
All right.  Listen up!

418
00:33:17,192 --> 00:33:18,894
早安，陆战队员
Morning, marines. l'm sorry we  didn't have time to brief you  people before we left Gateway-

419
00:33:18,894 --> 00:33:22,091
很抱歉离开基地前没时间说明

420
00:33:22,131 --> 00:33:22,995
长官
[ Hudson ]  Sir?  What is it, Hicks?

421
00:33:23,699 --> 00:33:24,791
什么事？希克斯
Hudson, sir.  He's Hicks.

422
00:33:25,401 --> 00:33:26,493
是哈德逊，长官

00:33:27,102 --> 00:33:28,296
他才是希克斯
What's the question?

424
00:33:29,505 --> 00:33:30,699
什么问题？

425
00:33:31,407 --> 00:33:34,399
这是一场战斗还是除虫行动？
Is this gonna be  a stand-up fight, sir,  or another bug hunt?

426
00:33:36,245 --> 00:33:39,315
目前只知道还没和移民联络上
All we know is that  there's still no contact  with the colony...

427
00:33:39,315 --> 00:33:41,715
还有一种异形侵入
and that a xenomorph  may be involved.

428

抱歉，什么？
Excuse me, sir.  A what?  A xenomorph.

It's a bug hunt.

430
00:33:45,154 --> 00:33:45,950
这是除虫行动

431
00:33:47,356 --> 00:33:48,653
敌人到底是谁？
- What exactly are  we dealing with here?  - Ripley.

432
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:50,422
蕾普莉

433
00:33:52,027 --> 00:33:53,153
我会把经过说出来
I'll tell you  what I know.

434
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,623
我们降落在LV426
We set down  on LV-426.

435
00:33:57,333 --> 00:34:02,032
队员把附在脸上的东西带回去
One ofour crew members was  brought back on board with  something attached to his face,

436
00:34:02,071 --> 00:34:03,732
类似寄生虫的东西
some kind of parasite.

437
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:06,030
我们试着弄下来，可是没办法
We tried to get it off.  It wouldn't come off.

438
00:34:06,342 --> 00:34:08,435
后来好像脱皮而死
Later, it seemed to come off  by itselfand die.

439
00:34:09,445 --> 00:34:10,434
肯恩的气色不错
Kane seemed fine.

440
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,849
我们一起用晚餐
We were all having dinner,  and, um,

441
00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:16,579
它一定在他体内产卵
it must have laid something  inside his throat,  some sort of embryo.

442
00:34:16,952 --> 00:34:18,783
然后他就开始…
He started- Um, he-  [ Vasquez ]  Look, man.

443
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:22,186
听着，大姐
I only need  to know one thing-  where they are.

444
00:34:22,658 --> 00:34:27,463
我只想知道它在那里？

445
00:34:27,463 --> 00:34:29,055
干掉它
Yo, Vasquez.  Kick ass.  Anytime, anywhere.

446
00:34:29,098 --> 00:34:30,565
随时随地
Right, right. Somebody said  "alien." She thought they said  "illegal alien" and signed up.

447
00:34:31,867 --> 00:34:32,663
有人一提到异形

448
00:34:32,701 --> 00:34:34,269
她就以为是非法移民

449
00:34:34,269 --> 00:34:36,294
去你的
Fuck you, man.  Anytime,  anywhere.

450
00:34:36,705 --> 00:34:37,569
随时奉陪
Are you finished?

451
00:34:37,973 --> 00:34:38,769
够了没？

452
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:45,705
希望你说的对，真的
I hope you're right.  I really do.

453
00:34:49,985 --> 00:34:52,283
好了，谢谢你，蕾普莉
Yeah, okay, right.  Thank you, Ripley.

454
00:34:53,322 --> 00:34:55,187
磁碟片上也有她的报告
We also have Ripley's  report on disk.  I suggest you study it.

455
00:34:55,491 --> 00:34:56,492
我建议你们研究一下
Because just one of those things  managed to wipe out my entire crew  in less than 24 hours.

456
00:34:56,492 --> 00:35:00,485
那只异形在24小时内 消灭我全船人员

457
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,195
如果移民发现那艘船
And if the colonists  have found that ship,  then there's no telling...

458
00:35:03,232 --> 00:35:05,097
不知道有多少只已经在活动
how many of them  have been exposed.

459
00:35:05,734 --> 00:35:06,325
明白吗？
Do you understand?

460
00:35:10,806 --> 00:35:12,831
全都在磁碟片上，最好去看看
Anyway, we have it on disk,  so you better look at it.

01:07:59,262 --> 01:08:00,752
看起来像是树脂分泌物
Looks like some sort  of secreted resin.

849
01:08:01,263 --> 01:08:03,663
没错，从哪儿来的？
Yeah, but secreted  from what?

850
01:08:05,266 --> 01:08:06,460
什么都别碰
Nobody touch nothing.

851
01:08:08,467 --> 01:08:09,559
这怪物还真有一套
Busy little  creatures, huh?

852
01:08:11,770 --> 01:08:13,294
这里真的很热
Hot as hell in here.

853
01:08:13,370 --> 01:08:14,860
对，不过这是闷热
Yeah, man,  but it's a dry heat.

854
01:08:15,171 --> 01:08:16,195
别闹了，哈德逊
[Apone ]  Knock it off, Hudson.

855
01:08:25,377 --> 01:08:27,470
中尉，这些电波枪火力如何？
Lieutenant, what do  those pulse rifles fire?

856
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,504
10公分口径高爆弹轻武器
Ten millimeter  explosive-tip caseless.

857
01:08:31,014 --> 01:08:33,175
怎么了？
Standard light  armor-piercing round.

858
01:08:33,215 --> 01:08:36,707
你的队员在主电源室下面
Why?  Well, look where  your team is.

859
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:39,114
They're right under  the primary  heat exchangers.

860
01:08:37,484 --> 01:08:39,213
又怎样？

861
01:08:40,419 --> 01:08:44,913
他们发射火力会波及冷却系统
So?

862
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:44,995
So if they fire their weapons  in there, won't they rupture  the cooling system?

863
01:08:44,989 --> 01:08:47,014
她说的一点都没错
- Ho, ho, ho. Yeah.  She's absolutely right.  - So? So what?

864
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:48,015
又怎样？

865
01:08:48,825 --> 01:08:52,784
基地原则上是座核子反应炉
Look. This whole station is  basically a big fusion reactor.

866
01:08:54,294 --> 01:08:54,885
对吗？
Right?

867
01:08:56,096 --> 01:08:59,998
她说的是热核子爆炸 一开火就完了
So you're talking about  a thermonuclear explosion,  and adios, muchachos.

868
01:09:00,498 --> 01:09:02,193
很好，太棒了
Oh, great. Wonderful.

I, uh, I want you to collect  magazines from everybody.

- Is he fuckin' crazy?  - What the hell are we supposed  to use, man, harsh language?

只准用喷火枪，不准用机枪
- Flame units only.  I want rifles slung.  - Sir, I-

Just do it, Sergeant.  And no grenades.

- Thanks a lot, Sarge.  - Hicks, cover our ass.

Head 'em out, people.

893

我要这个作埋身肉博
I like to keep this handy...  for close encounters.

这些都是失事船上能用的武器
that we could salvage  out of the A.P.C. wreckage.

1132
01:26:31,451 --> 01:26:34,648
四把50连发电波散弹枪
We got four pulse rifles  with about 50 rounds each.

1133
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:36,415
并不太理想
That ain't so good.

1134
01:26:37,321 --> 01:26:40,119
还有15个M40手榴弹
We got, uh,  1 5 of these M-40 grenades.

1135
01:26:41,223 --> 01:26:44,715
别碰，危险，甜心
Don't touch that.

1136
01:26:43,156 --> 01:26:45,616
Dangerous, honey.  Is that the only  flamethrower?

1137
01:26:44,759 --> 01:26:45,919
那是唯一的喷火枪吗？
[ Hicks ]  Yeah. It's only half full,  but it's functional.

1138
01:26:46,326 --> 01:26:48,260
对，燃料只剩一半，还能用

1139
01:26:49,662 --> 01:26:52,722
另一个坏了，我不大清楚这支
Got another one, it's damaged―  I don't know about that one.

1140
01:26:54,431 --> 01:26:58,458
好消息是 我们有四套这种机械感应器
But the good news-  we got four of these  robot sentries,

1141
01:26:59,468 --> 01:27:01,868
而且大致都相当完好
with display  and scanners intact.

1142
01:27:02,769 --> 01:27:05,533
如果我们要消灭异形的话 这些应该派得上用场
They really kick ass.  I think they'll come in handy.

1143
01:27:05,938 --> 01:27:08,839
没按时回航，几时才有救援？
How long after  we're declared overdue  can we expect a rescue?

1144
01:27:13,242 --> 01:27:16,678
17天？
Seventeen days.

1145
01:27:15,522 --> 01:27:18,065
Seventeen days?

1146
01:27:18,145 --> 01:27:20,046
老兄，我不想扫兴
Hey, man, I don't wanna rain  on your parade, but we're  not gonna last 17 hours.

1147
01:27:20,046 --> 01:27:21,536
我们连17小时都撑不了

1148
01:27:22,548 --> 01:27:24,379
那怪物不会放过我们
Those things are gonna come in  here like they did before.  They're gonna come in here-

1149
01:27:24,949 --> 01:27:25,472
他们会…
Hudson! Hudson!  They're gonna come in here  and they're gonna get us!

这小女孩没有武器都活到现在

This little girl  survived longer than that...

Why don't you  put her in charge?

You'd better just start  dealing with it, Hudson.  Listen to me.

Now, I want you to get on  a terminal and call up  some kind of floor plan file.

Do you understand?  Construction blueprints.  I don't care.

Yeah.  I need to see air ducts.

01:28:03,772 --> 01:28:06,172
任何能逃出这里的资料
every possible way  into this complex.

- Just relax.  - [ Exhales Sharply ]

1172
01:28:23,083 --> 01:28:26,917
我到化验室看高曼，继续研究
I'll be in medlab.  I'll check on Gorman,  continue my analysis.

1173

很好，这样最好
Fine.  You do that.

1174
01:28:37,892 --> 01:28:40,486
它一定是走这条通道
So this service tunnel  must be how they're moving  back and forth.

1175
01:28:40,694 --> 01:28:41,683
没错
That's right.  It moves from  the processing station...

1176
01:28:42,194 --> 01:28:45,220
它们从处理室走到地下室

1177
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:46,070
right into  the sublevel here.

1178

Come down on that.  Okay, come over.

1179

Hold. Go back.  Okay, punch that in  right there.

不，回去
No. It's back here.  Okay.

1181
01:29:04,307 --> 01:29:06,036
这里有个压力舱
Well, there's  a pressure door  at this end.

1182
01:29:07,109 --> 01:29:09,441
把它关闭可以阻挡一阵子
Couldn't we put one of  the remote sentry units  in the tunnel and then seal that door?

1183
01:29:10,111 --> 01:29:15,606
它们可能从别处进来
Yeah, that'll work,  but we gotta figure on them  getting into the complex.

1184
01:29:14,558 --> 01:29:19,562
That's right,  so we repair the barricades  at these two intersections.

1185
01:29:16,247 --> 01:29:17,339
没错

1186

1187
01:29:19,950 --> 01:29:20,848
对
Right.  And weld plate steel  over these ducts...

1188
01:29:20,917 --> 01:29:26,514
再把通道封死，这里和这里

here and here and here.

1190
01:29:27,221 --> 01:29:34,718
阻止它到化验室及主控室
That way they can  only come at us  from these two corridors.

1191
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:35,661
All right. Then we put  the other sentry units  here and here, right?

1192
01:29:36,827 --> 01:29:39,921
了不起，现在可以放心玩牌了
Right.  Outstanding.

1272
01:34:41,639 --> 01:34:44,005
很有意思，不过我没兴趣
Bishop, you know, that's  very interesting, but it doesn't  really get us anywhere, does it?

1273
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:46,698
我们到底在对抗什么东西？
I'm trying to figure out  what we're dealing with here.

1274
01:34:47,842 --> 01:34:48,831
重新想想
Let's go through it again.

1275
01:34:50,110 --> 01:34:53,637
它们捉住移民再繁殖更多怪物
They grab the colonists,  they move them over there...

1276
01:34:53,712 --> 01:34:59,617
这表示有更多异形，对吗？
and they immobilize them  to be hosts for more of these.

1277
01:34:56,858 --> 01:35:00,694
Which would mean that  there would have to be  a lot of these parasites, right?

1278
01:35:00,516 --> 01:35:02,711
至少超过一百只
One for each colonist.  That's over 100, at least.

1279
01:35:02,918 --> 01:35:04,408
是的，没错
Yes. Τhat follows.

1280
01:35:05,052 --> 01:35:07,452
每个异形都是卵生的
But each one of these things  comes from an egg, right?

1281
01:35:11,823 --> 01:35:13,620
谁把蛋藏起来呢？
So who's laying  these eggs?

1282
01:35:14,224 --> 01:35:15,452
我不确定
I'm not sure.

1283
01:35:16,859 --> 01:35:19,350
一定是我们还没见过的东西
It must be something  we haven't seen yet.

1284
01:35:19,427 --> 01:35:21,028
也许就像蚂蚁窝
Hey, maybe it's like  an ant hive.

1285
01:35:21,028 --> 01:35:22,825
你是说蜂窝吧？
Bees, man.  Bees have hives.

1286
01:35:23,063 --> 01:35:24,121
你知道我的意思
You know what I mean.  There's, like, one female  that runs the whole show.

1287
01:35:24,630 --> 01:35:27,258
它就像是女王蜂一样掌控全局

1288
01:35:27,632 --> 01:35:29,623
没错，就是女王蜂
Yes, the queen.  Ueah, the mama.

1289
01:35:29,667 --> 01:35:33,735
没错，就是它，它很难缠
She's badass, man.  I mean, big.

1290
01:35:33,735 --> 01:35:35,760
这些东西可不像蚂蚁 我知道
These things ain't ants,  estúpido.  I know that.

1291
01:35:37,438 --> 01:35:41,340
我要你把标本销毁，懂吗？
Bishop, I want these specimens  destroyed as soon as  you're finished with them.

1292
01:35:40,818 --> 01:35:43,737
- Is that clear?  - Mr. Burke gave instructions...

1293
01:35:42,541 --> 01:35:46,637
巴克先生叫我带活标本回基地
that they were to be kept alive  in stasis for return  to the company labs.

1294
01:35:50,345 --> 01:35:51,642
他特别交待的
He was very specific  about it.

1295
01:35:53,747 --> 01:35:55,874
这些标本价值非凡
Look. Those two specimens  are worth millions  to the bio-weapons division, right?

1296
01:35:56,683 --> 01:35:58,951
如果你够聪明
Now, if you're smart,  we can both come out  of this heroes,

1297
01:35:58,951 --> 01:36:00,751
咱们会成为英雄

1298
01:36:00,751 --> 01:36:03,345
下半辈子都不愁吃穿
and we will be  set up for life.

1299
01:36:04,787 --> 01:36:06,550
你疯了，巴克，你知道吗？
You're crazy, Burke.  Do you know that?

1300
01:36:07,555 --> 01:36:11,491
这种危险生物能通过检疫吗？
Do you really think you can get  a dangerous organism like that  past I.C.C. quarantine?

1301
01:36:12,091 --> 01:36:14,059
没人了解它们，怎么通不过？
How can they impound it  if they don't  know about it?

1302
01:36:14,893 --> 01:36:18,863
我会告诉他们
But they will know about it,  Burke, from me.

1303
01:36:18,863 --> 01:36:22,364
他们也会知道 你害死157个移民
Just like they'll know  that you were responsible  for the deaths of 157 colonists.

1304
01:36:22,364 --> 01:36:23,490
等一下
Wait a second.  You sent them  to that ship.

1305
01:36:23,565 --> 01:36:24,691
你派他们来这里
You're wrong.  I just checked  the colony log.

1306
01:36:24,765 --> 01:36:25,288
你弄错了

1307
01:36:25,366 --> 01:36:26,958
我查过移民日志

1308
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,697
出发日期61279 巴克卡特签署
Directive dated 6-1 2-79,  signed Burke, Carter J.

1309
01:36:31,003 --> 01:36:33,369
你派他们来，却没警告他们
You sent them out there,  and you didn't even warn them.

1310
01:36:33,871 --> 01:36:35,272
你为何不警告他们？
Why didn't you  warn them, Burke?  Okay, look.

1311
01:36:35,272 --> 01:36:36,068
听着
What if that ship  didn't even exist?  Do you ever think about that?

1312
01:36:36,672 --> 01:36:38,373
你想过那鬼船也许不存在吗？

1313
01:36:38,373 --> 01:36:39,897
我并不知道
I didn't know. So now  if I went and made a major  security situation out of it,

1314
01:36:39,975 --> 01:36:42,603
要是我小题大做

1315
01:36:42,676 --> 01:36:45,178
每个单位都来干涉
everybody steps in,  administration steps in, and  there's no exclusive rights for anybody.

1316
01:36:45,178 --> 01:36:48,113
公司得不到专利权大家都吃亏
Nobody wins.  So I made a decision,  and it was wrong.

1317
01:36:48,179 --> 01:36:52,682
我犯了错，我只是判断错误

1318
01:36:50,596 --> 01:36:53,306
It was a bad call, Ripley.  It was a bad call.

1319
01:36:52,682 --> 01:36:56,083
判断错误？那些人都死了
Bad call?  Right.

1320
01:36:56,517 --> 01:36:58,178
你知道你干了什么吗？
These people  are dead, Burke!

1321
01:36:56,894 --> 01:36:59,312
Don't you have any idea  what you've done here?

1322
01:36:59,086 --> 01:37:01,384
我一定要让他们逮到你
I'm gonna make sure  that they nail you  right to the wall for this!

1323
01:37:02,021 --> 01:37:03,886
别想夹着尾巴跑掉
You're not gonna  sleaze your way  out of this one.

1324
01:37:04,389 --> 01:37:06,220
我要整垮你
Right to the wall.

1325
01:37:08,791 --> 01:37:09,314
蕾普莉
Ripley. I-

1326
01:37:10,792 --> 01:37:13,192
我本来对你很有信心
You know, I expected  more from you.

1327
01:37:13,794 --> 01:37:16,524
我以为你是聪明人
I thought you'd be  smarter than this.

1328
01:37:17,830 --> 01:37:18,888
我很高兴让你失望
Well, I'm happy  to disappoint you.

1329
01:37:27,175 --> 01:37:29,551
[Alarm Blaring ]

1330
01:37:34,139 --> 01:37:35,507
怎么回事？
- [ Hudson ]  What is it? What's going on?  - They're coming.

1331
01:37:35,507 --> 01:37:36,807
它们来了 在哪里？
Where?  In the tunnel.

1332
01:37:36,807 --> 01:37:37,831
在坠道里

1333
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:40,395
[Automatic Gunfire ]

1334
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:45,942
Here we go. "A" and "B"  gun tracking far end.  Multiple targets.

1335
01:37:42,511 --> 01:37:44,741
我们的武器已经追踪到它们 并开火

1336
01:37:44,812 --> 01:37:45,836
目标有好多个

1337
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:53,243
这些武器还真行
Those ammo counters go.

1338
01:37:56,152 --> 01:37:57,642
弹药已经用掉一半了
"B" gun's down 50%..

1339
01:37:59,354 --> 01:38:01,254
下面一定战况激烈
Man, it's a shooting gallery  down there.

1340
01:38:05,658 --> 01:38:07,523
B枪只剩下50发子弹了
- [ Hicks ]  Sixty rounds left on "B."  - [ Beeping ]

1341
01:38:07,559 --> 01:38:10,255
40发，20发，10发
Forty. Twenty. Ten.

1342
01:38:10,961 --> 01:38:12,029
B枪弹药已经用完了
"B" gun's dry.  Twenty on "A."

1343
01:38:12,029 --> 01:38:13,326
A枪只剩下20发

1344
01:38:14,230 --> 01:38:15,561
10发，5发
- Ten. Five.  - [ Steady Beep ]

1345
01:38:20,366 --> 01:38:22,527
用完了，老天啊
That's it.

1346
01:38:23,068 --> 01:38:24,365
下面真是一场混战
Jesus, they were  wall-to-wall in there.

1347
01:38:26,484 --> 01:38:29,361
[ Pounding ]

1348
01:38:29,239 --> 01:38:30,171
它们在撞门
They're at  the pressure door.

1349
01:38:33,174 --> 01:38:34,436
我的天啊
Man, listen to that.

1350
01:38:34,875 --> 01:38:37,469
我是毕夏，有坏消息
Bishop here.  I'm afraid I have  some bad news.

1351
01:38:38,277 --> 01:38:39,835
这倒新鲜
Well, that's a switch.

1352
01:38:42,780 --> 01:38:44,680
很漂亮，有什么问题
It's very pretty, Bishop,  but what are we looking for?

1353
01:38:45,548 --> 01:38:48,039
就是那个，紧急通风口
That's it.  Emergency venting.

1354
01:38:49,283 --> 01:38:50,147
真好
Oh, that's beautiful, man.  Oh, man, that-  that just beats it all.

1355
01:38:54,053 --> 01:38:55,042
多久喷一次？
How long till it blows?  Four hours.

1356
01:38:55,754 --> 01:38:56,652
还有多久
[ Groans ]  With a blast radius  of 30 kilometers,

1357
01:38:57,689 --> 01:39:00,283
范围大概30公里半径

1358
01:39:00,357 --> 01:39:02,086
平均4千万吨
equal to about  40 megatons.

1359
01:39:03,658 --> 01:39:04,859
难题来了
We got problems.  [ Hudson ] I don't believe this.  I don't fucking believe this.

1360
01:39:04,859 --> 01:39:06,656
我不敢相信

1361
01:39:07,394 --> 01:39:08,588
娃丝佳，把窗闸关起来
Vasquez,  close the shutters.

1362
01:39:09,963 --> 01:39:11,055
为什么不从这里关闭？
Why can't we shut it  down from here?

1363
01:39:12,164 --> 01:39:14,189
抱歉，坠机造成严重损害
I'm sorry.  The crash caused  too much damage.

1364
01:39:14,265 --> 01:39:16,460
没有办法修复
An overload is inevitable  at this point.

1365
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,696
天，越来越没希望
Oh, man, and I was  getting short.

1366
01:39:19,969 --> 01:39:23,461
只差4星期我便可以退役
Four more weeks and out.  Now l'm gonna buy it  on this rock.

1367
01:39:23,570 --> 01:39:24,264
我们被困死了
It ain't half fair, man.  Hudson, give us a break!

1368
01:39:24,304 --> 01:39:25,464
哈德逊，少罗唆
[ Hudson ]  Four more weeks. Oh, man.

1369
01:39:25,571 --> 01:39:27,903
四个礼拜，天啊

1370
01:39:28,173 --> 01:39:30,471
我们必须派一艘船来救我们
We've got to get the other  drop ship from the Sulaco.

1371
01:39:31,275 --> 01:39:33,800
一定有办法摇控太空船
I mean, there must be some way  of bringing it down on remote.

1372
01:39:34,177 --> 01:39:36,577
怎么做？联络系统坏了
How? The transmitter  was on the A.P.C.  It's wasted.

1373
01:39:36,979 --> 01:39:41,382
不管怎样，我们最好想办法
I don't care how,  but we'd better think of something.  We'd better think of a way.

1374
01:39:41,681 --> 01:39:43,171
想个屁，我们死定了
Think of what?  We're fucked! We're doomed!  Shut up!

1375
01:39:43,215 --> 01:39:44,580
住嘴，住嘴
Shut up! What about  the colony transmitters?

1376
01:39:45,483 --> 01:39:48,213
殖民地的通讯器呢？

1377
01:39:47,398 --> 01:39:50,191
The uplink tower  down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?

1378
01:39:49,119 --> 01:39:50,686
不行，我查过
No, I checked.  The hardware in between here  and there was damaged.

1379
01:39:50,686 --> 01:39:52,984
那里的通道被堵住

1380
01:39:53,221 --> 01:39:54,916
没办法联接天线
We can't align the dish.

1381
01:39:55,389 --> 01:40:00,725
一定得有人拿电脑亲自去修复
Well, somebody's gonna  have to go out there,

1382
01:39:57,825 --> 01:40:00,744
take a portable terminal,  go out there  and patch in manually.

1383
01:40:00,792 --> 01:40:03,693
是呀，怪物就在附近
Oh, yeah, sure. With those  things running around?  You can count me out.

1384
01:40:04,327 --> 01:40:05,294
我可不去

1385
01:40:05,695 --> 01:40:06,992
你哪儿都不敢去
Guess we can just  count you out of everything.  I'll go.

1386
01:40:07,429 --> 01:40:09,597
没错，你去吧
[ Hudson ] That's right, man.  Why don't you go, man?

1387
01:40:09,597 --> 01:40:10,325
我去
[ Bishop ]  I'll go.  What?

1388
01:40:10,631 --> 01:40:11,698
什么？
I'll go. I mean,  I'm the only one qualified  to remote pilot the ship anyway.

1389
01:40:11,698 --> 01:40:12,323
我去

1390
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:15,600
只有我有资格遥控太空船

1391
01:40:16,501 --> 01:40:18,196
应该让主教去
Yeah, right, man.  Bishop should go.  Good idea.

1392
01:40:19,403 --> 01:40:19,994
好主意
Believe me,  I'd prefer not to.

1393
01:40:21,005 --> 01:40:22,336
相信我，我宁可不去

1394
01:40:22,939 --> 01:40:24,736
虽然我是人造人，我可不笨
I may be synthetic,  but I'm not stupid.

1395
01:40:38,314 --> 01:40:39,008
有多远？
[ Ripley]  How long?

1396
01:40:39,348 --> 01:40:41,543
水管几乎一直通到上层大厅
This conduit runs almost  to the uplink assembly-  1 80 meters.

1397
01:40:41,616 --> 01:40:42,446
180公尺

1398
01:40:43,017 --> 01:40:44,541
爬到那儿要40分钟
Say 40 minutes  to crawl down there-  [ Ripley ] Right.

1399
01:40:46,953 --> 01:40:49,148
联接天线大约要一个小时
An hour to patch in  and align the antenna.

1400
01:40:51,255 --> 01:40:52,745
把太空船准备好要30分钟
Thirty minutes  to prep the ship,

1401
01:40:53,456 --> 01:40:54,946
飞行时间约50分钟
and about 50 minutes  flight time.  It's gonna be close.

1402
01:40:55,224 --> 01:40:56,156
时间紧迫

1403
01:41:01,261 --> 01:41:01,818

Fifteen.  How many?

"C" gun's right behind it.

1414
01:41:47,018 --> 01:41:50,186
[ Hudson ]  Stopping them.  It ain't stopping them.

1415
01:41:48,755 --> 01:41:50,154
难道没有办法阻止它们吗？

Damn it!

1423
01:42:15,071 --> 01:42:16,766
等等，它们撤退了
Wait! They're retreating.

1424
01:42:22,575 --> 01:42:23,507
我们的枪火阻止它们了
[ Ripley ]  The guns stopped them.

1425
01:42:27,678 --> 01:42:28,372
你说得对
You're right.

1426
01:42:36,883 --> 01:42:38,282
下一次就没这么多子弹了
Next time they walk  right up and knock.

1427
01:42:38,885 --> 01:42:40,113
不过它们不知道这点
Yeah, but they don't  know that.

1428
01:42:40,986 --> 01:42:42,578
它们也许会从别的地方进来
They're probably looking  for other ways to get in.

1429
01:42:45,022 --> 01:42:46,284
我们可以解决它们的
That'll take 'em a while.

1430
01:42:46,789 --> 01:42:48,416
也许它们被我们逼得动弹不得
Maybe we got 'em  demoralized.  Shut up!

1431
01:42:48,491 --> 01:42:49,287
闭嘴

1432

我要你们在四处巡逻
I want you two  walking perimeter.

大家都快累死了
We're all  in strung-out shape,

可是要沉着机警点
but stay frosty  and alert.

那怪物进来我们就完了
We can't afford to let  one of those bastards in here.

好的
All right.  Vámonos.

1439

How long's it been  since you got any sleep?

1440

Twenty-four hours?

1441
01:43:35,118 --> 01:43:37,018
希克斯，我不想像他们那样
Hicks, I'm not  gonna end up  like those others.

1442
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:40,112
你会“处理善后”吧？
You'll take care  of it, won't you?

1443
01:43:43,123 --> 01:43:45,216
如果那怪物进来
If it comes to that,  I'll do us both.

我会把我俩先杀了

Listen, let's just make sure  it doesn't come to that.

All right?  All right.

这是M41A电波机关枪
This is an M-41A  pulse rifle, 10 millimeter,

with an over-and-under  30 millimeter  pump-action grenade launcher.

上下都有30厘米手榴弹筒

试试重量
Feel the weight.

1452
01:44:17,743 --> 01:44:19,142
好吧，我该怎么做？
Okay, what do I do?

1453
01:44:26,548 --> 01:44:27,742
抓紧
Okay, pull it in  tight here.  Right.

Get another one in quick.  Slap it in hard.

1461
01:44:45,659 --> 01:44:46,751
这样就能大干了
Right.  And you're ready  to rock and roll.

What's this?  That's the grenade  launcher.
