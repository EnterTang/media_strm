14
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:17,650
很久很久以前 在一个遥远的银河系....
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....

18
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,240
在他消失期间

00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,980
由帝国残余势力组成的

邪恶的第一秩序已然崛起

00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,390
在除掉最后一个绝地武士
and will not rest until

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,200
天行者之前
Skywalker, the last Jedi,

23
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,920
第一秩序绝不卸甲休兵
has been destroyed.

在共和国的鼎力支持下

莱娅・奥加纳将军

领导着一个勇敢的抵抗组织

她不顾一切地想要找到哥哥卢克

28
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,250
从而在他的帮助下

莱娅已派出最英勇的飞行员

揭示卢克行踪的线索....

36
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,700
这个东西会让一切步入正轨的
This will begin to make things right.

37
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,070
我已游历各处 阅尽沧桑
I've traveled too far and seen too much

38
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,010
以致忽略了弥漫在银河系中的绝望
to ignore the despair in the Galaxy.

39
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,820
没有了绝地武士 原力绝无平衡的可能
Without the Jedi, there can be no balance in the Force.

40
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,280
正是因为你 如今我们才拥有了一个机会
Well, because of you, now we have a chance.

41
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,610
将军已经追查此事许久了
The general has been after for this for a long time.

42
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,370
将军
The General?

43
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,780
对我来说她可是皇室
To me she's royalty.

44
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,050
她当然是了
Well, she certainly is that.

45
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,460
有人来了
We got company.

46
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,070
你得藏起来
You have to hide.

47
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,950
你得离开
You have to leave.

48
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,130
快走
Go.

49
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,540
全体出发 冲啊
Get out! Go! Go! Go!

50
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,040
快来 BB-8 动作快点
Come on BB-8, hurry!

51
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,430
炸掉那架X翼战机 开火
Blast that X-wing! Fire! Fire!

52
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,240
后方有敌人来了
Someone is coming behind us.

53
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,660
我看到了
I see him!

54
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,160
拿着 它在你这里比在我这里更安全
You take this, it's safer with you than it's with me.

55
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,540
赶快离开这里 越远越好
You get as far away from here as you can.

56
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,440
- 听明白了吗 - 我不知道...
- Do you hear me? - I don't know...

57
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,400
我会回来找你的
I'll come back for you!

58
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,390
我们都会安然无恙的
We'll be alright!

59
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,020
继续前进
Keep moving!

60
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,430
守在这里
Stay here.

61
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,550
瞧瞧你变得多老了
Look how old you'd become.

62
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,080
而你经历了比变老糟糕得多的事情
Something far worse has happened to you.

63
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,110
你明白我为何而来
You know what I've come for.

64
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,200
我知道你从何而来
I know where you come from.

65
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,720
在你称呼自己为凯洛・伦之前
Before you called yourself  'Kylo Ren'.

66
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,040
你已经找到了天行者所在位置的地图 我们都心知肚明
The Map, to Skywalker. We know you found it.

67
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,820
现在你要将这份地图上交给第一秩序
And now you're going to give it to the First Order.

68
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,930
第一秩序是从黑暗面崛起的
The First Order rose from the dark side.

69
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,460
而你不是
You did not.

70
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,960
我会让你见识一下黑暗面的
I'll show you the dark side.

71
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,530
尽管来
You may try.

72
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,460
但你不可否认的事实是 那是你的家人
But you cannot deny the truth that is your family.

73
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,330
你说的太对了
You're so right.

74
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,630
那么 谁先开始讲话呢 你 还是我
So, who talks first? Do you talk first? I talk first?

75
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,730
老家伙把地图交给你了
The old man gave it to you.

76
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,740
听懂你讲话真是太困难了 因为你整张脸都...
It's very hard to understand you with all the...

77
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,350
- 给我搜 - 我...
- Search him. - I'm more than...

78
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,170
- 什么也没有 长官 - 把他带到船上
- Nothing, sir. - Bring him on board.

79
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,740
长官 村民如何处置
Sir, the villagers?

80
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,120
全部灭口
Kill them all.

81
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,000
听我命令
On my command.

82
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,170
开火
Fire!

83
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,750
不要啊
No!

84
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,280
这里什么也没有 清除这架战机
Nothing here! Eliminate it!

85
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,210
行了 我自己走
Alright. Alright!

86
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,730
FN-2187
FN-2187.

87
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,070
上交你的爆能枪以供检查
Submit your blaster for inspection.

88
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,880
遵命 队长
Yes, Captain.

89
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,090
谁准许你摘掉头盔的
And who gave you permission to remove that helmet?

90
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,250
是我的错 队长
I'm sorry, Captain.

91
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,370
马上去我的部门报告
Report to my division at once.

92
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,670
今天你带过来的值...
What you brought me today is worth...

93
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,280
四分之一份口粮
One quarter portion.

94
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,430
太感谢啦
Oh, thank you.

95
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,320
嘘
Shhh.

96
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,930
那只是一个蒂多 想把你拆成零件[身材矮小的野蛮拾荒者]
That's just a Teedo. Wants you for parts.

97
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,420
他对任何人都没有丝毫的尊重
He has no respect for anyone.

98
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,240
你的天线折弯了
Your antenna's bent.

99
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,740
你来自哪里
Where'd you come from?

100
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:53,880
我不能讲的 这是机密
I am not suppose to tell, it's classified.

101
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,600
- 机密 真的假的 - 真的呀
- Classified, really? - Yup.

102
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,930
我来自的地方也是个巨大的秘密呢
Me too. Big secret.

103
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:01,420
尼伊马贸易哨站在那个方向 离开尔文山脉远一点
Niima Outpost is that way. Stay off Kelvin Ridge.

104
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,260
千万别靠近北部下沉区
Keep away from the sinking fields in the North

105
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,400
否则你会淹没在沙子里的
or you'll drown in the sand.

106
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,380
你真是太善良啦 我想跟你一起走
You are so very kind. I would like to come with you.

107
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,070
别跟着我 镇子在那个方向
Don't follow me. The town is that way.

108
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:16,280
那我可以跟你待在一起吗
Oh. Then, can I stay with you?

109
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,900
不行
No!

110
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,590
人家好害怕的
I am scared.

111
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,440
明早你就出发离开
In the morning, you go.

112
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,200
再次谢谢你
Thank you, again.

113
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,520
不客气
You're welcome.

114
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:58,320
我们把抵抗组织最厉害的飞行员抓到船上了 我竟毫不知情
I have no idea we had the best pilot in the Resistance on board.

115
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,780
躺得还舒服吗
You comfortable?

116
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,450
不太舒服
Not really.

117
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,240
我很是佩服
I'm impressed.

118
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,750
目前还没人能撬开你的嘴
No one has been able to get out of you

119
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,980
获取地图的下落
what you did with the map.

120
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,740
你可得重新考虑下你的审问技巧了
You might want to rethink your technique.

121
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,430
地图在哪里
Where is it?

122
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:40,540
抵抗组织不会屈服于你的淫威之下的
The Resistance will not be intimidated by you.

123
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,160
到底在哪里
Where is it?

124
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,610
地图藏在一个BB元件机器人体内
It's in a droid. A BB unit.

125
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,180
好 如果这个机器人在贾库 我们很快就会找到它的
Well then, if it's on Jakku, we'll soon have it.

126
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,250
那这件事就交给你了
I leave that to you.

127
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,770
不要放弃希望 不管你等的机密人物是谁
Don't give up hope. He still might show up.

128
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:12,800
他还是可能会出现的
Whoever it's you're waiting for. Classified.

129
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,240
我十分了解等待的滋味
I know all about waiting

130
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,670
我的家人
For my family.

131
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,980
总有一天会回来的
They'll be back, one day.

132
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,850
来吧
Come on.

133
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,030
这五件价值...
These five pieces are worth...

134
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,900
我想想
Let me see...

135
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,640
二分之一份口粮
One half portion.

136
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,400
上周每一件还值二分之一口粮的
Last week they were a half portion each.

137
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,500
这个机器人呢
What about the droid?

138
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,240
机器人怎么了
What about him?

139
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,500
我要买下他
I'll pay for him.

140
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,340
60份口粮
60 portions.

141
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,310
其实
Actually.

142
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,570
这个机器人不卖
The droid is not for sale.

143
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,220
走吧
Come on.

144
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,380
跟着这个女孩 给我抓到那个机器人
Follow the girl and get that droid.

145
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,390
伦想见一下犯人
Ren wants the prisoner.

146
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,480
这边转弯
Turn here.

147
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,430
好好听着
Listen carefully.

148
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,730
如果你完全按照我说的做 我可以帮你离开这里
If you do exactly as I say, I can get you out of here.

149
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,160

00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,180
这是一项援救行动 我是来帮你逃出去的
This is a rescue. I'm helping you escape.

151
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,900
你会驾驶钛战机吗
Can you fly a TIE fighter?

152
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,160
你是抵抗组织的一员吗
You are with the Resistance?

153
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,150
什么 不是 我只是来帮你逃出去
What? No no no. I'm breaking you out.

154
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,890
- 你会驾驶钛战机吗 - 没有什么飞行器是我驾驶不了的
- Can you fly a TIE fighter? - I can fly anything.

155
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:57,020
为什么 为什么帮我
Why? Why are you helping me?

156
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,090
因为这才是应该做的事情
Because it's the right thing to do.

157
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:01,710
你需要一位飞行员
You need a pilot.

158
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,410
我的确需要一位飞行员
I need a pilot.

159
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,980
我们就要逃出去了
We're gonna do this.

160
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,250
是吗
Yeah?

161
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,640
好了 保持冷静
Okay, stay calm, stay calm.

162
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,890
我挺冷静的
I am calm.

163
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,770
我是在跟自己说
I'm talking to myself.

164
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,250
还不行
Not yet.

165
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,530
可以了 这边走
Okay, go. This way.

166
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,590
我一直都想着能驾驶一下钛战机呢
I always wanted to fly one of these things.

167
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,600
- 你会射击吗 - 我会用爆能枪
- Can you shoot? - Blasters, I can.

168
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,040
好 原理是一样的
Okay, same principle.

169
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:38,180
使用左侧开关切换导弹 加农炮和麦加脉冲
Use the toggle on the left to switch between missiles, cannons and Mag pulses.

170
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,350
右边的准星用来瞄准 扳柄用来开火
The sight on the right to aim, triggers to fire.

171
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,340
这也太复杂了吧
This is very complicated.

172
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,860
我能解决
I can fix this.

173
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,150
第二停机场有一架战机未经许可起飞
We have an unsanctioned departure from Bay 2.

174
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,620
通知赫克斯将军 并阻止那艘战机
Alert General Hux, and stop that fighter.

175
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,130
炸掉控制室[没有听清这句话 时间轴不对]
Blow up the command.

176
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,180
搞定
I got it.

177
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,070
这家伙速度真快
This thing really moves.

178
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,200
好了 我们要是想跑远点
Alright, we got to take out as many of these cannons as we can

179
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,740
- 就得尽可能地炸掉这些加农炮 - 好的
- if we're gonna get very far. - Alright.

180
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:39,890
我会驾驶到适当位置 保持警惕
I'm going to get us in position. Just stay sharp.

181
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,000
前方 前方 看到了吗
Up ahead! Up ahead! Do you see it?

182
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,750
我驾驶到正中央了 这一发畅通无阻
I got us dead centered. It's a clean shot.

183
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,220
明白
I got it.

184
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,580
- 太棒了 - 真厉害
- Yeah! - Yes!

185
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,060
你看到了吗 看到有多准了吗
Did you see that? Did you see that?

186
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,780
看到了

F... what?

189
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,590
这是他们给我的唯一名字
That's the only name they ever gave me.

190
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,390
我不会用这个来称呼你 FN 是吧
Well, I ain't using it. FN, huh?

191
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,590
芬恩 我打算叫你芬恩 可以吗
Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn. Is it alright?

192
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,930
芬恩 好 芬恩 我喜欢这个名字

长官 那两个家伙把我们的涡轮激光炮炸毁了
Sir, they've taken out our turbo lasers.

197
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,880
使用腹侧炮
Use the ventral cannons.

198
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,740
遵命 长官 正在激活腹侧炮
Yes, sir. Bringing them online.

199
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:35,690
赫克斯将军 是那个抵抗组织的飞行员吗
General Hux, is it the Resistance pilot?

200
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,020
是的 而帮他逃出去的是我们自己人中的一个
Yes, and he had helped from one of our own.

201
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,540
正在检查登记信息以识别出该冲锋兵的身份
We are checking the registers now to identify which Stormtrooper it was.

202
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:47,390
是来自村庄那个 FN-2187
The one from the Village. FN-2187.

203
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,150
长官 腹侧炮准备完毕
Sir, ventral cannons on.

What's coming towards you? My right. Your left. Do you see it?

206
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:05,460
等等 我看到了
Hold on. I see them!

207
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,930
干得漂亮
Nice shot!

208
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,170
我们这是往哪里去
Where're we going?

209
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,620
我们得返回贾库
We're going back to Jakku, that's where.

210
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,260
不不不 我们不能回去
No, no, no. We can't go back to Jakku.

211
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,490
我们得赶紧逃出这个星系
We need to get out of this system.

212
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,660
我必须抢在第一秩序之前找到我的机器人
I got to get my droid before the First Order does.

213
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,020
- 什么 机器人 - 没错
- What? A droid? - That's right.

214
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,100
BB元件机器人 橙白相间 独一无二
The BB unit, orange and white. One of a kind.

215
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,470
我才不在乎他是什么颜色 没有任何机器人能有这么重要
I don't care what color he is! No droid can be that important!

216
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,610
这个机器人举足轻重 兄弟
This one is, man.

217
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,390
我们需要离第一秩序远一点 越远越好
We need to get as far away from the First Order as we can.

218
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,110
回到贾库 必死无疑
We go back to Jakku, we die.

219
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,780
这个机器人携带着一个能指引我们找到卢克・天行者的地图
The droid has a map that leads straight to Luke Skywalker.

220
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,180
你在逗我吧
Oh, you got to be kidding me!

221
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:47,540
FN-2187向我的部门报告 进行评估之后 送去重建条件反射
FN-2187 reported to my division, was evaluated and sent to reconditioning.

222
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,710
之前没有不符规矩的征兆吗
No prior signs of nonconformity?

223
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,660
这是他第一次进攻
This was his first offense.

224
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,820
将军 他们被击中了
General. They've been hit.

225
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,800
- 剿灭了吗 - 已丧失战斗力
- Destroyed? - Disabled.

226
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,320
他们往贾库去了
They've headed back to Jakku.

227
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,590
CIS推断坠机发生在戈亚逊石漠
The CIS projected the crash in the Goazon Badlands.

228
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,520
他们回去找机器人了
They were going back for the droid.

229
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,740
派出小队去往残骸处
Send a squad to the wreckage.

230
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,340
波
Poe!

231
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,800
波
Poe!

232
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,730
波
Poe!

233
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,730
波 我来救你
Poe! I got you.

234
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,890
波
Poe!

235
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:47,710
波
Poe!

236
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,860
最高领袖斯诺克的命令很明确
Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit.

237
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,450
尽可能活捉机器人 如果情况紧急 就摧毁它
Capture the droid if we can, but destroy it, we must.

238
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,350
将军 你的士兵有多少能耐呢
How capable are your soldiers, General?

239
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,090
我不会让你质疑我的方法的
I won't have you question my methods.

240
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,160
他们在犯叛国罪方面显然训练有素
They are obviously skilled at committing high treason.

241
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,680
或许斯诺克领袖应该考虑下使用克隆人军队
Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army.

242
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:27,500
我的士兵都是经过特殊训练的 自出生起就按照预定步骤进行
My men are exceptionally trained. Programmed from birth.

243
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:30,120
那么他们就完全可以找回机器人
Then, they should have no problem retrieving the droid,

244
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,580
并且是毫发无损
unharmed.

245
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,860
小心点 伦 你的个人兴趣妨碍了领袖斯诺克命令的执行
Careful, Ren, that your personal interest not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke.

246
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,160
我想要那张地图
I want that map.

247
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,830
为你着想 我建议你还是想办法找到它吧
For your sake, I suggest you get it.

248
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,700
水 水啊
Water. Water.

249
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,620
- 有水吗 - 没有
- Water. - No.

250
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,160
还有水吗
There's no water?

251
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:23,310
姑娘 你的机器人 我想要
Girl, your droid. I want it.

252
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,740
什么
What?

253
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,710
离他远点
Oi! Get away from him!

254
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,470
嘿
Hey!

255
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:53,250
那些家伙是什么人哪
Who are those people.

256
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,900
他们为昂卡工作
They work for Unkar.

257
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,860
小姐 那个男人
Mistress! That man!

258
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,180
谁
Who?

259
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,750
那边的那个
That man over there.

260
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,920
- 就是他 - 是的
- Him? - Yes.

261
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,070
他穿着我主人的外套
He is wearing my master's jacket.

262
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,390
小贼 你急什么呢
What is your hurry, thief?

263
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,640
啥 小贼
What? Thief?

264
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,480
嘿 你干嘛
Oww! Hey! What?

265
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,530
机器人说这件外套是你偷的
The jacket. This droid says you stole it.

266
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,430
我今天已经过得够糟糕了好不好
I had a pretty messed up day, alright?

267
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,810
要是你不再指控我 我会十分感谢
So I'd appreciate it if you'd stop accusing me...

268
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:40,140
- 别这么干了 - 你从哪搞来的
- Ow! Stop it! - Where did you get it?

269
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,160
这是它主人的东西
It belongs to his master.

270
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,050
波・达默龙的外套 这是他的名字 对不对
It belongs to Poe Dameron. That was his name, right?

271
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,160
他被第一秩序俘虏了
He was captured by the First Order.

272
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,180
我帮他逃了出来 然后我们的飞船坠毁了
I helped him escape, our ship crashed.

273
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,560
波没能挺过来
Poe didn't make it.

274
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:07,360
我尝试去救他 但没成功
I tried to help him but I'm sorry.

275
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,030
所以你是抵抗组织的人
So you're with the Resistance?

276
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,830
显而易见
Obviously.

277
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,430
没错
Yes, I am

278
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:27,940
我是抵抗组织的人 对 我是抵抗组织的一员
I'm with the Resistance, yeah. I'm with the Resistance.

279
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,820
我之前从没见过抵抗组织的战士
I never met a Resistance fighter before.

280
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,580
就长我这样 我们的一部分人长这样
I was... that's what we look like. Some of us.

281
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,170
其他人长别的样子
Others look different.

282
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:40,220
BB-8说他在执行一个秘密任务 他必须返回你们的基地
BB-8 says he's on a secret mission. He has to get back to your base.

283
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,540
据说他有一份通向天行者卢克所在地的地图
Apparently he has a map that leads to Luke Skywalker.

284
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:44,650
所有人都想得到它
And everyone is after it.

285
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,740
天行者卢克
Luke Skywalker?

286
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,910
我以为他是个神话
I thought he was a myth.

287
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,820
什么
What?

288
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,210
- 你在干什么 - 快跑
- What are you doing? - Come on.

289
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,190
跟上 BB-8
Come on, BB-8!

290
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,900
- 放开我 - 快跑 我们得离开这儿
- Let go of me! - Come on! We got to move!

291
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,810
你不拉着我的手 我也知道怎么跑
I know how to run without you holding my hand.

292
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,330
BB-8 跟紧点
BB-8, stay close!

293
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,910
往这走
This way.

294
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,190
请求空中支援
Call in the air strike.

295
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,460
咱们俩都是他们的目标
They're shooting at both of us.

296
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,610
他们看见你跟我在一起 你已经被标记了
Yeah, they saw you with me. You are marked.

297
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,790
那不还是拜你所赐
Well, thanks for that.

298
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:33,720
嗨 直接用棍子把人抡倒可不是我
Hey! I'm not the one to take you down with a stick.

299
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,650
这儿的人就没有爆能枪吗
Does anyone have blasters around here?

300
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,240
你还好吗
Are you okay?

301
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,110
嘘 嘘 嘘
Shh. Shh. Shhh.

302
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,490
别抓我的手
Stop taking my hand!

303
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,130
醒醒
Hey.

304
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,790
你没事吗
Are you okay?

305
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,410
恩
Yeah.

306
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,870
跟我来
Follow me.

307
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,790
我们跑不过他们
We can't outrun them!

308
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,920
可以的 用那辆四跃飞船
We might. In that Quad-Jumper!

309
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,650
嗨 我们需要一个飞行员
Hey! We need a pilot!

310
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,050
已经有了
We got one.

311
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,380
你吗
You?

312
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,870
那艘飞船怎么样
What about that ship?

313
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,940
那艘是垃圾
That one's GARBAGE!

314
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,640
死马当活马医吧
The garbage will do.

315
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,390
射击手的位置在那下面
Gunner position is down there!

316
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,910
你驾驶过这飞船吗
You ever fly this thing?

317
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:06,040
没有 这飞船已经很多年没被使用过了
No! This ship hasn't flown in years.

318
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,410
好吧
Great.

319
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:15,170
我能行的 我能做到
I can do this. I can do this.

320
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,020
我能行的 我能做到
I can do this. I can do this.

321
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:39,470
嘿
Hey!

322
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,830
那是我的
That's mine!

323
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,230
等等 保持低空飞行 低空飞行
Hold! Stay low! Stay low!

324
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,260
什么
What?

325
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,960
贴地飞行 扰乱他们的追踪
Stay low! It confuses their tracking.

326
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:55,100
- BB-8 坐稳了 - 为森么
- BB-8, hold on. - Whyee?

327
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,880
我要往下冲了
I'm going low!

328
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,280
你在后头干什么呢
What are you doing back there?

329
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,640
你还不还击 你在等什么
Are you ever going to fire back?

330
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:19,690
我在想办法 保护罩打开了吗
I'm working on it! Are the shields up?

331
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,690
没有副驾驶员协助 我没那么轻松
Not so easy without a co-pilot.

332
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,810
那你应该试试坐在这玩意儿上
Try sitting in this thing.

333
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,850
- 我们需要掩护 立刻马上 - 马上就会有了
- We need cover, quick. - We're about to get some!

334
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:42,280
希望如愿
I hope.

335
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,730
哇哦
Whoa.

336
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,430
该死的
Damn it.

337
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,310
拜托 给点力
Come on, come on!

338
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:25,990
干得好
Nice shot!

339
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:27,670
我现在做射击手还挺厉害
I'm getting pretty good at this.

340
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,170
大家快趴下
Let's get down!

341
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:43,260
机关炮在冲前的位置上卡死了 我无法移动它
Alright. The cannon's stuck in forward position. I can't move it.

342
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,990
你只有甩掉他们才行了
You got to lose them.

343
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,440
做好准备
Get ready!

344
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:51,680
好的 做什么准备
Okay. For what?

345
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,550
我们真要这么做吗
Are we really doing this?

346
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,410
噢 不
Oh, no.

347
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,690
- 刚才的飞行真厉害 - 射得好
- That was some flying. - Nice shooting.

348
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,010
- 谢谢 - 你是怎么做到的
- Thanks. - How did you do that?

349
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,560
- 我也不知道 - 没人训练过你吗
- I don't know. - No one trained you?

350
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,890
但我还从来没飞离过星球
But I've never left the planet.

351
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,390
- 你的最后一击太棒了 - 那简直无与伦比
- Your last shot was great. - That was amazing.

352
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,060
多亏了你的好助攻
You set me up for it.

353
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,100
- 简直是完美 - 确实很不错
- It was perfect. - That was pretty good.

354
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:09,310
你很安全 他是抵抗组织的一员
You're okay. He's with the Resistance.

355
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:12,110
他会带你回家的
He's going to get you home.

356
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,720
我们一起
We both will.

357
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:21,580
我不知道你的名字
I don't know your name.

358
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,300
芬恩 你叫什么
Finn. What's yours?

359
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,260
我是蕾伊
I'm Rey.

360
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,930
蕾伊
Rey...

361
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,980
来帮我处理这个 快点
Help me with this. Quick!

362
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:38,300
发生什么了
What...What's going on?

363
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:52,740
长官 我们没能在贾库星抓捕到那个机器人
Sir, we were unable to acquire the droid on Jakku.

364
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:59,470
他乘坐一艘被盗的科瑞利安YT型号运输舰逃脱了追捕
He escaped capture on a stolen Corellian YT model freighter.

365
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:03,890
那个机器人 偷走了一艘运输舰
The droid... stole a freighter?

366
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,690
并非如此 长官
Not exactly, sir.

367
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:08,160
他有帮手
It had help.

368
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,980
虽然还未经证实
We have no confirmation,

369
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,720
但我们怀疑是FN-2187协助了他逃离
but we believe FN-2187 may have helped him escape.

370
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,790
还有别的情况吗
Anything else?

371
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:39,190
与他们二人同行的还有一个女子
The two were accompanied by a girl.

372
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,560
什么女子
What girl?

373
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,090
是动力源的问题
It's the motivator.

374
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,780
给我一把哈里斯扳手 在那找找
Grab me a Harris wrench. Check in there.

375
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,320
- 情况有多糟 - 如果我们还想靠它活下去的话 不太好
- How bad is it? - If we want to live, not good.

376
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:56,000
他们现在还在追捕我们 我们必须得离开这个星系
They're hunting for us now. We got to get out of this system!

377
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,450
BB-8说抵抗组织基地的位置只有内部人员知道
BB-8 says the location of the Resistance base is 'need to know.'

378
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,460
如果我要带你们去那的话 我需要知道那个地点
If I'm taking you there, I need to know.

379
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:01,850
这个吗
This?

380
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,400
你得告诉我们你的基地在哪儿
You got to tell us where your base is.

381
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,550
什么 不行
What? No.

382
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:07,120
我不会说你这门语言
I don't speak that.

383
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:11,110
好吧 我只告诉你 我不是抵抗组织的人 好吧
Okay, between us, I'm not with the Resistance, okay?

384
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,080
我只是想逃离第一秩序
I'm just trying to get away from the First Order.

385
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,730
不过如果你告诉我基地在哪儿
But if you tell us where the base is,

386
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,200
我就把你先送到那去 成交吗
I'll get you there first. Deal?

387
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,340
机器人 拜托
Droid, please!

388
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,900
派莱克斯扳手 快点
Pilex driver, hurry.

389
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,980
- 所以你们的基地在哪儿 - 好的 BB-8 告诉她
- So,where is your base? - Go on, BB-8, tell her .

390
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,300
咦 呃
Huh? Eh.

391
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,020
咦 呃
Huh? Eh.

392
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:25,970
咦
Huh?

393
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,530
求你了
Please.

394
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,890
- 伊利尼姆星系 - 对 伊利尼姆星系
- The Ileenium System! - Yes, the Ileenium System.

395
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,940
就是那 把我们送到那去 越快越好
That's the one. Get us there as fast as you can.

396
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:35,930
我需要发动机胶带 赶紧
I need the engine tape, hurry.

397
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:38,000
- 你要去哪儿 - 我必须得回贾库星去
- What about you? - I got to get back to Jakku?

398
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,680
回贾库 为什么所有人都想回到贾库星
Back to Jakk... Why does everyone want to go back to Jakku?

399
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,850
- 不是这个 - 那个地方
- It's not that one. - That place is...

400
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,360
不对 不对
No. No.

401
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:44,740
是我手指的那个
The one I'm pointing to.

402
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,000
不对 不对 不对
No. No. No!

403
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,990
如果我们不把漏气的地方补上 毒气会从气箱里漫出来
If we don't patches up the propulsion, the tank will overflow

404
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,270
有毒气体会充满整艘飞船
and fill up this ship with poisonous gas.

405
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,070
- 这个 - 是的
- This? - Yes.

406
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:56,420
嗨 蕾伊 你是一位飞行员
Hey, Rey, you're a pilot.

407
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,540
你想飞去哪儿都行 为什么要回去
You can fly anywhere. Why go back?

408
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,870
你有家人在那里
You got a family?

409
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,240
还是男朋友在那里 一个帅哥男友
You got a boyfriend? A cute boyfriend?

410
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:03,190
原因就是 关你屁事
None of your business, that's why.

411
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:07,430
- 准没什么好事 - 去驾驶舱
- That can't be good. - To the cockpit.

412
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,710
我们被人跟踪了 所有控制系统都被改写了
Someone's locked on to us. All controls are overridden.

413
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,780
起开 别碰我
Get off. Get off!

414
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,330
你看见什么了
Do you see anything?

415
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,310
噢 不
Oh, no.

416
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,300
是第一秩序
It's the First order.

417
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,760
我们要怎么办 肯定有什么对策
What do we do? There must be something.

418
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,540
- 你刚刚说有有毒气体 - 我已经堵上了
- You said poisonous gas. - I fixed that.

419
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,220
你能再把它打开吗
Can you unfix it?

420
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,120
过来 BB-8
Come on, BB-8.

421
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,700
我接住他了
I got him.

422
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,680
我没事
I'm okay.

423
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,820
你觉得这招对帝国冲锋队员有用吗
Do you think this work on the Stormtroopers?

424
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,120
有用 他们的面具可以过滤烟雾但不防毒
Yeah, their masks filter out smoke not toxins.

425
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,040
快点 他们来了
Hurry, they're coming.

426
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:30,260
丘伊 我们回家了
Chewie. We're home.

427
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,580
其他人在哪儿 飞行员呢
Where are the others? Where's the pilot?

428
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,970
我就是飞行员
I'm the pilot.

429
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,200
- 你 - 她在撒谎
- You? - She's lying.

430
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:52,330
不 是真的 飞船上只有我们几个
No, it's true. We're the only ones on board.

431
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,520
你能听懂这玩意儿
You can understand that thing?

432
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,800
这玩意儿也能听得懂你说话 所以注意你的用词
And "that thing" can understand you too, so watch it.

433
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,380
从那出来
Come on out of there.

434
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:01,040
- 你从哪里得到的这艘飞船 - 尼伊马贸易哨站
- Where did you get this ship? - Niima Outpost.

435
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,190
贾库星 那个垃圾场
Jakku? That junkyard?

436
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,400
谢谢 就是个垃圾场
Thank you! Junkyard.

437
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,000
我跟你说过我们应该再搜索一遍西境
I told you we should've double check the Western Reaches.

438
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,500
它在谁手里 杜凯恩
Who had her? Ducain?

439
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,850
我偷了它 从昂卡・普拉特那
I stole it. From Unkar Plutt.

440
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:13,190
他从欧文兄弟那偷的 欧文兄弟是从杜凯恩那偷的
He stole it from the Irving Boys, who stole it from Ducain.

441
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,230
他偷的我的
Who stole it from me!

442
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:17,570
你告诉他汉・索洛如今又把千年隼偷回来了
Well, you tell him that Han Solo just stole back

443
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:19,580
不会再丢了
the Millennium Falcon, for good

444
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:23,110
这艘船是千年隼号 你是汉・索洛
This is the "Millennium Falcon"? You are Han Solo?

445
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:25,750
我曾经是
I used to be.

446
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,880
汉・索洛 那个义军将军
Han Solo, the Rebellion general?

447
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:29,260
不 是走私犯
No, the smuggler.

448
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,050
他不是个战斗英雄吗
Wasn't he a war hero?

449
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:34,510
这就是那艘只用十四秒差距完成科舍尔航程的飞船
This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in 14 parsecs.

450
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,030
十二秒
12!

451
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,820
什么十四秒
14.

452
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,130
嗨
Hey!

453
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:58,450
有个穆夫牛挤奶工在点火线上装了个压缩机
Some moof milker put a compressor on the ignition line.

454
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,580
昂卡・普拉特做的
Unkar Plutt did it.

455
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,100
我也觉得这是个错误 把太多压力留给了
I thought it was a mistake too. Puts too much...

456
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,430
- 超光速推进器 - 超光速推进器
- ... stress on the hyperdrive. - Stress on the hyperdrive.

457
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,970
丘伊 把他们扔到飞行舱里
Chewie, throw them in a pod.

458
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:08,460
我们一会儿把他们放到最近的无人星上
We'll drop them on the nearest uninhabited planet.

459
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:11,100
等等 不行 我们需要你的帮助
Wait, no! We need your help.

460
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,190
我的帮助
My help?

461
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:15,840
这个机器人必须尽快赶到抵抗组织基地
This droid has to get to the Resistance base as soon as possible.

462
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:18,750
他携带着一份通向天行者卢克所在地的地图
He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker.

463
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:26,060
你是大名鼎鼎的汉・索洛 和义军并肩作战过
You are the Han Solo that fought with the Rebellion.

464
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,410
你肯定知道他
You knew him.

465
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,990
是的 我知道他
Yeah, I knew him.

466
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,080
我认识卢克
I knew Luke.

467
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:46,960
别告诉我有一只拉思塔逃跑了
Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten loose.

468
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:48,580
等等 什么
Wait, what?

469
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,760
你刚刚是说了拉思塔吗
Did you just say 'Rathtar'?

470
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,240
嗨
Hey!

471
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:55,070
你不是在用这艘运输舰走私拉思塔吧
You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter, are you?

472
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:57,190
我是在运送拉思塔
I'm hauling Rathtars.

473
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,840
瓜维亚死亡帮来了
Oh, great. It's the Guavian Death Gang.

474
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,660
他们一定是从南图区域就开始追踪我们
They must've tracked us from Nantoon.

475
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,060
拉思塔是什么
What is a rathtar?

476
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:05,740
它们体型很大并且很危险
They are big and they are dangerous.

477
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,500
你听说过特里利亚大屠杀吗
You ever heard of the Trillia massacre?

478
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,840
- 没有 - 挺好的
- No. - Good.

479
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,680
我要送三只到普拉纳国王去
I got three of them going to King Prana.

480
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:13,040
三只 你是怎么把它们弄上船的
Three? How did you get them on board?

481
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:15,500
我们之前人手更多些
We used to have a bigger crew.

482
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:20,430
到下面去 我让你们上来再上来
Get below and stay there until I say so.

483
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:22,150
别打飞船的主意
And don't even think about taking the Falcon.

484
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,300
BB-8怎么办
What about BB-8?

485
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,780
在我甩掉这帮人之前 他跟着我
He stays with me until I get rid of the gang,

486
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,430
之后你们就可以带着他 爱去哪儿去哪儿了
then you can have him back and be on your way.

487
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:28,770
那拉思塔怎么办 你把它们放在哪儿了
What about the Rathtars? Where're you keeping them?

488
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,860
那有一只
There's one.

489
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,130
你打算做什么
What are you going to do?

490
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,320
老样子 按我的方式解决问题
Same thing I always do. Talk my way out of it.

491
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:36,520
你有成功过吗
Do you?

492
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:39,240
当然 次次管用
Yes, I do. Every time.

493
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:59,760
汉・索洛 你死定了
Han Solo, you are a dead man.

494
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:02,650
巴拉-蒂克 有什么问题吗
Bala-Tik. What's the problem?

495
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,560
我们借了你50000块干这趟活儿 这就是问题
The problem is that we loaned you 50,000 for this job.

496
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,720
你能看见他们吗
Can you see them?

497
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,120
看不见
No.

498
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:11,320
我听说你也向坎吉俱乐部借了50000块
I heard you also borrowed 50,000 from Kanjiklub.

499
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:14,170
你知道的 那些小怪物不可信
You know you can't trust those little freaks.

500
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:16,510
咱们都认识多久了
How long we known each other?

501
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:19,030
- 他们有爆能枪 - 有很多
- They have blasters. - A lot of them.

502
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:22,370
时间不长 我们现在想要回那笔钱
Not long. We want our money back now.

503
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:25,550
你觉得捕捉拉思塔很便宜吗 那钱我已经花了
You think hunting Rathtars is cheap? I spent that money.

504
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:28,120
坎吉俱乐部也想要回他们的资金
Kanjiklub wants their investment back too.

505
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,360
我从没和坎吉俱乐部做过交易
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!

506
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:32,710
这话你自己跟坎吉俱乐部说
Tell that to Kanjiklub.

507
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:45,380
塔苏・利奇 很高兴见到你啊
Tasu Leech! Good to see you!

508
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:49,780
你又犯了一个错误 索洛 你就是想赖账
You made another mistake, Solo. This is your intention.

509
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:57,010
兄弟们 我答应好的东西我会给你们的
Boys! You both're gonna get what I promised.

510
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:59,300
我有言而无信过吗
Have I ever not deliver for you before?

511
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:00,400
有啊
Yeah.

512
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,360
两次
Twice.

513
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,690
第二次是什么事
What was the second time?

514
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:07,030
故技重施
Your game is old.

515
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:09,870
在这个星系里不会有人再相信你的骗局了
There's no one in the galaxy left for you to swindle.

516
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:11,960
你也无处可躲
You have nowhere to hide.

517
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:13,640
那个BB机器人
That BB unit.

518
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:17,020
第一秩序正在找的那个机器人 跟它一模一样
The First Order is looking for one just like it.

519
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:22,030
还有两个逃犯
And two fugitives.

520
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:26,390
这事我第一次听说
First time I heard of it.

521
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:28,650
- 搜查这艘运输舰 - 明白
- Search the freighter. - On it.

522
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,390
等等 等等
Wait, wait, wait...

523
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:39,690
如果我们可以把走廊上的防爆门关上 就能把那两帮的人困住
If we close the blast doors in that corridor, we can trap those gangs.

524
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,200
从这里把门关上吗
Close the blast doors from here?

525
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,470
重新设定导火线应该就能行
Resetting the fuses should do it.

526
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:52,960
我有种不好的预感
I got a bad feeling about this.

527
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:54,070
惨了
Oh, no.

528
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:55,560
什么惨了
"Oh no," what?

529
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,190
找错导火线了
Wrong fuses.

530
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:58,430
杀了他们
Kill them!

531
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:00,110
抓住那个机器人
And take the droid!

532
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:27,930
- 这是个错误的决定 - 错大发了
- This was a mistake! - Huge!

533
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:42,330
它们长什么样子
What do they look like?

534
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:49,270
就长那样
They look like that.

535
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:54,120
- 往这走 - 你确定吗
- This way. - Are you sure?

536
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:57,600
不 不 不 不
No! No, no, no.

537
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,030
芬恩
Finn!

538
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:01,490
芬恩
Finn!

539
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:04,390
蕾伊
REY!

540
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,330
别碰我
Get out of here!

541
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,170
蕾伊
Rey!

542
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:15,770
芬恩
Finn!

543
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,230
芬恩
Finn!

544
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:20,370
放开我
Get it off me!

545
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:39,870
滚开 滚开
Get off! Get off!

546
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:42,990
芬恩
Finn!

547
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:45,170
它抓住我了 但是那门
It had me! But the door...

548
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:46,790
真是幸运
That was lucky.

549
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:52,220
我来开门 掩护我
I got the door. Cover us!

550
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:00,220
啊
AAWWW!

551
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,540
丘伊
Chewie!

552
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,500
还好吗
Are you okay?

553
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,700
还好
Yeah.

554
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,400
哇
Wow.

555
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:11,770
快 快
Come on! Come on!

556
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:18,020
- 汉 - 你 把门关上
- Han - You, close the door behind us.

557
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,940
你 照顾丘伊
You, take care of Chewie!

558
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:21,430
啊
Awww!

559
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,530
你干嘛
Hey. Where're you going?

560
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:30,170
昂卡・普拉特在这安装了一个燃油泵
Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump here.

561
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,080
不把它填装好 我们哪也去不了
If we don't prime that, we're not going anywhere..

562
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,240
我恨他
I hate that guy.

563
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:36,740
- 你以前还有副驾驶 - 有一个 现在在后面
- And you could use a co-pilot. - I got one, he's back there.

564
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:40,450
看着推进器 我们要以光速离开这里
Watch the thrusters. We're getting out of here in light speed.

565
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,330
从吊舱内部 这可能吗
From inside of a hanger? Is that even possible?

566
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:45,470
我都是在做完了才问这个问题的
I never ask that question until after I've done it.

567
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,070
这可不是我想象中的一天
This is not how I thought this day was going to go.

568
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:51,220
打开防护盾 后面的人坐好了
Angle the shield. Hang on back there!

569
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:52,870
没问题
No problem!

570
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:04,500
拜托 宝贝 别让我失望
Come on, baby, don't let me down.

571
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:08,200
- 什么来着 - 压缩机
- What? - Compressor.

572
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:19,800
通知第一秩序 他们要的机器人在汉・索洛手里
Inform the First Order that Han Solo has the droid they wanted.

573
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:22,440
它在千年隼号上
And it's aboard the Millennium Falcon.

574
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:35,820
那个机器人很快会被送到抵抗组织
The droid will soon be delivered to the Resistance,

575
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:40,370
带他们找到最后一个绝地武士
leading them to the last Jedi.

576
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:45,310
如果天行者回归
If Skywalker returns,

577
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:49,960
新一代绝地武士就会崛起
the new Jedi will rise.

578
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:52,360
最高领袖 我会负起全责
Supreme Leader, I take full responsibility....

579
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:54,790
将军
General!

580
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:59,200
我们必须要改变战略了
Our strategy must now change.

581
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,440
武器已经准备就绪
The weapon. It is ready.

582
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:03,640
我相信是时候派上用场了
I believe the time has come to use it.

583
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:06,670
我们将摧毁支持抵抗组织的政府
We shall destroy the government that supports the Resistance.

584
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:08,140
共和国政府
The Republic.

585
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,550
没有了朋友的支持 抵抗组织就会变得力量薄弱
Without their friends to protect them, the Resistance will be vulnerable.

586
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:14,610
在他们找到天行者之前拦截他们
And we will stop them before they reach Skywalker.

587
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:16,390
去吧
Go,

588
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:18,390
监督好准备工作
oversee preparations.

589
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:20,790
是 最高领袖
Yes, Supreme Leader.

590
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:28,440
有个人已经觉醒
There has been an awakening.

591
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:30,970
你感觉到了吗
Have you felt it?

592
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:33,800
是的
Yes.

593
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:37,020
还有更多的东西
There's something more.

594
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:42,860
我们要找的机器人在千年隼号上
The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon.

595
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:46,160
在你父亲手中
In the hands of your father,

596
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:50,360
汉・索洛
Han Solo.

597
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:54,410
他对我而言毫无意义
He means nothing to me.

598
00:50:54,440 --> 00:51:00,170
即便是你 伦武士团的大师
Even you, Master of the Knights of Ren,

599
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:03,810
也从未面临过如此挑战
have never faced such a test.

600
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:08,010
承蒙您的培养 我不会受此诱惑的
By the grace of your training, I will not be seduced.

601
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:10,570
我们拭目以待
We shall see.

602
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:15,790
我们拭目以待
We shall see.

603
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:25,680
- 电力超负荷了 - 我能修好
- Electrical overload. - I can fix that.

604
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:27,550
冷却剂泄露了
Coolant's leaking.

605
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:29,580
尝试把辅助电力转移到
Try transferring auxiliary power to...

606
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,770
- 第二燃料箱 - 第二燃料箱
- secondary tank. - Secondary tank.

607
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,190
知道了
I got it.

608
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,670
丘伊 拜托
Chewie, come on!

609
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,600
我需要帮忙制住这个大毛怪
I need help with this giant hairy thing!

610
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:39,370
- 来了 - 别过来
- Coming. - Stop moving!

611
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:40,460
啊
Ahhh!

612
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:42,390
- 丘伊 - 他需要帮助
- Chewie! - He needs help.

613
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:44,480
你要是伤害丘伊 就是和我作对
You hurt Chewie, you're going to deal with me!

614
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:47,610
伤害他 他几乎杀了我六次了
Hurt him? He almost kill me six times!

615
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:49,010
这下好了
Which is fine.

616
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,290
如果超光速引擎爆炸
If this hyperdrive blows,

617
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:53,450
我们将会变成三个不同星系的碎片
there's going to be pieces of us in three different systems.

618
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:57,950
你做了什么
What did you do?

619
00:51:57,970 --> 00:52:00,490
我绕开了压缩机
I bypass the compressor.

620
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:03,930
哈
Huh.

621
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,280
走开 圆球
Move, ball.

622
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:14,590
别那么说 你做得很棒 休息一下
Don't say that. You did great, just rest.

623
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:16,540
做得好 孩子

624
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:17,770

625
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,220
不客气
You're welcome.

626
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:25,350
所以
So.

627
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,510
你们是逃犯 哈
Fugitive, huh?

628
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,990
第一秩序想要那张地图
The First Order wants the map.

629
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:31,990
芬恩是抵抗组织成员
Finn is with the Resistance.

630
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:34,030
我只是一个拾荒者
I'm just a scavenger.

631
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:37,220
让我们看看你拿到了什么
Let's see what you got.

632
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,430
- 可以吗 - 给他看吧
- Should I? - Go ahead.

633
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,700
这张地图并不完整 只是其中一块
This map is not complete, it's just a piece.

634
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:57,210
自从卢克失踪 人们就一直在找他
Ever since Luke disappeared people'd been looking for him.

635
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:59,200
他为什么离开
Why did he leave?

636
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:03,040
他曾经培养了新一代绝地武士
He was training a new generation of Jedi.

637
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:07,490
有个男孩 他的徒弟 背叛了他 摧毁了一切
One boy, an apprentice, turned against him, destroyed it all.

638
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,450
卢克感到很自责
Luke felt responsible.

639
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:13,760
只好远离一切
He just walked away from everything.

640
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:15,450
你知道在他身上发生过什么吗
Do you know what happened to him?

641
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:18,620
有很多谣言和传说
A lot of rumors, stories.

642
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:22,160
了解他的人猜测
People who'd knew him best,

643
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,880
他去寻找第一绝地圣殿了
think he went looking for the first Jedi Temple.

644
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:28,930
绝地武士真的存在吗
The Jedi were real?

645
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,280
我曾经也怀疑过
I used to wonder about that myself.

646
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:34,170
我也曾认为只是一堆胡言乱语
I thought it was a bunch of mumbo jumbo.

647
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:37,120
结合正义与邪恶
A magical power holding together good and evil,

648
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:39,430
黑暗和光明的神奇力量

649
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:42,580
疯狂的是
The crazy thing is...

650
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:47,230
这是真的
It's true.

651
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:51,390
原力 绝地武士
The Force, the Jedi.

652
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:55,240
所有一切
All of it.

653
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,510
都是真的
It's all true.

654
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:05,280
不 你去休息
No, you rest.

655
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:07,270
你想要我帮忙 那你要听我的
You want my help? You're getting it.

656
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:10,410
去见一个老朋友 她会帮你的机器人回家
Going to see an old friend. She'll get your droid home.

657
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:12,300
我们到了
This is our stop.

658
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:33,010
我不知道银河系中居然还有这么多绿色
I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy.

659
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:02,370
嘿 索洛 我不知道我们来这干嘛
Hey, Solo, I'm not sure what we're walking into here.

660
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:04,110
你刚刚叫我索洛
Did you just call me Solo?

661
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:05,860
抱歉 汉・索洛先生
Sorry, Han. Mr. Solo.

662
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:09,370
你应该知道 我可是抵抗组织的大人物
You should know, I'm a big deal in the Resistance,

663
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:11,790
他们真正目标是我
which puts a real target on my back.

664
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:15,780
这里有任何阴谋者吗 像是第一秩序支持者
Are there any conspirators here? Like First Order sympathizers?

665
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:20,080
听着 "大人物" 你有其他问题要解决
Listen, "big deal". You have another problem.

666
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:23,080
女人总是能找出真相
Women always figure out the truth.

667
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:25,810
总是
Always.

668
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:33,330
你会需要这个的
You might need this.

669
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:35,900
我自己能搞定
I think I can handle myself.

670
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:38,600
我知道 这就是我为什么把它给你
I know you do. That's why I'm giving it to you.

671
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:40,070
拿着
Take it.

672
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,220
你知道怎么使用吗

674
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:47,410
实际上远远不止
A little bit more truer than that.

675
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,370
学无止境
You got a lot to learn.

676
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,170
你叫什么名字
You got a name?

677
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,950
蕾伊
Rey.

678
00:55:54,270 --> 00:55:55,840
蕾伊

679
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,600
我一直想发展一些船员 蕾伊
I've been thinking about bringing on some more crew, Rey.

680
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,580
一个二副 能帮上忙的
A second mate. Someone to help out.

681
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:06,970
能和丘伊和我保持步调一致 能赏识千年隼号
Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me, who appreciates the Falcon.

682
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:08,790
你在给我提供工作吗
Are you offering me a job?

683
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:11,680
我对你不会很好 也不会付很多钱
I wouldn't be nice to you. I don't pay much.

684
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:13,620
你在招募我吗
You're offering me a job?

685
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:16,790
我正在考虑
I'm thinking about it.

686
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:21,300
怎么样
Well?

687
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:28,940
你这么说我真是受宠若惊 但我必须回家
If you are, I'd be flattered. But I have to go home.

688
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,850
回哪儿 贾库
Where? Jakku?

689
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:32,980
我已经离开太久了
I've already been away too long.

690
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,900
丘伊 好好检查一下飞船
Chewie, checkout the ship as best you can.

691
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:44,150
那真遗憾 丘伊有点喜欢你呢
It's too bad. Chewie kinda likes you.

692
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,510
索洛 我们来这干什么
Solo, why are we here again?

693
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:51,080
- 确保你的机器人能在一艘干净的船上 - 干净
- To get your droid on a clean ship. - Clean?

694
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:54,400
你觉得我和丘伊找到猎鹰号是运气使然吗
Do you think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon?

695
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:58,700
如果我们能在扫描仪上找到它 第一秩序也离我们不远了
If we can find it on our scanners, the First Order is not far behind.

696
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:01,440
你想把BB-8送回抵抗组织
You want to get BB-8 to the Resistance.

697
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,450
玛兹・卡纳塔就是我们最好选择
Maz Kanata is our best bet.

698
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,100
我们能相信她吗
We can trust her, right?

699
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:07,660
放心 孩子
Relax, kid.

700
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:11,070
她开这个酒馆一千多年了
She's run this watering hole for a thousand years.

701
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:14,740
玛兹有点古怪 所以由我来跟她谈
Maz is a bit of an acquired taste, so, let me do the talking.

702
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:16,540
无论你们做什么 别盯着看
And whatever you do, don't stare.

703
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:18,000
- 看什么 - 看什么
- At what? - At what?

704
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:20,190
任何一切
Any of it.

705
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:43,540
汉・索洛
Han Solo!

706
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:48,510
哦 老天
Oh, boy

707
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:50,310
嘿 玛兹
Hey, Maz.

708
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,470
我的男朋友呢
Where's my boyfriend?

709
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:59,480
- 丘伊在猎鹰号上工作呢 - 我喜欢那个伍基人
- Chewie's working in the Falcon. - I like that Wookiee.

710
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:03,170
我猜你急需一些东西
I assume you need something. Desperately.

711
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,080
跟我来吧
Let's get to it.

712
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,800
我一会回来
I'll be back.

713
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,970
发现抵抗者
Resistance spotted...

714
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,260
你们要找的机器人也在这
and your lost droid is here too.

715
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:42,930
通知第一秩序 我找到机器人了
Inform the First Order... I found the droid.

716
00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:00,320
原谅我
Forgive me.

717
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:04,990
我又一次感受到它了
I feel it again.

718
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:10,160
把我拉向光明的力量
The pull to the light.

719
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:15,240
最高领袖察觉到了
The Supreme Commander senses it.

720
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,900
请再次给我展示
Show me again.

721
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,470
黑暗的力量
The power of the darkness.

722
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:24,230
我绝不会让任何事情阻挡我们的道路
And I will let nothing stand in our way.

723
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:26,770
给我展示
Show me...

724
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,530
外公
... Grandfather.

725
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:36,800
我会完成你未尽的事业的
And I will finish what you started.

726
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,420
一张能找到
A map...

727
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,700
天行者的地图
to Skywalker himself?

728
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:55,960
你打算重出江湖了
You are right back in the mess.

729
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:59,310
玛兹 我需要你把这个机器人送到莱娅那
Maz, I need you to get this droid to Leia.

730
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:02,950
不行
No.

731
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:08,130
你已经远离这场战斗太久了
You've been running away from this fight for too long.

732
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:09,610
汉
Han.

733
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:14,170
回家吧
Go home.

734
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:15,630
莱娅不会想见我的
Leia doesn't want to see me.

735
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:18,490
拜托 我们来这就是寻求你的帮助的
Please, we came here for your help.

736
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:20,910
什么战斗
What fight?

737
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,260
唯一的一场战斗
The only fight

738
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:25,520
抵抗黑暗组织
against the dark side.

739
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:30,220
古往今来 我已经见识过太多的邪恶力量
Through the ages, I've seen evil take many forms.

740
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,560
西斯人 帝国军团
The Sith. The Empire.

741
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:36,400
现在 是第一秩序
Today, it is the First Order.

742
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:39,600
他们的阴影遍布整个银河系
Their shadows spreading across the galaxy.

743
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:41,410
我们必须面对他们
We must face them.

744
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:43,610
和他们战斗
Fight them.

745
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,260
我们所有人
All of us.

746
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,270
不能和第一秩序对抗
There is no fighting against the First Order.

747
01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:49,150
我们不可能战胜他们
Not one we can win.

748
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:50,870
看看周围
Look around.

749
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:53,240
没机会了 我们早已被认出来了
There's no chance we haven't been recognized us already.

750
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:56,140
我敢打赌第一秩序已经在来的路上了
I bet you the First Order is on their way right...

751
01:00:56,970 --> 01:00:58,400
这是什么
What's this?

752
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:01,230
你干什么
What are you doing?

753
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,240
索洛 她在干什么
Solo, what is she doing?

754
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:09,210
我不知道 但肯定不是好事
I don't know, but it ain't good.

755
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:14,860
如果你活得够久 就能通过眼睛能看透不同的人
If you live long enough, you see the same eyes in different people.

756
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:20,010
我看到了一个想要逃跑的人
I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run.

757
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:25,160
你对我一无所知
You don't know a thing about me.

758
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:29,470
我从哪来 见过什么
Where I'm from. What I've seen.

759
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:32,700
没人比我更了解第一秩序
You don't know the First Order like I do.

760
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:35,200
他们会把我们屠杀殆尽
They will slaughter us.

761
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:37,760
我们都要逃
We all need to run.

762
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:47,610
看到那两个人了吗
You see those two?

763
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:50,970
他们会把货物运往外环星域交易
They'll trade work for transportation to the Outer Rim.

764
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,740
在那 你可以消失
There, you can disappear.

765
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,170
芬恩
Finn?

766
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:58,360
跟我一起走
Come with me.

767
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:01,010
BB-8怎么办 我们还没有完成任务
What about BB-8? We're not done yet.

768
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:03,040
我们得把它送回你们基地
We have to get him back to your base.

769
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:05,810
你以为呢 他不行的
You think? He can't.

770
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,270
我不能
I can't.

771
01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:19,510
留着吧 孩子
Keep it, kid.

772
01:02:29,170 --> 01:02:31,210
那个女孩是谁
Who's the girl?

773
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:35,520
- 什么 这是什么 - 让他先说
- What? What is it? - Let him speak first.

774
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:37,920
有人说你们可以把我带到外环星域
I was told you can get me to the Outer Rim.

775
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:39,590
你在做什么
What are you doing?

776
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,410
别丢下我
Don't leave without me.

777
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:47,190
你不能一走了之 我不会让你走的
You can't just go. I won't let you.

778
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:48,470
我不是你想的那样
I'm not who you think I am.

779
01:02:48,490 --> 01:02:51,390
- 芬恩 你在说什么 - 我不是抵抗组织的
- Finn, what are you talking about? - I'm not Resistance.

780
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:53,180
我不是英雄
I'm not a hero.

781
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,040
我是一个风暴兵
I'm a Stormtrooper.

782
01:02:58,990 --> 01:03:02,760
和他们一样 我从一个永远都不会知道的家庭被带走
Like all of them, I was taken from my family I'll never know.

783
01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:05,240
被培养训练去杀戮
And raised to do one thing.

784
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:08,930
在我第一场战斗中 我做了一个选择
In my first battle, I made a choice.

785
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,060
我不想杀他们
I wasn't going to kill for them.

786
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,320
所以我逃跑了 正好遇见了你
So I ran, right into you.

787
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:19,580
从来没有人像你那样看我
You looked at me like no one ever had.

788
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:24,170
我为自己感到羞耻
I was ashamed of what I was.

789
01:03:26,530 --> 01:03:28,790
但是 我受够了第一秩序
But, I'm done with the First Order.

790
01:03:28,790 --> 01:03:30,860
我永远都不要回去
I'm never going back.

791
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:35,160
蕾伊 跟我一起走吧
Rey, come with me.

792
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:37,050
别走
Don't go.

793
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:44,110
照顾好自己
Take care of yourself.

794
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:46,950
拜托了
Please.

795
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,650
不要
No!

796
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:06,040
不要
No!

797
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:21,830
别走 回来
No! Come back!

798
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:24,320
不
No!

799
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,560
回来
Come back!

800
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:43,030
回来
Come back!

801
01:04:52,610 --> 01:04:54,640
别走
No!

802
01:05:45,030 --> 01:05:46,840
别走
No!

803
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:48,800
他的能量
His energy...

804
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:16,650
别走
No!

805
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:18,980
回来
Come back!

806
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:20,860
安静 小丫头
Quiet, girl.

807
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:23,160
别走
No!

808
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:27,990
蕾伊
Rey?

809
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:35,740
这是你成为绝地武士的第一步
These are your first steps.

810
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,520
刚才那是什么
What was that?

811
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,200
我不该贸然进来的
I shouldn't gone in here.

812
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:49,780
那是卢克的光剑
That lightsaber was Luke's.

813
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:51,560
在那之前属于他父亲
And his father's before him.

814
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:55,190
现在 它属于你了
And now, it call's to you.

815
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:57,350
我必须要回贾库
I have to get back to Jakku.

816
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:59,350
汉跟我说了
Han told me.

817
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:11,040
孩子啊 我从你的眼睛里看出来了
Dear child, I see your eyes.

818
01:07:11,070 --> 01:07:13,950
你已经知道真相了
You already know the truth.

819
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:17,180
你在贾库等待的人
Whoever you're waiting for in Jakku.

820
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:20,640
他们再也不会回来了
They're never coming back.

821
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:30,390
只有一个人例外
But, there's someone who still could.

822
01:07:32,350 --> 01:07:33,970
卢克
Luke.

823
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,720
你苦苦追寻的归宿不在过去
The belonging you seek is not behind you,

824
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:39,510
而在未来
it is ahead.

825
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:43,260
我不是绝地武士 但我了解原力
I'm no Jedi, but I know the Force.

826
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:48,540
它会在生命体之间存在与流动
It moves through and surrounds every living thing.

827
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:51,950
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes.

828
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:55,010
用心感受
Feel it .

829
01:07:55,390 --> 01:07:57,700
光线
The light...

830
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:00,180
无处不在
it's always been there.

831
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,610
它会指引你
It will guide you.

832
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:07,280
拿上那把光剑吧
The saber. Take it.

833
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:12,400
我绝不会再碰它了
I'm never touching that thing again.

834
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:14,920
我不想牵扯进来
I don't want any part of this.

835
01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:44,950
今天是共和国的末日
Today is the end of the Republic.

836
01:08:45,870 --> 01:08:51,750
是无秩序政权终结的日子
The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder.

837
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:56,720
在这个特别的时刻 地处遥远星系的
At this very moment in a system far from here,

838
01:08:56,720 --> 01:09:01,600
新共和国欺骗了我们
the New Republic lies to the galaxy

839
01:09:01,630 --> 01:09:09,620
秘密支持抵抗组织的叛徒们的谋反行为
while secretly supporting the treachery of the rogues of the Resistance.

840
01:09:09,630 --> 01:09:12,980
我们将用脚下这个你们亲手建造的毁灭性武器
This fierce machine which you have built,

841
01:09:12,990 --> 01:09:17,750
将共和国和他们视为珍宝的舰队
upon which we stand will bring an end to the Senate,

842
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:20,380
送上西天

我看见你一直在跑 你没事吧

- BB-8 - 不

861
01:11:32,450 --> 01:11:35,800
你不能这样 你必须得回去 你太重要了
No, you can't. You have to go back, you're too important.

862
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:37,730

865
01:11:58,850 --> 01:12:00,680
你从哪儿得到的
Where'd you get that?

866
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:04,760
问得好 改天给你解释

869
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:45,180
FN-417 站在别动

875
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:28,430
- 我负责牵制住他们 - 但愿他们找不到我们
- I'll try to fight them off. - I hope they won't find us.

876
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:30,090
但愿如此
I hope so too.

877
01:13:42,150 --> 01:13:44,120
跟上 丘伊

TK-338, we have targets in custody.

887

We have incoming in 28.6.

888

所有人集合 重复 所有人集合

找掩护 守住中心战场
Take cover and cover our mid field position!

891

是抵抗组织
It's the Resistance.

892
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:42,810
朝着他们开火 这些暴徒没什么可怕的
Go straight ahead at them! Don't let these thugs scare you!

893
01:15:42,810 --> 01:15:44,970
- 收到 - 一起冲 波
- Copy that. - We're with you, Poe.

好耶
Yeah!

896
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,390
这才是真正的飞行员
That's one hell of a pilot!

897
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:45,040
我听过太多关于你的传闻
The girl I heard so much about.

898
01:17:56,780 --> 01:17:58,310
那个机器人
The droid.

899
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:02,380
在哪里
Where is it?

900
01:18:07,450 --> 01:18:09,420
我们急需空中支援
We're going to need air support.

901

地图
The map.

902
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:21,440
你已经看过了
You've seen it.

903
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:24,750
长官 抵抗组织派飞机过来了
Sir, Resistance fighters.

904
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:26,650
我们需要更多人手
We need more troops.

905
01:18:26,670 --> 01:18:28,570
全军撤退
Pull the division out.

906
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:32,380
不用找机器人了 我们已经找到目标了
Forget the droid. We have what we need.

907
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:40,700
撤退
Fall back!

908
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:56,650
不
No!

909
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:02,600

不 不
No! No!

911
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:10,080
蕾伊
Rey!

912
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:30,490
他把她带走了 你看见了吗
He took her. Did you see it?

913
01:19:30,730 --> 01:19:32,170
她被带走了
He took her. She's gone.

914
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,150
好了 我知道了
Yeah, yeah, I know.

915
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:44,330
这边
Come on.

916
01:19:57,730 --> 01:19:58,890
天哪
Goodness!

917
01:19:58,910 --> 01:20:02,880
汉・索洛 还记得我吗 C-3PO
Han Solo! It is I, C-3PO.

918
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:06,080
换了个红胳膊后你可能不认得我了
You probably don't recognize me because of the red arm.

919
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:08,810
快看这是谁 你看见
Look who it is! Did you see who...?

920
01:20:08,830 --> 01:20:11,270
哦 呃
Oh. Eh.

921
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:15,790
恕我无礼 殿下 我错了 将军
Excuse me, Princess... General. I'm sorry.

922
01:20:15,820 --> 01:20:18,230
- 走吧 BB-8 他们等着呢 - 你的胳膊真特别
- Come on, BB-8, they're waiting. - What an unusual arm you have.

923
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:21,510
我得赶紧换上正确的胳膊
Yes, I must have my proper arm reinstall.

924
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:24,780
你换发型了
You changed your hair.

925
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:28,790
还是那件外套
Same jacket.

926
01:20:29,650 --> 01:20:31,960
不 这件是新的
No, new jacket.

927
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:46,120
我看见他了
I saw him.

928
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,640
莱娅 我看见我们的儿子了
Leia, I saw our son.

929
01:20:51,150 --> 01:20:52,860
他在那儿
He was here.

930
01:21:33,530 --> 01:21:34,830
嘿
Hey!

931
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:38,010
波
Poe!

932
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,590
我的好朋友 BB-8
BB-8, my friend.

933
01:21:40,610 --> 01:21:42,910
见到你真高兴
Good to see you.

934
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:44,360
芬恩救了你 他在哪里
Finn saved you? Where is he?

935
01:21:44,380 --> 01:21:45,400
在那儿
There.

936
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:46,650
波
Poe.

937
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:49,030
哦 不
Oh, no.

938
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:50,920
波・达默龙 你还活着
Poe Dameron, you're alive?

939
01:21:51,150 --> 01:21:53,320
- 兄弟 你也没事 - 你去哪里了
- Buddy! So are you! - What happened to you?

940
01:21:53,410 --> 01:21:54,740
我被爆炸冲击波震飞
I got thrown from the crash.

941
01:21:54,820 --> 01:21:56,740
我在夜里醒来之后 既没看见你 也没看见飞船 身边什么都没有
I woke up at night. No you. No ship. Nothing.

942
01:21:56,770 --> 01:21:59,530
- BB-8说是你救了他 - 不 不只是我
- BB-8 says that you saved him. - No, no, no. It wasn't just me.

943
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:02,840
你替我完成了使命 芬恩 这是我的外套
You completed my mission, Finn... That's my jacket.

944
01:22:02,860 --> 01:22:05,240
- 没错 - 不 不
- Oh. - No no no...

945
01:22:05,270 --> 01:22:07,330
穿着吧 很适合你
Keep it. It suits you.

946
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:09,760
芬恩 你是个好人
You're a good man, Finn.

947
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,880
波 我需要你的帮助
Poe, I need your help.

948
01:22:13,890 --> 01:22:17,210
PZ-4CO 报告通信情况
PZ-4CO, report to communications.

949
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:21,960
奥加纳长官
General Organa.

950
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:24,910
抱歉打搅了 这是芬恩
I'm sorry to interrupt. This is Finn.

951
01:22:24,930 --> 01:22:27,900
- 他想跟您谈谈 - 正好我也要和他谈谈
- He needs to talk to you. - And I need to talk to him.

952
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,810
你所做的一切真是勇气可嘉
That was incredibly brave, what you did.

953
01:22:29,830 --> 01:22:32,240
脱离第一秩序 救下这个年轻人的命
Renouncing the First Order, saving this man's life.

954
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:34,290
谢谢您 夫人 但是我的一个朋友被抓走了
Thank you, ma'am. But a friend of mine was taken prisoner.

955
01:22:34,310 --> 01:22:36,320
汉跟我说了那个女孩的事情
Han told me about the girl.

956
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:37,480
对此深表遗憾
I'm sorry.

957
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:39,860
芬恩之前在基地工作过 他熟悉
Finn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the Hosnian system,

958
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:41,380
摧毁霍斯尼亚星系的武器
he worked on the base.

959
01:22:41,410 --> 01:22:43,210
你知道的一切对我们将会非常重要
We're just good for anything you can tell us.

960
01:22:43,230 --> 01:22:45,820
我的朋友就被带去那里了 我得尽快赶过去
That's where my friend was taken. I got to get there fast.

961
01:22:45,850 --> 01:22:47,950
我乐意提供一切资源
And I will do everything I can to help, but first

962
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:50,390
但你得先把知道的都告诉我们
you need to tell us all you know.

963
01:22:52,910 --> 01:22:55,410
你一定很痛苦
That sounds very scary.

964
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:59,780
你一定很勇敢
You must be so brave.

965
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:04,280
长官 我很遗憾的通知您
General, I regret to inform you but

966
01:23:04,310 --> 01:23:07,570
从BB-8中读取的地图数据并不完整
this map recovered from BB-8 is only partially complete.

967
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:11,390
更糟的是 这部分数据无法和数据库中的任何一副地图匹配
And even worse, it matches no charted system on record.

968
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:15,780
我们还是无法准确定位卢克的位置
We simply do not have enough information to locate Master Luke.

969
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:19,450
我太天真了 居然觉得能把卢克带回家
We are so foolish to think I could find Luke and bring him home.

970
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:20,590
莱娅
Leia.

971
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:21,870
别这样
Don't do that.

972
01:23:21,870 --> 01:23:22,880
怎样
Do what?

973
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:24,570
什么都别做
Anything.

974
01:23:25,530 --> 01:23:27,140
她就是这样
Princesses.

975
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:30,240
我只是想帮忙
I'm trying to be helpful.

976
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:33,630
你什么时候帮过忙 除了死星那次
When did that ever help? And don't say the Death Star.

977
01:23:40,410 --> 01:23:42,850
R2 我需要你的帮助
R2, I need your help.

978
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:48,620
R2 醒醒
Wake up, R2.

979
01:23:48,650 --> 01:23:51,370
BB-8 你这么做毫无用处
BB-8. You're wasting your time.

980
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:52,440
他可能有地图数据
He might have the map.

981
01:23:52,470 --> 01:23:56,100
谁都不能肯定R2的备份数据里有剩余的地图信息
It is very doubtful that R2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data.

982
01:23:56,130 --> 01:23:58,020
- 我们不能把它叫醒吗 - 恐怕不能
- Can't we wake him? - I am afraid not.

983
01:23:58,020 --> 01:24:02,700
卢克大师走了之后R2-D2就一直处在低电量模式
R2-D2 has been in low power mode ever since Master Luke went away.

984
01:24:04,730 --> 01:24:08,420
他可能永远都醒不过来了
Sadly, he may never be his own self again.

985
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:09,730
可怜的R2
Poor R2.

986
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:11,420
听我说好吗
Listen to me, will you?

987
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:14,590
我知道每次你
I know every time you...

988
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,310
每次你看着我 你都会想起他
Every time you look me, you're reminded of him.

989
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:21,550
你觉得我能忘掉他吗
Do you think I want to forget him?

990
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:23,300
我希望他回来
I want him back.

991
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:25,710
那个时候我们已经尽力了
There's nothing more we could have done

992
01:24:27,030 --> 01:24:28,570
他身上有太多外祖父的影子
There's too much Vader in him.

993
01:24:28,590 --> 01:24:31,500
所以我才希望卢克能去训练他
That's why I wanted him to be trained with Luke.

994
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:35,190
我本不该把他送走 从那时候起我就失去了他
I just never should had sent him away, that’s when I lost him.

995
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:38,420
我也失去了你
That's when I lost you both.

996
01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:43,840
我们只能用各自的方式去弥补这件事
We both had to deal with it in our own way.

997
01:24:44,010 --> 01:24:47,320
我回去做我唯一擅长的事情了
I went back to the only thing I was only good at.

998
01:24:47,470 --> 01:24:49,220
我们都一样
We both did.

999
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:54,150
我们再也找不回儿子了
We lost our son. Forever.

1000
01:24:54,170 --> 01:24:55,360
不
No.

1001
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:56,930
是斯诺克的错
It was Snoke.

1002
01:24:56,950 --> 01:24:59,700
他把我们的儿子堕入黑暗
He seduced our son to the dark side.

1003
01:24:59,730 --> 01:25:02,230
但我们还有机会救他
But we can still save him.

1004
01:25:02,260 --> 01:25:03,830
我
Me.

1005
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:05,890
你
You.

1006
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:08,550
如果卢克都找不到他 我怎么可能做到
If Luke couldn't reach him, how could I?

1007
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:10,660
卢克是绝地武士
Luke is a Jedi.

1008
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:13,520
你是他的父亲
You're his father.

1009
01:25:15,650 --> 01:25:19,280
我相信他还是心存善念的
There's still light in him, I know it.

1010
01:25:19,310 --> 01:25:20,930
长官
General.

1011
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:24,580
侦查兵报告敌军来袭
The reconnaissance report on the enemy base is coming.

1012
01:25:50,610 --> 01:25:52,190
这是哪里
Where am I?

1013
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:55,470
这是我的地盘
You're my guest.

1014
01:25:55,470 --> 01:25:56,640
其他人呢
Where are the others?

1015
01:25:56,670 --> 01:26:02,260
你居然把杀手 叛徒 和小偷称作你的朋友
Do you mean the murderers, traitors and thieves, you called friends?

1016
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:05,400
你应该庆幸我不知道他们在哪儿
You'll be relieved to hear I have no idea.

1017
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:09,480
你还是想置我于死地
You still want to kill me.

1018
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:13,450
除非你摘下那个丑陋的面具
That happens when you're being haunting by a contort mask.

1019
01:26:38,370 --> 01:26:40,300
跟我说说那个机器人
Tell me about the droid.

1020
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:44,430
他属于BB系列 由硒电池驱动 带有热扫描器
He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator...

1021
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:46,630
携带一部分的地图数据
Carrying a section of a navigation chart.

1022
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:48,150
我们有余下的部分
We have the rest.

1023
01:26:48,170 --> 01:26:51,010
从帝国档案中恢复出来的 但是仍然缺最后一部分
Recovered from the archives of the Empire, but we need the last piece.

1024
01:26:51,030 --> 01:26:53,960
你居然说服那个机器人展示给你看了
Yet somehow you convinced the droid to show it to you.

1025
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:56,580
你
You,

1026
01:26:57,530 --> 01:26:59,320
一个拾荒者
a scavenger.

1027
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:03,440
你该知道我可以知道任何事
You know I can take whatever I want.

1028
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:11,430
你太孤单了
You're so lonely.

1029
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,200
害怕离别
So afraid to leave.

1030
01:27:19,140 --> 01:27:22,420
在夜里绝望地入睡
At night, desperate to sleep.

1031
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:27,020
想象一下大海
Imagine an ocean.

1032
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:29,250
我看见了
I see it.

1033
01:27:30,170 --> 01:27:32,370
我看见了岛屿
I see the island.

1034
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,410
和汉・索洛
And Han Solo.

1035
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:42,480
你把他当做从未谋面的父亲
You feel like he's a father you never had.

1036
01:27:42,910 --> 01:27:44,160
他让你失望了
He would have disappointed you.

1037
01:27:44,190 --> 01:27:46,350
把手从我的脑袋上拿开
Get out of my head!

1038
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,900
我知道你见过地图了
I know you've seen the map.

1039
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:51,610
就在你的脑子里
It's in there.

1040
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:54,190
现在你得把它展现给我
And now you'll give it to me.

1041
01:28:01,970 --> 01:28:04,460
别害怕 我能感受到
Don't be afraid. I feel it too.

1042
01:28:06,580 --> 01:28:09,160
我不会给你展示任何东西的
I'm not giving you anything.

1043
01:28:09,690 --> 01:28:11,080
走着瞧
We'll see.

1044
01:28:51,030 --> 01:28:52,460
你
You...

1045
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:54,570
你害怕
you're afraid...

1046
01:28:56,860 --> 01:29:00,680
永远都没法和达斯・维德一样强大
that you will never be as strong as Darth Vader!

1047
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:11,090
这个拾荒者
This scavenger

1048
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:12,480
居然能反抗你
resisted you!

1049
01:29:12,510 --> 01:29:14,230
她原力亲和力很强
She is strong with the Force.

1050
01:29:14,260 --> 01:29:16,140
虽然没经过训练 但是潜力无穷
Untrained, but stronger than she knows.

1051
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:17,430
那个机器人呢
And the droid?

1052
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:20,770
伦觉得它对我们没利用价值了
Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us.

1053
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:23,880
有那个女孩就够了
That the girl, is all we needed.

1054
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:27,430
所以那个机器人应该已经回到敌方的手上了
As a result, the Droid is most likely been returned to the hands of the enemy.

1055
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:29,090
他们应该已经得到地图了
They may have the map already.

1056
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:33,100
我们一定要赶在抵抗组织找到天行者之前干掉他们
Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker.

1057
01:29:33,130 --> 01:29:34,960
我们知道他们的位置
We have their location.

1058
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:38,350
他们的侦查队回到伊利尼姆星系时被我们追踪了
We tracked their reconnaissance team to the Ileenium System.

1059
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:40,000
干得好
Good.

1060
01:29:40,030 --> 01:29:43,160
然后我们要一举消灭他们
Then we will crash them once and for all.

1061
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:45,430
准备好武器
Prepare the weapon.

1062
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:48,020
至尊领袖 我能从那个女孩那里拿到地图数据
Supreme Leader, I can get the map from the girl.

1063
01:29:48,020 --> 01:29:50,640
只要您给我一些指引
I just need your guidance.

1064
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:56,290
如果你说的关于这个女孩的是真的
If what you say about this girl is true...

1065
01:29:56,320 --> 01:30:01,470
把她带来见我
Bring her to me.

1066
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:17,150
你会替我解开枷锁
You will remove these restraints

1067
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:21,040
然后打开门离开这里
and leave this cell with the door open.

1068
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:25,880
你说什么
What did you say?

1069
01:30:28,690 --> 01:30:30,210
你会替我解开枷锁
You will remove these restraints

1070
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:33,470
然后打开门离开这里
and leave this cell with the door open.

1071
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,390
我会加固这些枷锁
I will tighten those restraints,

1072
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,880
愚蠢的拾荒者
scavenger scum!

1073
01:30:57,490 --> 01:30:59,140
你会替我解开枷锁
You will remove these restraints

1074
01:30:59,170 --> 01:31:02,210
然后打开门离开这里
and leave this cell with the door open.

1075
01:31:05,330 --> 01:31:06,800
我会解开枷锁
I will remove these restraints

1076
01:31:06,820 --> 01:31:09,470
然后打开门离开这里
and leave this cell with the door open.

1077
01:31:17,630 --> 01:31:19,040
你会丢下你的武器
And you'll drop your gun.

1078
01:31:19,060 --> 01:31:21,470
我会丢下我的武器
And I'll drop my gun.

1079
01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:36,970
不
No.

1080
01:31:38,740 --> 01:31:40,690
警卫
Guards!

1081
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:44,640
警卫
Guards!

1082
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:50,820
开始装载武器
Begin charging the weapon.

1083
01:31:50,850 --> 01:31:53,940
好的 长官 武器装载中
Yes, sir. Weapon charging.

1084
01:32:12,590 --> 01:32:13,860
斯纳普的侦察飞行器传来的
The scan Data from Snap's

1085
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:16,150
扫描数据证实了芬恩的报告
reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's report.

1086
01:32:16,170 --> 01:32:17,500
他们在星球内部建造了
They somehow created a hyper

1087
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:19,810
某种超光速武器
lightspeed weapon built within the planet itself.

1088
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,940
激光炮吗
A laser cannon?

1089
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:22,870
我们不知道怎么形容此种规模的武器
We're not sure how to describe a weapon of this scale.

1090
01:32:22,890 --> 01:32:24,170
又是一颗死星
It's another Death Star.

1091
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:27,850
那么简单就好了 上校 这个是死星
I wish that were the case, Major. This was the Death Star.

1092
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:32,650
而这个 是弑星者基地
And this, is Starkiller base.

1093
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:33,880
所以 它很大
So, it's big.

1094
01:32:33,910 --> 01:32:37,230
这种规模的武器的能源问题是怎么解决的
How is it possible to power up a weapon of that size?

1095
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:40,020
他们用的是太阳能
They uses the power of the sun.

1096
01:32:40,590 --> 01:32:43,810
太阳能会随着武器装载而渐渐耗尽 直到太阳消失
As the weapon is charge, the sun is drained until it disappears.

1097
01:32:43,830 --> 01:32:45,080
夫人
Ma'am.

1098
01:32:46,820 --> 01:32:50,640
第一秩序现在正在重新装载他们的武器
The First Order charging their weapon again, now.

1099
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:52,520
下次目标是我们的星系
Our system is the next charge.

1100
01:32:52,540 --> 01:32:55,200
我的天哪 没有共和国的舰队帮助 我们就完了
Oh, my. Without the Republic fleet, we're doom.

1101
01:32:55,230 --> 01:32:57,290
好吧 我们把它炸掉怎么样
Okay. How do we blow it up?

1102
01:32:57,320 --> 01:32:59,510
- 总有办法能做到的 - 汉说的没错
- There is always a way to do that. - Han's right.

1103
01:32:59,540 --> 01:33:02,150
要成功装载规模如此大的武器
In order for that amount of power to be contained,

1104
01:33:02,170 --> 01:33:04,680
基地必须有某种热振荡器
that base has to have some kind of thermal oscillator.

1105
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:07,490
有一个 在第四十七区域
There is one. Precinct 47.

1106
01:33:07,510 --> 01:33:08,770
这里
Here.

1107
01:33:08,770 --> 01:33:10,960
如果我们能毁掉这个振荡器
If we can destroy that oscillator,

1108
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:14,030
就可能会破坏武器核心 削弱武器力量
it might destabilize the core and cripple the weapon.

1109
01:33:14,050 --> 01:33:15,160
或许能摧毁星球
Maybe the planet.

1110
01:33:15,180 --> 01:33:15,780
我们会去那里
We'll go in there,

1111
01:33:15,780 --> 01:33:17,410
朝振荡器和接触到的一切发起攻击
we'll hit that oscillator with everything we got.

1112
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:20,740
他们有战舰无法穿过的保护罩
They have defensive shields that our ships cannot penetrate.

1113
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:22,720
我们会破坏保护罩
We disable the shields.

1114
01:33:22,740 --> 01:33:24,340
孩子 你在那工作过
Kid, you worked there.

1115
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:26,520
- 你知道些什么吗 - 我可以做到
- What do you got? - I can do it.

1116
01:33:26,540 --> 01:33:27,760
我喜欢这家伙
I like this guy.

1117
01:33:27,780 --> 01:33:31,320
我可以关掉保护罩 但我必须在那颗星球上
I can seal the shields, but I have to be there, on the planet.

1118
01:33:31,350 --> 01:33:33,610
- 我们送你去 - 汉 你要怎么做
- We'll get you there. - Han, how?

1119
01:33:33,630 --> 01:33:35,650
如果我告诉你 你不会喜欢的
If I told you, you wouldn't like it

1120
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:37,100
所以 我们关掉保护罩
So, we disable the shields,

1121
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:40,420
拿下振荡器 然后炸掉大炮
we take out the oscillator and we blow up the big gun.

1122
01:33:41,090 --> 01:33:42,850
好了 走吧
Alright, let's go!

1123
01:34:04,450 --> 01:34:07,620
丘伊 检查一下热分摊情况 来吧 走了
Chewie, check that thermal capitator. Come on, let's go!

1124
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:10,000
小心点那些东西 那可是炸弹
Hey, be careful with those. They're explosives.

1125
01:34:10,030 --> 01:34:11,130
还要你说啊
Now, you tell me?

1126
01:34:11,150 --> 01:34:14,100
你知道吗 不管我们怎么吵架
You know? No matter how much we fought,

1127
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:18,110
我一直都不喜欢看着你离开
I always hated watching you leave.

1128
01:34:18,130 --> 01:34:19,960
这就是我做到的原因
That's why I did it

1129
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:22,580
所以你会想我的
So you'd miss me.

1130
01:34:24,890 --> 01:34:26,600
我确实向你
I did miss you.

1131
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:31,300
也不算很差劲吧 是吗
It wasn't all bad, was it? Huh?

1132
01:34:31,410 --> 01:34:34,730
有一些算是... 挺好的
Some of it was... good.

1133
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:36,240
非常好
Pretty good.

1134
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:41,740
有些事情是不会变的
Some things never change.

1135
01:34:41,770 --> 01:34:45,240
是啊 你还是让我疯狂
True. You still drive me crazy.

1136
01:34:54,220 --> 01:34:56,420
如果你见到我们的儿子
If you see our son,

1137
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:00,220
带他回家
bring him home.

1138
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:10,060
长官 短枪718的传感器被触发 我们在搜索这个区域
Sir. Sensors triggered in Hanger 718. We're searching the area.

1139
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:12,240
她才刚开始试验自己的力量
She's just beginning to test her powers.

1140
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:16,680
越晚找到她 她就越危险
The longer it takes to find her, the more dangerous she becomes.

1141
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:32,300
我们要怎么进去
How're we getting in?

1142
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:34,320
他们的保护罩有极小的刷新率
Their shields have a fractional refresh rate.

1143
01:35:34,350 --> 01:35:35,730
能阻止所有慢于光速的
It keeps anything traveling

1144
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:37,980
飞行器通过
slower than lightspeed from getting through.

1145
01:35:38,010 --> 01:35:40,900
我们要以光速着陆吗
We're making our landing approach at lightspeed?

1146
01:35:41,210 --> 01:35:43,090
丘伊 做好准备
Chewie, get ready.

1147
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:46,120
就是现在
And... Now!

1148
01:35:49,420 --> 01:35:51,580
我已经在提升高度了
I am pulling up!

1149
01:35:58,020 --> 01:36:00,970
再高一点他们就会发现我们了
I get any higher, they'll see us!

1150
01:36:22,110 --> 01:36:24,290
长官 没找到拿着短枪718的她
Sir, she was not found in Hanger 718,

1151
01:36:24,290 --> 01:36:25,950
但所有部队都戒严了
but all troops are on alert.

1152
01:36:25,970 --> 01:36:27,430
把所有的短枪都锁定
Put every hanger on lockdown.

1153
01:36:27,460 --> 01:36:30,340
她会想要偷一搜战舰逃跑的
She's going to try to steal a ship to escape.

1154
01:36:31,770 --> 01:36:33,670
汉・索洛
Han Solo.

1155
01:36:44,510 --> 01:36:46,350
翻过山脊就是导流洞了
The flooding tunnel is over that ridge.

1156
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:47,730
我们从那边进去
We'll get in that way.

1157
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:49,580
你在基地里的工作是什么
What was your job when you were based here?

1158
01:36:49,610 --> 01:36:51,270
卫生设备
Sanitation.

1159
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:55,180
卫生设备
Sanitation?

1160
01:36:55,210 --> 01:36:57,160
那你怎么知道怎么关掉保护罩
And how do you know how to disable the shields?

1161
01:36:57,180 --> 01:37:00,000
我不知道 我是来这救蕾伊的
I don't. I'm just here to get Rey.

1162
01:37:00,030 --> 01:37:03,920
人们指望着我们 银河系也指望着我们呢
People are counting on us. The galaxy is counting on us.

1163
01:37:03,950 --> 01:37:06,080
索洛 我们会找到方法的
Solo, we'll figure it out.

1164
01:37:06,100 --> 01:37:07,570
我们可以使用原力
We'll use the force.

1165
01:37:07,570 --> 01:37:09,980
原力不是这样用的
That's not how the Force works.

1166
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,290
我好冷
I'm cold.

1167
01:37:11,310 --> 01:37:13,600
是吗 你还冷吗
Oh, really? You're cold?

1168
01:37:13,630 --> 01:37:14,990
走吧
Come on.

1169
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:23,970
报告
Report.

1170
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,890
武器还有十五分钟装载成功 长官
Weapon charged in 15 minutes, sir.

1171
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:35,010
我们在这时间越长 运气就越差
The longer we're here, the less luck we're going to have.

1172
01:37:35,030 --> 01:37:38,230
- 保护罩 - 我有个想法
- The shields. - I have an idea about that.

1173
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:47,950
- 还记得我吗 - FN-2187
- Do you remember me? - FN-2187

1174
01:37:47,970 --> 01:37:50,940
不再是了 我叫芬恩 现在由我做主
Not any more. The name's Finn and I'm in charge.

1175
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:53,020
现在由我做主了 法斯玛 由我做主
I'm in charge now, Phasma. I'm in charge.

1176
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:55,080
- 拿下他 拿下他 - 好
- Bring it down. Bring it down. - Okay.

1177
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:56,790
跟我来
Follow me.

1178
01:38:54,170 --> 01:38:55,370
你想要我把你头上那个
You want me to blast that

1179
01:38:55,370 --> 01:38:57,300
铁桶打下来吗 关掉保护罩
bucket off your head? Lower the shields.

1180
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:59,460
你正在犯下一个滔天大错
You're making a big mistake.

1181
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:00,830
照做
Do it.

1182
01:39:05,790 --> 01:39:06,800
索洛 如果这事有效
Solo, if this works,

1183
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:09,310
我们就没有多少时间去找蕾伊了
we're not going to have a lot of time to find Rey.

1184
01:39:09,330 --> 01:39:11,070
别担心 孩子
Don't worry, kid.

1185
01:39:11,530 --> 01:39:13,910
没找到她我们是不会离开这里的
We won't leave here without her.

1186
01:39:14,650 --> 01:39:17,570
你不会那么蠢的相信这事会这么容易吧
You can't be so stupid just to think this will be easy.

1187
01:39:17,570 --> 01:39:20,330
我的部队马上就会到这片区域来杀掉你们
My troops will storm this block and kill you all.

1188
01:39:20,350 --> 01:39:22,700
我不同意 我们怎么处理她
I disagree. What do we do with her?

1189
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:24,590
这里有垃圾倾倒槽吗
Is there a gabage chute?

1190
01:39:25,070 --> 01:39:27,080
垃圾压缩机呢
Trash compactor?

1191
01:39:27,350 --> 01:39:28,510
有的
There is.

1192
01:39:28,540 --> 01:39:30,390
将军 保护罩失效了
General, their shields are down.

1193
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:31,990
感谢造物主
Thank the maker!

1194
01:39:32,010 --> 01:39:33,960
汉做到了 派他们进去
Han did it! Send them in.

1195
01:39:33,980 --> 01:39:35,980
让波全权负责进攻
Give Poe full authorization for attack.

1196
01:39:35,980 --> 01:39:38,250
黑队组长 速度降到亚光速
Black leader, go to sublight speed formation.

1197
01:39:38,270 --> 01:39:39,390
收到 基地
Roger, base.

1198
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:41,890
红队 蓝队 听我指令
Red squad, Blue squad, take my lead.

1199
01:39:42,030 --> 01:39:43,880
将速度降到光速以下
Dropping out of lightspeed.

1200
01:39:57,170 --> 01:39:58,650
快到射程内了
Almost in range!

1201
01:39:58,650 --> 01:40:01,580
尽全力击中致命点
Hit the target dead center as many runs as we can get.

1202
01:40:01,610 --> 01:40:03,340
接近目标
Approaching target.

1203
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:09,260
敌机来袭
Fighters incoming!

1204
01:40:12,370 --> 01:40:13,460
开启保护罩
Shields up! Shields up!

1205
01:40:13,490 --> 01:40:15,170
派出所有舰队
Dispatch all squadrons.

1206
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:16,770
好的 将军
Yes, General.

1207
01:40:17,230 --> 01:40:19,120
好了 把它点燃吧
Alright, let's light it up!

1208
01:40:27,860 --> 01:40:29,210
直接命中
Ha! Direct hit!

1209
01:40:29,230 --> 01:40:30,330
但没有损坏
But no damage.

1210
01:40:30,350 --> 01:40:31,870
我们得持续攻击
Yeah, we got to keep hitting it.

1211
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:33,180
又一轮轰炸要来了
Another bombing run.

1212
01:40:33,180 --> 01:40:34,550
记住 太阳消失时
Remember, when the sun is gone,

1213
01:40:34,550 --> 01:40:36,100
他们的武器就装载成功要发射了
their weapon will be ready to fire.

1214
01:40:36,100 --> 01:40:39,060
但只要还有一丝光线 我们就有机会
But as long as there is light, we got a chance.

1215
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:42,740
- 波主人 敌机 - 伙计们 有很多客人来了
- Master Poe, enemy fighters! - Guys, we got a lot of company!

1216
01:40:59,980 --> 01:41:02,100
我们要利用机会把防爆门炸了
We'll use the charges to blow that blast door.

1217
01:41:02,130 --> 01:41:04,810
我去吸引火力 但我需要你的掩护
I'm going in and draw fire but I'm going to need you to cover.

1218
01:41:04,830 --> 01:41:06,190
你确定你要这么做吗
You sure you are up for this?

1219
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:07,280
当然不确定
Hell, no.

1220
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:10,200
我进去找蕾伊 部队肯定会跟在我们后面
I'll go in and try to find Rey. The troopers will be on our tail.

1221
01:41:10,220 --> 01:41:12,150
我们必须做好准备
We have to be ready for that.

1222
01:41:12,150 --> 01:41:14,140
那边还有入口隧道可以通往...
Oh, there's an access tunnel that leads...

1223
01:41:14,140 --> 01:41:16,800
你这是干什么 你这样干嘛
Why're you do that? Hm. Why're you doing this?

1224
01:41:16,820 --> 01:41:18,660
我在做计划呢
I'm trying to come up with a plan.

1225
01:41:33,530 --> 01:41:34,750
不
No!

1226
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:36,350
你还好吧
Are you alright?

1227
01:41:36,370 --> 01:41:38,190
- 还好 - 那就好
- Yeah. - Good.

1228
01:41:38,220 --> 01:41:39,840
你怎么样了 他伤到你了吗
What happened to you? Did he hurt you?

1229
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:43,070
- 芬恩 你来这干什么 - 我们是来救你的
- Finn, what are you doing here? - We came to get you.

1230
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:45,980
他说什么
What did he say?

1231
01:41:46,010 --> 01:41:47,830
他说这都是你的主意
He says it was your idea.

1232
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:53,040
谢谢
Thank you.

1233
01:41:56,100 --> 01:41:57,880
你是怎么跑出来的
How did you get away?

1234
01:41:57,900 --> 01:42:01,050
我没法解释 你也不会相信的
I can't explain it. And you wouldn't believe it.

1235
01:42:01,090 --> 01:42:03,790
现在要跑了 等会再抱吧
Escape now, hug later

1236
01:42:18,620 --> 01:42:20,170
我后面跟了一架敌机
I got one behind me.

1237
01:42:20,190 --> 01:42:22,200
- 看到了吗 - 看到了 我就过去
- You see it? - Yeah. I'm on it.

1238
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:33,080
小心地面火力进攻
Watch out for ground fire.

1239
01:42:37,130 --> 01:42:40,580
他们有麻烦了 我们不能走
They're in trouble. We can't leave.

1240
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:45,310
我的朋友带着一整包炸弹呢
My friend's got a bag full of explosives.

1241
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:47,010
用了吧
Let's use them.

1242
01:42:47,020 --> 01:42:48,690
将军 你看到了吗
General, are you seeing this?

1243
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:51,950
又有两架X战机被击落了 我们舰队一半战舰都被摧毁了
Two more X-wing's down. That's half our fleet destroyed.

1244
01:42:51,980 --> 01:42:55,040
他们的武器十分钟内就要装载成功了
And their weapon will be fully charged in 10 minutes.

1245
01:42:55,070 --> 01:42:57,980
只有奇迹发生才能救我们了
It would take a miracle to save us now.

1246
01:43:24,660 --> 01:43:26,640
那姑娘有一套啊
That girl knows her stuff.

1247
01:43:35,970 --> 01:43:39,120
隔一根柱子设置一个炸弹
Let's set the charges against every other column.

1248
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:41,980
你说对了 这确实是个更好的主意
You're right. That's a better idea.

1249
01:43:41,990 --> 01:43:44,090
你负责上面 我负责下面
You take the top. I'll go down below.

1250
01:43:44,110 --> 01:43:45,770
引爆装置
Detonator.

1251
01:43:45,790 --> 01:43:47,750
之后在这里碰头
We'll meet back here.

1252
01:44:33,090 --> 01:44:34,780
去找他们
Find them.

1253
01:45:35,580 --> 01:45:37,040
本
Ben!

1254
01:45:49,340 --> 01:45:51,080
汉・索洛
Han Solo.

1255
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:54,280
我等这一天已经很久了
I've been waiting for this day for a long time.

1256
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:17,170
摘下那个面具 你并不需要它
Take off that mask. You don't need it.

1257
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:19,570
如果我摘下面具 你觉得你会看到什么
What do you think you'll see if I do?

1258
01:46:19,590 --> 01:46:22,230
我儿子的脸
The face of my son.

1259
01:46:43,250 --> 01:46:46,140
你儿子已经死了
Your son is gone.

1260
01:46:47,010 --> 01:46:49,870
他跟他的父亲一样虚弱又愚蠢
He was weak and foolish like his father,

1261
01:46:49,890 --> 01:46:51,710
所以我毁了他
so I destroyed him.

1262
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:56,220
这就是斯诺克想要你相信的
That's what Snoke wants you to believe,

1263
01:46:56,850 --> 01:46:58,840
但这不是真的

1264
01:47:00,130 --> 01:47:02,310
我的儿子还活着
My son is alive.

1265

No.

1266

最高领袖是明智的
The Supreme Leader is wise.

1267
01:47:05,780 --> 01:47:08,680
斯诺克只是在利用你的力量
Snoke is using you for your power.

1268
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:12,050
等他得到想要的东西 他就会杀了你
When he gets what he wants, he'll crush you.

1269
01:47:16,130 --> 01:47:18,060
你知道的
You know it's true.

1270
01:47:23,310 --> 01:47:24,540
太晚了
It's too late.

1271
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:28,650
不 并不晚 跟我离开这里 跟我回家
No, it's not. Leave here with me. Come home.

1272
01:47:29,510 --> 01:47:31,350
我们很想你
We miss you.

1273
01:47:39,680 --> 01:47:41,870
我快被撕裂了
I'm being torn apart.

1274
01:47:44,470 --> 01:47:46,800
我想摆脱这种痛苦
I want to be free of this pain.

1275
01:47:52,250 --> 01:47:53,740
我知道我必须要做什么 但我不知道
I know what I have to do but I don't know

1276
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:55,880
我是否有力量做到
if I have the strength to do it.

1277
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:00,920
你会帮我吗
Will you help me?

1278
01:48:00,950 --> 01:48:03,320
会 不论何事
Yes. Anything.

1283
01:50:27,090 --> 01:50:28,720
但还在运作中
but it's still functional.

1284
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:32,520
司令 他们的武器还有两分钟就要开火了
Admiral, their weapon will fire in two minutes.

1285
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:44,420
