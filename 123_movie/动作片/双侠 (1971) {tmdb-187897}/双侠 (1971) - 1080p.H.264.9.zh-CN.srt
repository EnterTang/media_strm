1
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,269
<i>There was me.</i>

2
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:45,480
<i>That is, Alex,
and my three droogs.</i>

3
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,359
<i>That is, Pete, Georgie and Dim.</i>

4
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,445
<i>And we sat in the
Korova Milk Bar...</i>

5
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,363
<i>...trying to make up
our rassoodocks...</i>

6
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:55,866
<i>...what to do with the evening.</i>

7
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,662
<i>The Korova Milk Bar sold milk plus.</i>

8
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:04,541
<i>Milk plus vellocet or
synthemesc or drencrom.</i> ..

9
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,752
<i>...which is what we were drinking.</i>

10
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:08,712
<i>This would sharpen you up...</i>

11
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,841
<i>...and make you ready for a bit
of the old ultra-violence.</i>

12
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,464
<i>One thing I could never stand...</i>

13
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,175
<i>...was to see a filthy,
dirty old drunkie...</i>

14
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:58,095
<i>...howling away at the
filthy songs of his fathers...</i>

15
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,681
...and <i>going</i> "blerp blerp"
<i>in</i> between...

16
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:05,143
...as <i>it might be</i> a <i>filthy, old
orchestra in his stinking, rotten guts.</i>

17
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:09,022
<i>I could never stand to see anyone
like that, whatever his age might be.</i>

18
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:12,401
<i>But more especially when he
was real old, like this one was.</i>

19
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:24,037
Can you spare some cutter,
me brothers?

20
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,335
Go on! Do me in,
you bastard cowards!

21
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,379
I don't want to live anyway.

22
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,382
Not in a stinking world like this.

23
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,388
And what's so stinking about it?

24
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:45,851
It's a stinking world because
there's no law and order anymore!

25
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,271
It's a stinking world because it lets
the young get onto the old...

26
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,523
...like you done!

27
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:56,611
It's no world
for an old man any longer.

28
00:03:57,154 --> 00:04:00,574
What kind of a world is it at all?

29
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,743
Men on the moon...

30
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,495
...and men spinning around the earth.

31
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,998
And there's not no
attention paid...

32
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:12,461
...to earthly
law and order no more.

33
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:52,042
- Right. Get her clothes.
- No!

34
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:57,255
<i>It was around by the derelict casino
that we came across Billy-boy...</i>

35
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,549
<i>...and his four droogs.</i>

36
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,344
<i>They were about to perform
a little of the old...</i>

37
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:06,515
<i>...in-out, in-out on a weepy
young devotchka they had there.</i>

38
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,738
No!

39
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,939
Ho,ho,ho!

40
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,649
Well, if it isn't...

41
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,526
...fat, stinking...

42
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:04,030
...Billy goat Billy-boy in poison.

43
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,491
How are thou...

44
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:12,122
...thou globby bottle of cheap,
stinking chip-oil?

45
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,916
Come and get one in the yarbles...

46
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,085
...if you have any yarbles...

47
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:20,255
...you eunuch jelly, thou.

48
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,343
Let's get them, boys!

49
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,736
The police!

50
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,030
Come on. Let's go!

51
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:52,555
<i>The Durango 95 purred away
real horrorshow.</i>

52
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:57,060
<i>A nice warm vibratey feeling
all through your guttiwuts.</i>

53
00:07:57,268 --> 00:08:00,522
<i>Soon it was trees and dark,
my brothers...</i>

54
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,316
<i>...with real country dark.</i>

55
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:43,314
<i>We fillied around for a while with other
travelers of the night...</i>

56
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,900
<i>...playing Hogs of the Road.</i>

57
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,111
<i>Then we headed west.</i>

58
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:52,073
<i>What we were after now
was the old surprise visit.</i>

59
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,533
<i>That was a real kick...</i>

60
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:58,288
<i>...and good for laughs and
lashings of the old ultra-violent.</i>

61
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,797
Who on earth could that be?

62
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,349
I'll go and see.

63
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,861
Yes, who is it?

64
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,116
Excuse me, missis, can you please help?
There's been a terrible accident!

65
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,538
My friend's in the road bleeding to death!
Can I please use your telephone?

66
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,999
Sorry, we don't have a telephone.
You'll have to go somewhere else.

67
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,919
But, missis, it's a matter
of life and death!

68
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,504
Who is it, dear?

69
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,298
There's a young man.
He says there's been an accident.

70
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:35,218
He wants to use the telephone.

71
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,638
Well, I suppose you better let him in.

72
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,558
Well, wait a minute, will you?

73
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,980
I'm sorry, but we don't usually
let strangers in in the middle--

74
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,994
What do you want from me?

75
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,458
Right, Pete, check the rest
of the house. Dim.

76
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,707
Viddy well, little brother.

77
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,583
Viddy well.

78
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:36,774
<i>We were all feeling a bit
shagged and fagged and fashed...</i>

79
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:41,696
<i>...it having been an evening of some small
energy expenditure, O my brothers.</i>

80
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,239
<i>So we got rid of the auto...</i>

81
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:46,868
<i>...and stopped off at the Korova
for a nightcap.</i>

82
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,584
Hello, Lucy.

83
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,462
Had a busy night?

84
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,591
We've been working hard too.

85
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,762
Pardon me, Luce.

86
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:17,023
<i>There was some sophistos from
the TV studios around the corner...</i>

87
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,442
<i>...laughing and govoreeting.</i>

88
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,277
<i>The devotchka smeched away...</i>

89
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:25,031
<i>...not caring about
the wicked world one bit.</i>

90
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,118
<i>Then the disk on the stereo
twanged off and out.</i>

91
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:32,663
<i>And in the short silence
before the next one came on...</i>

92
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,042
<i>...she suddenly came
with a burst of singing.</i>

93
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,298
<i>And it was, like, for a moment,
O my brothers...</i>

94
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:45,760
<i>...some great bird
had flown into the milk bar.</i>

95
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,305
<i>And I felt all the malenky
little hairs on my plott...</i>

96
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,391
<i>...standing endwise.</i>

97
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:55,770
<i>And the shivers crawling up
like slow, malenky lizards...</i>

98
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,605
<i>...and then down again.</i>

99
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,525
<i>Because I knew what she sang.</i>

100
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:04,195
<i>It was a bit from
the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van.</i>

101
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,164
What did you do that for?

102
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,500
For being a bastard
with no manners.

103
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:22,505
Without a dook of an idea about how to
comport yourself public-wise, O my brother.

104
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,552
I don't like you should
do what you done.

105
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:31,472
And I'm not your brother no more
and wouldn't wanna be.

106
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,310
Watch that.

107
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,688
Do watch that, O Dim...

108
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:42,525
...if to continue to be on live
thou dost wish.

109
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,695
Yarbles!

110
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,656
Great, bouncy yarblockos to you!

111
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:52,785
I'll meet you with chain
or nozh or britva anytime.

112
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,663
I'm not having you aiming
tolchocks at me reasonless.

113
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:59,000
It stands to reason,
I won't have it.

114
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:07,091
A nozh scrap anytime you say.

115
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,733
Doobidoob.

116
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,945
A bit tired maybe.

117
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,908
Best not to say more.

118
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,745
Bedways is rightways now.

119
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,415
So best we go homeways
and get a bit of spatchka.

120
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,334
Right, right?

121
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,085
- Right, right.
- Right, right.

122
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,046
Right, right.

123
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,057
<i>Where I lived was with
my dada and mum...</i>

124
00:16:56,265 --> 00:17:00,603
...in <i>municipal flat block
18-A Linear North.</i>

125
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,566
<i>It had been a wonderful evening.</i>

126
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,361
<i>And what I needed now
to give it the perfect ending...</i>

127
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,531
<i>...was a bit
of the old Ludwig van.</i>

128
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:26,957
<i>Oh, bliss!</i>

129
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,627
<i>Bliss and heaven!</i>

130
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:34,674
<i>Oh, it was gorgeousness and
gorgeosity made flesh.</i>

131
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:39,553
<i>It was like a bird
of rarest spun, heaven metal.</i>

132
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:43,265
<i>Or like silvery wine
flowing in a spaceship...</i>

133
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:46,268
<i>...gravity all nonsense now.</i>

134
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:48,270
<i>As I slooshied...</i>

135
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:51,524
<i>...I knew such lovely pictures.</i>

136
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:13,838
Alex. Alex!

137
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:16,841
Alex!

138
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,677
Alex!

139
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,303
What do you want?

140
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,139
It's past 8, Alex.

141
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,434
You don't want to be
late for school, son.

142
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,563
Bit of a pain in the gulliver, Mum.

143
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,315
Leave us be,
and I'll try and sleep it off.

144
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:36,318
And then I'll be as right
as dodgers for this after.

145
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,406
But you've not been
to school all week, son.

146
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:41,782
Got to rest, Mum.

147
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,118
Got to get fit.

148
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:48,122
Otherwise I'm liable
to miss a lot more school.

149
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,666
I'll put your breakfast
in the oven.

150
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,919
I've got to be off meself now.

151
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,213
All right, Mum.

152
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,716
Have a nice day at the factory.

153
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:06,182
He's not feeling too good
again this morning, Dad.

154
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,267
Yes. Yes, I heard.

155
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:10,227
You know what time he got in?

156
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:13,481
No, I don't.
I'd taken me sleepers.

157
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,651
I wonder...

158
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:22,156
...where exactly is it
he goes to work of evenings.

159
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:25,743
Well, like he says...

160
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,287
...it's mostly odd things he does.

161
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:29,705
Helping-like...

162
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:32,541
...here and there as it might be.

163
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,252
Hi, hi, hi, Mr. Deltoid.

164
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,462
Funny surprise, seeing you here.

165
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,172
Alex-boy.

166
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,550
Awake at last, yes?

167
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:26,262
I met your mother
on the way to work, yes?

168
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,514
She gave me the key.

169
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,561
She said something about
a pain somewhere.

170
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,730
Hence not at school, yes?

171
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,234
A rather intolerable pain
in the head, brother sir.

172
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,611
It should be clear
by this afterlunch.

173
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,115
Or certainly by this evening, yes.

174
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:49,535
The evening's the great time,
isn't it, Alex-boy?

175
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:53,372
- Cup of the old chai, sir?
- No time, no time, yes.

176
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:55,165
Sit, sit, sit!

177
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,461
To what do I owe
this extreme pleasure, sir?

178
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,463
Anything wrong, sir?

179
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:05,509
Wrong? Why should you
think of anything being wrong?

180
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,137
Have you been doing
something you shouldn't, yes?

181
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:09,680
Just a manner of speech, sir.

182
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,975
Yes, well, it's just a manner
of speech from your...

183
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:16,478
...post-corrective advisor to you,
that you watch out, little Alex.

184
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:20,316
Because next time it's not going to
be the corrective school anymore.

185
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:24,820
Next time it's going to be the Barley place,
and all my work ruined.

186
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:26,864
If you've no respect for yourself...

187
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:30,200
...you at least might have some
for me, who sweated over you.

188
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:34,580
A big, black mark, I tell you,
for every one we don't reclaim.

189
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:38,042
A confession of failure
for every one of you...

190
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,170
...who ends up in the stripy hole.

191
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,297
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't.

192
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,133
The millicents have nothing
on me, brother.

193
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,676
Sir, I mean.

194
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,512
Cut out this clever talk
about millicents.

195
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,973
Just because the police
haven't picked you up...

196
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:56,393
...doesn't mean that you've not
been up to some nastiness.

197
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,687
There was a bit
of nastiness last night, yes?

198
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,774
Some very extreme nastiness, yes?

199
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:06,236
A few of a certain Billy-boy's
friends were ambulanced off late, yes.

200
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,613
Your name was mentioned.

201
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,366
The words got through to me
by the usual channels.

202
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,452
Certain friends of yours
were named also.

203
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:16,872
Oh, nobody can prove anything
about anybody, as usual.

204
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,749
I'm warning you, little Alex...

205
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,210
...being a good friend
to you as always...

206
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:24,213
...the one man in this
sore and sick community...

207
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,174
...who wants to save you
from yourself!

208
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,278
What gets into you all?

209
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,865
We've been studying the problem
for damn well near a century.

210
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,243
But we get no farther
with our studies.

211
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,912
You got a good home here.
Good, loving parents.

212
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:59,373
You've got not too bad of a brain.

213
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,751
Is it some devil
that crawls inside of you?

214
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,878
Nobody's got anything on me, brother sir.

215
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:07,923
I been out of the millicents'
rockers for a long time.

216
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:12,678
That's just what worries me.
A bit too long to be safe.

217
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,763
You're about due, by my reckoning.

218
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,265
That's why I'm warning you...

219
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:20,060
...to keep your handsome
young proboscis out of the dirt.

220
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:21,603
Do I make myself clear?

221
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:23,313
As an unmuddied lake, sir.

222
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:26,900
As clear as an azure sky
of deepest summer.

223
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,445
You can rely on me, sir.

224
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,012
Excuse me, brother.

225
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:40,849
I ordered this two weeks ago.
Can you see if it's arrived yet, please?

226
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:43,519
Just a minute.

227
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,547
Pardon me, ladies.

228
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,724
Enjoying that, are you, my darling?

229
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,730
A bit cold and pointless,
isn't it, my lovely?

230
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,988
What's happened to yours,
my little sister?

231
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,575
Who you getting, bratty?

232
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:44,079
Goggly Gogol? Johnny Zhivago?
The Heaven 17?

233
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:52,254
What you got back home, little sister,
to play your fuzzy warbles on?

234
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:56,758
I bet you've got little, say,
pitiful, portable picnic players.

235
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:59,178
Come with Uncle
and hear all proper.

236
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:02,431
Hear angel trumpets
and devil trombones.

237
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,725
You are invited.

238
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:29,393
- Hi, hi, hi, there.
- Well, hello.

239
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,312
He are here!
He have arrived!

240
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,106
Hooray!

241
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,567
Welly, welly, welly,
welly, welly, welly, well.

242
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:41,280
To what do I owe
the extreme pleasure...

243
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,032
...of this surprising visit?

244
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,039
We got worried.

245
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:58,797
There we were, waiting and drinking
away at the old knifey moloko...

246
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,591
...and you had not turned up.

247
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,219
And we thought
you might have been, like...

248
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:06,847
...offended by something
or other.

249
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,433
So around we come to your abode.

250
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,065
Appy polly loggies.

251
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:20,527
I had something of a pain
in the gulliver, so I had to sleep.

252
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:23,572
I was not awakened
when I gave orders for wakening.

253
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,241
Sorry about the pain.

254
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,494
Using the gulliver
too much-like, maybe.

255
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:36,084
Giving orders and
discipline and such, perhaps.

256
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:38,879
You sure the pain is gone?

257
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:42,466
You sure you'd not
be happier back in bed?

258
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:08,200
Let's get things nice
and sparkling clear.

259
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,122
This sarcasm,
if I may call it such...

260
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:17,125
...does not become you,
O my little brothers.

261
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,252
As I am your droog and leader...

262
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,130
...I'm entitled to know
what goes on, eh?

263
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,840
Yeah.

264
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,300
Now then, Dim.

265
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:29,638
What does that great big
horsey gape of a grin portend?

266
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,310
All right, no more
picking on Dim, brother.

267
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:38,063
That's part of the new way.

268
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,155
New Way?

269
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,741
What's this about a new way?

270
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:55,956
There's been some very large talk
behind my sleeping back, and no error.

271
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:00,168
Well, if you must have it, have it, then.

272
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,672
We go around shop crasting
and the like...

273
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,341
...coming out with a pitiful
rookerfull of money each.

274
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:07,592
Pitiful rookerfull.

275
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,095
And there's Will the English
in the coffee mesto...

276
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:13,223
...saying he can fence anything
any malchick tries to crast.

277
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:16,101
- Yeah. Shiny stuff.
- The shiny stuff. The Ice!

278
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:19,187
The big, big money's available,
is what Will the English says.

279
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,189
Big, big money.

280
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:25,819
And what will you do
with the big, big, big money?

281
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,029
Have you not everything you need?

282
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:31,199
If you need a motorcar,
you pluck it from the trees.

283
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:34,411
If you need pretty polly, you take it.

284
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:38,039
Brother, you think and talk
sometimes like a little child.

285
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,833
A little child, yeah.

286
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,711
Tonight we pull a man-size crast.

287
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:44,254
Tonight's a man-size crast.

288
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,965
- Good! Real horrorshow!
- Yeah.

289
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:49,551
Initiative comes to thems that wait.

290
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:53,221
I've taught you much,
my little droogies.

291
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:58,059
Now tell me what you had in mind,
Georgie-boy.

292
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:04,566
The old moloko plus first.
Would you not say?

293
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:08,278
- Something to sharpen us up.
- Some of the moloko plus.

294
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:10,280
But you especially.
We have the start.

295
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:13,074
You gotta take it first
because we've got a start on you.

296
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,453
Yeah, moloko plus, eh? Yeah.

297
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,337
<i>As we walked along
the flatblock marina...</i>

298
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:29,799
<i>...I was calm on the outside,
but thinking all the time.</i>

299
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,636
<i>So now it was to be
Georgie the General...</i>

300
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,347
<i>...saying what we should do
and what not to do.</i>

301
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:39,476
<i>And Dim as his mindless,
grinning bulldog.</i>

302
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:43,396
<i>But suddenly I viddied that
thinking was for the gloopy ones...</i>

303
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,690
<i>...and that the oomny ones
used, like...</i>

304
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:48,818
<i>"inspiration and what Bog sends.</i>

305
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:53,073
<i>For now it was lovely music
that came to my aid.</i>

306
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:56,409
<i>There was a window open
with a stereo on...</i>

307
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,996
<i>...and I viddied right at once
what to do.</i>

308
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,107
<i>I had not cut into any
of Dim's main cables.</i>

309
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:11,651
<i>And so with the help
of a clean tashtook...</i>

310
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,195
<i>...the red, red kroovy soon stopped.</i>

311
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:18,158
<i>And it did not take long to
quieten the two wounded soldiers...</i>

312
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:21,077
<i>...down in the snug
of the Duke of New York.</i>

313
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:25,540
<i>Now they knew who was
master and leader.</i>

314
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:28,001
<i>Sheep, thought I.</i>

315
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,420
<i>But a real leader knows
always when, like...</i>

316
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:33,882
<i>...to give and show generous
to his unders.</i>

317
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,383
Well...

318
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:38,762
Now we're back to where we were.

319
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,263
Yes?

320
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,391
Just like before, and all forgotten?

321
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,310
Right, right, right?

322
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,188
Right.

323
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,442
Right.

324
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,030
Right.

325
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,743
Well, Georgie-boy...

326
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:06,039
...this idea of yours for tonight.
Tell us all about it, then.

327
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:10,710
Not tonight. Not this nochy.

328
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,880
Come, come, come, Georgie-boy.

329
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,801
You're a big, strong chelloveck,
like us all.

330
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:21,304
We're not little children,
are we, Georgie-boy?

331
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:25,642
What, then, didst thou
in thy mind have?

332
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,401
<i>It's this health farm.</i>

333
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,529
<i>A bit out of the town.</i>

334
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,989
<i>Isolated.</i>

335
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:45,745
<i>It's owned by this, like, very rich ptitsa
who lives there with her cats.</i>

336
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,123
<i>The place is shut down for a week...</i>

337
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,750
<i>...and she's completely on her own.</i>

338
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,797
<i>And it's full up with, like,
gold and silver...</i>

339
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,966
<i>...and, like, jewels.</i>

340
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,636
<i>Tell me more, Georgie-boy.</i>

341
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,471
<i>Tell me more.</i>

342
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:11,229
Oh, shit!

343
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,248
Who's there?

344
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:32,834
Excuse me, missis, can you please help?

345
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:34,627
There's been a terrible accident!

346
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:37,756
Can I please use your telephone
for an ambulance?

347
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,759
I'm frightfully sorry.

348
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:45,263
There's a telephone in the public house
about a mile down the road.

349
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,348
I suggest you use that.

350
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,601
But, missis, this is an emergency!

351
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,644
It's a matter of life and death!

352
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:55,690
Me friend's lying in the middle
of the road, bleeding to death!

353
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,026
I'm very sorry...

354
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:02,280
...but I never open the door
to strangers after dark.

355
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:05,742
Very well, madam.

356
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:08,369
You can't be blamed
for being suspicious...

357
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:12,457
...with so many scoundrels
and rogues of the night about.

358
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:15,293
I'll try and get help
at the pub, then.

359
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:17,921
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.

360
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,380
Thank you very much.

361
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:21,257
Good night.

362
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,671
Dim, bend down.

363
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:04,592
I'm gonna get in that window
and open the front door.

364
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,039
Hello. Radlett Police Station?

365
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:38,167
Good evening. It's Miss Weathers
at Woodmere Health Farm.

366
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,837
<i>- Good evening, ma'am.
- Hello.</i>

367
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:45,133
Look, I'm sorry to bother you, but
something rather odd has just happened.

368
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,219
It's probably nothing at all,
but you never know.

369
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:52,473
Well, a young man rang the bell,
asking to use the telephone.

370
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,018
He said there'd been
some kind of accident.

371
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,729
The thing that caught my
attention was what he said.

372
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:01,816
The words he used sounded like those
quoted in the papers this morning...

373
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:05,528
...in connection with the writer and his wife
who were assaulted last night.

374
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:08,781
<i>- When did this take place, ma 'am?
- Just</i> a <i>few minutes ago.</i>

375
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,701
<i>I think we'd better send
a patrol car around to see you.</i>

376
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:13,703
Well, if you think that's necessary.

377
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,788
But I'm quite sure
he's gone away now.

378
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:19,584
<i>- He'll be there in</i> a <i>few minutes.</i>
- Oh, <i>all right, fine.</i>

379
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:24,297
- My pleasure, ma'am.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.

380
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,260
Hi, hi, hi there.

381
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:30,845
At last we meet.

382
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:35,725
Our brief govorett through the letter-hole
was not, shall we say, satisfactory.

383
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:38,311
- Yes?
- Who are you?

384
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:41,522
How the hell did you get in here?

385
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:46,736
What the bloody hell
do you think you're doing?

386
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,575
Naughty, naughty, naughty!

387
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:55,453
You filthy old soomaka.

388
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:59,290
Now listen here, you little bastard!

389
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:02,919
Just turn round and walk out
of here the same way as you came in.

390
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:10,343
Leave that alone! Don't touch it!
It's a very important work of art.

391
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,564
Well, what the bloody hell do you want?

392
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:27,902
Well, to be perfectly honest, madam...

393
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:31,406
...I'm taking part in an
international students' contest...

394
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:35,493
...to see who can get the most
points for selling magazines.

395
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:37,829
Cut the shit, sonny...

396
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:42,583
...and get out of here before you get
yourself into some very serious trouble.

397
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:45,420
I told you to leave that alone!
Now get out of here...

398
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:48,089
...before I throw you out!

399
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:51,426
Wretched, slummy bedbug!

400
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:55,596
I'll teach you to break
into real people's houses.

401
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:57,890
Fucking...

402
00:41:58,099 --> 00:41:59,100
...little...

403
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,185
...bastard!

404
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,841
- Let's go! The police are coming!
- One minoota, droogie.

405
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:23,351
You bastards! I'm blind!

406
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,645
I'm blind, you bastards!

407
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,647
I can't see!

408
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,622
It's no good sitting there in hope,
my little brothers.

409
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:49,210
I won't say a single solitary
slovo unless I have my lawyer here.

410
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:52,046
I know the law, you bastards.

411
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:01,639
Righty-right, Tom.

412
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:07,019
We'll have to show our friend Alex
here that we know the law too.

413
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,939
But that knowing the law
isn't everything.

414
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:27,415
Nasty out you've got there,
little Alex.

415
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,376
Shame, isn't it?

416
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:33,254
Spoils all your beauty.

417
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,966
Who gave you that, then?

418
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:40,094
How'd you do that, then?

419
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:47,226
- What's that for, you bastard?
- That is for your lady victim.

420
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:48,728
You ghastly...

421
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,730
...wretched scoundrel.

422
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,233
Get him off me!

423
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,278
You rotten little bastard!

424
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:06,913
Good evening, Mr. Deltoid.

425
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,789
Good evening, sergeant.

426
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:11,959
- They're in Room B, sir.
- Thank you very much.

427
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,170
- Sergeant--
- Sir.

428
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:17,131
- Good evening, Mr. Deltoid.
- Good evening, inspector.

429
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:20,301
- Would you like your tea now, sir?
- No, thank you, sergeant.

430
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:22,511
- May I have some paper towels?
- Yes, sir.

431
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:25,056
We're interrogating
the prisoner now.

432
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:28,851
- Perhaps you'd care to come inside.
- Thank you very much.

433
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,438
- Good evening, sergeant. And evening, all.
- Mr. Deltoid.

434
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:37,652
Dear, dear! This boy
does look a mess, doesn't he?

435
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,737
Just look at the state of him.

436
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:41,989
Loves young nightmare-like.

437
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,116
Violence makes violence.

438
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:46,327
He resisted his lawful arrestors.

439
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:51,165
This is the end of the line for me.

440
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:54,543
The end of the line, yes.

441
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:56,337
And what of me, brother sir?

442
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,297
Speak up for me.
For I'm not so bad.

443
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:00,508
I was led on by
the treachery of others.

444
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:03,552
Sings the roof off lovely,
he does that.

445
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:07,098
Where are my treacherous droogs?
Get them before they get away!

446
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,183
It was all their idea, brothers.

447
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:12,103
They forced me to do it.
I'm innocent!

448
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:21,570
You are now a murderer,
little Alex.

449
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:23,572
A murderer.

450
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:26,409
Not true, sir.

451
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,452
It was only a slight tolchok.

452
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:31,163
She were breathing, I swear it.

453
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,916
I've just come from the hospital.

454
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:36,377
Your victim has died.

455
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:39,880
You try to frighten me. Admit so, sir.

456
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,049
This is some new form of torture.

457
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:45,594
- Say it, brother sir.
- It'll be your own torture.

458
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:49,640
I hope to God
it'll torture you to madness.

459
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:54,603
If you'd care to give him a bash
in the chops, don't mind us.

460
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,605
We'll hold him down.

461
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:00,484
He must be a great
disappointment to you, sir.

462
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:33,601
<i>This is the real weepy and, like, tragic
part of the story beginning...</i>

463
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:36,103
<i>...O my brothers and only friends.</i>

464
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,814
<i>After a trial
with judges and a jury...</i>

465
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:43,319
<i>...and some very hard words spoken against
your friend and humble narrator...</i>

466
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:47,698
<i>...he was sentenced to 14 years
in Staja Number 84-F...</i>

467
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:51,452
<i>...among smelly perverts
and hardened prestoopniks.</i>

468
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:55,539
<i>The shock sending my dada beating
his bruised and krovvy rockers...</i>

469
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:58,125
<i>...against unfair Bog
in His Heaven.</i>

470
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:01,587
<i>And my mum boo-hoo-hooing
in her mother's grief...</i>

471
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:04,215
<i>...at her only child
and son of her bosom...</i>

472
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:07,093
<i>...like, letting everybody down
real horrorshow.</i>

473
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,303
Morning.
One up from Thames, mister.

474
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:11,013
One up from Thames, sir.

475
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:12,932
Right! Open up the cell!

476
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,475
Yes, sir.

477
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:33,202
Good morning. Here are
the prisoner's committal forms.

478
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:34,870
Thank you, mister.

479
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:39,208
- Name?
- Alexander DeLarge.

480
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:41,377
You are now in
H.M. Prison Parkmoor.

481
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:45,089
And from this moment, you will address
all prison officers as "sir."

482
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:46,257
Name?

483
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,801
Alexander DeLarge, sir.

484
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:51,595

485
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:54,098

486
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:57,268
Right.
Take the cuffs off him, mister.

487
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:11,031
You are now 655321.

488
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:14,535
And it is your duty
to memorize that number.

489
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,829
Thank you, mister. Well done.

490
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,831
- Thank you.
- Let the officer out.

491
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,124
Yes, sir.

492
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,379
All right, empty your pockets.

493
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:32,303
Are you able to see the white line
painted on the floor...

494
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,929
...directly behind you...

495
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:35,473
...655321?

496
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:39,435
- Yes, sir.
- Then your toes belong...

497
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,604
...on the other side of it!

498
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:50,279
- Yes, sir.
- Right.

499
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:52,072
Carry on.

500
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:57,870
Pick that up...

501
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:00,831
...and put it down properly.

502
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:13,594
One half-bar of chocolate.

503
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:18,599

on white, metal ring.

504
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:23,604
One packet of cigarettes.

00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:28,943
Two plastic ball pens.

506
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,278
One black, one red.

507
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:37,660
One pocket comb, black plastic.

508
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:39,703
One...

509
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:42,831
...address book,
imitation red leather.

510
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,551
One ten-penny piece.

511
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:57,638

00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:01,809
Timawrist, on a white, metal
expanding bracelet.

513
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:04,937
Anything else in your pockets?

514
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,481
- No, sir.
- Right.

515
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:10,818
Sign here for your valuable property.

516
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,787
The tobacco and chocolate
you brought in...

517
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:23,372
...you lose that...

518
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:25,666
...as you are now convicted.

519
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,670
Now over to the table
and get undressed.

520
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:36,427
Now, then...

521
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:38,554
...were you in police custody
this morning?

522
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:40,556
- No, sir.
- One jacket, blue pinstriped.

523
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,225

Yes, sir,

528
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:51,859
Brown hair, isn't it?

529
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,277
Fair hair, sir.

530
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:56,196

531
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:59,074
Do you wear eyeglasses

00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,242

534
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:05,623
Have you been receiving medical

00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:06,790

00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,209
One pair of boots, black leather.

537
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:12,046

538
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:15,132

00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:18,510
- No, sir.
- One pair of trousers, blue pinstriped.

540
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:21,472

00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:23,891

544
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:32,149
Are you now or have you ever been
a homosexual?

545
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:34,068
- No, sir.
- Right.

546
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,862
- The mothballs, mister.
- Mothballs, sir.

547
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,239
Now then, face the wall...

548
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:42,076
...bend over and touch your toes.

549
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:50,209
- Any venereal disease?

550
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:51,960

551
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,254
- Through there for the bath.
- One for a bath.

552
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,840
- One for a bath.
- One for a bath.

553
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,343
What's it going to be, eh?

554
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:03,097
Is it going to be in and out
of institutions like this...

555
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:05,391
...though more in than out
for most of you?

556
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:09,645
Or are you going to attend
to the divine word...

557
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:13,607
...and realize the punishments
that await unrepentant sinners...

558
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:15,984
...in the next world
as well as this?

559
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,278
A lot of idiots you are...

560
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:23,158
...selling your birthright
for a saucer of cold porridge.

561
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:26,203
The thrill of theft. Of violence.

562
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:29,164
The urge to live easy.

563
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:32,126
Well, I ask you what is it worth...

564
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:34,670
...when we have undeniable proof...

565
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:38,090
...yes, incontrovertible
evidence...

566
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:39,633
...that hell exists?

567
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,051
I know!

568
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:43,887
I know, my friends.

569
00:53:44,096 --> 00:53:46,223
I have been informed...

570
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:47,975
...in visions...

571
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:49,685
...that there is a place...

572
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:52,312
...darker than any prison...

573
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:56,650
...hotter than any flame
of human fire...

574
00:53:56,817 --> 00:53:58,235
...where souls...

575
00:53:58,444 --> 00:54:02,656
...of unrepentant criminal sinners
like yourselves--

576
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:06,160
Don't you laugh, damn you!

577
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,245
Don't you laugh.

578
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:11,498
I say, like yourselves...

579
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:13,250
...scream...

580
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:17,379
...in endless and
unendurable agony.

581
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:19,548
Their skin...

582
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:22,301
...rotting and peeling.

583
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,303
A fireball...

584
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,889
...spinning in their screaming guts!

585
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:30,517
I know. Oh, yes, I know!

586
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:35,522
I saw you, 920537. I saw you!

587
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:39,860
Quiet! All right, you lot!
We'll end by singing hymn 258...

588
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,403
...in the prisoner's hymnal.

589
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:44,865
And let's have a little reverence,
you bastards!

590
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:55,834
Come on, sing up, damn you! Louder!

591
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:09,765
Loudefl

592
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:13,310
<i>It had not been edifying.
Indeed not.</i>

593
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:17,439
<i>Being in this hellhole
and human zoo for two years now.</i>

594
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:20,818
<i>Being kicked and tolchoked
by brutal warders...</i>

595
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:24,071
<i>...and meeting leering criminals
and perverts...</i>

596
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,864
<i>...ready to dribble all over...</i>

597
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:28,992
<i>...a luscious young malchick
like your storyteller.</i>

598
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,083
<i>It was my rabbit...</i>

599
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:39,545
...to <i>help the prison charlie
with the Sunday service.</i>

600
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:42,840
<i>He was a bolshy,
great burly bastard.</i>

601
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:46,134
<i>But he was very fond of myself,
me being very young...</i>

602
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:49,763
<i>...and also now very interested
in the Big Book.</i>

603
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:01,650
Move along there!

604
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:05,404
Move along!

605
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:10,659
Move along there!
Move along!

606
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:14,788
<i>I read all about the scourging
and the crowning with thorns.</i>

607
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:16,874
<i>And I could viddy myself
helping</i> in...

608
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:21,086
...and <i>even taking charge of
the to/choking and the nailing in.</i>

609
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:24,631
<i>Being dressed in the height
of Roman fashion.</i>

610
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:39,104
<i>I didn't so much like
the latter part of the Book...</i>

611
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:41,481
<i>...which is more like
all preachy talking...</i>

612
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:43,942
<i>...than fighting
and the old in-out.</i>

613
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:47,279
<i>I like the parts where these old
yahoodies tolchok each other...</i>

614
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:49,740
<i>...and then drink their Hebrew vino...</i>

615

...and <i>getting onto the bed
with their wives' handmaidens.</i>

616
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,495
<i>That kept me going.</i>

617

00:57:32,491 --> 00:57:35,619
...because their minds
studieth robberies...

00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:42,542
If thou lose hope, being weary
in the days of distress...

622
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,045
...thy strength
shall be diminished.

623
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:47,005
Fine, my son. Fine, fine.

624
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:48,423
Father?

625
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:55,597
- I have tried, have I not?
- You have, my son.

626
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:58,183
- I've done my best, have I not?
Jndeed.

627
00:57:58,392 --> 00:58:01,853
I've never been guilty of any
institutional infraction, have I, Father?

628
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:06,400
You certainly have not, 655321.
You've been very helpful.

629
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:09,528
And you've shown
a genuine desire to reform.

630
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,071
Father...

631
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:15,242
...can I ask you
a question in private?

632
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,870
Certainly, my son. Certainly.

633
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:31,591
Is there something
troubling you, my son?

634
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,597
Don't be shy to speak up.

635
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:40,809
Remember...

636
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:43,061
...I know...

637
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:47,107
...of the urges that can
trouble young men...

638
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:48,900
...deprived...

639
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:51,111
...of the society of women.

640
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:53,822
Oh, Father.

641
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:56,324
It's nothing like that, Father.

642
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:03,623
It's about this new thing
they're all talking about, Father.

643
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:05,709
About this new treatment.

644
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:08,295
It gets you out of prison in no time at all.

645
00:59:08,462 --> 00:59:11,131
And makes sure you
never get back in again.

646
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:14,134
Where did you hear about this?

647
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:17,054
Who's been talking
about these things?

648
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:19,806
These things get around, Father.

649
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:22,309
Two warders talk, as it might be.

650
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:25,562
And somebody can't help
overhearing what they say.

651
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:29,524
Then somebody picks up a scrap
of newspaper in the workshops...

652
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:32,319
...and the newspaper
tells all about it.

653
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:38,825
How about putting me in
for this new treatment, Father?

654
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:41,745
I take it...

655
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:44,331
...you are referring...

656
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:46,792
...to the Ludovico Technique.

657
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,878
I don't know what it's called, Father.

658
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:52,005
I just know it
gets you out quickly...

659
00:59:52,214 --> 00:59:54,800
...and makes sure you
never get back in again.

660
00:59:55,467 --> 00:59:58,345
That is not proven, 655321.

661
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:02,724
In fact, it is only in the
experimental stage at this moment.

662
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:06,019
It is being used, isn't it, Father?

663
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:08,980
It has not been used
in this prison yet.

664
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:11,691
The governor has grave
doubts about it.

665
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:15,654
And I have heard that there are
very serious dangers involved.

666
01:00:17,656 --> 01:00:20,492
I don't care about the dangers, Father.

667
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:24,287
I just want to be good.

668
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:28,291
I want for the rest
of my life to be...

669
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,585
...one act of goodness.

670
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:32,337
The question is...

671
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,506
...whether or not this technique...

672
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:37,384
...really makes a man good.

673
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:40,554
Goodness comes from within.

674
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,888
Goodness...

675
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:43,515
...is chosen.

676
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:46,017
When a man cannot choose...

677
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:48,353
...he ceases to be a man.

678
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:52,065
I don't understand...

679
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:55,068
...about the whys and wherefores, Father.

680
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:59,239
I only know I want to be good.

681
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:03,243
Be patient, my son.

682
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,745
Put your trust in the Lord.

683
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:11,251
Instruct Thy son
and he shall refresh Thee...

684
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:14,379
...and shall give delight
to Thy soul.

685
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,256
Amen.

686
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,952
- Mister!
- All present and correct, sir!

687
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:47,204
Right!

688
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:50,832
All present and correct, sir!

689
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:47,973
Prisoners, halt!

690
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:50,141
Now pay attention!

691
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,644
I want you in two lines...

692
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:55,522
...up against that wall,
facing this way.

693
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,315
Go on, move!

694
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:58,817
Hurry UP!

695
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:00,360
Stop talking!

696
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:08,785
Prisoners ready
for inspection, sir!

697
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:25,927
How many to a cell?

698
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:28,054
Four in this block, sir.

699
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:31,182
Cram criminals together
and what do you get?

700
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:34,644
Concentrated criminality.
Crime in the midst of punishment.

701
01:03:34,853 --> 01:03:38,565
I agree, sir. What we need
are larger prisons, more money.

702
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:40,567
Not a chance, my dear fellow.

703
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:43,028
The government can't be
concerned any longer...

704
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:45,155
...with outmoded penalogical theories.

705
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:48,992
Soon we may be needing all our
prison space for political offenders.

706
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,787
Common criminals like these are best
dealt with on a purely curative basis.

707
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:55,790
Kill the criminal reflex,
that's all.

708
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:58,209
Full implementation
in a year's time.

709
01:03:58,418 --> 01:04:00,754
Punishment means nothing to them.
You can see that.

710
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,882
They enjoy their
so-called punishment.

711
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:08,136
- You're absolutely right, sir.
- Shut your bleeding hole!

712
01:04:08,762 --> 01:04:10,305
Who said that?

713
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:12,349
I did, sir.

714
01:04:18,605 --> 01:04:20,357
What crime did you commit?

715
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:22,692
The accidental killing
of a person, sir.

716
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:25,653
He brutally murdered a woman
in furtherance of theft.

717
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,489
Fourteen years, sir.

718
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:29,949
Excellent.

719
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:32,702
He's enterprising...

720
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:35,413
...aggressive, outgoing...

721
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:37,999
...young, bold...

722
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:39,751
...vicious.

723
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:42,712
<i>- He'll do.
- Well, fine.</i>

724
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:44,506
We could still look at C-block.

725
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:46,800
No, no, no. That's enough.
He's perfect.

726
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:48,760
I want his records sent to me.

727
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:50,303
This vicious young hoodlum...

728
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:52,555
...will be transformed
out of all recognition.

729
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,724
Thank you very much
for this chance, sir.

730
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:57,685
Let's hope you make
the most of it, my boy.

731
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:00,522
- Shall we go to my office?
- Thank you.

732
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:08,613
Come in.

733
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:14,494
- Sir! 655321. Sir!
- Very good, chief.

734
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:16,413
Forward to the line.
Toes behind it.

735
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:19,165
Full name and number
to the governor.

736
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:23,211
Alexander DeLarge, sir.
655321, sir.

737
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:29,008
I don't suppose you know
who that was this morning, do you?

738
01:05:29,217 --> 01:05:32,887
That was no less a personage
than the minister of the interior.

739
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:35,181
The new minister of the interior.

740
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:38,309
What they call a very new broom.

741
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:43,022
Well, these new ridiculous ideas
have come at last.

742
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:45,608
And orders are orders.

743
01:05:45,817 --> 01:05:49,446
Though I may say to you
in confidence, I do not approve.

744
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:51,865
An eye for an eye, I say.

745
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:55,118
If someone hits you,
you hit back, do you not?

746
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:59,038
Why then should not the state, very
severely hit by you brutal hooligans...

747
01:05:59,247 --> 01:06:01,082
...not hit back also?

748
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,002
The new view is to say "no."

749
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:07,630
The new view is that
we turn the bad into good.

750
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:10,717
All of which seems to me
to be grossly unjust.

751
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:13,720
- Sir--
- Shut your filthy hole, you scum!

752
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,389
You are to be reformed.

753
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:19,767
Tomorrow you will go
to this man, Brodsky.

754
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,644
You will be leaving here.

755
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:26,065
You will be transferred to
the Ludovico medical facility.

756
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:28,067
It's believed you'll be able...

757
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,320
...to leave state custody
in a fortnight.

758
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:32,405
I suppose that prospect
pleases you?

759
01:06:32,614 --> 01:06:34,491
Answer the governor's question!

760
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:36,075
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much.

761
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:38,244
I've done my best here,
I really have, sir.

762
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:41,122
I'm very grateful
to all concerned, sir.

763
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:45,752
Sign this where it's marked.

764
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:51,007
Don't read it, sign it!

765
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:54,969
It says that you are willing to have
your sentence commuted...

766
01:06:55,178 --> 01:06:58,223
...to submission to
the Ludovico treatment.

767
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,766
And this.

768
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,525
And another copy.

769
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:22,914
<i>The next morning I was taken to...</i>

770
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:24,791
<i>...the Ludovico medical facility...</i>

771
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:26,960
<i>...outside the town center.</i>

772
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:28,628
<i>I felt</i> a <i>malenky bit</i> sad...

773
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:30,797
<i>...having to say goodbye
to the old Staja...</i>

774
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:34,384
<i>...as you always will when you leave
a place you've gotten used to.</i>

775
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:36,344
Right, hold the prisoner.

776
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:44,477
Good morning, sir.
I'm Chief Officer Barnes.

777
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:46,563
I've got 655321

778
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:50,483
...on a transfer from Parkmoor
to the Ludovico Centre, sir.

779
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:53,444
Good morning.
Yes, we've been expecting you.

780
01:07:53,653 --> 01:07:54,904
I'm Dr. Alcot.

781
01:07:56,823 --> 01:07:57,991
Dr. Alcot. Very good, sir.

782
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:06,666
- Are you prepared to accept the prisoner?
- Yes, of course.

783
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:10,837
I wonder if you'd mind signing
these transfer documents, sir.

784
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,172
There, sir.

785
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:26,019
And there, sir.

786
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:33,067
And there.

787
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:40,158
Here you go.

788
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:53,546
There you are.

789
01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:57,717
Prison escort, move forward!

790
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:01,929
Halt!

791
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:05,725
Excuse me, sir.

792
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:15,568
Is that the officer that is
to take charge of the prisoner, sir?

793
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:28,665
If I may offer a word of advice, doc,
you'll have to watch this one.

794
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:32,460
A right brutal bastard he has been,
and will be again...

795
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:35,880
...in spite of all his sucking up
and reading the Bible.

796
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:39,801
Oh, I think we can manage things.
Show the young man to his room.

797
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,762
Right, sir. Come this way, please.

798
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:54,148
- Good morning, Charlie.
- Good morning, doctor.

799
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,442
Good morning, Alex.

800
01:09:56,651 --> 01:09:59,320
My name is Dr. Branom.
I'm Dr. Brodsky's assistant.

801
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:01,197
Good morning, missis.
Lovely day.

802
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:02,699
Yes, indeed, it is, sir.

803
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:04,450
May I take that?

804
01:10:08,329 --> 01:10:10,873
- How are you feeling this morning?
- Fine, fine.

805
01:10:11,082 --> 01:10:14,085
Good. Now, in a few minutes
you'll meet Dr. Brodsky...

806
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:15,586
...and begin your treatment.

807
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:18,715
You're a very lucky boy
to have been chosen.

808
01:10:20,258 --> 01:10:23,136
I realize that, and I'm very grateful
to all concerned.

809
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:25,680
We're going to be friends, then,
aren't we?

810
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:27,181
I hope so, missis.

811
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:32,812
What's the hypo for, then?
Gonna send me to sleep?

812
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:34,313
No, nothing of the sort.

813
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:37,483
- Vitamins, will it be, then?
- Something like that.

814
01:10:37,984 --> 01:10:39,193
You're undernourished.

815
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:41,988
So after each meal
we're gonna give you a shot.

816
01:10:42,155 --> 01:10:43,698
Roll over on your right side.

817
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:46,743
Loosen your pajama pants
and pull them halfway down.

818
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:59,672
What exactly is the treatment here
going to be, then?

819
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:02,592
It's quite simple, really.

820
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:05,011
We're going to show you some films.

821
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:07,597
You mean, like
going to the pictures?

822
01:11:07,889 --> 01:11:09,557
Something like that.

823
01:11:09,766 --> 01:11:13,686
Well, that's good. I like to viddy
the old films now and again.

824
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:18,191
<i>And viddy films I would.</i>

825
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:20,359
<i>Where I was taken to, brothers...</i>

826
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:23,070
<i>...was like no cine
I ever viddied before.</i>

827
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:25,615
<i>I was bound up in a straitjacket...</i>

828
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:28,117
<i>...and my gulliver was strapped
to a headrest...</i>

829
01:11:28,326 --> 01:11:30,620
<i>...with, like, wires running away from it.</i>

830
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:33,206
<i>Then they clamped, like,
lid-locks on me eyes...</i>

831
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:36,876
<i>...so that I could not shut them,
no matter how hard I tried.</i>

832
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:38,878
<i>It seemed a bit crazy to me...</i>

833
01:11:39,086 --> 01:11:42,048
<i>...but I let them get on with
what they wanted to get on with.</i>

834
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:45,635
<i>If I was to be a free young malchick
again in a fortnight's time...</i>

835
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:49,305
...I <i>would put up with much
in the meantime,</i> O <i>my brothers.</i>

836
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:18,084
<i>So far, the first film was a very good,
professional piece of cine...</i>

837
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:20,253
<i>...like it was done in Hollywood.</i>

838
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:22,630
<i>The sounds were real horrorshow.</i>

839
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:26,008
<i>You could slooshy the screams
and moans very realistic.</i>

840
01:12:26,217 --> 01:12:28,553
<i>You could even get
the breathing and panting...</i>

841
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:31,764
...of <i>the to/chocking malchicks
at the same time.</i>

842
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,933
<i>And then what do you know?</i>

843
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:36,269
<i>Soon our dear old friend...</i>

844
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:38,521
<i>...the red, red vino on tap...</i>

845
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:42,024
<i>...the same in all places,
like it's put out by the same big firm...</i>

846
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:43,776
<i>...began to flow.</i>

847
01:12:43,985 --> 01:12:46,195
<i>It was beautiful.</i>

848
01:12:46,571 --> 01:12:48,948
<i>It's funny how the colors
of the real world...</i>

849
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:50,950
<i>...only seem really real...</i>

850
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:53,578
<i>...when you viddy them
on a screen.</i>

851
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:59,000
<i>Now, all the time
I was watching this...</i>

852
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,960
...I <i>was beginning
to get very aware...</i>

853
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:03,880
...of, <i>like, not feeling
all that well.</i>

854
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:08,050
<i>And this I put down
to all the rich food and vitamins.</i>

855
01:13:08,259 --> 01:13:12,138
<i>But I tried to forget this,
concentrating on the next film...</i>

856
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:15,558
<i>...which jumped right away
on a young devotchka...</i>

857
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:18,644
<i>...who was being given
the old in-out, in-out...</i>

858
01:13:19,478 --> 01:13:21,647
<i>...first by one malchick...</i>

859
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,649
<i>...then another.</i>

860
01:13:24,609 --> 01:13:26,235
<i>Then another.</i>

861
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:31,657
<i>When it came to
the 6th or 7th malchick...</i>

862
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:35,369
<i>...leering and smecking
and then going into it...</i>

863
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:38,831
<i>...I began to feel really sick.</i>

864
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:42,001
<i>But I could not shut me glazzies.</i>

865
01:13:42,168 --> 01:13:45,671
<i>And even if I tried to move
my glazzballs about...</i>

866
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:47,924
<i>...I still could not get out of...</i>

867
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:50,801
<i>...the line of fire of this picture.</i>

868
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:55,139
Get me up.

869
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:57,308
I'm gonna be sick.

870
01:13:58,309 --> 01:14:00,353
Get something for me to be sick in!

871
01:14:04,649 --> 01:14:07,526
Very soon now,
the drug will cause the subject...

872
01:14:07,735 --> 01:14:10,029
...to experience
a deathlike paralysis...

873
01:14:10,237 --> 01:14:13,532
...together with deep feelings
of terror and helplessness.

874
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:16,535
- I can't stand it anymore.
- One of our early test subjects...

875
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:18,829
...described it as being like death.

876
01:14:19,038 --> 01:14:21,916
A sense of stifling or drowning.

877
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:25,378
And it is during this period,
we have found...

878
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:29,256
...that the subject will make
his most rewarding associations...

879
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:33,260
...between his catastrophic
experience, environment...

880
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,388
...and the violence he sees.

881
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:37,098
Leave me glazzies!

882
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:40,393
Dr. Brodsky is pleased with you.

883
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:42,979
You've made
a very positive response.

884
01:14:44,063 --> 01:14:47,984
Now, tomorrow there will be two
sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.

885
01:14:48,192 --> 01:14:51,237
You mean I have to viddy
two sessions in one day?

886
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:54,699
I imagine you'll be feeling a bit
limp by the end of the day.

887
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:58,244
But we have to be hard on you.
You have to be cured.

888
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:01,372
- It was horrible.
- Of course it was horrible.

889
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:04,083
Violence is a very horrible thing.

890
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,002
That's what you're learning now.

891
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:07,503
Your body's learning it.

892
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:10,923
I just don't understand about
feeling sick the way I did.

893
01:15:11,132 --> 01:15:14,427
I never used to feel sick before.
I used to feel the very opposite.

894
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:17,555
Doing it or watching it,
I used to feel real horrorshow.

895
01:15:18,472 --> 01:15:21,976
You felt ill this afternoon
because you're getting better.

896
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:25,354
When we're healthy, we respond
to the presence of the hateful...

897
01:15:25,563 --> 01:15:27,648
...with fear and nausea.

898
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:30,026
You're becoming healthy, that's all.

899
01:15:30,234 --> 01:15:33,446
By this time tomorrow,
you'll be healthier still.

900
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:28,084
<i>It was the next day, brothers...</i>

901
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:29,877
<i>...and I had truly done my best...</i>

902
01:16:30,086 --> 01:16:32,630
<i>...morning and afternoon
to play it their way...</i>

903
01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:35,633
...and <i>sit like</i> a <i>horrorshow
cooperative malchick...</i>

904
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:37,343
...in the <i>chair of</i> torture...

905
01:16:37,551 --> 01:16:41,847
<i>...while they flashed nasty bits
of ultra-violence on the screen...</i>

906
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:46,727
<i>...though not on the soundtrack, my
brothers, the only sound being music.</i>

907
01:16:47,728 --> 01:16:50,397
<i>Then I noticed,
in all my pain and sickness...</i>

908
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:54,527
<i>...what music it was
that, like, cracked and boomed.</i>

909
01:16:55,402 --> 01:16:57,947
<i>It was Ludwig van.</i>

910
01:16:58,489 --> 01:17:01,033
<i>Ninth Symphony,
fourth movement.</i>

911
01:17:13,212 --> 01:17:16,048
No! No!

912
01:17:16,715 --> 01:17:19,677
Stop it! Stop it!
Please, I beg you!

913
01:17:19,844 --> 01:17:20,845
It's a sin!

914
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:23,472
It's a sin!

915
01:17:23,681 --> 01:17:25,224
It's a sin!

916
01:17:25,391 --> 01:17:28,727
It's a sin! It's a sin!
It's a sin!

917
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:30,104
Sin?

918
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:31,897
What's all this about sin?

919
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:33,357
That!

920
01:17:33,524 --> 01:17:37,570
Using Ludwig van like that.
He did no harm to anyone.

921
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:40,239
Beethoven just wrote music.

922
01:17:40,865 --> 01:17:44,076
Are you referring
to the background score?

923
01:17:44,243 --> 01:17:45,286
Yes!

924
01:17:45,703 --> 01:17:47,580
You've heard Beethoven before?

925
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:49,415
Yes!

926
01:17:49,832 --> 01:17:51,709
So you're keen on music?

927
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:53,919
Yes!

928
01:17:57,006 --> 01:17:58,716
Can't be helped.

929
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:02,303
Here's the punishment
element perhaps.

930
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:05,472
The governor ought to be pleased.

931
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:10,102
I'm sorry, Alex.

932
01:18:10,436 --> 01:18:12,188
This is for your own good.

933
01:18:12,396 --> 01:18:14,815
You'll have to bear with us
for a while.

934
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:19,653
But it's not fair. It's not fair
I should feel ill when I hear...

935
01:18:19,862 --> 01:18:22,489
...lovely, lovely Ludwig van.

936
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:25,409
You must take your chance, boy.

937
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:28,329
The choice has been all yours.

938
01:18:29,872 --> 01:18:32,625
You needn't take it any further, sir.

939
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:35,920
You've proved to me all this
ultra-violence and killing...

940
01:18:36,128 --> 01:18:39,340
...is wrong, wrong
and terribly wrong!

941
01:18:39,798 --> 01:18:41,550
I've learned me lesson, sir.

942
01:18:41,759 --> 01:18:44,720
I see now what I've
never seen before.

943
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:47,932
I'm cured. Praise God!

944
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:50,643
You're not cured yet, boy.

945
01:18:51,518 --> 01:18:54,605
But, sirs. Missis!

946
01:18:54,813 --> 01:18:56,982
I see that it's wrong!

947
01:18:57,149 --> 01:19:01,237
It's wrong because
it's, like, against society.

948
01:19:01,445 --> 01:19:04,156
Because everybody has the
right to live and be happy...

949
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:07,201
...without being
tolchocked and knifed!

950
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:10,579
No, no, boy.
You really must leave it to us.

951
01:19:10,788 --> 01:19:12,498
But be cheerful about it.

952
01:19:12,706 --> 01:19:16,001
In less than a fortnight now,
you'll be a free man.

953
01:19:54,498 --> 01:19:55,749
Ladies and gentlemen...

954
01:19:55,958 --> 01:19:58,877
...at this stage we introduce
the subject himself.

955
01:19:59,086 --> 01:20:02,131
He is, as you will perceive,
fit and well-nourished.

956
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:05,217
He comes straight from a night's
sleep and a good breakfast...

957
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:08,470
...undrugged, unhypnotized.

958
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:12,433
Tomorrow we send him out with
confidence into the world again...

959
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:16,312
...as decent a lad as you
would meet on a May morning.

960
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:19,898
What a change is here,
ladies and gentlemen.

961
01:20:20,107 --> 01:20:22,109
From the hoodlum
the state committed...

962
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:25,529
...to unprofitable punishment
some two years ago.

963
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:28,574
Unchanged after two years.

964
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:31,410
Unchanged, do I say?

965
01:20:31,577 --> 01:20:33,203
Not quite.

966
01:20:33,412 --> 01:20:38,167
Prison taught him the false smile,
the rubbed hands of hypocrisy.

967
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:41,670
The fawning, greased,
obsequious leer.

968
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:44,131
Other vices it taught him...

969
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:48,260
...as well as confirming him in
those he had long practiced before.

970
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:52,514
Our party promised
to restore law and order...

971
01:20:52,723 --> 01:20:56,810
...and to make the streets safe again
for the ordinary peace-loving citizen.

972
01:20:57,019 --> 01:21:01,106
This pledge is now
about to become a reality.

973
01:21:01,315 --> 01:21:05,069
Ladies and gentlemen,
today is an historic moment.

974
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:09,740
The problem of criminal violence
is soon to be a thing of the past.

975
01:21:10,783 --> 01:21:12,701
But enough of words.

976
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:15,204
Actions speak louder than.

977
01:21:15,412 --> 01:21:17,081
Action now.

978
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:19,625
Observe all.

979
01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:31,804
Our necks are out
a long way on this, minister.

980
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:34,181
I have complete faith in Brodsky.

981
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:37,559
If the polls are right,
we have nothing to lose.

982
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:49,029
Hello, heap of dirt.

983
01:21:51,782 --> 01:21:53,617
You don't wash much, do you?

984
01:21:53,826 --> 01:21:56,161
Judging by the horrible smell.

985
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:59,164
Why do you say that?
I had a shower this morning.

986
01:21:59,373 --> 01:22:02,000
Oh, he had a shower this morning.

987
01:22:02,376 --> 01:22:05,671
- You trying to call me a liar?
- No, brother.

988
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:09,091
Well, you must think I'm awfully stupid.

989
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:16,598
Why did you do that, brother?

990
01:22:16,807 --> 01:22:18,851
I've never done wrong to you.

991
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:21,186
You want to know why I did that?

992
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:22,604
Well, you see...

993
01:22:22,855 --> 01:22:24,189
...I do this...

994
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:25,566
...and that...

995
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:29,027
...and this because I don't like
your horrible type, do I?

996
01:22:29,236 --> 01:22:31,697
And if you want
to start something...

997
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:35,826
...well, you just go ahead.
Go on! Please do!

998
01:22:36,827 --> 01:22:39,955
- Go on!
- I'm gonna be sick. I'm gonna be sick.

999
01:22:40,122 --> 01:22:41,540
You're gonna be sick, are you?

1000
01:22:41,707 --> 01:22:44,418
I'm gonna be sick.
Please let me get up.

1001
01:22:45,169 --> 01:22:46,753
You wanna get up?

1002
01:22:47,171 --> 01:22:48,881
Well, now you listen to me.

1003
01:22:49,506 --> 01:22:51,175
If you wanna get up...

1004
01:22:51,675 --> 01:22:53,635
...you've gotta
do something for me.

1005
01:22:54,344 --> 01:22:57,097
Here. Here.

1006
01:22:57,848 --> 01:22:59,516
You see that?

1007
01:23:00,476 --> 01:23:01,977
You see that shoe?

1008
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:04,813
Well, I want you to lick it.

1009
01:23:05,022 --> 01:23:06,315
Go on!

1010
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:08,859
Lick it.

1011
01:23:11,904 --> 01:23:14,323
<i>And, O my brothers,
would you believe...</i>

1012
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:17,826
<i>...your faithful friend
and long-suffering narrator...</i>

1013
01:23:18,035 --> 01:23:20,537
<i>...pushed out his red yabzick
a mile and a half...</i>

1014
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:23,582
...to <i>lick the grahzny,
vonny boots.</i>

1015
01:23:24,374 --> 01:23:25,417
And again!

1016
01:23:25,584 --> 01:23:28,086
<i>The horrible killing sickness
had whooshed up...</i>

1017
01:23:28,295 --> 01:23:30,422
<i>...and turned the, like, joy of battle...</i>

1018
01:23:30,589 --> 01:23:33,425
<i>...into</i> a <i>feeling
I was going to snuff it.</i>

1019
01:23:33,592 --> 01:23:34,927
And again.

1020
01:23:35,427 --> 01:23:37,429
Nice and clean.

1021
01:23:39,973 --> 01:23:41,225
Thank you very much.

1022
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:43,268
That will do very well.

1023
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:49,858
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

1024
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,610
Thank you.

1025
01:23:52,945 --> 01:23:54,821
Thank you very much.

1026
01:23:56,114 --> 01:23:58,450
Thank you very much.

1027
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:01,930
<i>She came towards me...</i>

1028
01:25:02,139 --> 01:25:05,892
<i>...with the light like it was the
light light of heavenly grace.</i>

1029
01:25:06,059 --> 01:25:08,395
<i>And the thing that flashed
into me gulliver...</i>

1030
01:25:08,604 --> 01:25:11,315
...was <i>that I'd like to have her
there on the floor...</i>

1031
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:14,693
<i>...with the old in-out,
real savage.</i>

1032
01:25:30,709 --> 01:25:33,211
<i>But quick as a shot
came the sickness.</i>

1033
01:25:33,378 --> 01:25:36,048
<i>Like a detective who'd been
watching around the corner...</i>

1034
01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:39,551
...and <i>now followed
to make his arrest.</i>

1035
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:53,482
Enough.

1036
01:25:53,899 --> 01:25:55,484
Thank you very much.

1037
01:25:55,692 --> 01:25:57,444
Thank you, my dear.

1038
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:02,741
Thank you very much.

1039
01:26:19,299 --> 01:26:22,010
Not feeling too bad now, are you?

1040
01:26:22,302 --> 01:26:24,680
No, sir. I feel really great, sir.

1041
01:26:24,888 --> 01:26:26,848
- Good.
- Was it all right, sir?

1042
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:28,016
Did I do well, sir?

1043
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:31,436
Fine, my boy.
Absolutely fine.

1044
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:33,105
You see, ladies and gentlemen...

1045
01:26:33,271 --> 01:26:35,774
...our subject is impelled
towards the good...

1046
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:39,695
...by paradoxically
being impelled towards evil.

1047
01:26:39,903 --> 01:26:41,655
The intention to act violently...

1048
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:45,283
...is accompanied by strong
feelings of physical distress.

1049
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:48,245
To counter these,
the subject has to switch...

1050
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:51,456
...to a diametrically opposed attitude.

1051
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,458
Any questions?

1052
01:26:53,667 --> 01:26:55,127
Choice.

1053
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:02,092
The boy has no real choice, has he?

1054
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:03,885
Self-interest.

1055
01:27:04,094 --> 01:27:06,012
The fear of physical pain...

1056
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:10,684
...drove him to that
grotesque act of self-abasement.

1057
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:13,645
Its insincerity was clearly to be seen.

1058
01:27:13,812 --> 01:27:15,814
He ceases to be a wrongdoer.

1059
01:27:15,981 --> 01:27:20,569
He ceases also to be
a creature capable of moral choice.

1060
01:27:20,777 --> 01:27:23,196
Padre, these are subtleties.

1061
01:27:23,405 --> 01:27:26,575
We're not concerned with motives,
with the higher ethics.

1062
01:27:26,783 --> 01:27:30,495
We are concerned only
with cutting down crime.

1063
01:27:32,831 --> 01:27:37,377
And with relieving the ghastly
congestion in our prisons.

1064
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:40,380
He will be your true Christian...

1065
01:27:40,589 --> 01:27:42,716
...ready to turn the other cheek.

1066
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:46,011
Ready to be crucified,
rather than crucify.

1067
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:50,348
Sick to the very heart at the
thought even of killing a fly.

1068
01:27:50,557 --> 01:27:51,933
Reclamation.

1069
01:27:52,142 --> 01:27:54,478
Joy before the angels of God.

1070
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:57,814
The point is that it works!

1071
01:28:02,194 --> 01:28:05,572
<i>And the very next day,
your friend and humble narrator...</i>

1072
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:07,824
<i>...was a free man.</i>

1073
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:47,656
SQn!

1074
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:52,702
- Hi, hi, hi there, my Pee and Em.
- Alex.

1075
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:54,162
Mum.

1076
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:58,291
How are you, love?
Nice to see you.

1077
01:28:59,918 --> 01:29:02,295
- Dad.
- Hello, lad. What a surprise.

1078
01:29:02,504 --> 01:29:04,673
- Good to see you.
- Keeping fit?

1079
01:29:05,423 --> 01:29:09,094
- How are you, then? How are you?
- Oh, I'm fine, fine.

1080
01:29:09,261 --> 01:29:11,263
Keeping out of trouble, you know.

1081
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,223
Well...

1082
01:29:13,974 --> 01:29:15,684
...I'm back!

1083
01:29:17,143 --> 01:29:18,270
Yes.

1084
01:29:18,436 --> 01:29:19,479
Good to see you.

1085
01:29:19,688 --> 01:29:21,940
Why didn't you let us know
what was happening?

1086
01:29:22,107 --> 01:29:26,361
Sorry, Em. I wanted it to be, like,
a big surprise for you and Pee.

1087
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:29,489
It's a surprise all right.
A bit bewildering too.

1088
01:29:29,739 --> 01:29:32,576
We've only just read about it
in morning papers.

1089
01:29:32,784 --> 01:29:34,661
Aye. You should have
let us know, lad.

1090
01:29:35,328 --> 01:29:39,291
Not that we're not very pleased
to see you again, and all...

1091
01:29:39,499 --> 01:29:41,001
...cured too, eh?

1092
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:43,420
That's right, Dad.
They did a great job on me.

1093
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:46,256
I'm completely reformed.

1094
01:29:47,132 --> 01:29:48,508
Well...

1095
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:51,636
Still the same old place, then, eh?

1096
01:29:52,512 --> 01:29:54,180
Oh, aye. Aye, aye-

1097
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,522
Hey, Dad...

1098
01:30:04,107 --> 01:30:06,985
...there's a strange fella
sitting on the sofa...

1099
01:30:07,193 --> 01:30:10,405
...munchy-wunching
lomticks of toast.

1100
01:30:13,366 --> 01:30:16,786
That's Joe. He--

1101
01:30:17,037 --> 01:30:18,997
He lives here now.

1102
01:30:19,331 --> 01:30:20,665
Thelodgen

1103
01:30:20,874 --> 01:30:22,459
That's what he is.

1104
01:30:22,876 --> 01:30:24,878
He rents your room.

1105
01:30:35,597 --> 01:30:37,015
How do you do, Joe?

1106
01:30:37,223 --> 01:30:39,351
Find the room comfortable, do you?

1107
01:30:39,559 --> 01:30:41,519
No complaints?

1108
01:30:44,522 --> 01:30:46,441
I've heard about you.

1109
01:30:47,525 --> 01:30:49,319
I know what you've done.

1110
01:30:53,615 --> 01:30:57,243
Breaking the hearts of your
poor, grieving parents.

1111
01:30:58,328 --> 01:31:00,080
So you're back, eh?

1112
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:04,918
You're back to make life a misery for
your lovely parents once more, is that it?

1113
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:06,753
Over my dead corpse, you will.

1114
01:31:06,962 --> 01:31:10,256
Because, you see, they've let me
be more like a son to them...

1115
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:13,927
-...than like a lodger.
- Joe. Joe!

1116
01:31:14,094 --> 01:31:16,638
Don't go fighting here, boys.

1117
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,396
Do put your hand
over your mouth, please.

1118
01:31:24,604 --> 01:31:25,855
It's bloody revolting.

1119
01:31:31,361 --> 01:31:33,947
- Are you all right, lad?
- Dad.

1120
01:31:34,114 --> 01:31:35,865
It's the treatment.

1121
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:38,702
Well, it's disgusting.
Enough to put you off your food.

1122
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:42,706
Leave him be, Joe.
It's the treatment.

1123
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:47,585
Do you think we ought
to do something?

1124
01:31:48,712 --> 01:31:52,007
Would you like me to make you
a nice cup of tea, son?

1125
01:32:02,767 --> 01:32:05,937
What have you done
with all me own personal things?

1126
01:32:06,104 --> 01:32:09,065
Oh, well...

1127
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:12,944
...that was all...

1128
01:32:13,111 --> 01:32:14,863
...took away, son.

1129
01:32:15,405 --> 01:32:17,198
By the police.

1130
01:32:17,615 --> 01:32:18,742
New regulation, see...

1131
01:32:18,908 --> 01:32:22,829
...about compensation
for the victims.

1132
01:32:25,623 --> 01:32:27,292
What about Basil?

1133
01:32:30,128 --> 01:32:31,963
Where's my snake?

1134
01:32:37,677 --> 01:32:39,179
Well...

1135
01:32:42,307 --> 01:32:43,516
...he met with...

1136
01:32:43,725 --> 01:32:45,518
...like, an accident.

1137
01:32:49,355 --> 01:32:50,899
He passed away.

1138
01:32:56,196 --> 01:32:58,323
What's going to happen to me, then?

1139
01:33:00,617 --> 01:33:01,826
I mean...

1140
01:33:02,869 --> 01:33:04,454
...that's my room he's in.

1141
01:33:04,662 --> 01:33:06,498
There's no denying that.

1142
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:10,168
This is my home also.

1143
01:33:12,087 --> 01:33:15,507
What suggestions have you,
my Pee and Em, to make?

1144
01:33:20,428 --> 01:33:24,015
Well, all this needs thinking about, son.

1145
01:33:25,308 --> 01:33:28,144
We can't very well just kick Joe out.

1146
01:33:28,353 --> 01:33:30,230
Not just like that, can we?

1147
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:31,523
I mean...

1148
01:33:31,731 --> 01:33:33,733
...Joe's here doing a job.

1149
01:33:33,942 --> 01:33:36,277
A contract it is. Two years.

1150
01:33:36,486 --> 01:33:40,198
We made, like, an arrangement.
Didn't we, Joe?

1151
01:33:41,991 --> 01:33:43,868
You see, son...

1152
01:33:44,035 --> 01:33:48,748
...Joe's paid next month's
rent already...

1153
01:33:50,375 --> 01:33:53,211
...so whatever we may do in
the future, we can't just say...

1154
01:33:53,378 --> 01:33:56,464
...to get out, now can we?

1155
01:33:56,881 --> 01:33:58,716
No, but it's much more than that.

1156
01:33:59,634 --> 01:34:02,053
I mean, I've got you two
to think of...

1157
01:34:02,262 --> 01:34:05,181
...who've been like
a father and mother to me.

1158
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:08,393
It wouldn't be right for me
to go off and leave you two...

1159
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:11,563
...to the tender mercies
of this young monster...

1160
01:34:11,729 --> 01:34:15,066
...who's been like
no real son at all.

1161
01:34:15,692 --> 01:34:18,027
Look, he's weeping now.

1162
01:34:18,236 --> 01:34:21,197
But that's all his craft
and artfulness.

1163
01:34:21,531 --> 01:34:24,284
Let him go and find
a room somewhere else.

1164
01:34:24,492 --> 01:34:28,872
Let him learn the errors of his way,
and that a bad boy, like he's been...

1165
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:32,584
...doesn't deserve such a good
mum and dad as he's had.

1166
01:34:38,256 --> 01:34:39,591
All right.

1167
01:34:40,633 --> 01:34:42,552
I know how things are now.

1168
01:34:43,970 --> 01:34:46,681
I've suffered and I've suffered...

1169
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:48,850
...and I've suffered.

1170
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:52,729
And everybody wants me
to go on suffering.

1171
01:34:54,689 --> 01:34:56,858
You've made others suffer.

1172
01:34:57,400 --> 01:35:00,528
It's only right
that you should suffer proper.

1173
01:35:01,362 --> 01:35:03,198
I've been told
everything you've done...

1174
01:35:03,406 --> 01:35:05,408
...sitting here at night
around the table.

1175
01:35:05,617 --> 01:35:08,703
And pretty shocking
it was to listen to.

1176
01:35:09,579 --> 01:35:12,790
It made me real sick,
a lot of it did.

1177
01:35:14,667 --> 01:35:18,296
Now look what you've gone
and done to your mother.

1178
01:35:18,504 --> 01:35:20,215
Come on. It's all right now.

1179
01:35:33,102 --> 01:35:34,312
Right.

1180
01:35:35,021 --> 01:35:36,814
I'm leaving now.

1181
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:39,150
You won't ever viddy me no more.

1182
01:35:39,317 --> 01:35:41,110
I'll make me own way.

1183
01:35:41,486 --> 01:35:45,198
Thank you very much. Let it lie
heavy on your consciences.

1184
01:35:46,574 --> 01:35:49,494
Now, don't take it like that, son.

1185
01:35:53,498 --> 01:35:55,250
All right.

1186
01:36:51,681 --> 01:36:54,642
Can you spare some cutter,
me brother?

1187
01:36:56,477 --> 01:36:59,605
Can you spare some cutter,
me brother?

1188
01:37:03,276 --> 01:37:06,321
Can you spare some cutter,
me brother?

1189
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:29,093
Thanks, brother.

1190
01:37:47,070 --> 01:37:48,946
Janie Mack!

1191
01:37:49,405 --> 01:37:50,865
May the hokey fly!

1192
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:54,744
Holy Mother of God and all the blessed
saints in heaven preserve us!

1193
01:37:56,412 --> 01:37:58,581
I never forget a face, be God!

1194
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:00,124
I never forget any face.

1195
01:38:00,333 --> 01:38:03,169
Leave me alone, brother.
I've never seen you before!

1196
01:38:03,378 --> 01:38:06,964
This is the poisonous young swine
that near done me in.

1197
01:38:07,131 --> 01:38:08,341
Him and his friends.

1198
01:38:08,549 --> 01:38:11,469
They beat me and kicked me
and punched me.

1199
01:38:11,636 --> 01:38:13,262
Stop him! Stop him!

1200
01:38:13,471 --> 01:38:17,475
They laughed at me blood
and me moans, this murderous dog!

1201
01:38:17,642 --> 01:38:21,020
<i>Then there was like
a sea of dirty, smelly old men...</i>

1202
01:38:21,229 --> 01:38:23,398
...trying to get at
your humble narrator...

1203
01:38:23,606 --> 01:38:27,276
<i>...with their feeble rookers
and horny old claws.</i>

1204
01:38:27,485 --> 01:38:30,363
<i>It was old age
having a go at youth.</i>

1205
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:34,325
<i>And I daren't do a single
solitary thing, O my brothers.</i>

1206
01:38:34,534 --> 01:38:36,577
<i>It being better
to be hit at like that...</i>

1207
01:38:36,786 --> 01:38:39,455
<i>...than want to sick
and feel that horrible pain.</i>

1208
01:38:39,664 --> 01:38:41,082
All right, all right!

1209
01:38:41,249 --> 01:38:42,250
Stop it now.

1210
01:38:42,458 --> 01:38:45,837
Come on. Stop breaking the
state's peace, you naughty boys!

1211
01:38:46,045 --> 01:38:48,923
Back away! Go away with you!

1212
01:38:49,132 --> 01:38:51,426
What's your trouble, sir?

1213
01:38:53,886 --> 01:38:55,596
Oh, no.

1214
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:00,518
Well.

1215
01:39:01,102 --> 01:39:03,604
Well, well, well.

1216
01:39:03,896 --> 01:39:07,358
Well, well, well, well.

1217
01:39:07,525 --> 01:39:11,696
If it isn't little Alex.
Long time no viddy, droog.

1218
01:39:11,904 --> 01:39:13,406
How goes?

1219
01:39:13,573 --> 01:39:16,325
It's impossible.
I don't believe it.

1220
01:39:16,534 --> 01:39:18,494
Evidence of the old glazzies.

1221
01:39:18,703 --> 01:39:20,538
Nothing up our sleeves.

1222
01:39:20,705 --> 01:39:22,832
No magic, little Alex.

1223
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:26,544
A job for two
who are now of job age:

1224
01:39:26,836 --> 01:39:28,296
The police.

1225
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:45,229
Come on, Alex.

1226
01:39:45,438 --> 01:39:47,064
Come for walking.

1227
01:39:58,576 --> 01:40:01,078
Come, come, come,
my little droogies.

1228
01:40:01,245 --> 01:40:02,872
I just don't get this at all.

1229
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:05,166
The old days are dead and gone.

1230
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:07,460
For what I did in the past,
I've been punished.

1231
01:40:07,627 --> 01:40:09,337
- Punished.
- I've been cured.

1232
01:40:09,504 --> 01:40:11,756
Cured, yeah.
That was read out to us.

1233
01:40:11,964 --> 01:40:13,883
The inspector read it
all out to us.

1234
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:16,761
He said it was a very good way.

1235
01:40:16,969 --> 01:40:18,262
But what is all this?

1236
01:40:18,554 --> 01:40:21,057
It was them
that went for me, brothers.

1237
01:40:21,265 --> 01:40:23,976
You're not on their side,
and can't be.

1238
01:40:24,519 --> 01:40:26,771
Well, you can't be, Dim.

1239
01:40:26,979 --> 01:40:29,690
It was someone we fillied with
back in the old days...

1240
01:40:29,899 --> 01:40:33,361
...trying to get his own revenge
after all this time. Remember, Dim?

1241
01:40:33,569 --> 01:40:35,112
A long time is right.

1242
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:37,532
I don't remember them days
too horrorshow.

1243
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:39,909
And don't call me Dim
no more, either.

1244
01:40:40,117 --> 01:40:42,203
"Officer," call me.

1245
01:40:42,537 --> 01:40:45,957
Enough is remembered, though,
little Alex.

1246
01:40:46,624 --> 01:40:49,710
And this is to make sure
you stay cured.

1247
01:41:45,558 --> 01:41:49,604
- He's had enough, droogie.
- A bit more. He's still kicking.

1248
01:42:08,456 --> 01:42:10,374
Cured, are you?

1249
01:42:11,959 --> 01:42:15,796
Be viddying you some more
sometime, droogie.

1250
01:42:31,103 --> 01:42:35,149
<i>Where was I to go,
who had no home and no money?</i>

1251
01:42:35,358 --> 01:42:37,526
<i>I cried for meself.</i>

1252
01:42:37,902 --> 01:42:40,696
<i>Home, home, home.</i>

1253
01:42:40,946 --> 01:42:42,865
<i>It was home I was wanting.</i>

1254
01:42:43,074 --> 01:42:46,118
<i>And it was home
I came to, brothers...</i>

1255
01:42:46,327 --> 01:42:48,954
<i>...not realizing,
in the state I was</i> in...

1256
01:42:49,163 --> 01:42:52,249
<i>...where I was, and had been before.</i>

1257
01:43:40,506 --> 01:43:42,508
Who on earth could that be?

1258
01:43:57,940 --> 01:43:59,650
I'll see who it is.

1259
01:44:11,162 --> 01:44:12,747
Yes, what is it?

1260
01:44:21,464 --> 01:44:22,673
Please...

1261
01:44:39,565 --> 01:44:42,902
Frank, I think this young man
needs some help.

1262
01:44:47,698 --> 01:44:49,074
My God!

1263
01:44:50,034 --> 01:44:52,286
What's happened to you, my boy?

1264
01:44:54,789 --> 01:44:58,459
<i>And would you believe it,
O my brothers and only friends...</i>

1265
01:44:58,667 --> 01:45:00,961
...there was <i>your</i> faithful narrator...

1266
01:45:01,170 --> 01:45:03,672
<i>...being held helpless
like a babe in arms...</i>

1267
01:45:03,881 --> 01:45:06,342
<i>...and suddenly realizing
where he was...</i>

1268
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:09,929
<i>...and why "home" on the gate
had looked so familiar.</i>

1269
01:45:10,137 --> 01:45:11,931
<i>But I knew I was safe.</i>

1270
01:45:12,139 --> 01:45:14,225
<i>I knew he would not remember me.</i>

1271
01:45:14,433 --> 01:45:16,268
<i>For in those carefree days...</i>

1272
01:45:16,477 --> 01:45:18,395
<i>...I and my so-called droogs...</i>

1273
01:45:18,604 --> 01:45:22,149
<i>...wore our maskies, which were
like real horrorshow disguises.</i>

1274
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:24,568
Police.

1275
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:30,449
Ghastly, horrible police.

1276
01:45:32,368 --> 01:45:34,036
They beat me up, sir.

1277
01:45:38,290 --> 01:45:40,751
The police beat me up, sir.

1278
01:45:42,670 --> 01:45:44,463
I know you!

1279
01:45:48,634 --> 01:45:50,803
Isn't it your picture
in the newspapers?

1280
01:45:51,011 --> 01:45:53,180
Didn't I see you
on the video this morning?

1281
01:45:53,347 --> 01:45:56,809
Are you not the poor victim
of this horrible new technique?

1282
01:45:57,101 --> 01:45:58,435
Yes, sir.

1283
01:45:58,769 --> 01:46:02,106
That's exactly who I am and
what I am, sir. A victim, sir.

1284
01:46:02,273 --> 01:46:05,442
Then, by God, you've been
sent here by providence!

1285
01:46:05,651 --> 01:46:08,821
Tortured in prison, then thrown out
to be tortured by the police.

1286
01:46:09,029 --> 01:46:13,576
My heart goes out to you, poor boy.
You're not the first to come here in distress.

1287
01:46:13,784 --> 01:46:16,662
The police like to bring
their victims to this village.

1288
01:46:16,829 --> 01:46:18,372
But it's providential that you...

1289
01:46:18,581 --> 01:46:22,084
...who are also another kind
of victim, should come here.

1290
01:46:24,003 --> 01:46:27,131
Oh, but you're cold and shivering.

1291
01:46:27,506 --> 01:46:29,008
Julian...

1292
01:46:29,258 --> 01:46:31,468
...draw a bath for this young man.

1293
01:46:31,677 --> 01:46:33,095
Certainly, Frank.

1294
01:46:33,304 --> 01:46:35,055
Thank you very much, sir.

1295
01:46:35,264 --> 01:46:36,849
God bless you, sir.

1296
01:47:31,862 --> 01:47:34,198
He can be the most potent
weapon imaginable...

1297
01:47:34,365 --> 01:47:37,576
...to ensure the government
is not returned in the election.

1298
01:47:37,785 --> 01:47:39,578
The government's big boast, sir...

1299
01:47:39,745 --> 01:47:42,623
...is the way they have
dealt with crime the last few months.

1300
01:47:42,790 --> 01:47:44,708
Recruiting young roughs
into the police...

1301
01:47:44,875 --> 01:47:48,003
...proposing will-sapping
techniques of conditioning.

1302
01:47:48,212 --> 01:47:50,464
We've seen it all before
in other countries.

1303
01:47:50,673 --> 01:47:52,216
The thin end of the wedge.

1304
01:47:52,383 --> 01:47:56,512
Before we know where we are, we'll
have the full apparatus of totalitarianism.

1305
01:48:00,391 --> 01:48:04,895
This young boy is a living witness
to these diabolical proposals.

1306
01:48:05,104 --> 01:48:08,941
The people, the common people,
must know, must see.

1307
01:48:09,149 --> 01:48:13,570
There are traditions of liberty to
defend. The tradition of liberty is all.

1308
01:48:13,737 --> 01:48:18,200
The common people will let it go, yes.
They will sell liberty for a quieter life.

1309
01:48:18,409 --> 01:48:22,246
That is why they must be led, sir.
Driven, pushed.

1310
01:48:27,334 --> 01:48:28,585
Fine.

1311
01:48:29,586 --> 01:48:31,255
Thank you very much, sir.

1312
01:48:33,257 --> 01:48:34,717
He'll be here.

1313
01:49:59,510 --> 01:50:00,969
Good evening, sir.

1314
01:50:04,890 --> 01:50:06,517
Good evening.

1315
01:50:07,017 --> 01:50:09,895
It was very kind of you
to leave this out for me.

1316
01:50:10,104 --> 01:50:12,564
There was no one around,
so I started.

1317
01:50:12,773 --> 01:50:14,566
Hope that's all right, sir.

1318
01:50:18,153 --> 01:50:19,822
Of course.

1319
01:50:50,811 --> 01:50:53,147
Food all right?

1320
01:50:58,902 --> 01:51:00,571
Great, sir. Great.

1321
01:51:03,574 --> 01:51:05,784
Try the wine.

1322
01:51:12,124 --> 01:51:13,500
Thank you, sir.

1323
01:51:16,128 --> 01:51:17,379
Cheers.

1324
01:51:19,423 --> 01:51:20,674
Happy days.

1325
01:51:31,185 --> 01:51:34,062
- Won't you join me?
- No.

1326
01:51:34,229 --> 01:51:36,440
My health doesn't allow it.

1327
01:51:37,274 --> 01:51:38,609
No, thank you.

1328
01:51:44,573 --> 01:51:47,034
"1960, Chéteau.

1329
01:51:47,576 --> 01:51:49,494
Saint-Estéphe.

1330
01:51:49,661 --> 01:51:51,788
Médoc." Very good brand, sir.

1331
01:52:00,339 --> 01:52:01,548
Very good...

1332
01:52:01,757 --> 01:52:03,008
...color, sir.

1333
01:52:07,179 --> 01:52:08,931
It smells nice too.

1334
01:52:23,820 --> 01:52:25,822
A very nice little number, sir.

1335
01:52:25,989 --> 01:52:28,450
Well, here's to it.

1336
01:52:37,167 --> 01:52:39,253
Very refreshing, sir.
Very refreshing.

1337
01:52:39,419 --> 01:52:42,839
I'm pleased you
appreciate good wine.

1338
01:52:44,007 --> 01:52:45,842
Have another glass.

1339
01:52:54,142 --> 01:52:55,811
Thank you, sir.

1340
01:52:59,022 --> 01:53:00,399
My wife...

1341
01:53:01,858 --> 01:53:05,445
...used to do everything for me
and leave me to my writing.

1342
01:53:08,198 --> 01:53:09,992
Your wife, sir? Is she away?

1343
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:12,536
No, she's dead!

1344
01:53:16,540 --> 01:53:18,542
I'm sorry to hear about that, sir.

1345
01:53:18,750 --> 01:53:21,128
She was very badly raped, you see.

1346
01:53:21,336 --> 01:53:23,672
We were assaulted by
vicious young hoodlums...

1347
01:53:23,839 --> 01:53:26,425
...in this very room
you're sitting in now.

1348
01:53:26,633 --> 01:53:31,388
I was left a helpless cripple, but
for her the agony was too great.

1349
01:53:31,722 --> 01:53:33,557
The doctors said
it was pneumonia...

1350
01:53:33,765 --> 01:53:36,643
...because it happened later,
during a flu epidemic.

1351
01:53:36,852 --> 01:53:41,189
The doctors told me it was
pneumonia, but I knew what it was.

1352
01:53:41,398 --> 01:53:45,736
A victim of the modern age.
Poor, poor girl.

1353
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:51,283
And now, you.

1354
01:53:51,908 --> 01:53:54,911
Another victim of the modern age.

1355
01:53:55,245 --> 01:53:57,205
But you can be helped.

1356
01:53:58,206 --> 01:54:01,710
I phoned some friends while
you were having your bath.

1357
01:54:01,918 --> 01:54:05,881
- Some friends, sir?
- Yes. They want to help you.

1358
01:54:06,089 --> 01:54:08,425
- Help me, sir?
- Help you.

1359
01:54:08,633 --> 01:54:12,137
- Who are they, sir?
- They're very, very important people.

1360
01:54:12,346 --> 01:54:14,765
And they're interested in you.

1361
01:54:16,850 --> 01:54:18,685
Julian.

1362
01:54:20,228 --> 01:54:22,314
This'll be these people now.

1363
01:54:22,481 --> 01:54:25,317
I don't want to trouble you
any further. I should be leaving.

1364
01:54:25,484 --> 01:54:29,112
No, no, no, my boy.
No trouble at all.

1365
01:54:29,821 --> 01:54:31,031
Here.

1366
01:54:31,281 --> 01:54:33,200
Let me fill your glass.

1367
01:54:54,137 --> 01:54:56,640
- Hello, Frank.
- Good evening, sir.

1368
01:54:56,807 --> 01:54:58,433
Frank.

1369
01:54:59,017 --> 01:55:00,769
So this is the young man?

1370
01:55:02,104 --> 01:55:03,563
- How do you do, sir?
- Hello.

1371
01:55:03,980 --> 01:55:06,817
- Missis. I'm very pleased to meet you.
- Hello.

1372
01:55:06,983 --> 01:55:09,486
I hope you forgive us for coming
at this hour...

1373
01:55:09,653 --> 01:55:11,613
...but we heard you
were in trouble...

1374
01:55:11,822 --> 01:55:14,157
...and so we came over to see
if we could help.

1375
01:55:14,366 --> 01:55:16,660
Very kind of you, sir.
Thank you very much.

1376
01:55:16,827 --> 01:55:19,162
I understand you had a rather...

1377
01:55:19,329 --> 01:55:22,374
...unfortunate encounter...

1378
01:55:22,582 --> 01:55:24,334
...with the police tonight.

1379
01:55:24,626 --> 01:55:26,753
Yes, I suppose
you could call it that, sir.

1380
01:55:26,962 --> 01:55:28,338
How are you feeling now?

1381
01:55:28,505 --> 01:55:29,840
Much better, thank you, sir.

1382
01:55:30,006 --> 01:55:32,426
Feel like talking,
answering a few questions?

1383
01:55:32,634 --> 01:55:34,010
Fine, sir. Fine.

1384
01:55:34,803 --> 01:55:37,514
Well, as I said, we've heard about you.

1385
01:55:37,848 --> 01:55:40,684
We are interested in your case.

1386
01:55:40,851 --> 01:55:43,770
- We want to help you.
- Thank you very much, sir.

1387
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:47,232
Well, shall we get down to it?

1388
01:55:47,441 --> 01:55:49,192
Fine. Fine, sir.

1389
01:55:54,531 --> 01:55:57,284
The newspapers mentioned...

1390
01:55:57,492 --> 01:56:00,120
...that in addition to your being
conditioned against...

1391
01:56:00,328 --> 01:56:01,872
...acts of sex and violence...

1392
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:05,208
...you've inadvertently been
conditioned against music.

1393
01:56:05,375 --> 01:56:09,546
Well, I think that was something
that they didn't plan for.

1394
01:56:09,754 --> 01:56:11,715
You see, missis...

1395
01:56:11,882 --> 01:56:15,385
...I'm very fond of music.
Especially Beethoven.

1396
01:56:16,553 --> 01:56:18,555
Ludwig van Beethoven.

1397
01:56:18,763 --> 01:56:21,057
43-5--
- It's all right. Thank you.

1398
01:56:21,558 --> 01:56:25,729
And it just so happened that
while they were showing me...

1399
01:56:25,896 --> 01:56:29,900
...a particularly bad film
of, like, a concentration camp...

1400
01:56:30,066 --> 01:56:33,695
...the background music
was playing Beethoven.

1401
01:56:33,904 --> 01:56:36,698
So now you have
the same reaction to music...

1402
01:56:36,907 --> 01:56:38,700
...as you do to sex and violence?

1403
01:56:38,909 --> 01:56:43,205
No, missis. You see, it's not
all music. It's just the 9th.

1404
01:56:43,413 --> 01:56:45,248
You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?

1405
01:56:45,415 --> 01:56:48,502
That's right. I can't listen
to the 9th anymore at all.

1406
01:56:48,710 --> 01:56:52,255
When I hear the 9th, I get, like...

1407
01:56:52,422 --> 01:56:54,090
...this funny feeling.

1408
01:56:55,091 --> 01:56:59,471
And then all I can think about
is, like, trying to snuff it.

1409
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:04,100
- I beg your pardon?
- Snuff it, sir. Death, I mean, missis.

1410
01:57:04,309 --> 01:57:06,937
I just want to die peacefully...

1411
01:57:07,354 --> 01:57:09,689
...like, with no pain.

1412
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:12,359
Do you feel that way now?

1413
01:57:13,527 --> 01:57:15,487
No, sir, not exactly.

1414
01:57:15,695 --> 01:57:16,988
I still feel...

1415
01:57:17,197 --> 01:57:18,532
...very miserable.

1416
01:57:18,740 --> 01:57:21,284
Very much down in spirits.

1417
01:57:21,785 --> 01:57:23,119
Do you still feel...

1418
01:57:23,328 --> 01:57:24,871
...suicidal?

1419
01:57:28,124 --> 01:57:29,876
Well, put it this way:

1420
01:57:30,168 --> 01:57:33,004
I feel very low in meself.

1421
01:57:33,797 --> 01:57:36,216
I can't see much in the future.

1422
01:57:36,424 --> 01:57:40,845
And I feel that any second, something
terrible is gonna happen to me.

1423
01:57:54,109 --> 01:57:55,735
Well done, Frank.

1424
01:58:00,657 --> 01:58:03,827
Julian, get the car,
would you, please?

1425
01:58:24,347 --> 01:58:25,849
<i>I woke up.</i>

1426
01:58:31,146 --> 01:58:34,941
<i>The pain and sickness
all over me like an animal.</i>

1427
01:58:42,991 --> 01:58:45,785
<i>Then I realized what it was.</i>

1428
01:58:47,120 --> 01:58:49,873
<i>The music coming up
from the floor...</i>

1429
01:58:50,081 --> 01:58:53,335
<i>...was our old friend
Ludwig van...</i>

1430
01:58:53,543 --> 01:58:56,212
<i>...and the dreaded 9th Symphony.</i>

1431
01:59:04,179 --> 01:59:05,555
Let me out!

1432
01:59:05,722 --> 01:59:07,557
Open the door!

1433
01:59:08,224 --> 01:59:10,393
Come on, open the door!

1434
01:59:12,937 --> 01:59:14,272
Turn it off!

1435
01:59:14,481 --> 01:59:16,232
Turn it off!

1436
01:59:17,233 --> 01:59:18,818
Turn it off!

1437
01:59:19,027 --> 01:59:20,737
Turn it off!

1438
01:59:20,945 --> 01:59:22,739
Turn it off!

1439
01:59:23,073 --> 01:59:24,074
Stop it!

1440
01:59:24,866 --> 01:59:26,993
Turn it off!

1441
01:59:32,582 --> 01:59:34,751
Turn it off!

1442
01:59:40,423 --> 01:59:42,467
Turn it off!

1443
01:59:44,344 --> 01:59:46,638
Turn it off!

1444
01:59:52,852 --> 01:59:54,604
Turn it off!

1445
02:00:06,616 --> 02:00:08,576
Turn it off!

1446
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:13,915
Turn it off!

1447
02:00:15,291 --> 02:00:16,292
Please!

1448
02:00:16,501 --> 02:00:18,628
Turn it off!

1449
02:00:32,517 --> 02:00:35,478
<i>Suddenly I viddied
what I had to do...</i>

1450
02:00:35,729 --> 02:00:38,106
<i>...and what I had wanted to do.</i>

1451
02:00:38,481 --> 02:00:40,942
<i>And that was to do myself in.</i>

1452
02:00:41,359 --> 02:00:42,694
<i>To snuff it.</i>

1453
02:00:42,986 --> 02:00:46,448
<i>To blast off forever
out of this wicked, cruel world.</i>

1454
02:00:47,907 --> 02:00:50,452
<i>One moment of pain perhaps...</i>

1455
02:00:50,744 --> 02:00:52,579
<i>...and then sleep.</i>

1456
02:00:52,787 --> 02:00:55,331
<i>Forever and ever...</i>

1457
02:00:55,498 --> 02:00:56,833
<i>...and ever.</i>

1458
02:01:21,316 --> 02:01:23,109
<i>I jumped,</i> O <i>my brothers...</i>

1459
02:01:23,318 --> 02:01:24,861
<i>...and I fell hard.</i>

1460
02:01:25,028 --> 02:01:27,322
<i>But I did not snuff it.</i>

1461
02:01:27,989 --> 02:01:29,532
<i>If I had snuffed it...</i>

1462
02:01:29,741 --> 02:01:33,036
<i>...I would not be here
to tell what I told have.</i>

1463
02:01:34,996 --> 02:01:39,667
<i>I came back to life
after a long, black, black gap...</i>

1464
02:01:39,876 --> 02:01:43,213
<i>...of what might have been
a million years.</i>

1465
02:02:11,908 --> 02:02:14,452
He's recovered
consciousness, doctor.

1466
02:02:54,450 --> 02:02:55,994
Hello, lad.

1467
02:02:56,202 --> 02:02:57,829
Hello, son.

1468
02:02:58,788 --> 02:03:00,206
How are you?

1469
02:03:01,374 --> 02:03:03,334
Are you feeling better?

1470
02:03:07,797 --> 02:03:09,299
What gives...

1471
02:03:09,465 --> 02:03:13,636
...O my Pee and Em?

1472
02:03:14,637 --> 02:03:16,139
What makes...

1473
02:03:16,890 --> 02:03:17,891
...you think...

1474
02:03:18,099 --> 02:03:20,602
...you are welcome?

1475
02:03:23,479 --> 02:03:25,481
There, there, Mother.
It's all right.

1476
02:03:25,690 --> 02:03:27,358
He doesn't mean it.

1477
02:03:29,777 --> 02:03:32,363
You were in the papers again, son.

1478
02:03:33,156 --> 02:03:34,741
It said...

1479
02:03:34,949 --> 02:03:37,660
...they had done
great wrong to you.

1480
02:03:38,578 --> 02:03:39,913
It said...

1481
02:03:40,121 --> 02:03:41,539
...how the government...

1482
02:03:41,748 --> 02:03:43,791
...drove you to try...

1483
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,585
...and do yourself in.

1484
02:03:47,337 --> 02:03:49,672
And when you think about it, son...

1485
02:03:50,757 --> 02:03:53,343
...maybe it was our fault too...

1486
02:03:53,718 --> 02:03:55,011
...in a way.

1487
02:03:56,137 --> 02:03:58,014
Your home's your home...

1488
02:03:58,389 --> 02:04:00,850
...when all's said and done, son.

1489
02:04:10,860 --> 02:04:13,404
- Good morning.
- Good morning, doctor.

1490
02:04:20,536 --> 02:04:22,246
- Good morning.
- Good morning, missis.

1491
02:04:22,413 --> 02:04:24,624
- How are you feeling today?
- Fine. Fine.

1492
02:04:24,832 --> 02:04:25,959
Good. May I?

1493
02:04:26,376 --> 02:04:28,503
- I'm Dr. Taylor.
- Haven't seen you before.

1494
02:04:28,711 --> 02:04:30,046
I'm your psychiatrist.

1495
02:04:30,213 --> 02:04:32,173
Psychiatrist! Do I need one?

1496
02:04:32,382 --> 02:04:34,008
Just part of hospital routine.

1497
02:04:34,217 --> 02:04:36,344
Are we going to
talk about me sex life?

1498
02:04:37,011 --> 02:04:40,098
No. I'm going to show you
some slides...

1499
02:04:40,306 --> 02:04:42,934
...and you're going to tell me
what you think about them.

1500
02:04:43,101 --> 02:04:44,978
- All right?
- Oh, jolly good.

1501
02:04:47,063 --> 02:04:48,690
You know anything about dreams?

1502
02:04:49,107 --> 02:04:50,274
Something, yes.

1503
02:04:50,483 --> 02:04:52,276
- You know what they mean?
- Perhaps.

1504
02:04:52,485 --> 02:04:53,903
You concerned about something?

1505
02:04:54,195 --> 02:04:57,198
No, no, not concerned, really...

1506
02:04:57,407 --> 02:04:59,492
...but I've been having
this nasty dream.

1507
02:04:59,701 --> 02:05:01,160
Very nasty.

1508
02:05:01,411 --> 02:05:03,246
It's like...

1509
02:05:03,705 --> 02:05:07,542
...well, when I was all smashed up,
you know...

1510
02:05:07,750 --> 02:05:09,794
...and half-awake
and unconscious-like...

1511
02:05:10,003 --> 02:05:12,213
...I kept having this dream.

1512
02:05:12,422 --> 02:05:15,341
All these doctors were
playing around with me gulliver.

1513
02:05:15,550 --> 02:05:17,635
You know, like the inside
of me brain.

1514
02:05:17,844 --> 02:05:20,763
I seem to have this dream
over and over again.

1515
02:05:20,930 --> 02:05:23,099
Do you think it means anything?

1516
02:05:24,058 --> 02:05:28,479
Patients who've sustained the injuries
you have often have dreams of this sort.

1517
02:05:28,688 --> 02:05:30,773
It's all part
of the recovery process.

1518
02:05:32,066 --> 02:05:34,902
Now then, each of these slides
needs a reply...

1519
02:05:35,111 --> 02:05:37,113
...from one of the people
in the picture.

1520
02:05:37,321 --> 02:05:40,616
You tell me what you think
the person would say.

1521
02:05:40,783 --> 02:05:43,327
- All right?
- Righty-right.

1522
02:05:45,288 --> 02:05:47,749
"Isn't the plumage beautiful?"

1523
02:05:48,875 --> 02:05:51,419
- I just say what the other person would say?
- Yes.

1524
02:05:51,586 --> 02:05:54,756
"Isn't the plumage beautiful?"

1525
02:05:55,506 --> 02:05:57,091
Don't think about it too long.

1526
02:05:57,300 --> 02:05:59,802
Just say the first thing
that pops into your mind.

1527
02:06:02,472 --> 02:06:04,849
Cabbages. Knickers.

1528
02:06:05,975 --> 02:06:08,311
It's not got a beak.

1529
02:06:08,519 --> 02:06:09,812
Good.

1530
02:06:13,483 --> 02:06:17,403
"The boy you always quarreled with
is seriously ill."

1531
02:06:18,321 --> 02:06:20,156
My mind is a blank.

1532
02:06:21,199 --> 02:06:25,161
And I'll smash your face
for you, yarblockos.

1533
02:06:25,328 --> 02:06:26,370
Good.

1534
02:06:28,956 --> 02:06:31,000
"What do you want?"

1535
02:06:32,168 --> 02:06:35,546
No time for the old in-out, love.
I've just come to read the meter.

1536
02:06:35,922 --> 02:06:37,256
Good.

1537
02:06:40,718 --> 02:06:44,263
"You sold me a crummy watch.
I want my money back."

1538
02:06:44,680 --> 02:06:47,683
You know what you can do with
that watch? Stick it up your ass!

1539
02:06:47,850 --> 02:06:49,352
Good.

1540
02:06:52,355 --> 02:06:55,024
"You can do whatever
you like with these."

1541
02:06:56,651 --> 02:06:58,402
Eggiwegs.

1542
02:06:58,903 --> 02:07:00,905
I would like...

1543
02:07:01,114 --> 02:07:02,448
...to smash them.

1544
02:07:03,199 --> 02:07:04,575
And pick them all up...

1545
02:07:04,784 --> 02:07:06,410
...and throw--

1546
02:07:06,619 --> 02:07:08,121
Fucking hell!

1547
02:07:08,996 --> 02:07:11,332
There. That's all there is to it.

1548
02:07:11,958 --> 02:07:13,459
Are you all right?

1549
02:07:14,335 --> 02:07:15,670
Hope so.

1550
02:07:15,878 --> 02:07:17,338
- Is that the end, then?
- Yes.

1551
02:07:17,505 --> 02:07:18,965
I was quite enjoying that.

1552
02:07:19,132 --> 02:07:20,591
Well, good. I'm glad.

1553
02:07:20,758 --> 02:07:22,009
How many did I get right?

1554
02:07:22,218 --> 02:07:24,053
It's not that kind of a test.

1555
02:07:24,262 --> 02:07:27,640
But you seem well on the way
to making a complete recovery.

1556
02:07:28,224 --> 02:07:32,478
- When do I get out of here, then?
- I'm sure it won't be long now.

1557
02:07:33,896 --> 02:07:35,565
<i>So I waited.</i>

1558
02:07:35,731 --> 02:07:37,400
<i>And, O my brothers...</i>

1559
02:07:37,567 --> 02:07:39,068
<i>...I got a lot better...</i>

1560
02:07:39,277 --> 02:07:42,572
<i>...munching away at eggiwegs
and lomticks of toast...</i>

1561
02:07:42,780 --> 02:07:45,241
<i>...and lovely steakie-wakes.</i>

1562
02:07:45,449 --> 02:07:46,951
<i>And</i> then one day...

1563
02:07:47,160 --> 02:07:51,330
<i>...they said I was going to have
a very special visitor.</i>

1564
02:07:56,752 --> 02:08:00,089
- Wait outside for a moment, would you?
- Yes, sir.

1565
02:08:02,592 --> 02:08:04,802
I'm afraid my change of schedule
has thrown you.

1566
02:08:05,011 --> 02:08:07,305
The patient's in the middle
of supper.

1567
02:08:07,513 --> 02:08:10,391
That's quite all right, minister.
No trouble at all.

1568
02:08:11,934 --> 02:08:14,937
- Good evening, my boy.
- Hi there, my little droogies.

1569
02:08:15,146 --> 02:08:16,981
How're you getting on, young man?

1570
02:08:17,315 --> 02:08:19,609
Great, sir. Just great.

1571
02:08:20,318 --> 02:08:21,903
Can I do anything more for you?

1572
02:08:22,069 --> 02:08:23,946
I don't think so, Sir Leslie.
Thank you.

1573
02:08:24,155 --> 02:08:26,782
Then I leave you to it. Nurse.

1574
02:08:29,619 --> 02:08:32,914
Well, you seem to have a whole ward
to yourself, my boy.

1575
02:08:33,206 --> 02:08:34,457
Yes, sir.

1576
02:08:35,041 --> 02:08:37,335
And a very lonely place
it is too, sir...

1577
02:08:37,543 --> 02:08:39,962
...when I wake up in the night
with me pain.

1578
02:08:40,296 --> 02:08:43,758
Yes. Well, anyway, good to see you
on the mend.

1579
02:08:43,966 --> 02:08:46,552
I kept in constant touch
with the hospital, of course.

1580
02:08:46,761 --> 02:08:48,638
And now I've come down personally...

1581
02:08:48,804 --> 02:08:50,473
...to see how you're getting along.

1582
02:08:50,848 --> 02:08:53,184
I've suffered the tortures
of the damned, sir.

1583
02:08:53,392 --> 02:08:54,977
Tortures of the damned.

1584
02:08:55,144 --> 02:08:58,272
Yes, I can appreciate that
you have had an extremely dis--

1585
02:08:58,481 --> 02:09:01,192
Oh, look. Let me help you
with that, shall I?

1586
02:09:01,359 --> 02:09:03,194
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1587
02:09:03,361 --> 02:09:07,698
I can tell you with all sincerity that I, and
the government of which I'm a member...

1588
02:09:07,907 --> 02:09:11,869
...are deeply sorry about this,
my boy. Deeply sorry.

1589
02:09:12,078 --> 02:09:13,329
We tried to help you.

1590
02:09:13,537 --> 02:09:17,667
We followed recommendations which were
made to us that turned out to be wrong.

1591
02:09:18,042 --> 02:09:21,879
An inquiry will place the
responsibility where it belongs.

1592
02:09:22,630 --> 02:09:25,841
We want you to regard us
as friends.

1593
02:09:26,008 --> 02:09:27,218
We put you right.

1594
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:29,679
You're getting
the best of treatment.

1595
02:09:29,845 --> 02:09:32,139
We never wished you harm.

1596
02:09:32,390 --> 02:09:35,059
But there are some who did, and do.

1597
02:09:35,518 --> 02:09:38,271
And I think you know who those are.

1598
02:09:38,688 --> 02:09:42,650
There are certain people who wanted
to use you for political ends.

1599
02:09:42,858 --> 02:09:45,278
They would have been
glad to have you dead...

1600
02:09:45,486 --> 02:09:48,656
...for they thought they could then
blame it all on the government.

1601
02:09:49,198 --> 02:09:51,575
There is also a certain man...

1602
02:09:51,784 --> 02:09:54,328
...a writer of subversive literature...

1603
02:09:54,537 --> 02:09:56,706
...who has been howling
for your blood.

1604
02:09:56,872 --> 02:10:00,042
He's been mad with desire
to stick a knife into you.

1605
02:10:00,209 --> 02:10:02,295
But you're safe from him now.

1606
02:10:02,503 --> 02:10:04,547
We put him away.

1607
02:10:06,507 --> 02:10:09,552
He found out that you
had done wrong to him.

1608
02:10:10,052 --> 02:10:12,596
At least he believed
you had done wrong.

1609
02:10:12,805 --> 02:10:17,059
He formed this idea in his head
that you had been responsible...

1610
02:10:17,226 --> 02:10:20,730
...for the death of someone
near and dear to him.

1611
02:10:21,564 --> 02:10:22,732
He was a menace.

1612
02:10:22,898 --> 02:10:25,067
We put him away
for his own protection.

1613
02:10:25,276 --> 02:10:26,569
And also for yours.

1614
02:10:27,403 --> 02:10:28,821
Where is he now, sir?

1615
02:10:29,030 --> 02:10:32,533
We put him away
where he can do you no harm.

1616
02:10:32,742 --> 02:10:35,870
You see, we are looking
after your interests.

1617
02:10:36,078 --> 02:10:38,122
We are interested in you.

1618
02:10:38,414 --> 02:10:41,959
And when you leave, you'll have no
worries. We'll see to everything.

1619
02:10:42,168 --> 02:10:44,337
A good job on a good salary.

1620
02:10:44,545 --> 02:10:46,255
What job and how much?

1621
02:10:47,173 --> 02:10:51,177
You must have an interesting job at
a salary you'd regard as adequate.

1622
02:10:51,385 --> 02:10:53,596
Not only for the job
you're going to do...

1623
02:10:53,763 --> 02:10:57,475
...and in compensation for what
you believe you have suffered...

1624
02:10:57,683 --> 02:11:01,354
...but also because
you are helping us.

1625
02:11:02,605 --> 02:11:04,106
Helping you, sir?

1626
02:11:04,398 --> 02:11:07,526
We always help our friends,
don't we?

1627
02:11:13,949 --> 02:11:16,243
It is no secret
that this government...

1628
02:11:16,452 --> 02:11:19,622
...has lost a lot of popularity
because of you, my boy.

1629
02:11:19,789 --> 02:11:23,292
There are some who think that at
the next election we shall be out.

1630
02:11:23,459 --> 02:11:26,170
The press has chosen to take
a very unfavorable view...

1631
02:11:26,379 --> 02:11:27,963
...of what we tried to do.

1632
02:11:28,839 --> 02:11:32,134
But public opinion
has a way of changing.

1633
02:11:32,343 --> 02:11:34,136
And you, Alex--

1634
02:11:34,303 --> 02:11:36,222
If I may call you Alex.

1635
02:11:36,430 --> 02:11:39,725
Certainly, sir.
What do they call you at home?

1636
02:11:41,060 --> 02:11:42,353
My name is Frederick.

1637
02:11:43,312 --> 02:11:45,189
As I was saying, Alex...

1638
02:11:45,398 --> 02:11:50,277
...you can be instrumental
in changing the public's verdict.

1639
02:11:53,531 --> 02:11:55,574
Do you understand, Alex?

1640
02:11:56,492 --> 02:11:58,661
Do I make myself clear?

1641
02:12:01,622 --> 02:12:03,958
As an unmuddied lake, Fred.

1642
02:12:04,458 --> 02:12:07,878
As clear as an azure sky
of deepest summer.

1643
02:12:08,087 --> 02:12:09,505
You can rely on me, Fred.

1644
02:12:09,713 --> 02:12:11,173
Good.

1645
02:12:11,340 --> 02:12:12,800
Good boy.

1646
02:12:12,967 --> 02:12:15,719
Oh, yes.
I understand you're fond of music.

1647
02:12:15,928 --> 02:12:18,180
I have arranged a little
surprise for you.

1648
02:12:18,514 --> 02:12:19,932
Surprise?

1649
02:12:20,141 --> 02:12:21,934
One that I hope
that you will like...

1650
02:12:22,143 --> 02:12:23,519
".888...

1651
02:12:24,311 --> 02:12:25,729
How shall we put it?

1652
02:12:25,938 --> 02:12:29,191
As a symbol of
our new understanding.

1653
02:12:30,067 --> 02:12:33,487
An understanding
between two friends.

1654
02:13:53,484 --> 02:13:56,111
<i>I was cured, all right.</i>
