1
00:02:40,553 --> 00:02:43,554
-你好  -鸡汤面条Campbell来了
-Hey, what's up? -Hey, it's Chicken-Noodle Campbell.

2
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,181
你不是应该坐在高脚椅子上吗
Shouldn't you be sittin' in a high chair?

3
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:46,510
法医的报告
Coroner's report.

4
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,427
你一直抽烟还不如直接吸毒呢
Why don't you just try crack?

5
00:02:48,518 --> 00:02:49,929
你觉得自己这样很幽默吗
You call that humor?

6
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,392
长官说别再打976了 
The Captain says no more 976 calls.

7
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,742
念珠先生 你得到其他地方寻找更高的启示
Mr. Love Beads, you'll have to seek higher enlightenment somewhere else.

8
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:11,987
我是中尉Cole 负责处理这件案子
I'm Lieutenant Cole. Been assigned to the case.

9
00:03:12,081 --> 00:03:13,492
他们要求我来看看这份文件 
They asked me to come and look at the file.

10
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,741
我并不想这样失礼 很高兴见到你 
Didn't mean to be discourteous. Nice to meet you.

11
00:03:15,835 --> 00:03:18,207
我听说过你 但没想到会这么快遇到你 
I heard about you. I wasn't expecting you so soon.

12
00:03:18,295 --> 00:03:21,165
-你在纽约工作 DeMarco谋杀案  -是的
-You worked in New York, right? DeMarco killings? -Yes,sir.

13
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,174
这里不是纽约 这也不是DeMarco谋杀案 
This ain't New York and this ain't the DeMarco killings.

14
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:26,251
我们是讲究合作的 
We work as a team around here.

15
00:03:26,636 --> 00:03:30,336
我只想破这个案子 
You know, the way I work is I just like to solve the case.

16
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:32,589
我甚至不在乎功劳归谁
I don't even care who gets the credit.

17
00:03:32,683 --> 00:03:34,722
说得好 就这样 
Beautiful. That's that.

18
00:03:35,602 --> 00:03:37,013
我们叫这家伙"居家男人"
We call this guy, "The Family Man".

19
00:03:37,104 --> 00:03:39,725
过去八个月他杀了六个家庭
He's killed six families in the last eight months.

20
00:03:39,814 --> 00:03:41,095
都是仪式杀人
All ritual killings.

21
00:03:41,191 --> 00:03:44,227
你发现受害人间有什么联系吗 
Have you found any connection between the victims at all?

22
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,726
除了他们全部是天主教徒   
Other than the fact that they're all Catholic which ties 

23
00:03:46,821 --> 00:03:49,027
以十字架的形式被钉死外 就没了 
into the crucifixion ritual, no.

24
00:03:49,115 --> 00:03:51,190
Jim 刚刚又发现两起 
Hei, Jim! They just found two more.

25
00:03:53,085 --> 00:03:56,404
最新的命案 今天是你的幸运日 我们走吧
Fresh kill. Today's your lucky day. Let's go.

26
00:04:21,393 --> 00:04:23,137
这不一样 Jim 
This ain't the same, Jim.

27
00:04:24,188 --> 00:04:26,560
是的 这是第一次在汽车旅馆中发生
Yeah, this is the first one in a motel.

28
00:04:27,024 --> 00:04:29,514
其余的都是在受害者家中
All the rest have taken place in their houses.

29
00:04:29,609 --> 00:04:31,981
一般来说 我们能确认受害夫妇的身份 但是   
Normally, we can lD the couple, but...

30
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,190
除此之外 作案手法非常相似
other than that, it's pretty much the same MO.

31
00:04:39,535 --> 00:04:43,449
不 不仅仅如此 这次是完全不同的
No, there's a lot more than that goin' on. I mean, this is different.

32
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,167
问一下...你结婚了吗 
So...Are you married or what?

33
00:04:50,253 --> 00:04:52,292
这是我为什么讨厌新搭档的原因
This is what I hate about new partners.

34
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,538
他们总是想知道别人的情况 
They always want to get personal.

35
00:04:55,382 --> 00:04:57,920
-我并不想谈论这个 好吗  -好吧
-I don't want to talk about it, all right? -Okay.

36
00:04:59,344 --> 00:05:02,013
-忘记我刚才说的  -很好
-Forget that I ever mentioned anything at all. -Good.

37
00:05:03,723 --> 00:05:05,466
你结婚了吗 
Are you married, or what?

38
00:05:06,642 --> 00:05:08,136
没 没结婚 
No, I'm not married.

39
00:05:08,436 --> 00:05:11,721
我知道的每个已婚警官 都有一个不想和他睡觉的妻子   
Every cop I know who's married, has a wife who won't sleep with him...

40
00:05:11,814 --> 00:05:13,012
两个不听他话的小孩   
two kids who don't listen to him...

41
00:05:13,107 --> 00:05:15,644
和一条宁可舔自己也不愿去取报纸的狗 
and a dog that'd rather lick himself than fetch the paper.

42
00:05:15,734 --> 00:05:18,521
所有单位速到圣埃德蒙学校
All units respond to a barricaded suspect with hostages...

43
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:20,070
一持枪嫌犯挟持了人质   
at the Saint Edmund's School.

44
00:05:20,155 --> 00:05:22,824
-可能是自杀  -收到 我们马上到
-Possible suicide. -Yeah, we're in that area.

45
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:25,867
-你在干什么  -就在这附近啊
-Hey, what are you doin'? -It's right over here.

46
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,407
不 那是自杀 而我们是凶杀组 
No, man. That's suicide. We're Homicide.

47
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,366
如果有傻瓜想要跳楼 那是他自己的问题 
If some dumb ass wants to jump off a buildin', that's his problem.

48
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,947
如果有人把他推下楼的话 再来找我 
Somebody pushes his ass off a buildin', then call me.

49
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,746
我的看法是 死亡都一样  
The way I look at it, death is death.

50
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,375
我们必须对死者抱有同情心 还有快死的   
We gotta have compassion for the dead, the dying...

51
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,586
可能快死的 快要死的
the could-be-dying and the about-to-be-dead.

52
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,674 
我去 我去 行了吧 
I'm going. I'm going.

53
00:06:05,987 --> 00:06:08,193
快快快
Faster, come on. Quickly, quickly.

54
00:06:09,782 --> 00:06:11,989
侦探Cole 侦探Campbell 什么情况 
Detective Cole. Detective Campbell. What have we got?

55
00:06:12,076 --> 00:06:13,985
一个叫Johnny Deverell的男孩 他是高年级的
A boy named Johnny Deverell. He's a senior.

56
00:06:14,078 --> 00:06:16,070
他拿了一把枪 在一个全是小孩的教室里 
He's got a gun and a class full of kids.

57
00:06:16,163 --> 00:06:17,242

That's nice.

58
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:19,288
-他想要干什么  -我不知道 
-What does he want? -I don't know.

他的女朋友和他分手了 他女朋友也在里面 
His girlfriend broke up with him. He's got her up there too.

60
00:06:23,211 --> 00:06:24,835
他以前还惹过什么别的麻烦吗
Has he been in trouble before?

61
00:06:24,921 --> 00:06:27,756
他曾因毒品而被捕 他们让他看过医生 
He was arrested for drugs. They had him seeing a therapist.

62
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,331
是啊 一定是没找对医生 
Yeah, must have been the wrong therapist.

63
00:06:30,551 --> 00:06:33,172
让每个人保持安静 把每个人都带离现场
Keep everybody quiet. Keep everybody back.

64
00:06:35,555 --> 00:06:37,631
你知道这不关我们的事 
Man, you know this ain't our gig.

65
00:06:37,724 --> 00:06:39,218
这就是一个陷入苦恋的小孩 
Look, it's a love-sick kid.

66
00:06:39,309 --> 00:06:42,060
持枪的陷入苦恋的小孩 国家为什么培训特种部队
A well-armed, love-sick kid. Why do you think they got SWAT?

67
00:06:42,145 --> 00:06:43,853
因为穿一身黑看起来很帅
'Cause they look good in black.

68
00:06:43,938 --> 00:06:47,686
尽量给我找几部移动电话
See if you can get me a couple of cell phones right away.

69
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:52,820
Johnny 停下 他们会伤害你的
Johnny, please stop it. They're gonna hurt you.

70
00:06:52,988 --> 00:06:56,403
闭嘴 Millie 我现在没心情想这个 
Shut your mouth, Millie! I'm not in the mood for this!

71
00:06:56,574 --> 00:06:57,605
放下枪 Johnny
Put the gun down, Johnny.

72
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,859
-放下  -闭嘴 
-Just put it down! -Shut up!

73

我不是来伤害你的 我是来帮助你的
I'm not here to hurt you. I'm here to help you.

76
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,333
我必须和你谈谈
I gotta get into a dialogue with you...

77
00:07:15,425 --> 00:07:19,588
在那些穿黑衣服的家伙到这前 因为他们不听任何人的话 
before the guys in black get here, 'cause they don't listen to anybody.

78
00:07:20,554 --> 00:07:22,511
我不想你受到伤害 
I don't want you to get hurt.

79

You'll see that I'm unarmed.

81
00:07:32,815 --> 00:07:34,274

Nobody move!

82
00:07:36,152 --> 00:07:39,734
过来 走到窗户这 看着我 
Come on over. Step over to the window and look at me.

86
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,499

00:07:56,628 --> 00:07:58,003
你怎么了
What are you on?

88
00:07:58,213 --> 00:07:59,837
少跟我套近乎 
Don't talk to me like you know me!

89

93
00:08:17,981 --> 00:08:19,688
到底是有什么问题
Now, what's the problem?

94
00:08:19,857 --> 00:08:21,649
你不了解 
You don't understand, man.

95
00:08:22,151 --> 00:08:24,903
你不了解 我不能和他回去

你不了解 我不能和他回去 
You don't understand. I can't go back with him.

你看 特种部队肯定会杀了这个男孩
Now, you see? SWAT would have killed this boy.

108

你知道 我也知道

109
00:09:04,397 --> 00:09:06,805
-你不是自由作家  -不是

111
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,855

No shit.

Frank Deverell 怪不得
Frank Deverell. It figures.

113
00:09:20,412 --> 00:09:22,488
富人的小孩都是混蛋 
Rich people's kids are always fucked up.

114
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,786
中尉 哪里能找到侦探Cole

118
00:09:34,591 --> 00:09:37,378
阻止了我继子自杀
for not letting my stepson take his own life.

119

侦探Cole 我能和你谈一下吗

我现在很忙 
I'm kind of busy right now.

128
00:10:14,585 --> 00:10:18,036
就几句 Deverell先生让我
I'll be very brief. Mr. Deverell asked me to speak to you...

129
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,206
代表他继子跟你谈谈   
on behalf of his stepson.

130
00:10:20,632 --> 00:10:21,628
关于什么 
About what?

131
00:10:21,717 --> 00:10:24,552
Deverell先生感觉你的证言会非常有帮助   
Mr. Deverell feels your testimony would be very helpful...

132
00:10:24,636 --> 00:10:27,839
在争取Johnny因暂时精神不正常被判无罪时
in getting Johnny acquitted on grounds of temporary insanity.

133
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:31,264
有个小问题 首先 我不认为他精神不正常 
There's a little problem. First of all, I don't think he's insane.

134
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,636
第二 我喜欢实话实话
Second of all, I like to testify as to what actually happened.

135

Johnny在经历一段非常困难的时期
Johnny's been going through a very difficult time.

137
00:10:41,776 --> 00:10:45,048
他需要治疗 而不是监禁
He needs treatment, not prison.

138
00:10:46,406 --> 00:10:48,564
你可能也知道 Deverell先生 
Now, Mr. Deverell, as you may know...

139
00:10:48,658 --> 00:10:52,525
是个非常重要的人 非常有影响力
he's a very important man, and a man with a lot of influence...

140
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:55,241
他可以成就或摧毁一个人的事业 
a man who could help or hurt a career.

141
00:10:57,374 --> 00:10:59,911
你是为这个男人做什么的
Just what is it that you do for this man?

142
00:11:00,543 --> 00:11:03,081
我是负责Deverell先生的安全的 
I'm in charge of Mr. Deverell's security.

143
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,382
差点把我搞糊涂了 我以为你是一位律师 听着 
Could have fooled me. I thought you were an attorney.Listen...

144
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,589
请帮我带个话 
I want you to deliver a message for me.

145
00:11:09,676 --> 00:11:13,590
告诉你的混蛋老板 没有人 没有人能威胁我
You tell your asshole boss that nobody, nobody threatens me.

146
00:11:15,598 --> 00:11:19,049
了解了 我会把你的感受告诉Deverell先生 
I understand. I'll convey your feelings to Mr. Deverell.

147
00:11:19,185 --> 00:11:22,719
现在给我滚出去 别再出现在我面前 
Now get your ugly, white ass out of here. And don't come back.

148
00:11:30,153 --> 00:11:31,861
汽车旅馆受害人有一些问题   
The motel victim had some problems...

149
00:11:31,946 --> 00:11:34,105
你可能想要知道 
l thought you might want to know about.

150
00:11:34,198 --> 00:11:36,820
除了头部中枪 被钉十字架吗
Besides bein' shot in the head and crucified?

151
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:38,948
你要告诉我什么 她经历了不如意的一天吗
What are you gonna tell me, she had a bad-hair day?

152
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:41,788
她本来也就可能会在几个月内死亡
She would have been dead in a couple of months.

153
00:11:42,456 --> 00:11:43,570
为什么 
From what?

154
00:11:44,124 --> 00:11:47,789
我发现了晚期骨肉瘤 和间质性纤维化
I found advanced osteosarcoma and interstitial fibrosis.

155
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:52,294
如果你不用英语说 我会用字典打死你
If you don't say it in English, I'll beat you to death with a dictionary.

156
00:11:52,381 --> 00:11:56,544
是一种罕见的骨癌 而且扩散到全身了
It's a rare form of bone cancer, and this cancer had spread throughout her body.

157
00:11:56,635 --> 00:11:59,091
-什么引起的  -我是什么 先知吗
-What'd cause that? -What am I? The Amazing Randy?

158
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:01,670
我们得测试 会花点时间 
We have tests to run, it will take time.

159
00:12:02,015 --> 00:12:03,806
指纹方面有什么发现吗
What'd you come up with on prints?

160
00:12:03,892 --> 00:12:06,513
没有 我认为她不是本地人 
Nothing. I don't think she's local.

161
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:09,848
我也这么认为 我甚至认为她不是美国人
Neither do I. I don't even think she's American.

162
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:11,855
我认为她是俄国人
I think she's Russian.

163
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:15,026
等等 我以为他才是先知呢
Wait, I thought he was the Amazing Randy.

164
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:17,020
头发 颊骨    
Hair...cheekbones...

165
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:22,449
遗传骨骼结构 我认为她是俄国人 很有可能是格鲁吉亚人 
genetic bone structure. I think she's Russian, most likely Georgian.

166
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,578
你就这么看她一眼就得出这些结论
You can tell all that just by lookin' at her?

167
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,236
是啊 她是水瓶座的 喜欢乡村音乐
Right. She's an Aquarius and likes country music.

168
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,742
曾经是水瓶座
Was...an Aquarian.

169
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,241
精神已经离开了身体 
You see, the spirit has left the body.

170
00:12:33,418 --> 00:12:36,335
摆在这儿的 只是一个破碎的容器 
What we have here is a mere broken vessel.

171
00:12:38,506 --> 00:12:39,336
"一个破碎的容器"
"A broken vessel?"

172
00:12:39,424 --> 00:12:43,635
关于这具躯体 你还有什么想要评价的
Anything else interesting about the body that you'd like to comment on or...

173
00:12:46,513 --> 00:12:48,055
她的胸很好看
She's got nice tits.

174
00:12:48,265 --> 00:12:51,182
完全正确 但是有点太好看了 
Precisely, Grasshopper, but a little bit too nice.

175
00:13:02,736 --> 00:13:04,775
好了 伙计 查查这个序列号
Okay, partner, run this number.

176
00:13:11,619 --> 00:13:14,288
侦探Cole不想合作 
Detective Cole's not gonna cooperate.

177
00:13:15,164 --> 00:13:17,287
这是新手常有的毛病啊
That's the problem with new cops.

178
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:20,620
应当教教他们应该听谁的
They need to be taught who to pay attention to.

179
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,542
我很高兴给他上这一课 
I'd be happy to teach him that lesson.

180
00:13:28,134 --> 00:13:30,459
让我们的俄国朋友对付他
Put some of our Russian friends on it.

181
00:13:30,678 --> 00:13:33,085
这次变变 让他们自己努力挣钱吧
Let them earn their money for a change.

182
00:13:36,975 --> 00:13:38,968
其它事情还正常吗
Everything else in shape?

183
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,300
一切正常 
Like clockwork.

184
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,433
所有人都还毫无知情吗 
Everyone's still in the dark?

185
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:47,602
紧锁消息 只要每个人都闭上他们的嘴
It's a very tight seal, as long as everyone keeps their mouth shut.

186
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,975
他们会的
They will.

187
00:13:50,821 --> 00:13:53,228
我们已经给他们树了一个好榜样
I think we've set a very good example.

188
00:14:08,045 --> 00:14:11,994
为什么来洛杉矶 纽约的神经病对你来说不够多吗
So, why LA? New York didn't have enough psychopaths for you?

189
00:14:12,465 --> 00:14:14,541
我和我的上司相处得不好 
I didn't get along with my captain.

190
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:18,583
是改变的时候了 前妻把孩子们都带来这了 
Figured it was time for a change. The ex moved out here with the kids.

191
00:14:26,728 --> 00:14:28,886
你们继续聊...
Yeah. Y'all just go on....

192
00:14:33,693 --> 00:14:35,851
不 谢谢你 我不太认识你 
No, thank you, I don't know you that well.

193
00:14:35,945 --> 00:14:37,403
不 那是茶 好东西 
No, that's tea. That's good stuff.

194
00:14:37,488 --> 00:14:40,442
鹿角做的 可提升你的阳刚之气
It's deer antler. It's good for your masculinity.

195
00:14:40,532 --> 00:14:42,940
我没什么问题 多谢你的好意 
Ain't nothin' wrong with my manhood, thank you.

196
00:14:43,034 --> 00:14:45,027
让我喝一小口 
Let me just have a little sip.

197
00:14:46,496 --> 00:14:48,535
这是我最喜爱的电影 
This is my favorite movie.

198
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:56,870
你知道我是黑人吗 我完全不知道你在说什么
Do you know I'm black? I have no idea what you're saying.

199
00:14:57,339 --> 00:14:59,213
她说那部电影使她哭
She says that movie always makes her cry.

200
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:01,505
是 那是一部赚人眼泪的电影 
Yeah, that's a real tearjerker.

201
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:04,968
不是说我会看电影哭或什么的
Not that I cry at movies or anything like that.

202
00:15:06,597 --> 00:15:09,847
仅仅一个忧伤的场景可赚不到我的眼泪
It takes more than a sad scene to break me, you know what I mean?

203
00:15:09,934 --> 00:15:12,603
你应该偶尔哭一下 能使灵魂清洁 
Once in a while you should cry 'cause it cleanses the soul.

204
00:15:12,686 --> 00:15:14,346
你会需要的
You could use a little bit of that.

205
00:15:14,438 --> 00:15:17,557
如果我需要清洁 我有糠麸饼 多谢
If I need cleansing, I have a bran muffin. Thank you.

206
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:19,891
这里没有纸巾*
You ain't gonna find one here.

207
00:15:21,736 --> 00:15:22,482
该死
Shit.

208
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,776
我可能对这香味过敏 
I think I'm allergic to the incense.

209
00:15:28,409 --> 00:15:31,650
你们卖蟑螂 天哪 我选错行了
Y'all sell roaches? Damn, I'm in the wrong business.

210
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,994
我要是干这个 不用离开我的公寓就能赚钱 
I could make money and never leave my apartment.

211
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:38,457
把这个放到你舌头下面 
Just put this underneath your tongue.

212
00:15:38,543 --> 00:15:41,627
对过敏很有效 立刻就会让你恢复 
It's perfect for allergies. It'll clear you right up.

213
00:15:44,214 --> 00:15:45,495
有些苦 
This is bitter.

214
00:15:45,591 --> 00:15:47,168
苦吗 我不知道为什么它是苦的 
Bitter? I don't know why it'd be bitter.

215
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:48,504
这是什么 
What is this?

216
00:15:50,095 --> 00:15:53,179
只是一点鹿鞭粉 
It's just a little bit of powdered deer penis.

217
00:15:57,143 --> 00:16:01,721
真搞笑啊 你真幽默啊 太侮辱人了 
That's real funny. That's real fuckin' funny. Damn, do I feel violated.

218
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,154
告诉我 你这珠子到底怎么回事
So tell me, what's up with the beads?

219
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:17,859
这些吗 这叫玛拉 藏族祈祷用的珠子 
These here? It's called a mahla. Tibetan prayer beads.

220
00:16:18,495 --> 00:16:19,526
你用这些来干吗 
What do you use 'em for?

221
00:16:19,621 --> 00:16:22,990
我用它们使自己冷静 净化我的思想
I use them to calm my mind and to purify my thoughts.

222
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:25,910
我用威士忌
Yeah, I use Jack Daniel's.

223
00:16:26,002 --> 00:16:27,662
我们有同样的目的 
We're tryin' to go to the same place.

224
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,161
只是方法不同而已 
We're just using a different technique.

225
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,248
只是我不用把酒瓶子戴在脖子上
Except I don't wear the bottle around my neck.

226
00:16:32,341 --> 00:16:35,010
因为如果你那么做的话 会失去工作
That's because you'd lose your job if you did.

227
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:38,177
呼叫4K63 刚刚收到线人的电话
Roden to 4 King 63. Just got a call from an informant...

228
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,670
说有"居家男人"的消息 
who claims to have info on The Family Man.

229
00:16:40,765 --> 00:16:43,256
他说只把消息给你们 在南部码头等你们
Says he'll only give it to you. Waitin' on the south dock.

230
00:16:43,351 --> 00:16:45,676
4K63收到 我们马上去码头
This is 4 King 63. We're on our way.

231
00:16:55,613 --> 00:16:58,272
你看 他们闯进了那部车 
See? They're breakin' into a car over there.

232
00:16:58,364 --> 00:17:01,365
我们是来这里见线人的 没时间搭理他们
We're here to meet an informant. We don't have time for that.

233
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,609
我们是警察 就应该立刻抓坏蛋 
We're police. We gotta get the bad guys once in a while.

234
00:17:03,702 --> 00:17:06,240
干脆给你一双红靴子和斗篷...
Why don't we get you some red boots and a cape...

235
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:09,663
这样你就能绕着城市飞 阻止所有的犯罪 
and you can fly around the city and stop all the crime?

236
00:17:20,884 --> 00:17:22,213
警察 别动 
Police! Freeze!

237
00:17:23,512 --> 00:17:26,880
知道什么让我恼火吗 就是看到像你们一样的混蛋
You know what pisses me off? When I see some sorry-ass motherfuckers...

238
00:17:26,973 --> 00:17:28,633
头发比我多
like you with more hair than me.

239
00:17:28,725 --> 00:17:31,050
转过身 把手放到车上...
Turn around, put your goddamn hands on the car...

240
00:17:31,144 --> 00:17:33,516
别逼我发飙
before I go get my clippers and go crazy in here.

241
00:17:33,604 --> 00:17:34,979
去死 猪头
Fuck you, pig.

242
00:17:35,564 --> 00:17:37,770
"去死" 他说"去死"吗
"Fuck you?" Did he say, "Fuck you"?

243
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:41,024
我很迷惑 我们有徽章 我们有枪 
I'm confused. We got the badges. We got the guns.

244
00:17:41,445 --> 00:17:43,069
你们只有一把螺丝刀
You got a screwdriver.

245
00:17:43,321 --> 00:17:46,073
你们拿一把螺丝刀参加枪战吗
It's kind of like takin' a screwdriver to a gunfight.

246
00:17:46,157 --> 00:17:48,233
猪头 这可是旧词儿
And "pig," that's an old phrase.

247
00:17:48,326 --> 00:17:52,655
你们一定不是这里的人 你们一定是别的国家的
Y'all must not be from around here. Y'all must be from another country...

248
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,573
放下枪 拜托
Drop the guns. Please.

249
00:17:55,832 --> 00:17:58,916
这是警察办事 不关你们的事 
This is a police matter. It's got nothin' to do with you.

250
00:17:59,002 --> 00:18:00,496
放下枪 
Drop the guns.

251
00:18:03,339 --> 00:18:06,091
我们只能来硬的了
Think we're gonna have to do this the hard way.

252
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:08,461
我不能打架 
I can't fight, man.

253
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:12,419
"不能打架" 什么意思 这个时候正是告诉我的好时机啊
What do you mean you can't fight? It's a fine time to tell me now.

254
00:18:12,514 --> 00:18:14,471
跪下 马上
Get down on your knees. Now.

255
00:18:14,933 --> 00:18:17,139
他喜欢你 这是个好消息 
He likes you, that's the good news.

256
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:20,141
对不起 没有晚饭和电影我不会跪的
Sorry. Not without dinner and a movie.

257
00:18:27,069 --> 00:18:30,687
你朋友喜欢来硬的 你呢
Your friend likes to do things the hard way. Now, how about you?

258
00:18:30,864 --> 00:18:34,908
我的朋友 他喜欢乡村音乐 而我喜欢摇滚 
My friend, he's a little bit country, I'm a little bit rock-n'-roll.

259
00:18:34,993 --> 00:18:36,273
什么意思 
What does that mean?

260
00:18:36,369 --> 00:18:39,073
只是个表达 你要什么 
Just an expression. What do you want?

261
00:18:39,497 --> 00:18:40,907
要你死

00:30:30,676 --> 00:30:32,336
和别人有什么联系吗 
Any connection to the others?

398
00:30:32,428 --> 00:30:34,586
没有 他们甚至不是天主教徒 
No. They weren't even Catholic.

399
00:30:35,097 --> 00:30:37,422
另外还有什么 
There goes that theory. What's next?

400
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,602
这是空的 
This is empty.

401
00:30:41,936 --> 00:30:44,178
只是所有我们知道的关于你的东西 
It's everything we know about you.

402
00:30:44,272 --> 00:30:46,597
你毫无背景 除了烟雾和镜子 
Your background's nothin' but smoke and mirrors.

403
00:30:46,691 --> 00:30:47,604
你是谁 杰克 
Who are you, Jack?

404
00:30:47,692 --> 00:30:49,020
我现在没时间解释 
I can't get into it right now.

405
00:30:49,109 --> 00:30:50,901
也许你能解释 
Yeah, well maybe you can get into this.

406
00:30:50,986 --> 00:30:53,607
我们在你前妻的房子里 找到了你的指纹 
We found your print at your ex-wife's house.

407
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:58,407
她是我前妻  我一直去她那接我孩子 
She was my ex-wife. I pick up my kids there all the time.

408
00:30:58,493 --> 00:31:00,201
指纹是在尸体上的 
The print's on the body.

409
00:31:01,746 --> 00:31:02,944
移植上去的 
Planted.

410
00:31:03,122 --> 00:31:05,613
还有一阵烟雾 从那绿色小山飘过来 
And there's a puff of smoke comin' from the grassy knoll.

411
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:08,377
你到底 想干什么 
What kind of bullshit you tryin' to run, man?

412
00:31:09,378 --> 00:31:12,960
我不是一直当警察 这是我现在能告诉你的 
I ain't always been a cop. That's all I can tell you right now.

413
00:31:14,632 --> 00:31:17,253
你是个神秘人物 
You are one mysterious motherfucker.

414
00:31:18,553 --> 00:31:20,841
没人知道你的过去...
Nobody seems to know anything about your past...

415
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:23,930
...唯一的证据就和你有关 
and the only evidence I got points right at you.

416
00:31:24,016 --> 00:31:26,388
现在这让你担心了吗 杰克 
Now, does that worry you, Jack?

417
00:31:27,727 --> 00:31:29,186
我看起来担心吗 
Do I look worried?

418
00:31:29,604 --> 00:31:31,597
好的 这使我担心 
Well, it damn sure worries me.

419
00:31:54,668 --> 00:31:56,162

421
00:32:00,048 --> 00:32:02,420
-不 这是私人午餐  -抱歉 
-No. It's a private lunch. -Excuse me.

422
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,342
我帮不了你什么 
There is nothing I can do.

423
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:08,675
我在告诉你我们关门了 明天我们才开 
I'm telling you we're closed today. Tomorrow we'll be open.

424
00:32:08,764 --> 00:32:10,840

抱歉 打扰一下 
Excuse me a minute.

426
00:32:12,643 --> 00:32:15,312
混蛋 你瞎了吗 我们关门了 
Asshole, what are you blind? We're closed!

427
00:32:15,395 --> 00:32:17,518
你说太多了 
You kind of talk too much!

428
00:32:19,315 --> 00:32:22,399
好的 来这 我们给你张桌子 
Yeah, go ahead, come on over, we'll give you a table.

429
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:40,118
你太不可思议了 你在这干吗 
You're unbelievable. What are you doing here?

430
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:43,744
你得转身 然后离开  这是你得做的 
You need to turn around and leave. That's what you need to do.

431
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:54,044
你不打我电话 你不写信 更坏的是 你不接我电话 
You don't call, you don't write. What's worse, you don't take my calls.

432
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:57,009
对不起 对不起 先生...议员...
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir...Senator....

433

Why don't you and I take your little sensitive ponytail...

434
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:06,265
不离开这里呢 
and your little sissy beads, and get out of here, okay?

435
00:33:11,154 --> 00:33:12,648
如我所说...
As I was saying....

436
00:33:13,698 --> 00:33:17,280
议员 如你所见 一些急事 
Senator, as you can see, some urgent business has just come up.

437
00:33:18,202 --> 00:33:20,111
多谢 议员 
Thank you, Senator, so kind.

438
00:33:24,874 --> 00:33:29,334
时间真长 杰克 T 你现在用这名字 对吗 
It's been such a long time, Jack. That's the name you're using now, correct?

439
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,665
暂时 
At the moment.

440
00:33:31,714 --> 00:33:34,714
我能给你些东西尝尝吗  这些太美味了...
Can I get you a bite to eat? The food is truly wonderful...

441
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,839
虽然服务员有些东西 没说 
although the service leaves a little to be desired.

442
00:33:36,927 --> 00:33:40,461
别说废话 我要的是名字 咨询者的名字 
Cut the shit. I need some names, names of consultants.

443
00:33:40,972 --> 00:33:44,590
别告诉我 你照顾不了你自己 
Don't tell me there's a problem you can't take care of yourself?

444
00:33:44,976 --> 00:33:47,846
关于这系列凶杀 我想你知道 
It's about the serial killings. I know you know about them.

445
00:33:47,937 --> 00:33:51,056
是的 关于Ellen很抱歉 
Yes, I do. Truly wicked. Sorry about Ellen.

446

很好的女人 
Wonderful woman.

447
00:33:56,277 --> 00:33:59,611
最后两个凶杀 绝对是专业杀手的杰作  
You know, the last two murders were definitely the work of a pro...

448
00:33:59,697 --> 00:34:01,606
... 不是连环杀手 
not a serial killer.

449
00:34:01,782 --> 00:34:05,400
我有这感觉 你知道这个专业杀手是谁 
And I just have the feeling that you might know who this pro is.

450
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,203
好的 让我猜猜 
Well, let me guess.

451
00:34:09,498 --> 00:34:11,371
我们已经发现你多变的过去...
They've discovered your checkered past...

452
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:13,699
...而现在他们怀疑你 
and now they suspect you.

453
00:34:14,377 --> 00:34:15,788
并不准确 
Not exactly.

454
00:34:15,962 --> 00:34:20,089
他们还没完全了解我的过去  而我知道你了解 
They're still not totally up on my past yet, but I know you are.

455
00:34:21,467 --> 00:34:24,752
因此 我肯定你意识到 我能对你做什么...
Therefore, I'm sure you realize what I'm capable of doing to you...

456
00:34:24,845 --> 00:34:26,303
...如果我不得不 
if I have to.

457
00:34:27,972 --> 00:34:29,716
是的 需要的话 我会做的 
Yes, indeed, I do.

458
00:34:29,807 --> 00:34:31,930
你找哪种咨询者 
What kind of consultant you lookin' for?

459
00:34:32,018 --> 00:34:35,801
那个个人主义者 给了我压力 
This individual gives me the impression that he's a freelancer.

460
00:34:36,105 --> 00:34:39,105
把连环杀手隐藏了起来 
Hiding his targets in the scenario of a serial killer.

461
00:34:39,191 --> 00:34:41,479
像a22*一样 就像暴头 
Likes a .22, likes head shots.

462
00:34:42,235 --> 00:34:45,853
看起来在死者死后 对他们的衣服有些破坏 
Seems to be inflicting costume wounds on the victims after they're dead...

463
00:34:45,947 --> 00:34:48,354
非常高超的清洗技巧 
and has excellent cleaning skills.

464
00:34:48,783 --> 00:34:51,452
我会去打听的 
I'll certainly keep my eyes peeled, and my ears open.

465
00:34:51,535 --> 00:34:54,370
现在那样还不够 
Right now, that's just not gonna be good enough.

466
00:34:54,663 --> 00:34:57,866
杰克 有个问题是 我现在很忙...
Jack, you know there's a problem. I'm kind of busy right now...

467
00:34:57,958 --> 00:34:59,701
在国会作证 
testifying before Congress.

468
00:34:59,793 --> 00:35:04,122
他们对我们从哪取得基金 非常不满...
They're getting kind of cranky about where we get our core-op funds...

469
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,457
不过 为了你...
but, as it's you...

470
00:35:07,967 --> 00:35:10,208
...我会尽我所能 
I'll certainly do the best I can.

471
00:35:10,636 --> 00:35:12,178
为了我们以前 
For old times' sake.

472
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,848
很高兴见到你 哥们 
Good to see you, buddy.

473
00:35:18,351 --> 00:35:19,514
再见 
Bye, buddy.

474
00:35:25,649 --> 00:35:28,982
如果你再那样对我 我就杀了你 
If you ever pull that shit with me again, I'll kill you.

475
00:35:29,069 --> 00:35:33,232
你的所有中国药物 不会再救你一次 
All your little Chinese, moo-shoo pork potions will not save you next time.

476
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,065
你不应该打烂中国药物 
You shouldn't knock Chinese potions.

477
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:38,151
我口袋里有些东西...
I have something in my pocket right now...

478
00:35:38,244 --> 00:35:41,114
能完全把你额头的淤青消掉 
that'll completely clear up that bruise on your forehead.

479
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:42,236
什么淤青 
What bruise?

480
00:35:42,331 --> 00:35:43,529
那个 
That bruise.

481
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:48,513
你合法停车了吗 
Do you validate parking?

482
00:36:56,022 --> 00:36:57,302
你好 Lento 
Hello, Lento's.

483
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:02,269

No, no, no, that' won't work. We're closed for renovation. I'd say...

484
00:37:04,279 --> 00:37:06,521
两个月 是的 谢谢 
two months. Yeah. Thanks.

485
00:37:10,827 --> 00:37:12,487
你和他一起追踪你的猎物 
You're chasing your tail with this one.

486
00:37:12,578 --> 00:37:16,790
他可能从跳蚤市场买来的 我们没办法在哪找到他 
He probably bought it at a flea market. No way we're gonna find him there.

487
00:37:17,416 --> 00:37:21,496
我们不得不重新开始 你们得好好研究 
We're gonna have to go back to basics. You guys gotta do your canvassing.

488
00:37:22,337 --> 00:37:25,208
-你的电话响了  -你没听我说话 
-Your phone is ringing. -You're not listening to me.

看我的口...和那些人说话 
Read my lips...talk to the people!

490

我想我知道你找什么 
I think I know who you're looking for.

我很抱歉我没早找你们 侦探 不过我没有每天
I'm sorry I didn't call you guys sooner, Detective, but I don't open...

493
00:37:43,273 --> 00:37:47,484
开邮箱 
my mail every day. There's so much, it kind of gets away from me.

494
00:37:48,653 --> 00:37:52,021
我通常每星期在 监狱教两天艺术

在我看到巨大的十字架时...
Then when I saw the titian crucifixion...

505

他是我最喜欢的学生

看到了吗 我所有的教学方法是有组织的 
See, my whole approach is organic.

508
00:38:28,688 --> 00:38:30,099
我从内在影响开始...
I start on the inside influence...

509
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:33,605
然后我试着去 设计学生的内在生活 
and then I try to draw on the student's inner life.

510
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:37,643
正是让他们找到时候
It's about having them find the moment. A moment without...

511
00:38:38,823 --> 00:38:40,945
我得赶快回到九十年代 
I've got to hurry back to the nineties now.

在929 Barrow街九个区内 有天主教堂 
a Catholic Church within a nine-block radius of 929 Barrow Street?

526

祝福我 教父 我犯罪了 
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

这样行不通 哥们 在教堂里...
This isn't gonna work, buddy. Here in a church...

530
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:55,479
会伤着牧师的 
with the priest?

531
00:40:55,946 --> 00:40:58,104
我不想伤害人 
I don't want to be hurting people.

532
00:40:58,615 --> 00:40:59,990
我不想 
I don't like to.

533
00:41:00,616 --> 00:41:03,321
我能和牧师说句话吗 
Could I please speak with the priest?

534
00:41:06,455 --> 00:41:10,404
你允许我 和教父说句话吗 
Could I have your permission to please speak with the Father a minute?

535
00:41:10,834 --> 00:41:12,957
我知道你不想伤害他 
I know you don't want to hurt him.

536
00:41:13,044 --> 00:41:14,123
教父...
Father...

537
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,957
来这里 
come here, please.

538
00:41:17,632 --> 00:41:18,794
现在 
Right away.

539
00:41:28,183 --> 00:41:29,558
离开这里 
Get out of here.

540
00:41:36,649 --> 00:41:38,392
他们在找我吗 
Are they searching for me?

541
00:41:38,484 --> 00:41:39,978
是的 长官 
Yes, sir, they are.

542
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,317
你怎么知道我在这里 
How did you know I'd be here?

543
00:41:43,196 --> 00:41:47,657
我只是猜的  这是离你家最近的教堂 
Well, I just took a lucky guess. It's the closest church to your home.

544
00:41:48,534 --> 00:41:51,108
你是新来的警察 
You're the new cop they brought in, right?

545
00:41:51,203 --> 00:41:53,528
是的 长官 你怎么知道 
Yes, sir, I am. How'd you know?

546
00:41:53,956 --> 00:41:56,873
我留意这些事  这是我工作的一部分 
I keep track of these things. It's part of my job.

547
00:42:01,212 --> 00:42:02,457
这样 你知道  
So, you know...

548
00:42:03,673 --> 00:42:05,998
你杀了我前妻 
you killed my ex-wife, don't you?

549
00:42:10,888 --> 00:42:13,213
我想你知道我没伤害她 
I want you to know I didn't hurt her.

550
00:42:13,807 --> 00:42:14,720
你没有 
You didn't?

551
00:42:14,808 --> 00:42:18,011
我只杀了别人叫我一定要杀的 
I only kill who I was told to kill, who I had to kill.

552
00:42:18,353 --> 00:42:19,811
解决掉的 
The Roslovs?

553
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,725
The Dunleavys 
The Dunleavys?

554
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,398
你杀了他们吗 
Did you kill them?

555
00:42:23,816 --> 00:42:25,275
我放了他们 
I was spared them.

556
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:27,651
另外人干的 
Someone else was called.

00:42:27,736 --> 00:42:29,978
谁叫你干的 Christopher 
Who was given the call, Christopher?

558
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,779
这里太痛苦了 我得走了 
There's too much pain here. I gotta go now.

559
00:42:33,867 --> 00:42:34,946
听我说 
Listen to me.

560
00:42:35,034 --> 00:42:36,066
你停下 
You, stay!

561
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,405
听我说

00:42:38,788 --> 00:42:41,575
祝福我 教父 我已犯罪了  我最后的招认...
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. My last confession...

563

-是六个月前  -Christopher
-was six months ago. -Christopher, please....

564
00:42:45,419 --> 00:42:46,664
那你帮我 
Then you help me.

565
00:42:46,753 --> 00:42:48,710
-你帮我  -我不能这么做
-You help me. -I can't do that.

566
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,122
我在地狱 我在地狱 
I am in hell! I am in hell!

567
00:42:51,883 --> 00:42:53,674
听我说 听我说 
Listen to me. Listen to me.

568
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,879
你不这么做我就杀了你 
Do it now or I will kill you! You believe it?

569
00:42:58,347 --> 00:43:00,505
-一...二...  -这是上帝的房间 
-One...two.... -This is God's house.

570
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:02,638
-别逼我 
-Don't make me do this. -Please.

571
00:43:02,768 --> 00:43:04,310
-别  -三 
-Don't! -Three!

572
00:43:26,289 --> 00:43:28,696
这是Maynard的枪 帮我留着 
This is Maynard's gun. Book it for me.

573
00:43:31,585 --> 00:43:34,158
这太坏了 杰克 
This is bad, Jack. This is real bad, man.

574
00:43:34,379 --> 00:43:36,288
我不能为了输而赢 
I can't win for losin', man.

575
00:43:37,966 --> 00:43:40,753
我不想让这事发生 
I tried so hard not to let this happen.

576
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:45,382
我们搜索了他的房子 找到了 所有的工具 
We tossed his house, we found all kinds of shit: barbed wire, spikes....

577
00:43:45,473 --> 00:43:47,798
-他正是我们找的那家伙  -
-He was definitely our guy. -Shit.

578
00:43:51,144 --> 00:43:53,101
你在这干什么  
What the fuck are you doin' here?

579
00:43:53,188 --> 00:43:56,142
我只是想 他回不了家了...
Well, I just thought that he wouldn't be home...

580
00:43:56,232 --> 00:43:58,474
可能我在教堂能找到他 
maybe I'd find him at the church.

581
00:43:58,568 --> 00:43:59,943
你是来杀他的吗 
So, you came to blow him away?

582
00:44:00,027 --> 00:44:03,526
不是 长官 他想杀我  我没选择 
No sir, he drew on me, tried to kill me. I had no choice.

583
00:44:04,406 --> 00:44:08,569
没选择 牧师告诉我 你让他走的 说他很冷静 
No choice? The priest told me you let him go. Said he was calm.

584
00:44:10,328 --> 00:44:12,321
我们永远不会知道 是吗 
We'll never know, will we?

585
00:44:12,956 --> 00:44:15,162
就像纽约的DeMarco 
It's just like DeMarco in New York.

586
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,417
你一个人出来 而疑犯死了 
You come out alone...the suspect is dead.

587
00:44:18,836 --> 00:44:20,875
长官 我们确认了他的身份
Captain, we had a positive lD on...

588
00:44:20,963 --> 00:44:22,373
闭嘴 
Shut the fuck up!

589
00:44:22,839 --> 00:44:25,413
我不想个人主义的警察 在我手下办事 
I don't want freelance cops working for me!

590
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:27,543
我要你...
I want you...and you...

591
00:44:28,636 --> 00:44:30,629
明早找国际刑警 
lnternal Affairs, tomorrow morning.

592
00:44:30,722 --> 00:44:31,966
别迟到 
Don't be late.

593
00:44:44,067 --> 00:44:46,605
别急 我们在找poly 
Not so fast. We're sendin' for the poly.

594
00:44:51,699 --> 00:44:53,406
你告诉他什么 
So, what'd you tell him?

595
00:44:53,951 --> 00:44:57,782
所有 指纹 过去 
Everything. The prints, the bullshit past, the whole nine.

596
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,369
你逼我这么做的 杰克 
You didn't leave me any choice, Jack.

597
00:45:01,457 --> 00:45:03,948
嘿 朋友就是这样的吗 
Hey, that's what friends are for, right?

598
00:45:06,128 --> 00:45:08,370
我会开始 问你几个问题...
I'll start by asking you a few test questions...

599

没有 
No.

609
00:45:39,116 --> 00:45:41,607

616
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:57,923
我认为这和调查无关
I don't think that's pertinent to this investigation.

617
00:45:58,008 --> 00:45:59,467
回答有或没有

I've never seen anything like this. Everything reads true.

有可能在这仪器下说谎吗 
Can someone learn to beat this thing?

623
00:46:19,778 --> 00:46:23,775
有可能的 不过你得 完全控制你得感情 
It's possible, but you'd have to have total control over your emotions.

我不认为有人能 
I don't know anybody who could pull that off.

625
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:30,028
你想我做什么 杰克

637
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:55,471
没把子弹射入他儿子脑袋 的那个 
for not shooting his son in the goddamn head.

638
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,054
事情总是在变化的 
Yeah, things change.

639
00:46:57,562 --> 00:46:59,554
联邦调查局在调查你 杰克 
Internal Affairs is lookin' at you, Jack...

640
00:46:59,647 --> 00:47:02,138
就是他们也在调查我 
which means they're lookin' at me, too.

641
00:47:02,232 --> 00:47:05,352
我得暂时撤消你职位 直到我们从这麻烦里脱身 
I'm gonna suspend you until we can sort this shit out.

642
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:10,069
我以为你知道 我是被陷害的 
You know, I somehow think that you know I'm gettin' screwed.

643
00:47:10,448 --> 00:47:12,856
好 那就告诉担心的Beads 
Yeah, well, tell it to the worry beads.

644
00:47:13,242 --> 00:47:15,531
没人跟你冒险 杰克 
No one's takin' any chances with you, Jack.

You're officially a suspect in the murder of your ex-wife and her husband.

Give me your lD, your badge and make sure we know where you are...

647
00:47:22,793 --> 00:47:24,832
因为联邦调查局在查你 
'cause lA is comin' for you.

648
00:47:28,881 --> 00:47:31,372
你要哪个 
Which one of these did you just piss in?

649
00:47:37,806 --> 00:47:38,802
混蛋 
Son of a bitch.

650

Listen. When he was in New York...

658
00:48:16,674 --> 00:48:20,292

Guy's a weirdo, you said so yourself.

664
00:48:34,023 --> 00:48:38,435
让联邦调查局来处理吧 他们把两件事作为一个案子处理 
Just let Internal Affairs handle it. They're puttin' a case together right now.

665
00:48:42,739 --> 00:48:45,312
离他远点 
Stay away from him. He's bad news.

666
00:51:39,815 --> 00:51:41,772
有些地方出错了 
I take it something is amiss.

667
00:51:43,652 --> 00:51:44,896
他在哪干什么 
What was he doing there?

668
00:51:44,986 --> 00:51:47,228
看起来他 不象在找些特别的东西吗 
Didn't look like he was after anything specific.

669
00:51:47,322 --> 00:51:49,314
别担心 
Nothing to worry about.

670
00:51:50,616 --> 00:51:54,779
没证据把你和Roslov女人联系在一起 
Got halfway through the place. Nothing there to connect you to the Roslov woman.

671
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:56,993
我希望如此 
I hope not, for your sake.

672
00:51:57,831 --> 00:52:00,037
你应该几天前就 调查过那房子 
You should've gone through that house days ago.

673
00:52:00,125 --> 00:52:02,450
我不想做扫除 
I'm not supposed to be doing cleanup.

674
00:52:13,178 --> 00:52:14,637
她在哪 你见过她吗 
Where is she? Have you seen her?

675
00:52:14,721 --> 00:52:17,473
不 我找不到她 她离开酒店了 
No, I can't find her. She checked out of the hotel.

676
00:52:17,557 --> 00:52:19,964
不过这便条在你刚离开后来的 
But this note camejust after you left.

677
00:52:26,815 --> 00:52:28,855
我不能和你去...
"I cannot go with you...

678
00:52:29,651 --> 00:52:31,478
或者再次见到你 
"...or ever see you again.

679
00:52:33,238 --> 00:52:36,772
-我爱你 亲爱的  -这是最后一个电话 Richard先生 
-"I love you...my darling". -That's the last call, Mr. Richard.

680
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,859
上帝祝福你 
"God bless you".

681
00:52:42,371 --> 00:52:44,328
-发生什么事了  -到底怎么了 
-What's happenin'? -What's up?

682
00:52:45,207 --> 00:52:47,828
-你到底在这干什么  -我们要谈一下 
-What the hell you doin' here? -Gotta talk.

683
00:52:48,918 --> 00:52:51,540
-那不是眼泪吧  -不是 
-Those aren't tears, are they? -No, man.

684
00:52:54,257 --> 00:52:56,463
我打哈欠时就会流眼泪 如此而已 
My eyes leak sometimes when I yawn, that's all.

685
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:57,961
-你眼睛流泪  -是的 
-They leak? -Yeah.

686
00:52:58,886 --> 00:53:00,677
-你眼睛流泪  -你想怎么样 
-They leak. -What do you want?

687
00:53:00,762 --> 00:53:03,134
-让我  -等等 我没事 
-Let me just... -Wait...I'm fine.

688
00:53:03,432 --> 00:53:04,842
你想怎样 
What do you want?

689
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:07,888
我得和你谈话  好啊 
-I gotta talk to you. -All right, come on.

690
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:12,510
如果有个连环杀手逍遥法外...
What if there's a serial killer out there...

691
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:16,271
他杀了很多家庭 我们叫他家庭杀手 
he's killin' families, we nickname him "The Family Man".

692
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,232
不过还有别人...
But there's somebody else out there...

693
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:21,898
做更阴险的事 
who has somethin' more sinister goin' on.

694
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,362
他想把他对头杀掉 
He has to terminate some targets.

695
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:28,033
他杀了他的对头的全家...
So, he kills his targets and their entire families to make himself...

696
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,077
让人看起来象家庭杀手的手法 
look like The Family Man.

697
00:53:30,289 --> 00:53:32,281
当我们在找那个连环杀手时
While we're lookin' for a serial killer.

698
00:53:32,374 --> 00:53:35,624
实际上有两个人 而其中一个才是专业 
When, in fact, there's two of 'em and one of 'em is a pro.

699
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:39,245
-你怎么知道他是专业  -专业才做得出这样的杰作 
-How do you know it's a pro? -'Cause I know the work of a pro.

700
00:53:40,048 --> 00:53:42,373
我在Sonya Roslov的房间里找到这个 
I found this in Sonya Roslov's house.

701
00:53:42,717 --> 00:53:44,460
这是去莫斯科的往返机票
It's a round trip to Moscow...

702
00:53:44,552 --> 00:53:46,628
Deverell 企业支付的 
bought and paid for by Deverell Industries.

703
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,045
你认为Deverell和这事 有关系 
You think Frank Deverell had somethin' to do with this?

704
00:53:49,139 --> 00:53:50,254
是的 
I do, sir.

705
00:53:51,975 --> 00:53:54,347
她是个翻译 
Sonya Roslov, she was a translator.

706
00:53:54,436 --> 00:53:56,475
如果Deverell在俄罗斯有生意的话
If Deverell did any business in Russia...

707
00:53:56,562 --> 00:53:58,638
他请那样的人也不奇怪 
it makes sense he'd hire someone like that.

708
00:53:58,731 --> 00:54:01,518
如果她是个走私犯呢  走私什么 
-What if she was a mule? -Smuggling what?

709
00:54:02,067 --> 00:54:04,392
化学武器什么的 
Chemical weapons of some kind.

710
00:54:06,154 --> 00:54:07,696
墙倒了...
Now that the Wall fell...

711
00:54:07,781 --> 00:54:10,153
到处是涌进来的东西 
there's a ton of that stuff floatin' around.

712
00:54:10,241 --> 00:54:12,815
那能解释她的癌症 
That would explain the cancer in her body.

713
00:54:13,036 --> 00:54:15,953
如果你发现谁在黑市 控制这玩意...
If you look at who controls that stuff on the black market...

714
00:54:16,038 --> 00:54:17,319
是俄罗斯黑帮 
it's the Russian Mafia.

715
00:54:17,415 --> 00:54:19,988
和袭击我们的一样  是的 
-As in the guys who jumped us. -You got it.

716
00:54:20,125 --> 00:54:22,698
这样 那什么把Dunleavys和Deverell 联系起来呢 
So, what connects the Dunleavys to Deverell?

717
00:54:22,794 --> 00:54:25,712
我还不知道 不过我知道我们 会找出来的 
I don't know yet, but I know we could find out.

718
00:54:26,423 --> 00:54:29,957
你知道 他们会收了我的徽章  如果他们知道我和你一起调查 
You know, they will take my badge if they find out I'm workin' with you.

719
00:54:30,051 --> 00:54:32,921
不过我直觉告诉我你可能是对的 
But, my gut tells me you might be right.

720
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,886
-我一直相信我的直觉  -好的 
-I always go with my gut. -Okay.

721
00:54:39,935 --> 00:54:43,599
我对你不了解 但我会 看完剩下的电影 
I don't know about you, but I'm gonna go see the rest of this movie.

722
00:54:43,688 --> 00:54:45,182
是个好电影吗 
Is it a good movie?

723
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:48,440
你没看过Casablanca 
You've never seen Casablanca?

724
00:54:48,526 --> 00:54:51,645
你在问我有没看过Casablanca 
You're asking me if I've ever seen Casablanca?

725
00:54:52,279 --> 00:54:53,109
你看过 
Have you?

726
00:54:53,197 --> 00:54:55,948
你在开玩笑吧 没看过
You gotta be kidding. Me? Never seen Casablanca?

727
00:54:56,033 --> 00:54:57,491
你看过吗 
Have you ever seen Casablanca?

728
00:54:57,576 --> 00:54:58,405
没看过 
No.

729
00:54:59,202 --> 00:55:00,482
不会吧 
Come on.

730
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:06,659
当然 Donald没失去任何东西 除了他的自尊 
And of course, Donald survived with everything but his pride intact.

731
00:55:07,793 --> 00:55:10,580
我没想到Cole
I never expected Cole to get this close.

732
00:55:11,505 --> 00:55:14,790
我想你最好 看牢点你的前雇员 
I thought you kept better track of your ex-employees.

733
00:55:16,342 --> 00:55:19,213
没有迹象他和 这有关 
No way to anticipate he'd become this involved.

734
00:55:19,804 --> 00:55:22,508
他是谁 很明显不仅仅是个警察 
Who is he? Obviously not just a cop.

735
00:55:23,682 --> 00:55:27,051
他是个优秀的战士  西点之类 
He was a brilliant soldier. West Point, that kind of thing.

736
00:55:27,811 --> 00:55:32,058
我在越南找到他 把他编入特别行动组 
I found him in Vietnam. Recruited him for a special projects unit.

737
00:55:33,358 --> 00:55:35,315
我们对那程序的称呼 
The Program, we called it.

738
00:55:35,485 --> 00:55:38,106
他为我们处理了很多奇怪的事 
He handled a lot of odd jobs for us.

739
00:55:38,863 --> 00:55:40,855
-例如  -现在 Deverell先生...
-Such as? -Now, Mr. Deverell...

740
00:55:41,156 --> 00:55:43,908
别问你并不想 知道的事 
don't ask about things you don't really want to know.

741
00:55:43,992 --> 00:55:46,827
对于他追捕的那些人...
Suffice to say, to the people he hunted for us...

742
00:55:46,911 --> 00:55:49,581
他被称为"魔鬼尖兵"
he was known as "The Glimmer Man".

743
00:55:50,832 --> 00:55:52,954
除了丛林什么都没有...
There'd be nothing but jungle...

744
00:55:53,876 --> 00:55:55,454
而后一闪...
then a glimmer...

745
00:55:57,421 --> 00:55:59,045
然后你就死了 
then you'd be dead.

746
00:55:59,673 --> 00:56:01,915
为什么他不和你一起了 
Why isn't he still with you?

747
00:56:02,175 --> 00:56:06,007
他84年离开了特别行动组 对我们来说很正常 
He was booted out of the program in '84. Went native on us.

748
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:09,839
他有了他自己的安排 
Made up his own assignments.

749
00:56:10,016 --> 00:56:12,008
消失了几个月 
Disappeared...for months.

750
00:56:12,393 --> 00:56:14,385
在泰国出现 
Ended up in Thailand...

751
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:17,808
在一些庙里唱着圣歌 
chanting in some temple or other.

752
00:56:18,565 --> 00:56:21,186
他们说他被一个圣人救了 
They say he was saved by a holy man.

753
00:56:22,694 --> 00:56:26,905
这家伙这么多故事  我都不知哪个事真的 
So many stories about this fella, I don't know which ones are true anymore.

754
00:56:32,995 --> 00:56:35,201
我们要对他怎样呢  清除他 
-What do we do about him? -Broom him.

755
00:56:36,039 --> 00:56:38,956
是除去知道 事情的人的时候了 
Time to lose everybody who knows anythin'.

756
00:56:41,169 --> 00:56:43,042
我说的是所有人 
And I mean everybody.

757
00:56:44,964 --> 00:56:46,458
Johny没威胁啊 
Johnny's no threat.

758
00:56:47,799 --> 00:56:51,250
我不这么认为 他已经 和这事脱不开了 
I beg to differ. He's already spilled to the shrink.

759
00:56:53,012 --> 00:56:56,013
那可怜的孩子知道太多了  就这么简单 
The poor boy knows too much. Simple as that.

760
00:56:57,433 --> 00:56:59,057
Johnny会听我的话的 
Johnny'll do what I say.

761
00:56:59,143 --> 00:57:01,385
让我这样说 
Let me put this another way.

762
00:57:01,812 --> 00:57:04,599
这案子有四条线索
I have four loose links in this operation:

763
00:57:04,898 --> 00:57:07,056
两个警察 你和这孩子 
Two cops, you, and the boy.

764
00:57:08,109 --> 00:57:09,817
你们中的三个得死 
Three of you have to go.

765
00:57:10,069 --> 00:57:11,896
你能选是哪三个 
You can choose which three.

766
00:57:15,116 --> 00:57:17,357
你得自己去决定 
You'll have to do it yourself.

767
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:19,452
Frank 我负责Johnny 
Frank, I'll take care of Johnny.

768
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:22,109
我们得照料Cole和Campbell 
Who's gonna take care of Cole and Campbell?

769
00:57:22,289 --> 00:57:24,614
我会派Donald处理其他人 
I'll put Donald on the others right away.

770
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:26,285
这就对了 
That's the spirit.

771
00:57:26,459 --> 00:57:29,032
来啊 水很好 
Now, come on in. The water's fine.

772
00:59:53,675 --> 00:59:54,670
混蛋 
Shit!

773
01:00:44,971 --> 01:00:46,963
把孩子带到楼上去 
Take the kids upstairs.

774
01:00:53,562 --> 01:00:55,221
-John Cole  -是的 
-John Cole? -Yes.

775
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,852
我们是联邦调查局的Miller 和 Russo 
Miller and Russo from Internal Affairs.

776
01:00:57,941 --> 01:01:00,099
我们有你的拘捕证 
We have a warrant for your arrest.

777
01:01:00,526 --> 01:01:03,278
你需要收拾些东西吗 
Do you want to take a minute to gather a few things?

778
01:01:03,362 --> 01:01:06,197
不用 我准备好走了 
No, that's perfectly all right. I'm ready to go.

779
01:01:57,869 --> 01:02:00,111
我记忆中洛杉矶最冷的冬天 
Coldest winter I can remember in LA.

780
01:02:00,914 --> 01:02:02,372
也是最湿的 
Wettest, too.

781
01:04:03,941 --> 01:04:05,518
他们也对付你 
They got you, too.

782
01:04:05,609 --> 01:04:08,230
不 在暴乱后我买下了所有的毒品
No, I bought all this shit after the riots.

783
01:04:08,403 --> 01:04:10,858
表示我们是一起的 我们在同一条船上 
It means we're close, man, we're close.

784
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:12,822
我看起来像
Do I look like I give a shit?

785
01:04:12,907 --> 01:04:17,118
因为他们要抓到我们两
You better give a shit, 'cause they ain't gonna stop till they get us both.

786
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:23,449
这是鹿角 
Does this say, "deer antler"?

787
01:04:24,543 --> 01:04:26,037
给我 
Give me that.

788
01:04:27,128 --> 01:04:30,461
-这是个免费的例子  -整个案子就在这 
-It was a free sample. -There's a whole case over here.

789
01:04:30,548 --> 01:04:32,540
离开我 
Just stay out of my shit.

790
01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:36,750
我能告诉你 我现在到底有多激动吗 
Can I just take this moment to tell you how moved I am deeply?

791
01:04:36,929 --> 01:04:39,087
好的 
Yeah, well, that makes one of us.

792
01:04:39,890 --> 01:04:42,511
我在你前妻的电话记录里发现了些东西 
I found somethin' on your ex-wife's phone records.

793
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,925
有人在她被杀那晚给她打了电话 
Someone called the house the night she was killed.

794
01:04:45,019 --> 01:04:49,348
他们打了六次 每次 只谈了15秒 
They called six times, only talked about 10 or 15 seconds each time.

795
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:51,933
你有号码吗 
You got a number or somethin'?

796

他不敢从家里打

831
01:07:06,897 --> 01:07:07,928
为什么 
Why?

832
01:07:08,106 --> 01:07:11,771
他的继父 Johnny知道 他继父在干些不好的事情 
His stepfather. Johnny knew some bad things he was doing.

833
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:15,110

他继父把他带走了 
His stepfather put him away at Our Lady Of Angels.

835
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:23,651
你认为Deverell会 杀他自己的儿子吗 
You don't think Deverell would kill his own stepson, do you?

836
01:07:25,205 --> 01:07:28,122
蠢问题 让我们离开这里 
Right. Dumb question. Let's get out of here.

837
01:08:25,717 --> 01:08:28,338
-你好吗 Johnny  -是的 没这么好过 
-You all right, Johnny? -Yeah, never been better.

838
01:08:28,428 --> 01:08:31,179
我们要问你些 关于你继父的问题

839
01:08:31,264 --> 01:08:32,639
他是个混蛋

所有人都冷静下来 警察

845
01:08:49,739 --> 01:08:51,019
他为什么这样做 
Why'd he do it?

846
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:54,152
好的 他让Donald杀了他的翻译...
Okay, he had Donald kill his translator...

847
01:08:55,536 --> 01:08:59,996
因为她知道我父亲 从俄罗斯走私些不好的东西

848
01:09:00,874 --> 01:09:02,783
我发现了它

849
01:09:03,084 --> 01:09:06,583

So, he got all freaked out, and thought I told Dr. Dunleavy.

850
01:09:07,088 --> 01:09:09,792
所以他让Donald杀了他和他妻子 
So he had Donald kill him and his wife...

851
01:09:09,882 --> 01:09:12,373
然后让它看起来想连环杀手干的

把他和他作案武器交给我

为什么要这么复杂 
Why does this gotta be so complicated?

938
01:14:48,394 --> 01:14:50,517
不复杂  只是场游戏 
This isn't complicated. It's nothing but a game.

939
01:14:50,604 --> 01:14:52,644
让我想起一个老波斯战略家...

教导他年轻部队战术

老战士喜欢等...
Old warriors like to wait...

945
01:15:06,243 --> 01:15:10,287
让对手充分暴露 从而陷入绝境

946
01:15:10,372 --> 01:15:12,863

真破 不过挺奇特 
Shabby, but chic.

960
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:37,453
要不是我们早了...
Either we're a little early...

961
01:17:37,546 --> 01:17:39,752
就时我们的主人来晚了 
or our hosts are a little late.

962

What the hell is going on, Donald?

963

01:17:54,269 --> 01:17:58,515
你认为你能把我交给Cole 
You think you're gonna hand me over to Cole. Bad move, fruitcake.

965
01:17:59,857 --> 01:18:02,265
我不知道你在说什么 
I don't know what you're talking about.

966
01:18:06,196 --> 01:18:07,690
你离不开这里了 
You'll never get out of here.

967
01:18:07,781 --> 01:18:09,857
不 我的表演现在开始

肯定事莎士比亚风格 
Positively Shakespearean.

969

是
"To be...

970
01:18:22,878 --> 01:18:23,624

971

01:18:25,047 --> 01:18:27,917
等等 我们不知道 这有多少人 
Wait. We don't know how many guys are in there.

973
01:18:28,008 --> 01:18:31,293
你想我干什么  等他们互相残杀吗 
What do you want me to do? Wait till they all kill each other?

974
01:18:31,386 --> 01:18:33,259
如果老战士有耐心...
If the old warriors are patient and...

975
01:18:33,346 --> 01:18:35,634
而年轻战士相互惨杀
all the young warriors, they kill each other and...

976
01:18:35,723 --> 01:18:37,133
这就是我们为什么老的原因 
that's how we get to be old.

977
01:18:37,224 --> 01:18:38,932
我喜欢这个计划 你听好 
I like that plan too. You listened well.

978
01:18:39,017 --> 01:18:40,761
那是我在酒吧你告诉你的

979
01:18:40,852 --> 01:18:43,224
我不知道为什么我不听自己的话 我真笨 
I don't know why I don't listen to myself. I'm stupid.

980
01:18:43,313 --> 01:18:44,688
我们等吧 
Let's just wait.

981

-拐过那个拐角  -好的 你这混蛋快拐过拐角

把Whoopi Goldberg带上 
And take little Whoopi Goldberg with you.

992
01:20:40,084 --> 01:20:41,329

Hi 
Hi!

996
01:21:51,232 --> 01:21:52,311
离开这里 
Out here!

997
01:21:55,235 --> 01:21:58,152
快点 我不能坚持太久 
Hurry, man! I can't hold on much longer!

998
01:22:00,740 --> 01:22:03,278
噢 上帝 别往下看 
Oh, God, don't look down. Don't look down.

999
01:22:04,910 --> 01:22:06,369
噢 别往上看 
Oh, don't look up.

1000

好的 坚持一下 
All right, hang on.

1001
01:22:20,007 --> 01:22:21,916
是个好主意 
Yeah. That's a good idea, man.

1002
01:22:22,009 --> 01:22:24,085
我不应该想到这个主意 
I wouldn't have thought of that.

1003
01:22:26,805 --> 01:22:29,011
好的 你准备好了吗  准备什么

Is that your gun or are you gettin' excited, man?

1007

1012
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:36,945
一直 
All the time.

1013
01:23:40,663 --> 01:23:43,201
你不会再听到了 
You're not gonna have to hear it anymore.

1014

当你早上醒来 照镜子的时候...
When you wake up in the morning and look in the mirror...

1017

我想你会高兴的...
l think you're probably happy...

1018
01:24:23,118 --> 01:24:26,403
而那使我烦恼 
pleased at what you see. And that disturbs me.

1019
01:24:28,122 --> 01:24:30,791
作为我的责任 我得这么做...
So, I'm gonna take it on as my responsibility...

to make sure that you never get to look in the mirror again.

I woke up happy, I'm going to bed happy 'cause you're gonna be dead.

1022

Take your best shot.

1023
01:25:25,799 --> 01:25:27,507

1024
01:25:29,511 --> 01:25:30,459
无聊 
Boring.

1025
01:25:42,314 --> 01:25:44,306
你最好只能如此吗 
Is that the best you got, boy?

1026
01:25:46,568 --> 01:25:50,019
如果你只能如此 那我就不得不杀你了 
If that's the best you got, I'm just gonna have to kill you.

1027
01:25:53,782 --> 01:25:55,324
你就这么两下吗 
Is that all you got?

1028
01:26:14,092 --> 01:26:17,295
看来你不能 醒来时高兴了 
You don't look like you're gonna be wakin' up happy now.

1029
01:26:58,632 --> 01:26:59,711
嘿 长官 
Hey, Capt.

1030
01:26:59,967 --> 01:27:01,876
你看起来有些粗暴 Campbell 
You're looking a little rough there, Campbell.

1031
01:27:01,969 --> 01:27:04,376
他们说我得搞定它

我对你抱歉 杰克 
Guess I owe you an apology, Jack.

1033
01:27:06,806 --> 01:27:08,597
上帝 那不好吗 
God, wouldn't that be nice?

1034
01:27:09,475 --> 01:27:11,468
你不会得到得 
Well, you're not gonna get it.

1035
01:27:12,687 --> 01:27:14,478
不过我欠你的啊

1036
01:27:15,648 --> 01:27:18,019
帮我个忙 告诉我妻子我活着 而且很好 
Do me a favor, tell my wife I'm alive and well.

1037

1038
01:27:19,735 --> 01:27:20,730
感觉好点了 孩子 
Feel better, kid.

1039
01:27:20,819 --> 01:27:21,732
嗯
Yeah.

1040
01:27:23,988 --> 01:27:27,606
杰克 如果我们几天没说话会如何 
Say, Jack. How about we not talk for a couple of days?

1041
01:27:28,534 --> 01:27:29,945
我说了什么 
Somethin' I said?

1042
01:27:30,077 --> 01:27:33,493
从你做我的搭档开始
It's just that ever since you started bein' my partner...

1043
01:27:34,122 --> 01:27:36,613
我被打 被枪击
I've been beat up, blown up...

1044
01:27:38,043 --> 01:27:40,165
被从窗户踢出去
shot, kicked out a window...

1045
01:27:41,296 --> 01:27:44,249
我所有的东西都被烧了 
all my worldly possessions burnt to a crisp.

1046
01:27:44,715 --> 01:27:46,672
准确的说 我无家可归 
Basically, I'm homeless.

1047
01:27:47,801 --> 01:27:50,043
从我遇到你后就没好事发生过 
Not one good thing has happened since I met you.

1048
01:27:50,137 --> 01:27:51,714
你得试试鹿阳粉 
You got to try powdered deer penis.

1049
01:27:51,805 --> 01:27:53,216
那会有用的 
That should count for something.

1050
01:27:53,306 --> 01:27:56,260
别打我电话 别给我留言 
Don't call me, Jack. Don't leave me a message.

1051
01:27:56,434 --> 01:28:00,514
也别给我传真 如果 我在我窗户看到一只鸟腿上绑着纸条...
Don't fax me. If I see a bird on my window with a message on its foot...

1052
01:28:00,688 --> 01:28:02,597
我会把它扔出去 
I'm throwin' him back out.

1053
01:28:02,690 --> 01:28:03,472
别送花来 
Don't send flowers.

1054
01:28:05,192 --> 01:28:06,935
忘了你认识我 杰克 
Forget you know me, Jack!
