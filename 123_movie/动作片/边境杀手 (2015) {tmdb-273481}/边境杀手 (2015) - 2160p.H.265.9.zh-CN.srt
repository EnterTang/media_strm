00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:25,000

2
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,120
趴下，趴下!
<b>Get down! Get down!</b>

3
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,300
不许动
<b>Don't move!</b>

4
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,680
联邦调查局, 不许动!
<b>FBI! Don't move!</b>

5
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,560
趴下，趴下!
<b>Get down! Get down!</b>

6
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,280
人质在哪里?人质在哪里?
<b>Where are the hostages? Where are the hostages?</b>

7
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,860
- 联邦调查局，警察！别动！ - 趴下！别动
<b>- FBI, Police! Don't move! - Down! Stay down!</b>

8
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,560
双腿交叉 双手抱头
<b>Cross your legs! Cross your legs and put your hands in the air!</b>

9
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,120
警察 不许动，不许动! 趴下，趴下!
<b>Police! Don't move! Police! Don't move! Get down! Get down!</b>

10
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,880
都不许动 警察 这边清场!
<b>- Clear! - Police! Search warrant. Don't move!</b>

11
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,920
- 警察 不许动
<b>- Steppin' out! - Police, don't move!</b>

12
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,040
警察，别动！ 现在清场！
<b>Police, don't move! Search warrant!</b>

13
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,240
联邦调查局！
<b>FBI!</b>

14
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,280
你中枪了吗?
<b>Are you hit?</b>

15
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,440
我没事.
<b>I'm good.</b>

16
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,980
他妈的！
<b>Fuck!</b>

17
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,440
前面 交给你了
<b>Front, you're clear!</b>

18
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,450
队长 怎么样？
<b>Team leader! Status?</b>

19
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,080
领队，你那边的状况?
<b>- Front clear! - We're clear, ma'am!</b>

20
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,840
已经清场，长官，正在拘捕嫌犯.
<b>Two suspects in custody!</b>

21
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,600
- 还好吧，梅瑟? - 嗯.
<b>- You okay, Macer? - Yeah.</b>

22
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,040
你确定这里有人质吗?
<b>Why'd he shoot? There's no one here.</b>

23
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,960
哇...
<b>Whoa...</b>

24
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,560
什么鬼...
<b>What the fuck?</b>

25
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,360
上帝
<b>Jesus!</b>

26
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,090
那些不是人质.
<b>Those weren't our hostages.</b>

27
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,520
不是，那是别的什么.
<b>No. That was somethin' else.</b>

28
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,540
- 梅瑟. - 嗯?
<b>- Macer? - Yeah?</b>

29
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,900
检控官想要一个报告，你想让我怎么说?
<b>U.S. Attorney wants a statement. What do you want me to say to her?</b>

30
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,080
照实说.
<b>The truth.</b>

31
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,170
看起来像是索诺拉干的
<b>Looks like Sonora.</b>

32
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,400
是的.
<b>Yeah.</b>

33
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,800
总共有多少个?
<b>How many, total?</b>

34
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,000
大厅这里有15个，后面卧室里大概有20个.
<b>We've got 15 in this hall here, about 20 in the back bedroom.</b>

35
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,050
我们甚至还没开始检查阁楼.
<b>We haven't even checked the attic or under the crawl space.</b>

36
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,240
通知国防部，我们需要他们的人过来.
<b>Call DOJ, let 'em know what we have.</b>

37
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,920
这房子是曼努埃尔·迪亚兹的吗？
<b>This one of the houses owned by Manuel Diaz?</b>

38
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,640
是他的房子，但这事扯不到他头上.
<b>No way to connect him, but he owns it.</b>

39
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
我的老天.
<b>Jesus Christ.</b>

40
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,840
雷吉，去外面透口气吧.
<b>Reg, step out. It's okay.</b>

41
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,040
维克斯! 需要一个断线钳！
<b>Vickers! I need bolt cutters!</b>

42
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,280
维克斯.
<b>Vickers!</b>

43
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,520
探员好像发现了什么.
<b>PD found something.</b>

44
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,560
放松。
<b>Relax.</b>

45
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,850
在凤凰城附近发现了大量尸体.
<b>Such a heavy body count this close to Phoenix,</b>

46
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,540
显而易见，毒品集团的暴力犯罪正在严重升级.
<b>is without a doubt a major escalation for the cartels.</b>

47
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,620
在美国心脏地带发生如此触目惊心的暴行，
<b>There will be pressure in Washington to explain how such a dramatic outrage</b>

48
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,000
想必会给华盛顿方面带来巨大压力.
<b>could happen so deep inside the American heartland.</b>

49
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,600
我们谈论的可能是黑帮地盘火拼的受害者，
<b>We may be talking about the victims of a turfwar,</b>

50
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,560
也可能是被绑架勒索的偷渡者.
<b>or maybe some illegal immigrants who are tied to a ransom,</b>

51
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,920
预计我们得花上数周的时间， 才能辨清这些受害者的身份…
<b>but it will be some weeks before we have a clearer picture on who the victims...</b>

52
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,040
这是怎么回事?
<b>What's goin' on?</b>

53
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,720
不知道
<b>I have no idea.</b>

54
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,480
她领导一支反绑架小组已经有三年了.
<b>She's been leading our kidnap response team for three years.</b>

55
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,120
来这之前她接受的是这方面的培训.
<b>Put her through the grinder since she got here, and she hasn't blinked.</b>

56
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,760
她在一线做事.
<b>She's in the front line.</b>

57
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,690
没人能比凯特更乐意见到那些混蛋被绳之以法.
<b>Nobody's gonna be happier than Kate to see these guys go down.</b>

58
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,540
这么说她是个“正直的小伙伴”?
<b>So, she's a thumper.</b>

59
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,860
包括今天在内她一共部署了五次搜捕行动.
<b>Today was her fifth O.I.S.</b>

60
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,640
- 结果是五个‘零蛋’. - 对于一个新手来说，这结果不算坏
<b>5-and-0, not bad for a rookie. She never worked cases?</b>

61
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,200
她这案子办得怎么样?
<b>She never worked cases?
- 结果是五个‘零蛋’. - 对于一个新手来说，这结果不算坏
5-and-0, not bad for a rookie. She never worked cases?</b>

62
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,400
她这案子办得怎么样?
<b>She never worked cases?</b>

63
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,390
从一开始就屡屡碰壁.
<b>Been kicking doors since day one.
她这案子办得怎么样?
She never worked cases?</b>

64
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,360
从一开始就屡屡碰壁.
<b>Been kicking doors since day one.</b>

65
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,500
她的那个拍档怎么样，干这行多久了?
<b>I like her already. What about the partner? He seen any action?</b>

66
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,380
她干了只有一年半.
<b>He's only been with us 18 months.</b>

67
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,860
他有什么背景?
<b>What's his background?</b>

68
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,020
名牌大学的尖子生.曾经获得去马里兰的奖学金.
<b>He's a sharp kid. ROTC scholarship to Maryland,</b>

69
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,160
还拿到了UNC的一个法律学位.（UNC:北卡罗来纳大学）
<b>did a tour in Iraq, got his law degree from UNC.</b>

70
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,120
虽说是新手，但潜质不错.
<b>He's green, but he's good.</b>

71
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,880
这支队伍里不需要律师，我要这女孩.
<b>No lawyers on this train. Just give me the girl.</b>

72
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,280
你都是照章办事没出漏子吧?
<b>We did this by the book, right?</b>

73
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,800
废话，当然了.
<b>Come on, of course.</b>

74
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,050
- 天! - 怎么了?
<b>- Jesus. - What?</b>

75
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,440
卧槽!
<b>Oh, shit.</b>

76
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,760
凯特，你能进来吗?
<b>Would you step in here, Kate?</b>

77
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,640
今天收获不小，尽管失去了两名探员.
<b>Quite a find today, the loss of two officers notwithstanding.</b>

78
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,080
是的, 长官.
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

79
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,530
关于曼努埃尔·迪亚兹和他的生意，你知道些什么?
<b>How familiar are you with Manuel Diaz's operation?</b>

80
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,640
他的“太阳绿洲”公司这八年来一直从事房地产业务.
<b>His company, Sun Oasis, has 80 or so foreclosure properties.</b>

81
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,080
他还经营着其它的合法企业.
<b>He has other legitimate businesses.</b>

82
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,640
但传闻他和某个墨西哥贩毒集团有关.
<b>But he's rumored to be linked with one of the Mexican cartels.</b>

83
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,970
迪亚兹为一个叫做索诺拉的贩毒集团做事.
<b>Manuel Diaz works for the Sonora Cartel.</b>

84
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,560
他很可能是他们在美国的高级成员之一.
<b>He's most likely their senior member in the United States.</b>

85
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,680
你知道他的兄弟吗?
<b>What do you know about his brother?</b>

86
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,730
我不知道他有一个兄弟
<b>I wasn't aware he had one.</b>

87
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,850
吉尔莫，他兄弟叫做吉尔莫.
<b>Guillermo. His brother's name is Guillermo.</b>

88
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,260
那你知道他的表兄弟之类吗?
<b>Do you know anything about his cousin?</b>

89
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,620
我也不知道，他的档案里没这些记录.
<b>I didn't know he had one of those either. None of that is in his file.</b>

90
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,600
他有个表哥，福斯托·阿拉尔孔.
<b>His cousin is Fausto Alarcon.</b>

91
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,180
我不知道这个人.
<b>I don't know who that is.</b>

92
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,060
没有人知道，他藏起来了
<b>No one does. He's off the grid.</b>

93
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,080
他是索诺拉的第三号人物.
<b>He's number three in the Sonora Cartel.</b>

94
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,490
这些不是我管的事，长官.
<b>This is not my department, sir.</b>

95
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,170
各位，正如我刚才说的.梅瑟没经办过毒品案件
<b>Like I said, Agent Macer doesn't work narcotics.</b>

96
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,440
她一直都在负责绑架案件.
<b>She runs a kidnap response team.</b>

97
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,880
你结婚了吗?
<b>Are you married?</b>

98
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,400
问我结婚了吗?
<b>Am I married?</b>

99
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,370
你有丈夫吗?
<b>Do you have a husband?</b>

100
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,920
离婚了.
<b>Divorced.</b>

101
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,320
孩子呢?
<b>Kids?</b>

102
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,680
没有.
<b>No.</b>

103
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,840
还有别的事吗?
<b>Anything else?</b>

104
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,450
没有了...谢谢，凯特，你可以在外面等一会吗.
<b>No. Thanks, Kate. If you could wait outside, please.</b>

105
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,480
- 什么情况? - 我也不知道.
<b>- Well? - I have no clue.</b>

106
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,240
- 那些家伙是谁? 你知道吗
<b>Who are those people? You know?</b>

107
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,440
- 不知道.
<b>No idea.</b>

108
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,760
非常感谢你们过来，伙计
<b>Thanks for coming in, guys.</b>

109
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,010
凯特，再进来一下.
<b>Will you come back in, Kate?</b>

110
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,760
为了打击迪亚兹背后的贩毒集团，国防部计划成立一支专案小组.
<b>DOJ wants advisors that focus on cartels involved in pursuing Mr. Diaz.</b>

111
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,800
这位是马特·格拉弗，他将担任这个小组的头儿.
<b>This is Matt Graver. He'll be leading the team.</b>

112
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,880
不再针对这些谋杀案进行调查了吗?
<b>Isn't this Phoenix homicide now?</b>

113
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,360
不, 我们打算扩大侦查范围.
<b>No, we're expanding the scope of the investigation a bit.</b>

114
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,340
如果你愿意，可以以联络员的身份加入
<b>You'll act as a liaison.</b>

115
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,480
什么意思?
<b>What does that mean?</b>

116
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,100
他们需要你这种有实战经验的人.
<b>They need an agent with tactical experience, like you.</b>

117
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,460
国务院还招募了一名熟悉毒品领域的顾问过来.
<b>State Department is pulling an agent from the field</b>

118
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,720
专门应对日趋猖獗的的毒品犯罪活动.
<b>that specializes in responding to escalated cartel activity.</b>

119
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
你会成为这个专案小组中的一员.
<b>You'll be part of the team.</b>

120
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,080
你到卢克空军基地去会合.
<b>You'll meet up with them at Luke tomorrow?</b>

121
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,380
明天，中午之前吧.
<b>Day after. Early.</b>

122
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,480
空军基地?
<b>Air Force Base?</b>

123
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,840
是的.我们打算去找吉尔莫.
<b>Yeah, we're gonna go see Guillermo.</b>

124
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,300
迪亚兹的兄弟?
<b>Diaz's brother?</b>

125
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,810
正是此人.
<b>That's the one.</b>

126
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
他在哪?
<b>Where is he?</b>

127
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,920
埃尔帕索.（埃尔帕索：德州西部城市）
<b>He's in the El Paso area.</b>

128
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,880
此行的目的是什么?
<b>What's our objective?</b>

129
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,960
去...火上浇油.
<b>To dramatically overreact.</b>

130
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,320
凯特，这个专案小组是自愿加入的.
<b>Kate, you must volunteer for an inter-agency task force.</b>

131
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,920
考虑好再回答.
<b>Think very hard before you respond.</b>

132
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,850
你愿意加入吗?
<b>You wanna be a part of this?</b>

133
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,160
我们会抓住那些要为今天这件事负责的人吗?
<b>Do we get an opportunity at the men responsible for today?</b>

134
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,520
是真正要为今天这件事负责的人，会的.
<b>The men who were really responsible for today, yeah.</b>

135
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,240
我愿意.
<b>I'll volunteer.</b>

136
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,840
爸爸.
<b>Papa!</b>

137
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,240
- 爸爸，醒醒. - 好了，好了...

138
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,020
爸爸快点，我们要去参加足球比赛了.

139
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,820
- 你要去踢球? - 是啊.

140
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,020
- 真的吗? - 嗯.

141
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,120
- 不... - 真的，今天有比赛.

142
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,570
好吧，这就去吧.

143
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,100
妈妈，爸爸要鸡蛋和咖啡，快点好吗，我们赶时间.

144
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,930
好的宝贝... 我在弄住了.

145
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:51,290
亚利桑那州  卢克空军基地

146
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,580
你对那些家伙得多留心一点.
<b>You keep an eye on that doughy prick with the flip-flops.</b>

147
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,680
我可信不过他们.
<b>Don't trust him.</b>

148
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,980
怎么了，长官？
<b>How you doin', sir?</b>

149
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,320
身份证明.
<b>I.D.'s?</b>

150
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,980
这位女士可以进去，你不行.
<b>She's on the list, but you're not.</b>

151
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,120
搞什么鬼?
<b>Well, what's she supposed to do?</b>

152
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,480
你必须在这里倒车掉头.
<b>I need you to turn this around for me.</b>

153
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,930
没事，没事.
<b>It's fine. It's good.</b>

154
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,260
回来的时候，我会打电话给你
<b>I'll call you when we're headed back.</b>

155
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,520
好吧.
<b>All right.</b>

156
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,740
- 早上好. - 早上好. 我迟到了?
<b>- Morning. - Morning. Am I late?</b>

157
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,280
没，我刚刚降落，这边走.
<b>No, no, no. We just landed. Come on, this way.</b>

158
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,610
那家伙是我的“爪牙”，亚历桑德罗.
<b>My bird dog over there, Alejandro.</b>

159
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,820
他也一起去吗?
<b>We're taking this?</b>

160
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,080
是的，他会是你的最佳拍档.
<b>Yeah. Only the best for you.</b>

161
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,300
国防部的人都是坐私人飞机到处飞的吗，长官?
<b>DOD flies you around in private jets now?</b>

162
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,940
没错，你们也可以搞一台试试.
<b>Yeah. You guys don't have one of these?</b>

163
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,240
真牛逼
<b>Right.</b>

164
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,960
机上有吃的吗?
<b>Is there any food on this flight?</b>

165
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,640
当然，后面那里有花生，想吃的话自己拿.
<b>Some bitchin' peanuts in the back. But it's kind of a self-serve deal.</b>

166
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,000
- 凯特·梅瑟.
<b>Kate Macer.</b>

167
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,600
以前去过华雷斯吗?
<b>Have you been to Juárez before?</b>

168
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,880
没有.我们要去的是埃尔帕索, 不是吗?
<b>No, I... We're goin' to El Paso, right?</b>

169
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,160
没错，管他呢，对吧.
<b>Yeah, amazing. Okay.</b>

170
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,680
你没事吧?
<b>Are you okay?</b>

171
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,600
嗯，我没事.
<b>Yeah. I'm fine.</b>

172
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,280
那个，
<b>So...</b>

173
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,880
是你擅长的吗？
<b>So, this is your specialty?</b>

174
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,170
对付墨西哥贩毒集团.
<b>The cartels in Mexico are your specialty?</b>

175
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,440
是的，是的.
<b>Yeah. Yeah.</b>

176
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,610
有什么事情是我需要了解的吗?
<b>Is there anything I should know?</b>

177
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,840
你这等于是问我，一块手表是怎么工作的?
<b>You're asking me how a watch works.</b>

178
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,520
从现在起，我们得严格按照时间计划进行.
<b>For now, just keep an eye on the time.</b>

179
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,880
好吧.
<b>Okay.</b>

180
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,140
你好吗
<b>How you doin'?</b>

181
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,000
您好！ 你怎么了？
<b>Howdy! How you been?</b>

182
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,160
好了 伙计 你感觉怎样?
<b>Good, buddy. How you feelin'?</b>

183
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,760
憋尿太久，拉的时候有点痛.
<b>Well, when I pee, it burns.</b>

184
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,040
有可能是淋病哦，
<b>Maybe it's gonorrhea.</b>

185
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,090
尿液是什么颜色?
<b>What color is it?</b>

186
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,160
黄中带红.
<b>Yellow with red specks.</b>

187
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,090
这就是血了吧
<b>Red specks or blood?</b>

188
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,720
我真想让国防部的人去看看那些发生在斐济的邪恶阴谋.
<b>I'm tryin' to get DOD to let me look into this conspiracy to sink Fiji.</b>

189
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,920
- 斐济?  - 没错.
<b>- Fiji? - Yeah.</b>

190
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,690
那里有恐怖分子吗.
<b>Leave Fiji alone, terrorists!</b>

191
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,080
要是能多待一两个月，我肯定会把他们全干掉.
<b>Exactly. I figure a month or two over there, we'll get it all worked out.</b>

192
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,120
今天还有谁去?
<b>So, who's goin' over there today?</b>

193
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,460
特警的, 禁毒局的.我几乎给你拉来了一支部队，伙计.
<b>Marshals, DEA... I pulled a team for you, Matt.</b>

194
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,000
我喜欢你用“一支部队”这个词，让我热血沸腾.
<b>Oh, man, I love it when you say "a team." It makes me all warm and fuzzy.</b>

195
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,540
这些精兵强将刚从阿富汗回来.
<b>They're a crack bunch, too. Just rotated back from Afghanistan.</b>

196
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,520
那里面有什么老相识吗?
<b>Where's everybody linkin' up?</b>

197
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,450
A.I.C.（即CIA，美国中央情报局）
<b>A.I.C.</b>

198
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,800
不错，不错，不错.
<b>Good, good, good.</b>

199
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,740
接下来，墨西哥警方会在边境和你们会合.
<b>Mexican Federal Police will meet you at the border,</b>

200
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,650
一起前往当地法院提取犯人，地点在这.
<b>and proceed with you to the courthouse, located here.</b>

201
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,480
这是一次危险性极高的行动.
<b>This is a high-level target.</b>

202
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,780
在你们提取犯人或者押送犯人过境返回的过程中.
<b>The most likely spots for an attempt will be at the exchange,</b>

203
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,400
很可能会遭到袭击.
<b>and at the border crossing on the return.</b>

204
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,920
特警将会加入进来.
<b>The Marshals will enter...</b>

205
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,440
基思，凯文，能起立一下吗?
<b>Kevin, Keith, you wanna stand up?</b>

206
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,540
这两位是来自德州拉雷多的特警.
<b>Now, the Marshals' response team is in Laredo...</b>

207
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,720
我喜欢德州.
<b>Love Texans.</b>

208
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,760
在提取和押运犯人时，
<b>...so our friends from Delta have volunteered to come along,</b>

209
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,530
三角洲特种部队会全程护送你们.
<b>and will escort the Marshals on the exchange.</b>

210
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,920
在座的各位都是行家好手.
<b>And here's the man of the hour.</b>

211
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,930
你们是跟我一起去还是留在这里?
<b>You comin' with or waitin' here?</b>

212
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,620
只要你给我几杆子好枪，我很乐意陪你去那里旅个行.
<b>We'll take the tour with you. Loan us a couple pop guns.</b>

213
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,820
棒极了，那样就是全明星阵容了吧.
<b>All right, this is turnin' into an all-star affair!</b>

214
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,600
基思, 你们还需要其他帮手吗?
<b>Keith, you want another hand on the exchange?</b>

215
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,800
你们这些“小弟弟”?
<b>You sober?</b>

216
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,200
在我们到达那里的时候...
<b>Will be by the time we get there.</b>

217
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,680
如果你吓得手颤抖，我会给你一瓶酒壮壮胆.
<b>Got a bottle in the truck in case your hands get shaky.</b>

218
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,450
我知道你一向都说到做到，基思.
<b>I know I could always count on you, Keith.</b>

219
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,380
任务完成后要啥有啥.  现在，马特.
<b>All right, we'll gear you up as soon as we're done here.</b>

220
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,820
有你坐阵，我们就不用再向三角洲要人了.
<b>Now, Matt, you can be the tip of the spear, and we don't have to rob a guy from Delta.</b>

221
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,900
在转弯拐角之处需要特别留意.
<b>Now, be careful on the turnaround.</b>

222
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,440
这些地方经常会有伏击.
<b>If the Federale's a shooter, it's gonna happen on the turnaround.</b>

223
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,300
三角洲第一小组在车队最前面领航.
<b>Delta's Team One will be the lead vehicle.</b>

224
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,580
三角洲第二小组分作两队，分别护卫押运车和尾车.清楚了吗?
<b>We can divide Team Two between the carry car and the trail vehicle. That okay?</b>

225
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,340
三角洲部队, 请亮明你们的身份.
<b>Good. Now, Delta, if you can identify yourselves,</b>

226
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,360
万一遇到出事的时候，我们就能知道有哪些人躲起来了.
<b>so everyone knows who to hide behind if shit hits the fan.</b>

227
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:28,520
最有可能出事的地方就是当我们过境返回的时候.
<b>The most likely spot for a hit will be at the border crossing on the return.</b>

228
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,400
任何一路上跟着我们的人，任何待在屋子外面的人， 都可能是潜在的袭击者.
<b>Anywhere along the way, anyone not in this room is a potential shooter.</b>

229
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,560
直到我们顺利回到这里，事情才算完成.
<b>The op isn't over until we get back here.</b>

230
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,440
清楚了吗?
<b>Okay?</b>

231
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,280
保持警惕，小心戒备. 千万注意. 现在出发!
<b>Be alert. Be vigilant. And be aware. Let's go.</b>

232
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,120
什么？
<b>What?</b>

233
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,170
嘿!我还以为你在监狱里。
<b>Hey! I thought you were in prison.</b>

234
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,520
他们带我出去。
<b>They took me out.</b>

235
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,360
他们需要有人做这项工作
<b>They needed somebody for this job.</b>

236
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,400
为了防止他们不良的行为？
<b>For good behavior or bad behavior?</b>

237
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,160
你以前去过那里吗?
<b>Have you ever been over there?</b>

238
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,880
我曾经在华雷斯做过事.
<b>I worked in Juárez.</b>

239
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,520
帮禁毒局做事?
<b>For the DEA?</b>

240
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,480
不.
<b>No.</b>

241
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,120
那是帮谁做事?
<b>For who?</b>

242
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,520
帮墨西哥政府.
<b>For Mexico.</b>

243
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,290
我那时候是一名控方律师.
<b>I was a prosecutor.</b>

244
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,930
你不是美国人?
<b>You're not American?</b>

245
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,180
不是.
<b>No.</b>

246
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,690
那你现在帮谁做事?
<b>Who do you work for now?</b>

247
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,200
噢，派我来的地方.
<b>I go where I'm sent.</b>

248
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,200
你是哪里派来的?
<b>Where were you sent from?</b>

249
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,210
卡塔赫纳.
<b>Cartagena.</b>

250
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,520
哥伦比亚.
<b>Colombia.</b>

251
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,680
听着...
<b>Listen...</b>

252
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,330
有些东西不是你们这些美国人能够理解的.
<b>Nothing will make sense to your American ears.</b>

253
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,600
你现在还不明白我们做的事情有何意义.
<b>And you will doubt everything that we do.</b>

254
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,760
但到最后.你一定会明白的.
<b>But in the end, you will understand.</b>

255
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,520
穿上它试试，看看是否合身.
<b>Here, try this on. See if it fits.</b>

256
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,960
他是CIA吗，或者你是吗?
<b>Is he CIA? Are you?</b>

257
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,000
他只是国防部的一个顾问，和我一样.
<b>He's a DOD advisor, just like me.</b>

258
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,340
不, 他不只...
<b>No, he's not.</b>

259
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,280
只需要好好看着亚历桑德罗. 他叫你做什么，你就照做.
<b>Just pay attention to Alejandro. If he says to do somethin', just do it.</b>

260
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,720
我没有被授权来听他的命令,
<b>I'm not authorized to follow orders from Alejandro!</b>

261
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,140
尤其是在墨西哥这里!
<b>Especially in Mexico!</b>

262
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,570
那好，那你留在这吧.
<b>Fine. Then stay here.</b>

263
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,780
可你不想这样，是吧?
<b>But you don't want to, do you?</b>

264
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,640
我只想搞清楚我掺和进了什么事里头.
<b>I just wanna know what I'm getting into.</b>

265
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,180
凯特，是你自告奋勇上了这趟车.
<b>Kate, you volunteered to get on this train because you know</b>

266
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:42,330
你清楚自己对凤凰城的案件有心无力.你面对的是一个操蛋的糟糕局面.
<b>you're doing nothing in Phoenix. You're just sweeping up a fucking mess.</b>

267
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,680
这6个月来，你冒死冲进每一所藏有炸弹的房子.
<b>In six months, every single house you raid will be rigged with explosives.</b>

268
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,260
不就是想抓住那些要对此负责的混蛋吗, “是”还是“不是”?
<b>Do you want to find the guys responsible? Yes or no?</b>

269
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,380
是.
<b>Yes.</b>

270
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,640
- 是!- 是?
<b>- Yes? - Yes!</b>

271
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,050
这就是我们现在开始要做的事.
<b>This is where we start.</b>

272
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,480
穿上它试试.
<b>Try it on.</b>

273
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,930
这里就是
<b>There she is.</b>

274
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,920
野兽之城
<b>The beast.</b>

275
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,810
华雷斯.
<b>Juárez.</b>

276
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,960
知道吗...
<b>You know,</b>

277
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,560
有一次，塔夫特总统去访问迪亚斯总统.
<b>1900s, President Taft went to visit President Díaz.</b>

278
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,200
带了4000个人去保护.
<b>Took 4,000 men with him.</b>

279
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,800
几乎把能带的人都带上了.
<b>And it almost was called off.</b>

280
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,040
有个家伙拿着把枪。
<b>Some guy had a pistol.</b>

281
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,220
直接走过去一枪打爆了他的头.
<b>Was gonna walk right up to Taft and just blow his brains out.</b>

282
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,560
这根本没用.4000个人.
<b>But it was avoided. 4,000 troops!</b>

283
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,170
你认为他觉得够安全了没?
<b>Think he felt safe?</b>

284
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,520
欢迎来到华雷斯.
<b>Welcome to Juárez.</b>

285
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,330
手法不错吧，他们干的这些.
<b>It's brilliant what they do.</b>

286
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,840
当他们把尸体肢解成那样..
<b>When they mutilate a body like that,</b>

287
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,780
就会让人们意识到那些死人肯定惹上不该惹的事.
<b>they make people think they must have been involved,</b>

288
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,920
才会落得如此可怕的下场.
<b>they must have deserved such a death 'cause they did something.</b>

289
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,000
这招的确不错.
<b>It's brilliant what they do.</b>

290
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,400
听见吗?
<b>You hear that?</b>

291
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,640
那可不是放鞭炮.
<b>Those aren't firecrackers.</b>

292
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,680
墨西哥人说那边有个行动，
<b>Mexicans are adjusting our route.</b>

293
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,040
我们得绕路走.大家坚持住.
<b>There's activity ahead, we need to go around. Everyone hold on.</b>

294
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,850
这里不会有事.
<b>Nothing will happen here.</b>

295
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,930
如果他们想搞事，会在边境搞.
<b>They try anything, it will be at the border.</b>

296
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,360
盯紧点这些警察.
<b>Keep an eye out for the State Police.</b>

297
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,520
他们可不一定全是好人.
<b>They're not always the good guys.</b>

298
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,560
发现可疑车辆，左边.
<b>Spotter vehicle, left lane. Left lane!</b>

299
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,320
发现可疑车辆，九点钟方向
<b>Spotter vehicle, nine o'clock.</b>

300
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,450
这些家伙真是脑子进水了.
<b>I'm gettin' a boner.</b>

301
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,720
那是我们的人？
<b>Is that one of ours?</b>

302
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,600
留意右边，留意右边
<b>Watch the right, watch the right.</b>

303
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,490
对方只是一匹独狼
<b>No, that's a lone wolf.</b>

304
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,010
留意屋顶.
<b>Eyes on rooftops.</b>

305
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,480
屋顶没东西.
<b>Nothing.</b>

306
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,920
我在摄像画面里盯着
<b>Rooftops clear.</b>

307
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,400
克里克走过 通道是安全的 先生
<b>Bridge is one klick out. Road is secure. Hotfoot it, gentlemen.</b>

308
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,680
大家都待好了. 边境的探员已经做好交接准备.
<b>Everyone stay in this lane. Our agents at the border are</b>

309
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,280
我们通过挥手 来传递信息 我想他们可以的
<b>waving traffic through to get us over as quickly as they can.</b>

310
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,690
大家保持冷静.
<b>Everyone stay frosty.</b>

311
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,440
好吧，他妈的，这下该怎么办
<b>Okay, it's a fuck-up. What are we gonna do now?</b>

312
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,520
我看到了，前方有车辆抛锚，他们正在解决.
<b>Here's the deal. A car broke down up ahead.</b>

313
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,840
需要花上点时间，全员待命.
<b>It's being sorted out, but it's gonna take a while. Stand by.</b>

314
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,160
拿好你的枪.
<b>Get your service weapon out.</b>

315
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,860
10点钟方向，两个车道以外，红色雪佛兰Impala.
<b>Red Impala, two lanes over, on my ten.</b>

316
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,360
收到，红色雪佛兰Impala，两个车道以外，左边.
<b>Copy that. Red Impala, two lanes left.</b>

317
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,240
收到.
<b>Roger that.</b>

318
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,280
左边，7点钟方向，绿色本田Civci.
<b>Three lanes left. Seven o'clock. Green Civic.</b>

319
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,720
把车窗打开.
<b>Bring your window down.</b>

320
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,080
枪.
<b>Gun.</b>

321
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,920
枪，左边
<b>Gun! Gun left!</b>

322
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,120
这里的规则是怎样?
<b>What are the rules here?</b>

323
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,160
如果他们轻举妄动，我们立刻还击.
<b>We must be engaged to engage.</b>

324
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,280
授予你们下车...和掩护射击的权限.
<b>Permission to get out of the vehicle and set a perimeter?</b>

325
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,780
先待在车里.
<b>Stay in your vehicle.</b>

326
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,040
他们下车，你们才下车.
<b>You can do what they do. If they get out, you get out.</b>

327
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,860
准做好准备.不要让他发现我们
<b>Get ready. They can see our lane clearing.</b>

328
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,400
他出来了 出来了
<b>If it's coming, it's coming now.</b>

329
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,280
行动
<b>Move!</b>

330
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,420
等等，等等..
<b>Wait, wait, wait!</b>

331
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,520
待在车里
<b>Get outta the car.</b>

332
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,440
老天.
<b>Jesus Christ!</b>

333
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,420
别动，再动的话就开枪.

334
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,880
别动!
<b>Don't move!</b>

335
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,160
别别别...
<b>No, no, no, no!</b>

336
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,170
伙计，伙计.

337
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,170
放下武器!

338
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,670
放下!.

339
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,960
嘿朋友! 问你个问题.

340
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,460
你想找死吗?

341
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,930
我们他妈的在干什么?
<b>What the fuck are we doing?</b>

342
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,520
操!
<b>Fuck!</b>

343
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,250
我们清场了.
<b>Lane's clear! The lane's clear!</b>

344
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,440
别看我!
<b>Don't look at me!</b>

345
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:25,280
双手抱头 快点 双手包头
<b>Put your hands behind your head! Go! Hands behind your head!</b>

346
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,840
- 清场! - 这烂摊子我来搞定!
<b>- All clear! - I got this!</b>

347
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,770
走走走
<b>Go, go, go!</b>

348
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,490
走了
<b>Move, move, move!</b>

349
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,120
这事儿肯定会登上所有美国报纸的头条.
<b>This is gonna be on the front page of every newspaper in America.</b>

350
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,560
你错了，这种事连埃尔帕索的报纸都登不上.
<b>No, it won't. It won't even make the papers in El Paso.</b>

351
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,040
知道
<b>Clear!</b>

352
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,340
有点儿疯狂，是吧?
<b>Got a little nutty, huh?</b>

353
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,360
疯狂? 是的!该死的，那是不合法的!
<b>Nutty? Yeah, that was fucking illegal.</b>

354
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,290
你是要打仗吗? 你就是个狗日的，
<b>You wanna start a war? You're a fucking spook!</b>

355
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,840
他也是. 我的意思是 那些他妈的是谁?
<b>And him! I mean, who the fuck is that?</b>

356
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,180
你可以待在这.
<b>Told you, you could stay here.</b>

357
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,300
我要疯了! 那里到处都是平民.
<b>Jesus Christ. You just spray bullets at...</b>

358
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,420
是的 当然是平民 他妈的到处都是平民
<b>Yeah, sure, there's just fucking civilians everywhere.</b>

359
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,340
我不是一个士兵，这不是我该做的.
<b>I'm not a soldier! This is not what I do!</b>

360
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,140
别这么玻璃心，行吗?
<b>Whoa! Don't sell yourself short, all right?</b>

361
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,100
雷吉不在这里，是因为我知道他还没准备好面对这个.
<b>The reason Reggie's home is I know he wasn't ready for this.</b>

362
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,820
但他最好早点做好准备，因为将来也要这样, 凯特.
<b>But he better get ready real quick because this is the future, Kate!</b>

363
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,420
在华雷斯，如果有人胡作非为他们的下场就是这样.
<b>Juárez is what happens when they dig in. This is it!</b>

364
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,500
我他妈的来这里干什么?
<b>What am I doing here?</b>

365
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,780
你来这里，就是要帮我们制造一个混乱局面.
<b>What you're doing here is you're giving us the opportunity</b>

366
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,800
制造混乱 就是这么回事!
<b>to shake the tree and create chaos. That's what this is!</b>

367
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,960
你要像海绵一样吸收你所看到的任何东西.
<b>In the meantime, just sponge everything up you see.</b>

368
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,040
学习! 这就是为什么你要来这里.
<b>Learn! That's why you're here.</b>

369
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,920
吉尔莫.
<b>Guillermo...</b>

370
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,130
你把他灌了一肚子水吗? 你真邪恶.
<b>You're giving him a belly full of water, you devil.</b>

371
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,360
你没想过会被我们抓住吧?
<b>You didn't think we'd get you here, did you?</b>

372
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,860
我不懂说英语.
<b>No hablo Inglés.</b>

373
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,610
不懂说英语?
<b>No hablo Inglés?</b>

374
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,840
那就太坏了. 我喜欢他们说 "我不懂"，杰西.
<b>I love it when they no hablo Inglés.</b>

375
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,170
知道吗，我把你的一个老朋友带来了.
<b>You know, I brought an old buddy of yours.</b>

376
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,640
我敢打赌，你一定懂怎么和他“说话”.
<b>I bet you hablo to him. Yeah.</b>

377
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,480
我不知道原来“幽灵”也会口渴.
<b>I didn't know ghosts got thirsty.</b>

378
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,810
我只知道某个人还活着.
<b>I know someone kept him alive for us.</b>

379
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,360
这种日子可不容易啊.
<b>I doubt it was easy.</b>

380
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,600
这种日子有哪天是容易的呢?
<b>What's easy these days?</b>

381
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,840
对于你所发生的事我很抱歉.
<b>I'm sorry about what happened on the return.</b>

382
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,640
不是我能控制的
<b>I control only what I can.</b>

383
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,640
是吗? 这不是你的过错.
<b>It's not your fault.</b>

384
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,460
- 你妻子怎样? - 她很好.

385
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,460
- 我们有两个儿子. 一个10岁，一个8岁.

386
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:02,090
- 在华雷斯? - 不，在蒙特雷.

387
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,730
那还好点.

388
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,030
嗯，那里治安更好些.

389
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,230
没错.

390
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,200
我听说这里有条隧道.
<b>There's rumors of a tunnel.</b>

391
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,400
连通亚利桑那州.
<b>Fausto's main road into Arizona.</b>

392
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,780
假如..你现在要做的事，是我想的那样...那就是最理想的途径.
<b>If you're doing what I think you're doing, that's the best place to cross.</b>

393
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,160
如果你能找到的话. 不过得尽快，时间不等人.
<b>If you can find it. But time is against you.</b>

394
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,160
机不可失，失不再来.
<b>In three days, nobody will be where they are today.</b>

395
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,780
我们该...?
<b>Shall we?</b>

396
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,010
不，你最好别进去.待会那里面会发生些事情.
<b>No, it's better if you don't. Something happens in that room,</b>

397
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,120
不用我提醒，你没有看到任何事情.
<b>it's easier to say you didn't see anything.</b>

398
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,810
很欣慰看到你仍在坚持战斗.

399
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:42,010
对于发生的事，我真的抱歉.

400
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,260
多保重.

401
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,600
亚历桑德罗，我觉得他肯定记得你.
<b>Well, Alejandro, I think he remembers you.</b>

402
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,810
我先出去.
<b>I'm gonna step out.</b>

403
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,160
蒂米。
<b>Timmy.</b>

404
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,470
再过一会，你就会明白...

405
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,320
“上帝的爱在美国”是什么意思了.

406
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:04,970
不...

407
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,200
你一直看着我也没用.
<b>What do you keep lookin' at me for?</b>

408
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,000
“我不懂说英语”，你忘了吗?
<b>No hablo Inglés, remember?</b>

409
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,200
没有
<b>No, no.</b>

410
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,080
给我根烟行吗?
<b>Can I have one of those?</b>

411
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,080
谢谢
<b>Thank you.</b>

412
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,930
- 喜欢看烟火吗? - 呃?
<b>- You like fireworks? - Huh?</b>

413
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,080
想看些有趣的玩意吗?
<b>Wanna see something cool?</b>

414
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,720
过来.
<b>Come on.</b>

415
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,920
开始了。
<b>Here we go.</b>

416
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,770
看右边那里.
<b>Look right there.</b>

417
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,040
真不敢相信.
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

418
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,020
毒贩各自为政，纷争不息.
<b>That's what happens when you chop the head off a chicken.</b>

419
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,120
嗯.
<b>Yeah.</b>

420
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,690
我看到了.
<b>I can see.</b>

421
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,840
你把他们都集中起来了?
<b>Can you get 'em all in one place?</b>

422
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,130
我刚在凤凰城下机. 我要谈谈，不能再等了.
<b>We just landed back in Phoenix. I'm on the clock, I can't wait.</b>

423
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:32,140
告诉鲍勃，让他在临时区等着.
<b>All right, look, contact Bob Fisks. Have him hold 'em in the staging area.</b>

424
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,700
从这里到图森要多久?
<b>How long does it take to get to Tucson?</b>

425
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,260
两个小时左右.
<b>From here, it's a little over two hours.</b>

426
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:39,280
好，我们争取两个小时之内赶到那.好的.
<b>All right. We'll be there around 2:00. Yeah.</b>

427
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,860
我们现在去图森吗?
<b>Are we going to Tucson?</b>

428
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,140
没错，你可以顺便练习怎样在飞机上睡觉.
<b>Yeah, you gotta learn how to sleep on a plane.</b>

429
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,940
我想你们会需要一辆顺风车.
<b>They let me on the base when you need a ride, don't they?</b>

430
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,060
你还好吗?
<b>You okay?</b>

431
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,090
我也没答你.
<b>And yet I answered.</b>

432
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,800
凯特，
<b>Kate,</b>

433
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,520
你还好吧?
<b>who's that?</b>

434
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,000
我现在要赶去图森.
<b>We're goin' to Tucson.</b>

435
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,800
怎么回事，马特? 为什么把车拦着不给走?
<b>What's the deal, Matt? Why you holdin' up my transport?</b>

436
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,180
别着急，鲍勃. 马上就好.
<b>Don't worry, Bob. We'll be quick.</b>

437
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:44,700
不着急才见鬼了, 差一点我TMD就得订8000美元的披萨才能安抚住这帮人.
<b>How's the auditor gonna react to an $8,000 check to fuckin' Domino's Pizza?</b>

438
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,620
别那么夸张，好吗? 这位是来自FBI的凯特·梅瑟，还有他的拍档
<b>Don't be so dramatic, okay? This is Kate Macer with the FBI.</b>

439
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,320
“他叫啥名字”，她就是这么叫的.
<b>This is her partner, what's-his-name. It was her call.</b>

440
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,360
瞎扯，我可没那么叫过. 能来根烟吗?
<b>It wasn't my call. Have you got another one of those?</b>

441
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,380
抽完了再过去.
<b>Finish it before you get up there.</b>

442
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,480
没问题
<b>No problem.</b>

443
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:05,680
嘿，凯特
<b>Hey, Kate.</b>

444
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,760
在埃尔帕索发生了什么事?
<b>Tell me what happened in El Paso.</b>

445
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,360
我们没去埃尔帕索. 我们去了墨西哥.
<b>We weren't in El Paso. We were in Mexico.</b>

446
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,640
我觉得我们不会按照规程来
<b>I guess we're not following any procedures.</b>

447
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,980
你打算怎么做?
<b>What do you wanna do?</b>

448
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,160
把那些从诺加莱斯来的人挑出来，我们想和他们谈谈.
<b>We want to talk to the people caught around the Nogales area.</b>

449
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,640
好的.那组.
<b>Okay. That group.</b>

450
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:21,010
这组.还有那组.
<b>This group here. And that group.</b>

451
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:25,040
就这样，他们留下来. 其余的可以走了.
<b>Okay. They stay and the rest can go.</b>

452
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,560
约瑟夫!
<b>Josef!</b>

453
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:31,370
注意!..注意!..

454
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:35,460
从诺加莱斯来的，A组，D组，E组

455
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:40,890
A组，D组，E组，留在原地.

456
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:46,230
其余的人上巴士...现在开始!

457
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,680
- 上巴士，动起来! - 马上!
<b>- On buses, moving! - Now!</b>

458
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,520
我们要找什么人?
<b>What are we looking for?</b>

459
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,360
好好看着.
<b>Just keep watching.</b>

460
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:18,600
这组的...

461
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:23,240
你们当中有谁曾经在美国待过?

462
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:30,790
请问一下.

463
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,440
在哪待过?

464
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,920
- 在亚利桑那州. - 亚利桑那?
<b>- In Arizona. - Arizona?</b>

- 他们在哪? - 奇瓦瓦市.

468
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,200
让我看看你的手.

469
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:53,680
- 你有纹身吗? - 没有, 长官.

470
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:55,280
没有吗?

471
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:59,040
- 还有你呢，叫什么名字? - 亚历桑德罗.

472
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:02,190

473
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:06,200

474
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,200

- 你呢你在哪待过? - 亚利桑那州.

476
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,720

<b>- Arizona -? Yes.</b>

477
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,260
跟我说说.我们在做什么？
<b>Talk to me. What are we doing?</b>

478
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,860
我也无法回答你.
<b>I don't have any answers for you.</b>

479
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,380
那我们去打听一下啊.
<b>Let's get some, then.</b>

480
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,020
难道你以为我没问过他们吗?
<b>Do you think I haven't asked these questions?</b>

481
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,100
- 你觉得你能打听出点什么来?
<b>Do you think you can do better?</b>

482
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,180
- 当然.- 那你去吧.
<b>- Yeah. - Go ahead.</b>

483
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,080
马特，能和我聊会吗?
<b>Matt, can we talk for a minute?</b>

484
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,200
怎么了?
<b>What's up?</b>

485
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,840
没什么问题吧?
<b>Everything okay?</b>

486
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,120
你看起来好严肃.
<b>You look very serious.</b>

487
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,580
你对待我们的方式，让我们像瞎子一样.
<b>There's "in the dark" and there's the way you're treating us.</b>

488
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,760
我得搞清楚现在是什么情况.
<b>I want to know the objective or I walk, period.</b>

489
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,800
你可以走的，我可没叫你来这里.我只叫了她
<b>Then go. I didn't ask you to be here. She did.</b>

490
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,480
那我也走.
<b>I walk, too.</b>

491
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,180
- 你们想知道什么? - 所有这一切.
<b>- What do you wanna know? - Everything.</b>

492
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,690
- 操蛋的律师！
<b>Fuckin' lawyers.</b>

493
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,320
好吧.
<b>All right.</b>

494
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,280
吉尔莫
<b>Guillermo</b>

495
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,480
告诉我们在诺加莱斯的东边有条隧道，在萨萨比附近.
<b>told us about a tunnel east of Nogales, near Sasabe.</b>

496
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,740
现在我们要在这群人里面挑选一些熟悉那地区的移民、
<b>Now we're tryin' to find out what areas near there migrants avoid,</b>

497
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,410
或者帮派分子之类的人，帮我们打听出那条隧道.
<b>so we can find the tunnel.</b>

498
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,700
满意了吗?
<b>That better?</b>

499
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,780
吉尔莫?
<b>And Guillermo is...</b>

500
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,860
吉尔莫告诉你那是条运输毒品的隧道对吧.
<b>Guillermo, he just told you where the drug tunnel is?</b>

501
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:33,980
他只是告诉你的？
<b>He just told you?</b>

502
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,740
我们没有其他选择
<b>Guillermo didn't have any other options.</b>

503
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,900
如果把他带回墨西哥去指认 那他很有可能会被灭口.
<b>We send him back across the border, he's a dead man.</b>

504
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,040
现在他还可以在美国监狱里多活30年.
<b>Now he gets to spend the next 30 years in an American prison,</b>

505
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,580
相对安全
<b>in relative safety.</b>

506
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,250
和我们讲实话，伙计.
<b>Just tell us the truth, man.</b>

507
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,360
我们打算对曼努埃尔·迪亚兹做个局，
<b>We are gonna make enough noise</b>

508
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:58,400
让他会被他的老板召回墨西哥去.
<b>that Manuel Diaz is called back to Mexico to see his boss.</b>

509
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,520
这就是实话.
<b>That's the truth.</b>

510
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,760
然后呢?
<b>And then?</b>

511
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,400
然后我们顺藤摸瓜找出他老板躲在哪.
<b>And then we know where his boss is.</b>

512
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:10,360
他叫做“刽子手福斯托·阿拉尔孔”.
<b>His name is Fausto Alarcon El verdugo.</b>

513
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,130
拜他所赐，边境上的每一天...
<b>Every day across that border,</b>

514
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:22,040
都有人被绑架，或者被杀害.
<b>people are kidnapped or killed by his hand or with his blessing.</b>

515
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:28,800
找到了他们，就好比发现了能清除病毒的疫苗.
<b>To find him would be like discovering a vaccine.</b>

516
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,720
你明白这件事的价值所在了吗?
<b>You understand the value of that.</b>

517
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:42,080
好吧，我们懂了. 只是不要让我们再当瞎子.
<b>All right, we're good. Just don't keep us in the dark.</b>

518
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,520
好了.
<b>Great!</b>

519
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,050
原来他们怕黑啊...
<b>You afraid of the dark?</b>

520
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,720
嘿
<b>Hey!</b>

521
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,560
你只需要..哼哼 "全垒打之日".回家去，好好睡个觉.
<b>It's been a humdinger of a day. Go home. Get some rest.</b>

522
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,600
我们会找到另一辆顺风车的.我们明天再见
<b>We'll find our own ride. We'll see you tomorrow!</b>

523
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,860
我只开了100英里
<b>I just drove a hundred fucking miles.</b>

524
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,820
这绝对是操蛋的祝福，相信我.
<b>It's a fucking blessing, trust me.</b>

525
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,980
就是他让你又抽烟了?
<b>Got you smokin' again?</b>

526
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,080
是的.
<b>Yeah.</b>

527
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,560
吉尔莫到底他妈的是谁?
<b>Who the fuck's Guillermo?</b>

528
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:25,900
过来吃东西，准备去上学了.

529
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:41,390
- 爸爸去哪了? - 他去上班了.

530
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:49,790
- 那他几时回来? - 不知道.

531
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,880
得给你一个新文胸，女人.
<b>Gotta get you a new bra, woman.</b>

532
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,570
我要的东西有一张表那么多
<b>The list of things I need.</b>

533
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,680
我是说，一个蕾丝的...
<b>I'm just saying. Some nice lacy somethin'.</b>

534
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,800
好久没人看到过我的文胸了，除了你.
<b>It's been a while since someone's seen me in a bra, except you.</b>

535
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,010
别那样看着我，我不需要你的怜悯.
<b>Oh, God, don't look at me like that. I don't want your pity.</b>

536
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,280
改天去见见伊万吗?
<b>How was seeing Evan the other day?</b>

537
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,340
不知道.
<b>I don't know...</b>

538
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,280
- 不想他? - 说点别的.
<b>- Miss him? - Ask me something else.</b>

539
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,900
我过去遇到过像马特这样的人， 对周围的人讳莫如深，守口如瓶.
<b>I used to see guys like Matt in Iraq. Gotta be careful around these people.</b>

540
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,400
CIA不应该来插手这类案子.
<b>CIA's not supposed to work this side of the fence.</b>

541
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,020
他是国防部的一个顾问
<b>He's a DOD advisor.</b>

542
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,690
你真的信吗?
<b>You really believe that?</b>

543
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,740
你需要有人看着你确保安全，我敢保证他们没有.
<b>You need somebody watching your six, 'cause I promise you they aren't.</b>

544
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,580
你知道吗...
<b>You know,</b>

545
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:51,260
这案子到目前为止我们触及到的只是皮毛.
<b>we're not even scratching the surface doing what we're doing.</b>

546
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,360
一切还在原地踏步.
<b>And they are.</b>

547
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:56,480
那你最好他妈的亮出你的真功夫.
<b>Well, you sure picked the motherfuckers to show us.</b>

548
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,840
暗号是什么?
<b>What's the password?</b>

549
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,200
“傻逼”.
<b>Moron.</b>

550
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:23,050
- 你们不可能通过“洛杉矶骑士”. - 坐这.

551
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,410
不，你们不可能.

552
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:28,270
- 但你能， - 没错，是你的话能行.

553
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:33,830
可是别指望在“土狼”那也能行. 没有女人能通过那里.

554
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,200
这是我们的地盘.
<b>This is our spot.</b>

555
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,080
不行..! 不行...!
<b>No way! No, no.</b>

556
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:45,180
你瞧，你瞧...这里是毒品区.

557
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:49,570
唯一能通过这地方的，只有“骡子”和“肉鸡”.

558
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:53,050
他们只让这些毒品运输者通过他们的隧道.

559
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:57,010
- 因此你不可能像那样通过，对吧? - 你熟悉那片地方吗?

560
00:56:57,190 --> 00:57:01,200
- 我看看... 一直以来那里都是偷渡过境的最佳通道.

561
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:05,270
从这里往86号国道方向走.

562
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:07,410
- 那里有片低洼多水的地方.

563
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,160
能把隧道的位置指出来吗?
<b>Are you getting this?</b>

564
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:19,270
看这，他们把入口藏在一辆破车后面.

565
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:20,970
这里.

566
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,840
那条就是我们要找的路.
<b>That's our way across.</b>

567
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,680
看来吉尔莫说的是真的.
<b>So, Guillermo was tellin' the truth?</b>

568
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,840
好事将近了.
<b>It's gonna be a good day.</b>

569
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,480
凯特，你有什么朋友在凤凰城银行吗?
<b>Hey, Kate. Got any friends at Phoenix SWAT?</b>

570
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,260
有，不过他是负责债务违约这块的
<b>Yeah, we use them in breaches all the time.</b>

571
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,740
我们得找他们帮点忙.
<b>Good, 'cause we're gonna need their help.</b>

572
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:44,860
帮什么?
<b>What for?</b>

573
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,120
我们要让迪亚兹的钱包...狠狠的大出血.
<b>We are gonna fuck with Manuel Diaz's wallet.</b>

574
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:43,080
这女人在帮他洗黑钱，伙计们. 金头发，白色背包的这个.
<b>This is our Smurf, guys. Blonde hair, white purse.</b>

575
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,420
- 你知道“海姆立克急救法”吗? - 噢，知道.
<b>- You know the Heimlich? - Oh, yeah.</b>

576
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:55,380
她先把赃的钱让银行吞进去，再让银行把干净的钱吐出来， 就像“海姆立克急救法”...
<b>She tries to eat that deposit receipt, you Heimlich it right out of her, hear me?</b>

577
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,480
我懂了.
<b>Copy that.</b>

578
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,000
那儿，她要走了. 逮捕他们，泰格
<b>There she goes. All right, go get 'em, tiger.</b>

579
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,280
带着他们。
<b>Take 'em.</b>

580
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:14,420
双手放在方向盘上!

581
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,320
趴下!

582
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,890
不许动！不许动
<b>Hold still! Hold still!</b>

583
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:21,120
不许动!

584
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,000
你要电脑监控吗?
<b>You want bank computers for evidence?</b>

585
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:27,580
不用，只关注钱. 冻结他的所有银行账户.
<b>No, no. Just the money. But freeze all his accounts, everything.</b>

586
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,040
就是用他的狗开的户，我也要你冻结它.
<b>Even if his dog opened an account, I want you to freeze it.</b>

587
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,330
有什么发现?
<b>Who you got?</b>

588
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,200
移动式的洗黑钱者.
<b>Got a mobile money launderer.</b>

589
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,040
收起来.
<b>Pack it up.</b>

590
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,880
起来.
<b>Come on. Come on.</b>

591
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,540
你要一起来吗?
<b>You coming?</b>

592
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:59,660
别进银行.
<b>No, don't go in the bank.</b>

593
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,700
这案子很快就会有突破性进展.
<b>This is something we can actually build a case on.</b>

594
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,580
别进银行，凯特.
<b>Don't go in the bank, Kate!</b>

595
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,400
她现在进银行了.
<b>There you go, and she's goin' in the bank.</b>

596
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,460
这些全都是迪亚兹账户里的?
<b>These are all Manuel Diaz's accounts?</b>

597
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:27,920
没错. 每天现金存款，每笔9000美元.
<b>Yeah. Cash deposits made daily in $9,000 increments.</b>

598
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,260
- 所以银行方面不会报备. - 是的.
<b>- So, it doesn't have to be reported. - That's right.</b>

599
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,620
你能查出这些账户资金的来源吗?
<b>And you can seize that?</b>

600
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:34,980
我已经在做了. 我们要追踪所有这些电汇号码.
<b>I already have. And I'll go through these wire transfer numbers and</b>

601
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,040
并冻结他的账户.
<b>freeze all these accounts as well.</b>

602
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,160
给你.
<b>Here you go.</b>

603
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,890
- 他妈的，太狡猾了. - 怎么了?
<b>- Damn, that's smart. - What?</b>

604
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,680
这是银行授信额度，
<b>This is a bank line of credit.</b>

605
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,980
可以用来支付欠款.
<b>See, you make payments over what you owe,</b>

606
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,760
它不表现为现金流，而是表现为负的贷款余额.
<b>and it doesn't show up as cash, it shows up as a negative loan balance.</b>

607
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:58,680
用这种方式他们永远都不会被银行报备. 不管是IRS还是DEA，这笔钱都是看不见的.
<b>It's never reported to anyone. IRS, DEA... This money is invisible.</b>

608
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,160
他有多少钱?
<b>How much does he have?</b>

609
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,400
看吧.
<b>Take a look.</b>

610
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,050
噢，我的天.
<b>Oh, my God.</b>

611
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,820
他们刚刚看到有1700万美元.
<b>They just seized $17 million.</b>

612
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,580
- 这是个圈套, 凯特. - 什么?
<b>- It's a bogus bust, Kate. - What?</b>

613
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:16,660
你起诉不了他. 这些存款账户不属于任何人.
<b>You can't prosecute it. No one controls who deposits money in an account.</b>

614
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,360
几个月之后律师就会将那些钱收回.
<b>An attorney will have that money back in a few months,</b>

615
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:19,970
已经有很多人吃过这招的亏了.
<b>but a lot of heads will roll before that.</b>

616
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,380
但我们现在仍然可以逮捕迪亚兹，把他关起来...
<b>But we can arrest Manuel for now. We can get him off the street.</b>

617
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,580
- 我们就是要让迪亚兹回到墨西哥，这才是目的.
<b>We gotta get Manuel called back to Mexico. That's the objective...</b>

618
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,360
我们在墨西哥没有司法管辖权.
<b>We have no jurisdiction in Mexico.</b>

619
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,020
- 我们什么都没有，我们现在必须做点什么.
<b>We have nothing. We need to do something now.</b>

620
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,450
总之我们不能逮捕他.
<b>Can't arrest him.</b>

621
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,290
什么?
<b>What?</b>

622
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,600
什么时候?
<b>When?</b>

623
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:57,600
等会.
<b>Wait a minute.</b>

624
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:22,860
每天都有9000美元存进这个账户.
<b>$9,000 is deposited into this account every day in cash,</b>

625
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,120
连续5年.
<b>for five years.</b>

626
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:27,280
这不违法. 这是有违法嫌疑，但真的不违法.
<b>That's not illegal. It's suspect, but it isn't illegal.</b>

627
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,200
我觉得IRS会认为这是违法的.
<b>I think the IRS might think it's illegal.</b>

628
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,260
你想要做什么, 凯特?
<b>What do you want, Kate? What would you like done here?</b>

629
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,780
我想遵照正确的程序来办.
<b>I want to follow some semblance of procedure.</b>

630
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:36,040
那就是我想要的.一起公正公开的司法审判.
<b>That's what I want. To build a prosecutable case.</b>

631
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,500
近两年来, 我们已经对这个地区的
<b>We prosecuted more felony drug cases in this region last year</b>

632
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,200
很多宗严重毒品案件都进行了公正公开的司法审判.
<b>than in the two previous years combined.</b>

633
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,640
但你现在走在街上，可曾有感受到?
<b>Are you feeling that on the street?</b>

634
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,440
感受到哪怕一丁点我们获胜了的氛围?
<b>You getting the vibe that we're winning?</b>

635
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,300
没有.
<b>No.</b>

636
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,380
那你呢?
<b>Do you?</b>

637
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,720
我也没有，长官.
<b>No sir, I don't.</b>

638
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:01,100
借用马特这样的顾问.
<b>Advisors like Matt come in, they stir the pot,</b>

639
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,850
让他们挑起事端, 迫使那些罪犯作出反应.
<b>they cause the criminals to react and make mistakes.</b>

640
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:06,380
从而露出破绽. 这就是在这场斗争中.
<b>That's how we build cases against the individuals</b>

641
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,560
为什么我们会采取和以往不同的办案方法的原因.
<b>that actually make a difference in this fight.</b>

642
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,860
当他们紧张, 当他们不再信任他们的成员.
<b>It's when they're nervous, when they stop trusting their crews,</b>

643
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,900
当他们转移他们的赃款.
<b>when they move their money.</b>

644
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,880
所有的这些，都会给我们创造出打击他们的好机会.
<b>These are all opportunities to strike.</b>

645
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,120
这就是找马特这些人做事的目的.
<b>And that's the purpose of people like Matt.</b>

646
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:22,240
凯特, 这些事并非出自我个人意愿.
<b>Kate, this isn't something that I dreamed up myself.</b>

647
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,940
我并没有权利招募顾问，或者
<b>I don't have the authority to hire advisors,</b>

648
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,660
授权某人加入专案小组，
<b>or authorize joint agency missions,</b>

649
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:31,000
又或者让探员在空军基地乘坐飞机.
<b>or fly agents from Air Force bases.</b>

650
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,500
你明白我的处境吗?
<b>Are you understanding me?</b>

651
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,680
这一切都是由那些
<b>These decisions are made far from here</b>

652
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:41,800
远离这地方的当局者决定的. 而非我们.
<b>by officials elected to office, not appointed to them.</b>

653
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,940
因此如果你担心这是超出法律界限以外的行动，
<b>So, if your fear is operating out of bounds,</b>

654
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:48,930
我现在告诉你,不用担心.
<b>I am telling you, you are not.</b>

655
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,640
在非常地带，用非常手段.
<b>The boundary's been moved.</b>

656
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:55,720
清楚了吗?
<b>Are we clear?</b>

657
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,240
是的，长官.
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

658
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,460
他妈的我要喝个痛快.
<b>I need a fucking drink.</b>

659
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,760
- 想去哪?- 去哪都行.
<b>- Where do you wanna go? - Anywhere.</b>

660
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,140
我先去“放点水”.
<b>I'm gonna go get a table.</b>

661
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,920
- 我猜这一定是为了我.- 谢谢
<b>- I guess it's on me. - Thanks.</b>

662
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,280
- 要点什么? - 两杯啤酒
<b>- What'll it be? - Two beers.</b>

663
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:51,080
好的，马上.
<b>Yes, immediately.</b>

664
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:11,290
给.
<b>give.</b>

665
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:12,720
谢谢
<b>Thank you.</b>

666
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,640
我想抽烟.
<b>I want a cigarette so bad.</b>

667
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:37,960
梅瑟?
<b>Macer?</b>

668
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,970
嗯?
<b>Yeah?</b>

669
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,200
我不喜欢说这个，但我觉得...
<b>I hate to go on about this,</b>

670
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:45,660
你应该不用担心文胸的状况.
<b>but I think the bra situation's the least of your problems.</b>

671
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:46,800
好吧...
<b>Okay...</b>

672
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,760
因为你看来像坨屎.
<b>'Cause you look like shit.</b>

673
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,920
真的. 你看起来像坨屎. 组里的每个人都这么说.
<b>You do. You look like shit. Everybody on the team's talkin' about it.</b>

674
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:54,380
“她曾经也像选秀选手
<b>They're like, "Kate used to be a number one draft pick.</b>

675
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,240
如今看起来却像一坨屎”.
<b>"Now look at her. She looks like fuckin' shit."</b>

676
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,340
你的眉毛也画得一团糟.
<b>Look at you. Your eyebrows are a mess.</b>

677
01:05:58,440 --> 01:05:59,580
不，它们才不!
<b>No, they're not!</b>

678
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:02,140
它们看起来就像毛毛虫，小野兽，请问你们吃什么?
<b>They're like caterpillars, like wild beasts. You're losing weight...</b>

679
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:03,260
我不吃...
<b>I'm eating.</b>

680
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,580
你打算一件T恤衫穿一个星期?
<b>Look at you. What is it, one T-shirt a week?</b>

681
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:08,100
每天都要搞卫生，哈哼?
<b>At least work on your personal hygiene, huh?</b>

682
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,240
你听起来就像我老妈.
<b>You sound like my mother.</b>

683
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:10,720
也许我就是你的老妈.
<b>Maybe I am your mother.</b>

684
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,740
我们先是搞卫生.然后再去逛超市.
<b>First we work on personal hygiene, then we move on to the shopping.</b>

685
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,540
给你买些土豆，是吗? 多吃一点
<b>Get you some potatoes, yeah? Eat some food...</b>

686
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,640
你把我带到哪里了?这里是什么地方?
<b>Where have you taken me? What is this place?</b>

687
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:21,960
一个酒吧.
<b>It's a bar.</b>

688
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:23,280
这里全是牛仔
<b>It's full o' cowboys.</b>

689
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:24,840
我是一个牛仔
<b>I'm a cowboy.</b>

690
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:26,220
你是一个乡巴佬.
<b>You're a redneck.</b>

691
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:29,900
我也是一个乡巴佬. 我娶了老婆.
<b>I'm a redneck. Got a trailer. Got a wife.</b>

692
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,140
你在讲什么?
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

693
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:32,920
我是一个叛徒, 娶了一个老婆，他是我的妹妹.
<b>I got a trailer, I got a wife. She's my sister.</b>

694
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:35,960
嘿 雷吉!
<b>Hey, Reg.</b>

695
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:38,160
- 泰德！ - 发生了什么事？
<b>- Ted! - What's goin' on?</b>

696
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:40,180
- 嘿! 好久不见! - 见到你真好，伙计.
<b>- Long time. How you been? - Yeah, it's good to see you, man.</b>

697
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,420
你过得怎么样?
<b>Good to see you, too. How you been?</b>

698
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:42,660
你们俩在嗨起，哈哼?
<b>Gettin' your groove on, huh?</b>

699
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,260
我们刚坐下，正要开始.
<b>We're just startin'. We just got here.</b>

700
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:47,360
你不帮我介绍一下?
<b>All right. You gonna introduce me, man?</b>

701
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,520
特德，这是凯特·梅瑟. 我的搭档.
<b>Ted, Phoenix PD, Kate, my partner.</b>

702
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:50,840
你好吗? 只要是泰德 就没关系
<b>How you doin'? Just Ted, it's fine.</b>

703
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,020
我看过你玩软球.
<b>I saw you play softball once.</b>

704
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:54,160
软球?
<b>Softball?</b>

705
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,940
她说的是那游戏，特德.
<b>She was at the game, Ted.</b>

706
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,400
游戏?
<b>"The game?"</b>

707
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,760
三振出局, 慢速投球,
<b>Where you struck out in slow-pitch softball.</b>

708
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,610
你玩得挺不错.
<b>You played really, really well.</b>

709
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:03,840
我先回吧台那边.
<b>I appreciate that.</b>

710
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:07,680
待会能请你们再喝一轮吗?
<b>I'm gonna head back to that bar now. Can I get y'all another round?</b>

711
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,160
可以，没问题.
<b>Yeah, sure.</b>

712
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,400
好的
<b>All right.</b>

713
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:13,920
他人不错.
<b>Ted, he's a good guy.</b>

714
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,650
我放下这玩意，马上就好.
<b>Just give me one second, I'll be right with you.</b>

715
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,320
在这里吗? 我准备好了.
<b>All right...</b>

716
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,220
等等，等等.
<b>Just wait, wait a second...</b>

717
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,240
怎么了? 你有点过分了.
<b>What, what? Is it too much?</b>

718
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,240
我需要一点时间想想.
<b>Just wait one minute. I just need a second.</b>

719
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:08,480
抱歉..抱歉...
<b>All right. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</b>

720
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:17,380
嘿 凯特.
<b>Hey, Kate?</b>

721
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:21,040
嘿，过来，别这样.
<b>Hey! Hey, come here, stop, stop, talk to me.</b>

722
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:25,370
我们聊聊，好吗? 放松点.
<b>Just talk to me. Okay? Relax. Okay? Just take it...</b>

723
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:27,130
该死. 凯特，
<b>Whoa, shit! Kate...</b>

724
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:31,120
这是怎么了?别这样.
<b>What is it? What? Stop.</b>

725
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,200
停下来...停下来...
<b>Stop. Stop.</b>

726
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:35,400
你他妈的在做什么?
<b>Shit, what the fuck! What did you...</b>

727
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:38,920
- 不要...- 他妈的你要干什么
<b>- Don't... - What the fuck are you...</b>

728
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:41,560
该死
<b>God damn!</b>

729
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,760
你想杀了我吗? 你他妈的疯了!?
<b>You fuckin' try to shoot me? You fuckin' crazy?</b>

730
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,800
- 停下来! - 让我走.
<b>- Stop that! - Get off me!</b>

731
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:53,360
他妈的...
<b>Fuck that...</b>

732
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,240
该死的 凯特 你他妈的住手
<b>Damn it, Kate! Just fucking stop!</b>

733
01:09:58,720 --> 01:09:59,720
住手
<b>Stop!</b>

734
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:07,560
停下来. 我操
<b>Stop, bitch! Stop! Fuck!</b>

735
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,720
他妈的停下来!
<b>Fuckin' stop!</b>

736
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,640
住手
<b>Stop.</b>

737
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:19,680
妈的
<b>Fuck!</b>

738
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:26,840
这都是你的错. 你想要这么做
<b>This is you, you hear me? You did this. You did this.</b>

739
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:04,160
你拿我当诱饵
<b>You used me as bait.</b>

740
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:07,800
是你把自己当成诱饵.
<b>Nah, you used yourself as bait.</b>

741
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,240
我告诉过你的，别走进银行.
<b>I told you not to go in the bank.</b>

742
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:16,440
你被他盯上了，幸好..歪打正着.
<b>You brought him back here, though. That was smart.</b>

743
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,370
是的, 让我们假装一下我是在引蛇出洞.
<b>Yeah. Love how we're gonna pretend like I planned this.</b>

744
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:22,040
那你的报告就按这么写吧.
<b>Why don't you just write that in your report.</b>

745
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,600
来吧. 这是个好消息.
<b>Come on! This is good news!</b>

746
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,840
很快他们就会把曼努埃尔·迪亚兹召回去.
<b>They're gonna call Manuel back soon.</b>

747
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:30,720
突破性进展就要来了.
<b>Isn't that the point?</b>

748
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,410
我没事，雷吉.
<b>It's okay, Reg.</b>

749
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:51,180
我曾经觉得他是个朋友.
<b>I thought he was a friend.</b>

750
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:52,280
我知道.
<b>I know.</b>

751
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:59,170
- 你想我今晚留下来吗? - 不.我很好
<b>- Want me to stay tonight? - No. I'm good.</b>

752
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,760
- 确定? - 我确定
<b>- You sure? - I'm good.</b>

753
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:08,240
你想我告诉你, 可你他妈的一直在揍我.
<b>How y'all want me to talk to you when you keep fuckin' hittin' me?</b>

754
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:13,180
还有多少像你这样狗日的警界败类被边境对面那些人收买了?
<b>How many other corrupt motherfuckers are you workin' with on this side of the border?</b>

755
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,480
好吧...我...听好了.
<b>All right. Look...</b>

756
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,680
听着, 就像我说的那样.
<b>It's exactly what I told you, all right?</b>

757
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:24,620
他们找上我，让我在这边帮点忙.
<b>They came to me and they wanted details about our case,</b>

758
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:28,160
我答应了, 那是因为我不想有人因此受到伤害.
<b>and yes, I did it, I gave it to them, but I never wanted anybody to get hurt.</b>

759
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:30,020
我再也不会去趟这趟浑水了.
<b>I would have never gotten involved with them pieces of shit</b>

760
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,120
如果为认为有任何...
<b>if I thought that there was any...</b>

761
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:35,840
噢...操...好吧...好吧!
<b>Fuck! Okay! Fuck! Okay!</b>

762
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:40,600
好了，这些不是我们想知道的，特德.
<b>"Okay, okay, okay," is not what we're lookin' for, Ted.</b>

763
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,560
尽管你被揍了个狗血淋头，你仍然帅得一逼.
<b>You know what the beauty is of you being so beat to a pulp?</b>

764
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:49,280
你知道吗，没人会介意你多了几道小抓痕.
<b>'Cause no one's gonna notice a few more scratches.</b>

765
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,210
这里有笔新交易, 特德.
<b>This is a new deal, Ted.</b>

766
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:58,640
我可以决定你的女儿是否能够获得联邦保护.
<b>I'm the one who decides whether your daughter'll get Federal protection,</b>

767
01:12:58,760 --> 01:12:59,760
他妈的
<b>Fuck...</b>

768
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,960
也可以决定把你前妻的地址放到网上.
<b>or whether we post your ex-wife's address on the Internet.</b>

769
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:09,280
我还可以决定，你是被送进一个像密苏里战争营那样的牢房,
<b>I decide whether you go to prison in a work camp in Missouri,</b>

770
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,040
还是一个“杀戮小屋”.
<b>or a kill house like Corcoran.</b>

771
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,200
好的
<b>All right.</b>

772
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,760
何去何从，取决于你，我的朋友.
<b>This is where you negotiate how to survive, my friend.</b>

773
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,840
好吧.你瞧...
<b>Okay. Look...</b>

774
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:27,880
我想要摆脱这一切.
<b>I feel like this whole thing's just gotten away from me...</b>

775
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:33,400
却搞砸了. 现在我真是头都大了.
<b>I fucked up. Okay, I fucked up and I'm in over my fuckin' head right now.</b>

776
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:35,420
我很抱歉
<b>I'm sorry...</b>

777
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,330
该死!让他住手! 该死的!
<b>Fuck it! Get it out! Get it the fuck out!</b>

778
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:43,680
让他住手! 让他住手! 该死的!
<b>Fuck! Get it the fuck out! Get it out!</b>

779
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:46,280
你这混蛋! 操你妈的!
<b>Motherfucker! And fuck you!</b>

780
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:47,840
我操!
<b>Fuck!</b>

781
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:52,130
还有多少官员被黑帮收买了?
<b>How many officers do they have working on the force?</b>

782
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:56,160
任何你想知道的我都告诉你
<b>I'll tell you anything you wanna know.</b>

783
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:59,480
只要你保证 我女儿的安全，好吗?
<b>You just gotta promise me that my daughter's gonna be safe, okay?</b>

784
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,760
你要向我保证.
<b>You make me that promise.</b>

785
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,520
你想听实话吗?
<b>You want the truth?</b>

786
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,040
求你了.
<b>Please.</b>

787
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:12,090
把所有像你这样替黑帮卖命的...
<b>Give me all the names</b>

788
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,880
...狗日的官员的名字，说出来.
<b>of all the motherfuckers they got working on the force.</b>

789
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:17,410
好的..好的.
<b>Okay, okay...</b>

790
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,000
- 好吗? - 好的.
<b>- All right? - Okay...</b>

791
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,720
嗯. 我们从哪个手机开始?
<b>Okay. So, which phone do we start with?</b>

792
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,370
就是那个. 最便宜的
<b>It's in that one. That shitty one.</b>

793
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,480
- 这个最便宜的 ? - 是的.
<b>- That's the shitty one? - Yes, sir!</b>

794
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,120
现在感觉怎样?
<b>How you feelin'?</b>

795
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,360
好点了.
<b>Better.</b>

796
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:53,640
嗯. 你应该开枪射他的.
<b>Well, you should've shot him.</b>

797
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:03,960
我不过是想和我的杀手..来一发...
<b>I just tried to have sex with my hitman.</b>

798
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,160
他并不想杀你.
<b>Nah. He's no assassin.</b>

799
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,540
他只是想试探，你知道了多少.
<b>He just wanted to know what you know.</b>

800
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:14,160
他们的矛头指向我们，不是你.
<b>They're after us, not you.</b>

801
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:20,400
谢谢.
<b>Thank you.</b>

802
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:36,880
你让我想起某个对我而言十分特别的人.
<b>You remind me of someone very special to me.</b>

803
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:47,960
好好睡上一觉.
<b>Get some rest.</b>

804
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:52,240
明天当他们返回墨西哥的时候，
<b>Tomorrow they'll call Manuel Diaz back to Mexico,</b>

805
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,090
我们会将他们连根拔起.
<b>and we'll cut a leg from them.</b>

806
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:45,600
确认目标. 放大图像.
<b>We have eyes on the objective. Can we get a closer visual?</b>

807
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:52,800
东面10米.
<b>Ten meters going by the eastern ridge.</b>

808
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,040
爸爸?
<b>Papa?</b>

809
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:03,930
鸡蛋.

810
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:08,630
- 辣的? - 当然.

811
01:17:17,620 --> 01:17:19,020
你今天要上班吗?

812
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:24,320
晚上.

813
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,420
你要和我去公园踢球吗?

814
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,000
- 踢球? - 是的，爸爸.
<b>- Football? - Sí, Papa.</b>

815
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:37,220
首先得把我的咖啡拿过来.

816
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:44,920
好吧，我们去.

817
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:52,680
不.
<b>No!</b>

818
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:55,670
永远都不准碰它.

819
01:17:57,700 --> 01:17:58,970
懂了吗?

820
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,140
过来吧.
<b>Come on in.</b>

821
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:22,440
美味的饮料？
<b>Tasty beverage?</b>

822
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:25,920
好啦，伙计们...
<b>Okay, boys.</b>

823
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,240
这是怎么回事? 你们计划要干什么?
<b>What's going on? What's the plan?</b>

824
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:30,770
我们要开始狩猎了.
<b>We're going hunting.</b>

825
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:34,620
曼努埃尔·迪亚兹要动身返回墨西哥了.
<b>Looks like Manuel Diaz is being called back to Mexico.</b>

826
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:36,440
我们正在确认.
<b>Just waiting for confirmation.</b>

827
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,170
这就是隧道，看这.
<b>There's the tunnel right there.</b>

828
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:41,240
好吧，听好了。
<b>All right, listen up.</b>

829
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:43,480
让我们理清头绪
<b>Let's clarify the op.</b>

830
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:45,780
我们要确定位置 继续前进
<b>We're gonna drive to location, proceed on foot...</b>

831
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,560
- 你好吗? - 很好，你呢?
<b>- How are you? - Good. How are you?</b>

832
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,680
- 我也是.- 你的脖子没事吧?
<b>- I'm fine. - How's the neck?</b>

833
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:51,160
好多了，谢谢.
<b>It's better, thank you.</b>

834
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:52,920
那就好.
<b>Good, good.</b>

835
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,850
隧道的路线图已经绘制好
<b>These diagrams are based on other tunnels that have been mapped.</b>

836
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:57,720
并非精确地图，仅供参考.
<b>They're for reference only, they're not accurate.</b>

837
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:02,040
当我们抵达边境的时候.会有一个临时落脚点
<b>Once on the Mexican side of the border, there'll be a small staging area,</b>

838
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:04,260
沿着画箭头的方向前往他们的毒品仓库.
<b>then another shaft will lead to the main warehouse</b>

839
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:06,040
事情办妥后返回墨西哥.
<b>and the road that returns to Mexico.</b>

840
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:10,000
那里会有很多毒品骡子吗，我们可不希望以寡敌众.
<b>Once we clear the mules, we don't expect more than a dozen bandits.</b>

841
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:13,140
不，他们用墨西哥警方的车来运送毒品.
<b>No, they use Mexican police for vehicle transport.</b>

842
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:16,080
如果你们在隧道里看到穿警服的，那肯定是跟他们一伙的.
<b>If you see a uniform in the tunnel, consider him a bandit, too.</b>

843
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:19,960
好的...还有其它要讨论的吗?
<b>Okay. You want to discuss ROE?</b>

844
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:21,940
没了，其它的迟些再说.
<b>Nah, we'll save that for later.</b>

845
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:23,040
好的...
<b>Okay.</b>

846
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:26,850
那就准备动身吧，探员们. 我们要声东击西
<b>This is an in and out. We're clearing, placing an agent.</b>

847
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:29,080
我们攻其不备打他们个措手不及.
<b>It's all about creating a diversion.</b>

848
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:31,460
我需要制造一个“大声音”.
<b>Want the mother of all diversions, boys.</b>

849
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:34,640
像国庆节狂欢的声音那么大.
<b>Need a lot of noise. Fourth of July on steroids.</b>

850
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,680
好了，检查好你们的武器. 来吧，伙计们.
<b>All right. Weapons check. Let's go, boys.</b>

851
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:45,040
目标已经确认.
<b>This looks like confirmation.</b>

852
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,620
- 我们得盯紧这辆车. - 没错，必须的.
<b>- I need to fit your guy with a locator. - Yeah, do it.</b>

853
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:58,940
这方面我们可是专家，我们会搞定的.
<b>Those are Special Ops. Are we going in on this?</b>

854
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,620
你们还没有装备吧.
<b>Nah. You guys aren't really dressed for it.</b>

855
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:01,780
为什么你不告诉我们
<b>You didn't fuckin' tell us.</b>

856
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,820
昨天你们俩个哭得像死了爹似的，
<b>Yeah, well, you two went cryin' to Daddy yesterday, and we</b>

857
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,860
- 所以没告诉你们.- 给我一个突破口
<b>- don't want Daddy to know everything. - Give me a fucking break!</b>

858
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:07,200
我去给你们拿些别的装备.
<b>All right, we'll get you some extra gear.</b>

859
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:08,660
我们的装备放在车里.
<b>We have tac gear in the car.</b>

860
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,220
太棒了，那我们就抓紧时间速战速决吧.
<b>All right. Good. You guys will hang back when we get there, okay?</b>

861
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:12,320
为什么叫我们去?
<b>Then why are we going?</b>

862
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,180
因为如果没有其他政府机构的人随行，CIA不能在美国国内合法行动.
<b>'Cause CIA can't operate within US borders</b>

863
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,600
他们在国内没有连接点
<b>without a domestic agency attached.</b>

864
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:22,680
我说过你们是有用的.
<b>I told you you'd be useful.</b>

865
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,360
所以这就是我们在这里原因.
<b>So, that's it. That's why I'm here.</b>

866
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:28,960
是的，完全正确.
<b>Yeah, that's it.</b>

867
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:31,050
这就是你们在这里的原因.
<b>That's why you're here.</b>

868
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,970
如果发现毒品，记得全部没收.
<b>Hey, we find any drugs, you guys get to confiscate 'em.</b>

869
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:36,730
这将会是美妙的一天.
<b>It's gonna be a big day.</b>

870
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,120
我简直不敢相信.
<b>Un-fuckin' real!</b>

871
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:50,380
正面和背面
<b>Front and back.</b>

872
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:54,500
凯特，算了. 让他们自己去折腾. 他们只是在利用我们.
<b>Kate, come on. Fuck these people, man. They've been using us from the beginning.</b>

873
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:55,740
我们没必要跟着去.
<b>We don't have to do this.</b>

874
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,180
我必须搞清楚整件事.
<b>I need to know what they used us for.</b>

875
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,200
- 那已经无所谓了. - 有所谓！
<b>- Doesn't matter what! - Yes, it does!</b>

876
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:03,760
别这样. 我们离开这，让他们全都见鬼去吧.
<b>I say we walk and make them eat this whole fucked-up operation.</b>

877
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,160
不，我必须搞清楚.
<b>No. I have to know.</b>

878
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:17,780
目标车辆，黑色奔驰，车牌号RIN31B7.
<b>Black Mercedes... Plate number: Romeo-India-November-</b>

879
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:22,090
正在往东南方向行驶.
<b>three-one-Bravo-seven. Heading south by southeast.</b>

880
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:35,920
在哪?
<b>Where?</b>

881
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:38,680
知道了.
<b>Okay.</b>

882
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:41,920
我们得快点赶到隧道.
<b>We gotta hit the tunnel the minute we get on the ground.</b>

883
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:44,920
迫不及待了，哈?
<b>Pretty exciting, huh?</b>

884
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,160
目标地点在哪?
<b>What is the target's location?</b>

885
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:02,840
诺加莱斯南面14公里. 往西走.
<b>14 miles south of Nogales heading west rapidly.</b>

886
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:16,880
打开保险栓. 枪口朝下.
<b>Keep your fuckin' safeties on, barrels pointed down.</b>

887
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:18,880
待在后面，
<b>Stay in the back.</b>

888
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:22,530
别乱开枪.  清楚了吗?
<b>Don't shoot anyone on my fuckin' team. Right?</b>

889
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:56,920
检查装备.
<b>Gear check?</b>

890
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:01,300
检查热像仪.
<b>Thermal camera check.</b>

891
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:02,940
检查夜视镜.
<b>Night vision goggles check.</b>

892
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:04,580
保持打开状态.
<b>Get those guys.</b>

893
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:06,090
你带A队，我带B队.
<b>Wanna take Alpha squad, I'll take B squad?</b>

894
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:08,160
- 就按照你说的 开始吧 - 行动吧 孩子们
<b>- You got it. Let's do it. - Let's go, boys.</b>

895
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:07,850
50米 三点钟方向
<b>Fifty meters. Your three o'clock, Alpha.</b>

896
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:26,440
已接近目标.
<b>Stand by. Getting close to objective.</b>

897
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:38,640
A队，B队，注意. 前方12米.
<b>Alpha, Bravo, be advised. 12 meters straight ahead.</b>

898
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:05,320
继续前进，悄悄溜进去，直至找到仓库中心.
<b>All right, we need to boogie and we need to do it quiet till we find the center.</b>

899
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,900
注意别发出声音.
<b>Draw the fighters to you and make some noise.</b>

900
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,040
别跟着我，我能应付.
<b>Don't follow me. I'll be fine.</b>

901
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:12,960
攻击规则是怎样?
<b>What are the rules of engagement?</b>

902
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:16,720
尽情开火，我的伙计.
<b>Weapons free, my friend. Weapons free.</b>

903
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:19,120
尽情开火，小家伙们.
<b>Weapons free, boys.</b>

904
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:20,920
祝好运
<b>Good luck.</b>

905
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:10,240
天哪
<b>Oh, God!</b>

906
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,250
- 你还好吗? - 我没事.
<b>- You okay? - My gun!</b>

907
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,400
跟在我后面.
<b>Leave it. Stay on my six.</b>

908
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:04,390
快点！快点！

909
01:31:06,490 --> 01:31:09,760
快来帮忙.

910
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:19,690
- 把钥匙给我. - 不行.

911
01:31:19,890 --> 01:31:21,390
- 把钥匙给我! - 冷静！

912
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,720
把手举起来!

913
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:26,720
转过身去!

914
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:33,220
麦德林?

915
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:35,920
别动!
<b>Freeze!</b>

916
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,500
放开他.
<b>Step away from him.</b>

917
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:40,740
把枪放下. 放开他.
<b>Put that down.</b>

918
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:42,720
我是认真的 离他远点
<b>I mean it! Move away from him right now!</b>

919
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:51,920
不要再拿枪对着我.
<b>Don't ever point a weapon at me again.</b>

920
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:55,520
喘口气，然后回隧道里去.
<b>Catch your breath. Then get back up there.</b>

921
01:32:21,710 --> 01:32:24,410
把你的手放在方向盘上!

922
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,810
我过去了. 你知道我的方位吗?
<b>I am through. Do you have my location?</b>

923
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:34,600
知道. 我在看着你. 目标在你的东北方向.
<b>Roger, we have you. Target is east and north of you.</b>

924
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:39,520
17号国道. 可以从56号国道往东去拦截他.
<b>Looks like Highway 56 to 17. Will intercept him if he stays on 17.</b>

925
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:41,960
2队 56号国道拦截
<b>Go east on 56 off Highway 2.</b>

926
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:43,640
收到.
<b>Wilco.</b>

927
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:49,330
- 你叫什么名字? - 西尔维奥.

928
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:52,930
西尔维奥，把车开上56号国道.

929
01:32:55,550 --> 01:32:56,700
我有个儿子.

930
01:32:58,420 --> 01:33:01,120
现在你所做的一切都是为了你的家人.

931
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:04,900
他那边怎样吗?
<b>Is he through yet?</b>

932
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,720
我们已经把GPS传送过去了.
<b>We have joy. GPS is transmitting. Audio is transmitting.</b>

933
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:14,850
来了场“扫荡战”啊，朋友们.
<b>That was a clean, clean fucking op, my friend.</b>

934
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,680
除掉了两个混蛋。
<b>Except for these two assholes.</b>

935
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:19,420
那么 你最好逃到海外 其他的不用你管
<b>Well, you're better overseas. You don't have to babysit.</b>

936
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:20,600
凯特在哪?
<b>Where's Kate?</b>

937
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,520
我猜是你带的路.
<b>I thought she was with you.</b>

938
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:24,920
我们得回去找她
<b>We gotta go back.</b>

939
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:28,200
他妈的！小家伙们，我们搞丢了一个人，走吧.
<b>Shit. Boys, we're missin' one. Let's go.</b>

940
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:37,720
嘿
<b>Hey!</b>

941
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:46,520
坐下，帅哥! 别多事!
<b>Just lay back, baby. Let it happen.</b>

942
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:53,450
够了! 停下!
<b>Stop! Stop!</b>

943
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:55,540
放开我
<b>Get off me!</b>

944
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:57,290
停下! 停下! 请别这样!
<b>Stop moving! Stop!</b>

945
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:03,040
停下来!
<b>Stop it.</b>

946
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:06,440
冷静点! 冷静点!
<b>Just relax. Just relax.</b>

947
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:10,780
好了吗? 坐下来.
<b>All right? You gonna stay there?</b>

948
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:12,560
能安静点吗?
<b>Are you gonna stay there?</b>

949
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:28,000
好了.
<b>All right.</b>

950
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:31,240
放松点了吗.
<b>Now, you listen.</b>

951
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:38,080
你走错了隧道.
<b>You went up the wrong tunnel.</b>

952
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:44,240
你看到了你不该看到的东西.
<b>You saw things you shouldn't have seen.</b>

953
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:50,280
麦德林是什么意思?
<b>What is Medellín?</b>

954
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:52,480
麦德林?
<b>Medellín?</b>

955
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:59,480
麦德林是指一个时刻，（麦德林：哥伦比亚贩毒集团）
<b>Medellín refers to a time</b>

956
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:04,280
当由他们来垄断所有毒品贸易的时候，
<b>when one group controlled every aspect of the drug trade,</b>

957
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:08,720
更有利于建立起一套便于我们掌控的秩序.
<b>providing a measure of order that we could control.</b>

958
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:15,560
减少帮派仇杀和暴力犯罪，让毒品世界安定有序.
<b>And until somebody finds a way to convince 20% of the population</b>

959
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:18,120
直到有朝一日不再有人吸食那些狗屎东西.
<b>to stop snorting and smoking that shit,</b>

960
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,640
秩序是我们所能祈求的最好手段.
<b>order's the best we can hope for.</b>

961
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:27,860
你应该看到了
<b>And what you saw up there,</b>

962
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:31,000
亚历桑德罗正是他们派来构建这个秩序的.
<b>was Alejandro working toward returning that order.</b>

963
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:37,640
亚历桑德罗他妈的在帮哥伦比亚贩毒集团做事.
<b>Alejandro works for the fucking Colombian Cartel.</b>

964
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:43,560
帮我们的敌人做事.
<b>He works for the competition.</b>

965
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:46,360
亚历桑德罗可以帮任何人做事.
<b>Alejandro works for anyone</b>

966
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:49,040
只要有人找他 他就会为谁做事
<b>who will point him toward the people who made him.</b>

967
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,580
我们...
<b>Us.</b>

968
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:54,680
他们...
<b>Them.</b>

969
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:58,000
只要能帮他抓住那个...
<b>Anyone who will turn him loose.</b>

970
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:04,560
把他妻子的头砍下来、
<b>So, he can get the person that cut off his wife's head,</b>

971
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:09,050
并且把他女儿扔进一桶硫酸里面的人.
<b>and threw his daughter into a vat of acid.</b>

972
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:14,200
是的...
<b>Yeah.</b>

973
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:18,840
我和他不过是互相利用.
<b>That's what we're dealing with.</b>

974
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:25,080
你不能那么做.
<b>You can't do this.</b>

975
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:28,800
你不能.
<b>You can't.</b>

976
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:35,100
我很确定你们这是在做黑白勾结借刀杀人的勾当.
<b>I'm sure as shit not the person you're gonna hide it all behind.</b>

977
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:36,440
现在，试着放轻松点
<b>You need to just take a breath.</b>

978
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:37,960
我他妈的要说出来.
<b>I'm gonna fuckin' talk.</b>

979
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:39,960
- 不，你不会的. - 我会的.
<b>- No, you're not. - Yeah.</b>

980
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:47,320
我要把你们的所作所为公诸于众.
<b>I'm gonna tell everyone what you did.</b>

981
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:54,480
你这么做可就太不明智了
<b>That would be a major mistake.</b>

982
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:22,480
目标在我的前方吗? 没错
<b>Is that the target up ahead? Confirm.</b>

983
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:28,840
黑色奔驰就在你前方60米.
<b>Roger that. Black Mercedes, 60 meters ahead.</b>

984
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:32,400
西尔维奥，
<b>Silvio...</b>

985
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:34,500
再快点.

986
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:38,540
现在，打开警灯，

987
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:41,840
你就快拦下那辆车了.

988
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:53,490
你这个混蛋!
<b>This motherfucker...</b>

989
01:38:02,470 --> 01:38:05,150
太好了.

990
01:38:25,850 --> 01:38:29,750
- 打开扬声器，叫他下车.

991
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,940
下车.

992
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:47,310
再叫.

993
01:38:49,030 --> 01:38:50,670
从你的车里滚出来!

994
01:38:57,850 --> 01:39:00,490
叫他打开外套，然后转身.

995
01:39:01,570 --> 01:39:03,430
打开外套，然后转身.

996
01:39:05,510 --> 01:39:07,370
你知道我是谁吗?

997
01:39:08,180 --> 01:39:09,860
让他知道，他最好乖乖照办.

998
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:11,760
我操你个狗日的.

999
01:39:13,270 --> 01:39:15,570
打开外套，然后转身.

1000
01:39:18,930 --> 01:39:21,790
- 叫他把枪扔掉. - 把枪扔掉!

1001
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:31,780
你真是一个好警察，西尔维奥.

1002
01:39:34,540 --> 01:39:36,170
现在到你下车.

1003
01:39:39,250 --> 01:39:41,250
下车，西尔维奥.

1004
01:40:00,150 --> 01:40:02,720
你要干什么?

1005
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:22,800
别过来，狗日的! 你知道我是谁吗?

1006
01:40:23,010 --> 01:40:26,350
- 我是一个黑帮老大! - 趴在地上! 趴在地上!

1007
01:40:34,490 --> 01:40:35,930
是的, 我知道你是谁.

1008
01:40:38,210 --> 01:40:40,190
你是个谎话连篇、

1009
01:40:40,390 --> 01:40:42,100
一肚子坏水的人.

1010
01:40:43,390 --> 01:40:48,470
现在，你该去和你的老板见个面了.

1011
01:40:48,770 --> 01:40:52,070
起来!

1012
01:40:55,190 --> 01:40:56,370
起来!

1013
01:40:58,040 --> 01:41:03,170
如果你敢轻举妄动，你的女儿就会被20个男人轮奸致死.

1014
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:06,410
转过身来.

1015
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:15,110
上车.

1016
01:41:48,020 --> 01:41:50,960
- 我是曼努埃尔·迪亚兹. - 我认识你.

1017
01:41:51,950 --> 01:41:53,380
是曼努埃尔...核对过了.

1018
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:02,460
你想去他家做什么?
<b>What happens when we get to the house?</b>

1019
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:04,800
在门口把车停下，得下车了.
<b>You'll stop the car, I'll get out.</b>

1020
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:08,690
我惹到什么事了?
<b>What will happen to me?</b>

1021
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:11,440
低下头.
<b>Slow it down.</b>

1022
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:45,490
迪亚兹先生?

1023
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:04,920
还有6个.
<b>Six remain.</b>

1024
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:08,160
我们关闭通讯了.
<b>We're going blind.</b>

1025
01:44:18,390 --> 01:44:19,450
胃口不错嘛.

1026
01:44:22,850 --> 01:44:26,490
继续坐着，不然他会杀了我们.

1027
01:44:27,640 --> 01:44:30,070
这些孩子听得懂英语吗?

1028
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:31,360
不.
<b>No.</b>

1029
01:44:32,370 --> 01:44:34,280
那我们用英语说.

1030
01:44:36,870 --> 01:44:38,530
继续吃，继续吃.

1031
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:58,930
每一晚，有多少家庭因你而家破人亡.
<b>Every night you have families killed.</b>

1032
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:03,600
而你，却在这里安享晚餐.
<b>And yet, here you dine.</b>

1033
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:08,280
今晚会有些不同.
<b>Tonight should be no different.</b>

1034
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:20,340
继续吃.

1035
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:39,000
那些派你来这里的人
<b>Do you think the people that sent you here</b>

1036
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:40,680
他们和我又有什么不同?
<b>are any different?</b>

1037
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:46,680
你知道从你身上我看到了什么吗?
<b>Who do you think we learned it from?</b>

1038
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,360
一个贪婪的律师.
<b>The grieving lawyer...</b>

1039
01:45:57,120 --> 01:46:01,600
你的妻子...她会为你现在这个样子感到骄傲吗?
<b>Your wife, you think she'd be proud of what you've become?</b>

1040
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:10,360
别忘了我的女儿.
<b>Don't forget about my daughter.</b>

1041
01:46:15,270 --> 01:46:19,480
是的，你的女儿.

1042
01:46:24,780 --> 01:46:26,320
你我之间并不是私人恩怨.

1043
01:46:33,410 --> 01:46:35,280
对我来说，是.

1044
01:46:43,320 --> 01:46:44,650
别伤害我的儿子.
<b>Not in front of my boys.</b>

1045
01:46:58,110 --> 01:47:00,760
是时候去接受“上帝的拥抱”了.

1046
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:24,210
继续，用完你的晚餐.
<b>Go ahead and finish your meal.</b>

1047
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:27,760
我们最好别站在阳台上聊，凯特.
<b>I would recommend not standing on balconies for a while, Kate.</b>

1048
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,120
坐下吧.
<b>Sit down.</b>

1049
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:30,640
你看起来像个担惊受怕的小女孩.
<b>You look like a little girl when you're scared.</b>

1050
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:54,890
你让我想起我那失去了的女儿.
