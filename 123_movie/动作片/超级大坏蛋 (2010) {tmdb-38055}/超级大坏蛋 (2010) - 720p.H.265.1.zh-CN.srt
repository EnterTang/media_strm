5
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,840
这就是我的一天
Here's my day,so far.

6
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,920
蹲过监狱 失去我爱的女孩 还被臭打了一顿
Went to jail,lost the girl of my dreams and got my butt kicked.

7
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,150
很好
Pretty good.

8
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,770
情况可能会更糟糕
Still,things could be a lot worse.

9
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,660
对了 我马上要摔死了
Oh,that's right,I'm falling to my death.

10
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,810
不是吧
Guess they can't.

11
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,430
你会问 这是怎么回事?
How did it all come to this,you ask?

12
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,440
我的结局在开始就被注定
My end starts at the beginning.

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,660
从出生开始
The very beginning.

14
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,070
没错 那就是我
Yes,that's me.

15
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,700
我有过短暂但正常的"童"年
I had a fairly standard childhood.

16
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,650
我出身在一个通常所说的 破碎的家庭
I came from what you might call,a broken home.

17
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,060
破碎是字面上的
Literally,broken.

18
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,280
出生八天后就再也没见过父母
I was eight days old and still living with my parents.

19
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,330
有够悲催的吧?
How sad is that?

20
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,820
命运齿轮开始转动
Clearly it was time to move on.

21
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,070
这是Minion 它会照顾你
Here is your,Minion,he will take care of you.

22
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,830
拿好你的奶嘴
And here is your binkie.

23
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,050
你命中注定会...
You are destined for ...

24
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,860
我没听清最后半句
I didn't quite hear that last part.

25
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,500
貌似很重要
But it sounded important.

26
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,230
命中注定 干什么?
Destined for,what?

27
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,020
我出发去寻找命运
I set out to find my destiny.

28
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,690
看来另一个来自蓝宝象限的孩子也这么想
Turns out a kid from the Blaupunkt quadrant had the exact same idea.

29
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,900
那天我遇见 "比别人都强" 先生
That was the day I met,Mr.Goody-two-shoes.

30
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,330
咱们的最佳对手竞争拉开了序幕
And our glorious rivalry,was born!

31
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,440
啊 这就是我的命运?
Could this be what I was destined for?

32
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,320
如梦如幻的奢华生活?
A dream life filled with luxury?

33
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,620
显然不是
Apparently not.

34
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,510
就连命运也挑喜欢的
Even fate picks its favorites.

35
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,480
没什么大不了
No big deal.

36
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,840
一个截然不同的未来等着我
A much different fate awaited me.

37
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,100
是小宝宝哎
A baby.

38
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,740
考虑太周到了
How thoughtful.

39
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,130
没错 我看见他就想起你
Oh yes,yes.I saw it and thought of you.

40
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,920
总算有个小地方是我家了
Luckily I found a lovely little place to call home.

41
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,350
我们可以养他吗?
Can we keep it?

42
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,410
那里教我什么是对...
A place that taught me the differences between right...

43
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,140
...什么是错
...and wrong.

44
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,100
而 "比别人都强" 先生
Mr.Goody-Two-Shoes on the other hand,

45
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,670
衣来伸手 饭来张口
had life handed to him on a silver platter.

46
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,100
咱家的宝宝会飞哎
Our baby can fly.

47
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,630
没错 你的都是最好的 亲爱的
Yes,yes.Nothing but the best for you,Darling.

48
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:14,030
他有飞行力 刀枪不入 发型也不错
The power of flight,invulnerability,and great hair.

49
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,940
但有项我比他强的多
But I had something far,far greater,

50
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,570
那就是聪明才智
My amazing intellect.

51
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,750
我能把犯罪工具造得出神入化
A knack for building objects of mayhem.

52
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,110
几年后 因为表现良好
After a few years,and with some time off for good behavior.

53
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,430
我被允许上学来改造自己
I was given an opportunity to better myself through learning.

54
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,130
那个奇怪的地方叫学 "笑"
At a strange place called shh-ool.

55
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,540
在那里我又遇到了 "比别人都强" 先生
It was there that I once again ran into Mr.Goody-Two-Shoes.

56
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,640
显然他已经有N个没脑子的仰慕者了
He had already amassed a gigantic army of soft-headed groupies.

57
00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:00,080
他靠生动表演和香喷喷的米花 讨大家喜欢
He bought their affections with showmanship,and extravagant gifts of deliciousness.

58
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:07,040
哼 看我的 "爆玉米花" 让这群呆子大吃一惊
So I too would make this 'popped-corn' and win over those mindless dregs.

59
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,060
熄灯了!
Lights out!

60
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,530
那次我学到了艰难的一课
That's when I learned a very hard lesson.

61
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,360
英雄生来满载赞扬和奉承
Good receives all the praise and adulation.

62
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,390
坏蛋就活该面壁思过
While evil is sent to quiet time in the corner.

63
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,060
于是我注定无法跟别人相处
So a fitting end wasn't really an option.

64
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,700
当他们在学可爱小蜘蛛时
While they were learning the itsy bitsy spider.

65
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,420
我学会怎么给活物脱水
I learned how to dehydrate animate objects.

66
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,380
和怎样任意再水化它们
and rehydrate them at will.

67
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:53,460
有时感觉只有Minion和我在一起 与全世界为敌
Some days it felt like it was just me and Minion,against the world.

68
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,610
不管怎么努力
No matter how hard I tried.

69
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,800
我永远都不合群
I was always the odd man out.

70
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,680
是剩下的那个
The last one picked.

71
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,210
永远一团糟 是害群之马
The screw-up,the black sheep.

72
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,460
是不良少年
The bad boy.

73
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,310
哦!
Oh!

74
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,490
这就是我的命运?
Was this my destiny?

75
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:22,540
等等!也许没错
Wait!Maybe it was.

76
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,350
当坏蛋不就是我最擅长的吗
Being bad is the one thing I'm good at.

77
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,250
我恍然大悟
Then it hit me.

78
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,860
如果我是个坏孩子
If I was the bad boy.

79
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,890
我就要坏到彻底
Then I was going to be the baddest boy of them all.

80
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,780
我注定会成为超级大坏蛋
I was destined to be a super villain.

81
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,130
我们注定是对手
And we were destined to be rivals.

82
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,200
命运就这样决定了
The die had been cast.

83
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,470
我的永恒史诗 毕生事业就此拉开序幕
And so began an enduring epic,life long career.

84
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,710
我爱这项事业
And I loved it.

85
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,190
我们的战斗很快变得越来越复杂
Our battles quickly got more elaborate.

86
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,940
他赢几次 我也不甘示弱
He would win some,I would almost win others.

87
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,720
他有个大名 都市侠
He took the name,Metro Man.

88
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,920
大都会守卫者
Defender of Montrosity.

89
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,640
我的名字呢 就谦卑多了
I decided to pick something a little more humble.

90
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:09,710
超级大坏蛋
Megamind.

91
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,610
史上最帅犯罪天才 精通各种恶行
Incredibly handsome criminal genius,and master of all villainy.

92
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,370
下班了再看 开门
Read on your own time.Open up.

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
嗨
Hey!

94
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,050
嘘
BOO!!

95
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,250
早上好 典狱长
Oh,good morning,Warden.

96
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,890
好消息哦 我改过自新了
Great news,I'm a changed man.

97
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,940
作为可靠市民 我可以重返社会了
And I'm ready to re-enter society as a solid citizen.

98
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,690
你是个罪犯 而且永远是个罪犯
You're a villain,and you'll always be a villain.

99
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,060
你根本没有改过
You'll never change.

100
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,670
也就别想着离开
And you'll never leave.

101
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:57,620
- 你真搞笑 - 有人给你邮了份礼物
-You're fun. - You got a present in the mail.

102
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,280
是小狗吗?
Is it a puppy?

103
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:04,020
都市侠给你的 "珍惜你85次无期徒刑的每分每秒吧"
From Metro Man.To count every second of your 85 life sentences.

104
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:07,200
真搞笑 没想到都市侠也会落井下石
That's funny,never thought Metro Man was the gloating type.

105
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,080
但他品位确实不错
Oh but he does have nice taste.

106
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,480
我帮你保管吧
I think I'll keep it.

107
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,500
能不能别再拖时间了?
Any chance you could give me the time?

108
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,800
今天都市侠博物馆开张 我可不想迟到
I don't want to be late for the opening of the Metro Man museum.

109
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,420
哦不 看来你要错过了
Oh no,looks like you're gonna miss it.

110
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,510
错过好几千年哪
By several thousand years.

111
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,870
噢 是吗?
Oh,am I?

112
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,130
大都会市民们 都市侠日快乐
Happy Metro Man day,Metro City.

113
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:40,130
今日天朗气清 市中心整洁有序 我们即将迎来一位绅士的光临
It's a beautiful day in beautiful downtown where we're here to honor a beautiful man.

114
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,900
都市侠
Metro Man.

115
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,280
他的心胸似海洋 但更宽广
His heart is an ocean that's inside a bigger ocean.

116
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,580
这些年 他的超级视力一直守卫着我们
For years he's been watching us with his super-vision.

117
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,530
超能力一直解救我们 博爱之心也关照我们
Saving us with his super strength,and caring for us with his super heart.

118
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,170
现在是我们回报他的时候了
Now it's our turn to give something back.

119
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:02,150
这里是Roxanne Ritchi为您 在都市侠博物馆落成典礼发回现场报道
This is Roxanne Ritchi reporting live,from the dedication of the Metro Man Museum.

120
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,040
刚才他们让你在广播里念的那一段
Wow,okay,the stuff they make you read on the air.

121
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,430
真难以置信 都疯了吧
That's unfreaking believable,it's crazy.

122
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,250
那是我自己写的 Hal
I wrote that piece myself,Hal.

123
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,390
其实我想说的是
What I was trying to say was,

124
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:17,110
在现代社会的新闻里还能出现艺术的闪光 真是难得啊
I can't believe that in our modern society they let like actual art get onto the news.

125
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:20,380
- 补得漂亮 Hal - 我们去喝杯咖啡什么的吧
-Nice save,Hal. - What are we,like lets just get a coffee or something.

126
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,470
今天可是都市侠的大日子
Come on,it's time to get in the Metro Man day spirit.

127
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:27,100
如果我是都市侠 决不会让大坏蛋绑架你那么多次
Well,if I were Metro Man Megamind wouldn't be kidnapping you all the time.

128
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,470
这是最重要的事
That's the first thing.

129
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,930
你真贴心
That's sweet of you.

130
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,100
我会像澳洲野狗看孩子一样看着你
And I'd be watching you,like a dingo watches a human baby.

131
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,680
- 呃 - 听起来有点怪
-Mmm. - Okay,that sounded,Okay that sounded a little weird.

132
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,880
确实有一点
A little bit,yeah.

133
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,360
你脸色怪怪的 我说什么好呢
And you're making a weird face,and that's making me feel weird.

134
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,400
不是爱啦 我们又没谈恋爱 我不是说我爱你
Not love,we're not in love.I'm not saying I love you.

135
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,010
好吧 我爱你 哎呀其实我也不是这个意思
Okay,I love you,whatever.I'm not saying like I'm in love with you.

136
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,820
我是说...Roxanne?Roxaroo?
I'm saying...Roxanne?Roxaroo?

137
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,110
好好上班
Get back to work.

138
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,290
政府花钱不是让你游手好闲的
The city doesn't pay you to loaf.

139
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,060
- 不许动! - 你们要干什么 伙计们?
-Freeze! - Whoa,what are you doing,guys?

140
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,160
是我!我是典狱长
It's ME!It's the Warden.

141
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,160
喂 开门
Hey,open up.

142
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,400
你们个蠢蛋 都被他玩了
Oh,you fools.He's tricked us.

143
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,950
你说得没错
You were right.

144
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,160
我一直都会是个大坏蛋
I'll always be a villain.

145

你的手表棒极了 Minion
Thanks for sending me the watch,Minion.

154
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,900
那还用说 老板
You got it,boss.

155
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,650
冲啊
Punch it.

156
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,480
来吧 把双手举高
All right,put your hands in the air.

157

女士们绅士们 欢迎都市侠
Ladies and gentlemen,your Metro Man.

158
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,370
- 你们在等谁? - 都市侠
-Who's your Man? - Metro man.

159
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,560
你好 大都会!
Yeah,Metro City!

160
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,420

Give me some,come on give it now.Give it to me.What?

161
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,320
来击掌吧...非常好!

你 嗨 哈 哈 你
Yo,hey,ha,ha yo.

163
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,420
你好 大都会
Hey,Metro city.

164
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,290
你好
Hello,hey.

165
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,940
好了 大家都冷静一点吧
You know,I just want you to bring it down a bit.

166
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,310
小伙子们 小点声
Boys,a little lower.

167
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,720
谢谢
Thank you fellows.

168
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,150
我们现在说点实际的
Let's get real for a moment.

169
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,240
没错 就是那样
That's right,that's right ha,ha,that's right.

170
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,840
尽管有了自己的博物馆确实很酷
Although getting a whole museum is super cool.

171
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,120
很酷 但想知道我收过的最大荣誉吗?
Super cool,you want to know what the greatest honor you've given me is?

172
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,800
真的想知道?
Do you really want to know?

173
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,340
真的?
Really?

174
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,550
我告诉你们
I'll tell you.

175
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,430
你们给我的最大荣誉就是...
The greatest honor you've given me is...

176
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,270
...让我为你们服务
...letting me serve you.

177
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,080
帮助大都会里的市民
To help these people in Metro city.

178
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,740
每天临睡前
And at the end of every day.

179
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,230
嗯
Well.

180
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,080
我常常问自己
I often ask myself.

181
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,270
如果没有你们 我会是谁?
Who would I be,without you?

182
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,280
都市侠 我爱死你了!
I love you Metro Man!

183
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,110
我也爱你 市民朋友
And I love you,random citizen.

184
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:47,210
我跟你说 Minion 没什么能比得上自己的邪恶巢穴了
I tell you Minion,there's no place like evil lair.

185
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:50,760
我特意为您 让它保持潮湿阴冷
I kept it cold and damp,just for you,sir.

186
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,140
我看来怎么样 Minion?
How do I look,Minion?

187
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,270
- 看起来是个坏蛋吗? - 令人恐惧至极 先生
-Do I look bad? - Disgustingly horrifying,sir.

188
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,950
你拍马屁总能拍对地方
You always know what to say.

189
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,220
螺钉头们都想死你了 先生
All the brain-bots certainly missed you,sir.

190
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,850
想爸爸不?最能逞能的是那个小不点?
Did you miss your daddy?Whose the menacing little brains?

191
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,840
是你啊 啊!不许咬 不许咬哦
You are,yes you are.Uh,uh!No biting,no,no,no.

192
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:10,980
- 想要扳手吗?快去抢咯 - 看它们高兴的
-No,no,no.You want the wrench?Go get the wrench. - Oh,look at that.

193
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,520
现在 开始工作
Now,back to work.

194
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,840
她快醒了 快 准备好
She's awake,Quick,to work.

195
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:39,420
- Ritchi小姐 我们又见面了 - 把袋子洗干净会死吗?
-Miss Ritchi,we meet again. - Would it kill you to wash the bag?

196
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,550
随心所欲地叫吧 Ritchi小姐 天皇老子也听不见哦
You can scream all you wish,Miss Ritchi.I'm afraid no one can hear you.

197
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,000
她...她为什么不叫?
Wha..why isn't she screaming?

198
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,360
Ritchi小姐 如果你不介意的话
Miss Ritchi,if you don't mind.

199
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,120
就像这样...啊啊啊!
Like this...AHHHHH!

200
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,820
就是那样 可怜女士的叫法
That's,that's a poor ladies scream.

201
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,480
- 啊啊啊!!! - 你比我擅长多了
-AHHHHH!!! - It's a little better.

202
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,060
你们是在那个特傻的坏蛋网站上
Is there some kind of nerdy super villain website,

203
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,350
买的这堆磁暴线圈和发光转盘吗?
where you get Tesla coils,and blinky dials?

204
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,980
其实主要是在一家直销店...
Actually most of it comes from an outlet store in...

205
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,160
闭嘴
Don't answer that.

206
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,560
罗马尼亚那家
...Romania.

207
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,660
住口!闭嘴!别忘了她是个记者
Don't!Stop!She's using her nosey reporter skills,

208
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,510
她会利用你薄弱的毅力 获得我们全部机密
on your weak willed mind to find out all our secrets.

209
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:23,710
这点小把戏...哼 对我没用
Such tricks...won't work...on me.

210
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,340
- 能再说慢点吗 - 妖精
-Please talk slower -Temptress.

211
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,570
你有什么秘密?一眼就看到底了
What secrets?You're so predictable.

212
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,770
一眼就 看到底了?
Predictable,predictable?

213
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:34,530
哈 那你来试试这个?
Oh,you call THIS predictable?

214
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,670
鳄鱼而已嘛 没错吧
Your Alligators,yes.

215
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,320
来的路上我就想到了
I was thinking about it on the way over.

216
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,830
那这个呢?哇呜!
What's this?BOOM!

217
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,420
- 小心你的脸 - 陈词滥调
-In your face. - Clich?

218
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,450
不 等着看这个
No,look,watch.

219
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,310
幼稚
Juvenile.

220
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,400
- 启动! - 俗不俗啊你
-Shuck it all! - Tacky

221
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,460
- 哎呀这个太可怕了 - 早看见了
-Oh,so sorry. - Seen it.

222
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,310
- 这个呢? - 真俗
-What's this one do? - Garish.

223
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,380
好吧 蜘蛛是个新点子
Okay,the spiders new.

224
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:57,840
蜘蛛?
Spider?

225
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,630
啊 是的!
Ee,Uh,yes!

226
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:08,580
它叫 "织毒...蛛" 只要它轻轻咬你一口
The "spee..ider".Even the smallest bite from arachnis deathicus

227
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,980
你这辈子就瘫了...嗷!
Will instantly paralyze...OW!

228
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,290
把它扯掉!
Get it off!

229
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,940
放弃吧 大坏蛋 你的计划就没得逞过
Ow! - Give it up,Megamind.Your plans never work.

230
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,880
别浪费时间了 赶紧给你男朋友打电话吧?
Let's stop wasting time and call your boyfriend in tights,shall we?

231
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:28,210
很荣幸由我把博物馆授予 都市侠
It is with great pleasure that I present to Metro Man,this new museum.

232
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,490
请
If you please.

233
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,610
喂 我孩子看不见了
Uh,hey,my kid can't see.

234
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:06,590
- 超级大坏蛋 - 好极了 都市侠
-Megamind. - Oh,bravo Metro Man.

235
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,040
没错 我能和你们一起嘘哦
Yes,I can play along too.

236
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,540
早知道你会来砸场子的
Should have known you'd try to crash the party.

237
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,690
恐怕没砸场子这么简单
Oh,I intend to do more than crash it.

238
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:23,500
今天会让你和大都 "费" 永生难忘
This is the day you and Montrosity,shall not soon forget.

239
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,020
是大都会!
It's pronounced Metro City!

240
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,770
土了个豆 番了个茄 土豆 番茄
Oh,potato,tomato,potato,tomato.

241
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,120
我们都知道结局
We all know how this ends.

242
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,000
就是你再入监狱
With you behind bars.

243
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,110
哎呀 我穿着豹皮靴正发抖呢
Oh,I'm shaking in my custom baby seal-leather boots.

244
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,230
准备永别大都 "费" 吧
You will leave,Montrosity.

245
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,020
否则这就是你最后一次听见她了
Or this will be the last you ever hear of,

246
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,990
Roxanne Ritchi!
Roxanne Ritchi!

247
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,990
- 嗯? - Roxanne!
-Huh? - Roxanne!

248
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:48,300
- 别慌 Roxie 我马上就到 - 一点都不慌
-Don't panic Roxie,I'm on my way. - I'm not panicking.

249
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,320
想打败我 连我在哪都不知道 都市侠
In order to stop me,You need to find me first,Metro Man.

250
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,900
我们在废弃的天文台
We're at the abandoned observatory.

251
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,140
- 啊哈 - 不!不是!
-Ah ha. - NO!No we're not!

252
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,260
别听她瞎说 她疯了
Don't listen to her,she's crazy.

253
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,810
都市侠快到了 先生
Metro Man approaching,sir.

254
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,590
等一下
Hold on a second.

255
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,670
噢 天哪
Oh,good heavens.

256
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:56,150
没想到我们是在真的天文台吧 嗯?
You didn't think you were in the real observatory,did you?

257
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,600
准备启动死亡射线 Minion
Ready the death ray,Minion.

258
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,250
死亡射线 准备待发
Death ray,readying.

259
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,660
看这边 我的老朋友
Over here,old friend.

260
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,930
友情提醒下
In case you haven't noticed,

261
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,280
你中了我的计了
You've fallen right into my trap.

262
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,190
正义永远不会被打败 这是理想 是信仰
You can't trap justice.It's an idea,a belief.

263
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:20,780
就算最虔诚的信仰 也被时间侵蚀
Even the most heartfelt belief,can be corroded over time.

264
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,570
正义是不锈钢
Justice is a noncorrosive metal.

265
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,180
是金属就会被 "球" 恨这热融化的
But metals can be melted by the heat of 're-vange'.

266
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,310
是仇恨 而且最好冷藏保存
It's 'revenge' and it's best served cold.

267

You of all people,know we discontinued that promotion.

-Chow,chow all. - Same time next week?

293
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,650

Copper drains my powers.

00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:59,000
好主意 Minion 但没有他 有啥意义呢?
Good idea,Minion.But without him,what's the point?

401
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,130
- 什么他 主人? - 没什么
-Him,sir? - Nothing.

402
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,170
好吧 那么 那就...
Okay,um,all right well just uh,that's uh,

403
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,940
当是备用选项吧
something to consider and um,

404
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:11,100
我想我还是休息一下吧
well,I think I'll just power down for a while then.

405
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,030
我们一直被他守护着
He was always there for us.

406
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,190
依靠他
Dependable.

407
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,510
也许我们太习以为常了
Perhaps we took him for granted.

408
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:29,960
直到失去时才懂得去珍惜
Maybe we never really know how good we have it,until it's gone.

409
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,200
我们想念你 都市侠
We miss you,Metro Man.

410
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,370
我也想你了
I,miss you.

411
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:38,840
我对超级大坏蛋只有一个问题
And I have just one question for,Megamind.

412
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:40,790
现在你高兴了?
Are you happy now?

413
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:47,080
这是Roxanne Ritchi 在这座无超人的城市为您报道
This is Roxanne Ritchi reporting from a city without a hero.

414
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,810
接下来 你想当奴隶大军吗?你们该知道的
Coming up next.Are you ready to be a slave army?What you need to know.

415
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:03,270
完美收尾 当是孩子的圣诞礼物
Aaannd wrap that up and give it to a child on Christmas.

416
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,380
- 因为我们完工了 - 好了 明天见 Hal
-'Cause we're done. - Okay,see you tomorrow,Hal.

417
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,750
等等 Roxie 我家正要办个派对
Wait,Roxie.I'm having a party at my house.

418
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,920
就算是放松一下什么的 你应该来玩
Coming off the hook,or whatever.You should come over.

419
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,950
我找了个DJ 租了个气垫屋 还有一堆酒 会很狂欢的
I got a DJ rented a bouncy house.Made a gallon of dip.It's gonna be sick.

420
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,300
我不知道 Hal 我不太想去人多的地方
Oh,I don't know,Hal.I don't really fell like being around a bunch of people.

421
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,450
不 不 不 那更好 因为只有你和我
No,no,no.That's the best part,it'll be like just you and me.

422
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:28,120
哇哦 那很吸引人啊
Wow,that uh,that's certainly very tempting.

423
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,040
- 但是... - 我还请了个婚礼摄影师
-But, - I did hire a wedding photographer.

424
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,960
只是以防我们会做什么疯事
That's just in case,we were like something crazy happened.

425
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,810
像是你想拍张照片 也许我们应该拍一张当是
And you'd want a picture of it.Like maybe we should have this for like ever,

426
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,260
永久的纪念
like a memory,you know.

427
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,230
嗯 我还是不去了
Um,I'm gonna pass.

428
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:42,360
还有事要做呢 好了 再见
I have some work here I need to do.Okay,bye.

429
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,630
周四如何?周四可以考虑?
So Thursday?Soft,Thursday?

430
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,800
- 晚安 Hal - 那就是有机会了 周四哦
-Goodnight,Hal. - It's a soft yes,on Thursday.

431
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:50,170
我是怎么搞的?
What's,wrong with me?

432
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:54,640
租了间气垫屋?女孩又不喜欢那个 她们喜欢小丑嘛
Rented a bouncy house?Chick's don't like bouncy houses,they like clown's.

433
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,600
噢!哦~
OW!Ohhh!

434
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,780
该死的笨车!弄断我的手指!
Stupid van!Broke my finger!

435
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,820
我犯了个大错误
I've made a horrible mistake.

436
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,580
我不是有意要灭你的
I didn't mean to destroy you.

437
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,270
我是说我有意要灭你
I mean,I meant to destroy you.

438
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,640
但没想过会成功
I didn't think it would really work.

439
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:53,570
我们接下来要怎么做?没有你 恶人横行街头
What are we suppose to do?Without you,evil is running rampant through the streets.

440
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:57,170
我厌倦了横行街头
I am so tired of running rampant through the streets.

441
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,660
没有英雄阻止 作恶又有何意思?
What's the point of being bad when there's no good to try and stop you?

442
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,210
得有人来阻止超级大坏蛋
Someone has to stop,Megamind.

443
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,490
嘿 我们要关门了
Hey,we're closing soon.

444
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,700
哦 你吓死我了
Oh,you scared me.

445
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,500
- Barry吧? - Bernard
-Barry,right? - Bernard.

446
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:12,910
Bernard 我只是...在自言自语
Bernard,I was just well I was talking to myself.

447
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,660
你可能觉得我有点犯傻了
You may think I'm a little bit nuts.

448
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,900
我可没被允许乱猜测
I'm not allowed to self guess directly.

449
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,740
谢谢 我只是...
Thank you,I just...

450
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,490
Bernard 我过会就走
Bernard,I'll just be another minute.

451
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,080
- 好的 - 谢谢
-Okay. - Thanks.

452
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,790
我还是很多邪恶的计划没启用呢
I had so many evil plans in the works.

453
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,780
文盲射线
The illiteracy beam.

454
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,960
台风奶酪
Typhoon cheese.

455
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,610
机器山羊
Robo sheep.

456
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:35,650
那要是打起来一定空前绝后
Battles we will now,never have.

457
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:41,170
我们都没机会好好道个别
You know we never had the chance to say goodbye.

458
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:44,540
所以现在我们要好好叙叙
So,it's good that we have this time now.

459
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,190
趁着我还没炸飞这里之前
You know,before I destroy the place.

460
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,610
不是针对你的 只是这里给了我很多悲惨的回忆
Nothing personal,it just brings back to many painful memories.

461
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,660
有人吗?
Hello,hello?

462
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,700
Roxanne!
Roxanne!

463
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,460
这装扮真没品
That's a pretty tasteless costume.

464
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:14,180
- 装扮? - 超级大坏蛋的头没大得这么恶心
-Costume? - Megamind's head is not that grossly exaggerated.

465
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:18,970
哦 你还做了把劣质的仿冒脱水枪 真是...
Oh you even made a cheap replica of his dehydration gun.How...

466
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,910
你好 有人在那吗?
Hello,is someone there?

467
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,960
你好 谁在那?
Hello,who's there?

468
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:30,040
哇哦!嘿嘿
Whoa!Hey,hey.Whew.

469
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,160
是你啊 Bernard
It's just you,Bernard.

470
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,910
是的 就是我 Bernard
Oh,yes it's just me.Bernard.

471
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,560
谢谢你能让我多呆会
Well thank you for letting me stay.

472
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,510
要换是我 就不会多呆个2分30秒
Look I wouldn't stay for more than two minutes and thirty seven seconds if I were you.

473
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:42,260
这里的墙和天花板都要换掉
We're having the walls and ceiling removed.

474
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,560
哇哦 听起来要大改造啊
Wow,that sounds like.Quite the renovation.

475
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,550
我跟你一起下去吧
I guess I'll.Guess I'll ride down with you then.

476
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:57,470
我一直以为他能在最后一秒逃出生天
I kept thinking he was going to do one of his last minute escapes.

477
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,320
是啊 他很在行的说
Yeah,he was really good at those.

478
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:04,080
哦 要是世界有重启按钮该有多好啊
Oh,if only the world had a reset button.

479
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,940
我也想要重启按钮啊
I've looked into the reset button.

480
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,860
但做不到那尺寸啊
The size is impossible.

481
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,610
哦 Bernard 你也会...感慨啊 你还好吗?
Oh,Bernard,I didn't know you had...feelings.Are you okay?

482
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:21,520
都市侠已经去世了 现在没人能对抗超级大坏蛋了
Metro Man is gone.And now there's no one left to challenge Megamind.

483
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,230
拜托 Bernard
Oh,come on,Bernard.

484
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,960
有邪恶的地方 就会诞生正义
As long as there's evil good will rise up against it.

485
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,880
哦 我希望啊
Ohhh,I wish.

486
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,950
我坚信一定有人会觉醒来对抗超级大坏蛋
I believe someone is going to stand up to Megamind.

487
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:31,990
- 你真这么想? - 是的
-You really think so? - Yeah.

488
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:35,860
就像老话说的 英雄不是天生的 而是被塑造的
I mean,it's like they say.Heroes aren't born,they're made.

489
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,730
英雄是被塑造的 对了!
Heroes can be made.That's it!

490
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,920
- 我们要做的就是找到对的成分 - 是啊
-All you need are the right ingredients. - Yeah.

491
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:46,560
- 勇敢 - 是的
-Bravery. - Yes.

492
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:47,860
- 力量 - 当然
-Strength. - Of course.

493
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,670
- 决心 - 必要
-Determination. - Imperative.

494
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,630
还有一点DNA
And a smidgen of DNA.

495
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,050
- 有了这些 任何人都能成英雄 - 对头
-With that,anyone can be a hero. - Yeah!

496
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,710
哦 哦 哦 哦!
Oh,ho,ho,ho!

497
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,260
我想我们该跑了
I think we should run.

498
00:31:58,990 --> 00:31:59,990
再见
Bye.

499
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,340
现在该忘记过去
Time to put the past behind us.

500
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,720
展望未来了...哈!
Only the future...AHH!

501
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,040
哦 我离得太近 真是吓到我了
Oh,I'm to close.I'm genuinely scared right now.

502
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,470
哦 我可不希望有人看到
Oh,I hope no ones seeing this.

503
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:16,330
造英雄?等等 您为什么要这么做?
Create a hero?Wait,wait,what?Why would you do that?

504
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:18,040
这样我才有对手啊
So I have someone to fight.

505
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,780
Minion 我是个没有对手的恶棍
Minion,I'm a villain without a hero.

506
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,810
缺少阳的阴
A ying,with no yang.

507
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:25,230
没有牛斗的斗牛士
A bull fighter with no bull to fight.

508
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,880
换句话说 我没了目标
In other words,I have no purpose.

509
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,580
现在问我如何造英雄
Now,ask me how I'm going to do it.

510
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,730
快问吧
Go on,ask.

511
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,230
您要如何造英雄?
How are you doing to do it?

512
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,720
我要找个人 现在还不知道是谁
I'm going to give someone,I don't know who yet.

513
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:43,350
给他都市侠的超能力 还要把那人训练成大都市的新英雄
Metro Man's powers.I'm going to train that someone to become Montrocity's new hero.

514
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:45,080
这里呢 跟着点
Over here,follow.

515
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:50,300
最后我将和他对打 来一场正义与邪恶的大战
And then,finally I'm going to fight that hero.In an epic battle of good and evil.

516
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:53,230
我们要将一切恢复正常
We could put everything back the way it was.

517
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,680
到时世界就变得完美
When the world was perfect.

518
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:58,120
和美好 听好了 Minion
And rosy.Behold,Minion.

519
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,240
都市侠的斗篷
Metro Man's cape.

520
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,250
仔细看清楚
Look closely.

521
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,900
你看到了什么?
Tell me what you see?

522
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,910
头屑?
Dandruff?

523
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:06,650
是的 是他的DNA
Yes,it's his DNA.

524
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:11,600
有了这个 我们能提取都市侠的超能力
From this,we'll extract the source of Metro Man's awesome power.

525
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:16,570
主人 我觉得这是坏主意
Sir,I think this is a bad idea.

526
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:21,740
是的 对一个好人来说 这是个非常坏的点子
Yes,It's a very wickedly bad idea.For the greater good of man.

527
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,410
但我的意思那是个很糟糕的主意
But I'm saying this is a kind of bad,bad.

528
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:27,350
好吧 因为您出发点是坏的 所以觉得是个好主意
Okay,you might think it's good in your bad perception.

529
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:30,790
但往好的方向想 这真的是个坏主意
But from a good perception,it is just plain bad.

530
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,140
哦 你又不知道 对坏蛋来说什么是好主意
Oh,you don't know what's good for bad.

531
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,600
现在我们只有一次机会
Now we have just one shot at this.

532
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,840
得找到一个合适的人选
We must find a suitable subject.

533
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:45,770
那人会来对抗我 会舍己为人
Someone who will do harm to mine.Who puts the welfare of others above their own.

534
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,870
这是啥声音?
What on earth is that?

535
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:53,030
好像是从那里传出来的 主人
Seems to be emanating from there,sir.

536
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:58,430
- 哦好 - 呃 是你好
-O-llo, - Uh,it's hello.

537
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,120

Hello,like that?

538
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:02,430
- Bernard 是我Roxanne - 是Roxanne
-Bernard,it's Roxanne. - It's Roxanne.

539
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,850
我想谢谢你那天激发了我
I just want to thank you for inspiring me the other day.

540
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:07,180
- 哦 你也激发了我 - 很好!
-Oh,You've inspired me too. - Great!

541
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:11,000
是时候翻身去对抗超级大坏蛋了 让他们见识下我们的厉害
It's time we stood up to Megamind and show him he can't push us around.

542
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:13,630
哦 哦 真的吗?她真可爱
Oh,oh really.She's so cute.

543
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,600
- 我已经掌握他的行踪了 - 呃
-I'm already hot on his trail. - Uh,huh.

544
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,780
你是怎么知道的?
And what gives you that idea?

545
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,200
- 呃 主人 - 我刚找到了他的秘密基地
-Uh,sir. - I just found his secret hideout.

546
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,720
她是怎么找到的?
How did she find my hideout?

547
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,950
呃 你是怎么找到的?
Uh,how did you find his hideout?

548
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:29,610
因为只有这座建筑有t望台
This is the only building in Metro City with a big observatory on the roof.

549
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:35,250
好吧 那她也找不到秘密入口
Okay,there's no way she'll find the secret entrance.

550
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,890
哦!这里有个门垫 写着"秘密入口"
Oh!There's a doormat here that say's 'Secret Entrance'.

551
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,960
- Minion! - 人家老是忘记嘛
-Minion! - I kept forgetting where it was.

552
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,560
她会发现我们所有的秘密的
She'll discover all our secrets.

553
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:46,760
- 哦 不好! - 你真是科学造出的白痴
-Ohh,oh no! - You dim-witted creation of science.

554
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,750
- 什么? - 哦 不是说你Roxanne
-What? - Oh,not you Roxanne.

555
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,080
不是 我是在对我的妈妈们喊
No,I was just yelling at my mothers,urn.

556
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,860
不要乱动 我这就来
Don't do anything,I'll be right there.

557
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,860
Roxanne?

558
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:57,030

00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,620
Roxanne．

560
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:07,000
哦 我真高兴你来了
-Whoa! - Oh,I'm glad you're here.

561
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,710
等等 你怎么来得这么快?
Wait,how did you get here so fast?

562
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,760
那个 我 呃 你打给我时 我正在竞走
Well,I uh.I happened to be speed walking nearby when you called.

563
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,010
- 穿着西装? - 呃
-In a suit? - Uh huh.

564
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:16,340
这是"竞走正式装"
It's called,'Formal Speed walking'.

565
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,840
但这不重要啦
But that's not important.

566
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,960
我还是来带路吧
I better take the lead.

567
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,100
这里写着是出口
This way looks exciting.

568
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:20,880
不 那是出口
No,it says,exit.

569
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,150
呃 是"输出入口"的简称 对吧?
Uh,which is the abbreviation for 'Exciting',right?

570
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,650
这里是主控室
It's the mother load.

571
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,980
- 啊 - 哇哦
-Ahh. - Wow.

572
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,650
- 哇哦 - 看看这东西
-Wow. - Just look at this thing.

573
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:32,320
我真的需要你来帮我解读一下
You know,I really could use your help in deciphering all this.

574
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:35,450
- 真的吗? - 你对超级大坏蛋很有研究 对吧?
-Really? - You're an expert in all things Megamind,right?

575
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:39,940
- 是的 - 团结就能找到并阻止他的邪恶计划
-Yes,right. - Together we could figure out his plan for the city and stop it.

576
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,990
你同意吗?
Are you in?

577
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,320
- 哦 乐意之至! - 这才对嘛
-Oh,what fun! - That's what I want to hear.

578
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,430
Minion 接暗号 去把脑虫放出来
Minion,Code-Send in the brain bots.

579
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,870
所谓的暗号是指...
You know the whole point of a code is...

580
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,890
哦 接暗号去做 Minion
Oh code-just do it,Minion.

581

超级大坏蛋!
Megamind!

585
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,790
你把Bernard怎么了?
What have you done with,Bernard?

586
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:10,050
哦 Bernard?哦 是的 我要对那人施以酷刑
Oh Bernard?Oh yes,I'm doing horrible things to that man.

587
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:12,320
我不想细说 但有激光 长钉
I don't want to get into it but,Lasers,spikes.

588
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,340
哦 不要 不要用激光和长钉!
Oh,please no,not the lasers and the spikes!

589
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,870
你还不清楚吗
You know the drill.

590
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,690
哦 不 不要用钻子
Oh no,not the drill.

591
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:21,550
- 放他走 - 不然如何?
-Let him go. - Or what?

592
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:24,240
不然我就用你来试这怪枪
Or I'm going to find out what this weird looking gun does.

593
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,830
不要!别开枪
No don't!Don't shoot that gun.

594
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,450
我去带他出来
I'll just go get him.

595
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,400
放开我 恶魔!
Unhand me you fiend!

596
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:33,220
太强大了
It,its strength's to much.

597
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,420
哥可是练过的
Oh,I work out.

598
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:40,510
那你就要惨了 你这么苗条 而我是天生神力
Argh,it's really paying off.You're so fit,and strangely charismatic.

599
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:45,120
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

600
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,960
我尽力了 但他太厉害了
I've did my best.But he's to fantastic.

601
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,400
来 让我扛这大枪吧
Here,let me carry that heavy gun for you.

602
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,470
我能行
I got this covered.

603
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,140
放手 那是我的!
Let go,it's mine!

604
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,220
Bernard 快跑!
Bernard,run!

605
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,940
还给我
Give it to me.

606
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:02,270
哦 不!
Oh no!

607
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,970
Roxanne．
Roxanne.

608
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:11,710
哦!
Ow!

609
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,530
那是啥东东啊?
Who on earth is that?

610
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,720
Roxanne!
Roxanne!

611
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,950
Bernard 你猜对了 那门就是出口
Bernard,you were right about that door being exciting.

612
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:33,490
这边走
This way.

613
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,350
你干嘛?
-Aha! - What are you doing?

614
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,190
这能阻止它们 给!
This will stop them,here!

615
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:44,180
好像有点过火了吧
Seems a bit extreme,doesn't it.

616
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,090
快扔啊
Just throw it.

617
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,880
爹地很抱歉
Daddy's,sorry.

618
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,580
- 哇哦 真是太刺激了 - 是啊
-Wow,that was real exciting. - Yeah.

619
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,290
- 你表现得很勇敢 - 我知道
-You were very strong in there. - I know.

620
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:07,220
除了都市侠 我还没见谁能这样对抗他
I've never seen anyone but Metro Man stand up to him like that.

621
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,380
出什么事了?
What's going on?

622
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,650
Hal 怎么了?
Hal,what happened?

623
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,060
好像一只蜜蜂钻进我鼻子了
I think a bee flew up my nose.

624
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,260
我正想正面突击去救你
I was just about to make my frontal assault to rescue you,

625
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,250
但好像有5个忍者挡住了我
but like fifty ninjas started to attack me.

626
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:19,210
所以我得先制服他们 也成功了
So I had to beat them all up,and I did...

627
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,520
- 他们被打得抱头痛哭 - 哇哦
-and they were all like crying,and stuff. - Wow.

628
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,210
他很英勇 对吧
Brave one,isn't he.

629
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,360
你是哪位?
Who are you?

630
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,060
这是Bernard
Oh thi...,this is Bernard.

631
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,670
- 他是我的搭档 - 搭档?
-He's my partner. - Partner?

632
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:28,540
是...是的 搭档
Yes,yes partner.

633
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,000
去你的搭档 我才是她的搭档
Well look partner,I'm her partner.

634
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,310
她惊魂未定 胡说八道呢
She doesn't know what she's saying.She's been through a traumatic experience.

635
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:36,440
我还是送他回家吧 谢谢了 Bernard
I'd better take him home.Thanks again,Bernard.

636
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:45,900
明天打给你 搭档
I'll call you tomorrow,partner.

637
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,880
好的
Yeah,okay.

638
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,900
很荣幸
I'd like that.

639
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,190
所有人都不正常 连你都抱他不抱我
That was weird for everybody.'Cause you accidentally,hugged him instead of me.

640
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,490
长官!
Sir!

641
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:54,830
长官!
SIR!

642
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,330
你找出它的身份了吗?
Code-Did you find out who it was?

643
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,580
什么?噢
Huh?Oh,oh.

644
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,110
车子呢
Code-get the car.

645
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,600
马上到 长官
Code-right away,sir.

646
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,800
- 再见 - 明天见 Hal
-Bye. - See you tomorrow,Hal.

647
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,200
我门不锁了 随时等你来检查
I'll leave the door unlocked in case you want to check on me later.

648
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:22,530
这人是谁?他被灌入超人的力量
Who is this man,we've infused with godlike power?

649
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,970
噢 哇
Ow,ow,whoa ho.

650
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:28,890
报告长官 他叫Hal Stewart 28岁
Well sir,his name's Hal Stewart.He's twenty eight years old.

651
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:30,560
无犯罪记录
No criminal record.

652
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,900
根本没任何记录
Actually,no records at all.

653
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,250
看来这人一事无成
Apparently,this man hasn't accomplished anything.

654
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,800
别妄下定论 Minion
Not yet,Minion.Not...

655
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:38,670
别
...Yet.

656
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,440
还有更好的事发生吗?
Could this day get anymore,funtastic?

657
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:43,570
我马上消除他的力量
So I will just go ahead and defuse him,

658
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:46,990
显然这是个错误
since this is clearly a mistake.

659
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:49,710
不 Minion 更强大的力量就要出现了
No,Minion.Something much more powerful at work.

660
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,760
这不是错误
This is no mistake.

661
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,480
这是命运
It's destiny.

662
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:58,920
Hal Stewart 迎接你的命运吧
Hal Stewart,prepare for your destiny.

663
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,610
Hal?Hal Stewart?
Hal?Hal Stewart?

664
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,630
我说得对吗?
Am I saying it right?

665
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,940
- Stewart - 啊

Is this a robbery?'Cause the lady across the hall has way better stuff than me.

667
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,650

他看上去不像个英雄
Well,he doesn't look quite the hero type to me.

673
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:28,150
你个讨厌鬼 Minion

梦已经实现了
This is a dream come true.

I have to,run a quick errand.

803
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:12,210
你没什么好忙的
You don't run errands.

804
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,670
发生什么了?
What's going on here?

805
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:15,860
- 什么? - 慢着
-What? - Oh,wait a minute.

806
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:20,720
你是不是为了他喷了 Jean-Paul Gaultier香水 ?
Are you wearing Jean-Paul Gaultier's,For Him?

807
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,970
这只是平时的装扮
It's just my natural musk.

808
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:23,920
车钥匙在哪儿?
Now,where are the car keys?

809
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:25,020
啊
Ahhh.

810
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:28,510
啊 啊 是Ritchi小姐 不是吗?
Uh,uh,uh,uh.This is about Ms.Ritchi,isn't it.

811
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:30,270
你和她在约会
Your going on a date with her.

812
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:34,980
少来了 我的朋友
No my main man,get out of town.

813
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:38,470
你爱上她就糟糕了
Oh this is bad,this is bad.You've fallen in love with her.

814
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:40,880
别忘了你的身份 Minion
You are forgetting your place,Minion.

815
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,510
给我钥匙
Now give me the keys.

816
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:47,320
万一Roxanne发现你的真面目呢?
What happens when Roxanne finds out who you really are?

817
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:49,100
她不会知道的
She will never find out.

818
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:51,160
这就是该撒谎的时候
That's the point of lying.

819
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,090
啊!
Ahhh!

820
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:57,050
老实说 如果我没猜错 今天是你变坏的第一天
Honestly,If I didn't know any better I'd think this was your first day of being evil.

821
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:58,310
不!
NO!

822
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,400
太过分了
This has gone far enough.

823
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,930
还真成熟啊
Oh,that was really grown up.

824
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:09,270
长官 听我说 这是为你好
Sir please,it's for your own good.

825
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:10,800
你知道什么
Well what do you know.

826
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:12,990
虽然我知道的不多 但我知道
I may not know much,but I do know this.

827
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,150
坏人得不到女孩的心
The bad guy doesn't get the girl.

828
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,920
也许我不想再做坏人了
Maybe I don't want to be the bad guy anymore.

829
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:23,990
听见了没
You heard me.

830
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:25,820
你是谁?
Who are you?

831
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:29,400
- 给我钥匙 - 不!
-Now give me the keys. - NO!

832
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,690
我的使命是照顾你
My soul purpose in life is to look after you.

833
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,710
我不需要你来照顾
Well I don't need you to look after me.

834
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,950
你...你说什么?
What are you...what are you saying?

835
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:39,770
- 你不需要我? - 跟你说白了
-You don't need me? - Let me make it clear.

836
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:42,100
我不需要你
Code-I don't need you.

837
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:43,910
你知道吗 你知道吗
You know what,you know what.

838
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,460
我打包走人了
Code-I'll just pack my thing and go.

839
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,630
好的!
Code-Fine!

840
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:52,250
好就好
Code-Fine back.

841
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:57,450
祝你约会成功
Well good luck on your date.

842
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:00,300
- 一定会的 - 这毫无意义
-I will. - That doesn't even make any sense.

843
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:01,250
我懂
I know.

844
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:35,760
已经很接近了 我能感觉到
I know I am so close,I can feel it.

845
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:42,030
好吧 我该退一步想想
Okay,okay I just have to take a step back.

846
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:49,280
等等
Wait a minute.

847
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:03,500
Titan．
Titan.

848
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:05,410
Titan是什么?
What's a Titan?

849
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:08,620
我的顺风耳在燃烧
My super ears are burning.

850
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:13,150
我只听得见罪犯的声音 你不会这么调皮吧?
I usually just hear criminals.You haven't been naughty,have you?

851
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,370
开玩笑 开玩笑
I'm totally messing with you.I'm totally messing with you.

852
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:17,490
我叫Titan
The names Titan.

853
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:21,900
- Titan? - 你的专用英雄守护神
-Titan? - Your very own heroic guardian of pure awesome.

854
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,000
你叫什么?开玩笑的 我知道你的一切
What's your name?Just kidding,I know everything about you.

855
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,160
噢!我带来了一些花
Oh,oh!And I brought some flowers,

856
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,630
不知道你喜欢哪一种 所以我全摘来了
Didn't know what you liked,so I just grabbed you know,all of them.

857
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:35,400
好吧 你不喜欢花 那就忘了吧
Okay,you don't like flowers.Okay,uh,uh,forget the flowers.

858
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,690
- 你想干吗? - 也许我们能去兜兜风
-What do you want? - Thought maybe we could go for a little flight around town.

859
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:40,420
- 先了解对方 - 哇!
-Get to know each other first. - WHOA!

860
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:43,310
这对你来说有点刺激
It's suppose to be very thrilling for you.

861
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:44,510
你知道自己在干吗吗?
Just what do you think you're doing?

862
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:45,680
我飞得太快了?
Oh are I moving to fast?

863
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,860
你说得对 在我们相爱之前 应该先救你几次
You're probably right.I should just rescue you a few times before we get all romantic.

864
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:51,170
啊呀!
Whoops!

865
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:55,230
接住你 有大英雄守护你真幸运
Saved you.You are lucky to have such a great hero here.

866
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:57,770
不 谁来帮帮忙?
Oh no.Somebody do something?

867
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:00,250
对 对 我来救你了
Oh,right,right.Duh!I gotcha.

868
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:09,670
真好玩 你差点死了 但我救了你
That was fun,you almost died.But I saved you.

869
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:11,230
- 啊 大楼! - 啊!
-Aaaah,building! - AH!

870
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:16,710
接住了!
Gotcha!

871
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:19,330
不好意思 你刚说什么?
Whoo,I'm sorry.What were you saying?

872
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:21,690
我听不见 被我救你的声音覆盖了
I couldn't hear you over the sound of me saving your life.

873
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:23,310
放下我 马上!
Put me down,right now!

874
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:25,850
好吧 好吧 抓紧了
Okay,all right,all right,hold on.

875
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,810
你疯了吗?
Are you crazy?

876
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:33,490
我想我是有点疯狂...为了你
I suppose I'm,a little crazy...about you.

877
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,160
你是谁?说真的
Who are you?Really.

878
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:40,170
好吧 准备大吃一惊吧 小姐
Oooh,oooh,right.Well prepare to have your mind blown,little lady.

879
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,530
- 看! - Hal?
-Tada! - Hal?

880
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:45,900
是啊 这不是很好吗?
Yeah,isn't this great?

881
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,070
没有什么能把我们分开了
Now there's nothing keeping us apart.

882
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:49,990
不 一点也不好
No,it's not great.

883
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:54,360
我们的第一次飞行 太浪漫了 就像一对老夫老妻
Wow,our first fight.This is so us,we're like an old married couple.

884
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:57,510
没有我们 我们永远不可能
There is no us,okay.There will never be an us.

885
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:59,990
但是我有力量
But,I have powers.

886
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:02,780
我有斗篷 我是好人
I have a cape,I'm the good guy.

887
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:03,550
你是好人 Hal
You are a good guy,Hal.

888
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:06,840
但你不明白为什么...
But you don't understand we need to find out why...

889
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,830
- 现在 - 这样不对
-Right now, - This isn't right.

890
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:11,110
- 听着 Hal - 你应该和我在一起
-Listen to me,Hal. - You're suppose to be with me.

891
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:13,250
我在警告你 Hal
I'm trying to warn you,Hal.

892
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:17,090
是Titan 不是Hal
It's Tighten.It's TIGHTEN,not Hal.

893
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:42,070
- Bernard． - Roxanne．
-Bernard. - Roxanne.

894
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:45,750
- 对不起我迟到了 - 你的头发很刺激
-Sorry I'm late. - Wow,your hair looks exciting.

895
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:48,900
今晚不止是头发很刺激
Hmm,not the only exciting development of the night.

896
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,360
超级大坏蛋创造了一个新英雄
Megamind's created a new hero.

897
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,700
我知道原因
And I know why.

898
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:55,290
一切都说得通了
It all makes sense now.

899
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:59,850
他怀念被人踢屁股的感觉 所以创造英雄来对付他
He missed getting his butt kicked,so he created a new hero to kick it for him.

900
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,610
但他为什么会选Hal?
But why did he pick,Hal?

901
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:05,750
Hal是最不可能被选的人
Hal is the worst possible person you could pick.

902
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:08,100
这很难理解
Wow,that's a lot to take in.

903
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:09,940
让我大吃一惊
It,it boggles my mind.

904
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:11,940
我也很惊讶
I am extremely boggled.

905
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:15,300
谁踢谁的屁股一定会见分晓
You know,I'm sure we'll get to the bottom of who's kicking who's butt.

906
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,310
但与此同时
But in the mean time.

907
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,630
让我们先享受在一起的时光吧
Let's enjoy each other's company.

908
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:22,870
抱歉 Bernard 你说得对
I'm sorry,Bernard.Of course,your right,

909
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:25,810
我应该先喘口气
you know,I could use a breather.

910
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:31,610
为了Bernard 为你是我疯狂世界中 唯一正常的人
To,Bernard.For being the only normal thing in my crazy upside down world.

911
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:34,920
为了...正常
To...being normal.

912
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:47,310
- Roxanne - 怎么了?
-Roxanne. - Yes?

913
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:50,510
如果我不是正常人
Say I wasn't so normal.

914
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:57,290
如果我秃了 而且是有色人种
Say I was bald and had the complexion of a popular primary color.

915
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,330
只是打个比方
As a random,non specific example.

916
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,960
你还会对我有兴趣吗?
Would you still enjoy my company?

917
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,790
当然 不能以貌取人
Of course,you don't judge a book by its cover.

918
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,420
或以外表看人
Or a person from the outside.

919
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:09,330
太让人欣慰了
Oh,that's a relief to hear.

920
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:11,110
根据人的行为来评判
You judge them based on their actions.

921
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:14,390
我看起来有点小心眼 不觉得吗?
Well that seems kinda petty,don't you think.

922
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:45,790
- 你 - 怎么了?
-You. - What,what?

923
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:48,680
别看着我!
Oh,don't look at me!

924
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,500
只是个技术错误
Just,just a technical glitch.

925
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:51,870
别看
Don't look yet.

926
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,050
我错了
My bad.

927
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:58,820
刚说到哪了?
Where were we?

928
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,150
别动
Now,now,hold on.

929
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:03,740
你!
YOU!

930
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:26,580
听我解释
I can explain.

931
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,350
你刚才说的那些话呢?
What about everything you just said?

932
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:32,650
关于以貌取人
About judging a book by it's cover.

933
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:36,000
先得看看目录好吗?
Well let's take a look at the contents then,shall we?

934
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,430
你毁了都市侠
You destroyed Metro Man.

935
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:42,790
你占据了城市并让我爱上你
You took over the city and then you actually got me to care about you.

936
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:46,690
你怎么这么坏?
Why are you so evil?

937
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:48,110
耍我?
Tricking me?

938
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:51,180
你想得到什么?
What could you possibly hope to gain?

939
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:57,280
慢着
Wait a minute.

940
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,080
我不相信
Oh,I don't believe this.

941
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:07,010
你难道以为我会跟你在一起吗?
Do you really think that I would ever be with you?

942
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:10,470
没有...
no...

943
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:46,230
好吧 Minion 你是对的
Okay Minion,you were right.

944
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,240
我...我也没错啦
I was....less right.

945
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,830
我们还是重操旧业吧
We should stick to what we're good at.

946
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,720
做坏人
Being bad.

947
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,030
Minion．
Minion...

948
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:16,470
你
You there.

949
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,560
就你
Yeah,you.

950
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,740
把黑蟒战袍拿来!
Bring out,the 'Black Mamba'!

951
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:59,220
好了 Titan 是时候出来耍耍了
Okay,Titan it's time to go down,in style.

952
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:24,060
我听说又冒出来个英雄
I hear there's a new hero.

953
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:26,490
敢跟我过招
who dares to challenge my evil.

954
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:29,740
叫什么来着 Titan?
Where is the one they call,Titan?

955
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,990
有种你就来啊
Challenge me,if you dare.

956
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:00,260
噢 不 我们要掉下去了
Oh no,we're gonna crash.

957
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,330
太丢人了
This is embarrassing.

958
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:15,020
莽夫 幼齿
Ballsy and incipient.

959
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:18,810
愚蠢 没责任心
Boneheaded,irresponsible.

960
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,090
粗鲁!
RUDE!

961
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:22,670
不专业 说的就是你
Unprofessional,that's what this is.

962
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:26,180
都市侠会让我干等吗?
Would Metro Man have kept me waiting?

963
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:28,260
当然不会 人家很专业的
Of course not,he was a pro.

964
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:31,100
嘿 超级大坏蛋 我正想见你呢
Hey,Megamind.You're actually the guy I want to see.

965
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,790
而且 这儿又不是没门
Also,there's a door here.

966
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:37,040
你知道我等了你多久吗?
Do you have any idea how long I waited for you?

967
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,570
不 不 不 我完全能理解你
No,no,no,I totally understand what you're saying.

968
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:41,270
你等会儿行不 我正打算通关呢
Could you just shut up for one second,I'm trying to beat this level.

969
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,490
你有想过要来吗?
Were you even planning on showing up?

970
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:45,130
这是什么?
What's this?

971
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:49,670
这是哪儿来的?
Where did you get all this stuff?

972
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,500
都不是我的
It doesn't belong to me.

973
00:59:51,610 --> 00:59:52,990
你偷的!
You stole it!

974
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:55,470
- 很帅吧 - 不对 不对 你是英雄
-Pretty cool,right. - Oh no,no,no.You're a hero.

975
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:57,070
衰人才当英雄
Being a hero is for losers.

976
00:59:57,070 --> 00:59:59,860
没日没夜地战斗 战斗 图什么呀?
It's work,work,work twenty four seven,and for what?

977
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:05,200
我作秀是为了把妹 结果发现 Roxanne根本不想跟我在一起
I only took the gig to get the girl.And it turns out Roxanne doesn't want anything to do with me.

978
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:06,870
Roxanne Ritchi?
Roxanne Ritchi?

979
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:08,070
是啊 Roxanne Ritchi
Yeah,Roxanne Ritchi.

980
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:12,560
我看到她跟书呆子共进晚餐 眉来眼去的
I saw her having dinner,and making googly eyes at some intellectual dweeb.

981
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,850
谁喜欢这种破事
-Ohhhh -Who needs all that noise.

982
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:18,310
所以我觉得我们应该联手
That's why I think,WE should team up.

983
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:19,960
你?等等!什么?
You?Wait!What?

984
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:22,440
我的力量加上你的智慧
With my power,and your big headedness,

985
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,270
这城市就是我们的了
we could rule the city.

986
01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:26,940
- 你要联手? - 我还设计了我们的新造型
-You want to team up? - I even drew up some new costume designs.

987
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:28,280
- 看 - 造型?
-See -Costume design?

988
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:31,960
你负责出主意 所以衣服上有个脑子 戴副眼镜什么的
You be the brain so you get a little brain wearing glasses on your costume,or something.

989
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:36,420
因为我是老大 应该揣上两把坦克剑
And since I'm the cool one,I'll have like two tanks sword fighting.

990
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:38,620
真不敢相信
I can't believe you.

991
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:46,010
你滥用这些才能和力量 满足一己之欲
All your gifts all your powers,and you squander them for your own personal gain.

992
01:00:46,030 --> 01:00:47,640
- 是啊! - 不对!
-Yes! - NO!

993
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:52,720
我才是坏人 你是好人 我干坏事 你来阻止我
I 'm the villain,you're the good guy.I do something bad,and you come and get me.

994
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,650
所以我才创造了你
That's why I created you.

995
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:57,280
是的 没错 你是白痴
Yeah,right.You're nuts.

996
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,820
- 太空老爸告诉我 - 太空老爸就是我
-Space Dad told me. - Look,I'm your Space Dad.

997
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,590
你应该多跟都市侠学学
You should be more like Metro Man.

998
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:06,850
你耍我?
You tricked me?

999
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:08,750
不乐意了?
Oh,don't like that,huh?

1000
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:09,850
还有呢
Well there's more.

1001
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:15,170
那个和Roxanne约会的书呆子也是我
I'm also the intellectual dweeb dating Roxanne.

1002
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:19,210
- 不 - 我们还法式热吻呢
-No. - And we were smooching up a storm.

1003
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:22,190
么么...么么...么么
Mmmore...Mmmore...Mmmore.

1004
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:23,730
等我逮到你 我...
When I get my hands on you I'm gonna,...

1005
01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:25,860
来了!我知道
YES!Yes I know.

1006
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:29,680
将我绳之以法 天哪 太怀念了
Bring me to justice.Oh god,how I missed this.

1007
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:35,310
英雄先下手了
And the hero strikes the first blow.

1008
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,540
不过恶魔也会有反击
But evil returns with a backhand.

1009
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:43,340
太棒了!
YES!

1010
01:01:48,570 --> 01:01:50,520
嘘
Ahh...shhhh.

1011
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,290
滚出来 变态!
Come out you little freak!

1012
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:56,900
看我把你打得屁滚尿流
I want to see what that big brain looks like on the pavement.

1013
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:06,490
你入了本大爷的套啦
You fell for the oldest evil trick in the book.

1014
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:08,990
你这个蓝皮蠢货
You little blue,twerp.

1015
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,390
来喽!
En Garde!

1016
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:20,170
就是这种感觉
Oh,now that's the spirit.

1017
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:22,960
吃我一招 再来!
Take,that,parry again!

1018
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:26,000
该来点有技术含量的了
Now it's time for some witty back and forth banter.

1019
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,510
你先来
You go first.

1020
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:31,070
哟 我不知道这算什么招式啊
Look,I'm not sure where to go with that.

1021
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,380
这下是为了你抢走我女朋友
This one's for stealing my girlfriend.

1022
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:42,920
这下是为了太空老爸耍我
This one's for space Dad making a fool out of me.

1023
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:53,900
超级大坏蛋!这下是为了太空老妈
And Megamind!This one's for Space,Step-Mom.

1024
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:55,460
你辜负了她!
You lied to her!

1025
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:59,500
干得好 你打得好 太好了
Oh,well done,I thought that pummeling went really,really well.

1026
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,380
我 我有点小建议
I mean,I have a few notes.

1027
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:02,870
- 建议? - 不过不着急
-Notes? - But they can wait.

1028
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,330
你可以送我去监狱了
You can take me to jail now.

1029
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:07,290
不 不 不 我觉得停尸房更好
Oh,no,no,no.I was thinking more like the morgue.

1030
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:08,810
- 你死定了! - 哇 哇 哇
-You're dead! - Whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa.

1031
01:03:08,810 --> 01:03:10,570
不是这么玩儿的
This isn't how you play the game.

1032
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:12,400
游戏结束了
Game over.

1033
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:19,730
小飞虫
Brain Bots.

1034
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,030
我要休战
I'm calling time out.

1035
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:29,550
休战 休战!
Time out,time out!

1036
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:43,380
小飞虫 启动保险系统
Brain bots.Initiate the fail safe.

1037
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:52,740
没想到吧 大块头?
Guess what,Buster Brown?

1038
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:56,370
这是铜做的 这下你不行了吧
It's made from Copper.You're powerless against it.

1039
01:03:56,380 --> 01:03:58,960
可保险了 用来对付...
It's a very safe metal used to defeat...

1040
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,820
都市侠?
Metro Man?

1041
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:04,860
你别再拿我和都市侠比了
You,should stop comparing me to Metro Man.

1042
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:16,810
你跑得了一时 超级大坏蛋 可跑不了一世
You can run Megamind,but you can't hide.

1043
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:18,720
我们得救啦 我们得救啦
We're saved,we're saved!

1044
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,800
您叫什么名字 新的英雄
What's your name,new hero?

1045
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,400
- Tighten - 谢谢您 谢谢
-It's Tighten. - Thank you,thank you.

1046
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,530
Tighten解放了我们
Tighten has freed us.

1047
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:27,460
我可没说解放
Oh I wouldn't say free.

1048
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:30,720
应该说 我将带来新的秩序
More like,under new management.

1049
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,940
你想干什么
What do you want?

1050
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:41,170
- Titan走上邪路啦 - 恭喜 你又一个天才计划弄巧成拙
-Titan's turned evil. - Congratulations,another one of your genius plans has backfired on you.

1051
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,720
门卫怎么会让你上来的
And why did my doorman let you up?

1052
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:48,240
- Carlos - 你想干嘛 别关 别关
-Carlos? - What are you,no,no!

1053
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:49,350
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

1054
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:51,770
你怎么会需要我的帮助
Why do you need MY help?

1055
01:04:51,770 --> 01:04:55,780
你是我认识的最有智慧的人
Because you're the smartest person I know.

1056
01:04:57,470 --> 01:04:58,930
你不能躲在这儿
Well you can't hide here.

1057
01:04:58,930 --> 01:05:00,980
铜应该有用啊 怎么就失效了呢
Copper should have worked,why didn't the copper work?

1058
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,020
上一次明明效果超赞的
The copper worked perfectly well the last time.

1059
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:04,810
铜?你在胡说神马
Copper?You're not making any sense.

1060
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:08,570
听着 如果找不到Titan的弱点 他会把整座城市摧毁的
Look,if we don't find Titan's weakness.He'll destroy the whole city.

1061
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,830
好吧 要我怎么帮忙
Okay,how can I help?

1062
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:15,730
我们需要找到答案 你最了解都市侠
We need to find answers.You knew Metro Man best.

1063
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:20,190
他有洞穴或私人要塞那样的藏身之处吗
Did he have a hideout,a cave,a solitary fortress of some kind?

1064
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:21,970
任何线索都行
Anything that would give us clues.

1065
01:05:22,390 --> 01:05:25,360
我知道一个地方
Well,there is one place I know.

1066
01:05:27,150 --> 01:05:30,460
你给了他超能力 难道就不能收回么
You gave him these powers,can't you just take them away?

1067
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:35,150
不行 我忘记把隐形车停哪儿了 解构枪落在车里
I can't,I lost my diffuser gun when I misplaced the invisible car.

1068
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:36,940
那个晚上 你甩了我
The night you dumped me.

1069
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:39,300
让我独自一人
Alone.

1070
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,980
在雨中忧伤
In the rain.

1071
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:43,580
- 你回过头吗 - 没
-Did you ever look back? - NO!

1072
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:47,490
- 疼 我的脑瓜 - 我们想我们到了
-Oh,my giant blue head. - I guess we're here.

1073
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:53,720
这儿就是他的藏身之处
So,this is where he hid it.

1074
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:58,220
过了这么多年啊 我的鞋校
After all these years.My old shhool house.

1075
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:03,660
我觉得 我该为那天晚上的事情道歉
You know,I think there's an apology in order,for the other night.

1076
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:05,670
听起来不错 请长话短说
Okay that would be nice.But make it quick.

1077
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,840
还有很多事情要解决呢
We have much more pressing matters to deal with.

1078
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:16,320
哇 难以置信 这些东西他竟然全留着
Wow,can't believe he kept all this stuff.

1079
01:06:16,730 --> 01:06:19,520
我记得他穿那件披风
Aww,I remember when he wore that.

1080
01:06:19,530 --> 01:06:20,890
能专心点儿么
Can we try to stay focused here?

1081
01:06:20,890 --> 01:06:23,020
当然 你说的对 要专心点
Yes of course,you're right,focused.

1082
01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:26,380
嘿 过来看
HEY!Come over and look at this.

1083
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:28,470
怎么了 发现啥了
What is it?What did you find?

1084
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:32,760
呃...看
Um.....look!

1085
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:35,900
杯子里还有冰块
This glass has ice cubes in it.

1086
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:37,510
对啊 水冷的时候就会结冰
Yes,that's what happens when water gets cold.

1087
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:39,630
不对 我是想说
No,what I'm saying is,

1088
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:44,000
你不觉得没融化的冰块透着古怪吗
don't you think it's a little odd that the ice hasn't melted yet?

1089
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,630
人生之一大谜题啊
One of life's great mysteries.

1090
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:53,040
嘿
Hey.

1091
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:54,050
啊~!
AAAAAAAAH!

1092
01:07:05,070 --> 01:07:06,920
我们为您带来可靠报道
We now have a confirmed report.

1093
01:07:06,930 --> 01:07:10,930
Tighten 我们曾以为的城市新英雄 现在已成为邪恶化身
Tighten,first thought to be the City's new hero,has turned evil.

1094
01:07:10,930 --> 01:07:13,850
这座城市从未遭受如此残忍的破坏
The city has never seen this level of destruction.

1095
01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:16,310
如果都市侠还活着
If only Metro Man were still alive.

1096
01:07:16,310 --> 01:07:17,990
- 你还活着? - 你还活着
-You're alive? - You're alive.

1097
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:19,980
我还活着
I'm alive.

1098
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:22,560
但我们...看到了你的骸骨...
But..we..we saw your skeleton.

1099
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:24,730
- 你应该死了 - 你是鬼魂吗
-You were dead. - Are you a ghost?

1100
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:28,620
你最好给个万分合理的解释
There had better be,an amazing explanation for this.

1101
01:07:29,230 --> 01:07:31,200
说啊 幽灵先生
Speak,apparition.

1102
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:43,510
好吧 好吧
Okay,okay,okay,okay.

1103
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:44,940
你们应该知道真相
You both deserve the truth.

1104
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:47,490
事情要从天文台说起
It all started back at the observatory.

1105
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:51,530
Roxanne被绑架了 我要去阻止你
Roxanne was kidnapped,I was gonna stop you.

1106
01:07:52,350 --> 01:07:54,420
那天我脑抽了
My head wasn't in the game that day.

1107
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,250
我们的争斗就像走过场 所以...
We were kinda going through the motions.So...

1108
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:00,990
我用了超速能力
Using my super speed.

1109
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:02,950
决定让头脑清醒一下
I decided to go clear my head.

1110
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:10,480
随后我意识到 我们一直都在 重复而愚蠢的角色扮演
Then I realized we had done this same silly charade our entire lives.

1111
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:13,710
我想要从这种思绪中摆脱出来
I tried to get my mind off how I was feeling.

1112
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:16,270
但就是钻了牛角尖
But I just felt stuck.

1113
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:20,570
我意识到 虽然我有超能力
I began to realize,despite all my powers,

1114
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:24,100
但所有市民都拥有一样我没有的东西
each and every citizen of Metro had something I didn't.

1115
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:25,940
选择
A choice.

1116
01:08:27,110 --> 01:08:31,130
自打我记事以来 我一直是这个城市的傀儡
Ever since I can remember I've always had to be what the City wanted me to be.

1117
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:34,030
但我的梦想怎么办呢
But what about what I wanted to do?

1118
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:37,160
我茅塞顿开
Then it suddenly hit me.

1119
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:39,610
我也有选择权
I do have a choice.

1120
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:42,990
我想当什么就当什么
I can be whatever I want to be.

1121
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:45,960
没人说过我必须做一辈子的英雄
No one said this hero thing had to be a life time gig.

1122
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:48,420
你也不能就这样抽身退出啊
You can't just quit either.

1123
01:08:49,230 --> 01:08:51,400
所以我有了个绝妙的主意
That's when I got the brilliant idea...

1124
01:08:52,690 --> 01:08:54,090
假死
...to fake my death.

1125
01:08:54,570 --> 01:08:57,560
铜抑制了我的力量!
Copper drains my powers!

1126
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:00,260
你的弱点是铜?
-You're weakness is copper?

1127
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:01,600
你的死亡射线从天而降
Once your death ray hit.

1128
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:04,850
我感到前所未有的自由
I never felt so alive.

1129
01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:07,900
我从附近的护理学校里借来骷髅教具
So I borrowed a prop from a nearby nursing school.

1130
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:11,220
都市侠终于死了
Metro Man was finally dead.

1131
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:12,990
音乐男就此诞生
And Music Man was born.

1132
01:09:12,990 --> 01:09:14,120
音乐男?
Music man?

1133
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:15,590
那样我就不用改标志了
That way I can keep my logo.

1134
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:16,590
- 神马? - 你神马意思?
-WHAT? - 'Cause of what?

1135
01:09:16,590 --> 01:09:20,280
我终于自由了 还发现了我真正的力量
Finally I'm free,to get in touch with my true power.

1136
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,470
谱写音乐巨作
Weaving lyrical magic.

1137
01:09:22,470 --> 01:09:23,610
听听这个
Check this out.

1138
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:27,580
我有双眼可以看见
I have eyes that can see

1139
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:31,310
始终给我指引
right through leaaadd.

1140
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:33,780
- 糟糕透顶 - 非常高兴您还有音乐才能
-That's horrible. - Granted you have talent,

1141
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:37,490
但现在外面有个疯子在破坏 我们的...你的城市
But there's a mad man out there destroying our...your city.

1142
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:39,900
你怎么能袖手旁观
How could you do this?

1143
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:42,880
整座城市的人民都仰赖你
The people of the city relied on you,

1144
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:46,890
但你抛弃了他们 让我们成为刀俎上的鱼肉...他的!
and you deserted them.You left us in the hands of,him!

1145
01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:47,990
无意冒犯
No offense.

1146
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,150
不 我和你是一边的
No,I'm with you.

1147
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,540
听着 我们需要你的帮助
Look,we need your help.

1148
01:09:51,550 --> 01:09:54,400
我很抱歉 我真的是
I'm sorry,I really am.

1149
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,520
Um 我已经厌倦了
Um,I'm,I'm done.

1150
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:00,600
知道吗 小家伙 有阴就有阳
You know,little buddy.There's a Ying for every Yang.

1151
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,930
如果世间存有邪恶 正义必会声张
If there's bad,good will rise up against it.

1152
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:07,430
我花了很久才找到自己
It's taken me a long time to find my calling.

1153
01:10:08,110 --> 01:10:11,060
现在是时候了 找到你自己
Now it's about time,you find yours.

1154
01:10:16,290 --> 01:10:18,030
嘿 谁需要他
Hey,who needs him.

1155
01:10:18,030 --> 01:10:20,020
我们自己可以打败Tighten
We can beat Tighten ourselves.

1156
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:22,900
我说我们回恶魔巢穴 拿上雷射抢
I say we go back to the evil lair.Grab some ray guns,

1157
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:25,730
呼朋唤友 武装起来
hold them sideways,and just go all gangsta on 'em.

1158
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:27,550
我们不行
We can't

1159
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:29,790
就这样?你放弃了?
So that's it?You're just giving up?

1160
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,530
我是个坏人
I'm the bad guy.

1161
01:10:31,530 --> 01:10:35,150
我不会拯救城市 我不会迎着落日飞去
I don't save the day.I don't fly off into the sunset,

1162
01:10:35,150 --> 01:10:37,340
而且我得不到女孩的芳心
and I don't get the girl.

1163
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:39,400
我要回家了
I'm going home.

1164
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,500
除非有人伸出援手
Unless someone comes to our aid soon,

1165
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:13,380
一切将会毁灭
all may be lost.

1166
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:17,810
数以千计的市民已经逃离了这座城市
Thousands have already fled the city in a mass exodus.

1167
01:11:17,810 --> 01:11:21,950
余下的被迫在家等候进一步的消息
Remaining citizens are warned,to stay indoors until further notice.

1168
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:28,610
当局发出警告 不惜代价撤离市区
Authorities have issued a warning,to stay out of the downtown area at all costs.

1169
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:41,720
Hal!
Hal!

1170
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:44,430
Hal!
Hal!

1171
01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:49,120
我猜猜 看到我有多牛逼之后
Let me guess,after seeing how awesome I am,

1172
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,750
你终于觉悟了
you've finally come to your senses.

1173
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:52,240
我对你已经没有兴趣了
Well,I'm over you.

1174
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:54,040
我是来阻止你 Hal
I've come to stop you,Hal.

1175
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:57,740
你?哦 好吧 你要怎么做 把我给我报死?
You?Oh,well.Okay,what are you going to do,report me to death?

1176
01:11:57,740 --> 01:11:59,750
我会试着劝阻你的
I was going to try reasoning with you.

1177
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,800
你和我 我们一起工作 很长时间了
You and I,we worked together for a long time.

1178
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,220
我了解你
I know you.

1179
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:05,650
你不了解
You don't know me.

1180
01:12:05,650 --> 01:12:08,080
你从不曾花时间来了解我
You never took the time to know me.

1181
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:12,760
这是我们第一次在工作之余见面 也是我快要毁灭这座城市的时候
This is the first time we've hung out socially.And it's when I'm about to destroy the city.

1182
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:14,240
我想要和真正的Hal谈谈.
I want to talk to the real Hal.

1183
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:18,220
我要的是那个喜爱自己的职业 也喜爱吃调味料的家伙
I want to talk to the guy who loved being a camera man,and eating dip,

1184
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:21,910
有些书呆子 却没有Tighten这么恐怖
And being a nerd and being not as scary as the Tighten-Hal.

1185
01:12:21,910 --> 01:12:22,820
太晚了!
To late!

1186
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:31,250
超级大坏蛋
Megamind.

1187
01:12:33,150 --> 01:12:36,280
你和我还有帐要算
You and I have some unfinished business.

1188
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:40,710
我会等在都市塔 噢 可别临阵脱逃
I'll be waiting at Metro Tower,oh,and just so you don't get cold feet.

1189
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:43,490
Roxanne!
Roxanne!

1190
01:12:43,490 --> 01:12:47,560
来啊 Roxi 呼唤你的英雄来救你啊
Come on Roxi,call for your hero to come rescue you.

1191
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:49,800
超级大坏蛋
Megamind.

1192
01:12:51,010 --> 01:12:53,400
我甚至不知道你在不在听 如果你听到了...
I don't even know if you're listening,but if you are...

1193
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:56,010
你不能放弃
You can't give up.

1194
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:01,350
我认识的超级大坏蛋决不会临阵退缩
The Megamind I knew would never have run from a fight.

1195
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:05,080
即使他知道自己毫无胜算
Even when he knew he had absolutely no chance of winning.

1196
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,400
这是你最可贵的品质
It was your best quality.

1197
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,910
你必须站出来 就是现在
You need to be that guy,right now.

1198
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,310
这座城市需要你
The city needs you.

1199
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:18,120
我需要你
I need you.

1200
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:19,720
Roxanne．
Roxanne.

1201
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:23,980
你有一个小时 别让我等太久哦
You have one hour.Don't...keep me waiting.

1202
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,370
典狱长 典狱长!
Warden,Warden!

1203
01:13:27,370 --> 01:13:31,620
听我说 你一定要放我走 得有人去阻止Tighten
Listen to me,you have to let me go.Tighten has to be stopped.

1204
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:35,420
对不起 超级大坏蛋 你还有88个终身监禁
Sorry Megamind,you still have 88 life sentences to go.

1205
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:37,930
时间足够你来反省自己的所作所为
Plenty of time to reflect on what you've done.

1206
01:13:37,930 --> 01:13:41,450
如果你想听我说?我会说的
If you want to hear me say it?I'll say it.

1207
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:45,120
听好了 发自我内心最黑暗的地方
Here it is.From the blackest part of my heart.

1208
01:13:47,730 --> 01:13:51,580
对....不....起!
I....AM....Sorry!

1209
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:54,990
我不吃这套
Not buying it.

1210
01:13:57,390 --> 01:13:59,000
我不怪你
I don't blame you.

1211
01:14:00,260 --> 01:14:02,980
我危害城市数不清多少次了
I've terrorized the city countless times.

1212
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:06,500
创造的英雄却变成了恶棍
Created a hero who's turned out to be a villain.

1213
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:09,660
我骗了Roxanne
I lied to Roxanne.

1214
01:14:10,430 --> 01:14:13,180
我最好的朋友 Minion
My best friend,Minion.

1215
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:15,240
我却当作垃圾
I treated like dirt.

1216
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:19,400
拜托 不要让这座城市
Please,don't make this city,

1217
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:24,320
不要让 Roxanne为我的恶行负责
don't make Roxanne pay for my wrong doings.

1218
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:29,820
我接受你的道歉
Apology accepted.

1219
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:36,650
Minion 你这条给力的小鱼
Uh,Minion.You fantastic fish,you.

1220
01:14:36,650 --> 01:14:38,070
我们还在等什么?
What are we waiting for?

1221
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:39,920
我们快走吧
We'd better get going.

1222
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:43,750
你骗到我了!
You got me!

1223
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:48,130
好运 伙计
Good luck,fellows.

1224
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:49,360
我们送死去了!
We're gonna die!

1225
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:52,190
等等 什么?
Wait,what?

1226
01:14:51,690 --> 01:14:54,140
嘿 废物们
Hey,Metro losers.

1227
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:56,020
这里是 都市塔
This is Metro Tower.

1228
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:59,270
它被认为是我们城市实力的一个标志
They say it's suppose to be a symbol of our cities strength.

1229
01:14:59,270 --> 01:15:04,620
但是 对我来说 却象征着 这个女人残忍的撕碎了我的心
But,for me,it's a reminder of the day this woman ferociously ripped out my heart.

1230
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:07,160
我恨哪
And I hate reminders.

1231
01:15:20,210 --> 01:15:21,380
HAL!
HAL!

1232
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:24,910
不要这样
Please don't do this.

1233
01:15:24,910 --> 01:15:27,620
我知道你是个好人 Hal
I know there's still good in you,Hal.

1234
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:29,120
你太天真了 Roxie
You're so naive,Roxie.

1235
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:32,570
你看到了所有人的好 即使他们名不副实
You see the good in everybody,even when it's not there.

1236
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:34,440
你生活在幻想里
You're living a fantasy.

1237
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,540
没有复活节兔子
There is no Easter bunny.

1238
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:38,290
没有牙仙
There is no tooth fairy.

1239
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:40,210
也没有英格兰女王
And there is no Queen of England.

1240
01:15:40,790 --> 01:15:43,950
这是现实世界 你快觉醒吧
This is the real world.And you need to wake up.

1241
01:15:55,730 --> 01:15:59,110
你胆敢挑战 超级大坏蛋?
You dare challenge Megamind?

1242
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:02,110
一山容不得二虎
This town isn't big enough for two super villains.

1243
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:05,490
哦 你确实是个恶棍
Oh,you're a villain all right.

1244
01:16:05,490 --> 01:16:07,520
但不是最牛逼的那个
Just not a super one.

1245
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:09,290
啊 有什么区别?
Yeah,what's the difference?

1246
01:16:13,550 --> 01:16:15,230
演出开始!
PRESENTATION!

1247
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:35,900
我知道你会回来
I knew you'd come back.

1248
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:38,050
是你一厢情愿
Well,that makes one of us.

1249
01:17:04,830 --> 01:17:09,450
- 有什么计划? - 主要是 保命要紧
-What's the plan? - Well,mostly involves,not dying.

1250
01:17:09,450 --> 01:17:10,620
我 喜欢
I,like that plan.

1251
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:36,330
我失去控制了
I can't control it.

1252
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:52,570
不!
No!

1253
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,060
呵 轻而易举
Well,that was easy.

1254
01:17:57,490 --> 01:17:59,710
看来还剩一个
Looks like there's only one loose end now.

1255
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:14,020
拜托 还是对公共交通工具尊重点
Please,let's have a little respect for public transportation.

1256
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:16,480
你回来了
You came back.

1257
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:18,050
你说得对 Roxanne
You were right,Roxanne.

1258
01:18:18,050 --> 01:18:19,990
我从不该离开
I never should have left.

1259
01:18:19,990 --> 01:18:22,240
哇 我 我以为你死了
Whoa,I...I thought you were dead.

1260
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:25,530
我的死 说得太夸张了
My death was,greatly exaggerated.

1261
01:18:25,530 --> 01:18:28,910
那么 你就是那个我听到的小流氓
So,you're the punk I've heard about.

1262
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:31,640
噢!
Ah!

1263
01:18:40,110 --> 01:18:45,440
对不起 我尽力了
I'm sorry,I did the best I could.

1264

我为你骄傲
I'm so proud of you.

1265
01:18:52,850 --> 01:18:53,960
Minion?
Minion?

1266
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:57,370
惊喜!呵呵呵
Surprise!Heh,heh,heh.

1267
01:18:57,810 --> 01:19:00,100
他才是真英雄
He's the real hero.

1268
01:19:06,820 --> 01:19:08,160
超级大坏蛋
Megamind.

1269
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:11,010
要去哪里?
Going somewhere?

1270
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:13,520
监狱吗
Besides jail.

1271
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:23,070
不 不要打脸
No,not in the face man,please.

1272
01:19:23,070 --> 01:19:24,500
如果你明白什么是对的 Tighten
If you know what's good for you,Tighten.

1273
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:26,320
离开大都费
You'll stay out of Montrosity.

1274
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:27,640
- 知道了 - 很好
-You got it! - For good.

1275
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:04,460
太狡猾了 兄弟
Pretty sneaky,sis.

1276
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:08,530
我知道只有一个人会说大都费
But there is only one person I know who calls this town,Montrosity.

1277
01:20:08,530 --> 01:20:09,540
啊呀
Ooops.

1278
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:11,170
你!
You!

1279
01:20:14,270 --> 01:20:16,270
你觉得很好玩吗 嗯?
Bet you think it's really funny,huh?

1280
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:20,570
我们来看看谁才是可笑的
Let's all laugh at the really cool guy,huh.

1281
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:25,580
你不会得意太久的
You're not going to be laughing for long.

1282
01:20:26,350 --> 01:20:29,880
隐形车 嘿 记得那个我甩你的晚上吗?
The invisible car.Hey,remember that night that I dumped you?

1283
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:33,140
现在提这个干吗?
You are bringing this up now?

1284
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:34,650
我当时回头了
I did look back.

1285
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:37,350
你回头了?
You did?

1286
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:38,900
你回头了!
YOU DID!

1287
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:42,540
对 你也应该回过头 马上
Yes,and you should look back,right now.

1288
01:20:43,650 --> 01:20:45,180
Oh 我懂了
Oh,I get it.

1289
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:55,780
这是你最后一次耍我了
This is the last time you'll make a fool out of me.

1290
01:20:55,780 --> 01:20:58,220
我把你变成英雄
I made you a hero.

1291
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:01,970
是你自己搞砸了一切
You did the fool thing,all by yourself.

1292
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:10,350
你太可悲了
You're so pathetic.

1293
01:21:10,350 --> 01:21:12,170
不管你站哪一边
No matter what side you're on.

1294
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:13,980
你总是那个失败者
You're always the looser.

1295
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:16,180
有得就有失
There's a benefit to loosing.

1296
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,650
你要为你的错误付出代价
You get to learn from your mistakes.

1297
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:21,900
什么?
What?

1298
01:21:23,770 --> 01:21:25,800
哦 你是在跟我开玩笑吧!
Oh,you've got to be kidding me!

1299
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:28,180
Minion 如果我还活着 一定要杀了你
Minion,if I live,I will kill you.

1300
01:21:38,530 --> 01:21:40,330
好好享受吧
Enjoy your flight.

1301
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,090
啊 !
AAAAAAAAH!

1302
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:43,690
超级大坏蛋
Megamind.

1303
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,740
嗯 到此为止了
So,this is how it ends.

1304
01:21:54,190 --> 01:21:58,240
通常 我都会更新在我的辉煌败绩中
Normally I'd chalk this up to my last glorious failure.

1305
01:21:59,710 --> 01:22:01,020
但不是今天!
But not today!

1306
01:22:02,090 --> 01:22:03,260
我能说什么呢?
What can I say?

1307
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:05,470
狗改不了吃屎
Old habits die hard.

1308
01:22:12,110 --> 01:22:14,150
说再见吧 Roxie
Say bye,bye Roxie.

1309
01:22:18,990 --> 01:22:20,330
内好
Ollo.

1310
01:22:29,650 --> 01:22:32,750
关于坏蛋 他们永远赢不了!
Thing about bad guys,they always LOOSE!

1311
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,130
哦~
Ohhhh.

1312
01:22:37,690 --> 01:22:39,650
我们成功了 你赢了
We did it,you won.

1313
01:22:39,650 --> 01:22:42,890
最终 我找到了获胜的理由
Well,I finally had a reason to win.

1314
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:45,090
是你
You.

1315
01:22:53,390 --> 01:22:54,400

Can't see it's cold and...warm,and dark and light.

1317
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:00,750
是我 Minion
It's me,Minion.

1318
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:02,150
我在这儿
I'm right here.

1319
01:23:02,150 --> 01:23:04,160
我们一起经历多少风雨
We've had a lot of adventures together.

1320
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:05,370
你和我
You and I.

1321
01:23:05,370 --> 01:23:06,600
是的 Minion
We have,Minion.

1322
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:09,130
我说...
I mean...

1323
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:13,650
大多数以惨败告终 但
most of them ended in horrible failure,but,

1324
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:17,430
今天我们赢了 是吗 主人?
We won today.Didn't we,sir?

1325
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,960
对 Minion 我们赢了
Yes Minion,we did it.

1326
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:21,340
谢谢你
Thanks to you.

1327
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:25,300
我们是好人了
Code-We're the good guys now.

1328
01:23:25,310 --> 01:23:29,580
我想是的
Code-I guess we are.

1329
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:32,870
哦 我要去 我想...
Oh,oh.I'm going...I think this...

1330
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,600

This is it,I mean I'm going far awa...

1331
01:23:46,030 --> 01:23:47,980
哎哟 真爱演啊
Oh,what a drama queen.

1332
01:23:48,810 --> 01:23:50,570
我现在感觉好多了
You know,I'm feeling much better now.

1333
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:52,360
我想我只是需要游下泳
I guess I just needed a swim

1334
01:23:52,370 --> 01:23:54,180
- 他吓到你了 对吗 - 哇哦 !
-He had you,didn't he. - Whew!

1335
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:56,720
漂亮 Minion 别管他们
Classic,Minion.Don't give them the face.

1336
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:59,190
看他那小脸蛋儿
There he is with that little face.Look at that face.

1337
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:01,660
我们赢了!我们赢了!
We did it!We did it!

1338
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:03,780
- 给力! - 你赢了!

1339
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:05,640
我们赢啦
We won,we won,we won.

1340
01:24:05,650 --> 01:24:09,700
什么 走开点 野蛮人!
What!Get back you savages!

1341
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:13,770
抱歉抱歉 他还没习惯正面的回应
Sorry,sorry.He's just not used to positive feedback.

1342
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:21,660
真有趣 我想命运不是为我们铺好的路
Funny,I guess destiny is not the path given to us.
