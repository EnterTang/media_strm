2
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,727
to do than sit around and wait all night?
没有别的事可做吗？

3
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,004
Hey, sorry, snake,

Right, I see where you're coming from.

How much more can you get me?

Don't call me babe,

I told you about that before, I hate it.

I remember you telling me that before.

What the hell is that?

Are you sure you weren't followed?

Well, that's too bad,maybe we could start our own.
好吧，那太糟糕了，也许我们可以自己开始

00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,307
Hey, get her to shut that thing off, will ya?
嘿，让她把那东西关掉，好吗？

Hey, baby, would you mind

finishing your aerobics elsewhere?
去别的地方做你的有氧运动吗？

We're trying to conduct a little business here.

So why don't you just move on.

I said I was lookin' to party.

47
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,657
Ooh, I knew you could help me out.
哦，我就知道你可以帮我

48
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,080
Yeah, I just might let you party with me.

What's that, sweetness?
什么事，甜心？

51
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:40,083
You're busted, get your hands up now!
你被捕了，把手举起来

52
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,421
You gotta be kidding.
你开玩笑的吧

53
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:58,652
J huh


54
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,782

00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,661
j put your finger on the trigger

57
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,205
j feel it getting bigger

58
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:11,657
j move a little closer

59
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,187
j let me stick it

60
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,248

j and baby, you can cock it

64
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,430
j it's got a 12 inch length

65
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,133
j and you can make it plank

66
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,560
j blow me away, just
give it a yank

67
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,684
j let's do it

00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:38,108
j shoot my bullet

69
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,187
j when you roll up in my Levi's

70
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:46,275
j you can feel my Colt, yeah, 45

71
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,033
j got a pistol in my pocket.

72
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,868
J and baby, you can cock it

73
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,670
j it's straight from undercover

74
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,213
j but don't show it mother

75
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,585
j looking for a sexy way

76
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:02,927
j to blow my ammunition

77
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:06,086
j let's do it

78
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,138
j bite my bullet

79
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:12,343

00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:17,351

81
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:33,784
Hurry!
快点！

82
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,204
Good morning, students.
早上好，同学们

83
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,674
Good morning, miss Devonshire.
早上好，德文郡小姐

84
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,595
I see we're all here bright and early today.
我知道我们今天都很早就到了

85
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,264
Let me just take our roll call and,
让我来点名

86
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,054
yes, Holly.
霍莉

87
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,837
I'd like to say that the drug bust,
我想说缉毒行动

88
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,893
which I took on single-handedly last night,
我昨晚单枪匹马搞定了

89
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,849
went off without any flaws.
没有任何瑕疵

90
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,611
But we've never studied their set-up and operation.
但是我们从来没有研究过他们的组织和运作

91
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,690
We don't even know who their main supplier is.
我们甚至不知道他们的主要供应商是谁

92
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,275
Well, since my father is the chief of police,
好吧，既然我父亲是警察局长，

93
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,485
he did give me all the inside information
他确实把他发现的所有内幕消息

94
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,162
that he had uncovered.
都告诉了我

95
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,740
He thought that maybe if I had the case all to myself
他想，如果我一个人处理这个案子的话

96
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,576
I could pick up some extra credit in the class.
也许我可以在班上获得一些额外的学分

97
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,162
I've warned you about this before, Holly.
霍莉，我之前已经警告过你

98
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,787
What if something had gone wrong
如果出了什么差错

99
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,254
and your life would have been in danger?
你的生命有危险怎么办？

100
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:30,008
Daddy had every surrounding block manned by patrol cars,
爸爸在每个街区都有巡逻车，

101
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,713
if I had let out one little scream
如果我发出一声尖叫

102
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,578
the entire area would have been crawling
整个区域会在几秒钟内

103
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,138
with black and whites in seconds.
被黑人和白人警察包围

104
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,474
Sounds like an expensive operation
听起来要抓住一个毒贩

105
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,351
to catch one drug dealer.
花费不菲啊

106
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,274
You know, that's what daddy said,
爸爸就是这么说的

107
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,273
but after I talked it over with him,
但是我跟他讲完之后

108
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:46,614
he didn't seem to mind.
他似乎并不介意

109
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:50,111
Hm, I'll remember that next time
嗯，下次我需要向他要钱的时候

110
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,443
I need to ask him for any expenditures.
我会记得的

111
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,724
Oh, and I do have a full copy
对了，我还有一份昨晚的

112
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,205
of the report from last night.
完整报告

113
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,422
Watch where you're going!
走路看着点！

114
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,284
Why don't you say it a little louder,
你为什么不大声点说

115
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,877
I'm sure there's a few people here
我确定这里有人

116
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,549
that didn't notice we came in late.
都没注意到我们来晚了

117
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,686
You're late.
你迟到了

118
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:21,732
See what I mean.
明白我的意思了

119
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:25,856
I don't suppose any of you
我不认为你们中的任何人

120
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,437
have excuses for your tardiness.
有迟到的借口

121
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,109
Class started without us?
没等我们就开始上课了？

122
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,159
I've heard that one before.
我以前听过这句话

123
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:35,781
And you?
你呢？

124
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,783
No comment.
无可奉告

125
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:40,770
You three are going to need
你们三个

126
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,376
to show more interest in this class.
要对这门课表现出更多的兴趣

127
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,203
Showing up late is hardly any way
迟到可不是什么好事

128
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,164
of going about getting your place on the force.
并不能让你在警队里占有一席之地

129
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,561
Don't most vice arrests take place at night?
大多数逮捕罪犯不是在晚上进行的吗？

130
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,991
How is getting up early in the morning gonna do any good
当这个城市里所有的下流人都睡着了的时候

131
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,381
when all the low-life in this city is asleep?
早起又有什么好处呢？

132
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,841
Not all the low-life.
不是所有的下层人士

133
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:04,439
Vice is a 24-hour a day job.
犯罪是一天24小时的工作

134
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,391
While you were sleeping last night,
当你昨晚睡觉的时候

135
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:10,775
Holly managed to pull off an arrest all on her own.
霍莉自己成功逮捕了一个人

136
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,401
That brings her arrest quota
所以她的逮捕名额

137
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,653
to the highest of anyone in the classroom.
是全班最高的

138
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,612
Big deal, if I had an entire police force
有什么大不了的，如果我有一整支警察队伍

139
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,197
at my Beck and call,
听候差遣

140
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,533
I'd have the highest arrest quota also.
我的逮捕人数也是最多的

141
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,660
Dream on.
继续做梦

142
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,587
Just shut up already.
闭嘴吧

143
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:31,462
Girls, please, we have other things at hand today.
姑娘们，拜托，我们今天还有别的事要做

144
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,163
Now you all realize that graduation
现在你们都意识到毕业

who took the time to go out undercover every night.
每晚都花时间出去卧底的人

285
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,967
I had no idea that we shared the same interests.
我不知道我们有共同的兴趣

286
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,215
Holly, you might be going out undercover,
霍莉，你可能是去做卧底，

287
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,094
but we're just going out to have some fun.
但我们只是出去找点乐子

288
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:28,800
I should have known.
我早该知道的

289
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,261
Isn't there anything in life that's important to you?
难道生活中就没有对你重要的事情吗？

290
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:34,267
Do you just wanna have fun all the time?
你只想一直玩得开心吗？

291
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,223
Give it a rest, school's out.
休息一下，放学了

292
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,355
No, you just name one important cause
不，你只要说出一个

293
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,402
you have ever fought for!
你为之奋斗过的重要事业！

294
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,277
We once petitioned for the legalization
我们曾经请求合法化

295
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:47,109
and the decriminalization of a, nevermind!
和非犯罪化，无所谓！

296
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:49,664
Forget I asked.
当我没问

297
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,990
You're right, Holly,
你说得对，霍莉

298
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,290
we're gonna give that some serious thought
我们会认真考虑的

299
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,664
and when we think of what we can do,
当我们想到我们能做什么的时候

300
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,621
you'll be the first to know.
你会是第一个知道的

301
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,298
Well, I'm glad that you see it my way.

302
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:05,555
I do.

303
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,805
I don't understand it, daddy.

304
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,232
I have been out here for over three hours

305
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,434
and no one has even come up to me.

306
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,237
Keep at it, pumpkin, we'll get 'em.

307
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,990
Honey, we are going out tonight.

308
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,371
Yes!

309
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,327
You look really good.

310
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,733
Did you say something?

311
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,284
No.

312
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,785
Hey, are you all right?

313
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:58,741
What happened to you?

314
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,667
Leave me alone!

315
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,085
Let us help you.

316
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:03,423
How can you help me?

317
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:04,757
We're cops.

318
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,129
Are you sure you're cops?

319
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:12,255
Well, sometimes we're not even sure ourselves.

320
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,520
We're still in the academy but we can help you.

321
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,467
Just tell us what happened to you.

322
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,273
My name is cherry pop,

323
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:24,931
I ran away from home when I was 15

324
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:31,198
with a name like cherry pop, no wonder.

325
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,446
No, that's not my real name.

326
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,666
I recently tried to get out of the porno business,

327
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,953
I released my own exercise video.

328
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:41,579
"Boning up with cherry pop."

329
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:46,276
But the people I made the pornos for didn't like it,

330
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,006
they said stop making these tapes.

331
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,261
Who did this to you?

332
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:51,304
Was it one of the actors?

333
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:54,755
No, not the actors,

334
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,136
the director hired someone to do this to me.

335
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,260
And now I'll never work again!

336
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,752
Why don't you just come down to the station with us

337
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:04,776
and file a statement

338
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,476
and testify to put these people away.

339
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:10,187
No, I'm afraid of them, I can't testify!

340
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,864
They'll come after me, they'll kill me!

341
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:14,202
No, no!

342
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,654
Wait, we wanna help youl!

343
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:27,876
I hate to admit it,

344
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,424
but Holly might be right about something for once.

345
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,596
What do you mean?

346
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,010
We have to grow up already.

347
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:39,763
We can't just waste away the rest of our lives.

348
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,359
Yes, girls?

349
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,129
We're going undercover to investigate

350
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,609
phony roller derby matches.

351
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:52,484
Well, I hope those weeks of practice come in handy.

352
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:00,236
And we're gonna try and shut down a Mexican donkey show.

353
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,583
There goes my weekend.

354
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:07,707
Miss Devonshire, we heard about a porno operation

355
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,584
that hires underage girls.

356
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,205
We'd like to take a crack at it.

357
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,543
Girls, be serious.

358
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,048
No, we mean it.

359
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,551
I know the location of the company

360
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,473
and the people in charge there.

361
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:21,891
Very well then,

362
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,429
I'll give you some equipment you can use for your cover.

363
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:27,734
All right!

364
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,195
What's that?

365
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,536
It's your cover.

366
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:41,787
I'll just type your name on this phony resume

367
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:43,159
and you'll be all set.

368
00:25:56,722 --> 00:26:00,214
There, just stick a picture of yourself on the back.

369
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,719
Thank you, miss Devonshire.

370
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,680
And remember, in order to make an arrest,

371
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:06,558
you need to obtain solid evidence.

372
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:10,812
You need to catch everyone in the act.

373
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,484
Yes, I understand.

374
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,857
There is one other thing you can use.

375
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:19,150
It looks like a whore's purse.

376
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,110
But look inside.

377
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,416
It is a whore's purse.

378
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,664
No, no no, look at this.

379
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:32,496
It looks like a lipstick.

380
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,628
It may look like a lipstick but watch.

381
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:44,008
Simulated gun fire,now, watch this.

382
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,893
Wow!

383
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,650
What's that?

384
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,602
It's a portable radio,

385
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,734
but combined with these earrings,

386
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,532
it's also a receiver and transmitter.

387
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:03,076
You can talk into this earring for help

388
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,369
and listen from this one.

389
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,572
Your backup agent can wear the headphones

390
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,533
and come to your aid.

391
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:14,622
These are very expensive devices, just be careful.

392
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,634
Any questions?

393
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,678
Does it come in any other colors?

394
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,152
This is the place.

395
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,407
Thanks for coming along, Dwayne.

396
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:47,748
Yeah.

397
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,625
Well, how do I look?

398
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:55,756
On!

399
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:57,758
That good, huh?

400
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:02,803
Remember, this case is important to me.

401
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,426
I'm not just doing it for our quota.

402
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:06,802
Hey, don't worry,

403
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:09,681
with this transmitter we can hear everything that goes on.

404
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,022
Good luck.

405
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,170
God.

406
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,048
Here.

407
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:41,834
Oh, 9:30.

408
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,558
9:30.

409
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:53,898
Can I help you?

410
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:59,439
Word's out on the street you're looking for a new actress.

411
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,738
Great, get on your back and let's see what we can do.

412
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:08,156
Hey, listen, any work I do is considered a day's paycheck.

413
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:10,909
So unless you're willing to start me on payroll right now,

414
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,912
you just better keep your clothes on.

415
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:15,709
You're a pro, ar en' Ty a?

416
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,662
I'm not just off the bus from Omaha.

417
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,498
Listen, I was just kidding about the first part.

418
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,050
Really?

419
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:27,380
This is great, all we need is some solid evidence now.

420
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,661
Do you think she should have gone on the couch with him?

421
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:30,685
Shh!

422
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:35,771
I brought my resume with me,

423
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,769
it'll show you what I do best.

424
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,239
Quite impressive.

425
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:48,158
Well, I like what I do and I do it well.

426
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,822
Is there anything you wouldn't consider doing in a film?

427
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,873
Well, I don't do any animal acts.

428
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,039
Really?

429
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,621
It says here that you've done quite a few in your picture

430
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,756
"if I could talk to the animals."

431
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:06,255
Looks like you made it with half the zoo.

432
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,757
Uh, well, that was one of my earlier films.

433
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,726
Animal acts!

434
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:17,729
Who gave her that resume?

435
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,346
Miss Devonshire gave it to her.

436
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:21,058
I think she should've read it first.

437
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,821
Uh, I also don't do any s&m.

438
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:29,449
Are you sure?

439
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,243
According to this you enjoy it,

440
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:35,038
you've done everything imaginable in your picture,

441
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,865
"beat me in St. Louie."

442
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,582
That was a long time ago, I, uh,

443
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,202
I'm looking for a new image now.

444
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,820
Are you sure you want to do a picture like ours,

445
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,129
I mean it's only straight sex.

446
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:49,138
Sounds fine to me.

447
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:04,476
Wow, who's that?

448
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,295
What about your fans,

449
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,297
what if they don't like your new image?

450
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,554
Chucky, just in time.

451
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,135
Yeah, time for what?

452
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,800
I'd like you to meet the actress

453
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:42,598
who's auditioning lead opposite of you in our next film.

454
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,852
Chucky long, meet didi fluffer.

455
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:52,781
Hello.

456
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,120
Hello.

457
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,268
Didi might be replacing the actress

458
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,532
that you usually work with.

459
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:05,913
Um, what happened to the other actress?

460
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:09,500
Oh, we had to get rid of her because she turned 19.

461
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:12,719
I never thought she passed 18.

462
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,117
Hey, Chucky, since you're here,

463
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:15,756
why don't you read a scene with didi.

464
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:17,101
Yeah, how 'bout it?

465
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:19,135
I don't know, I've got a full schedule today.

466
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,082
I've got an appointment at my tanning salon

467
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,186
and then there's my facial.

468
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:24,223
Why don't you make time?

469
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:28,102
J well, if you only live in it

470
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:30,278
j everybody else will too

471
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,652
j set on out to this Mark

472
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:36,280
this thing's only 12 pages long.

473
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,829
Our films aren't about dialogue, you should know that.

474
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:41,998
Oh, yeah, right.

475
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,695
All right, why don't you go ahead

476
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,914
and start reading from the scene on page three.

477
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,289
Baby, it's been a long, hard day

478
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,090
and I'm looking for some relief.

479
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,757
It looks like you came to the right place.

480
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,218
Some things were just meant to be.

481
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:04,020
J for as long as I need

482
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,643
j come and purify the disease

483
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,816
brilliant, you got the part!

484
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,105
Oh, great, I'll do it for free.

485
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,450
What did you say?

486
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,596
I said we'll discuss my fee.

487
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,905
9:45.

488
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,640
Yeah, and I gotta get out of here,

489
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,076
unless you want me to change my stage name to Lily white.

490
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,533
Ooh, 9:45.

491
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:26,834
I'll see you on your back.

492
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,150
Congratulations,you got the part.

493
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,152
I love this job.

494
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:24,764
I wish I knew what slut this resume belonged to.

495
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,100
Sowould I, I'd like to meet her.

496
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:29,441
No.

497
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,946
If you like it now,you're gonna love it later.

498
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:42,198
If you like it now, you're gonna love it later.

499
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,739
If you like it now, you're gonna.

500
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:49,080
How you doing?

501
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,127
Um, I'm a little nervous,

502
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,671
it's been a while since
I've done one of these.

503
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,541
There's too many people in here,

504
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,467
I think I'm gonna
go in the next room

505
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,215
and read a few lines by myself.

506
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:13,687
Where did she go?

507
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,109
She said she was nervous.

508
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:17,521
She had to go in the next
room and do a few lines.

509
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:22,158
Understandable.

510
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:29,124
If you like it now,
you're gonna love it later.

511
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,918
If you like it now, you're
gonna love it later.

512
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:35,497
If you like it now, you're
gonna love it later.

513
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,682
If you like it now, you're
gonna love it later.

514
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,293
If you like it now, you're
gonna love it later.

515
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,479
If you like it now, you're
gonna love it later.

516
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:06,828
I found a book that covers
all their illegal operations.

517
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,747
Good, see if you can lift
it without anyone noticing.

518
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:16,254
No, he might look there.

519
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,210
They're waiting
for you on the set.

520
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,555
Right.

521
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,348
Noon.

522
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,199
Don't we have enough
evidence to take them yet?

523
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,564
No, not yet, we have to
catch everyone in the act.

524
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:49,204
Is it, if you like it now,
you're gonna love it later.

525
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,657
Oris it, if you like it
now, you're gonna love it...

526
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:55,914
Didi, I want you to meet
Desiree, our director.

527
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:57,256
Pleased to meet you.

528
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:59,543
Likewise, and you
probably never worked

529
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,215
for a woman director before.

530
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,657
I think it might be
a little different

531
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:05,841
than what you're used to.

532
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:08,344
Sex films used to be about women

533
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:10,300
on their knees in
a peep show booth.

534
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,761
Well, things aren't
like that anymore.

535
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:14,812
My films have a story,

536
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,562
all the women in my films
play powerful characters

537
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,813
that choose their sex partners.

538
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:21,155
You understand?

539
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:22,406
Yes.

540
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,067
Good, now take your places.

541
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:30,456
Oh, and Chucky.

542
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:31,696
Yeah?

543
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,041
In the scene,

544
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,256
I'd like you to degrade
her as much as possible.

545
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:39,246
Okay, everybody, places!

546
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,087
I wish we could
make our move already.

547
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,930
You wanna hear the latest
tape from severe tire damage?

548
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,852
Severe tire damage?

549
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,976
They're my favorite
group, put it on.

550
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:01,695
Turn it up.

551
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,407
Woo!

552
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,369
Okay, you two know
what to do, right?

553
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,456
Yeah, we got it.

554
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:26,592
"Chafed raw",
scene one, take one.

555
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:32,851
Action.

556
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,540
Who is it?

557
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,960
I wanna rape you until
you're split in two.

558
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:07,921
No, no cut!

559
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:11,255
Didi, you're supposed
to be frightened of him.

560
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,011
You're not supposed
to so goddamn anxious

561
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,092
you rip the door off the hinges.

562
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,437
Sorry.

563
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:20,055
Take it from where you left off.

564
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,529
"Chafed raw",
scene one, take two.

565
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,453
Action.

566
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:37,535
I said action, didi,
didn't you hear me?

567
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,492
Yeah, I just wanted to make
sure everybody else did, too.

568
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,299
I forgot something my
doctor told me to do.

569
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,967
Her doctor?

570
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:52,345
Hey, you never told me she
had any medical problems.

571
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:54,464
She never told
me anything either.

572
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,800
Uh, no, no, it's about my back.

573
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,432
My doctor said that I should
just stay off my feet.

574
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:01,773
I mean on my feet!

575
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:06,727
Didi, are you having
some sort of trouble today?

576
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,154
She'll be all right, won't you?

577
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,619
I'm ready for my
close-up, Mr. demille.

578
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,953
Take it from where you left off.

579
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:22,771
You shouldn't open
the door to strangers.

580
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:24,235
I'm gonna have to
teach you a lesson.

581
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,565
I wish he'd degrade her more.

582
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:04,413
I heard from one of our
sources that some vice ring

583
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:07,336
might try to crack
down on our operation.

584
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,832
You think it might
be somebody in here?

585
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,884
Do you think it might be
one of the crew members?

586
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,632
We've worked with this crew
before, we can trust them.

587
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:22,268
What about the new actress?

588
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,860
Are you kidding?

589
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,358
Wait a minute!

590
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:39,114
We forgot about didi.

591
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,749
I think we're a little late.

592
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:47,087
A little late?

593
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:02,686
All right, cut.

594
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:18,066
Freeze, you're under arrest!

595
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,659
Sorry we're late.

596
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:26,541
You lied to us, you never
had sex with any zoo animals.

597
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:28,493
Of course not, you fool.

598
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:33,210
I'm appalled at the
way you betrayed me.

599
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,129
You're no sister.

600
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:38,507
Desiree, as a director,

601
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:42,511
you have a lot to learn
about a woman's needs.

602
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:43,887
A vice cop?

603
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,093
I feel used and violated.

604
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,476
Shut up, Chucky.

605
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,978
Yeah, well I faked
my orgasm for you.

606
00:42:56,657 --> 00:43:01,026
Shut up, I might be able
to Grant you full immunity.

607
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,326
All right, everybody outside.

608
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:12,464
Come on!

609
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,554
You're coming with me.

610
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:41,125
Didi, there's something
I've got to ask you.

611
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:42,244
Sure, what is it?

612
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:44,994
Was it good?

613
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,538
Huh, the best!

614
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,619
Oops, I forgot something.

615
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:10,679
Come on, put
your hands up, come on.

616
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:17,769
Put your hands up.

617
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:06,067
What are we doing at your place?

618
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:07,412
You'll see.

619
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,784
Well, what're
you gonna do to me now?

620
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:20,088
Time to get back to work!

621
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:25,674
All right, scene two, take one!

622
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:27,415
You've got to be kidding.

623
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:33,887
Ooh, oh, Chucky, scene
one, take two, take three!

624
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:36,848
Wait, I need some rest.

625
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,564
Scene two, take one!

626
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:46,650
Scene five, six, seven!

627
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:48,780
Oh, scene two, three, four!

628
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:51,831
Oh, okay.

629
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:54,626
Oh.

630
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:02,582
After today I bet
we're finally gonna get

631
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:05,464
the kind of respect we
deserve around here.

632
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,553
Oh, don't look now,
but here comes Holly.

633
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:13,851
Good, she can be
the first to hear.

634
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:19,063
Holly, you know you're not
supposed to come to school

635
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,818
in the clothes your boyfriend
makes you dress up in.

636
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:24,315
For your information, didi,

637
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:26,092
while you were sleeping
in this morning,

638
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,192
I was busy breaking up a high
school narcotics operation.

639
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:30,777
Is that so?

640
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:33,033
How many arrests did you make?

641
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:34,374
Four.

642
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:36,703
Ha, while you were
busting freshmen,

643
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:41,083
we made twice as many arrests
cracking a porno operation.

644
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:42,880
A porno operation?

645
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,798
How did you hear about that?

646
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:47,422
I have my sources, too.

647
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:49,879
Really, what sources?

648
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,464
You'll find out,

649
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:55,677
just watch and see who's going
to be teacher's pet today.

650
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:58,229
In fact, here she comes now.

651
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:03,547
Miss Devonshire,
would you like to hear

652
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:05,132
about the arrests that
I made this morning?

653
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:06,996
I got two high school
seniors for dealing drugs

654
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:08,773
and another two for
writing obscenities

655
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:10,198
on the bathroom wall.

656
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,742
Later, Holly.

657
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,991
Didi, I got a
report this morning.

658
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:18,370
It had something on it
that was so unbelievable

659
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:20,747
I had to hear it
from you myself.

660
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,168
What is it?

661
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:26,840
You infiltrated that porno
ring yesterday, didn't you?

662
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:28,178
Yes.

663
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:30,173
Well, here's what I'm
having trouble with.

664
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,630
It says that before
you made the arrest,

665
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:36,934
you had sex with a male lead
in front of the entire crew.

666
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,271
Now is that true?

667
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:39,606
Well, yeah.

668
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:41,935
How could you be so stupid,

669
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,156
don't you realize we can't
put these people away

670
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,817
until we get a conviction?

671
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:47,755
How is your testimony
going look in court

672
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:49,772
when it comes out that
you performed a sex act

673
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,982
before you made the arrest?

674
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:53,568
Well, I don't know.

675
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:54,913
It's worthless,

676
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,363
you might as well let
these people go right now.

677
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:01,166
No jury is going to convict
them based on your testimony.

678
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,621
Miss Devonshire, I don't think

679
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,671
you can blame didi
entirely for this,

680
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,467
we're also to blame.

681
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:13,171
Yeah, we were
late making arrests.

682
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:15,848
She had the choice between
blowing her cover or blowing...

683
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:18,221
Shawnee, that will be enough!

684
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,894
You three are a disgrace
to the entire academy.

685
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:23,066
Go on, didi, tell us

686
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:25,691
how you were going to
be teacher's pet today.

687
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,859
Shut up, Holly.

688
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:29,197
No, go on,

689
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,606
I only had to do a few
cheers for my cover,

690
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:33,361
what did you have to do?

691
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:34,817
You're right, Holly,

692
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,403
I should have left
the case for you,

693
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:41,832
you make a much better
whore than anyone in class.

694
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,169
Ooh!

695
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:04,104
Girls, break it up!

696
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,447
This is against academy rules.

697
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:35,544
Watch out for the tires!

698
00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:00,198
Girls, girls, break it up!

699
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:01,904
Cheap trash!

700
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,249
Spoiled brat!

701
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:04,873
That will be enough!

702
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:08,954
Didi, shawnee, Dwayne, I have
a special assignment for you.

703
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:11,254
You three realize that
since you can't get

704
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:13,002
a conviction on this case,

705
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:16,336
I can't count it against
your quota of 10 arrests.

706
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,200
That's not fair,
we made the arrests.

707
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:22,008
But since tomorrow
is graduation,

708
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:25,766
I'll give you one last
chance to make your quota.

709
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:29,269
But you have to do it
completely by the book.

710
00:50:30,903 --> 00:50:33,986
There is a prostitution
ring working the inner city.

711
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:38,111
If you crack it, make the
arrests, and close them down,

712
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:42,036
you will be allowed to graduate
tomorrow with the others,

713
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:43,373
that's the deal.

714
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:46,202
You have 18 hours, good luck.

715
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:54,749
Miss Devonshire, I
couldn't help overhearing,

716
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:56,934
my father's been working
on the inner city ring

717
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,089
for quite some time now.

718
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,261
It's one of the queen
bee's operations,

719
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,635
every time he sends an
officer out on the job,

720
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:04,092
they never come back.

721
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:05,721
He's lost five already.

722
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:08,725
Yes, I know.

723
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:16,945
I better let that group
in the porno movie go.

724
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:19,319
We can't keep them
here any longer.

725
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:33,590
Excuse me.

726
00:51:33,674 --> 00:51:34,674
Yes?

727
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:39,797
Well, speak up.

728
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:42,054
I heard on the street

729
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:44,723
that you arrested some
people making a porno movie.

730
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,847
It's true, I was just
about to let them go.

731
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,644
Because of a
technicality though,

732
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:52,598
we can't get a
conviction against them.

733
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,355
That won't be necessary,

734
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:57,687
I'm willing to
testify against them.

735
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:02,732
This book will
back up everything

736
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:04,110
I have to say against them.

737
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,254
I don't know how we're gonna

738
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,438
pull this thing off in time.

739
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:40,066
Graduation's tomorrow morning!

740
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,113
Don't worry, we have all night.

741
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:43,451
Look, there's one now.

742
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:53,336
Let's get to it.

743
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,307
Remember, you gotta
get her to say a price

744
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:56,587
before you can arrest her.

745
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,840
Right.

746
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:14,357
Watch this.

747
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:24,194
Hi, there, what's your name?

748
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:26,992
Hi, my name's tinsel.

749
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:28,329
That's a pretty name.

750
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,453
Oh, thank you.

751
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:31,871
I just happened to notice

752
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:33,436
you were standing
here all by yourself

753
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:36,702
and I thought maybe you
could use some company.

754
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:40,665
Oh, that's generous of
you, I like that type.

755
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:42,821
Why don't you give me an idea

756
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:44,130
on how generous I need to be.

757
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:48,547
Well, why don't you tell me.

758
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:51,008
I asked you first.

759
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:00,980
Hi, how ya doing?

760
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:06,069
He's doing fine and I'm busy,

761
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:09,026
so why don't you
find your own block.

762
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:10,861
Listen, whatever
she's charging you,

763
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:15,165
I'll do the same and throw
in a continental breakfast.

764
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,582
What?

765
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,080
Continental breakfast?

766
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:21,459
That's right, I'll
make it all by myself.

767
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:24,154
Hey, look, what are
you lookin' for tonight,

768
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:25,839
a good time or short order cook?

769
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:28,461
What comes with this breakfast?

770
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:33,013
Eggs, muffins, and
fresh squeezed juice.

771
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:35,560
Oh, this is ridiculous.

772
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:37,338
I'll make 'em any
way you like 'em,

773
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:40,975
hard-boiled, scrambled,
or over-easy.

774
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,320
Hey, look, honey,

775
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,129
I'm sorry your waitress
job laid you off,

776
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:46,484
but this is my block.

777
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:48,861
Enterprise is the American way.

778
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:50,203
Which one of us?

779
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,866
All right, I'll throw
in a dozen donuts.

780
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:55,368
Mm, glazed?

781
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,700
Huh, whatever
she's charging you,

782
00:54:58,045 --> 00:54:59,956
I'll do it for 10 dollars less.

783
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,663
Why now that's
hitting below the belt.

784
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,088
Well, how much are you?

785
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:06,545
Well, I'm usually 40 bucks,

786
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:09,629
but I'll make an exception
and do it for 30.

787
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,213
What do you think of that?

788
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:12,843
Okay, we're vice cops.

789
00:55:13,185 --> 00:55:14,345
You're under arrest.

790
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:15,888
What?

791
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:18,721
I don't know how to cook
any of those things either.

792
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:21,307
Oh, you stinkin' piece
of trash, you tricked me.

793
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:23,643
You'll never get away with it.

794
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,067
Save it for the judge.

795
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:35,912
How'd it go?

796
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:39,367
Beautiful, we did
everything by the book.

797
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:41,151
Hey, you're just
wasting your time.

798
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:42,661
I'll be back out on the streets

799
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:45,543
before you even get a chance
to get around the block.

800
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:50,253
By the time you get out you'll
be too old to do phone sex.

801
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,258
You watch what
you're saying, you...

802
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,009
Get in there!

803
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:00,433
Hey, look, there's another one.

804
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:09,313
Let's see how fast
we can bust this one.

805
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:25,166
You working tonight or
just watching the stars?

806
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:29,962
The only time I watch the
stars is when I'm on my back.

807
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:32,511
That's a good position.

808
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,387
Watch out, sparkle, it's a trap.

809
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,473
Hey, keep it to yourself.

810
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:48,523
You ready to go
gaze at some stars?

811
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:52,277
I couldn't help overhearing,

812
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:55,280
I have a telescope at my place.

813
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:57,577
Why don't you come
home with me instead.

814
00:56:57,915 --> 00:56:59,951
What the hell is this?

815
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:01,623
I've never seen you here before.

816
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,951
That's because when you're good,

817
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:06,878
you don't spend much
time out on the streets.

818
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:10,378
Yeah, well, you don't
know who you're talkin' to.

819
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:14,052
What'll it be, I'd love to
see the big Dipper tonight.

820
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,130
Well, what kind of
telescope do you have?

821
00:57:17,476 --> 00:57:18,476
Hey, screw this.

822
00:57:18,727 --> 00:57:21,013
Hey, I'm $40, do
you want it or not?

823
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:22,435
Yeah, I want it.

824
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:24,513
You're under arrest!

825
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,723
Hey, you tricked me.

826
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:28,479
Honey, you must be good

827
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,006
because you're not gonna
be spending much time out

828
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:31,816
on the street either.

829
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:33,157
Uh, no!

830
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:36,825
Ow, ow, hey, ow, ow!

831
00:57:40,749 --> 00:57:42,580
Oh, tinsel, they got you, too?

832
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:45,127
Oh.

833
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:47,119
Join the party.

834
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,424
Nice.

835
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,435
Cheap floozies.

836
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:09,857
They're like scum.

837
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:11,310
Two-bit con artists.

838
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:13,065
Shut up back there!

839
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:14,447
Oh!

840
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,461
This is easier than
I thought it would be.

841
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,528
What we need to do is

842
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,309
to start picking
them up in quantity.

843
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:20,538
How do we do that?

844
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:22,549
Well, this one at a
time stuff's all right,

845
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,493
but I'm sure there's a
whole group of people

846
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:26,166
somewhere all in one place.

847
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,210
All we need to do is find
them and make one big arrest.

848
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:31,163
That's great if
we can find them.

849
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:33,669
We will, come on, let's go.

850
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:01,693
Look, there it is,
a laundromat posing

851
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,620
as a front for prostitution.

852
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,865
Oh, no, they found it!

853
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:22,631
I think I need a
special cover for this.

854
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:31,273
Hello, girls, I'm
looking to party.

855
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,771
I have a lot of money, here!

856
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:35,727
How much are we talkin' about?

857
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,154
I am looking for good prices.

858
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:41,653
You can have us all for $150.

859
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:47,327
Up against the wall, spread 'em.

860
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:49,460
Say what?

861
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:51,754
Look, here he comes.

862
00:59:56,802 --> 00:59:57,882
Ow!

863
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:03,672
Get in there.

864
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:10,269
Sparkle, tinsel?

865
01:00:10,482 --> 01:00:12,723
Save the reunion for later.

866
01:00:13,902 --> 01:00:15,142
We're half-way there.

867
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,487
What about the Johns?

868
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:17,799
You have to go to the bathroom?

869
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:19,300
No, now that the
laundromat is empty,

870
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:22,066
didi and I can take over and
arrest some of their customers.

871
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:24,241
Yeah, we can make
our quota right here.

872
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:25,159
Get to it.

873
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:26,497
Yeah!

874
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:38,707
Girls, it's okay
of you wanna struggle

875
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:41,589
and try to get loose,
I like to watch.

876
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:43,466
Pervert!

877
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:49,726
What do we do now?

878
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:51,303
Look like we mean business.

879
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:05,446
Oh, I'm just looking for change.

880
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:12,453
I think you came
to the right place.

881
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:14,534
So what are you doing?

882
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:15,880
My laundry.

883
01:01:16,882 --> 01:01:18,162
Aren't you supposed to take off

884
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:19,698
all your clothes
before you wash 'em?

885
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:23,589
Sometimes, but I like
to do two things at once.

886
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:24,930
Really?

887
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:29,266
So what brings you here?

888
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:31,468
A hot rinse, a fast tumble,

889
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:33,474
or something on the
more delicate side?

890
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:36,335
Gee, I don't know,
what'll this get me?

891
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,441
Ooh, that will get me
to wash all my clothes.

892
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:43,864
So can we go in one
of the rooms in back?

893
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:45,782
Sounds like you've
been here before.

894
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:49,368
I think the back's
a little crowded,

895
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,071
why don't we just
do it right here?

896
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,783
Right here, in
front of everybody?

897
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:56,914
Don't worry, we'll have privacy.

898
01:01:58,632 --> 01:01:59,632
A laundry bag?

899
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:03,633
There's plenty of room, look.

900
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,006
Now why don't you just join me.

901
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:08,682
All right.

902
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:13,681
Here, you put it in place
while I get to work, huh?

903
01:02:16,775 --> 01:02:17,815
Hey, what are you doing?

904
01:02:17,943 --> 01:02:19,063
You're under arrest, bozo!

905
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,230
This, this is entrapment.

906
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,732
Huh, yeah and it
worked real well.

907
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:27,749
I'll check the back to
see if we got 'em all.

908
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:29,575
Good, I'll take him outside.

909
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:39,585
Open up the back,
I got another one.

910
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:41,129
That was fast.

911
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:43,467
She's got a tire iron!

912
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:52,094
Uh, Dwayne, help, Dwayne!

913
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:52,890
I'm trying.

914
01:02:53,228 --> 01:02:54,228
Help, Dwayne!

915
01:02:54,396 --> 01:02:55,516
Get her, get her.

916
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:58,062
Hey, get the keys
to these damn things.

917
01:03:03,238 --> 01:03:05,024
I got 'em, I got 'em!

918
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:12,265
Let's take them
back to our warehouse

919
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:14,621
around the corner, we'll
take care of them there.

920
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:28,197
You're tampering
with police business.

921
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:29,711
You can't get away with this.

922
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:33,156
Just shut it up already!

923
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:08,129
Oh, call a tow truck.

924
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:18,847
Welcome to a theater

925
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:20,474
that's been closed for 50 years.

926
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:21,815
Hello?

927
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:23,627
Oh, Chuck, we were in
the middle of an arrest

928
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:24,265
and something went wrong,

929
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:25,851
they've got shawnee and Dwayne.

930
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:27,187
I need your help to save them.

931
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,760
Oh, yeah, how am
I supposed to help?

932
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:30,568
You left me
handcuffed to the bed.

933
01:04:30,909 --> 01:04:32,509
I left you the key
under the telephone,

934
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:33,775
I thought you'd find it by now.

935
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,530
When the lights go down,

936
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:39,785
the body count goes up.

937
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:41,741
Great, thanks a lot,

938
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:44,203
now I'll see if I can
walk after last night.

939
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:47,038
Chucky, please
don't let me down.

940
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:50,046
They took them to a warehouse
near cahuenga and lankershim.

941
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:52,877
Meet me there as
soon as you can.

942
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,175
Okay, okay, goodbye.

943
01:04:57,394 --> 01:04:58,759
I mean, right now.

944
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:18,497
Help, help,

945
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:20,999
help, help!

946
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:24,329
You can yell all you want

947
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:26,662
'cause there ain't
nobody around to hear ya.

948
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:34,002
Oh, Chucky,
I'm so glad you're here.

949
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:36,283
You know, I don't know
why I'm doing this for you.

950
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:37,907
There's something
I wanted to tell you.

951
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:39,258
What is it?

952
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:41,263
Well, this is kind
of awkward for me.

953
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,971
Even though I only
find you attractive

954
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:46,931
on a strictly physical level

955
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:49,734
and I could never take you
home to meet my parents,

956
01:05:50,738 --> 01:05:52,103
I still think I love you.

957
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:54,905
I sorta feel the
same way about you.

958
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:03,619
There's one other thing.

959
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:04,960
What?

960
01:06:05,295 --> 01:06:07,786
I lied to you before, I
didn't fake my orgasm for you.

961
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:11,297
I kinda figured that
one out on my own.

962
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:14,094
Come on, let's go.

963
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:26,106
Follow me.

964
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:34,490
Okay, this way.

965
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:43,155
The queen bee will see you now.

966
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:00,175
Now just be quiet and wait.

967
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:28,332
So you're the two that thought

968
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:31,082
that you could
crack my crime ring?

969
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:34,873
But you didn't expect to run up

970
01:07:34,968 --> 01:07:36,378
against the queen
bee, now did you?

971
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:38,960
Who?

972
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:40,761
The queen bee.

973
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:44,134
Are we supposed to know you?

974
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:47,723
The queen bee,
the one who runs all

975
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:51,682
these inner city drug
and prostitution rings.

976
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:53,186
Don't recognize the name.

977
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:56,895
I thought you
said they were cops.

978
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,440
Well, that's what I thought.

979
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:02,942
Miss bee, we're
not police officers,

980
01:08:03,288 --> 01:08:05,995
we're students at
the vice academy.

981
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:07,412
The academy, the academy?

982
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:13,211
These people are rookies.

983
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:23,721
Your people cost
me a thousand dollars

984
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:25,578
and I'm gonna take
it out of your hide.

985
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:29,265
And from what I can see
now, you're about 950 short.

986
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:34,691
Didn't you realize
that our police force

987
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:38,316
has already sent out
five undercover agents

988
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:41,648
to pose as hookers in my ring.

989
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:46,282
We captured all five and we
haven't heard from them since.

990
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:48,373
What happened to them?

991
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:56,129
Well, we sent them overseas.

992
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:59,629
We sold them into white slavery.

993
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:01,129
They don't bother me anymore

994
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:05,463
and soon you'll join
them, very soon.

995
01:09:06,768 --> 01:09:08,099
What about me?

996
01:09:08,436 --> 01:09:09,676
What about you?

997
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:13,388
Oh, we have a special
assignment for you.

998
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:16,520
We need someone to watch
over all of those girls.

999
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:19,022
That's something I think
you could do quite well.

1000
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:21,025
Watch a group of girls,

1001
01:09:21,366 --> 01:09:23,402
that doesn't sound so bad,
I might even enjoy it.

1002
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:27,986
I doubt that,

1003
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:31,323
because first we're
going to castrate you.

1004
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:36,202
Help, somebody help us!

1005
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:42,126
Scream all you want,
no one can help you now.

1006
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,499
You can't capture
that entire group,

1007
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:53,040
you might as well
call the police now

1008
01:09:53,064 --> 01:09:54,395
before we get caught also.

1009
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:56,097
You heard what she'd do to us,

1010
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:59,275
there are some things a man
won't sacrifice, no matter what.

1011
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:00,812
Chucky, it's no time to talk

1012
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:03,692
about major surgery,
I have a plan.

1013
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:05,148
A plan, right.

1014
01:10:05,493 --> 01:10:08,951
I still have a few
tricks left up my sleeve,

1015
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:10,288
just trust me.

1016
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:13,490
Okay, now I want you to
make a tape recording

1017
01:10:13,835 --> 01:10:17,202
of you sounding like a police
officer arresting everybody.

1018
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:18,547
Now go on, try it.

1019
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:21,967
This is the police chief,
you're all under arrest.

1020
01:10:22,427 --> 01:10:25,214
No, no, no, make it
sound more convincing.

1021
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:28,718
Use the voice that you
use in your movies.

1022
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:31,078
This is the police chief,
you're all under arrest.

1023
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:32,142
Put your hands in the air,

1024
01:10:32,437 --> 01:10:33,747
you have the right
to remain silent,

1025
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:34,886
don't move or we'll shoot.

1026
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:36,511
We have the building surrounded.

1027
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:38,460
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

1028
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:39,849
in a court of law.

1029
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:42,606
Don't try to escape, we're
sending for backup units.

1030
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:45,529
That was great, where'd
you learn to say all that?

1031
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:47,403
Oh, I've been
arrested a few times.

1032
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:50,827
Hmm, hurry, we got to
get back to where we were

1033
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:52,244
before the tape starts.

1034
01:10:55,126 --> 01:10:58,334
Oh, get those shipping
crates over here, will you?

1035
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:01,037
And don't forget to punch
some holes in them this time

1036
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:04,215
so they don't suffocate
like the last group.

1037
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:07,531
This is the police chief,

1038
01:11:07,555 --> 01:11:08,590
you're all under arrest.

1039
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,592
What the hell is that?

1040
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:12,298
It's a trick, queen bee.

1041
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:14,133
Yeah, pack these two up.

1042
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:16,665
Put your hands in the air,

1043
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:17,804
don't move or we'll shoot.

1044
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:23,276
It is a trick, they wouldn't
shoot with two hostages.

1045
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:31,140
This is no time
to fix your make-up.

1046
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:32,319
Sh!

1047
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:40,376
Oh my god, I forgot,
they're rookies,

1048
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:41,753
they'll shoot at anything.

1049
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:44,526
We have the place surrounded,

1050
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:45,903
you have the right
to remain silent.

1051
01:11:45,927 --> 01:11:47,918
What do we do now, queen bee?

1052
01:11:48,262 --> 01:11:50,469
This place is a
honeycomb of mazes,

1053
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:53,469
they'll never catch
us, follow me.

1054
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:56,413
Don't try to escape,

1055
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:58,473
we're sending backup units.

1056
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:29,713
Listen to that!

1057
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:31,419
Which way now?

1058
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:33,345
This way, b-girls.

1059
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:44,390
Didi, how'd you find us?

1060
01:12:44,735 --> 01:12:47,272
Never mind, we have to catch
them before they get away.

1061
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:48,613
What's he doing here?

1062
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:50,456
He was the only one I
could call to help us.

1063
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:52,023
What's he done so far?

1064
01:12:53,286 --> 01:12:55,368
Don't move or we'll shoot.

1065
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:56,740
Good work.

1066
01:12:57,081 --> 01:12:59,441
Hurry, we have to get them
before they find their way out.

1067
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:19,716
I thought you said this
place was a maze of honeycombs.

1068
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:23,187
I am the queen bee
not the maze keeper!

1069
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:25,480
This must be the way out.

1070
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:33,992
Hurry, girls.

1071
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:39,578
Faster, b-girls, faster!

1072
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:47,370
Hey, how did you get untied?

1073
01:13:47,715 --> 01:13:49,296
It's a professional secret.

1074
01:13:49,634 --> 01:13:51,594
Oh, yeah, well, what
kind of professional secret

1075
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:52,761
have you got for this?

1076
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:55,378
(Gun clicking

1077
01:14:08,361 --> 01:14:09,476
Dwayne, Dwayne!

1078
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:16,486
Dwayne, the pressure point!

1079
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:29,875
I thought we were gonna
do everything by the book.

1080
01:14:30,216 --> 01:14:32,207
We are, I'm just
using a different book.

1081
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:42,435
Follow me.

1082
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:56,314
Chucky long, it's you!

1083
01:14:58,953 --> 01:15:01,615
Oh, mr, long, I'm
your biggest fan.

1084
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:06,824
You can have it for free.

1085
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:10,290
You like it kinky?

1086
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:15,917
Does the queen
bee sleep on her back?

1087
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:36,737
Now, wait here while
we catch the others.

1088
01:15:37,074 --> 01:15:40,362
Damn you!

1089
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:41,722
This is the last
time I ever spend

1090
01:15:41,746 --> 01:15:43,156
a quarter to see
one of your films!

1091
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:48,453
What the hell happened to you?

1092
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:50,284
Sparkle, how did
you get handcuffed?

1093
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:54,338
Oh, never mind, it was
just a brief infatuation.

1094
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,340
Come on, come on, come on!

1095
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:11,434
What happened to you?

1096
01:16:11,776 --> 01:16:15,189
I don't know, when
that girl took off her blouse,

1097
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:18,487
it had an effect on me like
I never experienced before.

1098
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:19,824
Oh, really?

1099
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:22,571
Well, we'll have to
discuss it, later!

1100
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:45,180
This must be the way out.

1101
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:04,609
Something's wrong!

1102
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:08,706
Go!

1103
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:20,051
Didi!

1104
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:21,761
Yeah!

1105
01:17:21,929 --> 01:17:23,135
Oh, great we got them!

1106
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:26,714
Oh, Chucky, we couldn't
have done it without you!

1107
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:28,549
Hey, wait, what time is it?

1108
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:30,350
It's after seven in the morning!

1109
01:17:30,688 --> 01:17:32,519
Hurry, we're gonna
miss graduation.

1110
01:17:35,943 --> 01:17:37,399
Come on!

1111
01:17:38,529 --> 01:17:39,529
Go!

1112
01:19:00,361 --> 01:19:03,398
Congratulations on
your commencement.

1113
01:19:04,782 --> 01:19:07,740
Graduating the vice
academy is an honor

1114
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:11,160
that only we can
bestow upon you.

1115
01:19:12,706 --> 01:19:15,698
Soon you will be
working hand in hand

1116
01:19:16,043 --> 01:19:19,035
as proud members of
the police force.

1117
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:20,790
Cleaning up our streets

1118
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:24,294
of all the sleaze,
slime, and filth,

1119
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:28,176
that make our academy strong.

1120
01:19:29,848 --> 01:19:32,931
And now, police chief Wells
would like to say a few words.

1121
01:19:45,656 --> 01:19:46,816
Thank you very much

1122
01:19:47,157 --> 01:19:51,025
for those very kind
words, miss Devonshire.

1123
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:55,454
You said them just the
way I had them written.

1124
01:20:00,504 --> 01:20:03,792
I'm especially proud
of my daughter Holly,

1125
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:05,714
and all of you for that matter.

1126
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:16,593
Faster, didi, faster!

1127
01:20:17,855 --> 01:20:19,846
Of the glorious graduates...

1128
01:20:26,113 --> 01:20:27,978
Miss Devonshire, wait!

1129
01:20:28,991 --> 01:20:30,856
What in the world?

1130
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:34,614
You can't start
graduation without us!

1131
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:36,911
How dare you interrupt
my father's speech.

1132
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:38,534
Shut up, you'll wanna see this.

1133
01:21:07,363 --> 01:21:08,694
I don't believe it.

1134
01:21:09,031 --> 01:21:11,238
The queen bee,
my own police force

1135
01:21:11,575 --> 01:21:12,985
hasn't been able
to bring her in.

1136
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:16,034
Yes, I know, we
got them to confess

1137
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:17,772
to where they had
all of your agents

1138
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:20,698
that they'd previously captured.

1139
01:21:21,043 --> 01:21:24,786
This is the greatest sting
operation I've ever seen.

1140
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:28,622
Better than anything my own
police officers have ever done,

1141
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:32,209
better than anything my
own daughter is capable of.

1142
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:35,261
Daddy, how could you?

1143
01:21:35,599 --> 01:21:36,599
Oh, but, pumpkin...

1144
01:21:36,934 --> 01:21:37,934
Don't touch Mel

1145
01:21:38,185 --> 01:21:38,640
Princess.

1146
01:21:38,977 --> 01:21:39,977
Just leave me alone.

1147
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:43,763
A-ha, just as I thought!

1148
01:21:44,108 --> 01:21:45,108
What?

1149
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:48,108
There are only nine
people in the Van,

1150
01:21:48,445 --> 01:21:51,778
their quota was 10 and
they failed to meet it.

1151
01:21:52,116 --> 01:21:53,116
But...

1152
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:54,989
You know as well as I

1153
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:57,568
that they can't be
allowed to graduate.

1154
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:00,120
But surely you can make
an exception in this case.

1155
01:22:00,457 --> 01:22:02,573
The queen bee
should count double.

1156
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:04,876
Literally.

1157
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:07,790
We do things by
the book around here.

1158
01:22:08,132 --> 01:22:10,919
The requirement was 10 and
they failed to meet it.

1159
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:13,671
I'm afraid she's right,

1160
01:22:15,222 --> 01:22:16,302
the requirement is 10.

1161
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:18,766
I'm very sorry.

1162
01:22:19,726 --> 01:22:21,933
You forgot to
count me, it is 10.

1163
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:23,456
Chucky, what are you doing?

1164
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:24,970
Be quiet, I owe you.

1165
01:22:25,315 --> 01:22:26,709
Why aren't you in the
back with the rest of them?

1166
01:22:26,733 --> 01:22:28,974
They let me in front on
account of good behavior.

1167
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:34,814
Chucky, how can
I ever repay you?

1168
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:36,159
Post my bail.

1169
01:22:36,452 --> 01:22:39,034
It looks like you
three are graduating.

1170
01:22:39,371 --> 01:22:40,827
Please reconsider,

1171
01:22:41,165 --> 01:22:43,326
this one can't even
keep her clothes on.

1172
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:45,547
This is the most arrests
we've had at one time

1173
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:48,289
since we booked that
group in the porno movie.

1174
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:50,416
We were the ones who
brought in that group.

1175
01:22:50,757 --> 01:22:51,997
But since miss Devonshire said

1176
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:53,582
that we couldn't convict 'em,

1177
01:22:53,927 --> 01:22:55,838
it wouldn't count
against our quota.

1178
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:57,340
What are you talking about?

1179
01:22:57,598 --> 01:22:59,805
We had a witness come
in here yesterday.

1180
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:01,494
We've got a conviction
that's good enough

1181
01:23:01,518 --> 01:23:04,055
to put the whole group
away for some time.

1182
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:04,976
What?

1183
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:07,350
Oh, didn't I mention that?

1184
01:23:09,193 --> 01:23:10,193
Hi, you guys.

1185
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:11,650
- Cherry pop!
- Hi, cherry!

1186
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:15,696
We have good news,
we're graduating!

1187
01:23:16,033 --> 01:23:17,033
I have good news, too,

1188
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:18,766
my exercise video
just went platinum!

1189
01:23:28,462 --> 01:23:30,123
- Get outta town!
- God.

1190
01:23:31,798 --> 01:23:35,757
Oh, let me see now, our
arrest quota is actually 20,

1191
01:23:37,179 --> 01:23:38,899
that's the highest in
the academy's history,

1192
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:40,341
do you know what that means?

1193
01:23:57,866 --> 01:24:00,573
Congratulations on
a job well done.

1194
01:24:05,999 --> 01:24:07,159
Thank you, sir.

1195
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:10,294
Thank you.

1196
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:13,294
How's it feel
watching us graduate

1197
01:24:13,632 --> 01:24:15,998
when there's nothing
you can do about it?

1198
01:24:17,427 --> 01:24:19,338
Let's hear it for
our valedictorians!

1199
01:24:35,654 --> 01:24:38,396
So, is there really money
in making exercise videos?

1200
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,025
Are you kidding,

1201
01:24:40,367 --> 01:24:43,404
at this rate I'll be able
to retire at 18.

1202
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:46,282
This could be the new career
move I've been looking for.

1203
01:24:46,623 --> 01:24:49,786
Hmm, "pump it up with Chucky
long," got a nice ring to it.

1204
01:24:52,713 --> 01:24:55,546
Come, miss Devonshire, we
have a trip to make downtown.

1205
01:25:11,273 --> 01:25:12,633
You know, I have
to give you credit

1206
01:25:12,858 --> 01:25:14,519
for your class this semester.

1207
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:16,316
I'm sure your
three prized pupils

1208
01:25:16,653 --> 01:25:18,985
will work very well
side by side with you.

1209
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:21,734
You don't mean it.

1210
01:25:22,075 --> 01:25:23,075
Of course I do,

1211
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:25,150
I think their best
place on the force

1212
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:27,360
will be working
right along side you.

1213
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:29,700
Shut up back there!

1214
01:25:33,378 --> 01:25:36,541
I mean, sure, they'll
make great partners.

1215
01:26:27,265 --> 01:26:32,134
J huh

1216
01:26:34,272 --> 01:26:37,230
j got a pistol in my pocket

1217
01:26:37,567 --> 01:26:40,183

1218
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:42,065
j put your finger on the trigger

1219
01:26:42,406 --> 01:26:43,816
j feel it getting bigger

1220
01:26:44,157 --> 01:26:45,157
j move a little closer

1221
01:26:45,492 --> 01:26:46,594
j let me stick it
in your holster

1222
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:49,735
j let's do it

1223
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:52,571
j shoot my bullet

1224
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:55,783

01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:58,790

j it's got a 12 inch length

1227
01:27:01,007 --> 01:27:02,122
j and you can make it plank

1228
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:05,083

1229
01:27:05,429 --> 01:27:08,296

1230
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:11,382
j shoot my bullet

1231
01:27:11,727 --> 01:27:14,434
j when you roll up in my Levi's

1232
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:19,515

1233
01:27:24,406 --> 01:27:27,273

1234
01:27:27,617 --> 01:27:30,324
j and baby, you can cock it

1235
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:31,902

01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,786

1238
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:39,702
j let's do it

1239
01:27:40,046 --> 01:27:42,708

1240
01:27:43,049 --> 01:27:45,836

1242
01:28:36,102 --> 01:28:40,971

01:28:42,484 --> 01:28:45,317
