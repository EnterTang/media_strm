1
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:19,871
是的。

1
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:19,871
Yeah.

2
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,790
那么为什么不呢

2
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,790
So why don't

3
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:23,666
你去吧。

3
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:23,666
you go ahead.

4
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,217
并分享一首诗

4
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,217
And share a poem

5
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,511
我一直在努力？

5
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,511
I've been
working on?

6
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,303
我不想。

6
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,303
I don't want to.

7
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,305
但 Proven 说我必须这样做。

7
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,305
But Proven said
I had to.

8
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,432
所以我没有说你必须这样做。

8
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,432
So I didn't say
you had to.

9
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,769
它被称为这个地方是狗屎。

9
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,769
It's called
This Place is shit.

10
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,686
哦，很好。

10
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,686
Oh, good.

11
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,231
这个地方是狗屎。

11
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,231
This place is shit.

12
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,609
这个地方闻起来像狗屎。

12
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,609
This place
smells like shit.

13
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,487
贝茜的声音听起来像狗屎。

13
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,487
Bessie's voice
sounds like shit.

14
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,864
癌症狗屎。

14
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,864
Cancer shit.

15
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:55,281
奥斯卡

15
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:55,281
Oscar

16
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,241
那傻吗

16
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,241
does that stupid

17
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,200
他想走就走

17
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,200
walk when he wants

18
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,953
为了隐藏他的狗屎，他的裤子。

18
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,953
to hide his shit,
his pants.

19
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,871
弥尔顿有狗屎

19
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,871
And Milton has shit

20
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,915
音乐品味。

20
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,915
taste in music.

21
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,420
这还没完。

21
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,420
It's not finished.

22
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,214
那太好了。

22
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,214
That was great.

23
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:12,882
那太好了。

23
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:12,882
That was great.

24
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:13,299
让我们。

24
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:13,299
Let's.

25
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,634
我要为此鼓掌。

25
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,634
I'm going to clap
for that.

26
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,468
不要鼓掌。

26
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,468
Don't clap for.

27
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,470
我要为它鼓掌。

27
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,470
I'm going to clap
for it.

28
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:31,025
鼓掌。

28
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:31,025
Clap for.

29
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,448
你的玩得怎么样？

29
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,448
How's your play?

30
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,074
伟大。

30
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,074
Great.

31
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,784
感谢今天的分享。

31
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,784
Thanks for sharing
today.

32
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:42,078
很多亵渎，但我。

32
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:42,078
A lot of profanity,
but I.

33
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,497
我不欣赏这个评论

33
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,497
I didn't appreciate
the comment

34
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,165
关于奥斯卡的便便散步。

34
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,165
about Oscar's poop
walk.

35
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:47,625
奥斯卡觉得这很有趣。

35
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:47,625
Oscar thought
it was funny.

36
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,252
这很有趣，但它仍然很刻薄。

36
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,252
It was funny, but
it was still mean.

37
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,878
我是一个非常刻薄的人。

37
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,878
I'm a very mean
person.

38
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:52,755
这是一个非常开放的认识。

38
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:52,755
That's a very open
realization.

39
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,674
我早就知道了。

39
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,674
I've known that
for a while.

40
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,176
嘿，我们要展示半小时。

40
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,176
Hey, we're going to
show half an hour.

41
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,762
哦，看，到那时我可能已经死了。

41
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,762
Oh, see, I might be
dead by then.

42
00:02:59,887 --> 00:03:00,471
哦，是的，你可能会。

42
00:02:59,887 --> 00:03:00,471
Oh, yeah, you might.

43
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,140
但如果你没有死，它就很短。

43
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,140
But if you're not
dead, it's short.

44
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,600
而且它在城市里。

44
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,600
And it's in
the city.

45
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:05,601
你上一次是什么时候

45
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:05,601
When's the last
time you

46
00:03:05,601 --> 00:03:06,185
在城里吗？

46
00:03:05,601 --> 00:03:06,185
were in the city?

47
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:07,895
上次

47
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:07,895
Last time

48
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:10,898
应该是最后一次。

48
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:10,898
was supposed
to be the last time.

49
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,819
另一个时间在哪里？

49
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,819
Where's
another time?

50
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,740
如果我们吃披萨，我就去。

50
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,740
I'll go
if we get pizza.

51
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,324
我们昨天可以吃披萨吗？

51
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,324
Can we have pizza
yesterday?

52
00:03:20,324 --> 00:03:22,201
你吃了吗？不。

52
00:03:20,324 --> 00:03:22,201
Did you eat it? No.

53
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,619
那不是披萨。

53
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,619
That wasn't pizza.

54
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:24,078
好。

54
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:24,078
Okay.

55
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:24,579
嗯，那么，是的，

55
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:24,579
Well, then, yeah,

56
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,122
我们会在回来的路上吃披萨。

56
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,122
we'll get pizza
on the way back.

57
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,790
在城市里。

57
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,790
In the city.

58
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,418
在城市里。

58
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,418
In the city.

59
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,630
我去换衣服。

59
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,630
I'll go get changed.

60
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,923
好吧。

60
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,923
All right.

61
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,634
如果您需要帮助，请告诉凯蒂。

61
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,634
Let Katie know
if you need help.

62
00:03:38,634 --> 00:03:52,023
是的。

62
00:03:38,634 --> 00:03:52,023
Yeah.

63
00:03:52,648 --> 00:03:53,983
安静。

63
00:03:52,648 --> 00:03:53,983
Quiet.

64
00:03:54,108 --> 00:05:38,838
变得更好。

64
00:03:54,108 --> 00:05:38,838
Getting better.

65
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:40,715
好吧，伙计们。

65
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:40,715
All right, guys.

66
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,758
这有点陡峭

66
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,758
This is a little bit
steep

67
00:05:42,758 --> 00:05:44,176
抓住栏杆。

67
00:05:42,758 --> 00:05:44,176
to grab on
to the railing.

68
00:05:44,176 --> 00:05:48,973
你知道，从来都不是好事，也不是坏事。

68
00:05:44,176 --> 00:05:48,973
You know,
and never good, bad.

69
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,141
就像，首先

69
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,141
Like, first

70
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,642
父亲下去了，就像，上升了。

70
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,642
father goes down
and, like, goes up.

71
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,728
这是一场木偶戏。

71
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,728
It's a puppet show.

72
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:54,854
这是一场牵线木偶表演。

72
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:54,854
It's a marionette
show.

73
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,772
我们是牵线木偶。

73
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,772
We are marionette.

74
00:05:56,772 --> 00:05:57,732
你撒谎。

74
00:05:56,772 --> 00:05:57,732
You lie.

75
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,566
我不知道我是不是撒谎了。

75
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,566
I don't know
if I lie.

76
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,401
您可以查看时间表。

76
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,401
You can check
the schedule.

77
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,527
你绊倒了吗？

77
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,527
You tripped?

78
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:01,902
哦，是的。

78
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:01,902
Oh, yeah.

79
00:06:01,902 --> 00:06:03,779
我试着施加压力。

79
00:06:01,902 --> 00:06:03,779
I tried to pressure.

80
00:06:04,613 --> 00:06:06,323
一段引人入胜的历史。

80
00:06:04,613 --> 00:06:06,323
A fascinating
history.

81
00:06:06,323 --> 00:06:07,658
这些话，实际上是一个参考。

81
00:06:06,323 --> 00:06:07,658
The words, actually,
a reference.

82
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:08,909
致圣母玛利亚

82
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:08,909
To the Virgin Mary

83
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,629
就像。

83
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,629
was like.

84
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,132
这是佛罗多。

84
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,132
This is Frodo.

85
00:06:23,591 --> 00:08:20,416
我画画

85
00:06:23,591 --> 00:08:20,416
I draw

86
00:08:27,923 --> 00:08:45,316
没有游戏。

86
00:08:27,923 --> 00:08:45,316
no game.

87
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,943
就这个，就这个。

87
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,943
Just this,
just this.

88
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,739
我欠你多少钱？

88
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,739
How much do
I owe you?

89
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,908
嘿，多少钱？

89
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,908
Hey, how much?

90
00:08:54,908 --> 00:08:56,035
这是 4 美元。

90
00:08:54,908 --> 00:08:56,035
It's $4.

91
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,538
而且你不能在这里养猫。

91
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,538
And you can't have
a cat in here.

92
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,833
这是一只服务猫。

92
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,833
It's a service cat.

93
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:03,792
不，我认识你。

93
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:03,792
No, I know you.

94
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:04,376
我听到了你们所有人的声音。

94
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:04,376
I hear you all.

95
00:09:04,376 --> 00:09:05,169
全部聚集起来

95
00:09:04,376 --> 00:09:05,169
Gather all up

96
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,629
并尽快上车。

96
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,629
and get on the bus
as soon as I can.

97
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:08,088
你好？

97
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:08,088
Hello?

98
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:09,923
你好。

98
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:09,923
Hello.

99
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,261
哦，是的

99
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,261
Oh, yeah,

100
00:09:15,262 --> 00:09:15,763
是的。

100
00:09:15,262 --> 00:09:15,763
yeah.

101
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,640
就像您支付一样

101
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,640
Just as you paying

102
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,101
三。

102
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,101
three.

103
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,978
所以，听着，

103
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,978
So, listen,

104
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:25,814
我们现在必须回去。再见。

104
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:25,814
we have to head back
now. Bye.

105
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:26,982
有些事情正在发生

105
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:26,982
Something's
happening

106
00:09:26,982 --> 00:09:27,483
在城市里，

106
00:09:26,982 --> 00:09:27,483
in the city,

107
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,485
他们希望我们回来，杰森。

107
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,485
and they want us
back, Jason.

108
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,196
但我们先吃披萨。

108
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,196
But we're getting
pizza first.

109
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,238
不，我们得安排。

109
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,238
No, we're going
to have to arrange.

110
00:09:33,238 --> 00:09:34,406
一切都是为了让他们可以等待。

110
00:09:33,238 --> 00:09:34,406
Everything
so they can wait.

111
00:09:34,406 --> 00:09:35,908
这只是披萨。

111
00:09:34,406 --> 00:09:35,908
It's just pizza.

112
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:37,993
山 姆。改天我们再吃披萨。

112
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:37,993
Sam. We'll get pizza
another day.

113
00:09:37,993 --> 00:09:39,995
我们已经在城里了。

113
00:09:37,993 --> 00:09:39,995
We're already
in the city.

114
00:09:39,995 --> 00:09:41,246
好吧，那么今晚订购。

114
00:09:39,995 --> 00:09:41,246
Well, then order it
tonight.

115
00:09:41,246 --> 00:09:43,082
只需在城市里得到它。

115
00:09:41,246 --> 00:09:43,082
Just get it
in the city.

116
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:43,624
什么？

116
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:43,624
What?

117
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:44,958
我们在城里吃披萨

117
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:44,958
We're getting pizza
in the city

118
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:45,876
然后我们回去。

118
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:45,876
and then we'll go
back.

119
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:46,919
不，我们不会去。

119
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:46,919
No, we're not going.

120
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,253
是的。我们得到了。

120
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,253
Yes. We are getting.

121
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:49,588
你得冷静下来。冷静。

121
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:49,588
You got to calm
down. Calm down.

122
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:50,839
别告诉我。冷静。

122
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:50,839
Don't tell me.
Calm down.

123
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:52,049
我不和你争论。

123
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:52,049
I don't argue
with you.

124
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,884
我只是。我是你的朋友，好吗？

124
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,884
I'm just. I'm
your friend, okay?

125
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:54,927
你不是我的朋友。

125
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:54,927
You're not
my friend.

126
00:09:54,927 --> 00:10:02,434
你是一名护士。

126
00:09:54,927 --> 00:10:02,434
You're a nurse.

127
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:04,061
你上了车。

127
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:04,061
You get on the bus.

128
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:10,609
是的，上车。我是

128
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:10,609
Yeah,

131
00:12:50,477 --> 00:12:52,604
现在大家

00:12:50,477 --> 00:12:52,604
Now everyone

132
00:13:20,298 --> 00:13:22,342

00:20:24,347 --> 00:20:26,224
one point.

136
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:32,104
19115497.

136
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:32,104
19115497.

137
00:20:32,146 --> 00:20:37,318
哦，五。

137
00:20:32,146 --> 00:20:37,318
Oh five.

138
00:20:38,152 --> 00:20:41,781
撤离该区域，而不是

138
00:20:38,152 --> 00:20:41,781
Evacuate
the area, not

139
00:20:43,032 --> 00:20:44,200
疏散。

139
00:20:43,032 --> 00:20:44,200
evacuate.

140
00:20:46,535 --> 00:20:48,162
100小时。

140
00:20:46,535 --> 00:20:48,162
100 hours.

141
00:20:48,829 --> 00:20:52,500
当您遇到这种情况时，就会发生这种情况

141
00:20:48,829 --> 00:20:52,500
That happens
when you

142
00:22:29,388 --> 00:22:29,889
旅行

142
00:22:29,388 --> 00:22:29,889
travel

143
00:22:30,765 --> 00:22:33,642

one half.

146
00:25:53,967 --> 00:30:29,242
到一个

00:25:53,967 --> 00:30:29,242
To one

147
00:30:50,096 --> 00:30:50,430
路。

147
00:30:50,096 --> 00:30:50,430
road.

148
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:52,390
疏散工作已经开始。现在。

148
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:52,390
Evacuations
are beginning. Now.

149
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,309
南街海港

149
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,309
South Street Seaport

150
00:30:54,309 --> 00:31:01,232
向南行驶要格外小心。

150
00:30:54,309 --> 00:31:01,232
travel south with
extreme caution.

151
00:31:01,232 --> 00:31:01,983
这是一个。

151
00:31:01,232 --> 00:31:01,983
This is a.

152
00:31:01,983 --> 00:31:03,985
强制疏散令。

152
00:31:01,983 --> 00:31:03,985
Mandatory
evacuation order.

153
00:31:04,486 --> 00:31:05,528
我们仍然处于以下状态。

153
00:31:04,486 --> 00:31:05,528
We remain under.

154
00:31:05,528 --> 00:31:06,363
攻击。

154
00:31:05,528 --> 00:31:06,363
Attack.

155
00:31:06,946 --> 00:31:08,907
在水上寻求庇护。

155
00:31:06,946 --> 00:31:08,907
Seek shelter
on water.

156
00:31:08,907 --> 00:31:11,201
你的口袋不会游泳。

156
00:31:08,907 --> 00:31:11,201
Your pockets cannot
swim.

157
00:31:11,201 --> 00:31:12,369
两次疏散。

157
00:31:11,201 --> 00:31:12,369
Both evacuations.

158
00:31:12,369 --> 00:31:13,286
现在开始

00:36:24,555 --> 00:37:20,695
哦，伙计。

00:36:24,555 --> 00:37:20,695
Oh, man.

163
00:37:20,695 --> 00:38:45,070
乔纳森

163
00:37:20,695 --> 00:38:45,070
Jonathan,

to go south,

169
00:41:30,986 --> 00:41:43,874
看看他们的船。

see their boats.

170
00:41:43,874 --> 00:41:47,127
你需要停止一些

170
00:41:43,874 --> 00:41:47,127
You need to
stop some

171
00:41:56,303 --> 00:42:07,397

Okay.

Okay.

Let's just.

让我们摆脱伤害。

178
00:42:40,263 --> 00:42:47,562
Let's get out
of harm's way.

179
00:42:47,562 --> 00:43:18,343
留在某个地方。

179
00:42:47,562 --> 00:43:18,343
Keep someplace.

180
00:43:19,177 --> 00:43:22,681
是的。

180
00:43:19,177 --> 00:43:22,681
Yeah.

181
00:43:22,681 --> 00:43:23,765
您可以向此项目作出贡献

181
00:43:22,681 --> 00:43:23,765
You could help

182
00:43:26,935 --> 00:43:28,019
它。用一只脚出去。

182
00:43:26,935 --> 00:43:28,019
it. Out with a foot.

183
00:43:33,734 --> 00:43:42,075
浪。

183
00:43:33,734 --> 00:43:42,075
Wave.

184
00:43:42,075 --> 00:44:27,204
哦，等等

184
00:43:42,075 --> 00:44:27,204
Ooh, wait

185
00:44:27,704 --> 00:44:32,375
一分钟。

185
00:44:27,704 --> 00:44:32,375
a minute.

186
00:44:32,375 --> 00:44:32,918
哦，你看。

186
00:44:32,375 --> 00:44:32,918
Oh, you look.

187
00:44:32,918 --> 00:44:40,258
你感觉很糟糕。

187
00:44:32,918 --> 00:44:40,258
You feel bad.

188
00:44:40,258 --> 00:44:40,759
娜塔莉。

188
00:44:40,258 --> 00:44:40,759
Natalie.

189
00:44:40,759 --> 00:44:53,063
在这里，我触摸你可以去的地方。

189
00:44:40,759 --> 00:44:53,063
Here, I touch
where you can go.

190
00:44:53,063 --> 00:45:01,029
哦，没关系。

190
00:44:53,063 --> 00:45:01,029
Oh, it's all right.

191
00:45:01,112 --> 00:45:08,912
还有那个锚，我来了，

191
00:45:01,112 --> 00:45:08,912
And the anchor,
I came here,

192
00:45:09,287 --> 00:45:15,085
学校。

192
00:45:09,287 --> 00:45:15,085
the school.

193
00:45:15,085 --> 00:45:15,919
只是我做的一件事

193
00:45:15,085 --> 00:45:15,919
Just the one thing I

194
00:45:15,919 --> 00:45:20,840
本来应该做的。

194
00:45:15,919 --> 00:45:20,840
was supposed to do.

195
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,509
你得去水边。

195
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,509
You got to get to
the water.

196
00:45:22,509 --> 00:45:26,346
我离开了城市。

196
00:45:22,509 --> 00:45:26,346
I get out
of the city.

197
00:45:26,346 --> 00:45:27,555
你去哪儿？

197
00:45:26,346 --> 00:45:27,555
Where are you going?

198
00:45:27,555 --> 00:45:30,725
我要去吃披萨。

198
00:45:27,555 --> 00:45:30,725
I'm going to get
pizza.

199
00:45:30,725 --> 00:45:31,351
井。

199
00:45:30,725 --> 00:45:31,351
Well.

200
00:45:31,935 --> 00:45:38,358
贝茜在哈莱姆区。

200
00:45:31,935 --> 00:45:38,358
Basie's up
in Harlem.

201
00:45:38,358 --> 00:45:40,360
我认为世界。可能要结束了。

201
00:45:38,358 --> 00:45:40,360
I think the world.
Might be ending.

202
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:43,071
我认为这是一个糟糕的赛季设置。

202
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:43,071
I think this is bad
season setting up.

203
00:45:43,071 --> 00:45:45,699
这是最后 11 句话

203
00:45:43,071 --> 00:45:45,699
That is the last
11 says

204
00:45:45,699 --> 00:45:54,332
我会得到的。

204
00:45:45,699 --> 00:45:54,332
I'm going to get.

205
00:45:54,332 --> 00:45:54,749
好

205
00:45:54,332 --> 00:45:54,749
Okay,

206
00:45:55,834 --> 00:45:56,334
好

206
00:45:55,834 --> 00:45:56,334
okay,

207
00:45:57,252 --> 00:45:57,836
好。

207
00:45:57,252 --> 00:45:57,836
okay.

208
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,796
我们来吃披萨吧。

208
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,796
Let's get pizza.

209
00:45:59,796 --> 00:46:01,756
不，我要吃披萨。

209
00:45:59,796 --> 00:46:01,756
No, I'm
getting pizza.

210
00:46:01,756 --> 00:46:03,091
你运行了这个吗？

210
00:46:01,756 --> 00:46:03,091
Did you run this?

211
00:46:03,091 --> 00:46:08,346
是的，但现在不是了。

211
00:46:03,091 --> 00:46:08,346
Yeah,
but not anymore.

212
00:46:09,347 --> 00:46:12,350
事实并非如此。

212
00:46:09,347 --> 00:46:12,350
It's not.

213
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:14,728
那是我爸爸。

213
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:14,728
That's my dad.

214
00:46:15,895 --> 00:46:17,230
我的钢琴。

214
00:46:15,895 --> 00:46:17,230
My piano.

215
00:46:17,564 --> 00:46:18,398
你玩

215
00:46:17,564 --> 00:46:18,398
You play

216
00:46:24,904 --> 00:46:43,715
尽可能。

216
00:46:24,904 --> 00:46:43,715
as possible.

217
00:46:43,715 --> 00:46:44,716
拜托，我可以来拿吗

217
00:46:43,715 --> 00:46:44,716
Please,
can I come and get

218
00:46:44,716 --> 00:47:04,652
和你一起吃披萨？

218
00:46:44,716 --> 00:47:04,652
pizza with you?

219
00:47:04,652 --> 00:47:05,653

Right. This

220
00:47:15,163 --> 00:47:15,955
他说想要。

220
00:47:15,163 --> 00:47:15,955
he said wanted.

221
00:47:15,955 --> 00:47:17,749
要使用

221
00:47:15,955 --> 00:47:17,749
To use

222
00:47:18,541 --> 00:47:21,586
它。已经两年了。

222
00:47:18,541 --> 00:47:21,586
it. It's been two.

223
00:47:21,586 --> 00:47:24,631
你说 4 到 6 个月。

223
00:47:21,586 --> 00:47:24,631
You said
4 to 6 months.

224
00:47:24,631 --> 00:47:26,549
已经六年了。

224
00:47:24,631 --> 00:47:26,549
It has been six.

225
00:47:26,716 --> 00:47:28,676
这对我来说是免费的。

225
00:47:26,716 --> 00:47:28,676
And this is free
to me.

226
00:47:28,676 --> 00:47:32,764
减去我。

226
00:47:28,676 --> 00:47:32,764
Subtraction me.

227
00:47:33,473 --> 00:47:35,975
加法。

227
00:47:33,473 --> 00:47:35,975
Addition.

228
00:47:35,975 --> 00:47:38,520
我被告知这个简单的数学。

228
00:47:35,975 --> 00:47:38,520
And I was told
this simple math.

229
00:47:39,729 --> 00:47:41,731
在我的生活中

229
00:47:39,729 --> 00:47:41,731
In my life

230
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:46,861
我从来没有。

230
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:46,861
and I never.

231
00:47:46,861 --> 00:47:49,280
需要更多，更多

231
00:47:46,861 --> 00:47:49,280
Needed more, a more

232
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,323
或更少

232
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,323
or less

233
00:47:51,533 --> 00:47:54,827
下降到三个

233
00:47:51,533 --> 00:47:54,827
to fall to three

234
00:47:54,827 --> 00:47:56,120
到小。

234
00:47:54,827 --> 00:47:56,120
to small.

235
00:47:56,746 --> 00:47:58,373
而且小。井

235
00:47:56,746 --> 00:47:58,373
And small. Well

236
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,586
直到一个月。

236
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,586
until month.

237
00:48:04,629 --> 00:48:05,922
今天的

237
00:48:04,629 --> 00:48:05,922
Today's

238
00:48:07,715 --> 00:48:09,342
它是

238
00:48:07,715 --> 00:48:09,342
it was

239
00:48:13,721 --> 00:48:20,853

00:48:20,853 --> 00:53:24,907
但不是现在。

240
00:48:20,853 --> 00:53:24,907
but not now.

241
00:53:24,907 --> 00:57:34,656
我的小学校

241
00:53:24,907 --> 00:57:34,656
My little school

242
01:00:12,647 --> 01:00:14,149
我有

242
01:00:12,647 --> 01:00:14,149
I had

243
01:00:16,318 --> 01:00:18,612
在那个时候对他来说是什么。

243
01:00:16,318 --> 01:00:18,612
what to him
at that point.

244
01:00:18,612 --> 01:00:21,781
我想如果我没有。

244
01:00:18,612 --> 01:00:21,781
And I think
if I didn't.

245
01:00:22,449 --> 01:00:23,950
获取材料。

245
01:00:22,449 --> 01:00:23,950
Get the materials.

246
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:25,994
像这些合同

246
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:25,994
Like these contract

247
01:00:27,329 --> 01:00:34,002

248
01:00:34,002 --> 01:08:08,581
我只是

I just

249
01:09:19,819 --> 01:09:40,923
我爱

249
01:09:19,819 --> 01:09:40,923
I loved

250
01:09:44,677 --> 01:09:46,929
当我看到他打球时

250
01:09:44,677 --> 01:09:46,929
when it took me
to see him playing

251
01:09:48,472 --> 01:09:50,891
在爵士乐俱乐部

251
01:09:48,472 --> 01:09:50,891
at a jazz club

252
01:09:51,225 --> 01:09:53,060

died.

256
01:10:41,358 --> 01:10:52,995
哦，这很难

256
01:10:41,358 --> 01:10:52,995
Oh it's hard

257
01:13:26,523 --> 01:13:30,152
要有婴儿钢琴

257
01:13:26,523 --> 01:13:30,152
to have baby piano

258
01:19:22,587 --> 01:23:54,984
我们是。

258
01:19:22,587 --> 01:23:54,984
we were.

259
01:24:08,539 --> 01:24:09,915
停下船。

259
01:24:08,539 --> 01:24:09,915
Stop the boat.

260
01:24:09,957 --> 01:24:10,750
停下船

260
01:24:09,957 --> 01:24:10,750
Stop the boat

261
01:24:34,565 --> 01:39:18,406
你了解你。

261
01:24:34,565 --> 01:39:18,406
you know you.
