为什么你们气氛这么紧张

00:08:19,568 --> 00:08:20,951
还有确定一下撤退计划
and the brigade plus the hospital retreat plans.

69
00:08:21,191 --> 00:08:22,775
所以对面有多少德国人  同志

73
00:08:32,121 --> 00:08:34,191
就一辆没有后援的坦克吗
A tank without infantry support?

74
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:37,101
还有几个步兵也和我们一起
Support. We'll scrape together a few infantry men.

75
00:08:40,231 --> 00:08:42,231
我们就像傻逼一样
We... we are fools.

76
00:08:42,711 --> 00:08:44,181
帕夫洛把你手枪给我  我干脆自杀算了
Pavlo, give me your revolver, I'll shoot myself now.

77
00:08:44,201 --> 00:08:45,181
闭嘴
Shut up.

78
00:08:48,181 --> 00:08:50,551
中尉同志我们已经一周没睡了
Lieutenant, we have been fighting for a week we have had no sleep,

79
00:08:50,552 --> 00:08:52,151
我们还能站着已经是个奇迹了
it is a wonder we are still standing up.

80
00:08:53,021 --> 00:08:54,514
我们是这个营仅剩的了
We're all that is left of a battalion.

81
00:08:54,515 --> 00:08:56,191
接下来要我们去哪  屠宰场吗

82
00:08:56,691 --> 00:08:57,844
指挥官  这里就是前线
Commander, this is the front.

83
00:08:57,845 --> 00:08:59,166
你这辈子到过前线吗
Have you ever even been to the front?

84
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:00,461
在前线上你能告诉我们什么

好的  你们已经表达过你们的担忧了

或许我还没真正到过前线  但是我可以告诉你们
Maybe I haven't actually seen a front yet, but I can tell you all

88
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,244
在指挥官培训中
that in Commander Training

我受到了最高级别的嘉奖
I received the highest graduating honors.

90
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:19,166
来这边
Now this way.

91
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,347
你们这群傻子怎么
Why not simply arrange an early vacation

92
00:09:25,348 --> 00:09:26,875
不在进坦克前放个假
by leaving a dummy in the tank?

93
00:09:26,911 --> 00:09:28,081
然后颤栗着躲在避难所里
and go on to cowardly live in an ayslum?

94
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:30,502
你们认为火炮
What is the range of your cannon?

95
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,381
射击范围只有1.5千米
You think it is one and a half kilometers.

96
00:09:31,511 --> 00:09:34,911
我们必须至少打2公里远
We must get at least two kilometers.

97
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,141
埃卢斯塔尔克同志
Comrade Ellustultak?

98
00:09:37,031 --> 00:09:38,191
你们用的什么类型的弹药
What kind of ammunition are you using?

99
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:46,281
你甚至不知道这种最基本的事情
You don't even know this basic fact.

100
00:09:50,911 --> 00:09:53,281
-同志你姓什么  -瓦西里翁
-Comrade, your family name? -Vasilions.

101
00:09:54,491 --> 00:09:56,281
引擎是热的  瓦西里翁  这点你做的很好
The engine was warmed up, Vasilions, that's good.

102
00:09:57,081 --> 00:09:59,191
但是为什么排气管漏油
And why is oil leaking into the smokey exhaust?

103
00:10:00,181 --> 00:10:02,211
-把漏油修好  -明白
-Stop the leak. -I understand.

104
00:10:04,861 --> 00:10:05,861
我们有一个任务
We now have a mission.

105
00:10:07,821 --> 00:10:09,814
而且我警告你们  在这个团队里
and I warn you, any whining in this crew

106
00:10:09,815 --> 00:10:11,381
任何抱怨都会被视作怯战
I will consider it as cowardice.

107
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:16,221
我可以根据军事法依法惩处

108
00:10:17,631 --> 00:10:18,931
你们听明白了吗
It that understood?

109
00:10:22,651 --> 00:10:24,051
在莫斯科敌军已近兵临城下了
The enemy at the walls of Moscow.

110
00:10:25,211 --> 00:10:27,471
你们不能抱怨而且别再扭扭捏捏了
You don't whine here, and don't be ashamed.

111
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:31,011
只要我们凝聚起来  每个乘员各司其职
Even a single tank is a great force,

112
00:10:31,501 --> 00:10:33,971
即便只有一辆坦克也是一股强大的力量
if the crew is cohesive and each tank member knows his job.

113
00:10:35,991 --> 00:10:39,161
中尉  你与古布利贾见面的时间到了
Lieutenant, Your meeting with Gobulija's is approaching.

114

抛弃一切多余负重

121

122
00:10:59,411 --> 00:11:01,491
-你弹得好吗  -通常来说挺好的

127
00:11:19,171 --> 00:11:21,231
然后我们在这接应他们撤退

128
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:25,431
德国鬼子过来的路  路境非常糟糕
The road turns, coming from the Gerry's side.

129
00:11:26,691 --> 00:11:28,761
你是个优秀的战术家  古布利贾同志

130
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:30,281
只是经验丰富罢了
It's just experience.

131
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:40,491

我们能解决好  指挥官同志
We'll deal with it, Comrade Commander.

133
00:11:44,201 --> 00:11:45,201

134
00:11:49,151 --> 00:11:52,081
亲爱的母亲  请不要担心  我很好

俄国人总是能绝地反击
The Russians can make always something out of nothing.

139

你不可能习惯这个鬼地方的
It is impossible to get used to.

146
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:06,581
我的胡子能保温
The beard can warm the face.

147
00:13:07,866 --> 00:13:10,416
你怎么不留胡子 你看起来像是伊万

148
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,250
{\pos(190,60)}伊万是一位有着浓密胡须的俄国沙皇

从现在开始我持续刮胡子一个星期  一个星期后我们就占领莫斯科了
I'll shave one week from now, when we occupy Moscow.

By  this clock I say we will be the first Germans into Red Square.

151

我们德国人是你们的主人

305
00:36:47,511 --> 00:36:49,911
我们德国人决定你们的生死
We Germans decide whether you live or die.

306
00:36:53,381 --> 00:36:54,381
立正

307
00:36:55,851 --> 00:36:56,851
趴下
Fall to the ground.

308
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:27,221
看着我  你是俄罗斯人吗
Look at me. Are you Russian?

309
00:37:29,271 --> 00:37:32,871
长官  他是俄军坦克手

00:37:36,151 --> 00:37:38,021
姓名和军衔不详  他已经逃跑7次了

311

问你呢  你的名字和军衔

317
00:39:12,831 --> 00:39:13,831
说出你的名字和军衔

318
00:39:21,531 --> 00:39:23,301
别弄死他了  他会开口的

319
00:39:45,171 --> 00:39:46,171
他们到了
They're here.

320
00:39:55,771 --> 00:39:58,731
各位  这是里希夫乌勒先生

321
00:40:03,061 --> 00:40:04,416
古德里安上将给我看了

322
00:40:04,417 --> 00:40:06,211
你的报告  贾格尔上校

323
00:40:08,081 --> 00:40:09,351
你说的很及时
This is a timely thought.

324
00:40:10,811 --> 00:40:14,271
里希夫乌勒  不久俄军坦克将会穿过我们的边界
Reichsführer, soon Russian tanks will cross our border.

325
00:40:15,151 --> 00:40:18,221
要是我们不采取紧急行动  帝国就要遭罪了
If we don't take urgent action, the Reich could suffer.

326
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,748
我想创建一个新的坦克作战编队
I want to create a new tank fighting corps

327
00:40:20,749 --> 00:40:23,371
一代足以粉碎红军的超级战士

328
00:40:25,001 --> 00:40:27,911
你恨俄罗斯吗  贾格尔
You hate the Russians, Jäger?

329
00:40:31,941 --> 00:40:34,661
我是一名士兵  士兵没有感情
I'm a soldier. Soldiers don't have emotions.

330
00:40:37,081 --> 00:40:38,211
我的责任是服务我的国家
My duty is to serve my country.

331
00:40:42,991 --> 00:40:44,531
总督察
Chief Inspector,

332
00:40:45,941 --> 00:40:49,691
我任命贾格尔上校为 希特勒专属党卫队装甲班
I appoint Jäger standartenführer Hitlerjugend SS Armor Class

333
00:40:49,991 --> 00:40:52,261
新坦克学员营的指挥官

334
00:40:54,861 --> 00:40:56,191
明白  里希夫乌勒先生

335
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:06,241
德国的安危就掌握在你手里了  上校

336
00:41:08,541 --> 00:41:10,708
希特勒万岁

337
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:17,166

338

一个有27个俄罗斯士兵  上校

339
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:57,375
-有什么问题 吗 -没有  长官

340
00:41:57,821 --> 00:41:59,351
说明一下
Let me explain.

341
00:42:00,731 --> 00:42:03,629
为了避免报复  有时被俘军官不会说出军衔
To avoid retaliation, sometimes captive officers do not admit rank

342
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:06,221
或是装成普通士兵以保持低调
or they surrendered to regular soldiers to keep a low profile.

343
00:42:06,781 --> 00:42:08,271
好吧  但无论是谁用这种方式隐藏身份
All right. But whoever conceals himself this way

344
00:42:08,272 --> 00:42:09,251
一定有一个活下去的充分理由

345
00:42:09,651 --> 00:42:12,121
我需要一个有求生欲的俄罗斯坦克指挥官

坦克指挥官

00:42:38,131 --> 00:42:39,031
这是谁
Who is this?

348
00:42:41,541 --> 00:42:44,241
恐怕这不是你要的  上校
I'm afraid this is just the reverse case, Standartenführer.

349
00:42:44,741 --> 00:42:46,191
他被叫做伊万  有着某些不寻常的求死欲望

350
00:42:46,291 --> 00:42:47,808
从1941年就被监禁了

351
00:42:47,809 --> 00:42:50,271
但他一直没有透露过姓名和军衔

352
00:42:51,371 --> 00:42:52,371
此外  他逃跑过7次

353
00:42:53,711 --> 00:42:55,381
还被判处了死刑

354
00:42:59,941 --> 00:43:01,981
贾格尔  怎么了

00:43:04,311 --> 00:43:06,251
我们找到需要的人了
We found the man we need.

356
00:43:08,621 --> 00:43:11,761
副巡官  我想进行一个秘密任务

357
00:43:11,781 --> 00:43:13,781
我需要一个经过训练的俄语翻译

358
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:17,651
一个集中营能让出来的人
Someone from the camp, whom they can afford to spare.

359
00:43:19,031 --> 00:43:20,031
马上
Immediately!

360
00:43:39,011 --> 00:43:40,241
我们还没正式见过  士兵
We have never formally met, soldier.

361
00:43:47,331 --> 00:43:49,831
不过你还记得1941年11月27日的坦克战  对吧
But do you remember the tank fight on November 27, 1941?

362
00:43:53,551 --> 00:43:54,551
邻近莫斯科的涅菲尔多小村
The Nyefjodov village near Moscow?

363
00:44:19,301 --> 00:44:20,831
你消灭了那一百个俄罗斯人吗
Did you liquidate your hundred Russians?

364
00:44:28,011 --> 00:44:29,411
我至少射中了你
Well, I shot you.

365
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,131
你看起来不错
You look good.

366
00:44:43,281 --> 00:44:44,281
无可救药
Incorrigible.

367
00:44:46,231 --> 00:44:48,031
不适合集中营工作的人
Not suitable for any work at the camp.

368
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,591
都会被清除掉
Prisoner must be liquidated.

369
00:45:10,621 --> 00:45:11,951
但我会给你另一个活下来的机会

370
00:45:15,251 --> 00:45:18,191
你可以组建一只俄罗斯坦克部队

371
00:45:24,441 --> 00:45:27,441
在规定的某天  要在训练场和射击场上

372
00:45:27,571 --> 00:45:31,261
向我的军官学员展示你杰出的坦克战斗技巧
you will show your exceptional tank fighting skills to my cadets.

373
00:45:32,441 --> 00:45:33,941
你不会有实弹  而是用哑弹来标记命中率
You won't have live ammunition but duds instead to mark the hits

374
00:45:36,151 --> 00:45:38,857
你要使用你的坦克部署技能

375
00:45:38,858 --> 00:45:41,151
来布置并分配我的部下
to subvert and out manuveur the cadets.

376
00:45:44,621 --> 00:45:45,749
如果你死在场上
If you are killed on the range ...

377
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,551
那么你就死得像战场上的士兵

378
00:45:51,781 --> 00:45:53,211
如果你赢了  你可能会活下来

379
00:45:55,131 --> 00:45:57,131
你必须组建一只新的小队

但是我已经毁了一组队员了

00:46:01,051 --> 00:46:03,051

我在等待你的答复

00:46:34,251 --> 00:46:35,251

这条路似乎已经被堵死了

正如我所担心的
As I feared he would

01:34:25,371 --> 01:34:28,061
他们在捷克摩拉维亚保护国  要去边境
in the Czech-Moravian Protectorate they're going to the border.

780
01:34:29,191 --> 01:34:30,871
我们把他们从主干道驱离
We diverted them from the main road

781
01:34:31,911 --> 01:34:34,271
所以现在我们可以把范围缩小到小路上

贾格尔  如果到早上那辆坦克还没被解决的话
Jäger, if this is not solved by the morning

790
01:35:04,781 --> 01:35:07,541
那我就不能再袒护你了

01:36:59,691 --> 01:37:01,821
我再重复一遍  我们必须马上回去

804
01:37:37,651 --> 01:37:41,541
无意冒犯  我以为我们要去柏林
Just a word, I thought we were going to Berlin.

805
01:37:41,541 --> 01:37:44,401
但柏林在反方向
Berlin is the opposite way.

806
01:37:49,861 --> 01:37:53,621
沿着路的左边尽可能地低飞
Fly as low as possible left on the road.

807

我们晚上在树林里走不远

血溅成一条小河

01:42:13,601 --> 01:42:17,601
像一条小河

流入多瑙河
flows into the Danube.

847
01:42:27,461 --> 01:42:32,501
那是他母亲汲水的地方
where his mother draws water

848
01:42:34,101 --> 01:42:39,201
也是他母亲思念儿子的地方
and where she remembers her son.

母亲  母亲  远离战争的

在斯拉夫科夫斯基之前  有一片50公里长的森林

我想我们已经完成我们的任务了

857
01:43:23,031 --> 01:43:25,661
长官  我们现在应该把坦克沉到这个湖里
Commander, we should now sink the tank in this lake,

858
01:43:25,661 --> 01:43:28,531
休息  然后分头行动

859
01:43:29,281 --> 01:43:30,351
我们救了自己

860
01:43:36,391 --> 01:43:39,111
米克拉  我不是因为你的命令才跟随你的
Mikola, it's not because of your orders that I'm with you,

861
01:43:39,112 --> 01:43:39,951
我是自愿的

862
01:43:41,491 --> 01:43:42,491
-我能说点什么吗  -当然

我会为坦克感到遗憾的

864
01:43:48,271 --> 01:43:51,341
长官  我不会离开你的身边
Commander, without you I'm not going anywhere.

865
01:43:54,581 --> 01:43:56,111
我们是红军士兵

867
01:43:58,240 --> 01:44:00,871
誓死摧毁敌人

868
01:44:02,131 --> 01:44:03,231
但是放弃一匹良驹实在可惜
But abandoning a perfectly good horse is a shame.

869
01:44:03,261 --> 01:44:04,161
伏尔索克

870
01:44:05,661 --> 01:44:08,801
你的实力和听力都像鹰一样敏锐
Not only your vision, but your hearing is like an eagle.

871
01:44:09,321 --> 01:44:10,851
你应该去马戏团
You should be in the circus.

872
01:44:10,871 --> 01:44:13,571
如果没有我你会迷失在河上的  驾驶员
Without me you'd wander lost enflessly on the river tank driver.

873
01:44:15,041 --> 01:44:16,041
所以现在休息一下
So give it a rest now.

874
01:44:30,001 --> 01:44:31,001

All right.

875

我们最后50公里继续使用坦克

大家轮流守夜  我们4点离开

天亮的时候道路会被封锁起来

889

我们趁还黑着突围出去

890
01:47:48,071 --> 01:47:49,071
安佳
Anja.

891
01:47:50,671 --> 01:47:52,571
你不能和我们一起上坦克

01:47:52,571 --> 01:47:55,081
我不会独自留在这的  我不会离开你
I won't stay here without you. I'm not going anywhere without you.

893
01:47:55,731 --> 01:47:56,731
安佳  听我说
Anja, listen to me.

894
01:47:58,031 --> 01:48:00,611
只要计划得当我们都能离开这里

01:48:09,081 --> 01:48:11,241
这条小路经过克林根塔尔镇

899
01:48:11,781 --> 01:48:13,651
你要去村子的左边

900
01:48:14,081 --> 01:48:16,541

01:49:47,401 --> 01:49:49,731
前面情况有古怪
There's an odd suitcase ahead in a stroller.

没想到这一招这么管用

移速20千米每小时的坦克每秒移动5.5米
A Tank moving 20 km/h is 5.5 meters per second. ....

945
01:54:11,345 --> 01:54:13,171
我们需要一个诱饵

946

德国佬每1.5秒能射击一次

还有谁这么勇敢  除我之外
