1
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,870
You know, some things are allowed -and others aren't allowed.

2
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,750
So, with you, did somebody -do something that was wrong?

3
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,870
It was my daddy.

4
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,040
Okay.

5
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,000
What did your daddy do?

6
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,960
He scratched my bottom.

7
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,420
Okay, tell me...

8
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,540
When he scratches your bottom, -where are you?

9
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,340
In my bedroom.

10
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,840
In your bedroom?

11
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,800
Do you have your own room?

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,710
Yes.

13
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,670
What's your room like?

14
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,090
Pink and white.

15
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,170
Like that.

16
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,630
Pretty, isn't it?

17
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,210
I love pink.

18
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,380
Ask her, was it at night?

19
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,510
Over or under her pajamas?

20
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,260
Dolores...

21
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,630
I need you to help me understand.

22
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,220
<i>- Will you help me? - Yes.</i>

23
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,590
What does Daddy do in your bedroom?

24
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,760
- Scratches my bottom! - Okay.

25
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,680
Where's your bottom?

26
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,680
Under my leggings-

27
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,090
I don't understand.

28
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,760
Why did Daddy do that?

29
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,390
Because he wanted to.

30
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,550
Does Daddy scratch -over or under your leggings?

31
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,640
Under my pajamas.

32
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,760
Does he take off your pajamas?

33
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:19,640
No.

34
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,970
And are you awake?

35
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,390
No.

36
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,010
No, you're asleep?

37
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,970
So you don't remember?

38
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,220
If Daddy did it, you have to tell us.

39
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,350
But if he didn't, -don't go telling tales.

40
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,470
See?

41
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,230
Dolores...

42
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,770
You remember Daddy -scratching your bottom?

43
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,390
- What did you say? - Nothing.

44
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,770
- Don't lie to Daddy. - We're not lying.

45
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,690
- Tell the truth. - It is the truth.

46
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,190
Don't cover up for Mommy.

47
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,310
- Do you love Daddy? - Yes.

48
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,150
- Swear! - We swear.

49
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,230
- You crossed hands. - We swear.

50
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,560
Hands like that.

51
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,520
On the table.

52
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,650
What about our toes?

53
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,230
Don't cross your toes.

54
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,270
You're crossing your feet, aren't you?

55
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,860
Swear you won't lie.

56
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,070
We swear We won't lie.

57
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,230
- Always tell the truth. - We'll always tell the truth.

58
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,940
<i>This is the time to laugh and to sing</i>

59
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,030
On children's island, every day is spring

60
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,700
It's the gleeful land of happy children

61
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,530
And lovely monsters Yes, it's paradise

62
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,200
<i>This garden is not so far</i>

63
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,860
It just takes a little imagination

64
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:58,700
<i>So here or there, Wherever you are</i>

65
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,740
<i>Flowers, songs and laughter will grow</i>

66
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:06,030
<i>This is the time to laugh and to sing...</i>

67
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,240
If only

68
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,080
<i>your parents</i>

69
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:24,870
Wanted to five on our island

70
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,660
<i>Everything would be</i>

71
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,450
<i>so much happier</i>

72
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,580
<i>And everybody's lives so much easier</i>

73
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,830
<i>This is the time to laugh and to sing...</i>

74
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,250
And lovely monsters

75
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,330
Yes, it's paradise

76
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,120
I'm asking you -if you had a hard-on or not, sir.

77
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,040
- No, I didn't. - It's simple.

78
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,210
No hard-on?

79
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,750
So what's all this about a Wiener?

80
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,540
She can say what she wants.

81
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,380
Was it poking out? Out of your...

82
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,080
Maybe she watches too many TV movies.

83
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:06,920
I see.

84
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,340
Where on TV would she get -such a precise description?

85
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,170
You have kids?

86
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,250
Sir, you have been indicted

87
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,250
on charges of -rape of a minor by a family member.

88
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,420
So if there's a time

89
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,090
to tell the full story -so she can rebuild her life,

90
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,130
it's now.

91
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,840
20 years in jail, you may not see -your granddaughter again.

92
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,260
So, you gave her a hug...

93
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,630
I already told you. -I gave her a hug as usual.

94
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,010
Like any grandfather.

95
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,090
And then, I've no idea why,

96
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,880
my hand kind of slipped and I...

97
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,430
And all of a sudden...

98
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,130
I stroked her kitty-cat

99
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,180
and I gave it a kiss but nothing else.

100
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,840
Your granddad says -he just kissed your kitty-cat.

101
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,470
Did he do anything else?

102
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,430
I didn't rub up against her.

103
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,680
- Yes, you did! - That's not true!

104
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,010
Why talk about rubbing, -when she hasn't mentioned it?

105
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,680
She said it this morning.

106
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:07,640
Sorry, I don't know who told you that, -but you've no idea

107
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,890
what she told us or not.

108
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,430
Did you rub on her?

109
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,640
No. If I have to say I did -to protect her, I will.

110
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,720
- If you want. - To protect her?

111
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,430
The best way to protect her -is to tell the truth.

112
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,560
You always believe the kids?

113
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,180
- Not always. - No, sir.

114
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,770
So what happened?

115
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,600
I undressed -and caressed her, and y'know.

116
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,850
"Y'know"? -Y'know doesn't exist

117
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,770
For a judge, it means nothing.

118
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,940
Marie, don't tell fibs. -Tell the truth now.

119
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,770
"Tell the truth"?

120
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,810
Soon you'll be saying she led you on.

121
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,140
I didn't say that.

122
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,560
Not quite.

123
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,560
You realize you helped guys -rape your friend?

124
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:47,980
Aren't you ashamed?

125
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,230
You realize?

126
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,690
You see it's serious?

127
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,480
Shut your face. -Quit sucking my pussy off!

128
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,150
Sucking your pussy off?

129
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,020
You're 14. Oooh, scary!

130
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,400
You're 1m5O tall. Oooh, scary!

131
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,770
You sellout!

132
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,980
Sellout?

133
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,480
Skank bitch.

134
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,610
I ask your opinion? -Take a chill pill!

135
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,770
Take a chill pill? -What's that mean?

136
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,070
You big up 'cos it says police. -Come by where I live.

137
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,650
And where d'you live?

138
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,980
- I'm from Rébeval. - Rébeval?

139
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,280
That's teddy bear country.

140
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,570
Your skank ass'll get it.

141
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,900
Okay. I work 9-7 every day.

142
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,320
On the Qur'an, I'll come fuck you up!

143
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,690
Know what? Shut up now!

144
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,110
<i>Or we'll keep you 2 days in the cells.</i>

145
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,450
Got that? -That mouth of yours! Can it!

146
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,360
I want a lawyer. I have rights.

147
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,610
You watch too much TV. -"I want a lawyer!"

148
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,950
He'll come down, see everything's okay -and take off.

149
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:44,570
With what we've got on you, -just shut your mouth!

150
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,990
We've got videos -of you taking your friend down there.

151
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,490
Into the garage -where your 3 buddies raped her.

152
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,280
And you mouth off at us?

153
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,530
This is the police here. -Just shut the fuck up!

154
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,700
A mouth 10 feet wide, that's all!

155
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,370
Hi there.

156
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,490
Daddy!

157
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,580
How's my little girl?

158
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,200
- Good. - Good good good?

159
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,080
Yes!

160
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,240
Happy to see your old dad or not?

161
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,120
You just breeze in -like this is a hotel?

162
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,700
Hello.

163
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,830
Can We talk calmly?

164
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,960
Yeah, right.

165
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:31,210
You say he cheated on me. -Sure, but I cheated on him.

166
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,670
It's totally different. -You fell for somebody else.

167
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,120
He listened to his cock.

168
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:39,420
That doesn't alter the fact -we're tied, 1-1.

169
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,170
- Sure, it does. - How come?

170
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,210
Because! -He was just following his cock...

171
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,040
And you...

172
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,880
You were following your heart.

173
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,500
That's the point.

174
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:54,040
Cheating with your head -not your cock is worse.

175
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,500
No, I don't agree. -How can I put it?

176
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,130
A cock's nothing, you see?

177
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,880
- A cock's nothing? Depends whose! - You know what I mean.

178
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,460
Don't let it dominate...

179
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,920
Having feelings isn't a crime.

180
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,420
Feelings are noble. -A cock's just icky!

181
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,050
- Maybe... - It's icky.

182
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,260
Just dipping your wick? I'm gone.

183
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,340
Think with your cock? Stop.

184
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,380
Think with your heart? Stay?

185
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,510
Your kid'll prefer -seeing her mom and dad

186
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,680
happy but separated, rather than -together, fighting like cat and dog.

187
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,590
Believe me.

188
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,470
You know how crazy we are. -Even apart, We won't take it easy.

189
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,300
Forget it then.

190
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,970
Forget it, it's over.

191
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,890
Seriously, do you love her?

192
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,470
- Of course he does. - Absolutely.

193
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,260
So be honest, -say you need time to think,

194
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,260
just a few days.

195
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,390
You can stay at mine if you want.

196
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,140
Céline loves you.

197
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,220
I love you guys, -but you're always copulating.

198
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,140
Tell me about your Iovelife, -not my hubby.

199
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,640
I quit. -I'm sick of getting laid.

200
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,350
Until I find the one, -total abstinence.

201
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:11,600
Brilliant!

202
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,180
What's funny?

203
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,680
I want a relationship. -Romance, love, all that.

204
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,350
Not getting my rocks off.

205
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,270
How do you explain Rachida?

206
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,060
Not Rachida!

207
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,140
What?

208
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,730
Arabs voted for Sarkozy, too. -Or he wouldn't have won.

209
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:29,440
Not me, no way. -So he could send me "back"? Look at me!

210
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,190
He was still elected president.

211
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,190
Which proves? -What does it prove?

212
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,770
It doesn't give him every right.

213
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,480
He was Treasury Secretary, -Interior Minister...

214
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,810
Look at his legal reforms. A mess!

215
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:43,560
He's always the first to step up -to defend the police.

216
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,190
But we've never had such a bad rap.

217
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,270
People think we don't protect them, -that we're no use.

218
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,730
- As always. - Not as always.

219
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,150
Except, before, we were their lackeys.

220
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,980
- Bamako... - We couldn't speak out!

221
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,400
Let me get a word in!

222
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,070
You'll have your say -when you're an officer.

223
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,480
That's pathetic.

224
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,690
Like it or lump it.

225
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,820
Have you any idea...

226
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,150
Have you any idea -how ridiculous that is? No offense.

227
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,320
I've no desire to offend you, -but pulling rank

228
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:15,440
when I'm merely expressing an opinion...

229
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,490
Know what? You're a good talker.

230
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:21,360
You've got the gift of the gab, -the right words,

231
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,570
but your arguments just suck.

232
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,950
You're the one -with the killer argument...

233
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:30,570
This is what happens -when it's not about sex. He's bored.

234
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,410
You're ostracizing me just...

235
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,740
Don't understand!

236
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,660
He doesn't understand "ostracize."

237
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,570
You're isolating me.

238
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,990
Say "sideline" not "ostracize"!

239
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,160
I'm his translator.

240
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,160
I'm sorry, -you all have your own identity,

241
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:48,450
you're all different, -you respect each other's identity.

242
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:53,040
I don't see why the way I talk -stops you respecting me.

243
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,450
- Talk normal! - Talk normally?

244
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,450
Yo, blow me right here. C'mon, man!

245
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,120
We gonna get us laid!

246
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,120
Check out that clit shit!

247
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,200
Fine, but it gets on my nerves.

248
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,700
Hold on, I haven't finished.

249
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,410
Know what? -Peas first, booze after.

250
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,450
I hate that. Cut it out.

251
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,660
- Slow down then. - I hate it.

252
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,120
I'm a big girl now.

253
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,370
Maybe it's just a rumor -and I understand your reaction,

254
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,580
but you drink a lot, don't you?

255
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,330
Every day, like 50 million people -in France. What's the problem?

256
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,790
Everybody gets on my case,

257
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,670
then fills their own glasses!

258
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,630
Good one, guys!

259
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,830
- Potentially, it's alcoholism. - So I'm an alcoholic?

260
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,500
If I'm an alcoholic, what's Fred?

261
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,920
Very cute.

262
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,170
I knew she'd cook something up.

263
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,460
What do you mean?

264
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,960
Her mother.

265
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,920
She wants to stop me seeing my daughter.

266
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,170
She's my daughter.

267
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,880
You want me to confess -so you can go party?

268
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,630
We get no confession bonus.

269
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,420
We just do our job. Protecting your -daughter if you hurt her.

270
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,510
She's 4!

271
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:09,050
Aged 4, you don't make up stuff -about Daddy scratching your bottom.

272
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,670
What about bathtime?

273
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,220
How does it work? -How do you Wash her?

274
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,760
I wash her with a washcloth and soap.

275
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,760
And her vagina? How do you do that, sir?

276
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,220
Yes, I use the cloth on her vagina.

277
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,050
You get a kick out of it?

278
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,050
No, I don't get a kick out of it!

279
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,010
We can't hold you any longer.

280
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,550
But the judges appreciate a confession.

281
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,050
Do you have anything to add?

282
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:40,970
No.

283
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,640
I have nothing to add.

284
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,970
I don't molest my daughter.

285
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,930
He's playing you. He can't admit he got -sexual pleasure from his daughter.

286
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,600
All I can say is, -he's not the usual prototype.

287
00:13:58,810 --> 00:13:59,850
Prototype?

288
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,180
Stereotype!

289
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,520
Same difference.

290
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,270
Alright, he's not your stereotypical...

291
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,930
Yeah, he's a tall guy,

292
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,390
a cuddly bear type of guy.

293
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,350
I don't know. He's not an ugly,

294
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,850
nasty-looking kinda guy...

295
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,850
Yeah, he seems really...

296
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,230
- Wholesome. - Okay.

297
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,230
But we'll run psychiatric tests -before we let him go.

298
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:26,650
Of course.

299
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,560
Was it her idea?

300
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,150
No, it was commissioned.

301
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,230
I saw the salesman -and asked him about the painting.

302
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,980
He starts -by saying his wife painted it.

303
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:44,020
She does photo-reportage, -documentary stuff. Really good photos.

304
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:48,530
So the guy gives him the same spiel, -while I step outside

305
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,320
and he says, 18,500 euros.

306
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,980
He must've been very rich.

307
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,980
I forgot something very important.

308
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,980
Just a second, -I have a gift for you.

309
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,070
For me?

310
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,490
Some people are so spoiled.

311
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:06,150
It's not much, but I like it.

312
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,570
Thank you. -This is very embarrassing.

313
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,780
Turn it so I can see.

314
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,780
That's Place...

315
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,360
It's very phallic!

316
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,240
She's leaving!

317
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,290
I really like it a lot. Really.

318
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,410
Thank your husband again.

319
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,210
I'm impressed, -so successful, so young.

320
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,540
You grew up in Paris?

321
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,330
Yes.

322
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,330
Which neighborhood?

323
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,170
Belleville.

324
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:17,040
I'll put you with CPU North. -Home ground.

325
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,880
- Morning, everybody. - Morning, chief.

326
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,830
This is...

327
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,790
Don't be shy.

328
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:29,790
This is Melissa Zaia, -who'll be with you for a few months

329
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,040
to take photos for a book -commissioned by the Ministry.

330
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,710
I'm relying on you -to help her feel at home

331
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,840
and get some great pictures.

332
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,250
Don't worry, -you can veto specific shots.

333
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,590
Have a good day!

334
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,960
Goodbye, chief.

335
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,960
Hello.

336
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,010
- Your chair, Bamako. - Sorry.

337
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,130
Iris.

338
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,630
Gabriel. Hi.

339
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,420
Fred.

340
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,970
- Croissant? - No, thanks.

341
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,340
- Pain au chocolat? - Maybe she's on a diet.

342
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,010
I only eat organic.

343
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,380
I can get organic croissants.

344
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:13,930
I won't throw you in -on a rape or pedophile case.

345
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:17,760
We'll ease you into it -with a Romanian pickpocket.

346
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,430
You speak Romanian?

347
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,970
What are the marks on your hands?

348
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,260
A cigarette?

349
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,930
Is that one day or several days?

350
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:33,720
Several days.

351
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,260
Any marks anywhere else?

352
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,020
Either you tell us -who's exploiting you

353
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,390
and we protect you, -with a home and education...

354
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,100
Or you say nothing, -go back to pickpocketing

355
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,060
and in a year -they'll pimp you out on the streets.

356
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,980
This isn't a game.

357
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,230
It's downhill from now on, understand?

358
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,390
Forget the pickpocket stuff.

359
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,480
She says it's her uncle.

360
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,060
Great.

361
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,600
What's your uncle called?

362
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:20,690
Mr. Caganescu.

363
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,650
And the prostitutes? -Who runs the prostitutes?

364
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,150
Is that your uncle?

365
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:27,730
Yes, it's her uncle.

366
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:29,770
Who's that?

367
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,650
Uncle.

368
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,570
- That's Caganescu? - Watch out.

369
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,570
What's in those two caravans there?

370
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,980
Children also.

371
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,190
Two caravans for the children?

372
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:47,900
Yes. Ten and ten.

373
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,780
Ten kids in each caravan?

374
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,400
You're gonna eat all that?

375
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:00,320
Delicious!

376
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,780
You're so lucky.

377
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,950
I look at a pastry, I put on 30 kilos.

378
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,740
Sure, but I run, kiddo.

379
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:10,110
An ass like mine takes effort. -We get 3 hours at lunch.

380
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,280
Don't waste it shopping,

381
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,820
go to a gym, work out, healthy stuff.

382
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:19,120
Cut out the romantic daydreaming. -Love and other bullshit.

383
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,950
Anyway, how do you feel?

384
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,700
Like a 40-year old cheated wife -about to get a divorce.

385
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,870
Keep your cool in court.

386
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:30,530
Make sure they know it hurt, see?

387
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,370
You copped a lot of shit, -but you're not gonna trash-talk.

388
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,330
They have to feel your pain -so you get custody.

389
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:41,080
Act the victim. -That's what you are. A victim.

390
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:42,490
Yeah.

391
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:47,000
By mutual agreement, -Mrs. Del takes the children on weekends,

392
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,460
and Mr. Del will have custody

393
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,790
on a daily basis, -due to Mrs. Del's profession.

394
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:57,790
Will you be using -your married name or maiden name?

395
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,540
Keeping your married name -is perfectly feasible.

396
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,620
It's up to you.

397
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,880
Okay, I'll keep it.

398
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,790
Fine. The married name.

399
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,960
You have a month -to appeal this decision.

400
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,750
If there are any divergences,

401
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,540
you can...

402
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,590
Cut it out!

403
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:53,260
Police. Can I see some ID, please?

404
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,090
Why?

405
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:58,550
I'm taking you in for questioning. -Now, let me see some ID.

406
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,880
Hey there.

407
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,300
Out with Mommy?

408
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,180
Yes.

409
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,090
My name's Iris, what's yours?

410
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,010
Antoine.

411
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,340
Poor thing!

412
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,510
He won't stop crying. -I'm sick of it.

413
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,550
- Shaking him quiets him? - Yes.

414
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,640
You do it often?

415
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,510
Sure.

416
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,140
How old are you?

417
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,430
Three and a half.

418
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,260
No school today?

419
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,180
- He doesn't go. - No?

420
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,060
3-years-olds have school.

421
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,510
You had an afternoon snack?

422
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,640
- Yes, he's eaten. - What did you have?

423
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,260
A sandwich.

424
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,060
That's an afternoon snack?

425
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,390
Forget the judge. -Take the children when you want.

426
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,720
I can lend you some money.

427
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,600
I'm fine, thanks.

428
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,020
All done.

429
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:47,640
And?

430
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:48,640
Super.

431
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,480
I got custody. -He was pathetic, seriously.

432
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,640
- And money? - All I need.

433
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:55,890
Fantastic.

434
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,310
- Meaning? - 1,000 euros.

435
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,600
- Great! - Yeah, I'm so pleased.

436
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,020
Why are you crying?

437
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,650
I'm not crying.

438
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,270
It's dumb, it'll pass. -Honestly, I feel fabulous.

439
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,560
- You had to do it. - What a fool!

440
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:16,480
It's for the sake of crying. -All done, I've stopped.

441
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,730
Great, it's a good thing done.

442
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,520
Yeah, it's a relief, in fact.

443
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:23,020
It was over so fast.

444
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:24,270
What?

445
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,780
The moment?

446
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:30,360
The moment when you make the break.

447
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,690
Were you emotional?

448
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,400
A bit. -But not really, in the end.

449
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:42,490
I got a woman taken in earlier. -Acting really weird with her kids.

450
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,320
Let's go, I'm gonna take her down.

451
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:49,490
Please! A woman with kids, -not right now.

452
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:50,820
To take your mind off it.

453
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:54,740
Can't we do a rape or gang rape? -It'd be cooler for me.

454
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,860
Come on.

455
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:00,200
How do you explain your first child -being calm at night,

456
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,780
when it's bedtime, -and not the second?

457
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,740
You raise them differently?

458
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,620
- Sure. - Meaning?

459
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,950
I don't jerk the little one off -every night.

460
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,410
The social worker told me to stop.

461
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:25,080
You don't jerk the little one off -every night

462
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,040
because you were told to stop.

463
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,750
Yeah, she said it was wrong, -so I stopped.

464
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,290
It's dumb. -It was the only thing that worked,

465
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,290
giving him a little handjob,

466
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,370
or blowjob sometimes.

467
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,080
A handjob put him to sleep in seconds.

468
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:44,210
If your husband comes home agitated, -you give him a pacifier?

469
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,710
No, I...

470
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:49,460
Do you realize what you're saying, -Mrs. Leclerc?

471
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:54,040
Do you realize -what you do to your boys is rape?

472
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,880
No way! I don't rape them. -I caress them, I kiss them.

473
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,960
What is rape for you?

474
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:01,580
It's when...

475
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,670
When there's penetration.

476
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,790
Any sexual act -between minor and parent is illegal.

477
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,210
You know that? -Does that ring any bells?

478
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:18,590
It's cool, the table fits, -so all 3 of us can eat in the kitchen.

479
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:21,380
Or 4 of you if you pull out the table.

480
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:24,670
What's the point? -There's only 3 of us eating.

481
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,260
This is the living room with...

482
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,380
my bed and...

483
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,460
It's pretty spacious, isn't it?

484
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:35,260
Spacious is maybe going too far.

485
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,510
- You have a view at least. - Here...

486
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,340
Take your ring back.

487
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,380
What for?

488
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,340
No marriage, no ring.

489
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,010
I brought your scales.

490
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,220
Can I assemble stuff?

491
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:54,180
No, thanks. -A friend's coming by to help.

492
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,720
If your friend's coming by, I'll go.

493
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,050
Just for me.

494
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,550
No, I don't want to.

495
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,600
It'll look good on the class photo.

496
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,510
No.

497
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,050
Here...

498
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,010
Look how cute it is.

499
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,510
I don't like it.

500
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,010
- Very pretty. - They'll all laugh at me.

501
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,010
Stop that now.

502
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,470
Okay, fine.

503
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,220
Go see your mother.

504
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,680
I give up.

505
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,020
She's decided -to be ugly for the photo.

506
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:25,970
What?

507
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,600
See you later.

508
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,890
I want to go to boarding school.

509
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,770
You want to go -to boarding school like Clémence? Why?

510
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:36,230
Daddy loves me too much.

511
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,980
All daddies -love their little girls too much.

512
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,890
What's all this about?

513
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:42,980
Mommy.

514
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,520
What?

515
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,100
He loves me too much.

516
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,560
What are you saying?

517
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,020
He can't hear us for the TV.

518
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,190
- Hold on. - Don't.

519
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,530
You okay?

520
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,530
Got any earplugs?

521
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,320
It's cool.

522
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,780
Okay...

523
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:22,320
Goodnight.

524
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,450
You have a good day?

525
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,110
Tell me.

526
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,030
Grim.

527
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,200
Grim?

528
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,870
I need to talk, to share stuff, Baloo.

529
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,160
You understand?

530
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,160
- You want us to talk? - Yes.

531
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,700
You want me to get home at night

532
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:58,160
and say, Hey, honey!

533
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:01,370
Wow, you made coconut chicken, -my favorite!

534
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,240
We're gonna have a great night.

535
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:06,370
I'll tell you -how a 74-year-old granddad

536
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,540
fucked his grandson up the ass.

537
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,790
Sure, if you put it like that...

538
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:14,290
I put it like that -because that's how it is.

539
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:17,410
Really? -You think I'm some airhead, don't you?

540
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,330
I deal with drama -all day long at the nursery.

541
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:24,370
Drama at your uptown nursery? -Purée instead of cream cheese?

542
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,710
What a drama!

543
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:29,080
- I don't want sex now. - Me neither.

544
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,120
Fuck it!

545
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,830
I gotta be up at 4. Goodnight!

546
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,830
Why 4?

547
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,870
I'm getting up at 4 in the morning

548
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,120
to snatch Romanian kids

549
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,120
from their family, -their parents, aunts, sisters,

550
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,540
put them in a shelter

551
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,710
and be a total asshole for them. -Maybe I am,

552
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,130
destroying their lives. -So I start at 4.

553
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:53,750
So your purée and cream cheese, -stick 'em up your ass! Dry!

554
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,710
You jerk!

555
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,000
You're out there saving humanity -with your buddy Fred,

556
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,880
saving the world's kids.

557
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:04,050
Incest's only in Belleville? -Where I work, they're all rich?

558
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,670
Don't be stupid.

559
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,550
You only get kids from Belleville -and the north?

560
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,090
There's no incest uptown?

561
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,130
Know what? Go sleep with Fred.

562
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,260
You piss me off, both of you!

563
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:20,090
You'll wind up in your studio, -like two misogynous assholes!

564
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,300
Fuck it!

565
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,090
Shit! You put whiskey in it?

566
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,180
Me?

567
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,510
- Tastes like shit, what is it? - Whiskey.

568
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,800
That's all I need.

569
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:43,550
Take the covers, I'm too hot! -I gotta cool down.

570
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,090
You cool down.

571
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,720
Welcome, everybody, -to the Caganescu operation.

572
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:55,930
Thanks to you all -from the Crime and Riot units,

573
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,760
and the judicial division -for coming along.

574
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:02,680
It's early, I know, -but Paris is pretty early morning.

575
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,600
The fog, the glistening streets.

576
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,810
Okay, you don't like my poetry. -I'll hand over to Capt. Gerard.

577
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:14,230
We're working with a mandate -from a Paris judge.

578
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,520
The charges are...

579
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:20,180
Inciting minors -to commit crimes as part of a gang.

580
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:24,100
Lieutenants Del and Langlois -will brief you on the details.

581
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,940
We're going to be -in radio contact on 41.

582
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,230
The signal will be given by Orange 1.

583
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:32,980
Transportation details -are on the route map.

584
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,230
We take the beltway to Montreuil,

585
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,900
down Rue Raspail in single file

586
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,980
and into the camp in our vehicles.

587
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,810
We arrest them right away?

588
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,860
No, wait to be told -and watch out in the caravans.

589
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,860
It's risky. -It's worth listening.

590
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,150
This is for your information.

591
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,520
We know the case, the danger. -You don't.

592
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,650
The single-file thing. Last time...

593
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:57,320
Turn onto Raspail here -and enter the camp here.

594
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,650
Single file -stops everything getting out of hand.

595
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,030
I was just asking.

596
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,860
We all park up here -and move in this way.

597
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,650
I'm not with my partner?

598
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,820
Mathieu!

599
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,820
Any other questions?

600
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,440
Not anymore, no.

601
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,620
Police!

602
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,910
Open up!

603
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,950
CPU! We're here about the kids. -Follow us, sir.

604
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,120
Any kids here?

605
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:15,080
Everybody out! -Get dressed first, please.

606
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,910
Faster than that, please.

607
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:17,960
Where are the kids?

608
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:19,750
Outside!

609
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,330
Move it!

610
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,160
There are 3 in here. -Where are the kids?

611
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:25,670
C'mon, hurry up!

612
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Calm down, sir. Keep calm!

613
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:31,710
We need backup here!

614
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,420
Baloo!

615
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:40,880
Give me the cuffs.

616
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,340
Give them their shoes.

617
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,960
Hands off our children!

618
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:53,920
You've no right to be here.

619
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,920
Don't worry, sir, -we play by the rules.

620
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:59,340
Yes, you'll have an attorney.

621
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,670
You're coming with us

622
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,840
somewhere warm, -where you'll get a hot meal.

623
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:06,510
You'll go to school -and play games, okay?

624
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:11,010
Sir, you're under arrest for inciting -minors to commit crimes as a gang.

625
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,300
Got that?

626
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:19,130
Yes, but in France -parents don't exploit their kids.

627
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,380
What did we do? -Why take our parents?

628
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,590
You haven't done anything.

629
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,840
There were five in the...

630
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,470
Nobody left in the tent?

631
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,140
Reassure them. -You're scaring them.

632
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,270
Tell them you'll see them again.

633
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,890
No, it's not our fault.

634
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,140
- Please, give me my sons. - No, sir.

635
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,810
Leave my children, please.

636
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,520
No, stay where you are.

637
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,480
You stay with your brother.

638
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,150
Reassure him.

639
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,060
It'll be okay, son.

640
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,060
What's your brother's name?

641
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,350
Gabriel, it's okay.

642
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,060
What's left to do?

643
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,520
We're done.

644
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:41,480
Reassure him.

645
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:51,610
Get on the bus nice and quietly. -We're going to a shelter.

646
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,900
You'll see your parents later.

647
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,530
You'll be together in the shelter.

648
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,740
Keep calm while we count you.

649
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,190
One, two,

650
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,440
three, four, five, six...

651
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,450
Those two little brothers...

652
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,860
We want a song!

653
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:18,250
Napoleon?

654
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,460
Julius Cesar?

655
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,920
<i>70,0 Gun!</i>

656
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,210
That's a Greek.

657
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,380
The Greek Way!

658
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,170
Boat...

659
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,960
A shark? Jaws!

660
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,960
<i>Robin Hood!</i>

661
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,090
The Emperor.

662
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:37,420
The first to America.

663
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,050
Christopher Columbus!

664
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:44,420
This is my house, -you could lose now and then.

665
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,250
I'm going to bed.

666
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,460
Bed, tent...

667
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,130
Tent!

668
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,300
<i>Carry On Camping!</i>

669
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:55,340
That was too easy!

670
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,760
That's easy!

671
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,180
Beard.

672
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,010
Arrogance!

673
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,380

676
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,970
When's our turn?

677
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,930
<i>Contempt. Godard!</i>

678
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,260
Look at Mathieu!

679
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,390
When's our next shag?

680
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,350
- Tonight. - Tonight?

681
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,930
You didn't tell me.

682
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,810
I wrote out a schedule, -it's on the fridge.

683
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:43,220
Fertile days are shaded red.

684
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:46,470
If you see it's red, -that means tonight...

685
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,100
Great! Wonderful!

686
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,470
Really?

687
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,930
You're my fave cum dump.

688
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,980
Don't say that -as if you have millions of them.

689
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,850
I fuck wherever I go.

690
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,350
I leave here and I fuck the cleaner.

691
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,600
At the bakery, -I fuck the baker's wife.

692
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:03,810
At work, I fuck the secretary.

693
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,390
Not funny.

694
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,810
Not funny?

695
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,770
Nothing is.

696
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,100
The office is fun, lunchtime's fun.

697
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,440
I like kidding around and here,

698
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,310
I can't open my mouth.

699
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,560
The difference is that I never say -work's fun and home sucks.

700
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,690
But who takes -the medication and shit? Me!

701
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:25,020
Who works out what days we shag? -Is that fun?

702
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,900
Is it fun -fucking when the fridge says so?

703
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:30,150
When We met, we didn't...

704
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,940
We just got it on, -without the check-the-fridge bullshit.

705
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:36,940
Nothing's changed for you, -so get off my back.

706
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,230
Chill. Look how...

707
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,320
Stop! Cut it out!

708
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,110
Got that? Don't talk to me like that.

709
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:44,980
I'm just trying to...

710
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,570
Shut up, okay?

711
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,150
Not cool.

712
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,360
And you want us to have a baby?

713
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:07,950
Come here.

714
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:10,030
Tell me what your problem is.

715
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,240
Thank you.

716
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,860
The pants, too.

717
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,410
What do you see?

718
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,160
I dunno.

719
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,200
I'm fat.

720
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:26,780
Fat?

721
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:29,030
You're a bag of bones.

722
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,120
Something's on your mind, -something's bugging you.

723
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:36,080
That's the issue -that stops you getting pregnant.

724
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:40,450
I love you but I won't take part -in a lie. Is that clear?

725
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,450
I want you to get better.

726
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,040
Fine.

727
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,330
Beat it then.

728
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,120
- Hi. - What are you doing here?

729
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:01,500
Hey, girls!

730
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,920
I need help with my talk.

731
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,960
A word with Mom first.

732
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:07,580
- Why? - Just a minute.

733
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,170
She's a pain.

734
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:12,670
I want us to have breakfast, -go shopping together.

735
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:14,920
I want us to laugh, fight, all that.

736
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,920
I want all that back. -I want to be with you again.

737
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:18,960
And your bimbo?

738
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:22,000
Stuff the bimbo! -It's been over for ages.

739
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,500
So you thought, talk to mommy, -she'll take me back with the kids.

740
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,460
And I go down on my knees, right?

741
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,420
Nadine! We weren't talking.

742
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:33,250
- Your job was everything! - I love my job.

743
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:37,840
Sorry, but unlike you, I love my job. -It's important for me.

744
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:41,960
You're my whole life! -You're beautiful, amazing, intelligent!

745
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:45,380
I can't imagine life without you, -don't you see?

746
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,590
Waking up without you?

747
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,220
You're the love of my life!

748
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,880
So was his slut -when he was eating her out!

749
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,720
Fuck it!

750
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:01,010
You'd have been proud of me. -I gave it to him.

751
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,510
I am proud of you.

752
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,470
I had his bimbo there, -flashing in my brain.

753
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,050
Men are the scum of the earth.

754
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:12,100
Yeah.

755
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,800
Don't cheat. -I'm watching you.

756
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:18,180
120.

757
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,430
I have 120,000 left.

758
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,260
My turn to cash in.

759
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,560
How much is it?

760
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,060
350,000 euros.

761
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,270
- Here I go. - My rent!

762
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,890
You nearly forgot.

763
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,930
- Is this for you? - Yes.

764
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,640
6 and 6.

765
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,680
The pancake comes first.

766
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,520
- You okay? - Fine.

767
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,480
I'm out of jail. I paid up.

768
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,520
What's your diet, Baloo?

769
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,020
Yes?

770
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,350
Send her up.

771
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:05,100
Incoming runaway!

772
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:07,020
Baloo, can I take her?

773
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,270
Go ahead.

774
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:09,940
You're keen.

775
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:13,650
It's not that. -I just never did a runaway.

776
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,810
Hi, everybody.

777
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,690
This is the runaway.

778
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,190
Follow me.

779
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,900
At home with her, -keep the lights on.

780
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,770
Her folks ran away?

781
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:30,030
The night before last? -Wednesday, you mean?

782
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,400
CPU here.

783
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,860
I'll send a team.

784
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,360
Change of plans!

785
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:43,320
Let's go!

786
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:45,900
A mother's abducted her baby.

787
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:49,400
She's dangerous, -mental issues, a junkie...

788
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,110
You too, Nora.

789
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,360
Melissa!

790
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,740
I'll radio through the details.

791
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,070
We got a blue light?

792
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,700
Grab the cuffs.

793
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,910
- Where is it? - Our 3rd car?

794
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:19,910
Fuck it!

795
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,580
- Where's our wheels? - Baloo!

796
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:29,660
Jesus!

797
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,870
We're missing a car!

798
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,370
Where's it gone?

799
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,000
Go ask Beauchard!

800
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,620
You others, get going.

801
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:38,790
I'm in front.

802
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:40,830
Keystone cops!

803
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:45,000
One car to the scene, -one cruising.

804
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:47,000
Let's go!

805
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:50,500
What's going on?

806
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,040
Narcotics needed a car.

807
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:56,080
What a surprise! -Narcotics needed it, as usual.

808
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,420
We're just looking for a baby -that his mom took from a home.

809
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:02,380
Dull old child protection.

810
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:03,330
Captain Gérard.

811
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,960
There's a hierarchy between units, -as you well know.

812
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:09,590
Yes, sir, but this woman's a druggie.

813
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:11,590
Dangerous, just out of jail.

814
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,460
I've got 8 guys downstairs

815
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:17,670
<i>ready to go looking for the kid -all over Belleville. With 2 cars!</i>

816
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,920
Yvan, I don't like you -losing your temper in my office.

817
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:25,630
Fuck it!

818
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,300
You got anything on?

819
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:30,800
Car keys!

820
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:34,050
Outside the café. The baby?

821
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,010
Fred!

822
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,880
CPU South's Scenic.

823
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:38,380
Outside the café.

824
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,880
All units, I'll take care of the home.

825
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:44,090
Chrys and Mathieu go door-to-door.

826
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:46,880
And Sue Ellen, post office and cafés.

827
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:49,800
If you see any weird mothers, -bring 'em in.

828
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:52,720
This is the mother's card.

829
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:54,680
You have a list of staff?

830
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,640
Yes.

831
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,800
Can I have a copy?

832
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,470
We toured the shelters. Nothing.

833
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,680
Maybe the photo will help.

834
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:07,970
The carer left to deal with a sick child -and that's when it happened.

835
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,060
She got out through that door.

836
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,640
- It's old. - The lock's broken.

837
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:15,220
Where did she go? -She climbed...

838
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:17,770
Over the wall with her son.

839
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,930
I need your full name.

840
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:21,270
Françoise...

841
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,220
- What's your name? - Morgane.

842
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:24,770
- How old are you? - 7.

843
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:27,020
My daughter's nearly the same age.

844
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:28,680
She's dangerous.

845
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:32,730
Don't feel incriminated, -We need to know what happened.

846
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:36,560
Sure, but I feel responsible. -I'm in charge here.

847
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:38,730
You went on the computer?

848
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:41,350
I'm proud of you, baby!

849
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:48,440
You know this woman?

850
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,270
Sure. That's Sylvie, guys.

851
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,230
You know her?

852
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,940
Does she come in regularly?

853
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:59,360
Pretty much every day.

854
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:00,810
Most recently?

855
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,060
This morning.

856
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:07,650
She has a baby. She was excited -about getting him back.

857
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:10,320
Had she been drinking?

858
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,820
Not at 8:30.

859
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:17,780
Previously, you've seen her -in different states during the day?

860
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,230
Yeah, sure.

861
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,690
Can you be more precise?

862
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,070
Everybody knows her.

863
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,860
She'll do anything for a pack of smokes.

864
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:28,070
What do you mean exactly?

865
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:31,820
Helping a guy out, you know.

866
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:33,320
No, I don't know.

867
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:35,990
Giving blowjobs for 10 euros.

868
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,280
She's often short of cash.

869
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:40,360
How do you know this, sir?

870
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,740
Everyone knows locally. -Lots of...

871
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:44,990
We don't mean her any harm, sir.

872
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:48,860
It's just that -her little baby's in danger.

873
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:52,450
We're Child Protection, -we won't put her in jail.

874
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:54,280
We just want to find her.

875
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,330
You were thirsty!

876
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,240
I'm pregnant.

877
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:09,790
I'm pregnant.

878
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:13,950
Seriously?

879
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:14,910
Yeah.

880
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,040
How far along?

881
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,950
3 months. I'm scared of losing it, -so I'm keeping it quiet.

882
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,660
You're putting me on.

883
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:23,540
- Seriously? - I'm pregnant.

884
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:25,870
With Alex?

885
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,250
Sure, he's my husband, isn't he?

886
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:29,620
Is he happy?

887
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,410
Of course, he is.

888
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,420
The girls went to grab a salad.

889
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:38,670
Anyway, -we won't hang around forever.

890
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:39,540
Sure, but...

891
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:41,790
Give the photos a rest, will you?

892
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:43,710
NoW's not the time.

893
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:46,250
We eat, We split.

894
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:51,920
Don't bother giving me that look.

895
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:55,210
I'm talking to you!

896
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,880
Have you seen the photos you've taken -since you've been with us?

897
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:00,540
Yes.

898
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:01,920
What are they like?

899
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:03,000
They're okay.

900
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:04,050
- Sorry? - Okay.

901
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:05,170
They're okay?

902
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:08,380
"Okay" cuts it -when we're running all over?

903
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:10,460
Back off. It's cool.

904
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:11,670
It's not cool.

905
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:16,550
You're pissed off -and you're taking it out on her.

906
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,960
A shit day, and she's copping it.

907
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:20,670
“Okay”!

908
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:23,720
Go on, take my picture if you want.

909
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:26,630
I'm not laughing.

910
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:30,470
The problem isn't you expressing -a derogatory opinion.

911
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:31,550
Mr. Peach Fuzz!

912
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,970
It's the manner -you choose to express it.

913
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:35,880
We're not photographers.

914
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:39,390
- We can't do her job. - But we know our jobs.

915
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:41,010
And all I see is...

916
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:45,760
Seeing her go click-click-clack, -as soon as a kid starts crying.

917
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:47,220
That's not what we do.

918
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:49,300
It's more complex than that.

919
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:52,100
Am I right or wrong?

920
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:55,850
My problem is, -I don't see her getting the right shots.

921
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:56,760
Such as?

922
00:47:56,930 --> 00:47:58,890
What we're doing out here now.

923
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:03,350
All day, we're out looking, -and I don't feel her behind my back.

924
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:05,680
We get some fries -and clack-clack-click.

925
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:07,430
A kid starts crying...

926
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:08,520
clack-clack-clack.

927
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,680
When it's gritty or miserablist, -she's there.

928
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,060
She's finding her feet.

929
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:14,680
I don't give a shit!

930
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:17,730
I get what he's saying -about miserablism,

931
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:21,520
not wanting to put out -a bad image of the CPU.

932
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:23,770
It's just we're eating, on-edge.

933
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:26,640
- Your choice of words is all wrong. - You done?

934
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:27,850
Say it nicely.

935
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:31,190
We know you're angling -to get some pussy time.

936
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,480
So whatever you say doesn't count.

937
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,060
You're ripping on me now?

938
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,900
What's going on?

939
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:41,350
What?

940
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,270
What's going on? Nothing.

941
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,900
- Nothing. - No, why?

942
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:47,110
We eat and get back on it.

943
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,400
Sorry, but pictures of kids...

944
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:51,360
It's 11 o'clock, home time!

945
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:54,320
It's dark. We won't find them now.

946
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,360
You're clock-watching now?

947
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,400
We've been at it all day, -sweating blood!

948
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,940
I know, Fred.

949
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:02,940
Just do as I say, don't argue.

950
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:04,780
There's a baby out there!

951
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:05,980
$0?

952
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:09,690
The night team'll take over. He won't be all alone.

953
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,650
Go home.

954
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:13,690
What will they do if he dies?

955
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:16,030
I said, go home!

956
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:21,400
Night, everybody. -See you tomorrow.

957
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:23,280
We'll find him tomorrow!

958
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:37,030
Maybe she's dyed her hair -so nobody recognizes her.

959
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:40,030
Bullshit! -This isn't a western.

960
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:44,370
Is pear nice?

961
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:45,370
Sure, it's nice.

962
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:46,700
How much is it?

963
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:48,240
2.20 euros.

964
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:49,620
Will you give it to me?

965
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:50,700
I can't, lady.

966
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,530
Is that her?

967
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,080
It's a guy on rollerblades!

968
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,540
Chrys, slow down.

969
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,290
Take it easy.

970
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:03,160
That's why I said slow down.

971
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:05,620
I said slow down, so slow down.

972
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:08,040
You can spare something. -He's hungry!

973
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,450
- You have to pay! - He's hungry!

974
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:13,250
<i>Baloo to Fred.</i>

975
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:17,660
<i>Mother and baby -reported at a convenience store</i>

976
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:21,540
<i>at 19, Rue de Meaux.</i>

977
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,120
- Go, pops! - Good news at last!

978
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:27,210
- Copy, Fred? - I copy.

979
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,290
Get out the way!

980
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:50,420
Where have you been?

981
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,250
- We're here now! - We've been waiting 30 mins!

982
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,920
Calm down, we just got here.

983
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:58,090
It's only been 20 minutes!

984
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,250
Hi. Child Protection Unit.

985
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:05,760
He's critical. -We gotta get the baby to the hospital.

986
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,090
- It's been half an hour. - We came as fast...

987
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,800
You expect an invitation or what?

988
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:15,670
- We do the best we can. - So do we!

989
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,930
We came straight here.

990
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:19,260
We've been called to a bank heist.

991
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:23,550
We're not Child Protection, -with all due respect.

992
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:27,430
Can we take the details -because the mother isn't...

993
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,760
It wasn't me! -He made me drop my baby!

994
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:32,050
She threw him.

995
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:34,010
She threw her baby?

996
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:38,510
The doc says the baby's life -is in serious danger.

997
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,350
They're taking him to Necker.

998
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:46,390
Bring the buggy! That's my buggy!

999
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:50,890
Can We go with you and the baby?

1000
00:51:58,430 --> 00:52:00,390
Where's my baby?

1001
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:03,600
At the hospital. -We'll get more news later.

1002
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:05,890
It's hard having the baby.

1003
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:08,480
Having the baby? Having a baby?

1004
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:11,480
It wasn't easy having the baby.

1005
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:14,060
Why's she telling me this?

1006
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:16,600
Keep moving. -You're going to sit in there.

1007
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:17,890
Give me a cigarette.

1008
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:18,890
Not right now.

1009
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:21,730
Give me a cigarette. -You're nice, I like you.

1010
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:24,770
Give me a smoke.

1011
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,730
Can I get a smoke?

1012
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,110
Just sit there nice and quiet.

1013
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:31,980
Let's get the cuffs off.

1014
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:34,230
Sit down there.

1015
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:36,110
Yeah, sure.

1016
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:38,440
Sit down, relax, we'll be back.

1017
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:41,360
We'll have a talk when you calm down.

1018
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,730
I'm thirsty.

1019
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:45,820
There's nothing to drink right now.

1020
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:47,860
Police. Handcuffs. Prison.

1021
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:49,400
That's life.

1022
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:53,940
If there's a child, the officers -can't intervene at the scene.

1023
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:56,780
They have to wait until We get there.

1024
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:00,110
That's why there's always -some tension between us.

1025
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:02,900
You called the hospital?

1026
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:05,280
Of course, I called the hospital.

1027
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,610
How old's the baby?

1028
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,700
6-9 months.

1029
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:24,280
There's nothing happening.

1030
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:25,370
Thanks.

1031
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,160
Child Protection.

1032
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,370
You're getting on?

1033
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:53,910
And you?

1034
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:56,910
I don't understand this person.

1035
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:01,620
The baby's out of danger.

1036
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:03,250
Let's celebrate.

1037
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:04,290
What's going on?

1038
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:06,210
The baby's out of the coma.

1039
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:07,910
Great!

1040
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,790
Champagne!

1041
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:40,710
Do you wanna dance or not?

1042
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:42,710
You don't wanna dance?

1043
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,070
Give me a break, -I haven't been drinking.

1044
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:26,120
Sister, dance with me.

1045
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:53,120
What's with the glasses?

1046
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:54,910
They're just glasses.

1047
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,370
Can I?

1048
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:02,960
Keep in time, ma'am.

1049
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:07,330
They're fakes. They're a prop.

1050
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:12,040
I was scared -nobody'd take me seriously.

1051
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,790
You think the glasses and granny look

1052
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,000
make people take you seriously?

1053
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,000
I don't know.

1054
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:28,000
Okay, I get it.

1055
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:29,340
Let your hair down.

1056
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:31,960
You want me to let my hair down?

1057
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:34,130
Enough of the granny look!

1058
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:18,530
- Aren't they beautiful? - Total babes!

1059
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:20,030
It's a fashion show.

1060
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,990
Except they're not models.

1061
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:25,790
Be nice.

1062
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:27,620
Give 'em a breath test!

1063
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:29,910
You never know!

1064
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,080
Keep everyone safe.

1065
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:34,370
I warned you!

1066
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:36,450
- Any questions? - No, sir!

1067
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:37,500
Ready?

1068
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:39,290
Eye and ear protection on.

1069
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:43,500
Draw your weapon. Chamber.

1070
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,750
In position. One round.

1071
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:48,750
Switch legs. Other foot forward.

1072
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,250
One round.

1073
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:52,460
Mathieu.

1074
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:54,290
Wake up.

1075
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:56,040
- It's our turn. - Get lost!

1076
00:59:57,580 --> 00:59:59,250
- How do you feel? - Okay, I guess.

1077
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:00,620
Try breathing.

1078
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:02,710
Ready to go?

1079
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:05,330
Can't say I'm a fan, but let's try.

1080
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:07,000
Draw your gun. Chamber.

1081
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:10,000
Get into position.

1082
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,380
Three rounds.

1083
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:16,590
It's a peach kir royal.

1084
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:18,790
I like it sweet.

1085
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:24,170
Feeling okay?

1086
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:27,630
Sorry I'm late.

1087
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:30,300
Hey.

1088
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:33,760
You buy organic croissants?

1089
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,300
Shut it.

1090
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:48,800
Not one hit!

1091
01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:51,590
A complete disaster!

1092
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:52,800
I'm peace and love.

1093
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:55,340
Next group to the range.

1094
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:56,630
Let's go.

1095
01:00:58,680 --> 01:00:59,970
Gonna get some pics?

1096
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:05,430
Can her ladyship stop jigging around?

1097
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:12,180
Sorry.

1098
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:16,430
Rack the slide.

1099
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,180
Chamber a round.

1100
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:21,140
Two hands, knees bent, feet parallel.

1101
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:26,470
Decock.

1102
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:28,720
All together.

1103
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:30,930
Two rounds!

1104
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:34,270
Decock.

1105
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:36,100
Wanna try?

1106
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,060
Do you want to try?

1107
01:01:40,310 --> 01:01:41,100
Can she try?

1108
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:42,520
Shooting?

1109
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,060
No, catching a bus.

1110
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:47,100
Careful of the gun. Take her camera.

1111
01:01:48,730 --> 01:01:50,190
Snap away, Fred.

1112
01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:53,940
Let's make it easier for the lady.

1113
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:55,770
On my whistle,

1114
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:57,480
you fire two rounds.

1115
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,730
Careful, finger's on the trigger.

1116
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:03,230
Stay focused, -this is a firing range.

1117
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,980
Arms outstretched, elbows in.

1118
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:09,150
When I whistle, -you fire two rounds.

1119
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:14,730
- It doesn't work. - Press!

1120
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:19,860
Deep breaths.

1121
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:21,150
You'll be fine.

1122
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:22,570
Take deep breaths.

1123
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:26,860
Second round.

1124
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:28,480
Let's go.

1125
01:02:30,610 --> 01:02:31,820
What about the whistle?

1126
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:33,490
A quick whistle?

1127
01:02:33,610 --> 01:02:34,650
To relax you?

1128
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:40,820
There you go.

1129
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:42,990
Relax. Let go.

1130
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:43,900
Breathe out.

1131
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:46,070
Let go of the gun.

1132
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:48,570
Take your fingers off. Relax.

1133
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:50,950
You can do it. There you go.

1134
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:56,240
Evening.

1135
01:02:58,740 --> 01:02:59,820
My children.

1136
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,660
And my children's father.

1137
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:05,030
Evening, ladies.

1138
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,910
- Lucie and Bianca. - How old are they?

1139
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,200
6. They're twins.

1140
01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:10,370
- You ordered some food? - Yeah, pizza.

1141
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:12,410
She called Pizza Hut.

1142
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:13,120
Pizza Hut.

1143
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:15,330
Ever had truffle pizza?

1144
01:03:20,450 --> 01:03:21,240
Good?

1145
01:03:21,410 --> 01:03:23,080
Thanks, Francesco.

1146
01:03:23,330 --> 01:03:25,410
It tastes a bit like marzipan.

1147
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:32,710
How's Melissa doing?

1148
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:34,080
She's so sweet.

1149
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:35,960
Sweet Melissa!

1150
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:39,580
I know the boss man well.

1151
01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:40,920
Beauchard.

1152
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:43,620
- The chief? - He's a friend of mine.

1153
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:44,670
A friend?

1154
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:47,540
Not a friend. -We know each other well.

1155
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:51,290
So you both live here then, right?

1156
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,670
Tactless, apparently.

1157
01:03:54,830 --> 01:03:57,040
We said no personal questions.

1158
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,790
It isn't his apartment.

1159
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:01,170
- I live opposite. - Not bad!

1160
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:02,170
2 rents!

1161
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:04,460
You've never lived together?

1162
01:04:04,790 --> 01:04:05,460
You're a couple?

1163
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:06,670
Even with kids?

1164
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:07,630
We're a couple?

1165
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,170
Are you a couple?

1166
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:19,130
It's strange us being on call -on a holiday, isn't it?

1167
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,170
Why's it strange?

1168
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:26,510
I thought the night team -was on call on public holidays.

1169
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:28,800
They are. At night.

1170
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:34,340
It's not easy to get your head around. -The night team Works nights.

1171
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:38,840
In the daytime, they rest up -and the day team takes over.

1172
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:40,090
Is it clear now?

1173
01:04:40,430 --> 01:04:41,180
Sure.

1174
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:42,590
Night at night.

1175
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:46,140
Hi, everybody!

1176
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:51,300
This lady is having a few problems. -I'll let her explain.

1177
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:55,300
Hello, ma'am.

1178
01:04:55,470 --> 01:04:56,970
Take a seat.

1179
01:04:58,180 --> 01:04:59,850
Get the kid a chair.

1180
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:04,100
Sit down next to Mommy.

1181
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:08,260
Go ahead, ma'am.

1182
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:11,060
I have to give you my son.

1183
01:05:11,260 --> 01:05:13,890
I have no place where we slept.

1184
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:16,850
I don't want him -to sleep in street with me.

1185
01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:18,850
I want him in warm place.

1186
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:20,060
You want him...

1187
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,060
- Warm. - Somewhere warm, okay.

1188
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:27,390
He must sleep in bed.

1189
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:28,520
Of course.

1190
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:31,270
I don't want him be like me.

1191
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:34,350
You see?

1192
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,350
Sure, I understand.

1193
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,770
- You have nowhere to sleep. - Yes.

1194
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:43,850
Let's see. Are you married?

1195
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:45,600
I'm on my own.

1196
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:47,650
You're both on the street?

1197
01:05:47,850 --> 01:05:48,610
Yes.

1198
01:05:48,770 --> 01:05:51,440
- How long on the street? - Six months.

1199
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:55,520
Sleeping hostesses. -Hotels and hostesses.

1200
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:56,820
Hostesses?

1201
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:58,690
In hospices!

1202
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:02,610
No more.

1203
01:06:03,570 --> 01:06:06,320
Sleeping under tents.

1204
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:09,820
Sleep in tents. I not...

1205
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:14,150
Yes, I understand. -It's hard for you and your son.

1206
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:17,190
How long -since you had somewhere to wash?

1207
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:20,070
Since we had... hotels...

1208
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,190
Kicked out.

1209
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,860
Kicked out of a hotel?

1210
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:25,900
Because no money.

1211
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:28,490
I'm tired and it's cold.

1212
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:34,240
What's your name?

1213
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:38,570
Ousman.

1214
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:43,530
I must be away from my son.

1215
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:44,990
I give you my son.

1216
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:47,370
He wants to stay with his mommy.

1217
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:48,990
Yes, but no more.

1218
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:56,080
We'll find a nice place for both of you.

1219
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,530
Somewhere warm to sleep. -You understand?

1220
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:01,580
Yes, I look in all hospices.

1221
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:03,410
Many people, nothing.

1222
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:05,160
They say no room.

1223
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:08,740
But we know more hospices. -We'll call other shelters.

1224
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:11,700
Have you had anything to eat, ma'am?

1225
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:12,750
No.

1226
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:14,500
Hungry, Ousman?

1227
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:16,160
Are you hungry?

1228
01:07:16,790 --> 01:07:19,200
Not hungry. Because he tired.

1229
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:23,160
When you struggle, you not eat. -That's right.

1230
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:25,410
We'll call all over.

1231
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:29,580
To try to find somewhere warm -for you and your son.

1232
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:32,420
If you no find, I give you my son.

1233
01:07:32,670 --> 01:07:35,000
I can't take your son, you understand?

1234
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:38,000
I don't want him become like me.

1235
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:40,290
I'll get them some food.

1236
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:41,710
Come with us.

1237
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:47,500
See you later. -Leave it with us.

1238
01:07:49,710 --> 01:07:50,670
Okay, action.

1239
01:08:02,090 --> 01:08:03,250
Not before next week?

1240
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,510
She said to call back.

1241
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:08,260
I have 2 that'll take the kid.

1242
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:10,170
The kid but not his mother.

1243
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:18,130
You gotta talk to Beauchard.

1244
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,010
No, not Beauchard.

1245
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:24,010
So we just sit here -flapping away helplessly.

1246
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:26,050
You're a pain in the ass!

1247
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:28,880
You're useless, fuck it!

1248
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:32,760
Don't let Fred go on up there.

1249
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:33,930
Hey, pops!

1250
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:35,390
Why didn't you 90?

1251
01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:37,090
The guy makes me puke.

1252
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:40,970
He hasn't got any balls. -He'll never take a stand.

1253
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:44,350
Fuck taking a stand, -show us you've got balls!

1254
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:45,680
- Me? -' Yes, you!

1255
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:49,720
- Show I've got balls? - You're the boss. It's your job.

1256
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:54,060
Calm down, we're not alone here. -The young man's totally bemused.

1257
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:57,930
You can't let Fred take the heat. -It's outrageous!

1258
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,390
Don't tell me my job!

1259
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:01,850
Shut up a second. No more!

1260
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:03,430
Women's Lib, can it!

1261
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,850
Women's Lib? -Stick it up your ass.

1262
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:09,350
A woman speaks out and she's a radical. -Fuck you!

1263
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,480
And your grow-a-pair crap?

1264
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:16,440
Mr. Coutard, you keep bothering me -but I can't intervene in every case.

1265
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:19,350
One phone call is all you need to make.

1266
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,060
You're taking this too personally.

1267
01:09:22,230 --> 01:09:23,560
Down, Fido!

1268
01:09:24,390 --> 01:09:26,350
- Just put the child in a home. - Pardon me?

1269
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:27,940
My last word.

1270
01:09:28,730 --> 01:09:30,310
That's it, your last word?

1271
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:31,150
Stop it, Fred.

1272
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:33,730
Calm down!

1273
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:34,810
Calm down? Sure.

1274
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:36,350
You know it's pointless.

1275
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:37,480
You keep calm, guys!

1276
01:09:37,650 --> 01:09:39,110
That earns you a warning.

1277
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:40,860
It won't be the first.

1278
01:09:48,690 --> 01:09:50,320
Pops, let's talk.

1279
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:53,610
Please, give them to me 3 days.

1280
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:55,860
I'll find them a hospice.

1281
01:09:56,570 --> 01:09:58,320
No, don't do that.

1282
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:00,190
Please.

1283
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:04,780
You can't do that.

1284
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:09,990
Why don't you? -Why don't you take them?

1285
01:10:10,110 --> 01:10:14,450
You or me, it's the same. -You know that's not the problem.

1286
01:10:14,650 --> 01:10:15,740
It's not the same.

1287
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:17,780
Don't make it so personal.

1288
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:20,740
Is he your kid? No, so stop.

1289
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:38,910
Okay, ma'am...

1290
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:42,990
For now, -we don't have a satisfactory solution.

1291
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,700
We're not at all satisfied with this.

1292
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:50,120
We've found a hospice for your son, -but not for you together.

1293
01:10:50,290 --> 01:10:52,700
I knew you not find for both.

1294
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:53,990
It's the best we have.

1295
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:58,120
It'll be okay.

1296
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:04,830
Come on, it's okay.

1297
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:12,460
We'll take good care of him, ma'am.

1298
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:15,460
Ousman! Calm down, kiddo.

1299
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:18,500
Mommy loves you. -She's not abandoning you.

1300
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:20,080
She has no choice.

1301
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:22,170
We'll look after you, son.

1302
01:11:22,290 --> 01:11:23,500
Calm down.

1303
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:40,750
It'll be okay.

1304
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,090
Mommy has no choice.

1305
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:46,590
She wants to be with you, too, -but she can't.

1306
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:10,670
There'll be other little boys like you.

1307
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,510
You won't be alone. -There'll be other kids who are sad.

1308
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:17,470
There'll be kids you can talk to.

1309
01:12:18,430 --> 01:12:20,300
You won't be all alone.

1310
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:37,550
Can you hear me?

1311
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,220
It's over now.

1312
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:42,260
It'll be okay.

1313
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:45,640
It's over, calm down.

1314
01:12:51,890 --> 01:12:52,770
You okay?

1315
01:12:53,390 --> 01:12:54,680
Feeling better now?

1316
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,310
C'mon, dry your eyes.

1317
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:15,650
You'll make lots of friends.

1318
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:20,100
It's just hard to begin with.

1319
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:23,110
It's tough, -but it won't last long, okay?

1320
01:13:25,650 --> 01:13:27,150
Your mommy loves you.

1321
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:33,070
You're a big, strong boy.

1322
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:35,270
She wants you to be strong.

1323
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,440
You remember?

1324
01:13:37,730 --> 01:13:39,360
You have to try every day.

1325
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:41,570
You hear me?

1326
01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:08,900
- I'll drive you home. - No, thanks.

1327
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:13,110
See you tomorrow.

1328
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,160
See you tomorrow.

1329
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,120
What are you doing? Staying?

1330
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:20,410
See you tomorrow.

1331
01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:37,370
You try to handle it case-by-case.

1332
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:38,450
But no.

1333
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:43,290
It won't help change the world -or anything.

1334
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:47,660
But it sticks in my throat, -it tears me up.

1335
01:14:47,870 --> 01:14:49,040
I can't do it!

1336
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,290
I have great news.

1337
01:15:31,710 --> 01:15:33,840
- We're all going on vacation. - Cool!

1338
01:15:34,210 --> 01:15:35,750
Are you pleased?

1339
01:15:36,050 --> 01:15:36,960
And you?

1340
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:39,960
- Are you angry? - No.

1341
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:42,960
Go to your room.

1342
01:15:43,130 --> 01:15:44,170
Your room.

1343
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:45,590
Okay, come on.

1344
01:15:49,970 --> 01:15:51,050
What's wrong?

1345
01:15:51,970 --> 01:15:55,260
I can't just go on vacation. -I've got photos to do.

1346
01:15:58,170 --> 01:15:59,300
You've got someone?

1347
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:03,130
I don't know.

1348
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:07,340
Great.

1349
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:09,300
I'm happy for you.

1350
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:10,640
Happy?

1351
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:11,840
Really.

1352
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:16,340
I know I can't give you -the life you want.

1353
01:16:17,890 --> 01:16:19,180
It's my problem.

1354
01:16:19,510 --> 01:16:21,100
Okay, fine.

1355
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:23,680
You're happy, I'm happy. Wonderful!

1356
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,720
Let's talk -when you stop pretending.

1357
01:16:48,850 --> 01:16:50,640
Wait a second...

1358
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:54,850
Alright, you can come now.

1359
01:17:11,190 --> 01:17:12,100
What is this?

1360
01:17:12,310 --> 01:17:13,270
Just drive.

1361
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:16,690
Keep your head still.

1362
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:18,480
Expressionless, please.

1363
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:27,020
Right, strip search.

1364
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:29,190
Please, Chrystelle.

1365
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:36,780
Put those on the chair there.

1366
01:17:40,650 --> 01:17:43,110
Okay, you can get dressed now.

1367
01:17:43,610 --> 01:17:46,150
- You believe your daughter? - Yes.

1368
01:17:46,570 --> 01:17:48,900
I know what my husband's like.

1369
01:17:49,150 --> 01:17:51,320
It's exactly his style.

1370
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:54,780
His style? What do you mean?

1371
01:17:59,530 --> 01:18:02,990
You're referring -to what your daughter told you?

1372
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:03,780
Yes.

1373
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:05,660
Can you be more specific?

1374
01:18:05,910 --> 01:18:07,620
It's embarrassing.

1375
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:10,320
We won't find it vulgar or disgusting.

1376
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:13,700
We could be talking -about cooking or clothes.

1377
01:18:13,870 --> 01:18:16,450
What does he like? What turns him on?

1378
01:18:18,870 --> 01:18:20,410
Toys?

1379
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:22,280
I'm sorry.

1380
01:18:22,490 --> 01:18:23,620
Garters and stockings?

1381
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:25,780
G-strings?

1382
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:28,990
Latex? Fabrics?

1383
01:18:29,370 --> 01:18:30,490
Leather?

1384
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:34,490
Different positions? -Fellatio? Exhibitionism?

1385
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:36,330
I don't know, lingerie?

1386
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:38,410
That's right, lingerie.

1387
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:40,700
Don't agree for our benefit.

1388
01:18:41,290 --> 01:18:44,160
Anything more... -I don't mean deviant,

1389
01:18:44,290 --> 01:18:46,160
but that shocked you maybe?

1390
01:18:48,410 --> 01:18:50,120
You have an active sex-life?

1391
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:51,790
That's personal.

1392
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:54,170
Here, We discuss personal matters.

1393
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:56,080
We're not strangers on a train.

1394
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:58,210
So, an active sex-life?

1395
01:18:58,370 --> 01:19:00,170
Great movie, -Strangers on a Train.

1396
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:04,670
Seen it? No, you're too young.

1397
01:19:05,330 --> 01:19:06,880
You think we're stupid?

1398
01:19:10,290 --> 01:19:11,420
Not at all.

1399
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:13,500
We need to know, ma'am.

1400
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:18,380
Your husband allegedly raped -your daughter. In terms of his fantasies,

1401
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,840
I need more detail -than just "lingerie."

1402
01:19:25,630 --> 01:19:27,460
He'd blindfold himself.

1403
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:29,420
Okay.

1404
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,460
- He blindfolded himself? - Why?

1405
01:19:32,050 --> 01:19:34,460
Can you guess what he was imagining?

1406
01:19:39,090 --> 01:19:42,090
We'll get you a glass of water.

1407
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:44,050
We'll talk when you feel better.

1408
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:48,670
A bald pubis, like a little girl's.

1409
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:50,590
That turns me on.

1410
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,380
You know you're on camera?

1411
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:56,130
So what?

1412
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:06,220
You were saying, -about little girls...

1413
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:13,430
We need help -with a screwed-up reverse Oedipus.

1414
01:20:19,010 --> 01:20:21,310
A screwed-up reverse Oedipus!

1415
01:20:21,970 --> 01:20:23,350
And your fantasies?

1416
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:28,600
Sorry.

1417
01:20:30,930 --> 01:20:32,470
What do you imagine?

1418
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:35,520
That I'm making love to my daughter.

1419
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:41,060
Shocked?

1420
01:20:41,810 --> 01:20:42,770
Yes, We are.

1421
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:44,020
What do you imagine?

1422
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:45,730
We're not in your chair.

1423
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:47,390
We ask the questions.

1424
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:02,150
Do you have an active sex-life?

1425
01:21:02,310 --> 01:21:03,230
Who with?

1426
01:21:03,810 --> 01:21:05,270
Your wife perhaps.

1427
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:06,440
Hold on...

1428
01:21:06,610 --> 01:21:07,690
I already asked.

1429
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:11,270
I answered that already. Normal.

1430
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:13,110
That doesn't fit.

1431
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:16,190
Your wife says -you haven't touched her in years.

1432
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:20,150
Maybe I was being optimistic. -To spare her feelings.

1433
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:22,360
This isn't a sex therapy session.

1434
01:21:22,940 --> 01:21:23,860
Sodomy?

1435
01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:26,730
Not particularly.

1436
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:29,490
Is that, yes he likes it or not?

1437
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:32,190
No, that's not what I meant.

1438
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,530
Let me explain. -We're not judging you.

1439
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:38,360
We want the truth. -We don't care which way you like it.

1440
01:21:38,740 --> 01:21:41,360
We just want -to get a picture of your husband.

1441
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:45,280
These questions aren't about you, -they're about him.

1442
01:21:45,490 --> 01:21:48,740
To find out what he maybe did -to your daughter. Get that?

1443
01:21:48,910 --> 01:21:50,740
We don't judge, We don't care.

1444
01:21:51,910 --> 01:21:52,700
Sodomy?

1445
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:54,700
Yes.

1446
01:21:57,370 --> 01:21:58,820
Every time?

1447
01:22:03,570 --> 01:22:05,030
Did he threaten you?

1448
01:22:07,910 --> 01:22:08,910
Yeah.

1449
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,160
Yeah or yes?

1450
01:22:10,370 --> 01:22:11,160
Yes.

1451
01:22:12,410 --> 01:22:14,540
I don't rape her, -I make love to her.

1452
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:17,200
She gives herself to me.

1453
01:22:17,740 --> 01:22:20,240
Young children -have a right to sexual liberty.

1454
01:22:20,370 --> 01:22:22,080
Quit acting like we're idiots!

1455
01:22:22,290 --> 01:22:23,120
You're getting 20!

1456
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:24,620
I doubt that.

1457
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,450
What are you saying, "I doubt that"?

1458
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:29,450
- I just know. - You know shit!

1459
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:36,710
- I take liberties, too. - That'll cost you dear.

1460
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:38,790
- Pardon me? - It'll cost you dear.

1461
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,670
Sit your ass down.

1462
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:42,460
Right now!

1463
01:22:42,830 --> 01:22:44,120
Mathieu, please.

1464
01:22:44,290 --> 01:22:45,870
Let's calm things down.

1465
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,120
- What? - You hit me.

1466
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:48,250
Nobody saw a thing.

1467
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:49,500
The camera neither.

1468
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:52,130
The camera sees what it wants here.

1469
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,920
Fine.

1470
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:59,040
What do you mean by "I doubt that"?

1471
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:01,840
You doubt you'll get 20 years?

1472
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:03,170
Yes?

1473
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:04,540
Okay.

1474
01:23:05,210 --> 01:23:06,710
I have connections.

1475
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:08,670
Fine, sir.

1476
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:14,210
I got a call. -Go easy on La Faublaise.

1477
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:15,500
Sorry?

1478
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:17,170
Just treat him good.

1479
01:23:18,710 --> 01:23:19,840
Say something!

1480
01:23:21,380 --> 01:23:22,840
I treat him like a child rapist.

1481
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:24,130
Do as I say.

1482
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:26,630
- I do my job. - Do as I say!

1483
01:23:28,090 --> 01:23:29,880
- He's right. - You read the statements?

1484
01:23:30,050 --> 01:23:32,670
You're right, too. -Just take it down a notch.

1485
01:23:32,970 --> 01:23:35,090
He's right, I'm right...

1486
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:36,760
Don't worry about it.

1487
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,220
I worry about winding up like you.

1488
01:23:46,050 --> 01:23:49,220
You realize at no stage -you express any remorse?

1489
01:23:51,430 --> 01:23:52,510
Anyone home?

1490
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:54,890
Go to the Internet section.

1491
01:23:55,510 --> 01:23:56,140
No, I...

1492
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:58,220
The Internet section.

1493
01:24:06,260 --> 01:24:07,510
What's he on?

1494
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:10,310
A run'll do you good.

1495
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:11,760
You're shitting me?

1496
01:24:11,930 --> 01:24:12,810
No.

1497
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:14,770
You're shitting me.

1498
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:15,890
It's still my case?

1499
01:24:16,180 --> 01:24:17,060
No.

1500
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:21,600
Wait for me.

1501
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:24,560
I wanna see my daughter. I'll call you.

1502
01:25:00,730 --> 01:25:03,770
Mommy always gets in the bath with me.

1503
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:06,820
Mommy, sure. -For daddies, it's different.

1504
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:10,860
Here, wash yourself with soap.

1505
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:12,940
Ready?

1506
01:25:15,530 --> 01:25:16,280
Then the back.

1507
01:25:17,110 --> 01:25:18,400
Your botty. Rub rub.

1508
01:25:18,740 --> 01:25:19,740
Between your legs.

1509
01:25:19,940 --> 01:25:22,360
Your bits. Your girly bits.

1510
01:25:22,530 --> 01:25:25,150
That's good. -Careful you don't slip. Rub rub.

1511
01:25:25,450 --> 01:25:27,740
You promise you won't leave again?

1512
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:29,200
I'll try, sure.

1513
01:25:29,570 --> 01:25:31,530
If you give me a hug.

1514
01:25:35,490 --> 01:25:36,990
Come eat, Fred.

1515
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:45,950
C'mon...

1516
01:25:46,410 --> 01:25:47,740
Disconnect.

1517
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:49,700
Come eat.

1518
01:26:08,620 --> 01:26:09,870
Again! Again!

1519
01:26:11,790 --> 01:26:12,830
Go on, push!

1520
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,450
And again.

1521
01:26:14,660 --> 01:26:16,830
Hold your breath and push!

1522
01:26:17,660 --> 01:26:18,790
Can I stop?

1523
01:26:18,910 --> 01:26:20,410
That's good.

1524
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:27,500
Hold your breath and push even harder.

1525
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:33,460
Stop pushing.

1526
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:35,540
That's good. -It's over know, sweetie.

1527
01:26:46,170 --> 01:26:47,590
Can I see it?

1528
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,210
- What is it? - A little girl.

1529
01:26:57,590 --> 01:27:00,800
We'll just finish up -by removing the placenta.

1530
01:27:01,130 --> 01:27:02,380
Go!

1531
01:27:03,090 --> 01:27:04,130
Please!

1532
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:07,760
Go!

1533
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:10,170
Please, ma'am, we're nearly done.

1534
01:27:11,670 --> 01:27:12,920
Can I have...

1535
01:27:13,090 --> 01:27:15,630
Can I be alone with the...

1536
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:17,920
With the baby?

1537
01:27:18,130 --> 01:27:19,130
You want to see her?

1538
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:20,050
Yeah.

1539
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:31,010
- Are you sure? - I'll put her here.

1540
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:32,640
I want to hold her.

1541
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:45,680
You'll be okay?

1542
01:27:45,850 --> 01:27:47,220
Can you go out?

1543
01:28:00,930 --> 01:28:02,890
I'm sorry.

1544
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:09,600
Can We have the baby?

1545
01:28:14,310 --> 01:28:15,770
Goodbye.

1546
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:26,850
Where are you taking her?

1547
01:28:27,020 --> 01:28:30,690
A room down the hall. -In a cold room to run some tests.

1548
01:28:30,850 --> 01:28:34,310
We'll do DNA tests -to help find the man who raped you.

1549
01:28:36,730 --> 01:28:39,360
She'll stay in the cold room after?

1550
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:41,770
A day or two at most.

1551
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:44,650
And then she'll be put in a...

1552
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:45,940
In a grave?

1553
01:28:46,110 --> 01:28:48,070
Yes, she'll be buried.

1554
01:28:48,230 --> 01:28:49,650
With other babies.

1555
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:50,690
Okay.

1556
01:28:52,110 --> 01:28:54,230
In the same thing as other babies?

1557
01:28:54,820 --> 01:28:56,650
She won't have a...

1558
01:28:56,820 --> 01:28:58,150
A thing of her own?

1559
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:02,690
We take photos to keep in the file.

1560
01:29:13,820 --> 01:29:15,860
The police officers want to see you.

1561
01:29:16,030 --> 01:29:18,530
They have a few questions for you.

1562
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:20,450
Can't it wait?

1563
01:29:20,610 --> 01:29:21,320
No, it can't.

1564
01:29:21,490 --> 01:29:23,910
We have to take the baby -and it needs a name.

1565
01:29:24,110 --> 01:29:27,240
By law, the baby must have a name.

1566
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:30,200
For the registry. To declare the death.

1567
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:31,990
I don't want to...

1568
01:29:32,620 --> 01:29:34,530
have to think of a name.

1569
01:29:34,740 --> 01:29:36,660
It's important for you to...

1570
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:40,990
give her a name. -It's a way for you to find closure.

1571
01:29:42,330 --> 01:29:43,700
It'll stay with me forever.

1572
01:29:43,870 --> 01:29:46,780
This baby is half of you.

1573
01:29:46,910 --> 01:29:48,540
She's your blood.

1574
01:29:49,450 --> 01:29:50,740
You have to name her.

1575
01:29:51,370 --> 01:29:53,790
My rapist's blood, too. I can't.

1576
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:55,370
A name you don't like then.

1577
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:00,200
I was raped. It'll never...

1578
01:30:00,370 --> 01:30:03,830
I'm tired. -I'd like to be left alone.

1579
01:30:11,660 --> 01:30:13,160
I want you to leave.

1580
01:30:13,710 --> 01:30:16,040
You'll have to give her a name.

1581
01:30:21,670 --> 01:30:22,920
Go ahead.

1582
01:30:23,790 --> 01:30:24,830
Iris.

1583
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:28,040
Iris, what's wrong with you?

1584
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:44,670
See you, Laurence.

1585
01:30:45,670 --> 01:30:46,920
See you soon.

1586
01:30:55,170 --> 01:30:57,050
I hope I can do it.

1587
01:30:58,800 --> 01:30:59,590
One...

1588
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:00,550
Two...

1589
01:31:01,550 --> 01:31:02,170
Three!

1590
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:06,380
Cut it out. -Save that shit for Sue Ellen!

1591
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:19,090
To Nadine!

1592
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:20,840
Come on!

1593
01:31:21,050 --> 01:31:22,890
- Sue Ellen, with me. - Sure.

1594
01:31:23,140 --> 01:31:24,640
No way!

1595
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:26,260
A total brush off!

1596
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:28,220
I don't get it.

1597
01:31:28,340 --> 01:31:31,640
How come we're not groovin' -on my birthday?

1598
01:32:17,730 --> 01:32:19,150
Don't you realize?

1599
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:23,020
Why do you do it?

1600
01:32:24,770 --> 01:32:26,770
He said he'd block my access.

1601
01:32:28,060 --> 01:32:29,440
Don't you see?

1602
01:32:29,650 --> 01:32:32,690
One tiny threat and you strip off.

1603
01:32:33,690 --> 01:32:34,610
You did!

1604
01:32:34,770 --> 01:32:37,980
Send your number -and I'll send sexy photos you'll love.

1605
01:32:38,150 --> 01:32:40,940
If you want to see more, -leave me a message.

1606
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:43,150
You know what I think?

1607
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:47,230
I think you're a nympho -who likes banging 4 guys in a garage.

1608
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:48,530
Reading your blog,

1609
01:32:48,690 --> 01:32:51,230
you come across -as a 14-year-old whore!

1610
01:32:51,490 --> 01:32:52,900
He hit you outside?

1611
01:32:54,070 --> 01:32:54,940
That's right.

1612
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:56,940
He hit you outside... I see.

1613
01:32:57,110 --> 01:33:00,360
What did your parents say -when you got home?

1614
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:02,940
I said I fell and they bought it.

1615
01:33:03,450 --> 01:33:05,490
So, you lie to them when needs be.

1616
01:33:05,610 --> 01:33:09,320
And in this instance... -you needed to.

1617
01:33:09,570 --> 01:33:12,240
It's all about dignity. -Your dignity.

1618
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:17,490
You understand what the word means? -You understand the difference...

1619
01:33:18,410 --> 01:33:20,910
between what you can do and...

1620
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:22,780
Do you?

1621
01:33:23,950 --> 01:33:26,490
You have just seen your first "rave".

1622
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:30,370
It's neither rape nor love. -It's a rave.

1623
01:33:30,780 --> 01:33:33,490
We also have rarests. Rustody.

1624
01:33:33,870 --> 01:33:36,200
- Victims... - I think I get the picture.

1625
01:33:36,370 --> 01:33:39,660
It's not that complicated, -putting an R in front.

1626
01:33:39,870 --> 01:33:41,370
The boy's a genius!

1627
01:33:42,370 --> 01:33:43,490
Back in the day,

1628
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:46,500
you waited for marriage, -had sex when you were 20,

1629
01:33:46,660 --> 01:33:48,080
but life's changed now.

1630
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:50,750
The old days are gone, -Louis XIV and all!

1631
01:33:50,870 --> 01:33:52,290
Life is this now.

1632
01:33:52,830 --> 01:33:55,620
Aged 14, -you fuck, you suck, you live!

1633
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:59,410
Watch some TV, -try to get with it, get an update.

1634
01:33:59,830 --> 01:34:02,750
Why did Beauchard start yelling?

1635
01:34:03,540 --> 01:34:05,540
He says we're idealists.

1636
01:34:07,580 --> 01:34:09,500
Hi there! -You just walk on by.

1637
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:10,870
Hi, Melissa.

1638
01:34:18,130 --> 01:34:19,290
I'll be getting back.

1639
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:23,170
I gotta go,

1640
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:24,210
You have 5?

1641
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:25,670
I gotta get home.

1642
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:27,540
Not even 5 minutes?

1643
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:29,090
I have to go, Fred.

1644
01:34:29,210 --> 01:34:30,920
You don't have 5 minutes?

1645
01:34:32,380 --> 01:34:34,210
Still no wedding band?

1646
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:36,340
- No, why? - Come on then.

1647
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:40,710
Okay, a treat for the lady.

1648
01:34:41,090 --> 01:34:42,250
Here We go!

1649
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:43,840
Stop giggling.

1650
01:35:11,590 --> 01:35:12,640
Jeez...

1651
01:35:13,510 --> 01:35:15,090
Happiness really suits you.

1652
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:38,930
Shit's gonna hit the fan again.

1653
01:35:43,770 --> 01:35:44,770
Pack and go!

1654
01:35:45,350 --> 01:35:46,430
It's for lawyers now.

1655
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:49,430
- Can't we talk? - Lawyers.

1656
01:35:51,770 --> 01:35:52,770
You think it's easy?

1657
01:35:52,930 --> 01:35:54,060
Lawyers.

1658
01:35:54,890 --> 01:35:56,560
For the kid, you'll say...

1659
01:35:56,690 --> 01:35:57,600
Lawyers.

1660
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:00,810
You and your daughter get on?

1661
01:36:01,060 --> 01:36:02,980
Fine. She's a good girl.

1662
01:36:03,140 --> 01:36:06,600
The question is, -do you get on with your daughter?

1663
01:36:06,770 --> 01:36:10,100
Do you have a good relationship? -Are you close?

1664
01:36:10,230 --> 01:36:13,190
If she had problems, -could she talk to you freely?

1665
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:14,610
Of course.

1666
01:36:15,190 --> 01:36:16,360
No problem.

1667
01:36:17,730 --> 01:36:20,730
You know you're here for child abuse?

1668
01:36:23,110 --> 01:36:25,070
Off the record,

1669
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:29,020
she said you plan to marry her off -to a cousin back home.

1670
01:36:29,190 --> 01:36:31,900
That's right. I'm her dad. -She has to marry one day.

1671
01:36:32,070 --> 01:36:33,940
You think you do what you want?

1672
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:35,280
I'm in charge.

1673
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:38,190
You did your research -before you came in.

1674
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:39,400
That's in no law.

1675
01:36:39,610 --> 01:36:41,360
Know what's gonna happen?

1676
01:36:41,490 --> 01:36:44,490
After your girl's married -and been raped by her husband.

1677
01:36:44,650 --> 01:36:48,360
Because it's rape. -You force her into non-consensual sex.

1678
01:36:48,530 --> 01:36:50,320
And I'll be there that day.

1679
01:36:50,700 --> 01:36:51,900
What's your problem?

1680
01:36:52,780 --> 01:36:55,280
I say if there's a problem. -This is the police.

1681
01:36:55,450 --> 01:36:57,110
I refuse to talk to you.

1682
01:36:57,320 --> 01:36:58,610
- There's only me. - Get the boss.

1683
01:36:58,820 --> 01:37:00,320
Hold on a second.

1684
01:37:00,950 --> 01:37:02,950
I'm the police, okay?

1685
01:37:05,450 --> 01:37:06,950
Look! I am the police.

1686
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:09,200
I ask the questions, -you answer them.

1687
01:37:09,570 --> 01:37:11,950
Why won't you talk to me? -'Cos I'm a woman?

1688
01:37:12,740 --> 01:37:13,780
Shame on you.

1689
01:37:14,030 --> 01:37:16,780
Go home -and look after your husband and kids.

1690
01:37:16,950 --> 01:37:19,280
Shame on me?

1691
01:37:19,410 --> 01:37:20,990
Don't talk to me like that!

1692
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:22,200
Respect, okay?

1693
01:37:22,370 --> 01:37:24,830
You're sure you read the Qur'an? -Prove it.

1694
01:37:25,030 --> 01:37:26,580
Tell me,

1695
01:37:27,410 --> 01:37:30,290
if you're a man and a good Muslim,

1696
01:37:30,410 --> 01:37:33,240
tell me just where it says

1697
01:37:33,450 --> 01:37:37,080
a father -can force his daughter to marry.

1698
01:37:37,620 --> 01:37:38,160
Show me.

1699
01:37:38,620 --> 01:37:43,540
You think you can teach me the Qur'an?

1700
01:37:43,830 --> 01:37:47,580
Where does it say -a woman isn't allowed to work?

1701
01:37:47,790 --> 01:37:49,710
Show me! -Call yourself Muslim?

1702
01:37:49,830 --> 01:37:51,330
You taint us.

1703
01:37:51,580 --> 01:37:54,000
The Qur'an teaches respect. Got it?

1704
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:56,460
- Is there a problem here? - No, no problem.

1705
01:37:56,920 --> 01:37:58,330
There is no problem!

1706
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:00,540
- You want something to drink? - Water!

1707
01:38:05,330 --> 01:38:06,330
Mehdi.

1708
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:12,330
My father.

1709
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:17,130
Is it couscous?

1710
01:38:17,290 --> 01:38:18,340
A tagine.

1711
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:21,710
Child Protection -covers lots of things like vice

1712
01:38:22,210 --> 01:38:23,550
and narcotics, no?

1713
01:38:25,130 --> 01:38:27,050
Minors get caught up in drugs.

1714
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:31,130
Sure, but we mostly handle -vice-related cases.

1715
01:38:31,750 --> 01:38:32,840
He arrests pedophiles.

1716
01:38:33,010 --> 01:38:34,710
Not only pedophiles.

1717
01:38:35,420 --> 01:38:37,170
That can't always be easy.

1718
01:38:37,340 --> 01:38:39,130
Isn't it tough, constant insults?

1719
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:40,130
No. Thanks.

1720
01:38:40,300 --> 01:38:41,550
People hate the cops.

1721
01:38:42,010 --> 01:38:44,130
They're never there when you need them.

1722
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:47,380
Okay...

1723
01:38:48,380 --> 01:38:49,930
What do you dial for the police?

1724
01:38:50,130 --> 01:38:52,260
- 12, isn't it? - No, it's 17.

1725
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:53,470
Is it really 17?

1726
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:55,890
What's Melissa like day to day?

1727
01:38:56,050 --> 01:38:59,390
It's not easy for me to talk

1728
01:38:59,590 --> 01:39:01,010
about Melissa with her dad.

1729
01:39:03,050 --> 01:39:06,850
And it's not easy to talk -about someone sitting next to you.

1730
01:39:07,510 --> 01:39:08,180
Granddad...

1731
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:10,220
Do you like my new love?

1732
01:39:10,510 --> 01:39:11,550
Sure.

1733
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:13,600
Do you like him?

1734
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:15,970
Whatever you like, I like.

1735
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:25,760
Feels great, giving you stuff.

1736
01:39:25,930 --> 01:39:28,100
Are you pleased or laughing at me?

1737
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:31,270
It's so ugly!

1738
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:14,020
I was sending a text or something.

1739
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:15,940
I had my phone in my hand.

1740
01:40:17,650 --> 01:40:21,360
And this girl comes over, -like, let me see that.

1741
01:40:21,570 --> 01:40:23,650
So I show her and she takes it,

1742
01:40:24,940 --> 01:40:25,940
and I'm like...

1743
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:28,900
Can you get to the...

1744
01:40:29,030 --> 01:40:31,150
When you met the boys.

1745
01:40:31,650 --> 01:40:33,190
That's what I'm telling you.

1746
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:37,200
So the girl's taken your phone -and you say...

1747
01:40:37,570 --> 01:40:41,280
They've got your phone. -After that, what happened?

1748
01:40:41,450 --> 01:40:42,530
I ask for it back.

1749
01:40:43,150 --> 01:40:46,360
She's like, -sure, if you give my friends head.

1750
01:40:46,610 --> 01:40:48,160
I'm like, okay.

1751
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:49,860
Okay to what?

1752
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:53,070
To blowing them for my phone.

1753
01:40:57,200 --> 01:41:00,070
You really liked your phone.

1754
01:41:00,780 --> 01:41:01,950
No kidding.

1755
01:41:06,450 --> 01:41:07,780
And for a laptop?

1756
01:41:11,660 --> 01:41:12,700
Sorry, slipped out.

1757
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:15,290
Take no notice.

1758
01:41:15,450 --> 01:41:16,870
It's not you...

1759
01:41:19,950 --> 01:41:22,790
We can't do this with those two... -Stop it!

1760
01:41:22,990 --> 01:41:24,580
Sorry, don't mind us.

1761
01:41:25,450 --> 01:41:26,660
In the police,

1762
01:41:26,910 --> 01:41:29,250
we're not usually like this.

1763
01:41:29,620 --> 01:41:32,370
You don't give head for a phone. -You realize that?

1764
01:41:32,540 --> 01:41:34,160
It was a smartphone.

1765
01:41:45,290 --> 01:41:46,290
Sorry.

1766
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:48,920
Sit down and let's finish up here.

1767
01:41:51,630 --> 01:41:53,500
You followed the whole group.

1768
01:41:58,630 --> 01:42:00,750
I need 20 volunteers for a special op.

1769
01:42:01,250 --> 01:42:03,380
- What kind? - That's all I have.

1770
01:42:03,710 --> 01:42:05,460
We'll go next door.

1771
01:42:05,590 --> 01:42:06,630
This is chaos!

1772
01:42:10,590 --> 01:42:12,670
Check it out. You never know.

1773
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:14,800
Go with them and fill me in later.

1774
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:18,380
Where were we?

1775
01:42:19,250 --> 01:42:21,960
We can talk seriously now, Caroline...

1776
01:42:22,260 --> 01:42:24,170
I've lost my phone.

1777
01:42:27,340 --> 01:42:28,630
An informer says

1778
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:31,050
the Emeralds -will hand the Beggars stolen jewels

1779
01:42:31,220 --> 01:42:32,720
worth 1 million euros.

1780
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:36,510
The drop's tomorrow at 2 p.m., -at Domus mall.

1781
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:38,840
All we know is they'll come by car,

1782
01:42:39,090 --> 01:42:41,550
most likely with wives and kids. -And armed.

1783
01:42:42,220 --> 01:42:43,760
Which one's Chrys's hubby?

1784
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:46,430
Black shirt by the cabinet.

1785
01:42:46,590 --> 01:42:47,510
Over there?

1786
01:42:48,300 --> 01:42:51,260
We'll tail them, -let the drop take place...

1787
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:52,470
Not what I imagined.

1788
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:54,510
We follow them to their cars

1789
01:42:54,680 --> 01:42:58,470
and we arrest them -only when they're inside the vehicles.

1790
01:42:58,970 --> 01:43:02,680
Look at the photos. -You'll get a list of car plate numbers.

1791
01:43:02,850 --> 01:43:03,890
As for the CPU,

1792
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:06,970
I'll be honest, -you're extras tomorrow.

1793
01:43:23,140 --> 01:43:24,600
Everybody in position?

1794
01:43:25,390 --> 01:43:27,230
Okay, Alex. Standing by.

1795
01:43:27,390 --> 01:43:29,390
Martin in position in the garage.

1796
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:30,640
Copy that.

1797
01:43:39,650 --> 01:43:40,650
Hey, kids!

1798
01:43:42,270 --> 01:43:43,730
We're on a mission.

1799
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:47,690
<i>Beggars in view on the escalator, -Eastern Gate.</i>

1800
01:43:47,810 --> 01:43:50,110
I repeat, at the Eastern Gate.

1801
01:43:57,770 --> 01:44:00,020
Nadine, CPU. -They just passed the desk.

1802
01:44:02,860 --> 01:44:05,190
Gabriel, CPU. -Beggars right in front of me.

1803
01:44:07,610 --> 01:44:10,110
<i>They're looking all over, on-edge.</i>

1804
01:44:15,070 --> 01:44:17,360
Iris. -They just passed by me.

1805
01:44:17,780 --> 01:44:19,990
We have them on visual. Stay in position.

1806
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:29,150
<i>Emeralds arriving, -opposite direction.</i>

1807
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:32,610
The drop's imminent.

1808
01:44:32,740 --> 01:44:33,860
<i>Stay alert.</i>

1809
01:44:35,110 --> 01:44:36,860
<i>Meeting outside the bed store.</i>

1810
01:44:37,070 --> 01:44:38,990
<i>Outside the bed store.</i>

1811
01:44:42,410 --> 01:44:43,160
What's up?

1812
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:44,490
This is it.

1813
01:44:45,370 --> 01:44:47,530
Stay calm, act natural.

1814
01:44:47,700 --> 01:44:48,990
It's them.

1815
01:44:50,910 --> 01:44:52,240
Be discreet.

1816
01:45:01,620 --> 01:45:02,370
Discreet.

1817
01:45:10,370 --> 01:45:11,290
Be discreet, please.

1818
01:45:24,370 --> 01:45:26,210
Put it away.

1819
01:45:42,250 --> 01:45:43,250
Hands UP!

1820
01:45:46,210 --> 01:45:47,290
Get down!

1821
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:49,330
Everybody on the floor!

1822
01:45:58,500 --> 01:46:00,590
Take it easy! Calm down.

1823
01:46:02,380 --> 01:46:03,840
Back off!

1824
01:46:06,260 --> 01:46:07,130
Hands behind you!

1825
01:46:07,420 --> 01:46:08,760
The cuffs!

1826
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:12,670
We'll take over!

1827
01:46:14,260 --> 01:46:16,380
Fucking CPU! -What the hell happened?

1828
01:46:16,970 --> 01:46:17,840
Back off, I said.

1829
01:46:18,010 --> 01:46:19,260
We're everywhere.

1830
01:46:19,420 --> 01:46:20,090
Shut it!

1831
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:21,630
Put your gun away!

1832
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:26,010
Stop!

1833
01:46:26,180 --> 01:46:27,720
Where you gonna go?

1834
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:28,800
Shut it!

1835
01:46:29,010 --> 01:46:30,430
Back up!

1836
01:46:33,630 --> 01:46:35,050
Stay there!

1837
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:37,390
There are cops everywhere.

1838
01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:39,390
Back up, asshole!

1839
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:41,930
He's your son!

1840
01:46:42,090 --> 01:46:43,760
I don't give a shit!

1841
01:46:44,680 --> 01:46:46,140
He's not my kid!

1842
01:46:46,350 --> 01:46:48,510
He's a kid, that's what counts!

1843
01:46:48,850 --> 01:46:50,310
Where are you going?

1844
01:46:54,010 --> 01:46:54,600
Stop there!

1845
01:46:54,810 --> 01:46:55,390
Sir!

1846
01:46:57,220 --> 01:46:58,100
Don't move!

1847
01:47:07,270 --> 01:47:08,480
Don't touch it!

1848
01:47:09,060 --> 01:47:09,930
My arm's numb.

1849
01:47:10,770 --> 01:47:13,770
Even with a vest, -I still fucking get shot!

1850
01:47:14,770 --> 01:47:15,980
That really is dumb.

1851
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:17,890
It's okay, you're not dead.

1852
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:19,520
You're not dead.

1853
01:47:23,730 --> 01:47:26,850
- Couldn't even be an extra. - We are the extras.

1854
01:47:27,060 --> 01:47:30,350
Don't worry, We did a great job.

1855
01:47:31,190 --> 01:47:31,940
It's okay.

1856
01:47:32,100 --> 01:47:33,310
Don't look at it.

1857
01:47:39,190 --> 01:47:40,270
Sign here.

1858
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:47,360
What?

1859
01:47:47,730 --> 01:47:48,650
What?

1860
01:47:51,070 --> 01:47:52,070
Chrys!

1861
01:47:52,230 --> 01:47:53,400
Don't run!

1862
01:48:11,490 --> 01:48:13,030
Can you hear us, kid?

1863
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:20,450
What?

1864
01:48:23,070 --> 01:48:23,990
He wants Pepitos.

1865
01:48:24,070 --> 01:48:25,280
- What? - Pepitos.

1866
01:48:25,490 --> 01:48:26,160
<i>I'll go.</i>

1867
01:48:26,320 --> 01:48:28,030
You'll get the wrong ones.

1868
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:29,490
I'll take it with.

1869
01:48:35,820 --> 01:48:37,490
You okay, fella?

1870
01:48:37,820 --> 01:48:38,910
Does it hurt?

1871
01:48:40,370 --> 01:48:41,870
You were starving.

1872
01:48:44,910 --> 01:48:46,830
Don't they feed you here?

1873
01:48:47,660 --> 01:48:49,700
He makes such a mess when he eats.

1874
01:49:06,750 --> 01:49:09,290
I'm going for a smoke. -I'll be back in 5.

1875
01:49:33,420 --> 01:49:35,290
You love me a bit, don't you?

1876
01:50:04,720 --> 01:50:06,720
<i>2 wives, so you're polygamous?</i>

1877
01:50:07,050 --> 01:50:08,260
- No. - What do you mean?

1878
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:11,340
Polygamy means several wives.

1879
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:14,430
So you'd say you are...

1880
01:50:14,590 --> 01:50:15,300
A bigamist.

1881
01:50:15,430 --> 01:50:16,590
Bigamist, okay.

1882
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:19,010
What's your sex-life with your wives?

1883
01:50:19,550 --> 01:50:21,430
I'm a romantic.

1884
01:50:21,970 --> 01:50:23,130
I like fellatio.

1885
01:50:23,300 --> 01:50:24,340
Do you?

1886
01:50:25,340 --> 01:50:26,550
Fellatio!

1887
01:50:26,720 --> 01:50:27,800
What's that?

1888
01:50:30,220 --> 01:50:31,550
Shit, I'll start a fire.

1889
01:50:31,720 --> 01:50:33,640
Keep it down. I'm working.

1890
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:35,800
Jesus!

1891
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:39,550
So, fellatio, -you've never heard of it?

1892
01:50:39,680 --> 01:50:40,680
Okay, fine.

1893
01:50:40,850 --> 01:50:43,220
That's it for today. -I'll talk to your daughter

1894
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:46,760
and be in touch. -I'll see you out.

1895
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:55,980
You okay? Not too tired?

1896
01:50:58,680 --> 01:51:00,140
No, I'm fine.

1897
01:51:00,270 --> 01:51:01,180
And you?

1898
01:51:01,350 --> 01:51:03,600
You think I don't see you on Facebook?

1899
01:51:03,810 --> 01:51:04,850
$0?

1900
01:51:05,690 --> 01:51:07,140
Don't we have work to do?

1901
01:51:07,270 --> 01:51:08,350
You're my boss?

1902
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:10,230
Do I report to you?

1903
01:51:10,850 --> 01:51:13,980
I'd no idea you're my boss!

1904
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:17,400
I can discuss work. -Aren't we a team?

1905
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:18,770
Okay, let's talk work.

1906
01:51:18,980 --> 01:51:22,190
I just saw the split vagina -of an 11-month-old baby,

1907
01:51:22,350 --> 01:51:23,900
then I saw her mother,

1908
01:51:24,150 --> 01:51:27,360
who's suicidal because -her girl's been raped for months.

1909
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:29,560
Sure, let's talk work.

1910
01:51:29,730 --> 01:51:32,310
I'm a good cop and I do a good job

1911
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:34,230
even if I'm not like you.

1912
01:51:34,360 --> 01:51:36,400
Let me chill -with my virtual friends

1913
01:51:36,570 --> 01:51:38,730
before I move onto my next case.

1914
01:51:38,980 --> 01:51:40,440
Get off my back!

1915
01:51:40,650 --> 01:51:41,820
The lady speaks.

1916
01:51:42,690 --> 01:51:45,150
Something's bugging the lady.

1917
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:49,860
Get off my case, Iris! -This is not the time.

1918
01:51:50,690 --> 01:51:51,730
It never is.

1919
01:51:51,900 --> 01:51:53,730
It's always the time to chat.

1920
01:51:54,110 --> 01:51:55,610
Shut your big mouth.

1921
01:51:55,990 --> 01:51:57,490
Just shut the fuck up!

1922
01:51:57,990 --> 01:51:59,030
Got that?

1923
01:52:00,740 --> 01:52:01,530
Shut it.

1924
01:52:01,700 --> 01:52:04,570
You get all the tough cases, -I get all the "raves"?

1925
01:52:04,780 --> 01:52:06,240
Cut it out, Iris.

1926
01:52:06,610 --> 01:52:09,490
We're partners. -We can discuss our work.

1927
01:52:09,650 --> 01:52:10,820
We're partners?

1928
01:52:11,030 --> 01:52:13,610
Partners communicate with each other.

1929
01:52:13,860 --> 01:52:15,320
Where's the communication?

1930
01:52:15,450 --> 01:52:17,820
You tell me what to do -and what not to do.

1931
01:52:18,030 --> 01:52:20,570
What I can do, what I can't do.

1932
01:52:20,740 --> 01:52:22,870
You grade me, you judge me...

1933
01:52:23,570 --> 01:52:25,370
Just get the fuck off my back

1934
01:52:25,570 --> 01:52:27,120
and stop lecturing me!

1935
01:52:30,120 --> 01:52:33,490
That's the thanks I get -for listening to your troubles

1936
01:52:33,660 --> 01:52:36,490
and your little hassles with hubby.

1937
01:52:36,950 --> 01:52:38,990
But this is about work.

1938
01:52:39,200 --> 01:52:43,200
You're way off, Nadine, that's all. -I'm just saying.

1939
01:52:43,660 --> 01:52:46,580
You have no right to talk about my man.

1940
01:52:46,740 --> 01:52:48,740
Because of you, I left my husband,

1941
01:52:48,950 --> 01:52:50,910
when I was partly to blame, too.

1942
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:54,250
Just because you think -men are all shits.

1943
01:52:54,370 --> 01:52:55,660
You can't give any love.

1944
01:52:55,870 --> 01:52:58,120
I'm ashamed I listened to you.

1945
01:52:58,250 --> 01:53:02,160
I miss my family. -I miss my children. Can't you see that?

1946
01:53:02,330 --> 01:53:06,170
It's because of her, -making me see him like a...

1947
01:53:06,330 --> 01:53:07,000
I love him.

1948
01:53:07,170 --> 01:53:10,210
Maybe that pisses you off -because you love no one.

1949
01:53:10,420 --> 01:53:13,960
You're all shriveled up. -No cock could ever get inside you!

1950
01:53:14,290 --> 01:53:15,620
You're a piece of shit!

1951
01:53:15,790 --> 01:53:18,460
You don't seem -in control of your faculties.

1952
01:53:18,630 --> 01:53:20,710
Don't fucking start on that.

1953
01:53:20,830 --> 01:53:24,840
Just don't start telling me what to do.

1954
01:53:26,540 --> 01:53:29,840
Your husband's gone. -He should've gone long ago!

1955
01:53:30,040 --> 01:53:32,840
I feel sorry for him. -All these years with you.

1956
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:34,420
And you making yourself puke?

1957
01:53:34,590 --> 01:53:38,460
You think nobody knows? -We all know, you puke all day long.

1958
01:53:41,750 --> 01:53:44,670
It's over, got it? Over!

1959
01:53:44,840 --> 01:53:46,670
Stop trying to run my life!

1960
01:53:46,840 --> 01:53:47,840
I'll file a report.

1961
01:53:48,010 --> 01:53:49,590
What do you expect?

1962
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:50,670
Want me to type it?

1963
01:53:56,760 --> 01:53:58,840
What the hell's going on?

1964
01:53:59,880 --> 01:54:01,590
We can hear you downstairs!

1965
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:02,760
I don't care!

1966
01:54:02,930 --> 01:54:05,800
What's the problem? -Sounds like ego issues.

1967
01:54:06,010 --> 01:54:08,050
Sure, the ego is dignity.

1968
01:54:08,220 --> 01:54:12,050
You've got no ego? Ego means -I can look at myself in the mirror.

1969
01:54:12,220 --> 01:54:14,340
I leave my ego problems at home.

1970
01:54:14,470 --> 01:54:16,510
Not ego problems, one ego problem!

1971
01:54:16,720 --> 01:54:18,800
Be quiet when I'm talking!

1972
01:54:18,930 --> 01:54:19,720
Shut up now.

1973
01:54:19,890 --> 01:54:22,970
We'll split you up in September.

1974
01:54:25,350 --> 01:54:26,390
For now, button it!

1975
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:28,930
Don't talk to me like I'm stupid.

1976
01:54:29,430 --> 01:54:31,510
I don't give a shit! -l can leave!

1977
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:32,430
Leave.

1978
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:34,600
Do us all a favor!

1979
01:55:04,690 --> 01:55:06,650
Start with a piked somersault.

1980
01:55:06,810 --> 01:55:07,940
Let's go.

1981
01:55:12,150 --> 01:55:15,520
Reach for the mat. -That's why you fell.

1982
01:55:15,690 --> 01:55:16,810
Next!

1983
01:55:21,150 --> 01:55:23,900
Nice but concentrate on keeping it tight,

1984
01:55:24,110 --> 01:55:25,480
to finish it off.

1985
01:55:25,610 --> 01:55:27,020
Let's keep going.

1986
01:55:31,320 --> 01:55:32,480
Very nice.

1987
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:35,610
Solal, your turn.

1988
01:55:36,570 --> 01:55:37,980
Come on, Solal.

1989
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:41,360
What are you waiting for?

1990
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:46,530
Leave him, it's okay.

1991
01:55:46,650 --> 01:55:48,610
If you're nervous, don't jump.

1992
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:49,900
Keep it coming.

1993
01:55:52,820 --> 01:55:54,490
Limited, but nicely done.

1994
01:55:54,700 --> 01:55:55,450
Who's next?

1995
01:55:58,240 --> 01:56:00,950
Good. That's called a tuck jump.

1996
01:56:08,110 --> 01:56:09,200
Solal?

1997
01:57:52,010 --> 01:57:53,430
I'm really so sorry.

1998
01:57:57,050 --> 01:58:00,510
I'd like to apologize to him. -I hope he gets over it.

1999
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:02,760
I never wanted to hurt him.

2000
01:58:02,930 --> 01:58:05,050
You realize now that you did?

2001
01:58:05,180 --> 01:58:05,720
Yes.

2002
01:58:05,930 --> 01:58:08,600
You didn't think about it then, but now?

2003
01:58:09,180 --> 01:58:10,300
We had a relationship

2004
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:12,680
that was like love.

2005
01:58:19,470 --> 01:58:23,140
I need you to sign the statement, -the bottom of each page.

2006
01:58:29,970 --> 01:58:31,560
Where'll he go now?

2007
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:33,020
Will he be okay?

2008
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:36,680
He'll receive help. -He'll be well looked after.

2009
01:58:37,100 --> 01:58:40,730
I know other places -where he can still do gymnastics.

2010
01:58:41,060 --> 01:58:42,690
It's important for him.

2011
01:58:44,810 --> 01:58:46,310
Will he

2012
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:48,600
go to jail because of me?

2013
01:58:49,190 --> 01:58:50,140
No.

2014
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:52,650
He'll go to jail for What he did.

2015
01:58:52,850 --> 01:58:55,850
He did it to you, -but you're not to blame. He's sick.

2016
01:58:56,150 --> 01:59:00,190
Your teacher has a disease, you see, -called pedophilia.

2017
01:59:00,440 --> 01:59:02,230
He's called a pedophile.

2018
01:59:02,610 --> 01:59:05,480
Have you heard that word before? -At school maybe?

2019
01:59:05,690 --> 01:59:08,610
It's a disease some adults have,

2020
01:59:08,770 --> 01:59:12,440
which means -that they do things to children

2021
01:59:12,610 --> 01:59:14,150
they have no right to do.

2022
01:59:14,650 --> 01:59:17,610
We're here to catch and punish them.

2023
01:59:19,690 --> 01:59:21,650
Why isn't he...

2024
01:59:21,780 --> 01:59:25,400
Why's he going to prison and not just...

2025
01:59:26,570 --> 01:59:29,530
Why isn't he going to a hospital?

2026
01:59:30,110 --> 01:59:33,990
When someone breaks the law like that,

2027
01:59:34,150 --> 01:59:35,610
they go to prison.

2028
01:59:36,150 --> 01:59:38,900
It's a punishment -that serves a purpose.

2029
01:59:39,530 --> 01:59:43,150
Then, maybe he'll be able -to do gym again one day,

2030
01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:45,700
and not hurt any more children, -you see?

2031
01:59:47,410 --> 01:59:48,990
I feel a bit sad.

2032
01:59:49,450 --> 01:59:50,780
Why are you sad?

2033
01:59:53,660 --> 01:59:55,490
I liked him.

2034
01:59:56,120 --> 01:59:58,240
He was nice to me.

2035
02:01:16,630 --> 02:01:17,840
Morning, everybody.

2036
02:01:19,210 --> 02:01:20,710
What a reception!

2037
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:23,840
Nice to hear you speak as one.

2038
02:01:24,590 --> 02:01:26,340
I hope you enjoyed the vacation.

2039
02:01:26,670 --> 02:01:30,510
I see some people -have been in the sun, and others...

2040
02:01:31,050 --> 02:01:32,220
less so.

2041
02:01:33,340 --> 02:01:35,970
I hope school started okay -for your kids...

2042
02:01:45,510 --> 02:01:49,090
I'll start with the new appointments

2043
02:01:49,260 --> 02:01:50,800
and departures.

2044
02:01:50,970 --> 02:01:55,890
Lt. Desgranges has moved on -to the Vice Squad, as anticipated.

2045
02:01:56,390 --> 02:01:59,510
He'll be replaced by Lt. Géron.

2046
02:02:11,390 --> 02:02:13,970
Capt. Beck has joined the Fraud Squad

2047
02:02:14,680 --> 02:02:19,310
and Lt. Iris Langlois transfers -to replace him as section chief.

2048
02:02:26,890 --> 02:02:27,980
Congratulations.

2049
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:36,350
Now, I'd like to talk about my plans -to restructure,

2050
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:38,640
as everybody expected, -the Internet Section.

2051
02:02:39,900 --> 02:02:44,100
I believe that investing resources there -will help us

2052
02:02:44,270 --> 02:02:46,190
smoke out more pedophiles.

2053
02:02:56,070 --> 02:02:59,070
The pedophile at the school gates -is long gone...

2054
02:02:59,860 --> 02:03:01,570
Can I open a window? I'm hot.

2055
02:03:02,820 --> 02:03:05,320
You make it sound -like fieldwork's bullshit.
