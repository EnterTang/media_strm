1
00:00:01,601 --> 00:00:04,991
Get back! Who are you?

2
00:00:06,081 --> 00:00:08,800
Who are you?

3
00:00:11,201 --> 00:00:14,079
- I'm Willow Ufgood.
- What are you doing here?

4
00:00:14,201 --> 00:00:17,671
I've come to find
the great sorceress Fin Raziel.

5
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:20,235
That's me! I'm Raziel!

6
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:24,032
This can't be right!

7
00:00:24,161 --> 00:00:27,471
One of Bavmorda's spells
transformed me.

8
00:00:29,721 --> 00:00:32,155
Believe me,
it could have been worse!

9
00:00:33,681 --> 00:00:37,799
Well, this wand is for you.
It's from Cherlindrea.

10
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:39,991
Then the prophecy is true.

11
00:00:40,121 --> 00:00:43,477
The princess has been born.
Take me to her.

12
00:00:47,321 --> 00:00:50,438
It is Elora Danan.
Isn't she beautiful?

13
00:00:52,241 --> 00:00:55,039
Isn't she beautiful?

14
00:00:55,161 --> 00:00:57,755
- That's Raziel?
- I don't know.

15
00:00:57,881 --> 00:01:00,634
I expected something
more grand. Less--

16
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:02,638
- Fuzzy.
- Fuzzy.

17
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:06,356
You must use the wand.
Turn me back into my human form.

18
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:09,632
- What do I do?
- You mean you're not a sorcerer?

19
00:01:10,921 --> 00:01:13,230
Yes. Sorta.

20
00:01:13,361 --> 00:01:14,635
I'm a farmer.

21
00:01:15,881 --> 00:01:18,441
- But I do know a few tricks.
- Tricks?

22
00:01:18,561 --> 00:01:22,793
Cherlindrea sent <i>you?</i>
You must learn real magic.

23
00:01:24,641 --> 00:01:26,836
- Horses!
- Horses!

24
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,156
Quick! Take her! Hurry!

25
00:01:37,841 --> 00:01:40,639
I knew he was a traitor!

26
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:45,635
- Sorry about this, peck.
- Keep your mouth shut.

27
00:01:46,881 --> 00:01:49,349
I told you we'd find them
without your help.

28
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:51,358
- Give me that baby!
- No!

29
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:58,475
- Give her back!
- Leave me alone! Don't touch me!

30
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:05,953
This is the one
we're looking for.

31
00:02:06,081 --> 00:02:08,037
We must take it back
to Nockmaar.

32
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:13,798
Lose your skirt?

33
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,519
- I've still got what counts.
- Not for long.

34
00:02:30,921 --> 00:02:33,310
- Bring him.
- Over here!

35
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:53,676
We'll never keep up
with those horses.

36
00:02:54,401 --> 00:02:57,313
- Then we will have to track them.
- That would take forever.

37
00:02:57,441 --> 00:02:59,909
Besides, even if we find them,
they'll catch us...

38
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:03,078
stick us in cages, torture us
and finally devour us.

39
00:03:03,201 --> 00:03:04,998
Are you suggesting we go home?

40
00:03:05,121 --> 00:03:07,760
- Nah. This is more fun.
- All right.

41
00:03:07,881 --> 00:03:09,758
Fine, then.
Come on.

42
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:26,352
I'm worried about Elora.
She doesn't sound good.

43
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:29,075
Hurry! Practise
the chant I taught you!

44
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:32,629
<i>Tanna looatha</i>--

45
00:03:32,761 --> 00:03:34,717
I can't remember
the middle part.

46
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:36,718
<i>Locktwaar!</i>

47
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,719
That's the word
that pleads for change.

48
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:41,718
<i>Locktwaar.</i>

49
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:48,159
Elora's cold and hungry.
She knows me.

50
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:50,112
Please, let me take care of her.

51
00:03:50,241 --> 00:03:52,232
I don't need help from a peck.

52
00:03:56,641 --> 00:03:59,599
- What are you staring at?
- Your leg.

53
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:02,632
I'd like to break it.

54
00:04:02,761 --> 00:04:04,638
You may find that difficult,
slave...

55
00:04:04,761 --> 00:04:06,797
while I'm up here
and you're down there.

56
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:11,917
I hate that woman.

57
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:50,877
I found it, Kael.

58
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:55,550
That should make
my mother happy.

59
00:04:55,681 --> 00:04:57,558
What are they gonna do to her?

60
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:13,115
<i>Hither walha...</i>

61
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:16,551
<i>bairn deru bordak...</i>

62
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:17,955
<i>bellanockt.</i>

63
00:05:19,441 --> 00:05:21,318
That's magic?
Smells terrible.

64
00:05:21,441 --> 00:05:24,478
- It's the life spark. It forms after--
- It stinks!

65
00:05:24,601 --> 00:05:27,593
- This whole thing stinks!
- Ignore him, Willow.

66
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:30,599
- He's a fool!
- If only I had a sword!

67
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:33,632
If only you'd quit
talking about it.

68
00:05:33,761 --> 00:05:36,912
Willow, you must transform me
to my human self.

69
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,714
But, Raziel, I'm not ready yet.

70
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:42,878
You'd better be.
Get me down.

71
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:47,675
Ow!

72
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:54,079
Why don't you help me get out of here
instead of chattering with that muskrat?

73
00:05:54,201 --> 00:05:55,316
Muskrat!

74
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:59,878
When I change back to my former self,
I will crush this army...

75
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:03,277
and take Elora Danan
to Tir Asleen...

76
00:06:03,401 --> 00:06:05,835
where she will be safe.

77
00:06:06,641 --> 00:06:10,077
Ow! What'd you bite me for?

78
00:06:10,201 --> 00:06:13,318
You need three drops of your blood
to put in the potion.

79
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:15,079
You could've warned me.

80
00:06:16,681 --> 00:06:18,956
For beginners,
there's some pain...

81
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:23,916
but don't let anything
break your concentration.

82
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:31,600
<i>Hither greenan bairn</i>
<i>claideb lunanockt.</i>

83
00:06:31,721 --> 00:06:35,236
- Hello, everybody! We have arrived!
- You are saved.

84
00:06:36,241 --> 00:06:38,038
Don't interrupt.

85
00:06:39,481 --> 00:06:42,473
<i>Hither greenan bairn</i>
<i>claideb lunanockt.</i>

86
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:45,272
What will you look like
if this works?

87
00:06:45,401 --> 00:06:47,756
- Don't interrupt.
- Sorry.

88
00:06:47,881 --> 00:06:49,678
<i>Hither greenan bairn</i>
<i>claideb lunanockt.</i>

89
00:06:49,801 --> 00:06:52,918
I am a young, beautiful woman.

90
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,713
Concentrate, Willow.

91
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:56,877
<i>Hither greenan bairn</i>
<i>claideb lunanockt.</i>

92
00:06:59,361 --> 00:07:01,352
You're losing me!

93
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:04,711
<i>Hither greenan bairn</i>
<i>claideb lunanockt.</i>

94
00:07:10,121 --> 00:07:12,237
You all right?
Nice try, Willow.

95
00:07:20,161 --> 00:07:23,870
Farmers!
Cherlindrea sends me farmers!

96
00:07:25,001 --> 00:07:27,310
The Nelwyn
really butchered that one.

97
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:29,193
I'm sorry, Raziel.

98
00:07:29,401 --> 00:07:30,800
You want out?

99
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:33,389
Easy. We can pick a lock.
Come on.

100
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:35,159
No. No, no.
Like this!

101
00:07:35,281 --> 00:07:37,237
I know what I'm doing.
It's my spear. Leave it alone.

102
00:07:37,361 --> 00:07:39,591
Let me do it.

103
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:41,518
Out of the way, rodents.

104
00:07:42,761 --> 00:07:43,830
Take your hand off that.

105
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:48,159
You leave that alone,
you stupid, fat Daikini!

106
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,991
Dust of broken hearts.

107
00:08:03,881 --> 00:08:05,553
You are free!

108
00:08:05,681 --> 00:08:06,750
Come on, Madmartigan.

109
00:08:06,881 --> 00:08:09,076
Let's get Elora Danan
out of here.

110
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:10,953
Yeah.

111
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:13,117
- It'll be fun.
- Come on.

112
00:08:24,961 --> 00:08:26,838
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

113
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:30,312
I feel good.

114
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:32,352
The dust of broken hearts.

115
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:35,274
Come on!

116
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:44,513
- Let me see!
- Let <i>me</i> see. You always see.

117
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:46,950
There's Elora, right there,
on those furs.

118
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:52,677
Hey, wait! Leave this to us.
It's too dangerous for you.

119
00:08:52,801 --> 00:08:56,794
Only one of us should go in there.
I know what I'm doing.

120
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:29,035
Wait. No, no!

121
00:09:39,761 --> 00:09:42,434
- I love you.
- Madmartigan!

122
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:45,359
What are you doing?
Get the baby!

123
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:46,755
Come on!

124
00:10:01,641 --> 00:10:03,597
Wake from this hateful sleep.

125
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:05,951
It deprives me of your beauty.

126
00:10:07,321 --> 00:10:10,597
- The beauty of your eyes--
- One move, jackass...

127
00:10:10,721 --> 00:10:13,440
and you really will be a woman.

128
00:10:13,561 --> 00:10:19,079
You are my sun! My moon!
My starlit sky.

129
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:22,716
Without you, I dwell in darkness.
I love you.

130
00:10:24,201 --> 00:10:25,634
What are you doing here?

131
00:10:25,761 --> 00:10:28,912
Your power has enchanted me.
I stand helpless against it.

132
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,838
Come to me now.

133
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:33,270
Tonight, let me worship you
in my arms.

134
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:35,961
- Get away from me!
- I love you!

135
00:10:36,081 --> 00:10:38,390
Stop saying that!

136
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:42,560
How can I stop the beating of my heart?
It pounds like never before.

137
00:10:42,681 --> 00:10:45,115
- Out of fear.
- Out of love!

138
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:47,596
I can stop it.
I'll kill you.

139
00:10:47,721 --> 00:10:49,677
Death, next to love,
is a trivial thing.

140
00:10:53,201 --> 00:10:55,556
Your touch is worth 1 00,000 deaths.

141
00:11:00,281 --> 00:11:01,760
What goes on here?

142
00:11:06,681 --> 00:11:08,558
Deceiver!

143
00:11:10,121 --> 00:11:11,839
Stop him!

144
00:11:20,481 --> 00:11:22,949
Get me out!

145
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:34,957
You <i>are</i> great!

146
00:11:37,961 --> 00:11:39,553
Get on that shield!

147
00:11:56,201 --> 00:11:58,078
After them!

148
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:12,280
They're getting away!

149
00:12:21,201 --> 00:12:23,271
- Follow me, Rool.
- Where are you?

150
00:12:23,401 --> 00:12:25,039
I don't know.

151
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:27,998
Oh, no!
Where did everybody go?

152
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:29,998
Maybe it was something we said.

153
00:14:05,681 --> 00:14:07,558
What the hell happened up there?

154
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,637
You started spouting poetry.

155
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:12,195
- Poetry?
- Yeah.

156
00:14:12,321 --> 00:14:15,279
''I love you, Sorsha.
I worship you, Sorsha.''

157
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:17,312
You almost got us killed!

158
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:19,193
''I love you, Sorsha''?

159
00:14:19,321 --> 00:14:21,596
I don't love her.
She kicked me in the face.

160
00:14:21,721 --> 00:14:24,155
I hate her! Don't I?

161
00:14:27,121 --> 00:14:29,396
Kael! Kael!

162
00:14:29,521 --> 00:14:31,079
Nockmaar soldiers!

163
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:36,037
Hide! Get the children!
Come on!

164
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,191
- Hide! Get the children!
- They're after us!

165
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:44,791
- We need a place to hide.
- Come on. Follow me. Quick!

166
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:03,320
I knew you'd get out
of that rattrap.

167
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:07,598
You left me to die, Airk.

168
00:15:07,721 --> 00:15:10,793
I probably saved your life.
We were slaughtered, and I lost a lot--

169
00:15:10,921 --> 00:15:11,797
Quiet!

170
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:16,078
Tear this village apart!

171
00:15:16,801 --> 00:15:19,076
Look everywhere!

172
00:15:19,201 --> 00:15:20,350
Find the child!

173
00:15:54,761 --> 00:15:57,594
Tell Sorsha
I search the north bank!

174
00:15:57,721 --> 00:15:58,870
Yes, General.

175
00:16:12,161 --> 00:16:14,072
Quiet!

176
00:16:32,721 --> 00:16:35,554
- Sorsha!
- Back.

177
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,230
Back!

178
00:16:43,721 --> 00:16:44,949
Back.

179
00:16:46,681 --> 00:16:49,559
- Keep the baby quiet.
- She needs to be changed.

180
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:52,113
- Nockmaar scum!
- You'll never defeat us.

181
00:16:52,241 --> 00:16:53,833
- Give up the baby!
- Shut up!

182
00:16:55,841 --> 00:16:59,151
- Why does Bavmorda want this baby?
- She's a princess.

183
00:16:59,281 --> 00:17:01,841
- We're taking her to Tir Asleen.
- Tir Asleen?

184
00:17:01,961 --> 00:17:03,838
Even if you could find it, peck...

185
00:17:03,961 --> 00:17:06,191
she's right-- you'd never
get past the Nockmaar army.

186
00:17:06,321 --> 00:17:09,996
There's an even bigger army
at Tir Asleen, if we can get there.

187
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:17,035
I've lost more than half my men
fighting Bavmorda.

188
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,038
Now you and this peck
are gonna take her on?

189
00:17:20,161 --> 00:17:22,755
You always told me you served
no one, Madmartigan.

190
00:17:22,881 --> 00:17:24,758
Since when are you a crusader?

191
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:28,917
He's not gonna help you, peck.

192
00:17:30,161 --> 00:17:32,311
He's a worthless thief.

193
00:17:33,401 --> 00:17:35,710
I'm not a thief, Airk.

194
00:17:35,841 --> 00:17:37,354
He's not a thief.

195
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:40,830
Are you?

196
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:57,116
I serve the Nelwyn, Airk.

197
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:05,469
- Want to come with us?
- You'll never make it.

198
00:18:07,401 --> 00:18:09,631
Then once again
we say goodbye.

199
00:18:22,481 --> 00:18:25,712
- Over here!
- Sorsha!

200
00:18:25,841 --> 00:18:27,991
Weapons down or she's dead!

201
00:18:42,001 --> 00:18:43,878
Get to your horses!
After them!

202
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:30,556
This way!
This way!

203
00:19:30,681 --> 00:19:33,241
As the crow flies, you fools!

204
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:42,554
- You're holding me too tight!
- I don't want you to get away.

205
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:46,560
Why? Because I'm your sun,
your moon, your starlit sky?

206
00:19:48,841 --> 00:19:50,797
Get your hair out of my face
or I'll chop it off.

207
00:19:54,681 --> 00:19:56,319
Did I really--

208
00:19:56,441 --> 00:19:58,397
Did I really say
those things last night?

209
00:19:58,521 --> 00:20:01,479
- In your tent?
- You said you loved me.

210
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:03,956
- I don't remember that.
- You lied to me!

211
00:20:04,081 --> 00:20:05,196
No, I--

212
00:20:06,441 --> 00:20:08,716
I just wasn't myself last night.

213
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:12,311
I suppose my power enchanted you
and you were helpless against it.

214
00:20:13,601 --> 00:20:15,671
- Sort of.
- Then what?

215
00:20:16,801 --> 00:20:19,952
- It went away.
- Went away?

216
00:20:20,081 --> 00:20:22,879
''I dwell in darkness without you,''
and it went away?

217
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:24,639
Yeah.

218
00:20:45,361 --> 00:20:47,113
Hurry! Kael's coming!

219
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:53,671
Madmartigan, come on! Now!

220
00:21:01,401 --> 00:21:03,119
Madmartigan, come on!

221
00:21:04,921 --> 00:21:07,560
They're coming! Away!

222
00:21:07,681 --> 00:21:08,796
Go on!

223
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,680
Whoa! Whoa!

224
00:21:29,241 --> 00:21:30,674
This way!

225
00:21:36,601 --> 00:21:40,230
Tir Asleen!
At last, Tir Asleen!

226
00:21:50,721 --> 00:21:51,995
Hello?

227
00:21:53,881 --> 00:21:55,360
Hello?

228
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:00,680
Hello?

229
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:05,035
Why did I listen to you, peck?

230
00:22:05,161 --> 00:22:08,471
''Everything will be all right
once we get to Tir Asleen.''

231
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:12,080
The only army around is the one that's
about to ride across this valley...

232
00:22:12,201 --> 00:22:13,953
and wipe us out!

233
00:22:14,081 --> 00:22:16,959
But Cherlindrea said
we'd be safe here.

234
00:22:17,721 --> 00:22:20,633
Safe? Look at these people.

235
00:22:20,761 --> 00:22:24,470
This place is cursed, peck.
It's falling apart. Open your eyes!

236
00:22:24,601 --> 00:22:25,875
And it--

237
00:22:28,161 --> 00:22:30,072
Trolls.

238
00:22:33,001 --> 00:22:34,957
I hate trolls.

239
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,996
This is the work of Bavmorda.

240
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:49,275
Willow? The wand.

241
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:52,598
- Turn me back into my human form.
- Are you sure?

242
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:11,190
Good.

243
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:20,437
Hurry, Willow.
Transform me.

244
00:23:20,561 --> 00:23:23,359
I can't do it.
I'm just not a sorcerer.

245
00:23:23,481 --> 00:23:29,078
But you can be.
Speak and be one with the words.

246
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:32,193
<i>Avalorium greenan...</i>

247
00:23:32,721 --> 00:23:35,474
<i>luatha tye</i>--

248
00:23:35,601 --> 00:23:38,195
Oh, Willow, you're losing me.

249
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:44,471
Madmartigan, Kael's coming!

250
00:23:44,601 --> 00:23:48,719
- Willow, you idiot.
- Raziel?

251
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:52,030
Arm that catapult up there.

252
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:16,350
Good work, Madmartigan.

253
00:24:16,481 --> 00:24:18,073
What happened to you?

254
00:24:18,201 --> 00:24:20,669
Assault!
Sorsha, battering ram!

255
00:24:25,681 --> 00:24:27,080
Cut it down!

256
00:24:38,641 --> 00:24:39,596
Faster!

257
00:24:54,521 --> 00:24:56,716
Forward! Break it down!

258
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:18,870
Again! Again!

259
00:25:23,361 --> 00:25:25,670
Willow, use the wand
on that troll.

260
00:25:27,881 --> 00:25:29,200
<i>Bellalockt!</i>

261
00:25:51,441 --> 00:25:54,751
Break it down! Forward!

262
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:42,316
Get him!

263
00:27:03,281 --> 00:27:04,839
The other side!

264
00:27:18,921 --> 00:27:21,071
Destroy the beast!
Find the baby!

265
00:27:22,121 --> 00:27:23,713
Take that!

266
00:28:55,961 --> 00:28:58,555
Madmartigan, help!

267
00:29:09,441 --> 00:29:11,113
Get him, Madmartigan!

268
00:29:21,001 --> 00:29:22,434
Here.

269
00:29:38,321 --> 00:29:39,549
The baby!

270
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:41,913
Airk's army. Get Kael!

271
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:44,271
Airk's army!

272
00:30:46,681 --> 00:30:48,717
- We are here!
- You are rescued!

273
00:30:48,841 --> 00:30:51,639
- Charge!
- Charge!

274
00:31:07,921 --> 00:31:10,151
No mercy!

275
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:24,833
Elora!

276
00:31:26,081 --> 00:31:27,196
Willow!

277
00:31:33,401 --> 00:31:35,278
- Elora's gone.
- Willow.

278
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:39,279
They've taken her.
There were too many of them.

279
00:31:44,401 --> 00:31:46,278
Can you ride?

280
00:31:49,401 --> 00:31:50,800
Let's ride.

281
00:32:02,761 --> 00:32:04,991
I have the child!

282
00:32:28,481 --> 00:32:30,472
We need towers
and a battering ram!

283
00:32:30,601 --> 00:32:33,559
Break out the tents!
Make camp!

284
00:32:33,681 --> 00:32:35,637
Make camp!

285
00:32:35,761 --> 00:32:37,479
We'll assault at first light.

286
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:52,672
Where's Sorsha?

287
00:32:53,801 --> 00:32:56,474
She has turned against us,
Your Highness.

288
00:33:00,441 --> 00:33:02,750
Turned against me?

289
00:33:06,241 --> 00:33:08,232
Prepare for the ritual!

290
00:33:30,881 --> 00:33:33,076
This is not an army.

291
00:33:36,201 --> 00:33:38,715
Quick. Hide.

292
00:33:43,361 --> 00:33:46,273
Use the shelter chant.
Protect yourself.

293
00:33:46,401 --> 00:33:48,278
- Why?
-Just do it.

294
00:33:53,681 --> 00:33:57,959
- We've come for Elora Danan.
- You dare to challenge me?

295
00:33:58,081 --> 00:34:00,231
You're not warriors.

296
00:34:01,841 --> 00:34:03,115
You're pigs!

297
00:34:18,361 --> 00:34:20,079
You're all pigs!

298
00:34:22,001 --> 00:34:23,150
Pigs!

299
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:32,199
<i>Avaggdu luatha bairn</i>
<i>off haefermore.</i>

300
00:34:40,681 --> 00:34:42,751
Sorsha!

301
00:34:43,841 --> 00:34:45,194
Mother, no!

302
00:34:48,241 --> 00:34:49,435
<i>Kothon!</i>

303
00:35:10,121 --> 00:35:13,511
<i>Avaggdu luatha bairn</i>
<i>off haefermore.</i>

304
00:35:27,601 --> 00:35:29,193
Begin the ritual.

305
00:35:29,321 --> 00:35:31,994
This baby will not destroy me.

306
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:37,959
Come, thunder!

307
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:41,838
Come, lightning!

308
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:46,156
Touch this altar
with your powers.

309
00:36:08,561 --> 00:36:11,598
We've come all this way
and now Elora Danan's gonna die!

310
00:36:11,721 --> 00:36:14,474
No, we can still defeat Bavmorda.

311
00:36:14,601 --> 00:36:16,592
She's too powerful, Raziel.

312
00:36:16,721 --> 00:36:19,713
Transform me,
and I will destroy her.

313
00:36:24,881 --> 00:36:28,556
Elements of eternity,
above and below.

314
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:33,150
Balance of essence,
fire beget snow.

315
00:36:34,641 --> 00:36:37,633
- <i>Locktwarr danalora luatha danu...</i>
- Willow...

316
00:36:37,761 --> 00:36:39,672
- believe in the words.
- <i>tuatha, tuatha...</i>

317
00:36:39,801 --> 00:36:41,871
- Concentrate.
- <i>chnox danu.</i>

318
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:43,559
<i>Locktwarr danalora...</i>

319
00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:47,390
- <i>luatha danu tuatha, tuatha.</i>
- Oh, no!

320
00:36:54,361 --> 00:36:59,310
Don't give up, Willow!

321
00:37:38,801 --> 00:37:42,555
- Has it been so long?
- I'm sorry.

322
00:37:44,841 --> 00:37:48,151
Willow, we have work to do.

323
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:51,073
Give me the wand.

324
00:37:51,801 --> 00:37:55,157
We must undo Bavmorda's sorcery.

325
00:37:57,921 --> 00:37:59,877
Let them in now.

326
00:38:04,441 --> 00:38:07,672
<i>Tuatha grin chnox</i>
<i>y foel famau.</i>

327
00:38:21,241 --> 00:38:24,233
Black fires
forever kindled within...

328
00:38:24,361 --> 00:38:26,511
let the second rite begin.

329
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:44,590
Quick, inside.

330
00:38:45,561 --> 00:38:47,916
That won't breach the wall.
We can't get inside.

331
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:50,839
- Elora Danan will die--
- Unless we save her.

332
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:53,236
- Bavmorda's too powerful.
- No!

333
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:58,472
She cannot transform you again.
My spell is protecting this camp.

334
00:38:58,601 --> 00:39:00,557
But can your magic
get us inside the fortress?

335
00:39:02,721 --> 00:39:04,393
We can't do it.

336
00:39:04,521 --> 00:39:06,079
Wait!

337
00:39:06,201 --> 00:39:09,113
Back home in my village,
we have a lot of gophers.

338
00:39:09,241 --> 00:39:11,471
- Willow, this is war, not agriculture.
- I know.

339
00:39:11,601 --> 00:39:14,559
But I have an idea
how to get inside the castle.

340
00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:21,919
<i>Ocht veth bordak stira.</i>

341
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:24,509
<i>Ocht veth bordak stira.</i>

342
00:39:32,561 --> 00:39:35,439
Madmartigan, you and I are soldiers.
The peck's plan will never work.

343
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:40,078
If the baby dies,
all hope for the future is lost.

344
00:39:42,401 --> 00:39:44,153
I'm going to fight.

345
00:39:47,521 --> 00:39:49,273
Me too.

346
00:39:56,361 --> 00:39:59,159
All right, we've got to decide
who's gonna go and who's gonna stay.

347
00:40:47,201 --> 00:40:51,877
Willow, all these years
I have waited to face Bavmorda.

348
00:40:52,001 --> 00:40:54,390
It is you
that has made this possible.

349
00:40:55,721 --> 00:40:59,760
Whatever happens,
I shall always admire you.

350
00:41:10,041 --> 00:41:12,236
Your children...

351
00:41:12,361 --> 00:41:14,921
will come to remember this day.

352
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:27,919
We call upon you to surrender!

353
00:41:30,001 --> 00:41:31,878
We are all-powerful sorcerers.

354
00:41:32,921 --> 00:41:36,277
Give us the baby,
or we'll destroy you!

355
00:41:42,281 --> 00:41:44,670
Kill them!

356
00:42:03,161 --> 00:42:04,719
Patience, Willow.

357
00:42:06,561 --> 00:42:08,153
Courage, Willow.

358
00:42:23,601 --> 00:42:25,557
Back to the castle!

359
00:42:50,121 --> 00:42:53,238
<i>Ocht veth nockthirth bordak!</i>

360
00:42:53,361 --> 00:42:57,036
Exile the child to the 1 3th night.

361
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:05,834
This way!

362
00:43:43,641 --> 00:43:49,637
<i>Nockthirth</i>
<i>plankton firth foreth forewar.</i>

363
00:43:49,761 --> 00:43:51,911
<i>Ocht veth nock!</i>

364
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:54,430
It's all right, Willow.

365
00:43:54,561 --> 00:43:56,358
You don't have to go.

366
00:43:56,481 --> 00:43:59,154
Light the 1 3th candle!

367
00:44:13,521 --> 00:44:15,193
Raziel.

368
00:44:15,321 --> 00:44:16,640
Mother!

369
00:44:20,601 --> 00:44:24,879
Traitor child.
I must despise you now.

370
00:44:54,081 --> 00:44:56,959
- I won't let you kill that child.
- Away!

371
00:44:57,081 --> 00:44:58,400
<i>Avaggdu...</i>

372
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:01,789
<i>strokt!</i>

373
00:45:17,641 --> 00:45:20,951
Your powers have gained
in strength, Raziel.

374
00:45:21,081 --> 00:45:25,996
I have Cherlindrea's wand,
Bavmorda.

375
00:45:28,201 --> 00:45:32,035
Elora Danan will be queen.

376
00:45:44,521 --> 00:45:45,670
Now you die!

377
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:52,799
<i>Furrochk flarem!</i>

378
00:46:21,641 --> 00:46:23,791
<i>Claideb cla</i>--

379

<i>Clai main!</i>
<i>Lunano ockht!</i>

380
00:46:30,681 --> 00:46:33,400
<i>Bachktu inno!</i>

381
00:48:20,681 --> 00:48:21,716
Airk!

382
00:48:24,881 --> 00:48:26,712
Win this war for me.

383
00:49:04,161 --> 00:49:05,594
Die!

384
00:51:00,281 --> 00:51:03,159
Bring back that child, peck.

385
00:51:07,201 --> 00:51:08,475
Who are you?

386
00:51:12,161 --> 00:51:14,038
I'm Willow Ufgood.

387
00:51:19,321 --> 00:51:20,913
I'm a great sorcerer.

388
00:51:22,521 --> 00:51:23,749
Greater than Raziel.

389
00:51:25,201 --> 00:51:26,953
Greater than you, even.

390
00:51:27,961 --> 00:51:29,838
I'm the greatest sorcerer!

391
00:51:49,121 --> 00:51:51,840
Is that the extent
of your powers, little one?

392
00:51:55,921 --> 00:52:00,119
Now you will watch me draw
upon the power of the universe...

393
00:52:00,241 --> 00:52:02,436
to send that child
into the netherworld.

394
00:52:02,561 --> 00:52:05,200
Now, place it on the altar!

395
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:15,836
No!

396
00:52:17,761 --> 00:52:18,955
No?

397
00:52:19,081 --> 00:52:21,549
You stupid hag!

398
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:24,957
With my magic,
I'll send her into the--

399
00:52:26,121 --> 00:52:27,031
Into a--

400
00:52:28,081 --> 00:52:29,833
You're no sorcerer.

401
00:52:29,961 --> 00:52:32,634
Into a realm
where evil cannot touch her.

402
00:52:32,761 --> 00:52:34,035
Impossible!

403
00:52:34,161 --> 00:52:38,154
- There's no such place!
- <i>Helgafel swath ben helgafel.</i>

404
00:52:38,281 --> 00:52:40,272
You are a fool!

405
00:52:40,401 --> 00:52:43,438
I shall destroy you
and the child with you.

406
00:52:43,561 --> 00:52:45,836
- Damn fool!
- <i>Bairn off danu famoww.</i>

407
00:52:47,041 --> 00:52:48,235
Goodbye, Elora.

408
00:52:48,361 --> 00:52:51,273
<i>Bohi bakstiy.</i>

409
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:53,596
<i>Helgafel!</i>

410
00:52:59,041 --> 00:53:03,114
Impossible!

411
00:53:07,801 --> 00:53:09,757
You--

412
00:53:49,761 --> 00:53:51,797
Willow, where's the baby?

413
00:53:54,281 --> 00:53:57,000
It was just my old
disappearing pig trick.

414
00:54:00,761 --> 00:54:02,877
Well done!

415
00:54:05,841 --> 00:54:08,753
Willow Ufgood,
receive this book of magic.

416
00:54:08,881 --> 00:54:12,635
You are on your way
to becoming a great sorcerer.

417
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,634
- Willow the Sorcerer!
- You make us proud!

418
00:54:25,281 --> 00:54:26,794
Goodbye, Elora Danan.

419
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:46,634
Goodbye, Willow!

420
00:54:46,761 --> 00:54:48,194
Farewell!

421
00:55:03,561 --> 00:55:05,631
Willow! Willow!

422
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:08,321
Willow's back!

423
00:55:16,001 --> 00:55:19,357
- Willow!
- Hey, Meegosh!

424
00:55:33,521 --> 00:55:35,637
It's a bird!
He made a bird!

425
00:55:45,281 --> 00:55:46,475
Kiaya!

426
00:55:49,561 --> 00:55:52,837
- Willow?
- Kiaya.

427
00:55:58,881 --> 00:56:01,156
- Dada! Dada!
- Dada, I missed you!

428
00:56:01,281 --> 00:56:02,634
I missed you.
