00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,240
[Episode 7]

3
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,040
See this?

4
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,080
There are hoe marks everywhere.

5
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,040
Yes.

6
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,200
This hole is round like it was drawn by a compass.

7
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,560
It's too round.

8
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,720
I think...

9
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,880
that...

10
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,520
Senior Mojin dug this hole.

11
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,880
What are you talking about?

12
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,560
Let me tell you.

13
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,600
When we came down,

14
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,640
we saw the corpse of a Mojin Xiaowei.

15
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,200
It proves that Old Hu was right,

16
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,880
there's a huge tomb
underneath Fish-skeleton Temple.

17
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,200
It's a Western Zhou tomb...

18
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,760
as we found a bronze cauldron from Western Zhou.

19
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,480
Did I miss so many things?

20
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,400
It's fine.

21
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,800
I can bring you back to have a look.

22
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,560
No.

23
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,520
No, I won't go.

24
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,600
Don't scare him.

25
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,800
If he runs again,

26
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,960
we won't be able to catch up.

27
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,160
Let's go in and take a look.

28
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,600
Let's go, Old Jin. Stand up.

29
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,880
Stand up. Let me help you.

30
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,440
Old Hu.

31
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:32,960
Come on.

32
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,120
This immortal saved us.

33
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,680
Thank you for your blessing.

34
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,040
Thank you for your blessing.

35
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,160
Thank you for your blessing.

36
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,320
Thank you.

37
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,520
Guys,

38
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,960
look.

39
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,320
Are these beams...

40
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,680
built with fish bones?

41
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,200
Yes, indeed.

42
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,160
Isn't this Fish-skeleton Temple?

43
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,880
Looks like you've got it right.

44
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,480
This Fish-skeleton Temple...

45
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,560
is the entrance of the tomb.

46
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,480
It's all thanks to
that Mojin Xiaowei.

47
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,200
I will ask around...

48
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,640
who this senior is.

49
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,800
I need to take a break.

50
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,880
Fatty,

51
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,640
are you scratching against the tree like a bear?

52
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,360
No, I can't reach it.

53
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,200
Come and scratch for me.

54
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,000
Sure.

55
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,320
Here?

56
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,880
Move to this side.

57
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,160
What happened to your back?

58
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,600
Why is there swelling?

59
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,560
Swelling?

60
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,360
Why don't you take off your clothes?

61
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,880
There's something.

62
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,360
Turn around.

63
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,600
Fatty,

64
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,440
well,

65
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,200
the rash that you had...

66
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,400
changed.

67
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,200
Changed to what?

68
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,480
It changed to...

69
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,280
an eyeball.

70
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,760
Eyeball?

71
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,280
What's wrong?

72
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,200
Old Hu.

73
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,360
Did your rash change?

74
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,280
Mine?

75
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,360
Hurry, take a look!

76
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,440
Don't be anxious.

77
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,560
Be gentle.

78
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,400
Let's take a look.

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,880
Did you see it?

80
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,600
It changed!

81
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,880
There is an eye here.

82
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,760
Just like yours.

83
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,480
Just like mine?

84
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,160
Yes...

85
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,320
Really?

86
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,480
Yes.

87
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,440
What does it look like? Let me see.

88
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,560
Like this.

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,920
Li hexagram.

90
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,480
Li hexagram?

91
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,360
What is that?

92
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,640
Do you remember the talisman Blind Chen gave us?

93
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,880
Yes.

94
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
We didn't manage to find out...

95
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,600
what the last one means.

96
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
Isn't it a Li hexagram?

97
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,320
No...

98
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,800
Aren't we talking about the eye?

99
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,200
Why mentioned Li hexagram here?

100
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,160
Yes.

101
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,360
The hexagram...

102
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,120
corresponds to natural phenomena...

103
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,680
and also human organs.

104
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,360
Li hexagram corresponds to the human eye.

105
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,600
Old Hu, you mean...

106
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,240
when that blind man gave us the talisman,

107
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,440
he knew...

108
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,360
the eye would appear on our backs?

109
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,120
This is amazing.

110
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,680
I admit he's an expert.

111
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,920
But he isn't that good.

112
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,080
Did he hear us talking about the rash...

113
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,080
when we were at the water house?

114
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,360
I don't think so. We...

115
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,680
didn't talk about eyes.

116
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,760
Yes.

117
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,560
Why did he know about the rash?

118
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,120
No,

119
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,120
that old man is odd.

120
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,560
If he had any purposes...

121
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,680
or wanted to know anything,

122
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,440
why didn't he ask us?

123
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,880
Now to think about it,

124
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,680
the second hexagram
that refers to the southwest...

125
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,120
might not refer to the ferry.

126
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,920
It must be Fish-skeleton Temple.

127
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,560
Why is he so familiar with...

128
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,680
this Mojin Xiaowei?

129
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,360
There must be something going on.

130
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,320
You're right.

131
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,720
No way. I have to go back to him.

132
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,560
I have to ask about this.

133
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,160
Mr. Hu,

134
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,440
don't do that.

135
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,560
Ma Da Dan and his bunch of ruffians...

136
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,240
won't let us go easily.

137
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,320
Where Blind Chen is staying now...

138
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,360
is inside the hostel.

139
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,520
If Ma Da Dan left an informer there...

140
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,560
to wait for us,

141
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,880
we'll be caught if we head there.

142
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,360
I think...

143
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,200
we should leave this place immediately.

144
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,920
This may be just a common skin disease.

145
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,000
Let's go to 301 Hospital...

146
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,000
and take some medicine. We may recover easily.

147
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,720
No, Mr. Jin.

148
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,120
It's easier said than done.

149
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,680
This thing isn't on your back.

150
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,320
Let me tell you,

151
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,200
whenever I think...

152
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,680
about this thing on my back,

153
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,240
I feel uncomfortable.

154
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,000
That's right.

155
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,320
I don't want to escape
without knowing anything...

156
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,000
with something strange on my back.

157
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,200
How about this?

158
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,440
Fatty, bring Golden Tooth back to Beijing.

159
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,640
I will go to Blind Chen.

160
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,520
I won't go back.

161
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,560
I have to be with you.

162
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,360
Then, what if...

163
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,600
Well, no...

164
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,960
Old Jin,

165
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,120
don't you want to go back to Beijing?

166
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,200
You can go back yourself.

167
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,040
Mr. Jin.

168
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,120
You don't have any rash on your back.

169
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,480
This doesn't concern you.

170
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,920
We're being straightforward.

171
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,800
It's reasonable for you to withdraw now.

172
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,600
Fatty and I understand.

173
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,760
Yes.

174
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,120
I know you well.

175
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,480
You're flabby,

176
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,880
afraid and weak, right?

177
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,880
If I'm weak, I'm a fool.

178
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,360
I'm just...

179
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,440
worried about our safety.

180
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,680
Since we're here,

181
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,480
fine.

182
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,320
I will accompany...

183
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,240
the both of you until the end.

184
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,440
Mr. Jin,

185
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,360
you don't look like a man.

186
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,000
However,

187
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,120
you're a...

188
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,320
Let me finish talking.

189
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,040
Now, we should...

190
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,360
go to Old Man Wang's house...

191
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,360
to eat and replenish our energy.

192
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,000
During midnight,

193
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,120
we will head to that hostel.

194
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,360
You mean...

195
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,440
enter the village quietly.

196
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,800
Don't alert others.

197
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,520
Are you a ghost?

198
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,840
Hang on.

199
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,880
We're here...

200
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,360
Sir.

201
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,280
Sir.

202
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,440
Sir!

203
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,480
Sir!

204
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,360
Sir.

205
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,920
Young men.

206
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,400
You're here again.

207
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,200
Why are you in this state?

208
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,480
You're thirsty again?

209
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,800
You're hungry again?

210
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,120
You're tired again?

211
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,240
We're ill.

212
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,760
Sir,

213
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,920
please give us a room...

214
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,360
to rest, is that okay?

215
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,680
It's not that I don't want to let you in.

216
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,960
That professor that I told you about...

217
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,600
is here from Beijing.

218
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,120
He stays at my house every time.

219
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,120
He has a strange temper,

220
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,920
he doesn't want to meet outsiders.

221
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,320
This time,

222
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,000
he brought along a female assistant.

223
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,000
It's even more inconvenient.

224
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,120
Sir, we're in this state.

225
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,240
Let us in to drink some water...

226
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,680
and get changed.

227
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,240
Yes.

228
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,240
It's just a woman.

229
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,440
We don't think it's inconvenient.

230
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,480
It's fine. I mean it.

231
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,560
It's not that I don't agree, I can't do that.

232
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,360
Hu Ba Yi.

233
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,360
American Girl.

234
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,480
I went to Beijing to look for you.

235
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,440
But we met here instead.

236
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,280
Why are you here?

237
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,560
It's a long story.

238
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,880
This is...

239
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,880
This is Professor Sun.

240
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,360
An expert from National
Cultural Heritage Administration.

241
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,080
This is Hu Ba Yi.

242
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,480
This is Wang Kai Xuan.

243
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,600
They are members of...

244
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,280
the Ancient City of Jingjue team
of Professor Chen and me.

245
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
This is Boss Jin.

246
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,000
Mr. Jin.

247
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,120
Just call me Golden Tooth.

248
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,840
Why are you here?

249
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,320
Do you have...

250
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,360
an eyeball rash on you?

251
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,360
How do you know that?

252
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,840
Do you have it too?

253
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,680
I'm sorry.

254
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,760
I dragged everyone into this mess.

255
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,280
What do you mean?

256
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,600
The rash on us...

257
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,720
is a virus.

258
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,800
Have you ever heard of
the Moving Mountain Sect?

259
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,440
Mojin Xiaowei...

260
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,960
Tomb Raiding Sect,

261
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,240
Moving Mountain Sect and
Unloading Mountain Sect...

262
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,600
are the legendary four sects, right?

263
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,080
It's just a representation.

264
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,960
There is another origin about
the Moving Mountain Sect.

265
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,560
For thousands of years,

266
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,240
they think they originated from this rash...

267
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,880
and died from this rash.

268
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,680
Die?

269
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,960
Many years ago,

270
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,600
on Mount Zagrama near the Western Regions,

271
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,160
there was a tribe.

272
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,960
They were known as the Zagrama Tribe.

273
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,240
They migrated from Europe...

274
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,960
and lived here aloof from world affairs...

275
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,880
until someone found...

276
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,560
a deep Ghost Cave by chance.

277
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,440
Their tribe's prophet

278
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,360
led them to worship the cave...

279
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,320
and tried to find out the secret of the Ghost Cave.

280
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,040
But it brought to them a terrible curse.

281
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,040
A rash that looked like an eye...

282
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,800
appeared on everyone

283
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,760
that was cursed.

284
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,800
It would stay there forever.

285
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,400
People who had the rash...

286
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,960
would die before they were 50 years old.

287
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,520
Although they didn't die immediately,

288
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,000
right before they died,

289
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,400
their blood would gradually turn yellow,

290
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,560
experience difficulty in breathing...

291
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,000
and suffer.

292
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,240
The prophet divined that...

293
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,880
the Central Plains World has...

294
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,400
a holy bead that is the same as the rash.

295
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,000
If the holy bead is found, they can break the curse...

296
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,720
and save their tribe.

297
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:55,800
Hence,

298
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,000
the Zagrama tribe...

299
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,360
migrated inland...

300
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,440
and was gradually assimilated by the Chinese.

301
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,520
At last,

302
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,840
deduced from many clues,

303
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,360
they confirmed that this bead...

304
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,320
is the legendary...

305
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,600
Dust Bead.

306
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,640
Then,

307
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,200
the descendants of the Zagrama tribe...

308
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,480
started their journey...

309
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,560
to find the Dust Bead.

310
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,880
They think that the Dust Bead do exist,

311
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,840
but was buried in an ancient tomb...

312
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,200
together with the corpse.

313
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,680
To break free from the rash,

314
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,840
they had to separate...

315
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,600
and search for the Dust Bead in different tombs.

316
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,480
This Moving Mountain Sect...

317
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,720
is good at the Five Elements.

318
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,080
They called themselves as Taoists.

319
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,480
They only want medicine...

320
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,200
and aren't greedy for wealth.

321
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,200
Unexpectedly, they have their difficulties.

322
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,080
By the way, Miss Yang.

323
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,960
you made me confused.

324
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,920
I didn't understand one thing.

325
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,680
This is a rash curse...

326
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,320
or is it a virus?

327
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,480
They called it a curse...

328
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,400
because people in the past...

329
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,240
had limited scientific knowledge.

330
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,240
They often misinterpret
unexplained phenomena...

331
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,520
as Xuanxue.

332
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,080
After our research,

333
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,600
we confirmed that...

334
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,240
it is a disease caused by a virus.

335
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,760
To make it simple,

336
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,360
the virus disrupted the absorption of iron...

337
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,800
by red cell hemoglobin,

338
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,320
causing IDN symptoms.

339
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,200
Blood will gradually turn yellow...

340
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,360
and breathing ability will decrease.

341
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,480
At last,

342
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,080
the patient will die
due to multiple organ failure.

343
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,080
Why are you surprised?

344
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,960
It has nothing to do with you.

345
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,360
The imperialists will never abandon
its intention, right?

346
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,080
No.

347
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,480
You knew we would be infected with the rash...

348
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,760
once we go there.

349
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,600
Why did you involve Old Hu and me?

350
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,240
What are you thinking?

351
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,680
It's a pity that Old Hu...

352
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,720
Fatty. Fatty

353
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,840
Calm down, will you?

354
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,960
It has already happened, what else can we do?

355
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,960
We should treat the illness by finding a cure.

356
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,040
It's no use worrying.

357
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,080
Listen to her carefully.

358
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,480
I listened carefully.

359
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,440
She pranked us!

360
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,440
Can't you tell it?

361
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,600
Why are you still defending her?

362
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,960
She wants you to die!

363
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,840
She didn't mean that, okay?

364
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,440
I'm sorry.

365
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,800
It was my bad.

366
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,600
If I knew you would infect with the rash

367
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,880
after the trip to the Ancient City of Jingjue.

368
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,600
I wouldn't involve you.

369
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,440
Fine. I got it.

370
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,200
So,

371
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,880
I'm trying my best...

372
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,680
to make it up.

373
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,720
Make up for what?

374
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,680
Can you make up for my life?

375
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,200
American Girl, just wait and see.

376
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,360
Without a satisfactory answer,

377
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,840
if I let you return to U.S.,

378
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,600
I will...

379
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,480
Fatty.

380
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,120
Don't go too far.

381
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,280
Can you treat our international friend nicely?

382
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,960
Let her finish talking. Hurry, sit down.

383
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,400
Sit down.

384
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,800
Yes, drink some water.

385
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,160
This time, I came back to China...

386
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,120
to find the Dust Bead.

387
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,400
I hope to solve the problem for everyone.

388
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,320
What?

389
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,640
You know where the Dust Bead is?

390
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,840
The Dust Bead...

391
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,840
isn't that easy to find.

392
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,560
It's one of...

393
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,920
the legendary three great beads
of Central Plains.

394
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,600
After the Shang Dynasty,

395
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,040
it went missing.

396
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,320
For you, Miss Yang...

397
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,480
came from afar and
tried all means to see me...

398
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,920
so I would help her to find the Dust Bead.

399
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,440
According to historical records,

400
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,880
the 32nd King of the Shang Dynasty, Wang Wu Ding...

401
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,360
found a giant eye-shaped jade...

402
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,600
in a collapsed mountain.

403
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,200
Wu Ding believed that...

404
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,720
this jade was mother earth in phoenix form,

405
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,440
representing the immortal
Eye of Reincarnation.

406
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,720
He named it as the Dust Bead,

407
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,280
commonly known as the Phoenix Gall.

408
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,240
After the fall of Shang Dynasty,

409
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,800
the Dust Bead went missing.

410
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,960
It is said that...

411
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,040
King Wen of Zhou recorded its whereabouts...

412
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,320
on a turtle plastron.

413
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,640
But, this...

414
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,320
plastron, known as the Book of Dragon Bones...

415
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,120
is also missing now.

416
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,320
You talked about useless stuff...

417
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,600
to tell us that...

418
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,120
we can't find the bead now?

419
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,200
Miss Yang,

420
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,920
since you're here,

421
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,840
you must have found other clues.

422
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,080
Pardon me,

423
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,120
but we're in this state,

424
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,320
you should reveal...

425
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,080
why you are familiar with
the Moving Mountain Sect.

426
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:17,960
Yes.

427
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,200
How do you know about that Za...

428
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,680
Zagrama.

429
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,800
About the Zagrama tribe?

430
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,440
I am a descendant of the Zagrama tribe.

431
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,360
My grandfather,

432
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,920
known as Zhe Gu Shao,

433
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,040
is the last Moving Mountain disciple.

434
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,440
My grandfather left this for me,

435
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,240
the last clue about the Dust Bead.

436
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,480
If you want to know...

437
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,200
more about my grandfather,

438
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,360
it's all in this notebook.

439
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,080
The rash curse has been troubling
our tribe for a few thousand years.

440
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,920
Our tribe is in despair...

441
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,320
and tried our best until the day we die.

442
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,440
But we still suffer from
the same destiny as our ancestors.

443
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,240
Now,

444
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,680
our tribe is dying.

445
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,600
I brought my juniors, Old White Man and Hua Ling...

446
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,080
and entered Mount of Vase.

447
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,800
We learnt that Dust Bead is at
Black Water City of ancient Western Xia.

448
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,760
My pity juniors died in a foreign land.

449
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,800
My heart aches for them.

450
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,280
I'm Zhe Gu Shao

451
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,400
from Moving Mountain Sect.

452
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,280
You're the leader of Moving Mountain Sect.

453
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,640
I heard that...

454
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,040
you're the first disciple of
Zhang San Ye from Mojin Xiaowei.

455
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,280
I hope you can teach me your skills.

456
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,040
I have been living in seclusion for many years.

457
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,120
I'm no longer related to my previous life.

458
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,960
Moreover,

459
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,000
I heard that the Moving Mountain
tomb raiders...

460
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,160
only wants the elixir of immortality...

461
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,960
and aren't interested in gold and jade items.

462
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,280
To be honest,

463
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,520
the elixir of immortality is just a rumor.

464
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,520
The Moving Mountain Sect wants...

465
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,040
the Dust Bead.

466
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,720
The Moving Mountain disciples
are from the same tribe.

467
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,480
Our ancestors were cursed...

468
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,240
not to live past 50 years old.

469
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,960
Only the Dust Bead can break that curse.

470
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,400
But, your sect...

471
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,600
has your own skills.

472
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,000
Why do you want to learn our skills?

473
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,680
I found out that the Dust Bead...

474
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,240
is in a treasure cave in Western Xia.

475
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,920
This cave is well hidden.

476
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,720
We can't find it...

477
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,960
using our skills.

478
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,520
I heard Mojin Xiaowei...

479
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,920
is good at finding dragons and
determining good or ill luck.

480
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,280
I think...

481
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
with your skills,

482
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,760
I will be able to find the Dust Bead.

483
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,680
I promised...

484
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,480
to stop and not rob tombs anymore.

485
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,760
Once the artifacts reappear,

486
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,520
there will be great bloodshed.

487
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,960
But this concerns your tribe's trouble.

488
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,120
I can't stand aside and watch.

489
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,120
Fine.

490
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,120
I can teach you my skills.

491
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,960
But, according to the rules,

492
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,760
you must first sign a Pledge of Allegiance.

493
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,880
I will give you the Mojin Talisman.

494
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,960
Thank you for your kindness.

495
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,720
Ten miles northwest from here,

496
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,120
there's a wordless half stone.

497
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,960
Underneath it...

498
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,480
is a Southern Song tomb.

499
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,840
That tomb...

500
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,320
is not in a right direction,

501
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,960
fierce,

502
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,880
shaped like a broken sword
and an overturned boat.

503
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,000
It's a vicious tomb.

504
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,360
Zombies are easily spawned there.

505
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,480
Remember the rules of Mojin Xiaowei.

506
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,280
When the rooster crows, stop robbing.

507
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,960
When the light goes off, stop robbing.

508
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,760
After the rooster crows,

509
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,440
it's not good to continue robbing the grave.

510
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,800
We are most afraid of seeing...

511
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,960
cats, foxes and weasels in tombs...

512
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,760
as it's easy for corpses to turn to zombies.

513
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,880
Even if it happens,

514
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,760
I must bring back the burial clothes.

515
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,520
That was how I got into the tomb
and retrieved the burial clothes.

516
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,440
Not bad.

517
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,520
Be straightforward.

518
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,440
However,

519
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,280
I got the burial clothes when the
rooster crowed and the light went out.

520
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,520
I couldn't differentiate
which came first...

521
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,760
and which came later.

522
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,920
I couldn't decide...

523
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,600
if this was against the rules.

524
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,280
Due to your sect's rules,

525
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,480
I won't make it difficult for you.

526
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,520
If I managed to survive in the future,

527
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,760
I will come and listen to your teachings.

528
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,840
Wait.

529
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,560
If you don't learn my skills,

530
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,200
how will you find the Dust Bead?

531
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,440
Faith will...

532
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,880
move mountains.

533
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,080
I will think of another way.

534
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,760
Since you came here for my help,

535
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,520
it must be fated.

536
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,720
It is my fate.

537
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,680
You mean...

538
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,000
you're willing to teach me?

539
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,000
You don't care that I might have broken the rules?

540
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,920
First,

541
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,280
saving those who suffer brings joy,

542
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,760
it is the teaching of Buddha.

543
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,000
Since I know about the sufferings of your tribe,

544
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,040
I can't stand aside and watch.

545
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,520
Second,

546
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,520
you didn't hide the fact that...

547
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,520
you only managed to get the burial clothes...

548
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,400
when the rooster crowed and
the light went off at the same time.

549
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,000
You're skilled...

550
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,560
and honest.

551
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,040
You're commendable.

552
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,000
Thank you for not giving up on me.

553
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,360
I am lucky to be your disciple.

554
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,760
Dear Master,

555
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,360
please accept my bows.

556
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,880
Zhe Gu Shao,

557
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,680
let me ask you.

558
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,560
What is the most important...

559
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,640
for a Mojin Xiaowei?

560
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,320
I am foolish,

561
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,480
please enlighten me.

562
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,560
Benevolence,

563
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,480
provide joy to all beings.

564
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,320
Compassion, remove sorrows from all beings.

565
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,080
Being a Mojin is sinful.

566
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,320
We can't have bad vices.

567
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,720
Since I am your teacher,

568
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,360
I should teach you to do good deeds.

569
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:56,720
I know...

570
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,080
that you're an expert.

571
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,840
However, if you don't have benevolence...

572
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,880
and only make cruel decisions,

573
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,560
I'm afraid...

574
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,520
you can control your own life...

575
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,280
but not your fate.

576
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,560
Do you understand?

577
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,600
Yes.

578
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,240
I will spare lives...

579
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,320
without acting rashly.

580
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,960
Not only humans.

581
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,360
Although a wild cat is an animal,

582
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,760
it is a living being.

583
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,280
You shouldn't kick it to death in the tomb.

584
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,520
From now on, whenever you do anything,

585
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,000
you should spare your opponent's life.

586
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,360
Yes.

587
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,480
Come with me...

588
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,400
and burn the burial clothes of
the Southern Song female corpse.

589
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,640
Let's read the Rebirth Mantra...

590
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,320
so the zombie and wild cat...

591
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,040
will find bliss.

592
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,600
Tomorrow,

593
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,280
we will...

594
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,800
begin our journey to find the Dust Bead.

595
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:14,960
