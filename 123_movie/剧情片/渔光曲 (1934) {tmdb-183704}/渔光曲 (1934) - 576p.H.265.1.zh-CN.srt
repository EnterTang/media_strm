1
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:20,004
Stand by for the mail.

2
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:25,009
Stand by for the mail.

3
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:47,096
We know you're not a pirate.

4
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,242
You'll get your knife back
when we dock in Singapore.

5
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,341
Get on the phone
and call Scranton, PA.

6
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:55,743
- Ask about J. Wilberforce Timmons.
- Have you any arms, sir?

7
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:58,645
Just these you see
growing out of me armpits.

8
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:03,147
No excuses, Mr. Atkins,
your job is to look after this dock.

9
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:08,454
If I ever find it in this state again, I'll...
How's your wife?

10
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:12,655
She's very much better, sir.
And thank you very much for the flowers.

11
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:15,596
Don't thank me. My gardener has
to get rid of them somehow.

12
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:17,030
Who's the big shot?

13
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:19,569
Sir Guy Wilmerding,
managing director of the line.

14
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:23,175
This way, Sir Guy. Gangway, please.
Glad to have you with us again, sir.

15
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:26,278
None of that mush.
I know how glad you are.

16
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:35,348
Not bad.
Not bad at all for a synthetic stone.

17
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,819
You ought to know, Paul.

18
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,083
My lovely Olga!

19
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:52,828
- Hey, I bet that lug's tops in China.
- That's the insignia of Wing Yu-Lan.

20
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,697
Everything in the archipelago
pays dividends to him.

21
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,948
- Good morning, purser.
- Good morning, Miss Yu-Lan.

22
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:07,109
We've arranged to take your
chairs aboard in the after-gangway.

23
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,686
Thank you.

24
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:23,599
- Mr. Dawson, here comes the captain.
- Look at him, with a three-days hangover.

25
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,635
And watch him grouse.

26
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:30,708
Of all the ungrateful, brass-hearted
skippers of a rusty old teakettle...

27
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,539
...who thinks he's still strutting it
in the Royal Navy.

28
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,185
Captain.

29
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:47,786
Alan! Alan Gaskell.
I've got some last-minute cargo for you.

30
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,054
Ken, what are you doing up
in broad daylight?

31
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,688
Captain Gaskell, I want you to meet
Charlie McCaleb, the American novelist.

32
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,493
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

33
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:58,262
Well, Hong Kong seems to have
taken you to her bosom.

34
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:02,169
I've seen your face before. Don't tell me.
It's right on the tip of my tongue.

35
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,832
- Remember Johnson?
- Johnson?

36
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,409
- Who?
- Johnson.

37
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,809
- Johnny, what are you doing way out here?
- Maybe you could tell me.

38
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:12,315
No, no, this is Captain Gaskell,
the master of the ship you're on.

39
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:16,546
- Aye, captain. Coming along with us?
- Yes. Yes, I'm afraid so.

40
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:19,021
He's over here gathering material
for a new novel.

41
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,990
I've dragged him through wars,
riots and revolutions.

42
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:25,824
He doesn't even know he's in China.
If you should stir up anything exciting...

43
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:29,332
...shove him in a front seat
and tie his eyes open, will you?

44
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:33,563
I'm not running a nursery. I'm not stirring
up excitement for the sake of literature.

45
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,264
- See you later.
- Don't you worry.

46
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:39,639
I'll be right there. I'm the old
Ringside Kid. Got an eye like an eagle.

47
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:43,213
Goodbye, Captain Griscol.
I had a marvelous trip.

48
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:48,815
Ship ahoy! Ship ahoy!

49
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,786
Ship ahoy.

50
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:58,092
- Are you all right, Charlie?
- I cover the waterfront.

51
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,799
- Steward!
- Good morning, sir.

52
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,638
- Is that clean brass?
- Sorry, sir...

53
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:16,908
- You haven't answered my question!
- No, sir, it isn't clean brass, sir.

54
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,482
- You've been sampling my whiskey again.
- Yes, sir.

55
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,745
- Not as good as the last lot, is it?
- No, sir.

56
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,513
- Do something about it.
- I will.

57
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,284
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir. Sir Guy wants to see you.

58
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,324
- Good morning, captain.
- Good morning.

59
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,230
So there you are.

60
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:35,856
- Morning, Mrs. Aiken.
- We were just talking about you, captain.

61
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:38,629
Mrs. Aiken tells me you've been
sensationally blotto...

62
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,432
...ever since you went ashore.

63
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:43,439
- Sir Guy...
- Oh, she does, eh?

64
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:48,171
If you don't like my behavior ashore
or aboard ship, you can get a new boy.

65
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,010
- In fact, I wish you would.
- You wouldn't go if you could.

66
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,709
Wouldn't I? I'm so close
to being back in England...

67
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:57,083
...I can hear Big Ben chiming.
- I've heard that for 50 years.

68
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:59,724
Only the weak ones
sneak out of the China Seas.

69
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:02,053
It's the bullheads like you that stay on.

70
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,822
What about a little spot
to keep your brain from addling?

71
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:08,728
I haven't the time. I've got to get
the pride of your fleet underway.

72
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:12,234
Mr. Rockwell, go to the captain's saloon.
Check those chronometers.

73
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:13,963
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

74
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,801
Third officer isn't aboard yet, sir.

75
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,842
I know. I've been looking him over
at the Sepoy Hospital.

76
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,002
Cleaned out
High Spade McQueen's last night.

77
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,943
- Bad, sir?
- Yes, knife in the kidneys.

78
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,812
Port captain's trying to find someone
to replace him.

79
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:29,512
- What have you got in your mouth?
- Chewing tobacco, sir.

80
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,419
Bad enough having a ship like this
and a captain like me...

81
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,583
...without having a chief officer like you!

82
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:38,629
Sorry, sir. I had it in my jaw when
I came on duty, and I forgot all about it.

83
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:42,290
Mr. Willet of the Royal Canada Bank
is waiting to see you, sir.

84
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:45,335
- Just down there at your quarters.
- Thank you.

85
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,335
- Hello, Willet.
- Good morning, captain.

86
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,909
- The gold come aboard yet?
- Yes, sir.

87
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,377
All stowed away as we agreed?

88
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,021
In the steamroller.

89
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,519
- Good.
- Thank you, sir.

90
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:18,961
Wipe that smile off your face!

91
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:26,436
Is that your idea of clean brass?
You haven't answered my question!

92
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,102
Did I ask you...?

93
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,614
Little too big for you,
isn't it, Mr. Rockwell.

94
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:36,949
I apologize, sir. Chief Officer sent me down
to check the chronometers.

95
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:43,095
- Well, I don't keep them in my cap.
- No, sir.

96
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:49,360
- What are you going to do with that button?
- Button it, sir.

97
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:56,400
I was just hoping you weren't too
angry with me, sir.

98
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,344
Well, carry on.

99
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,080
Thank you, sir.

100
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,353
Excuse me, sir.

101
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,894
Who's in there?

102
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:26,767
- China Doll, the gal that drives men mad.
- What the devil are you doing aboard?

103
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:31,069
Nothing alarming, just showering
the dewdrops off the body beautiful.

104
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:38,408
How many hours do we have to spend
saying goodbye before it takes?

105
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:41,553
That's just the trouble, toots,
it took too good.

106
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:43,954
Gee, you were sweet to me.

107
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:48,048
Say, maybe you could use all that money
you won at the Tai Fan last night.

108
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:50,320
- Then we were there?
- We had a million laughs.

109
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:53,829
- I made 17 passes myself.
- Get on your horse. We're shoving off here...

110
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,492
Why so anxious to get me out?
Is that hunk of caviar making the round trip?

111
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,003
- What hunk of caviar?
- That redheaded Russian princess.

112
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:05,132
She isn't a Russian or a princess.
I have my doubts about her hair being red.

113
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,905
If she was a Chinese sextet,
it'd be the same to me.

114
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,345
I'm trying to get through your numskull
that I won't stand by and...

115
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,178
Now, wait a minute, Dolly!

116
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,910
You and I are friends.

117
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,987
We've had a lot of fun together.

118
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:20,956
And as far as I'm concerned,
you're number one girl in the archipelago.

119
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,721
But I don't remember making
any vows to you...

120
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,523
...nor do I recall asking for any.

121
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:30,032
Don't you get polite at me. When you
start talking with your high-hat on...

122
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:33,933
...I know you mean it, and it scares me.

123
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,973
Who do you think you are?
If I had a nickel's worth of pride...

124
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,407
If that's the way you feel,
I'm not in your wake.

125
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,377
That's just the soup I'm in.
I don't feel that way at all.

126
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,050
You dog.

127
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,886
Well, that's more like it.

128
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,026
Come in.

129
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,657
- Pilot tug's alongside, sir.
- Stand by to single up your lines.

130
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,425
Aye, aye, sir.

131
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,631
All right now, nuisance, over shore.

132
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,500
Look, what am I gonna do with my ticket?
It's all paid for.

133
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:10,471
I knew something's up your sleeve.
We'll get your money back.

134
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:14,010
- I got a job in Singapore. Honest.
- I suppose they've elected you mayor.

135
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,843
It's on the level. Hoffman sent me
a contract for the rest of the season.

136
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,349
I know how you feel.
I won't come near you.

137
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,781
No.

138
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:27,085
All right, toots, you win.
I hope you have a good trip.

139
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,920
Goodbye.

140
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,299
All right, all right. If you've
got your ticket and a job...

141
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,302
...I don't suppose I've got...
- Lambie!

142
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,873
Stop wrestling me around!

143
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:46,307
You're turning this skiff
into an excursion launch.

144
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,781
Come on, snap into it
with that fore-hold loading!

145
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,651
So you just came down to say goodbye...

146
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,120
...with enough cigarettes
for a New York voyage.

147
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,782
I'll smoke a lot more cigarettes
than that, toots...

148
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,327
...before we ever really say goodbye.

149
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:14,831
Listen, I told you to...

150
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,471
Good morning, sir.

151
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,202
Davids, isn't it? Tom Davids?

152
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,607
Yes, sir.

153
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:25,615
Your port captain told me
to report for duty as third officer.

154
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:28,647
- Duty as what?
- Third officer.

155
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,079
These rocking-chair sailors ashore.

156
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:34,283
Here I am in the middle of typhoon season,
a tough voyage ahead.

157
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,621
I ask for a fighter.
They send a punching bag.

158
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:39,729
Give me a chance. It's the first
one I've had for over a year.

159
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,630
I know these waters better than most.
I've sailed them for over 10 years.

160
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,966
No one had a better record
on this coast than I had.

161
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:50,639
Then, just because of an accident...
I'm not a coward.

162
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:55,213
Stow it. You let pirates scuttle your ship.
You lost every white man except yourself.

163
00:11:55,381 --> 00:12:00,114
- Board of Trade lifted your ticket. I didn't.
- Give me a chance. Please.

164
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,919
You got a uniform?

165
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:06,853
Nothing clean, sir.

166
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,119
I'll have the steward
give you one of mine.

167
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,126
- Yes, sir.
- Report to Mr. Dawson.

168
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,527
I'll have the uniform laundered
and returned.

169
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:16,224
No, that's all right, keep it.
You'll probably need it.

170
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,960
Thank you, sir.

171
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,841
Well, if it ain't old rough-on-rats himself.
How are you, Jamesy?

172
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:29,413
Dolly, you're looking just as pretty as ever.
Bidding the big boy goodbye?

173
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,574
- Goodbye nothing. I'm making this voyage.
- No, you're not.

174
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,721
Why, I'm just as happy as if I'd won
the Calcutta sweepstakes.

175
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:38,550
You ought to have the shekels piled up
to the roof by now.

176
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:41,249
I haven't done so bad, you know.

177
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,225
Dolly, I'm still willing
to share it all with you.

178
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:47,365
Say, there ain't enough dough in all
Asia to make me change...

179
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,398
...the way I feel about one guy.

180
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:51,798
Still crazy about that Gaskell, huh?

181
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,769
Whenever you get tired
of running around with an Airedale...

182
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,307
...and you want to run around with
a Saint Bernard, why, you let me know.

183
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:01,071
Sure. When I get lost in the Alps,
I'll whistle for you.

184
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,579
All right, I'll come running.
Goodbye, Dolly.

185
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,080
See you later.

186
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:10,018
You be easy with them there pigs.
Well, Kingston, you're a wonder.

187
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,714
How you've been able to sail
with sour-belly Gaskell...

188
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,621
...as long as you have, I don't know.

189
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,284
- Jamesy.
- Well, Captain Gaskell.

190
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,761
I was just telling Kingston
how happy I was to be sailing with you.

191
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,559
Hey, stow that on the port side!

192
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,294
You still carry that cargo
of soft soap, eh, Jamesy?

193
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,938
I mean it.
You don't know what a safe feeling it is...

194
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:30,439
...to be sailing with a captain
that's never been raided by the pirates.

195
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:33,203
There's not much profit for pirates
in this zoo of yours.

196
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,370
Who are you swindling
with this scrubby lot?

197
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,948
That's the finest lot of animals
I've ever shipped.

198
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:41,553
Well, they're not as noisy as that last batch
of sopranos you had.

199
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,178
Just between you and me,
what do you give them to keep them quiet?

200
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,254
I give them one of these little pills.

201
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:50,623
They sleep and dream
all the way across, never lose a pound.

202
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:53,822
I don't suppose you thought of
giving them gravel to add a pound?

203
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,729
Why, captain, that would be dishonest.

204
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,831
They got big feet for
singsong girls, haven't they?

205
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,375
They don't bandage their feet nowadays.
These are enlightened days.

206
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,706
Those feet are big
even for enlightened days.

207
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,611
- Captain Gaskell...
- Mr. Rockwell, what does a woman do...

208
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:15,914
...when you throw something at her?
She dodges it. A man catches it.

209
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,452
Here, catch!

210
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,392
Sergeant of the Guard!

211
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:29,091
Charge them with attempted piracy.

212
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:32,101
Ask the police to wireless me
anything they sweat out of them.

213
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:37,199
Go ashore. Tell Moray
to bail them out before they start to talk.

214
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:42,143
Tell Ngah I'll go through with the job
as agreed, but he'll need more men. Go on.

215
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:51,015
Hey, captain, that's good work.
You're the finest skipper on this coast.

216
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,657
Thanks.

217
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,358
- Goodbye.
- See you on the next trip.

218
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:07,198
- Goodbye and thank you.
- Take care of yourself.

219
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,102
- I will.
- So long, Sybil. Good luck.

220
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,675
- Thank you so much.
- B-29.

221
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:14,540
- Don't forget to write, Sybil.
- I won't.

222
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,718
- Sybil.
- Alan.

223
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,390
It is Alan.

224
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,756
So this is your ship.
My, I am lucky.

225
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,758
Yes. Yes, I'm captain of this tub.

226
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,298
Are you visiting out here?

227
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:38,727
- Just traveling. You might start to unpack.
- Yes, miss.

228
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:41,372
I've been just traveling for some time.

229
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,367
I heard about Bart.

230
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:47,444
I meant to write,
but it was so long after he died.

231
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,944
News is slow out here.

232
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,483
We spoke of you so often,
wondering what you were doing.

233
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,813
Getting into trouble,
then trying to get out.

234
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:59,947
Well, you're in for more trouble now,
looking after me for a whole voyage.

235
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:03,058
I'm in your hands again, Alan.

236
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,858
Look here, Alan, can't you get this boat...?

237
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:13,937
What's wrong?
You look as if you'd seen a ghost.

238
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:16,437
I have.

239
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,480
Gangplank secure, sir.

240
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,650
All clear forward, sir.

241
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:28,719
Cast off your bow lines.

242
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:30,855
Aye, aye, sir.

243
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,662
Good morning, captain.

244
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,962
Hi, neighbor.
The name is Timmons.

245
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:42,362
I can take it or leave it alone.

246
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,230
No, no. The name: Timmons.
T-l-M-M-O-N-S.

247
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:48,100
And I'm the guy that can do it too.

248
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,612
Who is it?

249
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:10,018
- Who is it?
- It's just me, toots.

250
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,857
I told you to stay out of here.
I wasn't shadow-boxing. I meant it.

251
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,401
- I just came in to borrow a book.
- I don't keep them in my bathtub.

252
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,595
I decided to improve my mind.

253
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:24,334
You'd better take two books.
Give yourself an even break.

254
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,172
Now, do about three turns
around the deck before dinner...

255
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,007
...just to work up an appetite.

256
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,876
Okay. Okay, toots.

257
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,315
I know you ain't got much time
to fool around with passengers.

258
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:39,048
- It's your own fault. You wanted to be one.
- Except maybe that English dame.

259
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:43,160
- You're becoming very observant.
- I saw her when she came aboard.

260
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:46,092
She looked like she was smelling
a dead fish or something.

261
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,993
Considering her surroundings,
that's highly possible.

262
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:53,229
I also got a load of you
when you moved her into the royal suite.

263
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,873
Why didn't you lay out
a red plush carpet for her?

264
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,100
That's just a throwback
to my old manners.

265
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:01,303
The lady knew me when I acted that way
for the sheer joy of it.

266
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,277
Oh, I get it, a hometown honey.

267
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,277
I knew her years ago...

268
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,885
...and her husband.
- Married?

269
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:14,457
Being married don't seem
to tie her down none.

270
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:19,222
- He's dead.
- So she's back in circulation again.

271
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:24,597
Well, maybe it's a good thing you didn't
get hooked up with nobody out here.

272
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,574
Thanks.

273
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:33,242
If I'd had a more definite tie,
I might have behaved a bit more decently.

274
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:36,540
If you ain't decent, you'll do
until something decent comes along.

275
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,842
Out here, maybe.

276
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:43,112
But anywhere else in the world,
we'd both be a little bit soiled.

277
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,652
Did you ever see an English river?

278
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,290
No, I'm dumb at geography,
just like I am at everything else.

279
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,460
Well, it's cool, clear and clean.

280
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,631
Put a stream like that alongside
any river out here...

281
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,169
...dirty, yellow, muddy...

282
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,536
...you'll see the difference.

283
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:51,584
That was only a few years ago.

284
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,987
The pirates killed
every white person aboard...

285
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:57,253
...except the captain,
and then scuttled the ship.

286
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,865
Better take care of these pearls
in case of a piracy.

287
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,468
Why? They're artificial.
They're not worth anything.

288
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:05,898
Twelve and a half bucks.

289
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:09,005
A bargain, I'd say.
Where did you get them, Mr. Timmons?

290
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,870
- She picked them up...
- I bought them myself, in Tokyo.

291
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:15,636
Well, you know, it's not always easy
to tell the real from...

292
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:22,481
- I'm sure you didn't pay too much for them.
- Bet your sweet life she didn't.

293
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:26,750
That little woman gets her money's
worth every time, huh, poopsie?

294
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:30,657
Hey, you see that chess game over there?

295
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:36,267
When I was 4 years old,
I played 10 people all at once, blindfolded.

296
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,665
I lost every game.

297
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,373
Pirates. Baloney.

298
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:49,037
- Where did you really get those pearls, huh?
- You won't tell Wilbur, will you?

299
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:52,047
Twelve and a half bucks to Wilbur.

300
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:59,390
That pirate hooey of yours is stuff
they always tell tourists.

301
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:02,254
I'll bet they don't rate
1-9 with our rumrunners.

302
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:06,761
Bosh. Your rumrunners learned the game
from our pirates, even to hijacking.

303
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,729
That trick of identifying each other...

304
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,460
...by matching the
halves of a torn $ 100 bill.

305
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:15,038
- Here they use a £100 note.
- Sunday paper bunk.

306
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:21,007
- Hey, mate, come here.
- Yes, sir.

307
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:24,444
- How are you, Mr. Davids?
- How are you, Sir Guy?

308
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,414
Tell him that bunk about the ship
they held up and scuttled.

309
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:29,747
Get a load of this. It's terrific.

310
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,080
I don't remember saying anything,
Timmons.

311
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,020
You can't get out of it like that.

312
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:37,355
Tell him about the one white officer
who came out of it alive.

313
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,369
What's the matter with that boy?
Was I speaking out of turn?

314
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:49,473
I'm afraid you were. That's Tom Davids,
captain of the ship I was telling you about.

315
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:57,172
Say, don't look now, but I think
my stomach is full of butterflies.

316
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,074
Isabelle.

317
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:31,112
Isabelle MacCarthy.

318
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,581
- Yes?
- Would you say that I looked like a lady?

319
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:37,210
No, Miss Dolly. I been with you
all too long to insult you that way.

320
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:39,289
Say, what's the difference?

321
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,858
What's that snooty English dame got
that I ain't?

322
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,585
She's more refined-like.

323
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:46,822
She would never wear that dress
with all them shiny beads you got.

324
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:49,159
That dress is more my type.

325
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:52,770
You been hinting for that dress for a month.
Go on and take it.

326
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:55,406
You spoiled it for me, anyway.

327
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:05,974
You sure got the right feeling though,
honey.

328
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,786
I got to let this out a smidgen.

329
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:14,320
You sure is got the right instincts,
no matter what they all said.

330
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:15,755
What do they say?

331
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,121
It's just a mite of talk.
They say you's got yourself...

332
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:23,393
...so hooked onto that Captain Gaskell that
he's shaking himself like a wet hound-dog...

333
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,695
...and can't get you loose nohow.

334
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:28,396
Yes, miss, they do. Like a wet hound-dog.

335
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,973
He can't shake me off.
I hopped off, see?

336
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:34,977
And I'm glad I did.
Do you hear that? I'm glad. I'm happy.

337
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:39,015
Sure you is happy, honey.
But don't you worry. You'll get over it.

338
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:01,872
Twenty years on the China Seas,
and she never lost a spangle.

339
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:07,370
I had a spangle once,
it was a cocker-spangle.

340
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,605
She had a litter of field mice.

341
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:16,419
Good evening, Miss Portland.
I've got you the other side of Mr. MacArdle.

342
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:21,252
- Well, I get it. Where is the big guy?
- You mean the captain, miss?

343
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:24,088
He went... That is,
I believe he's escorting Mrs. Barclay.

344
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:27,231
Why doesn't she put a ring in
his nose to lead him around easier?

345
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:28,798
- Excuse me, sir.
- Ah Feng...

346
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,401
...bring me a double hooker of scotch.
- Yes, miss.

347
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,835
Well, Jamesy, you old tramp.
Long time no see, kid.

348
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:37,941
No fault of mine, Dolly.
You're the original one-man girl.

349
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,168
As long as I've got a one-gal guy.

350
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:45,146
I just saw Captain Gaskell upstairs
walking with Mrs. Barclay.

351
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,150
Very lovely-looking girl, isn't she?

352
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:51,688
She couldn't take me away
from a girl like you in 1000 years.

353
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:55,691
What makes you think
she's taking anything away from me, huh?

354
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:58,887
Get on the belt line
and keep them coming.

355
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:10,700
You know everybody, Sybil,
except perhaps Miss Yu-Lan, Mrs. Barclay.

356
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,969
- How do you do?
- And Miss Portland.

357
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:15,203
- How do you do?
- Hello.

358
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,905
You needn't be so
confoundedly possessive, Alan.

359
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,017
I knew Mrs. Barclay long before you did.

360
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,619
You had such a start.
I'm only trying to catch up.

361
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:25,722
You had your chance, Sir Guy,
but you spurned me.

362
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:28,382
At least Alan didn't meet me
till after I was married.

363
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,528
That ruins all my guesses.

364
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:33,186
I had such a romantic meeting arranged
for you two.

365
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:37,802
Squadron ball at Gibraltar.
Music, lanterns, uniforms.

366
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,334
Her husband was at sea,
so I claimed every dance.

367
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:42,302
We walked back to the hotel together.

368
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:45,466
- With or without moonlight?
- There was a harvest moon.

369
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:48,477
You've never seen a moon
until you watch one over China Seas.

370
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:51,616
- It'll be full when we get to Singapore.
- Oh, glorious.

371
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:53,910
Speaking of meetings,
remember that night...

372
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:57,543
...in that poo-tang joint in Saigon
when we met up with a certain party?

373
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,417
- Do I?
- There wasn't any moon.

374
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:02,025
He had a shiner that lit up the whole street.

375
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:05,594
And a cut on his leg. He'd have bled
to death if it hadn't been for Dolly.

376
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:09,560
- Oh, my, that was a romantic meeting.
- She saved his life.

377
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,634
Never got a word of thanks,
I'll be bound.

378
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:13,770
I wish I could tell you what she said.

379
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:17,375
You never used to be so particular
about your language.

380
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,876
That's right, Dolly.

381
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:23,414
This'll be an awful comedown
after the Royal Mail.

382
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:27,780
I don't know. There's something very
real and dramatic about this atmosphere.

383
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:30,421
You know, pirates and machine guns,
barricades...

384
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,683
Mr. McCaleb, I want you to meet
a literary rival, Mrs. Barclay.

385
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,086
Good evening, Mr. McCaleb.

386
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,320
Thanks,
I've got all the insurance I can handle.

387
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:43,896
Mrs. Barclay, I'm sure I saw you
in London two years ago.

388
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,696
Why, of course, Miss Yu-Lan.

389
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:49,271
It was at the American Embassy,
and then at the Gainsboroughs' in Sussex.

390
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,636
Peg Gainsborough
is the most amazing hostess.

391
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,904
- It was only two years before that I met...
- Too amazing for words.

392
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:58,238
There I was with a cinder in me eye
as large as a paving block...

393
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:00,577
...the duke on one side,
marquis on the other...

394
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:04,688
...both trying to pull my
top lid over my bottom.

395
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:13,863
- Miss Portland is a professional entertainer.
- Oh, I am.

396
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:18,230
- You'd like me to try something else?
- You haven't anything left for an encore.

397
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:22,703
So you think it's funny?
What are you grinning at?

398
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:26,901
- You must be very fond of him.
- What makes you think so?

399
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,438
To humiliate yourself like this.

400
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,343
I'll see you later, Alan.

401
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:37,484
Don't worry, he knows where
the royal suite is, and so do I!

402
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,783
I had it the first time I sailed
on this ship.

403
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,984
The more violent the storm,
the sooner it subsides.

404
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:46,653
When I want you to sound off,
Golden Bells, I'll pull your rope.

405
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:50,426
I apologize for this exhibition.
It's all my fault.

406
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:55,931
And as the man said when they were about
to hang him, ''This will be a lesson to me.''

407
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:02,310
Madam Chairman and ladies
of this literary group...

408
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:06,912
...it is with sentiments of profound
respect that I address you this afternoon...

409
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:12,182
...because woman is the mother
of all literature. I thank you.

410
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,060
Hey, look, I'm awful sorry I blew up,
honest I am.

411
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:19,890
Hookers of Scotch and the fact
I'm so nuts about you, l...

412
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:21,464
You saved me a lot of trouble.

413
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:25,364
You painted the whole dirty picture
for her with a nice truthful brush. Thanks.

414
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:29,405
Toots, don't talk to me like that.
I get scared when you put the freeze on me.

415
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:31,542
I'll go apologize,
do anything you want...

416
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:36,113
You keep as far away from her as you can,
and farther away from me.

417
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:52,893
Come.

418
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,332
- Captain Gaskell, sir.
- What's wrong, Mr. Rockwell?

419
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:58,401
This navigation chart...

420
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,794
Excuse me, sir.

421
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:03,440
This navigation problem.
I'm having trouble with it.

422
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:05,667
- Trouble?
- Yes, sir.

423
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,669
Yes, I should say you are.

424
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:11,373
If your figures are correct, this ship's
in the middle of the Sahara Desert.

425
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:14,712
- Yes, sir. It has me worried, sir.
- Yes.

426
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:17,480
Well, suppose you try adding here
instead of subtracting.

427
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:20,123
Perhaps that will put us back
in the ocean again.

428
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:22,191
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

429
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,420
- All right.
- Excuse me, sir.

430
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:33,459
How's it, toots? Well, go on
and play dumb if you want to.

431
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:37,472
I just came in to tell you I'm not gonna
come around and pester you anymore.

432
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,140
Look...

433
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:42,009
...l'm taking all my cigarettes.

434
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:48,611
You know, it's moonlight outside.
Gee, it's pretty.

435
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,414
Ain't it funny we always fight
when it's moonlight...

436
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,887
...and make up when it's raining?

437
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:57,790
It's about time for the rainy season,
ain't it, toots?

438
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:02,724
Come on out of the trenches, I'm not
gonna throw any bombs. I'm harmless.

439
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:06,200
Yes, of course,
you're as harmless as a revolution.

440
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:09,502
Well, don't forget your cigarettes.

441
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:12,507
I won't.
I know an exit line when I hear one.

442
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:16,204
Well, anyway, it won't be so lonely
while Jamesy's aboard.

443
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,379
I hate to hear you talk like that.

444
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,075
A gal's got to do the best
she can with what's around.

445
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:22,742
You owe yourself more than that.

446
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:26,015
The trouble is, boyfriend,
there ain't any male Mrs. Barclays...

447
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:28,455
...so charming, so refine.

448
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:32,893
The real trouble is,
there aren't enough female Mrs. Barclays.

449
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:50,574
Don't give it another thought, Alan.

450
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:55,016
I once hoped you'd know me very well,
but not that well.

451
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:59,486
But when you once hoped,
you weren't in this part of the world.

452
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:03,093
No, that's true. But here I am.

453
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:07,962
- Yes.
- Captain Gaskell...

454
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:11,260
...Mr. MacArdle wants to go forward
to look after his animals.

455
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,404
No. MacArdle can't look at his animals.

456
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:16,267
I wouldn't let an admiral go forward
without a guard.

457
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:20,805
- You find it an exciting part of the world.
- Exciting?

458
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:23,675
Nursing leftovers
who are supposed to be officers?

459
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:25,782
Derelicts for a crew?

460
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,577
- But ashore, the glamour of...
- Yes.

461
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:31,688
You saw me this morning after a trip
ashore. Did I look particularly glamorous?

462
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:34,416
Well, I wasn't thinking of background.

463
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:37,150
That girl, she's glamorous, surely.

464
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:42,299
Sybil, I don't deny her.
But you know why I came out here.

465
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:45,664
Why I resigned from the service.
It was all I could do.

466
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:47,664
Yes, we...

467
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:51,265
I might have cracked up Bart's life
if you'd stayed.

468
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:53,271
Sybil.

469
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:58,211
If I thought
there was the slightest chance...

470
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:00,746
...l'd stumble out with everything...

471
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,787
...I wanted to say six years ago.
- Alan, I have a confession to make.

472
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:06,253
I'm not just traveling.

473
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,951
I've followed a memory, traced you here.
And now that I've found you...

474
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:12,153
...I don't care how you've lived.

475
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:15,463
I'll always be in love with you.

476
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,927
I'll jump ship at Singapore.

477
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,869
- We'll dig up a magistrate or a chaplain...
- A Buddhist monk.

478
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,101
- We'll go back together.
- Oh, England.

479
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,609
I've a place with a fireplace
you can stand in.

480
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,944
- Your cocoa, sir.
- Oh, yes. Come in, old man. Come right in.

481
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:35,149
What's the matter?
What happened to you?

482
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,983
The chef's been at the vanilla extract
again, sir. Went for me with a cleaver.

483
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:41,148
- The cleaver's a new matter, sir.
- Oh, yes.

484
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:43,726
Give him a brandy.
He'll be all right in the morning.

485
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:48,559
Sybil, I want you to meet the best
chief steward in the line, Ted Geary.

486
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:51,257
Honest as the day is long.

487
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:56,496
And he said to Mrs. Barclay
I was the best steward in the line.

488
00:32:56,674 --> 00:33:00,872
''Honest as the day is long.'' Never a word
about the last bottle of whiskey I pinched.

489
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:02,672
No doubt, the old man's going soft.

490
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:04,906
Relieved my watch
so I could have breakfast.

491
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,847
- Called me ''Bertie.''
- I had a chew of tobacco in my mouth...

492
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:12,115
...as big as that. He never even noticed it.
- He said he'd take me to the races ashore.

493
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:18,954
That's the way it is with those
two-bottle men. I've never seen it fail.

494
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:22,759
- All of a sudden...
- I knew a man once in Liverpool who...

495
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,036
Davids.

496
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:39,982
- Aren't you going to wait for your coffee?
- No.

497
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:44,110
- It's too stuffy here.
- And smelly too.

498
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:56,695
May I please have the sugar, sir?

499
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:03,773
Thank you.

500
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,304
Mark.

501
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:14,841
- Good.
- Lovely shot.

502
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:19,784
That's a lovely gun. I hope that they don't
leave them laying around loose.

503
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:21,948
Captain lock them up
all the time we no use.

504
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:24,253
- That's good.
- Mark.

505
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,330
- Hi.
- Good morning.

506
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:30,058
- Good morning.
- Oh, good morning.

507
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:35,936
I guess she's still burned.

508
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:37,602
Mark.

509
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:41,210
I got it that time.

510
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:44,746
- I'm afraid you're too consistent for me.
- Not at all.

511
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:48,348
Mark.

512
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:53,385
I received your note.
Really wasn't necessary.

513
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:55,753
I'm sorry I acted so crazy.

514
00:34:56,828 --> 00:35:00,662
Jamesy, how about you and me starting
a little competition for the common people?

515
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:03,392
- All right. I'll bet you a shilling.
- Okay.

516
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:05,229
Bring us a gun.

517
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:07,668
There you are.

518
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,240
Will you and Captain Gaskell make
your home in Singapore or Hong Kong?

519
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,570
I don't think we'll stay out here at all.

520
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:15,177
Did you hear what she said?

521
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:19,180
It's all over the ship that they'll get married
the minute they get into Singapore.

522
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:23,410
- That's why Gaskell's turned sunny-side up.
- Mark.

523
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:28,452
I think you're very wise not to stay in
the Orient. We have a saying out here:

524
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:33,290
''After the cheap, strong wine,
the most delicate tea has little flavor.''

525
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:36,126
- Be careful.
- Oh, I'm sorry. L...

526
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,167
Quite all right.
You had no idea the gun was loaded.

527
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:43,005
You don't think I pointed it at you
on purpose, do you?

528
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:45,568
There's nothing to think about,
Miss Portland.

529
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:49,304
The gestures of a woman like you
simply do not exist.

530
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,845
Mark.

531
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:56,119
It's beautiful the way these ducks
know how to throw the old harpoon.

532
00:35:56,287 --> 00:36:00,383
That's one of the advantages of
a very fine cosmopolitan education.

533
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:03,356
Come on, Jamesy,
let's you and me take a powder.

534
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:08,031
Clay pigeons.

535
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:12,761
That's the thrilling sort of life
you're headed for in England, Alan...

536
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:15,701
...shooting clay pigeons.

537
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:21,138
Exactly. And whether you believe it or not,
I'll revel in it.

538
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:25,282
Greetings, boyfriend.

539
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:28,612
Well, I understand congratulations
are in order.

540
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:31,584
I'd like to be the first to wish you
the best.

541
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:33,348
You'll need it.

542
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,819
Someday you'll say something nice
and never forgive yourself.

543
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:40,958
Look, toots, l...

544
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:44,829
Gee, I don't blame you for being sore.
I know I've done a lot of stupid gabbing.

545
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:47,368
But this is on the level.
I wish you all the luck.

546
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:52,100
That's one baby you'll never be ashamed of.
She's the real McCoy, and she'll make...

547
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:54,836
...a marvelous wife for you.

548
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:00,048
- I wish you meant that.
- I do.

549
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,479
Well, that's better.

550
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:09,388
Now, let's quit good friends instead of a
couple of cab drivers after a drunken brawl.

551
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,585
I guess that's the way
it ought to be done.

552
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:15,163
But I ain't been brought up to do
the right thing like that English dame.

553
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,233
All I can say
is what's down inside of me.

554
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,733
I don't care how long
you've been carrying a torch.

555
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,566
You can't quit me anymore
than I can quit you.

556
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,800
And you can kiss
a stack of cookbooks on that!

557
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,020
Thank you.

558
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:44,491
Well, anyway,
it'll be quieter in England.

559
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:47,961
- Wait till you get there, if you ever do.
- What's to keep me?

560
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:53,593
Well, I've been trying it for 30 years,
but there's something about this place.

561
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:58,138
From my windows, I can see
the whole harbor of Hong Kong.

562
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,834
Big ships coming, big ships going.

563
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:04,504
The China I know,
the China I've helped to make.

564
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:09,813
On quiet nights, off in the hills,
I can hear the sound of distant firing.

565
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:13,718
They were at it when I came,
and they'll be at it after I've gone.

566
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:16,883
More guns won't stop them,
too many of them.

567
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:21,361
And the only things they respect
are courage and honor.

568
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:23,261
Yes, and England's power.

569
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:26,995
England's place here can never be any
greater than the men who represent her.

570
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:29,833
They might be able to use
an Englishman at home sometime.

571
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:34,068
I was hoping someday you'd take my place.
I had me eye on you for a long time.

572
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:37,612
Take it off.
I'm quitting as soon as we dock.

573
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:42,048
- Of course, if you're in earnest...
- Dead earnest.

574
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:46,246
I'd better be looking for
somebody to take your command, eh?

575
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,656
What about Dawson?

576
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:54,554
- Dawson? Take my ship?
- I've always heard you speak highly of him.

577
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:58,899
Yes. Yes, of course,
I speak highly of him.

578
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,862
Dawson's one of the best.

579
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:07,168
Absolutely. You couldn't do better.

580
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:09,536
Dawson.

581
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:19,851
I never forget a name or a face.
Now, I've seen you somewhere before.

582
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,357
- You've seen me a dozen times a day since...
- Now, don't tell me.

583
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,222
It's on the tip of my tongue.

584
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:30,028
The name is Timmons.
T-l-M-M-O-N-S.

585
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:32,334
How do you pronounce it?

586
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:37,807
Timmons! Timmons! Timmons!
T-l-M-M...

587
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:44,078
I thought he said ''Timmons.''

588
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,250
My compliments to Mr. Dawson.

589
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:53,754
- Tell him I'll be up on the bridge shortly.
- I drink to the health of Admiral Puff.

590
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:56,586
Are you good, Jamesy!

591
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,385
Attaboy, Jamesy.

592
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:00,697
- Did you call, sir?
- What?

593
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:04,232
See that all staterooms and portholes
are secured. We're in for a blow.

594
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,098
Will it be a real storm, Alan,
and terrifying?

595
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:09,034
Oh, seasonal.
I can't tell much more.

596
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:11,367
I did hope, for your sake,
it'd be an easy trip.

597
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:13,703
That's too much to expect
from the China Seas.

598
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:15,368
Attaboy!

599
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:17,746
Anything else, sir?

600
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:22,476
What? Yes, you might tell them that
anybody that can't hold his or her liquor...

601
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:25,121
...better lay off till this blow is over.

602
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:30,227
I'm afraid you're a good influence on him,
Sybil, and I deplore it.

603
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:33,119
- All right, here we go again.
- I beg your pardon...

604
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:37,666
Here's to the health
of Admiral Puff, Puff, Puff, three times.

605
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:50,474
- Okay?
- Perfect.

606
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,548
I think you did one bounce too many.

607
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:56,277
She was all right.
I had my eye on her just like a hawk.

608
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:58,613
Dear fellow, what do you suppose
I was doing?

609
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:02,816
- That's two against one. Two against one.
- Captain says the weather's blowing up.

610
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:04,119
A word to the wise.

611
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:08,388
Tell him to look out for women
and children first.

612
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,391
Come on, Jamesy, we're off again.

613
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:13,969
Greatest game in the world that makes
man remember and woman forget.

614
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:19,371
I'll play this game until you can't
remember anything but your little Jamesy.

615
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:22,604
Here's to the health of Admiral Puff,
three times.

616
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,544
Oh, keeno. You forgot to say
''Admiral Puff, Puff, Puff.''

617
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:30,244
- Doggone it, anyway, l...
- Drink up, sir, and start all over again.

618
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:32,753
Come on, down the hatch.

619
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:37,292
Don't look so sad, toots.
You're doing swell.

620
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:42,795
Ever noticed, Sir Guy, that a man is never
angry with a woman he doesn't like?

621
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,197
I had not, until now.

622
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:48,634
Me either. And I shall be more pleasant
to her after this.

623
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:51,197
Shall we?

624
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,878
Good evening, skipper.

625
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:58,844
How's the barometer doing?

626
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,712
- Falling to a new low.
- Don't let that worry you, captain.

627
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:04,116
Where have you been
keeping yourself, stranger?

628
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:06,586
Have breakfast with me in the morning...

629
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:10,659
...if you can eat anything.
- I'll be there. Nothing takes my appetite.

630
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:13,160
Say, how about joining the game.
It kills all care.

631
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,355
I'm afraid it would kill me too.
Good night.

632
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:19,495
Kill nothing. All you need is a wooden,
hollow leg to play this game.

633
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,366
Here's to the health of Admiral...

634
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:25,639
- Prosit.
- Prosit.

635
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:31,271
Missed out again, Jamesy.
Sock it down, boy.

636
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:44,191
It's thickening like mud.
We're running into it.

637
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:47,194
Running into it? We're in it already.

638
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:51,565
Why don't you keep her on course. Are you
trying to write your name in the ocean?

639
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:56,867
Old man's getting back to normal.
Good thing, with this coming on.

640
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,565
Oilskins on. Get to your station.

641
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,767
- Stick her nose right into it.
- Yes, sir.

642
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:04,039
Tell the steward to look to his
passengers. Get lifebelts on them.

643
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:07,706
- Yes, sir.
- Exciting, sir, isn't it? My first typhoon.

644
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:11,821
Really? Well, if you live long enough,
you may see another one sometime.

645
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:13,354
- To your station!
- Yes, sir.

646
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:15,583
Excuse me, sir.

647
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,036
Chief, keep up a full head of steam.
We're in for a twister.

648
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:49,389
Good old Grandfather.

649
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:18,081
Don't get panicky, just stick by me.

650
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:54,889
Hey, stop showing off!
Come on up here.

651
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:08,337
Come on, lady, slip into this.

652
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:11,497
- I really shouldn't, with my figure.
- Tie it up the front.

653
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:13,142
Let me help you, miss.

654
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:16,507
- You've lost your pearls.
- I broke the string. Mr. Romanoff has them.

655
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,240
Yes, I will restring them
as soon as we get out of this.

656
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:22,817
I never want to see them again.
Throw them away. Do anything you please.

657
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:24,783
If we only come out of this alive.

658
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:28,891
Now, now, poopsie, don't let a
little wind blow you off your feet.

659
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:35,354
- Have you seen Miss Portland, sir?
- Isn't she in her cabin?

660
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:37,796
If she went out in the condition she was in...

661
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:40,869
You all don't suppose
she's been washed overboard?

662
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:53,639
Can't find Miss Portland, sir. Afraid
she may have been washed overboard.

663
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:55,808
- Keep your head into it!
- Aye.

664
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:58,011
- Where's MacArdle?
- His door was locked, sir.

665
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:01,351
- Why didn't you break it down?
- I was afraid to without orders.

666
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:24,846
That's the game, you old beachcomber.
I beat you. Do you hear that? I won.

667
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:27,608
Prosit.

668
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:33,989
Hey, that's a typhoon.
That's a typhoon, Jamesy.

669
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:37,491
Come on, give me the 20 you owe me.
Come on.

670
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:41,993
Now, quit stalling, Jamesy,
and give me that 20 you owe me.

671
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:45,666
All right, if you won't give it to me,
I'll take it.

672
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:31,376
What a twister that was.

673
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,215
Hello, Dolly.

674
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:41,948
- Well, where are you going?
- Winners always go home, don't they?

675
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:44,685
What's the idea of locking the door?
Caveman stuff, huh?

676
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,296
No, it's just a force of habit, Dolly.

677
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:51,025
You trying to insult me? Did I ever
take anything that wasn't coming to me?

678
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:56,366
Why, darling, you know that you could
have anything that I've got, anytime.

679
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:07,509
Now, come on, you, fork that over.

680
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:11,245
All right, well, sure, there's £200
that I won, and won on the level.

681
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:14,015
- Lf you ain't a good enough sport...
- No, you don't.

682
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:16,625
You know what I'm talking about.

683
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:18,624
You know what I mean.

684
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:22,054
I know it's pretty stormy out there...

685
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:24,666
...and you never know
when you might wash overboard.

686
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:26,598
- Are you threatening me?
- You seen it.

687
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:29,102
I haven't. I don't know
what you're talking about.

688
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:32,868
I'm talking about that half of the
£100 note you just took out of my wallet.

689
00:48:33,043 --> 00:48:35,443
I don't know what you're saying,
but I'll forget it.

690
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:37,603
It would do you no good
to double-cross me.

691
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:40,545
- This is a hanging matter.
- I don't wanna hear another word.

692
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:44,380
If it was anybody else but you,
I'd chuck you overboard.

693
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:48,515
I'm so crazy about you
it's eating my insides out.

694
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:50,421
- You're in with me.
- I don't wanna be.

695
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:54,496
You're in with me. There's a quarter
of a million pounds of gold on this ship.

696
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:58,362
Your share will make you a rich woman.
We can go anywhere, do anything.

697
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:02,665
- I'm no good. What do you want?
- You're smart enough to hide that note.

698
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:06,070
- Smart enough to know what it means.
- Smart enough to stay out of it!

699
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:09,508
Even as much as I love you,
you're in with me from now on, or else...

700
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:14,083
...l'm going to break
that pretty little neck of yours just like...

701
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:21,185
- The Marines have landed.
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

702
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:25,658
We were sealing a little partnership which
I hope she'll never have cause to regret.

703
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:29,094
You better do your sealing in the
main salon where there's witnesses.

704
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:31,291
Maybe you're right, captain.

705
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:57,854
Look out!

706
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,628
- Hold her.
- That was a narrow thing, Alan.

707
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:08,068
Collins!

708
00:50:08,572 --> 00:50:12,838
- Get some lines, lash this down.
- Come here with that line. Hey, come here.

709
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:22,608
- Cold, darling?
- Yeah, cold, that's it.

710
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:25,944
You with me?

711
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:30,014
- That's a tough ocean to try and swim in.
- That's a good girl.

712
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:33,026
Now, you keep miles away
from that fella Gaskell...

713
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:36,495
...or I might think that you're trying
to double-cross me.

714
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,245
Captain Gaskell,
the steamroller's loose, sir.

715
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:59,019
- It'll mash those coolies like a lot of turnips.
- Oh, the poor devils.

716
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:15,201
Let it go overboard!

717
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,718
Come on!

718
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:38,693
Close up that rail!

719
00:51:49,206 --> 00:51:51,367
Davids, lend a hand!

720
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:24,600
Go on, pop those winches!

721
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,780
All right, turn on the steam!

722
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:33,542
Go to your quarters!
You're under arrest.

723
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:21,986
- Well, what do you want?
- I want to thank you, sir, for saving my life.

724
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:24,692
Go to bed.

725
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:27,091
- Is it all over, sir?
- Yeah.

726
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,789
We'll stand regular watch from now on.

727
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:38,304
Mr. Kingston,
what time do you come on watch?

728
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:40,375
- Eight bells.
- You're one minute late.

729
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:42,170
I'm sorry, sir.

730
00:54:42,345 --> 00:54:46,281
- Keep her at half for repairs on the engine.
- Aye, aye, sir.

731
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:49,150
Davids is here, sir.

732
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:52,649
Yeah, all right.

733
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:56,155
I know what I'd do with him
if this was my ship.

734
00:54:56,826 --> 00:54:59,124
Well, wait till you get a ship.

735
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:03,657
Mr. Davids.

736
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:10,734
Yes, sir.

737
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:15,867
For the rest of the voyage, you're relieved
of duty, confined to your quarters in arrest.

738
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:21,313
We reach port, I turn you in to the Board
of Trade for neglect and disobedience.

739
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:23,611
I don't blame you, sir.

740
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:27,484
But it's funny, during the year I've been
on the beach, I've prayed every day...

741
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:32,754
...for a chance. And then when I got it,
I couldn't make good.

742
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:36,596
I'm just a washout, that's all.

743
00:55:40,103 --> 00:55:42,003
I'm sorry, Davids.

744
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:45,441
- Call me when you relieve the watch.
- Yes, sir.

745
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:51,808
This will cost you your ticket.

746
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,799
It's me. I've been waiting for you.

747
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:21,569
- Get out of here.
- I got a good reason for being here.

748
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:24,145
You've always got a good reason
for anything you do.

749
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:27,044
I don't know anybody who can think up
more good reasons...

750
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:30,482
...than you can on short notice.
- I took an awful chance coming here.

751
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:33,315
- I might've got heaved overboard.
- Don't run anymore risk.

752
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:36,891
- Get off on the rest of your rounds.
- Listen, I came here for one thing...

753
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,857
I'm quite aware of that.

754
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:41,189
You're always waiting
for a sailor to comfort.

755
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:45,926
Only a woman like you can comfort a man
who's too tired or drunk to care who it is.

756
00:56:46,102 --> 00:56:48,627
Don't be like that.
You're gonna talk yourself right...

757
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:50,830
I hope so!

758
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:57,037
Oh, you hope so, do you?

759
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:59,909
Well, you've been begging for it,
now you're gonna get it.

760
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,711
You won't be high and mighty
when I get through with you.

761
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:06,822
You wait, I'll fix you. You'll be lower
than a coolie. You'll be lower than Davids.

762
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:09,925
You'll come crawling to me
on your knees!

763
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:21,235
I warned you not to double-cross me.

764
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:29,668
You said you could use the guns.

765
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:37,147
Well, darling, you're a marvel.

766
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,346
You're a real partner.
You know, I thought you was going...

767
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:45,051
What does it matter what you thought I was
gonna do? You got what you wanted.

768
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:47,594
Don't take it so hard, darling.

769
00:57:47,764 --> 00:57:51,029
Take what too hard?
I got what I wanted too.

770
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:55,299
I guess.

771
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:26,705
Help!

772
00:58:31,984 --> 00:58:34,145
Sparks. Sparks!

773
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:37,288
Look out, sir, Malays.

774
00:59:41,219 --> 00:59:42,948
Don't shoot.

775
00:59:47,392 --> 00:59:49,087
Here they come.

776
00:59:49,861 --> 00:59:52,421
Look, they're bringing them all in now.

777
00:59:54,366 --> 00:59:56,960
They've scuttled ships, you know, before.

778
00:59:57,235 --> 00:59:58,702
What are they doing?

779
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:00,929
Got a cigarette, Jamesy?

780
01:00:04,076 --> 01:00:06,544
I thought you said nobody'd get hurt.

781
01:00:06,712 --> 01:00:10,773
You can't expect the boys to stand there,
take it after someone cuts loose at them.

782
01:00:10,949 --> 01:00:14,282
I must have been crazy. Stark, staring crazy.

783
01:00:14,453 --> 01:00:17,115
Take it easy. Take it easy.

784
01:00:17,756 --> 01:00:19,451
Be careful.

785
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:33,736
Why hide those pearls?
They're not worth anything.

786
01:00:33,905 --> 01:00:36,032
- I don't wanna lose them.
- You're right.

787
01:00:36,208 --> 01:00:39,700
I've been through one of these things
before. They take everything in sight.

788
01:00:39,878 --> 01:00:43,314
Something funny about those. I'll
appraise them when we get to Singapore.

789
01:00:43,482 --> 01:00:44,972
Wilbur, don't be insane.

790
01:00:57,396 --> 01:01:00,024
Every one of those guns
came out of our arsenal.

791
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:01,688
- Our arsenal, sir?
- Yes.

792
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:04,802
I don't see how they could have
broken down that steel door.

793
01:01:18,917 --> 01:01:21,442
- Davids.
- Yes, Dawson.

794
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:32,996
No savvy Malay. Do you?

795
01:01:33,165 --> 01:01:36,726
- Not enough. But MacArdle does, I'm sure.
- Look here.

796
01:01:36,902 --> 01:01:39,666
- Don't any of you fellas speak English?
- No savvy.

797
01:01:39,938 --> 01:01:44,170
Now, isn't that just too bad.
Oh, that's terrible. Yes.

798
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:48,175
Look here, whoever you are
in that lifeboat out there...

799
01:01:48,346 --> 01:01:51,838
...there are some Mills bombs
in the seat locker in my quarters.

800
01:01:52,017 --> 01:01:56,010
If you're not too badly hurt,
watch your chance and try and get them.

801
01:01:56,188 --> 01:02:00,147
- I'll hold them here as long as I can.
- No savvy.

802
01:02:00,325 --> 01:02:01,917
No savvy?

803
01:02:03,662 --> 01:02:06,563
There is your chance, Mr. Dawson.

804
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:11,260
- Get those bombs.
- He's crazy.

805
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:15,634
- What's the use? I'd only be shot.
- Yes.

806
01:02:15,907 --> 01:02:18,899
I understand, Mr. Dawson.

807
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,580
Get out of my way.

808
01:02:39,764 --> 01:02:42,858
As far as I can make out,
he comes from a very royal family...

809
01:02:43,034 --> 01:02:47,061
...and is very sorry to disturb you like this.

810
01:02:47,239 --> 01:02:49,400
Why, no disturbance at all.

811
01:02:49,574 --> 01:02:52,907
He wishes to assure you
that no one will be harmed...

812
01:02:53,078 --> 01:02:55,410
...if you will open the strongbox.

813
01:02:55,580 --> 01:03:01,041
He will willingly take the gold and depart
with only friendly feelings toward you.

814
01:03:02,954 --> 01:03:05,514
- Open the safe.
- Yes, sir.

815
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:10,719
You haven't lost your ticket yet, old man.

816
01:03:10,896 --> 01:03:14,764
If you want me to, I'll be only
too glad to put in a good word for you.

817
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:07,982
Where's Alan?
You don't think they'll hurt him?

818
01:04:08,153 --> 01:04:13,113
No, no. Of course not, my dear. No.
No, they need the captain healthy.

819
01:04:36,214 --> 01:04:40,344
I'm sorry, poopsie. Looks like
that guy did the appraising.

820
01:04:49,294 --> 01:04:52,786
Why, that's sand.
You're pretty smart, Gaskell.

821
01:04:52,964 --> 01:04:56,627
Well, apparently,
the bank patronized some other line.

822
01:04:56,801 --> 01:05:00,293
You can't fool these Malays
with an old trick like the boxes of sand.

823
01:05:00,472 --> 01:05:04,499
Whoever heads this gang's got brains.
They know when there's gold aboard a ship.

824
01:05:04,676 --> 01:05:09,136
Their spies tell them about every shipment
of gold that leaves any bank in Hong Kong.

825
01:05:09,314 --> 01:05:12,511
Make it clear to him. If there was
any gold aboard, he could have it.

826
01:05:12,684 --> 01:05:15,983
Listen, man, I'm talking to you
as though I'm your own brother.

827
01:05:16,154 --> 01:05:18,816
Save yourself while there's still time.

828
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:23,954
Look here, that's my skipper. You can't...

829
01:05:25,363 --> 01:05:28,025
Looks as if the pardon came too late.

830
01:05:28,199 --> 01:05:32,295
Why, it's the boot, the
Malay boot. Why, that's cruel torture.

831
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:33,801
The size is 9-C.

832
01:05:33,972 --> 01:05:37,772
- You're not going to let them torture you.
- Have you any suggestions?

833
01:06:05,036 --> 01:06:06,469
Is that the latest style?

834
01:06:06,638 --> 01:06:09,732
Don't let him do that.
You'll never be able to use your foot again.

835
01:06:09,908 --> 01:06:13,503
Listen, you're as fast a talker as anyone.
Tell him something, anything.

836
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:16,010
Tell him the bank
fooled me as much as it did him.

837
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:18,809
I've talked my head off, he won't listen.

838
01:06:20,919 --> 01:06:25,754
Tell them where it is. It's killing me to
stand here and not be able to help you.

839
01:06:25,924 --> 01:06:29,325
- I can't bear it.
- Put your fingers in your ears.

840
01:06:47,612 --> 01:06:49,842
Stubborn half-wit.

841
01:07:09,434 --> 01:07:12,528
Gaskell, my boy. Gaskell.

842
01:07:12,704 --> 01:07:14,604
Don't start counting, I'm getting up.

843
01:07:14,773 --> 01:07:17,367
Please tell them where it is, Gaskell.

844
01:07:17,542 --> 01:07:21,672
Why, it's breaking my heart
to see you suffer like this.

845
01:07:49,674 --> 01:07:53,075
There can't be any gold.
You would have talked.

846
01:07:53,244 --> 01:07:55,769
Nobody could be that tough.

847
01:07:56,481 --> 01:08:00,008
Clew out. Come on, clew out.

848
01:08:26,711 --> 01:08:28,906
You poor boy, you.

849
01:08:29,113 --> 01:08:31,274
I made them understand
there's no gold here.

850
01:08:31,449 --> 01:08:34,043
It was Jamesy that saved
your poor feet for you.

851
01:08:34,219 --> 01:08:38,383
- Have they gone?
- It's all right. They're getting into the junk.

852
01:08:38,790 --> 01:08:42,920
Here, take it easy.
There's nothing you can do. Here, Gaskell.

853
01:09:10,188 --> 01:09:11,416
Davids.

854
01:09:15,827 --> 01:09:16,919
- Davids!
- Davids!

855
01:09:17,095 --> 01:09:18,357
Shut your mouth.

856
01:09:21,165 --> 01:09:23,725
- I got the bombs.
- Good, good. Let me have this one.

857
01:09:23,902 --> 01:09:26,393
Keep clear till I blow my way out.

858
01:09:27,205 --> 01:09:30,231
Thanks, Davids. Can you heave
the rest of them into that junk?

859
01:09:30,408 --> 01:09:32,035
I'll try.

860
01:09:34,245 --> 01:09:38,739
Davids, remember, after you pull the pin,
you only got five seconds until it goes off.

861
01:09:41,286 --> 01:09:44,483
- You're crazy. You'll get us all killed.
- Get back!

862
01:09:59,804 --> 01:10:01,328
One...

863
01:10:01,706 --> 01:10:05,472
...two, three, four...

864
01:10:45,516 --> 01:10:49,213
Hey, a little less noise, please.

865
01:11:04,068 --> 01:11:05,968
Captain Gaskell?

866
01:11:07,705 --> 01:11:10,469
- What did you find?
- Not even a scratch on the door, sir.

867
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:13,405
The arsenal must have
been opened with a key.

868
01:11:15,513 --> 01:11:18,277
Tell the steward to bring
MacArdle and Portland to my cabin.

869
01:11:21,519 --> 01:11:24,511
Listen, Dolly, where did you
put that half £100 note?

870
01:11:24,689 --> 01:11:26,350
- I know it's safe, but l...
- I hid it.

871
01:11:26,524 --> 01:11:29,516
- Where?
- In Gaskell's cabin, in a tin of cigarettes.

872
01:11:29,694 --> 01:11:32,925
- Well, aren't you a wonder?
- It's safe.

873
01:11:33,097 --> 01:11:35,588
He won't find it.
He doesn't smoke my kind.

874
01:11:35,933 --> 01:11:38,231
- Quit worrying, I'll get it.
- No, you won't!

875
01:11:38,403 --> 01:11:41,531
You'll stay right where you are
till this thing blows over.

876
01:11:41,706 --> 01:11:44,004
Now, promise me that
you won't go near the place.

877
01:11:44,175 --> 01:11:47,372
That's easy.
I wouldn't exactly enjoy looking...

878
01:11:47,545 --> 01:11:50,173
Looking at his bandaged feet.

879
01:11:50,481 --> 01:11:51,948
Well, that's too bad.

880
01:11:52,116 --> 01:11:54,778
But what about us?
What about the poor devils he captured?

881
01:11:54,952 --> 01:11:58,683
You know, I wouldn't put it past him
to use a Chinese boot on them.

882
01:11:58,856 --> 01:12:01,290
- Lf he does, they'll talk.
- He won't use the boot.

883
01:12:01,459 --> 01:12:04,292
- He'd never hit a man below the belt.
- We're not hung yet.

884
01:12:04,462 --> 01:12:07,295
Gaskell may suspect the whole world,
but he's got to prove it.

885
01:12:07,465 --> 01:12:10,662
- Let him prove it. Let him prove...
- Are you out of your mind?

886
01:12:13,805 --> 01:12:15,705
All right, come in.

887
01:12:16,841 --> 01:12:19,674
Captain Gaskell's compliments.
Will you come to his cabin?

888
01:12:19,844 --> 01:12:22,005
And you, too, Miss Portland.

889
01:12:23,314 --> 01:12:25,077
Just a minute.

890
01:12:29,287 --> 01:12:33,280
- Jamesy, that...
- Wait a minute. It's a matter of routine.

891
01:12:33,458 --> 01:12:36,859
If it comes to the worst, I'm the
only one he can prove anything against.

892
01:12:37,028 --> 01:12:40,429
So you just sit tight
and keep a stiff upper lip.

893
01:12:40,598 --> 01:12:42,031
All right, bozo.

894
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:46,193
Order me an upper and lower,
and I'll keep them both stiff.

895
01:12:46,537 --> 01:12:49,233
All right, after you left
my cabin, where did you go?

896
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:51,068
- Back to my own quarters.
- What time?

897
01:12:51,242 --> 01:12:52,971
- Half past 11.
- Was anybody there?

898
01:12:53,144 --> 01:12:55,078
Isabelle. I told her to go to bed.

899
01:12:55,279 --> 01:12:57,611
She said she was asleep
at a quarter after 9.

900
01:12:57,782 --> 01:13:00,979
It's always a quarter after 9 to her.
It's the only time she knows.

901
01:13:01,152 --> 01:13:03,712
- Anybody come to your cabin later?
- My dates are my own.

902
01:13:03,888 --> 01:13:06,413
The deck watch saw a man
leaving your cabin after 1:00.

903
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:08,718
- That was you?
- Look here, Alan, that's not...

904
01:13:08,893 --> 01:13:10,656
I'm conducting this inquiry, Sir Guy.

905
01:13:10,828 --> 01:13:14,264
- That was you, wasn't it?
- You want me to blacken the lady's name?

906
01:13:14,432 --> 01:13:16,263
- That was Jamesy?
- Supposing it was?

907
01:13:16,801 --> 01:13:17,859
Why was he there?

908
01:13:18,035 --> 01:13:21,061
He came to borrow a
hot-water bottle for one of his pigs.

909
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:24,071
- Got a cigarette, Jamesy?
- No, darling.

910
01:13:24,242 --> 01:13:26,870
- Here, you better have one of your own.
- No, never mind...

911
01:13:27,044 --> 01:13:29,808
No bother at all. I know
what these little attentions mean.

912
01:13:29,981 --> 01:13:33,144
I don't want one now.
I guess it's just nerves.

913
01:13:33,851 --> 01:13:38,015
I'm sorry you don't feel well.
You rode out the piracy in such good shape.

914
01:13:38,990 --> 01:13:42,949
- Perhaps you'd like one.
- Well, thank you.

915
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:47,496
The captain is far more generous
with your cigarettes than you ever were.

916
01:13:47,665 --> 01:13:52,466
Too generous. I guess I'll take them home
while there's still a couple left for myself.

917
01:13:54,205 --> 01:13:57,140
- How many tins have you, Jamesy?
- One.

918
01:13:57,308 --> 01:13:59,674
- Four and one are five. L...
- Lose any?

919
01:13:59,844 --> 01:14:02,574
I thought I left six here.

920
01:14:02,747 --> 01:14:05,113
Oh, yes. Yes, so you did. I almost forgot.

921
01:14:05,283 --> 01:14:07,410
I don't understand this
cat-and-mouse business.

922
01:14:07,585 --> 01:14:09,416
Is this the one?

923
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:11,381
Yes, that's it.

924
01:14:16,761 --> 01:14:20,390
You won't find what you're looking for.
I have both halves of the £100 note.

925
01:14:20,565 --> 01:14:22,533
What are you browbeating the girl for?

926
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:25,464
Just a minute, MacArdle. Your turn's next.

927
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:30,129
One half of the note was found on
a dead pirate. The other half was hidden...

928
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:33,143
...in her cigarette tin.

929
01:14:34,512 --> 01:14:35,911
Hello.

930
01:14:36,147 --> 01:14:40,641
- These Chinese characters look familiar.
- Yes, they're MacArdle's shipping symbol.

931
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:45,451
Well, that's queer.
If I wasn't sure of it...

932
01:14:45,623 --> 01:14:49,115
...l'd swear that I wrote those characters.
- I'll swear you wrote them...

933
01:14:49,293 --> 01:14:52,126
...before any admiralty court.
- What'll your oath prove?

934
01:14:52,296 --> 01:14:54,355
Save your breath. Your men talked.

935
01:14:54,532 --> 01:14:58,468
- You used the Chinese boot on them.
- No, I saved that for you if I needed it.

936
01:14:59,837 --> 01:15:04,035
How did you get the ship's rifles? You
couldn't have done a thing without them.

937
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:07,177
You've answered all the
questions so far. Don't stop now.

938
01:15:07,678 --> 01:15:10,408
All right, I won't. You gave him
the key to the arsenal.

939
01:15:10,581 --> 01:15:13,141
- She gave me nothing.
- Only you knew where it was.

940
01:15:13,317 --> 01:15:15,217
- You came to my cabin.
- Lots of times.

941
01:15:15,386 --> 01:15:19,322
- Lifted the key, handed it over to MacArdle.
- That's a lie. I'll sue the line.

942
01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:22,288
- Defaming a lady's character.
- Yes. Quartermaster.

943
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:24,360
- Yes, sir.
- Get the sergeant of the guard.

944
01:15:24,528 --> 01:15:27,463
Send a radio message
to the police superintendent at Singapore.

945
01:15:27,632 --> 01:15:29,930
- Tell him to meet us at the dock. Urgent.
- Urgent.

946
01:15:30,134 --> 01:15:33,831
You better send for a squad of lawyers too,
if you're gonna pin anything on me.

947
01:15:34,005 --> 01:15:36,098
- What a snake you are.
- What's that to you?

948
01:15:36,274 --> 01:15:39,539
Getting into my cabin, waiting for a chance
to do your double-crossing.

949
01:15:39,710 --> 01:15:42,645
Turning on your own people!
Sold out every man, woman and child!

950
01:15:42,813 --> 01:15:44,405
All right, then I did.

951
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:47,142
I stole the key.
Yes, I stole it and gave it to Jamesy.

952
01:15:47,318 --> 01:15:49,513
But I came to your cabin
to warn you about him.

953
01:15:49,687 --> 01:15:51,655
Figure it out for yourself why I didn't.

954
01:15:51,822 --> 01:15:54,552
I'd have stood and
fought back-to-back with you.

955
01:15:54,725 --> 01:15:57,660
But you taught me something
I didn't even know myself.

956
01:15:57,828 --> 01:16:00,797
When a woman can love a man
right down to her fingertips...

957
01:16:00,965 --> 01:16:03,763
...she can hate him the same way.
Now, call your cops.

958
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:09,201
Call every cop in the country. I don't care!
If you can dish it out, I can take it!

959
01:16:12,410 --> 01:16:14,173
You fool.

960
01:16:14,345 --> 01:16:17,405
You hotheaded, crazy little fool.

961
01:16:21,419 --> 01:16:26,254
And me thinking all the time
that my powers of fascination had won her.

962
01:16:27,358 --> 01:16:30,350
Don't be so tough, Gaskell.

963
01:16:30,895 --> 01:16:33,762
China Doll there had
nothing to do with it at all.

964
01:16:34,598 --> 01:16:37,032
You think it's as simple as all that?

965
01:16:37,201 --> 01:16:39,931
I'm not the judge, the jury and the law.

966
01:16:40,104 --> 01:16:43,232
- You'll find that out soon enough.
- No, I won't.

967
01:16:43,407 --> 01:16:47,070
I've fooled them many a time before,
and I've done it again.

968
01:16:47,244 --> 01:16:50,372
I've cost you millions,
and I'd still be fooling them...

969
01:16:50,548 --> 01:16:52,982
...if it wasn't
for the little yellow-haired lass...

970
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:56,347
...that wouldn't even give me
the time of the day.

971
01:17:00,891 --> 01:17:04,019
- What's wrong, MacArdle?
- Nothing.

972
01:17:05,396 --> 01:17:07,330
Nothing at all.

973
01:17:10,901 --> 01:17:15,702
One of those pills will make a pig sleep
the entire voyage.

974
01:17:16,474 --> 01:17:20,410
- I'll sleep until kingdom come.
- Get a doctor, quick.

975
01:17:20,878 --> 01:17:22,436
Jamesy.

976
01:17:24,915 --> 01:17:29,511
I had a chance, darling,
to throw you overboard.

977
01:17:29,687 --> 01:17:32,622
If I had, I'd still be safe.

978
01:17:33,724 --> 01:17:38,923
Loving you is the only decent thing
I ever did in my life.

979
01:17:39,997 --> 01:17:42,625
Even that was a mistake.

980
01:17:50,674 --> 01:17:53,234
- You sent for me, sir?
- Take Miss Portland to her cabin.

981
01:17:53,411 --> 01:17:56,972
- Keep a close watch until further orders.
- Aye, sir.

982
01:17:58,115 --> 01:18:01,642
Well, he's out of it anyway.
He finished the game the way he played it.

983
01:18:01,819 --> 01:18:03,411
Yeah, tough.

984
01:18:03,587 --> 01:18:08,388
He didn't yell ''no dice'' when
they rolled against him. I won't either.

985
01:18:08,559 --> 01:18:10,322
Good luck, toots.

986
01:18:25,376 --> 01:18:27,071
Singapore.

987
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:30,441
So am I. Where are you from?

988
01:18:41,459 --> 01:18:44,485
Lordy, lordy. Now I got enough
clothes to last me a million years.

989
01:18:44,662 --> 01:18:46,653
I hope you have better luck in them than I.

990
01:18:46,831 --> 01:18:49,322
Don't you worry, Miss Dolly,
I got me a conjure.

991
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:52,333
The left hind leg of a cat
that's been killed by a snakebite.

992
01:18:52,503 --> 01:18:56,439
Nothing gonna touch me,
no matter what they does to you.

993
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:02,442
Yes?

994
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:04,513
Darling,
have you put your house in order?

995
01:19:04,715 --> 01:19:06,478
No, it's in a worse mess than ever.

996
01:19:06,650 --> 01:19:10,142
Sybil, I should have told you.
I'll be tied up for weeks at the hearing.

997
01:19:10,321 --> 01:19:13,552
Now, Alan, dear,
what are you trying to tell me? Be frank.

998
01:19:13,724 --> 01:19:18,684
That's just it. I want you to escape the
frankness thrown around the next weeks.

999
01:19:18,863 --> 01:19:22,993
Everybody will know about it, read about it,
even at home, the people you know.

1000
01:19:23,167 --> 01:19:25,635
But you can live down a scandal
if you want to.

1001
01:19:25,803 --> 01:19:29,000
Yes, but this will have
an official stamp on it.

1002
01:19:29,173 --> 01:19:31,698
I'll have to get up in court,
tell the whole story.

1003
01:19:31,876 --> 01:19:37,542
I want to, Sybil, because I'm involved.
In fact, I'm as guilty as she.

1004
01:19:37,715 --> 01:19:40,513
Guilty? What nonsense.
How could you be, Alan?

1005
01:19:40,684 --> 01:19:42,515
I am, though.

1006
01:19:42,786 --> 01:19:45,687
She tried to warn me about MacArdle,
I wouldn't listen.

1007
01:19:45,856 --> 01:19:47,687
I nearly threw her out...

1008
01:19:49,793 --> 01:19:53,388
...with as dirty an insult
as a man could give a woman.

1009
01:19:53,564 --> 01:19:57,000
- That's not like you.
- I don't know why.

1010
01:19:57,234 --> 01:20:01,728
Except, I'd just seen her
in MacArdle's cabin.

1011
01:20:02,172 --> 01:20:04,800
I didn't think she could skid that far.

1012
01:20:09,813 --> 01:20:12,213
Then you're really in love with...

1013
01:20:13,984 --> 01:20:15,815
...this old tub, after all.

1014
01:20:16,453 --> 01:20:18,944
No. No, but it's that too.

1015
01:20:19,490 --> 01:20:24,257
After all, you can't pile up six years of
something, and then just leave it in a flash.

1016
01:20:24,428 --> 01:20:25,656
No.

1017
01:20:26,363 --> 01:20:28,194
No, of course not.

1018
01:20:31,735 --> 01:20:35,501
Well, I'm off to the hotel.
I'll take the next boat home.

1019
01:20:36,907 --> 01:20:39,740
You know, I came 15,000 miles
to find you, Alan.

1020
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:42,071
Now you're further away
than you ever were.

1021
01:20:42,246 --> 01:20:44,578
You wouldn't like
that fireplace in Sussex.

1022
01:20:44,949 --> 01:20:47,918
I think that's what
I've been trying to tell you.

1023
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:53,015
Sybil, aren't you clinging to something
that I could never be again?

1024
01:20:53,524 --> 01:20:55,458
Yes, perhaps I am.

1025
01:20:55,626 --> 01:20:58,823
And I think that's the only beautiful way
it ever could be.

1026
01:21:00,064 --> 01:21:01,793
Goodbye, Alan.

1027
01:21:01,966 --> 01:21:03,831
Goodbye, Sybil.

1028
01:21:10,407 --> 01:21:14,673
Come on, you old large, limping sea gull.
Come to the office and resign.

1029
01:21:14,845 --> 01:21:16,836
Don't worry, I'll resign soon enough.

1030
01:21:17,014 --> 01:21:19,244
All I've gotta do is
scratch my name on paper.

1031
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:24,080
Around this madhouse, there's a million
things to do before you do what you want.

1032
01:21:27,758 --> 01:21:29,885
I'll make it up to you. Honest, I will.

1033
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:31,857
Hey, you're just the guy.

1034
01:21:32,029 --> 01:21:34,793
Where can I pick up a string of
real pearls for the missis?

1035
01:21:34,965 --> 01:21:37,092
Yes, I'll be very glad
to arrange it for you.

1036
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:39,861
That's a pal. I told you I'd
square it with you, poopsie.

1037
01:21:40,037 --> 01:21:42,437
You've squared it beautifully.

1038
01:21:43,574 --> 01:21:46,737
- Bank sent for the gold, sir.
- All right, turn it over to them.

1039
01:21:46,910 --> 01:21:50,141
But there isn't any gold, sir.
The boxes were full of sand.

1040
01:21:50,314 --> 01:21:51,645
Oh, yes, yes. So they were.

1041
01:21:51,815 --> 01:21:54,579
The shipment's in the toolbox
of the steamroller.

1042
01:21:55,285 --> 01:21:57,879
Steamroller? Tool box?

1043
01:21:59,923 --> 01:22:03,415
That stumps me, sir. I never would
have thought of looking for it there.

1044
01:22:03,594 --> 01:22:06,324
No. I was counting on that.

1045
01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:15,561
So you decided
to make the trip after all.

1046
01:22:15,739 --> 01:22:18,833
Yes. Yes, I just came along
looking for local color.

1047
01:22:19,009 --> 01:22:23,036
Local color, phooey. If anybody
could get local color, I can get it.

1048
01:22:23,213 --> 01:22:27,047
Old Ringside Kid with an
eye like a hawk. Old hawk-eye.

1049
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:33,119
These streets are in deplorable condition.

1050
01:22:35,059 --> 01:22:38,825
Quartermaster, fish him out before he
soaks up all the local color in the harbor.

1051
01:22:38,996 --> 01:22:40,122
Aye, aye, sir.

1052
01:22:43,367 --> 01:22:44,925
Come in.

1053
01:22:47,404 --> 01:22:51,272
- Is the police superintendent ready?
- He'll be here any minute now. Come on.

1054
01:22:51,442 --> 01:22:53,410
- Goodbye, Isabelle.
- Goodbye, Miss Dolly.

1055
01:22:53,577 --> 01:22:57,809
You sure been mighty good to me,
even if they does hang you.

1056
01:23:02,119 --> 01:23:03,882
Well, there's the old Kin How.

1057
01:23:04,054 --> 01:23:06,579
Aren't they ever gonna paint
that smokestack?

1058
01:23:06,757 --> 01:23:10,955
Boy, how you used to crab about it
when you were first mate on her.

1059
01:23:11,228 --> 01:23:14,129
Seems like a thousand years ago.

1060
01:23:14,498 --> 01:23:20,027
You don't need to talk if you don't want.
I was doing it for those mugs back there.

1061
01:23:20,404 --> 01:23:22,167
That's what I thought.

1062
01:23:22,339 --> 01:23:24,432
Never seen you overlook an audience.

1063
01:23:24,608 --> 01:23:27,577
That's more like it. It's good
to have you barking at me again.

1064
01:23:27,745 --> 01:23:32,409
Always worrying about your performance.
You care about nothing except the act.

1065
01:23:33,283 --> 01:23:36,150
- What are you crying for?
- I can't help it.

1066
01:23:37,321 --> 01:23:39,755
Get in there,
and quit that blubbering.

1067
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:46,222
- Now, listen to me.
- I'm all ears.

1068
01:23:46,396 --> 01:23:50,332
My job ends when I turn you over to
the police. From then on, I'm on your side.

1069
01:23:50,501 --> 01:23:53,334
What's the use? I'm gonna
plead guilty and take what's coming.

1070
01:23:53,504 --> 01:23:56,598
- You're going to tell the truth.
- Sure. That's the least I can do.

1071
01:23:56,774 --> 01:24:00,676
I'm going to tell the truth. That you
tried to warn me, that I was drunk.

1072
01:24:00,844 --> 01:24:02,607
- No, you weren't.
- I was dead drunk.

1073
01:24:02,780 --> 01:24:05,578
You big clunk, you'll gum up the works.
You'll ruin yourself.

1074
01:24:05,749 --> 01:24:07,979
You'll bust up your
whole career if you do that.

1075
01:24:08,152 --> 01:24:13,784
- There's nothing else. It's your only chance.
- Never mind me. What about her?

1076
01:24:14,291 --> 01:24:17,192
- She's going back to England.
- Back to England?

1077
01:24:17,361 --> 01:24:19,693
- But you love her.
- She's leaving on the next boat.

1078
01:24:19,863 --> 01:24:22,093
You can't let her.
You're still in love with her.

1079
01:24:22,266 --> 01:24:24,928
- Don't tell me what to do.
- You're still in love with her.

1080
01:24:25,102 --> 01:24:27,696
- Don't yell, I'm not deaf.
- You poor sap, you love her.

1081
01:24:27,871 --> 01:24:29,532
- Don't call me a sap.
- You love her!

1082
01:24:29,706 --> 01:24:31,640
Yes, I love her!

1083
01:24:33,343 --> 01:24:35,402
But not the way I do you.

1084
01:24:35,813 --> 01:24:39,749
Toots, you can't. That ain't fair.
It ain't right. A no-good dame like me.

1085
01:24:39,917 --> 01:24:43,580
- I'll always have you in trouble...
- No, you won't.

1086
01:24:44,521 --> 01:24:46,853
Married life will slow you down plenty.

1087
01:24:48,559 --> 01:24:49,958
You...

1088
01:24:51,295 --> 01:24:53,525
You'd marry me?

1089
01:24:53,697 --> 01:24:56,996
Well, no, not if you're gonna
make it such a blasted favor.

1090
01:24:57,734 --> 01:25:00,362
You poor sap.

1091
01:25:01,538 --> 01:25:02,835
Come in.

1092
01:25:03,006 --> 01:25:04,234
Good morning, captain.

1093
01:25:04,408 --> 01:25:07,002
- Good morning.
- Here's your receipt for the prisoners.

1094
01:25:07,177 --> 01:25:08,838
Yes, all right.

1095
01:25:10,581 --> 01:25:12,742
I'll be over as soon as I get through.

1096
01:25:12,916 --> 01:25:14,679
- Anything you want...
- Anything l...

1097
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:19,719
Toots, I got everything.

1098
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:24,858
Come on, superintendent,
let's get on the horse.

1099
01:25:26,663 --> 01:25:30,656
- What about a nip to cool that aching brow?
- No, no. Fix one for yourself.

1100
01:25:30,834 --> 01:25:34,634
I gotta get around to court.
Somebody'll have to protect that judge.

1101
01:25:39,243 --> 01:25:41,609
Those shoes are
disgraceful on a ship's officer.

1102
01:25:41,778 --> 01:25:44,372
- A hose coupling broke...
- Hose couplings shouldn't break.

1103
01:25:44,548 --> 01:25:47,381
Change the hose and
change your shoes, Mr. Kingston.

1104
01:25:49,052 --> 01:25:51,919
''Change your shoes, Mr. Kingston.''

1105
01:25:52,089 --> 01:25:56,822
Piracy, typhoon, a disabled ship swung into
port, his sweetheart on her way to jail...

1106
01:25:56,994 --> 01:25:59,827
...and all he can say
by way of conversation is:

1107
01:25:59,997 --> 01:26:03,489
- ''Change your shoes, Mr. Kingston.''
- That bark of his is all front.

1108
01:26:03,667 --> 01:26:07,967
- He's really pretty sick-at-heart.
- Sick? The man hasn't got a heart.

1109
01:26:08,138 --> 01:26:09,765
Perhaps not, Mr. Kingston.

1110
01:26:09,940 --> 01:26:13,740
But whatever it is he has,
he gets things done.
