2
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,340
你知道他们在争论什么吗?
Do you have any idea what they were arguing about?

3
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,970
你会说英语吗?
Do you speak English?

4
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,070
会
Yeah.

5
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,010
不过抱歉,我的德语不太好
No. I'm sorry,my German is not very good.

6
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,590
你听说过年龄会导致夫妻间失去互相倾听的能力吗?
Have you heard that as couples age they lose their ability to hear each other?

7
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,780
没有
No.

8
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,530
理论上男人会丧失听高音的能力...
Supposedly, men lose their ability to hear high-pitched sounds...

9
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,720
...而女人会丧失低音听力
...and women lose hearing in the low end.

10
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,530
这是一种相互抵制
I guess they nullify each other.

11
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,900
我想是的,自然法则是让夫妻白头偕老...
I guess. Nature's way of allowing couples to grow old together...

12
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,970
...而不是互相残杀
...without killing each other.

13
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,470
你在看什么书?
What are you reading?

14
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,840
哦
Oh, yeah.

15
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,880
你呢?
How about you?

16
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,790
我打算去休息室
I was thinking about going to the lounge car.

17
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,040
-你愿意和我一起去吗?   -好啊
-Would you like to come with me? -Yeah.

18
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,240
好的
Okay.

19
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,750
你的英语怎么说得这么好?
How do you speak such good English?

20
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,620
我在洛杉矶上过一个暑期班
I went to school for a summer in Los Angeles.

21
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,390
-坐这好吗?   -好的
-It's fine here? -Yeah, this is good.

22
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,570
我还在伦敦呆过一段时间
And I spent some time in London.

23
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,540
-哇  -那你的英语怎么说得这样好呢?
-Wow. -How do you speak such good English?

24
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,400
我?我是美国人
Me? I'm American.

25
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,680
-你是美国人?你肯定?  -当然
-You're American? Are you sure? -Yeah.

26
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,910
开个玩笑,我早知道你是美国人
No, I'm joking.I knew you were American.

27
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,740
而且你不会说任何其他语言,是吗?
And you don't speak any other language, right?

28
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,220
是的,是的,我知道你的意思
Yeah, yeah.I get it, I get it.

29
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,620
我是拙劣,弱智,粗俗的美国人...
I'm the crude, dumb,vulgar American...

30
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,560
...不会说其他语言,没有自己的文化,但我尝试过
...who doesn't speak other languages,who has no culture. But I tried.

31
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,390
我在高中学过法语,我第一次去巴黎...
I took French in high school.When I first got to Paris...

32
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,970
...在地铁站排队时
...I stood in line at the metro station.

33
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:09,360
一直练习--(法语)
I was practicing.

34
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,100
不管是什么
Whatever.

35
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,810
轮到我时,我看着那个售票员...
And I get up there,and I look at this woman...

36
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,950
...脑子一片空白,然后我说"我要一张票去..."
...and my mind goes blank. And I say,"I need a ticket to get to...."

37
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,620
话说回来...
So anyway....

38
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,850
你是去哪?
So where are you headed?

39
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,120
回巴黎
Well, back to Paris.

40
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,630
-我下周就要开学了  -你还在上学?什么学校?
-My classes start next week. -You're still in school? Where?

41
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,920
巴黎大学,听说过吗?
La Sorbonne. You know?

42
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,190
当然
Sure.

43
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,730
你从布达佩斯来?
You're coming from Budapest?

44
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,970
-我去看过我的祖母  -她人好吗?
-I was visiting my grandmother. -Oh. How is she?

45
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:33,200
事实上我对此颇感自豪
Well, I mean, I eventually kind of took pride in it.

46
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:35,900
就好象生命是我自己创造的
You know, like my life was my own doing.

47
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:39,240
就象我是盛宴上的不速之客
You know, like I was crashing the big party.

48
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:41,470
可以这样看待
That's the way to see it.

49
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:45,050
我父母仍在一起,我猜他们很幸福
My parents are still married and I guess they're happy.

50
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:50,180
不过我觉得未雨绸缪是正确的做法
But I think it's healthy to rebel against everything that came before.

51
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,890
知道吗,最近我很好奇...
You know, I've been wondering lately...

52
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:01,100
...你认识什么婚姻幸福的人吗?
...do you know anyone who's in a happy relationship?

53
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:05,760
当然,我认识一些幸福的夫妇
Yeah, sure. You know,I know happy couples.

54
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,600
可我认为他们在互相欺骗
But I think they lie to each other.

55
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:10,570
是啊
Yeah.

56
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,640
人们能在谎言中生活一辈子
People can live their whole life as a lie.

57
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,750
我的祖母结了婚...
My grandmother was married...

58
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:19,050
...我以为她有份简单的爱情生活
...and I thought she had an uncomplicated love life.

59
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:23,280
但她向我承认,她穷其一生...
But she just confessed to me that she spent her whole life...

60
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:26,550
...在梦想着她爱的另一个男人
...dreaming about another man she was in love with.

61
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:30,090
她屈从于命运,这太可悲了
She just accepted her fate.It's so sad.

62
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,430
但我也很高兴她有那种情感...
In the same time, I love that she had these emotions...

63
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,970
...而我从没想过她会有
...and feelings I never thought she had.

64
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:38,400
我敢说那样更好
I guarantee you it was better that way.

65
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:41,970
一旦了解了他,她最终会对他感到失望
If she'd known him, he'd have disappointed her eventually.

66
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,540
-你怎么知道?   -我当然知道
-How do you know? -I know. I know.

67
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,310
人们将浪漫想象得高于一切
People put romantic projections on everything.

68
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,210
那没有任何事实依据
It's not based in any kind of reality.

69
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:54,120
浪漫想象?哦,摩天轮里的就是浪漫先生啦?
Romantic projections?Oh, Mr. Romantic up in the Ferris wheel?

70
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,620
"哦,吻我吧,日落是多么美丽啊"
"Oh, kiss me. The sunset.Oh, it's so beautiful."

71
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:01,320
说说你祖母吧,你刚才是怎么说的?
Tell me about your grandmother.What were you saying about her?

72
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:20,980
看他们的口型
Check these guys out.

73
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:25,680
"汉斯,我要做忏悔,我没穿内衣"
"Hans, I have a confession. I'm not wearing underwear underneath this."

74
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:28,550
"哦,是吗?这让你害怕了?"
"Oh, really? Does that frighten you? "

75
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,400
可以告诉你个秘密吗?
Can I tell you a secret?

76
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:37,790
当然
Yeah.

77
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,130
过来
Come here.

78
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,940
-什么?  -过来
-What? -Come here.

79
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,980
这个看手相的看起来挺有趣
Look at this palm reader.She's interesting looking.

80
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,210
是的
Yeah.

81
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,120
-噢 -怎么了?
-Uh-oh. Uh-oh. -What?

82
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:04,080
-她注意到了  -她不会过来的
-I made eye contact.  -She's not coming over here.

83
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:06,280
-不,她会 -哦,见鬼
-Yes, she is. -Oh, shit.

84
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,620
哦,不
Oh, no.

85
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,890
-你想看手相吗?-不
-You want your palm read? -No.

86
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,700
挺好的
She's okay.

87
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,070
-身体还好吧?  -还不错
-She's all right? -She's fine.

88
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:54,410
-你呢?你去哪?  -我去维也纳
-How about you? Where are you going? -I'm going to vienna.

89
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,740
维也纳?那里怎么样?
vienna?What's there?

90
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,150
不知道,我明天就会离开
No idea.I'm flying out of there tomorrow.

91
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,910
你在渡假?
You're on holiday?

92
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,490
要知道我也不清楚这算不算渡假
I don't really know what I'm on.You know?

93
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,000
我只是四处旅行,坐了两三个星期的火车
I've just been traveling around,riding trains for two or three weeks.

94
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,100
是去拜访朋友还是纯粹的旅行?
You were visiting friends or just on your own?

95
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,830
我有个朋友在马德里,不过...
I had a friend in Madrid, but....

96
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,570
-马德里,那儿很漂亮  -我有张全欧火车优惠票...
-Madrid, that's nice. -I got a Eurail pass...

97
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,870
...就是这样
...is what I did.

98
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,200
不错的理由
hat's great.

99
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,980
那这次环欧旅行对你有帮助吗?
So has this trip around Europe been good for you?

100
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,090
是的,当然,它...它很有快感
Yeah, sure. It's been....It sucked.

101
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,980
什么?
What?

102
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,080
它有它的...
It's had its....

103
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,930
这么说吧,坐上几个礼拜来看窗外的景色...
I'll tell you, sitting for weeks on end looking out the window...

104
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,390
...感觉的确很不错
...has actually been kind of great.

105
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,420
你是指什么?
What do you mean?

106
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,370
你知道的,比如说...
Well, you know, for instance...

107
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:51,010
...会想到一些平时想不到的想法
...you have ideas that you ordinarily wouldn't have.

108
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,230
-什么想法?   -想听一个吗?
-What kind of ideas? -Want to hear one?

109
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,430
-说说看   -好的
-Tell me. -All right.

110
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,580
我有这个想法是因为一个电视节目
I have this idea, okay,for a television show.

111
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,480
我有个朋友是"享受电视"栏目的制作人
Some friends of mine are cable-access producers.

112
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,280
知道它的运作方式吗?
Do you know what that is?

113
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,520
他们播放任何人制作的低成本节目
Anybody can produce a show real cheap,and they have to put it on.

114
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:12,890
我的想法是让一个节目24小时播放并持续一年
I have this idea for a show that lasts 24 hours a day for a year straight.

115
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,320
你要做的就是找到...
What you do is you get...

116
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:18,870
...来自世界各地不同城市的365个人...
...365 people from cities all over the world...

117
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,060
...为每个人拍一部24小时的生活纪录片
...to do these 24-hour documents of real time.

118
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,870
捕捉真实的生活画面
Capturing life as it's lived.

119
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,030
知道吗,可以从一个人早上起床开始...
You know, it would start with a guy waking up in the morning...

120
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,270
...舒舒服服洗个澡...
...and taking the long shower...

121
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,210
...吃点早餐,喝点咖啡...
...eating a little breakfast,making a little coffee...

122
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,550
...看看报纸...
...reading the paper....

123
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:42,050
等一下,全都是大家见鬼的生活中每天那些平淡无聊的琐事吗?
Wait. All those mundane,boring things everybody has to do every day of their fucking life?

124
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,350
是"诗意的日复一日的生活"
I was going to say,"The poetry of day-to-day life."

125
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,050
你有你的说法,我有我的说法
You say it your way.I'll say it my way.

126
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,260
-你肯定?  -我肯定
-Are you sure? -I'm sure.

127
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,960
-好吧  -你好
-Okay. -Hello.

128
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,870
她来了
Oh, here she is.

129
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,050
我想要你看个手相
I want your palm read.

130
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,350
行,多少钱?
Yeah. How much is it?

131
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,280
算你50
For you, 50.

132
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,650
行吗?
Okay?

133
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:39,990
行
Okay.

134
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,570
你正在旅行...
So you have been on a journey...

135
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,740
...你不是本地人
...and you're a stranger to this place.

136
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,410
你是个...
You are...

137
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,170
...冒险家
...an adventurer.

138
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,200
一个探索者
A seeker.

139
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,240
你内心中有个冒险家
An adventurer in your mind.

140
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:09,490
你对女性的力量很感兴趣
You are interested in the power of the woman.

141
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:14,590
还有女性潜在的力量和创造力
In the woman's deep strength and creativity.

142
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,330
你正在成为这种女人
You're becoming this woman.

143
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:26,970
你需要摆脱自己拙劣的生活
You need to resign yourself to the awkwardness of life.

144
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,040
只有找到内心深处的宁静...
Only if you find peace within yourself...

145
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:35,270
...才能找到和别人的真正关联
...will you find true connection with others.

146
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,250
你和他并不熟是吗?
That is a stranger to you?

147
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,420
我想是的
I guess so.

148
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,860
你不会有事,他正在学习
You will be all right.He's learning.

149
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,660
好了
Okay.

150
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:54,200
给钱
Money.

151
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,940
你们都是星宿
You're both stars.

152
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,700
别忘了
Don't forget.

153
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:09,240
当星星在亿万年前爆炸时...
When the stars exploded billions of years ago...

154
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:12,250
...它们形成了世上的一切
...they formed everything that is this world.

155
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:15,320
我们认识的一切都是星尘
Everything we know is stardust.

156
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,460
所以别忘了,你们也是
So don't forget, you are stardust.

157
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,930
这很不错
That's very nice and all.

158
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,470
我是指我们都是星尘
I mean, that we're all stardust...

159
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:31,100
...而你会成为一个伟大的女性
...and you're becoming this great woman.

160
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:34,200
不过我希望你不要太当真...
But I hope you don't take that any more seriously...

161
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:36,540
...和报纸上的占卜相比
...than some horoscope in a newspaper.

162
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:41,010
为什么?她知道我在渡假,还知道我们互不相识
What? She knew I was on vacation and that we didn't know each other...

163
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:44,120
...还有我会成为一个伟大的女人
...and that I was going to become this great woman.

164
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,690
那"我在学习"是什么鬼话?
But what was that "l am learning" bullshit?

165
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:49,220
那是些套话,明白吗?
That's way condescending, you know?

166
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,480
当时她并没看我的手
I mean, she wasn't even doing me.

167
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:56,030
如果投机取巧者真是那样必须说真话的话
I mean, if opportunists like that ever had to tell the real truth...

168
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,290
...他们就会失业
...it would put them out of business.

169
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:03,100
我乐意看到一个瘦小老妇把她的所有积蓄...
Just once, I'd love to see some little old lady save up all her money...

170
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:07,970
...拿去算命,到那后算命的女人说...
...to go to the fortuneteller. She'd get there and the woman would say...

171
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,260
-可以这样想--  -有谁会看呢?
-Think of it like this-- -Who's gonna watch?

172
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,600
可以这样想,一只狗在太阳底下睡觉...
Think about it like this. Why is it that a dog sleeping in the sun...

173
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:56,460
...画面很美是不是?是的,确实很美
...is so beautiful?It is. It's beautiful.

174
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,270
但一个人从提款机取钱...
But a guy taking money from a bank machine...

175
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,500
...为什么就显得无聊了呢?
...looks like a complete moron?

176
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,910
这就象国家地理杂志的节目,只不过拍的是人
So it's like a National GEographic program, but on people.

177
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,950
正是
Yeah.

178
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:08,980
觉得怎么样?
What do you think?

179
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,050
是的,我明白,就象,"无聊24小时"--对不起--
Yeah, I can see it.Like, 24 boring hours-- Sorry--

180
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,710
...在一段3分钟的性交场面之后主角就睡着了
...and a three-minute sex scene where he falls asleep right after.

181
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,960
对啊,那会是一段很不错的情节
Yeah, and that would be a great episode.

182
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,560
人们会谈论这段情节
People would talk about that episode.

183
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,640
如果愿意的话你可以和朋友在巴黎拍上一集
You and your friends could do one in Paris if you wanted.

184
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,640
我不知道,关键是地理分布问题让我头疼
I don't know. The key, the thing that haunts me is the distribution.

185
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,780
要一个城镇接一个城镇地拍摄以保证它的持续性
Getting these tapes from town to town so it would play continuously.

186
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,640
因为它必须不停地播放,否则就没有意义了
Because it would have to play all the time, or it just wouldn't work.

187
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:43,820
谢谢
Thank you.

188
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,450
谢谢
Thanks.

189
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,130
知道吗?没有"服务指南"
You know what?Not service oriented.

190
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,100
只是一份"欧洲观察"
Just an observation about Europe.

191
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:10,070
我父母从没真正谈论过我会恋爱结婚生孩子的可能性
My parents never really spoke of the possibility of my falling in love or getting married or having children.

192
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,410
甚至我还是小女孩时...
Even as a little girl...

193
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,070
...他们就要我考虑未来的职业,例如...
...they wanted me to think as a future career as a, you know...

194
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,480
...室内设计,律师或诸如此类
...interior designer or lawyer or something like that.

195
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,490
我对我爸爸说我想以写作为业
I'd say to my dad, "I want to be a writer."

196
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,420
他就说做记者
And he'd say, "Journalist."

197
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:29,160
我说想开个流浪猫收容所,他就说做兽医
I'd say I wanted to have a refuge for stray cats. He'd say, "veterinarian."

198
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:33,000
我说想做演艺工作,他就说做电视播音员
I'd say I wanted to be an actress.He'd say, "TV newscaster."

199
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,200
这使得我的理想抱负慢慢转变成了...
It was this constant conversion of my fanciful ambition into these...

200
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,740
...现实的赚钱手段
...practical moneymaking ventures.

201
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,570
我很小时就善于洞察谎言
I had a good bullshit detector when I was a kid.

202
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,270
当别人说谎时我总是能知道
I always knew when they were lying to me.

203
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,510
到了高中,我决定...
By high school, I was dead set...

204
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,920
...听听大家认为我这辈子该做什么...
...on listening to what everybody thought I should do with my life...

205
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,920
...然后反其道而行之
...and doing the opposite.

206
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:05,060
没有谁会当真,我只是不喜欢别人将想法强加在我头上
Nobody was ever mean about it.I just could never get very excited about other people's ambitions for my life.

207
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:13,110
"明天和你的下半辈子...
..."Tomorrow and all your remaining days...

208
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,340
"...会和今天全然相同...
...will be exactly like today...

209
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:18,080
"...在无聊中度日
...a tedious collection of hours.

210
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:21,520
"你不会有新激情和新想法
And you will have no new passions and no new thoughts...

211
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,120
"...没有新历程
...and no new travels.

212
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:27,230
"一旦死去就会被完全遗忘
And when you die,you'll be completely forgotten.

213
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,660
"请给50先令"
Fifty schillings, please."

214
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,590
这是我乐意看到的
That I'd like to see.

215
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,100
这太有意思了...
It's so funny how...

216
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,830
...她竟然没怎么注意你,不知是为什么
...she almost didn't notice you.It's weird. I wonder why.

217
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:42,200
她睿智而且热情,我很喜欢听她说的话
She was really wise and intense.I really loved what she said.

218
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:46,240
你是花钱来听让自己感觉良好的话
You pay your money to hear what makes you feel good about yourself.

219
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:49,940
维也纳也许有什么穷街陋巷能买到毒品
Maybe there's a seedy section of vienna.We can buy a hit of crack.

220
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,680
那不是更好?
Would you like that?

221
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:54,010
你也太...
You're so....

222
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,320
星尘,星尘
Stardust. Stardust.

223
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:08,530
有个展览
There's an exhibition.

224
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:13,610
我们赶不上了,要下周才开始
I guess we'll miss it.It doesn't start until next week.

225
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:16,010
看来是这样
Yeah, I think so.

226
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:21,050
其实我在博物馆见过这个
I actually saw this one in a museum.

227
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:24,280
我一直盯着它看
I stared and stared at it.

228
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,780
足足有45分钟
Must have been 45 minutes.

229
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,610
我喜欢它
I love it.

230
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:31,930
La Voie Ferree,真漂亮
La voie ferree.It's great.

231
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:37,290
我喜欢这种人物溶入背景的方式
I love the way the people are dissolving into the background.

232
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,630
看这个
Look at this.

233
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,890
似乎环境...
It's like the environments...

234
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,500
...比人物还要强烈
...are stronger than the people.

235
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:50,110
他的人物轮廓总是很简略
His human figures are always so transitory.

236
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:52,370
有意思吧,简略?
It's funny. Transitory?

237
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,350
简略
Transitory.

238
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,430
-你觉得开门没有?  -不知道,试试看
-You think this is open? -I don't know. Let's try it.

239
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,600
我到过一家这样的教堂...
I was in an old church like this...

240
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,930
...几天前在布达佩斯和我祖母一起
...with my grandmother a few days ago in Budapest.

241
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,870
尽管我排斥大部分宗教的东西...
Even though I reject most of the religious thing...

242
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:57,170
...可还是不自觉地感受到来这的人...
...I can't help but feeling for those people that come here...

243
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:00,640
...迷失,痛苦,内疚...
...lost or in pain, guilt...

244
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,720
...在寻求某种答案
...looking for some kind of answers.

245
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:11,420
能同时容纳那么多代人的痛苦和快乐的地方令我着迷
It fascinates me how a single place can join pain and happiness of so many generations.

246
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:11,420
...


247
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:14,120
你和祖母很亲近?
You're close with your grandmother?

248
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:16,960
是的
Yeah.

249
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:23,060
大概是因为我经常有种奇特的感觉...
I think it's because I always have this strange feeling...

250
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,300
但你知道吗?如果父母从不...
But you know what?If your parents never...

251
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:12,470
...在任何事上完全否定你,而是友好地给予支持...
...fully contradict you about anything and are nice and supportive...

252
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,360
Right.
对

253
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,670
...那会让你很难抱怨
...it makes it even harder to officially complain.

254
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,750
哪怕他们做得并不对,这是一种被动攻击
Even when they're wrong,it's this passive-aggressive shit.

255
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,350
你明白吗?
You know what I mean?

256
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,810
我讨厌这样
I hate it.

257
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,810
非常反感
I really hate it.

258
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,820
知道吗,尽管这种种不快...
Well, you know, despite all that kind of bullshit...

259
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,690
...总是会随之而来
...that comes along with it...

260
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,060
...但我记得童年就象...
...I remember childhood as...

261
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,960
...一段魔幻时光
...this magical time.

262
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:43,110
真的,记得我妈妈第一次跟我说到死亡
I do. I remember when my mother first told me about death.

263
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:48,070
我的曾祖母去世,我们全家去弗罗里达奔丧
My great-grandmother had died, and my family had visited them in Florida.

264
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,340
当时我才3岁或3岁半
I was about 3, 3 1/2 years old.

265
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,980
我在后院玩耍时...
Anyway, I was in the back yard playing...

266
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,780
...姐姐教我怎样拿浇花的水管...
...and my sister had just taught me how to take the garden hose...

267
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,150
...就是象这样子捏着...
...and do it in such a way that...

268
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,120
...喷出的水雾会在阳光下形成一道彩虹
...it sprayed into the sun and would make a rainbow.

269
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,490
于是我那样做...
And so I was doing that...

270
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,860
...透过水雾,我看到了曾祖母
...and through the mist,I could see my grandmother.

271
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:14,370
她就站在那,冲着我微笑
And she was just standing there,smiling at me.

272
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,730
我愣在那很长时间
And I held it there for a long time...

273
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,740
...并且看着她
...and I looked at her.

274
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,210
最终我松开了喷嘴
And then finally, I let go of the nozzle, you know?

275
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,380
然后扔下水管...
And then I dropped the hose...

276
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,310
...她就消失了
...and she disappeared.

277
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,880
于是我跑回屋里告诉父母
And so I run back inside and tell my parents.

278
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,590
他们让我坐下,然后训斥了我一顿...
And they sit me down and give me this big rap on how...

279
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:40,890
...人死了之后你绝不可能再见到他们,那只是我的幻觉
...when people die, you never see them again, and how I'd imagined it.

280
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,620
但我知道我看到了什么,并且为之高兴
But I knew what I'd seen.I was glad I saw that.

281
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:47,790
我以后绝不会再看到类似的情景,但我不知道
I've never seen anything like that since. But I don't know.

282
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,070
那让我有点明白世事都是那么无法解释
It just kind of let me know how ambiguous everything was.

283
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,710
包括死亡
Even death.

284
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,380
你该庆幸你能这样看待死亡
You're lucky you can have this attitude toward death.

285
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,250
我想我时刻都在害怕死亡
I think I'm afraid of death 24 hours a day.

286
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,890
真的,所以我才会坐火车
I swear. I mean, that's why I'm in a train right now.

287
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,750
我可以乘飞机去巴黎,但我害怕
I could've flown to Paris,but I'm scared.

288
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,260
-不会吧   -我控制不了
-Oh, come on. -I can't help it.

289
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:27,260
...我是那个躺着垂死的衰老妇人
...that I'm this very old woman laying down, about to die.

290
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,070
知道吗,我的生活就是...
You know, that my life is just...

291
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,110
...她的记忆或是什么
...her memories or something.

292
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:38,480
这太疯狂了
That's so wild.

293
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:44,120
我时常觉得自己仍然是13岁的小孩...
I always think that I'm still this 13-year-old boy...

294
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:47,420
...不知道怎么做成年人,装模作样...
...who doesn't really know how to be an adult, pretending to...

295
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:52,120
...过自己的生活,逼不得已时做做笔记
...live my life, taking notes for when I'll really have to do it.

296
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,400
仿佛是穿着戏服在演一场初中话剧
Like I'm in a dress rehearsal for a junior high play.

297
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,330
真有趣
That's funny.

298
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,440
那么在摩天轮上时,就象是...
Then up there in the Ferris wheel,it was like...

299
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,710
...垂老妇人吻了一个小男孩,是吗?
...this very old woman kissing this very young boy. Right?

300
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,580
你知道贵格教徒和贵格教的宗旨吗?
Do you know anything about the Quakers, the Quaker religion?

301
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,080
不太清楚
No, not much.

302
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:20,620
我参加过贵格教徒的婚礼...
Well, I went to this Quaker wedding once...

303
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:22,690
...感觉很奇特
...and it was fantastic.

304
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,190
他们的做法是...
What they do is...

305
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,670
...新人走进去跪在所有来宾的面前...
...the couple comes in and they kneel in front of the whole congregation...

306
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,390
...然后彼此凝视
...and they stare at each other.

307
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:37,410
没人说话,除非他们觉得是上帝要他们交谈或发言
Nobody says a word unless they feel that God moves them to speak or say something.

308
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:41,010
然后,经过大约一小时...
And then, after an hour or so of just...

309
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,320
...相互凝视...
...staring at each other...

310
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:46,150
...就成了夫妻
...they're married.

311
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:50,150
太美了,我喜欢这样
That's beautiful. I like that.

312
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,430
有个可怕的故事
This is a horrible story.

313
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:10,500
是什么?
What?

314
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,450
这里不适合讲这事
It's not the appropriate place to tell it.

315
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:16,580
我曾和一个朋友开车兜风
Well, I was driving around with this buddy of mine.

316
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:18,690
他是个坚定的无神论者
He's a big atheist, you know.

317
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:21,750
他在一个流浪汉身旁停下车
And he came to a stop next to this homeless guy.

318
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,250
然后掏出100美元...
My buddy takes out a $ 100 bill...

319
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,860
...探出车窗...
...and leans out the window...

320
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:29,330
...问道,"你相信上帝吗?"
...and he says,"Do you believe in God? "

321
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:33,900
那个人看看我的朋友,看看钱
And the guy looks at my friend,he looks at the money.

322
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:36,070
说道...
He says...

323
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,100
..."是的,我相信"
..."Yes, I do."

324
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:40,240
我朋友说,"回答错误"
My friend says, "Wrong answer."

325
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,930
然后开车走了
We drove away.

326
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:44,270
太可恶了
That's mean.

327
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:59,390
如果你不下火车,现在该到巴黎了吧?
Would you be in Paris by now if you hadn't gotten off the train?

328
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,520
不,还没到
No, not yet.

329
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:03,890
那你会做些什么?
What would you be doing?

330
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,760
也许会在机场逗留...
I'd probably be hanging around the airport...

331
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:10,340
...因为你不在而对着咖啡哭泣
...crying in my coffee because you didn't come with me.

332
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:18,210
也许我会在萨尔茨堡和别人下车
I'd probably gotten off the train in Salzburg with someone else.

333
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:20,380
哦,是吗?我懂了
Oh, yeah? Oh, I see.

334
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:22,480
我只是个愚蠢的美国人...
So I'm just a dumb American...

335
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:26,810
...只能用来当作临时点缀,是吗?
...momentarily decorating your blank canvas, huh?

336
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:30,180
-我玩得很开心  -是吗?
-I'm having a great time. -Really?

337
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:31,620
我也是
Me too.

338
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:35,400
我很高兴没人知道我在这
I'm glad, because no one knows I'm here.

339
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:39,890
不认识能告诉我你做过的所有坏事的人
I don't know anyone that would tell me all those bad things you've done.

340
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,430
-我可以告诉你  -我相信
-I'll tell you some. -Yeah, I'm sure.

341
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,430
听过太多坏事之后我总觉得...
You hear so much shit about people.I always feel like...

342
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,040
...赴约时象个将军
...the general of an army when I start dating.

343
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:52,340
制订好战略战术
Plotting my strategy and maneuverings...

344
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:56,070
...了解他的弱点,什么能伤害他,征服他
...knowing his weak points,what would hurt him, seduce him.

345
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,820
真是恐怖
It's horrible.

346
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,890
如果我们一直呆在一块...
If we were always around each other...

347
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:07,890
...那我第一件能令你发疯的事是什么?
...what would be the first thing about me that would drive you mad?

348
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:11,600
不,我不想回答这个问题
No. I'm not going to answer this question.

349
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,890
有个和我约会过的姑娘经常问我...
I dated this girl once who used to always ask me that.

350
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,700
"我哪方面让你发疯?"
"What about me bugs you? "

351
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:20,600
最后我说,"我觉得你的批评方式不太好"
Finally I said, "l don't think you handle criticism too well."

352
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:23,900
她勃然大怒和我分了手,这是真的
She flew into a rage and broke up with me. That's true.

353
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:26,240
其实她是要找个借口...
All she wanted was to have an excuse...

354
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:29,140
...来告诉我她不该和我交往
...to tell me what she thought was wrong with me.

355
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:30,580
你也想这样吗?
Is that what you want?

356
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:32,510
我哪些方面让你发狂?
Something about me bugs you?

357
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:35,920
-我有什么会令你崩溃?  -根本没有
-What is it about me bugs you? -Nothing at all.

358
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,590
如果非要说的话,会是什么?
If it had to be something,what would it be?

359
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,450
如果非得有,而我非得考虑的话...
If it had to be something,if I had to think about it...

360
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:46,260
...我不太喜欢你对看手相的反应
...I kind of didn't really like this reaction at the palm reader.

361
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:48,830
就象只好斗的公鸡
You were like this rooster prick.

362
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,900
什么叫好斗的公鸡?
What the hell is a rooster prick?

363
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:52,600
你象个哭闹的孩子...
You were like a boy whining...

364
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:55,470
...因为所有注意力都不在你身上
...because all the attention wasn't focused on him.

365
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,770
好吧,听着,那女人蒙蔽了你,对吗?
All right, listen.This woman robs you blind, okay?

366
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,310
你象个路过冰淇淋店的小孩...
You were like a boy walking by an ice-cream store...

367
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,280
...因为妈妈不给他买奶昔而哭闹
...crying because his mom won't buy him a milk shake.

368
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:07,550
我不在乎那江湖骗子说过什么--
I don't care what this charlatan has to say about--

369
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,880
什么?
What?

370
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,230
我懂一点,但他不懂,抱歉
I understand a little,but he doesn't at all.

371
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,790
能问你个问题吗?
May I ask you a question?

372
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:27,040
我想和你们做个交易
So I would like to make a deal with you.

373
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:33,140
我不直接向你们要钱,而是让你们说一个词
I mean, instead of just asking you for money, I will ask you for a word.

374
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:37,950
你们给我一个词,然后我会写一首诗
You give me a word, I take the word,and then I will write a poem...

375
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:39,650
...将它包含在内
...with the word inside.

376
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:43,360
如果你们喜欢我的诗...
And if you like it,if you like my poem...

377
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,320
...觉得它能给你们的生活增添色彩...
...if it adds something to your life in any way...

378
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:49,160
...那就随意给我一些报酬
...then you can pay me whatever you feel like.

379
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:51,820
当然,我会用英语来写
I'll write in English, of course.

380
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:54,760
-行   -行,很不错
-Okay. -All right. Great.

381
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:58,430
那么?
So?

382
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:01,840
选个词吧
Pick a word.

383
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:04,800
一个词
A word.

384
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:08,610
-奶昔  -奶昔?哦,不错
-Milk shake. -Milk shake? Oh, good.

385
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:13,350
-我想说"好斗公鸡"的,不过挺好,奶昔   -奶昔?
-I was gonna say "rooster prick." But great. Milk shake.  -"Milk shake"?

386
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:15,690
好的,奶昔
Okay, milk shake.

387
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,350
好了,那么...
-All right, so.... -Good.

388
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:33,640
我喜欢这个维也纳人变相的乞讨方式
I gotta say, I like this viennese variation of bum.

389
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,940
我喜欢他"给生活增添色彩"那句话
I like what he said about adding something to your life.

390
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:40,950
我们刚才是不是有了第一次争执?
So, were we having our first fight back there?

391
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,480
我觉得是争执过
I think so. I think we were.

392
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,280
就算有,为什么大家都觉得冲突很糟糕呢?
Even if we were, why does everyone think conflict is so bad?

393
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:51,320
争执能带来很多好的事物
There's a lot of good things coming out of conflict.

394
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,260
对,我也这样想
Yeah, I guess so.

395
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,890
我常想如果自己能面对现实...
I always think if I could just accept the fact...

396
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:01,030
...面对生活中可以预见的艰难之处...
...that my life was supposed to be difficult, that's what's expected...

397
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,070
...也许就不会那么郁闷
...then I might not get so pissed off.

398
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:06,070
遇到好事时会为之高兴
And I'd just be glad when something nice happens.

399
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:07,770
所以我还在上学
That's why I'm still in school.

400
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,470
这样可以提高竞争能力
It's easier to have something to fight against.

401
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:14,410
我们骨子里都有这种强烈的好胜心
Well, we've all had such competitiveness ingrained in us.

402
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:17,980
你也知道,我可以做一些无聊的事
You know, I can be doing the most nothing thing.

403
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:20,520
投飞镖或是打台球
Throwing some darts or shooting some pool.

404
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,550
然后很自然地产生这种想法
Then all of a sudden,I feel it come over me.

405
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,990
我必须赢
I have got to win.

406
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,650
你邀我一起下车也是出于好胜心吗?
Is that why you tried to get me off the train? Competitiveness?

407
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,200
你是指什么?
What do you mean?

408
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,300
写好了
I got a poem.

409
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:36,230
哦,是吗
Oh, all right.

410
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:39,600
能念给我们听吗?
Will you read it to us?

411
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,640
当然可以
Sure. Okay.

412
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,620
白日梦般的错觉
"Daydream delusion

413
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:53,050
豪华车竟有睫毛
Limousine eyelash

414
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:56,290
哦,宝贝,你的脸如此美丽
Oh, baby, with your pretty face

415
00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:01,530
坠一滴泪入我的酒杯看着那双大眼睛
Drop a tear in my wine glass Look at those big eyes

416
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,920
明白到你对我的意义
See what you mean to me

417
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:07,130
犹如蛋糕和奶昔
Sweetcakes and milk shakes

418
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,600
我是迷人的天使
I am a delusion angel

419
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,330
我是奇幻的展台
I' m a fantasy parade

420
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:16,780
想让你明白我的心思不要再继续猜量
I want you to know what I think Don't want you to guess anymore

421
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:19,380
你不知我来自何处
You have no idea where I came from

422
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,650
我们不知该前往何方
We have no idea where we're going

423
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,710
只管融入生活
Lodged in life

424
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,480
就象河流的支脉
Like branches in the river

425
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:28,620
奔腾而下,随波逐流
Flowing downstream Caught in the current

426
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:30,380
我中有你
I carry you

427
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,150
你中有我
You'll carry me

428
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:34,590
就该是这样
That's how it could be

429
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,460
你明白我了吗?
Don't you know me?

430
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:40,260
现在你明白我没有?
Don't you know me by now? "

431
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,700
太棒了
Great.

432
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:45,600
-谢谢   -谢谢,伙计
-Thanks. -Thanks, man.

433
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:50,440
给你
Here you go.

434
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:53,940
-谢谢   -不用
-Thanks. -All right.

435
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:56,340
-给,谢谢你   -谢谢
-Here. Thank you. -Thank you.

436
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:57,450
祝你好运
Good luck.

437
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:15,430
写得很棒,是吧?
It was wonderful, no?

438
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:22,770
-怎么了?   -那可能不是他写的
-What?   -He probably didn't just write that.

439
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:25,640
也许他只是加了一个词进去
He wrote it, but he probably plugs that word in.

440
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:28,110
不管是"奶昔"还是什么
You know, whatever, "milk shake."

441
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,910
你想说什么?
What do you mean?

442
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,310
没什么,我喜欢,很不错
Nothing. I loved it. It was great.

443
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:42,590
知道什么让我发疯吗?人们谈论...
You know what drives me crazy?People talking about...

444
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,490
...科技如何伟大,如何节省时间
...how great technology is,how it saves all this time.

445
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:51,240
但节省了时间却变得更加忙碌,不加以利用又有何意义呢?
But what good is saved time if nobody uses it?If it just turns into more busy work.

446
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:58,980
从没听人说要用文字处理器节省的时间去寺庙游玩
I never hear anybody say, "With the time I've saved using my word processor I'm gonna go to a Zen monastery and hang out

447
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:02,340
-从没听说过  -时间太抽象了
-You don't hear that. -Time is so abstract anyway.

448
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:05,180
-你在看那个女孩?  -什么?
-Are you looking at this girl? -What?

449
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:06,750
没什么
Nothing.

450
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:08,820
想进去吗?
You wanna go in here?

451
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:12,480
-想不想进去?  -行啊,是夜总会对吧?
-You wanna go in here? -Yeah. It's a club, no?

452
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,580
进去?
Wanna go?

453
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:16,890
你好
Hello.

454
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:20,600
50先令
Fifty schillings.

455
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,700
-每个人  -我这有100,给
-Each.  -I got 100. Here, I got it.

456
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:26,700
我请你喝啤酒,谢谢
I'll buy you a beer. Thank you.

457
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:16,920
-你请我喝啤酒?  -对
-You gonna buy me a beer? -Yeah.

458
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:23,520
这里的美国啤酒贵不贵?
You think Old Milwaukee is expensive here?

459
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:55,230
我们还没说过你是否正在和谁交往吧?
We haven't talked about this yet,but are you dating anyone?

460
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:59,800
例如有男朋友什么的正等着你回巴黎
You got a boyfriend waiting on you back in Paris or anything like that?

461
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,800
-不,现在没有  -但以前有
-No, not right now. -But you did.

462
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:05,900
我们6个月前分手了
We broke up six months ago.

463
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:08,600
6个月前?哦,真遗憾
Six months ago? Oh, I'm sorry.

464
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:11,540
这话题就不那么有趣了,说说看
I mean, I'm not that sorry.Tell me about it.

465
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:15,510
不,太无聊了我不想说
No way. I can't.It's really, really boring.

466
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,680
来吧,跟我说说
Come on. Tell me about it.

467
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:21,720
好吧,我很失望
I was really disappointed.

468
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,950
原以为能维持一段时间,可他...
I thought this one would last for a while. He was...

469
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:29,230
...愚蠢,粗鲁,没情趣,酗酒....
...very stupid, ugly,bad in bed, alcoholic....

470
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:32,730
纯粹是个草包
-You know.-A real prize winner.

471
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:35,770
我是想给他留点面子
I was kind of giving him a favor.

472
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:38,730
但他离开了我,说什么我太爱他...
But he left me,saying I loved him too much.

473
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:43,670
妨碍了他的所谓狗屁艺术表现力
I was blocking his artistic expression or some shit like that.

474
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:47,010
不管怎样,我很受伤害,变得--
But anyway, I was traumatized and became--

475
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:49,850
由于他而变得很困惑
And became totally obsessed with him.

476
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:53,480
所以去看心理医生,编了个...
So I went to a shrink, and it came up that I had written...

477
00:55:53,690 --> 00:56:00,490
...关于女人想杀死她男友及如何下手的愚蠢故事...
...this stupid story about this woman trying to kill her boyfriend and how she'd do it.

478
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:04,030
...所有怎样下手又不会被抓的细节
It's all the details of how to do it and not get caught--

479
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:06,220
她想杀死男朋友?
She was gonna kill her boyfriend?

480
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:12,470
是的,我不会真去做,只是编的罢了
Yeah, she was. It's nothing I would do,but it was just some writing.

481
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:13,940
是的,我明白
No, I understand.

482
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:16,970
愚蠢的医生相信了我说的一切
This stupid shrink believed everything I told her.

483
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:20,880
是我第一次就诊,她说必须通知警察
It was my first time seeing her.She said she had to call the police.

484
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,980
她必须通知警察?
She had to call the police?

485
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:27,480
她完全相信我会付诸行动
She was totally convinced I was really gonna do it.

486
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:30,620
即使我解释那只是我编造的
Even though I had explained it was just some writing.

487
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:33,760
她看着我的眼睛说"你说的这些...
She said, looking into my eyes,"The way you said it...

488
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,830
...我知道你会去做"
...I know you are going to do it."

489
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:38,590
她纯粹是疯了
She was totally out of her mind.

490
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,960
那是我唯一一次看心理医生
It was my first and last session.

491
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:43,930
那么后来呢?
So what happened then?

492
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:47,900
我彻底忘记了他
I totally got over him.

493
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:49,670
现在我烦恼的是...
But now, I'm obsessed...

494
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:54,370
...如果他死于千里之外的一场事故
...that he's gonna die from an accident or 1000 kilometers away.

495
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,910
受指控的将是我
And I'm gonna be the one accused.

496
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:04,090
为什么我们会为不那么喜欢的人感到困惑呢?
Why is it you become obsessed with people you don't really like that much?

497
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:05,660
不知道
I don't know.

498
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,060
那你呢?
So how about you?

499
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:13,260
-什么?  -和谁在一起?
-What?  -Are you with anyone?

500
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:18,940
我们一直回避这个话题可真滑稽
It's funny how we managed to avoid this subject for so long.

501
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:20,900
可你现在得告诉我
But now you have to tell me.

502
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:23,300
我对爱的注脚是--
Well, I kind of see love...

503
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:27,740
两个不知该如何独处的人的庇荫
...as this escape for two people who don't know how to be alone.

504
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:32,020
真有趣,人们总是说...
It's funny.People always talk about how...

505
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:35,020
...爱是完全无私的付出
...Iove is this totally unselfish,giving thing.

506
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:38,490
但细想想却除了自私什么都没有
But if you think about it,there's nothing more selfish.

507
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,590
我明白
I know.

508
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:43,360
那么,你刚和谁分手?
So who just broke up with you?

509
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,460
什么?
What?

510
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:51,070
听起来你象是受了伤害
You sound like you just were hurt.

511
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:52,570
我?
Do I?

512
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,100
好吧
All right.

513
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,710
我承认
Big confession.

514
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,040
我应该早告诉你的
I should've told you this earlier or something.

515
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:03,520
我来欧洲不只是为了..
I didn't come to Europe just to...

516
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,910
...在巴黎散心,读海明威
...hang out and read Hemingway in Paris and shit like that.

517
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:10,950
整个春季我都在攒钱,想去马德里...
I saved up my money all spring to fly to Madrid...

518
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,720
...和我的女友共渡夏季...
...and spend the summer with my girlfriend--

519
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:15,660
-你的女友?   -前女友
-Your girlfriend? -My ex-girlfriend...

520
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:19,200
...过去一年来她一直在学艺术史
...who has been on this art history program for the last year.

521
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,800
总之,我到了这,久别重逢...
Anyway, I got here.We were reunited at long last...

522
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,130
...第一晚是和她的6个朋友一起出去吃饭
...and we went out to dinner our first night with six of her friends.

523
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,970
佩德罗,安东尼奥,冈萨罗...
Pedro, Antonio, Gonzalo...

524
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:32,340
...玛丽娅,老乡苏茜
...Maria, Suzy from home.

525
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:35,910
好几天她都设法回避和我独处...
She managed to avoid being alone with me for the first few days...

526
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:40,750
...慢慢我意识到她并不希望我来
...and I stuck around just to let it sink in that she wished I hadn't come.

527
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:46,290
于是买了从维也纳起飞的最便宜的机票
So I bought the cheapest flight out,this one leaving out of vienna.

528
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:49,990
几周内没有航班,所以我又买了火车票
It didn't leave for a couple weeks,so I bought this Eurail pass.

529
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:54,790
知道别人和你分手最糟糕的事是什么吗?
You know what's the worst thing about somebody breaking up with you?

530
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,500
是当你记起自己很少想到...
It's when you remember how little you thought about...

531
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:02,440
...与之分手的人,并意识到...
...the people you broke up with,and you realize...

532
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,270
...他们也很少想到你
...that that is how little they're thinking about you.

533
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,780
你以为双方都会感觉痛苦...
You'd like to think you're both in pain...

534
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:11,980
...实际上却是"嘿,很高兴你离开"
...but really, they're just,"Hey, I'm glad you're gone."

535
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:14,620
相信我,我懂
Believe me, I know.

536
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:16,850
你该注意积极的一面
You should look at bright colors.

537
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,420
是那个心理医生告诉我的
That's what the shrink told me.

538
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:23,220
我付她900法郎1小时...
I was paying her 900 francs an hour...

539
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:25,730
...来倾听我是个杀人狂
...to hear that l was a homicidal maniac...

540
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:29,990
...如果我注意积极的一面就能消除我的困惑
...but I could shift my obsession if I would concentrate on bright colors.

541
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,470
管用吗?
Did it work?

542
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:37,070
-对玩弹球没帮助  -对,没有
-Didn't help your pinball. -Well, no.

543
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:41,480
是的,要知道最近我没杀任何人
Yeah, well, you know,I haven't killed anyone lately.

544
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,010
近来没有?
Not lately?

545
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,220
真不错,你康复了
That's good.You're cured then.

546
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:54,890
有种猴子,它们整天都在交配...
There's breeds of monkeys,and all they do is have sex...

547
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:56,660
...从早到晚
...all the time.

548
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:59,090
它们因此而最少攻击性...
And they turn out to be the least violent...

549
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:02,270
...最平和,最快乐
...the most peaceful, the most happy.

550
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:04,960
所以鬼混未必就是坏事
So maybe fooling around's not so bad.

551
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:08,300
-你是在说猴子吧?  -是啊
-Are you talking about monkeys? -Yes, I am.

552
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:09,870
-我想也是  -怎么?
-I thought so. -Why?

553
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:16,420
我从没听说过,这恐怕是雄性为他们鬼混找的完美借口
I never heard this one.But it reminds me of this perfect male argument to justify them fooling around.

554
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:20,050
母猴子也可以啊,大家都可以
Women monkeys are fooling around too.Everybody's fooling around.

555
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:25,450
真有趣,我有个可怕而偏激的念头...
That's cute. I have this awful,paranoid thought...

556
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:28,860
...女权主义是男人创造的,好让他们...
...that feminism was mostly invented by men so they could...

557
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:30,360
...更方便鬼混
...fool around more.

558
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,730
"女人,解放头脑,解放身体,和我睡觉
"Woman, free your mind,free your body. Sleep with me.

559
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:38,460
"我们都是快乐自由的,只要能满足我的色欲"
We're all happy and free, as long as I can fuck as much as I can."

560
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:40,210
好了,好了
All right.

561
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:43,710
这也许包含有生物学的因素
But maybe there's some biological things at work here.

562
01:00:43,910 --> 01:00:45,440
如果你有个岛...
If you had an island...

563
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:50,280
...岛上有99个女人和1个男人...
...and there were 99 women on the island and only one man...

564
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,280
...1年后也许会多出99个孩子
...in a year, you'd have the possibility of 99 babies.

565
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:56,790
但如果岛上是99个男人和1个女人...
But if you have an island with 99 men and only one woman...

566
01:00:56,990 --> 01:01:01,650
...1年后就只可能有一个孩子,所以....
...in a year, you have the possibility of only one baby. So....

567
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:02,930
你知道吗?
You know what?

568
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:07,290
我猜岛上也许只会留下43个男人
On this island, I think there will be only, like, maybe 43 men left.

569
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:11,400
为了和那可怜的女人性交他们会互相残杀
They would've killed each other trying to fuck this poor woman.

570
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:15,840
而另一个岛上会有99个女人,99个孩子
And on the other island,there would be 99 women, 99 babies...

571
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,700
...但不再有男人
...and no more man.

572
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:20,470
因为她们会把他生吃掉
Because they would've all eaten him alive.

573
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:22,080
哦,是吗?
Oh, yeah?

574
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,010
对此可以这样说
There's something to that.

575
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:28,380
某种程度上,女人并不介意毁掉一个男人
On some level, women don't mind the idea of destroying a man.

576
01:01:29,590 --> 01:01:32,460
我曾和我的前女友一起逛街...
I was walking down the street with my ex-girlfriend...

577
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:37,150
...有4个长相凶恶的人站在一辆跑车附近
...and we'd just walked by these four thuggy-looking guys next to a Camaro.

578
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,530
其中一个说"嘿,宝贝,屁股真漂亮"
And one of them says,"Hey, baby. Nice ass!"

579
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:44,400
我觉得"这没什么,没必要为此生气"
So I'm like, "No big deal.I won't get uptight about this."

580
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:46,160
对,而且他们有4个人
Plus, there were four of them.

581
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:49,340
就是,可她说"去你妈的,混蛋"
Exactly. But she says,"Fuck you, dickheads!"

582
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:52,740
我想,"这下好了,等着瞧吧"
And I'm like, "Okay.Wait a minute, here."

583
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:55,510
他们可不会过来踢她的屁股
They're not gonna come over and kick her ass.

584
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:58,650
那么谁会被顶到前线上去呢?
So who just got pushed to the frontline on that one?

585
01:01:58,850 --> 01:02:01,820
女人说她们讨厌被严加保护
Women say they hate it if you're all protective.

586
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:06,390
如果照她的意思去做,又说你不是男人
But if it suits them, then they'll tell you you're being unmanly.

587
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:10,720
知道吗?我不认为女人真的想毁掉男人
You know what? I don't think woman really wants to destroy man.

588
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:14,000
即使她们想也不会成功
Even if they want to,they don't succeed.

589
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,400
我相信恰恰是男人在毁掉女人...
I'm sure even men are destroying women...

590
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,660
...或者说相对而言更有能力毁掉女人
...or are capable of destroying women much more than women--

591
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:22,170
总之,这令人沮丧,懂我意思吗?
Anyway, it's depressing.You know what?

592
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:24,970
-你想停止这个话题?  -我讨厌这些
-You wanna stop talking about this? -I hate it.

593
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:26,740
男人,女人,这...
Men, women, it's....

594
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:29,440
永无休止,就象...
There's no end to it.

595
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:31,470
就象张跳针的唱片
It's like a skipping record.

596
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:34,880
凡是夫妻都会永远讨论这问题
Every couple's been having this conversation forever.

597
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:37,180
但没人能得出结论
And nobody came up with anything.

598
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:56,280
我看过记录片说这是生育舞蹈
I saw a documentary on that.It's a birth dance.

599
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,940
生育舞蹈?
A birth dance?

600
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:28,070
我该给她钱吗?
Should I give her some money?

601
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,580
所有有意思的事都要花钱
Everything that's interesting costs a little money.

602
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:35,110
生育舞蹈,是吧?
So a birth dance, huh?

603
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:38,050
在我看来有点象交配舞蹈
Looked a little bit like a mating dance to me.

604
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:41,050
不,是真的,女人临盆时就跳这个
No, but really.Women used it when giving birth.

605
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:43,660
世上仍有一部分人这么做
In part of the world,they still do it.

606
01:03:44,890 --> 01:03:47,360
临产的女人进到帐蓬里...
The woman in labor enters a tent...

607
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:50,160
...同部落的女人围着她跳舞
...and the women of her tribe surround her and dance.

608
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,660
并鼓励她一起跳
They encourage her to dance with them...

609
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:55,160
...可以减轻分娩的痛苦
...so as to make the birth less painful.

610
01:03:55,370 --> 01:03:58,810
孩子降生后大家一起起舞庆贺
And when the baby is born,they all dance in celebration.

611
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:02,200
我猜我妈妈可不会这样做
I don't think my mom would've gone for that.

612
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:06,940
我喜欢跳舞这类所有人都能参与的活动
I like the idea of dancing as something everybody participates in.

613
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:10,280
我知道,我听说有个老头...
I know. I heard about this old guy...

614
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,610
...他看到年轻人在跳舞
...who was watching some young people dance.

615
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:14,220
说道,"真美
He said, "How beautiful.

616
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:17,360
"他们甩掉生殖器以变成天使"
They're shaking off their genitals to become angels."

617
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:18,460
有意思
I like that.

618
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:19,850
不过有个问题
One question, though.

619
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:23,720
当女人们全身心地投入到舞蹈中时...
When the women are dancing and being all spiritual and stuff...

620
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:25,020
...男人们在哪?
...where are the men?

621
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:29,530
出去找食物了?没被邀请?还是女人不需要男人?
Are we out food gathering? Are we not invited? You all don't need us?

622
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:32,030
男人该庆幸没在交配后被咬下头颅
Men are lucky we don't bite off their heads after mating.

623
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:35,210
实际上象蜘蛛什么的会那样做
Certain insects do that,like spiders and stuff?

624
01:04:35,410 --> 01:04:37,810
能活着还有什么可抱怨的呢?
We let you live.What are you complaining about?

625
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:41,640
你这是危言耸听,话里有话
See, you're officially kidding.But there's something to that.

626
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:43,980
你一直在强调某些观点
You keep bringing stuff like that up.

627
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:48,020
不,没有,等一等,说正经的
No, no. Wait a minute.Talking seriously here.

628
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:53,950
我一直觉得要做一个坚强而独立的女强人...
I mean, I always feel this pressure of being a strong and independent icon of womanhood...

629
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:59,490
...不让自己的全部生活围着某个男人转有很大的压力
...and not making it look like my whole life is revolving around some guy.

630
01:05:01,070 --> 01:05:06,040
但是爱一个人和被人爱对我来说意味着很多
But loving someone and being loved means so much to me.

631
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:09,040
我常拿这类事情说笑...
I always make fun of it and stuff...

632
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,070
...可并非我们做的每件事...
...but isn't everything we do in life...

633
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:15,150
...都能赢得更多的爱
...a way to be loved a little more?

634
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:20,820
我不知道
I don't know.

635
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,190
有时候我梦想着...
Sometimes I dream...

636
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:26,420
...做一个好父亲好丈夫
...about being a good father  and a good husband.

637
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:29,090
而且有时候会觉得很接近了
And sometimes it feels really close.

638
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,660
可另外一些时候...
But then other times...

639
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:34,760
...这想法似乎很蠢
...it seems silly...

640
01:05:34,970 --> 01:05:36,440
...仿佛它会
...like it would...

641
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,600
...毁掉我全部的生活
...ruin my whole life.

642
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:42,440
不是由于对责任感的畏惧...
And it's not just a fear of commitment...

643
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:45,770
...或是没有能力去关爱,因为
...or that I'm incapable of caring or loving because...

644
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:47,210
...我能胜任
...I can.

645
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:52,250
如果我绝对公正地对待自己...
It's just that, if I'm totally honest with myself...

646
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:54,180
...那我宁死也不想知道...
...I think I'd rather die knowing...

647
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:56,910
...我擅长些什么
...that I was really good at something.

648
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:05,590
比起仅仅维系一份良好的,友爱的关系来说,还有哪些方面更突出
That I had excelled in some way than that I'd just been in a nice, caring relationship.

649
01:06:11,810 --> 01:06:15,210
我曾为一个老人工作,有次他告诉我...
I had worked for this older man,and once he told me...

650
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:19,070
...他把一生的心思都放在了事业上
...that he had spent all of his life thinking about his career.

651
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,580
52岁时他突然地发现...
He was 52,and it suddenly struck him...

652
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:25,450
...他从没为自己做过任何事
...that he had never really given anything of himself.

653
01:06:25,790 --> 01:06:28,220
他这辈子毫无作为
His life was for no one and nothing.

654
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,860
他说这话时都要哭了
He was almost crying saying that.

655
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:37,330
我相信如果有神存在...
I believe if there's any kind of God...

656
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:39,520
...不会存在于任何人身上
...it wouldn't be in any of us...

657
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:41,730
...不会是你或者我
...not you or me...

658
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:45,630
...而是存在于这小小的空间之中
...but just this little space in between.

659
01:06:48,110 --> 01:06:50,670
如果世上有什么奇迹...
If there's any kind of magic in this world...

660
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:55,280
...一定是尽力理解某个人,并与之同甘共苦
...it must be in the attempt of understanding someone sharing something.

661
01:06:57,550 --> 01:07:00,850
我知道,这几乎是不可能成功的
I know, it's almost impossible to succeed...

662
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:03,420
...可谁真正在乎呢?
...but who cares really?

663
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,960
答案一定是在尝试之中
The answer must be in the attempt.

664
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:19,190
我想文明正在衰亡,看看这服务吧
I think this is a civilization in decline. Look at the service.

665
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:22,840
侍者在哪?在纽约她肯定得失业
Where is the waitress?In New York, she'd be out of a job.

666
01:08:31,950 --> 01:08:34,110
我来给巴黎的一个朋友打电话
I'm gonna call my friend in Paris...

667
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:37,410
...我想约她午休时一起吃饭
...who I'm supposed to have lunch with in eight hours.

668
01:08:45,630 --> 01:08:46,850
接电话
Pick up.

669
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:48,990
-接电话啊  -好的
-Pick up the phone. -All right.

670
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:05,940
我正学英语,你说英语行吗?当作消遣
I've been working on my English.You wanna talk in English, for laughs?

671
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:08,780
行,这主意不错
Yeah, okay. That's a good idea.

672
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:14,010
我今天不能陪你吃午饭了,对不起
I don't think I'll be able to make it for lunch today.

673
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:19,420
我在火车上认识了一个人,和他在维也纳下了车
I met a guy on the train,and I got off with him in vienna.

674
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:21,650
你疯了吗?
Are you crazy?

675
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,100
也许吧
Probably.

676
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:27,590
-他是不是奥地利人?  -不,不是
-He's Austrian? He's from there? -No, No.

677
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:31,500
是个游客,美国人,明天一早就要回家
He's passing through. He's American.He's going back home tomorrow.

678
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:33,070
你为什么下车?
Why'd you get off?

679
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:36,710
他说服了我
Well, he convinced me.

680
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:41,410
实际上我在火车上和他聊过一阵之后...
I mean, actually, I was ready to get off the train with him...

681
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:43,580
...就打算和他一起下车
...after talking to him a short while.

682
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:45,810
他很有趣,让我情不自禁
He was so sweet, I couldn't help it.

683
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:49,650
在休息车厢,他谈到...
In the lounge car,he began to talk about...

684
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:52,950
...他小时候见过他曾祖母的鬼魂
...him as a boy seeing his great-grandmother's ghost.

685
01:09:54,330 --> 01:09:56,560
我就是那时被他吸引住了
I think that's when I fell for him.

686
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:01,500
就因为一个小男孩和他所有的美丽梦想
Just the idea of this little boy with all those beautiful dreams.

687
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:04,600
他征服了我
He trapped me.

688
01:10:07,810 --> 01:10:09,500
而且他很可爱
And he's so cute.

689
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:11,870
他有漂亮的蓝眼睛...
He has beautiful blue eyes...

690
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,070
...漂亮的粉红色嘴唇...
...nice pink lips...

691
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:16,510
...油腻的头发
...greasy hair.

692
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:18,810
我很喜欢
I love it.

693
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:22,020
他高高的个子,有点笨拙
He's kind of tall,and he's a little clumsy.

694
01:10:23,690 --> 01:10:26,120
我喜欢他偷偷看我的感觉
I like to feel his eyes on me when I look away.

695
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:33,920
他接吻时象个青涩少年,很可爱
He kind of kisses like an adolescent.It's so cute.

696
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:37,700
-不是吧?  -就是,我们接过吻,感觉非常棒
-What?  -Yeah, we kissed. It was so adorable.

697
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,730
随着夜色降临,我越来越喜欢他
As the night went on,I began to like him more and more.

698
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:45,200
我担心他有点怕我
I'm afraid he's scared of me.

699
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:49,370
我跟他说过一个女人想杀死前男友的故事
I told him the story about the woman that kills her ex-boyfriend.

700
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,350
他肯定怕得要命
He must be scared to death.

701
01:10:51,550 --> 01:10:54,820
他一定以为我是个专横歹毒的女人
He must be thinking I'm this manipulative, mean woman.

702
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:59,580
但愿他不会这样认为
I just hope he doesn't feel that way about me.

703
01:10:59,790 --> 01:11:02,760
因为,你了解我,我决不会伤害别人
Because, you know me,I'm the most harmless person.

704
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:07,170
唯一能真正伤害的只有我自己
The only person I could really hurt is myself.

705
01:11:08,070 --> 01:11:09,970
我不认为他会怕你
I don't think he's scared of you.

706
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:12,000
我想他对你很着迷
I think he's crazy about you.

707
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,730
-真的?  -我认识你很久了
-Really? -I've known you a long time.

708
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:17,410
对你印象很好,你还会再见他吗?
I got a good feeling.You gonna see him again?

709
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:22,610
我们还没提到这个问题
We haven't talked about that yet.

710
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:29,980
好,到你了,打电话给你的朋友
Okay, it's your turn.You call your friend.

711
01:11:30,190 --> 01:11:32,090
好的,好的
All right, all right.

712
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:38,020
通常只能接通他的答录机
I usually get this guy's answering machine.

713
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:42,360
嘿,哥儿们,什么事?
Hi, dude. What's up?

714
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:47,140
弗兰克,过得怎样?真高兴你在家
Hey, Frank. How you been?I'm glad you're home.

715
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:48,770
挺好,是的
Cool. Yeah.

716
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:50,530
马德里怎么样?
So how was Madrid?

717
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:53,300
没劲透了
Madrid sucked.

718
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:56,640
莉莎和我总算彻底玩完了
Lisa and I had our long overdue meltdown.

719
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:59,080
太糟了,我早说过不是吗?
Too bad. I told you, no?

720
01:11:59,290 --> 01:12:02,450
对,相隔太远从不会有结果
Yeah, yeah. The long-distance thing just never works.

721
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:04,680
我只在马德里呆了几天
I was only in Madrid for a couple days.

722
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:07,550
我买了张最便宜的机票
I got a cheaper flight out of vienna.

723
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:12,790
实际上并不太便宜,只不过...
You know, it really wasn't that much cheaper. I just....

724
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:17,230
我不能马上回家,我不想见到任何熟人
I couldn't go home right away.I didn't want to see anybody I knew.

725
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:20,200
只想变成完全不为人知的游魂
I just wanted to be a ghost,completely anonymous.

726
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,210
你现在还好吧?
So are you okay now?

727
01:12:23,410 --> 01:12:26,440
对,我很好,很好,真的
Yeah. I'm great. I'm great.That's the thing.

728
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:28,010
我很开心
I'm rapturous.

729
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,210
告诉你是为什么
And I'll tell you why.

730
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:33,320
在欧洲最后一晚我认识了一个人
I met somebody on my last night in Europe.

731
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,220
-难以置信  -我知道,我知道
-That's incredible. -I know, I know.

732
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:39,790
有句老话说我们是对方的魔鬼和天使
You know how they say we're all each other's demons and angels?

733
01:12:40,830 --> 01:12:44,190
她无疑是波提且利画笔下的天使
Well, she was literally a Botticelli angel...

734
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,020
...告诉我一切都会好起来
...telling me everything would be okay.

735
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,200
你们怎么认识的?
How did you meet?

736
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:54,270
是在火车上
On the train.

737
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:57,900
她邻座的一对古怪夫妻在吵架
She was sitting next to a weird couple that was fighting...

738
01:12:58,110 --> 01:13:01,270
...她换座时正好坐在过道对面
...so she moved. She sat right across the aisle from me.

739
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:03,420
于是我们开始聊天
So we started to talk.

740
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:05,810
起初她不太喜欢我
She didn't like me much at first.

741
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:07,180
她非常聪明...
She's super smart...

742
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:10,080
...充满激情...
...very passionate...

743
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:11,850
...而且很漂亮
...and beautiful.

744
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:15,880
我却太缺乏自信
And I was so unsure of myself.

745
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:18,930
我觉得我说的话都很蠢
I thought everything I said sounded so stupid.

746
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,830
哦,伙计,这我并不担心
Oh, man. I wouldn't worry about that.

747
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,700
她不会因此而对你有成见
No, I'm sure she was not judging you.

748
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:29,510
再说了,她坐到了你旁边
No, and by the way,she sat next to you.

749
01:13:29,710 --> 01:13:31,440
我相信她是有意如此
I'm sure she did it on purpose.

750
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:32,980
哦,是吗?
Oh, yeah?

751
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:40,550
我们男人太蠢了,一点也不了解女人
Us men are so stupid. We don't understand anything about women.

752
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:44,310
她们行为古怪,我只知道这一点
They act strange,the little I know of them.

753
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,220
对不对?
Don't they?

754
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:57,170
我觉得我们象是处在梦境之中
I feel like this is some dream world we're in.

755
01:13:57,370 --> 01:13:58,960
对,这很奇怪
Yeah, it's so weird.

756
01:13:59,370 --> 01:14:01,570
仿佛我们在一起的时间只属于我们
It's like our time together is just ours.

757
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,610
是我们自己创造的
It's our own creation.

758
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:07,370
就象我在你梦里,你在我梦里
It must be like I'm in your dream and you're in mine.

759
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:11,550
所以这一整夜才会如此美妙...
And what's so cool is that this whole evening...

760
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:15,240
...客观地说我们本来是不会在一起的
...all our time together,shouldn't officially be happening.

761
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:18,910
我明白,所以才会感觉象在童话世界
Yeah, I know. Maybe that's why this feels so otherworldly.

762
01:14:21,030 --> 01:14:24,620
不过天亮之后我们就会变回南瓜,对不对?
But then the morning comes and we turn into pumpkins, right?

763
01:14:25,370 --> 01:14:26,800
我明白
I know.

764
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:30,730
但是现在,你该拿出玻璃鞋...
But now, you're supposed to produce the glass slipper...

765
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:32,530
...看看合不合适
...and see if it fits.

766
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:37,040
会合适的
It'll fit.

767
01:14:55,560 --> 01:15:00,690
我有个朋友的孩子是在家里出生的,所以他在那帮忙
This friend of mine had a kkid and it was a home birth,so he was there helping out.

768
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:03,700
他说生命降生之时的意义非凡
But he said at that profound moment of birth...

769
01:15:05,170 --> 01:15:08,940
...他看着他的孩子第一次体验生命
...he was watching his child experiencing life for the first time...

770
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:11,080
...试着第一次呼吸
...trying to take its first breath.

771
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:17,040
他能想到的却只是眼前这个生命总有一天将会死去
All he could think about was that he was looking at something that was gonna die someday.

772
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:19,480
他无法驱散这个念头
He couldn't get it out of his head.

773
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:23,810
我觉得很真实,一切事物都是有限的
And I think that's so true.Everything is so finite.

774
01:15:24,090 --> 01:15:26,850
你是否觉得正因为这样...
But don't you think that's what...

775
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:30,390
...才使我们的时间和特殊时刻如此重要?
...makes our time and specific moments so important?

776
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:31,460
是的,我明白
Yeah, I know.

777
01:15:31,830 --> 01:15:33,990
就象我们今晚一样
It's the same for us tonight, though.

778
01:15:36,970 --> 01:15:40,630
过了明天,我们也许永远都不会再见面
After tomorrow, we'll probably never see each other again, right?

779
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:44,770
你不认为我们还能见面?
You don't think we'll ever see each other?

780
01:15:47,450 --> 01:15:48,710
你觉得呢?
What do you think?

781
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:58,890
老实说,我不知道,我没有其他旅游计划
Actually, I don't know.I hadn't planned another--

782
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:02,650
我也是,我在巴黎,你在美国,我能理解
Me too. I live in Paris,you live in the U.S. I understand.

783
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:05,630
我不想让你来,你讨厌飞行不是吗?
I'd hate to make you fly.You'd hate to fly, right?

784
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,060
我并不那么害怕飞行
I'm not so scared of flying.

785
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:09,960
我是说我可以
I mean, I could.

786
01:16:10,170 --> 01:16:11,860
是吗,如果你想...
Well, if you were gonna...

787
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:13,660
...来美国...
...come to the U.S...

788
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:15,310
...或者,也许我...
...or if, you know, if l....

789
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:17,940
我是说,我可以再来这
I mean, I could come back here.

790
01:16:19,010 --> 01:16:20,170
怎么了?
What?

791
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:24,250
我们该以成年人的理性来对待这事
No, let's just be rational adults about this.

792
01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:28,880
我们该尝试不同的方式
We should try something different.

793
01:16:29,090 --> 01:16:32,320
就算今晚是我们仅有的一晚也不错不是吗?
It's not so bad if tonight is our only night, right?

794
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:35,530
大家交换电话,住址
People exchange numbers, addresses.

795
01:16:35,730 --> 01:16:38,560
结果只通过一两封信,一两次电话
They end up writing once,calling each other twice.

796
01:16:38,770 --> 01:16:40,530
是的,结果很糟
Right. Fizzles out.

797
01:16:40,830 --> 01:16:43,320
我不想那样,我讨厌那样
Yeah, I don't want that.I hate that.

798
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:45,930
我也讨厌那样
I hate that too.

799
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:49,840
为什么大家都认为关系应该永远保持呢?
Why does everybody think relationships should last forever?

800
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:52,170
是啊,为什么?真蠢
Yeah, why? It's stupid.

801
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:56,570
你觉得今晚就是...
But you think tonight's it?

802
01:16:56,850 --> 01:17:00,340
我是指,这就是我们仅有的一晚吗?
I mean, that tonight's our only night?

803
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:04,410
只能这样不是吗?
It's the only way, no?

804
01:17:07,530 --> 01:17:08,860
那好吧
Well, all right.

805
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:11,660
就这样
Let's do it.

806
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,330
不欺骗,不猜忌
No delusions, no projections.

807
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:17,730
只管把今晚过好
We'll just make tonight great.

808
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:21,630
好,就这么办
Let's do that.

809
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:41,360
我们应该握握手
We should do some kind of handshake.

810
01:17:41,830 --> 01:17:43,090
把手给我
Give me your hand.

811
01:17:46,570 --> 01:17:49,500
为了我们唯一一个...
To our one and only...

812
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:51,830
...共处的夜晚...
...night together...

813
01:17:52,570 --> 01:17:55,130
...以及余下的时间
...and the hours that remain.

814
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:04,770
怎么了?
What?

815
01:18:07,590 --> 01:18:08,880
这真是...
It's just....

816
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:11,050
令人沮丧是不是?
It's depressing, no?

817
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:14,820
此刻我们唯一要想的就是...
Now, the only thing we're gonna think of is...

818
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:16,960
...我们必须说再见的时刻
...when we'll have to say goodbye.

819
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,760
可以现在就说,那样就不用担心了
We could say goodbye now.Then we won't worry about it.

820
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:22,290
现在?
Now?

821
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:24,260
说再见
Say goodbye.

822
01:18:24,470 --> 01:18:25,960
-再见   -再见
-Bye.  -Goodbye.

823
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:28,510
再见
Au revoir.

824
01:18:28,710 --> 01:18:30,470
-再见   -再见
-Later. -Later, yeah.

825
01:19:00,810 --> 01:19:01,870
这样好了
Here's the plan.

826
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:05,370
你去偷杯子,我去弄酒
You're gonna grab the glasses,and I'm gonna get the wine.

827
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:07,570
-红酒  -红酒,行
-Red wine. -Red wine. Right.

828
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:10,910
-你觉得能弄到吗?   -别担心
-You think you can do that? -No problem.

829
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:17,990
-祝我好运   -祝你好运
-Wish me luck. -Good luck.

830
01:19:19,930 --> 01:19:21,050
你好
Hello.

831
01:19:25,570 --> 01:19:26,860
你会说英语吗?
Do you speak English?

832
01:19:27,070 --> 01:19:29,130
-会一点  -会一点是吗?
-A bit.  -Yeah? A bit?

833
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:31,960
我有件棘手的事...
I'm having kind of an odd situation...

834
01:19:32,170 --> 01:19:33,970
...是这样....
...which is that....

835
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:36,240
看到那边那女孩了吗?
You see that girl over there?

836
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:43,110
这是我们在一起的唯一一晚
Well, this is our only night together...

837
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:45,310
...而她...
...and she....

838
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:50,690
问题在于她想要瓶红酒...
The problem is that she wants a bottle of red wine...

839
01:19:50,890 --> 01:19:53,050
...可是我身无分文
...and I don't have any money.

840
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:57,930
我想你也许能...
But I was thinking that you might want to...

841
01:19:58,970 --> 01:20:02,530
...给我这家酒吧的地址,我保证...
...give me the address of this bar,and I would promise...

842
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:06,970
...寄钱给你,而你能成全我们这一夜
...to send you the money, and you'd be making our night complete.

843
01:20:07,070 --> 01:20:09,600
-你会寄钱给我?  -是的
-You would send me the money? -Yes

844
01:20:14,610 --> 01:20:15,880
你保证?
Your hand?

845
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:34,430
敬你一生中最美好的夜晚
For the greatest night in your life.

846
01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:36,330
太感谢你了
Thank you very much.

847
01:21:00,030 --> 01:21:03,620
我经常和别人一起分享美好时刻...
So often I've been with people and shared beautiful moments...

848
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:07,890
...例如旅游或彻夜不眠等着看日出
...like traveling or staying up all night and watching the sunrise.

849
01:21:08,770 --> 01:21:11,330
我知道那都是特别的时刻
And I knew those were special moments.

850
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:14,170
但总有不如意的地方
But something was always wrong.

851
01:21:15,310 --> 01:21:17,540
我希望是和另外的人在一起
I wished I'd been with someone else.

852
01:21:19,310 --> 01:21:21,470
我知道那种感觉...
I knew that what I was feeling...

853
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:25,740
...实际上对我很重要,他们不会明白
...exactly what was so important to me,they didn't understand.

854
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:32,410
但我很高兴和你在一起
But I'm happy to be with you.

855
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:37,630
你不会知道为什么这样一夜...
You couldn't know why a night like this...

856
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:40,320
...对我的生活来说有多重要
...is so important to my life right now...

857
01:21:40,530 --> 01:21:41,930
...但确实重要
...but it is.

858
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:47,010
这是个美妙的早晨
This is a great morning.

859
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:49,340
是个美妙的早晨
It is a great morning.

860
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,940
你觉得我们可以更进一步吗?
Do you think we have others like this?

861
01:21:56,920 --> 01:22:00,040
那我们的理性和成年人的决定怎么办?
What about our rational, adult decision?

862
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:01,910
哦，是呀
Oh, yeah.

863
01:22:06,290 --> 01:22:09,520
我明白你说的希望的人不在是指什么
I know what you mean about wishing somebody wasn't there.

864
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,500
通常,我自己...
It's just, usually, it's myself...

865
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:14,860
...会希望可以远远躲开
...that I wish I could get away from.

866
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:17,400
说真的,想想看
Seriously, think about this.

867
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:20,130
我从没去过任何...
I have never been anywhere...

868
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:22,030
...我没去过的地方
...that I haven't been.

869
01:22:22,580 --> 01:22:24,910
从没有一个吻...
I've never had a kiss...

870
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:27,140
...是我没有吻过的
...when I wasn't one of the kissers.

871
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:29,210
从没有...
You know, I've never...

872
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:32,650
...看过我不在场时看过的电影
...gone to the movies when I wasn't there in the audience.

873
01:22:32,850 --> 01:22:35,450
从没打过我没参与的保龄球
I've never been out bowling if I wasn't there...

874
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:37,210
...制造一些愚蠢的笑话
...making some stupid joke.

875
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:40,320
所以才会有那么多人讨厌自己,真的
That's why so many people hate themselves. Seriously.

876
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:42,650
他们渴望死亡...
It's just, they are sick to death...

877
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:45,130
...徘徊在自己周围
...of being around themselves.

878
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:49,600
如果我们一直呆在一起
Let's say that you and I were together all the time.

879
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,030
你会开始讨厌我的坏习惯
You'd start to hate a lot of my mannerisms.

880
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:53,970
包括...
The way...

881
01:22:54,170 --> 01:22:57,400
...每次我们有客人来访...
...the way every time that we would have people over...

882
01:22:58,010 --> 01:23:01,240
...我变得不可靠,我喝过了头
...I'd be insecure, and I'd get a little too drunk.

883
01:23:02,050 --> 01:23:05,810
或是我反复讲些愚蠢,自作聪明的故事...
Or the way I tell the same stupid,pseudo-intellectual story...

884
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:07,780
...翻来覆去地说...
...again and again.

885
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,680
那些故事我都听过...
You see, I've heard all those stories...

886
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:14,590
...所以我当然会厌恶自己
...so of course I'm sick of myself.

887
01:23:18,730 --> 01:23:20,220
但和你在一起...
But being with you...

888
01:23:22,470 --> 01:23:25,130
...让我觉得自己象是另一个人
...it's made me feel like I was somebody else.

889
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:30,840
象这样能让人忘我的其他方法只有...
I mean, the only other way to lose yourself like that is...

890
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:33,940
...你也知道,跳舞...
...you know, dancing...

891
01:23:34,310 --> 01:23:36,250
...酒精...
...or alcohol...

892
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,750
...毒品,诸如此类
...or drugs, or stuff like that.

893
01:23:42,290 --> 01:23:43,550
做爱?
Fucking.

894
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:47,950
作爱,对,也是方法之一
Fucking, yeah. That's one way.

895
01:24:02,310 --> 01:24:04,070
知道我想要什么吗?
Do you know what I want?

896
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:06,570
什么?
What?

897
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,510
有人吻我
To be kissed.

898
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:16,450
这我能做到
Well, I could do that.

899
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:31,490
等等
Wait.

900
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:37,740
我得说几句傻话
I have to say something stupid.

901
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:40,400
没问题
All right.

902
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:43,510
非常傻
It's very stupid.

903
01:24:46,650 --> 01:24:48,810
我觉得我们不该发生关系
I don't think we should sleep together.

904
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:55,620
我很想,但以后我们永远都不会再见面
I want to, but since we're never going to see each other again...

905
01:24:55,830 --> 01:24:57,730
...这让我很难受
...it'll make me feel bad.

906
01:24:58,630 --> 01:25:01,360
我会猜你和谁在一起,会想你
I'll wonder who else you're with.I'll miss you.

907
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:09,240
我知道,这不太成熟
I know. It's not very adult.

908
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:12,310
也许是女人的天性,我控制不住
Maybe it's a female thing.I can't help it.

909
01:25:12,850 --> 01:25:14,680
那我们就再见面
Let's see each other again.

910
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:21,410
我不希望你为了和我作爱而破坏约定
No, I don't want you to break our vow just so you can get laid.

911
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:25,890
我不只是想,而是--我是说...
I don't want to just get laid.I want to-- I mean....

912
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:28,520
我觉得我们应该作爱
I mean, I think we should.

913
01:25:29,630 --> 01:25:31,790
我们早上就会死去不是吗?
We die in the morning, right?

914
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:36,130
-所以应该   -那就象男人的梦想
-I think we should. -Then it's like some male fantasy.

915
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:39,530
邂逅一个法国女郎,干了她然后永不再见
Meet a French girl,fuck her and never see her again.

916
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:43,330
而且有个好故事可说了,我可不想...
And have this great story to tell.I don't want...

917
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:46,270
...这个美好的夜晚变成那样
...this great evening to just have been for that.

918
01:25:47,110 --> 01:25:50,640
好的,我们不用作爱,那没什么大不了
Okay, we don't have to have sex.It's not a big deal.

919
01:26:01,530 --> 01:26:03,500
你不想再见到我?
You don't want to see me again?

920
01:26:04,930 --> 01:26:06,190
不,我当然想
No, of course I do.

921
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:08,990
如果现在有人让我选择...
If somebody gave me the choice right now...

922
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:12,100
...永远不再见你还是娶你
...of to never see you again or to marry you...

923
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:13,430
...我会娶你
...I would marry you.

924
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:15,800
也许是所谓的浪漫过头
Maybe that's a lot of romantic bullshit...

925
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:18,740
但有人结婚的理由比这更少
...but people have gotten married for a lot less.

926
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:23,010
事实上...
Actually...

927
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:29,750
...我们下火车时我决定要和你睡觉
...I think I decided I wanted to sleep with you when we got off the train.

928
01:26:33,390 --> 01:26:36,290
聊了这么多之后我拿不定主意了
Now that we've talked so much,I don't know anymore.

929
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:49,470
我们干嘛把一切变得这么复杂?
Why do we make everything so complicated?

930
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:51,170
我不知道
I don't know.

931
01:27:52,970 --> 01:27:56,700
回到巴黎你首先想要做什么?
What's the first thing you'll do when you get back to Paris?

932
01:27:57,180 --> 01:27:58,730
给父母打电话
Call my parents.

933
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:00,340
你呢?
What about you?

934
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:04,810
不知道,也许会去拿狗,它在我朋友那
I don't know. I'll probably go pick up my dog. He's with a friend.

935
01:28:05,020 --> 01:28:06,450
你有只狗?我喜欢狗
You have a dog?I love dogs.

936
01:28:06,650 --> 01:28:08,280
-是吗?  -是的
-You do? -Yeah.

937
01:28:08,620 --> 01:28:10,520
-哦,该死  -怎么了?
-Oh, shit. -What?

938
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:14,120
说不清,我们回到现实中来了
I don't know.We're back in real time.

939
01:28:14,530 --> 01:28:16,220
是的,令我讨厌
I know. I hate that.

940
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:17,860
是什么?
What is that?

941
01:28:19,930 --> 01:28:21,960
听起来象古钢琴
Sounds like a harpsichord.

942
01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:24,060
去看看
Check that out.

943
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:26,230
有人在演奏
Somebody's playing.

944
01:28:33,010 --> 01:28:34,040
真酷
That's cool.

945
01:28:52,630 --> 01:28:54,900
我们能随着琴声起舞吗?
Can we dance to the harpsichord?

946
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:56,470
当然
Of course.

947
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:01,430
哦，哇
Oh, wow.

948
01:29:01,610 --> 01:29:02,530
怎么?
What?

949
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:07,410
我要拍下你的照片
I'm gonna take your picture...

950
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:10,670
...那就永远不会忘记你...
...so I never forget you...

951
01:29:12,990 --> 01:29:14,250
...和这一切
...or all this.

952
01:29:15,020 --> 01:29:16,650
好的,我也一样
Okay, me too.

953
01:30:15,050 --> 01:30:18,510
"岁月会象兔子一样溜走"
"The years shall run like rabbits."

954
01:30:21,050 --> 01:30:22,180
什么?
What?

955
01:30:24,260 --> 01:30:25,590
没什么
Nothing.

956
01:30:27,490 --> 01:30:31,920
我有张唱片是戴伦-托马斯...
I have this recording of Dylan Thomas

957
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:34,190
...朗诵W.H.奥登的诗
...reading a W. H. Auden poem.

958
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:37,060
他有副好嗓子
He's got a great voice.

959
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,200
比如...
It's like....

960
01:30:41,540 --> 01:30:43,740
"城里所有时钟
"All the clocks in the city

961
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:46,740
"开始当当响着报时
Began to whirr and chime:

962
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:49,470
"不要让时间欺骗你
'O let not Time deceive you

963
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:52,280
"你不可能征服时间
You cannot conquer Time.

964
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:54,710
"在烦恼与忧虑之中
In headaches and in worry

965
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:57,950
"朦胧的生活消逝无踪
vaguely life leaks away

966
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:00,390
"时间占有了他的幻想
And Time will have his fancy

967
01:31:00,590 --> 01:31:03,190
"明天或是今天"
Tomorrow or today.' "

968
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:05,390
就象这样
Something like that.

969
01:31:06,370 --> 01:31:07,560
不错
That's good.

970
01:31:15,170 --> 01:31:19,040
你说过在最初的几年之后...
When you talked earlier about after a few years...

971
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:21,870
...一对夫妻怎样开始彼此厌恶...
...how a couple would begin to hate each other...

972
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:24,050
...由于彼此太了解...
...by anticipating their reactions...

973
01:31:24,250 --> 01:31:26,270
...或是厌倦了对方的恶习
...or getting tired of their mannerisms.

974
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:29,390
我觉得我恰恰相反
I think it would be the opposite for me.

975
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:34,890
我彻底了解一个人时就会真正爱上他
I think I can really fall in love when I know everything about someone.

976
01:31:36,130 --> 01:31:37,790
他怎样梳理头发...
The way he's gonna part his hair...

977
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,120
...哪一天穿哪件衬衣...
...which shirt he's gonna wear that day...

978
01:31:40,330 --> 01:31:44,560
...知道在什么场合他会说什么故事
...knowing the exact story he'd tell in a given situation.

979
01:31:46,270 --> 01:31:48,800
这时候我肯定就爱上他了
I'm sure that's when I know I'm really in love.

980
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:12,790
-嘿,糟糕   -怎么了?
-Hey, guess what. -What?

981
01:32:13,170 --> 01:32:15,130
我们没去看那场话剧
We didn't go to those guys' play.

982
01:32:15,330 --> 01:32:16,560
话剧?
Play?

983
01:32:16,770 --> 01:32:18,100
那头母牛?
The cow?

984
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:20,030
是啊,我们没去
Oh, yeah, we didn't.

985
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:22,470
哦,不,我们错过了
Oh, no. We missed it.

986
01:32:48,170 --> 01:32:50,160
你知道去机场的公车吗?
You know what bus to take to the airport?

987
01:32:50,370 --> 01:32:51,270
是的,别担心
No problem.

988
01:32:51,470 --> 01:32:54,870
-我就上这趟车   -到了,你就上去吗?
-I should get on this one. -Right here. You wanna get on there?

989
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:00,610
那就这样了,是吗?
I guess this is it, no?

990
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:03,770
我真的...
I really....

991
01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:11,490
-要知道...   -我知道,我也是
-You know.... -Yeah, I know. Me too.

992
01:33:18,130 --> 01:33:21,620
祝你生活顺利,事事开心
Have a great life. Have fun with everything you're gonna do.

993
01:33:21,830 --> 01:33:24,200
也祝你学业和一切顺利
Good luck with school and all that.

994
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,860
我知道统计显示"不,不,不,它很安全"
I know the statistics say,"Na, na, na, it's safer." Whatever.

995
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,190
但我乘飞机时就会看到爆炸
When I'm in a plane,I can see the explosion.

996
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,700
我看到我从云端坠落
I can see me falling through the clouds.

997
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:26,170
我非常害怕那几秒钟的意识...
And I'm so scared of those few seconds of consciousness...

998
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,780
...在临死之前,你知道自己快要死了的时候
...before you die.When you know you're gonna die.

999
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,980
我总忍不住会这样想
I can't stop thinking that way.

1000
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,620
那让人筋疲力竭
It's exhausting.

1001
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,380
是的,没错
Yeah, I bet.

1002
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,390
真的筋疲力竭
Really exhausting.

1003
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,760
-我想这是维也纳了   -是的
-I think this is vienna. -Yeah.

1004
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,800
-你在这下,是吗?   -是的,真扫兴
-You get off here, no?  -Yeah, what a drag.

1005
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:54,700
早认识你就好了,我很喜欢和你聊天
I wish I'd met you earlier.I really like talking to you.

1006
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,240
我也是
Yeah, me too.

1007
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,170
很高兴能认识你
It was really nice of you too.

1008
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,270
我有个无疑是疯狂的想法,但要是不问你的话...
I have an admittedly insane idea,but if I don't ask you this...

1009
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,500
...我下半辈子都会耿耿于怀的
...it'll haunt me the rest of my life.

1010
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,440
是什么?
What?

1011
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,420
我想继续跟你聊天,尽管我对你一无所知...
I want to keep talking to you.I have no idea what your situation is...

1012
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,360
...但我觉得我们似乎...
...but I feel like we have some kind of...

1013
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,990
似曾相识,同意吗?
...connection. Right?

1014
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,350
是的,我同意
Yeah. Me too.

1015
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,590
那就好,是这样
Right. Great.Here's the deal.

1016
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,200
跟我一起下车游览维也纳
Get off here in vienna and come check out the town.

1017
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,060
-什么?   -来吧,肯定很有意思
-What?  -Come on. It'll be fun.

1018
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,200
-来吧   -我们做些什么?
-Come on. -What would we do?

1019
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:07,000
不知道,我只知道我的飞机是明早9:30
I don't know. All I know is I catch a flight tomorrow morning at 9:30...

1020
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:10,580
...而且我没钱住旅馆了,所以只好到处走走...
...and I can't afford a hotel,so I was going to walk around...

1021
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,650
...如果你和我同行会更有意思
...and it'd be more fun if you came with me.

1022
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:16,580
如果你觉得我不正常,你可以改乘下一班火车
And if I turn out to be a psycho,just get on the next train.

1023
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,020
好吧,好吧,设想一下
All right, all right.Think of it like this.

1024
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,120
10年20年之后,懂吗?
Jump ahead 10, 20 years, okay?

1025
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,490
你结婚之后
And you're married.

1026
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,530
你的婚姻失去了曾经有过的活力
Only your marriage doesn't have that same energy it used to have.

1027
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,730
你开始责备你的丈夫
You start to blame your husband.

1028
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,870
你回想你一生中曾遇见过的所有男人...
You think about all those guys you've met in your life...

1029
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,730
...设想嫁给他们中的一个会发生什么
...and what might've happened if you'd picked up with one of them.

1030
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,930
我就是其中之一,就是我
I'm one of those guys.That's me.

1031
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,010
就当这是个时空旅行...
So think of this as time travel...

1032
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:47,150
...来到现在,看看你当时错过了什么
...from then to now to find out what you're missing out on.

1033
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:53,480
那会有极大的帮助,你会发现并未错过任何东西
What this could be is a gigantic favor to you and your husband to find out you're not missing anything.

1034
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,680
我只是个和他一样的失败者,缺乏目标,无所事事
I'm just as big a loser as he is.Unmotivated. Boring.

1035
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,520
你做了正确的选择,为此而开心
You made the right choice.You're happy.

1036
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,870
我去拿我的包
Let me get my bag.

1037
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,660
我们该找个地方寄存行李
We should get a locker for all this.

1038
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,900
你叫什么?
What's your name?

1039
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,230
我吗?
My name?

1040
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,970
杰西,实际上是詹姆斯,但大家都叫我杰西
Jesse. James, actually,but everybody calls me Jesse.

1041
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,340
那就是杰西-詹姆斯,对吗?
You mean, Jesse James, no?

1042
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,840
不,就是杰西
No. No, just Jesse.

1043
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,070
我叫塞琳娜
I'm Celine.

1044
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,220
这座桥真漂亮
This is a nice bridge.

1045
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,690
是的
Yeah.

1046
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,630
感觉怪怪的
This is kind of weird.

1047
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,570
是吗?我觉得有点尴尬
Isn't it? I mean,I feel a little awkward.

1048
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,580
-但没关系不是吗?   -是的,这非常棒
-But it's all right. Right? -Yeah, this is great.

1049
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:27,550
-找些地方看看吧  -好的,我们找找看
-Let's go to some places.  -Yeah, let's go to some places.

1050
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,240
-我去问问这些人  -好的
-Let's ask these guys.  -Okay.

1051
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,820
抱歉,打扰一下
Excuse me. Excuse me?

1052
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,750
你们会说英语吗?
SprEchEn siE English?

1053
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,420
-当然会  -能不能换成你说德语?
-Ja. Of course. -Do you speak German for a change?

1054
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,420
-什么?  -开个玩笑
-What?  -No, it was a joke.

1055
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:43,430
我们今天刚到维也纳,想找些有意思的地方看看
We just got into vienna today, and we' re looking for something fun to do.

1056
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,360
例如博物馆,展览会...
Like museums, exhibitions....

1057
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:49,000
但最近博物馆没什么意思
But museums are not that funny anymore these days.

1058
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:53,510
他们马上就要关门了,你们会在这逗留多久?
They are closing right now.How long are you going to be here?

1059
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,900
就一个晚上
Just for tonight.

1060
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,250
你们为什么来维也纳?你们想看些什么?
Why did you come to vienna?What could you be expecting?

1061
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,450
我们在渡蜜月
We' re on honeymoon.

1062
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,740
是的,她怀孕了,我们不得不结婚...
Yeah, she got pregnant,we had to get married....

1063
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,420
得了吧,你不懂撒谎
I don't believe you.You're a bad liar.

1064
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:18,300
我们有场演出,很乐意邀请你们观看
This is a play we're both in.We would like to invite you.

1065
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,800
你们是演员?

是关于一头母牛和寻找它的印第安人

1071
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,720
-他演母牛  -是的,我演母牛
-He's the cow. -Yes, I am the cow.

-但这头牛有点古怪  -它得了一种病
-And the cow's a bit weird. -The cow has a disease.

1073
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,660
它的行为有点怪异,象只狗
She's acting a bit strange.Like a dog.

1074
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,490
有人扔根棍子的话,它会去叼回来
If someone throws a stick,she fetches it.

1075
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,930

The big Ferris wheel?We should go. We should.

1080
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,570
你们可以在开演之前先去普拉特
Perhaps you can go to the Prater before the play.

1081
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,610
演出是21:30开始
It starts at 2130.

00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:15,580
翻译过来就是"带给我威尔明顿的母牛角"
It translates as "Bring Me the Horns of Wilmington's Cow."

1086
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,880
我就是威尔明顿的牛
I'm Wilmington's cow.

1087
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,860
-好的  -太棒了

1090
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,370
再见

1091
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,420
我有个主意,你准备好没有?

1092
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,290
是个问答游戏,我们已经互相有所了解
It's Q and A time.We've known each other a little while.

1093
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:53,490
我们是同伴了,所以可以相互问几个直接的问题
We're stuck together, so we'll ask each other a few direct questions.

1094
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,820
行吗?
All right?

1095
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,100
-我们互相提问?  -但你必须老实回答
-We ask each other questions? -And you have to answer honestly.

1096

让-马克-弗勒里?
Jean-Marc Fleury?

1104
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:27,460
我们一起参加夏令营,他是个游泳运动员
We were at this summer camp together,and he was a swimmer.

1105
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,070
有一头被氯漂白的头发和绿眼睛
He had bleached-out chlorine hair and green eyes...

1106
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:34,530
为了提高成绩他刮掉了腿上和手臂上的毛
...and to improve his times,he'd shave his legs and arms.

1107
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,170
-真恶心   -就象只光洁的海豚
-That's disgusting.  -He was like this gorgeous dolphin.

1108
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,600
我的朋友艾玛对他很着迷
My friend Emma had a big crush on him.

1109
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:44,250
有一天,我穿过营地回我的房间
So one day, I was cutting across the field back to my room...

1110
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,180
他走到我身边,我告诉他
...and he came walking up beside me.I told him...

1111
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,780
"你该和艾玛约会,她对你很着迷"
..."You should date Emma.She has a big crush on you."

1112
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,550
但他转过身对我说
And he turned to me and said...

1113
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,620
"那太糟了,因为我对你很着迷"
..."Well, that's too bad, because I have a big crush on you."

1114
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,990
是的,那真让我感到意外
So, yeah, it really scared the hell out of me...

1115
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,390
...因为我觉得他太优秀
...because I thought he was so fine.

1116
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:07,570
然后他正式向我提出约会,我假装不喜欢他
Then he officially asked me on a date.I pretended I didn't like him.

1117
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:13,110
要知道我很害怕自己可能做的事
You know, I was so afraid of what I might do, you know.

1118
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:18,210
我去看了几次他的游泳比赛
So I went to see him swim a few times at the competition.

1119
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,440
他很性感,真的,我是说非常性感
And he was so sexy. Really.I mean, really sexy.

1120
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:26,150
那个夏季末我们写下了一些爱的宣言
We wrote these little declarations of love at the end of the summer...

1121
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,760
我们保证要一直通信
...and, you know, promised we would keep writing forever...

1122
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,220
还有要尽快再见面
...and meet again very soon and--

1123
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,490
见了吗?
Did you?

1124
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,190
当然没有
Of course not.

1125
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:40,260
我可以告诉你我是个非常棒的游泳选手
Then this is the opportune time to tell you I'm a fantastic swimmer.

1126
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,070
-真的吗?   -当然
-Really?   -Yeah.

1127
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,310
-我会记录下来   -没问题

-现在轮到我了吧?  -是的,轮到你了
-So it's my turn. No?  -Yes, your turn.

1129
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,410
问吧
Hit me.

1130
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,110
你曾经恋爱过吗?
Have you ever been in love?

1131
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,880
是的
Yes.

1132
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,210
下一个问题

1133

1134
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:02,060

-So I can give one-word answers?  -Why not?

1135
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,130
我可是详细描述过我初次的性经验
After I went into detail about my sexual feelings?

1136
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:09,790
因为问题不同,我可以回答性体验的事
They' re different questions. I could answer the sexual-feelings thing.

1137
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,700
但你要知道,爱-- 如果我问你是否恋爱过你会怎么回答?
But, you know, love-- I mean,what if I asked you about love?

1138
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,670
我会说假话,但我至少会编造一个美妙的故事
I would have lied, but at least I would have made up a great story.

1139
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,470
爱是个复杂的问题,明白吗?
Love is a complex issue, you know?

1140
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:25,410
我想是的,我告诉过一些人我爱他们,而且我是认真的
I mean, yes, I've told somebody that I love them, and I've meant it.

1141
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,850
但爱是完全无私的付出吗?
But was it totally unselfish,giving love?

1142
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,950
爱是一件美好的事吗?
Was it a beautiful thing?

1143
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,210
不完全是,它就象,爱...
Not really.

1144
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,620
我想我无法说清
I mean, I don't know.

1145
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,190
你明白吗?

1146
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,960
-是的,我明白你的意思   -至于性体验...
-Yeah. I know what you mean. -But as far as sexual feelings go...

-听说过   -知道克里斯托吗?
-I've heard of it. -You know Crystal?

1150
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:54,730
你不知道克里斯托?哈,我认识她
You don't know Crystal?Well, I knew Crystal.

1151
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,570
该轮到我了?
Is it my turn now?

1152
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,470
告诉我一件你特别生气的事
Tell me something that really pisses you off.

1153
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,240
-让你气得发疯   -让我生气
-Really drives you crazy.  -Pisses me off.

-God, everything pisses me off. -List a couple.

1155
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,790
哦,我知道,我讨厌被陌生男人搭讪...
Oh, I know. I hate being told by strange men...

1156
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,860
...街上的陌生男人...
...strange men in the street...

1157
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:18,860
...你知道的,笑脸让他们觉得生活不那么无聊
...you know, to smile to make them feel better about their boring life.

1158
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,490
还有呢?
What else?

1159
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,030

I hate that 300 kilometers from here,there's a war...

1161
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,140
...人们在死亡,但没人知道该怎么做
...people are dying,and nobody knows what to do.

1162
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,640
也许根本不在乎,我说不清
Or they don't give a shit.I don't know.

1163
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:34,480
我讨厌媒体试图控制我们的思想

-The media?  -Yeah, the media.

1165
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,050
很难形容,是一种新的法西斯主义
It's very subtle, but it's a new form of fascism, really.

1166
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,080

Ten thousand years ago,there's, like, two million people.

1192
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:55,890
而现在世界上有50到60亿人口
Now there's between five and six billion people on the planet.

1193
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,730
如果我们都有属于自己独有的...
If we all have our own individual, unique...

1194
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,900
...灵魂...
...soul...

1195
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,130
...那他们是从何而来的呢?
...where did they all come from?

1196
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,930
现代人的灵魂只是原有灵魂的一部分吗?
Are modern souls only a fraction of the original souls?

1197
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,140
如果是的话,就表示每个灵魂在过去5万年...
If they are, that represents a 5000 to 1 split of each soul...

1198
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:15,080
...分裂成了5000个,对地球而言只是一瞬间
...in the last 50,000 years, which is a blip in the Earth's time.

1199
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:20,220
我们最多只是人类史上微不足道的一部分
So at best, we're these tiny fractions of people walking

1200
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:24,760
所以我们才这么分散?所以我们才这么独特?
Is that why we're so scattered?Is that why we're so specialized?

1201
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,520
等等,我不太--
Wait a minute, I'm not sure--

1202
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:30,190
是的,我知道,这完全是不着边际的想法
Yeah, I know, I know.It's a totally scattered thought.

1203
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,330
不过这样才有点意义
Which is kind of why it makes sense.

1204
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,700
我同意
I agree with you.

1205
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,840
我们还是下车吧
Let's get off this damn train.

1206
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,240
这里很不错
This place is pretty neat.

1207
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,430
是的
Yeah.

1208
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,980
还有个试听室呢
There's even a listening booth.

1209
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,050
听说过这个歌手吗?
Have you heard of this singer?

1210
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,120
是美国人,有个朋友跟我提起过
I think she's American.A friend told me about her.

1211
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:33,660
想看看试听室是否还能用吗?
Do you want to go see if that listening booth still works?

1212
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,060
当然想
Yeah, okay.

1213
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,360
~北面吹来一阵风
There's a wind that Blows in from the north

1214
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:22,410
~诉说着爱意的来临
And it says that loving Takes this course

1215
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:25,400
~来吧
Come here

1216
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,210
~来吧
Come here

1217
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:36,420
~不,我并非不可亲近
No, I'm not impossible to touch

1218
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:41,490
~我从未如此需要过你
I have never wanted you so much

1219
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,630
~来吧
Come here

1220
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,670
~来吧
Come here

1221
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:55,040
~是否我从未躺在你身旁
Have I never laid down by your side

1222
00:27:56,110 --> 00:28:00,910
~宝贝,让我们抛开矜持
Baby, let's forget about this pride

1223
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,080
~来吧
Come here

1224
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:09,250
~来吧
Come here

1225
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,960
看看这,太美了
Look at this. This is beautiful.

1226
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,700
快,车要开了
Quick. It's leaving.

1227
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,860
看,有只兔子
Look, there's a rabbit.

1228
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,470
对
Yeah.

1229
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,090
你好,兔子
Hey there, rabbit.

1230
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,670
它真可爱
It's so cute.

1231
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,680
我十多岁时来过这
I visited this as a young teenager.

1232
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:08,350
它当时留给我的印象比博物馆更深
It left a bigger impression on me at that time than the museums.

1233
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,350
是吗?它很小
Yeah? It's tiny.

1234
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,650
我知道
I know.

1235
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,350
和我们聊天的墓地管理员是个矮小老头
A little old man talked to us.He was the groundskeeper.

1236
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,390
他解释说大部分埋在这里的人...
He explained that most of the people buried here...

1237
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,120
...都是被多瑙河水冲上岸的
...had washed up on the bank of the Danube.

1238
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,100
有多久的历史了?
How old are these?

1239
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,370
大约始建于本世纪初,被称为无名公墓
Around the beginning of the century.It's called No Name Cemetery...

1240
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:31,170
...因为他们大都不知道姓甚名谁
...because they often didn't know who those people were.

1241
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,470
要不就是有名无姓
Maybe a first name, that's all.

1242
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,710
为什么所有尸体都是冲上岸的?
Why were all the bodies washing up?

1243
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:39,850
我猜有些是因为船只失事之类的事故
I think some were from accidents on boats and things like that.

1244
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:43,350
但大部分是投河自尽的
But most of them were suicides that jumped in the river.

1245
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:49,090
我喜欢这种想法--无名之人从世上消失
I always liked the idea of all those unknown people lost in the world.

1246
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,350
我是小女孩时曾想过...
When I was a little girl,I thought...

1247
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,090
...如果没有任何亲友知道你已经死了...
...if none of your family or friends knew you were dead...

1248
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,260
...那就象没有真正死去
...then it's like not really being dead.

1249
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:59,370
大家可以替你作最好或最坏的设想
People can invent the best and the worst for you.

1250
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,930
我想她就在这
Here she is, I think.

1251
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:08,570
没错,这个我记得最清楚
Yeah, this is the one I remember the most.

1252
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:14,140
她死的时候只有13岁
She was only 13 when she died.

1253
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:18,950
在我来说意味深长,我第一次来这就是13岁
That meant something to me.I was that age when I first saw this.

1254
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:28,230
我现在长了10岁,可她还是13岁
Now I'm 10 years older,and she's still 13, I guess.

1255
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,520
这很有趣
That's funny.

1256
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,880
那边就是多瑙河
That's the Danube over there.

1257
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,050
是条河,对吧?
That's a river, right?

1258
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,280
是的
Yeah.

1259
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,820
真是...
This is...

1260
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,470
...壮观
...gorgeous.

1261
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:10,600
是啊,真美
Yeah, this is beautiful.

1262
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,070
我是指,我们赶上了...
I mean, we got....

1263
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,970
我们赶上了日落
We got a sunset here.

1264
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,280
-是的   -我们在摩天轮上
-Yeah.  -We got the Ferris wheel.

1265
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,180
这就象...
It seems like...

1266
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,480
...是个...
...this would be a....

1267
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,430
什么?
What?

1268
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,890
你知道的...
You know....

1269
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,510
你的意思是不是想吻我?
Are you trying to say you want to kiss me?

1270
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:55,800
你知道吗?
But you know what?

1271
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:58,950
生于哪个时代并不重要
It doesn't matter what generation you're born into.

1272
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,410
看看我的父母
Look at my parents.

1273
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:04,810
68年5月事件,愤怒的年轻人反对一切
They were angry, young May ' 68 people revolting against everything.

1274
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:08,790
政府,及其保守的天主教后台....
The government, their conservative Catholic backgrounds....

1275
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:12,480
我出生之后,我父亲成为成功的建筑师
Then I was born, and my father became a successful architect.

1276
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,720
他建造桥梁时我们周游世界...
We traveled around the world while he built bridges...

1277
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:18,160
...当然,还有塔和别的什么
...and, you know, towers and stuff.

1278
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:21,230
我是说,我真没什么可抱怨的
I mean, I really can't complain about anything.

1279
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,430
他们爱我胜过一切...
They love me more than anything...

1280
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,800
...我在他们努力营造的自由氛围中长大
...and I've been raised with all the freedom they fought for.

1281
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:30,040
对我而言这是另一种形式的抗争
And yet, for me now,it's another type of fight.

1282
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:33,580
我们总是面对相同的问题,却不知道...
We have to deal with the same shit,but we can't really know...

1283
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,130
我讨厌这样
I hate this.

1284
01:33:27,810 --> 01:33:30,330
我也是,火车就要开了
Me too.The train is about to leave.

1285
01:33:38,150 --> 01:33:40,850
要知道那些都是废话...
You know all this bullshit we're talking about...

1286
01:33:41,050 --> 01:33:43,610
...不再见面?我不愿意
...not seeing each other?I don't want that.

1287
01:33:43,820 --> 01:33:45,020
我也不想
I don't either.

1288
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:46,780
-你不想?   -我就是等这句话
-You don't? -I waited for you to say it.

1289
01:33:46,990 --> 01:33:48,550
你干嘛不说出来?
Why didn't you say something?

1290
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:50,920
我担心你不想再见我
I was afraid you didn't wanna see me.

1291
01:33:51,130 --> 01:33:52,390
你想怎么做?
What do you wanna do?

1292
01:33:53,530 --> 01:33:56,500
也许5年后我们可以在这见面
Maybe we should meet here in five years or something.

1293
01:33:56,700 --> 01:33:58,900
5年?那太久了
Five years? That's a long time.

1294
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:02,540
太恐怖了,象做社会学试验
It's awful. It's like a sociological experiment.

1295
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:04,770
-一年行不行?   -一年,好的
-How about one year? -One year.

1296
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:07,770
-6个月怎么样?  -6个月?
-How about six months? -Six months?

1297
01:34:08,650 --> 01:34:10,410
这里会很冷
It's gonna be freezing.

1298
01:34:10,620 --> 01:34:13,280
管它呢?在这见面然后去哪都行
Who cares? We come here,we go somewhere else.

1299
01:34:16,460 --> 01:34:18,390
从今天还是昨天算起?
Six months from now or last night?

1300
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:23,520
昨天,从昨天算起6个月后,是...
Last night. Six months from last night, which was...

1301
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:25,060
...6月16日
...June 16th.

1302
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:29,790
9号站台,从现在起6个月后晚上6:00
So track nine, six months from now at 6:00 at night.

1303
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:30,930
12月
December.

1304
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:35,070
你坐火车就行,可我却得飞越重洋
It's a train ride for you,but I gotta fly all the way here.

1305
01:34:35,270 --> 01:34:36,740
不过我会来的
But I'm gonna be here.

1306
01:34:36,940 --> 01:34:39,240
-好的,我也会   -好的
-Okay, me too. -All right.

1307
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:42,540
不打电话,不写信...
We won't call, write or--

1308
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:44,180
不,这太难受了
No, it's depressing.

1309
01:34:47,490 --> 01:34:49,250
火车要开了
Your train's gonna leave.

1310
01:34:49,450 --> 01:34:51,080
说再见吧
Say goodbye.

1311
01:34:51,790 --> 01:34:52,620
再见
Bye.

1312
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:55,150
再见
Goodbye.

1313
01:34:56,290 --> 01:34:57,490
再见
Au revoir.

1314
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:00,120
再见
Later.

1315
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,270
...是和谁对抗,敌人是什么
...who or, you know, what the enemy is.

1316
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:39,320
我不知道是否真有这么个敌人
I don't know if there really is an enemy.

1317
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,580
所有的父母都不会教育孩子
Everybody's parents fucked them up.

1318
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:45,250
有钱人的孩子父母给予得太多,穷人的孩子则相反
Rich kids' parents gave them too much.Poor kids', not enough.

1319
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,830
关爱太多,关爱不够
too much attention,not enough attention.

1320
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:51,260
或是遗弃或是教些错误的东西
They either left or taught them the wrong things.

1321
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:55,270
我父母是两个相爱并不太深的人...
My parents are just two people who didn't like each other much...

1322
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,340
...他们结婚,生子
...who got married and had a kid.

1323
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,870
然后尽力对我好
And they tried their best to be nice to me.

1324
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:04,040
-你父母离婚了?  -是的,最终离了
-Did your parents divorce? -Yeah, finally.

1325
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,480

他发现她怀孕时很恼火
That he was pissed off when he found out she was pregnant.
