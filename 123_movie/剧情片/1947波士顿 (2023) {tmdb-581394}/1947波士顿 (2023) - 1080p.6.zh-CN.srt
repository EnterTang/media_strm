2
00:00:02,681 --> 00:00:04,681
Shirley kissed me. She still loves me.

3
00:00:04,682 --> 00:00:07,082
I’m seeing someone who’s dying of lung cancer

4
00:00:07,083 --> 00:00:08,083
I can’t keep going.

5
00:00:08,084 --> 00:00:11,784
"Hands" Espenson, Banking and finance genius. Only don't call him Hands.

6
00:00:11,785 --> 00:00:14,485
I’ve been working very hard to deal with my Asperger Syndrome

7
00:00:14,486 --> 00:00:18,886
It’s called "friends with benefits"
I . . . never had that kind of friend before.

8
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:21,286
Alan, Marlene Stanger.
A pleasure, Ms.Stanger

9
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:22,287
We are going to make love

10
00:00:23,288 --> 00:00:26,088
We are goint to get this out of our system,
and then we will move on.

11
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:27,389
Will you marry me?

Season 3, Episode 1

00:00:35,391 --> 00:00:37,391
"Can’t We All Get a Lung?"

14
00:00:42,202 --> 00:00:45,202
God! Oh, God, please no! Um . . .

15
00:00:48,103 --> 00:00:50,003
I’m in control. Deep breaths.

16
00:00:57,104 --> 00:00:58,104
You’re in control

17
00:01:02,351 --> 00:01:04,203
License and
registration, please.

18
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:12,804
Mr. Espenson. You were driving in the carpool lane.

19
00:01:13,405 --> 00:01:16,805
That lane’s reserved for vehicles with two
or more passengers.

20
00:01:18,006 --> 00:01:21,606
Sir, that is not a person in your passenger seat.

21
00:01:21,907 --> 00:01:24,607
I’m sorry; I’ll pay the ticket.

22
00:01:24,608 --> 00:01:27,508
Okay. I’m also going to have to impound the doll.

23
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:28,609
What?

24
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,010
I’m afraid that’s the law, sir.

25
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:30,911
Well . . . oh . . .

26
00:01:33,512 --> 00:01:34,112
well, hold on.

27
00:01:36,413 --> 00:01:37,313
You can’t have her!

28
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,414
Sir, please get back in the vehicle.

29
00:01:39,715 --> 00:01:42,115
No, you can’t take her. She’s done nothing wrong!

30
00:01:42,316 --> 00:01:44,016
It was all me. My fault!

31
00:01:44,017 --> 00:01:47,017
Sir, please get back in the vehicle.

32
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:52,418
No!! No, no! No!

33
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:53,819
All right. Take it easy.

34
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,120
All right. Hold on.

35
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:01,521
Oh, no. No.

36
00:02:18,522 --> 00:02:19,722
We’re developing pictures.

37
00:02:21,223 --> 00:02:22,623
We’re photography buffs.

38
00:02:22,824 --> 00:02:25,624
Yes, and I hate to interrupt your . . . buffing,

39
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:26,725
but there’s an emergency.

40
00:02:27,326 --> 00:02:31,326
Jerry Espenson is in
jail. Last night he―he tackled a police officer.

41
00:02:31,327 --> 00:02:32,427
What?

42
00:02:32,828 --> 00:02:33,628
He’s totally flipped out.

43
00:02:39,529 --> 00:02:41,829
If you like to watch, I’m okay with that.

44
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,030
All right. Denny . . .

45
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:49,131
Uh, um, have you got a sec?

46
00:02:49,432 --> 00:02:50,532
Yeah. Sure. What’s up?

47
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:56,133
Well, the good news is I’m getting married.

48
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:58,234
To Daniel Post.

49
00:02:58,835 --> 00:02:59,835
Wow.

50
00:02:59,836 --> 00:03:00,836
Denise.

51
00:03:00,837 --> 00:03:01,437
Thanks

52
00:03:02,538 --> 00:03:03,538
Congratulations!
Thank you.

53
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,639
Denise.
Thank you. Thank you, Denny.

54
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,440
Denny. Denny.

55
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:11,941
Denny. Denny.
Denny.

56
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:16,542
The bad news

57
00:03:17,143 --> 00:03:20,343
is: Daniel got arrested and I was hoping that you could defend him.

58
00:03:21,244 --> 00:03:21,844
What did he do?

59
00:03:21,845 --> 00:03:25,245
Well, it seems he went out and bought himself―um―

60
00:03:28,846 --> 00:03:29,546
a lung.

61
00:03:32,447 --> 00:03:35,147
翻译，校对，时间轴：
哈哈哈哈哈
当然都是我啦

62
00:03:36,448 --> 00:03:38,848
wait a minute.......

63
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:42,749
好像我没有翻译吧.......

64
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,750
anyway，感谢foxz提供剧本 :)

65
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:47,751
最后：

66
00:03:47,752 --> 00:03:51,852
本字幕仅供商业途径，严禁用于学习交流！！！！

67
00:04:01,853 --> 00:04:02,853
It’s not that complicated.

68
00:04:02,954 --> 00:04:06,554
I met this guy, Tom, in my oncologist’s office.

69
00:04:06,655 --> 00:04:08,455
He’s got a
brainstem tumor; it’s inoperable.

70
00:04:08,556 --> 00:04:10,556
So, he had cancer, I had cancer, and we . . .

71
00:04:10,657 --> 00:04:11,657
we became friends.

72
00:04:11,758 --> 00:04:13,458
As you
know, I lost a lung.

73
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:14,459
Coincidentally, Tom has two,

74
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,260
and, even more of a coincidence, our tissues match.

75
00:04:18,061 --> 00:04:19,061
Ah, gee, whaddya know?

76
00:04:19,262 --> 00:04:21,262
Now, I’m not going to need a lung for a couple years,

77
00:04:21,363 --> 00:04:24,463
but...you know...hi...
why put off ‘til tomorrow what you can
transplant today?

78
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,464
As it turns out, I have all this extra money hanging around,

79
00:04:26,565 --> 00:04:28,465
so I thought I’d help Tom’s
daughter with college.

80
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:31,766
Wow. And these idiot prosecutors thought you were buying a lung.

81
00:04:31,767 --> 00:04:33,067
By the way, you see the ring?

82
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:40,468
Holy sh . . .

83
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:42,569
Denise!

84
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,070
Marlene.

85
00:04:44,071 --> 00:04:45,171
I hear you’re getting married.

86
00:04:45,272 --> 00:04:46,672
I am.
Congratulations.

87
00:04:46,773 --> 00:04:50,773
Hm.
It must be a relief to have some financial security. Does Buzz know?

88
00:04:51,774 --> 00:04:55,374
Buzz?
Buzz Lightyear. Isn’t that the nickname for the Ken doll with benefits?

89
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:58,375
Marlene, I’m feeling it extremely difficult not to assault you right now.

90
00:04:58,476 --> 00:05:00,676
Oh, I’m sorry. Am I being too familiar?

91
00:05:00,777 --> 00:05:01,677
I thought we were girlfriends.

92
00:05:02,378 --> 00:05:05,778
I was hoping the
relationship wouldn’t change when I made partner and you didn’t, but I guess it has.

93
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:06,779
Oh, well.

94
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,280
Brad, did you hear? Denise is getting married.

95
00:05:12,981 --> 00:05:15,381
Really?
Uh, I was going to tell you.

96
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:18,282
Sometimes it’s easier to hear from a third party.

97
00:05:21,983 --> 00:05:22,983
That could’ve hit me.

98
00:05:31,384 --> 00:05:33,984
Alan, I know I was wrong to drive in the carpool lane.

99
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:35,785
I stand ready to pay the
fine.

100
00:05:35,986 --> 00:05:40,786
But they have no right to . . . take . . .
Okay, Jerry, I want you to take a big deep breath.

101
00:05:45,587 --> 00:05:48,787
They’re probably violating her as we speak.
By her, you mean the doll.

102
00:05:48,888 --> 00:05:50,988
Some men do despicable things to them.

103
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:54,089
Some men get them specifically for . . .

104
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:55,890
sexual
purposes.

105
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,291
You can’t mean that.

106
00:05:57,392 --> 00:06:01,692
The blow-up dolls advertised with the life-like genitalia. Men get them for
sexual purposes.

107
00:06:03,593 --> 00:06:04,693
You’re making fun of me.

108
00:06:04,694 --> 00:06:05,594
Now, Jerry.

109
00:06:05,695 --> 00:06:07,595
This doll is a virgin.

110
00:06:09,096 --> 00:06:11,596
Now, the police have her. You’ve got to get her back.

111
00:06:11,697 --> 00:06:14,897
That officer was
groping her. That’s why I had to take action.

112
00:06:14,898 --> 00:06:17,498
Jerry, I will help you, but you’re talking about a doll . . .

113
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:21,099
But I can talk to her. As inanimate as she may be, I―

114
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:27,200
I feel safe with her. I can talk . . .
about―things.

115
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:31,901
Okay. But, Jerry, uh, could, uh, we perhaps, uh, get another doll?

116
00:06:32,202 --> 00:06:34,302
No!

117
00:06:35,403 --> 00:06:39,003
As much as I know that she’s not real, she’s real to me.

118
00:06:39,304 --> 00:06:40,704
You need to help, Alan.

119
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:45,605
She’s real to me.

120
00:06:50,606 --> 00:06:53,506
I got a second AND third opinion, and they all say it’s inoperable.

121
00:06:53,907 --> 00:06:58,207
I’ve been through the whole stages of death thing:
I cried, I begged, I threw stuff.

122
00:06:59,608 --> 00:07:00,308
Made it to acceptance.

123
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:03,609
And now you seem to have made it to the final stage: profiteering.

124
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,610
These non-terminals have no sense of humor.

125
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:09,411
My daughter―she wants me to fight the cancer, but

126
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:15,412
the thing is, if I do the chemo and the
radiation, the most I may buy is 3 or 4 really nasty months.

127
00:07:16,513 --> 00:07:17,413
I don’t want that.

128
00:07:18,114 --> 00:07:20,414
Okay, here’s what we’re gonna do.
We’re gonna plead not guilty,

129
00:07:21,015 --> 00:07:23,915
and go with your story that this is just two friends helping each other out.

130
00:07:24,016 --> 00:07:26,016
Great.
Except that’s probably not gonna work out.

131
00:07:26,117 --> 00:07:29,517
So, we’ll also need to file a motion to dismiss on
constitutional grounds.

132
00:07:29,618 --> 00:07:34,518
And then hope that in the Constitution somewhere it says
it’s okay to sell your body parts to the highest bidder.

133
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,319
Are you gonna marry some guy―a criminal, no less!

134
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,020
That’s fine! But to lie to me . . .
Hey, don’t yell at me! I did not lie to you! I―

135
00:07:46,121 --> 00:07:48,221
Yes, you did! Denise, we’re sleeping together, and you’re engaged.
Stop yelling at me!

136
00:07:48,322 --> 00:07:52,022
Don’t think that I deserve some―
It just happened.
Oh, it just happened. You just happened to get engaged.

137
00:07:52,023 --> 00:07:53,223
Y―yeah. You know what? Get out!

138
00:07:53,324 --> 00:07:57,224
So this is the modern woman. She has her friends with benefits and collects her marriage proposals on the side!

139
00:07:57,225 --> 00:07:59,025
Get out!
You really have it all, don’t you?

140
00:07:59,026 --> 00:08:00,626
Yeah, yeah. I really have it all.

141
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:04,227
I’m in love with a man who is dying.
Lucky, lucky me!

142
00:08:07,428 --> 00:08:08,628
Son of a bitch.

143
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:19,929
Why didn’t you just tell me that you’re seeing him?

144
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:26,530
Because he was in Switzerland getting an experimental treatment and I didn’t think he was coming back.

145
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:33,031
I am sorry that I love him.

146
00:08:34,032 --> 00:08:38,732
I don’t want to love him, but I do.

147
00:08:47,733 --> 00:08:50,733
I’ve gotta get him help. My God, if you saw the way he hugged her . . .

148
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:52,134
Is she cute?

149
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:54,035
Denny, it’s a doll.

150
00:08:54,136 --> 00:08:57,036
Aw, c’mon. Don’t tell me you’ve never gone to town on a doll.

151
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,437
No-o-o-o, as a matter of fact.

152
00:09:02,838 --> 00:09:03,438
Have you?

153
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:07,539
Denny . . .

154
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,440
Well, not just any doll. I―I―I’m not . . .

155
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:12,341
what’s the word . . .

156
00:09:12,442 --> 00:09:16,842
Peculiar?
But I suppose I’ve been with . . . special doll . . .

157
00:09:19,843 --> 00:09:20,843
Would I like her?

158
00:09:22,844 --> 00:09:23,944
Do you wanna meet her?

159
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:26,745
She’s in the closet.

160
00:09:27,146 --> 00:09:28,746
Denny, I’ve been in that closet.
Not this closet.

161
00:09:29,747 --> 00:09:32,047
I’m the only one with the key to this closet.

162
00:09:45,048 --> 00:09:48,248
Alan Shore, meet Shirley Schmidt-Ho.

163
00:09:49,349 --> 00:09:49,949
Oh, my God.!

164
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,650
This little “ho” knows how to please, let me tell ya!

165
00:09:53,651 --> 00:09:55,651
You had this custom-made.

166
00:09:55,652 --> 00:09:58,652
Here’s the thing about rich people, Alan.

167
00:09:58,653 --> 00:10:01,053
We get whatever we want.

168
00:10:02,154 --> 00:10:04,354
Shirley Schmidt-Ho.

169
00:10:12,255 --> 00:10:14,655
All rise. Judge Clark Brown presiding.

170
00:10:15,956 --> 00:10:16,756
Oh, dear.

171
00:10:17,395 --> 00:10:19,857
Problem?
Judge Brown―I’m not his favorite.

172
00:10:20,058 --> 00:10:20,958
Be seated.

173
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:32,359
Ms Schmidt, I have before me your
motion to dismiss on constitutional grounds.

174
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,160
Denied.

175
00:10:35,661 --> 00:10:37,061
You’d better take this.

176
00:10:39,462 --> 00:10:43,062
Your Honor, I would ask that you would reconsider the defense’s motion.

177
00:10:43,063 --> 00:10:44,063
I will not.

178
00:10:44,864 --> 00:10:48,664
He wanted to purchase a lung, and he wanted to sell a lung.

179
00:10:48,665 --> 00:10:52,165
Horrible; horrible! And shocking!

180
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:55,566
I―in the interest of fairness, your Honor, it’s imperative that . . .

181
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:57,667
No. I’m ruling on your papers.

182
00:10:57,668 --> 00:11:03,168
The law, as it stands, is constitutional. And my decision stands firm.

183
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:06,569
I am not one of your activist judges, Ms. Bauer.

184
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:13,070
I follow the law as it is written―
a practice that makes me neither “nansy” nor “pansy.”

185
00:11:13,971 --> 00:11:15,271
We will proceed.

186
00:11:15,972 --> 00:11:18,372
I spoke with a few psychologists,

187
00:11:18,573 --> 00:11:22,173
and while they can appreciate how a person with Asperger’s

188
00:11:22,674 --> 00:11:26,774
might find comfort in an imaginary soulmate . . .

189
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,375
You’re choosing your words carefully.

190
00:11:28,376 --> 00:11:30,276
Why are you talking this way?

191
00:11:30,277 --> 00:11:33,177
When you talk to me like that, I do not hear your words.

192
00:11:33,178 --> 00:11:38,278
I only hear the pitter-patter of somebody
tiptoeing lightly around a crazy person.

193
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:45,979
I know she’s not real. I’m not delusional. I just . . .
I spent a lot of money on it―that’s all.

194
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,680
Jerry, that isn’t truthful.

195
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:54,881
You may not be having sex with it,
but you’ve completely individualized it.

196
00:11:54,882 --> 00:12:00,582
You call it her, you treat her as a loved one―
You’ve just described every man’s relationship with his car.

197
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:09,983
The psychologists tell me, as understandable as your
attraction may be, it isn’t healthy.

198
00:12:11,284 --> 00:12:13,884
Have you ever been with a real woman, sexually?

199
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,885
I think you know the answer to that question, Alan.

200
00:12:20,686 --> 00:12:30,086
There was a time, years ago, when I had some difficulty of a certain stripe.

201
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:33,987
I was referred to a sex therapist, a surrogate, in fact.

202
00:12:33,988 --> 00:12:34,988
I’d like you to meet with her.

203
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:39,989
That’s disgusting!
It is not disgusting. What’s more, she helped me enormously.

204
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,190
I believe she could help you.

205
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:49,991
For God’s sake, Jerry, you’re smart enough to realize your disability with intimacy is profound here.

206
00:12:49,992 --> 00:12:52,192
You need to get help.

207
00:12:54,293 --> 00:12:55,993
I was accepted to Penn this spring.

208
00:12:56,694 --> 00:13:00,394
I knew it was out of our price range, so I contacted the
financial aid office.

209
00:13:00,395 --> 00:13:02,295
Did you qualify for financial assistance?

210
00:13:02,296 --> 00:13:04,996
I didn’t need to. My tuition was paid―

211
00:13:05,397 --> 00:13:06,997
all four years, in full.

212
00:13:06,998 --> 00:13:08,298
Who paid your tuition, Megan?

213
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:11,599
It took some digging, but I eventually learned that it was Daniel Post.

214
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,600
I asked my father who Daniel Post was, and if he knew anything about it.

215
00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:21,001
He said I should be grateful and keep it between us.
Then I found the test.

216
00:13:21,602 --> 00:13:22,902
Commonwealth Exhibit A.

217
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,303
Was this the test you discovered?

218
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,604
Yes, in my dad’s desk.

219
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:30,005
It’s the comparison study between my father and Mr. Post.

220
00:13:30,006 --> 00:13:32,306
They’re a
perfect match for each other.

221
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:36,207
Megan, why are you here, testifying against your father?

222
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,908
My mother died when I was six.

223
00:13:41,309 --> 00:13:44,909
My dad . . . is my whole family.

224
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,910
You have to at least try.

225
00:13:51,111 --> 00:13:55,911
Megan, it’s clear that you love your father very, very much.

226
00:13:56,112 --> 00:13:59,912
And he has a tumor in his brain that cannot be removed.

227
00:14:00,113 --> 00:14:02,213
And there’s no getting around that, is there?

228
00:14:04,014 --> 00:14:11,114
No.
But, there’s no real evidence that Daniel Post paid your tuition
in exchange for one of your fathers lungs.

229
00:14:11,315 --> 00:14:15,115
There’s no contract between them, nothing signed, no receipt.

230
00:14:15,116 --> 00:14:19,716
There’s no real proof of a connection between the two of them, correct?

231
00:14:20,017 --> 00:14:22,717
So, they just got typed and matched for the hell of it?

232
00:14:24,118 --> 00:14:28,318
Megan . . . your father still has both of his lungs.

233
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:35,019
Isn’t it possible that Daniel Post paid your tuition to be nice?

234
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,220
Because he could―for the daughter of a friend.

235
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,721
Joanna. My name is Alan Shore. I’m not sure if you remember me.

236
00:15:01,022 --> 00:15:03,722
Yes! How are you, Alan?

237
00:15:03,723 --> 00:15:06,423
I have a . . . a matter of great urgency.

238
00:15:06,424 --> 00:15:07,924
I wonder if I could speak with you.

239
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:12,825
And I’m just afraid the more isolated he becomes,

240
00:15:13,426 --> 00:15:17,426
I mean, I would imagine men who bond with dolls―

241
00:15:18,227 --> 00:15:20,927
some kind of intervention has to take place here.

242
00:15:21,928 --> 00:15:23,528
Alan, I’m retired.

243
00:15:23,729 --> 00:15:29,229
I’ve remarried, and my husband
has problems with his wife being a sexual surrogate.

244
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,130
You’ve retired?

245
00:15:30,131 --> 00:15:37,431
But I can refer you to several other . . . therapists.
Without even meeting these women, I know they simply cannot be you.

246
00:15:37,432 --> 00:15:39,532
Well, I suppose I’m flattered.

247
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:41,833
I mean to connote despair, not flattery.

248
00:15:42,434 --> 00:15:48,134
My friend is extremely disenfranchised, both sexually and emotionally,

249
00:15:48,135 --> 00:15:51,535
and time is running out.
He’s in his 40s; his best friend is a doll.

250
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:57,536
Could you please come out of
retirement for just one case? I beg you.

251
00:16:02,637 --> 00:16:06,837
I don’t wanna be alone with her. Can’t I do this . . .
over the computer?

252
00:16:06,838 --> 00:16:09,238
No, Jerry. You have to be in the same room.

253
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:12,339
I’m not comfortable. I don’t want to be alone with her.

254
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:16,440
And don’t go rushing off to court, trying to get
some sort of order. You can’t make me, Alan!

255
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:19,741
Would it help if Patty went with you?

256
00:16:19,742 --> 00:16:22,442
That’ll just make me look more like a freak!

257
00:16:22,443 --> 00:16:25,743
No, it won’t. How ‘bout we both join you, Patty and I,

258
00:16:25,744 --> 00:16:27,944
just for the . . . initial consultation?

259
00:16:29,645 --> 00:16:32,145
Eleven-thirty sounds just perfect. Thank you, Joanna.

260
00:16:32,646 --> 00:16:35,946
You have no idea how grateful I am. See you then.

261
00:16:37,147 --> 00:16:39,247
You missed your ten o’clock.

262
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,148
Um, something came up.

263
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:44,449
Something was supposed to come up in the closet at ten o’clock.

264
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:49,450
I’ve got a few minutes now if you’d like to go somewhere and grab a bite?

265
00:16:50,851 --> 00:16:51,851
I’m leaving for New York.

266
00:16:53,252 --> 00:16:53,852
Now?

267
00:16:53,953 --> 00:16:56,353
Friday. I’m transferring to the New York office.

268
00:16:56,454 --> 00:17:00,554
What? Why?
I don’t feel I’m doing my best work here.

269
00:17:00,555 --> 00:17:02,055
I assure you, Marlene, you are.

270
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:04,356
I’ll miss you.

271
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:07,757
Heh! That’s it? You’ll miss me?

272
00:17:10,358 --> 00:17:11,758
Dear.

273
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,759
Mr. Post, who is Eugene Volukh?

274
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,260
Eugene is a security guard at my office building.

275
00:17:19,261 --> 00:17:21,361
Why did you write him a check for $50,000?

276
00:17:22,562 --> 00:17:25,762
Eugene’s son is autistic. He has to go to a special school.

277
00:17:25,763 --> 00:17:27,863
So you just . . . gave him the money?

278
00:17:29,664 --> 00:17:37,664
So, in addition to Katrina relief, the Children’s Hospital of Boston and a dozen other charities, you just give money to people that you meet?

279
00:17:40,465 --> 00:17:45,465
Have you ever asked any of the people
that you’ve helped for something in return?

280
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:50,666
No.
Not even say, um . . . a body part?

281
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:52,667
Not a one.

282
00:17:53,068 --> 00:17:56,168
Ah, Mr. Post, how’d you get to court this morning?
Car.

283
00:17:56,169 --> 00:17:58,369
You drove?
I was driven.

284
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,370
You have a car and driver.

285
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:01,271
Let’s just stick to that I’m a rich guy, all right?

286
00:18:01,272 --> 00:18:03,572
Rich guys play by different rules, don’t they?

287
00:18:03,573 --> 00:18:07,173
The same rules, just I have more toys. You did hear I share money, right?

288
00:18:07,174 --> 00:18:10,874
I did. You’re obviously a generous man, and a lucky one.

289
00:18:11,475 --> 00:18:12,775
Except for the whole cancer thing.

290
00:18:12,776 --> 00:18:15,476
Well, but you got the best treatment money could buy, right?

291
00:18:15,477 --> 00:18:18,777
And then you got yourself
into the most promising drug trial in this country, right?

292
00:18:18,778 --> 00:18:20,278
Along with about 2000 other people.

293
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:22,979
You were sued for manipulating that study to your benefit.

294
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,880
Ah, suit went away.

295
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:31,681
Because the plaintiff died, but not before you tried to buy your way out of the inconvenience of a trial.

296
00:18:31,682 --> 00:18:36,282
And when the study here at home didn’t work, you just got yourself into another one in Switzerland, didn’t you?

297
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:38,883
A man like you used to controlling everything in your world, you’d do anything . . .

298
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,584
Objection!
And sustained.

299
00:18:40,585 --> 00:18:44,885
I’m just saying, Mr. Post, you’ve got deep pockets. You’re able to use them to get what you want.

300
00:18:45,786 --> 00:18:49,686
And the one lung that you have left―it’s not going to last forever, is it?

301
00:18:49,987 --> 00:18:53,587
Every time you have to stop
on the street, you feel that tightness in your chest,

302
00:18:53,588 --> 00:18:55,788
it reminds you of how vulnerable you are, doesn’t it?
Objection!

303
00:18:56,589 --> 00:19:00,189
Your Honor, this trial shouldn’t be about who offered what to whom.

304
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:04,090
It should be about whether or not our government has the right to control

305
00:19:04,191 --> 00:19:07,791
what we can and cannot do with our own bodies.

306
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:11,792
What you should be able to do to save your own life!

307
00:19:11,793 --> 00:19:13,493
Your Honor!
Disregard that view . . .

308
00:19:13,494 --> 00:19:16,394
Judge Brown doesn’t want to hear about these issues because the cut a little bit too close to the bone.

309
00:19:16,395 --> 00:19:21,495
You see, I did some research and it seems Judge Brown is himself a survivor of colon cancer.

310
00:19:22,696 --> 00:19:23,996
But his is treatable.

311
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,697
He can throw a couple radioactive seeds in the back door,

312
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:30,998
and then you don’t have to face the hard truth about what you would be willing to do

313
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:33,999
if you were dying.

314
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,300
You know, Jerry, Alan is very concerned about you.

315
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:52,401
He thinks your social isolation is rather extreme.

316
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:58,402
But the good news is: It’s not.

317
00:19:59,203 --> 00:20:02,803
Many men your age are living alone these days without partners.

318
00:20:03,504 --> 00:20:05,604
It’s become all too common, in fact.

319
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:08,805
And I’ve treated many like you who prefer dolls.

320
00:20:10,306 --> 00:20:13,806
Mainly, they’re motivated by a desire to avoid rejection,

321
00:20:14,807 --> 00:20:20,307
which, when you think about it, every man fears rejection from women on some level.

322
00:20:24,008 --> 00:20:24,508
Thank you.

323
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:34,509
Do you lie in your bed next to Patricia?

324
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,310
I do not have sex with her.

325
00:20:36,311 --> 00:20:37,211
Oh, I believe you.

326
00:20:37,812 --> 00:20:42,212
I believe you, because what you’re looking for isn’t sex so much as . . .

327
00:20:43,113 --> 00:20:45,113
intimacy in a relationship.

328
00:20:49,714 --> 00:20:53,414
Jerry, I wanna have another session, when you and I just lie together.

329
00:20:55,215 --> 00:20:59,515
No sexual touching; we just lie next to each other.

330
00:20:59,516 --> 00:21:01,916
Oh, I don’t know.
Oh, It won’t be about sex,

331
00:21:02,817 --> 00:21:07,017
but body awareness, and relaxation.

332
00:21:09,818 --> 00:21:10,818
Naked?

333
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:11,819
Yes.

334
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,620
I wouldn’t want you there for that.

335
00:21:21,021 --> 00:21:21,621
Understood.

336
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:32,122
That didn’t go very well.

337
00:21:33,723 --> 00:21:34,723
No, it didn’t.

338
00:21:40,024 --> 00:21:42,424
Are you okay?
I’m . . . fine.

339
00:21:44,925 --> 00:21:46,525
A penny for your thoughts?

340
00:21:46,526 --> 00:21:49,826
My thoughts are not for sale, unlike the rest of . . .

341
00:21:53,127 --> 00:21:54,327
Ouch.

342
00:21:54,328 --> 00:21:55,328
Uh.

343
00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:03,929
My father didn’t have a lot to leave when he died.

344
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:09,030
He actually executed something called "an ethical will.”
Have you ever heard of them?

345
00:22:09,031 --> 00:22:10,031
I’ve drafted them.

346
00:22:11,432 --> 00:22:15,632
He believed that a person’s final legacy shouldn’t be so much about his money

347
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:20,133
as about his character, his values.

348
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:26,133
Sometimes I wonder what Daniel’s legacy is going to be.

349
00:22:27,534 --> 00:22:28,434
Why don’t you ask him?

350
00:22:30,335 --> 00:22:33,335
He’d say that legacies are for dead people and he doesn’t want to be dead.

351
00:22:34,136 --> 00:22:36,336
I guess that’s the only answer he can live with.

352
00:22:37,337 --> 00:22:40,037
The question is: Can you?

353
00:23:04,838 --> 00:23:05,538
How you feeling?

354
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:08,939
Fine, thank you.

355
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:19,140
Before I get into bed, I’d like to take off my robe and I just want you to look at me.

356
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:22,141
Do you think you can do that?

357
00:23:23,042 --> 00:23:23,642
I’ll try.

358
00:23:36,143 --> 00:23:37,843
Could you look at me, Jerry?

359
00:23:44,144 --> 00:23:47,644
See? There’s nothing terribly foreign about the female body, Jerry.

360
00:23:51,145 --> 00:23:53,645
I’m going to climb in with you now, okay?

361
00:23:57,746 --> 00:23:58,246
Okay.

362
00:24:11,747 --> 00:24:12,547
How you feeling?

363
00:24:12,648 --> 00:24:13,848
I’m afraid.

364
00:24:15,949 --> 00:24:17,449
Would you like me to hold you?

365
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,450
Ohh.

366
00:24:24,051 --> 00:24:25,451
Okay.

367
00:24:34,452 --> 00:24:38,752
Oh,

368
00:24:39,453 --> 00:24:40,753
gosh.

369
00:24:44,653 --> 00:24:45,453
Freeze!

370
00:24:45,454 --> 00:24:47,054
No, no, no! You can’t be in here!

371
00:24:53,855 --> 00:24:55,255
Just one moment, please!

372
00:24:56,356 --> 00:24:57,456
God, no!

373
00:25:03,657 --> 00:25:07,357
I am looking for him.
As soon as I find him, I will get him down to the station.

374
00:25:07,358 --> 00:25:11,558
I―ahh―I hear
you, Jerry.

375
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:15,059
Alan!

376
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,460
Oww, come on!

377
00:25:23,361 --> 00:25:24,061
Alan!

378
00:25:27,562 --> 00:25:28,762
What?!

379
00:25:34,363 --> 00:25:36,863
You can’t blame Daniel Post for wanting to live.

380
00:25:38,264 --> 00:25:40,264
What’s the harm, he asked?

381
00:25:40,265 --> 00:25:44,165
We have many individual liberties that are dearly cherished in this country.

382
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:48,366
Equally cherished is the notion that our lawmaking bodies seek to protect the public good.

383
00:25:49,067 --> 00:25:52,967
As a result, we don’t have carte blanche to do whatever we please with our bodies.

384
00:25:53,568 --> 00:25:56,268
Well, Daniel Post decided that he was above the law.

385
00:25:57,169 --> 00:26:00,969
He figures he doesn’t have to play by the same rules that apply to you and me.

386
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,970
So where’s the harm?

387
00:26:04,171 --> 00:26:07,671
And it’s not just a matter of anarchy or the sanctity of the law.

388
00:26:07,672 --> 00:26:12,572
Hundreds of thousands of people donate their organs every year so that others might live.

389
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:15,773
And they count on the system of distribution to be fair.

390
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:19,174
If it’s not, those organ donations could stop,

391
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:22,775
or, most certainly, decline, and people die.

392
00:26:23,876 --> 00:26:26,676
That’s a harm he doesn’t care about.

393
00:26:27,577 --> 00:26:30,577
I’m hoping the twelve of you do.

394
00:26:32,578 --> 00:26:34,378
I have a nephew; he’s in college.

395
00:26:34,879 --> 00:26:41,079
During his semester break, he offered himself as a subject
for medical research in exchange for money.

396
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,380
This is legal.

397
00:26:43,281 --> 00:26:46,481
The woman who lives down the block from me had
her eggs harvested

398
00:26:46,482 --> 00:26:49,182
so that another woman could have a baby.

399
00:26:49,283 --> 00:26:51,083
She did this in exchange for money.

400
00:26:51,084 --> 00:26:52,084
This is legal.

401
00:26:52,685 --> 00:26:57,885
People can sell their hair, their blood, their sperm.
Legal.

402
00:26:58,986 --> 00:27:02,186
Our nation already embraces the notion that

403
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:10,387
we have the right to sell parts of ourselves,
that we are free to make these kinds of decisions about our own bodies.

404
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:13,788
Well, sort of.
Certain parts, we have no rights.

405
00:27:14,389 --> 00:27:18,689
But the truth is, organ sales are happening anyway.

406
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,090
Would―would you like a kidney?

407
00:27:21,491 --> 00:27:26,791
I can get you one in Brazil for as low as $3000,
in the Philippines for eighteen hundred.

408
00:27:27,192 --> 00:27:33,192
I can get you an Achilles tendon in South Korea for anywhere between two- and twelve-hundred dollars.

409
00:27:34,393 --> 00:27:35,993
Why does this black market exist?

410
00:27:36,794 --> 00:27:41,894
Because our current system of organ donation is woefully failing us.

411
00:27:42,295 --> 00:27:44,895
Sure, you can put your name on a list,

412
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:49,196
along with 92 thousand people who are left on the list each year.

413
00:27:49,197 --> 00:27:53,397
In the meantime, anyone who can circumvent that list is doing so.

414
00:27:53,398 --> 00:27:55,898
Families and friends donate directly.

415
00:27:55,899 --> 00:27:59,499
Police and firefighters have an informal network

416
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,900
where they donate their organs to each other.

417
00:28:03,301 --> 00:28:10,201
And―and for a stiff monthly fee,
any patient can subscribe to a donor-matching website.

418
00:28:11,402 --> 00:28:13,802
And Daniel Post found Tom Ralston.

419
00:28:15,403 --> 00:28:22,003
Washington DC Circuit Court previously found
we have a constitutional right to save ourselves.

420
00:28:24,504 --> 00:28:26,304
That’s all Daniel Post was trying to do.

421
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:53,405
Jerry, I am so, so sorry.

422
00:28:53,406 --> 00:28:55,706
I feel completely responsible and I will make this go away.

423
00:28:55,707 --> 00:28:57,007
I give you my absolute word.

424
00:28:57,108 --> 00:28:58,008
What happened?

425
00:28:58,409 --> 00:29:04,509
It seems the awful Mr. Ginsberg, our politically-ambitious zealot of a prosecutor,

426
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:07,710
has begun a citywide
crack-down on a broad assortment of

427
00:29:07,711 --> 00:29:11,211
what he considers immoral sexual activity, and, somehow,

428
00:29:11,212 --> 00:29:13,512
you and Joanna got caught up in it,

429
00:29:13,513 --> 00:29:15,913
but I promise you, Jerry, this will not stand.

430
00:29:16,414 --> 00:29:19,614
It’s prostitution, pure and simple.
Not prostitution―

431
00:29:19,615 --> 00:29:20,615
it was treatment.

432
00:29:20,616 --> 00:29:24,316
What’s more, they didn’t even engage in any sexual activity.

433
00:29:24,317 --> 00:29:25,317
Because they didn’t have time.

434
00:29:25,318 --> 00:29:27,018
You bumptious moron!

435
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:32,919
Your Honor, the depravity of this society when it comes to sex has become epidemic.

436
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,320
Somebody has to be a guardian of decency and―

437
00:29:36,321 --> 00:29:44,021
This depraved society for which you have anointed yourself decency guardian
spends billions of dollars on sexual dysfunction.

438
00:29:44,022 --> 00:29:49,322
You can’t turn on a cartoon today without seeing an ad for erectile dysfunction!

439
00:29:49,423 --> 00:29:51,823
It’s one of the fastest growing industries in our country.

440
00:29:51,824 --> 00:29:54,024
Better sex through chemicals.

441
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:55,725
I’m not sure I see your point.

442
00:29:55,826 --> 00:29:56,726
My point is:

443
00:29:56,727 --> 00:30:00,027
We’re cultivating an obsession with sexual performance.

444
00:30:00,028 --> 00:30:02,328
And, while it’s perfectly
acceptable to take a pill,

445
00:30:02,329 --> 00:30:04,929
if you seek behavioral therapy, well,

446
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:08,230
that just goes against everything
we stand for as a pharmaceutical nation.

447
00:30:08,231 --> 00:30:10,631
Well, this man has Asperger’s syndrome.

448
00:30:10,732 --> 00:30:13,432
He has a disability when it comes to establishing

449
00:30:13,433 --> 00:30:17,933
intimate social, emotional, and, yes, sexual relationships.

450
00:30:17,934 --> 00:30:19,034
He sought treatment.

451
00:30:19,335 --> 00:30:23,135
And this pompous buffoon wants to make a case out of it

452
00:30:23,236 --> 00:30:25,336
to get some face-time with Nancy Grace.

453
00:30:25,337 --> 00:30:27,337
I move for an immediate motion to dismiss,

454
00:30:27,338 --> 00:30:30,538
I move for costs and I ask your Honor to sentence this idiot

455
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:33,039
to sensitivity training, preferably for life.

456
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,840
All right. I’m going to take this under advisement.

457
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:39,841
And I will rule quickly. Adjourned.

458
00:30:41,342 --> 00:30:43,842
I am very, very sorry.

459
00:30:46,943 --> 00:30:49,843
I feel so awful. I ended up hurting them both.

460
00:30:49,844 --> 00:30:54,044
It’ll probably make the news, compounding their embarrassment.
Alan, face it. You screwed up.

461
00:30:54,045 --> 00:30:58,545
So all you can do is apologize, accept responsibility, and check yourself into rehab.

462
00:31:01,846 --> 00:31:02,546
What?

463
00:31:03,747 --> 00:31:04,647
She’s gone.

464
00:31:04,848 --> 00:31:05,648
Who?

465
00:31:06,149 --> 00:31:08,649
Marlene. She left . . . the firm.

466
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:11,950
No, no. She went to the New York office. She’ll be back.

467
00:31:13,051 --> 00:31:14,151
This girl mean something to you?

468
00:31:14,252 --> 00:31:15,352
Don’t be silly.

469
00:31:17,153 --> 00:31:17,953
Denny!

470
00:31:19,154 --> 00:31:24,154
There’s a rather monstrous rumor going around that you customized a doll in my likeness.

471
00:31:24,155 --> 00:31:28,055
A doll you were caught having sex with in closet.

472
00:31:29,656 --> 00:31:30,556
That was him.

473
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:34,257
I assure you, I’m holding out for the real thing.

474
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:37,258
Did you have a doll made in my likeness, Denny?

475
00:31:38,459 --> 00:31:40,259
Come on, Shirley; you should be flattered.

476
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,960
To be a sexual prop―that’s every woman’s dream.

477
00:31:44,061 --> 00:31:44,761
Isn’t it?

478
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:45,762
What’s her name?

479
00:31:47,163 --> 00:31:47,663
Sorry?

480
00:31:47,664 --> 00:31:49,264
I’m told she has a name. What is it?

481
00:31:50,665 --> 00:31:53,865
Oh, that. Why that’s . . . uh . . .

482
00:31:54,066 --> 00:31:55,566
Shirley Schmidt-Ho.

483
00:32:00,067 --> 00:32:00,467
I’d like to meet her.

484
00:32:02,068 --> 00:32:04,568
Well, I’d don’t think that’s very . . .
You will bring me the doll.

485
00:32:12,069 --> 00:32:13,669
This won’t be good.
No.

486
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,270
It’s a fluke that you’re both wearing the same outfit.

487
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:21,471
I know how you women don’t like to see yourselves.

488
00:32:23,172 --> 00:32:27,272
Denny, can you not appreciate how this degrades me?

489
00:32:28,173 --> 00:32:31,173
Well, uh, uh, uh, I’m just objectifying you―

490
00:32:31,174 --> 00:32:32,574
for pleasure.

491
00:32:33,575 --> 00:32:37,275
You truly can’t see how this might humiliate me?

492
00:32:40,976 --> 00:32:42,476
You’re jealous?

493
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:49,177
Here’s my problem.

494
00:32:49,778 --> 00:32:52,678
There’s no licensing or regulation of surrogate partners.

495
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:57,579
As Mr. Ginsberg notes, 
I suppose any prostitute could claim she’s a surrogate.

496
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:02,880
But, Ms. Miller was at one time a member of 
the International Professional Surrogate Association,

497
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:07,181
and that is a legitimate and often effective
treatment.

498
00:33:07,182 --> 00:33:08,282
Oh, please.

499
00:33:08,283 --> 00:33:11,583
I’m also mindful of the hypocrisy Mr. Shore eluded to earlier.

500
00:33:11,584 --> 00:33:14,584
Big pharmaceutical spends billions of dollars

501
00:33:14,585 --> 00:33:17,585
cultivating a national obsession with sexual performance.

502
00:33:17,586 --> 00:33:21,486
We’re okay with pushing pills, 
but we condemn behavioral treatment?

503
00:33:25,787 --> 00:33:29,587
The charges against Mr. Espenson and Ms. Miller are dismissed.

504
00:33:31,788 --> 00:33:34,188
Mr. Ginsberg, I’m sure, if you look hard,

505
00:33:34,589 --> 00:33:37,189
you’ll be able to find something better to do with your time.

506
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,190
Adjourned.

507
00:33:39,691 --> 00:33:42,591
Thank you, thank you!
Thank you, thank you!

508
00:33:42,692 --> 00:33:47,592
Jerry, you heard what judge said about the treatment being very effective.

509
00:33:47,893 --> 00:33:49,593
I hope you’ll see Joanna again.

510
00:33:50,994 --> 00:33:52,794
Can I think about it?
Of course.

511
00:33:52,795 --> 00:33:53,795
Okay.

512
00:33:55,396 --> 00:33:56,796
Thank you again, Alan.

513
00:33:59,297 --> 00:34:00,197
My friend.

514
00:34:04,498 --> 00:34:05,198
Thank you.

515
00:34:18,299 --> 00:34:19,499
What’s wrong?

516
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,400
Sorry?

517
00:34:22,301 --> 00:34:23,301
You’re blue.

518
00:34:24,402 --> 00:34:27,702
Me? I’m not, actually.

519
00:34:28,103 --> 00:34:30,303
We got the desired result here.

520
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:36,604
I’m still concerned about any embarrassment
I might have caused you or Jerry.

521
00:34:38,805 --> 00:34:41,205
But I wouldn’t describe myself as . . .
Blue?

522
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:42,806
Ah, ah―

523
00:34:46,907 --> 00:34:47,907
yep.

524
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:51,108
There was a girl. She left.

525
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:58,509
It’s not as if we had any kind of meaningful relationship,

526
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,310
but I suppose when I was with her,

527
00:35:00,311 --> 00:35:04,411
I could be my true, unadulterated self, which is, as you know . . .

528
00:35:04,412 --> 00:35:05,612
Degenerate.

529
00:35:10,613 --> 00:35:14,813
These past few years, I’ve felt this inexplicable compulsion to be somewhat redeeming,

530
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:19,814
as if I were some series regular on a television show.

531
00:35:23,215 --> 00:35:25,715
Something about Marlene allowed me to be―

532
00:35:27,016 --> 00:35:28,616
Degenerate.

533
00:35:33,217 --> 00:35:37,017
In addition to your treatment of Jerry,

534
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:40,718
do you think you could maybe squeeze me in?

535
00:35:48,219 --> 00:35:50,619
How about we measure you for some trousers?

536
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,320
The defendant will please rise.

537
00:36:00,321 --> 00:36:03,921
Madam Foreperson? The jury has reached a unanimous verdict?

538
00:36:03,922 --> 00:36:05,722
We have.
What say you?

539
00:36:05,723 --> 00:36:08,223
In the matter of the Commonwealth vs Daniel Post,

540
00:36:08,224 --> 00:36:11,324
on the charge of violating the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act,

541
00:36:11,725 --> 00:36:13,025
we find the defendant . . .

542
00:36:14,526 --> 00:36:15,626
not guilty.

543
00:36:17,127 --> 00:36:18,227
Wow.

544
00:36:29,328 --> 00:36:31,128
Are you going to talk to me at all?

545
00:36:34,129 --> 00:36:37,229
Do you still love me? Because I still love you.

546
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,130
All right. Tell you what.

547
00:36:41,131 --> 00:36:44,931
You know that―that―that new fur coat in the window of Bergdorf-Goodman’s?
Um, hmm.

548
00:36:45,732 --> 00:36:46,932
I’ll buy you Bergdorf-Goodman’s.

549
00:36:51,133 --> 00:36:53,233
Daniel.

550
00:36:54,534 --> 00:36:57,134
I think I fell in love with most of you.

551
00:36:58,035 --> 00:36:58,935
Well, I can live with that.

552
00:36:58,936 --> 00:37:02,336
It’s just the rest of the stuff. I, uh,

553
00:37:02,237 --> 00:37:03,537
I need some time.

554
00:37:03,738 --> 00:37:05,638
Well, you know that―that works out, too, because, uh,

555
00:37:07,539 --> 00:37:09,839
Tom and I are going to be going on a little vacation.

556
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,440
How long?

557
00:37:13,241 --> 00:37:14,341
Five, six weeks.

558
00:37:17,442 --> 00:37:18,542
Uh, where?

559
00:37:20,543 --> 00:37:21,743
Probably best you don’t know.

560
00:37:28,344 --> 00:37:29,444
Right.

561
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:27,045
What do you mean, she’s measuring you for trousers?

562
00:38:28,146 --> 00:38:29,846
Is that some kind of fetish?

563
00:38:30,747 --> 00:38:31,847
Would I like it?

564
00:38:35,048 --> 00:38:39,748
My mother wasn’t a particularly doting woman, Denny.

565
00:38:40,749 --> 00:38:43,549
She never held me much or . . .

566
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:49,250
except every fall before the school year began,

567
00:38:49,251 --> 00:38:55,251
she’d prepare my school clothes, measure me for my pants―

568
00:38:56,152 --> 00:38:58,452
the hems and so forth.

569
00:39:00,153 --> 00:39:05,353
I’d stand there; her hand would be on my leg, my seam.

570
00:39:07,254 --> 00:39:08,854
You had a thing for your mother.

571
00:39:11,855 --> 00:39:13,855
It wasn’t sexual.

572
00:39:15,956 --> 00:39:17,856
Her touch was just―

573
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:20,857
mm, I guess-

574
00:39:21,658 --> 00:39:22,658
loving.

575
00:39:24,459 --> 00:39:27,259
One of the reasons I buy so many suits, I think.

576
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,460
While the tailors . . . 

577
00:39:31,461 --> 00:39:33,461
do what they do.

578
00:39:33,462 --> 00:39:40,662
I suppose it reminds me of the times in my childhood 
I allowed myself to feel cared for.

579
00:39:44,463 --> 00:39:45,363
Now,

580
00:39:46,164 --> 00:39:47,164
Joanna,

581
00:39:48,565 --> 00:39:50,265
the way she would touch me,

582
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:56,066
running her fingers up the inseam, around in the back, here and there,

583
00:39:58,367 --> 00:40:00,667
it did become erotic.

584
00:40:03,268 --> 00:40:05,068
Getting measured for pants.

585
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:09,769
It’s not entirely about sex, Denny;

586
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:10,870
it’s about

587
00:40:12,071 --> 00:40:14,671
being touched in

588
00:40:17,172 --> 00:40:18,772
gentle,

589
00:40:19,673 --> 00:40:21,273
intimate ways.

590
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:32,174
I suppose I’m starved for a little tenderness sometimes.

591
00:40:36,275 --> 00:40:37,875
Never taking you fishing again.

592
00:40:48,576 --> 00:40:50,076
You ever get lonely, Denny?

593
00:40:53,177 --> 00:40:54,977
What’s with all this deep thinking?

594
00:40:56,778 --> 00:40:59,878
It’s a simple question. Do you ever get lonely?

595
00:41:02,479 --> 00:41:03,879
Do you?

596
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,580
No.

597
00:41:14,281 --> 00:41:15,681
You?

598
00:41:21,782 --> 00:41:22,782
No.

599
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:28,183
Guess we’re both lucky that way.

600
