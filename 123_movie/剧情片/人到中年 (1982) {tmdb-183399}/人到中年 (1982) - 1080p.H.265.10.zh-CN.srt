161
00:05:49,878 --> 00:05:51,912
Well, worst-case scenario --
the county could demand

162
00:05:51,947 --> 00:05:53,714
that you tear down
any work that was done

163
00:05:53,748 --> 00:05:55,449
and rebuild
with the proper permits.

164
00:05:55,483 --> 00:05:56,550
All of it?

165
00:05:56,584 --> 00:05:57,985
No, no --
just the new construction.

166
00:05:58,019 --> 00:05:59,386
No, that's all of it.

167
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,654
Oh.

168
00:06:00,688 --> 00:06:02,756
Uh... then yes.

169
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:09,158
Thank you.

170
00:06:09,193 --> 00:06:10,993
Have a good day.

171
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:15,562
Hey, Maria.
Hey.

172
00:06:15,597 --> 00:06:17,030
Oh.

173
00:06:17,065 --> 00:06:19,899
We need, um,
more... miller.

174
00:06:19,934 --> 00:06:20,867
miller?

175
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:22,802
You know,
the silver balloons.

176
00:06:22,836 --> 00:06:25,037
Oh, mylar.
It's pronounced "my-lar."

177
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:26,571
We're out of it.

178
00:06:26,606 --> 00:06:28,239
All right.

179
00:06:31,276 --> 00:06:33,544
Hey, Maria...

180
00:06:33,578 --> 00:06:34,845
You and, um...

181
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,479
you and -- and --
what's-her-name,

182
00:06:36,513 --> 00:06:38,414
you guys --
you broke up, right?

183
00:06:38,448 --> 00:06:39,481
Kaitlyn.

184
00:06:39,515 --> 00:06:40,582
Yeah.

185
00:06:40,616 --> 00:06:42,484
I'm just -- the only reason
I'm bringing it up

186
00:06:42,518 --> 00:06:44,720
is 'cause my daughter, Lucy,
just broke up with this kid,

187
00:06:44,755 --> 00:06:47,191
and he's taking it
kind of hard, you know,

188
00:06:47,225 --> 00:06:48,292
and -- I don't know.

189
00:06:48,326 --> 00:06:52,795
Did -- did Kaitlyn
ever get... clingy?

190
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,797
She ever, like,
couldn't let go?

191
00:06:56,798 --> 00:06:58,799
Kaitlyn broke up
with me.

192
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,833
Oh.

193
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:04,302
I mean, not that --
not that --

194
00:07:04,336 --> 00:07:05,936
it's different, though,
right?

195
00:07:05,971 --> 00:07:07,737
I mean,
it probably is way different

196
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:09,472
'cause you guys
are both...

197
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:14,442
you're a girl. She's a girl.
It's different, right?

198
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:16,010
It's totally different.

199
00:07:17,445 --> 00:07:18,511
All right.

200
00:07:18,546 --> 00:07:20,146
My cousin --
she broke up with some guy,

201
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,314
and he came to her house
and killed her guinea pig.

202
00:07:22,348 --> 00:07:23,381
Whoa!

203
00:07:23,415 --> 00:07:26,249
Like, uh, "Fatal Attraction" --
the rabbit.

204
00:07:26,284 --> 00:07:27,918
No, it wasn't a rabbit.

205
00:07:27,952 --> 00:07:29,252
It was a guinea pig.

206
00:07:29,286 --> 00:07:31,386
Yeah. Yeah,
no, I know, but...

207
00:07:31,421 --> 00:07:33,155
You saw
"Fatal Attraction"?

208
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:34,489
Uh-huh.

209
00:07:34,524 --> 00:07:35,424
Yeah.

210
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,692
Yeah, but...
this was a guinea pig.

211
00:07:40,429 --> 00:07:42,164
Anyway, I had a --

212
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:45,202
I broke up with a girl
in 6th grade,

213
00:07:45,236 --> 00:07:47,138
and she, uh...

214
00:07:47,172 --> 00:07:48,840
If I can remember
the quote --

215
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,742
ahe told everybody
I had no wiener.

216
00:07:50,776 --> 00:07:53,377
I'd rather she killed my rabbit.
[ chuckles ]

217
00:07:53,411 --> 00:07:54,511
I don't mean to make fun.

218
00:07:54,546 --> 00:07:56,713
I'm just -- I'm just trying
to lighten it up.

219
00:07:56,748 --> 00:07:58,982
All right.
Let's get some mylar.

220
00:08:00,718 --> 00:08:06,289
2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0.

221
00:08:06,323 --> 00:08:08,124
[ marker clatters ]

222
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:10,093
So, what's wrong
with you guys?

223
00:08:11,662 --> 00:08:15,798
Why do I keep seeing customers
walking out of my showroom?

224
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:18,799
Don't start telling me anything
about the economy.

225
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:23,906
In 1979, during
the Arabian OPEC bullshit,

226
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:27,076
I sold more cars
than anyone else in this city.

227
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:28,344
And do you know how?

228
00:08:28,378 --> 00:08:33,783
Because I could always, always
find "the key."

229
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:36,686
When you've got an up,

230
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,087
you don't just
show him the floor model

231
00:08:39,122 --> 00:08:40,488
and ask about a trade-in.

232
00:08:40,523 --> 00:08:43,056
Hell no.
You find the key.

233
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,657
You get inside of his brain.

234
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,291
You know all about
his old lady nagging him,

235
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:51,060
about how he's nose-deep
in crap-filled diapers.

236
00:08:51,094 --> 00:08:53,829
You work the man.
You find the key.

237
00:08:53,863 --> 00:08:56,097
You got it?

238
00:08:56,132 --> 00:08:57,832
What if the guy's
not married?

239
00:09:03,272 --> 00:09:04,172
Hey, what's going on?

240
00:09:04,206 --> 00:09:05,573
Still no power
at the house.

241
00:09:05,608 --> 00:09:06,574
Still?

242
00:09:06,608 --> 00:09:09,010
I have left five messages
for Gunther.

243
00:09:09,044 --> 00:09:11,445
I'll -- I'll make some calls
to the billing office downtown,

244
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,348
and, um, if the power's
not on by tonight, uh,

245
00:09:14,382 --> 00:09:16,149
we'll just, uh,
check into a hotel.

246
00:09:16,184 --> 00:09:17,517
We can't be spending money
on hotels --

247
00:09:17,551 --> 00:09:19,018
not if we might have to
tear down the house.

248
00:09:19,052 --> 00:09:20,485
What else
are we gonna do?

249
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,619
(Michael)
Grandpa!

250
00:09:21,654 --> 00:09:23,754
Who let these rugrats
in here?

251
00:09:23,789 --> 00:09:25,055
[ laughs ]

252
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:27,523
We're going to stay
at your house, grandpa!

253
00:09:27,558 --> 00:09:28,925
Says who?

254
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,760
Mommy.

255
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,896
Oh. [ chuckles nervously ]
hi, guys.

256
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,410
Do you understand that my home
has no power?

257
00:09:41,411 --> 00:09:44,413
Because my contractor's
an asshole, that's why!

258
00:09:44,448 --> 00:09:47,616
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

259
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:50,117
I will not!
I will not change my tone!

260
00:09:50,151 --> 00:09:52,252
Why don't you change --
why don't you change

261
00:09:52,286 --> 00:09:54,654
and actually do something
that's helpful?

262
00:09:54,688 --> 00:09:56,389
No, no, don't put me on hold.

263
00:09:56,423 --> 00:09:58,757
Aaaaargh!

264
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:00,558
You know,
you watch him move like that,

265
00:10:00,592 --> 00:10:03,060
and it's hard to believe
he's the child of a
professional athlete.

266
00:10:03,094 --> 00:10:05,028
[ shouting ]
more contractor stuff?

267
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,063
I guess.
I don't know.
[ arguing indistinctly ]

268
00:10:07,097 --> 00:10:08,831
I turned him on
to that guy.

269
00:10:08,865 --> 00:10:11,133
He did the siding
on my building. It looks great.

270
00:10:11,167 --> 00:10:12,334
Aaah, shit!

271
00:10:12,368 --> 00:10:13,868
Oh-ho-ho!
Shit, shit!

272
00:10:13,903 --> 00:10:16,003
He's gonna blame me
for this.

273
00:10:16,037 --> 00:10:17,337
You watch.

274
00:10:17,372 --> 00:10:18,471
Oh, yeah. Probably.

275
00:10:18,506 --> 00:10:20,540
[ sighs ]
well, well, well.

276
00:10:20,574 --> 00:10:21,941
Look who's here.

277
00:10:21,975 --> 00:10:23,109
Morning, Laura.

278
00:10:23,143 --> 00:10:24,143
Terrance.

279
00:10:24,177 --> 00:10:25,677
Here you go.

280
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:26,845
Thank you.

281
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,314
You're welcome.

282
00:10:32,885 --> 00:10:33,785
What?

283
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:34,919
When did that happen?

284
00:10:34,953 --> 00:10:36,954
I don't know.
Couple weeks ago.

285
00:10:36,988 --> 00:10:39,390
Turns out we both drove
VW buses in college.

286
00:10:39,424 --> 00:10:40,624
Oh.

287
00:10:40,658 --> 00:10:43,093
You should have a choke collar
on your dick.

288
00:10:43,127 --> 00:10:44,027
[ chuckles ]

289
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:45,228
Hey.

290
00:10:45,262 --> 00:10:46,462
Everything cool?

291
00:10:46,497 --> 00:10:47,830
I don't want
to talk about it.

292
00:10:47,865 --> 00:10:50,733
He's doing
the waitress.

293
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:52,535
What?
Yeah.

294
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,036
[ sighs ]

295
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:55,037
Which one?

296
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:56,972
The -- the tall one.

297
00:10:57,007 --> 00:10:58,873
[ chuckles ] Why you got to shit
where we eat?

298
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,207
Oh, that's nice.

299
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,507
You know,
she's touching our food,

300
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:03,275
and she's been --
she's been near his business.

301
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:06,378
Whoa, whoa. Don't worry. We
always take a shower afterwards.

302
00:11:06,412 --> 00:11:07,312
Gross.

303
00:11:07,346 --> 00:11:09,580
What exactly
did you order me here?

304
00:11:09,614 --> 00:11:11,482
Hey, you know, you're 20 minutes
late every time.

305
00:11:11,516 --> 00:11:12,849
You can't complain
about what I order for you.

306
00:11:12,884 --> 00:11:14,251
Hey, I'm not
20 minutes late.

307
00:11:14,285 --> 00:11:16,620
All right, okay. All right, 15.
Sorry. You're early.

308
00:11:16,754 --> 00:11:19,156
Man, my circadian rhythms
are out of whack.

309
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,158
Annie set the alarm
this morning, and --

310
00:11:21,192 --> 00:11:22,926
Hold it. Annie?

311
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,162
So you got the waitress
and the 25-year-old?

312
00:11:25,196 --> 00:11:27,230
I don't "got" anybody.
[ scoffs ] oh.

313
00:11:27,264 --> 00:11:29,532
Anyway, Annie set the alarm
this morning,

314
00:11:29,566 --> 00:11:32,068
which is a totally
unhealthy way to wake up.

315
00:11:32,102 --> 00:11:33,303
So, from 8:00 to 11:00,

316
00:11:33,337 --> 00:11:35,505
I fall straight back
into a rem sleep,

317
00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:38,708
and then, bam!
Every nine minutes, I'm back up.

318
00:11:38,742 --> 00:11:40,910
Yeah, I hate it when I can't
rem sleep through to 11:00.

319
00:11:40,944 --> 00:11:42,244
Who are you kidding,
anyway?

320
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,512
You're up
every nine minutes

321
00:11:43,547 --> 00:11:45,581
going, "I'm sleeping
with a 25-year-old!"

322
00:11:45,616 --> 00:11:47,283
You're high-fiving
your penis.

323
00:11:47,318 --> 00:11:48,585
All right, all right.

324
00:11:48,619 --> 00:11:51,020
I don't expect you guys
to understand.

325
00:11:51,054 --> 00:11:52,020
I get it.

326
00:11:52,054 --> 00:11:53,954
I know why you like her.

327
00:11:53,989 --> 00:11:55,854
She fills gaps, right?

328
00:11:55,888 --> 00:11:57,420
What?

329
00:11:57,455 --> 00:12:00,086
From "Rocky," man. That's, like,
the best scene in the movie.

330
00:12:00,121 --> 00:12:03,488
Paulie says, "hey, why you
goin' out with my sister?"

331
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:04,589
And Rocky's like,

332
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,424
[ deep voice ] "I got gaps.
"she's got gaps.

333
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:10,393
You know,
together we fill gaps."

334
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:11,861
That's the best scene?

335
00:12:11,896 --> 00:12:12,996
[ normal voice ]
mm-hmm.

336
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,163
In "Rocky"?

337
00:12:14,197 --> 00:12:15,297
Yeah.

338
00:12:15,332 --> 00:12:16,965
Not when he's jumping
at the top of the stairs

339
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,133
with his arms
in the air?

340
00:12:18,168 --> 00:12:20,069
Or "cut me, Mick"?
How 'bout "cut me, mick"?

341
00:12:20,103 --> 00:12:21,303
Or the meat, man!

342
00:12:21,337 --> 00:12:23,638
He's punching the meat
and the music's playing?

343
00:12:23,673 --> 00:12:25,774
"gonna fly now"!
That's the best scene.

344
00:12:25,808 --> 00:12:28,777
No, that's what everybody thi--
that's the obvious, but it's --

345
00:12:28,811 --> 00:12:30,278
That's not even
the best song.

346
00:12:30,312 --> 00:12:32,947
Man, you're not --
nah, you don't get it.

347
00:12:32,981 --> 00:12:34,948
"fills gaps" --
that's deep shit.

348
00:12:34,982 --> 00:12:37,017
I could name
80 other scenes...
No.

349
00:12:37,051 --> 00:12:39,018
... that people remember
more than that one.

350
00:12:39,053 --> 00:12:40,820
Forget it, man.
Forget it.
What?

351
00:12:40,854 --> 00:12:42,288
You know he's not gonna
change his mind.

352
00:12:42,322 --> 00:12:43,655
And this is not
how I want to spend

353
00:12:43,689 --> 00:12:45,624
the last part of my morning
before I go downtown

354
00:12:45,658 --> 00:12:47,125
to convince
some asshole inspector

355
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,926
to let some asshole electrician
wire my house

356
00:12:48,961 --> 00:12:50,594
so I can turn on
my asshole lights.

357
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:51,996
So, forget it.
Forget it.

358
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,163
Okay?

359
00:12:56,534 --> 00:12:58,168
You know, if you want,
I-I can [sighs]

360
00:12:58,202 --> 00:12:59,903
I can help you
get your lights on.

361
00:12:59,937 --> 00:13:01,404
No, no, no. Look.

362
00:13:01,438 --> 00:13:03,439
Two years of stage-lighting
classes in college.

363
00:13:03,473 --> 00:13:05,441
You don't want to let
that knowledge go to waste.

364
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:07,876
No. No, thank you.
You've... done enough.

365
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,914
I told you
he'd blame me.

366
00:13:12,948 --> 00:13:14,515
[ chuckles ]

367
00:13:17,151 --> 00:13:19,619
This is, uh...

368
00:13:19,654 --> 00:13:20,987
This is not good.

369
00:13:21,022 --> 00:13:25,424
I don't even see
an application for a permit.

370
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:28,627
Uh, we think our contractor
was lying to us.

371
00:13:28,662 --> 00:13:30,329
Was this
a, um, small job

372
00:13:30,363 --> 00:13:33,164
that maybe you figured
you didn't need a permit for

373
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:35,199
and then
it turned into a big job?

374
00:13:35,234 --> 00:13:38,001
No. It's the same size
it always was.

375
00:13:38,036 --> 00:13:39,536
I mean,
we added a window

376
00:13:39,571 --> 00:13:42,805
and a, um... portico
or whatever you call it,

377
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,308
but, um, no -- we weren't trying
to get away with anything,

378
00:13:46,342 --> 00:13:47,977
if that's
what you're asking.

379
00:13:48,011 --> 00:13:50,212
Well, I'm sorry,
Mr., uh, Thoreau,

380
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,781
but I'm afraid
I don't have the authority

381
00:13:52,816 --> 00:13:55,016
to allow you
to resume construction.

382
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:57,152
Wait. You know what?
That's -- that's fine.

383
00:13:57,186 --> 00:13:59,388
Hell, I'm happy
just to have a little break

384
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:00,690
from all the hammering.

385
00:14:00,724 --> 00:14:01,857
All we really want to do

386
00:14:01,892 --> 00:14:03,726
is get the electricity
in the main house back on.

387
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:06,962
Why was
the electricity off?

388
00:14:06,996 --> 00:14:09,097
For the construction.

389
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:11,899
But -- but -- but we're not
gonna do any more work.

390
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,001
I wish I could help you,
but it's out of my hands.

391
00:14:14,036 --> 00:14:16,003
And any changes
to the condition of your house

392
00:14:16,038 --> 00:14:19,072
will be considered work
and then subject to more fines.

393
00:14:19,107 --> 00:14:20,340
Believe me,

394
00:14:20,374 --> 00:14:23,176
I'm just trying to save you
from even bigger headaches.

Yo!

398
00:14:39,122 --> 00:14:40,489
What's up, buddy?

399
00:14:40,523 --> 00:14:41,590
Oh, not much.

Where's Lucy?

Who's the guy
she's talking to?

Hey. You okay?

00:15:01,772 --> 00:15:03,206
Uh-huh.

405
00:15:04,608 --> 00:15:07,977
Yeah? You look
a little... flushed.

406

What does that even mean?

00:15:12,214 --> 00:15:13,781
Oh, just -- you know.

00:15:13,816 --> 00:15:15,883
Were you out in the sun
today?

Yeah, I-I guess so.

00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:19,385
Yeah. That's --
that's probably it.

Thanks, mom.

that you ran.

to let off some steam.

You know, honey, your father
has plenty of friends downtown.

I'm sure he can
make a few calls

and get this all
taken care of.

Grandpa,
that's not fair!

What do you mean,
"it's not fair"?

429
00:16:07,261 --> 00:16:09,662
If you let your cards out
for everybody to see,

430
00:16:09,696 --> 00:16:10,829
you're gonna get stung.

let him win?

Well, he's not gonna be 6
forever, now, is he?

436
00:16:19,504 --> 00:16:20,671
If you let them win now,

So not gonna lose.

442
00:16:30,012 --> 00:16:30,979
The point is to win.

443
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:32,647
Okay,
I'll be back in an hour.

444
00:16:32,681 --> 00:16:34,482
An hour?

for a whole hour?

watch your step.

everywhere.

when it's done, huh?

by a criminal.

all soon be gone.

It -- [ sighs ]

459
00:17:05,976 --> 00:17:07,276
Like a box.

know that? I'm a car salesman.

to find a wheel,

I'm gonna go
with something round.

the fastest kid in my gym class,

467
00:17:21,488 --> 00:17:23,989
but I'm at least
in the top eight.
Eight?

468
00:17:24,023 --> 00:17:26,858
Usually when you say a top,
you round it out to, like, 10.

But I'm better
than that.

470
00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:32,095
I mean, if I said "top 10,"
you'd think I was 10.

471
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,263
I'm not.
I'm eight.

472

Yeah, I get it. I get it.
That's pretty good.

Yeah, I am.
Just...A second.

476
00:17:43,005 --> 00:17:44,706
And... done.

477
00:17:46,709 --> 00:17:47,809
Happy?

478
00:17:47,843 --> 00:17:49,043
Yeah. Yeah.

479
00:17:49,077 --> 00:17:51,011
Now, let's -- come on.
Let's talk a little.

480
00:17:51,045 --> 00:17:53,112
I got to pee.
I had two large cokes.

481
00:17:53,146 --> 00:17:56,214
And I licked
all my fries, Albert.

482
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,583
Albert, let me
ask you something --

483
00:17:59,618 --> 00:18:01,551
What do you know
about this Travis guy?

484
00:18:01,586 --> 00:18:03,653
I don't know.

485
00:18:03,688 --> 00:18:06,422
I mean, do you see him
around school? Is he a nice guy?

486
00:18:06,457 --> 00:18:08,057
Yeah, usually.

487
00:18:09,293 --> 00:18:11,093
I guess last week,
he called Lucy a whore.

488
00:18:12,062 --> 00:18:13,028
What?!

489
00:18:13,062 --> 00:18:15,630
Agh! Brain freeze!

490
00:18:15,665 --> 00:18:16,565
What do you mean?

491
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:18,433
It's like nails
in my eyeballs!

Albert, how do you --
how do you --

495
00:18:26,771 --> 00:18:27,971
How do you open this?

496
00:18:28,005 --> 00:18:29,071
To do what?

497
00:18:29,106 --> 00:18:30,973
I don't know. I don't know.
Just read them.

498
00:18:31,007 --> 00:18:31,874
All of them?

00:18:31,908 --> 00:18:34,076
Yeah, yeah. What --

you're doing?

one of your fries.

Whoa.

504

All that happened
in the bathroom?

00:18:51,946 --> 00:18:52,846
Yeah, I'm just...

506
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,348
A friend of mine is supposed to
swing by and pick me up.

507
00:18:55,382 --> 00:18:56,716
Is it the old guy?

508
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,552
Yeah, the old guy.

You know, if it was just me,
I could handle it. You know?

511
00:19:09,226 --> 00:19:10,793
I'm used to it.

512
00:19:10,827 --> 00:19:13,261
But when he starts
dropping that shit on my kids?

513
00:19:13,296 --> 00:19:15,664
Man --
just hold the light up,
would you?

514
00:19:15,698 --> 00:19:17,266
So, how'd you get
out of the house?

515
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,600
I told them
I was going for a run.

516
00:19:18,634 --> 00:19:19,801
And they bought that?

518
00:19:22,971 --> 00:19:24,805
Anyway, thanks for coming out
so quick.

519

You're saving my ass.

You saved mine.

if you hadn't called,

this is -- this is my house.

through a plastic sheet.

what is wrong with you, man?

she's dating a dick.

Why am I a dick?

about the whole thing is you.

Of course, you're not happy
about anything lately.

You're telling me
about taking responsibility?

why you're always late?

I know exactly why.

Really?
I got a whole theory
about it.

Well, please enlighten me,
o great buddha.

602
00:22:05,245 --> 00:22:06,746
When you're late,
all you can think about

603
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,214
is getting to where
you're trying to go --

604
00:22:08,248 --> 00:22:10,115
Traffic, lights,
whatever.

605
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,317
You got no room in your head
for anything else.

606
00:22:12,352 --> 00:22:13,318
But if you're early,

607
00:22:13,353 --> 00:22:15,119
you're not thinking
about that stuff.

608
00:22:15,154 --> 00:22:16,921
Your brain's not occupied
that way.

609
00:22:16,956 --> 00:22:18,723
So your mind drifts.

610
00:22:18,758 --> 00:22:22,595
Maybe you start thinking,
you know, inward --

611
00:22:22,629 --> 00:22:24,997
about your life,
who you are, whatnot.

612
00:22:25,031 --> 00:22:27,065
But you don't want
to do that.

613
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:29,900
The last thing you want
is to look in the mirror

614
00:22:29,935 --> 00:22:31,969
and ask,
"who are you, Terry?"

615
00:22:32,003 --> 00:22:34,338
Because then
you might start thinking

616
00:22:34,372 --> 00:22:35,806
about exactly who you are

617
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,642
and what you're doing
with your life.

618
00:22:40,044 --> 00:22:43,346
That's why
you're late all the time.

619
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:48,516
Well, thank you.

620
00:22:48,551 --> 00:22:49,884
Yeah.

621
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:50,852
That's for free.

622
00:22:50,886 --> 00:22:52,587
Yeah, but you forgot
one thing.

623
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,521
What's that?

624
00:22:53,555 --> 00:22:54,922
The only reason
I'm late right now

625
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:57,258
is because
I was helping you.

It's my fault.

Oh, I should never
have told you about this.

What? No, no. You have to
tell me this stuff, okay?

together. Don't --

00:23:23,308 --> 00:23:25,607
I don't want to worry
that you're not gonna
include me in this stuff.

637
00:23:25,641 --> 00:23:26,840
Yeah, you know what --
I'm sorry, Joe,

638
00:23:26,874 --> 00:23:29,241
but I did include you,
and look what happened.

639
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:31,839
Did you know
Travis called Lucy a whore?

640
00:23:31,873 --> 00:23:33,206
What?

641
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,971
Yeah.
That's why -- that's...

642
00:23:35,005 --> 00:23:35,970
Was that in the text?

643
00:23:36,004 --> 00:23:37,238
No. Albert --
he heard about it at school.

644
00:23:37,272 --> 00:23:38,572
But that's why
I was looking --

645
00:23:38,607 --> 00:23:40,240
to try to see
what else he's saying to her.

646
00:23:40,275 --> 00:23:42,375
Which I would have
found out

647
00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:44,943
if her phone
wasn't a damn rubik's cube.

648
00:23:44,978 --> 00:23:46,978
Why didn't she
tell me that?

649
00:23:47,013 --> 00:23:48,213
I don't...

650
00:23:48,247 --> 00:23:49,614
I don't know.

651
00:23:49,648 --> 00:23:52,082
Even when we were together,
I'd feel like I didn't know

652
00:23:52,117 --> 00:23:53,917
what was going on with her
and all that.

653
00:23:53,952 --> 00:23:55,719
Now it just...
[ sighs ]

654
00:23:55,753 --> 00:23:58,821
Look, I don't know
if she's not talking
to me and that's normal,

655
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:01,490
or if there's something else
going on

656
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:02,925
because of, you know...

657
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:06,495
... us.

658
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:07,496
No, no, no.

659
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,265
Look, it's okay.
It's all right.

660
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:12,767
We'll figure this all out.

661
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,806
Yeah, okay.

662
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,573
It's all right.

663
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,543
Well, we're definitely
getting her a new phone,

664
00:24:23,577 --> 00:24:24,911
because that thing's
a nightmare.

665
00:24:24,945 --> 00:24:27,346
Right? You couldn't
figure it out, either.
It's impossible.

666
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,047
Soon they're all gonna have
the gps-tracking thing.

667
00:24:29,082 --> 00:24:30,482
Oh, we're getting
that shit.

668
00:24:30,516 --> 00:24:31,649
[ laughs ]

669
00:24:31,684 --> 00:24:33,685
(Sharon)
All we were saying is --

670
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:35,687
Okay. They're down.

671
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:36,654
Phew!

672
00:24:36,689 --> 00:24:38,256
So, if it comes up,

673
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:41,026
I was helping those cops
to look for a dog.

674
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,294
Your father and I
have talked it over,

675
00:24:43,329 --> 00:24:46,464
and we feel like the best way
to handle this situation

676
00:24:46,499 --> 00:24:48,466
is for you
to just pay the fines

677
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,268
and do whatever it takes
to get the job finished.

678
00:24:51,303 --> 00:24:54,238
Well, we may have to rebuild,
and we can't afford that.

679
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,807
If it comes to that,
we'll cover it.

680
00:24:56,841 --> 00:24:59,409
But you two
need a home to live in.

681
00:24:59,443 --> 00:25:00,743
Mom,
that's very kind of you,

682
00:25:00,778 --> 00:25:03,412
but, uh, I'm telling you --
we can handle it.

683
00:25:03,446 --> 00:25:04,513
Your way of "handling it"

684
00:25:04,547 --> 00:25:06,481
almost got you thrown in jail,
today, son,

685
00:25:06,515 --> 00:25:08,116
which is where
you would have been

686
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,784
if they hadn't
recognized me.

687
00:25:09,818 --> 00:25:11,785
What would you
have me do, dad?

688
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:14,954
Sit here and watch you
make my kids cry at cards?

689
00:25:23,427 --> 00:25:25,294
Melissa,
talk to your husband.

690
00:25:25,328 --> 00:25:28,530
Sharon,
I'm going to bed.

691
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:31,366
[ grunts ]

692
00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:35,370
Would you just please
think about it?

693
00:25:39,974 --> 00:25:42,508
If they help us,
he will never let me forget it.

694
00:25:42,543 --> 00:25:43,476
You know that.

695
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,244
I do know the man,
yes.

696
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,646
We didn't do
anything wrong.

697
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,847
Honey, I don't think
that's the point anymore.

698
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:50,115
Well, what, then?
What do we do?

699
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:52,249
I don't know.

700
00:25:52,283 --> 00:25:54,383
Go downtown again.

701
00:25:54,417 --> 00:25:55,917
They don't want to help you
down there.

702
00:25:55,951 --> 00:25:57,717
All they want to do is
check your name off some list

703
00:25:57,752 --> 00:25:59,318
so -- so it looks like
they did something.

704
00:25:59,353 --> 00:26:02,552
Look, you're --
you're a salesman, right?

705
00:26:02,586 --> 00:26:04,786
So go do some selling.

706
00:26:04,821 --> 00:26:07,054
Find the key.

707
00:26:08,089 --> 00:26:09,288
You know that's bullshit,
right?

708
00:26:09,322 --> 00:26:10,620
Then we're gonna be

709
00:26:10,654 --> 00:26:13,121
spending a hell of a lot more
time with your parents.

710
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,891
[ engine turns over ]

711
00:26:43,065 --> 00:26:45,132
[ engine shuts off ]

712
00:26:56,975 --> 00:26:58,675
Aaah!

713
00:27:00,444 --> 00:27:02,044
Open up.

714
00:27:11,347 --> 00:27:12,915
Did you call my daughter
a whore?

715
00:27:13,449 --> 00:27:14,416
No.

716
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,917
'cause I got to tell you,
as a parent,

717
00:27:15,952 --> 00:27:17,852
that's not the kind of thing
you want to hear.

718
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:19,387
I didn't call her that.

719
00:27:19,421 --> 00:27:20,922
Really?
'cause I heard you did.

720
00:27:20,956 --> 00:27:22,323
Well, I didn't.

721
00:27:27,294 --> 00:27:28,628
This is stupid.
I'm gonna get Lucy.

722
00:27:28,663 --> 00:27:29,996
We're gonna
straighten all this out.

723
00:27:30,031 --> 00:27:31,332
What?! No, wait!

724
00:27:31,366 --> 00:27:32,866
What?

725
00:27:36,538 --> 00:27:38,605
She dumped me, okay?

726
00:27:39,974 --> 00:27:42,475
And...I don't know.
I...

727
00:27:42,509 --> 00:27:45,444
I kind of lost my mind,
and I got angry.

728
00:27:45,478 --> 00:27:48,513
And when I tried to make her
talk to me about it...

729
00:27:50,048 --> 00:27:51,415
... I called her a whore.

730
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,884
But it was because
she wouldn't let me talk.

731
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,420
It's not because
she's actually like a whore

732
00:27:56,454 --> 00:27:57,688
or anything like that.

733
00:27:57,722 --> 00:27:59,255
I swear.

734
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:01,724
I mean,
even if she was a whore,

735
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:03,593
I'd still, you know...

736
00:28:06,396 --> 00:28:08,430
[ voice breaking ]
she's just...

737
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,467
she's so great.

738
00:28:16,771 --> 00:28:17,804
Okay.

739
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:19,706
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

740
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:21,941
All right, just calm down.

741
00:28:21,976 --> 00:28:26,278
I just wanted her
to like me again.

742
00:28:28,113 --> 00:28:32,149
I wanted everything
to be the way it was.

743
00:28:34,485 --> 00:28:36,252
Look, you're --
you're in high school.

744
00:28:36,286 --> 00:28:37,753
This is --
it's what happens.

745
00:28:37,787 --> 00:28:40,288
No.
It's not like that.

746
00:28:40,323 --> 00:28:42,290
Like,
when we were together,

747
00:28:42,324 --> 00:28:45,025
it was...

748
00:28:48,262 --> 00:28:51,198
[ sighs ]

749
00:28:51,232 --> 00:28:52,698
I was...

750
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:54,166
I don't know.

751
00:28:56,802 --> 00:28:59,303
She fills gaps, right?

752
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:01,906
Huh?

753
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,007
Gaps.

754
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:06,809
You've got gaps.
She's got gaps.

755
00:29:06,843 --> 00:29:08,977
And when
you're together...

756
00:29:09,012 --> 00:29:10,612
you fill gaps.

757
00:29:10,646 --> 00:29:12,613
Yeah.

758
00:29:12,648 --> 00:29:13,581
Yeah.

759
00:29:13,615 --> 00:29:15,149
Yeah. I guess.

760
00:29:15,183 --> 00:29:17,084
You remember that?
From "Rocky"?

761
00:29:17,118 --> 00:29:19,152
What's "Rocky"?

762
00:29:20,754 --> 00:29:22,321
Doesn't matter.

763
00:29:24,324 --> 00:29:27,225
It's just -- look.

764
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:29,026
I get it.

765
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,064
So, what now?

766
00:29:33,098 --> 00:29:35,899
Everything go back
to sucking?

767
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:42,004
Yeah, pretty much.

768
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,406
Not forever, though.

769
00:29:45,441 --> 00:29:47,742
Feels like forever.

770
00:29:47,776 --> 00:29:50,411
Look, Travis...

771
00:29:50,446 --> 00:29:51,779
it's hard. I know.

772
00:29:51,813 --> 00:29:54,414
It's hard.
You found somebody special.

773
00:29:54,448 --> 00:29:55,414
Yeah.

774
00:29:55,449 --> 00:29:57,216
And -- and --
and you probably thought

775
00:29:57,251 --> 00:29:59,585
you're gonna spend
the rest of your life with her.

776
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,520
Yeah.

777
00:30:00,554 --> 00:30:02,855
Yeah, and -- and --
and you think,

778
00:30:02,889 --> 00:30:05,924
"boy, I'm never gonna find
anybody like this ever again."

779
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:07,725
That's how you feel.

780
00:30:10,462 --> 00:30:14,164
I don't have
any magic words, but...

781
00:30:14,198 --> 00:30:15,532
all I can tell you

782
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:18,868
is sometimes you got to feel
as bad as you possibly can

783
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:20,736
before you feel better.

784
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:23,005
And...

785
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,873
you will --
you're gonna find somebody.

786
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:26,575
You're gonna meet somebody
again.

787
00:30:26,609 --> 00:30:29,377
I know you don't believe me
right now, but...

788
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:31,112
you will.

789
00:30:31,146 --> 00:30:34,015
And you know what?

790
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:36,016
Maybe the next one --
maybe that's --

791
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:38,251
maybe that's the girl
you're gonna marry.

792
00:30:38,285 --> 00:30:39,252
And who knows?

793
00:30:39,286 --> 00:30:41,488
You may have a daughter
one day,

794
00:30:41,523 --> 00:30:44,624
and there may be a boy
who falls in love with her,

795
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:46,659
and he may
call her a name.

796

00:40:22,705 --> 00:40:24,506
We don't open

I don't care!

959
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,507

Let me ask you --

979
00:41:42,204 --> 00:41:45,540
You ever look in the mirror
and ask, "who are you?"

980
00:41:45,574 --> 00:41:46,774
No.
