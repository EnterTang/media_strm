of an incredible adventure.

I'm going 10,000 miles from
the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean,

3
00:00:11,764 --> 00:00:15,040
and I'm doing it the hard way,
above the Arctic Circle

4
00:00:15,124 --> 00:00:18,434
by a legendary route, the Northwest Passage,

5
00:00:18,724 --> 00:00:21,284
the mythical sea route
across the top of Canada,

6
00:00:21,364 --> 00:00:23,116
linking two oceans.

7
00:00:23,484 --> 00:00:24,758
Whoa!

8
00:00:26,844 --> 00:00:29,119
How unbelievable is this?

9
00:00:29,244 --> 00:00:31,394
lt's like being on another planet.

10
00:00:31,484 --> 00:00:35,636
I'm going to places I've never seen before,
meet people I've never met before

11
00:00:35,724 --> 00:00:38,238
and do things I've never done before.

12
00:00:42,924 --> 00:00:45,961
lt's an absolute sensation.

13
00:00:46,764 --> 00:00:50,234
I'm going on the most extraordinary journey
of my life,

14
00:00:50,364 --> 00:00:53,322
one that some of the world's
greatest sailors and adventurers

15
00:00:53,404 --> 00:00:55,201
have tried to make and failed,

16
00:00:55,284 --> 00:00:59,163
and one that's going to take me
to the very edge of the world.

17
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:02,562
Why don't you come with me?
We'll have a laugh.

18
00:01:37,204 --> 00:01:38,717
Piece of cake.

19
00:01:40,204 --> 00:01:43,435
l'm on the threshold
of an extraordinary adventure

20
00:01:43,524 --> 00:01:46,960
right across the top of Canada
between the two oceans.

21
00:01:48,084 --> 00:01:51,474
For centuries, people have dreamed of
the Northwest Passage as a trade route,

22
00:01:51,564 --> 00:01:53,634
but it was always iced up.

23
00:01:54,204 --> 00:01:56,843
Now, with the changing climate,
the melting ice should clear

24
00:01:56,924 --> 00:02:00,394
for just enough time for me to go
and have a wee look.

25
00:02:00,804 --> 00:02:04,080
My journey starts on the Atlantic coast
of Canada in Nova Scotia,

26
00:02:04,164 --> 00:02:08,715
and then it's north through Newfoundland,
down to Baffin Island above the Arctic Circle,

27
00:02:08,804 --> 00:02:10,874
and then through
the Northwest Passage itself,

28
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,513
before heading south through the Yukon
to British Columbia,

29
00:02:14,604 --> 00:02:18,643
and my final destination, Vancouver Island,
on the Pacific coast.

You and me, we're gonna do it together,
and it's gonna be fun.

It's gonna be an epic journey.

By God, it's parky out today.

I'm getting very excited

This journey could be longer than 10 weeks.

50

Just like countless explorers and pioneers
before me

51
00:03:26,924 --> 00:03:29,279
who braved the North Atlantic
to reach America,

there's no better way to start an adventure
than to arrive by boat.

For the first leg of my journey,
I'm going to explore Canada's Atlantic coast,

54
00:03:47,764 --> 00:03:50,836
and I'm starting here at Halifax, Nova Scotia.

55
00:03:51,804 --> 00:03:56,275
Today it's a busy seaport, but this was once
the gateway for hordes of Europeans

56
00:03:56,364 --> 00:04:01,119
who'd come here to make a new life in
what was for them the edge of the world.

This is a very famous place, Pier 21,

58
00:04:07,604 --> 00:04:10,676
where millions of immigrants landed,
almost two million,

59
00:04:10,764 --> 00:04:14,643
people from Europe coming here to settle
in Canada for one reason or another.

lt's sort of Canada's Ellis lsland.

61

These days it's where cruise ships dock
and tourists are welcomed ashore,

62
00:04:21,124 --> 00:04:24,321
and it's a much happier place
than it used to be.

This is kind of welcoming
and happy, jolly music.

73
00:04:57,484 --> 00:05:00,999
But there's also really sad music
associated with this,

and, actually, more in lreland

There was music...
They called it an American wake.

76

When you were leaving to come here,
they would have your wake,

while you were still alive, playing music,

'cause they knew they were never
going to see you again,

so coming here was like dying.

That's wonderful, isn't it?

With its town crier and museum,

although they were given a lovely welcome.

your family paid for a bigger stone.

-So it was an extra expense.
-Oh, really?

So, for instance, here's Mr Elliott,
the family paid extra for this.

He was a crew member, and they were mad
that the newspaper of the day

152
00:09:24,604 --> 00:09:27,323
The grave just says ''J. Dawson''.

153
00:09:28,404 --> 00:09:30,964
But it's a guy called Joseph Dawson.

154
00:09:31,324 --> 00:09:34,680
But nobody seems to be bothered too much
about that.

155
00:09:34,924 --> 00:09:38,758
So in death he became sexy in Hollywood.

156
00:09:40,004 --> 00:09:41,756
Good on him, l say.

157
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:51,839
I'm leaving Halifax behind me for the next leg
of my epic journey to the edge of the world.

158
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,234
I'm heading for the coast
for a spot of cod fishing.

159
00:09:59,044 --> 00:10:03,595
As I hit the road, the scale of this trip
is just beginning to dawn on me.

160
00:10:04,924 --> 00:10:08,473
l'm taking 10 weeks to cross Canada,
and it's a big journey,

161
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:13,513
and it gives you an extraordinary feeling
of how enormous this country is.

162
00:10:15,244 --> 00:10:18,919
Nova Scotia is just the first square
on the Monopoly board,

163
00:10:19,004 --> 00:10:21,279
and I've got the whole nation to cross.

164
00:10:21,364 --> 00:10:24,242
But I'm excited by the adventure of it all.

165
00:10:24,684 --> 00:10:26,242
I've come to Lunenburg.

166
00:10:26,324 --> 00:10:31,079
For over 200 years, this was North America's
fishing capital and cod was king.

167
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:35,518
Fishing was a way of life for generations
of people who came over from Europe.

168
00:10:35,604 --> 00:10:39,392
But years of overfishing have meant the cod
has pretty much gone,

169
00:10:39,484 --> 00:10:42,157
and Lunenburg now survives on tourism.

170
00:10:42,964 --> 00:10:44,795
Welcome to Lunenburg.

171
00:10:46,724 --> 00:10:50,558
Haven't been here 24 hours,
and l've got the Nova Scotia hat.

172
00:10:50,844 --> 00:10:52,596
Tourist till l die.

173
00:10:54,124 --> 00:10:55,352
What? You got doughnuts?

174
00:10:55,444 --> 00:10:58,242
-Yeah, we eat doughnuts.
-Just in case you get hungry.

175
00:10:59,724 --> 00:11:04,434
I'm going out fishing with Bobby and Ralph.
They've worked these waters all their lives.

176
00:11:04,524 --> 00:11:06,799
I'm hoping to catch some cod for my lunch.

177
00:11:06,884 --> 00:11:11,162
But it's now in such short supply,
there's no guarantee I'll get any.

178
00:11:13,004 --> 00:11:15,234
There is no cod fishing here any more.

179
00:11:15,324 --> 00:11:17,679
l think we're a lot to blame for it,
ourselves, you know.

180
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:21,120
We destroyed a lot of fish back in the years.

181
00:11:22,204 --> 00:11:24,718
Commercial cod fishing is now banned.

182
00:11:24,804 --> 00:11:28,638
But it's okay if we try to catch the odd one
by hook and line.

183
00:11:29,364 --> 00:11:31,480
l've never seen a hook
that's circular like that.

184
00:11:31,564 --> 00:11:35,716
And the way the fishing is right now,
if you get one on, you don't want to lose it.

185
00:11:35,804 --> 00:11:37,795
'Cause it's a long time
before another one comes by.

186
00:11:37,884 --> 00:11:39,112
Exactly right.

187
00:11:39,204 --> 00:11:41,877
l'll see if l can get the bait first.

188
00:11:42,644 --> 00:11:45,920
l'm gonna try and catch a fishy.
Ah, here we are.

189
00:11:46,764 --> 00:11:49,437
-You can't talk a fish into existence.
-No, you can't.

190
00:11:49,524 --> 00:11:52,960
They say... What is it?
''A fool on one end and a fish on the other.''

191
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:55,239
Well, you got a fishing line, so...

192
00:11:55,324 --> 00:11:59,875
lt's good fun when they're biting,
but it's not much fun when they're not.

193
00:12:00,204 --> 00:12:03,037
Not so long ago, fish would have
been leaping into the boat

194
00:12:03,124 --> 00:12:06,036
just to have a wee nosey, but not any more.

195
00:12:06,284 --> 00:12:07,603
I don't really mind, though.

196
00:12:07,684 --> 00:12:10,756
It's just a delight to be at sea
in this cocoon of fog,

197
00:12:10,844 --> 00:12:13,358
fishing with these two lovely guys.

198
00:12:13,764 --> 00:12:15,402
Did you spit on your bait?

199
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,520
-No, l said a wee prayer.
-Did you?

200
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:20,562
lt wasn't a big enough one, l don't believe.

201
00:12:21,764 --> 00:12:23,516
-Quite a tail, look.
-BlLLY: You caught a bit of tail.

202
00:12:23,604 --> 00:12:26,596
RALPH: Not quite a codfish, but it is a fish.

203
00:12:28,884 --> 00:12:30,715
The thieving bastard.

204
00:12:35,404 --> 00:12:38,874
l'm glad we're not doing this for a living,
aren't you?

205
00:12:39,124 --> 00:12:41,797
Fishing is a hard life, and dangerous.

206
00:12:42,404 --> 00:12:44,759
Bobby wasn't going to tell me
till I squeezed it out of him,

207
00:12:44,844 --> 00:12:48,678
but he nearly lost his life in '93
when his boat was completely iced up

208
00:12:48,764 --> 00:12:50,720
and started to capsize.

209
00:12:51,364 --> 00:12:53,832
They figure it was 35 below, the wind chill.

210
00:12:53,924 --> 00:12:56,677
They estimate it was about 70 tons of ice
on the frozen...

211
00:12:56,764 --> 00:12:58,561
Seventy tons of ice clinging to your boat?

212
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:01,158
Yeah, froze to the side of the boat.

213
00:13:02,524 --> 00:13:05,436
-And that's what threw it off balance?
-Yeah.

214
00:13:05,604 --> 00:13:09,756
She just made that last heave under
and started to load herself full of water.

215
00:13:09,844 --> 00:13:12,404
There was no recovering it then,
just kept sinking.

216
00:13:12,484 --> 00:13:13,837
How did that feel?

217
00:13:13,924 --> 00:13:14,913
(LAUGHlNG)

218
00:13:15,004 --> 00:13:17,313
lt wasn't the best of feelings.

219
00:13:18,484 --> 00:13:22,602
Bobby was rescued, but it ended in tragedy
for some of his friends.

220
00:13:22,684 --> 00:13:25,517
There was five fellows we lost that time.

221
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,720
And them fellows, l don't know
what really happened to 'em.

222
00:13:27,804 --> 00:13:31,558
We picked up three of the bodies
and two of them didn't even get off the boat.

223
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,157
-Really?
-Yeah.

224
00:13:34,324 --> 00:13:38,602
It's a terrifying story,
and I so admire how Bobby has dealt with it,

225
00:13:38,924 --> 00:13:40,596
and has kept his love of the sea.

226
00:13:40,684 --> 00:13:42,402
lt's good to be out here.

227
00:13:42,484 --> 00:13:47,433
l can't imagine being on a fishing boat
at 35 below, 150 miles off shore,

228
00:13:48,164 --> 00:13:51,236
with ice all clinging to your boat
and wondering if you're going to get home.

229
00:13:51,324 --> 00:13:54,202
l can't imagine anything harder than that.

230
00:13:54,644 --> 00:13:58,273
-We're not very good fishermen.
-No, we're pretty crap, aren't we?

231
00:13:58,364 --> 00:14:00,514
We wouldn't make much money.

232
00:14:00,604 --> 00:14:03,323
-We tell a good tale, though.
-Oh, yeah.

233
00:14:04,004 --> 00:14:05,278
Oh!

234
00:14:05,604 --> 00:14:09,597
At long last, our fortunes change,
but it's not cod.

235
00:14:09,684 --> 00:14:11,117
l've got some mackerel.

236
00:14:11,204 --> 00:14:12,319
Whoa!

237
00:14:14,044 --> 00:14:15,636
(WHOOPlNG)

238
00:14:18,404 --> 00:14:21,282
RALPH: Holy mackerel,
them are the big ones!

239
00:14:21,404 --> 00:14:23,235
lt's mackerel-o-rama.

240
00:14:24,524 --> 00:14:26,242
lt's funny, we get nothing for ages,

241
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:29,680
and now we can't put the hooks
back in quick enough.

242
00:14:30,284 --> 00:14:32,320
We did catch one cod, by the way,

243
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:35,601
but he was such a wee tiddler,
we threw him back.

244
00:14:36,404 --> 00:14:40,238
RALPH: That's one of our codfish,
but he will grow, hopefully.

245
00:14:40,764 --> 00:14:43,324
It's so sad that as the cod fishing has gone,

246
00:14:43,404 --> 00:14:47,079
guys like Bobby and Ralph have
become a dying breed of men.

247
00:14:47,244 --> 00:14:51,203
A way of life that brought
so many people here, just wiped out.

248
00:14:56,004 --> 00:14:59,963
The old fishing livelihood may be gone,
but next, I'm heading north

249
00:15:00,044 --> 00:15:04,640
to where some surprising old country
customs are very much alive and kicking.

250
00:15:12,524 --> 00:15:15,880
So where do you think you might be?
Oban? lnverness?

251
00:15:16,284 --> 00:15:18,639
Aberdeenshire? Mallaig?

252
00:15:19,724 --> 00:15:21,237
We're in New Brunswick.

253
00:15:21,364 --> 00:15:24,242
Since 1 753, people have been coming here
from Scotland,

254
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:25,962
since the Highland Clearances, really.

255
00:15:26,044 --> 00:15:30,356
And they tend to cling to the culture
of what they see as the culture.

256
00:15:30,844 --> 00:15:33,756
Personally, l have mixed feelings about it.

257
00:15:33,964 --> 00:15:35,602
You have a big head?

258
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,037
That's not bad.

259
00:15:37,124 --> 00:15:38,682
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, that's fabulous.

260
00:15:38,764 --> 00:15:40,800
Can l have a picture with you
and that hat on?

261
00:15:40,884 --> 00:15:42,317
No. How dare you? Leave me alone.

262
00:15:42,404 --> 00:15:43,757
(LAUGHlNG)

263
00:15:44,884 --> 00:15:48,513
I think it's a New World thing,
a need for something old.

264
00:15:48,644 --> 00:15:51,556
And they seem to assume
that old means good.

265
00:15:52,804 --> 00:15:55,716
When l was a wee boy,
not only didn't we wear kilts,

266
00:15:55,804 --> 00:15:57,999
we frowned on people who did.

267
00:15:58,284 --> 00:16:01,196
We used to shout, ''Kilty, kilty, cold bum!''

268
00:16:01,604 --> 00:16:06,280
And to this day,
l am wary of people who wear kilts.

269
00:16:09,164 --> 00:16:12,474
But then there are bits of Scottish culture
I just love,

270
00:16:12,564 --> 00:16:16,034
and it's hard for me not to get carried away
by it all.

271
00:16:16,404 --> 00:16:18,360
This is the real thing.

272
00:16:20,804 --> 00:16:23,796
lt's poetry. lt's wordless poetry.

273
00:16:25,724 --> 00:16:29,034
The band of Scots that landed here
has clung on to its Highland traditions

274
00:16:29,124 --> 00:16:31,433
and kept them remarkably intact.

275
00:16:33,164 --> 00:16:37,043
This sport shows you how boring life was
in Highland villages.

276
00:16:37,284 --> 00:16:40,594
The people would say,
''Let's throw trees this afternoon.

277
00:16:40,684 --> 00:16:43,801
''l know what we'll do.
We'll throw a tree up in the air.''

278
00:16:43,884 --> 00:16:46,557
His underwear's a bit on the long side.

279
00:16:46,644 --> 00:16:50,557
Y-fronts don't cut it.
Calvin Klein means nothing here.

280
00:16:51,324 --> 00:16:53,280
Here we go. Here we go.

281
00:16:54,684 --> 00:16:59,235
Oh, yes! Perfect! Perfect! Excellent!

282
00:17:01,644 --> 00:17:05,683
I think culture should be constantly
on the move, forever changing.

283
00:17:06,044 --> 00:17:10,481
But people here seem to relish being
more Scottish than the Scots themselves.

284
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:13,032
-Hello, Sean, how do you do?
-Mr Connolly, good to meet you.

285
00:17:13,124 --> 00:17:14,523
-Nice to see you, yeah.
-You as well.

286
00:17:14,604 --> 00:17:18,483
l've seen people here who've never been
in Scotland who are wearing all the stuff

287
00:17:18,564 --> 00:17:21,078
and a very Scottish air about it.
How do you feel about that?

288
00:17:21,164 --> 00:17:23,473
When we get here,
we get amongst these people,

289
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:26,476
and we wear the kilt and we hear bagpipes,
something...

290
00:17:26,564 --> 00:17:29,522
All the worries of life go away.
lt just makes us feel good.

291
00:17:29,604 --> 00:17:30,798
l can understand that.

292
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:34,081
Most of these people here aren't
really working to be Scottish.

293
00:17:34,164 --> 00:17:37,236
-They're just out enjoying being Scottish.
-They're just enjoying themselves.

294
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:40,157
l've got nothing against that whatsoever.

295
00:17:42,284 --> 00:17:46,835
l don't know if this is the direction
l would have gone in, if l was an immigrant.

296
00:17:47,204 --> 00:17:51,163
In one way I find it refreshing, in another way
I find it kind of very mysterious.

297
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:54,236
I find myself being swung towards
their way of thinking.

298
00:17:54,964 --> 00:17:57,239
But then again, I was always easily led.

299
00:17:57,484 --> 00:17:59,236
l think you can tell.

300
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:03,119
Direct from Scotland, we have a visitor,
Mr Billy Connolly.

301
00:18:06,324 --> 00:18:10,397
And when the massed bands strike up,
something stirs in me.

302
00:18:13,924 --> 00:18:18,156
No matter how much l try not to like this,
l love it.

303
00:18:18,684 --> 00:18:22,120
l go all wobbly inside. l can't help it.

304
00:18:22,204 --> 00:18:26,641
When the drums and pipes go, it's just...
l'm putty in their hands.

305
00:18:29,604 --> 00:18:32,914
You can't refuse an occasion
to make Scottish cool.

306
00:18:33,324 --> 00:18:35,394
And it really is pretty nifty.

307
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:42,440
As I hit the road,
with the music still ringing in my ears,

308
00:18:42,524 --> 00:18:46,676
I think I can see why all this Scottishness
is so strong over here.

309
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:55,157
l think it's the size of the place,
and the amount of wilderness

310
00:18:55,484 --> 00:18:58,317
that makes them so keen on their culture.

311
00:18:58,644 --> 00:19:02,114
Anything that you can grab
that makes you feel at home

312
00:19:02,564 --> 00:19:04,759
must bring you great solace.

313
00:19:06,844 --> 00:19:09,722
I've driven through Nova Scotia
to Cape Breton Island,

314
00:19:09,804 --> 00:19:12,557
where I'm heading towards a town
called Cheticamp,

315
00:19:12,644 --> 00:19:16,842
where I'm going to meet a different group of
settlers that have made their colourful mark.

316
00:19:16,924 --> 00:19:20,633
Before this was ever Nova Scotia,
it was called New France.

317
00:19:20,884 --> 00:19:23,239
And hereabouts,
the people still speak French.

318
00:19:23,324 --> 00:19:27,954
They call themselves Acadians, descendants
of 17th-century French colonists.

319
00:19:32,164 --> 00:19:35,873
There's a distinctly odd feel to this place,
and I like it.

320
00:19:36,604 --> 00:19:40,074
What l'm looking forward to,
there's a scarecrow maker.

321
00:19:40,204 --> 00:19:43,594
l've never met a scarecrow maker before.
l never thought there were such things.

322
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:47,199
l thought farmers just hammered them
together from brushes and old clothes.

323
00:19:47,524 --> 00:19:49,958
This should be a bit interesting.

324
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:52,880
Oh, God, it's quite scary!

325
00:19:54,084 --> 00:19:57,235
Look at that line at the back.
That is so weird.

326
00:19:58,924 --> 00:20:00,118
Oh, l like this.

327
00:20:00,204 --> 00:20:04,163
There's a funky, weird edge to this
that l'm beginning to like.

328
00:20:06,284 --> 00:20:07,922
Stone the crows.

329
00:20:10,284 --> 00:20:12,081
lt's... l can't explain it to you.

330
00:20:12,164 --> 00:20:15,952
l think it's because they're absolute life-size
with real clothes on.

331
00:20:16,044 --> 00:20:19,514
There's a definite Village of the Damned
feel about it.

332
00:20:20,404 --> 00:20:25,762
l think it's this thing. l think it's this pose.
lt's like some kind of satanic rite.

333
00:20:27,164 --> 00:20:30,361
Oh, God, Margaret Thatcher's here,
of all people.

334
00:20:31,404 --> 00:20:33,838
lt gets more bizarre by the yard.

335
00:20:35,764 --> 00:20:37,561
l love these things.

336
00:20:40,004 --> 00:20:42,359
The other visitors, they're just like me.

337
00:20:42,444 --> 00:20:46,073
People are, you know...
The average expression is...

338
00:20:47,044 --> 00:20:49,512
What the fudd is this?

339
00:20:50,404 --> 00:20:54,158
lsn't it odd? l mean,
l don't know if you can feel it up the lens.

340
00:20:54,244 --> 00:20:59,193
lt's like getting into a graveyard and finding
all the people standing, l'm telling you.

341
00:20:59,284 --> 00:21:02,196
I was wondering what kind of oddball
was behind all this,

342
00:21:02,284 --> 00:21:05,082
when Chester shows up,
and he's a true delight.

343
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:07,200
-How are you?
-How do you do? Billy Connolly.

344
00:21:07,284 --> 00:21:09,240
-Are you Chester Delaney?
-Pleased to meet you.

345
00:21:09,324 --> 00:21:12,043
What a delight. How nice to meet you.
l was just talking about your stuff.

346
00:21:12,124 --> 00:21:14,513
l was... They call me the artist.

347
00:21:14,604 --> 00:21:15,957
(LAUGHlNG)

348
00:21:16,564 --> 00:21:18,475
-How dare they?
-Yeah, yeah.

349
00:21:18,564 --> 00:21:22,273
-So this is your stuff. That's extraordinary.
-This is all my scarecrows.

350
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,480
-And l have 90.
-Ninety?

351
00:21:24,564 --> 00:21:26,236
Ninety scarecrows, yes.

352
00:21:26,324 --> 00:21:30,681
And l dress them all new every year.
l've been doing that since the last 13 years.

353
00:21:30,764 --> 00:21:34,040
-There's something wrong with you.
-No, they tell me l'm all right.

354
00:21:34,964 --> 00:21:37,114
-l dress them all new every year.
-Nobody's ever told me that.

355
00:21:37,204 --> 00:21:38,842
lt's a big job.

356
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:41,996
lt is very unusual.

357
00:21:42,284 --> 00:21:45,162
l try to put, see, a little note
on each one of them.

358
00:21:45,244 --> 00:21:49,203
Like, even that guy that l call Wayne.
Like, he died two years ago.

359
00:21:49,284 --> 00:21:52,082
But he was a miner.
He worked hard all his life.

360
00:21:52,164 --> 00:21:55,998
So that's why l put ''Wayne Collins''
on the scarecrow.

361
00:21:56,084 --> 00:22:00,043
-Yeah, so now that's a memorial to him.
-Yes, that's what it is.

362
00:22:00,204 --> 00:22:04,516
''l'm a working man, l am.
And l'll go down underground. l'm Wayne.''

363
00:22:04,804 --> 00:22:08,797
''Shift work took me out the door
till Sydney Steel was no more.''

364
00:22:09,924 --> 00:22:12,836
Oh, l found Pamela. She's changed.

365
00:22:14,324 --> 00:22:17,555
The witch. l'm not sure about that at all.

366
00:22:18,844 --> 00:22:21,438
Don't know if my wife will approve that.

367
00:22:21,524 --> 00:22:23,515
-Now, l have a little surprise for you.
-Oh, yeah?

368
00:22:23,604 --> 00:22:25,435
-Would you come here with me?
-Aye.

369
00:22:25,604 --> 00:22:27,799
Oh, my God!

370
00:22:28,324 --> 00:22:30,758
Oh, l've joined the merry throng.

371
00:22:31,964 --> 00:22:35,195
When I was a child,
my ambition was to be a tramp.

372
00:22:36,124 --> 00:22:39,082
And l've actually... l've almost reached it.

373
00:22:42,484 --> 00:22:45,396
(SlNGlNG lN FRENCH)

374
00:23:08,324 --> 00:23:11,953
What a smashing man
playing absolutely smashing music.

375
00:23:12,044 --> 00:23:13,682
There's no mistake he plays well.

376
00:23:13,764 --> 00:23:16,198
You know, his art is good. His life is good.

377
00:23:16,284 --> 00:23:18,195
He's a true, nice man.

378
00:23:19,644 --> 00:23:21,123
What a jolly day!

379
00:23:21,804 --> 00:23:22,919
You crazy people.

380
00:23:23,564 --> 00:23:25,919
You are. You're French.
That's what's wrong with you.

381
00:23:32,764 --> 00:23:34,880
BlLLY: I like this bit of the world. It's happy.

382
00:23:34,964 --> 00:23:37,797
There's a continental happiness
that really appeals to me.

383
00:23:40,764 --> 00:23:42,880
Even the landscape lifts your spirit.

384
00:23:45,364 --> 00:23:48,322
Just north of Cheticamp is
the scenic Cabot Trail,

385
00:23:48,404 --> 00:23:50,838
named after the early explorer John Cabot.

386
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:55,152
It winds around the rocky splendour
of Cape Breton's western shore

387
00:23:55,244 --> 00:23:58,281
and it's taking me up to the northernmost tip
of Nova Scotia.

388
00:23:58,364 --> 00:24:01,595
And there's only one way to do it justice.

389
00:24:05,124 --> 00:24:09,242
The Cabot Trail is one
of the top five motorcycle rides in the world.

390
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:12,555
I can understand why. It's spectacular.

391
00:24:26,124 --> 00:24:28,354
What a stunning place.

392
00:24:28,444 --> 00:24:30,321
My God, it's beautiful.

393
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:37,921
lt's a lovely feeling rolling along
in the open air,

394
00:24:38,004 --> 00:24:40,564
especially when you get
to the top of these hills

395
00:24:40,644 --> 00:24:44,876
and you go over the top and it dips.
You see it dipping and winding like that.

396
00:24:44,964 --> 00:24:48,354
It's an extraordinary rush.
It's a feeling of freedom.

397
00:24:48,444 --> 00:24:51,436
It's a lovely feeling. You're free as a bird.

398
00:24:53,084 --> 00:24:56,474
The only thing to look out for
around here is moose.

399
00:24:56,564 --> 00:24:58,680
I mean, look at it, the big daft article.

400
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:02,803
It has no idea it's one of Canada's
biggest killers on the roads.

401
00:25:08,244 --> 00:25:11,361
Nice, eh?
Don't say l never take you anywhere.

402
00:25:12,084 --> 00:25:14,803
Look at that. Pleasant Bay.

403
00:25:14,884 --> 00:25:17,557
Strange little name,
but it kind of sums it up, really.

404
00:25:17,644 --> 00:25:20,602
This is at the very end of Nova Scotia,
Cape Breton,

405
00:25:20,684 --> 00:25:23,562
New Brunswick,
all that Acadian stuff we showed you.

406
00:25:23,644 --> 00:25:25,714
This is up towards the end of it.

407
00:25:25,804 --> 00:25:28,398
We're now going to Newfoundland. That way.

408
00:25:29,724 --> 00:25:33,956
Now I've never been to Newfoundland before,
but I've met many Newfies in my travels

409
00:25:34,044 --> 00:25:36,512
and I can't wait to meet some more.

410
00:25:41,404 --> 00:25:43,554
I'm on a journey to the edge of the world.

411
00:25:43,644 --> 00:25:45,874
I'm leaving Nova Scotia and I'm flying north

412
00:25:45,964 --> 00:25:48,922
to the island of Newfoundland
and St John's.

413
00:25:49,044 --> 00:25:52,957
It was here on this rocky shoreline that
some of the earliest European explorers

414
00:25:53,044 --> 00:25:56,161
from the 15th century set foot
in the New World.

415
00:26:01,924 --> 00:26:04,802
This is Cape Spear, not Cape Fear, mind you.

416
00:26:04,884 --> 00:26:06,237
Cape Spear.

417
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:11,837
And the main reason l'm here
is that this is the most easterly point

418
00:26:11,924 --> 00:26:13,277
of North America.

419
00:26:13,404 --> 00:26:17,238
The nicest thing about it is you can see that
this is how the explorers first saw it

420
00:26:17,324 --> 00:26:18,552
coming this way.

421
00:26:18,644 --> 00:26:20,839
John Cabot, 1 497.

422
00:26:20,924 --> 00:26:25,315
You must remember that
Christopher Columbus was 1 492.

423
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:29,199
He said the fish were so bountiful,
you don't even need a net, he says.

424
00:26:29,284 --> 00:26:32,082
You just throw a basket over the side
with a weight in it.

425
00:26:32,164 --> 00:26:36,077
And you can pull fish in.
And that brought thousands of people.

426
00:26:36,724 --> 00:26:40,000
Thousands to get the cod.

427
00:26:44,444 --> 00:26:47,800
For over 500 years,
fishing has been the lifeblood here.

428
00:26:47,884 --> 00:26:50,444
Generations of mainly
English and Irish immigrants

429
00:26:50,524 --> 00:26:53,641
give St John's a lively feel
that I instantly liked.

430
00:26:57,604 --> 00:27:00,641
I've headed down to the harbour
for a look-see.

431
00:27:01,804 --> 00:27:05,114
See, l've always liked docks since
l was a wee boy in Glasgow.

432
00:27:05,204 --> 00:27:07,798
They have a peculiar smell.
The smell of ropes,

433
00:27:07,884 --> 00:27:10,523
tar, wood, sawdust.

434
00:27:11,124 --> 00:27:14,878
ln Scotland you would get the smell
of whisky and wood together

435
00:27:14,964 --> 00:27:17,273
and it's a thing that appealed to me as a boy.

436
00:27:17,364 --> 00:27:20,879
lt always smelled of foreign places

437
00:27:20,964 --> 00:27:24,115
and leaving and going on a voyage
and being a man

438
00:27:24,204 --> 00:27:27,082
and growing up and all that kind of thing.

439
00:27:27,324 --> 00:27:29,440
The harbour here is
a shadow of what it used to be

440
00:27:29,524 --> 00:27:31,833
before the cod got fished into oblivion.

441
00:27:31,924 --> 00:27:33,482
MAN: They're usually bigger than that, eh?

442
00:27:33,564 --> 00:27:36,078
These days it's mainly crabs
and shelly creatures,

443
00:27:36,164 --> 00:27:39,156
and I wonder if their days are numbered, too.

444
00:27:41,684 --> 00:27:45,120
Look at this poor bugger.
This is what it's all about.

445
00:27:45,644 --> 00:27:49,159
Picking him out of the ocean.
Minding his own business.

446
00:27:49,724 --> 00:27:52,522

was ordered to hit the deck.

When I was a wee boy,
I learned that Saint Anthony

of things that you'd lost.

that if you don't like the weather,
just wait five minutes and it'll change.

00:35:54,524 --> 00:35:57,357
And l've had several good-hair days so far

598
00:35:57,964 --> 00:35:59,556
in this drizzle.

599
00:36:04,484 --> 00:36:08,523
The very first Europeans that made
a flying visit here 1,000 years ago

600
00:36:08,604 --> 00:36:10,003
were the Vikings.

601
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:13,315
Today, out-of-work fishermen make a living
dressed up as Vikings.

602
00:36:13,644 --> 00:36:17,273
They have made a heritage encounter
where none existed before.

603
00:36:17,364 --> 00:36:20,037
I'm looking for the tribe's chieftain.

604
00:36:22,044 --> 00:36:25,878
Nobody here. l guess they must
have buggered off to Greenland.

605
00:36:26,364 --> 00:36:27,399
(MAN LAUGHlNG)

606
00:36:27,484 --> 00:36:30,203
l can hear them in here,
there's raucous laughter.

607
00:36:30,324 --> 00:36:31,393
(KNOCKlNG)

608
00:36:31,484 --> 00:36:32,633
Hello!

609
00:36:33,004 --> 00:36:34,323
(MAN SHOUTlNG)

610
00:36:34,404 --> 00:36:37,680
l am Chieftain Bjorn the Beautiful.

611
00:36:38,444 --> 00:36:40,116
-BlLLY: Bjorn the Beautiful?
-Bjorn the Beautiful.

612
00:36:40,204 --> 00:36:41,193
BlLLY: (LAUGHlNG) That's all right.

613
00:36:41,284 --> 00:36:43,275
That's a good name, isn't it, eh?

614
00:36:43,364 --> 00:36:45,161
BlLLY: lt's amazingly cosy and nice in here,
isn't it?

615
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,313
BJORN: Yeah.

616
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:49,362
BJORN: Now, a lot of people compare it
to the black houses in Scotland.

617
00:36:49,444 --> 00:36:50,923
They probably copied us, the Vikings.

618
00:36:51,004 --> 00:36:53,313
-They probably copied the Scots.
-Ah, no, no, no.

619
00:36:53,404 --> 00:36:54,439
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

620
00:36:54,524 --> 00:36:58,278
l think the Scots were lucky to actually
have the Norsemen.

621
00:36:59,724 --> 00:37:02,033
They talk a good game, the Vikings.

622
00:37:02,124 --> 00:37:04,240
BJORN: What do you mean,
''talk a good game''?

623
00:37:05,044 --> 00:37:06,318
(BJORN LAUGHlNG)

624
00:37:06,404 --> 00:37:09,362
BlLLY: l would love to live in a house
that was covered in flowers like that.

625
00:37:09,444 --> 00:37:12,083
Like being an old hippy from way back.

626
00:37:12,164 --> 00:37:13,677
They found this among the ruins.

627
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:16,119
-That's why we're posing for pictures.
-Well-preserved as it was.

628
00:37:16,204 --> 00:37:18,718
Absolutely, it was preserved exactly like that.

629
00:37:18,804 --> 00:37:21,398
-Remarkable.
-lt was wrapped in rushes and moss.

630
00:37:22,404 --> 00:37:25,202
BlLLY: Dressing up as Vikings
might seem an odd job,

631
00:37:25,324 --> 00:37:27,963
but at least Bjorn and his tribe
can carry on living here,

632
00:37:28,044 --> 00:37:30,399
while other out-of-work fishermen
have had to leave Newfoundland

633
00:37:30,484 --> 00:37:31,963
to find work.

634
00:37:33,324 --> 00:37:35,838
Tourism for here has been the lifeblood.

635
00:37:35,924 --> 00:37:38,836
-Yeah.
-Because, after the fishery died, that was it.

636
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:40,994
BlLLY: Yes.
BJORN: So, tourism has kept

637
00:37:41,084 --> 00:37:44,838
a degree of people here.
Not like it was, but a degree.

638
00:37:45,404 --> 00:37:48,919
Newfoundlanders have a bit of a habit,
where, if you can't make it here,

639
00:37:49,004 --> 00:37:50,596
-you go somewhere else.
-Yes.

640
00:37:50,684 --> 00:37:52,322
-And...
-Well, that's how they got here

641
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:53,439
-in the first place, isn't it?
-Yeah.

642
00:37:55,444 --> 00:38:00,154
BlLLY: People like to be Vikings. People like
the picturesque side of that kind of stuff.

643
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:02,280
And now the whole economy...

644
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:05,197
lt seems to me, half the signs here
are to Norseland

645
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:08,515
and Viking ships on the signs and all that.

646
00:38:08,604 --> 00:38:10,879
And the guys were here for about five years.

647
00:38:10,964 --> 00:38:13,398
It really is a blip on the screen.

648
00:38:14,764 --> 00:38:17,119
l think it's brilliant. Roll on.

649
00:38:17,644 --> 00:38:20,875
Keep up the bed and breakfast
and the Viking image.

650
00:38:20,964 --> 00:38:23,239
lt's better than anything l can think of.

651
00:38:23,404 --> 00:38:27,761
-All right, thank you. Take care.
-See you later, Bjorn. Stay beautiful.

652
00:38:28,284 --> 00:38:31,720
I'm off to get up close and personal
with an iceberg.

653
00:38:37,724 --> 00:38:38,918
Pilot.

654
00:38:40,124 --> 00:38:41,921
You're lucky people.

655
00:38:46,404 --> 00:38:48,599
lceberg Alley, here we come.

656
00:38:50,764 --> 00:38:53,836
Now, I've sat up front with pilots before,

657
00:38:53,924 --> 00:38:58,520
but it's a first for me to be allowed to
have a go at actually flying the plane.

658
00:38:58,724 --> 00:39:00,237
It's something I've always wanted to do.

659
00:39:00,324 --> 00:39:02,758
And, oh, my heart sings a wee song.

660
00:39:06,084 --> 00:39:08,644
I've spotted a handsome-looking iceberg
trapped in a bay,

661
00:39:08,724 --> 00:39:10,999
so it's time to get back on the water.

662
00:39:13,324 --> 00:39:16,122
-Okay, welcome aboard.
-Thanks very much.

663
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:17,719
Thank you very much.

664
00:39:18,964 --> 00:39:22,001
This guy, he's a local man.
His name's Freeman,

665
00:39:22,364 --> 00:39:26,039
and he's taking us round to the bay
where the iceberg is.

666
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:29,362
lt's like a big piece of jewellery
floating along.

667
00:39:29,444 --> 00:39:31,594
l think they're wonderful things.

668
00:39:31,684 --> 00:39:34,915
You'll like it, or l'll know the reason why.

669
00:39:37,324 --> 00:39:39,394
lt's a sensational colour.

670
00:39:39,804 --> 00:39:44,161
Even l, just spotting it peeping round
the corner there, got a wee thrill.

671
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,635
lsn't it a sensation?

672
00:39:53,244 --> 00:39:55,997
lt's come from the glacier in Greenland.

673
00:39:56,084 --> 00:39:59,997
That's the same place that produced
the icebergs that sunk the Titanic.

674
00:40:02,524 --> 00:40:04,640
The native Inuit, who live in Arctic Canada,

675
00:40:04,724 --> 00:40:07,796
believe that icebergs contain the spirits
of their ancestors

676
00:40:07,884 --> 00:40:10,159
who come back to see them every spring.

677
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:11,882
I love that.

678
00:40:13,884 --> 00:40:17,797
l just saw a face.
That's the nose on the left there.

679
00:40:17,884 --> 00:40:21,843
The upper lip, see it?
And then up, and there's hair at the back.

680
00:40:22,524 --> 00:40:24,992
See, that's the way they get you.

681
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:31,514
l'd love to tow it up the Clyde or up
the Thames or the Tyne or the Mersey

682
00:40:31,604 --> 00:40:33,913
and let all those kids see it.

683
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:37,921
For some peculiar reason,
it looks edible as well.

684
00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:41,240
lt looks like a big cake.

685
00:40:42,204 --> 00:40:45,401
lt's a meringue, that's what it is. You want it?

686
00:40:46,524 --> 00:40:48,435
We'll tow it back for you.

687
00:40:50,044 --> 00:40:53,320
This is just a taster of the frozen north
that's ahead of me.

688
00:40:53,404 --> 00:40:56,123
I'm almost at the end of this part
of my journey.

689
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:58,434
From here,
I'll be travelling beyond the Arctic Circle,

690
00:40:58,524 --> 00:41:02,358
but before that, there's something
I'd love to catch sight of.

691
00:41:05,724 --> 00:41:10,400
I'm going to the Quirpon Lighthouse,
which is only about half an hour away.

692
00:41:10,764 --> 00:41:13,597
But it's the most northerly bit
of Newfoundland.

693
00:41:13,884 --> 00:41:16,398
And it's famous for whale-spotting.

694
00:41:16,844 --> 00:41:19,722
As soon as you say,
''lt's famous for whale-spotting,''

695
00:41:19,804 --> 00:41:22,238
you get the feeling that
all the whales go, ''Right...''

696
00:41:22,684 --> 00:41:24,197
and dive.

697
00:41:25,404 --> 00:41:28,840
Some people are good
at spotting them spouting.

698
00:41:28,924 --> 00:41:31,961
l would have been a lousy whaler.

699
00:41:32,044 --> 00:41:35,195
l don't see it till half the tail is
flapping over my boat.

700
00:41:35,844 --> 00:41:39,678
# Oh, for the life of the rolling seas #

701
00:41:41,004 --> 00:41:42,915
Whoa!

702
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:49,877
Suddenly the full Newfoundland breakfast
isn't such a good idea.

703
00:41:53,684 --> 00:41:56,152
More scrambled eggs for me, please.

704
00:41:56,244 --> 00:41:59,395
Nurse, the screens. Nurse!

705
00:42:00,764 --> 00:42:02,197
Oh, nurse!

706
00:42:03,084 --> 00:42:05,552
No more black pudding for me!

707
00:42:09,324 --> 00:42:11,838
Apparently there's a whale up ahead.

708
00:42:14,484 --> 00:42:18,602
Oh, l saw it blowing there.
l'm going to shout ''There she blows,''

709
00:42:18,684 --> 00:42:20,834
the next time it happens.

710
00:42:21,124 --> 00:42:23,274
lt's always nice, isn't it,

711
00:42:23,964 --> 00:42:26,956
to see a whale? lt's always such a privilege.

712
00:42:27,964 --> 00:42:30,637
MAN: Tail's coming, there it is. Look.

713
00:42:31,604 --> 00:42:33,674
BlLLY: Oh! l saw it there.

714
00:42:34,284 --> 00:42:36,752
That was just amazing.

715
00:42:39,404 --> 00:42:42,202
Now, this is what I call
getting away from it all.

716
00:42:42,284 --> 00:42:47,039
I'm going to spend my last night in the most
remote lighthouse in Newfoundland.

717
00:42:47,564 --> 00:42:50,920
l ordered a white stretch limo with colour TV.

718
00:42:51,804 --> 00:42:53,442
Didn't show up.

719
00:42:54,924 --> 00:42:58,041
l've been booked into some weird places
in my time.

720
00:42:58,364 --> 00:42:59,479
This takes the biscuit.

721
00:42:59,564 --> 00:43:00,633
WOMAN: Hello!

722
00:43:00,724 --> 00:43:02,282
-BlLLY: Hello!
-Welcome to the island.

723
00:43:02,364 --> 00:43:04,320
Thank you very, very much indeed.

724
00:43:04,404 --> 00:43:06,793
l never entered a hotel quite like that
in my life.

725
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:07,873
Okay.

726
00:43:08,324 --> 00:43:10,758
Do people usually look as amazed as l do?

727
00:43:11,724 --> 00:43:13,123
WOMAN: l don't know.

728
00:43:27,924 --> 00:43:30,882
We're at the very northern tip
of Newfoundland.

729
00:43:30,964 --> 00:43:34,400
From here, we're going north and west.

730
00:43:35,644 --> 00:43:37,874
And it just seems like
the most extraordinary journey.

731
00:43:37,964 --> 00:43:39,955
We've hardly started yet.

732
00:43:41,484 --> 00:43:44,078
When you think of everything
we've done together,

733
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:47,361
we've seen fantastic scenery
in this immense country.

734
00:43:47,444 --> 00:43:49,435
There was Pier 21,

735
00:43:49,524 --> 00:43:51,799
fishing at sea with Bobby and Ralph,

736
00:43:51,884 --> 00:43:54,352
the stirring massed bands
at the Highland Games,

737
00:43:54,444 --> 00:43:57,595
the delightful Chester
and his bizarre scarecrows,

738
00:43:57,684 --> 00:44:00,642
having a laugh with Dave
on the River Gander.

739
00:44:01,044 --> 00:44:02,397
Welcome to Newfoundland, my son.

740
00:44:02,484 --> 00:44:06,716
Ordinary folk, generous, warm people
just getting on with their lives,

741
00:44:06,804 --> 00:44:11,480
but clinging on nostalgically to a world
that seems to be slipping away from them.

742
00:44:11,564 --> 00:44:15,523
What will I find as I head for a land
where the going gets really tough?

743
00:44:15,604 --> 00:44:19,756
How are the people up there coping
as the world changes around them?

744
00:44:21,364 --> 00:44:25,118
From here, we're going that way.

745
00:44:26,404 --> 00:44:29,714
Into the wilderness, up to Baffin Island.

746
00:44:31,244 --> 00:44:34,600
If you're stuck for where Baffin Island is,
get yourself a map.

747
00:44:34,684 --> 00:44:37,835
It's slightly left
and a wee bit below Greenland.

748
00:44:38,324 --> 00:44:42,681
The people look different, sound different,
