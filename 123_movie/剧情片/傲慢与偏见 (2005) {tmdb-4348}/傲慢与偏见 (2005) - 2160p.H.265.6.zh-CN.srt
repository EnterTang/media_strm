00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,876
欢迎来到栖目See Movie私人影院

2
00:00:34,918 --> 00:00:44,303


3
00:01:04,114 --> 00:01:12,414
片名：傲慢与偏见

4
00:01:12,414 --> 00:01:13,414


5
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:13,892
丽迪雅！吉蒂！
Lydia! Kitty!

6
00:02:50,387 --> 00:02:53,181
我的好老爷班纳特，你听说了吗？
My dear Mr Bennet, have you heard?

7
00:02:53,348 --> 00:02:55,268
尼日斐花园终于租出去了
Netherfield Park is let at last.

8
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:58,061
你难道不想知道是谁租去了吗?
Do you not want to know who has taken it?

9
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:01,873
既然你这么想告诉我  我的好太太
As you wish to tell me, my dear,

10
00:03:01,874 --> 00:03:04,276
我只能洗耳恭听了
I doubt I have any choice in the matter.

11
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,160
吉蒂  我不是跟你说过吗  不要偷听
Kitty, what have I told you about listening at the door?

12
00:03:13,368 --> 00:03:16,163
是位从北部来的彬格莱先生
There's a Mr Bingley arrived from the North.

13
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,583
- 一年有五千磅的收入！  - 真的？
- Five thousand a year!  - Really?

14
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,376
- 他是单身汉！  - 谁是单身汉？
- He's single!  - Who's single?

15
00:03:21,585 --> 00:03:24,254
显然是彬格莱先生。吉蒂！
A Mr Bingley, apparently. Kitty!

16
00:03:24,421 --> 00:03:26,298
这关女儿们什么事？
How can that possibly affect them?

17
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,633
班纳特老爷，你怎么这么讨厌？
Mr Bennet, how can you be so tiresome?

18
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,178
告诉你吧，他一定会娶我们女儿中的一个当太太
You know he must marry one of them.

19
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,388
他住到这儿来就是为了这个？
That is his design in settling here?

20
00:03:33,597 --> 00:03:35,807
你得马上去拜访拜访他
You must go and visit him at once.

21
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:38,935
天哪，人啊
Good heavens. People.

22
00:03:41,396 --> 00:03:45,484
要是你不去，叫我们怎么去？你是知道的，班纳特
For we may not visit if you do not, as you well know, Mr Bennet.

23
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,019
你在听我说话吗？你从来都不听
Are you listening? You never listen.

24
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,863
你一定要去，爸爸！马上！
You must, Papa! At once!

25
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,574
没必要，我已经去过了
There's no need. I already have.

26
00:03:53,325 --> 00:03:55,202
- 你去过了？  - 什么时候？
- You have?  - When?

27
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:58,955
噢，班纳特老爷，你怎么能够这样戏弄我？
Oh, Mr Bennet, how can you tease me so?

28
00:03:59,164 --> 00:04:01,541
你就不能体谅体谅我那脆弱的神经吗?
Have you no compassion for my poor nerves?

29
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,337
你错怪我了，我的好太太。我非常尊重你的神经
You mistake me, my dear. I have the highest respect for them.

30
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:08,798
它们是我20多年的老朋友了
They've been my constant companions these twenty years.

31
00:04:08,965 --> 00:04:09,966
爸爸！
Papa!

32
00:04:10,175 --> 00:04:11,426
- 他亲切吗？  - 谁？
- Is he amiable?  - Who?

33
00:04:11,593 --> 00:04:13,970
- 他帅吗？  - 那是当然
- Is he handsome?  - He's sure to be.

34
00:04:14,179 --> 00:04:17,349
一年有五千镑的人，就算有什么毛病也没关系啦
With 5,000 a year, it would not matter if he had warts.

35
00:04:17,516 --> 00:04:18,892
谁有毛病？
Who's got warts?

36
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:22,312
我倒想看看他会娶什么样的女孩
I will consent to his marrying whichever girl he chooses.

37
00:04:22,521 --> 00:04:26,733
- 那么他明天也会去舞会吗？  - 我想是的
- So will he come to the ball tomorrow?  - I believe so.

38
00:04:27,984 --> 00:04:31,821
- 班纳特老爷！  - 我要穿你的棉布衣了！
- Mr Bennet!  - I have to have your muslin!

39
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:33,803
我会把我的绿拖鞋借给你！
I'll lend you my green slippers!

40
00:04:33,804 --> 00:04:34,824
那本来就是我的
They were mine.

41
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:36,928
我会帮你做一星期的针线活
I'll do your mending for a week.

42
00:04:36,929 --> 00:04:38,745
我会帮你重新装饰你的新帽子
I'll retrim your new bonnet.

43
00:04:38,954 --> 00:04:40,664
那我就帮你做两星期
Two weeks I'll do it for.

44
00:05:19,077 --> 00:05:22,247
不一样！不一样
It's not the same! It's not the same.

45
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,301
我快喘不过气了
I can't breathe.

46
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:39,848
我连脚趾头都差点给踩掉了
I think one of my toes just came off.

47
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,984
全场男士要是有人没在今晚爱上你
If every man does not end the evening in love with you,

48
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,944
那我对美丽就没什么好评价的了
then I'm no judge of beauty.

49
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:54,954
或者对男士们没什么好评价的了
Or men.

50
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,156
不  要评价他们太容易了
No, they are far too easy to judge.

51
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,866
他们并不都那么糟糕
They're not all bad.

52
00:05:58,033 --> 00:06:00,910
以我有限的经历  他们说的都是一本正经的废话
Humourless poppycocks, in my limited experience.

53
00:06:01,077 --> 00:06:03,371
总有一天，有人入了你的法眼
One day, someone will catch your eye,

54
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,957
到时候你就不会这么口无遮拦了
and then you'll have to watch your tongue.

55
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:28,438
你能来真是太好了
How good of you to come.

56
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:31,274
哪一位鲜艳的孔雀是我们的彬格莱先生？
Which of the painted peacocks is our Mr Bingley?

57
00:06:31,441 --> 00:06:34,194
右边的是他，左边的是他的妹妹
He's on the right. On the left is his sister.

58
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,796
长着奇怪眉毛的那个？
The person with the quizzical brow?

59
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:39,407
那个是他的好朋友达西先生
That is his good friend, Mr Darcy.

60
00:06:39,616 --> 00:06:42,097
他看上去挺痛苦的，可怜的人
He looks miserable, poor soul.

61
00:06:42,098 --> 00:06:43,995
他可能痛苦，但并不可怜
He may be, but poor he is not.

62
00:06:44,162 --> 00:06:45,163
说来听听
Tell me.

63
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,124
一年有一万英镑的收入他拥有半个的德贝郡
10000 a year, and he owns half of Derbyshire.

64
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,335
这痛苦的半个德贝郡
The miserable half.

65
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:22,617
班纳特老爷，你一定要马上把他介绍给你的女儿们
Mr Bennet, you must introduce him to the girls immediately.

66
00:07:23,535 --> 00:07:25,328
朝彬格莱先生微笑，微笑
Smile at Mr Bingley. Smile.

67
00:07:41,886 --> 00:07:42,887
曼丽
Mary.

68
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:46,015
彬格莱先生，我的长女，你已经认识
Mr Bingley, my eldest daughter you know.

69
00:07:47,141 --> 00:07:49,372
班纳特太太，吉英·班纳特小姐
Mrs Bennet, Miss Jane Bennet,

70
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:51,604
伊丽莎白还有曼丽·班纳特小姐
Elizabeth and Miss Mary Bennet.

71
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,214
很荣幸见到你们
It is a pleasure.

72
00:07:53,215 --> 00:07:55,525
我还有两个女儿，不过她们在跳舞
I have two others, but they're already dancing.

73
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:58,069
我很高兴能与你们相识
I'm delighted to make your acquaintance.

74
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:00,926
请允许我向你们介绍达西先生
And may I introduce Mr Darcy

75
00:08:00,927 --> 00:08:03,575
他来自德贝郡的彭伯里庄园
of Pemberley in Derbyshire.

76
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:25,430
你喜欢赫特福德郡吗？
How do you like it here in Hertfordshire?

77
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,598
很喜欢
Very much.

78
00:08:27,765 --> 00:08:31,102
尼日斐的图书馆  我听说是最好的图书馆之一
The library at Netherfield, I've heard, is one of the finest.

79
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:34,409
这真让我深感惭愧，我不是一个好的读者
It fills me with guilt. I'm not a good reader.

80
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:35,732
我更喜欢户外运动
 I prefer being out of doors.

81
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,484
噢，我是说，我能读书，当然
Oh, I mean, I can read, of course.

82
00:08:38,693 --> 00:08:42,113
我可不建议你在户外读书哦
And I'm not suggesting you can't read out of doors.

83
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,868
我非常希望我能多读点书
I wish I read more,

84
00:08:43,869 --> 00:08:46,034
但是总有这样那样的事情要做
but there seem to be so many other things to do.

85
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,494
对，我就是这个意思
That's exactly what I meant.

86
00:08:51,622 --> 00:08:55,543
妈妈，妈妈！你肯定不会相信我们要说的事
Mama, Mama! You will never, ever believe what we're about to tell you.

87
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,338
- 说啊！  - 她一定会掩饰
- Tell me!  - She's going to take the veil.

88
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,882
- 军团要来了！  - 军官们？
- The regiment are coming!  - Officers?

89
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:04,302
他们整个冬天将驻扎在这里，就在这里哦！
They're going to be stationed the whole winter, right here.

90
00:09:04,469 --> 00:09:07,013
- 军官们?  - 长期驻扎哦
- Officers?  - As far as the eye can see.

91
00:09:13,478 --> 00:09:17,398
噢，瞧，吉英在和彬格莱先生在跳舞
Oh, look. Jane's dancing with Mr Bingley.

92
00:09:17,565 --> 00:09:19,067
班纳特老爷
Mr Bennet.

93
00:09:33,247 --> 00:09:35,035
你想跳舞吗，达西先生?
Do you dance, Mr Darcy?

94
00:09:35,036 --> 00:09:37,335
不想，不过如果你想跳的话我可以奉陪
Not if I can help it.

95
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:59,315
我不知道你会来这看我，出什么事了?
I didn't know you were coming to see me. What's the matter?

96
00:09:59,524 --> 00:10:04,014
我们从罗夫纳酒店千里迢迢赶来的就为这?
We are a long way from Grosvenor Square, are we not,

97
00:10:04,015 --> 00:10:05,196
达西先生?
Mr Darcy?

98
00:10:05,363 --> 00:10:07,573
我生平没见过今天晚上这么多可爱的姑娘们
I've never seen so many pretty girls.

99
00:10:07,782 --> 00:10:10,243
舞场上唯一的美女在跟你跳舞
You were dancing with the only handsome girl.

100
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,412
她是我这辈子见过的最美丽的尤物
She is the most beautiful creature I have ever beheld.

101
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:16,948
不过她妹妹伊丽莎白也很讨人喜欢啊
But her sister Elizabeth is agreeable.

102
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:17,959
她长得还行
Perfectly tolerable.

103
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,843
不过也没漂亮到让我动心的地步
Not handsome enough to tempt me.

104
00:10:19,844 --> 00:10:22,421
你还是回到你的舞伴身边去欣赏她的笑脸吧
Return to your partner and enjoy her smiles.

105
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:25,049
犯不着把时间浪费在我的身上
You're wasting your time with me.

106
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:30,892
往好的一面想  伊丽莎白
Count your blessings, Lizzie.

107
00:10:30,893 --> 00:10:33,558
他要是喜欢你  你就得和他聊天啦
If he liked you, you'd have to talk to him.

108
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,017
说得是
Precisely.

109
00:10:35,226 --> 00:10:37,937
就算他拥有整个德贝郡  我也不愿意和他跳舞
I wouldn't dance with him for all of Derbyshire,

110
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,481
何况他只拥有半个而已
Iet alone the miserable half.

111
00:11:43,127 --> 00:11:44,587
等等！
Wait!

112
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,557
我很喜欢这里，卢卡斯小姐
I enjoyed that so much, Miss Lucas.

113
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:07,026
你跳得真好，彬格莱先生
How well you dance, Mr Bingley.

114
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,487
我从没跳得这么尽兴
I've never enjoyed a dance so much.

115
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:12,531
我女儿吉英的舞跳得很不错，对吧？
My daughter Jane is a splendid dancer, is she not?

116
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,658
她确实跳得很好
She is indeed.

117
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:18,871
你的朋友卢卡斯小姐，是个非常风趣的年轻女士
Your friend Miss Lucas is a most amusing young woman.

118
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,748
噢，是啊，我可喜欢她了
Oh, yes, I adore her.

119
00:12:20,915 --> 00:12:25,086
- 可惜的是她不够漂亮  - 妈妈！
- It is a pity she's not more handsome.  - Mama!

120
00:12:25,252 --> 00:12:28,756
噢，但是伊丽莎白绝不会承认她相貌平平
Oh, but Lizzie would never admit that she's plain.

121
00:12:28,923 --> 00:12:33,177
当然啦，我的吉英才是这个郡最漂亮的可人儿
Of course, it's my Jane who's considered the beauty of the county.

122
00:12:33,344 --> 00:12:34,345
妈妈，求求你！
Mama, please!

123
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:37,640
她15岁那年，就有位绅士深深地爱上了她
When she was 15, a gentleman was so much in love with her,

124
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:40,017
我敢肯定他会向她求婚
I was sure he would make her an offer.

125
00:12:40,184 --> 00:12:43,771
无论如何，他是写过不少可爱的诗给她
However, he did write her some very pretty verses.

126
00:12:43,938 --> 00:12:45,189
不过也就到此为止了
And that put paid to it.

127
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:48,776
我真惊讶，是谁发现了诗还有熄灭爱情的力量
I wonder who discovered the power of poetry in driving away love.

128
00:12:48,984 --> 00:12:50,852
我还以为诗能滋养爱情呢
I thought poetry was the food of love.

129
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,321
对坚定的爱情确实如此
Of a fine, stout love.

130
00:12:52,488 --> 00:12:53,970
但是如果只是暧昧的喜好
But if it is only a vague inclination,

131
00:12:53,971 --> 00:12:55,991
一首蹩脚的十四行诗就能轻易毁了它
one poor sonnet will kill it.

132
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,203
那么，你推荐用什么来激发爱情呢？
So, what do you recommend to encourage affection?

133
00:13:00,162 --> 00:13:06,168
跳舞。即使舞伴长得也就是还行而已
Dancing. Even if one's partner is barely tolerable.

134
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:32,111
彬格莱先生真是位典型的好青年
Mr Bingley is just what a young man ought to be.

135
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,099
有见识，有趣味..
Sensible, good-humoured...

136
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,781
英俊，非常富有...
Handsome, conveniently rich...

137
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,784
婚姻不应该以金钱为出发点
Marriage should not be driven by thoughts of money.

138
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,161
我只会为真挚的爱而结婚
Only deep love will persuade me to marry.

139
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,924
所以我势必成为一位老姑娘
Which is why I'll end up an old maid.

140
00:13:43,925 --> 00:13:46,000
你真的认为他喜欢我吗？
Do you really believe he liked me?

141
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,542
他几乎整晚都在和你跳舞
He danced with you most of the night,

142
00:13:47,543 --> 00:13:49,670
没跳的时候，眼睛也一刻不离开你
and stared at you the rest.

143
00:13:49,837 --> 00:13:52,840
我不反对你喜欢他。反正你以前也喜欢过不少蠢货
I give you leave to like him. You've liked many stupider.

144
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:56,302
你也太容易对人产生好感了
You're a great deal too apt to like people in general.

145
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:58,429
在你眼里，天下都是好人
All the world is good in your eyes.

146
00:13:58,637 --> 00:13:59,682
他的朋友可不算好人
Not his friend.

147
00:13:59,683 --> 00:14:01,891
我到现在都不敢相信他居然那么说你
I still can't believe what he said about you.

148
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:04,476
达西先生？
Mr Darcy?

149
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:06,753
要不是他伤了我的虚荣心
I'd more easily forgive his vanity

150
00:14:06,754 --> 00:14:09,440
我对他的虚荣倒还蛮理解的
had he not wounded mine.

151
00:14:09,607 --> 00:14:12,401
不过不用担心，恐怕我们再也不会交谈了
But no matter. I doubt we shall ever speak again.

152
00:14:43,932 --> 00:14:46,060
他和卢卡斯小姐跳舞了
He danced with Miss Lucas.

153
00:14:46,226 --> 00:14:48,103
我们都在那看到了，我的好太太
We were all there, dear.

154
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,397
真可惜她不够漂亮
It is a shame she's not more handsome.

155
00:14:50,564 --> 00:14:53,317
看来她注定要成为老处女了
There's a spinster in the making and no mistake.

156
00:14:53,484 --> 00:14:56,153
第四支舞是和金小姐跳的
The fourth with a Miss King of little standing,

157
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,447
第五支又是跟吉英跳的
and the fifth again with Jane.

158
00:14:58,656 --> 00:15:01,909
要是他稍许体谅我一点，他真该把脚给扭了才好
If he had any compassion, he would've sprained his ankle.

159
00:15:02,076 --> 00:15:03,243
你说得倒轻巧
The way you carry on,

160
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:06,497
也不想想，我们女儿只能指望继承一千镑的遗产
you'd think our girls look forward to a grand inheritance.

161
00:15:06,663 --> 00:15:08,957
你去世之时，这可是说来就来的事儿
When you die, which may be very soon,

162
00:15:09,124 --> 00:15:11,245
到时候他们不会给我们留一片瓦
they will be left without a roof over their head

163
00:15:11,246 --> 00:15:13,670
他们会拿走他们名下的每个子儿
nor a penny to their name.

164
00:15:13,837 --> 00:15:15,696
拜托，现在才早上十点
Please, it's ten in the morning.

165
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:17,424
给班纳特小姐的信，夫人
A letter to Miss Bennet, ma'am.

166
00:15:17,591 --> 00:15:21,095
从尼日斐庄园寄出的
From Netherfield Hall.

167
00:15:21,303 --> 00:15:24,973
赞美上帝，我们有救了！
Praise the Lord. We are saved!

168
00:15:25,182 --> 00:15:30,145
快，吉英，快，噢，多么愉快的一天啊！
Make haste, Jane, make haste. Oh, happy day!

169
00:15:31,647 --> 00:15:34,191
卡罗琳·彬格莱写来的
It is from Caroline Bingley.

170
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:39,113
她邀请我和她共进晚餐
She has invited me to dine with her.

171
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,366
- 她哥哥要出去吃饭  - 出去吃饭？
- Her brother will be dining out.  - Dining out?

172
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:44,493
- 我能用马车吗？  - 我想想
- Can I take the carriage?  - Let me see.

173
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:46,775
那太远了走不过去的
It is too far to walk.

174
00:15:46,776 --> 00:15:48,372
他没道理这么做呀
This is unaccountable of him.

175
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,457
妈妈，为吉英准备马车？
Mama, the carriage for Jane?

176
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:56,171
当然不，她要骑马去
Certainly not. She'll go on horseback.

177
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:59,216
骑马！
Horseback!

178
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:16,400
伊丽莎白
Lizzie.

179
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:19,945
这下她得在那留宿了，不出我所料
Now she'll have to stay the night, exactly as I predicted.

180
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:23,282
天哪，老婆子，你做媒的技巧
Good grief, woman, your skills in the art of matchmaking

181
00:16:23,448 --> 00:16:25,325
简直出神入化
are positively occult.

182
00:16:25,492 --> 00:16:30,122
不过，妈妈，你连呼风唤雨也会啊
Though I don't think, Mama, you can take credit for making it rain.

183
00:16:35,002 --> 00:16:38,505
“除非我好了些，不然朋友们不会让我回家
"My friends will not hear of me returning home until I am better.

184
00:16:38,672 --> 00:16:42,759
除了喉咙发炎、发烧、头痛，我都挺好的”
Excepting a sore throat, a fever and a headache, nothing is wrong with me."

185
00:16:42,926 --> 00:16:44,348
吉英要是因此送了命
If Jane does die it

186
00:16:44,349 --> 00:16:48,140
知道她这是听你的话去追彬格莱，也算是个安慰
will be a comfort to know it was in pursuit of Mr Bingley.

187
00:16:48,348 --> 00:16:50,642
哪有小感冒就送命的道理
People do not die of colds.

188
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:54,229
但她会因为有这么一个母亲而羞愧死
But she may perish with the shame of having such a mother.

189
00:16:55,355 --> 00:16:58,108
我必须立刻去尼日斐
I must go to Netherfield at once.

190
00:17:11,204 --> 00:17:16,251
巴瑟斯特夫人正在按照法国风格重新装修舞厅
Lady Bathurst is redecorating her ballroom in the French style.

191
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,630
有点不爱国，你不觉得吗？
A little unpatriotic, don't you think?

192
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:25,093
伊丽莎白·班纳特小姐到
Miss Elizabeth Bennet.

193
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,026
天哪，你是走着来的吗？
Good Lord, did you walk here?

194
00:17:41,777 --> 00:17:43,236
是的
I did.

195
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:53,602
真抱歉打扰了，我姐姐怎么样了？
I'm so sorry. How is my sister?

196
00:17:53,603 --> 00:17:54,623
她在楼上
She's upstairs.

197
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,794
谢谢
Thank you.

198
00:18:08,303 --> 00:18:13,183
天哪，你看到她的裙摆没？足足有6英寸的泥浆
My goodness, did you see her hem? Six inches deep in mud.

199
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,519
她看上去像从中世纪来的
She looked positively mediaeval.

200
00:18:15,686 --> 00:18:20,232
我觉得很不好意思，他们对我都非常好
I feel such a terrible imposition. They're being so kind to me.

201
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:23,193
不知道他俩谁更高兴看到你在这
I don't know who is more pleased at your being here,

202
00:18:23,194 --> 00:18:25,987
是妈妈还是彬格莱先生呢？
Mama or Mr Bingley.

203
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,620
谢谢你们对我姐姐的精心照顾
Thank you for tending to my sister so diligently.

204
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:36,123
她在这比在家要舒服多了
She's in far better comfort than at home.

205
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:37,999
乐意之至
It's a pleasure.

206
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:42,045
我不是说我乐意她生病，当然不是
I mean, it's not a pleasure that she's ill. Of course not.

207
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:46,091
我乐意的是她在这生病了
It's a pleasure that she's here, being ill.

208
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,555
人怕出名猪怕壮啊
Not going to be famous, our pig.

209
00:18:51,721 --> 00:18:55,058
后背是黑色，但是和诺里奇的猪没任何关系
Black on the back, but not related to the learned pig of Norwich.

210
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:58,353
- 现在那猪...  - 班纳特老爷
- Now that pig is...  - Mr Bennet.

211
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,857
计划进行得一帆风顺  他已经几乎爱上她了
It's all going to plan. He's half in love with her already.

212
00:19:02,065 --> 00:19:04,276
- 谁，布洛申？  - 彬格先莱生
- Who is, blossom?  - Mr Bingley.

213
00:19:04,484 --> 00:19:06,778
他不在乎她一文不名
He doesn't mind that she hasn't a penny.

214
00:19:06,987 --> 00:19:09,197
他的钱足够他们俩用的
He has more than enough for the two of them.

215
00:19:09,406 --> 00:19:11,366
- 我们怎么结识他们？  - 好办！
- How will we meet them?  - Easy!

216
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:12,617
等等我！
Wait for me!

217
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:15,703
你把东西掉在地上，他们帮你拾起来
You drop something. They pick it up.

218
00:19:15,704 --> 00:19:18,206
这样自然就认识了
And then you're introduced.

219
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:26,923
军官！
Officers!

220
00:19:59,206 --> 00:20:02,542
你写信写得出奇的快啊，达西先生
You write uncommonly fast, Mr Darcy.

221
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:04,794
你这话可说得不对，其实我写得相当慢
You're mistaken. I write slowly.

222
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:08,590
你得写多少封信啊，达西先生？
How many letters you must have occasion
to write, Mr Darcy.

223
00:20:08,757 --> 00:20:11,635
生意上的信  我想你一定很厌烦吧
Letters of business. How odious I should think them.

224
00:20:11,801 --> 00:20:14,679
幸亏得写这些信的人是我，而不是你
It is fortunate, then, they fall to me and not you.

225
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:17,390
告诉令妹，我很想和她见见面
Tell your sister I long to see her.

226
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:20,936
- 我已经遵命告诉过她了  - 我太喜爱她了
- I've already told her once.  - I do dote on her.

227
00:20:21,102 --> 00:20:23,444
她寄来给我装饰桌子的那张美丽的小图案
I was quite in raptures

228
00:20:23,445 --> 00:20:24,356
我喜欢极了
at her beautiful design for a table.

229
00:20:24,522 --> 00:20:25,419
可否请你通融一下
Perhaps you will give me leave

230
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,776
容我下次再代为转达？
to defer your raptures.

231
00:20:27,943 --> 00:20:30,070
这一次我可写不下这么多啦
I have not room enough to do them justice.

232
00:20:30,278 --> 00:20:33,114
你们这些年轻小姐真是多才多艺
You young ladies are so accomplished.

233
00:20:33,281 --> 00:20:34,741
你什么意思？
What do you mean?

234
00:20:34,742 --> 00:20:36,785
你们会为桌子作画，会弹钢琴
You paint tables, play the piano

235
00:20:36,952 --> 00:20:38,370
还能给垫子绣花
and embroider cushions.

236
00:20:38,536 --> 00:20:41,706
我还从没听说过哪位小姐不被称为多才多艺的
I never heard of a lady, but people say she's accomplished.

237
00:20:41,915 --> 00:20:44,125
这个词被过于滥用了
The word is applied too liberally.

238
00:20:44,334 --> 00:20:47,627
我认识的真正称得上多才多艺的女士不超过6个
I do not know more half a dozen women that are truly accomplished.

239
00:20:47,628 --> 00:20:49,422
我也是
Nor I.

240
00:20:49,589 --> 00:20:52,759
天哪，你对这个概念一定深有体会
Goodness, you must comprehend a great deal in the idea.

241
00:20:52,926 --> 00:20:54,552
- 是的  - 绝对
- I do.  - Absolutely.

242
00:20:54,761 --> 00:20:58,431
她必须通晓音乐、歌唱、绘画、跳舞
She must have a knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing

243
00:20:58,598 --> 00:21:01,935
以及现代语言，才称得上多才多艺
and the modern languages to deserve the word.

244
00:21:02,143 --> 00:21:05,980
还有言谈举止
And something in her air and manner of walking.

245
00:21:06,189 --> 00:21:09,067
她必须通过广泛的阅读来扩展自身视野
And she must improve her mind by extensive reading.

246
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:12,987
难怪你只认识6位多才多艺的女士了
I'm no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women.

247
00:21:13,154 --> 00:21:14,822
我甚至怀疑你一位都不认识
I wonder at you knowing any.

248
00:21:14,823 --> 00:21:16,491
你对同性的要求这么严格的吗？
Are you so severe on your own sex?

249
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,484
我从没见过这样的女士
I never saw such a woman.

250
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:21,162
这样的女士一定令人望而生畏
She would certainly be a fearsome thing to behold.

251
00:21:23,581 --> 00:21:27,085
伊丽莎白小姐，我们在房间里随便走走吧
Miss Elizabeth, let us take a turn about the room.

252
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,760
这很提神，不是吗
It's refreshing, is it not,

253
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:49,023
坐了那么久，走动一下可以提提精神
after sitting so long in one attitude?

254
00:21:49,232 --> 00:21:52,485
我想这也是种小技艺吧
It is a small kind of accomplishment, I suppose.

255
00:21:52,652 --> 00:21:54,863
你不和我们一起走走吗，达西先生？
Will you not join us, Mr Darcy?

256
00:21:55,071 --> 00:21:56,368
你们的动机不外乎两种
You can only have two motives,

257
00:21:56,369 --> 00:21:58,575
但我若是一起走的话就有碍于你们
and I would interfere with either.

258
00:21:58,783 --> 00:22:00,827
他这是什么意思？
What can he mean?

259
00:22:00,994 --> 00:22:04,247
要让他失望的话，最好就是什么也别问他
The surest way to disappoint him would be to ask him nothing.

260
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:07,208
一定要告诉我们，达西先生
Do tell us, Mr Darcy.

261
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,588
要么就是，你们俩是心腹之交
Either you are in each other's confidence

262
00:22:11,754 --> 00:22:13,882
有些私事要聊聊
and you have secret affairs to discuss,

263
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,301
要么就是你们自以为散起步来
or you are conscious that your figures

264
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:19,679
体态特别优美  所以要散散步
appear to the greatest advantage by walking.

265
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:22,256
倘若是出于第一个动机
If the first,

266
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,933
我夹在你们中间就会妨碍你们
I should get in your way.

267
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,181
倘若是出于第二个动机
If the second,

268
00:22:25,182 --> 00:22:27,020
那么我坐在这可以更好地欣赏你们
I can admire you much better from here.

269
00:22:27,187 --> 00:22:29,564
亏他说得出，我们该怎么罚他呀？
How shall we punish him for such a speech?

270
00:22:29,731 --> 00:22:31,131
我们可以取笑他一番
We could laugh at him.

271
00:22:31,132 --> 00:22:33,776
不行，达西先生是不能让人笑话的
No. Mr Darcy is not to be teased.

272
00:22:33,943 --> 00:22:36,456
你是否太骄傲了些，达西先生?
Are you too proud, Mr Darcy?

273
00:22:36,457 --> 00:22:38,656
你认为骄傲是缺点还是优点?
And would you consider pride a fault or a virtue?

274
00:22:38,823 --> 00:22:41,826
- 说不好  - 我们在试着找出你的缺点
- I couldn't say.  - We're trying to find a fault in you.

275
00:22:42,035 --> 00:22:44,092
别人的愚蠢和过错我本应该赶快忘掉
I find it hard to forgive

276
00:22:44,093 --> 00:22:45,121
却偏偏忘不掉
the follies and vices of others,

277
00:22:45,288 --> 00:22:47,081
人家得罪了我，我也忘不掉
or their offences against me.

278
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:50,793
我对人一旦失去了好感，就永远没有好感了
My good opinion, once lost, is lost forever.

279
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:55,924
噢，天哪，我不能取笑你了
Oh, dear. I cannot tease you about that.

280
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:58,218
真可惜，我很爱取笑人
What a shame, for I dearly love to laugh.

281
00:22:58,426 --> 00:23:00,637
我想是家族传统吧
A family trait, I think.

282
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:32,460
班纳特太太、班纳特三小姐、班纳特四小姐
A Mrs Bennet, a Miss Bennet, a Miss Bennet

283
00:23:32,461 --> 00:23:34,629
还有班纳特五小姐到，先生
and a Miss Bennet, sir.

284
00:23:34,796 --> 00:23:37,799
乡下所有叫班纳特的都来我们家了?
Are we to receive every Bennet in the country?

285
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:43,846
你的屋子多可爱啊，先生
What an excellent room you have, sir.

286
00:23:44,013 --> 00:23:47,684
家具都这么贵重
Such expensive furnishings.

287
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:50,853
我非常希望你能留在这，彬格莱先生
I do hope you intend to stay here, Mr Bingley.

288
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:55,858
当然，我觉得乡村非常的有趣。不是吗，达西？
Absolutely, I find the country very diverting. Don't you agree, Darcy?

289
00:23:56,025 --> 00:23:57,735
我觉得是够有趣的
I find it perfectly adequate.

290
00:23:57,944 --> 00:24:00,822
虽说乡下碰不到像城里那么多形形色色的人
Even if society is a little less varied than in town.

291
00:24:00,989 --> 00:24:02,865
碰不到? 没这回事
Less varied? Not at all.

292
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:05,321
就我所知，平常跟我们来往吃饭的
We dine with four and 20 families

293
00:24:05,322 --> 00:24:07,120
就有足足二十四家，各色各样
of all shapes and sizes.

294
00:24:07,286 --> 00:24:11,749
例如威廉·卢卡斯爵士就非常和蔼可亲
Sir William Lucas, for instance, is a very agreeable man.

295
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:15,712
比起某些爵位还不如他的人，他一点也不妄自尊大
And a good deal less self-important than some people half his rank.

296
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,590
彬格莱先生，你真的要在这举办舞会吗?
Mr Bingley, is it true you will hold a ball here?

297
00:24:19,757 --> 00:24:21,300
舞会?
A ball?

298
00:24:21,467 --> 00:24:26,180
那将是认识新朋友最好的方式，你可以邀请军人们
It would be an excellent way to meet new friends. You could invite the militia.

299
00:24:26,389 --> 00:24:28,349
- 噢，办个舞会吧！  - 吉蒂！
- Oh, do hold a ball!  - Kitty!

300
00:24:28,683 --> 00:24:31,394
等你姐姐复元了，由你随便定个日期就行
When your sister recovers, you shall name the day.

301
00:24:31,561 --> 00:24:36,107
我想通过舞会结识新交有点不够理智
I think a ball is an irrational way to gain new acquaintance.

302
00:24:36,315 --> 00:24:40,445
如果时兴聊天而不是跳舞那该多好
It would be better if conversation, not dancing, were the order of the day.

303
00:24:40,611 --> 00:24:44,741
聊天确实理性得多，不过光聊天的话那还叫舞会么
Indeed, much more rational, but rather less like a ball.

304
00:24:44,907 --> 00:24:46,534
谢谢  曼丽
Thank you, Mary.

305
00:24:47,618 --> 00:24:51,914
这地方多么壮观多么大气啊  不是吗，亲爱的？
What a fine imposing place to be sure, is it not, my dears?

306
00:24:52,081 --> 00:24:55,418
全郡再也找不到这么好的房子了
There's no house to equal it in the county.

307
00:24:55,626 --> 00:24:57,336
- 达西先生  - 班纳特小姐
- Mr Darcy.  - Miss Bennet.

308
00:24:57,503 --> 00:25:00,339
- 她在那  - 我对你感激不尽
- There she is.  - I don't know how to thank you.

309
00:25:00,506 --> 00:25:03,342
如果觉得不舒服，尽管来找我好了
You're welcome any time you feel the least bit poorly.

310
00:25:03,509 --> 00:25:06,679
谢谢你有生气的陪伴，让我受益匪浅
Thank you for your stimulating company. Most instructive.

311
00:25:06,846 --> 00:25:10,433
不客气，荣幸之至
Not at all. The pleasure is all mine.

312
00:25:13,102 --> 00:25:15,062
- 达西先生  - 伊丽莎白小姐
- Mr Darcy.  - Miss Elizabeth.

313
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:32,455
这时有个很长的鞭子，像母牛一样
And then there was one with great long lashes, like a cow.

314
00:25:32,622 --> 00:25:35,374
叫希尔太太给我们做牛腩，伊丽莎白
Ask Mrs Hill to order us a sirloin, Betsy.

315
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:38,961
注意，只要一块，我们没钱
Just the one, mind. We're not made of money.

316
00:25:41,422 --> 00:25:45,343
我的好太太，希望你今天的午饭准备得丰盛一些
I hope, my dear, you've ordered a good dinner today.

317
00:25:45,551 --> 00:25:49,388
恐怕今天有客人来
I've reason to expect an addition to our family party.

318
00:25:49,597 --> 00:25:52,350
他就是柯林斯先生，那位可怕的堂哥
His name's Mr Collins, the dreaded cousin.

319
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:54,977
-那个继承人吗？ -是啊  继承所有家产
- Who is to inherit?  - Everything.

320
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:58,022
连我的钢琴凳都是柯林斯先生的
Even my piano stool belongs to Mr Collins.

321
00:25:58,189 --> 00:25:59,190
什么时候？
When?

322
00:25:59,398 --> 00:26:02,401
只要他愿意，他随时能把我们撵出这所屋子
He may turn us out of the house as soon as he pleases.

323
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,741
我们家的产业不能留给我们这些可怜的女人
The estate passes directly to him

324
00:26:04,742 --> 00:26:05,863
却要让别人来继承
and not to us poor females.

325
00:26:11,285 --> 00:26:13,496
柯林斯先生，愿为你效劳
Mr Collins, at your service.

326
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,801
多漂亮的房间啊，多漂亮的土豆啊
What a superbly featured room and what excellent potatoes.

327
00:26:27,885 --> 00:26:31,973
我好多年都没有吃到这样的蔬菜了
It's many years since I've had such an exemplary vegetable.

328
00:26:32,139 --> 00:26:36,435
是哪位堂妹的厨艺如此高超，令我称赞不已？
To which fair cousin should I compliment the excellence of the cooking?

329
00:26:36,644 --> 00:26:39,105
我们还算过得去，还请得起厨子
We are perfectly able to keep a cook.

330
00:26:39,272 --> 00:26:41,232
好极了
Excellent.

331
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:44,819
我非常高兴看到这份产业能供得起如此优越的生活
I'm very pleased the estate can afford such a living.

332
00:26:48,364 --> 00:26:48,974
我三生有幸
I'm honoured to have

333
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:51,784
能有位像凯瑟琳·德·包尔夫人那样的女资助人
as my patroness Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

334
00:26:51,951 --> 00:26:54,578
我想你们已经听说她了吧？
You've heard of her, I presume?

335
00:26:54,745 --> 00:26:58,749
我的小教区毗邻她的庄园
My small rectory abuts her estate,

336
00:26:58,916 --> 00:27:01,585
罗新斯花园，她还常乘她的四轮小马车
Rosings Park, and she often condescends

337
00:27:01,752 --> 00:27:07,591
拜访我的寒舍
to drive by my humble dwelling in her little phaeton and ponies.

338
00:27:07,758 --> 00:27:09,385
她有亲人吗？
Does she have any family?

339
00:27:09,593 --> 00:27:11,747
她有个女儿，将要继承罗新斯
One daughter, the heiress of Rosings

340
00:27:11,748 --> 00:27:14,056
还能继承非常可观的一笔遗产呢
and very extensive property.

341
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:16,392
我常对凯瑟琳夫人说
I've often observed to Lady Catherine

342
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,645
她的女儿天生就是公爵夫人的命
that her daughter seemed born to be a duchess,

343
00:27:19,854 --> 00:27:25,609
因为她的气质优雅尊贵
for she has all the superior graces of elevated rank.

344
00:27:25,818 --> 00:27:29,572
这样巧妙的恭维，太太小姐们没有不乐意听的
These kind of compliments are always acceptable to the ladies,

345
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:34,076
我总觉得我应该在这方面特别留意
and which I conceive myself particularly bound to pay.

346
00:27:34,243 --> 00:27:36,787
真为你高兴，柯林斯先生
How happy for you, Mr Collins,

347
00:27:36,954 --> 00:27:40,541
你能有这种才能，能够非常巧妙的捧人家的场
to possess the talent for flattering with such delicacy.

348
00:27:42,626 --> 00:27:46,130
你这种讨人喜欢的奉承话，是灵机一动呢
Do these attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment

349
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:48,758
还是老早想好了的？
or are they the result of previous study?

350
00:27:48,966 --> 00:27:51,510
大半是应景之作
They arise from what is passing at the time.

351
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:54,544
不过有时候我也预先想好一些很好的小恭维话
And though I do sometimes amuse myself

352
00:27:54,545 --> 00:27:56,098
平常有机会就拿来应用
with arranging such little compliments,

353
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:59,894
而且临时说的时候总是要装得自然而然
I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible.

354
00:28:00,102 --> 00:28:04,190
相信我，没人想得到你的礼貌竟然是排练过的
Oh, believe me, no one would suspect your manners to be rehearsed.

355
00:28:10,905 --> 00:28:14,408
我想晚饭后可以给大家读一到两个小时的书
After dinner, I thought I might read to you for an hour or two.

356
00:28:14,575 --> 00:28:17,578
我随身带着《讲道集》
I have with me Fordyce's Sermons

357
00:28:17,745 --> 00:28:22,208
这是本关于行为道德的善辩集
which speak very eloquently on all matters moral.

358
00:28:22,416 --> 00:28:26,796
你读过《讲道集》吗，班纳特小姐？
Are you familiar with Fordyce's Sermons, Miss Bennet?

359
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:36,722
班纳特太太，承蒙凯瑟琳·德·包尔夫人的厚爱
Mrs Bennet, I have been bestowed by the good grace of Lady Catherine de Bourgh

360
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:39,350
提拔我担任教区牧师的职位
a parsonage of no mean size.

361
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:41,644
我已经知道了
I have become aware of the fact.

362
00:28:41,852 --> 00:28:45,773
我真心希望能尽快给我的牧师住宅找到一位女主人
It is my avowed hope that soon I may find a mistress for it.

363
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:49,360
我得告诉你，班纳特大小姐
And I have to inform you that the eldest Miss Bennet

364
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:53,364
已经俘获了我的心
has captured my special attention.

365
00:28:53,572 --> 00:28:56,283
噢，柯林斯先生
Oh, Mr Collins.

366
00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:00,579
很不幸，我有责任提醒你一下
Unfortunately, it is incumbent upon me

367
00:29:00,746 --> 00:29:07,002
班纳特大小姐很快就要订婚了
to hint that the eldest Miss Bennet is very soon to be engaged.

368
00:29:07,169 --> 00:29:08,504
订婚
Engaged.

369
00:29:08,671 --> 00:29:09,373
但是伊丽莎白小姐
But Miss Lizzie,

370
00:29:09,374 --> 00:29:11,131
无论是年纪还是美貌，比大小姐都只差一步
next to her in age and beauty,

371
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,760
她定会是个不错的伴侣
would make anyone an excellent partner.

372
00:29:14,927 --> 00:29:18,973
你赞同吗？柯林斯先生？
Do not you agree? Mr Collins?

373
00:29:19,139 --> 00:29:23,519
当然，当然
Indeed. Indeed.

374
00:29:23,727 --> 00:29:26,188
一个非常好的备选
A very agreeable alternative.

375
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:51,797
柯林斯先生会让人对全天下的男人丧失信心
Mr Collins is a man who makes you despair at the entire sex.

376
00:29:51,964 --> 00:29:53,038
对你确实是
Yours, I believe.

377
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,260
韦翰先生，你是多么十全十美阿
Oh, Mr Wickham, how perfect you are.

378
00:29:56,468 --> 00:29:59,638
- 他捡起我的手帕  - 你是故意丢手帕的？
- He picked up my handkerchief.  - Did you drop yours on purpose?

379
00:29:59,805 --> 00:30:01,265
韦翰先生是位陆军中尉
Mr Wickham is a lieutenant.

380
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:02,906
一位丢了魂的陆军中尉
An enchanted lieutenant.

381
00:30:02,907 --> 00:30:04,268
你要干什么，丽迪雅？
What are you up to, Liddy?

382
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:05,978
我们碰巧来挑丝带
We happened to be looking for ribbon.

383
00:30:05,979 --> 00:30:07,521
白色的，为舞会准备的
White, for the ball.

384
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:10,274
我们能一起挑挑丝带吗？
Shall we all look for some ribbon together?

385
00:30:13,402 --> 00:30:15,112
下午好，詹姆斯先生
Good afternoon, Mr James.

386
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:16,822
丽迪雅小姐，班纳特小姐
Miss Lydia, Miss Bennet.

387
00:30:17,031 --> 00:30:18,532
我不该来的
I shan't even browse.

388
00:30:18,699 --> 00:30:21,452
不能指望我，我对丝带毫无鉴赏力
I can't be trusted. I have poor taste in ribbons.

389
00:30:21,618 --> 00:30:24,163
只有真正自信的人才会承认这一点
Only a truly confident man would admit that.

390
00:30:24,329 --> 00:30:25,789
不，我说真的
No, it's true.

391
00:30:25,956 --> 00:30:29,126
还有皮带扣。对于皮带扣，我也一窍不通
And buckles. When it comes to buckles, I'm lost.

392
00:30:29,293 --> 00:30:32,713
-军团一定以你为耻  -不，是把我当成笑柄
- You must be the shame of the regiment.  - The laughing stock.

393
00:30:32,921 --> 00:30:36,008
你的上级怎么对你呢？
What do your superiors do with you?

394
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:41,680
无视我。我几乎毫无价值，所以无视我就很容易
Ignore me. I'm of next to no importance, so it's easily done.

395
00:30:42,848 --> 00:30:44,639
伊丽莎白，借我点钱
Lizzie, lend me some money.

396
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,018
你欠我的还没还呢
You already owe me a fortune.

397
00:30:46,894 --> 00:30:48,549
请允许我帮个小忙
Allow me to oblige.

398
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,481
不，韦翰先生，不要...
No, Mr Wickham, please...

399
00:30:55,944 --> 00:30:58,238
我坚持
I insist.

400
00:31:01,408 --> 00:31:04,495
-我真同情那个法国人  -我也是
- I pity the French.  - So do l.

401
00:31:04,661 --> 00:31:07,331
- 瞧，彬格莱先生  - 彬格莱先生！
- Look, Mr Bingley.  - Mr Bingley!

402
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,708
我正准备去你们家
I was just on my way to your house.

403
00:31:09,917 --> 00:31:13,003
你喜欢我特地为你的舞会准备的丝带吗？
How do you like my ribbons for your ball?

404
00:31:13,212 --> 00:31:14,352
非常漂亮
Very beautiful.

405
00:31:14,353 --> 00:31:16,632
确实。瞧，她是那么的光彩照人
She is. Look, she's blooming.

406
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,425
丽迪雅
Oh, Lydia.

407
00:31:18,634 --> 00:31:22,221
一定要邀请韦翰先生，他是个诚实可靠的人
Be sure to invite Mr Wickham. He is a credit to his profession.

408
00:31:22,387 --> 00:31:25,724
你不能邀请人去别人的舞会
You can't invite people to other people's balls.

409
00:31:26,308 --> 00:31:28,519
当然，你一定要来，韦翰先生
Of course, you must come, Mr Wickham.

410
00:31:28,685 --> 00:31:33,148
失陪了，小姐们。祝你们过得愉快
If you'll excuse me, ladies, enjoy the day.

411
00:31:35,818 --> 00:31:39,071
你打算去尼日斐的舞会吗，韦翰先生？
Do you plan to go to the Netherfield ball, Mr Wickham?

412
00:31:39,238 --> 00:31:44,785
也许会去。达西先生在这里做客多久了？
Perhaps. How long has Mr Darcy been a guest there?

413
00:31:44,952 --> 00:31:46,829
大概1个月了
About a month.

414
00:31:46,995 --> 00:31:52,543
请原谅我的冒昧，你和达西先生很熟吗？
Forgive me, but are you acquainted with him, with Mr Darcy?

415
00:31:52,709 --> 00:31:57,005
实际上，我从小就和他家里有特别的关系
Indeed, I've been connected with his family since infancy.

416
00:31:57,214 --> 00:32:02,094
你一定很惊讶，下午我们见面时那冷冰冰的样子
You may well be surprised, given our cold greeting this afternoon.

417
00:32:04,888 --> 00:32:08,392
你既然有意在麦里屯发展，希望你不要
I hope your plans in favour of Meryton will not be affected

418
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,113
因为你和这位绅士的关系而影响你原来的计划
by your relations with the gentleman.

419
00:32:11,114 --> 00:32:12,604
我才不会让达西先生赶走呢
It is not for me to be driven away.

420
00:32:12,771 --> 00:32:17,734
要是他不愿意看到我，那该走的是他，而不是我
If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go, not l.

421
00:32:17,943 --> 00:32:22,573
我一定要问问，达西先生的什么行为让你如此不快
I must ask, what is the manner of your disapproval of Mr Darcy?

422
00:32:25,784 --> 00:32:28,954
我父亲是他家的管家
My father managed his estate.

423
00:32:29,162 --> 00:32:32,332
达西和我从小一起长大
We grew up together, Darcy and I.

424
00:32:32,499 --> 00:32:35,716
他的父亲对待我就好像亲儿子一样
His father treated me like a second son,

425
00:32:35,717 --> 00:32:38,505
像疼爱儿子一样的疼爱我
loved me like a son.

426
00:32:38,714 --> 00:32:41,174
他父亲去世的那天，我们一起
We were both with him the day he died.

427
00:32:43,176 --> 00:32:45,053
守在他的床前到最后一刻
With his last breath,

428
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:48,390
他父亲的遗嘱上说明把教区牧师职位给我
his father bequeathed me the rectory in his estate.

429
00:32:48,598 --> 00:32:52,185
他早就知道我一心想加入教会
He knew I had my heart set on joining the Church.

430
00:32:52,352 --> 00:32:53,953
但是达西无视他父亲的遗愿
But Darcy ignored his wishes

431
00:32:53,954 --> 00:32:55,689
把那个牧师职位给了别人
and gave the living to another man.

432
00:32:55,897 --> 00:32:58,692
- 但为什么呢？  - 嫉妒
- But why?  - Jealousy.

433
00:33:00,694 --> 00:33:03,322
他的父亲...
His father...

434
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:06,575
唔，他的父亲疼爱我甚过他，达西无法容忍
Well, he loved me better and Darcy couldn't stand it.

435
00:33:07,659 --> 00:33:08,549
多么残酷阿
How cruel.

436
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,329
所以到现在我还是个一贫如洗的士兵
So now I'm a poor foot-soldier.

437
00:33:10,495 --> 00:33:14,249
低微得引不起任何人的注意
Too lowly even to be noticed.

438
00:33:25,886 --> 00:33:30,265
- 摒住呼吸  - 我不行了，你弄疼我了
- Breathe in!  - I can't anymore. You're hurting.

439
00:33:33,518 --> 00:33:34,686
伊丽莎白
Betsy.

440
00:33:35,812 --> 00:33:37,439
伊丽莎白！
Betsy!

441
00:33:48,867 --> 00:33:50,600
那一定是个误会
There must've been a misunderstanding.

442
00:33:50,601 --> 00:33:53,121
吉英，你从来都不把人往坏处想
Jane, you never think ill of anybody.

443
00:33:53,288 --> 00:33:56,875
达西先生怎么会做出那样的事情？
How could Mr Darcy do such a thing?

444
00:33:57,042 --> 00:34:00,378
今天晚上我就问问彬格莱先生事情的真相
I will discover the truth from Mr Bingley this evening.

445
00:34:00,587 --> 00:34:02,881
让达西先生自己来辩驳
Let Mr Darcy contradict it himself.

446
00:34:03,048 --> 00:34:05,342
除非他解释得通  不然我但愿永远不再见到他
Till he does, I hope never to encounter him.

447
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:07,803
可怜，不幸的，韦翰先生
Poor, unfortunate, Mr Wickham.

448
00:34:08,011 --> 00:34:10,138
韦翰比达西更像男子汉
Wickham is twice the man Darcy is.

449
00:34:10,305 --> 00:34:14,059
但愿他也是个更乐于跳舞的人
And, let us hope, a rather more willing dancer.

450
00:34:19,314 --> 00:34:21,108
他们在那，瞧
There they are, look.

451
00:34:21,274 --> 00:34:24,444
- 噢，是的  - 比利
- Oh, yes.  - Billy.

452
00:34:30,116 --> 00:34:32,160
吉英  马丁在这里
Jane, Martin is here.

453
00:35:00,021 --> 00:35:03,608
能再次见到你真是无比的荣幸
May I say what an immense pleasure it is to see you again.

454
00:35:03,817 --> 00:35:05,861
- 班纳特太太  - 彬格莱小姐
- Mrs Bennet.  - Miss Bingley.

455
00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:07,070
真迷人
Charming.

456
00:35:09,865 --> 00:35:11,825
我很高兴你能来
I'm so pleased you're here.

457
00:35:11,992 --> 00:35:14,202
我也是
So am I.

458
00:35:14,411 --> 00:35:19,374
你还好吗？伊丽莎白小姐？你在找人吗？
And how are you? Miss Elizabeth? Are you looking for someone?

459
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:24,045
不，不是，我只是惊叹这里如此光彩壮丽
No, not at all, I was just admiring the general splendour.

460
00:35:24,212 --> 00:35:27,966
- 令人叹为观止，彬格莱先生  - 太好了
- It is breathtaking, Mr Bingley.  - Good.

461
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:40,604
你也许已经和彬格莱先生打趣过了
You might have passed a few pleasantries with Mr Bingley.

462
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:44,524
我一生从没见过这么令人愉快的绅士
I've never met a more pleasant gentleman in all my years.

463
00:35:44,733 --> 00:35:47,193
你看到他多么喜爱她吗？
Did you see how he dotes on her?

464
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:52,073
亲爱的吉英，总是为家人打算
Dear Jane, always doing what's best for her family.

465
00:36:09,591 --> 00:36:11,551
- 夏洛特！  - 伊丽莎白！
- Charlotte!  - Lizzie!

466
00:36:11,718 --> 00:36:14,403
你有看到韦翰先生吗？
Have you seen Mr Wickham?

467
00:36:14,404 --> 00:36:16,514
没有，可能他来过这
No. Perhaps he's through here.

468
00:36:28,777 --> 00:36:30,925
伊丽莎白，韦翰先生不在这
Lizzie, Mr Wickham is not here.

469
00:36:30,926 --> 00:36:33,073
显然，他被事情耽误了
Apparently, he's been detained.

470
00:36:33,281 --> 00:36:36,534
在哪耽误？他一定在这
Detained where? He must be here.

471
00:36:36,743 --> 00:36:40,955
- 你在这啊  - 柯林斯先生
- There you are.  - Mr Collins.

472
00:36:41,122 --> 00:36:44,626
你能赏脸和我跳舞吗？伊丽莎白小姐
Perhaps you will do me the honour, Miss Elizabeth.

473
00:36:44,834 --> 00:36:48,922
噢，我没想到你会跳舞，柯林斯先生
Oh, I did not think you danced, Mr Collins.

474
00:36:49,089 --> 00:36:53,635
我认为这和牧师的职责不相违背
I do not think it incompatible with the office of a clergyman.

475
00:36:53,802 --> 00:36:57,222
相反，有些人，包括贵妇人们在内都称赞
Several people, her Ladyship included, have complimented me

476
00:36:57,389 --> 00:37:01,059
我轻盈的舞步呢
on my lightness of foot.

477
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:30,421
显然，你的韦翰先生有事上城里去了
Apparently, your Mr Wickham has been called on some business to town.

478
00:37:33,758 --> 00:37:37,804
跳舞对我来说影响不大，但是...
Dancing is of little consequence to me, but it does...

479
00:37:37,971 --> 00:37:41,558
它为慷慨给予了机会...
...but it does afford the opportunity to lavish...

480
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,389
...取决于舞伴的注意力...
... upon one's partner attentions...

481
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,899
有人告诉我...
My informer tells me...

482
00:37:50,108 --> 00:37:55,154
韦翰先生要不是为了要回避这儿的某一位先生
that he would be less inclined to be engaged, were it not for...

483
00:37:55,363 --> 00:37:57,574
决不会这么凑巧，偏偏这个时候因事缺席
...the presence of a certain gentleman.

484
00:37:57,782 --> 00:37:59,826
谁是我的第一舞伴
Which is my primary object.

485
00:38:00,034 --> 00:38:02,829
不用说也知道那位绅士是谁
That gentleman barely warrants the name.

486
00:38:02,996 --> 00:38:05,915
请恕我冒昧，我是有意为之
It is my intention, if I may be so bold,

487
00:38:06,082 --> 00:38:08,626
整晚与你保持亲密
to remain close to you throughout the evening.

488
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:25,476
我能和你跳下一支舞吗？伊丽莎白小姐
May I have the next dance, Miss Elizabeth?

489
00:38:25,685 --> 00:38:27,562
可以
You may.

490
00:38:37,697 --> 00:38:39,698
我居然同意和达西先生跳舞了？
Did I agree to dance with Mr Darcy?

491
00:38:39,699 --> 00:38:41,826
你将来一定会发觉他很讨人喜欢的
I dare say you will find him amiable.

492
00:38:41,993 --> 00:38:47,040
那一定非常难，因为我发誓一辈子讨厌他
It would be most inconvenient since I've sworn to loathe him for all eternity.

493
00:39:02,013 --> 00:39:05,850
- 我爱这支舞曲  - 确实，非常令人鼓舞
- I love this dance.  - Indeed. Most invigorating.

494
00:39:09,979 --> 00:39:12,440
现在该轮到你说点什么啦，达西先生
It is your turn to say something, Mr Darcy.

495
00:39:13,941 --> 00:39:15,401
我既然谈了舞曲
I talked about the dance.

496
00:39:15,568 --> 00:39:20,448
你就得谈谈舞池的大小以及有多少舞伴之类的问题
Now you ought to remark on the size of the room or the number of couples.

497
00:39:20,615 --> 00:39:24,702
乐意遵命。你最想听什么？
I'm perfectly happy to oblige. What would you like most to hear?

498
00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:27,163
这个回答眼前也说得过去了
That reply will do for present.

499
00:39:30,416 --> 00:39:32,543
待一会我或许会谈到
Perhaps by and by I may observe

500
00:39:32,752 --> 00:39:35,922
私人舞会比公共场所的舞会更好
that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones.

501
00:39:38,508 --> 00:39:41,677
不过，我们现在可以不必作声了
For now, we may remain silent.

502
00:39:49,394 --> 00:39:52,480
那么说，你跳起舞来照例总得要谈上几句吗？
Do you talk as a rule while dancing?

503
00:39:52,688 --> 00:39:56,526
不，不，我更喜欢不爱交际和沉默
No. No, I prefer to be unsociable and taciturn.

504
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:03,950
这样会让别人更愉快，你不觉得吗？
Makes it all so much more enjoyable, don't you think?

505
00:40:06,327 --> 00:40:10,248
告诉我，你和你的姐妹们经常上麦里屯溜达吗？
Tell me, do you and your sisters very often walk to Meryton?

506
00:40:12,959 --> 00:40:16,379
是的，我们常常去
Yes, we often walk to Meryton.

507
00:40:16,546 --> 00:40:19,507
那是结识新朋友的好机会
It's a great opportunity to meet new people.

508
00:40:21,384 --> 00:40:23,271
你那天在那儿碰到我们的时候
When you met us,

509
00:40:23,272 --> 00:40:25,304
我们正在结交一个新朋友呢
we'd just had the pleasure of forming a new acquaintance.

510
00:40:27,181 --> 00:40:31,394
韦翰先生生来满面春风，交起朋友来得心应手
Mr Wickham's blessed with such happy manners, he's sure of making friends.

511
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:34,313
至于他是不是能和朋友们长久相处，那就未必了
Whether he's capable of retaining them is less so.

512
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:40,236
他真不幸，竟失去了您的友谊。不可挽回了吗？
He's been so unfortunate as to lose your friendship. That is irreversible?

513
00:40:40,444 --> 00:40:42,509
是的，你问我这些话用意何在？
It is. Why do you ask such a question?

514
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,574
只不过为了要了解了解你的性格罢了
To make out your character.

515
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,198
那么你究竟弄明白了没有？
What have you discovered?

516
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:47,201
我一点儿也弄不明白
Very little.

517
00:40:47,451 --> 00:40:49,263
我听到人家对于你的看法并不一致
I hear such different accounts of you

518
00:40:49,264 --> 00:40:50,955
叫我不知道相信谁的话才好
as puzzle me exceedingly.

519
00:40:52,331 --> 00:40:54,876
我希望将来我能让你对我有更清晰的认识
I hope to afford you more clarity in the future.

520
00:41:41,547 --> 00:41:43,705
那是彭伯里庄园的达西先生吗？
Is that Mr Darcy of Pemberley?

521
00:41:43,706 --> 00:41:44,425
我想是的
I believe so.

522
00:41:44,592 --> 00:41:46,385
我一定要向达西先生自我介绍
I must make myself known to him.

523
00:41:46,552 --> 00:41:49,472
他是我的女资助人凯瑟琳夫人的侄儿
He's a nephew of my patroness, Lady Catherine.

524
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:52,600
他会认为那是很冒失的行为
He will consider it an impertinence.

525
00:41:52,767 --> 00:41:55,311
达西先生
Mr Darcy.

526
00:41:55,478 --> 00:41:57,605
达西先生
Mr Darcy.

527
00:41:58,689 --> 00:42:03,486
达西先生，晚上好...
Mr Darcy. Good evening...

528
00:42:03,694 --> 00:42:06,614
你的亲戚多么有趣啊
What interesting relatives you have.

529
00:42:24,006 --> 00:42:27,843
曼丽，亲爱的，你使我们开心得够久啦
Mary, dear, you've delighted us long enough.

530
00:42:28,052 --> 00:42:31,389
留点时间给别的小姐们表演表演吧
Let the other young ladies have a turn.

531
00:42:34,392 --> 00:42:37,103
...当我还是孩子的时候，她就去世了
...since I was a child, and then she died.

532
00:42:37,269 --> 00:42:38,979
我有漂亮的灰色
I have a beautiful grey.

533
00:42:39,188 --> 00:42:43,025
当然，卡罗琳的马术比我好，绝对
Of course, Caroline's a much better rider than l, of course.

534
00:42:46,987 --> 00:42:51,367
噢，是的，我们热切期盼着这门好处多多的婚事
Oh, yes. We fully expect a most advantageous marriage.

535
00:42:52,535 --> 00:42:54,440
如果我的吉英能攀得这么称心如意的姻缘
And my Jane, marrying so grand,

536
00:42:54,441 --> 00:42:56,664
那么，她的妹妹们也就有希望碰上别的阔少
must throw her sisters in the way.

537
00:43:18,811 --> 00:43:23,858
显然我们家像是约定今天晚上到这儿来尽量出丑的
Clearly my family are seeing who can expose themselves to the most ridicule.

538
00:43:24,066 --> 00:43:27,987
- 至少，彬格莱先生没有注意到  - 没有
- At least Bingley has not noticed.  - No.

539
00:43:28,154 --> 00:43:31,657
- 我想他真的很喜欢她  - 但是她喜欢他吗？
- I think he likes her very much.  - But does she like him?

540
00:43:31,824 --> 00:43:35,953
几乎没有人能够不仰赖适当的鼓励而陷入爱河
Few of us are secure enough to be in love without proper encouragement.

541
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,497
彬格莱非常喜欢她
Bingley likes her enormously,

542
00:43:38,706 --> 00:43:41,417
但是可能以后不会了，如果她还不帮帮他
but might not do more if she does not help him on.

543
00:43:41,584 --> 00:43:42,305
她只是害羞
She's just shy.

544
00:43:42,306 --> 00:43:45,337
如果他感觉不到她的关心，他一定是个傻瓜
If he cannot perceive her regard, he is a fool.

545
00:43:45,504 --> 00:43:47,965
陷入爱河的人都是傻瓜
We are all fools in love.

546
00:43:48,132 --> 00:43:51,135
他不像我们那么了解她的性格
He does not know her character as we do.

547
00:43:51,343 --> 00:43:53,721
她应该尽快把他弄到手
She should move fast and snap him up.

548
00:43:53,888 --> 00:43:57,308
我们以后有的是时间来了解他
There is plenty of time for us to get to know him afterwards.

549
00:43:58,601 --> 00:44:02,438
我觉得有人会放出小猪来
I can't help feeling that someone's going to produce a piglet

550
00:44:02,605 --> 00:44:04,565
让我们来追赶
and make us chase it.

551
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:15,034
- 噢，亲爱的！  - 我很抱歉，先生
- Oh, dear!  - I do apologise, sir.

552
00:44:15,242 --> 00:44:19,163
我真的很抱歉，请原谅我
I'm awfully sorry. Do forgive me.

553
00:44:38,724 --> 00:44:40,935
艾米莉，不要！
Emily, please!

554
00:44:42,353 --> 00:44:43,959
曼丽，我亲爱的曼丽
Mary, my dear Mary.

555
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,815
噢亲爱的，噢亲爱的，噢亲爱的
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

556
00:44:46,982 --> 00:44:50,152
- 我整整一星期都在练  - 我知道，亲爱的
- I've been practising all week.  - I know, my dear.

557
00:44:50,361 --> 00:44:52,738
我讨厌舞会
I hate balls.

558
00:45:11,715 --> 00:45:14,009
班纳特老爷，醒醒
Mr Bennet, wake up.

559
00:45:14,176 --> 00:45:18,889
噢，我从没玩得这么尽兴过
Oh, I've never had such a good time!

560
00:45:21,266 --> 00:45:23,644
查尔斯，你不会是认真的吧
Charles, you cannot be serious.

561
00:45:30,734 --> 00:45:36,240
班纳特先生  不出3个月我们就要办场婚事啦
We'll have a wedding here in less than three months if you ask me, Mr Bennet.

562
00:45:38,992 --> 00:45:40,577
班纳特老爷！
Mr Bennet!

563
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:49,002
曼丽，拜托
Mary, please.

564
00:45:57,094 --> 00:45:59,388
谢谢，希尔先生
Thank you, Mr Hill.

565
00:46:17,072 --> 00:46:20,159
班纳特太太，如果不麻烦的话
Mrs Bennet, I was hoping, if it would not trouble you,

566
00:46:20,367 --> 00:46:24,997
能让我和伊丽莎白小姐单独谈谈吗
that I might solicit a private audience with Miss Elizabeth.

567
00:46:25,205 --> 00:46:30,878
噢，当然可以。伊丽莎白会很乐意的
Oh, certainly, Lizzie would be very happy indeed.

568
00:46:31,044 --> 00:46:35,424
大家都出去，柯林斯先生想和你们的姐姐单独谈谈
Everyone, out. Mr Collins would like a private audience with your sister.

569
00:46:35,632 --> 00:46:38,447
等等，柯林斯先生没有什么不可告人的话
Wait, Mr Collins can have nothing

570
00:46:38,448 --> 00:46:40,012
非要单独和我说的
to say to me that anybody need not hear.

571
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:44,141
我要你待在这儿别动。其他所有人都去客厅
I desire you will stay where you are. Everyone else to the drawing room.

572
00:46:44,308 --> 00:46:45,851
- 班纳特老爷  - 但是...
- Mr Bennet.  - But...

573
00:46:46,018 --> 00:46:48,395
马上
Now.

574
00:46:49,396 --> 00:46:54,193
- 吉英，吉英，别...吉英！  - 吉英
- Jane. Jane, don't... Jane!  - Jane.

575
00:46:56,862 --> 00:46:59,948
爸爸，留下
Papa, stay.

576
00:47:26,391 --> 00:47:28,101
亲爱的伊丽莎白小姐
Dear Miss Elizabeth,

577
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:31,897
我对你的百般殷勤，已经表现得非常明显了
My attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.

578
00:47:32,105 --> 00:47:34,483
几乎是当我走进这房子的那一刻
Almost as soon as I entered the house,

579
00:47:34,691 --> 00:47:39,821
我就挑中你做我的终身伴侣
I singled you out as the companion of my future life.

580
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:42,699
趁我现在还控制得住我自己感情的时候
But before I am run away with my feelings,

581
00:47:42,866 --> 00:47:45,619
先陈述一下我要结婚的理由
perhaps I may state my reasons for marrying.

582
00:47:45,786 --> 00:47:48,247
第一，这是牧师的职责
Firstly, that it is the duty of a clergyman

583
00:47:48,413 --> 00:47:51,083
给全教区树立一个婚姻的好榜样
to set the example of matrimony in his parish.

584
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:55,254
其次，我深信结婚会大大地增进我的幸福
Secondly, I am convinced it will add greatly to my happiness.

585
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:58,340
第三，我尊敬的女资助人
And thirdly, that it is at the urging

586
00:47:58,507 --> 00:48:02,094
凯瑟琳夫人催促我
of my esteemed patroness, Lady Catherine,

587
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,638
挑选一个好太太
that I select a wife.

588
00:48:04,846 --> 00:48:07,933
我来浪博恩的目的就是
My object in coming to Longbourn was to choose such a one

589
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,143
从班纳特先生的女儿中挑选一个做太太
from among Mr Bennet's daughters,

590
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:13,230
因为我将要继承令尊的财产
for I am to inherit the estate

591
00:48:13,397 --> 00:48:16,566
而像这样的结合一定...
and such an alliance will surely...

592
00:48:17,776 --> 00:48:19,653
...会让每个人满意
...suit everyone.

593
00:48:21,822 --> 00:48:26,368
现在我只能用最激动的语言
And now nothing remains but for me to assure you in the most animated language

594
00:48:26,535 --> 00:48:28,231
把我最热烈的感情向你倾诉
of the violence of my affections.

595
00:48:28,232 --> 00:48:29,079
柯林斯先生！
Mr Collins!

596
00:48:29,287 --> 00:48:31,415
对于财产的有限，没有任何责备的意思
And no reproach on the subject of fortune

597
00:48:31,623 --> 00:48:34,401
我们结婚以后，我决不会说一句小气话
will cross my lips once we're married.

598
00:48:34,402 --> 00:48:36,253
你忘了我根本没有回答你呢
You forget I have given no answer.

599
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:40,007
凯瑟琳夫人定会赞同这门婚事，只要我向她说说
Lady Catherine will thoroughly approve when I speak to her

600
00:48:40,173 --> 00:48:45,303
你的淑静、节约以及其他种种可爱的优点
of your modesty, economy and other amiable qualities.

601
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:47,582
先生，你的求婚使我感到荣幸
Sir, I am honoured by your proposal,

602
00:48:47,583 --> 00:48:50,183
可惜我除了谢绝别无他法
but I regret that I must decline it.

603
00:48:51,351 --> 00:48:55,272
我知道，小姐们都会矜持推诿一下...
I know ladies don't seek to seem too eager...

604
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,829
柯林斯先生，我的谢绝完全是认真的
Mr Collins, I am perfectly serious.

605
00:48:57,830 --> 00:48:59,151
你不能使我幸福
You could not make me happy.

606
00:48:59,317 --> 00:49:02,988
而且我也绝对不能使你幸福
And I'm the last woman in the world who could make you happy.

607
00:49:03,196 --> 00:49:04,651
说句自不量力的话
I flatter myself

608
00:49:04,652 --> 00:49:07,743
你的拒绝不过是女人家微妙的天性
that your refusal is merely a natural delicacy.

609
00:49:07,909 --> 00:49:10,746
此外，尽管你有许多吸引人的地方
Besides, despite manifold attractions,

610
00:49:10,912 --> 00:49:15,208
但恐怕也不会有别人会向你求婚了
it is by no means certain another offer of marriage will ever be made to you.

611
00:49:15,417 --> 00:49:16,382
我就不得不认为
I must conclude

612
00:49:16,383 --> 00:49:19,004
你这样是欲擒故纵，想要更加博得我的喜爱
that you simply seek to increase my love by suspense,

613
00:49:19,212 --> 00:49:23,592
仿效一般高贵的女性的通例
according to the usual practice of elegant females.

614
00:49:23,759 --> 00:49:27,345
我不是那种故意捉弄尊敬绅士的女性
I am not the sort of female to torment a respectable man.

615
00:49:27,512 --> 00:49:30,056
请理解我，我不能接受你
Please understand me, I cannot accept you.

616
00:49:37,314 --> 00:49:40,484
顽固的傻孩子
Headstrong, foolish child.

617
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:54,372
别担心，柯林斯先生。我们马上就能解决这一切
Don't worry, Mr Collins. We'll have this little hiccup dealt with immediately.

618
00:49:55,499 --> 00:49:59,002
伊丽莎白，伊丽莎白！
Lizzie. Lizzie!

619
00:50:03,131 --> 00:50:07,427
班纳特老爷，家里都闹翻天了！
Mr Bennet, we're all in an uproar!

620
00:50:07,636 --> 00:50:11,306
你得来劝劝伊丽莎白嫁给柯林斯先生
You must come and make Lizzie marry Mr Collins.

621
00:50:11,473 --> 00:50:13,934
柯林斯先生已经向伊丽莎白求婚了
Mr Collins has proposed to Lizzie,

622
00:50:14,142 --> 00:50:17,729
但是她发誓不要他  现在危险的是
but she vowed she will not have him, and now the danger is

623
00:50:17,896 --> 00:50:20,732
柯林斯先生会不要伊丽莎白了
Mr Collins may not have Lizzie.

624
00:50:20,899 --> 00:50:25,529
- 我能做什么？  - 唔，过来和她谈谈
- What am I to do?  - Well, come and talk to her.

625
00:50:25,695 --> 00:50:26,863
马上！
Now!

626
00:50:39,542 --> 00:50:41,764
告诉她，你非要她嫁给他不可
Tell her you insist they marry.

627
00:50:41,765 --> 00:50:42,629
爸爸，不要
Papa, please.

628
00:50:42,796 --> 00:50:46,883
你将拥有这栋房子  还能让妹妹们免于受穷
You will have this house and save your sisters from destitution.

629
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:48,283
我不能嫁给他
I can't marry him.

630
00:50:48,284 --> 00:50:50,011
现在就回去告诉他，你已经改变了心意
Go back now and say you've changed your mind.

631
00:50:50,178 --> 00:50:52,722
- 为你的家人想想  - 你不能逼我
- Think of your family.  - You cannot make me.

632
00:50:52,889 --> 00:50:55,433
班纳特老爷，你倒是说点什么呀
Mr Bennet, say something.

633
00:50:59,354 --> 00:51:02,691
你母亲坚持要你嫁给柯林斯先生
Your mother insists upon you marrying Mr Collins.

634
00:51:02,899 --> 00:51:05,610
是的，否则我就再也不要见她了
Yes, or I shall never see her again.

635
00:51:05,777 --> 00:51:09,781
从今天起，你不和父亲绝交，就要和母亲绝交
From this day onward, you must be a stranger to one of your parents.

636
00:51:09,948 --> 00:51:12,409
当你父亲去世了，谁会养你？
Who will maintain you when your father is dead?

637
00:51:12,617 --> 00:51:14,375
要是你不嫁给柯林斯先生
Your mother will never see you again

638
00:51:14,376 --> 00:51:16,454
你的母亲就再不要见你了
if you do not marry Mr Collins,

639
00:51:16,621 --> 00:51:19,791
如果你嫁给他，我就再不要见你了
and I will never see you again if you do.

640
00:51:19,958 --> 00:51:21,584
谢谢，爸爸
Thank you, Papa.

641
00:51:25,338 --> 00:51:29,968
忘恩负义的孩子！我再也不理你了
Ungrateful child! I shall never speak to you again.

642
00:51:30,176 --> 00:51:32,846
我现在都没什么兴致说话了
Not that I take much pleasure in talking.

643
00:51:33,847 --> 00:51:36,599
象我这样神经脆弱的人
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints

644
00:51:36,766 --> 00:51:39,769
就没有多大的兴致说话
can have no pleasure in talking to anybody.

645
00:51:39,978 --> 00:51:41,688
吉英！
Jane!

646
00:51:44,983 --> 00:51:49,112
出什么事了？吉英？
What's the matter? Jane?

646
00:51:50,283 --> 00:51:52,912
致：赫特福德郡浪博恩
吉英·班纳特小姐

647
00:52:43,625 --> 00:52:47,045
我不明白是什么让他离开尼日斐花园
I don't understand what would take him from Netherfield.

648
00:52:47,212 --> 00:52:49,506
为什么他不知道什么时候会回来呢？
Why does he not know when he'll return?

649
00:52:49,672 --> 00:52:50,840
读读
Read it.

650
00:53:00,099 --> 00:53:02,351
“达西先生迫不急待地要去看看他的妹妹
"Mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister

651
00:53:02,352 --> 00:53:04,729
我们也几乎同样热切地希望和她重逢
and we are scarcely less eager.

652
00:53:04,938 --> 00:53:07,857
我认为乔治安娜·达西无论在容貌
I do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty,

653
00:53:08,024 --> 00:53:10,400
举止还是才艺方面都无人能及
elegance and accomplishment.

654
00:53:10,401 --> 00:53:11,945
希望她以后会做我的嫂嫂”
I hope to call her hereafter my sister."

655
00:53:12,111 --> 00:53:14,822
说得还不够清楚吗？
Is that not clear enough?

656
00:53:14,989 --> 00:53:17,700
卡罗琳看出她哥哥爱上你
Caroline sees her brother in love with you

657
00:53:17,867 --> 00:53:20,537
就把他带走，想方设法去说服他
and has taken him off to persuade him otherwise.

658
00:53:20,703 --> 00:53:25,667
但是我知道她不可能想骗谁就骗谁
But I know her to be incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone.

659
00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:28,838
看上去他好像真的不爱我了
It's more likely he does not love me.

660
00:53:28,839 --> 00:53:30,505
他爱你。别放弃
He loves you. Do not give up.

661
00:53:32,715 --> 00:53:34,759
去我们在伦敦的舅舅家
Go to our aunt and uncle's in London,

662
00:53:34,968 --> 00:53:38,555
让他知道你在那，我敢肯定他会来看你的
Let it be known you are there and I am sure he will come to you.

663
00:53:48,147 --> 00:53:49,903
请将我的爱赐予我的姐姐
Give my love to my sister

664
00:53:49,904 --> 00:53:52,777
让我的爱不要成为她的负担，亲爱的
and try not to be a burden, dear.

665
00:53:52,944 --> 00:53:55,405
可怜的吉英
Poor Jane.

666
00:53:55,613 --> 00:53:59,993
然而，女孩子总是喜欢被爱
Still, a girl likes to be crossed in love now and then.

667
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,544
这起码可以给她一些事情去思考
It gives her something to think of

668
00:54:02,711 --> 00:54:05,880
也可以使她觉得与其它同伴不同
and a sort of distinction amongst her companions.

669
00:54:06,089 --> 00:54:08,367
我相信那会令她振奋起来的，爸爸
I'm sure that will cheer her up, Papa.

670
00:54:08,368 --> 00:54:09,926
现在轮到你了，伊丽莎白
It's your turn now, Lizzie.

671
00:54:10,135 --> 00:54:12,012
你已经拒绝了柯林斯
You've turned down Collins.

672
00:54:12,178 --> 00:54:16,474
你现在是自由身了，自己成了甩别人的小姐了
You're free to go off and be jilted yourself.

673
00:54:16,641 --> 00:54:18,518
韦翰先生怎么样？
What about Mr Wickham?

674
00:54:18,685 --> 00:54:21,479
他是一位不错的年轻人，相信也靠得住
He's a pleasant fellow and he'd do the job credibly.

675
00:54:21,646 --> 00:54:25,317
- 父亲...  - 而且你有一个亲爱的母亲
- Father...  - And you have an affectionate mother

676
00:54:25,525 --> 00:54:29,112
她绝不会放弃这个机会的
who would make the most of it.

677
00:54:48,548 --> 00:54:50,675
- 夏洛特！  - 我亲爱的伊丽莎白
- Charlotte!  - My dear Lizzie.

678
00:54:50,884 --> 00:54:53,541
我来告诉你一个重要的消息
I've come here to tell you the news.

679
00:54:53,542 --> 00:54:56,389
柯林斯先生和我...订婚了
Mr Collins and I are... engaged.

680
00:54:56,556 --> 00:54:58,850
- 订婚了？  - 是的
- Engaged?  - Yes.

681
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,489
为了结婚的订婚？
To be married?

682
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:08,359
除此之外，还会有其他的类型的订婚么？
What other kind of engaged is there?

683
00:55:09,736 --> 00:55:13,156
看在上天的份上, 伊丽莎白，别那样看着我
For heaven's sake, Lizzie, don't look at me like that.

684
00:55:13,323 --> 00:55:16,326
嫁给他和嫁给其他任何人对我来说都一样开心
I should be as happy with him as any other.

685
00:55:16,534 --> 00:55:19,329
- 但是他的人十分荒谬  - 噢，不要这么说
- But he's ridiculous.  - Oh, hush.

686
00:55:19,496 --> 00:55:23,249
并不是所有的人都能拥有浪漫
Not all of us can afford to be romantic.

687
00:55:23,416 --> 00:55:27,253
他能给我一个舒适安全的家
I've been offered a comfortable home and protection.

688
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,130
值得我感激的已经够多了
There's a lot to be thankful for.

689
00:55:29,339 --> 00:55:34,761
我已经27岁了，我没有钱，也没什么前途
I'm 27 years old. I've no money and no prospects.

690
00:55:34,928 --> 00:55:38,515
我已经成了父母的包袱了
I'm already a burden to my parents.

691
00:55:38,681 --> 00:55:41,142
而且，我害怕了
And I'm frightened.

692
00:55:41,309 --> 00:55:45,855
所以，请不要评判我，伊丽莎白。别评判我
So don't judge me, Lizzie. Don't you dare judge me.

693
00:56:38,366 --> 00:56:41,202
亲爱的夏洛特，谢谢你的来信
Dear Charlotte, thank you for your letter.

694
00:56:42,537 --> 00:56:45,707
很高兴你对你的房子、家具以及舍路都满意
I'm glad the house, furniture and roads are to your taste,

695
00:56:45,873 --> 00:56:49,294
也高兴得知那位凯瑟琳女士对你友好和蔼
and that Lady Catherine's behaviour is friendly and obliging.

696
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:52,130
你走了，吉英去了伦敦
What with your departure, Jane's to London

697
00:56:52,297 --> 00:56:55,800
有趣的韦翰先生随民兵团去了北方
and the militia to the North with the colourful Mr Wickham,

698
00:56:55,967 --> 00:56:59,887
我必须承认, 现在我眼前的景色变得有点灰暗了
I must confess, the view from where I sit has been rather grey.

699
00:57:00,096 --> 00:57:03,057
至于你的请求，根本算不上是请求
As for the favour you ask, it is no favour at all.

700
00:57:03,224 --> 00:57:07,353
我会非常高兴尽早来探望你
I would be happy to visit you at your earliest convenience.

701
00:57:14,068 --> 00:57:16,112
欢迎光临寒舍
Welcome to our humble abode.

702
00:57:21,451 --> 00:57:25,204
为了我的健康，我的妻子鼓励我花点时间在花园里面
My wife encourages me to spend time in the garden for my health.

703
00:57:25,371 --> 00:57:27,749
我想我们的客人在旅途后已经感到疲惫了
I think our guest is tired after her journey.

704
00:57:27,957 --> 00:57:29,454
我计划了很多改进的方案
I plan many improvements.

705
00:57:29,455 --> 00:57:32,587
我打算要去掉一些大树桩然后在走道旁种上酸橙树
I intend to throw out a bough and plant a lime walk.

706
00:57:32,754 --> 00:57:33,701
说句自不量力的话
I flatter myself

707
00:57:33,702 --> 00:57:35,715
任何一个年轻女士都会
that any young lady would be happy

708
00:57:35,882 --> 00:57:38,885
为能成为这座房子的主妇而感到高兴的
to be the mistress of such a house.

709
00:57:40,053 --> 00:57:41,929
在这里没人打扰
We shan't be disturbed here.

710
00:57:42,138 --> 00:57:45,975
这间工作室是我专用的
This parlour is for my own particular use.

711
00:57:48,728 --> 00:57:52,815
伊丽莎白，能打理自己的家真是件高兴的事情
Oh, Lizzie, it's such a pleasure to run my own home.

712
00:57:52,982 --> 00:57:55,985
- 夏洛特，过来！  - 发生什么事了？
- Charlotte, come here!  - What's happened?

713
00:57:56,152 --> 00:58:00,156
猪又跑了吗？噢，是凯瑟琳夫人
Has the pig escaped again? Oh, it's Lady Catherine.

714
00:58:00,323 --> 00:58:02,867
过来看看，伊丽莎白
Come and see, Lizzie.

715
00:58:03,034 --> 00:58:05,661
好消息
Great news.

716
00:58:05,828 --> 00:58:09,082
凯瑟琳女士邀请我们去罗新斯花园
We received an invitation to Rosings from Lady Catherine.

717
00:58:09,248 --> 00:58:10,792
实在太好了！
How wonderful!

718
00:58:10,958 --> 00:58:13,961
千万不要为你的衣着担心
Do not make yourself uneasy about your apparel.

719
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:16,464
穿上你带来的最好的衣服就行了
Just put on the best you've brought.

720
00:58:16,631 --> 00:58:21,177
凯瑟琳夫人从来都不会嫌弃简陋
Lady Catherine's never been averse to the truly humble.

721
00:58:21,969 --> 00:58:25,473
全欧洲最非凡的景色之一
One of the most extraordinary sights in all of Europe.

722
00:58:25,681 --> 00:58:29,185
光是玻璃窗就花了两万英镑
The glazing alone costs upwards of ￡20,000.

723
00:58:29,393 --> 00:58:31,938
跟着来，跟紧
Come along. Come along.

724
00:58:40,738 --> 00:58:43,658
晚点我们会玩扑克牌
A little later we'll play cards.

725
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:47,495
尊贵的夫人
Your Ladyship.

726
00:58:47,662 --> 00:58:50,665
德·包尔小姐
Miss de Bourgh.

727
00:59:09,058 --> 00:59:11,310
那么，你是伊丽莎白·班纳特？
So, you are Elizabeth Bennet?

728
00:59:11,311 --> 00:59:12,562
是的，尊贵的夫人
I am, your Ladyship.

729
00:59:16,232 --> 00:59:18,693
这是我的女儿
This is my daughter.

730
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:22,903
感谢你邀请我们一同进餐
It's kind of you to ask us to dine.

731
00:59:22,904 --> 00:59:25,366
单这地毯就起码要300英镑
The rug alone cost upwards of ￡300.

732
00:59:27,159 --> 00:59:29,287
达西先生
Mr Darcy.

733
00:59:30,705 --> 00:59:32,748
你怎么会在这里？
What are you doing here?

734
00:59:34,876 --> 00:59:38,379
达西先生，没想到会有幸遇到你
Mr Darcy, I had no idea we had the honour.

735
00:59:40,131 --> 00:59:43,682
伊丽莎白小姐，我是来这做客的
Miss Elizabeth, I'm a guest here.

736
00:59:43,683 --> 00:59:45,261
你认识我的侄子?
You know my nephew?

737
00:59:46,929 --> 00:59:50,349
是的，在赫特福德郡，我有幸遇见你的侄子
I had the pleasure of meeting your nephew in Hertfordshire.

738
00:59:50,558 --> 00:59:53,269
我是费茨威廉上校  你好
Colonel Fitzwilliam. How do you do?

739
00:59:58,816 --> 01:00:02,743
柯林斯先生，你不能坐在你妻子的旁边
Mr Collins, you can't sit next to your wife.

740
01:00:02,744 --> 01:00:04,822
换个位置，到那边去
Move. Over there.

741
01:00:21,213 --> 01:00:24,884
哈维，我想你能不能给我那道鱼的菜...
Harvey, I wonder, could you get me the fish course...

742
01:00:25,051 --> 01:00:29,138
我想你们一家身体都健康吧，伊丽莎白小姐？
I trust your family is in good health, Miss Elizabeth?

743
01:00:29,305 --> 01:00:31,265
是的，谢谢
They are, thank you.

744
01:00:34,894 --> 01:00:37,980
我大姐在伦敦，可能你在那里见过她了
My eldest sister is in London. Perhaps you saw her there.

745
01:00:38,189 --> 01:00:40,149
我还未有幸能...
I haven't been fortunate enough...

746
01:00:40,358 --> 01:00:44,737
你会弹钢琴吗，班纳特小姐？
Do you play the pianoforte, Miss Bennet?

747
01:00:44,904 --> 01:00:47,938
只会一点点，夫人，弹得不怎么样
A little, ma'am, and very poorly.

748
01:00:47,939 --> 01:00:49,367
你会绘画吗？
Do you draw?

749
01:00:50,659 --> 01:00:52,787
不，一点都不会
No, not at all.

750
01:00:52,995 --> 01:00:55,206
你的姐妹呢？她们会绘画吗？
Your sisters, do they draw?

751
01:00:55,373 --> 01:00:56,707
没有一个会
Not one.

752
01:00:56,874 --> 01:00:58,376
这倒很稀奇
That's very strange.

753
01:00:58,542 --> 01:01:01,170
我猜你们是没机会学吧
I suppose you had no opportunity.

754
01:01:01,337 --> 01:01:05,257
你们的母亲应该带你们去城里面投名师才对
Your mother should've taken you to town for the benefit of the masters.

755
01:01:05,424 --> 01:01:09,553
我母亲是不会反对，可是我父亲讨厌城里
My mother wouldn't have minded, but my father hates town.

756
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,430
你们的女家庭教师走了吗？
Has your governess left you?

757
01:01:11,431 --> 01:01:13,140
我们从来没有请过女家庭教师
We never had a governess.

758
01:01:14,642 --> 01:01:15,792
没有女家庭教师？
No governess?

759
01:01:15,793 --> 01:01:18,813
家里教养着五个女儿，却不请个女教庭教师？
Five daughters brought up at home without a governess?

760
01:01:18,979 --> 01:01:20,830
我简直闻所未闻
I never heard such a thing.

761
01:01:20,831 --> 01:01:23,109
你母亲亲自教育你们，一定累得如同奴隶一般
Your mother must've been a slave to your education.

762
01:01:23,275 --> 01:01:25,319
凯瑟琳夫人，事实并非如此
Not at all, Lady Catherine.

763
01:01:30,157 --> 01:01:32,618
你的妹妹们有没有哪一个已经出来参加社交了？
Your younger sisters, are they out in society?

764
01:01:32,827 --> 01:01:34,954
- 有，太太，全都出来社交了  - 全部？
- Yes, ma'am, all.  - All?

765
01:01:35,121 --> 01:01:38,124
什么，五个姐妹同时出来社交？真奇怪
What, all five out at once? That's very odd.

766
01:01:38,290 --> 01:01:39,183
你排行第二
And you second.

767
01:01:39,184 --> 01:01:42,044
姐姐还没嫁人，妹妹就出来社交？
The younger ones out before the elders are married?

768
01:01:42,795 --> 01:01:45,714
你妹妹们一定还很小吧
Your youngest sisters must be very young.

769
01:01:45,881 --> 01:01:47,591
是的，最小的还没到16岁
Yes, my youngest is not 16.

770
01:01:48,467 --> 01:01:50,678
如果年少的妹妹因为年长的姐姐
But it would be hard on younger sisters

771
01:01:50,845 --> 01:01:54,515
没有结婚而不能进行社交活动
not to have their amusement because the elder is still unmarried.

772
01:01:54,682 --> 01:01:57,685
这一点都不会增进姐妹感情
It would hardly encourage sisterly affection.

773
01:01:57,852 --> 01:02:02,815
真想不到，你这么年轻，倒挺有主见啊
Upon my word, you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person.

774
01:02:03,023 --> 01:02:05,693
请问，你几岁啦？
Pray, what is your age?

775
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:07,482
我已经有了三个成人的妹妹
With three younger sisters grown up,

776
01:02:07,483 --> 01:02:09,780
你老人家总不会再要我招出年纪来吧
you can hardly expect me to own to it.

777
01:02:19,999 --> 01:02:22,042
过来，班纳特小姐，为我们弹奏一曲
Come, Miss Bennet, and play for us.

778
01:02:23,043 --> 01:02:26,547
- 不，请饶了我吧  - 音乐会使我高兴
- No, I beg you.  - For music is my delight.

779
01:02:26,714 --> 01:02:29,008
实际上目前在英国，没有几个人能像我一样
In fact, there are few people in England

780
01:02:29,174 --> 01:02:33,095
真正欣赏音乐
who have more true enjoyment of music.

781
01:02:33,262 --> 01:02:34,847
也没有人比我趣味更高
Or better natural taste.

782
01:02:35,806 --> 01:02:41,395
我要是学了音乐，一定会成为一个名家
If I had ever learnt, I should've been a great proficient.

783
01:02:41,562 --> 01:02:45,733
安娜要是身体好，也一定会成为一个名家的
So would Anne, if her health would've allowed her.

784
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:50,112
我不是假装谦虚，当我说我差的时候...
I'm not afflicted with false modesty, when I say I play poorly...

785
01:02:50,279 --> 01:02:54,033
过来，伊丽莎白，尊贵的夫人要你弹
Come, Lizzie, her Ladyship demands it.

786
01:03:15,971 --> 01:03:19,141
乔治安娜现在学得怎么样啦，达西？
How does Georgiana get along, Darcy?

787
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:22,770
- 她弹得非常好  - 我希望她有常练习
- She plays very well.  - I hope she practises.

788
01:03:22,936 --> 01:03:26,190
卓越的技能无一例外需要持久的练习
No excellence can be acquired without constant practice.

789
01:03:26,357 --> 01:03:28,817
我对柯林斯夫人说过
I've told Mrs Collins this.

790
01:03:29,026 --> 01:03:32,446
虽然你没有琴，也十分欢迎你来罗新斯花园
Though you have no instrument, you're welcome to come to Rosings

791
01:03:32,613 --> 01:03:35,616
在管家的房间里面弹钢琴
and play on the pianoforte in the housekeeper's room.

792
01:03:35,824 --> 01:03:39,662
你在那里不会妨碍任何人
You'll be in nobody's way in that part of the house.

793
01:03:46,877 --> 01:03:52,007
你这样走过来听，莫不是想吓唬我？
You mean to frighten me by coming in all your state to hear me.

794
01:03:52,174 --> 01:03:56,095
尽管你妹妹的确演奏得很好，我也不怕
But I won't be alarmed, even if your sister does play so well.

795
01:03:56,261 --> 01:04:00,182
就算想吓唬你，我知道是没法如愿的
I know that I cannot alarm you even should I wish it.

796
01:04:00,391 --> 01:04:04,311
我的朋友在赫特福德郡表现得怎么样?
What was my friend like in Hertfordshire?

797
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:07,523
你真的想知道?
You really care to know?

798
01:04:07,731 --> 01:04:10,901
我先得请你不要害怕
Prepare yourself for something very dreadful.

799
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:14,113
当我第一次见到他时，他不和任何人跳舞
The first time I saw him, he danced with nobody,

800
01:04:14,279 --> 01:04:15,906
尽管男客很少
though gentlemen were scarce

801
01:04:16,115 --> 01:04:18,867
当时在场的不少女客没有舞伴而闲坐一旁
and there was more than one lady without a partner.

802
01:04:19,034 --> 01:04:21,223
当时舞会上除了自己人，我谁都不认识
I knew nobody beyond my own party.

803
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:22,788
舞会里是不兴请人介绍女伴的
Nobody can be introduced at a ball.

804
01:04:22,996 --> 01:04:25,707
费茨威廉，过来
Fitzwilliam, I need you.

805
01:04:36,593 --> 01:04:39,054
我没有那种本领
I do not have the talent

806
01:04:39,263 --> 01:04:42,599
能跟新认识的人也谈笑风生
of conversing easily with people I have never met before.

807
01:04:43,016 --> 01:04:46,687
也许你应该听从你姑妈的意见多练习
Perhaps you should take your aunt's advice and practise.

808
01:05:07,666 --> 01:05:10,544
亲爱的吉英...
Dear Jane...

809
01:05:22,556 --> 01:05:23,891
达西先生
Mr Darcy.

810
01:05:31,773 --> 01:05:33,275
请，请坐
Please, do be seated.

811
01:05:39,239 --> 01:05:41,700
柯林斯夫妇到村里去了
Mr and Mrs Collins have gone to the village.

812
01:05:49,583 --> 01:05:51,543
这是座迷人的房子
This is a charming house.

813
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:53,412
我相信柯林斯先生初到这的时候
I believe my aunt did a great deal to it

814
01:05:53,413 --> 01:05:56,089
凯瑟琳夫人一定在这上面费了好大一番心思吧
when Mr Collins first arrived.

815
01:05:56,256 --> 01:05:58,634
我相信她的确费了一番心思
I believe so.

816
01:05:59,927 --> 01:06:01,313
她的好心并没有白费
She could not have bestowed her kindness

817
01:06:01,314 --> 01:06:05,057
因为没人能比柯林斯先生更感恩戴德了
on a more grateful subject.

818
01:06:13,482 --> 01:06:16,818
- 需要为你叫一杯茶么？  - 不用了，谢谢
- Shall I call for some tea?  - No, thank you.

819
01:06:20,864 --> 01:06:23,659
祝你愉快，伊丽莎白小姐，与你聊天很愉快
Good day, Miss Elizabeth, it's been a pleasure.

820
01:06:30,165 --> 01:06:33,669
你对可怜的达西先生到底做了什么啊？
What on earth have you done to poor Mr Darcy?

821
01:06:33,835 --> 01:06:36,213
我一点头绪都没有
I have no idea.

822
01:06:37,422 --> 01:06:40,133
每个灵魂都需要安抚者
Every mind must have some counsellor

823
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:43,970
在悲痛中能安抚你
to whom it may apply for consolation in distress.

824
01:06:44,137 --> 01:06:46,823
还有其他很多便利是别人能给予
There are many conveniences which others can supply

825
01:06:46,824 --> 01:06:48,934
但是我们无法提供的
and we cannot procure.

826
01:06:49,101 --> 01:06:50,977
以我的观点看来，那些便利
I have in view those objects

827
01:06:51,186 --> 01:06:54,272
是需要通过交流来获得的...
which are only to be obtained through intercourse...

828
01:06:56,650 --> 01:07:01,863
请原谅, 从友谊和礼节上的交流
Forgive me, through the intercourse of friendship or civility.

829
01:07:02,072 --> 01:07:05,696
在那种情况下，骄傲的人主动与你接触
On such occasions, the proud man steps forth to meet you

830
01:07:05,697 --> 01:07:07,828
不是出于他的诚恳
not with cordiality,

831
01:07:08,036 --> 01:07:12,833
而是出于一个像对敌人般的怀疑...
but with the suspicion of one who reconnoitres an enemy...

832
01:07:13,041 --> 01:07:16,628
- 你打算住多久  - 达西住多久我就住多久
- How long do you plan to stay?  - As long as Darcy chooses.

833
01:07:16,795 --> 01:07:20,048
- 我得听他调遣  - 看起来每个人都是如此
- I am at his disposal.  - Everyone appears to be.

834
01:07:20,215 --> 01:07:21,502
我不懂他为什么不还不结婚
I wonder he does not marry

835
01:07:21,503 --> 01:07:23,969
结了婚不就可以有个人一辈子听他摆布了吗？
and secure a lasting convenience of that kind.

836
01:07:24,177 --> 01:07:26,992
能成为达西太太，是件幸运的事
She would be a lucky woman.

837
01:07:26,993 --> 01:07:27,931
真的吗？
Really?

838
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:31,226
达西是一个对同伴最忠诚的人
Darcy is a most loyal companion.

839
01:07:31,435 --> 01:07:34,855
他最近才拯救了他的一个朋友
He recently came to the rescue of one of his friends.

840
01:07:35,021 --> 01:07:36,440
发生了什么事？
What happened?

841
01:07:36,606 --> 01:07:38,733
他把他的朋友从一门鲁莽的婚事中拯救出来
He saved him from an imprudent marriage.

842
01:07:38,942 --> 01:07:40,110
那个人是谁？
Who's the man?

843
01:07:45,782 --> 01:07:49,453
他最亲近的朋友，查尔斯·彬格莱
His closest friend, Charles Bingley.

844
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:54,791
达西先生有没有说，他为什么要管人家闲事？
Did Mr Darcy give a reason for this interference?

845
01:07:54,958 --> 01:07:58,128
那位小姐有些条件不大够格
There were apparently strong objections to the lady.

846
01:07:58,336 --> 01:08:01,590
什么条件？不富裕？
What kind of objections? Her lack of fortune?

847
01:08:01,798 --> 01:08:06,011
我想是她的家庭被认为是门不当户不对的
I think it was her family that was considered unsuitable.

848
01:08:07,554 --> 01:08:09,682
所以他就去拆散他们？
So he separated them?

849
01:08:09,683 --> 01:08:12,267
我想是的，我就知道这些
I believe so. I know nothing else.

850
01:08:42,547 --> 01:08:44,174
伊丽莎白小姐
Miss Elizabeth.

851
01:08:44,341 --> 01:08:46,968
我实在没有办法撑下去了
I have struggled in vain and can bear it no longer.

852
01:08:47,135 --> 01:08:49,297
这几个月对于我来说是一种折磨
These past months have been a torment.

853
01:08:49,298 --> 01:08:51,306
我来罗新斯只是为了见你
I came to Rosings only to see you.

854
01:08:51,473 --> 01:08:54,643
理智的想法和家族的期望阻挠着我
I have fought against judgement, my family's expectation,

855
01:08:54,851 --> 01:08:57,687
你卑微的出身和我爵位的悬殊也令我迟疑不决
the inferiority of your birth, my rank.

856
01:08:57,854 --> 01:09:00,482
但我要把这一切统统抛开，请你终结我的痛苦
I will put them aside and ask you to end my agony.

857
01:09:00,649 --> 01:09:03,818
- 我不明白你在说什么  - 我爱你
- I don't understand.  - I love you.

858
01:09:05,946 --> 01:09:08,323
最真挚的爱
Most ardently.

859
01:09:11,326 --> 01:09:15,497
请赐予我荣幸，接受我的手吧
Please do me the honour of accepting my hand.

860
01:09:16,915 --> 01:09:20,835
先生，我感激你的挣扎
Sir, I appreciate the struggle you have been through,

861
01:09:21,044 --> 01:09:23,588
很抱歉引起你的痛苦
and I am very sorry to have caused you pain.

862
01:09:23,797 --> 01:09:25,840
我完全是无心的
It was unconsciously done.

863
01:09:27,258 --> 01:09:29,052
- 这就是你的回复？  - 是的，先生
- Is this your reply?  - Yes, sir.

864
01:09:29,219 --> 01:09:31,930
- 你是在嘲笑我吗？  - 不
- Are you laughing at me?  - No.

865
01:09:32,097 --> 01:09:33,264
你是在拒绝我？
Are you rejecting me?

866
01:09:33,473 --> 01:09:39,020
我确信，你心中阶级的门槛会帮助你克服痛苦
I'm sure the feelings which hindered your regard will help you overcome it.

867
01:09:39,187 --> 01:09:42,357
我能否问问，为什么我竟会遭受如此无礼的拒绝？
Might I ask why with so little civility I am thus repulsed?

868
01:09:42,565 --> 01:09:43,868
那么我能否问问
I might enquire

869
01:09:43,869 --> 01:09:47,779
为什么你说喜欢我是违背了你自己的理智？
why you told me you liked me against your better judgement?

870
01:09:47,946 --> 01:09:48,683
若说我是无礼的
If I was uncivil,

871
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:50,240
那这就是我无礼的理由之一吧
then that is some excuse.

872
01:09:50,407 --> 01:09:53,410
- 但我还有别的理由  - 什么理由？
- But you know I have other reasons.  - What reasons?

873
01:09:53,576 --> 01:09:57,163
一个毁了我最亲爱的姐姐幸福的人
Do you think anything might tempt me to accept the man who has ruined

874
01:09:57,330 --> 01:10:00,500
怎么会打动我的心去爱他呢？
the happiness of a most beloved sister?

875
01:10:00,667 --> 01:10:05,380
你能否认你拆散了一对相爱的恋人
Do you deny that you separated a young couple who loved each other,

876
01:10:05,547 --> 01:10:07,924
让你的朋友被大家指责为朝三暮四
exposing your friend to censure for caprice

877
01:10:08,091 --> 01:10:10,927
让我的姐姐被大家嘲笑为奢望空想
and my sister to derision for disappointed hopes,

878
01:10:11,094 --> 01:10:13,138
让他们双方都受尽了痛苦？
involving them both in acute misery?

879
01:10:13,346 --> 01:10:16,766
- 我并不否认  - 你怎么能做出这样的事情？
- I do not deny it.  - How could you do it?

880
01:10:16,933 --> 01:10:19,811
我认为你姐姐觉得他无关紧要
I believed your sister indifferent to him.

881
01:10:19,978 --> 01:10:22,647
我觉得他的爱要比她更多
I realised his attachment was deeper than hers.

882
01:10:22,814 --> 01:10:23,815
那是因为她害羞！
That's because she's shy!

883
01:10:24,023 --> 01:10:26,651
我说服彬格莱认为，她的感觉并不强烈
Bingley was persuaded she didn't feel strongly.

884
01:10:26,818 --> 01:10:28,862
- 那都是你说的  - 我这样做是为了他好
- Because you suggested it.  - For his own good.

885
01:10:29,028 --> 01:10:31,865
我姐姐连对我都不吐露她的心声
My sister hardly shows her true feelings to me.

886
01:10:36,077 --> 01:10:38,621
我想你是担心她是看上了他的钱吧?
I suppose his fortune had some bearing?

887
01:10:38,830 --> 01:10:41,374
我无意使你姐姐难堪
I wouldn't do your sister the dishonour.

888
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:43,585
- 有迹象表明...  - 什么？
- It was suggested...  - What was?

889
01:10:43,751 --> 01:10:46,212
这门婚事明显是为了谋取利益的...
It was clear an advantageous marriage...

890
01:10:46,379 --> 01:10:48,756
- 我姐姐给你那种印象？  - 不！
- Did my sister give that impression?  - No!

891
01:10:48,965 --> 01:10:51,601
你姐姐没有, 然而你的家人...
No. There was, however, your family...

892
01:10:51,602 --> 01:10:53,052
你以为我们是为了攀高枝?
Our want of connection?

893
01:10:53,219 --> 01:10:55,680
- 不，比那更甚  - 怎样更甚，先生？
- No, it was more than that.  - How, sir?

894
01:10:55,889 --> 01:11:00,768
你母亲、你妹妹们还有你父亲有失身份的表现
The lack of propriety shown by your mother, younger sisters and your father.

895
01:11:04,189 --> 01:11:09,152
请原谅我，你和你姐姐当然没有
Forgive me. You and your sister I must exclude from this.

896
01:11:13,656 --> 01:11:15,450
那韦翰先生又是怎么回事？
And what about Mr Wickham?

897
01:11:17,702 --> 01:11:18,703
韦翰先生？
Mr Wickham?

898
01:11:18,912 --> 01:11:21,664
你对他的所作所为，又能给出什么借口？
What excuse can you give for your behaviour?

899
01:11:21,831 --> 01:11:23,457
你对他倒是十分关心
You take an eager interest.

900
01:11:23,458 --> 01:11:25,084
他告诉了我他的不幸遭遇
He told me of his misfortunes.

901
01:11:25,251 --> 01:11:27,921
- 哦，他的确太不幸啦  - 你毁了他
- Oh, they have been great.  - You ruin his chances

902
01:11:28,087 --> 01:11:30,298
现在还讥讽他
yet treat him with sarcasm.

903
01:11:30,465 --> 01:11:32,508
这就是你对我的看法?
So this is your opinion of me?

904
01:11:32,717 --> 01:11:33,930
谢谢，只怪我老老实实地
Thank you. Perhaps these offences

905
01:11:33,931 --> 01:11:36,137
把我以前一误再误、迟疑不决的原因说了出来
might have been overlooked

906
01:11:36,304 --> 01:11:37,689
所以伤害了你的自尊心
had not your pride been hurt

907
01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:40,600
否则你也许就不会计较我得罪你的这些地方了
by my scruples about our relationship.

908
01:11:40,808 --> 01:11:43,978
难道你指望我会为你那些微贱的亲戚而欢欣鼓舞吗？
I am to rejoice in the inferiority of your circumstances?

909
01:11:44,145 --> 01:11:46,814
这像是个绅士说的话吗?
And those are the words of a gentleman.

910
01:11:46,981 --> 01:11:51,694
你十足狂妄自大、自私自利、看不起别人
Your arrogance and conceit, your selfish disdain for the feelings of others

911
01:11:51,861 --> 01:11:53,189
我早就想好了
made me realise

912
01:11:53,190 --> 01:11:57,617
哪怕天下男人都死光了，我也不愿意嫁给你
you were the last man in the world I could ever marry.

913
01:12:09,003 --> 01:12:13,883
请原谅，小姐，耽搁了你这么多时间
Forgive me, madam, for taking up so much of your time.

914
01:14:17,965 --> 01:14:20,092
我是来给你这个的
I came to leave you this.

915
01:14:30,478 --> 01:14:34,315
我不会再提起令你极度厌恶的感情
I shall not renew the sentiments which were so disgusting to you.

916
01:14:34,524 --> 01:14:38,778
但请允许我把你对我的两个误会也说清楚
But if I may, I will address the two offences you have laid against me.

917
01:14:45,368 --> 01:14:48,704
我父亲爱韦翰先生就像爱自己亲生儿子一样
My father loved Mr Wickham as a son.

918
01:14:48,913 --> 01:14:50,790
父亲留给他一个富裕的生活
He left him a generous living.

919
01:14:50,791 --> 01:14:52,667
但自从我父亲去世以后
But upon my father's death,

920
01:14:52,833 --> 01:14:57,463
韦翰先生就声称他无意去受圣职
Mr Wickham announced he had no intention of taking orders.

921
01:14:57,672 --> 01:14:59,157
他要了等值的财产
He demanded the value of the living,

922
01:14:59,158 --> 01:15:03,427
然后把他的身家在数周内全部挥霍豪赌输光了
which he'd gambled away within weeks.

923
01:15:05,763 --> 01:15:08,933
然后他就写信给我要更多的钱，遭到我的断然拒绝
He then wrote, demanding more money, which I refused.

924
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:12,186
从那以后，与他的联系就完全中断了
After which, he severed all acquaintance.

925
01:15:12,395 --> 01:15:14,584
去年夏天，他回来找我们
He came back to see us last summer,

926
01:15:14,585 --> 01:15:16,774
表示对我妹妹强烈爱慕
and declared passionate love for my sister,

927
01:15:16,941 --> 01:15:20,861
我妹妹竟被他打动了心，答应要跟他私奔
whom he tried to persuade to elope with him.

928
01:15:21,028 --> 01:15:24,699
妹妹她将会继承三万英镑的遗产
She is to inherit ￡30, 000.

929
01:15:24,865 --> 01:15:28,410
但他得知自己从中得不到一个便士时
When it was made clear he would never receive a penny of it,

930
01:15:28,411 --> 01:15:30,288
他马上就消失了
he disappeared.

931
01:15:30,454 --> 01:15:34,125
无须赘言，当时的乔治安娜何等失望
I will not attempt to convey the depth of Georgiana's despair.

932
01:15:34,333 --> 01:15:37,420
当时她才15岁
She was 15 years old.

933
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:43,050
至于另外一件事，关于你姐姐和彬格莱先生
As to the other matter, of your sister and Mr Bingley,

934
01:15:43,259 --> 01:15:46,762
虽然我去干涉的动机不够充分
though the motives which governed me may appear insufficient,

935
01:15:46,971 --> 01:15:50,307
但那是我作为他的朋友的一种义务
they were in the service of a friend.

936
01:15:50,474 --> 01:15:52,518
伊丽莎白
Lizzie.

937
01:15:55,730 --> 01:15:57,606
你还好么？
Are you all right?

938
01:15:57,815 --> 01:16:01,152
我自己也不知道
I hardly know.

939
01:16:09,243 --> 01:16:12,246
伊丽莎白，你现在能赶回来真是时候
Lizzie. How fortunate you have arrived.

940
01:16:12,455 --> 01:16:16,125
你的舅舅和舅母把吉英从伦敦送回来了
Your aunt and uncle are here to deliver Jane from London.

941
01:16:16,292 --> 01:16:19,628
- 吉英怎样了？  - 她现在在客厅
- How is Jane?  - She's in the drawing room.

942
01:16:22,256 --> 01:16:24,158
我已经完全忘却他了
I'm quite over him.

943
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:28,345
就算在街上和他擦肩而过，我都不会去注意
If he passed me in the street, I'd hardly notice.

944
01:16:28,554 --> 01:16:32,391
伦敦充满了各种各样有趣的事物，这是真的
London is so diverting. It's true.

945
01:16:34,185 --> 01:16:36,854
那里有很多消遣
There's so much to entertain.

946
01:16:42,568 --> 01:16:44,528
在肯特郡，有什么消息啊？
What news from Kent?

947
01:16:46,530 --> 01:16:48,407
没什么
Nothing.

948
01:16:50,075 --> 01:16:52,286
起码没有什么可以让我消遣的
At least not much to entertain.

949
01:16:52,453 --> 01:16:54,246
伊丽莎白，告诉妈妈！
Lizzie, tell Mama!

950
01:16:54,455 --> 01:16:57,124
不要再小题大做了
Stop making such a fuss.

951
01:16:57,291 --> 01:16:59,540
为什么费斯托太太不把我也邀请上?
Why didn't she ask me as well?

952
01:16:59,541 --> 01:17:01,128
因为我是个更好的同伴
Because I'm better company.

953
01:17:01,337 --> 01:17:03,881
- 怎么回事？  - 我更合适
- What's the matter?  - I've just as much right.

954
01:17:04,048 --> 01:17:06,258
让我们都去吧
Let's all go.

955
01:17:06,425 --> 01:17:09,386
丽迪雅被邀请去与费斯托家一同去布莱顿
Lydia's been invited to Brighton with the Forsters.

956
01:17:09,553 --> 01:17:11,597
在海中沐浴将会使我更加美丽
Sea-bathing would set me up nicely.

957
01:17:11,764 --> 01:17:14,058
我可以和军官们每晚一起共进晚餐
I shall dine with the officers every night.

958
01:17:14,225 --> 01:17:16,185
爸爸，不要让她去
Papa, don't let her go.

959
01:17:16,393 --> 01:17:19,837
丽迪雅不到公共场所之类的地方去出一出丑
Lydia will never be easy

960
01:17:19,838 --> 01:17:21,106
是决不肯罢休的
until she'sexposed herself in some public place.

961
01:17:21,273 --> 01:17:22,255
她这次要去出丑
And we could never expect her to do it

962
01:17:22,256 --> 01:17:25,819
既不必花家里的钱  又用不着家里麻烦
with so little inconvenience.

963
01:17:26,028 --> 01:17:28,072
如果爸爸你不制止她
If you do not check her,

964
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:30,636
她会被挂上愚蠢的卖俏者的花名
she'll be fixed as the silliest flirt

965
01:17:30,637 --> 01:17:32,993
弄得我们全家都惹人笑话的
who ever made her family ridiculous.

966
01:17:33,202 --> 01:17:34,995
吉蒂也会一如既往地有样学样
And Kitty will follow, as always.

967
01:17:35,204 --> 01:17:40,084
伊丽莎白，如果不让她去，我们将不得安宁
Lizzie, we shall have no peace until she goes.

968
01:17:40,251 --> 01:17:43,587
原来这才是你关心的？
Is that really all you care about?

969
01:17:43,754 --> 01:17:47,341
费斯托上校是个有见识的人
Colonel Forster is a sensible man.

970
01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:50,344
他不会让她闯出什么祸事来的
He will keep her out of any real mischief.

971
01:17:50,511 --> 01:17:53,347
她太穷，谁也不会看中她
And she's too poor to be an object of prey to anyone.

972
01:17:53,514 --> 01:17:54,682
爸爸，但是这样做很危险
It's dangerous.

973
01:17:54,890 --> 01:17:59,436
我肯定军官们会找到更中意的对象
I am certain the officers will find women better worth their while.

974
01:18:00,521 --> 01:18:04,358
我们但愿她去了布莱顿以后
Let us hope, in fact, that her stay in Brighton

975
01:18:04,567 --> 01:18:09,363
能意识到自己有多么渺小
will teach her her own insignificance.

976
01:18:09,572 --> 01:18:12,199
她再坏也坏不到哪里去
At any rate, she can hardly grow any worse.

977
01:18:12,366 --> 01:18:16,912
如果她真不行的话，我们就把她一辈子关在家里
If she does, we'd be obliged to lock her up for the rest of her life.

978
01:18:26,171 --> 01:18:28,799
伊丽莎白，我们希望你和我们一起去
Lizzie, you're welcome to accompany us.

979
01:18:28,966 --> 01:18:30,926
山顶区不同于布莱顿
The Peak District is not Brighton.

980
01:18:31,135 --> 01:18:34,638
陆军军官都挺消瘦的，这可能会改变你的决定
Officers are thin on the ground which may influence your decision.

981
01:18:34,847 --> 01:18:36,318
和我们一同去山区吧
Come to the Peak District with us,

982
01:18:36,319 --> 01:18:38,934
伊丽莎白，去呼吸一下新鲜空气
Lizzie, and get some fresh air.

983
01:18:39,101 --> 01:18:42,688
大自然的风光，人和山石岂可同日而语?
The glories of nature. What are men compared to rocks and mountains?

984
01:18:42,896 --> 01:18:46,066
男人大多或傲慢或愚蠢
Men are either eaten up with arrogance or stupidity.

985
01:18:46,233 --> 01:18:49,570
和蔼可亲的，必定又是没有主见
If they are amiable, they have no minds of their own.

986
01:18:49,778 --> 01:18:51,209
注意你的言语，我亲爱的
Take care, my love.

987
01:18:51,210 --> 01:18:53,032
你这句话充满了苦涩的味道
That savours strongly of bitterness.

988
01:19:00,039 --> 01:19:04,293
在罗新斯的时候，我见到了达西先生
I saw Mr Darcy when I was at Rosings.

989
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:06,045
你为什么不告诉我？
Why did you not tell me?

990
01:19:08,672 --> 01:19:11,133
他提到了彬格莱先生吗？
Did he mention Mr Bingley?

991
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:14,678
没有
No.

992
01:19:19,099 --> 01:19:21,477
他一句也没提
No, he did not.

993
01:20:25,207 --> 01:20:28,710
噢，人岂可与山石同日而语
Oh, what are men compared to rocks and mountains?

994
01:20:28,877 --> 01:20:32,381
或者马车可以？
Or carriages that work?

995
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:38,804
我们现在具体是在那里？
Where exactly are we?

996
01:20:39,012 --> 01:20:41,390
离彭伯里相当近
I think we are quite close to Pemberley.

997
01:20:43,141 --> 01:20:45,602
- 达西先生的家？  - 就是他
- Mr Darcy's home?  - That's the fellow.

998
01:20:45,769 --> 01:20:49,439
真是一个富饶的湖区  我真的很想去看看
Very well-stocked lake. I've a hankering to see it.

999
01:20:49,606 --> 01:20:50,691
噢，不要，我们不要去
Oh, no, let's not.

1000
01:20:54,236 --> 01:20:56,446
他太...
Well, he's so...

1001
01:20:56,655 --> 01:21:00,242
我不打算去，因为他太...他太...
I'd rather not, he's so... he's so...

1002
01:21:00,409 --> 01:21:02,119
- 他怎么了？  - 他太富有了
- So what?  - So rich.

1003
01:21:02,286 --> 01:21:05,455
我的天，伊丽莎白，你还真是势利啊！
By heavens, Lizzie, what a snob you are!

1004
01:21:05,622 --> 01:21:07,499
因为达西先生富有就反感他
Objecting to Mr Darcy because of his wealth.

1005
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:09,376
可怜的他一定很无奈
The poor man can't help it.

1006
01:21:09,585 --> 01:21:11,470
他不会在那里的
He won't be there anyway.

1007
01:21:11,471 --> 01:21:15,007
这些人从来都不会呆在家里的
These great men are never at home.

1008
01:22:19,321 --> 01:22:20,697
跟上
Keep up.

1009
01:22:41,134 --> 01:22:43,205
您的主人在家的日子多吗？
Is your master much at home?

1010
01:22:43,206 --> 01:22:44,888
并没有我所期盼的那么多
Not as much as I would wish.

1011
01:22:45,097 --> 01:22:47,557
但他绝对喜欢这里
He dearly loves it here.

1012
01:22:47,724 --> 01:22:51,478
要是你主人结了婚，你见到他的时候就会多些
If he should marry, you might see more of him.

1013
01:23:00,028 --> 01:23:02,906
他与他父亲真的很像
He's a lot like his father.

1014
01:23:07,369 --> 01:23:11,832
我丈夫病了的时候，达西先生都忙不过来
When my husband was ill, Mr Darcy couldn't do enough.

1015
01:23:16,169 --> 01:23:20,257
但他马上为我安排了仆人
He just organised the servants for me.

1016
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:38,733
这就是他，达西先生
This is he, Mr Darcy.

1017
01:23:39,985 --> 01:23:42,112
英俊的面庞
A handsome face.

1018
01:23:42,779 --> 01:23:46,533
伊丽莎白，这像他么？
Lizzie, is it a true likeness?

1019
01:23:46,741 --> 01:23:50,161
这位年轻的小姐原来跟达西先生相熟？
Does the young lady know Mr Darcy?

1020
01:23:50,328 --> 01:23:52,622
不太熟
Only a little.

1021
01:23:52,831 --> 01:23:56,918
你不觉得他是位英俊的少爷吗，小姐？
Do you not think him a handsome man, miss?

1022
01:23:57,085 --> 01:23:58,503
是的，很英俊
Yes.

1023
01:24:01,089 --> 01:24:03,300
是的，我敢说他是英俊的
Yes, I dare say he is.

1024
01:24:06,845 --> 01:24:09,764
这是他的妹妹，乔治安娜小姐
This is his sister, Miss Georgiana.

1025
01:24:10,223 --> 01:24:13,893
她成天弹琴唱歌
She sings and plays all day long.

1026
01:24:16,146 --> 01:24:18,607
她现在在家么？
Is she at home?

1027
01:26:24,399 --> 01:26:25,859
伊丽莎白小姐
Miss Elizabeth.

1028
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:41,749
- 我以为你在伦敦  - 不
- I thought you were in London.  - No.

1029
01:26:41,916 --> 01:26:44,210
不，我不在伦敦
No, I'm not.

1030
01:26:44,377 --> 01:26:46,087
不在
No.

1031
01:26:46,254 --> 01:26:48,191
我们不会来的，要是知道...
We would not have come...

1032
01:26:48,192 --> 01:26:49,591
我提早一天回来了...
I came back a day early...

1033
01:26:55,388 --> 01:26:56,806
我与我的舅舅和舅母一起来的
I'm with my aunt and uncle.

1034
01:26:59,517 --> 01:27:01,561
你们的旅途愉快么？
And are you having a pleasant trip?

1035
01:27:01,728 --> 01:27:04,355
非常开心
Very pleasant.

1036
01:27:04,522 --> 01:27:08,026
- 我们明天就去马特洛克  - 明天？
- Tomorrow we go to Matlock.  - Tomorrow?

1037
01:27:09,903 --> 01:27:11,546
你们是住在兰顿吗？
Are you staying at Lambton?

1038
01:27:11,547 --> 01:27:13,072
是的，在玫瑰花冠旅馆
Yes, at the Rose and Crown.

1039
01:27:13,281 --> 01:27:15,325
这样啊
Yes.

1040
01:27:19,078 --> 01:27:20,705
非常抱歉，闯入你的家
I'm so sorry to intrude.

1041
01:27:20,914 --> 01:27:24,959
舅舅他们说这是对游客开放的，我自己不清楚
They said the house was open for visitors. I had no idea.

1042
01:27:28,963 --> 01:27:31,341
- 我可以送你回村庄去吗？  - 不用
- May I see you back to the village?  - No.

1043
01:27:34,927 --> 01:27:37,388
- 我非常喜欢徒步行走  - 是的
- I'm very fond of walking.  - Yes.

1044
01:27:39,515 --> 01:27:41,142
是的，我知道
Yes, I know.

1045
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:48,358
再见，达西先生
Goodbye, Mr Darcy.

1046
01:28:06,084 --> 01:28:08,544
这边请，先生
This way, sir.

1047
01:28:14,550 --> 01:28:16,678
你真的不和我们一起吃饭吗？
Are you sure you wouldn't like to join us?

1048
01:28:29,774 --> 01:28:31,201
我们刚才才见到达西先生
We've just met Mr Darcy.

1049
01:28:31,202 --> 01:28:33,277
你没有告诉过我们你曾经见过他
You didn't tell us that you'd seen him.

1050
01:28:33,486 --> 01:28:35,590
他邀请我们与他明天一同吃顿便饭
He's asked us to dine with him tomorrow.

1051
01:28:35,591 --> 01:28:38,116
他是一个很有礼貌的人, 不是吗？
He was very civil, was he not?

1052
01:28:38,282 --> 01:28:40,827
- 非常有礼貌  - 他一点都不像你说的那样
- Very civil.  - Not at all how you'd painted him.

1053
01:28:41,035 --> 01:28:42,370
和他吃饭？
To dine with him?

1054
01:28:42,537 --> 01:28:46,916
他说话的样子，让人感觉很愉快
There's something pleasant about his mouth when he speaks.

1055
01:28:47,083 --> 01:28:50,002
你不介意这样会延误行程吧？
You don't mind delaying our journey another day?

1056
01:28:50,169 --> 01:28:53,756
他特别点名要你去，见见他的妹妹
He particularly wants you to meet his sister.

1057
01:28:53,923 --> 01:28:55,633
他的妹妹
His sister.

1058
01:29:24,203 --> 01:29:26,247
伊丽莎白小姐！
Miss Elizabeth!

1059
01:29:30,877 --> 01:29:32,837
我的妹妹，乔治安娜
My sister, Miss Georgiana.

1060
01:29:33,045 --> 01:29:35,173
我哥哥给我讲了很多关于你的事情
My brother has told me so much about you,

1061
01:29:35,381 --> 01:29:38,384
- 我觉得我们俩就像老朋友一样  - 谢谢
- I feel as if we are friends already.  - Thank you.

1062
01:29:38,551 --> 01:29:41,888
- 钢琴真漂亮  - 我哥哥给我的
- What a beautiful pianoforte.  - My brother gave it to me.

1063
01:29:42,096 --> 01:29:44,056
- 他不应该给我的  - 当然应该给
- He shouldn't have.  - I should have.

1064
01:29:44,223 --> 01:29:47,476
- 好吧  - 她真容易被说服，不是么？
- Very well then.  - Easily persuaded, is she not?

1065
01:29:48,603 --> 01:29:51,522
你哥哥曾不得不整晚听着我演奏糟糕的钢琴
He once had to put up with my playing.

1066
01:29:51,689 --> 01:29:56,402
- 但他说你弹得非常好  - 那是他的自欺
- He says you play so well.  - Then he has perjured himself.

1067
01:29:56,569 --> 01:29:57,927
我是说“挺好的”
I said "quite well".

1068
01:29:57,928 --> 01:29:59,739
是“挺好的”，不是“非常好”
"Quite well" is not "very well".

1069
01:29:59,906 --> 01:30:01,616
这样我就满意了
I'm satisfied.

1070
01:30:07,872 --> 01:30:10,791
- 嘉丁纳先生，你喜欢钓鱼吗  - 非常喜欢
- Mr Gardiner, are you fond of fishing?  - Very much.

1071
01:30:10,958 --> 01:30:13,753
今天下午你有兴趣陪我一起去湖边钓鱼吗?
Would you accompany me to the lake this afternoon?

1072
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:16,464
湖边的居民已经离开很长一段时间了
Its occupants have been left in peace too long.

1073
01:30:16,631 --> 01:30:18,035
乐意之至
I would be delighted.

1074
01:30:18,036 --> 01:30:20,843
你会二重奏吗，伊丽莎白小姐？
Do you play duets, Miss Elizabeth?

1075
01:30:21,010 --> 01:30:26,223
- 除非迫不得已  - 哥哥，你可得要强迫她
- Only when forced.  - Brother, you must force her.

1076
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:30,186
钓鱼棒极了，很好的同伴，小伙子真不错
Splendid fishing, good company. What a capital fellow.

1077
01:30:30,353 --> 01:30:33,356
太感谢你了，达西先生
Thank you so much, Mr Darcy.

1078
01:30:35,358 --> 01:30:37,485
你的一封信，小姐
A letter for you, madam.

1079
01:30:37,652 --> 01:30:39,528
噢，是来自吉英的
Oh, it's from Jane.

1080
01:31:04,053 --> 01:31:06,180
这真是最可怕不过的消息了
It is the most dreadful news.

1081
01:31:08,641 --> 01:31:10,851
丽迪雅逃走了...
Lydia has run away...

1082
01:31:13,729 --> 01:31:15,523
...和韦翰先生一起
...with Mr Wickham.

1083
01:31:15,690 --> 01:31:17,566
天知道他们去哪了
They are gone to Lord knows where.

1084
01:31:17,733 --> 01:31:23,739
她没钱没势，恐怕再也找不着她了
She has no money, no connections. I fear she is lost forever.

1085
01:31:27,284 --> 01:31:29,161
这是我的错
This is my fault.

1086
01:31:29,370 --> 01:31:32,873
当初我要是揭露韦翰的真面目就好了
If only I had exposed Wickham when I should.

1087
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:36,043
不，这是我的错
No, this is my fault.

1088
01:31:36,252 --> 01:31:39,505
如果我当初告诉我妹妹  就可以阻止这一切的发生
I might have prevented all this by being open with my sisters.

1089
01:31:40,464 --> 01:31:43,467
有人去找她了吗？
Has anything been done to recover her?

1090
01:31:43,676 --> 01:31:48,722
我父亲去了伦敦，但我知道也于事无补
My father has gone to London, but I know nothing can be done.

1091
01:31:50,724 --> 01:31:53,561
我们实在不敢存一线希望
We have not the smallest hope.

1092
01:31:53,727 --> 01:31:55,604
希望我能帮你
Would I could help you.

1093
01:31:55,771 --> 01:31:57,982
先生，我想已经来不及了
Sir, I think it is too late.

1094
01:32:01,735 --> 01:32:05,739
这真令人伤心，我得离开了，告辞
This is grave indeed. I will leave you. Goodbye.

1095
01:32:05,906 --> 01:32:07,867
我们要马上启程
We must go at once.

1096
01:32:08,033 --> 01:32:09,323
在丽迪雅毁掉这个家以前
I will join Mr Bennet and find Lydia

1097
01:32:09,324 --> 01:32:11,787
我会去找班纳特先生，和他一同寻找丽迪雅
before she ruins the family.

1098
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:44,320
费斯托夫妇怎么竟放心让她离开他们跟前呢？
Why did the Forsters let her out of their sight?

1099
01:32:44,486 --> 01:32:47,656
我一直觉得他们不适合照管她
I always said they were unfit to take charge of her.

1100
01:32:47,865 --> 01:32:49,616
现在，她已经被糟蹋了
And now she is ruined.

1101
01:32:49,617 --> 01:32:51,118
你们的声名都被玷污了
You are all ruined.

1102
01:32:51,327 --> 01:32:56,707
有这样一个堕落的妹妹，现在谁会要你们？
Who will take you now with a fallen sister?

1103
01:32:56,874 --> 01:33:00,377
可怜的班纳特先生不得不和背信弃义的韦翰决斗
Poor Mr Bennet will now have to fight the perfidious Wickham

1104
01:33:00,586 --> 01:33:02,129
他一定会被韦翰活活打死
and then be killed.

1105
01:33:02,296 --> 01:33:04,173
爸爸还没有找到他，妈妈
He hasn't found him yet, Mama.

1106
01:33:04,381 --> 01:33:07,176
他尸骨未寒，柯林斯先生就会把我们撵出去
Mr Collins will turn us out before he is cold.

1107
01:33:07,343 --> 01:33:11,263
别那么惊慌，舅舅正在伦敦帮忙寻找着呢
Do not be so alarmed. Our uncle is in London helping in the search.

1108
01:33:11,472 --> 01:33:16,685
丽迪雅分明知道这样做对我的神经有多大损害
Lydia must know what this must be doing to my nerves.

1109
01:33:16,894 --> 01:33:22,107
我现在全身发抖，抽筋！
Such flutterings and spasms all over me!

1110
01:33:23,984 --> 01:33:27,821
我亲爱的宝贝丽迪雅, 我的小宝宝！
My baby Lydia, my baby!

1111
01:33:28,030 --> 01:33:32,534
她怎么能对可怜的妈妈做出这种事情？
How could she do such a thing to her poor mama?

1112
01:33:33,661 --> 01:33:36,121
- 你不能这样做！  - 别孩子气了
- You can't do that!  - Don't be such a baby.

1113
01:33:36,330 --> 01:33:38,999
- 吉蒂，给我  - 这是给谁的？
- Kitty, give it to me.  - Who's it for?

1114
01:33:39,166 --> 01:33:40,793
地址上写的是给爸爸的
It's addressed to Papa.

1115
01:33:42,294 --> 01:33:44,296
这是舅舅的笔迹
It's in Uncle's writing.

1116
01:33:44,713 --> 01:33:47,257
爸爸，有一封信
Papa, there's a letter.

1117
01:33:47,424 --> 01:33:50,844
- 先让我喘口气  - 是舅舅的笔迹
- Let me catch my breath.  - It's in Uncle's writing.

1118
01:33:55,391 --> 01:33:57,601
- 他找到他们了  - 他们结婚了么？
- He's found them.  - Are they married?

1119
01:33:57,768 --> 01:34:00,229
- 我看不清他写什么  - 给我
- I can't make out his script.  - Give it to me.

1120
01:34:00,437 --> 01:34:01,689
他们结婚了么？
Are they married?

1121
01:34:01,855 --> 01:34:05,054
如果父亲每年给她一百镑，他们就结婚
They will be if Father settles ￡100 a year on her.

1122
01:34:05,055 --> 01:34:06,402
这是他的条件
That is his condition.

1123
01:34:06,568 --> 01:34:09,405
- 你会接受吗, 父亲？  - 当然
- You will agree to this, Father?  - Of course.

1124
01:34:09,571 --> 01:34:13,951
天知道你舅舅一定在那个卑鄙的人身上花了不少钱
God knows how much your uncle must've laid on that wretched man.

1125
01:34:14,159 --> 01:34:15,327
你是什么意思？
What do you mean?

1126
01:34:15,494 --> 01:34:17,371
没人会为了每年区区一百镑
No man would marry Lydia

1127
01:34:17,579 --> 01:34:21,750
去娶丽迪雅的
under so slight a temptation as ￡100 a year.

1128
01:34:21,917 --> 01:34:24,586
你舅舅肯定花了不少钱
Your uncle must've been very generous.

1129
01:34:25,504 --> 01:34:27,881
你说，总数会是一个大数目么？
Do you think it a large sum?

1130
01:34:28,048 --> 01:34:29,972
韦翰要是没拿到一万镑就答应娶丽迪雅
Wickham's a fool

1131
01:34:29,973 --> 01:34:31,218
那他才是个大傻瓜呢
if he accepts less than ￡10,000.

1132
01:34:31,427 --> 01:34:34,221
- 天地不容！  - 父亲！
- Heaven forbid!  - Father!

1133
01:34:35,848 --> 01:34:40,310
丽迪雅结婚了，而且才15岁！
Lydia married and at 15 too!

1134
01:34:40,519 --> 01:34:42,396
去拉铃，吉蒂
Ring the bell, Kitty.

1135
01:34:42,604 --> 01:34:45,374
我要穿好衣服去告诉卢卡斯女士这个消息
I must put on my things and tell Lady Lucas.

1136
01:34:45,375 --> 01:34:47,067
噢，看看她会是什么表情
Oh, to see her face.

1137
01:34:47,276 --> 01:34:49,987
告诉仆人们，他们将会有一大碗桃子
Tell the servants they will have a bowl of punch.

1138
01:34:50,154 --> 01:34:52,948
- 我们应该去感谢舅舅  - 他应该帮忙的
- We should thank our uncle.  - So he should help.

1139
01:34:53,115 --> 01:34:56,618
他比我们有钱得多，又没有孩子。女儿出嫁咯！
He's far richer than us and has no children. Daughter married!

1140
01:34:56,785 --> 01:34:58,746
那就是你关心的？
Is that really all you think about?

1141
01:34:58,912 --> 01:35:02,833
当你有五个女儿的时候，你再告诉我你的想法
When you have five daughters, tell me what else will occupy your thoughts.

1142
01:35:03,041 --> 01:35:04,835
到那时，可能你就理解了
Then perhaps you'll understand.

1143
01:35:06,170 --> 01:35:09,006
你根本连他是个什么人都不知道
You don't know what he's like.

1144
01:35:09,965 --> 01:35:12,593
- 丽迪雅！  - 噢，妈妈！
- Lydia!  - Oh, Mama!

1145
01:35:16,763 --> 01:35:18,724
我们与莎拉·辛的车擦肩而过
We passed Sarah Sims in her carriage.

1146
01:35:18,932 --> 01:35:22,769
我就脱下手套，好让她看到我的戒指
So I took off my glove so she might see the ring.

1147
01:35:22,978 --> 01:35:25,898
然后我弯腰大笑，就像...
Then I bowed and smiled like anything...

1148
01:35:26,064 --> 01:35:30,694
我相信她连你一半的风光都没有，我亲爱的
I'm sure she was not half as radiant as you, my dear.

1149
01:35:30,861 --> 01:35:32,988
你们一定得去去布莱顿
You must all go to Brighton.

1150
01:35:33,197 --> 01:35:34,714
那里才是个找丈夫的地方
That is the place to get husbands.

1151
01:35:34,715 --> 01:35:36,783
但愿你们有我一半好运就好啦
I hope you have half my good luck.

1152
01:35:36,992 --> 01:35:38,452
丽迪雅
Lydia.

1153
01:35:38,619 --> 01:35:42,831
我要知道每一个细节，丽迪雅，亲爱的
I want to hear every little detail, Lydia, dear.

1154
01:35:42,998 --> 01:35:46,001
我在北英格兰被应征入伍
I've been enlisted in a regiment in the North of England.

1155
01:35:46,168 --> 01:35:47,794
那真好
Glad to hear it.

1156
01:35:47,961 --> 01:35:51,215
在纽卡斯尔附近，我们下个星期就会去那里
Near Newcastle.  We travel there next week.

1157
01:35:51,381 --> 01:35:55,427
- 我能和你们一起去吗？  - 问都不要问
- Can I come and stay with you?  - That is out of the question.

1158
01:35:55,594 --> 01:35:58,430
星期一到了，我还在大惊小怪
Monday morning came and I was in such a fuss.

1159
01:35:58,597 --> 01:35:59,765
我一点也不想听
I don't want to hear.

1160
01:35:59,932 --> 01:36:03,518
舅母一直不住嘴地讲呀，说呀，好像是在传道似的
There was my aunt preaching away as if reading a sermon.

1161
01:36:03,727 --> 01:36:07,397
- 她很不高兴  - 你知道为什么吗？
- She was horrid unpleasant.  - Can't you understand why?

1162
01:36:07,606 --> 01:36:09,024
但我一个字都听不进
But I didn't hear a word

1163
01:36:09,025 --> 01:36:11,860
因为我满脑子都在惦记我亲爱的韦翰
because I was thinking of my dear Wickham.

1164
01:36:12,027 --> 01:36:14,696
我一心想要知道，他会不会穿着那件蓝制服结婚
I longed to know if he'd be married in his bluecoat.

1165
01:36:14,863 --> 01:36:19,409
北英格兰，我相信那里会有很多壮观的景色的
The North of England, I believe, boasts some spectacular scenery.

1166
01:36:19,576 --> 01:36:21,494
所以我想，如果他不能回来
So I thought, who is to be our best man

1167
01:36:21,495 --> 01:36:23,413
谁来做我们的傧相呢？
if he doesn't come back?

1168
01:36:23,622 --> 01:36:27,209
幸好，他回来了，否则我就请达西先生做傧相了
Lucky, he did, or I would've had to ask Mr Darcy.

1169
01:36:27,376 --> 01:36:31,755
- 达西先生！  - 我怎么完全忘了！
- Mr Darcy!  - I forgot!

1170
01:36:31,922 --> 01:36:33,754
这事我应该一字不提才对
But I shouldn't have said a word.

1171
01:36:33,755 --> 01:36:35,342
达西先生在你的婚礼上？
Mr Darcy was at your wedding?

1172
01:36:35,509 --> 01:36:38,428
就是他找到我们的
He was the one that discovered us.

1173
01:36:38,595 --> 01:36:43,392
他给了婚礼的费用和韦翰在军队的委托金等所有费用
He paid for the wedding, Wickham's commission, everything.

1174
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,477
但是他告诉我要我保密
But he told me not to tell.

1175
01:36:46,645 --> 01:36:49,106
- 达西先生？  - 不要这样, 伊丽莎白
- Mr Darcy?  - Stop it, Lizzie.

1176
01:36:50,232 --> 01:36:54,277
有时，达西先生还没你这么盛气凌人呢
Mr Darcy's not half as high and mighty as you sometimes.

1177
01:36:59,908 --> 01:37:02,995
吉蒂，看过我的戒指了么？
Kitty, have you seen my ring?

1178
01:37:03,203 --> 01:37:05,330
多给我写写信吧，亲爱的
Write to me often, my dear.

1179
01:37:05,539 --> 01:37:08,625
结了婚的女人是没有什么工夫写信的
Married women never have much time for writing.

1180
01:37:08,792 --> 01:37:10,669
我相信你没有
I dare say you won't.

1181
01:37:10,877 --> 01:37:15,841
当年我嫁给你爸爸的时候，时间根本不够用
When I married your father, there didn't seem to be enough hours in the day.

1182
01:37:17,509 --> 01:37:22,389
姐姐们倒可以写信给我，反正她们也没事做
My sisters may write to me, for they'll have nothing else to do.

1183
01:37:29,521 --> 01:37:33,567
同自己的孩子离别，真是再难受不过的事
There's nothing so bad as parting with one's children.

1184
01:37:34,568 --> 01:37:38,405
他们走了，我好像失去了归宿
One seems so forlorn without them.

1185
01:37:42,826 --> 01:37:47,956
- 再见  - 再见，丽迪雅，再见，韦翰先生
- Goodbye.  - Goodbye, Lydia. Goodbye, Mr Wickham.

1186
01:37:49,583 --> 01:37:52,210
再见，吉蒂。再见，爸爸
Bye, Kitty. Bye, Papa.

1187
01:37:58,133 --> 01:38:01,303
真难想象这么多的墨水你爸爸以后怎么用得完
I can't imagine what your father does with all that ink.

1188
01:38:01,511 --> 01:38:03,388
班纳特夫人
Mrs Bennet.

1189
01:38:04,473 --> 01:38:09,186
你听说了吗？彬格莱先生要回尼日斐花园了
Did you hear the news, madam? Mr Bingley is returning to Netherfield.

1190
01:38:09,352 --> 01:38:13,482
尼可斯夫人订了猪肉，打算明天招待他
Mrs Nichols is ordering a haunch of pork. She expects him tomorrow.

1191
01:38:13,648 --> 01:38:16,026
明天？
Tomorrow?

1192
01:38:16,234 --> 01:38:18,779
我关心的不是他，彬格莱对我们来说算不了什么
Not that I care.  Mr Bingley's nothing to us.

1193
01:38:18,987 --> 01:38:22,240
我永远都不想再见到他，再也不
I'm sure I never want to see him again, no.

1194
01:38:22,407 --> 01:38:26,787
我们不应该提起这个事情。他确定要回来了吗？
We shan't mention a word about it. Is it quite certain he's coming?

1195
01:38:26,995 --> 01:38:29,841
是的，夫人，我想他是一个人来
Yes, madam. I believe he's alone.

1196
01:38:29,842 --> 01:38:31,875
他的妹妹还在城里
His sister remains in town.

1197
01:38:33,877 --> 01:38:37,470
为什么他会认为我们有兴趣，我不知道
Why he thinks we should be interested, I've no idea.

1198
01:38:37,471 --> 01:38:38,840
跟我来，孩子们
Come along, girls.

1199
01:38:39,799 --> 01:38:44,095
我们最好现在马上回家告诉班纳特老爷
We better go home at once and tell Mr Bennet.

1200
01:38:44,262 --> 01:38:48,183
真是厚颜无耻，我在想他有没有胆量现身
The impudence of the man. I wonder he dare show his face.

1201
01:38:48,350 --> 01:38:50,393
没什么的，伊丽莎白
It's all right, Lizzie.

1202
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:51,641
他一个人来我真高兴
I'm just glad he's alone

1203
01:38:51,642 --> 01:38:53,563
因为这样我们就可以少点见到他
because we shall see less of him.

1204
01:38:53,730 --> 01:38:58,026
我不是怕自己会怎么样，但我怕人们又要说三道四
Not that I'm afraid of myself. But I dread other people's remarks.

1205
01:38:58,235 --> 01:38:59,861
噢, 对不起
Oh, I'm sorry.

1206
01:39:34,187 --> 01:39:36,481
他到了，他到了，他就在门口
He's here. He's here. He's at the door.

1207
01:39:37,607 --> 01:39:40,694
- 彬格莱先生！  - 彬格莱先生？
- Mr Bingley!  - Mr Bingley?

1208
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:43,863
噢，我的天啊！所有人都表现得自然点
Oh, my goodness! Everybody behave naturally.

1209
01:39:44,072 --> 01:39:46,700
无论怎样，都不要太傲慢
And whatever you do, do not appear overbearing.

1210
01:39:46,866 --> 01:39:48,444
还有一个人和他一起来
There's someone with him.

1211
01:39:48,445 --> 01:39:50,453
叫什么先生，一个自负的人
Mr Whatsisname, the pompous one.

1212
01:39:50,662 --> 01:39:52,646
达西先生？这个傲慢的家伙
Mr Darcy? The insolence of it.

1213
01:39:52,647 --> 01:39:55,292
他在想什么，他来这里干什么？
What does he think of, coming here?

1214
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:58,114
不要紧张，吉英，曼丽，把它拿开
Keep still, Jane. Mary, put that away at once.

1215
01:39:58,115 --> 01:40:00,380
做点有用的事情，帮帮忙
Find some useful employment.

1216
01:40:01,756 --> 01:40:05,427
天哪，我要保持冷静，要镇定，我一定要
Oh, my Lord, I shall have a seizure, I'm sure I shall.

1217
01:40:05,593 --> 01:40:07,554
吉蒂
Kitty.

1218
01:40:07,721 --> 01:40:09,848
这个不能放在这里
We can't have this here.

1219
01:40:09,849 --> 01:40:11,975
曼丽，那些丝带，丝带
Mary, the ribbons, the ribbons.

1220
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:18,189
曼丽，马上坐好，曼丽！
Mary, sit down at once. Mary!

1221
01:40:21,901 --> 01:40:26,364
达西先生和彬格莱先生到，夫人
Mr Darcy and Mr Bingley, ma'am.

1222
01:40:37,208 --> 01:40:39,919
真高兴能见到你，彬格莱先生
How glad we are to see you, Mr Bingley.

1223
01:40:40,086 --> 01:40:42,756
自从你走了以后，这一带发生了好多事情
There have been many changes since you went away.

1224
01:40:42,922 --> 01:40:45,489
卢卡斯小姐结婚了，有了归宿
Miss Lucas is married and settled.

1225
01:40:45,490 --> 01:40:47,886
我自己的一个女儿也出了嫁
And one of my own daughters too.

1226
01:40:48,053 --> 01:40:49,929
你可能在报纸上看到了吧
You will have seen it in the papers,

1227
01:40:50,138 --> 01:40:52,682
上面有消息，不过写得不成体统
though it was not put in as it ought to have been.

1228
01:40:52,891 --> 01:40:56,561
非常短，没有她家庭的介绍
Very short. Nothing about her family.

1229
01:40:56,728 --> 01:40:59,564
是的，我的确听说过。恭喜你们
Yes, I did hear of it. I offer my congratulations.

1230
01:40:59,731 --> 01:41:03,151
然而丽迪雅离开我身边，我又觉得难受
But it is very hard to have my Lydia taken away from me.

1231
01:41:03,359 --> 01:41:07,405
韦翰被调去纽卡斯尔
Mr Wickham has been transferred to Newcastle, wherever that is.

1232
01:41:07,572 --> 01:41:09,449
你会在乡下呆很长的时间么？
Will you stay long in the country?

1233
01:41:09,657 --> 01:41:11,868
只是几个星期，是来打猎的
Just a few weeks. For the shooting.

1234
01:41:12,076 --> 01:41:14,120
等你把你自己庄园里的鸟儿打完以后
When you've killed all your own birds,

1235
01:41:14,287 --> 01:41:15,897
请到班纳特老爷的庄园里来
I beg you will come here

1236
01:41:15,898 --> 01:41:17,373
你爱打多少就打多少
and shoot as many as you please.

1237
01:41:17,540 --> 01:41:19,650
我相信他一定非常乐意让你来
Mr Bennet will be vastly happy to oblige

1238
01:41:19,651 --> 01:41:22,086
而且会把最好的鹧鸪都留给你
and will save the best coveys for you.

1239
01:41:22,295 --> 01:41:24,756
太好了
Excellent.

1240
01:41:24,923 --> 01:41:28,843
- 你好吗，达西先生？  - 非常好，谢谢
- Are you well, Mr Darcy?  - Quite well, thank you.

1241
01:41:29,010 --> 01:41:31,387
我希望天气为你的捕猎保持晴朗
I hope the weather stays fine for your sport.

1242
01:41:31,554 --> 01:41:35,058
- 我明天就回城了  - 这么快？
- I return to town tomorrow.  - So soon?

1243
01:41:36,726 --> 01:41:41,272
我的吉英看起来不错吧，不是吗？
My Jane looks well, does she not?

1244
01:41:43,107 --> 01:41:45,235
她的确看起来很好
She does indeed.

1245
01:41:52,617 --> 01:41:55,370
好了，我想我们要走了
Well, we must be going, I think.

1246
01:41:56,079 --> 01:41:59,749
达西，能再次见到你们，我们感到高兴
Darcy. It's been very pleasant to see you all again.

1247
01:41:59,958 --> 01:42:01,918
伊丽莎白小姐，班纳特小姐
Miss Elizabeth. Miss Bennet.

1248
01:42:02,126 --> 01:42:03,503
你一定要再来
You must come again.

1249
01:42:03,670 --> 01:42:07,173
去年冬天，你答应要上我们这儿来吃顿便饭
Last winter, you promised to have
a family dinner with us.

1250
01:42:07,382 --> 01:42:10,451
你要知道，我一直都把这事放在心上
I've not forgot, you see.

1251
01:42:10,452 --> 01:42:12,178
至少三道主菜呢
At least three courses.

1252
01:42:17,976 --> 01:42:19,686
请原谅
Excuse me.

1253
01:42:25,525 --> 01:42:28,361
非常奇怪
Most extraordinary.

1254
01:42:39,455 --> 01:42:42,875
我们当时走进去，然后她说，“请坐”
We were going to walk in and she was going to say, "Sit down."

1255
01:42:43,084 --> 01:42:45,128
所以，我觉得...
So, I feel...

1256
01:42:55,596 --> 01:42:57,390
噢，这真是一场灾难！
Oh, it's a disaster, isn't it?

1257
01:42:57,598 --> 01:42:59,559
这是...
It's been...

1258
01:43:02,020 --> 01:43:04,147
- 班纳特小姐  - 彬格莱先生
- Miss Bennet.  - Mr Bingley.

1259
01:43:04,355 --> 01:43:07,150
我要直接走进去，然后说出来
I'll just go in and I'll just say it.

1260
01:43:07,317 --> 01:43:09,610
好，正是要这样
Yes, exactly.

1261
01:43:14,282 --> 01:43:15,305
我很高兴我们结束了
I'm glad that's over.

1262
01:43:15,306 --> 01:43:18,036
现在我们两个见面就像素不相识的两个人
Now we can meet as indifferent acquaintances.

1263
01:43:18,202 --> 01:43:19,203
哦，是哦
Oh, yes.

1264
01:43:19,412 --> 01:43:22,498
你可别以为我那么软弱，还会招来什么危险
You cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now.

1265
01:43:22,707 --> 01:43:26,544
我看你有极大的危险，会使他如痴如醉地爱你
You are in great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever.

1266
01:43:28,338 --> 01:43:31,747
真抱歉，他把达西先生也带来了
I'm sorry he came with Mr Darcy.

1267
01:43:31,748 --> 01:43:32,884
别那样说
Don't say that.

1268
01:43:34,218 --> 01:43:35,303
为什么？
Why ever not?

1269
01:43:38,139 --> 01:43:41,225
吉英
Jane.

1270
01:43:41,392 --> 01:43:46,272
- 我一直那么盲目  - 你说的是什么意思？
- I've been so blind.  - What do you mean?

1271
01:43:46,481 --> 01:43:49,233
看，是他。他回来了，他又来了
Look, it's him. He's back. He's come again.

1272
01:43:57,617 --> 01:43:59,577
我知道这一切都很唐突
I know this is all very untoward,

1273
01:43:59,786 --> 01:44:03,998
但我希望能有与班纳特小姐交谈的机会
but I would like to request the privilege of speaking to Miss Bennet.

1274
01:44:05,124 --> 01:44:07,335
单独交谈
Alone.

1275
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:12,173
所有人都立即去厨房
Everybody to the kitchen immediately.

1276
01:44:12,340 --> 01:44:16,385
当然除了你，吉英，我亲爱的
Except you, Jane, dear, of course.

1277
01:44:18,346 --> 01:44:23,392
噢，彬格莱先生，能这么快再见到你，真是太好了
Oh, Mr Bingley, it's so good to see you again so soon.

1278
01:44:43,454 --> 01:44:48,251
首先，我要告诉你，我是一个最愚昧无知的蠢货
First, I must tell you I've been the most unmitigated and comprehensive ass.

1279
01:45:06,769 --> 01:45:08,229
吉蒂, 安静点
Kitty, be quiet.

1280
01:45:20,616 --> 01:45:23,077
我答应你
Yes.

1281
01:45:23,244 --> 01:45:25,538
千千万万次答应你
A thousand times yes.

1282
01:45:30,876 --> 01:45:34,380
谢天谢地。我还以为这永远都不会发生
Thank the Lord for that. I thought it would never happen.

1283
01:46:20,718 --> 01:46:25,097
我相信他们在一起会幸福的
I am confident they will do well together.

1284
01:46:25,264 --> 01:46:29,268
他们的性格很相似
Their tempers are much alike.

1285
01:46:30,353 --> 01:46:34,273
他们那么好讲话，会被仆人们欺负的
They will be cheated assiduously by their servants.

1286
01:46:34,482 --> 01:46:40,654
他们都那么慷慨，到头来一定会入不敷出的
And be so generous with the rest, they will always exceed their income.

1287
01:46:40,863 --> 01:46:45,409
入不敷出？他一年有五千英镑收入
Exceed their income? He has 5,000 a year.

1288
01:46:49,372 --> 01:46:52,875
我一向认为她不会白白生得这么美丽
I knew she did not be so beautiful for nothing.

1289
01:47:01,258 --> 01:47:03,719
“...要远离所有的违心
"...must be free from all insincerity.

1290
01:47:03,886 --> 01:47:07,556
她只能是设身处地去理解他人
She only can address herself effectually to the feelings of others

1291
01:47:07,765 --> 01:47:11,018
那些人因为情感得到了温暖，思想更为活跃
whose mind glows with the warmth of sensibility

1292
01:47:11,227 --> 01:47:13,979
因为有了信念而善于辩驳
and whose arguments result from conviction.

1293
01:47:14,146 --> 01:47:17,650
她一定感受到激情和情感的影响
She must feel the influence of those passions and emotions

1294
01:47:17,858 --> 01:47:21,028
她希望能因此激发灵感...”
which she wishes to inspire..."

1295
01:47:41,799 --> 01:47:44,093
你会因为太幸福而死去吗？
Can you die of happiness?

1296
01:47:45,678 --> 01:47:48,681
他说春天时完全不知道我也在城里
He was ignorant of my being in town in the spring.

1297
01:47:48,848 --> 01:47:50,823
他有没有说明是什么缘故？
How did he account for it?

1298
01:47:50,824 --> 01:47:51,934
他以为我不爱他
He thought me indifferent.

1299
01:47:52,101 --> 01:47:55,855
- 深不可测啊  - 一定是他妹妹说我坏话的
- Unfathomable.  - No doubt poisoned by his sister.

1300
01:47:56,021 --> 01:48:01,610
精彩！我生平只听到你讲这一句气量小的话
Bravo. That's the most unforgiving speech you've ever made.

1301
01:48:01,777 --> 01:48:03,988
噢，伊丽莎白，但愿你也会同样的幸福
Oh, Lizzie, if I could but see you so happy.

1302
01:48:04,196 --> 01:48:06,490
但愿你也能找到这样一个人
If there was such a man for you.

1303
01:48:10,244 --> 01:48:13,497
说不定柯林斯还有个堂兄弟
Perhaps Mr Collins has a cousin.

1304
01:48:16,250 --> 01:48:18,127
- 那是什么声音？  - 什么？
- What is that?  - What?

1305
01:48:18,294 --> 01:48:21,380
也许他改变了主意
Maybe he's changed his mind.

1306
01:48:23,591 --> 01:48:25,718
来啦！
Coming!

1307
01:48:28,804 --> 01:48:30,222
哪位？
Yes?

1308
01:48:32,224 --> 01:48:34,268
凯瑟琳夫人
Lady Catherine.

1309
01:48:39,940 --> 01:48:42,860
我想这些就是你其余的孩子们了？
The rest of your offspring, I presume?

1310
01:48:43,027 --> 01:48:46,780
还有一个不在，最小的女儿最近出嫁了
All but one. The youngest has been lately married, your Ladyship.

1311
01:48:46,947 --> 01:48:49,908
大女儿下午刚刚订婚
My eldest was proposed to only this afternoon.

1312
01:48:51,785 --> 01:48:53,856
你们这儿还有个小花园呢
You have a very small garden.

1313
01:48:53,857 --> 01:48:55,789
要不要给你倒杯茶？
Could I offer you a cup of tea?

1314
01:48:55,956 --> 01:48:59,376
不必了。我要和伊丽莎白·班纳特单独交谈一会
Absolutely not. I need to speak to Miss Elizabeth Bennet alone.

1315
01:49:00,210 --> 01:49:02,421
有件要紧的事情
As a matter of urgency.

1316
01:49:06,383 --> 01:49:09,720
你一定不会不知道我为什么来吧
You can be at no loss to understand why I am here.

1317
01:49:09,887 --> 01:49:12,181
我完全不明白怎么会当得起你亲自上门这份荣耀
I cannot account for this honour at all.

1318
01:49:12,389 --> 01:49:16,602
我警告你，我是决不肯让人家来跟我开玩笑的
I warn you, I am not to be trifled with.

1319
01:49:16,769 --> 01:49:19,146
我听到一个极其惊人的消息
A most alarming report has reached me.

1320
01:49:19,313 --> 01:49:23,859
你试图攀上我的侄儿达西先生
That you intend to be united with my nephew, Mr Darcy.

1321
01:49:24,026 --> 01:49:25,341
虽然我明知这是无稽之谈
I know this to be a falsehood.

1322
01:49:25,342 --> 01:49:26,945
虽然我不会那样看不起他
Though not wishing to

1323
01:49:26,946 --> 01:49:28,605
以为他真会看上你
injure him by supposing it possible,

1324
01:49:28,606 --> 01:49:31,742
我还是立即过来这里，向你表明我的态度
I instantly set off to make my sentiments known.

1325
01:49:31,909 --> 01:49:34,995
你既然认为不可能，又何必大老远跑来
If you believed it impossible, I wonder that you came so far.

1326
01:49:35,204 --> 01:49:36,538
我是想亲耳听到这则消息是假的
To hear it contradicted.

1327
01:49:36,705 --> 01:49:37,971
如果外界真有这种流言
Your coming will be a confirmation

1328
01:49:37,972 --> 01:49:40,125
那么你的来访只会令流言弄假成真
if such a report exists.

1329
01:49:40,334 --> 01:49:43,587
如果？你假装对此事一无所知？
If? You pretend to be ignorant of it?

1330
01:49:43,754 --> 01:49:46,757
难道这不是你自己拼命传出去的吗？
Has it not been industriously circulated by yourself?

1331
01:49:46,924 --> 01:49:48,801
我从来没有听说过
I have never heard of it.

1332
01:49:49,009 --> 01:49:51,387
你能保证这次是空穴来风？
Can you declare there is no foundation for it?

1333
01:49:51,595 --> 01:49:55,099
我并不打算装得像你老人家一样坦白
I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your Ladyship.

1334
01:49:55,265 --> 01:49:56,333
你可以问
You may ask a question

1335
01:49:56,334 --> 01:49:58,352
但我有权利选择回答或者不回答
which I may choose not to answer.

1336
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:00,854
我的侄子究竟向你求过婚没有？
Has my nephew made you an offer of marriage?

1337
01:50:01,021 --> 01:50:04,108
你老人家自己刚刚还说过这绝不可能
Your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible.

1338
01:50:04,274 --> 01:50:06,067
达西先生早跟我的女儿订过婚了
Mr Darcy is engaged to my daughter.

1339
01:50:06,068 --> 01:50:07,861
好吧，你还有什么话要说？
Now what have you to say?

1340
01:50:08,028 --> 01:50:11,782
如果当真如此，那你就没有理由认为他会向我求婚
If that is the case, you cannot suppose he would make an offer to me.

1341
01:50:11,949 --> 01:50:17,079
你真是自私，这门婚事是从他们小时候就定下来的
You selfish girl. This union has been planned since their infancy.

1342
01:50:17,287 --> 01:50:20,624
你以为出身卑贱的你能够从中作梗？
Do you think it can be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth

1343
01:50:20,833 --> 01:50:22,267
何况你妹妹与人私奔
whose own sister's elopement

1344
01:50:22,268 --> 01:50:25,295
靠舅舅出钱资助
resulted in a scandalously patched-up marriage

1345
01:50:25,504 --> 01:50:28,757
才勉强结成了一门可耻不堪的婚事
only achieved at the expense of your uncle.

1346
01:50:28,924 --> 01:50:29,795
我的上帝啊！
Heaven and Earth!

1347
01:50:29,796 --> 01:50:32,845
难道彭伯里就要这样被你们这些人玷污么？
Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?

1348
01:50:33,011 --> 01:50:35,556
爽爽快快告诉我，你究竟跟他订婚了没有？
Tell me once and for all, are you engaged to him?

1349
01:50:39,017 --> 01:50:41,228
没有
I am not.

1350
01:50:42,104 --> 01:50:45,065
你愿意答应我，永远不跟他订婚吗？
Will you promise never to enter into such an engagement?

1351
01:50:45,232 --> 01:50:47,442
我不会答应你，我当然永远不答应
I will not and I certainly never shall.

1352
01:50:49,319 --> 01:50:51,613
你把我侮辱得够了
You have insulted me in every possible way

1353
01:50:51,822 --> 01:50:54,575
我不想再讲了
and can now have nothing further to say.

1354
01:50:55,868 --> 01:50:58,579
你现在马上给我离开
I must ask you to leave immediately.

1355
01:51:00,873 --> 01:51:02,207
晚安
Goodnight.

1356
01:51:04,209 --> 01:51:07,963
我一辈子都没有被这样对待过！
I have never been thus treated in my entire life!

1357
01:51:09,173 --> 01:51:12,676
- 发生什么事情了？  - 只是个小小的误会
- What is going on?  - Just a small misunderstanding.

1358
01:51:12,843 --> 01:51:16,096
求求你们，让我一个人静一下！
For once in your life, leave me alone!

1359
01:54:05,640 --> 01:54:08,476
- 我睡不着  - 我也是，我姑妈...
- I couldn't sleep.  - Nor I. My aunt...

1360
01:54:08,643 --> 01:54:11,813
是的，她昨晚来过
Yes, she was here.

1361
01:54:11,980 --> 01:54:15,150
我真希望我可以为昨晚的事情做出补偿？
How can I ever make amends for such behaviour?

1362
01:54:15,317 --> 01:54:17,694
经过丽迪雅的事情后
After what you've done for Lydia

1363
01:54:17,861 --> 01:54:21,198
还有吉英的事情，我想做补偿的人应该是我
and, I suspect, for Jane, it is I who should be making amends.

1364
01:54:22,449 --> 01:54:23,425
你得知道
You must know.

1365
01:54:23,426 --> 01:54:27,329
你一定得知道，我做这一切都是为了你
Surely you must know it was all for you.

1366
01:54:29,789 --> 01:54:32,959
你是个爽快的人，绝不会开我的玩笑
You are too generous to trifle with me.

1367
01:54:33,126 --> 01:54:36,546
昨做你与我姑妈的谈话，倒让我觉得事情有了希望
You spoke with my aunt last night and it has taught me to hope

1368
01:54:36,713 --> 01:54:39,424
以前我几乎不敢奢望
as I'd scarcely allowed myself before.

1369
01:54:40,884 --> 01:54:45,931
请你老实告诉我，你的心情是否还和四月里一样
If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.

1370
01:54:46,097 --> 01:54:49,100
我的心愿和情感依然如旧
My affections and wishes have not changed.

1371
01:54:49,309 --> 01:54:52,479
只要你说一句话，我便再也不提这桩事
But one word from you will silence me for ever.

1372
01:54:57,692 --> 01:55:01,988
如果，你的感觉有所改变的话...
If, however, your feelings have changed...

1373
01:55:04,783 --> 01:55:06,993
...我想告诉你
...I would have to tell you,

1374
01:55:07,202 --> 01:55:10,038
你把我的躯体和灵魂都占据了，我爱...
you have bewitched me, body and soul, and I love...

1375
01:55:10,205 --> 01:55:13,291
我爱...我爱你
I love... I love you.

1376
01:55:13,458 --> 01:55:16,419
从今天起我不想与你分开
I never wish to be parted from you from this day on.

1377
01:55:28,098 --> 01:55:29,808
唔
Well, then.

1378
01:55:34,729 --> 01:55:37,399
你的手好冷
Your hands are cold.

1379
01:56:21,734 --> 01:56:23,695
请关门
Shut the door, please.

1380
01:56:34,622 --> 01:56:40,128
你疯了吗？我以为你讨厌那个人
Lizzie, are you out of your senses? I thought you hated the man.

1381
01:56:40,295 --> 01:56:45,341
- 不，爸爸  - 他当然有的是钱，那是肯定的
- No, Papa.  - He is rich, to be sure.

1382
01:56:45,550 --> 01:56:49,387
可以使你的马车比吉英的更加豪华
And you will have more fine carriages than Jane.

1383
01:56:49,554 --> 01:56:52,015
难道这就会使你幸福吗？
But will that make you happy?

1384
01:56:52,223 --> 01:56:53,773
你认为我对他并没有感情
Have you no other objection

1385
01:56:53,774 --> 01:56:56,311
除此以外，你还有别的反对意见吗？
than your belief in my indifference?

1386
01:56:56,478 --> 01:56:58,688
一点没有
None at all.

1387
01:56:58,855 --> 01:57:03,735
我们都知道他是傲慢而不易亲近的人
We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of fellow.

1388
01:57:03,943 --> 01:57:06,321
不过，只要你真正喜欢他，这也无关紧要
But this would be nothing if you liked him.

1389
01:57:06,487 --> 01:57:08,198
我真的喜欢他
I do like him.

1390
01:57:10,617 --> 01:57:12,160
我爱他
I love him.

1391
01:57:15,288 --> 01:57:17,173
他不傲慢. 我是错的
He's not proud. I was wrong.

1392
01:57:17,174 --> 01:57:20,001
我以前对他的看法是完全错的
I was entirely wrong about him.

1393
01:57:23,379 --> 01:57:26,716
你不了解他，爸爸。如果我告诉你他真正的一面
You don't know him, Papa. If I told you what he was really like,

1394
01:57:26,925 --> 01:57:28,092
他做的事情...
what he's done...

1395
01:57:29,093 --> 01:57:31,137
他做了什么？
What has he done?

1396
01:57:39,229 --> 01:57:42,982
但她不喜欢他，我以为她不喜欢他
But she doesn't like him. I thought she didn't like him.

1397
01:57:43,191 --> 01:57:46,861
我也是这样想，我们以前都这样认为的
So did I. So did we all.

1398
01:57:47,028 --> 01:57:49,739
我们都错了
We must have been wrong.

1399
01:57:49,906 --> 01:57:52,392
这也不是第一次吧？
It won't be the first time, will it?

1400
01:57:52,393 --> 01:57:55,453
不，我敢说，也不会是最后一次
No, nor the last, I dare say.

1401
01:58:00,959 --> 01:58:02,752
我的天
Good Lord.

1402
01:58:05,380 --> 01:58:09,425
- 我必须要偿还他  - 不
- I must pay him back.  - No.

1403
01:58:09,592 --> 01:58:13,179
你不能告诉其他人  他不希望那样
You mustn't tell anyone. He wouldn't want it.

1404
01:58:13,388 --> 01:58:14,934
我们误解他了，爸爸
We misjudged him, Papa.

1405
01:58:14,935 --> 01:58:17,684
我对他的误解比你们都深，都深
Me more than anyone. In every way.

1406
01:58:17,892 --> 01:58:21,229
并不只是这件事
Not just in this matter.

1407
01:58:21,396 --> 01:58:24,065
我真是愚昧无知
I've been nonsensical.

1408
01:58:24,232 --> 01:58:27,356
但在吉英的事情上，他就像个蠢蛋一样
But he's been a fool about Jane,

1409
01:58:27,357 --> 01:58:29,195
对很多事都是这样
about so many other things.

1410
01:58:29,404 --> 01:58:32,824
但是，我也是一样
But then, so have I.

1411
01:58:35,743 --> 01:58:38,496
你知道的，他和我...
You see, he and I are...

1412
01:58:40,748 --> 01:58:43,918
他和我挺像的
He and I are so similar.

1413
01:58:44,127 --> 01:58:47,463
我们两个的性格都很固执
We're both so stubborn.

1414
01:58:49,132 --> 01:58:50,842
爸爸，我...
Papa, I...

1415
01:58:54,804 --> 01:58:57,181
你真的是很爱他，不是吗？
You really do love him, don't you?

1416
01:58:58,641 --> 01:59:00,935
非常爱
Very much.

1417
01:59:05,356 --> 01:59:11,112
我真不敢相信有人会配得上你
I cannot believe that anyone can deserve you.

1418
01:59:11,279 --> 01:59:15,491
现在看起来，是我看错了
But it seems I am overruled.

1419
01:59:15,658 --> 01:59:20,288
我衷心地祝福你们
So I heartily give my consent.

1420
01:59:28,671 --> 01:59:33,551
我是不想把你随便嫁给别人，我的伊丽莎白
I could not have parted with you, my Lizzie, to anyone less worthy.

1421
01:59:36,888 --> 01:59:37,889
谢谢你
Thank you.

1422
01:59:51,861 --> 01:59:54,374
如果有其他年轻的小伙子来找曼丽或者吉蒂
If any young men come for Mary or Kitty,

1423
01:59:54,375 --> 01:59:56,491
看在老天的份上，让他们进来吧
for heaven's sake, send them in.

1424
01:59:56,699 --> 01:59:59,243
我现在的生活可真是清闲
I'm quite at my leisure.

1425
01:59:59,577 --> 02:00:16,009
***谢谢收看***
下面的字幕感谢www.silu.info雪还是白的提供

1426
02:00:21,009 --> 02:00:22,708
你睡得好吗？亲爱的？
How are you this evening, my dear?

1427
02:00:23,109 --> 02:00:24,109
非常好
Very well.

1428
02:00:24,409 --> 02:00:26,309
- 希望你别再叫我“亲爱的”了  - 为什么？
-Only I wish you would not call me "my dear".  -Why?

1429
02:00:26,709 --> 02:00:30,109
因为每当我父亲生气时才会如此称呼我母亲
Because it's what my father always calls my mother when he's cross about something.

1430
02:00:30,209 --> 02:00:31,509
那我可以怎么称呼你呢？
What endearments am I allowed?

1431
02:00:31,709 --> 02:00:32,709
哦，让我想想看
Well let me think...

1432
02:00:33,309 --> 02:00:35,109
寻常日子叫我“丽兹”
"Lizzie" for everyday

1433
02:00:35,309 --> 02:00:37,709
星期天可以叫我“小傻瓜”
 "My Pearl" for Sundays

1434
02:00:37,809 --> 02:00:39,109
另外…
and...

1435
02:00:39,309 --> 02:00:43,409
在某些情况下，可以叫我“神气活现”
"Goddess Divine", but only on very special occasions.

1436
02:00:44,109 --> 02:00:47,409
那么，我生气时该怎么叫你呢？
And...what should I call you when I am cross?

1437
02:00:48,009 --> 02:00:49,509
达西夫人？
"Mrs. Darcy"?

1438
02:00:49,609 --> 02:00:52,409
不…不
No! No.

1439
02:00:52,709 --> 02:00:55,709
你只能在以下的情况下叫我“达西夫人”
You may only call me "Mrs. Darcy"...

1440
02:00:56,309 --> 02:01:01,409
即当你完完全全、千真万确、毫无疑问地觉得幸福时
when you are completely, and perfectly, and incandescently happy.

1441
02:01:04,809 --> 02:01:06,409
你今晚过得怎么样？
Then how are you this evening... Mrs. Darcy?

1442
02:01:07,809 --> 02:01:09,209
达西夫人？
Mrs. Darcy

1443
02:01:17,909 --> 02:01:19,309
达西夫人
Mrs. Darcy

1444
02:01:23,109 --> 02:01:24,209
达西夫人
Mrs. Darcy

1445
02:01:26,809 --> 02:01:28,009
达西夫人
Mrs. Darcy

1446
