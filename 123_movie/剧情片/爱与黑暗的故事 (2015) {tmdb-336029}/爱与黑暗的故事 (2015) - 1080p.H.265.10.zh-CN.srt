1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,790
Go to sleep.

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,750
I'm not tired.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,190
Ok.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,790
Let's make up a story together.

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,750
- You want me to start? - Yes.

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,760
Once there was this village, that all of it's inhabitants had left.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,230
Even the rats had left it.

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,670
Even the rats had left it.

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,670
And so stood this village, silent, abandoned for many years to come.

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,150
Rain beat on the streets,

11
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,390
washing away the traces of people.

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,070
When the rain stopped,

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,070
Birds flew over the village.

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,900
There were so many that it was difficult to see the sky.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,560
The whole day was night.

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,890
While in a small house ...

17
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,660
A little boy opened the door.

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,000
He was the only one left in the village.

19
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:20,030
"Story of love and darkness"

20
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,480
38 years old my mother was when she died.

21
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,600
In my present age, I could be her father.

22
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,270
Many things have happened in Jerusalem.

23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,270
The city was destroyed, rebuilt, destroyed and rebuilt.

24
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,790
The conquerors, one after another came to Jerusalem, ruled it for some time,

25
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,800
left behind several walls and towers, a few notches on the rock, a handful of shards -

26
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,740
and disappeared,

27
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,390
like the morning mist from the slopes of these mountains.

28
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:05,470
Jerusalem - an old nympho, shake off the lovers, after having squeezed them.

29
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,520
- We are late. - The child, Arie.

30
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,790
My mother grew up in the city of Rovno,

31
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,590
who was then in Poland, today in Ukraine.

32
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,390
Her childhood there consisted of words such as chandeliers,

33
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,630
servants, mystery,

34
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:45,630
romantic melancholy.

35
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,020
At a time when anti-Semitism had spread across Europe,

36
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,840
she dreamed about Israel,

37
00:02:54,990 --> 00:03:00,720
the land flowing with milk and honey, that pioneers turned the desert into a blooming garden.

38
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,320
She imagined a pioneering poet, worker, a revolutionary,

39
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,030
a man born to bear arms, to cultivate the land,

40
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,350
and, at the same time, to love the culture, possess a rich soul and developed intellect.

41
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,630
After mom and his family fled to Palestine,

42
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,230
Pines in the forest,

43
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,470
in the forest, where my mother and her sisters

44
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,590
He loved to pick mushrooms and berries,

45
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,600
spend the night in sleeping bags in the creek under a starry sky,

46
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,510
Germans, Lithuanians and Ukrainians murdered in

47
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,520
within two days more than 23 thousand Jews ...

48
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:58,960
Almost everyone who knew my mother.

49
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,800
A million little children ...

50
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,200
A million little children they killed! Children like you!

51
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,390
Slaughtered!

52
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,960
Jerusalem, 1945. The British Mandate.

53
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,790
Good afternoon, dear lady. I would like Tel Aviv 648.

54
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,510
Please wait, sir, a little while.

55
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,950
Right now Mr. Nashashibi is speaking.

56
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,870
I'm waiting my lady, of course, I'm waiting,

57
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,990
- But people are also waiting at the other end. - It's too early, Arie.

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,030
- But still we connect ... - But what will happen if we connect,

59
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,910
but they're still not there?

60
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,430
Hello? Zvi?

61
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,190
- It's me. - It Arie. From Jerusalem.

62
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,910
Yes, Arie, hello. It's me, Zvi. How are you?

63
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,910
We are fine. We call you

64
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,470
- From the pharmacy. - Ask my sister, how is.

65
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,790
What do you tell? What's in Tel Aviv?

66
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,630
Everything is fine. Nothing special. We live.

67
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,030
If not news - it's too bad. And we have no news.

68
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,670
We will write a letter and agree, when we will speak over the telephone the next time.

69
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,590
- Take care of yourselves. Good luck. - And you.

70
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,710
They were not sure at all that they would really talk another time.

71
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,200
A million little children ...

72
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:24,270
Suddenly there could be riots, pogroms, massacres, the British could turn against us ...

73
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:31,040
The curfew will be starting soon.

74
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,590
Hello everybody.

75
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,710
- Good evening. - Good evening.

76
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,720
Close the window! Close the door, please.

77
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:53,150
They went away. Everyone.

78
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,160
It's as if Rovno was only a dream.

79
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,720
It arrived.

80
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,030
New book directly from the printer.

81
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,300
"Novella in Hebrew Literature"

82
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,490
My first book.

83
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:55,590
"IA Klausner. Novella in Hebrew Literature"

84
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,680
This is almost like having another child.

85
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:10,640
I'll invite your parents.

86
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:16,640
My first teacher of literary history - my only brother David, who I lost in the darkness of exile. Where are you?

87
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,790
Who said that only your uncle would be the one with higher education in the family?

88
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,240
- It is - only my first publication. - Yes.

89
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,800
Not the last.

90
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,150
Borscht cute. Not bad.

91
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,430
Almost tasty.

92
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,310
But even peasant cooks in Jewish homes,

93
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,390
knew that the soup must be sour and only slightly sweet,

94
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,310
and in any case not the other way around - sweet and a little sour, as it is accepted by the Poles,

95
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,390
that pour sugar in everything in the world beyond measure.

96
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:28,400
Even they herring, they dip in jam.

97
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,470
Let's raise our glasses in honor of the book, which was published.

98
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:36,480
- Good luck! - Let's drink! - Good luck!

99
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,910
If forced to choose between lying and the ability to cause offense to a person,

100
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,920
Choose to be generous.

101
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,430
I'm allowed to lie?

102
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,630
Sometimes yes.

103
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,640
It is better if you're sensitive than direct.

104
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,550
Good. Come on.

105
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,000
Come, hold a peg.

106
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,630
We will create a small kibbutz.

107
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,640
- Own hands will get the bread out of the earth! - Kadima (forward).

108
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,600
You know, "Kadima" - means "to move" or "forward".

109
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,590
But...

110
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,790
the word, in fact, derives from "kedem" (Antiquity)

111
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,800
implying ancient times.

112
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,150
Therefore, speaking in Hebrew is, in essence, looking back in time.

113
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,230
- Interesting? - Yes.

114
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,070
- Good. - Are you okay?

115
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,630
Arie?

116
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,640
You recognize me even underneath all of this sweat? Pay attention to this.

117
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,290
- That's it. - That's it?

118
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,660
That's it.

119
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,590
My father told me once.

120
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,390
Amos, pay attention to the connection between the words:

121
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,270
"Adama" (earth, soil), "Adam" (man)

122
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,940
"Dam" (blood)

123
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,100
"Adom" (red)

124
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,540
"Dumiyah" (silence).

125
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,310
You sit for 6 months by yourself writing a new novel,

126
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,230
and immediately all the beautiful girls snatches them from the shelves,

127
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,470
and takes them straight to read in their beds.

128
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,630
At least, my books deliver a bit of fun.

129
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,790
If your goal is to get girls,

130
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,800
then maybe you should write romantic stories.

131
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,190
All I am saying is, don't hurry.

132
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,990
Ask your sisters, your life belongs only to you

133
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,790
for a very short period of time

134
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,110
after leaving the parental home before the first pregnancy.

135
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,630
And when your child is grown up, you will not become, as before, by yourself,

136
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,030
because you go from being a mom to being a grandma.

137
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,750
But everyone says that children is the best thing that can happen to you.

138
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,390
Who is everyone?

139
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,290
Remember what happened to the neighbor?

140
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,570
- Ira? - Yes.

141
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,110
Wife to Stilyetski.

142
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,830
- Yes Yes. - Yes, she had an alcoholic husband,

143
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,840
who ran our fathers mill.

144
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,790
He was betting her in a card game and lost her ...

145
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,270
everytime until one night.

146
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,910
Until at last she left him and fled with the son of the coachman.

147
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,270
Anton!

148
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,470
So, from his house,

149
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,480
she could see her children playing from a distance.

150
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:33,080
One day she decided to visit her daughter.

151
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,910
When she approached, her daughter called her a whore,

152
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,390
and did not want to talk to her.

153
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,160
That night, Ira gathered remnant forces,

154
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,200
entered into the small hut with kerosene ...

155
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,120
and lit a match.

156
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,070
Our children do not understand how much they can hurt us.

157
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,750
I just do not understand why ...

158
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,390
Why nobody warned you?

159
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,150
What do you want, a warning written in small letters,

160
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,390
that says, in the end, you are - just food?

161
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,270
That you are what the chick eats in order to grow and get stronger?

162
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,950
Polina, no one warns us,

163
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,310
because every mother thinks she is the only one who feels like this,

164
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,310
and every mother is crying alone in her pillow at night.

165
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,320
Exept for our mother who cursed us.

166
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:12,160
"Tarzan the invincible"

167
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
- Don't do any tricks. Be a good boy. Ok? - Ok.

168
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,880
My parents friends, Statzek and Mala Rudnitzki,

169
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,470
were childless,

170
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,720
so sometimes my parents left me with them.

171
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,270
Dad, as usual,

172
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,110
explained that the word "Chasuch" in the expression "Chasuche yeladim" (Childless)

173
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,350
Indeed, was connected to the word "Chashecha" (darkness),

174
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,280
and is similar in sound and spelling to the word "Schichecha" (oblivion). And perhaps, the ancient sense of the word -

175
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,600
lack of memory,

176
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,380
the absence of children,

177
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,840
absence of light.

178
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,590
My mother would sometimes leave by herself.

179
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,270
Where?

180
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,470
I could only imagine.

181
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,670
When we visit the Arab house,

182
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,950
it is important to remember courtesy.

183
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,030
No children or even young people, should not,

184
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,990
in any case, interfere with the adult conversation.

185
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,270
Only if we turn to you directly,

186
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,630
answer briefly, energetically, but politely.

187
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,750
If refreshments are served,

188
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,150
Do not dare to take something that will crumble or spill.

189
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,990
And if they still insist that you take something, then refuse,

190
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,750
but delicately, like a gentleman,

191
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,270
even if you can not resist the sight of sweets.

192
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,470
After all, we were invited only through Uncle Stashek,

193
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,230
who helped al-Hilwani's son get out of jail.

194
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,870
If we hold negative attitudes

195
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,550
we behave like animals,

196
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,070
and that is not only first-class insolence,

197
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:58,080
that can do terrible damage to the future of the two nations.

198
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,560
Coat? Coat?

199
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,550
My friend, you are welcome!

200
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,830
Pleased to meet you, madam. Pleased to...

201
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:57,590
I would like you to meet with my friend the great Mr. Sarf.

202
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,230
Mr. Sarphil helped to clear my son, Edward from that unfortunate incident

203
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,230
at the beginning of summer. Thank you for coming.

204
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,630
Please come. Maybe the young sir

205
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,640
Maybe the young sir would like to go play in the garden?

206
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:19,680
Please, please, madam.

207
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:40,110
Come on, dear, let's go home.

208
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,550
Good morning, my lady.

209
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:01,560
My name is Amos. And you?

210
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,270
My name is Aisha.

211
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,110
This - my brother, Awad.

212
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:13,630
Your father, your dear father,

213
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,750
He invited me to go out to play with you.

214
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,470
He is not my father. He is the uncle of my mother.

215
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,150
I do not live here, I live in Talbieh.

216
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,620
How do you know Hebrew?

217
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,310
I have been learning to play the piano in Rehavia (In Jerusalem) for 3 years now.

218
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,270
Hebrew is a beautiful language, and the Rehavia quarter is also very beautiful.

219
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,270
Clean and quiet.

220
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:39,280
The Talbieh quarter is also clean and quiet.

221
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,470
Is it possible to talk a little bit?

222
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,480
Aren't we already talking?

223
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,390
The land of Israel has enough space for two people.

224
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,400
You just need to learn to live together in peace and respect.

225
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,460
I have another older brother in London. He is studying to become a lawyer.

226
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,510
What do you want to study, when you grow up?

227
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,550
What do you want to be?

228
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,550
You will eventually lawyer. Judging by your talk.

229
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,270
Why do you think so?

230
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,350
I'm going to write a book.

231
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,190
Indeed? Which kind of book?

232
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,830
Poems.

233
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,910
- Poems? - Yes, in French and in English.

234
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,920
I also write in Arabic, but do not show it to anyone.

235
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,430
- Are there beautiful poems in Hebrew? - Of course.

236
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,440
Levin Kipnis, Rachel, Zeev Jabotinsky, Tchernichovsky ...

237
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,990
"A generation of the land,

238
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,310
full of life,

239
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,320
withdraws from the chains of slavery."

240
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,390
You know how to climb trees?

241
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,350
I do not have any minute.

242
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:22,190
Give me a minute.

243
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,670
I do not have any minute.

244
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,310
Give me a minute.

245
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,790
I do not have any minute.

246
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,160
I do not have any minute.

247
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,110
Give me a minute ...

248
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,720
This is the father of Amos.

249
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,110
May I please speak with Mr. al-Hilwani?

250
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:17,310
Well, could you please tell him how very truly sorry we are about what happened?

251
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,990
We are anxious for the health of the dear child.

252
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
We will pay any of the childs medical expenses of course in full.

253
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,630
We sincerely wish to set a meeting at an early date to clarify

254
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,640
we tried to right a wrong ...

255
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:52,790
Once upon a time there were two monks who had taken upon themselves all sorts of strict vows.

256
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:57,800
In particular, they vowed to walk on foot through all of India

257
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,840
from end to end.

258
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,670
And they also vowed complete silence

259
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:14,680
not utter a single word, even in a dream, during all the years of travel.

260
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,490
But one day, when they went to the river bank,

261
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:25,560
they both heard a cry for help. A screaming woman drowning in the turbulent flow.

262
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:39,270
Without words and conversations the youngest of them jumped into the water,

263
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,280
and on his back brought the drowning woman to shore, silently laid it on the sand,

264
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,990
and both the monks continued on in silence.

265
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,710
And now, after six months or even a year,

266
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,940
suddenly the young monk asked his companion:

267
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,590
"Tell me,

268
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:10,030
do you think I have sinned, carrying the woman on my back?"

269
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,430
But comrade replied with a question:

270
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:17,440
"What, you still continue to carry her on your back?"

271
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,870
You know, Amos,

272
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,350
when I was a student,

273
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:37,470
I loved to sit here among the flowers, and read.

274
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,670
And one day, after school, she met your future father.

275
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,750
Do you remember? I told you about the word "Perach" (Flower).

276
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,910
The word "Perach" (Flower) is composed of "Par" and "Reach" (Fragrance).

277
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,550
"Par" is the root of "Pirion" (Fertility)

278
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:54,110
and "Reach" is the fragrance that tempts the insect to fertilize the plants.

279
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,830
He exploits your mothers weakness for words.

280
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,270
Well, what could I do?

281
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,830
All the students courted her. I had to stand out.

282
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,230
Exactly.

283
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,270
Remembering -

284
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,110
it's like trying to build an ancient building

285
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:10,710
of the stones of its ruins.

286
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,940
And the stones remember.

287
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,510
Could I please get some A.P.C?

288
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,510
Yes, immediately.

289
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,270
I have a headache that does not leave me.

290
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,550
I do not believe them. No, I do not believe.

291
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:34,560
- It's a huge affair. - You think so?

292
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,670
What are you saying that all this - only intrigue?

293
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,830
All of this - a huge affair, as in the theater.

294
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,510
After all, Ben-Gurion had already quietly agreed to sell all of Jerusalem to King Abdullah.

295
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,510
And for that the British and the Arabs leave the kibbutzim alone.

296
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,990
And what will happen to us -

297
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
- to slaughter us, or burn us? It makes no difference to them. - What is with you? What are you saying?

298
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,660
A million little children ...

299
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,590
If there is a war, when there will be a war, we will win it.

300
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,950
Our state is literally standing at the gate.

301
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,950
- A million little children. - It is not standing. There is no gate.

302
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,210
There is an abyss. - Not in front of the boy.

303
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,410
Ugh.

304
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:26,080
- Nothing has grown. - Come here.

305
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,630
You know, if you open a human skull and take out the brain,

306
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,310
You will see that our brain is merely a cauliflower?

307
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,950
Merely a cauliflower like this.

308
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,390
But what a miracle:

309
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,030
Such a small cauliflower

310
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,390
holds the heavens and the earth,

311
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,750
and the sun and all the stars,

312
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,350
and Plato's ideas

313
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,550
and the music of Beethoven,

314
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,260
and Chekhov's play's ...

315
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:11,180
And maybe all of the dinosaurs and whales ...

316
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,810
And the hope of humanity, and passion, and lust, and errors, and fantasy ...

317
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,710
And that's it.

318
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:30,160
You do not know how to throw.

319
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,030
Amos!

320
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,230
Come play with us.

321
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,240
I can not. Grandma comes today.

322
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,520
Children! What are you doing there?

323
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
You abandoned me. I have no life here.

324
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
You spat in my face, in the face of your mother,

325
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
the only person who ever cared about you!

326
00:29:06,724 --> 00:29:09,624
Look at yourself.

327
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,548
How do you stand it?

328
00:29:15,872 --> 00:29:17,872
This place is disgusting.

329
00:29:20,996 --> 00:29:23,596
Oh, I'm not good enough to recieve an answer from you?

330
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,020
I should have left you in Rovno!

331
00:29:28,044 --> 00:29:31,044
It would have been better for me!

332
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:58,410
Fanichka!

333
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,850
Fania.

334
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:09,280
Amos, where is your mother?

335
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,250
Fania.

336
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,470
You will not believe.

337
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,230
My books are sold, all five!

338
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,750
He said he will order more. And he have already ordered five more by phone.

339
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,760
He said that this is only the beginning.

340
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,120
Let's go to the movies and see "Edison", the new film.

341
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,780
You will go to Zarkhi at this time, okay?

342
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,950
For us.

343
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,870
Both hell and paradise

344
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,270
can be found in every room.

345
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,230
A little bit of wickedness -

346
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,070
and a person is in hell.

347
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,950
A little compassion, a little generosity -

348
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,910
and a person is in paradise ...

349
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,110
Hello, congratulations.

350
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,550
I still do not believe it.

351
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,670
Regards from Garbo.

352
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:35,680
Amos, behave yourself.

353
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:09,120
Book?

354
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,600
Tchernichovsky.

355
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,950
I think your patience helped our plants.

356
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,960
Why do not you go and take a look for yourself?

357
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,430
When my family moved to the house on Dubinskaya street,

358
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:47,310
They continued to live tenants there "inherited" from the previous owners.

359
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:51,710
In the anterior room lived a Polish officer with the name of Jan.

360
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,230
Every Friday, my mother sent one of us

361
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:59,310
with a tray of poppy biscuits, fragrant, fresh from the oven,

362
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,150
I wish him "Shabbat shalom" on behalf of the entire family.

363
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,110
Shabbat shalom.

364
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,310
Cutie.

365
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,470
And he stroked the girl's head,

366
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,220
He called her "gypsy"

367
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,670
and he promised her that he was waiting only for her,

368
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:21,090
and he promised to marry her as soon as she gets older.

369
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,470
But one day,

370
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,670
Sunday, before dawn,

371
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:40,190
even before the first glimmer of light,

372
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:45,030
The officer decided to check how his gun.

373
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,040
First, he released two bullets to the closed window facing the garden.

374
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,830
By chance he hit a dove.

375
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:57,310
The next day, this pigeon was found in the courtyard, wounded, but alive.

376
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,990
Then officer drove one bullet

377
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,750
in a wine bottle standing on the table,

378
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,990
He shot twice at the chandelier in the ceiling ...

379
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,310
and ...

380
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:30,160
Once I found a note in the closet hidden in a slot,

381
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,150
written by a female hand.

382
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,830
"My little Zevon, know that you are very dear to me!

383
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:42,230
Throughout my life I have never met a man better and nobler than you.

384
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:46,070
I am not worthy to kiss the soles of your shoes. "

385
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:50,910
In the word "sole" I found two grammatical errors.

386
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,390
The note was signed with the letter G.

387
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,400
and in the end it was painted with puffy lips, the substitute for a kiss.

388
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,630
No one knows anything about the other.

389
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,640
Even about your husband or wife. And no one knows anything about himself.

390
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,710
We know nothing.

391
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:24,970
And if at times it seems for a moment that we know, then it's even worse,

392
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,710
because it is better not to know anything,

393
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:32,710
than to live deceived.

394
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,560
November 29, 1947

395
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,870
Tonight, in Lake Success, near New York,

396
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,790
The United Nations General Assembly

397
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,030
will meet to vote for that?

398
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,590
For the adoption of UNSCOP Committee recommendations.

399
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,070
And what is the recommendation?

400
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,710
Create the territory of the British Mandate of two independent states:

401
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,510
One Jewish and one Arab.

402
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,310
Who objects?

403
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:03,310
Islamic countries, along with the UK Government.

404
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,470
And why?

405
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,150
Their goal is the transformation of the whole of the land of Israel into an Arab state under British protectorate,

406
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,870
like Egypt, Transjordan and Iraq.

407
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,830
Well done.

408
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,550
You know, Lake Success, means in English the "Lake of Success".

409
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,990
That is the exact opposite of "Sea of ​​Tears"

410
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,110
The term Bialik used to symbolize the fate of our people.

411
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:27,950
- It's interesting. - Wow, that's interesting.

412
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,750
Mali: yes.

413
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,070
Pakistan: no.

414
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,110
Panama: yes.

415
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,580
Paraguay ...

416
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,340
Yes.

417
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,770
- Peru ... - Excuse me, can you help me? - Yes.

418
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:47,190
Take him to his mother.

419
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,190
- Netherlands: yes. - Yes!

420
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,350
- Saudi Arabia: no. - Come, my dear.

421
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:00,630
Siam: no.

422
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,790
Sweden: yes.

423
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,390
Syria: no.

424
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,270
Turkey: no.

425
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,670
Ukraine: yes.

426
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,430
Union of South Africa: yes.

427
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,910
- Yes ... - The Soviet Union: Yes.

428
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,990
United Kingdom: abstained.

429
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,430
USA: Yes.

430
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,750
- Uruguay: yes. - It was a "yes"!

431
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,350
Venezuela: yes.

432
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,470
Yemen: no.

433
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,480
Yugoslavia: abstained.

434
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,350
The resolution of the special commission on the question of Palestine

435
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:54,080
was adopted by the Organization of the United Nations.

436
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,760
The people of Israel are alive! The people of Israel are alive!

437
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:11,230
The people of Israel, the people of Israel, the nation of Israel lives!

438
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,890
Everything changes, everything must change.

439
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:42,480
I told you so.

440
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,400
"We brought peace to you ...

441
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,840
We brought peace to you ... "

442
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:27,280
Finally.

443
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,030
You can not imagine at all how the boys mocked me

444
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:52,040
In the Polish school in Vilnius.

445
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,630
And when the next day, my father, your grandfather,

446
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,910
came to the school, demanding justice, and hooligans attacked him.

447
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,830
Knocking him to the ground ...

448
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:07,590
and pulled off his pants in the middle of the courtyard.

449
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,390
All the kids were laughing,

450
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,400
and teachers watched in silence.

451
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,760
Some of them, also, laughed.

452
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,800
Of course, one day bullies will annoy you, on the street or at school.

453
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,670
Perhaps they will do it just because you're a little bit like me.

454
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,750
But now, from the moment that we have a state,

455
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,760
bullies will never bother you, because you are Jewish. Never.

456
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,550
After about three hours,

457
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,630
seven in the morning, while we were sleeping,

458
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,950
Jerusalem Arabs began armed attacks on Jewish vehicles

459
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,960
which spread throughout the country.

460
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:33,310
My nickname is Garibaldi.

461
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,430
I will instruct you,

462
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,150
how to help our patriots.

463
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,350
You will help ...

464
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,350
You will search through all the yards, all the sheds and warehouses,

465
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,790
will collect and empty bags to fill them with sand,

466
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,150
and empty bottles. Some will be able to fill them with a cocktail,

467
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,230
very tasty for the enemy.

468
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:57,670
On vacant lots and abandoned backyards you will collect "Chubeza" (a wild plant)

469
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,990
to somehow counter the threat of famine in Jerusalem.

470
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,070
We also set the duty observers

471
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:09,080
to prevent any movement of the British. Go.

472
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,710
How nice. Wash, and I'll make some right now.

473
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:42,570
Of course, you are hungry after your search.

474
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:48,230
Fill this with water.

475
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,030
Fanichka.

476
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:01,040
I mobilized in self-defense units, Fanichka.

477
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,830
You have nothing to say to this?

478
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,350
What do you want me to say?

479
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:13,360
Well done, you are very brave.

480
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,430
The war invaded our house.

481
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:28,230
Life turned into rations, sandbags, work.

482
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,070
In the life of individuals,

483
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,110
as well as in the lives of the people as a whole,

484
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:04,230
the most terrible conflicts erupt between two sides that are persecuted.

485
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,590
Only in fantasy, do both sides that are persecuted united in solidarity

486
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:17,600
to fight with the cruel oppressor together.

487
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,870
But in fact,

488
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,470
two sons of the same father,

489
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:27,480
do not necessarily become allies.

490
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,670
It often happens that they don't see a brother as a fellow,

491
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:35,680
but as a reflection of the face of their common oppressor.

492
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,270
Europe, mocked the Arabs,

493
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,550
humiliated and robbed them by colonialism,

494
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:48,560
and it was the same Europe, that persecuted and destroyed the Jews.

495
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:55,430
But the Arabs, looking at us, they see in front of them not a nervous handful of refugees,

496
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,470
but an extension of the arrogant European colonizers.

497
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:03,190
And we, on our part, look at the Arabs

498
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,550
and we see before us not victims, like us, but bloodthirsty anti-Semites,

499
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,430
Nazis in disguises.

500
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,590
At midnight on May 15, 1948

501
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:18,600
The 30-year-old power of the British Mandate ended ...

502
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:23,590
... Proclaimed by Ben Gurion in Tel Aviv

503
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,710
a few hours before midnight.

504
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:29,250
For many weeks our basement apartment served as a kind of refuge

505
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:34,050
for the residents of the upper floors.

506
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,670
I have a connection ...

507
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,020
- You're pulling, it hurts. - Sorry, sorry.

508
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,270
100 Jews were burned alive yesterday, not far from the quarter Sheikh Jerash.

509
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,230
They were in a convoy that was on it's way to the Hadassah hospital and to the university.

510
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,110
100 people.

511
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,950
Doctors and nurses, workers and students.

512
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,190
Why did they stop?

513
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,510
The British gave no exit.

514
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,470
How can you enjoy the taste of a quarter of this chicken,

515
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,790
when there is such misery going on right before your eyes?

516
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,800
The children have not gotten any meat for months...

517
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:34,880
Please, madam.

518
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,280
- I do not know why we stayed here. - Who is next?

519
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:00,120
When they killed her friend,

520
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,990
when a tragedy occurs outside pages of my mother's novels,

521
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,000
suffering did not seem romantic to her at all.

522
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,550
We reached an armistice agreement with Egypt.

523
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:47,100
After Egypt there will be an agreement with Transjordan,

524
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,190
and then in the end there will be an agreement with Syria and Lebanon.

525
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,030
Thank God!

526
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,750
When the British left,

527
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:07,760
the green line was established around Israel.

528
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:13,470
The neighbors returned to their homes enthusiastic and optimistic,

529
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:18,430
and left us alone.

530
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:22,510
With the founding of an independent Jewish state,

531
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,190
It disappeared as if it was not,

532
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,350
thousands of years of longing of the Jewish people

533
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,070
for their homeland.

534
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:35,070
Maybe my mother felt the loss of desire, dreams,

535
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:40,080
because suddenly she ceased to tell their stories.

536
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:17,790
"And there, what do my eyes see?

537
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:21,430
A boy of about three years stands in the middle of the street,

538
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,470
in constrast to a flying war machine.

539
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,350
I braced myself and I shouted:

540
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:31,590
"Boy, boy!"

541
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,590
- "And as I shouted, I rushed up to him ..." - What's he saying?

542
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,310
and he quickly moved aside.

543
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,270
Who knows? Maybe his mom left him?

544
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:43,430
Maybe his family is very poor, and was not able to feed him,

545
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,430
and could not see the child hungry?

546
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,230
And perhaps the boy is an orphan without parents?

547
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:53,230
Yes, there are such in our world. "

548
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,830
- I told you, wait for me! - Who do you think is the best football player?

549
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,230
- It seems to me like Dado is. - I think I am.

550
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:10,550
- No, I think I'm a little better. - I am. - No, I am.

551
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:14,830
- David, Moshe, you and me. - What if? Look at it this way:

552
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:18,710
Me, and then David, then Moses, and then you.

553
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:23,710
You are very funny, you know.

554
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,750
Give me your sandwich.

555
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,760
Give me your sandwich.

556
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,790
I'll be back in fifteen minutes.

557
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,830
Can I go with you?

558
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,830
I need to spend some time alone.

559
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,890
Stay here.

560
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:56,340
I'll be back soon.

561
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,070
Maybe, you can tell me, finally,

562
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:49,910
what it is about you, that I love so much?

563
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,390
More than anything..

564
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,710
More than anything I love your naiveté.

565
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:58,870
Never in all my life I have never met such naiveté.

566
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,550
Even after you will lived a long life,

567
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,990
and have had many experiences,

568
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,000
This naivete will not leave you. Never.

569
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:15,270
I think that when you grow up, you will be that kind of man that is ...

570
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,670
open and enthusiastic like your father.

571
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:22,550
But at the same time you will be quiet and closed man,

572
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:27,560
deep and full, like a well in a village abandoned by its inhabitants ...

573
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:33,200
It's possible to be simultaneously thus and thus.

574
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:45,780
I was suddenly filled with horror.

575
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:48,170
It seemed, from a distance, on the horizon,

576
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:53,230
coming and gradually becoming ever more clearly, some unknown disaster.

577
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,510
My mother started having headaches.

578
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,500
Together with migraine

579
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:04,520
came insomnia.

580
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:24,190
The doctor prescribed all sorts of sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medications,

581
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:30,400
but it did not help.

582
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:44,350
Please do not be mad at me, Amos.

583
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,670
It's a little rough for me right now,

584
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:51,680
but you can see that I am trying to make everything ok.

585
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:59,710
Thank you, Amos.

586
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:04,720
I know I can count on you completely.

587
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:09,960
- Good night. - Good night.

588
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:24,280
- Dad? - Sleep, sleep.

589
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:33,280
I'm a lucky girl, I'm a lucky girl.

590
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:17,610
Thank you.

591
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,130
Your Mom punishes herself,

592
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:23,340
just to punish me.

593
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:27,880
Go.

594
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:33,800
Go, play a little bit on the street.

595
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:40,350
Just be very careful. Women are different.

596
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:45,360
They're not all as good and honest as you.

597
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:57,000
Come back when you want.

598
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,790
You need something?

599
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:11,800
Amos is here.

600
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,870
Dad and I had to tell the neighbors,

601
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:31,510
that she had the flu or a special sensitivity to daylight,

602
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,630
or that she was very tired.

603
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:38,350
We did not tell anyone what was only known to both of us.

604
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:40,960
The only one who knew was her closest friend.

605
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,630
Amos, you are a ray of light, you know that?

606
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:49,640
Your mom says you're her sunshine.

607
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,070
You are such a intelligent and sensitive boy.

608
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:07,510
You know, I have a feeling,

609
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:11,750
that when you grow up, you'll be a writer.

610
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,790
I will not be a writer. Feelings disgust me.

611
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:20,800
I will be a farmer, or one of those who poison dogs with a syringe.

612
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:27,520
- Have a good day. - And you.

613
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:45,670
You know what happened when Tarzan met the cowboys and the Indians?

614
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,870
What happened?

615
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,230
Tarzan watched from the tree,

616
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:52,790
while the cowboys and Indians fought under him.

617
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:57,310
One cowboy grabbed the throat of the snake that was crawling under his feet,

618
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:00,710
and forced it's poison into the mouth of the Indian.

619
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:06,220
Then Indian grabbed a prickly cactus and stabbed ...

620
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:09,510
the cowboy between his blue eyes.

621
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,990
Tarzan watched them from above

622
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:17,000
while thinking what to do.

623
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,870
And then what?

624
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:25,880
I'll tell you tomorrow.

625
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:31,710
Wow, that was a great story. Where did you hear it?

626
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:34,670
Tell me isn't that your dad?

627
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:39,680
Where?

628
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,390
Amos, you're a very good boy.

629
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,150
Your mother is suffering from a terrible headache.

630
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,350
Just talk quietly

631
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:58,150
without running or going on a rampage, ok?

632
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:03,160
Open, quickly.

633
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:15,910
- Do you need anything? - No thanks.

634
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,950
So why don't you lie down?

635
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:21,150
I'm good like this. Thank you.

636
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:23,590
- Did you see a doctor? - I don't need a doctor.

637
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,790
Mom, leave her alone.

638
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,430
Don't interfere, Arie.

639
01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:28,950
Comedian ... as if coming to the moon.

640
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:32,230
Well what, the melancholic mood?

641
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:34,470
This is a sign that the heart is still young.

642
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:36,630
You may think that it has only been hard for her here,

643
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:41,640
that apart from her, we're all munching on honey here.

644
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:50,890
Did you finish your homework?

645
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:52,760
Fania?

646
01:10:55,010 --> 01:10:56,870
How did you sleep?

647
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:00,270
Good. Finally I slept well.

648
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:03,390
Well, the new pills are really working.

649
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:07,630
So many dreams I dreamt yesterday.

650
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:11,630
A dream of a man that I have not thought of for a long time.

651
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:14,350
In Rovno there was a wealthy trader in furs,

652
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,430
he even recieved couriers from Paris sent,

653
01:11:16,430 --> 01:11:21,430
since he had a rare sort of fur, which was called the "silver fox":

654
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:26,870
it shone and sparkled like frost on a moonlit winter night.

655
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:31,590
And then one day the merchant became a staunch vegetarian.

656
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,830
He left his house, built himself a small hut in the forest,

657
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:37,790
because he could not forgive himself for the thousands of foxes,

658
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:42,110
that hunters had killed for him.

659
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:46,470
And so, this man disappeared completely.

660
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:49,830
When me and my sisters wanted to scare each other,

661
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:54,110
The three of us would lay on the carpet in the dark,

662
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:57,110
and each described in turn,

663
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:01,590
how the man who once was a wealthy fur merchant,

664
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,460
Now was wandering naked through the woods.

665
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,480
Perhaps he is mad now

666
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,910
and howling in the thicket like a fox. And maybe this howling has made his hair stand on end.

667
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:14,550
And surel, everyone who has a chance encounter in the woods with the fox-man at night

668
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:15,950
the horror

669
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:20,270
- All the hair on your head become white. - I'm sorry, it's supposed to mean?

670
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:25,850
Allegory? Superstition?

671
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:27,800
Sorry.

672
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:32,880
Don't be late to school and work, guys.

673
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:39,510
What happened to you? What's that supposed to mean?

674
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:44,520
I'm sorry. This is all because of me.

675
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:26,070
Today, I decided to invite the two men in my life

676
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:29,630
for lunch at my expense at a restaurant.

677
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:32,310
- Dad knows? - We'll surprise him.

678
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:33,990
Let's go to his work,

679
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,750
and pull him out, like you pull out book moths from books.

680
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,980
Let's go.

681
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:44,970
Today you will be my cavalier.

682
01:13:45,070 --> 01:13:47,910
- What is a "cavalier"? - A cavalier is a knight.

683
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:52,920
"Sheval" - is horse in French. A "chevalier" - a horseman, a knight.

684
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:10,880
- You are welcome. - Thank you.

685
01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:16,830
Arie.

686
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:29,030
Excuse me.

687
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:33,110
What happened? Are my parents all right? And yours? Everything is fine?

688
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:36,590
Yes, everything is all right. We wanted to surprise you.

689
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:41,600
We're taking you to eat lunch.

690
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:46,190
Well, why not, in fact?

691
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:48,750
Today, I'm the hostess, and I'll be glad if you order

692
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:53,760
the most expensive dishes from the menu.

693
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,590
You are ready?

694
01:15:00,690 --> 01:15:02,180
Yes.

695
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:05,710
Vegetable soup and chicken cutlet with mashed potatoes, please.

696
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:10,280
I'm the same, please.

697
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:12,180
Fania?

698
01:15:12,910 --> 01:15:14,950
Fania?

699
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:21,010
Only white rice, please

700
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,500
and black coffee.

701
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,130
Thank you.

702
01:15:52,790 --> 01:15:56,350
Fania? Fania?

703
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:02,520
Fanitshka.

704
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:11,920
Mom, are you okay?

705
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:27,990
She needs absolute rest.

706
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,990
I will take care of it.

707
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Thank you Doctor.

708
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:53,720
These are new tablets.

709
01:16:56,910 --> 01:16:59,340
They will help you sleep.

710
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:06,680
Drink some more water.

711
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:36,350
I do not know how to help you.

712
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,590
You're not responsible for me.

713
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:43,600
Fan, I do not know how to help you.

714
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:46,350
Maybe I'll take you a while to Tel Aviv?

715
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:51,260
To be with your sisters, ventilate.

716
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:55,460
Yes, a little bit of air.

717
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:05,310
We can not allow to leave the killers

718
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:07,310
the property that they stole from us.

719
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:11,150
And we need the money in order to take in those who survived the massacre.

720
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:12,870
What are you talking about?

721
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:17,880
We do not sell the forgiveness in exchange for money stained with blood.

722
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:25,510
A few days in Tel Aviv, and you will be as good as new.

723
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:28,790
Not surprising, that you're unhappy, while living in Jerusalem.

724
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,710
We will pamper you.

725
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:35,310
You do not have to do anything except how to relax.

726
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:38,630
Fania, maybe eat a slice of cake?

727
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,550
I'm not hungry.

728
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,390
Do you eat at all?

729
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:47,400
You sound like mother.

730
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:14,190
Good, if that's what will be good for her ... She is a Jerusalemite.

731
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:16,950
Yes, it has no sea, she does not know what it is.

732
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:19,790
Just don't come to us in the summer.

733
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:22,210
Does not matter.

734
01:19:26,850 --> 01:19:28,220
That winter

735
01:19:28,270 --> 01:19:30,910
Ayalon river, also called "Wadi musrara"

736
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:35,920
overflowed and flooded the neighborhoods of Tel Aviv.

737
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:18,120
My mother grew up in a kind of vague fascination - in the world of spirituality and beauty.

738
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:21,190
When the wings of this fascination, in the end, hit

739
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:24,350
the Jerusalem stone floor - naked,

740
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:29,360
hot and dusty.

741
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:43,830
20 years later, after graduating from high school in Rovno,

742
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:46,740
when this romantic schoolgirl

743
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:49,790
suddenly appeared on the bumpy road of everyday life -

744
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:54,270
among heat waves, poverty, violence,

745
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:59,510
diapers, migraines, queues, family life disappointments -

746
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:05,150
her childhood promises have been violated, trampled,

747
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:10,600
and even turned into a mockery of life itself.

748
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:39,280
Maybe when life is not filled with any of the promises of her youth,

749
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:43,310
Mom painted death to herself

750
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:45,630
in the image of an exciting lover

751
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:50,640
and at the same time ready to hide under the shadow of its peacefulness.

752
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:56,140
If I was writing the story,

753
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:58,810
it would have another ending.

754
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:29,600
But so it's decided.

755
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:38,910
Dad is at home?

756
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:43,920
There was a telephone call from Tel Aviv, please, this is urgent.

757
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:38,350
Two years after my mother's death,

758
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:40,310
I left the house,

759
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:43,790
left Jerusalem,

760
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:45,910
Changed my name

761
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:50,920
and went to Kibbutz Hulda.

762
01:24:57,460 --> 01:24:59,690
Mom Dreams:

763
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:02,150
milk and honey,

764
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:05,180
to make the desert bloom,

765
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:06,820
to be a pioneer.

766
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:11,840
- Hi. - Amos?

767
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:17,630
Hi.

768
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:22,640
You're taller than me.

769
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:41,550
Can I get the suitcase please?

770
01:25:41,650 --> 01:25:43,360
Thank you.

771
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:07,150
No matter how much I learned to drive a tractor,

772
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:09,550
move irrigation lines on the fields,

773
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:12,470
shoot with an old Czech rifle,

774
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:17,470
I could not escape out of my own skin.

775
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:29,680
No matter how much I sunbathed, I couldn't fool anyone.

776
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:35,230
Everyone, and I myself, too, knew very well,

777
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:38,620
that even though my skinned had been tanned, inside I stayed pale,

778
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:44,320
I stayed inside the pale.

779
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,870
This is my school now.

780
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:50,350
The only way to keep the dream alive,

781
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:52,870
full of hope and not disappointing

782
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:55,950
is to never try to implement it.

783
01:26:55,960 --> 01:27:00,960
A dream brought to life, is disappointing.

784
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:03,830
This disappointment -

785
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:08,840
is the nature of dreams.

786
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:33,250
"Мom"
