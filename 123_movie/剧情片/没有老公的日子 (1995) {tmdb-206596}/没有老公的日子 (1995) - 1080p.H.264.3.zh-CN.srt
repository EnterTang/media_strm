AL DI Là DELLE NUVOLE (1995)

3
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:25,588
Excuse me.

4
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:29,190
Can you suggest a hotel?

5
00:06:29,294 --> 00:06:31,592
A good one
or a simple one?

6
00:06:32,497 --> 00:06:35,660
You choose.
I'll trust you.

7
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:39,227
There's onejust back there.

8
00:06:41,106 --> 00:06:42,300
Thanks.

9
00:07:47,772 --> 00:07:49,831
I need a room, please.

10
00:07:49,975 --> 00:07:51,875
A single?

11
00:07:55,513 --> 00:07:58,073
Room 4. Any luggage?

12
00:07:59,784 --> 00:08:01,718
I'll be right back.

13
00:09:03,248 --> 00:09:07,947
We met earlier,
but you didn't even look at me.

14
00:09:09,754 --> 00:09:13,656
The beautiful thing is
that I came here by chance.

15
00:09:16,294 --> 00:09:18,524
Why beautiful?

16
00:09:21,032 --> 00:09:23,899
I was supposed to go
somewhere else.

17
00:09:24,969 --> 00:09:28,405
At one point
I let the car drive me.

18
00:09:29,474 --> 00:09:32,534
Me, I'm stuck here
in the fog.

19
00:09:33,411 --> 00:09:38,576
I'm a teacher. I can't escape
except when school is out.

20
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:41,745
Where do you go?

21
00:09:42,487 --> 00:09:44,614
The city.

22
00:09:46,758 --> 00:09:49,283
I just escaped from there.

23
00:10:17,188 --> 00:10:20,749
Have you noticed
nobody watches sunsets anymore?

24
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,590
Maybe it happens in towns too...

25
00:10:26,097 --> 00:10:29,294
but when myjob brings me
out to the country...

26
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,267
I'm always enchanted
by the sunsets.

27
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,872
I'm a drainage pump technician.

28
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,380
There are lots around here.

29
00:10:44,482 --> 00:10:46,712
My name is Carmen.

30
00:10:47,552 --> 00:10:49,417
I'm Silvano.

31
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:11,572
Voices never become part ofyou
like other sounds.

32
00:11:12,477 --> 00:11:16,277
The sea, for instance.
You end up not hearing it.

33
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:21,210
But a voice
you can't help listening to.

34
00:11:24,122 --> 00:11:25,749
It's strange.

35
00:11:26,524 --> 00:11:30,153
We always want to live
in someone's imagination.

36
00:11:33,298 --> 00:11:36,699
Maybe that's the secret
of being in love.

37
00:11:39,737 --> 00:11:42,501
I like your eyes.

38
00:11:43,641 --> 00:11:46,542
They're so empty
ofeverything...

39
00:11:47,212 --> 00:11:49,806
except sweetness.

40
00:12:13,671 --> 00:12:16,105
Which is your room?

41
00:12:16,207 --> 00:12:18,107
The one on the right.

42
00:12:58,383 --> 00:13:00,044
Good night.

43
00:13:18,303 --> 00:13:20,066
Night.

44
00:18:20,271 --> 00:18:23,297
Has the girl in Room 8
already left?

45
00:18:23,407 --> 00:18:24,396
Ofcourse.

46
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:27,607
She's always up early
for work.

47
00:18:27,712 --> 00:18:30,112
Where can I buy flowers here?

48
00:18:30,214 --> 00:18:32,910
Flowers don't grow
in the lagoon.

49
00:18:33,918 --> 00:18:36,386
Can you send those
to her room?

50
00:18:36,587 --> 00:18:39,078
I'll get some fresh ones.

51
00:19:27,538 --> 00:19:29,733
Did you like it?

52
00:20:29,266 --> 00:20:31,791
It's a miracle
meeting you again!

53
00:20:32,603 --> 00:20:34,696
Nothing happens by chance.

54
00:20:35,206 --> 00:20:37,504
- This is Sara.
- Pleased to meet you.

55
00:20:38,976 --> 00:20:42,412
- I have to go. I'm running late.
- Did I scare you off?

56
00:20:42,513 --> 00:20:46,279
No, I must get to the shops
before they close.

57
00:20:46,383 --> 00:20:48,749
Bye, Carmen.
See you tomorrow.

58
00:20:48,853 --> 00:20:50,377
Bye.

59
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:05,865
I've wondered for two years
why you left that morning...

60
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,200
without even saying good-bye.

61
00:21:08,305 --> 00:21:11,331
I waited all night foryou.

62
00:21:14,512 --> 00:21:16,537
I've been wondering lately...

63
00:21:16,647 --> 00:21:20,310
why I have such a need
to hear words.

64
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:23,710
Nobody talks anymore.

65
00:21:25,956 --> 00:21:28,015
Eyes are in fashion.

66
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:32,860
True words are shut up inside.

67
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:36,266
Bring some out.

68
00:21:37,868 --> 00:21:39,699
All right.

69
00:21:40,805 --> 00:21:44,036
There's a kind ofenslavement
that we can desire...

70
00:21:45,209 --> 00:21:48,178
when we're under a spell.

71
00:21:49,513 --> 00:21:51,572
For example, now...

72
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,981
I'm enslaved by your silence.

73
00:22:27,484 --> 00:22:29,213
Do you live here?

74
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,550
Yes, this is my home.

75
00:22:32,056 --> 00:22:34,524
You must be very rich!

76
00:22:37,461 --> 00:22:39,395
It's beautiful.

77
00:22:39,496 --> 00:22:41,487
Another world.

78
00:22:44,068 --> 00:22:46,195
Who else lives here?

79
00:22:47,037 --> 00:22:50,131
A family from Naples
lives upstairs.

80
00:23:23,274 --> 00:23:25,208
Are you with somebody?

81
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:28,103
Not at the moment.

82
00:23:35,085 --> 00:23:37,679
There's always something
left behind.

83
00:23:38,389 --> 00:23:41,017
Like dregs in a coffee cup.

84
00:23:48,699 --> 00:23:51,497
My grandma used to read
coffee cups.

85
00:23:52,803 --> 00:23:56,569
She knew all about everyone
who drank coffee with her.

86
00:24:10,688 --> 00:24:13,282
I lived with a man
for a year.

87
00:24:14,024 --> 00:24:16,891
Ten days ago,
he wrote me a letter.

88
00:24:17,928 --> 00:24:20,260
I know it by heart.

89
00:24:21,332 --> 00:24:23,323
It's about scents.

90
00:24:23,701 --> 00:24:27,068
Some scents cling
to your skin forever.

91
00:24:29,807 --> 00:24:33,334
"l can still smell the scent
ofyour skin and your words.

92
00:24:34,445 --> 00:24:37,437
A few nights ago,
I went back to the river...

93
00:24:37,548 --> 00:24:40,312
where we stopped last time.

94
00:24:41,285 --> 00:24:43,378
I stayed there...

95
00:24:44,421 --> 00:24:47,185
feeling you close to me."

96
00:24:58,035 --> 00:25:01,368
Words do us good,
even in writing.

97
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:04,571
A woman expects them.

98
00:25:05,342 --> 00:25:07,367
She always does.

99
00:40:06,509 --> 00:40:08,136
Can I help you?

100
00:52:59,048 --> 00:53:01,312
Excuse me.

101
00:53:01,417 --> 00:53:03,715
Sorry to botheryou.

102
00:53:04,019 --> 00:53:05,919
May l?

103
00:53:09,024 --> 00:53:10,821
Thankyou.

104
00:53:14,563 --> 00:53:17,464
I read a strange thing
in my magazine.

105
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:20,427
I want to talk to someone
about it.

106
00:53:23,639 --> 00:53:25,971
And you picked me?

107
00:53:27,009 --> 00:53:28,840
You're not French,
are you?

108
00:53:28,944 --> 00:53:32,573
No, I'm from New York,
but I live here.

109
00:53:32,681 --> 00:53:34,080
Where are you from?

110
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:36,640
Italy.

111
00:53:37,953 --> 00:53:42,583
- So may l?
- Go ahead. I'm "all ears."

112
00:53:42,691 --> 00:53:44,522
Isn't that what they say?

113
00:53:44,626 --> 00:53:46,253
I hope so.

114
00:53:51,734 --> 00:53:53,702
In Mexico...

115
00:53:53,802 --> 00:53:57,260
some scientists hired porters
to take them...

116
00:53:57,372 --> 00:54:00,034
to an lncan city
in the mountains.

117
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:05,539
At one point,
the porters stopped.

118
00:54:05,647 --> 00:54:07,615
They refused to go on.

119
00:54:08,484 --> 00:54:13,251
The scientists got angry
and tried to get them moving.

120
00:54:14,823 --> 00:54:18,122
They couldn't understand
the long delay.

121
00:54:20,829 --> 00:54:22,888
After several hours...

122
00:54:23,332 --> 00:54:26,130
the porters set off again.

123
00:54:26,635 --> 00:54:29,661
Finally, their leader decided
to explain.

124
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:36,569
What had happened?

125
00:54:37,379 --> 00:54:39,540
I see you're interested.

126
00:54:40,349 --> 00:54:42,078
Now, very.

127
00:54:46,889 --> 00:54:48,652
He said...

128
00:54:49,591 --> 00:54:52,253
they'd been walking too fast.

129
00:54:52,361 --> 00:54:54,829
They'd left their souls behind.

130
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:58,699
Their souls?

131
00:55:00,035 --> 00:55:01,935
It's wonderful! It's like us.

132
00:55:02,037 --> 00:55:04,699
We go rushing around...

133
00:55:04,807 --> 00:55:07,071
and lose our souls.

134
00:55:07,876 --> 00:55:09,776
We should wait for them.

135
00:55:11,914 --> 00:55:13,973
To do what?

136
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:24,288
Everything that seems
pointless.

137
00:56:13,242 --> 00:56:15,403
You're still up?

138
00:56:18,413 --> 00:56:21,405
I asked you
a friendly question.

139
00:56:24,486 --> 00:56:26,454
Were you with her?

140
00:56:27,356 --> 00:56:29,722
We met briefly.

141
00:56:31,493 --> 00:56:34,394
Since that story
about souls in the cafe...

142
00:56:34,897 --> 00:56:36,888
it's been three years.

143
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:46,700
Some things can't be
called off overnight.

144
00:57:00,088 --> 00:57:02,079
For the last time...

145
00:57:02,691 --> 00:57:04,955
it's her or me.

146
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:36,890
You're late.

147
00:57:38,393 --> 00:57:41,556
Sorry.
The traffiic was bad.

148
00:57:41,663 --> 00:57:43,722
Everything's against us.

149
00:57:56,511 --> 00:57:59,309
Look, we've got to talk.

150
00:58:04,853 --> 00:58:06,844
Go ahead...

151
00:58:09,758 --> 00:58:12,454
but caress me
at the same time.

152
00:58:13,962 --> 00:58:15,862
Gently.

153
00:58:22,237 --> 00:58:24,762
I've forgotten it all.

154
00:58:33,482 --> 00:58:35,416
Patricia.

155
00:59:25,834 --> 00:59:27,699
Oh, shit.

156
00:59:45,987 --> 00:59:47,921
What's up?

157
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:56,993
What are you up to?

158
01:00:01,636 --> 01:00:04,127
I've been calling you
for two days.

159
01:00:06,341 --> 01:00:08,605
That's a vase to me.

160
01:00:09,211 --> 01:00:12,374
What's a vase to you?

161
01:00:14,249 --> 01:00:16,342
Vase offlowers.

162
01:00:16,451 --> 01:00:19,784
Flowers... colors.

163
01:00:19,888 --> 01:00:22,049
Colors... beauty.

164
01:00:22,157 --> 01:00:24,489
Beauty... Iove.

165
01:00:33,802 --> 01:00:36,828
Everything seems ridiculous.

166
01:00:37,572 --> 01:00:39,403
Love is ridiculous.

167
01:00:39,508 --> 01:00:41,635
It has to be said.

168
01:00:43,278 --> 01:00:46,645
It's an illusion. A trap.

169
01:00:46,748 --> 01:00:50,707
But the trap is mysterious,
so we all fall into it.

170
01:00:50,819 --> 01:00:53,049
Like stewed prunes!

171
01:01:19,514 --> 01:01:22,108
You bring me your calm...

172
01:01:22,217 --> 01:01:24,708
after sleeping with her?

173
01:01:30,692 --> 01:01:32,853
I slept alone.

174
01:01:32,961 --> 01:01:34,724
I felt bad.

175
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:38,290
I was away on a trip.

176
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,300
You know that.

177
01:01:44,105 --> 01:01:46,471
Didn't you take her?

178
01:01:47,008 --> 01:01:49,738
I didn't take anybody.

179
01:01:53,648 --> 01:01:56,412
I loved making love to you.

180
01:01:57,986 --> 01:02:00,648
Go fuckyourself.

181
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:11,394
You've got a new vocabulary.

182
01:02:14,202 --> 01:02:17,968
Because you're talking gibberish.

183
01:02:26,214 --> 01:02:29,411
Say what you like,
but last night...

184
01:02:32,287 --> 01:02:37,020
I realized how much I miss
making love to you.

185
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:50,961
I'll come back
ifyou leave her.

186
01:02:51,306 --> 01:02:53,570
I will. I swear.

187
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:58,877
- When?
- Today.

188
01:02:59,547 --> 01:03:01,777
This morning.

189
01:03:01,983 --> 01:03:04,213
Now.

190
01:03:05,253 --> 01:03:07,244
Right now.

191
01:03:19,367 --> 01:03:22,996
Don't leave me.
Don't leave me.

192
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,449
Tell me.

193
01:04:16,858 --> 01:04:19,088
Do you still make love
behind my back?

194
01:04:20,729 --> 01:04:23,254
I've been saying no to her
for three years.

195
01:04:24,899 --> 01:04:27,094
Would she want to?

196
01:04:27,202 --> 01:04:29,033
Probably, yes.

197
01:04:32,607 --> 01:04:35,269
And you've always refused.

198
01:04:35,377 --> 01:04:37,402
Well, yes.

199
01:04:41,483 --> 01:04:43,280
And today?

200
01:04:44,619 --> 01:04:46,985
Did you say yes or no?

201
01:04:53,194 --> 01:04:55,094
I pitied her.

202
01:05:06,274 --> 01:05:08,242
Don't you pity me?

203
01:05:08,343 --> 01:05:10,675
For three years you've been
bringing her smell here!

204
01:05:14,649 --> 01:05:18,244
The smell on your clothes.
The stale smell ofa cheated woman!

205
01:07:37,959 --> 01:07:39,654
Thanks.

206
01:08:00,415 --> 01:08:01,780
Bye.

207
01:09:44,352 --> 01:09:45,683
You'ne back?

208
01:09:45,787 --> 01:09:47,914
- Where are you?
- Somewhene.

209
01:09:49,290 --> 01:09:51,121
What's gotten into you?

210
01:09:53,461 --> 01:09:56,225
- Emptying the house.
- It's my funnitune.

211
01:09:57,065 --> 01:10:01,695
- You could leave a note.
- You nevendid.

212
01:10:01,803 --> 01:10:05,330
- Because of myjob!
- Leaving mestuckat home!

213
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,840
- Where are you?
- Don't tryto findme.

214
01:12:06,527 --> 01:12:08,154
Is the lady here?

215
01:12:08,262 --> 01:12:10,730
No, she went out.

216
01:12:10,832 --> 01:12:13,960
I spoke to her
about renting the place.

217
01:12:14,068 --> 01:12:15,626
What place?

218
01:12:17,271 --> 01:12:18,932
This one, I think.

219
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,975
I brought the newspaper ad.

220
01:12:22,076 --> 01:12:24,476
It's entirely my wife's idea.

221
01:12:24,579 --> 01:12:26,843
I'm not even sure I agree.

222
01:13:04,418 --> 01:13:07,080
Don't say that
or I'll go crazy.

223
01:13:08,556 --> 01:13:11,081
May I explain my situation?

224
01:13:11,959 --> 01:13:14,154
I prefer short stories.

225
01:13:14,262 --> 01:13:16,822
I'll put it in a nutshell.

226
01:13:17,531 --> 01:13:19,863
My husband has been having
an affair for three years.

227
01:13:19,967 --> 01:13:21,935
I was patient.

228
01:13:22,036 --> 01:13:25,062
He always said it would pass.

229
01:13:26,207 --> 01:13:28,004
But in fact--

230
01:13:30,845 --> 01:13:33,609
- The doorbell rang.
- I didn't hear it.

231
01:13:33,714 --> 01:13:35,614
I'm expecting the furniture.

232
01:13:35,716 --> 01:13:37,707
What furniture? Mine?

233
01:13:38,619 --> 01:13:40,484
My husband's.

234
01:13:41,155 --> 01:13:44,022
So you emptied an apartment too.

235
01:14:19,493 --> 01:14:21,518
What are you going to do?

236
01:14:21,629 --> 01:14:23,290
I don't know.

237
01:14:23,731 --> 01:14:26,359
I guess I'll have
to go away again.

238
01:14:26,467 --> 01:14:27,729
Where to?

239
01:14:28,602 --> 01:14:31,696
I have commitments
outside Paris.

240
01:14:32,773 --> 01:14:35,003
So you'll cope somehow.

241
01:14:35,109 --> 01:14:36,667
Yes.

242
01:14:37,078 --> 01:14:40,241
But this time I was planning
to stay put.

243
01:14:40,348 --> 01:14:42,475
I told her so.

244
01:14:43,517 --> 01:14:47,283
Maybe that's why she went
to live with him.

245
01:14:47,388 --> 01:14:49,413
With whom?

246
01:14:50,358 --> 01:14:52,223
The lover.

247
01:14:56,998 --> 01:15:00,161
So you're in a precarious
position too.

248
01:15:02,536 --> 01:15:04,094
Right.

249
01:15:04,205 --> 01:15:06,173
It seems to be the thing.

250
01:15:31,065 --> 01:15:32,794
This is her.

251
01:15:38,939 --> 01:15:40,804
She's beautiful.

252
01:15:41,876 --> 01:15:43,434
My wife.

253
01:16:10,171 --> 01:16:12,230
Don't try to fii nd me.

254
01:16:28,889 --> 01:16:31,483
There's a cure for everything.

255
01:16:34,328 --> 01:16:36,888
That's what disturbs me.

256
01:18:08,055 --> 01:18:09,784
May l?

257
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:29,036
I told you.
Don't phone me again.

258
01:19:24,965 --> 01:19:29,402
I wonder why our society needs
all these copies ofthings.

259
01:19:30,638 --> 01:19:33,664
Notjust paintings.
Copies ofeverything.

260
01:19:34,375 --> 01:19:39,039
Even things like clothes,
suitcases, bags, watches.

261
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:42,808
Originals are very costly.

262
01:19:42,916 --> 01:19:44,281
True.

263
01:19:44,618 --> 01:19:47,587
But in your case,
a reproduction of Cezanne...

264
01:19:48,856 --> 01:19:51,120
or a photo
ofthe landscape would do.

265
01:19:51,925 --> 01:19:56,794
I believe that anyone
who copies a masterwork...

266
01:19:56,897 --> 01:19:59,923
has a chance of repeating
the artist's action...

267
01:20:00,534 --> 01:20:03,662
and possibly recapturing,
ifonly by chance...

268
01:20:03,771 --> 01:20:05,966
the exact gesture.

269
01:20:06,073 --> 01:20:07,597
A copy ofthe gesture.

270
01:20:08,375 --> 01:20:10,138
Why not?

271
01:20:12,012 --> 01:20:14,572
Recapturing a genius's nature...

272
01:20:17,117 --> 01:20:19,779
will satisfy me more...

273
01:20:20,054 --> 01:20:23,251
than any brushstroke of my own.

274
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:42,274
I can see why you laugh.

275
01:20:42,376 --> 01:20:44,810
I won't sell it to you anyhow.

276
01:20:44,912 --> 01:20:46,743
Don't worry.

277
01:20:47,181 --> 01:20:49,308
- Please.
- I'm sorry.

278
01:20:49,416 --> 01:20:50,974
Thankyou.

279
01:22:15,702 --> 01:22:18,500
I'm looking
for the architect's offiice.

280
01:22:18,605 --> 01:22:20,573
It's across the street.

281
01:23:18,499 --> 01:23:20,194
Excuse me.

282
01:23:32,112 --> 01:23:33,704
May I come with you?

283
01:23:33,814 --> 01:23:35,679
I'm going to church.

284
01:23:37,417 --> 01:23:40,682
Are you a Catholic?
Do you believe in God?

285
01:23:40,787 --> 01:23:42,550
What is this, a test?

286
01:23:42,656 --> 01:23:46,023
If I say yes, I can escort you,
and if not, I can't?

287
01:23:46,126 --> 01:23:47,923
Is that the idea?

288
01:23:48,629 --> 01:23:50,426
Sorry.

289
01:23:52,165 --> 01:23:54,656
No, I'm not sorry.

290
01:23:57,604 --> 01:24:00,129
Are you always so quiet?

291
01:24:00,541 --> 01:24:02,270
Why?

292
01:24:03,477 --> 01:24:05,240
I have nothing to say.

293
01:24:05,345 --> 01:24:08,405
With so many things
going on around you?

294
01:24:10,884 --> 01:24:12,476
Maybe I should go alone.

295
01:24:14,555 --> 01:24:17,115
No, I should escort you.

296
01:24:18,258 --> 01:24:21,284
Don't worry.
Nothing can happen to me.

297
01:24:23,230 --> 01:24:25,596
You must read a lot.

298
01:24:26,033 --> 01:24:27,967
Not even the papers?

299
01:24:28,502 --> 01:24:31,665
I used to browse through them.
Not anymore.

300
01:24:31,905 --> 01:24:34,373
Once I read this in a paper:

301
01:24:34,474 --> 01:24:37,910
"lfonly a cherry tree
could eat its own cherries!"

302
01:24:38,879 --> 01:24:41,507
You're the tree
that eats its own fruit.

303
01:24:42,382 --> 01:24:46,318
I think that to be happy
we should eliminate our thoughts.

304
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:49,514
That's a thought in itself.

305
01:24:49,623 --> 01:24:51,181
That's true.

306
01:24:51,959 --> 01:24:54,519
That's why I prefer
to keep quiet.

307
01:24:54,628 --> 01:24:56,653
That only makes it worse!

308
01:24:57,064 --> 01:24:59,828
Silence fii lls our heads
with thoughts.

309
01:25:01,501 --> 01:25:03,901
I mean pointless thoughts.

310
01:25:05,038 --> 01:25:07,199
How do we get rid ofthose?

311
01:25:10,510 --> 01:25:12,478
If I could...

312
01:25:13,547 --> 01:25:14,912
I'd escape.

313
01:25:15,015 --> 01:25:16,676
Where to?

314
01:25:18,185 --> 01:25:19,914
Away from my body.

315
01:25:21,221 --> 01:25:23,018
Why?

316
01:25:24,458 --> 01:25:26,926
One ofthe body's shortcomings...

317
01:25:27,027 --> 01:25:28,858
is that it needs so much.

318
01:25:29,529 --> 01:25:31,360
It's never satisfiied.

319
01:25:31,832 --> 01:25:36,030
Don't run down all its needs.
Some can be fun to satisfy.

320
01:25:38,005 --> 01:25:42,567
Try giving up your little fun.
You'll see the peace it brings.

321
01:25:42,676 --> 01:25:45,702
We already have
so many unfulfii lled dreams...

322
01:25:45,812 --> 01:25:47,473
at the end ofeach day!

323
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:22,539
I think I've got it.

324
01:26:23,283 --> 01:26:25,274
You're in love.

325
01:26:25,385 --> 01:26:28,081
You show all the signs
ofa girl in love.

326
01:26:29,523 --> 01:26:31,753
- It's true.
- I knew it!

327
01:26:32,159 --> 01:26:34,992
You're detached,
like all satisfiied women.

328
01:26:35,862 --> 01:26:39,093
Yes, I am satisfiied.

329
01:26:43,036 --> 01:26:45,129
So peaceful!

330
01:26:47,307 --> 01:26:51,641
Right now I have
life's rarest treasure: serenity.

331
01:26:51,945 --> 01:26:54,812
It comes from being
with a satisfiied woman.

332
01:26:54,915 --> 01:26:57,543
Satisfiied people are rare.

333
01:26:58,618 --> 01:27:00,677
Excuse me.
Are you satisfiied?

334
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:04,254
Don't be ridiculous.

335
01:27:07,394 --> 01:27:09,862
- See? It's rare.
- What time is it?

336
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:12,625
A quarter to 5:00.

337
01:27:20,273 --> 01:27:22,002
Can we hurry?

338
01:27:22,109 --> 01:27:24,043
Where are we going?

339
01:27:26,313 --> 01:27:28,440
St.John of Malta's.

340
01:27:28,815 --> 01:27:30,942
- Are you from here?
- No.

341
01:27:32,452 --> 01:27:34,545
Will you tell me
where you're from?

342
01:27:35,856 --> 01:27:38,484
I'd really rather not.

343
01:33:01,881 --> 01:33:04,008
Like flowers.

344
01:33:04,117 --> 01:33:05,744
That's true.

345
01:33:06,286 --> 01:33:07,776
It's pretty.

346
01:33:10,457 --> 01:33:12,948
This sounds like sacrilege...

347
01:33:13,726 --> 01:33:15,694
but I don't like flowers.

348
01:33:16,830 --> 01:33:19,321
I do, but they make me sad.

349
01:33:19,432 --> 01:33:23,027
They're beautiful--
gorgeous for two days.

350
01:33:23,136 --> 01:33:26,230
Then they wilt
and get thrown away.

351
01:33:28,441 --> 01:33:31,740
TheJapanese don't grow flowers
so as not to see them die.

352
01:33:32,378 --> 01:33:34,243
Why are you smiling?

353
01:33:36,382 --> 01:33:39,044
You're scared ofdeath,
aren't you?

354
01:33:42,388 --> 01:33:44,219
Scared is not the word.

355
01:33:46,559 --> 01:33:48,720
I'm scared of life.

356
01:33:49,596 --> 01:33:52,531
A girl your age,
scared of life? Absurd!

357
01:33:56,536 --> 01:33:58,834
The life people lead.

358
01:33:58,938 --> 01:34:02,635
You undervalue it.
What do you want from life?

359
01:34:04,010 --> 01:34:06,171
Nothing.

360
01:34:06,279 --> 01:34:08,406
What? Nothing?

361
01:34:08,515 --> 01:34:11,712
Life is all we have.
It's all there is.

362
01:34:11,818 --> 01:34:14,582
It's the only thing
we know exists.

363
01:34:15,488 --> 01:34:17,217
Look.

364
01:34:21,728 --> 01:34:24,891
Here we're alive.
There we're dead.

365
01:34:26,099 --> 01:34:28,260
Here we can laugh.

366
01:34:28,368 --> 01:34:30,427
There we can laugh all we like--
no one will see.

367
01:34:31,538 --> 01:34:33,472
We're in the beyond.

368
01:34:36,943 --> 01:34:39,741
Your opinion is
beside the point.

369
01:35:00,733 --> 01:35:03,258
Please don't treat me
like this.

370
01:35:03,503 --> 01:35:07,803
Your courtesy reminds me too much
that I'm a woman.

371
01:35:08,007 --> 01:35:09,838
You don't like it?

372
01:35:12,278 --> 01:35:14,109
I wish I were a man.

373
01:35:14,914 --> 01:35:16,438
A strong man.

374
01:35:20,954 --> 01:35:22,979
Almost all women say that...

375
01:35:24,691 --> 01:35:27,785
but usually
for practical reasons.

376
01:35:28,328 --> 01:35:30,319
Never for poetic ones.

377
01:35:30,430 --> 01:35:33,831
I mean I'd like to be
as strong as a man.

378
01:35:35,034 --> 01:35:37,901
An enigma--
that's what you are.

379
01:35:38,004 --> 01:35:40,768
And, like all enigmas,
disconcerting.

380
01:35:41,507 --> 01:35:44,203
I want to know you better.
Discoveryou.

381
01:35:46,312 --> 01:35:49,645
I'd like us to be friends.

382
01:35:49,749 --> 01:35:52,650
It's hard to relate to someone
who's in love...

383
01:35:52,752 --> 01:35:54,583
but I'd like to try.

384
01:35:55,288 --> 01:35:57,483
I'm not saying this
to please you.

385
01:35:57,991 --> 01:36:00,687
You're not the type
to like compliments.

386
01:36:06,032 --> 01:36:08,296
Not that kind ofcompliment.

387
01:36:10,203 --> 01:36:13,070
I'd rather be told
that I pray well.

388
01:36:13,973 --> 01:36:17,170
Can you be good or bad
at praying?

389
01:36:17,277 --> 01:36:19,040
Oh, yes!

390
01:36:19,412 --> 01:36:23,781
The way you looked in church,
you must be brilliant!

391
01:36:25,852 --> 01:36:28,252
It was like you were dead.

392
01:36:29,122 --> 01:36:30,953
I was dead.

393
01:36:31,924 --> 01:36:34,017
A little.

394
01:36:41,801 --> 01:36:43,200
Look!

395
01:36:43,303 --> 01:36:46,864
Lone men at night
look like criminals.

396
01:36:50,710 --> 01:36:52,473
Typical!

397
01:36:52,578 --> 01:36:56,309
A criminal who lets you by
and then starts singing.

398
01:36:56,416 --> 01:36:59,408
I haven't seen a man sing
in the street foryears.

399
01:37:22,809 --> 01:37:24,674
Are you hurt?

400
01:37:39,125 --> 01:37:41,650
- Sure you're okay?
- I'm fii ne.

401
01:37:44,230 --> 01:37:46,289
You got your coat dirty.

402
01:37:52,872 --> 01:37:55,102
What if I fell in love
with you?

403
01:37:56,976 --> 01:38:00,070
You'd be lighting a candle
in a room full of light.

404
01:40:13,079 --> 01:40:15,309
Can I see you tomorrow?

405
01:40:31,063 --> 01:40:33,497
Tomorrow I enter a convent.

406
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,087
