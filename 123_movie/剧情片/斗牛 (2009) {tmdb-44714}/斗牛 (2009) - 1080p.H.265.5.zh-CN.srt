1
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,879
Chief!

2
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,756
Where is everyone?

3
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,397
Jiu

4
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,397
Anybody alive here?

5
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,548
I am Niu Er!

6
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,549
Everybody...

7
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,679
Everybody...

8
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,949
It can't be...

9
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,989
All dead...

10
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,515
"Judging from this cow's size, the bulls must be really big!"

11
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,788
Shame on you!

12
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,117
Let me see!

13
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,629
What some grass?

14
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,749
What grass?

15
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,992
Foreign cattle eat grain.

16
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,389
Chief

17
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,629
"Uncle,"

18
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,758
the 8th Route Army offers him the first taste.

19
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,439
Already two buckets...

20
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,674
The milk flows like a river.

21
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,749
Chief!

22
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,278
Do cows have parents?

23
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,797
Idiot!

24
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,039
It's the law of nature!

25
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,711
Think you were born out of a stone?

26
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,956
Lmpossible!

27
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,715
Animals make milk only if they can reproduce.

28
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,952
"Niu Er, why are you here?"

29
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,794
Aren't you embarrassed? Look!

30
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,755
"See how big the foreign cow is? Next to it,"

31
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,995
yours is nothing.

32
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,589
Go to hell!

33
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,030
My cow is good!

34
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,316
That thing... It's a monster.

35
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,393
She's still going! What a cow!

36
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,153
So much milk.

37
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,028
This cow is worth more than us!

38
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,636
Absolutely.

39
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,590
It only gives milk for a few months each year.

40
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,750
We milk it with restraint.

41
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,639
"Comrade, could I have some milk?"

42
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,988
My baby is hungry.

43
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,113
Sure! Children shouldn't go hungry.

44
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,113
What are you doing?

45
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,675
Hard work never did anyone any harm

46
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,748
People from other villages

47
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,279
are overrunning us!

48
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,993
"As a newcomer, you don't understand!"

49
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,673
Milk is needed for the wounded of the 8th Army.

50
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,870
So newcomers should starve

51
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,197
It hasn't been easy for m to marry into your village.

52
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,512
Widows should keep quiet!

53
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,833
"Chief, I wantjustice!"

54
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,998
Must newcomers starve in your village?

55
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,193
The old saying goes...

56
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,758
"Women who bring bad luck to their husbands"

57
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,069
Severe punishment

58
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,350
Nonsense!

59
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,032
Your wife

60
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,275
is not from this village!

61
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,159
Let her bring you bad luck!

62
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,953
He wants me to die!

63
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,110
"See, Niu..."

64
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,516
That girl Jiu needs discipline.

65
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,112
Then she'll be as tame as a cow.

66
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,515
Have you ever touched udders?

67
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,318
Not such big ones.

68
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,028
Big talker! Not even small ones.

69
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:58,076
"If you dare touch those udders, then you can look at my gun sight."

70
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,430
I rarely show it to anyone.

71
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,069
Silence!

72
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,189
Silence!

73
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,074
Japanese troops are coming!

74
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,355
Run!

75
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,240
Hide the grain and run!

76
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,635
Those demons are coming!

77
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,596
Hurry!

78
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,115
Listen! An approaching plane!

79
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,235
It trips me every time!

80
00:10:59,400 --> 00:10:59,991
What are you doing?

81
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,789
You want to die?

82
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,279
You could detonate that bomb!

83
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,357
It's been here for two years. Can a kick make it explode?

84
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,918
Can't you read the sign

85
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,310
"Men and Animals, Keep Away."

86
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,352
Can't you read?

87
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,030
"I was told this was"eight"."

88
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,750
"You're 8th Army, didn't you know?"

89
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,113
You're funny!

90
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,309
I'll show you...

91
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,875
"Two separate strokes make"eight"."

92
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,310
"Two connected strokes make"man"."

93
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,034
"Add one stroke to make"big"."

94
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,992
"Add two to make"sky"."

95
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,868
"What happens to"eight"now?"

96
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,229
I don't know.

97
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,872
"Anyway, separate strokes make "man", connected strokes make "eight"."

98
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,749
That's wrong.

99
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,037
"Separate stokes make "eight", connected strokes make "man"."

100
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,399
"See, you don't know either."

101
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,988
Wow!

102
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,558
Your breakfast is much richer than mine.

103
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,999
Here you go.

104
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,797
What a big cow!

105
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,520
Hide in the cellars what we can't take.

106
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,991
The cow is a real problem.

107
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,157
Let's leave it in the village.

108
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,195
The army will give you funds to feed it special grain.

109
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,115
"Comrade, give me a hand."

110
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,914
"In a couple of weeks, our army will strike back."

111
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,272
I'll return for the cow.

112
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,959
We must make a contract.

113
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,836
"You know, the cow is a donation from foreign friends."

114
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,718
The milk is for our wounded.

115
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,714
Hiding the wounded is easy.

116
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,189
But the cow is too big. It's different from our local cows.

117
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,599
"The village is a"stronghold". You'll manage."

118
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,150
We'll do our best

119
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,673
The cow will be returned to you unharmed.

120
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,518
Not to me.

121
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,158
To the Army.

122
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,674
How could this happen?

123
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,317
"Everyone dead, except the cow."

124
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,751
Move!

125
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,117
What are you doing?

126
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,835
Damn you

127
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,272
Who do you think you are?

128
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,870
You should have been roasted long ago!

129
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,752
What?

130
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,357
Let me see.

131
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,348
Are you mute?

132
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,716
Line up!

133
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,156
Time for bean lottery!

134
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,870
We follow the rules of our ancestors.

135
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,910
He who picks the red bean tends to the cow.

136
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,039
Patience to those who pick green beans.

137
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,990
Heaven will determine who will bear this duty.

138
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,872
Understand?

139
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,072
So?

140
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,348
Exactly 128 beans.

141
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:09,678
Fine.

142
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,551
Here's the red bean.

143
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,472
Pour them in.

144
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,792
One bean per man!

145
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,193
No women!

146
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,228
Why not?

147
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,472
Aren't we liberated now?

148
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,551
Women are free!

149
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,794
Keep quiet!

150
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,993
This is a dangerous task!

151
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,073
How can you hide such a big cow? So conspicuously foreign!

152
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,153
The Japanese are not stupid.

153
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,791
Loan me your cow for grinding.

154
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,029
No!

155
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,032
Everything clear?

156
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,876
I have an idea.

157
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,151
I have lots of dyes.

158
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,355
I can turn this cow yellow

159
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,710
to resemble a Chinese cow.

160
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,316
The Japanese would not notice.

161
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,874
No! Why not?

162
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,353
I'll do it myself.

163
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,154
I would give my life for the cow!

164
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,518
I have an idea.

165
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,988
I have been a doctor for many ears.

166
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,348
I have a potion to make it mute

167
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,358
without harming it.

168
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,272
Niu Er!

169
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,755
Why are you with the women? Come here!

170
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,076
He is busy!

171
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,149
I already have a cow. Leave me out.

172
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,474
You're not a woman!

173
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,359
Come here!

174
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,396
I'll do it!

175
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,359
What are you doing?

176
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,075
Here I am.

177
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,195
Not you.

178
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,789
You'll take all the milk for yourself!

179
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,199
I'll take Niu's place

180
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,631
"Niu Er, tell them"

181
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,113
Don't look.

182
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,309
Eat this.

183
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,439
It tastes bad because it's good for you.

184
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,633
Then do what you want.

185
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,990
Stay mute.

186
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,757
You're very contrary.

187
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,953
Just like Jiu.

188
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:15,632
Jiu?

189
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,273
"Call me"dear"."

190
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,435
Eat up and moo for me.

191
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,949
Go on.

192
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,677
Niu dear!

193
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,357
Niu dear!

194
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:34,953
Here you are.

195
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,516
You pest!

196
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,949
You want to kill me?

197
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,319
"Jiu, what bean did you get?"

198
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,234
No bean at all!

199
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,874
Who got the red bean?

200
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,671
Show your hands

201
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,315
Let's see!

202
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,154
Who is hiding it?

203
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,599
Niu Er has it!

204
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,479
Let me see.

205
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,999
It's in hs mouth!

206
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,317
That's a lie!

207
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,752
Spit it out!

208
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,517
He swallowed it!

209
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,712
Don't listen to their nonsense!

210
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:57,951
What?

211
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,271
Jiu...

212
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,193
I wanted children and a happy life with you.

213
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,990
All clear.

214
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,720
One of our units passed here already.

215
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,597
Exactly.

216
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,673
This is a stronghold. Anti-Japanese.

217
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,993
Our troops already cleared the area.

218
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,918
A big favor... We should thank them.

219
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,955
"Check the village, eliminate any danger."

220
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,554
We'll head out tomorrow morning.

221
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,430
"Yes, sir."

222
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,111
Forward march!

223
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,273
I heard you... It worked.

224
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,153
The antidote was good.

225
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,953
Let's go.

226
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,114
We can't stay here.

227
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,957
A wolf is a bad sign. What will happen now?

228
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,312
What's your problem?

229
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,550
Don't start...

230
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,309
I'll show you.

231
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,593
So many wounded...

232
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,749
What now?

233
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:58,917
Sir!

234
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,750
All clear ahead.

235
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,792
Good. Get some rest.

236
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,430
So?

237
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,598
No sign of the enemy in the village.

238
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,474
Good. Get some rest

239
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,751
"Excuse me, Captain."

240
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,758
I want to fight with the others.

241
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,916
Stay and take care of the wounded.

242
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,238
But I can fight!

243
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,908
That's an order. Understand?

244
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,191
"Yes, sir."

245
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,396
Commander...

246
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,911
We must advance...

247
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,877
The torches!

248
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,272
Otsuka

249
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,398
Go and see!

250
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,155
"It's your fault. By leaving, we could have avoided this."

251
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,397
I'll roast you yet!

252
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,230
"OK, I won't."

253
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,278
The torches!

254
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,037
Otsuka!

255
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,072
Go and see!

256
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,110
Where is the noise from?

257
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:09,990
Over there.

258
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,316
Damn cow!

259
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,956
Trying to get me killed?

260
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,189
Then stay there.

261
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,279
I won't come back.

262
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,113
I almost forgot...

263
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:02,236
"I lost my old cow and my home, deserve this money."

264
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:29,871
Over and done

265
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,915
Heaven's will.

266
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,749
Where could this foreign cow have come from?

267
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,796
Really strange.

268
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,032
They aren't native to China.

269
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,150
It's not a Chinese cow.

270
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,199
Anybody know how to milk a cow?

271
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,555
Excuse me...

272
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,439
We raised cattle back home.

273
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,790
Really?

274
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,589
Can you milk a cow?

275
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,873
Let's sing for the cow!

276
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,595
"We will win"

277
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,436
Without far of death!

278
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,919
"A pretty girl in the orchard"

279
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,789
Picking pretty peaches

280
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,954
"Sees tomcat doing tabby"

281
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,796
Meow meow here

282
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,429
Meow meow there

283
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,876
"Squad Three, assemble!"

284
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,118
Conserve the rations.

285
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,479
We return in two days.

286
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,229
Wait here for us.

287
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,270
Your mission is to protect the wounded and the cow.

288
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,869
Don't worry

289
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,880
The Chinese are sneaky.

290
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,075
Don't retaliate in case of attack.

291
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,476
Understand?

292
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,272
Drink.

293
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,269
Be strong.

294
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,709
They return in two days.

295
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,710
The pain!

296
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:25,997
Lkeda!

297
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,630
Hold on!

298
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,799
Let's go home alive!

299
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,433
"Kuroki, your post is crucial!"

300
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,428
Defend it with your life!

301
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,029
"Shibuya, did you feed the cow"

302
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,279
Do it!

303
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,914
Shibya! Enough!

304
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,159
Watch the gate!

305
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,550
So cunning!

306
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,029
Damned Chinese!

307
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,630
"Shibuya, the gate!"

308
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,996
The cow is gone!

309
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,629
Dumb-ass!

310
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,549
What are you doing?

311
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,355
"Sorry, sir!"

312
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,709
What destroys a country?

313
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,120
I don't know.

314
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,874
Frivolity and irresponsibility

315
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,551
I stumbled on it by accident

316
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,751
The war isn't in thatjar!

317
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,835
Be serious.

318
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,477
Could you see? Yes.

319
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,388
All wounded. Three still standing.

320
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,112
Let's go.

321
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,276
Where are you going

322
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,471
To report To Captain. Why?

323
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,198
They have a machine gun.

324
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,790
"If we get it, we'll be heroes."

325
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,390
Damned Chinese!

326
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,438
Come out!

327
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,279
What are you waiting for?

328
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,192
Save your ammunition

329
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,236
"Shibuya, watch the door!"

330
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,748
It's only an ambush!

331
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,997
No use mooing. I won't go back.

332
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,389
"You want me dead, killer cow!"

333
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,634
Everyone is dead. You know it.

334
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,111
I did what I promised.

335
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,357
Two people... Pow! Pow! Killed.

336
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,877
"If I go back, the village would become extinct."

337
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,272
Enough with your damned moos!

338
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,475
Go to hell!

339
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,030
I don't care

340
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,513
I must have eaten it in a past life.

341
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,997
So

342
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:59,834
Place these land mines around and bury them well.

343
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,237
"Shibuya, not too far from the entry."

344
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,519
Remember the positions.

345
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,868
"Protect me, bodhisattva Guanyin."

346
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,910
"Bodhisattva of Mercy, protect me."

347
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,436
How strange

348
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,198
I remember stealing grain this way as a child...

349
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,714
the tunnel seemed wider.

350
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,750
Don't make noise.

351
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,759
Keep quiet.

352
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,079
I'm back

353
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,192
Come here!

354
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,952
There' no one here.

355
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,675
No fooling around.

356
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,469
Stop eating.

357
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,709
Otsuka!

358
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,513
Someone's there!

359
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,829
We're not armed!

360
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,556
Beast!

361
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,998
He's running away!

362
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,317
"Kamada, where did he go?"

363
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,959
In the well!

364
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,076
Step back!

365
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,796
The Chief was right: It takes is discipline!

366
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,755
I'll kill it

367
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,315
That treasonous cow!

368
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,074
I'll kill you right now!

369
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,510
The cow seems hungry. Feed it.

370
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,628
"Kuroki, keep watch. I need sleep."

371
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,189
Damn!

372
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,831
"Otsuka, what did you do in Japan?"

373
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,193
"Anything I could, to make a living."

374
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,072
I was a student.

375
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,912
I don't know much about life.

376
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,795
A clear shot.

377
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,353
I can't miss.

378
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,712
You still have a lot to learn.

379
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,391
Your fingerprint is a promise.

380
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,351
Niu Er swears on his life...

381
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,749
Yours is the last remaining cow.

382
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,793
Protected from the Japanese.

383
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,949
Where did he hide it?

384
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,355
I know where!

385
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,669
That bastard dug a big cave in the mountains.

386
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:00,390
I discovered it

387
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,357
when I was hunting

388
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,155
Always 0:46:35:0500:46:40:10 keep their promise. I didn't promise anything!

389
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,313
You must!

390
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,997
Everyone must sacrifice for the revolution.

391
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,118
"Fine, he'll do it."

392
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,232
Your fingerprint now!

393
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,839
I don't want to!

394
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,472
Niu Er is stronger than you!

395
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:35,989
Whoever loses takes the cow!

396
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,118
"I say that first,"

397
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,712
we must find a man to train you!

398
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:44,838
Fine.

399
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,351
Let's do as the Chief says

400
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,790
"Niu takes care of the cow, the village appoints Jiu as his wife."

401
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:56,910
Why?

402
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,516
These are two totally different things.

403
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,714
"Today, marriage is a personal choice."

404
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,789
Nonsense!

405
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:05,957
I decide!

406
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,793
Let it be done!

407
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:11,795
I won't!

408
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,518
Heaven knows that I already have a grandfather!

409
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,796
I deserve a real marriage!

410
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,476
"I'm your grandfather's grandfather,"

411
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,995
I am Heaven here!

412
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,830
"Who would marry you, widow"

413
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,831
"Refuse, and we'll banish you."

414
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,799
You'll get three bucket of grain as dowry.

415
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,428
Convince Niu Er to accept the cow.

416
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,711
That's not enough.

417
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,513
I want his silver bracelet.

418
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,589
As a memento.

419
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,395
Or I won't marry him.

420
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:56,832
Fine.

421
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,116
No!

422
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,036
It's a family heirloom!

423
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,479
Too bad

424
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,159
Everyone bear witness!

425
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,280
Everyone bear witness!

426
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,793
No!

427
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,034
"Good morning, Otsuka."

428
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,873
I told you not to go out.

429
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,119
"Sorry, but a healthy cow needs to walk."

430
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,076
Don't be long.

431
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,475
"1: Loyalty is second nature for a soldier."

432
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:06,789
2: A soldier respects the rules of proper etiquette.

433
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:11,589
3: A soldier cultivates the art of weaponry.

434
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,878
Who are you?

435
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,878
What's going on?

436
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,276
It's the enemy!

437
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,789
How many are you?

438
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:14,358
"How many are you? Speak up, damned Chinese!"

439
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,469
Bastard!

440
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,917
What happened?

441
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,315
He attacked me from behind.

442
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,909
Who is he?

443
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,359
The enemy!

444
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,718
Should I stab him?

445
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:45,114
Consider him target practice

446
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,993
Stab him

447
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:05,909
"Stand up, Shibuya!"

448
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,199
You are not a student!

449
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,838
You are a soldier of the Empire!

450
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,755
That's an order!

451
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,070
Go!

452
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,798
Call Otsuka!

453
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:55,876
"Shibuya, water!"

454
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,270
It's just a flesh wound.

455
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,834
Shut up and look at me.

456
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:05,275
"You oaf... And you, act like a man!"

457
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:26,836
Lower your head.

458
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,068
I'll kill you

459
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,559
Don't shoot

460
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,790
"Shibuya, the rifle."

461
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,909
I'll show you how to use a bayonet.

462
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,356
Watch!

463
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,758
"Come on, Chinaman!"

464
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,756
I'll kill you!

465
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,398
"Captain, here's a dead villager."

466
00:54:46,419 --> 00:54:48,250
Jiu...

467
00:55:03,219 --> 00:55:04,971
Jiu...

468
00:55:19,099 --> 00:55:20,851
"Oh Momma..."

469
00:55:21,299 --> 00:55:23,096
Let's head south

470
00:55:24,219 --> 00:55:25,971
"Where roads are wide"

471
00:55:27,019 --> 00:55:29,658
And money is high

472
00:55:30,979 --> 00:55:32,776
Oh Momma

473
00:55:53,939 --> 00:55:57,614
The village has decided. So we'll obey.

474
00:56:20,579 --> 00:56:22,376
"Such a good life, you have."

475
00:56:22,819 --> 00:56:26,812
Easy and plentiful. That's why you're so big.

476
00:56:28,299 --> 00:56:30,096
You've never had grain before.

477
00:56:30,979 --> 00:56:32,776
Life with me is tough.

478
00:56:33,179 --> 00:56:34,976
Communist cows are so lucky!

479
00:56:39,499 --> 00:56:42,616
"This is home. We eat what we want, nothing to fear."

480
00:56:46,459 --> 00:56:48,179
What are you looking at?

481
00:56:48,179 --> 00:56:49,976
You are a cow of the 8th Army.

482
00:56:50,939 --> 00:56:52,691
You should act like one

483
00:56:53,579 --> 00:56:55,376
The Communists stress quality for all men.

484
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:58,176
But not for cows

485
00:56:58,939 --> 00:57:00,691
"I'm poor, so you'll have to eat hay."

486
00:57:02,499 --> 00:57:04,251
Peasant food.

487
00:57:05,099 --> 00:57:06,896
"Yellow Cow, eat up."

488
00:57:07,539 --> 00:57:10,975
But not so much that they'll notice.

489
00:57:30,419 --> 00:57:32,216
Wow...

490
00:57:32,259 --> 00:57:34,534
How did they get so big?

491
00:57:46,579 --> 00:57:48,331
What's wrong?

492
00:57:48,659 --> 00:57:50,456
Don't I have the right to some milk?

493
00:57:52,019 --> 00:57:53,816
"Like Jiu, you need discipline."

494
00:57:55,579 --> 00:57:59,254
Be good or I'll give the rest of your grain to Yellow Cow.

495
00:58:00,139 --> 00:58:01,936
"I can't touch Jiu's, but I can touch yours."

496
00:58:08,019 --> 00:58:11,773
"See, how I'm touching them."

497
00:58:12,379 --> 00:58:14,609
"Of course, I can touch them."

498
00:58:21,779 --> 00:58:23,371
What's up?

499
00:58:23,539 --> 00:58:25,018
Shame on you!

500
00:58:29,979 --> 00:58:31,651
Scratches to your face!

501
00:58:32,659 --> 00:58:34,058
And slaps to the mouth!

502
00:58:34,859 --> 00:58:36,611
Aren't you ashamed?

503
00:58:41,539 --> 00:58:43,291
Give me the silver bracelet.

504
00:58:44,899 --> 00:58:46,651
You'll get it

505
00:58:48,059 --> 00:58:49,856
after we're married.

506
00:58:52,379 --> 00:58:54,973
Give it to me or I'll report you.

507
00:58:55,059 --> 00:58:56,014
You fed the village grain

508
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:57,896
to your yellow cow

509
00:58:58,019 --> 00:58:59,259
And you're abusing the Communist cow!

510
00:58:59,259 --> 00:58:59,975
I'm not!

511
00:59:00,059 --> 00:59:00,379
"Yes, you are!"

512
00:59:00,379 --> 00:59:01,419
No!

513
00:59:01,419 --> 00:59:03,057
You touched her udders!

514
00:59:05,099 --> 00:59:06,896
Stop and listen to me!

515
00:59:20,499 --> 00:59:23,252
"Villagers, come out and hear!"

516
00:59:23,659 --> 00:59:25,411
Disgusting news!

517
00:59:26,379 --> 00:59:28,210
Don't believe this nonsense!

518
00:59:30,979 --> 00:59:33,368
He fed the village grain to his own cow

519
00:59:33,819 --> 00:59:35,537
and let the Communist cow go hungry!

520
00:59:36,619 --> 00:59:38,416
The very cow entrusted to us

521
00:59:45,979 --> 00:59:47,776
And he even touched her udders!

522
00:59:50,979 --> 00:59:53,857
Only the 8th Army has that right!

523
01:00:37,499 --> 01:00:39,296
Jiu...

524
01:00:44,859 --> 01:00:46,577
Go away!

525
01:00:47,499 --> 01:00:49,296
Leave me alone!

526
01:01:42,579 --> 01:01:44,376
Go away!

527
01:01:55,579 --> 01:01:57,376
Where are you going?

528
01:02:04,259 --> 01:02:06,056
Don't come back if you run away.

529
01:02:26,779 --> 01:02:29,379
"A pretty girl in the orchard"

530
01:02:29,379 --> 01:02:32,576
"Picking pretty peaches"

531
01:02:33,899 --> 01:02:35,651
Sees tomcat doing tabby

532
01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:38,571
"Meow meow her"

533
01:02:40,099 --> 01:02:41,851
"Meow meow there!""

534
01:02:53,579 --> 01:02:55,376
Shameful cow!

535
01:02:56,379 --> 01:02:59,371
"If I were you, I would kill myself."

536
01:02:59,899 --> 01:03:01,651
So insolent!

537
01:03:05,779 --> 01:03:07,531
"From now on,"

538
01:03:08,259 --> 01:03:09,738
you will obey me.

539
01:03:10,099 --> 01:03:12,249
Do as I tell you and give me milk.

540
01:03:12,819 --> 01:03:14,252
OK?

541
01:03:14,379 --> 01:03:17,257
Don't I feed you right?

542
01:03:18,299 --> 01:03:20,096
Enjoy yourself while you can.

543
01:04:09,099 --> 01:04:10,896
Refugee?

544
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:13,376
From where

545
01:04:22,379 --> 01:04:24,176
The smell brought you here...

546
01:04:25,499 --> 01:04:27,251
Have some.

547
01:04:44,899 --> 01:04:46,651
A real mother...

548
01:05:31,019 --> 01:05:32,816
Milk again!

549
01:05:42,259 --> 01:05:47,856
Where're from the other valley. I'm a doctor.

550
01:05:48,899 --> 01:05:50,651
"Well, you know how to remove corns."

551
01:05:51,299 --> 01:05:53,574
"Treat diseases, too."

552
01:05:54,579 --> 01:05:58,936
Our village was raided and burnt down by the Japanese.

553
01:05:59,299 --> 01:06:01,130
We fled for our lives.

554
01:06:02,859 --> 01:06:05,054
We haven't eaten for days.

555
01:06:06,139 --> 01:06:09,654
Human life isn't worth much

556
01:06:10,419 --> 01:06:14,492
"Thank goodness, your cow saved us."

557
01:06:14,859 --> 01:06:17,248
"It's like our mother, right?"

558
01:06:45,419 --> 01:06:49,935
The poor beast is doing badly.

559
01:06:50,619 --> 01:06:52,416
It eats very little grass

560
01:06:53,219 --> 01:06:56,177
and it gives too much milk. It's no surprise that it's sick.

561
01:07:01,379 --> 01:07:05,611
We won't be able to milk it for a while.

562
01:07:07,299 --> 01:07:10,291
Don't worry.

563
01:07:10,339 --> 01:07:13,058
It can give you one last bucket.

564
01:07:13,099 --> 01:07:16,216
No one will milk her anymore!

565
01:07:16,419 --> 01:07:22,813
Look at her! Feeding you made her this way. Go away!

566
01:07:22,979 --> 01:07:24,128
Where to?

567
01:07:24,219 --> 01:07:26,016
We'll slaughter it.

568
01:07:26,059 --> 01:07:28,698
"Big as it is, there will be enough meat"

569
01:07:28,939 --> 01:07:30,213
for 20 days.

570
01:07:31,579 --> 01:07:32,978
Go to hell

571
01:07:35,219 --> 01:07:36,259
You're re a beast!

572
01:07:36,259 --> 01:07:37,055
Why?

573
01:07:38,459 --> 01:07:39,130
Why?

574
01:07:39,859 --> 01:07:40,928
Tell me!

575
01:07:42,259 --> 01:07:44,090
Did you kill your mother after she breast-fed you?

576
01:07:44,619 --> 01:07:46,416
Tell me!

577
01:07:48,299 --> 01:07:50,130
I'll kill you first!

578
01:07:53,739 --> 01:07:56,128
It's not his fault.

579
01:07:57,019 --> 01:07:59,089
We all need to eat.

580
01:08:02,339 --> 01:08:04,728
"Go, all of you."

581
01:08:05,059 --> 01:08:06,856
You can see what's left of the cow.

582
01:08:07,459 --> 01:08:09,256
I did what I could for you.

583
01:08:10,059 --> 01:08:11,856
Don't ask for more

584
01:08:13,779 --> 01:08:15,531
"Please, just go"

585
01:08:22,379 --> 01:08:25,530
"Listen up, everyone..."

586
01:08:26,299 --> 01:08:30,087
Maybe we'll meet people in the next village.

587
01:08:30,699 --> 01:08:32,451
Let's go.

588
01:08:33,259 --> 01:08:36,774
"If we find food, children eat first!"

589
01:08:37,539 --> 01:08:40,258
Think of our hungry children!

590
01:08:41,499 --> 01:08:46,015
That poor man nearly killed his cow for us.

591
01:08:46,619 --> 01:08:52,569
I'll stay and try to cure it with some kind of medicine.

592
01:09:24,259 --> 01:09:26,409
Blood is clogging its heart and lungs.

593
01:09:27,579 --> 01:09:29,379
High internal temperature.

594
01:09:29,379 --> 01:09:31,768
It will take the right kind of herb.

595
01:09:32,419 --> 01:09:35,616
"Please, you must cure her"

596
01:09:39,219 --> 01:09:42,495
"I want to, but I don't have the medicine."

597
01:09:46,619 --> 01:09:51,295
Come with me. The Chief had all kinds of medicine!

598
01:09:52,699 --> 01:09:56,487
The cow shouldn't be left alone! You go!

599
01:10:18,819 --> 01:10:20,218
What?

600
01:10:21,219 --> 01:10:22,208
What?

601
01:10:25,499 --> 01:10:27,410
You're up to something bad!

602
01:10:40,779 --> 01:10:43,498
Is this how you thank me for feeding you?

603
01:10:43,779 --> 01:10:45,531
Bad people!

604
01:10:51,619 --> 01:10:53,416
I'll be back!

605
01:10:54,819 --> 01:10:56,571
I'll get you!

606
01:11:21,459 --> 01:11:25,498
Can a corn-removing scalpel be used to slay a cow?

607
01:11:27,379 --> 01:11:29,176
To protect the cowhide

608
01:11:29,579 --> 01:11:31,376
you must start from the muzzle.

609
01:11:53,219 --> 01:11:55,050
Bastard

610
01:11:56,099 --> 01:11:57,896
You don't have a heart!

611
01:11:59,619 --> 01:12:00,734
Think to kill the cook after the meal?

612
01:12:00,819 --> 01:12:01,410
Come here!

613
01:12:02,059 --> 01:12:03,378
"Don't touch that cow,"

614
01:12:05,139 --> 01:12:07,937
or I'll skin you alive!

615
01:12:08,779 --> 01:12:10,451
Fight like a man!

616
01:12:10,499 --> 01:12:11,568
Enough!

617
01:12:11,619 --> 01:12:15,248
"Once it is done, we'll calm him with some meat."

618
01:12:15,819 --> 01:12:16,695
Everyone

619
01:12:17,619 --> 01:12:18,210
happy!

620
01:12:46,899 --> 01:12:48,696
The cow's gone mad

621
01:13:05,579 --> 01:13:07,331
Bad-tempered like Jiu.

622
01:14:35,739 --> 01:14:37,457
Where have you been hiding?

623
01:14:39,179 --> 01:14:40,976
I've been looking for hours!

624
01:14:43,499 --> 01:14:47,538
What did they do to you? Those bastards...

625
01:14:51,419 --> 01:14:53,091
How did you get up here?

626
01:14:53,499 --> 01:14:55,296
Can you fly too?

627
01:14:56,899 --> 01:14:58,651
It's fine. Those bastards won't come here.

628
01:15:12,739 --> 01:15:15,458
That son of a bitch!

629
01:15:16,019 --> 01:15:17,452
He wants to kill us.

630
01:15:18,019 --> 01:15:19,975
The cow must be inside.

631
01:15:20,499 --> 01:15:21,932
Of course.

632
01:15:22,019 --> 01:15:23,499
"Gousheng,"

633
01:15:23,499 --> 01:15:26,059
"Er Qiang, capture him now"

634
01:16:27,019 --> 01:16:28,771
Go away

635
01:16:29,019 --> 01:16:32,455
The place is covered with Japanese land mines! Stop it!

636
01:16:32,699 --> 01:16:34,451
Or you'll all end up dead!

637
01:16:34,659 --> 01:16:36,411
Coward!

638
01:16:36,859 --> 01:16:38,895
We only wanted to eat your cow.

639
01:16:39,499 --> 01:16:41,296
And you killed my two brothers!

640
01:16:41,939 --> 01:16:44,169
I'll kill you!

641
01:16:44,499 --> 01:16:46,057
There's another one!

642
01:17:07,499 --> 01:17:09,296
Go away...

643
01:17:09,779 --> 01:17:11,531
There are land mines!

644
01:17:11,779 --> 01:17:14,247
Leave my cow alone!

645
01:17:14,459 --> 01:17:16,256
You can't come in.

646
01:17:16,859 --> 01:17:19,419
The explosions will attract bandits.

647
01:17:19,859 --> 01:17:21,656
Save yourself

648
01:17:25,539 --> 01:17:30,055
"The mines are everywhere, I don't know exactly where!"

649
01:17:31,219 --> 01:17:33,016
Just go!

650
01:17:39,219 --> 01:17:42,655
"Doctor, just hurry and go!"

651
01:17:47,539 --> 01:17:48,938
Liar!

652
01:17:49,019 --> 01:17:50,418
Why would I lie?

653
01:17:50,459 --> 01:17:51,779
Are you blind?

654
01:17:51,779 --> 01:17:53,531
You're trying to trick me!

655
01:19:19,179 --> 01:19:20,658
Mangy mongrel!

656
01:19:20,899 --> 01:19:21,968
You're crazy!

657
01:19:22,139 --> 01:19:23,936
People aren't for eating!

658
01:19:25,499 --> 01:19:26,170
Bastard!

659
01:19:26,979 --> 01:19:27,456
Go away

660
01:19:36,019 --> 01:19:37,691
Let's et out of here.

661
01:19:39,659 --> 01:19:41,377
Man ad beast have gone mad.

662
01:19:47,139 --> 01:19:49,334
"Let's go to the mountains, to the cave."

663
01:19:51,499 --> 01:19:53,251
We'll never return.

664
01:19:54,539 --> 01:19:56,097
What do you say?

665
01:19:57,019 --> 01:19:58,293
Tell me.

666
01:20:00,339 --> 01:20:01,818
"Niu Er, dear!"

667
01:20:10,939 --> 01:20:12,213
I need your help!

668
01:20:13,339 --> 01:20:13,851
Go away!

669
01:20:15,339 --> 01:20:16,772
Come here!

670
01:20:18,139 --> 01:20:20,255
You broke your promise.

671
01:20:21,739 --> 01:20:22,535
Come here

672
01:20:22,699 --> 01:20:26,135
Hurry and dig the hole. The Japanese are coming.

673
01:20:26,459 --> 01:20:28,370
I'll feed your cow.

674
01:20:29,019 --> 01:20:30,816
I will send it back to you soon.

675
01:20:31,779 --> 01:20:35,567
"If the mountain bandits come, we're finished."

676
01:20:36,299 --> 01:20:39,052
Just give them the yellow cow.

677
01:20:39,139 --> 01:20:40,254
Save yourself.

678
01:20:51,219 --> 01:20:51,731
Come on.

679
01:21:38,899 --> 01:21:40,651
Who's there?

680
01:21:54,219 --> 01:21:57,336
"So you like killing, you Japanese dog?"

681
01:21:59,499 --> 01:22:00,693
Don't want to kill anymore?

682
01:22:00,819 --> 01:22:02,889
Didn't you kill everyone here?

683
01:22:04,779 --> 01:22:08,135
"We were living peacefully, without harming you."

684
01:22:10,539 --> 01:22:11,289
Come here!

685
01:22:17,419 --> 01:22:20,855
And you? Not unruly anymore?

686
01:22:26,619 --> 01:22:27,847
"I was a student. I just arrived, I never killed anyone."

687
01:22:28,179 --> 01:22:30,010
This Japanese knows some Chinese!

688
01:22:30,859 --> 01:22:32,611
He writes well.

689
01:22:32,739 --> 01:22:33,410
Eight.

690
01:22:34,139 --> 01:22:35,857
I'm 8th Route Army.

691
01:22:35,979 --> 01:22:38,015
You're a dead man!

692
01:22:38,419 --> 01:22:40,216
There's no reason to kill each other!

693
01:23:24,899 --> 01:23:27,208
What kind of gun is this?

694
01:23:40,659 --> 01:23:41,455
Almost forgot...

695
01:23:48,739 --> 01:23:50,172
Open your eyes.

696
01:23:51,019 --> 01:23:52,771
I'll do this your way.

697
01:24:01,499 --> 01:24:03,057
My mother...

698
01:24:03,299 --> 01:24:04,652
My younger brother

699
01:24:05,299 --> 01:24:07,130
They are waiting or me.

700
01:24:08,699 --> 01:24:11,497
Give me my photo

701
01:24:12,379 --> 01:24:13,698
Don't show me that.

702
01:24:14,739 --> 01:24:15,376
It won't work.

703
01:24:16,179 --> 01:24:17,976
Your family?

704
01:24:18,979 --> 01:24:21,857
I used to have a family too!

705
01:24:25,819 --> 01:24:30,449
You murdered my pregnant aunt with a bayonet.

706
01:24:32,139 --> 01:24:35,814
So shut up! You must pay.

707
01:24:36,739 --> 01:24:38,491
For everything.

708
01:24:39,699 --> 01:24:40,893
"Uncle,"

709
01:24:41,659 --> 01:24:42,455
Chief!

710
01:24:42,899 --> 01:24:43,968
Help me!

711
01:24:45,179 --> 01:24:46,976
"Today, I avenge you all!"

712
01:24:51,619 --> 01:24:53,139
"Oh Momma"

713
01:24:53,139 --> 01:24:54,936
Let's head south

714
01:24:55,819 --> 01:24:58,891
"Where roads are wide And money is high"

715
01:25:00,339 --> 01:25:03,058
"So many mountains to climb...""

716
01:25:52,379 --> 01:25:56,531
Wait here. I'll check out the cave.

717
01:26:16,219 --> 01:26:17,015
Halt!

718
01:26:19,019 --> 01:26:19,929
Who are you?

719
01:26:20,659 --> 01:26:22,411
You scared me. Where are you from?

720
01:26:25,299 --> 01:26:26,812
Are you 8th Army

721
01:26:28,659 --> 01:26:30,854
I'm from the Nationalist Army. Who are you?

722
01:26:31,139 --> 01:26:34,097
I found that stuff on the way.

723
01:26:34,859 --> 01:26:38,374
I'm not a soldier. Stop threatening me!

724
01:26:39,859 --> 01:26:40,655
What's that?

725
01:26:41,779 --> 01:26:45,249
You were smart to hide here. This is my cave.

726
01:26:48,699 --> 01:26:50,132
That cow...

727
01:26:50,179 --> 01:26:52,010
It's so big!

728
01:26:52,219 --> 01:26:55,848
"Careful, she's very bad-tempered!"

729
01:27:03,219 --> 01:27:06,097
Fraternizing with the Japanese? Traitor!

730
01:27:07,099 --> 01:27:08,930
They're killing the Chinese

731
01:27:10,739 --> 01:27:12,491
Put that gun down

732
01:27:14,979 --> 01:27:16,776
Do you want to get killed?

733
01:27:18,019 --> 01:27:18,974
My brothers...

734
01:27:19,059 --> 01:27:20,856
What kind of gun is this?

735
01:27:20,939 --> 01:27:22,736
I will avenge them!

736
01:27:23,539 --> 01:27:25,177
It's not how it looks!

737
01:27:25,259 --> 01:27:27,090
Listen to me!

738
01:27:30,979 --> 01:27:33,777
"Uncle, Chief..."

739
01:27:34,779 --> 01:27:36,099
Help me!

740
01:27:36,099 --> 01:27:37,930
"Today, I will avenge you!"

741
01:27:54,739 --> 01:27:56,058
Don't touch her!

742
01:28:13,179 --> 01:28:15,010
Crazy Japanese

743
01:28:23,059 --> 01:28:23,650
Bullshit

744
01:28:24,099 --> 01:28:25,896
Don't take me for a fool!

745
01:28:26,099 --> 01:28:27,099
He cured my cow!

746
01:28:27,099 --> 01:28:28,088
Collaborator!

747
01:28:38,499 --> 01:28:40,296
Tell him to put the gun down!

748
01:28:40,739 --> 01:28:42,730
Or I'll shoot you too!

749
01:28:44,179 --> 01:28:45,328
Guns down both of you!

750
01:28:45,419 --> 01:28:46,488
What kind of gun is this?

751
01:28:47,779 --> 01:28:48,575
Two...

752
01:28:48,619 --> 01:28:50,371
Three!

753
01:28:56,259 --> 01:28:57,294
Get down!

754
01:28:59,899 --> 01:29:01,093
Get down!

755
01:30:02,659 --> 01:30:03,978
Jiu

756
01:30:04,419 --> 01:30:05,898
Where are you?

757
01:30:14,499 --> 01:30:16,137
Everything's fine.

758
01:30:20,299 --> 01:30:21,937
We're lucky.

759
01:31:51,659 --> 01:31:53,411
All together!

760
01:31:53,819 --> 01:31:55,616
Push!

761
01:32:23,059 --> 01:32:24,572
What is this about?

762
01:32:25,219 --> 01:32:27,016
A foreign cow mating with a Chinese cow?

763
01:32:27,939 --> 01:32:30,578
Sure it can! They're both cows.

764
01:32:31,059 --> 01:32:32,890
Reproduction is possible.

765
01:32:49,579 --> 01:32:51,331
I'll get you all!

766
01:33:17,659 --> 01:33:21,049
We'll never go down again.

767
01:34:01,779 --> 01:34:04,339
Men till the land and women weave cloth.

768
01:34:07,939 --> 01:34:10,772
This is how life should be

769
01:34:41,259 --> 01:34:44,695
So you wanted to kill me

770
01:35:23,859 --> 01:35:26,214
Then we'll all die together.

771
01:36:28,219 --> 01:36:30,050
I'll kill you all!

772
01:36:35,019 --> 01:36:36,452
Jiu!

773
01:36:37,059 --> 01:36:38,856
Momma!

774
01:38:15,379 --> 01:38:17,176
"Picking pretty peaches"

775
01:38:17,979 --> 01:38:19,731
"Sees tomcat doing tabby""

776
01:38:40,099 --> 01:38:41,214
Get up

777
01:38:57,819 --> 01:39:00,413
I forbid you to die

778
01:39:05,019 --> 01:39:06,247
Get up

779
01:39:23,179 --> 01:39:24,976
Do you want to freeze to death?

780
01:39:27,419 --> 01:39:29,216
Then get up!

781
01:40:43,659 --> 01:40:45,411
Listen...

782
01:40:48,899 --> 01:40:50,173
I want to know something.

783
01:40:50,979 --> 01:40:52,128
You...

784
01:40:53,699 --> 01:40:56,008
In your foreign country...

785
01:40:57,059 --> 01:40:58,287
How are you called?

786
01:41:02,379 --> 01:41:03,653
Do they call you Jiu?

787
01:41:07,659 --> 01:41:12,210
What's the name of your village?

788
01:41:16,939 --> 01:41:18,736
Do you miss your parents?

789
01:42:23,299 --> 01:42:25,176
"Captain, land mines ahead!"

790
01:42:25,579 --> 01:42:27,297
We can't advance

791
01:42:27,899 --> 01:42:29,412
How could there be landmine here?

792
01:42:30,019 --> 01:42:31,338
Query headquarters.

793
01:43:11,339 --> 01:43:13,773
Are you the 8th Route Army?

794
01:43:13,819 --> 01:43:17,209
Yes. We're now called the People's Liberation Army

795
01:43:18,259 --> 01:43:21,490
Have you come for the cow?

796
01:43:22,099 --> 01:43:23,930
I don't understand.

797
01:43:24,179 --> 01:43:30,095
"You were supposed to return in 10 days, seven years ago."

798
01:43:30,539 --> 01:43:31,654
Wait a minute.

799
01:43:34,499 --> 01:43:36,251
She belongs to you.

800
01:43:38,419 --> 01:43:40,216
We are the People's army.

801
01:43:40,419 --> 01:43:43,217
We don't take from the people!

802
01:43:43,899 --> 01:43:45,014
Hold on!

803
01:43:47,579 --> 01:43:49,058
What is it?

804
01:43:49,779 --> 01:43:56,537
This was written when the troops evacuated.

805
01:43:59,299 --> 01:44:04,134
All the villagers died. I brought the cow to the mountains.

806
01:44:04,379 --> 01:44:06,176
And there's this...

807
01:44:07,099 --> 01:44:10,216
I don't know who wrote this.

808
01:44:11,499 --> 01:44:14,013
My unit can't take this cow.

809
01:44:17,019 --> 01:44:20,136
"Listen, I'll make a military decision."

810
01:44:20,179 --> 01:44:22,693
The cow now belongs to you.

811
01:44:25,179 --> 01:44:29,092
The cow... She's mine?

812
01:44:29,619 --> 01:44:31,371
And the seal?

813
01:44:31,899 --> 01:44:32,490
What kind of gun is this?

814
01:44:33,139 --> 01:44:36,051
Your seal of agreement.

815
01:44:37,979 --> 01:44:38,934
How about a fingerprint?

816
01:44:40,259 --> 01:44:41,738
I'll give you my fingerprint.

817
01:44:48,819 --> 01:44:50,411
How's that?

818
01:44:51,579 --> 01:44:51,977
Let's go.

819
01:44:59,539 --> 01:45:00,494
What now?

820
01:45:05,539 --> 01:45:07,370
The cow and I...

821
01:45:07,579 --> 01:45:12,209
We'll stay in the mountains. We'll never go back down.

822
01:45:15,379 --> 01:45:17,176
You... do me a favor.

823
01:45:17,539 --> 01:45:20,372
Write something for me.

824
01:45:20,539 --> 01:45:21,051
What?

825
01:45:23,579 --> 01:45:25,331
Some characters...

826
01:45:27,579 --> 01:45:30,377
"For a tombstone, on a grave."

827
01:45:31,699 --> 01:45:33,769
"In memory of Niu"Er"(two)"

828
01:45:58,979 --> 01:46:00,617
Which is which?

829
01:46:11,899 --> 01:46:13,696
"In memory of Two"Niu"(Cow)"

830
01:46:19,179 --> 01:46:20,976
It's the same.

831
01:47:04,859 --> 01:47:06,656
Don't be afraid.

832
01:47:12,939 --> 01:47:14,736
Everything will be alright.
