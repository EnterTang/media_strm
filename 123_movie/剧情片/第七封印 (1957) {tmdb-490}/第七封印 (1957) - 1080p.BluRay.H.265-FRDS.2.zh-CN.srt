1
00:00:43,178 --> 00:00:46,713
第七封印
THE SEVENTH SEAL

2
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,212
【和合本 启示录8:1】
羔羊揭开第七印的时候……
Ad wen the Lamb opened the seventh seal -

3
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:09,211
天上寂静……
- there was in heaven a silence -

4
00:02:09,348 --> 00:02:13,395
约有二刻
- which lasted about the space of half an hour.

5
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:19,111
【和合本 启示录8:6】
拿着七枝号的七位天使……
And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets -

6
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:22,241
就预备要吹
- prepared themselves to sound.

7
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:34,478
- 你是谁？ - 我是死神
- Who are you? - I a Death.

8
00:04:35,362 --> 00:04:39,611
- 你是来取走我魂魄的吗？
- 我已经伴随在你左右很久了
- Have you come to fetch me? - I have long walked at your side.

9
00:04:39,744 --> 00:04:43,197
- 我知道 - 你准备好了吗？
- That I know. - Are you ready?

10
00:04:43,876 --> 00:04:47,163
我的身体已经准备好了 但是我的心却没有
My body is, not myself.

11
00:04:55,104 --> 00:04:59,151
- 等一下 - 你们都这么说
- Wait a moment. - You all say that.

12
00:04:59,277 --> 00:05:03,407
- 但是我不会等的 - 你下象棋，对吗？
- But I leave no respite. - You play chess, don't you?

13
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:08,950
- 你怎么知道？ - 从画和民歌中知道的
- How do you know? - From paintings and folk songs.

14
00:05:09,085 --> 00:05:13,548
是的，我是个真正的象棋高手
Yes, I'm actually quite a skillful chess player.

15
00:05:13,676 --> 00:05:17,628
- 不会比我强 - 那我们何不比试比试？
- Not more so than me. - Why play chess with me?

16
00:05:17,766 --> 00:05:21,718
- 正有此意 - 很好
- That's my affair. - You are right.

17
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:26,445
条件是在和你下棋时我得活着
The condition is I live as long as I resist you.

18
00:05:26,573 --> 00:05:29,778
如果我赢了，你就放了我
If I conquer you, you free me.

19
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:39,626
你执黑
You have black.

20
00:05:39,762 --> 00:05:43,429
再合适不过了，不是吗？
It's most appropriate, not so?

21
00:06:54,887 --> 00:06:59,635
碾碎那些在床第间的叹息
Squeezed twixt the thighs on a bed of sighs

22
00:06:59,771 --> 00:07:03,023
那是成为像我一样的男子汉
That's the only way to be

23
00:07:03,151 --> 00:07:05,940
的唯一方式
For a man like me

24
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:16,211
我们的君主高高在上 他有一些害羞
Our Lord sits up high He is somewhat shy

25
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:22,014
但是撒旦，你的亲信 确保你不会孤单
But Satan, your crony ensures you won't be Ionely

26
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:26,981
他们谈到了在Farjestad 发生的一些可怕的事情
They talk of omens and other horrors in Farjestad.

27
00:07:27,108 --> 00:07:30,194
昨晚有两匹马吃掉了另一匹马
Two horses ate one another last night.

28
00:07:30,322 --> 00:07:35,485
墓地里的墓穴被打开了 遗骨到处散落
Graves had been opened in the cemetery and remains scattered about.

29
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,748
昨天下午天空中出现了四个太阳
There were four suns in the heavens yesterday afternoon.

30
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,665
你能告诉我去旅馆的路怎么走吗？
Can you tell me the way to the inn?

31
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:30,619
- 他说了怎么走了吗？ - 没有
- Did he indicate the way? - Not exactly.

32
00:08:30,756 --> 00:08:33,462
- 他说了什么？ - 什么也没说
- What did he say? - Nothing.

33
00:08:33,594 --> 00:08:37,012
- 他是哑巴吗？ - 不，不能那么说
- Was he dumb? - No, one can't say that.

34
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:41,557
我得说他非常善言
I'd say that he was extremely well-spoken.

35
00:08:41,691 --> 00:08:47,199
是的，非常善言 但是不得不承认他的话非常严肃
Yes, well-spoken. But the speech he made was dour. I have to say.

36
00:10:18,562 --> 00:10:23,108
早晨好，你吃早饭了吗？
Good morning. Have you had any breakfast?

37
00:10:23,236 --> 00:10:27,651
真不幸，我不能吃草 为什么你不教教我呢？
Unfortunately, I can't eat grass. Can't you teach me?

38
00:10:27,786 --> 00:10:34,160
手头紧了，这些地方的人 对艺术都不感兴趣
Things are tight. People aren't interested in art in these parts.

39
00:11:28,137 --> 00:11:32,517
米亚，起来！ 我必须告诉你我看见了什么
Mia, wake up! I've seen something I must tell you about.

40
00:11:32,644 --> 00:11:36,097
- 出什么事了？ - 我刚才出现了幻觉
- Has something happened? - I've had a vision.

41
00:11:36,234 --> 00:11:40,483
不，不是幻觉，那和真的一样
No, not a vision. It was like it was real.

42
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:44,532
知道了…你又有幻觉了
I see... Have you had another vision?

43
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:50,080
总之，我看到她了
I saw her, anyway.

44
00:11:50,215 --> 00:11:55,557
- 谁，你看到谁了？ - 圣母玛利亚
- Who? Who did you see? - The Holy Virgin Mary.

45
00:11:57,144 --> 00:12:00,847
- 真的？ - 她近得我都可以摸到她
- Really? - She was so close I could touch her.

46
00:12:00,984 --> 00:12:04,521
她头戴金冠，身上披着蓝色的花衣
She had a crown of gold and a blue dress with flowers -

47
00:12:04,656 --> 00:12:08,490
她赤着脚，皮肤微黑
- and she was barefoot and had small brown hands.

48
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:12,407
她牵着那个小孩，教他走路
She held the child and taught him to walk.

49
00:12:12,545 --> 00:12:16,759
她看到我看她，还对我笑
Then she saw that I'd seen her and she smiled at me.

50
00:12:16,885 --> 00:12:22,131
我的眼中充满了泪水，当我 擦去它们时，她消失了
I got tears in my eyes and when I wiped them away, she disappeared.

51
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:26,732
到处都变得非常非常宁静
And it became utterly, utterly quiet everywhere.

52
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:32,023
无论天空还是大地 你能想象吗？
In heaven and on earth. Can you understand that?

53
00:12:33,204 --> 00:12:39,293
- 你出现了幻觉 - 你不相信我，但那是真的
- You have an imagination. -You don't believe me, but it was real.

54
00:12:39,423 --> 00:12:43,838
不是你所说的那种真实 而是另一种
Not your kind of reality, but another reality.

55
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:50,144
就像你上次说魔鬼用它的尾巴 把我们的马车轮子涂成红色一样
Like when you said the Devil painted our wagon wheels red using his tail.

56
00:12:50,274 --> 00:12:52,647
提那个干什么？
Why bring that up?

57
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:57,574
- 你的指甲里就有红色颜料 - 对，那次是假的
- Red paint was under your nails. - Yes, that time it was made up.

58
00:12:57,704 --> 00:13:02,416
我那样做是为了要你相信 我所看到的真实景象
I did it so you'd believe in my other visions. The real ones.

59
00:13:02,545 --> 00:13:08,053
控制一下你的幻想吧 不然别人会把你当傻瓜看
Control your visions, or you'll be taken for a fool - which you aren't.

60
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:12,844
起码到现在，没人知道这些
At least not yet, as far as I know. But one never knows.

61
00:13:13,063 --> 00:13:18,523
我那不是幻想！ 我不可能让圣女来救赎
I didn't ask for my visions! I can't help the Holy Virgin revealing herself -

62
00:13:18,655 --> 00:13:22,441
还有那些天使，魔鬼 喜欢和我呆在一起
- and that angels and devils like to be with me.

63
00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:28,122
我不止一次说过早上我需要睡觉！
Haven't I said it once and for all that I need to sleep in the morning?

64
00:13:28,255 --> 00:13:32,089
我要求你，我请求你 但是一点用也没有
I've asked you, begged you, but nothing helps.

65
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,516
所以我现在要说…安静！
That's why I'm now saying... quiet!

66
00:13:47,662 --> 00:13:51,709
米克尔，米克尔，米克尔…
Mikael, Mikael, Mikael...

67
00:14:00,934 --> 00:14:06,358
- 他该过的比我们好
- 米克尔将来会是个伟大的杂技演员
- He should have a better life than us. - Mikael will be a great acrobat.

68
00:14:06,485 --> 00:14:11,066
或许是一个伟大的魔术师 会变最不可思议的戏法
Or maybe a juggler who accomplishes the only impossible trick.

69
00:14:11,202 --> 00:14:15,701
- 什么样的戏法？ - 让一个球悬浮在空中
- What trick is that? - Make one ball remain still in the air.

70
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:21,508
- 那不可能
- 对我们来说不可能，但他可以
- It's impossible. - For us it is. But not for him.

71
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,306
你的白日梦…
You and your fantasies...

72
00:14:26,435 --> 00:14:32,228
我昨晚又作了一首新歌 几乎整晚没睡
I made up a new song last night. I lay awake almost all night.

73
00:14:32,362 --> 00:14:37,572
- 你想听听吗？ - 唱吧，我很想听
- Do you want to hear my song? - Sing it. I'm really curious.

74
00:14:37,704 --> 00:14:45,087
一只鸽子栖息在盛夏的百合上
There sits a dove on the lilly In the midst of summer

75
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:49,466
她唱着赞美基督的美妙歌曲
She sings her fair song of Jesus Christ

76
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:54,394
天堂如此的欢喜
There is great rejoicing in heaven

77
00:14:56,319 --> 00:15:01,661
- 米亚，你睡着了吗？ - 这歌很美
- Mia, are you asleep? - It was a very beautiful song.

78
00:15:01,786 --> 00:15:06,000
- 我还没唱完呢 - 我只是稍微有点困了
- It's not finished yet. - I'm just going to sleep a little more.

79
00:15:06,127 --> 00:15:10,507
- 你可以晚点再唱剩下的部分 - 你除了睡就是睡
- You can sing the rest later. - You just sleep and sleep.

80
00:15:12,387 --> 00:15:16,968
这个装扮怎么样？ 我就是问问
Is this disguise worthy of an actor? I'm only asking.

81
00:15:17,104 --> 00:15:21,270
- 如果牧师不给钱，我就不干了 - 你演死神吗？
- If the priests didn't pay, I'd refuse. - Are you playing Death?

82
00:15:21,403 --> 00:15:25,949
吓吓那些有钱的体面人
Frighten decent people out of their wits with such nonsense.

83
00:15:26,077 --> 00:15:30,077
- 什么时候？
- 在EIsinore的All Saints节日上
- When are we going to do it? - At the All Saints festival in Elsinore.

84
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:33,662
就在教堂前的台阶上，还不赖
On the actual church steps. Not bad.

85
00:15:33,798 --> 00:15:38,344
为什么不是些艳舞之类的？
人们喜欢看而且也有意思
Why not something bawdy? People like it and it's funnier.

86
00:15:38,473 --> 00:15:43,138
傻瓜，那里现在瘟疫蔓延
Idiot. There's an evil sickness about -

87
00:15:43,356 --> 00:15:47,652
牧师要宣讲严肃的死亡和信仰的问题
- and priests are preaching grim death and moral bellyaches.

88
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:52,279
- 我们演什么？ - 你们演人的灵魂
- What roles will we play? - You're the human soul, you twit.

89
00:15:52,413 --> 00:15:57,921
- 说真的，那是个坏角色 - 谁决定的？谁是老板？
- Naturally it's a bad role. - Who decides? Who's the manager?

90
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:06,435
你们这些傻瓜，忘掉那些规矩吧 生命的细线是非常脆弱的
You fools, keep this law in mind Life's thread is of the weakest kind

91
00:16:06,562 --> 00:16:10,182
你们会发现生命很短暂
Life is short, you will find

92
00:16:11,486 --> 00:16:16,317
女人们会喜欢我这种打扮吗？ 我就是问问
Will women love me in this costume? I'm only asking.

93
00:16:28,431 --> 00:16:33,179
约瑟夫，别说话 什么也别说
Jof? Stand perfectly still. Don't say anything.

94
00:16:33,315 --> 00:16:38,110
- 我安静的像只老鼠 - 我爱你…
- I'm quiet as a mouse. - I love you...

95
00:17:06,537 --> 00:17:09,872
- 你在画什么？ - 死神的舞蹈
- What are you painting? - The dance of Death.

96
00:17:10,001 --> 00:17:13,787
-那是死神吗？
-是的，他一边跳舞一边带走他们所有人
-That's Death?
-Yes, he dances away with them all.

97
00:17:13,924 --> 00:17:18,803
- 为什么画这些？
- 提醒人们他们就要死了
- Why paint such daubings? - To remind people they will die.

98
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:23,979
- 那不会使他们高兴的
- 为什么总要取悦他们呢？
- That won't make them happier. - Why always make them happy?

99
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:28,607
- 为何不吓吓他们
- 他们最多闭上眼就行了
- Why not frighten them a bit? - They'll just close their eyes then.

100
00:17:28,741 --> 00:17:34,165
相信我，他们一定会看的 一个头骨远比通奸更有吸引力
Believe me, they'll look. A skull is more interesting than a naked wench.

101
00:17:34,292 --> 00:17:39,752
- 如果吓到他们呢？
- 他们就会越想越害怕
- And if you frighten them? - They'll think and be more frightened.

102
00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:43,422
- 然后扑进牧师的怀抱 - 这我不管
- And rush into the priest's embrace. - Not my business.

103
00:17:43,557 --> 00:17:48,352
- 你只画死神的舞蹈
- 我只是想展示那是怎么样的
- You're just painting Death's dance. - I'm only showing how it is.

104
00:17:48,482 --> 00:17:54,191
- 你会惹恼一些人的
- 那么我会再画些轻松的
- You'll anger certain people. - Then I'll paint something cheerful.

105
00:17:54,325 --> 00:17:58,990
人总是要活命的 至少在瘟疫找到你之前是的
One has to make a living. At least until the plague claims you.

106
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:02,710
瘟疫？可怕的…
The plague? That's horrifying...

107
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:07,172
你可以看到那些病人脖子上的疖子
You should see the boil on the neck of the sick.

108
00:18:07,305 --> 00:18:13,928
看看他们是怎样感染的
See how the body contracts, until his limbs become a rope of madness.

109
00:18:16,112 --> 00:18:20,361
- 看上去糟透了 - 是啊…糟透了
- It doesn't look good. - Yes... It doesn't look good.

110
00:18:20,494 --> 00:18:24,161
他试图撕裂他自己
He's trying to tear the bubo out of his bed.

111
00:18:24,292 --> 00:18:29,420
他咬自己的手 用指甲撕开皮肤
He gnaws at his hands, rips out his veins with his nails.

112
00:18:29,551 --> 00:18:33,467
他的尖叫随处可闻
His scream is heard everywhere.

113
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,637
- 你害怕了吗？ - 害怕？我？
- Are you scared? - Scared? Me?

114
00:18:36,771 --> 00:18:40,985
你不了解我，那些是什么东西？
You don't know me. What nonsense is that you've painted?

115
00:18:41,112 --> 00:18:44,982
那些是说人们认为…
The strange thing is that people see -

116
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,490
瘟疫是上帝降临的惩罚
- the plague as a punishment from God.

117
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:55,427
那些病人一路走一路鞭打自己 以祈求上帝的怜悯
Supplicants trail through the land and whip themselves into God's favour.

118
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,551
- 他们打自己？ - 是的，看上去太糟了
- They beat themselves? - Yes, it's an awful sight.

119
00:19:00,687 --> 00:19:04,557
当他们走过来时你就想躲开
You want to run and hide when they come.

120
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:09,693
能打断一下吗？ 我今天一直在喝水
Have you got any snaps? I've been drinking water all day.

121
00:19:09,827 --> 00:19:15,335
- 我就像只沙漠中的骆驼一样干渴 - 你有些害怕了
- I'm thirsty as a camel in the desert. - You did get a little scared, after all.

122
00:19:44,802 --> 00:19:49,846
我想尽可能坦诚地忏悔 但是我的心空空如也
I want to confess as honestly as I can, but my heart is empty.

123
00:19:51,313 --> 00:19:56,940
空虚就像我面前的一面镜子
And emptiness is a mirror turned to my own face.

124
00:19:57,073 --> 00:20:02,830
我看到了我自己… 我被厌恶和恐惧所俘获
I see myself... and am seized by disgust and fear.

125
00:20:08,008 --> 00:20:13,765
由于我对人民的漠不关心 我已被排斥在社会之外
Through my indifference for people, I've been placed outside of their society.

126
00:20:15,186 --> 00:20:20,646
现在我生活在一个幽灵的世界 我的梦境和思想都被占据
Now I live in a ghost world, enclosed in my dreams and imaginings.

127
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:25,610
- 不管怎样，你不想死 - 是的，我不想
- Despite that, you don't want to die. - Yes, I want to.

128
00:20:25,746 --> 00:20:29,247
- 你在期待什么？ - 我需要知识
- What are you waiting for? - I want knowledge.

129
00:20:30,545 --> 00:20:35,008
- 你想要保证 - 随便你怎么说
- You want guarantees. - Call it what you like.

130
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:44,557
仅凭一人的感觉想去 理解上帝的意图真的这么难吗？
Is it so terribly inconceivable to comprehend God with one's senses?

131
00:20:44,694 --> 00:20:51,697
为什么他总藏在半真半假的承诺 和从未实现过的奇迹背后呢？
Why does He hide in a cloud of half-promises and unseen miracles?

132
00:20:51,831 --> 00:20:55,582
当我们缺乏信仰的时候 又如何守信呢？
How can we believe in the faithful when we lack faith?

133
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:59,665
我们将会怎样，谁会去相信？
What will happen to us who want to believe, but cannot?

134
00:20:59,803 --> 00:21:03,589
难道要相信那些我们 不想也不能相信的事情吗？
What about those who neither want to nor can believe?

135
00:21:03,726 --> 00:21:06,479
为什么我不能杀死心中的上帝？
Why can't I kill God in me?

136
00:21:06,606 --> 00:21:10,273
为何他使我蒙羞？
Why does He live on in me in an humiliating way -

137
00:21:10,404 --> 00:21:14,238
尽管我想要把他从我心中抹去
- despite my wanting to evict Him from my heart?

138
00:21:14,369 --> 00:21:20,208
为什么他总像一个 我无法摆脱的嘲笑者？
Why is He despite all, a mocking reality I can't be rid of?

139
00:21:20,337 --> 00:21:24,717
- 你在听吗？ - 我在听
- Do you hear? - I hear you.

140
00:21:24,845 --> 00:21:30,721
我需要真理！不是信仰 不是承诺，而是真理
I want knowledge! Not faith, not assumptions, but knowledge.

141
00:21:30,855 --> 00:21:36,731
我希望上帝能伸出他的手 露出他的脸，和我说话
I want God to stretch out His hand, uncover His face and speak to me.

142
00:21:36,865 --> 00:21:42,111
- 但是他仍然沉默 - 我在黑暗中呼唤他
- But He remains silent. - I call out to Him in the darkness.

143
00:21:42,249 --> 00:21:47,246
- 但似乎没有人在那里 - 或许那没有任何人
- But it's as if no one was there. - Perhaps there isn't anyone.

144
00:21:47,382 --> 00:21:50,171
那么生命真是荒诞而可怕
Then life is a preposterous horror.

145
00:21:50,304 --> 00:21:55,728
没有人可以活着面对死神 了解一切都是虚幻的
No man can live faced with Death, knowing everything's nothingness.

146
00:21:55,855 --> 00:21:58,976
大部分人认为既没有死神也没有虚幻
Most people think neither of Death nor nothingness.

147
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:03,905
但是有一天当你站在生死边缘
But one day you stand at the edge of life and face darkness.

148
00:22:04,035 --> 00:22:09,032
- 那一天 - 我明白你的意思
- That day. - I understand what you mean.

149
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:12,587
我们必须构筑一个对抗恐惧的偶像
We must make an idol of our fear -

150
00:22:12,716 --> 00:22:16,383
而那个偶像我们称之为上帝
- and that idol we shall call God.

151
00:22:16,515 --> 00:22:19,601
你太多虑了
You are worried.

152
00:22:19,728 --> 00:22:25,567
死神今早来看我，我们一起下了象棋
Death came to see me this morning. We played chess together.

153
00:22:25,697 --> 00:22:30,991
我所学到的东西使我能完成一些事
The grace I received allows me to accomplish something.

154
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:36,712
我的一生都在寻找、希望…
All my life I've been searching, wondering -

155
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,045
没有目的和利害关系的交谈
- talking without meaning or context.

156
00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:46,636
但一无所获。
我这样说 没有苦闷和自责的意思
It has been nothing. Yes, I say so without bitterness or self-reproach -

157
00:22:46,774 --> 00:22:51,070
因为我知道大部分人的人生都是如此
- as I know that almost all of people's lives are made this way.

158
00:22:52,074 --> 00:22:57,783
但是我想用这余下的生命 做点有意义的事情
But I want to use my respite for one meaningful act.

159
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:03,795
那就是为什么你要和死神下象棋
That's why you are playing chess with the Devil.

160
00:23:03,927 --> 00:23:09,720
他很有谋略和技巧 但是到现在我还没有输一个子
He's a difficult and skillful tactician, but so far I have not surrended a piece.

161
00:23:10,605 --> 00:23:14,652
你怎么能在游戏中蒙骗死神？
How can you outwit the Devil in your game?

162
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:18,993
我移动了国王和骑士
I'm playing a combination of bishop and knight -

163
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:23,499
他没有发现，下一手 就可以让他的侧翼暴露出来
- that he hasn't noticed yet. I'll expose his flank in the next move.

164
00:23:25,881 --> 00:23:29,216
我会记住的
I'll remember that.

165
00:23:33,936 --> 00:23:38,731
你是个叛徒…你欺骗了我
You're a traitor... and you cheated me.

166
00:23:39,946 --> 00:23:44,943
但是我们还会见面 我会想到方法的
But we'll meet again. And I'll find a way.

167
00:23:45,497 --> 00:23:50,162
我们会在旅馆见面 继续我们的棋局
We'll meet at the inn. We'll continue our game then.

168
00:23:56,808 --> 00:24:01,971
这是我的手，我可以控制它…
This is my hand. I can move it...

169
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:06,357
我的血液涌入其中
My blood gushes in it.

170
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:09,943
太阳还高高挂在天上…
The sun is still high in the sky...

171
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,828
而我…我，安东尼斯.布莱克
And I... I, Antonius Block...

172
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,550
要和死神下棋
...am playing chess with the Devil.

173
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:25,637
我主人和我一直在国外
My master and I have been abroad.

174
00:24:25,773 --> 00:24:30,354
你知道吗？我亲爱的…皮克多
Do you understand, my dear... Pictor?

175
00:24:30,489 --> 00:24:33,942
- 十字军 - 正是
- The crusades. - Exactly.

176
00:24:34,078 --> 00:24:37,496
整整10年 蛇咬我们…
For 10 years we let snakes bite us -

177
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:41,578
昆虫蛰我们，动物袭击我们 野蛮人屠杀我们
- insects sting us, animals maul us, heathens slaughter us -

178
00:24:41,716 --> 00:24:47,140
酒毒害我们，女人影响我们 虱子以我们为食，炎热使我们腐烂…
- the wine poison us, women infect us, lice eat us, fever rot us...

179
00:24:47,267 --> 00:24:52,062
- 所有这一切，以上帝的名义 - 以上帝的名义
- Everything... in the name of God. - In the name of God.

180
00:24:54,154 --> 00:25:00,695
十字军东征真是个愚蠢的主意 只有空想家才想得出
Our crusade was so stupid, only an idealist could have invented it.

181
00:25:06,132 --> 00:25:10,844
- 就像这场瘟疫一样可怕 - 比那还槽
- All this about the plague is awful. - It's worse than that.

182
00:25:12,184 --> 00:25:16,813
哦，也许… 你总是坐在你的屁股上
Oh, yes... It's always your own arse you sit on.

183
00:25:16,942 --> 00:25:22,865
- 一个伟大的真理 - 你的屁股
- A great truth. - Your own arse. Your own arse.

184
00:25:23,995 --> 00:25:28,707
- 一个深刻的真理 - 这是乔恩的乡绅
- A profound truth... - Here is Jons the squire.

185
00:25:28,837 --> 00:25:33,585
他对着死神大笑，嘲笑君主 讥笑自己，对女孩们微笑
He grins at Death, guffaws at the Lord, laughs at himself, smiles at the girls.

186
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,052
他的世界里没有什么值得相信
――除了他自己
His world is believable to no one but himself.

187
00:25:38,186 --> 00:25:41,521
每个人都是荒谬的甚至他自己
Ridiculous to everyone, even himself.

188
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:45,899
无论天堂或是地狱 都是无关紧要，无意义的…
Meaningless in heaven and indifferent in hell...

189
00:26:11,742 --> 00:26:14,661
你的酒坛很臭，怎么回事？
Your stew stinks, what's it for?

190
00:26:15,248 --> 00:26:19,200
她很邪恶
She was joined in flesh with the Evil One.

191
00:26:19,338 --> 00:26:23,718
- 现在她被抓起来了 - 她会在早上被烧死
- And now she's in the stocks. - She will burn in the morning.

192
00:26:23,845 --> 00:26:28,889
- 但是我们必须要驱走魔鬼
- 用这些臭气熏天的东西吗？
- But we must keep the Devil away. - With that stinking brew?

193
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:33,235
最好的原料： 一只大黑狗的血
The best stuff; blood and guts of a big black dog.

194
00:26:33,361 --> 00:26:38,156
邪恶的家伙不能忍受这味道
The... the Evil One can't bear the smell.

195
00:26:38,286 --> 00:26:40,957
我也不能
Me neither.

196
00:26:49,305 --> 00:26:52,391
你看到魔鬼了吗？
Have you seen the Devil?

197
00:26:52,518 --> 00:26:54,981
- 别和她说话 - 有那么危险吗？
- Don't talk to her? - Is it so dangerous?

198
00:26:54,981 --> 00:27:01,491
我不知道，可是她看起来 会把瘟疫带给我们
I don't know, but she's seen as guilty of the plague that has befallen us.

199
00:27:33,603 --> 00:27:37,601
Oh, fate is a reprobate You my friend an unfortunate

200
00:27:37,774 --> 00:27:43,361
Now you bound in haste Now worms lay you to waste

201
00:27:44,739 --> 00:27:49,359
- 你非唱不可吗？ - 不是…
- Must you sing? - No...

202
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:56,862
为什么你那么惊讶的样子？ 因为我从死人手上偷东西？
Why do you look so surprised? I steal from the dead.

203
00:29:56,996 --> 00:30:00,782
这几天收获很不错
It's quite a rewarding domain these days.

204
00:30:02,922 --> 00:30:06,625
你想去告发我吗？没用的
You're thinking of telling tales in the village? It won't help.

205
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:12,102
每个人现在都自身难保 非常简单
Each one of us saves his own skin. It's that simple.

206
00:30:14,191 --> 00:30:18,654
别想叫，没有人会听到 上帝也不会
Don't try to scream. No one will hear you, neither God nor man.

207
00:30:18,782 --> 00:30:21,987
这没什么好惊讶的
It's nothing to be surprised about.

208
00:30:27,046 --> 00:30:30,381
我认识你 尽管已经很久了
I recognize you, even though it was long ago.

209
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:34,261
你是瑞沃 从Roskilde的神学院来的
You're Raval from the seminary in Roskilde.

210
00:30:34,392 --> 00:30:39,638
我说的对吗？
Mirabilis,Caelestis et Diabilis Doctor Mirabilis, Caelestis et Diabilis. Am I not right?

211
00:30:41,487 --> 00:30:48,075
你鼓动我的主人去参加神圣的十字军
You convinced my master to go to the Holy Land on an honourable crusade.

212
00:30:50,836 --> 00:30:54,752
看上去你不开心？
Are you worried? Butterflies in your belly?

213
00:30:56,053 --> 00:31:00,599
现在我想这10年是毫无意义的浪费
Now I understand the meaning of these 1 0 years that I thought wasted.

214
00:31:00,728 --> 00:31:03,980
我们已经受够了
We had it too good, we were too content.

215
00:31:04,108 --> 00:31:07,978
主想惩罚我们的自满
The Lord wanted to punish our self-satisfied pride.

216
00:31:08,115 --> 00:31:13,457
他要你来用毒液毒害骑士
He sent you to spit your heavenly venom and to poison the knight.

217
00:31:13,582 --> 00:31:17,534
- 那是美好的信仰
- 但是现在就更好了，不是吗？
- It was in good faith. - But now you know better, not so?

218
00:31:17,673 --> 00:31:24,676
现在你是一个贼，对你 这种坏人再合适不过的职业
Now you're a thief, a more suitable occupation for wretches and villains.

219
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:28,228
我说的不对吗？
Am I not right?

220
00:31:30,736 --> 00:31:34,071
不管怎么说，我不是个嗜杀的人
By all means. I am not bloodthirsty.

221
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:39,827
下次我会在你的脸上做个记号 像对其他和你一样的小人做的一样
Next time I'll mark your face like we do with petty villains of your kind.

222
00:31:41,462 --> 00:31:44,963
事实上我是来盛水的
I actually came to fill my water bag.

223
00:31:52,982 --> 00:31:57,397
我叫乔恩，我是个健谈的…
Jons is the name. I'm a nice, talkative young man -

224
00:31:57,531 --> 00:32:02,955
思想端正，行为高尚的年轻人
- who only thinks good thoughts and commits honourable deeds.

225
00:32:08,883 --> 00:32:13,215
再见，姑娘… 我其实可以强迫你
Farewell, my girl... I could have raped you.

226
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:19,307
但是我希望我们之间能有爱情 虽然那在我心中已经干涸很久了
But between us, I'm tired of that kind of love. It's dry in the long run.

227
00:32:22,615 --> 00:32:28,289
特别是当我需要一个女管家时 你的厨艺好吗？
When I think of it I need a housekeeper. Do you cook well?

228
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:33,164
我结婚了，但是我希望 我老婆最好现在就死
I'm married, but I have hope my wife will be dead by now.

229
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:36,670
所以我需要一个女管家
So I need a housekeeper!

230
00:32:38,475 --> 00:32:43,685
别光站在那，过来 我救了你，你欠我的
Come now and don't just stand there. I saved you from death so you owe me!

231
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:03,130
真是差劲…
Bloody hams...

232
00:33:03,266 --> 00:33:06,185
简直像小丑
Making a spectacle of themselves.

233
00:34:24,235 --> 00:34:27,986
住手，你们这些蠢猪
Stop that, you tin-heads!

234
00:34:28,868 --> 00:34:32,619
我不演了！
I don't start so I'll go behind the drape.

235
00:34:33,876 --> 00:34:36,985
不演了，你们这些笨蛋！
Stop staring, you blockheads!

236
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,065
The horse sits in the tree and crows

237
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:51,579
The road is wide but the door is low The Black One dances on the beach

238
00:34:54,085 --> 00:34:59,839
The hen miaows in the darkest lake

239
00:35:04,387 --> 00:35:09,844
The day is red but the fish is dead

240
00:35:09,976 --> 00:35:14,306
The Black One squats on the beach

241
00:35:17,233 --> 00:35:20,816
The snake flutters in heaven's heights

242
00:35:23,823 --> 00:35:27,323
The virgin is pale but the pussy shows delight

243
00:35:27,452 --> 00:35:31,284
The Black One runs on the beach

244
00:35:33,917 --> 00:35:39,872
The ram hisses with teeth apart

245
00:35:45,136 --> 00:35:51,175
The gust is harsh and the waves dart

246
00:35:51,309 --> 00:35:56,055
The Black One farts on the beach

247
00:35:58,608 --> 00:36:02,357
The horse sits in the tree and crows

248
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:09,155
The road is wide but the door is low

249
00:36:09,286 --> 00:36:12,785
The Black One dances on the beach

250
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:21,040
The hen miaows in the darkest lake

251
00:36:25,969 --> 00:36:30,963
The day is red but the fish is dead

252
00:36:31,099 --> 00:36:35,642
The Black One squats on the beach

253
00:36:38,857 --> 00:36:42,226
The snake flutters in heaven's heights

254
00:36:45,322 --> 00:36:48,773
The virgin is pale but the pussy shows delight

255
00:36:48,908 --> 00:36:53,072
The Black One runs on the beach

256
00:36:54,998 --> 00:36:59,078
The sow lays and the cat sows

257
00:37:02,005 --> 00:37:05,919
Night is blighted and darkness glows

258
00:37:06,051 --> 00:37:09,135
The Black One remains, remains

259
00:37:09,262 --> 00:37:13,723
Remains, remains on the beach

260
00:39:34,213 --> 00:39:38,165
上帝让惩罚降临在我们身上
God has sent His punishment over us.

261
00:39:38,303 --> 00:39:43,051
是的！你们所有人都会消失…
Yes! You will all vanish...

262
00:39:43,186 --> 00:39:47,102
…陷入黑色的死亡
...by the Black Death.

263
00:39:47,234 --> 00:39:51,697
你们就像等待屠宰的牛群
You standing there like open-mouthed cattle.

264
00:39:51,825 --> 00:39:55,955
而你们却还满足于现状
And you sitting there in bloated self-satisfaction.

265
00:39:56,083 --> 00:40:00,712
你们知道这可能是 你们生命的最后一点时间吗？
Do you know that this could be your final hour?

266
00:40:03,094 --> 00:40:07,343
死神就在你们身后
Death stands behind you.

267
00:40:07,477 --> 00:40:11,347
我可以看到他头上的阴影 遮蔽了太阳
I can see the crown of his head gleam in the sun.

268
00:40:11,483 --> 00:40:15,697
当他在你们的身后举起亮闪闪的长镰时
His scythe flashes when he raises it behind your heads.

269
00:40:16,033 --> 00:40:19,035
你们之中谁会被他第一个选中？
Who among you will he strike first?

270
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:24,543
你们就像是替罪的羔羊
You there, staring like a goat...

271
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:31,046
在天黑之前是否已经死去？
Before evening will your mouth be distorted into a last, unfinished yawn?

272
00:40:32,101 --> 00:40:37,728
至于你，姑娘 青春亮丽，活力四射
And you, woman... Blooming with appetite and lust for life...

273
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,194
是否会在黎明前已经变得苍白无力？
Will you grow pale and drop before the dawn?

274
00:40:45,916 --> 00:40:51,839
而你这个长着大鼻子一脸傻笑的家伙…
And you there with your swollen nose and silly grin...

275
00:40:52,302 --> 00:40:58,095
你是不是还有一年的时间 用自己的尸体污染这土地？
Have you got a year left to pollute the earth with your debris?

276
00:40:58,228 --> 00:41:03,652
你们这些傻瓜知不知道 你们所有人都会死？
Do you know, you confirmed idiots, that you are all going to die?

277
00:41:03,779 --> 00:41:07,826
今天，明天，或者后天 你们所有人都有罪
Today, tomorrow, or the next day. You are all condemned.

278
00:41:07,953 --> 00:41:13,163
你们听到我的话了吗？听到了吗？ 有罪，有罪！
Do you hear what I say? Do you hear the word? Condemned, condemned!

279
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:19,088
主啊，怜悯我们这些下等人吧
Lord, take pity on us in our degradation.

280
00:41:19,222 --> 00:41:22,224
不要弃我们于不顾
Don't turn Your face from us in contempt -

281
00:41:22,477 --> 00:41:27,854
怜悯我们吧，怜悯你的子民，耶稣基督
- but have mercy on us for the sake of your Son, Jesus Christ!

282
00:42:31,635 --> 00:42:37,012
这有关厄运的演说真是血腥 这就是有思想的人维持生计的方式吗？
This bloody talk of doom. Is that sustenance for a modern man?

283
00:42:37,144 --> 00:42:42,521
他们真以为我们会认真对待吗？ 你在嘲笑我，先生
Do they really think we'll take them seriously? You laugh at me, Sire.

284
00:42:42,653 --> 00:42:50,238
我读过，听过，经历过很多的事情
I've read, heard and experienced most stories we tell one another.

285
00:42:50,375 --> 00:42:54,755
甚至是有关精灵，基督和圣灵的…
Even the ghost story of God, Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit -

286
00:42:54,882 --> 00:42:58,253
我已经麻木了
- I've absorbed without much emotion.

287
00:43:00,141 --> 00:43:04,355
- 你叫什么？ - 我是普洛，你是乔恩吗？
- Why are you shouting? - I'm Plog and you're Jons.

288
00:43:04,482 --> 00:43:07,520
- 可能吧 - 你见过我妻子吗？
- That's possible. - Have you seen my wife?

289
00:43:07,653 --> 00:43:13,742
不，没有，就算有 她如果像你，我也会很快忘记
No, I haven't. But if I had, and she resembled you, I'd be quick to forget.

290
00:43:15,876 --> 00:43:20,172
- 那么你没见过她？ - 大概她跑了吧
- So, you haven't seen her? - Maybe she's run away.

291
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,885
- 那你知道一些？
- 很多，但没有关于你妻子的
- Do you know anything? - Quite a lot, but not of your wife.

292
00:43:24,014 --> 00:43:27,930
去酒馆看看，或许能有收获
Go to the tavern and you may find an answer.

293
00:43:47,095 --> 00:43:52,852
那是真的，瘟疫蔓延整个西海岸 人们就像蚊虫一样死去
It's true, the plague has swamped the west coast. People die like flies.

294
00:43:52,979 --> 00:43:58,487
生意在这种时候还是不错 但是我的库存还没有脱手
Business is normally good at this time of year, but my stock's unsold.

295
00:43:59,073 --> 00:44:06,325
他们都在谈论末日 所有的预兆都很可怕
They talk of the Last Day. And all the omens certainly are terrible.

296
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:09,747
一个女人生出了一个牛头
A woman gave birth to a calf's head.

297
00:44:09,883 --> 00:44:14,179
人们都疯狂了，他们逃往内地 把瘟疫也带了过去
People are crazy. They flee inland and take the plague with them.

298
00:44:14,307 --> 00:44:20,349
如果真的是那样，我们 真该庆幸我们还能站着的日子
If it's as they say, then we'll have to enjoy life as long as we're standing.

299
00:44:20,484 --> 00:44:24,484
很多人都死了
Many people have cleaned themselves by fire and died.

300
00:44:24,616 --> 00:44:30,159
但是牧师说死了总好过活在地狱
But the priest says it is better to die clean than to live for hell.

301
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:35,881
这是末日，我们都知道 只是不敢这样说罢了
This is the end, that's what it is. We all know it, but no one dares to say it.

302
00:44:36,011 --> 00:44:39,881
这是末日，人们因为恐惧而疯狂
This is the end. People are crazy with fear.

303
00:44:40,017 --> 00:44:43,768
- 你也怕了吗？ - 你说的太对了，我怕！
- And you're scared too? - Too right I'm scared!

304
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:47,911
审判日的黄昏
Judgement Day edges toward evening.

305
00:44:48,045 --> 00:44:54,716
天使降临，坟墓敞开 那真是可怕的景象
The angels descend and the graves open. It will be terrible to see.

306
00:44:58,563 --> 00:45:02,397
- 这个手镯便宜卖你 - 我买不起
- I'll sell you this bracelet cheaply. - I can't afford it.

307
00:45:02,528 --> 00:45:06,943
- 这是纯银的
- 是很漂亮，但是恐怕太贵了
- It's genuine silver. - It's nice, but probably too expensive.

308
00:45:07,077 --> 00:45:11,706
- 你们看到过我妻子吗？ - 她失踪了吗？
- Have you gentlemen seen my wife? - Is she lost?

309
00:45:11,835 --> 00:45:15,621
他们说她和一个演员跑了
She's run away, they say. With an actor.

310
00:45:15,758 --> 00:45:19,211
一个演员？
如果她的品味这么差，就随她去好了
An actor? If she has such bad taste, let her go.

311
00:45:19,348 --> 00:45:24,476
你说的很对 我刚还想杀了她
You are absolutely right. I was thinking I would kill her.

312
00:45:24,606 --> 00:45:30,066
- 我知道，可杀人是另一回事了 - 我还要杀了那个演员
- I see. Murder is another thing. - I'm going to kill the actor, too.

313
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:33,700
- 演员？ - 那个把她拐跑的家伙
- The actor? - The one she's run off with.

314
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:37,877
- 为什么？ - 你有毛病吗？
- What for? - Are you thick?

315
00:45:38,004 --> 00:45:43,214
哦，那个演员！我知道 他们现在应该已经走很远了
Oh, the actor! Now I understand. There are far too many of them.

316
00:45:43,346 --> 00:45:47,642
就算他没错，你也要杀他？
Even if he's blameless, you should kill him.

317
00:45:48,146 --> 00:45:53,773
- 你在给他讲故事吗？ - 我？讲故事？
- Are you telling tales to him? - Me? Am I telling tales?

318
00:45:58,288 --> 00:46:03,582
你也是演员，说不定你和他同谋
You're also an actor and it's your cronie that's snuck off with his wife.

319
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:07,044
你也是演员吗？
Are you an actor as well?

320
00:46:07,178 --> 00:46:10,631
我，演员？不是
Me, an actor? Not really.

321
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:13,937
那我们会杀了你
Then we should kill you. It's logical.

322
00:46:15,275 --> 00:46:19,061
- 你很有意思 - 你死定了
- You're funny. - You've gone pale.

323
00:46:19,198 --> 00:46:25,454
- 你不会觉得良心不安吗？ - 你很有意思，不是吗？
- Something on your conscience? - You're funny. Don't you think so?

324
00:46:26,669 --> 00:46:32,426
或许我们该在你的脸上 做个坏人的记号
Maybe we should mark you as one does with petty villains of your kind.

325
00:46:33,263 --> 00:46:37,345
你对我妻子干了什么？
What have you done to my wife?

326
00:46:49,666 --> 00:46:53,536
你想杀了我吗？为什么？
Do you want to hurt me? Why?

327
00:46:53,672 --> 00:47:00,177
我在这里碍事吗？ 我最好还是走，不会再来了
Have I annoyed anyone or been in the way? I'll leave and never come back.

328
00:47:00,308 --> 00:47:03,726
站起来，让所有人都能听到你
Stand up so everyone can hear you.

329
00:47:06,652 --> 00:47:09,773
大声点…
Speak louder...

330
00:47:09,908 --> 00:47:15,118
倒立，让我们看看你是不是好演员
Stand on your head so we can see whether you're a good actor.

331
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:28,553
你对我妻子做了什么？
What have you done to my wife?

332
00:47:30,484 --> 00:47:34,354
- 别想跑，起来跳舞 - 我不，我不
- Don't whimper. Get up and dance. - I can't. I won't.

333
00:47:34,491 --> 00:47:37,446
- 学狗熊的样子 - 我不会模仿
- Imitate a bear. - I can't imitate a bear.

334
00:47:37,579 --> 00:47:40,831
让我们看看
We'll see if you can anyway.

335
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:43,561
- 起来，当头好熊 - 我不会演熊
- Get up. Be a good bear. - I can't be a bear anymore.

336
00:49:01,178 --> 00:49:04,596
记着下次我们再见到你 会狠狠的收拾你
Remember what I'd do to you if we met again?

337
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:09,856
我是个守信用的人
I'm a man of my word.

338
00:49:33,189 --> 00:49:36,441
- 他叫什么？ - 米克尔
- What's his name? - Mikael.

339
00:49:36,862 --> 00:49:40,280
- 他多大？ - 刚满一岁
- How old is he? - He's just over one year.

340
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:46,794
- 他看起来比实际年龄大些 - 你这么想吗？他是挺大的
- He's big for his age. - You think so? Yes, he is quite big.

341
00:49:47,088 --> 00:49:52,049
- 你今天表演了 - 你认为那很糟糕吗？
- You were in a performance today. - Did you think it was bad?

342
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:56,928
你没化妆看起来更漂亮 这件衣服很适合你
You're more beautiful without make-up. That dress suits you better.

343
00:49:57,063 --> 00:50:03,069
你这么想吗？乔纳森离开了 所以现在我们的情况真是糟
You think so? Jonas Skat went and left us, so now we're in a real fix.

344
00:50:03,198 --> 00:50:07,280
- 他是你丈夫吗？ - 乔纳森？不是
- Is that your husband? - Jonas? No.

345
00:50:07,413 --> 00:50:11,627
- 我丈夫叫约瑟夫 - 哦，他
- The other man is. His name is Jof. - Oh, him.

346
00:50:11,754 --> 00:50:17,262
现在只有我和他 我们还得演出，真是无聊
Now it's only me and him. We'll have to do tricks again, and that's a bother.

347
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:22,184
- 你也演出吗？ - 哦，是的，而且约瑟夫很会变戏法
- Do you do tricks as well? - Oh, yes. And Jof is a good juggler.

348
00:50:22,313 --> 00:50:26,313
- 米克尔将来还会是个杂耍演员吗？ - 约瑟夫这样希望
- Will Mikael also be an acrobat? - Jof wants him to be.

349
00:50:26,445 --> 00:50:29,650
- 但是你不想？ - 我不知道
- But not you? - I don't know.

350
00:50:29,784 --> 00:50:33,914
- 或许他会是个骑士 - 那可不太好玩，要我说的话
- Maybe he'll be a knight. - It's not so much fun, I can tell you.

351
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:37,127
- 你看来不高兴 - 没有
- You don't look happy. - No.

352
00:50:37,255 --> 00:50:42,597
- 你很累吗？为什么？
- 我已经厌倦了我的同伴
- Are you tired? Why? - I have boring company.

353
00:50:42,723 --> 00:50:45,975
- 你是说你的随从？ - 不，不是他
- Do you mean your squire? - No, not him.

354
00:50:46,103 --> 00:50:50,150
- 那你说的是谁？ - 我自己
- Who do you mean, then? - Myself.

355
00:50:50,277 --> 00:50:53,980
- 哦，我知道了 - 你真的知道吗?
- Oh, I understand. - Do you really?

356
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:57,072
是的，我非常理解
Yes, I understand quite well.

357
00:50:57,205 --> 00:51:02,451
我常常想为什么人们总是折磨自己
I often wonder why people torment themselves as soon as they can.

358
00:51:03,007 --> 00:51:08,135
- 米亚… - 约瑟夫…约瑟夫，怎么了？
- Mia... - Jof... Jof, what is it?

359
00:51:09,017 --> 00:51:15,225
约瑟夫！约瑟夫！你怎么了？ 你…快点坐下吧
Jof! Jof, what have you done? Have you...? Come and sit down.

360
00:51:15,361 --> 00:51:19,112
你去哪了？让我看看
Where have you been? Let me look at you.

361
00:51:24,877 --> 00:51:30,634
为什么你非去酒馆不可？ 你喝醉了
Why did you have to go to the tavern? You drank, of course.

362
00:51:30,761 --> 00:51:36,304
- 我没有喝多 - 你老是说什么天使魔鬼之类的
- I didn't drink a drop. - You boasted about angels and devils.

363
00:51:36,438 --> 00:51:41,399
- 人们不喜欢太多的想法 - 我没有提起天使啊
- People don't like too many ideas. - I didn't mention angels.

364
00:51:41,529 --> 00:51:45,825
那么你唱歌跳舞了 你总是表演
Then you sang and danced. You always have to perform.

365
00:51:45,954 --> 00:51:50,001
- 然后他们就生气了 - 你看…
- People get angry at that, too. - Look at what...

366
00:51:50,127 --> 00:51:54,542
看看…看看我给你带什么来了？
Look at what... at what I bought for you.

367
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:02,934
- 你买不起的 - 反正我弄到了
- You couldn't afford that. - Well, I did it anyway.

368
00:52:03,066 --> 00:52:05,605
约瑟夫！
Jof!

369
00:52:05,737 --> 00:52:11,031
- 哦，他们出手真重 - 为什么你不回手？
- Oh, they gave me such a beating. - Why didn't you give one back?

370
00:52:11,162 --> 00:52:15,494
我只会害怕和生气 但不会很久
I just got scared and angry, but never got that far.

371
00:52:15,628 --> 00:52:20,340
我生气了，相信我 我像狮子一样咆哮…
I got angry, believe me. I roared like a lion...

372
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:24,684
- 他们害怕了？ - 没有，他们都在笑
- Did they get scared? - No, they just laughed.

373
00:52:28,942 --> 00:52:32,479
米克尔…米克尔
Mikael... Mikael.

374
00:52:40,461 --> 00:52:43,333
- 他身上的味道很好闻 - 而且他很结实
- Smell how good he smells. - And he's solid.

375
00:52:43,467 --> 00:52:47,087
你是个棒小伙 绝对是个杂耍演员的料
You're a solid one, you are. A real acrobat's body.

376
00:52:48,433 --> 00:52:52,184
这是我丈夫，约瑟夫
This is my husband, Jof.

377
00:52:53,817 --> 00:52:56,392
- 你好 - 你好
- Good day. - Good day.

378
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:59,948
你有个很可爱的儿子 他带给你们很多乐趣
You have a fine son. He will bring you joy.

379
00:53:00,078 --> 00:53:04,826
是的，他很可爱 我们有些什么可招待的，米亚？
Yes, he is lovely. Do we have anything to offer, Mia?

380
00:53:04,961 --> 00:53:08,581
- 谢谢，不需要了 - 我摘了些野草莓
- Thanks, I shan't have anything. - I picked wild strawberries.

381
00:53:08,717 --> 00:53:13,013
- 而且还挤了些牛奶 - 有牛奶…
- And we actually milked some milk. - Have milked...

382
00:53:13,141 --> 00:53:16,975
如果骑士大人能和我们 一同进餐那真是荣幸万分
If the knight would join us it would be an honour.

383
00:53:17,106 --> 00:53:21,188
- 请坐吧，我去拿吃的 - 请…
- Sit down and I'll bring the food. - Please...

384
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:25,692
- 您要去哪？ - 去EIsinore
- Where are you heading? - To Elsinore.

385
00:53:25,871 --> 00:53:29,871
- 我劝你最好别去 - 为什么呢？
- I'd advise against a trip like that. - Why, if I may ask?

386
00:53:30,003 --> 00:53:35,000
瘟疫已经从海岸蔓延过来 上万人因此死掉了
The plague is going down the coast. People are dying in their ten thousands.

387
00:53:35,136 --> 00:53:40,929
- 祸不单行啊 - 跟着我穿过树林
- Trouble always brings his brother. - Follow me through the woods.

388
00:53:41,063 --> 00:53:45,609
你可以呆在我这或者去东海岸 那样就安全了
You can stay at my estate or follow the east coast. You'll be safer.

389
00:53:46,155 --> 00:53:49,442
这些是木草莓，长在山上
They're wood strawberries. They grow on the hill.

390
00:53:49,577 --> 00:53:53,957
我从没见过这么大的 闻上去真香
I never seen them so big. Smell how fragrant they are.

391
00:53:55,671 --> 00:54:00,051
- 请用吧 - 非常感谢
- Enjoy the fare. - I thank you respectfully.

392
00:54:00,345 --> 00:54:04,131
我想你的建议很好，但我还要考虑一下
I think your suggestion is good, but I must consider first.

393
00:54:04,269 --> 00:54:07,307
能有同伴一起穿过树林应该很好
It would be nice to have company through the wood.

394
00:54:07,441 --> 00:54:11,821
我听说那里充斥着幽灵，魔鬼和小偷
It's full of ghosts, devils and thieves. So I heard.

395
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:15,449
我想那是不错，不过我必须考虑
I said it wasn't bad, but I must consider it.

396
00:54:15,579 --> 00:54:19,116
斯卡离开后，我就是剧团的负责人
Since Skat left, I'm responsible for the troupe.

397
00:54:19,252 --> 00:54:27,169
- 我是老板了 - 我是老板
- I've become the manager, after all. - "I've become the manager, after all."

398
00:54:30,521 --> 00:54:34,022
- 你喜欢草莓吗？ - 他救了我的命
- Would you like strawberries? - That man saved my life.

399
00:54:34,152 --> 00:54:39,909
- 坐下和我们一起吧 - 约瑟夫骑士很慷慨
- Sit down and join us. - The knight's Jons conveys his thanks.

400
00:54:41,664 --> 00:54:44,916
- 哦，这可真好 - 只是短暂的
- Oh, it's so nice. - For a short while.

401
00:54:45,045 --> 00:54:49,710
总是这样，每天都很相似
Almost always. One day is much like the next.

402
00:54:49,845 --> 00:54:54,177
没什么奇怪的 夏天总是好过冬天
Not so strange. Summer is better than winter -

403
00:54:54,311 --> 00:54:59,106
因为你不会受冻 但是春天是最好的
- because you don't freeze. But spring is the very best.

404
00:54:59,236 --> 00:55:02,737
我写了一首有关春天的诗 我去取我的鲁特琴
I wrote a poem about spring. I'll fetch my lute.

405
00:55:02,867 --> 00:55:07,081
别这样，约瑟夫，也许我们 的客人不喜欢你的诗
Not now, Jof. Our guests might not be entertained by your verses.

406
00:55:07,207 --> 00:55:10,328
- 拜托，我自己写歌 - 你说的对
- Please. I write songs myself. - There you are.

407
00:55:10,463 --> 00:55:15,044
我有首有关一条不贞节的鱼的歌 你们一定没有听过
I have one about an unchaste fish you may not have heard.

408
00:55:15,179 --> 00:55:18,051
你们也听不到
You won't hear it, either.

409
00:55:18,184 --> 00:55:23,063
很多人不理解我的艺术 我也不想折磨任何人
Some people don't appreciate my art and I don't wish to torment anyone.

410
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:31,738
- 烦恼总是这么多 - 当你结婚后会好很多
- One worries so much. - It's better when you are a couple.

411
00:55:31,874 --> 00:55:34,627
- 你有爱过谁吗？ - 是的…
- Don't you have anyone? - Yes...

412
00:55:34,753 --> 00:55:37,958
- 她现在在干什么？ - 我不知道
- What is she doing now? - I don't know.

413
00:55:38,092 --> 00:55:41,795
你看起来很严肃 她是你的甜心吗？
You look so solemn. Was she your sweetheart?

414
00:55:41,932 --> 00:55:47,226
我们是新婚，在一起玩，一起笑
We were newlyweds, played together, laughed quite a lot.

415
00:55:47,358 --> 00:55:53,863
我写歌赞美她的眼睛，鼻子 和美丽的耳朵
I wrote songs to her eyes, her nose, her exquisite, small ears.

416
00:55:53,994 --> 00:55:59,371
我们去打猎，晚上跳舞 生活得非常充实
We went on hunts. In the evening we danced, the house was full of life.

417
00:55:59,503 --> 00:56:03,206
你还要些草莓吗？
Would you like some strawberries?

418
00:56:03,343 --> 00:56:06,429
信仰是沉重的负担，你知道吗？
Faith is a heavy burden, do you know that?

419
00:56:06,557 --> 00:56:12,765
就像一个躲在黑暗中的爱人 无论你怎样呼唤，都不会出现
It's like loving someone in the dark who never comes, no matter how you call.

420
00:56:14,779 --> 00:56:20,821
但是当我坐在这
和你和你丈夫一起时 所有这些都变得虚幻了
But all of that seems unreal when I sit here with you and your husband.

421
00:56:20,956 --> 00:56:24,659
它突然变得无关紧要
It's suddenly insignificant.

422
00:56:24,796 --> 00:56:28,843
你现在看起来不那么严肃了
Now you don't look so solemn.

423
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:34,720
我会记住这一刻，这祥和的黄昏…
I will remember this moment. The stillness and the dusk...

424
00:56:34,854 --> 00:56:38,474
还有野草莓和牛奶
The bowl of wild strawberries, of milk...

425
00:56:39,946 --> 00:56:43,317
你在暮色中的脸庞…
Your faces in the evening light...

426
00:56:43,452 --> 00:56:48,580
米克尔在安睡，约瑟夫弹着鲁特琴
Mikael lying asleep, Jof with his lute.

427
00:56:48,711 --> 00:56:52,378
我会竭力记住我们说的每句话
I will try and remember what we spoke of.

428
00:56:52,759 --> 00:56:56,510
我会小心地珍藏这段记忆
And I will carry this memory between my hands...

429
00:56:56,641 --> 00:57:01,935
就像捧着满满一碗牛奶一般小心
...as carefully as if it were a bowl brimming with freshly milked milk.

430
00:57:07,367 --> 00:57:13,658
这会是我生命中闪光的一刻…
And this will be a sign for me... and greatly fulfilling.

431
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:51,347
我一直在等
I have been waiting.

432
00:57:51,482 --> 00:57:54,900
对不起，我有事耽误了
Excuse me, I was somewhat delayed.

433
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:58,650
我已经调整了战术
As I've given away my strategy, I will retreat.

434
00:57:58,786 --> 00:58:02,406
随便，该你走了
Go ahead. It's your move.

435
00:58:02,584 --> 00:58:06,370
- 为什么你看起来这么开心 - 那是我的秘密
- Why do you look so pleased? - That's my secret.

436
00:58:06,508 --> 00:58:10,888
事实上，我要吃掉你的骑士了
Naturally. I will take your knight now.

437
00:58:11,015 --> 00:58:14,635
当然
You were right to.

438
00:58:14,771 --> 00:58:19,270
- 你在骗我？ - 当然，你掉进了陷阱
- Have you tricked me? - Of course, you fell into the trap.

439
00:58:19,404 --> 00:58:22,656
我控制了局势
I put you in check.

440
00:58:22,785 --> 00:58:27,913
- 你在笑什么？
- 没什么，想办法保你的国王吧
- What are you laughing at? - No matter. Save your king instead.

441
00:58:28,044 --> 00:58:33,587
- 你太骄傲了 - 我们的游戏很有趣
- You are quite arrogant. - Our game amuses me.

442
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,888
该你走了，快点，我赶时间
It's your move. Be quick, I'm in a hurry.

443
00:58:37,017 --> 00:58:43,059
我知道你忙，但是你逃不了比赛
I know you are busy, but you won't avoid our game. It will take its time.

444
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:47,105
你会和小丑一起穿越树林？
You're travelling with the jesters through the woods?

445
00:58:47,243 --> 00:58:51,195
那个叫约瑟夫和米亚的… 还有一个小孩？
The two called Jof and Mia... who have a little son?

446
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,417
你为什么问这个？
Why do you ask?

447
00:58:58,553 --> 00:59:01,176
没什么…
No reason...

448
00:59:09,697 --> 00:59:14,741
- 你看到乔恩了吗？我们该走了 - 我想他在旅馆
- Have you seen Jons? We must go. - I believe he's in the inn.

449
00:59:18,253 --> 00:59:22,549
天哪，这不是铁匠吗？
Good heavens. If it isn't Plog the blacksmith.

450
00:59:22,677 --> 00:59:25,596
- 晚上好 - 你自己一个人在哭？
- Evening. - Are you snivelling all alone?

451
00:59:25,724 --> 00:59:31,267
是啊，就像一只无助的小兔子
Yes, the blacksmith's sobbing and wailing like a soaked rabbit.

452
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,237
- 还是因为老婆？ - 是的，我找不到她
- Still the wife? - Yes, I haven't found her.

453
00:59:34,363 --> 00:59:37,615
是啊，有女人是地狱没有她们还是地狱
Yes, it's hell with women and hell without them.

454
00:59:37,744 --> 00:59:41,079
最好就是趁最好的时候杀掉她们
Logical to kill them when it's at its best.

455
00:59:41,208 --> 00:59:45,457
- 洗洗涮涮 - 大哭的孩子和湿盘子
- Henpecking and swills. - Screaming babies and wet nappies.

456
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:50,551
- 尖尖的指甲和怨毒的叫骂 - 丈母娘就像魔鬼的姑母
- Sharp nails and malice. - The Devil's aunt as mother-in-law.

457
00:59:50,682 --> 00:59:55,181
- 什么时候才能入睡… - 另一个世界…
- Then when you're going to sleep... - Another tune...

458
00:59:55,315 --> 00:59:59,018
眼泪，诉苦，和满肚子的牢骚
Tears, complaints and laments by the sackfull.

459
00:59:59,155 --> 01:00:02,692
- 为什么你不吻我？ - 为什么你不唱歌？
- "Why don't you kiss me?" - "Why don't you sing?"

460
01:00:02,827 --> 01:00:07,575
- 为什么你不再像以前那样爱我？ - 为什么你不看看我的新衣服
- "Why don't you love me like before?" - "Why don't you eye my new shift?"

461
01:00:07,711 --> 01:00:11,378
- 你只会转过身去打呼噜 - 哦，见鬼…
- "You just turn your back and snore." - Oh, hell...

462
01:00:11,509 --> 01:00:16,672
哦，见鬼…她走了！高兴点！
Oh, hell... She's gone now! Be happy!

463
01:00:18,687 --> 01:00:22,058
我要用我的火钳夹住他们的鼻子
I'm going to pinch them in the nose with my pliers.

464
01:00:22,193 --> 01:00:26,145
我要用我的锤子砸碎他们的胸膛
I'm going to pound them on the chest with the little hammer.

465
01:00:26,283 --> 01:00:31,707
我要砸烂他们的脑袋
I'm going to crack them lightly on the head with the sledgehammer.

466
01:00:31,834 --> 01:00:35,750
看看，他振作起来了！
Look, he's blubbering again!

467
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:39,717
- 或许我爱她 - 或许你爱她？
- Maybe I love her. - Maybe you love her?

468
01:00:39,848 --> 01:00:44,144
听着，你这笨蛋 爱只是性欲的另一种说法
Listen, you moron, love is another word for lust -

469
01:00:44,272 --> 01:00:50,111
只是欲望加上无休止的谎言和欺骗
- plus lust, plus lust, plus a lot of deception, falsehoods and trickery.

470
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:56,246
- 但是真的很伤人 - 爱是最可怕的瘟疫
- But it hurts anyway. - Love is the blackest of all plagues.

471
01:00:56,375 --> 01:01:00,707
如果沉溺其中或许会有欢乐 但是稍纵即逝
If you died from it there'd be some joy. But it almost always passes.

472
01:01:00,841 --> 01:01:05,553
- 不，我的还没有消失 - 哦，你的也消失了
- No, mine won't pass. - Oh, yes, yours too!

473
01:01:05,683 --> 01:01:10,264
只有少数几个傻瓜才会为爱而死
There are only a few poor dullards now and then who die of love.

474
01:01:10,399 --> 01:01:15,313
如果在这个不完美的世界上 所有的东西都是不完美的
If all is imperfect in this imperfect world, then love is most imperfect -

475
01:01:15,449 --> 01:01:19,496
那么爱就是最不完美的
- in it's perfect imperfection.

476
01:01:19,623 --> 01:01:25,879
你真幸运――能相信这些废话
You're lucky to have such a fluid tongue that you believe your own twaddle.

477
01:01:26,008 --> 01:01:29,842
相信？谁说的 我只不过喜欢给出好建议
Believe? Who said I did? But I love giving good advice.

478
01:01:29,973 --> 01:01:34,436
要求一个却得到两个 我是个好学的青年
Ask for one and you get two. So I'm actually a learned chap.

479
01:01:34,564 --> 01:01:38,398
乔恩，我能和你一起穿过树林吗？
Jons! Can I follow you through the woods?

480
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:44,487
我太孤独了，也不想回家听他们嘲笑我
I'm so Ionely and don't want to go home as they all laugh at me.

481
01:01:44,665 --> 01:01:48,581
除非你别再哭了，否则我们不会带你
As long as you don't sob all the time or we'll leave you.

482
01:01:48,713 --> 01:01:51,502
乔恩
Jons!

483
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:04,317
- 我的小兄弟… - 小心，乔恩！
- My little brother... - Watch out, Jons!

484
01:02:04,448 --> 01:02:07,735
- 他只想打架 - 他在哭
- He just wants to fight. - He's sobbing now.

485
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:13,828
我如果伤到你，我很抱歉 但是我就是这个脾气
I'm really sorry if I harmed you, but I have such a temper.

486
01:02:13,964 --> 01:02:16,836
抓住我的手
Take my hand.

487
01:02:19,223 --> 01:02:23,223
- 让我拥抱你吧，小兄弟 - 等等吧
- Let me embrace you, little brother. - A little later, maybe.

488
01:02:23,354 --> 01:02:27,650
我们真的很忙，谢谢
We're actually in a hurry. Thanks.

489
01:03:17,612 --> 01:03:23,986
啊，我看到了谁？ 谁在森林的边缘若隐若现…
Ah, what do I see? Who is it looms out of the edge of the forest -

490
01:03:24,123 --> 01:03:28,039
如果不是我最爱的演员还会是谁！
- if not My Most Treasured with attached actor!

491
01:03:50,209 --> 01:03:51,752
小心！
Watch out!

492
01:03:51,879 --> 01:03:58,550
你肯定就是那个伤害 我的Kunigunda的脏铁匠
You must be the dirty blacksmith that humiliated my beloved Kunigunda.

493
01:03:58,890 --> 01:04:04,647
- 你叫她什么？ - Kunigunda，你聋了吗？
- What did you say her name was? - Kunigunda. Are you deaf?

494
01:04:04,775 --> 01:04:08,941
她叫莉萨，笨莉萨 小偷莉萨，或者妓女莉萨
Her names's Lisa. Lisa Daft or Sloven or Tart.

495
01:04:09,074 --> 01:04:13,489
- 轻佻的莉萨 - 哦上帝，他真粗鲁
- Drawerless Hussy or Arse Lisa. - Goodness, he's base!

496
01:04:13,532 --> 01:04:18,874
总好过色情，不像你 你这个贱女人
Just good at sleaze, not unlike yourself, you gilded bawd-pudding.

497
01:04:19,083 --> 01:04:22,370
- 天哪，他太过分了
- 你这个恶心丑陋的臭杂种
- Oh, he's base! - You awful, cropped bastard...

498
01:04:22,505 --> 01:04:26,375
如果我是你
...of seven mangey mongrels, if I were in your infested rags -

499
01:04:26,512 --> 01:04:29,930
我就会因为羞愧去撞墙
- I'd be afflicted by such boundless shame -

500
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:34,689
我会因为自己生的 如此恶心而自甘堕落
- that I'd free nature from my embarrassing countenance.

501
01:04:34,943 --> 01:04:40,237
- 小心点，你这个… - 娘娘腔
- Watch out, you perfumed... - Powder-puff.

502
01:04:40,369 --> 01:04:44,665
娘娘腔… 我会让你死得很难看
Powder-puff... that I don't let off a fart -

503
01:04:44,793 --> 01:04:48,745
送你去杂耍人的地狱
- that will assign you to the juggler's inferno in a flash -

504
01:04:49,759 --> 01:04:53,426
- 在那你们可以坐在一起… - 自言自语…
- where you can sit together and... - Read soliloquies...

505
01:04:53,557 --> 01:04:58,899
自言自语直到魔鬼耳朵都长茧子
Read soliloquies to one another until dust forms in the Devil's ears.

506
01:04:59,150 --> 01:05:03,862
小心点，我会捅破你的肠胃 让它们从你的耳朵流出来
Careful I don't poke your belly so your intestines flow out your ears.

507
01:05:04,951 --> 01:05:12,002
我会痛扁你，让你再不能表演 那些乱七八糟的东西
Careful I don't smack you so you can't even play for Turks and cannibals.

508
01:05:12,130 --> 01:05:15,216
你在笑什么？这很严肃
What are you lauging at? This is serious.

509
01:05:15,344 --> 01:05:19,724
在南方有一种长的很像人的动物叫猿
In southern lands there is a man-like animal called an ape.

510
01:05:19,851 --> 01:05:22,889
- 那又怎么了？ - 只是…
- What of it? - Just that...

511
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:27,605
- 普洛戈，我的普洛戈 - 什么？
- Plog, my only Plog. - What?

512
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:31,610
- 什么？ - 亲爱的普洛戈，原谅我吧
- What? - Darling Plog, forgive me everything.

513
01:05:31,746 --> 01:05:37,336
- 她会在一分钟内开始哭
- 我不得不哭，这简直太可怕了
- She'll start crying in a minute. - I have to cry. It's awful.

514
01:05:37,464 --> 01:05:41,416
那个男人欺骗了我，你不会相信的
That man deceived me so badly, you won't believe.

515
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:47,888
- Kunigunda，如果真相大白的话… - 现在好戏上演了
- Kunigunda, if the truth will out... - And now for his favourite dishes.

516
01:05:48,024 --> 01:05:51,940
普洛戈，我们回家后我给你做饭…
Plog, when we get home I'll make dumplings for you -

517
01:05:52,072 --> 01:05:56,820
做你最爱吃的甘蓝团子
- with mashed turnips and lingonberries which is your favourite.

518
01:05:56,955 --> 01:06:02,415
- 不是吗，普洛戈？
- 是，但是我必须先杀了他
- Isn't that so, Plog? - Yes, but I have to kill him first.

519
01:06:02,548 --> 01:06:06,299
对，杀了他，他真该死
Yes, kill him. Kill him really properly.

520
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:12,019
- 我一点都不喜欢他
- 上帝啊，为什么你要创造女人
- I don't like him at all anymore. - God, why did you give us woman?

521
01:06:12,147 --> 01:06:15,684
你知道他吗？假胡子和假牙
You know what he is? Just a false beard, false teeth -

522
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:19,606
假笑和预演好的台词，一个绣花枕头
- false smiles, rehearsed intonation and empty as a jar.

523
01:06:19,743 --> 01:06:22,069
- 杀了他 - 我亲爱的普洛戈
- Go ahead and kill him. - My dear Plog...

524
01:06:24,627 --> 01:06:28,793
如果你以为那就是所谓的我
那你就错了
If you thought I'd defend my so-called reality you're mistaken.

525
01:06:28,925 --> 01:06:33,590
- 杀了我吧，我谢谢你 - 你在说什么？
- Kill me. I'll thank you... afterwards. - What are you saying?

526
01:06:34,143 --> 01:06:37,763
他开始混乱了，已经胜利了一半
He's created confusion. Already a half victory.

527
01:06:37,899 --> 01:06:42,979
- 做点什么，别光站在那 - 我恐怕杀不了他
- Do something, don't just stand there! - He has to fight or I can't kill him.

528
01:06:43,116 --> 01:06:46,487
他必须激怒我才行
He has to provoke me so I get angry like before.

529
01:06:46,830 --> 01:06:51,376
亲爱的朋友，我要把这匕首刺进胸膛
Dear friend, I lower this dagger to my breast.

530
01:06:51,505 --> 01:06:56,051
那样我的形象就会完全改观
And my reality will quickly transform into a new, solid reality.

531
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:59,466
我的尸体会说明一切
The absolute manifestation of the corpse.

532
01:06:59,602 --> 01:07:02,937
等等…我不是那个意思
Wait... I didn't mean it like that.

533
01:07:03,066 --> 01:07:08,859
我原谅你，Kunigunda，再会了 我的朋友们，时常想想我吧
I forgive you, Kunigunda. Farewell, my friend, pray for me sometime.

534
01:07:25,479 --> 01:07:28,565
哦，天哪…
Oh, dear... Oh, dear...

535
01:07:28,692 --> 01:07:32,395
我真的不是那个意思 我已经开始喜欢他了
I didn't mean it like that. I started to really like him.

536
01:07:32,532 --> 01:07:37,576
他绝对死了，我从没见过这样的死法
He's absolutely dead. I've almost never seen such a dead actor.

537
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,463
真是伤心啊 尽管他只是一点小小的要求
It's really sad, although he wanted it himself, poor thing.

538
01:07:42,591 --> 01:07:48,300
- 而我却和她结婚…
- 可是你的小莉萨回来了
- And I'm married to her... - Well, you got your little Lisa back.

539
01:07:48,934 --> 01:07:54,062
- 你不开心吗？ - 乔恩，准确的说…
- Aren't you happy? - Jons, in the strictest confidence...

540
01:07:54,193 --> 01:08:00,235
- 生命是不是太…
- 是的，不过别想它了
- Isn't life quite... - Yes, it is. But don't think about it.

541
01:08:01,497 --> 01:08:05,544
真是疯狂，那就是为什么
It's mad, that's what it is.

542
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:17,767
表演精彩极了 我如果不是演员就什么也不是了
That was a good performance. I'm nothing if not a good actor.

543
01:08:20,738 --> 01:08:24,785
我会找棵树爬上去
I'll find a tree and climb it.

544
01:08:24,911 --> 01:08:28,958
那样就没有熊，狼 或者幽灵能抓到我了
So no bears, wolves or ghosts can get hold of me.

545
01:08:48,910 --> 01:08:54,999
我明天要去找约瑟夫和米亚 我们一起去All Saints节
I'll find Jof and Mia tomorrow, then we'll go to the All Saints Festival.

546
01:08:56,214 --> 01:09:02,172
我会为自己唱首歌
I'll sing a song to myself. "I'm a little bird who sings how I want"

547
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:07,981
森林里的工匠…真好啊
Craftsmen in the forest... How nice.

548
01:09:14,328 --> 01:09:17,533
天哪，这是我的树 你居然锯它！
By God, it's my tree they're sawing down!

549
01:09:17,666 --> 01:09:21,796
嘿，你这个混蛋！ 你干嘛锯我的树？
Hey, you dozy cockerel! What are you doing to my tree?

550
01:09:22,216 --> 01:09:26,512
你不会回答吗？
礼貌真是不值钱，你是谁？
Can't you answer? Courtesy is cheap. Who are you?

551
01:09:27,934 --> 01:09:31,637
我锯倒树的时候，你的大限就到了
I'm sawing down your tree as your time is up.

552
01:09:31,773 --> 01:09:36,770
- 这不可能，我没时间 - 你没时间吗？
- It's not possible. I don't have time. - Haven't you got time?

553
01:09:37,366 --> 01:09:42,956
- 我要去演出
- 因为死亡，它已经被取消了
- I've got a performance. - It's cancelled. Because of a death.

554
01:09:43,084 --> 01:09:45,873
- 我的合同！ - 取消了
- My contract! - Annulled.

555
01:09:47,299 --> 01:09:52,296
- 我的家人和孩子…
- 斯卡特，你该感到羞愧
- My family and my children... - Shame on you, Skat!

556
01:09:52,558 --> 01:09:56,095
我是很羞愧，羞愧…
I am ashamed, I'm ashamed...

557
01:09:56,231 --> 01:10:01,311
没有什么特赦之类的？ 一些有关演员的特别规定？
Aren't there any acquittals? Any special rules for actors?

558
01:10:01,448 --> 01:10:04,320
不，没有
No, not in this case.

559
01:10:05,121 --> 01:10:08,373
没有漏洞，没有例外
No loopholes, no exceptions...

560
01:10:53,243 --> 01:10:57,243
月亮从云后升起来了
The moon just came out from behind the clouds.

561
01:10:57,375 --> 01:11:00,662
很好，我们可以更清楚地看路了
Good. We'll see the road better.

562
01:11:01,006 --> 01:11:05,635
- 我不喜欢今晚的月亮 - 森林太安静了
- I don't like the moon tonight. - The trees are so still.

563
01:11:05,931 --> 01:11:12,733
- 那是因为没有风 - 他是说它太寂静了
- That's because there isn't any wind. - He means they are very still.

564
01:11:13,277 --> 01:11:15,769
完全的寂静
It's completely quiet.

565
01:11:16,783 --> 01:11:20,154
- 起码我们能听到狐狸的声音 - 或者是猫头鹰
- If we at least heard a fox. - Or an owl.

566
01:11:20,372 --> 01:11:25,618
或者除了我们之外的人的声音
Or a human voice. Beside one's own...

567
01:11:53,803 --> 01:11:56,805
- 你去哪？ - 找个树桩
- Where are you going? - To the stake.

568
01:11:56,933 --> 01:12:01,562
我知道，是那个巫婆 为什么要在午夜烧死她？
I see, it's the witch. Why burn her in the middle of the night?

569
01:12:01,691 --> 01:12:06,570
- 人们现在都很缺少娱乐 - 安静点
-People lack amusement nowadays. - Quiet, by all the dev... saints.

570
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:11,780
- 她身体里有魔鬼
- 那你们可是八个勇敢的小伙子
- She has the Devil with her. - Then you men are eight brave men.

571
01:12:11,917 --> 01:12:17,591
我们有酬劳，是自愿干这个的
Well, we're paid. The task was voluntary.

572
01:13:54,589 --> 01:13:58,174
你听得到吗?
Do you hear me?

573
01:13:58,303 --> 01:14:02,968
- 他们说你为魔鬼工作 - 你为什么问这个？
- They say you worked with the Devil. - Why do you ask that?

574
01:14:03,103 --> 01:14:08,397
不是好奇，是很私人的原因
Not out of curiosity, but for highly personal reasons.

575
01:14:08,529 --> 01:14:12,778
- 我也想见见他 - 为什么？
- I also want to meet him. - Why?

576
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:17,035
我想问问他有关上帝的事
I want to ask him about God.

577
01:14:17,168 --> 01:14:21,084
他一定知道的，如果他是魔鬼
He must know. He if anyone.

578
01:14:22,302 --> 01:14:26,634
- 只要你想你就能见到 - 怎么样做？
- You can see him when you want. - How?

579
01:14:26,768 --> 01:14:29,854
那你就必须照我的话做
But then you must do as I say.

580
01:14:31,692 --> 01:14:35,145
看着我的眼睛
Look into my eyes.

581
01:14:36,576 --> 01:14:40,623
你看到了什么？你看到他了吗？
Well? What do you see? Do you see him?

582
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:45,914
我看到你眼睛里有一点点恐惧
I see a rigid fear in your eyes.

583
01:14:46,467 --> 01:14:49,719
别的没什么了
Nothing else.

584
01:14:49,848 --> 01:14:53,978
没有人，什么都没有…
No one, nothing... no one...

585
01:14:54,981 --> 01:14:56,773
不…
No...

586
01:14:58,237 --> 01:15:02,569
他不也站在你的身后吗？
Isn't he standing behind your back either?

587
01:15:03,663 --> 01:15:07,366
不，那什么也没有
No. There's nothing here.

588
01:15:10,674 --> 01:15:16,882
但他总是伴随着我 我只需要伸出手就能感觉到他
But he's with me everywhere. I only need to put out my hand and I feel his.

589
01:15:17,018 --> 01:15:21,350
他现在还和我一起，火伤害不了我
He with me now as well. The fire won't hurt me.

590
01:15:21,484 --> 01:15:24,522
- 他这么说的吗？ - 我知道
- Has he said so? - I know.

591
01:15:24,656 --> 01:15:29,819
我知道，你肯定会在某处看到他
I know, I know. You must see him somewhere, you must!

592
01:15:29,957 --> 01:15:33,827
牧师也可以看到他，这些人也可以
The priest had no trouble seeing him, nor the troops.

593
01:15:33,963 --> 01:15:38,177
他们很怕他，他们甚至不敢碰我
They're so scared of him they don't even dare to touch me.

594
01:15:43,229 --> 01:15:46,231
- 为什么你们夹她的手？ - 不是我们干的
- Why have you crushed her hands? - It's not us.

595
01:15:46,359 --> 01:15:50,110
- 谁？ - 问那边的僧侣吧
- Who? - Ask the monk over there.

596
01:15:51,994 --> 01:15:55,661
你对那女孩做了什么？
What have you done to the girl?

597
01:15:59,256 --> 01:16:02,674
你总是不停地发问吗？
Do you never cease asking?

598
01:16:02,803 --> 01:16:06,885
是的…从不停止
No... I never cease.

599
01:16:07,186 --> 01:16:09,595
但是你得不到回答
But you don't get any answer.

600
01:16:27,011 --> 01:16:32,221
我想过杀了守卫 但是没用的，她快死了
I thought about killing the guard, but it doesn't help. She's almost dead.

601
01:16:32,353 --> 01:16:35,938
我告诉你小心点！别离她太近
I told you to watch out! Don't go near to her.

602
01:16:46,543 --> 01:16:50,543
吃了这个，痛苦就会消失了
Eat this and the pain will go.

603
01:17:50,167 --> 01:17:54,630
- 她看到了什么？你知道吗？ - 她不会再有痛苦了
- What's she see? Can you answer? - She's not in pain anymore.

604
01:17:54,758 --> 01:17:59,173
你没有回答我的问题 谁来照顾那些孩子？
You're not answering my question. Who will take care of that child?

605
01:17:59,308 --> 01:18:04,056
是天使，上帝，撒旦
还是什么人都没有？
Is it the angels or God or Satan or just emptiness?

606
01:18:04,191 --> 01:18:07,644
- 没有人，先生… - 不能这样！
- Emptiness, Sire... - It can't be so!

607
01:18:07,780 --> 01:18:12,741
看看她的眼睛
她可怜地意识到一些东西
Look at her eyes. Her poor consciousness is perceiving something.

608
01:18:13,081 --> 01:18:16,748
- 月下的虚无 - 不…
- Emptiness under the moon. - No...

609
01:18:16,879 --> 01:18:21,378
我们只能无能为力的站在这里 看着她看到的一切
We stand powerless with hanging arms, as we see what she sees.

610
01:18:21,511 --> 01:18:24,549
我们和她有着同样的恐惧
Our fear and hers are the same.

611
01:18:24,683 --> 01:18:29,182
那小孩…我受不了了…受不了了
That little child... I can't be bothered, I can't be bothered...

612
01:19:44,359 --> 01:19:49,270
He sings so beautifully of Jesus Christ

613
01:19:49,406 --> 01:19:54,780
There is great joy in heaven

614
01:19:56,170 --> 01:20:02,342
黎明就要来了 尽管有那见鬼的火刑架
The dawn will break soon. Yet the heat hangs like a damp blanket.

615
01:20:02,472 --> 01:20:05,391
我好怕
I'm so scared.

616
01:20:05,519 --> 01:20:10,480
我们知道有些事会降临
但不知道是什么
We feel something is going to happen to us, but we don't know what it is.

617
01:20:10,986 --> 01:20:14,571
- 或许是末日 - 末日
- Maybe the final day. - The final day.

618
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:28,466
你有水吗？能给我些吗？
Haven't you got any water? Can you give me some water?

619
01:20:31,229 --> 01:20:35,229
- 我染上了瘟疫
- 就在树桩那边别过来！
- I've got the plague. - Keep to the other side of the stump!

620
01:20:41,371 --> 01:20:46,998
我害怕死亡，我不想死，不想死！
I'm scared of dying. I don't want to die, I don't want to!

621
01:20:52,306 --> 01:20:57,350
你们不能可怜可怜我？帮帮我…
Can't you take pity on me? Help me...

622
01:20:57,481 --> 01:21:01,101
至少和我说话！
At least talk to me!

623
01:21:05,787 --> 01:21:10,582
没用的，没用的
It doesn't help. It doesn't help.

624
01:21:10,711 --> 01:21:13,749
我知道那没用
I know it doesn't help at all.

625
01:21:16,930 --> 01:21:20,764
我要死了，我…我…
I'm going to die. I... I...

626
01:21:24,651 --> 01:21:30,325
我将会怎么样？
你们就不能安慰我一下？
What's going to happen to me? Can't you even comfort me?

627
01:21:30,453 --> 01:21:36,162
你们没有一点怜悯之心吗？
你们难道看不到我…
Haven't you got any mercy? Can't you see that I...

628
01:21:36,296 --> 01:21:39,963
没人帮我吗？我不能有点水吗？
Is there no help? Can't I have any water?

629
01:21:41,012 --> 01:21:45,891
毫无意义，那毫无意义
It's meaningless. It's completely meaningless.

630
01:21:46,021 --> 01:21:49,189
我说了那毫无意义
I said it's meaningless.

631
01:21:49,318 --> 01:21:52,404
- 救救我！ - 你听不到我说什么吗？
- Help me! - Can't you hear I'm comforting you?

632
01:22:19,869 --> 01:22:24,913
- 我们能结束游戏吗？ - 该你走
- Shall we conclude our game? - It's your move.

633
01:22:32,974 --> 01:22:36,974
- 我吃了你的皇后 - 我看不到
- I took your queen. - I didn't see that.

634
01:22:50,504 --> 01:22:56,343
米亚…我看到一些可怕的事 一些无法形容的事
Mia... I see something terrible, something almost unspeakable.

635
01:22:56,472 --> 01:23:00,223
- 你看到了什么？ - 那个骑士在下棋
- What do you see? - The knight is playing chess.

636
01:23:00,353 --> 01:23:04,649
- 我也看到啦，没什么可怕的 - 你看到他在和谁下吗？
- I see that too. It's not so terrible. - You see who he's playing with?

637
01:23:04,778 --> 01:23:10,405
- 他自己，别这样吓唬我 - 不，不，他不是一个人
-He's alone. Don't scare me like that. - No, no. He's not alone.

638
01:23:10,537 --> 01:23:16,294
- 那是谁？ - 死神，他在和死神下棋
- Who is it? - Death. He's playing Death himself.

639
01:23:16,422 --> 01:23:20,718
- 别那么说 - 我们必须逃走了
- Don't say that. - We must try and get away.

640
01:23:20,846 --> 01:23:22,886
- 我们不能 - 必须走
- We can't. - We must try.

641
01:23:23,016 --> 01:23:28,524
他们正全神贯注的下棋 如果我们悄悄走开，他们不会知道的
They're so engrossed in their game, if we leave quietly they won't notice.

642
01:23:33,158 --> 01:23:36,244
该你走了
It's you move, Antonius Block.

643
01:23:40,003 --> 01:23:43,171
你对我们的游戏失去兴趣了？
Have you lost interest in our game?

644
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:47,549
失去兴趣？恰恰相反…
Lost interest? On the contrary...

645
01:23:48,184 --> 01:23:52,100
你看来很焦虑 你隐瞒了什么吗？
You look anxious. Are you concealing something?

646
01:23:53,735 --> 01:23:58,981
- 什么东西都逃不过你的眼睛，是吗？ - 没有
- Nothing escapes you. Not so? - Nothing escapes me.

647
01:23:59,119 --> 01:24:04,579
- 没人能逃得过我
- 是的，我很焦虑
- No one escapes me. - It is true I'm anxious.

648
01:24:06,005 --> 01:24:09,091
你害怕了
You are scared.

649
01:24:16,064 --> 01:24:20,610
我忘了这些棋子都放在哪了
I forget where the pieces were.

650
01:24:20,738 --> 01:24:24,156
但是我还没有忘
But I haven't forgotten.

651
01:24:24,286 --> 01:24:28,202
你别想轻易跑掉
You won't get away that easily.

652
01:24:35,972 --> 01:24:39,473
- 我看到些有趣的东西 - 你看到了什么？
- I see something interesting now. - What do you see?

653
01:24:40,939 --> 01:24:44,476
你在下一手里会被将死
You will be checkmate in the next move.

654
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:50,570
是的…
That's true...

655
01:24:50,705 --> 01:24:54,919
- 在你多活的这些日子里有什么收获吗？ - 是的，有收获
- Did you profit from your respite? - Yes, I did.

656
01:24:55,755 --> 01:25:01,713
那很好，我现在就走
That pleases me. I will leave you now.

657
01:25:01,849 --> 01:25:07,891
当我们再见的时候 你和你周围的一切都结束了
When we meet again you and your entourage's time will be over.

658
01:25:10,112 --> 01:25:14,991
- 那你会讲出你的秘密吗？ - 我没有秘密
- And you'll reveal your secrets? - I carry no secrets.

659
01:25:15,705 --> 01:25:19,325
那么说，你什么也不知道？
So you know nothing?

660
01:25:19,461 --> 01:25:22,713
我是无知的
I am unknowing.

661
01:25:44,211 --> 01:25:49,838
- 你看到那奇怪的光了吗？ - 那是随着黎明而来的风暴
- Do you see that strange light? - It's the storm coming with the dawn.

662
01:25:49,971 --> 01:25:54,267
是别的东西，很可怕的 你听到隆隆声了吗?
It's something else, something terrible. You hear the rumbling?

663
01:25:54,395 --> 01:25:59,024
- 很可能是雨 - 不，不是雨
- It's probably the rain. - No, it's not the rain.

664
01:25:59,153 --> 01:26:03,616
他看到我们了，跟着我们 他追上我们了
He's seen us, followed us, he's caught up to us, he's coming at us!

665
01:26:17,434 --> 01:26:20,971
进马车里去，米亚 我们进去，快点
Get in the wagon, Mia. Let's get in, quickly!

666
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:30,156
死亡精灵要通过这里 米亚，死亡精灵
It's the angel of death passing by, Mia. The angel of death.

667
01:26:30,288 --> 01:26:34,204
- 而且他非常大 - 你觉得冷吗？
- And he's very big... - Do you feel how cold it is?

668
01:28:37,978 --> 01:28:42,857
我听回来的十字军战士说 你们在回来的路上
I heard from returning crusaders that you were on your way home.

669
01:28:42,986 --> 01:28:47,200
我一直在等你 其他人都逃走了，躲避瘟疫
I've waited for you. All the others have fled the plague.

670
01:28:54,088 --> 01:28:58,040
你不认识我了吗？
Don't you recognize me anymore?

671
01:29:01,225 --> 01:29:05,307
你也变了
You've also changed.

672
01:29:10,992 --> 01:29:14,778
现在我看着你
Now I can see it's you.

673
01:29:14,915 --> 01:29:17,917
你的眼睛…
Somewhere in your eyes...

674
01:29:18,796 --> 01:29:24,672
你的脸，还隐藏着恐惧
Somewhere in your face, but hidden and frightened...

675
01:29:25,641 --> 01:29:29,771
就像许多年前出征的男孩一样
...is that boy that set off all those years ago.

676
01:29:31,693 --> 01:29:36,073
那已经结束了，我有点累了
It's over now and I'm a little tired.

677
01:29:36,910 --> 01:29:41,159
- 你很后悔回来？ - 不
- Do you regret your journey? - No.

678
01:29:41,292 --> 01:29:47,085
我没有后悔，只是有点累了
I don't regret anything. But I'm a little tired.

679
01:29:50,725 --> 01:29:54,012
我能看出来…
I can see...

680
01:30:00,825 --> 01:30:03,911
我的朋友在这
My friends are there.

681
01:30:06,293 --> 01:30:10,708
叫他们进来，我会架桌子准备早餐
Ask them to come in. I'll set the table for breakfast.

My wife, Lisa. Curtsey for the honourable Sire, Lisa.

707
01:33:09,558 --> 01:33:14,057

She's a little difficult at times and we've had a little affray -

708
01:33:14,191 --> 01:33:17,776
但是比大多数人好
- but no worse than most people.

In our darkness we call out to you Lord. Oh God, have mercy on us.

710
01:33:24,917 --> 01:33:28,252
因为我们渺小，懦弱和无知
For we are small, afraid and without knowledge.

711

跳着庄严的舞步，走向黑暗的国度
- in a solemn dance, away to the dark country.

729

雨水洗净他们的脸庞
Whilst the rain washes over their faces -

730
01:36:13,825 --> 01:36:18,324
冲去他们脸上的泪水
- cleans their cheeks of tears of salt.

731
01:36:21,797 --> 01:36:25,879
你和你白日梦啊…
You and your dreams and visions...
