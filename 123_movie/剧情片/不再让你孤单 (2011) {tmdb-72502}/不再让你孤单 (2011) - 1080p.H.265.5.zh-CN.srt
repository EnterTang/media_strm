1
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,540
Ruby, have a drink with me.

2
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,900
Spare my assistant. I'll drink with you.

3
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,900
Pour.

4
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,670
- Finish this. - Finish this...

5
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,710
What about the apartment?

6
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,710
I'll buy it. No problem.

7
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,020
Nobody, nobody but you.

8
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,590
Andrew, where are you?

9
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,750
Why didn't you tell me you're not coming?

10
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,670
Now I have to do this all alone.

11
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,590
They brought devilish alcohol because of you.

12
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,030
My stomach is about to bleed.

13
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,150
Is this a set up?

14
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,340
What are you babbling about?

15
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,660
Your wife?

16
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,590
I can't hear...

17
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,200
Even the shoes suck when you're out of luck

18
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,870
381

19
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,150
Hold it...

20
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,750
Tonight someone has to strip.

21
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,940
Quiet down...

22
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,910
Today, we're all gathered here,

23
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,630
because the handsome and charming Zhu Tian

24
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,750
from our precinct

25
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,670
will kiss his bachelor days goodbye.

26
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,750
He found himself a wife.

27
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,070
Dong, you're too fussy. Just cut the spiel.

28
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,230
I want to sing this song.

29
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,710
Dong, get with the times. This song is out.

30
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,230
This is the wrong key.

31
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,380
This version is different.

32
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,150
You two go ahead. I can't sing this song.

33
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,740
Good, I'm sober.

34
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,350
You didn't have to do this.

35
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,990
What did you say?

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,670
You think women can only climb onto a bed?

37
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,230
Not me. I'll make a name for myself.

38
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,670
You go go go

39
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,950
Keep an eye on that moron.

40
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,510
N-A-E-L-C.

41
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,820
Miss.

42
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,750
Why is there a seedling here?

43
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,870
Miss.

44
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,740
Miss.

45
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,710
Are you drunk, Miss?

46
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,220
You're a little lamb in a men's world.

47
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,790
What room are you in? I'll take you back.

48
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,920
Take me back. Why am I left here?

49
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,430
What's this doing in my hand?

50
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,510
Police.

51
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,790
Don't get any ideas.

52
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,830
A cop? Great, you better take me back.

53
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,430
What room are you in?

54
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,030
I don't know, they ditched me.

55
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,790
Take me home, officer.

56
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,110
Miss...

57
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,150
You smell good.

58
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,870
What room are you in?

59
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,790
381

60
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,030
381

61
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,870
Where have you been?

62
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,110
Mr Ko. No. I just order some snacks for you guys

63
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,790
seems you are so hungry.

64
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,420
I am not hungry, just thirsty.

65
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,110
Let's play a game. If I win,

66
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,910
you must buy a flat from me.

67
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,830
No problem. I'll buy.

68
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,510
Let's play a game.

69
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,390
Let's go back inside.

70
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,950
- Come on. - OK.

71
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,430
Look at all those holes on your vest.

72
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,230
Inside and out, they're the living proof

73
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,830
of your bachelorhood.

74
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,870
We're all married,

75
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,020
you should be next.

76
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,070
I have to go.

77
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,910
Come on, not when we're all here.

78
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,510
Stay. It's hard setting up this gathering.

79
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,030
No, I need to catch the last train.

80
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,390
I can't spend more than I should.

81
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,110
You're great,

82
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,070
saving each penny for your bro.

83
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,350
Ping, Dong is a lifesaver.

84
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,110
He needs to look after Zhencong. Let him go.

85
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,510
Well...

86
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,910
Don't drink and drive.

87
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,830
- All right. Have a safe ride home. - Have fun.

88
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,630
Xiaole, don't be late next morning.

89
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,550
I know.

90
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,070
Bye.

91
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,390
Bye

92
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,860
Miss.

93
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,030
Why didn't you catch me, you stupid?

94
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,070
Are you OK?

95
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,870
It hurts.

96
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,420
Come on.

97
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,070
Miss.

98
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,150
Are you OK?

99
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,500
Little lamb.

100
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,550
Are you drunk?

101
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,190
Miss.

102
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,030
Take me home.

103
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,190
I must go home, Miss.

104
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:11,910
I want you to carry me home.

105
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,670
I must go home, Miss.

106
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,070
I have to go home myself.

107
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,910
I have to go home too.

108
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,630
Where do you live?

109
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,590
I live...

110
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,910
Where's your friend?

111
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,910
My friend?

112
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,910
You're right...where is he?

113
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,390
Last year, I was alone in Beijing,

114
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,950
I was almost frozen...

115
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,310
under a big clock.

116
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,990
I sang

117
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,990
"Happy Birthday" to myself.

118
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,910
"Happy Birthday" to myself...

119
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,270
It's snowing.

120
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,340
No, it's not. You're drunk.

121
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,630
It is really snowing.

122
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,630
Look.

123
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,990
Where's the switch?

124
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,230
Welcome home.

125
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,030
Take it easy.

126
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,990
I'll put your purse over here.

127
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,190
It's dangerous to drink like this.

128
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,150
A girl shouldn't drink like this.

129
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,500
You smell good.

130
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,110
Ouch.

131
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,340
Ouch.

132
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,550
I don't want to be alone.

133
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,070
Don't go back to your wife.

134
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,670
Stay here with me.

135
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,430
"Alcohol is bad. I paid $27 for the cab."

136
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,260
You're Lion King, You're just as professional...

137
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,790
as Yao Ming.

138
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,190
Stop playing, you'll wake the neighbors. Don't be late for work.

139
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,430
I want one.

140
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,750
OK...Lion King needs to break for lunch.

141
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,230
Come on.

142
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,190
Go home...It's lunchtime.

143
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,350
Come, let's eat.

144
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,430
I ate already.

145
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,910
You did? With whom?

146
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:24,950
Stay here.

147
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,550
I can't. There's a car in front.

148
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,190
If it doesn't move, I can't.

149
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,910
Miss, is this your car?

150
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,710
Move it, you're holding up traffic.

151
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,990
Where else am I supposed to park?

152
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,820
What are you looking at?

153
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,390
Put this in the car.

154
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,870
Remember me at the karaoke the other night?

155
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,270
I know you.

156
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,550
You bit me.

157
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,270
Alcohol is bad. I paid $27 for the cab.

158
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,190
You remember the fare, but what about me?

159
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,310
What's your name? I remember you.

160
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,630
Fang Zhendong.

161
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,750
Show some respect and move the car.

162
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,230
People are getting impatient.

163
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,280
All right, I respect you. Take this.

164
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,500
I'll buy you coffee some day.

165
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,350
Li Peiru.

166
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,590
Fang Zhendong.

167
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,510
A toast to Guiping's prosperous business.

168
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,710
Thanks, Zhong.

169
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,590
Good business.

170
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,780
Thanks.

171
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,910
What is it? You hurt yourself?

172
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,700
Nothing, just a bit numb.

173
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,390
Drink up, it's good for your circulation.

174
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,660
What's your hurry back to Tianjin? Your wife?

175
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,310
Do I look pussy whipped to you?

176
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,630
Both my in-laws are not in good health.

177
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,390
I need to be back sooner to look after them.

178
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,670
Anyway, I've already sold my flat...

179
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,910
in Beijing.

180
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,750
That's a good idea.

181
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,070
In a few more years, I'll sell mine too

182
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,350
and take Zhencong to an outlying village.

183
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,030
I have an old house in Mentougou,

184
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,910
remember we went there last year?

185
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,390
I think it's quite suitable for Zhencong.

186
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,350
Let me know if you need it.

187
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,350
Enough about your bro. What about yourself?

188
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,430
There's a better solution.

189
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,060
Get a wife. She'll take care of you both.

190
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,020
Grandma said I was a lifesaver.

191
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,540
It's my job to look after my kid brother.

192
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,910
Drink up.

193
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,710
The truth of the matter is...

194
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,310
you're not only...

195
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,350
your brother's savior.

196
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,430
Girls are waiting to be rescued by you.

197
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,550
Fang Zhendong. What a coincidence.

198
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,590
It's you?

199
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,340
You're alone?

200
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,820
Where's your wife?

201
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,070
I don't have one. That's why I'm alone.

202
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,790
A nice, independent man.

203
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,510
What did you buy?

204
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,030
Ingredients to make dumplings.

205
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,150
Dumplings?

206
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,940
What's your phone number?

207
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,190
13552881838

208
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,180
81838

209
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,110
13552881838

210
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,390
OK.

211
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,750
All these are for dumplings?

212
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,750
Yes.

213
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,550
I'm in a hurry. Let me borrow them.

214
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,510
No way.

215
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,630
I beg you. Please.

216
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,060
You know how to make them?

217
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,870
That's why I asked for your number.

218
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,430
Wait for my call. I'll buy you coffee next time.

219
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,510
Fang Zhendong.

220
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,510
Relax, I won't take advantage of you.

221
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,150
It's OK as long as you'll pay me back.

222
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,500
Fang Zhendong.

223
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,830
Hello, Miss Li.

224
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,820
How do you know it's me?

225
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,550
Only you call me Fang Zhendong.

226
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,590
What are you doing right now?

227
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,710
Making dumplings.

228
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,910
Perfect. Can you send them over?

229
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,190
Why should I?

230
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,150
Because you're a cop, you're here to serve.

231
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,190
You must save me.

232
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,030
Cops don't save anyone with dumplings.

233
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,710
You're not an ordinary cop.

234
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,070
I'm here all by my lonesome,

235
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,510
you must come over and save me.

236
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,260
You want me to save you?

237
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,550
Please? Fang Zhendong.

238
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,990
Alright...don't cry.

239
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,600
Hurry, Fang Zhendong. Come on in.

240
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,580
Look.

241
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,060
You're from Hong Kong? You're very capable.

242
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,070
I'm not very capable. I'm simply brilliant.

243
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,630
Right...brilliant.

244
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,500
You summoned me here to watch

245
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,630
how you brilliantly ravage the dumplings?

246
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,070
Show me...

247
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,670
how to make genuine local dumplings.

248
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,590
Your wrapping...

249
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,740
shouldn't be too thick.

250
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,030
You must not put too much stuffing.

251
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,750
You're amazing, Fang Zhendong.

252
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,550
You're a true lifesaver.

253
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,580
Smell that?

254
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:58,630
No. I made coffee for you.

255
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,790
Thanks. I thought you were talking about me.

256
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,870
Do you cook?

257
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,190
No.

258
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,150
You cook for your girlfriend?

259
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,220
No. You're making...

260
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,230
your boyfriend dumplings?

261
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,270
No, you are.

262
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,870
Me? Why don't you eat out?

263
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,350
I must do something special.

264
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,710
A girl from Hong Kong

265
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,270
makes Beijing dumplings for her boyfriend.

266
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,630
That's so romantic.

267
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,790
If I do it, it will be me romancing him.

268
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,670
No, do you understand?

269
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,310
All Hong Kong cooking shows are like this:

270
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,830
"I made this because we're pressed for time."

271
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,830
Everyone wants ready-made, not the process.

272
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,150
That's because he's married.

273
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,990
You told me when you were drunk.

274
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,630
I was drunk?

275
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,830
I'm a cop, I have a still trap.

276
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,630
Thank you.

277
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,230
He's early.

278
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,150
Put this on.

279
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,790
Andrew.

280
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,670
Thanks. Is the john fixed?

281
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,910
Yes.

282
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:42,710
Thank you.

283
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,790
It's all right.

284
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,740
I made you dumplings.

285
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,990
I can do better than that.

286
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,230
I remember the 1 994...

287
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,910
World Cup final.

288
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,030
BraZil Vs...

289
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,030
Italy.

290
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,030
In the U.S.A.

291
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,350
Brazil Vs Italy.

292
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,430
I remember my ex just left me,

293
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,830
and you made me watch the World Cup with you.

294
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,110
Dong, get your facts straight.

295
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,190
She left because you watched the World Cup

296
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,870
or you watched it...

297
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,830
because she left you?

298
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,750
Fang Zhendong. Where are you?

299
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,750
Our worry is uncalled for.

300
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,150
All right.

301
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,110
Miss Li. Are you all right?

302
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,750
No lights?

303
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,870
You blew a fuse? No air-con?

304
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,790
- No power. - This is supposed to be a 5-star home.

305
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,190
You're drunk again?

306
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,180
There's nothing to drink but alcohol.

307
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,790
You can't do this.

308
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,780
Get the manager to fix it.

309
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,790
Miss Li,

310
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,750
you should call your boyfriend.

311
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,350
My boyfriend?

312
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,510
Yes.

313
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:29,350
He doesn't want me. He's with his wife.

314
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,110
Miss Li.

315
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,340
Miss Li.

316
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,910
Miss Li.

317
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,950
Lie down.

318
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,950
Cover up.

319
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,190
You have anything thicker?

320
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,500
Little lamb.

321
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,310
- Miss Li. - Why are you so nice to me?

322
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,820
Why did you come over when I called?

323
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,350
I'm not a little lamb, Miss Li.

324
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,510
Little lamb.

325
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,870
Miss Li.

326
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,350
You always come over

327
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,550
I'm not a little lamb, Miss Li.

328
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,110
when I call.

329
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,310
Miss Li, I'm Fang Zhendong.

330
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,190
Miss Li.

331
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,230
Let me see your heart.

332
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:17,230
Miss Li.

333
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,390
Why even you don't want me?

334
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,190
I'm all alone.

335
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,910
Hold me.

336
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,030
I'm cold.

337
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,910
I'm tired.

338
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,660
Are you all right?

339
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,940
Did I invite you over?

340
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,020
Of course.

341
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,070
We're going to have a baby then.

342
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,590
We slept...

343
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,950
in the same bed.

344
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,110
Get up.

345
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,990
What is your make-up doing in the freezer?

346
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,110
For women,

347
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,180
this is more important than water.

348
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,070
Miss Li, I must go home.

349
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,990
I must make breakfast for my kid brother.

350
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,190
That's so sweet.

351
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,980
What do you mean by little lamb?

352
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,180
What little lamb?

353
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,150
You call me that when you're drunk.

354
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,660
That's gibberish.

355
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,390
Want me to make you breakfast?

356
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:50,990
Yes.

357
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,380
Your ginger tea.

358
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,590
Eat.

359
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,310
Breakfast is ready.

360
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,070
Your brother is an artist.

361
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,220
I'm sorry. I must go look for my brother.

362
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,270
What?

363
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,020
Zhencong.

364
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,670
Zhencong.

365
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,230
Zhencong.

366
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,150
You're not working today. Why are you here?

367
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,750
Is everything all right?

368
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,070
He's your kid brother?

369
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,070
- Have you eaten? - How cute.

370
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,070
Hello.

371
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,310
So cute.

372
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,110
Are you cold?

373
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,030
I'm fine.

374
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,430
I'll help you.

375
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,630
Good.

376
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,430
Zhencong, let's go home.

377
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,870
Let's go.

378
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,700
Yours?

379
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,830
So you're actually a handsome man.

380
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,590
Hot dumplings.

381
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,190
Come here.

382
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,750
Let's eat.

383
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,710
Try it.

384
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,190
Slowly...it's hot.

385
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,260
Put this on.

386
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,310
So many awards.

387
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,190
I work hard because I can't do anything else.

388
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,230
Serving the people.

389
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:36,670
You have a nice home.

390
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,790
You call this nice?

391
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,340
My ex...

392
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,910
took everything when she left,

393
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,790
including the wedding picture on the wall.

394
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,270
You have a 5-star home. I have no star.

395
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,270
Your ex?

396
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,230
When did you get married?

397
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,190
1 999,

398
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,910
not for very long. She left 9 years ago.

399
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,230
I hope you'll sleep well.

400
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,030
How long have you been seeing her?

401
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,270
Dating.

402
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,670
3 years, in 1 996.

403
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,630
Few men remember things like that.

404
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,310
We both like A-Mei then.

405
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,380
She was a hit.

406
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,630
My ex sang "Crushed by the One I Love."

407
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,430
She said I clapped the loudest.

408
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,580
Then I sang Chen Xing's "Don't be Lonely."

409
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,310
She said she was moved when I sang it to her.

410
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,710
Moved? I'll have to hear this.

411
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,510
It's your smell.

412
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,590
No way. I always put it out...

413
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,350
in the sun.

414
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,540
Here.

415
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,580
Nobody ever says it smells.

416
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,390
Right?

417
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,430
Get some sleep.

418
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,430
Good night.

419
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,380
Your call cannot be connected.

420
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:24,870
Hello.

421
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,550
How are you, nice to meet you.

422
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,500
Turn left at the next intersection,

423
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,940
turn right at the next light...

424
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,790
- and go straight. - Thanks.

425
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,140
- Don't mention it. - Thanks.

426
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,030
Are you all right?

427
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:49,950
I'm fine.

428
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,830
Chief, you haven't submitted your reports.

429
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,150
What reports?

430
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,580
The daily reports.

431
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,030
No way. I hand them in on time every day.

432
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,150
But they didn't receive it.

433
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,590
Who told you?

434
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,630
We come here at 4:30 every day.

435
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,670
I turn it in at 5:30. It cannot be.

436
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,790
But you haven't turned it in for 3 days.

437
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,750
Fang Zhendong.

438
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,740
Get in, Zhencong.

439
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,670
Aren't you tired of wearing that?

440
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,830
I'm only tired of not wearing them.

441
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,910
Can you do me a favor?

442
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,070
Like what?

443
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,310
Follow my boyfriend.

444
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:38,910
No.

445
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,750
He put all my money on a flat.

446
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,750
I can't afford a private investigator.

447
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,790
I can't abuse my power, understand?

448
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,900
You're supposed to serve the people.

449
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,710
I can't mix business with pleasure.

450
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,670
Please?

451
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,780
Forget it.

452
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,310
What do you want to know?

453
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,350
I want to know if there's another woman.

454
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,630
His wife is a woman.

455
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,750
She's his past.

456
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,630
Other women will be his future.

457
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,060
Even if I'll find out he has another woman,

458
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,110
I can only tell you "No," understand?

459
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,990
It's all right, I'm fine.

460
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,710
You're bleeding.

461
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,700
It's all right.

462
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,950
Wait a minute.

463
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,710
- It's all right. - I'm sorry.

464
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,300
Let's go.

465
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,030
Dong.

466
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,710
Xiaowan.

467
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,980
Having a good time?

468
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,790
Zhencong.

469
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,430
I made soup.

470
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,270
Xiaowan.

471
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,070
Spare me that guy's things. I'm no trash can.

472
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,070
You're so petty.

473
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,270
I better go then.

474
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,550
It's all right.

475
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,190
Chief, did you hand it in?

476
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,550
Mind your business. I'm serious.

477
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,790
Fang Zhendong.

478
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,110
What is it?

479
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,030
One piece of luggage.

480
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,790
Ruby.

481
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,030
What are you doing, Peiru? Are you craZy?

482
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,270
Peiru.

483
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:05,950
Watch it.

484
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,110
Forget it, Andrew.

485
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,580
I want my money back.

486
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,230
What money?

487
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,830
My commission from selling each flat.

488
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,950
I already gave you $20K...

489
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,790
for your credit cards.

490
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,190
My commission is over $1 00K.

491
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,990
Says who?

492
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,510
Ruby did most of the work.

493
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,870
You're from Hong Kong. You can't be serious?

494
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,390
Get up.

495
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,310
How can you say that?

496
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,230
I'm fine. I can still manage...

497
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,150
without men or money.

498
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,230
What?

499
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,310
Why did you move back?

500
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,190
The creep took my 5-star home.

501
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,070
I was at your office.

502
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,950
I was fired.

503
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,110
Why?

504
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,550
It happens. Layoffs after the new year.

505
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,950
When the stock market falls, people split up.

506
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,710
I consulted a fortune teller.

507
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:24,630
He told me to put these here for good luck.

508
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,990
Get me the salt.

509
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,950
Inside this cupboard?

510
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:31,990
Yes.

511
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:43,950
Pour it in.

512
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,990
All of it.

513
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:01,150
Put this on the east west side.

514
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,310
I'll have luck and health.

515
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,030
Why are you here?

516
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,070
I made dumplings.

517
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,070
Nuke them...

518
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,990
if you're hungry.

519
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,030
I have to go.

520
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,110
Throw these out for me.

521
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,150
You don't want this?

522
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,230
Earth to earth, dust to dust.

523
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,310
It's all right. You can call me.

524
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,270
Tear this down, my work station over here.

525
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,110
The pantry over here.

526
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:32,380
Coffee, red wine, mixer...

527
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,070
Over here,

528
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,750
Heaven and Earth Real Estate Co.

529
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,230
How much is the rent?

530
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,190
Around $280K in total.

531
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,390
That's almost $300K.

532
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,630
Just $280K.

533
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,630
I already got a discount.

534
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,590
$300K is a lot.

535
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,110
You should re-consider.

536
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,430
- What do you mean? - Nothing.

537
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,230
- You don't think I can do this? - I don't mean that.

538
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,230
I came to Beijing by myself.

539
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,510
I won't be here

540
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,710
if I'm scared.

541
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,190
I'll get a loan from the bank.

542
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:11,870
Miss Li.

543
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,300
If you had...

544
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,310
told me about Andrew earlier,

545
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,540
I could have made Ruby leave him.

546
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,390
None of this would have happened.

547
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,190
Miss Li.

548
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,390
I don't blame you, OK?

549
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,430
I know what I have to do.

550
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,590
"Final notice."

551
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,830
I'm glad you're here.

552
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,310
I don't know how to deal with Xiaowan's Mom.

553
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,190
Dong.

554
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,750
Zhencong, the green onions...

555
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,790
Here they are.

556
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:27,790
Here.

557
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,230
Go.

558
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:47,630
I'm here because of this, Mr Fang.

559
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,190
"Mom, Zhencong wants me to marry him."

560
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,870
We're poor and my daughter is a mute,

561
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,660
but...

562
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,390
I won't marry her off casually.

563
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,190
I must make sure she's happy.

564
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,230
I know,

565
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,790
my brother has communication issues.

566
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,310
He can't even take care of himself,

567
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,310
Iet alone take care of someone else.

568
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,260
He has no business getting married.

569
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,910
But please believe me.

570
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:29,350
As his brother, I'll look after them both.

571
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,300
Please re-consider.

572
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,190
- You're mistaken, Mr Fang. - No.

573
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,190
I know...

574
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,190
you don't want Xiaowan to suffer.

575
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,230
No.

576
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,230
Look.

577
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,710
I trust he will be good to her. Look.

578
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,350
Look at the details...she looks so pretty.

579
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,070
Xiaowan knows...

580
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,790
Zhencong will make her happy.

581
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,830
She says she's not mute...

582
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,910
in Zhencong's world.

583
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,870
She's unique.

584
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,350
Chicken.

585
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,590
- Xiaowan, Zhencong usually... - Dong.

586
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,020
- Auntie. - Dong.

587
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,430
I made sweet & sour spareribs...

588
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,630
for the guests.

589
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:33,900
- I brought them over. - That's enough.

590
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:34,990
Help yourselves.

591
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:35,750
Thank you.

592
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,510
- So happy. - Cheers.

593
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:38,670
Cheers.

594
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:39,550
No bottoms up.

595
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,910
The food is getting cold.

596
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,910
- Let me get you a helping. - A toast to Xiaowan's Mom.

597
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,310
Must be tough for you.

598
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,350
Thank you.

599
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:47,990
So happy.

600
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,580
No bottoms up.

601
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,830
Half...

602
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:52,910
Cheers.

603
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,430
Miss Li, are you all right?

604
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,390
So happy.

605
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,030
Are you all right?

606
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,390
So happy.

607
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,030
So much happiness in this world.

608
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:35,150
Mother's love, brotherly love.

609
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:41,430
Enough love to get married. I've seen them all.

610
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:46,510
I thought they had gone extinct.

611
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:55,110
Did you see Xiaowan's Mom?

612
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:00,990
When you said you'd take care of Zhencong,

613
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,630
did you see how happy she looked?

614
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,860
Yes.

615
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:13,060
You know then how much she loves Xiaowan.

616
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,230
Yes.

617
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,190
You cried.

618
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,710
I did not.

619
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,030
Yes, you did.

620
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:22,950
I did not.

621
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:31,590
Yes, you did. Tears rolled down your face.

622
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,830
It's obvious you cried.

623
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,510
OK, I cried...

624
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,030
It's all right. Take it easy.

625
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:45,230
Everyone was crying

626
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,510
and everyone was happy.

627
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,660
Miss Li.

628
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,910
Everyone but me.

629
00:50:55,560 --> 00:51:02,870
My Mom is a bitch when she wants money.

630
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,620
What am I to her?

631
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,630
An ATM machine.

632
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:13,230
You look after your kid brother,

633
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:18,710
but everyone in my family is selfish.

634
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,070
You had too much to drink.

635
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,150
Miss Li.

636
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:31,990
Next time don't drink so much.

637
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,870
I did not.

638
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:40,710
Men always make me

639
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:47,260
drink a lot.

640
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,750
I used to be a hairstylist.

641
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,910
Right.

642
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,870
Hairstylists are cool.

643
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,990
But with no money? Cool my ass.

644
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,300
Right.

645
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,550
I'm not...

646
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,870
I'm not hungry for money.

647
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,910
I just don't want to be like my parents.

648
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:21,710
They bought a flat...

649
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,790
before they retired.

650
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:29,710
Now the family is stuck with the mortgage.

651
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:33,190
I have to give them $5,000 a month,

652
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,710
and I still have 9 more years to go.

653
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:42,190
9 years later,

654
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,150
I'll be 40 years old.

655
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,790
Right. Miss Li.

656
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,710
You will be fine...

657
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,860
just too much alcohol.

658
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:59,950
I want a man who won't make me pay mortgage.

659
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,190
I don't mind if he's married.

660
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,670
But he only wants my money,

661
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,300
not me.

662
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:20,710
It's all right. I'll go to Taiwan alone...

663
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,030
to Shanghai, to Beijing,

664
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:28,190
I don't care.

665
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:29,750
Stop it,

666
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,740
Miss Li.

667
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,830
- I'm tired. - Don't say it

668
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,910
Don't say it anymore, Miss Li.

669
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,950
Whenever you need me, I'll be there.

670
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,150
Miss Li.

671
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:54,710
Nobody would hire me for the last 6 months.

672
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:02,710
Even a mute is wanted but not me.

673
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,750
Miss Li.

674
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:11,270
Sorry,

675
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,870
but we don't approve of your business.

676
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,910
We have reviewed your file.

677
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:48,870
If you were in Hong Kong,

678
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,790
we would have approved your application,

679
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,300
but not here.

680
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:58,430
It's high risk for us as you're new at this.

681
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,830
Here's the kids' room. Get a feel for it.

682
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,190
- Not bad. - Think about it.

683
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,350
We have to go, Mr Fang. You'll hear from me.

684
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,230
Well?

685
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,190
If you want it, you must hurry.

686
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,350
I can't guarantee I can hold it.

687
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,820
I like it.

688
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:16,990
The price...

689
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,430
Negotiable. Let's talk back in the office.

690
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,030
- I'm sure you'll be happy. - All right.

691
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,390
You don't have to sell it.

692
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,230
Zhencong needs the money to get married.

693
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,870
You should think it over.

694
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,190
Maybe she'll find a job.

695
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,870
Then she won't need to borrow from you.

696
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:51,870
Zhencong will get his share.

697
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:54,550
I'm only loaning her my share.

698
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,350
"Alcohol is bad for you...best of luck to you."

699
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,020
Renovation starts on the 1st.

700
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,950
The carpenters arrive on the 2nd,

701
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,260
electricians on the 5th,

702
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:29,270
bricklayers from the 6th to the 1 0th.

703
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,070
They must clear out on the 1 1th,

704
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,590
because the furniture is here on the 12th.

705
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,150
Cleaning from the...

706
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,070
14th to the 16th,

707
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,990
worship ceremony on the 17th,

708
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,630
and we're open for business on the 18th.

709
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,140
Have some coffee.

710
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,350
Thanks.

711
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:51,950
You don't want any?

712
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,270
What's wrong?

713
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,670
She wants to borrow $20K more?

714
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,750
That's $300K altogether.

715
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,550
The price she paid for getting dumped.

716
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,190
You're not responsible for her.

717
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,310
It's not about responsibility.

718
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:25,670
I'm in love with her.

719
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:28,750
It's true.

720
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,350
I like to hear her

721
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:34,550
call me Fang Zhendong.

722
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:43,230
Fang Zhendong.

723
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,030
What are you doing?

724
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,190
What is going on?

725
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,190
You said nothing during the renovation.

726
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:00,030
Now you're starting trouble.

727
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,630
I don't know what happened before.

728
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,060
But this ceiling is...

729
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,790
against regulations.

730
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:05,790
Miss Li,

731
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,230
your wiring is illegal.

732
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,630
I can't be held responsible for accidents.

733
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,350
How would I know there's a problem?

734
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,110
I need to open for business tomorrow.

735
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:17,540
What do you expect me to do?

736
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:18,630
What is it?

737
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,430
Fang Zhendong. They're tearing down the shop.

738
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:22,710
Talk to them.

739
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,100
What's the problem?

740
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:29,830
The sprinkler and the wiring.

741
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,110
Can we put in an extra pipe over here?

742
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,670
No, you must tear it down.

743
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:37,870
Don't talk to them. Talk to their boss.

744
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,710
I had a contract.

745
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,300
I must open for business.

746
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,510
Let me talk to your boss.

747
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,070
Your wiring is against regulations.

748
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:50,310
Fang Zhendong, you're a cop.

749
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,550
Tell them to get the hell out.

750
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,060
This is not Hong Kong. You must obey the law.

751
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,110
Is there another solution?

752
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:05,790
Can we put in something? Take a look.

753
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,150
Her power supply is very problematic.

754
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,390
Uncle Dong.

755
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,260
Zhencong. Xiaowan.

756
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:42,830
Dong.

757
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:47,190
Wear this even if you're not wearing suits.

758
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,820
I know you're busy, so I bought them for you.

759
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,510
I'll make dinner.

760
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,870
Zhencong, is Dong all right?

761
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,310
He's all right.

762
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,350
Zhencong, the oil and vinegar...

763
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:25,870
Dong.

764
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,190
It's all right.

765
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,270
It's all right.

766
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:39,390
You...

767
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:42,590
I'll make dinner...

768
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,310
the oil...

769
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,270
The scanner shows blood stasis in your brain,

770
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,380
and you have sustained an injury.

771
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,380
Were you in an accident?

772
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:59,790
A few years ago when I caught a criminal.

773
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,310
The stasis is pressing against your nerves

774
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,590
and is affecting your memory.

775
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:08,700
Doctor, does he need surgery?

776
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:11,220
No, that's too risky. We'll try something more conventional.

777
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:13,580
What will happen?

778
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,190
Hard to say. Maybe nothing.

779
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:17,860
Or maybe you'll forget everything.

780
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,590
Xiaole, you're a real jerk.

781
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,030
What?

782
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:51,350
I said you're a jerk. Got it?

783
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,950
You betrayed your mentor.

784
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:58,310
I did nothing wrong. I told the truth.

785
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:01,350
He also told me, I must report every mistake.

786
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,670
He did use the patrol car to help his girl.

787
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:04,550
Shut up.

788
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:06,430
This is the precinct, not the cadet school.

789
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:08,710
You're not the prefect. Don't be a snitch.

790
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,870
You'll soon be the team leader too, you'll...

791
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:12,060
Stop it.

792
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,660
This is ridiculous.

793
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:17,790
Chief.

794
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:22,590
Xiaole.

795
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:27,820
You did the right thing. You learned from me.

796
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:30,590
I...

797
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:31,830
Shut up.

798
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:35,270
Dong, let's talk to the boss.

799
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,030
Everyone makes mistakes.

800
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:40,630
You can't say that, Zhu Tian.

801
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:43,950
You shouldn't try to cover it up.

802
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:48,510
One must own up to one's mistakes.

803
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:56,070
I've been a cop for over 1 0 years.

804
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,350
As an honest cop,

805
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:02,670
even when I'm not in uniform,

806
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:10,630
I'm still a cop, right?

807
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:30,790
"Only a bass guitar is left"

808
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:35,630
"listening to my heart."

809
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,630
"I miss you"

810
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:43,710
"in this empty room."

811
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:50,510
"My dreams have left me."

812
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:55,430
"I'm lost when I wake up."

813
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:59,990
"I keep searching"

814
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:03,750
"in this gloomy world."

815
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,100
Salute.

816
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:12,950
"I'm like a pathetic joke"

817
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:18,790
"holding onto thin air."

818
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:27,550
"Perhaps I should have given up,"

819
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:32,830
"given up meaningless courage."

820
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:37,030
"I should not hope for anything."

821
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:41,830
"I should not believe in miracles,"

822
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:48,070
"but go on living without any expectations."

823
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:53,910
"Nothing can be resolved."

824
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:58,830
"Why talk about the future? "

825
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:03,710
"I can't let go"

826
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,670
"my love for you."

827
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:13,590
"The silent guitar"

828
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:18,620
"is answering me quietly."

829
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:23,310
"I talk to myself"

830
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:27,790
"when it's raining in my heart."

831
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,540
The number you have dialed has been disconnected.

832
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:19,790
"I'm like a pathetic joke"

833
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:25,710
"holding onto thin air."

834
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:34,630
"Perhaps I should have given up,"

835
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:39,230
"given up meaningless courage."

836
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:43,990
"I should not hope for anything."

837
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:48,670
"I should not believe in miracles,"

838
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:54,310
"but go on living without any expectations."

839
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:05,670
"Nothing can be resolved."

840
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:10,390
"Why talk about the future? "

841
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:15,660
"I can't let go"

842
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:20,270
"my love for you."

843
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:25,030
"The silent guitar"

844
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:30,070
"is answering me quietly."

845
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:35,030
"I talk to myself"

846
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:42,270
"when it's raining in my heart."

847
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:51,100
Those of you tuning in,

848
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:52,110
are you aware of

849
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,880
someone around...

850
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,710
who gives you positive energy?

851
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,710
He may not be much of a talker,

852
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:01,910
nor is he very capable.

853
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:12,750
Swing hard. You understand?

854
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:13,980
Who is she?

855
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,310
My sister. Don't mind her.

856
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,430
Swing hard.

857
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,830
Dee is getting married.

858
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:03,910
You know his girlfriend lives here.

859
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,180
I'm not going to mind your business.

860
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:14,270
I have to pick up my daughter from school.

861
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:25,230
But tonight, I'll make an exception.

862
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:28,950
I'm willing to give John 20 seconds

863
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:31,310
to say something important.

864
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:55,830
Move in with me, my jewelry will be yours.

865
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,110
Fried rice noodles with soy sauce.

866
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,350
- Plain? - Yes.

867
01:12:58,560 --> 01:12:59,910
- $1 more for take out. - OK.

868
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,180
Thanks, Mom.

869
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:03,990
That's right.

870
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:14,030
No need.

871
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,870
Something moving needs not be earth shaking.

872
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,430
Something simple can be just as sweet.

873
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:28,630
Nancy said she hadn't received a hand-written letter

874
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:31,070
in over 1 0 years.

875
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:34,950
Today, she got one in the mail.

876
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,430
As she read it word by word,

877
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:40,870
she felt as if her friend was talking to her in person.

878
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,870
Because she remembered every word by heart.

879
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:15,070
"Don't be Lonely Fang Zhendong"

880
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:37,510
What is it, Sis?

881
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:42,110
Give me $1 00K. I'll move out tomorrow.

882
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:47,940
Forget the previous payments but I won't chip in anymore.

883
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:49,910
I'll transfer it to you tomorrow.

884
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:43,190
Is Zhendong home?

885
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:44,310
He moved.

886
01:15:58,040 --> 01:15:58,990
Don't wait here anymore.

887
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:00,590
Let me repeat:

888
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:02,310
I don't know where he is.

889
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,790
What is it, Miss Li?

890
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,070
I'm looking for Fang Zhendong.

891
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:14,060
He's gone.

892
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,190
Where to?

893
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:16,510
I don't know.

894
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:20,190
You should.

895
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,030
You worked with him for so long.

896
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,230
That's just your assumption.

897
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:27,070
I'm his friend.

898
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:29,230
Then you should know where he is.

899
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:36,110
Miss Li, what you want from me

900
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:39,070
is beyond my call of duty, understand?

901
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:41,390
Why won't you help me?

902
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,150
I'm here to make a report.

903
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,110
About what?

904
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:08,230
Fang Zhendong is missing. Find him.

905
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:10,380
How are you related?

906
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:16,070
I'm his girlfriend.

907
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:23,310
Occupation?

908
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:25,670
You want 3 bedrooms?

909
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,100
Facing the sun, right?

910
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:36,550
There's a studio flat in...

911
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:38,630
Chaoyang District.

912
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:41,230
Is Miss Li Peiru here?

913
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:43,140
Please wait.

914
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:46,670
Hello, I'm Li Peiru.

915
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,180
You're looking for Fang Zhendong?

916
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:54,790
Yes, I am.

917
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:05,390
When he moved, he left your things with me.

918
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,150
He said you'd come back for them.

919
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:20,620
Zhendong has cerebrovascular dementia.

920
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:25,710
He won't be able to look after himself,

921
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:27,660
Iet alone look after you.

922
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,670
He'll be increasingly dependent on others.

923
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:38,350
He's no longer the Zhendong you know.

924
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,510
If you leave him after you see him,

925
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:45,750
you shouldn't see him at all.

926
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:00,750
Will you tell him you love him?

927
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:35,590
I must let you off here, Miss.

928
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,390
- Straight ahead? - Yes, just go straight.

929
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:42,910
Thank you.

930
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,550
Where does Fang Zhendong live?

931
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:54,190
Go straight and make a turn.

932
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:55,950
Thank you.

933
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:19,260
Xiaowan.

934
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:23,630
How are you?

935
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,350
I'm fine.

936
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:32,830
Is it hard looking after them both?

937
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:42,230
"They're both trying very hard. We're OK."

938
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:46,510
What about you? Are you scared?

939
01:20:56,680 --> 01:21:00,630
"Being with the one I love, I'm not scared."

940
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,310
No need.

941
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:26,550
Want some cabbage?

942
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,110
Fang Zhendong.

943
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:34,710
Fang Zhendong.

944
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:38,590
Fang Zhendong.

945
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:47,900
What are you going to cook?

946
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:53,070
Why did you come back?

947
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,310
I said I wouldn't take advantage from you.

948
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:03,300
Go home.

949
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:11,070
I'm hungry. Can you serve me lunch first?

950
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:45,790
Go home after you finish eating.

951
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:19,430
Have some tea. Careful, it's hot.

952
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:33,510
Tell me about your condition.

953
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,510
I thought you wanted me to leave.

954
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,790
Maybe you can scare me off.

955
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:50,550
It's nothing. I'm becoming forgetful.

956
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:54,150
The doctor said it's a type of dementia.

957
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,750
Will you forget I owe you $300K?

958
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:13,830
Forget how much I hurt you?

959
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:25,630
Forget you promised you'd look after me?

960
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:27,230
Did I?

961
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:50,110
I know I should leave, given your condition.

962
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:55,860
I tried, but I couldn't.

963
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:01,230
I missed you all the time.

964
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:05,230
What should I do?

965
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:28,270
You're going to forget me anyway.

966
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:32,600
Now is all we have, right?

967
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:32,190
Why am I inside your glove?

968
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:34,020
Because you're cold.

969
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:38,830
I'm cold? Thanks for taking care of me.

970
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:42,750
You came back when I can't take care of you.

971
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,670
You have suffered enough.

972
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:47,750
You don't need a burden like me.

973
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:49,790
Eventually I'll have nothing.

974
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:58,150
Do you know even if I die tomorrow,

975
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:01,750
I'll have no regrets today because I see you.

976
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:03,750
The first time I saw you,

977
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:07,030
I already had no regrets after you kissed me.

978
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:08,790
I did?

979
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:13,830
It's probably her.

980
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,750
- Yes. - Maybe it was her?

981
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:18,670
I don't think I did.

982
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:22,390
Ouch.

983
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,830
Congratulations. I didn't expect a girl from Hong Kong

984
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:14,950
to be so loyal.

985
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:17,790
A real loyal girl.

986
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:36,150
Morning.

987
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:03,940
What are you doing?

988
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:07,870
I'm eating. What about you?

989
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:10,310
I want dumplings tonight.

990
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:18,150
Let's go.

991
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:33,350
You already fed the fish.

992
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:57,830
"Twice a day (morning and night)."

993
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:08,510
Starting today,

994
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:11,180
I'll remember how nice Zhendong is to me.

995
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:15,550
He won't forget.

996
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:18,950
I'll write it down for him.

997
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:27,940
Stop.

998
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:29,990
Wait, there are 1 3 of you.

999
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:30,630
there are 1 3 of you.

1000
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,030
No, just 12.

1001
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:34,430
I counted. I'm sure it's 1 3.

1002
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:35,860
Can you count?

1003
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,070
Quiet. We made a mistake.

1004
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:41,030
Please go in.

1005
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:16,630
Is Dong picking you up?

1006
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:24,270
You need to lock up?

1007
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:26,020
You have to go?

1008
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:27,910
I'll wait outside.

1009
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:30,110
All right, goodbye. Take it easy.

1010
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:56,270
Next stop : North Jinsong Bridge.

1011
01:31:56,520 --> 01:32:00,140
Please use the back door, swipe your card when you alight.

1012
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:02,510
I need to get off.

1013
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:06,620
I need to get off. Open the door.

1014
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,060
Open up.

1015
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:13,670
Open up.

1016
01:32:59,040 --> 01:32:59,750
There you are.

1017
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:07,340
You've been waiting for me?

1018
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:09,550
I knew you'd be here.

1019
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:15,830
Your hands are cold.

1020
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:21,630
I have a personal heater.

1021
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:23,390
I don't need you here.

1022
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:27,180
You sent me an angel.

1023
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:40,220
You're going to be a father.

1024
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:46,070
You don't like that?

1025
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:52,740
No, I...

1026
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:58,310
I didn't know you're willing to bear my baby.

1027
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:00,190
Why not?

1028
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:03,710
You know what I mean.

1029
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:05,430
I don't.

1030
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:10,230
I'm wearing you out.

1031
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:12,150
I don't know what you mean.

1032
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:14,310
I don't know what to say.

1033
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:15,780
You know I'm not good with words.

1034
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:18,580
Then I'll say it for you.

1035
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:22,100
Thank you.

1036
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:27,630
Thank you for letting me in your life.

1037
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:36,430
What did you say?

1038
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:00,700
I'm hungry.

1039
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,550
Let's eat...go get them.

1040
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:07,110
The food is ready.

1041
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:09,270
Zhencong, bring the rice.

1042
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:19,580
Hurry up, Zhencong.

1043
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:36,350
Just 20 more minutes.

1044
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:37,590
Sit down.

1045
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:42,190
Get in there. Move.

1046
01:35:59,640 --> 01:36:03,830
For the little one, Mom feels empty inside.

1047
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:07,390
When Dad is not happy,

1048
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:09,630
Mom feels even worse.

1049
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:11,580
You're inside me.

1050
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:15,430
You feel my heart pounding

1051
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:17,630
every time I see your Dad?

1052
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:21,870
I never wanted to be a mother,

1053
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:23,550
but Dad makes me...

1054
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:28,190
proud to be a mother.

1055
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:31,750
What is it?

1056
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:34,380
I lost $400.

1057
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:36,830
I lost $400.

1058
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:41,540
I lost $400.

1059
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,030
I lost $400.

1060
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:51,820
I lost $400.

1061
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:29,590
You don't have to work?

1062
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:31,990
I...

1063
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:41,310
Why are you following me? Go home.

1064
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:46,310
Go away.

1065
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:48,860
Go away.

1066
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:50,070
Be careful.

1067
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:53,390
Dong.

1068
01:37:53,640 --> 01:37:54,390
I'm sorry.

1069
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:56,070
I'm fine.

1070
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:57,350
Go away.

1071
01:37:58,360 --> 01:37:59,030
I'm fine.

1072
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:01,870
Dong.

1073
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:03,430
Go away.

1074
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:18,910
He's worried. He wants to protect you.

1075
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:21,070
Him?

1076
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:26,350
He's worried about the money you're carrying.

1077
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:30,430
How does he know? You told him?

1078
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:37,030
You take care of us three.

1079
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:39,870
Are we after your money?

1080
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:47,980
He can't protect me.

1081
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:21,350
Hold me... I'm scared.

1082
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:25,750
You pushed me away.

1083
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:52,580
You must remember me. Don't abandon me.

1084
01:39:58,040 --> 01:39:59,790
What if I give you...

1085
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:06,070
a hard time every day?

1086
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:14,510
Xiaowan said being with the one you love,

1087
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:16,550
there's nothing to be afraid of.

1088
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:45,510
Her heart is strong.

1089
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:49,420
Just like her Dad.

1090
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:55,550
Come on in. Drop by anytime.

1091
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:57,070
Why did you bring all these?

1092
01:40:57,280 --> 01:41:00,110
My wife's friend owns a shop.

1093
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:01,580
Everything is at cost.

1094
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:02,670
Where's Peiru?

1095
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:04,550
Inside...she's cooking.

1096
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,620
Hello.

1097
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:07,550
- We're here to bum a meal. - You bought so much.

1098
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:08,590
You're too kind.

1099
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:09,860
Don't mention it.

1100
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:10,830
Here...

1101
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:11,710
- Sit down. - Sit down.

1102
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:14,030
Auntie. Xiaowan. Zhencong.

1103
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:15,030
Come.

1104
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:15,830
Auntie, let me help you.

1105
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:18,600
No...you're here to eat.

1106
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:19,670
Then I'll wait.

1107
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:21,510
You're so happy.

1108
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:24,150
We got married before you did,

1109
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:26,270
and we still don't have children.

1110
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:27,750
Just live with it.

1111
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:28,910
White wine or beer?

1112
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:29,750
Anything.

1113
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:30,750
I'll get it.

1114
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:32,020
Thanks.

1115
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,230
Auntie, you're such a good cook.

1116
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:39,630
Then you should eat more.

1117
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:40,620
- Definitely. - Zhu Tian.

1118
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:41,950
Let's drink this.

1119
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:43,670
Come. No problem.

1120
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:45,230
Have you decided on a name?

1121
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:46,110
Yes.

1122
01:41:46,280 --> 01:41:47,110
What is it?

1123
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:54,750
One word.

1124
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:56,620
One word?

1125
01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:58,980
It's...

1126
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:00,950
Stop guessing.

1127
01:42:01,160 --> 01:42:03,230
Ming. As in to engrave on one's mind.

1128
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:04,070
Right.

1129
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:05,300
- Fang Ming. - Fang Ming.

1130
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:06,030
Good name.

1131
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:07,110
- Sounds good. - Not bad?

1132
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:08,540
Pour the wine.

1133
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:13,310
You'll have an amazing baby.

1134
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:14,670
Sit down.

1135
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:15,790
Thanks.

1136
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:16,750
Here we go...

1137
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:17,940
You should sit down, Auntie.

1138
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:19,140
Sit down and eat.

1139
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:26,870
I was transferred in 1 994.

1140
01:42:27,320 --> 01:42:29,950
I was in my 20s then, about your age,

1141
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:31,870
but more capable than you.

1142
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:34,270
You don't believe me?

1143
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:37,710
Ask Guiping. Shen Guiping,

1144
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:40,590
you don't know him?

1145
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:44,910
He knows, where is Guiping?

1146
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:46,030
Tell him to come over.

1147
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:49,630
Guiping and I were on beat every day,

1148
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:52,790
3 hours a day, and finished by 16:30.

1149
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,790
We made a big circle from north of Sanlitun.

1150
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:59,350
I wrote and handed in the reports at 17:00.

1151
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:01,670
Guiping has gone to Tianjin.

1152
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:10,150
Cut the crap.

1153
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:11,990
You're new?

1154
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:13,150
What do you know?

1155
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:16,220
You're picking on me. You look down on me?

1156
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:19,140
Why are you always picking on me?

1157
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:22,860
Listen, I'd risk my life when I work.

1158
01:43:23,240 --> 01:43:25,670
I risk my life...

1159
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:27,870
When I arrested that fugitive in 1995,

1160
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:30,230
I ran 3 blocks after that bastard.

1161
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:31,700
In order to get away,

1162
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:33,230
that bastard pushed a kid out on the street.

1163
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:34,900
He was almost run over by a car.

1164
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:37,150
I was wounded when I saved the kid's life.

1165
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:39,980
I spent 3 days in the hospital.

1166
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:45,790
When I got home, my brother...

1167
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,220
didn't speak to me for 3 months.

1168
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:50,140
He was scared.

1169
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:52,740
He'd have nothing...

1170
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:54,030
if I were dead.

1171
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:57,350
You know what? I can't die.

1172
01:43:59,000 --> 01:43:59,980
And you?

1173
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:04,100
You guys look down on me.

1174
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:06,030
You all look down on me.

1175
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:08,110
I know, it's just a job.

1176
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:11,710
Because my marriage failed? I didn't care.

1177
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:14,310
My ex ran off with another man. I didn't care.

1178
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:16,910
I slaved on my job...

1179
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:19,150
for over 1 0 years.

1180
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:22,750
I was never promoted. I didn't care either.

1181
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:24,830
Know why I'm still alive?

1182
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:27,030
My wife is having a baby,

1183
01:44:27,240 --> 01:44:29,070
my baby.

1184
01:44:29,400 --> 01:44:32,710
I can't give her a better life,

1185
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:34,990
I...Iisten...

1186
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:37,710
In order to let my baby...

1187
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:39,270
grow up healthily,

1188
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:41,350
I must come back to work. I need to work.

1189
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:44,910
I want to come back and be a good cop,

1190
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:45,910
OK?

1191
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:46,910
Calm down, Dong.

1192
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:48,070
Fang Zhendong.

1193
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:56,110
Are you all right?

1194
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:59,270
I'm fine. Zhu Tian brought me along.

1195
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:03,390
He said you need a physical before you come back to work.

1196
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:04,990
A physical?

1197
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:08,510
Yes, Zhu Tian went for a physical.

1198
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:09,790
That's the regulation.

1199
01:45:10,120 --> 01:45:13,110
Right, let's go.

1200
01:45:15,120 --> 01:45:17,310
The police is responsible for the public.

1201
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:19,510
You must stay healthy, right?

1202
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:21,750
Your wife is absolutely right.

1203
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:24,910
Are you scared to go?

1204
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:29,430
No...I don't know.

1205
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:31,110
You don't know? Let's go now,

1206
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:32,350
you can come back to work tomorrow.

1207
01:45:32,760 --> 01:45:33,230
Good.

1208
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:35,190
I'll go with you.

1209
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:36,820
Let me carry that.

1210
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:43,150
Slow down. Why did you run?

1211
01:45:45,120 --> 01:45:47,110
- I'm sorry. - Dong.

1212
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:51,270
- I'm sorry. - Dong.

1213
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:53,860
Slow down.

1214
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:40,270
You're up early.

1215
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:45,190
I'm disturbing you?

1216
01:46:51,560 --> 01:46:52,910
I was chatting with my father.

1217
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:55,820
Your father?

1218
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:03,270
He makes musical instruments. He's reticent.

1219
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:07,380
I talk to him through music.

1220
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:09,910
We were just chatting.

1221
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:12,990
What did you talk about?

1222
01:47:15,240 --> 01:47:16,510
I sang him a song.

1223
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:41,910
Now I remember the lyrics I used to forget.

1224
01:47:43,640 --> 01:47:46,200
I'll sing it to you.

1225
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:53,510
Fang Zhendong.

1226
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:56,500
He's coming.

1227
01:47:58,520 --> 01:47:59,710
Fang Ming is on his way.

1228
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:22,950
The baby's head didn't turn.

1229
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:24,550
Should we save the mother

1230
01:48:24,920 --> 01:48:25,900
or the baby?

1231
01:48:26,440 --> 01:48:30,510
The mother. Save my wife, thanks.

1232
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,670
Don't cry.

1233
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,060
Fang Ming.

1234
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:26,510
3 spoonfuls.

1235
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,510
Wipe it, slowly.

1236
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:14,070
Are you hungry, baby?

1237
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:17,150
Let's check if we need to change the diaper.

1238
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:20,110
The baby is hungry.

1239
01:50:20,440 --> 01:50:22,670
Wait. How much did you put in?

1240
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:23,630
3 spoonfuls.

1241
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:34,230
You think I screwed up?

1242
01:50:37,080 --> 01:50:37,670
Do it yourself.

1243
01:51:03,800 --> 01:51:05,070
Zhencong.

1244
01:51:18,360 --> 01:51:19,110
What are you doing?

1245
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:21,870
Stop. Police.

1246
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:27,700
Stop.

1247
01:51:29,120 --> 01:51:29,870
Stop.

1248
01:51:40,760 --> 01:51:41,430
Stop.

1249
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:47,510
Stop.

1250
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:52,310
Stop.

1251
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:39,390
Dong.

1252
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:41,750
Dong.

1253
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:16,910
What happened? Where's your brother?

1254
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:39,270
We have a tough road ahead.

1255
01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:43,310
I can't go on without you.

1256
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:46,830
Without you, I can't smile.

1257
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:52,620
The baby needs to know how amazing you are.

1258
01:53:55,760 --> 01:53:59,590
I still have a burden even without you.

1259
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:04,510
I can't go on without you.

1260
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:09,510
Remember

1261
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:11,940
you promised me

1262
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:18,990
you'd come to me whenever I called your name?

1263
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:34,390
Fang Zhendong.

1264
01:54:36,720 --> 01:54:38,870
You said you're a lifesaver.

1265
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:42,990
Here's a damsel in distress.

1266
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:46,070
Wake up.

1267
01:54:52,360 --> 01:54:53,340
Thanks.

1268
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:19,600
You haven't rested for 3 nights.

1269
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:20,590
Are you OK?

1270
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:23,350
You're running a fever. Let's go see the doc.

1271
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:25,710
I'm all right.

1272
01:55:27,120 --> 01:55:28,100
I'll be right back.

1273
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:36,350
Mr Fang, your wife is sick. I'm taking her to see the doctor.

1274
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:38,030
Let's go.

1275
01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:40,380
Let's go.

1276
01:55:40,760 --> 01:55:41,790
I'll be back.

1277
01:55:43,120 --> 01:55:43,830
Slowly...

1278
01:55:48,440 --> 01:55:50,740
Mrs Fang.

1279
01:55:51,120 --> 01:55:52,910
Doctor.

1280
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:52,510
What's your name? I remember you.

1281
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:53,670
Fang Zhendong.

1282
01:56:57,680 --> 01:56:58,660
Fang Zhendong.

1283
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:03,710
Fang Zhendong.

1284
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:06,550
Relax. I won't take advantage of you.

1285
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:07,900
You can pay me back later.

1286
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:14,550
It's all right, Miss Li.

1287
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:20,030
Whenever you need me, I'll be there.

1288
01:57:24,040 --> 01:57:26,030
Fang Zhendong.

1289
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:28,950
What are you going to cook?

1290
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:33,150
I'm hungry. Can you serve me lunch first?

1291
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:39,190
You've been waiting for me?

1292
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:41,070
I knew you'd be here.

1293
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:44,940
You sent me an angel.

1294
01:58:02,720 --> 01:58:03,910
Fang Zhendong.

1295
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:07,100
Fang Zhendong.

1296
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:10,550
Fang Zhendong.

1297
01:58:32,920 --> 01:58:34,060
Fang Zhendong.

1298
01:58:37,600 --> 01:58:38,740
I'm sorry to make you worry.

1299
01:58:54,080 --> 01:58:56,110
You tied me over.

1300
01:59:48,920 --> 01:59:49,900
Don't cry.

1301
02:00:09,800 --> 02:00:14,920
The baby's name is Fang Ming. As in engraving on one's mind.

1302
02:00:16,680 --> 02:00:19,670
Tell her this name is for Mom.

1303
02:00:20,760 --> 02:00:21,820
So Dad would remember Mom.
