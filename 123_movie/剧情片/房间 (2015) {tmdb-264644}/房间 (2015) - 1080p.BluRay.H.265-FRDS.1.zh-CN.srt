00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:51,917
靠
Shit.

00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:58,424
山姆
Sam.

4
00:00:58,426 --> 00:01:01,093
山姆  醒醒
Sam, wake up.

5
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:02,394
怎么啦
What's wrong?

6
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:06,131
靠
Fuck.

7
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:07,967
泰格  你怎么搞的
What'd you do, Tiger?

8
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:11,337
-啥时候睡过去的  -混蛋  你说呢
- When did we crash? - You tell us, asshole.

9
00:01:11,339 --> 00:01:13,906
不知不觉就睡过去了
I guess I fell asleep.

10
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:14,940
嗯...
Yeah...

11
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:16,809
引擎都没关
with the engine running.

12
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:21,380
手机充满电了
Fully charged.

13
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:22,548
昨晚你打电话到没电?
Did you kill the battery too?

14
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,250
听到收音机里讲的吗
You hear the radio?

15
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:32,825
离这儿11英里远的地方有个室内溜冰场
There's a skating rink about 11 miles from here.

16
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:34,326
外面停车场很大
Big parking lot.

17
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:37,162
轮滑场还是溜冰场?
Ice skating or rollerskating?

18
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:38,264
只说他们还开放
Just says they're open.

19
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:39,198
咋啦
Why?

20
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,066
玩曲棍球风险更牛逼
Hockey players whoop more ass.

21
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:41,994
兄弟  这可不好说
I don't know, dude.

22
00:01:41,995 --> 00:01:43,435
也见过不少轮滑玩得漂亮的
I've seen some pretty bad-ass roller skaters.

23
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,104
7点就去么
At 7:00 AM?

24
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:47,373
好吧  我也去

00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:32,878
太好了
Awesome.

27
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,512
我上夜班  但明天早餐时可以赶来见你们
Hey, I work nights, but I'll catch up with you guys for breakfast.

28
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:36,715
-好  -我的房间是楼上右转第二间
- Okay. - I'm in 2-R up the stairs.

29
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,385
凑合着过一晚  呃  车子停路边就好
Just crash wherever. Uh, park in the side lot.

30
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:41,353
后车门靠紧墙边  这样没人能偷车里东西
Rear doors tight to the walls so no one steals your shit.

31
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:42,588
就这么着
All right.

32
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:04,009
房里的所有东西都快长毛了
These all have mushrooms.

33
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:05,411
这小子是个好人
This dude's legit.

34
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,680
啥  就因为他下午5点起床
Why? 'Cause he wakes up at 5:00 in the morning

35
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,282
在头发里打上摩丝去上班么
to put jizz in his hair?

36
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,585
不  我是说他很实诚
No. He's true.

37
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:20,192
喂  呆鸟
Ree-Ree.

38
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,363
给谁电话呢
Who you callin'?

39
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:25,998
关你什么事
Is that your business?

40
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,533
手机账单可是我付
I get the bills.

41
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:29,334
我去睡觉了
I'm going to bed.

42
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:31,070
一起喝酒吧
We're gonna drink.

43
00:04:31,072 --> 00:04:32,604
一  二  三  四  一  二  三  四
One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four ?

44
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,606
Legalize
Legalize ?

45
00:04:58,065 --> 00:04:59,264
早上好
Mornin'.

46
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:01,233
你好
Hello.

47
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:03,155
你第一个睡过去的吗
You were the first to fall asleep?

48
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:15,662
好  我是来自华盛顿特区来的
Okay, I'm with the Ain't Rights

49
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:17,149
"非我权利"乐队成员
from Washington, D.C.

50
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:18,750
呃  严格说来  我们来自阿林顿
Uh, technically, we're from Arlington.

51
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:22,387
不错  不过这曲子是为"锡赛德动力"写的
Nice. Uh, and this is for Seaside HCFM.

52
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:23,622
不是电子杂志
Not for the zine?

53
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:25,257
那个我会另写一个版本
I'll do a print version for that,

54
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,059
要是你们没意见的话
but this will run on our college station.

55
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:28,160
这首曲子将在我们的大学电台播放
Uh, if that's cool.

56
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:29,128
好
Yeah.

57
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,763
说说看  你们乐队有没有出什么新东西
So, you guys working on anything new?

58
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:33,298
嗯  有几首新歌
Mm, yeah. A few songs.

59
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,167
大概够一张七英寸唱片的容量
Maybe enough for, like, a seven inch.

60
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,768
行啊  打算出版唱片吗
Sweet. Will you actually press one?

61
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,237
好说  能付起出版费就干
Yeah, if we can afford it.

62
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:40,139
哦  咋不  我认真研究了谱曲风格
Yeah, no, I really dig the analog style.

63
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:41,507
这让我意识到
Uh, which brings me to the fact

64
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:43,175
你们这样的乐队可是打着灯笼都难找啊
you guys are hard to find.

65
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,843
为何不在媒体露露面呢
Why no social media presence?

66
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,279
因为签下更多的演出
That's because booking more shows,

67
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:49,181
卖出更多的唱片  会坏事
selling more records would blow.

要与时俱进...
And it's shared live...

82

不然就完了
and then it's over.

83

灵感不在
The energy can't last.

84
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,245
{\an8}Iggy Pop  伊基・波普
原始  颓废的摇滚的象征性歌手  音乐家

85
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,245
除非你是伊基・波普
Unless you're Iggy Pop.

86
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:21,813
他是不错  但我可不想
Yeah, well good for him, but I don't think I wanna

87
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:24,683
七十岁时还在听着小凶兆乐队的歌
be in my 70's still listening to Minor Threat.

88
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:25,597
泰格就爱听
But Tiger does.

89
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:27,119
我可活不过七十岁  所以...
I won't live to be 70, so...

90
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,821
好  好  依照我的惯例
Okay, so, uh, this is a good seg

91
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,156
细分音乐风格
into one of my traditions.

92
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:32,319
对你们每个人考量
Uh, for each of you,

93
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,126
我给你们起名叫荒岛乐园乐队
name your desert island band.

94
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:35,661
就一个可选?
Only one?

95
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:38,764
假如我称自己为"黑色安息日"
If I were to say Black Sabbath,

96
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:41,166
是不是可以得到奥齐和迪欧
would I get Ozzy and Dio?

97
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:43,535
没别的意思  就给你们乐队取个名而已
No caveats. Just name the band.

98
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:44,636
好
Okay.

99
00:06:46,207 --> 00:06:47,439
错配乐队
Misfits.

100
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:49,174
不行  太糟
No, The Damned.

101
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:50,676
-嗯... -我去  错配乐队
- Um... - Oh, fuck it. Misfits.

102
00:06:50,678 --> 00:06:52,611
-毒药想法  -克罗-马格
- Poison Idea. - Cro-Mags.

103
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:54,279
这名字不错
That's a good one also.

104
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:55,781
兄弟  你怎么不说点什么
Why don't you say something, dude?

105
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:58,250
斯迪利・丹怎么样
What about Steely Dan?

106
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,102
唔  不  蜡烛盒怎样
Hm. No, Candlebox

107
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:00,719
他是个肥佬
He's a juggalo.

108
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:04,489
-啊...呀... -小甜甜布兰妮
- Uh... uh... - Britney Spears?

109
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:07,226
喂...你...你会把这段对话
Hey... hey, you... you... you're gonna

110
00:07:07,228 --> 00:07:08,927
-剪辑掉  对吧  -是会做些整理
-edit this, right? -I can chop it up a bit.

111
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,886
啊  原汁原味岂不更好
Oh, you should let it go raw, man.

112
00:07:10,887 --> 00:07:11,930
什么时候上广播台
Um, when is this gonna air?

113
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,799
我们好做演出
Like, maybe we should plug the show?

114
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,934
这个  呃...
Yeah. Um...

115
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:20,681
我在纽约市政中心组织的最后一场演出
My last show at The Muni Center

116
00:07:20,682 --> 00:07:21,373
结局不太好
didn't end well.

117
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:25,244
很多观众大吐口水  甚至扔秽物
Uh, lots of vomit, some fecal matter.

118
00:07:25,246 --> 00:07:27,479
委员会知道了风声  暂扣了我的许可证
County commissioner got wind and pulled my permit.

119
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:29,881
但你们的演出我已排上日程
You guys were already en route.

120
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:32,251
不行  你得给我们议付费
No, you gotta give us a kill fee.

121
00:07:32,253 --> 00:07:34,183
开了90英里赶过来
We went 90 miles out of our way.

122
00:07:34,184 --> 00:07:35,520
有个后备乐队等着呢
I've got a backup lined up.

123
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,723
午餐送上门  费用减免50%
Um, lunch, 50% cut on the door,

124
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:39,391
包你们上头条
and you guys would headline.

125
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:42,227
还有什么说的
Is anyone still on the bill?

126
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:43,495
没了
No.

127
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,437
{\an9}* I'm always broke *

128
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,605
{\an9}* And I'm alone *

129
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:55,207
{\an9}* I ask myself *

130
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:59,344
{\an9}* What have I become *

131
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,647
{\an9}* What have I become *

132
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:05,250
{\an9}* I must be drunk *

133
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:07,219

147
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:44,022

148
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:47,826
好吧  我们得抄近路回华盛顿特区
All right, so we'd have to beeline to DC.

149
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,261
现在油箱是满的
We have enough for one tank.

150
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:50,562
路上油不够  只有用虹吸管去偷了
We'd have to siphon the rest of the way.

151
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:51,563
不是问题
That's not a problem.

152

有米饭和豆类
We got rice and beans.

153

We can head up north. Take the 80 all the way.

154
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,469
老兄  你在做什么
What the fuck you doing, man?

155

就唱[场景已逝]
Scene is dead.

159
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:05,657
在靠近波特兰附近
You'd have to dip down closer to Portland.

160
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,552
该抢走那家伙收藏的黑胶唱片
I say we just gank his vinyl.

161
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,590
好啦  已安排妥当

167
00:09:27,368 --> 00:09:28,668
呃  事先说下
And, um, just so you know,

168
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:30,836
那地方是马丁靴  高帮鞋的天下
it's mostly boots and braces down there.

169
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:32,337
光头党  每场演出都有见到
Skins? There's some at every show.

170
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,072

Uh, right-wing, or technically ultra-left,

172
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:38,076
但并没成组织
but not affiliated.

173
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,545
-你表哥还好吧  -好  好
- And your cousin's cool? - Yeah, yeah.

174
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,881
别谈政治  跟着丹尼尔
Uh, don't talk politics, but stick with Daniel.

175
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:43,752
我本想跟着去
I'd tag along,

176
00:09:43,753 --> 00:09:45,384
但丹尼尔要带他女友来我这儿暂住
but he and his girl are coming here to crash.

177
00:09:45,386 --> 00:09:46,418
买吸尘器之类的
Gotta vacuum and shit.

178
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,520

So they're not, like, burning crosses

179
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:49,379
之类的  对吧

180
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,522
就是说  我们唱摇滚就好

181
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:52,357
演出一些早期的东西

重金属之类
Heavier stuff.

183
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,263
一般我会保留原本
I usually keep the originals,

184
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,097
但这个还没画完...
but since this one never happened...

185
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,732
演出协议继续吗

186

00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:23,301
呃...
Uh...

414
00:23:25,438 --> 00:23:27,205
毒...毒物进化
To... Toxic Evolution.

415
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,375
哥们  唱得真艰难
It's fucking hard, man.

416
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:35,746
就像我对地上的妞做的事一样艰难
That's the one I did her to.

417
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:51,729
好  枪只有六颗子弹...
All right, he's got six bullets...

418
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:52,454
真要干吗
For real?

419
00:23:52,455 --> 00:23:53,631
...要是我们一起上...
...if we all go at once...

420
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:55,499
-伙计们  打断一下  -做什么
- Guys, hold off a sec. - For what?

421
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:57,702
-我们几个什么都没干  -这不重要
- We haven't done anything! - It doesn't matter.

422
00:23:57,704 --> 00:24:01,172
人们称之为枪弹
Okay. They're called cartridges.

423
00:24:01,174 --> 00:24:04,508
再叽叽歪歪的话
The bullet is the part that enters your brain

424
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,777
枪弹的一部分  弹头将射入你的大脑
if you keep talking shit.

425
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:10,881
这支枪只有五发弹药  不是六发
And this gun only has five cartridges, not six,

426
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:14,919
枪弹个头过大  转轮只能装进五发
'cause they're big as fuck and only five fit the cylinder.

427
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:21,259
别考验我的耐性  都给我闭上鸟嘴
So, please shut the fuck up and don't test me.

428
00:24:21,261 --> 00:24:22,660
里斯  别把事情弄得更糟
Reece, you're making it worse.

429
00:24:22,662 --> 00:24:25,930
坐下  安静等待
We sit and we wait.

430
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:27,632
等死吗
And we die?

431
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:30,334
安静坐着等就不会
Not if you sit and you wait.

432
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:33,271
只有3点45分一个电话报警
It's just the one to 911 at 3:45

433
00:24:33,273 --> 00:24:35,253
接着是我3点47分打的
and then mine was at 3:47.

434
00:24:35,254 --> 00:24:35,913
你打过电话
You called?

435
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:38,376
-警局回电  我接的  -说清楚
- 911 called back and I answered. - Be clear.

436
00:24:38,378 --> 00:24:39,722
除了在场的还有谁...
Who else knows besides...

437
00:24:39,723 --> 00:24:40,945
你提起过丹尼尔的表弟
You said Daniel's cousin?

438
00:24:40,947 --> 00:24:42,397
泰得
Tad.

439
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:43,848
昨晚我们这儿是有人发了个短信给他
There was a text from him last night with our address,

440
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:44,915
但泰得并不知情
but he doesn't know anything.

441
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:47,718
除了认识留在屋里的是谁  来自哪儿...
Except who they are, where they are...

442
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,688
更可能知道他们要去往那里
maybe where they're supposed to be next.

443
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,056
靠
Fuck.

444
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,659
查查邮件
Check emails.

445
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:56,861
昨晚他们可是当众演奏
They played their set to the crowd.

446
00:24:56,863 --> 00:24:58,863
只能当是有人知道他们的行踪
Then we'll assume the wide world knows

447
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:00,965
并终将有人会找过来
and they'll be tracking that.

448
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:02,400
那个给我
Give it to me.

449
00:25:02,402 --> 00:25:03,768
只是想争取些时间
I was trying to buy some time

450
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,503
控制局面直到...
and contain this until we could...

451
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:07,238
控制
Contain?

452
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,572
事态像野火一样蔓延开来
It was pretty rapid fire.

453
00:25:08,574 --> 00:25:13,344
大家都喜欢乌姆  感激你挺身而出
I appreciate your initiative and we all love Werm.

454
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:14,645
他可是自家兄弟
He's a brother.

455
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:17,315
就算他进了监狱  你照样可以探访他啊
And you might have visited him in prison.

456
00:25:18,551 --> 00:25:19,917
有分别嘛
Makes a difference.

457
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,521
现在局面搞得进退两难
Now we're all in the stew

458
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:25,923
就因为乌姆一时冲动
for an impulsive act,

459
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:28,426
不为他人着想的家伙
for a selfish act,

460
00:25:28,428 --> 00:25:31,295
在我的屋檐下做出这种事
under my roof.

461
00:25:31,297 --> 00:25:33,597
可有解决之道?
You see a way out of this?

462
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:35,966
对屋里那些人吗?
For them?

463
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:37,335
没
No.

464
00:25:37,337 --> 00:25:38,736
还是得想个办法
We still have to find one.

465
00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:45,576
好  还算好
Okay. This is good.

466
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,331
他们没带枪
No guns.

467
00:25:50,332 --> 00:25:52,783
房子前面可立了"请勿擅闯"的牌子
You have a "No trespassing" sign posted at the residence?

468
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:54,385
写了"内有恶犬"
We got "Beware of dogs."

469
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:55,686
那敢情好
That's better.

470
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:03,828
有没有人知道我们上这儿来了
Does anyone even know we're in here?

471
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,664
-没有在乎咱们的人知道  -泰得呢
-No one who cares. -Tad?

472
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,504
-我们该走出去  -是该出去
- I think we go. - I think we go too.

473
00:26:15,508 --> 00:26:17,308
下个敢乱动的人...
The next person that moves...

474
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,310
里面的人没事吧
Everyone okay?

475
00:26:19,312 --> 00:26:21,345
就要有人倒霉了
Just about.

476
00:26:21,347 --> 00:26:22,646
盖比
Gabe?

477
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:23,748
-对  开门  -不
- Yeah. Open up. - No!

478
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,049
-警察在哪儿  -好...
- Where are the cops? - Okay...

479
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:26,317
你是让我开门呢
do you want me to open the door,

480
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:28,452
还是开枪把你的脑袋轰掉
or do you want me to blow your fucking head off?

481
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:31,455
-给我退后  -怎么啦
- Back the fuck off! - What's going on?

482
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:32,556
他们想一轰而上
They're trying to run at me!

483
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:33,724
别对他们开枪
Do not shoot them!

484
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:34,891
这么说吧  这可得看他们的
You know what? That's on them.

485
00:26:34,894 --> 00:26:35,893
警察在哪
Where are the cops?

486
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:37,495
把枪给他们
Give them the gun!

487
00:26:37,497 --> 00:26:39,697
再说次
Say again?

488
00:26:39,699 --> 00:26:41,365
事情结束了
It's over!

489
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:42,767
把枪给他们
Give them the gun.

490
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:45,035
可跟你说过他们想一轰而上...
Okay, I told you they just tried to run at me...

491
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:46,604
那就把子弹取出来
Then take the bullets out!

492
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:47,805
快把枪给他们
Just hand it over now!

493
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:49,774
别对他们开枪
Do not shoot them!

494
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:51,142
达西来了吗
Is Darcy here?

495
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:54,378
-来了  -我在
- He is. - I am.

496
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,732
里面各位  我是业主
Gentlemen, I'm the owner.

497
00:26:56,733 --> 00:26:58,749
好吧  跟我直说不就行了
Okay, why the fuck didn't you just tell me?

498
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:00,117
这一切真的很抱歉
Truly sorry about this.

499
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,119
正在了解事情经过
Playing catch-up here myself.

500
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,821
这只是在做戏
They're playing a fucking show.

501
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:05,990
呃...
Uh...

502
00:27:05,992 --> 00:27:08,592
谢谢你  但是...
thank you, but...

503
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:10,394
见到警察  我们才开门
we open the door for the police,

504
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:12,730
或者让我们保留子弹
or we keep the bullets.

505
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:15,566
对  是枪子弹
Uh, the cartridges.

506
00:27:15,568 --> 00:27:16,834
没问题
I've got no problem with that.

507
00:27:16,836 --> 00:27:18,969
好  枪给他们
Okay, I handed them the gun.

508
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,738
-我这就出门  -不行  不能走
-I'm gonna head out now. -No, you're not.

509
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,590
-让他开门走吧  -等等
- Let him open the door. - Hang on.

510
00:27:22,591 --> 00:27:23,961
枪都给了我们  枪给了我们...
No, he gave us the gun, he gave us the gun...

511
00:27:23,962 --> 00:27:24,441
没人可以...
Nobody is...

512
00:27:24,444 --> 00:27:27,378
指挥做这做那  枪都给你们了  好不
letting me do anything. I gave you the goddamn gun, okay?

513
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,712
-该怎么办  -他说得对
- So how are we doing? - He's right.

514
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:30,614
帕特  心里盘算下
Pat, do the math.

515
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:34,652
-警察在哪儿  -还得多等会儿
- Where are the police? - It takes a while out here.

516
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:37,922
-退后  -在等警察的同时
- Stay back. - Just want to make sure that no one else gets hurt

517
00:27:37,924 --> 00:27:39,957
不想让更多人受伤
in the meantime.

518
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,918
该死的  枪都给了你们...
Okay, I gave you the damn gun...

519
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:46,096
泰格
Tiger!

520
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:50,601
-把他弄倒  -贾斯汀
- Get him down! - Justin?

521
00:27:50,603 --> 00:27:51,869
把他弄倒
Get him down!

522
00:27:54,574 --> 00:27:56,294
怎么回事
What's happening?

523
00:28:01,948 --> 00:28:02,947
嘘
Shh!

524
00:28:02,949 --> 00:28:04,482
贾斯汀
Justin?

525
00:28:04,484 --> 00:28:07,117
谁叫你锁门的  活该
Shouldn't have locked the door.

526
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,552
见鬼  山姆
Shit. Sam!

527
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,025
拿子弹
Get the bullets!

528
00:28:18,731 --> 00:28:20,147
好好  快装子弹
All right, load the gun.

529
00:28:20,148 --> 00:28:21,564
-里面究竟怎么回事  -没啥好事
- How's it going in there? - Not good!

530
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:25,002
好  但我们宁愿等警察
Fine, but we would rather wait for the police!

531
00:28:25,004 --> 00:28:26,537
贾斯汀
Justin?

532
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:28,179
他没事...
He's fine...

533
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:31,108
但要他跟我们一起等
but he's gonna wait too!

534
00:28:34,614 --> 00:28:35,946
明白了
Understood, gentlemen.

535
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:38,116
好好等着
Hold tight.

536
00:28:40,453 --> 00:28:41,986
你觉得里面的人知道?
You think they know?

537
00:28:41,988 --> 00:28:43,821
可比你聪明得多
I think they're smarter than you!

538
00:28:43,823 --> 00:28:44,889
达西...
Darcy...

539
00:28:45,992 --> 00:28:47,024
老兄
Man.

540
00:28:49,862 --> 00:28:50,862
跟你道歉
I apologize.

541
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,861
只能这样干  封好路
We'll do it here. Stage it up the road. Okay.

542
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,663
哥们  这人好疯狂
Hey, what was that gonzo shit, man?

543
00:29:06,664 --> 00:29:07,611
有次演唱赛中
So in a tournament,

544
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:08,775
有个家伙跟我狠狠地干了一架
I snap his arm

545
00:29:08,776 --> 00:29:10,186
直到打折他的手臂  他才服输
or he taps out

546
00:29:10,187 --> 00:29:11,515
双方都脸青鼻肿  像开了个紫酱铺
and we all go get burgers.

547
00:29:11,517 --> 00:29:13,083
-打折他的手臂  -得了
- Snap it. - Come on.

548
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:14,635
你看  枪搞到手了
Look, we've got the gun.

549
00:29:14,636 --> 00:29:15,475
为何不放过他...
Why don't we just let him...

550
00:29:15,476 --> 00:29:16,186
等等  我可不想拿着枪
Wait, wait. I don't want it.

551
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:17,855
明白不  这感觉...很糟
All right? I don't... I don't feel good with it.

552
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:19,156
谁要
Who wants it?

553
00:29:19,158 --> 00:29:20,090
-别给我  -哼

我站起身后  再给我
I'll take it when I'm up.

558
00:29:26,499 --> 00:29:27,731
当我放手时...
When I let go...

559
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:29,133
你会怎样

00:29:30,236 --> 00:29:31,769
操烂房间里每个人的屁眼
Butt-fuck everyone in the room.

561
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:35,940
给我像印度教徒一样坐好
You're gonna sit criss-cross applesauce.

没
No.

568
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,560
今天可给它们喂过食

569
00:29:56,562 --> 00:29:57,828
无关紧要

Like I said, they're pros.

574
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:05,669

00:36:52,945 --> 00:36:54,825
不担心他们会讲出去
You're not worried they'll talk?

697
00:36:55,614 --> 00:36:57,247
他们懂得轻重
They've got priorities.

698
00:37:01,153 --> 00:37:03,341
跟他们说假如能守口如瓶几天
Tell them the party is on

699
00:37:03,342 --> 00:37:04,688
参加派对免费
us if they hole up for a couple of days.

700
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:07,024
先把事情压下去再说
Put this fire out first.

701
00:37:07,026 --> 00:37:08,358
葛洛夫帮派呢?
Grove Street?

702
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,693
我已经吩咐供应毒品的手下
My dope nigger stamps in case

703
00:37:10,694 --> 00:37:12,129
这几天压货不卖
one of these meat-heads

704
00:37:12,131 --> 00:37:14,164
谨防这帮傻头傻脑的家伙因为藏毒罪被捕
gets booked for possession.

705
00:37:14,166 --> 00:37:16,233
好
All right.

706
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:18,368
想办法找个安全的地方
Let's get y'all somewhere safe.

707
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,616
下面有宝藏?
Treasure?

708
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:35,252
地板下  意味着光明
Daylight. Underneath.

709
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:39,656
外面的人在动我们的装备
They're moving our gear.

710
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,627
-喂  -各位
- Yes? - Gentlemen?

711
00:37:43,629 --> 00:37:45,562
现在就放你们出去
We're loading you out.

712
00:37:45,564 --> 00:37:47,531
警察来了吗
Are there cops here?

713
00:37:47,533 --> 00:37:50,734
事情有点复杂  警察来了又走了
They've come and gone. It got a little complicated.

714
00:37:50,736 --> 00:37:52,769
真倒了大霉
We're so fucked.

715
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:55,539
呃  我嗓音有些嘶哑
Uh, I'm getting hoarse.

716
00:37:55,541 --> 00:37:59,576
这个音量说话  你们能听清吗
Can you hear me if I speak at this volume?

717
00:37:59,578 --> 00:38:00,744
-能  -能的
- Yeah. - Yes.

718
00:38:00,746 --> 00:38:02,112
好
Good.

719
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:03,113
啊...
Um...

720
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:06,283
你们能一个人回答问题吗
and can we please elect just one voice?

721
00:38:10,089 --> 00:38:11,221
好
Yes.

722
00:38:11,223 --> 00:38:14,257
好  你们现在是困兽犹斗
Okay. Now, you're trapped.

723
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:16,059
这不是威胁  而是事实
That's not a threat. It's a fact.

724
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:18,095
哦  我们可有支装满子弹的枪
Well, we have a loaded gun.

725
00:38:18,097 --> 00:38:19,663
这也是事实
That's also just a fact.

726
00:38:19,665 --> 00:38:22,566
哦  我们手头的枪可多着呢
Oh, we have plenty more guns on hand.

727
00:38:22,568 --> 00:38:25,235
只是想请你们离开
We just want you out.

728
00:38:25,237 --> 00:38:26,570
不会伤害你们的
Not harmed.

729
00:38:27,606 --> 00:38:32,109
听我说  你们手持的武器并未注册
Now, the firearm you have is not registered.

730
00:38:32,111 --> 00:38:34,348
我只是想在当局赶到之前
I wanted it out of the picture

731
00:38:34,349 --> 00:38:36,179
把那武器处理掉
before the authorities arrived,

732
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:38,148
但你们拒绝合作  所以事情走到了这一步
but you refused, so here we are.

733
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,516
-胡扯  -对
- Bullshit. - Yeah.

734
00:38:39,518 --> 00:38:42,152
到了这一步
Here we are.

735
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:45,255
代我的手下跟你诚意道歉  他们慌了神
Oh, I do apologize for my associates. They panicked.

736
00:38:45,257 --> 00:38:47,103
对  没错  老兄  我们...
Yeah, no shit! Man, we're...

737
00:38:47,104 --> 00:38:47,657
听着  听着
Listen! Listen!

738
00:38:49,428 --> 00:38:51,695
没人想掩盖事实
No one is trying to wipe the slate clean.

739
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,519
我不再关心你们看到了什么
Whatever you saw or did

740
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,134
或是做了什么
is no longer my concern.

741
00:38:57,136 --> 00:38:59,336
想跟谁说  就跟谁说去
You tell whoever you want whatever you want.

742
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:03,740
只是想求得你的理解  关押你们在这儿
All I ask is that you understand you were held here

743
00:39:03,742 --> 00:39:07,711
只是为了安全起见  事态平息自会放人
for your own safety before you were released.

744
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,150
好
Okay.

745
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:16,486
好  谢谢你
Yes. Thank you.

746
00:39:16,488 --> 00:39:18,622
但事先...
But just...

747
00:39:18,624 --> 00:39:21,825
事先说清楚...
just to be clear...

748
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:23,426
警察会回来吗
the police are coming back?

749
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:25,295
警察来了又走了
They've come and gone.

750
00:39:25,297 --> 00:39:27,797
哦  老兄  这才是让我们担忧的
Well, that's what concerns us, man!

751
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:30,934
不过是想处理掉那把枪
I just want that gun out of the picture.

752
00:39:36,275 --> 00:39:37,607
好
Okay.

753
00:39:38,777 --> 00:39:41,178
-小心  -对不起
- Careful, man. - Sorry.

754
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,413
-我们该怎么办  -挖通该死的地板
- What do we do? - We dig through the fucking floor.

755
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:45,015
等在这儿行吗
While we just wait?

756
00:39:45,016 --> 00:39:46,023
外面的人随时会开枪攻击我们
They could shoot us at any time.

757
00:39:46,024 --> 00:39:46,616
是啊  但他们还没有
Yeah, but they haven't.

758
00:39:46,618 --> 00:39:48,251
又怎么知道外面那些人有枪
How do we even know that they have guns?

759
00:39:48,253 --> 00:39:50,353
毫无疑问  他们是有枪的
They have guns. No question.

760
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:51,821
怎么能信得过你?
We're gonna trust you?

761
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:55,725
-一点筹码都没有  -手机...
- We've got zero leverage. - Ask for a phone...

762
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:58,228
换枪
for the gun. All right.

763
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,339
他怎么办  -
What about him?

764
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,864
我是说  一旦我们开门
Yeah, I mean, the minute we give it up,

765
00:40:00,866 --> 00:40:02,258
他跳起来袭击咋办
what if he just, like, attacks?

766
00:40:02,259 --> 00:40:03,186
那就把他捆个结实
Then I'll wrap him up.

767
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,502
好
Okay.

768
00:40:05,504 --> 00:40:07,804
就看外面的人怎么想啦
So we see what they think? Mmhmm.

769
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:12,209
好
All right.

770
00:40:12,211 --> 00:40:17,447
我们给你枪  换个手机
Uh, we'll give you the gun for a cell phone.

771
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:18,882
抱歉  不行
Sorry, no.

772
00:40:18,884 --> 00:40:22,335
好吧  那换把注册了的武器呢
Okay, well, how about a registered firearm?

773
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:22,719
好笑
Funny.

774
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:25,355
贾斯汀  你在里面活着吗
Justin, you alive and well?

775
00:40:25,357 --> 00:40:27,857
-活得好好的  -好  那就好
- I'm alive. - Okay, good.

776
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:32,696
里面的各位  希望你们接受现实
Gentlemen, I hope you appreciate the situation.

777
00:40:32,698 --> 00:40:36,733
毫无疑问  事情的确失控了
Things have gone south, no doubt.

778
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:41,404
要知道  假如不把枪缴出来
But you know if you don't hand over that gun,

779
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:43,807
结局可大大不妙
it won't end well.

780
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:45,609
你瞧..
You see...

781
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:49,412
就我所知  我...过来打理生意
for all I know, I... I come to my place of business

782
00:40:49,414 --> 00:40:51,448
发现有外乡来的乐队
and there is an out of town band

783
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,950
反锁在房间里  手持未注册武器
locked in a room with an unregistered firearm.

784
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:56,519
-啊  得了  -而且里头还有人受伤
- Oh, come on! - And somebody's hurt inside there

785
00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:59,589
甚至挟持人质
and maybe there's a hostage, too!

786
00:41:00,926 --> 00:41:02,459
我还能怎么办
So what do I do?

787
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:07,230
是不是有权利干预呢
Am I within my rights to intervene?

788
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:09,866
是不是该踢开房门  直接开火呢
Should I kick down the door and start shooting?

789
00:41:09,868 --> 00:41:12,569
还是...
Or...

790
00:41:12,571 --> 00:41:16,873
把非法枪械从事态中撇开呢
can we just remove the guns from the equation?

791
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:18,975
这些是我的问题
These are my questions.

792
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:21,645
你们有30秒作答
You've got 30 seconds to answer.

793
00:41:21,647 --> 00:41:24,848
好说  等等  请等等
Okay, hold on. Hold on.

794
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:27,784
谁有更好的主意吗
Great. Anyone got any smart ideas?

795
00:41:27,786 --> 00:41:29,686
贾斯汀  趴在地板上
Justin, get on the floor.

796
00:41:31,723 --> 00:41:34,357
TMD趴在地板上  快点
Get on the fuckin' floor right now. Go.

797
00:41:36,795 --> 00:41:39,262
山姆  你过来
All right. Sam, come around here.

798
00:41:39,264 --> 00:41:41,798
-慢点  从我手里接过枪  -好
- Slowly, I want you to take the gun from me. - Okay.

799
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,680
-拿稳啦  -是的
- You got it? - Got it.

800
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:46,002
轻松愉快
Okay. Nice and easy.

801
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:48,305
你合作  就不让你太难过
Play nice, and I'll be nice.

802
00:41:48,307 --> 00:41:49,673
求你
Please.

803
00:41:49,675 --> 00:41:51,225
别乱来
Don't do anything.

804
00:41:51,226 --> 00:41:52,776
-这TMD太蠢的  -谁说不是呢
- This is fuckin' retarded. - No one's saying it isn't,

805
00:41:52,778 --> 00:41:55,345
要么缴枪  要么举枪开火
but we either hand over the gun or we open fire with it.

806
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:58,415
-我选开火  -你没资格  懂吗
- I vote for that. - You don't have a vote, okay?

807
00:41:58,417 --> 00:42:00,450
选哪条路都要冒大风险  所以...
I mean we're taking chances either way, so...

808
00:42:00,452 --> 00:42:01,685
这么说死定了
So we're fuckin' dead, guys.

809
00:42:01,687 --> 00:42:03,586
至少我发现  这样干
At least this way, we find out

810
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:05,789
大家支持的话  会争取些时间
if all we're doing now is buying time.

811
00:42:05,791 --> 00:42:07,290
-对他们而言  -阿门
- For them. - Amen.

812
00:42:07,292 --> 00:42:09,459
这个时候  我只是好奇
At this point, I'm just fucking curious.

813
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:17,767
好...给你枪
Okay... we'll give you the gun.

814
00:42:19,304 --> 00:42:21,604
但我们会留着子弹
But we're gonna keep the ammo.

815
00:42:21,606 --> 00:42:24,040
好说  为了所有人的安全起见
Fine. Safer for everyone.

816
00:42:25,477 --> 00:42:27,277
一起搬动那该死的沙发
All right, let's move this fucking couch.

817
00:42:27,279 --> 00:42:28,719
好
Okay.

818
00:42:40,826 --> 00:42:43,693
好好  别乱动
All right, keep still.

819
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:48,965
退后
Okay, stand back!

820
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:50,647
枪会给你
You've got it.

821
00:42:55,307 --> 00:42:56,840
来吧
Here we go.

822
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:06,316
可以上前吗
May I approach?

823
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:07,684
不行
No!

824
00:43:07,686 --> 00:43:09,686
不行  我会扔过去
No. I'm gonna throw it.

825
00:43:09,688 --> 00:43:12,122
小心  这枪可是别人送的礼物
Careful. It was a gift.

826
00:43:19,464 --> 00:43:20,997
-外面的人想做掉我们  -别扔枪
- They're killing us! - Keep the gun!

827
00:43:23,702 --> 00:43:25,602
TMD放开我
Get the fuck off of me!

828
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:28,037
喂  喂
Okay, okay!

829
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:30,473
喂  喂  喂  喂
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

830
00:43:38,917 --> 00:43:40,784
去你的
Fuck you!

831
00:43:42,387 --> 00:43:44,387
啊  我的天
Oh, my God!

832
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:46,055
别动  扎起来
Keep it up! Pull it up!

833
00:43:46,057 --> 00:43:47,557
我靠
Oh fuck.

834
00:43:49,361 --> 00:43:51,161
帮我一起移动那沙发
Yo, help me move the couch.

835
00:43:54,733 --> 00:43:55,632

各位  事情很快会过去的
This will be over soon, gentlemen.

838
00:44:09,748 --> 00:44:11,848
我要搞死你
I'll fuckin' crush you.

839
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,520
快抢开箱刀
Get the box cutter!

840
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:27,497
从他手中把开箱刀夺过来
Get the fucking box cutter out of his hand!

841
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:36,039
-晕过去了就跟我讲  -好

Pat! Pat!

843
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:39,709
看着我  看着我  看着我
Look at me, look at me, look at me.

844
00:44:39,711 --> 00:44:40,910
嘘嘘  嘘嘘
Shush! Shush!

845
00:44:40,912 --> 00:44:42,078
安静
Shush!

846
00:44:43,582 --> 00:44:45,882
晕过去了  他晕过去了
He's out. He's out!

847
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,854
我靠
Oh, fuck.

848
00:44:50,856 --> 00:44:54,057
压住伤口  快压住伤口
Put pressure on it! Put pressure!

849
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:55,592
我懂  我懂
I know, I know, I know.

850
00:44:55,594 --> 00:44:57,861
深呼吸  深呼吸  深呼吸
Just breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

851
00:44:57,863 --> 00:45:00,163
没晕
He's not out!

852
00:45:00,165 --> 00:45:01,197
还没晕
He's not out!

853
00:45:04,135 --> 00:45:05,668
明白啦
You got this?

854
00:45:26,525 --> 00:45:28,558
要多久才会...
How long does it take...

855
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,628
直到确认...真的?
until we know... for sure?

856
00:45:35,534 --> 00:45:37,667
搞什么...
What the...

857
00:45:37,669 --> 00:45:38,735
啊  天呐
Oh, Jesus.

858
00:45:43,642 --> 00:45:44,974
啊  天呐
Oh, Jesus.

859
00:45:54,753 --> 00:45:56,719
收起所有武器
Any and all firearms,

860
00:45:56,721 --> 00:45:58,922
克拉克从现在开始接管这事
Clark will handle it from here on.

861
00:45:58,924 --> 00:46:00,523
他有跟你说多久完事吗
He give you an E.T.A.?

862
00:46:00,525 --> 00:46:02,158
你说不能带手机
You said no calls.

863
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,860
好  很好
Right. Good.

864
00:46:03,862 --> 00:46:05,528
-手机也缴出来  -里头发生了什么
-Phones too. -What happened in there?

865
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:07,330
安排尼尔明天过来
Set Neal up for tomorrow

866
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:08,306
换上新的隔墙  粉刷地板
New drywall, pour a floor.

867
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,131
就跟他说漏水弄成这样
Tell him we had a leak.

868
00:46:09,134 --> 00:46:11,534
-门框也得换过  -怎么回事
-Door with a frame, too. -What happened?

869
00:46:11,536 --> 00:46:13,870
今晚发生了一起大骚动
Uh, a bit of a maelstrom tonight.

870
00:46:13,872 --> 00:46:16,639
来访乐队伤了我们的人
Visiting band hurt one of ours.

871
00:46:16,641 --> 00:46:17,874
谁
Who?

872
00:46:17,876 --> 00:46:19,576
艾米莉
Emily.

873
00:46:19,578 --> 00:46:21,511
也许还有大个贾斯汀
Maybe Big Justin, too.

874
00:46:21,513 --> 00:46:22,645
那还干等着做什么
What the fuck are we doing then?

875
00:46:22,647 --> 00:46:24,714
赶紧进去啊
Let's get in there.

876
00:46:24,716 --> 00:46:28,518
各行各事可不行
We're not coming apart is what we are doing.

877
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:33,556
这事没处理完之前  少TMD的问问题
We're saving questions until this pig fuck is transferred off-site.

878
00:46:33,558 --> 00:46:36,059
达西
Darcy.

879
00:46:36,061 --> 00:46:40,129
最后机会  谁想撒泡尿赶紧去
Okay. Last chance if anyone needs to take a leak.

880
00:47:12,564 --> 00:47:14,564
我弄丢了枪
I lost the gun.

881
00:47:14,566 --> 00:47:17,166
换是我  坚持不了那么久
You held on longer than I would have.

882
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:22,605
嘿
Hey.

883
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:24,140
我要走出去
I'm going.

884
00:47:24,142 --> 00:47:28,244
这儿没换气装置  没下水系统...
There's no air shaft, there's no sewer system...

885
00:47:28,246 --> 00:47:30,680
啥都没有
no nothing.

886
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:33,490
看这儿
There it is.

887
00:47:37,889 --> 00:47:39,188
现在什么时间
What time is it?

888
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,690
反正不是白天
It's not daylight.

889
00:47:40,692 --> 00:47:42,191
有点进展就好
It's something.

890
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:43,893
让开路
Out the way.

891
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:12,422
哦  靠
Oh, fuck.

892
00:48:14,826 --> 00:48:16,459
找找看哪里有门
Look for a door.

893
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,480
有发现通知我
Just let me know.

894
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:26,770
嘿...
Hey...

895
00:48:28,173 --> 00:48:31,708
你朋友的事  真令人遗憾
I'm sorry about your friend.

896
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:39,182
靠
Shit!

897
00:48:42,153 --> 00:48:43,920
让开
Okay, move.

898
00:48:43,922 --> 00:48:45,402
我操
Fuck!

899
00:48:57,969 --> 00:48:59,168
锁住了吗
Is there a lock?

900
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:02,071
也许外面上着锁
Other side, maybe.

901
00:49:02,073 --> 00:49:04,073
白费时间
We're burning time.

902
00:49:04,075 --> 00:49:05,308
等等  ...
Wait, but...

903
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:07,343
看  这有...换气槽
Look! There's... there's ventilation!

904
00:49:07,345 --> 00:49:08,878
舱口才六英寸  好彩你上
Six inch ducts. Good luck.

905
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,680
再四处找找
Shouldn't we look around more?

906
00:49:10,682 --> 00:49:12,048
都找过了
We just did!

907
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:14,383
上  上  上  用力推
Go. Go, go. Push.

908
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:24,060
海洛因
Heroin.

909
00:49:24,062 --> 00:49:28,064
跟地上的她或我们都无关
It's not about her or us.

910
00:49:30,869 --> 00:49:32,769
好大个的...地下暗仓
It's a... it's a big ass bunker.

911
00:49:32,771 --> 00:49:34,470
-帮把手  -坑爹的死胡同
- Give me your hand. - Big ass dead end.

912
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:35,972
手给我  稳  稳  稳住
Give it to me. Hold it up, up, up.

913
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:37,306
好啦  别看  别看
All right. Look away, look away.

914
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:38,808
也许可以用地堡做点什么
Maybe we can use this to our advantage.

915
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:40,410
死定了
We're done.

916
00:49:41,146 --> 00:49:43,680
不想再等
I'm done.

917
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:45,505
-明白吗  -想实践你的想法冲出去
-Okay? -You can close the door behind me

918
00:49:45,506 --> 00:49:46,215
别忘记关好门
if you want to strategize.

919
00:49:46,217 --> 00:49:47,321
还没准备好
We're not ready!

920
00:49:47,322 --> 00:49:48,918
你以为外面那些人在忙些什么
What do you think they're doing out there?

921
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,369
怎么啦  大家都不清楚
That's just it. We don't know.

922
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:50,853
大家都清楚
We fucking know

923
00:49:50,855 --> 00:49:52,255
一心想弄死我们
they mean us harm!

924
00:49:52,257 --> 00:49:54,257
就不知道他们有没有枪
It's just that if have guns,

925
00:49:54,259 --> 00:49:56,058
那为啥还没冲进来割掉我们脑袋
okay, why haven't they mowed us down already?

926
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:58,060
不能让我们无缘无故失踪
We can't just go missing.

927
00:49:58,062 --> 00:49:59,729
他们想布置现场让我们的尸体被找到
They need us found.

928
00:49:59,731 --> 00:50:01,497
好吧  随手拿点什么
All right. Grab some shit

929
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:02,498
准备夺路狂奔
and get ready to run.

930
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,866
冲出去找死
Then we die.

931
00:50:03,868 --> 00:50:05,968
再等下去
Yeah, but the longer we wait,

932
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:07,470
肯定会死的
the surer that is.

933
00:50:09,307 --> 00:50:10,486
泰格  准备好没
Tiger, you ready?

934
00:50:10,487 --> 00:50:11,174
好  差不多了
Yeah, almost, man.

935
00:50:11,176 --> 00:50:14,577
大家该不是认真的吧
We can't take it so seriously.

936
00:50:17,882 --> 00:50:20,750
我们得...
We gotta...

937
00:50:20,752 --> 00:50:24,153
把这看作是漆弹游戏
treat this like paintball.

938
00:50:25,957 --> 00:50:26,989
啥
What?

939
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,359
瑞克・席尔瓦...
Rick Silva...

940
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:35,112
在溜冰场单身派对
helped organize the paintball

941
00:50:35,113 --> 00:50:37,900
组织了一场漆弹枪比赛
for Skate-o's bachelor party.

942
00:50:37,902 --> 00:50:42,138
打全场  我们少了几名队员
And we were short a few players to book the whole field,

943
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:47,810
于是人们安排我们队跟几个前陆战队员对赛
so they paired us up with these ex-Marines.

944
00:50:47,812 --> 00:50:49,095
前几个回合
And the first few rounds,

945
00:50:49,096 --> 00:50:51,480
那些前陆战队员把我们...
these guys just...

946
00:50:51,482 --> 00:50:54,984
杀得落花流水
tore us to shreds.

947
00:50:54,986 --> 00:50:58,187
我是说  对方无一中弹
I mean, zero casualties on their side.

948
00:50:58,189 --> 00:51:01,290
而我一动不动卧倒在树后面躲藏
And I just cowered behind these trees

949
00:51:01,292 --> 00:51:03,259
还是中了枪
till I got shot.

950
00:51:03,261 --> 00:51:05,561
身上布满彩漆  但瑞克...
Covered in paint. But Rick...

951
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:07,463
泰格  弄完了没有
Tiger, you done?

952
00:51:09,801 --> 00:51:11,500
好了
Okay.

953
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:13,002
帕特  你也别说啦
Pat, you're done, too.

954
00:51:13,004 --> 00:51:14,403
兄弟  抱歉  我们得走了
I'm sorry, man. We gotta go.

955
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,072
没事
That's okay.

956
00:51:16,074 --> 00:51:18,107
-这算是帮我们打气吗  -预备
- Was that a pep talk? - Ready?

957
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,080
也许不能每个人都活着冲出去  但...
Now we won't all live, but...

958
00:51:25,516 --> 00:51:27,617
怎么说呢  至少不用大家都死掉
I don't know. Maybe we won't all die.

959
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:35,858
-给  -不用  我尽力跑就行
- Here. - No, I'm just gonna run.

960
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,420
好吧
I got it.

961
00:51:39,063 --> 00:51:42,198
好啦  操他妹的  西蒙和加芬克尔
All right, fuck it. Simon and Garfunkel.

962
00:51:44,335 --> 00:51:46,135
荒岛乐园
Desert island band.

963
00:51:48,306 --> 00:51:49,538
普林斯
Prince.

964
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:53,910
我...
I, uh...

965
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:56,706
我还有点昏头昏脑
I'm still the Misfits.

966
00:51:56,707 --> 00:51:57,480
老兄  振作点
True school, man.

967
00:51:57,482 --> 00:51:59,115
一起出去?
Are we going?

968
00:52:01,219 --> 00:52:02,659
对
Yeah.

969
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:13,095
麦当娜和...杀手乐队
Madonna and... Slayer.

970
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:17,300
来吧
Here we go.

971
00:52:17,302 --> 00:52:18,401
当心
Watch it!

972
00:52:22,006 --> 00:52:23,339
咋回事
What the fuck?

973
00:52:24,876 --> 00:52:26,175
放我们离开不成
They're letting us out.

974
00:52:26,177 --> 00:52:27,410
这场子有多少个出口
How many exits are there?

975
00:52:27,412 --> 00:52:30,313
前大门  后门  大概厨房还有个门
Uh, the main, the back, maybe the kitchen.

976
00:52:30,315 --> 00:52:31,647
-我总是... -窗户呢
-I always... -What about windows?

977
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:33,082
自个去找
See for yourselves.

978
00:52:34,585 --> 00:52:35,651
靠
Fuck.

979
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:36,986
安静
Quiet.

980
00:52:39,924 --> 00:52:41,424
见鬼
Oh, shit.

981
00:52:41,426 --> 00:52:43,259
要不躲起来
Should we hide?

982
00:52:43,261 --> 00:52:45,328
兄弟  爱怎么干是你的事
Uh, whatever you want, man.

983
00:52:53,237 --> 00:52:54,971
我们...应该分头行事
We... we should split up.

984
00:52:54,973 --> 00:52:56,439
完全同意
Totally.

985
00:53:05,616 --> 00:53:07,483
他妈的
What the fuck?

986
00:53:07,485 --> 00:53:09,051
泰格
Tiger!

987
00:53:11,556 --> 00:53:14,190
泰格
Tiger!

988
00:53:18,363 --> 00:53:19,595
啊  糟  糟了
Oh, shit, oh, shit.

989
00:53:24,402 --> 00:53:25,568
糟糕
Shit.

990
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,140
不好
Oh, shit!

991
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:36,612
停手
Save it.

992
00:53:36,614 --> 00:53:38,681
啊  我靠
Oh, shit.

993
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:18,120
咬  咬
Fass! Fass!

994
00:54:19,524 --> 00:54:21,724
四处找找  咬
Voran! Fass!

995
00:54:21,726 --> 00:54:23,059
咬
Fass!

996
00:55:06,504 --> 00:55:07,736
嘿
Hey.

997
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:24,620
到处都是他们的人
They're everywhere!

998
00:55:24,622 --> 00:55:26,422
里斯在哪儿
Where's Reece?

999
00:55:28,726 --> 00:55:30,246
就剩下我们几个
It's us.

1000
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,234
快  搬过去
Come on. Move.

1001
00:55:40,438 --> 00:55:41,670
山姆  你看
Sam, look.

1002
00:55:45,476 --> 00:55:46,775
生食之狼
Fleisch Wolf.

1003
00:55:46,777 --> 00:55:48,511
是首歌
It's a song.

1004
00:55:50,081 --> 00:55:51,814
意思是"绞肉机"
It means "Meat Grinder."

1005
00:55:53,718 --> 00:55:55,818
上  上
Up! Up!

1006
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:57,786
真勇敢
So ist's brav.

1007
00:55:57,788 --> 00:55:59,288
真勇敢
So ist's brav.

1008
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:01,123
这么快就不行啦
You're retiring him?

1009
00:56:01,125 --> 00:56:03,159
它精疲力尽了
He's worked up.

1010
00:56:03,161 --> 00:56:04,426
派哪一条狗去
Send in another.

1011
00:56:04,428 --> 00:56:05,528
派两条  了结这事
Send two. Finish it.

1012
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:07,630
把场子里那回音系统搞掉
Kill that feedback first.

1013
00:56:07,632 --> 00:56:09,163
不然送两条狗进去
And if I send in two fight dogs,

1014
00:56:09,164 --> 00:56:10,866
里面的人会故伎重演
what do you think they'll do?

1015
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:12,835
让我进去  了结他们
Send me in there. I'll finish up.

1016
00:56:12,837 --> 00:56:14,436
告诉我要注意什么
Just give me the rules.

1017
00:56:14,438 --> 00:56:15,804
好不
All right.

1018
00:56:17,808 --> 00:56:19,675
只能用刀
Blades only.

1019
00:56:19,677 --> 00:56:21,677
砍得稀烂就好
Sloppy is fine.

1020
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:22,711
别深至见骨
Try not to hit the bone.

1021
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:24,446
好
Okay.

1022
00:56:24,448 --> 00:56:26,115
带上乔纳森
Take Jonathan.

1023
00:56:26,117 --> 00:56:27,483
残暴二人组
Brute squad.

1024
00:56:27,485 --> 00:56:29,365
关好狗  我俩出来前别放出来
Keep him caged until we tag out.

1025
00:56:33,224 --> 00:56:34,890
还有气儿?
He breathing?

1026
00:56:41,566 --> 00:56:43,399
有点气  对
A little bit, yeah.

1027
00:56:43,401 --> 00:56:45,634
让他流血
Let him bleed.

1028
00:56:45,636 --> 00:56:48,571
死亡时间越晚越好
Later is better for time of death.

1029
00:56:48,573 --> 00:56:49,672
钥匙呢
Keys?

1030
00:56:49,674 --> 00:56:51,640
没
No.

1031
00:57:23,908 --> 00:57:25,708
他们进来了
They're coming.

1032
00:57:28,246 --> 00:57:29,778
我好怕
I can't do this.

1033
00:57:36,387 --> 00:57:37,786
退后
Get back!

1034
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:39,922
不
No!

1035
00:57:39,924 --> 00:57:41,390
艾米莉在哪儿
Where's Emily?

1036
00:57:47,498 --> 00:57:49,898
你想做什么
What the fuck are you doing?

1037
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,367
喂
Hey!

1038
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:55,371
谁干的
Which one did it?

1039
00:57:55,373 --> 00:57:56,872
-乌姆干的  -胡扯
- Werm did it. - Bullshit.

1040
00:57:56,874 --> 00:57:57,973
谁干的
Which one?

1041
00:57:57,975 --> 00:57:59,875
他们怎么跟你说的
What did they tell you?

1042
00:58:01,345 --> 00:58:03,746
啥  想不想知道真相
What? You want to know?

1043
00:58:03,748 --> 00:58:06,448
想让他也知道吗
You want him to know?

1044
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:07,850
知道什么
Know what?

1045
00:58:07,852 --> 00:58:11,620
乌姆发现她打算离去...
Werm found out that she was leaving...

1046
00:58:11,622 --> 00:58:14,690
但她没提及跟你一起走
but she didn't say that it was with you.

1047
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:17,993
"绞肉机"
"Meat Grinder."

1048
00:58:19,897 --> 00:58:22,831
这首歌其实是他们给的绝杀令
That song was their cue.

1049
00:58:24,402 --> 00:58:25,768
你走吧
You should go.

1050
00:58:35,513 --> 00:58:37,113
来吧
Here we go.

1051
00:58:38,382 --> 00:58:39,948
花太久时间了
This is taking too long.

1052
00:58:42,386 --> 00:58:43,719
盖比
Gabe?

1053
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:48,957
你没让丹尼尔看门
You didn't want Daniel on door duty.

1054
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:50,426
咋啦
Why?

1055
00:58:51,696 --> 00:58:54,963
他和艾米莉的事...
Nothing concrete, he and...

1056
00:58:54,965 --> 00:58:56,899
没确凿证据...
and Emily...

1057
00:59:27,498 --> 00:59:29,598
一对鸳鸯鸟
Little lovebirds.

1058
00:59:50,955 --> 00:59:52,454
认出这个没有
Recognize this?

1059
00:59:54,358 --> 00:59:55,357
认不出
No, sir.

1060
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:57,059
当然认不出  这帮小伙子累死累活
Of course not. You were still handing out

1061
00:59:57,061 --> 00:59:59,595
你只是站门口派派传单
leaflets when these boys made their bones.

1062
00:59:59,597 --> 01:00:01,463
去年复活节的事情
It's from last Easter.

1063
01:00:01,465 --> 01:00:04,933
地下乐队集会后  这东西本该消失的
Supposed to disappear after the boot party.

1064
01:00:06,036 --> 01:00:07,803
他一进去就讲个不停
He just started talking.

1065
01:00:07,805 --> 01:00:09,571
安珀还活着  说艾米莉是乌姆杀的
Amber's alive saying Werm did it.

1066
01:00:09,573 --> 01:00:10,672
不必在意
Never mind that.

1067
01:00:10,674 --> 01:00:12,641
你呀...
You...

1068
01:00:14,812 --> 01:00:18,680
乌姆救了我们所有人
Werm saved us all.

1069
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:27,790
山姆
Sam?

1070
01:00:30,661 --> 01:00:32,694
没事
It's okay.

1071
01:00:32,696 --> 01:00:36,365
我是说  情形是不好
I mean, it's not okay.

1072
01:00:36,367 --> 01:00:38,867
-你也不知道  -他跟我们一伙
- You didn't know either? - He's with us.

1073
01:00:38,869 --> 01:00:39,968
不是那儿
Not where.

1074
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,610
得分头出去
We gotta split.

1075
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:48,877
我觉得这风道尺寸要大些
This has a wider duct, I think.

1076
01:00:48,879 --> 01:00:51,814
钻不进去的
We're not gonna fit through there.

1077
01:00:51,816 --> 01:00:53,515
啊
Oh!

1078
01:00:53,517 --> 01:00:56,018
丹尼尔  他能帮上忙
Daniel, um, he can help.

1079
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:57,419
什么
Why?

1080
01:00:57,421 --> 01:00:59,021
他是谁
Who's he?

1081
01:00:59,023 --> 01:00:59,682
变节者
A traitor.

1082
01:00:59,683 --> 01:01:01,924
就算他们以前不知道  现在也明白了
If they don't already know, they know now.

1083
01:01:01,926 --> 01:01:03,625
我能带大家出去
I can get us out of here.

1084
01:01:03,627 --> 01:01:05,561
哇  阴谋调调
Wow. A conspiracy.

1085
01:01:05,563 --> 01:01:07,563
不对  千头万绪说不清
No, just a cluster-fuck.

1086
01:01:14,505 --> 01:01:17,573
这儿有匕首和砍刀  专门招待里面的客人
There is still blades and fangs for the visitors,

1087
01:01:17,575 --> 01:01:19,675
但时间有点紧迫
but we are getting lean on time.

1088
01:01:19,677 --> 01:01:22,744
万一要开枪  开一次就好
Now, if you have to shoot, shoot once.

1089
01:01:22,746 --> 01:01:24,980
不得不开几枪的话  那就连发
If more than once, keep it a tight grouping

1090
01:01:24,982 --> 01:01:27,416
因为你们得把尸体里的弹头挖出来
'cause you'll be digging the slugs out yourself.

1091
01:01:27,418 --> 01:01:29,378
至于丹尼尔和安珀  可以对他们...
As for Daniel and Amber, they can...

1092
01:01:34,625 --> 01:01:36,258
忘了什么来着
What did we forget?

1093
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:48,014
从大门出去走任何一边都可以去到河边
There's a river on two sides.

1094
01:01:48,015 --> 01:01:49,004
反方向是个采石场
The quarry's on another.

1095
01:01:49,006 --> 01:01:52,140
我们可以沿着大道的方向走  找人帮忙
We can parallel the main road back, go for help.

1096
01:01:52,142 --> 01:01:54,142
好  那怎么出这扇大门
Well, how do we get past the door?

1097
01:01:54,144 --> 01:01:55,878
我了解很多你所不知道的事情
I know something you don't.

1098
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,679
好  比如?
Good. What?

1099
01:01:57,681 --> 01:01:59,515
我知道那儿藏有...
I know where we keep...

1100
01:02:01,085 --> 01:02:02,651
手太慢
Too slow.

1101
01:02:37,187 --> 01:02:39,154
能走了吗
Should we go?

1102
01:02:39,156 --> 01:02:40,656
现在么
Now?

1103
01:02:40,658 --> 01:02:42,124
手头有枪啦
We have the gun.

1104
01:02:42,126 --> 01:02:43,992
应该行
I guess.

1105
01:02:43,994 --> 01:02:45,527
好
Yes.

1106
01:02:45,529 --> 01:02:46,895
好
Yes!

1107
01:02:46,897 --> 01:02:48,997
给我两发子弹
Give me two.

1108
01:03:11,522 --> 01:03:13,522
别乱来  不要对安珀开枪
Easy! Not her!

1109
01:03:13,524 --> 01:03:15,123
停火
Don't fire!

1110
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:16,224
咬  咬
Fass! Fass!

1111
01:03:16,226 --> 01:03:17,259
咬
Fass!

1112
01:03:18,829 --> 01:03:19,962
快滚
Go!

1113
01:03:19,964 --> 01:03:21,096
山姆
Sam!

1114
01:03:22,199 --> 01:03:23,265
山姆
Sam!

1115
01:03:32,743 --> 01:03:34,977
永远出不去的
We're never getting out.

1116
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:41,817
靠
Fuck.

1117
01:04:03,907 --> 01:04:06,174
要知道  我还算走运
You know, I'm lucky.

1118
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:09,344
还以为他们会对我开枪
I guessed at least they were gonna shoot me.

1119
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:22,057
各位  三个外来者尸体就行
Three'll do, gentlemen.

1120
01:04:22,059 --> 01:04:23,625
第四个可以让他消失
The fourth can disappear.

1121
01:04:23,627 --> 01:04:25,060
是时候清理现场啦
It's time to start the clean-up.

1122
01:04:25,062 --> 01:04:27,629
需要个推帚才行
I'm gonna need a push broom.

1123
01:04:27,631 --> 01:04:30,599
这一切本该早就结束的
This is supposed to have happened already.

1124
01:04:30,601 --> 01:04:32,441
-是时候加把劲了  -好的  先生
- Time to sprint. - Yes, sir.

1125
01:04:33,737 --> 01:04:35,337
干得好
Well done.

1126
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:37,439
该谢它才对
Thank him.

1127
01:04:39,743 --> 01:04:43,378
差点就从我  不  我们身边跑了
Nearly got away from me. Us.

1128
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:51,353
不是该惊惶不安吗
Shouldn't we be panicking?

1129
01:04:55,626 --> 01:04:57,325
肚子有点饿
I'm hungry.

1130
01:05:04,835 --> 01:05:07,936
不想跟你死一块儿
I can't die here with you.

1131
01:05:09,673 --> 01:05:11,339
那就别死
So don't.

1132
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:16,945
你懂的  有什么尽管...
You know, feel free just to...

1133
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:23,852
你那个鼓动人心的故事  剩下部分跟我讲讲
Hey, I want the rest of your pep talk.

1134
01:05:25,355 --> 01:05:28,090
噢  没心情再讲
Oh, no. It no longer applies.

1135
01:05:28,092 --> 01:05:30,358
得了
Oh, come on.

1136
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,461
好奇而已
I'm curious.

1137
01:05:33,897 --> 01:05:36,932
漆弹枪大战...
It was paintballing...

1138
01:05:36,934 --> 01:05:39,267
你躲在...
you were cowering...

1139
01:05:42,139 --> 01:05:44,272
对  瑞克・席尔瓦
Yeah, Rick Silva.

1140
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:50,202
我们被这些伊拉克荣誉退伍军人
We were getting slaughtered

1141
01:05:50,203 --> 01:05:51,913
杀得落花流水
by these legit Iraq vets.

1142
01:05:51,915 --> 01:05:53,782
情理之中
It totally applies.

1143
01:05:53,784 --> 01:05:59,087
价值上千美元的漆弹枪  装满弹药
Full camo, thousand-dollar automatic paintball guns.

1144
01:06:00,691 --> 01:06:02,667
对手经历过真实战争
They knew real war

1145
01:06:02,668 --> 01:06:05,961
也是按真实战争的方式来玩的
and they played real war.

1146
01:06:05,963 --> 01:06:11,199
战术  军事手语  包抄
Tactics, hand signals, flanking.

1147
01:06:11,201 --> 01:06:15,237
把我们杀个一干二净
Just wiped us all out.

1148
01:06:17,975 --> 01:06:22,377
瑞克忍无可忍  他说"去他妈的"
So Rick gets fed up and says, "Fuck it."

1149
01:06:22,379 --> 01:06:25,914
不在意是否中枪
Didn't care about getting shot.

1150
01:06:25,916 --> 01:06:28,984
不在意寻找掩护
Didn't care about taking cover.

1151
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:32,020
他真的是绝望透顶
It was hopeless, man.

1152
01:06:34,491 --> 01:06:40,061
最后一场  哨声响起时
So the last match, the whistle blows,

1153
01:06:40,063 --> 01:06:44,232
他直接冲了过去
and he just tears out there,

1154
01:06:44,234 --> 01:06:49,046
穿着截短裤  踩着胶底鞋...
full jackass, in...

1155
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:50,972
像个傻蛋一般
in sneakers and cut-offs

1156
01:06:50,974 --> 01:06:55,343
把...对手整个队伍杀个精光
and he... wipes out their whole team.

1157
01:06:57,014 --> 01:06:59,748
一刻不停
Doesn't stop.

1158
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:06,121
奔跑着  狂笑着  不停地射击...
Just keeps running and laughing and shooting...

1159
01:07:08,225 --> 01:07:10,892
直到对手全部中弹身亡
until they're all dead.

1160
01:07:14,431 --> 01:07:16,364
假装身亡吧
Pretend dead.

1161
01:07:17,801 --> 01:07:20,969
我俩现在面对的可是真枪
And we're up against real guns.

1162
01:07:20,971 --> 01:07:22,404
对
Yeah.

1163
01:07:24,875 --> 01:07:29,344
不管怎么说  真枪实弹我俩打不赢
Either way, we can't play real war.

1164
01:07:55,505 --> 01:07:57,439
那就假装好了
Let's pretend.

1165
01:08:14,491 --> 01:08:15,624
给你的
For you.

1166
01:08:19,963 --> 01:08:21,897
活该你干这些事
You already earned these.

1167
01:08:25,502 --> 01:08:28,503
烂摊子太难收拾的话  催催尼尔
Maybe push Neal, depending on the mess,

1168
01:08:28,505 --> 01:08:30,405
找个新的主场乐队
to start looking for a new house band.

1169
01:08:30,407 --> 01:08:33,174
要早点回归正轨才行
We've really gotta get back to a routine.

1170
01:08:33,176 --> 01:08:35,143
你觉得奶牛捕手乐队会讲出去吗
You think Cowcatcher's gonna talk?

1171
01:08:35,145 --> 01:08:38,013
更担心的是手下那些坏习惯
I'm more worried about their habits.

1172
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:41,583
真该让他们远离毒贩才行
Really have to stay away from that nigger dope.

1173
01:08:41,585 --> 01:08:44,586
近来道上有批次等货在流传
There's a bad batch doing the rounds.

1174
01:08:53,931 --> 01:08:55,397
可以上路了
We're good to go.

1175
01:08:58,502 --> 01:09:01,103
准备完毕
We're set.

1176
01:09:01,104 --> 01:09:04,064
就当这些事情从未在眼前发生过
This all hinges on nothing having happened here.

1177
01:09:06,243 --> 01:09:07,283
你们可听清楚了
Now, let's be clear.

1178
01:09:11,014 --> 01:09:12,647
这一针会让它多活上一个钟头
This should keep him alive for another hour.

1179
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:14,916
好心帮它个忙
I would consider it a personal favor

1180
01:09:14,918 --> 01:09:16,838
让这狗咬着别人的筋肉死去
if he dies with meat in his teeth.

1181
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:21,423
来吧  来吧
Come on. Come on.

1182
01:09:24,528 --> 01:09:26,194
撕咬的命令是"法斯"
Bite command is "fass."

1183
01:09:27,631 --> 01:09:29,264
说这个词就行
It's all you'll need.

1184
01:09:36,473 --> 01:09:39,941
不计代价  里面剩下的人开枪干掉就行
Disregard. Just shoot who is left.

1185
01:09:39,943 --> 01:09:41,676
他们不计数在布置的现场内
They don't have to be accounted for.

1186
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:44,312
不用操心犯罪现场鉴定的事情
Forensics is no longer a concern.

1187
01:09:46,183 --> 01:09:49,351
再拖下去  今晚的努力就泡汤了
We call this in late, all is for naught.

1188
01:09:54,424 --> 01:09:55,924
12号弹的霰弹枪  还有吗
You guys got any 12 gauge?

1189
01:09:55,926 --> 01:09:57,993
办公室没有  就去吧台找找
Not in the office. Try the bar.

1190
01:09:57,995 --> 01:10:00,128
-还剩下多少发子弹  -三发
- How many shots you have left? - Three.

1191
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:01,329
还剩一发备用
So you have one extra.

1192
01:10:15,645 --> 01:10:17,212
没筒壳弹
No shells.

1193
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:23,411
吧台后面  先去找找
Behind the bar. Better get started.

1194
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:38,033
见鬼
Shit!

1195
01:10:39,336 --> 01:10:41,016
放松  放松
Easy! Easy!

1196
01:10:43,306 --> 01:10:44,506
别急
Easy!

1197
01:10:44,508 --> 01:10:46,308
别在这儿用鹿弹
No buckshot!

1198
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:08,997
怎么回事
What's happening?

1199
01:11:08,999 --> 01:11:11,032
狗被吓着了  关掉这破玩意
Dog freaked. And turn this shit off!

1200
01:11:11,034 --> 01:11:12,734
试过  不是吧台那里的混音器发出的
I tried! It's not coming from our mixer.

1201
01:11:12,736 --> 01:11:14,369
你走  我们来处理
Go! We got this.

1202
01:11:14,371 --> 01:11:17,138
别告诉达西  或是克拉克
And don't tell Darcy. Or Clark.

1203
01:11:21,011 --> 01:11:22,571
-进去吗  -对
-We going? -Yeah.

1204
01:11:24,414 --> 01:11:26,464
嘿
Hey!

1205
01:11:26,465 --> 01:11:26,910
下来啊
Down there,

1206
01:11:26,911 --> 01:11:28,515
你这屎蛋赶时髦的朋克  狗娘养的小丑
you dip-shit fashion punk clown motherfuckers!

1207
01:11:28,518 --> 01:11:30,085
-转过身来  -猎头机器人
- Turn around! - Shazbot!

1208
01:11:30,087 --> 01:11:32,120
啥  什么...你说的是啥
What? What... Who is that?

1209
01:11:32,122 --> 01:11:34,122
奥丁亲自现身
Odin himself.

1210
01:12:01,418 --> 01:12:02,784
霰弹枪给我
Give me the shotgun.

1211
01:12:02,786 --> 01:12:04,285
不行  霰弹枪我拿着
No, I got the shotgun.

1212
01:12:04,287 --> 01:12:06,721
那你下这鬼地方去
Then you go down this fucking hole.

1213
01:12:09,292 --> 01:12:10,391
三发弹药
Three shots?

1214
01:12:10,393 --> 01:12:12,377
对
Yeah.

1215
01:12:12,378 --> 01:12:13,154
一听到两声枪响后
You hear me fire twice,

1216
01:12:13,155 --> 01:12:14,362
不管发生什么  冲下来找我
you come down no matter what.

1217
01:12:14,364 --> 01:12:16,364
-这是个圈套  -对  可不是嘛
- This is a trap. - Yeah, no shit.

1218
01:12:16,366 --> 01:12:17,632
要不你跟达西讲去
You wanna go tell Darcy?

1219
01:12:23,106 --> 01:12:24,806
他会气疯的
He's gonna be pissed.

1220
01:12:28,578 --> 01:12:30,445
看住后路
Watch my back.

1221
01:12:55,505 --> 01:12:57,238
去他娘的
Fuck this.

1222
01:12:59,409 --> 01:13:00,842
兄弟  快叫盖比
Get Gabe, man!

1223
01:13:00,844 --> 01:13:02,610
至少需要两个人在下面  一个守住上面
We need two down here and one up there.

1224
01:13:02,612 --> 01:13:03,686
九毫米手枪在谁手里
Who's got the nine?

1225
01:13:03,687 --> 01:13:05,346
我觉得在艾伦手里  不太确定...
I think Alan does, but I'm not sure-

1226
01:13:05,348 --> 01:13:07,849
啊  我靠  被挡住了
Oh, fuck! Block it!

1227
01:13:09,553 --> 01:13:11,033
帕特
Pat!

1228
01:13:12,222 --> 01:13:13,688
他就三发弹药
He's got three shots left!

1229
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:15,223
婊子
Bitch.

1230
01:13:25,602 --> 01:13:27,302
盖比

1233

还剩两发
Two shots left!

1236
01:14:01,504 --> 01:14:03,338
试探得好
Nice fuckin' try!

1237
01:14:05,642 --> 01:14:07,342
操你自己吧
Go fuck yourself!

1238
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:15,750
靠  靠
Shit. Shit.

1239
01:14:40,343 --> 01:14:41,576

01:14:52,789 --> 01:14:54,355

01:15:01,564 --> 01:15:03,531
没弹药
Zero.

1244
01:15:10,707 --> 01:15:11,707
啊  我靠
Oh, shit!

1245
01:15:17,681 --> 01:15:19,047
放开我
Get off of me!

1246
01:15:56,319 --> 01:15:57,652
搞定他了
Got him.

1247
01:15:59,656 --> 01:16:01,055
死透啦
Totally.

1248
01:16:03,393 --> 01:16:05,960
弄得这杂种死不瞑目
Flabbergasted that motherfucker.

1249
01:16:26,549 --> 01:16:28,483
假如我知晓事情会如此...
If I had any idea...

1250
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:35,030
还有狗吗
Anymore dogs?

1251
01:16:37,327 --> 01:16:39,026
人呢
People?

1252
01:16:39,028 --> 01:16:40,661
没  没在这里
No. Not here.

1253
01:16:40,663 --> 01:16:43,865
他们...上路离开了
They're... up the road.

1254
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:58,813
我不想进监狱
I don't want to go to jail.

1255
01:17:37,086 --> 01:17:40,154
有人知道怎么给汽车搭线吗
Does anyone know how to hotwire a car?

1256
01:17:40,156 --> 01:17:41,522
不
No.

1257
01:17:41,524 --> 01:17:43,858
算了  离开大路走更安全
I'd stay off the road anyway.

1258
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:02,677
你要对我开枪吗
Are you gonna shoot me?

1259
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:05,646
乌姆在哪儿
Where's Werm?

1260
01:18:06,783 --> 01:18:08,319
送他回家...
We sent him home...

1261
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:09,717
走出林子前  别说话
Stay quiet till we're out.

1262
01:18:33,676 --> 01:18:35,716
前面是他家宅地
It's the residents.

1263
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:38,513
他们在干什么
What are they doing?

1264
01:18:38,515 --> 01:18:40,915
你不会想亲眼目睹的
Something you don't want to see.

1265
01:18:43,086 --> 01:18:45,887
到达果园后  我们可以打电话报警
We can call the cops when we get to the orchard.

1266
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,660
可曾亲眼见他们死去
Did you see them die?

1267
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:56,163
有两个
Two.

1268
01:18:56,165 --> 01:18:57,798
第三个没见到
Not the third.

1269
01:19:01,838 --> 01:19:04,005
我要走上前去
I think I'm going.

1270
01:19:05,675 --> 01:19:07,875
你到了果园再叫警察吧
You can call the cops when you get there.

1271
01:19:07,877 --> 01:19:10,745
要是敢玩消失  我会找到你的
If you disappear, I'll find you.

1272
01:19:10,747 --> 01:19:12,013
会的
I will.

1273
01:19:16,953 --> 01:19:18,185
我发誓
I promise.

1274
01:19:20,223 --> 01:19:22,156
你应该跟他一起离开
You should go, too.

1275
01:19:23,593 --> 01:19:25,326
只是想增大胜面而已
Just hedge our bets.

1276
01:19:26,829 --> 01:19:29,697
你那枪里只剩三发子弹...
You got three rounds...

1277
01:19:29,699 --> 01:19:32,600
一只手怎么给霰弹枪上弹
and I've seen you pump a shotgun.

1278
01:19:32,602 --> 01:19:34,802
话很在理
Fair enough.

1279
01:19:50,153 --> 01:19:51,752
信得过他吗
Do you believe him?

1280
01:19:53,189 --> 01:19:55,289
嘘
Shh.

1281
01:20:07,737 --> 01:20:09,170
快吃
Nimm futter!

1282
01:20:12,275 --> 01:20:13,307
快吃
Nimm futter!

1283
01:20:19,115 --> 01:20:21,248
快吃
Nimm futter!

1284
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:23,217
快吃  快点吃
Nimm futter! Nimm futter!

1285
01:20:24,253 --> 01:20:26,053
-我的天啊  -快吃
- Jesus. - Nimm futter!

1286
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:29,690
应该够了
That ought to be enough.

1287
01:20:29,692 --> 01:20:31,726
别管  别管
Lass es! Lass es!

1288
01:20:31,728 --> 01:20:32,960
别管
Lass es!

1289
01:20:32,962 --> 01:20:35,129
做得好
So ist's brav.

1290
01:20:35,131 --> 01:20:36,397
走吧  走吧
Aus. Aus.

1291
01:20:41,204 --> 01:20:42,803
脚印抹掉
Wipe it down!

1292
01:20:46,075 --> 01:20:47,942
你认为他们会开着引擎吗
Do you think they'd leave the engine on?

1293
01:20:47,944 --> 01:20:51,012
对  直到耗尽油箱为止
Yeah. It'll run the gauge down too.

1294
01:20:51,014 --> 01:20:53,214
打电话给警察吧
Let's call this in.

1295
01:20:55,718 --> 01:20:57,251
快走  快走
Aus. Aus.

1296
01:20:57,253 --> 01:20:58,653
狗那边你搞得定吗
You got the dog?

1297
01:21:00,123 --> 01:21:01,123
我负责狗这边
I got the dog.

1298
01:21:05,161 --> 01:21:06,727
栓好狗
Tie him up.

1299
01:21:08,364 --> 01:21:10,331
枪给我
Give me your gun.

1300
01:21:10,333 --> 01:21:12,099
我没带枪
I don't have one.

1301
01:21:12,101 --> 01:21:14,902
不找支枪出来  我就喂你吃子弹
I'll shoot you either way if you don't hand me one.

1302
01:21:22,245 --> 01:21:23,444
扔掉
Throw it.

1303
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:42,189
把现场做得像是我们的错
They're making it our fault.

1304
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:47,128
这可是擅自闯入
You were trespassing.

1305
01:22:54,003 --> 01:22:56,237
在我眼里  这让人起疑心
It looks fishy to me.

1306
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:58,806
用布料来封口
The cloth is to make it seal.

1307
01:22:58,808 --> 01:23:00,508
我可不会这么干
I wouldn't do it like that.

1308
01:23:01,911 --> 01:23:02,943
枪被他们缴了
They got my gun.

1309
01:23:02,945 --> 01:23:04,705
-闭嘴  -听着...
- Shut up. - Listen...

1310
01:23:19,729 --> 01:23:22,029
真要下手吗
So we're doing that?

1311
01:23:22,031 --> 01:23:24,365
不然过来干什么
Why else would we walk up here?

1312
01:23:26,869 --> 01:23:29,469
说不清  只是觉得...
I don't know. And I was gonna...

1313
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:32,807
会毁了犯罪现场
ruin the crime scene.

1314
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:35,242
哦
Oh.

1315
01:23:35,244 --> 01:23:38,078
不过是弄个新的犯罪现场罢了
I thought we'd leave a new one.

1316
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:55,262
这一切...
This...

1317
01:23:56,866 --> 01:23:58,532
真是场噩梦
is a nightmare.

1318
01:24:00,303 --> 01:24:01,569
对我们来说何尝不是
For us all.

1319
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:07,374
跟我说  此番话就是他的愚蠢遗言
Tell me those stupid fucking words are his last.

1320
01:24:15,885 --> 01:24:17,451
你可有手机
Do you have a phone?

1321
01:24:21,824 --> 01:24:23,324
真好笑
It's funny.

1322
01:24:25,027 --> 01:24:27,294
昨晚你听上去如此可怕
You were so scary at night.

1323
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:37,164
我要打电话报警
We need the police.

1324
01:25:57,987 --> 01:25:59,192
好  我是来自华盛顿特区来的
Okay, I'm the Ain't Rights

1325
01:25:59,193 --> 01:26:00,054
"非我权利"乐队成员
from Washington, D.C.

1326
01:26:00,056 --> 01:26:01,922
呃  严格说来  我们来自阿林顿
Uh, technically, we're from Arlington.

1327
01:26:01,924 --> 01:26:05,292
不错  不过这曲子是为"锡赛德动力"写的
Nice. Uh, and this is for Seaside HCFM.

1328
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:12,666
好说  能付起出版费就干
Yeah, if we can afford it.

1329
01:26:12,668 --> 01:26:15,135
哦  咋不  我认真研究了的谱曲风格
Yeah, no, I really dig the analogue style.

1330
01:26:15,137 --> 01:26:15,819
这让我意识到
Uh, which brings me to the fact

1331
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:17,638
你们这样的乐队可是打着灯笼难找啊
that you guys are hard to find.

1332
01:27:10,059 --> 01:27:11,592
我想清楚怎么做了
I know what it is.

1333
01:27:15,731 --> 01:27:17,631
哪儿跟哪儿啊
What what is?

1334
01:27:22,738 --> 01:27:25,372
我心中的荒岛乐园队
My desert island band.

1335
01:27:25,112 --> 01:27:35,112
{\an2\fs16\shad0\bord0\c&HFFFFFF&\b1\fn方正准圆_GBK\c&HECB000&\b1}

1336
01:27:30,679 --> 01:27:33,580
跟别人说吧  看他是否在乎
Tell somebody who gives a shit.

1337
01:27:35,112 --> 01:27:41,112
