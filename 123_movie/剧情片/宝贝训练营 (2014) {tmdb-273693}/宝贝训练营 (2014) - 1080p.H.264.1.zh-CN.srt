1
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,915
嘿,西奥。这里太黑了。
Hey, Theo. It's so dark in here.

2
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,338
-你在施魔法吗?——没有。
- You doin' some magic? - No.

3
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,673
是啊，我有一段时间没看过你表演魔术了。
Yeah, I haven't seen you do any tricks in a while.

4
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,926
好吧，我想我会忘记寄给你的邮件。
Well, guess I'll forget about what came in the mail for you.

5
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,595
我的邮件里有什么?
What came in the mail for me?

6
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:02,390
你被邀请来参加这个地方…魔法学院。
You've been invited to attend this place... The Institute of Magic.

7
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,894
它在山上。这是一个为期五周的强化学习。
It's up in the mountains. It's a five-week intensive study where...

8
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,355
我知道魔法学院是什么了。
I know what the Institute of Magic is.

9
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,857
爸爸和我经常谈论这件事。
Dad and I used to talk about it all the time.

10
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,870
你内心有个声音，这个声音在说，
There's a voice inside of you, and it's the voice that says,

11
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,790
“我想成为一个魔术师。”
"I want to be a magician."

12
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,375
你好,西奥。
Hello, Theo.

13
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,876
他怎么知道我的名字的?
How did he know my name?

14
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,004
我怎么知道你的名字?你的申请表上有。
How did I know your name? It was on your application.

15
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:38,510
西奥，我是国家宝藏罗伊·普雷斯顿，我也听到了声音。
Theo, I'm national treasure Roy Preston, and I hear voices too.

16
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:42,722
三年前，我成立了魔法学院，
Shribbity-three-ish years ago, I founded the Institute of Magic,

17
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,642
为有前途的年轻魔术师而设的音乐学院。
a conservatory for promising young magicians.

18
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:50,313
在这里，世界著名的魔术师将教你七种魔术。
Here, world-famous magicians will teach you the seven types of magic.

19
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,940
花招。
Sleight of hand.

20
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,361
预测。
Prediction.

21
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,032
恢复。
Restoration.

22
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:04,994
消失……和外表。
Vanish... and appearance.

23
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,497
固体……通过固体。
Solid... through solid.

24
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:10,709
逃跑。
Escape.

25
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,545
悬浮。
Levitation.

26
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,588
然后你就可以表演了
And you will get to perform

27
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:19,259
在世界著名的罗伊·普雷斯顿纪念剧院。
in the world-famous Roy Preston Prememorial Theater.

28
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:23,221
你会和其他年轻的魔术师建立持久的关系。
And you'll build lasting relationships with other young magicians.

29
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:27,267
即使是那些奇怪的。因为在这里，我们都是怪胎。
Even the weird ones. Because here, we're all the weird ones.

30
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,521
哇。很酷的鸟,兰德尔。
Wow. Cool bird, Randall.

31
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,858
但不要相信我的话。今年夏天你自己来看看吧。
But don't take my word for it. Come see for yourself this summer.

32
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,364
魔法营听起来很酷吧?
Magic camp sounds pretty cool?

33
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,492
这不是“魔法营”。是魔法学院。
It's not "magic camp." It's the Institute of Magic.

34
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,286
这完全是著名的。
It's totally famous.

35
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,621
但我不知道。
But I don't know.

36
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,875
今年夏天我应该呆在家里。
I should stay home this summer.

37
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,297
你需要我来修剪草坪和招待卡梅隆
You need me to mow the lawn and to entertain Cameron.

38
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,008
我很好。而且你也没那么有趣。
I'm fine. And you're not that entertaining.

39
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:05,388
我想你可能对这个感兴趣，但如果你不感兴趣，也没关系。
I thought you might be interested in this, but if you're not, that's okay.

40
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,599
等待。
Wait.

41
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,144
爸爸总是说他想让我去那里。
Dad always said he wanted me to go there.

42
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:15,732
他以前一定申请过我……你知道的。
He must have applied for me before... you know.

43
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,612
如果爸爸肯花时间帮我申请，我也许应该……
If Dad took the time to apply for me, I should probably...

44
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,114
你可以花整个夏天修剪草坪，
You could spend the summer mowing the lawn,

45
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:27,327
或者你可以和世界上最伟大的魔术师一起学习魔术。
or you can study magic with the world's greatest magicians.

46
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,378
-你有票吗?——亲爱的。
- Do you have the tickets? - Honey.

47
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,713
-不，我没有票。-你拿到票了!
- No, I don't have the tickets. - You have the tickets!

48
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:43,885
“这一代最伟大的魔术师。”是的,对的。
"This generation's greatest magician." Yeah, right.

49
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,929
我们在里约热内卢电视台看到Penn和Teller。
We're seeing Penn and Teller at the Rio.

50
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,097
太好了。
Great.

51
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,393
-昨晚我们看到了克里斯·达伍德。——头脑吹。
- Last night we saw Kris Darkwood. - Minds blown.

52
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,521
然后黑木让凯撒的大卫雕像完全消失了。
And then Darkwood made the David statue at Caesars totally disappear.

53
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,980
我的头还在爆炸。
My head is still exploding.

54
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,027
克里斯汀娜·达伍德在维加斯有最令人兴奋的表演。
Kristina Darkwood has the most mind-blowing show in Vegas.

55
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,822
这不是令人兴奋的。你的头不会爆炸，我保证。
It's not mind-blowing. Your head will not explode, I promise you.

56
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,745
天啊。这里面有什么?
Geez. What do you got in this thing?

57
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:12,872
汤!
Soup!

58
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:16,960
我很抱歉。我发誓我有一张20美元的钞票。
I'm so sorry. I swear I had a 20-dollar bill in here.

59
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,382
它去了哪里?也许在这里。我去找找看。
Where did it go? Maybe it's in here. I'll look for it.

60
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,010
我的。不，不在这里。
My. No, it's not here.

61
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,721
在这儿。
Here it is.

62
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,807
——找到它。!谢天谢地。
- Found it. ! Thank heavens.

63
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,269
我可以要回12美元吗?
Can I have $12 back?

64
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,276
上次我试着做个好人。
Last time I try to be a nice guy.

65
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,319
“好”可能有点言过其实了。
"Nice" may be an overstatement.

66
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:48,199
罗伊。嘿。你在这里做什么?
Roy. Hey. What are you doing here?

67
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:49,909
拉斯维加斯,宝贝。
Vegas, baby.

68
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,872
另外，你能送我到希望街123号吗?
Also, can you take me to 123 Hope Street, please?

69
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,084
安迪，生意怎么样?
So, Andy, how's business?

70
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,337
生活的梦想。
Living the dream.

71
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,631
我刚学会了一个叫做“Uber把我的工资减半”的新把戏。
I just learned this awesome new trick called "Uber cuts my paychecks in half."

72
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:09,095
嗯，你很幸运，因为今年夏天我有一个顾问空缺。
Well, you are in luck because I have a counselor opening this summer.

73
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:12,265
大卫·布莱恩退出了，你是我想到的第一个名字。
David Blaine dropped out, and you were the first name I thought of.

74
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,350
——真的吗?-是的。
- Really? - Yeah.

75
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,353
大卫·布莱恩退出了，我是名单上的第二个名字。
David Blaine drops out, and I'm the second name on the list.

76
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,646
我从没说过你是名单上的第二名。
I never said you were the second name on the list.

77
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,857
我说你是我想到的第一个人。
I said you were the first person I thought of.

78
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,525
你是…
You were...

79
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,694
你在名单上排名很靠后。
You were pretty far down there on the list.

80
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:28,365
我很欣赏你的直率诚实，但我不再施魔法了。
Well, I appreciate your blunt honesty, but I don't do magic anymore.

81
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,784
我已经很长时间没有了。用黑木制作自…
I haven't for a long time. Ever since Darkwood...

82
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:34,496
是的。我很抱歉，我不怪你。
Yes. I'm so sorry and I-I don't blame you.

83
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,664
——真的吗?——没有。
- Really? - No.

84
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:39,876
你不能全心全意地爱上魔术
You cannot love magic with your whole heart

85
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,961
直到你的心再次完整。
until your heart is whole again.

86
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:45,924
这就是……与魔法有关的陈词滥调听起来很深奥
And there it is... the magic-related clichés which sound profound

87
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,425
但实际上毫无意义。
but are actually meaningless.

88
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,512
你知道，我会想念那些，但我还是不会回来。
You know, I'm gonna miss those, but I'm still not coming back.

89
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,224
Kris将在今年夏天回归。
Kris is coming back this summer.

90
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,768
用黑木制作- - - - - - ?-克里斯·达伍德，是的。
- Darkwood? - Kris Darkwood, yeah.

91
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,730
所以她会有她自己的小屋我也会有我自己的小屋?
So she would have her own cabin and I would have my own cabin?

92
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:04,776
你们两个都将与年轻的魔术师紧密合作。
Both of you will be working very closely with the, young magicians.

93
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:08,822
那大礼帽呢?你现在还这么做，对吧?这是一间小屋对一间小屋，胜者全得?
And the Top Hat? You still do that, right? It's cabin versus cabin, winner takes all?

94
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,866
是的，我的意思是，你知道高帽比赛是怎么运作的。
Yes, I mean, you know how the Top Hat competition works.

95
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:19,833
哦，Weiners的世界。好了。希望您预订了房间。
Ooh, World Of Weiners. Nice. Hope you got a reservation.

96
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,128
不管怎样，想一想。
Anyway, think about it.

97
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,922
因为我知道你还能让他们走…
Because I know you can still make 'em go...

98
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,845
“哇。”
"Wow."

99
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,643
那家伙很好。
That guy is good.

100
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,729
忘记了我的电话。你能把我的电话递给我吗?
Forgot my phone. Can you hand me my phone?

101
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,273
哦。那将是一个非常酷的退出。
Ooh. That would have been a really cool exit.

102
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:47,485
你知道我买了多少热狗他们才会让我这么做吗?
You know how many hot dogs I had to buy so they would let me do that to the sign?

103
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:51,990
一百年。我也不会骄傲地说我吃了14个。
A hundred. And I'm not proud to say I ate 14 of them.

104
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:03,001
-给你。-玩得开心，保罗。
- Here it is. - Have fun, Paul.

105
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,006
——获得乐趣。女孩,再见。再见!
- Have fun. - Bye-bye girls. Bye!

106
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,090
再见!
Bye!

107
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,719
这些都是世界闻名的魔术师吗?
These are all world-famous magicians?

108
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,723
-他们看起来像一群ner…-要交新朋友。
- They look like a bunch of ner... - New friends to make.

109
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,266
再告诉我一遍。
Tell me one more time.

110
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,519
毒葛有三个杏仁状的小叶，颜色从浅绿色到红色，
Poison ivy has three almond-shaped leaflets, light green to red in color,

111
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,104
常在水源附近发现。
often found near a water source.

112
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:26,316
经常，但不总是，内森。来吧，把你的脑袋放进去!
Often but not always, Nathan. Come on, get your head in the game!

113
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,110
妈妈，爸爸，我有我的肾上腺素注射器，我的费内根
Mother, Father, I've got my EpiPen, my Phenergan,

114
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,780
我的手镯上用十种语言写着"花生过敏"
my bracelet that says "peanut allergy" in ten languages.

115
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,699
还有我的尿滤器以防我被困在什么地方
Plus I have my uropathy filter in case I get stranded somewhere

116
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,493
还得喝自己的尿
and have to drink my own pee.

117
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,952
我们已经尽力了。
We've done all we can.

118
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:40,455
记住，不要害怕任何事情。
Remember, don't be afraid of anything.

119
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,874
凡事都要害怕。
Be afraid of everything.

120
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:47,128
兔子在哪里?第一次拥抱是什么时候?
Where are the bunnies? And what time is the first cuddle?

121
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,173
我也喜欢兔子。
I love bunnies too.

122
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,466
他们是美味的。
They're delicious.

123
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,261
来吧,儿子。
Come on, son.

124
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,808
爸爸，我真的必须戴这个领结吗?
Dad, do I really have to wear this bow tie?

125
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,018
就像脖子上挂着"踢我"的牌子。
It's like wearing a "kick me" sign on my neck.

126
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:05,271
没有领结，你只是另一个魔术师。
Without that bow tie, you are just another magician.

127
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:09,484
但你是科尔内留斯·凯斯勒的儿子…神奇的皇室。
But you're Kornelius Kessler's son... Magic royalty.

128
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,695
记住，只有金魔杖才有用。
Now remember, nothing but the Golden Wand will do.

129
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,372
如果你需要我，我会在密苏里州的布兰森。
If you need me, I'll be in Branson, Missouri.

130
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:18,243
你父亲让我告诉你要好好玩。
Your father instructed me to tell you to have a good time.

131
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,994
他还要求我把这个给你。
He also asked that I give you this.

132
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,290
你妈妈让我给你这个。
And your mother asked that I give you this.

133
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:25,875
一,二。
One, two.

134
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,795
詹妮尔，和往常一样，我必须请求你
And, Janelle, as always, I must request,

135
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,023
既然是我来找你，
since I would be the one who would have to come find you,

136
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,300
请不要像在其他营地那样逃跑。
please don't run away like you have at so many other camps.

137
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,011
也许你可以试着参与进来。
Maybe you could even try to participate.

138
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,096
我不作任何承诺，汉密尔顿。
I make no promises, Hamilton.

139
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,266
也许我们可以试着让这种态度消失。
Maybe we can try and make that attitude disappear.

140
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,817
宝贝，安迪·达克曼回来了!

141
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,051
-嘿，你去哪?我就在这里。——用黑木制作它!
- Hey, where you going? I'm right here. - It's Darkwood!

142
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,619
这就跟你问声好！你好吗?嗨。谢谢你！
Hi! How are you? Hi. Thank you.

143
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:05,206
嗨。嗨。你们喜欢魔术吗?
Hi. Hi. Do you guys like magic?

144
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,833
是啊!
Yeah!

145
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:21,848
我还得签到。
I still have to sign in.

146
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:25,602
我不知道我是否属于这里。我只是在房间里玩牌。
I don't know if I belong here. I just play with cards in my room.

147
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,937
我知道你很害怕
I know you're scared,

148

但要记住你最初来这里的原因。
but remember why you came in the first place.

149
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,651
亲爱的，我也想他。
Honey, I miss him too.

150
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,321
但让我问你一件事。
But let me ask you one thing.

151
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,032
你喜欢魔术吗?
Do you love magic?

152
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,372
我们能不能趁我还没被人逮到之前离开这里?
Can we get outta here before I get any geek on me?

153
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,874
别担心你的房间。
Don't worry about your room.

154
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,293
我不会同时有超过十个朋友在那里。
I'll never have more than ten friends in there at one time.

155
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,879
传说许多年前，

罗伊·普雷斯顿，世界上最重要的…不，检查一下，最多五张
Roy Preston, the world's foremost... No, check that, five-most

踢踏舞魔术师就消失在这个建筑里了

158
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:04,808
如果你大声尖叫，他可能会再次出现。

00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,235
欢迎来到罗伊·普雷斯顿的史前剧院。
Welcome to Roy Preston's Prememorial Theater.

160
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,989
你能为我鼓掌两次吗?
Can you clap twice for me?

161
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,909
你会跺脚吗?
Can you stomp your feet?

162
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:26,329
现在分解一下。是的。
Now break it down. Yeah.

163
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,581
其他人是怎么知道的?
How does everyone else know this?

164
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:32,210
布拉沃。布拉沃。很好。
Bravo. Bravo. Very good.

167
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:40,135
那你就会做得更好。

168
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:44,514
还有比最好中的最好中最好的小木屋
And the cabin that does better than the best of the best of the best

169
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,307
在我们最后的表演中

170
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:50,395
将赢得梦寐以求的礼帽奖

171
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:59,946
对于这个被认为是最杰出的年轻魔术师来说……
And for the young magician who is deemed to be the most exceptional...

172
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,284
哇。

00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,577
黄金棒。

我已经赢了三场。

带领黑桃舱，薛西斯!

179

欢迎来到一个下雪的夏天。

180
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,397
哇。
Whoa.

181
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:41,237
现在，俱乐部的领导，莉娜·兰伯特!
And now, leader of the Clubs, Lena Lambert!

182
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:48,536
谁敢喝魔法杯?
Who dares drink from the goblet of magic?

183
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,622
令人毛骨悚然的。
Spooky.

184
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,422
哇。
Whoa.

185
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,178
哇!
Whoa!

186
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:15,689
哇。
Whoa.

187
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,192
下一位魔术师无需介绍
Our next magician needs no introduction

188
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:23,863
但她是钻石之王，克里斯汀娜·达伍德!
except she's the leader of the Diamonds, Kristina Darkwood!

189
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:27,617
唵嘛呢叭咪吽,微小的人类。
Abracadabra, tiny humans.

190
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,327
哇。
Whoa.

191
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:33,498
很明显,这是电线。请。
It's wires, obviously. Please.

192
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,794
我看到你。我知道你的希望。
I see you. I know your hopes.

193
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,839
你梦想成为谁?告诉你的邻居。
Who do you dream of being? Tell your neighbor.

194
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:44,259
在他耳边说。
Whisper it in his ear.

195
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,344
它是……
Was it...

196
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:48,722
尼克乔纳斯?
Nick Jonas?

197
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,642
嗯,这是错误的。
Um, that's wrong.

198
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:56,021
我梦想成为乔纳斯·索尔克，而不是乔纳斯兄弟。
I dreamed of being Jonas Salk, not a Jonas brother.

199
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,480
——谁?-你确定吗?
- Who? - Are you sure?

200
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:01,401
尼克·乔纳斯超级可爱。你可能会迷失在那双眼睛里。
Nick Jonas is super cute. You could get lost in those eyes.

201
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:07,323
嗯，是的，他很帅。但很抱歉，我说乔纳斯·索尔克。
Um, yes, he is very handsome. But I'm sorry, I said Jonas Salk.

202
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,577

00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:14,164
教父的抗生素。

我的绝地大师。
My Jedi Master.

205
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:18,960
我很抱歉。这是尴尬的。
I'm sorry. This is awkward.

206
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:21,629
也许别人夺走了你的梦想。
Maybe someone else took your dream.

207
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:25,175
你!先生,打扰一下!
You! Sir, excuse me!

208
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:29,262
我想你可能无意中带走了这个小男孩的梦想。
I think you may have accidentally taken this young boy's dream.

209
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:32,432
不。我没有带走一个孩子的梦想。
No. I didn't take a child's dream.

210
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:35,018
我以为我们都知道这个房间里只有一个偷梦的人。
Think we all know there's only one dream stealer in this room.

211
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,520
检查你的口袋里。
Check your pocket.

212
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,529
不可能。
No way.

213
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:47,655
乔纳斯·索尔克。
Jonas Salk.

214
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,369
乔纳斯·索尔克。
Jonas Salk.

215
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,288
魔法。
Magic.

216
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:59,000
不，这不是魔法。这只是统计数据。真的。
No, it's not magic. It's just statistics. Really.

217
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:01,086
82%的人说“乔纳斯·索尔克”。
Eighty-two percent of people say "Jonas Salk."

218
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,254
太酷了，她在这里当辅导员。
It's so cool she's a counselor here.

219
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:06,633
为我们最后的顾问，心灵的领袖…
For our last counselor, leader of the Hearts...

220
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,176
大卫布莱恩?
David Blaine?

221
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:11,137
——大卫·布莱恩?没有办法,真的吗?——嘿,嘿。
- David Blaine? No way, really? - Hey, hey.

222
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,309
-不是大卫·布莱恩——哦。
- It's, not David Blaine. - Aw.

223
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:21,189
但是代替他的是学院的一位传奇人物，
But in his place is one of the great institute legends,

224
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:24,984
一个令人难以置信的天才，他的工作是可以找到的
an incredible talent whose work can be found

225
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:29,781
整个拉斯维加斯大道，会议中心和当地机场，

226
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:33,034
安迪Duckerman先生。
Mr. Andy Duckerman.

227
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:38,540
嘿。有什么事吗?我是安迪。
Hey. What's up? I'm Andy.

228
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:41,793
你愿意上台来吗?你想玩些把戏吗?
Would you like to come up on the stage? Would you like to do some tricks?

229
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:46,089
我甚至没有带任何把戏…要做的事情。
I didn't even bring any tricks... to do.

230
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:47,841
你知道吗?
You know what?

231
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:51,970
我不会耍小把戏，因为这是你们的舞台，伙计们。
I'm not gonna do a trick, because it's your stage, guys.

232
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,055
它不是我的。
It's not mine.

233
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:58,601
我也不偷孩子们的梦想，因为我没必要这么做。
And I don't steal children's dreams, 'cause I don't have to.

234
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:04,691
我赢过三次金魔杖。繁荣!
I've won the Golden Wand three times. Boom!

235
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,746
你知道吗?我要很快地抓住这些。
You know what? I'm gonna grab these real quick.

236
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,285
继续工作。伟大的东西。
Carry on. Great stuff.

237
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,328
-谢谢，安迪。——三次!
- Thank you, Andy. - Three times!

238
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,622
好了，是时候让你找到自己的路了
Okay, so it's time for you to find your way

239
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:22,751
回到你们指定的小木屋。
out back to your designated cabins.

240
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,961
我们怎么知道去哪里?
Um, how do we know where to go?

241
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:28,381
露丝，只有你才知道答案。
Ruth, only you hold that answer.

242
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,594
是的!钻石是最好的!
Yes! Diamonds are the best!

243
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:43,229
好消息。我们在一张床上。想分享我的加湿器吗?
Good news. We're in the same bunk. Wanna share my humidifier?

244
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:47,108
要么是这样，要么是斯蒂芬·库里的篮球训练营，
It was either this or basketball camp with Steph Curry,

245
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:50,445
但是妈妈说我这个夏天一定要玩得开心，所以我当然选择了这个。
but Mother said I had to have fun this summer, so of course I chose this.

246
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:53,239
——嘿,菜鸟。——“菜鸟”?
- Hey, noobs. - "Noobs"?

247
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:58,244
是的,像“新手”。比如"初来乍到" "不懂事"
Yeah, like "newbie." Like "new to camp," like "doesn't know the ropes."

248
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,914
没有“招式”。
Doesn't have the "moves."

249
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:06,628
这个名字是维克。在“胜利”。
The name's Vic. As in "victory."

250
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,213
去年金棒奖得主。
Last year's Golden Wand winner.

251
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,007
嘿。西奥。
Hey. Theo.

252
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:14,177
让我看看你怎么做。是时候欺骗受害者了。
Let me see you do a trick. Time to trick the Vic.

253
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,638
嗯,好吧。确定。
Um, okay. Sure.

254
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,098
嗯…
Um...

255
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:21,059
-选一张牌。任何卡。-我好像见过这个。
- Pick a card. Any card. - Think I've seen this one before.

256
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:22,268
我还没开始呢。
I haven't even started.

257
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,522
我只是在跟你开玩笑。
I'm just messing with ya.

258
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:27,899
继续，你做得很好。
Keep going, you're doing great.

259
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,527
我只是…嗯…
I just... Um...

260
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:41,287
好吧，我要拿走你的黑桃皇后然后…
Okay, I'm gonna take your queen of spades and...

261
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,378
别担心。只是新手的神经。让我告诉你怎么做。
Don't worry. Just noob nerves. Let me show you how it's done.

262
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,424
所以我有一个空杯子和一瓶水。
So I have an empty cup and a bottle of water.

263
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:55,468
我要把它倒在这里，这样你会看到一切都是合法的。
I'm gonna pour it in here just so you see everything's legit.

264
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:57,554
哦。
Ooh.

265
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,100
看看这个。
Check this out.

266
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,772
空的。哈!
Empty. Ta-da!

267
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:09,566
很酷，维克。
That was cool, Vic.

268
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,193
等等，还有一个部分。
Wait, but there's one more part to this trick.

269
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:17,741
那是不必要的。
That was uncalled for.

270
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:21,286
去和乔纳斯·索尔克私奔吧。
Go run away with Jonas Salk.

271
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,830
祝你创造dweeb疫苗好运!
Good luck creating a dweeb vaccine!

272
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,916
神奇的营地。即使是恶霸也是书呆子。
Magic camp. Even the bullies are nerds.

273
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,461
当国王真好。
It's good to be the king.

274
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,507
-你是最棒的!-非常感谢。
- You're the best ever! - Thank you so much.

275
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:37,552
-给你。——谢谢。
- Here you go. - Thank you.

276
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,263
我知道你在看我。我就在这里。
I know you see me. I'm right here.

277
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,351
克里斯蒂娜。我没看见你在那儿。
Kristina. I didn't see you there.

278
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:47,145
嗨,安迪。已经太久了。-我爱你，克里斯蒂娜!
- Hi, Andy. It's been too long. - I love you, Kristina!

279
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:49,731
我本来想说时间还不够长。
I was actually gonna say it hasn't been long enough.

280
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,608
——谢谢!-。嗯…
- Thank you! - . Well...

281
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,694
我真的很惊讶在这里见到你。我以为你放弃了魔法。
I was actually surprised to see you here. I thought you'd given up magic.

282
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:56,154
我爱你。
I love you.

283
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:59,199
说实话，我只是在帮普雷斯顿一个忙。代替大卫·布莱恩。
Honestly I'm just doing Preston a favor. Filling in for David Blaine.

284
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:00,492
克里斯蒂娜，你是最棒的。
Kristina, you're the greatest.

285
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:03,912
真有趣，因为普雷斯顿让我今年夏天接替大卫。
That's funny, 'cause Preston asked me to step in for David this summer.

286
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:06,748
你是否觉得他只是在抚摸你的自尊心?
Do you think maybe he's just stroking your ego a little bit?

287
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:09,092
我很高兴你能来。回馈社会是件好事。
I'm glad you're here. It's good to give back.

288
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:11,169
指导孩子，训练下一代…
Mentor kids, train the next generation...

289
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,797
在你最意想不到的时候在背后捅你一刀
To stab you in the back when you least expect it.

290
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,050
我真的希望，你知道，我们已经度过了这一切。
I really hoped that we were, you know, past all this.

291
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:21,346
我是。我很酷。我在做…老实说，我做得很好。
I am. I'm cool. I'm doing... I'm doing great, honestly.

292
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:24,140
在世界各地为超级重要人物举办私人演出。
Doing private shows around the world for super-important people.

293
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:27,024
这就是为什么你没见过我，没听说过我的演出。
It's why you haven't seen me around, why you haven't heard of my shows.

294
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:30,105
但我向你保证，薪水相当不错。
But I assure you, it pays quite well.

295
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:34,275
这就是为什么你用垃圾袋当行李的原因。
And that's why you're using garbage bags as luggage.

296
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,779
-这是环保的东西。-其实不是。
- It's a eco-friendly thing. - It's actually not.

297
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:40,031
无论什么。我只知道我的铺位会揍你
Whatever. All I know is that my bunk is gonna beat you

298
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:42,325
就像我们小时候每年夏天我都会做的那样。
just like I did every summer when we were kids.

299
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:44,744
——好。你在。——好。你在。
- Fine. You're on. - Fine. You're on.

300
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:47,205
不,你……我在做什么?
No, you're... What am I doing?

301
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:50,000
我们是为孩子们而来的。这是荒谬的。
We're here for the kids. This is ridiculous.

302
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,753
你知道什么是荒谬的吗?你会输得多惨。
You know what's ridiculous? How bad you're gonna lose.

303
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,012
好了。
Nice.

304
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,180
——是的。嗨,伙计们!
- Yes. - Hi, guys!

305
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:07,183
欢迎,钻石!进来吧。
Welcome, Diamonds! Come on in.

306
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,978
我是受害者，去年的金魔杖奖得主。
I'm the Vic, last year's Golden Wand winner.

307
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:14,607
好了。
Nice.

308
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:17,610
就像恐怖电影里的小屋。
It's like a cabin from a horror movie.

309
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,904
——电子战。恶心。-就像一个巨大的碎片。
- Ew. Gross. - It's like one giant splinter.

310
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:22,157
啊,男人。我忘了带破伤风助推器了。
Aw, man. I forgot my tetanus booster.

311
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,659
那个浑身湿透的孩子在哪儿?
Hey, where's the kid that got all wet?

312
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:30,457
这是好的,西奥。这儿有一件干衬衫。
It's okay, Theo. Here's a dry shirt.

313
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:32,667
谢谢。
Thanks.

314
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:35,754
真不敢相信克里斯汀娜·达克伍德今年夏天会当辅导员。
I can't believe Kristina Darkwood is a counselor this summer.

315
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:38,173
我听说她像我们这么大的时候是个十足的呆子
I heard when she was our age she was a total dork,

316
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:40,842
但后来她变得非常擅长魔术，变得超级有名。
but then she got really good at magic and became super famous.

317
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,553
是的，我想我们都在祈祷这个故事。
Yeah, I think we're all crossing our fingers for that narrative.

318
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,221
你们在说Dorkwood吗?
You guys talking about Dorkwood?

319
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:49,017
是啊，她在这里露营的时候我们就是这么叫她的。
Yeah, that's what we used to call her when she was a camper here.

320
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,935
克里斯蒂娜Dorkwood。
Kristina Dorkwood.

321
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:53,899
她从来没有连续三年赢得过金魔杖，但你知道是谁赢得的吗?
She never won the Golden Wand three years in a row, but you know who did?

322
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,690
——大卫·布莱恩?——没有。
- David Blaine? - No.

323
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:58,651
事实上，是的，他做到了。但我也是。
Actually, yes, he did. But so did I.

324
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:02,113
每次都是我赢，而克里斯汀娜都输给了我。
I won, and Kristina lost every time to me.

325
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:06,034
所以，你们应该庆幸和我在一起，而不是和她在一起。
So, you should consider yourselves lucky that you ended up with me and not her.

326
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:07,452
你还在表演吗?
Do you still perform?

327
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,788
是的。在世界各地的私人演出中
Yep. In private shows all over the world.

328
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:11,748
我从没听说过你的独唱生涯
I've never heard of your solo career,

329
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:15,168
我对过去和现在的魔术师都有广博的了解。
and I have an encyclopedic knowledge of magicians both past and present.

330
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:18,230
我在谷歌上搜索了你。你的名字只和克里斯汀娜·达伍德有关…
And I googled you. Your name only comes up connected to Kristina Darkwood...

331
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,756
真的吗?让我看看。
Really? Let me see that.

332
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:23,176
哇。
Whoa.

333
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,512
酷。它是如何重现的?
Cool. How does it reappear?

334
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:28,223
它不是。直到夏天的最后一天。
It doesn't. Not until the last day of summer.

335
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:31,226
——营地规则。——“没有电话。”
- Camp rules. - "No phones."

336
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:35,855
我们来这里不是要谈论我的神奇而又超级秘密的职业生涯。
And we're not here to talk about my amazing and super-secret career.

337
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:39,859
我们来这里是为了赢得礼帽和金魔杖。
We're here to win the Top Hat and the Golden Wand.

338
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:43,405
让我来见见普雷斯顿赋予我的年轻天才。
So let me meet the young talent Preston has gifted me with.

339
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:47,450
你。你叫什么名字?你的专业是什么?
You. What is your name? What is your specialty?

340
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:50,495
我叫Ruth Brusselbach，我的专长是兔女郎。
My name is Ruth Brusselbach, and my specialty is bunnies.

341
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:53,248
我不知道那是什么意思。
I don't know what that means.

342
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:54,958
严格地说，我从来没有和它共事过，
Technically, I've never worked with one,

343
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:58,044
但是自从我看到魔术师从帽子里变出兔子后，
but ever since I saw a magician pull a rabbit out of a hat,

344
00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:00,171
我知道这是我的命运。
I knew it was my destiny.

345
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:02,424
-什么时候会发生?-明天第一件事。
- So when does that happen? - First thing tomorrow.

346
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:04,676
——是的。-你呢?你的交易是什么?
- Yes. - What about you? What's your deal?

347
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:06,302
我是凯斯勒贾德。
I'm Judd Kessler.

348
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:09,305
和科尔内留斯·凯斯勒有关系吗?
Any relation to Kornelius Kessler?

349
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:10,724
我爸爸。
My dad.

350
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:13,852
这就是你戴领结的原因!就像你爸爸的一样。
That's why you're wearing the bow tie! It's just like your dad's.

351
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:15,979
是的，这不是我的第一选择。
Yeah, it's not my first choice of accessory.

352
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:19,024
这家伙的爸爸?活着的传奇。
This guy's dad? Living legend.

353
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:20,984
这一定会使你成为一个神奇的纯种马。
That must make you a magic thoroughbred.

354
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:23,236
我不确定魔法是怎么起作用的。
I'm not sure that's how magic works.

355
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,780
这更多是一种隐性基因，比如眼睛颜色或血型。
It's more of a recessive gene like eye color or blood type.

356
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:27,049
不要害羞。给我看些东西。
Don't be shy. Show me somethin'.

357
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:30,118
听着，我只是想告诉你我不知道怎么做杂志…
Look, I'm just trying to tell you that I don't know how to do mag...

358
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:32,388
我不用担心你。你可以在早上给我看。
I don't have to worry about you. You can show me in the morning.

359
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:33,413
”凯。
'Kay.

360
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:37,792
仙特克，你有戏法要给我看吗?
Zyrtec, you got a trick you wanna show me?

361
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:41,713
那其实是我的Zyrtec衬衫。大风扇。
That's actually my Zyrtec shirt. Big fan.

362
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:45,216
嗯,我的弟弟。
Um, I'm Theo.

363
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,385
嗯，也不完全是。
And, um, not really.

364
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:50,349
它不需要是一个新的把戏。就是你去年夏天学到的东西。
It doesn't need to be a new trick. Just anything you learned last summer.

365
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:53,266
这实际上是我在这里的第一年。
This is actually my first year here.

366
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,809
——是的。我也是。——我也是。
- Yep. Me too. - Me too.

367
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:56,811
你们都是新手?
You're all newbies?

368
00:23:56,895 --> 00:23:58,188
是的。
Yeah.

369
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:03,276
普雷斯顿。
Preston.

370
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:10,533
蒂娜,Zozo,亚历克斯。
Tina, Zozo, Alex.

371
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:13,328
哇。真的很喜欢这个小兔子。
Wow. Really committed to this bunny thing.

372
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,248
兔子爱不是“东西”。这是一种生活方式。
Bunny love is not a "thing." It's a way of life.

373
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:22,253
就像一个武士…只有更多的兔子。
Like being a samurai... only with more bunnies.

374
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:24,339
好吧。
Okay.

375
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:31,680
嘿，我忘了问。你专业是什么?
Hey, I forgot to ask. What's your specialty?

376
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:33,306
我不确定。卡,我猜。
I'm not sure. Cards, I guess.

377
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,392
你在申请表上写了什么?
What did you put on your application?

378
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:38,353
我不知道。我爸爸填的。
I don't know. My dad filled it out.

379
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:41,523
明白了。再次感谢你让我睡下铺。
Gotcha. And thanks again for letting me take the bottom bunk.

380
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,277
正如我之前提到的，我是一个喜欢在晚上撒尿的人。和梦游。
As I mentioned before, I'm a bit of a night pee-er. And sleepwalker.

381
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,155
不幸的是，并不总是按照这个顺序。
Unfortunately, not always in that order.

382
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:53,368
有时，我无缘无故地在半夜尖叫着醒来。
And sometimes, for no reason, I wake up in the middle of the night screaming.

383
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:55,286
早上4点见。
Welp, see you at 4:00 a.m.

384
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:58,915
好了,伙计们。熄灯。大的明天。
Okay, guys. Lights out. Big day tomorrow.

385
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,501
你得证明给我看，我不是在浪费时间。
You get to prove to me that I'm not wasting my time here.

386
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:03,211
Alaka-zip-it。
Alaka-zip-it.

387
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:05,380
太酷了!
Cool!

388
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:09,134
我认为他不太喜欢我们。
I don't think he likes us very much.

389
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:13,138
他用垃圾袋当行李。很明显，他甚至不喜欢自己。
He uses trash bags as luggage. He clearly doesn't even like himself.

390
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:16,641
人吗?我能听见。我就在这里。
Guys? I can hear you. I'm right here.

391
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,733
选择一个卡。记住它。
Pick a card. Memorize it.

392
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:26,401
把它放回去。
Put it back.

393
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:33,033
好吧。现在，把你的卡放在中间，对吗?
Okay. Now, you put your card in the middle, right?

394
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:34,117
是的。
Yeah.

395
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:38,204
那它是怎么重新出现在顶部的呢?
Then how come it reappeared at the top?

396
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:40,415
哇。你是怎么做到的?
Whoa. How did you do that?

397
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:42,959
魔术师从不泄露他的秘密。
A magician never reveals his secrets.

398
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:46,546
但如果我把这些卡片给你，我就可以教你。
But if I give these cards to you, then I can teach you.

399
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:52,552
早上好,露营者。
Good morning, campers.

400
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:55,055
离高帽比赛还有34天。
Thirty-four days until the Top Hat competition.

401
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:57,557
是时候关注一些骗局了。
Time to focus on some hocus-pocus.

402
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,143
午餐是红酱意大利面。
Lunch will be spaghetti in red sauce.

403
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:04,898
逃脱是每个真正魔术师的武器库的基本元素。
Escape is a fundamental element in every true magician's arsenal.

404
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:09,319
所以我们要做最基本的逃跑。
So we're gonna be doing the most basic of escapes.

405
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:12,030
手被绑在前面。非常容易。
Hands tied in front. Very easy.

406
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:15,325
听着，我刚刚做到了。好吧，我们试试。
Look, I just did it. Okay, let's try it.

407
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:18,203
好的，用手在结的背面摩擦。的背。
Okay, rub your hands on the back of the knot. On the back.

408
00:26:18,286 --> 00:26:21,164
不要咬它。不要咬它。
Do not bite it. Do not bite it.

409
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,458
这不是背面。那是完全不对的。
That is not the back. That is not right at all.

410
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:26,461
-后面的ha…-谁来帮帮我!
- Back of the ha... - Somebody help me!

411
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:28,963
什么?哇，你怎么做到的…
What? Wow, how did you do...

412
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:30,847
这是非常错误的，但我对此印象深刻。
That is very wrong, but I'm impressed by that.

413
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:32,425
我的大腿麻了。
Can't feel my thigh.

414
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:35,512
好吧，让我们试试更简单的方法。
Okay, let's try something simpler.

415
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:36,721
近景魔术。
Close-up magic.

416
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:39,474
这被称为假转移。
This is called a false transfer.

417
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:42,060
你以为我把它放在左手里了吗?
You think I put it in my left hand.

418
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:44,104
这是我的权利。
It's in my right.

419
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:45,814
好吧?让我们试一试。
Okay? Let's try it.

420
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,483
坏的。非常糟糕。
Bad. Very bad.

421
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:49,567
坏的。
Bad.

422
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:52,362
内特，那很好。
Nate, that's pretty good.

423
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:54,197
卡在我喉咙里了。
It's stuck in my throat.

424
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:58,451
等等，你是认真的吗?有人知道海姆利克急救法吗?
Wait, are you serious? Does anyone know the Heimlich?

425
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:00,203
没有?护士!
No? Nurse!

426
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:07,794
欢迎来到操控庄园。
Okay, welcome to manipulation manor.

427
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:11,381
显然，蓬松的红球太复杂了，
Obviously, fluffy red balls are too complicated,

428
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:14,217
所以让我们来做一些基本的动物处理。
so let's work on some basic animal handling.

429
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:18,263
甚至与魔法无关，只是简单的宠物-动物园级别的交互。
Not even magic-related, just simple petting-zoo-level interactions.

430
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:21,933
哈!那臭鼬的名字叫弗雷德。
Ha! That skunk's name is Fred.

431
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:23,226
这是疯狂的有趣。
That's crazy funny.

432
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:27,105
这里的56只动物都由一个人照管吗?
Does one person care for all 56 animals here?

433
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:29,149
-有多少动物?-是的。
- Is that how many animals there are? - Yeah.

434
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:31,109
——是的。-你怎么知道的?
- Yes. - How'd you know that?

435
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:32,569
——这是显而易见的。——人!
- It's obvious. - Guys!

436
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:34,279
谁在乎有多少动物?
Who cares how many animals there are?

437
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:40,285
为什么这些可爱的兔子和那些可怕的鸟和蛇在一起?
Why are these adorable bunnies next to those horrifying birds and snakes?

438
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:42,037
更重要的是,
And more importantly,

439
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,456
为什么现在兔子不在我手里?
why aren't the bunnies in my hands right now?

440
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:46,750
是的,露丝。好吧。
Yes, Ruth. All right.

441
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:48,936
自从你来到这里，你就一直在说兔子
All you've talked about since you got here are bunnies,

442
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,172
所以在你的第一个不可能搞砸的练习中，
so for your first impossible-to-mess-up exercise,

443
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:56,760
我只希望你…兔子。
I want you to simply... hold the bunny.

444
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:10,940
你为什么哭?
Why are you crying?

445
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:14,944
它只是那么…可爱。
It's just so... cute.

446
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:16,321
它实际上伤害了。
It actually hurts.

447
00:28:16,404 --> 00:28:19,407
我受不了了。可爱的疼。
I can't stand it. The cuteness hurts.

448
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:23,119
把它放回去。把它放回去!你不敢把它放回去。
Put it back. Put it back! Don't you dare put it back.

449
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:25,622
早上好,露营者。
Good morning, campers.

450
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:28,249
离高帽比赛还有28天。
Twenty-eight days until the Top Hat competition.

451
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:29,417
继续训练。
Keep at your training.

452
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:31,461
今天的午餐很特别…
And today's lunch is a special treat...

453
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:35,382
吃剩的热狗，由拉斯维加斯Weiners World提供。
Leftover hot dogs, courtesy of World Of Weiners, Las Vegas.

454
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:37,842
好,伙计们。很神奇的。
Great job, guys. Amazing.

455
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,470
为什么安迪不那样教我们?
Why doesn't Andy teach us like that?

456
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:42,753
为什么每个人都有自己的机舱t恤呢?
And why does everyone else get their own cabin T-shirts?

457
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:45,058
伙计，我们就差这么一点点就有大卫·布莱恩了。
Man, we were this close to having David Blaine.

458
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:47,102
伙计们，就在这里。
Guys, again, right here.

459
00:28:47,185 --> 00:28:50,146
太好了。你在整个营地的第一个魔术。
Great. Your first magic trick of the whole camp.

460
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,440
对吧?
Right?

461
00:28:52,524 --> 00:28:54,442
你想把它折断。
You wanna snap it.

462
00:28:54,526 --> 00:28:56,194
好吧，我想见你们。
All right, I wanna see you guys.

463
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,490
确保你的手腕有后续动作。好吧,那是更好的。
Make sure you have follow-through with your wrist. Okay, that's better.

464
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:03,618
普雷斯顿,可以…
Preston, can...

465
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:08,873
我们能不能现在不谈这个?
Can we not do this right now?

466
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:10,917
我知道你在这里，普雷斯顿。
I know you're in here, Preston.

467
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:14,129
躲在活板门或隐蔽的角落里，
Hiding in some trapdoor or hidden corner,

468
00:29:14,212 --> 00:29:17,507
等着我转过身，你就会奇迹般地出现，对我说，
waiting for me to turn around so you can magically appear and say,

469
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,910
-“我一直都在这里。”-一直都是。
- "I've been right here the whole time." - the whole time.

470
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:22,012
完全正确。你这么可以预测的。
Exactly. You're so predictable.

471
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:25,223
-有什么问题吗?-问题出在你给我的铺位上
- What's the problem? - The bunk that you gave me is the problem.

472
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:28,560
这些孩子，普雷斯顿，他们都是新来的。他们没有任何技能。
These kids, Preston, they're all newbies. They have zero skills.

473
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:32,355
现在，你明白了，这是一个为想学魔术的孩子们准备的训练营，
Now, you understand that this is a camp for children who wanna learn magic,

474
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:33,648
而你是来教他们的。
and you're here to teach them.

475
00:29:33,732 --> 00:29:35,692
普雷斯顿，这些孩子，他们没救了。
Preston, these kids, they're hopeless.

476
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:37,736
内森被海绵球噎住了。
Nathan choked on a sponge ball.

477
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:41,197
露丝连一只兔子都不敢碰。她喜欢兔子。
Ruth can't even touch a bunny. And she loves bunnies.

478
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:43,366
他们甚至连最基本的纸牌把戏都玩不出来。
They can't even pull off the most basic card trick.

479
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:46,286
但是你看，一个你不相信的把戏是把戏，
But you see, a trick that you don't believe is a trick,

480
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:47,579
这是最好的技巧。
that's the best trick of all.

481
00:29:47,662 --> 00:29:49,222
这就是你要给我的建议?
That's the advice you're gonna give me?

482
00:29:49,247 --> 00:29:51,082
只是一些普通的魔法谚语
Just more generic magical proverbs

483
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:54,294
这听起来很有意义，但完全是无稽之谈?
that sound meaningful but are total nonsense?

484
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:57,672
安迪，只有这样才能创造更多的魔法
Andy, the only way to create more magic in the world

485
00:29:57,756 --> 00:30:00,091
不是通过创造更多的魔法。
is not by creating more magic.

486
00:30:00,175 --> 00:30:02,594
——是的。就像这样。-安迪，让我说完
- Yep. Just like that. - Andy, let me finish.

487
00:30:02,677 --> 00:30:03,845
-不，我受够了。——这是…
- No, I'm done. - It's...

488
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:07,474
对不起，普雷斯顿，我受够了。我离开这里。好吧?
I'm sorry, Preston, but I'm done. I'm outta here. Okay?

489
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:11,436
愚蠢的。
Stupid.

490
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:14,314
我做得很好。
I was doing perfectly fine.

491
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:19,069
嗯,不是很好。我在做好事。good-ish。排序的。
Well, not great. I was doing good. Was doing good-ish. Sort of.

492
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,126
我可能错了，
I could be mistaken,

493
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,340
但我记得我看到过一个12岁的孩子用一只手完美地跳法罗牌。
but I think I saw a 12-year-old execute a perfect faro shuffle with one hand.

494
00:30:40,423 --> 00:30:41,591
我只是在鬼混。
I was just fooling around.

495
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:45,804
法罗洗牌是单手最难的纸牌技巧之一，
A faro shuffle is one of the single most difficult card skills with two hands,

496
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:47,972
我想你们只是用了一个。
and you just did it with one, I think.

497
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:50,517
-再来一次。-我不想。
- Do it again. - I don't want to.

498
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,311
——为什么不呢?你做到了。-我害怕。
- Why not? You just did it. - I get scared.

499
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,358
-怕什么?-我不知道。人们看着我。
- Scared of what? - I don't know. People looking at me.

500
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:01,820
无论如何,很愚蠢。只是…
Anyway, it's stupid. Just...

501
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:03,613
你知道那是什么吗?
You know what that is?

502
00:31:03,697 --> 00:31:05,323
这就是怯场。
That is stage fright.

503
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:08,785
进入你的脑海。对于一个魔术师来说，这是一个怪异的地方。
Gets in your head. And that is a freaky place for a magician to be.

504
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:12,747
-你以前也这样吗?——没有。别荒谬。
- It's happened to you before? - No. Don't be ridiculous.

505
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:15,250
虽然，我是一个受欢迎的专业人士。
Although, I am an acclaimed professional.

506
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:19,796
而你，在另一方面，是一个可以做完美的法罗洗牌的业余选手。
You, on the other hand, are a rank amateur who can somehow do a perfect faro shuffle.

507
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:21,464
让我看看。
So let me see it.

508
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:24,443
-就像我说的…-假装我不在这里。别看我。
- Like I said... - Pretend I'm not here. Don't look at me.

509
00:31:24,467 --> 00:31:26,761
保持洗牌。保持牌的移动。好吧?
Keep shuffling. Keep the cards moving. Okay?

510
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:29,681
你从哪里来?
So where you from?

511
00:31:30,765 --> 00:31:32,517
兰开斯特,加州。
Lancaster, California.

512
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,810
这听起来……
That sounds...

513
00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:37,564
实际上，这听起来很无聊。我不会骗你的。
That sounds boring, actually. I'm not gonna lie to you.

514
00:31:37,647 --> 00:31:39,983
没关系。可能有点无聊。
It's okay. Maybe a little boring.

515
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:43,903
我们住在爱德华兹空军基地附近。很多军人家庭。
We live near Edwards Air Force Base. Lot of military families.

516
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,905
你爸爸在服役吗?
Is your dad in the service?

517
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:47,365
他是。
He was.

518
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:50,952
这些是他的卡片。
Um, these were his cards.

519
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:55,957
嘿!你有兄弟姐妹吗?
Hey! Do you have any brothers or sisters?

520
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:59,669
我有个小弟弟叫卡梅隆。他是最坏的打算。
I have a little brother named Cameron. He's the worst.

521
00:31:59,753 --> 00:32:02,130
——超级烦人吗?——是的,完全。
- Super annoying? - Yeah, totally.

522
00:32:02,547 --> 00:32:05,842
老兄,你很棒。让我看看你的套路。
Dude, you're great. Show me your routine.

523
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:09,387
好吧。拿张卡就行了。
Okay. Um, just take a card.

524
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:12,724
好吧。
All right.

525
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:14,309
现在帮我把它放在最上面。
Now put it on top for me.

526
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:16,144
好吧。
Okay.

527
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,021
,嗯…
And, um...

528
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:23,943
嘿,放松。
Hey, relax.

529
00:32:24,027 --> 00:32:26,112
只有你和我。
It's just you and me.

530
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:27,822
好吧,再试一次。
Okay, try again.

531
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:31,951
放松。
Relax.

532
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:34,162
只有你和我。
It's just you and me.

533
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:41,920
好，方块3。
Okay, three of diamonds.

534
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:45,799
“凯?把它放进去。
'Kay? Just gonna put that in there.

535
00:32:45,882 --> 00:32:48,426
-现在你能帮我把它塞进去吗?——确定。
- Now can you just tuck it in for me? - Sure.

536
00:32:51,888 --> 00:32:53,056
这是你的卡吗?
Is this your card?

537
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:55,934
我的上帝,西奥!
My God, Theo!

538
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:57,644
你是惊人的。
You are amazing.

539
00:32:58,269 --> 00:33:00,021
不，我只是知道一些技巧。
Nah, I just know some tricks.

540
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:02,065
不，你是个魔术师。
No, you are a magician.

541
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:05,402
——谢谢。-我能搞定的。
- Thanks. - I can work with this.

542
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:07,529
可惜你的同屋都没用。
Too bad your bunkmates are so useless.

543
00:33:07,612 --> 00:33:11,991
内森是个数字天才，而贾德知道很多…
Nathan is a genius with numbers, and Judd knows a lot about...

544
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:15,203
我们现在得去你的铺位好好谈谈。我们走吧。来吧。
We need to have a little talk with your bunk right now. Let's go. Come on.

545
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,788
伙计们,嘿。
Guys, hey.

546
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:20,166
如果我告诉你我们至少有机会了呢
What if I told you we have at least some semblance of a shot

547
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,668
赢得高顶帽比赛?
to win the Top Hat competition?

548
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:24,045
我得说我的血糖非常低。
I'd say my blood sugar is really low.

549
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:28,091
不,我是认真的。西奥显然是个秘密红衣主教
No, I'm serious. Theo is apparently a secret Cardini,

550
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:31,803
他告诉我，你们没有我想的那么烂。
and he tells me that you guys don't suck half as bad as I thought.

551
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:35,598
我觉得很难相信，但别把他当成骗子。
Which I find hard to believe, but let's not make a liar out of him.

552
00:33:35,682 --> 00:33:38,518
你是在耍我们是在惩罚我们对魔法的精通吗?
Are you messing with us as a punishment for being awful at magic?

553
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:41,771
我是认真的。作为三次金棒冠军和…
I'm serious. As a three-time Golden Wand winner and...

554
00:33:41,855 --> 00:33:44,065
等待。你赢得了金魔杖?
Wait. You won the Golden Wand?

555
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:45,817
我们听到。现在我们可以吃饭了吗?
We've heard. Now can we eat?

556
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:49,029
-马上。我解决你。-你能在我们吃饭的时候称呼我们吗?
- In a second. I'm addressing you. - Can you address us while we eat?

557
00:33:49,112 --> 00:33:52,991
不,不。这整个激动人心的演讲是我先想象出来的。
No, no. I had envisioned this whole rousing speech thing first.

558
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:56,703
在你教我们之前，你不能做所有的振奋人心的演讲。
You don't get to do the whole rousing speech thing until you teach us stuff.

559
00:33:56,786 --> 00:33:58,705
好吧,公平点。但请听我说完。
Okay, fair point. But hear me out.

560
00:33:58,788 --> 00:34:01,875
如果我们能找到你不太臭的地方，
If we can find the areas where you don't totally stink,

561
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:05,086
我可以把你们训练成像样的魔术师。
I can train you to be sort of decent magicians.

562
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:09,841
有了西奥的技术，我们也许能打败黑木队。
And with Theo's skills, we might actually be able to beat Darkwood.

563
00:34:10,592 --> 00:34:13,720
我的意思是，赢得高顶帽比赛!
I mean, win the Top Hat competition!

564
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:15,096
我是谁?
Who's with me?

565
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:18,892
好了，这就是你们开始说“安迪!安迪!”
Okay, this is where you guys start going, "Andy! Andy!"

566
00:34:18,975 --> 00:34:20,518
如果我们说好，我们能吃吗?
If we say yes, can we eat?

567
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:22,896
——是的!——好的。
- Yes! - Okay.

568
00:34:22,979 --> 00:34:26,608
——最后。-加油吧。我们有工作要做。
- Finally. - Let's fuel up. We got work to do.

569
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:28,109
走向我。
Walk towards me.

570
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:31,488
不要太僵硬，好吗?自然地行走。
Not so stiff, okay? Walk naturally.

571
00:34:31,571 --> 00:34:33,782
握住你的手，就好像你的手是空的。
Hold your hands as if they're actually empty.

572
00:34:35,992 --> 00:34:39,579
现在它们实际上是空的。来吧,伙计们。这是手掌101。
Now they are actually empty. Come on, guys. This is Palming 101.

573
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:42,999
内森，别告诉我你对Tsum过敏。
Nathan, don't tell me you're allergic to Tsum Tsums.

574
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:45,126
不。但我对灰尘过敏。
No. But I'm allergic to dirt.

575
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:49,631
好了，伙计们，我们要让紧身衣更上一层楼。
Okay, guys, we are taking it to the next level with straitjackets.

576
00:34:49,714 --> 00:34:52,342
你知道，这真的很好。有点像拥抱。
You know, this is nice, actually. It's kind of like a hug.

577
00:34:52,884 --> 00:34:55,345
-是的，不是吗?-嘿，安迪，你能帮我再申请一次吗?
- It is, isn't it? - Hey, Andy, could you reapply for me?

578
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:57,472
是的。是啊，我抓住你了，伙计。
Yeah. Yeah, I got you, bud.

579
00:34:58,181 --> 00:34:59,241
——谢谢。-告诉我什么时候。
- Thank you. - Tell me when.

580
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:00,266
这很好。
That's good.

581
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,351
——你好吗?——是的。
- You good? - Yes.

582
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:03,436
-这不可能。-不，不是。
- This is impossible. - No, it isn't.

583
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,358
胡迪尼曾经说过:“我的大脑是让我获得自由的钥匙。”
Houdini once said, "My brain is the key that sets me free."

584
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:09,693
胡迪尼爱尔兰吗?
Was Houdini Irish?

585
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:11,629
不，他是匈牙利人。那是个坏印象。
No, he was Hungarian. That was a bad impression.

586
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:16,658
好了，完全呼气，然后用这个放松的时间将手臂一直伸到后面。
Okay, exhale fully, then use that slack to reach your arm all the way back.

587
00:35:17,325 --> 00:35:19,119
喔!
Whoo.

588
00:35:19,202 --> 00:35:21,454
好吧!现在你明白了。高5。
All right! Now you're getting it. High five.

589
00:35:22,205 --> 00:35:23,415
当然可以。
Of course.

590
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:25,667
——哦。-那是我的错。
- Ooh. - That is my bad.

591
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:27,585
是的!
Yes!

592
00:35:27,669 --> 00:35:29,629
现在我可以和兔子们一起工作了吗?
Now do I get to work with the bunnies?

593
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:32,507
露丝，你还没准备好做兔子呢。
Ruth, you are nowhere near bunny-ready.

594
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,884
你为什么要这样搅乱我的情绪?
Why are you messing with my emotions like this?

595
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:38,430
在你跑之前，你得学会爬。
Well, before you run, you gotta learn how to crawl.

596
00:35:38,513 --> 00:35:42,100
这让我想到……海龟。
Which leads me to... the turtles.

597
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:45,395
又小又慢，就像你们一样。来吧，拿一个。
Tiny and slow, just like you guys. Go ahead, grab one.

598
00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:48,481
兔子桩!我准备好拥抱了!
Bunny pile! I'm ready for my cuddles!

599
00:35:48,565 --> 00:35:50,316
到我这里来，我的朋友们!
Come to me, my friends!

600
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,526
得到他们!很快!
Get 'em! Quickly!

601
00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:53,111
露丝!不!
Ruth! No!

602
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:54,529
-把乌龟扔了。——回来!
- Drop the turtles. - Come back!

603
00:35:54,612 --> 00:35:57,032
——不!他们得到了!-你要去哪里?
- No! They're getting out! - Where are you going?

604
00:35:57,115 --> 00:35:59,868
在盒子里。抓住一只兔子!每个人，每个人，快抓住他们。
In the box. Grab a bunny! Everybody, everybody, just get 'em.

605
00:35:59,951 --> 00:36:01,661
-你要去哪里?-去拿兔子!
- Where are you going? - Get the bunnies!

606
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:05,540
呼气放松。把你的胳膊举过肩膀。
Exhale to create some slack. Get your arm up over your shoulder.

607
00:36:05,623 --> 00:36:06,958
让他们离水远点!
Keep 'em away from the water!

608
00:36:07,042 --> 00:36:10,003
在那里!
Over there!

609
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:11,087
人失望!
Man down!

610
00:36:11,796 --> 00:36:14,674
好吧，这是一个我们不用担心大礼帽的小屋。
Well, that's one cabin we don't have to worry about for Top Hat.

611
00:36:15,842 --> 00:36:18,011
维克，我怎么跟你说的?是一个好去处。
Vic, what did I tell you? Be nice.

612
00:36:19,971 --> 00:36:21,222
停止那些兔子!
Stop those bunnies!

613
00:36:21,306 --> 00:36:23,641
——电子战。恶心。——得到他们!
- Ew. Gross. - Get 'em!

614
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:25,602
——在那里!-是啊，我刚才尖叫了。
- Over there! - Yeah, I just screamed that.

615
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:28,688
-注意你的紧身衣。-他们要跑了!
- Concentrate on your straitjackets. - They're getting away!

616
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:31,066
——詹妮尔在哪?——可怜的。抓兔子。
- Where's Janelle? - Pathetic. Grab the bunny.

617
00:36:31,149 --> 00:36:33,610
你为什么要逃避我?
Why are you running from me?

618
00:36:34,027 --> 00:36:35,111
我有一个!
I got one!

619
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:37,614
——等待。不,我没有……-在灌木丛下面!
- Wait. No, I didn't... - Under the bush!

620
00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:39,866
明白了!
Gotcha!

621
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,868
不,不要!
No, don't go!

622
00:36:41,951 --> 00:36:44,371
我只是在找跑掉的兔子。
I'm just looking for the bunnies that got away.

623
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:47,207
-我看起来像兔子吗?——什么?不。
- Do I look like a bunny? - What? No.

624
00:36:47,749 --> 00:36:51,419
嗯，可能有一点。我是说，像兔子一样可爱。
Well, maybe a little. I mean, like, cute like a bunny.

625
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:54,839
嗯,不是cute-cute。并不是说你不可爱。
Well, not cute-cute. Not that you're not cute.

626
00:36:54,923 --> 00:36:58,927
他不肯骗受害人，所以我把他的手机塞进了一大口。
He wouldn't trick the Vic, so I palmed his phone into a Big Gulp.

627
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:02,889
你是怎么弄到钻石的?你看起来不错。
How'd you get with the Diamonds anyway? You seem nice.

628
00:37:02,972 --> 00:37:05,767
我父母可能为我和黑木乐队在一起付了额外的钱。
My parents probably paid extra for me to be with Darkwood.

629
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,227
他们真是太酷了。
That's pretty cool of them.

630
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,187
他们并不是想耍酷。
They're not trying to be cool.

631
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:12,524
他们只是不想让我妨碍他们繁忙的工作。
They just don't want me getting in the way of their busy work schedule.

632
00:37:14,484 --> 00:37:16,194
-嘿，那是詹妮尔吗?-是的。
- Hey, is that Janelle? - Yeah.

633
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:19,280
-她太奇怪了。-我得走了。
- She's so weird. - Um, I gotta bounce.

634
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:22,742
我看见你脱下了紧身衣。你是怎么做到的?
I saw you get out of that straitjacket. How did you do that?

635
00:37:22,826 --> 00:37:25,328
我不知道。只是好玩。
I don't know. It's just fun.

636
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:27,831
就像你对你的身体做的拼图，我猜。
Like a puzzle you do with your body, I guess.

637
00:37:29,332 --> 00:37:31,751
好了，现在我真的得走了。
Okay, now I really gotta go.

638
00:37:31,835 --> 00:37:33,878
顺便说一下，我叫詹妮尔。
I'm Janelle, by the way.

639
00:37:34,713 --> 00:37:35,714
西奥。
Theo.

640
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,302
离高顶礼帽还有17天。
Seventeen days until Top Hat.

641
00:37:41,386 --> 00:37:43,013
午餐是砂锅菜。
Lunch will be casserole.

642
00:37:43,096 --> 00:37:44,806
目前还不清楚是哪种类型。
It is unclear what kind.

643
00:37:44,889 --> 00:37:48,560
这就是我们所说的法式降酒。你看到了什么?
This is what we call the French drop. You see?

644
00:37:48,643 --> 00:37:51,563
你得保护角度不让观众看到。
You got to protect the angle from the audience.

645
00:37:51,646 --> 00:37:53,126
——噢,噢。-好吧，你们试试看。
- Ooh, ooh. - All right, you guys try.

646
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:58,153
令人惊讶的是，这并不可怕，露丝。
That was surprisingly not terrible, Ruth.

647
00:37:58,236 --> 00:37:59,446
谢谢你,安迪。
Thanks, Andy.

648
00:38:05,577 --> 00:38:06,870
干得好,安迪。
Attaboy, Andy.

649
00:38:06,953 --> 00:38:11,082
看来你们一直在听我精彩的教学。
Seems like you guys have been listening to my amazing teaching after all.

650
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:13,710
魔术并不是一种有氧运动。
Magic isn't exactly a cardio workout.

651
00:38:13,793 --> 00:38:17,714
你的父母坚持让你在这个夏天进行体育锻炼
Your parents are insisting we try to get you some physical activity this summer,

652
00:38:17,797 --> 00:38:18,965
所以…看起来有生机。
so... look alive.

653
00:38:24,012 --> 00:38:26,514
好的,锻炼结束了!回到魔法!
Okay, workout over! Back to magic!

654
00:38:26,598 --> 00:38:30,810
消失……和外观!
Vanish... and appearance!

655
00:38:31,811 --> 00:38:33,730
哇。好工作。
Wow. Good job.

656
00:38:34,814 --> 00:38:38,526
好吧，我想我们该进入下一个阶段了。
Okay, I think it's time we take things to the next level.

657
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:39,652
哇!
Whoa!

658
00:38:39,736 --> 00:38:42,989
什么?我说我想和兔子一起工作，
What? I said I wanted to work with bunnies,

659
00:38:43,073 --> 00:38:45,992
不是那些可怕的，会飞的便便机。
not those terrifying, flying poop-machines.

660
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:48,536
鲁斯，你解放了所有的兔子，
Well, Ruth, you liberated all of the bunnies,

661
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,373
这就是我们要解决的问题。
so this is what we have to work with.

662
00:38:51,456 --> 00:38:52,874
举起你的手指。
Raise out your finger.

663
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:56,461
鸽子就像会飞的兔子。
Doves are like flying bunnies.

664
00:38:56,544 --> 00:38:59,172
它们是魔术师情感的延伸。
They're an extension of a magician's emotions.

665
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:02,050
如果你自信，那就是自信。如果你紧张……
If you're confident, it's confident. If you're nervous...

666
00:39:02,133 --> 00:39:03,593
哇!
Whoa!

667
00:39:05,136 --> 00:39:06,596
然后发生的事情。
Then that happens.

668
00:39:11,476 --> 00:39:13,019
很明显，这也是事实。
And apparently so does that.

669
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:14,270
好的,心。
Okay, Hearts.

670
00:39:14,354 --> 00:39:20,151
我想你已经准备好聆听魔术界最大的秘密之一了。
I think you're ready to hear one of the biggest secrets in all of magic.

671
00:39:20,235 --> 00:39:23,655
每个伟大魔术师的背后，都有……
Behind every great magician, there is...

672
00:39:23,738 --> 00:39:25,907
一个更好的裁缝。
An even better tailor.

673
00:39:27,492 --> 00:39:30,412
——好。那件运动外套真棒。
- Nice. - That sports coat is amazing.

674
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:35,000
贾德，我感觉到人们对服装的热情了吗?
Judd, am I sensing an enthusiasm for costumes?

675
00:39:38,128 --> 00:39:42,716
欢迎来到服装设计的奇妙世界。
Welcome to the fabulous world of costume design.

676
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:48,304
如果你不介意的话，我想今天剩下的时间我还是在这里度过吧。
Think I'm gonna spend the rest of the day here, if that's cool with you.

677
00:39:48,805 --> 00:39:50,974
露丝，也许你需要大点的。
Ruth, maybe you just need something bigger.

678
00:39:53,518 --> 00:39:55,395
伊森，她不是食物，好吗?
Now, Ethan, she's not food, okay?

679
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,447
哇。
Whoa.

680
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:08,700
鹰现在是我的最爱了。
Hawks are my thing now.

681
00:40:08,783 --> 00:40:12,078
鸟儿喜欢绿色。这就像……你就像一棵树。
Birds love the color green. It's like... It's like you're a tree.

682
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,418
好吧，跟我来。
All right, come with me.

683
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:23,715
嗨,爸爸。我有一个新把戏。
Hey, Dad. I got a new trick.

684
00:40:23,798 --> 00:40:26,176
我现在不行，西奥。我赶不上飞机了。
I-I can't right now, Theo. I'm late for my flight.

685
00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:29,512
-为你妈妈做。-妈妈不喜欢魔法。好吗?
- Do it for your mom. - Mom's not into magic. Please?

686
00:40:30,263 --> 00:40:32,974
-是的。好吧。好吧。——好的。
- Yeah. Okay. Okay. - All right.

687
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:34,476
选择一个卡。
Pick a card.

688
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:35,935
好了。
There we go.

689
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:38,730
好吧。别让我看这是红桃j。
All right. Now don't let me see it's the jack of hearts.

690
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,067
好吧。
Okay.

691
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,777
这很好。你怎么知道的?
That's pretty good. How'd you know?

692
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,862
因为那是我。我是红心j。
'Cause that's me. I'm the jack of hearts.

693
00:40:45,945 --> 00:40:49,407
和…这是你的。
And... that's you.

694
00:40:50,575 --> 00:40:53,161
-你是红心之王。-你是怎么做到的…
- You're the king of hearts. - How did you do...

695
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:55,163
这是难以置信的。你是不可思议的,西奥。
That's incredible. You're incredible, Theo.

696
00:40:55,246 --> 00:40:57,499
西奥。西奥。
Theo. Theo.

697
00:40:57,582 --> 00:41:01,169
听着，每个人的行为都在成形，但我们都还没有。
Look, everyone's acts are shaping up, but neither of us have one yet.

698
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:04,839
所以我想我们可以组成一个魔术喜剧二人组
So I was thinking we could form a magical comedy duo

699
00:41:04,923 --> 00:41:09,135
与我做勇敢的玩笑，而你wow每个人与你的卡魔术。
with me doing plucky banter while you wow everyone with your card magic.

700
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:12,472
我读到过放屁的声音很能取悦大众。
I've read that fart sounds are quite the crowd-pleaser.

701
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:16,643
你再偷偷给我一点奶酪，我就把这个地方的屋顶炸飞。
You sneak me even a bit of cheese, and I will blow the roof off this place.

702
00:41:16,726 --> 00:41:19,562
-内特，千万别在人群上放屁——好的。
- Nate, definitely don't fart on the crowd. - Okay.

703
00:41:19,646 --> 00:41:22,023
你们为什么不工作?演出在下周举行。
Why aren't you guys working? The show's next week.

704
00:41:22,107 --> 00:41:24,109
我还在努力学习我的专业。
I'm still trying to figure out my specialty.

705
00:41:24,192 --> 00:41:26,736
是的，这是个棘手的问题。
Yeah, that is a tricky one.

706
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,322
内特，这个电影院有几张票?
Hey, Nate, how many seats are in this theater?

707
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:31,991
273. 为什么?
273. Why?

708
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:34,869
为什么?因为你这么快就能做到。
Why? Because it's freakish how quickly you could do that.

709
00:41:34,953 --> 00:41:37,038
你有别人没有的特别的东西。
You've got something special that no one else has.

710
00:41:37,622 --> 00:41:41,543
突出的尾骨实际上比你想象的更常见。
A protruding tailbone is actually more common than you'd expect.

711
00:41:41,626 --> 00:41:43,688
他说的是你计算东西的方式。
He's talking about the way you do your counting stuff.

712
00:41:43,712 --> 00:41:48,133
是的，我只是数。我数，组，乘，还有…
Yeah, I just count. I count and group and multiply and...

713
00:41:48,216 --> 00:41:49,718
这是魔法。
That's magic.

714
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:53,722
你的大脑就像一个巨大的、怪异的魔法计算器。
Your brain is like a big, weird magic calculator.

715
00:41:53,805 --> 00:41:56,057
你可能是个唯心论者。
You could be a mentalist.

716
00:41:56,141 --> 00:41:57,392
喜欢用黑木制作克里斯吗?
Like Kris Darkwood?

717
00:41:57,475 --> 00:41:59,644
比克里斯·多克伍德还好。
Better than Kris Dorkwood.

718
00:42:00,145 --> 00:42:02,355
-我需要坐下来——你。
- I need to sit down. - You are.

719
00:42:13,324 --> 00:42:14,659
很好。
Very nice.

720
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:17,871
看上去不错,伙计们。哇!
Looking good, guys. Whoo!

721
00:42:17,954 --> 00:42:19,956
-安迪，过来。——好的。
- Andy, come here. - Okay.

722
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:22,959
哇。
Whoa.

723
00:42:24,294 --> 00:42:25,295
是的。
Yep.

724
00:42:26,379 --> 00:42:28,673
——好。是的!-看起来不错。
- Good. Yes! - That looked so good.

725
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:31,676
西奥，让我们看看你的本事。
Okay, Theo, show us what you got.

726
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:41,644
——难以置信。-好吧，我们休息十分钟。
- Unbelievable. - Okay, let's take ten.

727
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,481
伙计们，继续练习你的小指。
You guys, keep working on your pinky break.

728
00:42:44,564 --> 00:42:46,358
内森，让你的小指休息一下。
Nathan, give your pinky a break.

729
00:42:46,983 --> 00:42:50,320
-那是痒，不是刺。我发誓。-好吧，很好。
- It was an itch, not a pick. I swear. - Okay, yeah, cool, all right.

730
00:42:50,403 --> 00:42:52,739
伙计，怎么回事?你还在你的脑子里。
Dude, what's going on? You're still in your head.

731
00:42:53,198 --> 00:42:55,468
你知道吗?跟我来。有些东西你需要看。
You know what? Follow me. There's something you need to see.

732
00:42:55,492 --> 00:42:56,743
来吧。
Come on.

733
00:43:01,873 --> 00:43:03,667
普雷斯顿的秘密图书馆。
Preston's secret library.

734
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:06,628
当我像你这么大的时候，他把我带到这里。
He took me here when I was about your age.

735
00:43:06,711 --> 00:43:09,964
他说只有真正杰出的魔术师才能参加。
He said it was for only truly exceptional magicians.

736
00:43:10,799 --> 00:43:12,425
去看看吧。
Go ahead, check it out.

737
00:43:28,024 --> 00:43:29,526
这是一个猫头鹰。
It's an owl.

738
00:43:33,905 --> 00:43:35,448
是你和黑木吗?
Is that you and Darkwood?

739
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:38,201
哇。
Wow.

740
00:43:38,827 --> 00:43:39,828
是的。
Yep.

741
00:43:40,662 --> 00:43:43,623
-对，就是我们。——“Abraca-Duo”?
- Yeah, that's us. - The "Abraca-Duo"?

742
00:43:43,707 --> 00:43:47,210
嘿,别法官。这在当时是一个非常容易记住的名字。
Hey, don't judge. It was a very catchy name at the time.

743
00:43:48,086 --> 00:43:50,088
那么，你们现在为什么讨厌对方呢?
So, why do you hate each other now?

744
00:43:52,966 --> 00:43:54,217
哇。嗯…
Wow. Um...

745
00:43:55,093 --> 00:43:57,053
当我们还是露营者的时候，我们很亲密。
When we were campers, we were close.

746
00:43:57,137 --> 00:43:58,763
我对你下了咒语
♪ I put a spell on you ♪

747
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,098
我很酷…
I was like the cool...

748
00:44:00,181 --> 00:44:01,683
训练营的老巨星
older superstar of the camp

749
00:44:01,766 --> 00:44:04,060
她是我的门生。
and she was kinda my protégée.

750
00:44:05,061 --> 00:44:07,480
因为你是我的
♪ Because you're mine ♪

751
00:44:09,607 --> 00:44:11,526
放学后，我们成了伙伴。
After school, we became partners.

752
00:44:11,609 --> 00:44:13,737
一开始，我们只是做了很多街头魔术。
At first, we just did a lot of street magic.

753
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,321
停止你所做的事情
♪ Stop the things you do ♪

754
00:44:15,405 --> 00:44:18,950
但是消息传开了，很快我们就预订了真正的演出。
But word got around and pretty soon we were booking real gigs.

755
00:44:19,951 --> 00:44:22,871
我不是吹牛，但我们在一起真的很棒。
Not to brag, but we were pretty amazing together.

756
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:29,586
我知道这有点难以置信，但我们确实曾经是一对。
I know it's kinda hard to believe, but we actually used to be a couple.

757
00:44:29,669 --> 00:44:31,713
很明显。
It's obvious.

758
00:44:33,423 --> 00:44:36,926
我是说，你看得出她对你还有感觉。
I mean, you can tell she still has feelings for you.

759
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,470
-我知道，对吧?-是的。
- I know, right? - Yeah.

760
00:44:38,553 --> 00:44:40,680
就像，忘记它，你知道吗?
It's like, get over it, you know?

761
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:46,061
不管怎样，我们开始制作越来越大的影院，
Anyway, we started doing bigger and bigger theaters,

762
00:44:46,144 --> 00:44:47,937
想在维加斯有自己的演出
trying to get our own show in Vegas.

763
00:44:48,813 --> 00:44:52,275
然后她背着我走了。
Then she went behind my back.

764
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:54,736
没带我去见一个大电视制作人。
Took a meeting with a big TV booker without me.

765
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:59,282
我发现后，我们大吵了一架，然后分手了。
When I found out, we got in this huge fight and we broke up.

766
00:44:59,657 --> 00:45:03,370
她做了电视独唱，一夜成名。
She did the solo TV gig and skyrocketed to fame.

767
00:45:04,287 --> 00:45:07,374
我也开始独奏，但是…
I also started to perform solo, but...

768
00:45:10,251 --> 00:45:13,755
这是粗糙的。
It was rough.

769
00:45:14,756 --> 00:45:18,051
一天晚上，我只为一个人做了一个节目……托尼。
One night I did a show for just one person... Tony.

770
00:45:18,677 --> 00:45:20,261
那天早些时候他修理了我的车。
He worked on my car earlier that day.

771
00:45:20,345 --> 00:45:22,889
你能想象为一个人施魔法吗?
Can you imagine just doing magic for one person?

772
00:45:22,972 --> 00:45:27,185
我能。这就是我施魔法的原因。为我的爸爸。
I can. That's why I did magic. For my dad.

773
00:45:29,521 --> 00:45:31,189
我只会为他表演。
I'd only perform for him.

774
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,025
但现在，他…
But now, he's, um...

775
00:45:36,986 --> 00:45:38,697
——他……-嘿，没事的。
- He... - Hey, it's okay.

776
00:45:40,281 --> 00:45:42,200
我们现在不需要谈这个。
We don't have to talk about that now.

777
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:44,494
快点，我们离开这里。
Come on, let's get out of here.

778
00:45:54,963 --> 00:45:56,881
——要去哪里吗?-让我出去。
- Going somewhere? - Let me out.

779
00:45:57,382 --> 00:46:01,261
你整个夏天都在练习，在练习前偷偷溜走。
You've been pulling this all summer, sneaking away before practice.

780
00:46:01,344 --> 00:46:03,471
你知道是你自己选择来的吗?
You know you chose to come here?

781
00:46:03,555 --> 00:46:05,974
不是真的。我从来没施过魔法。
Not really. I've never even done magic before.

782
00:46:06,057 --> 00:46:08,727
-我父母刚把我送走。——我很抱歉。
- My parents just sent me away. - I'm sorry.

783
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:10,270
那真的不公平。
That's really not fair.

784
00:46:10,353 --> 00:46:12,230
好吧，你懂的。放我出去。
Okay, you get it. So let me out.

785
00:46:12,313 --> 00:46:13,732
可以这样做。
Could do that.

786
00:46:13,815 --> 00:46:17,152
但如果你选择把整个夏天看作是一种挑战呢?
But what if you chose to look at this whole summer as a kind of challenge?

787
00:46:17,235 --> 00:46:19,738
就像绑着这张网的蟒蛇一样。
Like that constrictor knot holding this net.

788
00:46:19,821 --> 00:46:20,822
你是什么意思?
What do you mean?

789
00:46:20,905 --> 00:46:24,159
你被困在这里了，就像你被困在这张网里一样。
Well, you're stuck here at camp, just like you're stuck in this net.

790
00:46:24,242 --> 00:46:27,120
你没有选择任何一种情况，但它们确实发生了。
You didn't choose either situation, but they happened.

791
00:46:27,579 --> 00:46:28,788
所以，你有两个选择。
So, you have two options.

792
00:46:28,872 --> 00:46:33,543
你可以继续不开心，被困住，或者你可以做些什么来改变它。
You can continue being unhappy and stuck, or you can do something about it.

793
00:46:34,044 --> 00:46:35,462
改变你的处境。
Change your situation.

794
00:46:35,545 --> 00:46:38,089
我已经见识过你那件紧身衣的威力了。
I've seen what you can do with that straitjacket.

795
00:46:48,183 --> 00:46:50,060
——哇!——哇!
- Whoa! - Whoa!

796
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:53,646
哈!
Ha!

797
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:55,315
美好的一天,露营者。
Good day, campers.

798
00:46:55,398 --> 00:46:58,443
还有5天就要参加高帽比赛了。
Just five days until the Top Hat competition.

799
00:46:58,526 --> 00:47:01,613
但是记住，你们不是在和别人竞争，而是在和你们自己竞争。
But remember, you are not competing with each other, but yourselves.

800
00:47:01,696 --> 00:47:02,906
还有彼此。
And also each other.

801
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:06,409
如发现有松动的兔子，请向维修人员报告。
Please report any loose bunny sightings to the maintenance staff.

802
00:47:07,077 --> 00:47:08,370
午餐将是兔子。
Lunch will be rabbit.

803
00:47:09,204 --> 00:47:11,206
在开玩笑。火腿沙拉。
Kidding. Ham salad.

804
00:47:13,875 --> 00:47:16,670
-你们在干嘛?-我们在这里等你。
- Um, what are you guys doing? - We're waiting here for you.

805
00:47:16,753 --> 00:47:21,174
我有好消息和坏消息要告诉你。
I've got some great news and some less-than-great news.

806
00:47:21,257 --> 00:47:23,259
我想我知道如何治好你的怯场。
I think I know how to cure your stage fright.

807
00:47:23,343 --> 00:47:26,054
这是惊人的。不太好的消息是什么?
That's amazing. What's the less-great news?

808
00:47:26,137 --> 00:47:28,682
它叫做护身符。这可能会变得一团糟。
It's called the gauntlet. And it may get messy.

809
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,684
给我们看一些心脏手术。
Just show us some cardistry.

810
00:47:30,934 --> 00:47:33,103
你以前也为我做过。你可以再做一次。
You did it for me before. You can do it again.

811
00:47:33,186 --> 00:47:34,437
我想我做不到。
I don't think I can.

812
00:47:34,521 --> 00:47:36,523
不要想，就去做。
Don't think, just do it.

813
00:47:36,606 --> 00:47:38,191
做好一切准备。
And be prepared for anything.

814
00:47:38,566 --> 00:47:39,693
我们走吧。告诉我们。
Let's go. Show us.

815
00:47:39,776 --> 00:47:42,445
就是这样。干得好，西奥。
That's it. Yeah, good job, Theo.

816
00:47:42,529 --> 00:47:44,239
露丝,内森,现在。
Ruth, Nathan, now.

817
00:47:45,365 --> 00:47:46,991
两点之间的距离…
The distance between two points...

818
00:47:47,075 --> 00:47:49,244
等于√X 200。
is the square root of X of 200.

819
00:47:49,327 --> 00:47:51,413
嘿，注意点，好吗?
Hey, focus up, okay?

820
00:47:51,496 --> 00:47:53,415
把其他一切都排除在外。只有你和我。
Block everything else out. It's just you and me.

821
00:47:57,544 --> 00:48:01,297
是的,伟大的工作。现在，卷曲成瀑布。正确的。
Yes, great job. Now, friffle into cascade. Right into it.

822
00:48:02,382 --> 00:48:04,009
贾德,维拉,现在!
Judd, Vera, now!

823
00:48:07,053 --> 00:48:09,264
好的，现在查利尔切成L形。
Okay, now charlier into L cuts.

824
00:48:14,853 --> 00:48:16,104
是的!
Yes!

825
00:48:16,187 --> 00:48:18,064
我知道你能做到。
I knew you could do it.

826
00:48:21,234 --> 00:48:22,235
严重吗?
Seriously?

827
00:48:23,737 --> 00:48:26,489
它在。
It's on.

828
00:48:26,573 --> 00:48:28,700
神奇的战斗!
Magic fight!

829
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:38,585
我们得到他!
We got him!

830
00:48:42,881 --> 00:48:44,758
——我……-等等，他去哪了?
- My... - Wait, where'd he go?

831
00:48:44,841 --> 00:48:46,801
他就像一个有魔力的忍者。
He's like a magic ninja.

832
00:48:46,885 --> 00:48:48,511
哈哈!
Ha ha!

833
00:49:00,398 --> 00:49:02,359
你以为你把我带到你想要的地方。
You think you got me where you want me.

834
00:49:02,442 --> 00:49:05,737
但也许我把你带到了我想要你的地方。
But maybe I got you right where I want you.

835
00:49:06,446 --> 00:49:07,697
Alaka-zip-it。
Alaka-zip-it.

836
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:16,456
幸运符?
Lucky Charms?

837
00:49:16,831 --> 00:49:19,250
“他们神奇的美味。”明白了吗?
"They're magically delicious." Get it?

838
00:49:19,334 --> 00:49:20,335
我们得到它。
We get it.

839
00:49:20,418 --> 00:49:22,003
你怎么知道的?
How'd you even know?

840
00:49:22,087 --> 00:49:23,672
因为我是魔法忍者。
Because I am a magic ninja.

841
00:49:23,755 --> 00:49:24,923
我们的衣服都毁了。
Our clothes are ruined.

842
00:49:26,091 --> 00:49:27,717
我想我已经搞定了。
I think I got us covered.

843
00:50:00,583 --> 00:50:04,671
是的，但至少想想。
Yeah, but at least think about it.

844
00:50:05,422 --> 00:50:08,883
只有很短的飞行距离，对吗?好吧,再见。
It's only a short flight away, right? Okay, bye.

845
00:50:10,301 --> 00:50:13,972
嘿，他们终于在雪糕里增加了非乳制品的选择。
Hey, they finally added a nondairy option to the ice cream bar.

846
00:50:14,055 --> 00:50:17,308
看，这是一颗破碎的心。
Look, it's one of the broken Hearts.

847
00:50:17,392 --> 00:50:18,727
你要去哪儿?
Where do you think you're going?

848
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:21,438
我只是想做个不吃冰淇淋的梦。
I was just gonna get some No Cream Ice Dream.

849
00:50:21,521 --> 00:50:23,148
你真的尝不出有什么不同。
You really can't taste the difference.

850
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:26,401
我不知道。看起来你在骗受害人。
I don't know. It looks like you're trying to trick the Vic.

851
00:50:26,484 --> 00:50:29,320
-骗受害人。维克技巧。-不，我不是。
- Trick the Vic. Trick the Vic. - No, I'm not.

852
00:50:29,404 --> 00:50:33,241
你称自己为“受害者”会有点尴尬。
And it's a bit awkward that you refer to yourself as "the Vic."

853
00:50:33,908 --> 00:50:35,118
选择一个卡。
Pick a card.

854
00:50:35,702 --> 00:50:37,120
嗯，我宁愿不要。
Um, I'd rather not.

855
00:50:37,203 --> 00:50:39,873
选择……一个……卡。
Pick... a... card.

856
00:50:40,248 --> 00:50:41,249
”凯。
'Kay.

857
00:50:42,334 --> 00:50:43,501
好的,记住它。
Okay, memorize it.

858
00:50:45,545 --> 00:50:50,008
现在，我将按最好到最坏的顺序发4张a。
Now, I'm going to deal out the four aces in order from best to worst.

859
00:50:50,759 --> 00:50:54,054
钻石,黑桃,梅花,
Diamonds, spades, clubs,

860
00:50:54,137 --> 00:50:58,308
最后也是最不重要的是心。
and, last but also least, hearts.

861
00:50:59,517 --> 00:51:00,977
别忘了你的卡，好吗?
Don't forget your card, okay?

862
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:04,272
我会慢慢来，因为我知道你的心，有点慢。
I'll do this slow 'cause I know you Hearts are, a bit slow.

863
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:11,321
和…繁荣!
And... boom!

864
00:51:11,404 --> 00:51:15,116
你的卡没了。但是，等等，它去哪了?
Your card is gone. But, wait, where'd it go?

865
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,911
这是反问句吗，还是我该回答?
Is that a rhetorical question, or am I supposed to answer it?

866
00:51:17,994 --> 00:51:19,913
打勾，笨蛋。
Check the box, dummy.

867
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:26,044
哇!
Whoa!

868
00:51:26,795 --> 00:51:28,588
我是怎么做到的?
So, how'd I do it?

869
00:51:29,297 --> 00:51:31,591
我不知道。我什么也没得到。
I don't know. I-I got nothing.

870
00:51:31,675 --> 00:51:33,551
什么都没有。
Nothing.

871
00:51:33,635 --> 00:51:36,554
这就是你和其他的心…什么都没有。
That's all you and the rest of the Hearts are... nothing.

872
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,766
维克技巧。维克技巧。
Trick the Vic. Trick the Vic.

873
00:51:39,849 --> 00:51:42,102
-骗受害人。维克技巧。——嘿,维克。
- Trick the Vic. Trick the Vic. - Hey, Vic.

874
00:51:42,185 --> 00:51:43,436
我知道你是怎么做的。
I know how you do it.

875
00:51:44,646 --> 00:51:46,356
-我抓住你了，伙计。——好的。
- I got you, buddy. - Okay.

876
00:51:46,439 --> 00:51:49,651
如果你知道我是怎么做的，那你就做吧。
If you know how I do it, then you do it.

877
00:51:49,734 --> 00:51:52,862
首先，漂亮的牌力要给你复制。
First off, nice card force to your duplicate.

878
00:51:52,946 --> 00:51:56,032
但我不能精确地模拟你是怎么做到的
But I can't do the trick exactly how you did it

879
00:51:56,116 --> 00:52:00,203
因为……我没有双面胶带。
'cause... I don't have double-stick tape.

880
00:52:00,286 --> 00:52:02,539
好了。
Nice.

881
00:52:02,622 --> 00:52:04,040
剧透!
Spoiler alert!

882
00:52:06,209 --> 00:52:07,627
继续工作。
Carry on.

883
00:52:07,711 --> 00:52:09,087
现在，如果我要这么做，
Now, if I was gonna do it,

884
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:13,008
我会拿走一张a，红桃a，
I would've taken one of the aces, the ace of hearts,

885
00:52:13,091 --> 00:52:16,094
我就会把它变成你的名片
and I would've turned it into your card.

886
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:21,224
否则我就会做一个视觉消失。
Or I would've done a visual vanish.

887
00:52:21,975 --> 00:52:23,351
是这样的。
Something like this.

888
00:52:27,856 --> 00:52:30,176
-你教他这个?-我可能帮了一点忙。
- You teach him that? - I may have helped out a little bit.

889
00:52:30,233 --> 00:52:31,234
不错,西奥。
Nice, Theo.

890
00:52:31,317 --> 00:52:33,570
如果我要用一个副本，
And if I was gonna use a duplicate,

891
00:52:33,653 --> 00:52:37,490
我不会让它像纸牌盒那样明显地出现在某个地方。
I wouldn't make it appear somewhere obvious like a card box.

892
00:52:37,574 --> 00:52:40,201
我会让它看起来不可能
I would make it appear somewhere really impossible

893
00:52:40,285 --> 00:52:41,828
比如你裤子的左边口袋。
like your left pants pocket.

894
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:44,122
什么?不可能。
What? No way.

895
00:52:45,915 --> 00:52:48,501
哇!
Whoa!

896
00:52:48,585 --> 00:52:51,463
但那需要一些你没有的东西…
But that would've required something you don't have...

897
00:52:52,172 --> 00:52:53,173
一个朋友。
A friend.

898
00:52:53,256 --> 00:52:55,300
生病的燃烧。
Sick burn.

899
00:52:55,383 --> 00:52:58,887
西奥!西奥!西奥!
Theo! Theo! Theo!

900
00:53:00,722 --> 00:53:02,557
嘿，你在干什么?给那些回来。
Hey, what are you doing? Give those back.

901
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,434
冷静下来,芽。
Chill out, bud.

902
00:53:04,517 --> 00:53:05,894
这是令人印象深刻。
That was impressive.

903
00:53:05,977 --> 00:53:08,104
那么，让我再展示一个技巧。
So, let me show you one more trick.

904
00:53:09,147 --> 00:53:12,150
也许你能告诉我怎么做这个。
Maybe you can tell me how I do this one.

905
00:53:15,904 --> 00:53:17,572
哇!
Whoa!

906
00:53:21,034 --> 00:53:23,244
——哦。——没有。
- Aw. - No.

907
00:53:23,328 --> 00:53:26,247
不,我的卡片!你怎么能对我的牌这么做!
No, my cards! How could you do this to my cards!

908
00:53:26,331 --> 00:53:28,208
——加油!-你为什么要这么做?
- Come on! - Why would you do that?

909
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:30,460
-把他们带回来!不!不!-不酷，维克。
- Bring 'em back! No! No! - Not cool, Vic.

910
00:53:30,919 --> 00:53:33,713
你们都有麻烦了。大家都回到铺位上。
You're all in trouble. Everybody, back to the bunk.

911
00:53:46,768 --> 00:53:49,854
我在床上有一副多余的纸牌。
I've got an extra deck of cards in the bunk.

912
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,149
上面有我的《我的世界》里的头像，
You know, they have photos of my Minecraft avatars on them,

913
00:53:53,233 --> 00:53:56,361
但如果你想要，它们是你的。
but they're yours if you want 'em.

914
00:53:57,487 --> 00:53:59,614
谢谢,但是……
Thanks, but...

915
00:54:01,241 --> 00:54:02,784
那些卡片很特别。
those cards were special.

916
00:54:03,326 --> 00:54:04,828
为什么?
Why?

917
00:54:05,412 --> 00:54:07,247
我爸爸给我的。
My dad gave 'em to me.

918
00:54:14,129 --> 00:54:17,048
他是第一个向我展示魔术的人。
He was the first person to ever show me magic.

919
00:54:18,717 --> 00:54:21,886
我的爸爸,他……他是……
My dad, he... He was...

920
00:54:24,431 --> 00:54:28,059
他……他是……他是伟大的。
He... He was... He was great.

921
00:54:30,228 --> 00:54:32,939
他……他就死了。
He... He died.

922
00:54:33,023 --> 00:54:35,900
和I-I-I……
And I-I-I just...

923
00:54:35,984 --> 00:54:38,278
我真的，真的很想他。
I really, really miss him.

924
00:54:44,451 --> 00:54:48,621
你知道，每个人都希望我成为这个伟大的魔术师。
You know, everyone expects me to be this great magician.

925
00:54:49,581 --> 00:54:51,416
但我不是。
But I'm not.

926
00:54:51,958 --> 00:54:53,793
我想我也不想。
And I don't think I really wanna be.

927
00:54:55,545 --> 00:54:57,297
但我不敢告诉我爸爸。
But I'm afraid to tell my dad that.

928
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:01,760
我说我已知有109种过敏症，
I say I have 109 known allergies,

929
00:55:01,843 --> 00:55:06,264
但是…实际上只有108。
but... it's really only 108.

930
00:55:06,765 --> 00:55:09,100
我不是真的对谷蛋白过敏。
I'm not actually allergic to gluten.

931
00:55:09,809 --> 00:55:13,188
我就是受不了我妈做的俄式牛柳。
I just can't stand my mom's beef stroganoff.

932
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:19,152
露丝，你有什么想说的吗?
Ruth, is there anything you wanna share?

933
00:55:21,321 --> 00:55:24,449
我以前觉得自己很可爱，像兔子一样。
I used to think I was adorable, like a bunny.

934
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:28,870
但现在我像鹰一样嗜血。
But now I have this thirst for blood, like a hawk.

935
00:55:30,121 --> 00:55:32,624
你正在向食物链的上游前进。
You're making your way up the food chain.

936
00:55:32,707 --> 00:55:33,708
为你骄傲。
Proud of you.

937
00:55:33,792 --> 00:55:37,504
哇。维拉，我刚才听到你恭维我了吗?
Whoa. Vera, was that a compliment I just heard?

938
00:55:38,838 --> 00:55:43,009
我的意思是，我对你的厌恶一天比一天少了。
What I meant was, every day, I dislike you a little less.

939
00:55:45,762 --> 00:55:48,932
我不会在世界各地进行私人演出。
I don't perform private shows all over the world.

940
00:55:49,683 --> 00:55:51,976
实际上,或任何地方。
Or anywhere, actually.

941
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:53,978
是啊，我们也算出来了。
Yeah, we kinda figured that.

942
00:55:55,480 --> 00:56:00,694
当我在你们这个年纪的时候，我表演是因为这是世界上最有趣的事情。
When I was your age, I performed because it was the most fun in the world.

943
00:56:01,194 --> 00:56:05,824
我的意思是，这就是我想要的，有我自己的节目，成为那个男人。
I mean, that's all I wanted, to have my own show and be the guy.

944
00:56:07,575 --> 00:56:10,453
然后发生了一件事……
And then something happened...

945
00:56:10,537 --> 00:56:12,080
黑伍德结束了你的伙伴关系。
Darkwood ended your partnership.

946
00:56:12,163 --> 00:56:14,374
-伤透你的心。-让你失去了魔力
- Broke your heart. - Made you lose your mojo.

947
00:56:14,833 --> 00:56:18,169
什么?不。我不会…我不会…嗯…
What? No. I wouldn't... I wouldn't... Um...

948
00:56:18,253 --> 00:56:20,046
不。这不是……
No. That's not...

949
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:22,340
重点是，伙计们，在那之后，
Well, the point is, guys, is that after that,

950
00:56:22,424 --> 00:56:25,260
我不再在舞台上玩了。
I stopped having fun on stage.

951
00:56:26,428 --> 00:56:29,097
观众看我的时候也不再开心了。
And the audience stopped having fun watching me.

952
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:31,433
现在我开出租车。
And now I drive a taxi.

953
00:56:31,516 --> 00:56:33,518
男人。连优步都没有?
Man. Not even an Uber?

954
00:56:33,601 --> 00:56:35,895
我的车不够好。它没有资格。
My car's not nice enough. It didn't qualify.

955
00:56:35,979 --> 00:56:39,232
你刚才提到的那个可爱的挑战者呢?
What about that sweet Challenger you came in?

956
00:56:39,315 --> 00:56:41,317
那是租来的。
That is a rental.

957
00:56:41,401 --> 00:56:42,652
好吧。
Okay.

958
00:56:42,736 --> 00:56:43,737
-是的。——好的。
- Yeah. - Okay.

959
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:46,823
我不得不向爸爸借钱才能租到它。是的。
I had to borrow money from my dad in order to rent it. Yeah.

960
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:48,700
嗯…
Um...

961
00:56:49,743 --> 00:56:54,247
这不是金魔杖，但是个开始。
It's not a Golden Wand, but it's a start.

962
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,041
谢谢,西奥。
Thanks, Theo.

963
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:59,919
下一个技巧，
And for my next trick,

964
00:57:00,003 --> 00:57:03,798
我给大家下了个咒语，让大家不再伤心
I put a spell on all of us to quit being sad

965
00:57:03,882 --> 00:57:06,593
祝你度过最美好的夜晚。
and have the best night ever.

966
00:57:09,054 --> 00:57:11,890
-谢谢，谢谢。-嘿，Theo, Janelle在看你呢。
- Thank you, thank you. - Hey, Theo, Janelle's looking at you.

967
00:57:11,973 --> 00:57:12,974
真的吗?
Really?

968
00:57:13,058 --> 00:57:16,019
你觉得是关于什么的?你觉得她的棉花糖用完了?
What do you think it's about? You think she ran out of marshmallows?

969
00:57:16,102 --> 00:57:19,939
她可能把棉花糖用完了。詹妮尔，我们有棉花糖!
She probably ran out of marshmallows. Hey, Janelle, we have marshmallows!

970
00:57:20,023 --> 00:57:21,358
-冷静，冷静!——为什么?
- Chill out, chill out! - Why?

971
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:24,611
女士们会喜欢你的。
Ooh, lady's gonna like you.

972
00:57:24,694 --> 00:57:27,447
——K-I-S-S-I-N-G。——西奥!
- K-I-S-S-I-N-G. - Theo!

973
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:31,659
西奥喜欢詹妮尔。西奥喜欢詹妮尔。
Theo likes Janelle. Theo likes Janelle.

974
00:57:40,585 --> 00:57:43,814
你打算什么时候把你是专业魔术师的事实说出来?
When were you gonna come clean about the fact that you're a professional magician?

975
00:57:43,838 --> 00:57:44,839
我不是。
I'm not.

976
00:57:45,757 --> 00:57:48,927
-我看见你和维克在一起这是疯狂的。——谢谢。
- I saw you with Vic. That was crazy. - Thanks.

977
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:51,680
是啊，你可能在这神奇的事情上发现了一些东西。
Yeah, you might be onto something with this whole magic thing.

978
00:57:51,763 --> 00:57:53,181
很有趣,对吧?
It's fun, right?

979
00:57:54,849 --> 00:57:56,267
这是有趣的。
This is fun.

980
00:58:03,149 --> 00:58:04,401
每个人都冻结。
Everyone freeze.

981
00:58:07,862 --> 00:58:09,739
露丝，你在做什么?
Ruth, what are you doing?

982
00:58:09,823 --> 00:58:10,990
待回来。
Stay back.

983
00:58:11,074 --> 00:58:13,326
我整个夏天都在为这一刻而训练。
I've been training for this moment all summer.

984
00:58:14,786 --> 00:58:17,997
伙计们，我想那是弗雷德。它一定是从笼子里跑出来的。
Guys, I think that's Fred. He must've gotten out of his cage.

985
00:58:18,081 --> 00:58:21,167
感谢上帝。弗雷德的臭腺被切除了。
Thank God. Fred had his stink glands removed.

986
00:58:21,584 --> 00:58:23,461
但我们还是要带他回去。
But we still need to guide him back.

987
00:58:24,629 --> 00:58:26,506
不要听他们的。
Don't listen to them.

988
00:58:26,589 --> 00:58:27,966
不要看他们。
Don't look at them.

989
00:58:28,925 --> 00:58:31,928
只有你和我。
It's just you and me.

990
00:58:36,266 --> 00:58:38,143
这些看起来不像弗雷德的条纹。
Those don't look like Fred's stripes.

991
00:58:38,226 --> 00:58:40,228
不。我mustelid过敏。
No. My mustelid allergy.

992
00:58:40,311 --> 00:58:42,731
内森,持有它。这不是弗雷德。这不是弗雷德!
Nathan, hold it. It's not Fred. It's not Fred!

993
00:58:56,828 --> 00:58:59,706
我这么做是出于爱。
I'm doing this out of love.

994
00:59:03,877 --> 00:59:07,088
别担心。我有一个给你!
Don't worry. I got one for you!

995
00:59:08,923 --> 00:59:10,300
Sker-ploosh !
Sker-ploosh!

996
00:59:28,234 --> 00:59:29,361
不!别碰我。
No! Don't touch me.

997
00:59:39,746 --> 00:59:40,747
明确的。
Clear.

998
00:59:43,958 --> 00:59:44,958
嘘。
Shh.

999
00:59:50,173 --> 00:59:52,050
早上好,露营者。
Good morning, campers.

1000
00:59:52,133 --> 00:59:53,885
还有两天就要戴大礼帽了
Two days until Top Hat,

1001
00:59:53,968 --> 00:59:56,971
我很兴奋，我今天可以吃午饭了，
and I am so excited I may actually eat our lunch today,

1002
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:59,224
那将是肉糕，也将是晚餐。
which will be meat loaf, as will be dinner.

1003
00:59:59,307 --> 01:00:02,268
事实上，这个夏天剩下的时间，我们只需要和肉卷一起吃。
In fact, we're just gonna roll with meat loaf for the rest of the summer.

1004
01:00:05,188 --> 01:00:07,190
安迪,救命!
Andy, help!

1005
01:00:08,983 --> 01:00:10,568
他们也抓住了我。
They got me too.

1006
01:00:13,071 --> 01:00:15,073
的帮助!
Help!

1007
01:00:17,492 --> 01:00:20,620
嘿，怎么回事?把这些带回来。
Hey, what's going on? Bring those back.

1008
01:00:20,704 --> 01:00:21,705
穿过。
Coming through.

1009
01:00:21,788 --> 01:00:24,028
他们为最后的演出检查了一切。
They've checked everything out for the final performance.

1010
01:00:24,416 --> 01:00:28,169
你对老鹰伊森做了什么?伊桑·霍克是我的全部。
What are you doing with Ethan the hawk? Ethan Hawk is my whole act.

1011
01:00:28,962 --> 01:00:30,880
你不睡，你就输了，小家伙。
You snooze, you lose, little one.

1012
01:00:32,132 --> 01:00:34,718
一切都在哪儿?他们弄乱了我的东西。
Where's everything? They're messing with my things.

1013
01:00:35,802 --> 01:00:37,262
那么,什么是…我的表。
So, what is... My table.

1014
01:00:37,345 --> 01:00:39,639
没有什么。没有球，没有牌。
There's nothing. There's no balls, no cards.

1015
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:43,309
-钻石队检查了所有的道具。——什么?
- The Diamonds checked out all the props. - What?

1016
01:00:44,269 --> 01:00:45,645
-真不敢相信。——什么?
- I don't believe this. - What?

1017
01:00:47,647 --> 01:00:50,442
-他们使我们的心变小了。-怎么会这样?
- They shrunk our hearts. - How'd that happen?

1018
01:00:50,525 --> 01:00:52,861
他们把烘干机的设置调到了“重型”。
They switched the dryer setting to "heavy duty."

1019
01:00:52,944 --> 01:00:54,904
混合运动服装不是“重型”。
Polyblend athletic wear is not "heavy duty."

1020
01:00:54,988 --> 01:00:57,049
你觉得你是不是放错位置了?
Do you think maybe you just put it on the wrong setting?

1021
01:00:57,073 --> 01:00:59,176
你是…你是在指责我洗衣服的错误吗?
Are you... Are you accusing me of making a laundry mistake?

1022
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:03,455
我洗衣服从不出错，先生。我创造了洗衣奇迹。
I do not make laundry mistakes, sir. I make laundry miracles.

1023
01:01:03,538 --> 01:01:05,081
钻石毁了我们的行为。
The Diamonds have ruined our act.

1024
01:01:05,165 --> 01:01:06,875
我们还有计数轮。
We still have the counting wheel.

1025
01:01:09,794 --> 01:01:11,129
他们毁了一切!
They ruined everything!

1026
01:01:11,212 --> 01:01:14,174
关于黑木镇的事你是对的。她是冷血动物。
You were right about Darkwood. She is cold-blooded.

1027
01:01:14,257 --> 01:01:17,052
我们不可能为最后的演出及时准备好新材料。
We'll never get new stuff together in time for the final performance.

1028
01:01:17,135 --> 01:01:20,555
面对现实吧，伙计们，都结束了。他们击败了我们。
Face it, guys, it's over. They beat us.

1029
01:01:20,638 --> 01:01:22,533
反正我们也没有真正的机会。
It's not like we ever really had a chance anyway.

1030
01:01:22,557 --> 01:01:26,728
那不是真的。还记得你们刚来的时候有多可怕吗?
That's not true. Remember how horrible you guys were when you first got here?

1031
01:01:26,811 --> 01:01:28,688
你们现在少多了。
You guys suck way less now.

1032
01:01:28,772 --> 01:01:31,399
-多谢了-你是在恭维我吗?
- Thanks a lot. - Was that supposed to be a compliment?

1033
01:01:31,483 --> 01:01:33,151
说真的，我们不能放弃。
Seriously, we can't quit.

1034
01:01:33,234 --> 01:01:36,112
因为当事情变得困难时，心脏就会跳动起来。
'Cause when the going gets hard, the Hearts get going.

1035
01:01:36,196 --> 01:01:38,365
那很好。你刚想出来的?
That was pretty good. You just came up with that?

1036
01:01:38,448 --> 01:01:40,950
-很好，不是吗?-是的。这是可怕的。
- That was good, wasn't it? - Yeah. That was awesome.

1037
01:01:41,034 --> 01:01:44,204
你知道吗?我想我知道我们需要什么了。
You know what? I think I know what we need.

1038
01:01:44,287 --> 01:01:45,705
跟我来。
Follow me.

1039
01:01:53,129 --> 01:01:54,839
好的,帮派。
Okay, gang.

1040
01:01:54,923 --> 01:01:58,426
我们到了。
And here we are.

1041
01:01:59,135 --> 01:02:00,428
好吧。
Okay.

1042
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,018
哇!
Whoa!

1043
01:02:07,102 --> 01:02:09,437
你是怎么做到的?磁铁或电线吗?
How'd you do that? Magnets or wires?

1044
01:02:09,521 --> 01:02:11,981
既不。现代科技。
Neither. Just modern technology.

1045
01:02:12,065 --> 01:02:13,692
那么，我们在这里做什么?
So, what are we doing here?

1046
01:02:13,775 --> 01:02:15,902
一天晚上，我在堪萨斯城演出，
One night, I was playing a show in Kansas City,

1047
01:02:15,985 --> 01:02:18,154
航空公司把我的机箱放错飞机了。
and the airline put my prop case on the wrong plane.

1048
01:02:18,238 --> 01:02:19,364
哦,不太好。
Ooh, not good.

1049
01:02:19,447 --> 01:02:23,702
我只好在机场的便利店里随便找些东西凑合着用。
I had to improvise with whatever I could find at the airport convenience store.

1050
01:02:23,785 --> 01:02:26,538
而这正是我现在要求你们做的。
And that is exactly what I'm challenging you guys to do right now.

1051
01:02:26,621 --> 01:02:28,248
谁说我们需要道具?
Who says we need props?

1052
01:02:28,331 --> 01:02:30,750
戏法是魔术师创造的，而不是魔术师创造的。
Magicians create the trick, not the other way around.

1053
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:33,294
你可以把它想象成一个神奇的寻宝活动。
Think of it as like a magical treasure hunt.

1054
01:02:33,378 --> 01:02:35,922
通常在寻宝游戏中，参与者会被提供
Um, typically in a treasure hunt, the participants are provided

1055
01:02:36,006 --> 01:02:37,424
有线索，有地图，有传说…
with clues, a map, or a legend...

1056
01:02:37,507 --> 01:02:39,944
——走吧。30分钟后见。-我们会得到线索还是地图?
- Let's go. See you in 30 minutes. - Are we gonna get clues or a map?

1057
01:02:39,968 --> 01:02:43,054
玩得开心。想想看，好吗?即兴发挥。
Have fun. Figure it out, all right? Improvise.

1058
01:03:01,114 --> 01:03:02,615
也许这一个。
Maybe this one.

1059
01:03:04,325 --> 01:03:06,661
这是垃圾。这不是形状。
This is garbage. This is just not the shape.

1060
01:03:07,996 --> 01:03:09,998
那
That.

1061
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:19,174
内森,内森。
Nathan, Nathan.

1062
01:03:21,926 --> 01:03:24,596
对不起,每一个人。我能引起你的注意吗?
Excuse me, everybody. Can I get your attention?

1063
01:03:24,679 --> 01:03:26,890
今天，我们将向你展示一些魔术。
Today, we're gonna show you some magic.

1064
01:03:27,474 --> 01:03:29,017
把它拿走，维拉。
Take it away, Vera.

1065
01:03:36,483 --> 01:03:37,484
太酷了。
So cool.

1066
01:03:42,530 --> 01:03:43,531
——明白了吗?-是的。
- Got it? - Yeah.

1067
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:44,616
酷。
Cool.

1068
01:03:46,826 --> 01:03:48,995
对不起，这个刻度有多精确?
Excuse me, how accurate is that scale?

1069
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:51,790
测量重量到千分之一磅。
Measures weight down to a thousandth of a pound.

1070
01:03:52,165 --> 01:03:55,418
如果他能猜出确切的重量，我们能免费得到这个糖果吗?
If he can guess the exact weight, can we have this candy for free?

1071
01:03:55,794 --> 01:03:57,796
确定。这是不可能的。
Sure. That's impossible.

1072
01:03:57,879 --> 01:04:02,092
这是不可能的，还是2.173磅?
Is it impossible, or is it 2.173 pounds?

1073
01:04:03,134 --> 01:04:05,720
2.173磅。
2.173 pounds.

1074
01:04:05,804 --> 01:04:07,555
——是的!——这是不可思议的。
- Yeah! - That's incredible.

1075
01:04:07,639 --> 01:04:12,185
酷,伙计。我们省了11.54美元(含税)。
Cool, dude. We just saved $11.54, tax included.

1076
01:04:12,268 --> 01:04:13,645
哇!
Whoo!

1077
01:04:13,728 --> 01:04:15,480
我正试着学习如何正确持球。
I'm trying to learn to hold the ball right.

1078
01:04:15,563 --> 01:04:17,774
这些神奇的孩子们怎么了?
What's up with all these weird magic kids?

1079
01:04:17,857 --> 01:04:19,526
群lame-os。
Bunch of lame-os.

1080
01:04:19,609 --> 01:04:23,113
嘿!你说的那些是我的朋友。
Hey! Those are my friends you're talking about.

1081
01:04:23,196 --> 01:04:26,032
怪异让我们很棒。
And weird is what makes us awesome.

1082
01:04:26,116 --> 01:04:28,743
攻击!抓住他们的眼睛。
Attack! Go for their eyes.

1083
01:04:28,827 --> 01:04:31,621
走,走!
Go, go!

1084
01:04:35,667 --> 01:04:37,335
我还会碰一只兔子吗?
Am I ever going to touch a bunny?

1085
01:04:37,419 --> 01:04:39,879
总有一天，我保证你会的。
One day, I promise you will.

1086
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:43,758
不是只有一打逃跑了吗?现在他们无处不在。
Didn't only a dozen escape? Now they're everywhere.

1087
01:04:43,842 --> 01:04:45,552
它们是如何繁殖的?
How are they multiplying?

1088
01:04:47,262 --> 01:04:50,098
我会让你父母解释的。
You know, I'm gonna let your parents explain that one.

1089
01:04:52,892 --> 01:04:57,022
好吧，已经超过你的宵禁时间了。进去睡觉吧。
Okay, way past your curfew. Get in there and get to bed.

1090
01:04:57,105 --> 01:04:59,232
你要去哪里?
Where are you going?

1091
01:04:59,315 --> 01:05:01,252
-我有账要算。-我保证他会来的
- I've got a score to settle. - I promise you he'll show.

1092
01:05:01,276 --> 01:05:03,069
用黑木制作嘿,!
Hey, Darkwood!

1093
01:05:03,153 --> 01:05:05,131
他现在就在那里。好吧。我待会再打给你。
There he is right now. All right. I'll talk to you later.

1094
01:05:05,155 --> 01:05:06,823
把电话挂了，你这个怪物。
Get off the phone, you monster.

1095
01:05:07,699 --> 01:05:09,701
你刚才叫我怪物吗?
Did you just call me a monster?

1096
01:05:09,784 --> 01:05:13,455
破坏我和我的事业是一回事，但是孩子呢?
It's one thing to sabotage me and my career, but children?

1097
01:05:13,538 --> 01:05:15,790
你真的能接受这个退出的事情吗?
Were you really cool with this whole sign-out thing?

1098
01:05:15,874 --> 01:05:20,337
严重吗?我已经罚了我的铺位，还让他们把所有的道具都退了。
Seriously? I already punished my bunk and made them return all the props.

1099
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:21,504
但是你怎么了?
But what's up with you?

1100
01:05:21,588 --> 01:05:24,382
当我第一次听说你今年夏天要来的时候
You know, when I first heard you were coming this summer,

1101
01:05:24,466 --> 01:05:26,176
见到你我很兴奋。
I was excited to see you.

1102
01:05:26,259 --> 01:05:28,511
我以为我们之间的争执已经过去了
I thought we'd be past whatever beef we had

1103
01:05:28,595 --> 01:05:32,223
我们可以…朋友了。
and we could just be... friends again.

1104
01:05:32,307 --> 01:05:35,226
你说得倒容易。
That is so easy for you to say.

1105
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:38,813
当你抛弃我时，我一无所有，而你拥有一切。
I got nothing and you got everything when you dropped me.

1106
01:05:38,897 --> 01:05:39,939
我放弃了你?
I dropped you?

1107
01:05:40,023 --> 01:05:42,817
-你背叛了我-我从没背叛过你。
- You cheated on me. - I never cheated on you.

1108
01:05:42,901 --> 01:05:44,444
你欺骗了我们。
You cheated on our act.

1109
01:05:45,153 --> 01:05:49,949
”凯。好吧，我承认。我背着你参加了那个电视会议。
'Kay. Yes, fine, I'll admit it. I took that TV meeting behind your back.

1110
01:05:50,033 --> 01:05:52,744
你总是叫我你的门徒。
You were always calling me your protégée.

1111
01:05:52,827 --> 01:05:54,621
我想看看我自己能不能做到。
I wanted to see if I could do it on my own.

1112
01:05:54,704 --> 01:05:57,540
你的背叛终于被揭露了。
Your treachery is finally revealed.

1113
01:05:57,624 --> 01:06:01,169
是的。他们认为我在电视上独自表演会更好。
Yes. They thought I would be a better solo act on TV.

1114
01:06:01,252 --> 01:06:03,296
他们讨厌Abraca-Duo这个名字。
And they hated the name Abraca-Duo.

1115
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:04,547
当时它很吸引人!
It was catchy at the time!

1116
01:06:04,631 --> 01:06:06,341
-但我拒绝了——到底!
- But I told them no. - Exactly!

1117
01:06:06,424 --> 01:06:07,842
什么?
What?

1118
01:06:08,426 --> 01:06:10,970
我告诉他们我不是一个独角戏演员。
I told them I wasn't a solo act.

1119
01:06:11,054 --> 01:06:13,431
我想为我们俩谈点条件
I was trying to negotiate a deal for the both of us,

1120
01:06:13,515 --> 01:06:15,767
但我还没来得及解释你就辞职了。
but you quit before I could explain.

1121
01:06:18,186 --> 01:06:20,814
——为什么……你为什么不阻止我?-因为你发疯了。
- Why... Why didn't you stop me? - 'Cause you were flipping out.

1122
01:06:20,897 --> 01:06:23,066
你不回我的电话和短信。
You wouldn't return any of my phone calls or texts.

1123
01:06:23,149 --> 01:06:26,027
你忙着在任何一个愿意听的魔术师面前说我的坏话。
You were too busy bad-mouthing me to any magician that would listen.

1124
01:06:26,111 --> 01:06:27,904
所以我一个人做了这件事。
So I did the act alone.

1125
01:06:27,987 --> 01:06:30,740
没有你，我很害怕。
I was terrified to do it without you.

1126
01:06:32,117 --> 01:06:34,202
-太疯狂了。——为什么?
- That is crazy. - Why?

1127
01:06:34,911 --> 01:06:37,205
你知道那个电视布克一开始为什么选你吗?
You know why that TV booker picked you in the first place?

1128
01:06:37,288 --> 01:06:39,374
因为，我是说，看看你。
Because, I mean, look at you.

1129
01:06:39,833 --> 01:06:42,043
你注定要成为一个明星。
You were destined to be a star.

1130
01:06:42,127 --> 01:06:45,130
我知道，他知道，每个人都知道。
I knew it, he knew it, everyone knew it.

1131
01:06:45,213 --> 01:06:49,884
和…显然，我注定要开一辆出租马车。
And... evidently I was destined to drive a cab.

1132
01:06:50,510 --> 01:06:52,012
男人。连优步都没有?
Man. Not even an Uber?

1133
01:06:52,095 --> 01:06:54,180
我在这里倾吐我的心声。
I am pouring my heart out here.

1134
01:06:54,264 --> 01:06:55,807
我很抱歉。我很抱歉。
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1135
01:06:55,890 --> 01:06:59,769
安迪，你是我见过的最好的魔术师之一。
Andy, you are one of the best magicians I have ever seen.

1136
01:06:59,853 --> 01:07:01,021
是的，这是真的。
Yes, that is true.

1137
01:07:01,104 --> 01:07:04,107
我所知道的几乎都是从你和普雷斯顿那里学来的。
I learned almost everything I know from you and Preston.

1138
01:07:05,191 --> 01:07:07,318
看着你这个夏天在床上工作
And watching you work with your bunk this summer

1139
01:07:07,402 --> 01:07:09,446
提醒我你有多棒。
reminded me how awesome you are.

1140
01:07:09,821 --> 01:07:10,905
不客气
You're welcome.

1141
01:07:10,989 --> 01:07:14,242
别傻了，否则我不会告诉你电话上是谁。
Stop being a jerk, or I am not going to tell you who I was on the phone with.

1142
01:07:14,325 --> 01:07:15,765
为什么?你在和谁通电话?
Why? Who were you on the phone with?

1143
01:07:15,827 --> 01:07:18,788
我朋友经营着金银岛
Well, my friend runs Treasure Island,

1144
01:07:18,872 --> 01:07:22,500
明天的日场演出在最后一刻被取消了
and he just had a last-minute cancellation for a matinee performance tomorrow

1145
01:07:22,584 --> 01:07:25,587
他问我是否知道有谁准备好进入这个阶段了。
and asked me if I knew anybody who was ready to work that stage.

1146
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:27,964
是我推荐你的。
And I recommended you.

1147
01:07:30,342 --> 01:07:34,054
我不知道该怎么办…日场吗?真的吗?连夜场都没有?
I don't know what to... A matinee? Really? Not even an evening show?

1148
01:07:34,137 --> 01:07:36,264
严重吗?你到底要不要那个演出?
Seriously? Do you want the gig or not?

1149
01:07:37,349 --> 01:07:38,600
-嗨。——不要说话。
- Hey. - Don't speak.

1150
01:07:39,684 --> 01:07:41,186
什么也别说。
Don't say a word.

1151
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:42,896
等一等。
Hold on.

1152
01:07:42,979 --> 01:07:45,607
他们邀请你去金银岛看演出。
They've offered you a show at Treasure Island.

1153
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:48,193
-黑木已经发短信给你了?-大约一小时前。
- Darkwood texted you already? - About an hour ago.

1154
01:07:48,276 --> 01:07:52,155
祝贺你。这是……这是巨大的。
Congratulations. That is... It's huge.

1155
01:07:52,739 --> 01:07:53,948
我知道,对吧?
I know, right?

1156
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,035
你看起来不太高兴。
You don't seem very happy.

1157
01:07:57,535 --> 01:08:01,081
如果我参加演出，我会及时回来看演出的，
Well, if I take the gig, I'll be back in time for the show,

1158
01:08:01,164 --> 01:08:04,959
但我明天不会在这里帮他们一起行动，
but I won't be here tomorrow to help the bunk put their acts together,

1159
01:08:05,043 --> 01:08:07,921
和…相信我，那些混蛋，他们需要我。
and... I mean, trust me, those screw-ups, they need me.

1160
01:08:08,004 --> 01:08:09,089
你需要什么?
What do you need?

1161
01:08:09,172 --> 01:08:12,509
你这辈子都在梦想这一刻，不是吗?
You've been dreaming about this moment your whole life, haven't you?

1162
01:08:14,552 --> 01:08:15,553
我想是的。
I think so.

1163
01:08:15,637 --> 01:08:18,932
我不能告诉你该做什么，但我内心深处知道，
I can't tell you what to do, but I know that deep down,

1164
01:08:19,683 --> 01:08:21,184
你已经有了答案。
you already have the answer.

1165
01:08:21,267 --> 01:08:23,412
那床铺呢?我不能不说再见就走。
What about the bunk? I can't leave without saying goodbye.

1166
01:08:23,436 --> 01:08:27,232
让他们睡觉，好吗?走了。我明天早上再跟他们解释。
Let 'em sleep, all right? Go. I'll explain to them in the morning.

1167
01:08:27,315 --> 01:08:29,150
——走吧。——好的。
- Go. - Okay.

1168
01:08:49,462 --> 01:08:51,089
早上好,露营者。
Good morning, campers.

1169
01:08:51,172 --> 01:08:53,508
今天是我们一直在等待的一天。
Today is the day we've all been waiting for.

1170
01:08:53,591 --> 01:08:56,344
今天你们的父母将看到你们这个暑假所做的一切。
Today your parents will see all that you've worked on this summer.

1171
01:08:56,428 --> 01:09:00,598
午餐是热辣龙虾配牛肝菌和法式鲜奶油烩饭。
Lunch will be lobster thermidor with a porcini and crème fraîche risotto.

1172
01:09:01,099 --> 01:09:03,852
请随意向你的父母提及今天的晚餐。
Feel free to mention today's meal to your parents.

1173
01:09:04,894 --> 01:09:07,355
看起来他昨晚根本就没睡过这里。
It doesn't look like he even slept here last night.

1174
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:10,650
-是啊，他的垃圾袋也没了。-他好像消失了。
- Yeah, and his trash bags are gone. - It's like he vanished.

1175
01:09:10,734 --> 01:09:12,235
我出现了。
And I have appeared.

1176
01:09:12,318 --> 01:09:14,988
好了，临时会议，五分钟。来吧。
All right, bunk meeting, five minutes. Come on.

1177
01:09:16,031 --> 01:09:17,365
穿好衣服。我们走吧。
Get dressed. Let's go.

1178
01:09:17,449 --> 01:09:19,159
——什么?严重吗?——请问?
- What? Seriously? - Excuse me?

1179
01:09:19,242 --> 01:09:21,745
-他去维加斯了?是的，他去了维加斯。
- He went to Vegas? - Yes, he went to Vegas.

1180
01:09:21,828 --> 01:09:25,665
他得到了表演的机会。这就是魔术师所做的。
He's been given the chance to perform. That's what magicians do.

1181
01:09:25,749 --> 01:09:28,043
这就是你今晚要做的。
That's what you're gonna be doing tonight.

1182
01:09:28,126 --> 01:09:31,254
他会及时回来看你比赛的。
And he will be back in time to watch you compete.

1183
01:09:31,338 --> 01:09:34,382
我们该如何竞争?我是说，没有他我们做不到。
How are we supposed to compete? I mean, we can't do it without him.

1184
01:09:34,466 --> 01:09:36,343
他会帮我们一起行动。
He was gonna help us put our acts together.

1185
01:09:36,426 --> 01:09:38,345
——正确的。-但现在我来了。
- Right. - But now I'm here.

1186
01:09:38,428 --> 01:09:41,097
我将帮助你们一起行动。好吧?
And I will help you put your act together. All right?

1187
01:09:41,181 --> 01:09:43,350
所以，让我们卷起袖子
So, let's just roll up our sleeves

1188
01:09:43,433 --> 01:09:45,101
然后开始工作。
and get to work.

1189
01:09:45,185 --> 01:09:47,979
不要碰萨米。他今天早上有点不舒服。
Don't touch Sammy. He was a little bitey this morning.

1190
01:09:49,230 --> 01:09:52,567
我们开始吧。这是她要选的卡片。
Here we go. This is the card that she will choose.

1191
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:55,070
她会选这张牌。这是一个保证。
She's gonna pick this card. It's a guarantee.

1192
01:09:55,153 --> 01:09:57,447
你看到了吗?”凯。
You see that? 'Kay.

1193
01:09:57,530 --> 01:10:00,658
现在，我要把它藏起来妥善保管。
Now, I'm gonna tuck it away for safekeeping.

1194
01:10:00,742 --> 01:10:01,993
把它放在那儿。
Put it right there.

1195
01:10:02,077 --> 01:10:08,249
现在我要用一副完全不同的牌。
Now I'm gonna take a completely different deck of cards, right here.

1196
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:10,877
她可以选择这些牌中的任何一张。
And she can choose any one of these cards.

1197
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:11,961
绝对的。
Absolutely.

1198
01:10:12,045 --> 01:10:15,465
点击其中一个的背面，好吗?
Go ahead and just touch the back of one, okay?

1199
01:10:15,548 --> 01:10:17,634
我们笑是因为她有这么多选择吗?
Are we laughing because she has so many choices?

1200
01:10:17,717 --> 01:10:19,761
这就是我们笑的原因吗?
Is that what we're laughing about?

1201
01:10:19,844 --> 01:10:22,555
——这一个。——卡。你确定吗?
- This one. - That card. Are you sure?

1202
01:10:22,639 --> 01:10:24,766
这就是那张牌。“凯?
So, this is the card. 'Kay?

1203
01:10:24,849 --> 01:10:28,103
我偷偷怀疑我们不会忘记这件事的，好吗?
And I have a sneaking suspicion we're not gonna forget this one, okay?

1204
01:10:28,186 --> 01:10:31,314
这是你的名片。现在，继续，把它放在你的胸部。
Here's your card. Now, go ahead and place it towards your chest.

1205
01:10:31,398 --> 01:10:33,692
就在那里，就在你的心上。不要看。
Right there, right on your heart. Don't look.

1206
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:36,236
好吧，现在来点俏皮话。
All right, now take a little peeksy.

1207
01:10:36,945 --> 01:10:39,906
告诉观众，这是红牌还是黑牌?
Tell the audience, is it a red card or a black card?

1208
01:10:39,989 --> 01:10:41,282
它是红色的。
It's red.

1209
01:10:42,325 --> 01:10:45,078
对，不是卡片背面。
Yeah, not the back of the card.

1210
01:10:45,161 --> 01:10:48,581
我们说的是牌面。实际的卡片。
We're talking about the face of the card. The actual card.

1211
01:10:48,665 --> 01:10:51,251
是什么颜色的?
What color's that?

1212
01:10:51,334 --> 01:10:53,670
它是红色的。
It's red.

1213
01:10:53,753 --> 01:10:55,213
我能看一下吗?
Can I see that?

1214
01:10:58,049 --> 01:10:59,551
噢!
Ooh!

1215
01:10:59,634 --> 01:11:02,637
是的，那是红方块5。
Yes, that is a red five of diamonds.

1216
01:11:02,721 --> 01:11:05,557
和…这真的很尴尬
And... this is really awkward

1217
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:08,810
给那些认为我搞砸了的人。
for anyone in here who thought I messed up.

1218
01:11:15,025 --> 01:11:18,028
大家为海莉鼓掌吧哈利!
Give it up for Haley, everybody. Haley!

1219
01:11:18,945 --> 01:11:20,363
谢谢你！
Thank you.

1220
01:11:25,702 --> 01:11:29,080
黑木说得对。她说你会是一个很好的日场魔术师。
Darkwood was right about you. She said you'd be a good matinee magician.

1221
01:11:29,748 --> 01:11:32,208
她说的?这实际上有点侮辱人。
She said that? That is actually a little insulting.

1222
01:11:32,292 --> 01:11:34,169
但你在黄金时间会更好。
But that you'd be even better in prime time.

1223
01:11:34,252 --> 01:11:36,254
今晚来个表演怎么样?
How'd you like a showcase tonight?

1224
01:11:37,922 --> 01:11:39,758
今晚吗?Tonight-tonight吗?
Tonight? Tonight-tonight?

1225
01:11:40,717 --> 01:11:44,387
事实上，今晚有点复杂。
Actually, tonight is a little complicated.

1226
01:11:44,471 --> 01:11:46,348
让我简单地告诉你。
Let me make this simple for you.

1227
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:49,809
这里有上百万的魔术师，他们都想看8点的表演，
There's a million magicians who would kill for an eight o'clock show on the strip,

1228
01:11:49,893 --> 01:11:51,186
我给你一个机会。
and I'm offering you one.

1229
01:11:51,269 --> 01:11:55,398
你今晚表现得很好，这个剧院可能会成为你很长一段时间的家。
You do well tonight, this theater could be your home for a very long time.

1230
01:11:55,482 --> 01:11:56,816
你说呢?
What do you say?

1231
01:11:58,610 --> 01:11:59,611
让我们做它。是的。
Let's do it. Yes.

1232
01:11:59,694 --> 01:12:02,238
太好了。把东西打开，就像在自己家一样。
Excellent. Unpack your things, make yourself at home.

1233
01:12:02,322 --> 01:12:03,323
太好了。
Great.

1234
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:32,227
我有一只蚕，她不仅会丝，还会木!
I have a silkworm that not only makes silk, she also makes wood!

1235
01:12:32,310 --> 01:12:33,895
哇!
Whoa!

1236
01:12:33,978 --> 01:12:36,439
他的名字叫科尔内留斯·凯斯勒。这是我的名片。
The name is Kornelius Kessler. Here's my card.

1237
01:12:36,523 --> 01:12:38,858
如果你喜欢你看到的，请在Yelp上评论我。
If you liked what you saw, review me on Yelp.

1238
01:12:38,942 --> 01:12:40,318
我儿子今天表演。
My son is performing today.

1239
01:12:40,402 --> 01:12:43,405
当你看到丝绒领结时，你就知道你得到了一个高质量的表演。
When you see the velvet bow tie, you know you're getting a quality act.

1240
01:12:44,906 --> 01:12:47,367
-领结怎么样?-我就在这里。
- What about the bow tie? - I've got it right here.

1241
01:12:50,954 --> 01:12:52,372
很高兴见到你。
It's so nice to meet you.

1242
01:12:57,293 --> 01:13:00,463
原谅我。嗨。这张有人拍了吗?谢谢。
Excuse me. Hi. Is this one taken? Thanks.

1243
01:13:00,547 --> 01:13:03,216
好了，红心们，振作起来。嘿，伙计们，过来。
Okay, Hearts, gather up. Hey, guys, come here.

1244
01:13:03,299 --> 01:13:07,095
好吧，我们得好好谈谈。
All right, um, we have to have a little heart-to-Hearts.

1245
01:13:07,178 --> 01:13:09,264
-怎么回事?-安迪打电话来了
- What's going on? - Well, Andy called

1246
01:13:09,347 --> 01:13:10,724
不幸的是,
and, unfortunately,

1247
01:13:10,807 --> 01:13:15,562
他毕竟不能及时赶回来戴大礼帽了。
he is not going to be able to make it back in time for the Top Hat after all.

1248
01:13:15,645 --> 01:13:18,023
但他想让我告诉你他有多骄傲
But he wanted me to tell you how very, very proud he is

1249
01:13:18,106 --> 01:13:19,983
你们每一个人。
of each and every one of you.

1250
01:13:20,066 --> 01:13:22,110
当然，我也是。
And, of course, so am I.

1251
01:13:22,193 --> 01:13:23,653
我们该怎么办?
What are we supposed to do?

1252
01:13:27,157 --> 01:13:30,410
当事情变得困难时，心脏就会跳动起来。
When the going gets hard, the Hearts get going.

1253
01:13:30,493 --> 01:13:31,911
我们来做这件事。
Let's do this thing.

1254
01:13:31,995 --> 01:13:34,748
我们来做这件事。这就是精神。
Let's do this thing. That's the spirit.

1255
01:13:34,831 --> 01:13:37,292
西奥,安迪特别……
Theo, Andy specifically...

1256
01:13:38,293 --> 01:13:40,628
嗯,哪里来的……他去了?
Well, where'd... he go?

1257
01:13:40,712 --> 01:13:42,881
普雷斯顿。
Preston, you're on.

1258
01:13:42,964 --> 01:13:45,175
好吧。的地方,好吗?祝你好运。
Okay. Places, all right? Good luck.

1259
01:13:45,508 --> 01:13:48,511
从一开始，我们就对这种壮举感到惊叹
Since the dawn of time, we have marveled at the feats

1260
01:13:48,595 --> 01:13:51,890
由少数敢于窥见天外的人来完成。
performed by the select few who dare peer into the beyond.

1261
01:13:52,974 --> 01:13:53,975
魔术师。
Magicians.

1262
01:13:57,604 --> 01:13:59,356
欢迎,欢迎。
Welcome, welcome.

1263
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:01,608
现在，这个夏天，你们的每一个孩子
Now, this summer, every single one of your children

1264
01:14:01,691 --> 01:14:04,361
已经在这个神秘的秩序中赢得了一席之地。
have earned their place in this mystical order.

1265
01:14:04,444 --> 01:14:06,279
但他们当中谁学得最多?
But who among them has learned the most?

1266
01:14:06,363 --> 01:14:12,202
那么，谁注定会拿着礼帽和金魔杖呢?
And which ones are destined to hold the Top Hat and the Golden Wand?

1267
01:14:13,912 --> 01:14:17,916
好吧。做好被震惊和震惊的准备，
All right. Be prepared to be shocked and astounded,

1268
01:14:17,999 --> 01:14:21,378
因为今年的比赛从现在开始。
because this year's competition begins now.

1269
01:14:21,461 --> 01:14:26,383
首先，代表红心小屋的露丝·布鲁塞尔巴赫。
First up, representing the Hearts cabin, Ruth Brusselbach.

1270
01:15:08,174 --> 01:15:09,968
-摸摸小兔!-你能行的，露丝!
- Touch the bunny! - You can do it, Ruth!

1271
01:15:10,051 --> 01:15:13,805
你能做到的。来吧。兔子的爱是真实的!你是一个武士。
You can do it. Come on. Bunny love is real! You're a samurai.

1272
01:15:23,982 --> 01:15:29,112
接下来是代表钻石小屋的维克·德·安东尼奥。
Next up, representing the Diamond cabin, Vic d'Antonio.

1273
01:15:35,785 --> 01:15:39,873
我是受害者，我提前向你们所有的父母道歉
Hey, I'm the Vic, and I apologize to all you parents in advance

1274
01:15:39,956 --> 01:15:42,959
因为我又要赢得金魔杖了。
'cause I'm about to win the Golden Wand, again.

1275
01:15:43,918 --> 01:15:47,672
现在选一张牌，任意一张。只是碰它。
Now pick a card, any card. Just touch it.

1276
01:15:48,131 --> 01:15:49,132
好吧。
Okay.

1277
01:15:50,467 --> 01:15:52,635
记住它。不要忘记它。
Memorize it. Don't forget it.

1278
01:15:54,095 --> 01:15:56,097
我会把甲板交给我的助手。
I'll hand the deck to my assistant.

1279
01:15:59,642 --> 01:16:05,732
她的工作很简单。现在看这个。
Her job's easy. Now watch this.

1280
01:16:14,324 --> 01:16:15,700
这是你的名片吗?
Was this your card?

1281
01:16:26,336 --> 01:16:27,879
你怎么知道我在这里?
How'd you know I was in here?

1282
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:30,382
你知道现在有个魔术表演吗?
You know there's a magic show going on right now?

1283
01:16:30,465 --> 01:16:32,592
如果安迪不在，我就不表演。
I'm not performing if Andy's not here.

1284
01:16:32,676 --> 01:16:35,053
你的家人在外面。和你的妈妈。
Your family's out there. And your mom.

1285
01:16:35,136 --> 01:16:38,306
你不想让你妈妈看到你这个暑假学到的所有魔法吗?
Don't you want your mom to see all the magic you've learned this summer?

1286
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:42,060
她不在乎魔法。她甚至不知道这个地方。
She doesn't care about magic. She didn't even know about this place.

1287
01:16:42,143 --> 01:16:45,105
她以为那是魔法营。你能相信吗?
She thought it was called Magic Camp. Can you believe that?

1288
01:16:45,188 --> 01:16:46,188
嗯,有点。
Um, sort of.

1289
01:16:46,231 --> 01:16:48,817
魔术是我和爸爸的最爱。
Magic was my thing with my dad.

1290
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:51,111
我来是因为他替我申请的。
I'm here because he applied for me.

1291
01:16:51,778 --> 01:16:56,116
和…现在他走了。那么，重点是什么呢?
And... now he's gone. So, what's the point?

1292
01:16:56,199 --> 01:16:57,826
你这么说很有意思。
Interesting you should say that.

1293
01:16:57,909 --> 01:17:00,662
红心杯的下一位，薇拉·科斯塔。
Next up from the Hearts, Vera Costa.

1294
01:17:29,482 --> 01:17:32,027
我把所有的申请都存档了。
I keep all my applications on file.

1295
01:17:32,110 --> 01:17:35,030
和…我当然记得你的。
And... I remember yours, of course.

1296
01:17:40,368 --> 01:17:41,369
等一等。
Hold on.

1297
01:17:41,953 --> 01:17:44,664
因为那是我。我是红心j。
'Cause that's me. I'm the jack of hearts.

1298
01:17:44,748 --> 01:17:48,960
这就是你。你是红心之王。
And that's you. You're the king of hearts.

1299
01:17:49,044 --> 01:17:50,128
等等，谁开的枪?
Wait, who shot this?

1300
01:17:50,211 --> 01:17:52,047
这是难以置信的。你是不可思议的,西奥。
That's incredible. You're incredible, Theo.

1301
01:17:53,798 --> 01:17:56,301
哇。你看到这个把戏了吗?
Wow. Did you just see that trick?

1302
01:17:56,384 --> 01:17:59,095
我儿子是个了不起的魔术师。
My son is an amazing magician.

1303
01:17:59,179 --> 01:18:00,805
我不知道他是怎么做到的。
I don't know how he does any of it.

1304
01:18:01,890 --> 01:18:05,727
但你可能看不到的是，他已经克服了多少困难。
But what you might not see is how much he has overcome.

1305
01:18:06,686 --> 01:18:07,687
多少……
How much...

1306
01:18:10,982 --> 01:18:13,610
我希望西奥能看到我在他身上看到的一切。
I wish Theo could see everything that I see in him.

1307
01:18:14,694 --> 01:18:16,529
但他把一切都锁在心里
But he keeps it all locked inside,

1308
01:18:16,613 --> 01:18:19,991
魔法是开启他的第一步。
and magic is the first thing that's unlocked him.

1309
01:18:20,408 --> 01:18:22,118
我想这是一种技巧，对吧?
I guess that's sort of a trick, right?

1310
01:18:22,619 --> 01:18:26,498
这就是为什么你不带他去你的魔法训练营
That's why you'd be crazy not to take him for your magic camp,

1311
01:18:26,581 --> 01:18:29,000
或者研究所，或者别的什么。
or institute, or whatever.

1312
01:18:32,837 --> 01:18:35,882
我可能有点古怪
Well, I may be eccentric,

1313
01:18:35,965 --> 01:18:41,179
但是，我从来没有像现在这样被申请说服过。
but, I don't think I've ever been more persuaded by an application.

1314
01:18:42,681 --> 01:18:46,518
西奥，我不能告诉你该怎么做
Theo, I cannot tell you what to do,

1315
01:18:46,601 --> 01:18:50,397
但我知道在内心深处你已经有了答案。
but I know deep down you already have the answer.

1316
01:18:51,648 --> 01:18:53,692
但我不能一个人上去。
But I can't go up there alone.

1317
01:18:53,775 --> 01:18:55,568
安迪说你会这么说的。
Andy said you would say that.

1318
01:18:55,652 --> 01:19:00,448
但他让我告诉你，如果你在舞台上迷路了，
But he told me to tell you that if you lose your way on stage,

1319
01:19:00,532 --> 01:19:02,492
只要看看翅膀就行了
just look to the wings

1320
01:19:02,575 --> 01:19:06,079
你会找到一个真正的魔术师来帮助你。
and you'll find a true magician to help you.

1321
01:19:06,162 --> 01:19:07,664
这是什么意思?
What does that mean?

1322
01:19:08,164 --> 01:19:09,457
只有一个办法可以知道。
Only one way to find out.

1323
01:19:11,459 --> 01:19:13,378
好吧，我需要一点帮助。
Okay, I'll need a little help here.

1324
01:19:13,878 --> 01:19:16,506
年轻的绅士，你在学校的储物柜号码是多少?
Young gent, what is your locker combination at school?

1325
01:19:17,424 --> 01:19:20,468
别担心，我不会偷你的作业，也不会替你做。
Don't worry, I'm not gonna steal your homework, or do it for you.

1326
01:19:20,552 --> 01:19:23,805
16岁,98年,17岁。
Sixteen, 98, 17.

1327
01:19:23,888 --> 01:19:25,140
太好了,好了。
Great, okay.

1328
01:19:25,223 --> 01:19:28,309
女士，输入1-6-9-8-1-7。
Ma'am, type in 1-6-9-8-1-7.

1329
01:19:28,393 --> 01:19:30,061
然后点击时间。
And then hit times.

1330
01:19:30,145 --> 01:19:33,273
好吧，先生，你的生日是什么?你。
Okay, um, you, sir, what is your birthday? You.

1331
01:19:33,815 --> 01:19:34,816
10月9日。
October 9.

1332
01:19:34,899 --> 01:19:36,693
10月9日吗?- 9,很好。
October 9? 10-9, great.

1333
01:19:36,776 --> 01:19:40,071
女士，输入1-0-9。然后打次。
Ma'am, type in 1-0-9. Then hit times.

1334
01:19:40,155 --> 01:19:44,367
不要大声说出来，输入你初吻时的年龄。
Don't say this out loud, but type in the age you were when you had your first kiss.

1335
01:19:47,912 --> 01:19:51,958
现在，点击等于，一次念一个数给我听。
Now, hit equals and read the number aloud to me one digit at a time.

1336
01:19:52,417 --> 01:19:54,044
- 7。- 7。
- Seven. - Seven.

1337
01:19:54,127 --> 01:19:55,670
- 4。- 4。
- Four. - Four.

1338
01:19:55,754 --> 01:19:57,589
——零。——零。
- Zero. - Zero.

1339
01:19:57,672 --> 01:19:59,341
- 4。- 4。
- Four. - Four.

1340
01:19:59,424 --> 01:20:02,010
——零,两个。——两个。
- Zero, two. - Two.

1341
01:20:02,469 --> 01:20:03,553
一,二。
One, two.

1342
01:20:03,636 --> 01:20:04,804
一,二。
One, two.

1343
01:20:04,888 --> 01:20:06,681
对不起，我写得乱七八糟。
Sorry for my messy handwriting.

1344
01:20:06,765 --> 01:20:09,851
所以,74040212。
So, 74,040,212.

1345
01:20:09,934 --> 01:20:13,938
我不可能知道这些信息
Okay, so there's no possible way I could've known any of the information

1346
01:20:14,022 --> 01:20:15,462
你今晚要给我的
that you were gonna give me tonight.

1347
01:20:15,523 --> 01:20:18,735
然而，我们用你们的数字创造了这个巨大的数字。
Yet, we used your numbers to create this huge number.

1348
01:20:18,818 --> 01:20:23,490
现在，我想请大家注意这个神秘的信封。
Now, I would like to call your attention to this envelope of mystery.

1349
01:20:23,573 --> 01:20:26,534
今天早些时候，我把我的预测放进了这个信封里。
Earlier today, I put my prediction inside this envelope.

1350
01:20:26,618 --> 01:20:29,537
现在我来告诉你们。
And now I am going to reveal it to you.

1351
01:20:32,582 --> 01:20:35,418
大象。惊人的,对吧?
Elephant. Amazing, right?

1352
01:20:38,505 --> 01:20:40,965
我知道你很困惑。这是上下颠倒的。
I see you're confused. It's upside down.

1353
01:20:42,634 --> 01:20:45,220
- Ho !——“大象”。
- Ho! - "Elephant."

1354
01:20:46,137 --> 01:20:47,138
我的…
My...

1355
01:20:51,351 --> 01:20:53,103
我是一个mathemagician。
I'm a mathemagician.

1356
01:20:54,104 --> 01:20:58,858
最后是为钻石乐队表演的詹妮尔·桑托斯。
And finally, performing for the Diamonds, Janelle Santos.

1357
01:21:13,331 --> 01:21:14,332
詹妮尔。
Janelle.

1358
01:21:47,032 --> 01:21:48,033
准备好了吗?
Ready?

1359
01:21:48,783 --> 01:21:50,827
一个,两个……
One, two...

1360
01:21:50,910 --> 01:21:52,078
三。
Three.

1361
01:22:04,424 --> 01:22:06,551
——我……哇。——哇!
- My... Wow. - Whoo!

1362
01:22:16,728 --> 01:22:18,480
这是最好的一年。
This is the best year yet.

1363
01:22:21,066 --> 01:22:24,611
好了，当评委们在整理结果的时候，
All right, while the judges are tabulating the results,

1364
01:22:24,694 --> 01:22:27,864
我想唱首歌感谢你。
I would like to say thank you by singing a song.

1365
01:22:29,074 --> 01:22:30,575
嗯…
Um...

1366
01:22:30,658 --> 01:22:31,659
原谅我。
Excuse me.

1367
01:22:34,704 --> 01:22:41,169
好吧。最后，最后一场表演，请允许我介绍提奥·摩西。
Okay. For our final, final performance, may I present Theo Moses.

1368
01:22:44,339 --> 01:22:45,590
——哇!——哇!
- Whoo! - Whoo!

1369
01:22:51,638 --> 01:22:54,265
你们的人数比我预料的要多得多。
There are a lot more of you than I expected.

1370
01:23:16,788 --> 01:23:19,582
你知道吗?让我……
You know what? Let me just...

1371
01:23:23,503 --> 01:23:25,505
魔法就是感知……
Magic is all about perception...

1372
01:23:26,297 --> 01:23:29,634
你所看到的和实际发生的。
What you're seeing versus what's really happening.

1373
01:23:30,135 --> 01:23:31,469
就像现在。
Like right now.

1374
01:23:31,553 --> 01:23:33,680
你看不见我手里的一副牌，
You don't see a deck of cards in my hands,

1375
01:23:33,763 --> 01:23:37,475
但是…现在你做的事情。
but... now you do.

1376
01:23:39,394 --> 01:23:41,688
我需要一个助手来玩这个把戏。
I'm going to need an assistant for this trick.

1377
01:23:42,272 --> 01:23:44,983
妈妈，你能上来帮我一下吗?
Mom, can you please come up here and help me out?

1378
01:23:47,318 --> 01:23:49,654
哇。他真的拥有它了。
Wow. He's really owning it out there.

1379
01:23:50,655 --> 01:23:51,740
你知道他会的。
As you knew he would.

1380
01:23:51,823 --> 01:23:54,510
你能把这些都看一遍确保它们都是不同的吗?
Can you just look through these just to make sure they're all different?

1381
01:23:54,534 --> 01:23:55,994
别人看见我了吗?
Have the others seen me?

1382
01:23:56,077 --> 01:23:58,788
-我看不错。-不，不，他们不知道你在这里。
- Looks good to me. - No, no, they have no idea you're here.

1383
01:23:58,872 --> 01:24:01,166
一副牌有五十二张，
Fifty-two cards in the deck,

1384
01:24:01,249 --> 01:24:03,668
但每一个都有不同的故事。
but each one has a different story to tell.

1385
01:24:04,544 --> 01:24:07,672
我知道他们自己能做到。现在他们也知道了。
I knew they could do it on their own. Now they know it too.

1386
01:24:07,756 --> 01:24:09,341
你把一切都计划得很完美。
You planned everything perfectly.

1387
01:24:09,758 --> 01:24:11,801
不，我觉得你有。
No, I think you did.

1388
01:24:13,219 --> 01:24:15,305
我吗?
Me?

1389
01:24:15,388 --> 01:24:20,101
小丑有点像个未知数，就像我的弟弟卡梅隆一样。
The joker is a bit of a wild card, just like my little brother, Cameron.

1390
01:24:20,810 --> 01:24:23,855
他有时会惹恼我，但没有他我会不知所措。
He annoys me sometimes, but I'd be lost without him.

1391
01:24:24,522 --> 01:24:26,362
事实上，卡梅隆，你过来一下。
In fact, Cameron, why don't you come over here.

1392
01:24:26,399 --> 01:24:28,568
在从维加斯回来的路上，我把它拼在了一起。
On the drive back from Vegas, I put it together.

1393
01:24:28,651 --> 01:24:32,280
整个夏天，新手铺，黑木，西奥。
This whole summer, the newbie bunk, Darkwood, Theo.

1394
01:24:32,364 --> 01:24:34,991
如果你想看得更清楚，可以靠近一点。
Feel free to come closer if you want a better look.

1395
01:24:35,658 --> 01:24:38,286
这是一个很长的技巧来帮助我恢复我的生活。
It's one long trick to help me get my life together.

1396
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:40,163
你知道他们怎么说的。
Well, you know what they say.

1397
01:24:40,246 --> 01:24:42,957
你不相信的把戏才是最好的把戏。
The trick you don't believe is a trick is the best trick of all.

1398
01:24:43,416 --> 01:24:46,461
在这个世界上创造更多魔法的方式
The way to create more magic in the world

1399
01:24:46,544 --> 01:24:48,797
不是通过创造更多的魔法。
is not by creating more magic.

1400
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,650
——没错。-是啊，我还是不明白
- Exactly. - Yeah, I still don't get that one.

1401
01:24:50,674 --> 01:24:52,133
你还没让我说完。
You didn't let me finish.

1402
01:24:52,217 --> 01:24:55,095
通过创造魔术师。
It's by creating magicians.

1403
01:24:55,762 --> 01:25:00,141
这张牌是我，红心j。
This card is me, the jack of hearts.

1404
01:25:01,476 --> 01:25:03,687
你真好，老头子。
You are good, old man.

1405
01:25:03,770 --> 01:25:06,147
这张卡片是我爸爸…
And this card is my dad...

1406
01:25:08,066 --> 01:25:09,067
红心之王。
the king of hearts.

1407
01:25:10,026 --> 01:25:12,821
我每天都想着这张卡片。
I think about this card every day.

1408
01:25:14,906 --> 01:25:17,909
现在，我妈妈的卡片是红心皇后。
Now, my mom's card is the queen of hearts.

1409
01:25:18,493 --> 01:25:20,954
但她在哪里?
But where is she?

1410
01:25:21,746 --> 01:25:23,581
我告诉你一个秘密。
I'll tell you a secret.

1411
01:25:23,665 --> 01:25:26,793
有时我忘了这张卡片是相信我的。
Sometimes I forgot that this card believed in me.

1412
01:25:27,627 --> 01:25:30,839
但即使我没有意识到，
But even when I didn't realize it,

1413
01:25:30,922 --> 01:25:33,299
红心女王一直在我身边。
the queen of hearts was always there for me.

1414
01:25:37,804 --> 01:25:40,598
红心皇后。我很高兴找到了它。
The queen of hearts. So happy I found it.

1415
01:25:42,434 --> 01:25:46,938
在这副牌中，这四张牌最接近我的心。
Out of all the cards in the deck, these four are closest to my heart.

1416
01:25:47,439 --> 01:25:50,525
但我妈妈有一些特别的地方。
But there's something extra special about my mom.

1417
01:25:51,067 --> 01:25:53,528
她会改变她接触的一切。
She changes everything she touches.

1418
01:25:54,529 --> 01:25:58,199
妈妈，你能帮我碰一张卡片吗?
Mom, can you just touch a card for me?

1419
01:26:03,329 --> 01:26:05,040
什么?
What?

1420
01:26:05,123 --> 01:26:08,418
这是奇怪的。妈，你能不能再摸一个?
That's weird. Um, Mom, can you just touch another?

1421
01:26:14,507 --> 01:26:15,633
这是奇怪的。
This is strange.

1422
01:26:15,717 --> 01:26:18,678
这副牌中应该只有一个红心皇后。
There's only supposed to be one queen of hearts in the deck.

1423
01:26:19,095 --> 01:26:21,473
好吧，妈妈，帮我把手。
Okay, Mom, just hold your hand out for me.

1424
01:26:35,779 --> 01:26:40,325
我不知道她是怎么做到的，也不知道为什么我这么久才意识到，
I don't know how she does it, or why it took me this long to realize it,

1425
01:26:40,408 --> 01:26:46,039
但是…我妈妈很有魔力。
but... my mother is magic.

1426
01:26:46,122 --> 01:26:49,918
哦。
Aw.

1427
01:27:03,682 --> 01:27:06,518
是的,是的!什么是竞争。
Yes, yes! What a competition.

1428
01:27:06,601 --> 01:27:08,687
美丽。好吧。
Beautiful. All right.

1429
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:15,402
现在，今年高帽比赛的冠军是…
And now, the winner of this year's Top Hat competition is...

1430
01:27:17,654 --> 01:27:19,072
非常感谢你的到来。
Thank you so much for coming.

1431
01:27:19,155 --> 01:27:21,825
来吧，多一点幽默感。我们开始吧。
Come on, get a sense of humor. Here we go.

1432
01:27:21,908 --> 01:27:24,369
好吧。
All right.

1433
01:27:24,452 --> 01:27:29,082
今年大礼帽的冠军是…
And the winner for the Top Hat this year...

1434
01:27:30,083 --> 01:27:32,794
的心。
the Hearts.

1435
01:27:32,877 --> 01:27:34,796
我们赢了!我们赢了!
We won! We won!

1436
01:27:35,839 --> 01:27:37,340
——安迪?——这是安迪。
- Andy? - It's Andy.

1437
01:27:38,091 --> 01:27:41,469
我真为你们骄傲。我都看到了，伙计。
I'm so proud of you guys. I saw the whole thing, buddy.

1438
01:27:41,553 --> 01:27:43,054
——是的!——好的。很好。
- Yes! - Okay. Very good.

1439
01:27:43,847 --> 01:27:45,348
现在是…
And now for the...

1440
01:27:46,182 --> 01:27:47,976
现在的…
Now for the...

1441
01:27:48,518 --> 01:27:51,187
金魔杖的赢家，
The winner of the Golden Wand,

1442
01:27:51,271 --> 01:27:54,190
《钻石》，詹妮尔·桑托斯。
from the Diamonds, Janelle Santos.

1443
01:27:54,774 --> 01:27:56,192
起床。
Get up here.

1444
01:27:57,402 --> 01:27:59,654
走了。鞠躬。
Go. Take a bow.

1445
01:28:06,953 --> 01:28:09,372
——什么?-克里斯蒂娜，我成功了!我做到了!
- What? - Kristina, I did it! I did it!

1446
01:28:10,081 --> 01:28:11,624
我真为你骄傲。
I am so proud of you.

1447
01:28:11,708 --> 01:28:14,544
你在这里做什么?你的大型演出怎么了?
What are you doing here? What happened to your big show?

1448
01:28:14,627 --> 01:28:15,837
我跳过它。
I skipped it.

1449
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:18,256
伙计，我看了你的全套装备。
And, dude, I saw your whole set.

1450
01:28:19,466 --> 01:28:23,178
什么?我讨厌说这个词，因为我讨厌这个词，
What? I hate to say this phrase because I hate this phrase,

1451
01:28:23,261 --> 01:28:25,847
但我的头脑真的被震撼了。
but my mind was literally blown.

1452
01:28:25,930 --> 01:28:28,099
等待。你把镜子放在那里。
Wait. You put that mirror there.

1453
01:28:28,183 --> 01:28:31,227
你知道，有时候需要别人来帮助你看清自己。
You know, sometimes it takes somebody else to help you see yourself.

1454
01:28:31,978 --> 01:28:35,732
哇。你的声音和普雷斯顿一模一样。
Wow. You just sounded exactly like Preston.

1455
01:28:36,399 --> 01:28:37,650
-是的，不是吗?-是的。
- I did, didn't I? - Yeah.

1456
01:28:37,734 --> 01:28:38,735
好的，我们会解决的。
Okay, we'll work on that.

1457
01:28:38,818 --> 01:28:40,153
你能为我鼓掌两次吗?
Can you clap twice for me?

1458
01:28:41,363 --> 01:28:43,198
你会跺脚吗?
Can you stomp your feet?

1459
01:28:43,281 --> 01:28:44,657
分解它。
Break it down.

1460
01:28:49,204 --> 01:28:50,705
哇!
Whoo!

1461
01:28:57,796 --> 01:28:59,631
谢谢你！你的铺位太糟糕了。
Thank you. Your bunk killed it.

1462
01:28:59,714 --> 01:29:01,234
-非常感谢你做的一切。——再见。
- Thanks so much for everything. - Bye.

1463
01:29:01,299 --> 01:29:05,929
嘿。我很抱歉不能参加《金银岛》的演出。
Hey. I am so sorry about ditching the Treasure Island show.

1464
01:29:06,721 --> 01:29:08,282
我没给你惹太多麻烦吧?
I didn't get you in too much trouble, did I?

1465
01:29:08,306 --> 01:29:09,766
不,它很好。
No, it's fine.

1466
01:29:09,849 --> 01:29:11,726
他们实际上邀请你下周末再来。
They actually invited you back next weekend.

1467
01:29:12,352 --> 01:29:13,853
——真的吗?——没有。
- Really? - No.

1468
01:29:13,937 --> 01:29:15,689
他们终身禁止你。
They banned you for life.

1469
01:29:15,772 --> 01:29:18,566
安迪，那真是一场盛大的演出。
Andy, that was a really big gig.

1470
01:29:18,650 --> 01:29:21,861
幸运的是，我钓到了一个更大的。
Well, luckily, I landed an even bigger one.

1471
01:29:22,404 --> 01:29:24,447
——你做了吗?在哪里?——在这里。
- You did? Where? - Right here.

1472
01:29:25,073 --> 01:29:28,702
你现在看到的是新上任的青年人才发展部主任。
You are looking at the new director of youth talent development.

1473
01:29:29,828 --> 01:29:32,163
普雷斯顿为我安排了一项全年的儿童童子军活动。
Preston offered me a year-round gig scouting for kids.

1474
01:29:32,664 --> 01:29:34,666
——太好了。-这就是我想去的地方。
- That's great. - This is where I wanna be.

1475
01:29:34,749 --> 01:29:40,505
最疯狂的是，我在维加斯的舞台上意识到这一点。
And the craziest part is, is I realized that when I was on stage in Vegas.

1476
01:29:40,588 --> 01:29:43,258
但是我的朋友说你做得很好。观众喜欢你。
But my friend said that you did great. The audience loved you.

1477
01:29:43,341 --> 01:29:45,343
是的。我杀了。
Yeah. I killed.

1478
01:29:45,427 --> 01:29:47,721
我要实现我的梦想。
I got to live the dream.

1479
01:29:47,804 --> 01:29:49,389
它是令人惊异的。
It was amazing.

1480
01:29:49,472 --> 01:29:53,018
但奇怪的是，感觉并没有那么棒
But weird part is, is it didn't feel as amazing

1481
01:29:53,101 --> 01:29:55,437
今年夏天帮助孩子们。
as helping the kids this summer.

1482
01:29:56,438 --> 01:29:57,439
安迪。
Andy.

1483
01:29:57,897 --> 01:30:01,484
你可以留下来和我一起工作。
You know, you could stick around and work here with me.

1484
01:30:03,111 --> 01:30:05,572
你们应该知道我在凯撒的标题吧?
You do know I headline at Caesars, right?

1485
01:30:06,239 --> 01:30:08,867
是的。我想我听说过。那很酷。那很酷。
Yeah. I think I heard about that. That's cool. That's cool.

1486
01:30:08,950 --> 01:30:10,952
但你可以找个时间来帮我。
But you could come feature for me sometime.

1487
01:30:11,036 --> 01:30:13,705
这个世界需要一点abraca duo。
The world could use a little Abraca-Duo.

1488
01:30:14,456 --> 01:30:15,457
交易。
Deal.

1489
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:18,126
-哇，那真是个糟糕的名字。-是的。
- And, wow, that is a really terrible name. - Yeah.

1490
01:30:21,046 --> 01:30:22,047
嗨,爸爸。
Hey, Dad.

1491
01:30:22,130 --> 01:30:23,131
贾德。
Judd.

1492
01:30:24,424 --> 01:30:26,968
我不明白你的意思。你为什么没有表演?
I don't understand. Why didn't you perform?

1493
01:30:27,052 --> 01:30:28,720
不，我表演了。
No, I did perform.

1494
01:30:28,803 --> 01:30:31,848
所有红心的戏服，都是我的。
All the Hearts' costumes, those are me.

1495
01:30:33,016 --> 01:30:36,186
那些服装是你设计的?甚至是快速变化的惯例?
You designed those costumes? Even the quick-change routine?

1496
01:30:36,603 --> 01:30:38,146
他们所有人。
All of them.

1497
01:30:38,229 --> 01:30:40,440
我知道你想让我当魔术师
Look, I know you want me to be a magician,

1498
01:30:40,523 --> 01:30:43,693
但是…今年夏天，我意识到我不是。
but... this summer I realized I'm not one.

1499
01:30:43,777 --> 01:30:45,653
我就是喜欢设计服装。
I just love designing costumes.

1500
01:30:45,737 --> 01:30:49,616
我喜欢用时尚给我的朋友们带来神奇的生活。
I love using fashion to bring my friends' magic to life.

1501
01:30:50,992 --> 01:30:52,410
那你就错了……
Then you're mistaken...

1502
01:30:55,038 --> 01:30:57,374
因为，孩子，这很神奇。
because that, son, is magic.

1503
01:30:59,084 --> 01:31:01,795
我想我鼻子里有毛了。我要去灌水。
I think I got fur in my nose. I'm gonna go irrigate.

1504
01:31:10,136 --> 01:31:12,764
——嘿!我的天啊。哇。薛西斯,嘿!我会想你的。
- Hey! My gosh. Wow. - Xerxes, hey! I'm gonna miss you.

1505
01:31:13,473 --> 01:31:14,474
当心!
Look out!

1506
01:31:16,267 --> 01:31:18,829
-你怎么做到的?你得告诉我。-你真的想知道?
- How'd you do that? You have to tell me. - You really wanna know?

1507
01:31:18,853 --> 01:31:20,814
-是的。-明年来和我一起野营吧。
- Yeah. - Come to camp with me next year.

1508
01:31:20,897 --> 01:31:22,315
-我可以吗，妈妈?——不。
- Can I, Mom? - Nope.

1509
01:31:22,399 --> 01:31:25,485
因为明年夏天你要和我一起去露营。瑜伽阵营。
'Cause next summer you're going to camp with me. Yoga camp.

1510
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:26,569
你说什么?
Say what?

1511
01:31:27,487 --> 01:31:30,699
好吧，我会考虑的。
All right, I'll think about it.

1512
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:33,326
-你能相信吗?——我知道。
- Can you believe it? - I know.

1513
01:31:35,203 --> 01:31:36,746
-嗨。-我们去吃点东西吧。
- Hey. - Let's go get a snack.

1514
01:31:36,830 --> 01:31:37,831
好吧。
Okay.

1515
01:31:38,707 --> 01:31:42,794
你在外面挺不错的。
You were, pretty okay out there.

1516
01:31:42,877 --> 01:31:44,337
谢谢,维克。
Thanks, Vic.

1517
01:31:46,673 --> 01:31:48,550
你应该把这些拿回来。
You should have these back.

1518
01:31:49,718 --> 01:31:53,054
我没有烧它们。我刚把它们放进口袋了。
I didn't burn them. I just pocketed them.

1519
01:31:53,722 --> 01:31:55,306
我知道，不酷。
I know, not cool.

1520
01:31:55,765 --> 01:31:57,600
明年我就不会这么混蛋了，好吗?
I won't be such a jerk next year, all right?

1521
01:31:57,684 --> 01:32:03,732
但我将与你为金魔杖而战，夺回我魔法营的霸主地位。
But I will battle you for the Golden Wand and regain my magic camp supremacy.

1522
01:32:05,025 --> 01:32:06,192
那就等到明年夏天吧。
Till next summer then.

1523
01:32:14,993 --> 01:32:16,161
西奥。
Theo.

1524
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:18,413
嘿。
Hey.

1525
01:32:18,496 --> 01:32:19,497
嘿。
Hey.

1526
01:32:20,540 --> 01:32:22,375
我现在得走了。
I have to go now.

1527
01:32:25,628 --> 01:32:26,921
那太糟了。
That's too bad.

1528
01:32:27,464 --> 01:32:30,133
-你会打电话给我吗?-我一到家
- You gonna call me? - The second I get home.

1529
01:32:30,216 --> 01:32:31,843
这样你就不会忘记。
Just so you don't forget.

1530
01:32:34,346 --> 01:32:35,930
哇!
Whoa!

1531
01:32:36,014 --> 01:32:39,267
她去了，只是…过于激进。
She went for it, just... Too aggressive.

1532
01:32:44,689 --> 01:32:47,525
你鼓励我鼓励她参与…
You did encourage me to encourage her to participate...

1533
01:32:48,735 --> 01:32:50,320
这就是你们。
so this is you guys.

1534
01:32:55,533 --> 01:32:57,160
有一个声音在你的脑海里。
There's a voice in your head.

1535
01:32:57,243 --> 01:33:00,955
那个声音在喊着:“把你的房间打扫干净!”
And that voice is crying out, "Clean up your room!"

1536
01:33:02,082 --> 01:33:06,044
不,对不起。那是你爸爸的声音。
Nope, sorry. That was the voice of your dad.

你脑子里的声音在说:“我想成为一个魔术师。”

1538
01:33:10,757 --> 01:33:14,260
四年前，罗伊·普雷斯顿，
Scribbity-four-ish years ago this guy, Roy Preston,

Which is sadly now the Roy Preston Memorial Theater.

1541
01:33:24,521 --> 01:33:26,481
在开玩笑。我还在这里。
Kidding. I'm still here.

1542
01:33:27,023 --> 01:33:29,025
我请安迪来帮我。
I brought in Andy to help me out.

你将与其他年轻的魔术师建立持久的关系。

1545
01:33:34,364 --> 01:33:37,075
因为在这里，我们都是怪胎。

1546

午餐也有不含乳制品的选择。

1548
01:33:41,746 --> 01:33:43,498
但不要相信我的话。
But don't take my word for it.

1549
01:33:43,915 --> 01:33:45,750
问问我们以前的露营者

1551
01:33:50,255 --> 01:33:52,424
像我一样，克里斯汀娜·达伍德。
Like me, Kristina Darkwood.

1552
01:33:52,882 --> 01:33:55,510
或者你可以亲自到……
Or better yet, come see for yourself at...

1553
01:33:55,593 --> 01:33:58,096
神奇的营地!

1554
01:33:58,805 --> 01:34:00,515
