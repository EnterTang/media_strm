1
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,800
英国国王亨利五世和法国国王查尔斯六世

2
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:41,920
于1420年签订了特鲁瓦条约

3
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,920
条约规定法国附属于英国 直至国王死去

4
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,920
随后两个国王相继死去

5
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,920
年仅几个月的亨利六世 成为了英格兰及法兰西的国王

6
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,200
查尔斯七世 法兰西皇太子

7
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,920
则不情愿把国家交给一个小孩或是他老师贝德福德公爵手中

8
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,920
一场血战在所难免 英国随同勃艮第人开始侵略法国

9
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,920
罗亚尔河 这道天然屏障 暂时挡住了侵略者

10
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,920
查尔斯七世避难于希农 他渴望到兰斯去加冕为法国国王

11
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,920
可是兰斯正在英国人的手中

12
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,920
法国正在经历历史上最黑暗的时期

13
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,920
能拯救法国的只有

14
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,920
奇迹

15
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,920
是谁?
Is anybody there?

16
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,060
贞德
Jeanne.

17
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,630
见到你我很高兴 可是你一天来两三次...
I'm always happy to see you, but to keep coming twice, three times a day...

18
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,770
 我要忏悔  可你早晨已经忏悔过了
 I need to confess.  You already confessed this morning.

19
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,640
我要再忏悔一次
I need to confess again.

20
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,110
什么样的罪孽...
What terrible sin have you committed since then...

21
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,840
让你一天都无法等待?
that can't wait till tomorrow to be forgiven?

22
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,850
我看见一个修道士没穿鞋 就给了他几双
I saw a poor monk without shoes, so I gave him some.

23
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,890
施舍是没有罪过的 贞德
There's no sin in charity,Jeanne.

24
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,450
 可那些鞋不是我的  那是谁的?
 They weren't my shoes.  Whose were they?

25
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,790
 是我爸爸的  我相信他会原谅你的
 My father's.  I'm sure he'll forgive you.

26
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,990
他已经原谅我了
He already did.

27
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,000
但我希望耶稣也能原谅我
But I wantJesus to forgive me too.

28
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,590
如果一直祈求宽恕罪过
If we were to ask forgiveness all the time...

29
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,600
那就要在教堂呆一辈子了
we'd spend our whole life in church.

30
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:29,070
 那样不好吗?  不是不好 只是...
 Is that bad?  Well, no, but...

31
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,770
 你在家快乐吗?  是的 很快乐
 Are you happy at home?  Oh, yes, very.

32
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,150
你母亲呢? 她好吗?
And your mother? Everything's fine with her?

33
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,690
是 她好极了
Yes, she's wonderful.

34
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,810
那你姐姐凯瑟琳呢 还一直是你的好朋友吗?
And your sister, Catherine, she's still your best friend?

35
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,850
我姐姐...好极了
My sister's just...She's wonderful.

36
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,830
那你其他的朋友呢? 你常跟他们一起玩吗?
And what about your other friends? You don't like playing with them?

37
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,830
是的 我们常在一起玩
Oh, yes. I play with them, lots.

38
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,800
那一切都好极了
Everything sounds wonderful.

39
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,600
是的
Yes, it is.

40
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,370
那你为什么还总是来这里呢?
Then why are you here so often?

41
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,380
我在这里感到安全 在这里我可以跟他说话
I feel safe here. It's where I can talk to him.

42
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,940
他?
Him?

43
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,750
我也想跟他说几句...
Well, I try to talk to him...

44
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,550
可大部分时候都是他一个人在说
but mostly he's the one who does the talking.

45
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,390
这个"他"是谁?
Who is this "he"?

46
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,030
他没说过他的名字
He never says his name.

47
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,900
那他...
What does he...

48
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,870
长什么样子?
look like?

49
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,170
漂亮极了
Beautiful.

50
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,650
他都跟你说些什么?
What does he say to you?

51
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,380
他说...
He says...

52
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:57,800
他说我要做个好人...
He says...He says I must be good...

53
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,890
多帮助他人 照顾好自己
and help everyone and take care of myself.

54
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,200
你说他是从天上来的吗?
Do you think he's coming from the sky?

55
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,100
可能吧
Perhaps.

56
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,840
可不管他是哪里来 我觉得听他的没错...
But wherever he's coming from, I think you should listen to him...

57
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,580
那确实是个好建议
'cause it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.

58
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,540
真是 真是好极了!
It's...It's wonderful!

59
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,470
真是好极了
It's wonderful.

60
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,620
贞德
Jeanne.

61
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,930
妈妈!
Mother!

62
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,450
凯瑟琳!
Catherine!

63
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,290
贞德 你还好吧? 他们没伤到你吧?
Jeanne, are you all right? Did they hurt you?

64
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,130
我很好
I'm fine, really.

65
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,730
我们一直在找你 现在到处都是英国人
We've all been looking for you. The English are everywhere.

66
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,770
 我去教堂了  是吗?
 I was in the church.  Really?

67
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,240
我去找牧师了 你知道他对我说什么吗?
I was talking to the priest. Do you know what he said to me?

68
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,240
烧掉那里!
Burn over there!

69
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,780
以后再说吧 快藏进来
Tell me later. Quick, hide in here.

70
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,010
 那你去哪里?  我就在这里 哪儿也不去
 Where are you gonna be?  I'll be right here.

71
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,670
我保证
I promise.

72
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,860
噢 那就是我说的战利品了
Well, that's what I call booty.

73
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,020
伙计
Comrade.

74
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,310
这女人还有把剑
A woman with a sword.

75
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,050
你们看
Look at this.

76
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,990
法国男人真是孬种 居然让女人去打仗
Frenchmen are such cowards, they've left all the fightin' to women.

77
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,020
如果那是上帝的意愿 那就没错的
If that's God's will, then so be it.

78
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:18,890
那正和我口味 我喜欢女人
Fine with me. I love women.

79
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,910
别动 臭婊子
Hold still, bitch.

80
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,250
你扭来扭去我怎么办事儿?
How can I do it if you keep wriggling about?

81
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,340
轮到你们了
Your turn now.

82
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:15,210
主啊 保佑这些逝者的灵魂吧
God, preserve and bless the soul of this, our dearly departed.

83
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,720
并让我们远离恐惧和罪恶 阿门
Keep us safe from fear and sin. Amen.

84
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,620
开始吧
Come on.

85
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,900
听我说 贞德
Listen,Jeanne.

86
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:12,670
你姨妈要带你去她家住几星期
Your aunt and uncle are gonna take you to their house for a couple of weeks...

87
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,710
好让我们重建这里
just to give us time to rebuild things here.

88
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,440
明白了吗?
You understand?

89
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,650
上帝 感谢您赐予我们食物
Lord, we give thanks for the food you've given us.

90
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,660
教会我们热爱自己的家园
Teach us always to love this land...

91
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,630
并保护它不受坏人的破坏
and to save it from those who seek to destroy it.

92
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,290
 阿门  阿门
 Amen.  Amen.

93
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,480
晚安
So, good night, then.

94
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:20,860
 她以后会怎么样呢?  她会没事的
 What's going to happen to her?  She'll be fine.

95
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:25,370
慢慢长大 嫁个好人 生几个孩子 你就别担心了
She'll grow up, find a good man, make him some children. Don't worry.

96
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,170
她是受过伤害 可她活过来了
She's been hurt, but she'll survive.

97
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,230
明天她就会一切顺利了
Tomorrow she'll be as right as rain.

98
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,540
你等着看吧
You'll see.

99
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,550
我要见牧师
I want to see a priest.

100
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:05,570
 为什么非要她去死?  这只有上帝能回答
 Why did she have to die?  Only God can answer that.

101
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,210
我知道耶稣说要爱你的敌人 可我做不到
I know Jesus says to love your enemies, but I can't.

102
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,410
我盼着那些英国佬 在地狱受尽煎熬 永不翻身!
I just want the English to burn in hell forever and ever!

103
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,980
我知道你很愤怒 贞德
I realize your anger,Jeanne.

104
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,580
可我们必须学会宽恕 它是很难...
But we must learn to forgive. It's hard...

105
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:23,360
但报仇是不会带来和平的
but revenge will never bring about peace.

106
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,020
那什么可以呢? 怎样做她才能回来呢?
What will? And what will bring her back?

107
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,000
为什么先死的人是她而不是我?
And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?

108
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,700
他为什么不要我的生命而要她的?
Why didn't He take my life instead of hers?

109
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:35,370
都是我的错! 是我回来晚了!
It was my fault! I was late!

110
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,940
她把自己的藏身地方给了我! 可他为什么要救我呢?
She gave me her hiding place! Why did He save me?

111
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:43,110
冷静些 贞德 冷静些
Calm down,Jeanne. Calm down.

112
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,320
我不会假装了解上帝的意愿...
I don't pretend to know God's will...

113
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:52,220
可有一点我确信不疑
but one thing I am sure:

114
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:56,490
上帝这么做自会有他的理由
The Lord always has a good reason.

115
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,960
他选择你可能是因为他需要你
Perhaps He chose you because He needs you...

116
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,760
为了某种更高的感召
for some higher calling.

117
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,700
只要你响应了那感召...
As long as you answer that call...

118
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:09,570
你姐姐的死就不会是毫无价值的了
your sister will not have died in vain.

119
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,110
我不想等他的召唤
I don't want to wait for His call.

120
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,110
耐心些
Be patient.

121
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,670
我要一直与他同在
I want to be with Him always.

122
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,240
你会一直与他同在的
Soon you will be able to take part in your Holy Mass.

123
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,620
等你可以领圣餐时...
When you eat of His flesh and drink of His blood...

124
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,680
你就将与他同在
you will be at one with Him.

125
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,850
我现在就要
I want to be at one with Him now.

126
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,830
牧师他说什么?
So, what did he say?

127
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,800
他说不管她何时想来教堂 我们就要带她过来
He says we must bring her to church whenever she wants.

128
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:44,240
他说的容易 反正又不是他来接送
Easy for him. He's not the one who has to do the bringing.

129
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,440
别这么说 这很重要的
Come on. This is important.

130
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:49,710
我们不能让她离开我们的视线
We mustn't let her out of our sight.

131
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,680
别担心 我会像看自己的影子一样看着她
Don't worry. I will watch her like my own shadow.

132
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,600
我现在就要与你同在
I want to be at one with You now.

133
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,600
给法国皇太子的信
A message for the dauphin of France.

134
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,740
给皇太子殿下的信
A message.

135
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,920
队长 这是给皇太子殿下的信
Captain, a message for the dauphin.

136
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,400
放那里吧
I'll take it.

137
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,130
皇太子殿下! 皇太子殿下!
The dauphin! The dauphin!

138
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:12,690
路易斯 怎么没去上课?
Louis. Louis. Hey. Shouldn't you be learning your lessons?

139
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,820
我不想上课 我想学搏击
I don't want to learn. I want to fight.

140
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:18,800
那个你以后会学的 现在还是先学学擦鼻子吧
You will. But for now, you must at least learn to wipe your nose.

141
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,530
有殿下的信
A letter for His Majesty.

142
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,710
又是那自称是洛林处女的人寄来的
Another one from this girl calling herself the Maiden of Lorraine.

143
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,970
我自己不会读么?
I can read for myself, you know?

144
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:39,640
她说她是上帝派来的 真是吹牛
She pretends she's been sent by God. Charlatans.

145
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,850
没能把她们全都烧死 真是太可惜了
It's a pity there isn't enough wood to burn them all.

146
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,820
 她说她明天就到这里了  殿下 您不能见她
 She says she'll be here tomorrow.  You mustn't see her, My Lord.

147
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:48,520
您根本不了解她 甚至不知道她是不是从洛林来的
We know nothing about her. We don't even know if she's from Lorraine.

148
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,820
她从哪里来很重要吗?
What difference does it make where she comes from?

149
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,960
如果她是从勃艮第来的 那就不一样了
If she comes from Burgundy, it makes a difference.

150
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,590
这可能是个圈套 您看 署名为"X"
It might be a trap. Look, signed "X."

151
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,160
"X"算是个什么名字呢?
What sort of a name is "X"?

152
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,430
莫非上帝的使者连自己的名字都不会写?
Or must we assume that a messenger of God can't even write her own name?

153
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:03,770
殿下 特利莫伊说的很对 她还说她能听见主的声音
My Lord, Tremoille is correct. She says she hears voices.

154
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,240
她可能是个女巫 一个巫婆
She may be a sorceress, a witch.

155
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:09,580
勒诺尔 在你眼里谁都是巫师
Regnault, you see witches everywhere.

156
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,840
她只是个农民罢了
She's just a peasant.

157
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,220
一个关心国王的农民
A peasant who cares about her king.

158
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:19,590
她想要我加冕为王 然后为我而战
All she wants is to see me crowned and permission to fight for me.

159
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:23,490
不只是这样 她要您给她一支军队 军费您出
Not exactly. She wants you to give her an army at your expense.

160
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,790
记住您母亲已经把国库花了个精光了
Bearing in mind your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury...

161
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:29,100
您是冒不起这个险的
I fail to see how you can afford such an adventure.

162
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,100
愿意的话我会见她的
I can see her if I want to.

163
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,800
一半的法国都落到英国人手里了
After all, with half of France in the hands of the English...

164
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,280
我还有什么好失去的?
what have I got to lose?

165
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,440
另一半
The other half.

166
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,880
殿下 您一定不能见她
You mustn't see her, Your Majesty.

167
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,040
她可能是魔鬼派来的
She may be an instrument of the devil.

168
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,950
我倒认为你该见见
Well, I think you should.

169
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,790
这下有趣了
Well, here's an amusing situation.

170
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,520
我深爱的母亲
I would love to know why my devoted mother in law thinks one thing...

171
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,930
跟两个我最信赖的顾问
and my two most loyal and trusted advisors...

172
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,940
意见为何会截然相反
think precisely the opposite.

173
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,060
因为我关心你 过来
Because I care about you. Come here.

174
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,940
你的幸福健康一直是我最关心的事 查尔斯
Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles...

175
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,110
从小到大
ever since you were a little boy.

176
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,120
我比你的生母还要了解你
And I think I know you better than your own mother.

177
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:29,660
您真这么想?
You think so, eh?

178
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:32,060
是的
Yes.

179
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:35,460
比如说 我知道你受心病的折磨
I know, for example, the sickness that plagues your heart.

180
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:38,700
我知道你很痛苦 因为你要爱你的父亲...
I know how painful it is for you to have loved a father...

181
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:42,500
但你甚至不知道他究竟是不是
without ever knowing if he was really yours.

182
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,510
我很了解你吧?
Do I know you enough? Hmm?

183
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,940
那些跟这个少女有什么关系?
What has that got to do with this maiden?

184
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:55,320
由上帝的信使回答你再合适不过了
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?

185
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,150
你认为她是上帝派来的?
You think she was sent from God?

186
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,320
你很会看人的 查尔斯
You're a fine judge of character, Charles.

187
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:04,290
如果她是假的话 你不到五分钟就能看穿她
It'll take you less than five minutes to expose her if she's a fake.

188
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,090
但如果她是真的...
But if she's not...

189
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,670
那她将会给你问题的答案
then she will give you your answers...

190
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:17,170
还会把皇冠戴在你的头上
and place the crown on your head.

191
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:23,610
尊敬的夫人 见一个乡下女孩...
With respect to my lady, I think it's going to take more than a peasant girl...

192
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,950
我对你怎么想不感兴趣 特利莫伊
I'm not interested in what you think, Tremoille...

193
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,580
我怎么想也不重要
or even what I think.

194
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:30,490
那些朴实的百姓怎么想才最重要...
It's what simple people think that matters, and the fact is that...

195
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:35,960
事实是现在全国上下都在讨论她
simple people up and down this country are already talking about her.

196
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:38,430
你知道的 百姓总是喜欢相信...
Now, you know what simple people are like...

197
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,300
古老的预言
always ready to believe any old prophecy.

198
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,300
比如这个...
Like this one...

199
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:50,740
洛林来的处女...
about a virgin from Lorraine...

200
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:53,510
拯救了法兰西
saving France.

201
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,140
现在...
And now...

202
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:03,290
那个女孩出现了...
this girl comes along...

203
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,950
正从洛林赶来
from Lorraine.

204
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:10,020
百姓的心中会迸发出希望的火花
And suddenly, there's a spark of hope in their simple minds.

205
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:20,430
你不能让他们失望
You shouldn't disappoint them.

206
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:23,870
如果他们相信她...
If they believe in her...

207
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,810
如果她能重新点燃军队的斗志...
if she can put back the fire in our army...

208
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,400
那我也会信她的
then I believe in her too.

209
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,590
停下!
Stop it!

210
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,700
路易斯 安静一会儿
Louis, be quiet for once.

211
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,160
 她来了 殿下  知道了
 She's coming, Your Majesty.  All right.

212
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,820
镇定些
Calm yourself.

213
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,960
殿下 我真心劝您不要见这个女人
Your Majesty, I urge you not to see this woman.

214
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,960
绝对是勃艮第人设下的圈套
It all reeks of a Burgundian trap.

215
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:24,560
占星师告诉我现在是吉时 狮子座和处女座都升起来了
My astrologers assure me the timing is propitious: Leo with Virgo rising.

216
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,940
你看没看过占星图
Have you never noticed on the astrological chart...

217
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:30,500
处女座就在狮子座旁边知道吗?
that the virgin is next to the lion?

218
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,510
你说她会是刺客?
Supposing she's an assassin?

219
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:36,300
我亲爱的特利莫伊...
My My My dear Tremoille...

220
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,320
我还不是国王呢
I'm not even king yet.

221
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,480
谁会想要刺杀我?
Who would want to assassinate me?

222
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,930
她来了 殿下 现在就在卫兵室
She's arrived, My Lord. She's in the guards' room.

223
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,340
好的 好的
Fine, fine.

224
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:43,270
看来我要下决定了
I suppose I shall have to make a decision.

225
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,260
生活为何如此复杂?
Why is life so complicated?

226
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,800
有时我真希望自己是其他人
Sometimes I really wish I could be someone else.

227
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,000
好主意 殿下
That's a good idea, sire.

228
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,470
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

229
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,370
让别人假扮作你
Let someone else pretend to be you.

230
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,540
然后看她能不能发现? 真是高明
And see if she can find me? That's a brilliant idea.

231
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:18,580
如果她真是上帝派来的 她会看出来的
If she's really been sent by God, she'll discover the trap.

232
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:21,740
如果她是刺客 那她就会错杀他人 实在是高明
And if she's an assassin, she'll kill the wrong man. Brilliant.

233
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,620
请注意!
Please. Please!

234
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,000
我们要玩个小游戏
We're We're going to play a little game.

235
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:40,470
现在假装我的王位是空的
Now, let us pretend that my throne is empty.

236
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,700
只是假装而已
Just pretend.

237
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:44,710
谁想当国王?
Who wants to be king?

238
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:51,580
这画面真令人感动
Now, there's a heartwarming sight.

239
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,090
看看你们哪一个可以蒙混过关...
Now, let us see which one of you could possibly pass...

240
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,920
假扮法国国王
as the king of France.

241
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,760
艾伦 高贵的公爵
Alencon, my noble duke.

242
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:08,630
忠心的表弟 如此优秀 勇敢 富有
My royal cousin. So fine, so brave, so rich.

243
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:13,330
实在太有钱了 不能当法国的国王
So very rich. So far too rich to be king of France.

244
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:16,100
大家都知道 我是全国最穷的人
Everyone knows I'm the poorest man in my kingdom.

245
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:23,640
吉尔德雷斯 法国的元帅
Gilles de Rais. Marshall of France.

246
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,310
让男人丧胆 让女人喜爱
Formidable to men, fascinating to women.

247
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,250
让所有人恐惧不已
Feared by all.

248
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:33,520
你坐我的王位再适合不过
You would be perfect to sit on my throne.

249
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:37,050
只怕您坐得太过瘾
So perfect that you might like it too much...

250
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:40,530
让我脆弱的心不得安宁
and therefore disturb my my fragile peace of mind.

251
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,430
拉希尔
La Hire.

252
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,960
我愤怒的副将 法国最勇敢的人
My angry captain, and bravest in France.

253
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,810
经历十数场战争 但仍有胆识再杀十几次
Scarred by a dozen wars, but with a heart and a stomach for a dozen more.

254
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,680
 你可以巧扮国王  我他妈的当然可以
 You could pass for the king.  Damn bloody right I could.

255
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,720
可惜一开口就完了 因为没有人...
Until you open your mouth, because no one...

256
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:02,980
说话这样子还能扮成法国国王
with a tongue like that could possible pass as king of France.

257
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,370
看来只得由我亲自上阵
It looks like it shall have to be me after all.

258
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,730
为什么不能是你 吉恩·德奥兰?
Why not you Jean d'Aulon?

259
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:25,540
只有你比我还穷...
The only man who's poorer than I am...

260
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,910
所以我只能信赖你
therefore the only man I can trust.

261
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:33,010
高贵 正直 聪明
Dignified, honorable, wise.

262
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:35,750
不正是一个国王的风范?
What more can we ask of a king?

263
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,860
陛下 恕我不敢
My lord, I'm not sure that...

264
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,400
你不准备为国王而死吗?
Are you not prepared to die for your king?

265
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,730
 我当然准备为国王而死  那好
 Of course I am.  Good.

266
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,890
在死前尽量摆出国王架势 带她上来
Until then, feel free to live like a king. Bring her up.

267
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:02,270
陛下 你知道我不会玩这种游戏
Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.

268
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,250
假装这不是游戏
Pretend it's not a game.

269
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:08,380
为皇太子让路
Make way for the dauphin.

270
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,130
 母亲?  闭嘴
 Mother?  Not now.

271
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,860
我是来见皇太子的
I have come to see the dauphin.

272
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,520
你是谁?
Who are you?

273
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:12,650
我 我是...
I'm I'm...

274
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:16,820
最高贵的殿下 查尔斯·德·瓦卢亚...
His most gracious majesty, Charles de Valois...

275
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,830
法兰西皇太子
dauphin of France.

276
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:41,950
我看得出你是个好人
I can see you are a good man.

277
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,620
可你不是皇太子
But you're not the dauphin.

278
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:51,530
对不起 我必须见皇太子
I'm sorry to insist, but I must see the dauphin.

279
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,330
不能再耽搁了 他在哪里?
We have no time to lose. Where is he?

280
00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:00,130
他就在这里 你自己找吧
He's here. Find him yourself.

281
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,930
让你看看到底谁有资格做国王
Now you'll see who'll pass for a king.

282
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:46,070
您不必害怕 陛下
There's no need to be afraid, sire.

283
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,770
我还不是国王
I'm not the king.

284
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:54,690
您现在还不是 可马上就会成为国王了
I know you're not yet, but you will be soon.

285
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,030
退下 退下
Out. Out.

286
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,610
你怎么知道我是谁?
How did you know who I am?

287
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,640
 显然是上帝的指示  神说 "就是他"
 Her voices, of course.  "That's him," they said.

288
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:18,470
"角落里那个大鼻子的"
"The one in the corner with the big nose."

289
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,210
统统退下!
Back off!

290
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:33,490
敬爱的太子殿下
Oh, my gentle dauphin.

291
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,400
我送来了...
I have a message...

292
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,500
天堂里来的音讯...
from the King of Heaven...

293
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,630
是给您的
for you.

294
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:53,310
只您一个人
You only.

295
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:03,980
跟我来吧
Follow me.

296
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,360
殿下 我认为...
Your Majesty, I really think...

297
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:11,990
亲爱的特利莫伊
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...

298
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:14,230
你来负责没人来打搅我们
to to ensure our privacy.

299
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,330
我要跟她单独谈
I need to talk to her alone.

300
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:25,340
他要跟她单独谈
He needs to talk to her alone.

301
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,010
好啊
Fine.

302
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:46,360
我十岁那年
I was about ten years old.

303
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:49,270
那天春光明媚
It was a beautiful spring day.

304
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,640
我穿过森林走近道回家...
I was taking a shortcut home through the forest...

305
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:56,080
突然
when a strange wind...

306
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,110
刮起了一阵怪风
began to blow.

307
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:10,410
声音很奇特 就像是人在说话...
It was such a strange sound, almost like words...

308
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:12,760
在召唤我
calling me.

309
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:33,950
第二次...
The second time...

310
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,110
是在许多年后了
was many years later.

311
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:41,320
我正从教堂回来...
I was coming back from church, when suddenly...

312
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:43,690
突然 跟上次一样
the same...

313
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,290
刮起一阵暴风
violent wind.

314
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,930
然后...
Then...

315
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:58,210
一个奇特的形状...
a shape...

316
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,860
出现了...
appeared...

317
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,670
就在天空的中央
in the middle of the sky.

318
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:07,110
那个形状...
The shape...

319
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,770
很象...
of...

320
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,550
很象一个男人
of a man.

321
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,290
然后一切都动的飞快
Everything was moving so fast. So fast.

322
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,410
风啊 云啊
The wind, the clouds.

323
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,310
我无法动弹 我无法呼吸
I couldn't move. I couldn't breathe.

324
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:43,350
我吓坏了
I was so frightened.

325
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:46,040
他离我...
He was...

326
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,420
如此...
so...

327
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,080
如此...
so...

328
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,720
如此的近
here.

329
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,540
那时我明白了上帝选中了我
And then I knew that God had chosen me.

330
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:09,440
可我不知道他需要我做什么
But I did not understand what it was He wanted me to do.

331
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:13,110
我的使命是什么? 我要为我的国家做什么?
What was my mission? What could I do to help my country?

332
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,640
可是怎么做呢? 我一无所有 我只是个贫穷的小女孩
But how? I was nothing. I was just a poor girl.

333
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:21,450
不懂打仗 也不懂骑马
I did not know anything about...about making war or riding.

334
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,220
所以我决定先等待...
So I decided to wait...

335
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:28,230
没有对任何人提起过这事
and not to speak of it to anybody.

336
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,700
你做的很好 你做的很好
You did well. You did well.

337
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:33,390
没等多长时间
I didn't wait long.

338
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:39,730
我象往常一样去做弥撒...
I was going to Mass, like I do every day...

339
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:42,800
还是那样...
and the same...

340
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,070
一阵怪风...
strange wind...

341
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:17,280
然后一切都明了了
Everything was made clear.

342
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,740
上帝给了我一个音讯
God had given me a message.

343
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,780
要我传达一个音讯
A message to deliver.

344
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,160
什么...
What...

345
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,820
什么内容?
What was the message?

346
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:44,400
他说...
He said...

347
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:47,930
要我从敌人的手中拯救法兰西...
that I must save France from her enemies...

348
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:50,810
把她重新还到上帝的手中
and bring her back into the hands of God.

349
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,210
他命令我...
And He told me that I...

350
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,650
贞德...
Jeanne...

351
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,450
带您去兰斯的圣坛...
will lead you to the altar at Reims...

352
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:04,520
在那里您将加冕为...
where you will be crowned...

353
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:07,490
法兰西...
the king...

354
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:14,530
国王
of France.

355
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,390
 陛下 您还...  我很好
 Sire, are you... I'm fine.

356
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:46,700
这位是吉恩·德奥兰 我最忠诚的朋友 最棒的射手
This is, in fact,Jean d'Aulon, my loyal friend and finest archer.

357
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:49,000
你来负责照料她
I put her in your care.

358
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:52,730
在城堡中给她找个合适的住处
Find her suitable lodgings here in the castle...

359
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:54,780
守护她的安全
and guard her with your life.

360
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,110
陛下 我不需要住处 我们要进军去奥尔良
Sire, I won't be needing any lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans.

361
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,240
奥尔良已经坚守了半年了...
Orleans has held out for six months...

362
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:03,080
不急这两三天
so I don't suppose a few days more will make much difference.

363
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:04,740
好好休息一下
Take some rest.

364
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:14,020
把包放在这儿吧
Put the bags here.

365
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,530
请接受我的道歉...
Please accept my apologies...

366
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,030
我刚才假扮做...你明白的
for me pretending to be the...you know.

367
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,040
我能喝点水吗?
Do you think that I can have some water?

368
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,870
水 当然可以
Water. Yes, of course.

369
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:27,870
你去弄些水来
Would you get some water?

370
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:30,410
 还有其他的吗?  我要见牧师
 Anything else?  I need to see a priest.

371
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,540
 现在?  是的 我今天还没有作忏悔
 Now?  Yes. I didn't confess today.

372
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:39,810
好的 雷蒙德 去请牧师
All right. Raymond, a priest.

373
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:40,880
还有其他的吗?
Anything else?

374
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,550
我还需要一匹新的战马...
I shall also be needing a new war horse...

375
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:46,490
一把剑 盔甲...
a sword, armor...

376
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,090
再找位画家给我做面旗帜
and an artist to make a banner for me.

377
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:52,000
 现在?  宜早不宜迟
 Now?  Better today than tomorrow.

378
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:54,630
那可能要花些时间...
This might take a little time...

379
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:58,330
我会尽力而为的
but let me see what I can do.

380
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:02,340
还有 再找个能读会写的人来
Oh! I shall also be needing someone who can read and write.

381
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:04,380
这个我就可以
This I can do.

382
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:07,440
在英国人来之前 我一直在巴黎大学学习
I was studying at the University of Paris until the English invaded it.

383
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,180
 我以为你是个弓箭手  是啊
 I thought you were an archer.  Yes, I am.

384
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:14,850
我是个能读会写的弓箭手 您要写信给谁?
I'm an archer who can read and write. Who do you want to write to?

385
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,980
英国国王
The king of England.

386
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:22,120
在我到奥尔良之前...
I want to give him the chance to leave in peace...

387
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:27,430
给他一个和平撤军的机会
before I get to Orleans.

388
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:40,500
主教和我刚开始 和勃根地人交涉
The archbishop and I have just begun negotiations with the Burgundians.

389
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:42,260
如果能让他们站在我们这一边...
If we can bring them over to our side...

390
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:46,060
当然要交涉 不过要有力量才能交涉
Negotiate, by all means, but from a position of strength.

391
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,830
如果英军攻下奥尔良 就没有交涉的余地了
If the English take Orleans, there'll be nothing left to negotiate.

392
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:50,840
其余国土将落入英军之手
The rest of the country will be theirs.

393
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:53,780
夫人 这实在太愚蠢
My lady, it will be the height of folly...

394
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:56,870
让这个孩子率领军队
to let this child lead our army...

395
00:45:56,950 --> 00:46:00,880
以国王的名义出兵 却没有验证她的真正动机
in the king's name without verifying her true motives.

396
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:02,750
陛下 图洛伊是对的
My Lord, Tremoille is right.

397
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:07,220
我们必须完全确定 她不是魔鬼的工具
We must be absolutely certain that she is not an instrument of the devil.

398
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:11,230
这年头有什么事说得准?
How can anyone be absolutely certain about anything?

399
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:16,700
有时候你该跟着直觉走
Sometimes our intuitions are our best counselors.

400
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:20,900
在服从直觉之前必须听听教堂的说法
We must listen to Mother Holy Church before we listen to our intuitions.

401
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:27,870
等等
Wait.

402
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:33,180
她自称是处女
She claims to be a virgin.

403
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:35,950
这个我们倒可以检查...
Well, that's something we can examine...

404
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:39,390
也可以百分之百确定
and be absolutely certain about.

405
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:58,630
那就查吧
Let's find out.

406
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:33,160
如果她不是呢?
What if she's not?

407
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:35,100
如果她不是...
If she's not...

408
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,290
我就亲自杀了她
I'll kill her myself.

409
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:51,070
没有堕落或奸淫的痕迹
There is no sign of corruption or violation.

410
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:53,170
她是纯洁无瑕的
She is intact.

411
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:01,550
你看到的形象 到底穿着什么衣服?
And what, exactly, was this vision wearing?

412
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:03,150
我不记得了
I don't remember.

413
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:06,030
这个形象有给你什么吗?
This vision, did it give you anything?

414
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,960
一样东西? 戒子或念珠...
An object? A ring or a rosary...

415
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:12,760
或任何证据 让我们可以相信你的话?
or anything by which we can verify your claim?

416
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,600
他给我好的建议
He gave me good advice.

417
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:18,130
你小时候有没有军事经验?
During your childhood, did you have any sort of military experience?

418
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:19,200
没有
No.

419
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:22,100
可曾学过剑术?
Are you practiced in the skills of swordsmanship?

420
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:25,170
没有 但我很会耍棍
No, but I'm good with a stick.

421
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:32,080
你知道什么是第戎长炮吗?
Do you know what a Dijon Culverin is?

422
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:34,050
不知道
No.

423
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:35,820
是大炮的一种
It's an item of artillery.

424
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:38,360
你怎么可能解除奥尔良围城之急...
How can you expect to raise the siege of Orleans...

425
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:41,100
你对现代大炮一无所知
if you're ignorant about modern artillery?

426
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:45,070
到奥尔良的路还很长 我有优秀副将相伴
The road to Orleans is long, and I have good captains with me.

427
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,830
我会学得很快 相信我
I will learn fast, believe me.

428
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:50,200
我们很愿意相信你 贞德 但我们觉得...
We would like to believe you, Jeanne, but we feel...

429
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:53,000
如果上帝要我们相信你...
that if God wanted us to believe you...

430
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:56,410
他就会给你一个神迹
he would've sent a sign with you.

431
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,210
你可以做什么吗?
So, can you do something?

432
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:04,390
给我们看点什么吧?
Show us something?

433
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,380
这样才能证明...
A sign to prove...

434
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,390
你是上帝派来的
that you are sent by God.

435
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:16,830
我不是来表演杂耍的
I did not come here to perform tricks.

436
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,060
我...
I...

437
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:22,330
你们都比我聪明得多
You are all much cleverer than I am.

438
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:25,840
我是说我大字都不认识一个
I mean, me, I don't know "A" from "B."

439
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:28,280
但我知道这件事
But this much I do know.

440
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:32,680
当法国人民血流成河...
While the people of France lie bleeding...

441
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:34,880
你们还穿着华服坐在这里...
you sit around in your fine clothes...

442
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:36,980
想欺骗我...
trying to deceive me...

443
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:40,750
其实你们是在自欺欺人
when you're only deceiving yourselves.

444
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:43,050
你们自称是上帝的子民...
You say you are men of God...

445
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:48,060
却看不到他的手引领着我...
yet you do not see His hand in having guided me...

446
00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:53,830
穿过敌国千军万马 为你带来神的帮助
through 500 leagues of enemy country to bring you His help.

447
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,930
这还不能证明吗?
Is that not proof enough?

448
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:04,080
还是你们需要更多神迹?
Or do you still need more signs?

449
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:12,110
给我一支军队
Give me an army.

450
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:17,360
带我到奥尔良
Take me to Orleans.

451
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:23,600
到时你们就会看到 上帝派我制造的神迹
And there you will see the sign that I was sent to make.

452
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:54,690
迪努瓦
Dunois.

453
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:58,560
 什么事?  一颗大的 冲我们来了
 What?  A big one, straight at us.

454
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,370
哪一边?
What side?

455
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,300
窗户那边
Window side.

456
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:20,810
什么事?
What?

457
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:25,020
终于等到好消息了
I have wonderful news, finally.

458
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:28,060
他派她过来了 谢天谢地 我们有救了
He is sending her to us. Thanks be to God. We're saved.

459
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:29,620
真是 真是太好了
It's...It's wonderful.

460
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,670
镇静下 伊特兰斯 说清楚到底什么事?
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles. Who has finally done what?

461
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:36,130
是皇太子 他给我们送来了粮草和军队...
The dauphin. He's sending us food and supplies and an army...

462
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,930
由贞德率领 那个洛林的女子
led byJeanne, the maiden from Lorraine.

463
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:41,300
是不是很棒?
Isn't it wonderful?

464
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:43,310
是啊 简直是奇迹
Yes, it's a miracle.

465
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:50,250
真不敢相信他们派一个女人过来
I can't believe they are sending a woman.

466
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:54,120
真想知道她衣服是什么颜色的
I wonder what color dress she'll be wearing.

467
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:56,480
蓝色
Blue.

468
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,280
头发上还系着蓝丝带 用那个来勒死塔尔博特
With a blue ribbon in her hair to tie up Talbot.

469
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:06,960
有人知道她到底会骑马吗?
Does anyone know if she even knows how to ride a horse?

470
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:08,300
看来她会骑
She knows.

471
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,670
你们是迪努瓦大人派来的吗?
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?

472
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:26,220
是的
Yes, we were.

473
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:28,980
 英军在哪里?  到处都是 粮草呢?
 Where are the English?  Everywhere. Where's the food?

474
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:31,750
还在路上 我先赶来了
It's coming. I rode on ahead.

475
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:34,820
我有消息要告诉英军的将军
I have a message for the captain of the English army.

476
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,360
 他叫塔尔博特  我知道
 His name is Talbot.  I know.

477
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:40,260
 能带我去见他吗?  他在河对岸
 Can you take me to him?  He's on the other side of the river.

478
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:43,630
那谁让你带我到这边来的?
So, who gave the order for me to be brought to this side of the river?

479
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:48,870
老朋友 能再见到你这张老脸还真高兴
Hey, my friend. It's good to see your ugly damn face again.

480
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:52,170
 拉希尔 我警告过你不要说脏话  对不起 贞德
 La Hire, I'm warning you. Don't swear.  Sorry,Jeanne.

481
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:56,980
这位是国王的同父异母哥哥迪努瓦大人
Let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.

482
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:01,400
迪努瓦大人 您能带我去河对岸吗?
Lord Dunois, will you show me to the other side of the river?

483
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:05,110
等等! 等等!
Wait. Wait!

484
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:10,570
好啊! 愿意去就去吧! 我可不去
Fine! Go now, if you want! But not with me!

485
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:14,210
你要对上帝负责 我也要对我的人民负责
You may have a duty to God, but I have a duty to my people.

486
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,880
我的人都快饿死了
And my people are starving.

487
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:19,780
我要赶紧把粮食运回城去
Right now, I'm going to take the food back to the city.

488
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:22,980
你镇静些 跟我回奥尔良吧
And if you can please calm down and let me accompany you to Orleans...

489
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:25,940
很荣幸欢迎你
it will be my honor to welcome you.

490
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:27,150
主啊
Jesus Christ.

491
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,150
该死的英国佬要付出代价的
The goddamn English will pay for this.

492
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:34,200
是的 他们会遭报应的 可你要再说脏话 你也会的
Yes, they will, and so will you if you don't stop swearing.

493
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,270
进来 欢迎到我的小店来
Come on. I'm happy to welcome you in my tavern.

494
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:57,020
快进来
Come on in.

495
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:02,270
拉希尔 吉尔斯 你们过来看看
La Hire, Gilles, let me show you something.

496
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:14,370
这里是托勒利斯城堡 河从这里穿过
Tourelles are around here. The river crosses there.

497
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:21,300
冷静下 你不能怪这些人
Calm down. You can't blame those people.

498
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:22,840
他们几周前就听说你的事了
They've been hearing about you for weeks.

499
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:26,110
没什么好听的! 知道为什么吗?
There's nothing to hear! And why is there nothing to hear?

500
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,710
因为我还什么都没做 这又是为什么?
Because I haven't done anything! And why haven't I?

501
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,060
因为你们没人听我说!
'Cause none of you will listen to me!

502
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:39,340
你何不过来一起讨论?
Why don't you join us?

503
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:42,510
我们正在分析军情
We're about to discuss the campaign.

504
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:45,130
对不起
I'm sorry.

505
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:47,460
从这里开始 塔尔博特在这些堡垒间
So from here, Talbot has spread his forces...

506
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:49,630
都布置了他的部队
between these forts up here.

507
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:52,170
据我们侦查 过去几天里...
But in the last few days it seems, according to our scouts...

508
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:54,870
在这个堡垒处聚集了一些部队
that some troops have been deployed to this fort here.

509
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,740
这个大家伙是什么?
What about this huge pile down here?

510
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:58,810
那就是托勒利斯城堡 英国人准备以它为基地开展进攻
That's the Tourelles. The English were planning...

511
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:01,980
于是我们就把桥拆了
to launch an attack from it, but then we broke down the bridge...

512
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:04,850
 是我干的  是的
 I did.  Yeah.

513
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:06,850
这样一来他们会安静一阵子
Which should keep them quiet for a while.

514
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:09,850
我的预感是...
Now, my hunch is...

515
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:12,420
他们会从圣鲁普发动进攻
the attack will come from St. Loup, here.

516
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:15,760
贞德 你有什么看法呢?
And what does Jeanne think?

517
00:58:15,770 --> 00:58:19,530
我没有看法 那是上帝的事情
I don't think. I leave that to God.

518
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:22,700
我不管这些 我只负责传达音讯
I am nothing in all of this. I'm just the messenger.

519
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:24,330
那么...
So...

520
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:26,330
音讯是什么呢?
what is the message?

521
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:29,870
我们给英国人...
We give the English...

522
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:32,470
最后一次机会让他们和平撤军
a last chance to go home in peace.

523
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,040
如果他们拒绝呢?
And if they refuse?

524
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:36,650
如果他们拒绝...
If they refuse...

525
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:41,090
我们就渡过河...
we recross the river...

526
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:44,050
攻击这里...
and attack here...

527
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:46,470
攻击托勒利斯
at the Tourelles.

528
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:50,590
这根本行不通 托勒利斯是坚不可摧的
That makes no sense at all. The Tourelles is virtually impregnable.

529
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,890
就算我们在河对岸攻击托勒利斯...
If we are on the other side of the river attacking the Tourelles...

530
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:57,430
可万一塔尔博特从北方攻城 那怎么办?
what's to stop Talbot attacking the city from the north?

531
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:01,130
 有上帝在  上帝 对噢
 God.  God. Why, of course.

532
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:05,750
我们把他给忘了
We'd forgotten about Him.

533
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:12,310
我真为你们感到悲哀 你们现在可以笑...
I feel a great sorrow for you because you are laughing now...

534
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,820
可明天晚上 你们中就会有人死去的
but by tomorrow night, some of you will be dead.

535
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:17,950
说实话 我们不能就那样攻击塔楼
With respect, we can't just attack the Tourelles like that.

536
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:21,520
 那是很复杂的事情  那有什么好复杂的?
 It's a very complicated matter.  What's so complicated about it?

537
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:26,060
我怎么说 你们就怎么做 还有比这更简单的事情吗?
All you have to do is what you're told. What could be simpler than that?

538
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:28,400
我就是一面鼓...
I am the drum...

539
00:59:28,410 --> 00:59:30,400
上帝靠击鼓来传递他的信息
on which God is beating out His message.

540
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:33,500
他是如此的用力! 我的耳朵都要震聋了!
He's beating it so hard, it's bursting my ears!

541
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:36,070
你要明白 我们也很难做
You have to understand, it's not easy for us.

542
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:40,460
我们突然之间要听命于...
I mean, for our pride to suddenly be usurped by...

543
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:48,110
听命于一个...
Well, with all due respect, by a...

544
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:50,930
一个小女孩
by a girl.

545
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:57,590
我明白了
So that's it.

546
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:03,140
对你来说 我只是个小女孩
To you, I'm just a girl.

547
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:08,100
你站在我的立场上想想 如果你是我 你会怎么做?
Put yourself in my shoes for a moment. How would you feel if you were me?

548
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:11,270
我能理解...
Knowing what I know...

549
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:15,160
感激不尽
enormous gratitude.

550
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:21,660
这姑娘很倔吧
One hell of a girl, huh?

551
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:29,240
我警告过你的
I warned you.

552
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:36,330
我超喜欢她气得冒烟的样子
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked.

553
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:39,150
我也是
Me too.

554
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:43,310
大家好 朋友们!
Hello, my friends!

555
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:45,010
这一路可真不容易啊
What a journey.

556
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:47,960
可我们还是来了
But we made it.

557
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:51,300
能重聚在一起 我们好好热闹热闹
Back together again. Let's have some fun.

558
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:58,690
好啊 我会看起来像个男人的
Fine. I shall look like a man.

559
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:05,940
住手!
Stop it!

560
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:09,100
你竟敢阻止我执行上帝的意愿!
How dare you stop me from doing God's will!

561
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:11,240
他也没让你把头发全剪掉啊!
He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off!

562
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,610
你又不知道上帝跟我说什么!
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!

563
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:16,650
不管怎样 既然他不下来亲自剪
Whatever! But since He's not going to come down and cut it Himself...

564
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:18,620
那至少让其他人帮你剪得合适点!
At least let someone cut it properly!

565
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:22,680
雷蒙德 把剪刀拿来
Raymond, bring the scissors.

566
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:26,160
路易斯 把镜子拿来
Louis, fetch the mirror.

567
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:31,650
别在生气了 冷静些
Stop getting so angry about everything. Calm down.

568
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:35,320
我很冷静 是上帝在愤怒
I am calm! It's God that's angry.

569
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:38,020
我现在要写封信
I need to send a letter, now.

570
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:40,480
好的
Fine.

571
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:43,540

停止任何破坏举动
do not bring about your own destruction.

578

向我投降吧 贞德 上帝派来的使者"
Surrender to me,Jeanne the maiden, who was sent here by God."

589
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,690
他们说什么?
What did they say?

590
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:54,220
他们说会考虑考虑
They said they'll think about it.

591

很好
Good.

592
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,200
可说实话 我觉得他们明天不会撤走的
To be honest, I don't think they'll leave tomorrow.

593
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:06,660
我等不到明天了
I can't wait for tomorrow.

594
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:36,320
法兰西正在流血

怎么回事? 谁下令进攻的?
What happened? Who gave the order to attack?

603
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:38,710
谁知道 这主意真是糟透了
God knows. It was a bad idea.

604
01:04:38,770 --> 01:04:40,670
士兵有没有做忏悔? 我们的牧师呢?
Were the men confessed? Where are the priests?

605
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:43,870
没带牧师 我们想要发动突袭
We didn't take them. We wanted to make a surprise attack.

606
01:04:43,950 --> 01:04:46,280
迪努瓦 是你下令进攻的?
Dunois, was it you who gave the order to attack?

607

 回答我!  我们能否以后再谈?
 Answer me!  Can we discuss this later?

608

宜早不宜迟
Sooner is better than later.

609
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,550
等等!
Wait!

610
01:04:56,830 --> 01:04:58,790

到吊桥那儿去!
To the drawbridge!

616
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,950
 她要干什么?  都到吊桥那儿去!

617
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:58,420
 吊桥已经收起来了  一会儿就开了
 The drawbridge is closed.  Not for long.

618
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:08,260

Let's go!

619
01:07:38,890 --> 01:07:40,480
这家伙是我的了
That's mine.

620
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:54,230
真是个大胜仗 是属于你的胜仗
It's a great victory...your victory...

621
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:56,000
我们一定要坚持到底 把英国军都赶回...
but we must follow it through and pursue the English...

622
01:07:56,070 --> 01:07:59,060
塔尔博特的大本营去 你有什么好想法
back to Talbot's camp unless, of course, you have another good idea.

623
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:02,940
首先我们调来主力
First, we find the biggest army we can.

624
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:05,110
 然后打回奥尔良  可是桥已经拆了啊
 Then we return to Orleans.  The bridge has been pulled down.

625
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:08,710
 英国人正在修呢  你怎么知道的?
 The English are rebuilding it.  And how do you know?

626
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:13,050
你有你的军师 我有我的
You have been with your counsel, and I have been with mine.

627
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,300
快点! 快!
Come on! Hurry up!

628
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:50,750
小心伺候我的宝贝
Be careful with my baby.

629
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:24,690
 那就是塔楼了  真是不赖
 That's the Tourelles.  Wonderful.

630
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,350
队长!
Captain!

631
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:35,400
看来是那个法国小娘们带人来了
Looks like the froggy whore's coming to pay us a visit.

632
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:37,060
我去告诉格拉斯代尔
I'd better tell Glasdale.

633
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:43,980
把马都拴在那边
Let's put the horses over there.

634
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:52,580
神父们 请为他们祈祷
Fathers, please, bless them.

635
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:55,150
 请为他们祈祷  好的
 Please, bless them all.  We will.

636
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:13,400
不能再像早上那样了 我们要计划的再周密些
Let's plan this attack a little more carefully than this morning.

637
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:15,070
说的对
Good idea.

638
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,110
大人
Sire.

639
01:10:22,950 --> 01:10:25,850
有客人来访
We've got, uh, visitors.

640
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:47,110
格拉斯代尔!
Glasdale!

641
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:51,570
你听见了吗?
Do you hear me?

642
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:53,910
你可以咒骂我...
You, who call me a whore...

643
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:57,650
而我为你的灵魂感到悲哀...
I feel pity for you, for your soul...

644
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:00,310
为你手下士兵的灵魂感到悲哀!
and for the souls of your men!

645
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:04,490
投降吧! 向上帝投降吧!
Yield! Yield now to the King of Heaven!

646
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:07,500
回到你们的岛国去!
Or go back to your island!

647
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:11,120
你还是回到你的猪圈去吧!
And you, go back to your pigsty!

648
01:11:17,970 --> 01:11:19,570
在城墙布防
Man the walls.

649
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,560
今天早上...
This morning...

650
01:11:43,630 --> 01:11:45,860
上帝赐予了我们一场胜利
God gave us a great victory.

651
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:53,270
可那根本无法跟接下来的胜利相比拟
But it is nothing compared to what He is ready to give us now.

652
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:57,280
我知道你们已疲惫不堪
I know you are all tired and hungry...

653
01:11:57,350 --> 01:12:00,010
可我向你们发誓...
but I swear to you...

654
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:04,710
即使那些英国人长着三头六臂...
that even if these English were hanging from the clouds by their fingertips...

655
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:07,310
我们也一定会在天黑前打得他们落花流水
we would pull them down before nightfall.

656
01:12:09,220 --> 01:12:10,710
现在...
Now...

657
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:13,460
所有爱我的人...

模样是不错
You're beautiful.

668
01:13:35,710 --> 01:13:37,650
现在该看看你威力如何了
Let's see if you're powerful.

669
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:56,290
 别傻愣着!  那做什么?
 Do something!  Like what?

670
01:13:56,370 --> 01:13:58,160
我不管! 别呆着不动!
I don't care! Do something!

671
01:13:58,230 --> 01:14:00,720
发射!
And fire!

672
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:11,240
发射!
Fire!

673
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,120
搞什么?
What the fuck?

674
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:18,950
太高了 装弹!
Too high. Reload!

675
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:36,660
 快离开这里!  他们在哪儿?
 Get out of here!  Where are the men?

676
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:39,830
在这你会死的! 快离开!
You're gonna get killed! Get out of here!

677
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,010
来啊 打啊!

678
01:14:53,690 --> 01:14:55,180
发射! 打啊!
Go! Come on, fight!

679
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:03,800
快搬炮来!
Bring the culverin!

680
01:15:08,870 --> 01:15:10,570
闪开!
Get out!

681
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:17,740
我要到前面去!
I'm going up the side!

682
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:30,180
 贞德!  别管我!

683
01:15:32,430 --> 01:15:34,550
快啊! 冲啊! 冲啊!
Hurry! Come on! Come on!

684
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:26,880
好极了!
Yes!

685
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:30,820
让你抢先把她杀了! 将军!
Hey, you just killed my woman! Captain!

686
01:16:33,090 --> 01:16:34,680
见鬼去吧
Go to hell.

687
01:16:38,730 --> 01:16:41,360
快叫医生来! 医生!
Call the physician! The physician!

688
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,020
他妈的!
Damn it!

689
01:16:44,730 --> 01:16:46,100
路易斯 快叫医生来
Louis, find the physician.

690
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:49,430
得把箭拔出来
We have to take out the arrow.

691
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:51,440
那她会失血过多而死的
She'll bleed to death.

692
01:16:51,510 --> 01:16:54,100
老天 一定得救救她
There must be something we can do for her, for Christ's sakes.

693
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:57,770
 好啊 你去祈祷吧  说的对
 Yes. You can pray.  Good idea.

694
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:04,250
我发誓我这辈子再也不说脏话了
I swear that I will never swear again in my life...

695
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,410
只要你能救她的命
if You save her life.

696
01:17:06,490 --> 01:17:08,750
可我警告你 如果你没救活她...
But I'm warning You, if You let her die...

697
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:10,350
那你就是天下最...
then You're the biggest...

698
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:18,020
 不要说脏话  还真灵啊
 Don't swear.  He heard me.

699
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,630
你们...
Why...

700
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:24,640
你们为什么不去战斗?
Why aren't you fighting?

701
01:17:24,710 --> 01:17:26,470
你受了重伤
You've been badly wounded.

702
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:29,770
 没关系的...没  是中了箭
 It's nothing. It's... It's an arrow.

703
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:32,210
伤得很深
And it's in deep.

704
01:17:38,490 --> 01:17:40,510
医生来之前你要挺住
You must stay still till the physician arrives.

705
01:17:40,590 --> 01:17:44,360
医生来了也是浪费时间 我们还是试试这个符咒吧
Physicians are a waste of time. We'll have more luck with this charm.

706
01:17:44,430 --> 01:17:46,720
阿金库尔战役时 就是它救了我
It saved my life at Agincourt.

707
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:49,560
我宁死也不靠这种魔咒
I'd rather die than use magic.

708
01:17:49,630 --> 01:17:52,160
如果再不拔出箭 你就死定了
You will die if that arrow stays in you much longer.

709
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:19,590
这下好了 讨厌的东西没了
Well, at least this won't bother us anymore.

710
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:25,160
我们去战场吧!
Now, let's go to the battle!

711
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,570
拜托!
Please!

712
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:36,100
她还真是够疯狂的
She's nuts.

713
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:38,740
你冷静点 你必须休息
You must stay calm. You must rest.

714
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:41,040
好 我休息
I'll rest.

715
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:43,240
可你们都要...
But you have to...

716
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:45,220
答应我
promise me...

717
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:49,550
你们都返回战场上去
that you'll...that you'll go back to the battle.

718
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:52,090
我答应你
I promise.

719
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:03,640
快点!
Hurry!

720
01:19:03,710 --> 01:19:05,300
快! 救救她!
Quickly! Do something!

721
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:18,980
她睡着了
She's sleeping.

722
01:19:19,050 --> 01:19:20,650
什么?
What?

723
01:19:31,470 --> 01:19:34,230
回来啊! 干吗跑啊?
Come on back! Why are you running away?

724
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:39,270
 贞德还活着  很好
 Jeanne is alive.  Good.

725
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:42,870
 我们要加强进攻  撤退
 We have to press on the attack.  Sound the retreat.

726
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:45,470
 我答应了贞德要继续战斗的  我可没这么说
 I promised Jeanne we'd fight on.  I made no such promise.

727
01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:48,980
 晚上撤退  不 她不是这么下的命令
 Sound the retreat for the night.  No, that was her order.

728
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:52,080
我已经受够她的命令了!
I'm fed up with taking her orders!

729
01:19:52,150 --> 01:19:54,920
她还说过会在天黑前打败英军!
She swore she'd defeat the English before nightfall!

730
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:59,190
可她却去瞎逞英雄 还差点死了!
Instead, she goes and plays the fool, gets herself nearly killed!

731
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:02,200
你看! 看看我们现在的处境!
Look! Look at the mess we're in!

732
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:04,320
这都是她的错! 不是我的错!
That's her mess, not mine!

733
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,460
如果没有她 我们的情况不会这么糟
We are worse off than if she'd never come at all.

734
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:11,230
现在都听我的! 撤退!
Now do as I say and sound the retreat!

735
01:20:18,950 --> 01:20:21,850
你们去哪儿啊? 回来啊!
Where are you going? Hey, come back!

736
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:24,320
回来接着打啊!
Come back and fight!

737
01:20:44,410 --> 01:20:47,380
 你在做什么?  给英国佬写信
 What are you making?  A message for the English.

738
01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:55,480
士兵们怎么说?
So, what are the men saying?

739
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:58,280
她是上帝的恩赐
She's a gift from God.

740
01:20:58,350 --> 01:21:01,450
甚至有些人称她是圣人
Some even call her a saint.

741
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:05,250
 就算去地狱 我也愿意陪着她  她叫你去 你真的去吗?
 I'd gladly follow her through hell.  Will you go that far if she asks you?

742
01:21:05,330 --> 01:21:08,560
当然会去 又不是没去过
Of course I will, and I've been there before.

743
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,540
有件事情我闹不明白
There's one thing I don't quite understand.

744
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,940
既然她是上帝派来的
She's been sent to us by God.

745
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:21,680
上帝怎会能让她受这么重的伤呢?
Why does He allow her to be wounded so badly?

746
01:21:21,740 --> 01:21:26,180
那还不如问 她究竟是不是上帝派来的?
Maybe the good question is, is she really sent by God?

747
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:31,480
这谁会知道?
Who knows?

748
01:21:31,550 --> 01:21:34,040
上帝知道
God knows.

749
01:22:32,850 --> 01:22:36,150
这女人还有把剑
Ooh. A woman with a sword.

750
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:45,660
你弄坏了大爷的心情
You've hurt my feelings.

751
01:23:42,980 --> 01:23:44,820
法国佬们!
Frenchies!

752
01:23:44,890 --> 01:23:47,550
你们的宝贝天使怎么了?
What happened to your precious angel?

753
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:51,650
啊? 法国佬们! 法国佬们!
Huh? Frenchies! Frenchies!

754
01:23:51,730 --> 01:23:54,820
我告诉你们吧!
I'll tell you what happened!

755
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:58,560
我们把那个小娘们送回地狱去了...
We sent the little bitch back to hell...

756
01:23:58,630 --> 01:24:03,090
这样她就能找魔鬼寻欢了!
so she can go fuck with the devil!

757
01:24:05,310 --> 01:24:09,040
你们现在打算如何啊? 法国佬们
What are you gonna do now, Frenchies?

758
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:12,880
出来打一仗如何啊? 来啊!
Why not come out and fight? Come on!

759
01:24:12,950 --> 01:24:17,180
来啊! 浑小子们! 醒醒吧!
Come on! Bastards, wake up!

760
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:19,980
是不是正忙着祷告呢
Or are you too busy praying...

761
01:24:20,050 --> 01:24:24,420
以为那样做 那小娘们就能复活了?
to bring your little fucking witch back from the dead?

762
01:24:25,830 --> 01:24:27,760
听见了吗?
Do you hear me?

763
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:31,790
我听见了!
I hear you!

764
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:38,470
我还活着!
I'm alive!

765
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:45,110
或许上帝能宽恕你的亵渎...
May God forgive your blasphemy...

766
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:50,120
可我决不原谅
for I never will.

767
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:55,850
决不原谅!
I never will!

768
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:08,270
你在干什么? 你需要休息
What are you doing? You need to rest.

769
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:10,930
必须把战士们都叫醒!
We must wake up the soldiers, now!

770
01:25:11,010 --> 01:25:13,530
好战士们 醒醒!
My fine soldiers, wake up!

771
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:18,440
准备战斗! 准备战斗!
To arms! To arms!

772
01:25:18,510 --> 01:25:22,470
醒醒! 醒醒! 准备开战了!
Wake up! Wake up! We must fight the battle!

773
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:29,490
战士们! 战斗就要开始了
My fine soldiers, the battle has begun!

774
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:37,530
醒醒! 时机已经来到了!
Wake up! The time has come!

775
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:43,600
战斗就要开始了!
The battle has begun!

776
01:25:43,670 --> 01:25:46,140
 准备战斗!  什么?
 To arms!  Yes?

777
01:25:46,210 --> 01:25:50,670
士兵们 把这座塔拉起来! 现在!
My soldiers, we need this tower up! We need this tower up, now!

778
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:59,310
用力拉啊!
Pull!

779
01:26:03,730 --> 01:26:07,320
 这是干什么?  我们把塔还会去
 What's going on?  We're taking back the Tourelles.

780
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:17,740
全体准备!
Get ready!

781
01:26:26,650 --> 01:26:29,210
去叫醒格拉斯代尔
Go wake up Glasdale.

782
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:48,370
 你这是干什么?  给格拉斯代尔送个信儿
 What are you doing?  Sending a message to Glasdale.

783
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:51,060
 就用它?  是的
 With that?  Yes.

784
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:53,660
可你把它的背面冲向前面了
But you've got it back to front.

785
01:26:53,740 --> 01:26:55,680
听着 我知道自己在做什么
Listen, I know what I'm doing...

786
01:26:55,740 --> 01:27:00,240
要么过来帮把手 要么就回去睡你的觉去
so either lend a hand or get back to bed.

787
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:03,580
我也要给格莱斯代尔送个信儿了
I'm going to send a message to Glasdale too.

788
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:09,590
大人?
My lord?

789
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:12,180
何事?
What?

790
01:27:13,830 --> 01:27:17,420
那个法国女人又活过来了
The French witch, she's back from the dead.

791
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:19,430
快点 士兵们!
Hurry up, men!

792
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:24,230
我们还是再仔细考虑考虑吧
Don't you think we should take some time to think about this?

793
01:27:24,310 --> 01:27:26,240
宜早不宜迟
Sooner is better than later.

794
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:35,770
准备战斗! 准备战斗!
To arms! To arms!

795
01:27:35,850 --> 01:27:37,440
早上好
Good morning.

796
01:27:43,190 --> 01:27:44,780
用这个
This one.

797
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:50,330
她到底耍的什么把戏?
What the fuck is she playing at?

798
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:54,100
我不知道! 问题是她现在在干啥?
I don't know! The question is, what is she doing now?

799
01:27:54,170 --> 01:27:57,230
她什么都不跟我们商量 我们怎么做事?
How can we plan anything if she doesn't consult with us?

800
01:27:57,310 --> 01:27:59,800
 我们昨天跟她商量了吗?  少提这茬
 Did we consult with her yesterday?  Don't even start.

801
01:27:59,870 --> 01:28:02,570
 你昨天也是同意进攻的  是啊 可那不算
 You agreed to attack yesterday too.  Yes, but that doesn't count.

802
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:05,510
 为啥?  因为我一辈子都同意进攻
 Why is that?  Because I always agree to attack.

803
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:06,740
准备战斗!
To arms!

804
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:16,620
疯婆子
Crazy bitch.

805
01:28:16,690 --> 01:28:18,630
她连怎么用都不知道
She doesn't even know how to use it.

806
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:32,700
天哪!
Oh, my God!

807
01:28:41,420 --> 01:28:44,650
 靠! 快关城门!  关城门!
 Fuck! Close the doors!  Close the doors!

808
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:59,330
 开门啊!  给"箭猪"装箭!
 Open the door!  Load the porcupine!

809
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:09,510
用力拉!
Pull!

810
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:26,750
拉!
And pull!

811
01:29:29,930 --> 01:29:32,060
快! 动作快点!
Come on! Hurry up!

812
01:29:45,010 --> 01:29:46,380
来吧!
Come on!

813
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,060
不要企盼奇迹 待在这儿
Never wait for miracles. Stay there.

814
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:11,400
法国娘们! 来抓我啊!
French whore! Come and get me!

815
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:15,700
还等什么呢?
What are you waiting for?

816
01:30:18,550 --> 01:30:21,450
什么事? 贞德!
Yes? Oh,Jeanne!

817
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:25,410
准备火箭手! 烧城门!
Find your archers and burn that door!

818
01:30:25,490 --> 01:30:26,980
马上办!
Right away!

819
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:32,620
推!
Push!

820
01:30:40,870 --> 01:30:43,930
城门准备!
Prepare the gate! Come on!

821
01:30:44,010 --> 01:30:46,100
弓箭手就位!
Position!

822
01:30:48,710 --> 01:30:50,300
放!
Fire!

823
01:30:56,450 --> 01:30:57,680
拿水来!
Water!

824
01:30:57,750 --> 01:30:59,240
放!
Fire!

825
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:07,850
上帝啊!
Oh, my God!

826
01:31:14,770 --> 01:31:16,360
杀了她
Kill her.

827
01:31:18,810 --> 01:31:21,600
他妈的 装箭!
Fuck. Reload!

828
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:22,700
再来些弓箭手!
More archers!

829
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:52,030
漂亮
Perfect.

830
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:56,700
再来些弓箭手!
More archers!

831
01:31:56,780 --> 01:31:58,070
帮帮我!
Help me!

832
01:32:09,490 --> 01:32:12,390
集合你的人! 准备攻城车!
Get your men! We'll load this up as a battering ram!

833
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:14,330
早做好了
Already done.

834
01:32:47,330 --> 01:32:49,350
 怎么了?  没事
 What?  Nothing.

835
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:57,090
那帮我抬这些人
Help me with these men, please.

836
01:32:57,170 --> 01:32:58,760
是的
Yes.

837
01:33:00,610 --> 01:33:02,200
遵命
As you command.

838
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:16,260
等等 你要干什么?
Wait. What are you doing?

839
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:20,090
撞开城门 你不是这么想的吗?
We're going to open that door. Isn't that what you want?

840
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:25,130
快给我让开!
Get out of my fucking way!

841
01:33:30,370 --> 01:33:31,960
把锅加满!
Fill the cauldron!

842
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:37,280
该死的法国人! 看我怎么收拾你们
Fucking French! What the fuck do you know about me?

843
01:33:44,390 --> 01:33:45,910
装箭 装箭!
Reload. Reload!

844
01:33:52,490 --> 01:33:55,930
快把锅倒满! 你们等什么呢?
Fill the fucking cauldron! What are you waiting for?

845
01:34:00,370 --> 01:34:02,800
来人! 来人!
More men! More men!

846
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:16,710
预备!
Ready!

847
01:34:41,410 --> 01:34:44,310
倒油! 倒油!
Pour the oil! Pour the oil!

848
01:35:38,430 --> 01:35:41,490
你在干什么? 贞德
What are you doing,Jeanne?

849
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:44,800
我在玩
I'm playing.

850
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:07,200
你对我做了些什么? 贞德
What are you doing to me,Jeanne?

851
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:26,050
听见我说了吗?
Do you hear me?

852
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:28,460
你怎么了?
Are you all right?

853
01:36:28,530 --> 01:36:31,090
能听见我说话吗? 冷静一下
Do you hear me? Calm down.

854
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:33,430
结束了
It's over.

855
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:35,060
我们赢了
We won.

856
01:36:35,130 --> 01:36:37,100
 赢了?  是的
 We won?  Yes.

857
01:36:44,540 --> 01:36:46,910
臭婆娘
Fucking bitch.

858
01:36:50,050 --> 01:36:53,480
我的朋友! 我的战友! 快过来
My friend! My soldier! In my arms.

859
01:36:56,290 --> 01:36:58,650
 我们赢了?  赢?
 We won?  Won?

860
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:02,250
错了 贞德 怎么能用这个小词呢
No. No,Jeanne. So small a word will never do.

861
01:37:02,330 --> 01:37:05,630
这是胜利!
This is victory!

862
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:08,490
这是荣誉!
This is glory!

863
01:37:35,390 --> 01:37:37,260
你怎么了?
What's the matter?

864
01:37:41,270 --> 01:37:43,200
这就是荣誉?
This is glory?

865
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,940
不要紧的
Doesn't matter.

866
01:37:55,810 --> 01:37:57,870
这不可能
This is not possible.

867
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:13,550
这不可能
It is not possible.

868
01:38:13,630 --> 01:38:17,400
你看起来很失望啊 这不是你想要的?
You look disappointed. Isn't this what you wanted?

869
01:38:17,470 --> 01:38:21,130
不 不该是这样的
No. Not like this.

870
01:38:21,210 --> 01:38:24,140
几周来你一直渴望着这一切
For weeks you've been asking for this.

871
01:38:24,210 --> 01:38:27,140
现在你得到了
Well, now you have it.

872
01:38:35,490 --> 01:38:37,180
 你要干什么?  没什么
 What are you doing?  Nothing.

873
01:38:37,250 --> 01:38:39,450
我只是想要他的牙
I'm just taking his teeth.

874
01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:44,360
你不能为了想要一个人的牙就杀了他
But you just can't kill a man for his teeth.

875
01:38:44,430 --> 01:38:46,420
为什么不? 他的牙很不赖
Why not? He has good teeth.

876
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:50,660
你...你不能这么做!
Because...Because you can't!

877
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:54,060
那这一切又是什么?
What about all this?

878
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:56,770
那不一样
But that's different.

879
01:38:56,840 --> 01:39:00,540
我们战斗是为了我们的理想
I mean, we were fighting for a cause.

880
01:39:00,610 --> 01:39:03,980
我不是 他是我的俘虏
Not me. He's my prisoner...

881
01:39:04,050 --> 01:39:05,740
要不要他的牙是我的事
I can take his teeth if I want to.

882
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:09,380
你不能这样! 住手!
No, you can't! Stop it!

883
01:39:09,450 --> 01:39:10,890
给 拿着!
Here. Take this!

884
01:39:12,020 --> 01:39:14,990
现在他是我的了 而你
He's mine now. Here, you.

885
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:17,190
走吧
Go.

886
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:22,020
做的好啊 那其他战俘怎么办?
Bravo. And what about all the other prisoners?

887
01:39:22,100 --> 01:39:25,070
 全放他们走?  我不知道
 Do we let them go too?  I don't know.

888
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:28,530
也许吧
Maybe.

889
01:39:36,510 --> 01:39:40,450
我们必须去忏悔 我们必须去忏悔
We must confess. We must confess.

890
01:39:42,450 --> 01:39:45,350
我们要做忏悔 所有人都做
Please, we have to be confessed. All of us.

891
01:39:50,490 --> 01:39:53,520
我知道这不符合一般习惯...
I know this is not normal custom...

892
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:55,430
可是
but, uh...

893
01:39:59,470 --> 01:40:02,700
一切会好起来的 他会听我们忏悔的
Everything's gonna be fine. He's gonna confess us.

894
01:40:05,610 --> 01:40:07,910
跪下 都跪下
Kneel. Kneel.

895
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:21,350
阿朗松带来个坏消息
Alencon brings bad news.

896
01:40:21,430 --> 01:40:25,490
上千名英军正在河岸远处集结
Thousands of English are forming up on the far side of the river.

897
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:28,000
我们要清点一下人数 准备作战了
I think we should count our men and get ready.

898
01:40:29,170 --> 01:40:30,290
我们走
Let's go.

899
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:11,830
我过去
I'll go.

900
01:41:14,780 --> 01:41:17,010
一个人过去
Alone.

901
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:48,080
告诉你们的国王 亨利!
I have a message for your King Henry!

902
01:41:49,250 --> 01:41:51,840
这是上帝给他的音讯!
It is a message from God!

903
01:41:52,750 --> 01:41:54,340
回家吧!
Go home!

904
01:41:57,220 --> 01:42:00,050
静静地回去吧!
Go now, in peace!

905
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:04,760
你们不走的话 这里就将是你们的葬身之地!
If you do not go now, you will be buried in this field!

906
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:12,600
我已经看够了鲜血!
I've seen enough blood!

907
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:15,840
可如果你们还想看...
But if you want more...

908
01:42:17,370 --> 01:42:19,000
那我也无法阻拦你们!
I can't stop you!

909
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:24,580
我要说的是 看到的只会是你们的鲜血...
I can only warn you that it will be your blood...

910
01:42:25,950 --> 01:42:27,140
不会是我们的!
not ours!

911
01:42:28,950 --> 01:42:32,550
我等你们的答复
I'm waiting for your answer.

912
01:42:47,870 --> 01:42:51,570
不要期待奇迹 准备战斗
Never wait for miracles. Stand by to attack.

913
01:43:04,450 --> 01:43:06,290
求你了
Please.

914
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:15,130
主啊...
My Lord...

915
01:43:16,530 --> 01:43:17,830
求你了
please.

916
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:52,470
那就是他妈所谓的奇迹了
Now that's what I call a goddamn bloody miracle.

917
01:43:52,540 --> 01:43:54,730
她跨着白色战马 孤身前往...
She was on her white horse alone...

918
01:43:54,810 --> 01:43:57,240
面对全部英军 逼退了他们...
facing the whole English army, and she drove them away...

919
01:43:57,310 --> 01:44:00,240
现在奥尔良自由了
and now Orleans is free.

920
01:44:10,790 --> 01:44:12,310
我们失去了奥尔良
We lost Orleans.

921
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,550
我要抓住那个女孩
I want that girl.

922
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:22,060
我要烧死她
I want that girl burned.

923
01:44:42,150 --> 01:44:45,380
我能见见裁缝吗? 太紧了 我喘不过气了
May I see the seamstress? It's too tight. I can't breathe.

924
01:44:45,460 --> 01:44:48,980
那也算是皇冠? 没有更好点的吗?
That's meant to be a crown? Don't you have something more regal?

925
01:44:49,060 --> 01:44:51,080
英国人把真的拿走了
The English took the real one.

926
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:54,720
浑身脏的时间太长了 我都忘了干净是什么样了
It's been muddy so long I forgot how good it looked cleaned up.

927
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:57,730
你里面也弄干净了吗?
But did you remember to clean up what's inside as well?

928
01:44:57,800 --> 01:45:00,930
我要的是个宏大的加冕礼 你这算什么?
I ask for a grandiose coronation, and this is what you give?

929
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,770
真是彻底的失败啊!
This whole thing is going to be an utter fiasco!

930
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:07,470
你只给我三天时间准备 你父亲的加冕准备了三个月
You gave me 3 days to prepare. Your father's coronation took 3 months.

931
01:45:07,540 --> 01:45:09,310
说的对 看来我们应该推迟了
He's right. We should call for a delay.

932
01:45:09,380 --> 01:45:11,750
没时间了 我们不能停下来
No time. We can't hold up the ceremony.

933
01:45:11,820 --> 01:45:13,210
谁知道英国人什么时候还会回来
No telling when the English might come back.

934
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:16,580
回来好啊 让他们瞧瞧法国真正的国王
Let them come. Let them see who is the true king of France.

935
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:29,930
该死的英国人 我们本该在巴黎圣母院举行仪式的
Those damn English. We should be doing this in Paris in Notre Dame.

936
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,160
那会比这个隆重两倍
It is much more prestigious and twice as big.

937
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:35,430
大小不重要 神圣才是关键 对吧主教?
It is the sacred place that matters, not the size. Correct, Bishop?

938
01:45:35,510 --> 01:45:39,410
是的夫人 法国的国王必须...
Yes, my lady. True kings of France must be anointed...

939
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:42,210
在伟大的兰斯大教堂施以涂油礼
in our great cathedral of Reims with the holy oil of Clovis.

940
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:56,490
阁下! 好像没有油了
Your Grace! There can be no anointing.

941
01:45:56,560 --> 01:46:00,660
 你说什么呢?  施礼用的油不见了
 What are you talking about?  The holy oil of Clovis is all gone.

942
01:46:00,730 --> 01:46:02,130
不见了? 不可能
Gone? That's impossible.

943
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:06,000
那可是神油 是不会用尽的
It's a magic oil. A miraculous oil. It can never be exhausted.

944
01:46:06,070 --> 01:46:08,200
 您自己看看  有问题吗?
 Look for yourself.  Problem?

945
01:46:08,270 --> 01:46:10,260
这就奇怪了
I just don't understand.

946
01:46:10,340 --> 01:46:13,430
上次我看的时候 油还满满的
The oil of Clovis. It was quite full the last time I saw it.

947
01:46:13,510 --> 01:46:17,040
 上次是什么时候?  查尔斯六世加冕的时候
 And when was that?  At the coronation of King Charles VI.

948
01:46:17,110 --> 01:46:20,080
三十年前? 那它消失有什么奇怪的?
Thirty years ago? Does it surprise you it's gone?

949
01:46:20,150 --> 01:46:23,050
你不明白
But you don't understand.

950
01:46:23,120 --> 01:46:27,250
那是神油 非比寻常
It's no ordinary oil. It's a miraculous oil.

951
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:30,890
是天堂来的白鸽子送来这里...
It was brought by a white dove from heaven...

952
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:33,830
给国王加冕用的
to crown King Clovis in this very cathedral.

953
01:46:34,900 --> 01:46:38,160
 你干什么?  完成这个奇迹
 What are you doing?  Performing a miracle.

954
01:47:57,980 --> 01:48:02,350
神油在此 万能的主保佑...
With this sacred oil, blessed by the hand of God the Father Almighty...

955
01:48:02,420 --> 01:48:05,250
向你施以涂油礼 查尔斯·瓦罗亚...
we do anoint thee, Charles Valois...

956
01:48:05,320 --> 01:48:10,350
成为法兰西至高无上的国王...
to be sovereign lord and king of this great kingdom of France...

957
01:48:10,430 --> 01:48:14,800
在你的有生之年...
charging that ye should defend the faith of our Mother Holy Church...

958
01:48:14,870 --> 01:48:17,560
维护教会的信仰
as long as ye shall live.

959
01:48:18,640 --> 01:48:19,900
阿门
Amen.

960
01:48:54,670 --> 01:48:56,610
国王万岁!
Long live the king!

961
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:17,890
 贞德 你没事吧?  是 我没事
 Jeanne, are you all right?  Yes, I'm fine.

962
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:24,090
 你盯着我干什么?  你腿上中箭了
 Why are you staring at me?  You have an arrow in your leg.

963
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:31,700
知道了
So there is.

964
01:49:33,140 --> 01:49:35,200
可那不耽误你接着攀墙啊!
But that doesn't stop you from climbing!

965
01:49:36,380 --> 01:49:39,970
快去攀! 快去!
Well, climb! Go! Go!

966
01:49:45,620 --> 01:49:47,180
把这支箭拔出来
Take this arrow out.

967
01:49:52,530 --> 01:49:54,330
留神!
Look out!

968
01:49:55,700 --> 01:49:59,100
 小心点!  贞德 士兵已经疲惫不堪了
 Be careful!  Jeanne, the men are exhausted.

969
01:49:59,170 --> 01:50:01,970
我知道 可敌人正在撤退 巴黎就要是我们的了
I know, but so is the enemy. They're falling back. Paris is ours.

970
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:04,100
贞德 我们人不够了
Jeanne, we are not enough.

971
01:50:04,170 --> 01:50:06,870
那就把援军调过来
So bring up the reinforcements.

972
01:50:06,940 --> 01:50:08,910
援军? 哪儿有?
Reinforcements? Where?

973
01:50:10,110 --> 01:50:12,080
就在我们后面
Right behind us.

974
01:50:12,150 --> 01:50:14,880
迪努瓦带着他的一万人马
Dunois with another 1 0,000 men.

975
01:50:14,950 --> 01:50:18,150
 贞德 你自己回头看看  只看前方 不要回头
 Jeanne, look behind you.  Never look behind. Only ahead.

976
01:50:20,220 --> 01:50:23,090
你知道怎么数数吗?
Do you know how to count?

977
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:29,430
我当然会! 把他们调过来!
Of course I do! So, bring them up!

978
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:36,230
贞德 那可不是一万援军!
Jeanne, that is not 1 0,000 reinforcements!

979
01:50:36,310 --> 01:50:38,370
那只是一百名...
That is 100...

980
01:50:38,440 --> 01:50:41,210
忠心无比但又疲惫不堪的士兵!
very loyal but very tired soldiers!

981
01:50:43,010 --> 01:50:45,540
迪努瓦呢?
But where's Dunois?

982
01:50:45,620 --> 01:50:47,710
国王答应给我的军队呢?
And where are the men the king promised me?

983
01:50:47,780 --> 01:50:51,310
他跟本就没派军队! 你还不明白吗?
He never sent them! Don't you understand?

984
01:50:51,390 --> 01:50:53,550
他不想再打仗了
He doesn't want this war anymore.

985
01:50:53,620 --> 01:50:56,590
他已经得到王冠了 他已经满足了
He has his crown now. That's all he ever wanted.

986
01:50:57,830 --> 01:51:00,890
可是那些声音 他们明明答应我的
But my voices, they promised me.

987
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:03,690
去你的奇怪声音吧!
To hell with your voices!

988
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:09,240
面对现实吧!
It's time to face facts!

989
01:51:11,570 --> 01:51:14,410
我们不该来这儿!
We have nothing to do here!

990
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:16,410
谁都不该来!
None of us!

991
01:51:18,650 --> 01:51:20,580
甚至是你
Not even you.

992
01:51:25,620 --> 01:51:28,090
你们不再相信我了吗?
You don't believe in me anymore?

993
01:51:28,160 --> 01:51:31,180
贞德 我们当然还相信你
Jeanne, of course we still believe in you.

994
01:51:31,260 --> 01:51:35,460
如果我说了算 我要把英国人全赶到海里去
If it were up to me, I'd chase every goddamn Englishman into the ocean.

995
01:51:35,530 --> 01:51:38,190
可我们说了不算
But it's not up to us anymore.

996
01:51:38,270 --> 01:51:40,200
国王说了才算
It's up to the king.

997
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:54,310
我们回去吧 贞德
You should go home,Jeanne.

998
01:52:08,870 --> 01:52:12,800
她要的军队太庞大 我们无法负担
We cannot possibly afford to pay for the size of army she's demanding.

999
01:52:12,870 --> 01:52:14,200
那女孩疯了
Girl is crazy.

1000
01:52:16,410 --> 01:52:18,600
她在奥尔良的胜利是个奇迹
Her victory at Orleans was a miracle.

1001
01:52:18,680 --> 01:52:22,170
可我们建造法国的未来是不能靠奇迹的
But we can't wait for a miracle when we build a future for France.

1002
01:52:24,710 --> 01:52:27,480
巴黎一战是场灾难
Paris was a disaster.

1003
01:52:27,550 --> 01:52:29,540
上帝已经不跟她在一起了
God wasn't with her then.

1004
01:52:29,620 --> 01:52:32,680
如果上帝抛弃了她 我们该怎么办?
If God deserts her, what do you think we should do?

1005
01:52:44,570 --> 01:52:48,500
你为什么出卖我? 再给我几百人巴黎就是我们的了
Why did you betray me? Paris was ours. All I needed was a few hundred men.

1006
01:52:48,570 --> 01:52:53,100
 为什么你不派给我军队?  给你?
 Why did you take the army you gave me?  Gave you?

1007
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:56,580
 我当时的意思可不是这个  那你什么意思?
 I wouldn't quite put it that way.  So how would you put it?

1008
01:53:01,820 --> 01:53:05,080
我们 很感激...
We are, of course, enormously grateful...

1009
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:07,560
你过去所做的贡献
for your past efforts...

1010
01:53:07,620 --> 01:53:10,180
现在你的任务已经完成了
but now your task is done.

1011
01:53:10,260 --> 01:53:12,660
是该进行和谈的时候了
Now is the time for negotiation.

1012
01:53:12,730 --> 01:53:14,960
只有战争才能从英国人那里得到和平
Peace will only be got with the English by the end of a lance.

1013
01:53:15,030 --> 01:53:19,300
你就这么嗜血如命? 你很享受吗?
Why are you so bloodthirsty? Do you enjoy it?

1014
01:53:21,870 --> 01:53:24,640
外交手段要更文明...
Diplomacy is far more civilized...

1015
01:53:24,710 --> 01:53:27,730
更安全 也更廉价
far safer and far cheaper.

1016
01:53:35,550 --> 01:53:40,180
这是受围困的城来的信 那里的百姓都要饿死了...
I've letters here from towns under siege, where your people are starving...

1017
01:53:40,260 --> 01:53:42,950
祈求上帝去帮帮他们
begging God on their knees to help them.

1018
01:53:43,030 --> 01:53:46,890
我要去给他们答复 你去要阻拦我?
I'm here to answer their prayers. And you want to stop me?

1019
01:53:49,130 --> 01:53:52,570
法国不是属于你个人的 查尔斯
France does not belong to you, Charles.

1020
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:54,930
她是属于上帝的
She belongs to God.

1021
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:08,780
她能乖乖回家就好了
If only she would just go home.

1022
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:30,030
那我现在怎么办?
So what am I supposed to do now?

1023
01:54:31,370 --> 01:54:34,740
 你们有得到什么启示吗?  已经好几周听不见他们的声音了
 What do your voices say?  They haven't spoken to me in weeks.

1024
01:54:34,810 --> 01:54:37,010
是从加冕礼以后
Not since the coronation.

1025
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:39,070
没有任何征兆
No signs, nothing.

1026
01:54:40,620 --> 01:54:42,780
或许他们的沉默就是一种指示
Maybe their silence is a sign.

1027
01:54:43,850 --> 01:54:46,520
 就是让你回家去  不是的
 Maybe it's a sign to go home.  No.

1028
01:54:46,590 --> 01:54:49,580
还不是时候 我的使命还没有完成
It's not time yet. My mission isn't over yet.

1029
01:54:50,990 --> 01:54:54,900
 我还有好多要做的事  可你怎么做...
 There's still more I have to do.  But how do...

1030
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:56,960
你怎么知道...
How do you know that these...

1031
01:54:57,030 --> 01:55:00,090
那些声音就是对你说的?
these voices aren't just really you?

1032
01:55:01,540 --> 01:55:05,910
是对我说的 上帝就是这样指示我的
Well, they are me. That's how God speaks to me.

1033
01:55:07,680 --> 01:55:11,240
如果你仔仔细细的听 你也能听见的
Even you could hear them if you listened hard enough.

1034
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:15,010
你说的太容易了
You make it sound so simple.

1035
01:55:16,690 --> 01:55:18,980
连你也不再相信我了
So even you don't believe in me anymore.

1036
01:55:19,060 --> 01:55:23,890
贞德 我比任何人都信任你
Jeanne, I believe in you more than anyone.

1037
01:55:23,960 --> 01:55:27,160
我只是希望...
I just wish I could...

1038
01:55:27,230 --> 01:55:29,820
我能帮帮你
help you.

1039
01:55:29,900 --> 01:55:32,800
想帮我 做一件事就可以了
There is one thing you can do if you want to help me.

1040
01:55:32,870 --> 01:55:34,000
告诉我
Tell me.

1041
01:55:34,070 --> 01:55:36,800
让国王把他许诺的军队给我
Tell the king to give back the army that he gave me.

1042
01:55:47,250 --> 01:55:49,680
我们必须阻止她 陛下
We have to stop her, Your Majesty.

1043
01:55:49,750 --> 01:55:53,020
如果她率领军队 攻打勃艮第...
If she raises an army and attacks the Burgundians...

1044
01:55:53,090 --> 01:55:56,060
那几个月的和谈就白费了
months of negotiations will have been in vain.

1045
01:55:57,490 --> 01:55:59,720
贞德为我们已经做的够多的了
Jeanne has done so much for us.

1046
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:03,290
我自己也是十分敬佩她
I can assure you, the maid has no greater admirer than myself.

1047
01:56:03,370 --> 01:56:06,300
可不论我们个人怎么想 我们也不能...
Whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct...

1048
01:56:06,370 --> 01:56:09,000
让她为了报仇去打仗
her own private war.

1049
01:56:09,070 --> 01:56:13,070
为了国家着想您不能让她去康比涅
For the sake of the kingdom, you must stop her from going to Compiegne.

1050
01:56:13,140 --> 01:56:15,700
我阻止不了她
I can't stop her.

1051
01:56:15,780 --> 01:56:20,880
如果你不原意的话 勃艮第人会原意帮您的
Well, if you don't, I'm sure the Burgundians would be happy to oblige.

1052
01:56:20,950 --> 01:56:23,420
或许他们可以在康比涅抓住她...
If they capture her at Compiegne...

1053
01:56:23,490 --> 01:56:25,750
那就没人会怪罪我们了
No one could blame us.

1054
01:56:27,590 --> 01:56:32,430
可那好像是我们出卖了她
But it could sound like we betrayed her.

1055
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:34,960
 不 没有  上帝啊 不是
 No, never.  Good heavens, no.

1056
01:56:35,030 --> 01:56:37,230
别担心 查尔斯
Don't worry, Charles.

1057
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:43,970
如果上帝仍然与她同在 她会胜利的
If God is still with her, she will be victorious.

1058
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:46,270
可她的军队是那么少
But her army's so much smaller.

1059
01:56:46,340 --> 01:56:49,440
那她的信仰可要更强烈才行
Then her faith will have to be bigger.

1060
01:57:03,830 --> 01:57:07,690
 你干什么? 快开门  我不能拿自己的城冒险
 What are you doing? Open this gate.  I can't risk the safety of my town.

1061
01:57:10,230 --> 01:57:11,830
拿着我的旗!
Take my banner!

1062
01:58:09,460 --> 01:58:10,860
上帝啊
My Lord.

1063
01:58:12,260 --> 01:58:14,090
上帝啊
My Lord.

1064
01:58:39,190 --> 01:58:40,950
真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

1065
01:58:41,020 --> 01:58:45,890
你幻想中的死亡竟是遍地长满了草
Your romantic vision of death with all that grass growing everywhere.

1066
01:58:45,960 --> 01:58:48,620
我必须承认你的想象力是很强
I must admit, you have a big imagination.

1067
01:58:48,700 --> 01:58:51,430
可还是不够
But maybe not big enough.

1068
01:58:51,500 --> 01:58:55,770
死亡其实很简单
Death is much more simple.

1069
01:58:58,980 --> 01:59:02,600
几个月后会变得更有趣些
After a few months, it gets more interesting.

1070
01:59:05,310 --> 01:59:09,080
一年后就会变得...
Then after a year, it finally becomes...

1071
01:59:11,320 --> 01:59:13,150
虚无缥缈
romantic.

1072
01:59:18,030 --> 01:59:19,590
你是谁?
Who are you?

1073
01:59:19,660 --> 01:59:22,500
不喜欢我这张脸?
You don't like my face?

1074
01:59:22,570 --> 01:59:24,900
这张你或许会喜欢
Maybe you'd prefer this one.

1075
01:59:28,370 --> 01:59:30,360
可能太小了
Too young, maybe.

1076
01:59:30,440 --> 01:59:33,100
这一张呢?
How about this one?

1077
01:59:34,780 --> 01:59:39,610
好些了吗? 还没完呢
Better now? But incomplete.

1078
01:59:44,890 --> 01:59:48,190
我识破你了 撒旦
Get thee behind me, Satan.

1079
01:59:48,260 --> 01:59:52,960
你以为你是谁 竟能区分出善恶?
Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil?

1080
01:59:55,060 --> 01:59:56,460
你是上帝吗?
Are you God?

1081
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:03,400
我只是一个信使
I'm just a messenger.

1082
02:00:03,470 --> 02:00:04,870
他需要我
He needs me.

1083
02:00:04,940 --> 02:00:09,040
你竟然会认为万能的上帝...
How can you imagine that God, the creator of heaven and Earth...

1084
02:00:09,110 --> 02:00:11,170
创造万物的神灵...
the source of all life...

1085
02:00:11,250 --> 02:00:15,450
可能会需要你?
could possibly need you?

1086
02:00:16,690 --> 02:00:17,780
我不知道
I don't know.

1087
02:00:17,850 --> 02:00:20,820
他无能到连自己的音讯都没法送?
You don't think He's big enough to deliver His own messages?

1088
02:00:21,690 --> 02:00:24,290
你要对我做什么?
What do you want from me?

1089
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:26,690
没什么 我是来放你走的
Nothing. I'm here to set you free.

1090
02:00:29,200 --> 02:00:31,630
笑一下 有人来了
I said smile. You have visitors.

1091
02:00:31,700 --> 02:00:33,690
勃艮第的公爵
The Duke of Burgundy.

1092
02:00:45,480 --> 02:00:48,080
这位就是声名显赫的贞德吧...
So here's the famous Jeanne...

1093
02:00:48,150 --> 02:00:51,680
奥尔良的救世主 英国人的噩梦
savior of Orleans, terror of the English.

1094
02:00:51,750 --> 02:00:55,380
你要多少赎金 我的国王都会给的
My king will pay any ransom you ask.

1095
02:00:55,460 --> 02:00:58,950
你的国王? 是啊 当然
Your king? Oh, yes, of course.

1096
02:00:59,030 --> 02:01:01,790
可他付给我什么呢? 是牛? 还是鸡?
What's he gonna pay me with? Cows? Chickens?

1097
02:01:01,860 --> 02:01:05,320
我还是喜欢金子 英国人给了我不少
I prefer gold, and the English have plenty.

1098
02:01:06,700 --> 02:01:10,540
不知道为了抓住奥尔良的巫婆 他们会付多少钱呢
I wonder how much they'll pay to have the witch of Orleans in their clutches.

1099
02:01:10,610 --> 02:01:15,270
英国人一向傲慢 无法接受被一个村姑击败的事实
The English are so arrogant, they can't accept being defeated by a peasant girl.

1100
02:01:15,340 --> 02:01:17,870
那肯定是魔鬼干的
It has to have been the devil's work.

1101
02:01:17,950 --> 02:01:20,440
是上帝打败了英军
God defeated the English.

1102
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:22,980
那也是上帝让你被俘的?
And God allowed you to be caught?

1103
02:01:24,590 --> 02:01:26,320
从个人来说 我不信上帝
Personally, I don't believe in God.

1104
02:01:26,390 --> 02:01:28,860
我也不信魔鬼
I don't believe in the devil either.

1105
02:01:28,920 --> 02:01:31,860
所以我从来不会失望
That's why I'm never disappointed.

1106
02:01:33,860 --> 02:01:35,520
卖了她
Sell her.

1107
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:54,240
为了付贞德的赎金
To payJeanne's ransom.

1108
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:57,550
这是将军们凑的钱 还有奥尔良的百姓
The captains gave what they could, as well as citizens of Orleans.

1109
02:01:57,620 --> 02:02:02,350
你们太慷慨了 有多少?
That's very generous of you. How much?

1110
02:02:02,430 --> 02:02:05,390
 一万金克郎  一万?
 Ten thousand gold crowns.  Ten thousand?

1111
02:02:05,460 --> 02:02:07,120
真不少啊
That's a lot.

1112
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:11,220
阁下 这件棘手的谈判就由您负责吧
Your Grace, I place you in charge of this very delicate negotiation.

1113
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:29,040
收拾好 你要走了
Get yourself ready. You're leaving.

1114
02:02:32,150 --> 02:02:33,750
你是谁?
Who are you?

1115
02:02:33,820 --> 02:02:36,920
皮埃尔·戈尚 博韦的主教
Pierre Cauchon, bishop of Beauvais.

1116
02:02:36,990 --> 02:02:40,760
既然在我的教区抓获了你 那你的审判由我负责
As you were captured in my diocese, the duty to conduct the trial falls upon me.

1117
02:02:41,960 --> 02:02:45,660
审判? 什么审判?
Trial? What trial?

1118
02:02:45,740 --> 02:02:49,430
审判你 贞德 异端邪说罪
Your trial,Jeanne, on a charge of heresy.

1119
02:02:52,440 --> 02:02:54,240
可是我的国王...
But my king...

1120
02:02:55,980 --> 02:02:58,140
他没有付我的赎金?
Didn't he pay my ransom?

1121
02:02:58,210 --> 02:03:01,010
似乎英国人比法国人更关心你
It seems the English care more about you than the French.

1122
02:03:01,080 --> 02:03:03,610
 英国人?  是啊
 The English?  Yes.

1123
02:03:03,690 --> 02:03:05,480
英国人付了你的赎金
They paid your ransom.

1124
02:03:05,550 --> 02:03:09,650
明天你就被送到他们在鲁昂的城堡
Tomorrow you'll be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.

1125
02:04:10,850 --> 02:04:14,880
虔诚的英格兰及法兰西国王亨利六世...
Our serene and Christian king, Henry VI, king of England and France...

1126
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:18,320
把这个女孩交给我们 控告她异端邪说罪...
has placed this girl in our hands, accused of heretical deeds...

1127
02:04:18,390 --> 02:04:20,760
为了确保审判忠实
to be tried in a matter of faith.

1128
02:04:20,830 --> 02:04:23,130
请你手持福音...
Take the Holy Gospels in your hand...

1129
02:04:23,200 --> 02:04:26,860
发誓不论回答什么都要诚实
and swear to tell the truth regarding anything you may be asked.

1130
02:04:28,270 --> 02:04:32,640
我不知道你要问我什么 可能有些我不想回答
I don't know what you will ask me. You may ask things I won't want to answer.

1131
02:04:32,710 --> 02:04:35,840
你要发誓对问你的一切 都要诚实回答
You will swear to tell the truth about everything you are asked.

1132
02:04:35,910 --> 02:04:40,310
我愿意诚恳地诉说一切
I will willingly tell the truth about all Earthly things.

1133
02:04:40,380 --> 02:04:44,610
可遵照我得到的启示 我只给我的国王一个人讲
But as to my revelations, I've told no one except my king...

1134
02:04:45,820 --> 02:04:48,760
查尔斯七世 法兰西唯一的国王
Charles VII, the one and only king of France.

1135
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:53,330
你必须发誓
You must take the oath.

1136
02:04:53,400 --> 02:04:56,990
就算是国王也不准拒绝发誓
Not even a king would refuse to take an oath in a matter of faith.

1137
02:04:57,070 --> 02:04:59,760
可以告诉你的 我自然会讲
I will tell you all that I'm allowed to tell you.

1138
02:05:01,100 --> 02:05:03,040
可至于其他的...
But as for the rest...

1139
02:05:03,110 --> 02:05:06,470
就算你杀了我 我也不会说的
even if you threatened to cut off my head, I won't tell you.

1140
02:05:11,950 --> 02:05:16,250
那先告诉我们你的名字 这总可以说吧
Begin by telling us your name, assuming you're allowed to tell us that much.

1141
02:05:18,050 --> 02:05:19,820
我叫贞德
My name is Jeanne.

1142
02:05:21,190 --> 02:05:24,750
我的小十字架被拿走了 可以还给我吗?
My little cross was taken from me. May I have it back?

1143
02:05:24,830 --> 02:05:27,990
那你必须先更合作些
Show us a little more cooperation first.

1144
02:05:28,060 --> 02:05:30,220
你出生于何处?
Where were you born?

1145
02:05:30,300 --> 02:05:32,860
一个叫栋雷米的村子
In a village called Domremy.

1146
02:05:32,940 --> 02:05:34,870
你多大了?
How old are you?

1147
02:05:34,940 --> 02:05:37,300
十九吧 差不多
Nineteen, or thereabouts.

1148
02:05:37,370 --> 02:05:39,270
你入教了吗?
Were you baptized?

1149
02:05:40,440 --> 02:05:43,040
 是的  那背诵一下天主经
 Yes.  Recite our Lord's Prayer.

1150
02:05:44,910 --> 02:05:48,440
除非你听我做忏悔
Not unless you hear my confession.

1151
02:05:52,390 --> 02:05:54,690
你给我听好了
Listen to me very carefully.

1152
02:05:54,760 --> 02:05:57,190
我们都是虔诚的人...
We are all men of faith...

1153
02:05:57,260 --> 02:06:01,720
我们会诚心的拯救你和你的灵魂...
and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of your body and your soul...

1154
02:06:01,800 --> 02:06:06,500
教堂的大门永远向迷途知返的人敞开
in the name of our Church who never closes arms to those who return to her.

1155
02:06:06,570 --> 02:06:08,590
可如果你不承认我们的评判和权威...
But we cannot help you...

1156
02:06:08,670 --> 02:06:11,470
我们就无法帮助你
unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority.

1157
02:06:11,540 --> 02:06:14,740
这是给你的提醒...
Take heed of this charitable admonition...

1158
02:06:14,810 --> 02:06:16,940
如果你坚持拒绝我们的帮助...
for if you persist in refusing our help...

1159
02:06:17,010 --> 02:06:21,570
那我们就不得不把你交给其他部门处理了
we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers.

1160
02:06:21,650 --> 02:06:24,520
等待你的惩罚我想你很清楚
And I think you know well enough the punishment that would await you.

1161
02:06:30,130 --> 02:06:32,090
现在...
Now...

1162
02:06:32,160 --> 02:06:35,190
你愿意背诵一下天主经吗?
will you please recite our Lord's Prayer?

1163
02:06:37,830 --> 02:06:40,500
除非你听我做忏悔
Not unless you hear my confession.

1164
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:48,240
当心 拒绝承认审判对你没有好处的
Be careful. You aren't helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment.

1165
02:06:48,310 --> 02:06:50,240
你们...
You...

1166
02:06:50,310 --> 02:06:53,280
声称是审判我的人 你们才该当心!
who claim to be my judges, you be careful!

1167
02:06:54,350 --> 02:06:56,980
早晚有一天你们也会遭到审判的
For you too one day will be judged.

1168
02:06:57,050 --> 02:06:58,680
卫兵 把她带走!
Guards, take the prisoner away!

1169
02:07:01,720 --> 02:07:03,890
 肃静!  她是巫婆!
 Silence!  Sorceress!

1170
02:07:03,960 --> 02:07:07,330
肃静! 肃静!
Silence! Clear the room!

1171
02:07:07,400 --> 02:07:10,060
肃静!
Clear the room!

1172
02:07:11,870 --> 02:07:16,430
以后我们要秘密调查 避免受到民众的压力
In future, we should conduct inquiries privately, away from public pressure.

1173
02:07:16,510 --> 02:07:19,800
英国人愿意烧死她就烧死她吧 为什么要把我们扯进来呢?
Let the English burn her if they want. Why does it have to involve us?

1174
02:07:19,880 --> 02:07:23,210
因为找出她异端的罪证是我们的职责
Because it's our duty to root out heresy wherever we find it.

1175
02:07:25,310 --> 02:07:26,470
文森特神父
Father Vincente.

1176
02:07:28,520 --> 02:07:30,820
您是我们当中最受人尊敬的人 您怎么看?
You're the most venerable among us. What do you think?

1177
02:07:30,890 --> 02:07:33,410
我认为这个审判是假冒的...
I think this trial is a masquerade...

1178
02:07:33,490 --> 02:07:36,050
我不会再参与了
and I won't be part of it anymore.

1179
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:39,620
我乐意作她的审判 而不是刽子手
I'm willing to be her judge, but not her executioner.

1180
02:07:39,700 --> 02:07:41,630
这一点我会保证
That's what I'm trying to ensure.

1181
02:07:44,830 --> 02:07:50,470
判决是在审判结束时下的 戈尚 不是在开始
The verdict comes at the end of a trial, Cauchon. Not at the beginning.

1182
02:07:52,240 --> 02:07:54,400
我要回罗马去...
I am going back to Rome...

1183
02:07:54,480 --> 02:07:57,640
向教皇报告此事
to give my report to our Holy Father, the Pope.

1184
02:08:00,150 --> 02:08:04,680
这太荒谬了 我倒成了被审判的人
This is ridiculous. Now I'm the one who's on trial and being judged.

1185
02:08:04,750 --> 02:08:06,810
 把他扣起来  你们干什么?
 Arrest him.  What are you doing?

1186
02:08:06,890 --> 02:08:10,150
这是教会法庭 你们无权这么做
This is an ecclesiastical court. You've no right to do this.

1187
02:08:10,230 --> 02:08:12,460
这是在英国的领地
This is English territory.

1188
02:08:12,530 --> 02:08:14,550
我有权做任何事
I have the right to do anything.

1189
02:08:14,630 --> 02:08:16,830
明白了吗?
Is that clear?

1190
02:08:32,850 --> 02:08:34,510
天上的神啊...
Our Father who art in heaven...

1191
02:08:34,580 --> 02:08:36,550
请在天堂...
Thy kingdom come...

1192
02:08:41,520 --> 02:08:43,750
宽恕我们...宽恕他们...
Forgive us...Forgive them...

1193
02:08:43,830 --> 02:08:47,060
宽恕他们吧 宽恕我们吧 宽恕他们吧
Forgive them, then forgive us. Forgive them.

1194
02:08:47,130 --> 02:08:48,530
你这是在念叨什么?
Why were you yelling?

1195
02:08:53,540 --> 02:08:57,130
你在这儿做什么? 你不能待在这里! 走开!
What are you doing here? You can't stay here! Go away!

1196
02:08:57,210 --> 02:08:59,970
为什么? 你在等其他人吗?
Why? Are you waiting for someone else?

1197
02:09:01,080 --> 02:09:02,170
是的
Yes.

1198
02:09:02,910 --> 02:09:05,640
 谁?  我的幻觉
 Who?  My visions.

1199
02:09:05,710 --> 02:09:07,310
你的幻觉
Your visions.

1200
02:09:08,520 --> 02:09:10,510
他们会来这里见你?
They're going to visit you in here?

1201
02:09:10,590 --> 02:09:13,490
是的 我是这么恳求的
Yes. That's what I pray for.

1202
02:09:14,290 --> 02:09:17,550
我倒想看看 介意我坐在这边吗?
I want to see that. Do you mind if I stay on the side here?

1203
02:09:17,630 --> 02:09:18,850
 我不会打扰你的  不行!
 I won't bother you.  No!

1204
02:09:20,460 --> 02:09:22,090
不行! 你不能待在这里!
No, you can't! You can't!

1205
02:09:22,160 --> 02:09:24,160
 否则他们就不会来了  为什么不会?
 Or else they won't come.  Why won't they?

1206
02:09:24,230 --> 02:09:26,430
因为我一定要一个人
Because I have to be alone.

1207
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:30,200
算了 反正他们不会来的
Oh. They won't come anyway.

1208
02:09:31,110 --> 02:09:33,940
 你什么意思 他们不会来吗?  他们为什么来呢?
 What do you mean, they won't come?  Why would they?

1209
02:09:35,140 --> 02:09:38,170
因为我一直对上帝很忠诚啊...
Because I've always been faithful to God...

1210
02:09:38,250 --> 02:09:40,110
他所有的指示我都照做了...
and I've followed everything He's ever said...

1211
02:09:40,180 --> 02:09:42,340
他要求的事我都做到了
and I've done everything He's ever asked me to do.

1212
02:09:42,420 --> 02:09:44,210
上帝要你做事情?
God asked you to do something?

1213
02:09:48,560 --> 02:09:50,390
是的 很多事
Yes, lots of things.

1214
02:09:50,460 --> 02:09:53,720
你的意思是 上帝他说...
You mean, God said...

1215
02:09:53,800 --> 02:09:55,590
"贞德 我需要你"?
"I need you,Jeanne"?

1216
02:09:58,330 --> 02:10:01,130
可他给了我许多征兆
But He's sent me signs.

1217
02:10:02,910 --> 02:10:05,470
征兆? 什么征兆?
Signs? What signs?

1218
02:10:07,680 --> 02:10:09,410
风 风
The wind. The wind.

1219
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:14,880
风
Wind.

1220
02:10:14,950 --> 02:10:17,940
还有云 钟声
And the clouds. Ringing.

1221
02:10:20,620 --> 02:10:22,250
钟声 云
Ringing cloud.

1222
02:10:23,230 --> 02:10:25,220
跳舞 还有跳舞
The dance. The dance.

1223
02:10:39,810 --> 02:10:42,780
剑 田野里的剑
The sword. The sword lying in the field.

1224
02:10:42,840 --> 02:10:44,510
那就是征兆
That was a sign.

1225
02:10:44,580 --> 02:10:48,020
不 那只是田野里的一把剑
No. That was a sword in a field.

1226
02:10:49,220 --> 02:10:52,090
不 不 那是征兆
No. No. That was a sign.

1227
02:10:52,150 --> 02:10:55,090
不 那只是田野里的一把剑
No, that was a sword in a field.

1228
02:10:55,160 --> 02:10:59,220
可它不会自己跑到那里的
It can't just get there by itself. It can't.

1229
02:10:59,290 --> 02:11:02,290
剑不会自己跑到那里的
A sword just doesn't get there by itself.

1230
02:11:02,360 --> 02:11:07,100
没错 任何事都会有无数可能 你为何非取其中的一种呢?
True. Every event has an infinite number of causes, so why pick one?

1231
02:11:07,170 --> 02:11:09,640
要在田野里出现剑有很多途径
There are many ways a sword might find itself in a field.

1232
02:11:14,840 --> 02:11:18,610
看来这种解释不错 那这种呢?
Seems a perfectly valid explanation, but how about this one?

1233
02:11:24,650 --> 02:11:26,640
也不错 还有其他可能
Then again, there are other possibilities.

1234
02:11:31,460 --> 02:11:32,650
还有更快的
Or even faster.

1235
02:11:36,230 --> 02:11:39,220
还没有算其它的
And that's without counting the inexplicable.

1236
02:11:41,600 --> 02:11:45,840
有这么多可能 你却偏偏选这个
Yet from an infinite number of possibilities, you had to pick this one.

1237
02:11:59,550 --> 02:12:03,350
你看到的不是真相 贞德
You didn't see what was,Jeanne.

1238
02:12:03,430 --> 02:12:06,660
你看到的是你想要看的罢了
You saw what you wanted to see.

1239
02:12:22,940 --> 02:12:26,680
你说有声音对你说话...
This voice that you say appears to you...

1240
02:12:26,750 --> 02:12:30,840
是天使说的还是圣人说的 或者是上帝亲自说的?
is it an angel or a saint, or does it come from God?

1241
02:12:30,920 --> 02:12:35,360
我不再跟你说那些了
I won't tell you any more about that.

1242
02:12:35,420 --> 02:12:37,920
不是怕回答你 是怕惹怒上帝
I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you.

1243
02:12:37,990 --> 02:12:42,860
你怕说实话会惹怒上帝?
You're afraid of displeasing God by telling the truth?

1244
02:12:42,930 --> 02:12:46,300
难道上帝禁止你说实话?
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?

1245
02:12:46,370 --> 02:12:50,300
我只跟法国国王说 不是你
My revelations were for the king of France, not for you.

1246
02:12:52,370 --> 02:12:54,930
你第一眼看见国王时...
When you saw your king for the first time...

1247
02:12:55,010 --> 02:12:57,410
他头顶上有天使在飞吗?
was there an angel over his head?

1248
02:12:57,480 --> 02:12:59,240
可能有 我没有看见
If there was one, I did not see it.

1249
02:12:59,310 --> 02:13:02,280
没有任何证明 你的国王凭什么相信你?
Why did your king believe in you without any proof?

1250
02:13:03,290 --> 02:13:04,880
你问他去
Go ask him yourself.

1251
02:13:18,530 --> 02:13:19,560
晚饭
Dinner.

1252
02:13:36,050 --> 02:13:39,320
你被抓时 是骑着马吗?
When you were taken prisoner, did you have a horse?

1253
02:13:39,390 --> 02:13:42,820
是的 有一半战马血统 黑色的
Yes. A half steed. Black.

1254
02:13:42,890 --> 02:13:45,450
 马是谁给你的?  国王
 Who gave you that horse?  My king.

1255
02:13:45,530 --> 02:13:47,930
他给了你多少?
How many did he give you?

1256
02:13:50,100 --> 02:13:52,570
五匹战马...
Five steeds...

1257
02:13:52,630 --> 02:13:55,300
还有几匹一般的马
and a few hackneys.

1258
02:13:55,370 --> 02:13:58,530
不少啊 赶上侯爵们了 真是光荣啊
As much as for a lord. What an honor.

1259
02:13:58,610 --> 02:14:01,200
除了这些马 国王还有没有给你其他财富?
Did your king give you other wealth apart from those horses?

1260
02:14:03,250 --> 02:14:06,610
那些给你的衣服呢?
What about all those dresses you were given?

1261
02:14:06,680 --> 02:14:08,150
是丝绸的 对吗?
Silk dresses, weren't they?

1262
02:14:09,350 --> 02:14:10,440
是的
Yes.

1263
02:14:10,520 --> 02:14:13,110
是给过我一些
Yes, I was given a few.

1264
02:14:13,190 --> 02:14:16,950
可我从没有时间穿
But I never had time to wear them.

1265
02:14:17,030 --> 02:14:20,520
作为一个农民来说算很富有了 你有什么好说的?
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl, wouldn't you say?

1266
02:14:23,030 --> 02:14:27,060
作为上帝的仆人 你看来也很富有 你有什么好说?
You look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?

1267
02:14:32,510 --> 02:14:34,700
是你带人进攻巴黎的 是吗?
You launched an attack on Paris, didn't you?

1268
02:14:34,780 --> 02:14:36,800
是我
I tried to.

1269
02:14:36,880 --> 02:14:39,040
你有没有以上帝的名义...
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city...

1270
02:14:39,110 --> 02:14:40,480
命令巴黎的百姓献城投降?
in the name of the King of Heaven?

1271
02:14:40,550 --> 02:14:44,750
不 我说 "向法兰西国王投降吧"
No. I said, "Surrender in the name of the king of France."

1272
02:14:44,820 --> 02:14:47,410
证据上不是这么写的
That is not what is written in the evidence.

1273
02:14:49,090 --> 02:14:50,490
你自己看
Look yourself.

1274
02:14:50,560 --> 02:14:53,760
我不识字
I can't read.

1275
02:14:55,360 --> 02:14:57,850
我忘了
Yes, I forgot.

1276
02:14:57,930 --> 02:15:01,990
上帝竟然派了个不识字的使者来完成这么重要的使命
God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission.

1277
02:15:02,070 --> 02:15:04,230
你认为上帝这么做 对吗?
Do you think that God made the right decision?

1278
02:15:04,310 --> 02:15:08,800
让一个无知的女孩来拯救法国?
To take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?

1279
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:10,540
这只有上帝能回答
I leave that answer to God.

1280
02:15:15,320 --> 02:15:17,050
靠!
Fuck!

1281
02:15:17,120 --> 02:15:19,110
冷静一下 大人 求你了
Calm down, my lord. I beg you.

1282
02:15:19,190 --> 02:15:22,250
我现在是整个朝廷的笑柄 我怎么冷静得下来?
How can I when I'm made the laughingstock of the whole court?

1283
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:24,690
你也看见了 这女孩对付百姓很有一套...
You've seen how it is. This girl has a way with people...

1284
02:15:24,760 --> 02:15:26,920
可我们每天都还是有进展的
but we're making progress every day.

1285
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:30,950
只要这娘们还活着 我们军队就拒绝打仗 你明白么?
As long as that bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight. Understand?

1286
02:15:31,030 --> 02:15:32,830
他们要确定上帝是站在我们这边
They need proof that God is on their side.

1287
02:15:32,900 --> 02:15:35,700
我们不能烧死她 你们才能那么做
It's not for us to burn her. That's your prerogative.

1288
02:15:35,770 --> 02:15:37,570
你们的任务就是找出她的罪过!
And it's your prerogative to find her guilty!

1289
02:15:37,640 --> 02:15:40,900
除非她承认亵渎了上帝 否则我们不能那么做
But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy.

1290
02:15:40,980 --> 02:15:42,500
你还等什么?
What are you waiting for?

1291
02:15:42,580 --> 02:15:45,880
这城堡里的刑具应有尽有 严刑拷打啊!
You've got a castle full of racks, ropes and pulleys. Torture the bitch!

1292
02:15:45,950 --> 02:15:48,850
那样她什么都不会说的
You'll never get anything out of her that way.

1293
02:15:48,920 --> 02:15:51,680
还有...
And besides...

1294
02:15:51,750 --> 02:15:56,920
我的几个同僚...已经害怕了
you must realize that several of my colleagues are, well, scared.

1295
02:15:56,990 --> 02:15:59,760
害怕? 害怕一个女孩?
Scared? Of a girl?

1296
02:15:59,830 --> 02:16:02,460
害怕犯错误
Scared to make a mistake.

1297
02:16:02,530 --> 02:16:04,760
万一她是对的呢
Suppose she's right.

1298
02:16:04,830 --> 02:16:07,300
万一她真是上帝派来的呢
Suppose she has been sent by God.

1299
02:16:11,770 --> 02:16:16,510
 你站在谁那边 戈尚?  我只站在教会这边
 Who's side are you on, Cauchon?  I'm on the side of Holy Mother Church.

1300
02:16:17,550 --> 02:16:19,640
你有剑吗?
Do you have a sword?

1301
02:16:21,120 --> 02:16:23,280
 有不少  你不是还常带着旗吗?
 Quite a few.  Didn't you also carry a banner?

1302
02:16:24,820 --> 02:16:25,840
是的
Yes.

1303
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:29,150
你更喜欢哪个? 旗还是剑?
Which do you prefer? Your banner or your sword?

1304
02:16:29,220 --> 02:16:31,750
我绝对是喜欢我的旗
I was 40 times more fond of my banner.

1305
02:16:31,830 --> 02:16:34,760
为什么? 它有什么特殊的价值或者力量?
Why? Did it have some particular value or power?

1306
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:39,720
只是...
It's just...

1307
02:16:39,800 --> 02:16:42,600
 剑是武器  所以呢?
 A sword is a weapon.  And?

1308
02:16:43,710 --> 02:16:47,870
所以 我更喜欢旗
And so, I prefer my banner.

1309
02:16:47,940 --> 02:16:49,070
为什么?
Why?

1310
02:16:49,140 --> 02:16:52,110
我不想杀人
To avoid killing anyone.

1311
02:16:52,180 --> 02:16:55,270
你是说如果你没有一直拿着旗的话...
Are you saying if you'd not been carrying your banner...

1312
02:16:55,350 --> 02:16:56,870
你就会杀更多的人?
you'd have killed more people?

1313
02:17:01,190 --> 02:17:03,160
不是这个意思 我从没有杀过人
Of course not. I never killed anyone.

1314
02:17:03,220 --> 02:17:05,990
拿剑时杀人的欲望...
Then perhaps the temptation...

1315
02:17:06,060 --> 02:17:08,150
可能就会更强烈吧...
to kill would have been stronger...

1316
02:17:08,230 --> 02:17:10,130
非常强烈
too strong, perhaps.

1317
02:17:11,670 --> 02:17:13,690
我警告过英国人 让他们撤军
I warned the English to go back home.

1318
02:17:13,770 --> 02:17:16,290
我请求他们不要与我们为敌 他们知道我...
I begged them not to force us to fight. They knew that I...

1319
02:17:16,370 --> 02:17:18,840
我们有很多证人可以证明...
We have numerous witnesses who can confirm...

1320
02:17:18,910 --> 02:17:20,900
你不是一直拿着那面旗的
you were not always carrying your banner.

1321
02:17:25,110 --> 02:17:26,840
是的 可能吧
Yes, perhaps.

1322
02:17:26,920 --> 02:17:29,180
有时你只拿着你的剑
Sometimes you were carrying just your sword.

1323
02:17:30,920 --> 02:17:32,750
是的 我不清楚
Yes. I don't know.

1324
02:17:32,820 --> 02:17:34,950
你有没有用过手中的剑呢?
Did you use the sword you held in your hand?

1325
02:17:35,020 --> 02:17:37,180
是的 我用过...我把它高高举起...
Yes, I used it...I held it up...

1326
02:17:37,260 --> 02:17:40,660
你是把剑高高举起 然后就像这样挥动吧!
You held up your sword and flourished it about like this!

1327
02:17:40,730 --> 02:17:41,750
我不记得了
I don't remember.

1328
02:17:41,830 --> 02:17:44,800
所以你在战场上 手持利剑...
So, you were on the battlefield with your sword in your hand...

1329
02:17:44,870 --> 02:17:47,890
高高的挥舞...
waving it above your head, charging against the enemy...

1330
02:17:47,970 --> 02:17:50,440
为了保全性命大声叫嚷着同敌人战斗...
screaming at the enemy, fighting for your life...

1331
02:17:50,510 --> 02:17:52,300
而你却要我们相信...
and you expect us to believe...

1332
02:17:52,370 --> 02:17:55,900
在这么激烈的过程中...
that in the middle of all this excitement...

1333
02:17:55,980 --> 02:18:00,240
你没杀过一个人
you never killed anyone.

1334
02:18:00,320 --> 02:18:03,770
是 我没杀过人
No. I never killed anyone.

1335
02:18:05,820 --> 02:18:07,520
我不相信 你撒谎了
I can't believe you can lie like that.

1336
02:18:07,590 --> 02:18:10,850
我没说谎 没说谎 别烦我 我不记得了
I'm not lying. I'm not lying. Leave me alone. I can't remember.

1337
02:18:10,930 --> 02:18:14,120
 我没杀过人 我不记得了  那我来帮你回忆一下
 I didn't kill anyone. I can't remember.  Let me help your memory.

1338
02:18:14,760 --> 02:18:17,530
我不想听了 别烦我 我没有杀那个人
I don't want to hear any more. Leave me alone. I didn't kill that man.

1339
02:18:17,600 --> 02:18:19,030
别烦我!
Leave me alone!

1340
02:18:19,100 --> 02:18:21,970
停下 停下 我不记得了
Stop. Stop. I can't remember.

1341
02:18:22,040 --> 02:18:26,300
战斗昏天暗地的 我只是尽可能的保护好自己
The battles were so confusing. I was only defending myself as best I could.

1342
02:18:26,370 --> 02:18:30,400
烟火弥漫 叫喊连天 我又四面受敌
There was so much dust, smoke and noise. I was being attacked on all sides.

1343
02:18:30,480 --> 02:18:33,280
可能我是还击了
So maybe perhaps I fought back.

1344
02:18:33,350 --> 02:18:36,370
 可那只是为了保护自己  看来你想起来了
 But it was only to defend myself.  So your memory's coming back.

1345
02:18:36,450 --> 02:18:38,420
 是的  很好
 Yes.  Good.

1346
02:18:38,490 --> 02:18:42,720
那你告诉我为什么上帝会让战争爆发呢
Now, you tell me why God let all those battles happen in the first place.

1347
02:18:42,790 --> 02:18:44,350
他如此的强大 你还说...
He's so powerful. You said...

1348
02:18:44,430 --> 02:18:46,720
"他创造万物 是天地之主"
" He's the creator of heaven and Earth, the source of all life."

1349
02:18:46,800 --> 02:18:50,060
他可以轻易地阻止 那些流血和不幸的发生
He could easily have stopped all that blood and misery.

1350
02:18:50,130 --> 02:18:51,100
为什么没这么做?
Why didn't He...

1351
02:18:51,170 --> 02:18:54,160
是他在散播流血和不幸吗?
Is He the one who spread all that blood and misery?

1352
02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:56,400
 是他吗?  不是 可他应该阻止这一切的
 Is He?  No. But He could have stopped it.

1353
02:18:56,470 --> 02:18:59,270
看到我们以他的名义...互相残杀...
What, did he get pleasure...pleasure...

1354
02:18:59,340 --> 02:19:02,970
他感到很愉悦吗?
pleasure from watching us killing each other in His name?

1355
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:05,540
以他的名义?
In His name?

1356
02:19:05,610 --> 02:19:08,880
是以他的名义 我们以他的名义互相战斗和杀戮...
In His name. We fought and killed in His name...

1357
02:19:08,950 --> 02:19:11,080
 以上帝的名义  真的吗?
 the King of Heaven.  Really?

1358
02:19:11,150 --> 02:19:13,780
所有爱我的人哪 跟我冲啊!
Let all those who love me follow me!

1359
02:19:13,860 --> 02:19:16,480
"所有爱我的人 跟我冲!"
"Let all who love me follow me!"

1360
02:19:16,560 --> 02:19:19,120
哪里提到上帝了?
Where does God get mentioned?

1361
02:19:19,190 --> 02:19:21,590
算了吧 贞德
Come on,Jeanne.

1362
02:19:21,660 --> 02:19:23,460
诚实些吧
Be honest.

1363
02:19:23,530 --> 02:19:26,360
你是为你自己而战 以自己的名义而战
You fought for yourself. In your name.

1364
02:19:26,430 --> 02:19:28,490
不是的!
No!

1365
02:19:28,570 --> 02:19:30,940
我只是尽可能的在保护自己
I was defending myself as best as I could.

1366
02:19:31,010 --> 02:19:33,800
保护自己是没有错的 不是吗?
Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?

1367
02:19:33,880 --> 02:19:36,240
是的 应该这样! 难道我要让自己去死吗?
Yes, they do! Should I have let myself get killed?

1368
02:19:36,310 --> 02:19:37,940
 要那样吗?  不 你做的很好
 Is that it?  No. You did fine.

1369
02:19:38,010 --> 02:19:39,980
甚至说做的很棒
I'd even say well done.

1370
02:19:40,050 --> 02:19:42,240
事实上...
As a matter of fact...

1371
02:19:42,320 --> 02:19:45,480
那你认为那些被你杀的人也是罪有应得了?
most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?

1372
02:19:49,020 --> 02:19:51,860
我从来不认为杀戮能换来和平
I never thought killing each other would bring about any peace.

1373
02:19:51,930 --> 02:19:52,820
我同意
I agree.

1374
02:19:52,890 --> 02:19:55,390
只有跟英国人战斗才能换来和平
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance.

1375
02:19:55,460 --> 02:19:58,560
我不同意 你的想法为什么变来变去呢?
I don't agree. Why do you keep changing your mind all the time?

1376
02:20:00,300 --> 02:20:02,460
是你 为什么...
You. Why...

1377
02:20:02,540 --> 02:20:05,170
你为什么要这么对我?
Why are you doing this to me?

1378
02:20:05,240 --> 02:20:07,400
伤害我 你感到很快乐吗?
Do you get pleasure from hurting me?

1379
02:20:07,480 --> 02:20:11,380
快乐 真是个难以定义的词汇
Pleasure. That's a difficult word to define.

1380
02:20:13,150 --> 02:20:17,380
痛苦何时结束? 快乐何时开始? 你的快乐是何时开始的?
When does pain end and pleasure begin? When did your pleasure begin?

1381
02:20:17,450 --> 02:20:21,650
是你手持利剑的时候吗?
With that sword in your hand?

1382
02:20:22,920 --> 02:20:26,120
伤害其他人...
I never took pleasure...

1383
02:20:26,190 --> 02:20:28,660
我从不会感到快乐
in hurting anyone.

1384
02:20:29,700 --> 02:20:31,190
真的吗?
Really?

1385
02:20:56,290 --> 02:21:00,090
放我走吧 放我走吧
Set me free. Set me free.

1386
02:21:00,160 --> 02:21:01,790
会的 贞德
You will be,Jeanne.

1387
02:21:02,930 --> 02:21:04,870
会的
You will be.

1388
02:21:26,050 --> 02:21:28,580
贞德 我最亲爱的教友...
Jeanne, my very dear friend in Christ...

1389
02:21:28,660 --> 02:21:30,590
所有审判员
we, your judges and assessors...

1390
02:21:30,660 --> 02:21:33,250
渴望得出一个真实公正的判决...
desirous of reaching a true and lawful verdict...

1391
02:21:33,330 --> 02:21:36,730
所以把你的审判发到巴黎大学...
submitted a transcript of your trial to the University of Paris...

1392
02:21:36,800 --> 02:21:38,060
征求了他们的意见
to attain their opinion.

1393
02:21:38,130 --> 02:21:40,600
经过慎重考虑...
After careful consideration...

1394
02:21:40,670 --> 02:21:42,690
学者们跟我们一致认定...
the learned scholars have concluded with us...

1395
02:21:42,770 --> 02:21:46,400
你已犯下多项重大罪行
that you have committed many grievous sins.

1396
02:21:46,470 --> 02:21:48,970
现在我要你仔细听他们的意见...
I ask you now to listen most carefully...

1397
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:51,980
具体如下
to their opinion, as detailed in these articles.

1398
02:21:54,850 --> 02:21:56,510
罪行一
Article One.

1399
02:21:56,580 --> 02:22:00,750
你自称是上帝命令你穿男人的衣服...
You said that by God's command you have continually worn men's clothes...

1400
02:22:00,820 --> 02:22:03,120
剪成男人的短发...
and that you have also worn your hair short...

1401
02:22:03,190 --> 02:22:06,350
无法将你同你的敌人分辨出来
with nothing to distinguish you from the soldiers with whom you fought.

1402
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,730
请不要遗弃我
Don't abandon me. Please.

1403
02:22:14,800 --> 02:22:17,970
您在哪里?
Where are You?

1404
02:22:18,040 --> 02:22:20,060
您在哪里啊?
Where are You? Please.

1405
02:22:24,110 --> 02:22:27,240
这就是您想要的吗?
Is this what You want?

1406
02:22:28,680 --> 02:22:31,380
您想要我...
You want me to...

1407
02:22:31,450 --> 02:22:33,850
在还没有...
to burn...

1408
02:22:33,920 --> 02:22:35,910
做忏悔的情况下...
without...

1409
02:22:35,990 --> 02:22:38,550
就被烧死吗?
being confessed?

1410
02:22:38,630 --> 02:22:41,690
最后 罪行十二
Finally, Article 1 2.

1411
02:22:41,760 --> 02:22:44,130
声称不愿服从...
You have said that you are not willing to submit yourself...

1412
02:22:44,200 --> 02:22:47,790
教会法庭的审判 只服从上帝
to the judgment of the church militant, but only to God.

1413
02:22:47,870 --> 02:22:49,800
对于这一点 学者们认为...
As to this article, the scholars say...

1414
02:22:49,870 --> 02:22:52,640
你藐视教会的权威
that you have no comprehension of the authority of the Church.

1415
02:22:52,710 --> 02:22:55,730
在信仰上你已误入歧途...
That you have perniciously erred in the faith of God...

1416
02:22:55,810 --> 02:22:59,470
追随迷信 偏离信仰...
and you are a child of superstition, a wanderer from the faith...

1417
02:22:59,550 --> 02:23:03,040
祈求和崇拜魔鬼...
an invoker of demons, an idolater...

1418
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:05,050
是个异端邪说者
and a heretic.

1419
02:23:16,060 --> 02:23:19,630
我们再一次诚恳地劝告你...
We once again admonish, beg and exalt you...

1420
02:23:19,700 --> 02:23:23,260
放弃你错误的信仰吧...
to cast out and recant your erroneous beliefs...

1421
02:23:23,340 --> 02:23:26,360
在悔过书上签名吧
by signing this recantation.

1422
02:23:27,510 --> 02:23:28,500
签吧
Please.

1423
02:23:30,240 --> 02:23:32,270
如果教会...
If the Church...

1424
02:23:32,350 --> 02:23:35,610
想要我说...
wants me to say...

1425
02:23:35,680 --> 02:23:38,080
我所见的都是邪恶的...
that my visions are evil...

1426
02:23:38,150 --> 02:23:41,090
那我宁愿不相信这个教会
then I do not believe in this Church.

1427
02:23:46,260 --> 02:23:47,520
让你的人做准备
Perform your office.

1428
02:23:53,670 --> 02:23:55,100
等等
Wait.

1429
02:23:59,040 --> 02:24:02,340
贞德 我求你了 签吧
Jeanne, I beg of you, sign.

1430
02:24:02,410 --> 02:24:05,470
看在上帝的份上 你不明白吗? 我这是在救你啊
In God's name, don't you understand? I'm trying to save you.

1431
02:24:05,550 --> 02:24:08,040
我想要做忏悔
I want to be confessed.

1432
02:24:09,380 --> 02:24:11,780
签了这个 你愿意的话我帮你做忏悔
Sign this and I will confess you myself, if you want.

1433
02:24:11,850 --> 02:24:16,520
那我可以...
And may I...

1434
02:24:16,590 --> 02:24:19,490
我可以去做弥撒吗?
May I go to Mass?

1435
02:24:19,560 --> 02:24:21,620
只要你愿意
As often as you like.

1436
02:24:21,700 --> 02:24:24,460
为了上帝 签了吧
Now, for the love of God, sign.

1437
02:24:29,800 --> 02:24:33,040
签了吧 贞德 这能让你免于枷锁
Sign,Jeanne, and you'll be free of your chains.

1438
02:24:33,110 --> 02:24:35,510
免于火刑 贞德
Free of the fire,Jeanne.

1439
02:25:10,450 --> 02:25:12,110
谢谢
Thank you.

1440
02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:18,780
你知道你刚才签的是什么吗?
Do you know what you just signed?

1441
02:25:18,850 --> 02:25:21,480
你签字放弃了"他是存在的"这一信念
You just signed away His existence.

1442
02:25:22,990 --> 02:25:27,390
 我不是这个意思  你认为 他是个骗子
 I didn't mean to.  For you, He's a lie.

1443
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:31,190
一切都是幻觉
An illusion.

1444
02:25:31,270 --> 02:25:33,460
不 不
No, no.

1445
02:25:33,530 --> 02:25:35,730
他说我可以做忏悔的
He told me that I would be confessed.

1446
02:25:36,640 --> 02:25:39,730
可你最终还是抛弃了他
In the end, it was you who abandoned Him.

1447
02:25:46,810 --> 02:25:49,310
 能再给我一下吗?  没什么好后悔的
 May I have that back, please?  You have nothing to regret.

1448
02:25:51,650 --> 02:25:54,210
还给我!
Give it back to me!

1449
02:25:54,290 --> 02:25:57,520
 还给我!  带她走!
 Give it back!  Take her away!

1450
02:26:02,230 --> 02:26:03,860
让她闭嘴!
Silence her!

1451
02:26:08,740 --> 02:26:10,900
给 她已经放弃了邪恶的信仰
There. She has recanted.

1452
02:26:10,970 --> 02:26:13,340
并且我们接受她的悔过...
And we accept her repentance...

1453
02:26:13,410 --> 02:26:16,870
教会的大门永远向迷途知返的人敞开
for the Church never closes her arms to those who would return to the fold.

1454
02:26:18,610 --> 02:26:22,810
是否处死她是你的事 不是我们的了
Now she's your martyr, not ours.

1455
02:26:49,110 --> 02:26:50,940
不要!
Please!

1456
02:26:57,450 --> 02:26:59,780
可以了
Enough.

1457
02:27:05,830 --> 02:27:07,920
给
Here.

1458
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:11,800
想穿衣服的话就试试这身吧
If you want to get dressed, try these for size.

1459
02:27:18,040 --> 02:27:20,510
大主教
My lord bishop.

1460
02:27:30,250 --> 02:27:32,190
您自己看看
Come to see for yourself.

1461
02:27:32,250 --> 02:27:34,520
你来看
Well, take a look.

1462
02:27:39,660 --> 02:27:42,150
看见了吗? 又换成男人打扮了
You see? Dressed as a man again.

1463
02:27:42,230 --> 02:27:44,530
看来悔过不顶什么用啊?
Her touching repentance didn't last very long, did it?

1464
02:27:46,100 --> 02:27:50,870
桑利斯的主教刚巧路过 他目击了一切
The Bishop of Senlis was passing by and was on hand to witness her relapse.

1465
02:27:53,340 --> 02:27:56,440
凭空出现那衣服可真是奇迹啊?
And by what miracle did these clothes find their way in here?

1466
02:27:56,510 --> 02:27:58,640
那不是神迹 亲爱的戈尚
Not a miracle, my dear Cauchon.

1467
02:27:58,710 --> 02:28:00,980
是邪恶的魔咒
An evil spell.

1468
02:28:01,050 --> 02:28:04,380
那女孩是巫婆 明天要施以火刑
This girl is a witch, and tomorrow she will burn for it.

1469
02:28:06,320 --> 02:28:09,080
在菜市口做好准备
Have the stake prepared in the marketplace.

1470
02:28:24,110 --> 02:28:28,010
贞德 我真是不明白 你为什么要这么做?
Jeanne, I don't understand. Why did you do it?

1471
02:28:28,080 --> 02:28:29,870
 为什么啊?  那你呢
 Why?  And you.

1472
02:28:29,940 --> 02:28:32,140
为什么要撒谎?
Why did you lie?

1473
02:28:32,210 --> 02:28:34,010
你答应我要听我忏悔的
You promised to have me confessed.

1474
02:28:34,080 --> 02:28:36,980
我知道 可那是当时为了救你
I know. It was the only way to have you saved from the fire.

1475
02:28:37,050 --> 02:28:40,350
我要救的不是我的身躯
It's not my body I want to save.

1476
02:28:40,420 --> 02:28:42,080
而是我的灵魂
It's my soul.

1477
02:28:43,720 --> 02:28:46,450
我只求你一件事
I ask only one thing.

1478
02:28:46,530 --> 02:28:50,260
请听我做忏悔
Please, hear my confession.

1479
02:28:53,970 --> 02:28:57,800
不行 贞德 我不能听你做忏悔
I can't,Jeanne. I can't hear your confession.

1480
02:29:01,140 --> 02:29:03,080
非常抱歉
I'm very sorry.

1481
02:29:24,070 --> 02:29:25,970
你要做忏悔?
You want to confess?

1482
02:29:29,970 --> 02:29:32,460
我在听啊
I'm listening.

1483
02:29:32,540 --> 02:29:34,840
主啊 我有罪
I've committed sins, my Lord.

1484
02:29:38,050 --> 02:29:39,950
很多的罪
So many sins.

1485
02:29:43,420 --> 02:29:47,250
我看见了那么多的征兆
I saw so many signs.

1486
02:29:47,320 --> 02:29:49,380
那么多"征兆"
Many signs.

1487
02:29:51,330 --> 02:29:53,560
那些我想看见的
The ones I wanted to see.

1488
02:29:59,430 --> 02:30:01,900
我战斗...
I fought...

1489
02:30:05,110 --> 02:30:07,040
是因为仇恨...
out of revenge...

1490
02:30:09,980 --> 02:30:11,910
和绝望
and despair.

1491
02:30:19,090 --> 02:30:21,950
是我...
