我叫多萝塔  我是裘瑞克的妹妹
My name's Dorota, I am Jurek's sister.

6
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:04,910
您流血了
You're bleeding!

7
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,640
没关系
It's nothing.

8
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,040
走吧  多萝塔
Come Dorota

9
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,650
过些时日你大可写爱慕信给他  但现在时机不对
You can write him a fan letter later.This isn't the best time. Come on.

10
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,080
裘瑞克  你过去都把她藏在哪里的
Jurek, where have you been hiding her?

11
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,990
-我不知道要带什么  -你老是带太多东西
- I don't know what to take. - You always take too much.

12
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,060
你要带几只提箱
How many suitcases are you taking?

13
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,400
你觉得呢  我要带上西蒙叔父的肖像画吗
What do you think, should I take uncle Szymon's portrait?

14
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,130
带不带随便你  你自己决定
Take it, don't take it,take what you like.

15
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,260
你不知道我急出病来了吗
Can't you see I'm worried sick?

16
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,970
他就要回家了 他会没事的
He'll come home, he'll be alright.

17
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,270
你有另一只和这个一样的箱子
You should have another case just...

18
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,140
妈妈  瓦列迪克回家了
Mama, Wladek is home!

19
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,250
感谢老天  瓦列迪克
Thank God. Wladek!

20
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,750
-你受伤了吗  -一点小伤  不要紧的
- You're wounded? - No, it was nothing.

21
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:47,910
我都忧虑成疾了
I've been worried sick.

22
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,520
我告诉过她不用担心  你要随身带着证件
I told her not to worry.You had your papers on you.

23
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,250
如果你被炸到的话  他们就晓得该把你送到那儿去
If you'd been hit by a bomb,they'd know where to take you.

24
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:58,160
亨瑞  别...别说那种话  愿上帝宽恕你
Henryk, don't say things like that.God forbid. God forbid.

25
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,530
爸爸  瓦列迪克回来了
Papa, Wladek is home.

26
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,000
我怎么跟你说的  你在做什么
What did I tell you? What are you doing?

27
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,530
有谁看见我的宽边帽
Is anybody see my hat with the wide brim?

28
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,340
他们在进行轰炸  广播关闭了
They've bombed us. We're off the air.

29
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,630
华沙不是唯一的广播站
Warsaw is not the only radio station.

30
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,910
收拾行李  亲爱的  把你的东西打包好
Pack, darling.Get your things packed.

31
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,870
我们要到哪里去
Where are we going?

32
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,140
-离开华沙  -离开华沙去哪里
- Out of Warsaw. - Out of Warsaw where?

33
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,870
你没听说吗
You haven't heard?

34
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,640
听说什么
Heard what?

35
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,650
你没看见报纸吗
Haven't you seen the paper?

36
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,740
没有
No

37
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:19,650
报纸在哪里
Where's the paper?

38
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,410
我拿来包东西了
I used it for packing.

39
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,120
-她把报纸拿来包东西  -政府已经迁到陆柏林了
- She used it for packing. - The government has moved to Lublin.

40
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,120
所以四肢健全的男人都必须离开这座城市
22All able-body men must leave the city, go across the river,

41
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,490
为了建立一道新的防御线
set up a new line of defense.

42
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,430
除了女人  没人还留在这栋房子里
There isn't anybody left to the building, only the women.

43
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,430
男人都已经离开了
The men have gone.

44
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,800
其他人去建立新防御线  你打算做什么
What do you think you'll do while they set up a new line of defense?

45
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,670
拖着你的箱子到处游荡吗
Wonder around with your suitcases?

46
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,230
收拾一下  瓦列  没时间了
Pack, Wladek. There's no time.

47
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,670
我哪儿都不去
I'm not going anywhere.

48
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,400
很好  我也不要离开
Good. I'm not going anywhere either.

49
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,880
不要胡闹了  我们必需在一起
Don't be ridiculous,we've got to keep together.

50
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,671
听着  如果要死的话  
Look. If I'm going to die, 

51
00:03:47,672 --> 00:03:49,610
我宁愿死在自己家里  我不走
I prefer to die in my own home, staying put.

52
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,510
上帝宽恕你
God forbid.

53
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,020
别吵了  电台有重要消息  听
Shut up, I've got something. Listen.

54
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,620
据BBC报导
...from the BBC in London.

55
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:01,160
英国政府尚未得到任何...
The British government having received no reply...

56
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,200
对德国政府发出的最后通牒的回复
to the observations presented to the German government...

57
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,820
正式向纳粹德国宣战
has declared war on nazi Germany.

58
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,230
-太棒了 太棒了  -预计...
- That's wonderful! Wonderful! - It is expected that...

59
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,110
...在数小时内
...within the next few hours,

60
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,410
法国将发布同样的声明
France will make a similar declaration.

61
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,010
波兰将不再孤立无援
Poland is no longer alone.

62
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,150
太棒了  太棒了
Wonderful, wonderful!

63
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,930
妈妈  这真是一顿美妙的晚餐
Mama, that was a great dinner.

64
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,000
没错
It certainly was.

65
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,330
每当有值得庆贺的事情  你需在饭菜上花心思
When there's something to celebrate,you've got to make an effort.

66
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,700
为大不列颠和法国举杯
Here's to Great Britain and France!

67
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,170
我就说吧
I told you? Didn't I tell you?

68
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,110
一切都会没事
All will be well.

69
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,840
5,003块
Five thousand and three.

70
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,540
全部就这些吗
Is that all?

71
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,310
没错
Yes.

72
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,028
5,003波币 我们就剩下这些了 Five thousand and three zlotys, all we've got left 

73
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:32,890
我们还超出3,003元It's 3,003 zlotys too much.

74
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:37,420
你看  最新流动资产限额条例
Look."Further restrictions regarding liquid assets.

75
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,430
犹太人在家中放置现金上限为2,000波币
Jews will be allowed to keep a maximum of 2,000 zlotys at home. "

76
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,150
其余的钱该怎么处理呢
What do we do with the rest?

77
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,590
把它存进银行里  帐户会被冻结
Deposit it in a bank. a blocked account.

78
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,630
银行  谁会笨到把钱存进德国人的银行里
Banks! Who'd be stupid enough to deposit money in a German bank?

79
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,460
我们可以把钱藏起来
We could hide the money. 

80
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,700
看这里  我们可以把钱藏在花盆下面
Look here.We can hide the money under the flowerpots.

81
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,900
不  我们要采取通过通过实践考验的办法
no no no, I'll tell you what we'll do.We'll use tried and tested methods.

82
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,670
知道我们上一次是怎么做的吗
You know what we did in the last war?

83
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,440
我们在桌脚凿了个洞  把钱藏进去
We made a hole in the table leg,and hid the money in there.

84
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,810
但如果他们把桌子扛走呢
and suppose they take the table away?

85
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,210
把桌子扛走是什么意思
What do you mean take the table away?

86
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,850
德国人会闯进犹太人家里夺取任何他们想要的东西
the Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take anything they want

87
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,050
家俱  值钱的物品  任何东西 
furniture, valuables, anything.

88
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:12,620
会吗
Do they?

89
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,630
笨蛋  他们怎可能会要这样一张桌子
idiot, Why'd they want to take a table like this?

90
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,530
你到底在干什么
What on earth are you doing?

91
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,430
听着
Listen. Look.

92
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,211
这是最理想的地方 
This is the best place for it. 

93
00:06:21,212 --> 00:06:23,400
没有人会想到要搜查花盆
No-one would think of looking under the flowerpot.

94
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,770
不  不  听我说  我已经想过了
No, listen. I've been thinking...

95
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,960
-是吗  这想法倒与众不同  -我们该怎么做
- Really? That's a change. - You know what we do?

96
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:28,940
我们要运用心理学
We use psychology.

97
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,410
运用什么
We use what?

98
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,070
我们把钱和表放在桌上
We leave the money and the watch on the table, 

99
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,410
然后像这样把它们遮住
and we cover them like this. In full view.

100
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:38,970
你是傻瓜吗
Are you stupid?

101
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,227
德国人会到处搜索别的地方 
The Germans will search high and low and

102
00:06:40,228 --> 00:06:41,250
我保证他们不会发现这个
 I promised that they never notice it.

103
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,190
这是我见过最愚蠢的事情
That's the stupidest thing I've ever seen.

104
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,850
他们当然会发现  瞧着
Of course they'll notice. Look.Look here.

105
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,250
傻瓜
Idiot.

106
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,590
你说我是傻瓜
And you call me stupid.

107
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,030
那方法很好  那是最不容易被...
that's very good. because that's the last place...

108
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,330
这得花多长时间把钱塞进去啊
This would take hours.

109
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,400
-我们又不赶时间  -那用不了多久
- We're not in a hurry. - It won't take hours.

110
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,700
告诉我  那你要怎么把钱拿出来
How will you get them out? Tell me that

111
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,640
-一张张扯出来吗  -听我说
- You reach them out individually. - No-one listens to me!

112
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,410
安静  拜托有点秩序
Quiet, order, order, please

113
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,240
她是律师 她喜欢秩序
The lawyer, she likes order.

114
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,610
听我说
Listen, just listen.

115
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,680
我们把表放在花盆下  然后把钱塞进小提琴里
Look.The watch we put under the flowerpot and the money we stuff in the violin.

116
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,290
这样我还能弹奏吗
But I'll still be able to play?

117
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,420
放心  会有办法的
You'll find out.

118
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,830
裘瑞克  我是瓦列·席皮尔曼
Jurek? It's Wladek Szpilman.

119
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,490
你好吗
Wladek, how are you?

120
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,260
我们很好  谢谢  你呢
fine, We're fine, thank you.And you?

121
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,030
在这种局势下还算不错
Fine, under the circumstances.

122
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:37,300
我知道你为什么打电话  我们实在无能为力
I guess I know why you're calling. There's nothing we can do...

123
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,930
电台不会恢复
They won't reopen the station.

124
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,740
是的 我知道 但是裘瑞克...
Yes, I know, but I...

125
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,580
没有音乐  没有波兰人听的广播  什么都没有  
No music, nothing,no radios for the Polish.

126
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,310
但我确信像你这样的钢琴家
But sure you'll find work.

127
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,580
会找到工作的
A pianist like you.

128
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,620
或许吧  但是...
Maybe, maybe not, but...

129
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,590
听着  我无意冒犯
listen,don't be offended,but I...

130
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,220
但我打电话来不是为了讨论我以后的工作
didn't call to discuss my future carrier.

131
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,720
我对裘瑞克唠叨了好几个礼拜
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks,

132
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,193
最后他投降了  说  
and at last he gave in and said...

133
00:07:59,194 --> 00:08:00,890
"好吧 明天和我一起去电台"
"All right, come with me tomorrow",

134
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:05,130
于是我来了  但他们把电台炸毁了
so I came and...they bombed the station.

135
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,040
能与你那样认识很不错

139
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,910
没有人能像你这样演奏萧邦的曲目
No-one plays Chopin like you.

140
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,610
我希望那是个赞美
I hope it's a compliment.

141

我当然是这个意思
Of course, I mean it.

142
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,960
我只是...开个玩笑
I was... trying to be funny.

143
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,220
愿意跟我去帕拉迪索喝杯咖啡吗
Should we go Pradiso and have a coffee?

144
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,520
乐意之至

145
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,230
你呢  你是做什么的
And you, what do you do?

146
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,260
我刚从音乐学校毕业
I finished with the conservatoire.

147
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,090
你是乐师
You're a musician?

148
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:34,860
是的  只是...
Yes. But only just...

大提琴
The cello.

151
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,200
我喜欢看女士演奏大提琴
I love to see women playing the cello.

152
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,430
禁止犹太人进入
JEWS FORBIDDEN

153
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,670
真是无礼  他们怎能这样
This is disgraceful.How dare they?

154
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,580
人就是这样  他们比希特勒还希特勒
You know what people are like, they want to be better nazis than Hitler.

155
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,980
-我要去抗议  -算了
- I'm going in there to complain. - No

156
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,880
最好不要  相信我
It's better not, believe me.

157
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,580
这对你来说太屈辱了
It's so humiliating. Someone like you!

158
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,300
我们去别处吧

159
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,870
我们可以到公园散步
We can walk in the park.

No, we can't.Official decree.No Jews allowed in the park.

161
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,410
天啊  你是开玩笑吗
My God. Are you joking?

162
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,740
我没有开玩笑  是真的
I'm not joking, it's true.

163
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,780
我想我们可以坐在长椅上
I suggest we could sit in a bench,

164
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,310
但官方另有禁令 "犹太人禁止坐在公共长椅上"
but another official decree "no Jews allowed on public benches".

165
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,750
这真是荒谬
This is absurd.

166
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,340
我告诉你我们可以做什么吧  我们只能站在这里交谈
I tell what we can do,We can just stand here and talk.

167
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:31,320
我想这是被允许的  不是吗
and I think we're allowed to do that, don't you?

168
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,980
那么你拉大提琴的  多萝塔  好极了
So, you play the cello. Dorota, That's nice.

169
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,530
你最欣赏的作曲家是谁
And who's your favorite composer?

170
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,650
萧邦  是吗
Chopin? Really? Well...

171
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,930
你得学他的大提琴奏鸣曲  不是吗
you'll have to learn to play his cello sonata, won't you?

172
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,060
那么你呢  瓦列

底布必需要够大

193
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,480

就卖出一本杜思妥也夫斯基的"白痴"
just one,Dostoyevsky's "Idiot"

271
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,670
3元波币
3 zlotys.

272
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,130
不过比昨天好
Better than yesterday.

273
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,330
3枚肮脏的波币
Three lousy zlotys. 

274
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,630
但有人却大把大把的赚钞票
And there are people there making millions.

275
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,330
我知道
I know.

276
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,210
你才不知道呢
You don't know, believe me.

277
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:42,910
他们贿赂警卫  警卫于是睁一只眼闭一只眼
They bribe the guards,the guards turn a blind eye.

278
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:47,950
他们大量输入食物 烟酒  法国化妆品
They bring cartloads of food,tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics.

279
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,320
穷人在他们周围死去  他们连痰也没啐一口
And the poor are dying all around and they don't give a damn.

280
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,450
不好意思  请问你看见我丈夫伊沙克 沙曼了吗
Excuse me, have you seen my husband, Izaak Szerman?

281
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,620
一个高大英俊的男人  他蓄着灰色的胡子
A tall handsome man,with a little gray beard.

282
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,360

283
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,260
打扰了
Excuse me.

284
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:04,430
再见  祝好梦

But if you see him, write to me, yes?

286
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,670
伊沙克·沙曼
Izaak Szerman.

287
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:27,920
为什么非得要有一条非犹太人的街道穿过我们的地方
Why do we have to have a gentile street running through our area?

288
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,890
为什么他们不绕过去
Why can't they go around?

289
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:34,630
别担心  他们就要建一座桥了  你没听说吗
Don't worry about it. They're about to build a bridge. Haven't you heard?

290
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:37,460
一座桥?  一个笑话
A bridge! A bridge!Those idiots.

291
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,570
德国人声称他们智商高
The Germans claim to be intelligent.

292
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,440
你知道我怎么想吗  他们根本是不折不扣的白痴
But do you know what I think?I think they're totally stupid.

293
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,480
我有家人要养
I have a family to feed.

294
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:50,670
却得在这里花上半辈子时间等他们放行
I spend half of my time here...waiting for them to let us through.

295
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,940
他们以为我来这里干嘛  来听音乐的吗
Maybe they think I come here to listen to the music?

296
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:58,870
-说什么呢  你很急?  -你有意见?

297
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,190
-找点乐子  -对  跳舞

你去跟他一起跳

302
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:22,430
闪开  空出地方让这些犹太佬跳舞

303
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,020

316
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,500
你来这干什么
So, what are you doing here?

317
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:50,030
他带饼干来
He brought cakes, he is up

318
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,970
他爸爸做珠宝生意回来  他干得不错  是吧
His father is back in the jewellery business,doing well him.eh?

谁在招人

323
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,450
全国各地的犹太人涌进城市

324
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,248
很快隔离区会有50万人  
Soon there will be half million people in the ghetto.

325
00:21:09,249 --> 00:21:10,780
我们需要更多的犹太人警察

更多的犹太人警察

you mean you want me to beat up Jews in my truncheon and catch the Gestapo

328

00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,030
我以为你只征召富家子弟
I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers.

331
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,230
看看我父亲 看看我们  我的意思是...

对犹太人动刀?

397
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,610
他们让波兰人为犹太人开刀?
They let a Pole to come in to operate on a Jew?

398
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:13,240

He got a pass, that's all I know. Anyway, so...

他让病人昏睡过去然后开始动手术
he puts the patient to sleep and starts the operation.

400

他才刚划下第一刀  SS部队就闯进来
He'd just made the first incision when the SS burst in...

401
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:21,760

403
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,020
这是不是很好笑
Isn't that a laugh?

404

然后他们要关闭这个小犹太区

我不知道你在处理许可证的业务

537
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,580

00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,720
你的背怎样了
How's your back?

546
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,980
好多了
Better.

547
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,180
好多了吗
Better?

548
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,320
已经好多了
Better than ask

549
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:43,430
谢谢你
Thank you.

550
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,570
不客气  虽然我什么忙也帮不上
My pleasure. Won't help you anyway.

551
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:51,410
谢谢你  修兹先生
Thank you, Mr. Schultz.

552
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:07,430
1942年3月15日

553
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:06,420
至少我们在犹太区找到工作了
At least we got work in the ghetto.

554
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:09,020
至少我们都还在一起
At least we are still together.

555
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,740
全部出去

556
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,430
到院子去

557
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:28,990
别站着不动

558
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:31,140
我们都是雇员

559
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,580
我们有工作证

560
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,880
等等
Wait.

561
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,630
给你
Here.

562
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,050
去那里  快点

563
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,100
你

564
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:49,530
你  你

565
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,200
你

566
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,470
你

567
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,270
你

568
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,960
其余的人穿好衣服回到这里

569
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:16,060
带着你们的东西  最多15公斤

570
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:19,220
您要把我们送去哪里

571
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,450
抱歉  我已经尽力了
I'm sorry, I did my best.

572
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,460
我以为工作证可以拯救我们
I thought the certificates'd save us.

573
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,650
别说了  瓦列
Stop it, Wladek.

574
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,320
就让我们一心期望亨瑞和哈琳娜安然无恙
Let's just hope that Henryk and Halina will be better off.

575
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,890
1942年8月16日

576
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,260
我们要到哪里去
Where will we be going?

577
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,520
你们要去工作
Going to work.

578
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,890
你们会比待在那个臭气熏天的犹太区好多了  向前走
You'll be much better off than in the stinking ghetto. Move.

579
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,010
我怎能这样做
Why did I do it?

580
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,360
我怎能这样做
Why did I do it?

581
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,070
我怎能这样做
Why did I do it?

582
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,610
我怎能这样做
Why did I do it?

583
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,240
我怎能这样做
Why did I do it?

584
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,920
我怎能这样做
Why did I do it?

585
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:57,820
我怎能这样做  我怎能这样做
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

586
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,720
我怎能这样做
Why did I do it?

587
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:05,960
我怎能这样做
Why did I do it?

588
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,800
你有水吗
Don't you have a bottle of water?

589
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:36,730
他快死了  我的孩子快要渴死了
He's dying.My child is dying of thirst.

590
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:38,700
-我求求你  求求你  -我很抱歉  
- I beg you.I beg you. - I'm sorry.

591
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,600
你有水吗  求求你
Don't you have a bottle of water? I beg you.

592
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:42,830
你听到我说的话吗
Did you hear what I'm saying?

593
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:44,500
我告诉你  这是一个耻辱
I'm telling you, it's a disgrace.

594
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,200
我在听
I can hear you.

595
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,710
我们任凭他们把我们引向死亡  就像羔羊走向屠场
Letting them take us to our death like sheep to the slaughter.

596
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:48,710
别这么大声
Not so loud.

597
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:50,070
我们何不反击
Why don't we attack them?

598
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:53,510
我们有五十万人在这里  我们可以突破犹太区重围
There's half a million of us here. We can break out of the ghetto.

599
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:54,979
至少我们可以光荣地死去 
At least we can die honorably, 

600
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,420
而不是当历史上的一个污点
not as a stain on the face of History.

601
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:57,450
为何你这么确定
Why are you so sure 

602
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:58,620
他们会送我们下黄泉
they're sending us to our death?

603
00:43:58,690 --> 00:43:59,620
我不确定
I'm not sure

604
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,660
你知道为什么我不能确定吗
You know why I'm not sure?

605
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:02,820
他们又没告诉我
Because they didn't tell me.

606
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,708
他们要把我们赶尽杀绝  They're going to wipe us all out. 

607
00:44:04,709 --> 00:44:06,860
你希望我怎么做  你要我抗争吗Tell me what do you want me to do? Do you want me to fight?

608
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,130
抗争的话需要组织  计划  枪支...
To fight, we need organization, plans, guns.

609
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:10,460
他说得没错  你认为我能做什么
He's right. Do you think I'm going

610
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:12,230
用我的小提琴弓抗争吗
to fight with my violin bowl?

611
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:15,740
德国人不会浪费像这样庞大的劳力
The Germans would never squander a huge labor force like this.

612
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:17,740
很明显地他们正要把我们送到集中营
They're sending us to a labor camp,

613
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,540
喔 当然  看看那个瘸子
oh,Sure. Look at that cripple there,

614
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:24,040
看看这些老人跟小孩  他们也要工作吗
the old people, the children. They're going to work?

615
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:27,840
看看你  你要带着背上的铁架一起去吗
Look at you. You're going to carry logs on your back?

616
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:11,430
亨瑞
Henryk!

617
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,260
哈莲娜  亨瑞
Halina, Henryk!

618
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,390
哈莲娜  亨瑞
Halina, Henryk!

619
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:25,070
我们听说你们在这里

620
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:27,640
我们要跟你们在一起
I wanted to be with you!

621
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,150
我们要跟你们在一起
I wanted to be with you!

622
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:41,320
笨蛋  笨蛋
Stupid. Stupid.

623
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:46,060
我怎能这样做  我怎能这样做
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

624
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,690
她让我神经紧张
She's getting on my nerves.

625
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,930
老天爷  她到底做了什么
What did she do, for God's sake?

626
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:57,730
她闷死了她的婴儿
She smothered her baby.

627
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:04,110
他们准备了一个隐匿处  他们都躲在那里
They prepared a hiding place and of course they went there.

628
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:06,980
但是当警察来的时候  婴儿哭了起来
The baby cried just as the police came.

629
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,810
她用手捂住啼哭的婴儿
She smothered the cries with her hands, 

630
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:11,790
婴儿就这么死了
the baby died.

631
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,180
有个警察听见了声响
A policeman heard the death rattle

632
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:16,350
发现他们的藏身之处
and found where they were hiding.

633
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:32,340
妈妈
mama

634
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,680
你在读什么
What are you reading?

635
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,420
若你戳刺我们  我们不会流血吗
"If you prick us, de we not bleed?

636
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:50,590
若你呵我们痒  我们不会发笑吗
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

637
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,260
若你对我们下毒  我们不会死去吗
If you poison us, do we not die?

638
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,300
若你加害于我们  我们不应该复仇吗
And, if you wrong us,shall we not revenge?"

639
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,900
写得很好
Very appropriate.

640
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,600
是啊  这就是我带着它的原因
Yes. That's why I brought it.

641
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,630
那个傻瓜  他觉得在这儿赚钱还有用吗
Idiot. What does he think he's gonna do with the money?

642
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:31,530
嘿  男孩
Boy,

643
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:32,900
来这里
come here.

644
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:35,190
来这里
Come here.

645
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:38,230
一块奶糖要多少钱
How much for a caramel?

646
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:39,670
20波币
20 zlotys.

647
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:41,000
什么  一块奶糖要要这么多
What? For one caramel?

648
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,740
你想要怎么花这些钱
What do you think you're gonna do with the money?

649
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,610
20波币
20 zlotys.

650
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,250
我们谁有20波币吗
We've got 20 between us.

651
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:50,580
我想我有10元
I've got 10, I think.

652
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:56,960
5  10  20
5, 10, 20.

653
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:21,780
-哈琳娜  -什么
- Halina? - What?

654
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:26,590
现在说这个挺怪的  但是...
It's a funny time to say this, but...

655
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:27,790
什么
What?

656
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,330
但愿我能多了解你一些
I wish I knew you better.

657
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,830
谢谢
Thank you.

658
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:55,080
席皮尔曼
Szpilman

659
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:56,920
席皮尔曼
Szpilman

660
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:04,760
滚开  笨蛋  走

661
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,590
爸爸  爸爸
Papa? Papa?

662
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,430
爸爸
papa

663
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:11,700
妈妈  哈琳娜
Mama? Halina?

664
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,900
哈琳娜  妈妈
Halina? Mama?

665
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,770
你以为自己在干嘛  席皮尔曼
What do you think you're doing,Szpilman?

666
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:18,810
我救了你一命
I saved your life.

667
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:21,380
起来  快走  走
Just get up,go! Go!

668
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,090
别用跑的
Don't run!

669
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:33,920
安娜  安娜  安娜
Anna!Anna!Anna!

670
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:56,340
好  把他们送去彻底改造

671
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,470
是的

672
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:04,040
这个留下  把它给我

673
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,590
你在干什么  她是孕妇
What are you doing? She's pregnant.

674
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,070
向左转

675
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:56,770
齐步走

676
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,510
瓦列
Wladek?

677
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:01,030
你怎么会在这里  瓦列
Why are you here, Wladek?

678
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:05,170
就是这样  我  我
It's like this, I...

679
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,100
我们...
We...

680
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,710
他们所有人  他们所有人
All of them, all of them.

681
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,850
他们所有人
All of them.

682
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:20,480
也许他们够幸运  早登极乐
Perhaps they're lucky. The quicker, the better.

683
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:24,850
现在还没有结束  我们将在这里待上些日子
It's not finished yet. We'll stay here for a couple of days...

684
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:27,020
直到尘埃落定
until things die down.

685
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:30,620
我已经贿赂了一个警察  事情结束的时候他会过来
I've bribed the policeman, he'll come when it's over.

686
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,630
立正  前进

687
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,600
跟上

688
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,950
天呐  我已经有二年没有出去过了
My God, I haven't been outside in, it must be two years.

689
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:55,820
真激动
Don't get overexcited.

690
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:14,300
黄金

有认识的人吗
Someone you know?

693
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:41,530
这个美人是谁
A beauty. Who is she?

00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:44,530
她是个歌手  事实上我跟她很熟

695
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:46,200
她丈夫是演员

696
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,830
他们都是好人
They're good people.

697
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:48,770
我想跟她说话
I'd like to talk to her.

698
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:52,180
别忘记  支援犹太人的都被绞死了
Don't forget, Wladek.They hang them for helping Jews.

699
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:21,950
向左转

700
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:24,610
前进

701
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:31,580
立正

702
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,520
向右转

703
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:58,610
出列

704
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:00,730
你

705
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:05,570
你

706
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,120
你

707
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,160
趴下

708
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:17,500
趴下

709
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:46,910
向右转

710
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:50,530
前进

711
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:31,870
你在这里待多久了
How long have you been here?

712
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,570
昨晚开始的
Since last night.

713
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:37,570
很高兴遇见你
I was pleased to see you.

714
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:44,410
他们现在即将开始进行最后的安置
They're going to start the final resettlement now.

715
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:49,050
我们知道那意味着什么
We know what it means.

716
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:54,730
我们送了一个人出去  席格蒙  他是个好人
We sent someone out. Zygmund, a good man.

717
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,660
他受命追踪从华沙发出的列车
His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw.

718
00:59:02,570 --> 00:59:03,700
他抵达索克洛

719
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:07,310
一位当地的铁道员告诉他  轨道在那里分歧了
A man told him the tracks divided,

720
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:09,270
一条通往催布林卡

721
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:15,410
他说每天运货列车载着满车的人从华沙驶来
He said everyday freight trains carrying people from Warsaw...

722
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:18,680

branch off to Treblinka and return empty.

723
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:21,850
在那条路线上  从没看过有食物运送
No transports of food are ever seen on that line.

724
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:27,050
而居民...被禁止靠近催布林卡车站
The civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station.

725
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:32,430
他们想把我们赶尽杀绝
They're exterminating us.

726
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,930
那用不着花太多时间
It won't take them long.

727
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,010
从50万人到现在  我们只剩下6万人

728
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:47,010
几乎都是年轻人

729
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:51,020
而这一次我们要反抗
And this time we're gonna fight.

730
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:58,160
我们状况良好  组织健全

我们已经准备好了

732
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:02,900
如果你需要援助  我...

抱歉  我很抱歉

736
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:43,160
我...我刚刚失了神
I don't know what I was thinking.

737
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:49,830
不  拜托  不要  拜托
please, please

738
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,000
拜托
please

739
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
把他拖走

740
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:33,490
我希望你弹钢琴的功夫比砌砖好
I hope you play the piano better than you carry bricks.

741
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,420
他不会撑太久的  如果他继续这样下去
He won't last long if he goes on like this.

742
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:41,550
我看看我是否能让他好过一点
I'll see if I can get him something better.

743
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:05,650
有麻烦
Trouble.

744
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:12,320
集合  只有犹太人
Round up! Only the Jews.

745
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:15,620
波兰人继续干活  犹太人集合
The Polish keep working. Only the Jews.

746
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:25,100
我有好消息要告诉你们

747
01:02:26,070 --> 01:02:28,670
到处都有谣言...
There are rumors going around that

748
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:32,630
我们就要  呃...

749
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:34,510
安置你们
to resettle you.

750
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:41,320
我保证  从今以后
I promise you that now and in the future...

751
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:43,890
再也没有新计划
nothing else is planned.

752
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:48,860
基于这个原因
For this reason,

753
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,660
我们要在墙上贴公报
we put information posters on the wall.

754
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:57,200
为了表示我们的善意
To show you our goodwill...

755
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,640
应该推举你们当中某一个人...
you should vote one of you to be allowed...

756
01:02:59,770 --> 01:03:04,710
他获准每天进城...

757
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:11,250
带回三公斤的马铃薯...

758
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:13,620
还有一条面包...

759
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:15,720
给你们每一个工人
for each of your workers.

760
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:19,590
如果我们要把你们怎么样的话
So, why should we do something like this

761
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:22,590
我们为何还要这样做呢
if we'd resettle you?

762
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:25,190
你们可以好好做生意...
You can make good business

763
01:03:25,330 --> 01:03:29,130
不做这一行  你们会没饭吃
out of the things you don't eat.

764
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:33,230
这不是是你们犹太人最擅长的吗
Isn't that something that you Jews are good in?

765
01:03:33,370 --> 01:03:35,100
赚钱
Making money?

766
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:40,410
回去工作

767
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:58,690
那个...是用绳子绑的

其它的用铁线绑

我想要离开这里
I want to get out of here.

773
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:02,150
要出去很容易
It's easy to get out. 

774
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,020
困难的是你要如何在外面存活下来
It's how you survive on the other side,that's hard.

775
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:08,030

776

去年夏天
Last summer,I worked for a day

777
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:12,360
我曾在兹兰那 布拉马广场工作了一天
in the Zelazna Brama Square.

778
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:15,870
我看见一个认识的人  她是个老朋友了

一位歌手  她丈夫是个演员
A singer, her husband is an actor.

780
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:23,440
我写下他们的名字跟地址
I've filled their names down and their address, 

781
01:06:23,610 --> 01:06:25,200
如果他们还住在原处的话
if they're still there.

782
01:06:25,350 --> 01:06:28,210
嘉琳娜·果朵瓦丝卡和安德兹·博克基
Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki.

783
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:30,410
他们都是好人
They're good people.

784
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,050
你能试着连络上他们吗
Would you try to make contact?

785
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:38,450
你每天都进城  你能问问他们...

786
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:41,320
问他们是否能帮我逃离这里
Ask them if they'd help me get out of here.

787
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:16,190
有药膏吗

788
01:07:25,970 --> 01:07:28,070
你上来做什么

789
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:32,570
里面是什么

790
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:36,880
我们获准把食物带进犹太区

791
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:40,180
3公斤的马铃薯和面包

792
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:41,850
打开

793
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:48,320
马铃薯和面包

794
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:51,520
你在说谎  我嗅到你的谎言了

795
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:55,260
打开

796
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:25,090
马铃薯?

797
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:32,000
你们犹太人都一样

798
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:33,870
你们犹太人...

799
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:35,800
...总是

800
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:38,570
得寸进尺

801
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:55,050
下次再骗我  我就把你给毙了

802
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,590
我以名义起誓

803
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:22,850
我试着去找你的朋友

他们没有住在那里了

805
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:26,230
那...你联络到了吗

我们要去哪儿

811
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:51,650
我教你们什么叫纪律  犹太猪

812
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:59,120
知道为什么要扁你们吗

813
01:09:59,260 --> 01:09:59,880
-不  -知道为什么要扁你们吗

814
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:03,690
为什么

815
01:10:03,830 --> 01:10:06,030
为了庆祝耶诞夜

816
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:11,840
现在  前进

817
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:14,500
前进  把歌唱起来

818
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:16,600
唱点让人振奋的歌

819
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:20,410
大声地唱  整齐地唱

820
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:21,680
走

821
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:40,410
对不起  我脏兮兮的
I'm sorry.I'm dirty. I'm so filthy.

822
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:07,940
我们没有太多时间  来吧

823
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:17,650
我们得快一点

824
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:20,450
这里  看看合不合身
Here. See if this fit.

825
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:22,790
我们得一直换地方
We have to keep moving

826
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:25,400
德国人现在不分青红皂白地搜捕
Germans are hunting down indiscriminately now.

827
01:13:25,530 --> 01:13:28,500
犹太人  非犹太人  任何人  每一个人
Jews, non-Jews, anybody, everybody.

828
01:13:28,970 --> 01:13:31,270
瓦列  你最好刮一下胡子
Wladek,You better shave.

829
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:32,930
用我架子上的刮胡刀
Use my razor on the shelf.

830
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:50,080
马里克 吉勃克辛斯基会照顾你的
You'll be looked after by Gebczynski.

831
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:52,220
他住在城的另一边
He's on the other side of town.

832
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:55,760
今晚你就待在那里  我们会再帮你找新的住处
You stay there tonight, then we'll find you somewhere else.

833
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,120

834
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:01,160
好吧  我们走了

835
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:43,070
我会告诉你要睡在哪里
I'll show you where you're going to sleep.

836
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:17,240
你必需在这边待到明天下午
You have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.

837
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:21,040
我们在犹太区围墙附近为你准备了公寓
We have a flat for you near the ghetto wall.

838
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:22,340
不过那里很安全
But it's safe.

839
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,360
这里不太舒适
It's not going to be very comfortable.

840
01:15:32,930 --> 01:15:34,260
已经很好了
I'll be fine.

841
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:45,830
谢谢你

我来拿  给我

845
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:02,610
我现在要拉下窗帘

846
01:17:09,190 --> 01:17:11,050
但你整个白天要任由它们敞开着 
But you leave them open during the day.

847
01:17:11,190 --> 01:17:12,560
不要忘记 
Don't forget.

848
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:18,460
在墙的这一边一定会好过些吧
Must feel better on this side of the wall,eh?

849
01:17:19,270 --> 01:17:20,560
是 
Yes.

850
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:25,570
但有时候我仍不确定自己是在墙的哪一边 
But sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.

851
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:31,700
这儿有些面包... 马铃薯 洋葱

我会再来的

855

01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:44,520
这个非常重要

857
01:17:45,390 --> 01:17:48,190
如果万一发生紧急状况... 我是说非常紧急...

到这个地址去

859
01:18:33,770 --> 01:18:36,070
混蛋  你说忘记是什么意思

860
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:37,900
你认为我是什么意思
What do you think I mean?

861
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:39,340
我的意思就是我忘记了 
I forgot,that's what I mean.

862
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:41,610
你待我如粪土 .
You know what,you treat me like dirt.

863
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:44,810
我待你如粪土  因为你就是粪土 
Treat you like dirt? Because you are a dirt.

864
01:18:44,950 --> 01:18:47,110

867
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,890
你弹琴时像个天使 
Um,you play like an angel,catskin.

868
01:19:00,030 --> 01:19:02,520
如果我弹琴像个天使  你为什么不听 
If i look like an angel,why don't you listen?

869
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:03,930
我有听啊  小喵咪 
I'm listening.

870
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:06,600
骗子  你明明睡着了  小猪头 
Liar.You fell asleep. Pig.

01:19:29,790 --> 01:19:33,840
散开  我们遭到袭击了

873
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:38,760
藏起来

874
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:41,430

转过去

882
01:21:54,170 --> 01:21:55,900

没人想到会他们会坚持这么久 
No one thought they'd hold out so long.

886

我不应该出来的

我应该留在那里  与他们一起战斗

我...我想...我得了黄疸

1009

它只是让你看起来比较好笑

我必需筹钱买食物

1025
01:40:23,180 --> 01:40:24,510
随时都可能到

-我要去找医生  -你不能去  这样太危险了 
- I'll get a doctor - You can't. It's too dangerous.

1031
01:41:28,110 --> 01:41:29,810
我去找路札克医生  我们可以信任他 
Dr. Luczak. We can trust him.

1032
01:41:29,950 --> 01:41:32,040
多萝塔  别傻了  他是儿科医生

他也是医生

不  你留下  我去找

1035
01:42:11,190 --> 01:42:12,680
我们是来道别的 
We came to say goodbye.

1036
01:42:14,290 --> 01:42:17,230
我们要到奥特沃茨克跟我妈妈在一起 
We're going to stay with my mother in Otwocks.

1037
01:42:17,430 --> 01:42:20,300
宝宝已经在那里了  那里更安全

There's talk that the uprising will begin any day now.

1039
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:28,530
札勒斯可能被射杀了 
That man Szalas should be shot.

1040
01:42:29,970 --> 01:42:34,240
他为了你在华沙到处募款 
He's been collecting money on your behalf all over Warsaw.

1041
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:37,310
显然人们慷慨解囊 
Apparently people gave generously,

1042
01:42:37,950 --> 01:42:39,940
所以他筹到了一笔可观的数目 
so he collected a tidy sum.

1043
01:42:44,150 --> 01:42:45,920
天啊

肝脏肿得像颗橄榄球 
The liver the size of a football.

1045

胆囊有严重的发炎

1046
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:57,130
但他会活着

1047
01:43:00,770 --> 01:43:02,970
我会试着给他找些果糖 
I'll try to get him some laevulose,

1048
01:43:03,110 --> 01:43:04,270
但这并不容易 
but it's not easy.

1049
01:43:05,310 --> 01:43:07,000
你可以再来看他吗
Can you visit him again?

1050
01:43:07,710 --> 01:43:08,770
我也不确定
Who knows.

1051
01:43:08,910 --> 01:43:09,740

1052

1056

然后我们就得走了

1057
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:35,570
1944年8月1日

1058
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:21,910
那里有个受伤的人

1059
01:44:22,410 --> 01:44:24,950

01:44:40,090 --> 01:44:42,720

1064
01:46:29,850 --> 01:46:31,640
出去

Somebody...Somebody help me!

1069
01:48:21,730 --> 01:48:24,900

01:53:10,310 --> 01:53:12,520
扔过去

1077
01:54:36,770 --> 01:54:39,730
要把所有的东西都做上标记

1078
01:54:40,780 --> 01:54:41,740
快点

1079
02:01:43,030 --> 02:01:44,690

02:02:12,120 --> 02:02:14,520
我试着要把罐头打开

1086
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:17,390
你住在这里吗

1087
02:02:21,100 --> 02:02:23,120
你在这里工作吗

1088
02:02:23,270 --> 02:02:25,170
不

1089
02:02:28,670 --> 02:02:29,970
你的职业是什么

1090
02:02:33,540 --> 02:02:35,170
我...

1091
02:02:37,550 --> 02:02:39,670
我是钢琴师

1092
02:02:42,590 --> 02:02:43,950

02:08:51,990 --> 02:08:53,920
你躲在这里吗

1096
02:08:59,630 --> 02:09:00,960
犹太人?

1097
02:09:04,070 --> 02:09:05,730
你躲在哪里

1098
02:09:08,370 --> 02:09:09,500
阁楼

1099
02:09:13,640 --> 02:09:14,700
带我去看

1100
02:09:39,300 --> 02:09:40,560
你有吃的吗

1101
02:10:27,930 --> 02:10:33,520
他们说  这非常的重要...

1102
02:10:40,400 --> 02:10:41,490

早安上校

1105
02:11:52,200 --> 02:11:53,400
犹太人

1106
02:12:08,550 --> 02:12:10,380
对不起  请问...

1107
02:12:10,450 --> 02:12:12,890
那些炮火是怎么回事

1108
02:12:13,020 --> 02:12:15,460
俄国人正要渡河

1109
02:12:17,090 --> 02:12:20,220
你只需再等两个礼拜就够了

1110
02:13:51,650 --> 02:13:52,880
发生什么事了

1111
02:13:53,020 --> 02:13:54,580
我们要撤退了

1112
02:13:57,730 --> 02:13:59,420
俄国人来了吗

1113
02:13:59,560 --> 02:14:00,550
还没

1114
02:14:04,030 --> 02:14:09,230
我不知道该怎么感谢你

1115
02:14:09,410 --> 02:14:11,900
感谢上帝  不用谢我

1116
02:14:12,040 --> 02:14:14,030
他让我们死里逃生

1117
02:14:14,180 --> 02:14:17,370
这就是为什么我们要信仰他

1118
02:14:29,220 --> 02:14:30,190
给你  拿着

1119
02:14:31,930 --> 02:14:32,920

那件更暖和

1122
02:14:40,600 --> 02:14:43,130
战争结束后你要做什么

1123
02:14:45,970 --> 02:14:48,500
我会继续在波兰电台

1124
02:14:49,240 --> 02:14:50,710
弹钢琴

1125
02:14:51,280 --> 02:14:52,980
告诉我你的名字

1126
02:14:53,120 --> 02:14:54,810
也许我会来听你演奏

1127
02:14:56,050 --> 02:14:57,350
席皮尔曼

1128
02:14:58,490 --> 02:14:59,890
席皮尔曼
