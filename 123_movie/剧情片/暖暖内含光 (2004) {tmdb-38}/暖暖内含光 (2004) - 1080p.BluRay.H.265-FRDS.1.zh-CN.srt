今天是卡片公司发明的节日

19
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,650
故意让人伤心难过

搭火车去蒙托克

不知道为什么

23
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,330
我平常不会这么冲动
I'm not an impulsive person.

24
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,820
可能是早上起床心情欠佳

这里的海滩冷死人了

二月的蒙托克美极了

只是把到妹的机会渺茫
I guess my chances of that happening are somewhat diminished...

39
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,600
因为我无法正眼看陌生女子
since I'm incapable of making eye contact

40
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,730
with a woman I don't know.

41
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,600
或许我该回头找娜欧蜜

45
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,580
我怎么会见一个爱一个？
Why do I fall in love with every woman I see...

46
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,500
对我没兴趣的我也爱？

“蒙托克”

你说什么？
I'm sorry?

50
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,460
我在向你问好

可以坐近一点吗？
Okay if I sit closer?

54
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,360

洛维尔常青社
Rockville Center.

Me, too.

57
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:18,900
真的吗？
Really?

58
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,260
有多少人能殊途同归？
What are the odds?

59
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,840
你很面熟耶
Do I know you?

60
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,780
有没有在诚品买过书？
Do you ever shop at Barnes and noble?

61

有啊
Sure.

62
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,220
那就对了
That's it! I've seen you.

63
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:32,950
怎样？

64
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,720
我见过你

65
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,400
我在那里当过…

五年的廉价劳工

67
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:39,880
天哪
I would have thought I would remember you.

68
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,450
结果我认不出你 五年了吗？

69
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,870
可能是头发吧
It might be the hair.

70
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,480
怎样？
What might?

71
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,240
变得了很多
It changes a lot. The color.

72
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,850
发色吧，难怪你认不出我

这是颓废蓝

74

这样啊
The color.

75
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,480
名字很炫吧？
Snappy name, huh?

76
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,740
我喜欢 是啊
I like it.

77

这家公司生产了
This company makes a whole line of colors with snappy names.

血腥红、狂热黄、革命绿
Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution...

80
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,370
有人专门在想这些名字
That would be a job, coming up with those names.

81
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,370
有那种工作吗？
You think there could possibly be a job like that?

82
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,500
能有几种发色？
How many hair colors could there be?

融入了我多变的个性
I apply my personality in a paste.

88
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,850
我倒不以为然
I doubt that very much.

89
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,950
你不了解我
Well, you don't know me, so

90
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,380
所以你不会知道的
you don't know, do you?

91
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,220
抱歉，我只是…
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,870
我只是礼貌性回答
I was just trying to be nice.

93

别取笑我的名字

99
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,510
应该不会啦，你很有礼貌
Oh no. You wouldn't do that.

100
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,690
You're trying to be nice.

101
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,440

104
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,870
卡通啊
Huckleberry Hound?

105
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,510
你脑筋秀逗啊？
What are you, nuts?

106
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,280
你有说过
It's been suggested.

107
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,390
“亲爱的…亲爱的克蕾婷”

110
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,410

111
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,050
抱歉，只不过…
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. Really nice.

112
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,790
这个名字很好听

113
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,640
意思是“仁慈”吧？
It means merciful, right?

114
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,630
仁慈宽厚？
Clemency?

115
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,300
可惜名不副实
Although it hardly fits.

116
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,870
我是有仇必报的女人
I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.

117
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,960
天哪，看不出来耶
I wouldn't think that about you.

118
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,500
你怎么可能看出来嘛
Why wouldn't you?

119
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,790
不知道，就是…
I don't know.

120
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,000
不知道，就是…

121
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,120
你看起来人很好
You seemed nice.

122
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,380
我人很好？
now I'm nice?

123
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,270
天哪，你没别的形容词了吗？
Don't you know any other adjectives?

124
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,590
我不想当好人
I don't need to be nice.

125
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,110
没这必要，别人也不必对我好
And I don't need anybody to be nice to me.

126
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,740
好吧
Okay.

127
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,090
乔尔？
Joel?

128
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,190

It's Joel, right?

129
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,920
对
Yes.

130
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,760
很抱歉刚才对你大小声
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

131
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,430
我今天心情不好
I'm a little of out sorts today.

132
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,230
我要承认一件糗事
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice right now.

133
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,870
我喜欢你人很好

134
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,990
现在…

135
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,540
不知道下一刻我会怎么想
I can't tell from one moment to the next

136
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,330
what I'm going to like, but...

137
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,140
但现在…
right now I'm glad you are.

138
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,580
很庆幸你人很好

139
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,110
我有点事…
I have some stuff that I probably should...

140
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,580
可能要…

141
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:10,470
我正在写…
Oh! I'm sorry.

142
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:11,550
对不起
Okay. no...

143
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,790
没关系
Sure. That's okay.

144
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,490
没事，我无所谓啦

145
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,970
这碰巧是…

146
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:16,940
好吧

147
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,540
你保重
Take care, then.

148
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,340
天哪
Jesus.

149
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:34,830
嗨!

150
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,130
我可以顺道载你一程
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.

151
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,320
好冷
It's cold.

152
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,080
对，冷死人了 好吧，快上车
Yeah! Okay.

153
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,190
It is frosty.

154
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,780
你没在跟踪我吧？
You're not a stalker or anything, right?

155
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:46,830
我没有
I'm not a stalker.

156
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,520
是你先找我搭讪的，记得吗？
You're the one that talked to me, remember?

157
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,750
这是歹徒老掉牙的把戏了
That is the oldest trick in the stalker book

158
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,080
是吗？
Really? There's a stalker book?

159
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,920
歹徒还有把戏？

160
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,910
好极了

161
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,240
我倒想研究一下
I've got to read that one.

162
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,650
很抱歉我疯疯癫癫的
I'm sorry if I came off sort of nutso.

163
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,430
我平常不会这样
I'm not really.

164
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,710
没关系
That's okay. I didn't think you were.

165
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,490
我不觉得你疯疯癫癫

166
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,210
要不要喝一杯？
Do you want to have a drink?

167
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,380
我有很多酒可以…
I have lots of drinks, and I could --

168
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,040
算了
never mind. That was stupid.

169
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,150
抱歉，是我胡说八道
I'm embarrassed now. Goodnight.

170
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:27,780
我觉得好丢脸

171
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,540
不会啦

172
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,600
晚安

173
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,090
两杯颓废蓝
Two Blue Ruins.

174
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,120
谢谢
Thank you.

175
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,690
干杯吧，年轻人
Drink up, young man.

176
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,620
这样勾引你比较自然
It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.

177
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,490
开玩笑啦
I'm just kidding! Come on.

178
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,130
拜托

179
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,100
你很沉默寡言
You're kind of closed-mouthed, aren't you?

180
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,750
抱歉，我…
I'm sorry.

181
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,620
我的生活…
You know, my life isn't that interesting.

182
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,190
乏善可陈

183
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,700
每天就是上班和回家
I go to work, I come home...

184
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,310
没什么话好说
I don't know what to say.

185
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,130
你应该看看我的日记
You should read my journal.

186
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,260
里面几乎是…
It's just... blank

187
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,520
一片空白
Really?

188
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,670
是吗？
Does that make you sad or anxious?

189
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,200
你觉得伤心或焦虑？

190
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,470
我经常焦虑，觉得生活不够充实
I'm always anxious, thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest.

191
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,210
要抱握每个机会
Taking advantage of every possibility and...

192
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,280
确定分秒都没浪费
making sure I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.

193
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,020
我有想过
I think about that.

194
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,220
是吗？

195
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,600
你真的人很好
You're really nice.

196
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,390
天哪，我不能再说这句话了
I have to stop saying that.

197
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,050
我要嫁给你
I'm gonna marry you.

198
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,610
我认定了
I know it.

199
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,120
好啊
Okay.

200
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:18,480
乔尔，改天陪我去查理士河
Joel. You should come up to the Charles with me sometime.

201
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,570
这个季节都结冰了
It gets frozen this time of year.

202
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,440
好像很可怕
That sounds scary.

203
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,620
对啊
Fxactly.

204
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,160
我会准备点心
I'll pack a picnic - a night picnic

205
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:26,970
晚上野餐

206
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,650
晚上野餐感觉不一样
- night picnics are different.

207
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,070
我们可以…
That sounds good.

208
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,020
好主意

209
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,980
但我该走了
But I should go now.

210
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,100
留下来嘛
You should stay.

211
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,750
不行，我真的…
I really have to get up so early and...

212
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,350
我明天要早起

213
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,330
我希望你打电话给我
I would like you to call me.

214
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,830
可以吗？
Would you do that?

215
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,220
我很期待
I'd like it.

216
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,720
好
Yes.

217
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,500
打电话来祝我情人节快乐
Wish me a happy Valentine's Day when you call.

218
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,830
我会很感动的
That'd be nice.

219
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,140
你怎么现在才打？
What took you so long?

220
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,980
我刚进门
I just walked in.

221
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,240
你想我吗？
You miss me?

222
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,870
很奇怪，我好想你
Oddly enough, I do.

223
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,330
你说你想我
You said I do.

224
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,010
我们算是结婚了
I guess that means we're married.

225
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,390
大概吧
I guess so.

226
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,800
明晚？去冰上渡蜜月？
Tomorrow night?

227
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,790
这个季节冰层很厚
Honeymoon on Ice?

228
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,180
It's really solid this time of year.

229
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,320
我不知道…
I don't know...

230
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:02,920
过来嘛
Come on...

231
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,950
快点…

232
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,380
好美
It's so beautiful.

233
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,040
可不是吗？
Isn't it?

234
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,680
别跑太远
Don't go too far!

235
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,570
还好吧？
Are you okay?

236
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:32,810
我的屁股!
Oh, my ass!

237
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,860
我该回去了
I think I should go back

238
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:35,700
来嘛
Come on!

239
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:36,980
若冰层破掉怎么办？
But what if it breaks?

240
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:40,470
怎么办？你真的在乎吗？
What if?. Do you really care right now?

241
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,630
过来一下
Come here, please.

242
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,270
滑啊…
Slidey-slidey, slidey-slidey.

243
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,870
不错嘛
This looks good.

244
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,470
过来，让你体验一下
Let me show you this one thing.

245
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,380
你要干嘛？
What are you doing?

246
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,830
来啊
Come on.

247
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,070
好像有冰裂掉的声音
Think I heard a crack

248
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,170
不会裂开
It's not going to crack

249
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:15,190
也不会破掉，很厚的
Or break It's so thick

250
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,330
说说你认识哪些星座
Show me which constellations you know.

251
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,210
不知道
I don't know.

252
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,280
我不太懂
I don't know any.

253
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,410
知道的就告诉我
Show me which ones you know.

254
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,840
好吧
Okay.

255
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,450
好吧
Okay.

256
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,740
Oh! There's Osidius.

那是奥西迪斯

258
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,540
哪里？
Where?

259
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,940
在那里，有没有看到？
Right there. See?

260
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,710
弧线和十字架
A sort of a swoop and a cross.

261
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,120
奥西迪斯星座

262
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,360
你唬烂的啦
You're full of shit, right?

263
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,900
才没有，那是奥西迪斯
no. Osidius right there.

264
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,950
弧线和十字架
Swoop and a cross.

265
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,530
别闹了
Shut up!

266
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,230
克蕾婷…

我去拿牙刷
Let me get my toothbrush.

276
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,790

00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,760
什么意思？
What do you mean?

要我帮你什么忙吗？
Can I help you with something?

不用啊

00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,940
你怎么会在这里？
What are you doing here?

284
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,520
你干嘛这样问？
I'm not really sure what you're asking me.

285
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,340
Oh.

286

太可悲了

00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,740
Don't want to end up at Mickey D's, right?

00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,690
阿波罗剧院有好戏上场了
Showtime at the Apollo.

319
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,330
小声一点
Quiet.

320
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,240
好啦

321
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,600
快拿下来
Get it off your head.

322
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,570
乔尔，你好啊
Hey, Joel. What's up?

323
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,280
法兰克
Hi, Frank

324
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,260
我只收到我妈寄的情人卡
I only get Valentine's Day cards from my mom.

325
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,340
太可悲了
How pathetic is that?

326
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:08,200
你有克蕾婷真幸运
You're lucky you have Clementine.

327
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,540
有计划好要和她共度情人节吗？
You got any big Valentine's Day plans with her?

328
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,430
没有
no.

329
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,760
只剩一天了
It's only a day away.

330
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,220
快去订位吧
Better make a reservation somewhere.

331
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:21,600
别沦落到去麦当劳过节
Don't want to end up at Mickey D's.

332
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:23,710
不会吧
Oh, no.

333
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,740
对，再过三天就是情人节了
Yes.

334
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,160
Valentine's Day is three days away.

335
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,750
要快点搞定
I want it resolved.

336
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,670
我要采取主动
I'm willing to be the one to resolve it.

337
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,340
我打电话给她
So I call her, and she's changed her number.

338
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,180
她换电话了

339
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,270
我去精品店想买礼物
So I walked over to Antic Attic to get her something.

340
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,360
想送给她
I thought I'd go over to work, give her an early Valentine...

341
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,710
我想去公司

342
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,250
提早祝她情人节快乐

343
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,760
and you won't believe it?

344
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,800
你们绝对不会相信

345
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:50,400
她和一个年轻男人在一起
She's there...

346
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,720
with this guy, this really young guy.

347
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:54,410
她看着我，好像不认识我
And she looks at me like she doesn't even know who I am.

348
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,030
抱歉
Fxcuse me?

349
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,610
你要找什么吗？
an I help you find something, sir?

350
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,630
克蕾婷宝贝
Hey, Clem-ato.

351
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,690
派屈克宝贝
Patrick! Baby boy!

352
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,360
你怎么来了？

353
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,130
我想让你惊喜一下
What are you doing here, baby?

354
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,110
需要什么再告诉我吧
Just came to surprise you.

355
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,370
Let me know if you need something.

356
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,630
你好吗？
How are you?

357
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,860
不错，很无聊，很累
Pretty good, pretty bored, pretty tired.

358
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:27,140
我想剥光你的衣服 好啊
I so want what's in your suit.

359
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,630
Oh, good.

360
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,700
她凭什么那样对我？
Why would she do that to me?

361
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,500
谁想吸一口？
Does anybody want a joint?

362
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,020
罗伯，拜托你别闹了
Rob, give it a rest.

363
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,620
天哪，她在惩罚我
She's punishing me.

364
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,380
我知道
For being honest..

365
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,400
惩罚我的诚实

366
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,510
太过份了
I should just go to her house.

367
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:57,300
我应该去她家找她
no. You don't want to go there.

368
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,700
不行，千万别去

369
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:01,550
千万别去，走开啦

370
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:02,970
实在是太…
Get off me. It's too...

371
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,850
对
Right.

372
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,640
是啊
I don't want to seem desperate.

373
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,250
我不想把事情闹大

374
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,650
就当作是一次教训吧
Joel, why don't you just see this as a sign?

375
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,730
好聚好散
Make a clean break

376
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,870
乔尔…
Alright, seriously, here's the deal.

377
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,040
说正经的…

378
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,030
罗伯…

379
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:20,860
就这么办吧
Don't do that.

380
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:23,820
别闹了，罗伯，你想干嘛？
Rob, what are you doing?

381
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,840
你有何高见，凯莉？
What's your fucking suggestion?!

382
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,640
你有什么妙点子？
What's your brilliant, reasoned solution?

383
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,000
你又想牵托到我们吗？
You're going to make this about our shit now?

384
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,050
这件事与我们无关
This isn't about us.

385
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:32,270
对，与我们无关，这是乔尔的事
I agree. It's not about us.

386
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,660
他成年了
It's about Joel, who's an adult.

387
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:36,030
不是凯莉妈妈的儿子
not Mama Carrie's kid.

388
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,620
你去洗衣服啦
Why don't you go do your laundry!

389
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,200
好极了
That's great. That's good.

390
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,600
很好

391
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,700
好吧
Okay.

392
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:00,000
拉金伉俪:克蕾婷

393
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,500
把乔尔贝里许从记忆中消除了

394
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,410
请别再向她提起两人的关系

395
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,420
忘情诊所向二位致谢
What is it?! I don't know.

396
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,550
这是什么？ 不知道，这家诊所…
It's some place that does a thing...

397
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:11,620
能让人… “忘情诊所”

398
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,860
早安，忘情诊所
Good morning. Lacuna.

399
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:26,160
抱歉，该方案只到…
no, I'm sorry.

400
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,700
That offer expired after the new Year.

401
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,590
元旦过后

402
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:32,400
对，我们可以替你安排…
Sure.

403
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:34,620
We can fit you in... how about on the 5th?

404
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:34,170
五号可以吗？

405
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,260
星期三
That's a Wednesday.

406
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,970
好的，请问贵姓大名？
Great. Could you spell that, please?

407
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,070
好，请留下白天的联络电话
Okay. And we'll need a daytime phone number.

408
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:44,610
好极了
Great. Have a nice day. See you then.

409
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,520
日安，到时候见

410
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:47,950
有何贵干？
May I help you?

411
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:49,820
我是乔尔贝里许
I'm Joel Barish.

412
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,140
你说什么？
Fxcuse me?

413
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,580
我是乔尔贝里许
I'm Joel Barish.

414
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,770
我和医生约好了，他姓…
I have an appointment with doctor...

415
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,090
莫兹维
Mierzwiak Here.

416
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,080
来吧，请你先填资料
Could you please fill this out?

417
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,200
我只是想找他谈谈
I just want to talk to him.

418
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,030
还是要请你先填资料
You still need to fill the form out.

419
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:02,800
是吗？
Really?

420
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,260
谢谢你
Thank you.

421
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,810
我没有笔
I don't have a pen.

422
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,410
那里有支笔
There's a pen right there.

423
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,640
早安，忘情诊所
Good morning. Lacuna.

424
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,080
对，该方案结束了
Oh, that offer expired after the new Year.

425
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,070
只到元旦过后

426
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,600
贝里许先生？
Mister Barish?

427
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:22,840
今天好吗？
How are we today?

428
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,850
不太好
not too good, actually.

429
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,440
天哪!史丹!
Oh my God! Stan!

430
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,110
抱歉，我只是…
Sorry. I was just

431
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:30,530
我在上班耶
I'm working.

432
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,200
对不起

433
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,800
给你，医生
Here, Doctor.

434
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:38,360
谢谢你，不应该让你看到的
Thank you.

435
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,610
You should not have seen this.

436
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,000
抱歉
I apologize.

437
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,020
这是唬人的吧？这是克蕾婷的…
This is a hoax, right?

438
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,550
如假包换
I mean, this is Clem's

439
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,950
没错
I assure you, no.

440
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,290
这是不可能的事
There's no such thing as this.

441
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:03,370
我们的资料都要保密
Our files are confidential, so I can't show you evidence.

442
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,880
所以不能拿证据给你看

443
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,520
我只能说…
Suffice it to say that Miss Kruczynski was not happy...

444
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:11,030
库钦斯基小姐过得不快乐

445
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,700
她想抛弃过去
and she wanted to move on.

446
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:16,180
我们只是如她所愿
We provide that possibility.

447
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,980
库钦斯基小姐过得不快乐
...was not happy, and wanted to move on.

448
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,720
她想抛弃过往

449
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:21,780
我们只是如她所愿
We provide that possibility.

450
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,730
这是什么鬼话？
What the hell is that?

451
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,750
她没遇过比我好的男人
I'm the nicest guy she ever went out with.

452
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:28,840
干!
Ah, fuck!

453
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,360
罗伯，别闹了
Rob, give it a rest!

454
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,400
没关系
It's okay.

455
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,140
凯莉，我在做鸟舍
I am making a birdhouse.

456
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:40,290
我无言以对
Joel, you know Clementine's just like that.

457
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,970
克蕾婷就是那么善变

458
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,950
她做事很冲动
So impulsive.

459
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:48,150
一时兴起就想忘记你
She decided to erase you as a lark

460
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,160
一时兴起？
A lark?

461
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,200
你凭什么这样对我？ 不行，等一下…
Why did you do that?

462
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,290
对不起 医生在吗？
Wait, wait!

463
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,500
医生，他硬要闯进来
I want it done. now.

464
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,370
好，替我做吧

465
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,060
现在就做
I told him pre-Valentine's Day is our busy time -

466
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,260
我说过情人节之前是我们的旺季

467
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,550
没关系，玛丽
That's okay, Mary.

468
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,600
可是还有别人在等
But there are people waiting.

469
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,700
贝里许先生，请进吧
Mister Barish, if you'd like to come inside.

470
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,850
玛丽，请你接待吴太太
Mary, if you'd take care of Mrs. Woo.

471
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,850
好的

472
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,690
吴太太，再见
Goodbye, Mrs. Woo. Of course.

473
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:30,040
贝里许先生… 首先你要回家
The first thing we need you to do, Mister Barish...

474
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,040
is to go home and collect everything you own that has...

475
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:35,910
整理出和克蕾婷有关的东西

476
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,810
some association with Clementine.

477
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:39,670
一样都不能少
Anything.

478
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,520
我们就用那些东西
We'll use these items...

479
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:45,630
在你大脑中创造克蕾婷的蓝图
to create a map of Clementine in your brain.

480
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,990
我们需要…
We'll need photos, clothing...

481
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,730
照片

482
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,710
衣服、礼物
gifts, books she may have bought you...

483
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,620
她送你的书

484
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,020
你们一起买的CD
CD's you may have bought together, journal entries...

485
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,550
日记

486
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,060
我们要搬空你家

487
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,550
消除你对克蕾婷的记忆
We want to empty your home...

488
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,940
We want to empty your life of Clementine.

489
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:06,640
等到蓝图绘制好之后
After the mapping is done,

490
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:10,390
专家今晚会去府上替你消除记忆
our technicians will do the erasing in your home tonight.

491
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,530
你明天早上醒来以后
That way, when you awake in the morning,

492
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,030
躺在床上
you'll find yourself in your...

493
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,230
感觉什么事都没发生过
own bed, as if nothing has happened, a new life awaiting you.

494
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:21,330
崭新的人生在等着你

495
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,750
没长眼睛啊!
Wake up, buddy!

496
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:34,080
抱歉，索波太太
I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.

497
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,640
同一个月不能消除记忆三次
You can't have the procedure done three times in one month.

498
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,560
就是违反规定啊
It's just not our policy here.

499
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,550
你今天好吗，贝里许先生？
How are you today, Mister Barish?

500
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,780
我还在

501
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,350
我知道情况紧急，我们尽力而为
I know it's an emergency.

502
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,160
先帮你预约三月一日
We'll do everything we can.

503
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,270
We can fit you in on March 1st.

504
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,530
你找医生谈谈
Maybe you could talk to the Doctor.

505
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,940
好，那就约个时间吧
What day would you like to come in this week?

506
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:57,780
你这礼拜哪天方便？

507
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:58,860
贝里许先生!
Mister Barish!

508
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:01,710
他今天下午很忙

509
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,610
明天12点15分左右可以吗？

510
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:09,930
我们二月最忙，因为情人节
February is very busy for us because of Valentine's Day.

511
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,310
他是史丹芬克
This is Stan Fink,

512
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:21,450
我们最资深、技术最好的专家
one of our most experienced and skilled technicians.

513
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:25,240
今晚就由他为你服务
He'll be handling your case tonight.

514
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,040
幸会，贝里许先生
Great to meet you, Mister Barish.

515
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,730
我叫乔尔贝里许
My name is Joel Barish...

516
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:34,100
要消除对克蕾婷的记忆
and I'm here to erase Clementine Kruczynski.

517
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,190
很好
Very good. now tell me about Clementine.

518
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,870
告诉我有关…

519
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,230
…克蕾婷的事

520
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:44,970
我两年前和一个
I was living with this woman, naomi...

521
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:49,590
名叫娜欧蜜的女人 …同居

522
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,120
a couple years ago, and my friends, Rob and Carrie...

523
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,680
我朋友罗伯和凯莉

524
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,140
邀我们去参加海滩派对
invited us to this party at the beach.

525
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,420
我不喜欢派对
I don't like parties.

526
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:55,890
娜欧蜜不能去
And naomi couldn't go, but I went...

527
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,980
但我去了

528
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,240
我认识了克蕾婷
and I met Clementine.

529
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,060
对不起
I'm sorry.

530
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:07,850
先从你最近的记忆开始
We'll start with your most recent memories,

531
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,470
然后往前回溯
and work backwards from there.

532
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,730
每段记忆都有情绪核心
There's an emotional core to each of our memories...

533
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,990
一旦根除了核心
and when you eradicate that core, it starts its degradation process.

534
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,990
记忆就会开始退化

535
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,560
等到你明天早上醒来
By the time you wake up in the morning,

536
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:24,970
目标的记忆就会荡然无存了
all the memories we've targeted...

537
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:24,950
will have withered and disappeared.

538
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,620
一切都如梦初醒
As in a dream upon waking.

539
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,500
会不会损坏大脑？
Is there any risk of brain damage?

540
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:35,480
技术上消除记忆就是损坏大脑
Technically speaking, the procedure is brain damage.

541
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:39,170
只是和一夜宿醉差不多
But it's on a par with a night of heavy drinking.

542
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,330
没什么后遗症
nothing you'll miss.

543
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,690
舒服吗？
Comfortable?

544
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,780
我们要绘制…
What we're doing here is actually creating a map of your brain.

545
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,290
你的大脑蓝图

546
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,720
好，开始吧
Let's get started.

547
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,920
今晚要处理好就得赶工
If we want to get this procedure underway tonight,

548
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:57,430
看到每样东西都要有所回应
we have some work to do.

549
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,830
I want you to react to these objects.

550
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,640
请你配合

551
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,210
那个东西有个故事…
There's a good story behind that

552
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,780
不，只要有情绪反应就够了
I'll get a much better emotional read-out...

553
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:09,400
最好避免口头上的描述
if you refrain from any sort of verbal description of the items.

554
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:12,880
请你专心地回忆

555
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,050
Just please try to focus on the memories.

556
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,610
抱歉，我懂了
Sorry.

557
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,200
大脑活动正常
Healthy activity up there again.

558
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:18,960
很好
Healthy read-outs.

559
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,010
指数正常
Very good.

560
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:21,550
很好

561
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,050
再换一样东西
Here's another object.

562
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,890
下一件物品
next item.

563
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:31,080
好，蛋头先生

564
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,220
Po-ta-to head.

565
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,670
下一件物品
next item.

566
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,740
好，蛋头先生

567
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,820
请你专心地回忆
Just focus on the memories.

568
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,670
派屈克，帮个忙
Patrick, do me a favor, will you?

569
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,110
派屈克，请你帮个忙

570
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:42,900
好
Can you check the voltage regulator?

571
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:46,040
把电压调强一点

572
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,010
怎么回事？
Voltage looks fine.

573
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,190
电压很正常
Really?

574
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,310
是吗？
I'm not wiping as clean as I like here.

575
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:52,090
记忆消除得不够干净

576
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:00,170
技术上消除记忆就是损坏大脑
Technically, the procedure is brain damage.

577
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,940
只是和一夜宿醉差不多 没什么后遗症
But it's on a par with a night of heavy drinking.

578
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:06,010
检查连线是否正常
Check the connections, please.

579
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,110
原来你在这儿
There you are.

580
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,390
怎么回事？

581
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,080
我都搞糊涂了
I don't understand what I'm looking at.

582
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,390
我怎么会站在这里？
Why am I standing here and...

583
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,590
天哪，似曾相识
Oh, my God, deja vu.

584
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,430
似曾相识
This is so... We should get started.

585
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,310
我觉得…

586
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,730
好，开始吧
If we want to get the procedure...

587
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,110
今晚要处理好就得赶工了
underway tonight, we have some work to do.

588
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,650
我进入大脑里了
I'm in my head already, aren't I?

589
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,080
大概吧
I suppose so.

590
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,520
这样可以了

591
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,990
差不多就是这样了
This is what it would look like.

592
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:45,740
很好
Very good.

593
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,220
记忆消除之后我们会销毁纪念品
We'll dispose of these mementos when we're done here.

594
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,420
免得你日后在家里
Then you won't be confused later

595
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,510
对这些东西感到莫名其妙
by their unexplainable presence in your home.

596
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:55,790
开始吧…派屈克？
Patrick?

597
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,640
什么事？

598
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,130
派屈克？

599
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,180
派屈克？
Patrick?

600
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,540
派屈克？
Why are there so many wires?

601
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:04,110
这么多条线是干嘛？

602
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,580
因为设备很多啊
Because we have a lot of equipment.

603
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,790
有用吗？
Does that help?

604
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,610
你确定机器操作正确吗？
Are you sure you set that thing up properly?

605
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,340
怎样？

606
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:12,630
贝里许先生，你今天好吗？

607
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,750
好了，贝里许先生

608
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:14,830
这样好多了
I don't know if I like this.

609
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:15,420
贝里许先生？

610
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,840
我不确定这样做妥不妥当

611
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:19,140
试试看再说，快完成了

612
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:22,720
你的日记，那是无价之宝
Ah, yourjournal.

613
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,110
That'll be invaluable.

614
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:24,870
我今晚认识了一个人
I met someone tonight. I don't know what to do.

615
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,610
我今晚认识了一个人，天哪

616
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:27,380
我不知道该怎么办才好
Her name's Clementine and she's amazing.

617
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,180
她叫克蕾婷

618
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:28,880
她是个特别的女孩

619
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,970
我不知道… 她叫克蕾…

620
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,140
天哪
Whoa, Jesus! What? What?

621
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:32,840
怎么了…
Careful! Step back!

622
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:33,890
拜托!小心! 怎么了？

623
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,280
走开!

624
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,340
慢慢来

625
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:38,860
没事了
It's fine.

626
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,750
千万别毁了他的大脑
Let's not roach the guy.

627
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,110
好，消除了
Alright. We got that one.

628
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,200
你不觉得这里像猪圈吗？
This place is sort of a dump, don't you think?

629
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,640
这是公寓，派屈克
It's an apartment, Patrick

630
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,950
派屈克
Patrick

631
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,170
不是猪圈
Well, not a dump, but sort of plain.

632
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,810
但有点简陋

633
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:57,540
平凡无奇
Uninspired.

634
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,680
而且有股…臭味
And there's sort of a stale smell.

635
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:01,860
派屈克…
Patrick Can we just get through this?

636
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:06,530
先把正事办完，今晚还得赶工呢

637
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:07,850
We've got a long night ahead of us.

638
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,220
好吧

639
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:08,830
猪头

640
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,500
这是我最后一次见到你
This is the last time I saw you.

641
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:32,860
现在是三点钟
It's three o'clock

642
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:38,160
我把你的车撞坏了
I kind of wrecked your car.

643
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,920
酒后驾车
Driving drunk

644
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,600
你真该死
It's pathetic.

645
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,590
我只是微醺而已
I was a little tipsy.

646
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,980
别骂我该死
Don't call me pathetic!

647
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,620
你很该死
It is pathetic.

648
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,020
做事不负责任，可能会撞死人
It's irresponsible.

649
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,060
You could have killed somebody.

650
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,310
不知道，你可能真的撞死人了
Maybe you did kill somebody.

651
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,260
要不要看看电视新闻？
Should we turn on the news and see?

652
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,790
还是要检查保险杆
Should I check the grill to see if there's children or small animals?

653
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,040
别闹了，我没撞死人

654
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:57,730
有没有小孩或小动物？
It's just a fucking dent.

655
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,820
只是撞凹了

656
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,980
天哪，你像个老太婆碎碎念的
You're like an old lady or something.

657
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,360
你是怎样？
What are you like?

658
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:04,800
酒鬼吗？
A wino?

659
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,120
酒鬼？
Jesus.

660
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,130
天哪
Are you from the 50's or something?

661
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,880
你是50年代的人吗？酒鬼？

662
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,340
A wino?

663
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,340
面对现实吧
Face it.

664
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,780
你是气我晚归，丢下你一个人
You're freaked out because I was out late without you...

665
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,740
你那个猪脑袋只想着
and in your little, wormy brain, you're trying to figure out...

666
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,670
我到底有没有跟别人上床

667
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,230
Did she fuck someone tonight?

668
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,900
我早就料到你会跟别人上床
See, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight.

669
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,730
你不是习惯这样勾引人？
Isn't that how you get people to like you?

670
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,720
对不起
I'm sorry, okay?

671
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:50,420
我不是故意的克蕾婷…
I didn't mean it.

672
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:55,970
钥匙还你
Your keys.

673
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:56,960
我只是…
I won't need them anymore.

674
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:57,930
我用不着了
I was just angry or annoyed or something.

675
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,570
我只是…

676
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:03,350
自己在生闷气，我不知道

677
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,510
克蕾婷？
Clem.

678
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:15,780
好了
Got it.

679
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,080
玛丽今晚会过来
Mary's coming over tonight.

680
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,020
是吗？
Just thought you'd want to know.

681
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:21,930
对，先知会你一声

682
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,360
我喜欢玛丽
I like when Mary comes to visit.

683
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:26,100
我喜欢她来访，可惜她不喜欢我
I just don't think she likes me.

684
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,640
她不讨厌你啦
She likes you okay.

685
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,290
我应该找我女朋友过来
So maybe I should invite my girlfriend over.

686
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,340
我交了女朋友
I have a girlfriend now.

687
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,940
随便你
Do whatever you want.

688
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,540
天哪，我…

689
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,380
好吧

690
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,820
我有没有说过我交了新女友？
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?

691
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,350
专心一点
We have to focus here.

692
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,570
重点是…
The thing is, my situation is a little weird.

693
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,280
我的情况…

694
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,570
有点诡异
My girlfriend situation.

695
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,530
我女朋友的情况

696
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,990
想也知道
I'm sure it is.

697
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:56,790
你是…

698
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,330
克蕾婷，我送你回家
Clem, let me drive you home.

699
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,120
滚远一点，变态!
Get out of my face, faggot!

700
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,590
你看!
Look at it out here!

701
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,540
快要荡然无存了
It's all falling apart!

702
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:35,290
我要消除关于你的记忆
I'm erasing you, and I'm happy!

703
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,420
我很高兴，是你先负我的
You did it to me first!

704
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,630
你竟敢这样对我!
I can't believe you did this to me!

705
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,170
可恶!
Goddamnit!

706
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,600
克蕾婷，听见没？
Clem. Did you hear me?

707
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,840
明天早上你就要消失了
By morning you'll be gone!

708
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:50,630
这段孽缘划下完美的句点
The perfect ending to this piece of shit story!

709
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:59,160
有女孩喜欢我… 不行吗？有问题吗？
Is there something wrong with a girl being attracted to me?

710
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,930
没有，只是觉得…
no. I think it's funny.

711
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,080
很好笑
Who do you think's better- looking, me or this guy?

712
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,920
你认为谁比较帅？

713
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,420
我？还是这砘铮
Patrick, let's focus.

714
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,810
专心一点

715
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,280
记不记得上礼拜来的那个女孩？
Remember that girl we did last week?

716
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,090
那个…
The one with the potatoes?

717
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,280
带蛋头先生来的？

718
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,860
那个女孩？
That girl?

719
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:16,800
对
That's this guy's girlfriend.

720
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,640
她是这砘锏呐朋友

721
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,310
曾经是啦
Was. We took care of that.

722
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,890
我们处理掉了

723
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:24,620
天哪

724
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,390
我…

725
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,310
我当晚就对她一见钟情
I kind of fell in love with her that night.

726
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:29,910
什么？
What?

727
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,480
你这个烂人
You little fucker.

728
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,520
怎样？
What?

729
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,200
她毫无意识耶
She was unconscious.

730
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:37,250
她很漂亮
She was beautiful, and I stole a pair of her panties, too.

731
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,600
我还偷了她的内裤

732
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,220
天哪
Jesus!

733
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:46,860
怎样？我又不是…
They were clean.

734
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,170
是干净的内裤啦
I don't want to hear this shit.

735
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,430
别告诉我这些事，我不想听

736
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,200
内裤是干净的
They were clean.

737
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:53,120
什么？别再说了
Stop. We've got work to do.

738
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:53,770
好
Okay. Fine.

739
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,470
我们还有正事要做

740
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,870
好吧 知道了

741
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,370
报纸拿去

742
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:16,150
还不只这样

743
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,360
There's more.

744
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:25,050
她记忆消除了我就约她出去
After we did her, I kind of asked her out.

745
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:27,710
天哪

746
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,590
Jesus.

747
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,440
你不觉得很不道德吗？
Do you know how unethical...?

748
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:39,950
没那么严重啦
It's not really that bad.

749
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:42,760
别作出那种表情，怎样？
Get that look off your face.

750
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:43,360
What's wrong?

751
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,970
你偷了女生的内裤耶
You stole a girl's panties.

752
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,470
有人闯进来
There's someone here... he stole your underwear.

753
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:02,910
他偷了你的内裤

754
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,640
我没看到人啊
I don't see anyone.

755
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:26,780
乔尔，我的靴子呢？
Joel, where are my boots?

756
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,390
你干嘛拿毒药给我？

757
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,640
听不懂英语吗？

758
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:33,600
我只叫你拿药

759
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,710
给我爱的配方

760
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:46,160
我快急死了啦
I'm crawling out of my skin!

761
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,020
早知道就把你丢在跳蚤市场
I should have left you at the flea market.

762
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,500
要走了吗？
Want to go?

763
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,640
我想生小孩
I want to have a baby.

764
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:11,800
改天再说
Let's talk about it later.

765
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:15,320
不要，我想生小孩
no. I want to have a baby.

766
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,820
我们还没准备好
I don't think we're ready.

767
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:20,840
你还没准备好
You're not ready.

768
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:25,160
你自以为能照顾小孩吗？
Do you really think you could take care of a kid?

769
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:27,350
怎样？
What?

770
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:30,580
我不想在这里谈
I don't want to talk about it here.

771
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:31,800
我听不见
I can't hear you.

772
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,610
从来就听不懂你在说什么
I can never understand what you're saying!

773
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,070
我说我不想在这里谈
I said I don't want to talk about this!

774
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:35,980
什么腹语嘛
We're fucking gonna talk about it!

775
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:36,850
我们非谈不可

776
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:38,350
我不想在这里…
You can't just say you don't want to talk about it!

777
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:40,360
你不能说这种话

778
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,610
别说你不想谈
I'm sorry.

779
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,270
对不起
I'd make a fucking good mother!

780
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,810
我会是个好母亲

781
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:44,850
我喜欢小孩
I love children.

782
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,690
好啦，你会是个好母亲 我有创意又聪明
I'm creative and I'm smart!

783
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,130
一定会是个好母亲 天哪

784
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:50,410
问题出在你
It's you, Joel.

785
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,470
你给不起承诺
It's you who can't commit to anything.

786
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:53,550
快要不见了…
It's going! It's going. You're lucky I'm interested in you.

787
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:55,880
你不知道我爱上你是你的福气

788
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:58,310
我头壳坏去才会爱上你
I don't even know why I am.

789
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,460
Maybe I should end it right here! It's over.

790
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,010
或许应该到此为止
Leave you at the flea market, with the costume jewelry!

791
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,820
结束了，结束这段孽缘

792
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:02,770
把打扮可笑的你丢在跳蚤市场
Maybe you can find a nice antique rocking chair to die in!

793
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:06,390
说不定你能死在古董摇椅上 我痛苦又困惑

794
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,580
派屈克 玛丽，你好啊
All the pain. Confusion... Hi, Patrick

795
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:17,380
过来
How's it going, Mary?

796
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:20,300
外面好冷 这里还好找吧？
It's freezing outside.

797
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:22,000
还好
Find us okay?

798
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:22,120
Yeah.

799
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,270
好热情
Hot.

800
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,670
可怜的砘
Poor guy.

801
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:36,550
有酒喝吗？
Do you have anything real to drink?

802
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,020
没找过
We haven't checked yet.

803
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:39,750
派屈克？
Patrick?

804
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,110
好的
Let me do the honors.

805
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:42,530
不，让我去吧

806
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,300
玛丽讨厌我
Mary hates me.

807
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,520
我泡妞技术一级烂
never really had much luck with the ladies.

808
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:50,960
别再偷女生内裤就好了
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.

809
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,650
史丹，还不只如此

810
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:55,930
不会吧 就是

811
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,180
不会吧

812
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:58,390
我受够了

813
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:03,440
你不想喝吧，派屈克？
You didn't want any, did you, Patrick?

814
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:05,810
我不知道，无所谓
no. That's okay.

815
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:06,960
等一下
Wait.

816
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,090
祝福健忘的人
Blessed are the forgetful,

817
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,550
因为忘记错误会过得比较好
for they get the better even of their blunders.

818
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:23,980
尼采说的
That's nietzsche.

819
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,580
摘自“善恶的彼岸”
Beyond Good and Fvil.

820
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,790
我在名人语录里看到的
I found it in my Bartlett's.

821
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,470
名人语录是什么？
What's your Bartlett's?

822
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:32,320
就是引经据典的书
It's a quote book

823
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:34,130
收集名人说过的话
It's a book of quotations.

824
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,460
有朝一日霍华也会成为名人
I think Howard will be in Bartlett's one day.

825
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:39,350
对，霍华有成名的条件
Definitely.

826
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,220
Howard is pure Bartlett's.

827
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,880
天哪

828
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,220
会不会吵醒他？
Can you wake him up?

829
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:46,200
不可能吵醒他
You can't wake him up.

830
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:57,060
你什么事都不告诉我
You don't tell me things.

831
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,150
我毫无保留
I'm an open book

832
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,670
什么事都告诉你
I tell you everything.

833
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:06,770
什么糗事都告诉你
Fvery damn embarrassing thing.

834
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:11,740
你不信任我
You don't trust me.

835
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:15,430
碎碎念未必就是沟通
Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating.

836
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:18,980
才没有
I don't do that.

837
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:24,830
我是想了解你
I want to know you.

838
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,200
我没碎碎念
I don't constantly talk

839
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:30,670
拜托
Jesus.

840
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,880
我们要同甘苦共患难
People have to share things.

841
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:38,460
这才是亲密关系
That's what intimacy is.

842
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,590
你说这句话我很生气
I'm really pissed that you said that to me!

843
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,200
抱歉
Sorry.

844
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:47,750
只是我的生活没那么多彩多姿
My life just really isn't that interesting.

845
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:51,160
我想看你每天日记写些什么
I want to read those journals you're constantly scribbling in.

846
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:54,710
你会写日记就一定有想法或热情
What do you write if you don't have any thoughts or passions or love?

847
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:56,170
或是爱

848
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,700
11月19日
november 19th, Two thousand three.

849
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:07,200
2003年

850
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:10,890
又在康家小馆吃晚饭
Dinner at Kang's again.

851
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,900
我们和餐厅里那些
Are we like those poor couples

852
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,710
你觉得可悲的情侣一样吗？
you feel...sorry for in restaurants?

853
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:21,400
只吃饭、不聊天？
Are we the dining dead?

854
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:24,800
我受不了有人这样看我们
I can't stand the idea of us being a couple people think that about.

855
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:31,650
我喜欢你的头发
I like that.

856
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:36,290
鸡肉好不好吃？
How's the chicken?

857
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:37,920
好吃
Good.

858
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:40,460
还要吗？
More?

859
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,620
不要了，谢谢
no, thank you.

860
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:49,230
她一定会喝醉，然后大出洋相
She's going to be drunk and stupid now.

861
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:51,590
你能不能帮个忙？
Would you do me a favor and clean the goddamn hair...

862
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:53,650
洗完澡把肥皂上的头发清干净？
off the soap when you're done in the shower?

863
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:55,630
真的很…
Yeah, it's gross.

864
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:56,220
对，很恶心

865
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:59,560
很恶心，我觉得…

866
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:01,580
令人作呕
I think it's just...

867
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,380
令人作呕
Repulsive.

868
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,200
It's repulsive.

869
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:11,290
派屈克，快弄完啦
Can we get through this?

870
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:14,410
派屈克？
Patrick?

871
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,510
橘子妹
Hey, Tangerine.

872
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:18,310
派屈克，是你啊
Patrick, it's you.

873
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,410
我现在好惨
I'm so miserable right now.

874
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,570
怎么了？
What's wrong?

875
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:25,100
我不知道
I don't know.

876
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,190
每件事我都搞不清楚
I'm just confused about everything.

877
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:32,520
What are you confused about?

878
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:31,640
搞不清楚？

879
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:36,820
搞不清楚什么？根本没事啊
Fverything's fine.

880
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:42,080
你爱我吗？
Do you love me?

881
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,640
我当然爱你
Of course I do.

882
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:45,520
励志的书在哪里？
Where's the self-help section?

883
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,780
你觉得我丑吗？
Do you think I'm ugly?

884
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:50,110
不会，你很漂亮
no. You're beautiful.

885
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:51,330
我过去找你
Maybe I should come over.

886
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,730
不用了，我不知道
Oh no. I'm a mess.

887
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,100
我现在好狼狈

888
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,230
我去找你，让你开心一下
Just let me come over. I'll cheer you up.

889
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:00,440
好吧
Okay.

890
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:02,430
史丹，我出去一下
Can I leave for a while?

891
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:04,860
我女友心情不好
My girlfriend's really upset.

892
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:06,540
我们在消除这个可怜虫的…
We're right in the middle of erasing this poor man's -

893
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,620
让他去吧，史丹

894
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:10,780
让他去，我来帮忙
Let him go. I'll help.

895
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:11,830
看吧？
How hard can it be?

896
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:13,000
有什么困难嘛
She hates me.

897
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:14,920
她讨厌我，想赶我走
She wants me to go.

898
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,270
去吧
Go.

899
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:17,730
好
Alright.

900
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,610
我马上过去，橘子妹
I'll be right over, Tangerine.

901
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,790
你喜欢吗？
You like?

902
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:24,870
天哪
I matched my sweatshirt exactly.

903
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:27,070
和我的衣服很速配

904
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:27,720
我喜欢
I like it.

905
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:28,590
真的？
You look like a tangerine.

906
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,880
你看起来就像一颗橘子

907
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,850
橘子妹克蕾婷
Clemen-teen the tangerine.

908
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:35,240
美味多汁
Juicy and seedless.

909
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:38,860
又无籽
I like that.

910
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:39,690
我喜欢
I like tangerines.

911
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,750
我喜欢橘子

912
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:43,130
看得出来这是鸭子吗？
Can you see me doing ducks?

913
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,010
看不出来
Tangerine...

914
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,230
鸭子，呱呱
How does he know to call you that?

915
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:47,770
他怎么知道你叫橘子妹？

916
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:49,190
谁怎么知道？
How did who know?

917
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:50,160
天哪
Oh my God. Clem?

918
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:50,960
酷毙了

919
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:51,940
克蕾婷？
That's what they called themselves.

920
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,540
那是他们自称的
The Clash, the only band that mattered.

921
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,120
比如知名的冲击合唱团

922
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,310
他们自称冲击是有原因的
And they called themselves that for a reason.

923
00:48:58,450 --> 00:48:59,240
很棒吧？
It's amazing, isn't it?

924
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:02,130
比如社会正义合唱团，了不起
Like Social Justice.

925
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:02,200
Yeah, it's totally incredible.

926
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,740
霍华对世人贡献不小
What Howard gives to the world.

927
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,980
是啊
Yeah.

928
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,960
让人们重生
To let people begin again.

929
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:13,720
功德无量
It's beautiful.

930
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:16,260
看着纯真无邪的婴儿
You look at a baby, and it's so pure and so free and so...

931
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,910
自由自在又纯洁

932
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:19,960
clean and...

933
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:23,660
成年人满脑子悲哀
Adults are this mess of sadness and...

934
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:26,560
还有恐惧
phobias.

935
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,950
霍华能消除这些记忆
And Howard just makes it all go away.

936
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,090
天哪

937
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,430
宝贝，怎么了？
Baby, what's going on?

938
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:44,300
我不知道
I don't know.

939
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,430
不知道，我迷失了
I'm lost, I'm scared, I feel like I'm disappearing.

940
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:47,630
我好害怕

941
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:49,410
我好像快要消失了

942
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,070
消失？
My skin's coming off!.

943
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,230
我在脱皮，我老了
I'm getting old!

944
00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:53,590
什么事都说不通
nothing makes any sense to me!

945
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:54,770
你没变老
You're not getting old.

946
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,470
什么事都说不通
nothing makes any sense.

947
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:58,180
什么事都说不通
nothing makes any sense.

948
00:49:58,330 --> 00:49:59,090
橘子妹…
Tangerine...

949
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:00,890
什么事都说不通

950
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:03,230
什么事都说不通

951
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:04,020
没事了
It's okay.

952
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:05,170
没事了
Let's go out dancing.

953
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,610
我们出去跳舞

954
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:09,590
要不要陪我去蒙托克？
You want to go out to Montauk with me?

955
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:10,770
蒙托克？ 对
Montauk?

956
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,900
不!陪我去波士顿
Yeah. no! Come up to Boston with me.

957
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,780
好，下周末去
Sure. We can go next weekend.

958
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,180
不行，现在就去
no. I have to go now.

959
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,600
我现在就要去
I have to see the frozen Charles now.

960
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:21,290
我要去看结冰的查理士河

961
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:26,600
我是乔尔
Hi, it's Joel.

962
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:31,120
请在哔声之后留话
Leave me a message after the beep and I'll get back to you.

963
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:33,390
我会尽快回电

964
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:35,260
接啊
Pick up.

965
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:36,420
快接啊

966
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,400
等一下…

967
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:42,890
喂？
Hello? What's up?

968
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:44,340
什么事？
I got into a little situation with the old lady.

969
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,930
我女朋友有点急事

970
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:50,260
你今晚一个人可以吗？歹势啦
Can you handle things tonight alone?

971
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:50,270
I'm really sorry.

972
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:52,590
没问题，情况控制下来了
Don't worry. I've got it under control.

973
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,790
现在只能顺水推舟
He's on auto-pilot now anyway.

974
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:56,630
谢了，算我欠你的
Thanks. I owe you big-time.

975
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:58,850
我要挂电话了
I've got to go.

976
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:02,720
查理士河

977
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:08,770
查理士河在哪里？

978
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:14,720
你看，我们在查理士河上
Look! You and me on the Charles River.

979
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:16,180
我死而无憾了
I could die right now.

980
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:17,750
我好快乐
I'm just happy.

981
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,030
从来没有过这种感觉
I've never felt that before.

982
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:21,580
这里正是我想来的地方
I'm exactly where I want --

983
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,470
我好兴奋
I'm so excited!

984
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:25,680
我也是
I'm excited, too.

985
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:28,020
酷毙了
Cool.

986
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:32,190
这是我送你的…

987
00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:34,390
I got you this thing.

988
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:35,360
…礼物

989
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,680
祝你情人节快乐
Happy early Valentine's Day.

990
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:43,460
这是什么？
Wow. What is it?

991
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:45,410
不知道，拆开来看看
I don't know. Open it up.

992
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:54,420
好漂亮
It's gorgeous.

993
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:55,150
喜欢吗？
You like it?

994
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,440
喜欢，正合我意
It's just my taste, really.

995
00:51:57,590 --> 00:51:58,080
天哪
I've never gone out with a guy who bought me jewelry I liked.

996
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:01,280
前男友都没送过我喜欢的首饰

997
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:04,370
谢谢你
Thank you.

998
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:13,590
走吧 好
Joely?

999
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:15,290
乔尔？
Yeah, Tangerine?

1000
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,760
什么事？

1001
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:19,540
我很丑吗？
Am I ugly?

1002
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:24,690
我小时候觉得自己很丑
When I was a kid I thought I was.

1003
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,300
我居然说到这儿哭了
Can't believe I'm crying already.

1004
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:30,680
有些人…
Sometimes I think people don't understand

1005
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:32,660
不知道当小孩有多孤单
how lonely it is to be a kid.

1006
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,330
一点也不在乎

1007
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:41,490
我八岁时有好多玩具和洋娃娃
Like you don't matter.

1008
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:40,700
So, I'm eight...

1009
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:48,210
我最喜欢一个丑娃娃
and I have these toys, these dolls.

1010
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:50,340
My favorite is this ugly girl doll who I call Clementine.

1011
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:52,320
我叫她“克蕾婷” 我一直对她大叫…

1012
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:54,200
And I keep yelling at her You can't be ugly!

1013
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,160
“你不能当丑小鸭”

1014
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,590
“要变天鹅”
Be pretty!

1015
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:57,950
好奇怪
It's weird.

1016
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:01,050
若我有魔法能让她变身
Like if I can transform her...

1017
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,730
我也会让自己变身
I would magically change, too.

1018
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:10,540
你很漂亮
You're pretty.

1019
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:11,900
乔尔…
Joely. Don't ever leave me.

1020
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,140
不要离开我

1021
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:18,750
你很漂亮…
You're pretty.

1022
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,450
莫兹维…
Please let me keep this memory.

1023
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:22,370
请你让我保留这段记忆

1024
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,320
这一段就好
Just this one.

1025
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:27,140
我想握住你的手，来嘛
I want to hold your hand. Come on.

1026
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:32,780
别闹了
Stop it!

1027
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,750
我现在死而无憾了
I could die right now.

1028
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:41,230
我实在是…
I'm just... so happy.

1029
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:43,840
太快乐了

1030
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,780
我从来没有过这种感觉
I've never felt that before.

1031
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,000
这里正是…
I'm just exactly...

1032
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:58,590
我想来的地方
where I want to be.

1033
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,800
克蕾婷？
Clem.

1034
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:10,080
我想就此打住
I want to call it off.

1035
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:12,540
我会提示你

1036
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,330
我想就此打住
I want to call it off.

1037
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:26,880
听见没？我不想玩了! 停下来!
Can you hear me?!

1038
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,260
I want to call it off!.

1039
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,540
有人在吗？
Is anybody there?!!

1040
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,280
克蕾婷？

1041
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:45,070
乔尔？
Joel.

1042
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:46,160
克蕾…
Joel.

1043
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:47,310
乔尔？
I am.

1044
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:48,280
克蕾婷!
Joel.

1045
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:49,630
乔尔？

1046
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:50,710
克蕾婷!

1047
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,170
克蕾婷!

1048
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:53,010
怎么了？

1049
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:54,160
快走 快走
We've got to go. What? Where?

1050
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:55,580
怎么了？去哪儿？

1051
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:57,150
我知道该怎么停止了
I have an idea of how to stop this.

1052
00:54:57,290 --> 00:54:59,200
停止什么？
Stop what?

1053
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:00,630
乔尔…
Joel. Come on.

1054
00:55:00,770 --> 00:55:02,360
快点

1055
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:04,560
不…别搔我痒，不要啦
Don't tickle me.

1056
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:05,640
你闻闻看
no! Don't!

1057
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:06,750
闻我的胳肢窝
Smell my armpits!

1058
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:07,510
别闹了

1059
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:08,730
专心一点
Concentrate, Clem. We've got to get back to the office.

1060
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:09,460
克蕾婷

1061
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:11,930
我们要回到办公室

1062
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:14,330
万圣节
Halloween.

1063
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,830
有一台录音机
There was a tape recorder.

1064
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:18,310
不行，别碰那张照片
no, not the picture!

1065
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:20,600
找到了
Back here.

1066
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:22,820
就在这里，快点
Come on!

1067
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:23,760
看着我
Look at me. I want to go there!

1068
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:25,670
我想去那里

1069
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:28,850
我们的资料都要保密
Our files are confidential, Mister Barish,

1070
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:30,750
所以不能拿证据给你看
so I can't show you evidence.

1071
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,880
我只能说…
Suffice it so say that Miss Chryzinski...

1072
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:36,050
库钦斯基小姐过得不快乐

1073
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:38,450
was not happy and she wanted to move on.

1074
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:39,340
她想抛弃过往

1075
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:41,610
冷静下来，告诉我…
Just tell me everything you remember.

1076
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:42,930
告诉我你记得的每件事
That's what he said.

1077
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,010
他只说了这句话

1078
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:44,740
然后…
What did we see that day?

1079
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:45,750
我们当天看到了什么？

1080
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:46,410
不，等一下…
Oh, look!

1081
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:47,280
你看!

1082
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:48,190
可恶!
We're going to see my grandma!

1083
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:50,030
我们要去看我祖母

1084
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,280
不行，别搭火车
no. We're not going on a train.

1085
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:53,570
为什么？我不想…
Joel, please.

1086
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:54,590
求求你，别叫我用跑的
Don't make me run!

1087
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:55,840
快点!
Come on. Mierzwiak!

1088
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:57,990
莫兹维!

1089
00:55:58,700 --> 00:55:59,710
非跑不可吗？
Do we always have to run?

1090
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:01,760
莫兹维!

1091
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:12,790
求求你
Please?

1092
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:18,070
先告诉我你记得的每件事…
Why don't we begin by you telling me everything

1093
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:21,240
莫兹维!叫醒我!
you can remember -

1094
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:21,220
Mierzwiak! Wake me up!

1095
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:27,250
抱歉，我以为你知道后果会如何
I'm sorry.

1096
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:27,130
I thought you understood what was going on here.

1097
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,410
我不知道
You're erasing her from me.

1098
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:30,280
你要把她从我记忆中消除

1099
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:34,110
你要把我从她记忆中消除
You're erasing me from her.

1100
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:37,520
我不知道

1101
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:39,260
你用一种机器
You have this thing.

1102
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:41,520
我躺在床上，我有意识
I'm in my bed. I know it.

1103
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:43,400
我进入了我的大脑里
I'm in my brain.

1104
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:46,840
我也是你想像出来的
I'm part of your imagination, too.

1105
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:48,450
你要我怎么帮你？
How can I help you from there?

1106
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:53,310
我也在你的大脑里，我就是你
I'm inside your head, too.

1107
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:52,950
I'm you!

1108
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,620
对不起
Sorry.

1109
00:56:57,810 --> 00:56:58,750
他是谁？
Who's that?

1110
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:02,430
他是我们的员工，名叫…
He works for us. That's...

1111
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:08,250
派屈克宝贝
Paaaaaa-trick..baaaaaby boy.

1112
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:10,890
他假冒我的身份
He's stealing my identity.

1113
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:12,690
他偷了我的东西
He stole my stuff.

1114
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:16,940
他用我的话和礼物勾引我女友
He's seducing my girlfriend with my words.

1115
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,820
他偷了她的内裤
He stole her underwear.

1116
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,580
天哪，他偷了她的内裤
Jesus Christ. He stole her underwear.

1117
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,110
我现在死而无憾了
I could die right now. I'm just happy.

1118
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:26,990
我好快乐

1119
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,020
从来没有过那种感觉
I've never felt that before.

1120
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:32,570
这里正是我想来的地方
I'm exactly where I want to be.

1121
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:35,900
我想回家
I want to go home.

1122
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:39,560
什么？
What?

1123
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:43,410
克蕾婷!
Clem!

1124
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,270
等等我!
Wait, Clem!

1125
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:52,260
他们要把你从我记忆中消除
Clem, they're erasing you.

1126
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:55,120
不，你看这边
Over here!

1127
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,020
专心一点
Focus. I hired them.

1128
00:57:57,170 --> 00:57:58,350
他们是我花钱请来的
I'm sorry. I'm so stupid.

1129
00:57:58,490 --> 00:57:59,880
抱歉，是我愚蠢

1130
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:03,180
冷静下来，好好欣赏风景
Sweetie, calm down.

1131
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:04,470
我要阻止他们
Fnjoy the scenery.

1132
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:06,530
免得醒来就忘记你了
I need it to stop before I wake up and don't know you any more.

1133
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:07,910
好啊

1134
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:12,200
直接叫他们取消嘛
Just tell them to cancel it then.

1135
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,220
你在胡说什么？
What are you talking about?

1136
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,720
不能取消，我陷入昏迷了
I can't just cancel it. I'm asleep.

1137
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:18,040
你自己醒过来啊
Wake yourself up.

1138
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:19,120
好吧，要我醒过来吗？
Want me to wake up?

1139
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:20,690
好，没问题
Okay.

1140
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,850
来吧，要我尝试你才满意吗？
This make you happy if I try?

1141
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:24,520
对
Yeah. I'll try really hard.

1142
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:25,110
我会努力的
Here we go. That was a great idea.

1143
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:26,530
来吧，好主意

1144
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:27,920
就这样

1145
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:29,240
好了

1146
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:31,750
效果不错嘛
That's working like gangbusters.

1147
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:35,020
天哪，我好痒

1148
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,870
天哪，这是什么？天哪，这… 这是胎记啦
That tickles me!

1149
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,760
What the hell is that?

1150
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:40,130
你是怎么弄的？
It's a birthmark!

1151
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,430
刚才有用
It did work, for a second.

1152
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,700
可是我没办法…

1153
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:47,270
看吧？
See?

1154
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:49,360
我动弹不得
But I couldn't move.

1155
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:52,270
这不也是乔尔打算
Isn't that just another one of Joel's self-fulfilling prophecies?

1156
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:54,050
自己实现的预言吗？
It's more important to prove me wrong than to actually -

1157
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,300
最好证明我错了，不要…
I don't want to discuss this right now, okay?

1158
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:56,940
我现在不想讨论这个

1159
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,290
好吧

1160
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:00,190
Fine.

1161
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:03,480
不然要怎样？
Then what? I'm listening.

1162
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:05,570
我洗耳恭听
I don't know.

1163
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:06,540
我不知道
You erased me.

1164
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:07,790
你消除了对我的记忆
That's why I'm doing this.

1165
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:09,290
所以我才会来这里

1166
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:10,440
这就是我当初的来意
I'm sorry.

1167
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:11,000
对不起

1168
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:12,040
你…
You know me. I'm impulsive.

1169
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:14,720
你最了解我，我向来很冲动

1170
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:20,460
我就是喜欢这样的你
That's what I love about you.

1171
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:25,460
乔尔？
Joel.

1172
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:29,190
我有另一个解决办法
I have another idea for this problem.

1173
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:31,770
有个关于我的回忆
This is a memory of me.

1174
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:34,310
你看过我的阴部之后
The way you wanted to...

1175
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:36,270
have sex on the couch after you look down at my crotch.

1176
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:37,470
就想和我在沙发上做爱

1177
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:40,010
那两个芭辣助手快要来了
Joel. The eraser guys are coming here,

1178
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:44,350
你带我走 去不属于我的地方
so what if you took me someplace else....

1179
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:46,220
somewhere where I don't belong, and we hide there till morning?

1180
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,240
我们在那里躲到天亮

1181
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:55,450
我的每段记忆里都有你
I can't remember anything without you.

1182
00:59:56,370 --> 00:59:57,760
我好感动，但请你想想看
That's very sweet, but try.

1183
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:59,180
好吧
Okay.

1184
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:05,500
Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream...

1185
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:11,480
merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.

1186
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,380
“船儿划呀划”

1187
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,770
“缓缓顺流而下”

1188
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:16,540
“好快乐呀，可惜人生如梦”

1189
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:26,490
成功了
It's working!

1190
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:28,930
我是天才
I'm a genius!

1191
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:52,900
乔尔？
Joel.

1192
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,680
乔尔？
Joel.

1193
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,020
你在哪里？
Where did you go?

1194
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,620
我也要一起去
I'm supposed to come, too!

1195
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:02,320
我要去拿沙拉碗
I'll get a salad bowl.

1196
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:03,720
帮我搅拌汤，顺便看着乔尔
Can you stir the soup and keep an eye on ?

1197
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:04,410
好啊
He just likes to be near me.

1198
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:05,430
他喜欢黏着我
Absolutely.

1199
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:07,480
好，没问题

1200
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:08,490
克蕾婷？
It worked. My God!

1201
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:10,020
成功了

1202
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,410
天哪!你看!
Look at this! It worked!

1203
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:14,470
成功了
Look at this dress!

1204
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:16,630
你看看这件衣服

1205
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:20,000
天哪，真希望我可以带走
I wish I could take it with me.

1206
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:23,270
我是谁？
Hey, who am I?

1207
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:24,390
汉林太太
Mrs. Hamlyn.

1208
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:25,500
对，汉林太太
Right. Mrs. Hamlyn.

1209
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,170
我才四岁
I must be about four.

1210
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:28,320
天哪
Oh, my gosh.

1211
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:29,670
找到沙拉碗了
Found the salad bowl,

1212
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:31,730
我要准备沙拉和四季豆
so I'm serving salad and string beans.

1213
01:01:31,870 --> 01:01:33,190
他还好吧？
Is he okay under there?

1214
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:33,980
甜心，你好不好？
Honey, are you alright?

1215
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:34,820
天哪
Would you hate me if I asked you to clean some string beans?

1216
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:36,880
我真想打扫一整天

1217
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:39,760
你能不能帮我洗四季豆？

1218
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:41,330
没问题
not at all.

1219
01:01:41,470 --> 01:01:43,420
天哪，我好喜欢这间厨房
I love this kitchen.

1220
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,190
谢谢你
Thank you so much.

1221
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:46,890
她没在看我
She's not looking at me.

1222
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,010
这…
She's busy.

1223
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:49,780
她在忙，根本没在看我
no one ever looks at me.

1224
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,940
从来没人看着我

1225
01:01:52,090 --> 01:01:53,890
我要妈妈
I want my mommy.

1226
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:55,210
乔尔宝贝
Oh, baby Joel.

1227
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:56,600
乔尔…
Is every little peanut under there okay?

1228
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:58,760
小宝贝还好吧？

1229
01:01:58,900 --> 01:01:59,770
他很好
He's fine.

1230
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:01,270
你有没有喝的？
Do you have something to drink?

1231
01:02:01,410 --> 01:02:02,960
这么早喝鸡尾酒可以吗？
Could you drink a cocktail at this hour?

1232
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:04,020
我知道还不到五点
I know it's not five, but --

1233
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,470
可是我好想喝伏特加
I would die for a vodka.

1234
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:06,560
我去找找看
Let me check if I have that.

1235
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:08,470
好，我在这里等你
Okay.

1236
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:10,630
乔尔，不行
I'm just going to wait right here.

1237
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:11,670
乔尔？
no, sweetie.

1238
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:13,830
不行，你妈要我看着你
Joel?

1239
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:13,630
Your mother wants me to mind you.

1240
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:15,320
回去桌子底下
Get back under the table.

1241
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:16,120
冰淇淋…
Ice cream.

1242
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:19,910
不行，吃完晚饭才能吃
not until after you've had your dinner.

1243
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:21,900
别闹了，乔尔
Come on! Grow up.

1244
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:23,640
别孩子气了
Don't leave me, Clem.

1245
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:25,730
别离开我，天哪
Oh, my God.

1246
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:26,660
没有，我在这里
This is sort of warped.

1247
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:27,880
有点变态

1248
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:29,310
我害怕
I'm scared.

1249
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:30,550
我要妈妈
I want my mommy!

1250
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,290
别哭了，乔尔宝贝
Don't cry, baby Joel.

1251
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,800
乔尔宝贝，没事
It's okay.

1252
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:34,430
乔尔？
Joel! Stop it! I think it's working.

1253
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:36,020
乔尔？

1254
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:37,410
乔尔!别闹了!

1255
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:38,660
好像有用了，你看
We're hidden, Joel. Look!

1256
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:39,320
我们躲起来了

1257
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:41,830
你看

1258
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:45,450
等一下
Wait there.

1259
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:49,830
你看我的下体
My crotch is still here, just as you remembered it.

1260
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:51,400
和你记忆中一样

1261
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:53,690
好恶

1262
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:58,500
停下来了
It stopped.

1263
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,240
什么？
What?

1264
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:02,710
停止消除记忆了
It stopped erasing.

1265
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:04,350
糟糕
Oh, shit! This is terrible.

1266
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:06,710
大事不妙了

1267
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:10,280
他偏离蓝图了
He's off the map.

1268
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:10,980
他偏离蓝图了
Where?

1269
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:11,640
哪里？
I don't know where!

1270
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:12,820
我不知道

1271
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:14,780
我不知道哪里

1272
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:17,590
糟糕，大事不妙了
This is very bad news.

1273
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:19,330
我的眼镜呢？
Where are my glasses?

1274
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:20,660
好吧
Crap! What did we do?

1275
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,300
死定了

1276
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:23,790
现在怎么办？

1277
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:24,770
现在怎么办？
What shall we do?

1278
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:25,740
我们该怎么办？
I don't know what to do.

1279
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:27,240
我不知道怎么办

1280
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:27,930
我们该怎么办？
What shall we do?

1281
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,180
完蛋了，我不知道
I just said I don't know.

1282
01:03:29,330 --> 01:03:30,610
我刚才说了不知道怎么办
I'm sorry.

1283
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:31,860
对不起，我们怎么办？
What shall we do?

1284
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:32,910
我不知道
I don't know. Mellow out.

1285
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:33,950
放轻松，你弄得我很紧张
You're freaking me out.

1286
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:35,650
我们…

1287
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,050
快想办法
We have to do something.

1288
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,900
好吧 他醒来后可能会大脑受损
He could wake up all half-baked.

1289
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,180
安静点，你弄得我很紧张
Quiet. You're freaking me out.

1290
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:43,030
狼狈不堪
All gooey and half-baked.

1291
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:43,720
大脑又烤熟了
That sounds so good. I'm hungry.

1292
01:03:43,870 --> 01:03:44,770
好吧

1293
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:45,890
好像不错

1294
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:46,680
可恶!

1295
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:47,520
我饿了
Oh, shit. What? What?

1296
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:49,540
可恶

1297
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:52,420
怎样…

1298
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:53,510
打电话给霍华
We should call Howard!

1299
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:55,340
不行，我自己就能搞定
no! I can handle this.

1300
01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:57,470
你不能打电话给霍华

1301
01:03:57,610 --> 01:04:00,980
他大脑受损了
You can't call Howard.

1302
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:02,550
没时间让你胡闹
There's no time to fuck around.

1303
01:04:02,690 --> 01:04:04,320
我应付得来，你少胡说了
I've got this under control.

1304
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:06,310
别胡闹了
What are you talking about? Stop fucking around!

1305
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:08,220
好，我打电话给霍华
Okay. I'll call Howard.

1306
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:16,740
喂？
Hello?

1307
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:17,790
霍华吗？
Howard? It's Stan.

1308
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:19,070
我是史丹
I'm working on this guy down here...

1309
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:21,850
我来替这砘锵除记忆

1310
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,190
刚才有点不太对颈
and we seem to have lost him for a moment.

1311
01:04:24,330 --> 01:04:25,960
我叫不醒他了
And I can't bring him back up.

1312
01:04:26,110 --> 01:04:26,970
好吧
Tell me what happened before he disappeared.

1313
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,410
告诉我事情出错之前出了什么事

1314
01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:32,470
我不太确定，因为我暂时离开
I wasn't sure because I was away from the monitor for a minute...

1315
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:36,470
我让机器自动执行，因为我要…
and I had it on auto-pilot because I had to pee.

1316
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:37,130
我要去尿尿
Where was Patrick?

1317
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:38,490
派屈克呢？
Patrick? He had to go home sick

1318
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:39,430
派屈克？

1319
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:41,380
派屈克不舒服回家去了

1320
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:45,550
天哪，地址给我

1321
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:46,560
我知道，真对不起
What's the address?

1322
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:47,990
没关系，快说吧
I'm so sorry.

1323
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:49,720
这里是南村路159号
I'm at 1 59 South Village.

1324
01:04:49,870 --> 01:04:50,380
好
Apartment 1-F.

1325
01:04:50,530 --> 01:04:53,240
洛克维尔中心1E公寓

1326
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:53,870
玛丽？
Rockville Center.

1327
01:04:54,010 --> 01:04:54,430
什么事？
Mary? He's coming right now.

1328
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:56,160
他马上过来

1329
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:57,900
我留下来
I'm staying.

1330
01:04:58,050 --> 01:04:58,880
快去收拾东西
Get your stuff. I see.

1331
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,520
我要留下来

1332
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:02,080
你先走吧
I think you should go.

1333
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:02,870
才不要
no.

1334
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:05,070
玛丽…

1335
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,650
我吸了大麻
I am so stoned.

1336
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,920
拜托你快走吧
Please, you have to go.

1337
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:13,490
别再吸大麻了

1338
01:05:13,630 --> 01:05:16,690
我不想让他看到吸了大麻的我
I don't want him to see me stoned.

1339
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:18,710
我们惹了天大的麻烦，若霍华…
You have no idea how much trouble we'd get into if Howard comes -

1340
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:20,240
可恶，我好狼狈

1341
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:24,420
乔尔，住手!你看!乔尔!
Joel, stop! Look!

1342
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:30,260
乔尔!
I want her to pick me up.

1343
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:31,900
叫她来接我
It's weird how strong that desire is.

1344
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,280
那种欲望强烈得很诡异

1345
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:35,930
乔尔!看着我，快看
Look at me!

1346
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:38,610
你明天早上会记得我
You'll remember me in the morning...

1347
01:05:38,750 --> 01:05:40,310
你会来找我 谈我们的事，我们重新开始
and you'll come to me,

1348
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:41,560
派特？
and you'll tell me about us, and we'll start over.

1349
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:43,170
我刚才…派特？
Pat? I thought we could have a little cocktail.

1350
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:45,490
不是要喝鸡尾酒吗？

1351
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:48,760
那个派屈克在假冒我
That Patrick guy, he's copying me.

1352
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:50,120
哪个派屈克？
What Patrick guy?

1353
01:05:50,270 --> 01:05:50,920
那砘!
That guy! He's here.

1354
01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:51,690
什么？

1355
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:52,870
他来过了
In my apartment.

1356
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:53,950
在我的住处
One of the eraser guys.

1357
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:55,560
他是芭辣助手之一

1358
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:57,430
在替你消除记忆时爱上了你
He fell for you when they were doing you,

1359
01:05:57,580 --> 01:06:01,500
现在他假装不认识你
and now he's...introduced himself like he doesn't know you

1360
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:02,710
你们在交往
and you guys are dating.

1361
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:04,110
真的吗？
Really? Is he cute?

1362
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:07,240
他帅不帅？

1363
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:10,270
你没什么不对颈
There's nothing wrong with you.

1364
01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:13,460
你是我见过最好的女孩
You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.

1365
01:06:13,610 --> 01:06:15,730
你很善良
You're kind and beautiful and smart...

1366
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:18,450
人长得漂亮

1367
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:21,710
又聪明风趣
and funny and nice.

1368
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:24,250
人很好

1369
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:25,990
什么？
What?!

1370
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:28,010
好吧
Okay.

1371
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,510
好吧

1372
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:34,620
走啊…快点
Move! Come on, let's go!

1373
01:06:34,770 --> 01:06:35,380
小心点

1374
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:36,780
我们走!

1375
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:40,920
天哪，我还没清醒
I'm still stoned.

1376
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:43,840
你给我的眼药水没啥屁用
Those eyedrops you gave me didn't do shit.

1377
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:50,770
别激动
Be cool.

1378
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:55,950
玛丽，你怎么来了？
Hello, Mary. What are you doing here?

1379
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:58,240
霍华，她只是来帮忙
Hi, Howard. She was just here to help out.

1380
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:02,000
我想深入了解整个流程
I wanted to understand as much about the procedure as possible.

1381
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:06,800
我有必要搞清楚 整个工作内容
I think it's important for my job to understand the inner workings of...

1382
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:15,120
不是我的工作，而是同事的工作
the work that we do.

1383
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:10,790
Well, not that I do, but the work that is done...

1384
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:13,190
by people where I also work

1385
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:15,210
The work of my colleagues.

1386
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:20,720
好，先看看有没有办法可以解决
Let's see if we can get to the bottom of this, shall we?

1387
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:21,730
好的

1388
01:07:25,530 --> 01:07:26,220
奇怪了
That's odd.

1389
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:27,610
已经试过了
Already tried that.

1390
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:28,890
有没有试过C路径？
You tried going through the C-gate?

1391
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,470
当然有
Of course.

1392
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,670
我是说…有啊
I mean yes.

1393
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:36,550
好吧

1394
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:39,230
好了
Alright.

1395
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:42,570
你要连线吗？
You want to get linked up?

1396
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:43,300
对

1397
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:44,730
好的

1398
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,620
我启动了应用程式
I already ran the utility programs, and I have nothing there...

1399
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:50,190
结果没用

1400
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:54,050
于是我检查与资料不符的记忆
so I checked all the memories against the printed logs.

1401
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,230
好吧
Here, Howard.

1402
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:56,140
霍华，这把椅子给你坐
I got you a chair. Thank you.

1403
01:07:56,290 --> 01:07:56,870
谢谢你
You're welcome.

1404
01:07:57,020 --> 01:07:58,120
坐吧
Alright.

1405
01:07:58,270 --> 01:07:59,580
不客气

1406
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:02,510
好，我来处理
I've got it.

1407
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:04,730
我要浏览整个记忆
I'm going through the entire memory, see if something comes up.

1408
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,990
看看有没有蛛丝马迹

1409
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:15,690
我喜欢泡在水槽里洗澡
I love being bathed in the sink

1410
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:18,310
很有安全感
Such a feeling of security.

1411
01:08:18,450 --> 01:08:21,440
我没看过你这么开心
I've never seen you happier, Baby Joel.

1412
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:23,210
找到了
There it is.

1413
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:27,520
我不懂怎么会偏离蓝图这么多
I don't understand why it's off the map like that.

1414
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:32,290
他在搞什么鬼？
What was he doing there?

1415
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:41,130
他睁开眼睛了
His eyes are open.

1416
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:44,780
之前有这样吗？
Has this happened before with him?

1417
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,450
没有
no.

1418
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:49,890
情况不太妙
This is not good.

1419
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:53,330
我要…

1420
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:54,940
先给他打一针
I'm going to have to give him this.

1421
01:09:19,470 --> 01:09:22,880
安东，你看不出来我爱你吗？
Can't you see I love you, Antoine?

1422
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:24,860
好，恢复正常了
Okay. We're back in.

1423
01:09:26,950 --> 01:09:28,830
看着霍华真是赏心悦目
That was beautiful to watch Howard, like a surgeon or a concert pianist.

1424
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:33,560
好像外科医生或在演奏的钢琴家

1425
01:09:34,190 --> 01:09:35,510
谢谢你，玛丽
Thank you, Mary.

1426
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:40,000
霍华，去睡一下，我应该搞得定
Howard, you should get some sleep.

1427
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,080
I think I'll be fine now.

1428
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:44,660
安东，你看不出来我爱你吗？
Can't you see I love you, Antoine?

1429
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:48,140
我好幸运，亲一个
Lucky me. Lay one on me.

1430
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:54,400
别叫我安东
Don't call me Antoine.

1431
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:55,680
我叫沃利
My name is Wally.

1432
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:56,620
我知道
Yes, I know,

1433
01:09:56,770 --> 01:09:57,910
但怎么会有女人
but how can a woman love a man with a name like Wally?

1434
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:00,170
爱上叫沃利的男人？
Oh! What was that?

1435
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,090
什么声音？

1436
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:04,630
天哪，有人从你屁股跑出来
My God, there's people coming out of your butt.

1437
01:10:04,770 --> 01:10:06,430
真的吗？
There is?

1438
01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:09,530
好了
Got it.

1439
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,230
橘子妹!
Tangerine! Come on.

1440
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,150
乔尔，你在干嘛？

1441
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:15,130
我们快走
We've got to go.

1442
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:18,270
快点，跟我走，求求你快走
Go on. Please go.

1443
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:22,120
你跑得了一时，躲不了一世
You can run, but you can't hide.

1444
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:23,520
克蕾婷，快点!
Clem, come on! There I am.

1445
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:27,200
在那里

1446
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:28,280
卡车
Doc?

1447
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:29,600
医生？

1448
01:10:30,410 --> 01:10:31,520
求求你
Please?

1449
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:34,300
好吧，先告诉我…
Let's begin by telling me everything you remember -

1450
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:38,270
你记得的每一件事…

1451
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:42,830
好奇怪，他在回忆我们消除的事
That's strange.

1452
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:42,080
He's in a memory we've already eased.

1453
01:10:42,970 --> 01:10:45,550
至少我们知道他在想什么
At least we know where he is.

1454
01:10:45,690 --> 01:10:47,560
他回归轨道了
He's back on track, right?

1455
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:48,210
走吧
Come on, Clem.

1456
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,200
他好像在抗拒整个流程
Seems he's developed some sort of resistance to the procedure.

1457
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:52,740
不要，我不想再跑了
I don't want to run any more.

1458
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:54,790
可恶!
Shit!

1459
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:57,060
快点…
Come on...

1460
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,740
把我藏在地底下埋起来
Hide me somewhere deeper, somewhere really buried.

1461
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:00,570
哪里？
Where?

1462
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:03,250
藏在你的羞耻里
Hide me in your humiliation.

1463
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:04,470
羞耻
Come on, you big baby.

1464
01:11:04,610 --> 01:11:06,240
来啊，乳臭未干的小子

1465
01:11:06,390 --> 01:11:07,600
对不起

1466
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:10,320
我送你回家

1467
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:17,170
不!
no!!

1468
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:18,280
再见了，霍华
Bye, Howard.

1469
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:20,120
霍华，等一下!

1470
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,390
他又出状况了
Wait! He's disappeared again.

1471
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,750
天哪
Oh, dear.

1472
01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:27,740
我很遗憾，霍华
I'm so sorry.

1473
01:11:27,890 --> 01:11:29,480
羞耻
Humiliation.

1474
01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:32,750
羞耻

1475
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:33,620
乔尔
Joel.

1476
01:11:33,770 --> 01:11:35,820
羞耻

1477
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:37,390
我也不喜欢
I don't like it either.

1478
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:39,670
只是想找出可怕的藏匿所…
I'm just trying to find horrible secret places to -

1479
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:41,840
乔尔，我要给你一个惊喜
Honey, I have a surprise.

1480
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:43,260
我…
You know what? I'll just ask you in the morning.

1481
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:46,560
这样吧，我明天早上再问你

1482
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:48,410
晚安
Goodnight.

1483
01:11:50,290 --> 01:11:51,610
不，对不起，乔尔
I'm sorry Joel. Shut up.

1484
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:52,890
乔尔

1485
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,440
闭嘴 乔尔!

1486
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:58,320
乔尔，你看
Joel, look where we are!

1487
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:00,310
看什么？

1488
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:02,920
你看这是哪里

1489
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:07,550
克蕾婷，这样不好
This isn't good.

1490
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:08,830
把我藏起来
Hide me somewhere really buried.

1491
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:11,270
埋在地底下

1492
01:12:12,110 --> 01:12:14,710
快打啊…
Hit it, Joel!

1493
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:17,110
不行，我要回家了
I can't. I've got to go home.

1494
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:19,440
待会儿再说
I'll do it later!

1495
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:39,450
他有女朋友
He has a girlfriend.

1496
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:41,610
等一下，我在干嘛？ 男生爱女生
What am I doing?

1497
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:44,560
弗瑞迪，你再也吓唬不了我
Freddy, you don't scare me anymore!

1498
01:12:46,170 --> 01:12:47,070
乔尔
Joel, get up.

1499
01:12:47,210 --> 01:12:48,190
乔尔，快起来
Come on. They're not worth it.

1500
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:49,750
快点，不值得这样

1501
01:12:49,890 --> 01:12:52,250
他们不值得你这样
He's not listening! Come on.

1502
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,240
他没在听

1503
01:12:54,380 --> 01:12:55,140
快点啊
Stupid!

1504
01:12:55,290 --> 01:12:56,740
笨蛋!

1505
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,670
我好丢脸
I'm so ashamed.

1506
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:07,940
没关系，你还小嘛
It's okay.

1507
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:08,100
You were a little kid.

1508
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:08,570
对啊
Come on.

1509
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:09,650
走吧
That's where I live - lived.

1510
01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:11,980
我住这里…以前啦

1511
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,550
真希望我小时候就认识你
I wish I knew you when I was a kid.

1512
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:15,080
你喜欢我的粉红帽吗？
Do you like my pink hat?

1513
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:16,020
给你，舒服多了
Look, feel better.

1514
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:18,030
这次你可以杀了我，轮到我了
You can really kill me this time. Go.

1515
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:19,110
来吧，一、二、三
You're really going to die, though, right?

1516
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:20,230
可以吗？你真的会死吧？

1517
01:13:20,370 --> 01:13:21,020
好吧
One two three...

1518
01:13:21,170 --> 01:13:23,010
一、二、三

1519
01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:24,610
你死了
You're dead.

1520
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:26,870
我妈妈
Oh, my mom.

1521
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:27,770
没事，我们在闹着玩
It's okay!

1522
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,070
嗨，乔尔的妈妈 不是真的
We're playing.

1523
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:32,020
他要杀了我
It's not real. He's killing me.

1524
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:33,410
你死了吗？
Are you dead yet?

1525
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:35,360
你死了
You're dead!

1526
01:13:36,170 --> 01:13:38,940
应该没问题了，我还是不明白
I think I got the hang of this.

1527
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:39,000
I still don't understand it...

1528
01:13:39,090 --> 01:13:41,690
但快要找到他了
but I'm finding him quickly enough.

1529
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:56,340
克蕾婷!

1530
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:59,330
克蕾…

1531
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:01,490
克蕾婷!

1532
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:18,750
乔尔？
Joel.

1533
01:14:18,890 --> 01:14:20,730
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

1534
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:22,010
乔尔？
Joel...

1535
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:24,590
乔尔？

1536
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:26,880
天哪，你好过份
Oh my God, that was terrible.

1537
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:27,520
好了啦
Almost three seconds. Alright.

1538
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:28,310
将近三秒钟

1539
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:30,640
好，再让我试一次
Let me be it one more time..

1540
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:31,730
再试一次我就要走了
One more, then I get to go.

1541
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:33,400
好

1542
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:35,130
可恶!

1543
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:47,720
酷毙了!
Oh, shit!

1544
01:14:47,870 --> 01:14:50,160
好酷，小心点!
This is so cool!

1545
01:14:47,990 --> 01:14:49,690
Look out!

1546
01:14:51,890 --> 01:14:53,390
It's fluff!.

1547
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:55,410
好软哦!

1548
01:14:56,670 --> 01:14:58,100
我们的房子!
Our house!

1549
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:02,230
走吧

1550
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:04,290
等一下，我们该走了
We've got to go!

1551
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:08,150
来嘛
Come on!

1552
01:15:10,170 --> 01:15:11,560
我们该走了，克蕾婷
Clem, we've got to go.

1553
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:13,020
我们该走了

1554
01:15:15,150 --> 01:15:16,640
真是的!快点! 好耶
This is a really bad time for this!

1555
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:18,660
现在不是闹着玩的时候

1556
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,980
好恶心，天哪

1557
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:22,970
我连要去哪里都不知道
I don't even know where we're going.

1558
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,430
一定很好玩，走吧
It's going to be fun.

1559
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:26,270
那里很好玩，不对，走这边
It's the best place - this way. no, this way.

1560
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:27,110
不对，是这边
This way. Come on.

1561
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:28,850
不…走这边，快点

1562
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:29,580
不对…
You're no help at all.

1563
01:15:29,730 --> 01:15:31,350
你在帮倒忙

1564
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:34,000
快走…
Come on.

1565
01:15:35,050 --> 01:15:36,510
放开我!
Let go of me, Joel!

1566
01:15:50,330 --> 01:15:52,900
我喜欢看你工作，霍华
I like watching you work, Howard.

1567
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:58,040
我想…
I guess I'll go out for some air.

1568
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:00,420
我想出去…

1569
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:01,630
透透气
If nobody minds.

1570
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:03,360
希望你们不介意

1571
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:06,260
情况好像控制下来了
It looks like you have everything under control here.

1572
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:08,560
对，确实…

1573
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:10,360
没事了
That's fine.

1574
01:16:21,190 --> 01:16:23,030
你喜欢引经据典吗？
Do you like quotes?

1575
01:16:24,910 --> 01:16:25,940
什么意思？
What do you mean?

1576
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:27,340
就是…
Famous quotes.

1577
01:16:27,490 --> 01:16:29,220
引用名人的话

1578
01:16:29,370 --> 01:16:31,550
我觉得很有启发性
I find reading them inspirational...

1579
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:33,230
我在看书时…
and I've come across some I thought you might like, too.

1580
01:16:33,370 --> 01:16:36,070
找到了一些你可能会喜欢的句子

1581
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:39,550
说来听听
I'd love to hear some.

1582
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:40,910
有一句话是说…
Blessed are the forgetful,

1583
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:42,160
祝福健忘的人
for they get the better even of their blunders.

1584
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:44,740
因为忘记错误会过得比较好

1585
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:46,450
尼采说的？
That's nietzsche, right?

1586
01:16:46,590 --> 01:16:47,420
对
Yeah. And I thought I could tell you something you didn't know.

1587
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:49,260
我可以说些你不知道的

1588
01:16:49,410 --> 01:16:52,040
没关系，这句话很好
It's a good quote.

1589
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:53,680
很高兴我们都听过
I'm happy we both know it.

1590
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:55,280
是啊

1591
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:56,950
还有一段我也很喜欢
There's this other one I like.

1592
01:16:57,090 --> 01:16:59,490
亚历山大波普说的…
It's by Pope Alexander, and it goes -

1593
01:16:59,630 --> 01:17:00,990
亚历山大波普？
Alexander Pope?

1594
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:03,530
对了，真是的
Oh, yeah.

1595
01:17:03,670 --> 01:17:07,000
我想着别说出这个名字自讨没趣
Shit.

1596
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:07,000
It's just that I told myself not to say Pope Alexander ...

1597
01:17:07,150 --> 01:17:09,720
结果还是说出口了
and sound like a dope, and then I go ahead and say it.

1598
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:11,220
没关系啦
It's no big deal.

1599
01:17:11,290 --> 01:17:12,880
你真好
You're such a sweetheart.

1600
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:16,640
那句话是说…
The quote goes

1601
01:17:16,790 --> 01:17:20,050
“纯洁无辜的人太幸福了”
How happy is the blameless vestal's lot!

1602
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:22,940
“世人都健忘，遗忘了世人”
The world forgetting, by the world forgot:

1603
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:27,070
“纯净的心里有永恒的阳光”
Fternal sunshine of the spotless mind!

1604
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:30,490
“祷告都应验”
Fach prayer accepted and each wish resign'd.

1605
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:32,190
“愿望都得以偿”
I want to be a huge elephant.

1606
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:35,010
我想当一头超级大的…

1607
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:36,960
大象

1608
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:40,780
长着这么大的鼻子
With a huge trunk, like that.

1609
01:17:40,930 --> 01:17:42,430
克蕾婷？
Clementine?

1610
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:43,780
克蕾婷？
I haven't heard that one.

1611
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,450
那段话我没听过

1612
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:46,630
说得真好
It's lovely.

1613
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:49,660
我认为说得非常贴切
I just thought it would be appropriate, maybe.

1614
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:57,620
我很崇拜你的工作
I really admire the work you do

1615
01:17:58,190 --> 01:17:59,400
我不是故意要这么冒昧…
I don't mean to be so familiar -

1616
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:00,270
没关系
It's fine. I'm happy to hear -

1617
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:02,990
我喜欢听

1618
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:10,810
对不起
I'm sorry.

1619
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:17,250
我暗恋你很久了
I've loved you for a very long time.

1620
01:18:19,690 --> 01:18:21,080
我不应该说这种话的
I shouldn't have said that.

1621
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:25,040
没关系，你是个好女孩
Mary, you're a wonderful girl.

1622
01:18:25,190 --> 01:18:27,060
可是我…
But you know I have a wife and kids.

1623
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:31,800
我有妻小了，你也知道的

1624
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:33,980
玛丽
Mary.

1625
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:38,510
我们不能这样
Oh. Mary we can't do this.

1626
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:56,880
早安，莫兹维太太
Good morning, Mrs. Mierzwiak

1627
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:06,960
怎么了？
Oh my God. Who is it?

1628
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:07,620
天哪

1629
01:19:07,770 --> 01:19:08,800
是谁？

1630
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:24,530
史丹，多谢你的鸡婆
Thanks a lot, Stan.

1631
01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:30,800
荷莉丝!
Hollis!

1632
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:32,220
荷莉丝!

1633
01:19:32,790 --> 01:19:34,800
荷莉丝!
Hollis!

1634
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:37,720
等一下…荷莉丝？
Wait.

1635
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:39,400
我就知道，霍华
I knew it, Howard.

1636
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:42,240
刚开始不是这样，我是来工作的
It didn't start out like this.

1637
01:19:42,390 --> 01:19:43,290
莫兹维太太…
I came here to work!

1638
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:47,180
我是一时胡涂了 是真的，我是暗恋他的傻女孩
This is a one-time mistake.

1639
01:19:44,590 --> 01:19:46,460
it's true! I'm a stupid girl with a crush!

1640
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:50,390
他是被我逼得半推半就
I basically forced him into it!

1641
01:19:50,530 --> 01:19:53,760
你太过份了，快告诉她
Don't be a monster.

1642
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,700
Tell the girl.

1643
01:19:56,130 --> 01:19:57,450
告诉我什么？
Tell me what?

1644
01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:00,020
可怜的孩子
Oh, you poor kid.

1645
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:03,850
他是你的人了
You can have him.

1646
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,070
你们有过一段情
You did.

1647
01:20:15,690 --> 01:20:16,930
什么？
What?!

1648
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:29,250
我们有过一段情

1649
01:20:27,140 --> 01:20:29,150
We have a history.

1650
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:35,690
抱歉，是你想消除记忆的
I'm sorry.

1651
01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:35,550
You wanted the procedure done.

1652
01:20:35,830 --> 01:20:37,670
你想这么做
You wanted it done so you could get past...

1653
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:41,290
忘掉…

1654
01:20:46,650 --> 01:20:53,740
我要去办正事，天快亮了

1655
01:20:48,290 --> 01:20:51,210
I have to finish the work in there.

1656
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:53,370
It's almost morning.

1657
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:56,520
我们待会儿再谈
We'll talk later.

1658
01:20:57,890 --> 01:20:59,030
好吗？
Okay?

1659
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:19,560
我送你回家
Let me give you a lift home.

1660
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:32,050
天哪，讨厌死了

1661
01:21:32,190 --> 01:21:32,840
你好
Hi.

1662
01:21:32,990 --> 01:21:34,520
你好
Hi.

1663
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:38,730
我以为你不想再见到我了
Didn't figure you'd show your face around me again.

1664
01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:40,640
你可能觉得…
I thought you were humiliated.

1665
01:21:40,790 --> 01:21:41,820
很丢脸
You did run away, after all.

1666
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:44,370
你当场就跑掉了

1667
01:21:44,510 --> 01:21:46,530
我只是想见你一面 然后…
I just needed to see you, and...

1668
01:21:46,670 --> 01:21:48,400
怎样？

1669
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,420
我想…
I'd like to take you out or something.

1670
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,790
约你出去

1671
01:21:54,980 --> 01:21:56,190
你结婚了
You're married.

1672
01:21:57,210 --> 01:22:00,430
还没，没有结婚
not yet.

1673
01:21:58,570 --> 01:22:02,280
no, I'm not married.

1674
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:02,210
我没有结婚

1675
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:06,280
我直截了当告诉你，我很黏人
Look, I'm telling you right off the bat

1676
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:06,180
I'm high maintenance, so...

1677
01:22:06,430 --> 01:22:07,570
我不会…
I'm not gonna tiptoe around your marriage or...

1678
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:10,450
介入你的婚姻，不管你在想什么

1679
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:14,980
想和我在一起就别乱来
whatever it is you've got going there.

1680
01:22:12,070 --> 01:22:14,530
If you want to be with me, you're with me.

1681
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:16,470
好吧
Okay.

1682
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,430
太多男人把我概念化
Too many guys think I'm a concept, or I complete them, or...

1683
01:22:19,580 --> 01:22:21,940
要我让他们的人生圆满

1684
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,960
说我给他们活着的感觉
I'm gonna make them alive.

1685
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:26,950
我是个坏女孩，想求得心灵平静
I'm just a fucked-up girl who's... looking for my own peace of mind.

1686
01:22:27,090 --> 01:22:28,790
别把我当成你的
Don't assign me yours.

1687
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:31,540
我还记得那一段话
I remember that speech really well.

1688
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:33,690
我看穿你了，对吧？
I had you pegged, didn't I?

1689
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,030
你看穿了全人类
You had the whole human race pegged.

1690
01:22:36,170 --> 01:22:39,160
或许吧
Probably.

1691
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:42,050
我还是觉得你会救我一命
I still thought you were going to save my life.

1692
01:22:42,190 --> 01:22:44,030
即使经过了那件事
Fven after that.

1693
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:47,100
我知道
I know.

1694
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:53,350
若我们可以重新来过
It would be different if we could just give it another go-round.

1695
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:57,080
情况就会不一样了

1696
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:00,630
记住我
Remember me.

1697
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,380
尽你的全力
Try your best.

1698
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:09,120
或许我们能重新开始
Maybe we can.

1699
01:23:39,290 --> 01:23:42,800
好，告诉我你记得什么
Just tell me what you remember, and we'll take it from there.

1700
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:44,670
接着就交给我们吧

1701
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:46,440
好
Okay.

1702
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:49,830
我对你一见钟情
I liked you immediately.

1703
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:52,460
你对我没非份之想
You didn't come on to me at all.

1704
01:23:52,990 --> 01:23:55,110
我喜欢
I liked that.

1705
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:58,730
刚开始我跟你说话结结巴巴的
I was so tongue-tied around you at first.

1706
01:23:58,870 --> 01:24:01,720
但我想让你觉得我很聪明
But I wanted you to think I was smart.

1707
01:24:02,910 --> 01:24:05,060
我等不及想来上班
I couldn't wait to come to work

1708
01:24:05,210 --> 01:24:05,930
我幻想…
I had these fantasies of...

1709
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:10,800
我们结婚生子
us being married and having kids and just...

1710
01:24:12,830 --> 01:24:15,010
霍华，我办不到
Oh, Howie, I can't do this.

1711
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:17,730
我们说好了这样做最好
We agreed it's for the best, Mary.

1712
01:24:17,870 --> 01:24:19,370
我知道
I know.

1713
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:22,110
天哪
Oh, God!

1714
01:24:22,250 --> 01:24:23,190
我抬下面，你…
I'll take the bottom and you

1715
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:24,690
不行…来吧 我搬得动
Joel...help me with that.

1716
01:24:24,830 --> 01:24:25,480
乔尔，帮个忙

1717
01:24:25,630 --> 01:24:26,250
你要我搬吗？
Will you get the cooler?

1718
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:27,190
好，谢谢

1719
01:24:27,330 --> 01:24:28,540
你去搬冰箱 冰箱很…
She can get it.

1720
01:24:28,690 --> 01:24:31,050
这很轻吧？ 她搬得动…
Let me get that.

1721
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,630
我来搬，让我来搬，不…
no, no, no!

1722
01:24:33,770 --> 01:24:34,950
你别动
Don't take anything. I can take the plane.

1723
01:24:35,090 --> 01:24:35,990
我可以拿飞机
Put the gate back up.

1724
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:39,200
放下来，把门关好

1725
01:24:41,530 --> 01:24:43,780
这是我们刚认识那天
This is the day we met.

1726
01:24:43,930 --> 01:24:45,280
你在海边
You were down by the surf.

1727
01:24:45,430 --> 01:24:47,540
我从远处就看见了你
I could just make you out in the distance.

1728
01:24:47,690 --> 01:24:50,010
还记得当时就被你吸引了
I remember being drawn to you, even then.

1729
01:24:50,610 --> 01:24:51,890
我觉得好奇怪
I thought Wow. How odd.

1730
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:54,360
我爱上了你的背影
I'm drawn to someone's back

1731
01:24:54,990 --> 01:24:58,670
你穿着橘色衣服，那件你常穿
You were in that orange sweatshirt...

1732
01:24:56,770 --> 01:24:58,650
I would come to know so well.

1733
01:24:58,820 --> 01:25:00,620
最后我甚至讨厌它
And even hate, eventually.

1734
01:25:01,190 --> 01:25:02,020
但当时我心想…
But at the time I thought How cool, an orange sweatshirt.

1735
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:04,760
酷毙了，橘色的衣服耶

1736
01:25:04,910 --> 01:25:06,150
你好
Hi, there.

1737
01:25:08,390 --> 01:25:09,490
你好
Hi.

1738
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:12,600
我看到你坐在那里
I saw you sitting over here.

1739
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:14,160
自己一个人
By yourself.

1740
01:25:14,790 --> 01:25:16,000
我心想…
And I thought Thank God...

1741
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:17,560
谢天谢地
someone normal who doesn't know

1742
01:25:17,710 --> 01:25:22,790
总算有个正常人也不懂社交应对
how to interact at these things either.

1743
01:25:22,930 --> 01:25:26,050
我向来不太会说话
I don't ever know what to say.

1744
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:27,410
我叫克蕾婷
I'm Clementine.

1745
01:25:28,780 --> 01:25:31,930
能不能吃一块你的鸡肉？
Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?

1746
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:34,050
你就直接吃了
And then you just took it, without waiting for an answer.

1747
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:36,220
没等我同意

1748
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,720
好亲密
It was so intimate, like we were already lovers.

1749
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:46,340
仿佛我们已经是情侣了

1750
01:25:46,830 --> 01:25:48,360
我叫乔尔
I'm Joel.

1751
01:25:48,990 --> 01:25:50,270
嗨，乔尔
Hi, Joel.

1752
01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:52,840
别取笑我的名字
no jokes about my name.

1753
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:55,450
你是说…
Like Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin' Clementine?

1754
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:59,040
“亲爱的…亲爱的小柑橘”吗？

1755
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:01,020
那首卡通主题曲？
Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?

1756
01:26:01,450 --> 01:26:02,480
对 不会啦
Yeah. Like that.

1757
01:26:02,630 --> 01:26:03,700
就是那样
no, no jokes.

1758
01:26:03,850 --> 01:26:05,270
我不会取笑你的

1759
01:26:05,970 --> 01:26:07,810
我小时候最喜欢的
One of my favorite things

1760
01:26:07,950 --> 01:26:10,030
就是那个卡通的玩偶
when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll.

1761
01:26:13,410 --> 01:26:15,180
我觉得你的名字很奇妙
I think your name is magical.

1762
01:26:18,670 --> 01:26:20,260
到此为止
This is it, Joel.

1763
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:22,490
快要被消除了
It's gonna be gone soon.

1764
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:26,450
我知道
I know.

1765
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:29,590
现在怎么办？
What do we do?

1766
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:33,270
好好享受
Fnjoy it.

1767
01:26:50,990 --> 01:26:52,090
你结婚了吗？
You married?

1768
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:53,210
没有
no.

1769
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,340
我们搬过来住吧
Let's move into this neighborhood.

1770
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:58,570
但有人和我一起住
I do sort of live with someone, though.

1771
01:26:58,710 --> 01:27:00,030
男的女的？
Male or female?

1772
01:27:00,170 --> 01:27:00,720
什么？
What? Female.

1773
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:02,990
女的

1774
01:27:03,130 --> 01:27:04,560
女的

1775
01:27:06,330 --> 01:27:09,450
至少你不是同性恋
At least I'm not barking up the wrong tree.

1776
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:14,080
你认识这些人吗？
Do you know these people?

1777
01:27:14,610 --> 01:27:16,110
当然不认识，过来
Of course not. Come on.

1778
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:20,030
他们可能有养狗
They might have a dog.

1779
01:27:20,490 --> 01:27:21,990
没有狗啦
There's no dog.

1780
01:27:23,380 --> 01:27:24,870
你要干嘛？
What are you doing?

1781
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:26,950
外面好冷
It's freezing out.

1782
01:27:27,940 --> 01:27:29,110
我真不敢相信
I don't believe this.

1783
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:32,840
克蕾婷!

1784
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:34,370
进来

1785
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:44,600
过来，淹水也没关系
Come on. The water's fine.

1786
01:27:45,610 --> 01:27:48,240
今晚没人会来，相信我
nobody's coming here tonight, believe me.

1787
01:27:50,940 --> 01:27:51,970
好暗

1788
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:54,510
你…
So what's your girlfriend's name?

1789
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:57,020
你女朋友叫什么名字？

1790
01:27:57,750 --> 01:27:59,830
娜欧蜜，但我们不算是…
naomi, but we're not really...

1791
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:01,480
我们…

1792
01:28:01,620 --> 01:28:03,000
无所谓啦
Whatever.

1793
01:28:03,150 --> 01:28:05,510
这样好舒服，现在我想找…
So this is great.

1794
01:28:03,990 --> 01:28:05,580
now I can look for...

1795
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,870
蜡烛、火柴
candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.

1796
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:09,550
还有酒窖
Oh, God.

1797
01:28:09,690 --> 01:28:11,000
天哪

1798
01:28:17,730 --> 01:28:18,760
我们该走了
I think we should go.

1799
01:28:18,910 --> 01:28:20,120
电话不通
There's no phone line.

1800
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:21,790
你说什么？
What?

1801
01:28:21,930 --> 01:28:22,620
我们该走了
I think we should go.

1802
01:28:22,770 --> 01:28:23,600
为什么？
Why? It's our house.

1803
01:28:23,740 --> 01:28:25,440
这是我们的房子

1804
01:28:25,590 --> 01:28:26,660
只过一夜嘛
Just for tonight.

1805
01:28:26,810 --> 01:28:30,970
我们是大卫与露丝拉斯金夫妇
We are...David and Ruth Laskin!

1806
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:33,030
你想当哪一个？
Which one...do you want to be?

1807
01:28:33,170 --> 01:28:34,450
我比较想当露丝
I prefer to be Ruth, but I can be flexible.

1808
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:36,370
但都可以啦

1809
01:28:38,770 --> 01:28:39,840
你要什么？
What do you need?

1810
01:28:41,730 --> 01:28:43,230
酒
Alcohol.

1811
01:28:43,780 --> 01:28:44,920
天哪
So, are you okay with wine?

1812
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:48,030
你喝不喝葡萄酒？ 我不知道

1813
01:28:48,170 --> 01:28:49,140
你来挑选葡萄酒
I don't know...

1814
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:52,510
我去找卧房，打扮成…
Well, you choose the wine.

1815
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:53,910
I'll go find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth.

1816
01:28:52,970 --> 01:28:55,510
露丝

1817
01:28:57,180 --> 01:28:58,010
我现在没有露丝的感觉
I'm Ruth-less at the moment.

1818
01:28:58,150 --> 01:28:59,810
我们真的该走了

1819
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:04,580
我还得赶车
I've got to catch my ride.

1820
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:08,200
那就去吧
So go.

1821
01:29:09,110 --> 01:29:10,360
结果我走了
I did.

1822
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:13,380
我当你是个疯子
I thought maybe you were a nut.

1823
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:18,260
但你充满刺激感
But you were exciting.

1824
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:19,930
可惜你没留下来
I wish you'd stayed!

1825
01:29:20,070 --> 01:29:21,180
我也很后悔没留下来
I wish I'd stayed, too.

1826
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:22,880
现在好后悔
now I wish I'd stayed.

1827
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:24,830
我后悔很多事
I wish I'd done a lot of things.

1828
01:29:27,170 --> 01:29:30,430
天哪，真希望我…
I wish I'd stayed.

1829
01:29:32,420 --> 01:29:33,950
我好后悔没留下来

1830
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:35,450
真的
I do.

1831
01:29:35,590 --> 01:29:37,430
我下楼时你已经走了
I came back downstairs, and you were gone.

1832
01:29:37,570 --> 01:29:38,190
我走了
I walked out the door.

1833
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:40,000
我踏出了门外

1834
01:29:40,150 --> 01:29:40,660
为什么？
Why?

1835
01:29:40,810 --> 01:29:41,740
我不知道
I don't know.

1836
01:29:41,890 --> 01:29:43,130
我好像变成受惊的小孩
I felt like a scared little kid.

1837
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:46,860
我满脑子浆糊，什么都不知道
It was above my head. I don't know.

1838
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:47,870
你觉得害怕？
You were scared?

1839
01:29:48,010 --> 01:29:49,430
对

1840
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:52,900
我以为你早就知道了
Thought you knew that about me.

1841
01:29:54,340 --> 01:29:55,800
我跑回营火堆旁
I ran back to the bonfire,

1842
01:29:55,940 --> 01:29:58,520
大概是想摆脱羞耻感吧
trying to outrun my humiliation, I think

1843
01:29:59,070 --> 01:30:01,050
我是不是说错了什么？
Was it something I said?

1844
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:02,440
对
Yeah.

1845
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:06,030
你说“那就去吧”
You said So go with such disdain.

1846
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:08,570
用轻蔑的口气

1847
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:11,520
对不起
I'm sorry.

1848
01:30:11,670 --> 01:30:12,770
没关系啦
It's okay.

1849
01:30:18,140 --> 01:30:19,040
乔尔？
Joel.

1850
01:30:20,890 --> 01:30:22,420
若你这次留下来呢？
What if you stayed this time?

1851
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,250
我踏出了门外
I walked out the door.

1852
01:30:28,510 --> 01:30:30,040
记忆荡然无存了
There's no memory left.

1853
01:30:30,180 --> 01:30:32,160
至少回来说声再见吧
Come back and make up a goodbye, at least.

1854
01:30:33,450 --> 01:30:35,430
我们假装时光倒转
Let's pretend we had one.

1855
01:30:46,390 --> 01:30:47,920
再见了，乔尔
Bye, Joel.

1856
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,530
我爱你
I love you.

1857
01:30:51,090 --> 01:30:56,160
我们蒙托克见
Meet me in Montauk

1858
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:00,790
飞机不是我弄坏的
I didn't crash the plane.

1859
01:31:00,930 --> 01:31:03,960
它自己摔坏了，不是我弄的
The plane crashed.

1860
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:03,810
I didn't do it.

1861
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:07,160
你用遥控器操纵飞机
You were operating the plane with the remote control,

1862
01:31:06,570 --> 01:31:07,750
and it crashed.

1863
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:09,480
结果摔坏了
It was fucking windy. Come on.

1864
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:11,400
风太大了，别再碎碎念
You're stoned and you're driving.

1865
01:31:11,540 --> 01:31:13,690
你吸了大麻还开车
The pot balances it out and brings you back up.

1866
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:15,300
对，吸大麻能维持我们的关系
That's why I smoke it.

1867
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:18,040
让我迷迷糊糊，所以我才吸大麻 若要喝酒，不如吸大麻
If I'm going to be drinking, then

1868
01:31:16,070 --> 01:31:17,250
I'll smoke it.

1869
01:31:18,190 --> 01:31:19,780
真的啦，有医学研究
It does.

1870
01:31:19,930 --> 01:31:22,600
在科学网路上证实了
A medical test was done by the Science network

1871
01:31:22,750 --> 01:31:23,920
小心看路
Honey, just watch the road.

1872
01:31:24,070 --> 01:31:27,190
我什么也看不见
I can't see shit.

1873
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,060
我看到你在和美女搭讪
I saw you talking to somebody pretty.

1874
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:31,890
她人很好
She was nice.

1875
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:33,800
对，她是谁？
Who was it?

1876
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:38,610
她是…
She was just a girl.

1877
01:31:38,750 --> 01:31:40,000
就是普通的女孩嘛

1878
01:31:40,490 --> 01:31:43,480
你真的…

1879
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:48,450
好了

1880
01:32:25,410 --> 01:32:28,000
我先把车子停在路边
So I've got to drop the van off.

1881
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:30,410
谢谢你，史丹
Thanks, Stan.

1882
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,180
我们聊一聊
We'll talk

1883
01:33:58,210 --> 01:33:59,320
你的东西好多
You've got a lot of your stuff there. That's right.

1884
01:33:59,470 --> 01:34:00,230
对，我东西很多
I take it you're not coming back

1885
01:34:00,370 --> 01:34:01,900
我想你不会回来了

1886
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:04,790
我是为了你才回来的
I wouldn't come back if I was you.

1887
01:34:04,930 --> 01:34:05,830
你发誓毫不知情吗？
Do you swear you didn't know?

1888
01:34:05,970 --> 01:34:07,220
我发誓
I swear.

1889
01:34:08,410 --> 01:34:10,180
你没有消除记忆？
So you didn't do the erasing?

1890
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:11,460
当然没有，天地良心啊
Of course not.

1891
01:34:11,610 --> 01:34:14,310
你甚至没怀疑我们交往过？
And you never even suspected we were together?

1892
01:34:15,470 --> 01:34:17,580
可能有一次吧
Once, maybe.

1893
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:21,660
我下班回来，你在他车上
I was coming back from a job, and I saw you two talking.

1894
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:24,400
我看到你们俩在聊天

1895
01:34:24,550 --> 01:34:27,850
我向你挥手，你还笑了
So I waved to you, and you giggled.

1896
01:34:28,380 --> 01:34:29,970
我看起来怎样？
How did I look?

1897
01:34:31,820 --> 01:34:33,350
你看起来很开心
You looked happy.

1898
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:37,280
享受偷情的快感
Happy with a secret.

1899
01:34:37,770 --> 01:34:38,980
然后呢？
And after that?

1900
01:34:39,130 --> 01:34:41,240
我就没再撞见你们约会了
I never saw you two together again like that...

1901
01:34:41,390 --> 01:34:45,660
于是我以为是自己胡思乱想
so I just figured I was imagining things.

1902
01:35:11,420 --> 01:35:13,600
我很喜欢你，玛丽
I really like you, Mary Svevo.

1903
01:35:14,930 --> 01:35:16,210
你知道吗？
You know that?

1904
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:29,610
谢谢你
Thanks.

1905
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:04,470
我去拿牙刷
Let me get my toothbrush.

1906
01:36:04,610 --> 01:36:05,970
好

1907
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:22,320
克蕾婷，你在哪里？
Where are you, Clem?

1908
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:25,270
我好担心，你好像在生我的气
I'm worried.

1909
01:36:23,540 --> 01:36:29,740
I feel like you're mad at me and I don't know what I did.

1910
01:36:25,420 --> 01:36:28,090
不知道我做错了什么

1911
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:31,600
我做错了什么？我好爱你
I love you so much.

1912
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:34,280
我会不惜代价让你快乐
I'll do anything to make you happy.

1913
01:36:34,430 --> 01:36:37,000
你要我怎么做？我一定照办
Just tell me what you want me to do, and I'll do it.

1914
01:36:37,140 --> 01:36:43,190
我早上会过去确定你没事
I'm going to stop by this morning, just to make sure you're okay.

1915
01:36:54,190 --> 01:36:57,310
我们走吧
Vamonos, senor.

1916
01:36:57,460 --> 01:37:00,620
我昨晚玩得很愉快
I had a really nice time last night.

1917
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:02,220
愉快？
nice?

1918
01:37:02,370 --> 01:37:07,440
昨晚是我这辈子最快乐的时光
I had the best fucking night of my entire fucking life last night.

1919
01:37:07,590 --> 01:37:09,730
这才像话嘛
That's better.

1920
01:37:13,290 --> 01:37:14,160
好奇怪
This is weird.

1921
01:37:14,300 --> 01:37:16,870
给霍华莫兹维的所有病患…
To all patients of Doctor Howard Mierzwiak..

1922
01:37:17,010 --> 01:37:18,260
我叫玛丽
My name is Mary Svevo.

1923
01:37:18,410 --> 01:37:20,170
我们见过，但你们不记得我了 我任职于…
We've met, but you don't remember me.

1924
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:21,910
我们见过，但你们不记得我了
I worked for a company you hired to have part of your memory erased.

1925
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:23,970
我任职于你们委托消除记忆的… 我任职于你们委托

1926
01:37:24,110 --> 01:37:26,650
消除记忆的公司 后来我觉得这样做太可怕…
I've since decided that this is a horrible...

1927
01:37:26,790 --> 01:37:28,420
好像是什么广告吧

1928
01:37:28,570 --> 01:37:29,600
为了弥补罪过
To correct this,

1929
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:32,520
我要把档案还给你们
I'm sending everyone's file back to them.

1930
01:37:33,850 --> 01:37:36,360
我叫克蕾婷
My name is Clementine Kruscynski.

1931
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:39,520
我要消除对乔尔的记忆
I'm here to erase Joel Barish.

1932
01:37:39,660 --> 01:37:40,980
这是什么？
What is this?

1933
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:42,030
我不知道
I don't know.

1934
01:37:42,170 --> 01:37:43,340
他很无趣
He's boring.

1935
01:37:43,490 --> 01:37:46,120
这够理由消除对他的记忆吧？
Is that enough reason to erase someone?

1936
01:37:46,270 --> 01:37:48,980
我最近经常在想以前和现在的我
I've been thinking how I was before and how I am now, and he changed me.

1937
01:37:49,130 --> 01:37:50,370
他好像改变了我
I feel like I'm always pissy.

1938
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:52,430
我一天到晚都心情不好

1939
01:37:52,570 --> 01:37:54,030
我不喜欢和他在一起的自己
I don't like myself when I'm with him.

1940
01:37:54,170 --> 01:37:55,700
我已经不喜欢自己了

1941
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:58,060
光是看着他我就受不了
I can't stand to even look at him.

1942
01:37:58,210 --> 01:38:00,080
可悲、温吞又带着歉意的笑容
That pathetic, wimpy, apologetic smile.

1943
01:38:00,230 --> 01:38:02,620
好像受了伤的猫咪一样

1944
01:38:02,770 --> 01:38:03,670
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

1945
01:38:03,810 --> 01:38:05,230
我没在干嘛
I'm not doing anything.

1946
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:06,380
新鲜感已经消失了
The bloom is certainly off the rose at this point.

1947
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:07,630
你在耍我吗？
Are you screwing with me?

1948
01:38:07,780 --> 01:38:09,270
没有
no!

1949
01:38:09,410 --> 01:38:10,800
你真的在耍我
You are screwing with me.

1950
01:38:10,940 --> 01:38:11,590
我没有
I'm not!

1951
01:38:11,740 --> 01:38:12,880
你有
You clearly are!

1952
01:38:13,030 --> 01:38:13,680
我们…
Let's just take a minute and just...

1953
01:38:13,830 --> 01:38:17,060
先冷静一下，暂时…

1954
01:38:45,590 --> 01:38:46,770
派屈克，走开 甜心…
Patrick, get the fuck away!

1955
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:48,580
离我远一点!

1956
01:38:48,730 --> 01:38:49,450
什么？
Can we talk about it?

1957
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:50,210
能不能谈谈？
no! Get the fuck away!

1958
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:52,200
不行!你给我滚!

1959
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:26,680
乔尔贝里许…

1960
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:28,730
嗨，克蕾婷
Hey, Clementine.

1961
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:29,940
你好
Hey.

1962
01:39:30,090 --> 01:39:31,520
很高兴能见到你
nice to see you.

1963
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:33,460
是啊

1964
01:39:34,620 --> 01:39:36,070
是啊
Yes.

1965
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:37,910
…很有教养
...and she's smart, I think, but not educated.

1966
01:39:38,060 --> 01:39:42,060
我觉得她很聪明，可惜没教养

1967
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:44,600
没办法和她聊书的事
I couldn't talk to her about books.

1968
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:48,110
她比较喜欢看杂志
She's more of a magazine-reading girl.

1969
01:39:48,250 --> 01:39:51,590
她的字汇有待加强
Her vocabulary leaves something to be desired.

1970
01:39:51,730 --> 01:39:55,030
事实上我带她出去很丢脸 你好
The truth is, I was embarrassed in public...

1971
01:39:55,180 --> 01:39:56,350
因为她的发音…
because she would pronounce 'library' 'li-berry'.

1972
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:57,780
在发音上很不讲究

1973
01:39:57,930 --> 01:39:59,210
你好

1974
01:39:59,350 --> 01:40:00,740
“土”书馆

1975
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:02,620
你看我找到什么了

1976
01:40:03,570 --> 01:40:04,740
Look what I found.

1977
01:40:05,090 --> 01:40:07,600
若克蕾婷有吸引人之处
I think if there's a truly seductive quality about Clementine...

1978
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:14,340
就是她的个性保证不落俗套
it's that her personality promises to take you out of the mundane...

1979
01:40:14,490 --> 01:40:16,560
我看起来很瘦
Made me look skinny.

1980
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:18,520
像燃烧的陨石
...amazing, burning meteorite will carry you to another world,

1981
01:40:18,660 --> 01:40:20,610
带你到另一个世界

1982
01:40:20,750 --> 01:40:23,700
一个充满刺激的世界
where things are exciting.

1983
01:40:24,510 --> 01:40:26,380
但你很快就会发现
But what you quickly learn is that it's really an elaborate ruse.

1984
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:29,340
其实那是一个诡计

1985
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:32,710
很抱歉我对你大呼小叫
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1986
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:34,660
没关系
It's okay.

1987
01:40:35,540 --> 01:40:38,240
看得出来很矫揉做作

1988
01:40:38,390 --> 01:40:39,110
但还是很吸引人
I really like you.

1989
01:40:39,260 --> 01:40:42,450
我很喜欢你，不想对你恶言相向
I hate that I said mean things about you.

1990
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:44,370
我把收音机关掉
Let me turn this off.

1991
01:40:44,510 --> 01:40:46,730
这样才公平啊
Hey, that's only fair.

1992
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:53,760
至于她的头发，根本是乱来嘛

1993
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:53,800
The whole thing with the hair, it's all bullshit.

1994
01:40:53,910 --> 01:40:54,970
我喜欢你的头发
I really like your hair.

1995
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:56,370
真是太可悲了 谢谢你
Thank you.

1996
01:40:56,510 --> 01:40:57,690
我喜欢你的头发 谢谢你
I really like your hair. Thank you.

1997
01:40:57,840 --> 01:40:58,670
我是说真的
I do.

1998
01:40:58,810 --> 01:41:02,450
这个世界一片混乱 头发还染色，我是说…

1999
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:04,340
你要不要喝杯酒？
You want a drink or something?

2000
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:06,140
有没有威士忌？
Do you have any whiskey?

2001
01:41:07,610 --> 01:41:10,840
我觉得她做爱…
I didn't think her sex was motivated.

2002
01:41:11,510 --> 01:41:12,690
毫无动机
I saw it clearly the last night we were together.

2003
01:41:12,830 --> 01:41:15,430
我昨晚和她做爱时看透了

2004
01:41:15,580 --> 01:41:16,520
没挑逗感
It wasn't sexy.

2005
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:17,940
只是…
It was just...sad.

2006
01:41:18,090 --> 01:41:19,640
很悲哀

2007
01:41:20,210 --> 01:41:22,950
抱歉，我以为还有
Sorry, I thought there was more.

2008
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:25,910
克蕾婷觉得唯有和男人上床
The only way she can get people to like her is to fuck them.

2009
01:41:26,050 --> 01:41:28,860
对方才会喜欢她

2010
01:41:29,010 --> 01:41:32,760
至少她会当面挑逗男人的性欲
Or at least dangle the possibility of getting fucked in front of them.

2011
01:41:32,910 --> 01:41:37,500
她太饥渴了，又没安全感
I think she's so desperate and insecure...

2012
01:41:35,660 --> 01:41:40,600
that she'll sooner or later go around fucking everybody.

2013
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:40,590
早晚会和每个男人上床

2014
01:41:40,740 --> 01:41:41,800
我不做这种事
I don't do that.

2015
01:41:41,950 --> 01:41:44,310
我不觉得你会这样
I wouldn't think that about you.

2016
01:41:44,460 --> 01:41:45,150
因为我不是这种人
Because I don't.

2017
01:41:45,290 --> 01:41:46,950
我知道
I know.

2018
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:48,560
你那样说很伤我的心
It really hurts me that you said that, because I don't do that.

2019
01:41:48,700 --> 01:41:49,430
因为我不是那种人
I'm so sorry.

2020
01:41:49,570 --> 01:41:50,060
对不起

2021
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:52,490
我对这一切都很抱歉
I'm sorry about all this.

2022
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:56,450
我要走了，我有点困惑
I'm going to go.

2023
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:55,380
I'm a little confused.

2024
01:41:56,600 --> 01:41:58,820
我不想待在这里
I don't really think I can be here.

2025
01:42:05,130 --> 01:42:06,230
再见
Bye.

2026
01:42:06,380 --> 01:42:07,210
再见
Bye.

2027
01:42:07,350 --> 01:42:08,810
我以为自己够了解她
I really thought I knew her so well. It was nice meeting you.

2028
01:42:08,950 --> 01:42:13,020
很高兴能认识你
But I didn't know her at all.

2029
01:42:14,030 --> 01:42:17,920
但我一点也不了解她 和她相处了那么久的时间
What a loss to spend that much time with someone...

2030
01:42:18,070 --> 01:42:20,770
才发现不了解她，太可惜了
only to find out that she's a stranger.

2031
01:42:24,710 --> 01:42:25,990
等一下!
Wait!

2032
01:42:28,710 --> 01:42:29,200
怎样？
What?

2033
01:42:29,340 --> 01:42:31,140
不知道，就是想叫住你 你想干嘛？
I don't know. Just wait. What do you want, Joel?

2034
01:42:31,290 --> 01:42:32,780
先别走，我不知道
I want you to wait for... just a...while.

2035
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:34,030
只是希望你等…

2036
01:42:34,180 --> 01:42:35,310
先等…

2037
01:42:35,460 --> 01:42:37,120
等一下

2038
01:42:50,420 --> 01:42:51,670
好吧
Okay.

2039
01:42:51,820 --> 01:42:52,950
真的吗？
Really?

2040
01:42:53,490 --> 01:42:54,770
别把我概念化了
I'm not a concept, just a fucked-up girl looking for peace of mind.

2041
01:42:54,910 --> 01:42:57,340
我只是想求得心灵平静的坏女孩

2042
01:42:57,490 --> 01:42:58,730
我并不完美
I'm not perfect.

2043
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:01,830
我看不出来你有什么缺点 你会发现的
I can't see anything that I don't like about you right now.

2044
01:43:01,970 --> 01:43:04,190
现在看不出来 你会发现的
But you will think of things.

2045
01:43:04,340 --> 01:43:05,760
你会思考

2046
01:43:05,910 --> 01:43:07,960
我会觉得跟着你乏味又不自由
And I'll get bored with you...

2047
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:10,640
因为我就是那种人
and feel trapped, because that's what happens with me.

2048
01:43:11,580 --> 01:43:13,000
好吧
Okay.

2049
01:43:17,210 --> 01:43:18,350
好吧
Okay.

2050
01:43:23,090 --> 01:43:26,770
好吧 好吧
Okay. Okay.

2051
01:43:35,180 --> 01:43:37,410
Change your heart

2052
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:43,350
Look around you

2053
01:43:49,690 --> 01:43:52,090
Change your heart

2054
01:43:54,730 --> 01:43:57,860
It will astound you

2055
01:44:02,270 --> 01:44:06,070
Bow, I need your lovin'

2056
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:14,120
Like the sunshine

2057
01:44:16,730 --> 01:44:20,820
And everybody's gotta learn sometime

2058
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:27,990
Everybody's gotta learn sometime

2059
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:35,780
Everybody's gotta learn sometime

2060
01:44:35,850 --> 01:44:38,340
Mm-mm-mm

2061
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:54,530
Change your heart

2062
01:44:57,510 --> 01:45:00,670
And look aroundyou

2063
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:08,380
Change your heart

2064
01:45:11,690 --> 01:45:15,180
It will astoundyou

2065
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:23,160
I needyour lovin'

2066
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:31,140
Like the sunshine

2067
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:37,950
And everybody's gotta learn sometime

2068
01:45:40,990 --> 01:45:45,160
Everybody's gotta learn sometime

2069
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:52,830
Everybody's gotta learn sometime

2070
01:45:52,910 --> 01:45:55,900
Mm-mm-mm

2071
01:46:00,780 --> 01:46:04,770
Everybody's gotta learn sometime

2072
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:11,820
Everybody's gotta learn sometime

2073
01:46:14,930 --> 01:46:19,430
Everybody's gotta learn sometime

2074
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:22,410
Mm-mm-mm
