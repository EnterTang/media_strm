我不知道
I didn't know.

149
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:36,468
你想带个孩子在大篷车里过日子？
D'you expect us to carry on living in that caravan with a baby?

150
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,197
- 你好  梅布尔 - 你好  医生
Hello, Maybelle. - Hello, doctor.

151
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,407
我喜欢你的脸谱
I love your face.

152
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:37,036
- 你明天就能回家了 - 是的
You can go home tomorrow. - Yes!

153
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,956
很棒  对吧  但你几周后还得回来
Great, eh? But you have to come back in a few weeks.

154
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,742
- 就像我说的  好吗 - 好
Like I told you, eh? - Yes.

155
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:46,082
我们要看看化疗队长能不能打个胜仗
Then we can see if Captain Chemo won the fight.

156
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,667
谢谢你  医生
Thank you, doctor.

157
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,875
- 你画的是什么？- 老虎
What are you? - A tiger.

158
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,258
老虎
A tiger.

159
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:56,632
- 你妈妈画的是什么？- 蝴蝶
And what is Mummy? - A butterfly.

160
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,426
老虎会做什么
What do tigers do?

161
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,041
那是什么？
What's that?

162
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:29,584
你能听到吗  我听到有人在我们屋里
Can you hear what I can hear? There's someone in our house.

163
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:32,967
你敢去看一眼吗  我可不敢  去看看
Do you dare go and take a look? Cos I don't. Go and see.

164
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,211
你想去看看吗？
Are you going to go and see?

165
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,301
你看到了什么？
Well? Can you see anything?

166
00:21:42,796 --> 00:21:49,992
「在巨大森林里  今夜狮子睡着了」

167
00:21:49,992 --> 00:21:56,926
「在安静森林里  今夜狮子睡着了」

168
00:22:12,851 --> 00:22:19,269
「在平静村落附近  今夜狮子睡着了」

169
00:22:19,261 --> 00:22:26,581
「在安静村落附近  今夜狮子睡着了」

170
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:46,286
很高兴你回来了  欢迎回来
I'm so pleased you're back. - Welcome home.

171
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,315
这太美了
That's beautiful!

172
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,655
- 喜欢吗 - 是的
Do you like it? - Yes.

173
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,576
- 继续 - 什么？
Go on. - What?

174
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,241
继续
Carry on.

175
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:27,175
- 亲爱的 - 嗯？
Hey, darling. - Yeah?

176
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:31,346
在房子前建条长廊如何？
How about building a veranda onto the front of the house?

177
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:33,814
什么？长廊？
A what? A veranda?

178
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:37,523
长廊最没用了
There's nothing more useless than a veranda.

179
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:41,110
你不会坐在那的  你买了鞑靼牛排
You never sit in it. You bought some steak tartare.

180
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,866
- 但很棒  不是么 - 长廊是不错
But it'd be great, wouldn't it? - A veranda is great.

181
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:48,700
亲爱的  夏天热  你会待在外面
Oh, come on, sweetheart. In summer you go outside when it's hot

182
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:52,287
冬天冷  你又会待在火炉旁
and in winter you stay indoors by the stove.

183
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:56,329
但我们在比利时呀  外面坐着太冷了
But we live in Belgium, where it's a bit too cold to sit outside

184
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,543
屋里又太热
and a bit too hot to stay indoors.

185
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,925
你真的买了鞑靼牛排？
You really bought some steak tartare?

186
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:10,434
- 这不是鞑靼牛排 - 这是素食  不错吧
That's not steak tartare! - It's vegetarian. Nice, isn't it?

187
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,265
我的天啊
Bloody hell! Come on!

188
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:16,228
我不想吹到风  孩子也不想
I don't like sitting in the wind and neither does our baby.

189
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,693
所以这事儿定了  你要建个长廊
So it's decided, you need a veranda.

190
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:27,360
好  但这是最后一次你打那张牌了
OK, you'll get your veranda but this is the last time you use that argument.

191
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:31,330
- 谢谢 - 怎么  不就是个长廊么？
Thanks. - What? It's only a veranda.

192
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:36,703
- 是男孩还是女孩？ - 我只知道是个婴儿
Well? Do you know what it is yet? - A baby, I reckon.

193
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:42,508
但又不确定  迪迪埃有个马厩  也许是马驹
But I can't be sure. With Didier being such a stallion, it could be a foal.

194
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,395
糟了
Shit.

195
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,612
我的羊水破了
It's coming. My water has broken.

196
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,071
- 冷静点  坐下来 - 不要
Keep calm. Sit down. - No.

197
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,985
冷静点  冷静点
Keep calm, keep calm.

198
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,745
爱丽丝生了  是个女孩
Elise has had the baby. It's a girl.

199
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:17,831
对  孩子叫做…
Yes, it's really...

200
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,173
梅布尔  梅布尔
Maybelle. Maybelle.

201
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:24,425
就像梅布尔·卡特(美国女乡村音乐家)
Yes, like Maybelle Carter.

202
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,710
你什么都不知道
You know nothing about names!

203
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:33,175
不行  手放下来
No, no. Hands down.

204
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,101
那是什么？
What's that?

205
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,440
什么？
What?

206
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:48,403
- 那可不是长廊 - 对  那是排廊
That's not a veranda, sweetheart. - No... No, it's a "terranda".

207
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,911
就是排屋和长廊的结合
The perfect combination of a terrace and a veranda.

208
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:56,412
真好  真棒  谢谢
It's lovely. It's wonderful. Thank you.

209
00:26:56,907 --> 00:27:00,332
走  走
Go on. Go on. That's it!

210
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,497
走
Go on. That's it!

211
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,166
小心
Look. Oh, watch out...

212
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:12,966
「这是美国有史以来经历的最严重的恐怖袭击」
It is the worst terrorist attack ever experienced by the United States...

213
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:16,092
「我虽然行过死荫的幽谷  也不怕遭害」

214
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,449
「因为你与我同在」

215
00:27:18,392 --> 00:27:20,519
「我们不会忘记这一天」

216
00:27:21,376 --> 00:27:23,635
「我们继续前行  为自由而战」

217
00:27:24,277 --> 00:27:28,629
「为世界的一切美好和正义而战」

218
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:33,696
「谢谢  晚安  上帝保佑美国」

219
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,339
看  看
Look, look.

220
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,732
新年快乐
Happy New Year!

221
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:23,451
- 你也要做牛仔女郎？ - 对啊
Are you going to become a cowgirl too? - Yes.

222
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,746
爸爸
Daddy!

223
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:17,801
把它放下  梅布尔  给我  亲爱的
Put that down, Maybelle. Give it to me, sweetie.

224
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:25,009
别哭  给我  亲爱的
Don't cry. Give it to me, sweetie.

225
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:31,433
爸爸  为什么这只鸟死了？
Why is the birdie dead, Daddy?

226
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:37,109
亲爱的  这只鸟撞到了玻璃上
Well, sweetie... the birdie flew into the glass...

227
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,944
它不知道玻璃是什么
Birds don't know what glass is.

228
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:42,656
它们觉得如果自己能看穿
They think that if they can see through it,

229
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:46,197
就能飞过去  它们挺笨的是吧
they can fly through it. Not very clever of them, eh?

230
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:50,869
它死了会去哪？
Where does the birdie go when it's dead?

231
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:59,089
我们要把它扔了  好吗  梅布尔？
We... We just have to throw it away now. Eh, Maybelle?

232
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:03,551
我们不能拿它做堆肥  就像公鸡
We mustn't put it on the compost heap. It's like a chicken,

233
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,135
它有骨头
it's got bones in it.

234
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:08,427
我们必须把它扔到垃圾堆  好吗
We'll throw it in the dustbin. Come on.

235
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,311
不干  爸爸
No, Daddy.

236
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:14,391
亲爱的  这太脏了  给我好吗
It's dirty, darling. Give it to me, sweetie.

237
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:17,027
我替你扔掉  好吗
I'll throw it away for you, OK?

238
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,068
你想自己扔吗？
Do you want to throw it away?

239
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,819
给我  快点
Give it to me. Come on.

240
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,578
给我  给我
Come on. Give it to me. Give it to me.

241
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,083
不
No!

242
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:37,835
梅布尔
Maybelle!

243
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,885
化疗没起作用
The chemo isn't working.

244
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:52,688
她的骨髓又开始产生不良白细胞了
Her bone marrow is producing abnormal white blood cells again.

245
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,144
这可不是好消息
Which isn't very good news, of course.

246
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:58,402
但我们说过  我们不会放弃
But, as we've already discussed, we're not giving up yet.

247
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:02,652
我们进入下一阶段治疗即可
We will simply move on to the next stage in the treatment,

248
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,693
干细胞移植
a stem cell transplant.

249
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:09,614
我们先用更多的化疗和放疗
First, we will destroy her own bone marrow

250
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,999
摧毁她自身的白细胞
with more chemo and radiotherapy,

251
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:17,709
然后再移植捐赠者的新干细胞
then we will replace it with new stem cells from a donor.

252
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:20,590
捐赠者和梅布尔越亲近越好
A donor who is as close to Maybelle as possible.

253
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:23,798
但很遗憾  父母不能做捐赠者
Unfortunately, parents can't be considered as donors.

254
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,297
怎么样？
How did it go?

255
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:06,211
- 下午过的不好 - 怎么了？
It was a difficult afternoon. - How come?

256
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,005
你刚走
Just after you'd gone

257
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:14,725
她在外面画画  又有只鸟飞进排廊了
she was doing some drawing outside and another bird flew into our terranda.

258
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:21,485
我走出去看见她站在那哭  手里捧着只死鸟
I came out and she was standing there crying, with a dead bird in her hands.

259
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:27,862
- 有长廊不就好了 - 那更严重了  鸟很笨的
That wouldn't happen with a veranda. - It'd happen even more! Stupid birds!

260
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:34,206
你得相信它们骨子里就笨
You'd think that it would eventually be written in their genes.

261
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:39,621
这是本能  从爹妈那里继承的
That it'd become a sort of instinct passed on from mummy bird to chick,

262
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:45,293
一看见框架就知道飞过去有危险
that when they see a frame they realize it's dangerous to try to fly through it.

263
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:51,552
但鸟儿进化成能够穿越玻璃之前
But innumerable generations of birds obviously need to

264
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:55,015
还能在玻璃上撞好几代呢
fly into that window before it starts to get through to them.

265
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,223
- 再见 - 再见
Bye. - Bye.

266
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:08,149
你应该解释给孩子听
You should try explaining to a child

267
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:11,694
为什么鸟儿不能动了
how come the bird isn't moving anymore.

268
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:14,746
- 很难 - 我知道
It's difficult. - I know.

269
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:20,786
我很想说人们有各种各样的解释
You want to say people have come up with all kinds of ways of dealing with it.

270
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:24,081
有人说鸟儿有不死的灵魂
That some people believe the bird has a soul

271
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:27,342
会升入天堂
that doesn't die and goes up to heaven.

272
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:32,301
那里可以再见到爸爸妈妈  一起飞翔
That it'll see it's mummy and daddy again there and will fly around forever

273
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:36,310
那里阳光永远灿烂  不会有任何窗户
in a place where the sun always shines and there aren't any windows.

274
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:40,890
有人说鸟儿是殉道者
That other people believe the bird is a martyr

275
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:43,309
死于和窗户的搏斗
in the fight against windows.

276
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:48,151
死后他会得到很多未见过的雌鸟
And after his death he'll be given lots of female birds that have never mated

277
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,816
他可以尽情欢愉
and he can do what he wants with them.

278
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,779
但是这些爸爸都不相信
But Daddy doesn't believe in any of that.

279
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:58,244
爸爸觉得…
Daddy thinks that...

280
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:02,995
万物死了就是死了
that everything just dies and stays dead.

281
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:05,376
但是…
But...

282
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:11,716
- 你不能这样说 - 对  不能
But you can't say that. - No, you can't say that, Didier.

283
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:32,112
她自身免疫力会被完全摧毁
Her natural resistance will be destroyed completely first

284
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,616
她会变得非常脆弱
and she'll be very weak.

285
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:37,780
所以我们把她放入无菌舱
Which is why we're putting her in a sterile, pressurized room.

286
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:41,792
新的血细胞会攻击她的身体
The new blood cells may attack her body.

287
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:46,000
而同体干细胞则没事
That doesn't happen with identical stem cells

288
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:50,463
但必须找到同卵双胞胎或者克隆胚胎
but you only find those in the case of identical twins or cloned embryos.

289
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,344
很遗憾科学还未实现这些
Unfortunately, science hasn't got that far yet.

290
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:58,217
她的机会很大
Her chances are very good.

291
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:01,728
痊愈的机会很大
She has a very good chance of being completely cured.

292
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,725
别气馁
Don't lose heart.

293
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,812
谢谢
Thank you.

294
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,244
- 爸爸 - 嗯？
Daddy? - Yes?

295
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:23,082
鸟儿变成星星了
That birdie has become a star now.

296
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,259
亲爱的
OK, sweetie.

297
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:39,426
如果你愿意相信  那鸟儿变成星星了
If you want to believe that that birdie is a star now, then it is.

298
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:43,429
来  选一个吧
I'll tell you what, choose one.

299
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:49,901
那个
That one.

300
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:54,315
那个？又大又亮的？
That one? That big shiny one up there?

301
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,654
那个？好
That one? OK.

302
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:04,074
- 鸟儿再见 - 鸟儿再见
Bye-bye, birdie. - Bye-bye, birdie.

303
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:14,380
- 我爱你 - 我也爱你
I love you. - I love you too.

304
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,089
聪明的小女孩
Clever girl.

305
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:20,557
这是血液
And that, that's blood.

306
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:24,561
干细胞就在里面  就像小士兵
The stem cells are in there. Stem cells are little soldiers

307
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:29,316
会列队进入你的血液
who will march down that tube into your blood.

308
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:33,357
然后这些小兵开始干活
And those little soldiers mean business.

309
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:36,315
懂了？
Understand? Eh?

310
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,199
它们会治好你
They are going to cure you.

311
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,829
- 你好 - 你好
Hey. - Hello.

312
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,744
- 我们可以回家了 - 是么？
We're allowed to go home. - Are you?

313
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:49,753
- 米兰的指数正常了 - 太棒了
Milan's levels are perfect - Great!

314
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:52,251
祝贺你们
Congratulations.

315
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:28,370
那是飞机？那是鸟儿？
Is it a plane? Is it a bird?

316
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:31,912
- 不  那不是 - 梅布尔…
No, it's not. - Maybelle...

317
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:37,335
- 那是美佳·明迪(比利时女超人) - 再去睡会
It's Mega Mindy. - It's too early. Get some more sleep.

318
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,755
- 你太闹腾了 - 那是飞机？那是鸟儿？
You're far too lively for me. - Is it a plane? Is it a bird?

319
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:45,141
- 不  那不是 - 再睡会好吗？
No, it's not. - How about getting some more sleep?

320
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,474
不  我六岁了  我要叫你们起床
No, I'm 6, I was allowed to wake you up early.

321
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:53,608
是啊  今天是你的生日
Oh yes, of course, it's your birthday.

322
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:56,360
不要挠痒痒  不要
No, don't tickle me! Don't!

323
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,148
- 不要挠痒痒 - 生日快乐
Don't, don't tickle me! - Happy birthday!

326
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,490
穿着粉色风衣
In your pink costume.

327
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,042
- 再睡会好吗 - 不行
How about getting some more sleep? - No.

328
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,373
好吧
Yes. Come on.

329
00:40:13,446 --> 00:40:16,641
「那是美佳·明迪」

330
00:40:16,641 --> 00:40:19,488
「美佳·明迪」

331
00:40:19,907 --> 00:40:22,141
「那是飞机？那是鸟儿？」

332
00:40:22,141 --> 00:40:24,664
「不  都不是」

333
00:40:24,664 --> 00:40:27,836
「那是美佳·明迪」

334
00:40:27,836 --> 00:40:30,179
「在空中飞翔」

335
00:40:30,648 --> 00:40:33,226
「那是飞机？那是鸟儿？」

336
00:40:33,226 --> 00:40:35,609
「不  都不是」

337
00:40:35,609 --> 00:40:38,564
「那是美佳·明迪」

338
00:40:38,564 --> 00:40:41,595
「在空中飞翔」

339
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:52,918
你弄好了吗？
Right, have you almost finished?

340
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:54,794
亲爱的  快点
Come on, sweetie.

341
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:58,214
漱口
Rinse your mouth.

- 穿上另一只 - 妈妈  我好累
Now what? Get the other one. Come on. - I'm tired, Mummy.

345
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:20,403
我也是  亲爱的  我们都累

346
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,280
但我们得快点
But we have to get a move on, eh?

347
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,407
- 亲亲 - 公车来了  快点
Kiss. - The bus is there. Come on.

348
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:30,364
- 衣服 - 你牙龈出血了
Coat. - You're bleeding round your teeth.

349
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:34,956
我跟你说过多少次  刷牙不要太用力
How often have I told you not to scrub so hard with your toothbrush?

350
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:37,496
- 背包 - 对了
Rucksack. - Right.

351
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,835
- 让她上学去 - 好
Let her go now. - Alright.

352
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,771
- 迪迪埃？ - 嗯？
Didier? - Yes?

353
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,314
就一支
Just one.

354
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:09,661
- 我一会儿就开门通风 - 好
I'll open the door in a minute. - Yeah, yeah.

355
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:19,004
- 她胳膊上的淤青又多了 - 我看到了
She's got more bruises on her arms. - I know, I saw them.

356
00:42:24,532 --> 00:42:31,845
「我本是陌路行者」

357
00:42:32,678 --> 00:42:39,641
「穿行于伤悲之世」

358
00:42:41,334 --> 00:42:48,786
「那里并无疾病危难」

359
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:56,616
「我此行  前往光明世界」

360
00:42:58,341 --> 00:43:06,169
「我此行  为探望我父」

361
00:43:07,227 --> 00:43:14,985
「我此行  为不再远行」

362
00:43:15,933 --> 00:43:23,471
「我将要越过约旦之水」

363
00:43:24,628 --> 00:43:31,128
「我将要回到家乡之地」

364
00:43:32,933 --> 00:43:41,782
「我知黑暗绕我」

365
00:43:42,349 --> 00:43:49,229
「我知路途莽峻」

366
00:43:51,005 --> 00:43:59,500
「但美景就在前方」

367
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:07,137
「那里上帝赎你  祈祷继续」

368
00:44:08,582 --> 00:44:15,987
「我此行  为探望我母」

369
00:44:17,222 --> 00:44:25,109
「她在家  迎接我归来」

370
00:44:25,953 --> 00:44:33,606
「我将要越过约旦之水」

371
00:44:35,382 --> 00:44:42,007
「我将要回到家乡之地」

372
00:46:01,336 --> 00:46:06,945
「睡吧睡吧  小宝贝」

373
00:46:10,588 --> 00:46:15,757
「睡吧睡吧  小宝贝」

374
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:23,254
「妈妈走了  爸爸留下」

375
00:46:23,254 --> 00:46:30,475
「不丢下一个人  除了宝贝」

376
00:46:32,521 --> 00:46:44,521
「睡吧睡吧  小宝贝…」

377
00:46:44,521 --> 00:46:49,601
「大家都去棉花地和玉米地」

378
00:46:49,601 --> 00:46:56,364
「不丢下一个人  除了宝贝」

379
00:46:58,562 --> 00:47:10,186
「你是甜美的小宝贝…」

380
00:47:10,186 --> 00:47:14,944
「身躯留在雪白的石棺」

381
00:47:14,944 --> 00:47:22,035
「做我永远珍爱的宝贝」

382
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,371
给你
Here.

383
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:18,377
谢谢
Thanks.

384
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,224
需要生炉子吗？
Shall I light the stove?

385
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:40,103
不用
No. No, it's OK.

386
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:46,864
亲爱的  周日去看看我母亲好吗？
Sweetheart... Can we go and see my mum Sunday?

387
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:52,035
好吧
Yes... I think so.

388
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:05,212
周日是母亲节
It's... It's Mother's Day on Sunday.

389
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:15,851
她会很高兴见到你的
She'll be pleased to see you.

390
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:18,084
该死  该死  你必须撑住  亲爱的
Fuck! Fuck! You're going to pull through, sweetheart. Goddammit!

391
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:25,249
她心脏停跳了  停车
Her heart has stopped. Stop the ambulance.

392
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:29,595
出什么事了？
What the fuck is happening now?

393
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:42,350
- 肾上腺素 - 怎么了？
Adrenalin, OK? - What's happening?

394
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,231
- 出什么事了 - 她快不行了
What's happening? - We're losing her.

395
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:48,443
把她救过来  听见了吗  救过来
You're not losing her. D'you hear me? You're not!

396
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,945
她不能死  听见了吗
Don't let her go! D'you hear me?

397
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,827
- 她不能死 - 退后  冷静点
Don't let her go. - Move back and calm down, please.

398
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:59,166
我们要电击了  好吗
We're going to shock her. OK, shocking. Watch out.

399
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:01,039
所有人站稳
Everyone stand clear.

400
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,250
三  二  一
Three, two, one.

401
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:08,668
看看显示屏  谢谢
Let's check. The monitor, please. Thank you.

402
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:14,974
冷静点  冷静点
Take it easy, take it easy. Calm down.

403
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:21,310
冷静点  好吗
Calm down, OK? We'll just check.

404
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,938
- 她活过来了 - 好  我们走
She's back. - OK, let's go.

405
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:30,610
走
Go go go.

406
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:57,780
爱丽丝
Elise...

407
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:09,455
你要找点事做  亲爱的  不能像这样
You need to do something, sweetheart. Things can't go on like this.

408
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:13,092
我们需要点变化
Things... Things need to change.

409
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:23,060
你要做点以前爱做的事情
You'd like things to be like they used to be, eh?

410
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:25,562
是的  当然
Yes, of course.

411
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:33,237
在梅布尔出生前  你没想过要小孩对吧
Before we had Maybelle. You never wanted the child, did you?

412
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:39,031
爱丽丝  这不公平
Elise, that... That's not fair, sweetheart.

413
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:43,198
我本该听你的  你不想要小孩
I should've listened to you. You didn't want kids.

414
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:49,037
是的  你怀孕了  我确实很吃惊
I did. You being pregnant just took me by surprise, sweetheart.

415
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:52,082
我从未想过要小孩
I'd never given kids a thought.

416
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:55,797
但自打她一出生  我就是世上最快乐的男人
But once she was there I was the happiest man in the world.

417
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:59,554
高兴得都酗酒了
So happy that you started drinking.

418
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:04,890
- 你只是想吵架吧 - 她出生时你酗酒了
You just want to pick a fight. - You were drunk when she was born.

419
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:11,310
她一出生  你就和哥们去酒吧庆祝了
And once she was there you had to head for a bar with your pals to celebrate.

420
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:14,445
- 一走就是十天 - 你太夸张了
You were gone for ten days. - You're exaggerating.

421
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:17,573
喝出黄疸你才回家
You only came home when you developed jaundice from drinking.

422
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:21,577
- 那不是喝出来的 - 是喝出来的
That wasn't from drinking... - It was from drinking.

所以我不得不停止母乳

00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:31,330
由于你的黄疸  我只能喂她两周
I could only breastfeed her for two weeks because you had jaundice

425
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:35,341
母乳里的抗体对那小不点很重要
and it's full of antibodies that are important for a little mite like that.

426
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:40,096
你刚怀孕三个月的时候…
You can talk. For the first three months you were pregnant...

427
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:43,807
说啊  说啊  都对  都对
Go on, say it. Say it. It's true. It's true.

428
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:48,938
开始三个月时我抽烟喝酒

429
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:54,944
- 但我不知道自己怀孕了 - 这不是你的错
but I didn't know I was pregnant. - It's not your fault, sweetheart.

430
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:57,946
头三个月婴儿就形成了

431

六周大脑就完全形成

Stop it, Elise! Stop it! - I didn't know.

433
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:05,909
别说了
Stop!

434
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:12,545
人们会死的很离奇  也许地方太脏了
People die for the stupidest of reasons. Maybe this place was too dirty for her.

435
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:15,957
也许吃了不该吃的东西
Maybe she ate something she shouldn't have done

436
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:19,923
- 或者应该多换床单 - 你想说什么？
or we should've changed her sheets more. - What are you saying?

437
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,679
- 谁换的床单？- 我不是那意思
Who changed her sheets? - I didn't mean anything.

438
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:27,765
谁每天做饭  每天都是新鲜食物和有机食物
Who fed her? Cooked for her? Fresh food, organic food, every day.

439
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:30,600
是我  谁打扫的卫生？还是我
I did. And who cleaned the place? I did!

440
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:35,393
我说话没走脑子  我可能说错话了
I just said the first things that came into my head, I could've said anything.

441
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:37,186
你在责怪我  对吧
You're blaming me, aren't you?

442
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:39,400
- 我没有 - 你在责怪我
I'm not. - You're blaming me.

443
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:42,407
- 你在责怪我 - 我没有
You're blaming me. - I'm not!

444
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:47,746
- 我也有的说 - 什么
I can have a go at you too. - What?

445
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:51,875
我们家从来没有癌症
There isn't any cancer in my family,

446
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:55,379
你们家有  你两个叔叔和父亲
but there is in yours. Two uncles and your dad.

447
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:04,964
去你的  爱丽丝
Fuck you, Elise!

448
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:08,304
- 去你的 - 去你的

- 去你的 - 去你的

450
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:16,063
- 你从来就不相信 - 你说什么？
You were never for it. Never! - What did you say?

451
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:20,695
去你的  臭婊子

Come in, I'll do you one. - No, no.

454
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:53,554
- 进来 - 实话实说  我不喜欢这个
Come in. - It's not my kind of thing. Honestly.

455
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:58,066
怎么可以在身体上纹个永远去不掉的东西
What could possibly be worth putting on your body and never be removed?

456
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:02,063
- 你就不后悔吗 - 会后悔呀
Don't you regret any of your tattoos? - Of course I do.

Oh yes, that there's nothing in your life worth putting on your body.

469

我生命中有很多珍贵的东西

「就在那片光荣的土地」

556
01:11:12,884 --> 01:11:16,753
「我和强大的主站在一起」

557
01:11:16,753 --> 01:11:20,662
「就在那片光荣的土地」

558
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:41,159
「我走在前往殿堂的路上」

559
01:11:41,566 --> 01:11:45,128
「就在那片光荣的土地」

560
01:11:45,128 --> 01:11:49,186
「唱着赞美主的歌  分享他的光荣」

561
01:11:49,186 --> 01:11:53,099
「就在那片光荣的土地」

562
01:11:53,099 --> 01:11:57,437
「就在那片光荣的土地」

563
01:11:57,437 --> 01:12:01,436
「我加入快乐天使的乐队」

564
01:12:01,436 --> 01:12:05,423
「就在那片光荣的土地」

565
01:10:49,871 --> 01:10:52,795
伙计们  看看谁回来了
Hey, guys. - Look who it is. Hi.

566
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:08,374
- 你穿着那内裤真可爱 - 是吗
You look lovely in your underpants. - He does, eh?

567
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:11,878
- 啤酒给谁的？- 有一杯是我的
Who was the beer for? - There was one for me.

568
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:13,458
- 你有票吗？- 是的
Did you have a ticket? - Yes.

569
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:16,716
- 我也订了一杯 - 没门
Me too, I ordered one. - No way.

570
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:20,253
你只有三张票
You only had three tickets. - Last week I...

571
01:13:22,665 --> 01:13:24,776
「我们相信」

572
01:13:24,776 --> 01:13:26,620
「人人生来平等」

573
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:29,187
「造物主赐予我们」

574
01:13:29,187 --> 01:13:31,370
「生存的权利」

575
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:36,748
「我们要避免这笔资金带来的戏剧性场面」

576
01:13:36,748 --> 01:13:42,115
「有人却认为干细胞研究可以拯救生命」

577
01:13:42,115 --> 01:13:46,943
「百万美国人死于干细胞可以治愈的疾病」

578
01:13:46,943 --> 01:13:48,444
「我们不能再等了」

579
01:13:48,444 --> 01:13:53,680
「总统的决定使我们失去了宝贵时间和资源」

580
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:57,242
「布什总统的回应却仍然是努力说服大众」

581
01:13:57,242 --> 01:14:00,298
「如果我们能找到合适方法促进医学进步」

582
01:14:00,298 --> 01:14:04,172
「我们必须同时拒绝那些错误的方法」

583
01:14:04,172 --> 01:14:07,366
「所以我和国会否决这项资金」

584
01:14:07,366 --> 01:14:10,288
几个月来都在听到干细胞的消息
For months we were surrounded by stem cells

585
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:15,668
我们都觉得医学还不够发达
and we had the feeling that medical science wasn't going far enough.

586
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:18,170
就像有人在踩刹车
That the brakes had been applied.

587
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:21,959
这种感觉无法解释  然后孩子死了
It's a feeling you can't explain and your child dies...

588
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:25,048
现在又听到这个混蛋说
And then you hear that bastards like that

589
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:27,964
要把此项研究暂缓几年
have been slowing everything down for years.

590
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:31,384
为了宗教的原因
For religious reasons.

591
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:36,689
迪迪埃
Didier...

592
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:38,857
那是美国
That's America.

593
01:14:40,518 --> 01:14:45,490
是被允许的  正因如此医学才未有进步
It is allowed here, it's just that they haven't got that far yet.

594
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:49,528
因为这个混蛋几年内都在暂缓研究
Because those bastards have been slowing everything down for years.

595
01:14:50,111 --> 01:14:52,879
谁给你的权利呢？
But what gives them the right to do that? Eh?

596
01:14:52,879 --> 01:14:58,664
「这超越了我们这个社会所尊敬的道德界限」

597
01:14:58,664 --> 01:15:00,933
「所以我否决了它」

598
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:07,503
他们称自己反对堕胎
They call themselves pro-life.

599
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:10,093
杀人的技术丝毫不受限
Technology for killing people knows no bounds,

600
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:12,930
治病救人的却完全不同
but technology for curing people is a different story.

601
01:15:13,092 --> 01:15:16,813
就因为胚胎在体外生长
Because embryos are grown outside of marriage.

602
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:19,474
胚胎只有针尖那么大
Embryos the size of a pinhead.

603
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,688
这个虚伪的混蛋
The hypocritical bastard!

604
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:25,901
反堕胎？混蛋！
Pro-life? My arse, arsehole!

605
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:30,869
你们这群极端原教旨主义者
Bunch of extremist fundamentalists!

606
01:15:30,869 --> 01:15:31,143
把十字架贴到屁股上吧！
Stick your cross up your arse!

607
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:33,780
动动你们的大脑  混蛋
Next to your brain. Goddammit!

608
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:37,408
迪迪埃
Didier...

609
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:41,124
- 别这样 - 该死的  爱丽丝
Don't. - Bloody hell, Elise.

610
01:15:41,287 --> 01:15:43,836
整个世界都为宗教而疯狂
The whole world is obsessed with religion.

611
01:15:43,998 --> 01:15:46,968
整个世界为之疯狂  你也一样
The whole world has gone crazy! And so have you.

612
01:15:47,126 --> 01:15:50,596
你以为我不知道？我很笨？是吗？
D'you think I don't know? That I'm stupid? Do you?

613
01:15:50,755 --> 01:15:53,508
你以为我不知道贴纸拿来做什么？
D'you think I don't know why that sticker is there?

614
01:15:53,674 --> 01:15:56,223
因为你相信梅布尔会回来看你
Because you believe Maybelle may come back to see you

615
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:59,355
然后撞到玻璃上
and fly into that glass?

616
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:01,182
不是吗？
Is that it?

617
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:37,852
亲爱的
Sweetheart...

618
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:20,269
停下  停下
Stop a moment. Stop a moment.

619
01:17:20,427 --> 01:17:24,227
停下  就一会
Stop a moment. Stop. Just a moment.

620
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:26,475
我要问你点事情
I want to ask you something.

621
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:28,944
要是约翰尼可以的话  我也可以
If Johnny's allowed to do it, so am I.

622
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:33,486
- 爱丽丝  你愿意嫁给我吗 - 不行
Elise, will you marry me? - No.

623
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:36,656
拜托
Please.

624
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:40,073
- 帮帮我  女士们先生们 - 不行
Help me, ladies and gentlemen. Elise! - No!

625
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:55,592
给我一个别针
Pass me a pin.

626
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:02,178
- 固定住 - 我弄着呢
Just stick it in. - That's what I'm doing.

627
01:18:26,625 --> 01:18:27,916
迪迪埃·邦提克

628
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:34,081
你愿意接受爱丽丝·范·德费尔德为妻吗

629
01:18:35,328 --> 01:18:41,641
拥有并持有  从这天开始  是好  是坏

630
01:18:43,267 --> 01:18:46,146
是富  是穷

631
01:18:47,155 --> 01:18:48,088
是疾病…

632
01:18:51,747 --> 01:18:54,784
是疾病  是健康

633
01:18:56,001 --> 01:19:01,833
爱并珍惜着  直到死亡将我们分开

634
01:19:06,502 --> 01:19:08,355
我愿意

635
01:19:14,382 --> 01:19:16,017
爱丽丝·范·德费尔德

636
01:19:18,038 --> 01:19:19,740
你愿意接受迪迪埃·邦提克…

637
01:19:23,705 --> 01:19:26,450
为你的丈夫吗？

638
01:19:27,943 --> 01:19:31,295
拥有并持有…

639
01:19:31,295 --> 01:19:32,809
我愿意

640
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:35,438
是吗？
Do you?

641
01:19:37,581 --> 01:19:42,387
拥有并持有  是好  是坏

642
01:19:43,117 --> 01:19:45,042
是疾病  是健康

643
01:19:45,726 --> 01:19:49,357
直到死亡将我们分开

644
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:20,692
稍等会
I'll just be a moment.

645
01:20:31,452 --> 01:20:33,671
- 你好 - 你好
Hi. - Hi.

646
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:43,301
- 最近怎么样 - 还行
How's things? - OK.

647
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:45,758
你睡在这里？
Are you sleeping here now?

648
01:20:47,718 --> 01:20:51,564
现在是的  我在楼上有床垫
Yes, for now. I've got a mattress upstairs.

649
01:20:56,435 --> 01:20:58,984
这只是暂时的好吗  亲爱的？
It's only temporary, eh, sweetheart?

650
01:21:02,941 --> 01:21:05,069
爱丽丝  我…
Elise, I...

651
01:21:07,446 --> 01:21:10,290
我要是没有你该怎么办  爱丽丝
What would I do without you, Elise?

652
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:12,372
我不是爱丽丝了
It's not Elise anymore.

653
01:21:13,827 --> 01:21:15,955
我改名了
I've changed my name.

654
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:18,549
我现在叫阿拉巴马
I'm called Alabama now.

655
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:20,960
什么？
What?

656
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:22,969
阿拉巴马
Alabama.

657
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:26,556
阿拉巴马？
Alabama?

658
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:33,894
对  想改就改  像印度人那样
Yes. I've changed my name, like the Indians do when they feel like it.

659
01:21:34,056 --> 01:21:37,651
人生进入下一阶段就改名
When they feel they've taken another step in their life.

660
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:40,529
爱丽丝  别做蠢事
Come on, Elise, don't be so silly.

661
01:21:40,771 --> 01:21:43,820
叫我阿拉巴马  好吗？
Just call me Alabama. OK?

662
01:21:55,828 --> 01:21:57,830
周六见？
Will I see you Saturday?

663
01:21:58,705 --> 01:22:01,424
我们还一起演出吗？还是不做了？
Are we still performing together? Or is that over too?

664
01:22:02,251 --> 01:22:04,925
你会去吗？
Well? Will you be there?

665
01:22:05,462 --> 01:22:07,009
会的
Yes.

666
01:22:35,993 --> 01:22:39,088
她为什么总给我打电话
Why does she always call me?

667
01:22:39,246 --> 01:22:40,919
你对她太好了
You were too nice to her.

668
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:47,971
- 你好  爱丽丝 - 你好
Hello, Elise. - Hello.

669
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:49,302
- 一切顺利？- 是的
Everything OK? - Sure.

670
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:54,346
他还可以叫你爱丽丝  还是告诉他们？
So he's still allowed to say Elise? Or haven't you told them yet?

671
01:22:55,721 --> 01:22:59,476
- 说吧 - 她不叫爱丽丝了
No. - No? She's not called Elise anymore.

672
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:05,273
她正式地改了名字  她现在叫阿拉巴马
She's officially changed her name. She's now called Alabama.

673
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:07,533
- 真的？- 是吗？
Really? - Is that true?

674
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:09,614
- 护照上也改了？- 是的
On your passport and everything? - Yes.

675
01:23:11,195 --> 01:23:15,450
所以我们现在叫你阿拉巴马？真的？
So we have to call you Alabama now? Seriously?

676
01:23:15,782 --> 01:23:18,205
- 你好  阿拉巴马 - 阿拉巴马
Hello, Alabama. - Alabama.

677
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:25,551
阿拉巴马  我能问你点事吗？
Hey, Alabama... May I ask you something?

678
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:34,267
我是谁？
Who am I?

679
01:23:35,969 --> 01:23:38,813
你要是阿拉巴马  那我是谁？
If you're Alabama, who am I?

680
01:23:46,522 --> 01:23:47,819
门罗
Monroe.

681
01:23:50,484 --> 01:23:54,455
- 比尔·门罗 - 不是  玛丽琳·门罗
Oh, Bill Monroe. - No, Marilyn Monroe.

682
01:23:54,613 --> 01:23:56,615
我也想要个酷的蓝草名
I want a cool bluegrass name too.

683
01:23:56,782 --> 01:23:59,205
- 给他起个名 - 琳达如何
Go on, give him a name... I know, Linda.

684
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:02,212
- 琳达  很简单 - 得了 伙计们
Simple. You're Linda. - Come on, guys.

685
01:24:29,775 --> 01:24:35,440
「如果我需要你  你能否来看我」

686
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:41,949
「能否来看我  抚平我的伤痛」

687
01:24:43,209 --> 01:24:48,995
「如果你需要我  我可以去看你」

688
01:24:48,995 --> 01:24:55,841
「我游过大海  抚平你的伤痛」

689

「夜晚孤寂  清晨新生」

690
01:25:03,369 --> 01:25:09,207
「孕育着爱的光线」

691
01:25:10,370 --> 01:25:17,043
「如果闭上眼睛  你会错过日出」

692
01:25:17,043 --> 01:25:23,365
「这讲扯碎我的心房」

693
01:25:23,995 --> 01:25:30,227
「如果我需要你  你能否来看我」

694
01:25:30,227 --> 01:25:37,145
「能否来看我  抚平我的伤痛」

695
01:25:37,145 --> 01:25:43,901
「如果你需要我  我可以去看你」

696
01:25:43,901 --> 01:25:51,026
「我游过大海  抚平你的伤痛」

698
01:26:25,689 --> 01:26:31,161
「如何把玉手放入我掌心」

699
01:26:32,587 --> 01:26:39,021
「谁都会同意  她是美丽风景」

700
01:26:39,021 --> 01:26:44,568
「就像穷人寻找的财富」

701
01:26:46,523 --> 01:26:52,213
「如果我需要你  你能否来看我」

702
01:26:52,213 --> 01:26:59,053
「能否来看我  抚平我的伤痛」

703
01:26:59,053 --> 01:27:05,904
「如果你需要我  我可以去看你」

704
01:27:05,904 --> 01:27:12,847
「我游过大海  抚平你的伤痛」

705
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:36,927
你知道…
Do you know...

706
01:27:38,879 --> 01:27:41,428
你知道我为谁感到遗憾吗？
Do you know who I feel sorry for?

707
01:27:41,673 --> 01:27:46,770
从达尔文开始研究生物学的科学家们
The scientists who, since Darwin, have spent their time studying biology.

708
01:27:47,345 --> 01:27:53,273
他们尝试解释、描述和研究这个世界
Who have tried to explain this wonderful world, to describe it and study it.

709
01:27:53,435 --> 01:27:58,441
他们在最艰难的条件下耗尽自己的生命
Who've spent their whole life doing it in the most difficult conditions.

710
01:27:58,607 --> 01:28:03,238
我还为那些蠢人们感到遗憾
And who now hear that there are still spastics

711
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:05,952
他们还在质疑进化论
who question the theory of evolution.

712
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:07,457
这完全是因为耶和华
Because it was Yahweh.

713
01:28:07,616 --> 01:28:11,416
耶和华在六天内创造了一切
Yahweh created everything and he did it in six days.

714
01:28:11,578 --> 01:28:13,956
而不是45亿年
And not in 4.5 billion years.

715
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:17,626
这让你想吐  一帮蠢货
It's enough to make you puke. Bunch of imbeciles!

716
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:23,466
让我来告诉你们一些事吧  耶和华
But let me tell you something. Yahweh,

717
01:28:23,632 --> 01:28:25,902
旧约里的上帝
the God from the Old Testament

718
01:28:25,902 --> 01:28:28,604
百分之八十的人类曾经膜拜的神
the God that 80% of the world kneels before,

719
01:28:28,762 --> 01:28:32,892
是文献记载中最邪恶的人
is by far the most evil person in literature.

720
01:28:33,058 --> 01:28:36,779
看看圣经吧  好好看看
Check out your Bible. Read it carefully.

721
01:28:36,937 --> 01:28:40,943
他是操纵者  虐待狂
Yahweh is a manipulator, a sadist

722
01:28:40,943 --> 01:28:43,372
杀人犯  种族主义者
a killer, a racist

723
01:28:43,372 --> 01:28:46,659
讨厌女人和同性恋  心胸狭隘和爱慕虚荣
a misogynist, a homophobe, who is narrow-minded and vain,

724
01:28:46,822 --> 01:28:48,870
进行种族清洗
who carries out ethnic cleansing,

725
01:28:49,032 --> 01:28:54,038
要求儿童祭品  玩虐待游戏考验人们的忠诚
who demands child sacrifices and plays sadistic games to test people's faith.

726
01:28:54,204 --> 01:28:58,550
一个独裁者  故意创造天堂、地球和人类
A dictator who apparently created heaven and earth and mankind on purpose

727
01:28:58,708 --> 01:29:02,212
所以我们不得不卑微的祈求他
so we'd fall humbly to our knees before Him

728
01:29:02,379 --> 01:29:06,009
恭恭敬敬的给他唱赞歌
and deferentially sing His praise.

729
01:29:06,174 --> 01:29:08,643
我生来并非如此
Well, I wasn't created in that image.

730
01:29:08,802 --> 01:29:13,649
我不是神的旨意  我比那要好
I'm not taking orders from a God like that. I'm better than that.

731
01:29:16,226 --> 01:29:17,728
我是…
I'm...

732
01:29:19,646 --> 01:29:21,319
我是只猴子
I'm a monkey.

733
01:29:21,857 --> 01:29:23,359
我很害怕
And I'm scared.

734
01:29:23,525 --> 01:29:27,905
我对大家很好  有时也会挨打
I know I have to be nice to my fellow man or I'll get a punch in the kisser.

735
01:29:28,071 --> 01:29:30,073
但我不需要上帝
I don't need a God for that.

736
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:33,665
我们创造上帝只因为我们害怕
We created gods because we were scared.

737
01:29:33,869 --> 01:29:36,088
别再害怕  别再无知
Out of fear, out of ignorance.

738
01:29:36,246 --> 01:29:41,798
如果今天有人说闪电是神的愤怒
If someone were to say today that lightning is God expressing his anger,

739
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:46,841
你们会怎样  我会放声大笑
what would you say? You'd laugh in their face.

740
01:29:47,007 --> 01:29:51,558
上帝不存在  上帝不存在
One more God to go. One more God to go.

741
01:29:51,761 --> 01:29:53,684
上帝不存在
One more God to go.

742
01:30:16,077 --> 01:30:21,004
我女儿梅布尔死了
My daughter, Maybelle... My little daughter died

743
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:25,967
因为宗教团体由于伦理问题禁止某些试验
because certain experiments are regarded as unethical by the religious
community.

744
01:30:26,129 --> 01:30:28,223
这只是个例
But that's a mere detail.

745
01:30:28,381 --> 01:30:30,475
每年无数的人死去
Millions of people die every year

746
01:30:30,634 --> 01:30:34,764
因为那个被称作神父的人渣说不能带套
cos the scumbag they call the Pope says you can't use a condom when having sex.

747
01:30:34,930 --> 01:30:37,934
从历史上看  这是个例
It's only a mere detail, historically speaking,

748
01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:41,353
但对我不是  对我不是啊
but not to me. Not to me.

749
01:30:57,744 --> 01:31:00,418
- 爱丽丝 - 阿拉巴马
Elise. - Alabama.

750
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:03,292
- 阿拉巴马 - 嗯？
Alabama. - Yes?

751
01:31:04,084 --> 01:31:09,386
如果我愿意相信梅布尔是天上的一颗星星
If I want to believe that Maybelle is a star up in the sky,

752
01:31:09,547 --> 01:31:11,174
我会相信的
I will.

753
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:16,430
如果我愿意相信她是一只鸟  在窗台上栖息
If I want to believe she's a bird that perches on our window sill,

754
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:18,690
或者是只蝴蝶  停在我肩膀
or a butterfly that sits on my shoulder

755
01:31:18,848 --> 01:31:23,319
-或者流血的青蛙 - 亲爱的  梅布尔死了
or a bloody frog that... - Maybelle is dead, sweetheart.

756
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:26,652
她死了  没有了  不在了
She's dead, she's gone! She's not here anymore.

757
01:31:26,815 --> 01:31:28,943
但我们还在这里  我还在这里
But we are still here. I'm still here.

758
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:32,093
- 我们还得过下去 - 迪迪埃  我已经死心了
We have to carry on together. - I've covered up your name, Didier.

759
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:44,800
你是个懦夫  彻底的懦夫
You're a coward. You're nothing but a coward.

760
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:46,926
懦夫
A coward!

761
01:31:48,962 --> 01:31:52,637
梅布尔不会想到会是这样  你为什么这样？
Maybelle wouldn't have wanted that. Why did you do it? Why?

762
01:32:01,057 --> 01:32:02,809
我知道
I knew.

763
01:32:03,226 --> 01:32:06,355
事实上  我一直知道
In fact, I've always known.

764
01:32:07,022 --> 01:32:08,820
这些想象对我来说很好
That it was too wonderful to be true.

765
01:32:08,982 --> 01:32:14,239
但它不能持久  生活不是那样  也并不慷慨
That it couldn't last. That life isn't like that, life isn't generous.

766
01:32:16,031 --> 01:32:20,502
你不能爱任何人  也不能被任何人爱
You mustn't love someone, you mustn't become attached to someone,

767
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:22,037
生活嫉妒你这些
life begrudges you that.

768
01:32:22,203 --> 01:32:28,006
它夺走你的一切  嘲笑你  背叛你
It takes everything away from you and laughs in your face. It betrays you.

769
01:32:28,168 --> 01:32:32,924
- 亲爱的  别这样 - 别那样叫我  迪迪埃
Sweetheart, don't... - Don't call me that, Didier.

770
01:32:33,089 --> 01:32:35,808
我不再是你的亲爱的
I'm not your sweetheart anymore!

771
01:32:35,967 --> 01:32:37,469
都结束了
It's over!

772
01:33:11,169 --> 01:33:12,671
你还好吗  伙计？
Are you alright, pal?

773
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:15,382
不好…不过…
No... but...

774
01:33:16,174 --> 01:33:17,266
谢谢
Thanks.

775
01:33:19,469 --> 01:33:23,064
- 我们打算做什么 - 演奏
What are we going to do? - Play.

776
01:33:25,058 --> 01:33:26,480
爱丽丝在哪
Where's Elise?

777
01:34:18,570 --> 01:34:23,497
爸爸  能再说一遍星星吗
Daddy, can you tell me about the stars again?

778
01:34:24,033 --> 01:34:25,376
说些什么？
What about them?

779
01:34:26,786 --> 01:34:30,131
说说它们如何消失
About how they've gone out.

780
01:34:35,753 --> 01:34:37,221
消失？
Gone out?

781
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:40,133
你以前说过的
You told me before.

782
01:34:42,093 --> 01:34:48,396
对  像这样的小星星
Right. A little star like this one is, in fact a...?

783
01:34:48,558 --> 01:34:51,812
- 太阳 - 太阳  对  梅布尔
A sun. - A sun. Yes, well done, Maybelle.

784
01:34:56,357 --> 01:34:59,406
太阳离我们非常非常遥远
It's a sun that is a very, very long way away.

785
01:34:59,569 --> 01:35:05,372
它的光线很长时间跨越很远很远
And its light has to travel a long way for a long time

786
01:35:05,533 --> 01:35:08,286
才能被我们看到
to reach your eyes.

787
01:35:08,453 --> 01:35:16,508
所以有时  星星已经消失了
So sometimes it's possible that the little star has already gone out

788
01:35:16,669 --> 01:35:21,266
但它们还能被我们看到
before the light reaches your eyes.

789
01:35:21,799 --> 01:35:28,102
所以你只是看到了不复存在的东西
So you see something that is no longer there.

790
01:35:29,057 --> 01:35:33,528
但没有关系  因为星星的光线
But that doesn't matter, because the light from a little star like that

791
01:35:33,686 --> 01:35:37,156
在空间中旅行  被你看到
carries on travelling, past your eyes.

792
01:35:37,315 --> 01:35:39,443
甚至更远  更远
Further and further.

793
01:35:39,609 --> 01:35:42,738
所以星星会一直存在
So that little star will exist forever.

794
01:35:42,904 --> 01:35:45,999
永远  永远
Forever and ever and ever.

795
01:38:05,296 --> 01:38:06,923
爱丽丝
Elise!

796
01:38:22,647 --> 01:38:23,899
天啊
Goddammit!

797
01:38:30,196 --> 01:38:31,413
女士
Madam.

798
01:38:31,572 --> 01:38:34,075
女士  你能听见吗？
Madam. Can you hear me?

799
01:38:41,749 --> 01:38:43,672
插管  插管
OK, intu bate, intu bate.

800
01:39:17,618 --> 01:39:18,744
爱丽丝
Elise!

801
01:39:37,305 --> 01:39:39,603
醒过来  求你了
Move back, please. OK.

802
01:39:46,022 --> 01:39:48,571
肾上腺素  肾上腺素
OK. Adrenalin. Adrenalin, please.

803
01:39:49,233 --> 01:39:51,952
救活她
No way. Don't let her go.

804
01:39:52,111 --> 01:39:55,365
我不会抛弃你的  亲爱的
I'm not letting you go, sweetheart.

805
01:40:03,372 --> 01:40:04,794
救活她
Don't let her go.

806
01:40:04,957 --> 01:40:09,087
人不再团圆了  你见不到梅布尔了
The circle is broken. You won't see Maybelle again.

807
01:40:09,337 --> 01:40:10,839
退后
Stand back, please.

808
01:40:11,756 --> 01:40:14,350
三  二  一
Three, two, one.

809
01:40:19,514 --> 01:40:20,561
爱丽丝
Elise!

810
01:41:56,819 --> 01:41:58,992
我们尽力了
We've done all the tests.

811
01:42:01,365 --> 01:42:03,959
她大脑损伤太严重
She's got serious brain damage.

812
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:11,298
我们会维持她的生命  但她已经脑死亡了
We are keeping her alive for now. But she is clinically dead.

813
01:42:14,253 --> 01:42:18,383
医疗建议是让她安静的离开
The medical team's advice is to let her go.

814
01:42:20,676 --> 01:42:22,053
对不起
I'm sorry.

815
01:42:25,890 --> 01:42:29,019
我能见见她吗  我想见见她
Can I see her? I want to see her.

816
01:45:23,526 --> 01:45:25,028
再见  亲爱的
Goodbye, sweetheart.

817
01:45:32,284 --> 01:45:33,331
你可以…
Will you...

818
01:45:35,871 --> 01:45:39,717
如果看见梅布尔  能代我问声好吗？
Will you say hello to Maybelle for me if you see her?

819
01:47:23,592 --> 01:47:28,264
