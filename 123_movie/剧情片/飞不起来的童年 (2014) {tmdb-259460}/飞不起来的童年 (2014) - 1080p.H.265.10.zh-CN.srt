1
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:21,545
Easy, SultÃ¡n...

2
00:01:26,955 --> 00:01:29,195
What's up boy?

3
00:01:35,155 --> 00:01:36,595
Carmela!

4
00:01:51,805 --> 00:01:53,431
Excuse me.

5
00:02:14,255 --> 00:02:16,905
I left coffee in the kitchen.

6
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,697
Let's go, teach.

7
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,625
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

8
00:02:29,715 --> 00:02:32,747
- Come on, hurry up or we'll be late.
- Give me that, teach.

9
00:02:33,065 --> 00:02:34,727
Since your grandson is going away

10
00:02:34,778 --> 00:02:37,183
I'll be helping you
with your things every day.

11
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:44,285
It's roughly written.

12
00:02:45,745 --> 00:02:48,781
Maybe I should have thought
some things better,

13
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,601
but this is how I feel.

14
00:02:56,545 --> 00:02:58,196
There's no "i" in friend.

15
00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:01,845
- Daniela, what word did you write?
- Friends.

16
00:03:02,425 --> 00:03:05,845
"Friends", very well.

17
00:03:06,635 --> 00:03:10,805
What other nouns
can you find in the story?

18
00:03:11,855 --> 00:03:15,475
My grandmother
was the grandchild of slaves,

19
00:03:15,775 --> 00:03:20,195
and she couldn't believe it when
I showed her my teacher degree.

20
00:03:20,695 --> 00:03:26,115
She spent five pesos to hung it next
to the image of the Virgin of Charity.

21
00:03:27,225 --> 00:03:29,065
It's still there.

22
00:03:29,528 --> 00:03:31,625
"Pigeon", very well.

23
00:03:32,075 --> 00:03:34,245
Very well, Pedrito...
Another word?

24
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,525
- Yesica.
- You're a clown, "papi".

25
00:03:36,575 --> 00:03:39,444
It's been fifty years now...

26
00:03:39,755 --> 00:03:44,045
and I've spent most
of that time in this classroom.

27
00:03:46,595 --> 00:03:49,008
I think most of you weren't born

28
00:03:49,059 --> 00:03:52,325
the first time I wrote
in this blackboard.

29
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:56,586
"Infancy". Very well, Yesica.

30
00:03:58,525 --> 00:04:00,705
Hey! Wait a minute!

31
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:02,855
- Where's the fire?
- Prof! Not now...

32
00:04:02,905 --> 00:04:05,505
You know I haven't
set your homework yet.

33
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:08,639
You're going to write an essay

34
00:04:08,932 --> 00:04:12,734
on any subject you want,
in the first person.

35
00:04:13,205 --> 00:04:16,875
Is that when you say
"I myself", teach?

36
00:04:17,835 --> 00:04:20,916
The first person would be like...

37
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:27,135
I am Chala...

38
00:04:28,265 --> 00:04:32,345
and I am hell on wheels...

39
00:04:33,905 --> 00:04:39,775
and because I'm a clown,
I'm always running from Carmela!

40
00:04:45,735 --> 00:04:50,275
- Watch out, Richard. Is it clear?
- It's clear, c'mon, hurry up!

41
00:04:51,655 --> 00:04:56,165
- Now we got it: "Sex A".
- That's why you get in so much trouble.

42
00:04:59,018 --> 00:05:01,075
That was cool, man!

43
00:05:05,545 --> 00:05:08,518
- Did you see what those crazies did?
- They are just fools.

44
00:05:09,735 --> 00:05:11,005
Yeni!

45
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,292
They're so childish!

46
00:05:17,555 --> 00:05:20,815
- Icy!
- Shut up. At least I try!

47
00:05:32,225 --> 00:05:34,898
Didn't I say I didn't want
any more trouble at school?

48
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,755
- Eat something before you go.
- Answer me, damn it!

49
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,125
It's not my fault.

50
00:05:40,495 --> 00:05:42,695
It's that social worker...

51
00:05:43,465 --> 00:05:46,465
They threatened me again
with re-education school.

52
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:49,245
It's always the same with them.

53
00:05:49,885 --> 00:05:53,385
This is for the electricity bill.
Minors are not allowed to pay it.

54
00:05:55,095 --> 00:05:59,095
- Where did you get that?
- My dog SultÃ¡n, he can't lose!

55
00:06:06,695 --> 00:06:09,095
Aren't you gonna eat?

56
00:06:10,865 --> 00:06:13,065
You made me lose my appetite.

57
00:06:14,495 --> 00:06:17,312
Remember, the money
is for the electricity bill.

58
00:06:31,345 --> 00:06:33,580
Ignacio, we're ready, man!

59
00:06:38,975 --> 00:06:40,698
Come here!

60
00:06:41,677 --> 00:06:43,865
- What's up, man?
- What are you doing here?

61
00:06:44,263 --> 00:06:46,200
- Is it over?
- Don't piss around.

62
00:06:46,263 --> 00:06:49,175
You know, you can't be up here
when there's fight.

63
00:06:49,355 --> 00:06:51,285
Bring the dog!

64
00:06:54,235 --> 00:06:57,235
I told you.
No dog can beat him!

65
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:01,125
Put this on "24".

66
00:07:01,745 --> 00:07:04,155
You don't say!
How funny!

67
00:07:04,205 --> 00:07:08,215
- C'mon, I always play that number!
- Kids don't gamble!

68
00:07:09,335 --> 00:07:13,595
Here, take him down
for a walk, he finished fresh.

69
00:07:15,965 --> 00:07:17,524
Hey!

70
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,267
Don't play with fire,
get down!

71
00:07:23,015 --> 00:07:26,352
I don't want you around
till this is finished.

72
00:08:42,525 --> 00:08:43,954
Hey, Chala!

73
00:08:44,185 --> 00:08:46,925
- What's up? - There's a man
looking for white pigeons.

74
00:08:46,975 --> 00:08:49,385
- Tell him I have.
- How much?

75
00:08:49,443 --> 00:08:51,467
A hundred a pigeon.

76
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,975
- My cut?
- Twenty pesos each.

77
00:08:55,057 --> 00:08:57,275
You got it.
You're a real bro!

78
00:08:57,349 --> 00:09:00,285
Hey! Chala, Chala!
The social worker is here!

79
00:09:00,785 --> 00:09:05,075
And the local police too!
We're doomed, man.

80
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:10,543
Until when, Sonia?
You have been warned a thousand times!

81
00:09:10,685 --> 00:09:12,695
That kid lives like an animal!

82
00:09:12,745 --> 00:09:15,035
You're the fucking animal!
Don't fuck with me!

83
00:09:15,085 --> 00:09:17,133
Norma, you take care of this...

84
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:22,544
- Don't fuck around here anymore!
- Ma'am, please, listen to me.

85
00:09:27,996 --> 00:09:29,195
What about this bite?

86
00:09:29,346 --> 00:09:32,405
They start playing and end up fighting.

87
00:09:32,895 --> 00:09:35,208
No... This was a real fight.

88
00:09:36,195 --> 00:09:39,036
- Who's to say?
- You have a big mouth, kid.

89
00:09:40,735 --> 00:09:43,745
Tell the social worker
to get off our backs.

90
00:09:44,205 --> 00:09:47,695
Chala...
You better speak to your mother,

91
00:09:47,745 --> 00:09:51,335
because you'll be the one
paying for the consequences.

92
00:09:57,575 --> 00:10:01,795
Listen ma'am, this is not
the first report from the social worker.

93
00:10:01,845 --> 00:10:06,225
And you know all of this
goes in Chala's Student Record.

94
00:10:10,315 --> 00:10:12,645
With all due respect director,

95
00:10:13,785 --> 00:10:16,355
while you're scribbling papers,

96
00:10:16,745 --> 00:10:19,634
I have to toil it real hard
to bring him up...

97
00:10:20,775 --> 00:10:24,245
What do you mean by
"toil it real hard"?

98
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:29,245
Do you really want
me to explain it?

99
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:33,166
Sonia, Raquel is the specialist
from the Municipality

100
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:35,475
who is in charge
of these type of cases.

101
00:10:35,525 --> 00:10:38,169
Chala, please, wait outside.

102
00:10:45,225 --> 00:10:48,185
Did you read this
before you sign it?

103
00:10:48,845 --> 00:10:50,456
What for? It's always the same.

104
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:53,847
They're suggesting
to take Chala away for a while.

105
00:10:53,897 --> 00:10:57,766
And give you all of the support you need
to solve your problem.

106
00:10:58,275 --> 00:10:59,775
My problem?

107
00:11:00,295 --> 00:11:04,035
Ma'am, you're perfectly aware
of what we're talking about...

108
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:09,325
...and as long as you don't own that,
Chala will be paying the consequences.

109
00:11:10,955 --> 00:11:13,085
Do we know each other?

110
00:11:14,085 --> 00:11:15,995
We don't. Don't we?

111
00:11:16,045 --> 00:11:18,521
Then I'm not going to answer you
like you deserve

112
00:11:18,572 --> 00:11:21,426
out of respect for the director
and Carmela.

113
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:27,725
What is this about taking
Chala away from home?

114
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:31,325
He needs to go into re-education,
Mercedes.

115
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:36,025
No student of mine has ever
ended up in a re-education school,

116
00:11:37,315 --> 00:11:39,815
and Chala is not going
to be the first.

117
00:11:40,025 --> 00:11:42,668
That's not for you to decide, Carmela.

118
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:47,335
The day I can't decide
what goes on in my class

119
00:11:47,385 --> 00:11:50,365
will be my last day as a teacher.

120
00:11:54,225 --> 00:11:57,295
- It's so nice, grandma...
- It is, isn't?

121
00:11:58,383 --> 00:12:00,314
Pull over, please.

122
00:12:01,045 --> 00:12:04,755
Mom, we need to be in the airport
two hours before the flight.

123
00:12:10,325 --> 00:12:11,564
Mom...

124
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,848
Don't worry, I'm not going
to take much of your time.

125
00:12:21,945 --> 00:12:25,990
What a perfume, uh?
This is fine to say goodbye.

126
00:12:27,925 --> 00:12:30,075
Aren't you going to the airport?

127
00:12:30,175 --> 00:12:33,925
- It's nicer in a place like this.
- Don't leave me hanging, grandma.

128
00:12:33,975 --> 00:12:37,475
As soon as the year is through
you must come to Miami with us.

129
00:12:41,675 --> 00:12:43,703
And when Camilo
gets out of the hospital...

130
00:12:43,754 --> 00:12:45,505
I'll give him your toys.

131
00:12:55,055 --> 00:12:57,685
How are you going back, mom?

132
00:12:58,675 --> 00:13:03,920
Don't worry.
I'll... take the bus or a taxi.

133
00:14:03,925 --> 00:14:09,417
In this exercise
we have to fill the empty spaces...

134
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:12,103
Silence!

135
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:17,505
- Chala, shut up!
- Keep your voice down, people.

136
00:14:17,555 --> 00:14:20,141
- What's going on, Yeni?
- Nothing, director.

137
00:14:21,935 --> 00:14:25,225
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

138
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,021
Well, as you already know,
Professor Carmela

139
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:31,832
will be recovering from a heart attack.
So, this is Marta...

140
00:14:32,445 --> 00:14:34,374
- She's hot!
- ... your new teacher.

141
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,324
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

142
00:14:40,335 --> 00:14:43,997
Chala, we appreciate
the enthusiastic welcome.

143
00:14:48,005 --> 00:14:50,715
- C'mon!
- Cut his thread!

144
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,515
He killed you, man

145
00:15:01,565 --> 00:15:03,435
- Pay.
- Put those teeth away.

146
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,815
I told you to put
those teeth away.

147
00:15:13,303 --> 00:15:14,542
Here!

148
00:15:15,725 --> 00:15:18,227
- C'mon, Richard.
- What are we betting now?

149
00:15:19,135 --> 00:15:21,306
Whatever you want, at school.

150
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:24,935
Did you chicken out?

151
00:15:25,665 --> 00:15:29,125
Easy, man.
I'll catch up with you at school.

152
00:15:30,925 --> 00:15:33,545
So you lose and I pay?
What's wrong with you, man?

153
00:15:33,595 --> 00:15:35,040
Why didn't you go for revenge?

154
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,215
Didn't you see how sharp
his bottle top was?

155
00:15:37,265 --> 00:15:39,975
Sharp? It's always something
different with you, man!

156
00:15:48,145 --> 00:15:50,275
What are you doing here?

157
00:15:51,155 --> 00:15:54,275
- Aren't you going out on the recess?
- Wait for me in the patio.

158
00:15:54,325 --> 00:15:56,075
I never show up in your classroom
like that.

159
00:15:56,235 --> 00:15:59,715
- Hey, NiÃ±o! Check out this cool thing!
- Give it back.

160
00:15:59,765 --> 00:16:02,765
- The "Palestinian" is hip!
- Hey, give it back!

161
00:16:03,335 --> 00:16:05,175
Calm down, man.

162
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:07,015
Chala, I know how
to defend myself.

163
00:16:07,065 --> 00:16:09,835
- I told you to give it back.
- I said calm down, man.

164
00:16:10,835 --> 00:16:12,875
I'm not afraid of you...

165
00:16:13,108 --> 00:16:15,505
Hey!
What's going on here?

166
00:16:16,925 --> 00:16:19,315
Come on, back to your classrooms.

167
00:16:19,365 --> 00:16:20,515
Give me that.

168
00:16:21,185 --> 00:16:23,685
You can tell your mom
to come and get it.

169
00:16:23,765 --> 00:16:25,765
That's mine, teacher.

170
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:28,815
Yoan, what's in your hand?

171
00:16:29,235 --> 00:16:32,105
- Nothing.
- Nothing? Let me see.

172
00:16:33,695 --> 00:16:35,985
What about that deck?

173
00:16:39,195 --> 00:16:42,195
Is it yours too, MarÃ­a Paula?

174
00:16:47,335 --> 00:16:49,841
Don't bring it again.

175
00:16:55,225 --> 00:16:57,165
I'm not bringing the deck anymore.

176
00:16:57,215 --> 00:16:59,045
Give it to me, Chala.

177
00:16:59,095 --> 00:17:02,185
What for?
So that my mom can come and get it?

178
00:17:05,355 --> 00:17:08,935
I'm not going to ask again.

179
00:17:17,225 --> 00:17:19,825
Come with me.

180
00:17:21,725 --> 00:17:23,900
Chala, come on!

181
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,455
Every year,
I have a Chala in my class...

182
00:17:34,924 --> 00:17:36,329
What happened now, Chala?

183
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:38,775
None of them has ever been
stronger than me,

184
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:42,425
because, at heart,
they are all children.

185
00:17:42,765 --> 00:17:46,015
There are four things
you need to bring up a child:

186
00:17:46,225 --> 00:17:51,355
a home, a school, rigor and affection.

187
00:17:52,565 --> 00:17:55,935
But outside that door,
there's the street,

188
00:17:55,985 --> 00:18:00,405
and a teacher needs to know
what's waiting for them out there.

189
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:03,195
In the past, life was clearer,

190
00:18:03,245 --> 00:18:07,325
and I knew what
I was preparing my students for.

191
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:10,655
Now, the only thing clear to me

192
00:18:10,705 --> 00:18:13,705
is what not to prepare them for.

193
00:18:26,975 --> 00:18:29,075
C'mon, move!

194
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,585
- No fear!
- What fear?

195
00:18:34,775 --> 00:18:37,680
The train is coming!
Hurry up, man!

196
00:18:39,065 --> 00:18:41,065
Look! For real!

197
00:18:42,945 --> 00:18:44,665
We gotta jump, man!

198
00:18:44,715 --> 00:18:46,815
Jump, it's going to kill me!

199
00:18:46,865 --> 00:18:48,315
Chala, jump!

200
00:18:48,365 --> 00:18:49,413
Be cool, man!

201
00:19:09,328 --> 00:19:11,195
They're so sharp, man!

202
00:19:11,245 --> 00:19:13,725
Sharp as knives, man.

203
00:19:14,855 --> 00:19:16,735
Look how sharp is the edge...

204
00:19:17,525 --> 00:19:19,105
The lineman!

205
00:19:24,195 --> 00:19:25,995
Look, it's Yeni!

206
00:19:26,905 --> 00:19:28,961
I bet you don't dare
to make a move.

207
00:19:29,285 --> 00:19:30,925
A pigeon if I do.

208
00:19:30,975 --> 00:19:33,875
Don't bluff! A pigeon
if she says yes, smartass.

209
00:19:34,425 --> 00:19:37,451
You can start saying goodbye
to your carrier pigeon then.

210
00:19:37,506 --> 00:19:39,665
But if she rejects you,
you'll owe me one.

211
00:19:39,715 --> 00:19:42,255
- You got it!
- Go tiger!

212
00:19:43,675 --> 00:19:46,365
- What are you doing around here?
- Waiting for you.

213
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:49,533
Listen, do you want
to be my girlfriend?

214
00:19:49,584 --> 00:19:50,995
Have you gone crazy?

215
00:19:51,045 --> 00:19:52,975
You wouldn't have
to walk by yourself...

216
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,775
- I like walking by myself.
- Yeni!

217
00:19:56,645 --> 00:19:59,305
If we were together nobody
would mess with you again.

218
00:19:59,355 --> 00:20:03,048
- Sure, â€˜cause you're such a champion.
- You know I am.

219
00:20:03,473 --> 00:20:06,100
That's why they're sending
you into re-education school.

220
00:20:06,445 --> 00:20:08,805
I'm gonna give you
till Monday to think about it.

221
00:20:08,855 --> 00:20:11,245
I have nothing to think about.

222
00:20:11,785 --> 00:20:16,915
This is for luck. You can give it back
when you decide to be my girlfriend.

223
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:23,625
Chala, can't you
understand the word "no"?

224
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:32,765
Slapped in the face, man!

225
00:20:32,845 --> 00:20:35,105
My pi-ge-on!

226
00:20:35,515 --> 00:20:37,384
You know she's just
playing hard to get.

227
00:20:37,435 --> 00:20:39,435
"Hard" was the slap
in the face you got!

228
00:20:39,485 --> 00:20:41,225
Man, don't you know
hate is the same as love?

229
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:43,615
- And love is the same as hate...
- Look at those punks!

230
00:20:44,445 --> 00:20:47,245
Learn to play basketball, old men!

231
00:20:47,295 --> 00:20:48,485
Punks!

232
00:20:50,455 --> 00:20:51,955
Oh, no. Here.

233
00:20:54,165 --> 00:20:56,865
- Thank you, Pablo.
- Glad to be of service, teacher.

234
00:20:56,915 --> 00:20:59,105
- Hope you get well soon.
- Thank you, Yeni.

235
00:20:59,255 --> 00:21:00,855
- See you later!
- See you later.

236
00:21:04,925 --> 00:21:06,885
- Carmela!
- Chala!

237
00:21:07,305 --> 00:21:10,305
- When are you coming back?
- I still can't.

238
00:21:10,555 --> 00:21:13,805
- We really need you...
- What did I say about the dogs?

239
00:21:13,935 --> 00:21:17,145
- This one is friendly, teach.
- I don't buy that.

240
00:21:17,315 --> 00:21:21,225
I've told you to not even say
"hello" when you are with them.

241
00:21:21,275 --> 00:21:24,315
- Let me help you.
- It's not necessary.

242
00:21:25,195 --> 00:21:28,695
And I hope not to hear
a complaint about you!

243
00:21:31,785 --> 00:21:32,995
Chala!

244
00:21:34,495 --> 00:21:36,493
I still don't dare
to go out by myself

245
00:21:36,543 --> 00:21:38,405
and I want to visit
Camilo tomorrow...

246
00:21:38,455 --> 00:21:40,955
Say no more!
I'm your guy!

247
00:21:42,415 --> 00:21:44,425
See you tomorrow, teach!

248
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:09,075
How is he doing, teach?

249
00:22:11,925 --> 00:22:13,675
So-so...

250
00:22:13,725 --> 00:22:15,955
What do you mean?

251
00:22:16,225 --> 00:22:19,035
Camilo is very sick, Chala.

252
00:22:21,045 --> 00:22:24,045
What's up, "girl"? You know
who not to mess with.

253
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,625
You're not crazy
enough to cut me.

254
00:22:29,045 --> 00:22:32,675
- Professor Marta can be such a pain.

255
00:22:33,015 --> 00:22:35,015
Hey! Look at this!

256
00:22:35,265 --> 00:22:38,425
- What's with the abuse, NiÃ±o?
- Get out of the way.

257
00:22:38,475 --> 00:22:40,225
Did you bring the spinning top?

258
00:22:40,395 --> 00:22:41,975
What are you betting this time?

259
00:22:42,271 --> 00:22:43,904
- A pigeon.
- You lost it already...

260
00:22:43,954 --> 00:22:45,293
Play!

261
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,795
This bottle top is blessed by me!

262
00:22:50,845 --> 00:22:52,845
Beat it, man!

263
00:22:56,225 --> 00:22:57,986
You lost!

264
00:23:01,415 --> 00:23:03,875
- Give the spinning top back.
- I'm not gonna pay.

265
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:05,415
I paid you, so come on!

266
00:23:05,465 --> 00:23:08,327
- What's your problem?
- You're finished!

267
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:15,225
Did you see, man?
C'mon.

268
00:23:21,185 --> 00:23:23,685
Hey! No do over?

269
00:23:24,645 --> 00:23:28,145
No, my "girl".
No revenge.

270
00:23:29,065 --> 00:23:32,695
Listen, man! Be careful
who you hang out with.

271
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:35,085
Do you know why
Yoan's old man is in jail?

272
00:23:35,135 --> 00:23:37,025
His father is more of a man than yours!

273
00:23:37,138 --> 00:23:39,075
Hey! What's the matter?

274
00:23:42,725 --> 00:23:44,725
Chala! Boy!

275
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:48,027
Hold him!

276
00:23:53,979 --> 00:23:56,731
- Chala's always getting into trouble.
- Don't say that!

277
00:23:56,781 --> 00:23:59,685
Stop! He did it to defend Yoan.

278
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,175
The new teacher was really worked up.

279
00:24:06,225 --> 00:24:09,775
- I told you, again and again, damn it.
- What did you want me to do...?

280
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:12,725
- It wasn't my fault.
- Sure, it's never your fault.

281
00:24:13,305 --> 00:24:15,075
The director stopped by to see you.

282
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:17,825
She says the social worker
is gonna be back too.

283
00:24:19,785 --> 00:24:23,995
Chala, didn't I say I didn't want
any more trouble with those people?

284
00:24:27,725 --> 00:24:30,545
Did you pay the electricity bill?

285
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:34,465
May I?

286
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:44,145
You're already inside, aren't you?

287
00:24:50,985 --> 00:24:53,775
I'm coming to see you
before you have a fit...

288
00:24:53,865 --> 00:24:55,945
The "24" came up.

289
00:24:57,405 --> 00:25:00,405
It's okay. I took my stakes
someplace else.

290
00:25:02,365 --> 00:25:05,005
I would like to know
who's helping you out with that...

291
00:25:05,455 --> 00:25:07,455
Never mind, man.

292
00:25:08,165 --> 00:25:10,655
I'm going into re-education school.

293
00:25:14,616 --> 00:25:16,595
I'll go as an intern...

294
00:25:17,255 --> 00:25:19,755
but I don't want you
to take the dogs away.

295
00:25:20,345 --> 00:25:22,175
What did you do now?

296
00:25:22,225 --> 00:25:25,124
Is this new teacher,
she's got it in for me.

297
00:25:27,575 --> 00:25:29,904
And who's going to
take care of the dogs?

298
00:25:29,954 --> 00:25:33,105
- Richard and Yoan.
- Forget about it...

299
00:25:33,275 --> 00:25:35,235
I've got enough with one kid.

300
00:25:35,405 --> 00:25:37,905
I need the money, man.

301
00:25:38,945 --> 00:25:40,736
I gotta help mom.

302
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:49,625
Maybe I'll find someone
to take care of them,

303
00:25:49,745 --> 00:25:53,245
but you'll have to work
twice as hard on the weekends.

304
00:26:06,145 --> 00:26:09,015
Harder! Harder!

305
00:26:12,275 --> 00:26:15,605
Look Ignacio! He is a beast!

306
00:26:18,485 --> 00:26:20,695
Chala! Chala!

307
00:26:24,955 --> 00:26:27,955
Fuck, man!
She saw him.

308
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:39,675
- Do you fight dogs?
- Nah, these are the neighbor's.

309
00:26:39,725 --> 00:26:42,925
My thing is pigeons.
Come with me...

310
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:45,625
Come, look...

311
00:26:49,575 --> 00:26:51,465
This one is a female.

312
00:26:51,515 --> 00:26:54,645
I can get 25 for
this one... "dollars".

313
00:26:58,735 --> 00:27:00,735
Touch it.

314
00:27:02,575 --> 00:27:05,075
Don't you like it?

315
00:27:14,525 --> 00:27:17,525
You're going to need
it in the new school.

316
00:27:17,965 --> 00:27:20,675
What about the question I asked?

317
00:27:22,425 --> 00:27:24,338
You know that I don't want
to be your girlfriend.

318
00:27:24,595 --> 00:27:27,375
- Now least of all, right?
- It's not like that.

319
00:27:28,725 --> 00:27:32,011
You don't need to worry, nobody is going
to give you a hard time at school.

320
00:27:32,105 --> 00:27:34,591
Is that what you think of me?

321
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:38,585
Fix that uniform.

322
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:40,655
- What are you looking at?
- Whatever the fuck I want!

323
00:28:40,755 --> 00:28:43,425
- Hey, come on!
- You'll see how things are in here.

324
00:28:43,475 --> 00:28:46,005
Fix your uniform.
Tuck your shirt.

325
00:28:48,225 --> 00:28:51,635
I'm fine, dear.
Don't worry about me.

326
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:56,605
These calls are too expensive.

327
00:28:58,315 --> 00:29:03,105
I'm not alone, people
are always stopping by.

328
00:29:04,235 --> 00:29:08,075
There, there, my soup is getting cold.

329
00:29:10,575 --> 00:29:12,575
Me too.

330
00:29:15,665 --> 00:29:17,915
Another kiss to Orlandito.

331
00:29:20,205 --> 00:29:22,505
God bless you.

332
00:29:57,225 --> 00:30:00,225
- The ball, "papi". The ball!
- Come and get it.

333
00:30:06,425 --> 00:30:08,215
Hey, what's going on here?

334
00:30:12,635 --> 00:30:15,265
What's going on?

335
00:30:15,385 --> 00:30:18,605
Hey, come!
Stand right there.

336
00:30:21,275 --> 00:30:23,435
Don't hold him. Let him go!

337
00:30:23,685 --> 00:30:26,695
Be careful, you're hitting me.

338
00:30:42,415 --> 00:30:44,045
Teacher!

339
00:30:47,505 --> 00:30:52,215
- How are you?
- Fine. But hurry up, you'll be late.

340
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:04,025
You seem better.

341
00:31:04,145 --> 00:31:06,445
How are you?

342
00:31:07,025 --> 00:31:09,105
I'm starting tomorrow.

343
00:31:09,905 --> 00:31:12,155
Don't you think is too soon?

344
00:31:12,525 --> 00:31:14,645
The school year is almost ending.

345
00:31:14,695 --> 00:31:18,325
But there's no rush.
The new teacher stands up for herself.

346
00:31:18,425 --> 00:31:21,785
Mercedes, I'm going crazy at home.

347
00:31:23,745 --> 00:31:26,045
It's going to be good for the kids.

348
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:28,387
Camilo's illness has affected them
very much.

349
00:31:28,738 --> 00:31:30,945
- Excuse me.
- Ah! Look, Carmela...

350
00:31:31,086 --> 00:31:32,725
This is Marta.

351
00:31:35,525 --> 00:31:39,435
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

352
00:31:39,805 --> 00:31:43,975
- Good morning!
- Teacher!

353
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:49,105
Sit down... Sit down!

354
00:31:52,195 --> 00:31:55,365
It's not like you loved me that much.

355
00:31:55,535 --> 00:31:57,115
How is Orlandito doing?

356
00:31:57,445 --> 00:32:01,995
He's very well. He calls every
weekend and says hello to all of you.

357
00:32:02,415 --> 00:32:06,209
Teacher, is it true that Camilo is going
to be discharged from the hospital?

358
00:32:06,835 --> 00:32:08,729
Well... starting tomorrow,

359
00:32:08,779 --> 00:32:11,635
Professor Carmela
will be teaching Humanities...

360
00:32:11,835 --> 00:32:15,169
...and Marta will be teaching Sciences.

361
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:19,215
Chala is missing.

362
00:32:19,408 --> 00:32:21,193
Yes, he is.

363
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:24,935
- Chala was sent to...
- Gaby!

364
00:32:25,575 --> 00:32:27,685
I'll explain everything right now.

365
00:32:28,985 --> 00:32:30,775
Yeni is also missing, teacher.

366
00:32:30,945 --> 00:32:34,275
- What's the matter with Yeni?
- That's why I went to see you before...

367
00:32:34,325 --> 00:32:38,321
This arrived while you were gone
and I sent her to look for her father.

368
00:32:50,525 --> 00:32:52,545
Good afternoon!

369
00:32:59,515 --> 00:33:02,765
They said you stopped by the market.
What happened?

370
00:33:03,095 --> 00:33:05,265
The teacher sent me to get you.

371
00:33:06,765 --> 00:33:10,159
- Is this about indiscipline?
- An inspection.

372
00:33:11,065 --> 00:33:14,065
They noticed something
is wrong with my registration.

373
00:33:20,495 --> 00:33:22,995
Let's see what we can do, sweetie.

374
00:33:23,575 --> 00:33:26,995
Truth is I'm embarrassed
to speak with Carmela again.

375
00:33:40,925 --> 00:33:42,572
Chala! Chala!

376
00:33:44,935 --> 00:33:46,292
Teacher.

377
00:33:47,895 --> 00:33:50,102
You play, twin.

378
00:33:56,525 --> 00:34:00,145
He was messing with Yoan's father.
What did you expect me to do?

379
00:34:00,195 --> 00:34:02,781
And the rest of the complaints?

380
00:34:04,245 --> 00:34:06,071
Wait for me outside.

381
00:34:10,654 --> 00:34:13,717
- Coffee?
- The doctor said I shouldn't.

382
00:34:17,385 --> 00:34:20,005
I was at his home, Carmela.

383
00:34:20,095 --> 00:34:22,595
This kid raises fighting dogs.

384
00:34:23,201 --> 00:34:26,095
Neither the mother nor the teacher
know what to do with him...

385
00:34:26,145 --> 00:34:28,475
- ... and on top of that...
- Excuse me, Carlos,

386
00:34:28,685 --> 00:34:30,216
but I am Chala's teacher,

387
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:34,135
and my name is not Carmela
if I don't know what to do with him.

388
00:34:34,185 --> 00:34:36,905
I know, but you weren't around...

389
00:34:36,985 --> 00:34:39,315
and the kid is a handful.

390
00:34:39,525 --> 00:34:42,070
I've already caught him twice
trying to escape.

391
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,665
Chala will not leave
his mother by herself.

392
00:34:44,955 --> 00:34:48,326
Did you know he's the one
that puts bread on the table?

393
00:34:49,285 --> 00:34:51,408
Another reason for him to be here.

394
00:34:51,575 --> 00:34:54,014
A kid shouldn't have
to take care of such things.

395
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:57,675
Wherever you put him,
reality will be waiting outside.

396
00:34:57,835 --> 00:35:00,833
There's nothing you can
do here to change that.

397
00:35:01,465 --> 00:35:03,562
Carmela, please...

398
00:35:04,675 --> 00:35:06,475
Look at his student record...

399
00:35:07,025 --> 00:35:10,189
- It's like a novel! - In which
I didn't write a single word...

400
00:35:10,515 --> 00:35:13,525
and I'm his teacher
since the fourth grade.

401
00:35:15,842 --> 00:35:20,937
I take full responsibility.
I'm taking him back with me.

402
00:35:24,405 --> 00:35:26,541
You know you can't do that.

403
00:35:28,615 --> 00:35:32,540
Carlos... you weren't
any better than Chala.

404
00:35:35,915 --> 00:35:38,675
Leave this to me, please.

405
00:35:39,675 --> 00:35:42,255
And have the Committee
go looking for me at the school.

406
00:35:51,025 --> 00:35:53,225
There's a taxi, teach!

407
00:35:53,565 --> 00:35:55,685
It's empty, stop it.

408
00:35:57,565 --> 00:35:59,091
Capitol?

409
00:36:00,445 --> 00:36:02,262
- Get in, teach.
- Up! Up!

410
00:36:05,905 --> 00:36:08,455
- Ma'am! Shut the door gently...
- Oh, I'm sorry.

411
00:36:08,575 --> 00:36:12,035
- Can you please turn the volume down?
- But it is good, Carmela!

412
00:36:12,245 --> 00:36:14,322
Good is what's coming at you.

413
00:36:16,601 --> 00:36:19,995
First of all, you will have all of your
class notes up to date by Monday.

414
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:21,823
On with the abuse.

415
00:36:23,135 --> 00:36:25,085
Do you want to go back?

416
00:36:29,722 --> 00:36:31,772
And I'm going to find you a tutor.

417
00:36:32,145 --> 00:36:34,765
I don't need a tutor,
I can study by myself.

418
00:36:34,855 --> 00:36:37,178
Really?
With the dogs?

419
00:36:39,485 --> 00:36:43,575
I also need you to help me run
some errands. I mustn't strain myself.

420
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:45,395
More abuse?

421
00:36:45,825 --> 00:36:48,165
"Children exploitation"
is the name for it, right?

422
00:36:48,215 --> 00:36:51,861
- Boy, do as your grandmother says.
- She is not my grandmother!

423
00:37:02,045 --> 00:37:03,941
But I wish she was.

424
00:38:10,902 --> 00:38:12,400
Did you escape?

425
00:38:16,205 --> 00:38:17,776
What do you think?

426
00:38:20,495 --> 00:38:24,375
Chala...
you're driving me crazy.

427
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:27,439
You've always been crazy.

428
00:40:19,344 --> 00:40:21,004
What are you doing here?

429
00:40:21,165 --> 00:40:23,027
Do you always ask the same question?

430
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:25,495
You escaped.

431
00:40:26,335 --> 00:40:27,864
You too?

432
00:40:31,006 --> 00:40:31,823
Yeni!

433
00:40:34,345 --> 00:40:36,641
That day, why did you came
to return the bracelet?

434
00:40:49,306 --> 00:40:51,988
Raquel, one thing is to have
Chala on the street by himself

435
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:53,685
and another when Carmela is around.

436
00:40:53,735 --> 00:40:58,525
Look, you know all of the work
we do before deciding to intern a boy.

437
00:40:58,575 --> 00:41:02,205
And Carmela is much respected,
but she has become a problem.

438
00:41:02,415 --> 00:41:04,115
- Again?
- Teacher, but I...!

439
00:41:04,411 --> 00:41:07,106
Don't even think about it.
Wait for me in the office.

440
00:41:08,295 --> 00:41:10,125
Well, then, what
are you going to do?

441
00:41:10,255 --> 00:41:12,255
The boy has to come back.

442
00:41:12,545 --> 00:41:14,835
And we need to have
a meeting with Carmela.

443
00:41:15,345 --> 00:41:17,958
Okay, you let me know.

444
00:41:46,025 --> 00:41:48,085
I don't know
when I'll be finishing today.

445
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:51,375
But don't worry,
I'll go and try to fix this at school.

446
00:41:54,675 --> 00:41:58,675
[NATIONAL ANTHEM]

447
00:42:06,099 --> 00:42:09,895
- Pioneers for Communism!:
We will be like Ché!

448
00:42:10,426 --> 00:42:12,580
Are we getting an Argentinean passport?

449
00:42:15,905 --> 00:42:19,171
- What are you doing here?
- Ask Carmela.

450
00:42:23,483 --> 00:42:25,978
MarÃ­a Paula, get them inside please.

451
00:42:38,575 --> 00:42:41,045
I'm sorry, Marta.
You arrived during the morning meeting

452
00:42:41,095 --> 00:42:43,305
- ... and I had no time to let you know.
- Good morning!

453
00:42:43,475 --> 00:42:45,587
Mercedes, if Carmela is coming back

454
00:42:45,638 --> 00:42:48,775
and she has the right
to do as she pleases then,

455
00:42:48,855 --> 00:42:53,046
- I think I'm not needed anymore.
- Everybody is needed here.

456
00:42:55,553 --> 00:42:58,542
And Chala is not stronger than us.

457
00:42:59,195 --> 00:43:01,774
Carmela, this is not only about us.

458
00:43:02,115 --> 00:43:05,405
- Have you seen how that boy lives?
- What do you know about Chala's life?

459
00:43:05,495 --> 00:43:08,615
- I know he needs help.
- Yeni needs help as well,

460
00:43:08,665 --> 00:43:10,515
and she's the best of the class.

461
00:43:10,745 --> 00:43:14,365
What did you do for her yesterday?
Send her to fetch her father?

462
00:43:14,705 --> 00:43:17,220
They have no official
address in Havana.

463
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:20,135
Her father came to me,
so that I would register her.

464
00:43:20,255 --> 00:43:23,415
What's the matter with that?
They are from Holguin, is that it?

465
00:43:23,465 --> 00:43:25,794
Isn't HolguÃ­n a province of Cuba?

466
00:43:26,589 --> 00:43:28,935
Excuse me, but we
were talking about Chala.

467
00:43:29,095 --> 00:43:32,475
If you want a delinquent,
treat him as a delinquent.

468
00:43:33,105 --> 00:43:36,105
And Chala is not the only kid
we have with motives to become one.

469
00:43:36,275 --> 00:43:37,779
Please, Carmela.

470
00:43:39,035 --> 00:43:43,115
None of this was done lightly.
I agreed to do it.

471
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:46,635
Excuse me, Mercedes,
but we'll discuss that later.

472
00:43:47,535 --> 00:43:49,286
Did Yeni show up today?

473
00:43:51,035 --> 00:43:53,370
We have to take care of that then.

474
00:44:02,425 --> 00:44:04,255
Good afternoon Pablo.
How are you?

475
00:44:04,305 --> 00:44:06,775
- Good afternoon teacher.
- I'm here to see about Yeni.

476
00:44:06,805 --> 00:44:08,142
Oh, yes.

477
00:44:12,679 --> 00:44:16,815
Yeni, dear, get some water for me.
It's not easy to get here...

478
00:44:16,847 --> 00:44:18,276
- Yes.
- Take a seat, professor.

479
00:44:21,235 --> 00:44:24,097
I've tried everything but...

480
00:44:25,441 --> 00:44:28,557
There's no way to legalize
our occupancy here in Havana.

481
00:44:29,455 --> 00:44:33,720
The one thing that can't happen
is Yeni skipping school.

482
00:44:35,585 --> 00:44:38,081
You saved our lives
when you registered her,

483
00:44:38,715 --> 00:44:40,451
but now I've gotten you into trouble.

484
00:44:40,516 --> 00:44:42,842
Then don't make me look bad, Pablo.

485
00:44:43,175 --> 00:44:46,092
I expect to see Yeni
at school tomorrow.

486
00:44:48,675 --> 00:44:51,743
- Doesn't the noise bother you?
- I hardly notice it.

487
00:44:52,515 --> 00:44:54,715
She comes and goes alone
from school every day?

488
00:44:54,765 --> 00:44:56,804
No. We come home together.

489
00:44:57,145 --> 00:45:00,402
When I get out of school,
I have choir lessons or dance lessons.

490
00:45:00,453 --> 00:45:02,735
And then I go by the market
and pick him up.

491
00:45:02,815 --> 00:45:06,771
- That way I can take care of him.
- What do you mean?

492
00:45:07,535 --> 00:45:10,005
The police never messes with him
when we are together.

493
00:45:10,055 --> 00:45:12,944
Because they know me by now.
They know I'm just making a living.

494
00:45:13,075 --> 00:45:16,575
And most of them come from
the same place as we do. Do you know?

495
00:45:18,555 --> 00:45:21,139
But "servants make the worse masters".

496
00:45:24,795 --> 00:45:28,777
Let's see. Who's going to comment
on today's José MartÃ­'s quote?

497
00:45:30,385 --> 00:45:33,365
- Cristian.
- I believe there's only one homeland.

498
00:45:33,415 --> 00:45:36,425
Homeland is the place
where one is born and lives.

499
00:45:36,613 --> 00:45:40,475
The friends, the neighborhood,
the people... Everything!

500
00:45:40,676 --> 00:45:43,468
For instance, I have an uncle
who lives in the United States,

501
00:45:43,521 --> 00:45:47,625
but he says he always
carries Cuba in his heart.

502
00:45:47,925 --> 00:45:49,724
That's very good, Cristian.

503
00:45:50,496 --> 00:45:52,810
Anybody has a different point of view?

504
00:45:53,615 --> 00:45:54,909
Excuse me.

505
00:45:56,049 --> 00:45:57,312
Excuse me!

506
00:46:00,755 --> 00:46:03,104
They just called from the hospital...

507
00:46:05,335 --> 00:46:06,733
He died.

508
00:46:07,741 --> 00:46:09,845
They're talking about Camilo.

509
00:46:33,705 --> 00:46:39,380
You knew Camilo
had been sick for months.

510
00:46:42,081 --> 00:46:44,532
The doctors did
everything they could.

511
00:46:46,872 --> 00:46:50,565
But sometimes that's not enough.

512
00:47:48,787 --> 00:47:51,229
I hate it when people
call me "Palestinian".

513
00:47:52,181 --> 00:47:55,680
And when I first came to this school
everybody called me that.

514
00:47:56,831 --> 00:47:59,575
But Camilo gave me this card
of the Virgin of Charity

515
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:03,336
and said she was
the patron of all Cubans.

516
00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:06,246
He took me to the church
for the first time.

517
00:48:08,063 --> 00:48:10,617
That's why I put the card on the mural.

518
00:48:18,235 --> 00:48:20,404
Do you want me to serve the food?

519
00:48:24,649 --> 00:48:26,991
Come on. Come on.

520
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:40,770
Mom!

521
00:49:01,975 --> 00:49:04,055
We're more comfortable here.

522
00:49:04,935 --> 00:49:05,769
What is this?

523
00:49:07,245 --> 00:49:08,935
Put it back, please.

524
00:49:09,062 --> 00:49:11,043
- But this...
- Please!

525
00:49:15,945 --> 00:49:19,745
Carmela, you know perfectly
well you can't do this.

526
00:49:20,035 --> 00:49:24,525
- I can't, but the children can.
- Look, let me explain what happened...

527
00:49:24,575 --> 00:49:26,861
Excuse me, Mercedes,
but there's no explanation

528
00:49:26,956 --> 00:49:30,575
for the presence of that image
in the mural of one of our classrooms.

529
00:49:30,625 --> 00:49:34,047
There are so many unexplainable
things that I've been forced to do.

530
00:49:35,027 --> 00:49:37,744
Let's try and keep
to the matter in hand.

531
00:49:38,715 --> 00:49:41,036
You asked me to be here
to discuss about Chala.

532
00:49:44,368 --> 00:49:45,629
Very well.

533
00:49:46,671 --> 00:49:48,557
The decision of sending him off to you

534
00:49:48,608 --> 00:49:51,109
was taken after thorough consideration
of his student record

535
00:49:51,938 --> 00:49:56,348
by the school, the social worker,
the local police, the psychologist...

536
00:49:56,438 --> 00:50:02,228
I know he's not a saint!
But I also know he has moral values,

537
00:50:02,405 --> 00:50:04,265
that he didn't pick up at home.

538
00:50:04,558 --> 00:50:07,867
But re-education school is not going
to take that away from him...

539
00:50:07,907 --> 00:50:11,227
Re-education school
would be another mark in his life.

540
00:50:11,705 --> 00:50:13,956
Whether we like it or not,
it marginalizes him.

541
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:17,731
I was his mother's teacher.
I've been his since three years ago.

542
00:50:17,845 --> 00:50:19,775
None of you know
him better than I do.

543
00:50:19,825 --> 00:50:23,229
But we cannot set in motion
such a serious process like this

544
00:50:23,483 --> 00:50:25,371
and then pull back three weeks later.

545
00:50:26,595 --> 00:50:30,259
That's because you're thinking
about how this makes you look,

546
00:50:31,203 --> 00:50:33,430
and I'm thinking on
what's the best for the boy.

547
00:50:36,139 --> 00:50:40,676
Carmela, you know
you're much respected,

548
00:50:41,761 --> 00:50:45,654
but there are too many problems
in your class.

549
00:50:46,372 --> 00:50:48,690
We cannot allow that to you.

550
00:50:49,277 --> 00:50:52,127
Excuse me, but you don't get
to "allow" things in my class.

551
00:50:52,795 --> 00:50:55,177
I've been teaching since
before you were born.

552
00:50:57,671 --> 00:50:59,984
Maybe it has been too long.

553
00:51:02,697 --> 00:51:05,195
Not as long as the
people who rule this country.

554
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:07,736
Do you think that's too long?

555
00:51:15,525 --> 00:51:19,332
You talk to her.
The last thing I would like to do...

556
00:51:19,655 --> 00:51:22,011
is being forced to
take action on Carmela.

557
00:51:42,228 --> 00:51:44,332
No two classes are the same,

558
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:49,485
and each one of them has children
that will leave a mark on you forever.

559
00:51:50,449 --> 00:51:53,973
This is the class in which
I had to teach my own grandson.

560
00:51:54,395 --> 00:51:56,641
With him, it's been
seven of my students

561
00:51:56,692 --> 00:51:58,978
that have left Cuba
in the past three years.

562
00:51:59,855 --> 00:52:02,865
One speaks about MartÃ­
and the motherland.

563
00:52:02,985 --> 00:52:06,172
But at home, their families
are digging up dead people

564
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:07,845
to become Spanish citizens.

565
00:52:09,186 --> 00:52:11,651
This was also Camilo's class,

566
00:52:12,771 --> 00:52:14,686
who taught them about death.

567
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:18,875
Yoan's class, with his father
in prison because of political reasons.

568
00:52:19,541 --> 00:52:22,445
Yeni's class. A great student...

569
00:52:23,358 --> 00:52:25,988
who has to bear the cross
of being called "Palestinian".

570
00:52:27,335 --> 00:52:30,858
And, of course... Chala's class.

571
00:52:32,721 --> 00:52:37,972
The class in which there's an image
of the Virgin of Charity on the mural.

572
00:52:43,235 --> 00:52:48,227
And no God to remove it
as long as the teacher is Carmela.

573
00:52:49,365 --> 00:52:52,000
A synonymous of "servile"?

574
00:52:54,915 --> 00:52:57,819
I'll go. "Asslicker" and "asskisser"!

575
00:52:59,525 --> 00:53:05,425
Good, there's those two.
But there are others...

576
00:53:07,925 --> 00:53:09,473
This is the last of the errands, teach.

577
00:53:09,584 --> 00:53:13,595
Yes, but I'll still be checking
your class notes on Monday.

578
00:53:14,893 --> 00:53:17,085
- Come on, give me.
- Be careful, it weighs.

579
00:53:17,135 --> 00:53:19,909
- Don't worry. See you tomorrow.
- Bye, teach.

580
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:25,942
The truth is I didn't like
how things went last time.

581
00:53:26,405 --> 00:53:28,686
- We can agree on that.
- Thank you.

582
00:53:33,058 --> 00:53:35,154
But I'm also doing my job,

583
00:53:36,035 --> 00:53:39,613
and unfortunately, re-education
school is the best option for Chala.

584
00:53:40,825 --> 00:53:44,571
"Unfortunately",
Chala has no options at all, Raquel.

585
00:53:45,541 --> 00:53:48,604
Neither does
an excellent student as Yeni.

586
00:53:49,015 --> 00:53:54,453
Carmela, there's an infraction
in her registration and you know it.

587
00:53:55,855 --> 00:53:59,568
Can I speak the truth...?
I don't care.

588
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:02,729
The only thing that matters to me

589
00:54:02,755 --> 00:54:05,279
is the opportunity
we're giving to a student like her.

590
00:54:07,405 --> 00:54:09,826
Maybe something can be done
about Yeni...

591
00:54:10,556 --> 00:54:12,470
But what about the religious image?

592
00:54:12,969 --> 00:54:16,105
We both know they're not going
to let us get away with it.

593
00:54:16,581 --> 00:54:20,120
The thing is that it has to go
as naturally as it arrived.

594
00:54:23,036 --> 00:54:25,717
Couldn't that be before the inspection?

595
00:54:26,722 --> 00:54:28,077
I don't know.

596
00:54:31,246 --> 00:54:33,359
What should we do then, Carmela?

597
00:54:35,547 --> 00:54:38,865
Raquel, as we both know,

598
00:54:39,668 --> 00:54:42,488
each one of us must do its own duty.

599
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:58,140
Look who showed up!

600
00:55:02,435 --> 00:55:03,959
Find a stick.

601
00:55:04,359 --> 00:55:06,795
Be careful, there's a cop in the corner.

602
00:55:07,085 --> 00:55:08,299
What are you looking at?

603
00:55:10,325 --> 00:55:12,758
Easy, NiÃ±o, the cop is watching.

604
00:55:13,982 --> 00:55:15,625
I'll see you tomorrow at the bay.

605
00:55:15,675 --> 00:55:17,041
You got it!

606
00:55:18,435 --> 00:55:20,618
After sports class. Get it?

607
00:55:21,455 --> 00:55:22,892
<i>Chala! Chala!</i>

608
00:55:30,135 --> 00:55:31,699
Chala, don't!

609
00:55:38,578 --> 00:55:41,117
Come back, Chala!

610
00:55:45,965 --> 00:55:47,463
Come back!

611
00:56:21,881 --> 00:56:24,032
Hey man, slow down,
we're not gonna make it.

612
00:56:24,075 --> 00:56:26,350
- Fuck, we're beaten!
- You're beaten!

613
00:56:30,308 --> 00:56:32,960
Go to the buoy!
Swim towards the buoy!

614
00:56:34,035 --> 00:56:35,753
The buoy is closer, c'mon.

615
00:56:50,525 --> 00:56:52,725
Swim, you can do it!

616
00:56:53,175 --> 00:56:54,683
I can't...!

617
00:56:54,972 --> 00:56:56,043
Don't be nervous.

618
00:57:01,605 --> 00:57:02,877
Help me...

619
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:07,101
I can't...!

620
00:57:09,485 --> 00:57:12,485
C'mon, grab my foot!
You can do it, c'mon!

621
00:57:25,634 --> 00:57:28,455
- They're in big trouble.
- At least they won't drown.

622
00:57:28,505 --> 00:57:30,705
They're taking them!
C'mon!

623
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,822
Captaincy calling the police...

624
00:57:45,275 --> 00:57:47,237
There was a call from the Municipality.

625
00:57:49,728 --> 00:57:51,760
Raquel is coming to meet me.

626
00:57:51,964 --> 00:57:54,305
Why don't we seize
the opportunity and talk to her?

627
00:57:54,935 --> 00:57:58,366
No Mercedes,
let's not make it worse.

628
00:57:58,411 --> 00:58:00,943
You know we're not going
to understand each other.

629
00:58:02,025 --> 00:58:03,832
I'm going to pick up my daughter.

630
00:58:04,195 --> 00:58:07,179
If Raquel gets here before I do,
tell her to wait for me.

631
00:58:14,865 --> 00:58:16,439
What?

632
00:58:18,075 --> 00:58:20,282
What's on "Secret Friend" this week?

633
00:58:22,955 --> 00:58:26,155
"A small gesture to make you smile".

634
00:58:30,675 --> 00:58:32,133
Excuse me...

635
00:58:32,635 --> 00:58:34,675
Can I see you for a minute, teacher?

636
00:58:37,895 --> 00:58:39,269
Hey!

637
00:58:42,565 --> 00:58:44,158
I'm aware of everything.

638
00:58:44,235 --> 00:58:47,305
I know you don't like it when
I take him to the police station

639
00:58:47,355 --> 00:58:48,617
but he's going too far.

640
00:58:48,702 --> 00:58:51,813
There's nothing you could do that would
be worse than what awaits him here.

641
00:58:52,655 --> 00:58:56,114
I left the other one with his folks.
But what should I do with him?

642
00:58:56,339 --> 00:58:57,897
Leave him with me, please.

643
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:00,143
This is the last time
I bring him to you.

644
00:59:00,198 --> 00:59:02,531
And you know I've tried everything.

645
00:59:05,045 --> 00:59:07,184
I'm glad you're a witness.

646
00:59:13,465 --> 00:59:15,538
Yeni, go home.

647
00:59:20,798 --> 00:59:23,195
- Have you lost your mind?
- But it wasn't at school!

648
00:59:23,241 --> 00:59:25,266
- So what?
- He had no reason to bring me to you!

649
00:59:25,323 --> 00:59:28,323
- To whom, then?
- Nobody, I don't need anybody!

650
00:59:29,195 --> 00:59:31,555
Don't raise your voice at me,
damn it!

651
00:59:35,269 --> 00:59:36,934
It makes me furious.

652
00:59:38,471 --> 00:59:40,332
I don't like seeing you like this.

653
00:59:46,275 --> 00:59:48,324
Wait for me at home.

654
00:59:51,295 --> 00:59:53,842
Tell your mom we need to talk.

655
01:00:09,575 --> 01:00:11,815
Are you going out like that?

656
01:00:13,873 --> 01:00:16,107
Carmela said
she was coming to see you.

657
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:22,894
Chala, I said I didn't want
any more trouble with Carmela.

658
01:00:23,375 --> 01:00:26,630
Sure. You just don't want her
to see you like that.

659
01:01:13,995 --> 01:01:16,557
- Let me help you.
- It's not necessary.

660
01:01:20,675 --> 01:01:22,991
Where's your mother, Chala?

661
01:01:29,065 --> 01:01:31,944
- How are you, Carmela?
- So-so.

662
01:01:33,976 --> 01:01:36,834
Do you have any idea
of where Sonia could be?

663
01:01:37,667 --> 01:01:39,366
I haven't seen her today.

664
01:01:40,088 --> 01:01:42,215
Chala, I'll bring him back later.

665
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:52,655
Ignacio...

666
01:01:57,925 --> 01:02:00,040
You have to help me out with Chala.

667
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,774
I'm sorry Carmela,
but Chala is not my problem.

668
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:05,924
Some people think he is.

669
01:02:07,305 --> 01:02:10,105
You know not even the mother
is certain of it.

670
01:02:10,725 --> 01:02:13,105
I've been taking care of them anyway...

671
01:02:13,275 --> 01:02:15,095
Really, Ignacio?

672
01:02:16,905 --> 01:02:20,865
- That family lives on what I pay Chala.
- But he's not old enough for that.

673
01:02:21,011 --> 01:02:24,889
Chala's not old enough for many things,
but he still has to deal with them.

674
01:02:25,365 --> 01:02:30,119
If the mother could, she would sell him
to buy some more of that crap she uses.

675
01:02:36,366 --> 01:02:39,316
Do you think a dog fight
is a place for a child?

676
01:02:44,475 --> 01:02:46,394
Worse is a dog's life, Carmela.

677
01:02:47,019 --> 01:02:49,105
At least, he's fed
because of the fights.

678
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:53,678
Ignacio, you and I both know
that Chala deserves a chance.

679
01:02:56,275 --> 01:02:58,221
That's why we are giving it to him.

680
01:02:59,235 --> 01:03:01,368
Each one of us in our own way.

681
01:03:16,175 --> 01:03:19,169
- Forgive me, son.
- Why?

682
01:03:23,385 --> 01:03:25,453
Because I have no right to hurt you.

683
01:03:25,775 --> 01:03:28,227
And all the strokes with the ruler
you give me!

684
01:03:28,314 --> 01:03:31,426
- It's not the same.
- The ruler hurts more...

685
01:03:32,543 --> 01:03:35,283
It hurts me more
to lay a hand on you.

686
01:03:39,655 --> 01:03:42,369
I don't deserve
what you're doing for me.

687
01:03:43,075 --> 01:03:45,401
Wouldn't you do anything for me?

688
01:03:48,615 --> 01:03:51,317
Who was the only student
to visit me in the hospital?

689
01:03:53,205 --> 01:03:56,865
They wouldn't let me see you,
but I talked my way in.

690
01:03:58,085 --> 01:03:59,965
Oh, Chala, my boy...!

691
01:04:05,805 --> 01:04:09,005
You gotta help me!
If you don't, we're screwed.

692
01:04:44,935 --> 01:04:47,023
That rascal caught me old.

693
01:04:47,505 --> 01:04:51,109
I swear it's the first time
I lay a hand on a kid.

694
01:04:51,935 --> 01:04:54,125
You get too much involved, Carmela.

695
01:04:55,185 --> 01:04:58,693
And this proves that Chala will be
better off in a re-education school.

696
01:04:58,815 --> 01:05:01,855
What Chala needs,
we have to give it to him.

697
01:05:02,775 --> 01:05:04,975
I'm sorry, but I disagree.

698
01:05:06,445 --> 01:05:09,772
And we could have handled
the card thing in a different way, too...

699
01:05:10,905 --> 01:05:15,623
I'm not going to push things
just because somebody else is pushing us.

700
01:05:16,975 --> 01:05:19,111
I'm not being pushed by anybody.

701
01:05:21,255 --> 01:05:22,870
I hope so.

702
01:05:25,271 --> 01:05:27,248
See you tomorrow, Carmela.

703
01:05:33,345 --> 01:05:35,916
Inside! Come on! Inside!

704
01:05:40,065 --> 01:05:45,168
During recess, each one of you
left a present

705
01:05:45,565 --> 01:05:48,184
for your secret friend
beneath their seat.

706
01:05:48,775 --> 01:05:50,664
I was going to wait
till the school's out,

707
01:05:52,825 --> 01:05:56,023
but I see you're not going
to wait that long.

708
01:06:00,585 --> 01:06:04,385
You have... two minutes
to scratch the itch!

709
01:06:20,907 --> 01:06:23,099
- Let me see!
- Here.

710
01:06:25,925 --> 01:06:28,645
"When you get out of school,
look inside your backpack. "

711
01:06:28,695 --> 01:06:31,415
- C'mon! What are you waiting for?
- For us to be alone.

712
01:06:31,535 --> 01:06:34,520
- C'mon, girl! There's no one here.
- What if we're being watched?

713
01:06:35,655 --> 01:06:39,655
- Let me see, man.
- Look! Come!

714
01:06:45,388 --> 01:06:47,909
I can't wait to know what it is!

715
01:06:53,483 --> 01:06:55,683
Look, here's fine.

716
01:06:58,975 --> 01:07:00,864
They're gonna see you.

717
01:07:02,395 --> 01:07:04,137
- Hurry!
- Wait.

718
01:07:08,246 --> 01:07:09,397
It's so beautiful!

719
01:07:09,457 --> 01:07:14,473
Man! You really worked it!
She's hooked!

720
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:18,825
- Look at that.
- Look at her face.

721
01:07:19,575 --> 01:07:21,741
Do you know who gave it to you?

722
01:07:23,336 --> 01:07:24,439
The fan is nice, uh?

723
01:07:24,844 --> 01:07:28,144
Listen, man, don't you wanna be
my secret friend?

724
01:08:16,311 --> 01:08:19,811
- Bro, isn't that your old man?
- He's out!

725
01:08:20,515 --> 01:08:23,805
- Hey, dad!
- Hey! What a surprise, boy!

726
01:08:28,625 --> 01:08:30,847
I missed you!
Where's your mom?

727
01:08:33,385 --> 01:08:36,449
- You'll see how grown
my little sister is! - Really?

728
01:08:49,646 --> 01:08:53,644
Fellows, this is our most
experienced and prestigious teacher

729
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,132
we're talking about.

730
01:08:56,425 --> 01:08:58,473
That's why we asked for this meeting.

731
01:08:59,575 --> 01:09:01,125
How old is Carmela?

732
01:09:01,175 --> 01:09:04,043
She could have retired
like ten years ago.

733
01:09:04,867 --> 01:09:07,050
And her heart attack was pretty serious.

734
01:09:07,179 --> 01:09:08,867
I don't know if we're all

735
01:09:09,315 --> 01:09:12,805
in the same page,
but retirement could be a good option.

736
01:09:12,855 --> 01:09:15,431
With all of the recognition
that she deserves, of course.

737
01:09:16,714 --> 01:09:20,609
I have noticed that here, today,
two of us are her former students.

738
01:09:21,189 --> 01:09:24,439
Excuse me. How is that
related to the matter in hand?

739
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:25,840
It cannot be a coincidence.

740
01:09:26,221 --> 01:09:29,209
Vocation is born in the presence
of teachers like her.

741
01:09:29,795 --> 01:09:32,141
Look, I've known Carmela since I was...

742
01:09:32,192 --> 01:09:36,332
shorter than this table, and I can
assure you she's as capable as ever.

743
01:09:36,575 --> 01:09:39,596
- Fighting for her children and...
- Cut to the chase, please!

744
01:09:39,991 --> 01:09:42,834
I don't think Carmela
deserves to be forced into retirement.

745
01:09:43,103 --> 01:09:45,040
So, if this is what
we're talking about,

746
01:09:45,091 --> 01:09:46,587
I tell you I'm not okay with it.

747
01:09:47,205 --> 01:09:50,094
No, Carlos.
What we're talking about is finding

748
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:52,482
a decent way out
for an exemplary teacher

749
01:09:52,935 --> 01:09:55,225
who is been acting on
her own for years now.

750
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:57,442
A teacher not acting on her own...

751
01:09:57,545 --> 01:10:00,273
- That's enough, Carlos!
- Fellows, please!

752
01:10:01,566 --> 01:10:03,836
We cannot lose sight
of our strategy right now:

753
01:10:03,862 --> 01:10:06,477
getting experienced educators
back in the classrooms.

754
01:10:09,585 --> 01:10:13,875
Suppose we turn
a blind eye on Carmela again.

755
01:10:15,675 --> 01:10:19,245
What would happen
if the Committee finds a religious image

756
01:10:19,342 --> 01:10:21,167
on the mural
of one of our classrooms?

757
01:10:21,219 --> 01:10:22,157
Oh, please...!

758
01:10:22,765 --> 01:10:26,215
I'm the director of that same school
and I practice santerÃ­a!

759
01:10:26,265 --> 01:10:28,747
Mercedes, everybody has
their own thing!

760
01:10:29,629 --> 01:10:32,200
But they're not going to let us
get away with this.

761
01:10:32,685 --> 01:10:34,535
You'll have to excuse me then.

762
01:10:34,994 --> 01:10:38,754
But I don't want to be here if Carmela
is not sitting at the table too.

763
01:10:39,865 --> 01:10:41,661
Excuse me for a minute.

764
01:10:47,535 --> 01:10:48,810
Mercedes!

765
01:10:50,665 --> 01:10:52,538
I wouldn't have asked for meeting

766
01:10:52,578 --> 01:10:54,816
if I hadn't exhausted
every option with Carmela.

767
01:10:55,965 --> 01:10:58,244
I still don't want to be
a part of this, Raquel.

768
01:10:59,885 --> 01:11:01,395
Do you have a better idea?

769
01:11:03,595 --> 01:11:05,414
Carmela is one of your teachers.

770
01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:06,762
If I have to intervene

771
01:11:07,461 --> 01:11:10,405
is only because you weren't
capable of solving the problem.

772
01:11:16,645 --> 01:11:20,445
- I'm not going to accept it, Mercedes.
- I know you'll put up a fight.

773
01:11:22,735 --> 01:11:25,041
We cannot let the children know.

774
01:11:31,705 --> 01:11:34,284
Forgive me for all the trouble
I'm causing you.

775
01:11:35,715 --> 01:11:37,961
You've always been a troublemaker.

776
01:11:39,075 --> 01:11:41,713
But you're damn giving me
a hard time this year, old woman!

777
01:11:43,025 --> 01:11:45,838
- Do you know what the matter is?
- You're taking a stand.

778
01:11:47,805 --> 01:11:50,231
You got fed up
and you're taking a stand.

779
01:11:52,193 --> 01:11:55,924
But remember you're not the only one
facing the consequences.

780
01:12:00,235 --> 01:12:02,678
Everything has dropped
on me at once Mercedes.

781
01:12:04,235 --> 01:12:07,381
And it's been too many years
fighting against too much shit.

782
01:12:11,115 --> 01:12:14,059
Don't repeat that if you're not
thinking about retirement.

783
01:12:14,955 --> 01:12:18,837
- You're killing me with this equation!
- Gimme that, man!

784
01:12:20,585 --> 01:12:22,785
You girls are playing smart!

785
01:12:26,635 --> 01:12:28,875
- Yoan!
- Pay attention!

786
01:12:28,925 --> 01:12:30,092
Write "24" like she did!

787
01:12:30,785 --> 01:12:32,006
I'm done!

788
01:12:32,305 --> 01:12:35,645
This is too hard!

789
01:12:35,875 --> 01:12:39,367
You're the best!
The girls are up by ten.

790
01:12:39,775 --> 01:12:41,901
- You're pathetic.
- Beat ya.

791
01:12:42,105 --> 01:12:43,879
You lost!

792
01:12:44,565 --> 01:12:46,185
- See?
- It's your fault.

793
01:12:46,235 --> 01:12:49,896
My fault? You ignorant...!
I got everything right.

794
01:12:50,495 --> 01:12:51,805
Let me see...

795
01:12:55,455 --> 01:12:56,990
It's true.

796
01:12:59,192 --> 01:13:03,002
That's why I'm telling Carmela tomorrow
that you don't need more tutoring.

797
01:13:03,613 --> 01:13:05,522
Don't. It would make me sad.

798
01:13:10,265 --> 01:13:12,665
Come, MarÃ­a Paula,
I'm gonna show you something.

799
01:13:12,715 --> 01:13:15,266
- What?
- Just something! In the balcony. C'mon!

800
01:13:15,831 --> 01:13:17,142
C'mon.

801
01:13:24,105 --> 01:13:25,921
It's hot inside!

802
01:13:32,487 --> 01:13:34,432
Aren't you pretty?

803
01:13:35,593 --> 01:13:37,307
Never get tired of telling the same?

804
01:13:39,367 --> 01:13:43,131
If I got tired you
would die of sadness.

805
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:04,838
Do you know who your secret friend is?

806
01:14:07,275 --> 01:14:09,126
I know mine...

807
01:14:10,535 --> 01:14:13,005
It's the boy with the worst
handwriting of the class.

808
01:14:18,515 --> 01:14:20,698
And you're the best
flamenco dancer in the world.

809
01:14:42,525 --> 01:14:45,745
- Hey, Chala! - Man, I'm gonna
throw you out the balcony!

810
01:14:46,025 --> 01:14:49,081
There's a lot of yelling upstairs!
It must be a fight. C'mon!

811
01:15:08,675 --> 01:15:11,786
- Chala, I don't like this.
- I want to leave now.

812
01:15:12,135 --> 01:15:14,349
You can't leave now.

813
01:15:16,765 --> 01:15:18,330
Let's go, MarÃ­a Paula.

814
01:15:24,105 --> 01:15:25,927
- Yeni!
- Hey, "papi"!

815
01:15:31,125 --> 01:15:33,040
- Yeni!
- Let go of me!

816
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:35,970
- What's wrong? - If you fight dogs
I can't be your girlfriend.

817
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:37,905
- I don't fight dogs!
- Oh, really?

818
01:15:37,955 --> 01:15:40,612
- I take care of them.
- So others can fight them.

819
01:15:41,575 --> 01:15:43,225
It's the same, Chala!

820
01:15:45,915 --> 01:15:50,069
- You don't understand!
- And you have no feelings!

821
01:15:52,845 --> 01:15:54,166
Take it.

822
01:16:41,395 --> 01:16:45,507
Hey, man. Where were you?
That dog is finishing SultÃ¡n.

823
01:17:09,175 --> 01:17:11,425
- What are you doing up here?
- You got him killed, damn it!

824
01:17:11,475 --> 01:17:14,425
- It was all very fast!
- You shouldn't have put him up so often!

825
01:17:14,451 --> 01:17:16,545
Gonna teach me about dogs?

826
01:17:16,595 --> 01:17:18,915
Your dog gets killed
and you act like nothing.

827
01:17:19,805 --> 01:17:21,462
- Let go of me!
- Be calm.

828
01:17:21,566 --> 01:17:23,389
Let me teach you something
about dogs.

829
01:17:23,424 --> 01:17:24,900
I know dogs better than you do!

830
01:17:25,165 --> 01:17:28,065
You cannot be sentimental
about this, Chala!

831
01:17:28,395 --> 01:17:29,950
Son of a bitch!

832
01:17:30,808 --> 01:17:32,970
Chala, listen to me!

833
01:17:33,970 --> 01:17:35,724
I made SultÃ¡n fight weak dogs first,

834
01:17:35,756 --> 01:17:37,887
so that he would make a name
for himself.

835
01:17:37,985 --> 01:17:41,057
I knew everybody was going to bet
on the dog they already knew.

836
01:17:41,101 --> 01:17:44,447
But, what did I do?
I put our money on the best dog.

837
01:17:47,375 --> 01:17:48,698
Do you get it?

838
01:17:49,835 --> 01:17:51,032
Here...

839
01:18:18,838 --> 01:18:20,685
- Chala...
- I'm gonna look for pigeon food.

840
01:18:20,735 --> 01:18:23,105
- Chala, where is it?
- Where is what?

841
01:18:23,155 --> 01:18:26,227
- The bottle, son. Where is it?
- What bottle, mom?

842
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:30,123
The bottle that I keep here...

843
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:33,214
Let go of me!
You need to see a doctor!

844
01:18:33,289 --> 01:18:36,688
Who do you think you are
telling me what to do?!

845
01:18:36,888 --> 01:18:38,635
I have the right!

846
01:18:40,595 --> 01:18:42,543
I'm leaving. Move!

847
01:18:43,345 --> 01:18:46,992
All of this shit is mine, you hear me?
All of it! Fuck!

848
01:18:47,475 --> 01:18:51,087
- Where are you going?
- Mom! Where are you going?

849
01:18:56,275 --> 01:18:59,154
Anybody owes a book
from the last "Literary Cushion"?

850
01:18:59,258 --> 01:19:01,825
- No! - Well, who brought
something new for today?

851
01:19:02,025 --> 01:19:04,439
- "Lord of the Rings"
- We saw that already!

852
01:19:05,175 --> 01:19:08,245
- "The Little Prince"
- Let's see... Yeni.

853
01:19:08,665 --> 01:19:10,985
- I have one we haven't seen yet.
- Which one?

854
01:19:11,035 --> 01:19:13,948
- "White fang", by Jack London.
- Very well, Yeni.

855
01:19:14,955 --> 01:19:17,098
What's it about?

856
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:19,336
About the friendship
between a man and his dog.

857
01:19:20,175 --> 01:19:21,732
The man takes care of the dog

858
01:19:21,783 --> 01:19:24,005
after the dog is almost
killed in a fight.

859
01:19:24,215 --> 01:19:26,255
I see... And then?

860
01:19:26,564 --> 01:19:28,660
And then the dog helps the man.

861
01:19:28,765 --> 01:19:30,469
"White fang" is a great book.

862
01:19:32,207 --> 01:19:34,517
Who's going to be the lucky one
to borrow it?

863
01:19:34,572 --> 01:19:36,135
Me, Yeni!

864
01:19:47,405 --> 01:19:50,205
Have you chosen the passage
Chala must read to us?

865
01:19:51,503 --> 01:19:53,541
Yes teacher, it's marked.

866
01:19:55,515 --> 01:19:58,350
Listen, I'm gonna lock
this pigeon away...

867
01:19:58,817 --> 01:20:00,584
You're not cut out for this, man.

868
01:20:00,826 --> 01:20:03,366
- Who says?
- I'm gonna have to give you

869
01:20:03,417 --> 01:20:06,249
- ... some lessons about pigeons.
- I'm not listening to you.

870
01:20:07,392 --> 01:20:10,595
Hey, bro, is that book any good?

871
01:20:12,555 --> 01:20:15,583
Hey Chala! There's that cop downstairs.
Hurry!

872
01:20:19,875 --> 01:20:21,668
What did I do now?

873
01:20:29,655 --> 01:20:31,886
Only for a few minutes.

874
01:20:41,425 --> 01:20:44,044
They said you were almost dead.

875
01:20:55,275 --> 01:20:57,632
You're gonna leave me alone, mom.

876
01:22:33,625 --> 01:22:35,493
Can I stay here tonight?

877
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:26,681
Chala.

878
01:23:28,425 --> 01:23:29,860
Chala!

879
01:23:34,217 --> 01:23:36,261
Did you sleep well?

880
01:23:38,555 --> 01:23:40,755
We have to go to class.

881
01:23:41,275 --> 01:23:43,525
- I can't today.
- Why not?

882
01:23:45,608 --> 01:23:47,406
Mom is going into rehab.

883
01:23:48,282 --> 01:23:50,769
I've to get her some stuff
to the hospital.

884
01:23:55,535 --> 01:23:58,951
If you hurry up
I can help you with that.

885
01:24:03,415 --> 01:24:05,224
Breakfast is ready.

886
01:24:09,575 --> 01:24:11,067
Teach...

887
01:24:12,545 --> 01:24:16,479
When the year is over you're gonna go
and live with your grandson, right?

888
01:24:18,425 --> 01:24:22,525
I'm a worn-out old woman...
I don't want to be a burden for them.

889
01:24:22,630 --> 01:24:25,791
- But Orlandito said...
- I know...

890
01:24:27,025 --> 01:24:29,416
But I can tell you the truth.

891
01:24:38,726 --> 01:24:40,097
Richard!

892
01:24:41,875 --> 01:24:44,010
Don't worry, Carmela is getting here
any moment.

893
01:24:44,072 --> 01:24:46,866
- There's teacher Marta.
- Why aren't you inside?

894
01:24:46,923 --> 01:24:48,820
We're waiting for Carmela, teach.

895
01:24:50,505 --> 01:24:51,922
What's the matter?

896
01:24:55,595 --> 01:24:57,107
Yeni's father...

897
01:25:15,844 --> 01:25:18,101
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

898
01:25:18,273 --> 01:25:19,638
Chala, how is Sonia doing?

899
01:25:21,292 --> 01:25:23,463
She's better,
but she's going into rehab.

900
01:25:23,672 --> 01:25:25,698
She's going to be away
for a few weeks.

901
01:25:26,247 --> 01:25:30,557
Chala, didn't you have
to feed the pigeons before we left?

902
01:25:38,325 --> 01:25:43,925
Ignacio, the local police and the social
worker are very concerned about Chala.

903
01:25:44,975 --> 01:25:48,975
I was thinking, between you
and me, we could take care of him.

904
01:25:50,185 --> 01:25:52,885
You can't make decisions for me,
Carmela.

905
01:25:53,695 --> 01:25:56,445
That's why we're talking now.

906
01:25:57,056 --> 01:26:01,056
Don't insist.
I'm not falling for that.

907
01:26:01,475 --> 01:26:03,475
I don't want anything
to do with you either.

908
01:26:03,525 --> 01:26:04,343
There you go.

909
01:26:04,394 --> 01:26:06,425
And I already know
you aren't my father!

910
01:26:06,475 --> 01:26:08,278
Then you know more
than your mother does.

911
01:26:08,357 --> 01:26:10,589
Hey! That's enough!

912
01:26:14,675 --> 01:26:16,212
You have no right to do this!

913
01:26:16,254 --> 01:26:19,680
I was hoping you could be
the firm hand he needs.

914
01:26:20,095 --> 01:26:22,760
You know me! Do you think
I'm the right person for the job?

915
01:26:22,852 --> 01:26:24,825
Where is the right person?

916
01:26:27,375 --> 01:26:31,381
Take responsibility, Ignacio.
One day you'll thank me.

917
01:26:38,905 --> 01:26:42,119
And I'm cutting loose your dogs,
so you can shove your money!

918
01:26:49,181 --> 01:26:51,285
- Let go of me!
- Stop it!

919
01:26:51,326 --> 01:26:52,578
Chala, enough!

920
01:26:57,505 --> 01:26:59,205
Tell us how this is going to be.

921
01:27:00,635 --> 01:27:03,835
That's a problem you
have to solve yourselves.

922
01:27:07,345 --> 01:27:08,492
But Carmela!

923
01:27:09,555 --> 01:27:13,333
No "Carmela"! I want you tomorrow
at school first thing in the morning.

924
01:27:14,065 --> 01:27:17,565
And let's be clear:
no more dogs for Chala.

925
01:27:37,295 --> 01:27:38,730
There he is!

926
01:27:38,885 --> 01:27:40,364
Yeni!

927
01:27:46,125 --> 01:27:49,265
- How are you, sweetie?
- You took so long...

928
01:27:49,543 --> 01:27:51,805
I'm sorry, teacher,
but his case is complicated.

929
01:27:52,055 --> 01:27:54,255
He was in custody for a whole day.

930
01:27:55,475 --> 01:27:57,675
Because he has several warnings...

931
01:27:58,395 --> 01:28:03,294
Look... I had to vouch that
he would return to his province.

932
01:28:03,771 --> 01:28:04,571
But why?

933
01:28:05,084 --> 01:28:07,983
Didn't you explain
that this man is no delinquent,

934
01:28:08,034 --> 01:28:09,965
that he kills himself working...?

935
01:28:10,165 --> 01:28:14,655
I know all of that very well, teacher.
I'm from the provinces too, you know?

936
01:28:14,705 --> 01:28:16,793
But those are the rules.

937
01:28:19,675 --> 01:28:21,756
Thank you for everything, teacher.

938
01:28:23,425 --> 01:28:26,135
I still don't understand
why they held you in custody.

939
01:28:27,845 --> 01:28:30,560
Because they know
they can get something from me.

940
01:28:30,685 --> 01:28:33,427
But they caught me
penniless this time.

941
01:28:59,854 --> 01:29:03,675
It's important for the atmosphere
and for the ozone layer, teacher.

942
01:29:05,002 --> 01:29:08,327
- Because it is the habitat
of many animals. - What else?

943
01:29:08,515 --> 01:29:10,515
Yeni and MarÃ­a Paula!

944
01:29:11,125 --> 01:29:12,636
Please.

945
01:29:13,128 --> 01:29:15,878
Can the rest of us know
what you're talking about?

946
01:29:15,993 --> 01:29:17,977
Is it true that Carmela
is being retired?

947
01:29:19,315 --> 01:29:21,873
- Who told you that?
- Tell her.

948
01:29:23,505 --> 01:29:27,739
When I was in the rest room,
I overheard the cleaning ladies speaking

949
01:29:28,147 --> 01:29:30,066
of Carmela being retired.

950
01:29:30,262 --> 01:29:31,395
Why is that?

951
01:29:32,825 --> 01:29:34,851
Because of the card on the mural.

952
01:29:34,902 --> 01:29:37,648
And because she took you out
of re-education school.

953
01:30:00,958 --> 01:30:05,738
Carmela... Carmela!
Are you taking much longer?

954
01:30:06,275 --> 01:30:10,245
Leave, don't mind me.
I just can't mince my words.

955
01:30:10,295 --> 01:30:12,384
I want to write
everything I have to say.

956
01:30:13,325 --> 01:30:15,525
Why don't you use the computer?

957
01:30:18,495 --> 01:30:20,695
I like words to have sound.

958
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:24,075
You don't have to tell me that.

959
01:30:25,715 --> 01:30:28,398
What you didn't want
has just happened.

960
01:30:31,707 --> 01:30:33,469
The children know everything.

961
01:30:58,665 --> 01:31:00,945
- Come here.
- Me?

962
01:31:13,627 --> 01:31:15,119
So mysterious!

963
01:32:07,925 --> 01:32:10,425
Do you know what you
have just proven to me?

964
01:32:12,792 --> 01:32:14,638
That Carmela was right.

965
01:32:16,905 --> 01:32:19,155
You have no business being here.

966
01:32:19,205 --> 01:32:21,507
But she's going to be retired
because of me.

967
01:32:21,561 --> 01:32:23,482
This is how I see it:

968
01:32:24,375 --> 01:32:30,085
Now, it's your turn now to walk out
that door and make her look good.

969
01:32:31,005 --> 01:32:33,415
- That will satisfy her.
- But you don't understand...

970
01:32:33,465 --> 01:32:37,331
Chala, that's the only thing
that's up to you.

971
01:32:38,469 --> 01:32:40,628
The rest is yet to be seen.

972
01:32:56,485 --> 01:33:01,697
Let's see, do you remember
why you put the card on the mural?

973
01:33:03,825 --> 01:33:06,199
Did anybody see
anything wrong with that?

974
01:33:07,533 --> 01:33:08,745
No.

975
01:33:08,795 --> 01:33:10,071
What happened then?

976
01:33:10,621 --> 01:33:13,468
It's because of what MarÃ­a Paula
overheard in the rest room.

977
01:33:14,441 --> 01:33:16,981
And that's why you turned yourself in.

978
01:33:17,305 --> 01:33:20,067
- Do you believe in the Virgin?
- I did my catechism

979
01:33:20,107 --> 01:33:23,135
and my first Holy Communion
in the same church you go to now.

980
01:33:23,192 --> 01:33:25,352
But I haven't seen you at mass.

981
01:33:26,015 --> 01:33:28,783
I can stand priests telling
me there's something wrong

982
01:33:28,833 --> 01:33:30,710
with my grandmother's
African saints.

983
01:33:30,895 --> 01:33:34,514
Teach, you still haven't
told us if you're really retiring.

984
01:33:34,775 --> 01:33:37,985
They're worried about my health.
They want to take care of me.

985
01:33:38,035 --> 01:33:41,859
- Is that it?
- What's the big deal?

986
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:45,523
I was out for 3 months
and nothing stopped around here.

987
01:33:45,849 --> 01:33:48,995
No, but there's only one Carmela,
and everybody knows that.

988
01:33:49,045 --> 01:33:52,755
Richard, I'm tired of telling
you not to be such a suck up!

989
01:33:52,875 --> 01:33:56,875
Teacher, is there something wrong
with the card being on the mural?

990
01:33:59,135 --> 01:34:01,164
There's a reason for everything, Yeni.

991
01:34:01,349 --> 01:34:04,495
I promise some other time
we'll talk of it.

992
01:34:05,975 --> 01:34:07,911
But now, what matters the most

993
01:34:07,962 --> 01:34:11,525
is that you feel everything
is the way it ought to be.

994
01:34:11,575 --> 01:34:16,355
None of us is fool, teach.
We know we're getting you into trouble.

995
01:34:16,405 --> 01:34:18,605
Is that the problem?

996
01:34:20,892 --> 01:34:22,489
Give me the card.

997
01:34:40,425 --> 01:34:42,625
And now, let's go over homework.

998
01:34:56,655 --> 01:34:58,989
Give your mother a hug, c'mon.

999
01:35:07,175 --> 01:35:10,675
I'm trying, my boy, but it's so hard!

1000
01:35:14,836 --> 01:35:17,447
I'm taking this shit out of the house.

1001
01:35:23,175 --> 01:35:25,641
I'm gonna lay myself down for a bit.

1002
01:35:45,619 --> 01:35:48,486
You have to go back
to the clinic tomorrow, mom.

1003
01:35:52,175 --> 01:35:55,175
Don't tell your mother
what she has to do.

1004
01:36:41,372 --> 01:36:42,788
What's going on?

1005
01:36:43,775 --> 01:36:45,755
I'm taking them away, remember?

1006
01:36:45,805 --> 01:36:48,165
To get them killed in another fight?

1007
01:36:54,395 --> 01:36:58,787
Chala, I give you what I've got.
That's all I can do.

1008
01:36:59,235 --> 01:37:01,345
- You could make me a bookmaker.
- What?

1009
01:37:01,395 --> 01:37:04,427
I'm good at math and no one
is going to mistrust a kid.

1010
01:37:05,195 --> 01:37:09,212
- Are you off your head?
- I gotta help mom.

1011
01:37:18,295 --> 01:37:21,174
Listen carefully
what I'm about to say...

1012
01:37:22,225 --> 01:37:25,057
If you ever do so much
as mention that to me again,

1013
01:37:26,005 --> 01:37:28,010
we're going straight to Carmela.

1014
01:37:29,345 --> 01:37:32,313
And I'm sending you back
to re-education school myself.

1015
01:37:33,095 --> 01:37:34,481
Okay?

1016
01:37:41,735 --> 01:37:45,698
Ignacio... leave the dogs then.

1017
01:37:49,925 --> 01:37:52,590
You can keep Oso,
he's too old anyway.

1018
01:37:52,855 --> 01:37:55,514
I told you I gotta help mom.

1019
01:38:00,275 --> 01:38:02,245
We'll come up with something.

1020
01:38:02,295 --> 01:38:05,795
Something that has nothing
to do with dogs nor bets.

1021
01:38:08,965 --> 01:38:10,493
Tell me the truth...

1022
01:38:11,875 --> 01:38:14,375
Are you my father or not?

1023
01:38:21,605 --> 01:38:23,703
I swear to you I don't know.

1024
01:38:54,975 --> 01:38:56,975
I think it won't take too long.

1025
01:39:10,405 --> 01:39:13,334
I'm sorry to be late to my own funeral,

1026
01:39:14,785 --> 01:39:17,397
but I'm only punctual for class.

1027
01:39:18,825 --> 01:39:21,945
Well, all presents agree that
Carmela is one of those teachers

1028
01:39:21,995 --> 01:39:23,916
you can't let go in silence, right?

1029
01:39:24,487 --> 01:39:27,455
That's why we have invited
some of her former students...

1030
01:39:27,505 --> 01:39:29,019
Excuse me, Raquel.

1031
01:39:30,275 --> 01:39:33,946
You don't know how much
I appreciate all of this.

1032
01:39:34,531 --> 01:39:36,494
But I've written something.

1033
01:39:37,241 --> 01:39:41,538
So, if you don't mind,
I'll rather do this my way.

1034
01:39:57,182 --> 01:39:58,643
It's roughly written.

1035
01:39:59,745 --> 01:40:03,615
I don't know if I should have thought
some things better.

1036
01:40:03,665 --> 01:40:05,711
But this is how I feel.

1037
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:51,105
- I didn't see you at class today.
- I'm not going anymore.

1038
01:40:54,045 --> 01:40:56,668
- We have to go.
- Why is that?

1039
01:40:58,143 --> 01:40:59,491
Yeni.

1040
01:41:13,475 --> 01:41:15,336
I know I crossed a line...

1041
01:41:16,269 --> 01:41:20,565
But being on this side was the only way
to stay at peace with my conscience.

1042
01:41:21,655 --> 01:41:25,023
If you decide so, Carmela goes...

1043
01:41:26,205 --> 01:41:27,823
but Marta stays.

1044
01:41:29,955 --> 01:41:32,542
I only wanted to teach you
one very simple thing,

1045
01:41:32,653 --> 01:41:34,746
that you have learned very well.

1046
01:41:35,635 --> 01:41:39,811
Now, time will make you
a better teacher than this old woman,

1047
01:41:43,664 --> 01:41:48,622
who is only retiring the day
she can't climb those stairs.

1048
01:41:54,225 --> 01:41:56,129
You'll have to fire me.

1049
01:41:58,113 --> 01:42:00,975
And I want this attached
to my dismissal papers.

1050
01:42:10,275 --> 01:42:12,198
Attach this too.

1051
01:42:12,665 --> 01:42:15,566
This is my opinion on Chala's case.

1052
01:42:19,335 --> 01:42:23,907
Fine. Let's say we could cover up
for the girl from HolguÃ­n.

1053
01:42:23,978 --> 01:42:25,438
There's no need for that now.

1054
01:42:25,975 --> 01:42:29,004
Yeni and her father
must return to their province.

1055
01:42:31,375 --> 01:42:32,831
I'm sorry.

1056
01:42:33,192 --> 01:42:35,668
Especially because I know
the kind of student she is.

1057
01:42:37,064 --> 01:42:40,253
I was even willing to do
what I shouldn't for her.

1058
01:42:47,624 --> 01:42:50,181
What should we do about the card then?

1059
01:42:54,975 --> 01:42:57,373
You didn't understand a thing.

1060
01:42:57,875 --> 01:42:59,435
Did you?

1061
01:44:28,745 --> 01:44:30,613
Carmela!

1062
01:44:41,815 --> 01:44:43,935
Here, teacher, give me your bag.

1063
01:44:43,985 --> 01:44:46,985
- Good afternoon!
- Good afternoon.

1064
01:44:51,205 --> 01:44:55,875
BEHAVIOR
