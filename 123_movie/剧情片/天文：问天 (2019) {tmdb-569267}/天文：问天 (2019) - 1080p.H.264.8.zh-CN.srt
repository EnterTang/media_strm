1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,050
 
For most of human history, the only light we knew came from the sky

2
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,280
 
By day, the Sun
 By night, an uncountable number of stars

3
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:23,870
From the beginning, our ancestors believe that Sun and stars were heavenly out of this world
  
And there were right

4
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:33,740
We have been watching the sky for thousands of years
 
But until recently, we couldn
t see well enough to understand our connection to the cosmos

5
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:38,300
But now, our astronomical vision has sharpened 

6
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:44,020
 
We can see farther and clearer
 
We can observe object that are invisible to human eyes

7
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:48,860
Our increasingly improving vision has allowed us to make great discoveries

8
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,330
revealing an astonishing and wonderful universe

9
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:58,410
What follows are 13 of the greatest discoveries in astronomy

10
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,890

11
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,920

12
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,410
:
CHD

13
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,540
 
14
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:38,410
The Planets Move

15
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,370
Our first great discovery happened over centuries

16
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:47,260
As the first human looked carefully into sky in places like this

17
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:56,360
 
 
The empty cloudless deserts of the American southwest, the Middle East, Africa, and South America

18
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,430
Of these ancient astronomers, the most important were the Mesopotamians

19
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,310
They consider the objects in the sky gods

20
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:15,860
And build giant tower so they can record the rising and setting of the Sun, the moon, and the stars

21
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,380
For more than a thousand years, they use clay tablet to record what they saw

22
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:29,660
 
To find out more, I paid a visit to  professor of astronomy Owen Gingerich

23
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,360
 
Here for example, is one of these clay tablets
 And have a read

24
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,880
,
Oh
 Yes
 These guys, there people wrote small

25
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:48,130
-
,
,
Yes
 
Yes, I was perfectly amazed if somebody came into my office and picked it up and actually started reading it
-So what language is this

26
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,360
En
 I think this is in Babylonian

27
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,090
Hundreds of these tablets were unburied

28
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:01,110
 
Among these hundreds of tablets is a tablet called the Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa

29
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,120
And this tablet contains the motion of the planet Venus

30
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:13,030
That
s the earliest record we have of a planet moving

31
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:19,730
 
After the Mesopotamians made the fist records, it was the Greeks who took the next step
 

32
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:28,640
 
Some of the Greek astronomers made a field trip out to Mesopotamia to find out what had been going on there

33
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,060
And they seemed to brought 
bring
 back some systematical records

34
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:38,780
 
So, it ultimately gave the basis for making a mathematical theory of the motion of the planets

35
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:46,750
--
From their observations, the Greeks developed the vision of the solar system that would stand for some 2000 years

36
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,410
that the planets move revolving around the earth

37
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,930
It will take our next great discovery to set the record straight

38
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,420
The Earth Moves

39
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:09,170
1543
The year is 1543

40
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:14,930

A seventy-year-old man is dying
-
 His name
 Nicolaus Copernicus

41
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:22,470
A doctor and a lawyer by trade,

40
but nearly for nearly 40 years he was also an amateur astronomer

42
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:29,210
A pursue that had let him to challenge one of the most fundamental and sacred believes of his time

43
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:40,460
As a young man, Copernicus had studied the heavens 
and found that the Greek
s earth center system failed when it came to predicting planetary motion

44
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,500
He began to wonder if the earth itself moved,but

45
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,710
Here is Copernicus
s idea

46
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,440
-
   
With the Sun at the center
-
With the Sun at the center

47
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:03,210
And now suddenly, all the planet are going always the same way around
 
they are not stop

48
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:09,170
Copernicus realized that the movements of the planet were better explained if the Sun were the center of the solar system

49
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,920
And the earth circled it like an ordinary planet

50
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,560
It was a revolutionary insight

51
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:25,530
 
Despite any evidence that the earth was moving,
,
he came up with this book, which gives his new theory

52
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:30,260
 
This idea, this, this book changed the world

53
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:45,670
,
,
Yes, because it made the earth a planet and it fixed the Sun in the center
 
If you don
t have that blueprint you don
t march ahead to the physics, the physics of the cosmos

54
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:51,000
 
As it happened, the final pages,

55
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,260
which were just these here in the front of the book came to him on the very day he died

56
00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:05,810
,
I suspect, I mean, he was lying there partially paralyzed from a stroke
he was probably just hanging in there until he could make it sure that it was done

57
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:11,680
Planetary Orbits are Elliptical

58
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:22,610
Everyone from the Greeks to Copernicus assumed the orbits of the planet had to be circular

59
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:31,990
1571
 
But in 1571, German mathematician Johannes Kepler 
shattered that assumption with our next great discovery

60
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:41,280
,
Lacking calculus, Kepler improvised ways to compute circular orbit of mars

61
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,790
The work was tedious

62
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:51,460
,
Kepler wrote that he was almost driven to madness considering in calculating the matter

63
00:06:53,930 --> 00:07:01,080
His calculations began to reveal that the accepted notion of planet moving in circles simply did not work

64
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,760
Then a new idea came to him

65
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:14,150
Kepler realized somehow the Sun had to be driving the planet in some way he didn
t fully understand

66
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:22,920
And to get a self-consistent picture, he found that an ellipse was the path rather than a circle

67
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:31,720
 
With this breakthrough, Kepler devised the first method
for accurately predicting the movement of the planet and  stars across the sky

68
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:39,350
When his tables predicted the planet Mercury to pass across the front of the Sun 

69
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,160
And nobody else
s tables were close

70
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:48,310
That was dramatical proof of the accuracy of his astronomy

71
00:07:49,130 --> 00:08:05,340
They linked the motions of the planets solidly to the Sun
 
This was a very important point to helps stress the idea that the Copernicus
s Sun-centered system really had physical significance
72
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:18,050
 
Despite the success of Kepler
s theory, many remain skeptical that the Sun could be the center of the Solar System
73
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:26,960
But the final nail in that coffin was about to be driven home by a man who like Kepler
prefer to use observational evidences to form his theories
74
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,410
-
And that man was Galileo Galilei
75
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:37,740
Jupiter has Moons
76
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:47,610
,
Meet Galileo Galilei, a man determined to pursue truth no matter where it led
77
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:55,700
 
In the case of our next great discovery, 
his determination led him to revolutionize our knowledge of the solar system
78
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:05,300
1609
,
 
The year is 1609 and Galileo was fascinated with the new invention called a telescope
79
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:13,160
 
Essentially, that was a toy out of a carnival
When Galileo heard about it, he went to work, making one
80
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:19,550
 
He ferfected it and essentially converted the toy into a scientific instrument 
81
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,600
Galileo turned his telescope skyward
82
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,750
and was the first to see the mountains on the moon
83
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,500
And the star clusters of the Milky Way
84
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:38,750
Then an extraordinary sight
85
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,680
4
A group of 4 small bright stars arranged around the planet Jupiter
86
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:52,810
We have the manuscript of his first week of observations
 
87
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:59,480
And it was wonderful 
because you see him gradually coming to the conclusion
88
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,820
That these little stars are carried along with Jupiter
89
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,690
This was the moment of discovery
90
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:14,770
Galileo realized that the stars were actually four moons orbiting Jupiter
91
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:22,370
He had the insight that these moving dots were orbiting a planet
92
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:28,690
And I sometime say he invented the satellite
 
,
And you say, wait a minute, they were there, how could he even invent them
93
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,680
He invented the idea that they were going around the planet
94
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,890
Here was proof that Copernicus was right about the structure of solar system
95
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:47,190
 
If moons could orbit Jupiter, and the earth could orbit the Sun  
96
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:54,730
And Galileo
s discovery demonstrated that
knowledge in astronomy can only be advanced by actual observation
97
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:58,280
A theory can only be viable when it supported by the facts
98
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,290
Just like our next great discovery
99
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:10,000
Halley
s Comet
100
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,740
For centuries, comets had been considered harbingers of evil
101
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,720
By the end of the middle ages, comet
s appearance invoked fear and terror
102
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:33,930
,
,
But the renaissance scientist Edmond Halley, like Galileo was interested in facts, not superstition
103
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:42,370
1695
In 1695, he began searching for records of ancient and recent comet sightings 
104
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:51,380
24
He found 24 comets whose passages across the sky have been recorded with enough detail to allow him to roughly plot their orbits
105
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,590
,
3
To his surprise, he found that three of the comets seem to follow the same approximate orbit
106
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,650
76
Circling the Sun every 76 years
107
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:08,360
76
On that basis, he figured, ok, this is a comet that is going to be back in another 76 years
108
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,260
-
3
He figured out the three comets were actually the same comet
 
-
The same comet
109
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:18,130
Halley was so certain of the comet orbit that he made a bold prediction
110
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:24,800
1758
He said the comet would return in year 1758
111
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,120
-
And guess what
-
It was
 The comet came back
112
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:35,610
Unfortunately, Halley was no longer live to see his discovery
113
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:44,350
3
Since then, Halley 
s Comet, as is known, has been greeted 3 more times by excited sky watchers across the globe
114
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:55,440
,
No longer a harbinger of evil, Halley 
s Comet became a milestone discovery in history of astronomy
115
00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:01,620
,
replacing a superstition belief with the rational scientific understanding of the physical universe
 
116
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:10,580
Milky Way a Disk of Stars
117
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:18,900
18
In the eighteenth century, William Herschel was a classically trained musician
118
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,640
whose love of astronomy let him to give up music and turn his attention to the heavens
119
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,140
This is setting stage for our next great discovery
120
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:39,080
When he discovered the price of refracting telescope,which was beyond his meet
 
He decided to make his own
121
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:46,080
And he became the most fabulous and successful telescope builder of that period
122
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:53,910
He used his telescope to methodically  survey the sky, cataloging what he saw
 
123
00:13:55,630 --> 00:14:03,320
 
As he was searching the sky, he came across an object that looked a little bit different,
turned out to be a new planet
124
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,500
--
Oh, wow, and what planet was that
125
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,220
,
That was the next planet beyond Saturn
 The planet Uranus
126
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,360
3500
,
Uranus was the first new planet to be identified in more than 3500 years
127
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:24,750
But finding a new planet was nothing compared to Herschel
s larger goal
 
128
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,160
20
But finding a new planet was nothing compared to Herschel
s larger goal
 
129
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:35,930
,
And then divided the sky into equal sections, and began to systematically count the stars in each field
130
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:40,510
It was a painstaking, monumental task
131
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:45,980
Slowly, Herschel
s star count began to reveal something extraordinary
132
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,850
The Milky Way was much larger than anyone knew
133
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,660
It was a gigantic disk of stars
134
00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:00,740
  
25
Some of its field were jam-packed
 One showed more than a quarter of a million stars alone
135
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,250
Other fields, farther away, were practically empty
136
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:11,960
Herschel
s discovery was a revelation
137
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:17,480
This is a reasonable model of the Milky Way as we know it now
 
138
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:31,520
--
But Herschel was only work at an area about this big, is that right
 
--
What Herschel was seeing, was a small range like this, maybe that big
139
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,700
So was really a small part of the entire milky way
140
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:41,500
But even that small part significantly changed the study of astronomy
141
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:48,910
Herschel
s discovery revealed that our solar system was just an island in a deep and expansive universe
142
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,370
General Relativity
143
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:10,210
 
Thanks to the musing of an obscure clerk worked in the Swiss patent office
 
Our next great discovery revealed that the universe is a strange, mysterious place
144
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,990
-
That clerk was Albert Einstein
145
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:22,700
20
 
In the early 19 hundreds, he was puzzled, along with the rest scientific community
146
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,680
by the orbit of the planet Mercury
147
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:39,730
Despite the ability of Newton
s laws of gravity to precisely predict the motion of the planets
The laws failed when it came to correctly predicting Mercury
s orbit
148
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:45,110
The puzzle had to do with Mercury
s perihelion
149
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,590
that point of its orbit which is closest to the Sun
150
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,760
Every century Mercury
s perihelion advance slightly
151
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:58,890
A change that Newton
s equations could not account for
152
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:09,980
 
In the bold and startling move, young Einstein proposed his own theory to explain
the puzzle of Mercury
s orbit
153
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:15,020
and in the process developed a theory that refined the Newton
s law of gravity
154
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:22,470
Michio Kaku is the theoretical physicist at the City University of New York
155
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:29,220
And Newton says that gravity travels instantaneously through around space
156
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,100
And that
s what Einstein thought there was a weakness in Newton
s theory
157
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:41,110
 
 
He wanted the theory that could explain gravity
 he wanted the theory that could explain acceleration, zigzag and circular motion
158
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:46,470
 
 
There has to be waves, gravity waves
 It takes time for gravity to work its magic
159
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,250
--
 
To propagate
--
To propagate
160
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:56,230
 
8
  
So if the Sun disappears, it will take 8 minutes for us to know about that fact
even gravity travels at this speed of light
161
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:06,980
  
Einstein needed a new picture to explain that and that picture was curved space 
 
that space itself has curved
 And that
s why objects move
162
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:14,950
Einstein believed that his concept of curved space was responsible for shifting mercury
s orbit
163
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,250
Einstein called his idea the theory of general relativity
164
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:27,880
 
Imagine a trampling net and place a bowling ball in the middle of the trampling net
165
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:31,140
The bowling sinks into the trampling net
166
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:38,370
And now shoot a marble, a marble around the trampling net
The marble will orbit, orbit around the bowling ball
167
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:49,640
 
Now, from a distance looking down, Newton would say that there is a force and instantaneous invisible force puling, 
pulling the marble down to the bowling ball
168
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:56,620
But Einstein would say that
s no force, there
s no pull
It
s just a trampling net
169
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:03,660
And why is the marble orbiting the around the bowling ball
Because the trampling net is pushing the marble
 
170
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:12,650
,
 
Therefore why I am sitting on this chair
 
 
Not because gravity pulls you to the ground
 It
s because space pushes me down toward the planet Earth
171
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:19,300
The idea that space itself is worked by mass was too strange for many to accept
172
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:26,780
An approaching solar eclipse gave scientists the perfect opportunity to put Einstein
s new theory to the test
173
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:35,630
Photographs were taken of the background stars before the eclipse and then afterward
174
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:40,430
These pictures were then compared with the photos taken during the eclipse
175
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:51,150
The photo show that the positions of the stars in the eclipse photo shifted slightly inward
,
bending is the lights from the stars passed the Sun
s gravitational field
176
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:55,930
Einstein
s theory of general relativity was right
177
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:00,100
His great discovery rocked the world
178
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,710
General relativity strikes deep emotional core and anyone who
s ever looked these equations
179
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:16,050
  
 
These equations are one inch long 
and they answer these eternal question that dogged us
180
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:19,300
:
ever since we first look into the sky and ask ourselves the question what it all means
181
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,930
The Universe is expanding
182
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:35,870
 
General relativity had showed that the space was weirder than anyone could imagine
,
anyone but Einstein that is
183
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:43,120
 
To gain a clearer understanding of the strange universe, astronomers needed more observational data
184
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:47,500
And that required larger more powerful telescopes
185
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,280
Like the one that led to our next great discovery
186
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,180
1830
When the Herschels had finished his survey of heavens in the 1830s
187
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:06,470
 
They cataloged thousands of these beautiful but hazy objects then called white nebulae
188
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,840
At the time, no one knew whether they were part of our galaxy 
189
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:19,070
or distant island universe like the Milky Way
190
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:36,820
1924
 
 
In 1924, astronomer Edwin Hubble was studying the stars in several white nebulae
100
using 100-inch reflected telescope at the Mount Wilson Observatory in California
191
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:50,820
The telescope enabled Hubble to estimate that the galaxy were routinely many hundreds of thousands, even millions of light years away
192
00:21:51,480 --> 00:22:02,180
 
Here were objects as huge and populated with stars as our very own Milky Way galaxy, which is why we today call white nebulae galaxies
193
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:09,390
The more Hubble studied these galaxies, the more he became intrigued
194
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:16,220
At the time, scientists knew that the beam of light from the star appears as different color on a spectrum
195
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,490
The color changed according to the motion of the star
196
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:26,120
A shift toward blue on the spectrum meant the star was moving closer to the earth
197
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,100
A red shift meant it was moving away
198
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,480
The amount of the color shift also revealed the speed of that movement
199
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:42,810
  
 
Hubble found when he measured the distance of the galaxy, its spectrum almost always was shifting to the red
200
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:49,420
And something else, the farther the distance, the greater the red shift
201
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,450
In other words, the universe was expanding
202
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:59,850
It was an astonishing discovery with profound implications
203
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:09,820
 
Measuring backwards from the expansion, scientists found that the universe appeared to have a cataclysmic beginning
where one of the astronomers labeled the big bang
204
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:31,850
Milky Way Emits Radio Waves
205
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:38,990
3
Just three years after Hubble discovered the expanding universe,
206
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:45,410
our next great discovery revealed a mysterious object hidden behind the dust at the center of the Milky Way
207
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:51,350
 
And gave birth to a whole new branch of astronomy, using wave length invisible to the human eye
208
00:23:54,950 --> 00:24:02,270
1930
25
-
In 1930, Karl Jansky was a 25-year-old physicist
 working for the bell laboratories in Holmdel, New Jersey
209
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:14,910
15
Jansky
s job was to identify the kinds of interference occurring at the 15 meter wave length
then used for ship-to-shore and transatlantic communication 
210
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:23,540
 
3
After spending more than a year recording data, Jansky decided there were three forms of static at this frequency
211
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,910
The first was clearly produced in the earth
s ionosphere
212
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,680
The second was caused by local thunderstorms
213
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:38,200
And the third signal was mysterious, continuous
214
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:43,040
It was coming from what appeared first to be, the Sun
215
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,810
Each morning, this signal slowly rose with the Sun
216
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:51,640
During the day, it rotated across the sky
217
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,830
And then it set when the Sun did
218
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:02,680
But as time passed, Jansky found that the mysterious radio signals slowly drifted away from the Sun
219
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:06,460
as if it were coming from a point outside the solar system
220
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:15,260
Eventually, Jansky pinpointed this location somewhere in the region of the constellation Sagittarius
221
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:19,430
He believed he had discovered unknown interstellar object at the center of the galaxy
222
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,570
And he was right
223
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:30,460
Later astronomers confirmed that Jansky had discovered a super massive black hole
224
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:33,550
300
Equal a mass to three million Suns
225
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:41,630
 
Perhaps even more significant, he was the first human to look at the universe using radio astronomy
226
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,340
A whole new way to study the sky
227
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:48,510
It was a landmark discovery
228
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:54,640
Jansky has proved that the sky does not merely sparkle with the gentle glow of the star light
229
00:25:54,760 --> 00:26:03,020
 
Hidden out there are many strange objects, many light years away
 
that actually radiate more energy than whole galaxies
230
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:11,780
Like quasars and pulsars, dead stars spinning madly with masses
 
that are so dense that single teaspoon would weigh millions of tons
231
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,890
Before astronomers could even begin understand the life and death of stars
232
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:26,420
 
New telescope would have to be built that we can look at the sky in many different wave lenghs
233
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:37,400
 
Before that could happened though, radio astronomy produced another great discovery, 
 
that, although predicted, was as unexpected by discoverer as Jansky
s has been
234
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,680
And once again, it happened in bell lab that Holmdel in new jersey
235
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,330
Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation
236
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:56,970
1964
200
In 1964, bell labs had the spare 200-foot-microwave antenna sitting dormant
237
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:03,200
Rather than destroyed it, the lab decided to let the astronomers use it for research
238
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:17,080
2
 31
28
Two physicists, 31-year-old Arno Penzias and 28-year-old Robert Wilson
decided to use the antenna for measuring the temperature of the gas halo surrounding the Milky Way galaxy
239
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:23,620
What happened next is one of the most exciting discoveries in modern astronomy
240
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,990
-
  
Hello bill
-
Doc
 Wilson
241
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,110
And I came to bell labs to get the story first-hand from Robber Wilson himself
242
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:40,300
Two of us, Arno Penzias and I, had just come to bell lab from graduate school
243
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:44,040
And we were going to measure radiation from the Milky Way
244
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:50,370
 
And that
s was this antenna really fit in because we could reject the radiation from the earth
245
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:55,390
And what was left is what
s coming from the sky
246
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:00,620
2
There are only getting about two degrees from the earth
s atmosphere
247
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:04,410
1
Maybe picked up one degree from the walls of this thing
248
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:09,320
  
2
But , when we first turned it on, it was about twice
7
that about seven degrees
249
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:16,590
And this wasn
t right
 Something from the earth must be on our instrumentation
250
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:29,670
 
 
We have crossed around a hill here and overlooked New York City
 We had the ideal instrument for checking on that though
 
 
 
We merely turned down horizon, scanned the horizon and, but pore nothing particular extra
251
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:38,200
1
  
There was a pair of pigeon that lived here, and of course it was covered with like pigeon droppings
252
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:42,770
So, we thought well, maybe the pigeon droppings are doing more than we think
253
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:47,520
Arno and I got up in here and we cleaned all the pigeon droppings out
254
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:52,080
-
You got to get rid of pigeons
-
What had you do with pigeons
255
00:28:52,290 --> 00:29:01,510
Fist, we put them in the company mail and sent them as far as we could which was Whippany, New Jersey, to a pigeon fans there
 
who said these are junk pigeons and let them go
256
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:05,630
-
  
A couple of days they were back
 
-40
 
40 miles away and they came back
257
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:09,370
So then our technician brought out a shot gun
258
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,820
And how did that work
259
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,260
 
I wasn
t here and I didn
t see
 But basically it didn
t solve our problem
260
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:21,810
3
4
We still have an extra three or four degrees
261
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:27,910
 
 
We were really being into perplexed
 Because we believed in physics, 
it
s coming from somewhere
 
262
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:32,440
 
We can calculate what the horn was doing except for this ex-noise
263
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:42,640
 
At the time that Penzias and Wilson detected the radio static
2
 there are two competing theories about the origin of the universe
 
264
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:47,690
 
There was the big bang theory which Hubble
s expanding universe supported
 
265
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:56,120
 
And there was the steady state theory, which propose that universe is timeless with no beginning or end, 
  
expanding forever
266
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:03,680
When a friend heard what Penzias and Wilson had found
267
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:10,240
 
 he suggested they get in touch with some cosmologists at Princeton University who advocates the big bang theory
268
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:21,420
They believed that the big bang would have left a faint thermal afterglow explode in the universe,
 
traces of heat from the roaring of the bang itself, detectable across the entire sky
269
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:27,230
And they were about to conduct research in hopes of measuring that afterglow
270
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:37,600
 
We invited them over
 They came over and looked what we had done 
and immediately agreed that we had measured what they were setting out to do
271
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,930
So what is your discovery mean
272
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:43,210
It means that we live in a big bang universe
273
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:48,740
30
And we are seeing the radiation from three hundred thousand years after the big bang
274
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:55,250
 
Many cases when there is a paradigm shift of science, it takes a generation before people really accept it
275
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,510
 
But in this case, I think the world is ready for it
276
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:02,960
Human societies have always worried about where they came from
277
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:09,900
 
There are religious stories in every civilization that has ever been found
And I think we have the definitive answer 
278
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,150
that we came out of big bang
279
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,670
Gamma Ray Bursts
280
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:28,700
 
 
The coming of the space age ushered in a golden age of astronomy that is still going on today
281
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:36,040
 
That golden age began strangely enough, not in space, 
but was the turning point in cold war relations
282
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,890
That also contributed to our next great discovery
283
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:51,990
20
60
,
,
In the nineteen sixties, despite a nuclear-test-ban-treaty
The Soviet Union refused to allowed onside inspectors enter his nuclear facilities
284
00:31:53,640 --> 00:32:03,940
 
 
As a result, the US opted to monitor the soviets by developing an orbital satellite system
capable of detecting gamma rays burst produced by nuclear explosions
285
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:10,860
Because the satellites detector looked up as well as down
 
286
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:16,510
Scientists decided to use them to see  
if supernovae produced gamma rays when they exploded
287
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:31,240
1969-1972
 
16
Between 1969 and 1972, they detected evidence of 16 short gamma ray bursts, scattering across the sky
There was just one problem
288
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,650
None of the burst correlated with any of the known supernova events
289
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,740
And the mystery deepened
290
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:45,320
20
,
1
Over the next two decades, astronomers detected an average of one gamma ray burst a day
291
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:51,480
 
But each burst happened so quickly that was over before astronomers could get a telescope aimed at it
292
00:32:55,050 --> 00:33:00,770
BeoopSAX
Finally, astronomers began to solve the puzzle with the help of the BEOOP SAX space telescope, which was designed specifically
293
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:07,320
X
to detect the short burst of gamma and x-rays and precisely pinpoint their locations
 
294
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:20,540
1997
12
14
 
On December fourteenth 1997, BEOOP SAS located a gamma ray burst,
leading to the first photographs ever taken a burst and wave lengths other than gamma
295
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:29,510
 
120
To their astonishment, astronomers discovered that burst took place in a galaxy twelve billion light years away
296
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:33,290
Making one of the universe most powerful explosions
297
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:42,040
 
Since then, dozens of other gamma rays bursts have been similarly documented
 All just as powerful and far away
298
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:53,510
As for what it all means
 
 
the discovery of gamma rays burst have once again show us that hidden now there behind the veil of the earth
s atmosphere are objects
299
00:33:53,710 --> 00:34:02,520
 
 
 
that are not only strange and hard-defined, black holes, pulsars, quasars
 
But there are lethal too
300
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:09,200
Gamma ray bursts are now considered the possible cause of past distinction events on earth
301
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:15,770
The scientist sir Arthur Eddington once noted that 
302
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:20,890
 
Not only is the universe stranger than we imagine
 It is stranger than we can
t imagine
303
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:27,920
  
He could be talking about the gamma ray burst, the expanding universe or the theory of general relativity
304
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:32,430
And it also happened to be a perfect description of our next discovery
305
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:38,750
Planets Orbiting Other Stars
306
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:47,150
Once it would been been impossible for astronomers to imagine discovering other solar systems with planets like our own
307
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:58,250
But today, astronomers can imagine 
 
thanks to powerful space and ground-based telescopes like the one here in the Lick Observatory in the Mount Hamilton California
308
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,290
where Geoff Marcy is hunting for new planets
309
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,250
How do you go out finding a planet around a star
310
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:11,340
 
Wow, it
s very easy
 We watch the star to see if it wobbles in response to the planet, yanking around gravitationally
311
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,790
-
 
Very easy
-
Very easy
312
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:19,700
-
you just need one of these
-
 
3
that
s right
 This is the 3-meter lick observatory telescope  
313
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:31,850
  
By definition, planets don
t produce their own energy, they shine of course by the reflected light
 
But planet are about a billionth as bright as their host star
314
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,850
  
So you can
t really see them even with the Hubble
 
you need a trick and that is what we use with this telescope
315
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:46,790
-
  
A trick
-
  
 
The Doppler
s effect are trick
 We measure the wobble of the star by the changing light waves that come from the star as the star wobbles
316
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:53,330
90
The search for extra-solar planetary system gain momentary in the early nineteen nineties
317
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:56,720
When a polish astronomer made a surprising discovery
318
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:09,400
3
 
There was a wonderful discovery by Alexander Wolszczan of a system of three planets orbiting a pulsar 
  
and the way he found them was quiet exciting
 He watched the pulses coming from the pulsar
319
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:14,960
And their arriveal of those pulses changes as the pulsars approaches and recedes us
320
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:25,030
  
 X
These are hideous stars
 Pulsars have ultraviolet x-rays gamma rays coming often
 
They are the bizarre end products of a supernova explosion
321
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:29,350
  
And despite that bizarre environment, here we have earth-size planets going around it
322
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:34,710
If there are earth-size planet go around pulsars
you can bet there are earth-size planets that around other stars
323
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,830
There are earth-size planets around pulsars
324
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:40,190
3
Earth-size and even moon-sized among the three
325
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:43,740
-
3
  
He detected them
-
Detected them by this wobble of the pulsars
326
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,660
--
   
That
s just the coolest thing in the world
--
 It
s unbelievable
327
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:53,490
 
Since wolszczan
s discovery
130
Marcy and other astronomers have found more than one hundred thirty extra-solar planets
328
00:36:53,820 --> 00:37:02,470
We thought we would have never found even one planet 
3
4
and we found the world
s only triple planet system and the quadruple planet system with this telescope
329
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:10,090
-
,
So, these are big planets though
-
 
 
These are planets the size of out Jupiter, Saturn and smallest Neptune sized
330
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:17,560
--
    
Oh, little Neptune
---
 
 
So it
s quite exciting that they are finding planets of Jupiter sized
 But even those a few times bigger than the earth
331
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:22,630
  
Well, no Earth-like planets have yet been found
 The search continues 
332
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:27,210
How do you pick a star as a candidate
333
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:36,380
  
,
We indeed try to choose stars that are more or less like our Sun
 
some more massive some less massive, or sort of middle age or older so they
ve settled down
334
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:46,690
  
What you want for an earth like planet to make it habitable is that temperature has to be just right
 
 
Not so cold, the water
s locked up in the ice
 
335
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:50,240
Not so hot, that the water if that evaporated into steam
336
00:37:50,370 --> 00:38:00,090
 
 
But the planet just the right distance from its star 
 
so that the temperature is just right for liquid water over billions of years to let Darwinian evolution do its things
337
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:05,020
-
Sound like the Goldilocks and her porridge
 
-
,
That
s right
 You don
t want it to be too hot or too cold
338
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:12,410
Suppose you have a telescope, a cosmos, a device, sensitive enough to find an earth-like planet
339
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:16,610
Would you point at some of stars that you are already identified as having planetx
340
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:28,190
  
Absolutely, the Jupiterx and Saturnx we are finding are the signpost 
 
the benchmarks of system that might harobr earth
341
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:33,160
and dspecially if those Jupiterx far enough from the host star
That leaves room for an earth in the habitable zone to be orbiting that star
342
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:39,130
What made you go looking for planets on other stars
343
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,990
,
,
Oh, I remember when I was a young kid, I thought to myself, I wonder if there are other earth out there 
344
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:51,190
,
and if so of any are habitable
and then is there life on those planets, and particular intelligent life
345
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:57,940
,
We humans I think in general would love to know are we alone in the universe
346
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,030
Are there other creature out there that think and dream and indeed are searching for us
347
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:10,700
,
 
In the end, I think we humans are trying to find out our roots out there chemically and biologically among the stars
348
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:15,990
The Universe is Accelerating
349
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:27,140
As the universe expanded following the big gang
,
logic indicted that the gravitational attraction of all matter should pull at that expanding material and cause the expansion to slow
350
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,950
But how much was the universe slowing down
351
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:42,650
20
90
,
In the nineteen nineties, the Hubble
s space telescope made it possible for teams of scientists to answer the question
 
1A
 by studying the brightness of light from a special type of the exploding star called a type 1A supernova
352
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:49,370
 
I paid a visit to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in San Francisco
353
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:54,970
 
and met with astrophysicist Saul Perlmutter who has a supernova cosmology project
354
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,940
So, what did you find out
355
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:05,760
 
So, we started to make measurement to try to find how much the universe in its sustention is slowing down
356
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:12,120
 
:
,
When we first saw the data,You say well, that
s kind of funny, looks the universe isn
t slowing down
357
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:23,500
 
But you think, well we are already in the mid of doing all these checks, and collaborations and confirmations
I am sure once we get over the numbers, you
ll check out and figure out  
358
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,910
--
 
that the effect will go away and change the signs somewhere that will fix
--
 
,
There are minus signs
 Sgns are 
 like that
359
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:36,300
 
,
You check each step and of the process
 Little by little
  
you  get the point we start you know this effect isn
t going way
 This is the right answer
360
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,200
It really looks like the universe is actually speeding up
361
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,510
So, why is this so important
362
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:53,860
 
 
 
This acceleration of universe doesn
t fit at all
 We understand, 
pretty well the all forces of our universe and all the objects of our universe and this is the first time we come cross something that we wouldn
t have predicted
363
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:59,200
  
Now, we are having the fun to try to  figure out what does this all mean
,
And if you come with me, I will show you what we are doing about
364
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,420
 2001
>
-
Why is it accelerating
365
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:12,110
,
Oh, that
s the question, we are all dying to know the answer, 
,
and when we think about this if you have a energy of this odd sort that would pervade all space
 
366
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:16,310
 
It can actually speed up the universe when gravity is trying to slow it down
367
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,200
  
And we are calling it dark energy, just reflecting the fact we don
t know what it is
368
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,080
-
It
s a mystery
-
,
,
it
s completely mysterious, bizarre
 We
ve no idea what it is
369
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:28,000
We wanted studies to figure out what could dark energy be like
370
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,170
 
We want to do now is get data that could help pull apart the different answers
371
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,930
So, where are you going to have data
372
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:41,820
 
The big pictures of goal that were after is a project that you see you around you here which is a satellite project
373
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:48,090
SNAP
 
The design here we called SNAP which is short for supernova acceleration probe
374
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:58,080
  
This would be a new space telescope with a very very big field of view
 
So instead of looking througha little key hole of the universe, you
ll be looking through a big picture of window of universe
375
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:07,440
 
So let me show you what we are working on 
 
that we think might help us get out why the universe is accelerating, what this dark energy really is
376
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:14,330
SNAP 
Here we have SNAP that we are hoping to be launched just in the future
377
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:21,000
This one goes out to a location out past the moon
 
378
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:31,150
From that point, you can measure expansion history with such detail 
that we could actually see the little changes when it goes to deceleration to acceleration 
379
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:37,720
Backwards universe was really dense and close together
 
Gravity is more important, it slows the expansion down
380
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:47,260
 
 
As it is kept expanding though even it went slower and slower and loss out 
 
and gravity became less important than the dark energy which took over and started to accelerate expansion,
381
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:55,290
And we are after exactly how that change over occur 
that would tell us about what different possible theories could be right to explain dark energy
382
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,660
-
,
Always expanding
 Exactly always speeding up 
-
exactly
383
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:12,710
,
 
It is an issue of it got slow down and come to a wobble and then take off
 
 
What was that transition like
384
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:25,570
 
Just like the ancient astronomers
modern scientists have discovered something about the cosmos that we cannot yet explain
385
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:31,220
It will up to observers and theorists to figure out what
s going on in our expanding universe
386
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:35,470
For this, only new ideas and better instruments
387
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:39,600
No matter this mystery will solve soon or far in the future
388
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:46,070
It could be certain of one thing
 
 
We will keep watching the skies, to understand our place in the cosmos
 
389
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:51,520
 
We will continue to explore, understand and discover 
390
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,520
391
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,520
CHD
392
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,520
