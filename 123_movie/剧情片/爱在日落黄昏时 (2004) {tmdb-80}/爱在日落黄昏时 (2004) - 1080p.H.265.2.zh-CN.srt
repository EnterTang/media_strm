00:01:45,036 --> 00:01:47,008
《此时》读者见面会 作者：杰西·华莱士

3
00:01:47,057 --> 00:01:49,651
你认为这本书算自传式的吗？

4
00:01:51,094 --> 00:01:53,153
这个...
Well, I mean...

5
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,163
...什么书不是自传式的呢？
...isn't everything autobiographical?

6
00:01:56,333 --> 00:02:00,793
我们都是通过自己那小小的钥匙孔 看外面的世界，对吧？
I mean, we all see the world through our own tiny keyhole, right?

7
00:02:01,004 --> 00:02:02,904
我是说，我总想起汤玛斯·沃尔夫说的
I mean, I always think of Thomas Wolfe.

8
00:02:03,106 --> 00:02:06,371
你看过“天使望故乡”那本书 前面那短短一页的“致读者”吗？
Have you ever seen that little one-page "Note to Reader"...

9
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,670
你知道我在说什么吧？
<i>...in the front of Look Homeward, Angel?</i>

10
00:02:09,446 --> 00:02:14,383
总之，他说我们的生命就是 由点点滴滴集合而成的
Anyway, he says that we are the sum of all the moments of our lives...

11
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:18,351
...而任何人坐下来，写出来的 都不过是自己生命中的体验...
...and anybody who sits down to write will use the clay of their own life...

12
00:02:18,522 --> 00:02:20,046
...谁都无法回避
...that you can't avoid that.

13
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:25,126
所以当我审视我的人生， 我必须得承认，我发现...
So when I look at my own life, I have to admit, right, that I...

14
00:02:25,429 --> 00:02:29,923
我从来没有经历过枪林弹雨 或是暴力事件，起码没真正体验过
I've never been around a bunch of guns or violence, you know, not really.

15
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:34,069
没有什么政治阴谋， 也没什么直升机失事
No political intrigue or a helicopter crash, right?

16
00:02:34,705 --> 00:02:38,766
但是我的人生，从我个人观点来看 仍然是富有戏剧性的
But my life, from my own point of view, has been full of drama, right?

17
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,877
于是我想也许我也能写本书...
And so I thought, if I could write a book...

18
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:46,482
...记录下我见到某人时的感觉
...that could capture what it's like to really meet somebody...

19
00:02:46,717 --> 00:02:49,379
我是说，我经历过的最刺激的事情之一
One of the most exciting things that's happened to me...

20
00:02:49,553 --> 00:02:51,851
...就是真正和某人见面， 让两个人心灵相通
...is to meet somebody, make that connection.

21
00:02:52,055 --> 00:02:56,082
而如果我能把它表现出来 你明白吗，抓住那一刻的感觉...
And if I could make that valuable, you know, to capture that...

22
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,059
...那就是我的写作意图了，亦或者....
...that would be the attempt, or...

23
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,088
你满意我的回答吗？
Did I answer your question?

24
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:06,101
我干脆就直说吧...
I'll try to be more specific.

25
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,266
我在火车上遇见一个年轻的法国女郎
Was there ever a French young woman on a train you met...

26
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,771
并和她共度良宵
...and spent an evening with?

27
00:03:15,645 --> 00:03:18,580
这个，对我来说...我是说...
See, to me, that... I mean...

28
00:03:18,749 --> 00:03:22,185
- ...这并不重要，你懂吗？ - 就是说的确有了？
...that's not important, you know? - So that's a yes?

29
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,113
好吧，既然我人在法国，这又是 我签名售书的最后一站，那就算有吧
All right, since I'm in France and this is the last stop of my book tour, yes.

30
00:03:27,924 --> 00:03:29,755
谢谢
Thank you.

31
00:03:29,926 --> 00:03:33,327
华莱士先生，这本书的结尾给我们留下了悬念
Mr. Wallace, the book ends on an ambiguous note.

32
00:03:33,497 --> 00:03:34,828
我们不知道
We don't know.

33
00:03:35,031 --> 00:03:37,625
你认为他们六个月之后会重聚吗？
Do you think they get back together in six months...

34
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:41,268
就像他们彼此承诺的那样？
...like they promise each other?

35
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:43,805
像他们保证的？
Like they promised?

36
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:48,105
我认为这个问题实际上是，是个....
I think how you answer that, you know, is...

37
00:03:48,945 --> 00:03:52,210
是个很好的测试，看看你到底是 喜欢浪漫还是对它嗤之以鼻
It's a good test, right, if you're a romantic or a cynic.

38
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:56,442
我是说，你认为他们会重聚的，对吧？
Right? I mean, you think they get back together, right?

39
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,144
- 显然你并不这么认为 - 是的
- You don't, for sure. - No.

40
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,312
还是你希望他们会 不过你无法肯定
And you hope they do, but you're not sure.

41
00:04:00,524 --> 00:04:04,187
- 所以你才问这个问题 - 你认为他们会重聚吗？
- That's why you're asking the question. - Do you think they get back together?

42
00:04:04,428 --> 00:04:06,521
我是说你们重聚了吗？ 在现实生活中？
I mean, did you in real life?

43
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,829
现实生活中...？
Did I in real...?

44
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,794
要用我祖父的话来说啊
Look, in the words of my grandfather, okay:

45
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:16,063
天晓得会不会
"To answer that would take the piss out of the whole thing. "

46
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:20,465
我们的时间只够问最后一个问题了
We just have the time for one last question.

47
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,372
你下一本书将是什么？
What is your next book?

48
00:04:24,981 --> 00:04:27,472
我不知道，老兄，我真的不知道...
I don't know, man. I don't know.

49
00:04:27,717 --> 00:04:31,175
我一直...一直在考虑这个构思...
I've been... I've been thinking about this...

50
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,050
我总是想写本书...
Well, I always kind of wanted to write a book...

51
00:04:34,224 --> 00:04:37,887
...一切都发生在一首流行歌曲那么长时间内
...that all took place within the space of a pop song.

52
00:04:38,094 --> 00:04:41,222
总共大概3到4分钟吧
Like three or four minutes long, the whole thing.

53
00:04:41,465 --> 00:04:44,957
整个故事大概是说有个男人...
The story, the idea, is that there's this guy, right...

54
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:47,864
...他非常的沮丧，因为...
...and he's totally depressed.

55
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:52,235
他最大的梦想就是拥有一段 轰轰烈烈的爱情，一次冒险...
His great dream was to be a lover, an adventurer, you know...

56
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:55,173
...比如开着摩托周游南美
...riding motorcycles through South America.

57
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,108
但是事实上他只是坐在大理石桌前吃着龙虾
And instead he's sitting at a marble table eating lobster.

58
00:04:58,281 --> 00:05:01,375
他有份不错的工作，妻子也很漂亮
He's got a good job and a beautiful wife, right, but that...

59
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,918
他应有尽有，但是这并不是他真正想要的...
Everything that he needs. But that doesn't matter...

60
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:08,090
...因为他真正想要的是为某种理想而战
...because what he wants is to fight for meaning.

61
00:05:08,358 --> 00:05:10,588
你明白吗，快乐来自于过程
You know? Happiness is in the doing, right?

62
00:05:10,794 --> 00:05:13,092
而不是因为你得到了你想要的东西
Not in the getting what you want.

63
00:05:13,296 --> 00:05:16,788
总之，他坐在那里，突然间...
So he's sitting there, and just that second...

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,232
...他五岁的小女儿跳上了桌子
...his little 5-year-old daughter hops up on the table.

65
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,703
他知道她该下来，因为她可能会受伤
And he knows that she should get down, because she could get hurt.

66
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:29,607
但是她正穿着夏日的裙子 随着那首歌翩翩起舞
But she's dancing to this pop song in a summer dress.

67
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,238
然后一晃眼
And he looks down...

68
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:34,940
...突然间，他回到了十六岁
...and all of a sudden, he's 6.

69
00:05:35,785 --> 00:05:41,246
他的高中女友正送他回家
And his high-school sweetheart is dropping him off at home.

70
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:44,985
而他们刚刚度过了他们的初夜 她很爱他...
And they just lost their virginity, and she loves him...

71
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:49,120
...而汽车收音机里里播放着的 是同样的一首曲子
...and the same song is playing on the car radio.

72
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:52,334
然后她爬上了车顶，开始在那里跳舞
And she climbs up and starts dancing on the roof of the car.

73
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:54,093
这一下，他开始很担心她！
And now he's worried about her.

74
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:58,571
她很美，表情也竟然和她女儿一模一样
And she's beautiful, with a facial expression just like his daughter's.

75
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:01,070
事实上，这可能就是 他为什么会喜欢她的原因
In fact, maybe that's why he even likes her.

76
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:04,179
你懂吗，他知道他并不是身处回忆之中...
You see, he knows he's not remembering this dance...

77
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:08,111
...而是他就在那里，他同时 出现在人生的两个场景之中
...he's there. He's there, in both moments, simultaneously.

78
00:06:08,318 --> 00:06:11,754
就在这一瞬间，他全部的人生 好像都交汇到了一起
And just for an instant, all his life is just folding in on itself.

79
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,651
对他来说，时间明显是个谎言
And it's obvious to him that time is a lie.

80
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,428
因为那一刻将一直延伸下去...
That it's all happening all the time...

81
00:06:19,596 --> 00:06:23,157
..而且.每个时刻之内都包含着另一个时刻...
...and inside every moment is another moment...

82
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:25,264
...一切的一切，都发生在同一瞬间
...all happening simultaneously.

83
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,562
总之，这就是我大概的想法，总之
Anyway, that's kind of the idea. Anyway.

84
00:06:29,873 --> 00:06:32,273
我们的作者很快就得去机场了...
Our author has to be going to the airport soon...

85
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,376
...那么，谢谢各位今天下午光临
...so thank you all very much for coming over this afternoon.

86
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:38,843
尤其要感谢华莱士先生和我们 共度了这么美好的一个下午
And a special thanks to Mr. Wallace for being with us.

87
00:06:39,082 --> 00:06:40,481
谢谢，谢谢
Thank you. Thank you.

88
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,346
希望你出下本书的时候 我们还能在这见到你！
We hope to see you here again with your next book.

89
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,500
（法语）感谢大家光临

90
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,000
（法语）我们为大家准备了香槟和一些小点心

91
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
（法语）请尽情享受吧
Thank you all. How much longer before I have to go to the airport?

92
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,327
谢谢各位，我必须在几点之前去机场？

93
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,123
哦，你必须在七点半之前离开？
Oh, you should leave at 7:30...

94
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:57,890
- 最迟七点半！ - 好
- Seven-thirty at the very latest. - Okay.

95
00:07:02,806 --> 00:07:06,139
- 嗨 - 你好
- Hi. - Hello.

96
00:07:08,745 --> 00:07:11,475
- 你还好吗？ - 很好，你呢？
- How are you? - Good, and you?

97
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:16,047
挺好，是的，我很好，我...
I'm good, yeah, I'm great. I'm...

98
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,185
你愿意...我是说...去喝杯咖啡什么的吗？
Do you wanna, maybe, get a cup of coffee?

99
00:07:19,923 --> 00:07:22,391
他不是说你要赶飞机吗？
Didn't he just say you have a plane to catch?

100
00:07:23,426 --> 00:07:26,361
是啊...不过时间还早
Yeah. But, I mean, I have a little time.

101
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:30,029
- 那好吧 - 好吗？好，那，让我....
- Okay. - Yeah? All right, well, let me...

102
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:32,326
我在外面等你
I'll meet you outside. Okay.

103
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,436
我出去一下，喝杯咖啡
Excuse me. I'm just gonna go get a cup of coffee.

104
00:07:36,673 --> 00:07:38,903
- 我七点一刻回来 - 这些书你都签了名吗？
- I'll be back at 7: 5. - Did you sign all these?

105
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:41,703
- 是的，我肯定签了 - 拿着你的司机菲利普的名片...
- Yeah, I sure did. - Get your driver Philippe's card...

106
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:44,402
...这样你要是晚了，就用手机给他打电话
...so you can call his cell if you're running late.

107
00:07:44,648 --> 00:07:47,208
我们会把你的包放在车里 这样你就不会晚了
We'll put your bags in the car so you're not late.

108
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:49,942
- 好的，谢谢你 - （法语）非常感谢
- All right, thanks for everything. - Thank you.

109
00:07:52,288 --> 00:07:54,256
谁是菲利普？
Which one's Philippe?

110
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,900
（法语）菲利普，把你的名片给他， 上面有你的手机号码

111
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,900
（法语）谢谢

112
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:15,541
- 真难以置信你会在这里 - 我就住在巴黎
- I can't believe you're here. - I live here in Paris.

113
00:08:16,946 --> 00:08:20,279
你真的不用多呆几天吗？ 你不用再和谁谈什么了吗？
Are you sure you don't have to stay? You're not supposed to talk more?

114
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:22,542
不，他们都开始烦我了 我昨晚整夜都在这里
They're sick of me. I spent the night here.

115
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,085
- 哦，真的吗？ - 是啊，他们楼上有间阁楼
- You did? - Yeah, they got a loft upstairs.

116
00:08:26,456 --> 00:08:28,822
- 你怎么样？这感觉真奇怪 - 我很好
- How are you? This is so weird. - I'm fine.

117
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:32,756
- 见到你真高兴！ - 见到你真高兴！
- It's good to see you. - It's good to see you.

118
00:08:35,131 --> 00:08:37,565
- 那你想去喝杯咖啡吗？ - 哦，当然
- So you want to go to a caf? - Yeah.

119
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,133
那好，那边不远有一家很不错
Okay. There's one a little further that I like.

120
00:08:40,303 --> 00:08:44,205
我刚才见到你的时候我都快傻了
I thought I was gonna totally lose it in there when I first saw you.

121
00:08:44,407 --> 00:08:46,136
你怎么会知道我会来这的呢？
How did you know I was gonna be here?

122
00:08:46,342 --> 00:08:50,745
这是我在巴黎最喜欢的书店了 你可以坐在那里看一天书
It's my favorite bookstore in Paris. You can sit down for hours and read.

123
00:08:50,914 --> 00:08:52,905
我很喜欢这样，那儿是有跳蚤，不过，你知道的....
I love it. There's fleas, but, you know...

124
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,449
我知道，我简直感觉昨晚有只猫睡在我头上
I know. I think a cat slept on my head last night.

125
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,246
我一个月前就书店日历上看到你的照片
I saw your picture on the calendar about a month ago...

126
00:08:58,421 --> 00:09:00,286
知道你会来这里
...and that you were going to be here.

127
00:09:00,724 --> 00:09:03,625
有意思的是，我读了你的书，一小段而已
It's funny, because I read an article on your book...

128
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:07,786
- 我有种朦朦胧胧的的亲切感 - 朦朦胧胧？是吗？
...and it sounded vaguely familiar. - Vaguely? Yeah.

129
00:09:08,164 --> 00:09:11,998
是的，只不过是在见到你的照片 之后才有的，所以...
But I didn't put it all together until I saw your photo. So...

130
00:09:12,168 --> 00:09:14,329
你看过那书了吗？
Did you have a chance to read it?

131
00:09:14,537 --> 00:09:15,970
是的，我....
Yes, I...

132
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,607
你的书让我感到惊喜，你应该体会得到的
I was really, really surprised, as you can imagine.

133
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,436
我是说，我对它爱不释手
I mean, I had to read it twice, actually.

134
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,669
- 是吗？ - 是的
- Yeah? - Yeah.

135
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,100
（法语）写得马马虎虎？
No, I liked it. It's very romantic.

136
00:09:25,115 --> 00:09:27,709
不，我很喜欢，非常浪漫！

137
00:09:27,884 --> 00:09:30,546
我平时不爱看类似的书 但是你写的真好
I usually don't like that, but it's really well-written.

138
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:33,779
- 写的非常好，祝贺你！ - 好吧，谢谢
- It's well-written. Congratulations. - All right. Thank you.

139
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,055
- 等等 - 怎么啦？
- Wait. - What?

140
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:40,251
在我们出发前，我得问你...
Before we go anywhere, I have to ask you...

141
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,221
没问题，什么事？
Sure. What?

142
00:09:42,398 --> 00:09:45,390
那年十二月，你去维也纳了吗？
Did you show up in Vienna that December?

143
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:51,639
- 呃，你去了吗？ - 没有，我没能去成，但是...你去了吗？
- Did you? - No, I couldn't. But did you?

144
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:55,175
- 我必须要知道，这对我很重要！ - 为什么，既然你都没去？
- I need to know. It's important to me. - Why, if you didn't?

145
00:09:55,545 --> 00:09:57,536
那，你去了吗？
Well, did you?

146
00:09:57,714 --> 00:09:59,204
没有
No.

147
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,340
哦，谢天谢地你没去！
Thank God you didn't.

148
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:04,349
- 哦，天啊 - 谢天谢地你没去
- Oh, my God. - Thank God you didn't.

149
00:10:04,554 --> 00:10:08,046
我是说，幸亏我没去，你也没去 要是我们两个只有一个人去了...
Thank God I didn't and you didn't. If one of us had showed up alone...

150
00:10:08,224 --> 00:10:10,658
- ...那简直是糟透了 - 我知道，我知道，我一直担心这个
...that would have sucked. - I was so concerned.

151
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:14,695
我一直因为没去而内疚，但是我确实没法！ 我祖母那之前几天过世了
I felt horrible about not being there, but I couldn't. My grandma died...

152
00:10:14,898 --> 00:10:17,162
那天是她下葬的日子，十二月十六日
...and she was buried that day, December 6th.

153
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,927
- 她过世了？就是布达佩斯的那一位？ - 是的，你还记得？
- The one in Budapest? - Yes. You remember that?

154
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,934
- 当然，我什么都记得 - 噢，对了，你书中还提到了
- I remember everything. - Of course, it was in your book.

155
00:10:23,106 --> 00:10:26,405
总之，我的确想过去维也纳的
But anyway, I was about to fly to Vienna, you know...

156
00:10:26,609 --> 00:10:30,670
但是噩耗突然传来，我只能去参加葬礼了
...and we heard the news about her, and of course I had to go to the funeral.

157
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:32,576
是啊，听到这个真让人难过
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.

158
00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:36,515
我知道，反正你也没去...
I know. But you weren't there anyway.

159
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,210
等等，你为什么没去？
Wait. Why weren't you there?

160
00:10:39,422 --> 00:10:42,755
我要是能去的话一定会去的 我定了计划，而且我...
I would have been there if I could have. I made plans...

161
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,189
你最好能找到个好一点的理由！
You better have a good reason.

162
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,726
怎么了？
What?

163
00:10:48,832 --> 00:10:50,265
哦，不！
Oh, no.

164
00:10:50,934 --> 00:10:52,959
你去那了，是吗？
No, you were there, weren't you?

165
00:10:53,203 --> 00:10:55,865
哦，不，真糟糕！
Oh, no, that's terrible!

166
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,767
我知道，我笑了，不过我不是有意的！
I'm laughing, but I don't mean it.

167
00:10:57,941 --> 00:10:59,806
你当时生我气了吧，一定是的
Did you hate me? You must've hated me.

168
00:10:59,976 --> 00:11:02,240
- 你一直都在生我的气吧？一定是的 - 没有
- Have you been hating me all this time? - No.

169
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:03,743
- 有，你生我气了 - 没有
- Yes, you have. - No.

170
00:11:03,947 --> 00:11:05,778
但你现在不生气了，对吧？
But you can't hate me now, right?

171
00:11:05,982 --> 00:11:09,110
- 我是说，我祖母... - 我没生你的气，又不是什么大事
- I mean, my grandma... - I don't hate you. It's no big deal.

172
00:11:09,352 --> 00:11:11,877
我大老远飞过去，你却放我的鸽子
I flew all the way over there, you blew the thing off.

173
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,148
于是我的人生自此一蹶不振 不过，这又算什么呢
My life's been a big nosedive since, but it's not a problem.

174
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:18,224
- 我只是开玩笑，开玩笑 - 别这么说，我真无法相信
- No, I'm kidding. - Don't say that. I can't believe it.

175
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,896
我一定是把你气疯了，我真抱歉
You must have been so angry with me. I'm so sorry.

176
00:11:21,064 --> 00:11:23,589
我真的很想去的，没什么比这个更重要了！
I wanted to be there, more than anything in the world.

177
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,496
- 不开玩笑了，我发誓... - 你不能生气啊，我祖母...
- Honestly, I swear... - You can't be angry, my grandmother...

178
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:30,332
我懂，我真的想到了， 你大概就是被这种事情缠住了
I know. I honestly thought that something like that might have happened.

179
00:11:30,506 --> 00:11:32,599
我确实是非常失望，不过...
I was definitely bummed, but...

180
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:36,472
我感到最遗憾的还是因为我们没有 交换电话号码，或者任何其他个人信息
Mostly I was mad we hadn't exchanged any phone numbers or any information.

181
00:11:36,646 --> 00:11:38,637
瞧瞧我们干的傻事，没法彼此联系
That was so stupid. No way to get in touch.

182
00:11:38,815 --> 00:11:41,147
- 对啊，没法继续下去了 - 我甚至不知道你姓什么
- Nothing to go on. - I didn't know your last name.

183
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:44,514
记得吗，我们都担心如果我们开始通信，打电话...
Remember, we were both afraid if we started writing and calling...

184
00:11:44,687 --> 00:11:48,248
- ...感觉会不会慢慢的就变淡了 - 是啊，而且肯定不会慢慢变淡
...that it would slowly fade out. - It definitely wasn't a slow fade.

185
00:11:48,424 --> 00:11:49,652
肯定不会
No, it sure wasn't.

186
00:11:49,826 --> 00:11:51,657
我们都怀念曾经拥有的感觉
We wanted to pick up where we left off.

187
00:11:51,828 --> 00:11:55,195
如果这份感觉可以永存的话 那就再好不过了
Which would have been fine if it had worked. Oh, well.

188
00:11:56,532 --> 00:11:58,090
那么....
So...

189
00:11:58,668 --> 00:12:01,899
- 你在维也纳待了多久？ - 就几天
- How long were you in Vienna, then? - Just a couple days.

190
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:05,600
你碰到其他女孩了吗？
Did you meet another girl?

191
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,402
啊，是啊，她叫格蕾岑，她棒极了
Yeah, her name was Gretchen and she was amazing.

192
00:12:08,611 --> 00:12:11,307
- 真的？ - 是啊，事实上，那书是写你们两个的
The book's really a composite of the two of you.

193
00:12:11,308 --> 00:12:12,300
真的吗？
No, I'm kidding. You wouldn't believe... I even went back to the train station.

194
00:12:12,308 --> 00:12:15,314
没这回事，我只是开玩笑！ 你不会相信的，我甚至还回到火车站过

195
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:19,614
我支了个牌子，写了我旅馆的电话号码， 以免你来晚了找不到
I put up signs of my number in the hotel in case you'd been delayed.

196
00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:22,451
- 我真是个笨蛋 - 我们这边走，有人打电话给你吗？
- I was a total dork. - Let's go this way. Did you get any calls?

197
00:12:22,859 --> 00:12:25,851
有几个妓女，拉皮条的
Just a couple hookers looking for a gig.

198
00:12:26,062 --> 00:12:28,622
哦，那真是糟，我是说，你指望让我说什么呢
No, it was awful, I mean, what do you want me to say?

199
00:12:28,798 --> 00:12:30,197
哦，太让人伤心了，我真抱歉！
It's so sad. I'm so sorry.

200
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:33,493
我就那么转悠了几天，最后，就飞回去了
I walked around for a couple days. Eventually, I flew home.

201
00:12:33,703 --> 00:12:35,967
还欠了我爸2000块
I owed my dad 2000 bucks...

202
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,163
他可是警告我不要碰法国鸡
...who had warned me about French chicks.

203
00:12:38,374 --> 00:12:40,239
他怎么对你形容法国女人的？
What did he tell you about French women?

204
00:12:40,476 --> 00:12:42,535
没什么，他，他从来没有遇见过法国女人
Nothing. He's never met any French women.

205
00:12:42,745 --> 00:12:45,009
他从来没有去过比密西西比河更东的地方
He's never been east of the Mississippi.

206
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:49,413
那你干嘛不加上一句，“六个月过去了， 那个法国婊子还是没出现”
Why didn't you put, "Six months later, the French bitch didn't show up"?

207
00:12:49,585 --> 00:12:51,177
不，可是我差点这么做了
No, but I did, I did.

208
00:12:51,387 --> 00:12:54,322
- 你真的想过？ - 是的，我是说，我让它看起来更有悬念
- You did? - Yeah. No. I made it more hopeful.

209
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,049
我写了一段虚构的情节，说你最后出现了
I wrote this fictional version where you do show up.

210
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,728
- 哦，你怎么写的？ - 呃...
- Oh, what happens? - Well...

211
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,657
怎么了？
What?

212
00:13:03,066 --> 00:13:06,058
呃，我们整整做了十天爱，这还没完
We make love for about 0 days straight, that's one part of it.

213
00:13:06,235 --> 00:13:09,033
- 哦，真有意思，一个法国荡妇... - 没错
- Interesting. So the French slut, right? - Yeah, exactly.

214
00:13:09,238 --> 00:13:11,729
从那以后，他们开始了解对方
It's just then they get to know each other better...

215
00:13:11,908 --> 00:13:13,899
然后他们意识到彼此并不合适
...and realize they don't get along at all.

216
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:17,409
- 我喜欢这样，看起来更真实 - 我的编辑可不这么想
- I like that. It's more real. - My editor didn't think that way.

217
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,707
谁都想相信爱情，为了畅销嘛，对吧？
Everyone wants to believe in love. It sells.

218
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,873
是啊，就是如此，所以...
Yeah, exactly, so...

219
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:25,179
就是说你一切都好，对吧？
So things are going well for you, right? I mean...

220
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:28,585
- 我是说，你的书是美国畅销书... - 只是本小小的畅销书
- Your book is a bestseller in the U. S. - It's a tiny bestseller.

221
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,782
- 哦，别谦虚啦... - 好吧，没错，理论上说，是的
- Oh, come on. - All right. Officially, yes.

222
00:13:31,027 --> 00:13:34,121
可大多数人连莫比·迪克的书都没读过 又怎么会来读我的？
<i>Most people haven't read Moby Dick. Why should they read my book?</i>

223
00:13:34,297 --> 00:13:36,561
我也没读过莫比·迪克的书 可是我就喜欢你的书，所以...
<i>I haven't read Moby Dick and I liked your book.</i>

224
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,031
- 谢谢 - 即使...
- Thanks. - Even though...

225
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,999
我觉得你把那一晚描绘得太完美了
...I thought you idealized the night of it.

226
00:13:42,205 --> 00:13:43,900
嘿，我说，这可是小说
Come on, it's fiction, right?

227
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,734
- 我本来就得... - 我知道，我知道
- I'm supposed to... - I know, I know.

228
00:13:45,942 --> 00:13:49,139
你知道，有些时候，你让我看起来...
I know. I thought there were times where you made me...

229
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:53,748
呃，我是说她， 不，还是我...算啦，管她是谁
Well, I mean, her, right? No, me. Okay, whatever.

230
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,010
- 总之有点神经质！ - 你确实有点啊，不是吗？
- A little bit neurotic. - You are a bit like that, aren't you?

231
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,451
- 你认为我神经质？ - 没有，这是个玩笑而已！
- You think I'm neurotic? - No, no, no. Come on, I'm kidding.

232
00:14:00,623 --> 00:14:02,488
我哪那么写了，我才没有呢
Where did I do that? I didn't do that.

233
00:14:02,658 --> 00:14:05,388
我这人就是这样的，你知道的...
Oh, maybe it's just me, you know...

234
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:08,587
读到一个故事，知道故事是根据自己来写的
Reading something, knowing the character is based on you...

235
00:14:08,798 --> 00:14:11,460
这既让人受宠若惊，也让人心神不宁
...it's both flattering and disturbing at the same time.

236
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:13,157
怎么会让人心神不宁的？
How is it disturbing?

237
00:14:13,403 --> 00:14:17,601
我不知道，只是... 成为他人记忆中的一部分
I don't know. Just being part of someone else's memory.

238
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:20,402
透过你的眼看到我自己
Seeing myself through your eyes.

239
00:14:20,576 --> 00:14:22,976
你写了多久？
How long did it take you to write it?

240
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,743
呃，三四年吧，时断时续的
Three or four years, on and off.

241
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:29,111
哇，你花了那么长时间就为了写 一个晚上发生的事情？
Wow, that's a really long time to be writing about one night.

242
00:14:29,318 --> 00:14:31,980
是啊，我知道，你说的没错
Yeah, I know. Tell me about it.

243
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,756
我总是认为你已经忘记我了
I always assumed you had forgotten me.

244
00:14:35,158 --> 00:14:37,922
没有，我心目中你的印象非常清晰
No, I had a pretty clear picture of you in my mind.

245
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,527
- 我得告诉你件事情，我... - 怎么了？
- I have to tell you something. I just... - What?

246
00:14:40,831 --> 00:14:43,076
这么久以来，我一直想和你聊天 你知道吗，而现在...
I've wanted to talk to you for so long that now... It's just surreal, you know?

247
00:14:43,077 --> 00:14:44,077
- 是啊，我也是 - 现在梦想成真了
I feel like everything should be...

248
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:46,001
我却觉得不知道该说什么了

249
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,070
我懂，我懂，我们还有多长时间？ 20分钟又30秒？
How long do we have? Twenty minutes and 30 seconds?

250
00:14:49,272 --> 00:14:51,570
不，我们有的是时间 我想多和你聊聊
We got more than that. I wanna know about you.

251
00:14:51,774 --> 00:14:54,368
告诉我你在做什么？
Tell me, what are you doing? What are you up to?

252
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:59,206
呃，从哪开始呢... 我为绿十字会工作，那是个环保组织
Where to start? I work for Green Cross. It's an environmental organization.

253
00:14:59,449 --> 00:15:00,780
他们是干嘛的？
What are they all about?

254
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,543
这个嘛，基本上来说，我们会关注一些环境问题
We basically work on different environment issues...

255
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:06,347
比如净化水质，或者销毁化学武器什么的
...from clean water to disarmament of chemical weapons.

256
00:15:06,522 --> 00:15:08,990
你懂吗，涉及环境的国际法什么的
International laws that deal with the environment.

257
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,524
- 那，你为他们做什么？ - 我们走这边
- What do you do for them? - We're going this way.

258
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:13,292
很多事了
Different things.

259
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:17,364
比如去年，我在印度待了一阵 在一间水处理工厂工作
Like, last year I was in India for a while, working on a water-treatment plant.

260
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,500
那里的棉纺工业是主要的污染源，所以...
Well, the cotton industry there is a major source of pollution, so...

261
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:24,606
我是说，听起来你的确做了一些有意义的事情
I mean, it sounds like you're actually doing something.

262
00:15:24,807 --> 00:15:28,243
大多数人，也包括我，只是... 你知道吗，无所事事
Most people, myself included, just sit around and bitch.

263
00:15:28,411 --> 00:15:33,075
美国消耗了世界上大多数资源， 箱式轿车尤其如此
You know, how America's consuming all the world's resources, SUVs suck...

264
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:34,648
全球也在变暖...
...global warming is real...

265
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:38,218
很高兴你不是那种狂妄自大的美国人
I'm relieved to hear you're not one of those "freedom fries" Americans.

266
00:15:38,387 --> 00:15:40,821
不过，你是怎么会去做这个的呢？
Hey, you know... But how'd you get into that?

267
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:44,255
啊，我政治系毕了业 那时我希望为政府工作
I came out of political science, hoping to work for the government.

268
00:15:44,494 --> 00:15:47,190
- 而我确实也替他们干了一阵，哎，太糟了！ - 不好吗？
- And I did for a little while. Terrible. - Not good?

269
00:15:47,396 --> 00:15:51,025
是的，不好，我们这边走 总之，我烦透了...
Yeah, no. Anyway, I got really tired... Let's go this way.

270
00:15:51,234 --> 00:15:53,532
... 与朋友无休止的讨论...
Having this endless conversation with friends...

271
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,933
关于世界怎么会分裂成这样的问题
...about how the world was falling to pieces.

272
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:58,572
所以我意识到我真正想要做的
So I decided what I really wanted to do was...

273
00:15:58,774 --> 00:16:02,141
就是找到一些可以做好的事情， 然后努力做好它们
...to find things that could be fixed and try to fix them, you know?

274
00:16:02,345 --> 00:16:06,076
我一直觉得你会做这种超酷的事情的
You know, I always thought you'd be doing something cool like that. I did.

275
00:16:06,282 --> 00:16:11,219
谢谢！不过我真的很幸运， 能找到份自己喜欢的工作
Thanks. I just feel really, really lucky to be doing a job I like, you know?

276
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,887
是啊
Yeah.

277
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:17,788
你知道吗，事实上我曾经非常彷徨 一会儿认为这个世界已经没救了...
I actually alternate in between thinking everything is irrevocably screwed up...

278
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,258
一会儿又认为很多时候还是有转机的
...and things might be getting better in ways.

279
00:16:20,463 --> 00:16:22,897
转机？为什么要这么悲观呢？
Better? How could you possibly say that?

280
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,862
这个嘛，我只是说，你明白吗，比如...
Well, I just mean, you know, like...

281
00:16:25,034 --> 00:16:28,697
我知道这听起来很奇怪， 不过有些事情还是要从好的方面来看
I know it sounds weird, but there are things to be optimistic about.

282
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:33,604
好啦，我知道你的书畅销 这非常好，我为你感到高兴，不过...
Okay... I know your book is selling, which is great, I'm very happy for you.

283
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:37,074
让我告诉你真实的世界，好吗？ 世界现在是一团糟！
But let me break the news to you: The world is a mess right now.

284
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,771
从西方世界的观点来看来说，世界的确在变好
From a Western view, things are getting a bit better.

285
00:16:39,982 --> 00:16:43,577
我们正把工业重心转移到发展中国家 那里我们能获得便宜的劳动力...
We're moving industry to developing nations where we can get cheap labor...

286
00:16:43,786 --> 00:16:47,051
...而不去管任何环保法律 军火工业蓬勃发展
...free of any environmental laws. The weapon industry is booming.

287
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:50,192
每年有五百万人因为水质污染而死去 而这些本来是可以避免的
Five million people die a year from preventable water disease.

288
00:16:50,393 --> 00:16:53,385
告诉我，这样的世界还不够糟糕马？ 我没有生气，我没有生气
How is the world getting better? I'm not angry, I'm not angry.

289
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,689
不过，说吧，我想知道，我很有兴趣！
But come on, I want to know. I'm interested.

290
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:59,390
好吧，我知道世界上有很多严重的问题
I realize that there are a lot of serious problems in the world.

291
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,832
- 太好了，谢谢你！ - 我的意思是说
- Okay. Thank you. - I mean, I don't even have...

292
00:17:02,071 --> 00:17:05,438
- 我在亚洲根本找不到出版商出我的书 - 好啦
...one publisher in the Asian market. - Okay. All right.

293
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:09,077
- 说“住嘴”！ - 怎么啦？住嘴
- Say stop. - What? Stop.

294
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:13,147
听我说，我想说的只是更多的人 意识到这一点了，人们正在反击！
Look, all I'm saying is there's more awareness. People are gonna fight back.

295
00:17:13,316 --> 00:17:16,308
世界还是有可能变得更好的， 因为更多像你这样的人...
The world might be getting better because people like you...

296
00:17:16,485 --> 00:17:18,112
...学会了说出自己的想法
...are educated and speaking out.

297
00:17:18,588 --> 00:17:21,921
最起码的，那些环保问题
Even the very notion of conservation, environmental issues...

298
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,490
最近才出现在词典里
...weren't in the vocabulary till fairly recently.

299
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,756
而现在他们已经成了规范了， 而最后他们都可能被实现
And they're becoming the norm and eventually might be what's expected.

300
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:31,934
我同意你的看法 但是同时，这也很危险！
I agree with what you're saying, but at the same time it's dangerous.

301
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,762
帝国主义国家会用你这种观点...
An imperialist country can use that kind of thinking...

302
00:17:34,937 --> 00:17:37,098
...来为他们经济上的巧取豪夺找到依据
...to justify their economic greed.

303
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:42,602
你是在针对某一个帝国主义国家吧，法国佬？
Is there any particular imperialist country you have in mind, there, Frenchie?

304
00:17:42,778 --> 00:17:44,973
- 没，没有 - 没有吗？
- No, not really. - No?

305
00:17:44,973 --> 00:17:47,414
-（法语）晚上好 -（法语）晚上好

306
00:17:50,386 --> 00:17:53,878
- 你愿意坐那边吗？ - 当然，这真不错
- So you wanna sit over there? - Yeah, this is perfect.

307
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,020
哦，哇，可能我想说的只是...
Oh, wow. Maybe what I'm saying is...

308
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,161
...世界的命运就像一个人的命运一样
...the world might be evolving the way a person evolves.

309
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,355
我是说，比如我，我在退步了吗？
Like, I mean, me, for example. Am I getting worse?

310
00:18:03,532 --> 00:18:07,730
我在进步吗？我也不知道！ 当我更年轻的时候，我也更健康...
Am I improving? I don't know. When I was younger, I was healthier...

311
00:18:07,903 --> 00:18:10,394
...但是我充满了危机感，你懂吗？
...but I was wracked with insecurity, you know?

312
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,133
现在，我变老了，遇到的问题也更复杂了
Now I'm older and my problems are deeper...

313
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:15,174
但是我也更知道怎么来处理它们了
...but I'm more equipped to handle them.

314
00:18:15,911 --> 00:18:18,072
那么，你碰到什么问题了 ？
So, what are your problems?

315
00:18:19,649 --> 00:18:24,143
现在？没事 我没事，我只是...
Right now I don't have any. I don't, you know? I'm just...

316
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,049
...我真他妈高兴能在这！
...damn happy to be here.

317
00:18:26,489 --> 00:18:28,047
我也一样
Me too.

318
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,324
那，你在巴黎待了多久了？
So how long have you been in Paris?

319
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,930
我昨晚才来 12天之内我跑了10个城市
I got in last night. I've done 0 cities in 2 days.

320
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,498
我累极了，所以我很高兴一切都结束了
I'm wrecked. I'm so glad it's over, you know?

321
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,169
我已经厌倦了这种推销
I'm tired of being a huckster.

322
00:18:41,737 --> 00:18:42,621
- 嗨 - 你好
- Hi. - Hello.

323
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,414
（法语）请问您想要点什么？
What do you want?

324
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:44,929
你要点什么？
A cup of coffee.

325
00:18:45,174 --> 00:18:46,167
一杯咖啡...

326
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,900
（法语）请给我来一杯咖啡和一片柠檬

327
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,611
天，我爱死这家咖啡馆了， 我真希望美国也有这样的地方
God, I love this caf? I wish they had places like this in the U. S.

328
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,542
是啊，当我住那边的时候， 我可想念咖啡馆了
Yeah, I missed caf閟 when I was living over there.

329
00:18:57,753 --> 00:19:00,620
我是说，我是找到了一些我喜欢的地方， 但是那...
I mean, I find a few places I really liked, but there was...

330
00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:04,849
- 你...你在美国呆过？ - 是的，从...96年到99年
- You were living in the U. S.? - Yes, from '96 to '99.

331
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,619
我那时在纽约州立大学上学
I was studying at NYU.

332
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:09,623
哦，天啊，真难以相信，塞琳！
Oh, God, don't tell me that, Celine.

333
00:19:09,865 --> 00:19:11,890
- 怎么了？ - 没什么，只是...
- What? - No, it's just...

334
00:19:12,101 --> 00:19:13,796
- 没什么， 我是说我... - 怎么了
- Nothing, I mean, I... - What?

335
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:17,370
我从98年起就住在纽约了 你懂吗，我们那时都在那里！
I've been living in New York since '98. We were there at the same time.

336
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,098
- 纽约？ - 是的
- In New York? - Yeah.

337
00:19:19,275 --> 00:19:23,974
奇怪的是，事实上有几次 我想到过可能会遇见你，
That's weird. It actually crossed my mind a few times that I might run into you...

338
00:19:24,146 --> 00:19:26,478
...但是几率太低了，对吧？而且...
...but the odds are so slim, right? So...

339
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,983
我那时都不知道你住哪个城市
I didn't even know what city you were in.

340
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:32,643
- 你不是住德克萨斯吗？ - 是的，没错，正是如此，我只是...
- Weren't you somewhere in Texas? - Yeah, yeah, definitely. I just...

341
00:19:32,888 --> 00:19:36,380
我在那住了很久，我只是... 你明白吗，到纽约换换环境
I was for a long time. I just, you know, wanted to try New York.

342
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,088
那你为什么回来了呢？
What brought you back here?

343
00:19:40,296 --> 00:19:42,287
一是我读完了硕士
I had finished my master's, for one...

344
00:19:42,498 --> 00:19:44,728
再来，我的签证到期了
...and no visa, no more visa.

345
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:49,303
而且，不算这些，我也开始有点妄想狂了 媒体上那么多的暴力事件
And I was starting to get paranoid. All the violence in the medias:

346
00:19:49,472 --> 00:19:52,737
黑帮啦，谋杀啦... 尤其是那连环杀手
Gang violence, murders, especially serial killers...

347
00:19:54,377 --> 00:19:56,004
而最后决定性的原因是...
But the final straw was...

348
00:19:56,245 --> 00:19:59,112
..有天晚上我听到外面消防通道上有些动静
...one night I heard some noise on my fire escape...

349
00:19:59,315 --> 00:20:01,875
于是我打了911，最后警察终于来了
...so I called 9, and the cops came eventually.

350
00:20:02,084 --> 00:20:05,576
- 大概三小时以后吧 - 是啊，那时候我已经被先奸后杀了
- Like three hours later. - Yeah, after I had been raped and killed.

351
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:08,679
没有啦，来的只是一个男一女两个警察
No, but it was a man and a woman officer.

352
00:20:08,924 --> 00:20:10,915
当那个女警到楼下挪警车的时候
I was explaining what I had heard...

353
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,425
我向他解释我听到的声音
...when the woman had to go move the police car.

354
00:20:13,596 --> 00:20:15,291
那时只有那个男警察和我一起
I was left alone with the male cop.

355
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:19,924
而他立刻问我是不是有枪... 我说没有，我当然没有了
Right away he asked me if I had a gun, and I said, "No, of course not. "

356
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:23,003
然后他对我说：“是吗，你最好考虑去买一把”
And he told me, "Well, you better think about getting one.

357
00:20:23,205 --> 00:20:26,538
“这里是美国，不是法国”
This is America, not France. Okay?"

358
00:20:26,709 --> 00:20:29,837
然后我对他说，我完全不懂怎么开枪
And I said to him, "I have no idea how to shoot a gun...

359
00:20:30,045 --> 00:20:32,536
而且，我对枪支也没有兴趣
...and I have no interest in firearms whatsoever. "

360
00:20:32,782 --> 00:20:36,548
于是他抽出他的枪， 就像这样，然后他说：
And that's when he pulled out his gun, like this, and he went:

361
00:20:36,786 --> 00:20:42,224
“总有一天，你会碰到这么个东西指着你的脸”
"Well, one day, you're gonna have something like this in your face...

362
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,823
“如果你想活的长久点”
...and if you wanna have a long life...

363
00:20:45,428 --> 00:20:49,194
“你就必须决定是不是要干掉他们”
...you're gonna have to choose between you or them. "

364
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:54,668
然后他们就走了，而第二天早上， 我就打电话申请持有枪支
And then they left. And the next morning I called for an application to get a gun.

365
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,361
让我拿把枪！我是说， 那可真可怕...
Me with a gun. I mean, that's really scary.

366
00:20:57,573 --> 00:20:59,700
但是然后我意识到有些事不对劲
But then I realized something was wrong.

367
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:03,469
那警察拔枪的举动，还有其他的事...
The way that cop had pulled his gun out, and everything, right?

368
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,510
于是我取消了对枪的预订
So I canceled my demand for the gun...

369
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,809
然后我打电话给警察局， 想要对那个警察的行为进行申诉，但是...
...and I called the police and tried to complain about that cop.

370
00:21:08,984 --> 00:21:11,544
- 发生什么事了？ - 要填太多表了
- What happened with that? - It was so much paperwork...

371
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,553
然后我就怕了，就凭我这种学生签证...
...and then I got scared, with my shitty student visa...

372
00:21:14,723 --> 00:21:17,157
- 你认为你会被遣送出境 - 没错！于是我放弃了...
- Thought you'd get deported? - Exactly. I gave up...

373
00:21:17,326 --> 00:21:19,089
然后就忘记了整件事
...and forgot about the whole thing.

374
00:21:19,328 --> 00:21:22,889
- 其实，我想我永远也不会忘记的 - 当然了
- Well, I guess I never forgot. - Obviously.

375
00:21:23,098 --> 00:21:25,658
但是，我真的还是喜欢在那里的日子
But still, you know, I really enjoyed being there.

376
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,996
- 我怀念美国的很多事 - 是吗，比如？
- There's lots of things I miss in the U. S. - Yeah? Like what?

377
00:21:30,973 --> 00:21:32,531
恩...
Well...

378
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:35,232
那里的人们通常都有好心情
The overall good mood people have there.

379
00:21:35,478 --> 00:21:37,537
比如，你知道的，即使 有的时候胡乱问候
Like, even if it can be bullshit sometimes.

380
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,511
比如“你好吗？”“很好！” “你好吗？”“很好！”
Like, "How you doing?" "Great. " "How you doing?" "Great!"

381
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,043
“祝你今天愉快！”
"Have a great day!"

382
00:21:43,486 --> 00:21:47,081
我也不知道，巴黎人的脾气可不好，你发现了吗？
I don't know. Parisians can be so grumpy. Have you noticed?

383
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:49,917
没有啊，每个人在我看来都很高兴啊
No, everybody seems pretty happy to me.

384
00:21:50,626 --> 00:21:53,561
- 他们总是不高兴... - 他们总是不高兴？
- They're not happy. No. - They're not happy?

385
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:57,096
不是，他们也高兴，我不知道 我说的只是法国男人，他们快把我逼疯了！
No, they are. I don't know. I just mean French men. They drive me nuts.

386
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:58,698
怎么回事？他们怎么了？
What is it? What about them?

387
00:21:59,034 --> 00:22:02,026
恩，他们很好，不深入接触的话非常好
Well, they're very nice. They're great, you know, to be around.

388
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,229
他们喜欢食物，酒 他们做东西很好吃...
They love food, wine, they're great cooks.

389
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,397
但是，不知道，可能我只是运气不好
But I've had really bad luck with them.

390
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,202
怎么这么说？什么意思？
Why? What do you mean?

391
00:22:09,044 --> 00:22:12,036
- 我想他们不是那么... - 怎么？
- Well, I guess they're not as... - What?

392
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:13,806
怎么说呢
What's the word?

393
00:22:14,884 --> 00:22:18,149
- 好色？他们不那么好色... - 好色？
- Horny? They're not as horny. - Horny?

394
00:22:18,387 --> 00:22:22,653
等等，听我这么说怎样， 对此，我以身为美国人而骄傲
Wait, listen to me on this one. In that regard, I am proud to be an American.

395
00:22:22,825 --> 00:22:24,361
你确实应该如此，仅对此一点
And you should be. In that regard only.

396
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:25,900
（法语）谢谢
Have you ever spent time in Eastern Europe?

397
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:27,919
你去过东欧吗？

398
00:22:28,397 --> 00:22:30,888
东欧？没，没有... 谢谢
Eastern... No, I don't. Thank you.

399
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:34,494
我记得当我十多岁的时候我去过华沙
I remember as a teenager I went to Warsaw...

400
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:37,230
那时它还是共产主义的那一套
...when it was still a strict communist regime.

401
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,805
- 对此我是一点也不支持 - 当然...
- Which I don't approve of at all. - Sure you don't.

402
00:22:40,042 --> 00:22:42,010
- 不是，我才没有... - 好啦，我只是开玩笑！
- No, I don't. - I'm just kidding.

403
00:22:42,177 --> 00:22:45,112
但是，不管怎样，我发现 待在那里是件很有意思的事
But anyway, something about being there was very interesting.

404
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:48,512
仅仅几个星期之后 我就有了改变
After a couple of weeks, something changed in me.

405
00:22:48,684 --> 00:22:51,847
那座城市又阴郁又灰暗...
The city was quite gloomy and gray...

406
00:22:52,054 --> 00:22:54,784
但是过了一阵以后，我头脑变的更清醒了
...but after a while, my brain seemed clearer.

407
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,618
我在日记上记录了更多的东西
I was writing more in my journal...

408
00:22:56,825 --> 00:22:59,988
- 很多我以前从来没有过的想法 - 共产主义的想法？
...ideas I'd never thought of before... - Communist ideas?

409
00:23:00,195 --> 00:23:02,356
- 听着，我可不是... - 对不起，我...
- Listen, I'm not... - I'm sorry, I...

410
00:23:02,598 --> 00:23:04,327
- 好吧 - 继续！
- Okay. - Go on.

411
00:23:04,567 --> 00:23:07,127
以后我要送你去俄国古拉格集中营
Okay. I'll send you to a gulag later.

412
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:10,761
只是，那花了我好一阵时间 才搞清楚为什么那里让人感觉那么不同
No. But it took me a while to figure out why I felt so different.

413
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,602
然后有一天，当我穿过一个犹太墓地的时候
One day, as I was walking through the Jewish cemetery...

414
00:23:13,776 --> 00:23:15,676
我没想通为什么，但是我真的有所改变
...I don't know why, but it occurred to me there...

415
00:23:15,844 --> 00:23:19,712
我意识到过去的两个星期中 我改掉了以前的大多数习惯
...I realized that I had spent the last two weeks away from most of my habits.

416
00:23:19,882 --> 00:23:21,873
电视里说的是我听不懂的语言
TV was in a language I didn't understand...

417
00:23:22,084 --> 00:23:24,814
没什么好买的，也没什么广告
...there was nothing to buy, no advertisements anywhere...

418
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:26,614
所以，我能做的只有...
...so all I'd been doing was...

419
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:31,522
到处逛，思考，然后写下来 我的大脑好像在休息
...walk around, think, and write. My brain felt like it was at rest...

420
00:23:31,727 --> 00:23:35,322
没有了那种强烈的情绪 就好像是自然的高潮一样
...free from the consuming frenzy. It was almost like a natural high.

421
00:23:35,531 --> 00:23:40,093
我感觉内心格外平和 没有什么奇怪的冲动要去什么地方
I felt so peaceful inside. No strange urge to be somewhere else...

422
00:23:40,302 --> 00:23:41,633
购物什么的
...to shop...

423
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,964
一开始这样可能看起来很无聊
It could have seemed like boredom at first...

424
00:23:44,139 --> 00:23:45,902
但是很快这就让人感到内心非常非常的充实
...but it became very, very soulful.

425
00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:48,467
非常有意思，你知道吗？
It was interesting, you know?

426
00:23:48,644 --> 00:23:51,977
你能相信我们上一次漫步在维也纳是9年前的事吗？
Can you believe it was nine years ago we were walking around Vienna?

427
00:23:52,481 --> 00:23:56,178
- 九年？真难以想象 - 对我来说就好像是两个月之前的事
- Nine years? No, that's impossible. - No, it was. It feels like two months.

428
00:23:56,385 --> 00:23:58,319
但是那是94年夏天了
But it was summer '94.

429
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,820
我看起来有什么不同吗？
Do I look any different?

430
00:24:04,393 --> 00:24:06,122
有？
I do?

431
00:24:06,895 --> 00:24:08,157
我得看你一丝不挂的样子才知道
I'd have to see you naked.

432
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,498
- 什么？ - 对不起...
- What? - I know, I'm sorry.

433
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,065
你的发型变了，那时...
Your hair was different back then. It was like...

434
00:24:13,235 --> 00:24:15,669
- 什么，一样的啊... - 把头发放下来，让我看看！
- It's the same... Oh, down. - Yeah, take it down.

435
00:24:15,838 --> 00:24:17,567
放下来，好吧，放下来了
Down. Okay, it was down. Okay.

436
00:24:17,773 --> 00:24:19,934
好了
Well? Voil?

437
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,699
怎么样？
So?

438
00:24:23,746 --> 00:24:25,907
快点，告诉我
Okay, come on. Tell me.

439
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:31,778
瘦了，我觉得，苗条了
Skinnier, I think. A little thinner.

440
00:24:32,855 --> 00:24:34,379
你觉得我以前很胖？
Did you think I was fat before?

441
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:37,525
- 不是 - 你肯定觉得我那时很胖
- No... - Yeah, you thought I was a fatty.

442
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:41,753
没错，你觉得我很胖， 你的书写的是个法国胖妞！
No, you thought I was a fatty. You wrote a book about a fat French girl.

443
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,864
- 哦，不要！ - 好啦，说真的
- No, listen. - Oh, no.

444
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:46,193
你看起来漂亮极了！
Seriously, all right? You look beautiful.

445
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,393
那你觉得我有什么变化吗？
Do I look any different?

446
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:52,264
没有什么...哦，事实上 你这多了道皱纹
No. Not at all. Actually, you have this line.

447
00:24:52,474 --> 00:24:54,908
- 我知道 - 看起来好像疤
- I know. - It's like a scar.

448
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:59,547
- 疤？看起来像被枪打得吧？ - 没有，没有，我挺喜欢的，对不起啦
- A scar? Like a gunshot wound? - No, no, no. I like it. I'm sorry.

449
00:25:00,883 --> 00:25:05,684
有天我做了个有趣的... 呃，不，恐怖的梦
I had this funny... Well, horrible dream the other day.

450
00:25:06,722 --> 00:25:10,749
我做恶梦，梦见我有32岁了
I was having this awful nightmare that I was 32.

451
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:14,123
然后当我醒来的时候，我才只有23！ 我就放心了...
And then I woke up, and I was 23. So relieved.

452
00:25:14,329 --> 00:25:16,923
但是后来我真的从梦里醒来， 发现我确实32了
And then I woke up for real, and I was 32.

453
00:25:17,132 --> 00:25:19,600
- 好可怕！ - 是会有这种事的
- Shit, man. It happens. - Scary.

454
00:25:19,802 --> 00:25:22,464
时间越走越快，看上去，是因为...
Time goes faster and faster. Apparently, it's because...

455
00:25:22,638 --> 00:25:26,096
从20岁以后我们身体里的神经键就不再更新了 于是，从那以后我们就开始走下坡路了
...we don't renew synapses after our 20s, so it's downhill from then on.

456
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:30,268
我喜欢变老，你懂吗，会感觉生活更...
I like getting older, you know? Life feels...

457
00:25:30,579 --> 00:25:34,106
我不知道，好像感觉更直接 好像我能欣赏更多东西了
I don't know, it feels more immediate. Like I can appreciate things more.

458
00:25:34,983 --> 00:25:37,577
其实我也一样，我很喜欢
No, me too, actually. I really love it.

459
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,817
我曾经是...
I was once...

460
00:25:40,022 --> 00:25:41,421
一个乐队里的鼓手
...a drummer in a band.

461
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,217
- 真的？ - 是啊，我们当时真的很棒
- You were? - Yeah. We were pretty good, actually.

462
00:25:44,426 --> 00:25:48,624
不过那个主唱，他整天就想着让我们能出唱片
But the lead-singer guy, he was just so obsessed with us getting a record deal.

463
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,766
我们整天谈的，想的 就是参加更大的演出
It's all we talked about, thought about, getting bigger shows.

464
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,459
每时每刻都是为了将来的发展，而现在...
Everything was just focused on the future all the time. And now...

465
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,502
...乐队却已经不存在了
...the band doesn't even exist anymore.

466
00:25:57,673 --> 00:26:00,039
现在回顾那些我们参加了的表演
And looking back at the shows we did play...

467
00:26:00,242 --> 00:26:03,143
甚至哪怕只是排练 都觉得那么有意思！
...even rehearsing, it was just so much fun.

468
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:07,510
现在我终于能享受那每一分钟了 我能抽一口吗？
I just... Now I'd enjoy every minute of it. Could I have a drag of that?

469
00:26:07,783 --> 00:26:10,809
你的书出版了，这事不算小了
Well, your book has been published. That's a pretty big deal.

470
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:14,284
而且你巡回了整个欧洲来卖它 你觉得能享受其中的每一分钟吗？
You've been all around Europe. Are you enjoying every minute of it?

471
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,855
- 不太行... - 不太行？
- Not really. - Not really?

472
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:18,458
不行
No.

473
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,656
- 你还有烟吗？ - 当然有
- Do you have another one of those? - Yes, of course.

474
00:26:23,766 --> 00:26:25,290
给你
Here.

475
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:29,296
在我这行里，我见到很多人... 哦，对不起...
In my field, I see these people that... Oh, sorry.

476
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:32,030
过于理想，好高骛远
Come into it with big, idealist visions...

477
00:26:32,207 --> 00:26:34,971
想要成为新的领袖， 来创建更美好的世界
...of becoming the leader that will create a better world.

478
00:26:35,144 --> 00:26:37,339
他们乐于见到目标被实现， 却对过程没兴趣！
They enjoy the goal, but not the process.

479
00:26:37,546 --> 00:26:39,411
- 是啊 - 但事实上...
- Right. - But the reality of it is...

480
00:26:39,581 --> 00:26:43,017
真正能改善世界的工作 是日复一日的点滴进步
...the true work of improving things is in the little achievements.

481
00:26:43,218 --> 00:26:46,187
- 这才是应该享受的事 - 你具体指什么呢？
- That's what you need to enjoy. - What do you mean, exactly?

482
00:26:46,388 --> 00:26:49,983
比如，我为一个组织工作 这个组织在墨西哥帮助那里的村民
I was working for this organization that helped villages in Mexico.

483
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:53,150
他们关心的是怎么把铅笔
And their concerns was how to get the pencils...

484
00:26:53,328 --> 00:26:55,728
送到那些乡村小学的孩子手中
...sent to the kid in those little country schools.

485
00:26:55,898 --> 00:26:59,732
那不是什么重大的革命性的想法 仅仅是铅笔而已！
It was not about big, revolutionary ideas. It was about pencils.

486
00:27:00,102 --> 00:27:03,560
我见到过那些做实事的人 很不幸的是...
I see the people that do the real work, and what's really sad is that...

487
00:27:03,939 --> 00:27:06,499
...那些最慷慨的，最勤劳的...
...the people that are the most giving, hardworking...

488
00:27:06,675 --> 00:27:08,870
...也是最能让这个世界变得更好的人...
...and capable of making this world better...

489
00:27:09,077 --> 00:27:12,205
...往往没什么野心 不想成为什么领袖
...usually don't have the ego and ambition to be a leader.

490
00:27:12,414 --> 00:27:15,042
他们对那些形式上的奖励没有兴趣
They don't see any interest in superficial rewards.

491
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:18,310
他们也不在乎自己的名字能不能上报纸
They don't care if their name ever appear in the press.

492
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,318
他们只是享受着帮助人的那种过程
They actually enjoy the process of helping others.

493
00:27:21,523 --> 00:27:24,219
- 他们自得其乐 - 是啊，不过那很难啊！
- They're in the moment. - Yeah, but that's so hard...

494
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:27,294
自得其乐，我是说，我感觉我好像...
...you know, to be in the moment. I mean, I feel like I'm...

495
00:27:27,462 --> 00:27:31,455
是被设计成那种对什么都不很满意的类型...
...designed to be slightly dissatisfied with everything, you know?

496
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:34,124
你懂吗，我是说，好像永远都 在试图改善自己的现状一样
It's like always trying to better my situation.

497
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:37,805
我满足了一种欲望 就会刺激另一种欲望，懂吗？
I satisfy one desire, and it just agitates another.

498
00:27:37,973 --> 00:27:41,534
然后我就想：都去他妈的吧 欲望是生活的动力
And then I think, to hell with it, right? Desire's the fuel of life.

499
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:44,543
你认为这是真的吗？
You know? Do you think it's true...

500
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:47,647
如果我们没有欲望，我们就会永远快乐？
...that if we never wanted anything, we'd never be unhappy?

501
00:27:47,883 --> 00:27:52,911
我不知道，没有欲望，这难道 不是抑郁症的一种表现吗？
I don't know. Not wanting anything, isn't that a symptom of depression?

502
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:56,717
没错，就是的，对吧？ 我是说，有欲望是种健康的表现，对吧？
Yeah, that is, right? I mean, it's healthy to desire, right?

503
00:27:56,925 --> 00:28:00,554
是啊，我不知道，不过那些佛教徒都那么说，对吧？
Yeah. I don't know. It's what all those Buddhist guys say, right?

504
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:03,128
从欲望中解脱出来，你就会发现...
Liberate yourself from desire, and you'll find...

505
00:28:03,298 --> 00:28:06,495
- 你已经拥有你需要的一切 - 是啊，不过当我想要拥有...
...you already have everything you need. - But I feel alive...

506
00:28:06,735 --> 00:28:09,499
那些不算基本生存需要的东西的时候 我能感觉到自己是真实存活的
...when I want something more than basic survival needs.

507
00:28:09,671 --> 00:28:12,504
我是说，不管哪种欲望，比如想和谁亲热
Wanting, whether it's intimacy with another person...

508
00:28:12,741 --> 00:28:14,470
或是想要双新鞋，都很美...
...or a pair of shoes, is beautiful.

509
00:28:14,676 --> 00:28:18,237
我喜欢我们拥有无止境的欲望
I like that we have those ever-renewing desires, you know?

510
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:20,142
也许那是一种有权享用的感觉
Maybe it's this sense of entitlement.

511
00:28:20,382 --> 00:28:24,113
你懂吗，好像什么时候你觉得你配穿双新鞋
You know, like whenever you feel like you deserve that new pair of shoes?

512
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:28,187
欲望本身不是坏事，只要你不要 太在意得失就好
It's okay to want things, as long as you aren't pissed off if you don't get them.

513
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,255
生活很辛苦，这也是顺理成章的事
Life's hard. It's supposed to be.

514
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,451
吃一堑，长一智，对吗？
If we didn't suffer, we wouldn't learn a thing, you know?

515
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,764
那，你是佛教徒吗？
So, what, are you Buddhist, or something?

516
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,461
- 不是 - 不是？为什么不是？
- No. - No? Why not?

517
00:28:40,903 --> 00:28:45,636
我不知道，出于同一原因， 我不会让自己完全相信任何信仰
I don't know. The same reason I don't really consider myself anything, really.

518
00:28:46,008 --> 00:28:49,444
很久前我就决定 我可以接受任何信念...
I decided a long time ago that I was gonna be open to everything...

519
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:52,136
但是不会执迷于一种信仰
...but not buy into any one and only belief system.

520
00:28:53,782 --> 00:28:56,910
数年前，我曾经去过一所苦修派修道院
I went to this Trappist monastery a couple years ago.

521
00:28:57,486 --> 00:29:01,354
- 苦修派？ - 是的，天主教西多教派的
- Trappist? - Yeah, they're Catholic. Cistercian.

522
00:29:01,623 --> 00:29:05,218
- 你为什么要去那 - 为什么？可能就是去读些书吧
- Why did you do that? - Why? I'd been doing some reading.

523
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:09,294
我觉得那很酷，你曾经和修士和修女生活在一起过吗？
Thought it'd be cool. Have you ever spent any time with monks or nuns?

524
00:29:09,631 --> 00:29:12,964
- 没有，我可不想那样 - 没有？
- No. It's not really my style. - No?

525
00:29:13,735 --> 00:29:17,796
我本来以为他们都是神情肃穆 严厉苛刻的，但是他们不是
Well, I expected them to be all glowering and stern, but they weren't.

526
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,566
他们很容易就笑，非常好相处
They were quick to laugh, really easy to be around.

527
00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:23,801
真的，他们对一切都不排斥 他们只是...
Seriously, very attuned to everything, they were just...

528
00:29:24,046 --> 00:29:26,480
你懂吗，他们不会打扰任何人
You know, they weren't trying to hustle anybody.

529
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,173
他们只是想平静的信奉天主 生存，然后死去
They're trying to live and die in peace with God...

530
00:29:29,384 --> 00:29:31,875
也或者他们信奉的是其他什么 他们觉得永恒的东西
...or whatever part of them they feel is eternal.

531
00:29:32,087 --> 00:29:34,055
但是身处其间真的很舒服
It was just so refreshing to be around.

532
00:29:34,222 --> 00:29:36,713
你懂吗，你会发现你遇到的绝大多数人
You realize that most of the people that you meet...

533
00:29:36,892 --> 00:29:38,689
都是想要过的更好
...are trying to get somewhere better.

534
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:42,057
赚更多的钱啦 赢得更多的尊敬啊，
They're trying to make more cash, get a little more respect...

535
00:29:42,264 --> 00:29:44,698
让人们崇拜自己啊之类的 太累了！
...have more people admire them. It's exhausting.

536
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,028
- 没错 - 要是你自己也成为这样的人，真是太累了
- No kidding. - And it's exhausting to be one yourself.

537
00:29:48,236 --> 00:29:51,603
我是说，我就是这样的，精神上很贪婪
There I am, right, you know, all greedy to be more spiritual.

538
00:29:51,773 --> 00:29:55,368
我想变得更好，懂吗，这是你逃不脱的！
"I want to be a better person," you know? You can't escape.

539
00:29:55,544 --> 00:30:01,710
好多年前，我有个男友想做佛教徒
I had this boyfriend of mine many years ago that wanted to be a Buddhist.

540
00:30:02,084 --> 00:30:04,609
然后他去了亚洲，去瞻仰那里的寺院
So he went to Asia to visit some of those monasteries.

541
00:30:04,853 --> 00:30:08,550
- 是啊，我也想过去那些地方 - 那你应该去，我告诉你为什么
- I've thought about doing that too. - Yeah, you should. I'll tell you why.

542
00:30:08,757 --> 00:30:12,124
啊，他长得很帅 每次他去那些寺院的时候
He was good-looking, and each time he went to one of the monasteries...

543
00:30:12,294 --> 00:30:14,922
都会有僧侣愿意替他口交
...a monk offered to suck his cock.

544
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,859
真的
True story.

545
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:20,234
好吧，最后都会变成这样，对吧？
It all comes down to that, doesn't it?

546
00:30:20,435 --> 00:30:22,596
我是说，这就是为什么我很崇拜你做的事
That's why I really admire what you're doing.

547
00:30:22,804 --> 00:30:24,931
你什么意思，口交？
- You know? - What do you mean? Sucking cock?

548
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,303
- 啊，不... - 不是？我猜错了？
- No. - No? Wrong answer.

549
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:32,276
不是，我想说的是，你不是那种超然的人
No, I was gonna say you're not detached from life.

550
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:34,914
你做事很有激情
You're putting your passion into action.

551
00:30:35,117 --> 00:30:37,779
这个嘛，起码我努力这样做
Well, I try.

552
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,787
你知道吗，我接下来8个小时会在机场
You know something? I'm gonna be on planes...

553
00:30:41,957 --> 00:30:44,289
以及飞机上度过
...and in an airport for the next eight hours...

554
00:30:44,526 --> 00:30:46,892
我很想再看看巴黎
I'd just love to see a little bit more of Paris.

555
00:30:47,162 --> 00:30:48,629
- 我们能出去走走... - 好啊，好啊，我们走吧！
- Would you walk with me? - Yeah.

556
00:30:48,797 --> 00:30:50,128
- 你介意吗？ - 怎么会呢，很好啊！
- Do you mind? - That's great.

557
00:30:50,332 --> 00:30:52,266
- 你想去吗？ - 当然！
- Do you want to? - Let's do that. Yeah.

558
00:30:52,467 --> 00:30:54,298
我们该付多少？4块5...
What do we owe here? Four-fifty?

559
00:30:54,536 --> 00:30:57,061
不用，不用，我有，我有
No, I got it, I got a little per diem going on here.

560
00:30:57,239 --> 00:30:59,469
- 这够付小费的了吗？ - 恩，够了
- This good, for a tip? - Yeah, that's fine.

561
00:30:59,674 --> 00:31:02,040
- 只多不少！ - 这个也留下吧
- That's more than enough. - Throw that in too.

562
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:05,769
- 好啦，周围有什么值得逛的吗？ - 今天是减价日！
- Is there anywhere to go around here? - It's sales day today.

563
00:31:05,981 --> 00:31:08,916
- 什么意思？ - 今天巴黎什么东西都会减价
- What's that? - It's when everything's on sale in Paris.

564
00:31:09,418 --> 00:31:10,474
每年两次
It's twice a year.

565
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,000
（法语）再见，谢谢

566
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,300
（法语）再见
All right, let's go shopping.

567
00:31:13,321 --> 00:31:14,982
好啊，那我们去购物吧！

568
00:31:15,157 --> 00:31:18,285
不，不，这主意不好 我不想让你这样
No, no, no. That's a bad idea. I don't wanna inflict that on you.

569
00:31:18,493 --> 00:31:22,429
那简直疯了，我们就去那个 花园逛逛吧，那真的不错的
It's madness. Let's just go to this garden path. It's really nice.

570
00:31:22,731 --> 00:31:25,165
好啊，听起来其实比购物要好
All right. That sounds better than shopping, actually.

571
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:27,460
我是说，我并不是不想陪你做你喜欢的事
Not that I wouldn't do whatever you wanted.

572
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:30,628
其实有的时候我也不是需要什么东西
Sometimes I don't even need to buy anything. I just get high...

573
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:32,603
我只是想试穿，还有看那些商品， 这让我很兴奋
...on trying on and looking at things.

574
00:31:32,774 --> 00:31:34,537
这个嘛，苦修派僧侣会对你说... 我们往这边走？
Is this where we're going?

575
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:36,973
- 是的！ - 苦修派僧侣会对你说这很好
- Yeah. - A therapist will tell you that's good.

576
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,511
- 真的？ 你节食过吗？ - 没有！
- Really? Are you ever in therapy? - Oh, no.

577
00:31:39,714 --> 00:31:42,774
- 我看起来像在节食吗？ - 我只是开玩笑
- Do I seem like I'm in therapy? - I'm kidding.

578
00:31:43,185 --> 00:31:47,019
- 这对你的性障碍有帮助吗？ - 我的性障碍？
- Does it help your sex problems? - My sex problems?

579
00:31:47,189 --> 00:31:48,713
- 没有啦，我只是开玩笑 - 比如呢？跟我说实话
- I'm kidding. - Tell me the truth.

580
00:31:48,957 --> 00:31:51,187
- 那天晚上我们不是挺好的？ - 不，我是在开玩笑
- We didn't have any problems. - No, I'm kidding.

581
00:31:51,393 --> 00:31:53,861
- 我们根本就没有做爱 - 这是个玩笑，对吧？
- We didn't even have sex. - That's a joke, right?

582
00:31:54,096 --> 00:31:56,724
不是，我们确实没做爱！ 就是这么回事
No, we didn't. I mean, that was the whole thing.

583
00:31:56,898 --> 00:31:58,957
- 可我们确实做了啊！ - 没有，没有，我们没做！
- Of course we did. - No, no, no, we didn't.

584
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,965
你没有安全套， 而我没有安全套从来不做爱
You didn't have a condom and I never have sex without one.

585
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,035
尤其是一夜情那种，我是说， 我对于自己的健康非常在意，我不可能...
I'm extremely paranoid. There's no way...

586
00:32:04,239 --> 00:32:06,799
我觉得这太可怕了， 你竟然不记得我们之间发生过什么
I find it scary that you don't remember what happened.

587
00:32:06,975 --> 00:32:08,340
不，听我说
No, listen...

588
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,206
...我从来没写过一整本书 但是我记日记...
...I didn't write an entire book, but I kept a journal...

589
00:32:11,413 --> 00:32:12,467
我在里面记下了整晚发生的事
...and I wrote the whole night in it. That's what I meant, you idealizing it.

590
00:32:12,468 --> 00:32:15,334
这就是我的意思，你对 那夜进行了理想化的加工！

591
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:18,815
好啦，听我说！我甚至记得 我们用过的安全套是什么牌子的
All right, listen, I even remember what brand of condom we used.

592
00:32:18,987 --> 00:32:20,887
好啦，这太恶心啦，我不想听！
That's disgusting. I don't wanna hear it.

593
00:32:21,056 --> 00:32:23,616
- 这有什么恶心的... - 没有啦
- That's not disgusting. - No.

594
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:28,353
好啦，等我回家，我会查我94年的日记 不过我知道我是对的！
Okay, when I get home I'll check my journal from '94, but I know I'm right.

595
00:32:31,233 --> 00:32:33,167
- 等等... - 怎么了？
- Wait a minute. - What?

596
00:32:33,335 --> 00:32:36,065
- 那是在一个墓地发生的吗？ - 不是...
- Was it in the cemetery? - No.

597
00:32:36,271 --> 00:32:38,671
不是的，我们是下午去那个墓地的
No, we went to the cemetery in the afternoon.

598
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,741
应该是在一个公园里，深夜时分
It was in the park, very late at night.

599
00:32:42,144 --> 00:32:44,271
- 在公园里！ - 等等...
- In the park? - Wait a minute, wait a minute.

600
00:32:44,446 --> 00:32:46,277
我真不能...我没法...
I can't... I can't...

601
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:50,514
这事这么容易忘记吗？ 你真的不记得了？在公园里！
Is it that forgettable? You really don't remember? In the park?

602
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:53,552
好的，等等 我想你可能是对的...
Okay. Wait a minute, I think you might be right...

603
00:32:53,755 --> 00:32:55,086
行啦，你在和我胡扯是不是
You're messing with me now.

604
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,689
- 没有 - 你在和我胡扯吗？
- No. - Are you messing with me?

605
00:32:56,892 --> 00:33:00,055
不是的，对不起！我觉得你... 我是说，你是对的，这样可以了吧？
Okay. No, I'm sorry. I think... I mean, you're right, okay?

606
00:33:00,262 --> 00:33:03,720
有时我就是忘事
Sometimes I put things in drawers inside my head and forget about it.

607
00:33:03,932 --> 00:33:06,594
我想有时忘记会让人少些痛苦！
It's less painful to put things away than live with it.

608
00:33:06,801 --> 00:33:09,531
什么，就是说那夜对你来说是段很难过的回忆罗？
What, so that night was, like, a sad memory for you?

609
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:11,569
不，我不是针对那一夜
I didn't mean that night in particular.

610
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,799
我只是说有些事情还是忘了好
I meant certain things are better forgotten.

611
00:33:14,042 --> 00:33:16,533
那夜是我那一整年记的最清楚的一天
I remember that night better than I do entire years.

612
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,542
- 我也是 - 真的吗？
- Me too. - Really?

613
00:33:18,713 --> 00:33:20,874
呃，我觉得我是...
Well, I thought I did.

614
00:33:23,485 --> 00:33:27,148
不过，可能我...可能我忘记那事是因为...
But maybe I... Maybe I put it away because of the fact that...

615
00:33:27,322 --> 00:33:30,450
...我祖母葬礼的那天 就是我们约好再见的那天
...my grandmother's funeral was the day we were supposed to meet.

616
00:33:30,692 --> 00:33:33,627
对我来说那天挺难熬 不过对你来说大概更糟
It was a tough day for me, but it must've been worse for you.

617
00:33:33,828 --> 00:33:38,424
感觉好像不真实，我还记得我看见她的遗体躺在棺材里
It was unreal. I remember looking at her dead body in the coffin...

618
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,969
她曾经总是用她美丽的手抱着我 那么温暖，那么亲切...
...at her beautiful hands, so warm, so sweet, that used to hold me...

619
00:33:43,471 --> 00:33:46,770
但是棺材里的她 和我记忆中的一点都不一样
...but nothing in that coffin resembled what I remembered of her.

620
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,500
所有的温暖都消逝了
All the warmth was gone.

621
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:51,575
然后我开始哭... 我感觉很困惑，不知道
And then I was crying, so confused if I was crying...

622
00:33:51,746 --> 00:33:57,309
我哭是因为不能再见到她了 还是因为不能再见到你了
...because I was never gonna see her again or never gonna see you again...

623
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,353
对不起， 我竟然变成这样 这个星期我情绪都有点低落，我不知道...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry to go on like this. I've been a little down this week.

624
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:04,582
- 为什么？ - 我不知道，没什么，只是...
- Why? - I don't know. Nothing bad, just...

625
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:06,761
可能是因为读了你的书？
Reading your book, maybe?

626
00:34:06,928 --> 00:34:10,796
也不是，不过...想想那个夏天和秋天， 我充满了希望
No, but... Thinking of how hopeful I was that summer and fall...

627
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:13,229
而自从那以后，好像就有点...
...and since then it's been kind of a...

628
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,201
我也不知道
I don't know.

629
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:19,534
回忆本来是非常美好的 只要你能让过去的都过去
Memory is a wonderful thing if you don't have to deal with the past.

630
00:34:22,277 --> 00:34:25,110
回忆本来是非常美好的 只要你能让过去的都过去
"Memory is wonderful if you don't have to deal with the past. "

631
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,941
我能把这话贴到我车牌上吗？
Can I put that on a bumper sticker?

632
00:34:27,115 --> 00:34:29,811
你知道吗？要是你写一本关于我们的一夜情的书 这是个不错的书名！
If you wrote a book about our night, that's a good title.

633
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:33,853
- 可能会是本完全不同的书 - 是啊，不会涉及色情
- And it could be a total different book. - Yeah, there'd be no sex scenes.

634
00:34:34,456 --> 00:34:35,787
- 不过你知道吗？ - 恩？
- But you know what? - What?

635
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,356
既然现在我们又见面了
Now that we've met again...

636
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:40,187
我们可以改变我们那个12月16日的回忆
...we can change our memory of that December 6.

637
00:34:40,362 --> 00:34:43,798
那回忆将不再有是以悲剧结尾了， 因为我们又见面了
It no longer has that sad ending of us never seeing each other again.

638
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:48,459
没错，我想回忆永远可以更改 只要你还活着...
Right. I mean, I guess a memory's never finished as long as you're alive.

639
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:52,265
是啊，我知道，我有一段童年的回忆
Yeah, I know. I have this memory from my childhood...

640
00:34:52,474 --> 00:34:55,034
- 但是我最近意识到，这段回忆其实从未发生过 - 是什么？
...I realized recently never happened. - What?

641
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:58,179
这个，当我八九岁的时候 我妈妈很担心
Well, when I was 8 or 9, my mom was so paranoid...

642
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:01,213
...怕我上完钢琴课以后 一个人走回家会出事...
...when I was walking home from my piano lesson at night...

643
00:35:01,383 --> 00:35:04,079
...她总是让我当心 色迷迷的的老头给我糖果...
...she'd warn me about dirty old men giving me candies...

644
00:35:04,286 --> 00:35:06,083
...然后给我看他们的鸡鸡
...and then showing me their pee-pees.

645
00:35:06,288 --> 00:35:09,348
她总是这么说 然后后来，你懂吗，我...
She was so obsessed with it that, later in life, you know...

646
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,925
...我头脑中就真的觉得这曾经发生过！
...I had this image in my head that this really happened.

647
00:35:13,094 --> 00:35:16,655
我甚至把做爱和回家联系到一起了
To the point that I even associated sex with that walk home.

648
00:35:16,831 --> 00:35:20,528
我是说，有时候，甚至是现在，当我...
I mean, and sometimes, even now, when I'm...

649
00:35:21,403 --> 00:35:25,362
当我做爱的时候，我都好像 看见我自己在那街上走
When I'm having sex, I see myself walking down that street.

650
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,440
我发誓！非常奇怪，对吧？
I swear. It's so weird, right?

651
00:35:27,609 --> 00:35:31,841
- 呃，那条街离这近吗？我是说，能... - 不行
- Is that street nearby? I mean, could...? - Could we? No.

652
00:35:32,013 --> 00:35:34,208
非常远
Very far.

653
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,908
你小的时候记日记吗？
Did you ever keep a journal when you were a kid?

654
00:35:38,086 --> 00:35:41,419
恩，算是吧，有时记
Yeah. On and off, I guess.

655
00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:43,750
很有意思的是，我有天读了...
It's funny, I read one of mine...

656
00:35:43,925 --> 00:35:45,825
- 我83年的一本日记 - 怎么了
...from '83 the other day. - Yeah?

657
00:35:46,127 --> 00:35:47,788
让我惊奇的是
And what really surprised me is...

658
00:35:47,962 --> 00:35:50,897
我那时的人生观和现在一样
...that I was dealing with life the same way I am now.

659
00:35:51,099 --> 00:35:53,090
当然我那时更天真，更充满希望
I was much more hopeful and naive...

660
00:35:53,268 --> 00:35:57,568
...不过内心深处对事情的感觉是完全一样的！
...but the core, and the way I was feeling things, is exactly the same.

661
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:00,071
这让我意识到我其实没怎么变
It made me realize I haven't changed much at all.

662
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,731
是啊，谁不是这样的呢？
I don't think anybody does.

663
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:05,710
尽管人们都不愿意承认，但事实上我们... 我们很多个性都是天生的
People don't want to admit it, but it's like we have these innate set points...

664
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,475
很少有什么后天发生的事 能改变我们的性情
...and nothing much that happens to us changes our disposition.

665
00:36:09,651 --> 00:36:11,118
- 你是这么想的？ - 是的
- You believe that? - I think so.

666
00:36:11,286 --> 00:36:14,619
我曾经读过一些研究报告 是关于那些赢了彩票的人...
I read this study where they followed people who'd won the lottery...

667
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:16,654
...和截瘫的人的心态
...and people who'd become paraplegics.

668
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:20,988
你会认为前一件事能让你欣喜若狂， 后一件则让你简直想自杀
You'd think one extreme is gonna make you euphoric and the other suicidal.

669
00:36:21,162 --> 00:36:23,892
但是研究却表明，大概六个月之后
But the study shows that, after about six months...

670
00:36:24,065 --> 00:36:27,330
只要人们习惯了他们的新处境
...as soon as people had gotten used to their new situation...

671
00:36:27,502 --> 00:36:29,834
- 他们就和以前差不多一样了 - 一样？
...they were, more or less, the same. - The same?

672
00:36:30,004 --> 00:36:33,235
恩，是的，如果他们本质上是乐观开朗的人
Yeah. Like, if they were basically an optimistic, jovial person...

673
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:36,241
即使他们现在坐在了轮椅上，他们还是乐天派
...they're now an optimistic, jovial person in a wheelchair.

674
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,412
如果他们是见识短浅的笨家伙
If they're a petty, miserable asshole...

675
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:42,516
就算他们有了卡迪拉克轿车，大房子 游艇，他们还是见识短浅的笨蛋
...they're a petty, miserable asshole with a new Cadillac, a house and a boat.

676
00:36:42,684 --> 00:36:46,017
就是说，哪怕有再多的幸运降临 他们还是难以得到满足？
So I'll be forever depressed no matter what great things happen?

677
00:36:46,187 --> 00:36:47,586
- 没错！ - 好吧
- Definitely. - Great.

678
00:36:47,756 --> 00:36:49,451
别开玩笑了，你现在郁闷吗？
No, come on, are you depressed now?

679
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,922
不，不，我不郁闷
No, no, I'm not depressed.

680
00:36:52,093 --> 00:36:54,755
不过有的时候我会担心 当我走到生命尽头的时候...
But sometimes I worry I'll get to the end of my life...

681
00:36:54,929 --> 00:36:58,456
-...我会发现我想要做的事还没都做过 - 哦，那你想要做什么？
...feeling I haven't done all I wanted to. - Well, what do you want to do?

682
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,328
我....
I...

683
00:37:00,502 --> 00:37:03,528
我想画更多的画 我想每天弹吉他
I want to paint more, I want to play my guitar every day.

684
00:37:03,705 --> 00:37:06,936
我想学中文 我想写更多的歌...
I want to learn Chinese. I want to write more songs.

685
00:37:07,108 --> 00:37:11,442
我想做的事太多了 但是最后却只干了没多少
There's so many things I want to do, and I end up doing not much.

686
00:37:12,347 --> 00:37:18,183
好吧，那，让我问你这个问题： 你相信，恩，比如鬼或者灵魂什么的吗？
All right, well, let me ask you this: Do you believe in ghosts or spirits?

687
00:37:18,353 --> 00:37:19,718
呃，不信
No.

688
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:21,218
- 不信？ - 不信
- No? - No.

689
00:37:21,423 --> 00:37:25,154
- 好，那投胎呢？ - 一点不信
- Okay, what about reincarnation? - Not at all.

690
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,294
- 上帝呢？ - 不信
- God? - No.

691
00:37:27,462 --> 00:37:29,953
- 好吧 - 听起来挺惨的吧
- All right. - That sounds terrible. No, no, no.

692
00:37:30,131 --> 00:37:34,033
不过，同时呢，我不想变成那种不相信任何魔力的人
But I don't want to be one of those people that don't believe in any magic.

693
00:37:34,202 --> 00:37:36,136
- 你相信占星术 - 没错！
- So then, astrology? - Yes, of course!

694
00:37:36,304 --> 00:37:38,135
- 总算找到一样了 - 我是说，这很有道理，对吧？
- There we go. - That makes sense, right?

695
00:37:38,306 --> 00:37:41,707
你是天蝎，我是射手，所以我们合得来
You're a Scorpio, I'm a Sag, we get along.

696
00:37:42,644 --> 00:37:44,475
没有啦
No, no, no.

697
00:37:44,646 --> 00:37:47,672
爱因斯坦说过一段话，我真的很喜欢
There's an Einstein quote I really, really like.

698
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:51,341
他说：“如果你不相信任何魔法和神话的话
He said, "If you don't believe in any kind of magic or mystery

699
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,352
- 那你就和死人差不多了” - 是啊，我也喜欢这话
you're basically as good as dead. " - Yeah, I like that.

700
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,855
我总是觉得茫茫宇宙中有些神秘的和谐
I've always felt there was some kind of mystical core to the universe.

701
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:03,225
最近我在想有关我啊，我的性格之类的
But, more recently, I've started to think that, me, my personality, whatever...

702
00:38:03,398 --> 00:38:06,492
我不能永远待在这里
That I don't have any permanent place here, you know.

703
00:38:06,668 --> 00:38:08,329
我们不会长生不老
In eternity or whatever, you know.

704
00:38:08,503 --> 00:38:12,337
我越想到这个，就越觉得不能浪费人生
And the more I think that, I can't go through life saying this is no big deal.

705
00:38:12,507 --> 00:38:15,999
因为生命仅此一次 任何事情，不管是有趣的
This is it. This is actually happening. What do you think is interesting?

706
00:38:16,177 --> 00:38:18,338
还是好笑的 或者是重要的
What do you think is funny? What is important?

707
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,844
懂吗，每天都有可能是我们的最后一天
You know, every day's our last.

708
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:24,708
我一想到这个，我就会打电话给我的妈妈说我有多爱她
When I feel that way, I usually call my mom to tell her I love her.

709
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:26,513
- 是吗 - 然后她就总问
- Yeah? - And she's always:

710
00:38:26,688 --> 00:38:30,784
“你还好吧”“你不会得了癌症吧？ 你会去自杀吗？”
"Are you okay? Do you have cancer? Are you gonna commit suicide?"

711
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:33,586
不至于吧
It's almost not worth it.

712
00:38:34,796 --> 00:38:37,594
那我们呢
So, what about us?

713
00:38:37,765 --> 00:38:40,290
- 我们？ - 我是说
- What about us? - No, what I mean is...

714
00:38:40,502 --> 00:38:44,063
- 如果我们今晚就要死了 - 你是说世界末日来临？
...if we were both going to die tonight... - Like the apocalypse was coming?

715
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:48,369
不，没有那么恐怖 ，不过， 如果只有我们两个要死了
No, that's too dramatic... But what if just the two of us were going to die?

716
00:38:48,543 --> 00:38:50,477
我们还会谈论你的书吗？
I mean, would we talk about your book?

717
00:38:50,645 --> 00:38:53,409
- 或者环境问题吗？ - 如果今天是我们的最后一天？
- The environment? Or... - If today was our last day?

718
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,209
没错，我们会谈什么，你会跟我说什么？
Yeah, what would we talk about? What would you tell me?

719
00:38:56,384 --> 00:38:57,908
- 恩 - 很难回答？
- Well... - That's hard, huh?

720
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,417
- 不不，我在想呢 - 好吧
- No, no, I'll do it. - Okay.

721
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:02,055
我一定不会再讨论我的书了
I definitely would stop talking about my book.

722
00:39:02,223 --> 00:39:04,885
- 我得承认我大概也不会谈环境问题了 - 好
- I would probably drop the environment. - Okay.

723
00:39:05,059 --> 00:39:08,995
不过我仍然想要谈谈 那些魔法啊，宇宙什么的
But I would still want to talk about, you know, the magic in the universe.

724
00:39:09,163 --> 00:39:12,394
- 只是我希望做这些的时候我是在一个...． - 什么？
- I'd just want to do it from a... - What?

725
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:14,159
...一个旅馆房间里...
...a hotel room, you know...

726
00:39:14,335 --> 00:39:18,135
...在我们每个疯狂做爱的间隙 直到我们死去
...in between sessions of us wildly fucking until we die.

727
00:39:18,306 --> 00:39:21,139
哇！何必要浪费时间去旅馆呢？
Wow. Well, why waste time with an hotel room?

728
00:39:21,309 --> 00:39:24,745
为什么不在这儿？在这张长椅上？
Why not do it right there on a bench?

729
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,846
- 不 - 来，过来
Come here, come here, come here.

730
00:39:28,049 --> 00:39:30,449
好啦，我们不会今晚就死的
Okay. We're not gonna die tonight.

731
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,643
好吧，我太激动了，对不起
All right. Too bad. I'm sorry.

732
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,344
我举的只是一个极端的例子
That was an extreme example.

733
00:39:34,556 --> 00:39:36,990
- 对不起 - 没事
- I'm sorry. - Okay.

734
00:39:37,158 --> 00:39:38,819
我想要说的是...
What I... My point was, you know...

735
00:39:38,993 --> 00:39:41,826
我很难和别人深层次地沟通
...to truly communicate with people is very hard to do.

736
00:39:41,996 --> 00:39:44,794
我懂，不像日常的交流...
No, I know, most of our day-to-day exchanges...

737
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,490
我知道，我是说...
Yeah, no, I mean...

738
00:39:46,668 --> 00:39:49,296
- 不要把什么都跟性扯上关系 - 为什么不呢？
...not to bring everything back to sex... - But why not?

739
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,598
不，举个例子来说吧， 我的一个女朋友
No, this example, this friend of mine, she was talking about...

740
00:39:52,774 --> 00:39:55,800
- 她曾和我说起她跟她男朋友在床上的问题 - 然后呢
- She and her boyfriend... Problems in bed. - Right.

741
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:59,502
她说他们交往一年之后，她开始告诉他...
And how when they had been dating for a year she started telling him...

742
00:39:59,681 --> 00:40:02,673
...怎样才能让她获得更多的快感 而这让她男友非常生气！
...what he could do to please her more, and it freaked him out.

743
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,181
- 为什么？ - 他很生气
- Why? - Totally.

744
00:40:04,385 --> 00:40:06,376
他觉得这是说自己做得不好
He thought it meant he was a bad lover...

745
00:40:06,588 --> 00:40:08,453
也许她不该等这么久才说
Maybe she shouldn't have waited so long.

746
00:40:08,623 --> 00:40:10,989
- 你知道，一年以后... - 没错，不过男人也太容易被激怒了！
- After a year... - But men are so easily offended.

747
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,650
- 你觉得比女人还容易？ - 当然了，在这一点上毫无疑问！
- What, more than women? - Definitely on that subject.

748
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,193
- 你这么觉得？ - 没错
- You think so? - Yeah, yeah.

749
00:40:15,964 --> 00:40:18,057
也许这是因为
Well, maybe it's because, you know...

750
00:40:18,232 --> 00:40:22,293
- 男人比较容易获得满足 - 获得满足？
...men are easier to... To please. - To please?

751
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,495
- 我不知道 - 没错，他们绝对是的
- Well, I don't know. - Yeah, they are. They're definitely.

752
00:40:25,707 --> 00:40:27,834
总之我的朋友对我说
Anyway, this friend, she was telling me...

753
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:31,672
...下次她再交男朋友她会给他做一个问卷...
...next time she dates a man, she's gonna make a little questionnaire...

754
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:35,304
- 问明什么是他们喜欢的和不喜欢的 - 你是说写下来还是大声问？
...about what they like and dislike... - What, written down, or out loud?

755
00:40:35,483 --> 00:40:37,212
当然是写下来
Yeah, mostly written down.

756
00:40:37,385 --> 00:40:41,048
不过答案不仅仅是“是”或“否” 应该要更详细一点
But it wouldn't be just yes or no. It would be a bit more complex than that.

757
00:40:41,222 --> 00:40:44,714
打个比方，如果问题是 “你喜欢性虐待吗？”
Like, for example, if the question is: "Are you into S & M?"

758
00:40:44,892 --> 00:40:49,727
答案可以是: “不，但是偶尔为之也不错”
The answer could be: "No, but a good spanking once in a while doesn't hurt. "

759
00:40:49,897 --> 00:40:53,594
- 怎么样？ - 好，或者是“你喜欢在做爱时讲一些激发情欲的话吗？”
Right, or like: "Do you like talking dirty in bed?"

760
00:40:53,768 --> 00:40:57,226
- 类似这种问题？ - 对，不过不只是这么泛泛的
- That kind of thing? - Yeah, but not just like any dirty talk.

761
00:40:57,405 --> 00:40:59,771
要说：“你喜欢听什么样的词”？
Just "What specific word would you like to hear?"

762
00:40:59,941 --> 00:41:01,272
- 你是问我吗？ - 恩，是啊
- What, me? - Well, yeah.

763
00:41:01,442 --> 00:41:04,104
比如你喜欢听什么样的话？
For example what specific word would you like to hear?

764
00:41:04,278 --> 00:41:05,905
我不知道
I don't know.

765
00:41:07,415 --> 00:41:09,940
你觉得“小蜜桃”这词怎样？
What do you feel about the word "pussy"?

766
00:41:10,151 --> 00:41:12,915
我很喜欢
I love it.

767
00:41:13,287 --> 00:41:14,948
很好
Good.

768
00:41:15,156 --> 00:41:18,125
没想到九年之后我们都变得这么现实了
It's amazing what perverts we've become in the past nine years.

769
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:21,591
至少我们现不用把每次新的性体验...
At least now we don't have to pretend each new sexual experience...

770
00:41:21,763 --> 00:41:23,458
...都当作是是改变我们人生的大事
...is, like, a life-altering event.

771
00:41:23,665 --> 00:41:27,123
我知道，你已经有过了那么多次感情经历 现在都快失去激情了
I know. By now, you've stuck it in so many places it's about to fall off.

772
00:41:27,301 --> 00:41:31,032
我也没指望你会一直想着我
And I can't realistically expect you've become anything but a total ho.

773
00:41:31,205 --> 00:41:34,606
- 哦，谢谢 - 不，我很抱（歉）...
- Yeah, thank you. - No, I'm s...

774
00:41:35,209 --> 00:41:38,201
- 没错阿，你该怎样呢？ - 我该...
- That's true. What can you do? - What can you do?

775
00:41:38,379 --> 00:41:42,145
对了，你平时都写些什么歌？ 我还不知道你会写歌呢
So, what kind of songs do you write? I didn't know you did that.

776
00:41:42,316 --> 00:41:43,544
- 什么类型的？ - 是啊
- What kind? - Yeah, sure.

777
00:41:43,718 --> 00:41:45,379
- 我不知道，只是歌而已 - 比如
- I don't know, just songs. - Like?

778
00:41:45,553 --> 00:41:48,215
比如有些是有关人的
Like, some are about, you know, people.

779
00:41:48,389 --> 00:41:50,050
恩，或是各种爱恨情仇... 还有一首是写我的猫猫的！
Relationships. One's about my cat.

780
00:41:50,224 --> 00:41:52,715
- 唱首听听！ - 不行，我没有吉他
- Sing one. - No, I can't. I don't have a guitar.

781
00:41:52,894 --> 00:41:54,452
- 来吧，清唱一首 - 不行，不行
- Come on. A cappella. - No, no, no.

782
00:41:54,629 --> 00:41:57,792
没有吉他伴奏我唱不了歌 你太过分了！
I'm not singing a song without a guitar. You're nuts.

783
00:41:58,299 --> 00:42:00,233
为什么？
Why not?

784
00:42:00,401 --> 00:42:02,835
- 好吧，至少不是现在 - 就一首
- No, okay. Not now. No. - One.

785
00:42:03,004 --> 00:42:06,269
如果不是现在，还有什么时候呢？ 你想六个月后在这儿见面吗？带着吉他？
If not now, when? You want to meet here in six months with a guitar?

786
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:07,931
我会飞过来的
I'll fly all the way over here.

787
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:11,101
- 但你不一定能赶上地铁 - 好啦，这不好笑
- You may or may not make the M閠ro. - Okay, that's funny.

788
00:42:11,479 --> 00:42:13,572
- 我们该回书店了！ - 没事的
- We've got to get back. - We'll be all right.

789
00:42:13,748 --> 00:42:15,739
- 你会错过你的航班的，快点！ - 好吧
- You're gonna miss your flight. - All right.

790
00:42:15,917 --> 00:42:17,748
我们可以沿塞纳河走走，很漂亮的
<i>We can walk down La Seine. It's nice.</i>

791
00:42:17,919 --> 00:42:19,477
好吧
Okay.

792
00:42:20,088 --> 00:42:23,785
- 那你是要飞回纽约吗？ - 是的
- So you're flying back to New York? - Yeah, yeah.

793
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:29,619
我在文章中读到你结婚了， 还有了一个孩子，真是太好了！
So I read in that article that you're married with a kid. That's great.

794
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,288
没错，他已经... 他已经四岁了
Yeah, he's... He's 4.

795
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:34,662
- 他叫什么？ - 亨利，小汉克
- What's his name? - Henry. Little Hank.

796
00:42:34,836 --> 00:42:37,634
- 他很可爱 - 当然了
- He's so much fun. - Oh, wow, I'm sure.

797
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:40,774
- 你的太太呢？她是做什么的？ - 她在小学教书
- Your wife, what does she do? - She teaches elementary school.

798
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:43,869
- 你有孩子吗？ - 是的，有两个。糟了！
- Do you have kids? - Yes, two... Shit!

799
00:42:44,045 --> 00:42:45,512
- 怎么了？ - 我把他们落在车上了！
- What? - I left them in the car!

800
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,342
窗关得死死的，快有六个月了... 他们会有事吗？
With the windows up, six months ago! Think they're okay?

801
00:42:48,516 --> 00:42:51,144
没有啦，我开玩笑的 不过我很想要小孩
No, I'm kidding. No, but I want to have kids someday.

802
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,184
- 只是还没做好准备 - 没有吗？
- I'm just not ready yet. - No?

803
00:42:53,354 --> 00:42:56,517
- 不过我现在正在认真谈恋爱 - 噢是吗？这很好啊
- I'm in a good relationship, though. - Oh yeah? That's good.

804
00:42:56,691 --> 00:42:58,784
- 他是做什么的？ - 他是个摄影记者
- What's he do? - He's a photojournalist.

805
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,791
专门做战地新闻
He does war coverage.

806
00:43:00,962 --> 00:43:03,522
他经常出差，不过从某种角度对我来说 是一件好事，因为我实在是太忙了
He's away a lot, which is good because I'm so busy.

807
00:43:03,698 --> 00:43:07,794
不过那不是很危险吗？ 我是说，不是有很多人在战争中丧生吗？
But isn't that dangerous? Aren't a lot of those guys getting killed these days?

808
00:43:07,969 --> 00:43:11,200
他向我保证不会太冒险的 不过我还是会经常担心
He promises me he doesn't take risks, but I often worry.

809
00:43:11,372 --> 00:43:13,897
他一拿起相机就什么都不顾了
He goes in this trance when he photographs something.

810
00:43:14,075 --> 00:43:17,408
- 什么意思？ - 有一次我们在新德里
- What do you mean? - Well, once we were in New Delhi...

811
00:43:17,578 --> 00:43:19,068
见到一个流浪汉，他躺在人行道上
...and we passed a bum on the...

812
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,510
- 炸弹（谐音）？ - 流浪汉！无家可归的人
- A bomb? - A bum. A homeless.

813
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,013
哦，流浪汉
All right, right.

814
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:27,018
总之他看起来需要帮助， 但是我男朋友的第一个反应就是拿起相机！
He looked like he needed help, but his first reaction was to photograph him.

815
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:30,021
他凑到离那个人的脸非常近的地方 整理他的衣领，让他看起来显得更精神
He went really close to his face, fixing his collar...

816
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:31,920
他似乎完全不在乎那个人
...totally detached from the person.

817
00:43:32,093 --> 00:43:34,857
不过要做好工作不就得这样吗？
But don't you have to be like that to be good at that job?

818
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,360
是啊，我知道啊，我不是...
Yeah, I mean, I'm not...

819
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:39,659
我不是由此来看他的为人 他的工作是重要的也是高尚的
I'm not judging him. What he does is essential and incredible.

820
00:43:39,834 --> 00:43:41,927
我只是说这是我自己永远做不到的
All I'm saying is that I could never do it.

821
00:43:42,103 --> 00:43:43,866
我们上那船吧！快！
Let's get on that boat. Come on.

822
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,369
- 不！ - 快，很有趣的！
- No! - Come on, it'll be fun.

823
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,872
- 你没时间了！我们得走了 - 它就要开了
- You don't have time! - They're about to take off.

824
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,442
我还有15分钟呢 你有手机吗？
I've got 5 more minutes. Do you have a cell phone?

825
00:43:50,611 --> 00:43:52,943
- 有 - 那就好，我有那个司机的号码
- Yeah. - All right, I've got that driver's number.

826
00:43:53,114 --> 00:43:55,275
我可以打电话给他 让他在下一站停船的地方接我们
I can call him to pick us up at the next stop.

827
00:43:55,449 --> 00:43:59,351
好吧，可我从来没上过那船， 这是给游客的，太丢脸了
I've never been on those boats. It's for tourists, it's embarrassing.

828
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,851
好啦，没事的
Okay. All right.

829
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,000
（法语）- 唔，我们可以上船了吗？ - 当然

830
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,700
- （法语）请给我两张票！ - 不，让我来，让我来
No, I'll get it, I'll get it.

831
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:09,300
- （法语）不，不，还是我来吧 - 好吧，好吧，好吧
All right. All right, all right.

832
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,800
- （法语）下一站停在哪里？ - （法语）亨利四世码头

833
00:44:12,767 --> 00:44:14,098
谢谢
Thank you.

834
00:44:14,268 --> 00:44:16,429
- 那你现在是跟他沉浸在爱河里咯？ - 谁？
- So are you in love with that guy? - What guy?

835
00:44:16,604 --> 00:44:19,937
- 那个战地摄影师 - 哦，当然！
- The war photographer. - Yes, of course.

836
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,700
（法语）- 你们可以进去了 - 谢谢

837
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,939
对不起，你的手机...
So do you have that cell phone?

838
00:44:26,113 --> 00:44:27,876
哦，对
Oh, yeah.

839
00:44:28,049 --> 00:44:29,880
- 好，让我看看他的号码.... - 好
- Okay, let's see... - Okay.

840
00:44:30,051 --> 00:44:31,382
我该怎么跟他说呢？
What do I tell him?

841
00:44:31,552 --> 00:44:33,747
让他在亨利四世码头等着
<i>Tell him to pick you up at Quai Henri Quatre.</i>

842
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:36,719
哦，见鬼，什么码头？
<i>Oh, shit. Quai...?</i>

843
00:44:36,891 --> 00:44:39,655
亨利四世，亨利四世码头
<i>Henri Quatre. Quai Henri Quatre.</i>

844
00:44:39,861 --> 00:44:41,886
亨利四世
<i>Henri Quatre.</i>

845
00:44:42,063 --> 00:44:45,055
你怎么了？不对，你要我来说吗？ 亨利四世
<i>What's wrong with you? No, do you want me to...? Henri Quatre.</i>

846
00:44:45,233 --> 00:44:46,598
- 亨利四世？ - 没错！
- Henry Four? - Yes!

847
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,759
- 那你为什么不直接说？ - 对不起！
- Come on, why didn't you say so? - I'm sorry. Okay.

848
00:45:01,916 --> 00:45:03,816
你好，是菲利普吗？
Yeah, is this Philippe?

849
00:45:03,985 --> 00:45:06,647
菲利普，我是杰西·华莱士
Yeah. Philippe, this is Jesse Wallace.

850
00:45:06,821 --> 00:45:08,186
对
Yeah.

851
00:45:08,389 --> 00:45:12,621
呃，听我说，我现在在一条游船上
Well, listen, I'm on one of those boats, right?

852
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:15,694
我们将会在亨利四世码头下船
And we're gonna arrive at Henry Four.

853
00:45:15,897 --> 00:45:19,264
亨利四号码头 你知道在哪儿吗？
At Port Henry Four. You know what that is?

854
00:45:19,433 --> 00:45:21,924
很好，你带着我的行李吧？
All right, great. And you have my bags, right?

855
00:45:22,103 --> 00:45:25,038
我们再过...总之下一站就到了
Yeah, so we'll be there in... I don't know, it's the next stop.

856
00:45:25,206 --> 00:45:27,606
好，再见
Okay. Au revoir.

857
00:45:28,676 --> 00:45:31,144
- 安排好了？ - 恩
- It's okay? - Yeah, yeah.

858
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:33,280
哇！
Oh, wow.

859
00:45:33,447 --> 00:45:36,143
- 看这边啊，巴黎圣母院！ - 哇
- Notre Dame, man. Check that out. - Oh, wow.

860
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:40,310
我听过一个故事 说的是占领巴黎的德军
I heard this story once about when the Germans were occupying Paris...

861
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:42,115
...撤出的时候
...and they had to retreat back.

862
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:44,224
他们在巴黎圣母院埋了很多炸药
They wired Notre Dame to blow...

863
00:45:44,425 --> 00:45:48,657
...但他们得留一个人来按爆破的按钮
...but they had to leave one guy in charge of hitting the switch.

864
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:51,889
但那个人，那个士兵 他却下不了手！
And the guy, the soldier, he couldn't do it.

865
00:45:52,066 --> 00:45:55,797
他只是呆呆地坐着 惊叹这地方的美妙
He just sat there, knocked out by how beautiful the place was.

866
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:57,835
当盟军部队到达的时候
Then, when the Allied troops came in...

867
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:01,497
他们发现炸药还在那里 但按钮没人碰过
...they found all the explosives lying there and the switch unturned...

868
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:05,339
同样的情景还发生在 圣心堂，埃菲尔铁塔...
...and they found the same thing at the Sacr?Coeur, Eiffel Tower...

869
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:07,811
...很多地方
...couple other places, I think.

870
00:46:07,982 --> 00:46:09,916
这是真的吗？
Is that true?

871
00:46:10,084 --> 00:46:13,178
我不知道 不过我一直很喜欢这个故事
I don't know. I always liked the story, though.

872
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:14,719
没错，很震撼的一个故事
Yeah, that's a great story.

873
00:46:14,956 --> 00:46:17,823
你相信巴黎圣母院有一天会消失吗？
But you have to think that Notre Dame will be gone one day.

874
00:46:17,992 --> 00:46:21,155
这里曾经是另一座教堂，就在这
There used to be another church at the Seine, right there.

875
00:46:21,329 --> 00:46:24,162
- 什么，同一个地方？ - 是的
- What, right in the same spot? - Yeah.

876
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,067
这样好舒服，我从来没有试过！
You know, this is great. I've never done this.

877
00:46:28,235 --> 00:46:30,863
- 是啊 - 我已经忘了巴黎有多美
- Yeah. - I forget about how beautiful Paris is.

878
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,665
其实当个游客也不错
It's not so bad, being a tourist.

879
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,331
- 谢谢你带我上这船 - 不用客气
- Thanks for getting me on the boat. - You're welcome.

880
00:46:35,509 --> 00:46:38,410
我觉得我在写那本书的时候 就好像在造什么东西
I think that book that I wrote was like building something...

881
00:46:38,913 --> 00:46:43,077
以免我忘记我们经历过点点滴滴
...so that I wouldn't forget the details of the time that we spent together.

882
00:46:43,284 --> 00:46:47,050
你懂吗，就好像一个备忘录 告诉我我们的确见过面
You know, like, just as a reminder, that once, we really did meet.

883
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:50,190
你懂吗，那是真的，真的发生过
You know, that this was real, this happened.

884
00:46:50,358 --> 00:46:52,349
我很高兴你这么说，因为...
I'm happy you're saying that, because...

885
00:46:52,526 --> 00:46:56,792
我是说，我觉得自己很没用， 因为我从来不能这么洒脱
I mean, I always feel like a freak because I'm never able to move on like this:

886
00:46:57,932 --> 00:47:01,231
人们只是随意留情， 甚至即使是认真的感情
People just have an affair, or even entire relationships...

887
00:47:01,435 --> 00:47:03,801
...人们也会分手，然后忘记
...they break up and they forget.

888
00:47:04,005 --> 00:47:07,873
就像换另一个牌子的麦片一样简单
They move on like they would have changed brand of cereals.

889
00:47:08,509 --> 00:47:11,740
可我觉得我永远忘不了 跟我交往过的每一个人
I feel I was never able to forget anyone I've been with...

890
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:17,475
..因为他们每个人都有很不一样的特质
...because each person had their own specific qualities.

891
00:47:17,651 --> 00:47:22,520
你不能取代任何人 失去的就失去了
You can never replace anyone. What is lost is lost.

892
00:47:23,657 --> 00:47:27,821
每段感情结束的时候我都很受伤 我从来没有完全恢复过
Each relationship, when it ends, really damages me. I never fully recover.

893
00:47:28,029 --> 00:47:31,157
所以我尽量避免介入感情
That's why I'm very careful with getting involved...

894
00:47:31,332 --> 00:47:33,391
..因为那种痛真的是太深了！
...because it hurts too much.

895
00:47:33,567 --> 00:47:36,730
即使是做爱！ 其实我不喜欢那样
Even getting laid, I actually don't do that...

896
00:47:36,904 --> 00:47:39,805
因为我会很怀念一个人很平常的东西
...because I will miss of the person the most mundane things.

897
00:47:39,974 --> 00:47:42,670
好比那些细节
Like I'm obsessed with little things.

898
00:47:43,044 --> 00:47:45,342
或者也许我有点神经质 但当我小的时候...
Maybe I'm crazy, but when I was a little girl...

899
00:47:45,546 --> 00:47:48,447
妈妈告诉我，我上学经常迟到
...my mom told me that I was always late to school.

900
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:50,982
有一天她跟着我想知道为什么
One day she followed me to see why.

901
00:47:51,185 --> 00:47:55,485
我正看着栗子从树上掉下来，滚到便道上
I was looking at chestnuts falling from the trees, rolling on the sidewalk...

902
00:47:55,656 --> 00:48:01,424
...或者是蚂蚁过马路，叶子在树干上的映出的倒影
...or ants crossing the road, the way a leaf casts a shadow on a tree trunk.

903
00:48:01,595 --> 00:48:03,620
种种小事
Little things.

904
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,962
我想对人也是一样
I think it's the same with people.

905
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:09,368
我看到的是他们的细节，很细微
I see in them little details, so specific to each of them...

906
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:13,666
...那些能感动我的细节， 然后我就会想念他们，一直想念
...that move me and that I miss and will always miss.

907
00:48:13,841 --> 00:48:15,331
你不能取代任何人
You can never replace anyone...

908
00:48:15,509 --> 00:48:19,468
因为每个人都有他那种美丽的，独特的细微之处
...because everyone is made of such beautiful, specific details.

909
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:26,215
就好像我记得，你的胡子上有一点红色
Like, I remember the way your beard has a bit of red in it...

910
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:29,649
...我记得你离开的那天早上...
...and how the sun was making it glow...

911
00:48:29,857 --> 00:48:32,655
...朝阳是怎样照的它闪闪亮
...that morning right before you left.

912
00:48:33,594 --> 00:48:37,496
我一直记着，我非常怀念
I remembered that, and I missed it.

913
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:38,996
很神经质，对吧？
Really crazy, right?

914
00:48:39,633 --> 00:48:43,535
现在我明白了，你想知道 为什么我写了那本烂书吗？
Now I know for sure. You wanna know why I wrote that stupid book?

915
00:48:43,737 --> 00:48:46,672
- 为什么？ - 因为这样你就会参加巴黎的一场读者见面会
- Why? - So you'd come to a reading in Paris...

916
00:48:46,874 --> 00:48:51,038
...而我就可以走过去，问你： “你到底去哪里了？”
...and I could walk up to you and ask, "Where the fuck were you?"

917
00:48:51,479 --> 00:48:53,674
你真的觉得我今天会来？
No... You think I'd be here today?

918
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:58,376
真的，我之所以写这本书，从某种意义来讲 就是为了能找到你
I'm serious. I think I wrote it, in a way, to try to find you.

919
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:00,678
好啦，这....我知道这不是真的
Okay, that's... I know that's not true...

920
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:03,187
- 不过听了还是很高兴 - 我觉得这是真的
...but that's sweet of you. - I think it is true.

921
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:05,858
我们还有机会再见面吗？
What were the chances of us ever meeting again?

922
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:09,857
过了那个十二月，我想机率基本就是零了吧
After that December, I'd say almost zero.

923
00:49:10,264 --> 00:49:12,323
不过反正我们也不是来真的，对吗？
But we're not real anyway, right?

924
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,697
我们只不过是那个老妇人梦中的角色
We're just characters in that old lady's dream.

925
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,270
她在她的病床上回忆年轻时的故事
She's on her deathbed, fantasizing about her youth.

926
00:49:18,439 --> 00:49:20,532
所以我们当然会见面！
So of course we had to meet again.

927
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:24,644
天哪！你为什么那天没有出现在维也纳？
Oh, God. Why weren't you there in Vienna?

928
00:49:25,779 --> 00:49:29,545
- 我告诉过你了！ - 我知道，但是...
- I told you why. - I know why, I just...

929
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:31,947
我真的希望你去了！
I wish you would have been.

930
00:49:32,153 --> 00:49:34,383
我们的生活可能会完全不一样！
Our lives might have been so much different.

931
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:36,750
你真这么觉得？
You think so?

932
00:49:36,924 --> 00:49:38,551
没错
I actually do.

933
00:49:38,759 --> 00:49:41,887
也许不会呢，也许最后我们会憎恨对方呢
Maybe not. Maybe we would have hated each other eventually.

934
00:49:42,096 --> 00:49:44,963
是吗，就像现在我们这样憎恨对方？
What, like we hate each other now?

935
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:50,394
你知道的，可能我们... 我们只适合那种偶遇...
You know, maybe we're... We're only good at brief encounters...

936
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:54,769
...在温暖的天气里 漫步在欧洲的街头
...walking around in European cities, in warm climate.

937
00:49:55,276 --> 00:49:58,404
天哪，为什么我们没有交换电话号码呢？
Oh, God. Why didn't we exchange phone numbers and stuff?

938
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:00,740
为什么？
Why didn't we do that?

939
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:03,281
因为那时我们太年轻，不成熟？
Because we were young and stupid.

940
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:05,748
你觉得我们现在还是如此吗？
Do you think we still are?

941
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,047
我觉得，当你年轻的时候 你会相信...
I guess when you're young you just believe...

942
00:50:08,222 --> 00:50:10,747
...你会认识很多人
...there'll be many people you'll connect with.

943
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:14,053
但后来你才会发现能交流的人其实很少
Later in life you realize it only happens a few times.

944
00:50:14,228 --> 00:50:17,823
何况你又不能保证和他们好好相处 就这样，失去联系了
And you can screw it up, you know. Misconnect.

945
00:50:18,065 --> 00:50:20,465
过去的就让它过去吧 事情本来就是这样的
The past is the past. It was meant to be that way.

946
00:50:20,634 --> 00:50:23,296
你真的相信吗？ 任何事情都是注定的？
You really believe that? That everything's fated?

947
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:27,463
这个嘛，你明白吗，世界也许 没有我们想的那么多变
Well, you know, the world might be less free than we think.

948
00:50:27,641 --> 00:50:29,336
是吗？
Yeah?

949
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:33,512
如果给定了特定的条件 就总会发生一样的结果
When given these exact circumstances, that's what will happen every time.

950
00:50:33,714 --> 00:50:36,740
两份氢，一份氧，获得的总是水
Two part hydrogen, one part oxygen, you'll get water every time.

951
00:50:36,917 --> 00:50:40,318
不， 我是说如果你祖母晚去世一个礼拜呢？
No, I mean, what if your grandmother had lived a week longer, you know?

952
00:50:40,487 --> 00:50:43,115
或者是早一个礼拜去世？ 甚至是几天？
Or passed away a week earlier? Days, even?

953
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,848
事情都可能完全不一样！ 我坚信这一点！
Things might have been different.

954
00:50:45,025 --> 00:50:49,257
- 不，你不能这样想，那只是... - 我知道对于大多数事情来说的确是注定的
- You can't think like that, it's... - You shouldn't on most things, but...

955
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:54,629
但是，只是这件事， 我觉得这事很不对劲
It's just, on this one, it seemed like something was off, you know.

956
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:58,866
你知道吗，在我结婚前的那个月 我一直都在想着你
In the months leading up to my wedding, I was thinking about you all the time.

957
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:02,873
即使在去婚礼的路上，我坐在车里 我的一个朋友送我进城
Even on my way there, I'm in the car, a buddy of mine is driving me downtown...

958
00:51:03,043 --> 00:51:05,807
...我看着窗户 觉得我看到你了
...and I'm staring out the window and I think I see you...

959
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:08,141
...离教堂不远...
...not far from the church, right...

960
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:10,806
...收起一把雨伞，走进一家熟食店...
...folding up an umbrella and walking into a deli...

961
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:14,614
...就在百老汇和十三街的交汇处
...on the corner of 3th and Broadway.

962
00:51:14,788 --> 00:51:18,315
那时我觉得我快要发疯了你知道吗？ 但现在我觉得这也许就是你
And I thought I was going crazy. But now I think it probably was you.

963
00:51:19,126 --> 00:51:21,754
我住在百老汇和十一街的交汇处
I lived on th and Broadway.

964
00:51:22,529 --> 00:51:24,394
你看！
You see?

965
00:51:25,699 --> 00:51:29,465
那，结婚的感觉怎样，你还没说呢
So, what is it like to be married? You haven't talked much about that.

966
00:51:30,371 --> 00:51:33,898
我没有吗？真奇怪
I haven't? How weird.

967
00:51:34,408 --> 00:51:38,367
我不知道怎么说，我们是在上大学的时候认识的
I don't know. We met, you know, when I was in college.

968
00:51:38,545 --> 00:51:44,916
有几年，我们分分合合，然后...
And we broke up and got back together for a period of years, and then...

969
00:51:45,552 --> 00:51:49,784
怎么来着？我们好像又在一起了 然后她就怀孕了...
What? We were sort of back together and she was pregnant...

970
00:51:50,424 --> 00:51:52,016
所以就结婚咯
...so marriage.

971
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,217
她怎么样？
What is she like?

972
00:51:54,395 --> 00:51:57,421
她是个好老师，好妈妈
She's a great teacher, a good mom.

973
00:51:57,598 --> 00:52:00,658
她很聪明，很漂亮
She's smart, pretty, you know.

974
00:52:00,834 --> 00:52:02,893
我记得那时我想...
I remember thinking at the time...

975
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:05,436
...很多我所崇拜的人..
...that so many of the men that I admired most...

976
00:52:05,606 --> 00:52:10,441
...他们的生命都奉献给了 比自己更重要的东西
...that their lives were dedicated to something greater than themselves.

977
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:13,907
所以你结婚是因为你崇拜的人都结婚了？
So you got married because men you admired were married?

978
00:52:14,081 --> 00:52:20,350
不，不... 准确来说是... 我内心中有种对自我的完美期许
No, no. It's more like I had this... This idea of my best self, you know?

979
00:52:20,521 --> 00:52:22,250
你懂吗？我想去追求那种自我
And I wanted to pursue that...

980
00:52:22,423 --> 00:52:25,187
即使代价是失去真实的自我！
...even if it might have been overriding my honest self.

981
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:26,758
你懂我的意思吗？
You know what I'm saying?

982
00:52:26,927 --> 00:52:31,455
我记得在那个时候 我并不觉得和“谁”结婚这个问题很重要
In the moment, I remember thinking it didn't much matter, the who of it all.

983
00:52:31,699 --> 00:52:34,190
一个人并不是你生命的全部
I mean, that nobody is gonna be everything to you...

984
00:52:34,368 --> 00:52:37,235
...到头来这只是一种负责的表现...
...and that it's just the action of committing yourself...

985
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:40,896
...就是说，负担起你的责任来，这才是最重要的
...you know, meeting your responsibilities, that matters.

986
00:52:41,075 --> 00:52:44,704
我是说，爱是什么？ 如果它不是尊敬，信赖和钦佩的话？
I mean, what is love, right, if it's not respect, trust, admiration?

987
00:52:44,878 --> 00:52:47,938
而我当时都感觉到了啊
And I... I felt all those things.

988
00:52:48,115 --> 00:52:50,982
谈到现在，我感觉我好像在办一个托儿所
Cut to the present, and I feel like I'm running a nursery...

989
00:52:51,151 --> 00:52:53,813
...跟一个我曾经约会过的人
...with somebody I used to date, you know.

990
00:52:53,987 --> 00:52:55,818
我是说，我就像一个修道士
I mean, I'm like a monk, you know.

991
00:52:55,989 --> 00:53:00,892
我在过去的4年中 做爱还不到10次
I mean, I've had sex less than 0 times in the last four years.

992
00:53:01,395 --> 00:53:03,955
- 干嘛，干嘛？你笑我？ - 没有
- What, what? You laughing at me? - No.

993
00:53:04,131 --> 00:53:06,964
- 听起来很可悲吗？ - 你看到过有修道士做过10次爱的吗？
- It sounds pathetic? - What monastery do monks have sex...?

994
00:53:07,134 --> 00:53:10,467
好，你是对的，我比一般的修道士强，可以了吧？
Okay, you're right, I'm doing better than most monks.

995
00:53:10,637 --> 00:53:13,128
但是我的确觉得，如果现在有人碰我的话
But I do, I feel like if somebody were to touch me...

996
00:53:13,307 --> 00:53:15,502
我就会马上融化的了
...I would dissolve into molecules.

997
00:53:15,676 --> 00:53:18,440
好啦，我们到了，该走了，快
Well, we're here. We've gotta go. Come on.

998
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,477
该死
Shit.

999
00:53:25,687 --> 00:53:28,989
- （法语）晚上好 - （法语）晚上好

1000
00:53:32,993 --> 00:53:35,962
- 我很遗憾听到那些 - 什么？
- I'm sorry to hear that, you know. - What?

1001
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:39,190
你对你的婚姻好像不怎么满意
You're not that happy with your marriage.

1002
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,028
- 我刚才说到的那个朋友，她是神经科医生 - 她怎么了？
- This friend of mine, she's a shrink... - How's she doing?

1003
00:53:42,202 --> 00:53:43,794
她的生活很糟，不过...
She's a mess, but...

1004
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:47,202
她告诉我她遇过很多夫妻...
No, she said she's been dealing with couples that are breaking up...

1005
00:53:47,408 --> 00:53:49,535
- 为了同样的理由而分开 - 什么理由？
...for the same reason. - What reason is that?

1006
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:52,474
他们都期望，在共同生活了几年以后
They all expected, after a few years of living together...

1007
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:54,978
...他们的热情，欲望还和当初一样
...for the passion, that desire, to be the same.

1008
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:56,616
- 这是不可能的！ - 是啊，没错
- Yeah, right. - It's impossible.

1009
00:53:56,784 --> 00:53:58,115
而且谢天谢地...
And thank God...

1010
00:53:58,285 --> 00:54:02,016
...如果我们一直保持激情的话 我们会得动脉瘤的
...we'd end up with aneurysms in that constant state of excitement, right?

1011
00:54:02,189 --> 00:54:03,986
我们一生将一事无成
We'd do nothing at all with our lives.

1012
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:07,650
如果你每5分钟就做一次爱 你还能写完你的书吗？
Would you have finished your book if you were fucking every five minutes?

1013
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:10,422
我很乐意接受这个挑战
I might have welcomed the challenge, I mean...

1014
00:54:10,631 --> 00:54:13,361
但是，你懂吗，很自然的 当你太太生了小孩以后
It's natural for your wife after the birth of your son...

1015
00:54:13,534 --> 00:54:16,162
- 她就会把她的爱转移到小孩身上 - 当然
...to give all her love to the little one. - Of course.

1016
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:19,499
想想看如果她执迷于性爱， 像野猫一样不停挑逗你
If she was obsessed with sex, riding you like a wildcat...

1017
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,402
这不合情理，对吧？
That wouldn't make any sense, right?

1018
00:54:21,575 --> 00:54:25,170
不是这样的，你说得都很有道理 但这不是性的问题
Everything you're saying makes sense. It's not about sex.

1019
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,540
是啊，我知道，很明显不是
No, I know. It's obvious.

1020
00:54:27,714 --> 00:54:29,306
我...
I...

1021
00:54:30,451 --> 00:54:33,648
你知道，现在的夫妻感情很复杂
You know, couples are so confused lately.

1022
00:54:33,821 --> 00:54:36,085
我觉得肯定是因为...
I think it must be that...

1023
00:54:36,256 --> 00:54:40,215
...男人总想让人觉得他们很重要 但事实已不是这样了
...men need to feel essential and they don't anymore.

1024
00:54:40,394 --> 00:54:42,919
多年以来，这种观念深植于他们脑海之中...
It's been imprinted in their head for so many years...

1025
00:54:43,096 --> 00:54:44,825
...好像他们就必须要是家里的顶梁柱
...that they had to be the provider.

1026
00:54:44,998 --> 00:54:48,661
比如，我在工作中就是一个坚强，独立的女性
Like, I'm a strong, independent woman in my professional life.

1027
00:54:48,836 --> 00:54:50,360
我不需要一个男人养我
I don't need a man to feed me...

1028
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:53,870
...但我仍要一个男人爱我，而我也爱他
...but I still need a man to love me and that I could love.

1029
00:54:55,242 --> 00:54:57,904
- 好啦，我看到你的司机了 - 是的
- So your driver's here. - Yeah.

1030
00:54:58,111 --> 00:54:59,772
那，我想我该告别了
Well, I guess this is goodbye.

1031
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:01,607
- 你最好把你的... - 不
- You better give me your... - No, no.

1032
00:55:01,782 --> 00:55:04,012
我们不如送你回家吧
Why don't we just give you a ride home?

1033
00:55:04,184 --> 00:55:06,516
- 这个嘛，我可以搭地铁，我没事 - 不，我...
- Well, I can take the M閠ro. I'm fine. - No, I...

1034
00:55:06,687 --> 00:55:09,622
我的飞机要10点才飞 我会提前两个钟头去
My flight's not until 0. I'll be arriving two hours early.

1035
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:11,223
这样我们就可以继续谈了
This way we can keep talking.

1036
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:13,518
- 先生，能...？ - 那不顺路的
- Monsieur, can...? - It's not on the way.

1037
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,600
（法语）您能把我带到马场附近的十号路吗？

1038
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:18,900
（法语）当然可以

1039
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:21,100
- （法语）我们走吧 - （法语）麻烦您了

1040
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,700
（法语）不，不，没问题

1041
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:25,700
（法语）您就把我带到“水塔”地铁站附近就行了

1042
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:27,700
- （法语）好吗？ - （法语）好的，没问题

1043
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:28,300
（法语）谢谢
You told him where you are and all that?

1044
00:55:28,275 --> 00:55:30,209
你把你的住址什么的都告诉他了？

1045
00:55:30,377 --> 00:55:32,004
是的
Yeah.

1046
00:55:35,315 --> 00:55:37,783
- 他知道他要去哪了？ - 是的
- He knows where he's going? - Yes.

1047
00:55:37,951 --> 00:55:39,816
太好了
Glad somebody does.

1048
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:44,116
- 这比搭地铁好，对吧？ - 当然
- But this is better than the M閠ro, right? - Definitely.

1049
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:50,963
我在想，对我来说， 还是不要把事情想得太浪漫比较好
I was thinking, for me it's better I don't romanticize things as much anymore.

1050
00:55:51,131 --> 00:55:52,996
我一直都吃这个亏
I was suffering so much all the time.

1051
00:55:53,166 --> 00:55:56,658
我仍旧有很多梦想，但它们都与我的感情生活无关
I still have lots of dreams, but they're not in regard to my love life.

1052
00:55:56,904 --> 00:55:59,270
这样并不会让我不开心， 因为事情本来就是这样的
It doesn't make me sad, it's just the way it is.

1053
00:55:59,473 --> 00:56:03,603
这就是你为什么要和一个 不常见面的人发生感情吗？
Is that why you're in a relationship with somebody who's never around?

1054
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:07,679
当然，我应付不了那种天天见面的感情
Yes, obviously I can't deal with the day-to-day life of a relationship.

1055
00:56:07,848 --> 00:56:09,941
我们相聚的时候可以充满激情
Yeah, we have this exciting time together...

1056
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:13,484
...然后他离去了，我会很想他 不过我起码不会痛不欲生
...and he leaves and I miss him, but at least I'm not dying inside.

1057
00:56:13,654 --> 00:56:16,088
如果有人一直在我身边 我会觉得窒息！
When someone's always around me, I'm suffocating.

1058
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:19,157
等等，可是你刚说你想要爱和被爱
No, wait, you just said that you need to love and be loved.

1059
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:22,192
没错，但是当我的确这么做时， 这马上会让我恶心！
Yeah, but when I do, it quickly makes me nauseous.

1060
00:56:22,362 --> 00:56:23,829
真是个灾难
It's a disaster.

1061
00:56:23,997 --> 00:56:26,659
我是说，我只有一个人独处的 时候才会真正开心
I mean, I'm really happy only when I'm on my own.

1062
00:56:26,833 --> 00:56:31,702
即使是一个人，也比坐在 情人边上却心不在焉要来的好
Even being alone, it's better than sitting next to a lover and feeling lonely.

1063
00:56:32,372 --> 00:56:34,306
浪漫对我来说并不是一件容易的事
It's not so easy for me to be a romantic.

1064
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:37,966
你开始的时候可能会这么做， 不过当你受过几次伤以后...
You start off that way, and after you've been screwed over a few times...

1065
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:42,479
..你就会拒绝那些虚幻的想法 接受生活中的现实
...you forget about your delusional ideas and you take what comes into your life.

1066
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,641
其实这也不见得对 我并没受过几次伤...
That's not even true. I haven't been screwed over...

1067
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:48,219
...我只是有太多平庸的感情了
...I've just had too many blah relationships.

1068
00:56:48,388 --> 00:56:50,219
他们不是对我不好，他们都很关心我...
They weren't mean, they cared for me...

1069
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:53,882
...但是我们却没有那种心灵上的沟通 或是发自心底的兴奋
...but there were no real connection or excitement.

1070
00:56:54,094 --> 00:56:56,221
起码我这边是这么感觉的
At least, not from my side.

1071
00:56:56,396 --> 00:56:59,058
天哪，真遗憾，有这么糟糕吗？
God, I'm sorry, is it really that bad?

1072
00:56:59,232 --> 00:57:01,291
没有吧，对吗？
It's not, right?

1073
00:57:02,536 --> 00:57:05,300
你知道吗，其实也不是这样的 我...
You know, it's not even that. I was...

1074
00:57:05,472 --> 00:57:08,635
我本来是好好的，直到我读到你那本该死的书
I was fine until I read your fucking book.

1075
00:57:09,142 --> 00:57:10,803
它把陈年往事又翻起来了，你知道吗？
It stirred shit up, you know?

1076
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:13,806
它让我想起了，我曾经真正的浪漫过
It reminded me how genuinely romantic I was...

1077
00:57:13,981 --> 00:57:16,142
...我对于世界有过多少希望...
...how I had so much hope in things...

1078
00:57:16,316 --> 00:57:19,843
...而我现在已经完全不相信任何爱情了
...and now it's like I don't believe in anything that relates to love.

1079
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,011
我已经感觉不到人之间的感情了
I don't feel things for people anymore.

1080
00:57:23,156 --> 00:57:26,819
从某种意义上来说，我所有的浪漫 都在一夜之间消耗光了...
In a way, I put all my romanticism into that one night...

1081
00:57:26,994 --> 00:57:29,485
...而我将永远不可能再有那种感觉了
...and I was never able to feel all this again.

1082
00:57:29,663 --> 00:57:32,188
就好像，那一夜不知道怎么 引发了我的全部感情...
Like, somehow this night took things away from me...

1083
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:34,766
...而我把这些感情都向你倾诉出来 而你却把它们都从我身边带走了
...and I expressed them to you, and you took them with you.

1084
00:57:34,935 --> 00:57:36,835
这让我感到孤独！ 好像爱情再也不属于我一样！
It made me feel cold, like love wasn't for me.

1085
00:57:37,004 --> 00:57:39,734
我不相信，我不相信
I don't believe that. I don't believe that.

1086
00:57:41,008 --> 00:57:45,240
你知道吗？ 对我来说，现实和爱基本就是矛盾的
You know what? Reality and love are almost contradictory for me.

1087
00:57:45,412 --> 00:57:49,712
非常可笑，我每一个以前的男友 他们都结婚了
It's funny, every single of my exes, they're now married.

1088
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:52,784
男人约我出去，然后我们分手 然后他们就结婚了.
Men go out with me, we break up, and then they get married.

1089
00:57:52,953 --> 00:57:56,445
之后之后他们打电话感谢我 教会了他们什么是爱
And later they call me to thank me for teaching them what love is...

1090
00:57:56,657 --> 00:57:59,125
...教会了他们去关心跟尊重女人！
...and that I taught them to care and respect women.

1091
00:57:59,292 --> 00:58:01,692
- 我想我也是那些男人中的一个 - 你知道吗，我真想杀了他们！
- I think I'm one of those. - I want to kill them!

1092
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:05,524
他们为什么不向我求婚？ 我也许会拒绝，但至少他们也应该问我啊！
Why didn't they ask me? I would have said no, but they could have asked!

1093
00:58:05,699 --> 00:58:09,465
但我知道这是我的错 因为我总觉得他们不是我的如意郎君
I know it's my fault because I never felt it was the right man.

1094
00:58:09,703 --> 00:58:12,900
从来没有，但如意的人又是什么呢？ 你的真爱？
Never. But what does it mean, the right man, the love of your life?

1095
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:16,406
这种想法简直可笑，说什么我们只有 找到了另一半人生才是完整的
The concept is absurd. We can only be complete with another person.

1096
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:18,976
- 这太可恶了，不是吗？ - 我能说两句吗？
- It's evil, right? - Can I talk?

1097
00:58:19,179 --> 00:58:22,580
我想我是伤心过太多次了 然后又恢复了
I guess I've been heartbroken too many times and then I recovered.

1098
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:25,377
于是现在，从一开始，我就不愿意付出努力
So now, you know, from the starts, I make no effort.

1099
00:58:25,552 --> 00:58:28,316
- 因为我知道一定不能成功 - 你不能这样
- I know it's not gonna work out. - You can't do that.

1100
00:58:28,555 --> 00:58:30,420
你不可以只是为了避免受伤害
You can't live trying to avoid pain...

1101
00:58:30,624 --> 00:58:32,421
- 就付出... - 好啦，我决定了
...at the expense... - Those are words.

1102
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:34,059
我要离你远远的
I've gotta get away from you.

1103
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:36,388
- 停车，我要下车！ - 不，别下车
- Stop the car, I wanna get out. - No, don't...

1104
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:38,461
- 你知道在你身边... - 请继续讲...
- Keep talking. - It's being around you.

1105
00:58:38,632 --> 00:58:40,998
别碰我！你知道吗，我要叫辆计程车...
Don't touch me, you know. I want to get on a cab.

1106
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,400
（法语）请停车，先生

1107
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,700
（法语）过了红绿灯您就停，我去坐地铁
No, don't. No, no, keep going.

1108
00:58:43,737 --> 00:58:46,137
别，别停，继续开...

1109
00:58:46,306 --> 00:58:49,901
听我说，我真的很高兴... 谢谢你，请继续开...
Listen, I'm just so happy... Thank you, just keep going.

1110
00:58:50,077 --> 00:58:51,772
好啦
All right.

1111
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:56,844
听我说，我真得很高兴 能跟你在一起
Look, I'm just so happy, all right, to be with you.

1112
00:58:57,017 --> 00:59:00,418
我真得很高兴你没有忘记我
I am. I'm so glad you didn't forget about me, okay?

1113
00:59:00,587 --> 00:59:03,283
是的，我没有，而这吓坏我了，知道吗？
No, I didn't. And it pisses me off, okay?

1114
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:07,153
你到巴黎来，给我带来浪漫，但却结了婚
You come here to Paris, all romantic, and married.

1115
00:59:07,327 --> 00:59:08,794
去死吧你！
Okay? Screw you.

1116
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,995
不要误会我，我并没有想要占有你
Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to get you.

1117
00:59:12,165 --> 00:59:14,633
我只不过想把自己嫁出去
I mean, all I need is a married man.

1118
00:59:15,268 --> 00:59:18,601
这个问题很复杂 这甚至不仅仅是关于你
There's been so much water under the bridge, it's not even about you.

1119
00:59:18,772 --> 00:59:21,240
还有那段过去的时光， 那段永远不会再回来的时光！
It's about that moment in time that's forever gone.

1120
00:59:21,441 --> 00:59:24,342
你说了这么多，但你却根本不记得我们做过爱
You say that, but you didn't even remember having sex, so...

1121
00:59:24,511 --> 00:59:27,378
我当然记得
Of course I remembered.

1122
00:59:28,515 --> 00:59:30,949
- 你记得？ - 没错！
- You did? - Yes.

1123
00:59:31,118 --> 00:59:34,485
- 女人总喜欢这么掩饰自己 - 是吗？
- Women pretend things like that. - They do?

1124
00:59:34,688 --> 00:59:38,647
我应该说什么呢？ 说我记得公园里的红酒...
What was I supposed to say? That I remember the wine in the park...

1125
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:42,317
...说我们我们一起看着星星落下太阳升起！
...and us looking up at the stars fading away as the sun came up?

1126
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:45,863
我们做了两次爱，你这混蛋！
We had sex twice, you idiot!

1127
00:59:47,267 --> 00:59:51,033
好啦，你知道吗 我真得很高兴看到你
All right, you know what, I'm just happy to see you.

1128
00:59:51,271 --> 00:59:54,672
即使你已变得易怒和神经质
Even if you've become an angry, manic-depressive activist...

1129
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:58,333
我还是很喜欢你 我还是愿意跟你待在一起！
...I still like you, I still enjoy being around you.

1130
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:03,381
我也是，对不起，我不知道怎么了，我只是...
And I feel the same. I'm sorry. I don't know what happened, I just...

1131
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:06,018
- 我需要发泄，我... - 没事
- I had to let it all out. - Don't worry about it.

1132
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:08,814
我的感情生活太不顺利了
I'm so miserable in my love life, in my relationship.

1133
01:00:08,989 --> 01:00:12,152
所以我总是装作...好像我不在意它
I always act as... Like, you know, I'm detached.

1134
01:00:12,325 --> 01:00:15,488
但我真得痛不欲生 因为麻木而痛不欲生
But I'm dying inside. I'm dying because I'm so numb.

1135
01:00:15,662 --> 01:00:19,393
我不能感受到伤心和兴奋 我也不会感到苦涩，我只是...
I don't feel pain or excitement, I'm not even bitter, I'm just...

1136
01:00:19,566 --> 01:00:22,228
你以为只有你痛不欲生吗？
You think you're the one dying inside?

1137
01:00:22,402 --> 01:00:26,600
我的生活每时每刻全像是地狱
My life is 24/7 bad.

1138
01:00:26,807 --> 01:00:28,104
- 对不起... - 不要...
- I'm sorry. - No, no.

1139
01:00:28,308 --> 01:00:31,209
我唯一的快乐就是跟我儿子出去
I mean, the only happiness I get is when I'm out with my son.

1140
01:00:31,378 --> 01:00:33,039
我去找了婚姻咨询
I've been to marriage counseling...

1141
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:35,841
我做了我从来没想过我会做的事
...I've done things I never thought I would have to do.

1142
01:00:36,016 --> 01:00:38,951
我点了蜡烛，买了自助读物，女性内衣...
I've lit candles, bought self-help books, lingerie.

1143
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:41,519
- 蜡烛有用吗？ - 有个鬼用！
- Did the candles help? - Hell, no.

1144
01:00:41,688 --> 01:00:44,179
我没法用她想要的方式爱她
I don't love her the way she needs to be loved...

1145
01:00:44,357 --> 01:00:48,794
...我甚至根本看不到我们的未来 但当我看到我的小儿子
...and I don't even see a future for us, but then I look at my little boy...

1146
01:00:48,962 --> 01:00:52,363
...坐在桌子的对面 我就觉得我愿意承受一切折磨...
...sitting across from me, and I think I'd suffer any torture...

1147
01:00:52,532 --> 01:00:54,898
...只要能跟他一起度过 他生命中的每一刻
...to be with him for all the minutes of his life.

1148
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:56,933
我一刻也不想缺
I don't want to miss out on one.

1149
01:00:57,103 --> 01:01:01,437
但是我的家里没有欢笑，没有快乐
But then, there's no joy or laughter in my home, you know?

1150
01:01:01,608 --> 01:01:05,305
- 我不希望他在这样的环境中长大 - 没有欢笑？那可太糟了
- I don't want him growing up in that. - No laughter? That's terrible.

1151
01:01:05,478 --> 01:01:07,412
我的父母在一起已经有35年了
My parents have been together 35 years...

1152
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:09,913
而即使他们吵架之后，他们还会笑得一样开心
...and even when they fight they end up laughing.

1153
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:13,883
我不想变成那种人 在52岁时离了婚...
I don't want to be one of those people who are getting divorced at 52...

1154
01:01:14,054 --> 01:01:18,457
...落着泪，承认从来就没有爱过自己的伴侣...
...and falling down into tears, admitting they never really loved their spouse...

1155
01:01:18,625 --> 01:01:23,653
...感觉自己的生活好像 完全被吸尘器吸走一样，一片空虚
...and they feel their life has been sucked up into a vacuum cleaner.

1156
01:01:23,897 --> 01:01:27,458
我也想拥有美好的生活 我也希望她拥有美好的生活
You know, I want a great life. I want her to have a great life...

1157
01:01:27,667 --> 01:01:29,862
这是她应得的！
...she deserves that.

1158
01:01:30,070 --> 01:01:33,403
但现在我们只是假装维系着婚姻，责任
But we're just living in the pretense of a marriage, responsibility...

1159
01:01:33,573 --> 01:01:37,566
...过着那种人们觉得你该过的日子
...you know, all these ideas of how people are supposed to live.

1160
01:01:39,279 --> 01:01:43,147
然后，我...我做了一个梦
But then I... I have these dreams...

1161
01:01:44,651 --> 01:01:46,016
什么梦？
What dreams?

1162
01:01:46,186 --> 01:01:49,678
我做了一个梦
I have these dreams, you know, that...

1163
01:01:50,156 --> 01:01:52,147
...梦见我站在月台上
...I'm standing on a platform...

1164
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:56,588
...而你不停的坐火车经过
...and you keep going by on a train...

1165
01:01:56,763 --> 01:02:01,166
...你就是不停的经过，经过，经过
...and you go by, and you go by, and you go by, you go by.

1166
01:02:01,334 --> 01:02:03,199
然后我被吓醒，浑身冷汗
And I wake up with the fucking sweats.

1167
01:02:03,403 --> 01:02:05,667
然后我又做了一个梦...
And then I have this other dream...

1168
01:02:05,906 --> 01:02:09,706
...梦见你怀孕了，在床上躺在我身边，一丝不挂...
...where you're pregnant in bed beside me naked...

1169
01:02:09,943 --> 01:02:13,709
...而我非常非常想要抚摸你，但你跟我说不要， 然后你就把头别过去
...and I want so badly to touch you, but you tell me not to and you look away.

1170
01:02:13,914 --> 01:02:18,374
然后我... 我还是抚摸了你...
And I... And I touch you anyway...

1171
01:02:18,551 --> 01:02:23,011
...摸你的脚踝那里，你的皮肤是那样的柔软 使得我在哭泣中醒来
...right on your ankle, and your skin is so soft that I wake up in sobs, all right?

1172
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:27,226
我的妻子就坐在那里，看着我 我却觉得她离我万里之遥
My wife is there looking at me, and I feel I'm a million miles from her.

1173
01:02:27,427 --> 01:02:31,454
我知道那不对劲，我...
And I know that there's something wrong, that I...

1174
01:02:31,631 --> 01:02:33,622
天啊！我不能再这样活下去了...
God, that I can't keep living like this...

1175
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,325
...爱的意义一定不仅仅是责任
...that there's gotta be more to love than commitment.

1176
01:02:36,536 --> 01:02:39,334
但然后我又想 也许我已经不相信...
But then I think that I might have given up...

1177
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:41,406
...浪漫的爱情了
...on the whole idea of romantic love.

1178
01:02:41,574 --> 01:02:44,873
我可能早已经不信了
That I might have put it to bed that...

1179
01:02:45,045 --> 01:02:47,809
自从那天我在那里没有见你
That day when you weren't there.

1180
01:02:47,981 --> 01:02:50,711
我想，我可能就开始消沉了
You know, I think I might have done that.

1181
01:02:51,985 --> 01:02:54,180
你为什么要和我说这些？
Why are you telling me all this?

1182
01:02:55,055 --> 01:02:59,253
对不起，我不知道 我...我应该...
I'm sorry. I don't know. I'm... I should...

1183
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:02,394
我不应该说的
I shouldn't have.

1184
01:03:02,562 --> 01:03:04,154
你知道，太奇怪了
You know, it's so weird.

1185
01:03:04,331 --> 01:03:08,358
人们总是觉得自己是唯一痛苦的人
People think they are the only one going through tough times.

1186
01:03:08,568 --> 01:03:12,868
当我读那些文章的时候 我觉得你的生活是完美的
I mean, when I read the article, I thought your life was perfect.

1187
01:03:13,173 --> 01:03:17,075
有太太，孩子，出版了自己的作品
A wife, a kid, published author.

1188
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:21,078
现在看来你的生活比我还糟！
But your personal life is more of a mess than mine.

1189
01:03:21,247 --> 01:03:23,579
对不起！
I'm sorry.

1190
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:26,203
起码有些方面还过得去
Well, I'm glad it's good for something.

1191
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:26,900
（法语）噢，先生，就是那儿！

1192
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,600
（法语）把车停到那个通道里就行了

1193
01:03:29,589 --> 01:03:32,854
- 这里就是你住的地方？ - 没错
- This is where you live? - Yeah.

1194
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:37,924
那现在看到看到我的生活比你还糟 觉得舒服点了吧？
So you're just relieved that I'm in even more deep shit than you are?

1195
01:03:38,098 --> 01:03:39,963
是的，你让我感觉好多了
Yes, you've made me feel better.

1196
01:03:40,133 --> 01:03:42,294
哦，那就好，我很高兴...
Oh, good, I'm glad.

1197
01:03:42,502 --> 01:03:44,936
不，我真的希望你的生活可以更好
No, I really wish you the best.

1198
01:03:45,105 --> 01:03:48,768
我不会因为自己无法有良好的感情 或是美好的家庭
It's not because I'm incapable of having a good relationship or a family...

1199
01:03:48,942 --> 01:03:51,069
就想要别人也跟我一样不开心
...that I wish everyone to be doomed like me.

1200
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:53,610
我知道你总有一天会成为... 一个伟大的母亲的！
I'm sure you'd make... Be a great mom someday.

1201
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:55,270
- 真的？你真的这么认为？ - 没错
- Really? You think so? - Yeah...

1202
01:03:55,448 --> 01:03:58,576
只要服一些抗忧郁药，你就行了！
...a few antidepressants, you know, you'll do great.

1203
01:03:59,386 --> 01:04:02,219
- 喊停！ - 停！
- Okay, say stop. - Stop.

1204
01:04:02,655 --> 01:04:05,385
- 好啦 - 准备好了吗？好啦
- Okay. - You ready? Okay.

1205
01:04:15,535 --> 01:04:19,733
- 我想试一下 - 什么？
- So I want to try something. - What?

1206
01:04:22,175 --> 01:04:26,544
我想看看你是会保持原样还是会融化
I want to see if you stay together or if you dissolve into molecules.

1207
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:29,514
我融化了吗？
How am I doing?

1208
01:04:29,682 --> 01:04:31,616
保持原样！
Still here.

1209
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:33,946
很好，我喜欢住在这儿
Good. I like being here.

1210
01:04:37,824 --> 01:04:39,416
这是你的公寓吗？
Is this your apartment?

1211
01:04:39,592 --> 01:04:41,287
不，我住在那里
No, I live down there.

1212
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:43,691
- 那里？ - 是的
- Down there? - Yeah.

1213
01:04:43,863 --> 01:04:46,354
先生，我想送她进家门
Monsieur, I'm gonna walk her to her door.

1214
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:52,000
（法语）他要送我进家门

1215
01:04:55,442 --> 01:04:56,773
太不可思议了！
This is incredible.

1216
01:04:56,943 --> 01:04:59,639
- 这就是你住的地方？ - 是的

- 那告诉我.... - 什么？
- So tell me... - What?

1219
01:05:06,886 --> 01:05:08,547
你讲的那些你的梦，是真的吗？
Is it all true about your dreams...

1220
01:05:08,721 --> 01:05:11,485
还是只是为了骗我上床？
...or did you say that to hopefully get in my pants?

1221
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:13,216
当然只是骗你上床啦！
I said that to get in your pants.

1222
01:05:13,393 --> 01:05:15,884
- 这是我的惯用伎俩 - 哦，有用吗？
- I use that all the time. - Oh, okay. Does it work?

1223
01:05:16,129 --> 01:05:18,996
恩，有时候
You know. Sometimes.

1224
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:23,658
这是我的猫咪，哦，太可爱了 看看它
Here's my kitty. Oh, so cute. Look at him.

1225
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:25,668
你知道我喜欢他的什么吗？
You know what I love about this cat?

1226
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:28,137
每天早上我带他下来
Every morning I bring him to the courtyard...

1227
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:33,040
...每一个早晨，他都会像是第一次来到这个院子一样！
...and every single morning he looks at everything like it was the first time.

1228
01:05:33,213 --> 01:05:37,309
每个角落，每棵树，每棵植物
Every corner, every tree, every plant.

1229
01:05:37,484 --> 01:05:39,918
都用他可爱的小鼻子去闻闻
Smells everything with his little cute nose.

1230
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:44,181
我太喜欢他了！

1233
01:05:51,531 --> 01:05:53,931
- 怎么了？ - 听起来像共产党员
- What? - Commie.

1234
01:05:55,401 --> 01:05:58,393
不，“奇”在阿根廷是用来打招呼用的！
No, "che" in Argentina means "hey. "

1235
01:05:58,571 --> 01:06:01,005
- 真的？ - 是的
- Okay. - Yes.

1236
01:06:01,174 --> 01:06:04,905
哦，宝贝，哦，好啊，好啊

我们晚上有个聚餐！超好玩的！
We're having a little party. It's so much fun.

1238
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,300

1239
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:16,300
（法语）塔布雷色拉

1240
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:18,400

01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:23,400
（法语）你好

1242
01:06:19,349 --> 01:06:20,587
（法语）你好

1243
01:06:21,966 --> 01:06:23,718
- So... - So.

1244
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,900
（法语）这是谁？帅哥啊！

1245
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,900
- （法语）他和我们共进晚餐吗？ - （法语）不，他要赶飞机

1246
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:31,900
（法语）可惜他尝不到我的拿手菜了

1247
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:33,400
（法语）他为什么不留下吃晚饭？

1248
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:35,600
（法语）他不喜欢你的短裤！

1249
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:22,300
（法语）我的短裤怎么了？

1250
01:06:22,262 --> 01:06:23,001
- 那.... - 那

1251
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:44,740
你知道吗？我在想 你可以唱一首你的歌给我听吗？
You know what? I was thinking, would you play me one of your songs?

1252
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:47,079
- 你会错过你的班机的！ - 不，不会的！
- You're gonna miss your flight. - I won't.

1253
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:50,154
我坐在候机厅也只不过是读一个小时的报纸
I'm gonna be in the airport for over an hour, reading...

1254
01:06:50,323 --> 01:06:53,258
...所以还是听你唱一首歌给我听吧
...wishing you'd played me one of your songs.

1255
01:06:53,459 --> 01:06:55,654
一首？ 好吧，不过很短的
One song? Okay, but quickly.

1256
01:06:55,828 --> 01:06:57,625
好的
Okay.

1257
01:07:02,969 --> 01:07:06,200
我太喜欢这老楼梯了
God, I love these old staircases.

1258
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:46,775
- 拿着！ - 什么，让我来？
- Hold this. - What, for me?

1259
01:07:46,946 --> 01:07:48,971
嘿，小家伙
Hey there, buddy.

1260
01:07:50,049 --> 01:07:52,142
奇

01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:07,396
- 你想喝点茶吗？ - 好啊
- Would you like some tea? - Yeah, sure.

1262
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:09,527

1263
01:08:10,536 --> 01:08:14,028
- 甘菊茶好吗？ - 恩，很好
- Is chamomile okay? - Yeah. Great.

1264
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:16,471
- （法语）谢谢！ - 乱？（谐音）
<i>- Merci. - Messy?</i>

1265

- 你觉得我的房间很乱？ - 不不不，我是说谢谢
<i>- You think my apartment is messy? - No, no. Merci.</i>

01:08:20,546 --> 01:08:24,073
- （法语）非常感谢 - 哦，谢谢
<i>- Merci beaucoup. - Ah, merci.</i>

1267
01:08:24,284 --> 01:08:28,015
我想告诉你，你的法语进步很多
I meant to tell you, your French has improved a lot.

1268
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:29,518
- 真的吗？ - 没错！
- Really? - Yeah.

1269
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:32,283
你已经完全掌握这门语言了
Yeah, you've really mastered the language.

1270
01:08:33,059 --> 01:08:36,187
好吧，那你想要唱哪首歌？
All right, all right, what song are you gonna play me?

1271
01:08:38,398 --> 01:08:41,333
不行，我唱不了，这太丢人了
No, I can't. It's too embarrassing. It's been...

1272
01:08:41,501 --> 01:08:45,198
哇！不行！我这么费劲上来 就是为了这个，你不能这样坑我
Whoa. No way. No way. I came up here, you cannot crap out on me now.

1273
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:47,396
就一首，随便那首都行
One song. Anything will be great.

1274
01:08:47,607 --> 01:08:49,404
但你会笑我的
But listen, you're gonna laugh at me.

1275
01:08:49,575 --> 01:08:51,065
- 你这么觉得？ - 是的！
- You think so? - Yes.

1276
01:08:51,311 --> 01:08:53,302
放心，我不会的
I doubt it.

1277
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:57,448
好吧
Okay.

1278
01:08:57,617 --> 01:09:00,017
你想听什么？我有...
What do you want to hear? I have...

1279
01:09:00,186 --> 01:09:02,518
我有三首英文歌
I have three songs in English.

1280
01:09:02,689 --> 01:09:04,054
一首是唱我的猫的
One's about my cat...

1281
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:08,284
...一首是唱我的前男友， 呃，前前男友...
...one's about my ex-boyfriend... Well, ex-ex-boyfriend...

1282
01:09:08,461 --> 01:09:10,952
...还有一首是....
...and there's one about...

1283
01:09:11,364 --> 01:09:14,731
是首华尔兹
Well, it's just a little waltz.

1284
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:17,028
华尔兹？
A waltz? Yeah.

1285
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:19,363
- 那就唱华尔兹吧 - 好吧
- Play the waltz. - Right.

1286
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:21,972
我已经很久没弹吉他了，你确定你想听吗？
I haven't played it in a while. You sure?

1287
01:09:25,345 --> 01:09:26,869
当然
Okay.

1288
01:09:27,613 --> 01:09:29,911
好吧，华尔兹
All right, the waltz.

1289
01:09:42,128 --> 01:09:46,622
让我唱首华尔兹
<i>Let me sing you a waltz</i>

1290
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:51,566
无从讲起，从我的心底
<i>Out of nowhere, out of my thoughts</i>

1291
01:09:51,738 --> 01:09:56,266
让我唱首华尔兹
<i>Let me sing you a waltz</i>

1292
01:09:56,442 --> 01:10:00,310
唱那次一夜缠绵
<i>About this one-night stand</i>

1293
01:10:01,414 --> 01:10:07,114
那晚，你是我的
<i>You were, for me, that night</i>

1294
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:13,191
你是我生命中的全部梦想
<i>Everything I always dreamt of in life</i>

1295
01:10:13,393 --> 01:10:16,920
但你已经不在了
<i>But now you're gone</i>

1296
01:10:17,096 --> 01:10:21,328
你去了很远的地方
<i>You are far-gone</i>

1297
01:10:22,335 --> 01:10:26,999
你那的雨中小岛
<i>All the way to your island of rain</i>

1298
01:10:27,173 --> 01:10:33,043
对你来说，那只是一夜情
<i>It was, for you, just a one-night thing</i>

1299
01:10:33,212 --> 01:10:36,181
对我来说却远远不止
<i>But you were much more to me</i>

1300
01:10:36,416 --> 01:10:39,112
我想让你知道
<i>Just so you know</i>

1301
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:43,145
我不管别人怎样说
<i>I don't care what they say</i>

1302
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:48,282
我知道你对我的意义
<i>I know what you meant For me that day</i>

1303
01:10:48,461 --> 01:10:53,296
我只想再来一次
<i>I just want another try</i>

1304
01:10:53,466 --> 01:10:58,460
我只想再来一夜
<i>I just want another night</i>

1305
01:10:59,705 --> 01:11:05,666
即使这看起来毫无意义
<i>Even if it doesn't seem quite right</i>

1306
01:11:05,878 --> 01:11:09,871
但你对我来说
<i>You meant, for me, much more</i>

1307
01:11:10,049 --> 01:11:14,383
要比任何人都更重要
<i>Than anyone I've met before</i>

1308
01:11:14,554 --> 01:11:20,891
和你共度的一夜啊，小杰西
<i>One single night with you, little Jesse</i>

1309
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:26,191
比得上和他人的一千个夜晚
<i>Is worth a thousand with anybody</i>

1310
01:11:27,233 --> 01:11:30,600
我没有痛苦，亲亲
<i>I have no bitterness, my sweet</i>

1311
01:11:30,970 --> 01:11:36,033
我永远不会忘记这一夜缠绵
<i>I'll never forget this one-night thing</i>

1312
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:42,341
即使明天我在他人怀中
<i>Even tomorrow, in other arms</i>

1313
01:11:42,515 --> 01:11:48,545
我的心还会随你而去，直到生命尽头
<i>My heart will stay yours until I die</i>

1314
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:57,526
让我唱一首华尔兹
<i>Let me sing you a waltz</i>

1315
01:11:57,697 --> 01:12:02,725
无从讲起，从我的心底
<i>Out of nowhere, out of my blues</i>

1316
01:12:02,902 --> 01:12:07,862
让我唱一首华尔兹
<i>Let me sing you a waltz</i>

1317
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:13,239
唱那可爱的一夜情
<i>About this lovely one-night stand</i>

1318
01:12:30,329 --> 01:12:33,958
- 不要停，再来一首，求你了 - 不行，说好了的！
- No, one more! Please, please. - No! It was our deal.

1319
01:12:34,166 --> 01:12:36,634
一首，就一首，别，别
One... One song. No, no, no.

1320
01:12:36,836 --> 01:12:39,396
你可以喝完你的茶再...
You can have your tea and then...

1321
01:12:44,810 --> 01:12:47,176
- 好吧，我问你个问题 - 什么？
- All right, let me ask you one question. - What?

1322
01:12:47,346 --> 01:12:50,645
你是不是每次不管谁来 就在歌词里换个名字？
Do you just plug that name in for every guy that comes up here?

1323
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:52,581
当然了
Yes, of course.

1324
01:12:52,752 --> 01:12:56,813
你以为呢？我是写给你的？你疯了吗？
What do you think, that I wrote the song about you? Are you nuts?

1325
01:13:01,193 --> 01:13:03,593
这是你吗？小对眼塞琳？
Is this you? Little cross-eyed Celine?

1326
01:13:03,763 --> 01:13:06,323
- 是的，那张很好笑 - 可爱
- Yes. That's funny. - Cute.

1327
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:11,136
- 这就是你的祖母？ - 是的
- Is that your grandmother? - Yeah.

1328
01:13:12,872 --> 01:13:14,965
哇
Oh, wow.

1329
01:13:15,341 --> 01:13:18,435
- 你要加点蜂蜜吗？ - 好的
- You want some honey? - Yeah, sure.

1330
01:14:08,127 --> 01:14:10,425
你听过尼娜·西蒙的演唱会吗？
Did you ever see Nina Simone in concert?

1331
01:14:10,630 --> 01:14:13,155
没有，不敢相信她已经不在了
No, I never did. I can't believe she's gone.

1332
01:14:13,499 --> 01:14:14,989
我知道，太让人伤心了
I know, it's so sad.

1333
01:14:16,135 --> 01:14:17,568
谢谢
Thanks.

1334
01:14:17,737 --> 01:14:19,728
真热
It's hot.

1335
01:14:21,841 --> 01:14:24,674
我听过她两次演唱会
I saw her twice in concert.

1336
01:14:25,277 --> 01:14:27,575
她真棒！
She was so great.

1337
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:30,772
这是她的歌里我最喜欢的几首之一
That's one of my favorite songs of hers.

1338
01:14:46,666 --> 01:14:47,963
她太棒了！
She was so great.

1339
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:52,200
她在演唱会里太有趣了
She was so funny in concert too.

1340
01:14:52,371 --> 01:14:56,535
她会...她会在一首歌唱到一半时的时候
She would... She would be right in the middle of a song and then...

1341
01:14:56,709 --> 01:14:58,574
...你知道吗，停下来...
...you know, stop...

1342
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:02,805
...从钢琴边起身，一直走到舞台边上
...and walk from the piano all the way to the edge of the stage.

1343
01:15:02,982 --> 01:15:05,314
像这样，非常慢的
Like, really slowly.

1344
01:15:08,287 --> 01:15:11,586
然后她开始对观众中的某人说话
And she'd start talking to someone in the audience.

1345
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:15,124
哦，耶，哦，耶
"Oh, yeah, baby. Oh, yeah.

1346
01:15:15,895 --> 01:15:18,125
我也爱你
I love you too. "

1347
01:15:18,564 --> 01:15:23,001
然后她又走回去，不急不忙的，
And then she'd walk back. Take her time, no hurry, you know.

1348
01:15:23,202 --> 01:15:26,660
她的大屁股真可爱
She had that big, cute ass.

1349
01:15:26,839 --> 01:15:28,397
她就这么慢慢挪着
She would move.

1350
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:34,944
然后就走回钢琴旁再唱一段
And then she would go back to the piano and play some more, you know.

1351
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:38,110
然后她会，我也不知道...
And then she would, I don't know...

1352
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:40,775
...一首歌唱了一半又唱另外一首
...just start another song in the middle of another.

1353
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:44,753
你懂吗，好像，又停下，然后这样
You know, like, stop again, and be like:

1354
01:15:44,924 --> 01:15:48,917
那边那位，你能挪挪那电扇吗
"You over there, can you move that fan.

1355
01:15:49,829 --> 01:15:51,956
你真可爱
You're cute.

1356
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:14,976
哦，耶
Oh, yeah. "

1357
01:16:18,524 --> 01:16:22,824
宝贝，你会错过你的班机的
Baby, you are gonna miss that plane.

1358
01:16:24,130 --> 01:16:26,030
我知道
I know.
