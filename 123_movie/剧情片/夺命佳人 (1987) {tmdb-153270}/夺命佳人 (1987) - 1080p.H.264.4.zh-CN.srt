 ? Caroline laughs and it's raining all day ?

7
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:04,196
 ? She loves to be one of the girls ?

8
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:07,699
 ? She lives in the place in the side of our lives ?

9
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:11,670
 ? Where nothing is ever put straight ?

10
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:14,206
 ? She turns herself round and she smiles and she says ?

11
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:18,410
 ? "This is it, that's the end of the joke" ?

12
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:21,647
 ? And loses herself in her dreaming and sleep ?

13
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:25,350
 ? And her lovers walk through in their cloaks ?

14
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:27,786
 ? She's... ?

15
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:31,323

00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,767
老爸 7点半了!
 Daddy, it's 7:30!

19
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:44,536
爸 起床了!

20
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,405
早啊 爸爸 快起床
 Morning, Daddy. Come on, wake up.

21
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:49,341
快点起床
 Wake up. Come on, wake up.

22
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:50,776
 Come on, wake up.

23
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:53,245
- 这是你的咖啡 - 我在哪儿?
 There's your coffee right there.

24
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:55,314
Where am I?

25
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:57,382
把这个喝了
 Here. I want you to drink this.

26
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:59,118
接着洗洗澡穿好衣服 你的衣服在这
 Then I want you to take a shower.

27
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,319
 Then I want you to get dressed.

28
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:01,487
之后去找那女人面试 你答应过今天去的
 There are your clothes right there.

29
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:03,222
 And then I want you to go see the woman

30
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:03,822
 about the job, okay?

31
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:05,524
我知道 要不是你在我耳边嗦 我能做点什么?
 Today, you promised. I know.

32
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:07,626
What would I do without you nagging me

33
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:08,327
你真的想让我回答?
all the time?

34
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:09,495
 You really want me to answer that?

35
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:13,899
God, I been getting in kind of late lately.

36
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:16,719
我最近回来的晚 我们没多少机会聊天

37
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:16,435
We haven't had a chance to talk, or anything.

38
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:17,569
别担心 也没多少可说的
 Well, don't worry about it.

39
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:18,837
There hasn't been a lot to say.

40
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:22,241
- 你好吧 - 没事
 Is everything all right with you?

41
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:23,342
- 学校还好吧 - 不好 一直就这样呗
 Yeah.

42
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:24,576
Is school good?

43
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,645
 No, but it never is.

44
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,480
- 有人邀请你去毕业舞会吗? - 还没有
 Have you been asked

45
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,782
to the prom? No.

46
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:34,620
上次我说你美呆了是什么时候
When was the last time I told you

47
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:35,921
昨天吧
how beautiful you are?

48
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,823
 About yesterday.

49
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:40,292
- 转过去 - 干嘛
Hey, hey, turn around.

50
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:41,760
让我看看你的美衫
 What? You know what.

51
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:43,495
Come here, let me see this outfit.

52
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,631
- 这是你最新的创作? - 就是它了
Is this your latest creation?

53
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:46,698
天哪 花了多少钱
 Uh-huh.

54
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,432
 This is it.

55
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:48,500
My God, what did that cost you?

56
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:53,372
二手鞋15块 其他是我自己做的
 Oh, about $15 for the shoes, secondhand and I made the rest.

57
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:55,908
太给力了
 Unbelievable.

58
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,411
我觉得这玩意你也能利用利用
I was thinking, maybe, that, um,

59
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:01,513
 you could do something with this.

60
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,515
- 这里加点花边… - 快起来
Maybe put some ruffles up here.

61
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:04,550
我是说真的 这对我意味重大
 Come on, get up!

62
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:05,484
 Really, I mean it.

63
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:06,351
我对我现在的生活满意极了
 This means a lot to me.

64
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,819
 Honey, I'm perfectly happy

65
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:08,754
 with what I'm doing.

66
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:12,291
对兼职满意极了?
 You're perfectly happy with part-time work?

67
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:13,926
- 不 所以我才要起床 - 好了 给你做点早饭
 No.

68
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:15,894
 That's why I'm getting up.

69
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:16,528
 Okay.

70
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,665
 I'll make some breakfast.

71
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,676
我起来了
 I'm up!

72
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:53,465
 ?

73
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:54,967
- 嗨 布兰 - 凯特 你好吗
 Hi, Blane.

74
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:56,535
- 很好 你呢 - 不错
Hi, Kate, how you doing?

75
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:59,338
 Fine. How are you? Good.

76
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:10,916
早啊 欢迎开始新一天的高等教育
'Morning!

77
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,452
Welcome to another day of higher education.

78
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:14,820
- 唐老鸭 你好吗 - 我在这个垃圾场里混的还不赖
 Hi, Duckie, how are you?

79
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:18,557
 Mm, not all that bad, considering I'm in this dump.

80
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,293
你今天穿的真是像火山一样爆发
You know, this is a really volcanic ensemble

81
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:22,928
- 火山? - 你知道的 火辣 危险…
you're wearing; it's really marvelous.

82
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,696
 Volcanic? Well, you know,

83
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:25,430
- 今天要上课吗 - 我不知道我在情感上有没有准备好
hot, dangerous.

84
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,598
 Are you going to class today?

85
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,734
Well, I don't know if I'm emotionally ready.

86
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:30,902
去上吧 其实不疼的
 Oh, go for it-- it's virtually painless.

87
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:31,970
 (class bell rings) Excuse me.

88
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:34,640
- 我走了 午饭时见 - 好
 I gotta go, okay. I'll see you at lunch. Okay.

89
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:35,741
我打电话给餐厅订位 窗边两位
 Well, listen, I'll call ahead

90
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:37,876
 to the cafeteria and make a couple of reservations.

91
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:39,378
好的
 You know, two by the window.

92
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,379
你不喜欢坐在阳光下 好吧 别的呢
 Sure. Ah, well, no,

93
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:41,913
 you don't like to sit in the sun.

94
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:43,849
我今天可以再次崇拜你吗
 Okay, something else. Uh, listen, may

95
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:46,652
 I admire you again today?

96
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,824
女士们 我可能分身乏力
Ah, ladies, ladies, uh, listen,

97
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,493
让你们俩或其中之一到放假时怀孕
I may be able to work out a deal where either one,

98
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:57,062
or the both of you, could be pregnant by the holidays.

99
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:58,764
What do you say?

100
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:01,967
 (girls snicker)

101
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:06,505
有人认为新政拯救了资本主义体系
 Some argue that The New Deal saved the capitalist system.

102
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:07,039
有证据显示罗斯福政府
 And as evidence

103
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:10,542
 that the Roosevelt administration was trying

104
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:13,745
比起培育社会主义思想
 to avoid excessive governmental power.

105
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:16,581
更尽力避免造成集权政府
 Rather than implant socialism,

106
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:17,616
罗斯福当上总统的第一项法案
 in his first act as president,

107
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:22,020
就是《紧急银行法》
 Mr. Roosevelt enacted The Emergency Banking Act,

108
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:25,891
而且他拒绝国有化
 and he refused to consider nationalization.

109
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:31,363
你衣服是哪买的 旧货市场吗 真好看!
 Where'd you get your clothes,

110
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:34,032
five and dime store?

111
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:36,835
 KATE (snickering): Attractive.

112
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,670
有问题吗 女士们
 Is there a problem,

113
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:39,938
- 没有 - 没有
 ladies?

114
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,739
 No!

115
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:41,573
 KATE: No.

116
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:46,645
Andie, is there something going on between you

117
00:05:43,757 --> 00:05:47,594
安迪 你和这两位女士之间有矛盾吗

118
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:47,813
没有 我没觉得有
and these ladies?

119
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:50,115
 No, not that I'm aware of.

120
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:54,086
我要代表斯楚马妮小姐和亨森小姐道歉
I'd like to apologize on behalf

121
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:55,787
 of Miss Trombley and Miss Hanson.

122
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:58,090
她们在今晚写着
These two young ladies will be thinking of you tonight

123
00:05:58,092 --> 00:06:00,392
我们讲过的这几章的摘要时会想着你的
as they write a summary of the chapters

124
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:02,794
that we've just covered.

125
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,731
太好了!
 Great.

126
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,135
- 不好意思 - 怎么
 Excuse me.

127
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:10,769
 Yeah.

128
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:14,406
 Um, there's nothing wrong with me, I mean, I fine.

129
00:06:12,452 --> 00:06:17,708
我没什么 我很好 摘要的事就算了吧

130
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:16,975
 Can you just forget about the chapter?

131
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:20,846
- 怎么 - 摘要我们写了
 Yes?

132
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:22,948
 We'll take the chapter.

133
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,684
好了 继续讲
Fine. Let's go on.

134
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:29,521
《紧急银行法》
The Emergency Banking Act.

135
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:31,723
回见
 (rock music playing)

136
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,992
 See you guys later.

137
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:37,129
安迪 你太美了
Oh, Andie, you look ravishing.

138
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:38,830
我们过一个月就要毕业了
So, we graduate in a month.

139
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:40,499
我们要不要一起做点神马?
Now, I want to know when it is you

140
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:43,402
and I are going to get together and do something?

141
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:44,069
千万不要
 Try never.

142
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,738
- 我可不仅仅是说性 - 是的
Well, I'm talking about more than sex here.

143
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,706
我喜欢了你四年 你一直理都不理我
 No, you're not.

144
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,541
You know, I've liked you for four years

145
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:50,876
and you treat me like shit, you know.

146
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:53,078
我就不明白了 你有什么毛病
I don't, I don't understand that.

147
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,012
离我车远一点好不?
What's your problem?

148
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:56,681
 Can you get off of my car?

149
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:58,750
这学校的女孩我钓了不少
You know, I've been out

150
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,118
with a lot of girls at this school.

151
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,455
- 你有什么特殊的 - 我有点品味
I don't see what makes you so different.

152
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:05,557
 I have some taste.

153
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,960
你是个贱人
 You're a bitch.

154
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:11,530
你应该去看医生 你的情况可能会越来越糟
 You know, I think you ought to see a doctor,

155
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:12,964
 'cause that condition of yours

156
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:15,634
can get a lot worse.

157
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,909
 (door closes, engine starts)

158
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,584
 (buzz of conversation)

159
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,662
 (staple gun snapping )

160
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:49,000
鼓掌 鼓掌 鼓掌
 Applause, applause, applause.

161
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:51,570
真漂亮 这真是太…
 This is beautiful.

162
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:54,673
现代了
 It's so... modern.

163
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:58,076
是不是美呆了
 I mean, is this fab, or what?

164
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:00,011
很好看
 It's great.

165
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,781
- 我真是非常非常擅长装饰 - 我知道
I'm very, very good at this.

166
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:03,782
我穿这种零售衣服真是浪费
 I know.

167
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:04,749
 Such a waste

168
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:08,520
 that I run a lowly little retail outlet.

169
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:10,121
- 要是搭的好就没问题 - 我床上功夫厉害 我该去当鸡吗?
 No, not if you're good at it.

170
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:14,259
 I'm good in bed. Should I be a whore?

171
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,965
不错
It's great.

172
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,199
 Mmmm.

173
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:23,935
- 你参加过毕业舞会? - 是的
Did you say that you went to your prom?

174
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:25,904
 Yeah, sure.

175
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:27,639
- 好玩不 - 史上最烂
Was it terrible?

176
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:29,040
但本来就是这样的 你应该去 是不是
 It was the worst.

177
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:30,175
 But it's supposed to be,

178
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,176
you know what I mean.

179
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,544
不是必须去的 又不是强制要求
But you have to go, right?

180
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:34,045
 Well, you don't have to.

181
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,146
I mean, it's not a requirement.

182
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:37,782
我有个女朋友就没去
 I have this girl friend who didn't go to hers,

183
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:38,750
她经常会有很不好的感觉 就像丢东西了
 and every once in a while

184
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,018
 she gets this really terrible feeling,

185
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,653
 you know, like something is missing.

186
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:44,256
她检查钱包和钥匙 数数孩子少没少 她会抓狂
She checks her purse, you know, she checks her keys,

187
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:46,591
 she counts her kids, she goes crazy,

188
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:48,760
之后她意识到…
 and then she realizes that...

189
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:50,662
什么都没少
 nothing is missing.

190
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:54,933
她觉得这就是没去毕业舞会的后遗症
She decided it was side effects from skipping the prom.

191
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:56,535
我也不知道 我的一部分让我直接过去就完了
 I don't know, I mean,

192
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,570
 part of me says just go and get it over with,

193
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:01,773
另一部分觉得这是个愚蠢的传统又没有意义
 and this other part of me says it's a stupid tradition

194
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:02,941
你知道
 and what's the point?

195
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:03,708
Well, you know,...

196
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:11,149
生命本来就是个愚蠢的传统
 you could say that life itself is a... stupid tradition,

197
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:15,120
别分析了 去就是了
 but don't analyze it; just go.

198
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:17,689
(lid opening)

199
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,192
放回去!
 Put that back!

200
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,029
- 只差一英季褪俏业难劬! - 半英
 You missed my eye by an inch!

201
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:26,264
 Half an inch.

202
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,767
这里不是公共图书馆 小偷!
IONA: This ain't the public library,

203
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:31,202

205
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:05,770

206
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,740
泰龙 你弄砸了
 IONA: Tyrone, you blow.

207
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:11,009
是的 我在上班 别烦我
 Yeah, I'm working.

208
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:13,111
 Leave me alone!

209
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,013
 (fake laugh)

210
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,214
真刺激!
 That's thrilling!

211
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:19,818
我给你煮饭 给你洗衣服 还跟你睡觉
I cook for you, I do your laundry,

212
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,320
现在你想找人送你上班?
I sleep with you, now you want a ride

213
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:23,855
 to work?!

214
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:27,258
长大点吧!
 Please, grow up!

215
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,195
坐公车…
Take the bus!

216
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:32,897
Take a cab!

217
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:34,199

- 能给我提供点意见吗 - 可能
 Yeah. Yeah.

221
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:40,872
 Can I get your opinion on something here?

222
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:43,241
 Maybe.

223
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,043

 Maybe.

224

 Good. I'll take it.

229

 Okay, um, will that be cash or charge?

230
00:10:58,736 --> 00:11:01,572
好的 现金还是刷卡

231
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,896
美国运通白金卡?
American Express Platinum Card,

 IONA: You know...

236
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:14,172
 every time you go to the john, you lose IQ points.

237
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:17,876
是Walter Mondale(美国副总统)

 (door opens, shop bell tinkles)

248
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:37,228
我的生活中没有束缚 从什么时候开始
IONA: Bondage has no place in my life.

249
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,830
 (bell tinkles, door closes)

250
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:39,297
从我被绑在你的车后座那一夜开始!
Since when?

251
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:43,735
Since I spent the night tied up in the backseat of your car!

252
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:51,943
 ? I stuck my head out of an empty room ?

253
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:58,283
 ? Expectin' nothin' but the new room view ?

254
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:05,156
 ? I swear I saw the future below me ?

255
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:09,894
? Spitting in the face of doom

256
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,797
 ? Yes, so I'm sayin' ?

257

 Well, would you ever consider going out

267
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:34,419
 with somebody that had money?

268
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,223
我觉得这没什么区别 我是说…
 I don't think it makes a difference.

269
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:42,293
 I mean... it's material.

270
00:12:40,337 --> 00:12:42,839
物质而已

271
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:47,198
西蒙! 西蒙!

272
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,832
要是你爸搭上个有钱人回家 你会怎么办?
 Simon!

273
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:51,836
 What would you do if your father came home a rich man?

286
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:12,991
- 我来这儿多久了? - 不知道 有几年了
How long I been coming here?

 I don't know. What are you saying?

296
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:29,073
 What I'm saying is, my girlfriend is in there,

她是女的 还是我朋友 所以她是我女朋友

00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,249
- 你知道这很伤人的! - 我认真地问你个问题
sexually potent kind of guy.

303
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:39,818
You got to know how that hurts.

304
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,586
 Well, let me ask you a question seriously.

305
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:45,089
她知道我不会让你进去 为什么还过来
 Why does she come here, knowing I don't let you in?

306
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:47,458
- 你想想 - 我不知道
 Huh? Think about it.

307
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,961
 I don't know.

308
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:50,562
总之 我给你的建议就是…
 (laughs)

309
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:53,364
 All right, my advice to you is, uh...

310
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,533
甩了她 你不需要她
 dump her, lose her.

311
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:56,467
明白我想表达的意思吗
 You don't need that.

312
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:57,569
 You see what I'm saying?

313
00:13:57,571 --> 00:14:00,505
 You see the point I'm trying to make?

314
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,207
爱情是狗娘 唐老鸭 爱情是狗娘
 Love's a bitch, Duck.

315
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:03,208
 Love's a bitch.

316
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,443
- 这不是真理吧 - 是真理
 Ain't it the truth, ain't it the truth.

317
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,912
- 击掌 - 好的!
 Oh, it's the truth. High five.

318
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:09,180
 All right. Go for it.

319
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,950
抽根烟试试?
Hey, want to try a cigarette? Come on.

320
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:13,051
宝贝 问你个私人问题
Oh, the babe, the babe, the babe.

321
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,620
 Hey, honey, honey, let me ask you a personal question.

322
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:16,855
如果你崇拜唐老鸭 为啥不去个他能进去的地方
 If you worship the Duck,

323
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:19,958
why don't you hang out somewhere he could get in, I mean...

324
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,558
好个骰子人 跟你老婆孩子问好 知道我什么意思吗
Dice, Dice Man, hey!

325
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,860
 Say hello to the wife and kids.

326
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,194
他诵读困难 他理解的东西是反的 他是想说…
 You know what I'm saying? Yeah.

327
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,495
 You see, the Dice Man is dyslexic.

328
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:25,630
 He gets everything backwards.

329
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:27,498
- 好了 唐老鸭 - 你确定?
 What he meant to say was, like, if I worship...

330
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,366
因为他要是惹你不高兴了 我要用他的屁股扫干净整个停车场
It's okay, Duckie.

331
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,268
 Okay, 'cause... you're sure, because if he offended you,

332
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,237
- 我很好 不用担心我 - 好的
 I would gladly clean up this parking lot with his butt.

333
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:33,638
No, I'm fine. Don't worry about it.

334
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,106
- 你来很久了吗? - 没 也就三四个小时而已
 Okay, okay. Were you here long?

335
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,307
 Nah, nah, three, four hours.

336
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,643
玩的开心吗?
 You have a good time, at least?

337
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:39,244
- 很好 现在怎么办 - 上床
Uh-huh.

338
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:41,646
 Oh, good. That's good. Now, what now?

339
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:42,647
你的还是我的?
 Bed.

340
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:44,015
- 我们的? - 有创意
Yours, or mine?

341
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:45,416
Ours? Nice try.

342
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:48,586
好了 送我回家好吗
Okay. Can you at least give me a ride home?

343
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:49,354
好 上车
 Yeah. Get in.

344
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:53,391
Aha. Can I, like, put my head in your lap?

345
00:14:51,383 --> 00:14:53,135
我能把头放在你腿上吗?

346
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,361
我能不能在你开车时头靠着你肩膀
No, wait. Can I rest my head on your shoulder

347
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:57,295
- 上车 唐老鸭 - 好的
and let you steer?

348
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:59,197
 Get in, Duckie. Okay.

349
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,299
 (instrumental rock music playing)

350
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:02,500
 (tape squealing)

351
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,502
这些房子好漂亮 唐老鸭
 (jazzy instrumental rock playing)

352
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,037
 ANDIE: These houses are amazing, Duck.

353
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:09,140
我赚到了第一桶金就给你买一幢 我讨厌这首歌
DUCKIE: Hey, the first million I make, I buy you one.

354
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:09,908
- 好漂亮 - 你想要美 照镜子就好了
I hate this song.

355
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,342
 They're so beautiful! (tape squealing)

356
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:13,144
Hey, you want beauty, look in the mirror.

357
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,178
 (indistinct rock vocal plays)

358
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,147
整张专辑都好恐怖
This whole tape is horrible. (tape squealing)

359
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,148
(instrumental rock music plays)

360
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,917
肯定是荷尔蒙作祟 每首歌都让我想吐
I-I must be going through, like, a hormone thing,

361
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,219
'cause every song I listen to is making me sick.

362
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:23,988
我怎么就找不到一首好歌
I mean, why can't I find a decent song here?

363
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,125
- 这是我最喜欢的 - 你聋了?
That one's my favorite.

364
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:28,393
这座房子!
 Are you deaf?

365
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:29,527
The house!

366
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:32,163
是个不错的小摇篮
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's, that's...

367
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:34,499
That's a nice little, little crib.

368
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:36,634
我想知道那里面是什么样的
 Wonder what it's like inside.

369
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:39,938
那又怎么了
 Well, what-what difference does it make?

370
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,173
知不知道伤心之处是什么
 You know what the really sad thing is, though?

371
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,676
我打赌住在里面的人不会觉得 它有我眼里的一半好看
 I bet the people that live there don't think

372
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:46,444
 it's half as pretty as I do.

373
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,312
要知道 安迪 我…
 You know what I mean?

374
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:48,446
 You know, Andie, I'm just...

375
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,282
他们不像过去那样会写情歌了 我…
They just don't write love songs like they used to.

376
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,650
 It's... I-I... Oh.

377
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:55,253
我现在不高兴了 我晚上要打针 快送我回家
I'm angry about this, you know?

378
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:56,087
 I... this...

379
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,288
 My evening's shot. I...

380
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,557
 Just drive me home now.

381
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,460
 (computer keyboards clicking)

382
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,130
 (woman speaking quietly)

383
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,399
 (indistinct, overlapping chatter)

384
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:11,202
WOMAN: That's... That's right.

385
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:14,205
 (keys clicking, indistinct chatter)

386
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:21,679
 (sighs)

387
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:24,415
 (keys clicking)

388
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,753
 WOMAN: All right.

389
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,249
 (typing)

390
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,257
 (beeping)

391
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:27,812
我过来并不仅仅是想打个招呼
 DUCKIE: <i>Well, the reason I came over--</i>

392
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:30,782
 I mean, other than I've been planning to come by

393
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:31,616
- 我是想跟你谈谈安迪 - 是吗
 and just say hello--

394
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:34,685
 I wanted... I wanted to talk to you about Andie.

395
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:35,286
她是个不可思议的人 你知道的
 Yeah?

396
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:37,555
 I mean, she's... she's an incredible individual.

397
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:38,589
我是说 我会一直陪着她的 不管什么时候 以何种方式 我一直会的
 I mean, you know that.

398
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:39,824
 I mean, I'm there for her!

399
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:41,225
你可以放心 我会一直保护她
 Whenever, however, I'm there.

400
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,194
 You can rest assured that she's covered.

401
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:44,328
你不用担心 因为我唯一的计划
 I don't want you to worry,

402
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,198
 because my only future plans are to make sure

403
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,332
就是要好好照顾她
 that she's taken care of.

404
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:50,735
你真有心 菲尔
 That's nice of you, Phil. (clears throat)

405
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,538
我想娶她
 And I'd like to marry her.

406
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,207
不是今天 但总有那么一天的
 Oh, well, not... you know, not-not today,

407
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:57,508
安迪知道你的想法吗
 but eventually, I figure.

408
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,745
 Well, does Andie know how you feel about this?

409
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:01,479
 Uh...

410
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,181
还没有跟她确认过 现在只是在打基础
 No confirmation on that just yet.

411
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:05,550
 I mean, I'm-I'm laying the groundwork and everything.

412
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:07,452
我指的是房子 食物 基本需求
 You know, I'm thinking in terms of housing,

413
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:10,421
 you know, food, basic needs type of stuff, but

414
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,156
但我会找个好时机的
 I'm picking my moment.

415
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:12,557
- 你能理解吧 - 当然
 Mm-hmm.

416
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,392
 Yeah, I mean, you understand, right?

417
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:15,393
我对某人也是这般的感觉
 (chuckles) Oh, sure.

418
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:19,363
 I felt the same way about somebody myself.

419
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:20,865
女孩?
 Oh, a girl?

420
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,667
是个女孩
 A girl.

421
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,469
 (laughs)

422
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:26,737
我爱上她 就娶了她
 Um, I loved her, and, uh,

423
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:28,773
 I mar... married her.

424
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:31,142
有一天她就这么走了
And, uh, one day she just split.

425
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:34,479
等等 是安迪的妈妈?
 Oh, wait. This was... This was Andie's mom?

426
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:35,680
是的
 Yeah.

427
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:36,781
 Oh.

428
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:37,381
我有三年没见她了 但是…
 (laughs)

429
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:41,219
 So, uh, I haven't seen her in, uh, three years, you know,

430
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:44,555
但我还是一如既往地爱她 知道不
 and, um, but I still love her just as...

431
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:48,392
as much as I ever did, you know?

432
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:50,428
你可以爱安迪 但这并不意味着她就会爱你
I mean, you can love Andie,

433
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,430
but that doesn't mean she's gonna love you back.

434
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:55,533
并不意味着她不会 但是…
 I mean, doesn't mean that she won't, but, uh,

435
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:56,868
我是想说一切顺随天意
 what I'm trying to say is,

436
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,403
 you can't make it happen, you know?

437
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:00,905
成或不成 不在人力
 It either will, or it won't.

438
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:03,407
- 全要看她的内心 - 是的 在心脏血管里
 Uh, it's all in the heart.

439
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:04,809
 Oh, y-yeah, sure.

440
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:05,910
我明白 我上过学
 I... Cardiovascular.

441
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:07,311
 Yeah, I-I understand. I-I...

442
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,480
 I've been to school. (chuckles)

443
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:09,914
 Yeah.

444
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:13,284
我跟个卖真空吸尘器的有约 先走了
 Well, uh, I got an appointment with a vacuum cleaner.

445
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:13,818
 Got to go.

446
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:18,256
你真是家居狂人
 Hey, you're on a whole home improvement jag here, aren't you?

447
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:19,624
- 是的 扭转旧的生活 - 祝你更给力
 Yup. Turn the old life around.

448
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:20,791
 Yeah. Well, hey, more power to you.

449
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:24,495
蒂娜・特纳(美国摇滚教母)做的到的 杰克・韦尔奇(通用电气总裁)也做的到
 If Tina Turner can do it, Jack Walsh can do it, too.

450

My pleasure.

454
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:31,869
 I'm off like a dirty shirt.

455
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:32,603
(chuckles)

456
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,505

00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:40,678
 (humming)

460
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,679
(instrumental rock music plays)

461
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,549
 (door opening, shop bell tinkling)

462
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:47,919

465
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:55,193
 Um, oh, we just got these glasses in.

466
00:19:52,515 --> 00:19:55,602
我们刚进了这些眼镜 真是太…

467
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:56,194
我不喜欢那天那张专辑
 They're really, um...

468
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:59,931

469
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:01,265

- 唱片 - 唱片
The record. Oh, the record.

471
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:05,703
我觉得有点太…
Uh, yeah, I thought it was a little too, uh...

472
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,305
流行了 可能
 Too hip, maybe?

473
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:11,209
是啊 有点太流行了
Yeah, a little too hip.

474
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:11,842
能不能推荐点别的 不那么政治的?
ANDIE: Well, um...

475
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:14,378
BLANE: Think you can recommend something else

476
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,746
a little less political

477
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:18,316
or something?

478
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:19,917
- 林昂内尔・里奇? - 不要
 Lionel Ritchie?

479
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:20,785
 Nah.

480
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:22,386
呃…
 (sucks air through teeth)

481
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,422
- 蒂娜・玛丽? 麦当娜? - 麦当娜 太高深了
 No. Uh, well, hmm...

482
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:26,457

 Madonna?

484
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:28,426
 Yeah, Madonna.

485
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:29,727
是的 很高深 但她有独特的个人风格
That's awfully deep.

486
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:30,461
 Yeah, very deep.

487
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:33,698
 But she's got such great style.

488
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,966
听着
 Yeah. Yeah, listen, um...

489

490
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:37,935
警报响了 稍等一会吧 我马上回来
 Can you hold on for a second?

491
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:40,004
 Sure. Just... I'll, I'll be right back.

492
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:41,872

495
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:46,611
Hold on.

496
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:48,813
这是啥
 What is this?

497
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,314
嗨 今天怎么样
 (alarm continues )

498
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:51,616
 (loudly): Hi!

499
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:52,550
 How's your day?!

500
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:56,020
估计得有300分贝了吧
 Baby pumps out about 300 decibels, huh?

501
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:57,255
- 是你弄的? - 不确定
 (alarm stops)

502
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:57,788
 Did you do this?

503
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,656
Well, I'm not sure.

504
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:00,925
我在用你的洗刷间 我决定不去打扰你
I mean, I was just using your powder room,

505
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,627
and I decided not to disturb you,

506
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:04,895
所以我要从后门走了 但我肯定碰到了 什么东西
so I was going to go out the back door,

507
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:06,731
but I guess I must have touched something.

508
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:08,866
- 你是怎么进来的 - 你生气了?
 How'd you get in here? Are you mad?

509
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:09,734
是 我生气了! 到底都有公共厕所!
 Yes, I'm mad!

510
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:12,036
 There are public bathrooms all over the place!

511
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:13,704
我不是小孩 安迪 这我知道
I'm not nine, Andie. I know that.

512
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:15,873
现在是月末 已经没有座垫圈了
It's just, it's the end of the month.

513
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,842
They're out of toilet seat covers.

514
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:18,542
 (knocking)

515
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:21,812
 DUCKIE: You know what I stickler I am about personal hygiene.

516
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:22,947
 It's very important to me.

517
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,315
 ANDIE: That's ridiculous.

518
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:26,284
 We want you to stop making...

519
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:27,518

522
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:33,057
 Well, what are you shopping for, records or something?

523
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:34,725
- 有收获吗 - 不见得
I guess. You find anything?

524
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:35,860
 No, not really. Not really.

525
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:37,728
我们去打弹子吧 今天肯定成绩好
Well, are we gonna shoot some track, or what?

526
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,464
'Cause, I mean, if we're gonna shoot, we got to shake it, man.

527
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:41,899
我没多少地方可去 我喜欢来这里 请原谅
 I don't have anyplace to go.

528
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:43,601

529
00:21:43,603 --> 00:21:45,936
好吧 我也不好意思跟你发火 我得回去了 回见
It's okay. I'm sorry for getting mad at you.

530
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:48,572
I got to get back out in front, okay?

531
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:49,674

532
00:21:49,676 --> 00:21:51,942
 (shop bell tinkling)

533
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:58,949
这真是个烂警报系统 我开了五次门它才响
 (alarm ringing)

534
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,051
 This is a shitty alarm system.

535
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:03,487
 I opened and closed the door five times before it rang.

536
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:04,755
好了 我这就走 我不会再多待了 不可能!
That's it, I'm leaving.

538
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:07,958
No, no way!

539

 How you doing?

601
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:20,518
我挺好
 Fine.

602
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,620
 And you? Okay.

603
00:25:22,622 --> 00:25:23,254
- 我刚说了我很好了 - 是啊 抱歉
 And you?

604
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:25,656
 Well, I just said I was fine.

605
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:28,058
 Oh, yeah. Sorry.

606
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:32,029
- 这是你第一次出来? - 是的
 So, is this your first time out here?

607
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:32,663
我觉得我在这里也不怎么受欢迎
 Yeah.

608
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:35,165
 I don't think I'm very popular out here

609
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:35,933
不知道 我觉得你挺好啊
either.

610
00:25:35,935 --> 00:25:37,568
 Oh, I don't know.

611
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,136
 You're just fine inside.

612
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:40,704
我也不知道 我对这些其实不大感冒 懂不
 I don't know.

613
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,674
 I'm not really into all their shit, you know.

614
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:46,143
我懂
 Yeah.

615
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:48,946
我懂
 (softly): Yeah.

616
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:53,617
你的电脑把戏不错
 Oh, um, I really liked your computer trick.

617
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:54,852
- 给力吧 - 给力的要命
 Clever, huh?

618
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:58,722
Terribly clever, yeah, terribly.

619
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:03,193
- 要迟到了吗 - 还真是
 Are you late for something?

620
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:05,195
Yeah, I am, as a matter of fact.

621
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:07,264
但也没什么
 But I mean, it's no big deal.

622
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:08,198
 Um...

623
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,303
周五想出去玩吗
 Listen, do you want to... you want to go out Friday?

624
00:26:12,305 --> 00:26:14,705
好的
 Yeah.

625
00:26:14,707 --> 00:26:16,674
- 好吗? - 好啊
 Yeah?

626
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:17,641

628
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:20,110

629
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:21,745
很好 你住在哪儿 我去接你
 Yeah, that's fine. Great. Great.

630
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:25,816
Well, where do you live? I'll pick you up.

631
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:27,651
- 你住在哪儿 - 不好意思
 Where do you live?

632
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:29,119
 Oh, I, I... No, I'm sorry, um,

633
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:30,187
我周五要工作 去商场接我好了
I'm gonna be working on Friday,

634
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:32,856
 so you can just pick me up at the mall.

635
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:34,625
- 好的 - 好
 Okay. Okay?

636
00:26:34,627 --> 00:26:35,693
- 拜拜 - 再见
Bye.

637
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:37,962
 See ya.

638
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,374
布兰 你好吗
Hey, Blane.

639
00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:51,342
伙计 咋了?
How you doing?

640
00:26:51,344 --> 00:26:53,644
 Hey, buddy, what's up?

641
00:26:53,646 --> 00:26:54,812
- 你要干吗 - 没什么 去上课
 What are you up to?

642
00:26:54,814 --> 00:26:56,246
我看到你在外面了
 Oh, not much. Going to class.

643
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:58,682
 I thought I saw you outside.

644
00:26:58,684 --> 00:26:59,717
- 怎么了? - 怎么 你在干什么
 So?

645
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:01,251
So, what are you doing?

646
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:03,387
你是谁 我老妈吗? 好了 我走了 回见
 What are you, my mother?

647
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:04,254
 Come on, I gotta go.

648
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:07,257
- 布兰 到底怎么了 - 没什么
 I'll see you later. Blane, what's going on?

649
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:08,092
可不是没什么 我看到你跟那小妞搭话了 她叫啥 艾迪?
 Nothing.

650
00:27:08,094 --> 00:27:08,859
Well, not nothing,

651
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:10,260
 I mean, I saw you talking to that chick--

652
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:12,630
 what's her name?-- Eddie or something.

653
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:13,330
- 关你什么事 - 我最好的朋友跟个怪胎说话
 So, what do you care?

654
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:16,634
 Listen, my best friend is conversing with a mutant,

655
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:17,635
我很好奇 你没必要这么防我
 you know, I'm curious.

656
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:20,237
I don't think that's any reason to get defensive.

657
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:21,739
我不是防你 我只是碰巧喜欢她 好不?
 I'm not defensive.

658
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:23,173
 I just happen to like her, all right?

659
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:24,408
听着 这是你的生活 跟我无关
 Listen, all right, it's you know,,

660
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:26,043
 it's your life, it's none of my business.

661
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:29,747
 You really don't think she's got something?

662
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:30,219
你就不觉得她很特别?

663
00:27:29,749 --> 00:27:31,915
我真没觉得 对不起了
 No.

664
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:35,352
I really don't, I'm sorry.

665
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:38,322
你要迟到了 伙计
 You're gonna be late, buddy.

666
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:41,125
 (class bell rings)

667
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:48,132
《华沙条约》是由苏维埃共和国
Okay, the Warsaw Pact's a treaty

668
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:49,333
和七个东欧国家签订的
 that was signed by the Soviet Union

669
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:52,036
 and its seven East European satellites, okay.

670
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:54,772
它的作用是…
 And what it did was...

671
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:55,973
建立了一个共同的防御组织 也即…
 it established a mutual

672
00:27:55,975 --> 00:27:56,940
唐老鸭!
defense organization

673
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:58,175
怎么了 怎么了 我写了什么
as a counterweight to NATO.

674
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,309
Duckie! What?

675
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:01,111
 What? What? What?

676
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:03,147
你说"《华沙条约》是以华沙命名的"
 Well, what'd I put?

677
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:03,781
You wrote,

678
00:28:03,783 --> 00:28:06,417
the Warsaw Pact is the pact that's named

679
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:07,751
after Warsaw.

680
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:08,152
老师会知道你在胡说八道的
 Uh-huh.

681
00:28:08,154 --> 00:28:09,720
 So, the teacher's just gonna know

682
00:28:09,722 --> 00:28:10,854
好吧 其他的部分怎么样
 that you're just bullshitting.

683
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:14,191
 Okay, okay, what about the rest of it?

684
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,726
俄国革命也并不发生在德国
Well, the Russian Revolution

685
00:28:15,728 --> 00:28:17,761
did not take place in Germany. Ow.

686
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:19,463
- 那卡尔・马克思是什么人呢? - 他是德国人
Well, what was Karl Marx, then?

687
00:28:19,465 --> 00:28:20,998
- 继续吧 - 但他是德国人
 He was a German.

688
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,932
 Well, there you go.

689
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:24,468
 Yes, but his being German doesn't have anything

690
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,271
跟俄国革命的发生并没有关系!
 to do with where the Russian Revolution occurred.

691
00:28:27,273 --> 00:28:30,474
好吧好吧
 Okay, okay.

692
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,911
好吧 我跟你说点事 你别生气行不?
 Okay, Duckie, can I propose something to you

693
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:35,879
 without your getting upset, or angry?

694
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:38,148
- 看情况了 - 什么情况?
 Well, that depends.

695
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:38,749
不知道 我先这么说 你说吧
On what?

696
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:41,051
 I don't know, I just said that.

697
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,119
你是故意考试不及格 以便一直留在高中
 Go ahead.

698
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:42,886
Well, I propose

699
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,388
that you're deliberately flunking your courses

700
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,490
so that you can stay in high school.

701
00:28:46,492 --> 00:28:47,491
滚吧 我为什么这么做?
 Get out of here!

702
00:28:47,493 --> 00:28:49,193
- 我不知道 你告诉我 - 我并没这么做 所以没什么好说的
 Why, why, why would I do that?

703
00:28:49,195 --> 00:28:50,861
I don't know, you tell me.

704
00:28:50,863 --> 00:28:51,495
 Well, I'm not.

705
00:28:51,497 --> 00:28:52,863
 So, there's nothing to tell.

706
00:28:52,865 --> 00:28:55,999
- 你总是不愿面对现实 - 我在逃避什么?
Well, you know, you're not always one to face things.

707
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:56,834
 What, since when?

708
00:28:56,836 --> 00:28:58,469
未来
 What, what am I not facing?

709
00:28:58,471 --> 00:28:59,136
不管你面不面对现实 它总会发生 知道吗
The future.

710
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:02,206
 Well, whether or not you face the future, it happens,

711
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:02,840
- 你总是贬低自己 为什么 - 我没有贬低自己!
 right?

712
00:29:02,842 --> 00:29:04,942
You run yourself down. Why do you do that?

713
00:29:04,944 --> 00:29:06,143
你觉得我有? 我不觉得我有
 I am not running myself...

714
00:29:06,145 --> 00:29:07,344
 You think I'm running my...

715
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:08,912
为什么 因为我的打扮方式? 让我可以嘲笑自己?
 I don't think I'm running myself down.

716
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,748
 Why b-b-because, because of the way I dress?

717
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,249
这叫做幽默感 你要是有就好了 很美妙的
 'Cause, 'cause I can laugh at myself?

718
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,817
 That's called a sense of humor.

719
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:16,086
 You should get one; they're nice.

720
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,821
- 我们下年要做什么? - 你觉得我还会在上高中
What are we gonna do next year?

721
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:20,758
 Well, according to you, I'll still be in high school.

722
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,358
我是认真的! 过去这八年里的每一天
No, I'm serious.

723
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,392
I mean, not a day has passed,

724
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:24,328
我都至少要跟你说20次话!
in, what, eight years, when I didn't see you

725
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,929
这就叫作奉献
or talk to you at least 20 times.

726
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,965
 Well, that's devotion.

727
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:30,400
我知道 有时就算我生气了 你也知道我悄悄地喜欢这感觉
I know, and even though I sometimes get angry,

728
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:32,136
you know that I secretly love it.

729
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:33,403
我知道的
 You see, I knew that.

730
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:36,807
You know, I hope I'm not the only one in the world

731
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:38,346
我希望不止我一个人觉得你给力

732
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:38,375
that knows what an incredible person you are.

733
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:43,046
到目前为止 似乎你是唯一一个 宝贝
 Well, at this point in time, I'm afraid you are, honey.

734
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:45,082
我去弄点喝的 之后再学习 好不
Okay, I'm gonna get something to drink

735
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:46,450
- 听你的 - 你要什么
and then we work, okay, you promise?

736
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:48,352
 Oh, you bet. Okay, what do you want?

737
00:29:48,354 --> 00:29:52,222
- 啤酒 威士忌 果汁 都行 - 好的
 Oh, beer, scotch, juice box, whatever.

738
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:54,458
Okay.

739
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:58,028
天哪
 (sighs)

740
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,797
 Oh, God.

741
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:02,199
我爱她
 I love this woman.

742
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:06,003
我深爱着她 我要告诉她
 I love this woman and I have to tell her.

743
00:30:06,005 --> 00:30:08,405
如果她笑了 她笑
 And if she laughs, she laughs.

744
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:13,143
如果她不爱我 那就是不爱我
 And if she doesn't love me, she doesn't love me.

745
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:16,914
但要是我不找出来…
But if... if I don't find out...

746
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:20,050
我太爱她了!
 Oh, I love her too much.

747
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:23,320
 (sighs)

748
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:28,992

谢谢
 (makes sound of crowd)

750
00:30:30,396 --> 00:30:31,829
真实就是爱
 Thank you, thank you.

751
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:33,397
 ? Real is love...

752
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:36,099
你是精彩的一员 你知道的
 You're a wonderful crowd here, you know that.

753
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:37,067
爱是生存
 (panting)

754
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:38,502
? Love is living

755
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:40,470
(imitates crowd noise)

756
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:42,005
 (dog whines)

757
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:42,472
你很美 我爱你 你很妙 我爱你的头发
(chuckles)

758
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:43,841
You're fabulous, I do love you,

759
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:45,375
I do love you, you're gorgeous.

760
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:46,376
爱是感觉
I love your hair.

761
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:48,879
? Love is feeling

762
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:52,382
感觉到爱
? Feeling love

763
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:53,584
爱是欲望
 (laughs)

764
00:30:53,586 --> 00:30:57,487
(dog barking) ? Love is wanting

765
00:30:57,489 --> 00:30:59,356
 Ah!

766
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:02,860
她会笑的 我能怪她吗
 She's gonna laugh.

767
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:05,963
 Would I blame her?

768
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:07,331
- 给 - 谢了 但我得闪了
 Here you go. Oh, shit.

769
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:08,966
Honey, thanks, uh, but I'm gonna split,

770
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:10,267
- 怎么了 你的论文怎么办? - 就是去搞论文
 you know. Why? What about your paper?

771
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:12,302
 Uh, that's, that's what I'm gonna do, you see,

772
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:14,605
要是你帮我的话 谢谢了 那就不是我的论文了 而是造假
 'cause, I mean, if you help me, thanks a lot,

773
00:31:14,607 --> 00:31:15,606
 but it'll, it'll,

774
00:31:15,608 --> 00:31:17,174
 it won't be my work, it'll be bogus.

775
00:31:17,176 --> 00:31:20,911
明早见了
 And, you know, and I guess I'll see you in the a.m..

776
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,881
酒后不驾车 所以我骑自行车
 Hey, drinking and driving don't mix.

777
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:26,583
 That's why I ride a bike.

778
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,088
 (sighs)

779
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:38,395
 I got it.

780
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,499
 (screams)

781
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:46,470
JENA: So, uh, what's the deal?

782
00:31:46,472 --> 00:31:48,639
你这周末出去吗?
 You going out this weekend? I don't know.

783
00:31:48,641 --> 00:31:50,073
还不确定呢
I'm not sure yet. Mm?

784
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,241
- 你打算做什么 - 待在家里
 Why? What are you gonna do?

785
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:54,044
- 是吗 又要开始学习了? - 可能吧 熄了好吗
Stay home. Yeah, you going to study again?

786
00:31:54,046 --> 00:31:54,478
Probably.

787
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,213
Would you put that out? (giggling): No.

788
00:31:56,215 --> 00:31:58,448
为啥这么努力学习? 恶心死了 我就不明白
 Well, you study so much, it makes me ill.

789
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,917
不明白? 我不想一辈子都在唱片店工作
 I just don't see the point.

790
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:00,918
You don't? Mm-mmm.

791
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,120
I don't want to work in a record store my whole life.

792
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:05,322
你想当什么 医生?
 Yeah? What do you want to be a doctor?

793
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:07,624
天哪
 (whistle blows) Oh, God.

794
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:08,458
让我们过去 排好队 谢谢
 (sighs)

795
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,027
TEACHER: Okay, let's go, everybody.

796
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:12,963
 Get in your lines, please, thank you!

797
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:15,065
- 沃米斯特! - 到!
 Fulmeister.

798
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:16,366
巴塞特!

799
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:18,702
 Besset!

800
00:32:18,704 --> 00:32:20,637
- 巴萨诺 - 有!
 Basono!

801
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:22,105
- 小心 - 我们身上很臭吗
 Goulong.

802
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:24,641
 Oh, look, watch out.

803
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:25,275
 Ooh.

804
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:26,643
Deeds! Do we smell bad, or something?

805
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:28,545
本尼
 (whispering): Hey, Benny.

806
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:29,346
我希望她们萎缩并掉下来
 Fox.

807
00:32:29,348 --> 00:32:30,147
Penfield.

808
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:32,082
 I hope they shrivel up and fall off.

809
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:34,184
 (whistle blows) Okay.

810
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,053
怎么回事 荷曼小姐?
 What was that, Miss Hoeman?

811
00:32:36,055 --> 00:32:37,521
 Um.

812
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:38,255
我说"我希望她们萎缩并掉下来"
 (clears throat)

813
00:32:38,257 --> 00:32:41,458
 I said, I hope they shrivel up and fall off.

814
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,459
你希望什么萎缩并掉下来?
 (lightly laughs)

815
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,461
 You hope what shrivels up

816
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:45,495
她的胸 迪兹小姐
 and falls off?

817
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:47,564
 Her breasts, Miss Dietz.

818
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:48,398
- 闭嘴! - 对不起
 (laughs)

819
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,600
Shut up! I'm sorry.

820
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,236
你给我出去 荷曼
 You are out of here,

821
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:55,372
好的
Hoeman. Right.

822
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:57,240
拜拜
 Bye-bye.

823
00:32:57,242 --> 00:32:59,576
姑娘们 先走了
Bye, girls.

824
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:02,713
你跟你同伴持一样的态度吗?
 So, uh,

825
00:33:02,715 --> 00:33:05,349
do you share your partner's attitude?

826
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:08,251
不是的
 No, I don't.

827
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:15,759
吃屎去吧
(under breath): Eat shit!

828
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:19,496
不好意思 迪兹小姐
 Excuse me, Miss Dietz.

829
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,298
你只剩几个月了
 You've only got a couple of months left.

830
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,767
你的功课很好
 You're doing extremely well in your courses.

831
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:25,502
我觉得你也很可能获得奖学金
 And I think your chances

832
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,205
 of getting a scholarship are excellent.

833
00:33:28,207 --> 00:33:30,040
- 我知道 唐纳利先生 - 那这是怎么回事
 I know this, Mr. Donnelly.

834
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:31,608
我也不知道 我只是有点厌倦了
 Why are you in here now?

835
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,476
 I don't know.

836
00:33:32,478 --> 00:33:35,178
 I guess I just got a little fed up.

837
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,446
- 厌倦什么 - 我们遭遇的对待
 With what?

838
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:38,749
 The way that we get treated.

839
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:40,484
听着 你在这里接受的是一流的教育
 Look, uh...

840
00:33:40,486 --> 00:33:43,787
 you're getting a top-notch education here,

841
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:47,090
我不想看你就这么前功尽弃
 and I just don't want to see you throw it away.

842
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:50,260
我得到的教育 比我应得的更好
 I'm getting a better education than I deserve.

843
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:51,028
我走运 这个社区的好人允许我来这里上学
 I'm lucky.

844
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,195
I'm fortunate that the good people

845
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,297
of this community allow me to attend this school.

846
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:55,799
- 你又误解我了 - 不 我一切都明白
 Again, you are misunderstanding me.

847
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:58,035
 No, I understand everything, Mr. Donnelly.

848
00:33:58,037 --> 00:34:01,204
我不需要你来解释 我就活在这解释里
 I don't need to have it explained to me.

849
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:01,738
只不过我有时会很生气 会发脾气
 I live it.

850
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,207
 It's just sometimes I get a little upset

851
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,142
 and I lose my temper.

852
00:34:05,144 --> 00:34:08,178
我不想看到我的朋友因为维护自己而受罚
I just don't like to see my friends getting dumped on

853
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:11,648
and punished for defending themselves.

854
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:18,221
这整件事情就当没发生过 好吗
 Well, uh, we'll just forget about this whole thing, okay?

855
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:20,590
好的
 Okay.

856
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,393
詹娜呢?
 What about Jena?

857
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:26,363
- 她也没事 - 谢谢
 She's off, too.

858
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:29,199
 Thank you.

859
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:29,633
安迪
 Andie...

860
00:34:29,635 --> 00:34:34,071
如果你一幅不易接近的样子
 if you put out signals that you don't want to belong,

861
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:37,107
人们是不会接近你的
 people are going to make sure that you don't.

862
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,343
这理论真妙
 That's a beautiful theory.

863
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,379
安迪! 安迪!
 Andie, Andie, Andie, listen.

864
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:45,449
我听说了发生的事 尽快从家政课上赶来了
I heard what happened and, and I came as fast as I could.

865
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:47,250
- 严重吗? - 没什么
I cut out of home ec and everything.

866
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:48,118
- 你生气了吗 - 没有
Was, was it really bad?

867
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,286
 No, it was nothing. Are you upset?

868
00:34:49,288 --> 00:34:50,687
我看的出来你生气了 你眼睛都斜了
No, I'm not. No-- yes, yes, you are.

869
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:52,522
 I can tell; your eyes get all squinty and everything.

870
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:55,625
- 我知道怎么能让你感觉好一点 - 我觉得很好!
 Listen, I know just what to do to make you feel better.

871
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:56,359
我这周末带你去玩 你钓鱼吗
 I feel fine.

872
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:58,695
 I want to take you away this weekend.

873
00:34:58,697 --> 00:34:59,429
 Do you fish?

874
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:00,430
- 好了 现在就走了 - 我要上课!
(Andie sighs, class bell rings)

875
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,265
 Okay, then we can go right now.

876
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:02,766
- 今晚吧 我不接受拒绝 - 请试一下
 I have class.

877
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:05,735
Tonight at 7:00 and I won't take no for an answer.

878
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:07,504
这个女人的内心在受折磨 这就是全部的意义
 Try, please.

879
00:35:07,506 --> 00:35:09,239
 This woman is suffering inside.

880
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:11,708
 That's all there is to it.

881
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,442
伙计 下次我会踢你屁股 这次就这么算了
 (banging loudly)

882
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:14,611
 Yo, man, next time I'll kick your ass.

883
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:15,378
我是开玩笑而已
Dat'll be dat.

884
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:19,182
Dat'll-- I'm just kidding; that's-- it's a joke.

885
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:21,118
股市怎么样了
How about that stock market?

886
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,287
我的代理人是EF・休顿 他说…
My broker is E.F. Hutton, and E.F. Hutton says...

887
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,489
你看吧 没用的 我就说肯定没用
You see, it never works.

888
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:26,223
 It never works.

889
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:28,558
 I've never seen that work...

890
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,360
妈的!
 (girls scream) DUCKIE: Oh, shit!

891
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:32,462
 GIRL: What's going on out there?

892
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,831
 Aah...

893
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:38,735
原来里面是这样的
 So this is what it looks like.

894
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:39,503
真不错 稍等一下
 This is great.

895
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:40,871
 Hey, wait a minute, wai-w-w-w-wait.

896
00:35:40,873 --> 00:35:43,874
你们的隔间是有门的 不会卡住
 You got doors on the stalls, they're not stopped.

897
00:35:43,876 --> 00:35:44,674
等等 男厕所就没有这些东西!
 Wait a minute.

898
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:46,476
 We don't have none of this stuff in the boys'--

899
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:47,911
 wait a minute, we don't got none of this.

900
00:35:47,913 --> 00:35:49,779
我们的隔间没有门…
 We don't got doors on the stalls in the boys' room.

901
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:51,248
这是什么 我们也没有糖果机
 We don't have-- what is this, what?

902
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,849
 We don't have a candy machine in the boys' room.

903
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:54,851
- 什么都没有 - 是谁在叫
 We don't got none of that. GIRL: I'm gonna start screaming

904
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:56,486
 in a minute if you don't get out of here.

905
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:57,921
对不起 我现在要见校长了
 I'm sorry, no, I want the principal here.

906
00:35:57,923 --> 00:35:59,356
 I want him here this instant.

907
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:01,658
就这样 我可以等 再见
 I want-- now, this instant.

908
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,726
 I'll wait.

909
00:36:02,728 --> 00:36:04,427
 Thank you.

910
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:15,839
妈的 为什么我做不来
 Oh, shit!

911
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:18,808
Why can't I do this?

912
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:21,178
你做什么了 这… 你要先归零
 What have you done?

913
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,946
 This-- you have to subtotal first.

914
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:24,614
我每次都说 你每次都不听
 I tell you this every time.

915
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:25,549
 You never listen.

916
00:36:25,551 --> 00:36:31,588
再来一曲 然后就去享受一段糟糕的恋爱
One more tune, then it's off to enjoy a terrible relationship.

917
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,722
邻家男孩就喜欢这个
 (drops needle on record)

918
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:34,724
 The furrier next door loves this.

919
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:36,259
 ? Soft words

920
00:36:36,261 --> 00:36:40,797
 ? They are spoke so gentle, yeah ?

921
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,633
 (loud knocking)

922
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:47,404
 ? It makes it easier

923
00:36:47,406 --> 00:36:49,906
 ? Easier to bear

924
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:51,474
(shop bell rings)

925
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:52,442
 (snaps fingers)

926
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:55,912
? You won't regret it, no, no ?

927
00:36:56,247 --> 00:37:00,951
(mouthing words) ? Them young girls, they don't forget it ?

928
00:37:00,953 --> 00:37:01,818
 ? Love

929
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:06,923
 ? Is their whole happiness

930
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:09,726
 ? Yeah

931
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:14,798
 ? But it's all so easy ?

932
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,800
 ? All you got to do is

933
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:19,736
 ? Try, try a little...

934
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:21,638
 ? Tenderness

935
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:26,376
 ? Yeah, oh, you got to do it, man ?

936
00:37:26,378 --> 00:37:28,411
? Hold her where you want her

937
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:31,648
? Squeeze her, don't tease her ?

938
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,250
 ? Never leave her

939
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:34,551
 ? Give to her

940
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:38,555
 ? Got, got to try a little tenderness ?

941
00:37:38,557 --> 00:37:39,623
 ? Yeah, yeah, yeah

942
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:43,960
 ? You got to know how to love her, man ?

943
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:49,332
 ? You've got to squeeze her, don't tease her ?

944
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:50,000
 ? Never leave

945
00:37:50,002 --> 00:37:52,335
 ? You've got to hold her ?

946
00:37:52,337 --> 00:37:53,570
 ? Rub her softly

947
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:57,941
 ? Try a little tenderness, yeah, yeah, yeah ?

948
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:00,310
 ? You got to rub her gently

949
00:38:00,312 --> 00:38:02,579
 ? Don't bruise her, no, no ?

950
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:03,780
 ? You got to love her

951
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:06,850
 ? Tease her, don't displease her ?

952
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:09,352
 ? Got to try, now, now, now

953
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:09,953
 ? Try...

954
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:11,988
 ? Try a little tenderness

955
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,357
 ? Yeah...

956
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:17,527
 ? You got to know what to do, man ?

957
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:18,561
 ? Take this advice

958
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:24,334
 ? You got to love, squeeze, don't tease my baby ?

959
00:38:24,336 --> 00:38:25,769
 ? Love her long...

960
00:38:25,771 --> 00:38:26,836
 (music fades out)

961
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:28,471
 (breathing heavily)

962
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:30,340
女士们 这曲子很不错
 (with accent): Evening, young ladies.

963
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:31,474
我妈妈以前会唱这歌 我爱奥蒂丝
 This is a very good tune.

964
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:32,776
 My mother used to sing this.

965
00:38:32,778 --> 00:38:34,577
我们关门了
 This is Otis; I love Otis.

966
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:35,345
- 知道年长的女人会怎么对我吗? - 给你换尿布?
We're closed.

967
00:38:35,347 --> 00:38:37,714
 You know what an older woman does for me?

968
00:38:37,716 --> 00:38:38,548
爱抚? 你勉强算备选吧
Changes your diapers?

969
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,649
 (without accent:) Touche.

970
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,451
但这是唐老鸭的爱情生活
 No, seriously though, you're a very smoky alternative,

971
00:38:41,453 --> 00:38:44,554
 but this is the Duck Man's love in life.

972
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:45,088
- 可以吗 - 这样的?
 Shall we?

973
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,090
You ever had one of these?

974
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:50,527
不要吧
 I don't think so.

975
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:54,497
好了 我们锄大地吧!
 Come on... let's plow.

976
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:02,405
我冒犯她们了
 (with accent): Do I offend?

977
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:06,876
安迪
 Andie, hon.

978
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:09,879
已经七点多了 不用浪费唇膏了
Listen, it's after 7:00.

979
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:11,514
- 我知道 罗娜 - 我不想泼你冷水
Don't waste good lip gloss.

980
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:12,015
I know, Iona.

981
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:14,751
 I mean, I don't mean to be a bitch or anything,

982
00:39:14,753 --> 00:39:15,685
但我觉得你今晚没有艳遇的
 but I don't think

983
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:19,356
 Mr. Wonderful is going to happen tonight.

984
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:24,561
我也不知道我在做什么
I don't know what I'm doing.

985
00:39:24,563 --> 00:39:27,130
心怀妄想在化妆
 Wishful makeupping.

986
00:39:27,132 --> 00:39:28,665
等等 你们在用一种秘密的肢体语言交流
 Come on.

987
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:29,399
 Wait, wait.

988
00:39:29,401 --> 00:39:31,534
 You babes are, like, talking a sign language

989
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,870
而这里的唐老鸭完全不能理解
 that the old Ducker here just does not understand.

990
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:35,939
介不介意指教一下 我都糊涂了
 Now, would you mind filling me in here?

991
00:39:35,941 --> 00:39:37,640
她被放鸽子了 傻子
 I'm a little confused.

992
00:39:37,642 --> 00:39:40,577
 She got stood up, twerp.

993
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:41,111
放鸽子? 怎么回事 我在这儿呢!
 Stood up?

994
00:39:41,113 --> 00:39:42,412
Wait, h-how so? Wait, I'm here.

995
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:45,115
这是女性神秘协议还是什么?
 I mean, is this like one of those feminine mystique deals

996
00:39:45,117 --> 00:39:46,750
 or something?

997
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,490
他来了
 He showed.

998
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:57,761
 Um...

999
00:39:57,763 --> 00:40:00,897
安迪
 Andie.

1000
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,905
我来
 I'll get that.

1001
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,977
- 唐老鸭 真的对不起 - 这真的…
Duckie, I'm really sorry.

1002
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:15,578
 What, is this, um, you're gonna,

1003
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,913
你要跟他出去? 这是什么 约会?
 you're gonna go out with this guy?

1004
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:20,417
 I mean, is this, you know, like, a date, or something?

1005
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:20,784
是的 你会喜欢他的
Yeah.

1006
00:40:20,786 --> 00:40:22,051
他真的跟别人不一样
I mean, you'll like him.

1007
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:25,588
He's not like the other guys, seriously.

1008
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,057
不 不可能 安迪!
 No, n-no way, Andie!

1009
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:29,726
你真气死我了 因为他们在侮辱每个人 包括你
 You really piss me off, you know, 'cause,

1010
00:40:29,728 --> 00:40:32,195
 'cause you know they shit all over everybody, including you.

1011
00:40:32,197 --> 00:40:34,831
- 我真不相信你会这么蠢 - 我不会让别人侮辱我的
 I just-- I can't believe you'd be this stupid.

1012
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:35,799
 Who's shitting on me?

1013
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:37,133
 I'm not gonna let anybody shit on me.

1014
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:40,437
他会把你玩过就甩掉 天哪 我可以为你去死!
 He's just-- he's gonna use your ass and throw you away.

1015
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:41,938
那我应该怎么办 他请我出去 而我喜欢他
God, I would have died for you.

1016
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,440
 So what am I supposed to do?

1017
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:44,441
要是我知道他有钱就讨厌他
He asked me out and I like him.

1018
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:45,675
If I hate him because he's got mon--

1019
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:47,610
 just listen to me-- if I hate him because he's got money,

1020
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,980
跟他们讨厌我们没钱是一样的 明白吗
 that's the exact same thing as them hating us because we don't.

1021
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:51,748
你这么做就是不尊重自己
Do you understand?

1022
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:54,717
 You can't do this and, and respect yourself.

1023
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:55,652
- 不能的 - 我来做决定 好吗
 Y-You, you... you can't.

1024
00:40:55,654 --> 00:40:57,654
 Well, I'll make that decision, all right?

1025
00:40:57,656 --> 00:40:59,823
当然 你想做什么都能做!
 Sure, you c-- you can do what you want.

1026
00:40:59,825 --> 00:41:01,024
你这么说是因为我要跟布兰出去
You know, you're talking like that

1027
00:41:01,026 --> 00:41:03,226
just because I'm going out with Blane.

1028
00:41:03,228 --> 00:41:03,993
布兰? 他叫布兰?
 Blane?

1029
00:41:03,995 --> 00:41:04,894
 His, his name is Blane?

1030
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:08,164
那是家电品牌 那不是名字!
Oh... that's a major appliance, that's not a name.

1031
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:10,733
我跟布兰出去不代表我不能当你的朋友
 Just because I'm going out with Blane doesn't mean

1032
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:11,835
 I can't be friends with you.

1033
00:41:11,837 --> 00:41:14,737
- 这不会改变我对你的感觉 - 你真贴心
I mean, it doesn't change the way I feel about you.

1034
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:15,772
很高兴 重点是这个 安迪
 Oh, that's very nice.

1035
00:41:15,774 --> 00:41:16,706
 I'm, I'm glad.

1036
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:18,174
 Here's... here's the point, Andie.

1037
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:19,943
我并不特别关心你喜不喜欢我
 I'm n-- I'm not particularly concerned

1038
00:41:19,945 --> 00:41:22,145
with whether or not you like me.

1039
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,581
因为我生来就喜欢你 我却不能再喜欢你了
 'Cause I live to like you and, and,

1040
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:26,983
 and I can't like you anymore.

1041
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,552
所以当你说你的心都碎了 你觉得卑下 肮脏
 So, so when you get your heart splattered all over hell

1042
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:31,120
 and, and you're feeling really low and dirty,

1043
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:33,189
别指望我能让你好起来 因为…
 don't, don't look to me to help pump you back up,

1044
00:41:33,191 --> 00:41:36,493
 'cause, 'cause, 'cause, 'cause maybe for the first time

1045
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:38,595
因为也许在你生命中的第一次 我将不在场
in your life, I won't be there.

1046
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:41,498
我不敢相信你说出这种话来
 I can't believe you're actually saying this.

1047
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:46,035
我猜这话就是不好听
 Well, I guess that's just tough shit.

1048
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,179
- 抱歉 - 抱歉
Sorry. Sorry.

1049
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,186
 (loud thud)

1050
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,625
- 店里那家伙… - 他是我朋友
 That guy in the store.

1051
00:42:08,627 --> 00:42:09,859
我从小就认识他了 他是个好人
Oh, he was a friend of mine.

1052
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:12,228
I've known him since I was a kid.

1053
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,197
- 是吗 - 是的 我很喜欢他
He's a really nice guy. Yeah?

1054
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,533
Yeah, I like him a lot.

1055
00:42:16,535 --> 00:42:19,769
想回家换衣服吗
 So you want to go home and change?

1056
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:21,170
已经换了
(laughs quietly)

1057
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:22,572
I already did.

1058
00:42:22,574 --> 00:42:23,106
- 抱歉 - 没关系
 (laughs quietly)

1059
00:42:23,108 --> 00:42:25,642
 Sorry. No, that's okay.

1060
00:42:25,644 --> 00:42:27,176
 Oh, boy.

1061
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:32,248
我们要去哪儿
So, where are we going?

1062
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,984
你要去派对?
 You up for a party?

1063
00:42:34,986 --> 00:42:37,053
是的 不 也许?
 Yeah? No? Maybe?

1064
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:41,090
我不想去
No, I don't think so.

1065
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:42,125
- 为什么 - 为什么
 Why? "Why?"

1066
00:42:42,127 --> 00:42:43,793
- 他们是我朋友 没关系 - 是你的朋友
 Come on, they're my friends, it's okay.

1067
00:42:43,795 --> 00:42:45,194
直到我认为他们接受了你 否则我不会走的
That's it; they're <i>your</i> friends.

1068
00:42:45,196 --> 00:42:46,129
 I wouldn't take you

1069
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:48,064
 if I didn't think they'd accept you.

1070
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:50,233
我们不能去别的地方吗
Can't we just go somewhere else?

1071
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:51,868
安迪 我喜欢你 我觉得你也喜欢我
 Hey, Andie, I like you.

1072
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:52,702
我知道有闲言碎语 但如果你不介意我也一样
 I think you like me.

1073
00:42:52,704 --> 00:42:54,871
 I mean, we both know there's a lot of bullshit that goes on,

1074
00:42:54,873 --> 00:42:56,306
 but if you're above it, I'm above it.

1075
00:42:56,308 --> 00:42:58,908
如果我们想有所发展 我们就要应对 是不是
 If we want to make anything out of this whatever,

1076
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,144
 we got to deal with it, right?

1077
00:43:01,146 --> 00:43:01,778
- 是的 - 好了 我跟你一样可能有所损失
 Yeah.

1078
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,746
 Come on, I got as much to lose as you.

1079
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:05,915
如果你想 我们可以跟你的朋友出去 我们可以不问世事
 We can go out with your friends if you want.

1080
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:08,351
 Go crawl under a rock.

1081
00:43:08,353 --> 00:43:10,219
只要你想 你来做决定
 Anything you want.

1082
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:11,054
- 我们可以去滑翔 - 我没有滑翔过
The choice is yours.

1083
00:43:11,056 --> 00:43:13,156
We can go hang gliding. You like hang gliding?

1084
00:43:13,158 --> 00:43:14,724
凡事都有第一次
 I've never been hang gliding.

1085
00:43:14,726 --> 00:43:17,961
 Well, first for everything.

1086
00:43:17,963 --> 00:43:20,663
要是不好玩 我们就走
 If it's a bad time, we leave.

1087
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:24,701
 (thunder rumbling)

1088
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:53,062
 ?

1089
00:43:53,064 --> 00:43:56,733
 MAN (faintly): It's time for more beer!

1090
00:43:57,901 --> 00:43:59,836
- 嗨 布兰 - 艾迪
 Hi, Blane. Hey, Eddie.

1091
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:00,737
 Hey, see you later.

1092
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:04,207
 (music playing, partyers laughing and chatting)

1093
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:10,713
Hey, what's up, bro?

1094
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:16,953
你是不是艺术课上那女孩?
Hey, aren't you the girl in my art class?

1095
00:44:16,955 --> 00:44:18,121
珍珠很漂亮 这不是晚宴 宝贝
 Nice pearls.

1096
00:44:18,123 --> 00:44:21,157
This isn't a dinner party, honey.

1097
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:21,891
小心
 Watch it.

1098
00:44:21,893 --> 00:44:23,726
- 嘿 布兰 你好吗 - 嘿 凯文
Hey, Blane, how you doing?

1099
00:44:23,728 --> 00:44:25,995
 Hey, Kev, what's up?

1100
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:31,934
 ? So I keep believing

1101
00:44:31,936 --> 00:44:37,173
 ? That you and I can change the world ?

1102
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:41,144
 ? I'm going 'round and 'round, 'round again ?

1103
00:44:41,146 --> 00:44:44,881
 ? I say things that I really shouldn't say ?

1104
00:44:44,883 --> 00:44:49,886
 ? I'm going 'round, 'round again ?

1105
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:57,360
真不敢相信我跟他们是朋友
 I can't believe I actually associate with these people.

1106
00:44:57,362 --> 00:45:01,097
我不敢相信我真来了
 I can't believe that I'm actually here.

1107
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:02,298
- 够糟的是吧? - 是够糟的
 Pretty bad, huh?

1108
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,401
 Yeah, it's pretty bad.

1109
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:07,770
不好意思
 I'm sorry.

1110
00:45:07,772 --> 00:45:09,172
我们上楼吧
 Hey, let's go upstairs,

1111
00:45:09,174 --> 00:45:11,774
huh?

1112
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:15,845
好了
 Look, I didn't come here to get you off, okay?

1113
00:45:13,356 --> 00:45:16,776
我不是为了赚你便宜 我没有这个心

1114
00:45:15,847 --> 00:45:17,013
 That was not my idea.

1115
00:45:17,015 --> 00:45:17,447
我不是这个意思 我还没亲你呢 是不是
 Andie.

1116
00:45:17,449 --> 00:45:18,948
 Come on, that is not what I meant.

1117
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:21,751
 I haven't even tried to kiss you, have I?

1118
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,887
这边安静一点 好不
Look, it's quieter up there, okay?

1119
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:25,388
来吧 我的手会放在口袋里 我保证
 Come on.

1120
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:29,726
These hands will remain in these pockets, I swear to God.

1121
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:40,269
这样好了吧 我毫无防御能力
 Look at me here.

1122
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:41,037
 Come on.

1123
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:42,271
而且傻的冒泡
 I'm utterly defenseless.

1124
00:45:42,273 --> 00:45:44,173
And utterly foolish.

1125
00:45:44,175 --> 00:45:46,776
Come on.

1126
00:45:46,778 --> 00:45:50,379
- 你觉得这地毯怎么样 - 很漂亮
So what do you think of these carpets, huh?

1127
00:45:50,381 --> 00:45:52,982
 Utterly fab.

1128
00:45:58,122 --> 00:46:00,389
肯定好玩的
 It's going to be good.

1129
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:02,091
- 嘿 布兰 - 什泰夫
 Oh, hey, Blane.

1130
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:03,793
- 你好吗 - 很好
 Steff. How're you doing?

1131
00:46:03,795 --> 00:46:05,461
- 我再找间房 - 不用 进来吧
 All right... no, I'll get another room.

1132
00:46:05,463 --> 00:46:09,065
 No, no, no, no, come on in. I'm watching some tunes here.

1133
00:46:07,326 --> 00:46:09,661
我正看卡通呢

1134
00:46:09,067 --> 00:46:11,934
 So... who you got with you here, Blane?

1135
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:17,273
你跟谁一起来的 布兰?
 Uh, Andie, this is Steff; Steff, Andie.

1136
00:46:13,332 --> 00:46:16,001
安迪 这是什泰夫 什泰夫 这是安迪

1137
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:20,309
很高兴见到你 安迪
 Oh, it's very nice to meet you, Andie.

1138
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:23,813
你是想过来坐下还是上床?
 Ah, listen, uh, you want to come in and s-sit down?

1139
00:46:23,815 --> 00:46:25,982
不用 我们不用
Or you want the bed, is that it? No, no.

1140
00:46:25,984 --> 00:46:28,417
过来喝一杯 想来点什么
 We're fine. At least come in and have a drink.

1141
00:46:28,419 --> 00:46:29,852
这是我高中生涯里最后一场重大的派对
 Let's go. Can I get you something?

1142
00:46:29,854 --> 00:46:33,456
I mean, this is my last serious party of my high school career.

1143
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:38,194
希望你们能挺到周日 那时我家就没人了
I hope you guys are gonna tough it out until Sunday,

1144
00:46:38,196 --> 00:46:39,495
我觉得这个会杀了那个狗娘养的 布兰
at least when my folks get home.

1145
00:46:39,497 --> 00:46:42,865
I think this one may just finally kill the old

1146
00:46:42,867 --> 00:46:44,133
离童贞又远了一大步
 son of a bitch, Blane.

1147
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:46,903
Another giant step away

1148
00:46:46,905 --> 00:46:47,870
你是个婊子 是不是 本尼?
from virginity I went.

1149
00:46:47,872 --> 00:46:51,307
 You are a slut, aren't you, Benny?

1150
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:03,052
天哪
 (sighs): Oh, my God.

1151
00:47:03,054 --> 00:47:06,589
- 我做恶梦了? - 我们有客人了
 Am I having a nightmare? We've got guests.

1152
00:47:06,591 --> 00:47:09,225
我认识你 你跟我一起上数学课
 BENNY: I know you.

1153
00:47:09,227 --> 00:47:11,194
 You're in my calculus class.

1154
00:47:11,196 --> 00:47:12,528
- 体育课 - 你叫体育课?
 Gym.

1155
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:14,096
你真没用 是不是
 Your name's Jim?

1156
00:47:14,098 --> 00:47:16,332
 You are worthless, aren't you?

1157
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:20,303
你和你朋友那天对我可不怎么友好
 You and your friends gave me a lot of shit the other day. Everybody gives you shit.

1158
00:47:20,305 --> 00:47:21,504
- 放轻松 本尼, - 这是什泰夫的派对 布兰
Take it easy, Benny, huh?

1159
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:24,040
 This is Steff's party, Blane.

1160
00:47:24,042 --> 00:47:25,608
- 不用告诉我该做什么 - 什泰夫…
 Don't tell me what to do.

1161
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:26,309
你不能随便带什么人来
 Steff.

1162
00:47:26,311 --> 00:47:29,846
I mean, you shouldn't be allowed to invite just anybody.

1163
00:47:29,848 --> 00:47:34,483
什泰夫 她搞坏了气氛
 Steff, she's going to ruin my night.

1164
00:47:34,485 --> 00:47:35,418
- 闭嘴 本尼 - 你是基 布兰
Shut up, Benny!

1165
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,919
 You're a faggot, Blane.

1166
00:47:36,921 --> 00:47:39,856
好吧 听着 本尼
 All right, okay, listen, Benny...

1167
00:47:40,084 --> 00:47:42,837
- 我们还是… - 你要去哪儿

1168
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:43,192
- 我们把房间让给他们 - 为什么
 Why don't we just... Where are you going?

1169
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,394
 Let's just leave them with the room, okay? Why?

1170
00:47:45,396 --> 00:47:48,364
- …我们去找点吃的 - 你知道我喜欢什么
 And we will get you something to eat, all right.

1171
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:49,999
肋骨吧
Oh, you've got what I want.

1172
00:47:50,001 --> 00:47:51,367
 Some ribs, or something.

1173
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:55,438
你们先玩吧 等会儿见
 Listen, you guys, enjoy yourselves, and, uh...

1174
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,506
 we'll see you later, maybe.

1175
00:47:57,508 --> 00:47:58,507
我怀疑
 BENNY: I doubt it.

1176
00:47:58,509 --> 00:47:59,508
- 还好吗 - 没事
 STEFF: You all right?

1177
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:02,511
你是个混蛋 我以前还不知道呢
 Fine. You're an asshole. All right.

1178
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,247
我带她去别处发疯 自己玩吧 布兰
 I don't want to know what you are.

1179
00:48:04,249 --> 00:48:08,251
 I'm gonna take her to throw up somewhere. Listen, enjoy yourself.

1180
00:48:10,187 --> 00:48:13,389
他们一喝酒就这样 坏主意
They're kind of jerks when they drink, huh?

1181
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:14,423
现在能带我走了吗
 Bad idea.

1182
00:48:14,425 --> 00:48:17,360
 Can you just get me out of here now?

1183
00:48:17,362 --> 00:48:19,595
好的
 Yeah.

1184
00:48:19,597 --> 00:48:21,664
我不想送你回家 我想跟你在一起
 Look, I don't want to take you home.

1185
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:23,199
如果这里不好就换别处 只要你想
I mean, I'd like to be with you.

1186
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:26,535
If not here, somewhere else; anywhere you want.

1187
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:28,638
对不起 我能说什么呢 我犯了个错
 I'm sorry.

1188
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,573
 What can I say? I made a mistake.

1189
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:32,408
我高估了我的朋友 抱歉
 I overestimated my friends.

1190
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,911
I'm sorry.

1191
00:48:34,913 --> 00:48:38,481
- 你想打我吗 - 是的
 What, you want to hit me?

1192
00:48:38,483 --> 00:48:40,516

1193
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:43,519
请吧
 Be my guest.

1194
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:49,125
 (indistinct chatter, laughter)

1195
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:55,298
 (The Rave-Ups "Rave-up/Shut-up" begins)

1196
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,100
 ? Grow up

1197
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:01,637
 ? My good beliefs say to me, stand up ?

1198
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:05,474
 ? Like a real man is supposed to be, rave up ?

1199
00:49:05,476 --> 00:49:09,578
 ? Rest of all your fantasies, rave up ?

1200
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:11,681
想知道我的事?
 ? It's just a dream... ?

1201
00:49:11,683 --> 00:49:14,283
You want to know my thing?

1202
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:16,319
要是我真心喜欢一个女孩
If I really have it solid for a girl,

1203
00:49:16,321 --> 00:49:20,723
我会骑车到她家
I'll ride by her house on my bike.

1204
00:49:20,725 --> 00:49:25,061
我会一天去一百次
I'll do it like... like a hundred times in a day.

1205
00:49:25,063 --> 00:49:27,163
这真是… 太强了
It's really-- it's intense.

1206
00:49:27,165 --> 00:49:29,031
你停车吗
 You ever park?

1207
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:34,070
我是那种开车驶过的人
I'm kind of a drive-by kind of guy.

1208
00:49:34,072 --> 00:49:34,704
 ? Rave up

1209
00:49:34,706 --> 00:49:38,641
 ? 'Cause being down ain't being a rat's head up ?

1210
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:44,080
 ? So fool those rats another time, rave up... ?

1211
00:49:44,082 --> 00:49:46,482
要喝一杯吗
You want a drink? Yeah.

1212
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:47,717

1216
00:49:57,227 --> 00:49:59,528
好吧 你得帮我一把
Okay, you're gonna have to help me out here.

1217
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:05,334
有一天那女孩会知道她错过了什么
You know, you know, someday that girl's going to realize just what she missed.

1218
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:09,572
别停下 再来!
Come on, don't stop, give me more!

1219
00:50:09,574 --> 00:50:11,207

- 白马痞子出去了? - 不 他在吧台
 Prince Charming whimp out?

1222
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:20,249
 No, no, he's at the bar.

1223
00:50:20,251 --> 00:50:22,318
唐老鸭
 Duckie?

1224
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,619
他不高兴
 (yawns)

1225
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:24,487
他不想再骑车经过你家了
 He's sulking.

1226
00:50:24,489 --> 00:50:28,457
 He's not gonna ride his bike past your house anymore.

1227
00:50:28,459 --> 00:50:31,761
唐老鸭 你真是个大混蛋
 Duckie, you're being

1228
00:50:31,763 --> 00:50:33,796
 a real jerk.

1229
00:50:33,798 --> 00:50:38,100
他是怎么进来的
 How'd he get in here anyway?

1230
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,170
- 我说他是我孩子 - 你怎么会来
 I said he was my kid.

1231
00:50:41,172 --> 00:50:43,039
 How come you're here?

1232
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:47,309
我整晚都在研究这问题呢
 I've been trying to figure that all night.

1233
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:52,381

1234
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:55,051
- 抱歉 - 妈妈给你做的?
Sorry. Mom make this for you?

1236
00:50:56,587 --> 00:50:59,155
不好意思
 ? You lost a lot when you lost me ?

1237
00:50:59,157 --> 00:51:04,427

1238
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:09,365
 ? You lost a lot when you lost me, six paperback books... ?

 DUCKIE: Oh, wait, wait, <i>you</i> had an intense party?

1251
00:51:36,561 --> 00:51:40,096
- 不 是我一个朋友开的 - 唐老鸭 闭嘴
 No, it was a friend of mine's, I said.

1252
00:51:40,098 --> 00:51:42,598
 Duckie... shut up!

1253
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,301
- 有什么问题 - 这是一首古典作品
 What's the problem?

1254
00:51:45,303 --> 00:51:47,403
This is a classic, classic piece of work here.

1255
00:51:47,405 --> 00:51:48,537
- 唐老鸭 好了! - 菲尔

BLANE: Hey, Phil, I think you're making Andie uncomfortable.

1257
00:51:50,808 --> 00:51:52,741
Why don't you just knock it off? What's the problem?

1258
00:51:52,743 --> 00:51:55,511
我把一生都奉献给了她 他却冲上来自认为了解她
 I devoted my life to the girl, and this guy, he comes

1259
00:51:55,513 --> 00:51:57,746
in one day and-and-and thinks he knows her, that's funny.

1260
00:51:57,748 --> 00:51:59,815
你可以打电话给大卫・莱特曼 他一分钟就可以给你订上
You should give David Letterman a ring sometime.

1261
00:51:59,817 --> 00:52:02,118
菲尔 你想让我们走吗
I'm sure he'd book you in a minute.

1262
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,486
是的 非常感谢
 Phil, would you like us to leave?

1263
00:52:03,488 --> 00:52:05,754
 You know, that's very perceptive.

1264
00:52:05,756 --> 00:52:07,323
好
 Come on.

1265
00:52:07,325 --> 00:52:10,759

 (laughing): And look at the manners on this guy; this was a treat.

1266
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:13,195
你只是个小孩子
Really, thanks a million. You're a great couple of kids, really.

1267
00:52:13,197 --> 00:52:16,899
今晚我竟然还为你难过 你个蠢蛋侏儒!
 You know, I can't believe I actually felt bad for you tonight,

1268
00:52:16,901 --> 00:52:18,801
 retarded, little dwarf.

1269

 Sorry. No problem.

1273
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:27,143
 (mockingly): No problem.

1274
00:52:27,145 --> 00:52:27,910
说吧 大傻逼 从你嘴里说出来我觉得是恭维呢
You're an asshole.

1275
00:52:27,912 --> 00:52:28,811
 Hey, blow me, butt wad.

1276
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:31,213
 Coming from you, I take it as a compliment.

1277
00:52:31,215 --> 00:52:33,883
安迪!

我要早起 今晚就算了吧
 I gotta get up early.

1283
00:53:07,718 --> 00:53:10,653
 Why don't we just forget it.

1284
00:53:10,655 --> 00:53:13,189
干吗 回家?

 You know, I can, I can... Trax?

1293
00:53:30,341 --> 00:53:31,574

 I don't want you to take me home.

1306
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,260

1307
00:53:51,262 --> 00:53:52,895

1328
00:54:58,729 --> 00:55:00,796
不知道 这对我来说太怪了 也许这样是不对的
I don't know, it's just...

1329
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:04,466
It's too weird for me, you know? Maybe this shouldn't happen.

1330
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:06,535
哪样 你和我?
 What, you and me?

1331
00:55:06,537 --> 00:55:09,004
也许不会一直这样 但并不意味着这样就是错的
 Well, you know, maybe it doesn't happen all the time,

1332
00:55:09,006 --> 00:55:12,074
 it doesn't mean it isn't right. Right?

1333
00:55:12,076 --> 00:55:15,544
并不意味着我们不能试试
 Doesn't mean you can't try.

1334
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:22,551
我请你去毕业舞会能不能感觉好一点
 Would you feel any better if I asked you to the prom?

1335
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,521
我知道毕业舞会挺傻的 所以要是你不想去也没什么…
 I mean, I know the prom's kind of lame,

1336
00:55:25,523 --> 00:55:28,957
 so if you don't want to go, it's really no big deal.

1337
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,622
 (door squeaking)

1338
00:56:01,491 --> 00:56:02,891
嘿 怎么了
 (screams)

1339
00:56:02,893 --> 00:56:04,860
 Hey. What?

1340
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:06,929
成了 他邀请我了
 It happened!

1341
00:56:06,931 --> 00:56:08,597
- 还有呢? - 我接受了
 He asked me.

1342
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:09,865
 And?

1343
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:11,767
祝贺你
 I accepted!

1344
00:56:11,769 --> 00:56:13,035
不用再蹦着跳着等电话了
 Well, congratulations.

1345
00:56:13,037 --> 00:56:14,136
 No more moping around

1346
00:56:14,138 --> 00:56:17,740
the house waiting for the telephone to ring?

1347
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:21,510
怎么 你恋爱了?
 So... you in love?

1348
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,114
- 我觉得是吧 - 对方是谁
 Yeah, I think I am.

1349
00:56:25,116 --> 00:56:27,049
 Well, who is this guy?

1350
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:28,550
他叫布兰 是毕业班的 他好帅
 His name is Blane.

1351
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:31,587
 And he's a senior, he's so beautiful.

1352
00:56:31,589 --> 00:56:33,055
是个富二代
 (both chuckle)

1353
00:56:33,057 --> 00:56:35,657
 Um, he's a... richie.

1354
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:37,393
- 啥代? - 富二代 这真蠢
 A whatie?

1355
00:56:37,395 --> 00:56:39,461
 A richie, it's kind of stupid.

1356
00:56:39,463 --> 00:56:41,830
就是他家挺有钱的
 It's just his family has a lot of money.

1357
00:56:41,832 --> 00:56:43,432
- 这有问题吗 - 不知道 就是感觉很怪
 Oh, well, is that a problem?

1358
00:56:43,434 --> 00:56:44,933
 I don't know, it's just weird.

1359
00:56:44,935 --> 00:56:46,935
他的朋友很有钱 他也有钱
 You know, his friends have a lot of money,

1360
00:56:46,937 --> 00:56:49,004
他开宝马
 and he has a lot of money.

1361
00:56:49,006 --> 00:56:50,105
 He drives a BMW.

1362
00:56:50,107 --> 00:56:53,742
我就是… 不知道… 我不知道他能不能接受我
 I don't know, I'm not really sure if they're gonna accept me.

1363
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:56,779
 Well, what does that mean?

1364
00:56:56,781 --> 00:56:58,881
这什么意思 你们互相喜欢
 I mean, you like him, he likes you.

1365
00:56:58,883 --> 00:57:01,450
他朋友怎么想根本不重要
What his friends think shouldn't make any difference.

1366
00:57:01,452 --> 00:57:04,052
是的 但我的朋友也这样 大家都这样
 Yeah, but it's not just his friends, it's my friends, too.

1367
00:57:04,054 --> 00:57:08,524
我觉得没有安全感
 It's everybody. I'm just not real... secure about it.

1368
00:57:08,526 --> 00:57:09,958
抓紧享受
 Well, so take the heat.

1369
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:14,062
你喜欢他 他喜欢你 这就值了
 I mean, you like him, he likes you; it's worth it.

1370
00:57:14,064 --> 00:57:14,897
- 是吗 - 难道不是吗
 Is it?

1371
00:57:14,899 --> 00:57:17,166
 Well, isn't it?

1372
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:20,536
你说的对
 You're right.

1373
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:23,605
- 我是过虑了 对吧 - 不必这样的
 I'm just overreacting, aren't I?

1374
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:25,040
深情的一吻能扰乱任何人的内心
 Oh, not necessarily.

1375
00:57:25,042 --> 00:57:27,643
 I mean, a good kiss can scramble

1376
00:57:27,645 --> 00:57:29,711
anybody's brain.

1377
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:32,948
不用担心 明天看看会是怎样
 Look, just don't worry about it, you know?

1378
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,584
 And wait and see how you feel tomorrow.

1379
00:57:35,586 --> 00:57:36,819
- 晚安 - 晚安 谢谢
Good night, hon.

1380
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:38,587
 Good night. Thanks.

1381
00:57:38,589 --> 00:57:41,056
这才是我的宝贝
That's my baby.

1382
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:45,661
亲爱的
 Uh, honey.

1383
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:48,230
等一下 我问你点事
 Uh, would you-- wait a minute.

1384
00:57:48,232 --> 00:57:49,998
好的
Could-could I ask you something?

1385
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,701
 Yeah.

1386
00:57:53,603 --> 00:57:56,605
有时我觉得有点抱歉
 Uh... sometimes I feel a little sorry

1387
00:57:56,607 --> 00:58:01,243
这样的事情你得跟我说
 that, um, I'm the one you have to talk to about these things.

1388
00:58:01,245 --> 00:58:02,478
我没觉得 别人说的也没你好
 I'm not.

1389
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,681
 She couldn't have said it any better than you.

1390
00:58:05,683 --> 00:58:07,749
- 我是说真的 - 晚安
 I mean it.

1391
00:58:07,751 --> 00:58:10,152
 Good night.

1392
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:33,575
 (mid-tempo rock beat playing)

1393
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:09,011
好的 来丰富我吧
 Okay, make my day.

1394
00:59:09,013 --> 00:59:11,880
我要听所有的细节
 I want all the gory details.

1395
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:12,881
交融的呼吸 跳动的内心 潮湿的窗户
 The mingling breath,

1396
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:16,285
the pounding heart, the steamy windows.

1397
00:59:16,287 --> 00:59:17,819
全部对我说
I want the whole scoop.

1398
00:59:17,821 --> 00:59:19,621
我不想让你失望 但什么都没发生
 Well, I hate to disappoint you,

1399
00:59:19,623 --> 00:59:22,257
 but nothing happened.

1400
00:59:22,259 --> 00:59:23,559
闹太套?
Nothing?

1401
00:59:23,561 --> 00:59:28,130
也不是完全没有 我吻了他
 Well, not nothing, I mean, I kissed him.

1402
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:31,166
- 有劲爆的吗 - 好了
 Anywhere interesting?

1403
00:59:31,168 --> 00:59:33,268
 Oh, please.

1404
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:34,937
所以…
 So...

1405
00:59:34,939 --> 00:59:36,605
他的嘴唇有力吗
 uh...

1406
00:59:36,607 --> 00:59:40,208
 does he have strong lips?

1407
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:41,610
- 这要怎么判断 - 你的膝盖感觉到了吗
 How can you tell?

1408
00:59:41,612 --> 00:59:44,046
 Do you feel it in your knees?

1409
00:59:44,048 --> 00:59:46,315
- 我全身都感觉到了 - 给力的嘴唇
 I felt it everywhere.

1410
00:59:46,317 --> 00:59:49,318
 Strong lips.

1411
00:59:52,855 --> 00:59:54,856
说说嘴唇!
(Iona laughs)

1412
00:59:54,858 --> 00:59:56,992
 Talk about lips.

1413
00:59:56,994 --> 00:59:57,726
我老的可以当他妈 但当唐老鸭亲我时
 (laughing)

1414
00:59:57,728 --> 01:00:00,762
 I mean, I'm old enough to be his mother,

1415
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:01,663
 but when the Duck laid

1416
01:00:01,665 --> 01:00:03,165
我发誓 我全身都被烧灼了
 that kiss on me last night,

1417
01:00:03,167 --> 01:00:03,865
 I swear

1418
01:00:03,867 --> 01:00:06,935
 to God, my thighs just went up in flames.

1419
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:10,772
他肯定是在甜瓜上练习过了
 He must practice on melons, or something.

1420
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:12,741
这是你的舞会礼服?
 This your prom dress?

1421
01:00:12,743 --> 01:00:14,710
 (laughs)

1422
01:00:14,712 --> 01:00:16,345
- 信不信随你 - 真好看
 Believe it or not.

1423
01:00:16,347 --> 01:00:18,647
 It's great.

1424
01:00:18,649 --> 01:00:20,382
- 好傻 - 面料很好
 It's silly.

1425
01:00:20,384 --> 01:00:23,218
 It's great material.

1426
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:26,622
要知道 我要去
 You know, I'm going...

1427
01:00:26,624 --> 01:00:28,790
去毕业舞会
to prom.

1428
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:31,159
- 好了! - 不 我要去
 Stop it!

1429
01:00:31,161 --> 01:00:33,662
 (giggling): Well, I am.

1430
01:00:33,664 --> 01:00:35,230
昨晚他问我了 我也不知道 我答应了
 Last night he asked me.

1431
01:00:35,232 --> 01:00:37,766
 And I don't know, I said yes.

1432
01:00:37,768 --> 01:00:40,402
真的好怪啊
 It's really weird.

1433
01:00:40,404 --> 01:00:43,372
但可能挺好玩的
 But it might be kind of fun.

1434
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:47,009
你来了15分钟了 现在才告诉我
IONA: You were here for 15 minutes

1435
01:00:47,011 --> 01:00:48,243
and you didn't even tell me!

1436
01:00:48,245 --> 01:00:52,414
我真的非常想去
 ANDIE: Oh, but I really, really wanted to go.

1437
01:00:52,416 --> 01:00:54,983
 (giggles)

1438
01:00:57,387 --> 01:01:00,322
你真走运
 You lucky girl.

1439
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:05,961
 ? Cherish is the word I use to describe... ?

1440
01:01:05,963 --> 01:01:09,031
这就是梦幻礼服?
 Isn't that a dreamy dress?

1441
01:01:09,033 --> 01:01:10,832
 ? All the feeling

1442
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:15,937
 ? That I have hiding here for you inside ?

1443
01:01:15,939 --> 01:01:20,876
 ? You don't know how many times I've wished ?

1444
01:01:20,878 --> 01:01:22,010
 ? That I had told you

1445
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:24,780
 ? You don't know how many times I've wished ?

1446
01:01:24,782 --> 01:01:26,348
- 罗娜 我得走了 - 在这首歌唱完之前拉住我好吗
 ? That I could hold you...

1447
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:27,382
 Iona, I have to go.

1448
01:01:27,384 --> 01:01:30,185
Can you just hold till this song is over?

1449
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:32,688
但我得走了
 But I have to leave.

1450
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:39,227
我们能不能返老还童一点
Oh, why can't we start old and get younger?

1451
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:43,298
我嫉妒你 我嫉妒死你了!
 ? Cherish is the word...

1452
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:45,167
 I envy you.

1453
01:01:45,169 --> 01:01:48,737
I really envy you!

1454
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:52,240
罗娜 你怀旧过度了
 Iona, you're gonna O.D. on nostalgia.

1455
01:01:52,242 --> 01:01:55,944
我喜欢《山水又相逢》
I loved "The Big Chill".

1456
01:01:55,946 --> 01:01:58,380
- 我爱这条裙子 - 真漂亮
I love this dress.

1457
01:01:58,382 --> 01:02:00,248
是的
 It's a great dress.

1458
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,883
我妈给我买的 她非常开心
 Yeah.

1459
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:04,086
My mother bought it for me.

1460
01:02:04,088 --> 01:02:06,455
God, she was so happy.

1461
01:02:06,457 --> 01:02:07,456
我看起来正常 这是第一次也是最后一次
It was the first

1462
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:09,825
and last time I ever looked normal.

1463
01:02:09,827 --> 01:02:12,060
我是指相对来说
I mean, you know, relatively speaking.

1464
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:13,228
要是我的约会对像不是唯一一个可以钓到的 俩孩子的爸
It would have been a fairy tale

1465
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:16,398
if my date hadn't been the only one at the prom

1466
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,766
那就完美了
 with a...

1467
01:02:17,768 --> 01:02:20,302
wife and two kids.

1468
01:02:20,304 --> 01:02:22,971
想试试吗 你穿上一定好看
 You want to try it on?

1469
01:02:22,973 --> 01:02:25,207
 I bet it'd look great on you.

1470
01:02:25,209 --> 01:02:28,076
你的屁股比我年轻15岁
I mean, your butt is 15 years younger than mine.

1471
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:31,012
我以前也有翘臀 我爱我的屁股 真希望当时拍照留念了
I mean, I used to have a great butt.

1472
01:02:31,014 --> 01:02:32,013
 I did!

1473
01:02:32,015 --> 01:02:32,981
I loved my butt!

1474
01:02:32,983 --> 01:02:34,416
- 想试试这件吗 - 不了 等等吧
I wish I had photographs of it.

1475
01:02:34,418 --> 01:02:35,751
You want to try this on?

1476
01:02:35,753 --> 01:02:36,752
你要走了 我知道 我自己准备好
 Mm, nah, not right now.

1477
01:02:36,754 --> 01:02:39,488
Oh, yeah, you gotta go, I know.

1478
01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:40,789
I know.

1479
01:02:40,791 --> 01:02:41,523
- 你要出去? - 是的 新人
I gotta get ready myself.

1480
01:02:41,525 --> 01:02:43,525
 You're going out? Yeah.

1481
01:02:43,527 --> 01:02:44,359
 New guy.

1482
01:02:44,361 --> 01:02:48,230
特伦丝 开宠物店的
Terrance, he owns a pet shop.

1483
01:02:48,232 --> 01:02:50,265
看看进展如何
We'll see what happens.

1484
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:52,000
- 帮我挤白马王子一下 - 我会的
 (giggles)

1485
01:02:52,002 --> 01:02:52,534
 Have fun.

1486
01:02:52,536 --> 01:02:55,103
 Give Mr. Perfecto a squeeze

1487
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:57,239
 for me. Oh, I will.

1488
01:02:57,241 --> 01:02:59,007
听着
Hey, listen, uh,

1489
01:02:59,009 --> 01:03:02,277
要是见到你的小唐老鸭 对他好一点
if you see your little Duck Man...

1490
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:02,878
他受伤不轻
be kind.

1491
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,214
He's nursing some fairly serious wounds.

1492
01:03:06,216 --> 01:03:08,250
- 好吗 - 好
 Okay?

1493
01:03:08,252 --> 01:03:10,819
 Okay.

1494
01:03:10,821 --> 01:03:12,521
- 拜拜 - 拜
 Bye-bye.

1495
01:03:12,523 --> 01:03:14,923
 Bye.

1496
01:03:15,558 --> 01:03:18,894
我们去吃寿司
Hey, you know, we're going for, uh, sushi.

1497
01:03:18,896 --> 01:03:22,531
你觉得这样太过分了?
 Do you think this is too much?

1498
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,034
再见
 Bye.

1499
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:30,539
? You don't know how many times I've wished that I... ?

1500
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:33,074
我觉得你昨晚非常不好
 Thought that was very uncool of you

1501
01:03:33,076 --> 01:03:35,844
- 什么? - "什么"!
 last night, Blane. What?

1502
01:03:35,846 --> 01:03:37,145
- 你是指安迪? - 我就是指安迪
 What?

1503
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:38,880
You mean Andie?

1504
01:03:38,882 --> 01:03:39,915
怎么了 我喜欢她
 Yeah, I mean Andie.

1505
01:03:39,917 --> 01:03:41,316
What's the big deal, I like her.

1506
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:42,184
说实话 我有点生气你们对她不友好
 As a matter of fact,

1507
01:03:42,186 --> 01:03:44,820
 I was pissed off at you guys for being so nasty

1508
01:03:44,822 --> 01:03:46,454
你私自带她来派对 这样不好
to her. It was way out of order

1509
01:03:46,456 --> 01:03:48,590
 for you to foist her on the party.

1510
01:03:48,592 --> 01:03:50,492
什泰夫 你听到你说的话了 你说的是我听到的屁话吗
 Steff, do you hear yourself?

1511
01:03:50,494 --> 01:03:52,527
 You hear the same asshole shit I hear?

1512
01:03:52,529 --> 01:03:55,397
- 我还得给你讲清楚吗 布兰? - 是吧
What, do I have to spell it out for you, Blane?

1513
01:03:55,399 --> 01:03:56,131
没人欣赏你的幽默感
 I guess so.

1514
01:03:56,133 --> 01:03:58,934
 Nobody appreciates your sense of humor, you know.

1515
01:03:58,936 --> 01:04:02,070
事实上 大家都恶心的要命
 As a matter of fact, everybody is just about to puke from it.

1516
01:04:02,072 --> 01:04:03,471
要是你喜欢垃圾 别带到我们面前来 行吗 伙计
 You know, if you've got a hard-on

1517
01:04:03,473 --> 01:04:05,173
 for trash, don't take care of it

1518
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:07,142
好的 兄弟
 around us, pal, all right?

1519
01:04:07,144 --> 01:04:08,310
 Right, buddy.

1520
01:04:08,312 --> 01:04:08,910
我这次真的不要过度 布兰 真的不用
 Listen,

1521
01:04:08,912 --> 01:04:11,446
 I don't need a lot of shit on this one, Blane,

1522
01:04:11,448 --> 01:04:12,981
 all right? I really don't.

1523
01:04:12,983 --> 01:04:15,951
 Money all that matters to you?

1524
01:04:15,953 --> 01:04:17,485
- 钱就是你关心的一切? - 这话从何说起?
 Wh-Where in the hell does that come from?

1525
01:04:17,487 --> 01:04:21,423
你看看 要是我缺钱 我还能把我爹妈的房子弄成这样?
 Well, look around you, would I treat my parents house like this

1526
01:04:21,425 --> 01:04:23,024
 if I, if money was any

1527
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:23,625
为什么要这样 直接推倒完事
 kind of issue?

1528
01:04:23,627 --> 01:04:24,960
 Well, wh-why are you doing this?

1529
01:04:24,962 --> 01:04:26,962
 You know, why don't you just nail her

1530
01:04:26,964 --> 01:04:27,996
- 怎么还投入感情了? - 这样有什么问题?
 and get it over with.

1531
01:04:27,998 --> 01:04:29,431
 You know, why are you getting involved?

1532
01:04:29,433 --> 01:04:30,966
我就是觉得这样很蠢 没意义
 Is there something wrong with that?

1533
01:04:30,968 --> 01:04:32,234
 I just think it's stupid.

1534
01:04:32,236 --> 01:04:33,268
- 我觉得你父母会很高兴的 - 他们跟此事无关
 You know, it's pointless.

1535
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:34,502
 you know, and your parents,

1536
01:04:34,504 --> 01:04:35,971
 I think they'll be thrilled.

1537
01:04:35,973 --> 01:04:37,305
They have nothing to do with it.

1538
01:04:37,307 --> 01:04:38,206
我看到你妈对你的期望了 布兰 这很不好
 Really? Yeah.

1539
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:40,642
I've seen your mother go to work on you, Blane.

1540
01:04:40,644 --> 01:04:41,576
等比尔和乔易斯跟你练完
 You know, it's vicious!

1541
01:04:41,578 --> 01:04:44,246
 And when Bill and Joyce get through with you,

1542
01:04:44,248 --> 01:04:46,047
你就不知道是什么下场了
 you won't know whether to shit

1543
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:46,615
 or go sailing.

1544
01:04:46,617 --> 01:04:51,186
这谈话无聊透了 布兰
 Listen, I, I'm getting really bored with this conversation.

1545
01:04:51,188 --> 01:04:52,087
要是你想找个低等小妞玩玩 没问题
 All right, Blane.

1546
01:04:52,089 --> 01:04:55,257
 You know, if you want your little piece of low-grade ass,

1547
01:04:55,259 --> 01:04:56,024
但要是你这么做了 你就没朋友了
 fine, take it,

1548
01:04:56,026 --> 01:04:57,092
 you know, but if you do,

1549
01:04:57,094 --> 01:04:58,894
- 是这样吗 - 是这样的
 you're not gonna have a friend.

1550
01:04:58,896 --> 01:04:59,561
 Is that right?

1551
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:01,162
 Yeah, that's right.

1552
01:05:01,164 --> 01:05:03,465
要是你想做选择 选吧
 I mean, if you want to make the choice,

1553
01:05:03,467 --> 01:05:04,666
 go ahead and make it, all right?

1554
01:05:04,668 --> 01:05:08,136
我个人是不会据此而断绝友谊的 但我很老派 所以…
 I, I personally wouldn't trash a friendship over it,

1555
01:05:08,138 --> 01:05:11,139
 but... hey, I'm old-fashioned.

1556
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:11,573
洗个澡吧 你丑死了
 So...

1557
01:05:11,575 --> 01:05:15,377
 Why don't you take a shower; you look like shit.

1558
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:18,380
要是两星期前 有人说我会跟你出去
 ANDIE: <i>Two weeks ago,</i>

1559
01:05:18,382 --> 01:05:19,347
 <i>if somebody told me</i>

1560
01:05:19,349 --> 01:05:20,548
我肯定不会相信的
 <i>that I'd be going out with you,</i>

1561
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:22,517
 <i>I never would have</i> <i>believed them.</i>

1562
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:23,485
- 为什么 我没那么坏 - 是的 但是…
 BLANE: <i>Why?</i>

1563
01:05:23,487 --> 01:05:24,986
 <i>I'm not all that bad.</i>

1564
01:05:24,988 --> 01:05:26,021
我跟你呢?
 <i>No, but...</i>

1565
01:05:26,023 --> 01:05:27,989
 <i>What about me and you?</i>

1566
01:05:29,158 --> 01:05:30,659
你没见过或交谈过的人会成为你的敌人 简直是有病
 You know, it's so insane

1567
01:05:30,661 --> 01:05:32,160
 that somebody you've never met,

1568
01:05:32,162 --> 01:05:36,097
 never talked to can be your enemy.

1569
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:41,102
Mm... yeah.

1570
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:41,156
是的

1571
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:47,609
那你不该见我的父母
You shouldn't meet my parents, then.

1572
01:05:47,611 --> 01:05:48,944
好的
 (laughs)

1573
01:05:48,946 --> 01:05:50,045
 Okay.

1574
01:05:50,047 --> 01:05:53,381
他们也不是魔鬼 不过…
Well, I mean, they're not ogres, but...

1575
01:05:53,383 --> 01:05:55,650
 (both laugh)

1576
01:05:56,018 --> 01:05:59,287
我觉得他们还是喜欢包办婚姻
I think they still believe in arranged marriages.

1577
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:02,590
企业家族代替皇室家族
Corporate families replaced royal families.

1578
01:06:02,592 --> 01:06:07,095
我是多诺电气的加冕王子
I'm the crowned prince of McDonnough Electric.

1579
01:06:07,097 --> 01:06:09,664
- 跑题了 - 没有
 It's irrelevant.

1580
01:06:09,666 --> 01:06:12,133
 No.

1581
01:06:15,071 --> 01:06:17,372
是的
 Yeah.

1582
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:22,277
- 我想让他们去死 - 那就让他们去死
I could just tell them all to go to hell.

1583
01:06:22,279 --> 01:06:23,445
- 大家都是 朋友们 父母 - 每一个人
 Tell them to go to hell.

1584
01:06:23,447 --> 01:06:24,646
Everyone, friends, parents.

1585
01:06:24,648 --> 01:06:27,515
 All of them. All of them.

1586
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:30,518
你呢
What about you?

1587
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:31,319
要是别人不信我 那我也不信他
 Hmm?

1588
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:34,255
 Somebody doesn't believe in me, I...

1589
01:06:34,257 --> 01:06:37,058
 I can't believe in them.

1590
01:06:39,195 --> 01:06:41,363
你不撒谎 是不是
You don't lie, do you?

1591
01:06:41,365 --> 01:06:44,099
我不必撒谎
 I don't have to lie.

1592
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:52,507
总会发生的
This is gonna happen.

1593
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:56,478
我很希望能发生
Okay, I really want this to happen.

1594
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:33,381
是的
 Yeah.

1595
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:55,570
 (distant train passing)

1596
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:59,607
 ? So, please, please, please

1597
01:07:59,609 --> 01:08:03,378
 ? Let me, let me, let me

1598
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:08,550
 ? Let me get what I want...

1599
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:25,500
- 能帮你吗 - 我很好 谢谢
 Can I help you?

1600
01:08:25,502 --> 01:08:27,168
- 毕业舞会的东西 - 随便看看
I'm fine, thank you.

1601
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:28,870
 Something for the prom?

1602
01:08:28,872 --> 01:08:29,804
要是你有什么需要…
Just looking.

1603
01:08:29,806 --> 01:08:34,109
 Yeah, well, if you need anything, uh...

1604
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:55,897
- 真难看 - 非常合适
 (sighs)

1605
01:08:55,899 --> 01:08:56,865
 This is trash.

1606
01:08:56,867 --> 01:08:59,300
MOTHER: It's very becoming.

1607
01:08:59,302 --> 01:08:59,834
妈妈 看着像是我站在结婚蛋糕上似的
 Mother, it looks

1608
01:08:59,836 --> 01:09:02,704
like I should be standing on top of a wedding cake.

1609
01:09:02,706 --> 01:09:04,906
宝贝 好了
Oh, darling, don't I wish.

1610
01:09:04,908 --> 01:09:06,641
我讨厌这面料 还有 我最受不了浅蓝色
 And I hate this material

1611
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:10,445
 and by the way, I cannot stand baby blue.

1612
01:09:10,447 --> 01:09:13,882
 (phone rings)

1613
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:25,360
 (phone continues ringing)

1614
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:27,629
- 知道他在哪儿吗 - 对不起 他没告诉我
 Well, do you know where he is?

1615
01:09:27,631 --> 01:09:28,730
 WOMAN: No, I'm sorry,

1616
01:09:28,732 --> 01:09:30,365
 he didn't tell me where he was going.

1617
01:09:30,367 --> 01:09:32,567
要是他打电话或是回家来 让他联系我好吗
 Okay, well, then if he calls or comes home

1618
01:09:32,569 --> 01:09:34,402
- 你是谁 - 安迪
 can you just tell him to call me?

1619
01:09:34,404 --> 01:09:36,237
- 谁 - 安迪
 Who is this, please? Andie.

1620
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:36,905
- 好吧 能留下号码吗 - 他知道
 Who? Andie!

1621
01:09:36,907 --> 01:09:38,706
 Well, yes, could I have your number?

1622
01:09:38,708 --> 01:09:39,741
- 好吧 我给他写个条 宝贝 - 好的 谢了 再见
 Yeah, no, he has the number.

1623
01:09:39,743 --> 01:09:41,843
 Well, fine, I'll leave him a note, dear.

1624
01:09:41,845 --> 01:09:44,379
 Okay, thanks. Bye.

1625
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:47,649
他到底在哪儿
 (sighs)

1626
01:09:47,651 --> 01:09:50,418
 Where in the hell is he?

1627
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:52,520
(dog panting)

1628
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:54,222
 (sighs)

1629
01:09:54,224 --> 01:09:57,258
不要爱上一个人 你不会喜欢的
 Never fall in love, Ace, you just won't like it.

1630
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:59,928
这很复杂
 It's very complicated.

1631
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:26,588
安迪!
 Andie?

1632
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:34,696
安迪!
 Andie!

1633
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:38,466
- 安迪! - 进来
 (knocking on door) Andie.

1634
01:10:38,468 --> 01:10:40,668
 Come in.

1635
01:10:41,003 --> 01:10:43,504
- 嗨 - 嗨 老爸
 Hi. Hi, Daddy.

1636
01:10:43,506 --> 01:10:45,640
我有东西给你
 I brought you something.

1637
01:10:45,642 --> 01:10:46,407
- 是什么 - 我给你买的一点小东西
What is it?

1638
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:49,477
 Well, it's a little something I picked up

1639
01:10:49,479 --> 01:10:51,246
 for you.

1640
01:10:51,248 --> 01:10:52,013
 ? Ta-tah.

1641
01:10:52,015 --> 01:10:53,681
有点旧 但我知道要是你有心 可以做出很美的东西来
 I know it's a little busy,

1642
01:10:53,683 --> 01:10:56,384
 but I know you can make something out of it.

1643
01:10:56,386 --> 01:10:57,652
 If you need to.

1644
01:10:57,654 --> 01:10:58,886
- 喜欢吗 - 这颜色真漂亮
 Wow. Yeah.

1645
01:10:58,888 --> 01:11:00,021
 Do you like it?

1646
01:11:00,023 --> 01:11:01,723
It's a beautiful color.

1647
01:11:01,725 --> 01:11:03,691
 Yeah. It's really pretty.

1648
01:11:03,693 --> 01:11:06,261
天哪 让我想到了你妈妈
 God, it reminds me so much of your mom.

1649
01:11:06,263 --> 01:11:09,464
她最爱粉红色 她穿粉色特别漂亮
 You know, she always wore pink.

1650
01:11:09,466 --> 01:11:10,999
 And she looked

1651
01:11:11,001 --> 01:11:12,300
- 挺好的 谢谢 - 好的
 so beautiful in it.

1652
01:11:12,302 --> 01:11:13,534
 It's okay.

1653
01:11:13,536 --> 01:11:15,503
 Okay. Thank you.

1654
01:11:15,505 --> 01:11:17,505
 Okay.

1655
01:11:17,507 --> 01:11:18,906
- 爸爸 - 怎么
 Daddy.

1656
01:11:18,908 --> 01:11:19,574
 What?

1657
01:11:19,576 --> 01:11:22,910
我想让你知道我真的很喜欢
 I just want you to know I really appreciate this.

1658
01:11:22,912 --> 01:11:27,282
我觉得我可以做点东西出来
 I think I can make something out of it.

1659
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:30,518
- 我能问个问题吗 - 可以 说吧
 Can I ask you something?

1660
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:31,719
 Sure.

1661
01:11:31,721 --> 01:11:33,621
 What?

1662
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:37,558
你从哪弄的钱买这个
 Where'd you get the money to pay for this?

1663
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,894
不贵的 我也有些钱
Well, why, it wasn't that much.

1664
01:11:39,896 --> 01:11:41,396
- 新工作赚的? - 是的 新工作
 I had some money.

1665
01:11:41,398 --> 01:11:42,397
 From your new job?

1666
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:45,833
 Ah, yeah, from my new job.

1667
01:11:45,835 --> 01:11:46,868
我周三上班前回过家 你的车还在
 (sighs)

1668
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:48,569
 I came home before work on Wednesday

1669
01:11:48,571 --> 01:11:50,571
 and your car was in the driveway.

1670
01:11:50,573 --> 01:11:51,639
 Mm-hmm.

1671
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:54,008
- 你不必骗我的 - 不
 You know, you didn't have to lie to me.

1672
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:55,343
- 你不必的! - 就是 我没去面试
 Yes, I did. No, you didn't.

1673
01:11:55,345 --> 01:11:57,312
 Yes, I did. I had a line on something

1674
01:11:57,314 --> 01:11:58,313
- 为什么不去 - 忘了
 and I missed the appointment.

1675
01:11:58,315 --> 01:11:59,681
 Oh, why'd you miss the appointment?

1676
01:11:59,683 --> 01:12:00,782
不是这样的 你根本不想工作
 It slipped my mind.

1677
01:12:00,784 --> 01:12:01,849
 It didn't slip your mind.

1678
01:12:01,851 --> 01:12:02,817
你去见顾问是因为那是他们让你去的
 You didn't want the job.

1679
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:04,519
 You just went to the counselor because I forced you to.

1680
01:12:04,521 --> 01:12:06,688
- 你想说什么 安迪? - 我想说你只是没去而已
Am I right? Yeah, what's your point, Andie?!

1681
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:08,823
My point is, you just didn't go!

1682
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:10,925
- 我故意不去面试? - 是的
You saying I deliberately missed

1683
01:12:10,927 --> 01:12:11,959
 the appointment? Yes.

1684
01:12:11,961 --> 01:12:15,463
你就这么想我?
 Is this how you feel about me?

1685
01:12:15,465 --> 01:12:16,864
是的
 (sighs)

1686
01:12:16,866 --> 01:12:17,832
 Yes.

1687
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:20,835
- 我本来还不知道 - 现在你知道了
 Well, I didn't know this.

1688
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:21,903
 Well, now you do.

1689
01:12:21,905 --> 01:12:24,706
你现在知道了一切是吧 你18岁还有奖学金
 Oh, you know everything, now, huh?

1690
01:12:24,708 --> 01:12:25,606
 You're 18

1691
01:12:25,608 --> 01:12:26,708
 and you got a scholarship

1692
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:28,776
- 这不公平 - 我很笨 给不了你任何东西
 and, uh, you're, uh, That's not fair!

1693
01:12:28,778 --> 01:12:29,711
 all grown-up and free,

1694
01:12:29,713 --> 01:12:31,679
 and I'm just an ignorant son of a bitch who never

1695
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:33,581
- 我没要求过什么! - 太有才了
 gave you anything. Hey, I never asked

1696
01:12:33,583 --> 01:12:34,882
你为什么不能忘了她?
 Oh, that's brilliant!

1697
01:12:34,884 --> 01:12:36,751
Why can't you just forget her?!

1698
01:12:36,753 --> 01:12:38,553
- 你上学要迟到了 - 不 别走开
 It's late; you got school.

1699
01:12:38,555 --> 01:12:40,521
- 你听我说完好吗 - 我已经听够了
No, don't walk out on this!

1700
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:41,489
Will you please just

1701
01:12:41,491 --> 01:12:42,457
 listen to me?! Please?!

1702
01:12:42,459 --> 01:12:43,825
是的 你每天都这么想
I've already been through this, Andie!

1703
01:12:43,827 --> 01:12:45,126
 Sure, you go through it every day!

1704
01:12:45,128 --> 01:12:46,527
你为什么认不清呢 她已经走了 永远也不会回来了
 You're still going through it!

1705
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:48,596
 Why can't you just realize that she's gone

1706
01:12:48,598 --> 01:12:50,365
 and she's not gonna come back?!

1707
01:12:50,367 --> 01:12:52,433
- 她永远也不会回来了! - 闭嘴!
 She's never coming back!

1708
01:12:52,435 --> 01:12:53,067
你为什么不接受现实 她走了 她…
Shut up! Dad...

1709
01:12:53,069 --> 01:12:55,503
Goddamn it! why can't you accept it?!

1710
01:12:55,505 --> 01:12:57,038
 She's just gone!

1711
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:57,905
你为什么不接受?
 She...

1712
01:12:57,907 --> 01:13:01,376
Why can't you accept it?

1713
01:13:01,378 --> 01:13:04,779
因为…
 Because... I love her.

1714
01:13:04,781 --> 01:13:05,646
我爱她 这就是原因
That's why.

1715
01:13:05,648 --> 01:13:08,583
我也爱她 你知道的
 Well, I loved her, too, you know.

1716
01:13:08,585 --> 01:13:10,752
 (crying)

1717
01:13:10,754 --> 01:13:13,855
但她就是不爱我们
 She just didn't love us back.

1718
01:13:14,723 --> 01:13:17,425
(sighs)

1719
01:13:18,794 --> 01:13:20,094
她试过了 我也不知道 她就是不能爱我们
Okay, she tried.

1720
01:13:20,096 --> 01:13:21,095
I don't know.

1721
01:13:21,097 --> 01:13:23,131
She just couldn't handle it.

1722
01:13:23,133 --> 01:13:26,401
是的 但我知道 我一直都知道
Yeah, but I... I-I knew it.

1723
01:13:26,403 --> 01:13:27,635
我五岁时就感觉到了
I knew it all along.

1724
01:13:27,637 --> 01:13:30,471
I mean, when I was five, I felt it.

1725
01:13:30,473 --> 01:13:33,908
还记得她那次没回家吗?
Remember when she didn't come home that time?

1726
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:36,544
我当时就知道了 我知道原因 我14岁时就知道了
I knew it then, I knew why.

1727
01:13:36,546 --> 01:13:38,079
你都50了 可还是不知道
I was 14, and I knew it.

1728
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:39,747
You were 50, and you didn't.

1729
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:43,851
要知道 你不能老是活在回忆里
You know, you can't go on living every day in the past.

1730
01:13:43,853 --> 01:13:46,888
她抛下了我们 不是我们抛弃的她 我们也无能为力
She left us, Daddy. We didn't leave her.

1731
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:48,923
There was nothing we could do about it.

1732
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:50,091
It just happened.

1733
01:13:50,093 --> 01:13:52,560
 (sighs)

1734
01:13:52,828 --> 01:13:54,762
女儿啥时候比老爸知道的还多了?
 Since when is the daughter supposed

1735
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:57,832
 to know more than her father?

1736
01:13:57,834 --> 01:13:58,933
 (chuckles)

1737
01:13:58,935 --> 01:13:59,634
我就是个傻逼
 (sniffles)

1738
01:13:59,636 --> 01:14:01,903
 I've just been a blind fool.

1739
01:14:01,905 --> 01:14:02,537
你是个要刮胡子的傻逼
 (sighs)

1740
01:14:02,539 --> 01:14:06,674
And you're a blind fool that needs a shave, too.

1741
01:14:06,676 --> 01:14:09,177
我是得刮胡子了
 And I need a shave.

1742
01:14:09,179 --> 01:14:11,045
呃…
 (sighs heavily)

1743
01:14:11,047 --> 01:14:12,513
 Well...

1744
01:14:12,515 --> 01:14:13,714
你上床睡觉吧 明天要上学
 (sighs)

1745
01:14:13,716 --> 01:14:15,149
 You'd better get to bed.

1746
01:14:15,151 --> 01:14:16,050
我也得休息 明天我也有事要做
 You got school.

1747
01:14:16,052 --> 01:14:17,218
 And I got to hit the hay, too,

1748
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:21,889
 'cause I got a few things that I got to do tomorrow.

1749
01:14:21,891 --> 01:14:23,124
好的
 Okay?

1750
01:14:23,126 --> 01:14:25,560
 Okay.

1751
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:30,598
我应该可以给你搞双鞋 但我不知道你穿几号
 Uh, I would have got you some shoes,

1752
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:34,068
 but I didn't know your size.

1753
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:38,039
 (door closes)

1754
01:14:58,727 --> 01:15:00,995
 (crying)

1755
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:04,232
 (sniffles and sighs)

1756
01:15:04,633 --> 01:15:36,764
 ?

1757
01:15:36,766 --> 01:15:39,600
 (class bell rings)

1758
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:50,177
嘿 玛丽
 How you doing?

1759
01:15:53,782 --> 01:15:56,250
 (indistinct crowd chatter)

1760
01:16:09,164 --> 01:16:10,932
- 你好吗 - 你怎么不给我打电话
 How you doing?

1761
01:16:10,934 --> 01:16:12,199
Why haven't you called me?

1762
01:16:12,201 --> 01:16:13,801
我的平衡有点问题 马夫看到我们了 这违反俱乐部规则
 Oh, I got nailed for the stable thing.

1763
01:16:13,803 --> 01:16:16,337
 I guess a groom saw us. It's against club rules.

1764
01:16:16,339 --> 01:16:20,274
我给你打了三次电话 还给你留言了
I called you three times, and I left messages.

1765
01:16:20,276 --> 01:16:21,309
是吗 我没收到
 Yeah?

1766
01:16:21,311 --> 01:16:23,678
 Well, I-I didn't get them. My family,

1767
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:26,781
我的家人对此没有责任
 they're very irresponsible about that stuff, you know?

1768
01:16:26,783 --> 01:16:28,983
我今早等你了
I waited for you this morning.

1769
01:16:28,985 --> 01:16:30,785
- 是吗 在哪儿 - 停车场
 Yeah? Where?

1770
01:16:30,787 --> 01:16:32,653
Parking lot.

1771
01:16:33,322 --> 01:16:37,358
我看到你了 我以为你也看到了我
I saw you, and I thought that you saw me.

1772
01:16:38,126 --> 01:16:41,195
没有
 No.

1773
01:16:41,663 --> 01:16:43,731
怎么回事 布兰?
What about prom, Blane?

1774
01:16:43,733 --> 01:16:44,131
 (sighs)

1775
01:16:44,133 --> 01:16:48,903
我今天不舒服 晚点谈好吗
 Oh, Andie, I'm having a bad day. Can we talk later?

1776
01:16:48,905 --> 01:16:49,904
- 不行 毕业舞会怎么办 - 放学后见吧
No. What about prom? Come on.

1777
01:16:49,906 --> 01:16:51,706
- 不 舞会怎么办? - 安迪 好了
 Why don't we just meet after school?

1778
01:16:51,708 --> 01:16:53,741
No! What about prom?!

1779
01:16:53,743 --> 01:16:54,842
- 说吧 - 说什么
 Andie, come on.

1780
01:16:54,844 --> 01:16:55,776
Just say it. What?

1781
01:16:55,778 --> 01:16:58,145
我要听你说
Just say it! I want to hear you

1782
01:16:58,147 --> 01:16:58,813
- 安迪 别这样行吗 - 我要听你说
 say it.

1783
01:16:58,815 --> 01:17:01,916
 BLANE: Andie, please, all right?

1784
01:17:01,918 --> 01:17:04,652
I want to hear you say it.

1785
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:07,822
一个月前 我邀请了别人却忘了
 A month ago, I asked somebody else,

1786
01:17:07,824 --> 01:17:09,924
你是个骗子 你是个无耻的大骗子!
 and I forgot. You're a liar!

1787
01:17:09,926 --> 01:17:11,158
You're a filthy, fucking, no-good liar!

1788
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:13,628
你根本没胆告诉我真话
You don't have the guts to tell me the truth!

1789
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:15,863
- 你说吧! - 我没撒谎
Just say it! I'm not lying.

1790
01:17:15,865 --> 01:17:16,697
- 告诉! - 你到底想听什么
 Tell me! What?

1791
01:17:16,699 --> 01:17:18,399
 Tell me! What do you want to hear?!

1792
01:17:18,401 --> 01:17:19,967
Just tell me! What?!

1793
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:21,702
- 你觉得跟我在一起很羞耻 - 不 我不害羞
You're ashamed to be seen with me!

1794
01:17:21,704 --> 01:17:22,703
你害怕 你怕你的富朋友们不同意!
 No, I am not, I am not!

1795
01:17:22,705 --> 01:17:23,871
You're ashamed to go out with me!

1796
01:17:23,873 --> 01:17:25,006
You're afraid. No, I'm...

1797
01:17:25,008 --> 01:17:27,375
You're terrified your Goddamn rich friends won't approve!

1798
01:17:27,377 --> 01:17:29,877
就说真话吧!
 Just say it!

1799
01:17:29,879 --> 01:17:33,280
Just tell me the truth!

1800
01:17:33,915 --> 01:17:35,783
 (exhales deeply)

1801
01:17:35,785 --> 01:17:37,084
你不明白这事跟你一点关系也没有
 You don't understand it.

1802
01:17:37,086 --> 01:17:38,719
 It has nothing at all

1803
01:17:38,721 --> 01:17:41,088
 to do with you.

1804
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:41,856
安迪!
 Andie!

1805
01:17:41,858 --> 01:17:43,290
 (footsteps running)

1806
01:17:43,292 --> 01:17:45,893
安迪!
Andie?

1807
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:05,880
算了吧 根本不值得伤心
Forget about it, man.

1808
01:18:05,882 --> 01:18:07,748
It's not worth getting upset over it, you know?

1809
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:09,917
- 为什么不脱下来? - 所有对我这样的女孩
BLANE: Ah, why don't you just take off, Steff, please?

1810
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:12,053
我都不必抓着不放 布兰
 Well, listen, any girl that did that to me,

1811
01:18:12,055 --> 01:18:13,320
 I would not be too jazzed

1812
01:18:13,322 --> 01:18:15,690
to hold on to, Blane.

1813
01:18:15,692 --> 01:18:16,424
不值得 我告诉过你行不通的
It's not worth it, man.

1814
01:18:16,426 --> 01:18:18,826
 I told you, it wasn't gonna work, you know.

1815
01:18:18,828 --> 01:18:22,196
以前 现在和以后的女孩 都一样
 The girl was, is and will always be nada.

1816
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:27,334
 (door opening)

1817
01:18:32,908 --> 01:18:35,810
 (footsteps thudding on stairs)

1818
01:18:53,462 --> 01:18:56,197
有问题吗 朋友?
 You got a problem, friend?

1819
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:01,068
 (scoffs)

1820
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:06,741
 (Duckie yelling)

1821
01:19:06,743 --> 01:19:10,811
 (grunting and groaning)

1822
01:19:11,446 --> 01:19:13,848
 (coughing)

1823
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:14,982
(grunts)

1824
01:19:14,984 --> 01:19:16,117
 Come on.

1825
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:27,328
 (blows landing)

1826
01:19:27,996 --> 01:19:29,363
 (grunting)

1827
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:32,800
没事 没事
All right, all right!

1828
01:19:43,411 --> 01:19:46,046
谢谢
 Nice, huh?

1829
01:19:50,318 --> 01:19:52,820
 ? She was a showgirl (gong-sounding doorbell chimes)

1830
01:19:52,822 --> 01:19:54,255
 ? With yellow feathers in her hair ?

1831
01:19:54,257 --> 01:19:57,992
 ? And a dress cut down to there ? (gong chimes)

1832
01:19:57,994 --> 01:19:59,026
 ? She would merengue

1833
01:19:59,028 --> 01:20:00,294
 IONA: ? And do the cha-cha

1834
01:20:00,296 --> 01:20:01,362
- 安迪? - 是的
 IONA: Cha-cha! Andie?

1835
01:20:01,364 --> 01:20:03,497
 ? And while she tried to be a star... ?

1836
01:20:03,499 --> 01:20:05,800
- 你是安迪 是不是 - 我是
 Yeah? You're Andie, aren't you?

1837
01:20:05,802 --> 01:20:07,101
- 你怎么认识我 - 罗娜告诉我的 我是特伦丝
Yeah, I am.

1838
01:20:07,103 --> 01:20:08,536
Uh, how do you know me?

1839
01:20:08,538 --> 01:20:09,870
 Well, Iona told me.

1840
01:20:09,872 --> 01:20:11,138
 I'm Terrance. Terry.

1841
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:13,274
- 宠物店的是不是 - 是的 之类之类的
 ? They were young and they had each other... ?

1842
01:20:13,276 --> 01:20:14,341
Oh, the pet shop, right?

1843
01:20:14,343 --> 01:20:15,309
她在卧室准备呢 你最好去告诉她时间不多了
 Yeah, among other things.

1844
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:16,577
 She's in the bedroom getting ready.

1845
01:20:16,579 --> 01:20:18,879
 You might want to go in there and tell her

1846
01:20:18,881 --> 01:20:21,248
好的
 to shake her tail feather; we're late.

1847
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:22,983
 Okay.

1848
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:25,886
 ? At the Copa, Copacabana

1849
01:20:25,888 --> 01:20:26,821
罗娜?
 Iona?

1850
01:20:26,823 --> 01:20:30,124
 ? Music and passion were always the fashion ?

1851
01:20:30,126 --> 01:20:31,458
很高兴认识你
 Nice to meet you.

1852
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:34,461
 ? At the Copa

1853
01:20:34,463 --> 01:20:36,230
 ? They fell in love

1854
01:20:36,232 --> 01:20:37,364
 ? <i>Copa</i> ?

1855
01:20:37,366 --> 01:20:38,566
 IONA: ? Copa

1856
01:20:38,568 --> 01:20:42,503
 ? Cabana, a yellow feather

1857
01:20:42,505 --> 01:20:45,573
 ? She was a show girl

1858
01:20:45,575 --> 01:20:47,174
- 罗娜? - 亲爱的 我在这里
 Iona?

1859
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:50,010
 IONA: Hi, honey. I'm in here.

1860
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:53,414
- 敢笑我就杀了你 - 怎么回事
Laugh, and I'll deck ya.

1861
01:20:53,416 --> 01:20:55,416
 What happened?

1862
01:20:55,884 --> 01:20:59,453
我60年代既没嗑这么多药
Either it's all those drugs I took in the '60s,

1863
01:20:59,455 --> 01:21:02,523
我也没在恋爱
or I am really in love.

1864
01:21:02,525 --> 01:21:04,225
 (laughs)

1865
01:21:04,227 --> 01:21:05,893
你到底在想什么
What do you think?

1866
01:21:05,895 --> 01:21:06,527
我只是觉得你很漂亮
Honestly.

1867
01:21:06,529 --> 01:21:09,430
 Honestly, I think you look great.

1868
01:21:09,432 --> 01:21:11,232
- 我跟大妈似的 - 不 是有一点吧 也没关系
Oh, I look like a mother.

1869
01:21:11,234 --> 01:21:13,567
 No. Well, yeah, a little,

1870
01:21:13,569 --> 01:21:17,037
 but that's okay.

1871
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:19,273
你看起来很开心
 You look happy.

1872
01:21:19,275 --> 01:21:21,308
是的
 I am.

1873
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:23,177
挺奇怪的 但是… 你见他了?
It's weird, but I...

1874
01:21:23,179 --> 01:21:24,645
- 是的 - 好
Did you meet him?

1875
01:21:24,647 --> 01:21:26,113
 Yeah.

1876
01:21:26,115 --> 01:21:27,014
他是个雅皮 但人很好
Yeah.

1877
01:21:27,016 --> 01:21:28,148
He's a yuppie,

1878
01:21:28,150 --> 01:21:29,483
but he's so nice.

1879
01:21:29,485 --> 01:21:30,951
他有工作 是异性恋
He's employed, he's heterosexual.

1880
01:21:30,953 --> 01:21:34,355
I swear to God, I'm so far ahead of the game,

1881
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:35,435
我远远领先你 你下次看见我时

1882
01:21:34,357 --> 01:21:36,624
我可能会在挑中国品种了
next time you see me, I'll probably be

1883
01:21:36,626 --> 01:21:38,893
picking out my china patterns.

1884
01:21:38,895 --> 01:21:40,027
(laughs)

1885
01:21:40,029 --> 01:21:41,095
你没事吧 不会吧
 (crying)

1886
01:21:41,097 --> 01:21:42,429
Hey, are you all right?

1887
01:21:42,431 --> 01:21:43,998
No, you're not.

1888
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:44,899
- 是因为你妈妈的事? - 不是
What...

1889
01:21:44,901 --> 01:21:47,034
What, I blow your mind? No?

1890
01:21:47,036 --> 01:21:48,903
男孩的麻烦?
 No, that's not it.

1891
01:21:48,905 --> 01:21:51,438
It's boy trouble?

1892
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:53,040
- 最坏的? - 更厉害
The worst?

1893
01:21:53,042 --> 01:21:54,174
他打发我
 Way beyond.

1894
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:56,543
 He backed out on me.

1895
01:21:56,545 --> 01:22:01,248
他说已经邀请了别人 但他忘了
 He said he asked somebody else, and he forgot about it.

1896
01:22:02,117 --> 01:22:02,549
我真不敢相信
 (crying)

1897
01:22:02,551 --> 01:22:05,920
 I can't believe it, I can't believe it.

1898
01:22:05,922 --> 01:22:08,255
 (sighs)

1899
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:09,957
太丢人了
 I'm so humiliated.

1900
01:22:09,959 --> 01:22:13,460
 I could have killed him! I swear!

1901
01:22:11,471 --> 01:22:13,473
我发誓我要杀了他

1902
01:22:13,462 --> 01:22:17,364
- 我正好赶上了 - 不 别
 You know, I just walked right into it.

1903
01:22:17,366 --> 01:22:19,266
 I know, I know.

1904
01:22:19,268 --> 01:22:20,267
爱情糟透了 是不是
 (sniffles)

1905
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:24,672
 Oh, love is awful, isn't it? Oh.

1906
01:22:26,007 --> 01:22:27,441
还好
It's okay.

1907
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:29,076
 (crying)

1908
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:31,578
 (sniffling)

1909
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:34,315
 (sighs and sniffles)

1910
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:37,384
还记得你说要是我要你舞会的裙子 你就给我
 You remember when I...

1911
01:22:37,386 --> 01:22:38,719
 and when you said that-that, um,

1912
01:22:38,721 --> 01:22:42,289
 if I wanted your prom dress, I could have it?

1913
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:43,290
我想要
 Mm-hmm.

1914
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:44,591
 Well, I need it.

1915
01:22:44,593 --> 01:22:47,027
 I want it.

1916
01:22:47,029 --> 01:22:48,495
- 要来干吗 - 我就是要
 What for?

1917
01:22:48,497 --> 01:22:49,496
 (sighs)

1918
01:22:49,498 --> 01:22:51,131
 I just need it.

1919
01:22:51,133 --> 01:22:52,466
好吧
 (sniffles)

1920
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:54,702
Okay.

1921
01:22:55,537 --> 01:22:58,138
是你的了
It's yours.

1922
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:05,112
 (rhythmic drumbeat)

1923
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:18,125
 (upbeat music playing)

1924
01:23:35,744 --> 01:24:05,572
 ?

1925
01:24:05,574 --> 01:24:23,290
 ?

1926
01:24:23,292 --> 01:24:24,691
 (whirring)

1927
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:43,777
天哪 看看你
Oh, God, look at you.

1928
01:24:44,379 --> 01:24:45,279
又是第一名 你的男伴看见你会摔到地上的
 Another first.

1929
01:24:45,281 --> 01:24:48,715
Your guy's going to fall through the floor when he comes in.

1930
01:24:48,717 --> 01:24:50,417
- 他不会的 - 肯定会的!
 No, he won't.

1931
01:24:50,419 --> 01:24:52,219
是真的不会 他不会来的
The hell he's not.

1932
01:24:52,221 --> 01:24:53,520
 No, he really won't.

1933
01:24:53,522 --> 01:24:54,721
- 什么 - 没事的
 He's not coming.

1934
01:24:54,723 --> 01:24:56,390
 What?

1935
01:24:56,392 --> 01:24:58,292
- 我要走了 - 一个人?
 It's okay.

1936
01:24:58,294 --> 01:24:59,860
 I'm gonna go.

1937
01:24:59,862 --> 01:25:00,861
是的 我不伤心
Alone?

1938
01:25:00,863 --> 01:25:02,463
 Yeah, I'm not sad about it.

1939
01:25:02,465 --> 01:25:03,664
我是说 我是有点受伤
 I'm not hurt.

1940
01:25:03,666 --> 01:25:05,732
 I mean, you know, I am hurt a little bit,

1941
01:25:05,734 --> 01:25:09,169
但我知道要是我不做 我会更难受
 but I know if I don't do it, I'll just feel a lot worse.

1942
01:25:09,171 --> 01:25:12,606
我要进去 走一圈 再走出来回家
 I'm just gonna go in, walk in, walk out,

1943
01:25:12,608 --> 01:25:14,608
你确定?
 and come home.

1944
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:15,776
 You sure?

1945
01:25:15,778 --> 01:25:16,376
我是想让他们知道我是打不倒的
 (sighs)

1946
01:25:16,378 --> 01:25:18,779
 I just want to let them know that they didn't break me.

1947
01:25:18,781 --> 01:25:23,484
 ("If You Leave" by Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark playing)

1948
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:43,237
 ? If you leave, don't leave now ?

1949
01:25:43,239 --> 01:25:47,241
 ? Please don't take my heart away ?

1950
01:25:47,243 --> 01:25:51,512
 ? Promise me just one more night ?

1951
01:25:51,514 --> 01:25:54,815
 ? And we'll go our separate ways ?

1952
01:25:54,817 --> 01:25:59,219
 ? We've always had time on our sides ?

1953
01:25:59,221 --> 01:26:02,456
 ? Now it's fading fast ?

1954
01:26:02,458 --> 01:26:04,158
张嘴
 Open up.

1955
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:07,294
 ? Every second, every moment

1956
01:26:07,296 --> 01:26:11,331
 ? We've got to, gotta make it last ?

1957
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:15,502
 ? I touch you once, I touch you twice ?

1958
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:17,371
? I won't let go at any price ?

1959
01:26:17,373 --> 01:26:18,338
要是有人想上楼动真格的 就告诉我
 STEFF: Well, as soon as

1960
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:21,308
 anybody's ready to go upstairs and get serious,

1961
01:26:21,310 --> 01:26:22,576
我们才来了一小时
 just let me know.

1962
01:26:22,578 --> 01:26:24,278
We've only been here an hour.

1963
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:24,912
我们可以上去再下来 好吗
 Well, we can go up

1964
01:26:24,914 --> 01:26:27,848
 and come back down again, Benny, all right?

1965
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:28,815
你看套间了吗?
Did you look at the suite?

1966
01:26:28,817 --> 01:26:31,385
一晚才300 本尼 肯定不是宫殿
 STEFF: It's 300 bucks a night, Benny.

1967
01:26:31,387 --> 01:26:33,654
 It's not gonna be a palace, okay?

1968
01:26:33,656 --> 01:26:35,522
我们应该再待一会儿 这些人以后就看不到了
I think we should stay for a while.

1969
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:37,624
We're not gonna see these people for much longer.

1970
01:26:37,626 --> 01:26:40,561
好了 坚持到最后好吗
 Come on, it's kind of the end, okay?

1971
01:26:40,563 --> 01:26:42,930
我才不管你做什么
 STEFF: I don't give a shit what you do.

1972
01:26:42,932 --> 01:26:47,534
 ? I'll be running the other way... ?

1973
01:27:16,998 --> 01:27:19,566
妈的
 Oh, damn.

1974
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:00,607
 My God.

1975
01:28:03,011 --> 01:28:04,611
- 你来了 怎么回事? - 就是这么回事
 You're here! What happened?!

1976
01:28:04,613 --> 01:28:07,414
Well, uh, guess you're looking at it.

1977
01:28:07,416 --> 01:28:08,315
你真好看
 Oh, wow, you look great.

1978
01:28:08,317 --> 01:28:11,551
谢谢 你太好看了 我呼吸不了了
 Thanks, you, uh, you look stunning.

1979
01:28:11,553 --> 01:28:15,022
Really, it's, it's, it's breathtaking.

1980
01:28:15,823 --> 01:28:17,357
听着 我想让你知道 除了我出现在这聚会以外
No, and listen, I want you to know,

1981
01:28:17,359 --> 01:28:21,728
despite my appearance at this function, I remain now,

1982
01:28:21,730 --> 01:28:25,499
我现在以及以后
and will always be, a Duck Man.

1983
01:28:23,089 --> 01:28:25,049
都会是唐老鸭

1984
01:28:28,936 --> 01:28:30,404
我崇拜你
 (giggles)

1985
01:28:30,406 --> 01:28:31,838
 May I admire you?

1986
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:35,676
要是你想的话
Oh, uh, if, if you wish.

1987
01:28:38,646 --> 01:28:40,814
我们过去吧
 Let's plow.

1988
01:28:40,948 --> 01:28:43,617
 ?

1989
01:28:43,619 --> 01:28:45,352
 ? Oh-oh-oh

1990
01:28:45,354 --> 01:28:47,854
 ? Oh-oh-oh

1991
01:28:47,856 --> 01:28:49,623
 ? Oh-oh-oh

1992
01:28:49,625 --> 01:28:51,625
 ? Oh-oh-oh

1993
01:28:51,627 --> 01:28:53,627
 ? Oh-oh-oh

1994
01:28:53,629 --> 01:28:55,962
 ? Oh-oh-oh

1995
01:28:55,964 --> 01:28:57,531
 ? Oh-oh-oh

1996
01:28:57,533 --> 01:28:58,799
 ? Oh-oh-oh

1997
01:28:58,801 --> 01:29:02,069
 ? I need you now like I needed you then ?

1998
01:29:02,071 --> 01:29:09,076
 ? You always said we'd still be friends someday ?

1999
01:29:11,012 --> 01:29:12,746
 ? If you leave, I won't cry ?

2000
01:29:12,748 --> 01:29:18,785
? I won't waste one single day ?

2001
01:29:18,787 --> 01:29:22,556
 ? But if you leave, don't look back ?

2002
01:29:22,558 --> 01:29:25,092
我们跳舞吧
 Should we dance?

2003
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:26,927
耳闻过
It wouldn't be unheard of.

2004
01:29:26,929 --> 01:29:30,664
 ? Seven years went under the bridge ?

2005
01:29:30,666 --> 01:29:31,832
是不是有点未解之谜 布兰?
? Like time standing still...

2006
01:29:31,834 --> 01:29:34,768
 A little, uh, lingering doubt perhaps, pal?

2007
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:36,703
你得给她名份 之后就甩了她
 You know, you gotta give her credit, though.

2008
01:29:36,705 --> 01:29:37,871
 I mean, after you dumped her,

2009
01:29:37,873 --> 01:29:40,073
她发现她这辈子最好的约会…
 she certainly went out and found herself what

2010
01:29:40,075 --> 01:29:42,542
 I'd have to say is probably the most

2011
01:29:42,544 --> 01:29:45,011
 interesting date that her generation...

2012
01:29:45,013 --> 01:29:47,714
什泰夫
Steff.

2013
01:29:48,449 --> 01:29:49,683
你能买到一切 却买不到她 这是你最受不了的
You buy everything, Steff.

2014
01:29:49,685 --> 01:29:50,717
You couldn't buy her, though.

2015
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:52,119
- 我不想听… - 什泰夫
That's what's killing you, isn't it?

2016
01:29:52,121 --> 01:29:54,554
Steff. I don't want to listen to this.

2017
01:29:54,556 --> 01:29:57,124
好了 什泰夫
 That's it, Steff.

2018
01:29:58,059 --> 01:30:00,594
她觉得你狗屎不如
She thinks you're shit.

2019
01:30:00,928 --> 01:30:03,997
你心里也知道她是对的
 And deep down, you know she's right.

2020
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:20,180
- 嗨 - 嗨
 Hi.

2021
01:30:21,149 --> 01:30:23,150
 Hi.

2022
01:30:34,629 --> 01:30:36,797
你不需要我的道歉
 You don't need me to say I'm sorry.

2023
01:30:36,799 --> 01:30:41,435
一切都过去了 我没事
 It's done. It's over with. I'm fine.

2024
01:30:41,437 --> 01:30:42,736
如果真是这样 我很欣慰
 ? You always said...

2025
01:30:42,738 --> 01:30:44,971
 Oh, well, if that's true, then I'm glad.

2026
01:30:44,973 --> 01:30:47,941
 ? ...we'd meet again ?

2027
01:30:47,943 --> 01:30:50,644
 ? Someday

2028
01:30:50,646 --> 01:30:53,980
不是这样的 但也没关系 是不是
 It's not true.

2029
01:30:53,982 --> 01:30:56,783
 It doesn't matter, does it?

2030
01:30:57,552 --> 01:30:59,119
你说过 你不能相信不相信你的人
You told me you couldn't believe in somebody

2031
01:30:59,121 --> 01:31:02,155
 who didn't believe in you; I believed in you.

2032
01:31:02,157 --> 01:31:05,625
我一直相信你
 Always believed in you.

2033
01:31:05,627 --> 01:31:08,061
我只是不相信自己
 Just didn't believe in me.

2034
01:31:13,067 --> 01:31:13,800
我爱你
 I love you.

2035
01:31:13,802 --> 01:31:17,871
 ? I need you now like I needed you then ?

2036
01:31:17,873 --> 01:31:21,741
 ? You always said we'd meet again ?

2037
01:31:21,743 --> 01:31:23,176
一直都是
 Always.

2038
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:33,487
安迪
 Andie.

2039
01:31:34,689 --> 01:31:36,923
他是一个人来的
 He came here alone.

2040
01:31:40,027 --> 01:31:42,028
是的 你说的对 他跟别人不一样
 Okay, you're right.

2041
01:31:42,030 --> 01:31:44,564
 He's not like the others.

2042
01:31:48,269 --> 01:31:49,836
要是你现在不去找他 我就再也不带你参加毕业舞会了
 If you don't go to him now,

2043
01:31:49,838 --> 01:31:50,770
 I'm never gonna take you

2044
01:31:50,772 --> 01:31:53,807
to another prom ever again, you hear me?

2045
01:31:53,809 --> 01:31:55,809
这是难得的浪漫时刻 却被你毁掉了
 I mean, this is an incredibly romantic moment

2046
01:31:55,811 --> 01:31:56,910
 and you're ruining it for me.

2047
01:31:56,912 --> 01:32:03,517
 ? I touch you twice, I won't let go at any price ?

2048
01:32:03,519 --> 01:32:05,151
谢谢 唐老鸭
 Thanks, Duckie.

2049
01:32:07,121 --> 01:32:07,854
去吧
 Go ahead.

2050
01:32:07,856 --> 01:32:14,928
 ? We'd meet again someday... ?

2051
01:32:44,058 --> 01:32:45,559
布兰!
 Blane?

2052
01:32:47,228 --> 01:32:48,962
 ? Oh-oh-oh

2053
01:32:48,964 --> 01:32:50,664
 ? Oh-oh-oh

2054
01:32:50,666 --> 01:32:52,966
 ? Oh-oh-oh

2055
01:32:52,968 --> 01:32:55,068
 ? Oh-oh-oh

2056
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:56,703
 ? Oh-oh-oh

2057
01:32:56,705 --> 01:32:58,772
 ? Oh-oh-oh

2058
01:32:58,774 --> 01:33:03,043
 ? Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

2059
01:33:03,045 --> 01:33:04,144
 ? If you leave

2060
01:33:04,146 --> 01:33:08,715
 ? Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

2061
01:33:08,717 --> 01:33:09,583
 ? Oh-oh-oh

2062
01:33:09,585 --> 01:33:12,719
 ? Oh, if you leave

2063
01:33:12,721 --> 01:33:16,823
 ? Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

2064
01:33:16,825 --> 01:33:22,062
 ? Oh, if you leave...

 ? Where nothing is ever put straight ?

2071
01:34:08,644 --> 01:34:12,646
 ? She turns herself round and she smiles and she says ?

2072
01:34:12,648 --> 01:34:16,783
 ? "This is it, that's the end of the joke" ?

2073
01:34:16,785 --> 01:34:20,053
 ? And loses herself in her dreaming and sleep ?

2074
01:34:20,055 --> 01:34:23,790
 ? And her lovers walk through in their cloaks ?

2075
01:34:23,792 --> 01:34:29,829
 ? She's... pretty in pink ?

2076
01:34:29,831 --> 01:34:37,370
 ? Isn't she... pretty in pink? ?

2077
01:34:37,372 --> 01:34:38,938
 ? Isn't she? ?

2078
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:41,908
 ? All of her lovers all talk of her notes ?

2079
01:34:41,910 --> 01:34:45,879
 ? And the flowers that they never sent ?

2080
01:34:45,881 --> 01:34:51,418
 ? And wasn't she easy? ?

2081
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:54,788
 ? Isn't she pretty in pink? ?

2082
01:34:54,790 --> 01:34:58,191
 ? The one who insists he was first in the line ?

2083
01:34:58,193 --> 01:35:01,795
 ? Is the last to remember her name ?

2084
01:35:01,797 --> 01:35:05,198
 ? He's walking around in this dress that she wore ?

2085
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:09,803
 ? She is gone, but the joke's the same ?

2086
01:35:09,805 --> 01:35:14,007
 ? Pretty in pink

2087
01:35:14,009 --> 01:35:17,711
 ? Isn't she... ?

2088
01:35:17,713 --> 01:35:20,346
 ? Pretty in pink?

2089
01:35:20,348 --> 01:35:24,084
 ? Isn't she? ?

2090
01:35:37,064 --> 01:35:39,933
 ? All the favorite rags are worn ?

2091
01:35:39,935 --> 01:35:41,434
 ? And other kinds of uniform

2092
01:35:41,436 --> 01:35:46,940
 ? But kid, you're already free like individuality ?

2093
01:35:46,942 --> 01:35:53,947
 ? You are what she wants to be until tomorrow. ?
