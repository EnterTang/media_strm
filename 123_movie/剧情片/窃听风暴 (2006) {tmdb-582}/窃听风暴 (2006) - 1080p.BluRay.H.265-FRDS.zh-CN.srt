1
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,691
Stand still. Eyes to the floor.

2
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:47,814
Walk on.

3
00:00:48,023 --> 00:00:52,689
TEMPORARY DETENTION CENTER
MINISTRY FOR STATE SECURITY

4
00:00:52,856 --> 00:00:54,731
Address him as 'Captain!'

5
00:00:57,148 --> 00:00:58,690
Enter.

6
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:02,147
Sit down.

7
00:01:05,272 --> 00:01:08,022
Hands under your thighs, palms down.

8
00:01:14,146 --> 00:01:16,020
What do you have to tell us?

9
00:01:16,853 --> 00:01:18,811
I've done nothing.

10
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,561
I know nothing.

11
00:01:22,103 --> 00:01:24,603
You've done nothing, know nothing...

12
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:29,809
You think we imprison people on a whim?

13
00:01:29,934 --> 00:01:31,768
No...

14
00:01:32,018 --> 00:01:34,351
If you think our humanistic system
capable of such a thing,

15
00:01:34,476 --> 00:01:37,644
that alone would justify your arrest.

16
00:01:40,018 --> 00:01:44,059
We'd like to jog your memory, prisoner no. 227.

17
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:46,726
On September 28th, Dieter Pirmasens,

18
00:01:46,727 --> 00:01:50,434
your friend and neighbor, fled to the West.

19
00:01:50,768 --> 00:01:53,350
We believe that he had help.

20
00:01:53,517 --> 00:01:54,933
I know nothing.

21
00:01:55,642 --> 00:01:58,057
He didn't even tell me he wanted to leave.

22
00:01:58,182 --> 00:02:00,099
I first heard about it at work.

23
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,806
Please recount what you did on September 28th.

24
00:02:05,348 --> 00:02:09,098
- It's in my statement.
- Tell me again.

25
00:02:10,181 --> 00:02:13,597
I was at Treptow Park memorial with my children.

26
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:16,598
Where I met my old friend Max Kirchner.

27
00:02:16,764 --> 00:02:20,638
We went to his place
and listened to music until late.

28
00:02:21,388 --> 00:02:24,597
He has a telephone,
you can call him to confirm this.

29
00:02:25,013 --> 00:02:27,012
I can give you the number.

30
00:02:28,554 --> 00:02:30,928
The enemies of our state are arrogant.

31
00:02:31,178 --> 00:02:32,928
Remember that.

32
00:02:33,011 --> 00:02:36,720
It takes patience. About 40 hours worth.
(STASI COLLEGE, POTSDAM-EICHE)

33
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:39,303
Fast forward...

34
00:02:41,052 --> 00:02:42,801
I want to sleep.

35
00:02:44,718 --> 00:02:47,259
Please, let me sleep!

36
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:49,843
Hands under your thighs.

37
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:55,093
Tell me again
what you did on September 28th.

38
00:02:57,842 --> 00:03:03,383
Please, just one hour,
just a little... a little sleep.

39
00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:06,633
Tell me again what you did on that day.

40
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,840
Why keep him awake for so long?

41
00:03:14,923 --> 00:03:17,840
It's... inhuman.

42
00:03:23,796 --> 00:03:28,004
An innocent prisoner
will become more angry by the hour,

43
00:03:28,254 --> 00:03:30,130
due to the injustice suffered.

44
00:03:30,339 --> 00:03:32,880
He will shout and rage.

45
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:37,670
A guilty prisoner
becomes more calm and quiet...

46
00:03:37,795 --> 00:03:39,545
Or he cries.

47
00:03:39,712 --> 00:03:42,087
He knows he's there for a reason.

48
00:03:42,212 --> 00:03:45,463
The best way to establish guilt or innocence

49
00:03:45,546 --> 00:03:48,337
is non-stop interrogation.

50
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:50,919
...school friend Max Kirchner.

51
00:03:52,044 --> 00:03:54,336
We went to his place...

52
00:03:56,044 --> 00:03:59,669
and listened to music until late.

53
00:04:01,585 --> 00:04:06,668
He has a telephone,
you can call him to confirm this.

54
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,710
Do you notice anything about his statement?

55
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,792
It's the same as at the beginning.

56
00:04:15,292 --> 00:04:18,875
Exactly the same. Word for word.

57
00:04:19,249 --> 00:04:22,249
People who tell the truth
can re-formulate things,

58
00:04:22,374 --> 00:04:23,416
and they do.

59
00:04:24,374 --> 00:04:27,456
A liar has prepared sentences,
which he falls back on

60
00:04:27,457 --> 00:04:29,998
when under pressure.

61
00:04:30,832 --> 00:04:33,372
227 is lying.

62
00:04:33,497 --> 00:04:38,539
We have two important indicators,
and can increase the intensity.

63
00:04:39,163 --> 00:04:41,913
If you don't give names,

64
00:04:41,955 --> 00:04:44,164
We'll have to arrest your wife.

65
00:04:46,081 --> 00:04:49,121
Jan and Nadja
will be put into state care.

66
00:04:49,371 --> 00:04:50,913
Is that what you want?

67
00:04:56,787 --> 00:04:59,204
Who was the person who helped him flee?

68
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,036
- Glaske...
- Again! Speak clearly!

69
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,327
Glaske... Werner Glaske.

70
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,493
Werner... Glaske.

71
00:05:14,618 --> 00:05:16,659
Quiet!

72
00:05:17,991 --> 00:05:19,283
Quiet!

73
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,075
Listen!

74
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,951
Does anyone know what that is?

75
00:05:34,615 --> 00:05:37,532
It's the odor sample for the dogs.

76
00:05:37,657 --> 00:05:42,490
It must be collected at every
interrogation. Never forget it!

77
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:51,281
Your subjects are enemies of Socialism.

78
00:05:51,822 --> 00:05:55,156
Never forget that! Goodbye.

79
00:06:00,071 --> 00:06:02,030
That was good, really good.

80
00:06:05,613 --> 00:06:06,696
You remember

81
00:06:06,988 --> 00:06:11,154
how we sat there 20 years ago?

82
00:06:13,694 --> 00:06:16,194
They've offered me a professorship.

83
00:06:18,486 --> 00:06:23,318
Life's not about good grades, though
mine weren't that bad, thanks to you.

84
00:06:23,943 --> 00:06:25,277
So what's up?

85
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:28,401
Why do you always think I'm scheming?

86
00:06:28,734 --> 00:06:31,776
- I wanted to invite you to the theater.
- The theater?

87
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:35,525
I heard that Minister Hempf is going.

88
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,567
As head of the Culture Department,
I should show my face.

89
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:43,525
It starts at 7 p.m. We should get going.

90
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:49,565
THE LIVES OF OTHERS

91
00:06:56,773 --> 00:06:59,898
Minister Hempf at one o'clock.

92
00:07:00,731 --> 00:07:04,855
He used to be in State Security, you know.

93
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:08,022
He really cleaned up the theater scene.

94
00:07:15,604 --> 00:07:18,354
Georg Dreyman, the writer.

95
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:23,270
An arrogant type, the kind I warn my students about.

96
00:07:23,395 --> 00:07:24,936
But he's loyal.

97
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,435
If they were all like him, I'd be out of a job.

98
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:32,602
He's our only non-subversive writer
who is also read in the West.

99
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,602
He thinks the GDR is the greatest country on earth.

100
00:07:40,017 --> 00:07:41,642
It starts.

101
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:58,058
What's wrong, my child? A new vision?

102
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,850
Speak, Marta! Speak!

103
00:08:00,142 --> 00:08:01,183
Your Arthur...

104
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:04,642
is dead.

105
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:09,098
Arthur? Can't you be wrong, just this once?

106
00:08:09,265 --> 00:08:11,181
No, sister. Believe me.

107
00:08:13,348 --> 00:08:15,890
He fell to his death.

108
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:22,013
Crushed by the mighty wheel.

109
00:08:23,013 --> 00:08:25,138
I see it,

110
00:08:26,846 --> 00:08:28,846
though I'd rather see any other horror.

111
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:35,178
Why am I not spared these visions?

112
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:41,762
Elena! Go home... and mourn.
I'll finish your shift.

113
00:09:23,672 --> 00:09:27,755
Did you like it? Dreyman's good, eh?

114
00:09:27,922 --> 00:09:29,713
I'd have him monitored.

115
00:09:29,838 --> 00:09:34,004
Monitored? All that teaching
is ruining your instincts.

116
00:09:34,088 --> 00:09:36,295
I could oversee it myself.

117
00:09:36,337 --> 00:09:39,295
He's clean, I tell you. Even Hempf likes him.

118
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,003
We'd be shooting ourselves in the foot.

119
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,337
I'm going down.

120
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,836
"Faces of Love"

121
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,874
I hear a lot about your work.

122
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,083
They say culture's in good hands.

123
00:10:20,124 --> 00:10:21,959
Your name is mentioned in Party circles.

124
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:24,500
We're the Party's 'shield and sword'.

125
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,666
I'm aware of that at all times.

126
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:33,498
What do you make of him?

127
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,915
Of Georg Dreyman?

128
00:10:42,413 --> 00:10:44,205
Maybe...

129
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,663
Maybe what?

130
00:10:49,705 --> 00:10:53,829
Maybe he's not as clean as he seems.

131
00:10:55,536 --> 00:10:59,662
Grubitz! That's why you and I are on top.

132
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:02,579
Your average Stasi chump would have said,

133
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,787
"One of our best! So loyal!" etc.

134
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:07,911
But we can see more.

135
00:11:08,743 --> 00:11:10,785
You're heading to the very top, Grubitz.

136
00:11:13,785 --> 00:11:15,410
There's something fishy about him.

137
00:11:15,577 --> 00:11:18,743
I can feel it in my gut.

138
00:11:22,991 --> 00:11:25,366
Dreyman's having a party next week.

139
00:11:25,408 --> 00:11:28,616
Some dubious types are going, Hauser and that rabble.

140
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,658
Try to wire the place discreetly by then.

141
00:11:30,783 --> 00:11:34,032
Measures A and B.

142
00:11:34,407 --> 00:11:36,407
Only in his rooms. Nothing conspicuous.

143
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,949
He has powerful friends.

144
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,782
No one is to know about this

145
00:11:40,865 --> 00:11:44,074
until we've found something.

146
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:50,031
But if you get something on him,

147
00:11:50,114 --> 00:11:52,988
you'll have a good friend in the Central Committee.

148
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:54,989
You understand what I'm saying?

149
00:11:57,989 --> 00:12:00,738
Have a nice evening, Comrade Minister.

150
00:12:21,986 --> 00:12:24,111
Why is he staring at us?

151
00:12:28,152 --> 00:12:30,318
What's he doing here, anyway?

152
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,442
I think he's got a crush on you.

153
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:54,565
I can't let the evening pass
without raising a toast to our artists.

154
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:58,774
A great Socialist,
I can't recall who it was, once said:

155
00:12:58,857 --> 00:13:02,689
Writers are engineers of the soul.

156
00:13:02,814 --> 00:13:04,188
So Georg Dreyman is

157
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,772
one of our country's greatest engineers.

158
00:13:10,313 --> 00:13:14,022
- What charming bed-fellows you have.
- Paul!

159
00:13:15,812 --> 00:13:17,852
And to Christa-Maria Sieland,

160
00:13:17,853 --> 00:13:20,728
the loveliest pearl of the GDR.

161
00:13:20,811 --> 00:13:23,061
I believe that
nobody contradict my opinion.

162
00:13:23,228 --> 00:13:25,770
Let's raise our glasses

163
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:29,935
to Christa-Maria Sieland:
Three cheers to her.

164
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,602
Someone like him doesn't even deserve
to address you.

165
00:13:36,727 --> 00:13:39,227
Stay with me!

166
00:13:41,352 --> 00:13:43,184
And now something for the soul...

167
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:46,683
May I?

168
00:13:51,933 --> 00:13:55,599
- How did you like my speech?
- Many thanks.

169
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,141
I liked your play too.

170
00:13:58,724 --> 00:13:59,807
Really, it was good.

171
00:14:00,182 --> 00:14:03,807
"Engineers of the soul."
That was a Stalin quote.

172
00:14:03,891 --> 00:14:05,099
Really?

173
00:14:06,391 --> 00:14:09,557
I, too, like to provoke, Mr. Hauser.

174
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:13,306
But unlike you, I know how far I can go.

175
00:14:14,431 --> 00:14:17,306
I'm more like our dear Dreyman.

176
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,640
He knows that the Party needs artists,

177
00:14:19,765 --> 00:14:21,680
but that artists need the Party even more.

178
00:14:22,264 --> 00:14:25,180
If you're going to talk politics,
I'll find another dance partner.

179
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:28,096
- I'm willing.
- Too late!

180
00:14:32,888 --> 00:14:36,220
I follow our theater with interest.

181
00:14:36,262 --> 00:14:38,303
It used to be theater people...

182
00:14:38,387 --> 00:14:40,345
- Paul!
- It's okay,

183
00:14:40,387 --> 00:14:42,302
I've known Mr. Hauser for years.

184
00:14:42,427 --> 00:14:43,552
Comrade Schwalber!

185
00:14:44,177 --> 00:14:46,677
You did a good job tonight too.

186
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,802
Dreyman, I'm glad you're working
with such directors.

187
00:14:50,844 --> 00:14:52,719
It wasn't always so.

188
00:14:54,511 --> 00:14:56,260
You're referring to Jerska?

189
00:14:58,635 --> 00:15:01,550
I think you judged him too harshly.

190
00:15:02,675 --> 00:15:06,425
Sure, he went too far in what he said.
Without a doubt.

191
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:08,384
But

192
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:13,548
put yourself in his shoes for a moment.
You, as a man of honor.

193
00:15:14,423 --> 00:15:17,507
He can't remove his name
from that statement.

194
00:15:20,007 --> 00:15:24,007
He could work for any theater in the West.

195
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,839
But he wants to stay here.

196
00:15:25,922 --> 00:15:30,172
Because he believes in Socialism
and in this country.

197
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:33,964
- His black-listing is...
- Black-listing?

198
00:15:34,506 --> 00:15:40,170
We don't do that here!
You should choose your words more carefully.

199
00:15:45,504 --> 00:15:48,212
Comrade Hempf, just between us:

200
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,627
My plays are not strong enough

201
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,252
to survive Schwalber's direction.

202
00:15:53,335 --> 00:15:55,085
I need Jerska,

203
00:15:56,043 --> 00:15:58,127
and I think you judged him too harshly.

204
00:15:58,168 --> 00:15:59,920
Well, I don't.

205
00:16:00,003 --> 00:16:02,420
But that's what we all love about your plays.

206
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,669
Your love for mankind...

207
00:16:04,794 --> 00:16:06,585
your belief that people can change.

208
00:16:07,668 --> 00:16:08,543
Dreyman,

209
00:16:09,918 --> 00:16:12,710
no matter how often you say it in your plays,

210
00:16:13,626 --> 00:16:15,585
people do not change!

211
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,833
How is he, by the way?

212
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,291
He hopes that his black- ...

213
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,166
that he can work again soon.

214
00:16:33,789 --> 00:16:35,497
Is he right in hoping?

215
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:39,748
Of course he is.
As long as he lives, and even longer.

216
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:43,622
Because as you know, Dreyman,
hope always dies last.

217
00:16:58,787 --> 00:17:01,787
The team will be ready
to wire the place as of tomorrow.

218
00:17:02,911 --> 00:17:05,328
It needs to be finished by Thursday.

219
00:17:05,453 --> 00:17:06,786
You should plan everything carefully.

220
00:17:06,911 --> 00:17:08,036
Think you can do it?

221
00:17:12,035 --> 00:17:13,035
Good night.

222
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:48,775
I'll get in trouble if I don't go.

223
00:18:48,817 --> 00:18:50,358
- With who?
- My girlfriend.

224
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:50,093
Twenty minutes.

225
00:22:47,538 --> 00:22:48,163
Yes?

226
00:22:48,288 --> 00:22:51,413
Frau Meineke... One word of this to anyone,

227
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:54,539
and Masha loses her spot at the university.

228
00:22:58,037 --> 00:22:59,954
Is that understood?

229
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:01,954
Yes.

230
00:23:04,954 --> 00:23:08,829
Send Mrs. Meineke a gift for her cooperation.

231
00:23:20,993 --> 00:23:22,993
It must be Thursday again.

232
00:23:23,908 --> 00:23:27,866
Time passes so quickly...
Perhaps that's a good thing.

233
00:23:46,074 --> 00:23:48,699
- How are you?
- Not bad.

234
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:52,363
It's not always this noisy.

235
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,738
Only on Thursdays, I know.

236
00:23:55,988 --> 00:23:57,363
Yes.

237
00:24:01,405 --> 00:24:03,029
We missed you at the premiere.

238
00:24:03,821 --> 00:24:05,778
Did Schwalber do a good job?

239
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,572
His good bits were stolen from you.

240
00:24:11,072 --> 00:24:13,072
That keeps my ideas alive.

241
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:22,778
Don't bear it.

242
00:24:22,903 --> 00:24:25,278
I can't bear those fat, dressed-up people

243
00:24:25,361 --> 00:24:27,320
at premieres anymore.

244
00:24:30,152 --> 00:24:33,444
Doesn't sound like me, does it?

245
00:24:34,026 --> 00:24:36,859
But maybe this is the real me,

246
00:24:36,901 --> 00:24:39,026
not the old Jerska.

247
00:24:39,234 --> 00:24:43,067
He was friendly and caring, nourished by success...

248
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:48,317
all thanks to the grace of the bigwigs.

249
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,649
But I won't complain much longer.

250
00:24:55,482 --> 00:24:59,191
In my next life, I'll simply be an author.

251
00:24:59,232 --> 00:25:03,148
A happy author
who can write whenever he wants.

252
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,731
Like you.

253
00:25:07,355 --> 00:25:10,439
What is a director if he can't direct?

254
00:25:11,272 --> 00:25:14,647
He's a projectionist without a film,

255
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,563
a miller without corn. He is nothing.

256
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,896
Nothing at all.

257
00:25:27,271 --> 00:25:32,478
Albert, the Minister was at the premiere.
Minister Hempf.

258
00:25:33,977 --> 00:25:36,936
I spoke to him about your blacklisting.

259
00:25:41,394 --> 00:25:43,227
It looks promising.

260
00:25:43,644 --> 00:25:48,934
He gave me hope, concrete hope. Literally.

261
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:51,892
Really?

262
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,850
That's great.

263
00:26:41,053 --> 00:26:44,095
Cheap Georgian wine. Chateau Jerska.

264
00:26:44,178 --> 00:26:47,053
So is our holy drinker coming?

265
00:26:50,219 --> 00:26:52,469
I forgot to ask him.

266
00:26:58,635 --> 00:27:02,135
You're strong and forceful.
That's how I need you.

267
00:27:02,635 --> 00:27:04,967
Don't let this blackness into your life.

268
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:08,217
- Albert is my friend.
- And you're my boyfriend.

269
00:27:08,384 --> 00:27:10,508
Looks like a 50th.

270
00:27:11,091 --> 00:27:13,341
But I'm going to be 40, right?

271
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:17,924
Don't forget, you promised
to wear a tie for your birthday.

272
00:27:18,424 --> 00:27:20,591
I would, but I don't have one.

273
00:27:24,923 --> 00:27:26,465
Bon anniversaire!

274
00:27:29,964 --> 00:27:31,506
Atie?

275
00:27:31,631 --> 00:27:33,339
You said you didn't want any books.

276
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:38,130
Or can't you tie a tie,

277
00:27:38,171 --> 00:27:39,380
you old working-class poet?

278
00:27:39,796 --> 00:27:40,880
What?

279
00:27:42,379 --> 00:27:44,254
I was born wearing a tie!

280
00:27:45,087 --> 00:27:46,629
I had to "fight my way out

281
00:27:46,712 --> 00:27:49,379
of my middle-class fetters".

282
00:27:49,754 --> 00:27:53,462
Then put those fetters on again, just for me.

283
00:28:01,753 --> 00:28:04,419
Alright... It's no

284
00:28:05,461 --> 00:28:07,502
big deal to tie a tie.

285
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:26,875
Frau Meineke, would you come in for a moment!

286
00:28:34,207 --> 00:28:37,249
Can you tie a tie?

287
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:44,332
You've no idea how thankful I am.

288
00:28:49,872 --> 00:28:54,913
- Are you feeling unwell?
- No... I'm feeling fine.

289
00:28:55,497 --> 00:28:56,705
Finished?

290
00:29:01,204 --> 00:29:05,245
Wonderful. It's perfect.
It couldn't be better.

291
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:10,287
It'll be our secret.
You can keep a secret, right?

292
00:29:10,829 --> 00:29:12,204
Of course.

293
00:29:22,702 --> 00:29:26,534
I'll be damned! And I thought you couldn't do it.

294
00:29:26,909 --> 00:29:29,534
You don't normally hide your talents.

295
00:29:29,743 --> 00:29:32,408
You've no idea of the things I can do!

296
00:29:37,283 --> 00:29:38,824
The first guest.

297
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,366
Our dear neighbors locked the main door again.

298
00:29:47,449 --> 00:29:49,407
- Can you go?
- Yes, I'm going.

299
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:18,986
Maestro! Our humble offerings.

300
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:22,903
- I expressly said no books!
- But thanks.

301
00:30:25,612 --> 00:30:26,737
Would you like a drink?

302
00:30:26,821 --> 00:30:28,820
- A soda.
- Vodka for me.

303
00:30:28,903 --> 00:30:29,736
I'll get it.

304
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,608
Why the hell's Albert sitting all alone?

305
00:30:43,817 --> 00:30:46,942
He won't talk to us.
He sent us all away.

306
00:31:01,316 --> 00:31:03,024
I brought you something too.

307
00:31:07,107 --> 00:31:12,022
- Did you really come here to read?
- It is Brecht!

308
00:31:20,689 --> 00:31:23,770
I feel like a fraud among these people.

309
00:31:24,228 --> 00:31:25,770
A fraud?

310
00:31:26,062 --> 00:31:29,937
Come off it, Albert!
You're losing your grip on reality.

311
00:31:31,395 --> 00:31:33,687
You know how we admire you,

312
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,561
how everybody admires you.

313
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:38,686
For something I did 10 years ago...

314
00:31:41,061 --> 00:31:44,061
and could probably never do again.

315
00:31:47,976 --> 00:31:50,685
My favorite director! Wait!

316
00:31:50,726 --> 00:31:52,267
I need to talk to you a moment.

317
00:31:52,434 --> 00:31:54,392
Tell me again how you got into this position.

318
00:31:54,434 --> 00:31:57,017
Pure talent.

319
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:00,891
Of course!

320
00:32:01,433 --> 00:32:04,016
But what else did you have to do?

321
00:32:04,849 --> 00:32:07,390
Everyone knows you're with the Stasi!

322
00:32:07,473 --> 00:32:09,932
- What an outrageous insinuation!
- Don't forget it!

323
00:32:09,933 --> 00:32:11,765
- Paul!
- What?

324
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:15,347
Excuse my friend, he's had too much to drink.

325
00:32:18,349 --> 00:32:21,432
But you know he's with the Stasi!

326
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:24,140
No, Paul. I don't know that.

327
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,887
You're such an idealist
that you're almost a bigwig.

328
00:32:47,054 --> 00:32:50,094
It was informers and conformists
like that who ruined Albert.

329
00:32:50,178 --> 00:32:52,260
Spy, betrayer!

330
00:32:52,552 --> 00:32:56,011
If you don't take a stand, you're not human!

331
00:32:56,178 --> 00:32:59,344
If you ever want to take action, call.

332
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:02,261
If not, we don't have to meet again.

333
00:33:31,381 --> 00:33:34,006
Your friends don't have much taste.

334
00:33:34,547 --> 00:33:36,131
That's really unfair.

335
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:40,339
Here! Look at this beautiful backscratcher.

336
00:33:40,672 --> 00:33:43,047
That's a salad fork!

337
00:33:43,838 --> 00:33:46,545
Still, it's beautiful... And look at this.

338
00:33:48,129 --> 00:33:51,920
I'll write my new play with this.

339
00:33:53,045 --> 00:33:55,087
You have no taste either!

340
00:33:56,379 --> 00:33:58,419
I do in some things.

341
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:18,417
- It's from Jerska.
- So he did give you a book!

342
00:34:22,085 --> 00:34:25,417
"Sonata for a Good Man"

343
00:34:49,164 --> 00:34:53,331
"'Lazlo' and CMS unwrap presents,

344
00:34:53,456 --> 00:34:57,247
then presumably have intercourse."

345
00:35:00,538 --> 00:35:02,412
You're late.

346
00:35:02,912 --> 00:35:04,704
Sorry, Captain.

347
00:35:04,787 --> 00:35:07,829
Those red lights made me
lose all of four minutes.

348
00:35:08,329 --> 00:35:10,036
You know how it is.

349
00:35:18,744 --> 00:35:25,244
They're already at it! Unbelievable! These artists!

350
00:35:25,744 --> 00:35:27,326
They're always at it!

351
00:35:27,409 --> 00:35:30,618
That's why I prefer monitoring artists
to priests or peace activists.

352
00:35:33,909 --> 00:35:35,909
See you tomorrow at 11 a.m.

353
00:35:43,616 --> 00:35:47,741
Albert Jerska, operation 'Engerling'.
Systematic as usual, Wiesler.

354
00:35:47,824 --> 00:35:50,699
The files will be sent. Let's have lunch.

355
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:06,072
The BSG Volleyball team will meet at 7 p.m.

356
00:36:07,238 --> 00:36:09,446
Did you forget? Bosses sit over there.

357
00:36:10,154 --> 00:36:13,196
Socialism must start somewhere.

358
00:36:18,945 --> 00:36:20,819
About the license plate of the car

359
00:36:20,902 --> 00:36:24,653
that brought Ms. Sieland home...

360
00:36:26,445 --> 00:36:29,362
It's Minister Hempf's car.

361
00:36:32,361 --> 00:36:33,402
Wiesler,

362
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:38,611
we can't monitor top officials.
I removed the entry in your report.

363
00:36:38,777 --> 00:36:41,736
Nothing written from now on,

364
00:36:41,777 --> 00:36:43,986
just oral!

365
00:36:45,943 --> 00:36:50,484
So we're helping a Committee member
get a rival out of the way.

366
00:36:52,442 --> 00:36:54,484
You know what this could mean

367
00:36:54,567 --> 00:36:58,191
for my career. And for yours.

368
00:36:59,274 --> 00:37:01,857
If we find something...

369
00:37:06,856 --> 00:37:08,648
Is that why we joined?

370
00:37:09,981 --> 00:37:11,897
You remember the oath we took?

371
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:14,480
"We are the Party's shield and sword."

372
00:37:14,564 --> 00:37:17,022
What is the Party, if not its members?

373
00:37:17,522 --> 00:37:20,564
And if those members
are highly influential, all the better!

374
00:37:21,564 --> 00:37:23,147
I've got a new one.

375
00:37:23,854 --> 00:37:27,354
Honecker comes into his office,

376
00:37:27,604 --> 00:37:30,479
opens the window, sees the sun, and says...

377
00:37:31,853 --> 00:37:33,645
What's wrong?

378
00:37:37,686 --> 00:37:40,977
Oh, excuse me... I just...

379
00:37:41,061 --> 00:37:43,186
No, carry on, colleague!

380
00:37:43,602 --> 00:37:47,810
No harm in laughing about
the Party Chairman, is there.

381
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:50,309
I probably know the joke anyway.

382
00:37:53,601 --> 00:37:55,018
Come on, tell us!

383
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:01,934
Well... Honecker...

384
00:38:02,808 --> 00:38:04,766
I mean, the Comrade General Secretary
sees the sun and says,

385
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:07,849
- "Good morning, dear sun!"
- More like, "Good morning, dear sun!"

386
00:38:12,516 --> 00:38:16,597
The sun replies, "Good morning, dear Erich!"

387
00:38:16,681 --> 00:38:20,139
And at noon, Erich goes to the window and says,

388
00:38:20,222 --> 00:38:21,764
"Good day, dear sun!"

389
00:38:21,806 --> 00:38:24,181
The sun replies, "Good day, dear Erich!"

390
00:38:24,222 --> 00:38:27,639
In the evening, Erich says again,

391
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:28,971
"Good evening, dear sun!"

392
00:38:29,055 --> 00:38:30,721
and the sun doesn't reply.

393
00:38:31,347 --> 00:38:32,264
"Good evening, dear sun..."

394
00:38:32,347 --> 00:38:35,264
"What's wrong?" he asks.

395
00:38:35,389 --> 00:38:36,556
And the sun replies,

396
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:38,847
"Screw you, I'm in the West now!"

397
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:46,720
Name?

398
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,095
Rank? Department?

399
00:38:50,804 --> 00:38:52,220
Me?

400
00:38:54,428 --> 00:38:55,927
Stigler.

401
00:38:56,468 --> 00:38:59,593
2nd Lieutenant Axel Stigler. Dept. M.

402
00:39:00,052 --> 00:39:02,302
I don't have to tell you

403
00:39:02,385 --> 00:39:04,635
what this means for your career.

404
00:39:06,967 --> 00:39:11,551
Please, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel,
I was just...

405
00:39:11,676 --> 00:39:15,759
You were just deriding the Party!
That's incitement,

406
00:39:16,176 --> 00:39:18,259
and likely just the tip of the iceberg!

407
00:39:19,009 --> 00:39:21,758
I will report this to the Minister's office.

408
00:39:33,631 --> 00:39:36,756
Just kidding! Good one, huh?

409
00:39:37,048 --> 00:39:40,547
But yours was good too.
I know a better one though.

410
00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:44,297
What's the difference between Honecker and a phone?

411
00:39:45,255 --> 00:39:46,422
None at all.

412
00:39:46,588 --> 00:39:48,922
Hang up, try again!

413
00:40:31,792 --> 00:40:34,875
- No, I have to get home.
- Bye.

414
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:44,040
Cold?

415
00:40:47,249 --> 00:40:50,830
Christa, you forgot our meeting on Thursday.

416
00:40:51,997 --> 00:40:54,997
Or did your poet have two birthdays in a row?

417
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:58,788
Come on, get in.

418
00:41:00,038 --> 00:41:00,872
Get in!

419
00:41:13,662 --> 00:41:15,954
You don't know what's good for you.

420
00:41:30,951 --> 00:41:32,367
Don't worry.

421
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:36,158
I'm looking after you.

422
00:41:51,032 --> 00:41:53,449
Tell me you don't need it too.

423
00:41:54,532 --> 00:41:56,573
Just say so, and I'll let you go.

424
00:42:07,696 --> 00:42:09,321
I'm meeting someone.

425
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,945
Where do you think we're going?

426
00:42:15,903 --> 00:42:20,820
I'm taking you to him!
You'll be there even quicker.

427
00:43:16,189 --> 00:43:18,189
Time for some bitter truths.

428
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:36,063
Yes?

429
00:43:45,936 --> 00:43:47,394
Those idiots!

430
00:44:10,099 --> 00:44:12,766
Next Thursday at the Metropol.

431
00:44:14,433 --> 00:44:15,558
Drive!

432
00:46:35,583 --> 00:46:36,833
Christa?

433
00:46:38,958 --> 00:46:40,833
Just hold me.

434
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:13,537
Good evening, comrade!

435
00:47:15,412 --> 00:47:18,120
You're 5 minutes late again.

436
00:48:01,656 --> 00:48:04,698
Evening. 11th floor, right corridor.

437
00:48:04,906 --> 00:48:07,030
I'm already up here.

438
00:48:11,654 --> 00:48:14,154
How did you get into the building?

439
00:48:14,571 --> 00:48:16,904
A bunch of you guys live here.

440
00:48:18,946 --> 00:48:21,153
I don't think I've been here before.

441
00:48:21,695 --> 00:48:23,277
No, I don't think you have.

442
00:48:36,651 --> 00:48:39,569
Well? Was that nice?

443
00:48:48,069 --> 00:48:51,359
- Stay awhile.
- I can't,

444
00:48:51,859 --> 00:48:53,900
my next customer is at half-past.

445
00:48:55,859 --> 00:48:57,734
I work on a schedule.

446
00:49:04,023 --> 00:49:07,648
At one-thirty?
You won't make it.

447
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:11,316
Sure I will. Don't you worry.

448
00:49:13,108 --> 00:49:15,440
Book me for longer next time.

449
00:49:16,523 --> 00:49:17,148
Bye.

450
00:50:23,556 --> 00:50:27,474
Georg? Did you hear about Hauser?

451
00:50:28,389 --> 00:50:29,514
No, what happened?

452
00:50:29,806 --> 00:50:31,805
He can't get a travel permit

453
00:50:31,847 --> 00:50:33,388
for his lectures in the West.

454
00:50:35,888 --> 00:50:37,347
Are you surprised?

455
00:50:38,013 --> 00:50:40,889
If he acts so arrogantly,
he should expect it.

456
00:50:42,513 --> 00:50:45,429
Would you let him go,
if you were in their position?

457
00:50:50,012 --> 00:51:00,260
"CMS comes home. 'Lazlo' approves of
Hauser's foreign travel ban."

458
00:51:07,303 --> 00:51:09,678
Have you seen my Brecht book?

459
00:51:09,761 --> 00:51:11,426
- What?
- My Brecht book.

460
00:51:13,134 --> 00:51:14,301
I don't know where it is.

461
00:51:16,301 --> 00:51:18,842
Strange. I could've sworn...

462
00:51:19,926 --> 00:51:25,257
One day in blue-moon September,
silent under a plum tree,

463
00:51:25,674 --> 00:51:29,007
I held her, my silent pale love,
in my arms like a fair

464
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:31,549
and lovely dream.

465
00:51:32,382 --> 00:51:34,757
Above us in the summer skies

466
00:51:34,882 --> 00:51:37,423
was a cloud that caught my eye.

467
00:51:37,756 --> 00:51:41,506
It was white and so high up.

468
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:45,173
And when I looked up,
it was no longer there.

469
00:52:05,836 --> 00:52:08,377
- Yes?
- Georg? Wallner here.

470
00:52:08,794 --> 00:52:09,669
What's up?

471
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:13,210
Georg, it's about Jerska.

472
00:52:14,002 --> 00:52:16,793
He hanged himself last night.

473
00:52:24,584 --> 00:52:26,043
Georg?

474
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:30,250
I'm going to hang up, okay?

475
00:53:01,456 --> 00:53:04,289
"Sonata for a Good Man"

476
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:22,571
You know what Lenin said
about Beethoven's 'Appassionata'.

477
00:54:25,154 --> 00:54:26,487
"If I keep listening to it,

478
00:54:26,528 --> 00:54:29,027
I won't finish the revolution."

479
00:54:33,569 --> 00:54:36,361
Can anyone who has heard this music,

480
00:54:37,276 --> 00:54:38,776
I mean truly heard it,

481
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,567
really be a bad person?

482
00:55:16,189 --> 00:55:18,231
Are you really with the Stasi?

483
00:55:23,897 --> 00:55:26,939
Do you even know what the Stasi is?

484
00:55:27,022 --> 00:55:32,563
Yes. They're bad men
who put people in prison, says my dad.

485
00:55:33,688 --> 00:55:34,688
I see.

486
00:55:35,355 --> 00:55:37,313
What's the name of your...

487
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:42,394
My what?

488
00:55:44,269 --> 00:55:46,561
Ball! What's the name of your ball?

489
00:55:46,811 --> 00:55:50,228
You're funny! Balls don't have names.

490
00:55:56,851 --> 00:55:58,851
It's all in place, Minister.

491
00:55:59,184 --> 00:56:01,017
The latest technology.

492
00:56:01,851 --> 00:56:04,310
Behind every light switch, even in the toilet.

493
00:56:04,435 --> 00:56:07,726
- Measure C in the hall...
- You said you'd find something!

494
00:56:07,891 --> 00:56:08,891
Find something!

495
00:56:10,475 --> 00:56:13,641
I'd advise even my worst enemy
not to disappoint me.

496
00:56:17,433 --> 00:56:18,766
Now get out of here!

497
00:56:27,889 --> 00:56:29,806
Nowack, you're to watch Christa-Maria.

498
00:56:29,973 --> 00:56:33,556
You'll report on every minute
that she's not with me.

499
00:56:35,637 --> 00:56:39,554
We revoked Hauser's travel permit
for the culture conference.

500
00:56:39,637 --> 00:56:43,930
Maybe that'll lead to something.
The two of them are very close.

501
00:56:45,555 --> 00:56:48,388
How's it going between CMS and the Minister?

502
00:56:48,555 --> 00:56:51,971
They're meeting tomorrow night, I think.

503
00:56:52,179 --> 00:56:56,221
That's good! Very good!
We have a lot to gain from this love story.

504
00:56:57,637 --> 00:56:59,262
Or a lot to lose.

505
00:57:00,095 --> 00:57:01,095
Don't forget that.

506
00:57:14,093 --> 00:57:16,759
I used to be afraid of just two things:

507
00:57:17,759 --> 00:57:20,384
Being alone, and not being able to write.

508
00:57:22,593 --> 00:57:24,676
Since Albert's death,
I don't care about writing

509
00:57:25,467 --> 00:57:26,967
or about other people.

510
00:57:28,883 --> 00:57:31,217
All I'm afraid of now is losing you.

511
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:35,341
You needn't be afraid tonight.

512
00:57:37,174 --> 00:57:39,131
I'm just going out for a few hours.

513
00:57:39,298 --> 00:57:40,715
Where to?

514
00:57:41,423 --> 00:57:44,215
An old classmate's in town.

515
00:57:45,131 --> 00:57:46,380
Really, Christa?

516
00:57:49,047 --> 00:57:52,588
- Really?
- How dare you!

517
00:57:55,922 --> 00:57:57,380
I know.

518
00:57:59,672 --> 00:58:01,671
I know where you're going.

519
00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:06,586
And I'm asking you not to go.

520
00:58:08,086 --> 00:58:09,920
You don't need him.

521
00:58:10,878 --> 00:58:12,003
You don't need him.

522
00:58:21,501 --> 00:58:23,126
I know about your medication too.

523
00:58:25,584 --> 00:58:28,333
And how little faith you have in your talent.

524
00:58:29,792 --> 00:58:31,457
Have faith in me, at least.

525
00:58:34,167 --> 00:58:35,833
Christa-Maria.

526
00:58:36,917 --> 00:58:38,958
You are a great artist.

527
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:45,331
I know that.
And your audience knows it too.

528
00:58:46,915 --> 00:58:48,581
You don't need him.

529
00:58:50,957 --> 00:58:52,541
You don't need him.

530
00:58:53,291 --> 00:58:54,624
Stay here.

531
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,497
Don't go to him.

532
00:59:01,289 --> 00:59:08,539
No? Don't I need him?
Don't I need this whole system?

533
00:59:12,288 --> 00:59:13,871
What about you?

534
00:59:15,121 --> 00:59:18,163
Then you don't need it either.
Or need it even less.

535
00:59:19,704 --> 00:59:22,037
But you get in bed with them too.

536
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,995
Why do you do it?

537
00:59:24,328 --> 00:59:26,452
Because they can destroy you too,

538
00:59:26,577 --> 00:59:29,577
despite your talent and your faith.

539
00:59:32,327 --> 00:59:36,201
Because they decide what we play,
who is to act,

540
00:59:36,243 --> 00:59:38,493
and who can direct.

541
00:59:41,867 --> 00:59:44,117
You don't want to end up like Jerska.

542
00:59:44,909 --> 00:59:46,659
And neither do I.

543
00:59:47,659 --> 00:59:49,700
That's why I'm going now.

544
00:59:50,867 --> 00:59:56,241
You're right about so many things,
and I want to change so much.

545
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:00,283
But I ask you,

546
01:00:01,282 --> 01:00:03,865
I implore you: Don't go!

547
01:00:04,823 --> 01:00:06,865
Well, boss, am I on time?

548
01:00:07,864 --> 01:00:10,406
Let me guess what those two are doing...

549
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,821
Come on, I'll take over.

550
01:00:14,863 --> 01:00:17,821
I don't want you
to do overtime because of me.

551
01:00:27,904 --> 01:00:29,945
"Don't go through that door."

552
01:00:30,029 --> 01:00:32,029
Where's she going?

553
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:35,986
To meet an old classmate.

554
01:00:42,068 --> 01:00:44,152
You'll have my detailed report tomorrow.

555
01:00:44,402 --> 01:00:45,860
I can manage.

556
01:00:49,734 --> 01:00:51,442
Good night.

557
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,353
What are you staring at?

558
01:01:56,436 --> 01:01:57,643
Soda water.

559
01:02:00,517 --> 01:02:03,309
No, uh... Vodka.

560
01:02:04,309 --> 01:02:05,559
Double.

561
01:02:12,475 --> 01:02:14,183
Another one.

562
01:02:29,264 --> 01:02:31,431
Can I have a cognac, please?

563
01:03:23,884 --> 01:03:25,050
Madam?

564
01:03:25,842 --> 01:03:28,424
Go away, I want to be alone.

565
01:03:29,132 --> 01:03:30,632
Ms. Sieland.

566
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:34,675
Do we know each other?

567
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:36,842
You don't know me, but I know you.

568
01:03:39,924 --> 01:03:41,631
Many people love you

569
01:03:41,673 --> 01:03:43,965
for who you are.

570
01:03:48,548 --> 01:03:52,131
- Actors are never 'who they are.'
- You are.

571
01:03:59,046 --> 01:04:01,129
I've seen you on stage.

572
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:07,170
You were more who you are...

573
01:04:10,337 --> 01:04:12,170
than you are now.

574
01:04:16,045 --> 01:04:17,753
So you know what I'm like.

575
01:04:18,128 --> 01:04:19,961
I'm your audience.

576
01:04:27,251 --> 01:04:29,793
- I have to go.
- Where to?

577
01:04:31,418 --> 01:04:34,625
I'm meeting an old classmate. I...

578
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:38,583
You see?
Just now you weren't being yourself.

579
01:04:40,791 --> 01:04:41,791
No?

580
01:04:42,249 --> 01:04:43,208
No.

581
01:04:55,998 --> 01:05:00,206
So you know her well,
this Christa-Maria Sieland.

582
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:04,497
What do you think...

583
01:05:05,205 --> 01:05:08,872
Would she hurt someone
who loves her above all else?

584
01:05:13,038 --> 01:05:15,913
Would she sell herself for art?

585
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:18,037
For art?

586
01:05:18,162 --> 01:05:21,953
You already have art.
That'd be a bad deal.

587
01:05:23,037 --> 01:05:25,244
You are a great artist.

588
01:05:26,912 --> 01:05:28,078
Don't you know that?

589
01:05:33,786 --> 01:05:35,327
And you are a good man.

590
01:06:11,448 --> 01:06:14,532
"When I begin my shift, 'Lazlo' and CMS"

591
01:06:14,656 --> 01:06:19,613
are arguing about whether CMS
should meet her classmate.

592
01:06:19,905 --> 01:06:23,780
Eventually, she leaves.
'Lazlo' seems unhappy about this.

593
01:06:25,988 --> 01:06:29,986
But after about 20 minutes, CMS returns,

594
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:32,361
to 'Lazlo's' surprise, and mine.

595
01:06:32,569 --> 01:06:38,028
He seems very happy about this.
Vigorous acts of intimacy follow.

596
01:06:41,569 --> 01:06:44,402
She says she'll never leave again.

597
01:06:44,610 --> 01:06:49,943
He says repeatedly: 'Now I'll have the strength,
now I'll do something.'

598
01:06:50,193 --> 01:06:54,401
This likely refers to writing a new stage play.

599
01:06:54,692 --> 01:06:59,817
In recent weeks, 'Lazlo's' playwriting
had been plagued by difficulties.

600
01:07:00,109 --> 01:07:02,734
What she means by her statement is unclear.

601
01:07:02,817 --> 01:07:07,275
Perhaps she intends to
take better care of his household.

602
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:10,191
"The rest of the night was peaceful."

603
01:07:11,065 --> 01:07:17,899
Oh, comrade... uh... It's just because...
He's sleeping too...

604
01:07:18,691 --> 01:07:19,982
Good report.

605
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:24,774
Really?

606
01:07:42,896 --> 01:07:45,312
I didn't know he was in such a bad way.

607
01:07:49,186 --> 01:07:50,728
Neither did I.

608
01:07:57,603 --> 01:07:59,394
"On One Who Made it to the Other Side:"

609
01:08:00,602 --> 01:08:03,602
The statistics office on Hans Beimler Street

610
01:08:03,727 --> 01:08:06,310
counts everything, knows everything.

611
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:09,851
How many shoes I buy a year: 2.3.

612
01:08:09,934 --> 01:08:12,433
How many books I read a year: 3.2.

613
01:08:12,475 --> 01:08:19,183
And how many pupils graduate
with straight A's every year: 6347.

614
01:08:19,350 --> 01:08:22,432
But there is one thing they don't count,

615
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:26,306
maybe because even bureaucrats find it painful,

616
01:08:26,556 --> 01:08:28,181
and that's suicides.

617
01:08:28,681 --> 01:08:31,556
If you call Beimler Street to ask

618
01:08:31,598 --> 01:08:34,390
how many people between the Elbe and the Oder,

619
01:08:34,682 --> 01:08:37,472
between the Baltic Sea and the Ore
Mountains despair drove to their death,

620
01:08:37,972 --> 01:08:39,847
our numbers oracle is silent.

621
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:42,347
But it may just note your name
for State Security...

622
01:08:42,555 --> 01:08:44,430
Those grey men

623
01:08:44,722 --> 01:08:50,303
who ensure safety in our land... and happiness.

624
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:54,928
In 1977, our country
stopped counting suicides.

625
01:08:55,678 --> 01:08:59,011
They called them 'self-murderers'.

626
01:08:59,803 --> 01:09:02,887
But it has nothing to do with murder.

627
01:09:03,303 --> 01:09:07,969
It knows no bloodlust, \no heated passion,

628
01:09:08,385 --> 01:09:13,178
it knows only death, the death of all hope.

629
01:09:13,261 --> 01:09:16,011
When we stopped counting,

630
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:19,551
only one country in Europe
drove more people to their death:

631
01:09:20,009 --> 01:09:21,093
Hungary.

632
01:09:21,301 --> 01:09:25,968
We came next, the land of
'Real Existing Socialism'.

633
01:09:26,051 --> 01:09:29,133
One of the uncounted
is Albert Jerska,

634
01:09:29,342 --> 01:09:30,967
the great director.

635
01:09:31,342 --> 01:09:33,216
"It's him I want to talk about today..."

636
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:40,674
I tried to get statistics that show...

637
01:09:40,716 --> 01:09:43,173
...that State Security operates more
effectively than we think!

638
01:09:43,256 --> 01:09:44,631
I foolishly rehearsed

639
01:09:53,215 --> 01:09:56,505
my speech for the West in here.

640
01:09:59,089 --> 01:10:02,004
Since then, I've become very musical.

641
01:10:04,296 --> 01:10:05,879
We can meet at my place.

642
01:10:13,545 --> 01:10:16,419
"3 p.m., Pankow Memorial"

643
01:10:22,335 --> 01:10:24,210
Well? Is this safe enough?

644
01:10:29,376 --> 01:10:31,126
My own 'bodyguard'.

645
01:10:31,251 --> 01:10:33,959
I call him Rolf.
That's probably his name, too.

646
01:10:36,834 --> 01:10:38,084
Fire away.

647
01:10:39,084 --> 01:10:40,167
Here.

648
01:10:51,248 --> 01:10:52,498
You want to publish this?

649
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:56,332
In the West, with your help.

650
01:11:02,205 --> 01:11:04,623
Will you help? Have you told Christa?

651
01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:05,915
No.

652
01:11:07,332 --> 01:11:08,373
I'll help you,

653
01:11:08,415 --> 01:11:12,039
as long as you don't tell her anything.

654
01:11:12,164 --> 01:11:13,246
What?

655
01:11:13,371 --> 01:11:15,538
Georg, it's for her own protection.

656
01:11:17,288 --> 01:11:18,705
This could be right for the 'Spiegel'.

657
01:11:18,871 --> 01:11:20,746
I'm friends with an editor there.

658
01:11:20,871 --> 01:11:22,663
Gregor Hessenstein. Know him?

659
01:11:22,788 --> 01:11:23,830
Not personally.

660
01:11:23,871 --> 01:11:25,453
You have to meet him.

661
01:11:26,911 --> 01:11:29,578
But you can't publish using your real name.

662
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:34,786
Unless your idea of fun
is a 48-hour interrogation.

663
01:11:36,119 --> 01:11:37,911
I'm cold!

664
01:11:39,035 --> 01:11:40,451
We could go to my place?

665
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:44,327
There's no State Security at my place!

666
01:11:44,493 --> 01:11:46,993
A friend of Margot Honecker,

667
01:11:47,035 --> 01:11:48,618
winner of the National Award...

668
01:11:48,702 --> 01:11:50,368
Second class!

669
01:11:50,910 --> 01:11:52,492
My apartment is clean, I tell you!

670
01:11:53,576 --> 01:11:56,616
If only we could be sure...

671
01:11:59,449 --> 01:12:02,283
I have an idea
how we can check your apartment.

672
01:12:02,908 --> 01:12:04,948
You know my uncle Frank,

673
01:12:05,073 --> 01:12:07,698
who visits from West Berlin every Saturday,

674
01:12:07,781 --> 01:12:10,239
with his big gold Mercedes.

675
01:12:11,072 --> 01:12:13,781
It seems a bit risky to me, Mr. Hauser.

676
01:12:14,489 --> 01:12:17,155
Yes, I agree with Georg.

677
01:12:17,321 --> 01:12:20,114
Hiding your nephew under the back seat?

678
01:12:20,281 --> 01:12:22,155
I'm really not sure.

679
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:25,613
Come on, they won't search under the seats.

680
01:12:25,670 --> 01:12:28,462
They'll look under the axles, tap the exhaust,

681
01:12:28,587 --> 01:12:31,252
then I'll be across. Paul too.

682
01:12:32,211 --> 01:12:36,668
The border guards aren't very bright.
You've got the wrong idea there.

683
01:12:39,668 --> 01:12:42,793
- Which border will you cross?
- Heinrich-Heine Street.

684
01:12:42,875 --> 01:12:44,584
Good old Henrich Heine.

685
01:12:44,625 --> 01:12:47,959
They know me and my gold Mercedes.

686
01:12:48,042 --> 01:12:50,999
I'm friends with the guards.

687
01:12:51,541 --> 01:12:54,666
Trust me, I'll call you in 2 hours,

688
01:12:54,749 --> 01:12:55,833
a Schultheiss beer in my hand,

689
01:12:55,916 --> 01:12:58,749
and report the news:

690
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:00,499
Paul's across.

691
01:13:02,249 --> 01:13:04,166
No! What about Paul's Stasi man?

692
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:09,457
Rolf! Rolfy, Rolfy...
He'll think that Paul's at home.

693
01:13:11,248 --> 01:13:13,123
Okay, I have to go.

694
01:13:13,332 --> 01:13:17,457
We wouldn't want him to suffocate, would we?

695
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,370
Another beer?

696
01:13:40,745 --> 01:13:42,829
Border control, Heinrich-Heine Street.

697
01:13:44,787 --> 01:13:45,995
Who is this?

698
01:13:47,036 --> 01:13:48,285
Who is this?

699
01:13:49,868 --> 01:13:51,118
No reply.

700
01:13:56,410 --> 01:13:58,160
Just this once, my friend.

701
01:14:22,323 --> 01:14:23,990
- Dreyman.
- Okay,

702
01:14:24,073 --> 01:14:26,364
Paul's plan worked!

703
01:14:26,697 --> 01:14:28,572
No border control at all?

704
01:14:28,614 --> 01:14:31,655
No, no special checks.

705
01:14:31,738 --> 01:14:33,613
Those boys aren't so bad.

706
01:14:33,821 --> 01:14:35,695
It worked as planned.

707
01:14:35,696 --> 01:14:38,363
Thanks for doing this, Mr. Hauser.

708
01:14:38,405 --> 01:14:43,194
Forget it, it wasn't all that dangerous.

709
01:14:43,278 --> 01:14:45,278
- Yeah, true.
- Yeah.

710
01:14:45,361 --> 01:14:47,861
See you soon, and thanks a lot.

711
01:14:47,903 --> 01:14:48,904
Bye.

712
01:14:58,568 --> 01:15:01,860
What do we do if they ask
what we're doing together?

713
01:15:07,984 --> 01:15:09,693
Then... we'll say.

714
01:15:11,609 --> 01:15:15,609
We'll say we're writing a stage play together.

715
01:15:16,776 --> 01:15:19,233
For the GDR's 40th anniversary.

716
01:15:19,941 --> 01:15:21,275
Yes!

717
01:15:21,608 --> 01:15:23,275
And it's kind of true.

718
01:15:26,983 --> 01:15:28,858
Who'd have thought our State Security

719
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:31,982
was so incompetent?

720
01:15:35,399 --> 01:15:39,524
Who'd have thought they were such idiots?

721
01:15:43,398 --> 01:15:45,147
Just you wait...

722
01:15:54,896 --> 01:15:58,896
"7.32 p.m. No further noteworthy incidents."

723
01:16:19,894 --> 01:16:23,058
Hello, comrade. Listen to this here!

724
01:16:26,517 --> 01:16:29,975
Sure, in 1967 there were many suicides.

725
01:16:30,142 --> 01:16:32,517
But why in 1977? You must explain.

726
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:35,350
You must describe
the social conditions more clearly.

727
01:16:36,848 --> 01:16:38,806
It should remain literature,

728
01:16:38,848 --> 01:16:40,556
not political agitation.

729
01:16:40,806 --> 01:16:42,307
The text is great.

730
01:16:42,516 --> 01:16:45,932
I just want to be sure people
understand it in the West.

731
01:16:46,016 --> 01:16:48,141
It'll cause a sensation either way.

732
01:16:49,181 --> 01:16:52,764
- That's Hauser!
- Of course it's Hauser.

733
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:55,430
He's not in the West!

734
01:17:01,638 --> 01:17:03,804
They're writing a play together.

735
01:17:05,762 --> 01:17:08,012
For the 40th anniversary.

736
01:17:08,762 --> 01:17:11,637
It doesn't sound like a play to me.

737
01:17:14,387 --> 01:17:16,095
No? Then what?

738
01:17:17,137 --> 01:17:19,887
I don't know... but not a play.

739
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:24,053
You think a lot, Sergeant Leye.

740
01:17:24,428 --> 01:17:26,512
You're not an intellectual, are you?

741
01:17:26,845 --> 01:17:29,427
Me? No... I'm not one of those.

742
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:31,927
Then don't behave like one.

743
01:17:33,010 --> 01:17:35,760
I chose you because you know
the equipment

744
01:17:35,843 --> 01:17:38,468
and don't ask questions.

745
01:17:39,468 --> 01:17:41,425
Leave the thinking to your superiors.

746
01:17:41,717 --> 01:17:44,883
Yes, Captain. I'll be off, then.

747
01:17:45,425 --> 01:17:48,299
Have a nice day...

748
01:17:48,424 --> 01:17:51,674
of work... I mean, I hope you enjoy your work.

749
01:17:56,674 --> 01:17:58,299
Maybe I can re-write this part.

750
01:18:00,049 --> 01:18:01,256
I'll send you

751
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:03,048
all the material we have.

752
01:18:03,173 --> 01:18:05,381
Can you do it in two weeks?

753
01:18:06,464 --> 01:18:08,672
Then I could run it as a cover story

754
01:18:09,255 --> 01:18:10,964
for the first week in March.

755
01:18:13,505 --> 01:18:14,630
It's Christa.

756
01:18:16,421 --> 01:18:17,463
Georg?

757
01:18:19,503 --> 01:18:22,587
Christa, this is Gregor Hessenstein.

758
01:18:23,878 --> 01:18:26,628
- Christa Sieland.
- Of course, I know that!

759
01:18:27,253 --> 01:18:29,087
So, what conspiracy are you cooking up?

760
01:18:30,044 --> 01:18:34,502
Hauser and I are writing a play
for the GDR's 40th anniversary.

761
01:18:34,586 --> 01:18:35,627
Together?

762
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:39,044
The 'Spiegel' may do an article on it.

763
01:18:39,169 --> 01:18:42,086
- And who'll play the lead role?
- We planned to ask you.

764
01:18:42,169 --> 01:18:44,210
Christa, who would you rather play:

765
01:18:44,251 --> 01:18:46,334
Lenin or his dear old mother?

766
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:48,209
You can choose.

767
01:18:49,042 --> 01:18:51,167
I see I'm not welcome here.

768
01:18:51,209 --> 01:18:53,125
I'll go for a nap.

769
01:19:00,998 --> 01:19:03,165
Your caution is praiseworthy.

770
01:19:04,123 --> 01:19:06,582
The fewer people know, the better.

771
01:19:06,623 --> 01:19:08,290
The Stasi is not to be toyed with.

772
01:19:14,164 --> 01:19:17,957
On that note, I brought something for you.

773
01:19:22,123 --> 01:19:25,746
I'd have preferred the whole pie.
I already have a typewriter.

774
01:19:25,830 --> 01:19:28,871
The Stasi can identify its typeface.

775
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:30,705
If they intercepted the text at the border,

776
01:19:30,788 --> 01:19:32,496
for your typewriter using,

777
01:19:32,538 --> 01:19:34,413
you'd end up in Hohenschonhausen.

778
01:19:34,538 --> 01:19:36,787
And that's no fun,

779
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:38,662
as Paul can confirm, right?

780
01:19:40,369 --> 01:19:43,244
I'm afraid I could only get
a red ink ribbon for this model.

781
01:19:43,328 --> 01:19:47,619
Do you mind writing it in red?

782
01:19:47,953 --> 01:19:49,411
That won't be a problem.

783
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:53,369
Is there somewhere you can hide it?

784
01:19:54,368 --> 01:19:57,702
- Yes, I'll find a place.
- Don't take it lightly.

785
01:19:58,410 --> 01:20:00,410
I don't want my next article to be about

786
01:20:00,452 --> 01:20:02,867
your disappearance!

787
01:20:02,951 --> 01:20:05,909
Nobody may know that this typewriter exists!

788
01:20:08,241 --> 01:20:10,450
Is this apartment really safe?

789
01:20:10,575 --> 01:20:11,991
Yes.

790
01:20:13,658 --> 01:20:15,657
It's the only place left in the GDR

791
01:20:15,699 --> 01:20:17,740
where I can say what I want.

792
01:20:18,615 --> 01:20:20,990
Fine, then let's drink to that!

793
01:20:23,906 --> 01:20:26,407
This is the real stuff.

794
01:20:27,824 --> 01:20:32,739
To you! To letting all of Germany
see the true face of the GDR!

795
01:20:40,113 --> 01:20:43,321
Cheers. It's better than the Russian stuff!

796
01:20:43,904 --> 01:20:45,612
To your success!

797
01:21:02,694 --> 01:21:05,069
I must see Comrade Grubitz.

798
01:21:07,651 --> 01:21:12,067
Tomorrow at 2.30 p. m...

799
01:21:12,984 --> 01:21:18,152
Tell him that if he blows the cover,
we'll shut down the entire parish!

800
01:21:18,193 --> 01:21:19,526
It's easy!

801
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,650
He can call the Pope and complain!

802
01:21:22,858 --> 01:21:25,733
Okay, I've spent enough time on this nonsense.

803
01:21:27,066 --> 01:21:28,733
Wiesler, I'm glad you're here.

804
01:21:29,608 --> 01:21:31,191
I have to show you something.

805
01:21:32,856 --> 01:21:38,481
"Prison Conditions for Subversive Artists
Based on Character Profile."

806
01:21:38,689 --> 01:21:39,814
Pretty scientific, eh?

807
01:21:41,314 --> 01:21:42,940
And look at this:

808
01:21:44,607 --> 01:21:49,647
"Dissertation supervisor: A. Grubitz."
That's great, isn't it?

809
01:21:52,313 --> 01:21:54,063
I only gave him a B...

810
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:58,105
They shouldn't think
getting a doctorate with me is easy.

811
01:21:58,230 --> 01:22:00,229
But this is first-class.

812
01:22:00,354 --> 01:22:04,770
Did you know that there are just 5 types of artists?

813
01:22:05,686 --> 01:22:07,353
Your guy, Dreyman,

814
01:22:07,478 --> 01:22:11,103
is a type 4. A "hysterical anthropocentrist."

815
01:22:11,685 --> 01:22:13,102
Can't bear being alone,

816
01:22:13,185 --> 01:22:15,019
always talking, needing friends.

817
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:17,476
That type should never be brought to trial.

818
01:22:17,559 --> 01:22:19,227
They thrive on that.

819
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:22,727
Temporary detention is the best way

820
01:22:22,810 --> 01:22:24,559
to deal with them.

821
01:22:24,601 --> 01:22:27,433
Complete isolation and no set release date.

822
01:22:27,434 --> 01:22:29,392
No human contact the whole time,

823
01:22:29,475 --> 01:22:31,100
not even with the guards.

824
01:22:31,475 --> 01:22:33,308
Good treatment,

825
01:22:33,392 --> 01:22:35,892
no harassment, no abuse, no scandals...

826
01:22:35,975 --> 01:22:38,349
nothing they could write about later.

827
01:22:39,516 --> 01:22:42,474
After 10 months, we release.

828
01:22:43,224 --> 01:22:44,431
Suddenly.

829
01:22:45,098 --> 01:22:46,806
That guy won't cause us any more trouble.

830
01:22:46,931 --> 01:22:48,473
Know what the best part is?

831
01:22:48,598 --> 01:22:52,139
Most type 4s we've processed in this way

832
01:22:52,972 --> 01:22:55,889
never write anything again! Or paint anything,

833
01:22:55,930 --> 01:22:58,555
or whatever artists do...

834
01:22:59,097 --> 01:23:02,389
And that without any use of force...

835
01:23:02,972 --> 01:23:04,388
Just like that! Kind of...

836
01:23:05,179 --> 01:23:06,513
like a present.

837
01:23:08,138 --> 01:23:11,221
What brings you here?
Developments with Dreyman?

838
01:23:11,762 --> 01:23:14,512
That's why I'm here.

839
01:23:15,428 --> 01:23:17,719
I think the time has come...

840
01:23:18,594 --> 01:23:19,595
For what?

841
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:23,637
For us to slim down the operation.

842
01:23:24,845 --> 01:23:26,802
I don't want to run day and night shifts

843
01:23:26,886 --> 01:23:29,968
for such an uncertain case.

844
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:31,510
Uncertain, eh?

845
01:23:32,593 --> 01:23:35,177
You don't think we'll find anything

846
01:23:35,261 --> 01:23:36,386
for the Minister?

847
01:23:36,469 --> 01:23:39,177
Maybe if we're more flexible...

848
01:23:39,761 --> 01:23:43,259
If we watch 'Lazlo' outside his own four walls.

849
01:23:46,925 --> 01:23:49,009
Shall I give the case to Udo?

850
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:52,009
I'd like to continue it myself.

851
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:54,341
Why?

852
01:23:55,173 --> 01:23:57,090
It could produce results.

853
01:23:58,382 --> 01:24:00,882
I just need to plan more flexibly,

854
01:24:01,882 --> 01:24:06,173
when I come and go, days and nights...

855
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:09,171
Maybe he's up to something outside.

856
01:24:13,756 --> 01:24:16,131
Something doesn't feel right here.

857
01:24:19,547 --> 01:24:21,338
There's something you're hiding.

858
01:24:29,879 --> 01:24:32,379
Alright, I'll take Udo off the case.

859
01:24:33,379 --> 01:24:36,086
I can use him for this church case.

860
01:24:36,793 --> 01:24:38,752
Give me a request in writing.

861
01:24:39,043 --> 01:24:41,543
Write as a reason:"Lack of suspicious acts."

862
01:24:46,792 --> 01:24:48,667
And, Wiesler!

863
01:24:51,542 --> 01:24:52,500
A piece of advice for you:

864
01:24:53,584 --> 01:24:54,959
We're not at school anymore.

865
01:24:55,459 --> 01:24:57,291
Projects aren't about grades,

866
01:24:57,292 --> 01:24:59,459
but success.

867
01:25:15,747 --> 01:25:18,622
"The state statistics office"

868
01:25:18,664 --> 01:25:20,913
counts everything, knows everything.

869
01:25:21,413 --> 01:25:23,956
How many shoes I buy a year: 2.3.

870
01:25:24,456 --> 01:25:26,664
How many books I read a year: 3.2.

871
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:34,830
"And how many pupils graduate
with straight A's every year: 6347."

872
01:25:43,662 --> 01:26:00,910
"5 p.m. Lazlo reads the first act of
his anniversary play to Hauser and Wallner."

873
01:26:34,905 --> 01:26:40,572
DENTAL PRACTICE

874
01:27:45,565 --> 01:27:47,689
We're not writing a play, Christa.

875
01:27:47,772 --> 01:27:49,064
You don't have to tell me.

876
01:27:49,855 --> 01:27:52,439
But I want to. It's a text...

877
01:27:52,522 --> 01:27:54,438
Don't tell me.

878
01:27:55,563 --> 01:27:58,605
Maybe I am as unreliable as your friends say.

879
01:28:01,021 --> 01:28:02,813
But I... I'm with you now...

880
01:28:04,021 --> 01:28:05,854
No matter what.

881
01:28:41,224 --> 01:28:44,974
Minister Riesenhuber, author of the report,

882
01:28:45,016 --> 01:28:49,516
said there is no quick fix
for saving damaged forests.

883
01:28:50,182 --> 01:28:52,430
East-West German relations under strain.

884
01:28:53,014 --> 01:28:55,930
'Spiegel' magazine today published

885
01:28:55,972 --> 01:28:58,472
a text by an unnamed East German author

886
01:28:58,514 --> 01:29:02,889
about suicide in the German Democratic Republic.

887
01:29:03,722 --> 01:29:07,303
This follows a series of suicides by prominent

888
01:29:07,428 --> 01:29:10,345
East-Berlin artists, the latest being Albert Jerska.

889
01:29:10,887 --> 01:29:14,013
After being blacklisted for 7 years,

890
01:29:14,096 --> 01:29:17,013
Jerska committed suicide on January 5th.

891
01:29:17,138 --> 01:29:22,052
In 1977, the GDR ceased publishing
any data relating to suicides.

892
01:29:22,261 --> 01:29:26,052
That year, Hungary was the only country
in Europe with a higher suicide rate.

893
01:29:27,387 --> 01:29:29,012
Yes, Sir...

894
01:29:30,969 --> 01:29:32,219
But we...

895
01:29:33,551 --> 01:29:36,135
General, our man at the 'Spiegel'

896
01:29:36,218 --> 01:29:38,718
got us a photostat of the original.

897
01:29:39,010 --> 01:29:41,676
Congratulations! So who wrote it?

898
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:44,759
He doesn't know, but using the typeface, we'll...

899
01:29:44,884 --> 01:29:47,300
You're hopeless! Get me names!

900
01:29:47,633 --> 01:29:50,258
I will, as soon as we get the results.

901
01:29:50,259 --> 01:29:52,550
If not, you'll be put against the wall.

902
01:30:00,008 --> 01:30:02,048
Andrea, where's the graphologist?

903
01:30:02,590 --> 01:30:06,507
Thus I conclude that it is a domestic
typewriter produced for export,

904
01:30:06,548 --> 01:30:09,215
most likely a 'Kolibri' travel model,

905
01:30:09,340 --> 01:30:13,505
made by the VEB Groma.

906
01:30:13,506 --> 01:30:16,171
If the ink were black, I could be more precise.

907
01:30:18,296 --> 01:30:19,505
Who owns such a typewriter?

908
01:30:19,838 --> 01:30:22,046
There are none registered in the GDR.

909
01:30:22,505 --> 01:30:25,045
What does that mean?
What does Hauser use?

910
01:30:25,129 --> 01:30:29,421
Paul Hauser uses a 'Valentino' typewriter,
made by Olivetti.

911
01:30:29,671 --> 01:30:34,004
- That model has a more horizontal...
- Yes, yes! And Wallner?

912
01:30:36,044 --> 01:30:38,461
He writes on an Optima 'Elite'.

913
01:30:40,461 --> 01:30:41,794
Georg Dreyman?

914
01:30:41,836 --> 01:30:44,460
He writes his first drafts by hand,

915
01:30:44,543 --> 01:30:47,543
then types them up
on a Wanderer 'Torpedo'.

916
01:30:47,585 --> 01:30:49,251
He's never used anything else.

917
01:30:52,542 --> 01:30:55,792
How big is this 'Kolibri' typewriter?

918
01:30:55,834 --> 01:30:58,958
It's one of the smallest available:

919
01:30:59,083 --> 01:31:03,040
19.5cm x 99cm x 19.55cm.

920
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:06,583
So it's as easy to smuggle as a book.

921
01:31:09,875 --> 01:31:11,666
Thank you. You may go.

922
01:31:15,998 --> 01:31:17,164
Goodbye, comrade.

923
01:31:23,081 --> 01:31:26,913
"The Secret Suicide Statistics"

924
01:31:29,622 --> 01:31:32,122
Andrea, put me through to Wiesler.

925
01:31:32,788 --> 01:31:44,037
"4 p.m. The group is exhausted
from so much writing."

926
01:31:55,785 --> 01:31:58,660
- Yes?
- Have you heard about this article?

927
01:31:59,285 --> 01:32:02,160
- In the 'Spiegel'? Yes.
- How so?

928
01:32:03,702 --> 01:32:06,659
Hauser called Dreyman
and told him about it.

929
01:32:07,784 --> 01:32:12,033
Wiesler, this is very important.
Both for my career and for yours.

930
01:32:13,075 --> 01:32:17,575
Did he mention who may be behind it?
Or do you have any ideas?

931
01:32:18,575 --> 01:32:22,575
I don't think he mentioned anything.
No... nothing at all.

932
01:32:25,282 --> 01:32:31,074
A 'Spiegel' editor crossed the border
using a false name on the 27th,

933
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:34,156
and spent four hours here.

934
01:32:34,239 --> 01:32:37,905
Dept. VI followed him to Prenzlauer Berg,
then lost his trail.

935
01:32:38,738 --> 01:32:41,030
Did he have contact with Dreyman?

936
01:32:42,072 --> 01:32:45,446
- Wouldn't I have noted it in the report?
- Yes, of course.

937
01:32:46,821 --> 01:32:49,029
But I smell a writer behind this text.

938
01:32:49,112 --> 01:32:51,195
I'd be astonished if I'm wrong.

939
01:32:51,903 --> 01:32:53,820
So keep your ears open!

940
01:33:00,903 --> 01:33:02,195
Shit!

941
01:33:18,693 --> 01:33:20,150
Get in.

942
01:33:34,399 --> 01:33:38,816
If one of your staff deceives you,
you punish him, right?

943
01:33:38,899 --> 01:33:40,607
Sure, sure!

944
01:33:40,982 --> 01:33:44,357
Even a woman? Right?

945
01:33:44,566 --> 01:33:45,732
But of course!

946
01:33:47,482 --> 01:33:52,064
Isn't everyone who serves a great man
part of his staff?

947
01:33:52,772 --> 01:33:53,939
You could see it like that...

948
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:57,272
Indeed, you'd have to see it like that.

949
01:33:59,689 --> 01:34:04,812
This is where she gets her illegal medication.
Christa-Maria Sieland.

950
01:34:06,312 --> 01:34:09,270
You should know this, it's your department.

951
01:34:10,937 --> 01:34:13,979
It's up to you whether you ruin her or not,

952
01:34:15,395 --> 01:34:18,852
but I never want to see her
on a German stage again.

953
01:34:22,686 --> 01:34:24,436
Now get out.

954
01:34:31,142 --> 01:34:32,392
Shut the door!

955
01:34:34,142 --> 01:34:37,850
Ms. Sieland? Please follow us.
We have some questions.

956
01:34:41,141 --> 01:34:42,433
Come along.

957
01:35:02,222 --> 01:35:03,056
So...

958
01:35:05,097 --> 01:35:08,179
Comrade Sieland, a beautiful career you had, hm?

959
01:35:10,471 --> 01:35:12,345
A pity really. You were good.

960
01:35:13,262 --> 01:35:14,637
You were very good indeed.

961
01:35:16,303 --> 01:35:18,345
Just too short-lived.

962
01:35:19,262 --> 01:35:20,802
Do have a seat.

963
01:35:28,511 --> 01:35:32,302
What do actors do when they can't act anymore?

964
01:35:36,427 --> 01:35:38,761
Please...

965
01:35:40,094 --> 01:35:43,551
Isn't there anything I can do for you?

966
01:35:45,010 --> 01:35:50,592
- For... State Security?
- It's a little late for that.

967
01:35:52,217 --> 01:35:54,425
I know nearly all our artists.

968
01:35:54,467 --> 01:35:56,299
I could find out a lot.

969
01:35:56,383 --> 01:35:59,798
I believe you.
But it won't help you now.

970
01:36:10,590 --> 01:36:13,464
Maybe there's something else I could do?

971
01:36:16,006 --> 01:36:18,672
Something we might both find agreeable.

972
01:36:21,256 --> 01:36:25,379
Unfortunately,

973
01:36:26,087 --> 01:36:28,754
you've made an enemy
of a very powerful man.

974
01:36:29,629 --> 01:36:32,295
Therefore, I have less freedom
than would normally be the case.

975
01:36:35,629 --> 01:36:37,793
Is there no way I can save myself?

976
01:36:39,710 --> 01:36:42,085
I'm sorry, madam.

977
01:36:53,126 --> 01:36:54,626
There is one possibility.

978
01:36:55,376 --> 01:37:00,459
Since you spend so much time
with writers and artists...

979
01:37:02,084 --> 01:37:06,165
You don't know anything about an article
from this week's 'Spiegel', do you?

980
01:37:07,207 --> 01:37:09,040
An article about suicide.

981
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:04,535
State Security! Open the door!

982
01:38:12,784 --> 01:38:13,784
Open up!

983
01:38:19,533 --> 01:38:21,574
He's turned on the light in his study.

984
01:38:22,074 --> 01:38:24,282
Go in before he destroys any evidence.

985
01:38:25,157 --> 01:38:27,032
Crowbar!

986
01:38:30,032 --> 01:38:32,198
I don't think that'll be necessary.

987
01:38:33,365 --> 01:38:35,990
- What's the matter, comrades?
- We have a warrant to search the premises.

988
01:38:36,281 --> 01:38:37,448
Warrant is here.

989
01:38:38,823 --> 01:38:40,864
- What are you looking for?
- It's confidential.

990
01:38:42,531 --> 01:38:44,322
Boysen, Muller: bedroom.

991
01:38:44,405 --> 01:38:46,280
Greska: kitchen, bathroom, hall.

992
01:38:46,363 --> 01:38:49,446
Heise and Thomas: living room, study.

993
01:38:49,487 --> 01:38:50,362
Go!

994
01:39:40,815 --> 01:39:42,481
What do you burn in here?

995
01:39:44,106 --> 01:39:45,148
Substandard texts.

996
01:39:51,398 --> 01:39:53,856
A lot of Western literature, eh?

997
01:39:55,480 --> 01:39:57,689
That book was a gift from Margot Honecker.

998
01:40:01,147 --> 01:40:03,897
- Status?
- All according to plan.

999
01:40:08,396 --> 01:40:12,978
We found nothing,
except Western books and newspapers.

1000
01:40:15,437 --> 01:40:18,102
- No trace to be found!
- Did you search thoroughly?

1001
01:40:19,561 --> 01:40:21,977
Yes, Comrade! What's our next move?

1002
01:40:28,769 --> 01:40:30,935
- Comrade?
- Pull out your men!

1003
01:40:33,393 --> 01:40:38,392
In the unlikely event that damage has
occurred, you may claim compensation.

1004
01:40:39,559 --> 01:40:41,725
I'm sure everything's in perfect order.

1005
01:41:05,056 --> 01:41:05,972
Yes?

1006
01:41:06,097 --> 01:41:09,388
Wiesler, I'll be expecting you
in Hohenschonhausen at 9 a.m. tomorrow.

1007
01:41:14,263 --> 01:41:16,221
Okay, I'll say what we're all thinking:

1008
01:41:16,305 --> 01:41:18,096
It was Christa-Maria.

1009
01:41:18,263 --> 01:41:20,512
The Stasi got her, and she ratted on you.

1010
01:41:23,553 --> 01:41:24,469
It wasn't her.

1011
01:41:25,428 --> 01:41:26,469
How can you be so sure?

1012
01:41:27,469 --> 01:41:30,261
You yourself said she wasn't home last night.

1013
01:41:34,260 --> 01:41:36,384
She knows the hiding place.

1014
01:41:37,801 --> 01:41:38,926
Yes, she knows.

1015
01:41:45,553 --> 01:41:46,928
So if you're right,

1016
01:41:46,969 --> 01:41:49,342
and the search was due to her,

1017
01:41:49,551 --> 01:41:51,592
then she's our guardian angel.

1018
01:41:57,634 --> 01:41:59,342
I'm here to see Lt. Col. Grubitz.

1019
01:42:00,758 --> 01:42:02,132
Captain Wiesler.

1020
01:42:03,215 --> 01:42:04,757
Interrogation room 76.

1021
01:42:21,881 --> 01:42:23,756
Yes! Come in.

1022
01:42:28,546 --> 01:42:29,380
Sit down.

1023
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:37,920
So?

1024
01:42:41,253 --> 01:42:42,294
What was that about?

1025
01:42:43,253 --> 01:42:45,210
You're asking me what that was about?

1026
01:42:47,877 --> 01:42:49,835
What do you suspect Dreyman of?

1027
01:42:52,127 --> 01:42:53,626
He wrote the 'Spiegel' article.

1028
01:42:58,626 --> 01:42:59,917
Who alleges that?

1029
01:43:03,959 --> 01:43:05,541
Come with me!

1030
01:43:15,957 --> 01:43:17,415
Here.

1031
01:43:19,498 --> 01:43:22,498
I don't know how you could be
so sloppy as to miss all of this!

1032
01:43:24,331 --> 01:43:26,997
But I know you differently,
especially as an interrogator.

1033
01:43:28,122 --> 01:43:29,997
So I'm giving you one last chance.

1034
01:43:31,287 --> 01:43:33,496
Bring in prisoner 662, now!

1035
01:43:38,455 --> 01:43:40,080
Are you still on the right side?

1036
01:43:44,121 --> 01:43:45,496
Yes.

1037
01:43:45,621 --> 01:43:47,371
Then don't screw it up again.

1038
01:44:12,158 --> 01:44:13,868
Shall I restrain the prisoner?

1039
01:44:14,784 --> 01:44:18,118
No, she's an informant now. You may go.

1040
01:44:24,449 --> 01:44:26,241
So you're my commanding officer?

1041
01:44:27,074 --> 01:44:28,407
Write.

1042
01:44:29,282 --> 01:44:30,366
Then command me.

1043
01:44:46,364 --> 01:44:48,529
In another 10 hours...

1044
01:44:50,238 --> 01:44:52,404
No, in 9 and a half,

1045
01:44:53,196 --> 01:44:54,946
Mr. Roessing will tell the audience that

1046
01:44:55,029 --> 01:44:58,613
you, for health reasons, cannot appear.

1047
01:45:00,238 --> 01:45:03,820
And that will be your last mention
in the acting world.

1048
01:45:05,652 --> 01:45:06,652
Is that what you want?

1049
01:45:09,902 --> 01:45:12,694
Tell us where the evidence is hidden.

1050
01:45:14,443 --> 01:45:15,693
There is no evidence,

1051
01:45:16,651 --> 01:45:19,610
and no typewriter. I made it all up.

1052
01:45:21,150 --> 01:45:22,192
I hope not.

1053
01:45:23,817 --> 01:45:26,067
If so, we'll have to keep you here.

1054
01:45:27,150 --> 01:45:31,317
A false statement is perjury,
which carries around 2 years in prison.

1055
01:45:34,358 --> 01:45:36,399
Dreyman will go to prison anyway,

1056
01:45:37,066 --> 01:45:38,732
on account of your statement...

1057
01:45:41,190 --> 01:45:44,773
and the material
we've already found in the apartment.

1058
01:45:48,356 --> 01:45:50,815
Save yourself, at least.

1059
01:45:52,606 --> 01:45:54,689
You have no idea how many people

1060
01:45:54,730 --> 01:45:57,147
are in jail here for senseless heroics.

1061
01:46:00,605 --> 01:46:02,438
Don't forget your audience.

1062
01:46:03,063 --> 01:46:07,188
"Don't forget your audience!"
He has some funny ideas!

1063
01:46:11,729 --> 01:46:14,313
Don't forget what the state has done for you...

1064
01:46:16,645 --> 01:46:18,728
Your whole life long.

1065
01:46:18,977 --> 01:46:21,394
Now you can do something for the state.

1066
01:46:21,477 --> 01:46:23,394
And it will thank you.

1067
01:46:26,061 --> 01:46:28,227
Tell me where the typewriter's hidden.

1068
01:46:30,935 --> 01:46:33,017
Dreyman will never find out.

1069
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,475
I'll let you go immediately,

1070
01:46:36,267 --> 01:46:38,434
and we'll strike only after you're back with him.

1071
01:46:40,184 --> 01:46:43,185
You'll manage to feign surprise, I'm sure.

1072
01:46:45,016 --> 01:46:47,558
And tonight you'll be back on stage.

1073
01:46:50,058 --> 01:46:51,599
In your element.

1074
01:46:53,933 --> 01:46:55,349
In front of your audience.

1075
01:47:05,472 --> 01:47:07,472
Tell me where the documents are.

1076
01:47:18,095 --> 01:47:19,304
Where are they?

1077
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:26,095
They're in the apartment...

1078
01:47:29,219 --> 01:47:31,469
Under the doorsill,

1079
01:47:31,844 --> 01:47:36,927
between the living room and the hallway.

1080
01:47:40,218 --> 01:47:42,759
You can remove it.

1081
01:47:56,758 --> 01:48:00,217
Is this where you mean?
Mark the exact place with a cross.

1082
01:48:30,671 --> 01:48:34,504
You look worn out.
Remember, you're an informant now.

1083
01:48:34,629 --> 01:48:37,712
That means responsibilities,
like conspiracy and confidentiality,

1084
01:48:37,921 --> 01:48:42,545
but also privileges...

1085
01:49:05,293 --> 01:49:06,667
Guard!

1086
01:49:07,582 --> 01:49:08,707
Call Wiesler for me!

1087
01:49:08,874 --> 01:49:11,707
Col. Wiesler has left the premises, comrade.

1088
01:49:11,999 --> 01:49:13,583
I see!

1089
01:49:15,625 --> 01:49:17,125
Alright. Stand down.

1090
01:49:33,663 --> 01:49:35,912
What does a rider do when he's thrown?

1091
01:49:36,037 --> 01:49:37,579
He gets back on again.

1092
01:49:37,912 --> 01:49:39,871
Go inside. Sleep it off.

1093
01:49:40,454 --> 01:49:43,204
What happened has nothing to do with the house.

1094
01:49:43,954 --> 01:49:45,579
No, but with the whole country.

1095
01:50:51,571 --> 01:50:52,404
Christa!

1096
01:50:52,488 --> 01:50:57,238
Stop, I was at Kerschner's and they had no water.
I need a shower.

1097
01:51:15,152 --> 01:51:17,735
You were in a hurry to get here!

1098
01:51:17,860 --> 01:51:20,068
- Operation 'Lazlo' is still in progress!
- Are they both inside?

1099
01:51:20,151 --> 01:51:21,318
Yes.

1100
01:51:22,776 --> 01:51:24,235
Here's today's report.

1101
01:51:25,276 --> 01:51:28,734
The last report for Operation 'Lazlo'.

1102
01:51:50,398 --> 01:51:51,732
Why didn't you call me?

1103
01:51:52,732 --> 01:51:53,816
What?

1104
01:51:54,858 --> 01:51:56,606
Why didn't you call me?

1105
01:51:57,814 --> 01:51:59,064
I was out in the country.

1106
01:52:01,564 --> 01:52:03,606
Can you hand me the nail brush?

1107
01:52:08,813 --> 01:52:11,562
The Stasi was here.
They searched the apartment.

1108
01:52:12,895 --> 01:52:13,895
Who was here?

1109
01:52:16,104 --> 01:52:18,270
State Security! Open up!

1110
01:52:19,187 --> 01:52:20,229
Stay here.

1111
01:52:29,019 --> 01:52:32,394
Hello, Comrade Dreyman.
I'm Lt. Col. Grubitz from State Security.

1112
01:52:32,769 --> 01:52:36,560
I just wanted to make sure
they did a thorough job last night.

1113
01:52:36,935 --> 01:52:39,392
Your study? We'll start there.

1114
01:52:48,474 --> 01:52:50,474
Men, search carefully
for notes hidden in the books.

1115
01:53:10,681 --> 01:53:12,721
Oh, what do we have here?

1116
01:53:15,721 --> 01:53:17,846
This doorsill doesn't look kosher to me.

1117
01:53:23,595 --> 01:53:27,011
Could it be... a secret compartment?

1118
01:53:41,010 --> 01:53:43,052
Let her go. She's not a suspect.

1119
01:53:59,217 --> 01:54:00,842
The actress...

1120
01:54:32,421 --> 01:54:34,837
I was too weak.

1121
01:54:34,879 --> 01:54:37,546
I can never put right what I've done wrong.

1122
01:54:37,671 --> 01:54:40,087
There's nothing to put right!
You understand? Nothing.

1123
01:54:40,171 --> 01:54:42,587
I moved the ty...

1124
01:54:53,086 --> 01:55:01,418
Forgive me, forgive me... Forgive me, forgive me...

1125
01:55:28,873 --> 01:55:32,123
Take your men back to headquarters.
This mission is over.

1126
01:55:47,578 --> 01:55:52,120
I've concluded the mission, Comrade Dreyman.
We must have received an erroneous tip-off.

1127
01:55:53,620 --> 01:55:54,620
Sorry.

1128
01:55:57,161 --> 01:55:58,662
Come on.

1129
01:56:57,904 --> 01:57:00,696
There's one thing you should understand, Wiesler.

1130
01:57:02,029 --> 01:57:03,363
Your career is over.

1131
01:57:04,738 --> 01:57:07,652
Even if you were too smart to leave any traces.

1132
01:57:09,152 --> 01:57:13,444
You'll end up in some cellar,
steam-opening letters until you retire.

1133
01:57:14,444 --> 01:57:16,319
That means the next 20 years.

1134
01:57:17,111 --> 01:57:18,651
20 years!

1135
01:57:20,359 --> 01:57:21,443
That's a long time.

1136
01:57:31,650 --> 01:57:35,066
"Mikhail Gorbachev elected as leader
of the Soviet Union's Communist Party."

1137
01:57:38,483 --> 01:57:41,233
4 YEARS AND 7 MONTHS LATER

1138
01:57:59,689 --> 01:58:00,982
The Wall has come down!

1139
01:58:06,106 --> 01:58:07,356
Yes, the Wall has come down!

1140
01:58:13,271 --> 01:58:17,811
The border guards have opened the gates.
The excitement is enormous!

1141
01:58:17,812 --> 01:58:21,187
People are streaming out in thousands!
It's unbelievable!

1142
01:58:21,395 --> 01:58:25,061
Dear listeners, November 9th, 1989,

1143
01:58:25,186 --> 01:58:29,394
will go down in history!

1144
01:58:51,683 --> 01:58:56,475
TWO YEARS LATER

1145
01:58:58,641 --> 01:59:01,307
What's wrong, my child?

1146
01:59:01,806 --> 01:59:03,806
Your Arthur is dead.

1147
01:59:07,014 --> 01:59:11,056
Arthur... Can't you be wrong, just this once?

1148
01:59:11,139 --> 01:59:13,555
I saw him this morning!

1149
01:59:13,680 --> 01:59:16,847
No, sister. Believe me.
He fell to his death.

1150
01:59:18,347 --> 01:59:21,305
The loyal men surround him, as you do me,

1151
01:59:21,888 --> 01:59:23,638
and despite the high sun, cast

1152
01:59:23,763 --> 01:59:28,011
seven shadows on his noble dead body.

1153
01:59:29,053 --> 01:59:33,053
Crushed by the mighty wheel. I see it,

1154
01:59:33,720 --> 01:59:36,136
though I'd rather see any other horror.

1155
01:59:38,969 --> 01:59:41,634
Why am I not spared these visions?

1156
01:59:43,176 --> 01:59:47,426
Elena! Go home and mourn.

1157
01:59:48,176 --> 01:59:50,509
I will finish your shift.

1158
01:59:59,508 --> 02:00:02,091
Too many memories, eh?

1159
02:00:06,550 --> 02:00:09,216
I couldn't stay in there either.

1160
02:00:12,007 --> 02:00:13,715
But what's this I hear?

1161
02:00:14,465 --> 02:00:17,424
You've not written since the Wall fell?

1162
02:00:18,049 --> 02:00:19,589
That's not good.

1163
02:00:21,048 --> 02:00:23,714
After all our country invested in you.

1164
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:27,838
Although I understand you, Dreyman.

1165
02:00:27,922 --> 02:00:30,131
What is there to write about in this new Germany?

1166
02:00:31,089 --> 02:00:34,797
Nothing to believe in, nothing to rebel against...

1167
02:00:38,754 --> 02:00:41,296
Life was good in our little Republic.

1168
02:00:41,504 --> 02:00:44,462
Many people only realize that now.

1169
02:00:44,754 --> 02:00:49,211
- There is one thing I do need to ask you.
- Whatever you want.

1170
02:00:49,586 --> 02:00:51,170
Why was I never under surveillance?

1171
02:00:53,002 --> 02:00:55,710
Everyone else was. Why not me?

1172
02:01:02,043 --> 02:01:03,793
You were under full surveillance!

1173
02:01:05,168 --> 02:01:06,876
We knew everything about you.

1174
02:01:08,251 --> 02:01:09,626
Full surveillance?

1175
02:01:11,042 --> 02:01:14,458
Every inch was bugged. The full program.

1176
02:01:15,708 --> 02:01:16,708
Impossible!

1177
02:01:19,583 --> 02:01:22,166
Take a look behind your light switches.

1178
02:01:22,832 --> 02:01:24,248
We knew everything.

1179
02:01:26,331 --> 02:01:31,831
We knew that you couldn't give
our little Christa what she needed.

1180
02:01:37,996 --> 02:01:40,788
To think that people like you
once ruled a country...

1181
02:03:05,738 --> 02:03:08,653
RESEARCH SITE AND MEMORIAL

1182
02:03:18,319 --> 02:03:22,568
It'll be a moment, there should be
more than one file in your case.

1183
02:04:07,063 --> 02:04:09,439
I ordered them chronologically.

1184
02:04:09,481 --> 02:04:12,479
Old ones at the top,
and the newer ones underneath.

1185
02:04:14,355 --> 02:04:15,771
My respects!

1186
02:04:37,893 --> 02:04:43,267
Operation 'Lazlo'. Operation 'Lazlo', subject:
Georg Dreyman, code-name 'Lazlo', is launched.

1187
02:04:43,601 --> 02:04:47,142
The lead came from Minister Bruno Hempf.

1188
02:04:49,851 --> 02:04:56,100
'Lazlo' takes delivery of a daily Western newspaper
without official permission.

1189
02:04:56,350 --> 02:04:59,391
I suggest not taking any action

1190
02:04:59,475 --> 02:05:02,558
so as not to arouse suspicion of surveillance.

1191
02:05:04,349 --> 02:05:07,014
'Lazlo' and CMS unwrap presents,

1192
02:05:07,098 --> 02:05:09,889
then presumably have intercourse.

1193
02:05:19,263 --> 02:05:23,179
The visitor was Paul Hauser's uncle from West Berlin.

1194
02:05:23,471 --> 02:05:27,346
They tell him about a play
that Hauser

1195
02:05:27,387 --> 02:05:30,637
and 'Lazlo' will write
for the GDR's 40th anniversary.

1196
02:05:34,012 --> 02:05:37,428
We expect further information on the play,

1197
02:05:37,470 --> 02:05:39,720
a plot summary etc.

1198
02:05:41,345 --> 02:05:43,385
Contents of act 1:

1199
02:05:44,385 --> 02:05:46,302
Lenin is in constant danger.

1200
02:05:47,094 --> 02:05:51,468
Despite increasing external pressure,
he sticks to his revolutionary plans.

1201
02:05:53,926 --> 02:05:55,633
Lenin is exhausted.

1202
02:06:02,383 --> 02:06:03,216
HGW...

1203
02:06:05,882 --> 02:06:08,382
HGW XX-7...

1204
02:06:21,548 --> 02:06:23,840
I, Christa-Maria Sieland,

1205
02:06:24,173 --> 02:06:29,048
freely commit myself to work unofficially
for State Security.

1206
02:06:30,131 --> 02:06:34,546
This decision is the result of my conviction that...

1207
02:06:39,379 --> 02:06:40,671
Georg Dreyman

1208
02:06:40,754 --> 02:06:44,004
wrote the 'Spiegel' article
"One Who Made it to the Other Side."

1209
02:06:44,588 --> 02:06:47,836
His accomplices were the journalist Paul Hauser...

1210
02:06:56,670 --> 02:07:00,334
Christa Sieland was arrested on March 10th

1211
02:07:00,459 --> 02:07:03,709
for drug abuse, on Minister Hempf's indication.

1212
02:07:03,918 --> 02:07:07,334
She was released at 1.50 p.m. on March 11th,

1213
02:07:07,501 --> 02:07:10,668
having revealed 'Lazlo's hiding place

1214
02:07:10,793 --> 02:07:14,666
and signing up as informant 'Marta'.

1215
02:07:19,999 --> 02:07:21,792
1.50 p. m...

1216
02:07:23,542 --> 02:07:24,958
So when did she...

1217
02:07:25,541 --> 02:07:28,081
After the unsuccessful house
search of March 11, 1985,

1218
02:07:28,165 --> 02:07:32,581
and 'Marta's' fatal accident,

1219
02:07:32,748 --> 02:07:34,831
Operation 'Lazlo' was terminated.

1220
02:07:39,122 --> 02:07:43,288
Note: HGW's promotion ban
takes effect immediately.

1221
02:07:43,829 --> 02:07:45,954
Transfer to Dept. M,

1222
02:07:46,079 --> 02:07:50,246
with the recommendation not to entrust him
with missions under his sole responsibility.

1223
02:07:52,620 --> 02:07:57,577
10:50 a.m.: Resume surveillance
outside 'Lazlo's' house.

1224
02:08:00,120 --> 02:08:04,286
At 3.10 p.m., 'Marta' comes directly from
Hohenschonhausen to his apartment.

1225
02:08:05,619 --> 02:08:08,369
House search and report to follow.

1226
02:08:09,411 --> 02:08:13,827
End of Operation 'Lazlo'. HGW, 3.15 p.m.

1227
02:08:32,199 --> 02:08:34,033
Who is HGW XX-7?

1228
02:09:19,154 --> 02:09:20,654
Stop.

1229
02:10:11,355 --> 02:10:13,687
Back to Hufeland Street.

1230
02:10:38,686 --> 02:10:41,477
TWO YEARS LATER

1231
02:11:19,888 --> 02:11:23,472
"Georg Dreyman"
"Sonata for a Good Man"

1232
02:11:34,720 --> 02:11:39,261
"A Novel" "Dedicated to HGW XX-7, in gratitude."

1233
02:11:58,300 --> 02:11:59,675
29,80.

1234
02:12:00,592 --> 02:12:01,467
Shall I gift-wrap it?

1235
02:12:03,300 --> 02:12:05,925
No, it's for me.
