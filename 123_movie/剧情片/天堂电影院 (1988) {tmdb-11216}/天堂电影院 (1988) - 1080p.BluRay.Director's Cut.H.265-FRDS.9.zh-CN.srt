好 一言为定 现在快滚
Right. Then we agree. Now scram.

126
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,510
这算什么约定?
What kind of a deal is that?

127
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:03,500
我的东西为何要你保管?
If they're mine, how come you keep them?

128
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,120
别再回来 否则我会揍你!
Don't come back,or I'll thrash you!

129
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,890
先开枪 再思考
"Shoot first, think later."

130
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:26,490
懦夫才没有这种能耐
"This is no job for weaklings, traitorous dog."

131
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,470

否则我就打烂你的脸

the war's over, but...why doesn't Papa come back?

137
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:14,320
这些天他会回来的 你会看到的
He'll come back, you'll see. One of these days.

138
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,150
我不记得他了
I don't remember him.

139
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,320
苏俄在哪里?
Where's Russia?

140
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:25,490
来回都要好几年
It takes years to get there and years to come back.

141
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,620
睡吧 很晚了
Go to bed. It's late.

142
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,340

Going, it's all downhill and all the saints help out.

240
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,160
但是回来的时候 圣人只会看着
But coming back, the saints just watch.

241
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,570
这也许是天意

就算我不能进放映室
I don't say I should come in the booth...

257
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:06,410
总能和你做朋友吧?
but can't we at least be friends?

258
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:11,510
以外表选朋友 以智慧选敌人
"I choose my friends for looks, my enemies for intelligence."

259
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:15,650
你太狡猾 不能当我的朋友
You're too foxy to be my friend.

260
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,550
我经常告诉我的孩子

261
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:20,620
交友要谨慎
"Be careful how you choose your friends."

262
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:24,520
你又没有小孩
You haven't got any children.

263
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:29,690
等我有了 自然会说
When I do, I'll tell them.

264
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:37,100
不哭 不哭 没事了
Don't cry, don't cry. It's all right.

265
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:41,010
火已经灭了 没事了 我在这儿呢
The fire's out. It's over. I'm here.

266
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,050
怎么了?

270
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,660
我叫你别把底片放在床下靠近火盆
I told you not to keep your film under the bed by the fire pan.

271

照片也烧坏了!
Even the photographs burned!

272
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,500
差点把房子也烧了
Nearly set fire to the house.

273
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:19,580
你和你的烂电影!
You and your stupid movies!

274
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:24,580
你这把年纪了还和小孩玩不丢脸吗?
Aren't you ashamed at your age to play with a boy?

275
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,410
为什么看着我? 我又没做什么
Why look at me? What did I do?

276
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:30,550
谁给的他底片?
Who gave him the film?

277
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:34,720
不要再给他了 他都要疯了 疯了!
Don't do it again. He goes crazy. Crazy!

278
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,120
我听到的都是电影 艾费多
All I hear is movies, Alfredo.

279
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,520
艾费多 电影!
Alfredo, movies!

280
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:43,000
你发誓以后不让他进电影院 发誓!
Swear you won't let him in again. Swear it!

281
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:48,200
我向你保证
You have my word.

282
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:55,390
上帝答应我 会派你爸爸回来教训你
God grant me this. Send your father home to whip you!

283
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:58,820
爸爸不会回来了 我知道为什么
Papa won't come back, and I know why.

284
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,290
他死了
He's dead.

285
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,790
没这回事
That's not true.

286
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:07,860
他一定会回来的
You'll see, he'll come back.

287
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:34,390
他们抽烟抽得就像个烟囱
They smoke like chimneys.

288
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:44,200
不行 去买张票
No. Go buy a ticket.

289
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,470
不行!
No!

290
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,020
出了什么事?
What was that?

291
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:12,700
我要宰了你们! 你们给我走着瞧!
I'll make mincemeat of you! You'll reckon with me!

292
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,690
混蛋!
Asshole!

293
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,740
安娜阿姨

295
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:53,970
不要骂我 阿姨让我把午饭给你送过来
Don't blame me. Your wife told me to bring your lunch.

296
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:54,610
拿来
Give it to me.

297
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:59,440
我告诉了妈妈 底片不是你给的
I told my mother you didn't give me the film.

298
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,920
不是你的错
It wasn't your fault.

299
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:06,320
我以为底片会着火是个玩笑
I thought it was a joke about film catching fire.

300
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,010
我来就是想告诉你这些 那我走了
I just wanted to tell you. Now I'll go.

301
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:15,560
多多 过来
Toto, come here.

302
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:20,020
来 坐下
Come on, come sit down.

303
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,970
听着 我10岁就干起了这行
Now listen. I got into this business at age ten.

304
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:30,700
以前 我们没有先进的机器
Back then, we didn't have fancy machines.

305
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,980
电影没有声音
Movies were silent.

306
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:38,250
放映机得用手去转把手
You turned the projector by hand with a crank.

307
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:44,290
整整的一大天! 它又很重 那个该死的把手
The whole live long day! And it was hard, that damn crank.

308
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:49,020
要是你累了 动作慢了一点
If you got tired and slowed down a bit...

309
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,960
就像一个炮弹 呼! 东西都着了
like a shot, whoom! everything burned.

310
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,700
那为什么不教我?
So why not teach me?

311
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:02,170
现在已经没有把手 而且又是那么容易
Now that there's no crank and it's dead easy.

312
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:04,880
因为我不想教
Because I don't want to.

313
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,680
这份工作不适合你
It's no kind of job for you.

314
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:12,520
你就像一个奴隶 总是很孤单
You're like a slave and always alone.

315
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,650
一部电影你要看一百遍 你没有别的事可做
You see a film 100 times. You've nothing else to do.

316
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:19,060
只能对着葛丽泰嘉宝和泰隆鲍华说话 像个疯子
You talk to Garbo and Tyrone Power like a loony bird.

317
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,890
你像个驴一样工作
You work like a burro.

318
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:25,960
就连复活节 圣诞节也不例外
Even holidays Easter, Christmas.

319
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,660
你只有在星期五才能休息
You only get Good Friday off.

320
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:35,200
这还是托耶稣受难的福
And if they hadn't stuck Christ on a cross we'd even work then.

321
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,000
那你为什么不换工作呢?
So why don't you change jobs?

322
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,320
因为我是个笨蛋
Because I'm a nitwit.

323
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:52,520
周围还有谁会用放映机?
Who else around here could run a projector?

324
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:58,020
没人会 只有我这样的傻瓜会用
Nobody. It takes an imbecile like me.

325
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,090
我的运气一向不好
And I never had any luck.

326
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:06,040
你还想干我这没出息的行业?
So! Want to be a stick-in-the-mud like me? How about it?

327
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,200
不想
No.

328
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,970
这就对了 多多
Attaboy, Toto.

329
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,740
我告诉你是为你好
I only tell you for your own good.

330
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:18,380
窝在这里 夏天闷死人
Cooped up here. Suffocate in summer,

331
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,940
冬天冷死人 空气又不好
freeze to death in winter. Breathing fumes.

332
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:25,250
挣的钱只够养个小鸡
And you earn chicken feed.

333
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:28,080
你一点都不喜欢这个工作吗?
Don't you like anything about it?

334
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:32,120
日久生情 有时候你听到...
Oh, it grows on you. Sometimes you listen...

335
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:36,760
满屋子人哈哈大笑
and the house is full of people giggling and laughing.

336
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,190
你也会很开心
Then you're happy too.

337
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:42,060
那种感觉很好
It makes you feel good to hear them.

338
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:45,400
好像是你在逗他们笑
Like you're the one who made them laugh

339
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:49,750
你让他们忘记烦恼

340
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,640
我喜欢这样
That part I like.

341
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:07,620
你不会懂的 你在干嘛?
I might as well speak Greek! What're you up to?

342
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:11,360
假装在听 趁机乱动
Pretend to listen, then play the clown!

343
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:15,300
你母亲说得对! 你这个糊涂蛋!
Your mother's right! You're a scatterbrain!

344
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,670
这个淘气蛋怎么做的? 他看看就会了
How'd the rascal do it? He learned by watching.

345

Take a look at Ciccio. So spiffy, you'd hardly know him.

不 不 多多 不可以休学

意思是这不是你的终身事业

总有一天你还会做别的事

You're right, Alfredo, it's out of focus.

543
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:46,390

01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,360
很难解释
Too hard to explain.

545

Blood all over the floor, like a lake.

571
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:29,850
血泊旁边还有一头母牛 也要死了
Over the lake comes another heifer about to die.

572
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:39,650
怎么停住了? 我们看到什么?
Why'd you stop? What do we see?

573
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:43,730
没什么 我们什么都看不到 画面很模糊
Nothing. We don't see anything. It's all fuzzy.

574
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:47,920
一个女人
A woman.

575
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:51,290
是个女人
It's a woman.

576
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:56,180
对 我在车站看到的一个女孩
Yes, a girl I saw at the station.

577
01:07:56,180 --> 01:07:58,880
她长什么样子?
What's she like?

578
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:01,450
她很美
She's very nice.

579
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:06,690
跟我同岁 苗条 棕色长发
My age, slim, long hair, brown.

580
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:10,550
大眼睛 非常蓝 纯洁而且坦白
Big eyes, very blue, honest and direct.

581
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:12,860
嘴唇上有个小美人痣
A little beauty markon her lip.

582
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:16,330
非常小 近看才看得到
Very small.You only see it up close.

583
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:22,930
她微笑时 你感觉像...我不知道
When she smiles, you feel like...l don't know.

584
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:24,500
爱
Love.

585
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:28,040
这就是爱
Love.

586
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:37,410
我知道的是...蓝眼睛的女人最难追
I know how it is...The blue-eyed ones are the worst.

587
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:41,320
不管你怎么做 她们都不会成为你的朋友
No matter what you do, they'll never be your friends.

588
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:42,980
什么都没用
Nothing for it.

589
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:47,060
越是煎熬 越刻骨铭心
The bigger the man, the deeper his imprint.

590
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:50,230
如果他爱上了 他只能忍受
And if he loves, he suffers,

591
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:52,400
明知道那是个死胡同
knowing it's a dead-end street.

592
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:57,030
你刚才说的这些话很美 也很伤感
That's nice, what you just said. But sad.

593
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,240
不是我说的
I didn't say it.

594
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:03,540
是约翰韦恩在"山上的牧羊者"中说的
It was John Waynein "The Shepherd of the Hills."

595
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:05,970
你这个老贼 艾费多!
You old pirate, Alfredo!

596
01:09:36,430 --> 01:09:37,890
你好 艾莲娜
Hello, Elena.

597
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:40,990
你好 你为什么要跑?
Hello. Why're you running?

598
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:43,870
因为...
Because...

599
01:09:45,330 --> 01:09:48,170
我想告诉你...
I wanted to tell you...

600
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:51,600
你记得我们什么时候...
you remember when we...

601
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:56,000
天气真好 不是吗?
Nice day, isn't it?

602
01:10:00,850 --> 01:10:03,680
是啊 真的很好
Yes, really nice.

603
01:10:05,090 --> 01:10:08,360
抱歉 我要走了 再见
Excuse me, I have to go. Bye.

604
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:09,980
再见
Bye

605
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:17,570
我真笨 我真笨!
What a jerk. What a jerk!

606
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:21,370
"天气真好? 不是吗? " 太傻了!
"Nice day, isn't it?" Of all the assholes!

607
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:27,440
我告诉过你 你以为我在开玩笑
I told you so. You thought I was joking.

608
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:32,440
相信我的话 蓝眼睛女孩最难追
But take it from me, the blue-eyed ones are the worst.

609
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:35,920
为什么? 一定会有办法让她明白的
But why? There must be a way to make her understand.

610
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:39,220
最好别试 对于情感 任何事都难明白...
Don't even try. With feelings, there's nothing to understand...

611
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:43,190
而且没有办法解释
and no way to explain.

612
01:10:43,190 --> 01:10:45,050
好像是你创造了这个世界!
Oh, you made the world!

613
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:47,730
我无意冒犯上帝...
With due respect to the Lord...

614
01:10:47,730 --> 01:10:50,400
他两三天就创造了世界
who made the world in 2, 3 days...

615
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,800
我会比他慢一点...
I'd have taken a bit longer...

616
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:56,490
但说得谦虚点 我会造得更好些
but in all modesty, I would've done it better.

617
01:10:56,510 --> 01:11:00,330
我说过...你总是知道答案
Like I said...you always have an answer.

618
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:07,150
就为你 多多 我给你讲个故事
Just for you, Toto, I'll tell you a story.

619
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:09,220
让我们坐一会儿
Let's sit down a minute.

620
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,720
无尽的烦恼
Misery of miseries.

621
01:11:13,090 --> 01:11:16,890
从前 一个国王...
Once a king...

622
01:11:16,990 --> 01:11:22,420
为他最可爱的公主举办了一场宴会
gave a feast for the loveliest princesses in the realm.

623
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:29,340
有个卫兵看到国王的女儿从他身边走过
A soldier who was standing guard saw the king's daughter go by.

624
01:11:29,470 --> 01:11:31,940
她实在太美了...
She was the most beautiful of all...

625
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:35,410
他立刻坠入情网
and he instantly fell in love.

626
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:38,280
但是一个卑微的士兵...
But what is a simple soldier...

627
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:41,080
怎么能配得上国王的女儿?
next to the daughter of a king?

628
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:46,750
后来 他终于有机会见到她...
Well, at last he succeeded in meeting her...

629
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:50,760
他告诉她 他不能没有她
and he told her he could no longer live without her.

630
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:55,560
公主被他深深的感情所打动...
The princess was so taken by the depth of his feeling...

631
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:58,370
她就告诉那个士兵...
that she said to the soldier...

632
01:11:58,370 --> 01:12:01,130
"你如果连续一百个昼夜
"If you can wait...

633
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:06,100
日日夜夜守在我的阳台下...
for 100 days and 100 nights under my balcony...

634
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:10,680
最后 我就以心相许"
at the end of it, I shall be yours."

635
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:16,890
于是 士兵去等了一天...
With that, the soldier went and waited one day...

636
01:12:16,990 --> 01:12:19,850
两天 然后十天 二十天
two days, then ten, then twenty.

637
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:23,220
每个晚上公主向外看...
Each evening the princess looked out...

638
01:12:23,390 --> 01:12:25,350
他从来都不动!
and he never moved!

639
01:12:25,390 --> 01:12:29,350
下雨 刮风 下雪 他一直在那里
In rain, in wind, in snow, he was always there.

640
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:32,770
小鸟在他头上拉屎 蜜蜂蛰他...
Birds shat on his head, bees stung him...

641
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:34,800
他还是一动不动
but he didn't budge.

642
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:41,500
到了最后 第90天...
At the end of 90 days...

643
01:12:43,410 --> 01:12:45,310
他已经变得...
he had become...

644
01:12:47,650 --> 01:12:50,000
苍白虚弱
all dry, all white.

645
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:54,650
眼泪从他的双眼流下来
Tears streamed from his eyes.

646
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:56,530
他控制不住
He couldn't hold them back.

647
01:12:56,530 --> 01:13:01,430
他甚至连睡觉的力气都没了
He didn't even have the strength to sleep.

648
01:13:01,430 --> 01:13:06,660
公主把一切都看在眼里
And all that time, the princess watched him.

649
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:11,190
终于到了最后 那是第九十九个夜晚...
At long last, it was the 99th night...

650
01:13:11,190 --> 01:13:18,100
士兵站起来 搬起椅子 走了
and the soldier stood up, took his chair and left.

651
01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:19,980
什么? 这就是结局?
What? At the end?

652
01:13:21,650 --> 01:13:24,420
这就是那个结局
At the very end.

653
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:27,150
别问那是什么意思 我也不知道
And don't ask what it means. I don't know.

654
01:13:29,730 --> 01:13:32,720
要是你明白了 你要告诉我
If you understand it, you tell me.

655
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:49,530
只有一个拷贝?
Only one print?

656
01:13:49,730 --> 01:13:51,750
你知道我需要两个
You know I need two.

657
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:56,320
一个给新天堂 一个给邻镇
One for the Paradiso, one for the next town.

658
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,570
你答应过的
You promised.

659
01:13:59,570 --> 01:14:01,640
海报都贴了 你要兑现承诺!
I put up posters, made commitments!

660
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:03,870
如果你对不起我 小心点!
lf you screw me, watch out!

661
01:14:03,870 --> 01:14:08,880
一份拷贝给两个电影院! 你会为此付出代价的!
One print for two theaters! You'll pay for this!

662
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,920
我是拿坡里人
I'm from Naples

663
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:13,150
我会让你死得很难看!
and you will see it and die!

664
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:54,580
我们看了婴儿床 孩子已经睡了
We see the crib. The child's asleep.

665
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:09,660
萝莎!
Rosa!

666
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:18,510
"她的药呢? 快想办法! "
"Where is her medicine? Do something!"

667
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:22,150
律师曾告诉我
The lawyer told me.

668
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:23,260
现在我知道了
Now I know.

669
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:25,290

670
01:15:25,290 --> 01:15:26,790
"现在我知道了"

671
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:31,960
每个人都知道 对 每个人都应该知道

672
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:36,170
"每个人都知道"
"Everyone must know."

673
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:39,000

You believe me?

674
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,900
"你相信我吗? "
"You believe me?"

675
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:44,180
是的 我相信你

676

"是的 我相信你"

677
01:15:55,550 --> 01:15:58,620
我们的家! 梦想许久的家!
Our own home. How I've dreamed of it.

678
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:02,150
"- 我们的家! - 梦想许久的家! "
"- Our own home. - How I've dreamed of it."

679
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,870

680
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:11,140

687
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:59,780

It's been a half hour!

700
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,530

What can I do?

701
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:31,540
那个混蛋呢? 我会死得很惨
Where is that son of a jackass? I'll be ruined.

702
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:36,280
安静 安静
Calm down, calm down.

703
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:41,050

710
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:05,380
改天再放上集好了

712
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:15,450
安静 安静!
Quiet, quiet!

713
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:17,960
我看过整部电影

714
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:21,360
我可以说给你们听

715
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:19,130
艾费多 帮个忙
Alfredo, do me a favour.

716
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:23,890
帮我缠住神父
Help me to tied the father up.

717
01:20:38,510 --> 01:20:40,380
艾费多 什么事?
Alfredo, what is it?

718
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:41,380
神父
Father.

719
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:43,190
我不能...有人要告解
I can't...The Host is on the altar.

720
01:20:43,190 --> 01:20:47,090
神父 我急切地需要你...
Father, I need you urgently...

721
01:20:47,090 --> 01:20:52,090
因为我心存疑惑 灵魂饱受折磨
because I have doubts terrible doubts tormenting my soul.

722
01:20:52,090 --> 01:20:53,160
你的灵魂
Your soul.

723
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:54,090
对
Yes

724
01:20:59,770 --> 01:21:01,040
神父 我有罪
Father, I've sinned.

725
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,270
待会再说
Do that after.

726
01:21:02,270 --> 01:21:03,170
但是你是...
But who...

727
01:21:03,170 --> 01:21:05,640
待在那里 别动 假装没事
Stay there. Don't move. Just act normal.

728
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:08,040
我是沙瓦托
It's Salvatore.

729
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:10,310
你怎么在这里?
How'd you get here?

730
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:15,920
艾费多 太可怕了
Alfredo, that's a terrible thing to say.

731
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:18,120
我知道
I know.

732
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:21,160
但是现世利益上的奇迹
But take the miracle of the loaves and fishes.

733
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:23,630
怎样?
What about it?

734
01:21:23,630 --> 01:21:27,930
我常在想...有可能吗?
I always wonder...how is it possible?

735
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:30,400
我要告诉你
I had to talk to you.

736
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:44,410
你好美 艾莲娜 那就是我想告诉你的
You're beautiful, Elena. That's what I wanted to tell you.

737
01:21:44,410 --> 01:21:48,820
我们见面时 我老是说错话...
When we meet, I can't say anything right...

738
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:52,510
因为你令我颤抖
because you give me the shivers.

739
01:21:52,690 --> 01:21:57,050
我不知道别人会怎么做
I don't know what others do in these cases.

740
01:21:57,090 --> 01:21:58,560
这是我的第一次

741
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:02,790
我爱上你了
But I'm in love with you.

742
01:22:02,860 --> 01:22:05,100
神父 我有罪
Father, I have sinned.

743
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:11,370
我以圣父圣子圣灵之名赦免你 安心地去吧
I absolve you,in the name of the Father,Son and Holy Ghost.Go in peace.

744
01:22:15,610 --> 01:22:18,270
你笑起来更美
When you laugh, you're even prettier.

745
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:30,360
沙瓦托 你很可爱 我也很喜欢你...
Salvatore, you're very sweet, and I like you very much...

746
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:33,850
但是我不爱你
but I don't love you.

747
01:22:36,830 --> 01:22:39,030
没不管 我会等
I don't care. I'll wait.

748
01:22:39,170 --> 01:22:41,000
等什么?
What?

749
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:45,670
等你爱上我 听我说
For you to fall in love with me. Now listen.

750

752

你要是改变心意 请打开你的窗户
When you change your mind, open your window.

753
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,960
这样我就懂了
That's all. I'll understand.

754
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:01,020
你懂了吗?
You understand now?

755
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:07,620
懂了 我终于重见光明
Yes, finally, I see the light.

756
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:13,830
下次别再提异端邪说
Next time, don't talk heresy.

757

你在电影院大火中生还 但是一旦碰上地狱之火...
You survived the theater fire, but from the Eternal Fire...

758
01:23:18,270 --> 01:23:21,070
谁也救不了你

整个夏天跟我的家人在一起 没有你 日子特别漫长
A whole summer with my family, far from you, my days here go on forever.

777
01:30:30,710 --> 01:30:33,570
我的眼前不断浮现你的名字 在一本书里...
I see your name everywhere in a book...

778
01:30:33,610 --> 01:30:36,290
一个字谜里 一张报纸里
a crossword puzzle, a newspaper.

779
01:30:36,310 --> 01:30:38,690
你总是出现在我的眼前
You're always before my eyes.

780
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:41,400
今天有一个坏消息

781
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:45,670
十月我们要搬到巴勒摩 我会在那里上大学

782

所以我们无法天天见面了
So we won't see each other every day.

783

不过别担心 不管什么时候我能离开...

786
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:21,830
凭借上帝的力量 凭借人类的运行! 升起来!
By God's might, by man's running! Rise up!

787
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:50,450
为什么这个腐烂的夏天还不结束?
When will this rotten summer end?

788
01:31:50,450 --> 01:31:52,990
在电影里 它早该结束了
In a film, it'd already be over.

789
01:31:52,990 --> 01:31:57,150
淡出 切到暴风雨 那样不是很棒吗?
Fade-out: cut to storm. Wouldn't that be great?

790

The job'll still be here. I'll wait, you hear?

803
01:33:34,620 --> 01:33:37,890
别那么沮丧 来吧! 走!
Don't look so gloomy. Come on! Hup!

没有人知道她在哪儿?
And no one knows where?

807

你再不讲就死定了 混蛋王八蛋!

808
01:34:41,890 --> 01:34:44,620

你瘦了 终于回来了
You're thinner. Put you through it, eh?

812
01:36:29,530 --> 01:36:33,870
他们说你从不出门 也不跟比人说话
They tell me you never go out and you never talk to anybody.

813
01:36:33,870 --> 01:36:36,100
为什么?
Why?

814
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:39,190
你知道原因

815
01:36:39,190 --> 01:36:45,610
这是迟早要来的事
Sooner or later the time comes...

816
01:36:45,610 --> 01:36:49,320
讲不讲都没有差别
whether you talk or don't talk, it's the same thing.

817
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:52,480
还不如闭嘴
So you might as well shut up.

818
01:36:59,030 --> 01:37:00,930
这里好热
It's hot here.

819
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:03,860
带我去海边

820
01:37:04,370 --> 01:37:08,100
一次聚会 有个中尉偷捏女孩的屁股
At a party, a lieutenant pinches this girI's ass.

821
01:37:08,170 --> 01:37:12,040
她转过身 竟然是上校的女儿
She turns around. It's the coloneI's daughter.

822
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:13,640
中尉吓得急忙说
Terrified, the lieutenant says...

823
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:17,140
"如果你的心也像我刚才摸到的那么硬"
"If your heart is as hard as what I just felt, "

824
01:37:17,140 --> 01:37:18,810
"我就死定了"
"I'm a dead man."

825
01:37:24,990 --> 01:37:26,750
你没见过她吗?
You haven't seen her?

826
01:37:28,270 --> 01:37:29,230
没有
No.

827
01:37:30,490 --> 01:37:32,550
也没有人知道她在哪
And no one knows where she is.

828
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:38,800
大概这就是天意
Probably that's how it was meant to be.

829
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:43,330
我们 我们每一个人 人人都有所追寻

这里被诅咒了
This land is cursed.

832
01:37:49,010 --> 01:37:51,940
每天待在这里
Living here day by day...

833
01:37:52,010 --> 01:37:55,540
你会把这里当成世界的中心
you think it's the center of the world.

834
01:37:55,580 --> 01:37:59,420
你会相信什么都不会改变

然后你离开了...一年 两年

等你回来时 一切都变了 牵挂也断了
When you come back, everything's changed. The thread's broken.

837
01:38:08,830 --> 01:38:13,830
你来寻找的已经不在 曾经是你的也已经消失
What you came to find isn't there. What was yours is gone.

838
01:38:13,830 --> 01:38:17,530
你不得不离开很长一段时间...
You have to go away for a long time...

839
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:25,150
很多年后 你回来找到你的亲友
many years before you can come back and find your people.

840
01:38:25,150 --> 01:38:28,550
回到你的故乡
The land where you were born.

841
01:38:28,650 --> 01:38:33,990
但是现在不可能 你比我还盲目
But now, no. It's not possible. Right now you're blinder than I am.

842
01:38:34,150 --> 01:38:36,320
是谁讲的? 贾利古柏?
Who said that? Gary Cooper?

843
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:37,920
詹姆斯史都华? 亨利方达?
James Stewart? Henry Fonda?

844
01:38:38,060 --> 01:38:39,960
不 多多
No, Toto.

845
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:44,730
没人说过这些

846

这次全是我说的
This time it's all me.

847
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:53,640
人生和电影不一样
Life isn't like in the movies.

848
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:58,310
人生辛苦多了
Life is much harder.

849
01:38:59,410 --> 01:39:01,570
离开这里
Get out of here.

850
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:03,650
回到罗马去
Go back to Rome.

851
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:07,390
你还年轻 世界是你的
You're young, the world is yours.

852
01:39:08,260 --> 01:39:10,380
我已经老了
And I'm old.

853
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:14,600
我不想再听你说了
I don't want to hear you talk anymore.

854
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:17,000
我想听关于你的事
I want to hear talk about you.

855
01:40:35,910 --> 01:40:38,170
不要回来
Don't come back.

856
01:40:38,710 --> 01:40:41,020
不要想到我们
Don't think about us.

857
01:40:41,020 --> 01:40:44,020
不要回头 不要写信
Don't look back. Don't write.

858
01:40:44,020 --> 01:40:49,420
不要因为思乡而放弃 忘了我们
Don't give in to nostalgia. Forget us all.

859
01:40:49,420 --> 01:40:52,930
要是你放弃回来了 就别来见我
If you do and you come back, don't come see me.

860
01:40:52,930 --> 01:40:57,230
我不会让你进我家 懂吗?
I won't let you in my house. Understand?

861
01:41:03,390 --> 01:41:09,340
谢谢你为我做的一切

不管你最后要干什么 热爱它
Whatever you end up doing, love it.

863
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:23,620
就像小时候你热爱放映机那样
The way you loved the projection booth when you were a little squirt.

864
01:41:31,630 --> 01:41:35,800
他走了 多多! 再见!
He's left.Toto! Good-bye!

865
01:41:37,970 --> 01:41:39,910
多多!

866
01:41:42,210 --> 01:41:44,610
来晚了点 真可惜
Got here too late, what a shame.

867
01:42:44,090 --> 01:42:48,020
是多多 我知道是他
It's Toto. I knew it.

868
01:43:03,210 --> 01:43:04,010
多多
Toto.

869
01:43:04,010 --> 01:43:05,740
你好吗?
How are you?

870
01:43:21,190 --> 01:43:24,430
看看这房子多漂亮
See how nice the house is?

871
01:43:24,430 --> 01:43:29,070
我们把它全部翻新了 全都要感谢你
We had it all redone, all thanks to you.

872
01:43:29,070 --> 01:43:32,430
我有个惊喜要给你 来
I have a surprise for you. Come.

873
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:34,570
累吗?
Are you tired?

874
01:43:34,570 --> 01:43:38,580
葬礼前你还有时间休息
You have time to rest before the funeral.

875
01:43:38,580 --> 01:43:42,380
不累 妈妈 飞回来才一个小时
No, Mama, it's only an hour by plane.

876
01:43:42,380 --> 01:43:46,420
都这么多年了还告诉我这个
Don't tell me that after all these years.

877
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:50,550
来 你的东西全都在这里
Come. I put everything in here. All your things.

878

你来他一定很开心 多多

879
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,970
他老是提到你

880
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:50,000
临死前也是
Right up to the end.

881
01:45:53,050 --> 01:45:57,610
他真的...他真的很爱你

他有东西要给你

883

884
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:54,990
你过得怎么样
How have you been?

885
01:48:04,570 --> 01:48:07,710
什么时候关门的?
When did you close it down?

886
01:48:07,710 --> 01:48:12,020
六年前的五月 没人来了
Six years ago in May. Nobody came anymore.

887
01:48:12,020 --> 01:48:14,020
您比我清楚 狄维塔先生...
You know better than l, Mr. Di Vita...

888
01:48:14,020 --> 01:48:17,950
经济问题 电视 录影带
the economy, TV, videos.

889
01:48:17,950 --> 01:48:21,650
老电影业已经成了回忆
The old movie business is just a memory.

890
01:48:22,160 --> 01:48:26,630
政府买去盖停车场
The city bought the site for a parking lot.

891
01:48:26,630 --> 01:48:31,900
周六就要拆了 真叫人难过
They're demolishing it Saturday. It's too bad.

892
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:37,710
为何叫"狄维塔先生"? 我以前是你的雇工
What's this "Mr. Di Vita"? You used to order me around.

893
01:48:37,710 --> 01:48:40,140
现在你是个大人物了 这就不同了
Now that you're a big shot, it's a little different.

894
01:48:40,140 --> 01:48:46,810
如果你不介意我可以叫你...多多
But, if you insist, Toto.

895
01:48:49,220 --> 01:48:51,120
失陪
Excuse me.

896
01:48:55,990 --> 01:48:58,690
谁会相信 小多多!
Who would've believed it...little Toto.

897
01:49:15,330 --> 01:49:19,160
这是他留给你的
This is...what he left for you.

898
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:22,240
他从没有说过要见我?
He never asked to see me?

899
01:49:22,240 --> 01:49:25,360
没有 从来没有
No, never.

900
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:30,540
有一次 你母亲跟他说...
Once your mother said to him...

901
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:33,840
如果他愿意 你肯定会来
that if he wanted it, you'd surely come.

902
01:49:35,450 --> 01:49:38,220
他很生气 他说
He was furious. He said,

903
01:49:38,220 --> 01:49:42,590
不行 多多绝对不能回来!
"No. Toto must never come back to Giancaldo!"

904
01:49:44,990 --> 01:49:50,120
他没有说什么意思 他是个好人
He didn't say it to be mean. He was a good man.

905
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:54,870
谁知道他在想什么
Who knows what was going through his head.

906
01:49:54,870 --> 01:49:59,630
临终前 他说了一些怪事
Towards the end, he said strange things.

907
01:50:01,740 --> 01:50:06,010
就连要闭眼前的那一刻...
A moment before he closed his eyes...

908
01:50:06,010 --> 01:50:10,850
他还告诉你母亲不要让你知道
he told your mother she mustn't let you know.

909
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:22,400
多多 你在想什么?
Toto, What're you thinking?

910
01:54:26,210 --> 01:54:30,670
我一直害怕回来
Just that I've always been afraid to come back.

911
01:54:33,550 --> 01:54:36,710
如今 过去这么多年了
And now, after all these years,

912
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:41,850
我以为我更坚强了 我已经忘掉了很多事情
I thought I was stronger that I'd forgotten a lot of things.

913
01:54:42,290 --> 01:54:47,090
结果我发现我只是回到原点...
But in fact, I find I'm right back where I was...

914
01:54:47,490 --> 01:54:50,220
仿佛从没有离开过
as if I'd never been away.

915
01:54:52,330 --> 01:54:55,270
但我看看四周 却什么都认不出来
Yet when I look around, I don't recognize anyone.

916
01:54:58,910 --> 01:55:04,070
而你 妈妈...我离弃了你
And you, Mama...I deserted you.

917
01:55:05,410 --> 01:55:09,550
我像强盗一样什么都没说就跑开了
Ran out on you like a bandit without any explanation.

918
01:55:09,550 --> 01:55:13,920
我从不要求什么 你也不需要向我解释
I never asked for any. You don't have to explain to me.

919
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:16,180
我一直相信你做的都是对的
I always thought it was good what you did.

920
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:18,450
你何必耿耿于怀
Why harp on it?

921
01:55:19,860 --> 01:55:24,990
你离开是对的 你做了你想做的
You were right to leave. You did what you wanted to do.

922
01:55:27,330 --> 01:55:31,270
我给你打电话时 总有不同的女人回答
When I call you, a different woman always answers.

923
01:55:32,940 --> 01:55:36,910
但是我从没有在她们的声音里听出来...
But I never heard in any of their voices...

924
01:55:36,910 --> 01:55:41,680
她们真的爱你 我也不知道
that they really loved you. I would've known.

925
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:48,090
有时我真想看到你稳定下来...
All the same, I'd have liked to see you settled...

926
01:55:48,090 --> 01:55:51,160
爱一个人
loving someone.

927
01:55:51,160 --> 01:55:56,530
但你生活在罗马 这里太阴沉了
But your life is there. Here there are only ghosts.

928
01:55:56,600 --> 01:55:58,220
忘了她吧 多多
Let go, Toto.

929
01:57:25,770 --> 01:57:29,700
这是我的广场 它是我的
It's my square. It's mine.

930
01:57:59,570 --> 01:58:02,400
检查好了就放
Check the leader. Roll when you're ready.

931
01:58:02,570 --> 01:58:05,970
我喜欢你的电影 非常喜欢
Right. And I liked your film. Terrific.

932
01:58:05,970 --> 01:58:06,870
谢谢
Thanks.
