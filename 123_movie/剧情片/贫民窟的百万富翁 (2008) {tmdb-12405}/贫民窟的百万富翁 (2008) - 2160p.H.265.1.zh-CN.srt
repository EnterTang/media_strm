不用为她担心

341
00:36:37,292 --> 00:36:39,417
她不会有事的

泰姬陵是可兰国王…为他的妻子蒙泰姬而建的
The Taj Mahal was built by Emperor Khurram...for his wife Mumtaz.

386

她是世界上最美的女人
Was the maximum beautiful woman in the world.

387

所以 她去世以后 国王就决定要建造这个…

你说的这些导游手册上都没有的
There's nothing of this in the guidebook.

916
01:34:25,458 --> 01:34:26,500
- 他作弊 -
-- He's a cheat.  

917

 你怎么知道他作弊？
- How do you know he's cheating?

01:34:31,809 --> 01:34:33,347
死鬼乡下佬

你给他答案？
-You gave him an answer? 

920
01:34:39,333 --> 01:34:40,667
确切说也不是

922
01:34:57,958 --> 01:35:02,833
勉强也能说得过去
-It is bizarrely plausible. 

923
01:35:03,083 --> 01:35:08,875
- 但是 - 因为我穷得叮当响 是个茶水工…- 所以我是骗子 对吧？

-win one crore by fair means or foul play? 

933
01:36:11,375 --> 01:36:14,208
对于我周围的民众来说 他们还有一个更大的疑问
-In the crowd around me, there is an even bigger question. 

934
01:36:14,458 --> 01:36:18,750
他今晚是否还会参加节目 来赢取2000万卢比的奖金？

937
01:37:20,292 --> 01:37:24,542
如果说一个选手一路过关斩将…直接杀入最后一关 还不够戏剧化的话
And if there wasn't enough drama in a contestant reaching the fiinal question,

938
01:37:24,792 --> 01:37:29,208
