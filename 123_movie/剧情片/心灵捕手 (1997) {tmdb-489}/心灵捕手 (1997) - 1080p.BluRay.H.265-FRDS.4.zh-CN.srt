1
00:03:34,032 --> 00:03:38,007
Mod f-x-square, d-x.
2
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:43,050
So please finish Percival for next time.
3
00:03:43,058 --> 00:03:46,021
I know many of you had this as undergraduates,
4
00:03:46,021 --> 00:03:48,092
but it won't hurt to brush up.
5
00:03:51,038 --> 00:03:54,059
Thank you, Steven.
6
00:03:54,063 --> 00:03:59,047
I also put an advanced Fourier system on the main hallway chalkboard.
7
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:02,031
I'm hoping that one of you might prove it by the end of the semester.
8
00:04:02,047 --> 00:04:05,039
Now the person to do so will not only be in my good graces...
9
00:04:05,043 --> 00:04:08,056
but also go on to fame and fortune...
10
00:04:08,065 --> 00:04:11,073
by having their accomplishment recorded and their name printed...
11
00:04:11,082 --> 00:04:13,086
in the auspicious M.I.T. Tech.
12
00:04:13,098 --> 00:04:18,045
Former winners include Nobel laureates, Field's medal winners...
13
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:23,024
renowned astrophysicists and lowly M.I.T. professors.
14
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:26,071
Well, that's all. If you have any questions...
15
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,025
I'm sure that Tom has the answers.
16
00:05:06,021 --> 00:05:07,066
Hi, Will.
17
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,075
- Kirsten, how you doing?  - I'm all right. How are you?
18
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:13,000
- Good.  - I didn't get on Cathy last night.
19
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:14,029
- No?  - No.
20
00:05:14,034 --> 00:05:15,084
- Why not?  - I don't know.
21
00:05:15,084 --> 00:05:18,017
- Cathy!  - What?
22
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,072
Why didn't you give me none of that nasty little hoochie-woochie...
23
00:05:20,076 --> 00:05:23,014
- you usually throw at me?  - Oh, fuck you...
24
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:25,060
and your Irish curse, Chuckie.
25
00:05:25,072 --> 00:05:29,060
Like I'd waste my energy spreading my legs for that Tootsie Roll dick?
26
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:33,006
- Go home and give it a tug yourself.  - Tootsie Roll!
27
00:05:33,015 --> 00:05:35,015
T-Toots!
28
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:38,049
She's missing a tooth, Will.
29
00:05:38,053 --> 00:05:41,057
She's got skin problems. I don't...
30
00:05:41,057 --> 00:05:44,066
Plus, it's like 5-to-2 Morgan ends up marrying her, you know what I mean?
31
00:05:44,074 --> 00:05:47,037
There's only so many times you can bang your friend's future wife.
32
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:50,000
It's wrong. Where you going?
33
00:05:50,008 --> 00:05:54,054
- I'm gonna take off.  - Fuck you, you're taking off. It's, like, what, 10:00?
34
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:56,084
No, I'm tired.
35
00:05:59,017 --> 00:06:01,009
Irish curse?
36
00:06:01,022 --> 00:06:04,005
She don't know. There are'nt no Irish curse.
37
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,033
Out! Stop pressuring me back.
38
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:18,054
Stop crowding the plate! Which one will it be?
39
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:23,034
You're gonna get charged, you know that?
40
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,089
You think I'm afraid of you, you big fuck? You're crowding the fucking plate.
41
00:07:26,093 --> 00:07:30,031
Hey, uh, Casey's bouncing up a bar at Harvard next week.
42
00:07:30,031 --> 00:07:31,052
We should go up there.
43
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,081
- What are we gonna do up there?  - I don't know.
44
00:07:33,081 --> 00:07:37,085
We'll fuck up some smart kids. Probably fit right in.
45
00:07:39,073 --> 00:07:42,048
Ow! Fucking punk.
46
00:07:42,048 --> 00:07:46,078
- Oh, what's up? You still tough?  - Come on!
47
00:07:46,086 --> 00:07:48,070
Come on. Come on. That's it.
48
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:01,021
- Professor Lambeau?  - Yes?
49
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,003
I'm in your applied theories class.
50
00:08:03,003 --> 00:08:04,063
We're all up at the math and science building.
51
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:08,097
Come here. It's Saturday.
52
00:08:09,001 --> 00:08:12,043
- Unless you wanna have a drink with me tonight.  - Maybe.
53
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:14,056
We just couldn't wait until Monday to find out.
54
00:08:14,068 --> 00:08:18,031
- Find out what?  - Who proved the theorem.
55
00:08:39,042 --> 00:08:44,017
This is correct. Who did this?
56
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:46,055
- Jack?  - It wasn't me.
57
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:49,034
- Nemesh?  - No way.
58
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,086
Come on, Joey, now!
59
00:08:54,086 --> 00:08:56,022
Billy, McNamara's up.
60
00:08:56,022 --> 00:08:58,069
Come on, kid!
61
00:08:58,073 --> 00:09:00,094
- Joey, dig it out! Dig it out!  - Son of a bitch!
62
00:09:01,002 --> 00:09:02,094
Bring it down, Mac! That's how to do it!
63
00:09:02,094 --> 00:09:04,061
Attaboy! Take two, Mac.
64
00:09:07,044 --> 00:09:12,012
Hey, Morgan, who's the girl with the striped pants? She's got a nice ass.
65
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:15,020
- Yeah, that's a real nice ass.  - Who's the guy she's with?
66
00:09:15,024 --> 00:09:18,054
That fucking guinea. I hate that little bitch. Will knows him.
67
00:09:18,062 --> 00:09:21,021
Yeah, I do. Yeah, fucking Carmine Scarpaglia.
68
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:24,025
- That guy used to beat the shit out of me in kindergarten.  - That guy?
69
00:09:24,034 --> 00:09:26,059
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
70
00:09:26,063 --> 00:09:29,017
Fuck this. Let's get some food.
71
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:33,043
- Oh, what, Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?  - Fuck her.
72
00:09:33,051 --> 00:09:35,093
- I could go for a Whopper.  - Let's go to Kelly's.
73
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:39,006
Morgan, I'm not going to Kelly's just because you like the take-out girl.
74
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,071
It's 15 minutes out of our way.
75
00:09:40,071 --> 00:09:43,044
What the fuck are we gonna do? We can't spare 15 minutes?
76
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,090
Double burger.
77
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,078
Double burger.
78
00:09:49,044 --> 00:09:51,041
Double burger.
79
00:09:51,053 --> 00:09:54,045
Chuck, I had a double burger.
80
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:57,066
Would you shut the fuck up! I know what you ordered. I was there.
81
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,009
So give me my fucking sandwich.
82
00:09:59,009 --> 00:10:00,071
What do you mean, your sandwich? I bought it.
83
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,067
Morgan, how much money you got on you?
84
00:10:02,071 --> 00:10:05,046
I said I'd get change when I get the snow cone.
85
00:10:05,054 --> 00:10:09,001
I said that when we pulled up. Give me my sandwich and stop being a prick.
86
00:10:09,005 --> 00:10:12,018
All right, well, give me your fucking 16 cents that you got on you now.
87
00:10:12,026 --> 00:10:15,057
We'll put your fucking sandwich on layaway.
88
00:10:15,057 --> 00:10:16,068
Here we go. Keep it right up here for ya.
89
00:10:16,072 --> 00:10:19,035
We'll put you on a program. Every day you come in here with your six cents.
90
00:10:19,043 --> 00:10:22,060
- At the end of the week, you get your sandwich.  - Are you gonna be an asshole?
91
00:10:22,064 --> 00:10:25,032
What am I, fucking sandwich welfare?
92
00:10:25,032 --> 00:10:26,094
I think you should establish a good line of credit.
93
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:29,074
Like how you bought your couch... payment plans.
94
00:10:29,082 --> 00:10:33,016
Remember how your mother brought in ten dollars every day for a year.
95
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,012
She finally got her couch Rent-A-Center style.
96
00:10:35,016 --> 00:10:38,041
- Can I have my food, please?  - Here's your fucking double burger.
97
00:10:40,025 --> 00:10:42,066
- Whoa!  - Hey, hold up, Chuck.
98
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:45,013
- Slow it down.  - Who do we got?
99
00:10:45,017 --> 00:10:47,013
- I don't know yet.  - Hey, douche bag!
100
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,067
Yeah, you, you skank face!
101
00:10:49,076 --> 00:10:54,030
- Shut the fuck up.  - Get outta here.  - What are you worried about?
102
00:10:54,034 --> 00:10:56,030
Why don't you lick my love stick?
103
00:10:56,035 --> 00:10:58,055
We seen the guy 15 minutes ago.
104
00:10:58,055 --> 00:11:01,039
We should've fight him then. We're eating our snacks now.
105
00:11:01,052 --> 00:11:02,065
Shut up, Morgan, you're going.
106
00:11:02,065 --> 00:11:03,056
- I'm not going.  - So don't go.
107
00:11:03,056 --> 00:11:07,040
- I'm not going.  - Fucking go, Morgan.
108
00:11:07,048 --> 00:11:09,094
Let me tell you something. If you're not out there in two fucking seconds,
109
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,090
when I'm done with them, you're next.
110
00:11:11,094 --> 00:11:14,074
Carmine, it's me, Will. Remember,
111
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,007
we went to kindergarten together.
112
00:11:30,034 --> 00:11:33,084
- Fucking, let's go, man.  - Step on his fucking head.
113
00:11:33,088 --> 00:11:37,084
Get his ass on the ground. Stop that motherfucker.
114
00:11:44,031 --> 00:11:46,019
Motherfucker, die!
115
00:11:46,023 --> 00:11:49,057
- Carter!  - Come on!
116
00:12:00,028 --> 00:12:04,054
Will! Will, come on!
117
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:08,004
Will, come on. Let's go. Let's go.
118
00:12:09,025 --> 00:12:11,038
Easy, brother, easy.
119
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:14,088
- Hey, fellas, thanks for coming out.  - Come here!
120
00:12:14,097 --> 00:12:16,038
Whoa! Whoa!
121
00:12:22,022 --> 00:12:23,072
Ah. Fuck.
122
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:35,032
Is it just my imagination, or has my class grown considerably?
123
00:12:35,044 --> 00:12:38,045
Well, by no stretch of my imagination...
124
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:41,012
do I believe you've all come here to hear me lecture.
125
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:45,095
Rather, to ascertain the identity of the mystery math magician.
126
00:12:46,008 --> 00:12:51,004
So without further adieu, come forward, silent rogue, and receive thy prize.
127
00:13:01,026 --> 00:13:05,072
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint my spectators, but...
128
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:08,056
it seems there will be no unmasking here today.
129
00:13:08,064 --> 00:13:12,077
However, uh, my colleagues and l have conferred,
130
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:15,044
and there is a problem on the board right now...
131
00:13:15,048 --> 00:13:18,078
that took us more than two years to prove.
132
00:13:18,082 --> 00:13:22,049
So let this be said: The gauntlet has been thrown down,
133
00:13:22,057 --> 00:13:26,062
but the faculty have answered and answered with vigor.
134
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:41,030
Hey, when's the arraignment?
135
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:43,035
Next week.
136
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,096
Sorry.
137
00:14:11,008 --> 00:14:13,004
- What are you doing?  - Sorry.
138
00:14:14,071 --> 00:14:17,005
That's people's work. You can't graffiti here.
139
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:19,084
- Don't you walk away from me!  - Hey, fuck you!
140
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:23,001
Oh, you're a clever one. What's your name?
141
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,037
Oh, my God.
142
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Looks right.
143
00:15:11,048 --> 00:15:14,077
Will, how retarded do you gotta be to get fired from that job?
144
00:15:14,085 --> 00:15:17,056
I mean, how hard is it to push a motherfucking broom around?
145
00:15:17,065 --> 00:15:19,069
Mitch, you got fired from pushing a fucking broom.
146
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:22,011
I got fired because management was restructuring.
147
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:24,091
Yeah, restructuring the amount of retards they had working for them.
148
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:27,028
Shut up. You get canned more than tuna, bitch.
149
00:15:27,032 --> 00:15:30,066
At least I got a motherfucking job right now, don't I?
150
00:15:30,074 --> 00:15:36,038
- Why'd you get fired, Will? Come on.  - Management was restructuring.
151
00:15:36,046 --> 00:15:39,000
- My uncle could probably get you on a demo team.  - Can he do that?
152
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:41,055
You kidding me! I asked you yesterday if I could get a job.
153
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:43,067
And I told you "no" yesterday.
154
00:15:43,072 --> 00:15:44,065
What's up, Casey?
155
00:15:44,065 --> 00:15:46,034
- What's up, Case?  - What's up, Big Case?
156
00:15:49,022 --> 00:15:52,027
Let's sit over here.
157
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:54,031
All right. Let's go.
158
00:15:58,086 --> 00:16:02,048
Oh, this is... this is a Harvard bar, huh?
159
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,095
I thought there'd be, like, equations and shit on the wall.
160
00:16:06,086 --> 00:16:10,062
I will take a pitcher of the finest lager in the house.
161
00:16:17,046 --> 00:16:19,074
Timeout. I'm gonna have to bust a little move on
162
00:16:19,074 --> 00:16:21,075
them Harvard hotties down there at the bar.
163
00:16:21,084 --> 00:16:25,076
- Work some magic.  - Get some potion for us.
164
00:16:40,052 --> 00:16:43,086
- Oh, hello.  - Oh, hello.
165
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,099
- Hi. How are ya?  - Fine.
166
00:16:46,003 --> 00:16:48,007
- So, do you ladies, uh...  - Come here often?
167
00:16:48,011 --> 00:16:50,007
Do I come here? I come here a bit.
168
00:16:50,012 --> 00:16:53,012
I'm here, you know, from time to time.
169
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:55,070
- Do you go to school here?  - Yep.
170
00:16:55,075 --> 00:16:59,017
Yeah, that's it. I think I had a class with you.
171
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:01,000
Oh, yeah. What class?
172
00:17:01,008 --> 00:17:03,005
- History.  - Maybe.
173
00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:05,009
Yes, I think that's what it was.
174
00:17:05,017 --> 00:17:08,076
You don't necessarily... may not remember me. You know, I like it here.
175
00:17:08,084 --> 00:17:12,061
It doesn't mean because I go here, I'm a genius. I am very smart.
176
00:17:12,061 --> 00:17:12,093
Hey.
177
00:17:13,001 --> 00:17:14,085
- Hey, how's it going? How are ya?  - Good. How ya doing?
178
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:17,052
What class did you say that was?
179
00:17:17,052 --> 00:17:19,052
- History.  - Yeah.
180
00:17:19,056 --> 00:17:23,011
Just history? It must have been a survey course then.
181
00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:25,011
- Yeah, it was. It was surveys.  - Right.
182
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:27,049
You should check it out. It's a good course. It'd be a good class.
183
00:17:27,065 --> 00:17:32,020
- How'd you like that course?  - You know, frankly,
184
00:17:32,028 --> 00:17:34,091
- I found that class, you know, rather elementary.  - Elementary.
185
00:17:35,004 --> 00:17:36,095
- You know, I don't doubt that it was.  - Yeah.
186
00:17:37,004 --> 00:17:40,004
I, uh, I remember that class.
187
00:17:40,012 --> 00:17:43,063
It was, um... It was just between recess and lunch.
188
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:46,017
Clark, why don't you go away?
189
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,088
- Why don't you relax?  - Why don't you go away?
190
00:17:48,092 --> 00:17:51,043
- I'm just having fun with my new friend.  - Are we gonna have a problem?
191
00:17:51,055 --> 00:17:54,018
No, no, no, no. There's no problem here.
192
00:17:54,022 --> 00:17:57,072
I was just hoping you might give me some insight into the evolution...
193
00:17:57,081 --> 00:18:00,098
of the market economy in the southern colonies.
194
00:18:01,006 --> 00:18:06,053
My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War, the economic modalities...
195
00:18:06,065 --> 00:18:09,040
especially in the southern colonies...
196
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:12,007
could most aptly be characterized as...
197
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,007
- agrarian precapitalist.  - Let me tell you something.
198
00:18:14,012 --> 00:18:16,045
Of course that's your contention. You're a first-year grad student.
199
00:18:16,058 --> 00:18:18,044
You just got finished reading some Marxian historian...
200
00:18:18,044 --> 00:18:20,062
Pete Garrison, probably...
201
00:18:20,071 --> 00:18:22,087
You're gonna be convinced of that till next month when you get to James Lemon.
202
00:18:22,096 --> 00:18:23,084
Then you're gonna be talking about
203
00:18:23,084 --> 00:18:26,004
how the economies of Virginia and Pennsylvania...
204
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:29,021
were entrepreneurial and capitalist way back in 1740.
205
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,072
That's gonna last until next year.
206
00:18:30,072 --> 00:18:32,072
You're gonna be in here regurgitating Gordon Wood,
207
00:18:32,076 --> 00:18:35,080
talking about, you know, the prerevolutionary utopia...
208
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:38,089
and the capital-forming effects of military mobilization.
209
00:18:39,002 --> 00:18:41,027
Well, as a matter of fact, I won't,
210
00:18:41,035 --> 00:18:44,061
because Wood drastically underestimates the impact of...
211
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:48,011
Wood drastically underestimates the impact of social distinctions...
212
00:18:48,015 --> 00:18:51,045
predicated upon wealth, especially inherited wealth.
213
00:18:51,045 --> 00:18:53,022
You got that from Vickers' Work in
214
00:18:53,022 --> 00:18:55,074
Essex County. Page 98, right?
215
00:18:55,082 --> 00:18:58,037
I read that too. Were you gonna plagiarize the whole thing for us?
216
00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:02,008
Do you have any thoughts of your own on this matter?
217
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:05,029
Or is that your thing? You come into a bar. You read some obscure passage.
218
00:19:05,042 --> 00:19:08,025
Then pretend... pawn it off as your own.
219
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:11,088
As your own idea just to impress some girls? Embarrass my friend?
220
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:15,064
See, the sad thing about a guy like you is, in 50 years,
221
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:17,068
you're gonna start doing some thinking on your own.
222
00:19:17,068 --> 00:19:20,043
You're gonna come up with the fact that there are two certainties in life.
223
00:19:20,052 --> 00:19:22,023
One: Don't do that.
224
00:19:22,031 --> 00:19:25,031
And two: You dropped 150 grand on a fucking education...
225
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,040
you could've got for $1.50 in late charges at the public library.
226
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:33,015
Yeah, but I will have a degree,
227
00:19:33,028 --> 00:19:36,053
and you'll be serving my kids fries at a drive through
228
00:19:36,053 --> 00:19:38,053
on our way to a skiing trip.
229
00:19:38,062 --> 00:19:41,062
Maybe, but at least I won't be unoriginal.
230
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:46,033
If you have a problem with that, we could step outside. We could figure it out.
231
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:50,063
No, man, there's no problem. It's cool.
232
00:19:50,075 --> 00:19:52,063
- It's cool?  - Yeah.
233
00:19:52,071 --> 00:19:55,063
- Cool.  - Damn right, it's cool.
234
00:19:55,063 --> 00:19:58,014
How do you like me now?
235
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,043
My boy's wicked smart.
236
00:20:03,056 --> 00:20:07,040
I just spent three minutes in this fucking place and run into a barney, huh?
237
00:20:09,048 --> 00:20:11,032
There it is.
238
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,036
- Nice to meet you.  - They were fine, man.
239
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,039
I was gonna close the deal, but then Chuck...
240
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:18,028
Billy insulted one of them...
241
00:20:18,037 --> 00:20:20,093
The heavyset girl said I had a receding hairline,
242
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,087
and I was a few pounds overweight.
243
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:23,091
And I was, like, "Go fuck yourself."
244
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,092
I swallowed a bug.
245
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:30,004
Hi.
246
00:20:30,017 --> 00:20:33,009
- You're an idiot.  - What?
247
00:20:33,017 --> 00:20:35,022
You're an idiot. I've been sitting over there for 45 minutes...
248
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,018
waiting for you to come and talk to me.
249
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,089
But I'm tired now, and I have to go home.
250
00:20:39,097 --> 00:20:42,056
I couldn't sit there anymore waiting for you.
251
00:20:42,068 --> 00:20:44,056
- I'm Will.  - Skylar.
252
00:20:44,064 --> 00:20:46,056
- Skylar.  - Oh, and by the way,
253
00:20:46,064 --> 00:20:49,094
that guy over there... Michael Bolton clone...
254
00:20:50,002 --> 00:20:51,098
He wasn't sitting with us, so to speak.
255
00:20:52,011 --> 00:20:55,040
- I know. I kinda got that impression.  - Good. Okay.
256
00:20:55,044 --> 00:20:57,045
Well, I've got to go.
257
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:01,070
Gotta get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
258
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,099
- No, I didn't mean you.  - That's all right.
259
00:21:04,008 --> 00:21:07,066
There's my number. Maybe we can go out for coffee sometime.
260
00:21:07,075 --> 00:21:11,042
All right, yeah. Maybe we can just get together and eat a bunch of caramels.
261
00:21:11,046 --> 00:21:13,046
- What do you mean?  - When you think about it,
262
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:18,038
- it's as arbitrary as drinking coffee.  - Oh. Yeah. Okay.
263
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:21,043
Uh, right, then.
264
00:21:21,055 --> 00:21:25,006
Oh, come on. You're kidding.
265
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,052
Yo!
266
00:21:29,056 --> 00:21:31,048
- Fuck you, bitch!  - Fuck you.
267
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:35,023
- There goes them fucking barneys right now with his skiing trip.  - Hold on.
268
00:21:35,028 --> 00:21:37,078
We should've beat that old bitch's ass.
269
00:21:44,091 --> 00:21:46,095
Do you like apples?
270
00:21:48,029 --> 00:21:50,021
- Yeah.  - Yeah?
271
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:55,042
Well, I got her number! How do you like them apples?
272
00:22:53,052 --> 00:22:57,040
Excuse me? Is this the Buildings and Grounds office?
273
00:22:57,052 --> 00:22:59,082
Yeah. What can I do for you?
274
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,099
I just need the name of a student who works here.
275
00:23:02,003 --> 00:23:04,049
- No students work for me.  - Could you please check?
276
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,074
I have this guy who works in my building.
277
00:23:06,078 --> 00:23:09,020
- He's about this high.  - Which one is your building?
278
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:12,021
- Two.  - Two. Building two.
279
00:23:18,005 --> 00:23:19,082
Look, if anything was stolen, I should know about it.
280
00:23:19,082 --> 00:23:20,038
No, it's nothing like that.
281
00:23:20,042 --> 00:23:22,059
I just need his name.
282
00:23:22,072 --> 00:23:25,035
I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
283
00:23:25,035 --> 00:23:26,060
This is Professor Lambeau.
284
00:23:26,068 --> 00:23:28,068
And this is Professor Hayes.
285
00:23:28,076 --> 00:23:30,072
Tom, please.
286
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:36,094
This is important. Please.
287
00:23:37,006 --> 00:23:39,027
Will didn't show for work today.
288
00:23:39,032 --> 00:23:42,095
Got this job through his P.O. You can call him.
289
00:23:43,007 --> 00:23:47,003
- P.O.?  - Yeah. Parole officer.
290
00:23:51,008 --> 00:23:53,008
Thank you.
291
00:23:54,012 --> 00:23:56,021
Asshole.
292
00:23:58,025 --> 00:24:03,063
There is a lengthy legal precedent, Your Honor, going back to 1789,
293
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:05,026
whereby a defendant can claim self-defense against
294
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,080
an agent of the government...
295
00:24:06,084 --> 00:24:10,026
if that act is deemed a defense against tyranny, a defense of liberty.
296
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:12,047
Your Honor, Henry Ward Beecher,
297
00:24:12,056 --> 00:24:16,031
- in Proverbs from the Plymouth Pulpit, 1887, said, quote...  - 1887?
298
00:24:16,035 --> 00:24:18,019
- Excuse me.  - This is the 20th century.
299
00:24:18,027 --> 00:24:19,079
He's gonna make a mockery.
300
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:22,048
I am afforded the right to speak in my own defense, sir,
301
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:25,024
by the Constitution of the United States.
302
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,028
- Don't tell me about the Constitution.  - This guarantees my liberty.
303
00:24:27,028 --> 00:24:29,078
"Liberty," in case you've forgotten, is a soul's right to breathe.
304
00:24:29,087 --> 00:24:32,037
When it cannot take a long breath, laws are girded too tight.
305
00:24:32,045 --> 00:24:34,066
- Without liberty, man is a syncope.  - Man is a what?
306
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:38,000
- Ibid., Your Honor.  - Son, my turn.
307
00:24:38,008 --> 00:24:42,075
I've been sitting here for ten minutes now looking over this rap sheet of yours.
308
00:24:42,084 --> 00:24:46,084
I just can't believe it. June '93, assault.
309
00:24:46,093 --> 00:24:49,001
September '93, assault.
310
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:52,072
Grand theft auto, February of '94.
311
00:24:52,072 --> 00:24:56,094
Where, apparently, you defended yourself and had the case thrown out by citing...
312
00:24:57,006 --> 00:25:01,027
"free property rights of horse and carriage" from 1798.
313
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:04,090
Joke. January '95, impersonating an officer.
314
00:25:04,094 --> 00:25:08,099
Mayhem, theft, resisting. All overturned.
315
00:25:09,003 --> 00:25:13,004
I'm also aware that you've been through several foster homes.
316
00:25:13,004 --> 00:25:17,004
The state removed you from three because of serious physical abuse.
317
00:25:17,004 --> 00:25:21,050
You know, another judge might care, but you hit a cop. You're going in.
318
00:25:21,054 --> 00:25:25,001
Motion to dismiss is denied. $50,000 bail.
319
00:25:25,005 --> 00:25:26,063
Thank you.
320
00:25:26,076 --> 00:25:28,034
Rise.
321
00:25:30,097 --> 00:25:33,001
- Hello?  - Uh, Skylar?
322
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:35,022
- Yep.  - Hey, uh, it's Will.
323
00:25:35,031 --> 00:25:36,098
- Who?  - It's Will.
324
00:25:37,006 --> 00:25:40,015
You know, the really funny, good-looking guy you met at the bar the other night.
325
00:25:40,023 --> 00:25:42,085
I don't recall meeting anyone who matches
326
00:25:42,085 --> 00:25:43,086
that description. I think I'd remember.
327
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:47,040
Oh, all right, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser...
328
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:49,040
who got hammered and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
329
00:25:49,045 --> 00:25:53,062
Oh, Will! I remember.
330
00:25:53,074 --> 00:25:57,000
How are you? I was wondering if you'd call me.
331
00:25:57,004 --> 00:25:59,000
- Yeah, look, I was wondering...  - Yo, what's up, baby?
332
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,017
- Hold on one second.  - What you doing? Want some of my ass?
333
00:26:03,025 --> 00:26:06,042
Herve, I remember you from juvi. How you doing?
334
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:06,084
What you doing?
335
00:26:06,096 --> 00:26:09,026
Oh, yeah, sorry about that.
336
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:12,009
I was wondering maybe we could get together sometime this week.
337
00:26:12,018 --> 00:26:16,014
- Sit out at a cafe. Maybe have some caramels.  - Oh, that sounds wonderful.
338
00:26:16,022 --> 00:26:18,098
- Yeah?  - Yeah, sure. Where are you?
339
00:26:19,006 --> 00:26:22,006
Uh, well, actually, this is just a shot in the dark,
340
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:26,036
but, uh, there's no chance that you're pre-law, is there?
341
00:26:30,053 --> 00:26:32,053
- Have a seat.  - Thank you.
342
00:26:33,053 --> 00:26:35,049
Nice talking to ya.
343
00:26:38,008 --> 00:26:40,021
What the fuck do you want?
344
00:26:40,025 --> 00:26:43,004
I'm Gerald Lambeau.
345
00:26:43,017 --> 00:26:46,009
Professor you told to fuck himself.
346
00:26:47,025 --> 00:26:50,030
Well, what the fuck do you want?
347
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:51,096
I've spoken to the judge,
348
00:26:51,096 --> 00:26:54,047
and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
349
00:26:54,055 --> 00:26:56,093
- Really?  - Yeah.
350
00:27:02,027 --> 00:27:04,090
- Under two conditions.  - What are those?
351
00:27:05,006 --> 00:27:07,061
First condition is that you meet with me every week.
352
00:27:07,069 --> 00:27:10,099
- What for?  - Go over the proof you're working on,
353
00:27:11,015 --> 00:27:15,087
get into some more advanced...
354
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:18,087
combinatorial mathematics,
355
00:27:18,099 --> 00:27:20,095
finite math.
356
00:27:23,012 --> 00:27:25,004
Sounds like a real hoot.
357
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:29,067
And the second condition is that...
358
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,009
that you see a therapist.
359
00:27:35,089 --> 00:27:39,026
I'm responsible to submit reports on those meetings.
360
00:27:39,031 --> 00:27:44,031
If you fail to meet with any of those conditions, you will have to serve time.
361
00:27:44,044 --> 00:27:46,056
All right. I'll do the math,
362
00:27:46,056 --> 00:27:48,090
but I'm not gonna meet with any fucking therapist.
363
00:27:48,094 --> 00:27:52,090
It's better than spending that time in jail, isn't it?
364
00:28:56,051 --> 00:29:00,072
I read your book, and "Mike" was having the same problems...
365
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,097
that "Chad," the stockbroker, was having.
366
00:29:03,014 --> 00:29:06,014
Absolutely right. Right on the button. Good for you, Will.
367
00:29:06,018 --> 00:29:08,015
- Very nice.  - Thank you.
368
00:29:08,023 --> 00:29:11,015
Will, the pressures... and I'm not judging them.
369
00:29:11,023 --> 00:29:13,098
I'm not labeling them,
370
00:29:14,011 --> 00:29:17,007
but they are destroying your potential.
371
00:29:17,011 --> 00:29:22,012
No more shenanigans. No more tomfoolery. No more ballyhoo.
372
00:29:22,028 --> 00:29:27,012
You're right. God, I know.
373
00:29:27,012 --> 00:29:31,000
You're not gonna get off that easily. Come on, Will. A bit more.
374
00:29:31,004 --> 00:29:34,035
Well, I mean, I do do things, you know?
375
00:29:34,036 --> 00:29:36,013
What... What kind of things?
376
00:29:36,017 --> 00:29:38,084
I do things that, you know, I mean, I hide from people.
377
00:29:38,084 --> 00:29:40,014
You hide, do you?
378
00:29:40,014 --> 00:29:44,026
No, no. I mean, I like... I go places. I interact.
379
00:29:44,031 --> 00:29:46,039
- Really? What sort of places?  - Just certain clubs.
380
00:29:46,048 --> 00:29:48,056
More. That's nice. Yes. What sort of clubs?
381
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:51,002
Like, uh, like Fantasy.
382
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:54,065
Fantasy. That's nice. A bit more.
383
00:29:54,065 --> 00:29:58,032
It's something like when you get in there, the music, like, owns you.
384
00:29:58,036 --> 00:30:00,091
It's like that house music. It's like... Bom, bom, bom
385
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:03,074
Bom-bom-bom Boom, boom, boom, boom
386
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:06,037
- You know, you start dancing.  - Boom, boom, boom. Yeah.
387
00:30:06,037 --> 00:30:08,075
It's just...
388
00:30:08,087 --> 00:30:10,050
Yes.
389
00:30:14,017 --> 00:30:16,063
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
390
00:30:16,076 --> 00:30:19,055
What are you talking about? What?
391
00:30:19,063 --> 00:30:22,047
Look, buddy, two seconds ago, you were ready to give me a jump.
392
00:30:22,051 --> 00:30:26,001
A jump? Are you...
393
00:30:26,006 --> 00:30:28,006
I'm terribly sorry to disappoint you.
394
00:30:28,014 --> 00:30:30,085
Hey, I don't have a problem with it. I don't care if you putt from the rough.
395
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:34,000
What are you... P... Putting from the rough?
396
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,090
What on earth are you talking about?
397
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:40,020
A difficult theorem could be like a symphony.
398
00:30:40,024 --> 00:30:42,086
It's very erotic.
399
00:30:42,099 --> 00:30:45,020
You go somewhere else. I can't handle this.
400
00:30:45,028 --> 00:30:48,066
- Wow.  - Thank you, Henry.
401
00:30:48,075 --> 00:30:51,046
- Ah, Henry.  - Hi, Gerry.
402
00:30:51,054 --> 00:30:53,092
You know something? I can't do this pro bono work anymore.
403
00:30:54,004 --> 00:30:56,055
- It's just not... It's not worth it.  - What happened?
404
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:58,059
Well, I'm going on national television next week.
405
00:30:58,063 --> 00:30:59,093
I mean, I haven't got time to tell you,
406
00:30:59,093 --> 00:31:02,018
much less talk to that raving looney in there.
407
00:31:02,022 --> 00:31:05,014
An absolute lunatic, he is.
408
00:31:05,018 --> 00:31:07,076
Henry.
409
00:31:07,089 --> 00:31:10,052
Okay, you are in your bed, Will.
410
00:31:10,056 --> 00:31:14,023
Now, how old are you?
411
00:31:15,036 --> 00:31:17,032
Seven.
412
00:31:17,036 --> 00:31:19,028
What do you see?
413
00:31:21,011 --> 00:31:23,078
Something's in my room.
414
00:31:23,078 --> 00:31:26,049
What is it?
415
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:31,054
It's like a... It's a figure. It's hovering over me.
416
00:31:31,062 --> 00:31:35,017
You are in a safe place, Will.
417
00:31:35,025 --> 00:31:38,075
It's t... It's touching me.
418
00:31:38,088 --> 00:31:41,080
Where is it touching you?
419
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,034
It's touching me down there,
420
00:31:45,084 --> 00:31:47,093
and I'm nervous.
421
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:51,077
You don't have to be nervous, Will.
422
00:31:51,085 --> 00:31:55,069
We start dancing and dancing.
423
00:31:55,077 --> 00:31:57,065
It's just beautiful,
424
00:31:57,077 --> 00:31:59,065
because we can make...
425
00:31:59,082 --> 00:32:05,020
a lot of love before the sun goes down.
426
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:09,028
Skyrockets in flight
427
00:32:09,037 --> 00:32:12,008
Afternoon delight
428
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:15,062
- Hey, hey, hey, afternoon delight  - Jesus.
429
00:32:15,075 --> 00:32:19,075
Skyrockets in flight Da-da-da-da
430
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,030
- I'm sorry, Rich.  - I have better things to do with my time.
431
00:32:23,034 --> 00:32:26,093
Hey, hey, afternoon delight Come on! One dance!
432
00:32:27,001 --> 00:32:29,085
You really hypnotized me, you know?
433
00:32:29,089 --> 00:32:31,055
For God's sake, Will.
434
00:32:31,055 --> 00:32:33,073
What? Oh, come on. He left. You can't pin that on me.
435
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:37,002
- I told you to cooperate with these people.  - Look...
436
00:32:37,015 --> 00:32:39,052
- into my eyes.  - Get out, Will.
437
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:42,011
I don't need therapy.
438
00:32:42,023 --> 00:32:46,003
That's enough. Get out!
439
00:32:46,015 --> 00:32:50,024
- I called Mel Weintraub this morning to see...  - Oh, what's the use?
440
00:32:50,037 --> 00:32:52,029
What do you want to do?
441
00:32:54,037 --> 00:32:58,092
- Well, there's someone.  - Who is he?
442
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,046
He used to be my, uh... my roommate in college.
443
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:11,093
Trust. Very important in a relationship.
444
00:33:11,097 --> 00:33:13,097
It's also very important in a clinical situation.
445
00:33:14,006 --> 00:33:16,085
Why is trust the most important thing...
446
00:33:16,089 --> 00:33:21,032
in making a breakthrough with a client?
447
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:25,090
Maureen, stop the oral fixation for a moment and join us.
448
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:29,066
- Vinnie.  - Um...
449
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:32,066
Because, uh...
450
00:33:32,074 --> 00:33:35,070
Trust is, uh... Trust is life.
451
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:39,042
Wow. That's very deep. Thank you, Vinnie.
452
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:42,025
Next time, get the notes from your brother.
453
00:33:42,025 --> 00:33:44,022
If a patient doesn't feel safe enough trust you,
454
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,076
then they won't be honest with you.
455
00:33:45,076 --> 00:33:47,093
Then there's really no point for them being in therapy.
456
00:33:48,001 --> 00:33:50,079
I mean, hey, if they don't trust you,
457
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:52,010
you're never gonna get them to sleep with you.
458
00:33:52,018 --> 00:33:54,028
That should be the goal of any good therapist.
459
00:33:54,028 --> 00:33:55,018
Nail them while they're vulnerable.
460
00:33:55,027 --> 00:33:56,093
That's my motto.
461
00:33:56,098 --> 00:33:59,056
Oh, good, everyone's back. Welcome back, everybody.
462
00:34:00,098 --> 00:34:04,069
- Hello, Sean.  - Hey, Gerry.
463
00:34:06,078 --> 00:34:11,099
Um, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the presence of greatness.
464
00:34:12,003 --> 00:34:16,004
Professor Gerald Lambeau, Fields medal winner for combinatorial mathematics.
465
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,091
- Hello.  - Anyone know what the Field's medal is?
466
00:34:18,096 --> 00:34:21,075
It's a really big deal. It's like the Nobel prize for math.
467
00:34:21,088 --> 00:34:26,092
Except they only give it out once every four years. It's a great thing.
468
00:34:26,096 --> 00:34:30,005
It's an amazing honor. Okay, everybody, that's it for today.
469
00:34:30,009 --> 00:34:33,055
Thanks. We'll see you Monday. We'll be talking about Freud.
470
00:34:33,064 --> 00:34:36,093
Why he did enough cocaine to kill a small horse. Thank you.
471
00:34:38,081 --> 00:34:41,044
- How are you?  - It's good to see you.
472
00:34:41,056 --> 00:34:43,048
Good to see you.
473
00:34:43,052 --> 00:34:47,015
- Sean, I think I got something interesting for ya.  - Yeah?
474
00:34:47,028 --> 00:34:49,070
What, you have to have blood and urine? What's up?
475
00:34:49,078 --> 00:34:52,011
Why didn't you come to the reunion?
476
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:55,066
You know, I'm... I've been busy.
477
00:34:55,078 --> 00:34:57,066
- You were missed.  - Really?
478
00:34:57,074 --> 00:35:02,008
- So how long has it been since we've seen each other?  - Before Nancy died.
479
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:04,004
Yeah, I'm sorry.
480
00:35:04,017 --> 00:35:06,080
I was in Paris. It was that damn conference.
481
00:35:06,092 --> 00:35:08,055
I got your card. It was nice.
482
00:35:14,005 --> 00:35:15,089
- Come here.  - Now that's a takedown.
483
00:35:16,001 --> 00:35:19,093
Hey, what happened? Did you get leniency or what?
484
00:35:19,098 --> 00:35:24,069
I got, uh, probation and then counseling two days a week.
485
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:26,095
Joke. You're a smoothie.
486
00:35:26,095 --> 00:35:28,048
Come on, Morgan! Just submit!
487
00:35:30,082 --> 00:35:32,070
Hey, Bill, just... just get off him. We're gonna miss the game.
488
00:35:32,082 --> 00:35:34,078
- I've got a full schedule. I'm very busy.  - Sean, Sean.
489
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:37,091
This... This boy is incredible. I've never seen anything like him.
490
00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:41,037
What makes him so incredible, Gerry?
491
00:35:41,037 --> 00:35:45,046
- You ever heard of Ramanujan?  - Yeah, yeah. No.
492
00:35:45,058 --> 00:35:50,038
It's a man. He lived over 100 years ago. He was Indian.
493
00:35:50,042 --> 00:35:53,026
- Dots, not feathers.  - Not feathers. Yeah.
494
00:35:53,038 --> 00:35:55,030
He lived in this tiny hut somewhere in India.
495
00:35:55,034 --> 00:35:57,076
He had no formal education.
496
00:35:57,085 --> 00:36:00,035
- He had no access to any scientific work.  - Coffee?
497
00:36:00,043 --> 00:36:02,073
- You, sir?  - Just a little.
498
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:05,015
But he came across this old math book,
499
00:36:05,027 --> 00:36:07,086
and from the simple text, he was able to extrapolate theories...
500
00:36:07,086 --> 00:36:09,082
that had baffled mathematicians for years.
501
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:13,003
Yes. Continued fractions. He wrote, uh...
502
00:36:13,007 --> 00:36:17,020
- Well, he mailed it to Hardy at Cambridge.  - Yeah, Cambridge. Yeah.
503
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:20,054
- And Hardy immediately recognized the brilliance of his work...  - Mm-hmm.
504
00:36:20,062 --> 00:36:24,021
and brought him over to England, and then they worked together for years,
505
00:36:24,029 --> 00:36:26,079
creating some of the most exciting math theory ever done.
506
00:36:26,092 --> 00:36:29,021
This... This Ramanujan...
507
00:36:29,025 --> 00:36:33,026
his... his genius was unparalleled, Sean.
508
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:36,076
- Well, this boy's just like that.  - Hmm.
509
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:40,039
- But he's... he's a bit defensive.  - Hmm.
510
00:36:40,043 --> 00:36:42,047
I need someone who can get through to him.
511
00:36:42,047 --> 00:36:46,006
- Like me?  - Yeah, like you.
512
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:49,023
- Why?  - Well, because you have the same kind of background.
513
00:36:49,031 --> 00:36:52,057
- What background?  - Well, you're from the same neighborhood.
514
00:36:52,061 --> 00:36:55,095
- He's from Southie?  - Yeah.
515
00:36:56,003 --> 00:36:58,082
Boy genius from Southie.
516
00:36:58,095 --> 00:37:03,004
- How many shrinks you go to before me?  - Five.
517
00:37:03,016 --> 00:37:07,058
- Let me guess. Barry? Henry? Not Rick?  - Yeah. Yeah.
518
00:37:07,062 --> 00:37:10,079
- Sean, please, just meet with him once a week.  - Mm-hmm.
519
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,075
Please?
520
00:37:15,084 --> 00:37:19,001
It's a poker game with this kid. Don't let him know what you've got.
521
00:37:19,014 --> 00:37:22,014
He probably even read your book, if he could find it.
522
00:37:22,026 --> 00:37:24,064
It's gonna be hard for him to find.
523
00:37:24,068 --> 00:37:26,014
- Hi, Will.  - Hi.
524
00:37:26,027 --> 00:37:28,019
This is Sean Maguire. Will Hunting.
525
00:37:28,023 --> 00:37:30,015
How are ya?
526
00:37:34,061 --> 00:37:36,057
- Yeah. Let's get started.  - Yeah, let's do it.
527
00:37:36,057 --> 00:37:38,070
I'm pumped. Let's let the healing begin.
528
00:37:38,078 --> 00:37:42,024
- Will you excuse us?  - Yeah, please, Tom.
529
00:37:42,037 --> 00:37:44,095
You, too, Gerry.
530
00:37:45,004 --> 00:37:46,096
Yeah, of course.
531
00:37:52,038 --> 00:37:54,030
How are you?
532
00:37:56,034 --> 00:37:58,068
Where you from in Southie?
533
00:37:58,084 --> 00:38:01,064
- I like what you've done with the place.  - Oh, thanks.
534
00:38:01,076 --> 00:38:03,093
Do you buy all these books retail,
535
00:38:04,001 --> 00:38:06,005
or do you send away for, like, a "shrink kit"
536
00:38:06,005 --> 00:38:08,010
that comes with all these volumes included?
537
00:38:08,023 --> 00:38:11,081
- Do you like books?  - Yeah.
538
00:38:11,086 --> 00:38:14,002
- Did you read any of these books?  - I don't know.
539
00:38:14,011 --> 00:38:16,082
- How about any of these books?  - Probably not.
540
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:20,061
What about the ones on the top shelf? You read those?
541
00:38:20,066 --> 00:38:24,062
- Yeah, I read those.  - Good for you. What do you think about them?
542
00:38:24,066 --> 00:38:26,021
I'm not here for a fucking book report.
543
00:38:26,021 --> 00:38:27,054
They're your books. Why don't you read them?
544
00:38:27,058 --> 00:38:29,046
I did. I had to.
545
00:38:29,046 --> 00:38:32,096
- Must've taken you a long time.  - Yeah, it did.
546
00:38:39,063 --> 00:38:44,056
United States of America: A Complete History, Volume l.
547
00:38:54,086 --> 00:38:58,049
Jesus. If you wanna read a real history book,
548
00:38:58,061 --> 00:39:00,053
read Howard Zinn's A People's History in the United States.
549
00:39:00,061 --> 00:39:02,049
That book'll fucking knock you on your ass.
550
00:39:02,061 --> 00:39:04,058
Better than Chomsky's Manufacturing Consent?
551
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:09,050
- Do you think that's a good book?  - You fucking people baffle me.
552
00:39:09,054 --> 00:39:12,076
You spend all your money on these fucking fancy books.
553
00:39:12,076 --> 00:39:14,017
You surround yourselves with them.
554
00:39:14,029 --> 00:39:16,071
- They're the wrong fucking books.  - What are the right fucking books, Will?
555
00:39:16,075 --> 00:39:21,009
- Whatever blows your hair back.  - Yeah. Haven't got much hair left.
556
00:39:21,017 --> 00:39:23,080
Hey, you know you'd be better shoving that cigarette up your ass.
557
00:39:23,084 --> 00:39:25,097
- It'd probably be healthier for you.  - Yeah, I know.
558
00:39:26,001 --> 00:39:29,047
- It really gets in the way of my yoga.  - You work out, huh?
559
00:39:29,047 --> 00:39:32,052
- What, you lift?  - Yeah.
560
00:39:32,052 --> 00:39:35,002
- Nautilus?  - No, free weights.
561
00:39:35,015 --> 00:39:36,057
- Oh, really? Free weights, huh?  - Yeah. Yeah, big time.
562
00:39:36,061 --> 00:39:37,086
- Yeah?  - Just like that.
563
00:39:37,086 --> 00:39:42,070
- What do you bench?  - 285. What do you bench?
564
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:44,095
You paint that?
565
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:46,091
- Yeah. Do you paint?  - Uh-uh.
566
00:39:47,003 --> 00:39:50,054
- Do you sculpt?  - No.
567
00:39:50,062 --> 00:39:52,083
Do you like art?
568
00:39:52,096 --> 00:39:57,029
- Do you like music?  - This is a real piece of shit.
569
00:39:57,038 --> 00:39:59,030
Oh, tell me what you really think.
570
00:39:59,038 --> 00:40:05,001
Just the linear and impressionistic mix makes a very muddled composition.
571
00:40:05,009 --> 00:40:09,031
It's also a Winslow Homer rip-off, except you got whitey rowing the boat there.
572
00:40:09,043 --> 00:40:11,027
Well, it's art, Monet. It wasn't very good.
573
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,081
- That's not really what concerns me though.  - What concerns you?
574
00:40:13,094 --> 00:40:16,036
- Just the coloring.  - You know what the real bitch of it is?
575
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,052
It's paint-by-number.
576
00:40:18,057 --> 00:40:21,007
Is it color-by-number? Because the colors are fascinating to me.
577
00:40:21,011 --> 00:40:22,061
- Aren't they really?  - You bet.
578
00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:26,037
I think you're about one step away from cutting your fucking ear off.
579
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:27,099
- Really?  - Oh, yeah.
580
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:31,075
Think I should move to the south of France, change my name to "Vincent"?
581
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:35,017
- You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm"?  - Yeah.
582
00:40:35,025 --> 00:40:38,021
- Yeah, maybe that means you.  - In what way?
583
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:41,019
Maybe you're in the middle of a storm, a big fucking storm.
584
00:40:41,019 --> 00:40:41,076
Yeah, maybe.
585
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,097
The sky's falling on your head. The waves are crashing over your little boat.
586
00:40:45,001 --> 00:40:47,009
The oars are about to snap.
587
00:40:47,022 --> 00:40:49,018
You just piss in your pants. You're crying for the harbor.
588
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,052
So maybe you do what you gotta do to get out.
589
00:40:51,064 --> 00:40:53,098
You know, maybe you became a psychologist.
590
00:40:53,098 --> 00:40:57,052
Bingo. That's it. Let me do my job now. You start with me. Come on.
591
00:40:59,094 --> 00:41:05,032
- Maybe you married the wrong woman.  - Maybe you should watch your mouth!
592
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,028
Watch it right there, chief, all right?
593
00:41:10,016 --> 00:41:12,012
Ah.
594
00:41:15,096 --> 00:41:18,050
That's it, isn't it?
595
00:41:18,054 --> 00:41:22,013
You married the wrong woman.
596
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:26,076
What happened? What, did she leave you?
597
00:41:26,088 --> 00:41:29,089
Was she, you know... banging some other guy?
598
00:41:31,093 --> 00:41:34,073
If you ever disrespect my wife again, I will end you.
599
00:41:34,073 --> 00:41:36,081
I will fucking end you.
600
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:40,036
Got that, chief?
601
00:41:40,048 --> 00:41:42,040
Time's up.
602
00:41:42,052 --> 00:41:44,086
Yeah.
603
00:41:58,022 --> 00:42:00,018
At ease, gentlemen.
604
00:42:06,031 --> 00:42:08,019
You okay?
605
00:42:13,053 --> 00:42:17,061
Look, I'll understand if you don't wanna meet with him again.
606
00:42:17,065 --> 00:42:21,041
Thursday, 4:00. Make sure the kid's here.
607
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,066
Yeah.
608
00:42:25,066 --> 00:42:27,066
Thanks.
609
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:34,094
Well, you look lovely in those glasses.
610
00:43:35,002 --> 00:43:36,098
- Thank you very much.  - They're just beautiful.
611
00:43:36,098 --> 00:43:40,095
- Yes, I always wanted dark blue eye shadow.  - Wonderful.
612
00:43:43,057 --> 00:43:47,004
Growing up in England, you know, I went to a very nice school.
613
00:43:47,008 --> 00:43:50,004
You know, it was kind of progressive, organic,
614
00:43:50,004 --> 00:43:52,033
do-it-yourself, private school.
615
00:43:52,042 --> 00:43:56,088
Then Harvard. Hopefully med school.
616
00:43:56,096 --> 00:43:58,092
You know, I figured out, by the end,
617
00:43:58,096 --> 00:44:03,026
my braings gonna be worth $250,000.
618
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:06,085
That sounded horrible, didn't it?
619
00:44:06,093 --> 00:44:09,064
Bring me another mai tai!
620
00:44:09,068 --> 00:44:13,085
Yeah, that's cool. I mean, I bet your parents were happy to pay.
621
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:17,086
No, I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
622
00:44:17,094 --> 00:44:21,036
Wow. Is Harvard getting all that money?
623
00:44:21,045 --> 00:44:24,041
No, Stanford. I'm going there in June when I graduate.
624
00:44:24,057 --> 00:44:29,058
All right, so you just wanted to use this sailor and then run away, huh?
625
00:44:29,062 --> 00:44:32,092
I was gonna, you know, experiment on you for anatomy class first, obviously.
626
00:44:32,096 --> 00:44:35,025
In that case, that's fine.
627
00:44:35,029 --> 00:44:38,013
- Hey, you wanna see my magic tricks, Skylar?  - Of course.
628
00:44:38,013 --> 00:44:41,034
All right. Promise to...
629
00:44:41,038 --> 00:44:43,072
All right.
630
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,068
This one's for you, Rudolph.
631
00:44:45,068 --> 00:44:47,043
Wait, wait. You need my wand.
632
00:44:47,055 --> 00:44:50,039
All right, give me a hit. Thank you. All right.
633
00:44:50,043 --> 00:44:52,039
I'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.
634
00:44:52,048 --> 00:44:55,027
You ready? Ready.
635
00:44:55,031 --> 00:44:57,094
One, two, three.
636
00:44:57,098 --> 00:45:00,098
They're all gone.
637
00:45:01,007 --> 00:45:03,061
That was my... It works better when I have my rabbit.
638
00:45:03,082 --> 00:45:06,066
Well...
639
00:45:06,074 --> 00:45:09,037
I don't really date, you know, that much.
640
00:45:09,049 --> 00:45:14,037
How very unfortunate... I think for me.
641
00:45:14,046 --> 00:45:17,079
You know what I mean? I know you've been thinking about it.
642
00:45:17,084 --> 00:45:19,080
- Oh, no, I haven't.  - Yes, you have.
643
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,079
No, I really haven't.
644
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,051
Yes, you have. You were hoping to get a good night kiss.
645
00:45:22,059 --> 00:45:25,068
No, you know, I tell ya, I was hoping to get a good night laid.
646
00:45:28,022 --> 00:45:30,068
But I'll settle for, like, a kiss, you know?
647
00:45:30,081 --> 00:45:33,056
- How very noble of you.  - Thank you.
648
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:37,015
- Mm.  - No, I was... I was hoping for a kiss.
649
00:45:38,044 --> 00:45:42,061
Well, why don't we just get it out of the way now?
650
00:45:42,074 --> 00:45:45,015
- Right now?  - Yeah.
651
00:45:45,028 --> 00:45:47,016
Come on.
652
00:45:55,046 --> 00:45:58,050
I think I got some of your pickle.
653
00:46:09,001 --> 00:46:11,047
You again, huh?
654
00:46:13,035 --> 00:46:15,060
Come with me.
655
00:46:21,052 --> 00:46:26,095
So what's this? A Taster's Choice moment between guys?
656
00:46:27,007 --> 00:46:31,066
This is really nice. You got a thing for swans? Is this, like, a fetish?
657
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:33,099
Is it something, like, maybe we need to devote some time to?
658
00:46:35,091 --> 00:46:41,029
- Thought about what you said to me the other day. About my painting.  - Oh.
659
00:46:41,034 --> 00:46:44,030
Stayed up half the night thinking about it.
660
00:46:45,046 --> 00:46:47,067
Something occurred to me.
661
00:46:47,067 --> 00:46:52,026
I fell into a deep, peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since.
662
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:55,031
- You know what occurred to me?  - No.
663
00:46:55,043 --> 00:46:59,085
You're just a kid. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
664
00:46:59,094 --> 00:47:03,007
- Why, thank you.  - It's all right.
665
00:47:03,015 --> 00:47:05,057
You've never been out of Boston.
666
00:47:07,078 --> 00:47:09,070
Nope.
667
00:47:09,074 --> 00:47:11,091
So if I asked you about art, you'd probably give me the skinny...
668
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:14,058
on every art book ever written.
669
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:18,041
Michelangelo? You know a lot about him.
670
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:22,013
Life's work, political aspirations. Him and the pope.
671
00:47:22,029 --> 00:47:25,089
Sexual orientation. The whole works, right?
672
00:47:27,009 --> 00:47:31,051
I bet you can't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel.
673
00:47:33,022 --> 00:47:37,077
You never actually stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling.
674
00:47:40,035 --> 00:47:42,090
Seeing that.
675
00:47:42,094 --> 00:47:44,090
If I ask you about women,
676
00:47:44,098 --> 00:47:48,065
you'll probably give me a syllabus of your personal favorites.
677
00:47:48,078 --> 00:47:51,061
You may have even been laid a few times.
678
00:47:56,070 --> 00:48:00,000
But you can't tell me what it feels like to wake up next to a woman...
679
00:48:00,004 --> 00:48:02,050
and feel truly happy.
680
00:48:05,063 --> 00:48:07,059
You're a tough kid.
681
00:48:09,038 --> 00:48:13,022
I ask you about war, you'd probably throw Shakespeare at me, right?
682
00:48:13,026 --> 00:48:16,072
"Once more into the breach, dear friends."
683
00:48:18,002 --> 00:48:21,006
But you've never been near one.
684
00:48:21,014 --> 00:48:23,094
You've never held your best friend's head in your lap...
685
00:48:23,098 --> 00:48:28,036
and watch him gasp his last breath looking to you for help.
686
00:48:30,028 --> 00:48:35,049
If I asked you about love, you'd probably quote me a sonnet,
687
00:48:35,053 --> 00:48:39,070
but you've never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable.
688
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:44,012
Known someone that could level you with her eyes.
689
00:48:44,017 --> 00:48:48,063
Feeling like God put an angel on Earth just for you,
690
00:48:48,071 --> 00:48:51,063
who could rescue you from the depths of hell.
691
00:48:51,076 --> 00:48:54,097
And you wouldn't know what it's like to be her angel,
692
00:48:55,001 --> 00:48:58,010
to have that love for her be there forever.
693
00:48:58,014 --> 00:49:02,064
Through anything. Through cancer.
694
00:49:02,077 --> 00:49:04,098
And you wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room...
695
00:49:05,006 --> 00:49:07,019
for two months, holding her hand,
696
00:49:07,019 --> 00:49:09,015
because the doctors could see in your eyes...
697
00:49:09,023 --> 00:49:13,082
that the terms "visiting hours" don't apply to you.
698
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:16,012
You don't know about real loss,
699
00:49:16,016 --> 00:49:21,020
because that only occurs when you love something more than you love yourself.
700
00:49:21,025 --> 00:49:25,021
I doubt you've ever dared to love anybody that much.
701
00:49:27,054 --> 00:49:32,051
I look at you. I don't see an intelligent, confident man.
702
00:49:34,084 --> 00:49:38,026
I see a cocky, scared shitless kid.
703
00:49:40,001 --> 00:49:43,031
But you're a genius, Will. No one denies that.
704
00:49:43,048 --> 00:49:46,098
No one could possibly understand the depths of you.
705
00:49:47,006 --> 00:49:50,019
But you presume to know everything about me because you saw a painting of mine.
706
00:49:50,023 --> 00:49:53,011
You ripped my fucking life apart.
707
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:59,012
You're an orphan, right?
708
00:50:02,095 --> 00:50:06,096
Do you think I'd know the first thing about how hard your life has been...
709
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,063
how you feel, who you are...
710
00:50:09,071 --> 00:50:13,009
because I read Oliver Twist?
711
00:50:13,017 --> 00:50:15,038
Does that encapsulate you?
712
00:50:17,076 --> 00:50:20,076
Personally, I don't give a shit about all that, because...
713
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,097
You know what? I can't learn anything from you...
714
00:50:23,006 --> 00:50:25,043
I can't read in some fucking book.
715
00:50:27,031 --> 00:50:29,040
Unless you wanna talk about you,
716
00:50:29,044 --> 00:50:31,040
who you are.
717
00:50:32,094 --> 00:50:36,078
And I'm fascinated. I'm in.
718
00:50:38,091 --> 00:50:41,083
But you don't wanna do that, do you, sport?
719
00:50:44,016 --> 00:50:47,012
You're terrified of what you might say.
720
00:50:52,017 --> 00:50:54,009
Your move, chief.
721
00:52:01,074 --> 00:52:04,003
Hello? Hello?
722
00:52:04,007 --> 00:52:06,099
Hello?
723
00:52:07,008 --> 00:52:09,096
Professor Valenti, are you calling me again?
724
00:52:12,088 --> 00:52:14,079
Freak.
725
00:52:18,067 --> 00:52:21,026
- Oh, God.  - Christ, who did you call?
726
00:52:21,034 --> 00:52:23,089
- No one. I forgot the number.  - You fucking retarded?
727
00:52:23,093 --> 00:52:26,047
You went all the way out there in the rain, and you didn't bring the number.
728
00:52:26,051 --> 00:52:30,048
No, it was your mother's 900 number. I just ran out of quarters.
729
00:52:30,052 --> 00:52:33,010
Why don't we get off on mothers? I just got off yours.
730
00:52:33,019 --> 00:52:35,031
That's pretty funny, Morgan.
731
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,082
That's a fucking nickel, bitch.
732
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:40,024
- Keep antagonizing me. Watch what happens.  - All right, then, Morgan.
733
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:42,015
- Watch what happens.  - All right, then, Morgan.
734
00:52:42,024 --> 00:52:44,037
Keep fucking with me.
735
00:52:50,037 --> 00:52:52,025
No smoking.
736
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:26,087
What do you mean, he didn't talk? You were in there for an hour.
737
00:53:26,091 --> 00:53:30,016
He just sat there counting the seconds until the session was over.
738
00:53:30,024 --> 00:53:32,096
- Pretty impressive, actually.  - Why would he do that?
739
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,004
To prove to me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
740
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:39,029
What is this? Some kind of staring contest
741
00:53:39,029 --> 00:53:41,009
between two kids from the old neighborhood?
742
00:53:41,013 --> 00:53:44,093
Yeah, it is, and I can't talk first.
743
00:53:44,097 --> 00:53:47,082
We know your theory, Alexander,
744
00:53:47,082 --> 00:53:49,097
but the boy's found a simple geometrical picture.
745
00:53:50,001 --> 00:53:53,010
- A tree structure won't work.  - Look now. He's joining the two vertices.
746
00:53:53,014 --> 00:53:55,060
But I can do the sum.
747
00:53:55,073 --> 00:53:58,019
- It's how you group the terms, Alexander.  - But, Gerry.
748
00:53:58,019 --> 00:54:00,023
If we do the whole thing this way, then...
749
00:54:00,027 --> 00:54:03,003
Hey, look, look.
750
00:54:03,015 --> 00:54:06,053
I wrote it down. It's simpler this way.
751
00:54:17,008 --> 00:54:20,004
Sometimes people get lucky.
752
00:54:20,009 --> 00:54:22,005
You're a brilliant man.
753
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:01,096
You know, I was on this plane once,
754
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,084
and I'm sitting there, and...
755
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:06,084
the captain gets on, he does his whole, you know,
756
00:55:06,092 --> 00:55:09,051
"we'll be cruising at 35,000 feet," but then he puts the mike down.
757
00:55:09,051 --> 00:55:12,026
- He forgets to turn it off.  - Mm-hmm.
758
00:55:12,039 --> 00:55:14,026
So he turns to the copilot. He's, like,
759
00:55:14,035 --> 00:55:19,006
"You know, all I could use right now is a fucking blow job and a cup of coffee."
760
00:55:19,014 --> 00:55:21,069
So the stewardess fucking goes bombing up from the back of the plane...
761
00:55:21,077 --> 00:55:23,044
to tell him the microphone's still on.
762
00:55:23,057 --> 00:55:26,086
This guy in the back of the plane's like, "Hey, hon, don't forget the coffee."
763
00:55:26,086 --> 00:55:30,041
You ever been on a plane?
764
00:55:30,049 --> 00:55:32,020
No, but it's a fucking joke.
765
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:33,049
It works better if I tell it in the first person.
766
00:55:33,053 --> 00:55:35,049
Yeah, it does.
767
00:55:38,062 --> 00:55:40,050
I have been laid, you know?
768
00:55:40,062 --> 00:55:42,088
Really? Good for you.
769
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,088
- Big time, big time.  - Big time, huh?
770
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,013
I went on a date last week.
771
00:55:48,013 --> 00:55:51,022
- How'd it go?  - It was good.
772
00:55:51,026 --> 00:55:53,022
- Going out again?  - I don't know.
773
00:55:53,022 --> 00:55:54,097
- Why?  - Haven't called her.
774
00:55:55,001 --> 00:55:58,035
- Christ, you're an amateur.  - I know what I'm doing.
775
00:55:58,035 --> 00:56:02,069
Yeah. Don't worry about me. I know what I'm doing.
776
00:56:02,073 --> 00:56:05,027
Yeah, but this girl was, like, you know, beautiful.
777
00:56:05,032 --> 00:56:09,070
She's smart. She's fun. She's different from most of the girls I've been with.
778
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:11,060
So call her up, Romeo.
779
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:13,062
Why, so I can realize she's not that smart.
780
00:56:13,066 --> 00:56:15,099
That she's fucking boring? You know, I mean, you don't...
781
00:56:16,008 --> 00:56:19,058
This girl's, like, fucking perfect right now. I don't wanna ruin that.
782
00:56:19,062 --> 00:56:23,050
Maybe you're perfect right now. Maybe you don't wanna ruin that.
783
00:56:25,021 --> 00:56:27,055
But I think that's a super philosophy, Will.
784
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:29,039
That way, you can go
785
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:33,047
through your entire life without ever having to really know anybody.
786
00:56:35,076 --> 00:56:37,072
My wife used to fart when she was nervous.
787
00:56:37,077 --> 00:56:40,081
She had all sorts of wonderful idiosyncrasies.
788
00:56:40,089 --> 00:56:43,044
You know, she used to fart in her sleep.
789
00:56:43,056 --> 00:56:46,044
Just thought I'd share that with you.
790
00:56:46,044 --> 00:56:49,011
One night it was so loud, it woke the dog up.
791
00:56:52,086 --> 00:56:54,082
She woke up and gone, like, "Was that you?"
792
00:56:54,091 --> 00:56:58,008
I said, "Yeah." I didn't have the heart to tell her. Oh, God.
793
00:56:58,016 --> 00:57:00,045
- She woke herself up?  - Yes.
794
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:08,064
Oh, Christ. But, Will, she's been dead two years
795
00:57:08,064 --> 00:57:10,071
and that's the shit I remember.
796
00:57:10,076 --> 00:57:13,093
It's wonderful stuff, you know? Little things like that.
797
00:57:14,005 --> 00:57:18,001
Yeah, but those are the things I miss the most.
798
00:57:18,006 --> 00:57:21,002
Those little idiosyncrasies that only I knew about.
799
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:23,069
That's what made her my wife.
800
00:57:23,077 --> 00:57:27,015
Boy, and she had the goods on me too. She knew all my little peccadillos.
801
00:57:27,015 --> 00:57:31,065
People call these things "imperfections," but they're not.
802
00:57:31,074 --> 00:57:34,049
That's the good stuff.
803
00:57:34,053 --> 00:57:39,020
And then we get to choose who we let into our weird little worlds.
804
00:57:39,028 --> 00:57:41,020
You're not perfect, sport.
805
00:57:41,029 --> 00:57:43,096
And let me save you the suspense.
806
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,029
This girl you met, she isn't perfect either.
807
00:57:47,033 --> 00:57:51,026
But the question is whether or not you're perfect for each other.
808
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:55,063
That's the whole deal. That's what intimacy is all about.
809
00:57:55,068 --> 00:57:57,064
Now you can know everything in the world, sport,
810
00:57:57,072 --> 00:58:00,081
but the only way you're finding out that one is by giving it a shot.
811
00:58:00,081 --> 00:58:03,060
You certainly won't learn from an old fucker like me.
812
00:58:03,064 --> 00:58:07,031
Even if I did know, I wouldn't tell a pissant like you.
813
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,036
Yeah, why not?
814
00:58:09,048 --> 00:58:13,019
You told me every other fucking thing. Jesus Christ.
815
00:58:13,024 --> 00:58:16,003
Fucking talk more than any shrink I ever seen in my life.
816
00:58:16,003 --> 00:58:20,016
I teach the shit. I didn't say I knew how to do it.
817
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:22,012
Yeah.
818
00:58:25,021 --> 00:58:27,096
You ever think about getting remarried?
819
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,054
My wife's dead.
820
00:58:30,063 --> 00:58:33,076
- Hence the word "remarried."  - She's dead.
821
00:58:36,038 --> 00:58:39,068
Yeah, well, I think that's a super philosophy, Sean.
822
00:58:39,072 --> 00:58:41,089
I mean, that way, you can actually go through the rest of your life...
823
00:58:41,097 --> 00:58:44,060
without ever really knowing anybody.
824
00:58:47,006 --> 00:58:49,023
Time's up.
825
00:59:03,066 --> 00:59:05,091
- Hold it open.  - Okay.
826
00:59:05,095 --> 00:59:07,045
Thanks.
827
00:59:36,019 --> 00:59:39,053
"G" minor seventh. Saddest of all chords.
828
00:59:40,086 --> 00:59:42,078
- Hello.  - Hey.
829
00:59:42,083 --> 00:59:45,027
Where have you been?
830
00:59:45,027 --> 00:59:47,016
I'm sorry. I've been, like... I've been really busy, and...
831
00:59:47,029 --> 00:59:49,079
- But, um...  - Mmm. Me too.
832
00:59:49,096 --> 00:59:55,009
Yeah. I... I thought you'd call.
833
00:59:55,013 --> 00:59:57,034
Yeah, um...
834
00:59:57,038 --> 01:00:00,068
- I mean, we had a really good time.  - I had a really good time too.
835
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,097
I mean, I just... I...
836
01:00:03,001 --> 01:00:05,018
I'm sorry, you know. I blew it.
837
01:00:05,026 --> 01:00:07,043
No. No, I mean, you know, it's all right.
838
01:00:07,052 --> 01:00:10,060
Yeah, um, so, I was wondering if, uh,
839
01:00:10,077 --> 01:00:12,065
if, you know, you'd give me another crack at it.
840
01:00:12,077 --> 01:00:15,032
You know, let me take you out again.
841
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:18,007
- I can't.  - All right.
842
01:00:18,011 --> 01:00:21,053
Oh, no, I didn't... I didn't mean I can't, like, ever.
843
01:00:21,061 --> 01:00:23,053
I just can't right now.
844
01:00:23,062 --> 01:00:26,062
I've got to assign the proton spectrum for "ebogamine."
845
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:30,071
All that sounds really, really interesting. It's actually fantastically boring.
846
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,063
- All right, um...  - Maybe some other time.
847
01:00:33,075 --> 01:00:37,076
- Like tomorrow?  - Um, yeah, all right.
848
01:00:37,084 --> 01:00:40,034
- Okay.  - Okay.
849
01:00:40,034 --> 01:00:42,072
- Bye.  - Bye.
850
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,094
What are you doing here?
851
01:00:57,002 --> 01:00:59,028
I couldn't wait till tomorrow.
852
01:00:59,036 --> 01:01:02,028
Where the fuck did you get this?
853
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,049
I had to sleep with someone in your class.
854
01:01:04,057 --> 01:01:10,016
Oh, I hope it was someone with the open-toed sandals and the really bad breath.
855
01:01:10,029 --> 01:01:14,025
- Come on. Let's go have some fun.  - No, I've got to learn this.
856
01:01:14,033 --> 01:01:17,004
Well, you're not going into surgery tomorrow, are you?
857
01:01:17,004 --> 01:01:19,000
- No.  - Let's go.
858
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:26,060
Oh, my God! My dog is winning!
859
01:01:26,072 --> 01:01:28,097
Come on, Misty!
860
01:01:29,001 --> 01:01:31,077
Come on! Run! Look at that! Come on!
861
01:01:31,085 --> 01:01:33,081
Look, there he goes. Misty, run! Come on!
862
01:01:36,015 --> 01:01:40,036
- We won.  - He totally won.
863
01:01:42,024 --> 01:01:44,053
So did you grow up around here then?
864
01:01:44,053 --> 01:01:46,078
Not far. South Boston.
865
01:01:49,037 --> 01:01:51,037
Still glowing from my win.
866
01:01:51,037 --> 01:01:55,000
Look at you. You're so happy.
867
01:01:55,004 --> 01:01:57,017
And what was that like then?
868
01:01:57,021 --> 01:02:00,084
It was normal, I guess. Nothing special.
869
01:02:00,092 --> 01:02:04,009
Do you got lots of brothers and sisters?
870
01:02:04,017 --> 01:02:07,043
- Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?  - That's what I said.
871
01:02:07,051 --> 01:02:13,006
- Well, Irish Catholic, what do you think?  - Right. That's right.
872
01:02:13,010 --> 01:02:18,011
- How many?  - You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
873
01:02:18,015 --> 01:02:21,069
- Why? Go on. What? Five?  - No.
874
01:02:21,073 --> 01:02:25,003
Seven? Eight? How many?
875
01:02:25,011 --> 01:02:27,032
- I have 12 big brothers.  - You do not!
876
01:02:27,036 --> 01:02:30,020
No, I swear to God. I swear to God. I'm lucky 13 right here.
877
01:02:30,028 --> 01:02:32,033
Do you know all their names?
878
01:02:32,033 --> 01:02:34,091
Do I... Yeah, they're my brothers.
879
01:02:34,096 --> 01:02:37,004
What are they called?
880
01:02:37,012 --> 01:02:38,074
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry,
881
01:02:38,074 --> 01:02:39,076
Mikey, Davey, Timmy,
882
01:02:39,076 --> 01:02:41,046
Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny and Brian.
883
01:02:41,059 --> 01:02:44,001
Say it again.
884
01:02:44,009 --> 01:02:45,062
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry,
885
01:02:45,062 --> 01:02:46,057
Mikey, Davey, Timmy,
886
01:02:46,058 --> 01:02:48,018
Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny and Brian.
887
01:02:48,022 --> 01:02:50,085
And Willy.
888
01:02:50,093 --> 01:02:52,022
- Willy?  - Yeah.
889
01:02:52,031 --> 01:02:53,081
- Will.  - Wow.
890
01:02:53,085 --> 01:02:57,064
- Do you still see all of them?  - Yeah, well, they all live in Southie.
891
01:02:57,077 --> 01:03:00,036
- I'm living with three of them right now.  - Oh, yeah?
892
01:03:00,044 --> 01:03:01,094
- Yeah.  - I'd like to meet them.
893
01:03:01,098 --> 01:03:04,036
Yeah, we'll do that.
894
01:03:04,057 --> 01:03:06,099
Oh, you know, I read your book last night.
895
01:03:06,099 --> 01:03:09,057
Oh, so you're the one.
896
01:03:09,066 --> 01:03:11,058
Do you still, uh... Do you still counsel veterans?
897
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:12,099
No, I don't.
898
01:03:13,008 --> 01:03:17,075
- Why not?  - Well, I gave it up when my wife got sick.
899
01:03:17,079 --> 01:03:21,057
You ever wonder what your life would be like if you,
900
01:03:21,057 --> 01:03:23,034
uh, if you never met your wife?
901
01:03:23,038 --> 01:03:25,030
What? Wonder if I'd be better off without her?
902
01:03:25,042 --> 01:03:27,055
- No, no, no, I'm not saying, like, better off.  - No.
903
01:03:27,059 --> 01:03:31,055
- I didn't mean it like that.  - It's all right. It's an important question.
904
01:03:31,068 --> 01:03:33,093
because you'll have bad times, but that'll always wake you up...
905
01:03:34,001 --> 01:03:36,027
to the good stuff you weren't paying attention to.
906
01:03:36,039 --> 01:03:38,089
And you don't regret meeting your wife?
907
01:03:39,002 --> 01:03:41,073
Why? because the pain I feel now?
908
01:03:41,081 --> 01:03:47,015
Oh, I got regrets, Will, but I don't regret a single day I spent with her.
909
01:03:50,099 --> 01:03:54,037
So when did you know, like, that she was the one for you?
910
01:03:54,045 --> 01:03:57,016
October 21, 1975.
911
01:03:57,016 --> 01:03:59,037
Jesus Christ. You know the fucking day?
912
01:03:59,042 --> 01:04:02,022
Oh, yeah, because it was game six of the World Series,
913
01:04:02,022 --> 01:04:04,042
biggest game in Red Sox history.
914
01:04:04,050 --> 01:04:09,059
- Yeah, sure.  - My friends and I had slept out all night to get tickets.
915
01:04:09,068 --> 01:04:13,014
- You got tickets?  - Yep. Day of the game I was sitting in a bar,
916
01:04:13,022 --> 01:04:16,072
waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl.
917
01:04:16,081 --> 01:04:20,019
It was an amazing game though. You know, bottom of the eighth, Carbo ties it up.
918
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:22,035
It was 6-6. It went to 12.
919
01:04:22,035 --> 01:04:26,032
Bottom of the 12th, in stepped Carlton Fisk, old Pudge.
920
01:04:26,036 --> 01:04:28,044
Steps up to the plate. You know, he's got that weird stance.
921
01:04:28,044 --> 01:04:32,007
- Yeah, yeah.  - And then... Boom! He clocks it, you know.
922
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:34,083
High fly ball down the left field line!
923
01:04:34,087 --> 01:04:37,045
Thirty-five thousand people on their feet, yelling at the ball.
924
01:04:37,058 --> 01:04:40,004
But that's nothing, because Fisk, he's waving at the ball like a madman.
925
01:04:40,012 --> 01:04:42,004
- Yeah, I've seen that.  - "Get over! Get over!
926
01:04:42,012 --> 01:04:43,054
- Right.  - Get over!"
927
01:04:43,071 --> 01:04:48,005
Then it hits the foul pole. He goes ape-shit, and 35,000 fans...
928
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:50,017
They charge the field, you know.
929
01:04:50,022 --> 01:04:52,059
Yeah, and he's fucking blowing people outta the way.
930
01:04:52,072 --> 01:04:54,085
"Get outta the way! Get outta the way!"
931
01:04:54,097 --> 01:04:58,002
I can't fucking believe you had tickets to that fucking game!
932
01:04:58,002 --> 01:04:59,037
Did you rush the field?
933
01:04:59,037 --> 01:05:01,014
No, I didn't rush the fucking field. I wasn't there.
934
01:05:01,027 --> 01:05:04,027
- What?  - No, I was in a bar, having a drink with my future wife.
935
01:05:04,031 --> 01:05:06,072
You missed Pudge Fisk's home run to have a fucking drink
936
01:05:06,072 --> 01:05:08,094
with some lady you never met?
937
01:05:09,007 --> 01:05:11,020
Yeah, but you should have seen her. She was a stunner.
938
01:05:11,024 --> 01:05:13,078
- I don't care if...  - Oh, no, no, she lit up the room.
939
01:05:13,095 --> 01:05:16,087
- I don't care if Helen of Troy walks into the room.  - Oh, Helen of Troy!
940
01:05:16,091 --> 01:05:18,026
That's game six! Oh, my God,
941
01:05:18,026 --> 01:05:19,008
and who were these friends of yours?
942
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:21,046
- They let you get away with that?  - They had to.
943
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:25,013
- What did you say to them?  - I just slid my ticket across the table.
944
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:28,030
I said, "Sorry, guys. I gotta see about a girl."
945
01:05:28,042 --> 01:05:30,055
- "I gotta go see about a girl"?  - Yes!
946
01:05:30,055 --> 01:05:32,063
That's what you said? They let you get away with that?
947
01:05:32,063 --> 01:05:34,072
Oh, yeah. They saw it in my eyes that I meant it.
948
01:05:34,089 --> 01:05:38,072
- You're kidding me?  - No, I'm not kidding you, Will.
949
01:05:38,072 --> 01:05:41,043
That's why I'm not talking right now about some girl I saw at a bar 20 years ago...
950
01:05:41,048 --> 01:05:43,094
and how I always regretted not going over and talking to her.
951
01:05:43,098 --> 01:05:47,015
I don't regret the 18 years I was married to Nancy.
952
01:05:47,023 --> 01:05:50,023
I don't regret the six years I had to give up counseling when she got sick,
953
01:05:50,036 --> 01:05:54,003
and I don't regret the last years when she got really sick.
954
01:05:54,015 --> 01:05:56,078
And I sure as hell don't regret missing a damn game.
955
01:05:56,087 --> 01:05:59,058
That's regret.
956
01:05:59,066 --> 01:06:01,095
Wow!
957
01:06:06,096 --> 01:06:09,059
Would have been nice to catch that game though.
958
01:06:09,071 --> 01:06:12,026
I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit a home run.
959
01:06:14,034 --> 01:06:18,039
You know, I'm very, very useful on the court.
960
01:06:18,047 --> 01:06:21,052
I'm extremely tall.
961
01:06:21,064 --> 01:06:24,048
- You're not that tall.  - I dunk.
962
01:06:26,002 --> 01:06:30,069
Will I ever play in the N.B.A.?
963
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:34,024
"It is decidedly so." Hmph.
964
01:06:36,074 --> 01:06:39,032
Why do we always stay here?
965
01:06:39,041 --> 01:06:42,004
because it's nicer than my place.
966
01:06:42,008 --> 01:06:44,058
Yes, but I've never seen your place.
967
01:06:44,066 --> 01:06:46,092
I know.
968
01:06:46,096 --> 01:06:49,046
When am I gonna meet your friends and your brothers?
969
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:52,096
Well, they don't really come down here that much.
970
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:55,017
I think I can make it to South Boston.
971
01:06:55,026 --> 01:06:59,093
It's kind of a hike.
972
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:02,097
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
973
01:07:03,006 --> 01:07:05,060
- All right, we'll go.  - When?
974
01:07:05,064 --> 01:07:08,010
I don't know. We'll go sometime next week.
975
01:07:08,010 --> 01:07:10,064
What if I said I would not sleep
976
01:07:10,064 --> 01:07:13,061
with you again until you let me meet your friends?
977
01:07:19,028 --> 01:07:22,095
I'd say it's, like, 4:30 in the morning. They're probably up.
978
01:07:22,099 --> 01:07:26,033
Oh, my God. Men are shameless.
979
01:07:26,033 --> 01:07:28,068
If you're not thinking with your wiener,
980
01:07:28,068 --> 01:07:30,071
then you're acting directly on its behalf.
981
01:07:30,071 --> 01:07:34,030
You bet. And on behalf of my wiener, can I get an advance payment?
982
01:07:34,034 --> 01:07:39,013
I don't know. Let's ask. "Outlook does not look good."
983
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:42,055
- What?  - Fuck the... Hey, Chuck. No. Nothing. Go back to sleep.
984
01:07:42,064 --> 01:07:45,085
"Outlook"? That's the same thing that told you you was gonna play in the N.B.A.
985
01:07:45,093 --> 01:07:50,002
Exactly, so look out. You'd better start buying some season tickets.
986
01:07:50,006 --> 01:07:54,086
Mmm! I plan to. I'm tall. I like wearing shorts.
987
01:07:54,094 --> 01:07:57,019
Hook, hook. Dunk, dunk.
988
01:07:57,019 --> 01:08:00,003
- You're not that tall.  - Yes, I am.
989
01:08:00,011 --> 01:08:03,016
Maybe I'm all about three points.
990
01:08:03,024 --> 01:08:05,049
I'm all about home runs.
991
01:08:05,054 --> 01:08:09,075
Stop mixing your sporting metaphors.
992
01:08:21,034 --> 01:08:24,085
A leprechaun's got his dick in the monkey's ass.
993
01:08:24,097 --> 01:08:28,068
Morgan comes running in, going, "I don't mind it. I don't mind..."
994
01:08:30,077 --> 01:08:32,089
Well, I can't believe you brought Skylar here
995
01:08:32,089 --> 01:08:34,048
when we're fucking all bombed and drinking.
996
01:08:34,057 --> 01:08:37,086
I know, Morgan. It's a real rarity we'd be all drinking.
997
01:08:37,090 --> 01:08:40,082
My uncle Marty drinks. He'll go on a bender for six, eight months.
998
01:08:40,086 --> 01:08:42,018
Did I ever tell ya what happened to him
999
01:08:42,019 --> 01:08:43,074
when he was driving up there and got pulled over?
1000
01:08:43,074 --> 01:08:46,004
- I told you guys, right?  - Marty, yeah.
1001
01:08:46,008 --> 01:08:49,071
Let me tell ya what happened to my uncle Marty, because you oughta know this.
1002
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:53,017
He's always telling stories. Every time we come here he's got another story.
1003
01:08:53,021 --> 01:08:57,025
But we all heard this one. Go ahead. Say it anyway.
1004
01:08:57,025 --> 01:09:02,043
I will go ahead. Thanks a lot. Guess I have the floor now.
1005
01:09:02,043 --> 01:09:05,018
My uncle Marty's driving home, right?
1006
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:07,018
Bombed out of his tree, right?
1007
01:09:07,018 --> 01:09:10,002
Just hammered out of his gourd. Just wrecked.
1008
01:09:10,006 --> 01:09:14,023
This state trooper sees him, pulls him over. So my uncle's fucked basically.
1009
01:09:14,036 --> 01:09:16,052
Got him out of the car, trying to make him walk the line.
1010
01:09:16,065 --> 01:09:18,054
He gets out of the car, pukes,
1011
01:09:18,054 --> 01:09:20,044
and the statie's pretty sure he's over the legal limit.
1012
01:09:20,053 --> 01:09:24,032
So he's about to throw the cuffs on him and put him in jail.
1013
01:09:24,045 --> 01:09:28,041
All of a sudden, 50 yards down the road, there's this huge fucking boom.
1014
01:09:28,054 --> 01:09:32,000
- Statie gets real spooked. He turns around...  - He got shot?
1015
01:09:32,016 --> 01:09:35,008
No. So... So... You heard this story before.
1016
01:09:35,013 --> 01:09:37,004
Yeah, Morgan, stop. Stop.
1017
01:09:37,004 --> 01:09:40,046
Some other guy's car had hit a tree. There was an accident.
1018
01:09:40,055 --> 01:09:42,047
Anyway...
1019
01:09:42,055 --> 01:09:44,068
- How could he hear...  - Shut the fuck up!
1020
01:09:44,076 --> 01:09:47,072
- You're driving him nuts.  - I'm gonna break your neck. Shut up!
1021
01:09:47,081 --> 01:09:49,077
He told you the story once before.
1022
01:09:49,081 --> 01:09:52,052
So he tells my uncle, "Stay here. Don't move."
1023
01:09:52,056 --> 01:09:56,052
Statie goes running down the road to deal with the other accident.
1024
01:09:56,056 --> 01:10:00,053
After a few minutes of just lying in his own piss and vomit,
1025
01:10:00,061 --> 01:10:02,061
my uncle starts wondering what he's doing there.
1026
01:10:02,061 --> 01:10:05,020
Gets up, gets in his car and just drives home.
1027
01:10:05,028 --> 01:10:08,033
The next morning my uncle's just passed out.
1028
01:10:08,033 --> 01:10:10,058
He hears this knocking at the door.
1029
01:10:10,062 --> 01:10:13,062
So he goes downstairs, pulls the door open... "What?"
1030
01:10:13,062 --> 01:10:15,067
It's the state trooper that pulled him over.
1031
01:10:15,067 --> 01:10:17,071
Statie says, "Fuck you mean, 'What?'
1032
01:10:17,075 --> 01:10:21,026
You know what. I pulled you over last night is what, and you took off."
1033
01:10:21,034 --> 01:10:23,084
He's like, "l never seen you before in my life.
1034
01:10:23,097 --> 01:10:26,064
I've been home all night with my kids. I don't know who the fuck you are."
1035
01:10:26,076 --> 01:10:30,006
He's like, "You know who I am. Let me get in your garage."
1036
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:32,047
My uncle's like, "What?" He said, "You heard me. Let me get in your garage."
1037
01:10:32,052 --> 01:10:35,014
He was like, "All right. Fine." Takes him out to the garage, opens the door.
1038
01:10:35,027 --> 01:10:40,048
And there's... The statie's police cruiser is in my uncle's garage.
1039
01:10:40,052 --> 01:10:43,007
He was so fucking...
1040
01:10:43,011 --> 01:10:45,053
He was so fucking hammered he drove the wrong car home.
1041
01:10:45,061 --> 01:10:49,041
The best part about it is, the fucking state trooper...
1042
01:10:49,053 --> 01:10:51,091
was so embarrassed he didn't do anything.
1043
01:10:51,099 --> 01:10:55,033
He'd been driving around all night in my uncle's Chevelle, looking for the house.
1044
01:10:55,037 --> 01:10:59,046
All right, Chuck, what the fuck is the point of your story?
1045
01:10:59,046 --> 01:11:01,071
He got away. That's the point.
1046
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:05,001
- Well, question...  - Come on. Stop.
1047
01:11:05,005 --> 01:11:07,089
- I'm trying to clarify something.  - You're embarrassing him.
1048
01:11:07,089 --> 01:11:10,039
- It doesn't make any sense.  - It does make sense,
1049
01:11:10,043 --> 01:11:12,047
if you listen to the story and quit asking questions.
1050
01:11:12,051 --> 01:11:15,085
Well, let's see if you can get this one. I've got a little story for you.
1051
01:11:15,085 --> 01:11:20,065
All right, there's an old couple in bed, Mary and Paddie.
1052
01:11:20,073 --> 01:11:26,028
They wake up on the morning of their 50th anniversary.
1053
01:11:26,036 --> 01:11:29,049
Mary looks over and gazes adoringly at Paddie.
1054
01:11:29,057 --> 01:11:31,062
She's like, "Oh, Jesus, Paddie.
1055
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:33,095
You're such a good-looking feller. I love ya.
1056
01:11:34,008 --> 01:11:36,041
I want to give ya a little present.
1057
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:39,042
Anything your little heart desires, I'm going to give it to ya.
1058
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:41,042
What would ya like?
1059
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:46,017
Paddie's like, "Oh, gee, Mary. That's a very sweet offer.
1060
01:11:46,026 --> 01:11:51,018
Now, in 50 years, there's one thing that's been missing,
1061
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:55,002
and, uh, I would like you to give me a blow job.
1062
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:58,077
I would like for it." Mary's like, "All right."
1063
01:11:58,085 --> 01:12:03,027
She takes her teeth out, puts them in the glass. She gives him a blow job.
1064
01:12:03,036 --> 01:12:07,028
Afterwards, Paddie's like, "Yeah, geez, now that's what I've been missing.
1065
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:11,028
That was the most beautiful, earth-shattering thing ever!
1066
01:12:11,028 --> 01:12:13,062
Beautiful, Mary! I love ya!
1067
01:12:13,074 --> 01:12:16,070
Is there anything that I can do for you?"
1068
01:12:16,075 --> 01:12:21,038
Mary looks up to him and she goes, "Give us a kiss."
1069
01:12:21,046 --> 01:12:23,079
- Oh!  - Oh, my God!
1070
01:12:23,084 --> 01:12:27,017
- That's filthy.  - It's not that filthy. I've heard filthy.
1071
01:12:31,064 --> 01:12:35,056
- Get off of me!  - All right. See you guys later.
1072
01:12:35,072 --> 01:12:38,093
All right. Take it easy, Bill.
1073
01:12:39,002 --> 01:12:41,048
So, Skylar, thanks for coming by.
1074
01:12:41,056 --> 01:12:43,052
Changed my opinion of Harvard people.
1075
01:12:43,056 --> 01:12:47,007
You don't want to rush to judgment on that one, because they're not all like me.
1076
01:12:47,015 --> 01:12:49,090
Oh. I'm sure. It was nice to meet ya.
1077
01:12:49,095 --> 01:12:52,057
- Oh.  - Take it easy. Slowly back away.
1078
01:12:52,061 --> 01:12:56,074
- Oh, come on. Brother.  - I don't know what you're doing, dude.
1079
01:12:56,083 --> 01:12:59,050
- You're giving us a ride.  - What the fuck do I look like to you?
1080
01:12:59,058 --> 01:13:02,096
- Come on, Chuck.  - You're walking, bitch. Will's taking the car.
1081
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:06,030
All right, thanks, sucker. I appreciate it.
1082
01:13:06,034 --> 01:13:09,030
I don't know what you're getting all serious about.
1083
01:13:09,034 --> 01:13:13,026
- You're dropping me off first.  - It's really out of the way.
1084
01:13:13,034 --> 01:13:16,022
Oh, okay. Just because you don't have to sleep in your one-room palace tonight...
1085
01:13:16,026 --> 01:13:18,018
don't start thinking you're bad.
1086
01:13:18,031 --> 01:13:20,052
Hey, wait a minute. You said we were gonna see your place.
1087
01:13:20,068 --> 01:13:23,081
- Not tonight.  - Oh, no, not tonight. Not any other night.
1088
01:13:23,085 --> 01:13:27,040
He knows once you see that shit-hole he's getting dropped like a bad habit.
1089
01:13:27,052 --> 01:13:29,049
But I wanted to meet your brothers.
1090
01:13:29,061 --> 01:13:32,003
We're gonna do that another time.
1091
01:13:32,011 --> 01:13:34,003
All right.
1092
01:13:35,091 --> 01:13:38,029
Need them keys.
1093
01:13:38,033 --> 01:13:42,033
The stewardess hears this and goes hauling ass down the aisle.
1094
01:13:42,037 --> 01:13:45,071
I yell, "Don't forget the coffee."
1095
01:13:45,083 --> 01:13:47,075
No shit! You didn't say that.
1096
01:13:47,092 --> 01:13:50,034
For Christ's sake, Marty, it's a joke.
1097
01:13:50,038 --> 01:13:52,055
- I know someone that actually happened to, Marty.  - A joke.
1098
01:13:52,059 --> 01:13:54,026
- Gerry.  - Hi.
1099
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:56,026
- Have trouble finding the place?  - No, I took a cab.
1100
01:13:56,035 --> 01:14:00,022
Timmy, this is Gerry. We went to college together.
1101
01:14:00,027 --> 01:14:02,043
How you doing? Nice to meet ya.
1102
01:14:02,052 --> 01:14:04,044
- Pleased to meet you.  - Can I get you a beer?
1103
01:14:04,052 --> 01:14:06,090
Um, no, just a Perrier.
1104
01:14:07,006 --> 01:14:08,094
That's French for club soda.
1105
01:14:09,011 --> 01:14:11,069
- Club soda, yeah.  - Couple of sandwiches too.
1106
01:14:11,074 --> 01:14:13,065
- Sure.  - Put it on my tab.
1107
01:14:13,074 --> 01:14:16,003
You ever planning on paying your tab?
1108
01:14:16,007 --> 01:14:18,028
Yeah, chief, got the winning lottery ticket right here.
1109
01:14:18,033 --> 01:14:20,004
- What's the jackpot?  - Twelve million.
1110
01:14:20,008 --> 01:14:24,083
- I don't think that'll cover it.  - It'll cover your sex change operation.
1111
01:14:28,017 --> 01:14:32,001
- Nuts?  - No, thank you.
1112
01:14:34,051 --> 01:14:37,068
So, you wanted to talk about Will.
1113
01:14:37,072 --> 01:14:41,052
- Well, it seems to be going well.  - I think so.
1114
01:14:42,098 --> 01:14:45,081
Have you talked to him at all about his future?
1115
01:14:45,089 --> 01:14:49,065
No, we haven't gotten into that yet. We're still banging away at the past.
1116
01:14:49,065 --> 01:14:53,019
Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
1117
01:14:53,028 --> 01:14:57,016
- What kind?  - Cutting edge mathematics, think tanks.
1118
01:14:57,024 --> 01:15:00,058
The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free rein.
1119
01:15:00,066 --> 01:15:06,029
That's great that there are offers, but I don't really think he's ready for that.
1120
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,030
I'm not sure you understand, Sean.
1121
01:15:12,034 --> 01:15:15,005
- What don't I understand?  - Here you go, guys.
1122
01:15:15,013 --> 01:15:18,034
- Thanks, Tim.  - Yeah, thank you.
1123
01:15:18,039 --> 01:15:20,076
Just so you don't get sticky fingers.
1124
01:15:20,085 --> 01:15:23,022
Tim, can you help us?
1125
01:15:23,035 --> 01:15:25,081
We're trying to settle a bet.
1126
01:15:25,085 --> 01:15:27,031
Uh-oh.
1127
01:15:27,035 --> 01:15:28,074
Ever heard of Jonas Salk?
1128
01:15:28,074 --> 01:15:30,077
Sure. Cured polio.
1129
01:15:30,086 --> 01:15:33,048
- Ever heard of Albert Einstein?  - Hey.
1130
01:15:35,078 --> 01:15:38,099
How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard of him?
1131
01:15:39,007 --> 01:15:42,083
- No.  - Thank you, Tim.
1132
01:15:42,087 --> 01:15:44,083
- So who won the bet?  - I did.
1133
01:15:46,091 --> 01:15:51,029
This isn't about me, Sean.
1134
01:15:51,038 --> 01:15:54,025
I'm nothing compared to this young man.
1135
01:15:57,076 --> 01:15:59,072
You ever hear of Gerald Lambeau?
1136
01:15:59,072 --> 01:16:01,049
In 1905 there were hundreds
1137
01:16:01,050 --> 01:16:04,039
of professors renown for their study of the universe.
1138
01:16:04,047 --> 01:16:09,006
But it was a 26-year-old Swiss patent clerk,
1139
01:16:09,006 --> 01:16:11,069
doing physics in his spare time, who changed the world.
1140
01:16:11,086 --> 01:16:13,073
Can you imagine if Einstein would have given that up...
1141
01:16:13,077 --> 01:16:16,028
just to get drunk with his buddies in Vienna every night.
1142
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:19,003
We all would have lost something.
1143
01:16:19,007 --> 01:16:21,012
Tim would never have heard of him.
1144
01:16:21,016 --> 01:16:24,024
- Pretty dramatic, Gerry.  - No, it isn't, Sean.
1145
01:16:24,028 --> 01:16:26,091
This boy has that gift.
1146
01:16:27,004 --> 01:16:29,050
He just doesn't got the direction, but we can give that to him.
1147
01:16:29,058 --> 01:16:31,083
Hey, Gerry, in the 1960s,
1148
01:16:31,084 --> 01:16:34,092
there was a young man graduated from University of Michigan.
1149
01:16:34,092 --> 01:16:38,022
Did some brilliant work in mathematics.
1150
01:16:38,030 --> 01:16:40,072
Specifically, bounded harmonic functions.
1151
01:16:40,076 --> 01:16:43,085
Then he went on to Berkeley. He was assistant professor. Showed amazing potential.
1152
01:16:43,093 --> 01:16:46,085
Then he moved to Montana, and he blew the competition away.
1153
01:16:46,097 --> 01:16:49,081
- Yeah, so who was he?  - Ted Kaczynski.
1154
01:16:49,089 --> 01:16:51,077
Haven't heard of him.
1155
01:16:51,085 --> 01:16:53,081
- Hey, Timmy!  - Yo!
1156
01:16:53,081 --> 01:16:56,065
- Who's Ted Kaczynski?  - Unabomber.
1157
01:16:58,053 --> 01:17:01,057
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
1158
01:17:01,070 --> 01:17:03,062
- We gotta give this kid direction.  - Yeah...
1159
01:17:03,074 --> 01:17:06,004
He can contribute to the world, and we can help him do that.
1160
01:17:06,004 --> 01:17:08,012
Direction's one thing. Manipulation's another.
1161
01:17:08,029 --> 01:17:11,012
- Sean...  - We have to let him find...
1162
01:17:11,021 --> 01:17:12,017
I'm not sitting at home every night
1163
01:17:12,017 --> 01:17:13,096
twisting my mustache and hatching a plan...
1164
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,096
to ruin this boy's life!
1165
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,042
I was doing advanced mathematics when I was 18,
1166
01:17:18,051 --> 01:17:20,097
and it still took me over 20 years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
1167
01:17:21,009 --> 01:17:23,043
Maybe he doesn't want what you want.
1168
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:26,035
There's more to life than a fucking Field's medal.
1169
01:17:26,039 --> 01:17:30,035
This is too important, Sean, and it's above personal rivalry.
1170
01:17:30,039 --> 01:17:32,081
Wait a minute. Let's talk about the boy.
1171
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:35,061
Why don't we give him time to figure out what he wants?
1172
01:17:35,069 --> 01:17:38,094
That's a wonderful theory, Sean. It worked wonders for you, didn't it?
1173
01:17:39,003 --> 01:17:41,065
Yeah, it did, you arrogant fucking prick!
1174
01:17:43,003 --> 01:17:46,049
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I came here today.
1175
01:17:46,058 --> 01:17:48,079
I came here out of courtesy. I wanted to keep you in the loop.
1176
01:17:48,083 --> 01:17:50,091
Nice to be in the loop.
1177
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,063
The boy's in a meeting right now I set up for him over at McNeil.
1178
01:17:54,067 --> 01:17:59,009
Well, Will, I'm not exactly sure what you mean.
1179
01:17:59,013 --> 01:18:01,055
We've already offered you a position.
1180
01:18:01,063 --> 01:18:03,063
Nobody in this town works without a retainer, guys.
1181
01:18:03,072 --> 01:18:07,001
You think you can find somebody who does, you have my blessing.
1182
01:18:07,005 --> 01:18:10,027
But I think we all know that person is not gonna represent you as well as I can.
1183
01:18:10,039 --> 01:18:13,052
Will, our offer is $84,000 a year.
1184
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:18,036
Retainer! Retainer.
1185
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:21,015
You want us to give you cash right now?
1186
01:18:21,028 --> 01:18:25,032
Whoa-ho-ho. Easy... Now, I didn't say that.
1187
01:18:25,036 --> 01:18:30,058
Allegedly, your situation, for you,
1188
01:18:30,070 --> 01:18:34,054
would be concurrently improved if I had...
1189
01:18:34,058 --> 01:18:37,025
$200 in my back pocket right now.
1190
01:18:37,038 --> 01:18:42,030
I don't think I can... Larry?
1191
01:18:42,042 --> 01:18:46,068
- I've got $73.  - Will you take a check?
1192
01:18:46,072 --> 01:18:51,047
Let me tell you something. You're suspect.
1193
01:18:51,056 --> 01:18:56,090
Yeah, you. I don't know what your reputation is in this town,
1194
01:18:56,098 --> 01:18:59,069
but after the shit you tried to pull today,
1195
01:18:59,073 --> 01:19:02,036
you can bet I'll be looking into you.
1196
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:07,032
Now, any business we have heretofore,
1197
01:19:07,041 --> 01:19:11,024
you can speak with my aforementioned attorney.
1198
01:19:11,029 --> 01:19:13,045
Good day, gentlemen.
1199
01:19:13,054 --> 01:19:17,029
And until that day comes, keep your ear to the grindstone.
1200
01:19:31,064 --> 01:19:33,052
- How's it going?  - Fine.
1201
01:19:33,064 --> 01:19:35,064
Yeah.
1202
01:19:35,077 --> 01:19:37,069
Good.
1203
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:41,036
- Want some help?  - No!
1204
01:19:41,044 --> 01:19:44,061
Come on. Give me one little peek, and we'll go to the batting cages.
1205
01:19:44,069 --> 01:19:46,090
No.
1206
01:19:46,095 --> 01:19:50,062
It is actually important that I learn this.
1207
01:19:50,070 --> 01:19:54,050
- It's really important... to me, okay?  - All right.
1208
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,042
- Why don't we just hang out here all day?  - Yes, why don't we?
1209
01:20:01,084 --> 01:20:05,051
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker.
1210
01:20:05,059 --> 01:20:10,039
Seeing as you're intent on breaking my balls,
1211
01:20:10,043 --> 01:20:14,001
- let me ask you a question.  - All right.
1212
01:20:14,014 --> 01:20:16,010
Do you have a photographic memory?
1213
01:20:18,023 --> 01:20:20,003
I don't know. I just kind of remember.
1214
01:20:20,004 --> 01:20:22,015
I mean, how do you remember your phone number?
1215
01:20:22,019 --> 01:20:24,015
You just do.
1216
01:20:24,019 --> 01:20:27,011
- Have you studied organic chemistry?  - A little bit.
1217
01:20:27,015 --> 01:20:30,007
- Oh, just for fun?  - Yeah, for kicks.
1218
01:20:30,011 --> 01:20:32,078
Yeah, it's so much fun studying organic chemistry.
1219
01:20:32,078 --> 01:20:35,041
Are you mad?
1220
01:20:35,049 --> 01:20:37,091
Have you completely lost your mind?
1221
01:20:38,008 --> 01:20:40,013
Nobody studies it for fun.
1222
01:20:40,013 --> 01:20:42,071
It's not a necessity, especially for someone like you.
1223
01:20:42,075 --> 01:20:45,021
- Someone like me?  - Yeah.
1224
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:49,055
Someone who divides their time, fairly evenly, between batting cages and bars.
1225
01:20:49,063 --> 01:20:54,014
- I would hardly say it was a necessity.  - Oh.
1226
01:20:54,022 --> 01:20:57,002
You know, there are very smart people here at Harvard.
1227
01:20:57,018 --> 01:21:01,002
Even they have to study, because this is really hard.
1228
01:21:01,019 --> 01:21:06,086
And yet... you do it so easily. I don't understand.
1229
01:21:06,090 --> 01:21:08,099
I don't understand how your mind works.
1230
01:21:09,003 --> 01:21:11,024
- Did you play the piano?  - I want to talk about this.
1231
01:21:11,041 --> 01:21:13,053
No, I'm trying to explain it to you. Do you play the piano?
1232
01:21:13,057 --> 01:21:18,016
- Yeah, a bit.  - So when you look at a piano, you see Mozart.
1233
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:21,083
- I see "Chopsticks."  - All right, well, Beethoven, okay?
1234
01:21:21,087 --> 01:21:25,075
He looked at a piano, and it just made sense to him. He could just play.
1235
01:21:25,075 --> 01:21:28,005
- So what are you saying? You play the piano?  - Not a lick.
1236
01:21:28,013 --> 01:21:32,001
I look at a piano, I see a bunch of keys, three pedals and a box of wood.
1237
01:21:32,005 --> 01:21:34,020
But Beethoven, Mozart...
1238
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:36,089
They saw it. They could just play.
1239
01:21:36,093 --> 01:21:40,098
I couldn't paint you a picture. I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway.
1240
01:21:41,002 --> 01:21:43,012
And I can't play the piano.
1241
01:21:43,012 --> 01:21:46,040
But you can do my O-chem paper in under an hour.
1242
01:21:46,048 --> 01:21:49,091
Right. Well, I mean, when it came to stuff like that,
1243
01:21:49,091 --> 01:21:52,003
I could always just play.
1244
01:21:53,041 --> 01:21:55,032
That's the best I can explain it.
1245
01:21:55,045 --> 01:21:59,045
- Come here. I have to tell you something.  - Huh?
1246
01:21:59,050 --> 01:22:02,029
- I have to tell you something.  - Oh.
1247
01:22:02,033 --> 01:22:04,033
Well...
1248
01:22:18,081 --> 01:22:23,048
- It's not fair.  - What's not fair? What?
1249
01:22:23,052 --> 01:22:26,065
I've been here for four years,
1250
01:22:26,069 --> 01:22:30,015
and I've only just found you.
1251
01:22:30,015 --> 01:22:32,061
Well, you found me.
1252
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:48,017
- Are you awake?  - No.
1253
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:51,067
Yes, you are.
1254
01:22:54,029 --> 01:22:56,076
Come to California with me.
1255
01:22:59,026 --> 01:23:01,018
What?
1256
01:23:03,018 --> 01:23:06,031
I want you to come to California with me.
1257
01:23:11,007 --> 01:23:15,082
- You sure about that?  - Oh, yeah.
1258
01:23:15,086 --> 01:23:19,003
Yeah, but how do you know?
1259
01:23:19,007 --> 01:23:23,025
I don't know. I just know.
1260
01:23:23,029 --> 01:23:26,004
Yeah, but how do you know?
1261
01:23:26,012 --> 01:23:29,021
I know because I feel it.
1262
01:23:29,021 --> 01:23:34,013
- Because that's a really serious thing you're saying.  - I know.
1263
01:23:34,026 --> 01:23:36,068
You could be in California next week...
1264
01:23:36,076 --> 01:23:39,097
and you might find out something about me you don't like.
1265
01:23:40,001 --> 01:23:42,010
Maybe you wish you hadn't said that,
1266
01:23:42,014 --> 01:23:44,052
but you know it's such a serious thing you can't take it back.
1267
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:47,073
Now I'm stuck in California with someone that doesn't really want to be with me,
1268
01:23:47,077 --> 01:23:52,036
- just wish they had a take-back.  - A what? What's a take-back?
1269
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:58,028
I don't want a take-back. I just want you to come to California with me.
1270
01:23:58,041 --> 01:24:02,008
Well, I can't go to California with you, so...
1271
01:24:03,016 --> 01:24:05,012
Why not?
1272
01:24:05,012 --> 01:24:09,029
Well, one, because I got a job here.
1273
01:24:09,038 --> 01:24:12,067
And, two, because I live here.
1274
01:24:12,075 --> 01:24:17,026
Look, um, if you don't love me, you should just tell me.
1275
01:24:17,030 --> 01:24:19,022
I'm not saying I don't love you.
1276
01:24:19,034 --> 01:24:24,047
Then why? Why won't you come? What are you so scared of?
1277
01:24:24,052 --> 01:24:27,048
What am I so scared of?
1278
01:24:27,052 --> 01:24:30,027
Well, what aren't you scared of?
1279
01:24:30,031 --> 01:24:33,027
You live in this safe little world where no one challenges you...
1280
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:35,048
Don't tell me about my world.
1281
01:24:35,049 --> 01:24:37,028
Don't tell me about my world.
1282
01:24:37,036 --> 01:24:39,095
You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town.
1283
01:24:40,003 --> 01:24:42,083
Then you're gonna go off to Stanford. You're gonna marry some rich prick...
1284
01:24:42,095 --> 01:24:44,083
who your parents will approve of...
1285
01:24:44,091 --> 01:24:46,091
and just sit around with the other trust fund babies...
1286
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,083
and talk about how you went slumming, too, once.
1287
01:24:49,087 --> 01:24:54,029
Why are you saying this? What is your obsession with this money?
1288
01:24:54,073 --> 01:24:59,024
My father died when I was 13, and I inherited this money.
1289
01:24:59,036 --> 01:25:04,074
You don't think every day I wake up, and I wish I could give it back.
1290
01:25:04,079 --> 01:25:06,062
That I would give it back in a second if it meant
1291
01:25:06,062 --> 01:25:08,046
I could have one more day with him.
1292
01:25:08,054 --> 01:25:11,092
But I can't, and that's my life, and I deal with it.
1293
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,088
So don't put your shit on me when you're the one that's afraid.
1294
01:25:15,092 --> 01:25:17,088
I'm afraid? What am I afraid of? What the fuck am I afraid of?
1295
01:25:17,097 --> 01:25:20,047
You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back.
1296
01:25:20,059 --> 01:25:22,072
You know what? I'm afraid too.
1297
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:25,093
But fuck it, I want to give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
1298
01:25:26,001 --> 01:25:27,084
I'm not honest with you?
1299
01:25:27,084 --> 01:25:29,085
No, what about your 12 brothers?
1300
01:25:29,094 --> 01:25:32,023
All right.
1301
01:25:32,031 --> 01:25:34,052
No, you're not going. You're not leaving.
1302
01:25:34,052 --> 01:25:37,037
What do you want to know? That I don't have 12 brothers?
1303
01:25:37,038 --> 01:25:38,065
That I'm a fucking orphan?
1304
01:25:38,074 --> 01:25:40,074
- You don't want to hear that.  - I didn't know that.
1305
01:25:40,082 --> 01:25:44,007
You don't want to hear I got fucking cigarettes put out on me when I was little.
1306
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:46,058
- I didn't know that.  - That this isn't fucking surgery.
1307
01:25:46,066 --> 01:25:49,058
The motherfucker stabbed me. You don't want to hear that shit, Skylar!
1308
01:25:49,066 --> 01:25:51,092
- I do want to hear that.  - Don't tell me you want that shit!
1309
01:25:51,096 --> 01:25:55,021
- I want to help you.  - Help me? What the fuck?
1310
01:25:55,025 --> 01:25:58,001
What do I got, a fucking sign on my back that says, "Save me"?
1311
01:25:58,005 --> 01:26:00,001
- No.  - Do I look like I need that?
1312
01:26:00,009 --> 01:26:02,005
- No, I just want to be with you...  - Don't bullshit me!
1313
01:26:02,018 --> 01:26:06,018
- I love you.  - Don't bullshit me! Don't you fucking bullshit me!
1314
01:26:06,022 --> 01:26:09,018
I love you.
1315
01:26:09,027 --> 01:26:14,027
I want to hear you say that you don't love me.
1316
01:26:14,027 --> 01:26:18,040
Because if you say that...
1317
01:26:18,057 --> 01:26:21,095
then I won't call you...
1318
01:26:21,099 --> 01:26:26,008
and I won't be in your life.
1319
01:26:29,091 --> 01:26:32,066
I don't love you.
1320
01:27:13,062 --> 01:27:17,084
Most people never get to see how brilliant they can be.
1321
01:27:17,088 --> 01:27:20,071
They don't find teachers that believe in them.
1322
01:27:20,071 --> 01:27:24,030
They get convinced they're stupid.
1323
01:27:24,047 --> 01:27:27,043
I hope you appreciate what he's doing,
1324
01:27:27,055 --> 01:27:30,076
because I've seen how much he enjoys working with you,
1325
01:27:30,093 --> 01:27:33,085
not against you.
1326
01:27:37,006 --> 01:27:39,073
Hello, Will.
1327
01:27:39,077 --> 01:27:42,003
Tom, can you get us some coffee?
1328
01:27:42,011 --> 01:27:44,003
Sure.
1329
01:27:47,057 --> 01:27:50,070
Now, let's see.
1330
01:27:55,066 --> 01:27:58,088
Good. This is correct.
1331
01:28:00,034 --> 01:28:02,076
I see you used Maclaurin here.
1332
01:28:02,084 --> 01:28:05,088
Yeah, I don't know what you call it, but...
1333
01:28:05,097 --> 01:28:10,026
This can't be right.
1334
01:28:11,031 --> 01:28:14,022
This would be very embarrassing.
1335
01:28:17,023 --> 01:28:20,027
- Did you ever consider...  - I'm pretty sure it's right.
1336
01:28:20,036 --> 01:28:22,057
Hey, look, can we do this at Sean's office from now on?
1337
01:28:22,057 --> 01:28:26,074
Because I got to knock off work to come here and the commute is killing me.
1338
01:28:26,074 --> 01:28:30,045
- Yeah, sure. Did you think of the possibility...  - That's right.
1339
01:28:30,053 --> 01:28:35,075
It's right. Just take it home with you.
1340
01:28:38,092 --> 01:28:40,083
What happened at the McNeil meeting?
1341
01:28:40,096 --> 01:28:42,092
I couldn't go. I had a date.
1342
01:28:42,092 --> 01:28:46,009
So I sent my chief negotiator.
1343
01:28:49,093 --> 01:28:53,064
On your own time, you can do whatever you like, Will.
1344
01:28:53,072 --> 01:28:56,035
But when I set up a meeting with my associates,
1345
01:28:56,039 --> 01:28:59,010
and you don't show up, it reflects poorly on me.
1346
01:28:59,014 --> 01:29:01,036
- Then don't set up any more meetings.  - I won't.
1347
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:03,086
I'll cancel them.
1348
01:29:03,094 --> 01:29:07,049
I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.
1349
01:29:07,065 --> 01:29:10,074
Maybe I don't want to spend the rest of my fucking life explaining shit to people.
1350
01:29:17,083 --> 01:29:20,021
I think you could show me some appreciation.
1351
01:29:20,033 --> 01:29:24,067
A little appreciation? Do you know how easy this is for me?
1352
01:29:24,084 --> 01:29:28,005
Do you have any fucking idea how easy this is? This is a fucking joke.
1353
01:29:28,022 --> 01:29:30,030
I'm sorry you can't do this... I really am...
1354
01:29:30,038 --> 01:29:35,048
Because I wouldn't have to fuckin' sit here and watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
1355
01:29:39,031 --> 01:29:42,094
Then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk instead, wouldn't you?
1356
01:29:43,002 --> 01:29:47,061
You're right. This is probably a total waste of my time.
1357
01:30:01,067 --> 01:30:03,083
You're right, Will.
1358
01:30:06,009 --> 01:30:10,063
I can't do this proof, but you can.
1359
01:30:10,076 --> 01:30:12,012
And when it comes to that,
1360
01:30:12,012 --> 01:30:14,085
it's only about just a handful of people in the world...
1361
01:30:14,089 --> 01:30:17,001
who can tell the difference between you and me.
1362
01:30:17,006 --> 01:30:19,035
- But I'm one of them.  - Sorry.
1363
01:30:19,043 --> 01:30:21,052
Yeah, so am l.
1364
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:26,073
Most days I wish I never met you,
1365
01:30:26,077 --> 01:30:29,040
because then I could sleep at night.
1366
01:30:29,044 --> 01:30:32,020
I didn't have to walk around with the knowledge
1367
01:30:32,020 --> 01:30:35,037
that there was someone like you out there.
1368
01:30:41,075 --> 01:30:46,021
I didn't have to watch you throw it all away.
1369
01:30:52,026 --> 01:30:57,072
Bill, hold it. Did you hear that?
1370
01:30:57,076 --> 01:30:59,072
Morgan!
1371
01:30:59,077 --> 01:31:03,086
If you're watching pornos in my mom's room again,
1372
01:31:03,086 --> 01:31:05,023
I'm gonna give you a fucking beating!
1373
01:31:21,012 --> 01:31:24,021
What's up, fellas?
1374
01:31:24,033 --> 01:31:28,088
Morgan, why don't you jerk off in your own fucking house. That's fucking filthy.
1375
01:31:28,092 --> 01:31:33,009
I don't have a V.C.R. in my house.
1376
01:31:33,017 --> 01:31:35,080
Come on. Not in my glove.
1377
01:31:35,097 --> 01:31:38,030
I didn't use the glove.
1378
01:31:38,039 --> 01:31:41,093
That's my Little League glove.
1379
01:31:42,002 --> 01:31:45,044
What do you want me to do?
1380
01:31:45,048 --> 01:31:47,069
I mean, what's wrong with you?
1381
01:31:47,073 --> 01:31:49,090
You'll hump a baseball glove?
1382
01:31:50,002 --> 01:31:53,011
I... I just used it for cleanup.
1383
01:31:53,024 --> 01:31:56,091
Stop jerking off in my mother's room.
1384
01:31:56,099 --> 01:32:00,012
- Is there another V.C.R. in the house?  - It's just sad, bro.
1385
01:32:01,083 --> 01:32:06,071
So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency?
1386
01:32:06,083 --> 01:32:09,092
Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge.
1387
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,038
You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you wouldn't see anywhere else,
1388
01:32:13,046 --> 01:32:16,005
because we've classified it.
1389
01:32:16,009 --> 01:32:19,085
Superstring theory, chaos math, advanced algorithms.
1390
01:32:19,089 --> 01:32:22,081
Code breaking.
1391
01:32:22,085 --> 01:32:25,073
That's one aspect of what we do.
1392
01:32:25,073 --> 01:32:28,035
Oh, come on. That is what you do.
1393
01:32:28,044 --> 01:32:30,086
You guys handle 80 of the intelligence workload.
1394
01:32:30,098 --> 01:32:33,044
You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.
1395
01:32:33,057 --> 01:32:39,028
We don't like to brag about that, Will, but you're exactly right.
1396
01:32:39,036 --> 01:32:43,024
So the way I see it, the question isn't:
1397
01:32:43,037 --> 01:32:46,000
"Why should you work for the N.S.A.?"
1398
01:32:46,008 --> 01:32:48,054
The question is: "Why shouldn't you?"
1399
01:32:48,062 --> 01:32:52,050
Why shouldn't I work for the N.S.A.?
1400
01:32:52,059 --> 01:32:56,055
That's a tough one, but I'll take a shot.
1401
01:32:56,059 --> 01:32:59,034
Say I'm working at the N.S.A. and somebody puts a code on my desk.
1402
01:32:59,038 --> 01:33:01,035
Something no one else can break.
1403
01:33:01,043 --> 01:33:03,035
Maybe I take a shot at it and maybe I break it.
1404
01:33:03,039 --> 01:33:05,093
I'm real happy with myself because I did my job well.
1405
01:33:06,002 --> 01:33:07,027
But maybe that code was the location
1406
01:33:07,027 --> 01:33:09,060
of some rebel army in North Africa or Middle East.
1407
01:33:09,065 --> 01:33:12,073
Once they have that location, they bomb the village where the rebels are hiding.
1408
01:33:12,077 --> 01:33:13,088
Fifteen hundred people that I never met,
1409
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:16,099
never had no problem with, get killed.
1410
01:33:17,011 --> 01:33:20,007
Now the politicians are saying, "Send in the Marines to secure the area,"
1411
01:33:20,007 --> 01:33:21,099
because they don't give a shit.
1412
01:33:22,012 --> 01:33:24,003
It won't be their kid over there getting shot,
1413
01:33:24,008 --> 01:33:25,034
just like it wasn't them when their number got called
1414
01:33:25,034 --> 01:33:27,004
because they were in the National Guard.
1415
01:33:27,016 --> 01:33:30,008
It'll be some kid from Southie over there taking shrapnel in the ass.
1416
01:33:30,012 --> 01:33:32,008
He comes back to find the plant he used to work at...
1417
01:33:32,017 --> 01:33:34,067
got exported to the country he got back from,
1418
01:33:34,071 --> 01:33:37,009
and the guy who put the shrapnel in his ass got his old job...
1419
01:33:37,009 --> 01:33:39,097
because he'll work for 15 cents a day and no bathroom breaks.
1420
01:33:40,005 --> 01:33:42,064
Meanwhile, he realizes the only reason he was over there in the first place...
1421
01:33:42,072 --> 01:33:45,085
was so we could install a government that would sell us oil at a good price.
1422
01:33:45,089 --> 01:33:47,024
Of course, the oil companies used
1423
01:33:47,024 --> 01:33:49,094
a skirmish over there to scare up domestic oil prices.
1424
01:33:50,002 --> 01:33:51,046
A cute little ancillary benefit for them,
1425
01:33:51,046 --> 01:33:54,011
but it are'nt helping my buddy at 2.50 a gallon.
1426
01:33:54,019 --> 01:33:56,057
They're taking their sweet time bringing the oil, of course.
1427
01:33:56,057 --> 01:33:58,069
Maybe they even took the liberty to hire an alcoholic skipper,
1428
01:33:58,082 --> 01:34:01,099
who likes to drink martinis and fucking play slalom with the icebergs.
1429
01:34:02,007 --> 01:34:04,032
It are'nt too long till he hits one, spills the oil...
1430
01:34:04,041 --> 01:34:06,087
and kills all the sea life in the North Atlantic.
1431
01:34:06,087 --> 01:34:09,029
So now my buddy's out of work, he can't afford to drive,
1432
01:34:09,029 --> 01:34:11,025
so he's walking to the fucking job interviews...
1433
01:34:11,029 --> 01:34:14,004
which sucks because the shrapnel in his ass is giving him chronic hemorrhoids.
1434
01:34:14,013 --> 01:34:16,071
Meanwhile, he's starving, because every time he tries to get a bite to eat,
1435
01:34:16,075 --> 01:34:18,071
the only blue plate special they're serving...
1436
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:21,068
is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State.
1437
01:34:21,076 --> 01:34:26,081
So what did I think? I'm holding out for something better.
1438
01:34:26,085 --> 01:34:30,068
I figure, fuck it. While I'm at it, why not just shoot my buddy,
1439
01:34:30,073 --> 01:34:32,069
take his job, give it to his sworn enemy,
1440
01:34:32,077 --> 01:34:35,027
hike up gas prices, bomb a village, club a baby seal,
1441
01:34:35,036 --> 01:34:38,003
hit the hash pipe and join the National Guard?
1442
01:34:38,007 --> 01:34:40,065
I can be elected president.
1443
01:34:40,069 --> 01:34:43,099
- You feel like you're alone?  - What?
1444
01:34:44,007 --> 01:34:47,070
Do you have a soul mate?
1445
01:34:47,079 --> 01:34:50,029
Do I have a... Define that.
1446
01:34:50,037 --> 01:34:52,029
Somebody who challenges you.
1447
01:34:52,037 --> 01:34:53,058
Uh, Chuckie.
1448
01:34:53,058 --> 01:34:55,073
No, Chuckie's family.
1449
01:34:55,073 --> 01:34:58,025
He'd lie down in fucking traffic for you.
1450
01:34:58,034 --> 01:35:03,093
I'm talking about someone who opens up things for you, touches your soul.
1451
01:35:04,005 --> 01:35:07,026
- I got... I got...  - Who?
1452
01:35:07,030 --> 01:35:10,039
- I got plenty.  - Well, name them.
1453
01:35:10,043 --> 01:35:11,098
Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Frost,
1454
01:35:11,098 --> 01:35:13,044
O'Connor, Kant, Pope, Locke...
1455
01:35:13,048 --> 01:35:15,073
That's great. They're all dead.
1456
01:35:15,085 --> 01:35:18,098
- Not to me they're not.  - You don't have a lot of dialogue with them.
1457
01:35:19,002 --> 01:35:22,040
You can't give back to them, Will.
1458
01:35:22,049 --> 01:35:24,043
Not without some serious smelling salts and a heater.
1459
01:35:24,043 --> 01:35:26,082
That's what I'm saying.
1460
01:35:26,091 --> 01:35:30,045
You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world...
1461
01:35:30,054 --> 01:35:33,000
where you're always afraid to take the first step,
1462
01:35:33,004 --> 01:35:36,088
because all you see is every negative thing ten miles down the road.
1463
01:35:36,092 --> 01:35:38,092
- You gonna take the professor's side on this?  - Don't give me a line of shit.
1464
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,096
- No.  - I didn't want the job.
1465
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,001
It's not about the job. I don't care if you work for the government.
1466
01:35:43,005 --> 01:35:46,018
But you can do anything you want. You are bound by nothing.
1467
01:35:46,030 --> 01:35:51,035
What are you passionate about? What do you want?
1468
01:35:51,039 --> 01:35:53,068
There are guys who work their entire life laying brick...
1469
01:35:53,081 --> 01:35:56,006
so their kids have a chance at the opportunities you have here.
1470
01:35:56,015 --> 01:35:58,069
- I didn't ask for this.  - No.
1471
01:35:58,073 --> 01:35:59,091
You were born with it,
1472
01:35:59,091 --> 01:36:01,019
so don't cop out behind: "I didn't ask for this."
1473
01:36:01,028 --> 01:36:04,099
- What do you mean, cop out? What's wrong with laying brick?  - Nothing.
1474
01:36:05,011 --> 01:36:07,041
There's nothing wrong. That's somebody's home I'm building.
1475
01:36:07,049 --> 01:36:10,037
Right. My dad laid brick, okay?
1476
01:36:10,045 --> 01:36:12,033
Busted his ass so I could have an education.
1477
01:36:12,041 --> 01:36:14,058
Exactly. That's an honorable profession.
1478
01:36:14,071 --> 01:36:16,062
What's wrong with fixing somebody's car?
1479
01:36:16,067 --> 01:36:18,063
Someone will get to work the next day because of me. That's honor in that.
1480
01:36:18,071 --> 01:36:20,067
Yeah, there is, Will. There is honor in that.
1481
01:36:20,071 --> 01:36:23,005
There's honor in taking that 40-minute train ride...
1482
01:36:23,009 --> 01:36:25,055
so those college kids could come in in the morning and their floors are clean.
1483
01:36:25,067 --> 01:36:28,068
- And their wastebaskets are empty. That's real work.  - That's right.
1484
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:31,076
And that's honorable. I'm sure that's why you took that job.
1485
01:36:31,085 --> 01:36:33,085
I mean, for the honor of it.
1486
01:36:33,093 --> 01:36:38,056
I just have a little question here. You could be a janitor anywhere.
1487
01:36:38,065 --> 01:36:39,071
Why did you work
1488
01:36:39,071 --> 01:36:42,036
at the most prestigious technical college in the whole fucking world?
1489
01:36:42,048 --> 01:36:45,069
Why did you sneak around at night and finish other people's formulas...
1490
01:36:45,074 --> 01:36:51,074
that only one or two people in the world could do and then lie about it?
1491
01:36:51,078 --> 01:36:54,075
because I don't se a lot of honor in that, Will.
1492
01:36:57,092 --> 01:37:00,058
So what do you really wanna do?
1493
01:37:03,092 --> 01:37:06,001
I wanna be a shepherd.
1494
01:37:06,005 --> 01:37:07,093
Really?
1495
01:37:07,097 --> 01:37:10,023
I wanna move up to Nashua, get a nice little spread,
1496
01:37:10,023 --> 01:37:11,093
get some sheep and tend to them.
1497
01:37:12,010 --> 01:37:14,089
- Maybe you should go do that.  - What?
1498
01:37:15,006 --> 01:37:16,027
You know, if you're gonna jerk off,
1499
01:37:16,027 --> 01:37:18,002
why don't you just do it at home with a moist towel?
1500
01:37:18,002 --> 01:37:20,006
- You're chucking me?  - Yeah, get the fuck outta here.
1501
01:37:20,010 --> 01:37:22,002
- No, no, no, time's not up yet.  - Yeah, it is.
1502
01:37:22,015 --> 01:37:22,099
I'm not leaving. No.
1503
01:37:22,099 --> 01:37:24,078
You're not gonna answer, you're wasting my time.
1504
01:37:24,086 --> 01:37:26,082
I thought we were friends.
1505
01:37:26,086 --> 01:37:30,049
- Playtime's over, okay?  - Why are you kicking me out?
1506
01:37:30,057 --> 01:37:33,091
You're lecturing me on life? Look at you, you fucking burnout.
1507
01:37:33,099 --> 01:37:36,020
- What winds your clock?  - Working with you.
1508
01:37:36,029 --> 01:37:37,065
Where's your soul mate?
1509
01:37:37,065 --> 01:37:39,042
You wanna talk about soul mates? Where is she?
1510
01:37:39,046 --> 01:37:41,063
- Dead.  - That's right. She's fucking dead.
1511
01:37:41,067 --> 01:37:44,042
She fucking dies and you just cash in your chips and you walk away?
1512
01:37:44,046 --> 01:37:46,046
At least I played a hand.
1513
01:37:46,046 --> 01:37:48,067
You played a hand and you lost. You lost a big fucking hand.
1514
01:37:48,072 --> 01:37:52,014
Some people will lose a big hand like that and have the sack to ante up again.
1515
01:37:52,018 --> 01:37:55,035
Look at me. What do you wanna do?
1516
01:38:02,023 --> 01:38:06,048
You and your bullshit. You got a bullshit answer for everybody.
1517
01:38:06,057 --> 01:38:10,024
But I ask you a very simple question and you can't give me a straight answer,
1518
01:38:10,036 --> 01:38:14,032
because you don't know.
1519
01:38:15,099 --> 01:38:18,020
I'll see ya, Bo-peep.
1520
01:38:21,017 --> 01:38:23,029
- Fuck you.  - You're the shepherd.
1521
01:38:28,005 --> 01:38:30,026
Shepherd.
1522
01:38:30,038 --> 01:38:32,047
White little prick.
1523
01:38:33,068 --> 01:38:35,064
I just wanted to, you know, um,
1524
01:38:35,064 --> 01:38:39,022
call you up, uh, before you left, um...
1525
01:38:39,027 --> 01:38:41,089
I've been taking all these jobs interviews and stuff,
1526
01:38:41,094 --> 01:38:43,094
so I'm not gonna be just a construction worker.
1527
01:38:43,098 --> 01:38:46,073
Well, you know, I never really cared about that.
1528
01:38:48,019 --> 01:38:50,011
Yeah.
1529
01:38:52,070 --> 01:38:54,070
I love you.
1530
01:38:58,099 --> 01:39:01,050
Will?
1531
01:39:01,058 --> 01:39:04,042
You take care.
1532
01:39:08,013 --> 01:39:10,076
Bye.
1533
01:40:15,028 --> 01:40:17,095
Will
1534
01:40:20,003 --> 01:40:22,020
Will, that's it! We're done!
1535
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:26,096
I'm sitting in your office and the boy isn't here.
1536
01:40:27,004 --> 01:40:29,004
Well, it's ten past 5:00.
1537
01:40:29,013 --> 01:40:31,017
An hour and ten minutes late.
1538
01:40:34,063 --> 01:40:38,014
Well, if he doesn't show up and I file a report saying he wasn't here...
1539
01:40:38,022 --> 01:40:42,014
and he goes back to jail, he won't be on my conscience.
1540
01:40:45,006 --> 01:40:48,010
Okay. Fine.
1541
01:40:49,065 --> 01:40:52,040
What's up?
1542
01:40:53,053 --> 01:40:55,044
Thanks.
1543
01:40:58,011 --> 01:41:02,003
Ah! God, that's good.
1544
01:41:05,079 --> 01:41:08,033
So how's your lady?
1545
01:41:08,033 --> 01:41:11,017
Ah, she's gone.
1546
01:41:11,029 --> 01:41:13,059
Gone? Gone where?
1547
01:41:13,063 --> 01:41:17,038
Med school. Medical school in California.
1548
01:41:17,042 --> 01:41:19,030
- Really?  - Yeah.
1549
01:41:19,047 --> 01:41:22,043
- When was this?  - It was, like, a week ago.
1550
01:41:26,077 --> 01:41:28,069
That sucks.
1551
01:41:31,069 --> 01:41:35,019
So, uh, when are you done with those meetings?
1552
01:41:35,028 --> 01:41:37,032
I think the week after I'm 21.
1553
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:40,007
They gonna hook ya up with a job or what?
1554
01:41:40,020 --> 01:41:44,041
Yeah, fucking sit in a room and do long division for the next 50 years.
1555
01:41:44,049 --> 01:41:48,000
Nah, probably make some nice bank though.
1556
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,096
I'm gonna be a fucking lab rat.
1557
01:41:50,008 --> 01:41:53,038
Better than this shit. Way outta here.
1558
01:41:53,042 --> 01:41:55,067
What do I want a way outta here for?
1559
01:41:55,075 --> 01:41:58,005
I mean, I'm gonna fucking live here the rest of my life.
1560
01:41:58,009 --> 01:42:00,018
You know, be neighbors. You know, have little kids.
1561
01:42:00,026 --> 01:42:04,085
Fucking take them to Little League together up Foley Field.
1562
01:42:06,043 --> 01:42:09,081
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way.
1563
01:42:09,089 --> 01:42:12,077
But in 20 years if you're still living here,
1564
01:42:12,077 --> 01:42:16,011
coming over to my house to watch the Patriots games,
1565
01:42:16,019 --> 01:42:18,049
still working construction, I'll fucking kill ya.
1566
01:42:18,061 --> 01:42:21,011
That's not a threat. That's a fact. I'll fucking kill ya.
1567
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:23,037
What the fuck are you talking about?
1568
01:42:23,045 --> 01:42:26,062
- Look, you got something none of us have.  - Oh, come on!
1569
01:42:26,070 --> 01:42:30,058
Why is it always this? I fucking owe it to myself to do this or that.
1570
01:42:30,075 --> 01:42:32,052
What if I don't want to?
1571
01:42:32,052 --> 01:42:34,079
No, no, no. Fuck you. You don't owe it to yourself.
1572
01:42:34,092 --> 01:42:37,009
You owe it to me,
1573
01:42:37,013 --> 01:42:39,080
because tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be 50,
1574
01:42:39,088 --> 01:42:42,030
and I'll still be doing this shit.
1575
01:42:42,034 --> 01:42:44,093
That's all right. That's fine.
1576
01:42:45,005 --> 01:42:47,060
I mean, you're sitting on a winning lottery ticket.
1577
01:42:47,068 --> 01:42:51,035
You're too much of a pussy to cash it in, and that's bullshit.
1578
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:56,027
because I'd do fucking anything to have what you got.
1579
01:42:56,036 --> 01:42:59,032
So would any of these fucking guys.
1580
01:42:59,036 --> 01:43:01,099
Be an insult to us if you're still here in 20 years.
1581
01:43:02,007 --> 01:43:04,057
Hanging around here is a fucking waste of your time.
1582
01:43:04,070 --> 01:43:06,083
- You don't know that.  - I don't?
1583
01:43:06,091 --> 01:43:07,096
No. You don't know that.
1584
01:43:07,096 --> 01:43:10,041
Oh, I don't know that. Let me tell you what I do know.
1585
01:43:10,045 --> 01:43:14,033
Every day I come by your house, and I pick you up.
1586
01:43:14,037 --> 01:43:18,042
We go out and have a few drinks and few laughs, and it's great.
1587
01:43:18,046 --> 01:43:21,017
You know what the best part of my day is?
1588
01:43:21,022 --> 01:43:22,054
It's for about ten seconds:
1589
01:43:22,054 --> 01:43:25,064
from when I pull up to the curb and when I get to your door.
1590
01:43:25,076 --> 01:43:28,036
because I think maybe I'll get up there
1591
01:43:28,036 --> 01:43:30,039
and I'll knock on the door and you won't be there.
1592
01:43:30,043 --> 01:43:32,051
No "good-bye," no "see ya later."
1593
01:43:32,051 --> 01:43:33,098
No nothing. You just left.
1594
01:43:33,098 --> 01:43:38,032
I don't know much, but I know that.
1595
01:43:50,070 --> 01:43:53,021
This is a disaster, Sean.
1596
01:43:53,029 --> 01:43:55,062
I brought you in here because I wanted you to help me with the boy,
1597
01:43:55,062 --> 01:43:57,067
- not to run him out.  - I know what I'm doing with the boy.
1598
01:43:57,079 --> 01:43:59,071
I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy!
1599
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:02,046
I don't care if you have a few laughs, even at my expense.
1600
01:44:02,046 --> 01:44:05,026
- But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.  - Undermine?
1601
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:07,039
This boy is at a fragile point right now.
1602
01:44:07,051 --> 01:44:10,047
I do understand. He is at a fragile point. He's got problems.
1603
01:44:10,051 --> 01:44:14,010
What problems does he have? That he's better off as a janitor, in jail?
1604
01:44:14,018 --> 01:44:17,027
Better hanging out with a bunch of retarded gorillas?
1605
01:44:17,035 --> 01:44:21,032
Why do you think he does that? You have any fucking clue why?
1606
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:23,065
He can handle the problems. He can handle the work.
1607
01:44:23,066 --> 01:44:24,095
He obviously handled you.
1608
01:44:25,007 --> 01:44:27,057
Listen to me. Why is he hiding?
1609
01:44:27,066 --> 01:44:29,058
Why doesn't he trust anybody?
1610
01:44:29,066 --> 01:44:31,054
Because the first thing that happened to him,
1611
01:44:31,066 --> 01:44:33,058
he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most.
1612
01:44:33,070 --> 01:44:35,066
Don't give me that Freudian crap.
1613
01:44:35,079 --> 01:44:38,013
Why does he hang out with those retarded gorillas, as you call them?
1614
01:44:38,013 --> 01:44:41,075
Because any one of them, if he asked them to, would take a bat to your head.
1615
01:44:41,084 --> 01:44:44,076
- That's called loyalty.  - Yeah, that's very touching.
1616
01:44:44,084 --> 01:44:45,080
Who's he handling?
1617
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:48,001
He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him.
1618
01:44:48,005 --> 01:44:50,060
It's a defense mechanism, all right?
1619
01:44:50,068 --> 01:44:53,039
For 20 years, he's been alone because of that.
1620
01:44:53,047 --> 01:44:56,019
If you push him right now, it's gonna be the same thing all over again.
1621
01:44:56,019 --> 01:44:58,015
I'm not gonna let that happen to him.
1622
01:44:58,027 --> 01:45:00,019
- Don't you do that.  - What?
1623
01:45:00,023 --> 01:45:02,051
Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit,
1624
01:45:02,051 --> 01:45:04,003
that it's okay to be a failure.
1625
01:45:04,007 --> 01:45:06,003
Because it's not okay, Sean!
1626
01:45:06,007 --> 01:45:08,030
And if you're angry at me for being successful,
1627
01:45:08,030 --> 01:45:09,087
for being what you could have been...
1628
01:45:09,095 --> 01:45:12,074
- I'm not angry at you.  - Oh, yes, you're angry at me.
1629
01:45:12,087 --> 01:45:16,096
You resent me, but I'm not gonna apologize for any success I've had.
1630
01:45:17,008 --> 01:45:19,088
You're angry at me for doing what you could have done!
1631
01:45:19,092 --> 01:45:22,000
But ask yourself, Sean... Ask yourself...
1632
01:45:22,004 --> 01:45:24,002
if you want Will to feel that way...
1633
01:45:24,002 --> 01:45:25,051
if you want him to feel like a failure?
1634
01:45:25,063 --> 01:45:27,059
You arrogant shit!
1635
01:45:27,072 --> 01:45:30,001
That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions,
1636
01:45:30,001 --> 01:45:32,010
because I can't stand that look in your eye.
1637
01:45:32,026 --> 01:45:35,022
- That condescending, embarrassed look.  - Oh, come on, Sean.
1638
01:45:35,035 --> 01:45:37,031
You think I'm a failure. I know who I am.
1639
01:45:37,043 --> 01:45:39,037
I'm proud of what I do.
1640
01:45:39,037 --> 01:45:41,090
It was a conscious choice. I didn't fuck up!
1641
01:45:41,098 --> 01:45:44,078
And you and your cronies think I'm some sort of pity case.
1642
01:45:44,078 --> 01:45:46,059
You and your kiss-ass chorus following
1643
01:45:46,059 --> 01:45:48,040
you around going, "The Field's medal!"
1644
01:45:48,045 --> 01:45:51,087
Why are you still so fucking afraid of failure?
1645
01:45:51,091 --> 01:45:54,009
It's about my medal, isn't it? Oh, God,
1646
01:45:54,009 --> 01:45:55,099
I could go home and get it for you. You can have it.
1647
01:45:56,008 --> 01:45:59,004
Shove the medal up your fucking ass, all right?
1648
01:45:59,012 --> 01:46:01,013
because I don't give a shit about your medal,
1649
01:46:01,025 --> 01:46:03,017
because I knew you before you were a mathematical god,
1650
01:46:03,025 --> 01:46:05,013
when you were pimple-faced and homesick
1651
01:46:05,013 --> 01:46:06,088
and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on.
1652
01:46:06,092 --> 01:46:08,092
Yeah, you were smarter than me then and you're smarter than me now.
1653
01:46:09,001 --> 01:46:11,001
So don't blame me for how your life turned out.
1654
01:46:11,001 --> 01:46:13,043
I don't blame you! It's not about you!
1655
01:46:13,047 --> 01:46:16,027
You mathematical dick! It's about the boy!
1656
01:46:16,031 --> 01:46:17,091
He's a good kid!
1657
01:46:17,091 --> 01:46:21,031
And I won't see you fuck him up like you're trying to fuck up me right now.
1658
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:23,090
I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
1659
01:46:23,098 --> 01:46:25,018
He won't be a failure!
1660
01:46:25,018 --> 01:46:27,044
But if you push him! If you ride him!
1661
01:46:27,053 --> 01:46:33,016
I am what I am today because I was pushed and because I learned to push myself.
1662
01:46:33,024 --> 01:46:35,033
He's not you! You get that!
1663
01:46:37,049 --> 01:46:39,025
I can come back.
1664
01:46:39,037 --> 01:46:43,042
No, come in. Uh, I was just leaving.
1665
01:46:53,068 --> 01:46:57,064
A lot of that stuff goes back a long way between me and him.
1666
01:46:57,064 --> 01:46:59,073
You know. Not about you.
1667
01:47:04,095 --> 01:47:06,048
What is that?
1668
01:47:06,052 --> 01:47:10,086
This is your file. I have to send it back to the judge for evaluation.
1669
01:47:10,090 --> 01:47:16,008
Oh. Hey, you're not gonna fail me, are you?
1670
01:47:19,075 --> 01:47:22,000
What's it say?
1671
01:47:23,033 --> 01:47:26,000
- Wanna read it?  - Why?
1672
01:47:27,071 --> 01:47:30,092
Have you had any, uh, experience with that?
1673
01:47:31,005 --> 01:47:34,059
Twenty years of counseling. Yeah, I've seen some pretty awful shit.
1674
01:47:34,068 --> 01:47:39,001
I mean, have you had any experience with that?
1675
01:47:42,098 --> 01:47:46,052
- Personally?  - Yeah.
1676
01:47:46,056 --> 01:47:48,048
Yeah, I have.
1677
01:47:48,061 --> 01:47:50,057
It sure are'nt good.
1678
01:47:54,007 --> 01:47:56,020
My father was an alcoholic.
1679
01:47:56,024 --> 01:47:59,008
Mean fucking drunk.
1680
01:48:00,070 --> 01:48:03,075
He'd come home hammered, looking to whale on somebody.
1681
01:48:03,075 --> 01:48:08,029
So I'd provoke him so he wouldn't go after my mother and little brother.
1682
01:48:08,038 --> 01:48:12,055
Interesting nights when he wore his rings.
1683
01:48:13,059 --> 01:48:17,001
He used to just put a wrench,
1684
01:48:17,005 --> 01:48:19,093
a stick and a belt on the table.
1685
01:48:20,006 --> 01:48:24,002
- Just say, "Choose."  - Well, I gotta go with the belt there.
1686
01:48:24,010 --> 01:48:26,006
I used to go with the wrench.
1687
01:48:26,010 --> 01:48:28,015
Why the wrench?
1688
01:48:28,019 --> 01:48:30,057
because fuck him, that's why.
1689
01:48:30,061 --> 01:48:34,024
- Your foster father?  - Yeah.
1690
01:48:34,032 --> 01:48:38,020
So, uh, what is it, like, Will has an attachment disorder?
1691
01:48:38,028 --> 01:48:40,058
Is it all that stuff?
1692
01:48:40,066 --> 01:48:43,058
Fear of abandonment?
1693
01:48:43,058 --> 01:48:46,062
Is that why I broke up with Skylar?
1694
01:48:46,079 --> 01:48:50,009
- I didn't know you had.  - Yeah, I did.
1695
01:48:50,013 --> 01:48:54,013
- You wanna talk about it?  - No.
1696
01:48:56,030 --> 01:49:02,014
Hey, Will, I don't know a lot.
1697
01:49:02,026 --> 01:49:05,064
You see this? All this shit?
1698
01:49:10,065 --> 01:49:12,073
It's not your fault.
1699
01:49:15,007 --> 01:49:17,015
Yeah, I know that.
1700
01:49:17,024 --> 01:49:20,024
Look at me, son.
1701
01:49:20,032 --> 01:49:23,083
- It's not your fault.  - I know.
1702
01:49:23,091 --> 01:49:28,054
No. It's not your fault.
1703
01:49:28,062 --> 01:49:30,058
I know.
1704
01:49:30,063 --> 01:49:35,013
No, no, you don't. It's not your fault.
1705
01:49:35,026 --> 01:49:37,017
- Hmm?  - I know.
1706
01:49:37,030 --> 01:49:40,001
- It's not your fault.  - All right.
1707
01:49:40,005 --> 01:49:42,055
It's not your fault.
1708
01:49:44,039 --> 01:49:49,069
- It's not your fault.  - Don't fuck with me.
1709
01:49:49,069 --> 01:49:52,011
It's not your fault.
1710
01:49:52,019 --> 01:49:55,078
Don't fuck with me, all right? Don't fuck with me, Sean, not you.
1711
01:49:55,078 --> 01:49:58,036
It's not your fault.
1712
01:50:05,042 --> 01:50:07,066
It's not your fault.
1713
01:50:13,088 --> 01:50:17,001
My God...
1714
01:50:17,005 --> 01:50:21,072
My God! I'm so sorry! My God!
1715
01:50:35,086 --> 01:50:38,003
Fuck them, okay?
1716
01:52:04,011 --> 01:52:08,016
- Can I help you?  - Yeah, I'm Will Hunting. I'm here about a position.
1717
01:52:08,028 --> 01:52:10,070
Could you just have a seat for a moment?
1718
01:52:14,025 --> 01:52:17,067
Yes, there's a Mr. Hunting in the lobby.
1719
01:52:37,073 --> 01:52:39,073
Which one did you take?
1720
01:52:39,086 --> 01:52:44,082
I was over at McNeil. It's one of the jobs the professor set me up with.
1721
01:52:44,086 --> 01:52:49,024
I haven't told him yet, but I went down there and talked to my boss...
1722
01:52:49,028 --> 01:52:52,070
My new boss. He seemed like a good guy.
1723
01:52:52,083 --> 01:52:58,017
- Is that what you want?  - Yeah, you know, I think so.
1724
01:52:58,029 --> 01:53:01,025
Well, good for you. Congratulations.
1725
01:53:01,038 --> 01:53:03,030
Thanks.
1726
01:53:06,043 --> 01:53:08,026
Time's up.
1727
01:53:11,031 --> 01:53:14,052
So that's... So that's it? So we're done?
1728
01:53:14,060 --> 01:53:17,039
Yeah, that's it.
1729
01:53:17,044 --> 01:53:20,036
You're done. You're a free man.
1730
01:53:21,057 --> 01:53:26,032
Well, um, I just want you to know, Sean, that...
1731
01:53:26,045 --> 01:53:28,036
You're welcome, Will.
1732
01:53:33,058 --> 01:53:36,058
So, you know, I hope we keep in touch, you know.
1733
01:53:36,071 --> 01:53:39,012
Yeah, me too.
1734
01:53:39,021 --> 01:53:41,088
I'll be traveling around a bit. It'll be a little hard, but, uh...
1735
01:53:41,092 --> 01:53:45,063
I've got an answering machine at the college I'll be checking in with.
1736
01:53:45,071 --> 01:53:49,051
So, here's the number.
1737
01:53:49,059 --> 01:53:53,047
You call that. I'll get back to you right away.
1738
01:53:53,051 --> 01:53:56,064
Yeah, you know, I figured I'm just gonna...
1739
01:53:56,068 --> 01:54:01,027
put my money back on the table and see what kind of cards I get.
1740
01:54:02,048 --> 01:54:05,053
You do what's in your heart, son. You'll be fine.
1741
01:54:10,007 --> 01:54:12,016
- Thank you, Sean.  - Uh...
1742
01:54:12,028 --> 01:54:14,033
Thank you, Will.
1743
01:54:16,004 --> 01:54:19,033
Hey, does this violate the patient-doctor relationship?
1744
01:54:19,046 --> 01:54:21,058
Naw. Only if you grab my ass.
1745
01:54:25,038 --> 01:54:27,055
- Take care.  - You too.
1746
01:54:27,072 --> 01:54:29,059
Yeah.
1747
01:54:31,039 --> 01:54:33,039
Hey.
1748
01:54:33,047 --> 01:54:35,085
Good luck, son.
1749
01:54:46,098 --> 01:54:49,074
Two beers.
1750
01:54:52,045 --> 01:54:54,049
What's up? Did you guys go?
1751
01:54:54,058 --> 01:54:56,091
No. I had to talk him down.
1752
01:54:57,004 --> 01:55:00,075
- Why didn't you yoke him?  - Little Morgan's got a lot of scrap to him.
1753
01:55:00,075 --> 01:55:02,071
People try to whip his ass every week.
1754
01:55:02,075 --> 01:55:05,025
- Fucking kid won't back down.  - What are you saying about me?
1755
01:55:05,029 --> 01:55:08,080
Was I talking to you? None of your fucking business.
1756
01:55:08,088 --> 01:55:12,013
- Go get me a beer.  - I ordered two beers!
1757
01:55:12,022 --> 01:55:14,022
- Hey, asshole.  - What, bitch?
1758
01:55:14,026 --> 01:55:18,010
- Happy birthday.  - Thought we forgot, huh, bitch?
1759
01:55:18,018 --> 01:55:20,077
- Come on!  - I'm going. I'm going.
1760
01:55:20,081 --> 01:55:22,069
All right. Who's first?
1761
01:55:22,085 --> 01:55:25,027
- Come on, motherfucker!  - Who's first?
1762
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:27,027
Oh, Danny boy
1763
01:55:27,036 --> 01:55:30,086
Here's your present.
1764
01:55:30,090 --> 01:55:32,095
- Come on, bro.  - What?
1765
01:55:32,099 --> 01:55:37,028
Well, we knew you had to get back and forth to Cambridge for your new job.
1766
01:55:37,037 --> 01:55:41,025
I knew I wasn't gonna fucking drive you every day, so...
1767
01:55:41,029 --> 01:55:45,038
- Morgan wanted to get you a "T" pass.  - That's not what I was saying!
1768
01:55:45,046 --> 01:55:47,088
But, uh, you're 21 now.
1769
01:55:48,005 --> 01:55:49,048
You're legally allowed to drink,
1770
01:55:49,048 --> 01:55:51,063
so we figured the best thing for ya was a car.
1771
01:55:51,063 --> 01:55:54,013
- How do you like it?  - This is like...
1772
01:55:56,055 --> 01:56:00,056
It's the ugliest fucking car I've ever seen in my life.
1773
01:56:00,060 --> 01:56:02,064
- Come on, brother.  - How'd you guys do this?
1774
01:56:02,068 --> 01:56:07,065
You know, me and Bill scraped together the parts,
1775
01:56:07,069 --> 01:56:09,078
and Morgan was out panhandling for change every day.
1776
01:56:09,082 --> 01:56:11,082
I had the router to do all the bodywork.
1777
01:56:11,082 --> 01:56:13,078
Yeah, I have a fucking job, too, brother.
1778
01:56:13,082 --> 01:56:14,094
Guy's been up my ass for two years about a job.
1779
01:56:14,094 --> 01:56:16,028
I had to let him help with the car.
1780
01:56:16,037 --> 01:56:18,045
So you finally got a job, huh, Morgan?
1781
01:56:18,049 --> 01:56:20,066
- Yeah, had one. Now I'm fucked again.  - So what is it?
1782
01:56:20,079 --> 01:56:22,084
A lawn mower? What do ya got?
1783
01:56:22,084 --> 01:56:24,046
It's a straight fucking six.
1784
01:56:24,050 --> 01:56:26,050
Me and Bill rebuilt this engine ourselves here.
1785
01:56:26,050 --> 01:56:29,059
It's a good car. The engine's good. Engine's good.
1786
01:56:29,067 --> 01:56:32,097
- Happy 21, Will.  - Happy 21, brother.
1787
01:56:41,010 --> 01:56:42,010
Hi.
1788
01:56:43,056 --> 01:56:45,056
Come on in.
1789
01:56:47,069 --> 01:56:49,065
Sean, l, um...
1790
01:56:49,069 --> 01:56:52,074
Me too, Gerry.
1791
01:56:52,082 --> 01:56:55,020
Yeah. Good.
1792
01:56:56,024 --> 01:56:58,037
I heard you're taking some time.
1793
01:56:58,045 --> 01:57:03,004
Yeah. Travel a little bit, maybe write.
1794
01:57:03,012 --> 01:57:05,008
So where are you going?
1795
01:57:05,016 --> 01:57:09,017
India and China and Baltimore.
1796
01:57:10,042 --> 01:57:12,050
Oh.
1797
01:57:12,059 --> 01:57:14,055
You know when you'll be back?
1798
01:57:14,067 --> 01:57:18,005
Oh. I got this flyer the other day.
1799
01:57:18,005 --> 01:57:20,093
It says, uh, class of '72 is having a reunion in six months.
1800
01:57:21,006 --> 01:57:22,089
Yeah, I got one of those too.
1801
01:57:23,002 --> 01:57:24,093
Why don't you come? I'll buy ya a drink.
1802
01:57:24,098 --> 01:57:27,090
The drinks at those things are free.
1803
01:57:27,090 --> 01:57:31,044
I know, Gerry. I was being ironical.
1804
01:57:35,082 --> 01:57:39,062
- Oh.  - How about a drink right now?
1805
01:57:39,070 --> 01:57:42,087
Yeah. It's a good idea.
1806
01:57:42,091 --> 01:57:45,029
Come on. This one's on me.
1807
01:57:48,008 --> 01:57:50,038
- I got the winner right here, pal.  - Oh!
1808
01:57:50,050 --> 01:57:53,084
Yes, sir, this is the one.
1809
01:57:53,092 --> 01:57:56,026
This is my ticket to paradise.
1810
01:57:56,030 --> 01:57:58,038
Do you know what the odds are against winning the lottery?
1811
01:57:58,043 --> 01:58:01,047
- What? Four to one?  - About 30 million to one.
1812
01:58:01,051 --> 01:58:03,064
I still have a shot, you know?
1813
01:58:03,081 --> 01:58:08,019
Yes, just about as big chance as you being hit by lightning here
1814
01:58:08,019 --> 01:58:09,065
on the staircase right now.
1815
01:58:09,069 --> 01:58:12,000
It's a possibility too. I mean, 32 million.
1816
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:12,098
If you look at the size...
1817
01:59:42,036 --> 01:59:44,082
Will!
1818
02:00:03,080 --> 02:00:05,072
Will?
1819
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:14,096
He's not there.
1820
02:01:36,002 --> 02:01:39,035
Sean, if the professor calls about that job,
1821
02:01:39,035 --> 02:01:43,094
just tell him sorry, I had to go see about a girl.
1822
02:01:44,003 --> 02:01:45,094
Will.
1823
02:01:47,057 --> 02:01:50,091
Son of a bitch. He stole my line.
