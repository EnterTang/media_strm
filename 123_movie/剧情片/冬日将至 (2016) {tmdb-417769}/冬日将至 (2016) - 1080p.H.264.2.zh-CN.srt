1
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,310
魔镜显示出什么?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What does the Mirror show you?

2
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,770
你看到了什么?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What do you see?

3
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,610
一个古老的童话故事,
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}An oft told tale.

4
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,280
关于白雪公主.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}That of Snow White,

5
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,620
如何战胜巫后莱维娜,
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}how she vanquished the evil Queen Ravenna

6
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,830
夺回原本属于她的王位.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}and took her rightful place on the throne.

7
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:14,550
然而还有一个故事, 一个不为人知的故事.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}But there is another story, one you have not yet seen.

8
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:21,220
那是发生在"美满结局"之前的故事.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}One that comes long before "happily ever after. "

9
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,300
就凭一个小卒?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}A mere pawn?

10
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,350
一个小卒就足以颠覆整个王国.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}A humble pawn can bring down kingdoms.

11
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,900
别让我分神.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Stop distracting me.

12
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,820
可怜的小卒仔.遇上了奸诈的国王.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Poor little pawn. Mean old king.

13
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,030
真是太可怜了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}So sad.

14
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,370
不过最后的生杀大权...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}But the final say...

15
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,330
还是.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Well...

16
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,920
掌握在, 皇后手里.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Queen will have that.

17
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,340
皇后吃了国王.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Queen takes king.

18
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:08,040
你以为我说的 只是这盘棋吗.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And you thought this was just a game.

19
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,280
在魔镜的帮助下,
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}With the Mirror at her command,

20
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,450
莱维娜势不可挡.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Ravenna was invincible.

21
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,260
莱维娜攻破了一个又一个的王国.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}She took her kingdom as she had taken others before it,

22
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,470
她的魔爪还会伸向下一个王国,
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}and as she would take others again,

23
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,010
而她的妹妹, 芙蕾雅, 始终陪伴在她身边
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}with her sister Freya at her side.

24
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:21,990
你爱上他了?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}IS if {\i1}love?{\i}

25
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,570
真的吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Truly?

26
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,660
是的, 我很爱他. 该你了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}It is love, truly. Your move.

27
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,870
我又何必多此一举? 赢的那个总是你.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Why should I bother? You always win.

28
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,750
是你总是让着我.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You always let me win.

29
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,710
对你我总是有千万个不忍心.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I suppose you are my weakness.

30
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,590
那好吧.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Very well.

31
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:48,140
皇后进五吃车. 三步之内将军.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Queen to rook five. Checkmate in three.

32
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,890
吸取教训, 芙蕾雅, 总有一天你会成功的.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Learn from loss, Freya, and your day will come.

33
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,770
一旦你内心的魔力得到释放
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Your possibilities will be endless

34
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,020
你将会拥有无穷无尽的力量.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}once the magic awakens in your heart.

35
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,610
不会的. 你我都很清楚. 我和你不同.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}It won't. We both know it won't. I'm not like you.

36
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,990
我们家族的女人都是天赋异禀的, 芙蕾雅.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}All the women of our blood are gifted, Freya.

37
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,280
总有一天...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And in time

38
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:12,500
你会挖掘出你自己的潜能, 就像我一样.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}you will find the source of your power as I found mine.

39
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,870
或许吧.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}We'll see.

40
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,880
怎么了?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What?

41
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,670
你怀了他的孩子.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You're carrying his child.

42
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,760
哦.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Oh.

43
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,020
你不知道吗.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You didn't know.

44
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,110
可惜.他已经和别人订婚了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Well, he's promised to another.

45
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,610
可他并不爱她.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}He does not love her.

46
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,070
他们的婚约既成事实 谁都无法阻止.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Their engagement is sealed. It cannot be broken.

47
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,280
他不会娶你的.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}He will deny you.

48
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,280
他更不会承认你们的女儿.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And he will deny your daughter.

49
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,750
他不会这么做的.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}He will not.

50
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,910
芙蕾雅.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Freya,

51
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,080
你别怪我残忍.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I'm not being cruel.

52
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,710
我只是单纯的想保护你.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I simply wish to protect you.

53
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,840
我会让你知道 一切并不会像你说的那样.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You may be surprised how things turn out.

54
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,140
你知道的很多, 莱维娜.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You know much, Ravenna.

55
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,430
但并不是所有的事情.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}But you do not know all.

56
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,860
恐怕要让你失望了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I'm afraid I do.

57
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,330
芙蕾雅并不相信他的姊姊.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Freya did not believe her sister,

58
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,710
因为爱情会让人变的盲目.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}for love blinds even the clearest eye.

59
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,500
而就在她女儿诞生数月之际,
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And when her daughter was but a few weeks old,

60
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,840
芙蕾雅的真心终于得到了回报.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Freya's trusting heart was rewarded at last.

61
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
她的心上人写了封信给她.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Her lover had sent word.

62
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:55,390
他选择违抗家族的意愿 和芙雷雅
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}He would defy his family and marry Freya in secret,

63
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,390
在御花园里秘密结婚.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}in the Royal Garden.

64
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,810
他们会带着他们的孩子
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}They would gather their child

65
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,480
逃离这个王国 开始一段属于他们自己的生活.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}and flee the kingdom to begin a life of their own.

66
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,510
芙蕾雅, 别过去.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Freya, don't!

67
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,540
我别无选择.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I had no choice.

68
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,250
我别无选择, 芙蕾雅.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I had no choice, Freya.

69
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,940
悲愤万分的芙蕾雅,
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Consumed by grief and anger,

70
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,490
最终离开了她的姊姊.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Freya left her sister

71
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,950
前往遥远的北方 寻找属于她自己的国度
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}to seek a kingdom of her own in the land far to the north.

72
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:40,290
在那里, 人们无不害怕听到她的名字.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}There, the people would come to fear her very name.

73
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,410
烧了! 杀光他们!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Burn it down! Kill them all!

74
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,250
失去孩子的芙雷雅,
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}For if she could not raise a child,

75
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,050
就在这里
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}then in its place

76
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,550
建立一支属于自己的军队.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}she would raise an army.

77
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:54,930
老实点, 小子!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Come on, boy!

78
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,430
艾力!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Eric!

79
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,890
快跑!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Run!

80
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,600
给我过来
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Come on.

81
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:40,310
芙蕾雅的到来 让原本翠绿的北方大地
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Freya turned the once-green farmlands

82
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:43,890
变成了一片冰雪覆盖的荒芜世界.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}of the north into a frozen wasteland.

83
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:51,940
他建造了自己的堡垒, 成为了冰雪女王.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}There she built her fortress, and ruled as the Ice Queen.

84
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,650
放行!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Charrets!

85
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,220
你们多么的幸运.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}How lucky you are.

86
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,390
有我在你们身边.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You're with me now.

87
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,100
你们就再也不会经历 这样的痛苦了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And you will never know this suffering again.

88
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,410
你在害怕吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You are scared?

89
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,370
不.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}No.

90
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,420
你是不是想念你的父亲?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Is it your father that you miss?

91
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,340
还是你的母亲?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Your mother?

92
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,130
- 是的. - 是吗.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}- Yes.  - Yes.

93
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,920
你叫什么名字.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Tell me your name.

94
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,010
塔尔.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Tull.

95
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,090
塔尔.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Tull.

96
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:52,560
所谓爱 就是个谎言.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Love is a lie.

97
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,280
它是残酷的人
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}It is a trick played by the cruel

98
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,530
用来玩弄愚者和弱者的手段.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}on the foolish and the weak.

99
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,700
把它从脑海中抹去.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Cast it from your mind.

100
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,700
我绝不允许让爱扰乱你们的思绪, .
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Never let it render you frail of mind

101
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,540
削弱你们的意志
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}or of will,

102
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,500
因为在我的王国 只有一条法则:
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}because in my kingdom, there is but one law.

103
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,500
"不准有爱."
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}"Do not love."

104
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,300
爱是种罪孽, 对此我绝不姑息.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}It's a sin, and I'll not forgive it.

105
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,100
好了, 别再提什么家人和爱了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Now, let's hear no more of family and love.

106
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,810
那些假象根本不值一提.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Those illusions are beneath you.

107
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,390
我会让你们摆脱爱的困扰.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I have freed you from them.

108
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,480
而对于这份恩赐. 我只要求你们回报我一件事,
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And in exchange for this precious gift, I ask only one thing,

109
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,360
誓死效忠.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}your loyalty.

110
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,410
你们将接受训练. 你们将变得强大.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You will train. You will harden.

111
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:49,080
你们将成为我的精英, 我的猎人军团.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You will become my elite, my Huntsmen.

112
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,080
从此你们将变得无坚不摧.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And nothing will ever, ever destroy you.

113
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,790
拿好!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Take it!

114
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,000
一. 二. 三.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}One. Two. Three.

115
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,820
出棒!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Strike!

116
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,900
就这样, 孩子们渐渐成为了士兵.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And so children grew to be soldiers,

117
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,860
他们各个训练有素 骁勇善战.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}becoming one with blade and arrow.

118
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,280
准备好弓箭!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Ready your bows!

119
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,660
拉弓!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Draw.

120
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,070
放箭!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Release!

121
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,570
侍卫.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Guard?

122
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,120
那男孩和女孩.他们是谁?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}The boy and the girl, who are they?

123
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,620
叫什么名字?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What are their names?

124
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,460
哪两个?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Which?

125
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,670
最强的那两个.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}The best ones.

126
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,330
艾力和莎拉, 女王陛下.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Eric and Sara, my queen.

127
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,120
我吓到你了吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Did I scare you?

128
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,370
难道你不知道吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Do you not know?

129
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,200
我从不失手.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I never miss.

130
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,580
放行!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Wagons!

131
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,720
新来了一批孩子, 长官.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}The new children, sir.

132
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:57,770
时间差不多了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}It's about time.

133
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,270
到了, 孩子. 来吧, 动作快, 出来. 快点.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You're home, kids. Come on, hurry up.

134
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,940
下车吧 很好 快点.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Get out, come on. That's it.

135
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,020
来吧
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Come on.

136
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,980
去吧孩子
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Go, boy.

137
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:09,690
都出来!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Out!

138
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,030
来吧. 动起来, 快点.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Come on. Move, faster.

139
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,660
嘘
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Psst.

140
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:22,920
你在那干嘛?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What you doing in there?

141
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,920
我知道这里的主人.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I know who lives here.

142
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,970
她太恐怖了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}She scares me.

143
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,340
好吧, 没错.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Ah, right.

144
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:36,180
有时她确实有点暴躁.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Yeah, she can be a wee bit grumpy from time to time.

145
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,520
你知道吗? 我不会让她猜透我在想什么.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Do you know what I do? I just never let her know what I'm thinking.

146
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,940
你是怎么做到的?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}How do you do that?

147
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,400
好吧, 你做个凶恶的表情看看?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Well, can you make a mean face?

148
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,400
还不赖.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}That's not bad.

149
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,230
像这样呢.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What about like this?

150
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,900
这次好多了, 战斗时你就这么做.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}That's better. Now that's your war face.

151
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,160
当女王靠近时 你就做出这个表情,
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}If you wear that always when the queen is near,

152
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,200
她就不知道你在想什么了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}she'll never know what you're thinking either.

153
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,450
这样你就没事了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You do that, and you'll be fine.

154
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,080
来吧.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Come on.

155
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,600
女王派她的军队.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}The queen sent her army to wage war

156
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,150
征战北方列国
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}against the great kings of the north.

157
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,150
一场又一场的战争, 猎人军团战无不胜.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Battle after battle, they returned victorious.

158
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,610
可只有幸存者才能活着回来.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Those who were left alive.

159
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,920
你们做得很好, 我的孩子们.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You've done well, my children.

160
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,260
非常出色.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Very well.

161
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,940
你忘了走路绝不能出声.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You forget to walk in shadow.

162
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,290
而你也忘了稳住阵脚.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And you forget your balance.

163
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,270
这是在干嘛?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What are you doing?

164
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,520
看不出来吗, 你个傻小子?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You cannae tell, you daft boy?

165
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,520
我要嫁给你.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I'm marrying you.

166
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,950
这是我妈妈的.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}It was my mother's.

167
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,540
是我唯一的宝贝.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}My only treasure.

168
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,460
以前我为她而活.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I lived for her.

169
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:35,840
现在...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Now...

170
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,170
我要为你而活.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I live for you.

171
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,510
我们要怎么在这里相爱?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}How do we live for each other in this place here?

172
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,720
芙蕾雅只要看我们一眼
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Freya will take one look at us,

173
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,970
就知道, 什么事了?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}and she'll know. And what then?

174
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,020
天一亮.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}It's almost day.

175
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,230
拿上你的东西.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Gather your things.

176
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,980
到院子里等我.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Meet me in the courtyard.

177
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,980
他会抓到我们, 或者不会.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}She'll catch us or she won't.

178
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,440
不论是哪条路..
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}But either way,

179
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,530
我们都会获得自由.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}we shall be free.

180
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,660
你是爱我的, 对不对?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You do love me, don't you?

181
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,960
对, 我爱你.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Aye, I do.

182
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,420
我把我的生死都交给你.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I give you my life and my death.

183
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,670
无论生死, 我都不会离开你身边, 我向你发誓.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Stand or fall, I'll never leave your side, I swear it to you.

184
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,140
我听说过这个故事.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Yes, I know this story.

185
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,390
女孩总是偷偷的
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}The girl goes in secret

186
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,770
去见他的心上人.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}to meet her one true love.

187
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:18,060
我很好奇 这次的结局又会是什么
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I wonder how it ends this time.

188
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,440
你们俩所拥有的一切.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I gave you both everything.

189
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:26,570
到头来, 你们却背叛我.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And in return you betray me.

190
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,490
就为了爱.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}For love.

191
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,580
我们替你争战沙场.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}We fought your wars.

192
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,200
我们做得够多了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}We've done enough.

193
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:36,620
求您了, 女王, 放我们走吧.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Please, my queen, let us go.

194
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,420
别在我面前摇尾乞怜.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Do not beg me!

195
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,250
这是懦弱的表现.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}It is weak.

196
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,590
你们太软弱了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You are weak.

197
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:48,970
你们想离开是吧?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Do you want to leave?

198
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,270
非常好, 那就走到彼此身边.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Very well. Go to each other.

199
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,060
如果你们做到了
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}If you can.

200
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,150
我就答应放你们走.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And I'll let you go.

201
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,860
这应该不会太难.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Shouldn't be too hard.

202
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,990
因为爱能克服一切.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Love conquers all.

203
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,120
所以我听说过.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}So I've heard.

204
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:04,210
别让我再看到他.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Take him out of my sight.

205
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:10,290
很久很久以前, 一对年轻男女陷入爱河.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Once upon a time a man and woman fell in love.

206
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,090
可惜好景不长.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}But such things cannot last.

207
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,550
因为人心是如此地善变.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}For the heart is a treacherous thing.

208
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,470
而爱情...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And love...

209
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,980
爱情只不过是一个童话故事而已.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Love is nothing more than a fairy tale.

210
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,980
日复一日 年复一年.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Days turned to years.

211
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,190
芙蕾雅的王国日益壮大.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Freya's empire continued to rise

212
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,240
与此同时, 猎人
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}while her sister Ravenna's fell

213
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,280
和白雪公主一举拿下了莱维娜.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}at the hands of the Huntsman and Snow White.

214
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:51,500
可总有一股邪恶力量 萦绕着这个国度.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}But some evil cannot truly be vanquished.

215
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:21,690
停下！
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Halt!

216
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:28,950
谁在那里?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Who's there?

217
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,830
展示你自己!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Show yourself!

218
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,000
RAVE N NA; Kill...

219
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,880
杀了我.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Kill for me.

220
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:45,280
不要只是站在那儿,做点什么!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Don't just stand there, do something!

221
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,130
你疯了,老兄.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You're mad, man.

222
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:07,970
Aye, I wanted it an inch higher but the wind is tricky out here.

223
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,930
我们得到了什么?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What have we got?

224
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,640
那很精致
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Well, that is exquisite.

225
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:20,810
哦.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Oops.

226
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,520
你没有权利.我有充分的权力
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You have no right. I have every right.

227
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:24,610
这些是我的地盘
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}These are my woods.

228
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,110
这些都是女王的树林，我有一个皇家许可证.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}These are the queen's woods. I have a royal permit.

229
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:30,240
也许是鹿,但不是小鹿
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}For deer, maybe, but not fawns.

230
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,160
小鹿 只有几周那么大
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}That one there was just a few weeks old.

231
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,870
我的你的营地,发现三个你杀的人
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Like the three others you killed that I found at your camp.

232
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,580
它是美丽的你介意吗?  什么? 不.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}It's beautiful. Do you mind? What? No.

233
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:43,960
放开我的马. 不,不,不
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Release my horse. No,no,no.

234
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,500
我马上给钱
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I'm keeping the horse as payment.

235
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:46,840
给钱是为了什么？
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Payment for what? For the arrow.

236
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,670
它不喜欢他们在树上生长。
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}It's not like they grow on trees.

237
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,510
嗯，他们做的，但是没有尖点有
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Well, technically they do, but not the pointy bit there.

238
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,020
那都是你的
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}That's all yours.

239
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:02,190
你将付款,平民
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You will pay, commoner.

240
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:05,980
我会告诉女王,他将会知道
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I shall tell the queen and the queen will have your head.

241
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:08,690
女王白雪公主吗? 是的.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Queen Snow White? Yes.

242
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,030
白雪公主
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Snow White.

243
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:11,700
Hyah!

244
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:02,910
散开!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Fan out!

245
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,960
一字排开 !
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Line the flanks!

246
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,510
再见了, 亲爱的.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}See you later, love.

247
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,310
国王陛下
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Your Majesty.

248
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:22,310
行了, 我的老友.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Please, my friend.

249
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:26,440
如果这是关于马的，我可以解释。
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}If this is about the horse, I can explain.

250
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,400
马 什么马
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Horse? What horse?

251
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,360
没关系
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Never mind.

252
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,360
你怎么找到我的?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}How'd you find me?

253
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:33,780
花了不少功夫.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}It wasn't easy.

254
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,660
莱恩.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Nion.

255
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,070
- 你答应过我的. - 对, 没错...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}- You sworn.  - Yeah. Well, he...

256
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,910
可他威胁要把我扔进一个锅...一个大锅里.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}he threatened to put me in a big pot.

257
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,660
胡扯. 她拿了我三块金币.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Nonsense. We paid him three gold.

258
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,160
三个? 就这么点?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Oh, three? Is that all?

259
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,410
每人三个.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Three each.

260
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,170
- 你又是谁? - 格里夫.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}- Who are you?  - Gryff.

261
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,460
竭诚为您效劳.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}At your service.

262
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,630
放债, 收钱, 都可以找我.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Bonds, rewards, debt collection.

263
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,670
- 我是他弟弟. - 他是, 半个弟弟.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}- I'm his brother.  - He, half brother

264
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,170
同一个老妈
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Same mum.

265
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,180
我们去那说.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Walk with me.

266
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,470
我有一件非常重要的事要拜托你.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I've come on a matter of grave importance.

267
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,140
是喔, 那你该找个同样重要的人来帮你.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You should find some gravely important people, then.

268
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:13,940
魔镜不见了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}The Mirror is gone.

269
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,530
本以为它的魔力会随着莱维娜的死而消失.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}We believed its dark magic died with Ravenna.

270
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,900
可我们都错了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}We were wrong.

271
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:22,780
魔镜里有一股邪恶的
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}There is an evil within the Mirror

272
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,990
力量正在日益壮大.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}that has only grown in power.

273
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:29,120
白雪她决定在这股力量失控之前
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And Queen Snow White has vowed to rid her kingdom of it

274
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,330
让它彻底远离我们的王国.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}before its darkness cannot be stopped.

275
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,630
两周前, 白雪她派了一队人马
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Two weeks ago, the queen ordered a detachment of soldiers

276
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,960
将魔镜送往圣地
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}to take the Mirror to Sanctuary.

277
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,260
可之后他们就再也没有回来.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}They never returned.

278
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,170
等等, 我不是你的手下.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Wait, wait. I'm not your man.

279
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,220
可你是我们王国中最出色的猎人.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You're the best tracker we have in the kingdom.

280
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,260
正如你说的, 魔镜是邪恶之物,
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And as you say, the Mirror is evil

281
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,350
绝不能让它落入恶人之手.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}and it mustn't fall into the hands of the wrong person.

282
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,810
那白雪以为就我能找的到魔镜吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And Snow White thinks I'm the one to find it?

283
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:52,480
是她授意你去找到魔镜的.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}She commands you to find it.

284
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,980
然后把它送去圣地
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And to deliver it to Sanctuary,

285
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,560
只有那样才能封存魔镜的邪恶力量.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}where its wickedness can forever be contained.

286
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,400
你会帮我们的吧 不是吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Do you acceptor not?

287
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,030
当然, 当然, 当然. 他当然会啊.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Yes, yes, yes. He accepts.

288
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,360
何况到时候还有赏金.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Provided there's a reward.

289
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,410
我才不稀罕什么赏金.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I don't want no reward.

290
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,740
艾力.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Eric.

291
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:13,910
白雪她的情况不太好.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Snow White is unwell.

292
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,210
是魔镜...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}The Mirror...

293
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,090
她说她会忍不住想看它.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}She said she couldn't stop looking at it.

294
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:23,130
她还会听到魔镜的声音在召换她.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}She could hear its voice calling for her.

295
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,590
所以她才要把魔镜送走.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}That's why she sent it away.

296
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,990
那是什么东西?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What was that thing?

297
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,040
把你的全部兵力都转移到北面.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Move all your forces to the northern border.

298
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,710
为何? 你知道些什么?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Why? What do you know?

299
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,250
芙蕾雅, 北国女王.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Freya, Queen of the North.

300
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,170
那只猫头鹰是她派来的眼线.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}That owl was her spy.

301
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,920
现在, 她已经知道魔镜的事了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Now she knows about the Mirror.

302
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:06,380
如果让她得到了魔镜, 我们所珍视的一切都会变成冰雪.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And if she finds it, everything we hold dear will be covered in ice.

303
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,470
派人守住北境.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Move your men to the north.

304
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,520
你们还在这干嘛?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What are you two still doing here?

305
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,190
我们是你的搭挡.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}We're your partners.

306
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,650
不, 我不需要搭挡.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}No, you're not.

307
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,820
我也是白雪公主的人.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I am Snow White's man as well.

308
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,610
我是说-我是说小矮人. 如果需要帮忙, 算上我们俩!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I mean, dwarf. If she's in trouble, I wanna help!

309
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,870
女王陛下. 我们拿下了瓦尔达.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}My queen, Vardhelm has fallen.

310
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,460
那是最后的要塞.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}It was the last stronghold.

311
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,380
整个白色大地都是您的了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}The entire White Lands are yours.

312
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,170
您胜利了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You've won.

313
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,210
我有吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Havel?

314
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,140
游戏还没结束.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}The game's not finished.

315
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,080
这世界的尽头在哪? 更广的南方呢?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Is this where the world ends, or is there more?

316
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,290
女王陛下, 我们无法攻占南方.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}My queen, the South cannot be conquered.

317
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,790
白雪公主的王国太大了, 而她的军队也...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Snow White's lands are too vast, her armies are too...

318
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:21,420
你早就知道艾力还活着?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Did you know that Eric was alive?

319
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,170
对不对?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Did you?

320
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:27,170
我...怎么会?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I...  How?

321
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,260
我向你发誓
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I swear to you.

322
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,880
- 我亲手把他躯体... - 别紧张.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}- I threw his body...  - That's alright.

323
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,720
这样反而更好.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I prefer it this way.

324
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:35,180
他在找一样东西.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}There's something that he seeks.

325
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:38,230
而我想得到它.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I want it.

326
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,600
我姊姊的魔镜.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}My sister's mirror.

327
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,900
它蕴含着巨大的魔力.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}It holds great power.

328
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,860
有了它 我就能成就一番事业.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And with it at my command, I can do great things.

329
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:49,490
我会解救 每一个孩子.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I will free every child.

330
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:51,490
拯救他们所有人,
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I will save them all.

331
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:52,910
就像当年的你一样
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}As I saved you.

332
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,990
而我的猎人军团会变得更强大
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And my army of Huntsmen will grow

333
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,370
到时候 没人可以挡我的道
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}until nothing will stand in its path.

334
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,960
所以说, 游戏还没结束.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}So, you see, the game is not finished.

335
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,090
让猎人军团待命.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Prepare the Huntsmen.

336
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,920
喔
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Oh.

337
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,130
哦.猎人.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Oh. Huntsman.

338
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,430
嗯？
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Hmm?

339
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,260
什么？有多少
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What? How much further?

340
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,220
有多少
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}How much further?

341
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,270
什么？你说什么 让我找 我根本不知道
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What? To the place I'm looking for that I don't know where it is?

342
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,390
这很难说
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}It's hard to say.

343
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,520
This one's had a strop on since we left.

344
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,790
他们是从这里走的.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}They came through here.

345
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,000
再明显不过了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Well, obviously.

346
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:49,840
这条是往北走的路.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}This takes us to the northern road.

347
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,800
直接通往圣地
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Leads direct to Sanctuary.

348
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,010
不是猎人也知道这些.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Don't need to be a Huntsman to know that.

349
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,090
嘿, 莱恩, 猜猜我是谁?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Hey, Nion, who am I?

350
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,300
哦
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Ooh.

351
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,970
我在和尘土说话呢. 我听到它们和我说话了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I'm talking to the dirt. I hear it speak to me.

352
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,890
他可是这方面的高手, 格里夫.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}He's actually quite good at this, Gryff.

353
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:05,760
得了吧他. 他就是个小丑.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Get stuffed. He's a buffoon.

354
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:06,850
我们往北走.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Well... We ride north.

355
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:10,020
其实, 他们往西走了
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Actually, they headed west.

356
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,690
往北走是一片平地 没有任何遮蔽物.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}The northern road cuts through a plain. Nowhere to take cover.

357
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:17,110
往西走 旁边就是片森林.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}The western road runs next to a forest.

358
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,520
他们会选择在那里扎营
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}That's where they would've made camp.

359
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,190
所以我们去那里找
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}That's where we're going to find them.

360
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,570
这很明显...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Obviously...

361
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:25,700
- 尘土又在和我说话了. - 它说了什么?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}- The dirt is talking to me again.  - What's it saying?

362
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:28,580
他在说那个多嘴的傻瓜.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}He's saying the mouthy one's an idiot

363
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,620
连自己的小命都保不住 不如早点卷舖盖回家.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}who wouldn't last a day on his own, and should go home.

364
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,710
我很赞同.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I agree.

365
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,880
在拿到赏金之前我是不会回去的.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I'm not going home till I get my reward.

366
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,130
你不但拿不到赏金 还可能会丧命.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You want gold, but all you're going to find out here is death.

367
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:43,220
说得跟真的一样.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}A bit dramatic.

368
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,590
对, 不过以防万一这是真的.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Dramatic, yeah, unless it's true,

369
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,970
我想我们最好考虑一下.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}and then we should consider it an accurate warning, I think.

370
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:51,140
我才不怕什么芙蕾雅的冰雪.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I know I'm not afraid of Freya of the Frost.

371
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,890
嘿, 小声点. 说话别那么大声.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Oy. Not so loud. Keep your voice down.

372
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:57,230
你们比我想像中的还要愚蠢.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You're even more stupid than I thought.

373
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,030
哇。
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Whoa.

374
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,650
真是见鬼.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Bloody hell.

375
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,030
谁会在光天化日下袭击他们?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Who would've attacked them out here in the open?

376
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,910
小心点. 他们可能还在附近.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Keep your eyes peeled. They could still be around.

377
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:54,290
找找看有没有他们的踪迹, 血迹, 或者其他的.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Look for tracks, blood trails Anything.

378
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,820
闪边去!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Go on! Get off!

379
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,500
都是他们自己的箭.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}These are their own arrows,

380
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,380
他们自己的刀.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}their own blades.

381
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:45,840
他们是互相残杀的.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}They killed each other.

382
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,550
可为什么呢?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}But why?

383
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,510
他们都是女王的手下.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}These are all the queen's men.

384
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,740
魔镜当时就在这里.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}The Mirror was here.

385
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:24,840
这绝不是他们自己的箭.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Well, this is definitely not one of theirs.

386
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,050
我从小在金矿里长大.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}l grew up in the mines.

387
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,970
我敢说这东西价值连城.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}That's worth half the world.

388
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:34,390
魔镜就在这东西的主人那里.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Whoever it belongs to has the Mirror.

389
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,730
我们得抢先在芙蕾雅之前找到.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}We need to find it before Freya does.

390
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:49,400
这是什么?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What's this?

391
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,280
我们得往小路走.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}We have to get off the road.

392
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,870
看他知道些什么
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}See if he knows something.

393
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,000
有点安静 你没事吧
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Bit quiet. You all right?

394
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,050
小心 你没事吧
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Fine. You all right?

395
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:15,760
嗯 我没事
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Yeah, I'm all right.

396
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:23,850
我想打听点... 消息.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I'm looking for information.

397
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,020
这么点钱打听不到什么.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You'll not get much for that.

398
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:33,070
我想问. 离这不远的地方发生过一场厮杀.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Well, there was a wee massacre on the road not far from here.

399
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,860
是女王的几个手下. 你知道这件事吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}The queen's soldiers. You know anything about that?

400
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,650
没错, 几天前他们路过这里.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Yeah, they passed through here  a few days ago.

401
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,780
- 是吗? - 可他们没有停下.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}- They did?  - They didn't stop. They weren't thirsty.

402
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,990
当时有人跟踪他们吗...?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Was anyone...  anyone following them or...?

403
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,580
哦, 给我也来一杯.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Oh, a pint as well.

404
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:06,560
看来是"不行"啦.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I take that as a "No""

405
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:07,980
再见.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Good day..

406
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,950
她以为她是谁啊.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}A bit choosy for what she's offering.

407
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:21,280
或许你该找你的同类试试
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Perhaps you'd have better luck with your own kind.

408
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:23,240
你见过女的小矮人吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Have you ever seen a female dwarf?

409
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:25,370
- 没, 我还真没见过. - 丑的惊世骇俗
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}No,I can% say I have. Horrifying.

410
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,410
惊世骇俗还算好的.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Horrifying's the best of them.

411
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,000
根本就是惨不忍睹.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Repulsive things.

412
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,420
丑如魔鬼的公牛
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Ugly as the devil's bullocks.

413
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,420
所有的关节和头发
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}All knuckles and hair.

414
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,630
臭脾气和发育不良
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Foul tempered and stunted.

415
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:39,510
不自然的，畸形的，金除根，满嘴脏话
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Unnatural, misshapen, gold grubbing, foul-mouthed

416
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,430
成堆的侧向驴屁股
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}piles of sideways donkey ass.

417
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,180
我可真是孤陋寡闻了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}So, assuming this is a commonly held opinion,

418
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,140
那么小矮人宝宝都是怎么生出来的?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}how exactly are new dwarves made?

419
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,310
呃, 一般来说都是意外.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Uh, generally by accident.

420
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:50,690
比如当时光线太暗.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Too little light.

421
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,480
- 或者酒喝太多. - 哈哈.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Too much of this. Yeah.

422
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:55,820
来吧, 干了它
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Come on. Keep up.

423
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,530
门一开还真冷.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Chilly with that door open.

424
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:02,820
把那什么递给我.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Pass me the...

425
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:04,580
- 什么? - 有一些是我自己的.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What? Yeah, some of the...

426
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:09,040
看来你们三个都是远道而来.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You three look like you're far from home.

427
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,040
对, 没错. 进来避个雨 一会还要赶路.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Aye. Just taking shelter, then moving on.

428
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,800
他的太太一定很迷人.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}The missus must be quite a looker.

429
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,010
真会说笑
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}That's a good one.

430
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:19,460
你刚才说什么?- 先搁一边.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What he say? That's all right.

431
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:22,380
不, 不, 不. 我可受不了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}No. No, I'm not having it. Aye.

432
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:24,340
你说话小心点, 可别闪掉舌头.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You ought to hold your tongue, mate, before you lose it.

433
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:26,050
不然是怎样?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}ls that so?

434
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,430
如果就我一个人, 我根本就不担心
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You know, if it was just me, I wouldn't be worried.

435
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,350
可加上他, 我就有那么一丁点担心了
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}If it was me and him, I'd be a tiny bit worried,

436
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,100
因为他实在太没用了. -
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}because he's a bit of a waster.

437
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:34,190
他胡说
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Not true.

438
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:36,940
但这些都不重要  因为有他在这里.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}But none of that matters, because we're with him.

439
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:41,240
眨眼的功夫, 他就能把你们的肠子掏出来
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And he will gut you like a deer quicker than you can blink.

440
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,030
在你们面前这位...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Because this man here,

441
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:45,200
就是传说中的猎神.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}this man is the Huntsman.

442
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:47,450
是真的吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Is this true?

443
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:49,540
你就是那个猎人?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Are you the Huntsman?

444
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,040
就是我. 好吧.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}That's me. Well...

445
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,790
真是不巧...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}The thing of it is...

446
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:02,590
我们都是猎人.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}We're all Huntsmen.

447
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:06,390
我很抱歉... - 没关系.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I'm sorry. It's all right.

448
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:29,740
等等, 等等...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Wait, wait, wait.

449
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:31,080
有话我们好好说嘛?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Can we not talk about this?

450
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:03,280
你说自己是一名猎人?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You call yourself a Huntsman?

451
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:08,120
我还以为敢背叛女王的猎人有多厉害呢.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I expected more from a man who had the courage to betray his queen.

452
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:10,780
值得吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And for what?

453
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:12,950
就为了那个懦弱的女人
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}For the love of some spineless woman?

454
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,250
或许当年你还有几分能耐, 兄弟.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Maybe you were something in your day, brother,

455
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,340
可今时不同往日了
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}but that day is long gone.

456
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:30,640
准备好安心上路了吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Have you made your peace?

457
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:33,310
我很快, 就能安心了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I'll have it soon enough.

458
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:36,230
告诉芙蕾雅 到死我都是自由的.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Tell Freya I died a free man.

459
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:38,060
芙蕾雅才不在乎你是怎么死的.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Freya doesn't care how you die.

460
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,070
没人在乎.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}No one cares.

461
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,780
根本没人记得你.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You're already forgotten.

462
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,320
快撤! 大家快走!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}LEIFR: Fall back! Fall back, now!

463
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,490
你老了不少.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You have aged.

464
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,490
莎拉. 莎拉?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Sara.

465
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:19,080
是我把你们绑起来的.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I tied you up.

466
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:21,370
她是他的妻子还是什么?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}She his wife or something?

467
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,290
不, 不可能. 他的妻子早就死了
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}No. Can't be. His wife's dead.

468
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:25,670
死了?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Dead?

469
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,010
你是这么和别人说的吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Is that what you told everyone?

470
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,470
假装自己是一个伤心的鳏夫.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You poor, heartbroken widower.

471
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:37,390
这个故事一定让不少无知少女为你流泪吧.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}That story must've wet the eyes of many a young lass.

472
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:40,270
甚至是以身相许.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Maybe more than their eyes.

473
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,730
不, 不, 不. 你已经死了
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}No, no... No, you're dead.

474
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:45,650
我亲眼看到的.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I saw you die.

475
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,980
这只是幻觉. 不可能是真的
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}This is not real. This is not happening.

476
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:53,110
你是鬼魂.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Or else I'm...

477
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:56,620
不然的话...难道...是我死了
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Or else I'm dead.

478
00:47:56,990 --> 00:47:58,410
我是不是已经死了?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Am I not alive?

479
00:47:58,580 --> 00:47:59,870
你还没死.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You're alive.

480
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,410
你本来是该死了
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Although, you should be dead.

481
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,290
你的头部被重击了六下...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You got hit on the head like, six...

482
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:04,790
你觉得是, 六还是七? - 七下
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What do you think, six or seven? Seven.

483
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,130
对 七下 很严重.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Seven times. A lot.

484
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,050
所以, 这一切... - 千真...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}So this is... Real.

485
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,470
万确
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Very.

486
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:18,970
你以为我会忘了吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Did you think I'd forget?

487
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:23,810
你以为我会原谅这一切吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Did you think I'd forgive?

488
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:28,020
无论"生死", 你说过的
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Stand or fall, you said.

489
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:31,490
你都不会离开我身边, 你说过的.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You'd never leave my side, you said.

490
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:34,320
你都发过誓的
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You swore it.

491
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:39,490
而你却逃跑了
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And then you fled.

492
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:42,000
我看着你战斗 我也看到你逃跑了
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I see you fight, and I see you run.

493
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:11,610
不, 不, 不, 莎拉. 事情不是这样的
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}No, Sara. That's not what happened.

494
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:14,190
我当时看到的是塔尔杀了你
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I saw Tull kill you.

495
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,610
我亲眼看到他杀了你. 否则我不会丢下你
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I saw him kill you, with my own eyes. I would never leave you.

496
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:19,450
可我也是亲眼看见你离开
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}But I saw you leave me, with my own eyes.

497
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:22,740
而且所有人都知道
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And you, of all people, should know

498
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:25,160
塔尔根本杀不了我
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Tull could never kill me.

499
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:26,620
莎拉. 我...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Sara.

500
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:28,330
别说了. - 我向你发誓
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Don't. I swear to you.

501
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,040
她把我关在地牢里
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}She put me in her dungeon.

502
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:32,380
整整七年了
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}For seven years.

503
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:35,970
当我最后逃出来的时候, 我发誓一定要找到你
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And when I finally escaped, I swore I'd find you.

504
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:38,050
我花了不少时间
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}It's taken me a long time.

505
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,680
总算让我找到你了
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}But here we are.

506
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,930
所谓丈夫...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Husband

507
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,640
和妻子
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}and wife.

508
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:52,820
你真的相信这一切  相信我抛弃了你?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You honestly believe this? That I'd abandon you?

509
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:55,150
是的
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Aye.

510
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:03,240
你还是忘了稳住阵脚.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You still forget your balance.

511
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:09,420
她还有一把刀
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}She's got another knife.

512
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,130
对, 没错. 我们应该早点说的
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Yeah. Yeah, I probably should have said something.

513
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:13,340
Mmm-hmm.

514
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:18,090
她左边的靴子里还藏了两把匕首
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}She's got two more little ones in her left boot.

515
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:21,260
现在说也没用了
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}It's no longer important.

516
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:26,270
如果在我死前 还能多看你几眼
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}If your face is the last thing that I'm meant to see,

517
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:28,140
我死而无憾.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}then I'm grateful.

518
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:33,400
既然这样 我就成全你
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}It should be the last thing you see.

519
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:35,730
哦
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Oh!

520
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:40,240
我不喜欢她
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I don't like her.

521
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:42,740
我一点也不喜欢她
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I don't like her one little bit.

522
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:15,980
女王陛下
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}My queen.

523
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:18,360
别点火
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}No fire.

524
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:21,950
不准点火
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}No fire!

525
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,010
下去吧
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}It's all right.

526
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:11,160
那么.如果让芙蕾雅拿到了魔镜会怎么样?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}So, what happens if Freya gets this mirror?

527
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,830
你不觉得我们之间
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Don't you think that you and me

528
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,590
还有更重要的事可谈吗  比如我们
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}have other things to discuss, like us?

529
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:18,750
不
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}No.

530
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:21,050
到底会怎么样?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What happens?

531
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,550
她会变得势不可挡
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}She'd be unstoppable.

532
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,810
我的马在哪里?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Where's my horse?

533
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:35,270
我把它放了
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I sent it off.

534
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,390
你放我的马做什么?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What did you do that for?

535
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,350
没有马就不会留下踪迹
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}No horses, no tracks.

536
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,600
我们不走大路, 避人耳目
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}We keep off the road, out of sight.

537
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:44,440
这么说, 你决定跟我走了?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}So you're coming with me, then?

538
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,940
不, 是你跟着我走
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}No, you're coming with me.

539
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,030
好吧 你爱怎么说就怎么说吧
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Yeah, whatever you need to tell yourself, that's fine.

540
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:53,490
在我看来, 要是没有我 你们会死得很惨
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}From what I can see, your wee band won't do too well without me.

541
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:55,030
什么? 不..
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Huh? No...

542
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:59,000
不管魔镜蕴含了什么力量 我都不会让芙蕾雅得手的
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}SARA: Whatever power this mirror contains, I'll not let Freya wield it.

543
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,750
我们先找到魔镜 然后把它送去圣地
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}We'll find it, and we'll bring it to the Sanctuary.

544
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:04,040
等到一切结束后..
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And then you and I

545
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:06,000
我们从此分道扬镳
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}will part forever.

546
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:08,170
现在.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Now.

547
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,380
告诉我这是什么
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Tell me about this.

548
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,350
您是怎么想的？关于什么？
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What do you think? About what?

549
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:18,930
你信任那个女人吗？
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}The woman. Do you trust her?

550
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:22,520
嗯 ， 我认为我们没有多少选择的余地
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Well, I mean, I don't think we've got much of a choice.

551
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:25,360
除此之外,她就是个垃圾
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Besides, she's pretty good in a scrap.

552
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,070
我想在很久以前就派上用场了
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I imagine that would come in handy before too long.

553
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:30,360
天黑前就能到卡伦渡口了
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}We'll hit Callao Crossing by nightfall.

554
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:32,320
那里有黑市, 他们可能把魔镜给卖了
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}There's a market there. They might have sold the Mirror.

555
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:35,330
跟踪从来不是你的强项 对吗
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Tracking never was one of your strengths, was it?

556
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:37,990
我不知道你在等待什么
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I cannae wait to find out what yours is.

557
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,750
如果他们的箭都镶崁着钻石
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}If an enemy uses diamonds for arrows,

558
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:42,000
我不认为他们会把魔镜卖了换钱
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I doubt they need to sell the Mirror for money.

559
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,000
那好,如果你不喜欢我的计划, 你可以别跟着我
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Well, if you don't like my plan, you can piss off.

560
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,090
喔. 真是个万人迷
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}That is charming!

561
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:48,840
既然这样, 你也可以别跟着我
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And you can piss off, too, as you so eloquently put it,

562
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,590
不过你别想摆脱我
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}but that's not gonna get rid of me.

563
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,880
你仍然是我妻子
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You're still my wife.

564
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:58,810
我们...我们当时被骗了
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Look, we were deceived.

565
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:01,100
那块冰是芙蕾雅的假象
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}The ice wall that Freya put between us,

566
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:03,270
她让我们看到她所制造的幻象
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}she showed us what she wanted us to see.

567
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:07,320
等等
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Wait.

568
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,440
万一我是对的呢?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And what if I'm right?

569
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:12,360
难道不该给彼此一个机会吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Do we not deserve that chance?

570
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,110
这些都不重要了
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}It wouldn't matter.

571
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,280
你早晚还是会离开
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You'd leave again.

572
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:19,660
我们的软弱让我们看不清真相
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}We blind ourselves to the truth because we're weak,

573
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:21,450
你说给彼此机会
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}because we hope.

574
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,330
我们之间已经没有机会了
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}But there's no hope for love.

575
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:26,290
爱情止于背叛
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Love ends in betrayal.

576
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:28,960
这是不变的事实
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Aye and always.

577
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:34,010
好吧, 我是不会放弃的
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Well, I don't believe you.

578
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:44,350
别动. 别动
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Don't move. Don't move.

579
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:58,030
喔
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Ooh.

580
00:54:58,230 --> 00:54:59,610
看来是老把戏了
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}That looks familiar.

581
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:02,320
小矮人就爱设陷阱. 我也经常那么做
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Dwarf-made trap. It's where I would've put it.

582
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,160
没错. 要抓住我们可得换张大一点的网  才赶得上我们
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Yes, it'll take more than that to catch the likes of...

583
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,290
喔, 不要啊
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}No! No!

584
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:15,580
好得不灵 坏的灵
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Silly mope.

585
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:22,550
干嘛?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What?

586
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:24,260
我也没料到会这样
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}This was unexpected.

587
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:27,050
喔. 什么? 这么明显的陷阱还意想不到?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Oh, what? The hidden dwarf trap was unexpected?

588
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:30,770
你不是很利害的猎人. 你说呢
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You're not the tracker you think you are.

589
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:32,730
因为有人让我分心了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I've been a little distracted.

590
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:41,440
嘿, 多琳娜, 猎物上鈎了...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Hey, Doreena, we've got something.

591
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:43,740
大丰收. 大丰收.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Catch of the day, catch of the day.

592
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,200
上帝啊, 别这样
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}God, no.

593
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,790
小心点, 小帅哥
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Careful, sweetheart.

594
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:51,790
我可不想毁了你那英俊的小脸蛋
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I wouldn't want to ruin that pretty little face of yours.

595
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,620
好吧.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Okay.

596
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,090
喔, 饶了我
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Oh, bugger me.

597
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:00,880
喔, 我们无冤无仇, 对吧?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Oh, it's like that, is it?

598
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,550
你甚至不认识我们
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You don't even know us.

599
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,130
我为什么要认识你这个大饼脸的小矮人?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What do I need to know, you squat-faced little he-dwarves?

600
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,390
多看你一眼我都想吐.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Sight of you clots make me sick.

601
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:09,310
闭上你的臭嘴, 你个愚蠢的泼妇
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Shut your mouth, you manky slag.

602
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:10,890
你才要给我闭嘴, 你个猥琐的家伙
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Shut yours, you grotty wanker.

603
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:13,140
我去你的, 你这个丑八怪
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Kiss my arse, you filthy minger.

604
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:15,230
我才去你的, 你这个天杀的浑球
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Kiss mine, you wobbly shite box.

605
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:17,860
抱歉
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Sorry.

606
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:20,320
小矮人女士 我们并不想冒犯你
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Madam dwarf, we have no quarrel with you.

607
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,690
我们在找一面镜子
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}We seek a mirror.

608
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:23,150
可我这没有镜子
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I don't got no mirror.

609
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,650
哈, 哈, 很明显啊
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Oh, that's clear.

610
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:26,570
好啊. 喔, 你们欠揍...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Right. Oh, you are getting it.

611
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:28,030
不, 不, 不! 够了, 够了, 够了
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}No. No, enough,enough.

612
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,620
说说看你想要什么
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Just tell us what you want.

613
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:33,830
嗯, 个人而言 我要你一丝不挂的 环绕在我身边
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Personally, I'd like you to take your shirt off and prance around for me.

614
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,330
不过看你还算稳重的份上
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}But seeing as you're so modest,

615
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,000
我就劫个小财好了
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I'll settle for every penny you've got.

616
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:39,920
啊, 原来你要的是钱啊
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Aye, so it's money you're after.

617
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,710
我-我还真抱歉
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}MY apologies.

618
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,760
我身边只有这个
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}All I have is this.

619
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:47,380
你知道这是什么吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You know what this is?

620
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:49,600
这么大一颗钻石
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}It's a great big bloody diamond.

621
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,220
我又没瞎
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I'm not blind.

622
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:53,350
你从哪弄来的?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Where'd you get that?

623
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,100
你放我们下来 我就告诉你
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You let us down, and I'll tell you.

624
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,310
多琳娜!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Doreena!

625
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,020
马上来, 布朗温太太!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Coming, Mrs. Bromwyn!

626
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,070
替我看着这些家伙
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Keep an eye on this lot.

627
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:08,200
如果他们俩再多嘴 你就放箭射他们
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Shoot the he-dwarves if they get mouthy.

628
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,370
或你喜欢 随便射也行
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Or if you just feel like it.

629
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:14,870
别摔着我们
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You don't just cut it.

630
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:26,050
你口渴吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You thirsty?

631
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:27,630
我这有水 你要不要
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I could get you some water, if you'd like.

632
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,220
哦. 好的, 谢谢你, 我都快渴死了
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Oh, yeah. Thank you. I'd like that a lot.

633
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,390
啊. 我是说, 不  我才不稀罕你们的水
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Ah! I mean, nah, I don't want nothing from the likes of you.

634
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:35,060
好了, 你们这些手下败将
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}All right, my little fishes.

635
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:37,850
要不要听听我的建议
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I've got a little proposition for you.

636
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:41,520
合作? - 合作?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Truce? Truce?

637
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:44,400
除非先让我掐死你...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}When I get my hands around your lice-bitten neck...

638
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:46,440
呀... 好了. 我们合作.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Yeah, yeah. He's just... Truce.

639
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,400
这颗钻石
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Your diamond...

640
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:50,240
你是从一支金色的矛上取下来的, 对吧?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You got it from a golden spear, right?

641
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:52,070
是的, 没错
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Aye, I did.

642
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:55,700
是地精
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Goblins.

643
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:57,620
地精?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Goblins?

644
00:57:58,580 --> 00:57:59,870
地精?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Goblins?

645
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:03,000
那不是一个愚蠢的传说吗
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}That old fishwives' tale.

646
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:04,420
你让我们相信这些?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You expect us to believe that?

647
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:06,090
我就看到了你这个又丑又蠢的家伙,
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}l expect you to stand there

648
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:08,670
所以安静的站在那别说话.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}and look ugly and stupid, and say nothing else.

649
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:13,640
真的有地精.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Goblins is real.

650
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:15,430
世上最厉害的小偷.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Finest thieves in the world.

651
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,770
同时他们也贪婪成性.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And greedy as the day is long.

652
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:19,560
我们本来想抓一个的 - 没错.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}We was trying to catch one. Yeah.

653
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:22,100
据说, 他们连盔甲都是金子做的
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You know, they say their armor is made of gold.

654
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:23,770
在哪里能找到他们?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Where can we find them?

655
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:24,900
就在附近.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Not far.

656
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:27,150
在多利安河的上游有一片隐密的森林.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}There's a hidden forest just up the Dorian River

657
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:29,530
就在圣地的西北面.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}on the northwest side of the Sanctuary.

658
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:32,160
传说他们把所有的宝物都藏在那里.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}They say they keep all their treasure there in that wood.

659
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:35,080
黄金, 白银, 珠宝, 一望无际.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Gold, silver, jewels, as far as the eye can see.

660
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,080
只要你的镜子够闪, 就一定会在那里.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}If your mirror is shiny, it'll be in there somewhere.

661
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:40,620
我们可以从那里直通圣地?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Can we access the Sanctuary from there?

662
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:44,130
我不知道. 或许吧.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Dunno. Maybe.

663
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:45,960
那你们能带路吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}ERIC: Will you show us the way?

664
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:49,300
好了, 你看, 所以我说我有个提议.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Ah. Well, you see, that's where the proposition comes in.

665
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,140
你要知道, 没人能活着走出那片森林.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You see, no one's ever come out of them woods alive.

666
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:56,640
你俩大个, 不过你们俩看起来倒像是猎人.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}But you two big ones, you look like Huntsmen.

667
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,470
你们应该很有一套吧, 是吧?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And Huntsmen are pretty handy with a blade, yeah?

668
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:01,850
我们会和你们一起去
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}We all go in together.

669
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:03,650
你俩大个
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You get your mirror.

670
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:05,020
你们应该很有一套吧, 是吧?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And me and Doreena fill our pockets

671
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:06,650
而我和多琳娜就负责填满我们的腰包.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}with as much loot as we can carry.

672
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,360
成交?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Deal?

673
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,240
好, 成交.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Aye, deal.

674
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:20,250
走之前 让我先杀了这两个家伙. 什么? 不是吧.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Right after I kill those two. What? No.

675
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:21,370
怎么? 等等.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What? Hang on.

676
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,000
怎么?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Why?

677
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:27,590
我也不知道. 也许是有点喜欢他们吧.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I don't know. I like them, I guess.

678
00:59:28,210 --> 00:59:29,210
为什么?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Oh.

679
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:31,670
喜欢小矮人, 你吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Like a dwarf, do you?

680
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,360
既然, 你是布朗温太太.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}So, Mrs. Bromwyn.

681
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:54,450
那么布朗温先生在哪里?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Where's Mr. Bromwyn?

682
00:59:55,110 --> 00:59:56,700
谢天谢地, 他死了.?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Dead, thank God.

683
00:59:57,370 --> 00:59:58,830
他是怎么死的?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}HOW did he die?

684
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:01,080
自挖双眼死的吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Gouging his own eyes out?

685
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:04,420
你再多嘴我就送你去问他.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Keep flapping your gob and you'll find out.

686
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:09,960
之前的事我很抱歉.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I'm sorry about before.

687
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:12,010
其实我当时很想喝水.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I would've drunk your water.

688
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:14,680
你刚才看上去有点口渴.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You seemed thirsty.

689
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:17,470
没错, 的确很口渴.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Yeah, I was.

690
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:21,810
我发现天热的时候. 我就容易口渴 还有跑步时也会.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I get thirsty sometimes if it's hot, or if I'm running.

691
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:24,310
- 我也是! - 嘿.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Me, too!

692
01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:28,020
或者当我吃一些很咸的东西时.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Or sometimes if I eat something really salty, like, um...

693
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:30,190
- 就好比烤鸡. - 烤鸡.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Roast chicken. Chicken.

694
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:43,830
我知道你为什么不说话.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I know why you're not talking.

695
01:00:43,910 --> 01:00:45,120
你说呢?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Do you?

696
01:00:45,790 --> 01:00:49,210
因为你看到我和布朗温太太擦出火花了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Aye. You noticed the sparks between me and Mrs. Bromwyn.

697
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:51,380
我也没办法, 她就是我的菜.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I don't know what to say. She's my type.

698
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:53,010
大嗓门 爆脾气.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Loud and angry?

699
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:55,590
嗯, 我过去就喜欢这样的, 不是吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Well, it's what I'm used it, isn't it?

700
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:58,470
那你们一定会过上幸福美满的生活.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I'm awfully sure you'll have a good life together.

701
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,550
没错, 我们会.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Aye, we would.

702
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,100
不过有个问题.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}But there's a problem.

703
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:03,770
还有其他的女人.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Another woman.

704
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:06,020
个子高一点, 不过没那么漂亮.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Bit taller. Not as pretty, mind you.

705
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:09,350
听上去她不会蠢到在你身上浪费时间.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}She sounds far too clever to waste her time with you.

706
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:11,860
可我怎么记得...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Well, I remember

707
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:14,530
刚才我还和她相拥在一张网上呢.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}that one time we were caught up in a net together.

708
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:16,860
难道这是很久以前的事了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}This was a long, long time ago.

709
01:01:16,950 --> 01:01:19,700
在你的故事里 你永远都是个英雄?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Are you not the hero of every story you tell?

710
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:21,660
没错, 那是因为我很勇敢.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}That's because I'm very brave.

711
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:24,290
就像现在也是我保护你不被淹死.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Which is why I'm going to save you from drowning.

712
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:25,370
不然你想怎样...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And how do you expect...

713
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,630
这条船真是一不小心就会进水呢.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Some unpredictable waters around here.

714
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:32,340
不是我喔.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}It's not me.

715
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:36,470
你真是活生生的傻大个.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You're a right galoot.

716
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:39,890
那你就是傻妞罗.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}So are you.

717
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:50,190
我们到了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}We're here.

718
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:22,300
哦.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Oh...

719
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:24,680
哦, 亲爱的. 哦, 亲爱的. 来吧.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Come on.

720
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:53,540
你发现了什么?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What've you found?

721
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:55,880
打火石和铁块.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Flint and steel.

722
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:09,850
他们的血闻上去就像焦油.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Their blood smells like tar.

723
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:20,690
看到了吧. 都是金子做的.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You see? It is gold.

724
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:22,030
没错, 的确.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Yeah, it is.

725
01:03:32,290 --> 01:03:34,120
是谁说没地精的 啊?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Goblins ain't real, eh?

726
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:44,380
快看.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Look.

727
01:03:58,570 --> 01:03:59,900
小心别掉下去了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Do your best to stay dry.

728
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:01,740
这真是太疯狂了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}This is bonkers.

729
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:05,450
你应该感谢至少这里还有一座吊桥.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Praise the bridge that carries you over.

730
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:38,900
RAVE N NA; Kill.

731
01:04:39,730 --> 01:04:41,230
死尸.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Death.

732
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:42,730
又是自相残杀.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}They killed each other.

733
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:44,570
就像女王的军队一样.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Just like the queen's army.

734
01:04:54,450 --> 01:04:55,580
死尸.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Death.

735
01:04:56,710 --> 01:04:58,170
现在怎么办?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What now?

736
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:00,130
去拿我们要的东西.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Now we take what we came for.

737
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:03,380
把它包起来. 千万别往里面看.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Keep it covered. Do not look into it.

738
01:06:08,610 --> 01:06:09,820
快走开.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Bollocks.

739
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:19,540
去拿魔镜. 快!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}The Mirror. Move!

740
01:06:57,910 --> 01:06:59,450
- 这玩意真重. - 我什么都看不到.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}This is heavy. I can't see anything.

741
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:01,080
哦, 你推到我了!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You're pushing me.

742
01:07:27,770 --> 01:07:29,110
快走. 我看不见路.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Come on. I can't see.

743
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:31,860
别在乎你看见什么? 我看的见, 我在前面带路.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Cool it. You don't need to see. I can see. I'm at the front.

744
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:34,820
啊, 你踩到我了. 往右走.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Ah! Watch your feet. Move to the side.

745
01:07:34,910 --> 01:07:35,910
抬好.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Lift.

746
01:07:36,830 --> 01:07:37,910
哦, 我感觉到这桥在晃.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}This bridge is wobbling!

747
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:39,790
我也知道桥在晃, 你能闭嘴吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}it is obviously wobbling. Will you just shut up!

748
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:52,010
刚才看见没?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}See that? Whoo.

749
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:10,070
我一直都带在身边.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I've never taken it off.

750
01:08:22,950 --> 01:08:24,540
快跑吧, 亲爱的.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}It's time to go, love.

751
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:52,730
跑, 跑, 跑!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Go, go, go!

752
01:08:58,820 --> 01:08:59,950
把魔镜送到圣地去.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Take the Mirror to the Sanctuary.

753
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:11,590
快点.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Come on.

754
01:09:13,130 --> 01:09:14,130
不
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}No.

755
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:44,330
快帮我点火!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}l need fire. Come on.

756
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,170
千万别失手了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Don't you miss.

757
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,340
我从不失手.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I never miss.

758
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:37,090
他救了我们.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}He saved us.

759
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,400
艾力.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Eric!

760
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,240
你哭了吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Are you crying?

761
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:30,730
真想快点把那面魔镜给送走.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Can't rid ourselves soon enough of that thing.

762
01:11:31,390 --> 01:11:33,650
再走两小时就能到圣地的中心了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Look, the heart of Sanctuary's only two hours away.

763
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:35,190
要我说 我们得连夜出发.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I say we move tonight.

764
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:39,280
对, 看起来今晚夜色不错. 不会太暗.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Aye, there'll be a strong moon. Plenty of light.

765
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:40,360
不.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}No.

766
01:11:42,110 --> 01:11:44,320
谁知道黑暗中会埋伏着什么.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Who knows what's lurking in the dark?

767
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:45,660
这我同意.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I agree.

768
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:48,410
省省吧. 还有谁会是我们的对手.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Get stuffed. There's nothing out there could take us.

769
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:51,750
嗯哼, 你说得很对. 在酒馆我就抓到过你们.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}That's right. I took you. In the tavern.

770
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:53,410
我也抓到过你们.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I took you as well.

771
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,210
那就天亮再走吧.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}In the morning, then.

772
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:00,460
晚安.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Good night.

773
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:05,430
等送完魔镜之后.  我们就会去小矮人矿场.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And after the Sanctuary, on to the dwarven mining town.

774
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:09,100
他们一定都会抢着买我的宝贝.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Jewel and gold merchants, all looking to buy.

775
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:11,770
到时候我和多琳娜就要发大财了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Me and Doreena's gonna make an absolute killing.

776
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:13,940
她在哪里?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Where is she?

777
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:17,900
- 多琳娜去哪了? - 还有莱恩?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Where is Doreena? And Nion?

778
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:20,900
哇啊.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Well...

779
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:23,610
你快看看那边.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Would you look at that?

780
01:12:29,830 --> 01:12:30,950
泼妇.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Harpy-

781
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:35,170
这种呢, 就叫做飞燕草.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}This one is called delphinium.

782
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:37,630
治疗痔疮和牙疼都很有效.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}It's good for piles and toothache.

783
01:12:40,670 --> 01:12:43,380
这种又叫什么?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What's this one called? Uh...

784
01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:45,550
这只是普通的花而已.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}That's just a flower.

785
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:49,260
我觉得它很好看.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I think it's beautiful.

786
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:51,560
我觉得你也很好看.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I think you're beautiful.

787
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:53,100
- 我吗? - 对.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Me? Yeah.

788
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:54,180
不.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}No.

789
01:13:17,710 --> 01:13:20,130
如果你要我谢谢你, 我已经说过了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}If you're looking for gratitude, you have it.

790
01:13:21,290 --> 01:13:22,800
仅此而已.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Nothing more.

791
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:29,220
我到底该怎么做?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What exactly am I supposed to do?

792
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:32,180
你以为这事你说了算吗.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You think it's about you.

793
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:33,260
不
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}No.

794
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:34,810
你该怎么选择.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What you should choose.

795
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:36,480
你该做什么决定.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What you should do.

796
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:39,150
而我就在这里等人来救我 而你救了我.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}That I'm just waiting here for the man to pass a test.

797
01:13:39,230 --> 01:13:40,360
所以
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And you did.

798
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:42,520
我就得爱你是吗.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}So now I have to love you.

799
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,190
可我做不到.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}But I don't.

800
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:49,160
做选择的应该是我.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I choose for me.

801
01:13:49,910 --> 01:13:51,370
而不是你.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Not you.

802
01:13:54,370 --> 01:13:56,000
所以 别再缠着我了
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}So let me go.

803
01:13:57,750 --> 01:13:59,870
我说过. 无论生死, 我都不会离开你.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I can't. Stand or fall, I'll never leave you.

804
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:02,790
别再缠着我了! 别再缠着我了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Let me go! Let me go.

805
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,590
莎拉, 别这样.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Sara, stop it.

806
01:14:04,670 --> 01:14:06,670
你爱的那个人已经死了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}The one you loved is dead.

807
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:10,720
我甚至不记得当年的自己是什么模样.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I don't even remember what it feels like to be her.

808
01:14:10,930 --> 01:14:13,140
我们没有要求
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}We did not ask for our sins.

809
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:14,720
那不是我们想要的人生.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}We did not ask for this life.

810
01:14:14,810 --> 01:14:16,390
艾力, 我做了...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Eric, I've done

811
01:14:16,890 --> 01:14:18,390
许多可怕的事情.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}terrible things.

812
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:23,820
不可饶恕的事情.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Unforgivable things.

813
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:24,980
我知道.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I know.

814
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:27,320
我也是.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}So have I.

815
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:31,610
或许我们两个都不值得原谅.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Maybe you and me are not worthy of forgiveness.

816
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:34,280
可那些都是过去的事了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}That's for someone else to judge.

817
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:37,950
至少我们现在应该在一起.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}But we are worthy of each other.

818
01:15:43,310 --> 01:15:46,150
艾力.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Eric...

819
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,230
艾力.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Eric...

820
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:55,030
杀...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Kill...

821
01:15:55,110 --> 01:15:56,820
过来...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Come

822
01:15:57,740 --> 01:15:59,790
靠过来...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}closer...

823
01:16:01,410 --> 01:16:03,790
靠过来...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Closer.

824
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:08,170
靠过来...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Closer.

825
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:12,720
杀...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Kill...

826
01:16:21,270 --> 01:16:23,060
杀...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Kill...

827
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:24,850
杀...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Kill...

828
01:16:26,270 --> 01:16:28,020
没错
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Yes.

829
01:16:34,110 --> 01:16:36,740
给我杀.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Kill for me...

830
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:38,240
你怎么了?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What are you doing?

831
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:44,540
你是真心的吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Have you been true?

832
01:16:47,130 --> 01:16:48,130
艾力.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Eric.

833
01:16:48,210 --> 01:16:50,880
我的心在你那, 由始至终.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}My heart is yours, it always has been.

834
01:16:52,590 --> 01:16:53,800
可如果你不是认真的...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}But if this is a game...

835
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:58,180
了结了它.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}End it now.

836
01:16:59,430 --> 01:17:02,100
你对我是真心的吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Have you been true?

837
01:18:00,070 --> 01:18:01,870
猎人, 这是什么情况?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Huntsman, what is this?

838
01:18:02,950 --> 01:18:04,330
勇敢点, 兄弟.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Stand tall, brother.

839
01:18:39,950 --> 01:18:40,990
艾力.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Eric.

840
01:18:42,410 --> 01:18:43,870
我的艾力.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}My Eric.

841
01:18:44,990 --> 01:18:47,120
你的女王非常想你.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Your queen has missed you.

842
01:18:48,370 --> 01:18:50,330
你已经不是我的女王了, 芙蕾雅.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You're not my queen, Freya.

843
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:53,750
我永远都是你的女王.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}But I'm forever your queen.

844
01:18:53,830 --> 01:18:55,960
你说是吗, 莎拉?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Isn't that right, Sara?

845
01:18:57,380 --> 01:19:00,840
要知道... 是你抛弃了她, 艾力.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You see, you abandoned her, Eric.

846
01:19:02,010 --> 01:19:03,390
而, 不是我.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}But not I.

847
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:07,680
是我让她从绝望中站起来.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I raised her from despair.

848
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:11,940
也是我让她变得 像现在这样无坚不摧.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Made her the point of my spear, my tempered steel.

849
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:15,480
她带领我的军队
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}She's laid waste to kingdoms

850
01:19:15,570 --> 01:19:18,860
攻破了无数的王国. 让像你一样的男人俯首称臣
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}and brought men such as you to their knees.

851
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:22,610
她和你已经不一样了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}She's everything that you're not.

852
01:19:22,990 --> 01:19:24,700
我只要让她回到你身边
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}All I had to do was send her to you,

853
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:27,240
你自然会带我们找到魔镜.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}and you led her straight to the Mirror.

854
01:19:27,330 --> 01:19:29,000
太可悲了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}It's pathetic.

855
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:32,290
哦, 这些又是什么?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Oh, what are these?

856
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:34,330
小矮人.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Dwarves.

857
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:37,920
他们看上去就像个孩子.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}They're just like children.

858
01:19:38,090 --> 01:19:40,010
我们可不像孩子那么好惹, 老巫婆.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}We're mighty far from children, Bitch Queen.

859
01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:45,890
很可爱.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Adorable.

860
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:48,720
把魔镜带回去.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Bring me the Mirror.

861
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:50,140
有本事先杀了我再说!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You'll have to kill me first!

862
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:54,190
不.我不杀你.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}No, I won't.

863
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:58,610
不.多琳娜, 不要!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}NION: Doreena, no!

864
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:03,860
你早就知道了. 对不对?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You knew, didn't you?

865
01:20:04,910 --> 01:20:07,740
你知道她会背叛你 可你还是让她留下来.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You knew she'd betray you and you spared her still.

866
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:19,000
这次你吸取教训了吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Have you learnt my lesson at last?

867
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:22,340
继续伪装你的内心, 冰雪女王.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Harden your heart, Queen of Winter.

868
01:20:22,420 --> 01:20:24,180
你甚至可以冰封整个世界.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Bury the world in a tomb of ice.

869
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:25,430
可没有用的.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}It matters not.

870
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:27,760
爱还是会延续.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Love will endure.

871
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,640
或许你说的对.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Yes, perhaps you're right.

872
01:20:33,850 --> 01:20:35,270
那就让我们来看看吧?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Shall we find out?

873
01:20:43,150 --> 01:20:44,650
杀了他.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Kill him.

874
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:44,840
他死了吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Is he dead?

875
01:21:45,260 --> 01:21:46,590
我想是的.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I think so.

876
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:48,720
那怎么办?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What do we do?

877
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:51,180
把箭拔出来.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Pull it out.

878
01:21:52,430 --> 01:21:53,680
快啊!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Go on.

879
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:57,600
一. 二.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}One, two...

880
01:21:57,690 --> 01:21:58,690
利落点!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Quickly!

881
01:22:03,690 --> 01:22:05,610
见鬼, 真是太疼了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Bloody hell, that hurt.

882
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:08,360
没想到她居然射偏了!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I don't believe it! She missed!

883
01:22:15,540 --> 01:22:17,330
她从不失手.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}She never misses.

884
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:19,670
你是不是傻了?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Have you lost your mind?

885
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:22,420
她背叛了我们!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}She betrayed us.

886
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:24,880
艾力, 她不是丘比特.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Eric, she is not Cupid.

887
01:22:25,050 --> 01:22:28,920
我可不认为 你胸口的那一箭是她爱的表示.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I doubt that an arrow to the chest is an expression of her love.

888
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:30,010
喔, 不, 不.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}No,no,no.

889
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:33,220
好戏才刚刚开始, 我的朋友们,
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}There is a grand design at work here, friends.

890
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:35,390
我已经感觉到了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And it grows even louder.

891
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:39,060
头部受创. 第八次.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Head injury. Number eight.

892
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:42,610
她从不失手.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}She never misses.

893
01:22:50,950 --> 01:22:52,820
听着, 我比你们俩加起来都生气.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Look, lam twice as angry as you are.

894
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:56,240
多琳娜是我在世上唯一的朋友.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Doreena was the only friend I had in this world,

895
01:22:56,330 --> 01:22:57,870
你得接受这个事实.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}but you need to face facts.

896
01:22:57,950 --> 01:22:59,830
莎拉她并没有站在你这边.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Sara is not on your side.

897
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:03,210
我不需要你相信我所相信的.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I don't need you to believe what I believe.

898
01:23:03,790 --> 01:23:05,090
它们又是干嘛的?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What are these for, exactly?

899
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:10,590
让我给你点提示.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I'll give you a hint.

900
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:12,890
不是我们骑它就是它骑我们.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}We're not gonna carry them on our backs.

901
01:23:13,470 --> 01:23:16,890
你打算怎么做? 一路跟去北方?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}So, what are you gonna do? Trek all the way to the frozen North?

902
01:23:16,970 --> 01:23:19,390
赤手空拳对抗女巫和她的军队吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Face down an evil sorceress and her entire army?

903
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:21,190
差不多.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Aye.

904
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:24,940
好吧, 算上我!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}All right, I'm in!

905
01:23:56,300 --> 01:24:00,100
塔尔, 把小矮人放进画室 并把魔镜带到我的密室去.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Tull, put the dwarves in the gallery and bring the Mirror to my sanctum.

906
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,150
欢迎回来, 莎拉.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Welcome home, Sara.

907
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,760
芙蕾雅...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Freya.

908
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:39,720
到我这来...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Come to me.

909
01:24:45,770 --> 01:24:48,770
念出来...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Say the words.

910
01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:55,650
把它们念出来...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Speak the words.

911
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:58,160
"岁月是无情残酷的
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}"The age can be wicked

912
01:24:58,820 --> 01:25:01,330
对于那些孤军奋战的人.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}"to those who walk alone.

913
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,790
当我站在魔镜面前,
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}"When I look into the Mirror,

914
01:25:05,870 --> 01:25:08,920
内心的真我才会慢慢浮现."
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}"I see myself as I might become."

915
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:13,510
没错...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Yes.

916
01:25:15,090 --> 01:25:17,010
没错...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Yes.

917
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:21,890
魔镜, 魔镜告诉我,
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Mirror, Mirror on the wall,

918
01:25:22,890 --> 01:25:26,060
谁才是这个世界上最美丽的人.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}who is the fairest of them all?

919
01:26:48,730 --> 01:26:51,350
不用躲开我.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Do not back away from me.

920
01:26:52,650 --> 01:26:54,770
你刚才问的那个问题.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You asked a question.

921
01:26:55,650 --> 01:26:57,360
魔镜回答你了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}The Mirror has answered.

922
01:26:57,990 --> 01:27:00,110
莱维娜, 怎么会?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Ravenna, how?

923
01:27:00,820 --> 01:27:02,990
你不是已经 死了吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Are you not dead?

924
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:04,320
是.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Yes.

925
01:27:06,490 --> 01:27:07,540
也不是.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}No.

926
01:27:09,660 --> 01:27:12,620
介于两者之间.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Something in between.

927
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:17,550
你比以前更坦率了, 芙蕾雅.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You've become quite literal, Freya.

928
01:27:18,510 --> 01:27:20,590
所有人中, 你应该最清楚.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Of all people, you should know

929
01:27:21,930 --> 01:27:25,010
身体, 不过是一具躯壳.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}that is but a vessel.

930
01:27:26,890 --> 01:27:28,560
我离开了我的身体.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I left my body.

931
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:31,600
躲进了魔镜之中.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I went into the Mirror.

932
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:34,520
我一直在那里.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And there I stayed.

933
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:37,940
成为了魔镜的一部分.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I became part of it.

934
01:27:38,860 --> 01:27:40,070
被困在里面.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Trapped.

935
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:43,780
直到你刚才释放了我.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Until you released me.

936
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:51,160
我们还有很多事要做, 我的好妹妹.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}We have much to do, little sister.

937
01:27:51,910 --> 01:27:54,960
只要有了你 以及你的军队.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}With you and your army by my side,

938
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:57,750
我一定能收复我的王国.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I will regain my kingdom once more.

939
01:27:59,090 --> 01:28:01,470
白雪公主
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Snow White

940
01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:03,970
我会让你跪在我的面前.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}shall kneel before me.

941
01:28:07,350 --> 01:28:09,970
她会求我饶恕她.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}She will beg for mercy.

942
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:14,350
而我终将掏出她的那颗心.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And then I'll tear her heart out.

943
01:28:21,070 --> 01:28:23,860
比我想像中大多了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Oh, that's a bit bigger than I imagined.

944
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:26,320
我们的计划是?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}So what's the plan?

945
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:30,290
我们有计划对吧?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You have got a plan?

946
01:28:30,910 --> 01:28:32,040
对.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Aye.

947
01:28:32,580 --> 01:28:33,620
那计划周全吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Is it any good?

948
01:28:34,290 --> 01:28:35,330
不.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}No.

949
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:37,210
不过很简单.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}But it's simple.

950
01:28:37,790 --> 01:28:40,840
芙蕾雅会在尖塔的密室里.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Freya will be in her sanctum, below the steeple.

951
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:44,300
我会想办法从上面爬上去, 进而杀了她.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I'll make my way down from the top, find her, and kill her.

952
01:28:44,510 --> 01:28:46,090
那莱恩和多琳娜怎么办?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What about Nion and Doreena?

953
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:49,100
会有人进去帮我们找到他们的.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I've got someone on the inside who's gonna help me find them.

954
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:50,890
- 哦, 谁啊? - 你们.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Who? You.

955
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:55,940
你给我的猎人军团下了新的命令.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You have given my Huntsmen new orders.

956
01:28:57,690 --> 01:28:58,940
更好的命令.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Better orders.

957
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,900
明天会有两组人同时出击.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}We will attack tomorrow in two waves.

958
01:29:02,990 --> 01:29:04,280
兵分两路进攻.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Flanking maneuver.

959
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:06,280
我相信你会同意的.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I presumed you would agree.

960
01:29:06,450 --> 01:29:08,740
我的谋略更胜你一筹.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}It's a far superior tactic.

961
01:29:08,910 --> 01:29:10,490
这是我的王国!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}This is my kingdom.

962
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:13,410
你刚才说什么?这是我的王国!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Did you say something? This is my kingdom!

963
01:29:14,910 --> 01:29:16,710
当然是你的.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Of course it is.

964
01:29:18,210 --> 01:29:20,170
这里永远都会是你的王国.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And it always will be.

965
01:29:21,250 --> 01:29:24,210
我永远不会质疑我妹妹的统治权.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I would never question my sister's rule.

966
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:28,140
可是在这围墙外面,
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}But beyond these walls

967
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,310
就是我的王国.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}is my kingdom.

968
01:29:35,060 --> 01:29:36,890
我说了算.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}My dominion.

969
01:29:39,020 --> 01:29:41,650
你别忘了你欠我的一切.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Do not forget what you owe me.

970
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:44,650
是我成就了今天的你.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I made you what you are.

971
01:29:50,910 --> 01:29:53,910
来吧. 往前走.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Come on. Move along. Faster.

972
01:29:54,830 --> 01:29:56,160
快点 跟上.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Follow your brother.

973
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:03,050
向前走, 快跟上.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Look lively now.

974
01:30:04,550 --> 01:30:06,590
你, 跟上. 动作快.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You as well. Go on.

975
01:30:07,550 --> 01:30:08,880
靠拢
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Shut it.

976
01:30:09,550 --> 01:30:12,010
靠拢.愚蠢地人
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Stop sniveling. Twerp.

977
01:30:14,470 --> 01:30:15,680
别停下.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Keep walking.

978
01:30:16,270 --> 01:30:17,770
千万别停下.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Just keep walking.

979
01:30:31,370 --> 01:30:33,780
这件事不能怪我妹妹, 大人.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}It's not my sister's fault, my lord.

980
01:30:33,870 --> 01:30:37,160
小的时候她的脸被东西砸过, 一大块石头.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}She was hit in the face as a baby with a rock.

981
01:30:40,580 --> 01:30:41,830
你们俩, 跟我走.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You two, come with me.

982
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:06,610
- 你非得下那么重的手吗? - 闭嘴.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Did you have to hit him so hard? Shut up.

983
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:16,740
这家伙真沉.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}He's very heavy.

984
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:19,200
好了. 把他塞进这里.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Right.

985
01:31:19,790 --> 01:31:22,580
就没人会看到了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}We stuff him in here, we cover our tracks.

986
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:34,340
你这活干得真是太粗糙了, 就那样.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}That's very sloppy work, that is.

987
01:33:00,260 --> 01:33:02,430
这真是有史以来最蠢的计划.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}This is the worst plan ever.

988
01:33:15,730 --> 01:33:16,730
停下
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Stop.

989
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:31,460
你不记得我了吗？
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You don't remember me, do you?

990
01:33:34,790 --> 01:33:35,790
不记得呀
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}No.

991
01:33:38,300 --> 01:33:40,010
这是我的战争
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}This is my war face.

992
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:43,470
皮帕
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Pippa.

993
01:33:47,140 --> 01:33:49,100
我知道你为什么在这里
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I know why you're here.

994
01:33:56,110 --> 01:33:57,400
你真正的目标.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Aim true.

995
01:33:58,190 --> 01:33:59,940
我的孩子们。
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}My children.

996
01:34:01,820 --> 01:34:04,410
为了这一天的到来...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}This is the day for which...

997
01:34:05,660 --> 01:34:07,830
什么叫做害怕.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}For which you were born.

998
01:34:09,660 --> 01:34:12,870
你们将面对的敌人 他们从未输过一场战争.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You will face an army of men who have never lost a war,

999
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:14,420
是从未...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}men who have...

1000
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,090
他们忘记了...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Who have forgotten...

1001
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,840
…什么是害怕
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}...what it means to be afraid.

1002
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:30,180
而我们会让他们...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}We will bring fear

1003
01:34:30,930 --> 01:34:32,640
再一次
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}once again

1004
01:34:32,810 --> 01:34:33,980
白雪公主的军队
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}to Snow White's army.

1005
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:35,770
再次害怕... 白雪公主的军队
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And their lands will be mine.

1006
01:34:35,850 --> 01:34:37,360
还有他们的王国, 而他们的孩子...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And their children...

1007
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:42,320
他们的孩子...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Their children...

1008
01:34:46,870 --> 01:34:48,620
我是这里的女王.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}For I am queen.

1009
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:52,830
我是你们的女王.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}lam queen.

1010
01:34:57,290 --> 01:34:59,840
为了今天我不断训练你们.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}This is what I trained you for.

1011
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:02,090
为了今天我栽培了你们.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}This is why I raised you.

1012
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:09,140
所以你们才能成为我的猎人军团.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}This is why I made you what you are.

1013
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:20,560
你好吗, 艾力.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Hello, Eric.

1014
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:25,690
我可想死你了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I've missed you.

1015
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:38,410
侍卫!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Guard!

1016
01:35:41,450 --> 01:35:42,580
为什么?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Why?

1017
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:45,040
为什么?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Why?

1018
01:35:46,290 --> 01:35:48,040
因为他们相爱.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}They're in love.

1019
01:35:49,460 --> 01:35:51,210
你闻不出臭味吗.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}They reek of it.

1020
01:35:56,420 --> 01:35:59,340
这里难道不是你的王国吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Is this not your kingdom?

1021
01:36:00,050 --> 01:36:01,100
当然是.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}It is.

1022
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,970
那你没立下国法吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Do you not have laws?

1023
01:36:04,890 --> 01:36:06,140
我有.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I do.

1024
01:36:10,650 --> 01:36:11,940
那么...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Then what

1025
01:36:13,230 --> 01:36:15,190
该如何处置他们?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}is your judgment?

1026
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:19,820
死刑.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Death.

1027
01:36:21,620 --> 01:36:22,830
嗯
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Mmm.

1028
01:36:41,890 --> 01:36:42,970
叛徒!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Traitors!

1029
01:36:43,050 --> 01:36:44,600
背叛了谁?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Traitors to who?

1030
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:47,060
你们的老女王? 还是新女王?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Your old queen? Your new queen?

1031
01:36:47,230 --> 01:36:48,810
你触犯了法令
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You broke the law.

1032
01:36:48,890 --> 01:36:49,850
法令吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}The law?

1033
01:36:49,940 --> 01:36:52,230
你忘了那些爱你的人吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Have you forgotten the ones who loved you?

1034
01:36:52,310 --> 01:36:53,730
你们的母亲, 你们的父亲
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Your mothers, your fathers.

1035
01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:55,280
他们也犯法了吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What law did they break?

1036
01:36:55,940 --> 01:36:57,690
爱并不会让你们软弱.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Love does not make you weak.

1037
01:36:57,780 --> 01:37:00,030
相反的它给我力量.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}It's all that ever gave me strength.

1038
01:37:00,110 --> 01:37:01,950
塔尔 我们不曾并肩作战吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Tull, have we not fought side by side?

1039
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:03,700
我们的孩提时代!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}We were children!

1040
01:37:04,620 --> 01:37:06,740
兄弟姐妹, 难道不是彼此相爱吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Brothers and sisters. Did we not love each other?

1041
01:37:07,910 --> 01:37:08,960
和我一起战斗.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Fight with me.

1042
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:11,460
即使死, 也是为了爱你的人.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}If you die, you die for something that's yours.

1043
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:27,770
你为什么不敢看我们, 芙蕾雅?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Why do you turn away, Freya?

1044
01:37:27,850 --> 01:37:29,560
当年你骗了我们, 现在又要骗你自己吗.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You deceived us, and now you deceive yourself.

1045
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:30,690
给我安静
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Silence.

1046
01:37:30,770 --> 01:37:32,690
当时为什么不杀了我们?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Why did you not kill us back then?

1047
01:37:32,770 --> 01:37:35,110
而是让我心死 让她恨透了我.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Instead, you break my heart and turn hers against me.

1048
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:07,180
很漂亮.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Pretty.

1049
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:13,690
看到了吗, 猎人.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You see, Huntsman,

1050
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,610
爱情救不了你们的命.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}love doesn't save your life.

1051
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:20,110
我早就知道.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I should know.

1052
01:38:25,570 --> 01:38:27,660
因为我也死过一次.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I've been dead before.

1053
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:06,240
对不起.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I'm sorry.

1054
01:39:06,910 --> 01:39:08,580
真的对不起.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I'm so sorry.

1055
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:11,580
无论生死.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Stand or fall.

1056
01:39:12,250 --> 01:39:13,250
都要在一起.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Together.

1057
01:39:31,060 --> 01:39:32,720
- 我们并肩作战.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I stand with you. Aye.

1058
01:39:32,890 --> 01:39:35,100
- 对
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Aye.

1059
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:37,310
别动.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Don't.

1060
01:39:49,660 --> 01:39:50,660
往后退!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Stand back.

1061
01:39:52,990 --> 01:39:55,460
没人救得了你, 猎人.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Nothing can save you, Huntsman.

1062
01:39:57,080 --> 01:39:58,540
只会让你死的 更痛苦 !
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}All that's left is pain!

1063
01:40:04,010 --> 01:40:05,590
莱维娜, 快住手. 快停下!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Ravenna, stop. Stop!

1064
01:40:12,100 --> 01:40:13,260
我说够了 !
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Enough!

1065
01:40:30,660 --> 01:40:31,700
我们不能把魔镜留在这里.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}We can't leave the Mirror.

1066
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:34,040
我们爬上去.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Then we climb.

1067
01:40:35,660 --> 01:40:39,330
我以为我已抹杀了你软弱的一面.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I thought I had driven the weakness out of you.

1068
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:41,710
我以为我让你变得更强.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I thought I made you strong.

1069
01:40:43,380 --> 01:40:46,260
可你还是那么可悲 就像当年一样.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}But you're as pathetic as you ever were.

1070
01:41:00,190 --> 01:41:01,770
你是不是疯了?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Have you lost your mind?

1071
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:07,360
你是怎么让我变得更强的?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}How did you make me strong?

1072
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:12,160
又是怎么抹杀我软弱的一面?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}How did you draw the weakness out?

1073
01:41:14,580 --> 01:41:15,580
你做了什么?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What did you do?

1074
01:41:18,710 --> 01:41:21,750
你做了什么?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}What did you do?

1075
01:41:25,210 --> 01:41:28,380
我没必要向你交代任何事.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I don't have to tell you anything.

1076
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:31,470
哦. 哦, 可怕的是你做了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Oh. Oh, but you do.

1077
01:41:32,140 --> 01:41:33,430
你看, 你自己也说了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You see, you said it yourself,

1078
01:41:33,510 --> 01:41:36,220
你的存在介于这个世界和魔镜之间.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}you're something between this world and the Mirror.

1079
01:41:36,970 --> 01:41:39,140
是我把你召换出来.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I summoned you out.

1080
01:41:39,230 --> 01:41:42,270
现在, 你得听从我的命令!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Now you are bound to me!

1081
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:44,690
快告诉我真相.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Tell me the truth.

1082
01:41:47,110 --> 01:41:50,740
魔镜, 魔镜 告诉我
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Mirror, Mirror on the wall...

1083
01:41:51,950 --> 01:41:55,320
谁才是这个世界上最美丽的人?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}...who is the fairest of them all?

1084
01:41:56,240 --> 01:41:58,410
是你, 女王陛下.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You are, my queen.

1085
01:41:58,490 --> 01:42:00,250
可不久之后.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}But not for long.

1086
01:42:00,710 --> 01:42:04,580
你的妹妹即将诞下一名婴儿.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Your sister holds a baby to her breast.

1087
01:42:04,670 --> 01:42:05,920
是个女娃.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}A daughter.

1088
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:10,840
当这个女娃长大之后 自然就会超越你的美丽了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}She will grow to be more beautiful than even you.

1089
01:42:17,890 --> 01:42:19,770
你不能要求我做这些事情.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You cannot ask such a thing of me.

1090
01:42:20,810 --> 01:42:23,020
这并不是我的要求.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I ask nothing.

1091
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:25,900
我只不过是你内心的反射.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I am but a reflection.

1092
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:27,770
而其实你...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And you...

1093
01:42:27,860 --> 01:42:30,650
你的内心早已做出决定.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You have already decided.

1094
01:42:33,030 --> 01:42:34,490
杀...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Kill.

1095
01:42:36,780 --> 01:42:37,950
杀...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Kill.

1096
01:42:42,330 --> 01:42:44,710
给我杀...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Kill for me.

1097
01:43:13,990 --> 01:43:15,820
我是那么爱她.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Yeah, I loved her.

1098
01:43:19,030 --> 01:43:20,790
我是那么爱你.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I loved you.

1099
01:43:29,250 --> 01:43:31,170
所以我才会比你更强大!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}That's why I'm stronger than you.

1100
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:54,030
离我的孩子们远点!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Leave my children alone!

1101
01:45:00,010 --> 01:45:01,010
对不起.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I'm sorry.

1102
01:45:02,260 --> 01:45:03,760
我对不起你.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I'm sorry

1103
01:45:05,010 --> 01:45:06,720
我杀了你的女儿.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I killed your daughter

1104
01:45:07,770 --> 01:45:11,770
同时也释放出在你内心隐藏的力量.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}and released the greatest power within you.

1105
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:16,480
可你却把你强大的力量浪费在愚蠢的感情上!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}A power you have wasted on nothing but cheap sentiment!

1106
01:45:18,820 --> 01:45:20,610
你以为我不想要孩子吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Did you not think I wanted a child?

1107
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:23,320
你以为我不想得到爱吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Did you not think I wanted love?

1108
01:45:23,950 --> 01:45:25,910
不过这些东西...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}But these things

1109
01:45:25,990 --> 01:45:27,830
... 对我并不重要.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}were not meant for me.

1110
01:45:29,210 --> 01:45:31,420
因为我有更大的梦想!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I have a higher calling!

1111
01:45:38,420 --> 01:45:40,340
你依然相信...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Do you still believe

1112
01:45:41,180 --> 01:45:43,970
... 爱情能对抗一切吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}that love conquers all?

1113
01:45:44,930 --> 01:45:46,560
即使不是一切.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Maybe not all.

1114
01:45:47,810 --> 01:45:48,810
至少是你.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Just you.

1115
01:45:49,930 --> 01:45:51,560
准备好了吗, 猎人?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Are you ready, Huntsman?

1116
01:45:52,140 --> 01:45:53,480
来啊.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Aye.

1117
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:49,970
你们是多么的幸运.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}How lucky you are.

1118
01:48:04,650 --> 01:48:06,200
来吧.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Come on.

1119
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:19,960
呼吸. 哦, 呼吸.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Freed.

1120
01:48:26,550 --> 01:48:27,550
我没事呢.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}I'm all right.

1121
01:48:33,390 --> 01:48:34,720
- 你没事吧? - 你也没事吧?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Are you all right? Are you all right?

1122
01:48:34,810 --> 01:48:35,810
- 没错. - 没错.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Yeah. Yeah.

1123
01:48:39,810 --> 01:48:41,860
你看, 是太阳!
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Yeah! Hey look, the sun!

1124
01:48:56,160 --> 01:48:59,830
很久很久以前, 有一个美丽的女王,
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Once upon a time there lived a beautiful queen

1125
01:49:00,670 --> 01:49:03,130
她的心碎成了两半.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}whose heart was broken in two.

1126
01:49:08,090 --> 01:49:10,720
虽然被埋葬在冰雪之下...
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}But even buried under ice and snow,

1127
01:49:12,850 --> 01:49:15,310
但她的爱永续存在.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}love survives.

1128
01:49:34,530 --> 01:49:36,540
- 这辈子你都别想. - 好吧. 好吧. 好吧.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}Not on your life. Fine, fine.

1129
01:49:38,660 --> 01:49:40,000
你这么容易就放弃了吗?
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}You're gonna give up that easily?

1130
01:49:42,710 --> 01:49:44,080
天啊, 你真是蠢到家了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}God, you're stupid.

1131
01:49:58,350 --> 01:50:00,390
北方的冰雪渐渐融化.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}The lands of the North were free

1132
01:50:00,980 --> 01:50:04,730
白雪公主的王国也避免了一场战争.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}and Snow White's kingdom was safe from harm.

1133
01:50:08,230 --> 01:50:11,860
最后, 一些童话确实成真了.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}And so, some fairy tales do come true.

1134
01:50:12,530 --> 01:50:15,320
而他们的故事 仍然继续.
{\b1\fs13\c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H000000&\fn黑体}But none ever truly end.
