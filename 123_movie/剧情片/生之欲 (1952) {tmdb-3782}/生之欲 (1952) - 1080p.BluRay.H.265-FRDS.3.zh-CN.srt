12
00:02:09,777 --> 00:02:14,510
This stomach belongs to
the protagonist of our story.

13
00:02:15,216 --> 00:02:20,984
At this point, our protagonist
has no idea he has this cancer...

PUBLIC AFFAIRS
SECTION CHIEF

15
00:02:50,485 --> 00:02:52,385
My child has sensitive skin,

16
00:02:52,954 --> 00:02:55,445
and that water gave him an awful rash.
PUBLIC AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT

17
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,885
Plus it breeds mosquitoes like crazy.

18
00:02:58,092 --> 00:02:59,753
And it stinks, besides.

19
00:03:00,595 --> 00:03:05,794
Can't you do something? It would make
a great playground if you filled it in.

20
00:03:07,302 --> 00:03:08,826
Please wait a moment.

21
00:03:16,611 --> 00:03:20,047
Sir, they've come to complain
about a sewage pond.

22
00:03:20,248 --> 00:03:22,045
- Engineering Section.
- Yes.

23
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:31,284
Ah, here is our protagonist now.

24
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:36,028
But it would only be tiresome
to meet him right now.

25
00:03:36,264 --> 00:03:37,925
After all,

26
00:03:38,132 --> 00:03:43,968
he's simply passing time
without actually living his life.

27
00:03:44,238 --> 00:03:47,605
In other words,
he's not really even alive.

28
00:03:56,918 --> 00:03:58,579
Odagiri,

29
00:03:58,786 --> 00:04:01,118
how dare you,
during business hours?

30
00:04:01,322 --> 00:04:02,653
But it's so funny.

31
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,653
Funny? What is?

32
00:04:04,892 --> 00:04:07,884
It's the "Liar's Club".
Someone sent it around.

33
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,730
Read it to us.

34
00:04:16,137 --> 00:04:19,402
"I hear you've never even
taken a vacation.

35
00:04:19,607 --> 00:04:23,270
Is that because City Hall
couldn't function without you?"

36
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:29,417
"No, because everyone would realize
that City Hall doesn't need me at all".

37
00:04:42,397 --> 00:04:45,696
Oh, no, this will never do.

38
00:04:45,933 --> 00:04:48,493
He might as well be a corpse.

39
00:04:48,703 --> 00:04:54,141
In fact, this man has been dead
for more than 20 years now.

40
00:04:54,842 --> 00:04:57,777
Before that, he did live a little.

41
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:01,471
He even actually tried
to do real work.

42
00:05:06,654 --> 00:05:10,488
A PROPOSAL FOR INCREASING
DEPARTMENTAL EFFICIENCY

43
00:05:10,658 --> 00:05:12,626
SUBMITTED 1930

44
00:05:15,363 --> 00:05:19,800
But now, there's barely a trace of
his old passion and ambition.

45
00:05:20,101 --> 00:05:26,939
He's been worn down completely by
the minutia of the bureaucratic machine

46
00:05:27,108 --> 00:05:30,737
and the meaningless busyness
it breeds.

47
00:05:35,716 --> 00:05:38,048
Busy, always so very busy.

48
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,084
But in fact, this man does
absolutely nothing at all.

49
00:05:43,324 --> 00:05:46,691
Other than protecting
his own spot.

50
00:05:46,894 --> 00:05:52,389
The best way to protect your place
in this world is to do nothing at all.

51
00:05:54,936 --> 00:05:57,666
Is this really
what life is all about?

52
00:06:03,344 --> 00:06:05,778
Is this really
what life is all about?

53
00:06:06,881 --> 00:06:10,180
Before our friend will
take this question seriously,

54
00:06:10,384 --> 00:06:13,683
his stomach has
to get a lot worse,

55
00:06:13,888 --> 00:06:18,689
and he'll have to waste much,
much more time.

56
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,127
But any proposal
for creating a park

57
00:06:23,364 --> 00:06:25,525
goes to the Parks Department.

58
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:29,569
This really seems to be
a question of hygiene,

59
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,466
so you'd better try
the Health Department.

60
00:06:32,807 --> 00:06:35,071
Go to the Sanitation Department.

61
00:06:35,276 --> 00:06:37,073
See Environmental Sanitation.

62
00:06:37,912 --> 00:06:39,812
Department of Prevention.

63
00:06:40,047 --> 00:06:41,912
Infectious Diseases.

64
00:06:42,116 --> 00:06:44,107
Lots of mosquitoes?

65
00:06:44,318 --> 00:06:47,344
That's a job for
the Division of Pest Control.

66
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:54,951
The problem is seeping waste,
which means

67
00:06:55,663 --> 00:06:59,429
it's a problem for
the Sewage Department at City Hall.

68
00:07:00,268 --> 00:07:06,366
Originally, it was a ditch
with a road running over it,

69
00:07:06,774 --> 00:07:08,765
which means the Roads Department.

70
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:13,476
We're waiting on a decision
from City Planning.

71
00:07:13,681 --> 00:07:15,046
Go to Ward Reorganization.

72
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:20,810
The Fire Department objected
to draining that cesspool.

73
00:07:21,756 --> 00:07:24,725
There are water pressure problems
in that area.

74
00:07:24,892 --> 00:07:28,828
Are you kidding?
All we need's a good water supply.

75
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:33,262
There's no reason it has to
breed mosquitoes and cause rashes.

76
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:37,494
Think what a time we'd have
getting that filth out of our hoses.

77
00:07:37,705 --> 00:07:42,768
Of course, we'd love a kiddie pool
in that neighborhood.

78
00:07:43,377 --> 00:07:49,475
Try the Education Department. They
should have a Child Welfare Committee.

79
00:07:50,685 --> 00:07:54,883
But the problem doesn't only
affect children.

80
00:07:55,122 --> 00:07:59,491
We've had enough trouble
just rebuilding all the schools.

81
00:07:59,694 --> 00:08:05,655
A problem this big belongs with your
Ward Representative to the City Council.

82
00:08:05,866 --> 00:08:09,666
I'll give you an introduction
to the Deputy Mayor.

83
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:13,499
Show him my card
and he'll meet with you immediately.

84
00:08:15,343 --> 00:08:17,834
Please, sit down.

85
00:08:18,045 --> 00:08:21,242
Thank you for all your hard work.

86
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:25,113
The truth is that we truly appreciate

87
00:08:25,286 --> 00:08:29,484
folks like you,
who know to bring

88
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,853
such complaints directly
to our attention.

89
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:38,862
That's precisely what inspired
our new Department of Public Affairs.

90
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,700
Don't skimp on your complaints.

91
00:08:41,902 --> 00:08:44,928
Hey, you. Show these folks
the Public Affairs desk.

92
00:08:46,273 --> 00:08:50,209
You'll need to take that up
with Engineering. Desk 8.

93
00:09:00,955 --> 00:09:04,413
How dare you?
Stop giving us the runaround.

94
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:08,823
What the hell's this poster mean?
To help us kill time?

95
00:09:08,996 --> 00:09:11,897
We call people like you time-killers.

96
00:09:12,099 --> 00:09:16,536
All we want is to get
that stinking cesspool cleaned up.

97
00:09:16,737 --> 00:09:21,902
If it's Engineering, Sewage,
Health, Sanitation or the Fire Department,

98
00:09:22,109 --> 00:09:24,168
Public Affairs should sort it out.

99
00:09:24,345 --> 00:09:26,905
Forget it.
We won't bother you anymore.

100
00:09:27,114 --> 00:09:31,050
You're just laughing at us.
What a mockery of democracy.

101
00:09:31,252 --> 00:09:32,719
Let's go.

102
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:49,232
Um, excuse me.

103
00:09:50,037 --> 00:09:53,529
Unfortunately, the section chief
took the day off,

104
00:09:53,741 --> 00:09:57,507
and it'd be easier for us
if you'd put this in writing.

105
00:10:08,322 --> 00:10:10,552
PUBLIC AFFAIRS
SECTION CHIEF

106
00:10:14,395 --> 00:10:16,260
What do you think?

107
00:10:16,464 --> 00:10:19,956
The section chief
never takes days off.

108
00:10:20,768 --> 00:10:23,703
Yes, he's been
kind of listless recently.

109
00:10:24,772 --> 00:10:28,868
But we really can't have him
taking extended time off.

110
00:10:29,143 --> 00:10:34,410
Exactly. It's not like him to take
a day off over a little cold.

111
00:10:35,082 --> 00:10:37,209
Nothing moves unless he stamps it.

112
00:10:37,384 --> 00:10:38,578
Yes, you're right.

113
00:10:40,254 --> 00:10:44,247
I must say,
it's a terrible shame.

114
00:10:44,892 --> 00:10:46,757
One more month

115
00:10:46,961 --> 00:10:51,728
and he'd have broken the record of
30 years without a single absence.

116
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,496
Trust me, some people are
happy to have him gone.

117
00:10:55,669 --> 00:11:00,572
Only a bureaucrat schemes
to replace his boss as soon as he's out.

118
00:11:04,145 --> 00:11:06,705
What's that medicine
he's been taking?

119
00:11:06,914 --> 00:11:11,408
Stomach medicine. He always slurped
his noodle bowl to the bottom,

120
00:11:11,619 --> 00:11:14,645
but lately, he barely touches it.

121
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:20,850
Plain noodle soup. In all these years,
I've never seen him eat anything else.

122
00:11:21,962 --> 00:11:25,398
And if the worst happens,
who'll replace him?

123
00:11:27,802 --> 00:11:32,739
What's the rush? Lots more guys
have to die before it's your turn.

124
00:11:41,715 --> 00:11:44,809
X-RAY LAB

125
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,666
- Hiraoka-san...
- Yes.

126
00:12:38,772 --> 00:12:40,364
Your stomach?

127
00:12:43,777 --> 00:12:48,180
Yeah, my stomach's bad, too.
It's what they call "chronic".

128
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:54,310
These days I hardly feel alive
unless my stomach hurts.

129
00:12:56,357 --> 00:12:58,951
- Suzuki-san...
- Yes.

130
00:13:02,997 --> 00:13:05,227
That man over there...

131
00:13:09,536 --> 00:13:12,733
His doctor told him
he's got an ulcer,

132
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,874
but trust me, it's stomach cancer.

133
00:13:17,344 --> 00:13:19,778
In a word, that very thing.

134
00:13:21,148 --> 00:13:25,414
And stomach cancer
is practically a death sentence.

135
00:13:25,886 --> 00:13:29,344
The doc usually says
it's just a mild ulcer,

136
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,684
and that there's
no real need to operate.

137
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:39,695
And that you can eat whatever you want
as long as it's easy to digest.

138
00:13:40,234 --> 00:13:44,330
If that's what he tells you,
you've got a year, at most.

139
00:13:44,905 --> 00:13:50,537
But if you've got these symptoms,
you won't last a year:

140
00:13:51,312 --> 00:13:55,681
First, if the pain is kind of heavy.

141
00:13:57,518 --> 00:14:01,147
Second, if you can't stop
burping unpleasantly.

142
00:14:02,523 --> 00:14:05,014
And your tongue's always dry.

143
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:08,059
You can't get enough water and tea.

144
00:14:08,729 --> 00:14:12,096
And then there's the diarrhea.

145
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:16,099
And, if it isn't diarrhea,
well, then you're constipated.

146
00:14:17,171 --> 00:14:20,072
Your bowel movements go black.

147
00:14:23,544 --> 00:14:25,569
And then,

148
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:30,409
that meat you used to love so,
you can hardly touch it anymore.

149
00:14:31,752 --> 00:14:35,188
And whatever you eat,
you vomit half an hour later.

150
00:14:35,422 --> 00:14:38,391
And when stuff you ate
last week comes up

151
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:41,619
when you vomit,
well, then you're done for.

152
00:14:41,962 --> 00:14:45,090
You've hardly got three months...

153
00:14:56,977 --> 00:15:00,606
Watanabe-san.
Watanabe Kanji-san.

154
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,280
Watanabe-san.

155
00:15:08,022 --> 00:15:09,284
Yes.

156
00:15:47,227 --> 00:15:48,227
Sit down.

157
00:15:51,598 --> 00:15:55,466
Um... it looks like
you've got a mild ulcer.

158
00:16:10,617 --> 00:16:11,617
Honestly...

159
00:16:12,786 --> 00:16:14,617
please tell me...

160
00:16:15,456 --> 00:16:17,185
the truth.

161
00:16:17,391 --> 00:16:19,859
Tell me it's stomach cancer.

162
00:16:20,661 --> 00:16:23,755
I just told you,
it's a mild ulcer.

163
00:16:45,219 --> 00:16:49,178
What about an operation?
Can't you operate?

164
00:16:49,356 --> 00:16:53,190
Oh, no, there's no need to operate.
It'll heal on its own.

165
00:16:53,927 --> 00:16:56,452
And my diet?

166
00:16:56,964 --> 00:17:02,334
Well, just use your common sense.
As long as it's easy to digest,

167
00:17:02,569 --> 00:17:04,628
you can eat whatever you like.

168
00:17:18,385 --> 00:17:20,216
Does that patient have a year?

169
00:17:20,387 --> 00:17:22,981
No, I'd give him six months.

170
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,987
- Six months?
- Yeah.

171
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:31,557
What would you do if you had only
six months left to live, like him?

172
00:17:37,471 --> 00:17:40,099
What about you, Aihara?

173
00:17:42,276 --> 00:17:44,107
The barbiturates are over there.

174
00:18:54,681 --> 00:18:55,875
Is there a blackout?

175
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,711
The street lights
and neighbors’ are lit.

176
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:01,786
How strange.
I wonder if Dad's out.

177
00:19:02,022 --> 00:19:03,114
Where's the key?

178
00:19:03,357 --> 00:19:04,756
In your handbag.

179
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:11,459
Did Hayashi-san forget to lock up
when she went home?

180
00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:14,358
She's only a part-time maid.

181
00:19:15,035 --> 00:19:19,404
Full-time would hardly break the bank,
but a thief sure would.

182
00:19:19,606 --> 00:19:23,133
That's just like Dad,
the petty bureaucrat.

183
00:19:24,811 --> 00:19:26,278
Man, it's freezing.

184
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,778
Just as cold inside as out.

185
00:19:28,982 --> 00:19:31,075
I just hate Japanese houses.

186
00:19:31,285 --> 00:19:35,949
Have a great time out and come home
to this dump. We need a modern home.

187
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,614
- Honey...
- Yeah.

188
00:19:38,325 --> 00:19:42,261
A house of our own would
cost 500,000 yen, right?

189
00:19:42,996 --> 00:19:45,556
Use father's retirement bonus
as collateral...

190
00:19:45,732 --> 00:19:49,031
Yeah, it ought to be worth
6 or 700,000 yen by now.

191
00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:52,432
Plus a monthly pension of
12 or 13,000 yen.

192
00:19:52,873 --> 00:19:55,000
And another 100,000 in savings.

193
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,937
But you think he'd agree?

194
00:19:57,144 --> 00:20:01,513
If he doesn't, we'll tell him
we're moving out. That'll clinch it.

195
00:20:01,715 --> 00:20:06,311
Besides, even Pop wouldn't want to take
all that money to his grave.

196
00:20:16,063 --> 00:20:17,963
What's wrong, Dad?

197
00:20:21,735 --> 00:20:25,671
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.

198
00:20:33,113 --> 00:20:34,842
That was strange.

199
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,842
Listen, honey.

200
00:20:38,852 --> 00:20:40,319
It's not fair.

201
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,520
What isn't?

202
00:20:41,655 --> 00:20:44,522
He heard our whole conversation.

203
00:20:45,692 --> 00:20:47,557
It's really not fair.

204
00:20:47,761 --> 00:20:50,559
It may be his house,
but this is our room.

205
00:20:50,764 --> 00:20:54,291
I can't believe he snuck in here
while we were out.

206
00:20:55,402 --> 00:20:59,361
Besides, if he's got a gripe,
he should come out with it.

207
00:20:59,573 --> 00:21:02,133
Not go around acting
like a crabby kid.

208
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,811
Stop being so moody.

209
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,153
Forget about your dad.

210
00:21:54,361 --> 00:21:57,853
He has his life.
We have ours.

211
00:22:04,971 --> 00:22:06,734
Love me.

212
00:22:27,561 --> 00:22:28,561
How sad.

213
00:22:29,896 --> 00:22:31,761
She was so young,

214
00:22:32,699 --> 00:22:36,829
and to leave such a sweet
little boy behind.

215
00:22:37,037 --> 00:22:39,335
She must have regretted dying.

216
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:43,441
Cut it out.
The same broken record.

217
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:02,126
Hurry, hurry.
Mommy's leaving.

218
00:23:23,917 --> 00:23:25,441
You can't use Mitsuo

219
00:23:25,585 --> 00:23:28,110
as an excuse
not to marry again.

220
00:23:28,321 --> 00:23:30,949
As soon as that boy grows up,

221
00:23:31,157 --> 00:23:33,955
he'll never love you
the way you loved him.

222
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,561
And when he gets married,
they'll squeeze you out.

223
00:23:37,797 --> 00:23:40,823
You've got to think about
your own future.

224
00:23:41,034 --> 00:23:44,492
I'm telling you,
find another wife now.

225
00:23:44,704 --> 00:23:46,638
Besides, my wife says,

226
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,469
the thought of you
and your oily skin

227
00:23:50,677 --> 00:23:54,511
keeping up with the laundry
is too disgusting to bear.

228
00:23:56,349 --> 00:23:58,476
Dad.

229
00:24:08,528 --> 00:24:10,325
Mitsuo.

230
00:24:12,432 --> 00:24:15,731
Good night.
You'll lock up down there, right?

231
00:25:19,933 --> 00:25:21,298
Mitsuo.

232
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,531
What do you say?
What a great hit.

233
00:25:29,709 --> 00:25:34,009
You know, the batter is my...

234
00:25:40,153 --> 00:25:42,417
Mitsuo, Mitsuo.

235
00:25:48,395 --> 00:25:49,828
That idiot.

236
00:25:50,063 --> 00:25:51,758
What's he thinking?

237
00:26:01,508 --> 00:26:03,373
Mitsuo.

238
00:26:09,983 --> 00:26:14,283
Mitsuo, be brave.
It's only your appendix.

239
00:26:14,487 --> 00:26:16,614
No worse than pulling a tooth.

240
00:26:31,237 --> 00:26:33,501
Can't you stay for the operation, Dad?

241
00:26:33,707 --> 00:26:37,666
Well, I've got some other things
to do and...

242
00:26:45,985 --> 00:26:48,283
Mitsuo, Mitsuo.

243
00:26:56,996 --> 00:27:00,693
Banzai, Banzai.

244
00:27:04,537 --> 00:27:07,529
Banzai, banzai.

245
00:27:16,249 --> 00:27:17,648
Dad.

246
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:00,206
CERTIFICATE OF APPRECIATION

247
00:30:00,413 --> 00:30:06,249
IN RECOGNITION OF 25 YEARS
OF DISTINGUISHED CIVIL SERVICE

248
00:30:12,492 --> 00:30:15,461
Watanabe-san left for work as usual.

249
00:30:15,695 --> 00:30:17,094
What?

250
00:30:19,432 --> 00:30:22,924
But he hasn't been in at all.

251
00:30:23,136 --> 00:30:26,936
It's been five days now,
but he hasn't called in sick either.

252
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:31,236
The sub-section chief asked me
to check up on him.

253
00:30:36,282 --> 00:30:39,046
Madam. Madam.

254
00:30:45,525 --> 00:30:47,015
What? Impossible.

255
00:30:47,193 --> 00:30:50,924
But it's true.
The man from his office said so.

256
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,155
What could Father be doing?

257
00:30:54,267 --> 00:30:57,168
It's incredible, but it's really true.

258
00:30:57,403 --> 00:31:01,032
The people at his house
were flabbergasted.

259
00:31:02,075 --> 00:31:03,702
What a bother.

260
00:31:04,744 --> 00:31:09,272
When the section chief s out,
I can stamp your paperwork.

261
00:31:09,482 --> 00:31:12,417
But he has to approve
any resignations, right?

262
00:31:12,618 --> 00:31:15,712
Don't tell me you want to quit?

263
00:31:15,888 --> 00:31:17,287
I don't belong here.

264
00:31:28,668 --> 00:31:32,263
Uncle, he even withdrew
50,000 yen from his account.

265
00:31:32,472 --> 00:31:34,599
That miser?

266
00:31:35,308 --> 00:31:39,335
Maybe he's got a woman.
That would be quite something.

267
00:31:39,545 --> 00:31:41,410
- Now, dear.
- Never.

268
00:31:41,581 --> 00:31:45,073
Oh, there's no telling
when it comes to love.

269
00:31:45,318 --> 00:31:48,515
The least likely ones
have the highest risk.

270
00:31:49,522 --> 00:31:54,550
If you ask me, he's actually
always been a real lech.

271
00:31:54,794 --> 00:32:00,562
What they call a sullen lech. But he's
stayed single these 20 years for you.

272
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,826
It makes sense
he'd explode sooner or later.

273
00:32:04,037 --> 00:32:07,973
Oh, no. He's lost
a lot of weight recently,

274
00:32:08,174 --> 00:32:10,904
and his skin's
strangely dry and flaky.

275
00:32:11,144 --> 00:32:13,112
I bet there's another explanation.

276
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,803
You saw him recently?

277
00:32:15,014 --> 00:32:18,780
Four days ago.
He turned up that morning.

278
00:32:18,951 --> 00:32:22,853
I thought there was definitely
something wrong.

279
00:32:23,056 --> 00:32:25,456
But you know your uncle.

280
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:29,994
He just said, "Why the glum look?
If it's a loan, forget it".

281
00:32:30,196 --> 00:32:34,599
Hey, don't tell me he had good news.
Not with that long face.

282
00:32:34,834 --> 00:32:36,825
Now, honey, it's just that

283
00:32:37,036 --> 00:32:41,700
my husband thinks all men
are self-indulgent, like him.

284
00:32:45,978 --> 00:32:50,244
Say, Mitsuo-san.
Did something happen at home?

285
00:32:51,451 --> 00:32:53,749
No... nothing in particular.

286
00:33:18,211 --> 00:33:19,610
Hey.

287
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:22,110
Deliver this to my place.

288
00:33:25,451 --> 00:33:27,646
My editor's waiting outside.

289
00:33:31,657 --> 00:33:34,956
And get some sleeping pills
at the drugstore.

290
00:33:35,161 --> 00:33:36,753
There's a prescription
in my name.

291
00:33:36,963 --> 00:33:40,091
But sir, the drugstore's
already closed.

292
00:33:40,299 --> 00:33:41,561
Is it that late?

293
00:33:41,767 --> 00:33:44,759
Around here, they close up
shop after dinner.

294
00:33:45,238 --> 00:33:46,967
What to do?

295
00:33:47,573 --> 00:33:51,976
I can't get to sleep unless
I take them with my nightcap.

296
00:33:52,178 --> 00:33:54,442
Um, I don't mean to be rude.

297
00:33:57,817 --> 00:34:01,446
But I happen to have
some sleeping pills with me.

298
00:34:19,305 --> 00:34:21,170
Well, much obliged.

299
00:34:21,807 --> 00:34:24,298
May I pay you the official price?

300
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,670
No, no.

301
00:34:27,413 --> 00:34:30,143
I was planning to throw them away.

302
00:34:32,652 --> 00:34:34,950
- But...
- No, really.

303
00:34:35,755 --> 00:34:37,382
Really?

304
00:34:38,057 --> 00:34:40,787
Then let me pick up your tab.

305
00:34:40,993 --> 00:34:42,722
Oh, no.

306
00:34:42,962 --> 00:34:44,327
You can drink, right?

307
00:34:44,697 --> 00:34:48,189
Please, have another.
You hardly seem tipsy.

308
00:34:48,401 --> 00:34:50,392
Why, thank you.

309
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:59,174
I throw up everything anyway.

310
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:05,677
In other words, my stomach...
I have stomach cancer.

311
00:35:06,252 --> 00:35:08,015
- Stomach cancer?
- Yes.

312
00:35:11,123 --> 00:35:12,954
That's a shock.

313
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,993
But then, what you're doing is crazy.

314
00:35:18,197 --> 00:35:22,395
Yes, it's embarrassing, but...

315
00:35:23,336 --> 00:35:25,099
But...

316
00:35:26,038 --> 00:35:29,906
It's suicide to drink
when you have stomach cancer.

317
00:35:33,713 --> 00:35:36,876
But... I can't die.

318
00:35:41,387 --> 00:35:44,550
I'll just up and die on them.

319
00:35:45,424 --> 00:35:47,392
I want to, but...

320
00:35:47,927 --> 00:35:50,122
I can't... die.

321
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:57,092
In other words,
I can't bring myself to die.

322
00:35:59,572 --> 00:36:04,407
I don't know what I've been doing
with my life all these years.

323
00:36:08,147 --> 00:36:09,478
No children?

324
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,151
Your stomach hurts?

325
00:36:18,124 --> 00:36:22,254
No, it's not my stomach...

326
00:36:30,469 --> 00:36:35,099
It seems you're carrying
a heavy load indeed.

327
00:36:35,308 --> 00:36:36,308
No...

328
00:36:39,979 --> 00:36:41,947
It's just...

329
00:36:42,948 --> 00:36:46,782
I'm such a fool.

330
00:36:48,821 --> 00:36:51,153
I'm just...

331
00:36:57,496 --> 00:37:00,624
so furious with myself.

332
00:37:03,436 --> 00:37:08,738
Until just a few days ago,

333
00:37:09,508 --> 00:37:14,207
I'd never even bought a drink
with my own money.

334
00:37:15,314 --> 00:37:21,514
It's only now that I don't know
how much longer I've got to live

335
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:24,114
that I finally...

336
00:37:24,323 --> 00:37:25,984
I understand.

337
00:37:26,692 --> 00:37:28,353
I understand.

338
00:37:29,061 --> 00:37:32,292
But drinking is plain crazy.

339
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:35,531
Besides, does it even taste good?

340
00:37:35,735 --> 00:37:39,171
No, it doesn't.

341
00:37:39,372 --> 00:37:40,771
But...

342
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:45,172
for a little while,
I can forget my cancer,

343
00:37:46,078 --> 00:37:49,707
and all the other painful things.

344
00:37:51,183 --> 00:37:52,548
Drinking...

345
00:37:56,555 --> 00:37:59,388
this expensive sake

346
00:38:00,593 --> 00:38:04,552
is like paying myself
back with poison

347
00:38:05,431 --> 00:38:08,889
for the way I lived all these years.

348
00:38:09,435 --> 00:38:11,130
In other words,

349
00:38:12,438 --> 00:38:13,496
I mean,

350
00:38:13,706 --> 00:38:17,073
it feels awful,

351
00:38:17,276 --> 00:38:21,474
but it feels good at the same...

352
00:38:26,786 --> 00:38:28,686
I can understand.

353
00:38:30,756 --> 00:38:33,156
Oh, why...

354
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:07,057
Actually, I...

355
00:39:07,259 --> 00:39:10,592
I have 50,000 yen here with me,

356
00:39:10,796 --> 00:39:14,698
which I'd like to spend all at once.

357
00:39:15,935 --> 00:39:19,029
But embarrassingly enough,

358
00:39:19,238 --> 00:39:23,299
the thing is, I don't even
actually know how.

359
00:39:23,542 --> 00:39:26,306
So what I'm trying to say is...

360
00:39:27,146 --> 00:39:29,910
You want me to show you
how to spend it?

361
00:39:30,483 --> 00:39:34,783
Yes, I realize
it's terribly forward of me...

362
00:39:39,024 --> 00:39:40,616
But...

363
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:45,763
No, this money...

364
00:39:55,107 --> 00:39:59,407
It took me dozens of years
to set aside this money.

365
00:40:01,146 --> 00:40:05,810
All the more reason now to...
What I'm trying to say...

366
00:40:06,018 --> 00:40:07,542
I understand.

367
00:40:08,053 --> 00:40:11,147
But please put your money away.

368
00:40:11,357 --> 00:40:12,790
Tonight's on me.

369
00:40:12,992 --> 00:40:14,425
But that's not... I...

370
00:40:14,627 --> 00:40:17,357
Just leave things to me.

371
00:40:33,279 --> 00:40:35,110
Truly fascinating...

372
00:40:36,215 --> 00:40:39,514
I realize it's rude
to call you fascinating,

373
00:40:39,718 --> 00:40:43,245
but you're an extremely
rare individual.

374
00:40:43,989 --> 00:40:49,017
I'm a half-baked fool
who writes meaningless novels.

375
00:40:49,328 --> 00:40:51,956
You've really made me think tonight.

376
00:41:05,411 --> 00:41:10,348
I realize what they say about
the nobility of misfortune is true.

377
00:41:10,549 --> 00:41:13,609
Because misfortune
teaches us the truth.

378
00:41:13,786 --> 00:41:17,552
Your cancer has opened your eyes
to your own life.

379
00:41:25,564 --> 00:41:28,761
We humans are so careless.

380
00:41:29,134 --> 00:41:34,504
We only realize how beautiful life is
when we chance upon death.

381
00:41:34,773 --> 00:41:37,901
But few of us are actually able
to face death.

382
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:41,443
The worst ones know nothing of life
'til they die.

383
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,639
You're splendid.
Rebelling against life at your age.

384
00:41:45,818 --> 00:41:48,651
Your rebellious spirit moves me.

385
00:41:48,821 --> 00:41:53,724
You were a slave to your own life.
Now you will become its master.

386
00:41:53,926 --> 00:41:57,327
I'm telling you, it's our human duty
to enjoy life.

387
00:41:57,496 --> 00:42:00,693
Wasting it,
you desecrate God's great gift.

388
00:42:00,899 --> 00:42:03,891
We've got to be greedy
about living.

389
00:42:04,103 --> 00:42:08,472
We learned that greed is a vice,
but that's old. Greed is a virtue.

390
00:42:08,707 --> 00:42:11,870
Especially this greediness for life.

391
00:42:12,077 --> 00:42:14,375
Let's go.

392
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:21,583
Let us go reclaim the life
you have wasted.

393
00:42:21,787 --> 00:42:26,224
Tonight it will be my pleasure
to act as your Mephistopheles.

394
00:42:26,425 --> 00:42:30,122
A good Mephistopheles
who seeks no reward.

395
00:42:33,098 --> 00:42:36,727
With a black dog to guide us.
Show us the way.

396
00:42:41,974 --> 00:42:43,032
Listen.

397
00:42:43,208 --> 00:42:45,699
These silver balls, they're you.

398
00:42:45,878 --> 00:42:47,812
They're your life itself.

399
00:42:48,013 --> 00:42:52,279
This machine liberates people
who strangle themselves

400
00:42:52,484 --> 00:42:57,649
in their daily lives. A vending
machine of dreams and infatuations.

401
00:43:43,035 --> 00:43:44,832
Over here, sweetie.

402
00:44:08,026 --> 00:44:09,584
- Not so fast.
- But...

403
00:44:09,828 --> 00:44:14,265
You don't know, but these women are
the greediest of all mammals.

404
00:44:17,035 --> 00:44:21,529
It'll cost you close to a dozen hats
to get that old one back.

405
00:44:27,579 --> 00:44:32,346
Besides, it's time to buy a new hat
to switch to a new self.

406
00:44:54,807 --> 00:44:56,035
Welcome.

407
00:44:58,644 --> 00:45:01,738
Welcome.
We haven't seen you in a while.

408
00:45:09,588 --> 00:45:11,613
The same for your friend?

409
00:45:24,369 --> 00:45:26,394
What are you laughing at?

410
00:45:26,672 --> 00:45:29,664
It's the honest truth.
He really has cancer.

411
00:45:30,008 --> 00:45:32,533
- Then why's he drinking?
- You idiot.

412
00:45:32,711 --> 00:45:35,441
That's why you'll never get it.

413
00:45:35,681 --> 00:45:39,310
Ecce homo.
Behold this man.

414
00:45:39,818 --> 00:45:43,549
This man bears a cross called cancer.
He's Christ.

415
00:45:44,289 --> 00:45:48,225
If you were diagnosed with cancer,
you'd die on the spot.

416
00:45:48,794 --> 00:45:54,096
But not this fellow.
That's the moment he started living.

417
00:45:54,366 --> 00:45:56,095
Right? Isn't that so?

418
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,856
Listen, the thing is,
that's the etiquette.

419
00:46:52,057 --> 00:46:54,719
Listen, you, over here, here.

420
00:48:18,143 --> 00:48:21,579
Anybody want to request a favorite?

421
00:48:22,647 --> 00:48:24,478
"Life is Brief".

422
00:48:24,783 --> 00:48:25,841
What?

423
00:48:27,219 --> 00:48:29,153
"Life is Brief".

424
00:48:29,354 --> 00:48:33,620
Fall in love, maidens

425
00:48:33,825 --> 00:48:37,488
Oh, that love song from back
in the nineteen teens.

426
00:49:05,957 --> 00:49:13,557
Life is brief

427
00:49:14,633 --> 00:49:20,469
Fall in love, maidens

428
00:49:23,842 --> 00:49:31,510
Before the crimson bloom

429
00:49:32,751 --> 00:49:38,280
Fades from your lips

430
00:49:42,561 --> 00:49:50,058
Before the tides of passion

431
00:49:51,136 --> 00:49:56,938
Cool within you

432
00:50:00,078 --> 00:50:07,041
For those of you

433
00:50:08,353 --> 00:50:14,417
Who know no tomorrow

434
00:50:17,529 --> 00:50:25,561
Life is brief

435
00:50:26,738 --> 00:50:32,768
Fall in love, maidens

436
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:42,844
Before your raven tresses

437
00:50:43,989 --> 00:50:49,518
Begin to fade

438
00:50:52,164 --> 00:50:59,866
Before the flames in your hearts

439
00:51:01,006 --> 00:51:06,945
Flicker and die

440
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:17,151
For those to whom

441
00:51:18,056 --> 00:51:24,188
Today will never return

442
00:51:31,169 --> 00:51:33,797
That's the spirit, man.

443
00:51:35,941 --> 00:51:41,971
Life is brief

444
00:52:27,525 --> 00:52:32,360
Striptease.
Now, this is what I call art.

445
00:52:32,664 --> 00:52:36,862
No, it's more than art.
It's more direct.

446
00:52:37,402 --> 00:52:40,496
In other words, that female body

447
00:52:40,672 --> 00:52:44,267
gently undulating up there
on stage is a juicy steak,

448
00:52:44,809 --> 00:52:47,277
a glass of liquor,
a bottle of camphor,

449
00:52:47,479 --> 00:52:49,572
streptomycin, uranium...

450
00:55:23,902 --> 00:55:25,301
Please, stop.

451
00:55:26,571 --> 00:55:28,471
Hey, stop the car.

452
00:55:42,287 --> 00:55:43,845
What? Had enough?

453
00:55:44,055 --> 00:55:45,920
I think he's throwing up.

454
00:55:52,263 --> 00:55:54,595
What a drag.

455
00:56:51,789 --> 00:56:55,589
Say, let's sing something.
I hate feeling blue.

456
00:56:56,294 --> 00:56:59,661
C'mon a my house
a my house

457
00:56:59,898 --> 00:57:03,561
I'm gonna give you
a Christmas tree

458
00:57:04,168 --> 00:57:07,467
C'mon a my house
a my house

459
00:57:07,672 --> 00:57:13,269
I'm gonna give you a marriage ring
and a pomegranate too

460
00:57:13,645 --> 00:57:16,944
C'mon a my house
a my house

461
00:57:21,252 --> 00:57:24,744
C'mon a my house
a my house

462
00:57:24,956 --> 00:57:30,553
I'm gonna give you a peach and a pear
I love your hair

463
00:58:04,162 --> 00:58:05,925
Section Chief.

464
00:58:16,908 --> 00:58:18,307
I thought it was you.

465
00:58:27,151 --> 00:58:30,086
I hardly recognized you
in that new hat.

466
00:58:38,363 --> 00:58:41,196
But I'm glad.
I was looking for your place.

467
00:58:41,399 --> 00:58:43,367
Are you off to work?

468
00:58:43,568 --> 00:58:45,331
No, I'm...

469
00:58:45,536 --> 00:58:47,561
Do you have your seal?

470
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:51,208
No, my seal's back at home.

471
00:58:51,409 --> 00:58:53,707
I want to quit the civil service.

472
00:58:54,545 --> 00:58:57,480
I'm in a rush
'cause I found a new job.

473
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:01,548
- Then come to my house.
- Sure.

474
00:59:14,065 --> 00:59:16,659
- Why are you quitting?
- Boredom.

475
00:59:16,868 --> 00:59:20,360
It's killing me. Each day is
as predictable as the last.

476
00:59:20,571 --> 00:59:23,165
Nothing new ever happens.

477
00:59:23,941 --> 00:59:27,399
Still, I put up with it
for a year and a half,

478
00:59:27,612 --> 00:59:31,912
but the only novel thing that happened
was you taking a few days off,

479
00:59:32,850 --> 00:59:36,809
and now this new hat of yours.
That was it.

480
00:59:42,126 --> 00:59:45,425
In any case, don't say anything
when Dad gets back.

481
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:46,927
I've nothing to say.

482
00:59:47,131 --> 00:59:50,828
What I mean is, don't reproach him
about anything.

483
00:59:51,002 --> 00:59:53,766
If you hadn't brought up
his pension...

484
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:58,075
You're so self-centered,
blaming it all on me.

485
00:59:58,276 --> 01:00:00,608
You brought up his savings.

486
01:00:00,812 --> 01:00:03,576
Said even he wouldn't
take them to his grave...

487
01:00:03,781 --> 01:00:09,617
But it just doesn't make sense that
that's all it took to set Dad off.

488
01:00:09,821 --> 01:00:12,085
Dad's never stayed out all night.

489
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:15,851
Let's stop this now.
We don't even know

490
01:00:16,027 --> 01:00:20,396
what he's up to, let alone
if it's got anything to do with us.

491
01:00:27,004 --> 01:00:28,631
I'll be going then.

492
01:00:29,607 --> 01:00:31,666
Oh, c'mon in.

493
01:00:32,944 --> 01:00:34,275
Honey!

494
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:41,701
Thirty years.

495
01:01:42,246 --> 01:01:46,182
Thirty years in that awful place.
It kills me to think of it.

496
01:01:47,552 --> 01:01:49,213
I'm sorry.

497
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:50,853
No, it's just,

498
01:01:52,657 --> 01:01:55,820
recently,

499
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:58,519
every time I see that award,

500
01:01:59,096 --> 01:02:03,032
it reminds me of
that joke you read us.

501
01:02:04,769 --> 01:02:08,500
No, no, that joke hit the nail
on the head.

502
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:16,305
No matter how hard I try,

503
01:02:19,584 --> 01:02:23,350
I can't remember a thing
I've done in that office

504
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:28,559
over the last thirty years.

505
01:02:30,494 --> 01:02:33,122
All I remember,

506
01:02:33,364 --> 01:02:37,698
what I mean is,
I was just busy,

507
01:02:38,469 --> 01:02:42,405
and even then I was bored.

508
01:02:42,974 --> 01:02:48,469
I had you all wrong, Section Chief.
You actually get it. What a shock.

509
01:02:58,289 --> 01:03:02,225
That's crazy. Whatever uncle says,
I know Dad best.

510
01:03:02,426 --> 01:03:03,426
But...

511
01:03:03,461 --> 01:03:08,398
I can't even imagine Dad
with such a young girl.

512
01:03:17,742 --> 01:03:20,905
This is the wrong form.

513
01:03:52,977 --> 01:03:55,673
Are you going in to the office?

514
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:58,007
Yes, I've got to deliver this.

515
01:03:58,382 --> 01:04:01,408
Then will you post my sick leave?

516
01:04:02,787 --> 01:04:05,278
Why are you staying out
of the office?

517
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:10,151
It's a hot topic around there.
Like you mutated or something.

518
01:04:10,995 --> 01:04:12,292
I just...

519
01:04:15,533 --> 01:04:17,831
Are you really sick?

520
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:21,665
Actually, you look kind of pale.

521
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:25,868
It's just that what I mean...

522
01:04:27,044 --> 01:04:29,035
I didn't think so.

523
01:04:30,181 --> 01:04:34,675
So where do you go
when you pretend you're going to work?

524
01:04:36,954 --> 01:04:38,854
You don't fool me.

525
01:04:41,158 --> 01:04:42,489
But how odd.

526
01:04:42,693 --> 01:04:47,062
Don't you know? Sakai-san came here
yesterday and spilled the beans.

527
01:04:50,267 --> 01:04:51,495
Who cares?

528
01:04:51,702 --> 01:04:56,901
After 30 years with an unblemished record,
you deserve at least six months off.

529
01:05:00,845 --> 01:05:05,407
Besides, I'll cover for you.
I'm not like that Fish Kite.

530
01:05:05,616 --> 01:05:09,177
- Fish kite?
- Yes, he's a human Fish Kite,

531
01:05:09,754 --> 01:05:15,386
that Sakai-san is. His lips are always
moving, but he's just hot air inside.

532
01:05:17,561 --> 01:05:20,553
Besides, he acts like
he's some high flyer.

533
01:05:20,765 --> 01:05:24,201
He makes 200 yen more a month
than I do,

534
01:05:24,402 --> 01:05:27,428
so he looks down on me.

535
01:05:47,258 --> 01:05:48,885
Bye, then.

536
01:05:59,603 --> 01:06:02,128
Say, wait, I'll go with you.

537
01:06:55,860 --> 01:06:57,623
Madam.

538
01:06:59,830 --> 01:07:01,320
Madam.

539
01:07:02,833 --> 01:07:07,167
You're so lucky. I wish I could live
in a house like yours.

540
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:12,403
Our place crams three generations
in two rooms. It's like civil war.

541
01:07:14,345 --> 01:07:17,212
And you have a wonderful son, right?

542
01:07:17,581 --> 01:07:21,017
In any event, where do you buy
ladies' stockings?

543
01:07:21,218 --> 01:07:22,845
- You're buying some?
- Yes.

544
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:26,214
Western clothing stores carry them.

545
01:07:28,058 --> 01:07:33,086
They're for your daughter-in-law, right?
I've heard she's very pretty.

546
01:07:33,998 --> 01:07:36,523
According to our
Mr. Fish Kite's report.

547
01:07:48,546 --> 01:07:51,811
- They look wonderful.
- I'm all dizzy.

548
01:07:52,283 --> 01:07:55,309
- They make you that happy?
- So happy.

549
01:07:55,519 --> 01:08:00,479
To buy them myself, I'd have to live
on sardines for lunch for three months.

550
01:08:01,392 --> 01:08:03,986
But why did you buy them for me?

551
01:08:04,195 --> 01:08:07,790
In a word, your stockings had holes.

552
01:08:08,365 --> 01:08:13,564
But the holes in my stockings
don't bother your legs.

553
01:08:13,771 --> 01:08:16,069
It's just that I...

554
01:08:16,273 --> 01:08:22,143
No, no. I didn't mean that.
I know how kind you are.

555
01:08:22,313 --> 01:08:27,808
But right now, I feel kind of awkward,
so I made that awful remark. I'm sorry.

556
01:08:48,606 --> 01:08:50,699
Want to hear something good?

557
01:08:50,908 --> 01:08:51,966
Something good?

558
01:08:52,209 --> 01:08:56,168
I got so bored I had to give everyone
at work a nickname.

559
01:08:56,347 --> 01:08:57,905
Want to hear them?

560
01:08:58,115 --> 01:08:59,946
Sea Slug.
- Sea Slug?

561
01:09:00,351 --> 01:09:04,287
Can you guess?
Someone who's slippery and evasive.

562
01:09:06,223 --> 01:09:08,418
Ohno-san, the sub-section chief.

563
01:09:08,759 --> 01:09:12,126
Sea Slug... indeed.

564
01:09:12,997 --> 01:09:17,229
Ditch-cover-board,
damp and soggy all year round.

565
01:09:18,769 --> 01:09:21,135
- Would that be Ohbara?
- Bingo!

566
01:09:23,374 --> 01:09:25,433
Next comes Flypaper.

567
01:09:25,643 --> 01:09:28,908
- Flypaper?
- You know, sticks to everything.

568
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:31,675
Get it? Noguchi-san.

569
01:09:35,052 --> 01:09:40,752
Next is Saito-san, the manager.
See if you can guess his nickname.

570
01:09:41,125 --> 01:09:45,084
Saito, huh. Saito would be...

571
01:09:45,963 --> 01:09:49,831
Saito's main feature
is that he's so featureless.

572
01:09:50,534 --> 01:09:53,970
I don't really know...

573
01:09:54,605 --> 01:09:56,038
Daily Special.

574
01:09:56,273 --> 01:09:58,833
- Daily special?
- At the cafeteria.

575
01:10:04,014 --> 01:10:06,073
Then what about Kimura?

576
01:10:06,283 --> 01:10:09,377
Rice noodles,
always timid and trembling.

577
01:10:12,556 --> 01:10:15,821
Say, I had a nickname
for you, too.

578
01:10:17,394 --> 01:10:20,989
But I'm not going to tell,
'cause I had you all wrong.

579
01:10:21,198 --> 01:10:24,964
No, don't worry, just tell me...

580
01:10:25,836 --> 01:10:27,133
Oh, dear.

581
01:10:27,338 --> 01:10:31,206
No, I'd rather you broke it to me.

582
01:10:31,408 --> 01:10:34,002
Okay, then. The Mummy.

583
01:10:37,381 --> 01:10:39,178
I'm sorry.

584
01:10:40,184 --> 01:10:42,982
Oh, no...

585
01:10:44,455 --> 01:10:47,356
In other words, I'm...

586
01:11:02,039 --> 01:11:04,371
I'm going.
Thank you so much.

587
01:11:04,575 --> 01:11:09,205
Do you really have to tender
your resignation today?

588
01:11:10,948 --> 01:11:15,749
If you could make it tomorrow,
why not spend today...

589
01:12:46,109 --> 01:12:47,872
You're not eating anything.

590
01:12:48,111 --> 01:12:49,669
No, it's just...

591
01:12:51,148 --> 01:12:53,116
You look so tired.

592
01:12:53,317 --> 01:12:57,845
But I had a truly
marvelous day today.

593
01:12:58,789 --> 01:13:02,156
But you snored through
the best part of the movie.

594
01:13:04,695 --> 01:13:09,325
It's just that I overdid it
a little last night.

595
01:13:15,072 --> 01:13:16,835
Kimura-san...

596
01:13:31,822 --> 01:13:36,316
I really can't...
This isn't the sort of thing

597
01:13:36,527 --> 01:13:41,464
I can tell just anyone.
It's quite embarrassing, but...

598
01:13:42,099 --> 01:13:46,058
In other words, the reason

599
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:49,837
I worked like a mummy

600
01:13:50,073 --> 01:13:53,941
these last 30 years...

601
01:13:56,013 --> 01:13:57,071
Oh, no,

602
01:13:57,281 --> 01:14:03,277
it's not that I mind you
calling me a mummy.

603
01:14:04,321 --> 01:14:08,052
Because that's exactly right.

604
01:14:09,493 --> 01:14:12,860
In other words, I don't blame you.

605
01:14:14,998 --> 01:14:18,627
It's just that the reason

606
01:14:19,236 --> 01:14:22,296
I made myself into a mummy...

607
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:27,670
In other words, I did it all

608
01:14:28,045 --> 01:14:30,639
for my son's sake.

609
01:14:32,115 --> 01:14:36,779
But as it turned out, my son

610
01:14:36,987 --> 01:14:40,980
doesn't seem to give a whit.

611
01:14:45,128 --> 01:14:48,359
But you can't blame it all
on your son.

612
01:14:49,333 --> 01:14:50,800
Isn't that right?

613
01:14:51,001 --> 01:14:54,698
Not unless he asked you
to make a mummy of yourself.

614
01:15:08,552 --> 01:15:10,713
Parents are all the same.

615
01:15:10,921 --> 01:15:14,015
My mom gives me the same
kind of line sometimes.

616
01:15:14,224 --> 01:15:16,818
"The things I've suffered for you".

617
01:15:17,027 --> 01:15:19,188
And I'm grateful she had me.

618
01:15:19,396 --> 01:15:21,557
But it's not my fault I was born.

619
01:15:26,603 --> 01:15:30,369
What's the matter with you,
bad-mouthing your son to me?

620
01:15:34,444 --> 01:15:36,139
It's just...

621
01:15:40,283 --> 01:15:42,581
You know you still adore him.

622
01:16:23,093 --> 01:16:26,324
No end in sight
for the electricity shortage.

623
01:16:26,563 --> 01:16:28,656
Is that a fact?

624
01:17:10,207 --> 01:17:14,576
They say we haven't had
such a heat wave in 30 years.

625
01:17:18,415 --> 01:17:20,042
I see.

626
01:17:40,871 --> 01:17:44,136
The thing is, there's something

627
01:17:45,075 --> 01:17:47,441
I'd like to tell you.

628
01:17:50,847 --> 01:17:54,044
I know I should have
told you sooner,

629
01:17:54,718 --> 01:17:58,882
but it's not very pleasant business.

630
01:17:59,089 --> 01:18:01,717
Father, let's drop it.

631
01:18:02,192 --> 01:18:06,026
You see, I discussed it
with Uncle today,

632
01:18:06,229 --> 01:18:09,665
and we have to address this
to avoid complications later.

633
01:18:09,866 --> 01:18:13,165
For instance, we have our rights
as your heirs.

634
01:18:13,370 --> 01:18:14,928
To avoid misunderstandings...

635
01:18:15,172 --> 01:18:16,172
- Mitsuo!
- Fact is,

636
01:18:16,306 --> 01:18:19,207
she's fleeced you out of 50,000 yen
in a few days.

637
01:18:19,409 --> 01:18:21,604
Young girls these days...
- What are you...

638
01:18:21,845 --> 01:18:25,713
Father, we respect your right
to freedom of expression.

639
01:18:25,916 --> 01:18:28,384
We accept your degenerate behavior.

640
01:18:28,585 --> 01:18:31,247
But we do have
some basic conditions.

641
01:18:31,454 --> 01:18:35,891
Think of Kazue or, putting her aside,
of her family back home.

642
01:18:36,092 --> 01:18:39,289
How dare you bring
a woman like that home.

643
01:18:39,529 --> 01:18:45,058
And holding hands with her in your room.
I could hardly face the maid.

644
01:19:22,939 --> 01:19:29,071
It's been two weeks now since
our protagonist abandoned his spot.

645
01:19:38,655 --> 01:19:40,145
During that time,

646
01:19:40,357 --> 01:19:45,954
various rumors and speculations
have swirled around our Watanabe-san.

647
01:20:01,311 --> 01:20:05,247
All these rumors
and speculations coincide perfectly

648
01:20:05,415 --> 01:20:10,045
with the notion that our Watanabe-san
is being very foolish indeed.

649
01:20:12,222 --> 01:20:17,125
But Watanabe himself has
never taken his actions so seriously

650
01:20:17,327 --> 01:20:19,522
in his entire life.

651
01:20:21,531 --> 01:20:23,158
This isn't the city office,

652
01:20:23,366 --> 01:20:28,065
where you waste a whole day
on an hour's work. It's more serious.

653
01:20:28,305 --> 01:20:29,704
It's just, I...

654
01:20:29,906 --> 01:20:32,466
Every minute I waste here
costs me money.

655
01:20:32,842 --> 01:20:35,003
Then I'll see you tonight...

656
01:20:35,211 --> 01:20:38,544
I'm exhausted at night.
I'd rather sleep than go out.

657
01:20:41,384 --> 01:20:44,319
Besides, why are you always
taking me out?

658
01:20:44,521 --> 01:20:45,521
It's just...

659
01:20:46,690 --> 01:20:50,387
Let's stop doing this.
It doesn't feel right.

660
01:20:50,593 --> 01:20:54,393
But, then, just one more night, okay?

661
01:20:54,597 --> 01:20:56,997
No, it'll never end.

662
01:20:58,201 --> 01:20:59,896
I'm sorry.

663
01:21:28,031 --> 01:21:30,022
After tonight, no more, okay?

664
01:22:32,796 --> 01:22:35,287
Shall we go for a stroll?

665
01:22:35,498 --> 01:22:36,863
I've had it.

666
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:40,934
Next it'll be a sweet shop,
then a sushi or noodle joint.

667
01:22:42,038 --> 01:22:44,802
What's the point of it all?

668
01:22:45,842 --> 01:22:50,973
I feel badly that you keep treating me,
but I've had it up to here.

669
01:22:51,881 --> 01:22:55,476
Besides, we've both run out
of things to say.

670
01:22:58,721 --> 01:23:00,951
There's that face again.

671
01:23:02,392 --> 01:23:05,486
The truth is,
you give me the creeps.

672
01:23:15,839 --> 01:23:19,468
What's going on?
Why do you chase me around like this?

673
01:23:19,943 --> 01:23:22,776
- In other words...
- In other words, what?

674
01:23:23,146 --> 01:23:29,051
In other words, I really enjoy
spending time with you this way.

675
01:23:29,252 --> 01:23:31,152
Keep your old man's infatuation.

676
01:23:31,354 --> 01:23:35,120
No, it's just that I...

677
01:23:35,358 --> 01:23:39,886
Why can't you spit it out,
instead of always dribbling?

678
01:23:44,567 --> 01:23:46,501
- Are you mad?
- No.

679
01:23:54,644 --> 01:23:59,604
I don't even know myself

680
01:24:00,083 --> 01:24:04,281
why I keep following you around.

681
01:24:05,421 --> 01:24:08,618
It's just, all I do know is...

682
01:24:32,182 --> 01:24:36,175
You see, I'm going to die soon.

683
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:39,921
I've got stomach cancer.
It's right here.

684
01:24:44,294 --> 01:24:47,320
Can you understand?

685
01:24:48,431 --> 01:24:53,391
No matter what I do,
I've only got six months or a year left.

686
01:24:54,304 --> 01:24:59,207
Ever since I've known that,
the way I felt about you became like...

687
01:25:00,210 --> 01:25:06,479
I know. I nearly drowned in a pond
once when I was a child.

688
01:25:06,649 --> 01:25:08,913
I felt exactly the same way then.

689
01:25:09,118 --> 01:25:11,552
Everything seems black.

690
01:25:11,754 --> 01:25:17,021
No matter how I struggle and panic,
there's nothing to grab hold of,

691
01:25:17,227 --> 01:25:19,593
except you.
- And your son?

692
01:25:19,796 --> 01:25:22,264
Don't talk to me about my son.

693
01:25:23,266 --> 01:25:25,496
I have no son.

694
01:25:26,936 --> 01:25:29,302
I'm all alone.
- But...

695
01:25:29,539 --> 01:25:32,303
No, you really don't understand.

696
01:25:33,543 --> 01:25:36,910
My son is somewhere far, far away.

697
01:25:38,548 --> 01:25:40,573
Just as my parents were

698
01:25:40,783 --> 01:25:45,083
when I was drowning in that pond.

699
01:25:45,321 --> 01:25:50,884
It hurts me even to think
about him now.

700
01:25:51,361 --> 01:25:54,330
But why is anyone like me so...

701
01:25:54,564 --> 01:25:57,089
It's just that, that, you're, I mean...

702
01:25:57,300 --> 01:26:00,861
When I look at you,
it warms me up

703
01:26:01,037 --> 01:26:03,938
right here.

704
01:26:04,307 --> 01:26:08,141
This old... this old mummy...

705
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:18,880
In other words, you're like,
you seem like my family...

706
01:26:19,055 --> 01:26:25,824
No, that's not right. You're young
and you're healthy, so that's why...

707
01:26:28,631 --> 01:26:32,032
No, that's not right.
In other words,

708
01:26:33,703 --> 01:26:37,469
in other words, why are you so
incredibly alive?

709
01:26:37,674 --> 01:26:39,471
You're just so alive.

710
01:26:39,676 --> 01:26:45,637
That's why I'm envious.
This old mummy envies you.

711
01:26:46,482 --> 01:26:50,179
Before I die, I want to live
just one day like you do.

712
01:26:50,386 --> 01:26:53,378
I'll live that way before I die.

713
01:26:53,623 --> 01:26:57,457
Until I've done it,
I can't just give up and die.

714
01:26:57,660 --> 01:26:59,719
In other words, I just...

715
01:26:59,962 --> 01:27:04,797
I just want something to...
I want to do something.

716
01:27:05,068 --> 01:27:10,836
But it's just that, I don't know what.
But you do know.

717
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:13,338
No, maybe you don't, but you...

718
01:27:13,543 --> 01:27:14,669
But I don't...

719
01:27:14,877 --> 01:27:17,368
No, tell me, how can I be like you?

720
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:21,311
- But all I do is work and eat...
- And what else?

721
01:27:21,551 --> 01:27:23,519
That's all.

722
01:27:30,059 --> 01:27:34,257
I mean it.
All I do is make these little things.

723
01:27:43,906 --> 01:27:46,397
Even making these is so much fun.

724
01:27:46,609 --> 01:27:50,909
Making them, I feel like I'm playing
with every baby in Japan.

725
01:27:52,849 --> 01:27:55,374
Why don't you try
making something too?

726
01:27:56,853 --> 01:27:59,788
What can I possibly make
at that office?

727
01:28:01,290 --> 01:28:07,058
You're right. It's just impossible
to make anything there. So quit and go...

728
01:28:15,338 --> 01:28:17,431
It's too late.

729
01:28:53,543 --> 01:28:55,602
It's not too late.

730
01:28:56,312 --> 01:28:58,837
No, it's not impossible.

731
01:28:59,015 --> 01:29:03,645
I know I can do something there.
I just have to find the will.

732
01:29:11,928 --> 01:29:15,728
There is something I can do...

733
01:29:52,602 --> 01:29:57,938
It's a matter of time before he resigns.
His son came yesterday about his pension.

734
01:29:59,108 --> 01:30:02,009
Which means
you'll finally be section chief.

735
01:30:02,178 --> 01:30:04,408
Well, you never know.

736
01:30:47,423 --> 01:30:49,050
Good morning.

737
01:30:59,902 --> 01:31:00,902
Section Chief.

738
01:31:04,774 --> 01:31:08,005
Ohno, I'd like you to...

739
01:31:10,079 --> 01:31:14,846
PETITION BYTHE WOMEN'S COMMITTEE
TO REPAIRAND FILL IN CESSPOOL

740
01:31:15,051 --> 01:31:18,782
THE ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT IS HEREBY
DESIGNATED IN CHARGE OF THIS MATTER.

741
01:31:19,155 --> 01:31:21,123
But this belongs to Engineering.

742
01:31:21,324 --> 01:31:25,317
No, this is just the sort of matter

743
01:31:25,528 --> 01:31:30,022
that Public Affairs
must take the lead on.

744
01:31:30,333 --> 01:31:32,858
This isn't just Engineering's problem.

745
01:31:33,069 --> 01:31:36,402
Parks and Sewage also
have a responsibility.

746
01:31:39,175 --> 01:31:41,541
- Say, get me a bicycle.
- Yes.

747
01:31:42,111 --> 01:31:45,080
I'm going out to survey the site.

748
01:31:45,881 --> 01:31:48,179
Put together a report today.

749
01:31:48,384 --> 01:31:50,875
I think that's a little impossible.

750
01:31:51,087 --> 01:31:53,647
No, not if you set your mind to it.

751
01:32:17,947 --> 01:32:20,108
Five months later.

752
01:32:20,483 --> 01:32:24,180
The protagonist of our story has died.

753
01:33:09,298 --> 01:33:12,461
Let us see the deputy mayor.
He's here, right?

754
01:33:12,735 --> 01:33:15,727
Five minutes.
Just five minutes, please.

755
01:33:26,882 --> 01:33:29,680
What should I tell them?

756
01:33:55,578 --> 01:33:59,639
- But why press it when nothing's wrong?
- Are you sure?

757
01:33:59,849 --> 01:34:02,647
Our claim is based on
thorough research.

758
01:34:02,852 --> 01:34:04,444
Deputy Mayor, sir.

759
01:34:04,653 --> 01:34:08,919
Although technically the Parks Dept.
and the Ward Committee built that park

760
01:34:09,125 --> 01:34:13,562
with your backing, wasn't it really
Watanabe-san who built it?

761
01:34:13,729 --> 01:34:14,729
That's the word.

762
01:34:14,864 --> 01:34:18,425
But Watanabe was section chief
of Public Affairs.

763
01:34:18,634 --> 01:34:21,762
The Park Department builds parks.

764
01:34:21,971 --> 01:34:24,565
Sure, we understand that.
But actually,

765
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:30,178
we're talking about the man who
kept the plan alive and saw it through.

766
01:34:30,379 --> 01:34:33,940
The community residents believe
that was Watanabe-san.

767
01:34:34,150 --> 01:34:38,849
They're all worried about why
Watanabe-san died in the park he created.

768
01:34:39,054 --> 01:34:40,681
What do you mean?

769
01:34:40,890 --> 01:34:44,849
Well, they had reservations
long before this.

770
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:49,121
You never mentioned Watanabe-san
in the speech you gave

771
01:34:49,331 --> 01:34:52,300
at the park's opening ceremony.

772
01:34:52,501 --> 01:34:54,628
They don't even call it a speech.

773
01:34:54,837 --> 01:34:56,270
What was it, then?

774
01:34:56,438 --> 01:34:58,963
Electioneering.

775
01:35:01,010 --> 01:35:01,976
And also,

776
01:35:01,977 --> 01:35:05,344
that Watanabe-san was snubbed
at the ceremony

777
01:35:05,548 --> 01:35:07,982
and seated in the back row.

778
01:35:08,184 --> 01:35:12,518
In other words, general sympathy
for Watanabe-san

779
01:35:12,721 --> 01:35:17,090
has given rise to a special
interpretation of his death at the park.

780
01:35:18,227 --> 01:35:23,756
Meaning that his was an act of silent
protest against city officials.

781
01:35:23,933 --> 01:35:28,700
So you're saying that Watanabe
committed suicide,

782
01:35:28,904 --> 01:35:33,136
or at least was prepared to,
when he froze to death there?

783
01:35:34,543 --> 01:35:35,908
More or less.

784
01:35:37,079 --> 01:35:42,813
It was snowing last night.
Sounds like a scene right out of a play.

785
01:35:44,753 --> 01:35:45,753
However,

786
01:35:46,755 --> 01:35:52,785
the truth is, an autopsy has clearly
established Watanabe's cause of death.

787
01:35:53,062 --> 01:35:58,500
He neither committed suicide nor froze
to death. He died of stomach cancer.

788
01:35:59,735 --> 01:36:01,794
- Stomach cancer?
- Right.

789
01:36:01,971 --> 01:36:03,871
Intestinal hemorrhaging.

790
01:36:04,073 --> 01:36:08,373
Watanabe died suddenly,
when he himself had no idea.

791
01:36:08,911 --> 01:36:11,812
If you've any doubts...
Ohno,

792
01:36:12,181 --> 01:36:14,706
refer them to his hospital.

793
01:37:28,991 --> 01:37:30,822
It doesn't sit right.

794
01:37:32,494 --> 01:37:36,225
These newspapermen
and their lack of sensitivity.

795
01:37:36,398 --> 01:37:41,233
Actually, it applies
to the general public.

796
01:37:41,937 --> 01:37:47,034
Their fundamental antipathy towards
city officials will never do.

797
01:37:51,380 --> 01:37:54,508
They just don't understand
how we function.

798
01:37:54,850 --> 01:37:58,581
Take that little park in Kuroe,
for instance.

799
01:37:58,754 --> 01:38:03,487
Apparently the public seems to believe
that Watanabe built it.

800
01:38:03,692 --> 01:38:05,956
But that's ridiculous.

801
01:38:06,628 --> 01:38:08,653
I hate to say this at his wake.

802
01:38:10,299 --> 01:38:16,397
And maybe I shouldn't,
in front of his family and relatives,

803
01:38:17,573 --> 01:38:22,374
but I'll go ahead because I know
Watanabe himself would disagree.

804
01:38:23,912 --> 01:38:28,508
Watanabe certainly went
to great pains

805
01:38:28,717 --> 01:38:31,880
to make that park.

806
01:38:32,087 --> 01:38:35,716
I take my hat off to his passion.

807
01:38:36,425 --> 01:38:40,521
But all his efforts were
in the context of his office.

808
01:38:44,533 --> 01:38:47,627
The idea that he went beyond
the scope of his office

809
01:38:47,803 --> 01:38:50,431
to facilitate citizens' desires,

810
01:38:50,672 --> 01:38:53,641
and actually made the park himself,

811
01:38:53,809 --> 01:38:56,972
is nonsensical to those
who understand our bureaucracy.

812
01:39:00,149 --> 01:39:03,550
I'm sure Watanabe himself is wincing.

813
01:39:09,425 --> 01:39:11,017
However,

814
01:39:12,361 --> 01:39:18,231
given that such rumors are surfacing,
perhaps we may have been remiss.

815
01:39:18,834 --> 01:39:23,737
Everyone focused on that historic
project that rushed through construction.

816
01:39:23,939 --> 01:39:27,670
Maybe we should have singled out
someone's service.

817
01:39:27,843 --> 01:39:29,242
For instance,

818
01:39:29,945 --> 01:39:32,140
section chief
of the Parks Department.

819
01:39:33,048 --> 01:39:37,917
Or his superior,
the division chief in Engineering.

820
01:39:40,389 --> 01:39:46,055
That's what you say, Deputy Mayor,
but here's what I think.

821
01:39:46,261 --> 01:39:52,166
All the Parks' section chief and I did
was follow the dictates of our office.

822
01:39:52,401 --> 01:39:56,132
But when you bear in mind
your own struggles

823
01:39:56,338 --> 01:40:00,934
to rein in that notoriously political
City Council,

824
01:40:01,143 --> 01:40:03,737
and realize the park's construction,

825
01:40:03,946 --> 01:40:07,712
it's you, Deputy Mayor,
who should be singled out.

826
01:40:09,151 --> 01:40:10,618
None of that, now.

827
01:40:11,987 --> 01:40:16,617
Some people have even criticized
my speech at the opening ceremony.

828
01:40:17,292 --> 01:40:18,657
Isn't that right, Ohno?

829
01:40:18,861 --> 01:40:23,195
Some even say
I was electioneering.

830
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:28,868
Excuse me.
The residents of Kuroe

831
01:40:29,104 --> 01:40:32,767
are here asking to burn incense
for the deceased.

832
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:41,433
Dear.
Mitsuo-san.

833
01:44:45,994 --> 01:44:48,087
It sure is cold.

834
01:44:48,663 --> 01:44:50,597
May I pour one for you?

835
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:54,461
Oh, no, I'll go get warm sake.

836
01:44:55,003 --> 01:45:00,270
What do you say?
Why don't you all move closer down here?

837
01:45:00,709 --> 01:45:01,971
Why not?

838
01:45:03,745 --> 01:45:05,645
- Over here, please.
- Thanks.

839
01:45:06,348 --> 01:45:08,578
Hayashi-san.

840
01:45:24,366 --> 01:45:25,663
Here, Ohno-san.

841
01:45:28,370 --> 01:45:31,203
Have all the big shots gone
to a meeting?

842
01:45:31,540 --> 01:45:32,540
Yes.

843
01:45:33,842 --> 01:45:36,936
No, they couldn't stand to stay here.

844
01:45:38,980 --> 01:45:43,940
I don't care what anyone says.
It was Watanabe-san who made that park.

845
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:48,387
In their hearts, the deputy mayor
and his people know...

846
01:45:49,024 --> 01:45:52,551
That's going too far.
As the deputy mayor said...

847
01:45:52,761 --> 01:45:57,095
That's right. I'm not saying this
because I'm in the Parks Department,

848
01:45:57,332 --> 01:46:00,893
but we planned, budgeted
and built that park.

849
01:46:01,670 --> 01:46:05,106
No, that's not what I mean.

850
01:46:05,674 --> 01:46:08,643
Let it go. I can understand
your feelings, but...

851
01:46:08,810 --> 01:46:11,779
The point is,
he was in Public Affairs.

852
01:46:12,013 --> 01:46:15,744
How dare he even think about
making a park.

853
01:46:15,951 --> 01:46:18,010
Violating our bureaucratic turf.

854
01:46:18,220 --> 01:46:23,715
No, if you've got to credit something,
it was coincidence that made that park.

855
01:46:23,925 --> 01:46:26,120
- But in that...
- Just listen.

856
01:46:26,361 --> 01:46:31,060
City council members had
an upcoming election to consider,

857
01:46:31,633 --> 01:46:35,933
and the concession owners sniffed
a possible restaurant row,

858
01:46:36,137 --> 01:46:40,403
and all that sure sped up work
on that landfill site.

859
01:46:40,742 --> 01:46:42,039
- That's right.
- Yes.

860
01:46:42,244 --> 01:46:44,235
That's exactly right.

861
01:46:45,747 --> 01:46:48,580
But I just can't figure it out.

862
01:46:49,584 --> 01:46:56,615
Why would anyone with his personality
suddenly up and change like that?

863
01:47:04,666 --> 01:47:06,725
Right, it's a total mystery.

864
01:47:06,935 --> 01:47:08,903
That's right, exactly.

865
01:47:09,104 --> 01:47:14,098
In other words, with the benefit
of hindsight, it's obvious.

866
01:47:14,509 --> 01:47:19,378
Watanabe-san must've known
he had stomach cancer.

867
01:47:19,548 --> 01:47:20,447
That's why...

868
01:47:20,448 --> 01:47:22,916
Oh, we were just discussing

869
01:47:23,118 --> 01:47:26,781
whether or not your father knew
he had stomach cancer.

870
01:47:27,155 --> 01:47:30,522
Well, if he'd known, I'm sure
he would have told me.

871
01:47:30,759 --> 01:47:31,759
I see.

872
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:37,460
But I believe my father was fortunate
to die without realizing he had cancer.

873
01:47:37,666 --> 01:47:40,328
Because that disease
is a death sentence.

874
01:47:40,535 --> 01:47:44,733
I see. Well, that knocks out
Saito's theory.

875
01:47:44,973 --> 01:47:46,531
What's that theory?

876
01:47:47,042 --> 01:47:51,206
It's just that five months ago,
something transformed him.

877
01:47:51,446 --> 01:47:52,538
You're right.

878
01:47:52,781 --> 01:47:57,081
And none of us could make
heads or tails of what had changed him.

879
01:47:57,319 --> 01:48:00,311
Well, that's the woman's touch.

880
01:48:00,522 --> 01:48:02,183
A young mistress' hormones

881
01:48:02,390 --> 01:48:08,124
can temporarily revive
an old man. Happens all the time.

882
01:48:08,496 --> 01:48:11,829
Put a real sheen back on his cheeks.

883
01:48:12,033 --> 01:48:16,993
The truth is, he'd recently
found a way to buff that sheen.

884
01:48:18,173 --> 01:48:20,641
Right.
That explains that rakish hat.

885
01:48:20,842 --> 01:48:25,438
You're right. Frankly, that hat
was quite a shocker.

886
01:48:28,683 --> 01:48:31,652
Section Chief,
I think that's a little impossible.

887
01:48:31,853 --> 01:48:34,549
No, not if we set our minds to it.

888
01:48:45,367 --> 01:48:46,857
But...

889
01:49:21,936 --> 01:49:23,870
My point is,

890
01:49:24,072 --> 01:49:28,270
there was something extraordinary
about his dedication.

891
01:49:28,476 --> 01:49:29,636
Yes, that's right.

892
01:49:31,946 --> 01:49:37,885
I don't mean to argue, but a woman's
touch alone can't account for...

893
01:49:38,086 --> 01:49:39,519
- But...
- Dear.

894
01:49:39,688 --> 01:49:41,986
The thing is...

895
01:49:44,893 --> 01:49:46,861
Just doesn't...

896
01:49:50,999 --> 01:49:54,298
Not to change the subject,

897
01:49:54,502 --> 01:49:59,906
but there were times when his dogged
dedication threatened to derail it all.

898
01:50:00,408 --> 01:50:03,707
That's city hall for you.
Gotta guard your turf.

899
01:50:03,912 --> 01:50:07,609
What I just can't wrap
my head around

900
01:50:07,849 --> 01:50:11,182
is why a 30-year veteran
of the place suddenly...

901
01:50:11,386 --> 01:50:13,411
That's because Watanabe-san...

902
01:50:19,728 --> 01:50:21,161
In any event,

903
01:50:21,329 --> 01:50:25,095
hawking that park proposal of his
around every section

904
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:28,861
practically guaranteed
everyone would dig in their heels.

905
01:50:29,070 --> 01:50:34,872
Including our own section chief.
Parks were our business, not Watanabe's.

906
01:50:36,544 --> 01:50:39,570
We have our own proposals
for new parks.

907
01:50:39,781 --> 01:50:45,378
Can't you reconsider?
This site is really terrible.

908
01:50:45,587 --> 01:50:48,647
But making a park isn't as simple

909
01:50:48,890 --> 01:50:51,757
as you outline in your proposal.

910
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:54,451
No, this proposal is just a...

911
01:50:54,662 --> 01:50:56,186
I understand.

912
01:50:56,664 --> 01:51:01,294
I'll take my time
and go over it thoroughly.

913
01:51:05,607 --> 01:51:08,940
But the thing is, ultimately,
the parks' section chief

914
01:51:09,144 --> 01:51:12,409
caved in to his peculiar determination.

915
01:51:12,614 --> 01:51:16,641
You've got a point there.
Our section chief gave in, too.

916
01:52:21,716 --> 01:52:23,809
He was something.

917
01:52:24,018 --> 01:52:27,215
Watanabe waited days
for the answer he wanted.

918
01:52:27,422 --> 01:52:32,086
Our section chief used to
sneak around, trying to avoid him.

919
01:52:32,327 --> 01:52:33,327
That's right.

920
01:52:44,772 --> 01:52:48,503
Engineering Section Chief,
Section Chief.

921
01:52:51,112 --> 01:52:56,982
Couldn't believe he stooped
to flattering peons like me.

922
01:52:57,418 --> 01:52:59,648
Won't you please...

923
01:53:02,423 --> 01:53:04,084
Isn't there a way...

924
01:53:28,082 --> 01:53:29,743
Finally, we took pity on him.

925
01:53:31,352 --> 01:53:35,186
That's right. In the end
we all took pity on him.

926
01:53:35,356 --> 01:53:38,985
But, hey, you guys in Administration,

927
01:53:39,594 --> 01:53:42,085
you were the worst of all.

928
01:53:42,330 --> 01:53:43,330
That's not...

929
01:53:43,364 --> 01:53:46,856
No, I always went with him,
so I know.

930
01:53:47,035 --> 01:53:50,732
You made us beg for two weeks.
How could I forget?

931
01:53:50,939 --> 01:53:52,463
I'm sorry.

932
01:53:53,708 --> 01:53:58,145
But then, remember that shocker?

933
01:54:01,182 --> 01:54:03,446
Yeah, what a shocker.

934
01:54:38,286 --> 01:54:40,846
DEPUTY MAYOR'S OFFICE

935
01:54:49,163 --> 01:54:52,155
But you know
what was even more shocking?

936
01:54:52,367 --> 01:54:54,198
The thing with the deputy mayor?

937
01:54:54,836 --> 01:54:57,327
I heard, I heard.
What a shock.

938
01:55:00,975 --> 01:55:04,877
A lowly section chief
openly defying the deputy mayor.

939
01:55:05,079 --> 01:55:06,979
Made history at City Hall.

940
01:55:16,324 --> 01:55:19,725
About that new park.

941
01:55:20,461 --> 01:55:22,759
It's one thing to show initiative,

942
01:55:22,997 --> 01:55:27,730
but you don't want people to think
of you as self-aggrandizing.

943
01:55:28,202 --> 01:55:32,002
And the City Council's got
problems of its own.

944
01:55:32,573 --> 01:55:37,101
I think it's best you give up
that proposal.

945
01:55:38,046 --> 01:55:41,675
Last night, we were treated
to a geisha party.

946
01:55:41,883 --> 01:55:45,182
Man, geisha these days
are appalling.

947
01:55:45,386 --> 01:55:49,652
One of 'em spent the whole evening
sulking and clammed up.

948
01:55:49,824 --> 01:55:54,022
The madam said she was
a student, a moonlighter.

949
01:55:55,596 --> 01:55:56,893
That's a laugh.

950
01:56:02,970 --> 01:56:06,064
Won't you please...

951
01:56:08,242 --> 01:56:09,903
reconsider this proposal...

952
01:56:15,616 --> 01:56:18,744
What did you just say?

953
01:56:20,588 --> 01:56:21,588
Yes.

954
01:56:25,560 --> 01:56:26,891
Um...

955
01:56:28,262 --> 01:56:32,255
About that park,

956
01:56:33,968 --> 01:56:37,301
won't you reconsider your decision?

957
01:57:20,681 --> 01:57:22,672
But the thing is,

958
01:57:22,917 --> 01:57:27,411
when you think back, was it worth
his taking it that far?

959
01:57:27,622 --> 01:57:29,920
He was crazy.

960
01:57:30,124 --> 01:57:34,288
It's just that in City Hall
everyone's guarding his own turf.

961
01:57:35,062 --> 01:57:39,328
But after that, the deputy mayor
did reconsider. So...

962
01:57:39,534 --> 01:57:43,493
No, because the City Council rode him.
Coincidence, in other words.

963
01:57:43,704 --> 01:57:49,301
It's too sentimental to attribute it all
to Watanabe-san's dedication.

964
01:57:50,278 --> 01:57:51,278
Sentimental...

965
01:57:51,979 --> 01:57:55,642
Is that so?
I don't see it that way.

966
01:57:56,050 --> 01:58:01,249
The point is, the world is a dark place
if his dedication was pointless.

967
01:58:01,522 --> 01:58:03,149
It is a dark place.

968
01:58:06,194 --> 01:58:07,627
First of all,

969
01:58:07,828 --> 01:58:11,992
just the sight of Watanabe-san.
It was like

970
01:58:12,200 --> 01:58:15,192
he kept himself going
with nothing but work.

971
01:58:15,403 --> 01:58:18,031
Wasn't that how it seemed?

972
01:58:18,706 --> 01:58:22,267
Sometimes he even
gave me the chills.

973
01:58:24,111 --> 01:58:27,478
When was that? I was...

974
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:17,891
It reminds me of seeing him
at that construction site.

975
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:58,897
How can I put it?
The way he gazed out over the site,

976
02:00:59,133 --> 02:01:03,900
like a father or grandfather
tenderly watching a favorite child...

977
02:01:04,138 --> 02:01:06,038
Of course it was.

978
02:01:06,240 --> 02:01:08,765
Because Watanabe-san
cherished that park.

979
02:01:08,943 --> 02:01:11,138
So, in that case...

980
02:01:12,680 --> 02:01:18,846
It's exactly what I told you before.
Whatever anyone may say,

981
02:01:19,053 --> 02:01:20,452
Watanabe-san built it...

982
02:01:20,621 --> 02:01:26,150
But if the City Council and deputy
mayor hadn't been facing an election,

983
02:01:26,360 --> 02:01:28,658
they'd have ditched the proposal.

984
02:01:28,863 --> 02:01:33,163
Watanabe-san had nothing to do
with the crucial decisions.

985
02:01:33,367 --> 02:01:35,801
No, that's not actually true.

986
02:01:35,970 --> 02:01:37,267
- Oh, really?
- Really.

987
02:01:37,505 --> 02:01:40,599
The folks who wanted
that restaurant row

988
02:01:40,841 --> 02:01:44,902
hated having Watanabe
in their way. The thing is...

989
02:02:02,062 --> 02:02:03,427
Section Chief.

990
02:02:04,932 --> 02:02:08,891
- Hey, you Section Chief of Public Affairs?
- Yes.

991
02:02:14,108 --> 02:02:16,372
Just the man I wanted to see.

992
02:02:18,579 --> 02:02:22,071
Old man, you keep your fat trap shut.

993
02:02:22,450 --> 02:02:25,613
What on earth are you trying to...

994
02:02:25,820 --> 02:02:27,549
Don't fuck with me.

995
02:02:32,092 --> 02:02:36,620
No hard feelings.
Just shut up and back down.

996
02:02:37,798 --> 02:02:40,426
Hey, say something.

997
02:02:41,669 --> 02:02:43,136
You're risking your life.

998
02:03:03,257 --> 02:03:05,782
This is him, Watanabe.

999
02:04:23,837 --> 02:04:25,828
I just don't get it.

1000
02:04:26,674 --> 02:04:30,633
Why would anyone like him just...

1001
02:04:30,911 --> 02:04:33,277
I just don't...

1002
02:04:44,725 --> 02:04:49,025
No. Watanabe-san knew
he had stomach cancer. I'm positive.

1003
02:04:49,229 --> 02:04:50,560
But...

1004
02:04:51,999 --> 02:04:56,163
I just suddenly remembered...

1005
02:05:10,384 --> 02:05:12,716
This is just inexcusable.

1006
02:05:12,920 --> 02:05:14,979
We've been at this for two weeks.

1007
02:05:15,155 --> 02:05:19,854
At least they could tell us
whether or not the funds are there.

1008
02:05:20,060 --> 02:05:21,925
Administration's just cruel.

1009
02:05:22,129 --> 02:05:26,225
They'll allocate the funds anyway.
It's not their personal money.

1010
02:05:26,500 --> 02:05:28,365
Now, now, there.

1011
02:05:28,569 --> 02:05:33,336
But doesn't it make you furious
when they walk all over you this way?

1012
02:05:35,476 --> 02:05:36,476
No.

1013
02:05:37,478 --> 02:05:40,606
I can't afford to hate people.

1014
02:05:42,783 --> 02:05:45,911
I haven't got that kind of time.

1015
02:06:02,603 --> 02:06:03,469
Meaning...

1016
02:06:03,470 --> 02:06:07,566
Say. Speaking of that...

1017
02:06:07,841 --> 02:06:13,245
I've got another one like that.

1018
02:06:28,796 --> 02:06:31,526
How beautiful.

1019
02:06:39,707 --> 02:06:42,107
How truly beautiful.

1020
02:06:44,678 --> 02:06:50,139
In the last 30 years,
I'd all but forgotten about sunsets.

1021
02:06:57,825 --> 02:07:01,124
But I haven't got time for this now.

1022
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:07,800
Thought so.

1023
02:07:07,801 --> 02:07:08,568
Now I see.

1024
02:07:08,569 --> 02:07:11,766
Knowing he didn't have
long left to live...

1025
02:07:11,939 --> 02:07:15,102
It makes everything clear as day.

1026
02:07:15,275 --> 02:07:16,970
Otherwise, it makes no...

1027
02:07:17,177 --> 02:07:22,809
Well, that explains his extraordinary
passion and his outrageous behavior.

1028
02:07:23,484 --> 02:07:25,247
How else could he have been?

1029
02:07:25,486 --> 02:07:27,647
Absolutely.
We'd have done the same.

1030
02:07:32,726 --> 02:07:35,820
But any one of us
could suddenly drop dead.

1031
02:07:49,409 --> 02:07:50,808
Listen here.

1032
02:07:51,879 --> 02:07:55,610
Hey, Section Chief.

1033
02:07:58,852 --> 02:08:04,757
I mean you, the newly appointed
Public Affairs Section Chief.

1034
02:08:09,129 --> 02:08:12,155
Don't you hear me?

1035
02:08:13,367 --> 02:08:16,803
I haven't been promoted yet.

1036
02:08:24,912 --> 02:08:26,140
Hey!

1037
02:08:27,181 --> 02:08:29,445
Ohno!
- Cut it out.

1038
02:08:29,883 --> 02:08:33,478
What the hell did you just say?

1039
02:08:34,188 --> 02:08:38,124
"We would've done it, too?"

1040
02:08:39,993 --> 02:08:43,895
Don't make me laugh.
- Hey, cut it out.

1041
02:08:44,131 --> 02:08:48,659
You couldn't have done
what Watanabe-san did.

1042
02:08:50,070 --> 02:08:52,766
Make me laugh.

1043
02:08:53,340 --> 02:08:56,138
Say, Ohara-san...

1044
02:08:57,511 --> 02:08:59,911
The thing is...

1045
02:09:02,349 --> 02:09:04,681
I may look like this...

1046
02:09:07,054 --> 02:09:11,252
- I only graduated middle school...
- Watanabe-san...

1047
02:09:11,491 --> 02:09:16,485
So I'll never make section chief
in my life...

1048
02:09:27,507 --> 02:09:31,204
Compared to Watanabe-san,
we've all just...

1049
02:09:33,580 --> 02:09:36,140
We're just worthless scum.

1050
02:09:37,985 --> 02:09:40,681
Hey, you assholes, too...

1051
02:09:40,954 --> 02:09:42,421
Why, that's...

1052
02:09:46,393 --> 02:09:48,623
That's right, we're all scum.

1053
02:09:49,796 --> 02:09:54,426
But some of us were okay
when we started out at City Hall.

1054
02:09:54,868 --> 02:09:59,498
But the longer you stay...
Even I didn't used to be like...

1055
02:10:02,542 --> 02:10:06,205
You're not supposed to do
anything there.

1056
02:10:06,413 --> 02:10:09,712
Doing anything but nothing
is radical.

1057
02:10:09,917 --> 02:10:13,512
We have to act like we're
doing something but do nothing.

1058
02:10:13,687 --> 02:10:16,554
- That's right.
- That's exactly right.

1059
02:10:16,757 --> 02:10:18,782
The thing is,

1060
02:10:18,992 --> 02:10:23,190
in order to clean up a garbage can
somewhere,

1061
02:10:23,430 --> 02:10:27,594
you need a garbage can
full of paperwork.

1062
02:10:27,801 --> 02:10:29,325
That's exactly right.

1063
02:10:31,672 --> 02:10:36,200
That's just an excuse.
We're robbing people of valuable time.

1064
02:10:36,443 --> 02:10:40,243
The public's upset by bribes
and 40,000 cars and so on,

1065
02:10:40,447 --> 02:10:45,407
but those are just farts next to this
invisible, colossal waste of time.

1066
02:10:49,389 --> 02:10:51,220
Now you listen here.

1067
02:10:51,458 --> 02:10:53,949
I worry about these things, too.

1068
02:10:54,161 --> 02:10:58,495
But the thing is, inside that
complex system, it's impossible.

1069
02:10:58,699 --> 02:11:01,668
Besides, there's never time
to think in there.

1070
02:11:01,969 --> 02:11:03,095
Idiots!

1071
02:11:12,479 --> 02:11:15,710
No, but the thing is,

1072
02:11:15,916 --> 02:11:17,349
Ohara-san,

1073
02:11:17,584 --> 02:11:23,079
even within a system
where you can't get a thing done,

1074
02:11:23,523 --> 02:11:26,390
and battling stomach cancer at that,

1075
02:11:26,593 --> 02:11:30,393
Watanabe-san managed
to accomplish so much.

1076
02:11:32,032 --> 02:11:35,126
That's it.
That's what I'm trying to say.

1077
02:11:35,369 --> 02:11:38,031
That's why I get so angry.

1078
02:11:38,238 --> 02:11:39,432
That's what I'm saying.

1079
02:11:39,639 --> 02:11:43,370
That Watanabe-san,
with no expectations...

1080
02:11:43,577 --> 02:11:49,345
Exactly. When you remember
how Watanabe-san staked his life...

1081
02:11:49,516 --> 02:11:51,780
Who dares claim his achievements!

1082
02:11:51,985 --> 02:11:54,146
The deputy mayor.
Spit it out!

1083
02:11:58,325 --> 02:12:01,123
That's going too far.

1084
02:12:09,669 --> 02:12:11,034
Listen.

1085
02:12:11,538 --> 02:12:16,737
How do you think he felt

1086
02:12:18,278 --> 02:12:21,076
dying all alone in that park?

1087
02:12:21,815 --> 02:12:24,375
Just thinking about it...

1088
02:12:46,606 --> 02:12:51,373
A policeman brought this.
He said he'd found it in the park.

1089
02:12:58,452 --> 02:13:01,979
And he really wants
to light incense for the deceased.

1090
02:13:20,740 --> 02:13:24,107
Thank you for taking the trouble.
Come in.

1091
02:14:22,602 --> 02:14:25,400
You don't have to go.

1092
02:14:25,672 --> 02:14:27,970
Thank you for your trouble.

1093
02:14:29,609 --> 02:14:33,705
Let me pour you one.

1094
02:14:58,538 --> 02:15:00,301
Actually, I...

1095
02:15:05,712 --> 02:15:08,647
Last night, I was

1096
02:15:09,549 --> 02:15:14,418
on patrol in the new park

1097
02:15:16,723 --> 02:15:20,489
when I met him.

1098
02:15:22,095 --> 02:15:24,563
It was 10:00 o'clock... no.

1099
02:15:27,400 --> 02:15:29,425
Nearly 11:00.

1100
02:15:29,869 --> 02:15:32,064
He was on the swing,

1101
02:15:32,272 --> 02:15:37,574
and what with all that snow,

1102
02:15:37,777 --> 02:15:40,405
I just assumed
he was some drunk.

1103
02:15:41,214 --> 02:15:45,913
No, it was a dereliction of my duty.

1104
02:15:51,925 --> 02:15:57,022
If only I'd taken him in,
like I first intended,

1105
02:15:57,764 --> 02:16:00,597
he'd never have ended up...

1106
02:16:01,901 --> 02:16:04,893
How can I apologize to you?

1107
02:16:07,907 --> 02:16:14,142
But he seemed to be
so perfectly happy.

1108
02:16:14,381 --> 02:16:16,008
How can I explain?

1109
02:16:17,651 --> 02:16:21,747
He poured his whole heart
into that song of his.

1110
02:16:24,658 --> 02:16:29,152
His haunting voice...

1111
02:16:31,931 --> 02:16:33,398
pierced...

1112
02:16:35,302 --> 02:16:39,398
the very depths of my own soul.

1113
02:16:44,010 --> 02:16:52,975
Life is brief

1114
02:16:55,422 --> 02:17:02,260
Fall in love, maidens

1115
02:17:05,699 --> 02:17:15,665
Before the crimson bloom

1116
02:17:17,143 --> 02:17:23,639
Fades from your lips

1117
02:17:27,821 --> 02:17:37,196
Before the tides of passion

1118
02:17:38,932 --> 02:17:45,496
Cool within you

1119
02:17:49,409 --> 02:17:58,841
For those of you

1120
02:18:00,687 --> 02:18:07,251
Who know no tomorrow

1121
02:18:29,582 --> 02:18:32,380
Hey, last night,

1122
02:18:33,319 --> 02:18:37,619
under the stairs, I found an envelope
with my name on it.

1123
02:18:38,091 --> 02:18:40,889
It had Dad's bankbook
and seal inside,

1124
02:18:41,094 --> 02:18:45,827
along with forms for expediting
his retirement bonus.

1125
02:18:45,999 --> 02:18:48,763
So he left it before
he went to the park?

1126
02:18:48,968 --> 02:18:52,836
But Dad was so cruel.

1127
02:18:53,006 --> 02:18:56,373
If he had stomach cancer,
why didn't he tell us?

1128
02:18:57,444 --> 02:19:01,881
Hey, his girl never showed up.

1129
02:19:02,081 --> 02:19:04,879
You think that was for real?

1130
02:19:09,622 --> 02:19:10,850
I'll do it.

1131
02:19:11,090 --> 02:19:13,285
I swear.
- Line up behind him.

1132
02:19:13,493 --> 02:19:17,156
We can't waste
Watanabe-san's death.

1133
02:19:18,498 --> 02:19:21,865
I'll work at it
like I'm a man reborn.

1134
02:19:22,335 --> 02:19:25,202
Sacrifice the self to serve the many.

1135
02:19:36,115 --> 02:19:41,143
- Don't forget this feeling.
- I'll do it...

1136
02:19:46,326 --> 02:19:49,318
PUBLIC AFFAIRS
SECTION CHIEF

1137
02:19:57,904 --> 02:19:59,098
Section Chief.

1138
02:19:59,339 --> 02:20:03,435
The sewage main break in Kisaki
is overflowing into Takao.

1139
02:20:03,676 --> 02:20:05,439
Engineering.

1140
02:20:10,717 --> 02:20:15,313
Your complaint is a matter for
Engineering, desk 8.

1141
02:21:30,830 --> 02:21:33,264
Kenbo, Yoko.

1142
02:21:33,566 --> 02:21:35,500
Yoko, Kenbo.

1143
02:21:36,169 --> 02:21:37,830
Suppertime.
