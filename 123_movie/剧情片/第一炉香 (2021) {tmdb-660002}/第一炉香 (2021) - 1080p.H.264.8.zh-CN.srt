00:09:32,974 --> 00:09:35,810
<i>is a beautiful way of telling</i>

167
00:09:35,877 --> 00:09:40,315
<i>the teaching.</i>

168

179
00:10:20,891 --> 00:10:22,091
<i>The tales say he was the son</i>

00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:24,593
<i>of a king, raised in a palace</i>

181

182

<i>But one day, he goes outside,</i>

<i>and he's traveling through the</i>

260

<i>of four encounters.</i>

262
00:14:01,782 --> 00:14:04,717

263
00:14:04,785 --> 00:14:06,553
<i>And he asks his attendant,</i>

264
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,620
<i>and the attendant says,</i>

265
00:14:07,689 --> 00:14:09,790
<i>"Oh, that's change.</i>

266

00:14:17,966 --> 00:14:20,301
<i>he sees a sick man and doesn't</i>

270
00:14:20,368 --> 00:14:23,337
<i>quite understand what it is.</i>

271
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:24,405
<i>He asks his attendant,</i>

272
00:14:24,473 --> 00:14:25,406
<i>and the attendant says,</i>

273
00:14:25,474 --> 00:14:27,541
<i>"Oh, that happens to all of us."</i>

274
00:14:27,609 --> 00:14:28,942

<i>you will not get sick."</i>

277
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,179
<i>Your father will get sick.</i>

278
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:33,114

<i>Everybody will become sick.</i>

280
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,883
<i>>> Then he sees that it isn't</i>

281
00:14:36,951 --> 00:14:38,385
<i>just this sick person;</i>

282
00:14:38,453 --> 00:14:40,221
<i>in fact, it's universal.</i>

283
00:14:40,288 --> 00:14:42,089
<i>And something is stimulated</i>

284
00:14:42,157 --> 00:14:42,923
<i>inside of him.</i>

285
00:14:42,991 --> 00:14:44,125
<i>So he keeps getting the chariot</i>

286
00:14:44,192 --> 00:14:45,692
<i>driver to take him out, and he</i>

287
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,461
<i>sees, you know, horror after</i>

288
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:48,629
<i>horror.</i>

289
00:14:48,696 --> 00:14:49,630
<i>>> And on his third trip</i>

290
00:14:49,697 --> 00:14:54,868
<i>outside, he--he meets a corpse,</i>

291
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:57,805
<i>and he recognizes impermanence</i>

292
00:14:57,873 --> 00:15:00,975
<i>and suffering and death as the</i>

293
00:15:01,043 --> 00:15:02,776
<i>real state of things;</i>

294
00:15:02,844 --> 00:15:04,778
<i>the world that he had been</i>

295
00:15:04,846 --> 00:15:07,080
<i>protected from, shielded from,</i>

296
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,217
<i>kept from seeing.</i>

297
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:11,085
<i>>> And he was shocked.</i>

298
00:15:11,154 --> 00:15:12,354
<i>You know, he was shocked, and</i>

299
00:15:12,422 --> 00:15:15,858
<i>he realized, "this is my fate</i>

300
00:15:15,925 --> 00:15:16,925
<i>too.</i>

301
00:15:16,993 --> 00:15:18,927
<i>I will also become old.</i>

302
00:15:18,995 --> 00:15:20,729
<i>I will also become ill.</i>

303
00:15:20,797 --> 00:15:22,265
<i>I will also die.</i>

304
00:15:22,332 --> 00:15:23,432
<i>How do I deal with these</i>

305
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,634
<i>things?"</i>

306
00:15:24,701 --> 00:15:27,803
<i>These are universal questions</i>

307
00:15:27,871 --> 00:15:30,439
<i>in any human being's life:</i>

308
00:15:30,507 --> 00:15:31,707
<i>what it's like to be in a body</i>

309
00:15:31,775 --> 00:15:33,575
<i>inside of time, and our fate,</i>

310
00:15:33,644 --> 00:15:36,512
<i>and how do we navigate that?</i>

311
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,382
<i>It really is a tale of the</i>

312
00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:41,950
<i>transformation from a certain</i>

313
00:15:42,018 --> 00:15:43,852
<i>naive, innocent relationship</i>

314
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,289
<i>to your own life to wanting</i>

315
00:15:46,356 --> 00:15:48,123
<i>to know the full story, wanting</i>

316
00:15:48,192 --> 00:15:53,162
<i>to know the full truth.</i>

317
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,564
<i>>> And then the fourth trip</i>

318
00:15:54,631 --> 00:15:56,532
<i>outside, he sees a spiritual</i>

319
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:59,135
<i>seeker: someone who has decided</i>

320
00:15:59,204 --> 00:16:01,405
<i>to live a life completely other</i>

321
00:16:01,472 --> 00:16:04,307

<i>and death.</i>

324
00:16:09,646 --> 00:16:10,746

<i>traumatic encounter with the</i>

326
00:16:14,884 --> 00:16:18,287

00:49:21,778 --> 00:49:24,046
natural world in all of its

987
00:49:24,114 --> 00:49:28,784
beauty and fullness,

988
00:49:28,852 --> 00:49:30,786
and he said, "I will not move

989
00:49:30,854 --> 00:49:32,988
from this place until I have

990
00:49:33,056 --> 00:49:38,059
solved my problem."

991
00:49:38,128 --> 00:49:39,595
>> BROWN: "Let my skin and

992
00:49:39,663 --> 00:49:41,964
sinews and bones dry up,

993
00:49:42,031 --> 00:49:43,633
together with all the flesh and

994
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,101
blood of my body," he said.

995
00:49:46,169 --> 00:49:49,272
"I welcome it.

996
00:49:49,339 --> 00:49:50,640
but I will not move from this

997
00:49:50,707 --> 00:49:52,675
spot until I have attained the

998
00:49:52,743 --> 00:49:57,346
supreme and final wisdom."

999
00:49:57,415 --> 00:49:59,849
All at once, Mara, Lord of

1000
00:49:59,917 --> 00:50:03,587
Desire, rose to challenge him.

1001
00:50:11,795 --> 00:50:13,396
With an army of demons,

1002
00:50:13,463 --> 00:50:15,931
he attacked.

1003
00:50:19,203 --> 00:50:21,971
Siddhartha did not move,

1004
00:50:22,039 --> 00:50:23,707
and their weapons turned into

1005
00:50:23,775 --> 00:50:26,209
flowers.

1006
00:50:33,351 --> 00:50:35,251
>> Mara is the ruler of this

1007
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,187
realm of desire, this world

1008
00:50:37,254 --> 00:50:38,788
that we all live in.

1009
00:50:38,856 --> 00:50:41,958
And what he's afraid Siddhartha

1010
00:50:42,028 --> 00:50:43,594
is going to do when he attains

1011
00:50:43,662 --> 00:50:44,896
enlightenment and becomes the

1012
00:50:44,964 --> 00:50:48,133
Buddha is conquer that world.

1013
00:50:48,201 --> 00:50:50,268
That is, he's going to do away

1014
00:50:50,336 --> 00:50:51,369
with desire.

1015
00:50:51,437 --> 00:50:53,071
He's going to--he's going to

1016
00:50:53,139 --> 00:50:55,874
wreck the whole game.

1017
00:50:59,345 --> 00:51:03,681
>> BROWN: Mara did not give up.

1018
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:05,251
He sent his three daughters to

1019
00:51:05,319 --> 00:51:08,253
seduce him.

1020
00:51:16,462 --> 00:51:21,799
Siddhartha remained still.

1021
00:51:21,868 --> 00:51:24,102
>> When he faces Mara, he faces

1022
00:51:24,171 --> 00:51:26,472
himself and his own destructive

1023
00:51:26,539 --> 00:51:29,208
capacity.

1024
00:51:29,276 --> 00:51:30,709
But he's not the warrior

1025
00:51:30,777 --> 00:51:32,845
trying to do battle with those

1026
00:51:32,913 --> 00:51:34,580
qualities.

1027
00:51:34,647 --> 00:51:36,349
He's discovered his own

1028
00:51:36,416 --> 00:51:39,284
capacity for equanimity.

1029
00:51:39,352 --> 00:51:41,686
He has become like, you know,

1030
00:51:41,754 --> 00:51:43,521
the top of the great Himalayan

1031
00:51:43,589 --> 00:51:44,856
mountains, you know:

1032
00:51:44,925 --> 00:51:47,059
the weather is passing over him,

1033
00:51:47,127 --> 00:51:49,295
storms are raging around him,

1034
00:51:49,363 --> 00:51:50,897
and he sits like the top of the

1035
00:51:50,964 --> 00:51:52,999
mountain--impassive--

1036
00:51:53,066 --> 00:51:56,102
not in a trance state, you know,

1037
00:51:56,169 --> 00:52:00,639
totally aware of everything.

1038
00:52:00,707 --> 00:52:05,978
So he frustrates Mara.

1039
00:52:06,047 --> 00:52:07,180
>> BROWN: Siddhartha resisted

1040
00:52:07,248 --> 00:52:09,015
every temptation Mara could

1041
00:52:09,082 --> 00:52:11,350
devise.

1042
00:52:11,418 --> 00:52:13,386
The Lord of Desire had one

1043
00:52:13,453 --> 00:52:15,388
final test.

1044
00:52:19,659 --> 00:52:21,294
He demanded to know who would

1045
00:52:21,361 --> 00:52:22,895
testify that Siddhartha was

1046
00:52:22,963 --> 00:52:24,630
worthy of attaining ultimate

1047
00:52:24,697 --> 00:52:27,266
wisdom, and his demon army

1048
00:52:27,334 --> 00:52:31,270
rose up to support him.

1049
00:52:36,677 --> 00:52:40,212
Siddhartha said nothing.

1050
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,880
he reached down and touched the

1051
00:52:41,949 --> 00:52:46,518
ground, and the earth shuddered.

1052
00:52:54,095 --> 00:52:57,030
Mara's demons fled.

1053
00:53:01,002 --> 00:53:04,037
>> the Buddha reaches down and,

1054
00:53:04,105 --> 00:53:05,738
with his finger, touches the

1055
00:53:05,806 --> 00:53:07,174
Earth.

1056
00:53:07,241 --> 00:53:08,641
he says, "the Earth is

1057
00:53:08,709 --> 00:53:11,377
my witness."

1058
00:53:11,446 --> 00:53:12,779
He said, "Mara, you are not

1059
00:53:12,847 --> 00:53:13,447
the Earth.

1060
00:53:13,514 --> 00:53:15,215
the Earth is right here, beneath

1061
00:53:15,283 --> 00:53:16,283
my finger."

1062
00:53:16,351 --> 00:53:18,585
<i>And the Earth is what we're</i>

1063
00:53:18,652 --> 00:53:20,153
talking about--

1064
00:53:20,221 --> 00:53:21,888
accepting the Earth, not owning

1065
00:53:21,956 --> 00:53:23,390
the Earth, not possessing the

1066
00:53:23,458 --> 00:53:25,692
Earth, but the Earth just as it

1067
00:53:25,759 --> 00:53:30,197
is: abused and exploited and

1068
00:53:30,264 --> 00:53:34,534
despised and rejected and

1069
00:53:34,603 --> 00:53:36,937
plowed and mined and spat on

1070
00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:39,772
and everything else, you know.

1071
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:42,042
It's still the Earth, and it's--

1072
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:44,444
it is--it's--

1073
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:46,446
we owe everything to it.

1074
00:53:54,055 --> 00:53:55,389
>> BROWN: Siddhartha meditated

1075
00:53:55,457 --> 00:54:00,861
throughout the night,

1076
00:54:00,929 --> 00:54:02,696
and all his former lives passed

1077
00:54:02,764 --> 00:54:05,066
before him.

1078
00:54:08,937 --> 00:54:09,802
>> He remembers all his

1079
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:11,138
previous lives, infinite numbers

1080
00:54:11,205 --> 00:54:13,973
of previous lives, female and

1081
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,375
male and every other race and

1082
00:54:15,443 --> 00:54:16,576
every other being in the vast

1083
00:54:16,645 --> 00:54:22,050
ocean of life-forms.

1084
00:54:22,117 --> 00:54:23,151
And he remembered that all

1085
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:23,817
viscerally.

1086
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:25,253
So that means his awareness

1087
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,356
expanded to be--so that all the

1088
00:54:28,424 --> 00:54:29,290
moments of the past were

1089
00:54:29,358 --> 00:54:32,693
completely present to him.

1090
00:54:32,761 --> 00:54:35,396
>> He gains the power to see

1091
00:54:35,464 --> 00:54:38,399
the process of birth, death,

1092
00:54:38,468 --> 00:54:40,569
and rebirth that all creatures

1093
00:54:40,637 --> 00:54:43,405
go through.

1094
00:54:43,473 --> 00:54:45,441
he's given this sort of cosmic

1095
00:54:45,508 --> 00:54:48,978
vision of the workings of the

1096
00:54:49,046 --> 00:54:51,881
entire universe.

1097
00:54:59,523 --> 00:55:00,591
>> BROWN: As the morning star

1098
00:55:00,658 --> 00:55:04,194
appeared, he roared like a lion.

1099
00:55:07,699 --> 00:55:09,132
"My mind," he said,

1100
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,534
"is at peace."

1101
00:55:12,603 --> 00:55:14,436
The heavens shook, and the bodhi

1102
00:55:14,504 --> 00:55:18,741
tree rained down flowers.

1103
00:55:18,809 --> 00:55:20,409
He had become the "Awakened

1104
00:55:20,477 --> 00:55:23,545
One," the Buddha.

1105
00:55:29,721 --> 00:55:31,287
>> Something new opens up for

1106
00:55:31,355 --> 00:55:35,024
him, which he calls "Nirvana"

1107
00:55:35,092 --> 00:55:37,793
or which he calls "awakening."

1108
00:55:42,666 --> 00:55:44,867
>> He said, "at this moment,

1109
00:55:44,936 --> 00:55:46,504
all beings and I awaken

1110
00:55:46,571 --> 00:55:49,072
together."

1111
00:55:49,141 --> 00:55:51,408
So it was not just him.

1112
00:55:51,476 --> 00:55:54,077
It was all the universe.

1113
00:55:54,146 --> 00:55:55,646
He touched the Earth.

1114
00:55:55,713 --> 00:55:58,616
"as Earth is my witness,

1115
00:55:58,683 --> 00:56:00,951
seeing this morning star, all

1116
00:56:01,019 --> 00:56:04,921
things and I awaken together."

1117
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:05,957
>> It's not like entering

1118
00:56:06,025 --> 00:56:06,958
a new state.

1119
00:56:07,026 --> 00:56:08,960
It's uncovering or surrendering

1120
00:56:09,028 --> 00:56:10,394
to the reality that has always

1121
00:56:10,462 --> 00:56:11,995
been there.

1122
00:56:12,063 --> 00:56:13,230
He realized he'd always been in

1123
00:56:13,298 --> 00:56:14,865
Nirvana, that Nirvana was always

1124
00:56:14,932 --> 00:56:16,133
the case.

1125
00:56:16,201 --> 00:56:19,270
Your reality itself is Nirvana.

1126
00:56:19,337 --> 00:56:20,971
It's the unreality, it's your

1127
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:22,273
ignorance that makes you think

1128
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,741
you're this self-centered

1129
00:56:24,809 --> 00:56:26,743
separate being trying to

1130
00:56:26,812 --> 00:56:27,945
fight off an overwhelming

1131
00:56:28,013 --> 00:56:29,881
universe and failing.

1132
00:56:29,948 --> 00:56:31,483
You are that universe.

1133
00:56:31,551 --> 00:56:33,251
>> You're already enlightened.

1134
00:56:33,319 --> 00:56:35,720
He's saying the capacity for

1135
00:56:35,788 --> 00:56:37,055
enlightenment--that your

1136
00:56:37,122 --> 00:56:39,691
awake-ness already exists within you.

1137
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,314
>> Nirvana is this moment seen

1138
00:56:49,382 --> 00:56:51,450
directly.

1139
00:56:51,517 --> 00:56:55,386
There is nowhere else than here.

1140
00:56:55,456 --> 00:56:57,124
The only gate is now.

1141
00:56:57,191 --> 00:56:58,490
The only doorway is your own

1142
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:00,160
body and mind.

1143
00:57:00,228 --> 00:57:01,661
There's nowhere to go.

1144
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:03,431
There's nothing else to be.

1145
00:57:03,498 --> 00:57:05,466
There's no destination.

1146
00:57:05,534 --> 00:57:07,101
It's not something to aim for

1147
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:08,304
in the afterlife.

1148
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:09,670
It's simply the quality of

1149
00:57:09,739 --> 00:57:10,671
this moment.

1150
00:57:10,739 --> 00:57:12,440
>> Just this.

1151
00:57:12,508 --> 00:57:14,576
Just this, this room where

1152
00:57:14,643 --> 00:57:15,443
we are.

1153
00:57:15,511 --> 00:57:17,679
Pay attention to that.

1154
00:57:17,747 --> 00:57:20,149

1165
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:43,542
remained near the Bodhi tree,

1166
00:57:43,610 --> 00:57:48,281
peaceful and serene.

1167
00:57:48,349 --> 00:57:49,782
He was tempted to retire into

1168
00:57:49,851 --> 00:57:52,119
a profound solitude, instead of

1169
00:57:52,187 --> 00:57:54,188
trying to teach others what it

1170
00:57:54,256 --> 00:57:56,290
had taken him six long years to

1171
00:57:56,359 --> 00:57:59,527
discover for himself.

1172
00:57:59,595 --> 00:58:01,196
>> He wants to stay there.

1173
00:58:01,265 --> 00:58:02,564
He's very happy.

1174
00:58:02,632 --> 00:58:04,066
He doesn't want to go out.

1175
00:58:04,135 --> 00:58:07,570
He says to himself, "No one is

1176
00:58:07,638 --> 00:58:09,006
going to understand this.

1177
00:58:09,073 --> 00:58:10,406
You know, people are going to

1178
00:58:10,474 --> 00:58:12,276
think I'm crazy.

1179
00:58:12,343 --> 00:58:13,110
They're going to think I'm

1180
00:58:13,177 --> 00:58:14,945
nuts."

1181
00:58:15,013 --> 00:58:16,780
>> Buddha saw the nature of the

1182
00:58:16,847 --> 00:58:20,250
people: envy and jealousy and

1183
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:22,120
the strong negative mental

1184
00:58:22,188 --> 00:58:23,022
states.

1185
00:58:23,088 --> 00:58:25,756
All the people in the world,

1186
00:58:25,825 --> 00:58:29,694
they are like the fishes

1187
00:58:29,763 --> 00:58:32,065
wriggling in the very shallow

water.

1189
00:58:33,235 --> 00:58:36,337
So Buddha, he himself afraid to

1190
00:58:36,405 --> 00:58:40,308
teach the people.

1191
00:58:47,684 --> 00:58:49,452
>> The myth is that a god

comes to the Buddha.

00:58:51,187 --> 00:58:53,155
Brahma comes on his knees and

1194
00:58:53,223 --> 00:58:56,059
says, "Please, we need you.

1195
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:58,062
Why don't you try talking about

1196
00:58:58,128 --> 00:58:59,228
what you just understood?

1197
00:58:59,297 --> 00:59:01,365
'Cause the world needs--the gods

1198
00:59:01,434 --> 00:59:02,968
need it, and the men need it."

1199
00:59:03,034 --> 00:59:04,602
You know, "the people need it."

1200
00:59:04,671 --> 00:59:06,638
>> And then Buddha decided to

1201
00:59:06,706 --> 00:59:11,776
give his teachings...

1202
00:59:11,845 --> 00:59:14,412
because of a great compassion.

1203
00:59:14,481 --> 00:59:18,584
It's not an ordinary compassion.

1204
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:25,259
>> When you feel the feelings

1205
00:59:25,327 --> 00:59:26,828
of others, you automatically

1206
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,597
don't want them to feel bad.

1207
00:59:28,664 --> 00:59:29,831
You feel the feeling of your

1208
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:30,766
hand; you don't put it

1209
00:59:30,834 --> 00:59:32,568
in the oven.

1210
00:59:32,636 --> 00:59:33,402
I mean, you're not being

1211
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:34,604
compassionate to your hand.

1212
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:35,771
You just feel the pain,

1213
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:36,473
so you're not gonna

1214
00:59:36,541 --> 00:59:37,307
put it there.

1215
00:59:37,374 --> 00:59:38,407
So if you feel other's pain,

1216
00:59:38,476 --> 00:59:39,576
you're going to do your best to

1217
00:59:39,644 --> 00:59:41,043
help them alleviate it.

1218
00:59:41,111 --> 00:59:42,277
>> When somebody becomes

1219
00:59:42,346 --> 00:59:43,714
enlightened, something blooms

1220
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:44,780
in his heart.

1221
00:59:44,849 --> 00:59:46,416
It's like a flower blooms, and

1222
00:59:46,484 --> 00:59:48,418
it cannot hold the fragrance.

1223
00:59:48,487 --> 00:59:50,488
It has to naturally release.

1224
00:59:50,556 --> 00:59:52,089
so it's like he naturally had

1225
00:59:52,157 --> 00:59:53,290
to release his radiance.

1226
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:54,760
He has to share this joy that

1227
00:59:54,827 --> 00:59:58,496
was in his heart.

1228
00:59:58,566 --> 01:00:00,433
>> GERE: 35 years old,

1229
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:01,700
the Buddha would devote the rest

1230
01:00:01,769 --> 01:00:02,903
of his life to bringing his

1231
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:05,371
teachings--the Dharma,

1232
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:06,741
the fundamental laws of

1233
01:00:06,807 --> 01:00:11,544
all things--into the world.

1234
01:00:11,612 --> 01:00:13,613
But as he had feared, it would

1235
01:00:13,682 --> 01:00:17,284
not be easy.

1236
01:00:17,352 --> 01:00:18,819
As he set off to share what he

1237
01:00:18,888 --> 01:00:21,289
had learned, he met a wandering

1238
01:00:21,358 --> 01:00:22,859
ascetic.

1239
01:00:22,927 --> 01:00:24,126
"Who is your guru?"

1240
01:00:24,194 --> 01:00:26,629
the ascetic asked him.

1241
01:00:26,697 --> 01:00:28,731
the Buddha said he had no guru,

1242
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:29,667
that he had attained

1243
01:00:29,733 --> 01:00:32,368
enlightenment on his own.

1244
01:00:32,437 --> 01:00:34,972
"It may be so," the ascetic said

1245
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,908
and walked away.

1246
01:00:37,977 --> 01:00:40,445
On his first attempt to teach,

1247
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:42,546
the Buddha had failed.

1248
01:00:42,615 --> 01:00:45,149
>> Buddha meets someone who

1249
01:00:45,218 --> 01:00:46,518
doesn't see anything special

1250
01:00:46,586 --> 01:00:48,920
about him, because the awakened

1251
01:00:48,989 --> 01:00:50,122
Buddha doesn't look any

1252
01:00:50,191 --> 01:00:51,725
different from anybody else.

1253
01:00:51,793 --> 01:00:54,227
He is ordinary.

1254
01:00:54,295 --> 01:00:55,696
Buddhism is not about being

1255
01:00:55,764 --> 01:00:56,998
special.

1256
01:00:57,066 --> 01:00:58,633

ordinary.

1258
01:00:59,969 --> 01:01:02,536
And it is not about the

1259
01:01:02,606 --> 01:01:06,308
continual exudation of bliss.

1260
01:01:06,375 --> 01:01:09,311
It is about walking a normal

human life with normal human

1262
