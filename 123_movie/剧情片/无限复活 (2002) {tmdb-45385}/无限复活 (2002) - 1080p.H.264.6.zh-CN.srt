215 pounds and can handle himself.

00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,844

is the cab of the gray truck outside.

And at this altitude, I can run flat out for
a half-mile before my hands start shaking.

Now why would I know that?

and not know who I am?

01:46:06,402 --> 01:46:07,903
(MAN SHOUTING)

1109
01:46:36,015 --> 01:46:37,808
(FOOTSTEPS PATTERING)

1110
01:48:47,771 --> 01:48:48,814
It's done.

1111
01:48:49,565 --> 01:48:51,025
Shut it down.

1112
01:49:29,313 --> 01:49:32,399
<i>ABBOTT: The Treadstone project has
actually already been terminated.</i>

1113
01:49:32,483 --> 01:49:35,652
<i>It was designed primarily as a
sort of advanced game program.</i>

1114
01:49:35,736 --> 01:49:38,447
<i>We'd hoped it might build
into a good training platform.</i>

1115
01:49:38,530 --> 01:49:42,076
<i>But quite honestly, for a
strictly theoretical exercise,</i>

1116
01:49:42,159 --> 01:49:44,453
<i>the cost-benefit ratio
was just too high.</i>

1117
01:49:44,536 --> 01:49:46,622
<i>It's all but decommissioned
at this point.</i>

1118
01:49:46,705 --> 01:49:48,290
All right,
what's next?

1119
01:49:48,373 --> 01:49:50,667
<i>Okay, this is</i>

1120
01:49:52,294 --> 01:49:53,504
<i>Blackbriar.</i>

1121
01:49:53,587 --> 01:49:56,757
<i>Blackbriar is a joint DOD
communications program</i>

1122
01:49:56,840 --> 01:49:58,801
<i>that we really feel
has good traction to it.</i>

1123
01:49:58,884 --> 01:50:00,886
<i>It's got legs.
It'll run and run.</i>

1124
01:50:01,512 --> 01:50:05,349
<i>It combines elements of proactive
and reactive fields of security...</i>

1125
01:50:48,934 --> 01:50:50,561
This your store?

1126
01:50:50,686 --> 01:50:51,770
Yeah.

1127
01:50:53,230 --> 01:50:57,276
It's nice. It's a little hard
to find, but...

1128
01:51:01,738 --> 01:51:03,532
Think I could
rent a scooter?

1129
01:51:07,578 --> 01:51:09,079
You have ID?

1130
01:51:10,622 --> 01:51:11,999
Not really.
