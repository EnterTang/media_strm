Here's my toast to you, Captain John Quin.

雷蒙，你怎么在我家里这么没礼貌

145

Mrs. Brady, take the children out.

My dear fellow, are you all right?
亲爱的，你没事吧？

147
00:18:37,252 --> 00:18:41,245
In heaven's name, what does all the row mean?
老天，这是什么意思？

148
00:18:41,356 --> 00:18:42,254
The fact is, sir...
事实上

149
00:18:42,391 --> 00:18:44,723
...the young monkey's in love with Nora.
那小砘锵不杜道

150
00:18:44,793 --> 00:18:47,956
He found her and the Captain in the garden today.
他今天看到她和队长在花园

151
00:18:48,063 --> 00:18:50,531
Now he's for murdering Jack Quin.
现在他要跟杰克昆恩决斗

152
00:18:50,866 --> 00:18:55,200
Mr. Brady, I've been insulted grossly in this house.
布莱迪先生，我在这里被污辱了

153
00:18:55,303 --> 00:18:58,136
I'm not satisfied with these ways of going on.
我不满你们的态度

154
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,074
I'm an Englishman!
And a man of property!

158
00:19:09,718 --> 00:19:13,017

...by calling on Redmond Barry,  Esquire of Barryville.

159
00:19:20,262 --> 00:19:22,355
I'll see the boy home.
我跟那小子说

160
00:19:29,805 --> 00:19:34,071
A pretty day's work, Master Redmond.
好，雷蒙先生

00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:36,504
Knowing your uncle is distressed for money...

你想要捣乱他一年收入1500英镑的收入？

Quin has promised to pay off the L4,000
which is bothering your uncle.
昆恩答应付你叔叔4000英镑的债

He takes a girl without a penny...
他分文不取的接受她

165
00:19:49,758 --> 00:19:53,194
...a girl that's flinging herself
at the head of every man in these parts.
这位到处拈花惹草的女人

166
00:19:53,328 --> 00:19:56,627
And missing them all!
全都不介意！

167
00:19:57,265 --> 00:20:02,430
And you, who ought to be attached
to your uncle as to your father....
你应该如尊敬你父亲一样尊敬你叔叔

168
00:20:02,504 --> 00:20:03,903
I am.

169
00:20:04,005 --> 00:20:06,599
And this is the return
you make for his kindness?

170
00:20:07,042 --> 00:20:10,603
Didn't he harbour you when your father died?

171
00:20:10,712 --> 00:20:14,978
Hasn't he given you and your mother a fine house, rent free?
他不是不收半毛钱，让你和你妈住？

172
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:18,416
Mark this, and come what will of it...
听我说，不管你怎么想

173
00:20:18,487 --> 00:20:22,355
...I will fight the man who pretends
the hand of Nora Brady.
我要跟抢走诺拉的人决斗

174
00:20:22,591 --> 00:20:27,290
I'll follow him if it's into the church and fight him there.
我甚至会跟他到教堂决斗

175
00:20:27,362 --> 00:20:30,354
I'll have his blood, or he'll have mine.
不是他死就我死

176
00:20:34,636 --> 00:20:37,298
Faith, and I believe ye!

177
00:20:37,439 --> 00:20:41,375
I never saw a lad more game in me life.

Give me a kiss, me boy.

You're after me own soul.
你跟我一样

180
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:55,255
As long as I live, you shall never want a friend or a second.
只要我活着，你找不到更好的朋友

181
00:20:55,724 --> 00:21:00,252
Will you take my message to him?
And arrange a meeting?
你答应了吗？会安排决斗？

182
00:21:01,863 --> 00:21:05,890
Well, if it must be, it must.
如果你要的话，就举行吧

183
00:22:12,267 --> 00:22:16,897
Look here, Redmond, me boy,
this is a silly business.
听着，雷蒙，这很笨

184
00:22:17,005 --> 00:22:20,634
The girl will marry Quin, mark my words.
这女孩会嫁给昆恩，相信我

185
00:22:20,842 --> 00:22:24,334
And as sure as she does, you'll forget her.
你很快就会忘记她

186
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:29,473
You're but a boy and Quin is willing to consider you as such.
你是个小孩，昆恩也把你当小孩看

187
00:22:30,118 --> 00:22:32,245
Right, Quin?
是吗，昆恩？

188
00:22:32,921 --> 00:22:35,253
Yes.
是的

189
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,787
Now, Dublin's a fine place.
都柏林是好地方

190
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:45,161
If you've a mind to ride there
and see the town for a month...
如果你可以骑马到那里去逛一个月的话

191
00:22:45,267 --> 00:22:49,203
...here's ten guineas at your service.
这里的钱让你当盘缠

192
00:22:49,838 --> 00:22:52,773
Will that satisfy you, Captain Quin?
昆恩队长，你满意吗？

193
00:22:53,141 --> 00:22:57,077
Yes, if Mr. Barry will apologize and go to Dublin...
是的，如果巴瑞先生道歉，并且前往都柏林

194
00:22:57,178 --> 00:23:00,875
...I will consider the whole affair honourably settled.
我会考虑把这不当一回事

195
00:23:06,988 --> 00:23:10,219
Say you're sorry, Redmond.
雷蒙，说道歉

196
00:23:10,492 --> 00:23:13,620
You can easily say that.
很简单

197
00:23:20,268 --> 00:23:22,793
I'm not sorry.
我不道歉

198
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:26,964
And I'll not apologize.
不要

199
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:33,772
And I'd as soon go to Dublin as to hell.
我宁愿死也不愿去都柏林

200
00:23:40,322 --> 00:23:45,021
Then there's nothing else for it.
我们之间没什么好说的了

201
00:23:45,794 --> 00:23:48,729
God bless you.
上帝保佑你吧

202
00:23:51,966 --> 00:23:54,230
This isn't my pistol.
这不是我的手枪

203
00:23:54,569 --> 00:23:56,799
It's all right, it's one of mine.
别担心，这是我的

204
00:23:57,172 --> 00:24:00,733
Yours will serve, if it's needed, for the next round. 
如果要的话，下一轮我会给你你的手枪

205
00:24:03,211 --> 00:24:05,611
Good luck, Redmond.
祝你好运，雷蒙

206
00:24:17,258 --> 00:24:19,158
Gentlemen...
各位

...cock your pistols.
举起手枪

208

00:24:40,582 --> 00:24:43,142
...aim your pistols.
瞄准目标

210
00:24:56,197 --> 00:24:57,630
One.

Two.
二

212
00:25:03,505 --> 00:25:04,836
Three.

00:25:15,016 --> 00:25:16,677
Is he dead?
他死了吗？

214
00:25:20,622 --> 00:25:22,385
Quite dead.
活不了

00:25:27,829 --> 00:25:31,697
This has been a sad day's work for our family.
我们家悲惨的一天

216
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,963
Ye've robbed us of 1,500 a year.
你剥夺了我们一年1500英镑的收入

217
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:37,560
Now you'd better ride off，before the Police are up.
警察来前，你最好走吧

218
00:25:37,672 --> 00:25:41,073
They'd wind of this before we left Kilwangen.
我们前往克怀根前就会东窗事发

219
00:25:41,476 --> 00:25:44,912
Come on, Redmond, I'll go home with you.
快，雷蒙，我跟你回去

How different Barry's fate might have been...

...had he not fallen in love with Nora...

没有把酒丢在昆恩队长脸上

223
00:26:17,512 --> 00:26:20,413
But he was destined to be a wanderer.

224
00:26:20,515 --> 00:26:23,916
And the battle with Quin set him on his travels at an early age...
与昆恩的决斗迫使他的早年

226
00:26:27,655 --> 00:26:32,251
The boy must go into hiding 
for a short time, anyway.
那小子暂时一定躲起来了

227
00:26:32,527 --> 00:26:34,893
Dublin's the best place for him.
都柏林最适合他躲

228

He can stay there 'til matters have blown over.

But the child has never been away from home before.
那孩子从来没有离开家过

230
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,134
Wouldn't he be as safe here?
他在这里不安全吗？

231
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:47,231
I wish that were true, Aunt Belle.
我希望这里能够安全，贝尔阿姨

232
00:26:47,308 --> 00:26:51,904
But the Bailiffs may be on their way already.
但法警可能已经出发啦

233
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:55,343
Now, Dublin is five days ride away from here.
都柏林离这里有五天的路程

234

There's not a soul who'll know him there.

I don't want to harp on unpleasant matters...

I'll be all right.

238
00:27:22,977 --> 00:27:25,741
I'll be all right in Dublin, Mother.
妈，我在都柏林不会有事

239
00:27:56,644 --> 00:28:01,911
No lad with liberty for the first time,
and 20 guineas in his pocket...
那些头一次体会自由的人，手边还有二十基尼

240
00:28:02,016 --> 00:28:03,745
...is very sad.

241
00:28:03,818 --> 00:28:08,221
Barry rode towards Dublin thinking not so much of. ..
巴瑞前往都柏林，沿路不太思念

242

Excuse me, miss.

Would it be possible to have a drink of water?

Will you join us in a drink?

Would you like something to eat?
要不要吃点东西？

我给你一百基尼

382
00:47:04,391 --> 00:47:08,020
剩下的玩牌都输掉了

383
00:47:10,864 --> 00:47:15,358
小子，亲我吧
我们以后不会再见面了

384
00:47:47,167 --> 00:47:52,730
坐在舒服的摇椅上
想着光荣的战役很简单

385
00:47:52,873 --> 00:47:57,003
但当你亲眼目睹

386
00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:04,343
他朋友死后
巴瑞对于军对荣耀的想法开始改

387
00:48:04,417 --> 00:48:06,044
如何逃离

388
00:48:06,153 --> 00:48:09,088
他还要服役六年的军队

389
00:48:22,702 --> 00:48:26,297
大家都谈论骑士时代

390
00:48:26,373 --> 00:48:31,174
但记得他们带领的
都是强盗土匪

391
00:48:31,545 --> 00:48:36,812
凭着破烂的武器
这些伟大的战士，与国王

392
00:48:36,883 --> 00:48:39,852
赢了战役

393
00:48:49,396 --> 00:48:53,025
巴瑞现在的境遇

394
00:48:53,133 --> 00:48:56,193
应该是最悲惨的

395
00:48:56,303 --> 00:49:00,763
但命运注定
他不需要军旅生涯不会太久

396
00:49:00,874 --> 00:49:02,637
一件令人意想不到的事

397
00:49:02,742 --> 00:49:07,179
让他非常不寻常的离开军队

398
00:49:35,008 --> 00:49:39,672
佛莱迪，希望你别生我的气

399
00:49:39,779 --> 00:49:43,408
但我得说一件
你不会感到开心的事

400
00:49:43,516 --> 00:49:45,814
什么事？

401
00:49:45,986 --> 00:49:50,252
你得先说好
你不会生气

402
00:49:50,357 --> 00:49:55,021
强纳生，别这样！
你先挑起来的

403
00:49:55,161 --> 00:49:57,652
什么事？

404
00:49:58,031 --> 00:50:00,727
我又要离开了

405
00:50:00,834 --> 00:50:03,302
大约二星期

406
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:06,771
你说真的吗？

407
00:50:06,873 --> 00:50:11,367
是的，没办法

408
00:50:11,511 --> 00:50:13,342
这次要上哪去？

409
00:50:13,413 --> 00:50:18,783
到布莱梅，把重要消息
传给亨利王子

410
00:50:18,852 --> 00:50:23,551
但你保证上次
已经是最后一次

411
00:50:23,657 --> 00:50:27,388
我知道，我也想遵守诺言

412
00:50:27,527 --> 00:50:30,860
但庞特斯比
坚持要我去

413
00:50:31,231 --> 00:50:36,669
这是逃离军队
绝佳的机会

414
00:50:37,003 --> 00:50:43,272
会经过几个普鲁士
占领的地方

415
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:46,070
而这位军官的军服和文件

416
00:50:46,179 --> 00:50:49,774
让他经过时不会遭到
任何怀疑

417
00:50:49,883 --> 00:50:54,513
而带着他背叛的消息离开

418
00:50:54,721 --> 00:50:56,814
我们还有一点时间

419
00:50:57,624 --> 00:50:59,888
你生我的气吗？

420
00:51:00,527 --> 00:51:05,294
我不会生你的气太久

421
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,663
强纳生

422
00:51:09,102 --> 00:51:12,833
像这种时候我才发现
你对我来说有多亲密

423
00:51:12,939 --> 00:51:16,272
没有你我的生活
会多空虚

424
00:51:16,376 --> 00:51:17,035
佛德瑞克！

425
00:51:41,668 --> 00:51:48,073
巴瑞看见了普鲁士军团的制服
非常开心

426
00:51:48,174 --> 00:51:53,373
表示他已经离开
英国占领的区域

427
00:51:58,852 --> 00:52:01,480
他本想要前往荷兰

428
00:52:01,554 --> 00:52:05,547
一个欧洲少数几个中立的国家

429
00:52:05,625 --> 00:52:08,492
再从那里
设法回到故乡

430
00:52:09,229 --> 00:52:10,890
当他骑在马上

431
00:52:10,997 --> 00:52:14,626
巴瑞深深感觉到

432
00:52:14,834 --> 00:52:19,362
决心要过个绅士的生活

433
00:52:38,091 --> 00:52:40,321
小姐，对不起

434
00:52:40,593 --> 00:52:42,026
什么事

435
00:52:42,095 --> 00:52:43,790
早安

436
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:45,224
早安

437
00:52:47,033 --> 00:52:49,058
你会说英语吗？

438
00:52:51,204 --> 00:52:53,729
一点点

439
00:52:56,643 --> 00:53:01,603
我整天没有吃东西了

440
00:53:01,781 --> 00:53:06,047
附近有吃的地方吗？

441
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,112
没有

442
00:53:11,124 --> 00:53:16,960
到达葛伦堡前
都没有餐厅

443
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:21,724
你住在附近吗？

444
00:53:24,237 --> 00:53:26,102
是的

445
00:53:28,675 --> 00:53:34,875
你能帮我弄点吃的？
我可以付你钱

446
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:39,581
好的

447
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:06,776
男的还是女的

448
00:54:07,247 --> 00:54:08,407
男的

449
00:54:11,451 --> 00:54:12,748
叫什么名字？

450
00:54:12,852 --> 00:54:14,080
彼得

451
00:54:15,221 --> 00:54:17,121
几岁？

452
00:54:17,824 --> 00:54:20,418
一岁

453
00:54:23,096 --> 00:54:25,860
他父亲呢？

454
00:54:27,333 --> 00:54:30,302
在哪里？

455
00:54:31,204 --> 00:54:32,694
是的

456
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,505
打仗去了

457
00:54:39,946 --> 00:54:42,312
去多久？

458
00:54:44,584 --> 00:54:48,384
我听不懂

459
00:54:48,588 --> 00:54:50,146
什么？

460
00:54:54,127 --> 00:54:56,027
很久

461
00:54:56,362 --> 00:54:59,024
春天就去了

462
00:55:04,237 --> 00:55:06,603
你一个人过生活
一定很辛苦

463
00:55:10,843 --> 00:55:12,777
没错

464
00:55:17,517 --> 00:55:22,113
身处战地一定很危险

465
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:28,992
我是个军官
尽我的本分

466
00:55:38,738 --> 00:55:40,797
你有时候会觉得…

467
00:55:40,907 --> 00:55:42,704
寂寞吗？

468
00:55:44,844 --> 00:55:46,709
有时候会的

469
00:56:03,563 --> 00:56:07,055
你说你叫什么名字？

470
00:56:08,468 --> 00:56:10,868
费肯汉中尉

471
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:13,404
不是，我是说…

472
00:56:13,473 --> 00:56:17,500
你的名字

473
00:56:17,744 --> 00:56:20,941
名字？

474
00:56:21,047 --> 00:56:22,981
强纳生

475
00:56:23,916 --> 00:56:28,944
你愿意跟我

476
00:56:29,055 --> 00:56:31,023
在一起吗？

477
00:56:31,124 --> 00:56:35,424
几天就好？

478
00:56:38,231 --> 00:56:40,825
好

479
00:57:10,563 --> 00:57:14,863
再见，可人儿莉贞

480
00:57:19,739 --> 00:57:23,539
再见，雷蒙

481
00:57:25,578 --> 00:57:26,875
我爱你

482
00:57:26,946 --> 00:57:28,709
我也爱你

483
00:57:29,882 --> 00:57:32,350
保重

484
00:57:36,122 --> 00:57:39,216
愿上帝与你同在

485
00:57:42,428 --> 00:57:47,161
一个将心交给军人的女人

486
00:57:47,266 --> 00:57:50,258
一定要准备
常常更换爱人

487
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:53,237
否则她的生活会很悲伤

488
00:57:54,407 --> 00:57:59,003
莉贞的心就像是邻近的乡村

489
00:57:59,112 --> 00:58:05,540
在巴瑞出现前
遭受到战火多次攻击与复原

490
00:58:29,542 --> 00:58:33,034
在这五年的战争中

491
00:58:33,246 --> 00:58:38,081
费德瑞克的军团
耗尽男性人口

492
00:58:38,151 --> 00:58:40,984
为了雇用特别的人

493
00:58:41,053 --> 00:58:44,682
甚至犯罪绑架也在所不惜

494
00:58:44,824 --> 00:58:49,557
以便维持军团的光辉

495
00:59:21,461 --> 00:59:23,019
长官，晚安

496
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:29,192
我是帕兹朵夫队长
你是谁？

497
00:59:29,869 --> 00:59:34,033
盖尔步兵团
费肯汉中尉

498
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:36,040
你好

499
00:59:37,076 --> 00:59:40,239
有何贵事？

500
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:45,110
我身上携有重要消息
需要通过

501
00:59:45,551 --> 00:59:47,883
你要去哪？

502
00:59:49,021 --> 00:59:51,421
布莱梅

503
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:55,950
中尉，你一定是迷路了

504
00:59:56,095 --> 00:59:58,063
布莱梅在另一个方向

505
00:59:58,197 --> 00:59:59,129
你确定吗？

506
00:59:59,265 --> 01:00:01,165
是的

507
01:00:02,201 --> 01:00:04,260
怎么可能？

508
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:10,707
我的助理没有时间
准备详细的地图给我

509
01:00:10,776 --> 01:00:13,108
我了解

510
01:00:14,614 --> 01:00:18,345
中尉，别在意

511
01:00:18,417 --> 01:00:21,818
你有身分证明文件吗？

512
01:00:23,022 --> 01:00:25,422
当然有

513
01:00:26,125 --> 01:00:28,821
我可以看看吗？

514
01:00:30,763 --> 01:00:33,061
可以

515
01:00:36,769 --> 01:00:39,237
谢谢

516
01:00:52,785 --> 01:00:57,347
中尉，谢谢你
希望没有造成你的不便

517
01:00:57,523 --> 01:00:59,013
不会

518
01:01:00,927 --> 01:01:04,590
既然我们顺路同一个方向

519
01:01:04,797 --> 01:01:09,757
今晚我能提供你食宿的地方

520
01:01:09,869 --> 01:01:12,963
还有一张仔细点的地图？

521
01:01:14,407 --> 01:01:19,845
队长，你人真好
我有幸能够接受款待

522
01:01:41,834 --> 01:01:45,270
他们非常善待巴瑞

523
01:01:45,471 --> 01:01:48,440
他们问他种种英国的问题

524
01:01:48,674 --> 01:01:53,873
他凭着自己想像
尽量好好回答

525
01:01:54,513 --> 01:01:57,346
他描述着国王和首相

526
01:01:57,416 --> 01:02:01,216
吹嘘说柏林的英国大使
是他的叔叔

527
01:02:01,387 --> 01:02:05,255
甚至可以给帕兹多夫
写封推荐信函

528
01:02:05,958 --> 01:02:09,724
招待他的主人
他的回答

529
01:02:09,795 --> 01:02:15,062
但马上技巧的巴结

530
01:02:15,167 --> 01:02:17,032
询问巴瑞

531
01:02:17,136 --> 01:02:21,197
我对英国认识很少

532
01:02:21,273 --> 01:02:24,572
除了说你们是
世界上最勇敢的国家

533
01:02:24,677 --> 01:02:28,443
我们很幸运
有你们这种同盟伙伴

534
01:02:29,248 --> 01:02:31,443
费肯汉中尉

535
01:02:31,751 --> 01:02:35,744
敬我们两国之间的友谊

536
01:02:37,123 --> 01:02:39,421
敬我们两个伟大的国家

537
01:02:59,245 --> 01:03:04,308
你很幸运
明天就你到布莱梅了

538
01:03:04,483 --> 01:03:08,044
一位欧洲最美的女士
住在那儿

539
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:12,017
你能帮我带个口信？

540
01:03:13,292 --> 01:03:14,782
很乐意

541
01:03:14,927 --> 01:03:19,023
对了，你要把口信交给谁？

542
01:03:21,333 --> 01:03:24,097
威廉森将军

543
01:03:25,504 --> 01:03:28,098
威廉森将军？

544
01:03:29,475 --> 01:03:33,468
波斯佛威廉森将军？

545
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:37,008
正是

546
01:03:48,661 --> 01:03:51,357
逮捕这砘

547
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:58,893
逮捕我？帕兹朵夫队长…

548
01:03:59,105 --> 01:04:01,232
我是个英国军官

549
01:04:01,407 --> 01:04:05,207
你是个大骗子

550
01:04:05,311 --> 01:04:07,541
还是个逃兵

551
01:04:08,047 --> 01:04:12,814
我今天早上就怀疑你
你的谎言证实了一切

552
01:04:13,185 --> 01:04:18,282
你说你带口信给
已经死了十个月的将军

553
01:04:18,524 --> 01:04:20,424
你说柏林的英国大使

554
01:04:20,526 --> 01:04:25,463
是你的叔叔
叫做欧葛莱帝这种奇怪的名字

555
01:04:25,765 --> 01:04:30,668
你要加入我们的军队？
还是投降？

556
01:04:34,073 --> 01:04:35,631
我自愿

557
01:04:39,145 --> 01:04:44,139
普鲁士的军队比英国军队还糟糕

558
01:04:44,216 --> 01:04:48,550
士兵的生活充满危险

559
01:04:49,955 --> 01:04:54,949
军官滥用处罚权力

560
01:04:56,729 --> 01:05:01,291
低阶军官常常受到鞭打

561
01:05:01,667 --> 01:05:06,832
更严重的
到伤残或死亡

562
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:17,605
七年战后

563
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:24,918
在普鲁士军官暴政下
军队以风纪闻名

564
01:05:25,024 --> 01:05:27,959
但军队大多是由

565
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:31,223
社会低下阶层

566
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:35,824
或是从欧洲据来的人所组成

567
01:05:36,468 --> 01:05:41,929
最糟的是，巴瑞
落入最烂的军队

568
01:05:42,007 --> 01:05:47,639
各种侮辱都有

569
01:07:36,355 --> 01:07:37,754
救命！

570
01:07:40,893 --> 01:07:42,793
救我出去

571
01:09:05,677 --> 01:09:10,979
上校表示
国王对他很满意

572
01:09:11,050 --> 01:09:14,349
在奥多夫战役中
整个军团的表现

573
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:20,154
以及巴瑞下士英勇拯救
帕兹多夫队长的行为

574
01:09:20,292 --> 01:09:24,661
获得二个腓德烈克金币

575
01:09:29,501 --> 01:09:33,494
巴瑞下士，往前八步

576
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:35,136
前进！

577
01:09:47,453 --> 01:09:48,977
巴瑞下士

578
01:09:53,392 --> 01:09:56,987
你是个勇敢的士兵
顾家的好男人

579
01:09:57,129 --> 01:10:00,223
但你很懒散
没有纪律

580
01:10:00,299 --> 01:10:02,995
影响其他人的士气

581
01:10:03,102 --> 01:10:08,699
除了你的勇气
你一无是处

582
01:10:10,109 --> 01:10:13,704
我希望上校弄错了

583
01:10:13,812 --> 01:10:18,749
我只是加入不好的军队
不是行为不良

584
01:10:18,817 --> 01:10:22,378
我没有朋友或上司

585
01:10:22,488 --> 01:10:25,480
证明我能做得更好
