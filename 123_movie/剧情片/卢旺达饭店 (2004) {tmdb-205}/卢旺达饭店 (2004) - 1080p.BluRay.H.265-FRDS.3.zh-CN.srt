00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,078
由于停火过晚 没能挽救这些村庄…

当人们问我 尊敬的听众朋友们
When people ask me, good listeners,

6
00:00:35,498 --> 00:00:37,597
为什么我讨厌所有的图西族人
why do I hate all the Tutsi,

7
00:00:37,669 --> 00:00:40,536
我说 “去看看我们的历史吧”
I say, "Read our history. "

8
00:00:40,606 --> 00:00:43,541
图西族曾通敌比利时殖民者
The Tutsi were collaborators for the Belgian colonists.

9
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:46,601
他们强占我们胡图族的土地 用鞭子抽我们
They stole our Hutu land, they whipped us.

10
00:00:46,678 --> 00:00:49,772
现在这些图西族反叛分子 他们回来了
Now they have come back, these Tutsi rebels.

11
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:53,113
他们如同蟑螂 他们是杀人犯
They are cockroaches. They are murderers.

12
00:00:53,185 --> 00:00:57,781
卢旺达是我们胡图族的领地 我们才是主人
Rwanda is our Hutu land. We are the majority.

13
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:01,383
他们则是少数叛国者和侵略者
They are a minority of traitors and invaders.

14
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:07,296
我们要粉碎他们的横行 消灭RPF反叛分子

那是支上等的雪茄 先生
That is a fine cigar, sir,

26
00:02:25,777 --> 00:02:27,506
这是Cohiba牌的雪茄（注：Cohiba是世界顶级雪茄烟品牌）
This is a Cohiba cigar,

27
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:31,515
- 每一支值10,000法郎 - 10,000法郎？
- Each one is worth 10,000 francs, - 10,000 francs?

28
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:34,882
是的 不错 但对我来说比10,000法郎还值钱
Yes, yes, But it is worth more to me than 10,000 francs,

29
00:02:34,953 --> 00:02:36,580
怎么讲 先生？
What do you mean, sir?

30
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:43,387
要是给一个商人10,000法郎 这对他来说意味着什么？
If I give a businessman 10,000 francs, what does that matter to him?

31
00:02:43,462 --> 00:02:47,398
他不缺钱的 但是…如果我给他一支Cohiba牌的雪茄
He is rich, But if I give him a Cohiba cigar

32
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:52,165
直接从古巴首都哈瓦那带回来的…嘿 这就体面了 杜比
straight from Havana, Cuba,,, Hey, that is style, Dube,

33
00:02:52,938 --> 00:02:54,030

34
00:03:03,982 --> 00:03:06,974
Cohiba――不可思议的雪茄
Cohiba--a fantastic cigar,

35
00:03:07,886 --> 00:03:09,183
是最好的 对吧？
The best, eh?

36
00:03:09,254 --> 00:03:11,916

我会尽力而为 乔治
I will try my best, George,

38
00:03:15,894 --> 00:03:19,489
这些日子我没时间参加集会和政治活动
but these days I have no time for rallies and politics,

39
00:03:19,565 --> 00:03:22,966
政治就是权势 保罗 胡图族的权势
Politics is power, Paul, Hutu power,

40
00:03:23,035 --> 00:03:24,400
以及财富

00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:36,604
但是时间也是金钱
But time is also money,

44
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,783
今天我要在常规订单的基础上
I need six extra cases of beer today,

45
00:03:40,852 --> 00:03:42,683
再加六箱啤酒

48
00:03:58,437 --> 00:04:01,031

Put that back! Put that back! That's not beer!

49
00:04:06,378 --> 00:04:08,869
- 你 来收拾一下 - 好的 先生 来
- You, clean this up, - Yes, sir, Come on,

50
00:04:08,947 --> 00:04:11,643

53
00:04:20,025 --> 00:04:23,620
从中国买的便宜货――每把十分钱
A bargain buy from China-- ten cents each,

54
00:04:24,663 --> 00:04:27,063
知道吗 我至少能卖五十分
You know, I'll get at least fifty,

55
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:29,030
至少
At least,

56
00:04:36,441 --> 00:04:39,001
乔治・卢塔甘达是个坏人
George Rutaganda is a bad man,

57
00:04:39,077 --> 00:04:41,910
我在广播上听到 他叫胡图族屠杀所有图西族人
I've heard him on the radio telling the Hutus to kill all the Tutsis,

58
00:04:43,348 --> 00:04:46,408
卢塔甘达那帮人 都是白痴 杜比
Rutaganda and his people, they are fools, Dube,

59
00:04:46,485 --> 00:04:48,749
他们的好景到头了
Their time is soon over,

60
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,788
不管怎样 这是谈生意
Anyway, this is business,

61
00:04:56,762 --> 00:05:00,391
- 噢 不 是部族民兵 - 按他们说的做 靠边
- Oh, no, It's the lnterhamwe, - Do as they say, Pull over,

62
00:05:20,585 --> 00:05:22,644
别 别 坐直 杜比 坐直

带点笑容 杜比 别引人注目
Smile, Dube, Don't attract attention to yourself,

64
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,692
这些人有的是我邻居 他们知道我是图西族人
Some of these men are my neighbors, They know that I'm Tutsi,

65
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,285
稍微笑笑 就好像大家都是朋友 杜比
Just smile as if they are friends, Dube,

66
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:38,599

离开这儿
Get out of here,

71
00:06:00,892 --> 00:06:02,883
箱子里有水渗出
There's water coming from the box,

72
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:05,122
停在这儿 我们从前面走

十只活的 十二只死的
Ten alive, twelve are dead,

82
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,190

Oh, my goodness, Well, here, chocolates, chocolates, Who wants?

134
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:29,393
给保罗叔叔说谢谢

Things are very slow at the shop, How are things at the hotel?

139
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:48,747

143
00:10:00,932 --> 00:10:03,765
我去看看怎么回事 没事儿
I'll go see what's happening, It's all right,

144
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:10,664
- 我们知道你是图西族的 - 求求你了 先生 他是我丈夫
- We know you are Tutsi, - Please, sir, this is my husband,

145
00:10:10,742 --> 00:10:13,142
- 他只是个园丁 - 他替反叛分子当间谍
- He's just a gardener, - He's been spying for the rebels,

146
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:15,975
- 不 我们不认识反叛分子 - 你跟我们走！
- No, we do not know any rebels, - You will come with us!

147
00:10:16,047 --> 00:10:19,073
不 我们说的都是实话 我们不认识…
No, we are telling the truth, We do not know any,,,

148
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:21,384
- 怎么了？ - 别出声！
- What is it? - Shut up!

149
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:24,115
塔莎娜 回屋里去 你快回去
Tatiana, go back in the house, You must go back,

150
00:10:24,189 --> 00:10:26,157
- 你别出来 - 是维克托
- You mustn't be out here, - It's Victor,

151
00:10:29,027 --> 00:10:31,086
别 上校 你看…
No, Captain, you see--

152
00:10:31,162 --> 00:10:34,290
不是我 不是我 上校 上校
It's not me, It's not me, Captain, Captain,

153

- I know, I know, but it's not me, - You Tutsi fuckers,

155

不！不！
No! No!

156
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,471
我们得想想办法
We must do something,

157
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,236
- 想什么办法？ - 叫人
- Do what? - Call someone,

158
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,211
我不去 我不去

159
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:49,303
别！

160
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,515
带到车上去 马上！
Get him in the truck, Now!

161
00:10:58,623 --> 00:11:00,318
我们得想想办法
We must do something,

162
00:11:00,392 --> 00:11:02,451
求求你帮帮他！
Please help him!

163
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,961
噢 维克托！
Oh, Victor!

164
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,519
维克托！
Victor!

165
00:11:06,598 --> 00:11:08,463
我们无能为力
There is nothing we can do,

166
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:12,334
- 你今晚不能走 托马斯 - 好的
- You must stay the night, Thomas, - Yes,

167
00:11:15,306 --> 00:11:17,137
不！
No!

168
00:11:18,977 --> 00:11:21,036
他们为什么抓维克托？
Why would they arrest Victor?

169
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:25,146
他没从事过政治活动啊
He has no politics,

170
00:11:25,984 --> 00:11:28,748
- 他是园丁 - 谁知道 塔莎？
- He's a gardener, - Who knows, Tatsi?

171
00:11:29,921 --> 00:11:31,081
谁知道？
Who knows?

172
00:11:31,656 --> 00:11:35,057
有人看不惯他 就说他替反叛分子当间谍
Someone who didn't like him denounced him as a rebel spy,

173
00:11:36,394 --> 00:11:38,123
一直有这种事发生
Happens all the time now,

174
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:45,093
或许你可以联系一下军队里的熟人
Maybe you could call one of your contacts in the army,

175
00:11:45,837 --> 00:11:47,361
没用的
It wouldn't help,

176
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:50,770
你可以让他帮帮忙
You could ask as a favor,

177
00:11:50,842 --> 00:11:53,003
不 我不
No, I could not,

178
00:11:54,345 --> 00:11:59,146
塔莎 我整天都在取悦于这个军官、
Tatsi, all day long I work to please this officer,

179
00:11:59,217 --> 00:12:03,085
那个外交官、一些旅游的人 就是为了得到他们的支持
that diplomat, some tourist, to store up favors

180
00:12:03,154 --> 00:12:05,782
要是当“我们”需要帮助时
so if there is a time when we need help,

181
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:07,916
我能找到能起作用的人
I have powerful people I can call upon,

182
00:12:07,992 --> 00:12:10,324
可维克托是个好邻居啊
But Victor was a good neighbor,

183
00:12:10,395 --> 00:12:14,695
他不是我的家人 家人才是至关重要的
He is not family, Family is all that matters,

184
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:20,565
拜托 拜托 这件事就按我说的办
Please, please, leave these things to my good judgment,

185
00:12:36,354 --> 00:12:38,686
这个安排简直是胡扯
This assignment is bullshit,

186
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:41,817
拜托 在上等饭店呆着就没人能伤害我们了？
Come on, A few days in a nice hotel, no one shooting at us?

187
00:12:44,095 --> 00:12:47,496
先生们 欢迎光临米尔・科林斯饭店
Gentlemen, welcome to the Mille Collines,

188
00:12:47,565 --> 00:12:49,795
我是保罗・卢斯赛伯吉纳 客房经理
I am Paul Rusesabagina, the house manager,

189
00:12:49,868 --> 00:12:51,699
- 你好吗？ - 很高兴见到您
- How you doing? - Nice to meet you,

190
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,965
有任何需要 和我说便是
Anything that you need, please find me,

191
00:12:54,038 --> 00:12:55,403
- 谢谢 - 当然的
- Thank you, - Certainly,

192
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:07,042
那胡图族人和图西族人有什么区别？
So, what is the actual difference between a Hutu and a Tutsi?

193
00:13:07,118 --> 00:13:09,319
按照比利时殖民者的说法
According to the Belgian colonists, 

194
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:11,521
图西族人更高 且举止更为优雅
the Tutsis are taller and more elegant,

195
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:14,558
是比利时人区分的
It was the Belgians that created the division,

196
00:13:14,626 --> 00:13:16,116
怎么讲？
How?

197
00:13:16,194 --> 00:13:19,527
他们把鼻子较窄的、皮肤较白的人挑出来
They picked people, those with thinner noses, lighter skin,

198
00:13:19,597 --> 00:13:21,656
他们曾经测量所有人鼻子的宽度
They used to measure the width of people's noses,

199
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:24,258
比利时人利用图西族人来统治国家
The Belgians used the Tutsis to run the country,

200
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:26,667
他们离开后 又把政权交给了胡图族人
Then when they left, they left the power to the Hutus,

201
00:13:26,738 --> 00:13:29,002
当然胡图族人由于被镇压多年
and of course the Hutus took revenge

202
00:13:29,073 --> 00:13:31,337
便对图西族的政界要人采取了报复行为
on the elite Tutsis for years of repression,

203
00:13:31,409 --> 00:13:33,206
我说的对吗 保罗？
Am I telling the truth, Paul?

204
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:36,611
是的 很不幸的遭遇 请把这个给将军
Yes, unfortunately, Please take this to the general,

205
00:13:37,782 --> 00:13:40,979
本尼迪克特是基加利最好的记者 这方面的专家
Benedict is our finest journalist in Kigali, an expert on the subject,

206
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:44,052
那你是哪个族的 保罗？
So what are you, Paul?

207
00:13:46,724 --> 00:13:47,952
我是胡图族
I am Hutu,

208
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,020
先生们
Gentlemen,

209
00:13:50,094 --> 00:13:54,656
- 再来点香槟？ - 很不错 再来点香槟吧
- More champagne? - More champagne would be nice,

210
00:13:54,732 --> 00:13:58,031
抱歉 宝贝 能问个私人问题吗？
Excuse me, honey, Can I ask you a personal question?

211
00:13:58,102 --> 00:14:02,539
- 你是胡图族还是图西族？ - 我是图西族
- Are you a Hutu or a Tutsi? - I am Tutsi,

212
00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:06,441
- 你朋友呢？也是图西族？ - 不 我是胡图族
- And your friend? Tutsi? - No, I am Hutu,

213
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,511
还能是双胞胎
They could be twins,

214
00:14:11,082 --> 00:14:14,245
去拿摄像机 将军要接见我们
Get the camera, The general's going to give us an interview,

215
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:15,308
好的
Okay,

216
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:20,590
我住22号房 我想和你继续聊聊
I'm in room 22, I'd love to finish up this conversation,

217
00:14:23,461 --> 00:14:27,557
联合国高级军官声称卢旺达秘密组织了武装力量
Senior U.N. officers claim that the Rwandan army is secretly training

218
00:14:27,632 --> 00:14:30,897
将胡图族民兵装备为部落民兵
and arming the Hutu militia called the Interhamwe.

219
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:35,406
就这项声明 我采访了武装力量的领袖比齐蒙戈将军
I put this claim to the head of the armed forces, General Bizimungu.

220
00:14:35,473 --> 00:14:39,170
不 不 我们从未训练民兵
No. No, we have not been training the militia.

221
00:14:39,244 --> 00:14:41,235
联合国对此表示指责是错误的
The U. N. are mistaken in this accusation.

222
00:14:41,312 --> 00:14:43,906
你赞成总统和反叛分子签署和平协定吗？
Do you support your president's agreement to make peace with the rebels?

223
00:14:43,982 --> 00:14:47,440
全军上下都支持总统的决定
The president has the full support of the army.

224
00:14:47,518 --> 00:14:50,510
图西族叛军和哈比亚利马纳总统
That peace agreement will be signed today in Tanzania

225
00:14:50,588 --> 00:14:53,955
将于今天在坦桑尼亚签署和平协定
between Tutsi rebel forces and President Habyarimana.

226
00:14:54,025 --> 00:14:56,823
对于卢旺达 对于整个非洲来说
This is a great day for Rwanda

227
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:58,829
都是不寻常的一天
and for all of Africa,

228
00:14:58,897 --> 00:15:01,559
谈判取代了双方的对峙状态
Negotiation has replaced confrontation,,,

229
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:04,101
保罗 来喝一杯
Paul, have a drink,

230
00:15:04,168 --> 00:15:05,999
友谊取代了恐慌
Friendship has replaced fear,

231
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,334
女士们先生们 我们为和平协定的签署
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a live feed

232
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:10,271
准备了丰盛的午餐
to the signing of the peace agreement,

233
00:15:10,341 --> 00:15:13,799
为我们的总统先生干杯 希望他能重现和平
To our president, May he find peace,

234
00:15:14,812 --> 00:15:16,541
希望所有人都和平共处
May we all find peace,

235
00:15:16,614 --> 00:15:22,314
愿我们大家都致力于维护这来之不易的协定
Let us all dedicate ourselves to nurturing this hard-earned accord,

236
00:15:22,387 --> 00:15:23,649
为和平干杯！

237
00:15:23,721 --> 00:15:24,847
为和平干杯！
Peace!

238
00:15:27,058 --> 00:15:28,758
你来的话 别忘了来我这儿
Look me up if you come over,

239
00:15:28,758 --> 00:15:30,459
好的 这是个美丽的城市
Yes, it is a beautiful city,

240
00:15:30,528 --> 00:15:33,053
我正打算回去――真抱歉

243
00:15:39,904 --> 00:15:41,599
呃 这真让人吃惊
Well, this is a surprise,

244
00:15:41,673 --> 00:15:44,073
抱歉 保罗 我们得谈谈
Forgive us, Paul, We must talk,

245
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:46,911
好啊 怎么了？
Yes, what's wrong?

246
00:15:46,978 --> 00:15:49,811
据可靠消息称 保罗
I have it from a very reliable source, Paul,

247
00:15:49,881 --> 00:15:51,007
谁？
Who?

248

谢谢 萨利文
Thank you, Sullivan,

249
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,586
我的助手 胡图族的人
My assistant, the Hutu Power man,

250
00:15:59,657 --> 00:16:02,717
他说我们必须立刻离开这儿 形势马上就会变得很糟糕
He says that we must get out now, that soon it'll be very bad,

251
00:16:03,895 --> 00:16:05,328
这人叫什么名字
Give me this man's name,

252
00:16:05,396 --> 00:16:08,991

Please, Paul, even though he is lnterhamwe, he's a friend,

253
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:10,864
他是想要你的工作 托马斯
He wants your job, Thomas,

254
00:16:14,906 --> 00:16:18,137
他说有个信号

255
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,835
即“砍掉高的树木”

256
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,672
一旦听到这个讯号 民兵就会投入战斗
And when they hear this signal, the militia are to go to war,

257
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,686

但是拜托 联合国的人现在在这儿

00:36:44,601 --> 00:36:46,592
这一切很快就会过去的
Soon all of this will be over,

526
00:36:49,105 --> 00:36:51,266
要是我失去了工作怎么办 塔莎？
What if I lose my job, Tatsi?

527
00:36:54,244 --> 00:36:55,302
噢 上帝！
Oh, my God!

528
00:36:55,378 --> 00:36:57,573
- 你去哪儿？ - 我马上回来
- Where are you going? - I'll be right back,

529
00:37:17,667 --> 00:37:19,601
照顾好他们
Take care of them,

530
00:37:19,669 --> 00:37:21,000
怎么做 先生？
How, sir?

531
00:37:22,339 --> 00:37:24,830
给他们洗澡 让他们吃东西
Bathe them, feed them,

532
00:37:26,243 --> 00:37:27,574
哄他们睡觉
Put them to bed,

533
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,341
有事请我会帮你忙的
I will send you some help,

534
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,949
好了 宝贝们
Okay, babies,

535
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:41,553
我们听说了报复性屠杀的行动
We have heard reports of reprisal massacres,

536
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:44,116
联合国会出面制止流血事件的发生吗？
Will the U,N, intervene to stop the bloodshed?

537
00:37:44,194 --> 00:37:47,322
我们来这儿是为了维持和平 而非创造和平
We're here as peacekeepers, not as peacemakers,

538
00:37:47,397 --> 00:37:50,025
我下令不得对此加以干涉
My orders are not to intervene,

539
00:37:51,001 --> 00:37:52,901
- 抱歉 - 谢谢 上校
- Excuse me, - Thank you, Colonel,

540
00:37:53,603 --> 00:37:54,695
这儿 过来
Here, Over here,

541
00:37:54,771 --> 00:37:57,899
听着 我弄了辆车 我们必须马上离开
Listen, I got us a car, but we gotta move now,

542
00:37:58,642 --> 00:38:00,234
我们不能那样做 杰克
We're not allowed to do that, Jack,

543
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:03,711
大卫 那些该死的东西会把墙推倒 我们必须有所防备
David, the shit's going down outside these walls, We gotta cover it,

544
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,908
我们不会离开饭店的 除非有装甲车
We're not leaving the hotel grounds unless we have an armored car,

545
00:38:06,983 --> 00:38:09,144
- 这是章程 - 章程？
- That's the ground rules, - The ground rules?

546
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:11,050
你以为我们这是在哪儿？他妈的温布尔登吗？
Where do you think we are, fucking Wimbledon?

547
00:38:11,121 --> 00:38:16,115
就此作罢 直到弄到合适的交通工具 杰克
We cover the story from here until we get the proper vehicles, Jack,

548
00:38:16,192 --> 00:38:18,626
去拍摄些名单B中的难民吧
Shoot some "B" roll of the refugees,

549
00:38:24,334 --> 00:38:25,562
我们走
Let's go,

550
00:38:25,635 --> 00:38:28,263
上校 我无法确保这些人的安全
Colonel, I have no way to protect these people,

551
00:38:28,338 --> 00:38:31,205
我这儿的房间装不下这么多难民
And I have more refugees than I have room for as it is,

552
00:38:31,274 --> 00:38:34,710
红十字会今天带来了20名孤儿
I was given 20 orphans today by the Red Cross,

553
00:38:34,778 --> 00:38:36,837
这儿不是难民营
This is not a refugee camp,

554
00:38:36,913 --> 00:38:39,108
你不能把他们带去你那儿吗？
Can you not take them with you to your facilities?

555
00:38:39,182 --> 00:38:42,447
不行 我不能那样 保罗 抱歉
No, I can't do that, Paul, I'm sorry,

556
00:38:43,353 --> 00:38:46,083
我的难民营很令人担忧
I'm overwhelmed at my refugee camp,

557
00:38:46,156 --> 00:38:48,750
那儿一直在打仗 持续的战斗
I'm under attack, constant attack,

558
00:38:48,825 --> 00:38:52,727
一旦我们控制住局势 我就带他们去那儿
As soon as we can stabilize this situation, then I'll take 'em,

559
00:38:55,665 --> 00:39:00,364
…防止那些试图逃脱审判的图西族蟑螂
...and stop the Tutsi cockroaches who try to run from justice.

560
00:39:00,437 --> 00:39:04,965
一名叫马吉萨的图西族法官躲在4个…
The Tutsi cockroach judge called Makesa is hiding at 4...

561
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:11,944
- …喀布尔和他的同伙… - 关掉收音机
-... Kabulla and his cockroaches... - Turn that radio off,

562
00:39:12,749 --> 00:39:14,444
他的情况将被密切关注 他…
Watch out for him. He--

563
00:39:16,853 --> 00:39:20,619
回去工作 我们必须让饭店正常运作
And get back to work, We have a hotel to run,

564
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:23,887
这儿没什么好干的了 老板都走了
There's no work here anyway, The boss has left,

565
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,655
我就是你们的老板！
I am your boss!

566
00:39:39,075 --> 00:39:43,068
先生 卢旺达米尔・科林斯饭店来电 一号线
Sir, there's a call from the Mille Collines in Rwanda on line one.

567
00:39:43,146 --> 00:39:45,706
什么？你哪位？
Yes? Who am I speaking to?

568
00:39:46,416 --> 00:39:49,977
是的 先生 我是保罗・卢斯赛伯吉纳 客房经理
Yes, sir, Paul Rusesabagina, the house manager,

569
00:39:50,053 --> 00:39:52,146
上次你来这儿是我们见过面 提伦斯先生
I met you on your last visit here, Mr, Tillens,

570
00:39:52,222 --> 00:39:54,986
啊 是的 保罗 我记得
Ah, yes, Paul, I remember,

571
00:39:55,058 --> 00:39:56,821
情况怎么样了？
How are things there?

572
00:39:56,893 --> 00:39:59,191
很复杂 先生
The situation is difficult, sir.

573
00:40:00,563 --> 00:40:04,727
有部分董事觉得我们应该关闭米尔・科林斯饭店
Some of our directors believe we should close the Mille Collines

574
00:40:04,801 --> 00:40:06,826
直到动荡的局面结束
until this unrest is over,

575
00:40:06,903 --> 00:40:10,532
我对此拿不定主意 保罗 你觉得呢？
I'm not sure about that, Paul. What do you think?

576
00:40:13,042 --> 00:40:17,274
先生 那会对我们的声誉造成不良影响
Sir, that would be very bad for our reputation,

577
00:40:17,347 --> 00:40:21,613
米尔・科林斯饭店对于忠实的消费者来说就是一片平静的绿洲
The Mille Collines is an oasis of calm for all our loyal customers,

578
00:40:21,684 --> 00:40:24,915
比利时航空公司弃之不顾 他们会怎么想？
What would they think if Sabena deserted them now?

579
00:40:24,988 --> 00:40:28,082
我想你保证 联合国已经控制了一切 先生
I assure you, the United Nations have everything under control, sir,

580
00:40:29,592 --> 00:40:31,492
很好 保罗 很好
Very well, Paul, Very well,

581
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:35,497
但如果形势变得更严峻 我们还得关闭
But if this thing gets worse, we must close,

582
00:40:35,565 --> 00:40:38,864
要是有什么需要我帮忙的 给我电话
If there is anything I can do, please call,

583
00:40:39,502 --> 00:40:42,994
先生 是的 我现在正有一件事需要你帮忙
Sir, yes, there is one thing I'm going to be needing from you right away,

584
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,935
告诉大家 我这样请求大家显得很尴尬
Let me tell you, it was an embarrassment for me to have to ask for this,

585
00:40:48,745 --> 00:40:50,827
在场的大多数人都相互认识
Most of us in this room have known each other

586
00:40:50,827 --> 00:40:52,909
并在一起共事多年
and worked together for many years,

587
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:58,043
真的需要我致函比利时方面
Is it really necessary for me to get a letter from Belgium

588
00:40:58,121 --> 00:40:59,850
来让你们继续工作吗？
for you to perform your duties?

589
00:41:04,427 --> 00:41:07,419
实际上 别在乎这封信
In fact, forget this letter,

590
00:41:07,497 --> 00:41:09,527
要是你们不想为我工作
If you don't want to work for me and 

591
00:41:09,527 --> 00:41:11,558
而情愿出去 那现在就离开吧
would rather be out there, then leave now,

592
00:41:16,806 --> 00:41:20,401
拜托 各位 回到工作岗位上去
Please, everyone, back to work,

593
00:41:26,182 --> 00:41:28,241
保罗 感谢你来
Paul, thank you for coming,

594
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:30,081
空调不能用了
The air conditioner's on the blink,

595
00:41:30,081 --> 00:41:31,845
你能帮我看看吗？
is there any way you can have a look at it?

596
00:41:31,921 --> 00:41:33,786
- 这是我最后一天了 - 当然
- I'm just on a deadline, - Certainly,

597
00:41:33,857 --> 00:41:38,055
弗雷德 告诉我你何时收到卫星信号的 谢谢
Fred, let me know when you get the satellite feed, Thanks,

598
00:41:38,661 --> 00:41:42,620
弗莱明先生 我还给你带了些茶叶来 先生
Mr, Fleming, I brought you some tea as well, sir,

599
00:41:42,699 --> 00:41:44,132
谢谢 保罗
Thank you, Paul,

600
00:41:45,401 --> 00:41:47,699
你是沙漠里的一片绿洲
You're an oasis in the desert,

601
00:41:49,105 --> 00:41:51,266
…政府和军队的人
...the elements of the government and army

602
00:41:51,341 --> 00:41:55,072
正在效仿索马里的美国人的做法
are following the example of what happened to the Americans in Somalia.

603
00:41:55,144 --> 00:42:01,014
我认为他们意欲胁迫我们 试图袭击我们…
I think they intend to intimidate us, try to attack us, and...

604
00:42:01,084 --> 00:42:04,713
希望西方能考虑撤军
hope that the West will pull all its troops out.

605
00:42:04,787 --> 00:42:07,187
- 你认为他们会成功吗？ - 不 当然不会
- Do you think they'll succeed? - No, they won't.

606
00:42:07,257 --> 00:42:08,656
联合国维和部队就驻扎在这儿
The U. N. 's here to stay.

607
00:42:08,725 --> 00:42:10,386
总统的飞机被击落后
What about the outbreak of violence

608
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,428
暴力事件的情况如何？
since the shooting down of the president's plane?

609
00:42:12,495 --> 00:42:15,293
你到底在干什么？
What the hell do you think you're doing?

610
00:42:15,365 --> 00:42:18,425
我要对这些人的安全负责
I'm responsible for the safety of this crew,

611
00:42:21,004 --> 00:42:22,301
什么？
What is this?

612
00:42:52,402 --> 00:42:55,235
- 哪儿拍的？ - 沿途半英里处
- Where did you get this? - Half a mile down the road,

613
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:57,635
弗雷德 我是大卫
Fred, it's David,

614
00:42:57,707 --> 00:43:00,540
我拿到了让人难以置信的录像 关于集体屠杀
I've got incredible footage, It's a massacre,

615
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:03,306
死尸 以及弯刀
Dead bodies, machetes,

616
00:43:03,379 --> 00:43:06,507
如果我立即赶过去 你能播报晚间新闻吗？
If I get this through right away, can you make the evening news?

617
00:43:07,483 --> 00:43:08,575
好
Yeah,

618
00:43:13,856 --> 00:43:15,551
这个必须头条播报
You have to lead with this,

619
00:43:16,793 --> 00:43:18,852
我是说你 你来试试看
I point at you, you do a shot,

620
00:43:18,928 --> 00:43:22,921
你会得到两倍的偿还 看看是否所有的酒…
And you'll get a total double and see if all the drinking--

621
00:43:22,999 --> 00:43:25,024
- 抱歉 达格里什先生 - 嘿 保罗
- Excuse me, Mr, Daglish, - Hey, Paul,

622
00:43:25,802 --> 00:43:28,862
听我说 之前的事很抱歉
Listen, sorry about earlier,

623
00:43:28,938 --> 00:43:31,566
如果我知道你在那儿 我就不会…
If I'd known you were in there, I wouldn't have--

624
00:43:31,641 --> 00:43:36,442
你拍下这段录像我很高兴 全世界都能看到
I am glad that you have shot this footage and that the world will see it,

625
00:43:36,512 --> 00:43:39,606
这是我们有机会让人干涉的唯一办法
It is the only way we have a chance that people might intervene,

626
00:43:42,885 --> 00:43:47,219
不错 但要是没人来干涉 披露这些还会是好事吗？
Yeah, and if no one intervenes, is it still a good thing to show?

627
00:43:48,992 --> 00:43:52,928
人们看到这种暴行 怎么会不干涉呢？
How can they not intervene when they witness such atrocities?

628
00:43:52,996 --> 00:43:57,365
我认为如果人们看到这些录像…
I think if people see this footage,,,

629
00:43:58,468 --> 00:44:01,062
…他们会说 “噢 上帝 太恐怖了”
,,,they'll say, "Oh, my God, that's horrible,"

630
00:44:01,137 --> 00:44:02,968
然后便继续享用他们的晚餐
and then go on eating their dinners,

631
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:10,873
我到底在想什么？听着 想去放松一下吗？
What the hell do I know? Listen, you wanna just relax?

632
00:44:10,947 --> 00:44:13,609
我还有事情要做 谢谢你的邀请
I have more work to do, I thank you for your offer,

633
00:44:13,683 --> 00:44:15,913
祝你晚上过得愉快 达格里什先生
Please enjoy your evening, Mr, Daglish,

634
00:44:19,956 --> 00:44:22,891

- Help! Please help us! Please! - Sir! Sir!

635
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:24,984
门口出事了
We've got trouble at the gate,

636
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:30,358
请问这儿有医疗援助吗？

本尼迪克特 怎么回事？
Benedict, what is happening?

640
00:44:39,108 --> 00:44:42,043
他们杀了所有人 妇女…
They're killing everyone, The lady,,,

641
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:44,875
部族民兵包围了整个城市
The lnterhamwe have surrounded the whole town,

642
00:44:44,947 --> 00:44:46,107
快！

643
00:44:46,649 --> 00:44:48,640
开路 马上
Cover the road, Now,

644
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:51,077
站好岗
Stand your ground,

645

坚持
Hold the line,

646
00:44:54,123 --> 00:44:56,489
别开枪！别开枪！
Do not shoot! Do not shoot!

647
00:45:23,019 --> 00:45:25,681
- 中尉 去看着门口 - 是 先生
- Lieutenant, guard this gate, - Yes, sir,

648
00:45:26,189 --> 00:45:29,158
你们俩 到沙袋后面去
You two, take up positions behind those sandbags,

649
00:45:29,225 --> 00:45:34,390
他们杀了我们的人 维和部队死了十个比利时士兵
They murdered my men, I lost ten Belgian U,N, soldiers,

650
00:45:34,464 --> 00:45:36,898
他们是在保护女首相的安全
They were protecting the lady prime minister,

651
00:45:36,966 --> 00:45:39,093
- 她死了？ - 不错 死了
- She is dead? - Yeah, she's dead,

652
00:45:40,503 --> 00:45:44,098
欧洲人正在集结武装准备干涉

655
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,439
但这些人我没办法安置了

656
00:45:49,512 --> 00:45:50,877
我能怎么办？

00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:11,859
你好
Hello,

662
00:46:13,002 --> 00:46:16,165
- 我们五天前就一直等着你 - 抱歉
- We were expecting you five days ago, - I'm sorry,

663
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:18,730
我哥哥的家人 你找到了吗？
My brother and his family, did you find them?

664
00:46:18,808 --> 00:46:21,538
我到了他们的住处 但屋里没人
I made it to the house, but it was empty,

665
00:46:21,611 --> 00:46:24,171
- 没人？ - 一定是被搜查过了
- Empty? - It had been ransacked,

666
00:46:25,414 --> 00:46:28,577
我走的时候 一位老太太朝我招手
As I left, an old woman, she waved to me,

667
00:46:28,651 --> 00:46:32,678
我去了她家 有两个小女孩 她们都很安全
I went to the house, She has the two little girls, They're safe,

668
00:46:32,755 --> 00:46:34,313

Okay,

669
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:36,153
但是…
But,,,

670
00:46:36,225 --> 00:46:40,628
我哥哥和他妻子…那个老太太知道他们的下落吗？
My brother and his wife-- did the old lady know of them?

671
00:46:43,833 --> 00:46:47,769
我哥哥一定死了 他们不会留下孩子们的
My brother is dead, They would never leave their children,

672
00:46:47,837 --> 00:46:51,364
或许他们没有回家 塔莎娜 他们藏起来了
Perhaps they could not make it home, Tatiana, They are hiding,

673
00:46:52,909 --> 00:46:55,935
拜托 您能回去帮我把女孩们带过来吗？
Please, can you return and bring the girls back here to us?

674
00:46:56,012 --> 00:46:59,743
不行 到处都是部落民兵设置的路障
I can't, There are lnterhamwe roadblocks everywhere,

675
00:47:03,486 --> 00:47:05,477
当我到达孤儿院…
When I reached the orphanage,,,

676
00:47:06,756 --> 00:47:08,690
…部落民兵也在那儿
,,,the lnterhamwe were there,

677
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:12,492
他们已经开始杀戮孩子
They'd already started killing children,

678
00:47:13,229 --> 00:47:14,890
他们让我看
They made me watch,

679
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:19,825
有个女孩
There was one girl,

680
00:47:19,902 --> 00:47:22,530
他背上绑着个小妹妹
she had her little sister wrapped on her back,

681
00:47:26,409 --> 00:47:29,503
他们朝她砍去的一瞬间 她朝我大喊
As they were about to chop her, she cried out to me,

682
00:47:32,014 --> 00:47:34,005
“求求你别让他们杀我
"Please don't let them kill me,

683
00:47:35,284 --> 00:47:37,946
我发誓我再也不做图西族人了”
I promise I won't be Tutsi anymore,"

684
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,784
拜托 我不能
Please, I can't,

685
00:47:48,164 --> 00:47:50,246
他们的目标就是图西族的孩子
They're targeting Tutsi children,

686
00:47:50,246 --> 00:47:52,328
保罗 他们要将下一代铲除干净
Paul, to wipe out the next generation,

687
00:48:00,743 --> 00:48:03,906
我带着孤儿不知该去何处 保罗
I've nowhere to take the orphans, Paul,

688
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:08,440
别担心了 马上就会有武装力量来干涉了
Don't worry, There will be an intervention force coming soon,

689
00:48:09,485 --> 00:48:11,612
到时候再让孤儿们出去
We will get the orphans out then,

690
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,862

我方无能为力
We can do nothing from our side,

704
00:49:18,921 --> 00:49:21,583

They think you're dirt, they think you're dung, You're worthless,

他们都是胆小怕事的人 保罗

让他们知道 如果他们放手…

…你们就会死亡

939

我们要让他们感到惭愧 以至于来帮助我们

会发生种族屠杀呢？
as to whether or not what is happening could be genocide?

954
01:06:27,627 --> 01:06:31,028
我们有足够的证据表明种族屠杀行动已经发生

很明显 你没有孤立地使用…
Is it true that you have specific guidance

958
01:06:42,642 --> 01:06:45,133
“种族屠杀”这个说法 而总是使用…
not to use the word "genocide" in isolation.

959
01:06:45,212 --> 01:06:47,806
“**行动”的说法 是这样的吗？
but always to preface it with this word "acts of"?

960
01:06:49,349 --> 01:06:54,412
我尽可能使用我觉得最好的说法
I have guidance which I try to use as best as I can.

There are formulations that we are using

But when I last spoke to the president of Sabena,

974
01:07:36,830 --> 01:07:38,320

975
01:07:39,332 --> 01:07:40,663
我看看我能不能帮忙

先生 格莱戈瓦拿走了啤酒

没有威士忌 烈酒都没有了

十袋豆荚 来 快点

1052
01:13:17,637 --> 01:13:20,162
都装上车 你
And put those in the van. You.

1053
01:13:21,774 --> 01:13:23,765
我要提醒一下你 朋友
Let me give you a little tip, my friend.

1054
01:13:23,843 --> 01:13:26,573
我们军队将军说 “别靠近米勒・科林斯饭店
Our generals in army say, "Don't go near the Mille Collines

1055
01:13:26,646 --> 01:13:28,841
否则他们会派比利时士兵来这儿”
or they will send the Belgian soldiers back here."

1056
01:13:28,915 --> 01:13:33,181
很快这些将军会离开 由我们负责
But soon those generals will have gone and we will be in charge.

1057
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:38,652
到时候就开始屠宰你的肥牛了
It's time to butcher that fat cow of yours for the meat.

1058
01:13:49,569 --> 01:13:50,968
我们走
Let's go.

1059
01:13:53,907 --> 01:13:55,898
或许你可以帮我 保罗
Maybe you could help us, Paul.

1060
01:13:55,975 --> 01:13:58,842
你旅馆里有很重要的叛徒
You have some very important traitors at that hotel.

1061
01:13:59,512 --> 01:14:01,343
如果我们去把他们抓来
Now, if we were to get them,

1062
01:14:01,414 --> 01:14:05,214
或许我们会让你留下一两只蟑螂在你身边
then maybe we would let you have one or two cockroaches of your own.

1063
01:14:07,153 --> 01:14:08,552
明白吗？
Do you understand?

1064
01:14:10,590 --> 01:14:13,423
天快亮了 乔治
It is almost dawn, George.

1065
01:14:13,493 --> 01:14:15,586
我们真的要走了
We really must be going.

1066
01:14:17,363 --> 01:14:20,560
回去时走河边 比较安全
Take the river road back. It's clear.

1067
01:14:42,255 --> 01:14:44,849
- 格莱戈瓦 - 怎么了？
- Gregoire. - What is going on now?

1068
01:14:44,924 --> 01:14:47,154
- 你开出路了 - 不 我在路上
- You've driven off the road. - No, I'm on the road.

1069
01:14:47,226 --> 01:14:50,059
你要让我们都掉河里去？停车 停车
You're going to put us in the river. Stop the car, stop the car.

1070
01:16:14,614 --> 01:16:16,309
倒车 格莱戈瓦
Back up the car, Gregoire.

1071
01:16:18,217 --> 01:16:19,377
听我说
Listen to me.

1072
01:16:20,987 --> 01:16:24,150
今天看到的对谁都别讲
You will tell no one what you have seen here today.

1073
01:16:24,223 --> 01:16:25,622
谁都别讲 格莱戈瓦
No one, Gregoire.

1074
01:16:41,941 --> 01:16:45,934

Hundreds.

1084
01:18:53,172 --> 01:18:55,265
不计其数
It was too many to count.

1085
01:18:58,811 --> 01:19:01,279
为什么这些人这么残忍？
Why are people so cruel?
