00:13:26,612 --> 00:13:29,815
朱洛特 帮我看着这个吊床
{\fs12}Julot, make sure no one takes this hammock.

132
00:13:35,588 --> 00:13:38,823
我在旁边给你留了地方
{\fs12}I saved you a spot next to me.

133
00:13:38,825 --> 00:13:40,560
有很多人盯着你
{\fs12}You got a lot of eyes on you.

134
00:13:41,927 --> 00:13:44,160
我能保证你的安全
{\fs12}I can keep you safe.

135
00:13:44,162 --> 00:13:46,666
但我需要钱逃跑
{\fs12}All I need's enough money for an escape.

136
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:50,100
不便宜 但保证你的安全
{\fs12}Won't be cheap, but you'll be safe.

137
00:13:50,102 --> 00:13:52,837
黄鼠狼给鸡拜年吗
{\fs12}Said the scorpion to the frog.

138
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:55,539
我们都是黄鼠狼 伙计
{\fs12}We're all scorpions in here, pal.

139
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:59,242
我还不如打点警卫
{\fs12}I think I'd be better off taking my chances setting up in front of the guards.

140
00:13:59,244 --> 00:14:00,596
你同意吗
{\fs12}Wouldn't you agree?

141
00:14:01,714 --> 00:14:04,450
你似乎是那种很有思想的人
{\fs12}You seem like the kind of man who can make up his own mind.

142
00:14:05,584 --> 00:14:07,686
你判断人很准
{\fs12}You're a good judge of character.

143
00:14:09,955 --> 00:14:11,858
祝你晚安
{\fs12}Have a good night.

144
00:14:12,624 --> 00:14:14,460
也祝你晚安
{\fs12}Yeah, you too.

145
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:23,100
嘿
{\fs12}Hey.

146
00:14:23,102 --> 00:14:24,905
我们组队逃跑吧
{\fs12}Me and you, we should team up for an escape.

147
00:14:27,006 --> 00:14:31,011
如果由于计划不周逃跑被抓 我宁可是自己的错
{\fs12}If I get caught in some half-assed escape, I want it to be my mistake.

148
00:14:35,748 --> 00:14:37,184
全都给我安静
{\fs12}Settle down now!

149
00:15:19,925 --> 00:15:21,592
嘘
{\fs12}Shh.

150
00:15:35,807 --> 00:15:38,611
我知道你把钱藏在肚子里
{\fs12}I know you hide your money in your guts.

151
00:16:24,022 --> 00:16:25,157
顶层甲板
{\fs12}Upper deck.

152
00:16:26,257 --> 00:16:27,192
全都给我回去
{\fs12}Move it back. Back, you.

153
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,126
退后
{\fs12}Back. Back up.

154
00:16:30,128 --> 00:16:31,565
把他带出去
{\fs12}Get him outta here.

155
00:16:32,831 --> 00:16:35,098
这些畜生可以自己清理烂摊子
{\fs12}The animals can clean up their own mess.

156
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,933
去把他扔掉
{\fs12}Come on. Get rid of him.

157
00:16:36,935 --> 00:16:38,604
好戏结束了
{\fs12}Show's over.

158
00:17:05,331 --> 00:17:07,634
昨晚睡得怎么样
{\fs12}How'd you sleep last night?

159
00:17:14,305 --> 00:17:16,739
有自由的味道
{\fs12}Smells like freedom.

160
00:17:16,741 --> 00:17:19,144
你听说过有人越狱吗
{\fs12}What, you've heard of someone escaping the prison?

161
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:22,079
越了也不一定能成功
{\fs12}Doesn't mean it can't be done.

162
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:25,082
我感觉希望渺茫
{\fs12}I have trouble seeing hope in hopelessness.

163
00:17:25,084 --> 00:17:27,053
我需要你这样的人
{\fs12}That's why I need a man like you.

164
00:17:28,688 --> 00:17:31,021
我重新考虑了你的提议
{\fs12}I've reconsidered your offer.

165
00:17:31,023 --> 00:17:34,425
保证我活着 直到我们到岛上
{\fs12}Keep me alive until I'm set up on the island,

166
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:36,730
你任何越狱的费用由我支付
{\fs12}I'll underwrite any escape you care to arrange.

167
00:17:43,401 --> 00:17:44,804
行
{\fs12}All right.

168
00:17:47,773 --> 00:17:50,243
届时你又不会跟我走
{\fs12}And when the time comes, you're not comin' with me.

169
00:17:52,344 --> 00:17:55,178
我并不想逃
{\fs12}I have no intention of escaping.

170
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,848
不像你 我只是想活着
{\fs12}Unlike you, I enjoy being alive.

171
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,882
我老婆在忙我的上诉
{\fs12}My wife's working on my appeal.

172
00:17:59,884 --> 00:18:02,254
我圣诞节之前能到家的

185
00:20:16,555 --> 00:20:19,555
脱衣 排队 畜生们 否则再次放蒸汽
{\fs12}Strip and line up, you fuckin' animals, or it's the steam again.

第一次逃跑未果
{\fs12}If you manage to survive your first attempt,

266
00:26:18,717 --> 00:26:20,419
如果你杀了人

267
00:26:22,254 --> 00:26:23,789
你会被处决的
{\fs12}you'll be executed.

268
00:26:25,824 --> 00:26:27,226
就这样
{\fs12}That's all.

269
00:26:43,976 --> 00:26:45,545
让开
{\fs12}Move. Move.

270
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:02,495
上帝啊
{\fs12}Jesus Christ.

271
00:27:11,569 --> 00:27:13,238
去角落
{\fs12}Take the corner.

272
00:27:22,447 --> 00:27:24,417
睁大眼睛 别动
{\fs12}Hey, keep your eyes open and don't move.

273
00:27:30,322 --> 00:27:32,925
谁决定分配工作的
{\fs12}Who decides what work we get assigned to?

274
00:27:35,661 --> 00:27:38,663
原谅我的无礼 - 我不是叫你别动吗
{\fs12}Excuse my ill-mannered... - I thought I told you not to move.

275
00:27:39,864 --> 00:27:41,531
他还不够顺从
{\fs12}He has yet to be tamed.

276
00:27:41,533 --> 00:27:44,601
显然您是个大忙人
{\fs12}And you're obviously a very important, very, very busy man.

277
00:27:44,603 --> 00:27:46,602
我只是狱吏
{\fs12}I'm just the turnkey.

278
00:27:46,604 --> 00:27:50,907
我们要找一个人 保证我们被分配到
{\fs12}We're looking for someone to ensure we're assigned

279
00:27:50,909 --> 00:27:53,246

这要一千块钱
{\fs12}It'll cost you a thousand.

281
00:27:56,715 --> 00:27:57,846
我不这么认为
{\fs12}I don't think so.

282
00:27:57,887 --> 00:28:00,459
这显然是狮子大开口
{\fs12}No, now that seems entirely too high.

283
00:28:03,488 --> 00:28:06,622
先生 看来我们搞错了
{\fs12}Sir, I think we started off on the wrong foot.

284
00:28:06,624 --> 00:28:10,459
一千块其实很公平
{\fs12}I think a thousand is actually fair.

285
00:28:10,461 --> 00:28:11,995
现在工作有没有得选...
{\fs12}Now, is there a selection of work you have...

比如去医院
{\fs12}Attendants at the hospital.

287
00:28:15,534 --> 00:28:17,766
一千块足够买一袋烟草
{\fs12}And for a thousand, you can throw in a pouch of tobacco.

288
00:28:17,768 --> 00:28:19,601

{\fs12}And a notebook. - A notebook?

289

我是艺术家 - 你是伪造犯
{\fs12}I'm an artist. - You're a forger.

290
00:28:21,873 --> 00:28:25,909
你是个窃贼 我对这个职业无感
{\fs12}And you're a safecracker, a profession of which I thoroughly disapprove.

291
00:28:25,911 --> 00:28:27,643
但我是个诚实的罪犯
{\fs12}At least I'm an honest criminal. - Hmm.

292
00:28:27,645 --> 00:28:30,449
现在就得给钱
{\fs12}Hey. I'm gonna need that right now.

293
00:28:31,115 --> 00:28:32,549
我是说现在
{\fs12}I mean, right now.

294

295
00:28:36,555 --> 00:28:40,593
我想你得去洗手间了
{\fs12}I think you need to go to the bathroom.

296
00:28:43,728 --> 00:28:45,498
当然
{\fs12}Yes, of course.

297
00:28:46,565 --> 00:28:48,190
恕我失陪 先生们
{\fs12}If you'll excuse me, gentlemen.

298
00:28:52,871 --> 00:28:55,071
你要去哪
{\fs12}Where you goin'?

299
00:28:55,073 --> 00:28:56,876
我又没来过这里
{\fs12}I've never been here before.

300
00:28:58,776 --> 00:29:00,946
马桶在那儿 公主
{\fs12}Toilet's there, princess.

301
00:29:09,153 --> 00:29:13,959
什么样的人会把谋生之物藏在屁股里
{\fs12}What animal but a man keeps his only means of survival up his ass?

302
00:29:55,933 --> 00:29:57,969
有东西咬我
{\fs12}Something bit me.

303
00:30:11,615 --> 00:30:13,882
有人跑了
{\fs12}We got a runner!

307
00:30:20,225 --> 00:30:21,658
把你们这营门锁起来
{\fs12}Lock down your barrack.

308
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,861
我肯定是朱洛特 - 锁门
{\fs12}I'll bet that's Julot. - Lock it down!

309
00:30:24,863 --> 00:30:26,731
这家伙急得不可救药
{\fs12}Son of a bitch didn't waste any time.

310
00:30:33,153 --> 00:30:33,969

你觉得呢

我信任谁也比信小偷好
{\fs12}I should have known better than to trust a thief.

381

对不起
{\fs12}I'm sorry.

386
00:36:53,451 --> 00:36:58,357
因为我用怀疑的眼光误判了你
{\fs12}I may have prematurely judged you with an unworthy degree of suspicion.

387
00:36:59,524 --> 00:37:01,591
你就少得瑟了
{\fs12}Well, don't propose yet.

388
00:37:01,593 --> 00:37:04,060
我只是不喜欢屁股缝里夹着东西
{\fs12}I just don't like carrying things in my ass.

389
00:37:27,886 --> 00:37:29,235

我不知道会这样
{\fs12}I didn't know it would be like this.

{\fs12}I was locked in a cage for most of them.

455
00:44:31,075 --> 00:44:34,909
所以我很理解这个概念
{\fs12}But I think I understand the concept well enough.

456

你不能跟我走 德加

501
00:52:16,554 --> 00:52:17,889
没在我身上

但我会给你的
{\fs12}But I'm gonna make it worth your while.

503
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:22,009
我在巴黎很有钱
{\fs12}I got a lot of money in Paris.

504
00:52:22,627 --> 00:52:24,748
我会把所有的都给你
{\fs12}I'll give you everything I got.

505
00:52:45,335 --> 00:52:47,752
即使你有钱
{\fs12}Even if you had the money...

506
00:52:48,238 --> 00:52:50,871
典狱长会付给我们双倍的钱
{\fs12}the warden will pay us double.

507
00:52:50,873 --> 00:52:52,442
王八蛋
{\fs12}Son of a bitch.

508
00:53:29,111 --> 00:53:31,629
你很幸运 警卫没死
{\fs12}You're lucky that guard didn't die.

509
00:53:32,082 --> 00:53:34,298
否则你会上断头台的
{\fs12}Otherwise, you would have met the guillotine.

510
00:53:34,984 --> 00:53:38,420
现在你将被转移到圣约瑟夫岛
{\fs12}Now you'll be transferred to the island of Saint Joseph,

511
00:53:38,422 --> 00:53:42,527
在那里单独关两年
{\fs12}where you'll serve a two-year sentence in solitary confinement.

512
00:53:43,527 --> 00:53:45,435
没有医疗
{\fs12}There's no rehabilitation.

513
00:53:45,962 --> 00:53:48,096
因为毫无用处
{\fs12}We know that's useless,

514
00:53:48,098 --> 00:53:50,535
我们会尽力让你崩溃的
{\fs12}so we do our best to break you.

515
00:53:55,172 --> 00:53:57,375
那里经常有怪事
{\fs12}Strange things happen there.

516
00:53:59,042 --> 00:54:01,576
尤其是那些抱着希望的人
{\fs12}Especially to those who cling to hope,

517
00:54:01,578 --> 00:54:04,411
因为在圣约瑟夫岛 没有希望
{\fs12}because there is no hope on Saint Joseph.

518
00:54:04,413 --> 00:54:06,149
只有沉默
{\fs12}Just silence.

519
00:54:21,931 --> 00:54:24,165
你听到典狱长说的了
{\fs12}You heard the warden.

520
00:54:24,167 --> 00:54:27,004
时刻保持沉默
{\fs12}Silence must be observed at all times.

521
00:57:28,752 --> 00:57:31,122
还以为你插了翅膀
{\fs12}Thought you grew wings, didn't you?

522
00:57:35,725 --> 00:57:37,395
抓住他
{\fs12}Grab him.

523
00:57:39,728 --> 00:57:41,503
我教教你什么是安静
{\fs12}I'll teach you to be quiet.

524
00:57:49,672 --> 00:57:51,341
你再敢偷窥
{\fs12}You make another peep...

525
00:57:52,509 --> 00:57:55,079
你就别想再活了
{\fs12}you might not survive your time here.

526
00:58:29,879 --> 00:58:32,282
他疯了 我们走吧
{\fs12}Come on. He's crazy. Come on. Come on.

527
00:58:35,285 --> 00:58:37,559
好好享受你的两年
{\fs12}Enjoy your next two years here.

528
01:00:07,441 --> 01:00:12,321
<i>⚔你的桶里每天会有一枚椰子 从现在起</i>

529
01:00:54,556 --> 01:00:56,593
德加
{\fs12}Dega.

530
01:02:08,765 --> 01:02:11,368
等等 需要检查
{\fs12}Hold on. Need to check that.

531
01:02:16,406 --> 01:02:18,680
那是什么
{\fs12}What is that, hmm?

532
01:02:19,475 --> 01:02:21,975
谁付钱让你带进来的 王八蛋
{\fs12}Somebody paying you to bring this shit in here? Son of a bitch.

533
01:02:21,977 --> 01:02:23,643
谁付钱给你的
{\fs12}Huh? Who's paying you?

534
01:02:23,645 --> 01:02:25,480
谁付你钱 你个孙子
{\fs12}Who's paying you, you son of a bitch?

535
01:02:27,549 --> 01:02:28,752
不
{\fs12}No!

536
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:36,392
天那 你是不是杀了他
{\fs12}Jesus! I think you killed him.

537
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,728
把尸体弄出去 收拾干净
{\fs12}Get that body out of here and clean up the mess.

538
01:02:42,131 --> 01:02:44,033
你到底在想什么
{\fs12}What the hell were you thinking?

539
01:03:04,687 --> 01:03:06,989
难怪你还没有崩溃
{\fs12}No wonder you haven't broken yet.

540
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:12,895
有多久了
{\fs12}How long has it being going on?

541
01:03:14,596 --> 01:03:16,667
你可以说话
{\fs12}You may speak.

542
01:03:20,035 --> 01:03:22,372
送椰子的是谁
{\fs12}Who sent you those coconuts?

543
01:03:34,017 --> 01:03:35,919
如果不坦白
{\fs12}If you don't fess up...

544
01:03:37,453 --> 01:03:39,555
口粮减一半
{\fs12}I'll put you on half rations.

545
01:03:43,625 --> 01:03:45,995
交出那个人就饶你一命
{\fs12}You're choosing another man's life over your own.

546
01:04:02,812 --> 01:04:04,748
口粮减一半
{\fs12}Put him on half rations.

547
01:06:12,174 --> 01:06:14,143
我给你带了点汤来
{\fs12}I brought you some soup.

548
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:19,116
里面有肉
{\fs12}It's got meat in it.

549
01:06:41,738 --> 01:06:43,140
说出他的名字
{\fs12}Just tell me his name.

550
01:06:52,681 --> 01:06:54,618
说出他的名字
{\fs12}Tell me his name.

551
01:07:22,277 --> 01:07:25,181
人发疯的时候 自己会知道吗
{\fs12}You think a person knows when he's going mad?

552
01:07:27,716 --> 01:07:29,799
或者你认为这反而是一种盲目乐观
{\fs12}Or you think it's blissful ignorance?

553
01:07:30,919 --> 01:07:32,622
因为答案要靠你自己找
{\fs12}'Cause you're about to find out.

554
01:07:45,902 --> 01:07:49,469
剩下的刑期让他在黑暗中过
{\fs12}Put him in darkness for the remainder of his sentence.

555
01:07:49,471 --> 01:07:51,205
也可能刑期未满 就死了
{\fs12}Or the remainder of his life,

556
01:07:51,207 --> 01:07:52,843
以先到者为准
{\fs12}whichever comes first.

557
01:10:27,330 --> 01:10:28,899
6
{\fs12}Six.

559
01:10:41,611 --> 01:10:43,246
24
{\fs12}Twenty-four.

560
01:10:58,461 --> 01:10:59,996
6-2-24
{\fs12}6-2-24.

561
01:11:07,603 --> 01:11:09,069
24
{\fs12}Twenty-four.

562
01:11:28,925 --> 01:11:31,027
逃的不错
{\fs12}This is a good escape.

563
01:12:36,358 --> 01:12:37,928
他还活着吗
{\fs12}Is he still alive?

564
01:12:40,696 --> 01:12:42,532
两年了
{\fs12}Two years are up.

565
01:13:25,241 --> 01:13:27,374
我知道有些人 在这一刻
{\fs12}I know that some of you, at this very moment,

566
01:13:27,376 --> 01:13:30,142
正在计划逃跑
{\fs12}are thinking about escape.

567
01:13:31,046 --> 01:13:33,280
有胆子就来试试
{\fs12}Feel free to try whenever you like.

568
01:13:33,282 --> 01:13:35,585
我们很乐于向你们开枪
{\fs12}We'll be happy to shoot you.

569
01:13:37,118 --> 01:13:39,652
但如果你们想避免这种下场
{\fs12}However, should you avoid that mercy,

570
01:13:39,654 --> 01:13:43,656
总有两个哨兵在执勤...
{\fs12}there are two guardians who are always on duty.

571
01:13:43,658 --> 01:13:47,326
在丛林里只能挨饿
{\fs12}The bush, where the best thing that can happen to you is starvation.

572
01:13:47,328 --> 01:13:49,829
你也可以选择跳海
{\fs12}Or you could choose the sea,

573
01:13:49,831 --> 01:13:53,133
那里的鲨鱼也总是很饿
{\fs12}where the sharks too, are always hungry.

574
01:13:56,505 --> 01:13:59,705
第一次逃跑未果
{\fs12}If you manage to survive your first attempt,

575
01:13:59,707 --> 01:14:03,477
单独囚禁两年
{\fs12}you'll get two years in solitary.

576
01:14:03,479 --> 01:14:05,812
第二次逃跑未果 单独囚禁五年
{\fs12}Second attempt is five years in solitary,

577
01:14:05,814 --> 01:14:08,414
第三次就是恶魔岛的无期徒刑
{\fs12}followed by a life sentence at Devil's Island.

578
01:14:09,751 --> 01:14:14,088
如果你杀了人
{\fs12}If you commit murder...

579
01:14:14,090 --> 01:14:15,592
你会被处决的
{\fs12}...you'll be executed.

580
01:14:17,626 --> 01:14:19,129
就这样
{\fs12}That's all.

581
01:14:25,468 --> 01:14:26,669
巴比
{\fs12}Papi.

582
01:14:47,255 --> 01:14:49,722
我想早点来的
{\fs12}I wanted to come sooner,

583
01:14:49,724 --> 01:14:52,629
但我担心你不想见我
{\fs12}but I was afraid you wouldn't wanna see me.

584
01:14:59,401 --> 01:15:00,636
对不起
{\fs12}I'm sorry.

585
01:15:01,903 --> 01:15:03,772
你在这里 全是我的错
{\fs12}It's my fault you're here.

586
01:15:10,813 --> 01:15:12,812
正如你预测的
{\fs12}As you predicted, um,

587
01:15:12,814 --> 01:15:14,683
我的上诉遭到了麻烦
{\fs12}my appeal's run into some problems.

588
01:15:16,417 --> 01:15:18,918
但我老婆处理得当
{\fs12}But my wife's doing very well.

589
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:21,790
她最近嫁给了我的律师
{\fs12}She recently married my lawyer.

590
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:30,567
那么 和她一起下地狱吧
{\fs12}Well, to hell with her then.

591
01:15:35,670 --> 01:15:37,370
你这狗娘养的
{\fs12}You son of a bitch.

592
01:15:37,372 --> 01:15:39,808
我还以为你傻了
{\fs12}I thought you'd gone simple on me.

593
01:15:44,212 --> 01:15:46,116
你这么想就对了
{\fs12}That's the idea.

594
01:15:54,622 --> 01:15:56,656
你知道交出我的名字
{\fs12}You know you'd have had a much easier time

595
01:15:56,658 --> 01:15:58,926
你会活得更轻松
{\fs12}if you'd just given them my name.

596
01:15:59,558 --> 01:16:01,698
我考都没有考虑过
{\fs12}It's not like I didn't think about it.

597
01:16:03,898 --> 01:16:06,365
我知道你很脆弱
{\fs12}I just know how goddamn delicate you are.

598
01:16:06,367 --> 01:16:07,567
嗯
{\fs12}Mm.

599
01:16:11,506 --> 01:16:13,906
恐怕换成我
{\fs12}I fear under similar circumstances

600
01:16:13,908 --> 01:16:15,844
我早就交代了
{\fs12}I would've fared differently.

601
01:16:17,612 --> 01:16:19,615
不知道你是怎么做到的
{\fs12}I don't know how you made it.

602
01:16:20,815 --> 01:16:23,519
我习惯了沉默
{\fs12}I just got used to the silence.

603
01:16:25,453 --> 01:16:27,189
如果我能出去
{\fs12}If I ever get out...

604
01:16:28,991 --> 01:16:31,594
我要过一种不同的生活
{\fs12}I'm gonna live a different kind of life.

605
01:16:35,997 --> 01:16:40,400
这个星期日 典狱长将在院子里放电影
{\fs12}This Sunday, the warden will be showing a film in the courtyard,

606
01:16:40,402 --> 01:16:42,735
招待当地政客
{\fs12}entertaining some local politicians.

607
01:16:42,737 --> 01:16:44,437
会很吵的
{\fs12}It'll be loud.

608
01:16:44,439 --> 01:16:47,374
警卫要值两班 岗哨间隔非常远
{\fs12}The guards will be doing double-duty, spread very thin.

609
01:16:47,376 --> 01:16:50,346
这是你最好的机会
{\fs12}This is your best chance.

610
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,414
你能搞到船吗
{\fs12}Can you get a boat?

611
01:16:54,416 --> 01:16:55,618
不
{\fs12}No.

612
01:16:57,553 --> 01:16:58,867
赛利亚呢 他还在吗
{\fs12}What about Celier? Is he still here?

613
01:16:58,892 --> 01:17:01,286
很不幸 他还在
{\fs12}Unfortunately, yes.

614
01:17:03,163 --> 01:17:05,123
只要他还有船
{\fs12}If he can still get a boat...

615
01:17:06,996 --> 01:17:09,295
你的钱够付吗
{\fs12}do you have enough money to pay for it?

616
01:17:09,297 --> 01:17:12,367
可能 他可能会和我们一起走
{\fs12}Well, I might, but then he'd wanna come with us.

617
01:17:13,902 --> 01:17:15,175
我们
{\fs12}Us?

618
01:17:16,871 --> 01:17:17,906
我们
{\fs12}Us.

619
01:17:21,977 --> 01:17:23,313
行
{\fs12}All right.

620
01:17:24,813 --> 01:17:26,516
但我们还是需要一条船
{\fs12}But we still need a boat.

621
01:17:28,349 --> 01:17:29,883
你现在就走
{\fs12}You leave now!

622
01:17:29,885 --> 01:17:31,450
走
{\fs12}Leave!

这个人疯了 - 离开
{\fs12}This man's mad! - Go!

627
01:17:40,461 --> 01:17:42,396

放开他
{\fs12}Let him go!

635

639
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:02,619
给我拿点水来
{\fs12}Bring me some water.

640
01:18:04,319 --> 01:18:05,520
吞下去
{\fs12}Swallow.

641
01:18:09,425 --> 01:18:10,827
没事的
{\fs12}It'll be okay.

642
01:18:25,573 --> 01:18:27,542
熄灯 十分钟后
{\fs12}Lights out, ten minutes.

643
01:18:57,973 --> 01:18:59,472
嘘嘘
{\fs12}Shh, shh.

644
01:18:59,474 --> 01:19:01,475
你离我远点 - 放松
{\fs12}Get off of me. - Just relax!

645
01:19:01,477 --> 01:19:02,609
放开我 - 放松
{\fs12}Leave me! - Relax.

646
01:19:02,611 --> 01:19:04,578

嘘嘘
{\fs12}Shh, shh.

648
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:11,354
你很快会知道下场的
{\fs12}You will soon, if you know what's good for you.

649
01:19:27,870 --> 01:19:29,267
嘿
{\fs12}Hey.

650
01:19:29,604 --> 01:19:31,506
我只想谈谈
{\fs12}Hey, I just wanna talk.

651
01:19:33,908 --> 01:19:36,977
我不是妓女 - 我没想那样
{\fs12}I'm not a goddamn whore. - That's not what I want.

652
01:19:36,979 --> 01:19:38,978
每个人都这么说
{\fs12}Yeah, everybody says that until they do.

653
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:41,580
相信我 我没那个想法
{\fs12}Trust me, I don't.

654
01:19:41,582 --> 01:19:44,551
我有提议
{\fs12}I got a different proposition.

655
01:19:45,116 --> 01:19:48,088
如果你碎碎念 对你没好处
{\fs12}If you repeat one word of this, it's not gonna be good for you.

656
01:19:48,090 --> 01:19:50,460
我不想知道 - 也许你想
{\fs12}I don't wanna know then. - Maybe you do.

657
01:19:52,795 --> 01:19:55,085
我简单说一下
{\fs12}Look, I'm puttin' something together.

658
01:19:55,730 --> 01:19:57,195
这个星期天
{\fs12}This Sunday.

659
01:19:58,333 --> 01:20:00,536
我们还有一个空缺
{\fs12}We got room for one more.

660
01:20:02,203 --> 01:20:04,170
⚔我没有东西给你
{\fs12}I have nothing to offer you.

661
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:07,305
我要你去分散狱吏的注意力
{\fs12}I need you to distract that turnkey.

662
01:20:08,710 --> 01:20:12,512
让他到时候进来 拖住他
{\fs12}Get him to come in here at a certain time, keep him occupied.

663
01:20:13,144 --> 01:20:14,270
如果我做了
{\fs12}If I do that,

664
01:20:15,082 --> 01:20:16,690
你最好计划周详
{\fs12}your plan better work.

665
01:20:17,553 --> 01:20:19,052
会奏效的
{\fs12}It'll work.

666
01:20:19,054 --> 01:20:21,087
可没那么容易
{\fs12}It's not gonna be easy.

667
01:20:21,695 --> 01:20:23,393
你一个人能做到吗
{\fs12}Can you handle yourself?

668
01:20:25,861 --> 01:20:27,697
你是被陷害谋杀的吧
{\fs12}You were framed for murder, right?

669
01:20:30,832 --> 01:20:32,768
没人敢陷害我
{\fs12}Well, nobody framed me.

670
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:40,777
那是赛利亚
{\fs12}That's Celier.

671
01:20:41,943 --> 01:20:43,743
他给我们搞了条船
{\fs12}He's gotten us a boat.

672
01:20:43,745 --> 01:20:45,177
手伸出来
{\fs12}Let's see the arm.

你这个瘦猴子
{\fs12}You skinny son of a bitch.

很高兴见到你
{\fs12}Good to see you.

678
01:20:59,193 --> 01:21:01,227
你把手怎么了
{\fs12}What'd you do to your arm?

679
01:21:01,229 --> 01:21:03,562
我自己割伤的
{\fs12}I had to cut myself to get in here.

680
01:21:03,564 --> 01:21:05,899
这招还有用吗 - 没什么的 别想了
{\fs12}It still work? - Yeah, it's nothing. Don't think about it.

681
01:21:05,901 --> 01:21:09,168
我还能揍死你 - 我快点吗 我得回去了
{\fs12}I can still kick your ass. - Can we hurry this up? I have to get back.

682
01:21:09,170 --> 01:21:11,144
小鸟 你能闭嘴吗
{\fs12}Birdie, can you shut up for once?

683
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:14,106
这是马屈瑞 我们的第四个人
{\fs12}This is Maturette. He's our fourth.

684
01:21:14,789 --> 01:21:15,915

{\fs12}Oh, yeah?

685
01:21:16,979 --> 01:21:19,512
一个人行吗 - 行 用刀子
{\fs12}You know how to handle yourself? - Yeah, with a knife.

686
01:21:19,514 --> 01:21:22,516
好吧 放松点 - 活泼的小个子
{\fs12}All right, take it easy. - Feisty little one, huh?

687
01:21:24,051 --> 01:21:27,553
你们都准备好了吗 - 是 我准备好了
{\fs12}You all set? - Yeah, I'm set.

688
01:21:27,555 --> 01:21:29,755
我有人在岸边藏了一条船
{\fs12}I got a guy that's hiding a boat on the bank.

689
01:21:29,757 --> 01:21:32,292
在河的上游
{\fs12}It's upriver a ways.

690
01:21:32,294 --> 01:21:35,031
从那里可以直接进入大海
{\fs12}From there, it's a straight shot to the ocean.

691
01:21:37,032 --> 01:21:38,935
现在要交一半的钱
{\fs12}But we need half the money now.

692
01:21:41,269 --> 01:21:43,035
你呢
{\fs12}What about you?

693
01:21:43,037 --> 01:21:45,571
电影一开始 我们就穿过典狱长的大楼
{\fs12}When the film starts, we'll go through the warden's building.

694
01:21:45,573 --> 01:21:46,863
我会有钥匙的
{\fs12}I'll have a key.

695
01:21:48,710 --> 01:21:50,033
那就定了
{\fs12}We got a plan.

696
01:21:50,912 --> 01:21:52,180
定了
{\fs12}We got a plan.

697
01:22:00,555 --> 01:22:01,756
你没事吧
{\fs12}You all right?

698
01:22:02,757 --> 01:22:04,257
没事
{\fs12}No.

699
01:22:04,259 --> 01:22:07,033
我们能信任他吗
{\fs12}I'm not sure we can trust him.

700
01:22:07,929 --> 01:22:10,163
这家伙难以预测
{\fs12}Look at him, he's unpredictable.

701
01:22:10,165 --> 01:22:11,798
他就像笼中兽
{\fs12}He's like a caged animal.

702
01:22:12,222 --> 01:22:14,516
我们都是笼中兽 伙计
{\fs12}We're all animals in here, pal.

703
01:22:17,005 --> 01:22:18,241
他会没事的
{\fs12}He'll be fine.

704
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:21,076
他现在需要钱
{\fs12}He needs the money now.

705
01:22:33,988 --> 01:22:35,288
给
{\fs12}Here.

706
01:22:35,995 --> 01:22:38,024
是他们给我的镇静剂
{\fs12}It's the sedatives they gave me.

707
01:22:38,026 --> 01:22:40,360
放进警卫的咖啡里
{\fs12}Get 'em in the guards' coffee.

708
01:22:40,362 --> 01:22:42,098
其他的交给我们
{\fs12}We'll do the rest.

709
01:22:44,232 --> 01:22:46,132
我得回去了
{\fs12}I have to get back.

710
01:22:50,104 --> 01:22:51,806
你干得不错
{\fs12}You're doin' good.

711
01:23:06,354 --> 01:23:08,387
看看这是什么
{\fs12}Hey. - What do we have here, huh?

712
01:23:08,389 --> 01:23:09,825
去死吧
{\fs12}Go to hell.

713
01:23:11,259 --> 01:23:13,660
还给我
{\fs12}Give me those back.

714
01:23:13,662 --> 01:23:14,860
他会搞砸我们的计划的
{\fs12}He's gonna fuck up our plan.

715
01:23:14,862 --> 01:23:16,795
没事的
{\fs12}It's gonna be fine.

716
01:23:18,767 --> 01:23:21,200
你他妈在干什么 伙计
{\fs12}What the fuck are you doing, man?

717
01:23:27,943 --> 01:23:29,743
够了
{\fs12}All right! That's enough!

718
01:23:29,745 --> 01:23:31,747
都给我分开
{\fs12}Break it up! Break it up!

719
01:23:46,327 --> 01:23:48,695
偶尔我也会出上一拳
{\fs12}I had to figure I'd know how to throw a punch

720
01:23:48,697 --> 01:23:51,233
因为我父亲经常打我
{\fs12}considering how often my father used to beat me.

721
01:23:55,737 --> 01:23:56,939
你的也是吗
{\fs12}Yours too?

722
01:23:58,953 --> 01:24:00,955
我父母是老师
{\fs12}My parents are school teachers.

723
01:24:04,779 --> 01:24:06,047
今晚见
{\fs12}See ya tonight.

724
01:24:18,225 --> 01:24:19,640
典狱长要茴香酒
{\fs12}Anisette for the warden.

725
01:24:20,295 --> 01:24:21,663
拿出你最好的
{\fs12}The best you have.

726
01:24:24,562 --> 01:24:26,063
给我一瓶
{\fs12}Just give me the bottle.

727
01:24:43,289 --> 01:24:45,583
<i>金刚</i>

728
01:25:43,099 --> 01:25:45,078
有两三个
{\fs12}Here's two or three.

729
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:47,880
先生们 想醒一醒咖啡吗
{\fs12}Would you gentlemen like your coffees freshened?

730
01:25:47,882 --> 01:25:49,018
拿过来
{\fs12}Bring it on in.

731
01:26:06,201 --> 01:26:08,200
典狱长请客
{\fs12}Compliments of the warden.

732
01:26:10,005 --> 01:26:11,303
很好
{\fs12}Very nice.

733
01:26:17,211 --> 01:26:18,379
拿着
{\fs12}Here.

734
01:26:23,285 --> 01:26:26,455
杀了人就得上断头台
{\fs12}If we kill someone and this goes wrong, it's the guillotine.

735
01:26:27,522 --> 01:26:29,145
所以不要杀人
{\fs12}No one dies.

736
01:26:54,148 --> 01:26:55,949
再给我来一杯
{\fs12}Give me another one of them.

737
01:26:55,951 --> 01:26:57,319
行
{\fs12}All right.

738
01:27:13,635 --> 01:27:14,968
德加
{\fs12}Dega!

739
01:27:14,970 --> 01:27:16,902
你要去哪里
{\fs12}Where are you going?

740
01:27:16,904 --> 01:27:18,204
德加
{\fs12}Dega!

741

742
01:27:55,410 --> 01:27:57,110
别动 嘘 嘘

743
01:27:57,112 --> 01:27:58,244
嘘 嘘
{\fs12}Shh, shh!

744
01:27:58,246 --> 01:27:59,677
什么声音
{\fs12}What was that?

745
01:28:00,986 --> 01:28:02,363
我最好去看看
{\fs12}I'd better go check.

746
01:28:25,473 --> 01:28:27,076
果然有用
{\fs12}It's working.

747
01:28:50,077 --> 01:28:52,065
老兄
{\fs12}Oh, man.

748
01:28:52,067 --> 01:28:53,414
我们来太早了
{\fs12}We're too early.

749
01:28:55,170 --> 01:28:57,469
有打火机吗
{\fs12}Hey, got a light?

750
01:28:57,471 --> 01:28:59,172
当然有 先生
{\fs12}Yes, of course, sir.

751
01:29:09,684 --> 01:29:12,118
大家进去吧

752
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:14,486
所有人都进去吧

{\fs12}That's our way out. - No, no.

755
01:29:27,368 --> 01:29:29,067
他在干什么
{\fs12}What's he doin'?

756
01:29:33,474 --> 01:29:34,774
停电了 - 操
{\fs12}Power's off! - Fuck!

757
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:42,481

{\fs12}Papi, we gotta move. We can't stay here.

758
01:29:43,130 --> 01:29:44,784
我们等德加
{\fs12}We wait for Dega.

759
01:29:44,786 --> 01:29:46,425
忘掉德加吧
{\fs12}Forget about Dega!

760
01:29:47,687 --> 01:29:48,632
他不可靠
{\fs12}He's not reliable.

761
01:29:48,886 --> 01:29:50,137
你知道的
{\fs12}And you know it!

762
01:29:50,457 --> 01:29:51,972
我们走吧 快
{\fs12}Let's just go. Come on.

763

767
01:30:03,304 --> 01:30:04,540
你怎么了
{\fs12}What's wrong with you?

768
01:30:10,444 --> 01:30:14,480
我偷到了钥匙 可以去中央走道
{\fs12}Ha! I stole the keys to get us up to the central walkway.

769
01:30:14,482 --> 01:30:17,049
通向哨塔
{\fs12}We can take that to the guard tower.

770
01:30:17,051 --> 01:30:20,520
只要灯不亮 他们就看不到我们
{\fs12}As long as the lights stay off, they won't see us.

771
01:30:20,522 --> 01:30:21,877
然后跳下去吗
{\fs12}And then we jump?

772
01:30:21,902 --> 01:30:24,029
你有更好的主意吗

777
01:30:48,515 --> 01:30:50,283
你 带我去南墙

779
01:31:10,304 --> 01:31:11,404

{\fs12}Come on!

791
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:07,160
跳 快点
{\fs12}Jump! Come on!

792
01:32:07,162 --> 01:32:08,467
跳
{\fs12}Jump!

793
01:32:11,366 --> 01:32:12,498
妈的
{\fs12}Shit!

794
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:13,732
腿断了
{\fs12}Hey. It's broken.

795
01:32:13,734 --> 01:32:15,767
别管他了 - 钱在他那里
{\fs12}Leave him. - He's got the money.

796
01:32:17,471 --> 01:32:19,186
马屈瑞 帮我
{\fs12}Maturette, help me.

797
01:32:20,175 --> 01:32:21,406
天那
{\fs12}Christ!

798
01:32:21,408 --> 01:32:23,178
好了来吧
{\fs12}All right, come on.

799
01:32:24,746 --> 01:32:25,681
我们走
{\fs12}Let's go.

800
01:32:35,956 --> 01:32:37,325
快
{\fs12}Come on.

801
01:32:42,429 --> 01:32:44,196
船还有多远
{\fs12}How much further to the boat?

802
01:32:44,198 --> 01:32:45,731
你在拖累我们 德加
{\fs12}You're slowing us down, Dega.

803
01:32:45,733 --> 01:32:48,570
快 必须迅速
{\fs12}Come on. We've got to move faster.

804
01:33:15,229 --> 01:33:17,598
再敢走一步
{\fs12}Don't take another step.

805
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:21,335
别把我带回去
{\fs12}You're not takin' me back.

806
01:33:23,266 --> 01:33:25,977
那得看你带没带钱
{\fs12}That depends if you have my money.

807
01:33:32,380 --> 01:33:34,347
巴比 没事的
{\fs12}Papi. It's okay.

808
01:33:34,349 --> 01:33:35,817
这是我的船上的人
{\fs12}This is my guy with the boat.

809
01:33:41,989 --> 01:33:43,455
船在哪
{\fs12}Where's our boat?

810
01:33:43,457 --> 01:33:45,658
在河的上游
{\fs12}It's a ways up the river.

811
01:33:45,660 --> 01:33:48,526
想要去那里 先给钱
{\fs12}Want me to take you there, pay me.

812
01:33:48,528 --> 01:33:49,918
不然就弄死你
{\fs12}Or fuck you.

813
01:34:03,978 --> 01:34:06,248
我就这点钱了
{\fs12}This is all I have left.

814
01:34:11,685 --> 01:34:13,788
不要告诉别人
{\fs12}Let's keep that between us.

815
01:34:35,643 --> 01:34:37,312
享受自由吧
{\fs12}Enjoy your freedom!

816
01:35:24,858 --> 01:35:27,560
这什么破船
{\fs12}Fuck! What kind of shit boat did you get us?

817
01:35:27,562 --> 01:35:29,561
闭嘴 德加
{\fs12}Shut up, Dega!

818
01:35:29,563 --> 01:35:32,030
你能上船就够走运了 继续舀水
{\fs12}You're lucky to be here. Keep bailing!

819
01:35:32,032 --> 01:35:33,732
把水弄出去
{\fs12}Get it outta the boat.

820
01:35:33,734 --> 01:35:35,065
我在努力
{\fs12}I'm trying.

821
01:35:36,037 --> 01:35:38,070
别泼在我身上 德加 该死的
{\fs12}Don't throw it at me, Dega. Goddamn it.

822
01:35:38,072 --> 01:35:39,972
泼到海里去 - 我是泼到海里的
{\fs12}Throw it in the water! - I'm throwing it at the water.

823
01:35:39,974 --> 01:35:41,707
马屈瑞 - 在
{\fs12}Maturette! - Yes?

824
01:35:41,709 --> 01:35:42,611
检查舵柄
{\fs12}Check the tiller.

825
01:35:44,679 --> 01:35:45,947
我来了
{\fs12}I got it, I got it.

826
01:35:50,917 --> 01:35:52,584
巴比
{\fs12}Papi.

827
01:35:52,586 --> 01:35:54,919
这艘船坐不下所有人
{\fs12}This boat can't hold all of us. You know it.

828
01:35:54,921 --> 01:35:56,491
我们要减轻重量
{\fs12}We need to lighten the weight.

829
01:36:03,663 --> 01:36:05,865
反正他会死的 巴比
{\fs12}He's gonna die anyway, Papi.

830
01:36:05,867 --> 01:36:07,665
没人死
{\fs12}Nobody needs to die.

831
01:36:07,667 --> 01:36:09,901
操 掉了
{\fs12}Fuck! It fell off!

832
01:36:09,903 --> 01:36:11,771
去修理舵柄 - 坏了啊
{\fs12}Fix the tiller! - It's broken.

833
01:36:11,773 --> 01:36:13,311
修舵
{\fs12}Fix the tiller!

834
01:36:13,974 --> 01:36:15,607
闪开
{\fs12}Move!

835
01:36:23,584 --> 01:36:24,786
拜托
{\fs12}Come on.

836
01:36:59,554 --> 01:37:02,187
你拿一下
{\fs12}Here, take this. Take this.

837
01:37:02,189 --> 01:37:03,591
马屈瑞 帮我
{\fs12}Maturette, help me.

838
01:37:18,639 --> 01:37:21,073
暴风雨 船会沉的
{\fs12}This storm is gonna sink the boat.

839
01:37:21,075 --> 01:37:23,241
必须立即采取行动
{\fs12}We need to act, and we need to act now.

840
01:37:23,243 --> 01:37:24,779
我要把船备好
{\fs12}Just let me get the boat ready.

841
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:27,983
你是不是疯了
{\fs12}Did you lose your mind? Huh?

842
01:37:29,116 --> 01:37:31,049
你想因为这个家伙而死吗
{\fs12}You wanna die because of this guy?

843
01:37:31,051 --> 01:37:33,121
没有人会死
{\fs12}Nobody needs to die.

844
01:37:37,892 --> 01:37:39,355
我不可能都活着
{\fs12}Well, we can't all live.

845
01:37:40,027 --> 01:37:42,233
德加 他是死沉死沉的
{\fs12}Dega, he's dead weight.

846
01:37:43,568 --> 01:37:45,028
你有多少钱
{\fs12}How much money you have?

847
01:37:47,167 --> 01:37:49,235
他没有钱
{\fs12}He doesn't have any money.

848
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:51,236
他没有钱吗
{\fs12}He doesn't have any money?

849
01:37:51,826 --> 01:37:53,137
你听到了吗 马屈瑞
{\fs12}You hear that, Maturette?

850
01:37:53,870 --> 01:37:55,288
他们一直在骗我们
{\fs12}They've been lying to us.

851
01:37:56,243 --> 01:37:57,711
你想为他而死吗
{\fs12}You wanna die for him?

852
01:38:00,715 --> 01:38:02,213
现在是二对一 巴比
{\fs12}That makes it two against one, Papi.

853
01:38:02,215 --> 01:38:03,781
让开
{\fs12}Step aside.

854
01:38:03,783 --> 01:38:05,651
你什么都不需要做
{\fs12}You don't need to do anything.

855
01:38:05,653 --> 01:38:07,785
让开 巴比
{\fs12}Step aside, Papi!

856
01:38:07,787 --> 01:38:09,410
我不会为那家伙死的
{\fs12}I'm not gonna die for that guy.

857
01:38:10,925 --> 01:38:12,727
最后一次机会 巴比让开
{\fs12}Last chance, Papi. Step aside!

858
01:38:15,262 --> 01:38:17,231
我不了解你 但我要回家了
{\fs12}I don't know about you, I'm going home!

859
01:39:12,053 --> 01:39:13,185
住手
{\fs12}Stop!

860
01:39:13,187 --> 01:39:14,986
住手
{\fs12}Stop!

861
01:39:14,988 --> 01:39:16,857
够了
{\fs12}Enough! That's enough!

862
01:39:18,125 --> 01:39:19,694
够了
{\fs12}That's enough.

863
01:39:22,295 --> 01:39:23,361
够了
{\fs12}Enough.

864
01:41:45,305 --> 01:41:46,840
⚔欢迎
{\fs12}Welcome.

865
01:41:52,212 --> 01:41:54,112
我还有另外两个人
{\fs12}I was traveling with two other men.

866
01:41:54,114 --> 01:41:55,983
他们都在
{\fs12}They are being cared for.

867
01:42:00,987 --> 01:42:02,451
我们在哪
{\fs12}Where are we?

868
01:42:02,857 --> 01:42:04,993
这里是哥伦比亚
{\fs12}This is Colombia.

869
01:42:07,995 --> 01:42:09,667
我们知道你来自哪里
{\fs12}We know where you've come from.

870
01:42:12,899 --> 01:42:15,236
你只需忏悔
{\fs12}But you need only repent.

871
01:42:16,336 --> 01:42:19,773
上帝会重回你的生活
{\fs12}Allow God back into your life...

872
01:42:21,407 --> 01:42:23,444
你会被宽恕的
{\fs12}and you'll be forgiven.

873
01:42:25,813 --> 01:42:27,846
去洗一洗吧
{\fs12}You should go and wash yourself.

874
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:30,646
然后和我们一起祈祷
{\fs12}Then come and pray with us.

875
01:43:53,867 --> 01:43:55,536
我们还得跑
{\fs12}We need to keep movin'.

876
01:44:01,375 --> 01:44:03,144
他们知道我们从哪来的
{\fs12}They know where we came from.

877
01:44:05,946 --> 01:44:08,015
协议履行完成了
{\fs12}Our deal is done.

878
01:44:09,515 --> 01:44:12,252
我说了不能相信他
{\fs12}I told you we couldn't trust him.

879
01:44:16,357 --> 01:44:18,091
我要走了
{\fs12}I'm leaving.

880
01:44:20,961 --> 01:44:22,864
有没有你都要走
{\fs12}With or without you.

881
01:44:41,381 --> 01:44:42,850
祝好运
{\fs12}Good luck.

882
01:44:55,062 --> 01:44:57,228
巴比 我们成功了
{\fs12}Papi! We made it!

883
01:44:57,230 --> 01:44:58,963
巴比
{\fs12}Papi.

884
01:44:58,965 --> 01:45:00,464
这里是天堂
{\fs12}It's paradise here.

885
01:45:00,466 --> 01:45:02,448
是 但这里不是家
{\fs12}Yeah, but it's not home.

886
01:45:04,138 --> 01:45:05,506
反正不是我的
{\fs12}Not for me, anyway.

887
01:45:07,974 --> 01:45:09,309
祝好运 马屈瑞
{\fs12}Good luck, Maturette.

888
01:46:21,614 --> 01:46:23,117
赶快走
{\fs12}We're leaving.

889
01:46:24,283 --> 01:46:25,616
现在
{\fs12}Now.

890
01:46:25,618 --> 01:46:26,548
快
{\fs12}Come on.

891
01:46:29,188 --> 01:46:30,621
啊 巴比
{\fs12}Aah! - Papi!

892
01:46:30,623 --> 01:46:32,225
马屈瑞
{\fs12}Maturette!

893
01:46:42,635 --> 01:46:44,268
忏悔
{\fs12}Repent.

894
01:46:44,270 --> 01:46:46,303
如果你们真的忏悔
{\fs12}If you are truly sorry for what you have done,

895
01:46:46,305 --> 01:46:48,073
那就没什么可怕的
{\fs12}then you have nothing to fear.

896
01:46:48,075 --> 01:46:50,044
上帝会照顾你的
{\fs12}God will watch over you.

897
01:46:58,152 --> 01:46:59,687
你又回来了
{\fs12}You came back.

898
01:47:34,121 --> 01:47:35,556
来吧巴比
{\fs12}Come on, Papi.

899
01:48:01,782 --> 01:48:04,085
我得亲自来看看
{\fs12}I had to come and see this for myself.

900
01:48:05,519 --> 01:48:07,755
单独关押五年 很少人能活下来
{\fs12}Few men survive five years in solitary.

901
01:48:15,629 --> 01:48:17,398
你活着是为了什么
{\fs12}What were you living for?

902
01:48:20,399 --> 01:48:22,769
因为你绝不会料到你会去...
{\fs12}'Cause I don't think you're gonna find it where you're going...

903
01:48:26,540 --> 01:48:28,109
恶魔岛
{\fs12}Devil's Island.

904
01:50:34,934 --> 01:50:39,239
现在 为人师表的儿子怎么会在这种地方
{\fs12}Now, what's the son of two school teachers doing in a place like this?

905
01:51:17,778 --> 01:51:18,946
那么
{\fs12}Well?

906
01:51:20,781 --> 01:51:21,982
你觉得怎么样
{\fs12}What do you think?

907
01:51:25,852 --> 01:51:27,822
我用了五年的时间画的
{\fs12}I've had five years to work on it.

908
01:51:29,523 --> 01:51:33,391
典狱长对我的反抗不满意
{\fs12}The warden wasn't very happy with my disobedience.

909
01:51:33,393 --> 01:51:36,994
所以他把我直送恶魔岛
{\fs12}So he sent me straight here to Devil's Island.

910
01:51:52,446 --> 01:51:54,482
来吃点东西吧
{\fs12}Let's get some food in you.

911
01:52:11,497 --> 01:52:13,000
太阳照屁股了
{\fs12}Rise and shine.

912
01:52:15,635 --> 01:52:16,570
来吧
{\fs12}Come on.

913
01:52:17,804 --> 01:52:19,907
有活儿要干
{\fs12}There's work to be done.

914
01:53:31,545 --> 01:53:33,413
我们能去海边吗
{\fs12}Can we get to the ocean?

915
01:53:43,189 --> 01:53:44,759
我知道你在想什么
{\fs12}I know what you're thinking.

916
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:49,397
就算你掉下去没死
{\fs12}But even if you survive the fall...

917
01:53:51,531 --> 01:53:53,434
在海里你也活不了
{\fs12}you'll never survive the ocean.

918
01:55:08,908 --> 01:55:10,975
都是海浪
{\fs12}It's all about the waves.

919
01:55:10,977 --> 01:55:12,031
什么
{\fs12}What?

920
01:55:12,912 --> 01:55:14,712
你在说什么
{\fs12}What are you talking about?

921
01:55:14,714 --> 01:55:17,115
你以为我在说什么
{\fs12}What do you think I'm talkin' about?

922
01:55:17,620 --> 01:55:18,917
回去睡觉吧
{\fs12}Oh, go back to bed.

923
01:55:18,919 --> 01:55:20,317
那是自杀不是逃跑
{\fs12}That's suicide, not escape.

924
01:55:20,319 --> 01:55:21,958
不 听我说
