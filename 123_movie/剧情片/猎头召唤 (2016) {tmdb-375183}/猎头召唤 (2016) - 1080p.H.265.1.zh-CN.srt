My name is Roger Brown. I am 1.68 m.

14
00:01:45,87 --> 00:01:50,58
说我心里不平衡吧，要做些补偿
You do not need a psychologist to understand that it must be compensated.

It has been a tedious process to find out the truth.

20
00:02:15,33 --> 00:02:19,58
像我这样的人如果说还缺什么，也只有一样：
If like me someone wants to get what he wants, there is only one thing:

21
00:02:19,58 --> 00:02:24,83
钱 很多很多的钱
Money. A lot of money.

22
00:02:30,25 --> 00:02:35,29
可是戴安娜认为 还有一样比什么都重要
But there is one thing Diana wants more than anything else.

23
00:02:35,29 --> 00:02:41,37
而那却是我唯一不想给她的东西
And that's just the thing I do not want to give her.

24
00:02:41,54 --> 00:02:46,29

On of those accustomed to love. Those who take it for granted.

00:02:59,00 --> 00:03:03,41
很多男人都会愿意为她付出 尤其那些身高超过 168的人
And lots of men want to give her that. Men who are taller than 1.68.

28
00:03:08,54 --> 00:03:14,16
然而是我追求到她 因为我会把握机会
But soon it's my turn. My opportunity. I can feel it.

29
00:03:14,33 --> 00:03:21,45
于此同时，我也去玩 因为不能放松玩乐的人，不会成功
In the meantime, I play loud. For he who does not play, will not win.

你知道如何监赏艺品的价值吗？
Can you see what it's worth just by looking at it?

53
00:05:14,08 --> 00:05:18,58
那只是一些简单着色，单调的圆形和线条
This consists of circles and lines. Monotone coloring, without texture.

54
00:05:18,58 --> 00:05:25,20
之所以价值 25万，是艺术家的名字

00:06:26,91 --> 00:06:32,33
我保证你在两年内 就会找到五倍于现有收入的工作

69
00:06:32,50 --> 00:06:35,37
你要怎么保证？

70
00:06:35,37 --> 00:06:42,08
因为我从来没有给过客户，任何没有价值的意见

- 那疤痕是哪来的？ - 玻利维亚

251
00:24:18,16 --> 00:24:22,79

- Were you tortured? - No, I was released on time.

252
00:24:22,79 --> 00:24:28,99
- 听起来像一部电影 - 不，这是真实情节
- Sounds like something from a movie. - No, you have not seen the movie.

253
00:24:29,16 --> 00:24:32,87
- 我们什么时候能跟‘探路者’开会？ - 任何时候！
- When can we have a meeting with Pathfinder? - Anytime.

254
00:24:32,87 --> 00:24:35,79
- 你什么时候回来？ - 后天
- When are you back? - The day after tomorrow.

255
00:24:35,79 --> 00:24:38,79
那好，就后天
So we take it then.

256
00:24:42,00 --> 00:24:44,58
戴安娜？
Diana?

257
00:29:59,29 --> 00:30:05,49
嗨，我是戴安娜，我现在不能接听电话 祝你有愉快的一天
Hey, it's Diana. I can not answer the phone now. Have a nice day.

258
00:31:01,00 --> 00:31:04,83
- 哈罗 - 终于回来啦
- Hello. - So there you are.

259
00:31:04,83 --> 00:31:09,49
- 我有打你的手机 没通 - 我一定是忘在画廊了
- I tried to call you on your mobile. - I must have forgotten it at the gallery.

260
00:31:11,08 --> 00:31:14,95
- 有重要的事吗？ - 没
- Was it something important? - No.

261
00:31:17,16 --> 00:31:19,91
只是想听听你的声音
I just wanted to hear your voice.

262
00:31:20,08 --> 00:31:24,83
你很可爱 快来坐下，电影才刚刚开始
You are cute. Come and sit down, a movie has just started.

263
00:31:25,41 --> 00:31:28,91
不，我...
No. I ...

264
00:31:29,87 --> 00:31:33,91
我累坏了 我要去睡觉
I am totally exhausted. I'll go to bed.

265
00:31:33,91 --> 00:31:36,99
好吧
Ok.

266
00:31:41,70 --> 00:31:46,29
我们开发了一种发胶，一小撮里就有上百个发报器
We developed a gel that contains hundreds of transmitters per ml.

267
00:31:46,29 --> 00:31:49,49
能附着任何物体，绝对不会脱落
It sticks to everything, and is impossible to remove.

268
00:31:49,50 --> 00:31:51,66
这样就能追踪
You mean Trace.

269
00:31:51,66 --> 00:31:56,95
缺点是，沾上污泥会干扰它
The weakness is that Trace is sensitive to mud, for example.

270
00:31:56,95 --> 00:32:00,16
这是我从军时的经验
This I know from experience as a soldier.

271
00:32:00,16 --> 00:32:03,49
当你处在他妈的，对不起，险恶的环境里...
When you are in, excuse me, the world's butt hole ...

272
00:32:03,66 --> 00:32:06,83
可信赖的设备会救你一命
When you are dependent on equipment that works.

273
00:32:10,87 --> 00:32:15,54
还好您请罗杰布朗来帮忙，否则我们可能不会碰面
That you are using Brown, is clearly of great importance.

274
00:32:15,54 --> 00:32:21,24
归根结底，还由他来介绍我这个人比较好
Ultimately, it is he that must make his recommendation.

275
00:32:21,41 --> 00:32:23,79
抱歉，我失陪一下
For a moment, only.

276
00:32:41,20 --> 00:32:45,66
- 非常好 - 谢谢您！
- Very good. - Thank you.

277
00:32:47,25 --> 00:32:49,83
你何时会写我的介绍信？
When are you writing your recommendation?

278
00:32:49,83 --> 00:32:53,74
- 我们必须考虑一下 - 你说什么？
- We must make a decision first. - What do you say?

279
00:32:53,75 --> 00:33:00,33
有好几个候选人 我们必须看到大局 你会收到通知的
There are several candidates. We must see the overall picture. You will be notified.

280
00:33:00,33 --> 00:33:04,70
你不是和我们一起开会？它不能更好了
Have we been at the same meeting? It could not have gone better.

281
00:33:04,87 --> 00:33:10,45
- 他们几乎都要在合约上签字了 - 真这样就好
- They were ready to sign the contract. - Then you are well too.

282
00:33:17,20 --> 00:33:21,45
嗨！你今晚就去哥德堡，奥雅纳
Hello. You travel to Gothenburg tonight, Ove.

283
00:33:21,45 --> 00:33:27,16
那张画必须尽早脱手
The picture will be sold as soon as possible.

284
00:33:42,16 --> 00:33:45,62
嗨！我要和你谈谈
Hello. I need to talk to you.

285
00:33:45,79 --> 00:33:49,45
- 你不能找我 - 你就不能给我几分钟？
- You can not find me. - Can't you give me two seconds?

286
00:34:04,70 --> 00:34:10,91
对不起，你会这样，都是我的错，但我们已经...
I am sorry if it's my fault that you have it so, but we have ...

287
00:34:10,91 --> 00:34:15,70
我们之间真的没啥好谈的
There really is nothing more to talk about.

288
00:34:16,20 --> 00:34:22,83
- 你需要钱吗？ - 我好想念你
- Do you need money? - I miss you so much.

289
00:34:25,16 --> 00:34:27,04
罗悌 ...
Lotte ...

290
00:34:27,66 --> 00:34:31,70
罗悌 ...不要再与我联络了
Lotte ... Do not contact me again.

291
00:34:49,00 --> 00:34:52,95
- 你看来累坏了 - 谢谢
- You look tired. - Thank you.

292
00:34:55,79 --> 00:34:59,91

298

299

515
01:29:24,04 --> 01:29:27,83
这到底是怎么回事，罗杰？
What the hell is going on here, Roger?

516
01:29:27,83 --> 01:29:34,04
想湮灭证据吗？你认为你可以这样脱身吗？
Removing evidence? Do you think you can get away with this?

517
01:29:37,79 --> 01:29:40,08
搞什么？
What the hell?

518
01:29:43,79 --> 01:29:48,70
原来你把头发都剃了？发报机在上头说
So you did it with the hair? That's where the transmitters were.

519
01:29:49,00 --> 01:29:52,08
这是罗悌干的...
That it was Lotte, who ...

520
01:29:53,08 --> 01:29:56,54
- 你为了这个杀了她？ - 你会伤心吗？
- That's why you killed her? - Does it feel like a loss?

521
01:29:56,70 --> 01:29:58,83
我给你一个选择
I give you a choice.

522
01:29:59,00 --> 01:30:03,74
告诉你是怎么回事，你是想要头部中弹
Tells you what is going on, and you will get a shot in the head.

523
01:30:03,75 --> 01:30:08,20
- 还是，你比较想要腹部中弹 - 你有没有人性？
- Otherwise, you get a bullet in the stomach. - Have you no feelings about it?

524
01:30:08,37 --> 01:30:12,08
我想知道你这样的人 活着有什么意思？
I want to know what people like you really are.

525
01:30:12,08 --> 01:30:14,62
我这样的人？
Like me?

526
01:30:14,62 --> 01:30:19,54
没法爱人的人 没办法将心比心的人
People who can not love. Who are without empathy.

527
01:30:19,70 --> 01:30:22,99
- 将心比心？ - 没错
- Empathy? - Yes.

528
01:30:23,16 --> 01:30:27,41
如果你想知道答案，自己照照镜子
If you want an answer to it, look in the mirror.

529
01:30:27,41 --> 01:30:30,62
- 我才不像你 - 你不像吗？
- I am not like you. - Aren't you?

530
01:30:30,62 --> 01:30:32,99
不像
No.

531
01:30:33,00 --> 01:30:38,04
- 我有深爱的人 - 你有深爱的人？ 戴安娜？
- I have loved someone. - You have loved someone? Diana?

532
01:30:38,54 --> 01:30:41,62
你爱她吗？
Her you loved?

533
01:30:42,45 --> 01:30:45,33
恐怕我有噩耗要告诉你
I'm afraid I have sad news.

534
01:30:53,45 --> 01:30:58,91
她说，她渴望我 她需要我
She says she longs for me. She wants me.

535
01:31:00,62 --> 01:31:03,08
我也只是凡人
And I'm only human.

536
01:31:03,25 --> 01:31:07,87
你真的爱她吗？比爱你那条死狗还爱？
Have you loved someone? Someone other than your dead dog?

537
01:31:10,04 --> 01:31:14,83
我没空说闲话了 我跟戴安娜今晚还有约
I don't have time for this. I have an appointment with Diana tonight.

538
01:31:15,00 --> 01:31:19,20
你剃了你的头发 你知道我会来找你 为什么呢？
You got your hair. You know I will come after you. Why?

539
01:31:19,37 --> 01:31:23,62
腹部中弹而死需要很长的时间，你会求我给你一个痛快
It takes a long time to die of a stomach shot. You will beg me to kill you.

540
01:31:23,62 --> 01:31:26,99
所以我问你最后一次：我为什么来这里？
So I ask you one last time: Why am I here?

541
01:31:27,00 --> 01:31:30,37
你在笑什么？我为什么来这里？
Why are you smiling? Why am I here?

542
01:31:30,91 --> 01:31:33,49
不准动！
Stop that!

543
01:31:50,00 --> 01:31:54,08
你知道为什么我笑了吗，柯乐斯？
Do you know why I smiled, Clas?

544
01:31:54,33 --> 01:31:58,20
因为你刚刚证明了，戴安娜爱的是我
Because you just proved that Diana loves me.

545
01:31:58,20 --> 01:32:02,24
她去找你，并非因为她想你
She did not come to you because she wanted you.

546
01:32:02,25 --> 01:32:07,33
她是去掉包你的手枪子弹
She came to replace bullets in your gun.

547
01:32:07,33 --> 01:32:11,70
她是拿空包弹 去掉包你的手枪子弹
She has replaced the bullets in your gun. With loose shots.

548
01:32:12,37 --> 01:32:16,24
你们丹麦语怎么说？空白子弹？
Or what do you call them in Denmark? Blanks?

549
01:32:16,41 --> 01:32:20,54
- 你他妈的在说什么？ - 她恨你
- What the hell are you talking about? - She hates you.

550
01:32:21,62 --> 01:32:24,70
她希望你死
She wants you to die.

551
01:32:29,70 --> 01:32:32,79
但是，我给你一个机会
But I'll give you one chance.

552
01:32:35,91 --> 01:32:39,87
我不知道戴安娜掉包了多少子弹
I have no idea how many bullets Diana managed to replace.

553
01:32:44,04 --> 01:32:46,91
这不像你，柯乐斯 ...
It is not like you, Clas ...

554
01:33:54,25 --> 01:33:57,33
结束了吗？
Is it over?

555
01:34:00,45 --> 01:34:02,74
是的
Yes.

556
01:34:15,79 --> 01:34:20,74
我可能不够了解自己，但对人性 我了若指掌
I may not know myself, but others. I will gamble on that.

557
01:34:21,04 --> 01:34:27,87
这场新闻发表会 是由奥斯陆警方和调查局所招开
Welcome to this press conference under the auspices of the Oslo police and NCIS.

558
01:34:28,91 --> 01:34:31,70
我自己已经准备妥当
I had prepared myself well.

559
01:34:31,70 --> 01:34:36,99
我在车祸现场拿的警用手枪，警方在奥雅纳床头柜上找到
Service pistol from the crash which the Police find in Kjikerud's bedside table.

560
01:34:37,00 --> 01:34:43,29
同一把枪打死了罗悌马德森，媒体说她是格雷夫的情妇
The same gun killed Lotte Madsen, which the press called Greve's mistress.

561
01:34:43,45 --> 01:34:51,24
至于“艺品大盗”奥雅纳 和柯乐斯格雷夫是如何杀死对方 ...
How "art thieves" Ove Kjikerud and Clas Greve killed each other ...

562
01:34:51,41 --> 01:34:55,99
全世界的人在网路上都看得到
The whole world has seen on the internet.

563
01:34:58,95 --> 01:35:02,16
而他们也发现格雷夫发射的枪
They would also learn the gun Greve fired, -

564
01:35:02,16 --> 01:35:05,99
弹道和贯穿奥雅纳头的子弹是一致的
- Is consistent with the bullet that perforated Ove's head.

565
01:35:06,00 --> 01:35:09,12
他当初不应该拿那把枪的
He should have never taken the gun.

566
01:35:09,29 --> 01:35:12,37
案情的进展 可谓大有突破
We can present a breakthrough in the case.

567
01:35:12,54 --> 01:35:17,83
我做的一切都天衣无缝 但有一件事我没法改变
I had done everything right. But one thing I could not change.

568
01:35:17,83 --> 01:35:20,95
我射杀格雷夫时，奥雅纳早就死了
Ove was already dead when I shot Greve.

569
01:35:22,20 --> 01:35:25,58
但是布雷德是全挪威最著名的神探
But Brede Sperre is Norway's most famous detective.

570
01:35:25,75 --> 01:35:31,04
无法侦破的悬案不是他的风格 特别是在媒体都这样称呼他的时候：
Unresolved issues are not his style. Especially not after VG called him:

571
01:35:31,04 --> 01:35:34,24
“这名男子让挪威人夜里安心入睡 ”
"The man who makes Norway sleep soundly at night. "

572
01:35:34,25 --> 01:35:37,70
就因为他是神探？当然是罗
Because he's good? Absolutely.

573
01:35:37,70 --> 01:35:44,04
但是他要是真想搞清楚 整件事的来龙去脉怎么办呢？
But mostly because he understood what leads to upward and forward. And what is it?

574
01:35:44,04 --> 01:35:47,04
这真是一个漫长而复杂的调查
It has been a long and complicated investigation.

575
01:35:47,04 --> 01:35:49,37
关键在于‘作者的名字’
The answer begins with "r".

576
01:35:49,37 --> 01:35:52,83
人的声誉啊
Reputation.

577
01:35:52,83 --> 01:35:57,70
让一个人上电视，花痴女主播问他两句话他就飘到天上去了
Get one on TV, and receive text messages from strange women.

578
01:35:57,70 --> 01:36:02,45
我们认为，嫌犯本来是要庆祝窃案得手，结果场面完全失控
We think they celebrated the theft, and it went completely out of control.

579
01:36:02,45 --> 01:36:10,62
他们进而虐杀了狗，杀了无辜农民
Eventually they torture a dog, and kill the farmer.

580
01:36:10,79 --> 01:36:12,83
完全正确
That is correct.

581
01:36:17,50 --> 01:36:20,99
有个愉快的一天 你们俩个
Have a nice day. Both of you.

582
01:36:25,12 --> 01:36:28,58
- 我们已经准备好 - 告诉候选人 再一分钟出来
- We are ready. - Tell the candidate about a minute.

583
01:36:28,58 --> 01:36:31,33
费迪南德 ...谢谢你
Ferdinand ... Thank you.

584
01:36:33,20 --> 01:36:38,74
您好！我们深表歉意 请就座
Hello. We're sorry. Please be seated.

585
01:36:38,91 --> 01:36:42,12
我邀请你们到这里来，是因为我们已到了最后阶段
I have asked you to come here because we are in the final phase of-

586
01:36:42,12 --> 01:36:47,62
探路者的新经理职位经过漫长和戏剧性的寻觅
- A long and dramatic hunting for Pathfinder's new boss.

587
01:36:47,79 --> 01:36:50,99
最近对方才不太情愿的离开他的现职
Most recently it was unrealistic to have him relieved of his position.

588
01:36:51,20 --> 01:36:55,08
我没承诺他很多，我想我已经争取到他加入了
Without promising too much, I think I've got him on the plain.

589
01:36:55,66 --> 01:37:00,12
让我为您介绍 ... 耶利米兰德 先生
Please welcome ... Jeremiah Lander.

590
01:37:00,29 --> 01:37:02,95
上次很感谢你
Thank you for last time.

591
01:37:03,79 --> 01:37:08,29
我叫罗杰布朗，身高只有168公分
My name is Roger Brown. I am 1.68.

592
01:37:08,29 --> 01:37:12,49
而你知道吗？这已经是绰绰有余了
And you know what? That is more than enough.

593
01:37:14,29 --> 01:37:24,49
字幕： Circle did it for Joan

594
