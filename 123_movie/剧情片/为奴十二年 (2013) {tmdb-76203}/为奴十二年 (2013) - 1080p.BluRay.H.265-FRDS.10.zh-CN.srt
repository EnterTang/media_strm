亲爱的 这很赚钱
Darling, it's good money.

56
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,572
要是我能独享你的厨技该多好
If only I didn't have to share your cooking with other people.

57
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,996

You don't.

准备好了吗?
Ready?

63
00:08:47,246 --> 00:08:49,087
说曹操 曹操就到
Devil call his name, there he is now.

64
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,455
诺瑟普先生!
Mr. Northup!

65
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,332
这两位先生您或许愿意认识一下
I have two gentlemen whose acquaintance you should make.

66
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,493
布朗先生和汉密尔顿先生
Misters Brown and Hamilton.

67
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,786
您好
Sir.

68
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,796
诺瑟普先生 这两位先生...
Mr. Northup, these two gentlemen...

69
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,378
在打听杰出人士...
were inquiring about distinguished individuals...

70
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,214
我刚才正说到...
and I was just this very moment...

71
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,550
所罗门・诺瑟普是一位专家级的小提琴演奏者
saying Solomon Northup is an expert player on the violin.

72
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:07,885
正说到您呢
He was indeed.

73
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,132
摩恩先生心地真好
Mr. Moon is being overly gracious.

74
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,676
既然他心地这么好
Well, taking into consideration

75
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,222
您又如此谦逊...
his graciousness and your modesty...

76
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,389
我们能耽误您一会儿跟您聊聊吗 先生?
may we trouble you for a moment of your time to converse, sir?

77
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,807
没问题
Of course.

78
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,349
祝好
Good day.

79
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,980
马戏团?
A circus?

80
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,286
那是我们的常规人员
That is our usual employee.

81
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,858
大家目前在华盛顿城内
The company currently in the city of Washington.

82
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,739
用马戏团这个字眼来描述...
Circus is too constricting a word...

83
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,401
与我们同行的那些奇人异士未免有些不全面
to describe the talented and merry band with which we travel.

84
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,491
应该说是一个举世未见的奇观
It is a spectacle unlike most have ever witnessed.

85
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,326
来自非洲大地最黑暗角落的生灵
Creatures from the darkest Africa

86
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,074
尚未有文明人亲眼见证
as yet unseen by civilized man.

87
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,662
来自遥远东方的杂技演员...
Acrobats from the Orient...

88
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,845
能将身躯扭曲到最不可思议的地步
who contort themselves in the most confounding manners.

89
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,872
还有在变戏法界...
And I myself in aide of Mr. Brown...

90
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,712
全球享有胜名的表演家布朗先生
an internationally renowned practitioner

91
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,550
以及身为他助理的我
in the art of prestidigitation.

92
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,086
我们这一小段时间离开大家伙儿
We are on our way thither to rejoin

93
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,588
藉由自己的展出赚了一小笔...
the company having left for a short time...

94
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,882
现在正回去和大家重聚
to make a small profit from our own exhibitions.

95
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,728
我们向摩恩先生打听是因为...
The reason for our inquiry with Mr. Moon...

96
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:53,635
对了 我们为演出寻觅优质的音乐
Yes. We had just a devil of a time

97
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,512
着实费了一番脑筋
in procuring music for our entertainments.

98
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,680
真正有天赋的人看来太稀缺啦
Men of true talents are seemingly in short supply.

99
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:58,848
谢谢夸奖 先生
Thank you, sir.

100
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,939
要是我们能说服您与我们一同去华盛顿...
If we could persuade you to accompany us as far as Washington...

101
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,525
我们可以付您一天一美元...
We could give you one dollar for each day's services...

102
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,087
而在我们的演出中表演每晚是三美元
and three dollars for every night played at our performances.

103
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,084
另外 我们会为您提供足够的路费...
In addition, we would provide sufficient pay...

104
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,204
让您两周后回到萨拉托加
for your return here to Saratoga, two weeks from today.

105
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,620
欢迎来到华盛顿 所罗门
Welcome to Washington, Solomon.

106
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,429
汉密尔顿 你懂得真多
Hamilton, you know too much.

107
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,089
还有人说不够呢
Some say not enough.

108
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:34,973
所罗门 43美元 都是你的了
Solomon, 43 dollars. All to you.

109
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,062
这可比我的工资多得多了
That is far more than my wages amount to.

110
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,768
这周赚得盆满钵满 先生
It's been a most profitable week, sir.

111
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,225
- 干杯  - 干杯
- Cheers.  - Cheers.

112
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,608
干杯
Cheers.

113
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,732
再来一杯
Another.

114
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:55,281
先生们 你们真是太慷慨了
Gentlemen, your generosity is extraordinary.

115
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,494
而您的才华也是无可否认的
And your talents are undeniable.

116
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,704
嗯 敬所罗门
Mmm. To Solomon.

117
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,370
干杯
Cheers.

118
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,620
啊!
Ugh!

119
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,665
没事的 所罗门
It's all right, Solomon.

120
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:47,957
没什么好丢脸的
There's no shame in it.

121
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,546
根本没必要
No shame at all.

122
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,517
汉密尔顿 咱们得加快速度了
Hamilton, we must hurry.

123
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,460
把人灌个烂醉
One too many libation.

124
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,836
我们就成功一半了
We're halfway there.

125
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,104
真抱歉...
So sorry...

126
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,140
我们听不到的
We won't hear it. We won't.

127
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,318
让他睡吧 汉密尔顿
Let him sleep, Hamilton.

128
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,892
嗯 好好休息一晚上
Mmm. A good night's rest.

129
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,147
到了明天...
And tomorrow...

130
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:48,522
明天你就焕然一新
tomorrow you will feel as well and refreshed

131
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,896
如同外面的世界天翻地覆一般
as if the earth were new again.

132
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:53,815
汉密尔顿 我们什么也帮不到他了
Hamilton, there's nothing more we can do for him.

133
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,001
这便是可悲之处
Such is the pity.

134
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,331
小子 现在什么感觉?
Well, boy, how do you feel now?

135
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:15,591
我... 我叫所罗门・诺瑟普
My name... My name is Solomon Northup.

136
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:19,007
我是一个自由人 是纽约萨拉托加的居民
I'm a free man. A resident of Saratoga, New York.

137
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,801
我妻子和孩子也住那里 他们也是自由人
The residence of my wife and children who are equally free.

138
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,845
无论如何 你们无权扣留我
And you have no right whatsoever to detain me.

139
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,389
你不是个自由人
You're not any free man.

140
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:26,852
我告诉你...
And I promise you...

141
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,188
一旦恢复自由身
I promise you upon my liberation

142
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,482
我一定要得到公正
I will have satisfaction for this wrong.

143
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,614
你倒是试试啊
Resolve this.

144
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,570
拿出文件来
Produce your papers.

145
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,242
你才不是什么自由人
You're no free man.

146
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,832
你也不是萨拉托加的
And you ain't from Saratoga.

147
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,247
你是佐治亚的
You're from Georgia.

148
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,503
你不是个自由人
You ain't a free man.

149
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:02,388
你不过是个从佐治亚逃跑的
You're nothing but a Georgia runaway.

150
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:09,100
你不过是个从佐治亚逃跑的...
You're just a runaway nigger...

151
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,517
黑鬼
from Georgia.

152
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,472
你是个奴隶!
You're a slave!

153
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,612
你是个佐治亚的奴隶!
You're a Georgia slave!

154
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,035
你是奴隶吗?
Are you a slave?

155
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,495
不是
No.

156
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,051
救命
Help.

157
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,020
救我
Help me.

158
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,186
救救我!
Help me!

159
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,227
来人啊!
Somebody help me!

160
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,063
救命!
Help!

161
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,358
救命!
Help!

162
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,876
你身上那件已经是破烂了
That old thing of yours is just rags and tatters.

163
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,508
你得穿得像样点
You need something proper to wear.

164
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,884
穿上吧
Go on, put it on.

165
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,576
这就对了
There.

166
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,326
看起来好多了
That's fine.

167
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,704
好多了
That's fine.

168
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,078
都不怀感激之情?
Got no gratitude?

169
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,501
别拿走 那是我妻子送我的
No. That's from my wife.

170
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,215
不过是一堆破烂
Rags and tatters.

171
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,884
一堆破烂而已
Rags and tatters.

172
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,642
去啊 洗干净
Go on, wash up.

173
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,363
还有这个男孩子 把他也洗干净
The boy, too. Get him clean.

174
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,401
快搓
Scrub now.

175
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,741
你知道我妈妈什么时候会来吗?
Do you know when my mama will come?

176
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,296
让他闭嘴!
Hush him up!

177
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,322
妈妈! 妈妈!
Mama! Mama!

178
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,490
安静点
Quiet.

179
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,125
- 安静点  - 妈妈!
- Quiet, please.  - Mama!

180
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,410
让他闭嘴!
Hush him up!

181
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,956
你妈妈会来的 我发誓她一定会来的 但你现在一定不能出声
Your mother will come, I swear she will. But you must be silent.

182
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,007
别出声
Be silent.

183
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,607
我们需要一个有同情心的倾听者
We need a sympathetic ear.

184
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,469
一个讲清楚我们处境的机会
An opportunity to explain our situation.

185
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,637
那你倒是说说 谁会是那个有同情心的倾听者呢?
Who, in your estimation, is that sympathetic ear?

186
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,522
与我同行的那两个
The two men I journeyed with.

187
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,558
我敢肯定他们此时此刻正展开调查
I'm certain they're making enquiries at this very moment.

188
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,068
我倒是很肯定他们这时候
I'd be just as certain they're counting

189
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,527
正数着把你卖到这儿来赚的钞票呢
the money paid for delivering you to this place.

190
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:26,735
他们不是绑匪 他们是艺术家 一同表演的人
They were not kidnappers, they were artists. Fellow performers.

191
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,365
你确定吗?
You know that?

192
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,526
你确定这是他们的真实身份吗?
You know for certain who they were?

193
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:36,370
现实的结果是我们被向南转移了
The reality to come is us being transported southward.

194
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,626
我敢猜是新奥尔良
New Orleans, if I was to venture.

195
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,746
我们抵达之后 便会被带到市场
After we arrive, we'll be put to market.

196
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,539
然后嘛...
And beyond that...

197
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,935
我想既然沦为奴隶 也就没什么别的结果了吧
Well, I suppose once in a slave state, there's only one outcome.

198
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:47,714
不
No.

199
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,877
约翰 我这么说不是为了让你发无名火的
I don't say that to give you empty agitation, John.

200
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,631
对于你们来说是这样
For y'all, there ain't nothing but that.

201
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,265
但我可不是被绑架的
But John wasn't kidnapped.

202
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,847
我是被用来抵债的 仅此而已
John's just being held as debt, that's all.

203
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,933
主人还清他的债务我就得救了
Master pay his debt and John be redeemed.

204
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,575
小子 我们的主人不会来救我们的
Boy, our masters will not come for us.

205
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:01,724
我为大家感到抱歉 但事实如此
John is sorry for y'all, but that's how it be.

206
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,734
不管你们去哪儿 都没我的事
Where you're going, you're going without John.

207
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,113
- 妈妈  - 兰德尔!
- Mama!  - Randall!

208
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:09,858
妈妈!
Mama!

209
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,407
你还好吗?
Are you all right?

210
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,450
你还好吗?
Are you all right?

211
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,703
谢天谢地
Thank you, God.

212
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,411
来 起床了
Come on. Get up.

213
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,292
- 我说了 起来了!  - 不 别...
- I said, get up!  - No, don't...

214
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,378
我不想听你废话! 到院子里去
I don't want to hear you talk! Get in the yard.

215
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,587
别对我孩子这样!
Not my children!

216
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,095
一惊一乍什么 只是次短途旅行而已
Ain't no need for all that. Just taking a little trip, that's all.

217
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,347
坐在船上的时候
Don't want to frighten the children

218
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,091
可不想吓着孩子吧?
over a little boat ride, do you?

219
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,930
我的主人会还清债务的
John's master gonna pay his debt.

220
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,094
排好队!
Line up!

221
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,445
我的主人会还清债务的!
His master gonna pay his debt!

222
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,941
你们连个屁都不许放!
I don't want to hear a word out of none of you!

223
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,281
一个也不行
Not a one.

224
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:04,879
好了 走吧
All right, come on.

225
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,291
走吧
Move. Come on.

226
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,377
孩子 来 走吧
Come on, child. Come on.

227
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,046
跟着你妈妈
Follow your mama.

228
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,271
来吧 孩子
Come on, boy.

229
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,356
上台阶
Up these stairs.

230
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,634
从马车上下来
Get down out of that wagon. Come on.

231
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:19,636
走吧 动作快!
Come on. Move it!

232
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,479
走吧!
Let's go!

233
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,980
往上 上台阶
Up, up, up the stairs.

234
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,770
走吧
Come on, let's go.

235
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,773
动作快点!
Come on, move it!

236
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,691
好了 接着走
All right, come on.

237
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,741
嘿 你 起来
Hey, you. Get up.

238
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,822
在这儿坐下
Sit down, right there.

239
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,166
来
Come on.

240
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,583
这儿 坐下就好
Right there. Just sit down.

241
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:25,084
都高兴点 别郁郁寡欢的
Cheer up and don't be so cast down.

242
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:39,428
要是想活下去 尽可能少当出头鸟
If you want to survive, do and say as little as possible.

243
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:45,138
不要告诉任何人你的真实身份 也不要告诉任何人你会读会写
Tell no one who you really are and tell no one you can read and write.

244
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:50,242
除非你想成为棺材里的黑鬼
Unless you want to be a dead nigger.

245
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,334
现在可以闭嘴了吧
Now keep your mouth shut.

246
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,927
我说咱们该跟他们斗
I say we fight.

247
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,422
船员并不多
The crew is fairly small.

248
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,608
要是他们考虑周到的话 他们很可能火力充足
Were it well planned, I believe they could be strong-armed.

249
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,510
区区三个人不可能跟整个船上的对着干
Three can't go against the whole crew.

250
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,638
这儿其他人都是黑奴
The rest here are niggers.

251
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,349
地地道道的黑奴
Born and bred slaves.

252
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,768
黑奴是不会反抗的
Niggers ain't got no stomach for a fight.

253
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,277
一个都不会
Not a damn one.

254
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:37,235
我只知道 要是被运到那里...
All's I know, if we get where we're traveling...

255
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:39,070
我们不如死了算了
we'll wish we'd died trying.

256
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,702
不要意气用事
Survival's not about certain death,

257
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:44,322
只有低调行事才能活下去
it's about keeping your head down.

258
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:50,127
几天之前 我还在家里...
Days ago, I was with my family...

259
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,460
和家人在一起
in my home.

260
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:57,343
但现在一切都没了
Now you tell me all is lost.

261
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,681
"别告诉任何人自己的真实身份" 这样就能活命了?
"Tell no one who I am." That's the way to survive?

262
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,974
我要的不只是活命
Well, I don't want to survive.

263
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:12,642
而是生活
I want to live.

264
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,070
真羡慕
Better off.

265
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,571
太羡慕他了
Better than us.

266
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,836
怎么没看到他
I don't see him.

267
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:04,720
克莱门斯!
Clemens!

268
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,717
- 克莱门斯・瑞!  - 主人!
- Clemens Ray!  - Master!

269
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,097
- 克莱门斯!  - 瑞老爷!
- Clemens!  - Master Ray, sir!

270
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,509
瑞老爷!
Master Ray!

271
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:10,796
谁是管事的?
Who's in charge here?

272
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:11,927
我是船长!
I'm the captain!

273
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,266
我是乔纳斯・瑞先生
I'm Mr. Jonus Ray.

274
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,022
我的律师这有份证明...
My solicitor has documentation...

275
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,933
黑奴克莱门斯・瑞是我的财产
verifying the negro known as Clemens Ray is my property.

276
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,444
我可没听说过这件事
I know nothing of this arrangement.

277
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,454
立刻将他归还
You are ordered to return that property

278
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,231
否则你将面临盗窃罪起诉
immediately or be charged with thievery.

279
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:26,693
放了他!
Free him!

280
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:30,737
主人
Master.

281
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,702
瑞老爷
Master Ray, sir.

282
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,083
克莱门斯!
Clemens!

283
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,442
- 克莱门斯!  - 把他带回去!
- Clemens!  - Get him back!

284
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:37,954
克莱门斯!
Clemens!

285
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,621
克莱门斯!
Clemens!

286
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,381
克莱门斯!
Clemens!

287
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,083
帕克先生
Mr. Parker.

00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:49,802
吃点东西 再好好休息
Something to eat, and some rest.

430
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,408
你很快就会忘掉孩子们的
Your children will soon be forgotten.

431
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:21,000
你们这些新来的黑奴可能不知道...
For all of you raw niggers that don't know...

432
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:25,546
我叫约翰・底比斯 是威廉姆・福特家的首席木匠
my name is John Tibeats, William Ford's chief carpenter.

433
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:29,091
你们应该叫我"主人"
You will refer to me as "Master."

434
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,978
查平先生是这个农场的监工
Mr. Chapin is the overseer on this plantation.

435
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:37,687
你们也得称他"主人"
You, too, will refer to him as "Master."

436
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,731
鼓掌吧
So, clap your hands.

437
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,991
就像这样 快点
Like this. Come on.

438
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,115
快点鼓掌
Come on, now. Clap your hands.

439
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:56,543
# 黑奴跑 黑奴跳 #
# Nigger run Nigger flew #

440
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,079
# 黑奴撕碎衣衫 #
# Nigger tore his shirt in two #

441
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:01,590
# 快跑快跑 奴隶主会抓到你 #
# Run, run The Pattyroller will get you #

442
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,796
# 黑奴快跑 快点跑 #
# Run, nigger, run Well, you better get away #

443
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:10,215
没错 就是这样
That's right. Like you mean it.

444
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:13,431
# 黑奴快快跑 #
# Nigger run Run so fast #

445
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,937
# 把头伸进了马蜂窝 #
# Stove his head in a hornet's nest #

446
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:18,064
# 快跑快跑 奴隶主会抓到你 #
# Run, run The Pattyroller will get you #

447
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:21,227
# 黑奴快跑 快点跑 #
# Run, nigger, run Well, you better get away #

448
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:24,321
# 黑奴快跑 奴隶主会抓到你 #
# nigger, run The Pattyroller will get you #

449
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,652
# 黑奴快跑 快点跑 #
# Run, nigger, run Well, you better get away #

450
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,652
# 有人说黑奴从不偷窃 #
# Some folk say a nigger don't steal #

451
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,992
# 我就抓到过三次 #
# I caught three in my corn field #

452
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,327
# 一个偷了一蒲式耳 一个偷了两加仑 #
# One has a bushel And one has a peck #

453
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,663
# 还有一个脖子上缠了一捆绳子 #
# One has a rope It was hung around his neck #

454
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:40,249
# 黑奴快跑 奴隶主会抓到你 #
# Run nigger, run The Pattyroller will get you #

455
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,665
# 黑奴快跑 快点跑 #
# Run, nigger, run Well, you better get away #

456
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:45,004
# 黑奴快跑 奴隶主会抓到你 #
# Run nigger, run The Pattyroller will get you #

457
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,840
# 黑奴快跑 快点跑 #
# Run, nigger, run Well, you better get away #

458
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:50,347
# 嘿 奴隶主先生 别抓我 #
# Hey, Mr. Pattyroller Don't catch me #

459
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,849
# 去抓那个躲在树后的黑奴吧 #
# Catch that nigger behind that tree #

460
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:55,352
# 黑奴快跑 奴隶主会抓到你 #
# Run nigger, run The Pattyroller will get you #

461
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,729
# 黑奴快跑 快点跑 #
# Run, nigger, run Well, you better get away #

462
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:00,015
# 黑奴快跑 奴隶主会抓到你 #
# Run nigger, run The Pattyroller will get you #

463
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,354
# 黑奴快跑 快点跑 #
# Run, nigger, run Well, you better get away #

464
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,690
# 黑奴快跑 奴隶主会抓到你 #
# Run nigger, run The Pattyroller will get you #

465
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,855
# 黑奴快跑 快点跑 #
# Run, nigger, run Well, you better get away #

466
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:10,154
"我乃亚伯拉罕之神 以撒之神...
"I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac...

467
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:12,658
雅各之神
and the God of Jacob.

468
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,531
当世人听到这些
And when the multitude heard this,

469
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:18,371
都被他的教义所震惊
they were astonished at his doctrine.

470
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,170
他们中有一位律师...
And then one of them, which was a lawyer...

471
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:25,549
问了他一个有趣的问题"
asked him a question, tempting him."

472
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:23,769
小溪很深 可以载船
The creek is plenty deep enough to sail.

473
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:26,485
船上装满货物也没问题
Even with a boat full of load.

474
00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:27,843
从工地到到河口
The distance from the work area

475
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:28,944
那边的距离...
to the point on the latter bayou...

476
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,822
从水路走要比陆路近好几英里
is several miles by water fewer than land.

477
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,527
我觉得这样的运输费用
It occurs to me that the expense of transportation

478
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:34,242
会大幅度减少...
would be materially diminished...

479
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:35,448
"大幅度减少"?
"Materially diminished"?

480
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,578
如果我们走水路的话
If we use the waterway.

481
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:40,490
你是工程师 还是黑奴?
Are you an engineer, or a nigger?

482
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:45,287
你是工程师 还是黑奴?
Are you an engineer, or a nigger?

483
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,626
让他把话说完
Let the man say his piece.

484
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:51,464
这是很多工程师精心设计的
It's a scheme. Plenty of engineers have schemed similarly.

485
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,175
那里河道太窄了
The passes are too tight.

486
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,633
我认为最窄的地方也有12英寸
I reckon them at more than 12 feet at their most narrow.

487
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,301
只要让一队黑奴去开路
Wide enough for a tub to traverse

488
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:00,848
就足够让船通行了
if a team of niggers cleared it out.

489
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,763
你懂运输和土地改革吗?
And you know what of transport and terraforming?

490
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,648
我在山普伦运河当过修理工...
I labored repairing the Champlain canal...

491
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:09,152
在威廉・范・诺特维克手下
on the section over which William Van Nortwick was superintendent.

492
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,189
我用所得雇了几个得力助手...
With my earnings, I hired several efficient hands to assist me...

493
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,652
还参与了
and entered into contracts for

494
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,070
从尚普兰湖...
the transportation of large rafts of timber...

495
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,702
运输木材的大宗合同...
from Lake Champlain to Troy.

496
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,492
不管你信不信 反正我是信了
Well, I'll admit to being impressed even if you won't.

497
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:26,582
召集人马 大显身手吧
Collect a team. See what good you can do.

498
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,922
好了吗? 搞定它!
You good? Clear it out!

499
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,356
二 三...
Two, three...

500
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:44,353
# 一切已迟 #
# Too late for me #

501
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:47,561
# 活着或死 #
# I live or die #

502
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:50,853
# 伏身哭泣 #
# Lay down and cry #

503
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:54,114
# 哦 我累了 #
# Hey, boy I'm tired #

504
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,367
# 亲爱的主啊 #
# My lord Sometimes #

505
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,779
# 让我变强吧 #
# I'm strong Yes, sir #

506
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:04,324
# 让我变壮吧 #
# I'm tall Yes, sir #

507
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,298
普莱特 你真是个天才
Platt, you are a marvel.

508
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,682
怎么这么久才过来?
What took you so long?

509
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,306
谢谢 福特老爷
Thank you, Master Ford.

510
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,204
普莱特
Platt.

511
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,635
太感谢了 福特老爷
My great thanks, Master Ford.

512
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,895
不 是我该谢你
No, my thanks to you.

513
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,351
这是你应得的
And it is the least of it.

514
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:12,768
希望这个能带给我们俩欢乐
I hope it brings us both much joy over the years.

515
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,636
天啊!
God!

516
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,642
艾来萨
Eliza.

517
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:56,979
艾来萨
Eliza.

518
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:58,730
别哭了!
Stop!

519
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:01,149
别再哭了!
Stop your wailing!

520
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,032
如果你就这样自暴自弃
If you let yourself be overcome

521
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:06,621
你会被毁了的
by sorrow, you will drown in it.

522
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,497
你不思念你的孩子们吗?
Have you stopped crying for your children?

523
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:13,829
虽然你不说 但是你能忘得了他们吗?
You make no sounds, but will you ever let them go in your heart?

524
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,001
他们可是我身上掉下来的肉
They are as my flesh.

525
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:22,170
谁不痛苦?
Then who is distressed?

526
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,174
我惹主人和夫人不高兴了?
Do I upset the master and the mistress?

527
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,684
难道他们的好心情比我心碎重要?
Do you care less about my loss than their well-being?

528
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,185
福特老爷是个好人
Master Ford is a decent man.

529
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:30,470
他是个奴隶主!
He is a slaver!

530
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:31,654
那是环境所迫
Under the circumstances.

531
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,477
就算是环境所迫 他也是个奴隶主
Under the circumstances, he is a slaver.

532
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,683
你对他卑躬屈膝
But you truckle at his boot.

533
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,477
对他逢迎讨好
You luxuriate in his favor.

534
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:39,362
我是为了生存!
I survive!

535
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,568
我不会自暴自弃!
I will not fall into despair!

536
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:43,699
我会向福特老爷贡献计策!
I will offer up my talents to Master Ford!

537
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,657
我要坚持到重获自由那一天!
I will keep myself hearty until freedom is opportune!

538
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,867
福特能给你自由?
Ford is your opportunity?

539
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:52,409
你以为他不知道你别有用心?
You think he does not know that you are more than you suggest?

540
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,248
但他什么也不帮你
But he does nothing for you.

541
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,582
什么也不
Nothing.

542
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:59,504
你和那些牲畜没什么两样
You are no better than prized livestock.

543
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,418
告诉他呀 告诉他!
Call for him. Call!

544
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,712
告诉他你以前的事情
Tell him of your previous circumstances,

545
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,051
看他会怎么做 所罗门
and see what it earns you, Solomon.

546
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:10,392
你就这样接受了普莱特这个身份?
So, you've settled into your role as Platt, then?

547
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:15,615
我的后背都是伤疤...
My back is thick with scars...

548
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,063
那都是自由的代价
for protesting my freedom.

549
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:19,648
不要责怪我
Do not accuse me.

550
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:24,073
我没责怪你 我没有
I accuse you of nothing. I cannot accuse.

551
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:27,156
为了生存 我也不得不屈服...
I have done dishonorable things to survive...

552
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,322
但是到头来 却还是落到这般田地
and for all of them, I have ended up here.

553
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:33,871
如果我勇敢地站出来 结果也不会更糟
No better than if I stood up for myself.

554
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,745
上帝 宽恕我吧
God, forgive me.

555
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,710
所罗门 让我为我的孩子哭一会吧!
Solomon, let me weep for my children!

556
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:52,185
"无论是谁 都要如同
"Whosoever, therefore, shall humble

557
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,429
婴孩般卑微...
himself as this little child...

558
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:58,775
平等是天堂里最重要的原则
the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

559
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:03,860
若有人得幸能够抚育我的孩子..."
And who so shall receive one such little child in my name..."

560
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,865
我体会不了那种忧愁
I cannot have that kind of depression about.

561
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:08,197
"若有人侵犯我的孩子...
"But who so shall offend one of these little ones...

562
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,254
他最好在脖子挂上石头...
it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck...

563
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:16,125
然后深沉入大海之中"
and he were drowned in the depth of the sea."

564
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,202
阿门
Amen.

565
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:19,917
阿门
Amen.

566
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,811
把它们弄光滑点
Make them boards flush.

567
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,141
已经很光滑了 先生
They are, sir.

568
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:38,306
不 不够光滑
No, they is no such thing.

569
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:43,061
他们就像小马的皮毛一样光滑
They are as smooth to the touch as a yearling's coat.

570
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,569
你是在说我说谎吗?
Are you calling me a liar, boy?

571
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:52,829
您误会我了 先生
It's all a matter of perspective, sir.

572
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:55,131
可能从你的角度看来会有所不同
From where you stand, you may see differently,

573
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:56,783
但是我的手艺不会有差的
but the hands are not mistaken.

574
00:42:57,325 --> 00:43:01,580
我只希望您在下结论前要好好体会一下
I simply ask that you use all your senses before rendering judgment.

575
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:06,342
天啊 你真不知礼
Oh, my, you are a brute.

576
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,428
你这个狗崽子
You are a dog.

577
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,762
还很不守规矩!
And no better for following instruction!

578
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,193
我按命令做的
I do as ordered.

579
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:16,418
那你黎明就起床
Then you'll be up at daybreak.

580
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:19,351
从查平那里拿一桶钉子...
You will procure a keg of nails from Chapin...

581
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,516
开始钉护墙板
and commence to putting on clapboards.

582
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:22,854
遵命 先生
Yes, sir.

583
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:29,987
把它们弄光滑
Make them boards flush.

584
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,369
不要 求你了! 求你了 山姆!
No, please! Please, Sam!

585
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:43,880
你们要带我去哪? 要带我去哪 山姆? 
Where am I going? Where am I going, Sam?

586
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:46,875
所罗门! 所罗门!
Solomon! Solomon!

587
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,713
所罗门!
Solomon!

588
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:51,342
所罗门!
Solomon!

589
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,055
所罗门!
Solomon!

590
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,818
我的主人很喜欢我 你懂的
When I say I had my Master's favor, you understand.

591
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:09,522
这九年来...
And for nine years...

592
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:13,569
他让我生活得丰衣足食
he blessed me with every comfort and luxury in life.

593
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:16,203
给我丝绸 首饰...
Silks and jewels...

594
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,831
甚至还有人伺候我们
and even servants to wait upon us.

595
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,331
这样的生活
Such was our life.

596
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,373
我为他生下了一双儿女
And the life of this beautiful girl I bore for him.

597
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:31,715
但贝瑞太太的女儿...
But Master Berry's daughter...

598
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,549
她一直都看我不顺眼
she always looked at me with an unkind nature.

599
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:40,061
她憎恨艾米丽 虽然她们是亲生姐妹
And she hated Emily, no matter she and Emily were flesh of flesh.

600
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,849
贝瑞太太的身体垮了
As Master Berry's health failed,

601
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:46,601
那个家就是她说的算...
she gained power of the household...

602
00:44:47,024 --> 00:44:49,745
最后因为自由证的问题...
and eventually, I was brought to the city under the false pretense...

603
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,569
我被带到了城里
of our free papers being executed.

604
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:58,909
我可怜的孩子们
My poor children.

605
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:40,614
我不是告诉过你装上护墙板吗?
I thought I told you to commence to putting on clapboards.

606
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:44,500
我正在这么做 主人 这些已经换好了
Yes, Master, I'm about it. These have all been replaced.

607
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,913
我不是还说拿一桶钉子来吗?
And didn't I tell you to get a keg of nails?

608
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,752
我拿来了
And so, I did.

609
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,924
拿来了
So, you did.

610
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,674
该死的 你怎么什么都做不好!
God damn you. I thought you knowed something!

611
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,338
我按照您吩咐做的
I did as instructed.

612
00:45:57,505 --> 00:46:00,725
如果我做错 那也是因为您吩咐错了
If there's something wrong, it's wrong with the instruction.

613
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,177
你这个黑鬼
You black bastard.

614
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:08,600
该死的黑鬼
You goddamn black bastard.

615
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,814
把衣服脱了
Strip your clothes.

616
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:14,317
脱了
Strip.

617
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:16,861
我不脱
I will not.

618
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:32,542
你活不过今天的 黑鬼!
You will not live to see another day, nigger!

619
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:34,674
救命啊!
Help!

620
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,716
杀人了!
Murder!

621
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,011
我错了!
I'm sorry!

622
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,889
我错了! 我错了!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

623
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,526
怎么回事?
What is the matter?

624
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,190
怎么回事?
What is the matter?

625
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,439
底比斯老爷因为我用了
Master Tibeats wants to whip me

626
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:58,040
您给我的钉子而要打我
for using the nails you gave me.

627
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:01,987
这事我跟你没完
This ain't done by half.

628
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:04,664
你会付出代价的
I will have flesh.

629
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,075
血的代价!
And I will have all of it!

630
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:11,837
别乱走动
Do not stir.

631
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:15,709
别离开庄园 因为出了这里我就没法保护你了
Do not leave the plantation. For, if you run, I cannot protect you.

632
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:17,756
待在这里
Stay here.

633
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:25,073
先生们 谁敢动这个黑奴我就跟他不客气
Gentlemen, whoever moves that nigger is a dead man.

634
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:29,870
我是这个农场的监工
I am the overseer on this plantation.

635
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:32,751
威廉・福特持有普莱特的所有权
William Ford holds the mortgage on Platt.

636
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,668
如果你们绞死他 福特先生会损失惨重的
If you hang him, he will lose his debt.

637
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,503
你们无权处置他的财产
You have no claim to his life.

638
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:40,505
还有你们俩...
As for you two...

639
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:43,672
要是还想继续活着的话...
if you have any regard for your own safety...

640
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:44,805
就快给我滚!
I say, be gone!

641
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:50,227
你没有权利!
You got no cause!

642
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:53,856
普莱特是我的人 我愿意怎么处置都行!
Platt is mine, and mine to do with as I please!

643
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,937
你要是敢动...
If you touch...

644
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:22,964
山姆!
Sam!

645
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,092
骑着骡子 去找福特老爷
Fetch the mule. Get Master Ford.

646
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:23,266
普莱特 可怜的普莱特
Platt. Poor Platt.

647
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:55,347
我想底比斯就潜伏在附近某处
I believe Tibeats is skulking about the premises somewhere.

648
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:58,726
他会想方设法地置你于死地
He wants you dead, and he will have it so.

649
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:01,103
这里很不安全
It's no longer safe for you here.

650
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:05,061
如果底比斯动手 你肯定会还手
And I don't believe you will remain passive if Tibeats attacks.

651
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:08,273
我把你转给了艾德文・艾普斯
I have transferred my debt to Edwin Epps.

652
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,358
他会负责你...
He will take charge...

653
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,714
福特老爷
Master Ford.

654
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:37,840
您一定要明白 我不是奴隶
You must know that I'm not a slave.

655
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:39,345
不要说这些
I cannot hear that.

656
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:41,476
来到你家之前 我是个自由人
Before I came to you, I was a freeman.

657
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:44,309
我这是在救你!
I'm trying to save your life!

658
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:48,021
我一直在为你操心
And I have a debt to be mindful of.

659
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:52,442
现在换成艾德文・艾普斯了
And that is to Edwin Epps now.

660
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:55,403
他不好对付 对黑奴心狠手辣
And he is a hard man. Prides himself on being a nigger breaker.

661
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:58,615
但我实在找不到别人愿意接受你
But truthfully, I could find no others who would take you.

662
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:01,697
你已经臭名远扬了
You've made a reputation of yourself.

663
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:07,165
不管在哪里 你都是一个特立独行的黑奴 普莱特
Whatever the circumstances, you are an exceptional nigger, Platt.

664
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,878
但这样对你没好处
But I fear no good will come of it.

665
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,403
"奴仆们要..."
"And that servant...

666
00:54:37,566 --> 00:54:40,115
谨记主的意志..."
which knew his lord's will..."

667
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:44,953
谨记主的意志
Which knew his lord's will.

668
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:51,710
"毫不顾己..."
"And prepared not himself..."

669
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:55,876
毫不顾己
Prepared not himself.

670
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:02,596
"也不擅自行事..."
"Neither did according to his will..."

671
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:07,725
否则鞭刑不怠"
shall be beaten with many stripes."

672
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:10,524
明白了吗?
Do you hear that?

673
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:12,526
"鞭刑"
"Stripes."

674
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:15,897
若不服从主的意愿...
That nigger that don't obey his lord...

675
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:18,111
也就是服从主人 明白吗?
that's his master, do you see?

676
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:23,617
否则鞭刑不怠
That there nigger shall be beaten with many stripes.

677
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:29,039
这里的鞭刑指的是很多下
Now, "many" signifies a great many.

678
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:33,422
40下 100下 150下
40, 100, 150 lashes.

679
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:39,678
圣经里这么写的
That's scripture.

680
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,608
摘棉花
Pick that cotton.

681
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,694
动作快点
Move along, now.

682
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:04,786
快点 爱德华! 让那些黑奴快点!
Come on, Edward! Drive them niggers!

683
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:07,949
摘棉花! 动作快点
Pick that cotton! Move along, now.

684
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:10,625
磨蹭什么 小子? 快干!
What are you doing, boy? Come on!

685
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,672
鲍伯摘了240磅
240 for Bob.

686
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:18,091
詹姆斯多少?
What you got for James?

687
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,628
295磅
295 pounds.

688
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:23,843
干得不错 小子
That's real good, boy. That's real good.

689
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,592
普莱特摘了182磅
182 for Platt.

690
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:31,097
通常一个黑奴一天摘多少?
How much can even an average nigger pick a day?

691
00:56:31,263 --> 00:56:32,515
200磅吧
200 pounds.

692
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:34,558
这个黑奴没达到标准
This nigger ain't even average.

693
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,649
派茜摘了512磅
512 pounds for Patsey.

694
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:41,486
512磅!
512!

695
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:46,404
派茜比你们多摘了那么多 你们不脸红吗?
You menfolk got no shame letting Patsey out-pick you.

696
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:51,538
她每天都能摘500多磅
The day ain't yet come she swung lower than 500 pounds.

697
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:57,339
她真是农场女王
Queen of the fields, she is.

698
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:58,544
138磅...
138 pounds...

699
00:56:58,707 --> 00:57:00,459
我还没说完 特里奇
I ain't done, Treach.

700
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:04,763
我想表扬派茜一下 难道不行吗?
Ain't I owed a minute to luxuriate on the work Patsey done?

701
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:06,469
当然行 先生
Yes, sir.

702
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:12,187
农场女王
Damn queen.

703

天生的农场工人

黑奴中的佼佼者
A nigger among niggers.

705
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,691
上帝将她赐予我
And God gave her to me.

706
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,786
是我正直人生的回馈
A lesson in the rewards of righteous living.

707
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:35,961
显而易见

708
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:39,047
是的!

714
00:57:56,098 --> 00:57:57,566
229磅

715
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:58,896
把他拖出来
Get him out.

716
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:00,481

卖了她

726
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:33,588
这是怎么回事?
What's all this?

727
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:36,258
你得把她卖掉

卖掉小派茜?

729
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:41,104
她比其他黑奴摘的棉花都多

730
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:42,405
卖另一个吧
Choose another to go.

731
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:44,057
不行
No other.

732
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:45,567
卖了她
Sell her.

733
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:47,311
我不卖
I will not.

734
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:51,532
你立刻把这个黑婊子卖掉...
You will remove that black bitch from this property...

735
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:54,614
否则我就回城里去

736
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:00,661
回到你原来的那个猪圈里?

737
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:07,498
不要跟派茜过不去 亲爱的
Do not set yourself up against Patsey, my dear.

738
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:13,257
因为我不会卖了她
Because I will rid myself of you

739
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:15,263
但我会甩了你
well before I do away with her.

740
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,727
看什么看?
What you looking at?

741
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:27,689
臭娘们
Damn woman.

742
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:30,570
我不会让她打扰我的雅兴
I won't have my mood spoiled.

743
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:32,822
不会的
I will not.

744
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:35,031
接着跳
Dance.

745
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:36,902
都给我跳起来!
Dance, I says!

746
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:42,950
跳起来!
Come on!

747
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:46,511
继续拉 普莱特 就拉这首 
Pick it up, Platt. Play that fiddle, boy.

748
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:24,115
普莱特
Platt.

749
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:27,460
在 夫人?
Yes, Mistress?

750
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:32,045
你能找到去巴塞洛缪的杂货铺的路吗?
Can you find your way to Bartholomew's?

751
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:33,918
我可以 夫人
I can, ma'am.

752
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:36,086
这个单子上列了一些东西
This is a list of goods and sundries.

753
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:39,177
你把上面列的买完后马上回来
You will take it to be filled and return immediately.

754
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:41,558
带上你的奴隶牌
Take your tag.

755
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:43,514
告诉巴塞洛缪记在我们账上
Tell Bartholomew to add it to our debt.

756
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:44,678
是 夫人
Yes, Mistress.

757
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:48,940
你老家是哪的 普莱特?
Where you from, Platt?

758
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:52,311
我告诉过您
I told you.

759
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:54,229
再跟我说一遍
Tell me again.

760
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:55,772
华盛顿
Washington.

761
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:56,906
你以前的主人是谁?
Who were your master?

762
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:57,990
是弗里曼
Master name a Freeman.

763
01:02:58,149 --> 01:02:59,901
他有文化吗?
Was he a learned man?

764
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:02,328
我想是的
I suppose so.

765
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:03,909
是他教你认的字?
He learn you to read?

766
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:07,993
一点点而已 他时不时就教教我
A word, here or there.

767
01:03:08,335 --> 01:03:10,095
但我完全不会写...
But I have no understanding of the written...

768
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,339
别给自己找麻烦去学写字
Don't trouble yourself with it.

769
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:16,293
你和其他黑奴一样 你的主人买你回来仅仅是干活用的
Same as the rest. Master brought you here to work, that's all.

770
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,134
过了这个界限 小心鞭子伺候
Any more will earn you 100 lashes.

771
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:27,113
过来 小子
Come here, boy.

772
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:31,459
来啊
Come on.

773
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:49,307
你要去哪 小子?
Where you going, boy?

774
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:51,972
去巴塞洛缪的杂货铺
On my way to Bartholomew's.

775
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:54,391
艾普斯夫人让我去的
Sent by Mistress Epps.

776
01:04:58,186 --> 01:05:00,154
那么 你最好是要去那里
You best get there, then.

777
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:02,824
动作要快
Get there quick.

778
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:53,208
路上有碰到麻烦吗?
Any trouble?

779
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:55,869
没有 夫人 一切顺利
No, ma'am. No trouble.

780
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:56,312
普莱特・艾普斯 周日早上好
Platt Epps, good Sunday morning.

781
01:06:56,471 --> 01:06:57,768
早上好 肖老爷
Good morning, Master Shaw.

782
01:06:57,931 --> 01:07:00,400
主人让我来找派茜 我能进去吗?
Master sent me to retrieve Patsey. May I approach?

783
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:01,775
可以
You may.

784
01:07:12,237 --> 01:07:13,864
打扰您了 肖夫人
Excuse me, Mistress Shaw.

785
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,623
什么事 黑奴普莱特
Nigger Platt.

786
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:17,580
派茜 主人希望你现在回去
Patsey, Master wishes you to return.

787
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:19,369
今天是安息日 我是可以自由活动的
The Sabbath day, I is free to roam.

788
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:22,539
老爷让我跑过来找你 他说不能浪费一分一秒
Master sent me running to fetch you, said no time should be wasted.

789
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:24,416
坐下喝杯茶吧?
Drink of tea?

790
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:26,459
谢谢 夫人 但我不敢
Thank you, Mistress, but I don't dare.

791
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:28,628
即使你准时回去了
Would you know of Master Epps's consternation

792
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:31,969
艾普斯老爷就会变得稍微温柔一点吗?
to be any lessened with your timely return?

793
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:34,930
他常年处在生气的状态
Anger's his constant condition.

794
01:07:35,093 --> 01:07:35,889
坐下
Sit.

795
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:38,642
坐下 喝点茶 算我赏的
Sit and drink the tea that I offered.

796
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:45,954
艾普斯在担心什么?
What'n be Epps's concern?

797
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:49,490
我还是不说的好
I'd rather not say.

798
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:54,321
安息日来点小八卦不碍事的 适量来点就好
Oh, little gossip on the Sabbath be fine. All things in moderation.

799
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,120
您也知道...
As you are aware...

800
01:07:58,283 --> 01:08:04,165
艾普斯老爷总是不苟言笑
Master Epps is a man of hard countenance.

801
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:06,670
您也知道他不喜欢您丈夫
You know he has ill feeling towards your husband.

802
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:08,085
他确实不喜欢
He do.

803
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:11,096
艾普斯老爷不知怎么的 认为...
Master Epps has somehow come to believe...

804
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:15,259
肖老爷是个色狼
that Master Shaw is something of a lothario.

805
01:08:16,843 --> 01:08:19,312
这肯定是搞错了 毫无疑问的
A misguided belief, no doubt.

806
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:20,642
毫无疑问...
No doubt...

807
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:22,933
空穴来风 未必无因
if not born out of truth itself.

808
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:26,777
我没有冒犯的意思
I meant no disrespect.

809
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:28,984
他没听到你的话
He ain't heard you.

810
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:31,666
我也没有冒犯您的意思 夫人
I meant no disrespect to you, Mistress.

811
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:38,164
没必要担心我的感受
Got no cause to worry for my sensibilities.

812
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:43,503
我都不记得鞭子是什么滋味了
I ain't felt the end of a lash in more years I can recall.

813
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:45,755
我也从没干过粗活
I ain't worked a field, neither.

814
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:48,170
我曾服侍过别人...
Where once I served...

815
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:51,257
但现在 是别人来服侍我了
now, I have others serving me.

816
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:54,472
这是我现在地位的代价...
The cost to my current existence...

817
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:57,760
肖老爷到处宣扬他对我的爱的代价...
be Master Shaw broadcasting his affections...

818
01:08:57,925 --> 01:09:00,769
还有我享受他好丈夫表演的代价
and me enjoying the pantomime of his fidelity.

819
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:06,564
如果这些能让我远离摘棉花的黑奴生活 就这样继续吧
If that what keep me from cotton picking niggers, that what it be.

820
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:10,447
这个代价很小 也很合理 
A small and reasonable price to be paid, for sure.

821
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:17,450
我知道成为老爷的意中人
I know what it like to be the object

822
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:20,164
和心仪对象的感觉
of Master's predilections and peculiarities.

823
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:23,952
一到晚上 等待你的不是被侵犯...
A lusty visit in the night...

824
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:26,587
就是被毒打
or a visitation with the whip.

825
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:29,502
别担心 派茜
Take comfort, Patsey.

826
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:31,877
伟大的主会修理艾普斯的
The good Lord will manage Epps.

827
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:36,886
在最后审判的时刻 伟大的主会修理他们所有人的
In his own time, the good Lord will manage them all.

828
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:40,427
法老的诅咒就是那些...
The curse of the pharaohs were a poor example...

829
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:43,517
种植园主的悲惨下场
of what wait for the plantation class.

830
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:50,608
现在很不错
This is nice.

831
01:10:01,948 --> 01:10:04,497
小茜 派茜!
Pats. Patsey!

832
01:10:04,659 --> 01:10:06,332
别朝他那个方向看 继续走
Do not look in his direction. Continue on.

833
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:08,705
- 派茜!  - 找到她了 主人
- Patsey!  - Found her, Master.

834
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,503
我也把她带回来了 按照您吩咐的那样
And brought her back, just as instructed.

835
01:10:14,085 --> 01:10:16,213
你刚才跟她说了什么?
What did you just now tell her?

836
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:18,052
你刚才对小茜说了什么?
What did you say to Pats?

837
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:20,967
一个字都没说 什么都没有
No words were spoken, none of consequence.

838
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,353
你是个骗子
You're a liar.

839
01:10:24,679 --> 01:10:26,647
你他妈是个骗子
You damn liar.

840
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:29,688
我看到你跟她说话了
I saw you talking with her.

841
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,190
告诉我
Tell me.

842
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:35,531
我说不出我根本没说过的话
I cannot speak of what did not occur.

843
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:37,567
我要割断你那黑黢黢的脖子!
I'll cut your black throat!

844
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:38,860
主人!
Master!

845
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:40,824
你过来
You come here.

846
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:42,355
- 艾普斯老爷  - 我说 过来!
- Master Epps.  - I said come here!

847
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:43,888
我把她带回来了 按照您...
I brought her back, just like you...

848
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:46,709
- 过来!  - 主人!
- Come here!  - Master!

849
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:49,912
主人
Master.

850
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:54,835
我找到了她 按照您吩咐的那样
I got her, just as instructed.

851
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:57,211
艾普斯老爷!
Master Epps!

852
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:59,005
你离小茜远一点 兔崽子
You stay away from Pats, boy.

853
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:06,562
艾普斯老爷
Master Epps.

854
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:35,249
今天是安息日
It's the Lord's day.

855
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:39,588
哪有基督徒是像我们这样的
Ain't nothing Christian in us carrying on like this.

856
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,020
你赢了
I concede to you.

857
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:52,020
勇敢一点...
In the name of valor...

858
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:54,901
扶你的主人起来
help your master to his feet.

859
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:00,691
我要宰了你!
I'm gonna kill you!

860
01:12:01,192 --> 01:12:02,694
怎么回事?
What's the fuss?

861
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,533
艾普斯老爷以为派茜和我在说话
Master Epps believed Patsey and me

862
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:06,327
但我们根本没有
to be in conversation when we were not.

863
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:07,741
我想解释 但最后就变成了这样
I tried to explain, but it's led to all this.

864
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:08,749
这是怎么回事?
What is it?

865
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:12,044
你见不着她连安息日都过不下去了?
You can't remain the Sabbath without her under your eye?

866
01:12:12,203 --> 01:12:14,013
你就是个没种的混蛋
You are a no-account bastard.

867
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:16,040
肮脏的 目中无神的蛮子
A filthy, godless heathen.

868
01:12:16,207 --> 01:12:18,835
我的床对你而言太过神圣了
My bed is too holy for you to share.

869
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:20,093
他都告诉你了什么?
What's he been telling you?

870
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:21,596
你的那些无耻行径
Of your misbegotten ways.

871
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:23,756
他都知道些什么?
And he would know what of anything?

872
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:26,759
我今天都还没和他说过话
I ain't even spoken with him today.

873
01:12:27,552 --> 01:12:29,429
你个满嘴谎言的黑鬼 普莱特
You lying nigger, Platt.

874
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:31,188
我有吗?
Have I?

875
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:34,775
我有吗?
Have I?

876
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:39,776
看 那就是他所谓的真相
There. There's all the truth he got.

877
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:42,025
该死的黑鬼
Damn nigger.

878
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:35,138
派茜
Patsey.

879
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:34,344
舞会的休息时间到了
A moment from the dancing.

880
01:16:35,508 --> 01:16:37,761
看看我给你们都准备了什么
Come sample what I baked for y'all.

881
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:40,738
谢谢 夫人
Thank you, Mistress.

882
01:16:40,763 --> 01:16:41,864
谢谢 夫人
Thank you, Mistress.

883
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:44,017
没你的份 派茜
There will be none for you, Patsey.

884
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:47,020
你看到了吗?
You see that?

885
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:50,193
你看到她对我那傲慢的表情了吗?
You see that look of insolence she give me?

886
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:52,525
除了她转过身去 我什么都没看到 
I seen nothing but her turn away.

887
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:54,910
你是真瞎了还是故意的?
Are you blind or ignorant?

888
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:57,367
那是毒辣辣的 充满仇恨的蔑视
It was hot, hateful scorn.

889
01:16:57,530 --> 01:16:59,624
都写在那张黢黑的脸上
It filled that black face.

890
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:01,509
你告诉我你没看到...
You tell me you didn't see it...

891
01:17:01,534 --> 01:17:05,539
要么是因为你选择视而不见 要么你的意思是我在说谎?
it's because you choose not to look, or are you saying I lie?

892
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:08,048
不管是哪种 都已经过去了
Whatever it was, it passed.

893
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:11,460
你就是这么对黑鬼的?
Is that how you are with the niggers?

894
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:15,218
让每一丝邪恶的想法都在他们内心疯狂滋生?
Letting every ill thought fester inside them?

895
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:17,387
看看他们
Look at them.

896
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:19,723
他们心里满满都是
They foul with it.

897
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:21,979
满满都是仇恨的种子
They foul with their hate.

898
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:26,726
你如果放任不管 他们就会在夜晚来报复我们
You let it be, it's gonna come back to us in the dark of night.

899
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:28,439
你想要这样的结果?
You want that?

900
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:31,864
你想让这些黑鬼趁我们熟睡的时候宰了我们
You want them black animals leave us

901
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:34,655
然后内脏流的到处都是?
gut like pigs in our own sleep?

902
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:36,193
哦...
Oh...

903
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:40,073
你真不是个爷们
You are manless.

904
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:42,913
即便你是个男的 也是个阉货
A damn eunuch if there ever was.

905
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:45,335
即便你不同意我的话 我想你至少也该
If you won't stand for me, I pray you'd

906
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:47,250
证明自己是个爷们
at least be a credit to your own kind

907
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:49,632
把他们揍得服服帖帖的
and beat every foul thought from them.

908
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:01,093
把他们揍得服服帖帖的!
Beat it from them!

909
01:18:18,277 --> 01:18:19,119
吃吧
Eat.

910
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:21,989
吃饱了
Fill yourselves.

911
01:18:22,781 --> 01:18:24,033
然后继续跳舞
And then we dance.

912
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:31,708
听见没有 吃啊
I said, eat.

913
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:47,973
普莱特
Platt.

914
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:51,064
普莱特 你醒着吗?
Platt, you awake?

915
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:55,902
我醒着
I am.

916
01:18:57,066 --> 01:18:59,239
我有个请求
I have a request.

917
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:01,908
希望你能好心帮帮我
An act of kindness.

918
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:07,876
这是我从夫人那里偷来的
I secreted it from the mistress.

919
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:10,329
还回去
Return it.

920
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:12,169
它是你的了 普莱特
It yours, Platt.

921
01:19:13,499 --> 01:19:15,172
为什么?
For what cause?

922
01:19:15,334 --> 01:19:19,510
满足我的唯一请求 杀了我吧
All I ask, end my life.

923
01:19:20,714 --> 01:19:23,934
把我带到沼泽边缘
Take my body to the margin of the swamp.

924
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:27,097
掐住我的脖子 把我按在水里...
Take me by the throat, hold me low in the water...

925
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:29,937
直到我一动不动 死透了
until I is still and without life.

926
01:19:30,516 --> 01:19:32,268
把我埋在一个孤独的地方
Bury me in a lonely place of dying.

927
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:34,232
我不会做这种事的
I will do no such thing.

928
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:37,189
你刚才说的那些血淋淋的细节...
The gory detail with which you speak...

929
01:19:37,356 --> 01:19:39,859
我已经仔细想了很久很久
I thought on it long and hard.

930
01:19:41,235 --> 01:19:43,203
这只不过是忧郁症
It is melancholia.

931
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:45,281
不是别的
Nothing more.

932
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:49,247
你怎么会这么绝望?
How can you fall into such despair?

933
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:52,459
你怎么会不知道?
How can you not know?

934
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:58,552
我的生活一点都不快乐
I ain't got no comfort in this life.

935
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:04,884
如果你不能看在钱的份上帮我...
If I can't buy mercy from you...

936
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:07,144
那我只能求你了
I'll beg it.

937
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:08,896
还有别人
There are others.

938
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:11,398
- 去求他们吧  - 我在求你
- Beg them.  - I'm begging you.

939
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:12,729
为什么?
Why?

940
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:17,238
为什么你要我来做这件天理不容的事?
Why would you consign me to damnation with such an ungodly request?

941
01:20:17,396 --> 01:20:19,398
上帝就在这里!
There is God here!

942
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:23,657
上帝是仁慈的...
God is merciful...

943
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:26,447
他也会原谅仁慈的行为
and he forgive merciful acts.

944
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:29,325
你不会下地狱的
Won't be no hell for you.

945
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:32,662
杀了我吧
Do it.

946
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:40,799
替我完成这件我没有勇气去自己完成的事
Do what I ain't got the strength to do myself.

947
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:21,961
这是瘟疫
It's a plague.

948
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:24,008
是棉铃虫而已
It's cotton worm.

949
01:21:24,171 --> 01:21:26,970
这就是瘟疫 这是该死的圣经给我的指示
It's a plague. It's damn biblical.

950
01:21:28,175 --> 01:21:31,019
两季了 上帝降下瘟疫来毁灭我
Two seasons God done sent a plague to smite me.

951
01:21:33,472 --> 01:21:36,976
我做了什么让上帝如此恨我?
What I done that God hates me so?

952
01:21:43,148 --> 01:21:45,321
这就是目无上帝的人的命运
It's that godless lot.

953
01:21:47,194 --> 01:21:49,037
是他们把瘟疫带来的
They brought this on me.

954
01:21:49,196 --> 01:21:51,494
我带给他们上帝的福音
I bring them God's word and heathens

955
01:21:51,615 --> 01:21:53,868
而这些异教徒 却把上帝的诅咒带给我
they are, they brung me God's scorn.

956
01:21:57,538 --> 01:21:58,539
该死的!
Damn!

957
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:00,416
你个该死的!
Damn you!

958
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:03,211
你们所有人都该死!
Damn all y'all!

959
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:31,989
法官阁下
Judge.

960
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:33,828
艾普斯老爷
Mister Epps.

961
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:39,417
听到您不幸的消息 我深表遗憾
I am deeply saddened to hear about your misfortune.

962
01:22:39,997 --> 01:22:42,091
但我没从您出的价钱里看到您的遗憾
Your price don't reflect your concern.

963
01:22:44,168 --> 01:22:45,169
听着
Listen up.

964
01:22:45,836 --> 01:22:47,713
这一季 你们归特纳法官
You're Judge Turner's for the season.

965
01:22:47,838 --> 01:22:49,681
如果有必要的话 你们还得呆得更久 直到我的棉花继续开始长
More, if need be, until my crops return.

966
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:52,760
你们别给我丢脸
Y'all bring no disrespect to me.

967
01:22:52,926 --> 01:22:55,850
别把圣经里的瘟疫带给他 听到了吗?
Don't bring no biblical plagues to him, you hear?

968
01:22:56,013 --> 01:22:58,107
否则 我就会扒了你们的皮
Or I'll take it out on your skin.

969
01:22:59,099 --> 01:23:00,521
下来
Get out.

970
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:54,421
从门廊上下去 这不是你站的地方
Get off the porch. You ain't supposed to be on the porch.

971
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:55,743
快下去
Get off the porch.

972
01:24:02,454 --> 01:24:03,797
普莱特 是吗?
Platt, is it?

973
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:05,290
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

974
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:08,461
你以前种过甘蔗?
You cultivate cane previously?

975
01:24:08,961 --> 01:24:10,133
没有 先生 我没种过
No, sir, I have not.

976
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:12,468
你的动作很纯熟
It comes to you quite naturally.

977
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:13,632
你受过教育?
Are you educated?

978
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:17,678
没有 先生 黑奴是来干活的 不是来读书写字的
No, sir. Niggers are hired to work, not read or write.

979
01:24:19,513 --> 01:24:21,140
你会拉小提琴
You play the fiddle.

980
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,438
是的 先生 我会拉
Yes, sir. Yes, I do.

981
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:26,983
威拉德・亚纳 河上游的一个种植园主...
Willard Yarner, a planter up the bayou...

982
01:24:27,145 --> 01:24:30,445
三周后要庆祝他的结婚纪念日
celebrates his anniversary in three weeks' time.

983
01:24:30,607 --> 01:24:32,860
我会把你的名字报给他
I'll hold out your name to him.

984
01:24:33,026 --> 01:24:35,620
你赚的就自己收着吧
What you earn is yours to keep.

985
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,372
好的 先生
Yes, sir.

986
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:39,287
小心点 普莱特
Mind yourself, Platt.

987
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:08,500
安妮 玛格丽特 阿朗佐


988
01:26:55,127 --> 01:26:57,250
呜哇!
Whoa!

989
01:27:03,844 --> 01:27:05,187
多快乐的日子
Joyous day.

990
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:07,973
多快乐的日子
Joyous day.

991
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,893
黑暗的日子已经远去
Dark times is behind us.

992
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:14,484
严谨地生活和真诚地祈祷真的把瘟疫赶走了!
Clean living and prayer done lifted the plague!

993
01:27:16,356 --> 01:27:19,735
棉花就像新英格兰的雪一样又厚又白
As thick and white as New England snow.

994
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:24,073
现在 我的黑奴们回来了
Now, my niggers is returned to me.

995
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:31,084
听说特纳法官给了你点好处
Heard Judge Turner gave you favor.

996
01:27:35,083 --> 01:27:39,509
普莱特 你是不是把他也骗了 用你惯用的伎俩?
Did you beguile him, Platt, with your slick nigger ways?

997
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:44,935
小子 在我的地盘
You won't stand idle, boy.

998
01:27:45,385 --> 01:27:47,353
你不会有这闲工夫的 
Not on my land.

999
01:27:50,182 --> 01:27:51,900
活多得干不完!
Much work to do!

1000
01:27:54,019 --> 01:27:57,023
日子又开始变得漫长 对吗?
Days of old long since, huh?

1001
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:05,447
开心吧
Joyous.

1002
01:28:05,614 --> 01:28:08,914
很开心吧 肯定的! 呜哇!
Joyous, indeed! Whoo!

1003
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:12,971
我们去给你找点甜点吧 怎么样?
Let's go find something sweet for you. Hmm?

1004
01:28:12,996 --> 01:28:14,168
嗯
Mmm-hmm.

1005
01:28:15,832 --> 01:28:16,628
糖果
Candy.

1006
01:28:16,792 --> 01:28:18,009
想吃糖果?
Candy?

1007
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:21,422
# 噢 摘棉花 #
# Oh, pick this cotton #

1008
01:28:21,588 --> 01:28:22,606
# 摘棉花 #
# Pick this cotton #

1009
01:28:22,631 --> 01:28:24,929
# 噢 摘棉花 #
# Oh, pick this cotton #

1010
01:28:25,091 --> 01:28:27,219
# 噢 摘棉花 #
# Oh, pick that cotton #

1011
01:28:27,385 --> 01:28:29,137
# 主人一点都不吝啬 伙计们 #
# Man ain't mean, boys #

1012
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:30,851
# 主人一点都不吝啬 伙计们 #
# Man ain't mean, boys #

1013
01:28:31,014 --> 01:28:33,016
# 主人一点都不吝啬 伙计们 #
# Man ain't mean, boys #

1014
01:28:33,183 --> 01:28:34,275
# 主人一点都不吝啬 # 
# Man ain't mean #

1015
01:28:34,434 --> 01:28:36,903
# 噢 摘棉花 #
# Oh, work this cotton #

1016
01:28:37,062 --> 01:28:38,063
# 摘棉花 #
# Work this cotton #

1017
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:40,983
# 噢 摘棉花 #
# Oh, work this cotton #

1018
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:42,275
# 摘棉花 #
# Work this cotton #

1019
01:28:42,442 --> 01:28:45,036
# 噢 干活一点都不累 伙计们 #
# Oh, work ain't hard, boys #

1020
01:28:45,529 --> 01:28:46,530
乔治
George.

1021
01:28:46,696 --> 01:28:48,448
摘了180磅
180 pounds.

1022
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:50,208
派茜
Patsey.

1023
01:28:50,367 --> 01:28:52,790
派茜摘了520磅
520 pounds for Patsey.

1024
01:28:52,953 --> 01:28:55,752
好姑娘 从不让我失望
That's my girl. Don't ever let me down.

1025
01:28:56,081 --> 01:28:57,298
普莱特呢?
Platt?

1026
01:28:57,457 --> 01:28:59,710
160磅
160 pounds.

1027
01:29:01,461 --> 01:29:03,054
阿姆斯比?
Armsby?

1028
01:29:03,588 --> 01:29:05,511
64磅
64 pounds.

1029
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:12,313
干得好的话 平均下来每人能摘200磅
A good day's labor would average 200 pounds.

1030
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:13,849
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

1031
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:21,239
我相信过不了多久 你就会上手的
I'm sure in time, you'll develop as a picker.

1032
01:29:21,648 --> 01:29:23,650
但这需要努力
But it takes effort, boy.

1033
01:29:25,193 --> 01:29:27,321
用点心
Put some damn effort into it.

1034
01:29:27,487 --> 01:29:28,158
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

1035
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:30,415
带他们出去 挨鞭子吧
Take them out, get to whipping.

1036
01:29:36,913 --> 01:29:38,961
真是个悲剧
It's a tragedy.

1037
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:41,835
这一切怎么会发生?
How does such come to pass?

1038
01:29:42,836 --> 01:29:46,056
卑贱地在地里干活 采摘棉花
Working a field and picking cotton like a lowly hand.

1039
01:29:46,590 --> 01:29:48,968
我的地位也就高那么一点点 
I'm of a damn sight better station.

1040
01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:52,104
你知道 我是个监工
I worked as an overseer, you know.

1041
01:29:52,262 --> 01:29:53,684
我不知道 先生
I did not know, sir.

1042
01:29:53,847 --> 01:29:55,349
别用"先生"
Not "sir."

1043
01:29:56,016 --> 01:29:57,859
喊我"阿姆斯比"
Just "Armsby."

1044
01:29:58,727 --> 01:30:00,900
我欠他的 不比你们中的任何一人多
I'm not owed more than any other in the field.

1045
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:04,032
那你怎么会来这里的 如果你不介意我这么问?
How did you arrive at such a place, if I may ask?

1046
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:07,035
别这么正式 我们只是聊聊天而已
Ask, it's just conversation.

1047
01:30:09,154 --> 01:30:12,124
我那会有点嗜酒...
I became a little too dependent on the whiskey...

1048
01:30:12,282 --> 01:30:14,751
对工作很不上心
a little too undependable on the job.

1049
01:30:15,994 --> 01:30:18,793
听着 在你骂我酒鬼之前...
Now, before you say I'm just a sorry drunkard...

1050
01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:21,083
让我把话讲完
let me state my case.

1051
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,128
像监工这种稳定的活
As reliable employment as overseeing is,

1052
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:26,346
其实是对精神上的折磨
it is no easy chore on the spirit.

1053
01:30:27,172 --> 01:30:30,016
我的意思是 任何一个有良知的人...
I say, no man of conscious...

1054
01:30:30,175 --> 01:30:32,644
都会因天天抽打他人...
can take the lash to another human day in and day out...

1055
01:30:32,802 --> 01:30:35,180
使得自己内心饱受折磨
without shredding at his own self.

1056
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:38,354
时间久了...
Takes him to a place...

1057
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:43,022
他要么为了保持心智 不断为自己找借口...
where he either makes excuses within his mind to be unaffected...

1058
01:30:43,521 --> 01:30:46,866
要么寻求某种方式惩罚自己的罪孽
or he finds some way to trample his guilty sensations.

1059
01:30:47,776 --> 01:30:49,369
所以 我选择惩罚自己
So, I trampled.

1060
01:30:49,527 --> 01:30:51,450
不断地惩罚
With frequency.

1061
01:30:52,989 --> 01:30:56,118
我沉迷于财富的传说
I gave in to tales of wealth and prosperity.

1062
01:30:59,371 --> 01:31:03,877
但高额的利润却都涌进种植园主人们的口袋里
But such profitable outcomes are reserved for plantation masters.

1063
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:07,675
而我们其余的人只能任劳任怨
It's the lot of the rest of us to serve.

1064
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:14,679
现在 我只想拿份体面地收入然后回家
Now, all I want is to earn a decent wage and get myself home.

1065
01:31:46,876 --> 01:31:48,970
我日复一日的劳作
The proceeds of my fiddling performances.

1066
01:31:49,796 --> 01:31:53,926
只挣了这么一点 但这是我的所有了
Just a few picayunes, but all I have in the world.

1067
01:31:54,551 --> 01:31:57,930
如果你能帮帮我 我就把这些全部都给你
I promise them to you if you will do me the favor I require.

1068
01:31:58,096 --> 01:32:02,146
但我请求你 如果你做不到 不要把我供出来 
But I beg you not to expose me if you cannot grant the request.

1069
01:32:02,684 --> 01:32:03,776
嗯...
Uh...

1070
01:32:04,477 --> 01:32:06,104
你想要我做什么?
What is it you ask?

1071
01:32:06,271 --> 01:32:08,444
首先 你得保证 先生
First, your word, sir.

1072
01:32:09,149 --> 01:32:10,150
我以我的名誉担保
On my honor.

1073
01:32:12,277 --> 01:32:14,279
我的请求很简单
It's a simple enough request.

1074
01:32:15,655 --> 01:32:17,453
我只需要你去一趟马克思维的邮局
I only ask that you deposit a letter

1075
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:19,326
帮我寄一封信...
at the post office in Marksville...

1076
01:32:19,492 --> 01:32:22,962
然后永远保守这个秘密
and that you keep the action an inviolable secret forever.

1077
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:28,635
先生 请庇护我
A patron is what I require, sir.

1078
01:32:35,175 --> 01:32:36,017
我会的
I'll do it.

1079
01:32:37,135 --> 01:32:39,558
我会接受你给我的报酬 无论多少
And I'll accept whatever payment's offered.

1080
01:32:42,307 --> 01:32:44,856
为了帮你 我让自己陷于危险之中
To assist you, I put my own self at risk.

1081
01:32:45,643 --> 01:32:47,486
但我还会这么做...
I will do so...

1082
01:32:47,645 --> 01:32:50,819
只要求有些合理的补偿
but fair compensation is all I ask.

1083
01:33:00,325 --> 01:33:02,248
写好你的信
Draw up your letter.

1084
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:04,879
我们两天后见?
We'll meet again in two days?

1085
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:08,379
好 两天后
In two days.

1086
01:33:11,169 --> 01:33:12,671
谢谢
Thank you.

1087
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:32,088
听着 伙计...
Well, boy...

1088
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:37,097
我听说我有个识字的黑奴 他不但会写信
I understand I got a learned nigger that writes letters.

1089
01:34:38,173 --> 01:34:41,268
还想找个白人帮他寄信来着
Tries to get white fellas to mail them.

1090
01:34:47,599 --> 01:34:50,273
阿姆斯比今天告诉我的...
Armsby told me today...

1091
01:34:50,435 --> 01:34:52,938
魔鬼在我的黑奴中作祟
the devil was among my niggers.

1092
01:34:54,606 --> 01:34:57,576
我尤其需要盯着其中的某位...
That I had one that needed watching...

1093
01:34:57,734 --> 01:35:00,078
不然他就会逃跑
or he would run away.

1094
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:03,907
我问他为什么...
When I asked him why...

1095
01:35:04,782 --> 01:35:08,286
他告诉我你去找他...
he said you come over to him...

1096
01:35:08,453 --> 01:35:11,297
半夜把他叫醒...
waked him up in the middle of the night...

1097
01:35:11,456 --> 01:35:14,130
求他去马克思维那边...
and wanted him to carry a letter...

1098
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:17,128
帮你寄封信
to Marksville.

1099
01:35:22,217 --> 01:35:24,640
你有什么想说的?
What do you got to say to that?

1100
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:29,228
这不是真的
There's no truth to it.

1101
01:35:30,141 --> 01:35:31,643
你接着说
You say.

1102
01:35:33,311 --> 01:35:36,110
没有纸和墨水 我怎么写信?
How could I write a letter without ink or paper?

1103
01:35:37,273 --> 01:35:40,777
我给谁写信? 据我所知 我在这世上的朋友所剩无几了
Who am I gonna write to? I got no friends living as I know of.

1104
01:35:41,903 --> 01:35:43,576
那个叫阿姆斯比的家伙...
That Armsby...

1105
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:48,493
他是个谎话连篇的酒鬼
That Armsby is a lying, drunken fellow.

1106
01:35:50,328 --> 01:35:53,252
他是不是想让你雇他做监工?
Didn't he want you to hire him as an overseer?

1107
01:35:55,124 --> 01:35:56,751
这就说得清了
Well, that's it.

1108
01:35:58,127 --> 01:36:00,328
他想让你相信我们都会逃跑...
He wants to make you believe we're all gonna run away...

1109
01:36:00,338 --> 01:36:02,841
这样你就会雇佣他
so you'll hire him as an overseer.

1110
01:36:04,259 --> 01:36:06,728
他觉得你是个偏听偏信的人
He believes you're a soft soap.

1111
01:36:07,595 --> 01:36:10,064
所以他才会瞎编乱造
And he's given to such talk.

1112
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:14,690
凭空捏造一个故事...
Made this story out of whole cloth...

1113
01:36:15,228 --> 01:36:17,572
为了达到自己的目的
because he wants a situation.

1114
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:25,409
主人 这全是假的
It's all a lie, Master.

1115
01:36:30,868 --> 01:36:32,870
都是谎话
It's all a lie.

1116
01:36:41,045 --> 01:36:43,047
真见鬼
I'll be damned.

1117
01:36:49,095 --> 01:36:51,848
普莱特 要不是因为他是个自由的白人
Were he not free and white, Platt.

1118
01:36:53,891 --> 01:36:56,269
自由的白人
Were he not free and white.

1119
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:16,274
# 太阳会在这里落山 #
# Sun gonna set here #

1120
01:38:16,432 --> 01:38:18,184
# 在山那边 #
# Under the mountain #

1121
01:38:18,351 --> 01:38:20,399
# 太阳会在这里落山 #
# Sun gonna set here #

1122
01:38:20,561 --> 01:38:22,279
# 在山那边 #
# Under the mountain #

1123
01:38:22,438 --> 01:38:24,315
# 太阳会在这里落山 #
# Sun gonna set here #

1124
01:38:24,482 --> 01:38:26,450
# 在山那边 #
# Under the mountain #

1125
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:29,078
爱德华!
Edward!

1126
01:38:29,237 --> 01:38:30,864
往他身上浇点水
Get him water.

1127
01:38:38,204 --> 01:38:39,672
快起来!
Get up!

1128
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:41,833
快起来
Get up!

1129
01:38:48,506 --> 01:38:49,883
黑鬼 起来!
Nigger, get up!

1130
01:38:56,013 --> 01:38:58,266
伙计 你看什么呢?
What you looking at, boy?

1131
01:38:59,559 --> 01:39:01,687
继续干活 伙计!
Keep picking, boy!

1132
01:39:14,615 --> 01:39:18,210
我想说点关于艾布拉姆叔叔的事
I just wanna say something about Uncle Abram.

1133
01:39:22,457 --> 01:39:24,551
他是个好人...
He was a good man...

1134
01:39:24,876 --> 01:39:28,130
自从我们很小的时候 他就经常照顾我们
and he always looked out for us ever since we were little.

1135
01:39:28,921 --> 01:39:30,548
愿上帝爱他
God love him.

1136
01:39:31,215 --> 01:39:33,809
保佑他 关照他
God bless him. God keep him.

1137
01:39:34,886 --> 01:39:36,263
阿门
Amen.

1138
01:39:51,569 --> 01:39:54,948
# 去约旦河吧 #
# Went down to the River Jordan #

1139
01:39:55,114 --> 01:39:58,288
# 在那里 约翰曾为三个人施洗 #
# Where John baptized three #

1140
01:39:58,451 --> 01:40:01,455
# 当我唤醒来自地狱的恶魔时 #
# When I woke the devil in hell #

1141
01:40:01,621 --> 01:40:04,420
# 我告诉他是约翰为我施洗的 #
# Said Johnny baptized me #

1142
01:40:04,582 --> 01:40:08,086
# 流动吧 约旦河 流动吧 #
# I said roll, Jordan, roll #

1143
01:40:08,586 --> 01:40:11,089
# 流动吧 约旦河 流动吧 #
# Roll, Jordan, roll #

1144
01:40:11,255 --> 01:40:14,259
# 主啊 我的灵魂会升入天堂 #
# My soul will rise in heaven, Lord #

1145
01:40:14,425 --> 01:40:16,974
# 只要约旦河还在流动 #
# For the year when Jordan roll #

1146
01:40:17,136 --> 01:40:20,515
# 有些人说约翰是施洗者 #
# Well, some say John was a Baptist #

1147
01:40:20,681 --> 01:40:23,275
# 有些人说约翰是犹太人 #
# Some say John was a Jew #

1148
01:40:23,434 --> 01:40:25,812
# 但我说约翰是一名牧师 #
# But I say John was a preacher #

1149
01:40:25,978 --> 01:40:28,948
# 因为圣经上也这么写着的 #
# 'Cause my Bible says so too #

1150
01:40:29,106 --> 01:40:32,610
# 流动吧 约旦河 流动吧 #
# I said roll, Jordan, roll #

1151
01:40:32,777 --> 01:40:35,280
# 流动吧 约旦河 流动吧 #
# Roll, Jordan, roll #

1152
01:40:35,446 --> 01:40:38,450
# 主啊 我的灵魂会升入天堂 #
# My soul will rise in heaven, Lord #

1153
01:40:38,616 --> 01:40:40,368
# 只要约旦河还在流动 #
# For the year when Jordan roll #

1154
01:40:40,535 --> 01:40:41,957
# 哈利路亚 #
# Hallelujah #

1155
01:40:42,119 --> 01:40:47,626
# 流动吧 约旦河 流动吧 #
# Roll, Jordan, roll #

1156
01:40:47,792 --> 01:40:50,841
# 主啊 我的灵魂会升入天堂 #
# My soul will rise in heaven, Lord #

1157
01:40:51,003 --> 01:40:52,846
# 只要约旦河还在流动 #
# For the year when Jordan roll #

1158
01:40:53,005 --> 01:40:54,222
# 哈利路亚 #
# Hallelujah #

1159
01:40:54,382 --> 01:41:00,139
# 流动吧 约旦河 流动吧 #
# Roll, Jordan, roll #

1160
01:41:00,304 --> 01:41:03,353
# 主啊 我的灵魂会升入天堂 #
# My soul will rise in heaven, Lord #

1161
01:41:03,516 --> 01:41:05,518
# 只要约旦河还在流动 #
# For the year when Jordan roll #

1162
01:41:05,685 --> 01:41:07,028
# 大家一起唱 #
# Everybody say #

1163
01:41:07,186 --> 01:41:12,659
# 流动吧 约旦河 流动吧 #
# Roll, Jordan, roll #

1164
01:41:12,817 --> 01:41:15,821
# 主啊 我的灵魂会升入天堂 #
# My soul will rise in heaven, Lord #

1165
01:41:15,987 --> 01:41:17,864
# 只要约旦河还在流动 #
# For the year when Jordan roll #

1166
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:19,156
# 噢 孩子们 #
# Oh, children #

1167
01:41:19,323 --> 01:41:24,750
# 流动吧 约旦河 流动吧 #
# Roll, Jordan, roll #

1168
01:41:24,912 --> 01:41:27,836
# 主啊 我的灵魂会升入天堂 #
# My soul will rise in heaven, Lord #

1169
01:41:27,999 --> 01:41:29,751
# 只要约旦河还在流动 #
# For the year when Jordan roll #

1170
01:41:29,917 --> 01:41:31,260
# 哈利路亚 #
# Hallelujah #

1171
01:41:31,419 --> 01:41:36,846
# 流动吧 约旦河 流动吧 #
# Roll, Jordan, roll #

1172
01:41:37,008 --> 01:41:39,887
# 主啊 我的灵魂会升入天堂 #
# My soul will rise in heaven, Lord #

1173
01:41:40,052 --> 01:41:42,521
# 只要约旦河还在流动 #
# For the year when Jordan roll #

1174
01:42:02,366 --> 01:42:04,118
放到最边上
Right to the end.

1175
01:42:12,627 --> 01:42:14,174
嘿 巴斯
Hey, Bass.

1176
01:42:15,087 --> 01:42:16,555
噢 不用了 不了
Oh, no, no, no.

1177
01:42:16,714 --> 01:42:19,183
大热天的休息会儿没什么
No shame in taking respite from the heat.

1178
01:42:19,342 --> 01:42:21,060
喝点酒 乘会凉
Drink, shade.

1179
01:42:21,218 --> 01:42:23,863
对旅行者来说有点大逆不道 对朋友来讲就要另当别论了
It's ungodly for travelers, hearty or otherwise.

1180
01:42:28,893 --> 01:42:29,985
笑什么?
What's funny?

1181
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:33,865
艾普斯 我只是想按要求把手上的活干完
Epps, I merely mean to finish the work at hand, as requested.

1182
01:42:34,023 --> 01:42:35,821
获得酬劳
And as paid for.

1183
01:42:35,983 --> 01:42:37,781
如果有什么让你觉得不舒服...
If something rubs you wrongly...

1184
01:42:37,943 --> 01:42:40,867
我给你个机会说出来
I offer you the opportunity to speak on it.

1185
01:42:44,116 --> 01:42:46,744
你既然问了 那我不妨直说吧
You ask plainly, so I will tell you plainly.

1186
01:42:47,536 --> 01:42:51,757
我觉得好笑的是 大热天的 您只顾关心我的身体状况...
What amused me just then was your concern for my well-being in this heat...

1187
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:54,969
而同时 坦白的说 您工人的状况...
when, quite frankly, the condition of your laborers...

1188
01:42:55,127 --> 01:42:56,395
"我工人的状况"?
"The condition of my laborers"?

1189
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:58,422
他们的状况很糟糕 糟透了
It is horrid. It's all wrong.

1190
01:42:58,589 --> 01:42:59,841
糟透了 艾普斯先生
All wrong, Mr. Epps.

1191
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:02,260
他们不是雇来帮忙的
They ain't hired help.

1192
01:43:02,426 --> 01:43:03,473
他们是我的资产
They're my property.

1193
01:43:04,303 --> 01:43:05,304
你的语气很骄傲
You say that with pride.

1194
01:43:05,471 --> 01:43:07,144
我说的是事实
I say it as fact.

1195
01:43:09,225 --> 01:43:11,899
如果非要聊聊哪些是事实
If this conversation concerns what is factual

1196
01:43:12,019 --> 01:43:14,693
哪些不是 那么我觉得我有必要说出来...
and what is not, then it must be said...

1197
01:43:14,855 --> 01:43:17,984
对于奴隶来说 没什么公平或者权利可言
that there is no justice nor righteousness in their slavery.

1198
01:43:18,818 --> 01:43:20,946
不过你确实提出了一个很有意思的问题
But you do open up an interesting question.

1199
01:43:22,113 --> 01:43:23,535
如果把问题归结为一点
What right have you to your niggers,

1200
01:43:23,656 --> 01:43:25,033
你究竟对你的黑奴们有什么权利呢?
when you come down to the point?

1201
01:43:25,449 --> 01:43:26,746
- 什么权利?  - 嗯
- What right?  - Mmm.

1202
01:43:27,368 --> 01:43:30,212
我买下他们 花钱买的
I bought them. I paid for them.

1203
01:43:30,579 --> 01:43:32,331
一点没错 而且法律明确规定
Of course you did, and the law says

1204
01:43:32,456 --> 01:43:34,254
你有权拥有黑奴
you have the right to hold a nigger.

1205
01:43:34,417 --> 01:43:36,385
恕我对法律的不敬 它说谎了
But begging the law's pardon, it lies.

1206
01:43:37,002 --> 01:43:39,050
如果颁布一条法令 剥夺你的自由
Suppose they pass a law taking away

1207
01:43:39,171 --> 01:43:41,219
让你成为奴隶
your liberty, making you a slave.

1208
01:43:41,382 --> 01:43:42,508
我是说如果
Suppose.

1209
01:43:42,675 --> 01:43:44,302
这种事不可能发生
That ain't a supposable case.

1210
01:43:44,468 --> 01:43:45,890
法律是会变的 艾普斯
Laws change, Epps.

1211
01:43:46,053 --> 01:43:48,147
普遍的真理才是永恒的
Universal truths are constant.

1212
01:43:48,305 --> 01:43:51,149
这是个事实 一个直白而简单的事实...
It is a fact, a plain and simple fact...

1213
01:43:51,308 --> 01:43:54,528
真相和权利对所有人来说都是一样的
that what is true and right is true and right for all.

1214
01:43:54,687 --> 01:43:56,689
对黑人和白人都是一样的
White and black alike.

1215
01:43:58,315 --> 01:44:00,158
巴斯 你拿我和黑鬼比?
You comparing me to a nigger, Bass?

1216
01:44:00,317 --> 01:44:03,161
我只是问问 在上帝眼里 我们和他们又有什么区别呢?
I'm only asking, in the eyes of God, what is the difference?

1217
01:44:05,156 --> 01:44:06,924
你也可以问问
You might as well ask what the difference is

1218
01:44:06,949 --> 01:44:09,327
白人和狒狒有什么区别
between a white man and a baboon.

1219
01:44:10,536 --> 01:44:13,335
我在奥尔良见过这种小动物
I seen one of them critters in Orleans.

1220
01:44:13,497 --> 01:44:15,875
他们懂得就和我的黑奴们一样多
Know just as much as any nigger I got.

1221
01:44:16,167 --> 01:44:17,840
听着 艾普斯
Listen, Epps.

1222
01:44:18,002 --> 01:44:19,675
这些黑奴们是人
These niggers are human beings.

1223
01:44:19,837 --> 01:44:22,197
如果他们无权活得比野蛮的动物好...
If they are allowed to climb no higher than brute animals...

1224
01:44:22,339 --> 01:44:25,013
你和像你一样的奴隶主们要为此负责
you and men like you will have to answer for it.

1225
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:28,183
这是一种病态的社会现象 艾普斯先生...
There is an ill, Mr. Epps...

1226
01:44:28,345 --> 01:44:30,723
国内非常恐怖的病态现象
a fearful ill resting upon this nation.

1227
01:44:31,348 --> 01:44:34,352
早晚有一天这个国家会觉醒的
And there will be a day of reckoning yet.

1228
01:44:36,937 --> 01:44:39,611
巴斯 你比我认识的任何人...
You like to hear yourself talk, Bass...

1229
01:44:39,774 --> 01:44:41,868
更喜欢闭门造车
better than any man I know of.

1230
01:44:42,943 --> 01:44:46,618
如果有人要否定你...
You'd argue that black was white, or white, black...

1231
01:44:46,781 --> 01:44:49,034
你就会辩论说什么黑人白人都是一样的
if anybody would contradict you.

1232
01:44:51,035 --> 01:44:54,414
当然如果你住在美国东北部会很好多
A fine supposition if you lived among Yankees in New England.

1233
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:56,253
可你不住那边
But you don't.

1234
01:44:59,710 --> 01:45:01,883
你肯定也去不了
You most assuredly do not.

1235
01:45:27,404 --> 01:45:29,782
我就知道 我就知道!
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!

1236
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:33,581
派茜!
Patsey!

1237
01:45:35,579 --> 01:45:36,956
小茜!
Pats!

1238
01:45:37,665 --> 01:45:39,087
她人呢?
Where is she?

1239
01:45:39,834 --> 01:45:41,256
小茜去哪了?
Where's Pats?

1240
01:45:41,418 --> 01:45:43,762
她在哪 该死的? 她人呢?
Where is she, damn it? Where is she?

1241
01:45:45,714 --> 01:45:48,593
菲比 她在哪? 派茜去哪了? 她在哪?
Phebs, where is she? Where is Patsey? Where is she?

1242
01:45:48,759 --> 01:45:50,056
你站在那里干什么?
What you standing there for?

1243
01:45:50,219 --> 01:45:51,459
我们对她一无所知 主人
We know nothing of her, Master.

1244
01:45:51,470 --> 01:45:52,892
- 对什么一无所知?  - 我们什么都不知道...
- Know nothing of what?  - We know nothing of...

1245
01:45:53,055 --> 01:45:55,433
不知道什么? 她去哪了?
Of what? Where has she gone?

1246
01:45:55,599 --> 01:45:56,600
她逃跑了 是吗?
She run off, ain't she?

1247
01:45:56,767 --> 01:45:57,768
我不知道 主人
I don't know, Master.

1248
01:45:57,935 --> 01:45:59,482
- 她在哪?  - 我不知道 主人
- Where is she?  - I don't know, Master.

1249
01:45:59,645 --> 01:46:02,615
你知道 你知道!
You know, you know, you know!

1250
01:46:02,773 --> 01:46:03,615
你知道!
You know!

1251
01:46:03,774 --> 01:46:05,447
不 我不知道!
No, I don't!

1252
01:46:07,611 --> 01:46:09,659
你们这些可怜的黑狗
You miserable black dogs.

1253
01:46:09,822 --> 01:46:12,291
你们个个都像是又聋又哑似的站在那儿
You stand like the deaf and dumb.

1254
01:46:14,076 --> 01:46:15,453
说话!
Speak!

1255
01:46:30,634 --> 01:46:32,307
她走了
She gone.

1256
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:36,648
我的小茜走了
My Pats is gone.

1257
01:46:53,532 --> 01:46:55,500
逃跑? 你逃跑了 对吗?
Run off? Run off, did you?

1258
01:46:55,659 --> 01:46:57,659
- 艾普斯老爷...  - 你这个可怜的姑娘 你去哪了?
- Master Epps...  - You miserable wench. Where you been?

1259
01:46:57,786 --> 01:46:59,163
我哪也没去!
I been nowhere!

1260
01:46:59,330 --> 01:47:00,422
证据确凿你还不承认!
Lies to your misdeeds!

1261
01:47:00,581 --> 01:47:01,932
今天是安息日 老爷 我去
The Sabbath day, Master. I took me

1262
01:47:01,957 --> 01:47:03,309
散步了 去和上帝谈心了
a walk to commune with the Lord.

1263
01:47:03,334 --> 01:47:04,768
还把上帝扯进你的鬼话?
Bring the Lord into your deceptions?

1264
01:47:04,793 --> 01:47:06,270
你是从肖的种植园过来的
You're coming from Shaw's plantation.

1265
01:47:06,295 --> 01:47:07,592
- 不!  - 艾普斯老爷
- No!  - Master Epps.

1266
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:09,131
现在你想说话了?
Now, you speak?

1267
01:47:09,298 --> 01:47:11,346
现在你想和她一起说谎 你知道开口了!
Now that you want to add to her lies, you find your tongue!

1268
01:47:11,508 --> 01:47:13,819
我去了肖老爷的种植园
I went to Master Shaw's plantation.

1269
01:47:13,844 --> 01:47:15,346
啊! 你承认了
Ah! You admit it.

1270
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:16,976
是的 我承认
Yes, freely.

1271
01:47:17,139 --> 01:47:18,982
但你知道为什么吗?
And you know why?

1272
01:47:19,141 --> 01:47:21,690
我从肖夫人那得到了这个
I got this from Mistress Shaw.

1273
01:47:22,186 --> 01:47:26,191
艾普斯夫人甚至不会给我一块肥皂让我用来清洁
Mistress Epps won't even grant me no soap to clean with.

1274
01:47:26,774 --> 01:47:30,369
我太臭了 我自己都忍不住想吐!
I stink so much, I make myself gag!

1275
01:47:33,614 --> 01:47:36,868
500磅的棉花
500 pounds of cotton.

1276
01:47:37,034 --> 01:47:39,036
日复一日!
Day in, day out!

1277
01:47:39,203 --> 01:47:41,046
比这的任何一个男人都多
More than any man here.

1278
01:47:41,205 --> 01:47:43,299
有了这个 我会变得干净
And for that, I will be clean.

1279
01:47:43,457 --> 01:47:45,175
这就是我唯一的要求
That's all I ask.

1280
01:47:45,334 --> 01:47:48,383
我会去肖老爷的种植园就是为了这个
This, here, what I went to Shaw's for.

1281
01:47:49,838 --> 01:47:50,885
骗子
Liar.

1282
01:47:51,048 --> 01:47:54,643
上帝见证 真的是这样!
The Lord knows that's all!

1283
01:47:54,802 --> 01:47:55,724
你是个骗子
You're a liar.

1284
01:47:55,886 --> 01:47:59,311
而你 被你自己的贪婪蒙蔽!
And you, blind with your own covetousness!

1285
01:48:00,182 --> 01:48:02,310
我没有说谎 主人
I don't lie, Master.

1286
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:06,064
如果你要杀了我 我也会坚持这么说
If you kill me, I'll stick to that.

1287
01:48:06,814 --> 01:48:08,407
看来我得好好教训你一顿
I'll fetch you down.

1288
01:48:09,233 --> 01:48:11,281
让你知道去肖那里的下场
I'll learn you to go to Shaw's.

1289
01:48:11,735 --> 01:48:12,827
特里奇
Treach.

1290
01:48:14,863 --> 01:48:16,365
去取绳子来
Run and fetch some line.

1291
01:48:16,532 --> 01:48:17,704
爱德华!
Edward!

1292
01:48:19,326 --> 01:48:22,330
把她衣服扒了 绑到树桩上给我狠狠地打
Strip her. Strike her bare and lash her to the post.

1293
01:48:40,764 --> 01:48:42,908
这是你自找的 小茜
You done this to yourself, Pats.

1294
01:48:54,611 --> 01:48:55,783
打啊
Do it.

1295
01:49:00,868 --> 01:49:03,087
把她往死里打
Strike the life from her.

1296
01:49:09,293 --> 01:49:10,715
你来打
Beat her.

1297
01:49:12,337 --> 01:49:14,590
让她尝尝鞭子的味道! 让她如愿以偿!
Give her the whip! Give it all to her!

1298
01:49:15,883 --> 01:49:18,853
普莱特 你过来 现在你来打她
Platt, you come here and you beat her now.

1299
01:49:21,305 --> 01:49:22,397
普莱特!
Platt!

1300
01:49:25,184 --> 01:49:26,436
过来!
Come here!

1301
01:49:28,187 --> 01:49:30,360
我宁愿由你来打 普莱特!
I'd rather it you, Platt!

1302
01:49:31,315 --> 01:49:33,067
你来打她
You strike her.

1303
01:49:33,942 --> 01:49:35,364
打她啊
Strike her.

1304
01:49:57,674 --> 01:49:59,267
他就没用劲
He pantomimes.

1305
01:49:59,885 --> 01:50:02,308
她身上几乎没有鞭痕
There's barely a welt on her.

1306
01:50:02,763 --> 01:50:05,141
这就是你的黑鬼...
That's what your niggers make of you...

1307
01:50:05,307 --> 01:50:07,480
把你当傻子一样愚弄
a fool for the taking.

1308
01:50:11,980 --> 01:50:14,403
打她 普莱特 打她啊!
Strike her, Platt. Strike her!

1309
01:50:31,125 --> 01:50:32,547
你给我好好地打
You will strike her.

1310
01:50:32,709 --> 01:50:34,427
你要打得她皮开肉绽
You will strike her until her flesh

1311
01:50:34,545 --> 01:50:36,263
血肉模糊...
is rent and meat and blood flow equal...

1312
01:50:36,421 --> 01:50:39,220
否则我看见一个黑奴 就杀一个
or I will kill every nigger in my sight.

1313
01:50:39,383 --> 01:50:40,885
你听懂了吗?
You understand me?

1314
01:50:41,051 --> 01:50:43,895
打她! 打她!
Strike her! Strike her!

1315
01:51:27,139 --> 01:51:29,938
我还没喊停呢 我说停你才能停!
Until I say no more. I ain't said nothing!

1316
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:41,157
把鞭子给我!
Give me the whip!

1317
01:51:42,154 --> 01:51:43,371
起来!
Get up!

1318
01:52:02,799 --> 01:52:04,472
你这个魔鬼!
Thou devil!

1319
01:52:07,012 --> 01:52:08,559
总有一天...
Sooner or later...

1320
01:52:09,223 --> 01:52:11,817
善有善报 恶有恶报
somewhere in the course of eternal

1321
01:52:11,975 --> 01:52:14,569
总有一天你会遭报应的!
justice, thou shalt answer for this sin!

1322
01:52:19,983 --> 01:52:23,032
报应? 根本不会有报应
Sin? There is no sin.

1323
01:52:24,488 --> 01:52:27,412
人可以对他的财产为所欲为
Man does how he pleases with his property.

1324
01:52:33,038 --> 01:52:36,759
现在 普莱特 我现在心情已经很嗨
At the moment, Platt, I'm of great pleasure.

1325
01:52:36,917 --> 01:52:38,760
你他妈给我小心点 
You be goddamn careful I don't want to

1326
01:52:38,877 --> 01:52:40,675
别再火上浇油
come and lighten my mood no further.

1327
01:54:58,975 --> 01:55:00,477
巴斯老爷
Master Bass.

1328
01:55:00,769 --> 01:55:03,943
请问您来自这个国家的哪个地方
I want to ask you what part of the country you come from.

1329
01:55:05,148 --> 01:55:07,025
我不是这个国家的
No part of this land.

1330
01:55:08,110 --> 01:55:10,158
我来自加拿大
I originate from Canada.

1331
01:55:11,154 --> 01:55:12,701
来 猜猜它在哪里
Now, guess where that is.

1332
01:55:12,864 --> 01:55:14,787
我知道加拿大在哪
I know where Canada is.

1333
01:55:15,617 --> 01:55:17,369
我自己去过那儿
I've been there myself.

1334
01:55:22,290 --> 01:55:24,133
蒙特利尔...
Montreal...

1335
01:55:24,292 --> 01:55:27,341
金斯顿 昆士顿 还有很多的地方
and Kingston and Queenston and a great many places.

1336
01:55:27,504 --> 01:55:29,347
对一个黑奴来说算阅历丰富了
Well-traveled for a slave.

1337
01:55:29,506 --> 01:55:30,553
你怎么来这的?
How came you here?

1338
01:55:32,634 --> 01:55:34,307
巴斯老爷...
Master Bass...

1339
01:55:36,638 --> 01:55:40,017
如果正义能够得以伸张 我怎么会到这来
if justice had been done, I never would have been here.

1340
01:55:44,813 --> 01:55:46,156
此话怎讲?
How's this?

1341
01:55:47,190 --> 01:55:48,237
告诉我
Tell me all.

1342
01:55:53,697 --> 01:55:55,870
我不敢告诉您
I'm afraid to tell you.

1343
01:55:57,534 --> 01:56:00,663
你所说的每一个字都会被严格保密
Every word you speak is a profound secret.

1344
01:56:08,211 --> 01:56:09,884
你的故事...
Your story...

1345
01:56:10,547 --> 01:56:12,015
真令人大吃一惊
it is amazing.

1346
01:56:12,174 --> 01:56:14,176
却很可悲
And in no good way.

1347
01:56:18,930 --> 01:56:22,560
您相信正义吗 先生 就像您所说的?
Do you believe, sir, in justice, as you said?

1348
01:56:23,727 --> 01:56:25,274
相信
I do.

1349
01:56:25,437 --> 01:56:29,237
您相信奴隶制是邪恶的并且应被彻底废除吗?
That slavery is an evil that should befall none?

1350
01:56:32,068 --> 01:56:33,866
我认为是的
I believe so.

1351
01:56:34,029 --> 01:56:35,952
若你真是如此...
If you truly do...

1352
01:56:37,741 --> 01:56:40,790
那么我请求你 我恳求你...
then I ask, I beg...

1353
01:56:43,455 --> 01:56:46,254
写封信给我在北方的朋友...
that you write my friends in the north...

1354
01:56:46,625 --> 01:56:49,424
让他们了解到我的处境...
acquainting them of my situation...

1355
01:56:50,795 --> 01:56:55,096
并且恳求他们证明我是自由的身份
and beseeching them to forward free papers.

1356
01:57:00,096 --> 01:57:01,769
重新见到我的妻子...
It would be...

1357
01:57:04,768 --> 01:57:07,612
和我的家人...
an unspeakable happiness...

1358
01:57:09,231 --> 01:57:11,279
那将是...
to see my wife...

1359
01:57:13,777 --> 01:57:16,075
无法言表的幸福
and my family again.

1360
01:57:21,952 --> 01:57:25,331
我来到这个国家20年了...
I traveled this country for the best part of 20 years...

1361
01:57:25,997 --> 01:57:28,921
我的自由就是一切
and my freedom is everything.

1362
01:57:29,084 --> 01:57:33,430
明天能离开这里 是我最高兴的事情
The fact that I can walk out of here tomorrow brings me great pleasure.

1363
01:57:36,049 --> 01:57:38,302
我的命对任何人都没有多大意义
My life doesn't mean much to anyone.

1364
01:57:39,636 --> 01:57:43,311
但看起来你的命对许多人都意义重大
It seems yours might mean a lot to a whole lot of people.

1365
01:57:45,058 --> 01:57:49,529
但是你的请求 令我害怕
But what you ask of me, sir, scares me.

1366
01:57:51,690 --> 01:57:54,534
我不得不说 我害怕
And I must say, I am afraid.

1367
01:57:55,652 --> 01:57:57,996
不仅仅是为你 还是为我
Not just for you, but for me.

1368
01:58:07,163 --> 01:58:09,336
我会为你写信的 先生
I will write your letter, sir.

1369
01:58:09,780 --> 01:58:11,101
而且如果它能为你带来自由
And if it brings you your freedom,

1370
01:58:11,126 --> 01:58:12,366
那不仅仅会是我的荣幸
it will be more than a pleasure.

1371
01:58:12,377 --> 01:58:14,345
那将会是我的责任
It will have been my duty.

1372
01:58:14,504 --> 01:58:17,508
现在 你可以把那些木片递给我吗?
Now, would you kindly hand me those shingles?

1373
02:00:52,078 --> 02:00:53,250
普莱特!
Platt!

1374
02:00:53,663 --> 02:00:55,711

1376
02:01:22,525 --> 02:01:24,277
你叫普莱特 对吗?

1377
02:01:26,070 --> 02:01:27,367
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

1378
02:01:28,031 --> 02:01:29,578
你认识那个人吗?
You know that man?

1379
02:01:47,383 --> 02:01:48,976
帕克先生
Mr. Parker.

1380
02:01:49,636 --> 02:01:51,138
再说一遍?
Say again?

1381
02:01:53,181 --> 02:01:55,024
帕克先生
Mr. Parker.

1382
02:01:55,475 --> 02:01:58,149
那位先生收到了一封充满着许多指控的信
That man received a letter compiling many accusations.

1383
02:01:58,311 --> 02:02:00,154
你看着我的眼睛...
You look me in the eye...

1384
02:02:00,814 --> 02:02:02,540
并且无论如何 请你如实地回答我
and on your life, you answer me truthfully.

1385
02:02:02,565 --> 02:02:04,238
除了普莱特你还有其他名字吗?
Have you any other name than Platt?

1386
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:06,402
所罗门・诺瑟普是我的名字
Solomon Northup is my name.

1387
02:02:06,569 --> 02:02:07,769
治安官 这是怎么回事?
Sheriff, what's all this?

1388
02:02:07,904 --> 02:02:09,281
这是公事
It's official business.

1389
02:02:09,447 --> 02:02:10,744
我的黑奴 就是我的事
My nigger, my business.

1390
02:02:10,907 --> 02:02:12,534
你的事可以等
Your business waits.

1391
02:02:12,700 --> 02:02:13,792
跟我说说你的家庭

1393
02:02:15,703 --> 02:02:16,579

1394

1396
02:02:19,916 --> 02:02:21,418
叫安妮・汉普顿 我就是你们要找的人
Anne Hampton. I am who I say.

1397
02:02:21,584 --> 02:02:22,585
你去哪 普莱特?
Where you going, Platt?

1398
02:02:23,461 --> 02:02:25,381
谁授权你干涉我的财产了?
Who authorized you to interfere with my property?

1399
02:02:25,505 --> 02:02:26,597
这是我的权力
My authority.

1400
02:02:26,756 --> 02:02:28,099
普莱特 你回来 普莱特!
Platt, you come back here. Platt!

1401

02:02:34,556 --> 02:02:36,979
你放开他 普莱特是我的黑奴!
You unhand him. Platt is my nigger!

1404
02:02:37,141 --> 02:02:38,563
他是所罗门・诺瑟普先生
He is Mr. Solomon Northup.

1405
02:02:38,726 --> 02:02:39,602
你瞎说
You say.

1406
02:02:39,769 --> 02:02:42,238
你到这儿来 和我不熟 还要来抢我的人
You come here, unfamiliar to me, and make claims.

1407
02:02:42,397 --> 02:02:44,123
毫无疑问 这位先生就是所罗门・诺瑟普
I got no doubts. The man is Solomon Northup.

1408
02:02:44,148 --> 02:02:46,492
他是个鬼! 他是我的黑奴 我会为他跟你死磕到底!
The hell he is! He's my nigger, and I'll fight you for him!

1409

你有你的权利
As is your right.

1410
02:02:48,111 --> 02:02:50,312
我也有我的权利 而且我也很乐意在法庭上让你倾家荡产
As it will be my pleasure to bankrupt you in the courts.

1411
02:02:50,446 --> 02:02:52,790
你自己决定 放开他
Your decision. Unhand him.

1412
02:02:53,573 --> 02:02:55,134
我知道这件事你也有份 普莱特
I know you had some hand in this, Platt.

1413
02:02:55,159 --> 02:02:56,627
我会弄个水落石出的
I'm gonna get to the bottom of it.

1414
02:02:56,786 --> 02:02:57,912
别理他
Pay him no mind.

1415
02:02:58,079 --> 02:02:59,456
我为这个黑奴付了大价钱
I paid good money for this nigger.

1416
02:02:59,581 --> 02:03:00,958
法院的文件可以证明这一点!
Courthouse got papers to prove it!

1417
02:03:01,124 --> 02:03:02,922
我们也有文件证明他是自由的!

1418
02:03:03,084 --> 02:03:04,802
你是我的 你是属于我的 你听见了吗 普莱特?

1419
02:03:04,961 --> 02:03:06,087
放开他!

我很快就会见到你的
I'm gonna be seeing you real soon.

1425
02:03:25,481 --> 02:03:27,449
所罗门 我们得快点

1426
02:03:29,152 --> 02:03:30,153
不
No.

1427
02:03:30,737 --> 02:03:32,080

1428
02:05:09,002 --> 02:05:11,175

1429
02:05:13,256 --> 02:05:15,258

02:05:17,844 --> 02:05:19,767
但过去的这些年里...
But I have had...

1431
02:05:20,722 --> 02:05:22,690
我经历了...
a difficult time...

1432
02:05:23,683 --> 02:05:26,402
一段艰难的岁月
these past several years.

1433
02:05:31,274 --> 02:05:32,617
玛格丽特
Margaret.

1434
02:05:38,197 --> 02:05:39,915
阿朗佐
Alonzo.

1435
02:06:11,064 --> 02:06:12,782
他是谁?
Who is this?

1436
02:06:13,816 --> 02:06:15,818
他是我的丈夫
He's my husband.

1437
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:18,492
丈夫
Husband.

1438
02:06:19,322 --> 02:06:22,667
很高兴见到你 先生
It is very good to meet you, sir.

1439
02:06:24,452 --> 02:06:26,671
我们还有很多需要互相了解
We have much acquainting to do.

1440
02:06:26,829 --> 02:06:28,172
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

1441
02:06:29,415 --> 02:06:33,465
然后这是你的外孙
And this is your grandson.

1442
02:06:34,295 --> 02:06:37,469
他叫所罗门・诺瑟普・斯汤顿
Solomon Northup Staunton.

1443
02:06:47,683 --> 02:06:49,276
所罗门
Solomon.

1444
02:06:55,525 --> 02:06:56,822
安妮...
Anne...

1445
02:06:59,195 --> 02:07:00,993
原谅我
forgive me.

1446
02:07:04,534 --> 02:07:08,038
没有什么要原谅的
There is nothing to forgive.

1447
02:07:30,134 --> 02:07:36,438
所罗门・诺瑟普是为数不多的
摆脱奴隶身份重获自由的绑架受害者之一

1448
02:07:37,634 --> 02:07:42,338
所罗门让拐卖他的人受到了审判


1449
02:07:43,934 --> 02:07:51,538
因为不能在国家首都对白人做出不利的证词
所罗门对奴隶主詹姆斯・伯奇的申诉失败

1450
02:07:52,134 --> 02:08:00,938
在纽约漫长的法律诉讼程序中 
拐卖他的两人 汉密尔顿和布朗也免于起诉

1451
02:08:02,134 --> 02:08:07,638
1853年 所罗门出版了小说"为奴十二年"


1452
02:08:08,834 --> 02:08:19,838
他投身于废奴运动
在美国东北地区到处做有关奴隶制的演讲

1453
02:08:21,034 --> 02:08:27,238
所罗门死于何时 何处 如何而死均是未知数
