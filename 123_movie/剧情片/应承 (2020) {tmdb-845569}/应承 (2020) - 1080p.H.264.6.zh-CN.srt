00:00:11,649 --> 00:00:13,097
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:13,185 --> 00:00:15,929
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Welcome to the class of College English IV.

3
00:00:15,969 --> 00:00:19,081
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Today, our topic is creativity.

4
00:00:19,313 --> 00:00:20,873
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}What is creativity?

5
00:00:20,801 --> 00:00:22,505
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}What can it bring to us?

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,746
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}How can we be creative?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,581
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Stay with me, and you will find the answer.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,377
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}First, let's talk about the question.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,500
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}What is creativity?

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,825
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}How do you understand it?

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,600
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Maybe, it's difficult for you to give a definition.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,281
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}But I believe some words will come to your mind.

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,377
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}So would you please tell me the words?

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,289
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}New ideas.  Yes.

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,770
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Ability.  Good.

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,377
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Eh, would you please?

17
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:53,500
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Invention.

18
00:00:53,589 --> 00:00:54,809
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}How about you?

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,900
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Original.  Good.

20
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,300
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Imagination. Quite good.

21
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,689
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Yeah. When it comes to creativity,

22
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,482
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Some words will flash in our minds.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,985
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}And actually I've consulted some materials

24
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,800
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}and found many people have tried

25
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,377
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}to give a definition of creativity.

26
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,700
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}But they have explained it in different ways.

27
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,369
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Yet generally speaking, creativity can be described as follows:

28
00:01:24,005 --> 00:01:30,153
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}It is a kind of ability based on imagination and inspiration.

29
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:35,625
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}It includes thinking up new ideas, producing new things,

30
00:01:36,457 --> 00:01:40,713
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}choosing new perspectives and adopting new solutions.

31
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:47,578
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}It is the source of creation, invention and innovation.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,329
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}So look, there are so many words related to creativity.

33
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,945
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}But I have connected them with words

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,987
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}like based on, includes and source.

35
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,657
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}So I hope you can do the job as I did,

36
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,745
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}so that you can have a better understanding of creativity.

37
00:02:06,818 --> 00:02:08,500
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Let's do it together.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,100
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Creativity is a kind of ability based on

39
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,100
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}imagination and inspiration. Good.

40
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,729
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}It includes thinking up new ideas, producing new things,

41
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,193
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}choosing new perspectives and adopting new solutions. Yes.

42
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:35,800
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}It is the source of creation, invention and innovation.

43
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,900
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Yeah. You did a good job. Very smart.

44
00:02:38,113 --> 00:02:41,545
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}And then, what can creativity bring to us?

45
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,700
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Maybe, it's a little bit difficult for you to answer this question.

46
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:48,700
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}So I'd like to show you some pictures.

47
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:50,905
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Let's look at the first one.

48
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:53,481
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}What is it?

49
00:02:54,585 --> 00:02:55,300
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}It's a chair.

50
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,857
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}But it can be folded and carried everywhere.

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,529
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}So, we can say creativity can make the life more convenient. Yes

52
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,025
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}And how about the second picture?

53
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:10,314
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}They are playing, right?

54
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:20,201
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Yeah. So creativity can make the life more interesting, colorful. Good.

55
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,073
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Or we can say rich, right? Yes, exactly.

56
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,474
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}How about the third one?

57
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,750
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Creativity makes the world more beautiful.

58
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:32,761
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Yes. You like it?

59
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,600
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Since creativity is so significant and important for our humanbeings,

60
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:42,425
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}so we should be creative, right? Yeah.

61
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,481
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}And the problem is how to be creative?

62
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,905
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}What should we do?

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,500
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Let's have a discussion.

64
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,393
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Try to come up with effective ways to be creative

65
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:54,281
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}as many as possible.

66
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,305
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Ok. Have a discussion with your partner or deskmate.

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,433
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Ok. Anyone would like to say something?

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,185
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Volunteers. Yeah, you please.

69
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,300
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}We should have curiosity

70
00:04:16,301 --> 00:04:18,969
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}and don't be afraid to make mistakes.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,113
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Don't be afraid of making mistakes and be curious.

72
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,857
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Good, good idea.

73
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,705
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Anyone else? Would you please?

74
00:04:28,713 --> 00:04:32,986
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Write down the ideas when some something flash in your mind.

75
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,700
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Yeah. Write down something or

76
00:04:35,701 --> 00:04:39,034
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}write down some ideas when they come to your mind. Right? Yes.

77
00:04:40,205 --> 00:04:42,889
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}How about others? Yeah, would you please?

78
00:04:43,105 --> 00:04:46,009
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}I think you should spend more time thinking

79
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,537
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}and observe the world more carefully.

80
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,500
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Yeah. Spend more time thinking

81
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:52,873
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}and observe the world carefully.

82
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,529
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Good. I will follow your suggestion.

83
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,121
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}And anyone else?

84
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,300
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Yeah, this boy.

85
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,700
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}I think we can do some crazy things.

86
00:05:04,701 --> 00:05:06,400
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}If you like sing,

87
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:08,585
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}you can sing in the shower.

88
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,200
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Yes. You are very creative, I think.

89
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:12,700
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Do some crazy things.

90
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:14,100
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Sing in the shower.

91
00:05:14,101 --> 00:05:15,993
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Do you often do that?

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,442
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Ok, yeah. Since you have told me your ideas or your ways to be creative,

93
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,745
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}I'd like to share my ideas with you.

94
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,200
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}In my opinion, to be creative,

95
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:30,457
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}we should be curious about the world.

96
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,521
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Learn to take risks.

97
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,673
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Be enthusiastic about life.

98
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:41,354
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Have positive attitude toward people and things around us.

99
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,169
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Think outside the box.

100
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:47,000
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}You know. Think outside the box means

101
00:05:47,001 --> 00:05:50,762
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}think in different ways. Understand? Yeah.

102
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,449
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}And then, imagine fully.

103
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,745
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}View from different perspectives.

104
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,457
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}And last but not least.

105
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,065
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Explore what interests us.

106
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,057
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}In other words, creativity involves the following words.

107
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,185
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Let's learn them together.

108
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,500
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}One two start

109
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:13,500
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Curiosity.

110
00:06:13,465 --> 00:06:14,801
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Risks.

111
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,000
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Enthusiasm.

112
00:06:16,873 --> 00:06:18,217
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Attitude.

113
00:06:18,793 --> 00:06:19,417
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Thought.

114
00:06:19,866 --> 00:06:20,761
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Imagination.

115
00:06:21,435 --> 00:06:22,121
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Vision.

116
00:06:22,874 --> 00:06:23,690
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Exploration.

117
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,300
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Quite good. You've done a good job.

118
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:28,585
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}I'm really appreciated your participation.

119
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:33,097
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}By far, we have discussed the meaning and significance of creativity.

120
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,409
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}And we have found many effective ways to be creative.

121
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:40,537
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Next let's show our creativity by playing a game.

122
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,849
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Are you interested?

123
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,561
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Yes. Let's do it.

124
00:06:45,257 --> 00:06:47,689
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}In the following table, there are many words.

125
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,945
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}So try to find some words

126
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,577
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}and set their relationship with "creativity" or "creative", respectively.

127
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,314
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Look. First, let's try to find these words.

128
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,800
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}You see, so many letters.

129
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:05,609
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}And what words can you find?

130
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,817
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Block.

131
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,689
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Computer. Good.

132
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:12,121
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Imagination. Yes.

133
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,913
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Rest. Good.

134
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,145
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Singing. Yes. Here it is.

135
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,500
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Writing. Yes.

136
00:07:23,115 --> 00:07:25,500
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Drawing. Yes. The last word drawing.

137
00:07:25,501 --> 00:07:29,415
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Ok. And then, let's try to set the relationship

138
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,840
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}between these words and creativity or creative.

139
00:07:32,896 --> 00:07:34,824
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Anyone would like to say something?

140
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,192
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}For example, "block".

141
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:45,752
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}So anybody would like to say something about "block" and "creativity"?

142
00:07:45,815 --> 00:07:48,137
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Anyone?

143
00:07:50,448 --> 00:07:51,815
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Would you please.

144
00:07:51,816 --> 00:07:58,415
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Playing block is helpful to developing the creativity.

145
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,715
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Yes, exactly, good.

146
00:08:00,215 --> 00:08:04,905
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Playing blocks is very helpful to develop creativity.

147
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:10,915
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}So that's why blocks are very popular in western countries.

148
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,889
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}You know? Yeah.

149
00:08:13,215 --> 00:08:18,297
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Computer. Anyone would like to say something?

150
00:08:18,304 --> 00:08:20,313
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei}Yeah, would you please.

151
