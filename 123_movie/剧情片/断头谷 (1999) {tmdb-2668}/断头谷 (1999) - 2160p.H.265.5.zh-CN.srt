1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:08,417
This tree is a gateway
between two worlds.

2
00:00:20,404 --> 00:00:25,933
This ground has been disturbed.
The soil is loose. Bring the shovel.

3
00:00:44,228 --> 00:00:48,790
The skull is gone.
Taken.

4
00:00:48,932 --> 00:00:51,901
That's why he returns from the grave.

5
00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:55,732
To take heads
until his own is restored to him.

6
00:01:13,924 --> 00:01:16,119
lchabod?

7
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:07,707
Split up. Glenn. Theodore.

8
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:32,197
- Don't pick your teeth, it's a bad habit.
- l am a bad habit.

9
00:02:32,336 --> 00:02:36,067
- There's nothing for it.
- Oh, isn't there?

10
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:57,625
- Let's get ready for bed.
- Yes.

11
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,483
Beth, run!

12
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,673
Be quiet.

1
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,758
- Wait, he's not after you.
- I'II get him.

2
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,381
We cannot win this.

3
00:07:52,483 --> 00:07:55,850
RemarkabIe. A wound Iike this
shouId have kiIIed him, -

4
00:07:55,986 --> 00:08:00,753
- but it needs no stitch,
and there's hardIy a Ioss of bIood.

5
00:08:00,891 --> 00:08:07,353
- You must be stiII. The fever is on you.
- Katrina ...

6
00:08:07,498 --> 00:08:14,597
Nostradamus, Mediamus,
miIk of mercy, in media nos Iaudamas.

7
00:08:31,388 --> 00:08:34,880
Katrina, I tried to stop Brom ...

8
00:08:36,226 --> 00:08:39,821
Drink this down,
it wiII make you sIeep.

9
00:08:39,964 --> 00:08:44,196
The Horseman was not set to kiII Brom
or me. Had Brom not attacked him ...

10
00:08:44,335 --> 00:08:46,428
Later. Rest now.

11
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:50,006
The Horseman doesn't kiII at random.

12
00:08:50,474 --> 00:08:55,935
His victims are chosen by
that very person who took his skuII.

13
00:08:57,147 --> 00:09:02,050
Someone who knew where to dig,
of fIesh and bIood, as I've aIways said.

14
00:09:02,186 --> 00:09:05,383
- These are ravings.
- Drink.

15
00:09:54,672 --> 00:09:57,106
Ichabod ...

16
00:10:17,528 --> 00:10:22,522
- You were dreaming.
- Yes. Of things I had forgotten ...

17
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:28,331
... and wouId not Iike to remember.

18
00:10:28,472 --> 00:10:33,171
- TeII me what you dreamt.
- My mother was an innocent.

19
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:36,643
A chiId of nature.

20
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:42,343
Condemned.
Murdered ... by my father.

21
00:10:42,953 --> 00:10:46,980
- Murdered by ..?
- Murdered to save her souI.

22
00:10:47,124 --> 00:10:52,460
By a BibIe-bIack tyrant,
behind a mask of righteousness.

23
00:10:52,596 --> 00:10:55,690
I was seven when I Iost my faith.

24
00:10:58,268 --> 00:11:01,829
- What do you beIieve in?
- Sense and reason.

25
00:11:02,372 --> 00:11:04,533
Cause and consequence.

26
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:12,246
But here my rationaI mind has been
so controverted by the spirit worId.

27
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:19,114
You'II take nothing from SIeepy HoIIow
that was worth the coming here?

28
00:11:19,256 --> 00:11:21,884
No, not nothing.

29
00:11:24,495 --> 00:11:29,990
A kiss from a IoveIy young woman,
before she saw me or knew my name.

30
00:11:30,634 --> 00:11:33,933
Yes, without sense or reason.

31
00:11:37,775 --> 00:11:44,010
Forgive me. I speak of kisses,
and you've Iost your brave man Brom.

32
00:11:46,049 --> 00:11:48,984
I have shed my tears for Brom, -

33
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:54,352
- and yet my heart is not broken.
Do you think me wicked?

34
00:11:55,492 --> 00:12:01,055
No. But perhaps
there is a bit of witch in you.

35
00:12:02,232 --> 00:12:06,134
- Why do you say that?
- Because you've bewitched me.

36
00:12:21,451 --> 00:12:23,442
You sIept Iike the dead.

37
00:12:23,587 --> 00:12:27,956
You're too kind to me. I don't Iook
to be served by the Iady of the house.

38
00:12:28,091 --> 00:12:32,289
Nor wouId you be,
but that the servant girI has vanished.

39
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:36,126
- Sarah?
- Run away, Iike so many others.

40
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,898
Theyre aII Ieaving in fear.

41
00:12:40,737 --> 00:12:42,830
Where is Katrina?

42
00:12:42,973 --> 00:12:46,966
She watched over you tiII dawn.
Now it is her turn to sIeep.

43
00:12:54,184 --> 00:12:57,017
I'm fit for another day, I think.

44
00:12:58,322 --> 00:12:59,880
Fit enough to face a mortaI adversary.

45
00:13:03,293 --> 00:13:07,195
Dr. Lancaster.
Reverend Steenwyck.

46
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:15,003
Notary Hardenbrook
and Magistrate PhiIipse ...

47
00:13:16,473 --> 00:13:19,931
... who tried to cut and run,
and Iost his head.

48
00:13:20,077 --> 00:13:25,845
Four frightened men arguing together
on the very night PhiIipse was kiIIed.

49
00:13:27,517 --> 00:13:30,042
There is conspiracy here.

50
00:13:34,124 --> 00:13:38,891
The doctor, the reverend,
the notary and the magistrate.

51
00:13:41,531 --> 00:13:45,194
What is the secret that unites them?

52
00:13:47,504 --> 00:13:51,907
Magistrate PhiIipse knew
there were five bodies to four graves.

53
00:13:52,042 --> 00:13:57,139
He knew the widow was pregnant and
wouId not teII me the father's name.

54
00:13:58,849 --> 00:14:02,580
What does this point to?

55
00:14:08,492 --> 00:14:11,791
We must proceed
by process of eIimination.

56
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:18,198
I'II Iist everyone in town, starting with
its chief citizen, BaItus Van TasseI.

57
00:14:21,338 --> 00:14:24,671
- I feeI we're getting very cIose.
- Yes ...

58
00:14:24,808 --> 00:14:30,906
I suppose BaItus is the chief citizen,
now that oId Van Garrett is dead.

59
00:14:31,048 --> 00:14:35,382
The Van Garretts ...
I'd aImost forgotten them.

60
00:14:46,229 --> 00:14:49,824
Come with me,
to Notary Hardenbrook's.

61
00:14:49,967 --> 00:14:55,872
- Have you thought of something?
- Yes ... I have.

62
00:15:10,454 --> 00:15:11,716
HopeIess.

63
00:15:20,664 --> 00:15:24,794
My father's satcheI.
Why is it here?

64
00:15:29,506 --> 00:15:33,374
- Leave me aIone.
- Notary Hardenbrook ...

65
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:37,310
Show me the Iast wiII and testament
of oId man Van Garrett.

66
00:15:37,781 --> 00:15:42,081
- The wiII Ieaves everything to his son.
- Who died with him.

67
00:15:42,219 --> 00:15:47,680
- The estate passes to the next of kin.
- NaturaIIy. AII IegaI and above board.

68
00:15:48,358 --> 00:15:54,160
- Sir?.
- I'm a dead man. No ...

69
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:58,529
Van Garrett's seaI, broken.

70
00:16:01,238 --> 00:16:08,701
He made a new wiII just before he died,
naming ... Widow Winship?

71
00:16:08,845 --> 00:16:13,873
And here, Iook.
A marriage certificate.

72
00:16:14,584 --> 00:16:20,682
He secretIy married the widow and Ieft
everything to her and her unborn chiId.

73
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:26,888
It stood between Van Garrett's fortune
and the one who'd have got everything.

74
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:32,229
It's true, but we four
were drawn in against our wiII.

75
00:16:32,803 --> 00:16:34,862
- Your wiII?
- He means ...

76
00:16:35,505 --> 00:16:39,839
Of course, the four town eIders.

77
00:16:39,976 --> 00:16:45,073
Now I see what parts you had to pIay.
Steenwyck knew the secret.

78
00:16:45,215 --> 00:16:50,209
He performed the marriage. Lancaster
attended the pregnant woman.

79
00:16:50,353 --> 00:16:56,485
PhiIipse gave protection of the Iaw.
Hardenbrook conceaIed documents -

80
00:16:56,626 --> 00:16:59,925
- entrusted by Van Garrett
to his faithfuI servant.

81
00:17:00,063 --> 00:17:06,229
- The conspirators drawn into the pIot.
- We knew not it was a murdering pIot.

82
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:08,530
But I have not finished, sir.

83
00:17:08,672 --> 00:17:14,042
First, the Van Garretts sIain by
a horseman raised from the grave.

84
00:17:14,177 --> 00:17:18,238
Up pops a widow with a cIaim
on the fortune. Off with her head.

85
00:17:18,715 --> 00:17:23,015
But murder begets murder.
It was the servant ...

86
00:17:23,153 --> 00:17:27,817
... Jonathan Masbath. The night father
and son quarreIIed over the new wiII.

87
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:32,493
Masbath was summoned upstairs
to bear witness.

88
00:17:32,629 --> 00:17:37,089
Here is his signature.
I'm afraid it was his death warrant.

89
00:17:37,234 --> 00:17:41,534
The Horseman came for him.
Came for him -

90
00:17:41,671 --> 00:17:46,768
- at the bidding of someone who had
power over him, who dug in the earth -

91
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:52,974
- and stoIe the skuII, which must again
be his before he wiII return to heII.

92
00:17:53,116 --> 00:17:57,246
Someone who stood to gain
or Iose a fortune. None other -

93
00:17:57,387 --> 00:18:01,756
- than Van Garrett's next of kin,
BaItus Van TasseI미

94
00:18:07,731 --> 00:18:11,827
- Katrina, why are you in my room?
- Because it is yours.

95
00:18:16,072 --> 00:18:20,873
- Was it wicked of me?
- No, not at aII.

96
00:18:22,112 --> 00:18:27,311
- I missed you. Where did you go?
- I had questions to ask Hardenbrook.

97
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:33,411
- Did you Iearn anything of interest?
- Perhaps.

98
00:18:34,457 --> 00:18:36,448
- My father ...
- Your father?.

99
00:18:36,593 --> 00:18:40,359
Yes. My father thinks
you shouId return to New York.

100
00:18:40,497 --> 00:18:43,796
ReaIIy?. Why is that?

101
00:18:44,568 --> 00:18:49,130
I don't know. Perhaps he Iooked in your
Iedger and did not Iike what he saw.

102
00:18:55,512 --> 00:18:59,676
- What have you there?
- Evidence. I'm sorry, I must ask you ...

103
00:18:59,816 --> 00:19:03,513
Then I'II Ieave you to your thoughts.

104
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:18,863
- It's just a spider.
- KiII it미

105
00:19:19,002 --> 00:19:24,463
- No, stop it미
- There's something under here.

106
00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:28,704
- What is it?
- HeIp me move the bed.

107
00:19:28,845 --> 00:19:31,678
No, I mustn't. You do it.

108
00:19:37,721 --> 00:19:44,058
The eviI eye. It is someone
casting speIIs against you.

109
00:19:44,194 --> 00:19:47,652
The eviI eye ...

110
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,710
Wait here.

111
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:56,354
Katrina ...

112
00:21:57,861 --> 00:22:01,627
- You took the evidence and burned it.
- So it wouId not accuse my father.

113
00:22:01,765 --> 00:22:07,362
I accuse no one. But if there is guiIt,
I cannot aIter it, even if it grieves me.

114
00:22:07,504 --> 00:22:14,000
No speIIs of yours can aIter it, either.
It is he who profits from these murders.

115
00:22:14,144 --> 00:22:17,910
If you knew him, you'd not have
such harsh thoughts about him.

116
00:22:18,047 --> 00:22:24,145
- Nor if you feIt anything for me.
- Why did his friends conceaI ..?

117
00:22:24,287 --> 00:22:28,485
You are the constabIe. Find another
chain of reasoning and Iet me be.

118
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:33,426
I cannot. Nor the one or the other.
And I am heartsick with it.

119
00:22:33,563 --> 00:22:38,262
I think you have no heart,
and I had a mind once to give you mine.

120
00:22:39,702 --> 00:22:42,899
Yes, I think you Ioved me -

121
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,497
- when you foIIowed me into the woods.
To have braved such periI.

122
00:22:46,643 --> 00:22:52,445
What periI was there if it was my own
father who controIIed the Horseman?

123
00:22:56,219 --> 00:23:00,178
Goodbye, Ichabod Crane. I curse
the day you came to SIeepy HoIIow.

124
00:23:05,462 --> 00:23:10,331
- She wiII not see you.
- Did she say anything?

125
00:23:12,302 --> 00:23:15,669
OnIy that she wiII not come down.

126
00:23:15,805 --> 00:23:19,935
- I see. Thank you.
- ConstabIe ...

127
00:23:21,411 --> 00:23:25,939
You have not asked me
how I hurt my hand since yesterday, -

128
00:23:26,082 --> 00:23:29,518
- which wouId have been poIite.

129
00:23:29,652 --> 00:23:36,057
In fact, you have been as carefuI
not to Iook at it as not to mention it.

130
00:23:37,594 --> 00:23:42,759
- Yes, I'm sorry. How did you ..?
- I know you saw me.

131
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:47,563
- What?
- I know you foIIowed Iast night.

132
00:23:47,704 --> 00:23:52,835
You must promise not to teII my
husband what you saw. Promise me미

133
00:23:53,943 --> 00:23:58,505
The town is in ferment미 Horror
piIed on tragedy. Hardenbrook is dead미

134
00:23:58,648 --> 00:24:02,778
- That harmIess oId man?
- Hanged himseIf in the night.

135
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:06,047
- Hanged himseIf?
- There's a church meeting tonight.

136
00:24:06,189 --> 00:24:11,149
Everyone is going to speak out
against you. If you are wise, -

137
00:24:11,294 --> 00:24:15,822
- you wiII Ieave this pIace.
What is that?

138
00:24:16,399 --> 00:24:20,426
- I was careIess with the kitchen knife.
- The wound Iooks angry.

139
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:25,098
I wiII bind it with arrowroot fIowers.
I know where some grow.

140
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:40,014
Hurry up,
the meeting beII has started toIIing.

141
00:25:03,746 --> 00:25:10,345
The Horseman미
Katrina, the Horseman saved me미

142
00:25:12,455 --> 00:25:16,016
The Horseman kiIIed your stepmother미

143
00:25:24,834 --> 00:25:26,392
Oh, God미

144
00:25:56,566 --> 00:26:01,196
You'II kiII us aII미
You're the one the Horseman wants미

145
00:26:20,923 --> 00:26:22,914
He cannot enter.

146
00:26:32,702 --> 00:26:37,435
The Horseman cannot enter미
He cannot cross the gate.

147
00:26:37,573 --> 00:26:41,100
We have to save ourseIves.

148
00:26:41,244 --> 00:26:44,236
The next person to Iay a hand on me
wiII get a buIIet미

149
00:26:46,115 --> 00:26:48,583
He's coming back미

150
00:26:55,224 --> 00:26:59,684
- Enough have died. It's time to confess.
- What is it that you know?.

151
00:26:59,829 --> 00:27:04,823
Your four friends pIayed you faIse.
We were possessed by one who ...

152
00:27:14,544 --> 00:27:16,478
Stay back미

153
00:27:34,697 --> 00:27:37,825
There's a conspiracy here,
and I wiII seek it out미

154
00:28:54,377 --> 00:28:57,540
It was an eviI spirit possessed you.

155
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:03,141
I pray it is satisfied and that you find
peace. The eviI eye has done its work.

156
00:29:03,286 --> 00:29:07,746
My Iife is over. Spared for
a Iifetime of horrors in my sIeep.

157
00:29:08,891 --> 00:29:11,883
Waking each day to grief.

158
00:29:17,266 --> 00:29:20,235
Goodbye, Katrina.

159
00:29:57,173 --> 00:30:01,303
- You think it was Katrina, don't you?
- That can never be uttered.

160
00:30:01,444 --> 00:30:04,743
A strange sort of witch,
with a kind and Ioving heart.

161
00:30:04,881 --> 00:30:07,247
- How can you think so?
- I have good reason.

162
00:30:07,383 --> 00:30:11,319
- Then you are bewitched by reason.
- And beaten down by it미

163
00:30:16,158 --> 00:30:20,060
It is a hard Iesson for a hard worId.
You'd better Iearn it.

164
00:30:20,196 --> 00:30:26,157
ViIIainy wears many masks. None
so dangerous as the mask of virtue.

165
00:30:33,376 --> 00:30:35,469
FareweII.

166
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:08,068
Return the coach미 Turn around now미

167
00:32:21,384 --> 00:32:23,875
Pardon my intrusion.

168
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:38,594
No bIood fIow,
no cIotting, no heaIing.

169
00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:44,262
When this cut was made,
this woman was aIready dead.

170
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:57,275
Dear stepdaughter.

171
00:32:58,721 --> 00:33:01,952
You Iook as if you'd seen a ghost.

172
00:33:32,555 --> 00:33:38,755
Rise up once more, my dark avenger.
One more night of beheading.

173
00:33:39,295 --> 00:33:41,422
Rise up with your sword.

174
00:33:41,797 --> 00:33:45,631
A head for a head.

175
00:33:45,768 --> 00:33:48,760
My unhoIy horseman, rise.

176
00:33:48,904 --> 00:33:53,500
Come now for Katrina.

177
00:34:06,922 --> 00:34:09,482
Awake at Iast.

178
00:34:09,859 --> 00:34:14,353
- You thought it was aII a nasty dream?
- Father saw the Horseman kiII you.

179
00:34:15,164 --> 00:34:18,827
He saw the Horseman come toward
me with his sword unsheathed, -

180
00:34:19,468 --> 00:34:25,634
- but it is I who govern the Horseman,
dear, and BaItus did not stay to watch.

181
00:34:30,346 --> 00:34:33,611
- But there was a body.
- The servant girI, Sarah.

182
00:34:33,749 --> 00:34:36,809
I aIways thought she was useIess ...

183
00:34:39,688 --> 00:34:42,452
... but she had a purpose after aII.

184
00:34:47,696 --> 00:34:53,225
- Who are you?
- My famiIy name was Archer.

185
00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:56,361
The archer?.

186
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:05,913
I Iived with my father, mother and sister
in a cottage not far from here.

187
00:35:06,048 --> 00:35:13,250
My father died, and the IandIord, whom
we'd served faithfuIIy, evicted us.

188
00:35:14,123 --> 00:35:20,153
No one wouId take us in, because my
mother was suspected of witchcraft.

189
00:35:20,296 --> 00:35:24,960
She schooIed her daughters weII, whiIe
we Iived as outcasts in the woods.

190
00:35:26,235 --> 00:35:28,703
She died within a year.

191
00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:39,206
My sister and I remained in our refuge,
seeing not a souI.

192
00:35:39,348 --> 00:35:45,878
UntiI one day, gathering firewood,
we crossed the path of the Hessian.

193
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:57,631
I saw his death. At that moment,
I offered my souI to Satan, -

194
00:35:57,766 --> 00:36:03,363
- if he wouId raise the Hessian
from the grave to avenge me.

195
00:36:06,742 --> 00:36:09,905
- Avenge you?
- Against Van Garrett미

196
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:13,344
The IandIord who showed us no mercy
and Ieft us to starve, -

197
00:36:13,482 --> 00:36:18,476
- whiIst BaItus and his simpering wife
and girI chiId stoIe our home.

198
00:36:18,621 --> 00:36:21,988
I'd make myseIf mistress of aII he had.

199
00:36:22,124 --> 00:36:26,720
The easiest was to enter your house
as your mother's sick-nurse, -

200
00:36:26,895 --> 00:36:31,059
- and put her body into the grave,
and my own into the marriage bed.

201
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:38,436
Not quite so easy was to secure
my Iegacy. The widow had to go, -

202
00:36:38,574 --> 00:36:44,535
- and the servant Masbath. Just the
other day, that siIIy midwife KiIIian -

203
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,877
- toId me the widow
had toId her a big secret.

204
00:36:48,017 --> 00:36:52,977
And she toId me this right in front
of her husband미 What a goose미

205
00:36:53,355 --> 00:36:57,951
So, another IittIe job for the Horseman.

206
00:36:59,461 --> 00:37:05,798
But Iust deIivered
the Rev. Steenwyck into my power.

207
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:10,997
Fear did the same for Hardenbrook
and the drunkard PhiIipse.

208
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,837
And the doctor's siIence I exchanged
for my compIicity -

209
00:37:14,977 --> 00:37:19,243
- in his fornications
with the servant girI Sarah.

210
00:37:19,381 --> 00:37:25,149
- Yes, you have everything now.
- No, you have, my dear.

211
00:37:25,287 --> 00:37:30,725
By your father's wiII. I get everything
in the event of your death.

212
00:37:32,194 --> 00:37:37,257
Oh, my sister, by the way,
sadIy passed away.

213
00:37:39,501 --> 00:37:42,129
Quite recentIy.

214
00:37:43,472 --> 00:37:48,205
- You kiIIed your own sister.
- She brought it on herseIf.

215
00:37:48,344 --> 00:37:51,211
By heIping you and your master미

216
00:37:52,281 --> 00:37:55,614
You're just in time
to have your head cut off.

217
00:37:55,751 --> 00:37:59,312
Tonight the Horseman comes for you미

218
00:38:05,994 --> 00:38:08,155
Katrina미

219
00:38:13,702 --> 00:38:15,431
Thank God.

220
00:38:24,012 --> 00:38:26,105
Watch your head.

221
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:44,121
To the roof. I have an idea.

222
00:39:43,759 --> 00:39:45,954
Jump in the saiIs미

223
00:40:00,776 --> 00:40:03,040
Jump미

224
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:09,414
Hurry미

225
00:40:28,904 --> 00:40:32,704
- Is he dead?
- He was dead to begin with.

226
00:40:56,698 --> 00:40:59,724
- Where are we going?
- Anywhere but here.

227
00:41:12,214 --> 00:41:14,512
Take the reins.

228
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,257
My bag미

229
00:42:50,412 --> 00:42:51,845
Jump미

230
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:57,538
- StiII aIive?
- Run, Katrina.

231
00:43:58,113 --> 00:44:02,049
Yes, do run and jump and skip.

232
00:44:13,995 --> 00:44:19,524
Here, take her미 She's yours미

233
00:44:23,038 --> 00:44:26,474
Sir, you're not dead미

234
00:45:07,315 --> 00:45:09,442
Horseman미

235
00:48:41,396 --> 00:48:44,160
Just in time for a new century.

236
00:48:56,444 --> 00:48:58,435
You'II soon get your bearings,
young Masbath.

237
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:03,984
The Bronx is up, the Battery's down,
and home is this way.
