1
00:01:11,318 --> 00:01:14,116
二次大战迫近
With the coming of the Second World War...

2
00:01:14,454 --> 00:01:18,692
很多被困在欧洲的人们 怀着希望甚至急切地
...many eyes in imprisoned Europe turned hopefully, or desperately...

3
00:01:18,792 --> 00:01:21,619
想要来到自由的美洲
...toward the freedom of the Americas.

4
00:01:21,695 --> 00:01:24,323
里斯本成为热络的航运地点
Lisbon became the great embarkation point.

5
00:01:24,531 --> 00:01:27,694
不过并非每个人均能直接 到达里斯本
But not everybody could get to Lisbon directly.

6
00:01:28,135 --> 00:01:31,798
因此一条艰苦迂回的 逃难路线出现
And so a torturous, roundabout refugee trail sprang up.

7
00:01:32,839 --> 00:01:34,466
从巴黎到马赛
Paris to Marseilles...

8
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,142
越过地中海到奥朗
...across the Mediterranean to Oran.

9
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,950
然后搭火车、汽车或走路 沿着非洲的海岸线
Then, by train or auto or foot, across the rim of Africa...

10
00:01:55,162 --> 00:01:57,630
来到法属摩洛哥的卡萨布兰卡
...to Casablanca in French Morocco.

11
00:01:57,931 --> 00:02:01,868
在这里幸运的人 藉着钱、影响力、或运气
Here, the fortunate ones, through money or influence or luck...

12
00:02:01,968 --> 00:02:06,463
可能拿到出境许可证 然后赶往里斯本
...might obtain exit visas and scurry to Lisbon.

13
00:02:06,473 --> 00:02:08,703
再从里斯本到新世界
And from Lisbon to the New World.

14
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:12,106
不过其余的人则在卡萨布兰卡
But the others wait in Casablanca.

15
00:02:12,779 --> 00:02:16,237
等待、等待、再等待
And wait and wait

16
00:02:27,894 --> 00:02:29,486
所有军官注意
To all officers:

17
00:02:29,663 --> 00:02:32,635
两位身怀重要官方文件的德国快递员
Two German couriers carrying official documents...

18
00:02:32,643 --> 00:02:34,635
在从奥朗开出的火车上被杀
...murdered on train from Oran.

19
00:02:34,735 --> 00:02:37,727
凶手和可能的共犯 正前往卡萨布兰卡
Murderer and possible accomplices headed for Casablanca.

20
00:02:37,938 --> 00:02:42,075
拘留所有嫌疑人物 并搜查被偷走的文件
Round up all suspicious characters and search them for stolen document.

21
00:02:42,175 --> 00:02:43,506
这个任务相当重要
Important.

22
00:02:50,384 --> 00:02:54,218
(法语)

23
00:03:15,275 --> 00:03:16,674
可否看一下你的证件?
May we see your papers?

24
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,671
我没有带在身上
I don't think I have them on me.

25
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,249
既然如此 我们必须请你跟我们走 等一下 可能是...
- In that case, you'll have to come along. - Wait. It 's possible that I...

26
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:24,442
在这里
Yes. Here they are.

27
00:03:27,587 --> 00:03:29,456
这些证件三个星期前已过期了  你必须跟我们走
These papers expired three weeks ago. You'll have to come along.

28
00:03:29,556 --> 00:03:32,351
站住!
Halt!

29
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:34,617
站住!
Halt!

30
00:03:49,976 --> 00:03:52,740
“自由，平等，同胞爱”

31
00:03:59,486 --> 00:04:02,250
那边发生什么事?  我不知道  亲爱的
- What on earth is going on there? - I don't know, my dear.

32
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:04,923
对不起  先生  你没听说吗?
Pardon, monsieur. Pardon, madame. Have you not heard?

33
00:04:05,091 --> 00:04:07,889
我们听到的不多 我们听得明白的更少
We hear very little, and we understand even less.

34
00:04:08,094 --> 00:04:11,723
两位德国快递员在沙漠被发现遭谋杀  那无人的沙漠
Two German couriers were found murdered in the desert. The unoccupied desert.

35
00:04:11,932 --> 00:04:14,400
这是惯例的搜捕自由主义者
This is the customary roundup of refugees, liberals...

36
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:18,230
难民和给警察首长的漂亮女孩
...and, of course, a beautiful young girl for Renault, the prefect of police.

37
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:24,980
不幸的是伴随着这些不快乐的难民
Along with these unappy refugees,

38
00:04:24,989 --> 00:04:26,980
是欧洲的坏蛋们 都集中到卡萨布兰卡
the scum of Europe has gravitated to Casablanca.

39
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,446
有些为了出境证等了好几年
Some of them have been waiting years for a visa.

40
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:32,914
我请求你  先生  自己要当心 谨慎提防
I beg of you, monsieur, watch yourself. Be on guard.

41
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:35,110
这地方布满贪婪的人
This place is full of vultures.

42
00:04:35,288 --> 00:04:38,018
到处都是贪婪的人  到处都是
Vultures everywhere. Everywhere!

43
00:04:38,191 --> 00:04:41,359
谢谢  非常感谢 不谢 再见
- Thank you. Thank you very much. - Not at all.

44
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:44,694
很有趣的小家伙
What an amusing little fellow.

45
00:04:44,898 --> 00:04:46,195
服务生
Waiter.

46
00:04:47,734 --> 00:04:49,734
我真笨 什么?  亲爱的
- Oh, how silly of me. - What, dear?

47
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:52,135
我把皮夹子留在饭店
I've left my wallet in the hotel.

48
00:05:07,988 --> 00:05:09,956
或许明天我们会在飞机上
Perhaps tomorrow we'll be on the plane.

49
00:05:10,457 --> 00:05:13,858
“瑞克美式咖啡馆”

50
00:05:35,515 --> 00:05:37,250
希特勒万岁!

51
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,375
再见到你真好  史查沙少校
It is good to see you again, Major Strasser.

00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:44,072
让我来介绍雷诺队长 卡萨布兰卡的警察首长
May I present Captain Renault, police prefect of Casablanca.

54
00:05:44,087 --> 00:05:45,292
史查沙少校
Major Strasser.

55
00:05:45,392 --> 00:05:47,417
未被占据的法国属地 欢迎你来到卡萨布兰卡

56
00:05:47,761 --> 00:05:49,592
谢谢  队长  来到这里真好
Thank you, captain. It's good to be here.

57
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:52,424
史查沙少校  这位是我的副官 卡箫副队长
Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant Casselle.

58
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:55,067
唐里尼队长 意大利军听候指示
Captain Tonnelli. The Italian service at your command.

59
00:05:55,235 --> 00:05:55,869
下次吧  谢谢
That is kind of you.

60
00:05:55,969 --> 00:05:58,096
(意大利文)

61
00:05:58,204 --> 00:06:02,809
他听不明白你说什么 (法语)

62
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:05,742
你可能觉得 卡萨布兰卡的天气有一点暖
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm.

63
00:06:05,912 --> 00:06:09,575
全德国人必须适应各种天气 从俄国到撒哈拉
We Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara.

64
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,919
或许你所指的不是天气 不然会是什么?  亲爱的少校
- Perhaps you werert referring to weather. - What else?

65
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:15,283
关于被谋杀的快递员 你们做了些什么?
The murder of the couriers. What has been done?

66
00:06:15,455 --> 00:06:19,255
我的手下逮捕的疑犯人数是平常的两倍
My men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.

67
00:06:19,426 --> 00:06:22,452
我们已知道凶手是谁 很好  我已在警方监管中吗?
- But we know already who the murderer is. - Good. Is he in custody?

68
00:06:22,662 --> 00:06:24,161
不必急 今晚他会去瑞克咖啡馆
No hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's.

69
00:06:24,162 --> 00:06:25,661
每个人都会去瑞克咖啡馆
Everybody comes to Rick's.

70
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:29,223
我已听说过这家咖啡馆 并且听说过瑞克他本人
I've already heard about this cafe. And also about Mr. Rick himself.

71
00:07:24,924 --> 00:07:27,017
等待、等待、等待
Waiting, waiting, waiting.

72
00:07:27,227 --> 00:07:29,195
我永远离不开这里了
I'll never get out of here.

73
00:07:29,562 --> 00:07:31,462
我会死在卡萨布兰卡
I'll die in Casablanca.

74
00:07:31,665 --> 00:07:33,895
可是你不能再加一点吗?
But can't you make it just a little more?

75
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:35,034
求求你
Please?

76
00:07:35,268 --> 00:07:37,404
对不起  女士 可是钻石在市场上不易脱手
Sorry, but diamonds are a drug on the market. Everybody sells diamonds.

77
00:07:37,504 --> 00:07:41,207
所有的人都在卖钻石 到处都是钻石  两千四百元
There are diamonds everywhere. 2400.

78
00:07:41,307 --> 00:07:42,433
好吧
All right.

79
00:07:42,642 --> 00:07:45,312
卡车准备好了  人手在等着 一切都...
The trucks are waiting. The men are waiting. Everything...

80
00:07:45,412 --> 00:07:49,371
(德语)

81
00:07:49,482 --> 00:07:51,507
是"圣地牙哥号" 渔船
It's the fishing smack Santiago.

82
00:07:51,685 --> 00:07:56,088
明天晚上一点离开 这里  从麦地那号后第三艘船
It leaves at 1 tomorrow night, here from the end of La Medina. Third boat.

83
00:07:56,289 --> 00:07:59,591
谢谢  谢谢 并带一万五千元法O现金
- Thank you. Thank you. - And bring 15,000 francs in cash.

84
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,023
记住  一定要现金
Remember, in cash.

85
00:08:02,095 --> 00:08:05,531
不必愁，我们全都预备好了

86
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:08,668
(俄语)

87
00:08:10,804 --> 00:08:13,602
开门  阿都 是的  教授先生
- Open up, Abdul. - Yes, professor.

88
00:08:14,574 --> 00:08:17,042
先生 女士红色

89
00:08:17,143 --> 00:08:18,508
先生黑色

90
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,345
服务生 是的  女士
- Waiter? - Yes, madame?

91
00:08:24,551 --> 00:08:27,213
可否问瑞克要不要跟我们喝酒
Will you ask Rick if he'll have a drink with us?

92
00:08:27,554 --> 00:08:31,116
女士  他从不跟顾客喝酒的 从来不  我从没见过
Madame, he never drinks with customers. Never. I have never seen it.

93
00:08:31,224 --> 00:08:34,057
是什么原因?  使酒廊老板如此势利
What makes saloonkeepers so snobbish?

94
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:38,091
或许如果你告诉他 我在阿姆斯特丹 经营第二大银行
Perhaps if you told him I ran the second-largest banking house in Amsterdam.

95
00:08:38,164 --> 00:08:40,792
第二大?  那不会叫瑞克刮目相看
Second largest? That wouldn't impress Rick.

96
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:44,528
阿姆斯特丹的头号银行家 现在是我们厨房的糕饼师傅
The leading banker in Amsterdam is now the pastry chef in our kitchen.

97
00:08:44,738 --> 00:08:47,206
我们有值得盼望的事情了
We have something to look forward to.

98
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,736
而他爸爸是侍者
And his father is the bellboy.

99
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:54,476
给女士的 先生

100
00:08:56,616 --> 00:08:58,709
“一千法O”

101
00:08:58,818 --> 00:09:01,184
“好的，瑞克”

102
00:09:20,507 --> 00:09:21,940
对不起
Excuse me.

103
00:09:24,377 --> 00:09:26,878
对不起  先生 这是私人的房间
I'm sorry, sir. This is a private room.

104
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,883
好大胆  我知道里面在赌博  又不是秘密
Of all the nerve. Who do you think...? I know there is gambling in there.

105
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,385
你岂敢不让我进去  有什么麻烦?  这位先生
- You dare not keep me out. - Yes? What's the trouble?

106
00:09:33,887 --> 00:09:36,879
从夏威夷到柏林每个赌场 我都去过
I have been in every gambling room between Honolulu and Berlin.

107
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,652
如果你认为 不该让我进这种赌场
And if you think I'm going to be kept out of a saloon like this,

108
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,252
你可是大错特错
you're much mistaken.

109
00:09:41,327 --> 00:09:43,261
对不起 哈罗  瑞克
Excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.

110
00:09:45,932 --> 00:09:47,729
你的现金在酒吧可以用
Your cash is good at the bar.

111
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:49,898
什么?  你知道我是谁吗?
What? Do you know who I am?

112
00:09:50,103 --> 00:09:52,071
我知道 酒吧让你光顾算你走运
I do. You're lucky the bar is open to you.

113
00:09:52,272 --> 00:09:55,241
可恶极了 我会向有关当局报告
This is outrageous! I shall report it to The Angriff.

114
00:09:58,077 --> 00:10:00,076
看你刚才那样对待德国银行家
You know, watching you just now,

115
00:10:00,077 --> 00:10:02,706
会以为你整辈子都在做这种事
one would think you've been doing this all your life.

116
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:05,582
是什么使你认为我没有?  没什么
- What makes you think I haven't? - Nothing.

117
00:10:05,785 --> 00:10:09,721
不过你刚来卡萨布兰卡时我想 你想什么?
- But when you first came, I thought... - You thought what?

118
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,420
我有什么权利去想?
What right do I have to think?

119
00:10:17,497 --> 00:10:18,725
我可以吗?
May I

120
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:22,426
那两名德国快递员真不幸 对不对
Too bad about those two German couriers, wasrt it?

121
00:10:22,602 --> 00:10:25,264
他们走运了 昨天他们还是两名德国办事员
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just clerks...

122
00:10:25,438 --> 00:10:27,702
而今天他们成了光荣的死者
...today they are the honored dead.

123
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:30,110
你是个很愤世嫉俗的人  瑞克  请原谅我这样说
You are a very cynical person, Rick, if you'll forgive me for saying so.

124
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,070
我原谅你
I forgive you.

125
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,940
谢谢  你可否跟我喝一杯 不
- Will you have a drink with me? - No.

126
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:38,952
我忘了  你从不跟任何人喝酒 请再给我一杯
I forgot, you never drink with... I'll have another, please.

127
00:10:39,052 --> 00:10:40,781
你轻视我  对不对?
You despise me, don't you?

128
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,145
如果是我让你这样想 我大概是吧
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.

129
00:10:43,356 --> 00:10:44,653
可是为什么?
But why?

130
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:47,755
你反对我所做的那种生意?
Do you object to the kind of business I do?

131
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:51,032
可是为那些可怜的难民想一想
But think of all those poor refugees...

132
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,032
如果我不帮他们必然困死这里
...who must rot in this place if I didn't help them.

133
00:10:53,132 --> 00:10:57,804
那不算太坏  透过我的方法 我提供他们出境许可证
That's not so bad. Through ways of my own, I provide them with exit visas.

134
00:10:57,904 --> 00:11:00,134
有代价的  尤佳迪  有代价的
For a price, Ugarte. For a price.

135
00:11:01,674 --> 00:11:04,700
为那些付不起 雷诺开的价钱的可怜虫想想
But think of all the poor devils who can't meet Renault 's price.

136
00:11:04,911 --> 00:11:08,406
我以半价替他们弄到手 这算寄生虫吗?
I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?

137
00:11:08,481 --> 00:11:12,076
我不反对寄生虫 我反对折价的寄生虫
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.

138
00:11:12,785 --> 00:11:15,652
在今晚之后 所有的事情将成过去
Well, after tonight I will be through with the whole business.

139
00:11:15,822 --> 00:11:18,518
我要离开卡萨布兰卡
And I' m leaving, finally, this Casablanca.

140
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:21,854
你的出境许可是向谁买的?  雷诺还是你自己?
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?

141
00:11:22,095 --> 00:11:25,428
我自己觉得自己的价钱较合理
Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.

142
00:11:25,932 --> 00:11:26,956
你看
Look, Rick.

143
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:29,301
知道这是什么吗?
Know what this is?

144
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:32,602
即使是你也从来没看过的东西
Something that even you have never seen.

145
00:11:32,805 --> 00:11:35,933
过境信函 由戴高乐将军签名的
Letters of transit signed by General de Gaulle.

146
00:11:36,175 --> 00:11:39,440
不能废止  甚至不能盘问
Cannot be rescinded. Not even questioned.

147
00:11:39,612 --> 00:11:40,579
等一下
One moment.

148
00:11:40,813 --> 00:11:44,078
今晚我会 以作梦也想不到的价钱卖出去
Tonight I' II be selling those for more money than I ever dreamed of.

149
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,083
然后  再见  卡萨布兰卡
And then, addio, Casablanca.

150
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:51,090
我在卡萨布兰卡有很多朋友 可是不晓得为什么
I have many a friend in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me...

151
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,522
因为你轻视我 你是我唯一信任的人
...you are the only one I trust.

152
00:11:53,526 --> 00:11:55,289
请你替我保管好吗?  多久?
Will you keep these for me, please?

153
00:11:55,495 --> 00:11:58,331
或许一小时  或许久一点点
- For how long? - Perhaps an hour. Perhaps a little longer.

154
00:11:58,431 --> 00:11:59,866
我不要放过夜
- I don't want them here overnight. - Don't be afraid of that.

155
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:02,959
别担心  请替我保管
Please keep them for me.

156
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:05,330
谢谢  我知道我可以信任你
Thank you. I knew I could trust you.

157
00:12:05,872 --> 00:12:07,840
侍者  我正在等一些人
Waiter. I' II be expecting some people.

158
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:10,677
如果有谁找我  我会在这里
If anybody asks for me, I'll be right here.

159
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:13,112
瑞克
Rick...

160
00:12:13,346 --> 00:12:15,439
我想你现在对我比较刮目相看
...I hope you're more impressed with me now.

161
00:12:16,783 --> 00:12:20,048
请恕我失陪  我要跟你的轮盘 分享我的好运气
If you'll forgive me, I' II share my good luck with your roulette wheel.

162
00:12:20,219 --> 00:12:21,311
等一下
Just a moment.

163
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:28,188
我听谣言说那两名德国快递员 身上带着过境信函
I heard a rumor those two German couriers were carrying letters of transit.

164
00:12:30,496 --> 00:12:32,899
我也听过那谣言  可怜虫
I've heard that rumor too. Poor devils.

165
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:39,099
你说对了  尤佳迪 我是对你比较刮目相看了
You're right, Ugarte. I am a little more impressed with you.

166
00:13:59,385 --> 00:14:00,353
哈罗  瑞克
- Hello, Rick. - Hello, Ferrari.

167
00:14:00,453 --> 00:14:02,614
法拉利 "蓝鹦鹉" 的生意如何
How's business at the Blue Parrot?

168
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:04,357
很好  不过我想买你的咖啡馆
- Fine, but I' d like to buy your cafe. - It 's not for sale.

169
00:14:04,457 --> 00:14:08,827
那是不卖的 你还没听我出价呢!  多少钱也不卖
- You haven't heard my offer. - It 's not for sale at any price.

170
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:12,527
你要多少才肯卖山姆 我不买卖人口
- What do you want for Sam? - I don't buy or sell human beings.

171
00:14:12,665 --> 00:14:14,792
可惜 人是卡萨布兰卡主要商品
Too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity.

172
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:17,132
光只是难民 我们就能大赚一笔
In refugees alone we could make a fortune,

173
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:19,132
如果你跟我一起做黑市生意
if you'd work with me in the black market.

174
00:14:19,238 --> 00:14:21,638
不妨你做你的  我做我的
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.

175
00:14:22,442 --> 00:14:24,910
我们不妨去问山姆 他喜欢改变一下
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.

176
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:26,170
我们不妨去问
Suppose we do.

177
00:14:26,345 --> 00:14:28,484
我亲爱的瑞克 什么时候才明白
When will you realize...

178
00:14:28,485 --> 00:14:31,484
在今天这个世界  孤立不再是项实际的政策
...that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy?

179
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:34,246
法拉利想要你到蓝鹦鹉工作
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.

180
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,512
我喜欢这里
Oh, I like it fine here.

181
00:14:35,721 --> 00:14:37,150
他出双倍我给你的薪水
- He'll double what I pay you.

182
00:14:37,221 --> 00:14:40,150
可是我在这里赚的钱已没时间花
- I ain't got time to spend what I make here.

183
00:14:40,426 --> 00:14:42,053
对不起
Sorry.

184
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:47,228
老板的私人存货
The boss's private stock...

185
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,834
因为  伊娃  我爱你 闭嘴
...because, Yvonne, I love you. - Oh, shut up.

186
00:14:50,036 --> 00:14:54,166
好吧  为了你  我会闭嘴 因为  伊娃  我爱你
All right, all right. For you, I shut up, because, Yvonne, I love you.

187
00:14:58,711 --> 00:15:01,373
一些德国人付了这张支票 可不可以?
Some Germans gave this check. Is it all right?

188
00:15:06,619 --> 00:15:07,881
你昨晚到那里了?
Where were you last night?

189
00:15:08,054 --> 00:15:10,318
那么久以前的事 我记不起来了
That's so long ago, I don't remember.

190
00:15:10,656 --> 00:15:13,989
我今晚可以见到你吗?  我从不计划那么遥远的事
- Will I see you tonight? - I never make plans that far ahead.

191
00:15:15,294 --> 00:15:16,522
再给我一杯
Give me another.

192
00:15:16,696 --> 00:15:19,460
沙克  她已喝够了 别听他的  帮我倒满
- Sascha, she's had enough. - Don't listen to him. Fill it up.

193
00:15:19,632 --> 00:15:21,827
伊娃我爱你  可是他付我薪水
Yvonne, I love you, but he pays me.

194
00:15:22,034 --> 00:15:24,604
瑞克  我已厌倦你了 沙克  叫部计程车 是的
- Rick, I' m tired of having you... - Sascha, call a cab.

195
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:26,005
来吧  我们去拿你的外衣
- We're gonna get your coat. - Take your hands off me.

196
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:29,833
别碰我 你该回家  你喝的已够多了
You're going home. You've had a little too much to drink.

197
00:15:32,311 --> 00:15:34,279
嘿  计程车
Hey, taxi.

198
00:15:35,014 --> 00:15:37,141
你以为你是谁?  把我推来推去
Who do you think you are, pushing me around?

199
00:15:37,316 --> 00:15:39,079
我真是傻瓜爱上你这种男人
I was a fool to fall for a man like you.

200
00:15:39,252 --> 00:15:40,853
你送她沙克  要肯定她回到家
Go with her, Sascha. Be sure she gets home.

201
00:15:40,953 --> 00:15:42,648
是的  老板 然后马上回来
And come right back.

202
00:15:42,655 --> 00:15:44,122
是  老板
Yes, boss.

203
00:15:55,935 --> 00:15:57,562
哈罗  瑞克 路易
- Hello, Rick. - Hello, Louis.

204
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:00,034
你真奢侈  这样把女人抛开
How extravagant you are, throwing away women.

205
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:01,934
有一天她们可能会渐渐消失
Someday they may be scarce.

206
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:04,375
我想现在我该去拜访伊娃
I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne.

207
00:16:04,577 --> 00:16:06,169
或许可藉反作用占到便宜
Maybe get her on the rebound.

208
00:16:06,345 --> 00:16:08,472
一讲到女人 你就是不折不扣的民主党
When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.

209
00:16:08,948 --> 00:16:13,783
(法语)

210
00:16:18,758 --> 00:16:21,727
如果他听得明白一个字 意大利将大获全胜
If he gets a word in, it'll be a major Italian victory.

211
00:16:26,098 --> 00:16:27,759
往里斯本的飞机
The plane to Lisbon.

212
00:16:32,438 --> 00:16:34,235
你会想坐在里面
You would like to be on it?

213
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,101
为什么?  里斯本有什么好?
Why? What's in Lisbon?

214
00:16:36,442 --> 00:16:38,342
到美国的快航
The clipper to America.

215
00:16:38,544 --> 00:16:41,240
我常思索为什么你不返回美国
I've often speculated on why you don't return to America.

216
00:16:41,447 --> 00:16:45,708
你卷走教堂的基金逃吗?  你跟参议员的太太私奔?
Did you abscond with the church funds? Did you run off with a senator's wife?

217
00:16:45,785 --> 00:16:48,447
我喜欢想像你杀了人 这满足我浪漫的遐想
Llike to think you killed a man. It's the romantic in me.

218
00:16:48,654 --> 00:16:50,315
是三者的综合
It's a combination of all three.

219
00:16:50,523 --> 00:16:52,957
到底是什么带你到卡萨布兰卡
And what in heavers name brought you to Casablanca?

220
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,885
我的健康  我来卡萨布兰卡 是为了这地方的水
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.

221
00:16:55,895 --> 00:16:59,058
水?  什么水?  我们在沙漠里
The waters? What waters? We're in the desert.

222
00:16:59,632 --> 00:17:01,463
我的消息错误
I was misinformed.

223
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,401
对不起!  瑞克先生
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick.

224
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:08,404
里面一位先生赢了两万块法O
A gentleman inside has won 20,000 francs...

225
00:17:08,774 --> 00:17:10,969
出纳需要一些钱
...and the cashier would like some money.

226
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:13,573
我从保险柜拿
I'll get it from the safe.

227
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:15,304
我好难过  瑞克先生
I'm so upset, Rick. You know l- -

228
00:17:15,514 --> 00:17:18,108
别提了  艾米 这种事常常发生
Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.

229
00:17:18,317 --> 00:17:20,080
我非常抱歉
I'm awfully sorry.

230
00:17:25,658 --> 00:17:27,321
瑞克 今晚这里会有点刺激的事
Rick, there will be some excitement here tonight.

231
00:17:27,328 --> 00:17:29,321
我们将在你的咖啡馆逮捕人
An arrest in your cafe.

232
00:17:29,495 --> 00:17:31,224
什么?  又一次?  这不是普通的逮捕
- Again? - This is no ordinary arrest.

233
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,795
是谋杀犯
A murderer, no less.

234
00:17:33,432 --> 00:17:37,136
如果你想要警告他 别让自己不方便 你逃不过监视的
If you're thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot escape.

235
00:17:37,236 --> 00:17:40,506
我不为任何人冒险的 明智的外交政策
- I stick my neck out for nobody. - A wise foreign policy.

236
00:17:40,606 --> 00:17:44,633
(法语)

237
00:17:44,777 --> 00:17:47,302
我们本可以在今晚较早时 在蓝鹦鹉进行逮捕
Could have made the arrest earlier, at the Blue Parrot.

238
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,607
为了表示我对你的敬意 我们在这里进行
Out of my regard for you, we're staging it here.

239
00:17:49,782 --> 00:17:51,249
可以带给你的顾客一点娱乐
It will amuse your customers.

240
00:17:51,884 --> 00:17:53,943
我们的娱乐节目已经够多了
Our entertainment's enough.

241
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:56,580
瑞克  今晚我们这里有名贵客
We're to have an important guest here tonight.

242
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:59,257
第三帝国的史查沙少校
Major Strasser of the Third Reich, no less.

243
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,619
我们进行逮捕时希望他在场
We want him to be here when we make the arrest.

244
00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:04,354
以示范一下我办事的效率
A demonstration of the efficiency of my administration.

245
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,464
我明白 史查沙来这里干什么?
I see. And what's Strasser doing here?

246
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,568
他不可能老远来到卡萨布兰卡
He certainly didn't come here...

247
00:18:08,576 --> 00:18:10,568
为了目击你的办事效率吧?
...to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.

248
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:11,862
或许不是 拿去吧
- Perhaps not. - Here.

249
00:18:12,071 --> 00:18:14,164
不会再发生了 没关系
- It shall not happen again. - That's all right.

250
00:18:14,373 --> 00:18:17,206
我知道你心里有事情 何不直接说出来?
Louis, you got something on your mind. Why don't you spill it.

251
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,877
你观察力真好
How observant you are.

252
00:18:19,245 --> 00:18:21,941
事实上我想劝告你一声
As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.

253
00:18:22,114 --> 00:18:23,081
是吗?
Yeah?

254
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,680
要喝白兰地吗?  谢谢
- Have a brandy? - Thank you.

255
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:29,288
瑞克  在这咖啡馆里 有很多出境证卖出去
There are many exit visas sold in this cafe,

256
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:31,288
不过我们知道你一张也没卖过
but we know that you've never sold one.

257
00:18:31,324 --> 00:18:33,485
所以我们才准许你营业
That is the reason we permit you to remain open.

258
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:35,957
我还以为是我让你在轮盘赢钱
I thought it was because llet you win at roulette.

259
00:18:36,128 --> 00:18:37,356
那是另一个原因
That is another reason.

260
00:18:37,563 --> 00:18:40,327
有一个要前往美国的人 已抵达卡萨布兰卡
There is a man arrived in Casablanca on his way to America.

261
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:43,400
他会给任何提供他出境证的人 一大笔钱
He will offer a fortune to anyone who'll furnish an exit visa.

262
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:46,332
他叫什么名字?  维多拉斯路
- What's his name? - Victor Laszlo.

263
00:18:46,472 --> 00:18:47,871
维多拉斯路?
Victor Laszlo?

264
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,634
瑞克  这是我第一次看到 有人如此令你着迷
Rick, that is the first time I've seen you so impressed.

265
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,778
半个地球的人都为他着迷
He's succeeded in impressing half the world.

266
00:18:52,978 --> 00:18:55,715
我的责任就是阻止 另一半的地球人不再为他着迷
It's my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half.

267
00:18:55,815 --> 00:18:59,785
瑞克  拉斯路绝不能踏足美国 他要留在卡萨布兰卡
Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.

268
00:18:59,885 --> 00:19:01,853
看他如何达成将很有趣
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.

269
00:19:02,054 --> 00:19:04,181
达成什么?  他的逃亡
- Manages what? - His escape.

270
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,424
我刚才告诉你...
- But I just told you... - Stop it.

271
00:19:05,524 --> 00:19:10,157
够了  他从集中营逃出来 纳粹党在欧洲到处追捕他
He escaped from a concentration camp. The Nazis have chased him all over Europe.

272
00:19:10,262 --> 00:19:11,593
这是追捕的最终站
This is the end of the chase.

273
00:19:11,797 --> 00:19:14,391
赌两万法O  不是
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.

274
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:15,930
这是认真的吗?
Is that a serious offer?

275
00:19:16,302 --> 00:19:18,463
我刚赔了两万  我想赚回来
I just paid out 20, and I' d like to get it back.

276
00:19:18,804 --> 00:19:21,466
加到十万吧!  我只是个贫穷的腐败官吏
Make it 10. I'm only a poor corrupt official.

277
00:19:22,274 --> 00:19:23,468
好吧 成交
- Okay. - Done.

278
00:19:23,676 --> 00:19:26,047
不管他多聪明 他仍然需要一份出境许可证
No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa.

279
00:19:26,056 --> 00:19:28,047
或许我该说是两份
Or I should say two.

280
00:19:28,147 --> 00:19:30,138
为什么是两份?  他跟一位女士一起旅行
- Why two? - He is traveling with a lady.

281
00:19:30,383 --> 00:19:33,286
一份他也会要的 我不认为  我看过那位女士
- He'll take one. - I think not. I' ve seen the lady.

282
00:19:33,386 --> 00:19:36,014
如果他没把她留在马赛或奥朗
And if he did not leave her in Marseilles or Oran...

283
00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:38,648
肯定不会把她留在卡萨布兰卡
...he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.

284
00:19:38,858 --> 00:19:40,985
或许他没有你那么浪漫
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.

285
00:19:41,193 --> 00:19:44,424
都一样  他不会拿到出境证
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.

286
00:19:45,064 --> 00:19:48,659
是什么使你觉得我可能有兴趣 帮忙拉斯路逃亡
What ever gave you the impression that I might help Laszlo escape?

287
00:19:49,034 --> 00:19:52,197
因为  亲爱的瑞克 我怀疑在那愤世嫉俗的外表下
Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell...

288
00:19:52,371 --> 00:19:54,100
你的内心是个性情中人
...you are at heart a sentimentalist.

289
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,810
你要笑随便你 不过我凑巧熟知你的记录
Laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record.

290
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:00,003
让我举出两项
Let me point out just two items:

291
00:20:00,346 --> 00:20:04,411
在1935年 你运枪械到衣索匹亚
In 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia.

292
00:20:04,517 --> 00:20:08,419
在1936年  你在西班牙 替反佛朗哥派打仗
In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.

293
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:10,919
二次我都得到丰厚的酬劳
And got well paid for it on both occasions.

294
00:20:11,123 --> 00:20:13,421
胜方本可以给你更好的酬劳
The winning side would have paid you much better.

295
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:14,826
或许吧
Maybe.

296
00:20:15,895 --> 00:20:18,090
似乎你坚决 要把拉斯路留在这里
It seems you're determined to keep Laszlo here.

297
00:20:18,297 --> 00:20:20,060
我奉命行事
I have my orders.

298
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,698
我明白了  德国秘密警察
I see. Gestapo spank.

299
00:20:22,902 --> 00:20:25,700
亲爱的瑞克 你高估了秘密警察的影响力了
My dear Ricky, you overestimate the influence of the Gestapo.

300
00:20:25,905 --> 00:20:29,238
我不干涉他们 他们也不干涉我
I don't interfere with them, and they don't interfere with me.

301
00:20:29,442 --> 00:20:31,535
在卡萨布兰卡 我掌握自己的命运
In Casablanca, I am master of my fate.

302
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,837
史查沙少校来了  长官
- I am... - Major Strasser is here, sir.

303
00:20:34,013 --> 00:20:36,273
才刚说完 失陪
- You were saying? - Excuse me.

304
00:20:46,058 --> 00:20:49,362
卡尔 给史查沙少校最好的位子 靠近女士们的
Carl, see that Major Strasser gets a good table, close to the ladies.

305
00:20:49,462 --> 00:20:51,358
我已经给他最好的了
I have already given him the best,

306
00:20:51,462 --> 00:20:54,058
知道他是德国人 反正他一定接受
knowing he is German and would take it anyway.

307
00:20:56,202 --> 00:20:58,471
静静地逮捕的 每个门口派两个守卫
Take him quietly. Two guards at every door.

308
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:06,300
一切都准备好了  长官 去吧
- Everything is ready, sir. - Go ahead.

309
00:21:12,051 --> 00:21:14,383
晚安  先生 晚安  队长
- Good evening, gentlemen. - Good evening, captain.

310
00:21:14,553 --> 00:21:16,578
要一块坐吗?  谢谢
- Wort you join us? - Thank you.

311
00:21:17,656 --> 00:21:21,423
很荣幸你光临本店 香槟和鱼子酱
- It 's a pleasure to have you here, major. - Champagne and a tin of caviar.

312
00:21:21,594 --> 00:21:24,530
容我推荐华提可 很好的法国酒
May I recommend Veuve Clicquot '26, a good French wine.

313
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:27,098
谢谢 好的  先生
Very well, sir.

314
00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:30,731
很有趣的俱乐部 特别是今晚  长官
- A very interesting club. - Especially so tonight, major.

315
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:34,431
在几分钟后你将会看到 那个谋杀你快递员的人
In a few minutes you'll see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.

316
00:21:34,607 --> 00:21:36,097
我正期待如此  队长
I expected no less, captain.

317
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,933
尤佳迪先生
Monsieur Ugarte.

318
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,979
请你跟我们走!  当然
- Will you please come with us? - Certainly.

319
00:21:44,717 --> 00:21:46,582
我可否先把筹码换回现金?
May I first please cash my chips?

320
00:21:53,692 --> 00:21:58,492
运气不错呢 两千  麻烦你 两千
Very lucky, huh? Two thousand, please.

321
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,184
瑞克  瑞克  救我
Rick! Rick, help me!

322
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:26,247
别傻了  你逃不掉的 瑞克  把我藏起来  想办法
- Don't be a fool. You can't get away. - But, Rick, hide me. Do something!

323
00:22:32,164 --> 00:22:33,461
非常好  队长
Excellent, captain.

324
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:36,294
当他们来抓我时 希望你多尽点力
When they come for me, I hope you'll be more of a help.

325
00:22:36,468 --> 00:22:38,561
我不为任何人冒险
I stick my neck out for nobody.

326
00:22:38,837 --> 00:22:42,707
很抱歉有点骚乱  各位 不过全过去了  一切平安无事
I'm sorry there was a disturbance, folks, but it's all over now.

327
00:22:42,808 --> 00:22:47,073
尽管坐下来  尽情享受 好了  山姆 好的  老板
Just sit down and have a good time. Enjoy yourselves. All right, Sam.

328
00:22:54,153 --> 00:22:57,589
瑞克  这位是第三帝国的 海米勒史查沙少校
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.

329
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,690
你好吗?  瑞克先生 你好吗?
- How do you do, Mr. Rick? - How do you do?

330
00:22:59,858 --> 00:23:01,985
你已经认识的 第三帝国的哈斯先生
You already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.

331
00:23:02,194 --> 00:23:04,662
请一块坐  瑞克先生
Please join us, Mr. Rick.

332
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:09,825
今晚我们非常荣幸
We are very honored tonight.

333
00:23:10,002 --> 00:23:14,166
第三帝国的名声 部分是史查沙少校的功劳
Major Strasser is one of the reasons the Third Reich enjoys the reputation it has.

334
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,309
他一直重复第三帝国 好像你预料会有别的一样
You repeat Third Reich as though you expected there to be others.

335
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:20,103
少校  私底下我会来者不拒
Well, personally, major, I will take what comes.

336
00:23:21,246 --> 00:23:23,271
你介意我问你一些问题吗?
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

337
00:23:23,515 --> 00:23:26,082
当然  非正式的 如果你喜欢大可正式的问
- Unofficially, of course. - Make it official if you like.

338
00:23:26,251 --> 00:23:29,447
你的国籍是什么?  我是个醉酒鬼
- What is your nationality? - I' m a drunkard.

339
00:23:30,456 --> 00:23:32,447
那使瑞克成为世界公民
And that makes Rick a citizen of the world.

340
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:35,282
我在纽约市出生 如果这对你有帮助
I was born in New York City, if that'll help you any.

341
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:39,024
我知道你在巴黎被占领时 从巴黎来到这里
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.

342
00:23:39,198 --> 00:23:40,961
那似乎不是什么秘密
There seems to be no secret about that.

343
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,404
你是不是那些无法想像心爱的巴黎
Are you one of those people...

344
00:23:43,406 --> 00:23:45,404
被德国人进占的人其中之一
...who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?

345
00:23:45,504 --> 00:23:47,734
我没有特别钟情巴黎
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.

346
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,805
你能想像我们占据伦敦吗?
Can you imagine us in London?

347
00:23:50,943 --> 00:23:52,410
你到那里之后再问我吧
When you get there, ask me.

348
00:23:52,911 --> 00:23:54,071
有外交手腕
Diplomatist.

349
00:23:54,246 --> 00:23:55,406
那纽约呢?
How about New York?

350
00:23:55,581 --> 00:24:00,477
在纽约有某些区域  我不会建议你尝试侵入
There are sections of New York, major that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.

351
00:24:00,986 --> 00:24:03,982
你认为谁会打胜仗?  我一点也不清楚
- Who do you think will win the war? - I haven't the slightest idea.

352
00:24:04,023 --> 00:24:06,825
瑞克对一切都采中立态度
Rick is completely neutral about everything.

353
00:24:08,894 --> 00:24:13,664
他并非一直那么小心保持中立 我们有你的完整档案
You were not always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.

354
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,166
理查宾勒  美国人  三十七岁 不能返回本国
"Richard Blaine, American. Age: 37. Cannot return to his country."

355
00:24:19,938 --> 00:24:23,008
原因有点含糊 我们也知道你在巴黎做什么
The reason is a little vague. We also know what you did in Paris.

356
00:24:23,108 --> 00:24:24,677
也知道你为何离开巴黎  别担心  我们不会拿去广播
And also we know why you left Paris. Don't worry, we're not going to broadcast it.

357
00:24:25,346 --> 00:24:08,825
对女人方面也一样
And that takes in the field of women too.

358
00:24:27,012 --> 00:24:28,240
我的眼睛真的是棕色吗?
Are my eyes really brown?

359
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:30,416
请原谅我的好奇心  宾勒先生  重点是
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is...

360
00:24:30,516 --> 00:24:34,047
帝国的一位敌人 已来到卡萨布兰卡
...an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca...

361
00:24:34,219 --> 00:24:37,188
我们正查问任何能帮我们的人
...and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.

362
00:24:37,423 --> 00:24:41,416
我对拉斯路去留与否的兴趣 纯粹是赌博的关系
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.

363
00:24:42,294 --> 00:24:45,529
这样说来 你对奸诈的狐狸毫不同情
In this case you have no sympathy for the fox?

364
00:24:45,597 --> 00:24:49,300
不特别同情 我也了解猎犬的立场
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound too.

365
00:24:49,334 --> 00:24:52,235
维多拉斯路在布拉格的报纸 刊登最无耻的谎言
Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers...

366
00:24:52,404 --> 00:24:54,073
一直到我们进占那一天 甚至在之后还有
...until the day we marched in.

367
00:24:54,173 --> 00:24:25,336
他在一地窖中 继续印毁损的传单
And even after that, he continued to print scandal sheets in his cellar.

368
00:24:58,711 --> 00:25:01,373
当然  不得不承认他勇气可嘉
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.

369
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,850
我承认他很聪明 在巴黎他三次逃过我们的掌心
I admit he's clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers.

370
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:08,952
他继续他的活动 我们决意不让这种事再发生
In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.

371
00:25:09,054 --> 00:25:12,656
对不起  你们的生意是政治 而我的生意是经营酒馆
Excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics, mine is running a saloon.

372
00:25:12,725 --> 00:25:14,556
晚安  宾勒先生
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.

373
00:25:15,227 --> 00:25:17,695
你看到了  少校 瑞克你一点也不必担心
You see, major? You have nothing to worry about Rick.

374
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,462
或许吧
Perhaps.

375
00:25:24,703 --> 00:25:28,870
我订了一个位子  维多拉斯路  -拉斯路先生  这边走
- I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo. - Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. Right this way.

376
00:25:55,734 --> 00:25:57,202
两杯"君度"  麻烦你
Two Cointreaux, please.

377
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:01,971
我没看到尤佳迪形容的人
I saw no one of Ugarte's description.

378
00:26:02,241 --> 00:26:05,233
维多 我感觉我们不该留在这里
Victor, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.

379
00:26:05,444 --> 00:26:08,379
如果我们现在走出去 只会引人注目
If we would walk out so soon it would only call attention to us.

380
00:26:08,547 --> 00:26:11,744
或许尤佳迪在咖啡馆的另一边
Perhaps Ugarte is in some other part of the cafe.

381
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:16,248
对不起  你们像是 正要前往美国的夫妇
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.

382
00:26:16,655 --> 00:26:19,023
在那里这戒指会有市场
You'll find a market there for this ring.

383
00:26:19,025 --> 00:26:21,023
我被迫卖掉它是个巨大的牺牲
I'm forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.

384
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,227
谢谢  我没想过买  或许买给女士
- Thank you, but I hardly think... - Perhaps for the lady.

385
00:26:22,327 --> 00:26:25,592
这戒指独一无二
The ring is quite unique.

386
00:26:27,466 --> 00:26:31,564
好  我很感兴趣 好
- Yes, I' m very interested. - Good.

387
00:26:31,703 --> 00:26:32,692
你叫什么名字?
What is your name?

388
00:26:32,938 --> 00:26:35,202
贝加  挪威人  听候差遣
Berger, Norwegian. At your service, sir.

389
00:26:35,874 --> 00:26:36,709
维多

390
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:38,970
几分钟后我在酒吧跟你会面
I'll meet you in a few minutes at the bar.

391
00:26:39,178 --> 00:26:41,742
不  我不想买戒指 谢谢你给我们看
We don't want the ring, but thanks for showing it to us.

392
00:26:41,914 --> 00:26:45,616
那么便宜  不过你决定了 对不起  我决定了
- Such a bargain. But that is your decision? - I' m sorry, it is.

393
00:26:47,786 --> 00:26:49,913
是拉斯路先生吗?  是
- Monsieur Laszlo, is it not? - Yes?

394
00:26:50,122 --> 00:26:52,090
我是雷诺队长  警察首长
I am Captain Renault, prefect of police.

395
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:53,451
是  你想要什么?
Yes, what is it you want?

396
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:56,753
我欢迎你来到卡萨布兰卡 并祝你在这里住得愉快
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay.

397
00:26:56,962 --> 00:26:59,658
我们并不常有这么特出的访客
It isn't often we have so distinguished a visitor.

398
00:26:59,865 --> 00:27:02,299
谢谢  我希望你原谅我  队长
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, captain.

399
00:27:02,501 --> 00:27:05,959
目前的法国行政当局 并非一直那么友善
The present French administration hasn't always been so cordial.

400
00:27:06,205 --> 00:27:08,070
容我介绍伊莎琳小姐
May I present Miss llsa Lund.

401
00:27:09,842 --> 00:27:12,743
我听说你是卡萨布兰卡有史以来最美丽的女访客
I was told you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca.

402
00:27:12,911 --> 00:27:14,708
那是粗略又保守的说法
That was a gross understatement.

403
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,169
你太客气了
You're very kind.

404
00:27:16,415 --> 00:27:17,516
－一起坐吧 -如果你准许我
- Wort you join us? - Lf you will permit me.

405
00:27:19,318 --> 00:27:21,954
艾米  给我一瓶最好的香槟 记在我的帐上
Oh, no, Emile, please. A bottle of your best champagne. And put it on my bill.

406
00:27:22,054 --> 00:27:23,316
好的，先生 队长

407
00:27:23,422 --> 00:27:25,693
先生  这是我们玩的一种游戏
It's a game we play.

408
00:27:25,694 --> 00:27:28,693
他们记在帐单上 我撕毁帐单非常方便
They put it on the bill, I tear up the bill. It is very convenient.

409
00:27:29,528 --> 00:27:32,326
队长  弹琴的那个人
Captain, the boy who's playing the piano...

410
00:27:32,998 --> 00:27:34,465
我好像在那里看过
Somewhere I' ve seen him.

411
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:36,156
山姆?  是
- Sam? - Yes.

412
00:27:36,368 --> 00:27:38,097
他跟瑞克一起从巴黎来
He came from Paris with Rick.

413
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,737
瑞克?  他是谁?
Rick? Who is he?

414
00:27:39,905 --> 00:27:43,504
女士  你正在瑞克咖啡馆 瑞克是... 他是什么?
- Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's. Rick is... - Is what?

415
00:27:43,508 --> 00:27:46,904
女士  他是那种... 如果我是女人的话
Mademoiselle, he's the kind of man that, well, if I were a woman...

416
00:27:46,979 --> 00:27:49,675
我应该会爱上他的男人
...and I were not around, I should be in love with Rick.

417
00:27:49,882 --> 00:27:53,374
我真是个傻瓜 我对一位美丽女人说别的男人
But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.

418
00:27:54,853 --> 00:27:56,877
失陪 少校
Excuse me. Major.

419
00:27:59,424 --> 00:28:02,623
林小姐 拉斯路先生  让我介绍 海米勒史查沙少校
Mademoiselle Lund and Monsieur Laszlo, may I present Major Strasser.

420
00:28:02,728 --> 00:28:03,717
你好吗?
How do you do?

421
00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:05,897
我盼望这份荣幸很久了
This is a pleasure I have looked forward to.

422
00:28:06,131 --> 00:28:08,622
我肯定你会原谅我不够亲切
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I' m not gracious.

423
00:28:08,834 --> 00:28:10,961
不过你明白  史查沙少校 我是捷克人
You see, Major Strasser, I am a Czechoslovakian.

424
00:28:11,236 --> 00:28:15,930
你以前的捷克人 现在 你是第三帝国统治下的人民
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich.

425
00:28:16,441 --> 00:28:20,034
我从不曾接受这份优待 而现在我站在法国的土地上
I have never accepted that privilege. And I' m now on French soil.

426
00:28:20,112 --> 00:28:23,878
我想跟你讨论一下 你在法国土地上引起的问题
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.

427
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:25,676
时间和地点都不太适当
This is hardly the time or place.

428
00:28:25,884 --> 00:28:30,389
那我们另订时间和地点好了 明天十点在首长的办公室
Then we shall state another time and place. Tomorrow at 10 in the prefect's office.

429
00:28:30,489 --> 00:28:31,717
好吗?  小姐
With mademoiselle.

430
00:28:33,358 --> 00:28:36,418
雷诺队长  我在你管辖之下
Captain, I am under your authority.

431
00:28:36,595 --> 00:28:38,620
到你的办公室是你的命令吗?
Is it your order that we come to your office?

432
00:28:38,864 --> 00:28:42,732
让我说这是我的请求好了 那样的字眼比较好听
Let us say it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.

433
00:28:42,935 --> 00:28:44,232
好吧 小姐
Very well.

434
00:28:45,003 --> 00:28:46,402
后会有期

435
00:28:48,407 --> 00:28:51,433
很聪明的策略性让步  少校
A very clever tactical retreat, major.

436
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:56,143
这一次他们决意要阻止我 维多  我替你感到害怕
- This time they really mean to stop me. - Victor, I' m afraid for you.

437
00:28:56,148 --> 00:28:58,810
我们以前也曾身处困境 不是吗?
We've been in difficult places before, haven't we?

438
00:29:32,117 --> 00:29:34,051
我必须查出贝加知道的事
I must find out what Berger knows.

439
00:29:34,252 --> 00:29:37,449
小心点 我会
- Be careful. - I will. Don't worry.

440
00:29:55,307 --> 00:29:58,537
贝加先生 那戒指我可以再看吗?  可以 先生
Monsieur Berger, the ring. Could I see it again?

441
00:29:58,577 --> 00:30:00,135
请来一杯香槟鸡尾酒
Champagne cocktail, please.

442
00:30:00,979 --> 00:30:03,709
我从报上的照片认得你的相貌 拉斯路先生
I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.

443
00:30:03,882 --> 00:30:06,851
在集中营里想不消瘦也很难
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.

444
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:09,988
我们看过五次报导你被杀死 在五个不同的地方
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.

445
00:30:10,222 --> 00:30:13,055
每一次都是真实的
As you see, it was true every single time.

446
00:30:13,258 --> 00:30:14,748
谢天谢地  我找到你  贝加
Thank heaven I found you, Berger.

447
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,026
我在找一个叫尤佳迪的人 他预定是要帮我的
I'm looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He's supposed to help me.

448
00:30:19,164 --> 00:30:21,428
尤佳迪自身难保
Ugarte cannot even help himself.

449
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:26,338
他因谋杀罪被逮捕了 他今晚在这里被捕的
He's under arrest for murder. He was arrested here tonight.

450
00:30:26,438 --> 00:30:27,564
我明白了
I see.

451
00:30:28,073 --> 00:30:32,303
不过我们还是自由之身 我们可以尽力 我们有组织
But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized.

452
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,505
在地下  就像其他地方一样
Underground, like everywhere else.

453
00:30:34,713 --> 00:30:37,511
明天晚上有一个会议
Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois.

454
00:30:37,883 --> 00:30:39,510
如果你会来... 先生
If you will come...

455
00:30:53,031 --> 00:30:55,363
可否请弹钢琴的过来一下?
Will you ask the piano player to come over here?

456
00:30:55,534 --> 00:30:57,661
好的  小姐
Very well, mademoiselle.

457
00:30:59,805 --> 00:31:03,208
珠宝生意如何?  贝加 不太好  请替我结帐
- How's the jewelry business, Berger? - Not so good. Check, please.

458
00:31:03,308 --> 00:31:04,645
真可惜你不早点来这里
Too bad you werert here earlier.

459
00:31:04,648 --> 00:31:06,645
今天晚上我们有一点刺激呢?  对不对?  贝加
We had quite a bit of excitement, didn't we, Berger?

460
00:31:06,745 --> 00:31:09,236
对  失陪
Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.

461
00:31:09,381 --> 00:31:13,484
我的帐单 不用 两杯香槟鸡尾酒  拜托
- My bill. - No. Two champagne cocktails. Please.

462
00:31:17,489 --> 00:31:19,787
哈罗  山姆 哈罗  小姐
- Hello, Sam. - Hello, Miss llsa.

463
00:31:19,991 --> 00:31:22,459
我从没想过会再看到你
I never expected to see you again.

464
00:31:22,994 --> 00:31:24,896
已经很久了
It's been a long time.

465
00:31:24,996 --> 00:31:29,066
是的  小姐 过去的事有如逝水
Yes, ma'am. Alot of water under the bridge.

466
00:31:29,935 --> 00:31:33,395
来一些旧日的歌  山姆 是  小姐
- Some of the old songs, Sam. - Yes, ma'am.

467
00:31:42,948 --> 00:31:43,915
瑞克在那里?
Where is Rick?

468
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:47,017
我不知道  我整晚没看到他
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.

469
00:31:48,053 --> 00:31:49,254
他什么时候回来?  今晚不会  他不会回来
- When will he be back? - Not tonight no more. He ain't coming...

470
00:31:49,354 --> 00:31:53,319
他回家了
He went home.

471
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,719
他常常这么早就走吗?  他从不
- Does he always leave so early? - He never...

472
00:31:57,863 --> 00:32:00,263
他有位女友在蓝鹦鹉
Well, he's got a girl up to the Blue Parrot.

473
00:32:00,465 --> 00:32:02,558
他常常上那儿
Goes up there all the time.

474
00:32:04,136 --> 00:32:06,798
你以前比较会撒谎  山姆
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.

475
00:32:07,739 --> 00:32:11,736
别去打扰他  伊莎小姐 你为他带来恶运
Leave him alone, Miss llsa. You're bad luck to him.

476
00:32:13,912 --> 00:32:16,881
弹一次  山姆  看在往日份上
Play it once, Sam. For old times' sake.

477
00:32:17,082 --> 00:32:19,448
我不知道你是什么意思?  伊莎小姐
I don't know what you mean, Miss llsa.

478
00:32:20,051 --> 00:32:21,541
弹吧  山姆
Play it, Sam.

479
00:32:22,554 --> 00:32:24,545
弹"时光飞逝"
Play "As Time Goes By."

480
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:28,953
我记不起来了  伊莎小姐 我有点生锈了
I can't remember it, Miss llsa. I'm a little rusty on it.

481
00:32:29,027 --> 00:32:30,995
我替你哼调子
I'll hum it for you.

482
00:32:42,674 --> 00:32:44,073
唱出来  山姆
Sing it, Sam.

483
00:33:30,222 --> 00:33:32,986
山姆 我想我告诉过你永远别弹
Sam, I thought I told you never to play...

484
00:33:43,635 --> 00:33:46,604
你刚才问及瑞克  他来了 林小姐  让我来介绍
Well, you were asking about Rick, and here he is. May I present...

485
00:33:46,805 --> 00:33:49,103
哈罗  伊莎 哈罗  瑞克
- Hello, llsa. - Hello, Rick.

486
00:33:49,307 --> 00:33:52,903
你已经认识瑞克了  小姐 那  或许你也...
Oh, you've already met Rick, mademoiselle? Then perhaps you also...

487
00:33:53,011 --> 00:33:54,342
这位是拉斯路先生
This is Mr. Laszlo.

488
00:33:54,546 --> 00:33:55,911
你好吗?  你好
- How do you do? - How do you do?

489
00:33:56,314 --> 00:33:58,373
在卡萨布兰卡听到很多你的事
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.

490
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,547
而维多拉斯路的事到处可闻
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.

491
00:34:00,752 --> 00:34:02,954
跟我们喝一杯好吗?  不  瑞克从不...
- Wort you join us for a drink? - Rick never...

492
00:34:03,054 --> 00:34:04,022
谢谢  我会
- Thanks, I will. - Well...

493
00:34:04,122 --> 00:34:08,025
一项惯例打破了  艾米!
...a precedent is being broken. Emile.

494
00:34:08,827 --> 00:34:12,386
这是很别致的咖啡馆 我恭喜你 我恭喜你
- Interesting cafe. I congratulate you. - I congratulate you.

495
00:34:12,497 --> 00:34:13,987
为了什么?  你的工作
- What for? - Your work.

496
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,894
谢谢  我尽力而为
Thank you. I try.

497
00:34:16,801 --> 00:34:18,701
人家都尽力而为  而你成功了
We all try. You succeed.

498
00:34:18,937 --> 00:34:21,908
我不太明白你们两个 她早先在问关于你的事
She was asking about you earlier,

499
00:34:21,937 --> 00:34:24,508
那种态度使我非常嫉妒
Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.

500
00:34:24,643 --> 00:34:26,133
我不肯定是你
I wasrt sure you were the same.

501
00:34:26,911 --> 00:34:30,414
我想想看 我们最后一次见面是 "美丽的晨晕"
- Let's see, the last time we met... - Was La Belle Aurore.

502
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:33,283
太好了  你记得
How nice. You remembered.

503
00:34:33,451 --> 00:34:36,249
不过那天正好是德国军队 开进巴黎的日子
But, of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.

504
00:34:36,454 --> 00:34:39,286
不容易忘记的日子 不容易
Not an easy day to forget.

505
00:34:39,391 --> 00:34:43,122
我记得每一个细节 德国人穿灰色  你穿蓝色
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.

506
00:34:44,529 --> 00:34:47,123
对  我把那件衣服收起来了
Yes. I put that dress away.

507
00:34:47,332 --> 00:34:49,664
当德国人撤离后  我会再穿
When the Germans march out I'll wear it again.

508
00:34:49,868 --> 00:34:54,270
瑞克  你变得较人性化了 我猜我们必须感谢你
Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that.

509
00:34:54,372 --> 00:34:57,603
伊莎  我不想扫兴 不过时候不早了
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.

510
00:34:57,809 --> 00:35:00,545
的确是  在卡萨布兰卡有戒严
So it is. We have a curfew in Casablanca.

511
00:35:00,645 --> 00:35:04,749
警察首长可不能被发现喝醉酒神智不清
It would never do for the chief of police to be found drinking after hours.

512
00:35:04,849 --> 00:35:07,181
我希望你不介意 一点也不
- I hope we didn't overstay our welcome. - Not at all.

513
00:35:07,485 --> 00:35:09,187
你的帐单  先生 让我付 我请客
- Your check, sir. - It 's my party.

514
00:35:09,287 --> 00:35:12,890
又一个惯例打破了 这是一个很有趣的晚上
Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening.

515
00:35:13,058 --> 00:35:16,994
我替你叫计程车 在晚上汽油要配给
I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.

516
00:35:17,162 --> 00:35:18,891
我们会再来 随时欢迎
- We'll come again. - Anytime.

517
00:35:19,097 --> 00:35:21,122
替我跟山姆说晚安 我会
- Say good night to Sam for me. - I will.

518
00:35:22,133 --> 00:35:26,126
世界上没有人能像山姆那样 弹"时光飞逝"
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.

519
00:35:26,705 --> 00:35:29,173
他有好久没弹这首歌了
He hasn't played it in a long time.

520
00:35:30,675 --> 00:35:32,711
晚安 晚安
- Good night. - Good night.

521
00:35:32,811 --> 00:35:34,438
晚安
Night.

522
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,788
这个瑞克叫人莫名其妙 他是什么人?
A very puzzling fellow, this Rick. What sort is he?

523
00:35:45,023 --> 00:35:48,220
我也说不上来 虽然在巴黎我常看到他
I really can't say, though I saw him quite often in Paris.

524
00:35:48,426 --> 00:35:51,062
明天十点在首长的办公室 我们会去的 晚安
- Tomorrow at 10, at the prefect office. - We'll be there.

525
00:35:51,162 --> 00:35:52,857
晚安
- Good night. - Good night.

526
00:36:31,703 --> 00:36:33,193
老板
Boss?

527
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:38,809
老板 是
- Boss? - Yeah?

528
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:42,573
你要不要上床睡?  现在不要
- Boss, ain't you going to bed? - Not right now.

529
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,482
你会在短时间内上床睡吗?
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?

530
00:36:45,784 --> 00:36:47,809
晚一点你会上床睡吗?  不
- You ever going to bed? - No.

531
00:36:48,653 --> 00:36:50,484
我也不困
Well, I ain't sleepy, either.

532
00:36:50,688 --> 00:36:51,848
好  来喝一杯吧
Good, then have a drink.

533
00:36:52,056 --> 00:36:53,990
不  我不要  老板 那就别喝
- Not me, boss. - Then don't have a drink.

534
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:55,683
老板  我们离开这里吧
Boss, let's get out of here.

535
00:36:55,927 --> 00:36:58,418
不  山姆  我在等一位女士
No, sir. I' m waiting for a lady.

536
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:01,190
拜托  我们走吧 这里除了麻烦之外什么也没有
Please, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.

537
00:37:01,433 --> 00:37:03,401
她回来了  我知道她回来了
She's coming back. I know she's coming back.

538
00:37:03,568 --> 00:37:05,263
我们开车去  开一整个晚上
We'll take the car and drive all night.

539
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:08,303
我们去喝酒 我们也可去钓鱼  躲开一下 直到她离开
We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing, stay away until she's gone.

540
00:37:08,473 --> 00:37:13,410
闭嘴  回家去好吗?  不  先生  我要留在这里
- Shut up and go home, will you? - No, sir, I' m staying right here.

541
00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:20,840
他们抓了尤佳迪 然后她走进来
They grab Ugarte, then she walks in.

542
00:37:21,286 --> 00:37:24,949
自然法则  一进一出
That's the way it goes. One in, one out.

543
00:37:25,924 --> 00:37:28,017
山姆 是的  老板
- Sam. - Yes, boss?

544
00:37:28,526 --> 00:37:31,363
卡萨布兰卡现在是1941年12月  在纽约是什么时候?
If it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?

545
00:37:31,463 --> 00:37:34,566
什么?
What?

546
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:36,133
我的手表停了
My watch stopped.

547
00:37:36,968 --> 00:37:39,163
我打赌在纽约他们都睡着了
I bet they're asleep in New York.

548
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:42,100
我打赌全美国的人都睡着了
I bet they're asleep all over America.

549
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,078
全世界有那么多城镇 有那么多酒吧
Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world...

550
00:37:53,251 --> 00:37:55,242
她就走进我这一家
...she walks into mine.

551
00:38:02,694 --> 00:38:05,562
你在弹什么?  只是我随便乱弹的
- What's that you're playing? - A little something of my own.

552
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:08,595
停  你知道我想听什么 不  我不知道
- Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear. - No, I don't.

553
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,727
你能为她弹  你也能为我弹
You played it for her. You can play it for me.

554
00:38:10,935 --> 00:38:14,205
我想我记不起来 如果她受得了  我也可以
- I don't think I can remember... - lf she can stand it, I can.

555
00:38:14,305 --> 00:38:15,294
弹!
Play it.

556
00:38:16,441 --> 00:38:17,806
是的  老板
Yes, boss.

557
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,167
你到底是什么人?  你以前是什么?
Who are you really? And what were you before?

558
00:39:49,267 --> 00:39:53,104
你是做什么的?  你又想些什么?
What did you do, and what did you think?

559
00:39:53,204 --> 00:39:55,138
我们说过不准问问题
We said no questions.

560
00:39:59,811 --> 00:40:01,802
永志不忘
Here's looking at you, kid.

561
00:40:35,813 --> 00:40:37,542
一法O买你的心事
A franc for your thoughts.

562
00:40:37,749 --> 00:40:40,149
在美国他们只出一分钱
In America they'd bring only a penny.

563
00:40:40,618 --> 00:40:42,552
我猜大概只值这么多
I guess that's about all they're won'th.

564
00:40:42,854 --> 00:40:48,092
我愿意被超额收费 告诉我
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.

565
00:40:48,192 --> 00:40:49,819
我在想...
Well, I was wondering...

566
00:40:50,561 --> 00:40:53,490
为什么我那么幸运?
Why I'm so lucky.

567
00:40:53,561 --> 00:40:56,890
为什么你会在那里等着我出现  正巧又被我找到
Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.

568
00:40:57,135 --> 00:40:59,330
为什么我的生命中 没有别的男人?
Why there is no other man in my life?

569
00:41:01,673 --> 00:41:03,903
那很简单  以前有
That's easy. There was.

570
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,400
他死了
He's dead.

571
00:41:08,346 --> 00:41:10,246
对不起我问了
I'm sorry for asking.

572
00:41:10,915 --> 00:41:13,315
我忘了我们说过不准问问题
I forgot we said no questions.

573
00:41:17,055 --> 00:41:20,821
只有一个答案 能解答我们所有的问题
Only one answer can take care of all our questions.

574
00:41:23,895 --> 00:41:27,023
“巴黎”

575
00:41:54,192 --> 00:41:57,389
这里是德国人史特格

576
00:41:57,495 --> 00:41:59,326
法国人，巴黎人

577
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:02,957
法国军队已放弃他们的岗位

578
00:42:03,067 --> 00:42:05,436
德国人已要求进入首都

579
00:42:05,536 --> 00:42:07,529
现在什么也阻止不了他们了
Nothing can stop them now.

580
00:42:07,536 --> 00:42:09,529
星期三  最迟星期四 他们便会来巴黎
Wednesday, Thursday at the latest, they'll be in Paris.

581
00:42:09,741 --> 00:42:12,676
理查  如果他们发现你的过去 你留在这里便不安全了
Richard, they'll find out your record. You won't be safe here.

582
00:42:12,844 --> 00:42:16,942
我早已在他们的黑名单上了 荣誉栏上
I'm on their blacklist already. Their roll of honor.

583
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:03,394
亨利要我们喝完这一瓶
Henri wants us to finish this bottle and then three more.

584
00:43:03,494 --> 00:43:08,431
还有三瓶他要用来浇花 也不让德国人喝
Says he'll water his garden with champagne before he'll let the Germans drink it.

585
00:43:08,633 --> 00:43:12,028
这可以减轻被占领的苦恼 你说是不是?  理查先生
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it?

586
00:43:12,103 --> 00:43:13,331
你说对了
You said it.

587
00:43:13,538 --> 00:43:15,472
永志不忘
Here's looking at you, kid.

588
00:43:22,914 --> 00:43:29,046
(德语)

589
00:43:42,733 --> 00:43:44,724
我的德语有点生锈了
My Germars a little rusty.

590
00:43:46,037 --> 00:43:47,595
是秘密警察
It's the Gestapo.

591
00:43:49,574 --> 00:43:52,372
他们说预计明天到巴黎
They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.

592
00:43:53,578 --> 00:43:57,014
他们在教我们当他们进来时 该如何反应
They're telling us how to act when they come marching in.

593
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:03,287
整个世界快倒下来了 我们却挑上这时候来谈恋爱
With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.

594
00:44:03,521 --> 00:44:05,148
对  真不巧
It's pretty bad timing.

595
00:44:05,456 --> 00:44:09,283
在十年前的话  你会说什么?  十年前?
- Where were you, say, 10 years ago? - 10 years ago?

596
00:44:10,728 --> 00:44:12,161
我想想看
Let's see.

597
00:44:12,396 --> 00:44:16,897
我还带着牙套 那时候你在那儿?
Yes, I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?

598
00:44:16,934 --> 00:44:18,424
正在找工作
Looking for a job.

599
00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:26,633
那是炮火吗?
Was that cannon fire?

600
00:44:27,678 --> 00:44:29,077
还是我的心在跳?
Or is it my heart pounding?

601
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,946
那是新的德国77型 单以声音来判断 大约只有35哩远
It's the new German 77th, and judging by the sound, only about 35 miles away.

602
00:44:35,653 --> 00:44:37,814
越来越近了
And getting closer every minute.

603
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:40,116
来  来  喝光
Here, here, drink up.

604
00:44:40,958 --> 00:44:42,687
另外那三瓶我们喝不完了
We'll never finish the other three.

605
00:44:42,894 --> 00:44:46,387
德国人很快就会到了 他们会来找你
Them Germans will be here pretty soon, and they'll come looking for you.

606
00:44:46,497 --> 00:44:48,624
别忘了拿下你有悬赏
And don't forget, there's a price on your head.

607
00:44:48,799 --> 00:44:51,791
我在公寓留有字条 他们知道到那里能找到我
Ileft a note in my apartment. They'll know where to find me.

608
00:44:52,303 --> 00:44:53,634
奇怪
It's strange.

609
00:44:54,372 --> 00:44:56,407
我对你了解得那么少  我对你的了解更少
- I know so very little about you. - I know very little about you.

610
00:44:58,409 --> 00:45:00,775
只知道你矫正过牙齿
Just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.

611
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,946
认真点  亲爱的  你有危险 你一定要离开巴黎
Be serious, darling. You are in danger. You must leave Paris.

612
00:45:05,149 --> 00:45:06,275
不  不  我们一定要离开
No, we must leave.

613
00:45:07,218 --> 00:45:08,685
对  当然是我们
Yes, of course. We.

614
00:45:08,886 --> 00:45:12,617
往马赛的火车五点开出 我四点半到你的饭店接你
The train for Marseilles leaves at 5:00. I'll pick you up at your hotel at 4:30.

615
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:16,251
不  不要在我饭店  我...
Not at my hotel. I...

616
00:45:16,394 --> 00:45:20,097
在我离开前我在城里有事要办
I have things to do in the city before I leave.

617
00:45:20,197 --> 00:45:21,824
我会在火车站跟你碰面
I'll meet you at the station.

618
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:24,226
好吧  四点四十五分
All right, at a quarter to 5.

619
00:45:24,468 --> 00:45:26,299
我们何不在马赛结婚
Why don't we get married in Marseilles?

620
00:45:30,107 --> 00:45:32,803
现在计划不嫌太遥远吗?
That's too far ahead to plan.

621
00:45:32,843 --> 00:45:34,640
对  我猜是远了点
Yes. I guess it is too far ahead.

622
00:45:35,947 --> 00:45:37,183
那火车上的列车长如何
Let's see... What about the engineer?

623
00:45:37,187 --> 00:45:39,183
他可以在火车上替我们主持婚礼
Why can't he marry us on the train?

624
00:45:39,283 --> 00:45:44,447
亲爱的 为什么不?  船上的船长可以 似乎有点不公平
Why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that...

625
00:45:44,555 --> 00:45:47,524
怎么了?  孩子
Hey, what's wrong, kid?

626
00:45:53,664 --> 00:45:55,359
我那么爱你
Llove you so much.

627
00:45:58,035 --> 00:46:00,503
而我那么痛恨这战争
And I hate this war so much.

628
00:46:02,473 --> 00:46:05,203
这是个疯狂的世界 任何事都可能发生
It's a crazy world. Anything can happen.

629
00:46:06,844 --> 00:46:08,812
万一如果你不能离开
If you shouldn't get away...

630
00:46:09,046 --> 00:46:13,718
我是说  万一我们被分开
If something should keep us apart...

631
00:46:13,818 --> 00:46:15,718
不管他们把你安置在那里
...wherever they put you...

632
00:46:15,886 --> 00:46:19,151
不管我会在那里 我要你知道我...
...and wherever I' II be, I want you to know that I...

633
00:46:24,729 --> 00:46:25,991
吻我
Kiss me.

634
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:29,331
有如最后一次般吻我
Kiss me as if it were the last time.

635
00:46:34,238 --> 00:46:37,207
上车!  上车!

636
00:46:37,341 --> 00:46:46,272
注意!  上车!

637
00:46:54,492 --> 00:47:03,332
所有乘客上车 最后一班火车在三分钟后开出

638
00:47:03,434 --> 00:47:05,236
快点，上车!  最后一班火车!

639
00:47:05,336 --> 00:47:06,803
她在那里?  你有看到她吗?
Where is she? Have you seen her?

640
00:47:06,971 --> 00:47:09,703
不  理查先生  我找不到她 她已经退了房间
I can't find her. She checked out of the hotel.

641
00:47:09,707 --> 00:47:11,766
不过你刚离开后送来这字条
But this note came just after you left.

642
00:47:14,812 --> 00:47:16,609
“亲爱的理查”

643
00:47:16,714 --> 00:47:18,341
“我不能跟你走或是再见你”

644
00:47:18,449 --> 00:47:19,780
“你不要问为什么”

645
00:47:19,884 --> 00:47:21,374
“只要相信我爱你”

646
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:23,009
“给我的爱人愿上帝祝福你”

647
00:47:23,154 --> 00:47:25,349
“伊莎”

648
00:47:26,924 --> 00:47:28,619
那是最后的召唤  理查先生
That's the last call, Mr. Richard.

649
00:47:29,393 --> 00:47:30,860
你听到我说吗?
Do you hear me?

650
00:47:31,595 --> 00:47:35,098
快点  我们离开这里再说 快点  理查先生  快点
Come on, Mr. Richard. Let's get out of here. Come on.

651
00:48:26,217 --> 00:48:27,980
瑞克  我必须跟你谈一下
Rick, I have to talk to you.

652
00:48:29,386 --> 00:48:33,290
我把第一杯留下来跟你一起喝 在这儿
I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.

653
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:36,989
不  不  瑞克  今晚不行 特别是今晚
- No, Rick. Not tonight. - Especially tonight.

654
00:48:37,461 --> 00:48:40,953
为什么你一定要来卡萨布兰卡 还有很多别的地方
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.

655
00:48:41,198 --> 00:48:43,564
如果我知道你在这里 我就不会来
I wouldn't have come if I' d known you were here.

656
00:48:44,301 --> 00:48:46,269
相信我  那是真的 我并不知道
Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.

657
00:48:46,437 --> 00:48:50,003
奇怪的是你的声音 一点都没变 我仍然听得到
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it.

658
00:48:50,007 --> 00:48:52,100
亲爱的理查 我会随你到天涯海角
"Richard, dear, I'll go with you anyplace.

659
00:48:52,576 --> 00:48:56,746
我们一起坐上火车 一路不停 别这样  瑞克
- We'll get on a train and never stop." - Don't, Rick.

660
00:48:56,847 --> 00:48:58,644
我明白你的感受
I can understand how you feel.

661
00:48:59,517 --> 00:49:01,644
你明白我的感受
You understand how I feel.

662
00:49:02,386 --> 00:49:04,115
我们相叙的日子有多长?  亲爱的
How long was it we had, honey?

663
00:49:05,089 --> 00:49:07,250
我没有数 我有
- I didn't count the days. - Well, I did.

664
00:49:07,591 --> 00:49:08,990
每一天都有
Every one of them.

665
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,560
最后一天我记得最清楚
Mostly I remember the last one.

666
00:49:12,596 --> 00:49:16,327
当汽笛声响过后 月台上有一个人站在雨中
The wild finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain...

667
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,229
脸上挂着可笑的表情
...with a comical look on his face...

668
00:49:18,402 --> 00:49:20,370
因为他的内心被踢翻了
...because his insides have been kicked out.

669
00:49:22,439 --> 00:49:24,566
瑞克 我可否说一个故事给你听?
Can I tell you a story, Rick?

670
00:49:24,742 --> 00:49:27,233
结局也有汽笛声吗?
Does it got a wild finish?

671
00:49:27,444 --> 00:49:29,571
我还不知道结局
I don't know the finish yet.

672
00:49:29,747 --> 00:49:33,183
那就说出来 或许一边说可以一边想
Go on, tell it. Maybe one'll come to you as you go along.

673
00:49:35,653 --> 00:49:39,419
是有关一位女孩 她刚从科斯鲁来到巴黎
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo.

674
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:41,319
在一个朋友的家里
At the house of some friends...

675
00:49:41,492 --> 00:49:44,359
她遇到她听闻了一辈子的男人
...she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life.

676
00:49:44,528 --> 00:49:47,725
一个伟大又勇敢的男人
A very great and courageous man.

677
00:49:48,098 --> 00:49:50,396
他为她揭开一个由知识
He opened up for her a whole beautiful world...

678
00:49:50,568 --> 00:49:53,162
思想和理想组成的美丽世界
...full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals.

679
00:49:53,571 --> 00:49:57,439
她知道的一切  她的成长 都是由于他的关系
Everything she knew or ever became was because of him.

680
00:49:57,608 --> 00:49:59,371
她景仰他
And she looked up to him...

681
00:49:59,643 --> 00:50:01,110
崇拜他
...and worshiped him...

682
00:50:01,312 --> 00:50:04,110
她假定那就是爱的感觉
...with a feeling she supposed was love.

683
00:50:04,281 --> 00:50:06,408
对  很美
Yes, that's very pretty.

684
00:50:06,584 --> 00:50:10,354
我也听过一个故事 事实上在我的年代也听过很多故事
I heard a story once. In fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time.

685
00:50:10,454 --> 00:50:13,252
都由细小的钢琴叮叮声伴奏
They went along with the sound of a tinny piano...

686
00:50:13,424 --> 00:50:16,127
就在楼下的大厅弹奏
...playing in the parlor downstairs.

687
00:50:16,227 --> 00:50:21,221
先生  我小时候有一次 遇上一个男人  开始总是这样
"Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid," they'd always begin.

688
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:27,333
我猜我们的故事都不怎么有趣
I guess neither one of our stories is very funny.

689
00:50:27,504 --> 00:50:28,562
告诉我
Tell me...

690
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:31,599
你是为了谁离开我?
...who was it you left me for?

691
00:50:31,809 --> 00:50:34,642
是拉斯路 还是中间还有别的人
Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between...

692
00:50:35,379 --> 00:50:37,711
或者你是不会说出来的人
...or aren't you the kind that tells?

693
00:51:00,137 --> 00:51:02,435
(雷诺队长，警察首长)

694
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,567
我极端怀疑尤佳迪先生 把过境信函留下给宾勒先生了
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine.

695
00:51:06,777 --> 00:51:09,143
我建议立刻彻底搜查咖啡馆
I would suggest you search the cafe immediately.

696
00:51:09,313 --> 00:51:12,516
如果信函在瑞克手上 他那么聪明你不可能找到的
If Rick has the letters, he's too smart to let you find them there.

697
00:51:12,616 --> 00:51:14,607
你太夸奖他的聪明
You give him credit for too much cleverness.

698
00:51:14,818 --> 00:51:17,412
我的印象他不过是另一个 莽撞的美国人
My impression was he's just another blundering American.

699
00:51:17,588 --> 00:51:19,613
你不要低估美国人的莽撞
We mustrt underestimate American blundering.

700
00:51:19,823 --> 00:51:23,759
1918年 当他们莽撞进入柏林时
I was with them when they blundered into Berlin in 1918.

701
00:51:23,927 --> 00:51:26,963
我跟他们在一起呢 至于拉斯路 我要派人24小时监视
As to Laszlo, we want him watched 24 hours a day.

702
00:51:26,997 --> 00:51:30,831
你可能会感兴趣想知道 此刻他正在来这里的途中
It may interest you to know that at this very moment he's on his way here.

703
00:51:35,906 --> 00:51:38,534
我们没办法
There is nothing we can do.

704
00:51:39,543 --> 00:51:41,212
很高兴看到你们  你们有充分休息吗 ?
I'm delighted to see you. Did you have a good night's rest?

705
00:51:41,312 --> 00:51:43,380
我睡得很好
I slept very well.

706
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:46,140
奇怪  在卡萨布兰卡 不应该有人会睡得好的
Strange. Nobody's supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.

707
00:51:47,451 --> 00:51:51,319
我们可否进行正事?  非常乐意  请坐下 谢谢
- May we proceed with the business? - With pleasure. Wort you sit down?

708
00:51:53,524 --> 00:51:56,982
好吧  我们坦白说好了 你是第三帝国的逃犯
Laszlo, we will not mince words. You're an escaped prisoner of the Reich.

709
00:51:57,061 --> 00:51:59,393
到目前为止你成功躲过我们
So far you have been fortunate in eluding us.

710
00:51:59,863 --> 00:52:01,353
你抵达了卡萨布兰卡
You have reached Casablanca.

711
00:52:01,632 --> 00:52:04,328
我有责任确保 你留在卡萨布兰卡
It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.

712
00:52:04,568 --> 00:52:06,627
你是否会成功当然仍是问题 一点也没
Whether or not you will succeed is problematic.

713
00:52:06,837 --> 00:52:09,770
每张出境许可 都需雷诺队长签名
Not at all. Renault 's signature is necessary on every visa.

714
00:52:09,773 --> 00:52:12,469
队长  你认为拉斯路 可能获得出境证吗
Captain, is it possible that Laszlo will receive a visa?

715
00:52:12,643 --> 00:52:14,975
我恐怕不会 我表示抱歉  先生
I'm afraid not. My regrets, monsieur.

716
00:52:15,212 --> 00:52:17,203
或许我会喜欢留在卡萨布兰卡
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.

717
00:52:17,848 --> 00:52:19,543
那小姐呢?
And mademoiselle?

718
00:52:19,717 --> 00:52:23,317
你不必为我操心  你们想告诉我们的就是这些
- You needrt be concerned about me. - Is that all you wish to tell us?

719
00:52:23,454 --> 00:52:26,355
别急  你的时间多的是
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world.

720
00:52:26,523 --> 00:52:29,185
你可能无限期留在卡萨布兰卡
You may be in Casablanca indefinitely.

721
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,294
或许你可能明天前往里斯本
Or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow.

722
00:52:31,462 --> 00:52:33,657
在一个条件之下 是什么?
- On one condition. - And that is?

723
00:52:33,931 --> 00:52:37,128
你知道各地地下组织首领是谁 在巴黎  布拉格
You know the leader of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague...

724
00:52:37,334 --> 00:52:37,935
布鲁赛尔  阿姆斯特丹
...Brussels, Amsterdam...

725
00:52:38,035 --> 00:52:41,266
奥斯陆 贝尔格勒  雅典
...Oslo, Belgrade, Athens...

726
00:52:41,338 --> 00:52:43,863
甚至在柏林 对  甚至在柏林
- Even Berlin. - Yes, even in Berlin.

727
00:52:44,074 --> 00:52:46,702
如果你提供我他们的名字 和确实的行踪
If you will furnish me with their names and whereabouts...

728
00:52:46,877 --> 00:52:48,640
你便可以在早上得到出境签证
...you'll have your visa in the morning.

729
00:52:48,912 --> 00:52:51,574
并且分享 为第三帝国服务的荣誉
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.

730
00:52:52,282 --> 00:52:54,477
我在德国集中营待过一年
I was in a German concentration camp for a year.

731
00:52:54,985 --> 00:52:59,148
那份荣誉够享用一辈子了 你会给我们那些名字吗?
- That's honor enough for a lifetime. - You will give us the names?

732
00:52:59,957 --> 00:53:02,448
如果在集中营时我没有给你们
If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp...

733
00:53:02,693 --> 00:53:05,594
在那儿 你能随意用更有说服力的方法
...where you had more persuasive methods at your disposal...

734
00:53:05,796 --> 00:53:08,356
现在我当然不会给你了
...I certainly won't give them to you now.

735
00:53:08,866 --> 00:53:11,232
如果你查获这些杀了他们呢?
And what if you track down these men and kill them?

736
00:53:11,435 --> 00:53:12,925
如果你谋杀我们全部又怎样?
What if you murdered all of us?

737
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:17,573
在欧洲的每个角落 有上千人会崛起 取代我们的位置
From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands would rise to take our places.

738
00:53:17,674 --> 00:53:20,006
即使纳粹党也不能杀得完
Even Nazis can't kill that fast.

739
00:53:20,177 --> 00:53:23,113
拉斯路  你以能言善辩著称
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand.

740
00:53:23,213 --> 00:53:25,549
我现在体会到 不过有点你说错
But in one aspect you are mistaken.

741
00:53:25,649 --> 00:53:28,174
你说第三帝国所有的敌人都可以取代
You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced.

742
00:53:28,385 --> 00:53:29,875
不过有一个例外
But there is one exception.

743
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,714
没有人能取代你的位置
No one could take your place ...

744
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:35,791
或防止在你逃走时发生的不幸
if anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.

745
00:53:36,193 --> 00:53:38,491
你不敢在这里阻挡我
You won't dare to interfere with me here.

746
00:53:38,662 --> 00:53:40,186
这里仍然是未被占领的法国
This is still unoccupied France.

747
00:53:40,697 --> 00:53:43,530
任何违法的举动 都会影响雷诺队长的声誉
Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault.

748
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:46,470
目前为止仍然在我控制之下 谢谢 对了  先生
- Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power. - Thank you.

749
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:50,869
昨晚你表示 对尤佳迪先生感兴趣
By the way, monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.

750
00:53:52,309 --> 00:53:55,176
我相信你有口信传给他
I believe you have a message for him?

751
00:53:55,345 --> 00:53:57,609
没有什么重要的事 不过我现在可以跟他谈话吗?
Nothing important. But may I speak to him now?

752
00:53:58,148 --> 00:54:01,140
你会发现谈话是单向的
You would find the conversation a trifle one-sided.

753
00:54:01,351 --> 00:54:03,216
尤佳迪先生死了
Signor Ugarte is dead.

754
00:54:09,827 --> 00:54:11,317
我正在写报告
I'm making out the report now.

755
00:54:11,495 --> 00:54:13,597
我们还没决定他到底是自杀
We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide...

756
00:54:13,697 --> 00:54:16,996
或者企图逃走时死去
...or died trying to escape.

757
00:54:18,268 --> 00:54:20,964
你们问完我们了吗?  暂时是的
- Are you quite finished with us? - For the time being.

758
00:54:21,171 --> 00:54:22,661
日安
Good day.

759
00:54:27,077 --> 00:54:29,705
毫无疑问他们下一步是找黑市
Undoubtedly, their next step will be to the black market.

760
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:30,904
对不起  队长
Excuse me, captain.

761
00:54:31,114 --> 00:54:34,106
出现了另一件签证问题
Another visa problem has come up.

762
00:54:34,585 --> 00:54:37,486
带她进来 是的
- Show her in. - Yes, sir.

763
00:54:46,163 --> 00:54:49,189
对不起  先生 我们应付不了警察
Sorry, monsieur, we were never to handle the police.

764
00:54:49,366 --> 00:54:51,368
这件事找法拉利先生才对  法拉利
- This is a job for Signor Ferrari. - Ferrari?

765
00:54:51,468 --> 00:54:54,571
认识法拉利会很有帮助
It can be most helpful to know Signor Ferrari.

766
00:54:54,671 --> 00:54:57,299
他独占了这里的黑市买卖
He pretty near has a monopoly on the black market here.

767
00:54:57,508 --> 00:54:59,567
你在那边的蓝鹦鹉可以找到他
You will find him at the Blue Parrot.

768
00:55:00,277 --> 00:55:01,904
谢谢
Thanks.

769
00:55:13,757 --> 00:55:15,156
不要太灰心
Don't be too downearted.

770
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:17,418
或许你可以与雷诺队长 取得协议
Perhaps you can come to terms with Renault.

771
00:55:17,594 --> 00:55:18,925
谢谢  先生 哈罗  法拉利
Thank you very much, signor.

772
00:55:19,096 --> 00:55:21,598
早  瑞克
- Hello, Ferrari. - Good morning, Rick.

773
00:55:21,698 --> 00:55:23,967
我看到巴士到了 我把我买的货一起带走
The bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.

774
00:55:24,067 --> 00:55:25,436
别急  我会叫人送去
I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.

775
00:55:25,536 --> 00:55:27,538
跟我喝一杯吧 早上我不喝酒的
I never drink in the morning.

776
00:55:27,539 --> 00:55:30,538
每次你送来给我的货 都短少了一点
And every time you send my shipment over it's a little short.

777
00:55:30,674 --> 00:55:32,642
搬运费  我的孩子
Carrying charges, my boy. Carrying charges.

778
00:55:32,809 --> 00:55:34,106
来  坐下
Here, sit down.

779
00:55:34,311 --> 00:55:36,939
反正我有些事情跟你谈
There is something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.

780
00:55:37,114 --> 00:55:38,741
"波旁" 威士忌
Bourbon.

781
00:55:39,016 --> 00:55:40,950
尤佳迪的新闻使我很不舒服
The news about Ugarte upsets me very much.

782
00:55:41,118 --> 00:55:44,621
你是个肥肿的虚伪者 尤佳迪的死你不会比我难过多少
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.

783
00:55:44,721 --> 00:55:47,519
当然不 我难过的是尤佳迪死了
Of course not. What upsets me is that Ugarte is dead...

784
00:55:47,691 --> 00:55:49,716
没有人知道那过境信在那里
...and no one knows where those letters are.

785
00:55:49,893 --> 00:55:51,190
几乎没有人
Practically no one.

786
00:55:51,395 --> 00:55:53,659
如果我得到 肯定可以赚一大笔
If I had those letters, I could make a fortune.

787
00:55:53,931 --> 00:55:55,990
我也可以 我是个贫穷的生意人
So could I, and I' m a poor businessman.

788
00:55:56,199 --> 00:55:57,435
不管在谁手上我给他一个建议
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters.

789
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,435
我来安排交易
I'll handle the entire transaction.

790
00:55:58,535 --> 00:56:02,139
承担一切风险把信卖出
Get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.

791
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:04,901
抽少部分利润 以及搬运费?
And the carrying charges?

792
00:56:04,942 --> 00:56:07,706
自然会有一些意外支出
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses.

793
00:56:08,412 --> 00:56:10,812
这是我对持有信函的人提议
That's my proposition for whoever has those letters.

794
00:56:10,981 --> 00:56:12,539
他出现时我会告诉他
I'll tell him when he comes in.

795
00:56:12,716 --> 00:56:15,607
我开门见山跟你说 我认为你知道那些信在那里
Rick, I think you know where those letters are.

796
00:56:15,619 --> 00:56:18,816
你有伴了 雷诺和史查沙大概也这样想
You're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so too.

797
00:56:24,528 --> 00:56:27,554
所以我才到这里 给他们机会搜索我的店
That's why I came here. To give them a chance to ransack my place.

798
00:56:27,731 --> 00:56:31,064
别傻了  跟我说实话 你需要一个合伙人
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.

799
00:56:31,234 --> 00:56:33,168
失陪  我要回去了
Excuse me, I' II be getting back.

800
00:56:36,773 --> 00:56:40,504
早 法拉利先生是那边桌子的肥仔
- Morning. - Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.

801
00:56:45,182 --> 00:56:47,810
在全摩洛哥 你也找不到这么珍贵的东西
You will not find a treasure like this in all Morocco.

802
00:56:48,018 --> 00:56:49,315
小姐  只要七百法O
Only 700 francs.

803
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:52,682
你被骗了 没关系  谢谢
- You're being cheated. - Doesrt matter, thank you.

804
00:56:52,856 --> 00:56:55,984
女士是瑞克的朋友 瑞克的朋友我们给一点折扣
For friends of Rick's we have a small discount.

805
00:56:56,193 --> 00:56:58,718
我刚才说七百法O吗?  两百法O卖给你
Did I say 700 francs? You can have it for 200.

806
00:56:58,895 --> 00:57:02,558
对不起  昨晚你来拜访时 我正处于不适合待客的状态
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.

807
00:57:02,733 --> 00:57:03,722
没关系 瑞克的特别朋友
Doesrt matter.

808
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:07,933
我们有特别的折扣  一百法O
For special friends of Rick's we have a special discount. 100 francs.

809
00:57:08,005 --> 00:57:11,141
那故事把我弄糊涂了 或者是喝多了"波旁" 吧
Your story had me a little confused. Or maybe it was the bourbon.

810
00:57:11,241 --> 00:57:12,833
我有些桌巾  一些餐巾
I have some tablecloths, napkins...

811
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:14,311
谢谢  我真的不感兴趣  请等一会儿
- Thank you. I' m really not interested. - Please, one minute.

812
00:57:14,411 --> 00:57:16,583
为什么你要回来呢?
Why did you come back?

813
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:20,707
为了告诉我你为何叫我在火车站白等  -对
To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station? -Yes.

814
00:57:20,884 --> 00:57:23,387
你现在可以告诉我 我比较清醒了
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.

815
00:57:23,487 --> 00:57:25,011
我想我不会说了  瑞克
I don't think I will, Rick.

816
00:57:25,188 --> 00:57:27,658
为何不 我买了火车票进退两难
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket.

817
00:57:27,668 --> 00:57:29,658
我想我有权利知道
I think I' m entitled to know.

818
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:31,855
昨晚我看到在你身上 发生了什么
Last night I saw what has happened to you.

819
00:57:32,529 --> 00:57:35,760
在巴黎的瑞克  我可以告诉他 他能够明白
The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him, he'd understand.

820
00:57:35,932 --> 00:57:38,492
可是用那种怨恨眼光看我的人
But the one who looked at me with such hatred...

821
00:57:40,037 --> 00:57:43,063
我很快会离开卡萨兰加 我们永远不会再见面了
I'll be leaving Casablanca soon. We'll never see each other again.

822
00:57:44,207 --> 00:57:48,268
我们在巴黎相爱的时候 我们彼此了解并不多
We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris.

823
00:57:48,445 --> 00:57:50,617
如果我们维持那样
If we leave it that way,

824
00:57:50,625 --> 00:57:53,617
或许我们会记住那些日子 而不是卡萨布兰卡
maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca.

825
00:57:53,717 --> 00:57:54,843
不是昨晚
Not last night.

826
00:57:55,519 --> 00:57:57,721
你舍我而去  因为你知道将会是什么样子
Did you run out on me because you knew what it would be like?

827
00:57:57,821 --> 00:58:01,892
逃避警察  无时无刻不在逃亡
Hiding from the police, running away all the time?

828
00:58:01,992 --> 00:58:03,687
如果你要相信是那样随便你
You can believe that if you want to.

829
00:58:03,894 --> 00:58:06,624
我已不再逃亡了 我安定下来了
Well, I' m not running away anymore. I'm settled now.

830
00:58:06,797 --> 00:58:08,031
虽然是酒馆  不过是事实
Above a saloon, it's true...

831
00:58:08,131 --> 00:58:10,300
要上飞机的话
...but walk up a flight...

832
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,129
我会算你一份
...I' II be expecting you.

833
00:58:14,204 --> 00:58:17,002
都一样 有一天你会对拉斯路撒谎
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo.

834
00:58:17,174 --> 00:58:18,903
你会去的
You'll be there.

835
00:58:20,444 --> 00:58:21,468
不  瑞克
No, Rick.

836
00:58:22,879 --> 00:58:25,143
不  维多拉斯路是我的丈夫
No. You see, Victor Laszlo is my husband.

837
00:58:26,183 --> 00:58:29,744
以前也是 甚至我在巴黎认识你之前也是
And was, even when I knew you in Paris.

838
00:58:34,324 --> 00:58:38,886
我刚才正跟拉斯路先生说  很不幸我无法帮助你们
I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo that unfortunately I' m not able to help him.

839
00:58:39,062 --> 00:58:40,962
是这样的  亲爱的 话已传开了
You see, my dear, word has gone around.

840
00:58:41,164 --> 00:58:43,900
身为卡萨布兰卡 所有非法活动的领导人
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca,

841
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,406
我是个有影响力和受尊重的人
I am influential and respected

842
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:49,406
替拉斯路先生做任何事 要冒生命危险并不值得
But it would not be won'th my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo.

843
00:58:49,506 --> 00:58:51,337
不过你  却是另一回事
You, however, are a different matter.

844
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:56,144
法拉利先生认为有可能 替你拿到一份签证
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you.

845
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:59,816
你是说让我单独离开 只能单独一人
- You mean for me to go on alone? - And only alone.

846
00:58:59,916 --> 00:59:03,311
我会留在这里继续想办法 我肯定再过一阵子...
I'll stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while...

847
00:59:03,353 --> 00:59:05,150
我还是坦白一点好  先生
Might as well be frank, monsieur.

848
00:59:05,322 --> 00:59:07,251
需要奇迹 你才可能离开卡萨布兰卡
It would take a miracle to get you out.

849
00:59:07,262 --> 00:59:09,251
德国人是剥夺奇迹的歹徒
The Germans have outlawed miracles.

850
00:59:09,259 --> 00:59:11,386
我们只对两位签证感兴趣 先生
We are only interested in two visas.

851
00:59:11,561 --> 00:59:14,125
拜托  伊莎  不要急躁 不  维多  不
- Please, llsa, don't be hasty. - No, Victor.

852
00:59:14,164 --> 00:59:16,257
你们两位会想讨论这件事
You two will want to discuss this.

853
00:59:16,433 --> 00:59:18,401
失陪  我会在酒吧
Excuse me. I' II be at the bar.

854
00:59:22,272 --> 00:59:24,069
不  伊莎 我不能让你留在这里
No, llsa. I won't let you stay here.

855
00:59:24,241 --> 00:59:27,735
你必须到美国去 我相信我终会逃出  跟你会合
You must get to America. Believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.

856
00:59:27,844 --> 00:59:29,641
维多  情况不一样
But if the situation were different...

857
00:59:29,813 --> 00:59:32,373
如果我必须留下 只有一份签证
...if I had to stay and there were only visa for one...

858
00:59:32,549 --> 00:59:33,846
你会要吗?
...would you take it?

859
00:59:35,051 --> 00:59:36,143
对  我会
Yes, I would.

860
00:59:37,354 --> 00:59:38,548
对  我明白
Yes, I see.

861
00:59:39,723 --> 00:59:41,625
当要离开"流尔"  我遇上麻烦时
When I had trouble getting out of Lille,

862
00:59:41,633 --> 00:59:43,625
你为什么不把我留在那儿?
why didn't you leave me there?

863
00:59:43,794 --> 00:59:45,931
当我在马赛生病时 耽搁你两个星期
When I was sick in Marseilles for two weeks...

864
00:59:45,934 --> 00:59:47,931
你无时无刻不冒着生命危险
...and you were in danger every minute...

865
00:59:48,031 --> 00:59:49,828
那时候你为什么不留下我?
...why didn't you leave me then?

866
00:59:51,134 --> 00:59:53,625
我本来要 总是有些东西阻止我
I meant to, but something always held me up.

867
00:59:56,106 --> 00:59:57,573
我非常爱你  伊莎
Ilove you very much, llsa.

868
00:59:58,775 --> 01:00:00,868
我会保守你的秘密
Your secret will be safe with me.

869
01:00:01,945 --> 01:00:04,038
法拉利在等我们的答案
Ferrari is waiting for our answer.

870
01:00:04,214 --> 01:00:06,546
不能超过五十法O
Not more than 50 francs.

871
01:00:11,288 --> 01:00:13,085
我们已经决定了  法拉利先生
We've decided, Signor Ferrari.

872
01:00:13,256 --> 01:00:16,623
从现在起我们只寻求两份签证 非常感谢你
For the present we will go on looking for two visas. Thank you very much.

873
01:00:16,793 --> 01:00:18,761
祝你好运  务必小心
Well, good luck, but be careful.

874
01:00:18,929 --> 01:00:21,762
你知道你被跟踪吗?  当然  已经习以为常
- You know you're being shadowed? - Of course. It becomes an instinct.

875
01:00:22,098 --> 01:00:25,124
我发现在某方面来说 你是个幸运的人  先生
I observe that you, in one respect, are a very fortunate man.

876
01:00:25,335 --> 01:00:28,031
我觉得想再给你一个建议 为了什么我也不知道
I am moved to make one more suggestion. Why, I do not know.

877
01:00:28,205 --> 01:00:30,105
因为你不可能给我好处
Because it cannot possibly profit me.

878
01:00:30,307 --> 01:00:33,470
你有听闻尤佳迪先生 和过境信吗?
Have you heard about Ugarte and the letters of transit?

879
01:00:33,643 --> 01:00:34,632
是  一点点
Yes, something.

880
01:00:34,811 --> 01:00:38,008
他们逮捕尤佳迪时 没有在他身上找到那些信
Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.

881
01:00:38,181 --> 01:00:39,182
你知道信在那里吗?
- You know where they are? - Not for sure.

882
01:00:39,282 --> 01:00:45,222
不过我猜尤佳迪 把信留给瑞克先生
But I'd guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.

883
01:00:45,322 --> 01:00:46,522
那瑞克有难以理解的习惯
A difficult customer, that Rick.

884
01:00:46,523 --> 01:00:48,522
没有人知道 他会做什么及为什么
One never knows what he'll do or why.

885
01:00:48,725 --> 01:00:50,352
不过值得试一试
But it is won'th a chance.

886
01:00:50,927 --> 01:00:53,725
非常感谢你  日安
Thank you very much. Good day.

887
01:00:53,964 --> 01:00:55,734
再见  谢谢你的咖啡  先生
Goodbye. Thank you for your coffee.

888
01:00:55,764 --> 01:00:57,734
我们离开卡萨布兰卡后 我将会怀念那咖啡
I shall miss that when we leave Casablanca.

889
01:00:57,834 --> 01:01:00,701
请你跟我分享 日安  小姐
Gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, mademoiselle.

890
01:01:00,871 --> 01:01:03,305
先生 日安
- Monsieur. - Good day.

891
01:01:12,716 --> 01:01:14,343
敬你  先生 祝好运
- Here's to you, sir. - Good luck.

892
01:01:14,851 --> 01:01:16,253
我要走了  请给我帐单
- I'd better be going. - My check, please.

893
01:01:16,353 --> 01:01:19,856
我必须警告你  这是个危险的地方  很多贪心的人
I have to warn you, sir. This is a dangerous place. Full of vultures.

894
01:01:19,956 --> 01:01:23,727
到处是贪心的人 谢谢 再见  先生
- Vultures everywhere. Thanks for everything. - Goodbye.

895
01:01:23,827 --> 01:01:25,454
很荣幸认识你
It has been a pleasure to meet you.

896
01:01:25,629 --> 01:01:27,290
对不起
I'm sorry.

897
01:01:43,146 --> 01:01:46,843
瑞克先生 你快成为自己最好的顾客了
Monsieur Rick, you are getting to be your best customer.

898
01:01:48,885 --> 01:01:51,251
在喝酒?  你使我很高兴
Well, drinking. I'm very pleased with you.

899
01:01:51,421 --> 01:01:53,321
你现在开始 像法国人那样生活了
You're beginning to live like a Frenchman.

900
01:01:53,523 --> 01:01:55,855
你的手下今天下午 来搅乱我的店
That was some going-over your men gave my place.

901
01:01:56,026 --> 01:01:58,017
我们差点来不及清理开门营业
We barely got cleaned up in time to open.

902
01:01:58,194 --> 01:02:00,458
我告诉过史查沙休不会在这里 找到那些信
I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here.

903
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:02,757
不过我告诉我的手下 要格外有破坏力  你知道
But I told my men to be especially destructive.

904
01:02:02,933 --> 01:02:04,867
那可叫德国人刮目相看
You know how that impresses Germans.

905
01:02:06,202 --> 01:02:08,500
瑞克  你有那些过境信吗?
Rick, have you got those letters of transit?

906
01:02:08,872 --> 01:02:10,965
你是倾向亲德还是自由法国?
Louis, are you Pro-Vichy or Free French?

907
01:02:11,608 --> 01:02:16,068
我活该  问这直接的问题 这话题结束
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.

908
01:02:16,579 --> 01:02:18,843
似乎你晚了一步
It looks like you're a little late.

909
01:02:26,156 --> 01:02:27,817
原来伊娃向敌人投诚了
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.

910
01:02:27,991 --> 01:02:31,757
谁知道  以她自己的方法 她可能组织第二条前线
Who knows? In her own way, she may constitute an entire second front.

911
01:02:32,162 --> 01:02:36,399
我想我该去 奉承一下史查沙少校 回头见!  瑞克
I think it's time for me to flatter Strasser a little. I' II see you later.

912
01:02:36,499 --> 01:02:37,932
沙克!
Sascha!

913
01:02:38,101 --> 01:02:39,125
法国七十五
French 75s.

914
01:02:39,336 --> 01:02:43,073
我们要一整排  沙克 从这里开始  到这里结束
Put up a whole row of them, Sascha. Starting here and ending here.

915
01:02:43,173 --> 01:02:44,504
我们从两杯开始
We will begin with two.

916
01:02:44,908 --> 01:02:47,968
你不是法国人吗？ (法语)

917
01:02:48,078 --> 01:02:51,946
竟然跟这种德国人约会 关你什么事

918
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:55,778
你说什么?  麻烦你再说一次
What did you say? Would you kindly repeat it?

919
01:02:55,986 --> 01:02:59,353
我说什么与你无关 我会使它变成跟我有关
- What I said is none of your business. - I' II make it my business.

920
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:04,692
停手!求求你，求求你停手

921
01:03:05,528 --> 01:03:09,191
我不喜欢人家在我的店乱来 不抛开政治就滚出去
I don't like disturbances in my place. Either lay off politics or get out.

922
01:03:10,567 --> 01:03:12,626
有一天，你会得到报应的

923
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:15,128
你看到了吧  队长
You see, captain?

924
01:03:15,372 --> 01:03:17,772
情况并不如你想像的那么稳定
The situation is not as under control as you believe.

925
01:03:17,974 --> 01:03:19,839
亲爱的少校 我们正尽量跟贵政府合作
We try to cooperate with your government.

926
01:03:20,043 --> 01:03:22,307
我们无法规定人民的感受
But we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.

927
01:03:22,479 --> 01:03:24,640
队长 你完全肯定你帮那一边吗
Captain, are you certain which side you're on?

928
01:03:24,948 --> 01:03:27,109
我没有信念 如果你指这一方面
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean.

929
01:03:27,317 --> 01:03:28,614
我看风转舵  目前的风向
I blow with the wind...

930
01:03:28,785 --> 01:03:31,320
正巧从维琪(亲德)吹来
...and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.

931
01:03:31,388 --> 01:03:33,083
如果风向改了呢?
And if it should change?

932
01:03:33,356 --> 01:03:35,517
我肯定 帝国不会承认那种可能性
Surely the Reich doesn't admit that possibility?

933
01:03:35,692 --> 01:03:37,785
我们关心的不只是卡萨布兰卡
We are concerned about more than Casablanca.

934
01:03:37,994 --> 01:03:40,163
我们知道 每个在非洲的法国管区
We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors.

935
01:03:40,263 --> 01:03:44,668
都布满了叛徒  正在等候机会 或许在等候一位领导人
Waiting for their chance. Waiting perhaps for a leader.

936
01:03:44,768 --> 01:03:46,326
领导人?  像拉斯路?
Aleader? Like Laszlo?

937
01:03:46,970 --> 01:03:48,301
我一直在想
I have been thinking.

938
01:03:48,638 --> 01:03:51,937
让他离开太危险 但让他留下也可能太危险
It's too dangerous to let him go, it may be too dangerous to let him stay.

939
01:03:52,108 --> 01:03:53,097
我明白你的意思
I see what you mean.

940
01:03:54,077 --> 01:03:58,915
(德语)

941
01:03:59,015 --> 01:04:00,880
谢谢  卡尔 你的  太太
Thank you, Carl.

942
01:04:01,084 --> 01:04:03,314
谢谢  卡尔
Thank you, Carl.

943
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,454
卡尔  坐下 跟我们喝杯白兰地
Sit down. Have a brandy with us.

944
01:04:05,789 --> 01:04:08,223
庆祝我们明天到美国去
To celebrate our leaving for America tomorrow.

945
01:04:08,391 --> 01:04:09,483
非常谢谢
Thank you very much.

946
01:04:09,692 --> 01:04:12,529
我早想到你会请我喝 所以我拿了上等的白兰地
I thought you would ask me, so I brought the good brandy...

947
01:04:12,629 --> 01:04:14,460
还有...高脚杯
...and a third glass.

948
01:04:14,631 --> 01:04:16,622
终于  这一天到来了
At last the day's came!

949
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:19,633
从现在起我们只说英文
Frau Leuchtag and I are speaking nothing but English now.

950
01:04:19,803 --> 01:04:22,670
这样我们到美国后 会感觉像回到家一样
So we should feel at home when we get to America.

951
01:04:22,839 --> 01:04:24,500
很不错的主意
A very nice idea.

952
01:04:24,841 --> 01:04:26,069
为美国喝一杯
To America.

953
01:04:26,843 --> 01:04:27,832
为美国喝一杯
To America.

954
01:04:33,116 --> 01:04:37,177
亲爱的  什么表(几点了)?
What watch?

955
01:04:37,687 --> 01:04:40,679
十个表(十点) 那么多(这么晚了)
- Ten watch. - Such much?

956
01:04:42,325 --> 01:04:44,657
你们会在美国过得非常愉快
You will get along beautifully in America.

957
01:04:45,662 --> 01:04:47,425
幸运女神有没有照顾你?
How is lady luck treating you?

958
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:49,461
真可惜
Oh, too bad.

959
01:04:49,799 --> 01:04:51,664
他就在那边
You'll find him over there.

960
01:04:57,907 --> 01:04:59,431
瑞克先生 是
- Monsieur Rick? - Yes?

961
01:04:59,609 --> 01:05:02,840
我可否跟你说几句话  你怎么进来的?  你还未成年
- Could I speak to you, please? - How'd you get in here? You're underage.

962
01:05:03,012 --> 01:05:05,474
我跟雷诺队长一起来的 我早该猜到
- I came with Captain Renault. - I should have known.

963
01:05:05,515 --> 01:05:06,846
我的丈夫也跟我一起
My husband is with me too.

964
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:09,152
是吗?  雷诺队长思想越来开明
He is? Captain Renault 's getting broad-minded. Sit down.

965
01:05:09,252 --> 01:05:11,021
坐下  要喝一杯吗?
Have a drink?

966
01:05:11,121 --> 01:05:13,817
当然不喝  你介意我喝吗?  不
No, of course not. You mind if I do?

967
01:05:14,424 --> 01:05:15,482
瑞克先生
Monsieur Rick...

968
01:05:16,192 --> 01:05:19,853
雷诺队长是怎样的人?  就像其他的男人  或者更像
...what kind of a man is Captain Renault? - Like any other man, only more so.

969
01:05:19,963 --> 01:05:20,952
我是说
No, I mean...

970
01:05:21,297 --> 01:05:22,958
他值得信任吗?  他的话...
...is he trustwon'thy? Is his word...?

971
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:27,363
等一下  谁叫你来问我的?  他叫我的  雷诺队长
- Just a minute. Who told you to ask me that? - He did. Captain Renault did.

972
01:05:27,437 --> 01:05:29,496
我也猜到  你的丈夫呢?
I thought so. Where's your husband?

973
01:05:29,772 --> 01:05:34,110
在轮盘桌那边 想要赢足够的钱 买我们的出境证
At the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visas.

974
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:36,007
当然他正在输钱
Oh, of course he's losing.

975
01:05:36,246 --> 01:05:39,147
你们结婚多久了?  八个星期
- How long have you been married? - Eight weeks.

976
01:05:40,183 --> 01:05:41,810
我们从保加利亚来
We come from Bulgaria.

977
01:05:42,418 --> 01:05:44,648
那里的情况非常坏  先生
Things are very bad there.

978
01:05:44,821 --> 01:05:47,016
魔鬼押着人民的脖子
The devil has the people by the throat.

979
01:05:47,423 --> 01:05:49,948
所以犹安和我  我们...
So Jan and I, we...

980
01:05:50,126 --> 01:05:52,822
我们不想子女在那种地方长大
We do not want our children to grow up in such a country.

981
01:05:53,029 --> 01:05:54,564
所以你们决定去美国
- So you decided to go to America. - Yes.

982
01:05:54,664 --> 01:05:58,034
对  可是我们钱不多
But we haven't much money...

983
01:05:58,134 --> 01:06:00,602
旅费那么贵而且困难
...and traveling is so expensive and difficult.

984
01:06:01,004 --> 01:06:03,029
来这里的花费 比我们预算高很多
It was much more than we thought to get here.

985
01:06:03,706 --> 01:06:05,571
然后雷诺队长看到我们
And then Captain Renault sees us...

986
01:06:05,775 --> 01:06:08,945
他很仁慈  他想帮我们 对  我打赌是
...and he is so kind, he wants to help us. - Yes, I' II bet.

987
01:06:09,045 --> 01:06:11,781
他告诉我 他可以给我们出境签证
He tells me he can give us an exit visa.

988
01:06:11,881 --> 01:06:14,117
可是  我们没有钱
But we have no money.

989
01:06:14,217 --> 01:06:15,809
他知道吗?  知道
- Does he know that? - Yes.

990
01:06:15,985 --> 01:06:17,754
那他仍然愿意给你签证
- And he's still willing to give you a visa? - Yes.

991
01:06:17,854 --> 01:06:21,948
对  先生 而你想知道... 他会不会遵守诺言?
- And you want to know...? - Will he keep his word?

992
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:23,651
他一直都有
He always has.

993
01:06:27,363 --> 01:06:30,934
先生  你是一个男人
You are a man.

994
01:06:31,034 --> 01:06:33,696
假设有一个人非常爱你
If someone loved you very much...

995
01:06:33,903 --> 01:06:38,135
她只求能给你快乐
...so that your happiness was the only thing that she wanted in the world...

996
01:06:38,708 --> 01:06:41,575
为了肯定能办到 她做了件坏事
...and she did a bad thing to make certain of it...

997
01:06:42,078 --> 01:06:45,178
你会不会原谅她?  没有人曾经那么爱我
...could you forgive her? - Nobody ever loved me that much.

998
01:06:45,348 --> 01:06:49,252
他一直都不知道 那女孩把做过的坏事藏在心里
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart...

999
01:06:49,352 --> 01:06:51,149
这样不会有关系吧  会不会?
...that would be all right, wouldn't it?

1000
01:06:51,321 --> 01:06:53,448
你要我提意见吗?  是  拜托
- You want my advice? - Yes, please.

1001
01:06:53,957 --> 01:06:55,049
回到保加利亚去
Go back to Bulgaria.

1002
01:06:55,291 --> 01:06:59,523
如果你知道能离开欧洲到美国 对我们有多重要
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America...

1003
01:07:00,763 --> 01:07:04,859
如果犹安发现了 他那么孩子气
Oh, but if Jan should find out. He is such a boy.

1004
01:07:05,034 --> 01:07:08,470
在很多方面  我比他成熟 对
In many ways I am so much older than he is.

1005
01:07:08,638 --> 01:07:11,163
在卡萨布兰卡每个人都有困难
Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems.

1006
01:07:11,241 --> 01:07:14,404
你的困难可能会解决的  失陪 谢谢  先生
- Yours may work out. You'll excuse me. - Thank you, monsieur.

1007
01:07:23,086 --> 01:07:24,383
晚安
- Good evening. - Good evening.

1008
01:07:24,554 --> 01:07:28,081
你看  我们又来了 我认为那是对山姆的恭维
- You see? Here we are again. - I take that as a great compliment to Sam.

1009
01:07:28,258 --> 01:07:31,961
我猜对你而言他代表巴黎 那些较快乐的日子
I suppose he means to you Paris of happier days.

1010
01:07:32,061 --> 01:07:35,224
的确是 我们可否选择靠近他的桌子
He does. Could we have a table close to him?

1011
01:07:35,431 --> 01:07:37,763
并且离史查沙少校越远越好
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.

1012
01:07:38,101 --> 01:07:40,592
这样的安排可能有点困难
The geography may be a little difficult to arrange.

1013
01:07:40,770 --> 01:07:42,533
保罗  三十号桌
- Paul, table 30. - Yes, sir.

1014
01:07:42,705 --> 01:07:44,502
是的  先生  请往这边
Right this way, if you please.

1015
01:07:44,674 --> 01:07:48,578
我叫山姆弹"时光飞逝"  我相信那是你偏爱的曲子
I'll have Sam play "As Time Goes By." I believe that's your favorite tune.

1016
01:07:48,678 --> 01:07:49,940
谢谢
Thank you.

1017
01:07:59,355 --> 01:08:01,983
两杯干邑(白兰地)麻烦你 干邑
- Two cognacs, please. - Cognac.

1018
01:08:07,730 --> 01:08:09,755
下注，先生女士

1019
01:08:09,866 --> 01:08:12,357
赌博游戏继续进行

1020
01:08:12,468 --> 01:08:14,459
先生女士，下注

1021
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:20,702
游戏继续，下注

1022
01:08:25,081 --> 01:08:27,641
你要不要再下注呢?  先生
Do you wish to place another bet, sir?

1023
01:08:28,184 --> 01:08:29,913
不  不  我想不要了
No. No, I guess not.

1024
01:08:30,086 --> 01:08:31,951
你今晚买过22号吗?
Have you tried 22 tonight?

1025
01:08:33,523 --> 01:08:34,922
我说22
I said 22.

1026
01:08:36,492 --> 01:08:41,930
下注，先生女士，游戏继续

1027
01:08:51,274 --> 01:08:52,605
留在那里
Leave it there.

1028
01:08:55,645 --> 01:09:03,711
下注，先生女士 游戏继续进行

1029
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:07,490
好了，不要下注 二十二

1030
01:09:07,590 --> 01:09:09,455
拿去兑现金  不要再回来
Cash it in and don't come back.

1031
01:09:12,228 --> 01:09:14,219
你肯定这地方诚实吗?
Are you sure this place is honest?

1032
01:09:14,797 --> 01:09:18,631
诚实?  日子有多长就有多诚实
Honest? As honest as the day is long.

1033
01:09:19,869 --> 01:09:21,471
不要再下注了

1034
01:09:21,571 --> 01:09:22,902
我们今天成绩如何?
How are we doing tonight?

1035
01:09:23,239 --> 01:09:25,901
比我预料的少了几千块
A couple of thousand less than I thought there would be.

1036
01:09:29,612 --> 01:09:31,580
瑞克先生...我...
Monsieur Rick...

1037
01:09:36,619 --> 01:09:38,246
他走运而已
He's just a lucky guy.

1038
01:09:40,957 --> 01:09:43,858
瑞克先生 我倒杯咖啡给你好吗
Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?

1039
01:09:44,026 --> 01:09:46,085
不  谢谢  卡尔 瑞克先生
- No, thanks, Carl. - Monsieur Rick...

1040
01:09:49,599 --> 01:09:51,089
雷诺队长  我可否...
Captain Renault, may l- -?

1041
01:09:51,267 --> 01:09:55,328
在这里不行 明早到我办公室 我们依照手续
Not here. Come to my office in the morning. We'll do everything businesslike.

1042
01:09:55,405 --> 01:09:56,639
我们会在六点到
- We'll be there at 6.

1043
01:09:56,739 --> 01:10:00,243
我会在十点到  我很替你们高兴
- I'll be there at 10. I'm very happy for both of you.

1044
01:10:00,343 --> 01:10:02,436
你赢钱有一点奇怪
Still, it's very strange that you won.

1045
01:10:02,612 --> 01:10:04,876
或许不是那么奇怪
Well, maybe not so strange.

1046
01:10:05,047 --> 01:10:07,880
明天早上见 非常谢谢  雷诺队长
- I'll see you in the morning. - Thank you, Captain Renault.

1047
01:10:08,284 --> 01:10:09,876
不  是真的吗?
No!

1048
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:18,492
老板  你做了一件天大的好事
Boss, you've done a beautiful thing.

1049
01:10:19,262 --> 01:10:21,696
走开  疯狂的俄国人
Go away, you crazy Russian.

1050
01:10:31,641 --> 01:10:35,504
正如我怀疑 你是不折不扣的感情用事者  为什么?
- As I suspected. You're a rank sentimentalist. - Yeah? Why?

1051
01:10:35,578 --> 01:10:37,773
为什么你干扰我小小的罗曼史
Why do you interfere with my little romances?

1052
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:39,811
就算是向爱情致敬吧
Put it down as a gesture to love.

1053
01:10:39,982 --> 01:10:41,506
这一次我原谅你
Well, I' II forgive you this time.

1054
01:10:41,717 --> 01:10:44,550
不过明天晚上我会带来  一位令窒息的金发美女
But I' II be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blond.

1055
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:46,915
如果她输钱会叫我非常高兴
And it'll make me very happy if she loses.

1056
01:10:50,993 --> 01:10:53,196
宾勒先生 不晓得可否跟你谈谈
- Mr. Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you. - Go ahead.

1057
01:10:53,296 --> 01:10:56,032
说吧 有别的说话地方吗?
Well, isn't there some other place?

1058
01:10:56,132 --> 01:10:58,623
我要说的是颇机密的事
It's rather confidential, what I have to say.

1059
01:11:00,603 --> 01:11:02,833
在我办公室 好的
- In my office. - Right.

1060
01:11:03,906 --> 01:11:06,568
你一定知道离开卡萨布兰卡 对我很重要
You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca.

1061
01:11:06,742 --> 01:11:09,734
身为这伟大运动的领导人之一 是一份莫大的荣幸
It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement.

1062
01:11:09,912 --> 01:11:11,675
你知道我一直从事什么
You know what I' ve been doing.

1063
01:11:11,848 --> 01:11:15,784
你知道那有多重要  对全世界 对千百万人的生命
You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands of people...

1064
01:11:15,952 --> 01:11:18,216
如果我能到美国继续我的工作
...that I reach America and continue my work.

1065
01:11:18,387 --> 01:11:19,820
我对政治不感兴趣
I'm not interested in politics.

1066
01:11:19,989 --> 01:11:22,480
世界的问题不是我分内的事
The problems of the world are not in my department.

1067
01:11:22,758 --> 01:11:23,850
我是开酒馆的
I'm a saloonkeeper.

1068
01:11:24,193 --> 01:11:27,796
我从事地下工作的朋友告诉我  你有不平凡的纪录
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record.

1069
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:29,454
你运枪械到衣索比亚
You ran guns to Ethiopia.

1070
01:11:29,632 --> 01:11:32,568
你在西班牙对抗法西斯 那又怎样?
- You fought against the fascists in Spain. - What of it?

1071
01:11:32,668 --> 01:11:35,831
你总是帮受迫害的那边打仗  不是有点奇怪吗?
Isn't it strange you're always fighting on the side of the underdog?

1072
01:11:36,038 --> 01:11:37,972
对 我并发现那是种昂贵的喜好
Yes, I found that a very expensive hobby.

1073
01:11:38,174 --> 01:11:40,404
不过我那时候不太会做生意
But then I never was much of a businessman.

1074
01:11:40,576 --> 01:11:43,943
现在你是否较会做生意 晓得...  十万法O这价码
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of 100,000 francs?

1075
01:11:44,113 --> 01:11:47,247
我欣赏  可是我不接受 我加到二十万
- I appreciate it, but I don't accept it. - 200,000.

1076
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:49,875
朋友 你可以加到一百万或三百万
My friend, you could make it a million francs or three.

1077
01:11:50,086 --> 01:11:51,883
我的答案仍然一样
My answer would still be the same.

1078
01:11:52,054 --> 01:11:54,215
一定有原因使你不愿意给我
There must be some reason why you won't let me.

1079
01:11:54,423 --> 01:11:55,549
是有
There is.

1080
01:11:56,025 --> 01:11:58,152
我建议你去问你的妻子
I suggest that you ask your wife.

1081
01:11:58,461 --> 01:12:01,089
你说什么?  我说问你的妻子
- I beg your pardon? - I said, ask your wife.

1082
01:12:01,464 --> 01:12:03,864
我的妻子 对
- My wife? - Yes.

1083
01:12:04,133 --> 01:12:09,594
(德国歌)

1084
01:12:44,273 --> 01:12:46,264
弹奏"马赛曲"  快
Play "La Marseillaise." Play it!

1085
01:13:46,535 --> 01:13:50,528
法国万岁，民主万岁

1086
01:14:02,318 --> 01:14:04,389
你明白我的意思了吧 如果在咖啡馆出现的拉斯路
See what I mean? If Laszlo 's presence in a cafe...

1087
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:06,389
可以鼓动这样不幸的示威行动
...can inspire this demonstration...

1088
01:14:06,489 --> 01:14:08,957
他在卡萨布兰卡 还会导致什么?
...what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on?

1089
01:14:09,125 --> 01:14:11,116
我奉劝把这地方马上查封
I advise that this place be shut up at once.

1090
01:14:11,394 --> 01:14:12,995
可是大家都那么开心
- But everybody's having a good time.

1091
01:14:13,095 --> 01:14:15,825
对  太开心了 这地方必须查封
- Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.

1092
01:14:15,898 --> 01:14:18,958
可是我没有藉口查封  找一个
- But I have no excuse to close it. - Find one.

1093
01:14:20,703 --> 01:14:22,295
祝健康!先生 健康

1094
01:14:23,873 --> 01:14:25,500
所有人必须马上离开
Everybody is to leave immediately.

1095
01:14:25,741 --> 01:14:27,971
这咖啡馆关闭 直到另行通知为止
This cafe is closed until further notice.

1096
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:29,802
马上清场
Clear the room at once.

1097
01:14:33,249 --> 01:14:34,614
你怎么可以查封我 有什么理由
How can you close me up?

1098
01:14:34,817 --> 01:14:38,275
我很震惊  发现这里进行赌博
I'm shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here.

1099
01:14:38,454 --> 01:14:39,388
你赢的钱  先生  很谢谢你
- Your winnings, sir. - Thank you.

1100
01:14:39,488 --> 01:14:42,116
所有人马上出去
Everybody out at once.

1101
01:14:46,228 --> 01:14:48,232
经过这次骚动后
After this disturbance...

1102
01:14:48,238 --> 01:14:50,232
拉斯路先生留在卡萨布兰卡已不再安全了
...it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.

1103
01:14:50,332 --> 01:14:53,130
今早你暗示他离开卡萨布兰卡  并不安全
This morning you implied it wasrt safe to leave Casablanca.

1104
01:14:53,302 --> 01:14:56,237
不错  除了一处目的地 回到被占领的法国
That is also true, except for one destination: Occupied France.

1105
01:14:56,439 --> 01:14:57,640
被占领的法国?
- Occupied France? - Under safe conduct from me.

1106
01:14:57,740 --> 01:15:00,643
在我的安全保证下 一文不值
Of what value is that?

1107
01:15:00,743 --> 01:15:03,769
你可能记得过去德国的信誉 值多少钱吧!
You may recall what German guarantees have been won'th in the past.

1108
01:15:03,946 --> 01:15:07,211
你只有两个选择 是什么?
- There are two other alternatives for him. - What are they?

1109
01:15:07,383 --> 01:15:09,683
有可能法国当局会找一个理由
The French authorities may find a reason...

1110
01:15:09,684 --> 01:15:11,683
把他送进这儿的集中营
...to put him in the concentration camp here.

1111
01:15:11,854 --> 01:15:12,946
另一个选择呢?
The other alternative?

1112
01:15:13,122 --> 01:15:15,889
亲爱的小姐  或许你已经察觉
My dear, perhaps you have already observed...

1113
01:15:15,892 --> 01:15:17,889
在卡萨布兰卡人命不值钱
...that in Casablanca human life is cheap.

1114
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:19,391
晚安  小姐
Good night, mademoiselle.

1115
01:15:30,106 --> 01:15:33,598
瑞克怎么回事?  我们待会儿再商量
- What happened with Rick? - We'll discuss it later.

1116
01:15:56,532 --> 01:15:58,523
我们忠心的朋友仍然在那里
Our faithful friend is still there.

1117
01:15:59,068 --> 01:16:01,593
维多 求你今晚不要去地下会议
Please don't go to the underground meeting tonight.

1118
01:16:01,837 --> 01:16:02,929
我一定要去
I must.

1119
01:16:03,105 --> 01:16:06,563
况且一个男人能在他妻子面前 扮演英雄的机会不多
Besides, it isn't often that a man gets to display heroics before his wife.

1120
01:16:06,742 --> 01:16:09,612
不要开玩笑 经过史查沙少校今晚的警告后
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I' m frightened.

1121
01:16:09,712 --> 01:16:12,180
我很害怕 告诉你事实  我也害怕
Tell you the truth, I'm frightened too.

1122
01:16:12,281 --> 01:16:14,715
我应该留在这里?  躲在饭店房间
Shall I remain here in a hotel room, hiding?

1123
01:16:14,917 --> 01:16:16,544
或者我应该继续尽力而为?
Or shall I carry on the best I can?

1124
01:16:16,952 --> 01:16:19,614
不管我说什么你也会继续做
Whatever I' d say, you would carry on.

1125
01:16:20,489 --> 01:16:23,492
维多 为何你不告诉我瑞克的事 你发现了什么?
Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?

1126
01:16:23,592 --> 01:16:25,361
很明显那些信在他手上
- Apparently he has the letters. - Yes?

1127
01:16:25,461 --> 01:16:27,827
还有呢?  可是没有要卖的意思
But no intention of selling them.

1128
01:16:27,863 --> 01:16:31,560
一般人会以为情感不能打动他 钱应该可以
You'd think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.

1129
01:16:31,734 --> 01:16:33,292
他有没有跟你说理由是什么?
Did he give any reason?

1130
01:16:33,502 --> 01:16:35,838
他建议我问你  问我?
- He suggested I ask you. - Ask me?

1131
01:16:35,938 --> 01:16:40,009
对  他说: 问你的妻子
Yes, he said, "Ask your wife."

1132
01:16:40,109 --> 01:16:41,872
我不知道他为什么那样说
I don't know why he said that.

1133
01:16:54,423 --> 01:16:57,153
我们外头那位朋友 现在应该以为我们休息了
Well, our friend outside will think we've retired by now.

1134
01:16:58,527 --> 01:17:00,358
我待会儿就去
I'll be going in a few minutes.

1135
01:17:02,431 --> 01:17:04,922
伊莎  我... 什么?
- Ilsa, I... - Yes?

1136
01:17:06,202 --> 01:17:08,466
我在集中营的时候
When I was in the concentration camp...

1137
01:17:09,038 --> 01:17:11,563
你在巴黎寂寞吗?
...were you lonely in Paris?

1138
01:17:13,042 --> 01:17:15,033
对  维多  我是寂寞
Yes, Victor, I was.

1139
01:17:16,011 --> 01:17:18,980
我知道寂寞是什么样子
I know how it is to be lonely.

1140
01:17:20,049 --> 01:17:22,381
有什么事你想要告诉我的吗?
Is there anything you wish to tell me?

1141
01:17:24,386 --> 01:17:26,377
没有  维多
No, Victor, there isn't.

1142
01:17:31,026 --> 01:17:33,551
我非常爱你  亲爱的
Ilove you very much, my dear.

1143
01:17:36,899 --> 01:17:38,890
是  是  我知道
Yes, I know.

1144
01:17:39,735 --> 01:17:42,169
维多  不管我做什么 你会不会相信我...
Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I...?

1145
01:17:42,338 --> 01:17:45,034
你甚至不必说出来
You don't even have to say it.

1146
01:17:45,207 --> 01:17:46,970
我也相信你
I'll believe.

1147
01:17:49,078 --> 01:17:50,409
晚安  亲爱的
Good night, dear.

1148
01:17:52,414 --> 01:17:53,745
晚安
Good night.

1149
01:18:00,789 --> 01:18:03,451
维多 什么事?  亲爱的
- Victor. - Yes, dear?

1150
01:18:08,764 --> 01:18:10,129
要小心
Be careful.

1151
01:18:11,734 --> 01:18:13,292
当然  我会小心
Of course I' II be careful.

1152
01:18:56,645 --> 01:18:59,842
你的情况非常好  瑞克先生
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.

1153
01:19:00,015 --> 01:19:01,684
我可以支持多久不营业
How long can I afford to stay closed?

1154
01:19:01,784 --> 01:19:03,886
两星期或者三星期
Two weeks, maybe three.

1155
01:19:03,986 --> 01:19:06,216
或者我不必关门 以前用贿赂有效
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before.

1156
01:19:06,422 --> 01:19:08,652
目前所有人依旧发薪水
In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.

1157
01:19:08,824 --> 01:19:10,189
谢谢  瑞克先生
Thank you, Herr Rick.

1158
01:19:10,359 --> 01:19:13,726
沙克听到一定很高兴 我欠他钱
Sascha will be happy to hear it. I owe him money.

1159
01:19:14,296 --> 01:19:16,165
你把门锁好  可以吗?  卡尔
- You finish locking up, will you, Carl - I will.

1160
01:19:16,265 --> 01:19:20,502
我会的 然后我要去开会... 别告诉我你去那里
- Then I am going to the meeting... - Don't tell me where you're going.

1161
01:19:20,602 --> 01:19:21,796
我不会
I won't.

1162
01:19:22,972 --> 01:19:24,030
晚安
Good night.

1163
01:19:25,174 --> 01:19:26,766
晚安  瑞克先生
Good night, Mr. Rick.

1164
01:19:43,425 --> 01:19:46,826
你怎么进来的?  街外的楼梯
- How did you get in? - The stairs from the street.

1165
01:19:46,996 --> 01:19:48,329
今天早上我跟你说有空来坐
I told you this morning you'd come around,

1166
01:19:48,336 --> 01:19:50,329
不过这似乎比预定的稍早了点
but this is ahead of schedule.

1167
01:19:50,499 --> 01:19:51,727
你不坐下来吗?
Well, won't you sit down?

1168
01:19:51,934 --> 01:19:54,737
理查  我必须见你 再度叫理查  我们回到巴黎了
- Richard, I had to see you. - "Richard" again. We're back in Paris.

1169
01:19:54,837 --> 01:19:55,826
求求你
Please.

1170
01:19:56,005 --> 01:19:59,304
你的突然来访是否有可能 跟那些过境信有关呢?
Your visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit?

1171
01:19:59,508 --> 01:20:02,204
似乎只要信一天还在我手上  我就不愁寂寞了
Seems as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.

1172
01:20:02,378 --> 01:20:05,006
你要多少钱都可以  不过你一定要把那些信给我
Ask any price you want, but you must give me the letters.

1173
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:07,740
我已经跟你的丈夫讲清楚了  绝不交易
I went all through that with your husband. It 's no deal.

1174
01:20:08,317 --> 01:20:10,046
我知道你对我的感受 可是我得要求你为更重要的事
I know how you feel about me...

1175
01:20:10,219 --> 01:20:13,143
先将自己的感受抛在一边
...but put your feelings aside for something more important.

1176
01:20:13,155 --> 01:20:15,623
我又要再听一次 你丈夫有多伟大
I have to hear again what a great man your husband is...

1177
01:20:15,791 --> 01:20:17,782
他为多么重要的目标战斗吗?
...what an important cause he's fighting for?

1178
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:19,291
那也是你的目标
It was your cause too.

1179
01:20:19,495 --> 01:20:21,963
以你自己的方式 你也为相同的目标战斗
In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.

1180
01:20:22,398 --> 01:20:25,094
我不再为任何事战斗了 除了为自己
I'm not fighting for anything anymore except myself.

1181
01:20:25,334 --> 01:20:27,325
我唯一感兴趣的目标是自己
I'm the only cause I' m interested in.

1182
01:20:32,608 --> 01:20:37,513
理查  我们曾经相爱过 如果那些日子对你有意义
We loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you...

1183
01:20:37,613 --> 01:20:40,548
如果我是你就不会提起巴黎 那是差劲的推销把戏
I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.

1184
01:20:40,716 --> 01:20:43,312
求求你听我说 如果你知道事实是怎么回事
Listen to me. If you knew what really happened,

1185
01:20:43,313 --> 01:20:46,412
如果你知道事情的真相 不管你说什么我也不会相信
if you only knew the truth. I wouldn't believe you no matter what you said.

1186
01:20:46,588 --> 01:20:49,614
为了达到目的 你现在什么也说得出口
You'd say anything now to get what you want.

1187
01:20:53,862 --> 01:20:56,592
你很遗撼  是吗?
You want to feel sorry for yourself, don't you?

1188
01:20:56,765 --> 01:20:59,529
那么多事危在旦夕 你想到的只有自己的感觉
With so much at stake all you can think of is your feelings.

1189
01:21:00,169 --> 01:21:03,706
一个女人伤害了你 你便对全世界报复
One woman has hurt you, and you take your revenge on the rest of the world.

1190
01:21:03,806 --> 01:21:06,965
你是...个胆小鬼  弱者...
You're a coward and a weakling.

1191
01:21:10,379 --> 01:21:13,246
不  不  理查  对不起
No. Oh, Richard. I' m sorry.

1192
01:21:14,316 --> 01:21:17,285
对不起  可是... 可是你是我们最后的希望
I'm sorry, but you are our last hope.

1193
01:21:17,453 --> 01:21:20,149
如果你不帮我们 维多拉斯路会死在卡萨布兰卡
If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.

1194
01:21:20,389 --> 01:21:21,378
那又怎样?
What of it?

1195
01:21:21,557 --> 01:21:24,219
我也会死在卡萨布兰卡 这是死亡的好地方
I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.

1196
01:21:31,066 --> 01:21:32,897
现在  如果你...
Now, if you'll...

1197
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:36,567
好吧
All right.

1198
01:21:36,738 --> 01:21:38,763
我尝试跟你讲道理
I tried to reason with you.

1199
01:21:38,941 --> 01:21:41,171
我什么法子也试了 现在我要那些信
I tried everything. Now, I want those letters.

1200
01:21:41,577 --> 01:21:45,311
去拿给我  我不必去拿  就在这里
- Get them for me. - I don't have to. I got them right here.

1201
01:21:46,281 --> 01:21:48,146
放在桌上
Put them on the table.

1202
01:21:50,052 --> 01:21:51,041
不
No.

1203
01:21:52,154 --> 01:21:54,247
最后一次  放在桌上
For the last time, put them on the table.

1204
01:21:55,557 --> 01:21:59,955
如果拉斯路和他的目标对你那么重要 什么也挡不住你
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything.

1205
01:22:00,963 --> 01:22:02,954
好吧  我让你更方便一点
All right, I'll make it easier for you.

1206
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:09,097
开枪吧  你将会帮了我一个忙
Go ahead and shoot. You'll be doing me a favor.

1207
01:22:14,009 --> 01:22:15,909
理查
Richard...

1208
01:22:16,078 --> 01:22:18,444
我尽量避开你
...I tried to stay away.

1209
01:22:18,814 --> 01:22:21,476
我以为我永远不会再见到你
I thought I would never see you again.

1210
01:22:22,618 --> 01:22:25,086
你已经在我生命中消失
That you were out of my life.

1211
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:47,365
你离开巴黎的那天
The day you left Paris...

1212
01:22:48,944 --> 01:22:50,935
如果你知道我的感受
...if you knew what I went through.

1213
01:22:52,614 --> 01:22:55,276
如果你知道我多爱你
If you knew how much I loved you.

1214
01:22:56,285 --> 01:22:59,118
我仍然有多么爱你
How much I still love you.

1215
01:23:13,001 --> 01:23:14,025
然后呢?
And then?

1216
01:23:16,071 --> 01:23:20,405
我们结婚后不久维多回到捷克
It wasrt long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.

1217
01:23:20,576 --> 01:23:24,103
他们需要他在布拉格 可是秘密警察在等着他
They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him.

1218
01:23:24,279 --> 01:23:26,008
只看到报上的两行小启
Just a two-line item in the paper:

1219
01:23:26,181 --> 01:23:28,809
维多拉斯路被逮捕送往集中营
"Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp."

1220
01:23:29,985 --> 01:23:32,317
我发狂一般 好几个月我努力打听消息
I was frantic. For months I tried to get word.

1221
01:23:32,588 --> 01:23:33,816
消息终于来了
Then it came.

1222
01:23:34,022 --> 01:23:36,183
他死了 逃走的时候被枪打死
He was dead. Shot trying to escape.

1223
01:23:37,492 --> 01:23:39,983
我好寂寞  我一无所有 连希望也没有
I was lonely. I had nothing, not even hope.

1224
01:23:41,396 --> 01:23:42,829
后来我遇上你
Then I met you.

1225
01:23:43,165 --> 01:23:46,498
为什么你不对我诚实说?  为什么你守着结婚的秘密?
Why werert you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret?

1226
01:23:46,702 --> 01:23:49,872
那不是我的秘密  理查 是维多要那样
It wasrt my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way.

1227
01:23:49,972 --> 01:23:52,497
甚至我们最要好的朋友 也不知道我们的婚事
Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage.

1228
01:23:52,941 --> 01:23:54,810
那是他保护我的方法  关于他的工作我知道太多了
That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work.

1229
01:23:54,910 --> 01:23:57,913
如果秘密警察发现我是他妻子
If the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me...

1230
01:23:58,013 --> 01:24:01,650
那会为我和地下工作者 带来危险
...and for those working with us.

1231
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:04,082
你什么时候发现他仍然活着?
And when did you first find out he was alive?

1232
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:07,645
刚好我们准备一起离开巴黎前
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together.

1233
01:24:07,823 --> 01:24:10,257
一个朋友前来告诉我维多活着
A friend came and told me that Victor was alive.

1234
01:24:10,425 --> 01:24:13,553
他们把他藏在巴黎市郊的 一节货运车厢上
They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris.

1235
01:24:13,895 --> 01:24:15,886
他生病需要我
He was sick. He needed me.

1236
01:24:17,466 --> 01:24:20,094
我想告诉你可是我不敢
I wanted to tell you, but I didn't dare.

1237
01:24:20,269 --> 01:24:22,604
我知道  你一定不会离开巴黎  秘密警察便会捉到你
I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you.

1238
01:24:22,704 --> 01:24:27,003
所以我...
Well...

1239
01:24:27,342 --> 01:24:29,003
其余的你已知道了
...well, you know the rest.

1240
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:35,040
仍然是一个没有结局的故事
Well, it's still a story without an ending.

1241
01:24:35,217 --> 01:24:36,343
那现在呢?
What about now?

1242
01:24:37,586 --> 01:24:38,575
现在?
Now?

1243
01:24:39,388 --> 01:24:40,912
我不知道
I don't know.

1244
01:24:41,590 --> 01:24:44,616
我知道我再没有勇气离开你
I know that I' II never have the strength to leave you again.

1245
01:24:45,827 --> 01:24:46,885
那拉斯路呢?
And Laszlo?

1246
01:24:47,262 --> 01:24:49,398
你会帮助他的 理查  对不对?  你设法使他离境
You'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out.

1247
01:24:49,498 --> 01:24:54,065
他便能拥有他的工作 他生存的所有意义
Then he'll have his work. All that he's been living for.

1248
01:24:54,169 --> 01:24:55,659
除了一样
All except one.

1249
01:24:57,139 --> 01:24:58,572
他将没有你
He won't have you.

1250
01:25:00,709 --> 01:25:02,472
我无法再挣扎下去
I can't fight it anymore.

1251
01:25:04,246 --> 01:25:06,578
我曾舍你而去 第二次我做不到
I ran away from you once. I can't do it again.

1252
01:25:09,551 --> 01:25:12,611
我再也不知道 什么是对什么是错
Oh, I don't know what's right any longer.

1253
01:25:12,788 --> 01:25:14,847
你必须为我们两个想
You have to think for both of us.

1254
01:25:15,857 --> 01:25:17,256
为我们所有人想
For all of us.

1255
01:25:20,862 --> 01:25:23,524
好吧  我会的
All right. I will.

1256
01:25:27,669 --> 01:25:29,364
永志不忘
Here's looking at you, kid.

1257
01:25:31,173 --> 01:25:34,267
我希望我没有那么爱你
I wish I didn't love you so much.

1258
01:25:46,655 --> 01:25:47,923
我想我们甩掉他们了
- I think we lost them. - Yes.

1259
01:25:48,023 --> 01:25:52,723
对  我恐怕他们抓到其他的人 进里面去
- I' m afraid they caught some of the others. - Come inside.

1260
01:25:56,365 --> 01:26:01,234
来  拉斯路先生 我会立刻帮你
Come, Mr. Laszlo, I will help you immediately.

1261
01:26:01,470 --> 01:26:03,233
谢谢
Thank you.

1262
01:26:20,689 --> 01:26:22,850
卡尔  怎么回事?
Carl, what happened?

1263
01:26:23,024 --> 01:26:26,762
警察查获我们的会议 瑞克先生 我们刚好来得及逃走
The police break up our meeting, Herr Rick. We escaped at the last moment.

1264
01:26:26,862 --> 01:26:29,160
上来一下 好  我来
- Come up here a minute. - Yes, I come.

1265
01:26:29,331 --> 01:26:32,734
我要你把后门关掉 可能会引起警察的注意
Turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.

1266
01:26:32,834 --> 01:26:36,138
沙克每天都会关的 今晚他忘记了
- But Sascha always puts out that light. - Tonight he forgot.

1267
01:26:36,238 --> 01:26:38,468
好  我来了  我会去关
Yes, I come. I will do it.

1268
01:26:46,148 --> 01:26:49,640
我要你送林小姐回家 好的
- I want you to take Miss Lund home. - Yes, sir.

1269
01:27:00,629 --> 01:27:03,757
没什么  只是小小的割伤 我们被迫从窗户爬出来
It's nothing, just a little cut. We had to get through a window.

1270
01:27:03,932 --> 01:27:05,695
这可能有帮助
This might come in handy.

1271
01:27:05,901 --> 01:27:06,993
谢谢
Thank you.

1272
01:27:07,235 --> 01:27:09,829
千钧一发?  对  挺危险
- Had a close one, eh? - Yes, rather.

1273
01:27:11,873 --> 01:27:14,603
你有时候会不会想这值得吗?
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's won'th all this?

1274
01:27:14,776 --> 01:27:16,710
我是指你战斗的目标
I mean, what you're fighting for.

1275
01:27:17,712 --> 01:27:19,805
我不如问为什么我们要呼吸
We might as well question why we breathe.

1276
01:27:19,981 --> 01:27:21,539
如果我们不呼吸  我们就会死
If we stop breathing, we'll die.

1277
01:27:21,716 --> 01:27:24,150
如果我们停止对抗敌人 世界就会死
If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.

1278
01:27:24,319 --> 01:27:26,583
又怎样?  苦难就结束了
What of it? Then it'll be out of its misery.

1279
01:27:26,755 --> 01:27:28,916
你知道你的口气像什么吗?
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine?

1280
01:27:29,090 --> 01:27:31,254
像一个拿内心不相信的事情
Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something...

1281
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:33,254
来说服自己的人
...he doesn't believe in his heart.

1282
01:27:33,428 --> 01:27:37,466
我们每一个人都有一个目标 善意的  或邪恶的
Each of us has a destiny. For good, or for evil.

1283
01:27:37,566 --> 01:27:40,091
我明白了 我怀疑你是否真明白
- I get the point. - I wonder if you do.

1284
01:27:40,435 --> 01:27:43,529
我怀疑你知不知道 你在逃避自己
I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself...

1285
01:27:43,738 --> 01:27:45,296
你将永远不会成功
...and that you'll never succeed.

1286
01:27:45,474 --> 01:27:47,704
你似乎对我的目标t如指掌
You seem to know all about my destiny.

1287
01:27:49,511 --> 01:27:52,105
我知道关于你的事 比你怀疑的多
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect.

1288
01:27:52,481 --> 01:27:54,676
例如我知道你爱上一个女人
I know that you're in love with a woman.

1289
01:27:54,883 --> 01:27:56,646
或者这是一种奇怪的现象
It's perhaps a strange circumstance...

1290
01:27:56,818 --> 01:27:59,719
我们两个会爱着同一个女人
...that we both should be in love with the same woman.

1291
01:27:59,888 --> 01:28:02,049
我走进这咖啡馆的第一个晚上
The first evening I came into this cafe...

1292
01:28:02,224 --> 01:28:04,590
我知道 你和伊莎之间有些不寻常
...I knew there was something between you and llsa.

1293
01:28:05,393 --> 01:28:07,054
既然不能责怪任何人
Since no one is to blame...

1294
01:28:07,496 --> 01:28:09,487
我不要求解释 我只要求一件事
...I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing.

1295
01:28:09,664 --> 01:28:14,770
你不愿给我过境信函  没关系
You won't give me the letters of transit. All right.

1296
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:16,804
不过我要我的妻子安全
But I want my wife to be safe.

1297
01:28:17,072 --> 01:28:18,505
我请求你帮忙
I ask you as a favor...

1298
01:28:18,673 --> 01:28:21,608
用那些信带她离开卡萨布兰卡
...to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.

1299
01:28:21,776 --> 01:28:22,868
你那么爱她吗?
You love her that much?

1300
01:28:23,078 --> 01:28:25,842
或者你只把我想成 一个主义的领导者
Apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause.

1301
01:28:26,481 --> 01:28:29,006
我也是个人
Well, I am also a human being.

1302
01:28:29,851 --> 01:28:31,341
对  我是那么爱她
Yes, I love her that much.

1303
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:40,457
拉斯路先生 什么事?
- Monsieur Laszlo? - Yes?

1304
01:28:40,629 --> 01:28:43,154
你跟我们走 我们有你的逮捕令
You'll come with us. We have a warrant for your arrest.

1305
01:28:43,331 --> 01:28:44,320
什么罪名?
On what charge?

1306
01:28:44,499 --> 01:28:46,694
雷诺队长稍后会跟你讨论
Captain Renault will discuss that with you later.

1307
01:28:46,868 --> 01:28:49,598
似乎命运正在插手
It seems that destiny has taken a hand.

1308
01:29:01,383 --> 01:29:03,620
你没有实在的证据  你也知道
You haven't any proof, and you know it.

1309
01:29:03,633 --> 01:29:05,620
这里是未被占领的法国  不是德国
This isn't Germany or occupied France.

1310
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:07,986
你能做的只是罚他几千法O 或者拘禁30天
All you can do is fine him and give him 30 days.

1311
01:29:07,990 --> 01:29:09,886
不如现在放他
You might as well let him go now.

1312
01:29:09,958 --> 01:29:12,984
瑞克  我奉劝你不要对 拉斯路发生的事太感兴趣
I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo.

1313
01:29:13,161 --> 01:29:14,628
如果你企图帮他逃走
If you were to help him escape...

1314
01:29:14,796 --> 01:29:17,230
你为什么认为 我会为拉斯路冒险
What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?

1315
01:29:17,399 --> 01:29:19,867
第一  你赌十万法O他能逃掉
Because, one, you bet 10,000 francs he'd escape.

1316
01:29:20,035 --> 01:29:21,603
第二  你有那些过境信  不必否认了
Two, you've got the letters of transit. Don't bother to deny it.

1317
01:29:21,703 --> 01:29:26,538
你可能会那样做 只为了你不喜欢史查沙的长相
And you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks.

1318
01:29:26,575 --> 01:29:28,440
事实上  我也不喜欢
As a matter of fact, I don't either.

1319
01:29:28,610 --> 01:29:30,009
极佳的理由
They're all excellent reasons.

1320
01:29:30,178 --> 01:29:32,112
别太依赖我的友谊  瑞克
Don't count too much on my friendship.

1321
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:35,984
在这件事上  我无能为力 况且我可能输十万法O
In this matter I' m powerless. Besides, I might lose the 10,000 francs.

1322
01:29:36,084 --> 01:29:40,646
你不算很奸滑  不过很有效 我明白你的意思
You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I get the point.

1323
01:29:40,822 --> 01:29:42,312
对  我有那些信
Yes, I have the letters.

1324
01:29:42,524 --> 01:29:44,321
但是我打算自己用
But I intend using them myself.

1325
01:29:44,726 --> 01:29:48,253
我要搭今晚最后的班机 离开卡萨布兰卡
I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane. The last plane.

1326
01:29:48,430 --> 01:29:51,490
我要带一位朋友一道走 一位你会赞赏的朋友
And I' m taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.

1327
01:29:51,666 --> 01:29:53,634
什么朋友?  伊莎林
- What friend? - Ilsa Lund.

1328
01:29:53,802 --> 01:29:57,397
可以打消你认为 我会帮忙拉斯路逃走的想法吧
That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape.

1329
01:29:57,572 --> 01:29:59,597
我最不愿意在美国看到的人
The last man I want to see in America.

1330
01:29:59,841 --> 01:30:03,142
你来这里不是为了告诉我这些 你有过境信
You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit.

1331
01:30:03,211 --> 01:30:06,374
你可以填上你和她的名字 爱什么时候走都可以
You can fill in your name and hers and leave anytime you please.

1332
01:30:06,548 --> 01:30:09,176
为什么你仍然对 拉斯路的境遇感兴趣
Why are you still interested in what happens to Laszlo?

1333
01:30:09,384 --> 01:30:13,582
我没有  不过我对伊莎和我 以后的境遇感兴趣
I'm not. But I am interested in what happens to llsa and me.

1334
01:30:13,822 --> 01:30:15,790
我们有合法权利离开是不是
We have a legal right to go, that's true...

1335
01:30:15,957 --> 01:30:19,484
不过即使有合法的权利 曾经也有人被留在卡萨布兰卡
...but people have been held in Casablanca in spite of their legal rights.

1336
01:30:19,661 --> 01:30:23,197
为什么你认为我们会留置你 伊莎是拉斯路的妻子
- What makes you think we want to hold you? - Ilsa is Laszlo 's wife.

1337
01:30:23,198 --> 01:30:25,894
她大概知道一些 史查沙想知道的事
She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know.

1338
01:30:26,067 --> 01:30:27,591
路易  我跟你来一项协议
Louis, I' II make a deal with you.

1339
01:30:27,769 --> 01:30:31,296
不用这项你加给他的小罪名 而找些真正的大罪名
Instead of this petty charge against him, you could get something big...

1340
01:30:31,473 --> 01:30:34,738
可叫他待在集中营好几年的
...something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years...

1341
01:30:34,909 --> 01:30:37,503
可是大功一件  对不?  不错
- Be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it? - Certainly.

1342
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:39,840
德国和维琪政府会很感激
Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.

1343
01:30:40,048 --> 01:30:41,072
那就释放他
Then release him.

1344
01:30:41,249 --> 01:30:43,877
飞机起飞前半小时你到我的店
You be at my place a half -hour before the plane leaves.

1345
01:30:44,052 --> 01:30:46,577
我安排拉斯路来拿过境信
I'll have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters...

1346
01:30:46,788 --> 01:30:49,382
那便给你犯罪的证据以逮捕他
...and that'll give you grounds to make the arrest.

1347
01:30:49,658 --> 01:30:51,956
你逮到他  而我们逃掉了
You get him, and we get away.

1348
01:30:52,127 --> 01:30:55,028
对德国人来说 后者只会带来轻度的苦恼
To the Germans, that last will be just a minor annoyance.

1349
01:30:55,230 --> 01:30:58,028
这交易我还有些地方不太明白
There's still something about this I don't quite understand.

1350
01:30:58,233 --> 01:31:00,929
林小姐  她非常美丽  不错
Miss Lund, she is very beautiful, yes...

1351
01:31:01,102 --> 01:31:03,434
可是你从不对任何女人感兴趣
...but you were never interested in any woman.

1352
01:31:03,605 --> 01:31:06,233
她不只是任何女人 我明白了
- She isn't just any woman. - I see.

1353
01:31:06,841 --> 01:31:09,241
我怎么知道你会守信
How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?

1354
01:31:09,411 --> 01:31:12,278
我马上在探访室 跟拉斯路安排好
I'll make the arrangements now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.

1355
01:31:12,447 --> 01:31:14,085
瑞克  我将会怀念你
I'm gonna miss you.

1356
01:31:14,107 --> 01:31:17,085
很明显你是在卡萨布兰卡 唯一比我更无顾忌的人
You're the only one in Casablanca who has less scruples than I.

1357
01:31:17,185 --> 01:31:18,447
谢谢
Oh, thanks.

1358
01:31:19,087 --> 01:31:20,179
去吧  瑞克
Go ahead, Ricky.

1359
01:31:20,388 --> 01:31:22,826
你放他走后调走你的看门狗
Call off your watchdogs when you let him go.

1360
01:31:22,838 --> 01:31:24,826
我不要他今天下午在附近
I don't want them around this afternoon.

1361
01:31:24,926 --> 01:31:27,258
我不能冒险  路易  即使跟你
I'm taking no chances, Louis, not even with you.

1362
01:31:34,869 --> 01:31:37,429
我们要不要签一份文件 还是握手就够了
Should we draw up papers, or is a handshake good enough?

1363
01:31:37,605 --> 01:31:40,870
当然是不够  不过我很忙 只好这样了
Certainly not good enough. But since I' m in a hurry, it'll have to do.

1364
01:31:41,176 --> 01:31:44,613
离开卡萨布兰卡去美国 你是幸运的人
To get out of Casablanca and go to America... You're a lucky man.

1365
01:31:44,713 --> 01:31:48,173
我跟山姆的协定一直是 他得到利润的百分之二十五
My agreement with Sam is that he gets 25 percent of the profits.

1366
01:31:48,203 --> 01:31:50,173
那仍然维持
That still goes.

1367
01:31:50,285 --> 01:31:53,083
我凑巧知道是百分之十 不过他值百分之二十五
I happen to know he gets 10 percent. But he's won'th 25.

1368
01:31:53,254 --> 01:31:56,223
阿都  卡尔和沙克要留在店里 不然我不卖
Abdul, Carl and Sascha, they stay with the place or I don't sell.

1369
01:31:56,424 --> 01:31:58,858
当然 没有他们就不是瑞克咖啡馆
Of course. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.

1370
01:31:59,027 --> 01:32:00,358
再会
Well, so long.

1371
01:32:00,528 --> 01:32:03,554
别忘了 你欠咖啡馆一百箱美国烟
Don't forget you owe Rick's 100 can'tons of American cigarettes.

1372
01:32:03,732 --> 01:32:06,223
我会记得付给自己
I shall remember to pay it to myself.

1373
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:18,442
“关闭，警察首长命令”

1374
01:32:41,202 --> 01:32:42,003
你迟到了  我接到通知拉斯路刚离开饭店
- You're late. - I was informed when Laszlo left the hotel...

1375
01:32:42,103 --> 01:32:45,473
我会来得及的
...so I knew I' d be on time.

1376
01:32:45,573 --> 01:32:47,177
我想我说过 把你的看门狗绑起来
- I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.

1377
01:32:47,178 --> 01:32:48,677
不会有人跟踪他来这里
- He won't be followed here.

1378
01:32:48,777 --> 01:32:50,870
你知道没有你 这地方会完全不一样
This place will never be the same without you.

1379
01:32:51,079 --> 01:32:52,210
我知道你的意思 可是我已经跟法拉利说好
I know what you mean. But I' ve spoken to Ferrari.

1380
01:32:52,219 --> 01:32:54,610
你在轮盘上仍然可以赢
You'll still win at roulette.

1381
01:32:54,783 --> 01:32:57,513
一切都准备好了吗?  信就在这
- Is everything ready? - I have the letters right here.

1382
01:32:57,685 --> 01:32:59,880
告诉我 我们搜查时藏在那里?
When we searched the place, where were they?

1383
01:33:00,054 --> 01:33:01,214
山姆的钢琴
Sam's piano.

1384
01:33:01,956 --> 01:33:03,890
我活该  没有音乐细胞
Serves me right for not being musical.

1385
01:33:04,159 --> 01:33:05,183
他们来了
Here they are.

1386
01:33:05,693 --> 01:33:07,422
你最好到我办公室等
You better wait in my office.

1387
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:17,064
拿去

1388
01:33:17,138 --> 01:33:19,174
理查  维多以为我跟他一起走  你没有告诉他吗?
Victor thinks I' m leaving with him. Havert you told him?

1389
01:33:19,274 --> 01:33:21,643
不  还没有 可是没有关系对不对?
- Not yet. - But you were able to arrange everything?

1390
01:33:21,743 --> 01:33:23,875
你已经安排好一切 一切都很好
Everything is quite all right.

1391
01:33:24,045 --> 01:33:25,046
我们在机场告诉他  越少时间去想  对大家越好过
We'll tell him at the airport. The less time to think, the easier.

1392
01:33:25,146 --> 01:33:29,079
请相信我
Please trust me.

1393
01:33:31,119 --> 01:33:32,347
是  我会
Yes, I will.

1394
01:33:37,559 --> 01:33:39,655
宾勒先生 我不知道如何感谢你
- I don't know how to thank you.

1395
01:33:39,659 --> 01:33:41,655
省省吧  我们还有很多事要做
- Save it. We've still lots of things to do.

1396
01:33:43,464 --> 01:33:46,558
我把钱带走了  宾勒先生 留着吧  在美国你会需要的
- I brought the money. - Keep it, you'll need it in America.

1397
01:33:46,968 --> 01:33:48,868
可是我们协定过 别管它
- But we made a deal. - Never mind that.

1398
01:33:49,037 --> 01:33:52,404
你在里斯本不会有麻烦吧?  不会  一切都安排好了
- You won't have any trouble in Lisbon? - No. It 's all arranged.

1399
01:33:52,507 --> 01:33:54,839
很好  信就在这里  从没用过
Good. I' ve got the letters here, made out in blank.

1400
01:33:55,009 --> 01:33:57,443
你只要补上签名就好了
All you have to do is fill in the signatures.

1401
01:33:57,612 --> 01:33:59,011
维多拉斯路
Victor Laszlo.

1402
01:33:59,547 --> 01:34:02,277
维多拉斯路  你被捕了
Victor Laszlo, you're under arrest.

1403
01:34:04,886 --> 01:34:06,879
罪名是  快递员谋杀案的帮凶
The charge of accessory to the murder of the couriers from...

1404
01:34:06,886 --> 01:34:08,879
这些信是从他们身上偷的
...whom the letters were stolen.

1405
01:34:09,490 --> 01:34:11,426
对 你对我的朋友瑞克感到意外  理由很简单
You're surprised about my friend Ricky? The explanation is simple.

1406
01:34:11,526 --> 01:34:16,327
爱情似乎战胜德行  谢谢...
Love, it seems, has triumphed over virtue. Thank...

1407
01:34:16,698 --> 01:34:21,135
且慢  路易  不会有人被捕 起码不是现在
Not so fast, Louis. Nobody is going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.

1408
01:34:21,302 --> 01:34:22,303
你是不是疯了?
- Have you lost your mind? - I have. Sit down.

1409
01:34:22,403 --> 01:34:24,472
我是  到那边坐下 把枪放下  路易  我不想开枪打你
- Put that gun down. - I don't want to shoot you...

1410
01:34:24,572 --> 01:34:28,303
但如果你再踏一步我会的
...but I will if you take one more step.

1411
01:34:28,343 --> 01:34:30,573
在这情况下  我会坐下
Under the circumstances, I will sit down.

1412
01:34:33,815 --> 01:34:35,410
把手放在桌上 我猜你知道你在做什么
- Keep your hands on the table.

1413
01:34:35,415 --> 01:34:37,410
不过我怀疑你知否这代表什么
- I wonder if you realize what this means.

1414
01:34:37,485 --> 01:34:39,612
我知道 待会儿我们有很多时间讨论
I do. We've got time to discuss that later.

1415
01:34:39,787 --> 01:34:41,379
调走你的看门狗  你说的
Call off your watchdogs, you said.

1416
01:34:41,556 --> 01:34:42,924
同样的  你打电话到机场  让我听到你告诉他们
Just the same, call the airport and let me hear you tell them.

1417
01:34:43,024 --> 01:34:46,892
记得这把枪正对着你的心脏
And remember, this gun is pointed right at your heart.

1418
01:34:46,928 --> 01:34:49,021
那是我最不脆弱的地方
That is my least vulnerable spot.

1419
01:34:56,571 --> 01:34:58,630
哈罗  是机场吗?
Hello? Is that the airport?

1420
01:34:59,941 --> 01:35:01,602
我是雷诺队长
This is Captain Renault speaking.

1421
01:35:01,809 --> 01:35:04,369
有两份过境信要用来搭乘 往里斯本的班机
There'll be two letters of transit for the Lisbon plane.

1422
01:35:04,545 --> 01:35:06,342
绝不能阻止他们
There's to be no trouble about them.

1423
01:35:06,781 --> 01:35:07,770
好
Good.

1424
01:35:08,216 --> 01:35:09,376
哈罗?  哈罗?
Hello?

1425
01:35:14,489 --> 01:35:15,888
我的车  快点 是  少校
My car, quickly!

1426
01:35:17,558 --> 01:35:18,650
我是史查沙少校
This is Major Strasser.

1427
01:35:18,826 --> 01:35:21,294
马上派一队警员 到机场跟我会合
Have a squad of police meet me at the airport at once.

1428
01:35:21,462 --> 01:35:22,759
马上  你听到吗?
At once, do you hear?

1429
01:35:29,904 --> 01:35:31,929
喂  控制塔  听得到吗?
Hello, radio tower?

1430
01:35:32,106 --> 01:35:35,470
往里斯本的班机十分钟后起飞 东跑道
Lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes, east runway.

1431
01:35:35,476 --> 01:35:37,944
能见度一又二分之一哩
Visibility, 11/2 miles.

1432
01:35:38,112 --> 01:35:42,048
地面薄雾的深度大约五百
Light ground fog. Depth of fog approximately 500.

1433
01:35:42,216 --> 01:35:44,946
上升高度不受限制  谢谢
Ceiling unlimited. Thank you.

1434
01:35:57,465 --> 01:36:00,195
路易  叫你的手下 随拉斯路先生去安置好行李
Have your man go with Laszlo and take care of his luggage.

1435
01:36:00,368 --> 01:36:02,131
当然  瑞克  一切依你
Certainly, Rick, anything you say.

1436
01:36:02,337 --> 01:36:04,505
拿拉斯路的行李放在飞机上
- Find Laszlo 's luggage. Put it on the plane. - Yes, sir.

1437
01:36:04,605 --> 01:36:07,199
是  长官 请走这边
This way, please.

1438
01:36:08,776 --> 01:36:11,904
如果你不介意  你填上名字 那会更正式一点
If you don't mind, fill in the names. That'll make it more official.

1439
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:14,105
你什么都设想周到  对不对?
You think of everything, don't you?

1440
01:36:14,282 --> 01:36:16,716
名字是维多拉斯路先生太太
And the names are Mr. And Mrs. Victor Laszlo.

1441
01:36:16,918 --> 01:36:20,555
可是  为什么是我的名字 理查 因为你要上那架飞机
- But why my name, Richard? - Because you're getting on that plane.

1442
01:36:20,655 --> 01:36:22,247
我不明白  那你呢?
I don't understand. What about you?

1443
01:36:22,423 --> 01:36:24,516
我留在这里看着他 等飞机安全离开为止
I'm staying with him till the plane gets away.

1444
01:36:24,692 --> 01:36:26,683
不  理查  你怎么回事?  昨晚
No. What has happened? Last night you said...

1445
01:36:26,861 --> 01:36:28,658
昨晚我们说了很多
Last night we said a great many things.

1446
01:36:28,830 --> 01:36:30,730
你说我要为我俩考虑
You said I was to do the thinking for us.

1447
01:36:30,898 --> 01:36:33,560
自那时候起我想了很多 想来想去只有一个结论
I've done a lot of it since then. It adds up to one thing:

1448
01:36:33,735 --> 01:36:36,536
你跟维多一起上那架飞机 你是属于他的
You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.

1449
01:36:36,571 --> 01:36:38,402
你非听我说不可
Now, you've got to listen to me.

1450
01:36:38,573 --> 01:36:41,474
知不知道如果你留在这里 会有什么后果
Any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here?

1451
01:36:41,642 --> 01:36:45,013
十分之九的机会 我们两个将被关在集中营 对不对?
Chances are we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. True, Louis?

1452
01:36:45,113 --> 01:36:47,478
我恐怕史查沙少校会坚持要
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.

1453
01:36:47,548 --> 01:36:51,117
你这样说只是为了叫我走 我这样说是因为那是事实
- You're saying this only to make me go. - I' m saying it because it's true.

1454
01:36:51,185 --> 01:36:53,415
我们的心里都明白你属于维多
Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor.

1455
01:36:53,588 --> 01:36:55,954
你是他工作的一部分 他的精神鼓励
You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going.

1456
01:36:56,124 --> 01:36:58,991
如果飞机离地  你不在上面 你会后悔的
If that plane leaves and you're not with him, you'll regret it.

1457
01:36:59,193 --> 01:37:01,596
或者不是今天 或者不是明天  不过很快
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.

1458
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:05,757
并且是后悔一辈子 那我们呢?
But what about us?

1459
01:37:05,833 --> 01:37:07,232
我们永远拥有巴黎
We'll always have Paris.

1460
01:37:07,402 --> 01:37:10,705
本来没有 你来卡萨布兰卡后我们失去了
We didn't have... We'd lost it until you came to Casablanca.

1461
01:37:10,805 --> 01:37:12,466
不过昨晚我们重拾回来
We got it back last night.

1462
01:37:13,374 --> 01:37:16,244
昨晚我说我永远不离开你  你永远不会
- When I said I would never leave you. - And you never will.

1463
01:37:16,344 --> 01:37:19,247
我也有工作要做
But I' ve got a job to do too.

1464
01:37:19,347 --> 01:37:23,078
我要去的地方你不能跟来 我要做的事你无法参与
Where I' m going, you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of.

1465
01:37:23,684 --> 01:37:25,208
伊莎  清高我并不在行
Ilsa, I' m no good at being noble.

1466
01:37:25,386 --> 01:37:27,588
不过要明白也不难
But it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people...

1467
01:37:27,688 --> 01:37:31,793
在这疯狂的世界 三个小人物就别太计较了
...don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.

1468
01:37:31,893 --> 01:37:34,418
总有一天你会明白的
Someday you'll understand that.

1469
01:37:35,596 --> 01:37:37,359
而现在...
Now, now.

1470
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,298
永志不忘
Here's looking at you, kid.

1471
01:37:56,451 --> 01:37:58,942
一切都就绪  除了一件事
- Everything is in order. - All except one thing.

1472
01:37:59,187 --> 01:38:01,314
在你离开前有些事你应该知道
There's something you should know.

1473
01:38:01,556 --> 01:38:03,353
宾勒先生 你不要求你解释什么
I don't ask you to explain anything.

1474
01:38:03,524 --> 01:38:06,618
我打算要 因为往后可能会影响到你
I'm going to anyway. It may make a difference to you later on.

1475
01:38:06,794 --> 01:38:08,659
你说你知道伊莎和我的事 对
You said you knew about llsa and me.

1476
01:38:08,830 --> 01:38:11,697
你不知道昨晚你进来时 她正在我的店里
You didn't know she was at my place last night when you were.

1477
01:38:11,866 --> 01:38:15,302
她来是为了过境信  对不?  伊莎
She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, llsa?

1478
01:38:15,736 --> 01:38:16,964
对
Yes.

1479
01:38:17,138 --> 01:38:19,163
可是都没有效
She tried everything to get them. Nothing worked.

1480
01:38:19,340 --> 01:38:22,867
她尽全力让我相信她仍爱着我
She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me.

1481
01:38:23,044 --> 01:38:25,569
那在很久以前就结束了
But that was all over long ago.

1482
01:38:25,746 --> 01:38:27,915
为了你的缘故  她假装不是  我让她继续假装下去
For your sake, she pretended it wasrt, and I let her pretend.

1483
01:38:28,015 --> 01:38:31,219
我明白
I understand.

1484
01:38:31,319 --> 01:38:33,514
拿去 谢谢
- Here it is. - Thanks.

1485
01:38:34,222 --> 01:38:36,019
我很感激
I appreciate it.

1486
01:38:36,891 --> 01:38:38,654
欢迎你回到战线上
Welcome back to the fight.

1487
01:38:38,860 --> 01:38:41,385
这一次我知道我们这边会赢
This time I know our side will win.

1488
01:38:55,109 --> 01:38:57,270
你准备好了吗?  伊莎
Are you ready, llsa?

1489
01:38:59,147 --> 01:39:00,512
对  我准备好了
Yes, I' m ready.

1490
01:39:03,651 --> 01:39:05,016
再见  瑞克
Goodbye, Rick.

1491
01:39:05,887 --> 01:39:07,787
上帝祝福你
God bless you.

1492
01:39:09,123 --> 01:39:11,819
最好赶快不然你会搭不上飞机
You better hurry. You'll miss that plane.

1493
01:39:29,877 --> 01:39:31,811
我是对的 你是个感情用事的人
I was right. You are a sentimentalist.

1494
01:39:31,979 --> 01:39:34,812
留在原地 我不知你在说什么?
Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.

1495
01:39:34,982 --> 01:39:36,313
你刚才为拉斯路做的事
What you just did for Laszlo.

1496
01:39:36,484 --> 01:39:38,884
你为了叫伊莎跟他走 编的童话故事
That fairy tale you invented to send llsa away with him.

1497
01:39:39,053 --> 01:39:40,688
我对女人略知一二  朋友
I know a little about women, my friend. She went.

1498
01:39:40,788 --> 01:39:43,691
她走了  不过她知道你说谎
But she knew you were lying.

1499
01:39:43,791 --> 01:39:45,725
不管如何感谢你帮我忙
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.

1500
01:39:45,893 --> 01:39:50,193
我假定你知道我们都将不好过 特别是你
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us.

1501
01:39:50,364 --> 01:39:54,430
当然我必须逮捕你 飞机一走马上可以  路易
- I' II have to arrest you, of course. - As soon as the plane goes, Louis.

1502
01:40:00,908 --> 01:40:05,773
那通电话是什么意思?  维多拉斯路在那架飞机上
- What was the meaning of that phone call? - Victor Laszlo is on that plane.

1503
01:40:07,815 --> 01:40:09,908
你为何站在这?  你为何不阻止他
Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?

1504
01:40:10,084 --> 01:40:12,109
问瑞克先生
Ask Monsieur Rick.

1505
01:40:14,422 --> 01:40:17,255
离开那电话 我劝你不要干涉
- Get away from that phone. - I advise you not to interfere.

1506
01:40:17,458 --> 01:40:20,723
我愿意开枪打雷诺队长 也会愿意打你
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I' m willing to shoot you.

1507
01:40:22,697 --> 01:40:24,255
哈罗 把电话放下
- Hello! - Put that phone down.

1508
01:40:24,432 --> 01:40:26,297
替我接控制塔 放下!
- Get me the radio tower. - Put it down!

1509
01:40:41,349 --> 01:40:42,907
史查沙少校被射杀
Major Strasser has been shot.

1510
01:40:47,688 --> 01:40:50,316
围捕可疑的嫌犯 是  队长
Round up the usual suspects.

1511
01:41:09,210 --> 01:41:10,404
(维琪矿泉水)

1512
01:41:14,048 --> 01:41:17,711
瑞克  你不只是感情用事 你已变成爱国份子了
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.

1513
01:41:17,885 --> 01:41:20,046
似乎现在是开始的好时机
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.

1514
01:41:20,221 --> 01:41:22,451
我想你是对的
I think perhaps you're right.

1515
01:41:47,248 --> 01:41:50,945
你在卡萨布兰卡消失一段时间 可能是个好主意
It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while.

1516
01:41:51,118 --> 01:41:53,552
在巴撒市那边有自由法国驻军
There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville.

1517
01:41:53,721 --> 01:41:55,890
我可以帮你安排通行  我的过境信
- I could be induced to arrange a passage. - My letter of transit?

1518
01:41:55,990 --> 01:41:59,093
我大可去旅行
I could use a trip.

1519
01:41:59,193 --> 01:42:02,458
那不影响我们的赌注 你仍然欠我十万法O
But it doesn't change our bet. You still owe me 10,000 francs.

1520
01:42:02,697 --> 01:42:05,598
那十万法O应该够我们的开销
That 10,000 francs should pay our expenses.

1521
01:42:05,766 --> 01:42:06,994
我们的开销?
"Our" expenses?

1522
01:42:07,835 --> 01:42:12,033
路易 我想这是美好友谊的开始
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
