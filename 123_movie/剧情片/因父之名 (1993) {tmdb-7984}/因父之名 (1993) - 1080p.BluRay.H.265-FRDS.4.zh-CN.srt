Did I ever tell you the time I jumped ship?

169
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,314
Jumped overboard about 200 yards out to sea...

170
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,900
Swam back to this godforsaken place.

171
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,156
Why did you swim back?

172

There was a woman involved.

Oh, aye?

174
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:49,249
It was when I was healthy, before you were born.

You know your own mother's name. Sarah.

Sarah Maguire she was.

179

Then she had the misfortune to change it to Conlon.

I decided to turn back

to call him Guiseppe for the first time in my life.

198

My mother had given me the address of my Aunt Annie,

I stayed at the squat most of the time.

I was a couple of nights at my Auntie Annie's...

And one night at the hotel after I robbed the money.

I never made any bombs.

She had nothing to do with it.

He says I done Guildford.

561

753
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:40,362
You said, "Gerry, did you foul the ball?"

754

And I walked away from you, do you remember now?

I walked away from you into the dressing room.

And all the other fathers were in there.

and I wrote your name on the ground,

761

I pissed on it...

763
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:06,096
Because I did foul the ball.

764
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:10,016
What did it matter? We won. For once in our lives, we won.

765

You ruined that medal for me!

766
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,353
I took it to the pawn, and they laughed at me.

767
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:14,896
They wouldn't give me 50 pence for it.

768

I've been like this since I was seven.

773
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,702
I remember Mummy said to me,
"Don't upset Guiseppe. He's not well."

774
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,370
(WHISPERING) Oh, dear Lord, he's not well.

775
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:31,705
So we'd tiptoe around the house.

776
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,124
Like this, tiptoeing around the house.

777
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,959
"Not well, you know. He's not well."

778
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,712
Then I got Holy Communion.
I thought I was eating you alive.

779
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,548
I mean, is it my fault you weren't well?

780
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,176
Why did you have to be sick all your life, Guiseppe?

781
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,303
Why did you have to be sick all your life for?

782
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:50,140
When that mad bastard out there threatened
to shoot you, I was happy.

783
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,225
I swear to God. Honest to God, I was happy.

784
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,685
I was delighted! You know why?

785
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:54,978
Because finally it was all over.

786
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,147
It was over! You see?

787
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:00,567
And then I knew I was bad.

788
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,445
I knew I was bad then, you see, so I started to cry.

789
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,822
I started to tell lies, the same fucking lies

790

Relax.

Yeah?

Will you tell them, or shall I tell them?

816

You're my child. It's okay.

817
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,721
It's not your fault, Son, all right?

818
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,683
Everything's gonna be all right.

819
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:18,061
Okay. All right, Son.

820
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:22,190
OFFICER: Visitor for Conlon!

821
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,528
Two on for visit!

822
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:36,830
No touching.

823
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:38,915
Everybody else was allowed to touch.

824
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,668
IRA, closed visits. No contact.

825
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,181
Why are you doing this to us?

826
00:48:57,852 --> 00:48:59,728
You have your father locked up in prison for murder.

GUISEPPE: Take it easy, Sarah.

830
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:12,699
I swear to God, I've done nothing wrong.

831
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,869
Why did you sign a confession, Son?

832
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:18,496
GUISEPPE: He did it to protect me, love.

833
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,416
You have a good son there
and that's all you need to know.

834
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,544
You didn't sign anything yourself, did you, Guiseppe?

835
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,547
The only thing I said was I wanted to see you.

836
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:31,176
Look, they've no statement nor evidence against me.

837
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,303
I'll be out and home soon.

838
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,555
Sure, I'm only visiting here myself.

839
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:39,225
I'll be able to help out Gerry while I'm in here.

840
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:43,938
Danny's dead, Gerry.

841
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,316
What?

842
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:51,363
They found his body on waste ground.

843
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,658
The IRA said he was an incurable thief.

844
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:01,081
I sent a mass card from the family.

845
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:07,504
This one'll not go to school since you've been away.

846
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:09,464
Hey, you go to school for your mummy.

847
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,216
Yes, Daddy.

848
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:14,427
Daddy, when will you be home?

849
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:19,683
SARAH: I've pressed your Sunday suits for the trial.

850
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:22,268
You make sure and look your best now, Son.

851
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:27,565
But is there nitro or was there not nitro?

852
00:50:28,401 --> 00:50:31,277
Yes, there are traces of nitro.

853
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:33,405
But are they all positive?

854
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:36,116
Well, yes, on six of them.

855
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,201
Who'd we miss?

856
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,203
The aunt, Aggie... Annie.

857
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,957
But her rubber glove showed a faint trace.

858
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,918
And the children? The children?

859
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,129
Positive.

860
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:53,967
The results may not be good enough for court.

861
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:57,303
Your word will be good enough for the court.

862
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:00,807

BAILIFF: All rise.

874
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:25,683
Sir Michael Hagerty will present the case
on behalf of the Crown.

875
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:34,067
There are two series of charges here,
ladies and gentlemen.

876
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:36,778
The four defendants in front

877
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:42,450
are charged with 11 counts in relation
to the explosion of the Guildford pub

878
00:52:42,535 --> 00:52:44,828
and the murders of five people.

879
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,248
The Crown will show that these were the bombers.

880
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:50,875
The seven defendants behind

881
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,002
are charged with the possession of explosives.

882
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:54,796
They're not charged with murder.

883
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:57,173
The Crown's case against them is

884
00:52:57,258 --> 00:52:59,884
that they are a support network for the bombers,

885
00:52:59,969 --> 00:53:01,928
and as such should be considered totally independent.

886
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,888
Control yourself. Pay attention.

887
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:08,434
My first witness is Inspector Robert Dixon.

888
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:12,605
"I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence I give shall be the truth,

889
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:15,567
"the whole truth and nothing but the truth."

890
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:22,073
Inspector, why do you believe these four are the bombers?

891
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:27,996
First Hill, then Conlon, Armstrong, Richardson,

892
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,081
confessed to the bombing.

893
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,292
They are the IRA's ASU.

894
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:34,961
Can you explain ASUs for us?

895
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:36,754
Active Service Unit.

896
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:38,214
They are the elite of the IRA,

897
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:40,091
those who carry out the bombings and the shootings.

898
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,051
Very often they are combat veterans

899
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:45,221
with previous experience of shooting at soldiers

900
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:46,347
and planting explosives.

901
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:49,267
And the others, Annie Maguire and her family?

902
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:51,728
They are the IRA's support network.

903
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:53,479
They store...

904
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:56,482
Their families, friends,
they store the weapons and explosives

905
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:59,903
and they provide what we call safe houses.

906
00:54:01,322 --> 00:54:02,614
Thank you, Inspector.

907
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:06,367
Inspector, these people were arrested

908
00:54:06,452 --> 00:54:09,829
two days after the Prevention of Terrorism Act was introduced.

909
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:11,831
That's correct.

910
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:14,834
Can you explain, please,
the powers that this gives to the police?

911
00:54:15,336 --> 00:54:17,754
It permits us to hold suspected terrorists

912
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:19,964
for a period of up to seven days.

913
00:54:20,049 --> 00:54:22,592
Quite extraordinary powers in a democracy.

914
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,385
Quite difficult, I would've thought, for the police

915
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:27,013
to resist the temptation to deal forcibly with people.

916
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,097
Objection.

917
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:30,683
People whom they suspect of the biggest bombing campaign

918
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:33,061
on British mainland since the Second World War.

919
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:34,771
Objection. My Lord, I really must...

920
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:36,230
Get to the point!

921
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:38,316
Now, this bombing campaign

922
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,945
struck deep into the British people's sense of security.

923
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:45,615
The people looked to you, Inspector, to find those responsible.

924
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:46,741
Yes.

925
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:49,619
You must have been under the most intense pressure.

926
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:51,704
That's my job.

927
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:54,916
Now, all of the defendants claim...

928
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,044
Including young Patrick Maguire, aged just 14.

929
00:54:58,587 --> 00:55:01,130
Patrick, would you stand up, please?

930
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:05,051
Thank you. All of the defendants claim

931
00:55:05,594 --> 00:55:09,263
that they were subjected to physical
and mental abuse while under police custody.

932
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:13,559
They were never harmed in any way.

933
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:15,478
He's fucking lying! They beat the shite out of us!

that you pulled him by the hair and squeezed his testicles.

943

Inspector, in the case of the four main defendants,

951
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:04,068
you have no corroborating evidence of any kind.

952
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:07,447
I have the confessions of four obvious terrorists.
What more do you want?

953

Well, nitroglycerine is a highly toxic substance.

Just messed around and that there.

957
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:22,128
They must've been desperate for evidence.

958
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,921
They produced my Auntie Annie's washing-up gloves

Then it was my turn to take the stand.

Mr. Conlon, did you bomb Guildford?

962

No, I didn't.

963
00:56:36,185 --> 00:56:38,561
The police claim that you were in Guildford
on the night of the bombing.

964
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,438
Can you tell us where you were?

965
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:43,357
I was in a park in London at that time.

967

You met somebody else that night, about 8:00 p.m.

969

Aye, I met a man called Charlie Burke.

970
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:54,619
And who is he?

971
00:56:54,703 --> 00:56:57,163
He was just like a, you know, like a fellow,

00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,956
a homeless guy that we met in the park.

973
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,292
Why do you remember this man so clearly?

974
00:57:02,503 --> 00:57:04,921
I remember thinking that if I didn't get out of London fast,

975
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:06,339
I was gonna end up like him.

976
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,759
- You told this to the police?
- Aye.

977
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:10,968
What did they say?

978
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:12,512
They said he didn't exist.

979
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:17,308
Mr. Conlon, why did you confess
to the Guildford bombing?

980
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:20,478
They beat me

981
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,564
and then they threatened to kill my father.

982
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:26,067
Will you repeat that please?

983
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,277
GERRY: They terrorized me for seven days.

984
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:31,030
And after that, they threatened to kill my father.

985
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:33,449
I'd have fucking signed anything after that.

986
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:35,910
Excuse my language.

987
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:36,994
Thank you.

988
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:43,042
You expect this jury to believe that decorated police officers

989
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:46,462
would risk their career and their reputation

990
00:57:46,547 --> 00:57:48,673
by threatening your father?

991
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,467
I don't expect them to believe it
by the time you finish with them,

992
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:53,386
but it happens to be truth, you know.

993
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:55,721
You're an honest man, aren't you, Mr. Conlon?

994
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:58,224
I like to think so.

995
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:02,562
You've told us you remember this Charlie Burke very well.

996
00:58:03,522 --> 00:58:04,564
Aye.

997
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:08,985
Do you remember telling
the police anything else about that night?

998
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:11,696
Let me refresh your memory.

999
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,156
You told Inspector Dixon

1000
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:15,783
that you had committed a robbery on that night.

1001
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,661
Now do you remember?

1002
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:22,081
Aye.

1003

Who did you rob?

1004
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:27,295
Robbed a hooker.

1005
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,505
You robbed a prostitute?

1006
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:30,514
Aye.

1007
00:58:30,966 --> 00:58:32,675
And we are expected to believe a man

1008
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:34,844
who claims he stole from a prostitute

1009
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:37,513
before we would believe 10 police officers

1010
00:58:37,598 --> 00:58:40,474
who stood here on oath and called you a liar?

1011

It's the truth.

1012

You know, I mean...

1013
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:47,732
I'm bound to say I don't find you very convincing.

1014
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,817
Thank you, Mr. Conlon.

1015
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:57,950
Why didn't you tell me that you stole from that woman?

1016
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:02,955
You should've called me. I would've sent the money.

No.

They put a gun in my mouth

1026
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:53,297
and made me confess to a murder I didn't commit.

1027
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,884
So I said I did the big bombing

1028
00:59:57,344 --> 01:00:00,471
and named anybody I knew who was not in the IRA.

1029
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,848
DEFENSE COUNSEL: Not in the IRA?

1030
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:04,517
Definitely not in the IRA.

1031
01:00:04,977 --> 01:00:05,977
Why?

1032
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:08,813
You know why.

Well, I just wanted to show how ridiculous it all was.

1034
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:20,408
HAGGERTY: Inspector,
the defendant Conlon presented an alibi.

1035
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:22,159
One Charlie Burke.

1036
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:24,704
Yes, sir, that name did appear in Mr. Conlon's statement.

1037
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:26,289
We investigated it.

1038
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:28,040
We couldn't find any trace of such a person.

1039
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:31,585
And then there was this question
of the robbery of a prostitute.

1040
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:34,630
No robberies were reported in that area that night.

1041
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:38,509
At the start of this trial, I shook Gerry Conlon's hand.

1042
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,220
Subsequently, I was deeply shocked

1043
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:42,805
when a member of the legal profession came to me

1044
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:45,224
and asked me if I was now going to wash my hand.

1045
01:00:47,019 --> 01:00:49,645
In my long legal career, I cannot remember a case

1046
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:51,772
where emotions have been so charged.

1047
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:55,026
It falls to me now to appeal to you

1048
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:56,360
the members of the jury,

1049
01:00:56,445 --> 01:00:59,864
not to get caught up in this tide of mass hysteria.

1050
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:05,578
Inspector Dixon admits there are scores
of inconsistencies in the confessions.

1051
01:01:05,954 --> 01:01:09,206
My clients contend that they were forced to confess

1052
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:12,209
through brutality and intimidation.

1053
01:01:14,129 --> 01:01:15,755
Now, they may be foolish,

1054

I would caution you not to be swayed by your emotions.

Now, here are the facts of this case...

1069
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:11,977
Inspector Dixon,

1070
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:14,438
a decorated officer of great expertise,

1071
01:02:14,523 --> 01:02:17,942
acting on reliable information and good detective work,

1072
01:02:18,026 --> 01:02:19,819
arrested Paul Hill.

1073
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:24,407
Who, guilt-ridden by the shame of his crime, confessed.

1074
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:29,412
That confession led the police to the ringleader, Conlon,

1075
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:31,622
and his terrorist family.

1076
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:36,544
His aunt, Annie Maguire, the experienced bomb maker

1077
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:39,672
who wore rubber gloves when handling explosives

1078
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:42,383
in the kitchen of her home in Harlesden.

1079
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:44,927
She even allowed her children to handle explosives.

Gerry's a bad boy!

1296

1297
01:19:42,403 --> 01:19:45,989
Yes, sir. Go on, boy. Kick out them clods, yes?

1298
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:50,076
This is Joe McAndrew.
He has something important to tell you.

1299
01:19:50,369 --> 01:19:51,494
Hello, Mr. Conlon.

1300
01:19:54,165 --> 01:19:55,790
I'm watching you.

1301
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:08,761
What is it?

1302
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:13,224
I'm the one who planted the Guildford bomb, Mr. Conlon.

1303
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:18,480
Did you tell the police that?

1304
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:19,898
Yes, I did.

1305
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:22,692
But we haven't heard a thing.

1306
01:20:22,776 --> 01:20:24,736
Will you just wait and see what he has to say, Da?

Go on.

1308
01:20:28,282 --> 01:20:31,075
I told them. They know... They know the truth.

1309
01:20:32,745 --> 01:20:34,913
They can't afford to face it.

1310
01:20:35,414 --> 01:20:38,666
It's a war. You're one if its innocent victims.

1311
01:20:38,751 --> 01:20:40,835
I'm sorry for your trouble.

1312

Don't be sorry for us.

1313
01:20:43,797 --> 01:20:45,340
You should be sorry for the people you killed.

1314
01:20:47,218 --> 01:20:50,094
It was a military target, a soldiers' pub.

1315
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:54,641
They were innocent people, God's children.

We don't need your help.

What was that all about? You mind your fucking manners.

1323
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:21,084
What? Manners to him?

1324
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:23,169
I don't want any part of him, or his ways.

1325
01:21:23,254 --> 01:21:24,712
At least he stands up for himself. At least he fights back,

1326
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:25,964
which is more than you ever did in your life.

1327

What are you talking about?

1328

- Do you remember Lydon Hill?
- Huh?

1329
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:32,303
You used to ride me up on the crossbar
of your bike up Lydon Hill.

1330
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:34,264
And then one day you couldn't make it to the top,

1331
01:21:34,348 --> 01:21:36,933
and I hopped off the crossbar, and I looked back,

1332
01:21:37,017 --> 01:21:38,851
and your face was all red.

1333

- Remember that?
- Aye.

1334
01:21:43,691 --> 01:21:46,276
It was working in the paint shed done that to you.

1335
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:47,402
What?

1336
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:51,114
It was the fumes from working
in the paint shed done that to you.

1337

Never mind jumping off the ferry
and swimming back to Mummy.

It was the one job a Catholic can get,

1339
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:57,161
and you wouldn't even fight back then.

Joe explained things to me.

He explained how the Brits
never left anywhere without a fight.

How they had to be beaten
out of every country they ever occupied.

He told us to take our socks out of the window.

He thought we were signaling to other prisoners.

We're not signaling. We're drying our socks out.

01:39:00,810 --> 01:39:03,186
Every detail you can think of, and I need you to write it down.

1613
01:39:03,271 --> 01:39:05,188
It's really important.

1614
01:39:09,777 --> 01:39:11,028
(SIGHS)

1615
01:39:11,571 --> 01:39:13,196
I can't do this.

1616
01:39:15,867 --> 01:39:17,242
I can't write this, Da.

1617
01:39:17,619 --> 01:39:19,119
Could your son not give you a hand?

1618
01:39:19,203 --> 01:39:22,205
Nah. He's up in his cell writing away.

1619
01:39:27,629 --> 01:39:28,712
Okay.

1620
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:35,844
Tape recorder.

1621
01:39:35,928 --> 01:39:38,221
You're... You're a good talker.

1622
01:39:38,806 --> 01:39:39,890
Talk.

1623
01:39:41,601 --> 01:39:43,477
GERRY: The strange thing is...

1624
01:39:44,896 --> 01:39:46,980
The strange thing is sometimes I think he's a little jealous

1625
01:39:47,065 --> 01:39:49,733
of me taking over the campaign and that there.

1626
01:39:49,817 --> 01:39:52,569
Going up and down the stairs to meet you.

1627
01:39:53,529 --> 01:39:56,156
That's something I never thought about Guiseppe,

1628
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,241
that he could be jealous.

1629
01:39:59,911 --> 01:40:03,163
Anyhow, the main thing is to get the case reopened

1630
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:07,417
because I don't know how long he can survive in here.

1631
01:40:24,602 --> 01:40:25,977
I'm tired of this.

1632
01:40:26,854 --> 01:40:28,480
Come on. We have to do this. Come on.

1633
01:40:28,731 --> 01:40:30,065
You behave yourself.

1634
01:40:34,445 --> 01:40:35,570
Get your head down.

1635
01:40:42,954 --> 01:40:46,164
When I was a wee lad, I used to wonder
what you were doing under the towel.

1636
01:40:46,249 --> 01:40:47,833
And one day when you and Ma were out,

1637
01:40:47,917 --> 01:40:49,668
I got a big bowl of boiling water,

1638
01:40:49,752 --> 01:40:53,088
whacked a big drop of Vicks
and then put the towel over my head.

1639
01:40:53,172 --> 01:40:54,798
And then I sat there trying to figure out
what it was all about

1640
01:40:54,882 --> 01:40:57,134
'cause nothing was happening.

1641
01:40:57,218 --> 01:40:59,177
And then I figured you must've been drinking it.
Do you remember that?

1642
01:40:59,262 --> 01:41:01,138
So I stuck my tongue in it. Do you remember that?

1643
01:41:01,222 --> 01:41:02,639
(INHALES DEEPLY)

1644
01:41:02,974 --> 01:41:04,391
(COUGHS)

1645
01:41:04,475 --> 01:41:06,226
How could I forget?

1646
01:41:07,228 --> 01:41:10,447
And your tongue swelled up like a football.

1647
01:41:11,315 --> 01:41:13,275
Had to rush you to the hospital.

1648
01:41:13,359 --> 01:41:15,569
First time you'd stopped talking in your life.

1649
01:41:15,862 --> 01:41:17,279
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

1650
01:41:18,823 --> 01:41:19,823
Give us that.

1651
01:41:19,907 --> 01:41:21,158
(COUGHING)

1652
01:41:21,826 --> 01:41:24,119
I'll do your chest for you, Da.

1653
01:41:31,961 --> 01:41:33,336
Was I always bad, was I?

1654
01:41:34,839 --> 01:41:36,089
Not always.

1655
01:41:36,591 --> 01:41:38,967
I don't deserve to spend the rest of my life in here, do I?

1656
01:41:40,011 --> 01:41:42,929
All they've done is block out the light.

1657
01:41:43,014 --> 01:41:44,473
They can't block out the light in here.

1658
01:41:45,349 --> 01:41:46,558
Listen.

1659
01:41:46,851 --> 01:41:48,351
Every night...

1660
01:41:48,478 --> 01:41:50,645
I take your mother's hand in mine.

1661
01:41:50,730 --> 01:41:53,440
We go out the front door, into Cyprus Street,

1662
01:41:55,151 --> 01:41:58,069
down to Falls Road, up the Antrim Road

1663
01:41:59,864 --> 01:42:01,364
to Cave Hill.

1664
01:42:01,908 --> 01:42:03,700
We look back down

1665
01:42:05,953 --> 01:42:07,788
on poor, troubled Belfast.

1666
01:42:11,292 --> 01:42:14,127
I've been doing that every night

1667
01:42:14,212 --> 01:42:15,921
for five years now.

1668
01:42:17,882 --> 01:42:20,175
As if I never left your mother.

1669
01:42:30,102 --> 01:42:32,687
What I remember most about my childhood is,

1670
01:42:32,772 --> 01:42:34,439
holding your hand.

1671
01:42:34,982 --> 01:42:37,192
My wee hand in your big hand.

1672
01:42:37,443 --> 01:42:40,153
And the smell of tobacco. I remember that...

1673
01:42:40,238 --> 01:42:43,532
I could smell the tobacco off the palm of your hand.

1674
01:42:46,744 --> 01:42:50,831
When I want to feel happy,
I try to remember the smell of tobacco.

1675
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:55,794
Hold my hand.

1676
01:42:56,337 --> 01:42:58,547
(LAUGHS) Get the fuck...

1677
01:42:59,131 --> 01:43:01,716
Now, don't go sentimental on me now.

1678
01:43:02,718 --> 01:43:06,346
Don't be upset, Da. Look, I'll hold your hand if you like.

1679
01:43:08,808 --> 01:43:10,433
I'm going to die.

1680
01:43:11,853 --> 01:43:13,645
Don't be saying that.

1681
01:43:14,647 --> 01:43:16,022
I'm scared.

1682
01:43:18,192 --> 01:43:19,359
You've no reason to be scared.

1683
01:43:19,443 --> 01:43:20,652
You have nothing to be scared about.

1684
01:43:20,736 --> 01:43:25,282
Don't you be comforting me
when I can see the truth staring me in the face.

1685
01:43:25,366 --> 01:43:28,785
I'm scared I'm gonna die here among strangers.

1686
01:43:28,953 --> 01:43:30,370
You're not fucking dying, all right.

1687
01:43:31,414 --> 01:43:35,125
Can I not say a thing without you fucking contradicting me?

1688
01:43:36,002 --> 01:43:40,088
I'm scared to leave your mother behind.

1689
01:43:42,675 --> 01:43:45,677
Look, you are not going to die, all right, Da?

1690
01:43:48,472 --> 01:43:51,766
Even if you do, sure I can look after Ma all right.

1691
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:55,103
You think I'd leave Sarah in your care?

1692
01:43:56,647 --> 01:43:58,273
What do you mean?

1693
01:43:58,816 --> 01:44:02,319
You haven't the maturity to take care of yourself,
let alone your mother.

1694
01:44:09,744 --> 01:44:11,828
I haven't much time between appointments, Mrs. Peirce.

1695
01:44:12,622 --> 01:44:14,581
- How can I help you?
- Thank you.

1696
01:44:14,665 --> 01:44:17,959
I'm the solicitor for the Conlons, Chief Inspector.

1697
01:44:18,169 --> 01:44:21,671
Guiseppe Conlon is critically ill, as you may know.

1698
01:44:22,048 --> 01:44:24,424
I've petitioned before the court for his compassionate parole.

1699
01:44:24,508 --> 01:44:26,509
They want your clearance.

1700
01:44:27,219 --> 01:44:28,929
That'll be difficult, Mrs. Peirce.

1701
01:44:29,013 --> 01:44:31,973
These people have committed horrific crimes.

1702
01:44:33,059 --> 01:44:34,768
Society demands that they serve their time.

1703
01:44:36,020 --> 01:44:38,355
But they didn't do it, Chief Inspector.

1704
01:44:38,606 --> 01:44:39,856
Says who?

1705
01:44:40,650 --> 01:44:42,400
Say the real bombers.

1706
01:44:42,693 --> 01:44:44,986
They told you they did it, Mr. Dixon.

1707
01:44:46,030 --> 01:44:47,822
Gerry Conlon told me he did it, Mrs. Peirce.

1708
01:44:47,907 --> 01:44:49,824
These people are liars.

1709
01:44:50,576 --> 01:44:52,953
They're liars for a cause. That's the worst kind.

1710
01:44:53,371 --> 01:44:55,330
But he's dying. Guiseppe's dying.

1711
01:44:55,414 --> 01:44:58,291
A lot of people are dying. It's a dirty war.

1712
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:04,923
Well, I'll see what I can do.

1713
01:45:05,549 --> 01:45:07,092
Is this your family, Mr. Dixon?

1714
01:45:08,511 --> 01:45:10,178
That's my wife and my son.

1715
01:45:10,888 --> 01:45:12,973
You have another appointment.

1716
01:45:13,057 --> 01:45:14,140
Yes.

1717
01:45:16,185 --> 01:45:18,395
I'll see you again, Mr. Dixon.

1718
01:45:25,569 --> 01:45:26,861
(SNORING)

1719
01:45:54,890 --> 01:45:56,766
Are you all right, Da?

1720
01:46:03,899 --> 01:46:04,941
Da?

1721
01:46:10,156 --> 01:46:11,823
Are you all right?

1722
01:46:15,161 --> 01:46:16,786
Wake up, Da. Da?

1723
01:46:17,413 --> 01:46:20,457
Da, can you hear me? Can you hear me, Guiseppe?

1724
01:46:22,168 --> 01:46:23,877
Come on, dear God in heaven, don't do this to me.

1725
01:46:23,961 --> 01:46:25,545
Come on. Wake up.

1726
01:46:25,629 --> 01:46:26,880
Wake up! Fuck's sake, come on!

1727
01:46:26,964 --> 01:46:28,173
Come on, come on, wake up!

1728
01:46:28,257 --> 01:46:29,215
There you go. Thank you, God.

I'm going to get some help, all right?

01:47:17,181 --> 01:47:18,640
Look, I want to go with him. Please, can I go with him?

1755
01:47:18,724 --> 01:47:20,308
Boss, I'd like to go with him.

I've got to get clearance first. It's out of my hands.

You're gonna be all right, Da!

I'll be with you as soon as I can.

He's still awake.
