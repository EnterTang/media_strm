and can win a championship completed

126
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:12,810
something different thing you know what
I've learnt

127
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,759
when you can never listen to say

128
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:20,280
doing take place

129
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,639
for a collaboration

130
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,250
whenever there's a groom everyone has to
be

131
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,500
saying reach

132
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,820
go have an opportunity to play with them

133
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,680
guys wanting I mean

134
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,909
in the coach that was like

135
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:47,990
this here all that was needed for

136
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:52,060
whenever you get opportune be apartheid

137
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,620
your aim to

138
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,300
mmm charger you're basically

139
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,029
in a position where Gover

140
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:07,149
governor something home if which is

141
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:12,149
move in the movement was trying to win a
championship

142
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:15,399
it took a lot it took a lot of a lotta
me

143
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,270
and everybody was on the same page
and/or

144
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:22,740
so when I think back to all the critics
in america

145
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,900
what they say you know why I came to
China

146
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,149
what I'm doing in China I mean is so
type of people

147
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:34,079
or even here speaking about something

148
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:37,790
like you're talking about something you
don't even know what you're talking

149
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,630
about going off

150
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:43,569
experiences 56 years ago

151
00:09:43,569 --> 00:09:47,889
which is Connor to me is ninth

152
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:53,000
because now something brand new going on
in the present you're still talking

153
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,589
about

154
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:57,250
well known in the past to try to pull me
down so

155
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,279
I was is giving I was giving thanks to
God for

156
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:03,560
allow my mind to stay focused and at

157
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,940
do what was just died and

158
