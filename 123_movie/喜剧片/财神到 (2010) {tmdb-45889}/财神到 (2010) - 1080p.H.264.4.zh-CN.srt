...and I had an infection,
which turned into a fever...

739
00:59:43,632 --> 00:59:47,159
...which turned into inflammation
of my brain and spinal cord.

740
00:59:47,335 --> 00:59:49,269
It's called encephalomyelitis.

741
00:59:49,437 --> 00:59:53,965
And they had to operate,
in the back, here.

742
00:59:54,142 --> 00:59:59,910
It was a complicated procedure. It was
eight hours. And they nearly lost me.

743
01:00:00,082 --> 01:00:03,916
Actually, technically, they did lose me...

744
01:00:04,086 --> 01:00:07,078
...and bring me back
on a number of occasions.

745

Anyway, they cured the illness...

746
01:00:10,359 --> 01:00:15,194
...but they must've messed up something
else while they were back there, because...

...not long after,
I started to have these migraines.

And then nightmares.

749
01:00:20,903 --> 01:00:26,000
And then these connections.

750
01:00:27,743 --> 01:00:32,476
And one day I'm sitting with a friend,
and I had a vision of a woman...

751
01:00:32,648 --> 01:00:34,309
...a crystal-clear vision.

752
01:00:34,483 --> 01:00:36,951
And I described her to him.

753
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:42,318
And turned out it was an exact description
of his mother, someone I'd never met...

...who'd died the previous week.

Well, anyway, I assumed
it was some kind of a coincidence.

758
01:00:57,173 --> 01:01:02,509
But as time went on, I began having more
and more of these things, connections.

759
01:01:03,714 --> 01:01:06,877
So the doctors ran a bunch of tests.

760
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:10,747
They told my parents that I'd developed
something called passive schizophrenia.

761
01:01:10,921 --> 01:01:15,051
They gave me a bunch of pills and,
you know, the pills stopped the visions...

762
01:01:15,225 --> 01:01:18,217
...but they pretty much
stopped everything else also...

763
01:01:18,395 --> 01:01:20,056
...so I had this choice.

764
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:24,223
I was either gonna live my life
with these hallucinations...

765
01:01:24,401 --> 01:01:26,801
...with apparently no way
of switching it off.

at the time of his death.

Older brother.

1407
01:52:13,497 --> 01:52:15,795
But not by much, he says.

1408
01:52:17,534 --> 01:52:19,627
Only by a few minutes.

1409
01:52:22,372 --> 01:52:24,169
I'm sorry, kid.

1410
01:52:27,377 --> 01:52:31,939
I gotta concentrate.
This guy.... This guy talks a lot.

1411
01:52:32,115 --> 01:52:34,049
Talks fast.

1412
01:52:34,217 --> 01:52:36,447
Got a really weird laugh.

1413
01:52:37,387 --> 01:52:40,083
Okay. Ahem. He says...

1414
01:52:40,757 --> 01:52:43,487
...there's so much he wants to tell you.

1415
01:52:44,828 --> 01:52:46,921
You wouldn't believe how it is.

1416
01:52:47,397 --> 01:52:49,865
How you can be all things...

1417
01:52:51,168 --> 01:52:52,931
...and all at once.

1418
01:52:54,938 --> 01:52:56,701
And the weightlessness.

1419
01:52:57,174 --> 01:52:59,233
He says that's cool.

1420
01:53:00,243 --> 01:53:01,767
Now he's laughing.

1421
01:53:03,647 --> 01:53:05,410
He's got a funny laugh.

1422
01:53:05,682 --> 01:53:07,206
Um....

1423
01:53:08,085 --> 01:53:09,518
Okay.

1424
01:53:12,757 --> 01:53:16,022
He says how you
always looked up to him...

1425
01:53:16,661 --> 01:53:20,495
...and relied on him
to make the decision...

1426
01:53:21,199 --> 01:53:23,895
...how maybe you used that
as an excuse.

1427
01:53:25,069 --> 01:53:26,696
Is that true?

1428
01:53:27,672 --> 01:53:30,470
Okay. He says can't do that anymore.

1429
01:53:33,044 --> 01:53:34,705
Now you're on your own.

1430
01:53:36,614 --> 01:53:40,311
Okay, now, hang on, okay, now.
Now he's saying something about a hat.

1431
01:53:41,185 --> 01:53:42,812
The cap?

1432
01:53:42,987 --> 01:53:45,285
A cap. Okay.

1433
01:53:48,392 --> 01:53:52,260
He says to take it off right now.
Take it off.

1434
01:53:54,465 --> 01:53:57,263
He doesn't--
He's telling you not to wear it again...

1435
01:53:58,769 --> 01:54:00,760
...because it was his.

1436
01:54:02,106 --> 01:54:05,405
And that's why he knocked it off
your head that day?

1437
01:54:07,111 --> 01:54:10,137
At the tube? Do you know
what he's talking about?

1438
01:54:12,184 --> 01:54:13,617
Okay.

1439
01:54:14,486 --> 01:54:18,149
He says good thing he did too.

1440
01:54:24,229 --> 01:54:27,357
And that's the last time
he's ever looking out for you.

1441
01:54:29,234 --> 01:54:30,667
I'm sorry. I'm, uh....

1442
01:54:34,773 --> 01:54:39,107
I'm sorry, I'm losing him now.
He's leaving. He wants to leave.

1443
01:54:43,749 --> 01:54:45,273
No, Jase.

1444
01:54:46,351 --> 01:54:47,545
Don't go.

1445
01:54:48,487 --> 01:54:51,354
You can't. Don't leave me.

1446
01:54:51,523 --> 01:54:53,616
I don't wanna be here without you.

1447

Please, Jase, don't go. I miss you.

1448
01:54:57,663 --> 01:55:01,360
Okay, he came back. He's here. He says...

1449
01:55:03,568 --> 01:55:07,834
...if you're worried about being
on your own, don't be.

1450
01:55:08,675 --> 01:55:09,903
You're not.

1451
01:55:10,176 --> 01:55:14,237

1458
01:55:33,599 --> 01:55:37,433
Okay, wait. He's leaving again.
Hold on, hold on. I'm sorry.

1459
01:55:37,603 --> 01:55:38,900
Well, where's he gone?

I'm sorry, kid. I don't know.

But you've done all those readings.

Well, I rang up the publisher

01:57:10,265 --> 01:57:13,632
...wanted to drop off a letter
