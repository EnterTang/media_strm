00:01:04,534 --> 00:01:07,471
Bohus ! Are you there ?

3
00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:11,236
Get up. You lazy-bones !

4
00:01:26,025 --> 00:01:30,385
That goat'll strangle herself one day !

5
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,549
You've knocked it over again !

6
00:01:38,587 --> 00:01:40,534
Let me unwind you. Go over there !

7
00:01:45,924 --> 00:01:46,878
Go over there !

8
00:01:50,525 --> 00:01:54,447
Those are Bohus's pancakes !

9
00:01:57,105 --> 00:02:00,634
Go on. Take one then !

10
00:02:01,462 --> 00:02:03,209
They'll be all muddy !

11
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:10,782
Chick, chick ! If it weren't for me.
You'd have nothing !

12
00:02:12,843 --> 00:02:15,382
Chick, chick !

13
00:02:17,007 --> 00:02:20,729
Bohus, Bohus !

14
00:02:21,723 --> 00:02:25,724
Why don't you answer me ?
- Stop fussing.

15
00:02:25,961 --> 00:02:28,224
I've got pancakes for you.

16
00:02:29,532 --> 00:02:32,899
The pig's got out again.

17
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:37,854
He's getting his exercise.

18
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:43,251
D'you know 2.750 pubs
were opened this month ?

19
00:02:44,282 --> 00:02:47,413
That means more rascals. - Oh, come on !

20
00:02:48,283 --> 00:02:53,194
What's that doing in here ?
Come on. Out you go !

21
00:02:58,632 --> 00:03:01,485
I'm looking for an older woman,

22
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:07,751
I'm 70. A widower, businessman.

23
00:03:09,376 --> 00:03:13,929
That's something for you.
- I've finished with all that.

24
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,080
But you should marry
and stop all that whoring.

25
00:03:20,554 --> 00:03:22,491
Finished ?

26
00:03:23,132 --> 00:03:25,663
You've never been a whore.

27
00:03:29,116 --> 00:03:34,192
You just laze about.
You don't work on the house.

28
00:03:34,383 --> 00:03:38,990
The roof's got holes in it
and you just lie there.

29
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,979
If you at least did something
to help -

30
00:03:44,616 --> 00:03:49,968
Feed the hens or the rabbits...

31
00:03:51,991 --> 00:03:56,943
You just lie about idle and do nothing.

32
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:48,326
That pig's a real swine !
- Bohus. Are you at home ?

33
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:54,470
What d'you want ?

34
00:04:57,324 --> 00:04:59,663
You didn't show up.
- What was it like ?

35
00:05:00,295 --> 00:05:02,439
We waited for you until four
in the morning.

36
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:07,632
Vlasta didn't come either.
The pub's shut.

37
00:05:08,661 --> 00:05:10,009
So what ?

38
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:13,930
She'll open up now. eh ?
- Where was she, then ?

39
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:17,978
And who with ? - Eh. Bohus ? !
- Leave it out !

40
00:05:23,608 --> 00:05:25,545
Stop shouting !

41
00:05:37,557 --> 00:05:40,098
Bohus !

42
00:05:42,235 --> 00:05:44,891
Are you here ?

43
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,230
Stop hiding. I know where you are !

44
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,233
D'you want that gas or not ?

45
00:05:56,473 --> 00:05:59,201
What for ?
- Hergot ! !

46
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:03,410
We fought for it under communism
and now no-one wants it !

47
00:06:05,744 --> 00:06:08,762
I'll withdraw the application !

48
00:06:09,112 --> 00:06:13,358
I'll do without since you've
done nothing about it.

49
00:06:13,795 --> 00:06:15,338
I'm cancelling the application !

50
00:06:15,774 --> 00:06:19,737
You think you'll get a girl here
without gas !

51
00:06:20,971 --> 00:06:23,305
I'm cancelling the application !

52
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:36,473
I'm opening up in a minute !

53
00:06:36,983 --> 00:06:40,826
Stop that. You idiot !

54
00:06:43,846 --> 00:06:48,201
We did it yesterday,
and the day before !

55
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:55,382
I'll be five minutes !
- More like seven.

56
00:06:56,014 --> 00:06:58,949
God knows what they'll think !
- You're sitting on some bacon.

57
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:07,112
I'll do it - I'll cut myself !

58
00:07:07,752 --> 00:07:10,725
You're too high. - Stand on your toes.

59
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,079
Open up ! What's she doing in there ?

60
00:07:17,894 --> 00:07:21,858
Just can't do without it, can you ?

61
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,826
I'm glad I'm not your wife !
- I'm single.

62
00:07:26,064 --> 00:07:30,422
If I were as young as I'm single,
I'd be a teenager.

63
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,668
We're queuing in the rain like
Russians buying bread !

64
00:07:43,786 --> 00:07:48,141
Christ, I've got washing hanging
outside !

65
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,358
It's not raining, idiot !

66
00:07:51,754 --> 00:07:57,300
It's bit damp, though !
Forget your knickers and get serving !

67
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:01,858
Put the telly on.

68
00:08:23,232 --> 00:08:25,764
Have a fucking rest !

69
00:08:29,014 --> 00:08:32,740
There were 2 metres here
yesterday - where's the other one ?

70
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,716
Who d'you mean ?

71
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:39,524
Have you seen another one here ?

72
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:44,085
Have some brandy.

73
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:51,654
You'll have to get out
of the habit of doing that.

74
00:08:52,091 --> 00:08:56,051
You mean, you'll have to.

75
00:08:56,889 --> 00:09:01,010
I'd like to see you or Bohus.

76
00:09:03,272 --> 00:09:07,196
...with three kids
coming to see you !

77
00:09:08,821 --> 00:09:10,798
You'd be in the Party too.

78
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,779
They're all trying to be clever now.

79
00:09:15,403 --> 00:09:18,773
I am and always will be a Communist !

80
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:21,423
I joined the Party
and I had no children.

81
00:09:21,586 --> 00:09:27,335
I'd rather see them peg out
than join the Party.

82
00:09:27,572 --> 00:09:30,105
You can talk, you haven't got any.

83
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:36,485
As a Communist it bugs me
that you left the Party. - Cut it out !

84
00:09:38,514 --> 00:09:40,654
Just be glad it's behind us now.

85
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:43,426
Is it fuck !

86
00:09:52,072 --> 00:09:55,004
Good morning. - Gutten Tag !

87
00:09:58,812 --> 00:10:00,754
Good morning.

88
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:07,529
Two years after the Revolution
and Krauts everywhere !

89
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:47,172
Lovely fresh air...

90
00:10:48,206 --> 00:10:51,142
...peace and quiet.

91
00:10:52,013 --> 00:10:54,947
Birds twittering sweetly,

92
00:10:55,024 --> 00:11:03,192
What an arsehole.

93
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:04,898
Christ !

94
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:09,053
Don't try hide from me !

95
00:11:09,927 --> 00:11:13,850
There's no-one here, only a pisshead !

96
00:11:14,288 --> 00:11:18,255
Just wait till I get home !

97
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:22,023
You drunken oaf !

98
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:32,365
The good thing about marriage is

99
00:11:32,604 --> 00:11:36,171
you can have a fuck
even when you don't want to !

100
00:11:36,408 --> 00:11:38,831
Look at our sexy number !

101
00:11:38,985 --> 00:11:42,955
She's really something !

102
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:48,302
She knows a thing or two !

103
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,884
I could do with a drink.

104
00:11:51,154 --> 00:11:54,605
And I'm starving and I've got
no-one to sleep with !

105
00:11:58,692 --> 00:12:01,466
Lend me thirty, or twenty.

106
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:05,229
Why should I lend you money ?

107
00:12:05,394 --> 00:12:07,806
Young lads and they haven't got
any money.

108
00:12:08,206 --> 00:12:11,533
Shut up and play.
- The game's not going your way.

109
00:12:11,654 --> 00:12:14,590
Look at clever young Vanek.

110
00:12:14,826 --> 00:12:17,796
He sells those lotteries.

111
00:12:18,231 --> 00:12:22,158
I've won nothing all year.
- I'm not surprised. - Here you are.

112
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,548
Give us three beers. Hello !

113
00:12:29,774 --> 00:12:32,106
Four beers and four vodkas.

114
00:12:33,143 --> 00:12:35,716
You're drunk,

115
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,490
you haven't got any money. Go home.

116
00:12:40,716 --> 00:12:43,091
Give us some. For fuck's sake !

117
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:47,846
Where'd get money from ?
We've co from work !

118
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:51,815
Don't be such a cow

119
00:12:52,884 --> 00:12:54,826
and give us four beers.

120
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,596
Give them the beers on me.
- They're not getting anything.

121
00:12:58,431 --> 00:13:00,173
Go home !

122
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:05,369
Wake up. She'll give you some.

123
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,364
You'll give him some, eh ?
- Keep your insults to yourself !

124
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,500
Who d'you think I am ?

125
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:22,894
I'm declaring a protest sleep.

126
00:13:23,528 --> 00:13:26,298
Today's youth can't manage anything.

127
00:13:27,336 --> 00:13:29,869
Good afternoon.

128
00:13:30,508 --> 00:13:33,238
I'm looking for Mr. Stejskal.

129
00:13:33,716 --> 00:13:36,846
Is he here ?

130
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:41,013
They've come for you !

131
00:13:41,484 --> 00:13:45,408
Are you Bohumil Stejskal ?
Good afternoon.

132
00:13:50,644 --> 00:13:53,177
Could you step outside for a moment ?

133
00:13:54,605 --> 00:13:56,947
Me ?

134
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,345
Why ?

135
00:14:10,344 --> 00:14:13,475
Be on the alert, lads.

136
00:14:19,302 --> 00:14:22,440
What has he done ?
Where are they taking him ?

137
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:28,221
Must be the secret police.
- You should know. - Leave it out.

138
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:33,778
Rubbish. They've been disbanded.

139
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:46,147
The police have now issued
information concerning

140
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:50,105
the crimes committed by a teenage gang.

141
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,077
He's gone off his head,
the poor bugger !

142
00:15:07,514 --> 00:15:11,437
Damages amounted to 375.000 crowns...

143
00:15:12,072 --> 00:15:14,014
Yeah, me ! Me ! Me !

144
00:15:20,037 --> 00:15:22,379
Sergeant, have any further
arrests been made ?

145
00:15:23,014 --> 00:15:26,182
How is the investigation progressing ?

146
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:32,721
We have discovered more details
about the crime.

147
00:15:33,004 --> 00:15:35,937
It's quite clear...

148
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:44,899
I'm rich ! Stop the car !

149
00:15:45,923 --> 00:15:47,865
I'm rich !

150
00:15:48,302 --> 00:15:50,682
To your health ! Cheers !

151
00:15:51,716 --> 00:15:55,442
Cheers !

152
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:59,644
I don't have to answer
to anyone anymore !

153
00:15:59,883 --> 00:16:01,826
What are you going on about ?

154
00:16:01,945 --> 00:16:05,591
I'll pay you back.
I've got money, haven't I ?

155
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:09,788
Have a drink.
- I can't, they'd lock me up.

156
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:12,168
What d'you mean, you can't ?

157
00:16:13,202 --> 00:16:16,172
I'll pay for everything.
I've got money.

158
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:20,339
I'll pay you out of prison.

159
00:16:20,494 --> 00:16:22,322
I'll bring him over.

160
00:16:22,553 --> 00:16:26,524
Come on, come with me.

161
00:16:28,942 --> 00:16:32,466
He won't believe me otherwise.
Give me some money !

162
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:36,469
I'd love to help you out
but there's no point now.

163
00:16:36,711 --> 00:16:39,447
Am I rich or am I not ?

164
00:16:39,678 --> 00:16:43,649
Of course, but it has
to be sorted out legally.

165
00:16:46,855 --> 00:16:49,591
More formalities !

166
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:56,572
I'll pay you back.

167
00:16:57,644 --> 00:16:59,976
I'm getting it all back.

168
00:17:02,793 --> 00:17:04,935
Come to Vlasta's tonight.

169
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:12,701
And they won't take it from me again ?

170
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:17,506
No. In all probability.
I don't think so.

171
00:17:19,324 --> 00:17:21,463
You don't think so ?

172
00:17:21,904 --> 00:17:25,468
I don't believe it !

173
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:28,836
I mean, definitely not.

174
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,250
Only if the system changes.

175
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,395
You mean the Commies will be back ?

176
00:17:40,452 --> 00:17:43,586
I'm easy... You're easy, eh ?

177
00:17:44,423 --> 00:17:46,953
We're easy.

178
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:52,346
How much does it come to ?

179
00:17:52,585 --> 00:17:54,929
How much ! ? How much ! ?

180
00:17:56,587 --> 00:17:58,140
It depends.

181
00:17:59,364 --> 00:18:02,895
D'you mean the market value
or the book value ?

182
00:18:04,521 --> 00:18:08,288
All this is making my arse sweat.
Market fluctuations affect the value.

183
00:18:09,913 --> 00:18:12,842
Just give me some idea.

184
00:18:17,288 --> 00:18:19,938
You're either lucking stupid
or you won't tell me.

185
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:27,000
It's upward of six figures.

186
00:18:29,214 --> 00:18:32,189
More than six figures ?

187
00:18:33,219 --> 00:18:35,642
Then I'm a millionaire !

188
00:18:36,192 --> 00:18:39,131
I'm a millionaire !

189
00:18:39,805 --> 00:18:43,529
Stop the car, I'm a millionaire !

190
00:18:46,544 --> 00:18:50,105
I've got to get out of the car !

191
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,858
God, I knew you were up there somewhere.

192
00:19:01,483 --> 00:19:04,027
Don't pretend you aren't.

193
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,346
Teacher !

194
00:19:22,813 --> 00:19:24,952
I'm rich !

195
00:19:25,983 --> 00:19:29,913
They gave it all back to me ! Kids.

196
00:19:30,786 --> 00:19:34,310
I'm a millionaire -
I can buy you what you want.

197
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,883
Say hello, children. - Good afternoon.

198
00:19:38,115 --> 00:19:40,776
Hello, kids. Let's go.

199
00:19:40,932 --> 00:19:42,990
Let's go, doc !

200
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,017
We're here.

201
00:19:58,451 --> 00:20:02,575
That's mine, too ?
- Only up to that fence.

202
00:20:02,813 --> 00:20:05,790
We can buy it, can't we ?

203
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,557
It's nice...

204
00:20:10,979 --> 00:20:12,326
And a church.

205
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:16,607
That's not part of it.
- I know. I'm not stupid.

206
00:20:17,644 --> 00:20:19,818
How many bricks are made here ?

207
00:20:20,538 --> 00:20:22,679
I'll look it up for you.

208
00:20:28,307 --> 00:20:30,646
These haven't been in the kiln yet.

209
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:36,634
What're you standing around here
for smoking ?

210
00:20:36,826 --> 00:20:38,611
You have to get a move on.

211
00:20:39,086 --> 00:20:42,098
Who d'you think you are,
the President's brother ?

212
00:20:45,432 --> 00:20:49,194
Don't talk to me like that,
you old fart !

213
00:20:49,635 --> 00:20:53,559
Who are you calling a fart ? !
- You shit.

214
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,567
You're fired !

215
00:20:59,582 --> 00:21:01,721
Get me the manager !

216
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,516
Why didn't you ram him one ? !

217
00:21:07,751 --> 00:21:09,894
Manager !

218
00:21:10,325 --> 00:21:13,458
What's going on ?
- I want the manager.

219
00:21:13,935 --> 00:21:15,083
I am the manager.

220
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,856
You've got some real rabble
working here.

221
00:21:18,096 --> 00:21:22,144
I'm Dr. Ulrich. - Good day, comrade...

222
00:21:22,383 --> 00:21:25,432
May I present the new owner
of this brickworks.

223
00:21:25,865 --> 00:21:27,810
Mr. Bohumil Stejskal.

224
00:21:28,442 --> 00:21:32,412
Glad to meet you.
I've been working here 25 years.

225
00:21:33,438 --> 00:21:36,375
And look at the mess everywhere !

226
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,755
Bricks lying around -

227
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:43,346
25 years and it looks like this !

228
00:21:43,981 --> 00:21:46,560
The chimney's the only thing
smoking around here !

229
00:21:46,803 --> 00:21:50,325
Come on, boys. - Don't pander to them.

230
00:21:52,942 --> 00:21:55,682
Get to work, gentlemen !
- These are our bricks ! - Of course.

231
00:22:01,464 --> 00:22:05,073
I've got a brickworks ! Fantastic !

232
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,663
The value of bricks has gone up.

233
00:22:06,901 --> 00:22:09,115
I'll expand.

234
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:12,413
See that big house over there ?

235
00:22:14,469 --> 00:22:18,000
That big one ? - Yes, it's yours.

236
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,163
I don't believe it !

237
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,567
And that block over there.

238
00:22:26,404 --> 00:22:28,939
With all those shops ?

239
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,346
That ? ! - Yes !

240
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:38,334
And that food shop ?
- Of course, let's go.

241
00:22:41,346 --> 00:22:43,887
Good afternoon.

242
00:22:48,131 --> 00:22:50,463
Give me a bottle of plum brandy.

243
00:22:54,512 --> 00:22:56,451
You going to give it to me ?

244
00:22:57,086 --> 00:22:59,345
Get into the queue.

245
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,005
She won't give it to me !

246
00:23:03,069 --> 00:23:05,413
I'll take it myself, then. - Wait !

247
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,365
There we are !
- That'll be 56 crowns.

248
00:23:10,483 --> 00:23:13,971
What do you mean ?

249
00:23:14,605 --> 00:23:18,730
You pay for that brandy !

250
00:23:18,969 --> 00:23:21,107
You can't drink that !
It's not paid for !

251
00:23:21,391 --> 00:23:23,928
Sir, tell him not to drink that !
It's not paid for !

252
00:23:24,164 --> 00:23:26,505
Why should I ?

253
00:23:26,663 --> 00:23:30,270
I'm sorry about this.
- Don't pay anything in my shop !

254
00:23:32,529 --> 00:23:36,257
Why are you giving her money ?
In my shop ? !

255
00:23:36,535 --> 00:23:39,461
It hasn't been legally settled yet.

256
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:44,815
So, she doesn't know yet !
Will she be surprised !

257
00:23:46,682 --> 00:23:48,817
Tell her it's mine.

258
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:50,807
Excuse me.

259
00:23:54,449 --> 00:23:58,570
Mr. Bohumil Stejskal here is
the new owner of the shop.

260
00:24:00,678 --> 00:24:04,560
You're getting pay from me
for the last time.

261
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:09,518
What d'you do with what you don't sell ?

262
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,916
It goes bad otherwise, eh ? - No.

263
00:24:14,154 --> 00:24:16,094
You throw that salami out ?

264
00:24:18,315 --> 00:24:22,078
No. It gets sold off.

265
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,644
Only buy what you sell.
You're a good-Iooking bird.

266
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:30,647
You couldn't work here
if you did stupid things.

267
00:24:38,451 --> 00:24:41,585
Wait, wait, stop ! Stop ! - What now ?

268
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,555
It's Kaja, my old mate !

269
00:24:46,817 --> 00:24:51,144
Hello, Kaja !
I know you ! You don't know me ?

270
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:54,707
I don't remember you, sorry.

271
00:24:55,185 --> 00:24:58,315
Let's go and get smashed.

272
00:24:58,557 --> 00:25:01,647
I'm in a real hurry. I am sorry !

273
00:25:01,843 --> 00:25:04,616
I've got a taxi.

274
00:25:04,935 --> 00:25:07,471
I'm sorry, but... - Take a photo...

275
00:25:08,223 --> 00:25:10,054
Let's go for that drink.

276
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,346
Have a nice time. I have to go.

277
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:16,435
Come on. Kaja. This is all mine !

278
00:25:17,461 --> 00:25:19,410
Off we go.

279
00:25:21,464 --> 00:25:25,394
I'll find you... in Prague.

280
00:25:26,222 --> 00:25:28,170
Or on television.
- We haven't got time.

281
00:25:28,442 --> 00:25:32,366
We can go by taxi.

282
00:25:33,403 --> 00:25:36,729
He didn't stop to chat.

283
00:25:36,892 --> 00:25:39,345
They're all watching.

284
00:25:39,787 --> 00:25:43,469
Bit of an idiot, eh ?
- Of course, he is.

285
00:25:44,338 --> 00:25:48,548
Could've had a drink. - Get in, please.
- Where's that brandy ?

286
00:25:50,721 --> 00:25:52,824
It's shame. - We don't need him.

287
00:25:55,682 --> 00:25:57,269
Let's go.

288
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,442
Let's go.

289
00:25:59,685 --> 00:26:02,500
He could've come with us.

290
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:11,025
That's mine, too ? - Of course !

291
00:26:12,056 --> 00:26:16,375
Part of this block and this hotel.

292
00:26:17,203 --> 00:26:21,173
Let's go for an inspection. - What ? !

293
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:26,127
Let's go for an inspection.
- I'll just get my papers.

294
00:26:29,182 --> 00:26:30,924
Wait, wait !

295
00:26:34,296 --> 00:26:36,075
Good afternoon.

296
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,074
Don't say anything.

297
00:26:46,343 --> 00:26:48,409
Don't say it's mine.

298
00:26:56,058 --> 00:26:59,980
We've been here 5 minutes and no service !

299
00:27:06,526 --> 00:27:09,730
I'm sorry, gentlemen, but...
- What's up ? - We're reserved.

300
00:27:12,981 --> 00:27:16,912
I'm sorry, but you'll have to go
somewhere else.

301
00:27:17,105 --> 00:27:19,011
Got some problems ?

302
00:27:19,685 --> 00:27:23,211
Let's go and sort it out.

303
00:27:26,935 --> 00:27:28,884
What'll it be ?

304
00:27:31,303 --> 00:27:33,835
Two soda waters. - And what else ?

305
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,837
What else ? Nothing else. Two soda waters.

306
00:27:38,675 --> 00:27:40,810
Can you remove your cigarette ?

307
00:27:42,006 --> 00:27:43,112
What d'you mean ?

308
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:46,804
You might like to remove your cigarette !

309
00:27:52,942 --> 00:27:57,150
I don't believe it !
This table-cloth needs changing.

310
00:27:58,419 --> 00:28:01,310
Waiter... - Quiet !

311
00:28:10,548 --> 00:28:11,693
You're here already ? !

312
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:16,967
You can sit here, madam.

313
00:28:17,684 --> 00:28:20,144
The gentlemen are just leaving.

314
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:25,607
Repete !

315
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:28,786
I'm sorry ? - We want some more !

316
00:28:30,647 --> 00:28:34,375
I think I'll have an ice-cream sundae.

317
00:28:34,606 --> 00:28:36,589
No ! Just two sodas.

318
00:28:37,185 --> 00:28:40,679
Two soda waters.
- Only with a coffee order.

319
00:28:43,606 --> 00:28:45,555
Two coffees, then.

320
00:28:47,213 --> 00:28:51,026
You'll spoil it !
Let the idiot get on with it !

321
00:28:51,693 --> 00:28:53,682
Who are you calling an idiot ?

322
00:28:55,545 --> 00:28:58,076
I'd like two sugars.

323
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,487
Is that yours ?

324
00:29:07,948 --> 00:29:11,640
What would you like ? - A whisky.

325
00:29:15,441 --> 00:29:16,794
Where are you from ?

326
00:29:16,945 --> 00:29:20,198
Prague, and this is my cousin
from Africa.

327
00:29:20,317 --> 00:29:24,240
A Praguer ! That's the capital.

328
00:29:24,953 --> 00:29:28,884
It must be really smokey there
everyone's black !

329
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:31,219
No offence, boys.

330
00:29:50,886 --> 00:29:53,265
We ordered something and they didn't.

331
00:29:55,836 --> 00:30:00,199
I ordered coffee so I could get a soda
and I get nothing !

332
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:05,075
They got their drinks
so who's the idiot ?

333
00:30:05,231 --> 00:30:08,171
Who d'you think you are ? !

334
00:30:08,645 --> 00:30:11,182
This is a five-star hotel !

335
00:30:11,262 --> 00:30:15,855
Mr. Five-Star should behave better.

336
00:30:20,182 --> 00:30:22,318
People trying to flag you down,

337
00:30:22,438 --> 00:30:25,892
people want to pay and take no notice.

338
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,106
The table-cloths are dirty...

339
00:30:28,269 --> 00:30:31,079
It's a real mess here !

340
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,048
You waddle from one table to the next.

341
00:30:38,096 --> 00:30:39,842
You let in blacks and not gipsies.

342
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:43,606
You know how much money gipsies have ?

343
00:30:44,084 --> 00:30:46,507
I'm not racist, don't get me wrong.

344
00:30:49,237 --> 00:30:53,596
You think you're so clever !

345
00:30:54,634 --> 00:30:57,364
You think I'm some kind of idiot ?

346
00:30:57,602 --> 00:31:00,182
Tell him who I am !

347
00:31:02,521 --> 00:31:03,943
Unfortunately,

348
00:31:04,146 --> 00:31:07,711
this is the new owner, the heir.

349
00:31:10,565 --> 00:31:12,909
Unfortunately for him, you mean.

350
00:31:13,935 --> 00:31:19,483
I don't give a damn, you're an oaf !

351
00:31:19,646 --> 00:31:22,854
I won't be ordered about by anyone !

352
00:31:23,211 --> 00:31:26,817
You try rushing around all day !

353
00:31:26,978 --> 00:31:29,636
Let the owner try it !

354
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:32,135
You think I've never worked ?

355
00:31:32,845 --> 00:31:36,810
I doubt it from the way you behave.

356
00:31:37,838 --> 00:31:40,778
You just don't knowthe terrain.

357
00:31:41,134 --> 00:31:43,790
I can leave anytime.

358
00:31:44,339 --> 00:31:47,949
Off you run, then.

359
00:31:48,185 --> 00:31:50,412
I don't need people like you !

360
00:31:51,798 --> 00:31:53,460
It's the new age !

361
00:31:53,576 --> 00:31:56,710
The guest throws the waiter out !

362
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,685
I'm leaving !

363
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:02,423
I'm leaving !

364
00:32:02,736 --> 00:32:04,682
It's new age !

365
00:32:06,428 --> 00:32:09,678
Off he goes.
- You shouldn't have done that.

366
00:32:09,914 --> 00:32:12,057
Why ?

367
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:14,673
I'm rich, aren't I ?

368
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:28,106
Look at him pacing out the land.

369
00:32:33,423 --> 00:32:34,534
Have a drink.

370
00:32:35,202 --> 00:32:38,538
Tell him all this...

371
00:32:41,549 --> 00:32:43,685
Strong stuff, eh ?

372
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:47,096
Tell him all this is mine !

373
00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:52,769
That I'm a millionaire.

374
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:00,457
If they need any apples
or pears in Africa.

375
00:33:03,673 --> 00:33:06,602
We'll send them over.

376
00:33:13,028 --> 00:33:15,363
Why is he laughing ?

377
00:33:16,635 --> 00:33:20,356
I am Bohumil Stejskal.

378
00:33:22,384 --> 00:33:26,151
What's this... Ahoso vidaho... ?

379
00:33:27,776 --> 00:33:29,519
The son of the Highest.

380
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:34,278
There's only one...

381
00:33:35,425 --> 00:33:37,409
The king's son !

382
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:41,255
I just thought...don't worry.

383
00:33:43,113 --> 00:33:45,259
But you've no phone. - No. He hasn't.

384
00:33:45,451 --> 00:33:47,397
We can fax stuff instead.

385
00:33:47,557 --> 00:33:51,082
Your land starts at the stream

386
00:33:51,285 --> 00:33:53,221
and finishes at the woods.

387
00:33:53,663 --> 00:33:58,182
Over there you've got 20m...
- Stop telling me what I own !

388
00:33:58,656 --> 00:34:00,403
I've got quite enough already.

389
00:34:00,641 --> 00:34:03,567
Have a drink. - No thank you.

390
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:06,344
Have a drink,
or I'll use someone else's services.

391
00:34:08,014 --> 00:34:11,739
To the son of the highest !

392
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:15,110
Sit down.

393
00:34:20,539 --> 00:34:22,085
Have a drink.

394
00:34:24,148 --> 00:34:25,893
Lie down.

395
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:32,038
We're living in a democracy !

396
00:34:32,829 --> 00:34:34,971
It's fucking hot !

397
00:34:41,987 --> 00:34:43,931
Hey. Slav !

398
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:49,994
Do you want some help ?
- No. Off you go.

399
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,958
Are you all right ?

400
00:34:54,117 --> 00:34:56,931
I might be sick over you !

401
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:01,929
Off you go !

402
00:35:04,742 --> 00:35:06,288
I'll go with you !

403
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,291
Go on ! - Bye !

404
00:35:11,918 --> 00:35:13,266
Get going !

405
00:35:14,931 --> 00:35:17,469
My dear lord !

406
00:35:18,302 --> 00:35:20,838
You're still in your shoes !

407
00:35:22,266 --> 00:35:25,396
Dirty, horrid...

408
00:35:25,675 --> 00:35:27,972
You don't know what happened.

409
00:35:29,242 --> 00:35:31,382
I'm a millionaire.

410
00:35:31,501 --> 00:35:34,396
You stupid millionaire,

411
00:35:34,474 --> 00:35:36,773
your goat's strangled herself ! - What ?

412
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:40,143
She's hanged herself ! - What ?

413
00:35:43,791 --> 00:35:47,715
I can't be here all the time.

414
00:35:50,371 --> 00:35:51,721
Your goat !

415
00:35:57,547 --> 00:36:00,681
I told you not to tie her to that tree.

416
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:22,126
How did it happen ?

417
00:36:22,204 --> 00:36:26,367
She fell and got caught on the rope.

418
00:36:32,393 --> 00:36:34,931
Lizinka, what have you done to me ?

419
00:36:36,556 --> 00:36:38,697
I've got all this money.

420
00:36:41,552 --> 00:36:43,494
My little goat.

421
00:36:44,842 --> 00:36:47,181
I had all these plans for you !

422
00:36:48,094 --> 00:36:50,235
A new goat-shed.

423
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:53,802
What's the point of money now ?

424
00:36:55,268 --> 00:36:57,409
You won't come back to life.

425
00:36:58,478 --> 00:37:02,405
You're sorry now but you can't help her.

426
00:37:05,416 --> 00:37:07,398
You won't come back,

427
00:37:08,907 --> 00:37:11,164
not even for a million !

428
00:37:13,385 --> 00:37:15,764
You shouldn't have done that to me !

429
00:37:17,389 --> 00:37:20,045
I won't pray for ten days.

430
00:37:20,561 --> 00:37:24,724
Don't blaspheme,
you're always in the pub.

431
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,282
So your farm's going into ruin.

432
00:37:30,512 --> 00:37:33,681
I'm inviting you all. - Bohus !

433
00:37:34,715 --> 00:37:38,043
It's a funeral wake.
- What's happened ?

434
00:37:38,481 --> 00:37:41,255
In memory of my goat.

435
00:37:41,768 --> 00:37:43,434
She hanged herself, the swine.

436
00:37:44,268 --> 00:37:46,210
To goats !

437
00:37:46,447 --> 00:37:48,074
Don't eat that !

438
00:37:48,271 --> 00:37:50,768
I'm inviting you.

439
00:37:54,931 --> 00:37:56,637
Don't give them that shit.

440
00:37:56,795 --> 00:38:00,362
Get changed.
In front of the pub in an hour.

441
00:38:01,393 --> 00:38:04,922
I'll pay for these beers.
- No, I'm paying !

442
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:10,907
Liduna won't let me go.

443
00:38:11,143 --> 00:38:12,891
She'll have to.

444
00:38:13,128 --> 00:38:15,864
Jackets, ties, we're going into town.

445
00:38:15,943 --> 00:38:19,074
Don't drink that pig swill.

446
00:38:21,295 --> 00:38:24,070
Me, too ? - Of course.

447
00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:28,510
Forget the cards, we're off to town.

448
00:38:28,668 --> 00:38:32,038
But I'm winning ! - So what ?

449
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:35,012
I'm inviting you all.

450
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:38,856
I've just been to a cremation.
I don't need to change.

451
00:38:39,014 --> 00:38:41,393
OK, stay as you are. Let's go.

452
00:38:42,226 --> 00:38:45,753
Just finish my rum. - Leave that.

453
00:38:48,014 --> 00:38:49,362
What about me ?

454
00:38:49,481 --> 00:38:52,255
Sorry, no girls allowed.

455
00:39:00,936 --> 00:39:03,871
Come right back home. - No, I won't.

456
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:08,074
You not coming, Josef ?

457
00:39:10,688 --> 00:39:14,297
He's giving you money.
- It'll all be paid for.

458
00:39:16,476 --> 00:39:19,530
Arnost, come with us.

459
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:22,186
Where to ? - To celebrate !

460
00:39:23,655 --> 00:39:25,793
You thick, or something ?

461
00:39:26,032 --> 00:39:28,967
Great nose, great spirit.

462
00:39:31,224 --> 00:39:35,150
He didn't mean it like that, come on.

463
00:39:39,471 --> 00:39:41,731
The double decker is here !

464
00:39:45,538 --> 00:39:48,668
Isn't that fucking fantastic ?

465
00:39:53,702 --> 00:39:54,853
OK. On you get.

466
00:39:58,699 --> 00:40:02,621
If you get on that bus,
don't come back again !

467
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:06,032
You promised to chop the wood.

468
00:40:06,268 --> 00:40:10,195
Just be good, here's a thousand.

469
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,898
Bohus !

470
00:40:12,018 --> 00:40:15,188
I said, no girls !

471
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:17,568
For the journey.

472
00:40:18,994 --> 00:40:22,762
They'll be fighting over me next !

473
00:40:42,503 --> 00:40:44,447
There's old Kostal.

474
00:40:44,643 --> 00:40:47,460
Stop the bus.

475
00:40:50,472 --> 00:40:52,811
Come and have dinner with us.

476
00:40:52,971 --> 00:40:56,181
I stopped having dinner since
the invasion of Kuwait.

477
00:40:56,458 --> 00:41:00,382
Get him in. - What are you doing ?
- Let's go.

478
00:41:10,096 --> 00:41:12,989
I have to feed my rabbits.

479
00:41:14,376 --> 00:41:16,717
You'll make me sterile !

480
00:41:16,994 --> 00:41:20,284
You're making it dirty,
you know how much this costs ?

481
00:41:20,364 --> 00:41:22,266
So what...

482
00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:25,675
These guys have a really hard life.

483
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:31,266
They need some fun, put the TV on.

484
00:41:34,436 --> 00:41:36,617
Faster, here we go...

485
00:41:36,737 --> 00:41:40,224
Look, boys, go at 120km/h.

486
00:41:46,726 --> 00:41:49,184
...eighty...

487
00:41:51,206 --> 00:41:53,228
...ninety, hundred...

488
00:41:55,885 --> 00:41:58,699
...a hundred and twenty !

489
00:42:00,878 --> 00:42:04,724
Ninety...
I said 120, do what I tell you !

490
00:42:04,804 --> 00:42:14,873
Hello ! - Hello.

491
00:42:25,061 --> 00:42:27,400
I'm Bohus.

492
00:42:30,056 --> 00:42:33,188
We agreed no girls !

493
00:42:36,994 --> 00:42:40,164
Let me introduce you to my wife.

494
00:42:41,789 --> 00:42:44,052
Dr. Ulrich.

495
00:42:45,677 --> 00:42:47,500
Doctor ?

496
00:42:47,974 --> 00:42:49,996
Are you a lawyer as well ?

497
00:42:50,353 --> 00:42:53,367
No, a plastic surgeon.

498
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:56,893
What ? - A plastic surgeon.

499
00:42:57,132 --> 00:43:00,661
Say, someone wants to make
their nose smaller.

500
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,833
Sorry.

501
00:43:04,902 --> 00:43:08,827
You can't be a man
without a proper nose.

502
00:43:11,246 --> 00:43:14,376
Arnost's got a problem with his nose.

503
00:43:14,853 --> 00:43:17,985
They laugh at his, it's so small.

504
00:43:18,619 --> 00:43:20,164
I don't get any ?

505
00:43:24,487 --> 00:43:27,737
To the memory of my little goat.

506
00:43:29,284 --> 00:43:32,139
To a little goats !

507
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:37,094
What shit is this ?

508
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:41,891
It's fucking sweet !

509
00:43:42,722 --> 00:43:46,686
I've drunk all my money away...

510
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:57,034
Please be quiet.
- That's what we're doing.

511
00:43:58,065 --> 00:44:00,483
You can't shout in a restaurant
like this.

512
00:44:00,641 --> 00:44:01,791
It's alright.

513
00:44:02,425 --> 00:44:06,588
What sort of pub is this
if you can't have a sing-song ?

514
00:44:09,402 --> 00:44:12,931
It's not even in Czech !

515
00:44:13,606 --> 00:44:17,530
I'd recommend the ham roll,

516
00:44:20,186 --> 00:44:23,119
then the turtle soup.

517
00:44:23,556 --> 00:44:25,378
I'm not downing turtle !

518
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:28,273
Then the Chateaubriand.

519
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,485
I've have that, too.

520
00:44:31,722 --> 00:44:34,021
But medium rare.

521
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:39,016
I want goulash and dumplings.

522
00:44:39,373 --> 00:44:42,030
I'll have the medium rare, too.

523
00:44:42,465 --> 00:44:45,001
Bring me a beer before I snuff it.

524
00:44:51,226 --> 00:44:53,565
What about your venison ?

525
00:44:53,922 --> 00:44:55,585
We'll have goulash and beer.

526
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:59,353
Goulash and beer for me.

527
00:45:00,385 --> 00:45:02,128
Beer and rum.

528
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:06,489
But these are specialities !

529
00:45:07,362 --> 00:45:09,820
Just bring the food and don't ask.

530
00:45:11,047 --> 00:45:13,148
They're dick-heads.

531
00:45:13,742 --> 00:45:16,677
Don't act like peasants !

532
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:20,643
Could I have caviar ? - Of course.

533
00:45:21,117 --> 00:45:24,646
What an arse-hole - caviar !

534
00:45:25,677 --> 00:45:28,253
Sit down, Arnost !

535
00:45:29,483 --> 00:45:31,623
Look at these portions !

536
00:45:34,637 --> 00:45:36,380
Sparrow food.

537
00:45:36,657 --> 00:45:39,989
I'm going for a slash.

538
00:45:45,101 --> 00:45:48,155
Get a load of that !
She's something else !

539
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:55,925
Bohus will buy her for you, eh ?

540
00:45:56,757 --> 00:45:58,699
Stop shouting.

541
00:45:59,532 --> 00:46:02,663
What would you like to drink ?
- Beer.

542
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:06,706
You're always downing beer.

543
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:10,038
What about the best wine they've got ?

544
00:46:12,099 --> 00:46:16,023
I'd like to try that blue burgundy.

545
00:46:17,054 --> 00:46:20,266
I've never tried blue wine.

546
00:46:21,056 --> 00:46:23,396
Some of that blue stuff.

547
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:27,956
Come here, come here !

548
00:46:29,264 --> 00:46:32,516
What does that girl like drinking ?

549
00:46:32,989 --> 00:46:34,934
Scotch.

550
00:46:36,717 --> 00:46:39,413
Send a bottle over there.

551
00:46:39,572 --> 00:46:41,474
Certainly.

552
00:46:50,114 --> 00:46:53,407
Have some, it's good stuff.

553
00:46:53,643 --> 00:46:54,833
Christ !

554
00:46:54,992 --> 00:46:58,324
Have some - it'll clean out your system !

555
00:46:59,353 --> 00:47:03,039
Perhaps it'll really clean you out !

556
00:47:06,646 --> 00:47:08,788
Cheers !

557
00:47:10,056 --> 00:47:11,802
Cheers !

558
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,735
To your health, my beauty !
- To your health ! - Cheers !

559
00:47:27,579 --> 00:47:29,126
What a looker !

560
00:47:29,561 --> 00:47:33,565
You have to drink it all
or we're not going home.

561
00:47:34,992 --> 00:47:37,132
Must be an actress.

562
00:47:38,204 --> 00:47:40,663
Or a whore.

563
00:47:41,693 --> 00:47:43,476
Or both.

564
00:47:43,675 --> 00:47:46,925
Don't insult her !

565
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:51,405
Don't be a clever dick !
- Who's being clever ?

566
00:47:51,643 --> 00:47:55,170
He thinks money can make him president !

567
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:59,177
Don't fuck with me or you'll be sorry,

568
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,157
you old fart !

569
00:48:01,434 --> 00:48:05,081
Try me, you capitalist !

570
00:48:05,994 --> 00:48:08,532
Who are you calling a capitalist,
you shit !

571
00:48:08,768 --> 00:48:12,099
I could pretend to be clever
if I had money, too.

572
00:48:19,552 --> 00:48:21,494
Leave him alone !

573
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:51,346
Fuck this town !

574
00:48:52,536 --> 00:48:54,992
Let's go home, come on !

575
00:49:03,556 --> 00:49:06,014
You're not leaving me here !

576
00:49:08,114 --> 00:49:09,860
My leg...

577
00:49:10,929 --> 00:49:12,989
It'll be OK.

578
00:49:18,579 --> 00:49:22,306
You'll pay for the damage.
- We'll settle up, of course.

579
00:49:26,985 --> 00:49:28,610
Are they gone ?

580
00:49:28,889 --> 00:49:31,782
Have they really gone ?

581
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:34,755
Bastards !

582
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,521
We'll pay up, you pay them,

583
00:49:48,155 --> 00:49:50,731
You're the only normal person
around here.

584
00:49:54,141 --> 00:49:56,083
You know what ?

585
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,452
I'll pay for you to have a nose-job.

586
00:50:00,126 --> 00:50:01,237
Really !

587
00:50:01,672 --> 00:50:05,518
You'll do it for him,
no matter how much it costs.

588
00:50:05,677 --> 00:50:08,572
Do you believe me ? - What ?

589
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:10,831
I don't care how much.

590
00:50:12,456 --> 00:50:16,262
Doctor, are you a doctor ?

591
00:50:16,739 --> 00:50:17,847
Yes.

592
00:50:21,177 --> 00:50:23,753
D'you believe in God ?

593
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:26,967
Me ? No.

594
00:50:27,362 --> 00:50:29,938
I don't understand
how anyone can believe.

595
00:50:30,295 --> 00:50:32,239
Why not ?

596
00:50:33,744 --> 00:50:35,568
There's no proof,

597
00:50:35,965 --> 00:50:37,708
no-one's ever seen Him.

598
00:50:38,501 --> 00:50:41,871
I've never seen your cunt
but I believe you've got one.

599
00:50:59,235 --> 00:51:01,693
Try a bit higher.

600
00:51:04,826 --> 00:51:06,172
OK.

601
00:51:07,797 --> 00:51:10,454
Look at them go !

602
00:51:11,206 --> 00:51:13,744
How fast can it go ?

603
00:51:15,291 --> 00:51:18,344
That left one could be our mayor.

604
00:51:20,166 --> 00:51:22,110
Who did you vote for ?

605
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:25,083
What a woman !

606
00:51:33,724 --> 00:51:35,391
OK !

607
00:51:38,681 --> 00:51:41,179
They're only Czech programs or what ?

608
00:51:41,297 --> 00:51:43,119
You're in the way !

609
00:51:43,239 --> 00:51:45,023
More to the left.

610
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:51,563
That's too much.

611
00:51:54,815 --> 00:51:56,876
What shall we have ?

612
00:51:58,581 --> 00:52:00,880
Plum brandy, eh ?

613
00:52:10,554 --> 00:52:12,496
To your health.

614
00:52:16,539 --> 00:52:19,869
D'you believe in God ?

615
00:52:20,385 --> 00:52:21,851
I do.

616
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:23,320
And I don't.

617
00:52:23,476 --> 00:52:27,005
How can you work together ?

618
00:52:28,273 --> 00:52:30,217
It's not possible.

619
00:52:30,931 --> 00:52:32,952
It's a sin not to believe.

620
00:52:33,072 --> 00:52:34,893
Want some rabbit ?

621
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,382
The devils are multiplying.

622
00:52:38,463 --> 00:52:42,228
I can't kill them all
and no-one wants to eat them.

623
00:52:42,427 --> 00:52:46,351
You can forget about meat.

624
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,543
It's money now !

625
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:56,302
You get hold of my neck
like that rabbit's.

626
00:53:28,215 --> 00:53:32,141
We've an appointment with Dr. Siroky.

627
00:53:34,478 --> 00:53:36,539
Phone for you !

628
00:53:36,818 --> 00:53:40,900
I've got a phone call !

629
00:53:41,139 --> 00:53:44,112
I'll go on up. - Yes, off you go.

630
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:46,094
I've got a phone call !

631
00:53:53,826 --> 00:53:56,838
Yes, this is me.

632
00:53:58,581 --> 00:54:01,039
Who's calling ?

633
00:54:01,675 --> 00:54:03,577
No, it's not raining.

634
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:07,065
You're trying what out ?

635
00:54:08,768 --> 00:54:11,704
He's trying it out to see if it works !

636
00:54:11,822 --> 00:54:15,947
I've got a meeting so piss off !

637
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,364
I can't have this !

638
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,266
Whose name shall I say ?

639
00:54:20,782 --> 00:54:22,922
Bohumil Stejskal.

640
00:54:23,992 --> 00:54:27,760
Mr. Stejskal's here...
You can go in.

641
00:54:33,786 --> 00:54:36,876
Do I have to knock ? - No. You don't.

642
00:54:41,913 --> 00:54:44,449
Good afternoon.

643
00:54:45,876 --> 00:54:49,840
May I introduce you...
Mr. Stejskal, Dr. Siroky.

644
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:52,219
Pleased to meet you.

645
00:54:52,338 --> 00:54:56,264
She doesn't smile much,
but she's pretty.

646
00:54:59,315 --> 00:55:01,971
Take a seat.

647
00:55:02,407 --> 00:55:04,152
Christ, yeah.

648
00:55:07,204 --> 00:55:08,949
What can I offer you ?

649
00:55:09,068 --> 00:55:12,913
Coffee, vodka, whisky.
- I'll have a coffee.

650
00:55:13,032 --> 00:55:16,719
I'll have plum brandy.

651
00:55:17,552 --> 00:55:22,072
That's the only thing I haven't got.

652
00:55:22,268 --> 00:55:26,036
I carry a hip-flask, just in case.

653
00:55:30,871 --> 00:55:35,351
Two coffees and a glass.

654
00:55:35,471 --> 00:55:38,998
Three glasses, you have to try it,
it's last year's.

655
00:55:39,275 --> 00:55:42,487
Three glasses, then.

656
00:55:42,844 --> 00:55:46,768
Just the bottom of the glass !

657
00:55:47,005 --> 00:55:49,226
Bottoms up, you mean !

658
00:55:50,614 --> 00:55:52,635
Isn't it lovely stuff ?

659
00:56:03,538 --> 00:56:08,215
It's good...strong...

660
00:56:11,704 --> 00:56:15,431
We've been negotiating

661
00:56:15,985 --> 00:56:18,760
with a Japanese firm.

662
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,742
Where can I have a slash ?

663
00:56:21,338 --> 00:56:24,471
A piss...pee.

664
00:56:25,302 --> 00:56:29,385
In the corridor, third door on the left.

665
00:56:36,402 --> 00:56:39,335
Christ, what the hell sort of person
is that ? !

666
00:56:40,407 --> 00:56:43,340
Clever to have bogs in the corridor.

667
00:56:47,344 --> 00:56:49,802
Come on, quickly.

668
00:56:53,329 --> 00:56:57,255
Where was I ? - At the Ministry.

669
00:57:01,576 --> 00:57:04,233
The Japanese are interested...

670
00:57:04,349 --> 00:57:06,887
Sit down !

671
00:57:09,266 --> 00:57:13,190
The Japanese are interested

672
00:57:13,626 --> 00:57:16,005
in your brickworks.

673
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:21,159
What interest ?
- They want to buy it.

674
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:25,639
And the 7 hectares of land with it.

675
00:57:25,797 --> 00:57:27,344
Eight.

676
00:57:28,177 --> 00:57:29,920
I've got seven down here.

677
00:57:30,159 --> 00:57:33,489
And I've got eight there.
- It doesn't matter.

678
00:57:33,646 --> 00:57:35,431
A minor detail,

679
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:39,077
a hectare here, a hectare there.

680
00:57:41,931 --> 00:57:43,875
Why would they spend money
on a brick-works ?

681
00:57:48,514 --> 00:57:51,090
I can sell my brick to them.

682
00:57:56,561 --> 00:58:00,208
How did the yellow buggers
find out about it anyway ?

683
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:04,251
That's not important.

684
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:09,762
It's not the bricks Japanese want.

685
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:13,289
Hang on a second.

686
00:58:13,369 --> 00:58:16,896
What about the men there ?
- What men ?

687
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:20,306
The men working there.

688
00:58:21,893 --> 00:58:23,994
That's not our worry.

689
00:58:24,152 --> 00:58:27,045
Yeah, but it's mine.

690
00:58:27,244 --> 00:58:30,099
It's my brickworks and my people.

691
00:58:35,016 --> 00:58:37,949
I'm just coming !

692
00:58:39,811 --> 00:58:42,905
Think about it,

693
00:58:43,181 --> 00:58:48,295
there are huge sums at stake !

694
00:58:48,454 --> 00:58:52,221
Tell the Japs that I'm not selling

695
00:58:52,378 --> 00:58:55,471
and they'll be lucky
to get any fucking bricks !

696
00:58:56,501 --> 00:58:58,126
Let's go, Doc.

697
00:59:04,788 --> 00:59:07,244
Slanty-eyed fuckers !

698
00:59:12,438 --> 00:59:14,380
Good...

699
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:28,572
Come on, Mr. Kostal.

700
00:59:28,771 --> 00:59:30,556
I don't think this is for me.

701
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:34,202
Really, I can't.

702
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:36,541
You can be my sex bodyguard.

703
00:59:37,413 --> 00:59:39,672
What if I catch something ?

704
00:59:39,831 --> 00:59:43,639
The ladies are waiting.
- Come on, off you go.

705
00:59:45,541 --> 00:59:48,197
You can have a bark inside.

706
00:59:52,081 --> 00:59:53,628
Good evening.

707
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:08,056
That one's smiling at you.

708
01:00:08,217 --> 01:00:12,141
She could be my granddaughter.

709
01:00:35,887 --> 01:00:39,018
If you'd like to choose
what you'd like.

710
01:00:43,856 --> 01:00:46,195
"Indian Pipe".

711
01:00:46,313 --> 01:00:48,177
That's something for Kostal.

712
01:00:48,614 --> 01:00:52,577
I've hadn't smoked since
the Russians invaded.

713
01:00:56,382 --> 01:01:00,110
It's a special oral erotic experience.

714
01:01:00,664 --> 01:01:03,121
What d'you mean, oral ?

715
01:01:05,699 --> 01:01:08,672
Don't stick your little tongue
out at me.

716
01:01:10,931 --> 01:01:14,063
She a pretty little thing.

717
01:01:15,333 --> 01:01:18,862
How much does she cost ?
- Champagne for the gentlemen.

718
01:01:20,487 --> 01:01:24,014
This is a massage salon,
you can't buy the girls.

719
01:01:24,251 --> 01:01:28,018
You choose what you would like
and the girl

720
01:01:29,643 --> 01:01:33,530
whom you'd like to perform it.

721
01:01:35,036 --> 01:01:37,532
If she's not reserved already.

722
01:01:38,007 --> 01:01:41,099
It stinks like a brothel in here !

723
01:01:49,347 --> 01:01:52,914
I'd recommend Journey round the World.

724
01:01:53,945 --> 01:01:57,869
I can't, I'm driving.
He hasn't got a licence.

725
01:01:59,733 --> 01:02:03,063
How much does it cost ?

726
01:02:03,697 --> 01:02:05,956
And how many times ?

727
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:08,811
To your health, gentlemen.

728
01:02:10,675 --> 01:02:15,233
It's an hour's massage
with bath and everything.

729
01:02:16,025 --> 01:02:19,989
I don't need a bath.

730
01:02:20,148 --> 01:02:22,646
I had one on Saturday.

731
01:02:22,806 --> 01:02:25,777
You'll be bathed by one of our girls.

732
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:30,735
The champagne is on the house.

733
01:02:30,972 --> 01:02:34,103
Rubbish, don't you know
how rich I am ?

734
01:02:34,302 --> 01:02:36,721
Look !

735
01:03:00,467 --> 01:03:02,210
Good evening !

736
01:03:05,619 --> 01:03:08,000
D'you remember me ?

737
01:03:08,434 --> 01:03:11,844
I sent that bottle over. - So what ?

738
01:03:12,081 --> 01:03:15,532
Nothing, it's OK.

739
01:03:32,221 --> 01:03:36,065
Wish me luck,
I'm going for Amadeus's Dream !

740
01:03:38,166 --> 01:03:40,625
Come in.

741
01:03:41,498 --> 01:03:45,422
If you'd like to take your clothes off.

742
01:03:45,619 --> 01:03:48,197
I'll just go and get ready.

743
01:03:48,434 --> 01:03:52,201
What's your name ? - Irena.

744
01:04:36,561 --> 01:04:39,773
That's me done. - Already ?

745
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:43,181
I'll bathe you first.

746
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:47,306
Don't worry, come on.
- I'm not worried.

747
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:51,112
Come on, don't worry.

748
01:04:52,974 --> 01:04:55,909
Look at all those bubbles !

749
01:05:01,697 --> 01:05:05,579
Take your clothes off !

750
01:05:06,137 --> 01:05:08,713
And your underpants !

751
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:17,791
My watch is Water-tight.

752
01:05:27,425 --> 01:05:29,842
This is so nice !

753
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:38,722
You don't remember

754
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:42,726
how I fought the boys over you ?

755
01:05:42,965 --> 01:05:46,889
They were arguing

756
01:05:47,088 --> 01:05:50,297
whether you were an actress...

757
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:54,422
This is lovely !

758
01:05:57,393 --> 01:05:59,811
Are you really a masseuse ?

759
01:06:00,606 --> 01:06:04,570
This is bloody nice !

760
01:06:06,869 --> 01:06:10,438
Don't you remember me ?

761
01:06:12,023 --> 01:06:15,313
This is so nice ! - Up you get.

762
01:06:16,068 --> 01:06:19,992
I don't want to.

763
01:06:20,190 --> 01:06:24,155
You don't remember me ?
- Of course, I do.

764
01:06:25,501 --> 01:06:28,039
I fought over you.

765
01:06:28,159 --> 01:06:31,686
I'm Bohumil - Bohus.

766
01:06:38,702 --> 01:06:42,666
Out you come, careful you don't slip.

767
01:06:48,139 --> 01:06:50,358
I don't want that !

768
01:06:50,476 --> 01:06:53,610
He has to wear his little hat !

769
01:06:53,846 --> 01:06:56,583
I don't want a little hat.

770
01:06:58,447 --> 01:07:00,585
What is this ?

771
01:07:02,409 --> 01:07:04,947
You'll like it.

772
01:07:05,143 --> 01:07:09,110
I don't want it, I'll pay extra.

773
01:07:09,784 --> 01:07:12,757
It'll cost you 500 crowns.

774
01:07:12,914 --> 01:07:15,768
That doesn't matter.

775
01:07:16,126 --> 01:07:18,505
No little hat !

776
01:07:26,315 --> 01:07:29,844
You can't do that !

777
01:07:31,905 --> 01:07:35,829
This isn't Journey round the World.

778
01:07:39,476 --> 01:07:42,530
It's Journey to the Universe !

779
01:07:49,427 --> 01:07:51,369
Vlasta !

780
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:02,311
That was fantastic !

781
01:08:02,510 --> 01:08:06,275
Did you like that ?

782
01:08:07,346 --> 01:08:09,764
Another 500 crowns, then.

783
01:08:09,922 --> 01:08:13,094
"The Journey" costs 1700 !

784
01:08:13,331 --> 01:08:16,265
You pay that at the cash desk.

785
01:08:17,099 --> 01:08:19,792
I'll take the the 500.

786
01:08:21,261 --> 01:08:25,225
But don't tell anyone.

787
01:08:26,055 --> 01:08:29,189
They'd throw me out.
- What d'you mean ?

788
01:08:32,716 --> 01:08:35,890
A clever girl like you sweating

789
01:08:36,006 --> 01:08:38,862
for a few hundred.

790
01:08:41,201 --> 01:08:43,145
Such a shame !

791
01:08:47,188 --> 01:08:50,118
You can live with me.

792
01:08:56,148 --> 01:09:00,072
You can't keep being thrown out
by people.

793
01:09:17,037 --> 01:09:19,970
I'm completely whacked.

794
01:09:20,725 --> 01:09:23,697
I paid 7800 for you.

795
01:09:24,015 --> 01:09:26,948
I just had Journey round the World.

796
01:09:27,149 --> 01:09:29,801
You're a real stud -

797
01:09:30,002 --> 01:09:32,261
you must have been twice.

798
01:09:32,377 --> 01:09:35,908
Three times ! Three times

799
01:09:36,148 --> 01:09:38,487
plus Pipe of Peace.

800
01:09:39,953 --> 01:09:42,451
I feel like a new man !

801
01:09:45,899 --> 01:09:49,862
Can you drive ? - Just watch me !

802
01:09:52,599 --> 01:09:55,612
You've given me something

803
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:58,466
I'll never forget !

804
01:10:05,837 --> 01:10:08,493
I've fallen in love.

805
01:10:10,201 --> 01:10:13,569
That Irena's so pretty,

806
01:10:14,796 --> 01:10:16,739
it's a miracle !

807
01:10:18,761 --> 01:10:21,737
I have to have her home.

808
01:10:23,756 --> 01:10:27,167
Why ? You've got enough money.

809
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:30,854
You could come here whenever you want.

810
01:10:31,725 --> 01:10:35,652
The greatest thing is freedom,

811
01:10:36,087 --> 01:10:39,614
and you can't buy that.

812
01:10:42,073 --> 01:10:45,243
I want her only for myself.

813
01:10:53,809 --> 01:10:56,185
It's stopped coming out !

814
01:10:57,256 --> 01:10:59,238
It's not coming through ?

815
01:11:03,082 --> 01:11:05,542
The water's not coming through !

816
01:11:10,337 --> 01:11:12,201
What d'you mean ?

817
01:11:12,362 --> 01:11:14,500
It's not working !

818
01:11:15,532 --> 01:11:19,457
I don't believe it !
- It won't work, I tell you !

819
01:11:20,528 --> 01:11:24,453
We haven't had any water for a week
- low pressure.

820
01:11:27,466 --> 01:11:30,201
There's no pressure !

821
01:11:30,358 --> 01:11:33,532
I keep telling you.

822
01:11:33,649 --> 01:11:37,573
There's a drought, like last year.

823
01:11:38,051 --> 01:11:40,390
This is the end !

824
01:11:41,417 --> 01:11:43,362
She's coming in an hour !

825
01:11:46,413 --> 01:11:48,951
You're doing it on purpose.

826
01:11:49,983 --> 01:11:52,636
I've got an idea,

827
01:11:52,756 --> 01:11:56,720
for five hundred. - Five hundred ? !
- Will you give it to me or not ?

828
01:12:07,862 --> 01:12:10,042
Come on, guys !

829
01:12:24,234 --> 01:12:27,167
What the hell are you doing ?

830
01:12:29,229 --> 01:12:32,520
It's like water cannons
on Wenceslas Square !

831
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:35,136
Sorry, they're beginners.

832
01:12:35,375 --> 01:12:38,108
What are you doing ? !

833
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:41,479
What is this ?

834
01:12:45,957 --> 01:12:48,894
Cakes bobbing about like musk-rats !

835
01:12:51,506 --> 01:12:53,411
Aim it in the water !

836
01:12:54,125 --> 01:12:57,653
It's a bit yellow.

837
01:13:13,036 --> 01:13:15,770
There's no suckling-pig,
just rabbit again !

838
01:14:18,207 --> 01:14:21,104
Looks pretty yellow to me.

839
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:25,068
Like piss-water.
- I'm not swimming in that.

840
01:14:25,185 --> 01:14:27,645
Who's asking you to ?

841
01:14:27,724 --> 01:14:29,625
This is the limit !

842
01:14:30,497 --> 01:14:33,627
What d'you expect for 500 crowns ?

843
01:14:34,145 --> 01:14:37,435
The tank's been rusty
since the Revolution.

844
01:14:37,671 --> 01:14:41,599
If it catches fire,
you're in the shits.

845
01:14:41,837 --> 01:14:44,252
What d'you mean, you are - we are !

846
01:14:45,046 --> 01:14:47,466
Don't throw it in there.

847
01:14:47,625 --> 01:14:50,359
Quiet !

848
01:15:21,282 --> 01:15:24,413
Take that into the house.

849
01:15:28,854 --> 01:15:31,944
This is Irenka.

850
01:15:32,421 --> 01:15:36,386
It's her birthday
and she'll be living with me.

851
01:15:38,407 --> 01:15:41,144
What in heaven's name

852
01:15:41,381 --> 01:15:43,917
have you brought home ?

853
01:15:43,997 --> 01:15:47,207
If your Mum could see this...

854
01:15:47,364 --> 01:15:50,301
God in heaven !

855
01:15:51,328 --> 01:15:54,145
Don't take any notice of auntie.

856
01:15:54,345 --> 01:15:57,158
She's not my aunt,

857
01:15:57,318 --> 01:16:00,250
just a friend of Mum's.

858
01:16:00,411 --> 01:16:04,252
Go and help Mr. Kostal,
for Christ's sake !

859
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:12,024
I'll buy you some earrings,
come with me.

860
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:18,487
You bastard ! - Don't be so stupid !

861
01:16:18,645 --> 01:16:21,184
Let's go, Irena.

862
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:36,404
What do you do ?
- Stop kidding about.

863
01:16:38,625 --> 01:16:41,680
Irena's an actress.

864
01:16:42,114 --> 01:16:45,087
I did lots of parts as an amateur.

865
01:16:50,479 --> 01:16:53,451
You haven't eaten much.

866
01:16:53,886 --> 01:16:58,288
She's on a diet.

867
01:16:59,161 --> 01:17:03,087
I'm not on a diet, why should I be ?

868
01:17:03,243 --> 01:17:06,970
I eat everything - but no rabbits.

869
01:17:07,407 --> 01:17:10,618
You should've said.

870
01:17:11,015 --> 01:17:14,939
We'd have made you something else.
- There's nothing else.

871
01:17:15,059 --> 01:17:18,703
Be glad it's gone.

872
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:24,216
Don't do that, idiot !

873
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:27,466
This is my friend,

874
01:17:27,625 --> 01:17:31,506
he went to college.

875
01:17:31,907 --> 01:17:34,640
This is Irena, sit down.

876
01:17:36,703 --> 01:17:40,627
I had her brought here to live with me.

877
01:17:43,877 --> 01:17:46,296
What did she say ? - Nothing.

878
01:17:46,853 --> 01:17:50,578
She's got to...

879
01:17:53,394 --> 01:17:55,770
Down there.

880
01:17:59,777 --> 01:18:03,345
Past the chickens.

881
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:12,381
That's it.

882
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:18,447
What's the difference
between a woman and a man ?

883
01:18:19,519 --> 01:18:23,443
A man has to decide
on a no.1or a no. 2.

884
01:18:23,563 --> 01:18:25,622
A woman sits down and sees what happens.

885
01:18:29,667 --> 01:18:33,591
Here she is, quiet.

886
01:18:36,167 --> 01:18:40,051
I had a birthday present
brought here for her.

887
01:18:40,608 --> 01:18:44,572
Don't let it out yet.

888
01:18:45,604 --> 01:18:48,934
Go round the other side of the stable.

889
01:18:55,551 --> 01:18:58,207
It's here.

890
01:18:59,319 --> 01:19:02,055
Have you finished ?

891
01:19:07,091 --> 01:19:10,618
No, she hasn't yet.

892
01:19:12,837 --> 01:19:14,822
Tell me when you've finished.

893
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:19,023
When she opens the toilet,

894
01:19:20,926 --> 01:19:24,850
I'll give the sign,
Kostal will signal to the band.

895
01:19:25,444 --> 01:19:27,862
The band starts up

896
01:19:29,408 --> 01:19:31,353
and you let it out.

897
01:19:31,826 --> 01:19:35,788
Have you finished, Irenka ?

898
01:19:38,167 --> 01:19:41,224
This isn't a funeral, we're celebrating !

899
01:19:47,127 --> 01:19:49,270
Get ready...

900
01:20:04,252 --> 01:20:06,792
An ostrich ? !

901
01:20:11,233 --> 01:20:14,167
It's for your birthday !

902
01:20:15,989 --> 01:20:18,051
What do I want with an ostrich ?

903
01:20:18,207 --> 01:20:20,864
You've never seen a bird like this !

904
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:26,100
What would I do with an ostrich ? !

905
01:20:38,112 --> 01:20:40,689
Don't be afraid of him.

906
01:20:41,877 --> 01:20:45,364
Come and stroke him.

907
01:20:46,078 --> 01:20:50,002
Look at that neck and those legs !

908
01:20:59,002 --> 01:21:02,966
In South Africa they use them
to protect property.

909
01:21:05,782 --> 01:21:08,752
Why do you need a guard ?

910
01:21:08,993 --> 01:21:11,529
I've got a video,

911
01:21:11,649 --> 01:21:14,701
television.

912
01:21:16,564 --> 01:21:18,310
And Irena.

913
01:21:19,737 --> 01:21:23,661
What does it eat ?
- It won't eat you !

914
01:22:11,707 --> 01:22:14,644
Lovely and warm !

915
01:22:18,688 --> 01:22:20,627
Come into the water !

916
01:22:21,421 --> 01:22:23,603
I don't think I will.

917
01:22:23,837 --> 01:22:25,979
You're fired if you don't !

918
01:22:34,345 --> 01:22:36,567
Are you mad ? !

919
01:22:43,185 --> 01:22:47,109
Don't you dare, in that new jacket !
- Don't worry !

920
01:23:00,511 --> 01:23:02,451
This is fantastic !

921
01:23:34,364 --> 01:23:37,934
I'm so happy !

922
01:23:42,770 --> 01:23:45,663
Good, eh ?

923
01:23:47,685 --> 01:23:49,230
Yes, it's nice.

924
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:55,533
I'll take three of them.
- Pardon ?

925
01:23:55,653 --> 01:23:58,350
Three of these suits.

926
01:23:59,975 --> 01:24:03,185
You can't buy three identical suits !

927
01:24:03,421 --> 01:24:06,237
Why not ? I like them !

928
01:24:08,814 --> 01:24:11,627
Are you sure ?

929
01:24:12,578 --> 01:24:14,524
It's not such a good idea.

930
01:24:14,644 --> 01:24:17,457
Think I haven't got the money for them ?

931
01:24:22,930 --> 01:24:24,989
What about a leather jacket...

932
01:24:27,528 --> 01:24:29,072
...and jeans ?

933
01:24:29,153 --> 01:24:32,640
They'd squash my balls.

934
01:24:33,591 --> 01:24:37,515
I need something loose.

935
01:24:38,072 --> 01:24:42,036
I love wearing my track-suit at home,
don't I ?

936
01:24:42,868 --> 01:24:45,011
He loves wearing his track-suit.

937
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:48,975
What about a tie ?

938
01:24:56,983 --> 01:25:00,947
No shit colours.
I want lots of colours.

939
01:25:01,381 --> 01:25:02,930
Not in public.

940
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:06,894
You're a pretty girl.

941
01:25:07,962 --> 01:25:10,301
You could earn a lot more.

942
01:25:10,935 --> 01:25:13,274
How much do they give you ?

943
01:25:13,551 --> 01:25:16,881
Will you take the suit ?
- Three of them.

944
01:25:17,078 --> 01:25:18,864
Come and work for me.

945
01:25:19,220 --> 01:25:21,837
You'll make some money,

946
01:25:21,917 --> 01:25:26,078
I've got a hotel, restaurace.

947
01:25:26,676 --> 01:25:30,125
If you knew about all I had.

948
01:25:33,850 --> 01:25:35,989
You'll be inviting her home next !

949
01:25:36,149 --> 01:25:38,368
Let her come -

950
01:25:38,608 --> 01:25:41,578
I've got a pool, ostrich...

951
01:25:41,778 --> 01:25:43,483
The ostrich's mine !

952
01:25:44,475 --> 01:25:46,734
Who bought it for you ?

953
01:25:46,934 --> 01:25:50,145
I'm not your property.

954
01:25:50,778 --> 01:25:54,345
You're not going to talk to me
like that !

955
01:25:54,542 --> 01:25:58,506
How dare you talk like that !

956
01:25:58,743 --> 01:26:02,671
She's complaining

957
01:26:03,185 --> 01:26:05,127
and she doesn't even cook !

958
01:26:05,207 --> 01:26:08,457
Auntie has to do it all,
poor little thing.

959
01:26:08,855 --> 01:26:12,618
Who made your breakfast ?
- It was inedible !

960
01:26:14,684 --> 01:26:18,608
Where would you be without me ?

961
01:26:23,443 --> 01:26:26,457
Supposed to be a masseuse,

962
01:26:26,536 --> 01:26:28,201
she's a whore.

963
01:26:28,319 --> 01:26:33,551
I live with her - fuck her !

964
01:26:34,305 --> 01:26:38,743
It'll be all right.
- Has she really gone ?

965
01:26:42,354 --> 01:26:44,970
I'm fucking fond of her !

966
01:26:45,326 --> 01:26:48,180
I really love her !

967
01:26:51,511 --> 01:26:55,435
It's all right, let's pay for this...

968
01:26:56,506 --> 01:26:59,439
We've finished.

969
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:04,395
You think I'm some whore ?

970
01:27:04,832 --> 01:27:08,002
You whistle and I come running ?

971
01:27:08,082 --> 01:27:12,006
I'm not having any.
- Vlasta !

972
01:27:13,395 --> 01:27:17,358
I'm not having any.
- Vlasta !

973
01:27:19,381 --> 01:27:23,345
You're the only one.
- You're not getting any !

974
01:27:24,176 --> 01:27:27,032
Don't be silly.

975
01:27:29,332 --> 01:27:32,145
No chance, forget it.
- Forget it ?

976
01:27:32,345 --> 01:27:34,286
Only if we live together.

977
01:27:36,032 --> 01:27:39,239
But we are together.

978
01:27:40,627 --> 01:27:42,966
I'm not being a slave for anyone.

979
01:27:47,051 --> 01:27:50,024
I'll move in and that'll be that.

980
01:27:52,957 --> 01:27:57,399
You stink ! God knows
what you've been doing !

981
01:27:57,559 --> 01:28:00,845
She's the one doing things !

982
01:28:11,947 --> 01:28:14,011
What do you want ?

983
01:28:15,158 --> 01:28:17,103
I want gas.

984
01:28:17,737 --> 01:28:21,064
I withdrew the application !

985
01:28:23,127 --> 01:28:25,466
I want it.

986
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:28,993
I'll pay for the whole village
to have it.

987
01:28:29,551 --> 01:28:33,317
Vlasta needs it.
- She lives with you ?

988
01:28:35,614 --> 01:28:38,390
Are you living with him ? - Yes.

989
01:28:40,055 --> 01:28:43,979
She's living with you ?
- The gas is what's important.

990
01:28:45,011 --> 01:28:48,975
Pull me in, let's have some brandy.

991
01:29:05,663 --> 01:29:08,875
Careful... I don't want to get wet.

992
01:29:08,953 --> 01:29:10,858
Give me your hand.

993
01:29:14,582 --> 01:29:17,279
Now my bum's wet. Christ !

994
01:29:19,184 --> 01:29:21,087
Stop all that drinking !

995
01:29:26,832 --> 01:29:29,489
You've got a horse as well ?

996
01:29:29,608 --> 01:29:33,573
That's no horse, she's a treasure.

997
01:29:38,805 --> 01:29:41,145
We going to get that gas ?

998
01:29:41,345 --> 01:29:45,270
It'll cost half a million !

999
01:29:50,224 --> 01:29:52,286
It's not a matter of money.

1000
01:29:52,524 --> 01:29:56,645
Yes, it is and stop drinking !

1001
01:29:57,479 --> 01:30:01,243
I'm glad I've got you !

1002
01:30:06,399 --> 01:30:09,015
You were always stupid !

1003
01:30:09,649 --> 01:30:13,612
You could've had it for free
but you didn't want it.

1004
01:30:16,625 --> 01:30:20,551
She's back, the one who was here.

1005
01:30:24,595 --> 01:30:28,520
Irenka's come back to me !

1006
01:30:35,536 --> 01:30:37,479
You're not coming here !

1007
01:30:38,546 --> 01:30:42,475
Go back home -
what are you doing here ?

1008
01:30:56,703 --> 01:30:59,402
Tell her something !

1009
01:30:59,756 --> 01:31:02,375
This is Vlasta.

1010
01:31:03,841 --> 01:31:07,765
Have we got a servant ?
- How dare you !

1011
01:31:07,886 --> 01:31:10,661
They told me what you were.

1012
01:31:10,778 --> 01:31:12,524
You're a whore !

1013
01:31:12,603 --> 01:31:16,131
How dare you, you village cow !

1014
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:19,301
Who are you calling a cow ? !
- Hands off me !

1015
01:31:19,538 --> 01:31:23,305
You keep your hands of Bohus !

1016
01:31:26,319 --> 01:31:28,261
Cut it out, girls !

1017
01:31:29,131 --> 01:31:32,265
Irena ! Vlasta !

1018
01:31:38,288 --> 01:31:41,028
Stop that !

1019
01:31:43,644 --> 01:31:46,341
She scratches like the devil !

1020
01:31:46,457 --> 01:31:50,381
Scratch her eyes out and drown her !

1021
01:32:09,729 --> 01:32:13,693
The rich bugger won't do anything
for the village !

1022
01:32:13,810 --> 01:32:17,457
We swim in this filth
and he gets a swimming pool !

1023
01:32:18,091 --> 01:32:21,067
I bought you all gas !

1024
01:32:23,644 --> 01:32:26,737
What would you like, children ?

1025
01:32:26,854 --> 01:32:28,993
I want to stroke your horse.

1026
01:32:29,274 --> 01:32:32,404
Better not, he bites.

1027
01:32:32,604 --> 01:32:35,377
He's an Arab bugger !

1028
01:32:37,439 --> 01:32:41,957
I want a merry-go-round !
- Great idea . I'll get one !

1029
01:33:01,899 --> 01:33:03,881
Gutten Tag !

1030
01:33:07,886 --> 01:33:11,850
I fucking said "Gutten Tag"  !
- Where's your cowboy hat !

1031
01:33:12,684 --> 01:33:16,171
I don't need one, I've got glasses.

1032
01:33:18,112 --> 01:33:22,277
How's it going ?
- The work goes on.

1033
01:33:22,631 --> 01:33:24,970
We won't get anything for free.

1034
01:33:25,207 --> 01:33:28,618
If you knew what a slog it is

1035
01:33:28,818 --> 01:33:31,354
having so much money.

1036
01:33:32,782 --> 01:33:34,725
You wouldn't envy me.

1037
01:33:36,786 --> 01:33:40,430
That spring is pure water.

1038
01:33:41,739 --> 01:33:45,309
We could bottle it.

1039
01:33:45,743 --> 01:33:47,688
We'd sell fucking gallons !

1040
01:33:47,805 --> 01:33:50,661
3 or 4 crowns a bottle.

1041
01:33:51,692 --> 01:33:54,983
A machine to do it can't cost
that much.

1042
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:59,024
I'm buying a merry-go-round.
Have some fags instead.

1043
01:33:59,225 --> 01:34:02,591
Everyone wants to borrow money.

1044
01:34:04,453 --> 01:34:06,201
Dig the well by hand !

1045
01:34:08,184 --> 01:34:11,948
I pour water - I sell water.
- So you're not in ?

1046
01:34:14,604 --> 01:34:17,538
I'd buy the machine
and you'd work on it.

1047
01:34:18,055 --> 01:34:22,020
You'd still be in the shits.

1048
01:34:23,207 --> 01:34:26,497
Some bottles might go missing...

1049
01:34:28,282 --> 01:34:30,899
They give money to maternity hospitals.

1050
01:34:31,019 --> 01:34:34,943
You read about murders, rape...

1051
01:34:39,301 --> 01:34:41,761
Where does it start ?
In the maternity ward.

1052
01:34:41,877 --> 01:34:45,845
I'm not giving my money
to some perverts.

1053
01:34:50,837 --> 01:34:52,782
Where the hell is my horse ?

1054
01:34:54,447 --> 01:34:57,457
She's Arabian. - What's her name ?

1055
01:34:57,818 --> 01:35:01,145
Hathavitlah.

1056
01:35:04,399 --> 01:35:08,322
You've got to be polite to her.
- Come back !

1057
01:35:20,332 --> 01:35:24,256
Don't breathe alcohol fumes
all over her !

1058
01:35:30,877 --> 01:35:32,108
Hathavitlah ! Wait !

1059
01:35:51,176 --> 01:35:53,118
Stop that !

1060
01:35:54,189 --> 01:35:57,520
I want to read my paper !

1061
01:36:00,136 --> 01:36:03,506
You're always asleep !
- We want to go to the theatre.

1062
01:36:08,104 --> 01:36:12,068
You promised.
- The promises he makes !

1063
01:36:22,060 --> 01:36:25,983
You've got your satellite, ostrich...

1064
01:36:27,845 --> 01:36:29,868
...video, gas.

1065
01:36:30,028 --> 01:36:32,957
The gas isn't working.

1066
01:36:33,395 --> 01:36:35,734
And you've got the pool.

1067
01:36:37,002 --> 01:36:38,947
I'm bored !

1068
01:36:40,970 --> 01:36:43,309
Let's go.

1069
01:36:51,911 --> 01:36:55,358
The water heater doesn't work.

1070
01:36:55,913 --> 01:36:58,849
What shall we do ?

1071
01:37:00,474 --> 01:37:03,487
Let's go shopping.

1072
01:37:12,841 --> 01:37:14,943
What now ? - We want money.

1073
01:37:15,814 --> 01:37:19,027
I haven't got any -
I bought the kids that ride.

1074
01:37:19,818 --> 01:37:23,743
Well, 5000 at least !
- I haven't even got 1000 !

1075
01:37:26,796 --> 01:37:30,087
I'll get my lawyer to bring some more.

1076
01:37:32,739 --> 01:37:34,487
Take off that stupid beret !

1077
01:37:34,605 --> 01:37:38,569
I need it against the sun !

1078
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:41,899
Give me my beret !

1079
01:37:42,693 --> 01:37:46,657
You think we're your servants ?

1080
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:50,618
Let's go.

1081
01:37:51,612 --> 01:37:54,426
What are you then ?

1082
01:37:54,663 --> 01:37:56,966
You don't cook...

1083
01:37:57,837 --> 01:38:00,176
I'll fucking kick you out !

1084
01:38:01,644 --> 01:38:04,576
- He's angry with us !

1085
01:38:04,654 --> 01:38:07,551
He's frowning at us !

1086
01:38:08,578 --> 01:38:12,542
What are you doing ? Stop it !

1087
01:38:15,358 --> 01:38:18,489
Where are you dragging me ?

1088
01:38:18,966 --> 01:38:22,375
Just putting you to bed !
- I don't want to !

1089
01:38:22,533 --> 01:38:25,470
You do, really !

1090
01:38:25,983 --> 01:38:28,282
I don't want to go to bed !

1091
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:31,453
Let me go !

1092
01:38:35,974 --> 01:38:38,787
But it's filthy in there !

1093
01:38:39,027 --> 01:38:42,118
We'll wash you first !

1094
01:38:46,439 --> 01:38:49,770
I don't want to go to bed !

1095
01:39:26,282 --> 01:39:30,203
We're all going to Africa

1096
01:39:31,237 --> 01:39:35,201
to see their women !

1097
01:39:36,627 --> 01:39:38,569
No girls allowed on this trip !

1098
01:40:10,564 --> 01:40:14,407
Get me a bottle !

1099
01:40:19,046 --> 01:40:20,988
Catch !

1100
01:40:30,979 --> 01:40:33,792
Where could I find Mr. Stejskal ?

1101
01:40:33,989 --> 01:40:37,716
Where could he find Mr. Stejskal,

1102
01:40:37,953 --> 01:40:39,899
girls ? !

1103
01:40:41,917 --> 01:40:44,895
They're down by the lake.

1104
01:40:44,974 --> 01:40:48,261
He bought them a merry-go-round !

1105
01:40:48,381 --> 01:40:51,832
What did he buy them ? ! - A merry-
go-round ! - What are you saying ? !

1106
01:40:52,108 --> 01:40:54,845
It's true ! - That cretin !

1107
01:41:20,770 --> 01:41:24,694
Take the Doc's car.
- How dare you !

1108
01:41:27,627 --> 01:41:31,078
I'll settle up.

1109
01:41:31,197 --> 01:41:34,487
No, you won't, you pauper !

1110
01:41:36,947 --> 01:41:38,652
You're poor !

1111
01:41:39,483 --> 01:41:42,060
I'm finished !

1112
01:41:44,078 --> 01:41:46,817
It certainly is !

1113
01:41:48,796 --> 01:41:52,564
Where the fuck's my beret ?

1114
01:41:52,841 --> 01:41:54,786
You haven't got a brass farthing.

1115
01:42:00,612 --> 01:42:03,546
This is terrible !

1116
01:42:08,064 --> 01:42:11,037
Why didn't you tell me ?

1117
01:42:11,555 --> 01:42:15,479
What ?
- Your father's a step-father !

1118
01:42:17,261 --> 01:42:21,189
My Dad wasn't my Dad ?

1119
01:42:23,288 --> 01:42:25,430
But I'm my Dad all over !

1120
01:42:27,489 --> 01:42:31,413
All that money ! - Then my Mum...

1121
01:42:33,478 --> 01:42:37,403
Who was my Dad ? - Who gives a damn ?

1122
01:42:37,837 --> 01:42:40,375
What'll I tell my wife ?

1123
01:42:40,493 --> 01:42:44,377
Who gives a toss ?

1124
01:42:45,212 --> 01:42:49,136
You'd better watch your manners
with me.

1125
01:42:50,403 --> 01:42:53,060
You owe me 1.453.000.

1126
01:42:53,180 --> 01:42:57,104
Without that fairground ride. Sign here.

1127
01:43:00,157 --> 01:43:04,078
I feel sick,
I haven't even got a pencil.

1128
01:43:06,301 --> 01:43:08,282
You rascal !

1129
01:43:10,701 --> 01:43:13,238
Just you wait !

1130
01:43:14,546 --> 01:43:16,368
Why ?

1131
01:43:18,274 --> 01:43:21,207
Why... ?

1132
01:43:22,555 --> 01:43:26,002
I'm asking why ?

1133
01:43:40,157 --> 01:43:43,881
I'm asking you why ?

1134
01:43:47,131 --> 01:43:50,502
Can you tell me why ?

1135
01:43:58,114 --> 01:44:01,046
Don't do this to me !

1136
01:44:03,229 --> 01:44:05,926
Come back home !

1137
01:44:08,067 --> 01:44:11,000
Don't be silly !

1138
01:44:16,511 --> 01:44:18,372
Get lost !

1139
01:44:25,984 --> 01:44:28,917
Don't be stupid !

1140
01:44:30,661 --> 01:44:33,676
I love you even if I haven't got
any money !

1141
01:45:34,685 --> 01:45:36,627
You smoke ?

1142
01:45:37,661 --> 01:45:40,631
Just the odd one.

1143
01:45:42,854 --> 01:45:45,587
"Start" brand.

1144
01:45:50,622 --> 01:45:52,567
You drink ?

1145
01:45:54,587 --> 01:45:57,560
Occasionally I have a glass.

1146
01:46:04,537 --> 01:46:07,907
To clean out the system.

1147
01:46:08,542 --> 01:46:12,270
Have some, I made it myself.

1148
01:46:12,903 --> 01:46:15,479
Do you speak the truth ?

1149
01:46:15,716 --> 01:46:19,640
Well, the boys helped me.

1150
01:46:23,091 --> 01:46:25,112
We help each other.

1151
01:46:26,658 --> 01:46:28,801
Have some.

1152
01:46:35,818 --> 01:46:39,345
You've got wings instead.

1153
01:46:39,542 --> 01:46:41,761
You can't use a glass.

1154
01:46:45,368 --> 01:46:47,314
Can you drink anyway ?

1155
01:46:55,122 --> 01:46:57,225
Are you afraid of me ?

1156
01:46:58,252 --> 01:47:01,305
I'm just a bit surprised.

1157
01:47:01,703 --> 01:47:05,233
I've always believed but

1158
01:47:06,301 --> 01:47:10,228
sometimes I've had my doubts.

1159
01:47:15,261 --> 01:47:18,197
A person's surprised when he

1160
01:47:18,274 --> 01:47:21,962
suddenly sees the truth.

1161
01:47:22,238 --> 01:47:26,162
He sees that the truth exists.

1162
01:47:33,180 --> 01:47:35,520
Look, I've got wet knees.

1163
01:47:39,364 --> 01:47:42,140
Let me pour you some...
I forgot, you can't.

1164
01:47:43,131 --> 01:47:45,072
To your health.

1165
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:48,640
I'm surprised,

1166
01:47:48,841 --> 01:47:52,250
I think I'll get plastered. Sorry.

1167
01:47:57,087 --> 01:48:01,011
I've just lost everything.
- I know, Bohumil.

1168
01:48:02,832 --> 01:48:05,288
They took away my horse.

1169
01:48:06,322 --> 01:48:09,733
I know, Bohumil.

1170
01:48:12,309 --> 01:48:16,274
They all call me Bohus.

1171
01:48:17,185 --> 01:48:19,801
No-one's called me Bohumil in years.

1172
01:48:19,957 --> 01:48:21,782
Dad called me Bohumil.

1173
01:48:21,983 --> 01:48:25,907
He'd say: Bohumil, you're going
to get such a hiding !"

1174
01:48:26,738 --> 01:48:30,466
He loved me. - I know.

1175
01:48:33,913 --> 01:48:36,252
What's person to believe ?

1176
01:48:38,712 --> 01:48:42,636
I always thought my Dad was my Dad.

1177
01:48:44,854 --> 01:48:48,819
I know. - What do you know ?

1178
01:48:50,841 --> 01:48:52,783
Irenka's gone,

1179
01:48:53,614 --> 01:48:55,756
Vlasta won't talk to me.

1180
01:48:57,819 --> 01:48:59,761
They all want money,

1181
01:49:01,189 --> 01:49:03,131
they're all laughing at me.

1182
01:49:09,551 --> 01:49:12,091
No-one believes anyone.

1183
01:49:12,527 --> 01:49:15,698
Can't you do something,
for fuck's sake ?

1184
01:49:28,661 --> 01:49:30,645
Bohumil !

1185
01:49:33,657 --> 01:49:37,027
You shouldn't say "fuck"  !

1186
01:49:44,399 --> 01:49:48,363
Your plum brandy smells wonderful !

1187
01:49:59,542 --> 01:50:02,479
Pig ! - Listen to her !

1188
01:50:09,890 --> 01:50:12,506
Me, too. - I'll have you, gorgeous !

1189
01:50:23,448 --> 01:50:26,381
How's it going, Onassis ?

1190
01:50:28,403 --> 01:50:30,386
Stupid idiot !

1191
01:50:32,962 --> 01:50:35,341
Give me another.

1192
01:50:45,729 --> 01:50:48,305
Good day to you !

1193
01:50:53,103 --> 01:50:55,520
It's Arnost !

1194
01:50:58,292 --> 01:51:01,743
I'd completely forgotten about you !

1195
01:51:04,162 --> 01:51:06,225
Where'd you get that nose from ?

1196
01:51:06,739 --> 01:51:10,582
Bohus paid for my cosmetic surgery !

1197
01:51:14,907 --> 01:51:18,474
Thank you very much.

1198
01:51:18,591 --> 01:51:22,555
Come and sit down.
- He looks like a man now !

1199
01:51:27,551 --> 01:51:31,515
Here's the hospital bill -

1200
01:51:31,752 --> 01:51:33,895
9.600 crowns.

1201
01:51:34,011 --> 01:51:36,828
Thank you so much for my nose.

1202
01:51:37,542 --> 01:51:39,881
You haven't heard.

1203
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,063
We're fucked !

1204
01:51:42,895 --> 01:51:45,233
I haven't a bean !
- What do you mean ? !

1205
01:51:45,470 --> 01:51:49,435
I'm as poor as I was, a complete beggar !

1206
01:51:51,060 --> 01:51:55,024
No pool, no ostrich, satellite gone.

1207
01:51:56,015 --> 01:51:58,354
No-one gives a shit.

1208
01:51:58,511 --> 01:52:00,970
You're my only friend.

1209
01:52:04,024 --> 01:52:06,163
You'll just have to start saving.

1210
01:52:08,188 --> 01:52:11,912
From what ? I've got a disabled pension.

1211
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:15,442
Just fuck it, they're not going
to cut it off.

1212
01:52:16,947 --> 01:52:19,684
The bastards took
the marry-go-round as well.

1213
01:52:19,801 --> 01:52:22,377
I didn't give the doc anything.

1214
01:52:22,536 --> 01:52:25,233
I never signed anything.
I'm not stupid.

1215
01:52:25,907 --> 01:52:27,493
What can they take away from you ?

1216
01:52:28,286 --> 01:52:30,506
Maybe your old banger.

1217
01:52:31,614 --> 01:52:34,072
My old banger ? !

1218
01:52:38,076 --> 01:52:41,805
How much did it cost ?
- 9.650 crowns.

1219
01:52:41,921 --> 01:52:44,778
You just add another fifty
and you've got it.

1220
01:52:45,212 --> 01:52:46,957
No, I'll have money left over.

1221
01:52:47,234 --> 01:52:51,161
Now you've got 9600.
- So, I'll have 50 left.

1222
01:52:51,595 --> 01:52:53,417
You'll make money on it !

1223
01:52:57,782 --> 01:53:00,712
Always someone going on about money.

1224
01:53:06,739 --> 01:53:10,663
You're not going to believe this...

1225
01:53:11,734 --> 01:53:14,667
...but an angel appeared
in front of me.

1226
01:53:17,087 --> 01:53:18,951
What angel ?

1227
01:53:19,068 --> 01:53:22,042
Onassis needs an angel now.

1228
01:53:22,676 --> 01:53:26,006
What are you laughing at ?

1229
01:53:27,828 --> 01:53:31,792
He just came out of the water

1230
01:53:32,627 --> 01:53:36,551
and talked like I'm talking to you now.

1231
01:53:44,362 --> 01:53:46,502
As they say:

1232
01:53:46,618 --> 01:53:50,506
I'm an atheist, thank God.

1233
01:53:54,273 --> 01:53:55,462
That's him.

1234
01:53:56,332 --> 01:54:00,256
I'm looking for Bohumil Stejskal.

1235
01:54:04,104 --> 01:54:07,434
I'm Dr. Guardian.

1236
01:54:26,381 --> 01:54:30,069
Your father died in Argentina

1237
01:54:30,189 --> 01:54:32,926
and left you his fortune.

1238
01:54:35,145 --> 01:54:40,100
Roughly 10 million dollars.

1239
01:55:01,625 --> 01:55:05,591
Now I can buy you all !

1240
