1
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:14,100
- 干我吧，宝贝 - 当然
Yeah. Fuck me, baby. Yes, please.

2
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,120
喂？
Hello?

3
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,160
想找乐子吗？
Want to have a little fun?

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,260
你是谁？
Who is this?

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,560
你先说你的吧
Tell me your name,

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,600
我才不要
I'll tell you mine.

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,970
我不这样认为
I don't think so.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,500
什么声音？
What's that noise?

9
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,770
我放屁了
I farted.

10
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,310
没想到你听得见
I didn't think you would hear me.

11
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,740
不，那噗噗的声音
No, that popping noise.

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,850
我在做爆米花
I'm making popcorn and

13
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,880
准备看片子
getting ready to watch a video.

14
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:40,050
什么片子？
What is it?

15
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,450
只是部恐怖片
It's just a scary movie.

16
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,450
你喜欢恐怖片吗？
Do you like scary movies?

17
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,650
你最喜欢那一部？
What's your favorite?

18
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:46,620
不知道
I don't know.

19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:47,780
想想嘛
Think.

20
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,620
有了，是精灵也疯狂
I know! Kazaam.

21
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,090
侠客欧尼尔演精灵的那一部
You know, the one where Shaq plays a genie.

22
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,100
那不是恐怖片
That's not a horror movie.

23
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,190
那是你没看过欧尼尔的演技
Well, you haven't seen Shaq act.

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,500
你的声音很甜美
Hey, you have a nice voice.

25
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:00,900
谢了
Thanks.

26
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,210
你没告诉我你是谁
You never did tell me your name.

27
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,910
你为何想知道？
Why do you want to know my name?

28
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,380
我想知道我现在正在看的是谁
Because I want to know who I'm looking at.

29
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,040
你说什么？
What did you say?

30
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,250
大波霸
Nice breasts.

31
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,640
你想干嘛？
Look, what do you want?

32
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,760
我想看看你里面有没有料
I want to see what your insides look like.

33
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,860
那就翻到55页
Well, then, turn to page fifty-four.

34
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,430
好耶
Hey, nice.

35
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,690
混球，你闹够了
Listen, asshole, you've had your fun!

36
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,230
你最好就此打住
Now you'd better stop or else.

37
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,600
不然呢？
Or else what?

38
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,530
我男友随时会到
Or else my boyfriend's

39
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,730
他是黑人
going to be here any minute.

40
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,810
可以扁死你
And he's black and he'll kick your ass!

41
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,730
是吗？
Oh, really?

42
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,340
对
Yeah.

43
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,610
你是指打扮成女人的那个？
You mean the one who wears makeup and dresses like a woman?

44
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,040
你怎么知道？
How did you know?

45
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,180
把阳台的灯打开
Turn the porch lights on.

46
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,620
救命、救命
Help! Help!

47
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,450
不是他啦
That's not my boyfriend.

48
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,860
我不过就
I've fucked him a couple times,

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,890
跟他上过几次床而已
but that's it.

50
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,000
我要报警了
Look, I'm calling the cops!

51
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,470
去啊，去报警啊
Go ahead. Call the cops.

52
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,600
但你最好先查看一下后门
But you might want to check the back door first.

53
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,770
你忘了上锁了
You forgot to lock it.

54
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,390
接招吧，大变态
Take that, you psycho!

55
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,330
我的脚没知觉了
I can't feel my legs.

56
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,840
我的手断了
I think my arm is broken.

57
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,430
抱歉
Sorry.

58
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,240
我要跟我妈讲
I want my mommy.

59
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,580
你好，茱儿
Hello, Drew.

60
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,850
天啊
Oh, God.

61
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,730
天啊
Oh, God.

62
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,000
天啊
Oh, God.

63
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,970
“活路/死路”
SAFETY DEATH

64
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,700
不
No!

65
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,050
爸
Daddy!

66
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,690
爸
Daddy!

67
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:20,600
爸，不、不...
Daddy, no! No!

68
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,370
什么声音？
Did you hear something?

69
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,940
我没听见什么声音
No, I didn't hear anything.

70
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,400
巴比，你干嘛？我爸就在隔壁
Bobby, what are you doing? My dad's in the other room!

71
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:01,440
我想起我从未从窗户爬进来过
It just occurred to me I never climbed through your window before.

72
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,040
现在你满足了吧，你快走吧
Yeah, well, now that you got it out of your system, Bobby, you have to leave!

73
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,280
为什么？
Why?

74
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,240
小心
Come on.

75
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,820
里面怎么了？
What's going on in there?

76
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,360
老爸的头卡住了
Daddy's head is stuck.

77
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,480
快松开
Unstick Daddy's head.

78
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,820
爸，拜托你先敲门嘛
Dad, can you knock?

79
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:17,890
敲门？
Knock?

80
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,330
我听见里面有人尖叫
I thought I heard screaming in here.

81
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,300
没有人尖叫啊
No, you didn't , Dad.

82
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,330
可能是我刚喀药的幻觉吧
It could have been that crack I smoked earlier, I guess.

83
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:25,830
没错
That's what it was.

84
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,800
我要离开镇上几天
I got to leave town for a couple days.

85
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,000
别担心
No big deal.

86
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,740
我跟那几个哥伦比亚人的生意
That new business I started with those Colombians - -

87
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,000
你是说艾斯可叔叔
You mean Uncle Escobar.

88
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,210
对
That's right.

89
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,470
出了问题
There's a problem.

90
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,910
有些钱不见了
Some money went missing.

91
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,750
看来有些人会完了
Apparently, some legs are going to get broken.

92
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,780
我最好还是躲个几天吧
It's just better if I lay low for a couple of days.

93
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,810
如果警察来查
Now if the cops raid the place.

94
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:43,820
我根本不认识你
I never heard of you.

95
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,820
别忘了
And don't forget.

96
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,420
湮灭证据
To flush your stash.

97
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,090
你真棒
You are my little girl.

98
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,450
我爱你...
I love you so much.

99
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,630
我在咖啡罐里留了点好料给你
...that I left you a little something in the coffee can.

100
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,900
卖之前记得要掺点料
But you have to remember to step on it before you sell it.

101
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,260
你要拿什么掺进去？
Now, what are you going to cut it with?

102
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,870
苏打...
Baking....

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,030
苏打粉，不是发粉
Baking soda. Not baking powder.

104
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,000
放发粉
Because baking powder guys

105
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,730
帅哥就会发了
will have muffins growing out of their nose.

106
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,470
你就喜欢这样
You love that joke,

107
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:05,140
对吧？
don't you, honey?

108
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,580
你两岁时就喜欢这样掺了
You've loved that joke since you were two years old.

109
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,000
好吧...
Okay, well...

110
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,810
我爱你
Okay, I love you.

111
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:11,750
我爱你
I love you.

112
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:12,910
一路顺风
Have a good trip.

113
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,710
拜
Bye.

114
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,050
安全了？
Is the coast clear?

115
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,750
辛蒂，这件睡衣...
Cindy, that nightgown.

116
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,150
真惊险，天啊
That was close. God.

117
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:31,100
我本来在家看“大法师”
I was home watching The Exorcist.

118
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,500
那片子却让我想起你
And it got me thinking about you.

119
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,830
若你是想起我吐绿黏液
If this is about the time I puked green slime.

120
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,500
还用十字架自慰的那次
and masturbated with a crucifix...

121
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,840
那是我第一次参加饮酒大会
...it was my first keg party, Bobby.

122
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,910
不，不
No, no.

123
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,010
那是电视版
It was edited for TV.

124
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,510
精彩片段都剪了
All the good stuff was cut out.

125
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,180
那你是想爬上来跟我玩耍？
So you thought you would just climb through my window and play bump-bump?

126
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,810
我是希望有人能舔我蛋蛋
I was kind of hoping to get my balls licked...

127
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,890
但我决不会动你内裤
...but I wouldn't want to break

128
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,010
好吗？
your underwear rule, now, would I?

129
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,820
也许我能跟你隔着睡衣玩玩？
So maybe just some on-top-of-the-clothes type stuff?.

130
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,930
好吧，就一下子
Okay. But just for a minute.

131
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,730
搞什么...
What the...?

132
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,620
跑错场景了
Wrong set.

133
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,100
巴比，不要
No, Bobby, don't.

134
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,630
妈呀
Jeez.

135
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,690
“禁止入内”
NO TRESPASSING

136
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:41,970
是我爸
Yeah, my dad.

137
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,200
好了，大种马
Okay, stud.

138
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,270
你该走了
You have to go now.

139
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:55,220
关于上床的事
About the sex stuff. I was only half serious.

140
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,450
我并不想逼你
I mean, I don't want to rush you.

141
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,320
你接受辅导级的画面吗？
Would you settle for PG-thirteen?

142
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:00,890
什么？
What's that?

143
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,090
天啊
Oh, jeez.

144
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,590
晚安，巴比
Good night, Bobby.

145
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,740
矮子，你好吵
Shorty, you are so loud.

146
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,970
记得今天要去上课
And make sure you take your behind to class today.

147
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,470
我会去上课的
I do be going to class.

148
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,340
吃便当不叫上课
Lunch is not a class, Shorty.

149
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,770
偷吃零食总算吧
It is when you got the munchies.

150
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,110
看吧，你就是这么蠢
See, that's why you such a dumb-ass.

151
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,390
去你妈的
Your mother.

152
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,120
你是我弟，那也是你妈
You my brother.

153
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,750
对喔
That's your mother too, jackass.

154
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,990
那...你爸是猪头
Oh, yeah. Well, then, your father's stupid.

155
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,390
又怎样？我又不知他是谁
So? I don't know him.

156
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,230
是啊，我也是
Yeah, me neither.

157
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,190
辣妹，准备好了？
Hey, girl, you ready?

158
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,660
一会就好
Yeah, in a minute.

159
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:48,770
快点，我们迟到了
Come on, we'll be late.

160
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,810
等等，帕妃来了
Wait, there's Buffy.

161
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,440
你干嘛跟她混
I don't know why you hang out with her.

162
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,540
她是个贱货
She is such a ho.

163
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,670
你干嘛这样说？
Why do you say that?

164
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,080
因为我知道
Because I've seen her.

165
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,510
我朋友小席夏天开了泳池派对
My friend Sean had a pool party this summer.

166
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:02,820
你知道的，吹牛老爹
You know, Puff Daddy.

167
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,050
总之
Anyway,

168
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,250
大家都在喝法国香槟
everybody was drinking Crystal champagne.

169
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,550
接着大家都发疯
And then it started to get wild,

170
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:08,890
在池里乱搞
and people was getting freaky in the pool.

171
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,160
我看到
I look over and

172
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,460
她在按摩池跟男人乱搞
there was your girl getting buck-wild in the Jacuzzi.

173
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,360
那又怎样？
So?

174
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,370
对方是个伴舞的
With a backup dancer.

175
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,440
那真是没格调
I mean, that's nasty.

176
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,600
那比跟警卫搞还没品
That's lower than the security guard.

177
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,270
至少警卫能放你进场看演唱会
At least security can get you backstage.

178
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,580
她真不自爱
She don't love herself.

179
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,810
我不知道
I don't know.

180
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,140
我觉得帕妃很甜美
I think Buffy's sweet, Brenda.

181
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,250
她假仙死了
She is as fake as Press-on nails

182
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,450
嘿，小甜甜
Hey, baby girl!

183
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,490
你好，好姐妹
What is up, my sister?

184
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,190
拜，吉先生
Bye, Mr. Gillmore.

185
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:43,590
他走了？
Is he gone?

186
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:44,320
对
Yep.

187
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,930
我喜欢这个颜色
I love this color.

188
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,840
让我看看
Let me see that.

189
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,250
你们不该用这个牌子
You guys should not use this brand.

190
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:05,910
为什么？
Why not?

191
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,280
他们拿产品在动物身上试验
Because they test their products on animals.

192
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:12,890
看过他们怎么对待那些动物吗
Look. Have you seen what they do to those poor animals?

193
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,530
“停止动物试验”
STOP ANIMAL TESTING!

194
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,300
我很关心大众
Well, I am much more of a people person.

195
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,300
我愿意接济世上饥贫的孩童
I'd like to feed all the hungry children of the world.

196
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,030
我宁可帮助人
I'd much rather help man than animal.

197
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,260
给我一元吧？
Spare a dollar?

198
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,970
滚远一点，脏鬼
Get away from me, you bum!

199
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,810
他只是饿了
Can't you see he's just hungry?

200
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,430
拿去吧
Here you go, sir.

201
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,940
这是三明治
A nice sandwich.

202
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,140
看到了吧？
See?

203
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,510
我要的是一元
I said a dollar, bitch!

204
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,510
天啊
God.

205
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,480
看看这地方
Look at this place.

206
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,290
真像马戏团大公演
It's a circus.

207
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,490
你们好，我是海盖儿
Hello, I'm Gail Hailstorm.

00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,360
畅销书“你死我赚”的作者
Author of the book You're Dead, I'm rich.

209
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,800
一个小镇因一桩事故陷入恐慌
A small college town is in shock after the unthinkable has happened;

210
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,130
一位少女惨遭残酷谋杀
A brutal killing spree that left one teen dead- -

211
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,700
我受够了，两位青少年死亡...
That's it. Two teens dead...

212
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,170
这个小镇陷入混乱中
...and this small town shaken and stirred.

213
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,940
这种时刻...
It's times like these...

214
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,700
警方到处寻找线索
Police are combing the area for clues.

215
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,110
目前并未找到目击证人
There are no witnesses available at this time.

216
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,680
也没有逮捕嫌疑犯
There are no suspects in custody.

217
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,840
警方请求民众协助破案

218
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,120
黑人电台为您报导

219
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:14,950
白人死了
White folks are dead.

220
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,050
我们快走
We're getting the fuck out of there!

221
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,910
快落跑啊
Let's roll, Jack!

222
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,520
妈的，快收拾好，走啊
Fuck! Grab your shit and let's go.

223
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,630
你想媒体会访问我们吗？
Do you think the press will want to talk to us?

224
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,860
不，媒体只想访问最无知的人
No. The press only wants to interview the most ignorant person they can find.

225
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,460
我上电视了
I'm on TV!

226
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,160
上回是被捕时上的
Oh, shit! First cops, now this!

227
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,740
天啊，我会变成名人的
Oh, man, I'm going to be a star,

228
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,500
孩子
son!

229
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,830
请你谈谈遇害的茱儿
What can you tell us about Drew?

230
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,510
她的屁股真大
Well, she had the fat ass.

231
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,140
大辣妹
I mean it was like bang!

232
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,750
你跟她熟吗？
How close were you to the victim?

233
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,750
很熟
Real close.

234
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,610
强暴丸药效过后，她说要告我
Till the roofies wore off. Then she woke up, Talking about pressing charges...

235
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,720
所以我就不继续舔她屁屁了
...so I just pulled my tongue out of her ass and left.

236
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,990
你想对茱儿说什么？
What would have been your last words of Drew?

237
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,080
跑，贱货，快跑啊
Run, bitch, run!

238
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,090
兄弟
Hey, yo, dawg.

239
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,060
我这样穿像同志吗？
Does this shirt make me look gay?

240
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,130
不像
No, man.

241
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,360
现在呢？
What about now?

242
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,170
不像
No.

243
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,070
很好
Cool.

244

245
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,940
别忘了周二投票
Don't forget; Election's Tuesday.

246
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,770
别忘了，周二投票
Don't forget; Election's Tuesday.

247
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,010
该死
Goddamn it!

248
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,150
他妈的旦旦面
Son of a bitch!

249
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,650
怎么了，宝贝？
What's the matter, honey?

我的成绩单
My report card.

251
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,220

至少里面还有个A嘛
At least you got one A.

253
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,300
对喔，没错
Yeah, I did, huh?

254
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,060
你真聪明
You're so smart.

255
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,070
有看到巴比吗？
Has anybody seen Bobby?

256
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,060
没有
No. You know what?

257
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:43,300
那家伙老爱迟到
That kid is always late.

258
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:44,540
我真不懂
I don't get it.

259
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,770
他住的那么近
He lives so close.

260
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:56,880
回头见了
See you later.

00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,240
我真想钻进你裤裆里

267
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:16,160
真的？
Really?

268
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,100
是啊，你穿几号的裤子？
Yeah. What size are these?

269
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,540
大家好

很好
Good.

273
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,350
有看到那些记者吗？

274
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,180
听说辣妹茱儿昨晚被人杀了
Saying that girl Drew Decker got killed last night.

275
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,720
我想我认识她
You know what? I think I knew her.

276
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:34,460
真的？
Really?

277
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,460
对，她哥叫史提夫吧？
Yeah. She had a brother named Steve?

278
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,320
没错
Yeah.

279
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,190
留长发，樱桃小嘴，俏屁股？
Long hair, pretty little mouth, perfect ass?

280
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,260
是她没错
That was her.

281
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,760
不，我说的是史提夫
No, I was talking about Steve.

282
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,860
他到底发生什么事了？
What ever happened to him?

283
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,660
你们觉得她在整整一年后...
Do you guys think it's strange

284
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,860
被人谋杀
that she got killed...

285
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,000
跟我们杀了那人
...exactly one year after we...

286
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,700
有关系吗？
...you know, killed that guy?

287
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,440
那是意外
That was an accident.

288
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,680
是吗，格瑞？
Was it, Greg?

289
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,660
你看他们在搞什么鬼？
Would you look at what they're doing?

290
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,500
我们何时才能做那档事？
When are we going to do stuff like that?

291
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:21,770
总有一天吧
One day.

292
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,300
你喜欢吗？
You like that, baby?

293
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,770
喜欢，真特别
Yeah, that's different.

294
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:26,670
你喜欢
You like that?

295
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,170
我爽透了
Oh, I love that.

296
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,370
我喜欢你摸我屁屁
Oh, I love when you play with my ass.

297
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,110
我没摸你屁屁
I'm not playing with your ass.

298
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:35,380
小雷
Ray!

299
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,280
我弄错了
Oh, my bad.

300
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,350
拜托
Come on, man.

301
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,390
巴比，放点音乐吧
Bobby, put on some music.

302
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:44,620
等等
Hold on.

303
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,560
放这卷
Here, put this on.

304
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,130
真是棒呆了
That's the shit right here.

305
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,200
宝贝
Baby.

306
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,370
停
Stop.

307
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,070
怎么？
What? What?

308
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:02,770
这很经典呢
It's a classic.

309
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,540
听收音机吧
Tune is the radio.

310
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,230
怎么？那是我妈的
What? It's launder day.

311
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:28,260
搞什么...
The fuck is...?

312
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:38,710
过来
Come over here.

313
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:40,950
干嘛？
What?

314
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,250
再靠近一点
Just get a little closer to me.

315
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:43,750
你想跟我说什么？
Something you're going to tell me?

316
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,620
你干嘛？
What are you doing?

317
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,750
我只要你摸摸它，拜托
Just touch it. Come on.

318
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,390
摸一下就好
Just a little bit. Come on.

319
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,070
我就想要你这样
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

320
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,750
爽啊
Oh, my God.

321
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,850
糟糕
Shit!

322
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,530
我的老天
Oh, my God.

323
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:31,990
怎么回事？
What was that?

324
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,240
我想我们撞到东西了
I think we hit something.

325
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,440
天啊
Oh, man!

326
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,510
你看车子撞的
Bobby, look at my car, man!

327
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,010
我爸会发飙的
My dad's going to freak!

328
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,610
我没看到
I didn't see it.

329
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,910
它突然钻出来的
It came out of nowhere.

330
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,720
天啊，我们撞上一只靴子
Oh, my God! We hit a boot!

331
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,950
脚呢？
Where's the foot?!

332
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:52,250
不知道
I don't know.

333
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,220
搞什么...
Where the...?

334
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,030
尸体在那
It's a body!

335
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,150
妈的，他死了？
Oh, shit. Is he alive?

336
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,290
不知道
I don't know.

337
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,260
去看一下
Check it out.

338
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,060
我不要
I can't.

339
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:03,920
妈的
Shit!

340
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,070
我们得报警
We have to call the police.

341
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,760
不行
No way.

342
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,670
我不要坐牢
I ain't going to jail.

343
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:08,570
一定得报警
We have to!

344
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:11,270
知道少男被送进牢会怎样吗？
Do you know what they do to young boys in prison?

345
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:16,710
那些性饥渴的囚犯就等着你
Those sex-starved convicts just waiting for a fresh piece of meat. You're right, Cindy.

346
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:17,910
也许我们该报警
Maybe we should call the police.

347
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,510
真好啊，小雷
That's a great idea, Ray.

348
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,580
布兰妲呢？
But what about Brenda?

349
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,980
你以为她想坐牢？
You think she wants to go to jail?

350
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,080
这是过失杀人
It's manslaughter.

351
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,320
我们死定了
We'll fry for this.

352
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,360
等着被关十到十五年吧
We're looking at 1 0 to 1 5 years.

353
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,620
闭嘴，巴比
Shut up, Bobby!

354
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,060
满身酒味...
Alcohol all over...

355
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:29,890
我没事
I'm fine.

356
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,420
麻烦大了
We're in so much trouble.

357
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,260
我没事
It's fine.

358
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,190
别想把责任推给我
And don't blame that shit on me, Ray.

359
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,430
天啊，我们得毁尸灭迹
Look, we'll get rid of the body.

360
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,200
不需要
Unnecessary.

361
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,330
你终于动脑袋了
Now you're thinking.

362
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,300
把他丢进海里
We'll dump him in the ocean.

363
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,700
丢码头边
Not the ocean, the pier.

364
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,830
我马上走
I'll be leaving now.

365
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:43,770
好主意
That's a great idea.

366
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:44,810
酒呢？
What about the alcohol?

367
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:45,730
丢了它
We'll get rid of it.

368
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,710
不会有问题的
It'll be all right.

369
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,440
没错
Absolutely.

370
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:48,500
动手吧
Come on. Let's go.

371
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,840
把他塞进后车厢
Put him in the trunk.

372
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,140
我不想跟这件事有关连
I won't have anything to do with this.

373
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:52,940
闭嘴
Shut up!

374
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,350
辛蒂，拜托
Cindy, come on.

375
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,110
我们就假装什么都没发生过
We'll just pretend it never happened.

376
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,990
就像我们喝醉乱搞那次一样
You know, like the time we got drunk and we went down on each other.

377
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:00,950
我抓他的手
I'll get his arm.

378
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:01,850
我抓其他只手
I'll grab his other arm.

379
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:02,690
我抓他屁屁
I'll grab his ass.

380
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,960
我们把他丢到威森湾里
We'll take him to Williamson Cove and dump him in there.

381
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,630
鲨鱼会帮我们料理他
The sharks'll take care of the evidence.

382
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,760
天啊，有人来了
God, someone's coming.

383
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,130
该死，是矮子
Oh, shit. It's Shorty.

384
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,460
布兰妲，搞定他
Brenda, take care of him.

385
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,140
矮子，你一定是无照驾驶
Shorty, I know you ain't driving

386
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,470
我有
without no papers.

387
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,240
我罩子亮着呢
I got papers, blunts, bongs...

388
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:29,640
还有令人精神振奋的好料
...all the ingredients to make a high nigga pie.

389
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,790
你在这干嘛？
Yo, can I help you?

390
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,390
小雷啊？
Yo, what's up, Ray?

391
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,660
需要接电吗？
Yo, son, you all need jumper cables?

392
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:37,960
不，不用
No, we're cool.

393
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,220
很好，反正我也没带
Good, I left my roach clip at home.

394
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,190
回家去，矮子
Go home, Shorty.

395
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,220
回头见
I'll see you later.

396
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,730
拜了，小雷
Peace, Ray.

397
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,040
把后车厢关上
Get the trunk closed.

398
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,300
关不起来
It won't close.

399
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:50,800
我来
I'll do it.

400
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,940
拜托
Hey! Come on!

401
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,300
等等，把他放下
Hold on. Put him down.

402
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,560
他真重.天啊
He's heavr. Oh, God.

403
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:22,860
好，听着
Jesus. Okay, look.

404
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,440
数到三就把他丢下去
On three we dump him over the ledge.

405
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,370
等等
Wait.

406
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,030
检查一下他的皮夹吧
Shouldn't we at least check his wallet?

407
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,180
干嘛？
For what?

408
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,440
他也许有钱呢
Shit, he might have some money.

409
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,150
我们已杀了他
We already committed murder.

410
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,980
就顺便抢他吧
We might as well rob his ass.

411
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,920
我拿信用卡
I'll take the credit cards.

412
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,020
我要珠宝
I want his jewelry.

413
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,090
我要他的内裤
I'll take his drawers.

414
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,550
放手...
Get off!. Hey, y'all, get off.

415
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,120
他的内裤是我的
His drawers are mine.

416
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,960
我拿到金戒指了
I got me a gold ring.

417
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:46,900
信用卡
Credit cards.

418
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,960
把他丢进水里吧
Let's get him in the water.

419
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,360
我做不到
I don't think I can, Greg.

420
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,640
现在还不迟
It's not too late.

421
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:52,930
闭嘴好吗？
Shut up, okay?!

422
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,830
天啊，我动手
Christ, already. I'll do it.

423
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,470
把他丢进水里就好，好吗？
Just get him into the water. Okay?

424
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,140
一，二...
One, two...

425
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:00,830
三
...three.

426
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,410
现在，我们达成协议
Right now, we make a pact.

427
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,750
一辈子都谨守秘密
We take this to our grave.

428
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:10,510
同意？
Agreed?

429
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,210
同意
Agreed.

430
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,980
说啊，辛蒂
Say it, Cindy.

431
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:16,720
说啊
Say it!

432
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,930
一辈子谨守秘密
We take this to our grave!

433
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,620
说啊，一辈子都谨守秘密
Say it! We take this to our grave!

434
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:22,490
说啊
Say it!

435
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,030
格瑞，冷静
Greg, chill.

436
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,130
一辈子谨守秘密，格瑞
We take this to our grave, Greg.

437
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,700
我们绝口不提
And we never mention this again.

438
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:32,410
不提什么？
Mention what?

439
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,810
我们刚杀了一个人
The guy we just killed.

440
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,240
你刚刚就提了
Well, you just mentioned it, Greg.

441
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,810
从现在开始算
Starting now!

442
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,440
真是个蠢妞
Stupid bitch, man.

443
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:43,010
我恨他
God, I hate him.

444
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,610
不会有事的，宝贝
It's going to be okay, baby.

445
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:46,720
不会有事的
It's going to be okay.

446
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,380
我保证
I promise.

447
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,180
再摸一次
Just touch it again.

448
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,620
拜托
Come on. Please.

449
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,890
一切都已过去了，辛蒂
You have to move on, Cindy.

450
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:54,930
一切都已过去了
That's all behind us now.

451
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:56,260
没错
Exactly.

452
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,400
这是巧合
It's a coincidence.

453
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:58,490
格瑞说的对
Greg's right.

454
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,000
你以为我们在演恐怖片吗？
I mean, what do you think we're in A horror movie?

455
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,000
你们说的对
You guys are right.

456
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,230
如果是的话...
If we were...

457
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,240
也许演我的人会是个大波霸
...they'd probably cast some dingbat like Jennifer Love Huge Tits to play me.

458
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,310
也许会找三十岁的老演员来演
Or they'd cast people in their late twenties, early thirties to play us.

459
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,420
摄影机准备
Kenny, get the camera ready.

460
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,380
把我口香糖收好
Here, hold my gum.

461
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,460
警长，请您讲几句话
Sheriff, can I get a statement?

462
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,120
无可奉告
No comment.

463
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,690
该死
Damn.

464
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,990
我跟谁搞才弄得到内幕消息？
Who do I have to screw around here to get a stupid story?

465
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,670
别乱跑
Hey, no running.

466
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:36,660
笨蛋
Loser.

467
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,660
慢慢走
Slow it down.

468
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:39,900
咬我啊
Blow me.

469
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,700
好吧
All right.

470
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,080
我是新闻前线采访记者海盖儿
Gale Hailstorm. Field reporter, Hard Story.

471
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,940
特别警探阿呆
Special Officer Doofy.

472
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,510
阿呆
Oh, hi, Doofy. Listen.

473
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,120
校园里出了什么事？
Is there a problem on campus?

474
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,090
无可奉告
No comment. No comment.

475
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:54,710
好吧
Okay. Okay.

476
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:58,430
你真是个年轻有为的警探
You know, you look awfully young to be a police officer.

477
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,430
我二十五岁半了
I'm twenty-five and a half years old.

478
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:01,920
就这么大
That's this many.

479
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,160
真大
So big.

480
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,630
对，很大了
Yeah. That's big.

481
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,930
你看来不过才十二岁
You don't look a day over twelve.

482
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:11,540
但你的眼神可锐利了
Except for the big head and glazed-over look in your eyes.

483
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,400
那是口水吗？
Ooh, is that drool?

484
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,410
对，我忘了吞下去了
Yeah, I forgot to swallow.

485
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,410
别担心
Don't worry,

486
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,910
我不会忘的
because I never forget.

487
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,580
提醒我别再搔你了
Remind me not to do that again.

488
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:23,810
抱歉
Sorry.

489
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:24,890
针对这场悲剧
Due to the recent tragedy,

490
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,610
警长和我...
the sheriff and me, your principal...

491
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,020
会开始询问所有的学生
...will be questioning all students throughout the day.

492
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,520
看来似乎是有个连续杀人犯
Sounds like we have a serial killer on our hands.

493
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,490
我不能说
I'm not supposed to say.

494
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,930
这是警方事务
It's official police business.

495
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,660
阿呆，你和我一起去车里...
Doofy, what do you say you and I go inside my van over there...

496
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,770
互相认识一下吧？
...and get to know each other better? Would you like that?

497
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:43,900
车里？
That van?

498
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,200
对，就是那辆车
Yeah, that van right there.

499
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,240
好吧，我们走
Yeah, okay. Let's go.

500
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:51,470
走吧
Come on.

501
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,940
这真是桩可怕的悲剧
A terrible tragedy and an unbearable loss.

502
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:59,750
在这样的日子里我们需要祷告
It's days like today that we need prayer in school.

503
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:04,230
它已侵蚀我们的信念
It starts to unravel the very moral fabric of our society.

504
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,520
好了
Here you go, baby.

505
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,260
去找你爸吧
You go to your daddy.

506
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,240
下课后见
I'll see you after class.

507
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,400
好了，同学们
Okay, class.

508
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:21,400
谁要先报告？
Who would like to give their oral presentation first?

509
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,640
谁？
Anybody?

510
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:27,610
还有谁？
Anybody else?

511
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:30,790
好吧，希瑟
Okay, Heather.

512
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,050
可以开始了吗？
Okay. Can I start?

513
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:40,290
我要报告的是第一修正案
My presentation is on the First Amendment.

514
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,770
这是1787年5月25日
And it began on May 25 th,

515
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,300
华盛顿在费城推动的
1 787 in Philly with George Washington.

516
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,200
记录上说
And it states, and I quote;

517
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,400
“我们的国父...”
''When our founding fathers...''

518
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,130
“争论我国宪法的变迁”
''...argued the passage of our glorious Constitution...''

519
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,320
“我知道去年万圣节的事”
I KNO W WHAT YOU DID LAST HALLO WEEN!

520
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,050
不对
NO BITCH!

521
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:41,490
我是指你们杀了人
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE GUY YOU KILLED!

522
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:44,060
第一修正案给我们言论自由
And so the First Amendment gives us the right to say what we want.

523
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,450
给我闭嘴
Shut the fuck up.

524
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:50,560
下一个是谁？
So, who's next?

525
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,830
坎辛蒂
Cindy Campbell.

526
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:54,800
她是那个...
Isn't she the daughter of,

527
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,770
谁的女儿吗？
well, you know?

528
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:59,730
对，就是她
Yeah, you mean old Mrs...

529
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,710
性感的...
Old Mrs...

530
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,580
对，唯一的...
Yeah, the one and only...

531
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,910
独一无二的
The one and only.

532
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:09,510
你好，辛蒂
Why, hello, Cindy.

533
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,880
校长好
Hi, Principal Squiggman.

534
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,090
谢了，阿呆
Thanks, Doofy.

535
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,450
我今天是特别警探阿呆
It's Special Officer Doofy today, Cind.

536
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:19,650
警长有些问题想问你
Sheriff has some questions he'd like to ask you today.

537
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,130
什么鬼味道？
What is that God-awful smell?

538
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,160
不知道
I don't know.

539
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,430
我大便了
I got a poopie.

540
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,500
你是说...
Did you just say

541
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,800
你拉在裤子上了
that you got poopie?

542
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,670
是啊，感觉很棒
Yeah. It was good.

543
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,380
叫他出去
Get him out of here.

544
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:38,770
谢谢你，阿呆
Thank you, Doofy.

545
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,470
你该回特殊教育班上课了
You should now go back to Special Ed.

546
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,450
好，敬礼
Okay. Salute.

547
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,750
顺便换条内裤吧
Maybe a change of underwear, son.

548
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,450
拜，阿呆
Bye, Doofy.

549
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,650
拜，辛蒂
Bye, Cind.

550
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,190
你好吗，辛蒂？
How are you, Cindy?

551
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,120
很好
Fine.

552
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,090
你呢，警长？
How are you, sheriff?.

553
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,290
发福又便秘
Bloated, constipated.

554
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:55,160
屁股上还长了疮
Got a boil on my ass the size of a walnut.

555
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,320
跟以往一样
You know, the usual.

556
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,870
辛蒂，我想问你一些茱儿的事
Cindy, I want to ask you some question about Drew Decker.

557
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,600
我跟她不熟
I didn't really know her.

558
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,100
拜托
Oh, come on.

559
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:05,710
你很熟的
Sure you do.

560
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,810
不
No, I mean,

561
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,640
我跟她真的不熟
I didn't really know her.

562
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,400
少来了
Been in this game a long time.

563
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,570
别跟我打混
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.

564
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,910
谈谈茱儿吧
Tell me about Drew.

565
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,980
她在床上是什么样子？
What was she like in bed, Cindy?

566
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,350
只是捉弄你一下
Tried to get you.

567
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,520
警察就喜欢这样
It's an old police trick.

568
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,280
你不会被骗
You didn't fall for it.

569
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,790
很好
Good for you.

570
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,290
传球，传球
Pass. Pass.

571
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,030
好，洗澡了
All right, shower up!

572
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,430
好耶
Yes!

573
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,560
小杜，打的好
Yo, Dugan, man, nice play.

574
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,970
够赞！
Word up.

575
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,940
强森，阻挡的好
Johnson, what a block, baby.

576
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,440
小伍，好屁股
Woodward, nice ass.

577
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,240
妈的
Damn.

578
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,280
格瑞
Yo, Greg,

579
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,810
你要去冲澡吗？
you going to hit the showers or what?

580
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,280
不，我要去打沙包
No, man. I think I'll work out.

581
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,350
运动一下
You know, beat the bag a little.

582
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,920
随你便，好吧
Suit yourself, kid. All right.

583
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,290
最后冲澡的是大笨蛋
Last one in the shower's a rotten egg.

584
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,080
快啊
Come on.

585
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,290
我要痛扁你们罗
Come on. I'm going to get you all.

586
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,160
别让雷叔叔逮到你了

大小不重要
It's not the size of the hammer.

596
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,280
重要的是好不好用

帮我拿耳环
Hold my earrings.

607
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,870
润滑剂呢？
Where's my Vaseline?

608
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:15,470
别激动
Take it easy.

609
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,400
怎么回事？
What's the problem?

614
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:27,450
天啊
Oh, shit.

615

617
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,150
你们都去死吧
You can all go to hell.

618
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:39,290
不是只有你这样
You're not the only one who got one.

619
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:41,290
怎么？
What?

620
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,990
巴比也一样小？
You mean Bobby's got a baby dick too?

621
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,530
不，我是说收到警告
No, I was talking about the note.

622

00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,500
有人想搞我们

626

我们得报警

到处都找不到他

720
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,590
他可能把尸体弄走了

721
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,760
不可能
That's impossible.

00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,630
我想格瑞只是开玩笑
I bet it's just Greg playing another one of his dumb jokes.

725
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:42,800
一定找得到他
He'll turn up. I'm sure of it.

他也许正在我家等我们呢
He's probably at my house Waiting for us right now.

727
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,270
好吧
All right, fine.

728
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,570
但我还要到处找看看
But I'm going to look around some more.

729
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:52,110
你跟帕妃回家吧？
You mind going back home with Buffy?

730
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,270
好
No problem.

731
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,210

00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,200
小杜，听电话
Yo, Dookie! Pick up the phone!

883
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,200
干嘛？
What's up?

884
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:48,180
你呢？
What are you doing, son?

885
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:52,590
没什么，到处砍人罗
Nothing. Just chilling, killing.

886
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,560
很好，很好
True, true.

887
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:58,220
是巴比吗？
You think Bobby did it?

888
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,640
不知道
I don't know.

889
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,070
但他在场
But he was there, Buffy.

890
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:06,040
我就知道他有问题
I knew there had to be something.

891
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:07,810
他太完美了
He's just too perfect.

892
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,440
英俊，聪明，又很能“干”
Handsome, smart, good in bed.

893
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,510
你说什么？
What did you say?

894
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,080
辛蒂
Hey, Cind.

895
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,780
冰敷袋来了
Got your ice pack for your hand.

896
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:21,790
抱歉
Sorry.

897
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,180
我再拿一个来敷头
I'll get you one for your head.

898
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:27,160
不用了，阿呆
No, that's okay, Doofy.

899
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,460
我们去逮你们丢进水里的人吧
We're going to get that guy you dumped in the water.

900
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,760
我就在隔壁
I'll be next door if you need me.

901
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:35,900
晚安，辛蒂
Night, Cind.

902
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,740
你告诉他了？
Buffy, you told him?

903
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,000
那白痴听见我跟格瑞交谈
The moron overheard a conversation Greg and I were having.

904
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,510
万一他说出去怎么办？
What if he says something?

905
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:46,310
谁会相信他？
Who'll believe a retarded retard like him anyway?

906
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:47,180
别担心
Don't worry.

907
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:49,580
辛蒂，电话
Cindy, telephone.

908
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,790
喂？
Hello?

909
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:56,690
辛蒂，你好
Hello, Cindy.

910
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,830
你猜怎么着？
Guess what?

911
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,560
你们逮错人了
You got the wrong guy.

912
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,360
不是巴比
It's not Bobby.

913
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:04,430
阿呆
Doofy!

914
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:05,360
不是他
No, it isn't.

915
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,530
你是谁？
Who is this?

916
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,850
喂？
Hello?

917
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,490
说过我清理房间时别来烦我的
I said don't disturb me while I'm cleaning my room!

918
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:32,660
听说巴比今早获释了
I heard Bobby got out this morning.

919
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,990
我没看到他
I haven't seen him around.

920
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,320
他生气吗？
Is he pissed?

921
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:39,060
你是说你诬指他是凶手？
You mean since you branded him the Candyman?

922
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,790
不，他伤心死了
No, his heart is broken.

923
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:44,200
这场景有点似曾相识呢
Yo, son. It's like I seen this all before.

924
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,670
你以前的学校有杀手？
They had a killer at your old school?

925
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:49,470
不，很像“惊声尖叫”
No, it was in this movie Scream. Same dialogue and everything.

926
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:50,540
真糟糕
This is ill.

927
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:51,840
结局怎样？
How did it end?

928
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:52,350
不知道
I don't know.

929
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,580
有黑鬼在电影院里火拼
Some niggas started shooing up in the movie theater,

930
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,150
没错
so we just broke out. No doubt.

931
00:42:57,490 --> 00:43:01,790
好吧，今晚到我家集合
Okay, I say we all just stick together. Tonight everyone meet at my house.

932
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:02,850
带些朋友来
And bring some friends.

933
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:04,620
别四处张扬
But don't tell everyone, okay?

934
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,590
口风紧一点
Try to keep it quiet.

935
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,460
辛蒂家开派对
Party at Cindy's house!

936
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:12,100
大家有得乱搞了
Drunk white women for everybody!

937
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:18,100
要是看到巴比，跟他说我爱他
If you see Bobby, tell him I love him.

938
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,800
好
Okay. If I see Bobby,

939
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,580
我会说我爱他
I'll tell him I love him.

940
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:30,980
天啊
Jesus.

941
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,550
没关系，是我，宝贝
It's all right, it's just me, baby.

942
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,290
你还认为是我？
You don't still think it's me?

943
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:35,790
不
No.

944
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,620
但的确有人想杀我
But somebody did try to kill me.

945
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,490
警方说我吓跑他了
And the police said I scared him away.

946
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:40,360
我知道
I know.

947
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,060
他昨晚打电话给我
He called me last night.

948
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,290
看吧，不可能是我
You see, it couldn't have been me.

949
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:45,030
我被关着
I was in jail last night.

950
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:49,300
你真行
You're the best.

951
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:50,930
抱歉
I'm sorry.

952
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,700
请你体谅
Please understand.

953
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:55,640
体谅你把我当成凶手？
Understand that you'd rather call me a killer than touch me?

954
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:56,400
不是的
That's not true.

955
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:57,570
那你是怎么了？
Then what is it? What is it?

956
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:00,270
她走了，她不会再回来了
She's gone and she's not coming back!

957
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,970
已经一年多了，辛蒂
It's been over a year, Cindy.

958
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,590
但辣妹合唱团不能没有她
But Ginger was such an important part of the Spice Girls.

959
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:06,650
日子还是要过的
You got to move on, baby.

960
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,590
抱歉我的生活太复杂了
I'm sorry if my complicated life...

961
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:14,320
这对你实在不公平
...is an inconvenience to your perfect existence.

962
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,430
大家听清楚了
Okay, everybody, listen up.

963
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,290
我这么说吧...
Let me just say...

964
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,130
这些青少年被杀，实在是悲剧
...the killing of these teenagers has been tragic,

965
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,880
坏事总是年年有
but...you know, shit happens.

966
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:31,480
警长，警长
Sheriff!. Sheriff!.

967
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:33,540
是的，找碴小姐
Yes, Miss Thunderstorm.

968
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:35,850
找到辛蒂的父亲了吗？
Have they found Cindy Campbell's father?

969
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:37,880
他不是嫌犯？
Isn't he a suspect?

970
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:39,040
这是机密
That is classified information.

971
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:40,120
你怎么知道？
Where are you getting that?

972
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:41,280
抱歉
I'm sorry,

973
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,120
我不能透露资讯来源
but my sources are strictly confidential,sheriff.

974
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:45,360
嗨，盖儿
Hey, Gail.

975
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,660
盖儿爱吃小弟弟
Gail swallows.

976
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:56,600
看着.是谁？
Who is this?

977
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:01,840
什么？
What?

978
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,110
你想杀我？
You want to kill me?

979
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,840
等等
Oh, God. Hold on.

980
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,480
辛蒂，找你的
Cindy, it's for you.

981
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:17,320
别捉弄辛蒂了，帕妃
All right, knock it off, Buffy.

982
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,130
你们都听说过...
Now, as you all have heard...

983
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,250
镇上有凶手
...a killer is in town

984
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,230
警方给了我们一些安全准则
and the police have asked us to give you safety tips;

985
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:25,590
待在灯光明亮的地方
Stay in well-lit areas.

986
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,100
不要单独旅行
Do not travel alone whenever possible.

987
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:30,740
卫生纸由前往后擦
Always wipe front to back.

988
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,270
记住...
And remember;

989
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:33,740
千万不要相信别人
Never, ever believe someone...

990
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:38,310
尤其是想帮你刮毛的人
...who says that shaving your pubic hair will rid you of crab infestation.

991
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,750
我知道你们很难过
Now, I understand this is a difficult time for you young ladies.

992
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:46,590
如果有人想找我谈
So if anyone needs to come to my office to talk...

993
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:48,350
到办公室找我
...I am here for you.

994
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:54,490
一堆屁话
What a crock of shit.

995
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:55,820
才不是呢
It's not, Buffy!

996
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:57,630
他是当真的
He's real!

997
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:09,880
木兰老师？
Miss Mann?

998
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:13,480
请进
Come in, dear.

999
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:14,280
请坐
Have a seat.

1000
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:15,610
把胸罩脱了吧
Take off your bra if you'd like.

1001
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:18,880
不，谢了
No, thanks.

1002
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,090
需要我帮忙吗？
What can I do for you, Cindy?

1003
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:24,350
我需要谈谈
I need to talk.

1004
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:26,280
我有个问题
See, I have this problem...

1005
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:28,400
我不知该跟谁说
...and I don't know who to tell.

1006
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:31,530
感觉很不清爽？
Not feeling so fresh?

1007
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,300
阴道发痒？
Feminine odor and itching got you down?

1008
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:39,070
不，不是的
No, not that.

1009
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,370
那是什么？
Then what is it?

1010
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:44,540
我有个恐怖的秘密
I have a terrible secret.

1011
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,850
人都有秘密的
Well, we all have our little secret.

1012
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,710
有时我们会做些不光彩的事
Sometimes we do things we're not proud of.

1013
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:55,850
有些人为钱
Some for money...

1014
00:46:57,290 --> 00:46:59,690
有些人是为了测试自己的极限
...others to gain the athletic edge on them

1015
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:03,190
这些秘密有时会反噬我们
Sometimes those secrets come back to haunt.

1016
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:05,320
知道我的意思吗？
Do you know what I mean?

1017
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:08,530
我知道
Yes, I do, Miss Mann.

1018
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:09,400
谢谢蛋蛋...
Thanks for ball....

1019
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:11,660
我是指，你的协助
I mean, all your help.

1020
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:13,100
我得去上课了
I have to go to class.

1021
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:15,930
随时欢迎你
Anytime, dear.

1022
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:20,410
帕妃，要来吗？
Buffy, are you coming?

1023
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,080
我马上到
I'll catch up with you guys in a sec.

1024
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:29,760
死神到了
Redrum.

1025
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:32,750
你好？
Hello?

1026
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,170
有人吗？
Somebody there?

1027
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:45,100
你好？
Hello?

1028
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,210
真可笑
Very funny.

1029
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,210
谁叫你打扮成这样？辛蒂？
Who put you up to this? Cindy?

1030
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:56,010
披风脱掉
Lose the cape.

1031
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:57,280
太老套了
It's a way too ninties-horror.

1032
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:02,050
这是哪部电影的情节？
So what movie is this from?

1033
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,480
啦啦队长之死？
Die Cheerleader, Die?

1034
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:08,220
想演变态凶手？
Want to play psycho killer?

1035
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,630
那我演无助的啦啦队长吧？
Can I be the helpless cheerleader?

1036
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,000
那我该求你放过我罗？
So is this where I'm supposed to beg for my life?

1037
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:19,870
求求你，凶手先生，别杀我
Please, Mr. Killer, don't kill me.

1038
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,310
我该在这里流血？
So this is when I'm approved bleed?

1039
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:29,240
看，我流血了
Oh, look, I'm bleeding.

1040
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,450
我该逃了，对吧？
I'm supposed to run, right?

1041
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:41,620
我在逃，我在逃了，救命
I'm running! I'm running! Help!

1042
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,790
现在我该跌断腿，孤立无援
Now I'm going to fall and break my leg,leaving me helpless.

1043
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:50,400
好了，凶手先生
There you go, Mr. Scary killer.

1044
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:52,240
我很慌了
I'm panicking now.

1045
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,440
天啊，快来人救救我
God, somebody please help me!

1046
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:58,640
天啊，不
Oh, God, no.

1047
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,940
现在呢？
Oh, now what?

1048
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,080
我想这是全片高潮了
I guess this is the big climax.

1049
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:08,450
希望你不会觉得我演太假了
Hope you don't mind if I fake it.

1050
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,150
看看我
Oh, look at me.

1051
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,130
我死了
I'm all dead.

1052
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:17,230
我是颗恶心的头颅
I'm a gross, scary severed head.

1053
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:18,920
拜托
Come on. Please.

1054
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:20,560
知道是谁吗？
Do you know who I am?

1055
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:21,190
我是妙龄小姐
I'm Miss Teen.

1056
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:22,860
你让我的头好痛
You're really giving me a headache.

1057
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:25,100
你把我的古奇T恤染上血了
You got blood all over my Gucci sweater.

1058
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,840
希望你会付出代价
I hope you're going to pay for that.

1059
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:29,700
“失物招领”
LOST & FOUND

1060
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:32,080
我要跳了
I'm going to jump!

1061
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:33,140
菲尔
Phil!

1062
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,370
回来
Get backing there!

1063
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,010
不
No!

1064
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:36,450
你在上面干嘛？
What are you doing up there?

1065
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:37,640
理智点
Be reasonable.

1066
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:43,450
我不要再教这些白烂学生了
I can't take this fucking job or those greasy shithead teenagers anymore!

1067
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:45,120
我要结束这一切
I'm going to end it all!

1068
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:46,630
等等
Wait! Hold on!

1069
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,460
我们正在找人帮忙
We're getting help for you.

1070
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:50,220
凶手不是巴比
Now we know Bobby's not the killer.

1071
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:51,260
那是谁？
So who is?

1072
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,260
不知道
I don't know.

1073
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,330
昨晚凶手在你家为何不杀你？
If the killer was in your house last night,

1074
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:55,900
他只想耍我们
why didn't he kill you then?

1075
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,870
而他也的确达到目的了
Because he's just messing with us. Don't you see?

1076
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:01,840
我们不能找警察
He's got us right where he wants us. We can't go to the police.

1077
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:05,070
他正在等着我们
He's just out there... watching us and waiting for us.

1078
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:08,150
你还在等什么？
What are you waiting for?!

1079
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:11,380
你还等什么？
What are you waiting for?

1080
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,990
你还等什么？
What are you waiting for?!

1081
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:16,350
我还等什么？
What am I waiting for?

1082
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:18,250
我还等什么？
What am I waiting for?!

1083
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:20,120
你还等什么？
What are you waiting for?!

1084
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:21,520
去你妈的
Fuck you!

1085
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:25,130
我的老天
Oh, my God.

1086
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,970
我还是不认为开派对是好主意
I still don't think this party is a good idea.

1087
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,070
我会保护你的
You know I won't let nothing happen to you.

1088
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:32,810
我只是觉得有危险
I just don't feel right.

1089
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:34,930
我们为何不能做点别的？
Why can't we just do something else?

1090
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:36,940
去看电影吧？
How about we go to the movies?

1091
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:39,340
你喜欢看电影？
You like that?

1092
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:46,650
我最喜欢这首歌
See a little movie? That is my song!

1093
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,580
我还有机会在里面叫几声呢
You know they gave me a shout out on the album, right?

1094
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:50,190
什么？
What?

1095
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:50,820
没错
Yes.

1096
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,950
不管走到哪，我都看到那贱人
Everywhere I go I see the same ho.

1097
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:59,360
你穿我的运动衣很性感
Brenda.Did I tell you how sexy you look in my jersey?

1098
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:00,960
真的？
I do, Ray?

1099
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:01,830
没错
Yes.

1100
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:03,960
我喜欢
I like it. Get up.

1101
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:05,510
过来点，让我看看
Go over there. Let me see it.

1102
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:13,070
继续
Go ahead.

1103
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:14,010
好耶，我喜欢
Yes. I like that.

1104
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,880
你喜欢？你喜欢？
You like that? You like that?

1105
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:18,650
把这穿上
Put this on with it.

1106
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:22,390
小雷，你真怪
Ray, you are so freaky.

1107
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:23,080
没错
That's right.

1108
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:24,660
我是大变态
You know I'm a freaky guy.

1109
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,420
继续
Go on.

1110
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,960
穿好
Pull it up, pull it up.

1111
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:31,400
来
Here, here.

1112
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:32,630
把这戴上
Put this on with it.

1113
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:34,860
快啊
Go on.

1114
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:37,430
你确定？
Are you sure?

1115
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:42,340
快啊，戴上
Go on, girl, go on. Pull it on.

1116
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,240
快啊
Go on.

1117
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,570
我喜欢
I like that look.

1118
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:49,280
我很坏的
I'm bad.

1119
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:49,910
是啊
Ah, yes.

1120
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:51,280
来，把这戴上
Here, put this on with it.

1121
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:54,520
快啊，戴上它
Go on, girl. Put it on.

1122
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:57,680
快，把那玩意戴上
Here. That shit on there. Come on.

1123
00:51:57,830 --> 00:51:58,920
用力戴
Just shove it on.

1124
00:51:59,060 --> 00:51:59,490
快戴啊
Do it.

1125
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:02,600
好耶，真性感
Yeah. So fucking sexy.

1126
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:03,350
过来
Come here, girl.

1127
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,160
性感的小屁屁
Bring your little sexy ass here.

1128
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:09,200
用力给我抱抱
Come on! Full speed, charge1

1129
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,960
快啊，转过来
Yes! Come on! Turn around!

1130
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:13,900
转过来
Turn around! Come on1

1131
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,240
好耶，接招吧，布兰蛋
Yes, Brendan. Take it, Brendan.Take it, Brendan!

1132
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:18,510
谁？
Who?

1133
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,010
布兰妲，快，把安全帽戴上
Brenda. Come on, put the helmet on.

1134
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,050
不，来玩角色扮演
No, let's role-play.

1135
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:25,210
快，换你来上我
Come on. You get me. Get me. Come on.

1136
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:27,480
我正在幽会停车场
I'm here at Lover's Lookout.

1137
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,920
这里很黑，很偏僻
It's dark, it's in the middle of nowhere...

1138
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:32,790
那些青少年就爱来这里爽
...and it's where hormone-driven teens love to come and fool around.

1139
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:35,990
我们应该能看到有人被杀
So very likely we're about to see someone get killed.

1140
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:39,170
那车里有个女孩
Sure enough, there's a girl in that car,

1141
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,460
上衣松开
blouse unbuttoned, all alone.

1142
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,130
看看她有没有话要说
Let's see if she'll have a word with us.

1143
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:44,230
嗨，我是盖儿
Hi. Gail Hailstorm.

1144
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:46,640
新书“下一个就是你”的作者
Author of the new book You're Next.

1145
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:49,910
你叫什么名字？
Can you tell us your name?

1146
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,510
希瑟
My name's Heather.

1147
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:54,010
告诉我们你为何一个人在此？
Can you tell us what you're doing here all alone?

1148
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,350
好，没问题
Well, yeah, sure.

1149
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:58,920
我男友和我来这里玩耍
My boyfriend and I were just, like, making out...

1150
00:52:59,050 --> 00:52:59,920
接着我们听到声音
...and then we heard a noise,

1151
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:02,050
他去查探
so he went to go check, but...

1152
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:04,020
那是十分种前的事了
...that was, like, ten minutes ago.

1153
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:07,950
你想他是不是遇害了...
Has it crossed your little mind that your boyfriend was probably murdered...

1154
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,660
而你就是下一个？
...and you're about to be slaughtered next?

1155
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:14,130
真的？不可能
Really? No way.

1156
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:16,000
好，祝好运
Way. Good luck.

1157
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:17,570
谢了，你真优秀
Thanks. You're the best.

1158
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:18,670
我知道
I know.

1159
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:19,930
正如我所想
Just as I thought.

1160
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,940
凶手已经出现
The murder is happening as we speak!

1161
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,670
我会设法拍下凶案过程，准备
I'll try and break into the bloodshed! Are you getting this?!

1162
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:26,080
抱歉
Excuse me. Heather,

1163
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,380
请问你现在感觉如何？
can you tell us what you're feeling,honey?

1164
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,580
很痛
Lots of pain.

1165
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,280
救救我
Gail, please help me!

1166
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:32,350
救救我
Gail, please!

1167
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:33,010
我很想救你

01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:28,650
我一直都太自私了
I have been so selfish.

1313
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:33,560
这好像某部电影的片段
This is like a scene from movie or something.

1314
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,630
但这不是电影，巴比
Only it isn't a movie, Bobby.

1315
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:37,590
这是真的
This is real life.

1316
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:41,060
这是部电影
It's all a movie, baby.

1317
01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:43,260
收音师在那
There's the sound guy.

1318
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:44,770
工作人员都在
There's the script supervisor.

1319
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:46,640
你们好吗？
How you doing, baby?

1320
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:47,500
干嘛？
What?

1321
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:49,940
我指的是...
What I mean...

1322
01:02:51,550 --> 01:02:53,070
在真实生活中
...is that in real life,

1323
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:56,050
你得享受一切
you have to enjoy each moment.

1324
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:32,220
我能跟你讲个秘密吗？
Can I tell you a secret?

1325
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:34,810
说吧
Sure, man.

1326
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:38,660
我看得见鬼魂
I see dead people.

1327
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:43,530
哇，这玩意炫呆了
Man, this shit is awesome!

1328
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:47,300
你该多卷一点来抽
Yo, son, you got to roll some more of that shit!

1329
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,070
但我们没烟纸了
Huh, son? But we don't have any more papers, man.

1330
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,510
我们没烟纸了
We don't have any more papers.

1331
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:56,410
我们可以用水管干嘛？
Oh, man. Now, what can we use to make a bong?

1332
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:04,350
吸，吸吸
Toke, toke, toke.

1333
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:15,120
妈的
Oh, shit, son.

1334
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:22,600
这玩意酷毙了
This some good shit.

1335
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:49,690
巴比
Bobby.

1336
01:04:49,830 --> 01:04:50,060
怎么？
What?

1337
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,220
我没有做过
I've never done this before.

1338
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,830
没关系
It's okay. It's okay.

1339
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:56,070
那就像...
It's just like...

1340
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:58,170
那就像在吃棒棒糖
It's like sucking on a Tootsie Roll Pop.

1341
01:04:58,310 --> 01:04:59,200
棒棒糖？
A Tootsie Pop?

1342
01:04:59,470 --> 01:05:01,170
对，樱桃口味的
Yeah. A cherry-flavor one.

1343
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,570
中间有软糖的那种
With the fudge in the middle.

1344
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:14,310
好耶，就是这样
Oh, yeah, just like that.

1345
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:15,790
就是这样
Just like that, baby.

1346
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:23,060
天啊
Oh! Jesus!

1347
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:27,100
我每次都等不及就用咬的
I never could wait to get to the chewy middle.

1348
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:29,640
让我来吧
You know what? Let me.

1349
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:32,500
哇咧
Goddamn.

1350
01:05:58,270 --> 01:06:00,230
已经很久了
Guess it's been a while.

1351
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:12,240
你的毛真劲爆
It's very seventies of you.

1352
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:37,330
快，巴比，我要
Come here, Bobby! I want it now!

1353
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:40,970
天啊，我爽呆了
Aw, man, am I fucking stoned.

1354
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:43,110
我也是
Yeah, me too , son.

1355
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:44,400
你们听见了吗？
Hey, you guys hear that?

1356
01:07:02,130 --> 01:07:02,560
喂？
Hello?

1357
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:03,960
你好
Hello.

1358
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:06,970
你最喜欢哪部恐怖片？
What's your favorite scary movie?

1359
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:17,330
我要把你的内脏都挖出来
I'm going to gut you like a pig.

1360
01:07:27,890 --> 01:07:29,650
我是谁，巴比？
What's my name, Bobby?!

1361
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:30,780
什么？
What?

1362
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:33,160
我是谁，贱人
What's my name?! Bitch!

1363
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:34,960
是辛蒂
God , it's Cindy!

1364
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:36,590
谁最行，巴比？
Whose is it, Bobby?

1365
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:37,960
谁最行，巴比？
Whose is it, Bobby?!

1366
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,460
是你
It's yours.

1367
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:46,500
我的天啊
Oh, my God!

1368
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:55,610
妈的
Oh, shit!!

1369
01:07:58,920 --> 01:07:59,480
别自己脱
Don't even contest

1370
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:00,750
我会逼你脱
because I'll make you undress.

1371
01:08:00,890 --> 01:08:03,410
就像脱衣舞娘等着跳脱衣舞
Like porn dancers waiting at the front door for an answer.

1372
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:06,590
我讨厌矽胶的大奶子
I'm sick of artificial MCs like silicone titties.

1373
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,330
注意了
Hey, yo, check it. Fuck a cheap ball

1374
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:11,020
我要去吸高品质的草
I'm going to smoke Cheech and Chong.

1375
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:12,190
想要持久
If you want to fuck long,

1376
01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:13,990
我就吸更多
I'll let my ding-a-long hit the bong.

1377
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:14,830
接着唱...
And then the song;

1378
01:08:14,970 --> 01:08:16,300
烟管一定要往左传
Always pass the dutchie to the left.

1379
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,100
因为往右传是大错特错
Because the right way is wrong.

1380
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:21,540
有了
I got one.

1381
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,670
有了
I got one, I got one.

1382
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:24,180
我要唱了
Here is goes. Ready?

1383
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:25,210
我要砍死，切死你
I'm going to slash and gash.

1384
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:26,210
挖穿你屁屁
Cut another hole in your ass.

1385
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:28,470
我要拿你的蛋蛋当球打
I spill blood on the walls then play tennis with your balls.

1386
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:29,540
电话响了
If the phone rings,

1387
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:30,650
可别接
don't answer the call.

1388
01:08:30,790 --> 01:08:32,650
切开你的喉咙，搞死你
Going to slit your throat. Fuck you like a goat.

1389
01:08:32,790 --> 01:08:34,950
剥了你的皮来做大衣
Peel your foreskin off and make a winter coat.

1390
01:08:35,090 --> 01:08:36,250
和平
Peace

1391
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:45,220
这是我听过最棒的了
That was the illest rhyme I ever see, son!

1392
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:51,100
你今晚本来在哪里？
Where were you tonight?

1393
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:55,970
我只是好奇
I was just curious.

1394
01:08:56,110 --> 01:08:57,810
你怎么拖这么久才来？
What took you so long to get here?

1395
01:08:57,950 --> 01:08:58,840
你怎么这么好奇？
Why are you so curious?

1396
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:01,780
我不知道
I don't know.

1397
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:05,490
我以为会跟烂恐怖片一样...
I thought it would fit the nineties-horror clich.

1398
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:08,050
结果你才是凶手
if...you turned out to be the killer.

1399
01:09:08,790 --> 01:09:10,760
你认为是我杀了帕妃和格瑞？
So wait.You think I killed Buffy and Gerg?

1400
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,390
帕妃和格瑞死了？
Buffy and Greg are dead?

1401
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:17,290
我以为你知道
I thought you knew that.

1402
01:09:17,670 --> 01:09:18,430
天啊
Oh, my God.

1403
01:09:18,570 --> 01:09:19,560
巴比，转过身去
Bobby, turn around!

1404
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:20,730
是凶手
It's the killer!

1405
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:38,920
天啊，巴比
Oh, my God. Bobby.

1406
01:09:40,290 --> 01:09:41,280
救救我
Help me.

1407
01:09:42,290 --> 01:09:43,480
宝贝，没事了
Bobby, it's okay.

1408
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:46,250
把枪给我
Give me the gun.

1409
01:09:46,830 --> 01:09:48,090
你不会有事的
It's going to be okay, Bob.

1410
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:51,330
等等我
Yo, wait for me!

1411
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:53,500
凶手在这里
There's a killer in the house!

1412
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:55,630
到处都是血
There's ass, blood and guts everywhere!

1413
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:57,800
有人发疯了
Someone done gone crazy, son!

1414
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:01,410
我们多少都会发疯的
We all go a little crazy sometimes.

1415
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:02,640
巴比，不
Bobby, no!!

1416
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:06,440
妈的
Oh, shit, son!

1417
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:08,940
我的天
Oh, my God.

1418
01:10:11,190 --> 01:10:13,680
他射中我胸口
They shot me in the lungs.

1419
01:10:15,790 --> 01:10:17,160
想吸一口吗？
You want to hit this shit?

1420
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:23,120
蕃茄酱
Ketchup.

1421
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,360
我妈做意大利面就只放这个
Just like my mom puts on her spaghetti, baby.

1422
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:29,330
天啊，小雷
Oh, ma God, Ray.

1423
01:10:29,470 --> 01:10:29,960
你得帮我
You got to help me.

1424
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:30,930
巴比疯了
Bobby's gone crazy!

1425
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:33,930
惊喜
Surprise.

1426
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:37,200
惊喜，辛蒂
Surprise, Cindy.

1427
01:10:50,190 --> 01:10:52,180
你为何这么做？
Why are you doing this, Bobby?

1428
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:53,020
为什么？
Why?

1429
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:54,060
为什么？
Why?

1430
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:56,060
听见吗
You hear that, Ray?

1431
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,190
她要动机
I think she wants a motive.

1432
01:10:58,470 --> 01:10:59,760
“惊声尖叫”有什么剧情？
Did Scream have a plot?

1433
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:00,870
没有
No.

1434
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,870
“是谁搞的鬼”也烂毙了
Did I know What You Did Last Summer make any sense?

1435
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:05,900
我不这么想
Don't think so.

1436
01:11:06,370 --> 01:11:08,810
续集里干嘛多了个牙买加白痴
And what was with that fat white Jamaican kid in the sequel?

1437
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:10,170
我想杀了他
I want to kill that fucker.

1438
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:10,870
我也是
Me too.

1439
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:12,480
演员太烂了
It was bad casting, Bobby.

1440
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:14,810
我觉得根本没激情场面
How about this for motive? Lack of sex!

1441
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:18,380
那会导致变态行为
It can cause serious deviant behavior.

1442
01:11:19,050 --> 01:11:20,450
我以为你爱我
I thought you loved me.

1443
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:22,280
我爱的
Oh, I did, baby.

1444
01:11:22,690 --> 01:11:23,550
我爱的
I did.

1445
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:26,490
但禁欲后能让你重新发掘自己
But abstinence can make you discover new things about yourself.

1446
01:11:26,930 --> 01:11:29,260
辛蒂，我是同志
That's right, Cindy. I'm gay.

1447
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:31,300
万一你没注意
And in case you haven't noticed,

1448
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:32,130
小雷也是
so is Ray.

1449
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,930
什么？我才不是
What? I ain't gay.

1450
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:37,700
那你为何带我到俱乐部去？
But you took me to that club.

1451
01:11:37,970 --> 01:11:39,560
那又怎样？那里音乐好听啊
So? They play good music.

1452
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:42,270
去旧金山的事呢？
What about our trip to San Francisco?

1453
01:11:42,610 --> 01:11:43,670
我想去购物
I wanted to go shopping.

1454
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:47,280
但你跟我做爱了
But you made love to me.

1455
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:49,350
不，是你舔我弟弟
No. You sucked my dick.

1456
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:51,010
我不想谈了
I don't want to talk about this now.

1457
01:11:51,150 --> 01:11:53,250
我要丢下一切
The point is... I'm a new man

1458
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:56,020
开始新生
and I'm ready to leave all this behind and start a new life.

1459
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,920
你要杀了你所有的朋友？
So you kill all your friends?

1460
01:11:58,790 --> 01:11:59,520
没有
Oh, no.

1461
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:00,860
只有你
Just you.

1462
01:12:01,630 --> 01:12:02,390
还有矮子
And maybe Shorty,

1463
01:12:02,530 --> 01:12:04,360
但那不是预谋
but that wasn't planned or anything.

1464
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:05,830
最天才的部份是...
But here's the genius part.

1465
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:09,470
我们模仿真正的杀人凶手
We're copycatting a serial killer that already exists.

1466
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:11,260
这是完全犯罪
It's the perfect crime.

1467
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:14,340
等等，还有
But wait! There's more!

1468
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:16,100
坐稳了
Hang on to your seat, baby.

1469
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:18,470
这可有趣了
Because this one's a screamer!

1470
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:20,880
我马上回来
I'll be back.

1471
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:24,650
你快去...
Get your big ass...

1472
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:26,480
爸
Dad!

1473
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:28,980
你想干嘛？
What are you going to do?

1474
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:29,780
诬陷他？
Frame him?

1475
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:33,750
不，我们要玩玩你老爸
No. we're just having a little bit of fun with old daddio.

1476
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:37,660
警方会发现你跟你爸都死了
The police are going to find you and Daddy both dead...

1477
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,730
我和小雷是唯一的生还者
...and me and Ray the only survivors of a maniac's revenge.

1478
01:12:41,470 --> 01:12:41,990
准备好了？
You ready?

1479
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:42,860
好了吗？我好了
You ready? I'm ready.

1480
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,470
我好了，动手吧
I'm ready. Let's do this.

1481
01:12:45,410 --> 01:12:46,070
来吧
Come on.

1482
01:12:46,210 --> 01:12:46,640
好
All right.

1483
01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:47,210
快啊
Come.

1484
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:50,740
快刺我
Give it to me.

1485
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:54,480
等等，等等
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

1486
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:55,170
好了？
Ready?

1487
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:55,710
好了，等等
All right, wait.

1488
01:12:55,850 --> 01:12:57,780
动手吧
Let's do this. Come on.

1489
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:58,650
好了，好了
Ready. Ready.

1490
01:12:58,790 --> 01:12:59,580
快，快刺我
Come on! Give it to me!

1491
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:00,580
等等
Wait!

1492
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:01,480
我们说好的
You remember what we talked about?

1493
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:02,550
你要提几次？
How often will you go over it?

1494
01:13:02,690 --> 01:13:03,950
我知道的，别再提了
I know, okay? Stop. All right?

1495
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:07,320
相信我，我知道我在干嘛
Trust me, okay? I got this shit. Ready?

1496
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:10,360
等等
Wait!

1497
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:13,400
等？我要割穿你喉咙了
What? I'm about to cut your throat!

1498
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:14,760
别装了，快点
Stop acting like a little girl. Come on!

1499
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:15,390
你说的对
You're right.

1500
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:16,300
好了？
Ready?

1501
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:18,060
我好了，来吧
I'm ready. Come on!

1502
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:20,730
你们真变态
You guys are psychos!

1503
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:23,410
你们看太多电视了
You've seen one too many TV shows!

1504
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:24,470
不
No!

1505
01:13:24,850 --> 01:13:27,680
看电视节目不会造就变态杀手
Watching television shows doesn't create psycho killers!

1506
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,580
取消电视节目才会
Canceling TV shows does!

1507
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:33,050
吴宗宪的节目就超炫
The Wayans Brothers was a good-ass show, man!

1508
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:37,620
我们连最后一集都没得录
And we didn't even get a final episode!

1509
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:38,120
别刺我了
Take it easy.

1510
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:40,250
我有点想吐了
I'm feeling a little woozy here.

1511
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:42,020
该我了
It's my turn.

1512
01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:43,720
把刀给我
Give me the knife.

1513
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:44,970
想都别想
Fuck out of here.

1514
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:46,760
没人能拿刀砍我
Ain't nobody stabbing me.

1515
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:56,470
惊喜，辛蒂
Surprise, Cindy.

1516
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:50,460
很好
All right.

1517
01:14:52,470 --> 01:14:53,190
等等
Hold on a second.

1518
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:54,930
我休息一下
Just give me a moment.

1519
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:58,100
一下就好
One moment.

1520
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:03,810
好了
Yeah. That's it.

1521
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:05,340
可以了
All right. Okay.

1522
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:42,980
爸
Dad.

1523
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:45,410
你还好吧？
Are you okay?

1524
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:47,580
我说过我在家才能开派对的
I thought I told you not to have a party unless I was here.

1525
01:15:48,490 --> 01:15:49,620
你在啊
But you were here.

1526
01:15:50,090 --> 01:15:51,150
你在衣柜里
You were in the closet.

1527
01:15:51,290 --> 01:15:51,950
没错
Yeah, that's right.

1528
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:54,120
帮我要到女生电话了？
Did you get some girlfriends' numbers for me?

1529
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:55,790
她们都死了
Dad, they're dead.

1530
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:57,790
我老是不走运
You know, I can't get a break.

1531
01:15:58,270 --> 01:15:59,600
那是什么？警察吗？
What's that? Is that the cops?

1532
01:16:00,330 --> 01:16:02,000
听着
Okay, listen, honey.

1533
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:03,260
扶我起来
Help me up now.

1534
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:05,960
告诉警察我是水电工
If the cops come, tell them I'm a plumber,okay?

1535
01:16:06,110 --> 01:16:08,840
你的水龙头坏了，我来修
You had a leaky faucet and they sent me over.

1536
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:10,100
我们根本不认识
We don't even know each other.

1537
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:17,040
不
No!!

1538
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,010
爸，把手放下
Dad, get your arms down.

1539
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:24,960
怎么回事？
What the hell's going on?

1540
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:26,150
里面一片血海
It's a bloodbath in there.

1541
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:28,260
他本来在这里，我发誓
He was right here! I swear!

1542
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:28,960
谁？
Who was?

1543
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:30,030
凶手
The killer!

1544
01:16:30,430 --> 01:16:32,400
那家伙杀光了我朋友
The guy that murdered all my friends!

1545
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:36,530
那混蛋还在屋里藏毒品
And the sick bastard planted drugs in the house.

1546
01:16:36,670 --> 01:16:37,360
到处都是
All over the place.

1547
01:16:38,770 --> 01:16:39,240
爸，别说了
Dad. Stop it.

1548
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:41,370
我得带你回警局
I'll have to take you down to the station.

1549
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:43,480
我没事吧？
I'm cool, though, right?

1550
01:16:44,450 --> 01:16:45,040
我没事吧？
I'm okay?

1551
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:46,040
走吧，辛蒂
Let's go, Cindy.

1552
01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:49,470
打电话给我
Call me. Call me.

1553
01:16:50,850 --> 01:16:52,410
老爸会保你出来的
Daddy'll get you out.

1554
01:16:57,490 --> 01:16:58,750
再重头来过吧
Let's go over this again.

1555
01:17:11,410 --> 01:17:12,390
你说那是意外
You say it was an accident.

1556
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:13,170
对
Yes.

1557
01:17:13,310 --> 01:17:14,330
他在路上
He was on the road.

1558
01:17:14,910 --> 01:17:16,430
你想他是回来报？
And you think he came back for revenge?

1559
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:17,840
一定是他，警长
It has to be him, sheriff.

1560
01:17:25,290 --> 01:17:27,310
警长，他们要我把这交给你
Sheriff, they want me to get this to you.

1561
01:17:27,690 --> 01:17:29,620
好了，阿呆
That'll be all, Doofy.

1562
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,050
我要走了
I'm going to go, then.

1563
01:17:31,190 --> 01:17:31,890
好
All right.

1564
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:35,290
拜，辛蒂
Bye, Cind.

1565
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:39,660
抱歉，辛蒂
I'm sorry, Cindy.

1566
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:41,390
不是那个人
It wasn't the man you guys killed.

1567
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:43,070
他叫奇大卫
His name was David Keegan.

1568
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,670
一个渔夫发现他的尸体了
A fisherman found his body a few weeks later.

1569
01:17:45,810 --> 01:17:46,670
他被埋在湖林墓园
He's buried in Lakewood Cemetery.

1570
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:48,670
不可能
That's impossible.

1571
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:51,740
那我真的不知是谁了
Then I don't know who it could be.

1572
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:56,480
一定是个知道所有事件的人
It's got to be someone connected to all the victims who knew about the accident.

1573
01:17:56,620 --> 01:17:59,050
一个不被人注意的人
Someone who could move around without being noticed.

1574
01:17:59,190 --> 01:18:05,060
我的天
Oh, my God.

1575
01:18:05,190 --> 01:18:06,850
她照顾过我弟阿呆
She used to babysit my brother, Doofy.

1576
01:18:07,030 --> 01:18:08,090
他爱她
He had the biggest crush on her.

1577
01:18:10,130 --> 01:18:10,930
是我，，辛蒂
It's me, Cind.

1578
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:13,270
晚安，辛蒂
Night, Cind.

1579
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:16,100
“阿呆”
DOOFUS PORCELAIN

1580
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:18,300
阿呆
Doofy!

1581
01:18:18,810 --> 01:18:19,640
那个白痴？
Shithead?

1582
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:23,670
有看到阿呆吗？
Have you seen Doofy?

1583
01:18:23,810 --> 01:18:24,180
没有
No.

1584
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:24,830
有看到阿呆吗？
Have you seen Doofy?

1585
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:25,600
没有
No, sheriff.

1586
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:26,740
有人看到阿呆吗？
Has anybody seen Doofy?

1587
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:27,610
没有
No.

1588
01:18:28,050 --> 01:18:30,780
他刚从后门走了，警长
Yeah, he just went out the back, sheriff.

1589
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:29,300
不！
No!!

1590
01:19:42,790 --> 01:19:44,660
妈的，你好吗？
Shit, son. Yo, what the deal?

1591
01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:47,220
你们如果正在看这部片子
Yo, if y'all watching this tape right now...

1592
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:49,460
那表示我没成功
...that means I didn't make it.

1593
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:52,460
我不是被关，就是...
Either I'm a prisoner or worse.

1594
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:53,700
死了
Dead.

1595
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:55,190
不管怎样
But either way it goes.

1596
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:58,030
我要告诉各位生存法则
I tell you all the rules to survive this situation.

1597
01:19:58,510 --> 01:20:01,200
第一，动作要快
Rule number one; You got to be quick.

1598
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:04,770
第二，别跌倒
