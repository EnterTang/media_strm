1
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,671
安东尼?霍普金斯

2
00:01:07,131 --> 00:01:09,842
艾玛?汤普森

3
00:01:12,345 --> 00:01:14,430
詹姆斯?福克斯

4
00:01:16,516 --> 00:01:18,601
克里斯托弗?里弗

5
00:01:19,644 --> 00:01:22,772
告别有情天

6
00:01:23,825 --> 00:01:25,191
亲爱的史蒂文斯先生
Dear Mr. Stevens

7
00:01:25,535 --> 00:01:28,778
过了这么久收到我的来信  可能让你很惊讶
You will be surprised to hear from me after all this time.

8
00:01:29,038 --> 00:01:31,756
自从我听闻达林顿公爵死后
You've been in my thoughts

9
00:01:31,757 --> 00:01:33,115
我就一直想起你
since I heard Lord Darlington had died.

10
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:36,901
我们听说他的继承人要把达林顿府邸拍卖
We read that his heirs put Darlington Hall up for sale

11
00:01:37,255 --> 00:01:39,455
因为他们一点也不想保留这房子
as they no longer wished to maintain it.

12
00:01:39,758 --> 00:01:43,616
报纸上也写道  既然没有人想买这样一座大宅邸
As no one would buy such a large house

13
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:46,531
于是新继承者决定把它拆解
the new earl decided to demolish it

14
00:01:46,532 --> 00:01:48,871
以5000英镑的价格卖掉
and sell the stone for 5000 pounds.

15
00:01:49,601 --> 00:01:51,879
我也在每日邮报里看到一些
We also saw some rubbish in the Daily Mail

16
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,344
让我颇为愤慨的报道
which made my blood boil:

17
00:01:53,688 --> 00:01:55,346
Traitor's  Nest要被铲平了
Traitor's nest to be pulled down.

18
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:57,974
180几尼
One hundred and eighty guineas?

19
00:01:58,234 --> 00:02:00,309
180几尼  还有其他出价吗
One hundred and eighty? Have we done?

20
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:05,273
女士们  先生们  接下来是拍卖会的压轴
Ladies and gentlemen, a great highlight of the sale:

21
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,900
414号拍卖品
Lot 414

22
00:02:08,203 --> 00:02:11,115
一幅伊丽莎白时代的肖像画
the fine Elizabethan portrait

23
00:02:11,116 --> 00:02:12,572
一个高贵的绅士
A Portly Gentleman.

24
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:15,032
起价是2000几尼
I'll start the bidding at 2000 guineas.

25
00:02:15,752 --> 00:02:17,285
2000几尼  谢谢出价
2000 guineas, thank you.

26
00:02:17,285 --> 00:02:18,285
2200

27
00:02:18,285 --> 00:02:19,285
2400

28
00:02:19,285 --> 00:02:20,285
2600

29
00:02:20,285 --> 00:02:21,285
2800

30
00:02:23,593 --> 00:02:25,334
3000  3200
3000. 3200.

31
00:02:25,386 --> 00:02:27,420
3400  3600
3400. 3600.

32
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,420
3800

33
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:32,185
4000  4500
4000 guineas. Four and a half thousand.

34
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:35,313
5000

35
00:02:35,313 --> 00:02:36,313
5500
And a half.

36
00:02:36,313 --> 00:02:37,313
6000

37
00:02:37,313 --> 00:02:38,313
6500
And a half.

38
00:02:38,313 --> 00:02:39,313
7000

39
00:02:39,313 --> 00:02:40,313
7500
And a half.

40
00:02:40,313 --> 00:02:41,313
8000

41
00:02:41,313 --> 00:02:42,313
8500
And a half.

42
00:02:42,313 --> 00:02:43,313
9000

43
00:02:43,313 --> 00:02:44,313
9500
And a half.

44
00:02:44,313 --> 00:02:45,313
10000
10000 guineas is bid.

45
00:02:45,313 --> 00:02:46,313
10500
And a half.

46
00:02:46,313 --> 00:02:47,313
11000

47
00:02:47,313 --> 00:02:48,313
11500
And a half.

48
00:02:56,251 --> 00:03:00,328
意下如何  先生  已经11500几尼了
Against you, sir, at eleven and a half thousand guineas.

49
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:06,083
11500几尼  成交
All done at eleven and a half thousand guineas.

50
00:03:06,428 --> 00:03:10,171
我十分欣慰地得知
I was very relieved to read how an American millionaire

51
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:12,298
一位叫刘易斯的美国富翁  拯救了达林顿府
named Lewis saved Darlington Hall

52
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:15,468
你就不用从那里搬走了
so you wouldn't be turned out of your home after all.

53
00:03:15,812 --> 00:03:18,012
他是不是就是那个
Is it the same Congressman Lewis

54
00:03:18,273 --> 00:03:22,183
1963年获得爵位的那个国会议员刘易斯
who attended His Lordship's conference in 1936?

55
00:03:32,328 --> 00:03:35,196
史蒂文斯先生  我经常回忆起那些往日的美好时光
Mr. Stevens, I so often think of the good old days

56
00:03:35,373 --> 00:03:38,074
那时我还是达林顿府的管家
when I was the housekeeper.

57
00:03:38,334 --> 00:03:39,710
工作很辛苦
It was hard work.

58
00:03:39,711 --> 00:03:44,038
我也知道  史蒂文斯先生您是一个不苟言笑的人
I know

59
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:48,334
但我依旧认为那些年是我一生中最快乐的时光
but those years with you were among the happiest of my life.

60
00:03:52,807 --> 00:03:55,341
现在你肯定有一帮新的手下
You must have a completely different staff now.

61
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:57,927
那些老面孔应该都不在了
Not many of the old faces around anymore.

62
00:03:58,146 --> 00:04:04,642
我一直觉得达林顿公爵雇的男仆太多  没有太大必要
There's not much need for the small army of footmen

63
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,910
我最近也不是很顺
My own news is not very cheerful.

64
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:25,444
距离我上次给你写信的7年间
In the 7 years since I last wrote,

65
00:04:25,445 --> 00:04:27,112
我又一次离开了我的丈夫
I have again left my husband

66
00:04:27,342 --> 00:04:30,751
遗憾地告诉您  我的婚姻看起来是完了
and, sad to say, my marriage seems to be over.

67
00:04:31,054 --> 00:04:33,880
我现在寄宿在克利夫顿的小旅馆那里
I'm staying at a friend's boarding house in Clevedon.

68
00:05:03,628 --> 00:05:05,912
我不知道未来会怎样
I don't know what my future is.

69
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:09,329
自从我女儿  凯瑟琳去年结婚之后
Since Catherine, my daughter, got married,

70
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,083
我的生活就变得很空洞
my life has been empty.

71
00:05:11,136 --> 00:05:15,296
我眼前一片茫然  不知如何来填补我的生活
The years stretch before me and if only I knew how to fill them.

72
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,414
但我很想能再度工作
But I would like to be useful again.

73
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:29,101
-又烤焦了  -不好意思  先生
-Burned again? -Yes, I'm sorry, sir.

74
00:05:29,904 --> 00:05:32,574
厨房里一直以来总是
The rule in the kitchen has always been

75
00:05:32,907 --> 00:05:37,735
厨师专注于煮早餐  放任她的助手烤面包
cook cooks the cooked breakfast while her assistant toasts the toast.

76
00:05:37,996 --> 00:05:40,394
为什么不给她添置一个面包机呢
Why don't we get her a pop-up toaster?

77
00:05:40,749 --> 00:05:42,766
我们不需要这种小东西
We need not a new gadget

78
00:05:42,767 --> 00:05:44,784
而是需要一套新的人事方案
but a revised staff plan, sir.

79
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:48,454
人事方案  我们有吗
A staff plan, huh? I didn't know we had one.

80
00:05:48,673 --> 00:05:51,541
一套不怎么好的人事方案
A faulty one, unfortunately.

81
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:53,876
先生  最近
Sir, quite recently

82
00:05:54,929 --> 00:06:01,425
您曾建议我应该休息一下  到处走走
you were kind enough to suggest that I go on a little holiday trip

83
00:06:01,853 --> 00:06:04,418
对极了  好好放松一下
Absolutely. Certainly, take a break. See the world.

84
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:05,721
谢谢先生
Thank you, sir.

85
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:09,214
你上一次出门走访世界是什么时候
When did you last see the world?

86
00:06:11,613 --> 00:06:12,999
请允许我这样讲
The world always used to come to this house,

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,773
在过去  整个世界都会聚集到这房子来
if I may say so.

88
00:06:16,034 --> 00:06:17,400
确实可以这么说
You may say so.

89
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:21,310
那么下周我去伦敦时  你就放个假吧
Take off when I'm in London next week.

90
00:06:22,332 --> 00:06:24,157
车子也借给你用
I tell you what, you take the car.

91
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:27,243
-那辆老戴姆勒  -先生  我不能接受
-Take the Daimler. -Good Lord, sir, I couldn't.

92
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,789
你跟那辆车是天生一对  史蒂文斯
You and that Daimler belong together.

93
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:35,501
您真是太好了  先生
That's most kind of you, I must say, sir. Most kind.

94
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:40,882
我想到西部去走走  听说那里有不错的风景
I'd meant to travel the West, where I understand we have splendid scenery.

95
00:06:41,226 --> 00:06:45,803
也许我还能顺便去雇个人把眼前的人事问题解决掉
And I might incidentally be able to solve our problems while I'm there.

96
00:06:46,022 --> 00:06:50,975
前任的女管家  现在暂时住在克利夫顿
A former housekeeper, at present living in Clevedon, has indicated

97
00:06:51,236 --> 00:06:53,853
她有意愿回来继续工作
that she might be prepared to return to service.

98
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:55,938
是你的女朋友
What's this, your girlfriend?

99
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:57,513
还是余情未了
Or a former attachment?

100
00:06:58,284 --> 00:06:59,650
不  先生
Oh, no, sir.

101
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,529
她是一个非常能干的女管家
No, but a very able housekeeper.

102
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,823
非常能干
A most able housekeeper.

103
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:08,951
我开玩笑的  史蒂文斯
I was just kidding, Stevens.

104
00:07:09,045 --> 00:07:09,994
我很抱歉
Sorry.

105
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,208
知道我最喜欢英国报纸什么地方吗
You know what I like best about your papers?

106
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,126
这些讣告
These obituaries.

107
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:20,463
无论什么样的混蛋都能得到很体面的葬礼讣文
Every son of a gun gets this stately funeral oration.

108
00:07:20,723 --> 00:07:23,883
-美国可没有这东西  -确实  先生
-It's not an art we have in the States. -Indeed, sir.

109
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,969
谢谢  史蒂文斯
Thank you, Stevens.

110
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:28,763
刘易斯先生
Mr. Lewis.

111
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,090
亲爱的贝恩太太
Dear Mrs. Benn

112
00:08:04,476 --> 00:08:08,845
我计划于10月3日下午4点左右到达克利夫顿
I propose to reach Clevedon on October 3rd around 4 p. m.

113
00:08:09,147 --> 00:08:14,176
如果您能写封信到亨格福德邮局与我联系
I'd be grateful for a line from you

114
00:08:14,177 --> 00:08:15,685
我将不胜感激
to

115
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:18,855
我准备在那里稍作停留
where I'm planning to stop.

116
00:08:25,163 --> 00:08:29,407
贝恩夫人  你一直有非常好的记忆力
Mrs. Benn, I always said you possess an amazing memory.

117
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:32,660
府邸的新主人确实是国会议员刘易斯
Our new employer is indeed Congressman Lewis

118
00:08:32,921 --> 00:08:35,997
现在他已经从政治舞台退休了
though he's now retired from political life in the U.S.

119
00:08:36,633 --> 00:08:41,294
他现正住在达林顿府  不久他的家人也会搬来
He's taken up residence at Darlington Hall, soon to be joined by his family.

120
00:08:41,638 --> 00:08:44,800
我不得不说  对于这样一个大家庭
But I regret to say we are woefully understaffed

121
00:08:44,801 --> 00:08:46,382
我们实在是人手不足
for a house this size.

122
00:08:46,851 --> 00:08:50,928
贝恩夫人  下面这些话绝不是恭维
Mrs. Benn, will you permit me once again to sing your praises?

123
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:53,764
自从你因结婚而离开这里
Let me state that when you left to get married

124
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:59,187
没有任何一个女管家能做到你那样井井有条
no housekeeper ever reached your high standard in any department.

125
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,533
我还清晰记得你刚来达林顿府的时候
I well remember your arrival at Darlington Hall.

126
00:09:12,794 --> 00:09:15,233
你就这么出乎意料地来了
You came somewhat unexpectedly,

127
00:09:15,234 --> 00:09:16,735
甚至可以说很贸然
one might even say impulsively

128
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,333
那天我们都在忙于查格洛夫镇的聚会
while we were dead in the middle of the Charlgrove meet.

129
00:09:20,385 --> 00:09:23,503
那天还有一件事让我记忆犹新
That day is marked in my memory in another way as well.

130
00:09:23,805 --> 00:09:25,630
那是最后一次公爵像以前一样
It was the last time His Lordship

131
00:09:25,974 --> 00:09:29,217
热忱欢迎他的邻居们
was happy to welcome his neighbours, as in the old days.

132
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,299
当然是由于已经好多年
Of course, it had been years

133
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,377
他们没有来硬拉他去打猎的关系
since any of them had coaxed him to hunt.

134
00:09:33,648 --> 00:09:37,141
这是公爵从来都不喜欢的运动
It was never a sport His Lordship enjoyed or approved of.

135
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,626
早上好  埃尔
Good morning, Ayres.

136
00:10:00,627 --> 00:10:02,041
公爵  很高兴见到您
My lord, nice to see you.

137
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:09,757
请用  先生
Excuse me, sir.

138
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:36,450
可能刚开始我对你有点冷淡  甚至不近人情
I fear I may have been a little unwelcoming, even a little short.

139
00:10:36,544 --> 00:10:39,579
你的简历是我所见过的最优秀的
You presented the best references I've ever seen.

140
00:10:39,756 --> 00:10:41,998
那也是当然的
Which proved to be well-deserved.

141
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:46,116
同时  我承认  你的年轻也让我有所顾虑
Though, I confess, I did have my doubts, on account of your youth.

142
00:10:46,638 --> 00:10:48,963
绝不允许男性拜访者
No gentleman callers allowed, of course.

143
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:52,925
原谅我提到这一点  但我们以前在这方面出过事
Forgive my mentioning it, but we've had those problems before.

144
00:10:53,144 --> 00:10:54,886
也是发生在宅子里
Inside the house too.

145
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:59,046
之前的女管家跟男管家助理私奔了
The previous housekeeper ran off with the under-butler.

146
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:03,069
当然  如果两个员工相爱并决定结婚
If two staff members decide to get married,

147
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,228
那也无可非议
one can say nothing.

148
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:06,689
但最让我恼火的情况是
What I find a major irritation

149
00:11:06,741 --> 00:11:11,892
那些到处闲逛去追寻浪漫的员工
are those persons who go from post to post looking for romance.

150
00:11:12,956 --> 00:11:15,781
女管家们在这方面特别容易陷进去
Housekeepers are particularly guilty here.

151
00:11:16,084 --> 00:11:18,482
-当然不是特意针对你  -没关系
-No offense intended, of course. -None taken.

152
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:22,216
我知道仆人们开始互相恋爱
I know how a house is at sixes and sevens

153
00:11:22,217 --> 00:11:24,363
会让家里变得乱七八糟
once the staff start marrying.

154
00:11:24,592 --> 00:11:25,833
是的
Yes, indeed.

155
00:11:30,932 --> 00:11:33,216
-能跟您说句话吗  先生  -当然
-Might I have a word, sir? -Of course.

156
00:11:38,982 --> 00:11:41,651
老爷  关于上个月
My lord, it's regarding the under-butler

157
00:11:41,943 --> 00:11:44,185
私奔的男副管家和女管家
and the housekeeper who ran off last month.

158
00:11:45,613 --> 00:11:47,605
麻烦事  你处理的怎么样了
Bad business. How are you managing?

159
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:50,483
我找到了两个优秀的替代者
I've found two first-rate replacements.

160
00:11:50,535 --> 00:11:53,528
肯顿小姐  有极优秀的工作经历
Miss Kenton, a young woman with excellent references.

161
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:56,531
举止得体  显得十分有管理能力
Very pleasing demeanour. Appears to be very able.

162
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,908
还有一个经验丰富的男管家
And a man with considerable experience.

163
00:11:59,669 --> 00:12:04,080
-年纪大点  但乐意做男副管家  -姓什么
-Older and happy to be under-butler. -Name?

164
00:12:04,382 --> 00:12:05,164
史蒂文斯
Stevens, sir.

165
00:12:05,508 --> 00:12:07,250
-史蒂文斯   -是的  老爷
-Stevens? -Yes, sir.

166
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:10,211
-这不是你的姓吗   -他是我父亲
-That's your name. -He's my father, sir.

167
00:12:10,847 --> 00:12:12,119
这样啊
Really?

168
00:12:12,807 --> 00:12:15,508
再好不过了  很期待什么时候能见见他
Couldn't do better. I'd like to see him sometime.

169
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,749
他就在门外
He's outside the door.

170
00:12:17,228 --> 00:12:18,761
好  带他进来
Good. Bring him in.

171
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,555
谢谢  老爷
Thank you, my lord.

172
00:12:25,695 --> 00:12:26,602
父亲
Father.

173
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:33,526
史蒂文斯先生  你好
Mr. Stevens, how do you do?

174
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:36,352
-老爷  -你儿子是个得力管家
-My lord. -Very good man here, your son.

175
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:40,522
他把房子管理的很好  没了他可不行
He serves the house well. I don't know what we'd do without him.

176
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:43,077
-你为他骄傲吧  -非常  老爷
-Proud of him? -Very, my lord.

177
00:12:43,546 --> 00:12:44,735
很对
Quite right too.

178
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:47,915
很高兴你能来到这里
Glad to have you with us.

179
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:49,417
谢谢  老爷
Thank you, my lord.

180
00:12:53,056 --> 00:12:56,007
今天正餐是什么时候  下午2点  4点
What are we at dinner tonight? 14:00? 16:00?

181
00:12:56,184 --> 00:12:57,206
中午12点  老爷
Twelve, sir.

182
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:58,259
很好
Right.

183
00:12:59,896 --> 00:13:01,001
谢谢  老爷
Thank you, my lord.

184
00:13:29,551 --> 00:13:32,222
这只水壶我不知道该放哪儿
This pitcher seems out of place here.

185
00:13:32,223 --> 00:13:34,003
饭厅  当心别碰坏
Dining room. Well spotted.

186
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:46,516
-你好  威廉  -日安  肯顿小姐
-Hello, William, how are you? -Good day, Miss Kenton.

187
00:14:29,486 --> 00:14:33,229
我想这些能为你的会客厅增添一份光彩
I thought these might brighten your parlour.

188
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:34,762
您说什么
Beg your pardon?

189
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:38,276
它们能给你带来好心情
They might cheer things up for you.

190
00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:40,236
您真好心
That's very kind of you.

191
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,710
如果您愿意  我可以多采一些来
If you like, I could bring in some more for you.

192
00:14:46,002 --> 00:14:47,410
谢谢
Thank you

193
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:51,664
但是我把这间屋子当作私人工作室
but I regard this room as my private place of work

194
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:54,834
希望尽量少摆设一些让我分心的东西
and I prefer to keep distractions to a minimum.

195
00:14:55,053 --> 00:14:57,920
您怎么会认为这些花会让您分心呢
Would you call flowers a distraction, then?

196
00:14:58,181 --> 00:15:01,507
我感谢您的好意  屋子还是保持原样为好
I appreciate your kindness. I prefer to keep things as they are.

197
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:06,429
既然你在这儿了  有件事我想对您说
But since you are here, there is a small matter I wanted to mention.

198
00:15:06,523 --> 00:15:10,183
昨天早上我正巧从厨房经过
I happened to be walking past the kitchen yesterday morning

199
00:15:10,485 --> 00:15:13,050
听到你叫某人"威廉"
and I heard you call to someone named William.

200
00:15:13,321 --> 00:15:16,689
请问您是在称呼哪位
May I ask who you were addressing by that name?

201
00:15:17,992 --> 00:15:20,818
我应该是在称呼您父亲
I should think I was addressing your father.

202
00:15:21,704 --> 00:15:24,030
这里没有其他人叫威廉
There are no other Williams in this house.

203
00:15:24,249 --> 00:15:25,198
是这样
True.

204
00:15:26,334 --> 00:15:29,952
请您以后称呼我父亲"史蒂文斯先生"
May I ask you in future to address my father as Mr. Stevens?

205
00:15:30,505 --> 00:15:33,623
如果是在对下属提到他时  你可以称他
If speaking of him to a third party, you may call him

206
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,417
史蒂文斯一世  作为与称呼我的区别
Mr. Stevens Sr. to distinguish him from myself.

207
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:40,411
我会很感激您这么做的  肯顿小姐
So I would be most grateful to you, Miss Kenton.

208
00:15:41,766 --> 00:15:45,176
我不是很理解您的意思
I don't quite understand what you're getting at.

209
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:50,389
我是这里的女管家  您父亲是副男管家
I am the housekeeper in this house, and your father is the under-butler.

210
00:15:50,734 --> 00:15:55,186
我习惯用下属的名字来称呼他们
I am accustomed to addressing under-servants by their Christian names.

211
00:15:56,656 --> 00:16:00,733
请先停下  听我说
If you would stop to think for a moment, you'd realize

212
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,904
像您这样用名字直接称呼我父亲
how inappropriate it is for one such as yourself to address as William

213
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:07,532
是极为不合适的
someone such as my father.

214
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:12,995
想必您父亲一定觉得很难堪
It must have been very galling for your father to be called William

215
00:16:13,256 --> 00:16:15,331
像我这样身份的人直呼其名
by one such as myself.

216
00:16:15,383 --> 00:16:17,750
我想说的是  如果您仔细观察
My father is a person from whom

217
00:16:18,094 --> 00:16:21,254
您将从他身上学到不少东西
if you'd observe him more, you may learn things.

218
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:24,131
我很感激您的建议  但请一定要告诉我
I'm grateful for your advice, but do tell me

219
00:16:24,434 --> 00:16:26,509
我能从他那儿学到什么
what things might I learn from him?

220
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:28,886
请允许我指出一点
I might point out that you're

221
00:16:29,063 --> 00:16:31,848
您还不是很熟悉一些物品的摆放位置和用途
often unsure of what goes where and which item is which.

222
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:37,311
我确信史蒂文斯一世精于他的工作职责
I'm sure Mr. Stevens Sr. is very good at his job

223
00:16:37,781 --> 00:16:41,149
但我也向您保证  我也对于自己的工作十分擅长
but I can assure you that I'm very good at mine.

224
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:42,431
-当然  -谢谢
-Of course. -Thank you.

225
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,569
请允许我先告辞了
If you will please excuse me.

226
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:50,283
好吧
Oh, well.

227
00:16:58,635 --> 00:17:00,710
向我们的厨师致意
My compliments to cook.

228
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:03,129
多么美味的脆皮
What a lovely piece of crackling.

229
00:17:04,682 --> 00:17:09,802
你好像说了些有趣的话  跟大家分享一下吧
I'm sure you said something witty. Share it with the rest of us.

230
00:17:10,355 --> 00:17:13,295
我说这些青豆做的很棒  我很喜欢
I said the sprouts is done the way I like them.

231
00:17:13,296 --> 00:17:14,765
很干脆  没有太硬
Crisp-like, not mushy.

232
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:17,059
应该是很"松脆"  不是很"干脆"
Sprouts "are" done, not " is" done.

233
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:18,853
对吧  乔治
Isn't that right, George?

234
00:17:18,947 --> 00:17:19,969
是的  史蒂文斯先生
Yes, Mr. Stevens.

235
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,150
抱歉纠正你的用词  因为我在你这年纪
Forgive the correction, as I would have done

236
00:17:24,202 --> 00:17:27,028
十分注重养成自己的言语得当
at your age for the sake of my education.

237
00:17:27,288 --> 00:17:31,616
我相信你也和其他人一样有志于升职
I'm sure even you have ambitions to rise in your profession.

238
00:17:31,876 --> 00:17:35,703
是的  我也想成为一个管家  被称呼为某某先生
Oh, yes. I want to be a butler, to be called Mister

239
00:17:36,047 --> 00:17:38,940
坐在自己的小客厅  有自己的壁炉
sit in my own pantry by my own fire,

240
00:17:38,941 --> 00:17:39,905
嘴上叼着雪茄
smoking my cigar.

241
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,711
你知道要成为一个优秀的管家最重要的是什么
I wonder if you realize what it takes to be a great butler?

242
00:17:43,972 --> 00:17:46,297
保持庄重  处乱不惊
Takes dignity, that's what it takes.

243
00:17:46,808 --> 00:17:50,749
谢谢  史蒂文斯先生  重点是要处乱不惊
Thank you, Mr. Stevens. Dignity, that's right. Dignity.

244
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:55,431
绅士中的绅士  这本杂志上给出的定义是这样
The definition from our quarterly The Gentlemen's Gentleman:

245
00:17:55,692 --> 00:17:58,226
优秀的管家必须要做到超乎想象的处乱不惊
A great butler must be possessed of dignity-

246
00:17:58,528 --> 00:18:00,645
才能保住他的职位
In keeping with his position.

247
00:18:02,741 --> 00:18:05,858
曾经在印度有一个英国管家
There was this English butler in India.

248
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:11,322
一天他走到饭厅里  发现有什么东西在桌子下
One day, he goes in the dining room and what's under the table?

249
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,573
一只老虎
A tiger.

250
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:17,328
他面不改色地走到客厅
Not turning a hair, he goes to the drawing room.

251
00:18:19,174 --> 00:18:20,761
打扰您  老爷
Excuse me, my lord.

252
00:18:20,762 --> 00:18:23,584
为了不打扰在场的女士  他轻声说
And whispering, so as not to upset the ladies:

253
00:18:24,512 --> 00:18:27,755
餐厅里有只老虎
" I'm sorry. There appears to be a tiger in the dining room.

254
00:18:28,433 --> 00:18:32,510
请允许我用枪射杀它
Perhaps His Lordship will permit use of the twelve-bores?"

255
00:18:34,063 --> 00:18:38,724
他们继续用着茶  突然  三声枪响
They go on drinking their tea. And then, there's three gunshots.

256
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:41,098
他们谁也没觉得奇怪
They don't think nothing of it.

257
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:43,688
在印度  人们对什么事都习以为常
In India, they're used to anything.

258
00:18:44,449 --> 00:18:47,650
当管家回来帮他们的茶续杯时
When the butler is back to refresh the teapots

259
00:18:48,369 --> 00:18:50,528
他十分镇定地说道
he says, cool as a cucumber:

260
00:18:50,705 --> 00:18:53,990
老爷  午餐将按时开始
" Dinner will be served at the usual time, my lord.

261
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:58,703
我也向您保证  到时餐厅里会跟往常一样
And I am pleased to say there will be no discernible traces left

262
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:02,206
不会留下任何异样的痕迹
of the recent occurrence by that time. "

263
00:19:04,427 --> 00:19:08,171
这句话  "到时餐厅里会跟往常一样"
I'll repeat it. "There will be no discernible traces left

264
00:19:08,431 --> 00:19:12,206
"不会留下任何异样的痕迹"
of the recent occurrence by that time. "

265
00:19:13,645 --> 00:19:15,064
很精彩  史蒂文斯先生
Wonderful, Mr. Stevens.

266
00:19:15,065 --> 00:19:16,179
谢谢  史蒂文斯先生
Thank you, Mr. Stevens.

267
00:19:16,481 --> 00:19:17,852
精彩的故事
Wonderful story.

268
00:19:17,853 --> 00:19:21,184
我们都该努力做到这一点  处乱不惊
That's the ideal that we should all aim for. Dignity.

269
00:19:24,322 --> 00:19:25,396
找您的  史蒂文斯先生
For you, Mr. Stevens.

270
00:19:26,157 --> 00:19:27,148
谢谢
Thank you.

271
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,901
是找史蒂文斯先生一世的  史蒂文斯先生
It's for Mr. Stevens Sr., Mr. Stevens.

272
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,403
谢谢  肯顿小姐
Thank you, Miss Kenton.

273
00:19:34,499 --> 00:19:37,658
玛丽  把他的盘子放到厨师那里去保温
Put Mr. Stevens Sr. 's plate with cook to keep it warm.

274
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,160
是  肯顿小姐
Yes, Miss Kenton.

275
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:41,787
谢谢您  肯顿小姐
Thank you.

276
00:19:42,132 --> 00:19:43,915
不用谢  史蒂文斯先生
Not at all, Mr. Stevens.

277
00:21:16,851 --> 00:21:20,386
史蒂文斯先生  我看到您的扫帚在外面地上
If you're searching for your dustpan, it is out on the landing.

278
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:21,679
我的扫帚
My dustpan?

279
00:21:21,898 --> 00:21:24,265
您把它放地上了
You've left it on the landing.

280
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:26,218
我没用过扫帚
I haven't used a dustpan.

281
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:28,603
是吗  那么也许是别人的
Really? It must be somebody else.

282
00:21:28,905 --> 00:21:30,429
我不明白你的意思
I don't follow you.

283
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,231
是我弄错了  脑子不好使
My mistake, no doubt. One of many.

284
00:21:38,915 --> 00:21:40,072
早上好  先生
Morning, sir.

285
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:55,046
我邀请了杜邦作为会议上法国的代表
I've invited Giscard Dupont D'Ivry as the French delegate.

286
00:21:55,265 --> 00:21:56,839
他才不会来
He'll never come!

287
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,634
他保证说会来的
I just had word of his acceptance.

288
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:04,931
杜邦十分针对德国  他在33年日内瓦的演说
Dupont is fanatically anti-German. His speech in Geneva in 33'

289
00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:07,861
让我都汗颜与法国站在同一战线
made me ashamed to be an ally of the French.

290
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:09,852
这绝不是我们英国人的做派
It's not the English way.

291
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:11,020
当然
No, it is not.

292
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:13,202
我们这次会议的目的
This is the purpose of our conference,

293
00:22:13,203 --> 00:22:15,858
就是要非正式地讨论国际局势
to discuss these matters informally

294
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:19,153
绝不是那种国际化的死气沉沉的会议
far from the to-do of an international conference

295
00:22:19,247 --> 00:22:21,489
而是友好地  放松地
in the friendly and relaxed

296
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,742
聚在某个人的家里
atmosphere of one's home.

297
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:28,830
我们可以说服法国人接受我们的观点
We may bring round the French to our point of view.

298
00:22:29,132 --> 00:22:31,040
对德国人也是一样
And that of the Germans.

299
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:35,837
不过我插一句  我们怎样来联合德国人
I'm sorry to interrupt, but how can we associate with the Germans?

300
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:40,091
那可是纳粹  他们撕毁协议又践踏公约
With the Nazi Party! They have torn up and trampled every treaty

301
00:22:40,268 --> 00:22:42,884
对欧洲来说是日渐增长的威胁
and are a growing threat to Europe,

302
00:22:42,885 --> 00:22:44,804
更别说德国的独裁统治了
not to mention a brutal dictatorship.

303
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:50,257
年轻人  我也曾去过柏林
My dear boy, when I was in Berlin, I saw at last a happy German people

304
00:22:50,695 --> 00:22:54,981
看到的是衣食无忧  热爱自己国家和元首的普通人
with jobs, bread, pride in their country and love of their leader.

305
00:22:55,283 --> 00:22:57,150
那么犹太人呢
And what about the Jews?

306
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:07,524
史蒂文斯先生  老爷说要把陈列室里的中国人像
Did His Lordship wish to exchange the Chinaman in the cabinet room

307
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:09,579
放到大厅里来吗
with the one outside the door?

308
00:23:10,131 --> 00:23:11,497
-中国人像   -是的
-Chinaman? -Yes.

309
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,066
原本在陈列室的中国人像就在门外大厅里
The Chinaman from the cabinet room is outside this door.

310
00:23:15,067 --> 00:23:16,210
您自己去看一下
See for yourself.

311
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:18,462
我现在很忙
I'm busy at the moment.

312
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:22,758
就把头伸出去您亲自看一下
Just pop your head outside this door and see for yourself.

313
00:23:22,852 --> 00:23:27,013
-我等会再去看  -您以为我在胡诌
-I'll look into the matter later. -You think it's a fantasy?

314
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:30,099
因为我缺乏经验所以就胡诌了吗
A fantasy on my part due to my inexperience?

315
00:23:30,235 --> 00:23:33,811
我在这里的事还没忙完  肯顿小姐
I'm busy in this room, Miss Kenton.

316
00:23:34,072 --> 00:23:35,344
那我等着
I shall wait.

317
00:23:36,408 --> 00:23:37,429
就在门外
Outside.

318
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:41,128
看
Look!

319
00:24:41,473 --> 00:24:44,257
-那不是原来在那儿的人像  -我很忙
-Is that not the wrong Chinaman? -I am very busy.

320
00:24:44,601 --> 00:24:46,968
您难道没有别的事可做了吗
Have you nothing better to do than stand around?

321
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,387
您看一下  跟我说实话
Look at it and tell me the truth.

322
00:24:49,481 --> 00:24:50,614
把声音放轻点
Keep your voice down.

323
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:52,598
其他佣人看到我们因为一个人像
What would the other servants think

324
00:24:52,942 --> 00:24:55,184
而大肆争吵  会怎么想
of us shouting about a Chinaman?

325
00:24:55,528 --> 00:24:57,228
那么我就请您
And I would ask you

326
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:01,149
转过身  看一看那个人像
to turn around and look at the Chinaman.

327
00:25:07,082 --> 00:25:08,614
只是犯了个小错而已
It is a small mistake.

328
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:12,326
您父亲的工作量超过了他的年纪所能承受的
Your father is entrusted with more than he can cope with.

329
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:13,744
让我过去
Let me pass.

330
00:25:14,047 --> 00:25:16,831
是您父亲把扫帚放在了楼梯上
Your father left the dustpan on the floor.

331
00:25:17,175 --> 00:25:19,959
他忘记了磨刀具  又把人像搞错了
He left polish on the cutlery and confused the Chinaman.

332
00:25:20,303 --> 00:25:22,753
在他犯下大错之前  你要认清现状
Recognize this before he commits a major error!

333
00:25:22,931 --> 00:25:25,270
您不能用这种语气跟我说话
You can't talk to me like this.

334
00:25:25,271 --> 00:25:26,674
恐怕我不得不这样
I'm afraid I must.

335
00:25:26,935 --> 00:25:29,218
我是在给您提建议
I'm giving you serious advice.

336
00:25:29,771 --> 00:25:33,890
为了他的健康  必须得给他减轻一些工作量
Your father should be relieved of a number of his duties for his own good.

337
00:25:35,068 --> 00:25:36,916
不论他曾经多么能干
Whatever he once was,

338
00:25:36,917 --> 00:25:39,437
他现在已经没有那份精力和体力了
he no longer has the same ability or strength.

339
00:25:40,365 --> 00:25:42,648
我感谢您的建议
I thank you for your advice.

340
00:25:42,992 --> 00:25:44,942
现在我要继续做我的事了
Perhaps now I can go about my business.

341
00:25:45,245 --> 00:25:47,778
我从没想过要打扰您做事
I never meant to keep you from your business.

342
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,780
谢谢
Thank you.

343
00:25:53,586 --> 00:25:58,331
我们要尽快达成一项公约  赶在
It's vital that we've agreed a common policy before the arrival of

344
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:01,821
在那个法国人来之前  他叫什么来着
your Frenchman. What's his name?

345
00:26:01,822 --> 00:26:02,919
吉斯卡德  杜邦
Giscard Dupont D'Ivry.

346
00:26:03,304 --> 00:26:05,505
同时我们也将迎来美国代表
We also expect the American delegate

347
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:08,674
国会议刘易斯  也会在同一天到达
Congressman Lewis, to arrive on the same day.

348
00:26:09,227 --> 00:26:10,760
这个美国人是谁
Who is he, this American?

349
00:26:11,563 --> 00:26:13,542
他是一个未知数
He's an unknown quantity.

350
00:26:13,543 --> 00:26:16,182
一个年轻的宾夕法尼亚议员
A young congressman from Pennsylvania.

351
00:26:16,443 --> 00:26:19,936
在一些国际会议上也有崭露头角
Sits on some sort of powerful Foreign Affairs Committee.

352
00:26:20,155 --> 00:26:22,522
大概是某个有钱的美国佬的后裔
Heir to one of those American fortunes.

353
00:26:22,866 --> 00:26:24,857
-原来是卖肉的   -卖手推车的
-Meatpacking? -Trolley cars?

354
00:26:25,201 --> 00:26:26,734
还是卖干货的
Or dry goods?

355
00:26:27,162 --> 00:26:28,986
干货是什么东西
What are dry goods?

356
00:26:29,372 --> 00:26:31,854
反正是美国人以此赚了大钱的东西
Something that Americans make a lot of money in.

357
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:36,702
我认为刘易斯先生的财富是来源于化妆品
No, I think Mr. Lewis' fortune comes from cosmetics, actually.

358
00:26:42,177 --> 00:26:43,584
是老史蒂文斯
It's old Mr. Stevens!

359
00:26:45,138 --> 00:26:47,296
拿个靠垫来  还有毯子
Get a cushion, quickly. A blanket!

360
00:26:51,019 --> 00:26:53,261
银器！(摔坏了)
The silver! The silver!

361
00:26:54,522 --> 00:26:56,597
老爷  对不起
Oh, my lord. Sorry.

362
00:26:57,317 --> 00:26:58,683
你会没事的
You'll be all right.

363
00:26:59,611 --> 00:27:02,520
谢谢老爷  对不起  出了什么事
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry. What happened?

364
00:27:02,822 --> 00:27:05,648
-他端着盘子  被绊倒了  -我从窗内看到了
-He tripped with the tray. -I saw it from the window.

365
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,984
这以前从没发生过  老爷
This has never happened before.

366
00:27:08,078 --> 00:27:11,070
-我可以打电话叫医生来吗   -当然
-May I telephone the doctor? -Yes, do.

367
00:27:12,749 --> 00:27:14,574
-对不起  -别担心
-I'm sorry. -Don't worry.

368
00:27:27,889 --> 00:27:29,964
你父亲好些了吗
Your father feeling better?

369
00:27:30,141 --> 00:27:32,049
他完全恢复了  老爷
He's made a full recovery.

370
00:27:32,102 --> 00:27:33,676
很好
Good.

371
00:27:33,937 --> 00:27:37,972
我们都不希望那样的事再发生  对吧
We don't wish to see anything of that sort ever happen again, do we?

372
00:27:38,274 --> 00:27:40,060
我是指你父亲摔倒这事
I mean, your father collapsing.

373
00:27:40,061 --> 00:27:41,434
确实是这样  老爷
Indeed not, my lord.

374
00:27:41,611 --> 00:27:43,811
而且无论何时  无论何地
And it could happen anywhere.

375
00:27:44,572 --> 00:27:46,022
都可能发生
At any time.

376
00:27:47,242 --> 00:27:51,277
听着  第一位外国代表将在两周内到达
The first of the foreign delegates will be here in less than a fortnight.

377
00:27:51,579 --> 00:27:53,590
我们都做了充分的准备  老爷
We are well prepared, my lord.

378
00:27:53,591 --> 00:27:54,655
我毫不怀疑这一点
I'm sure you are.

379
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:57,783
在这里发生的事情将
What happens within this house could have

380
00:27:58,086 --> 00:28:01,245
对整个欧洲的命运产生影响
considerable repercussions on the course that Europe takes.

381
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,623
这件事意义重大
It means a great deal.

382
00:28:03,883 --> 00:28:07,084
对于我个人来讲也是十分重要
And it means a great deal to me personally.

383
00:28:07,512 --> 00:28:11,756
我有个德国朋友  卡尔?汉斯
I had a German friend, Karl-Heinz Bremann.

384
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,800
我们在战时属于敌对的两边
We fought on opposite sides in the war.

385
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:17,233
但是我们约定  等战争结束
We always said when it was over,

386
00:28:17,234 --> 00:28:18,971
可以一起坐下来好好喝一杯
we'd sit down and have a drink

387
00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:20,515
像普通人一样
like gentlemen.

388
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,029
但是凡尔赛条约却让我无颜以对
The Versailles Treaty made a liar of me.

389
00:28:25,822 --> 00:28:28,356
无颜以对  史蒂文斯
Yes, a liar, Stevens.

390
00:28:28,658 --> 00:28:31,173
因为盟军制订的那些制裁条款太过猛烈
Because the terms we imposed were so harsh

391
00:28:31,174 --> 00:28:33,027
以至于整个国家的经济行将崩塌
that Germany was finished.

392
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:35,738
对于战败国来说  不应该是这样的
One doesn't do that to a defeated foe.

393
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:39,367
一旦举白旗投降  就应该全部都结束
Once your man's on the canvas, it ought to be over.

394
00:28:40,253 --> 00:28:43,996
我那个德国朋友  被通货膨胀给害惨了
My friend Bremann was ruined by inflation.

395
00:28:44,674 --> 00:28:47,542
在战后的德国连一份工作都找不到
Couldn't get a job in postwar Germany.

396
00:28:48,511 --> 00:28:49,783
于是自杀了
Killed himself.

397
00:28:51,264 --> 00:28:54,841
在一节火车车厢里开枪自杀了
Shot himself in a railway carriage.

398
00:28:55,810 --> 00:29:00,221
从那时候起  我便觉得有义务帮助德国并
Since then, I've felt it my duty to help Germany and to give her

399
00:29:00,565 --> 00:29:01,806
给这个国家公平的对待
a fair chance.

400
00:29:02,067 --> 00:29:04,100
所以这场会议非常的关键
So this conference is crucial

401
00:29:04,402 --> 00:29:07,979
不能有任何的意外来打乱会议的秩序
and we can't run the risk of any accidents.

402
00:29:08,156 --> 00:29:10,314
你父亲可以不用离开
There's no question of your father leaving.

403
00:29:11,201 --> 00:29:13,526
你只要重新安排一下他的工作就行
You're simply being asked to reconsider his duties.

404
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:16,612
当然  老爷  我完全明白
Of course, my lord. I understand fully.

405
00:29:16,998 --> 00:29:17,989
很好
Good.

406
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:21,742
那这事就交给你了  史蒂文斯
I'll leave you to think about it, then, Stevens.

407
00:29:22,045 --> 00:29:23,067
谢谢  老爷
Thank you, sir.

408
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:32,897
餐厅里缺人手  需要你到备餐室帮忙
I'm short-handed in the dining room. I can use you in the servery.

409
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:36,609
-谢谢  史蒂文斯先生  -表现机灵点
-Thank you, Mr. Stevens, sir. -Smarten up. Look sharp.

410
00:30:44,961 --> 00:30:45,952
早上好
Good morning.

411
00:30:46,337 --> 00:30:47,443
早上好
Good morning.

412
00:30:51,801 --> 00:30:54,877
我猜你肯定早起准备工作了
I might've known you'd be up and ready for the day.

413
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,380
我已经起床两个小时了
I've been up for two hours.

414
00:30:58,016 --> 00:30:59,679
那样睡眠会不足
That's not much sleep.

415
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,676
对于我  这些时间够了
It's all the sleep I need.

416
00:31:04,022 --> 00:31:06,347
我来跟你谈一谈
I've come to talk to you.

417
00:31:06,649 --> 00:31:09,851
说吧  我有一上午的时间
Talk, then. I haven't got all morning.

418
00:31:09,986 --> 00:31:13,396
-那我直说了  -那你就快说吧
-I'll come straight to the point. -Do, and be done with it.

419
00:31:13,656 --> 00:31:16,221
你还有好些事要做
Some of us have work to be getting on with.

420
00:31:18,411 --> 00:31:23,322
下周这里要举办一个很重要的国际会议
There's to be a very important conference in this house next week.

421
00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:27,076
各国的政要都会来这里作客
People of great stature will be His Lordship's guests.

422
00:31:27,587 --> 00:31:29,787
我们必须要做到万无一失
We must all put our best foot forward.

423
00:31:31,508 --> 00:31:34,292
鉴于父亲您最近的意外
Because of Father's recent accident

424
00:31:34,636 --> 00:31:38,327
建议您不用再端盘子服侍用餐了
it has been suggested that you no longer wait at table.

425
00:31:42,811 --> 00:31:46,179
我每天当男仆服侍用餐
I've waited at table every day

426
00:31:46,481 --> 00:31:49,046
已经做了54年了
for the last 54 years.

427
00:31:51,236 --> 00:31:54,896
您以后也不用再端那些重的盘子了
It has also been decided that you should no longer carry heavy trays.

428
00:31:55,907 --> 00:31:59,025
这是一张修改过的工作清单
Now, here's a revised list of your duties.

429
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:00,985
听着  我跌倒
Look, I fell

430
00:32:01,371 --> 00:32:03,154
是因为地上的石块不平整
because of those paving stones.

431
00:32:03,415 --> 00:32:04,489
有凸起的石块
They're crooked.

432
00:32:05,917 --> 00:32:09,410
你为何不在下一个人因此摔倒前去修整一下地面
Why don't you get them put right before someone else falls?

433
00:32:11,506 --> 00:32:15,197
您看一下修改过的工作内容
You will read the revised list of your duties.

434
00:32:15,552 --> 00:32:17,752
去把那些石块给整平了
Get those stones put right.

435
00:32:19,889 --> 00:32:23,883
你不想让那些重要人物因此摔断脖子吧
You don't want those "gentlemen of stature" breaking their necks.

436
00:32:26,271 --> 00:32:28,179
当然不
No, indeed, I don't.

437
00:32:48,001 --> 00:32:49,023
怎么了
What is it?

438
00:33:13,568 --> 00:33:16,561
接下来您的工作需要到处走
You have what we can call a roving commission.

439
00:33:16,863 --> 00:33:20,314
换种说法  就是最大限度地
In other words, you can exercise your own judgment

440
00:33:20,617 --> 00:33:22,733
自由工作
within certain limits, of course.

441
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:26,654
这是你的拖把
Now, here are the mops, and  Here.

442
00:33:26,915 --> 00:33:29,699
-这是我的拖把  -对  这是你的刷子
-Are these me mops? -Right. Your brushes.

443
00:33:29,876 --> 00:33:31,450
这是我的刷子
And me brushes?

444
00:33:32,837 --> 00:33:35,121
-这是我的拖把  -对
-And me mops. -That's right.

445
00:33:38,051 --> 00:33:40,126
你想让我用它们做什么
What do you want me to do with them?

446
00:33:40,595 --> 00:33:43,835
我想你知道要怎么做  父亲
I think you know what to do with them, Father.

447
00:33:43,836 --> 00:33:45,131
擦灰尘和污垢
Look for dust and dirt.

448
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:48,478
如果我发现任何的灰尘和污垢
If I find any dust or dirt

449
00:33:48,686 --> 00:33:51,137
我就用拖把解决掉
I go over them with this mop.

450
00:33:51,481 --> 00:33:52,638
对极了
That's right.

451
00:33:52,857 --> 00:33:55,766
我建议您先从
Now, I suggest you start off

452
00:33:55,944 --> 00:33:58,186
这些门把手开始
with the brasses on the doors.

453
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:01,230
先那边的一扇门  然后是那边开着的那扇
There's that door there. Then the door that's open.

454
00:34:01,533 --> 00:34:03,649
然后那边的门
And then there's this door here

455
00:34:12,127 --> 00:34:14,494
这是你的抛光剂和除尘掸
Here's your polish. And duster.

456
00:34:15,547 --> 00:34:20,458
接下来的一些日子  这里将会创造一段历史
History could well be made under this roof over the next few days.

457
00:34:20,718 --> 00:34:22,585
你们中的每一个人
Each and every one of you

458
00:34:22,887 --> 00:34:27,006
都该为自己在这段时间中的付出感到自豪
can be proud of the role you will play on this occasion.

459
00:34:28,268 --> 00:34:31,219
想象自己身在军队的最前沿
Imagine yourself the head of a battalion

460
00:34:31,438 --> 00:34:34,347
即使你只是在往水壶倒热水
even if it is only filling the hot-water bottles.

461
00:34:35,567 --> 00:34:38,351
每个人的工作都有价值
Each one has his own particular duty

462
00:34:38,528 --> 00:34:41,604
你们各有所长的价值
or her particular duty, as the cap fits.

463
00:34:41,698 --> 00:34:43,786
给铜器抛光  把银器擦亮
Polished brass, brilliant silver,

464
00:34:43,787 --> 00:34:46,025
把红木擦得像镜子一般能映出形状
mahogany shining like a mirror.

465
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:49,987
这是对这些外国来客最好的欢迎
That is the welcome we will show these foreign visitors

466
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:52,448
让他们知道  这是在英国
to let them know they are in England

467
00:34:52,792 --> 00:34:56,452
在这里秩序和传统仍然是不变的主流
where order and tradition still prevail.

468
00:35:26,284 --> 00:35:27,525
谢谢  布莱恩
Thank you, Brian.

469
00:35:57,816 --> 00:36:00,183
老爷  那个美国人刘易斯先生到了
Mr. Lewis, the American, has arrived.

470
00:36:00,527 --> 00:36:03,436
他本该明天才到  你怎么安排他的
He was expected tomorrow. What have you done with him?

471
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,512
已经把刘易斯先生带到楼上房间了
Mr. Lewis has been shown upstairs.

472
00:36:09,702 --> 00:36:13,394
我的教子  卡迪纳尔  最近告诉我要结婚了
My godson, Cardinal, will shortly become engaged to be married.

473
00:36:13,498 --> 00:36:16,324
真好  老爷  恭喜您
Indeed, sir. I offer my congratulations.

474
00:36:16,543 --> 00:36:17,992
谢谢  史蒂文斯
Thank you, Stevens.

475
00:36:19,712 --> 00:36:21,746
我自认对这个孩子责任很重
I feel very responsible for the boy.

476
00:36:21,965 --> 00:36:26,417
你知道他父亲是我最好的朋友  让我当这孩子的教父
He is my godson, and his father was my closest friend, as you know.

477
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:29,045
现在他去世了
And now that he's gone, well

478
00:36:29,472 --> 00:36:32,173
我感觉自己就像是他父亲一样
I feel in place of a father to him.

479
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,384
我任命他在会议上作我的秘书
I've appointed him as my secretary at the conference.

480
00:36:35,645 --> 00:36:39,138
他很高兴地帮助我做准备
He's been jolly thorough in helping me to prepare.

481
00:36:47,198 --> 00:36:51,984
我也知道拜托你的这件事  有点不合规矩
I realize this is a somewhat irregular thing to ask you to do.

482
00:36:52,328 --> 00:36:54,695
我很高兴能帮上您的忙
I'd be glad to be of any assistance.

483
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:56,739
我很不好意思说起这事
I'm sorry to bring this up

484
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,774
但是这事一直萦绕在我心头
but I just can't see how on earth to make it go away.

485
00:37:01,588 --> 00:37:04,205
你对大自然基本原理知识很熟悉  对吧
You are familiar with the facts of life?

486
00:37:04,507 --> 00:37:06,833
-什么   -大自然基本原理
-My lord? -The facts of life.

487
00:37:07,135 --> 00:37:09,804
鸟儿啊  蜜蜂啊等等  你很熟悉  对吧
Birds, bees. You are familiar, aren't you?

488
00:37:11,848 --> 00:37:13,840
我不太理解老爷您的意思
I'm afraid I don't quite follow you.

489
00:37:13,933 --> 00:37:16,551
那我说的直白一点
Let me put my cards on the table.

490
00:37:16,811 --> 00:37:20,304
最近我忙于准备这次会议  当然你也很忙
I'm so busy with this conference. Of course, you are too

491
00:37:21,066 --> 00:37:23,464
但是必须得有人教教他
but someone has to tell him.

492
00:37:23,777 --> 00:37:26,342
某种程度上  由你去说可能更轻松
In a way, it would be easier for you.

493
00:37:27,322 --> 00:37:28,510
不那么尴尬
Less awkward.

494
00:37:29,032 --> 00:37:31,732
我一直羞于跟他开口说这事
I'd find the task rather daunting, I'm afraid.

495
00:37:32,077 --> 00:37:35,695
可能到他结婚那天都不会说出口
I might not get to it before Reginald's wedding day.

496
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:39,490
当然这远超出了你的职责范围
Of course, this goes far beyond the call of duty.

497
00:37:44,422 --> 00:37:45,527
我会尽全力的  老爷
I shall do my best.

498
00:37:45,882 --> 00:37:49,041
谢谢你帮我  让我放心许多
I'd be grateful if you'd try. It'd be a lot off my mind.

499
00:37:49,552 --> 00:37:52,096
这事说的时候没必要手舞足蹈
There's no need to make a song and dance of it.

500
00:37:52,097 --> 00:37:53,963
就把该怎么做说出来就好
Just convey the facts.

501
00:38:12,742 --> 00:38:14,192
吓死我了  史蒂文斯
God! Stevens!

502
00:38:15,954 --> 00:38:17,445
抱歉  太抱歉了  先生
Sorry. Most sorry, sir

503
00:38:17,539 --> 00:38:20,948
我有些重要的事向您转达
but I do have something to convey to you rather urgently.

504
00:38:21,292 --> 00:38:23,826
可以的话  我就直说了
If I may, I'll come to the point.

505
00:38:24,212 --> 00:38:29,040
不知你注意到了今天早晨池塘边的鸭子和鹅了吗
Perhaps you noticed this morning the ducks and the geese by the pond?

506
00:38:29,384 --> 00:38:31,417
鸭子和鹅  我没怎么注意到
Ducks and geese? I don't think so.

507
00:38:32,637 --> 00:38:37,089
或者鸟儿  花朵
Well, perhaps the birds and the flowers, then

508
00:38:37,308 --> 00:38:39,550
或是灌木  蜜蜂
or the shrubs, the bees

509
00:38:39,853 --> 00:38:42,178
我一个蜜蜂也没看到
I've not seen any bees.

510
00:38:42,439 --> 00:38:45,246
现在不是最好的季节说这些
It's not the best time to see them.

511
00:38:45,247 --> 00:38:46,557
什么  蜜蜂
What, the bees?

512
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:51,103
我想说的是  随着春天的到来
What I'm saying is that, with the arrival of spring

513
00:38:51,406 --> 00:38:55,347
我们将会看到周围的环境会产生
we shall see a most remarkable and profound change

514
00:38:55,702 --> 00:38:57,068
显著的巨大变化
in the surroundings.

515
00:38:57,162 --> 00:39:01,405
你说的对  现在这庭院确实没什么风景可看
I'm sure that's right. I'm sure the grounds are not at their best now.

516
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:04,826
不过我不是在欣赏这庭院的自然风光
I wasn't paying attention to the glories of nature

517
00:39:05,128 --> 00:39:07,328
因为我是在担心
because it's worrying

518
00:39:07,547 --> 00:39:11,666
那个杜邦来的时候脸色很差  这是谁也不想的
Dupont D'Ivry has arrived in a foul mood, the last thing anyone wants.

519
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,973
杜邦先生已经来了
M. Dupont D'Ivry has arrived?

520
00:39:13,974 --> 00:39:16,003
半小时前  脸色很差
Half an hour ago, in a foul mood.

521
00:39:16,347 --> 00:39:20,883
这样的话  不好意思  我最好先去看看
In that case, excuse me. I'd better go and attend to him.

522
00:39:21,102 --> 00:39:23,636
很高兴跟你谈话
Right you are. Kind of you to talk to me.

523
00:39:23,938 --> 00:39:28,349
不客气  先生  我还有一些话想传达给你
Not at all. I've one or two words more to convey on the topic of

524
00:39:28,443 --> 00:39:30,810
关于如您说所的
as you put it most admirably

525
00:39:31,071 --> 00:39:32,395
大自然的风光
the glories of nature.

526
00:39:32,572 --> 00:39:35,054
但似乎得另找时间了
But it must wait for another occasion.

527
00:39:35,366 --> 00:39:38,359
我很期待下次谈话  但我更喜欢谈论钓鱼
I'll look forward to it. But I'm more of a fish man.

528
00:39:38,703 --> 00:39:40,444
-鱼   -我非常喜欢钓鱼
-Fish? -I know all about fish.

529
00:39:40,705 --> 00:39:42,029
淡水鱼和海水鱼
Freshwater and salt.

530
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:46,701
所有的生物对于我们的话题都是有意义的
All living creatures would be relevant to our discussion.

531
00:39:47,045 --> 00:39:51,122
抱歉  我不知道杜邦先生已经到了
Excuse me. I had no idea that Monsieur Dupont D'Ivry had arrived.

532
00:39:51,341 --> 00:39:52,363
谢谢
Thank you.

533
00:40:03,853 --> 00:40:05,845
有什么可以效劳的  先生
May I be of assistance, sir?

534
00:40:06,272 --> 00:40:07,847
太好了  是管家
Oh, the butler.

535
00:40:08,316 --> 00:40:13,227
我的脚发炎了  请给我一盆热水和盐
I have sore feet, so I need a basin with warm water and salts, please.

536
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:16,439
我会去找女管家安排的  先生
I'll arrange that with the housekeeper, sir.

537
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:20,610
热水和盐  尽快
Warm water and salts as soon as possible.

538
00:40:23,665 --> 00:40:25,823
你好  我也会说英语
How do you do? But I speak English.

539
00:40:26,084 --> 00:40:27,967
好极了  我很幸运
Good. That's lucky for me.

540
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:30,536
我是杰克?刘易斯  美国的代表
I'm Jack Lewis, the U.S. delegate.

541
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,955
我们能私下谈谈吗
Could we speak privately soon?

542
00:40:33,216 --> 00:40:34,165
当然
Yes, of course.

543
00:40:34,426 --> 00:40:39,337
但是因为他们强迫我去观光弄的我脚底全是水泡
But I have blisters due to some sightseeing they made me do in London.

544
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:41,923
知道吗  我之前早就看过伦敦塔了
I had already seen the Tower of London.

545
00:40:43,476 --> 00:40:46,719
我发现事情并没有如我预料的
I've discovered that things are not moving

546
00:40:47,063 --> 00:40:50,348
向您所希望的方向发展
in a direction that I think you would approve of.

547
00:41:45,163 --> 00:41:48,531
重整德国军备需要被大家所认可
German rearmament is a fact to be accepted.

548
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:52,243
我们都希望看到的是一个自由和平等的德国
It's in our own interest to have a free and equal Germany.

549
00:41:52,337 --> 00:41:54,162
而不是一个被
Not a prostrate nation

550
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:58,072
16年前的不平等条约压垮的德国
upon whom an unfair peace treaty was imposed 16 years ago.

551
00:41:58,343 --> 00:42:00,168
那些像我一样曾去过德国的在座各位
Those who've been in Germany

552
00:42:00,428 --> 00:42:05,381
应该感到激动  因为我们看到了德国重生的希望
can only thrill, as I have, to the signs of rebirth.

553
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:10,011
为了帮助德国恢复国内经济
-to assist Germany in her virile struggle for economic recovery

554
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:14,849
包括提供日常补给和相当的军备
including support for her fair demand for equality of armaments

555
00:42:15,151 --> 00:42:18,269
以及对德国青年提供全球性的兵役政策
and universal military service for German youth.

556
00:42:18,947 --> 00:42:22,315
如果我们  在战后的欧洲
If we, in postwar Europe

557
00:42:22,534 --> 00:42:27,361
再给我弄一盆水泡脚
I need more water. I need another basin to bathe my feet.

558
00:42:27,664 --> 00:42:28,529
跟我来  先生
Follow me, sir.

559
00:42:39,217 --> 00:42:41,042
-我们必须得谈谈  -这边请  先生
-We have to talk. -This way, sir.

560
00:42:52,814 --> 00:42:55,492
我的朋友  我现在很痛
My friend, I am in agony.

561
00:42:55,493 --> 00:42:57,965
鞋子太紧了  都怪我自己
Too tight shoes. I blame myself.

562
00:42:58,194 --> 00:42:59,727
虚荣心
Vanity.

563
00:43:01,281 --> 00:43:05,274
我们必须得做些什么来制约德国
We must do some fast maneuvering to restrain the Germans.

564
00:43:05,577 --> 00:43:07,568
请这边请  先生们
Please come this way, gentlemen.

565
00:43:16,671 --> 00:43:20,498
管家  你可以帮我把鞋子脱下吗
Butler, please, could you help me with my feet-shoe?

566
00:43:20,842 --> 00:43:22,875
当然
-Yes, of course. -Take it off.

567
00:43:23,011 --> 00:43:28,078
你也听到他们说的关于等量的军备和军事设施
What they said about equality of arms for Germany, military service-

568
00:43:29,309 --> 00:43:31,342
-抱歉  先生  -我去去就来
-Sorry, sir. -I'll manage.

569
00:43:31,394 --> 00:43:32,385
什么事
What?

570
00:43:37,817 --> 00:43:40,518
您父亲病了  先生
Your father's been taken ill, sir.

571
00:43:40,737 --> 00:43:43,980
-他在哪里   -在中式卧室门外
-Where? -Outside the Chinese bedroom, sir.

572
00:43:44,324 --> 00:43:48,943
德国跟我们一样也在寻求和平
Germany wants peace as much as we do. She needs peace.

573
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,154
让我来帮你
Here, let me help you with that.

574
00:43:55,001 --> 00:43:56,159
谢谢
Thank you.

去准备一盆热水和盐
Take a basin of hot water and salts

577
00:44:15,063 --> 00:44:18,431
给台球室里的杜邦先生送去  清楚了没
to Mr. D'Ivry in the billiards room. Is that understood?

578
00:44:18,733 --> 00:44:20,933
-是的  史蒂文斯先生  -很好  去吧
-Yes, Mr. Stevens. -Good. Do it.

579
00:44:40,755 --> 00:44:41,777
父亲
Father?

580
00:45:26,968 --> 00:45:29,598
我比你更有时间来照看你父亲
I have more time than you to look after him.

581
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:30,826
我已经叫了医生
I've called the doctor.

582
00:45:31,181 --> 00:45:32,369
谢谢  肯顿小姐
Thank you, Miss Kenton.

583
00:45:43,777 --> 00:45:45,935
恐怕你父亲不太好
Your father's not so good, I'm afraid.

584
00:45:48,656 --> 00:45:51,732
如果病情恶化  请通知我
If he deteriorates, call me, will you?

585
00:45:52,035 --> 00:45:53,484
他多大了  70还是72
How old is he? 70, 72?

586
00:45:53,828 --> 00:45:55,570
-75  -我明白了
-75, sir. -I see.

587
00:45:56,289 --> 00:46:00,283
-病情恶化就通知我  -我会的  谢谢医生
-If he deteriorates, let me know. -I will, sir. Thank you, doctor.

588
00:46:31,241 --> 00:46:33,608
稳当一点  别太快
More haste, less speed.

589
00:46:54,097 --> 00:46:56,464
缺了什么东西
There's something missing.

590
00:46:57,434 --> 00:46:58,216
什么东西
What is it?

591
00:46:58,518 --> 00:47:01,187
-佐料架上的调羹  生生  -很好
-The spoon from the cruet set, sir. -Good.

592
00:47:02,522 --> 00:47:03,596
看的很仔细
Well observed.

593
00:47:04,357 --> 00:47:07,683
不要去碰杯子的杯沿
Now, never touch the lip of the glass.

594
00:47:10,071 --> 00:47:10,853
很好
Good.

595
00:47:16,369 --> 00:47:17,902
先放杯子  然后
Glass first, and then

596
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:26,442
楼下一切都好吗
Is everything in hand downstairs?

597
00:47:28,047 --> 00:47:31,165
我们在准备会议期间的最后一顿晚餐
We're preparing the last dinner of the conference.

598
00:47:32,135 --> 00:47:34,085
你可以想象到厨房手忙脚乱的样子
You can imagine the kitchen.

599
00:47:34,304 --> 00:47:36,963
但是一切都在掌握中吗
But is everything in hand?

600
00:47:36,964 --> 00:47:38,673
是的  情况良好
Yes, I think we're up to scratch.

601
00:47:38,975 --> 00:47:41,540
你觉得好些了吗
Are you feeling any better?

602
00:47:44,647 --> 00:47:46,806
有些事我要告诉你
There's something I have to tell you.

603
00:47:48,943 --> 00:47:52,520
我有很多事要忙  明早再说吧
I have so much to do. Why don't we talk in the morning?

604
00:47:52,822 --> 00:47:53,813
吉姆
Jim

605
00:47:55,617 --> 00:47:58,015
我不爱你的母亲
I fell out of love with your mother.

606
00:48:00,121 --> 00:48:01,779
我曾经爱过她
I loved her once.

607
00:48:02,749 --> 00:48:07,577
当我不再爱她的时候  发现
The love went out of me when I found her carrying on.

608
00:48:10,799 --> 00:48:12,540
她怀孕了
A good son.

609
00:48:13,927 --> 00:48:15,501
但是我以你为傲
Proud of you.

610
00:48:18,389 --> 00:48:20,756
我希望自己是个好父亲
I hope I've been a good father.

611
00:48:22,685 --> 00:48:24,719
我尽力了
I tried me best.

612
00:48:35,365 --> 00:48:37,815
你现在最好下去了
You better get down there

613
00:48:38,493 --> 00:48:42,945
否则他们会乱成一锅粥的
or heaven only knows what they'll be up to.

614
00:48:55,135 --> 00:48:56,459
去吧
Go on.

615
00:48:58,179 --> 00:48:59,285
去吧
Go on!

616
00:49:01,808 --> 00:49:03,883
我早上再来看你
We'll talk in the morning.

617
00:49:18,867 --> 00:49:21,692
在我们会议的最后一天
On the last day of our conference

618
00:49:21,995 --> 00:49:25,853
请允许我表达诚挚的谢意
permit me to say how impressed I have been

619
00:49:26,082 --> 00:49:31,150
感谢在座各位所表现出的友善
with the spirit of goodwill that has prevailed.

620
00:49:31,796 --> 00:49:34,163
同时也是也是对德国的友善
Goodwill for Germany.

621
00:49:34,257 --> 00:49:36,374
让我感动得几乎流泪的是
And with tears in my eyes

622
00:49:36,634 --> 00:49:39,627
我看到了各位都公认了
I see that everyone here has recognized

623
00:49:39,888 --> 00:49:44,590
我们德国再一次屹立于强国之林
our right to be, once again, a strong nation.

624
00:49:45,685 --> 00:49:48,219
我从心底里想对大家说
With my hand on my heart, I declare

625
00:49:48,688 --> 00:49:50,638
德国需要和平
that Germany needs peace

626
00:49:50,899 --> 00:49:54,590
渴望和平
and desires only peace.

627
00:49:55,487 --> 00:49:58,104
与英国的和平
Peace with England

628
00:49:58,239 --> 00:50:00,523
还有与法国的和平
and peace with France.

629
00:50:06,539 --> 00:50:08,156
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

630
00:50:12,712 --> 00:50:15,913
我也同样被感动了
I, too, have been impressed

631
00:50:16,382 --> 00:50:18,833
是的  深深地被感动了
yes, deeply impressed

632
00:50:19,052 --> 00:50:23,504
被会议上这种渴望和平的真诚的心所打动
by the genuine desire for peace manifested at this conference.

633
00:50:24,933 --> 00:50:27,091
不像我们的美国同盟
Unlike our American colleague

634
00:50:27,393 --> 00:50:30,511
我们欧洲人深知战争的恐怖
we in Europe know the horrors of war.

635
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:36,017
不论我们是法国人  英国人  意大利人或是德国人
And whether we are French or English or Italian or German

636
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:40,479
我们共同的愿望都是不想再次经历战争的伤痛
our one desire is to never have to experience them again.

637
00:50:41,282 --> 00:50:42,106
确实是这样
Indeed.

638
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:45,234
让我印象深刻  或者说是被感动的是
Impressed, or I may say touched

639
00:50:45,578 --> 00:50:49,270
大家的表现出的善意和友谊
by the words of goodwill and friendship I have heard

640
00:50:49,749 --> 00:50:53,117
我向大家承诺  我会尽我最大的努力
I promise you that I shall do my utmost

641
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,536
来转变我国对德国的政策
to change my country's policy

642
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:58,456
虽然她曾是一个战败国
towards that nation which was once our foe

643
00:50:58,675 --> 00:51:01,125
但是现在  我敢于说
but is now, I may venture to say

644
00:51:01,469 --> 00:51:02,376
她是我们的朋友
our friend.

645
00:51:21,406 --> 00:51:22,772
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen

646
00:51:23,366 --> 00:51:27,109
美国跟各位一样也不想要战争
the United States doesn't want war any more than you do.

647
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:31,113
但是另一方面  我们也不想用任何的代价来换取和平
On the other hand, neither do we want peace at any price

648
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:34,127
因为有些所谓的代价
because some prices, you may find

649
00:51:34,335 --> 00:51:37,119
无比巨大
are too outrageously high to pay.

650
00:51:37,255 --> 00:51:40,873
但是先不说这些  不久就知道了
But let's not get into that now. We may have to soon enough.

651
00:51:41,176 --> 00:51:44,867
现在  让我们举起酒杯敬达林顿公爵
For the moment, let us raise our glasses to Lord Darlington

652
00:51:45,221 --> 00:51:48,089
感谢他的热情好客
in gratitude for his magnificent hospitality.

653
00:52:02,197 --> 00:52:06,482
达林顿公爵是一个老派的英国绅士
Lord Darlington is a classic English gentleman of the old school.

654
00:52:07,494 --> 00:52:11,112
体面  受人尊敬  非常好心
Decent and honorable and well-meaning.

655
00:52:11,414 --> 00:52:15,356
在座各位也都是体面  受尊敬  好心的绅士
So are all of you. All decent, honorable and well-meaning gentlemen.

656
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:19,162
非常荣幸能在这里遇到各位
It's a pleasure and a privilege to visit with you here.

657
00:52:19,923 --> 00:52:20,788
但是
But

658
00:52:21,382 --> 00:52:23,541
很抱歉这么说
now, excuse me, I must say this

659
00:52:23,802 --> 00:52:26,669
你们都是业余的
you are, all of you, amateurs.

660
00:52:27,639 --> 00:52:32,175
国际政治事务不该由你们这样的绅士来管理
And international affairs should never be run by gentlemen amateurs.

661
00:52:32,477 --> 00:52:36,888
你们一点也不知道这个世界正在变成什么样
Do you have any idea of what sort of a place the world is becoming?

662
00:52:37,607 --> 00:52:41,100
用你们高尚的作派来管理的世界已经不复存在了
The days when you could act out of noble instincts are over.

663
00:52:41,403 --> 00:52:45,938
欧洲现在是权利政治的舞台  是现实的政治
Europe has become the arena of Realpolitik, the politics of reality.

664
00:52:46,074 --> 00:52:49,233
不管你喜不喜欢  是真正的政治
If you like, real politics.

665
00:52:50,036 --> 00:52:52,760
你们要讨论的不是像理想化的政治
What you need is not gentlemen politicians,

666
00:52:52,761 --> 00:52:54,363
而是现实世界中的政治
but real ones.

667
00:52:54,457 --> 00:52:58,367
你们需要专家来出谋划策  否则你们只会引致灾难
You need professionals, or you're headed for disaster.

668
00:52:59,045 --> 00:53:01,579
绅士们  请举杯
So I propose a toast, gentlemen

669
00:53:01,798 --> 00:53:03,539
向我们的专家致敬
to the professionals.

670
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:16,093
我不希望大家在相聚的最后一晚
Well, I've no wish to enter into a quarrel

671
00:53:16,312 --> 00:53:18,179
陷入争论之中
on our last evening together.

672
00:53:18,398 --> 00:53:22,642
但是让我说一句  你所描述的业余政治家
But let me say this. What you describe as amateurism

673
00:53:22,986 --> 00:53:26,844
是我们在场的所有人都引以为傲的
is what I think most of us here still prefer to call honour.

674
00:53:27,782 --> 00:53:31,609
肯顿小姐想对你说句话  关于您的父亲
Miss Kenton would like to see you concerning your father.

675
00:53:32,746 --> 00:53:36,520
我猜您的专业  更意味着贪婪和权利
I suggest that your professionalism means greed and power

676
00:53:37,333 --> 00:53:41,077
而不是这个世界所需要的正义和公平
rather than to see justice and goodness prevail in the world.

677
00:53:41,671 --> 00:53:45,915
我毫不保留地告诉各位
I've never concealed from myself that what we were asking of Germany

678
00:53:46,217 --> 00:53:50,711
这是我们国家的传统  谢谢
is a complete break from the tradition of this country. Thank you.

679
00:54:03,109 --> 00:54:05,309
史蒂文斯先生  我很抱歉
Mr. Stevens, I'm very sorry.

680
00:54:05,779 --> 00:54:08,896
您父亲几分钟前过世了
Your father passed away four minutes ago.

681
00:54:09,491 --> 00:54:10,898
我明白了
Oh, I see.

682
00:54:11,868 --> 00:54:13,651
我很抱歉
I'm so very sorry.

683
00:54:15,163 --> 00:54:17,832
我希望能说些什么来安慰您
I wish there was something I could say.

684
00:54:19,084 --> 00:54:20,950
您能上楼去看看他吗
Will you come up and see him?

685
00:54:21,252 --> 00:54:25,371
我现在很忙  也许过一会能去看看
Well, I'm very busy at the moment. In a little while, perhaps.

686
00:54:26,216 --> 00:54:29,907
这样的话  请允许我合上他的双眼
In that case, will you permit me to close his eyes?

687
00:54:30,261 --> 00:54:33,045
实在感激不尽  谢谢
I would be most grateful. Thank you.

688
00:54:41,064 --> 00:54:45,808
我父亲肯定希望我把工作做好  我不能让他失望
My father would wish me to carry on. I can't let him down.

689
00:54:45,985 --> 00:54:47,977
是的  当然
No. Of course.

690
00:56:03,855 --> 00:56:06,848
我很想继续那次的谈话
I'd really like to continue our little chat sometime.

691
00:56:07,317 --> 00:56:08,683
关于大自然
About nature.

692
00:56:09,319 --> 00:56:13,010
你是对的  我应该在万物复苏的时候回来看看
You're right. I should come back when everything's burgeoning.

693
00:56:13,323 --> 00:56:14,647
是的  先生
Yes, sir. Indeed.

694
00:56:15,033 --> 00:56:18,891
我之前说过  我最大的兴趣是钓鱼
As I said before, my main interest has always been in fish.

695
00:56:19,245 --> 00:56:23,072
我小时候在鱼缸里养了一条热带鱼
When I was small, I kept tropical fish in a tank.

696
00:56:23,416 --> 00:56:25,658
我非常狂热地爱好它们
I harboured quite a passion for them.

697
00:56:26,544 --> 00:56:28,995
再给我倒一点酒吧
I'll have another drop of that, if you don't mind.

698
00:56:30,173 --> 00:56:31,278
你还好吧
You all right?

699
00:56:32,342 --> 00:56:33,614
我非常好
I'm perfectly all right.

700
00:56:33,927 --> 00:56:35,459
没有觉得不舒服吗
Not feeling unwell?

701
00:56:35,762 --> 00:56:38,296
没有  先生  只是有点累了
No, sir. A little tired, perhaps.

702
00:56:59,202 --> 00:57:00,474
太美妙了
Wonderful!

703
00:57:00,662 --> 00:57:05,072
您带来的德国音乐真是太美妙了
What a beautiful example of German culture you've brought to this house.

704
00:57:05,875 --> 00:57:07,033
您唱的很好
Very nice.

705
00:57:08,837 --> 00:57:10,870
但愿我没有让您难堪
I hope there's no hard feelings.

706
00:57:10,964 --> 00:57:12,705
我亲爱的伙伴
Oh, my dear good chap.

707
00:57:13,007 --> 00:57:15,004
真想跟你好好地干一架
I like a good, clean fight.

708
00:57:15,005 --> 00:57:17,168
打人的和被打的都能乐呵呵的
Giving as good as one gets, what?

709
00:57:17,387 --> 00:57:20,963
我十分尊崇英国这个国家  我非常热爱这里
I have the greatest respect for the English. I love it here.

710
00:57:21,266 --> 00:57:24,550
我小时候跟家里人来过这儿  所以感觉像在家里一样
My family brought us here as kids, so I feel at home.

711
00:57:24,894 --> 00:57:26,083
不管怎样  谢谢
Anyway, thank you.

712
00:57:26,604 --> 00:57:27,595
失陪
Excuse me.

713
00:57:29,441 --> 00:57:30,713
你没事吧
You all right?

714
00:57:31,776 --> 00:57:33,351
非常好  老爷
Yes, perfect, my lord.

715
00:57:35,613 --> 00:57:38,095
你着凉了还是怎么了
You coming down with a cold or something?

716
00:57:39,617 --> 00:57:40,942
只是一天下来比较累
It's been a long day.

717
00:57:41,161 --> 00:57:44,278
对你我来说都是累人的一天
It's been a hard day for both of us.

718
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:45,905
你做的很好
Well done.

719
00:58:12,776 --> 00:58:14,517
请节哀
My condolences.

720
00:58:14,861 --> 00:58:19,897
一次严重的中风  他没有遭受太多的痛苦
It was a stroke. A severe stroke. He wouldn't have suffered much pain.

721
00:58:20,241 --> 00:58:21,983
谢谢您告知我
Thank you for telling me.

722
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:50,052
有个外国先生正好身体不适
There's a distinguished foreign gentleman in the billiard room

723
00:58:50,396 --> 00:58:51,585
需要您去看一下
in need of attention.

724
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:52,889
很紧急吗
Urgent?

725
00:58:53,108 --> 00:58:54,432
他的脚
His feet.

726
00:58:54,943 --> 00:58:56,131
脚
Feet?

727
00:58:59,155 --> 00:59:02,190
-我带您去见他  -但愿是很紧急
-I'll take you to him. -If it's urgent.

728
00:59:02,909 --> 00:59:05,651
非常紧急  这位先生处于疼痛之中
It is urgent. The gentleman is in pain.

729
00:59:07,705 --> 00:59:09,071
请节哀
My condolences.

730
00:59:09,416 --> 00:59:11,897
谢谢  肯顿小姐  您真是非常好心
Thank you. That is most kind of you.

731
00:59:47,412 --> 00:59:48,569
下午好
Good afternoon.

732
00:59:48,872 --> 00:59:52,281
我叫史蒂文斯  我来取我的信
My name is Stevens. I'm hoping there's a letter for me.

733
00:59:52,876 --> 00:59:55,952
-我帮您找找  -詹姆斯?史蒂文斯
-I'll just check for you, sir. -James Stevens.

734
00:59:58,089 --> 01:00:01,415
-我还想要两个苹果  -给您  史蒂文斯先生
-I'd like two apples, please. -There you are, Mr. Stevens.

735
01:00:02,010 --> 01:00:03,711
您是在旅游吗
You are touring in these parts?

736
01:00:03,712 --> 01:00:05,753
我正在去克利夫顿的路上
I'm on my way to Clevedon.

737
01:00:06,055 --> 01:00:09,215
-多少钱   -三便士
-How much is that? -That'll be threepence, please.

738
01:00:09,476 --> 01:00:11,509
您是哪里来的
And you'd be coming from ?

739
01:00:11,895 --> 01:00:13,427
-牛津郡  -靠近什么地方
-Oxfordshire. -Whereabouts?

740
01:00:14,063 --> 01:00:16,764
什么   -靠近牛津郡的什么地方
-Sorry? -Whereabouts in Oxfordshire?

741
01:00:17,025 --> 01:00:17,890
达林顿
Darlington.

742
01:00:18,359 --> 01:00:21,936
好像有点耳熟  是不是有个达林顿公爵
That rings a bell. Wasn't there a Lord Darlington? Some sort

743
01:00:22,238 --> 01:00:24,063
是个纳粹  把英国带进了二战的
of Nazi, got us in the war?

744
01:00:25,408 --> 01:00:27,973
我是那里的管家  我的雇主是
I'm the butler there, and my employer

745
01:00:28,036 --> 01:00:30,319
刘易斯先生  一位美国绅士
is Mr. Lewis, an American gentleman.

746
01:00:32,832 --> 01:00:34,866
我对前一任屋主不熟
I didn't know the former owner.

747
01:00:36,336 --> 01:00:37,358
您的找零
Your change.

748
01:00:57,941 --> 01:01:02,476
我在海景饭店订了位子  就在码头对面
I should be glad to meet you at the Sea View Hotel, opposite the pier.

749
01:01:02,821 --> 01:01:07,106
我们真是有太多要谈论了  我也有很多的问题
We'll have such a lot to talk about, and I'll have many questions.

750
01:01:07,409 --> 01:01:11,527
除了您之外  我跟达林顿府上的朋友都失去了联系
Ex cept for you, I've lost touch with all our friends at Darlington Hall.

751
01:01:11,788 --> 01:01:12,810
但这是毫无疑问的
But that's no wonder.

752
01:01:12,997 --> 01:01:16,741
过了这么多年  发生了这么多事
It was long ago and a lot has happened in between.

753
01:01:17,168 --> 01:01:21,245
怎么可能跟所有人都保持联系呢
Who could keep track of all the people His Lordship once employed?

754
01:01:21,589 --> 01:01:22,997
老爷您找我
My lord, you rang?

755
01:01:23,258 --> 01:01:25,271
年轻的德国女士到了吗
Have the young German ladies arrived?

756
01:01:25,272 --> 01:01:26,709
是的  她们在外面
They're outside.

757
01:01:27,053 --> 01:01:29,962
我想跟她们问个好  练练我的德语
I'd like to say hello to them, practise my German.

758
01:01:30,265 --> 01:01:34,509
-她们的英语也说的很好  -很好  叫她们进来
-They do speak excellent English. -Good. Well, ask them to come in.

759
01:01:46,698 --> 01:01:48,981
这是艾尔莎  这是厄尔玛
This is Elsa and this is Irma.

760
01:01:51,703 --> 01:01:53,486
我在询问她们的旅途是否顺利
I'm asking about their journey.

761
01:01:56,624 --> 01:01:58,241
路途很长  老爷
It was long, my lord.

762
01:02:03,882 --> 01:02:05,498
我问她们是否喜欢这里的天气
I asked if they like the weather.

763
01:02:05,759 --> 01:02:09,794
我们很感激您  能让我们来这里
We are grateful to you, my lord, for letting us come here.

764
01:02:11,389 --> 01:02:13,589
我们的父母非常感激您
Our parents are very grateful.

765
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:16,884
不用客气  肯顿小姐会照顾好你们的
Not at all. Miss Kenton will look after you.

766
01:02:17,187 --> 01:02:18,845
-对吧  -当然  老爷
-Won't you? -Indeed, my lord.

767
01:02:19,189 --> 01:02:20,377
欢迎来到达林顿府
Welcome to Darlington Hall.

768
01:02:22,692 --> 01:02:25,142
谢谢  老爷
-Thank you, my lord. -Thank you, my lord.

769
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:29,063
-还有别的事吗   -没了
Will there be anything else?

770
01:02:55,016 --> 01:02:56,038
杰弗瑞先生
Sir Geoffrey.

771
01:02:57,685 --> 01:02:59,093
很高兴见到您
Good to see you.

772
01:02:59,854 --> 01:03:01,179
您好
How do you do?

773
01:03:01,815 --> 01:03:03,087
请进
Well, come in.

774
01:03:04,275 --> 01:03:06,017
-班恩先生  -史蒂文斯先生
-Mr. Benn. -Mr. Stevens.

775
01:03:07,404 --> 01:03:10,104
先生们  在这里等一会
Gentlemen, if you'd like to wait here for a while.

776
01:03:17,831 --> 01:03:19,767
您不是在史丹顿府吗
Aren't you still at Stanton Lacey?

777
01:03:19,768 --> 01:03:21,866
我现在是杰弗瑞爵士的管家
I'm with Sir Geoffrey now.

778
01:03:22,961 --> 01:03:25,578
-您一点也没变  -您上去吧
-You haven't changed one bit. -I'll let you get on.

779
01:03:25,922 --> 01:03:28,404
-有机会再聊  -期待如此
-Perhaps we'll meet later. -I hope so.

780
01:03:30,552 --> 01:03:35,588
先生们  你们谈论着犹太人  吉普赛人  黑人等等
But, gentlemen, you speak of Jews and Gypsies, Negroes and so forth.

781
01:03:36,182 --> 01:03:39,842
但是你们也该看到法西斯的种族法律
But one has to regard the racial laws of the Fascists

782
01:03:40,103 --> 01:03:43,679
也是一种公共卫生措施  在我看来
as a sanitary measure, much overdue, in my opinion.

783
01:03:43,982 --> 01:03:47,141
想象如果要在这个国家推行这样的法令
Imagine trying to enforce such a rule in this country-

784
01:03:47,193 --> 01:03:50,478
没有一套刑罚体系是不可能的
You cannot run a country without a penal system.

785
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:53,345
在这里我们称之为监狱
Here we call them prisons.

786
01:03:53,346 --> 01:03:55,483
那里他们称之为集中营
There, they call them concentration camps.

787
01:03:56,578 --> 01:03:59,143
史蒂文斯  这汤里有什么肉吗
Is there any meat of any kind in this soup?

788
01:03:59,456 --> 01:04:01,531
这是蘑菇汤料  先生
I think it's mushroom stock, sir.

789
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:05,691
蘑菇  洋葱以及芹菜  完全没有肉
Mushroom ends and skins, onion and celery. No meat at all.

790
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,830
煮的时候加了点雪利酒
Cold water, and then cook adds sherry.

791
01:04:09,299 --> 01:04:13,125
我听说您的选区里有工党派人士
I hear you have a Labour fellow from your constituency.

792
01:04:13,219 --> 01:04:17,380
但是在德国  他们已经摆脱了工会的束缚
Over there, they've got rid of all that trade union rubbish.

793
01:04:17,557 --> 01:04:21,332
没有一个工人会在德国搞罢工
Believe me, no workers strike in Germany.

794
01:04:21,561 --> 01:04:23,636
每个人都十分遵守秩序
And everyone's kept in line.

795
01:04:23,897 --> 01:04:26,848
难怪我们的国家在走下破路
No wonder this country is going down the drain.

796
01:04:27,192 --> 01:04:29,392
是从内部蔓延出来的问题
It is internally diseased.

797
01:04:29,694 --> 01:04:32,937
面包块里有黄油  你知道吗
I think there may be butter in the croutons. Do you know?

798
01:04:33,031 --> 01:04:35,189
恐怕是的
I'm afraid there may be.

799
01:04:46,377 --> 01:04:48,661
你这里还蛮舒适的
You've made a cozy little nest here.

800
01:04:48,838 --> 01:04:51,622
在我看来  你是个十分心满意足的人
Seems to me you must be a well-contented man.

801
01:04:54,427 --> 01:04:56,544
在我看来  贝恩先生
In my philosophy, Mr. Benn

802
01:04:56,888 --> 01:04:59,370
人不能自诩心满意足
a man cannot call himself well-contented

803
01:04:59,682 --> 01:05:01,757
直到他尽自己所能
until he has done all he can

804
01:05:02,102 --> 01:05:04,302
为雇主做到应尽之事
to be of service to his employer.

805
01:05:04,479 --> 01:05:06,679
当然  这要基于这个雇主
This assumes that one's employer

806
01:05:06,981 --> 01:05:11,142
不仅在地位和财富上更优越
is a superior person not only in rank or wealth

807
01:05:11,486 --> 01:05:12,935
在道德层面也要有高的品格
but in moral stature.

808
01:05:13,238 --> 01:05:16,814
那您怎么看  楼上那帮"品格高尚之人"
And in your opinion, what's going on up there has "moral stature"?

809
01:05:17,158 --> 01:05:19,025
我希望自己也能像您那样确定
I wish I could be sure.

810
01:05:19,911 --> 01:05:20,985
但我不是
But I'm not.

811
01:05:21,162 --> 01:05:24,155
我听闻一些可疑的事情  非常可疑
I've heard some very fishy things. Very fishy.

812
01:05:24,624 --> 01:05:26,657
我什么都没听闻
I hear nothing.

813
01:05:28,962 --> 01:05:29,827
听
Listen.

814
01:05:31,297 --> 01:05:33,289
歌声多么动人啊
That's so touching, isn't it?

815
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:42,089
听那些先生们的谈话会让我工作分心
To listen to the gentlemen would distract me from my work.

816
01:05:51,317 --> 01:05:52,892
这是新鲜的苏打水
It's fresh soda.

817
01:05:57,365 --> 01:05:58,815
跟我们一起喝一杯吧
Would you be joining us?

818
01:05:59,117 --> 01:06:02,975
多谢好意  但是我明天要早起
Thank you, but it's very late and I have an early start.

819
01:06:03,246 --> 01:06:04,570
晚安
Good night.

820
01:06:04,789 --> 01:06:07,907
-晚安  史蒂文斯先生  -晚安  肯顿小姐
-Good night, Mr. Stevens. -Good night, Miss Kenton.

821
01:06:11,546 --> 01:06:13,120
漂亮的女人
Good-looking woman.

822
01:06:18,636 --> 01:06:21,671
自从她离开史丹顿府  一切都不一样了
It was never the same after she left Stanton Lacey.

823
01:06:21,973 --> 01:06:24,642
六个月后我也离开了那里
I handed in my own notice six months later.

824
01:06:26,936 --> 01:06:28,803
若没有了她  我会不知所措
I'd be lost without her.

825
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:35,226
在这样一座影响整个世界的大房子里
A first-rate housekeeper is essential in a house like this

826
01:06:35,528 --> 01:06:39,188
一个能干的女管家非常重要
where great affairs are decided between these walls.

827
01:06:44,162 --> 01:06:46,154
-早上好  -老爷
-Good morning. -My lord.

828
01:07:04,224 --> 01:07:08,426
我们对待犹太人并没有什么不公
"We do the Jews no injustice when we say that the revelation of Christ

829
01:07:08,686 --> 01:07:12,544
犹大背叛基督既让人不能理解也招致痛恨
is something incomprehensible and hateful to them.

830
01:07:12,607 --> 01:07:15,224
尽管他只是站在人群中的一个人
Though He apparently sprang from their midst

831
01:07:15,568 --> 01:07:19,020
但是他象征着他们的整个族群
He embodies the negation of their whole nature.

832
01:07:19,322 --> 01:07:22,982
犹太人对此比我们更敏感
The Jews are far more sensitive about this than we are.

833
01:07:23,159 --> 01:07:28,196
这种障碍使得欧洲人与犹太人区别开来
This demonstration of the cleft that separates us Europeans from the Jew

834
01:07:28,373 --> 01:07:31,407
并不是为了让种族主义
is not given in order to let religious prejudice

835
01:07:31,751 --> 01:07:34,452
往极端方向发展
with its dangerous bias, settle the matter

836
01:07:34,546 --> 01:07:38,372
而是基于这两个种族观念和本质的不同
but because the perception of two fundamentally different natures

837
01:07:38,633 --> 01:07:40,708
所揭示出来的现实的鸿沟
reveals a real gulf. "

838
01:08:00,155 --> 01:08:03,439
我们的仆人中有两个难民吧
We have some refugee girls on the staff now, I believe.

839
01:08:03,658 --> 01:08:04,763
是的
We do.

840
01:08:05,118 --> 01:08:07,568
两个女仆  艾尔莎和厄尔玛
Two housemaids, Elsa and Irma.

841
01:08:08,329 --> 01:08:10,696
恐怕你得把她们送走
You'll have to let them go, I'm afraid.

842
01:08:13,042 --> 01:08:14,367
让他们走吗  老爷
Let them go, my lord?

843
01:08:16,963 --> 01:08:20,081
虽然很遗憾  但也是没办法的事
It's regrettable, but we have no choice.

844
01:08:20,675 --> 01:08:23,000
你必须得顺应大环境
You must see the whole thing in context.

845
01:08:23,344 --> 01:08:26,546
我得为我的宾客们考虑
I have the well-being of my guests to consider.

846
01:08:32,103 --> 01:08:33,678
请允许我说一句
May I say

847
01:08:33,897 --> 01:08:35,888
她们工作的非常好
they work extremely well.

848
01:08:35,982 --> 01:08:39,016
她们很聪明  有礼貌又爱干净
They're intelligent, polite and very clean.

849
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:43,187
很抱歉  但我已经仔细考虑过了
I'm sorry, but I've looked into this matter very carefully.

850
01:08:43,281 --> 01:08:45,731
我可不想冒这个险
There are larger issues at stake.

851
01:08:46,326 --> 01:08:48,276
我很抱歉  就这么决定了
I'm sorry, but there it is.

852
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:51,571
她们是犹太人
They're Jews.

853
01:08:55,835 --> 01:08:56,909
是  老爷
Yes, my lord.

854
01:09:02,217 --> 01:09:04,698
我很惊讶你竟然站在这儿
I'm amazed you can stand there as if

855
01:09:05,053 --> 01:09:07,826
像个没事人似的  难以置信
you were discussing orders for the larder. I can't believe it!

856
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:12,175
艾尔莎和厄尔玛被解雇  就因为她们是犹太人
Elsa and Irma are to be dismissed because they're Jewish?

857
01:09:12,477 --> 01:09:17,013
老爷已经决定了  我和你都无权干涉
His Lordship has decided. There's nothing for you and I to discuss.

858
01:09:17,357 --> 01:09:20,600
她们没有工作的话  会被送回德国的
Without work, they could be sent back to Germany.

859
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:22,018
我也无能为力
It is out of our hands.

860
01:09:22,362 --> 01:09:26,105
如果明天您解雇这两个女孩  您就罪过了
I tell you, if you dismiss my girls tomorrow, it will be wrong!

861
01:09:26,408 --> 01:09:28,889
罪过  就像杀人放火一样的罪过
A sin, as any sin ever was one!

862
01:09:38,211 --> 01:09:42,152
这世界上有许多我和你不能理解的事
There are many things you and I don't understand in this world.

863
01:09:42,392 --> 01:09:46,594
但是老爷懂的多  也权衡过利弊
His Lordship understands fully and has studied the larger issues at stake

864
01:09:46,855 --> 01:09:48,847
关于
concerning, say

865
01:09:49,608 --> 01:09:51,516
犹太种族的本质
the nature of Jewry.

866
01:09:57,699 --> 01:09:59,357
我警告您
I warn you

867
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,735
如果她们被解雇
if those girls go

868
01:10:01,995 --> 01:10:03,945
我也辞职不干了
I shall leave this house.

869
01:10:09,002 --> 01:10:10,191
请别这样
Please.

870
01:10:30,816 --> 01:10:33,600
这封推荐信  我不得不说
These references, I have to tell you

871
01:10:33,777 --> 01:10:35,351
是有所保留的
are quite reserved.

872
01:10:36,613 --> 01:10:39,178
你为什么离开上一个雇主
Why did you leave your last employment?

873
01:10:39,574 --> 01:10:42,108
-因为他们不要我了  -为什么
-They didn't want me anymore. -Why not?

874
01:10:42,202 --> 01:10:43,943
我不知道
I don't know.

875
01:10:44,454 --> 01:10:46,321
他们就是不要我了
They just didn't want me anymore.

876
01:10:46,581 --> 01:10:48,323
他们说她工作不错
They say she works well.

877
01:10:49,418 --> 01:10:51,159
请到外面稍等一会
Would you please wait outside?

878
01:10:59,636 --> 01:11:01,920
-她不合适  -没关系  留下她
-She's unsuitable. -Not at all. I want her.

879
01:11:02,097 --> 01:11:05,048
-我会监督她的  -可她不合适
-She'll be under my supervision. -She's not suitable.

880
01:11:05,142 --> 01:11:07,467
她会做好的  我向您保证
She'll do well. I'll see to it.

881
01:11:09,229 --> 01:11:13,389
好吧  那么责任就落在您肩上了
Well, then, it is entirely your responsibility.

882
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,842
您不是因为那两个德国女孩要辞职吗
Weren't you leaving because of the German girls?

883
01:11:19,906 --> 01:11:20,980
我不走了
I'm not leaving.

884
01:11:22,784 --> 01:11:25,652
我没地方可去  我没有家
I've nowhere to go. I have no family.

885
01:11:26,455 --> 01:11:27,237
我是一个懦夫
I'm a coward.

886
01:11:28,749 --> 01:11:30,573
是的  我是一个懦夫
Yes. I am a coward.

887
01:11:31,543 --> 01:11:34,160
我害怕离开  这是事实
I'm frightened of leaving, and that's the truth.

888
01:11:35,589 --> 01:11:39,999
我所看到的外面的世界充满了孤独感  这让我害怕
All I see out in the world is loneliness, and it frightens me.

889
01:11:41,511 --> 01:11:44,629
我的做人原则也被压了下去
That's all my high principles are worth.

890
01:11:46,141 --> 01:11:47,799
我非常地惭愧
I'm ashamed of myself.

891
01:11:58,236 --> 01:12:00,770
您是这个庄园不可或缺的
You mean a great deal to this house.

892
01:12:07,371 --> 01:12:10,447
您对这个庄园非常重要
You're extremely important to this house.

893
01:12:14,461 --> 01:12:15,702
是吗
Am I?

894
01:12:22,803 --> 01:12:24,294
现在  回到正事上
Now, look here

895
01:12:24,346 --> 01:12:29,007
如果您对这个应聘者十分有信心  那么就叫她进来
if you're really sure about this young woman, call her back in.

896
01:12:45,158 --> 01:12:48,068
豪尔小姐  我们希望您下周开始工作
Miss Hull, we would like you to start next week.

897
01:12:48,286 --> 01:12:52,228
你就跟着肯顿小姐  她会跟你解释这里的规矩
You're responsible to Miss Kenton. She'll explain the house rules.

898
01:12:52,457 --> 01:12:56,034
第一条  不能有男性来访者  以及其他的
Number one: no gentlemen callers, or other such.

899
01:12:56,336 --> 01:12:57,994
-是  先生  -很好
-Yes, sir. -Good.

900
01:12:58,338 --> 01:13:00,736
-欢迎来这  -谢谢  先生
-Welcome. -Thank you, sir.

901
01:13:00,799 --> 01:13:03,166
很好  我带你去你的房间
Well done. I'll show you to your room.

902
01:13:59,149 --> 01:14:01,818
我都忘了老戴姆勒有多么耗油了
I'd forgotten how much petrol the Daimler uses.

903
01:14:02,069 --> 01:14:06,521
我敢说  这辆车绝对不适合外出旅游
It's an impractical motor to be going about the country, Mister

904
01:14:06,823 --> 01:14:10,650
我是哈里?史密斯  愿您在这里过得愉快
Smith. Harry Smith. It's a privilege to have you here in Moscombe.

905
01:14:10,827 --> 01:14:13,570
-很荣幸在这里见到您  -为健康干杯
-It's a privilege to be here. -Your health, sir.

906
01:14:13,789 --> 01:14:17,991
卡莱尔先生经常在这时会过来  他会很高兴见到您
Dr. Carlisle usually drops in around now. He'd enjoy meeting you.

907
01:14:18,251 --> 01:14:20,577
他像您一样是个绅士
He's a gentleman like yourself.

908
01:14:20,837 --> 01:14:23,163
我不知道你们所说的绅士是什么样
I don't know what you call a gentleman.

909
01:14:23,382 --> 01:14:26,541
这个国家的所有男人都可以是绅士
It's a name every man in this country has a right to.

910
01:14:26,968 --> 01:14:30,545
这就是哈里?史密斯  他的老掉牙的人生哲学
There's Harry Smith now, giving you an earful of his philosophy.

911
01:14:30,889 --> 01:14:32,213
我们英国人
We English

912
01:14:32,516 --> 01:14:36,134
擅长于表达自己的自由观点  所以形成了议会制度
have the advantage and privilege of expressing our opinions

913
01:14:36,436 --> 01:14:40,430
这就是跟希特勒打仗的原因
and voting for Parliament. That's what we fought Hitler for.

914
01:14:40,774 --> 01:14:43,475
您的工作跟政治沾边吗
Have you had much to do with politics yourself?

915
01:14:45,028 --> 01:14:49,063
不是很多  特别是这两年
Not directly as such, no, particularly in these days.

916
01:14:49,741 --> 01:14:53,735
1930年初以及战前  接触的较多
Perhaps more so in the early 1930s and just before the war.

917
01:14:54,204 --> 01:14:57,238
我大多关注于国际性的事件
My concern was more international affairs.

918
01:14:57,541 --> 01:15:00,106
还有外交政策之类的
Or foreign policy, so to speak.

919
01:15:02,004 --> 01:15:06,122
当然我也不是那种高层人物
Not that I ever held high office, mind you.

920
01:15:07,050 --> 01:15:11,294
我所接触的事情都是一些非官方的事件
No, any influence I exerted was in an unofficial capacity.

921
01:15:11,596 --> 01:15:13,213
请问  先生
Excuse me, sir.

922
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:15,507
您见过丘吉尔先生吗
Have you ever met Mr. Churchill?

923
01:15:16,893 --> 01:15:21,471
他偶尔会到庄园来  那是在1930年代
He came to the house occasionally. Again, in the early 1930s.

924
01:15:21,565 --> 01:15:23,306
他就是个残暴的战争狂
He was a bloody warmonger!

925
01:15:23,817 --> 01:15:27,894
拜托  哈里  没有他我们赢不了战争
Honestly, Harry! We wouldn't have won the war without him.

926
01:15:28,238 --> 01:15:29,562
不是说他打德国人
Not content to fight Germans,

927
01:15:29,563 --> 01:15:31,815
而是他竟然派装甲部队去镇压煤矿工人
he sent troops in against the miners.

928
01:15:34,995 --> 01:15:37,779
他确实在战争中表现出色  但他之后就该退休了
He did well in the war, but he should've stepped down.

929
01:15:38,123 --> 01:15:39,386
那么艾登首相呢
And Mr. Eden?

930
01:15:39,387 --> 01:15:41,282
他把苏伊士运河的控制权弄没了
He made a right bugger of Suez!

931
01:15:41,376 --> 01:15:44,244
我见过艾登先生几次
Yes, I met Mr. Eden. Yes, occasionally.

932
01:15:44,504 --> 01:15:46,579
您好  我是理查德?卡莱尔
How do you do? Richard Carlisle.

933
01:15:46,757 --> 01:15:49,749
您的车够倒霉的  但是很高兴见到您
Rotten luck about your car, but nice to have you.

934
01:15:50,052 --> 01:15:51,580
大家都很友好
Everyone has been most kind.

935
01:15:51,581 --> 01:15:54,129
这位先生在叙述一些国际性事件
He says he knows foreign affairs.

936
01:15:54,681 --> 01:15:56,256
是真的吗
Is that so, indeed?

937
01:15:56,641 --> 01:15:58,383
都是一些非正式的事件
In an unofficial capacity.

938
01:15:58,894 --> 01:16:02,178
-他见过丘吉尔首相  -还有艾登首相
-He knows Mr. Churchill. -And Mr. Eden.

939
01:16:02,898 --> 01:16:03,972
真的吗
Really?

940
01:16:05,233 --> 01:16:09,561
是的  这是我的荣幸能够遇到
Yes, well, it was my good fortune to have consorted

941
01:16:09,821 --> 01:16:13,940
这些影响世界历史的人物
with many men of influence from Europe and from America.

942
01:16:18,914 --> 01:16:19,936
泰勒先生
Mr. Taylor

943
01:16:20,290 --> 01:16:24,659
我想去休息了  这一天下来实在很疲惫
I really feel I ought to retire now because I'm feeling rather tired.

944
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:26,995
这也难怪  先是汽油用完了
No wonder, sir. Running out of petrol

945
01:16:27,255 --> 01:16:30,373
然后还不断地听史密斯说他的政治观点
then having to hear Smith's political opinions.

946
01:16:30,967 --> 01:16:32,459
请走这边  先生
Just step this way, sir.

947
01:16:32,636 --> 01:16:36,629
明天早上我也要去史丹布瑞  也许可以载您一程
I'm going to Stanbury in the morning. I'll give you a lift

948
01:16:36,807 --> 01:16:39,758
路上还可以给您的车加一罐汽油
and we could pick up a can of petrol on the way.

949
01:16:39,851 --> 01:16:42,214
这样会给您带来不便
I'd hate to inconvenience you.

950
01:16:42,215 --> 01:16:44,971
没关系  7点30分可以吗
Not at all. Would 7:30 suit you?

951
01:16:45,232 --> 01:16:49,225
您会喜欢跟卡莱尔先生交谈  请当心楼梯
You'll enjoy talking to Dr. Carlisle. Watch this step.

952
01:16:49,945 --> 01:16:50,967
请原谅哈里?史密斯
Excuse Harry Smith.

953
01:16:51,238 --> 01:16:54,439
他一直这样说着他的政治观点  并不是说他不对
He will go on about his politics. I don't mean he's not right.

954
01:16:54,783 --> 01:16:57,255
跟希特勒打仗是为了获得民主
Democracy is why we fought Hitler,

955
01:16:57,256 --> 01:16:59,069
我们也牺牲了很多年轻人
and we lost a few lads in this village

956
01:16:59,371 --> 01:17:00,820
包括我的儿子
including our son here.

957
01:17:02,874 --> 01:17:04,407
在敦克尔克(阵亡)
Dunkirk.

958
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,620
我去给您找条毯子
I'll get you a blanket.

959
01:17:09,131 --> 01:17:11,748
我在脸盆里留了剃须刀和肥皂
I've left a razor and soap on the basin.

960
01:17:46,710 --> 01:17:49,108
去大街上随便找个人  听听他的观点
Listen to the opinions of your man in the street.

961
01:17:49,421 --> 01:17:52,038
他们在政治上  或是别的什么问题上
They're perfectly entitled to give an opinion

962
01:17:52,382 --> 01:17:54,864
都有自己的一套观点
on politics or whatever questions-

963
01:17:55,135 --> 01:17:57,210
但他们没有资格来评论
They've got no qualifications!

964
01:17:57,471 --> 01:17:59,337
他们当然可以评论
Of course they have!

965
01:18:01,641 --> 01:18:04,342
斯宾塞先生有问题要问你
Mr. Spencer would like a word with you.

966
01:18:05,270 --> 01:18:08,054
好心人  我有个问题问你
My good man, I have a question for you.

967
01:18:09,775 --> 01:18:13,268
你是否认为美国的债务形势
Do you suppose the debt situation regarding America

968
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:16,813
是现在国际贸易减少的主要原因吗
factors significantly in the present low levels of trade?

969
01:18:17,157 --> 01:18:18,857
或者这只是一个假象
Or is this a red herring

970
01:18:19,117 --> 01:18:23,778
弃用金本位制才是最根本的原因
and the abandonment of the gold standard is the cause of the problem?

971
01:18:25,499 --> 01:18:30,034
抱歉  先生  我对您的问题无从回答
I'm sorry, sir, but I am unable to be of assistance in this matter.

972
01:18:30,337 --> 01:18:31,609
哦  太遗憾了
Oh, dear. What a pity.

973
01:18:31,922 --> 01:18:34,080
也许你可以回答我另一个问题
Perhaps you'd help us on another matter.

974
01:18:35,759 --> 01:18:37,584
你是否认为
Do you think

975
01:18:37,844 --> 01:18:42,046
欧洲的货币政策会因为法国和布尔什维克
Europe's currency problem would be alleviated by an arms agreement

976
01:18:42,599 --> 01:18:44,841
的大革命协定而缓和呢
between the French and the Bolsheviks?

977
01:18:46,728 --> 01:18:51,264
抱歉  先生  我对您的问题无从回答
I'm sorry, sir, but I'm unable to be of assistance in this matter.

978
01:18:52,776 --> 01:18:54,434
史蒂文斯  你下去吧
Very well, that'll be all.

979
01:18:54,736 --> 01:18:56,816
等一下  达林顿
One moment, Darlington,

980
01:18:56,817 --> 01:18:59,522
我还有个问题要问这个好心人
I have another question to put to our good man here.

981
01:18:59,783 --> 01:19:01,483
好心人
My good fellow

982
01:19:02,077 --> 01:19:04,694
你是否认同我们的观点
do you share our opinion

983
01:19:05,455 --> 01:19:08,907
达拉第(法国总理)最近在北非的演说
that M. Daladier's recent speech on North Africa

984
01:19:09,209 --> 01:19:10,700
其实是一个诡计
was simply a ruse

985
01:19:10,961 --> 01:19:15,580
用来破坏他们国内的人民阵线
to scupper the nationalist fringe of his own domestic party?

986
01:19:16,174 --> 01:19:20,335
抱歉  先生  我对您的这些问题都无从回答
I'm sorry, sir. I am unable to help in any of these matters.

987
01:19:20,512 --> 01:19:25,048
你们看  他无法回答这些问题
You see, our good man here is " unable to assist us in these matters. "

988
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:28,176
但是我们要知道一点
Yet we still go along with the notion

989
01:19:28,478 --> 01:19:31,846
民主使得我们国家的决策都由
that this nation's decisions be left to our good man here

990
01:19:32,149 --> 01:19:33,932
像他这样成千上万的大众所决定
and a few millions like him.

991
01:19:34,818 --> 01:19:39,104
就好像让妇联去组织一场战役一样
You may as well ask the Mothers' Union to organize a war campaign.

992
01:19:42,242 --> 01:19:43,775
谢谢  老爷  谢谢  先生
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

993
01:19:47,122 --> 01:19:49,155
您最终证明了你的观点
You certainly proved your point.

994
01:19:50,584 --> 01:19:52,867
-证明终了  -不  你没有证明
-Q.E.D., I think. -No, not at all!

995
01:19:53,170 --> 01:19:54,744
他已经证明了
Oh, yes, he has!

996
01:20:00,135 --> 01:20:04,129
您怎么看镇上的人  都是不错的家伙
What did you make of the citizens of Moscombe? Not a bad bunch.

997
01:20:04,181 --> 01:20:05,171
是的  先生
No, sir.

998
01:20:05,349 --> 01:20:08,550
泰勒夫妇非常好心
Mr. and Mrs. Taylor were extremely kind.

999
01:20:10,354 --> 01:20:14,889
请原谅我的无礼
I say, I hope you don't think me very rude

1000
01:20:15,233 --> 01:20:18,101
您的工作是不是男仆之类的
but you aren't a manservant of some sort, are you?

1001
01:20:20,822 --> 01:20:22,564
是的  您说对了
Yes, sir. I am, indeed.

1002
01:20:23,742 --> 01:20:28,027
事实上  我是达林顿府的管家  在牛津郡附近
In fact, I'm the butler of Darlington Hall, near Oxford.

1003
01:20:28,455 --> 01:20:31,156
我并不想刻意隐瞒什么
It wasn't my intention to deceive anyone.

1004
01:20:31,249 --> 01:20:33,919
不用解释  我大致能够理解
Don't explain. I can see how it happened.

1005
01:20:34,878 --> 01:20:36,411
达林顿
Darlington.

1006
01:20:37,047 --> 01:20:39,372
是不是那个达林顿公爵
Wasn't there a Lord Darlington involved

1007
01:20:39,591 --> 01:20:42,709
推行的姑息政策让我们卷进了战争
in that appeasement business that got us into the war?

1008
01:20:43,470 --> 01:20:45,868
抱歉  我不认识那个达林顿公爵
Sorry, I never knew that Lord Darlington.

1009
01:20:46,139 --> 01:20:49,758
我的雇主是一个美国人  刘易斯先生
My employer's an American gentleman, Mr. Lewis.

1010
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:56,973
达林顿公爵是那些想和希特勒谈条件的人之一
Lord Darlington was among those who tried to make a deal with Hitler.

1011
01:20:57,234 --> 01:20:59,976
战后好像还有一场官司
Then there was a case after the war

1012
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,353
他起诉一家报纸诽谤
where he sued a newspaper for libel.

1013
01:21:02,531 --> 01:21:05,648
新闻快报还是新闻时编来着
The Express, was it? News Chronicle?

1014
01:21:05,867 --> 01:21:08,693
-我不知道  先生  -不管怎样  他败诉了
-I couldn't say, sir. -Anyway, he lost.

1015
01:21:09,871 --> 01:21:13,031
他很幸运  没有以叛国罪论处
He was lucky, really, not to have been tried for treason.

1016
01:21:14,584 --> 01:21:15,857
就在那儿  前面
There it is, just ahead.

1017
01:21:32,144 --> 01:21:33,802
先生  我要坦白一件事
Sir, I must confess

1018
01:21:34,021 --> 01:21:36,690
我没有说真话
that I failed to tell you the truth.

1019
01:21:38,191 --> 01:21:40,237
我认识达林顿公爵
I did know Lord Darlington,

1020
01:21:40,238 --> 01:21:43,103
我也要说他是一个很正直的好人
and I can declare that he was a truly good man.

1021
01:21:43,196 --> 01:21:45,271
完完全全的一个绅士
A gentleman through and through

1022
01:21:45,699 --> 01:21:48,983
我为他工作了许多年
to whom I'm proud to have given my best years of service.

1023
01:21:52,789 --> 01:21:56,282
这些应该够你到下一个加油站了
That should get you to the next petrol station.

1024
01:21:57,961 --> 01:22:00,912
非常感谢  先生
Thank you very much, sir. I'm most grateful.

1025
01:22:01,381 --> 01:22:02,997
那你赞同
But did you

1026
01:22:03,091 --> 01:22:04,416
他的观点吗
share his opinions?

1027
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:05,917
谁
Who?

1028
01:22:06,303 --> 01:22:07,252
达林顿公爵
Lord Darlington.

1029
01:22:09,264 --> 01:22:11,933
我是他的管家  我的工作是为他服务
I was his butler. I was there to serve him

1030
01:22:12,267 --> 01:22:14,467
无权表示赞同和否定
not to agree or disagree.

1031
01:22:14,936 --> 01:22:16,511
你信任他
You trusted him.

1032
01:22:17,147 --> 01:22:18,972
是的  非常信任
Yes, I did. Completely.

1033
01:22:19,733 --> 01:22:22,431
他在生命的最后几年
But at the end of his life,

1034
01:22:22,432 --> 01:22:24,884
他也承认了自己的过错
he himself admitted that he'd been  mistaken.

1035
01:22:25,447 --> 01:22:29,649
他太易受人误导  还让自己陷了进去
That he'd been too gullible, and he'd let himself be taken in.

1036
01:22:29,910 --> 01:22:31,151
我明白了
I see.

1037
01:22:34,039 --> 01:22:36,489
谢谢  先生  您真是太好了
Thank you, sir. You've been most kind.

1038
01:22:46,218 --> 01:22:51,285
笔直往前  第一个路口往左
Just keep going straight up here, and turn left at the first crossroads.

1039
01:22:52,015 --> 01:22:54,924
我不想烦到您  但是我很好奇
I say, I don't want to be a bore, but I'm intrigued.

1040
01:22:55,143 --> 01:22:57,218
您自己持什么立场
Where do you stand on all that?

1041
01:22:57,437 --> 01:23:01,181
如果错误在所难免  那您自己犯过什么错吗
If a mistake was to be made, wouldn't you rather have made your own?

1042
01:23:01,984 --> 01:23:04,142
抱歉我这么好奇地问您
Forgive me for being so inquisitive.

1043
01:23:04,444 --> 01:23:05,685
没关系  先生
Not at all, sir.

1044
01:23:06,029 --> 01:23:09,022
某种程度上  我也犯过错
In a very small way, I did make my own mistake.

1045
01:23:09,366 --> 01:23:11,900
但是我可能有机会来弥补
But I might have a chance to set mine right.

1046
01:23:12,744 --> 01:23:15,987
事实上  我现在正在去弥补的路上
In fact, I'm on my way to try and do so now.

1047
01:23:18,083 --> 01:23:19,657
试试看发动
Try the ignition.

1048
01:23:23,296 --> 01:23:26,581
谢谢先生  很感谢您的帮助
Thank you, sir. I'm most grateful for your help.

1049
01:23:27,467 --> 01:23:31,294
祝好运  很高兴能和您谈话
Good luck. It's been interesting talking to you.

1050
01:24:05,339 --> 01:24:06,121
早上好
Good morning.

1051
01:24:06,465 --> 01:24:09,165
哈菲克斯公爵很满意那些银制品
Lord Halifax was impressed with the silver.

1052
01:24:09,384 --> 01:24:13,326
我告诉他都是你做的  向你献上他的赞美
I told him it was all your doing. Sent his compliments. Well done.

1053
01:24:18,226 --> 01:24:20,708
史蒂文斯  我想问你
I've been meaning to ask you

1054
01:24:20,979 --> 01:24:24,389
去年那两个犹太女仆的事
That business last year about the Jewish maids

1055
01:24:24,816 --> 01:24:27,517
是不是已经找不到她们了
I suppose there's no way of tracing them?

1056
01:24:27,861 --> 01:24:31,980
估计很难  我曾试过在萨里郡帮她们找份工
That would be difficult. I tried to get them a position in Surrey.

1057
01:24:32,115 --> 01:24:36,057
但那里只有一个空缺  她们又不想被分开
There was room only for one, and they didn't want to be separated.

1058
01:24:36,620 --> 01:24:41,281
好吧  你再试试吧  得为她们做点什么
Well, try anyway. One would like to do something for them.

1059
01:24:41,541 --> 01:24:43,700
解雇她们是错误的决定
It was wrong, what occurred.

1060
01:24:44,378 --> 01:24:47,454
我对此很自责
I'm sorry about it. Very sorry.

1061
01:24:49,841 --> 01:24:51,833
-早上好  -早上好
-Good morning. -Good morning.

1062
01:24:55,597 --> 01:24:57,380
老爷问起那两个犹太女仆
He asked about the Jewish girls.

1063
01:24:57,683 --> 01:25:00,675
-艾尔莎和厄尔玛  -他想知道她们在哪
-Elsa and Irma? -He wondered where they were.

1064
01:25:00,977 --> 01:25:03,178
他说解雇她们是错误的决定
He said it was wrong to dismiss them.

1065
01:25:03,397 --> 01:25:07,088
我记得您当初跟我一样感到沮丧
I remember you were as distressed as I was about it.

1066
01:25:07,442 --> 01:25:08,808
跟您一样
As you were?

1067
01:25:09,653 --> 01:25:13,813
您不是认为她们应该被赶走吗
You thought it was right and proper that they should be sent packing.

1068
01:25:14,866 --> 01:25:17,025
您这么说我真是太不公平了
Now, really, that is most unfair.

1069
01:25:17,369 --> 01:25:19,736
那时我也很不安  非常不安
Of course I was upset. Very much so.

1070
01:25:19,997 --> 01:25:21,946
我从不希望发生这样的事
I don't like that happening here.

1071
01:25:22,165 --> 01:25:25,239
我真希望您那时能告诉我
I wish you'd told me.

1072
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:27,368
这样我就会好受多了
It would've helped me to know you felt as I did.

1073
01:25:27,587 --> 01:25:30,747
你为什么总是把自己的感情藏的很深
Why do you always have to hide what you feel?

1074
01:25:35,835 --> 01:25:38,995
薰衣草袋都弄好了吗  很好
Have you finished the lavender bags? Good.

1075
01:25:54,948 --> 01:25:57,148
我向您承认
I take my hat off to you.

1076
01:25:57,409 --> 01:26:01,319
这女孩确实做的不错  您是对的
That girl's come along very well. You were right and I was wrong.

1077
01:26:03,290 --> 01:26:06,491
-看看你脸上的笑容  -什么笑容
-Look at that smile on your face. -What smile?

1078
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:10,328
这笑容不言而喻
That tells a story in itself.

1079
01:26:10,630 --> 01:26:12,205
您不这样想吗  史蒂文斯先生
Wouldn't you say so?

1080
01:26:13,175 --> 01:26:15,333
什么意思
What story's that?

1081
01:26:15,427 --> 01:26:17,752
她长的很漂亮  不是吗
She's a pretty girl, don't you think?

1082
01:26:18,013 --> 01:26:19,202
是吗
Is she?

1083
01:26:19,723 --> 01:26:23,664
我注意到您不雇佣漂亮女孩子
You don't like pretty girls on the staff. I've noticed.

1084
01:26:24,519 --> 01:26:28,847
看来是我们的史蒂文斯先生担心因此分神
Might it be that our Mr. Stevens fears distraction?

1085
01:26:29,316 --> 01:26:32,742
是不是因为史蒂文斯先生也是血肉之躯
Can it be that Mr. Stevens is flesh and blood

1086
01:26:32,743 --> 01:26:34,185
怕自己控制不住呢
and cannot trust himself?

1087
01:26:34,946 --> 01:26:37,188
你知道我此刻在做什么吗
You know what I'm doing?

1088
01:26:37,282 --> 01:26:40,692
你在唠唠叨叨的时候  我在神游
I'm placing my thoughts elsewhere while you chatter away.

1089
01:26:40,952 --> 01:26:43,278
为什么那种有罪似的笑容还在您脸上
Why is that guilty smile still on your face?

1090
01:26:43,497 --> 01:26:47,657
只是因为你的唠叨而感到好笑而已
Not guilty, simply amused by the nonsense you sometimes talk.

1091
01:26:47,834 --> 01:26:51,286
绝对是被我说中了  你无法正眼看她
It is a guilty smile. You can't bear to look at her.

1092
01:26:51,588 --> 01:26:54,038
所以你不想雇她  因为她太漂亮了
You didn't want her. She was too pretty.

1093
01:26:54,383 --> 01:26:55,999
算你说对了
You must be right.

1094
01:26:56,218 --> 01:26:57,834
你总是对的
You always are.

1095
01:27:08,146 --> 01:27:09,012
查理
Charlie!

1096
01:27:23,537 --> 01:27:27,113
丽兹  你不是应该在整理床铺吗
Lizzie, aren't you supposed to be turning down the beds?

1097
01:27:27,290 --> 01:27:29,856
那你最好快点
Well, you better get on with it, then.

1098
01:27:36,091 --> 01:27:39,167
你还没告诉她吗  那你得快点告诉她
Have you told her yet? You better get on with it, then.

1099
01:27:39,469 --> 01:27:41,868
我该怎么跟她说  她不会懂的
What can I say to her? She'd never understand.

1100
01:27:42,097 --> 01:27:45,507
-为什么  -她已经老了  至少30多岁
-Why not? -She's old. She must be at least 30.

1101
01:27:45,809 --> 01:27:47,342
也许她不觉得自己老呢
Perhaps she doesn't feel old.

1102
01:27:47,644 --> 01:27:51,262
你觉得她经常摘的那些花是给谁的
Who do you think those flowers are for she's been picking?

1103
01:27:51,565 --> 01:27:54,130
过来  给我个吻
Come here. Give us a kiss.

1104
01:28:06,163 --> 01:28:07,237
花儿
Flowers.

1105
01:28:08,999 --> 01:28:10,021
花儿
Flowers.

1106
01:28:11,543 --> 01:28:13,159
你在看书
You're reading.

1107
01:28:13,378 --> 01:28:15,245
这里很暗  你看得见吗
It's very dim. Can you see?

1108
01:28:15,464 --> 01:28:16,830
是的  谢谢关心
Yes, thank you.

1109
01:28:19,426 --> 01:28:21,000
你在读什么
What are you reading?

1110
01:28:21,511 --> 01:28:22,533
一本书
A book.

1111
01:28:23,805 --> 01:28:25,380
我知道  什么样的书
Yes, but what sort of book?

1112
01:28:25,682 --> 01:28:28,508
就是一本书  肯顿小姐
It's a book, Miss Kenton. A book.

1113
01:28:31,730 --> 01:28:33,179
什么书
What's the book?

1114
01:28:36,109 --> 01:28:38,059
你难道对自己看的书感到羞愧
Are you shy about your book?

1115
01:28:38,654 --> 01:28:39,978
让我看看
What is it?

1116
01:28:43,075 --> 01:28:44,399
色情书
Is it racy?

1117
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:45,681
色情书
Racy?

1118
01:28:47,245 --> 01:28:49,612
你在看一本色情书吗
Are you reading a racy book?

1119
01:28:51,625 --> 01:28:55,118
你觉得老爷的书房里会有色情书吗
Do you think racy books are to be found in His Lordship's shelves?

1120
01:28:55,420 --> 01:28:56,953
我怎么知道
How would I know?

1121
01:28:58,048 --> 01:28:59,497
是什么书
What is it?

1122
01:29:00,759 --> 01:29:03,209
让我看看  让我看看你的书
Let me see it. Let me see your book.

1123
01:29:05,305 --> 01:29:07,005
请让我一个人待着
Please leave me alone.

1124
01:29:07,307 --> 01:29:09,466
为什么不让我看看你的书
Why won't you show me your book?

1125
01:29:09,685 --> 01:29:12,302
现在是我的私人时间  您这是在干扰我
This is my private time. You're invading it.

1126
01:29:12,604 --> 01:29:13,970
是这样吗
Is that so?

1127
01:29:14,439 --> 01:29:16,765
我在干扰您的私人时间  是吗
I'm invading your private time, am I?

1128
01:29:18,402 --> 01:29:20,059
书里有什么
What's in that book?

1129
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:22,312
让我看看
Come on, let me see.

1130
01:29:23,865 --> 01:29:26,691
还是说你在保护我
Or are you protecting me? Is that what you're doing?

1131
01:29:27,869 --> 01:29:29,527
怕我被震惊到吗
Would I be shocked?

1132
01:29:31,373 --> 01:29:33,448
会给我带来心理阴影吗
Would it ruin my character?

1133
01:29:36,586 --> 01:29:38,203
让我看看
Let me see it.

1134
01:30:04,114 --> 01:30:05,438
哦  天哪
Oh, dear.

1135
01:30:06,742 --> 01:30:08,358
这书一点也不会让人感到羞耻
It's not scandalous at all.

1136
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:11,694
这只是一本多愁善感的爱情小说
It's just a sentimental old love story.

1137
01:30:23,425 --> 01:30:25,291
我读这些书
I read these books

1138
01:30:25,594 --> 01:30:27,168
还有其他的书
any books

1139
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:31,840
是为了提高我的英语知识水平
to develop my command and knowledge of the English language.

1140
01:30:31,892 --> 01:30:35,666
我读书是为了见多识广  肯顿小姐
I read to further my education, Miss Kenton.

1141
01:30:40,192 --> 01:30:42,559
我真心地请求您
I really must ask you, please

1142
01:30:43,654 --> 01:30:47,397
请不要打扰我为数不多的属于自己的时间
not to disturb the few moments I have to myself.

1143
01:31:15,394 --> 01:31:16,582
请进
Come in.

1144
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:24,601
什么事
What is it?

1145
01:31:25,112 --> 01:31:27,854
我想辞职
I'm wanting to give you my notice, please.

1146
01:31:31,493 --> 01:31:32,358
为什么
Why?

1147
01:31:34,329 --> 01:31:36,446
查理和我准备结婚
Charlie and me, we're getting married.

1148
01:31:39,167 --> 01:31:41,367
你仔细考虑过了没
Have you thought about this carefully?

1149
01:31:41,712 --> 01:31:43,787
是的  肯顿小姐
Yes, Miss Kenton, I have.

1150
01:31:45,298 --> 01:31:50,043
你在这里越做越好  而且有大好的前途
You've been getting on well here and could have a fine career before you.

1151
01:31:50,387 --> 01:31:53,171
查理和吾准备结婚
Charlie and me's getting married.

1152
01:31:53,598 --> 01:31:54,380
查理和我
Charlie and I.

1153
01:31:54,683 --> 01:31:57,352
但愿我知道该怎么对你说
I wish I knew what to say to you.

1154
01:31:57,811 --> 01:32:00,345
我见过这样的事很多次了
I've seen this happen so many times.

1155
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:04,641
年轻的女士急于结婚  最后落得失望的结局
A young girl rushing into marriage only to be disappointed in the end.

1156
01:32:04,693 --> 01:32:05,882
你们有钱吗
What about money?

1157
01:32:07,946 --> 01:32:09,270
我们没有钱
We don't have any.

1158
01:32:10,657 --> 01:32:11,846
只要有爱就行
But who cares?

1159
01:32:12,993 --> 01:32:16,903
你们慢慢会知道过穷日子是很艰难的
You'll find it's not easy to live poor.

1160
01:32:18,206 --> 01:32:19,864
但我们有彼此
We have each other.

1161
01:32:20,834 --> 01:32:22,951
人生路上不就图一个知心伴侣嘛
That's all anyone can ever need.

1162
01:32:29,092 --> 01:32:30,458
很好
Very well.

1163
01:32:31,261 --> 01:32:32,794
如果你确定的话
If you're so sure.

1164
01:32:34,765 --> 01:32:35,922
谢谢
Thank you.

1165
01:32:42,189 --> 01:32:43,461
祝好运
Good luck.

1166
01:32:56,536 --> 01:32:58,695
我们尽力了
We did all we could for them.

1167
01:32:59,289 --> 01:33:00,739
我告诉他
I told him

1168
01:33:01,416 --> 01:33:04,993
他将是一个有潜质的副管家
I had my eye on him as a possible under-butler

1169
01:33:05,128 --> 01:33:07,203
再过个一两年
in a year or so.

1170
01:33:08,965 --> 01:33:11,364
但是他自己的事自己决定
But, no, Mr. Charlie knows best.

1171
01:33:14,179 --> 01:33:16,421
她肯定会失望的
She's sure to be let down.

1172
01:33:19,810 --> 01:33:21,676
现在说这些也是无济于事了
No use crying over spilt milk.

1173
01:33:21,812 --> 01:33:25,346
况且  我们还有其他重要的事要讨论
Besides, we have far more important matters to discuss.

1174
01:33:25,649 --> 01:33:29,225
-下周的会议   -我们非得今晚谈论吗
-Next week's meeting. Now--Must we discuss it tonight?

1175
01:33:29,569 --> 01:33:30,643
什么
Sorry?

1176
01:33:33,156 --> 01:33:36,191
我很累了
I'm tired.

1177
01:33:37,244 --> 01:33:40,320
您看不出来  我今天忙了一整天吗
I've had a busy day. Don't you realize that?

1178
01:33:41,540 --> 01:33:43,114
我非常累
I'm very tired.

1179
01:33:43,583 --> 01:33:45,784
我非常  非常累了
I'm very, very tired.

1180
01:33:45,836 --> 01:33:47,702
你不明白吗
Don't you understand?

1181
01:33:56,680 --> 01:33:59,464
我要跟您道歉  我以为
I owe you an apology. I thought

1182
01:33:59,808 --> 01:34:02,967
定期在夜间讨论有助于我们白天的工作
these quiet evening talks were useful to our work.

1183
01:34:03,270 --> 01:34:05,835
现在看来  对您是一种负担
But now I see that they're a burden to you.

1184
01:34:06,148 --> 01:34:08,713
我只是说今晚很累了
I was only saying I was tired tonight.

1185
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:10,308
不  您是对的
No, no. You're right.

1186
01:34:11,862 --> 01:34:14,646
我们的讨论在一整天之后是一种体力的负担
Our meetings are a burden after a long day.

1187
01:34:14,990 --> 01:34:18,108
我们最好还是取消了吧
Perhaps we'd better discontinue them.

1188
01:34:18,327 --> 01:34:20,777
讨论很有用  只是今天我太累了
They're useful. It was only tonight.

1189
01:34:21,038 --> 01:34:22,612
感谢您泡的热可可
I thank you for the cocoa.

1190
01:34:22,873 --> 01:34:26,282
以后我们在白天讨论吧
In the future, we shall communicate only during the day.

1191
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:28,785
如果可以的话  就用写字条的方式
If necessary, by written message.

1192
01:34:29,629 --> 01:34:31,663
祝您晚安
I wish you a very good night.

1193
01:34:36,053 --> 01:34:38,722
我明天要请个假
I shall be taking my day off tomorrow.

1194
01:34:40,098 --> 01:34:42,090
9点30分之前我会回来的
I'll be back in the house by 9:30.

1195
01:34:43,143 --> 01:34:44,165
可以
Certainly.

1196
01:34:44,770 --> 01:34:46,219
当然
Certainly.

1197
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:47,804
晚安
Good night.

1198
01:35:23,809 --> 01:35:26,207
我很高兴能够从庄园出来  我可以告诉你
I'm glad to be out of it, I can tell you.

1199
01:35:26,561 --> 01:35:30,054
杰弗瑞爵士和他的黑衫党
There was something about Sir Geoffrey and his Black Shirts

1200
01:35:30,607 --> 01:35:32,140
让我心惊胆战的
gave me the creeps.

1201
01:35:32,943 --> 01:35:35,268
史蒂文斯先生总说管理庄园
Mr. Stevens says we should run the house

1202
01:35:35,487 --> 01:35:38,188
要把自己的私人事务放在一边
and leave the rest where it belongs.

1203
01:35:40,033 --> 01:35:41,900
你不同意吧  贝恩先生
You don't agree, Mr. Benn.

1204
01:35:44,538 --> 01:35:45,904
我也是
Nor do I, really.

1205
01:35:47,082 --> 01:35:48,836
如果我要表示不喜欢
If I don't like something,

1206
01:35:48,837 --> 01:35:50,909
我就会说  够了  别说了
I want to say stuff it

1207
01:35:51,128 --> 01:35:53,912
请你原谅我的用词  肯顿小姐
if you'll pardon the expression, Miss Kenton.

1208
01:35:54,047 --> 01:35:58,500
看来我做管家不像史蒂文斯先生那么专业
But then I suppose I'm not a real professional, like Mr. Stevens.

1209
01:36:01,304 --> 01:36:03,421
史蒂文斯先生的一生都是管家
It's Mr. Stevens' whole life.

1210
01:36:04,641 --> 01:36:06,382
但我不一样
Well, it's not mine.

1211
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:08,635
告诉你件事情
And to tell you the truth

1212
01:36:08,812 --> 01:36:11,294
我不准备回去服侍雇主了
I don't want to go back in service.

1213
01:36:12,065 --> 01:36:15,923
-那你要做什么  贝恩先生  -叫我汤姆
-What would you do instead, Mr. Benn? -Tom's the name.

1214
01:36:18,322 --> 01:36:19,594
汤姆
Tom.

1215
01:36:21,158 --> 01:36:23,233
那你准备找份什么样的工作
What employment would you take up?

1216
01:36:23,827 --> 01:36:26,361
我准备自己开始做生意
I'd really like to be on my own.

1217
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:31,199
开家小店  卖报纸和香烟
Start a little shop somewhere, newspapers and tobacco.

1218
01:36:31,501 --> 01:36:35,703
或者去西南部的老家开家小旅店
Or a boarding house in the west country, where I come from.

1219
01:36:35,797 --> 01:36:38,706
克利夫顿很适合开小旅店  就在海边
Clevedon's a good place for a boarding house.

1220
01:36:38,884 --> 01:36:40,959
再喝一点吧
Would I get you another shandy?

1221
01:36:42,179 --> 01:36:44,421
已经9点30分了
Well, it's almost 9:30

1222
01:36:44,681 --> 01:36:46,172
拜托
Go on!

1223
01:36:46,391 --> 01:36:48,174
今天不是放假嘛
It's your day off, isn't it?

1224
01:36:48,268 --> 01:36:51,094
你又不是在军队  要踩时点回去
You're not in the army, due back in the barracks.

1225
01:36:51,396 --> 01:36:53,012
-好吧  再来一杯  -很好
-All right, then. -Good.

1226
01:36:55,567 --> 01:36:57,100
请再给我半杯
Half a shandy, please.

1227
01:37:12,918 --> 01:37:15,243
那你呢  莎拉
What about yourself, then, Sarah?

1228
01:37:15,379 --> 01:37:17,454
这个名字太一本正经
That's a serious sort of a name.

1229
01:37:17,631 --> 01:37:19,956
我母亲在世的时候  大家称呼我莎莉
They called me Sally when my mum was alive.

1230
01:37:20,258 --> 01:37:21,916
莎莉  很美
Sally. That's nice.

1231
01:37:26,765 --> 01:37:29,758
你想一辈子做女管家吗
Is it your intention to remain in service?

1232
01:37:29,976 --> 01:37:32,542
这是一个很好的职业  至少有份工作
It's a good profession, when you have a position.

1233
01:37:32,854 --> 01:37:35,216
史蒂文斯先生说我们很幸运
Mr. Stevens says we're fortunate

1234
01:37:35,217 --> 01:37:36,546
我们不是在谈论他
We're not talking about him.

1235
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:39,017
我们是在谈论你
We're talking about you.

1236
01:37:39,444 --> 01:37:41,227
假设
Supposing

1237
01:37:41,446 --> 01:37:46,441
有人邀请你去做海边的小旅馆的女主人
someone asked if you'd like to come in on a boarding house by the sea?

1238
01:37:46,660 --> 01:37:48,109
你怎么想
What would you say?

1239
01:37:49,788 --> 01:37:51,154
我不知道
Well, I don't know.

1240
01:37:51,415 --> 01:37:55,106
这是个假想的问题  所以我不会去想
It's a theoretical question, so I haven't given it any thought

1241
01:37:55,460 --> 01:37:57,410
-贝恩先生  -叫我汤姆
-  Mr. Benn. -Tom.

1242
01:37:58,130 --> 01:38:01,498
如果这不是个假想的问题
Supposing it wasn't theoretical

1243
01:38:02,509 --> 01:38:03,416
莎莉
Sally?

1244
01:38:05,721 --> 01:38:08,880
已经很久没人叫我这个名字了  感觉很滑稽
It's been years since I've been called that. It feels funny.

1245
01:38:09,141 --> 01:38:10,548
但感觉很好吧
Nice, though?

1246
01:38:38,211 --> 01:38:39,661
很晚了
It's very late.

1247
01:39:24,591 --> 01:39:26,332
还有别的事吗  老爷
Will there be anything else?

1248
01:39:26,677 --> 01:39:27,698
什么
What?

1249
01:39:32,432 --> 01:39:35,717
-谢谢  晚安  -晚安  老爷
-Thank you. Good night. -Good night, my lord.

1250
01:39:51,076 --> 01:39:52,400
卡迪纳尔先生  晚上好
Mr. Cardinal, good evening.

1251
01:39:52,744 --> 01:39:54,277
-你好吗  -很好
-How are you? -Very well.

1252
01:39:54,579 --> 01:39:57,572
-很好  那你妻子呢  -也很好  先生
-Delighted. And your wife? -Very well too, sir.

1253
01:39:59,001 --> 01:40:00,700
-你好吗  -很好  先生
-How are you? -Very well, sir.

1254
01:40:00,961 --> 01:40:04,537
今天我的安排计划有点混乱
I've gone and got myself in a bit of a mess with arrangements.

1255
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:06,623
公爵能让我在这里待一晚吗
Would His Lordship put me up?

1256
01:40:06,925 --> 01:40:08,792
我会告诉他您来了
I'll tell him you're here.

1257
01:40:09,511 --> 01:40:11,377
但愿今天没有什么特殊的事情
I hope there's nothing special tonight.

1258
01:40:11,596 --> 01:40:14,162
老爷在晚饭后有几个客人要见
His Lordship expects some gentlemen after dinner.

1259
01:40:14,433 --> 01:40:18,468
那我尽量低调  反正我也要专心写我的专栏
I'll keep my head down, then. I've got to write my column anyway.

1260
01:40:18,812 --> 01:40:22,013
-您正好赶上晚餐时间  -但愿不麻烦你
-You're in time for dinner, if you like. -I hoped I would be.

1261
01:40:22,316 --> 01:40:24,265
我的教父他怎么样  身体好吗
How is my godfather? Fit?

1262
01:40:24,568 --> 01:40:26,601
很好  您要点心吗
Very well. Some refreshment?

1263
01:40:26,903 --> 01:40:29,302
谢谢  再来点威士忌就更好了
Thank you. Some whisky would be lovely.

1264
01:40:29,531 --> 01:40:33,472
-他今晚要见谁   -我也没法回答您
-Who's he expecting tonight? -I am unable to help you there.

1265
01:40:33,577 --> 01:40:34,599
什么  你也不知道
What, no idea?

1266
01:40:34,870 --> 01:40:36,736
一点也不知道  先生
No idea at all, sir.

1267
01:40:38,123 --> 01:40:42,325
-那我会很低调的  -你做的对  先生
-I'll keep my head down all the same. -I think it's a good idea, sir.

1268
01:40:45,005 --> 01:40:46,110
请进
Come in.

1269
01:40:50,677 --> 01:40:53,878
卡迪纳尔先生刚到  让人出乎意料
Mr. Cardinal has just arrived, out of the blue.

1270
01:40:54,222 --> 01:40:56,172
给他准备一下他的房间
He'll expect his usual room.

1271
01:40:57,392 --> 01:41:00,301
-我出门前会去确认的  -你要出去
-I'll see to it before I leave. -You're going out?

1272
01:41:00,562 --> 01:41:01,584
是的
I am indeed.

1273
01:41:01,688 --> 01:41:02,679
今天是星期四
It's Thursday.

1274
01:41:03,106 --> 01:41:05,473
哦  我忘记了  抱歉
Of course. I'd forgotten. Sorry.

1275
01:41:05,776 --> 01:41:07,225
有什么事情
Is something the matter?

1276
01:41:10,030 --> 01:41:13,148
有些客人要来  但跟您没什么关系
Some visitors are arriving, but it doesn't involve you.

1277
01:41:13,575 --> 01:41:16,568
虽然每周四我都可以放假
We agreed that Thursday is my day off

1278
01:41:16,912 --> 01:41:19,310
但如果你急需我帮忙
but if you need me urgently-

1279
01:41:19,414 --> 01:41:21,896
不用  今晚没什么事  谢谢
No, it's perfectly all right. Thank you.

1280
01:41:26,088 --> 01:41:27,996
我有事要告诉你
I have something to tell you.

1281
01:41:30,550 --> 01:41:31,541
我的朋友
My friend

1282
01:41:33,345 --> 01:41:35,712
就是我去见的人  贝恩先生
the man I'm meeting, Mr. Benn.

1283
01:41:36,223 --> 01:41:38,256
贝恩先生  我知道
Mr. Benn. Of course. Yes.

1284
01:41:42,813 --> 01:41:45,346
他向我求婚了
He has asked me to marry him.

1285
01:41:49,528 --> 01:41:51,102
我还在考虑
I am thinking about it.

1286
01:41:51,697 --> 01:41:53,062
我明白了
I see.

1287
01:41:54,825 --> 01:41:57,306
他下个月要回到西南部去
He's moving to the west country next month.

1288
01:42:04,918 --> 01:42:07,118
我也还在考虑
I'm still thinking about it.

1289
01:42:08,380 --> 01:42:11,456
我想事先通知您一下
I thought you should be informed of the situation.

1290
01:42:15,303 --> 01:42:16,628
好的  谢谢
Yes, thank you.

1291
01:42:17,681 --> 01:42:18,922
您真是太好心了
That's most kind of you.

1292
01:42:25,063 --> 01:42:28,181
祝您今晚过的愉快
I trust you'll have a most pleasant evening.

1293
01:42:42,414 --> 01:42:44,531
今晚什么有什么特别的事吗
Is there something special tonight?

1294
01:42:45,959 --> 01:42:47,700
您的访客  他们很特殊吗
Are your visitors special?

1295
01:42:49,296 --> 01:42:52,288
不能告诉你  我的孩子  绝对保密
Can't tell you, my boy. Strictly confidential.

1296
01:42:52,883 --> 01:42:55,750
-所以我不能在场了咯   -在哪
-So I can't sit in on it? -On what?

1297
01:42:56,303 --> 01:42:59,671
-你们会见的地方  -绝对不行
-Whatever it is that's taking place. -Absolutely not.

1298
01:43:00,557 --> 01:43:04,092
像你这样的新闻记者不能插足这件事
Can't have someone like you sticking your nose in. A journalist.

1299
01:43:04,394 --> 01:43:06,678
你们怎么称来着  "狗仔队"
What do you call it, a " newshound"?

1300
01:43:07,230 --> 01:43:08,888
绝对不行
No, it wouldn't do at all.

1301
01:43:09,775 --> 01:43:13,017
吃好晚餐  你就别出来了
Once you've had your food, you'd better make yourself scarce.

1302
01:43:14,571 --> 01:43:16,855
看来很神秘的样子
It sounds pretty special to me.

1303
01:43:47,104 --> 01:43:49,053
晚上好  首相
Good evening, prime minister.

1304
01:43:49,398 --> 01:43:51,556
-抱歉  我们被耽搁了  -我能理解
-Sorry, we've been delayed. -I understand.

1305
01:43:51,650 --> 01:43:52,974
哈菲克斯公爵
Lord Halifax.

1306
01:43:53,986 --> 01:43:56,811
-很高兴见到您  -这是弗雷泽先生
-Very nice to see you. -This is Mr. Fraser.

1307
01:44:08,959 --> 01:44:10,700
晚上好  阁下
Good evening, Your Excellency.

1308
01:44:16,633 --> 01:44:20,491
请稍等  阁下  我去告知公爵
Please wait here, Your Excellency. I'll inform His Lordship.

1309
01:45:11,313 --> 01:45:15,004
我们不想把大英帝国卷入战争
We don't intend to involve the whole British Empire in a war

1310
01:45:15,317 --> 01:45:19,144
仅仅因为在远方的一个小国家发生的争端
simply because of a quarrel in a faraway country

1311
01:45:19,237 --> 01:45:22,897
那里的人我们还完全不了解
between people of whom we know nothing.

1312
01:45:23,367 --> 01:45:25,932
对我来说  整个捷克斯洛伐克民族
To my mind, the whole of Czechoslovakia

1313
01:45:26,244 --> 01:45:28,778
还不如我们国家的任何一个年轻人
isn't worth a single one of our own young men.

1314
01:45:29,039 --> 01:45:31,708
我们这里一群小国家吵嚷着要战争
We have a small, noisy and corrupt war group here

1315
01:45:31,875 --> 01:45:36,911
却没有意识到你们德国只是在清理自己的后院
who don't realize that you Germans are marching into your own back yard.

1316
01:45:38,965 --> 01:45:43,001
元首打心底里是一个和平主义者
The Fhrer is a man of peace to the depth of his soul

1317
01:45:43,929 --> 01:45:47,005
但他绝不允许一个二流国家
but he won't allow a small second-rate country

1318
01:45:47,307 --> 01:45:51,165
在德意志帝国1000年的历史中指着自己的鼻子
to thumb its nose at the 1000-year German Reich.

1319
01:46:06,410 --> 01:46:07,400
我去吧
I'll get it.

1320
01:46:09,121 --> 01:46:10,278
快醒醒
Come on, wake up!

1321
01:46:11,331 --> 01:46:12,322
保持清醒
Stay awake!

1322
01:46:20,215 --> 01:46:23,625
您能认出这位小姐是这儿的职员吗
Could you confirm that this lady is on the staff here?

1323
01:46:23,844 --> 01:46:26,920
是的  她是这儿的女管家
Yes, of course. She's the housekeeper.

1324
01:46:27,014 --> 01:46:28,254
谢谢  先生
Thank you, sir.

1325
01:46:29,474 --> 01:46:30,340
-我可以走了吗  -当然  小姐
-May I? -Of course.

1326
01:46:30,642 --> 01:46:32,133
抱歉把您当坏人了
Sorry to have alarmed you.

1327
01:46:32,227 --> 01:46:34,344
只是以防万一
Just security, miss.

1328
01:46:39,484 --> 01:46:41,851
我相信您肯定过了一个很愉快的夜晚
I trust you've had a pleasant evening.

1329
01:46:45,157 --> 01:46:47,826
您过得愉快吗
Well, did you have a pleasant evening?

1330
01:46:48,118 --> 01:46:49,818
-是的  谢谢  -很好
-Yes, thank you. -Good.

1331
01:46:49,911 --> 01:46:52,987
你不想知道发生什么事吗
Would you like to know what took place?

1332
01:46:54,082 --> 01:46:56,157
我必须上楼去了
I have to return upstairs.

1333
01:46:56,376 --> 01:46:59,619
今晚有重要的事情
There are important events taking place tonight.

1334
01:47:01,798 --> 01:47:03,331
什么时候不是呢
When are there not?

1335
01:47:06,887 --> 01:47:09,368
我接受了
I accepted his proposal.

1336
01:47:10,682 --> 01:47:13,133
我接受了贝恩先生的求婚
I accepted Mr. Benn's proposal of marriage.

1337
01:47:14,102 --> 01:47:15,176
恭喜您
My congratulations.

1338
01:47:15,479 --> 01:47:17,470
我准备交出辞职信了
I am prepared to serve out my notice.

1339
01:47:17,814 --> 01:47:21,182
如果您能早点放我走  我将感激不尽
But if you'd release me earlier, I'd be grateful.

1340
01:47:21,485 --> 01:47:25,343
贝恩先生打算半个月内就动身
Mr. Benn is planning to leave for the west country in two weeks.

1341
01:47:25,781 --> 01:47:27,355
我尽力
I'll do my best.

1342
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:29,774
请恕我失陪
Now, please excuse me.

1343
01:47:36,833 --> 01:47:41,453
我在这儿工作了这么多年  你没什么要说吗
After all the years I have been here, you have nothing else to say?

1344
01:47:43,382 --> 01:47:46,416
我向您献上最诚挚的祝福
You have my warmest congratulations.

1345
01:47:49,638 --> 01:47:52,464
您是一个非常重要的人
You've been a very important figure

1346
01:47:52,671 --> 01:47:53,371
对于我和贝恩先生
for Mr. Benn and me.

1347
01:47:55,519 --> 01:47:57,093
怎么重要
Oh, in what way?

1348
01:47:57,688 --> 01:48:00,722
我告诉他所有您的细节
I tell him all sorts of things about you.

1349
01:48:01,066 --> 01:48:04,350
我告诉他您的故事  您的习惯
I tell him stories about you. About your habits.

1350
01:48:05,487 --> 01:48:07,145
关于您的言谈举止
About your mannerisms.

1351
01:48:07,489 --> 01:48:10,648
他觉得十分有趣  特别是您
He finds it very funny, especially when I show him how

1352
01:48:10,993 --> 01:48:14,069
往食物上洒胡椒粉的时候会捏住鼻子
you pinch your nose when you put pepper on your food.

1353
01:48:14,371 --> 01:48:16,821
这总让我们忍不住大笑
That always has us in stitches.

1354
01:48:22,421 --> 01:48:24,079
是吗
Does it, indeed?

1355
01:48:29,011 --> 01:48:30,460
那么  请
Well, please

1356
01:48:31,013 --> 01:48:32,962
允许我失陪  肯顿小姐
excuse me, Miss Kenton.

1357
01:48:34,182 --> 01:48:35,173
晚安
Good night.

1358
01:48:58,874 --> 01:48:59,948
谢谢
Thanks.

1359
01:49:04,338 --> 01:49:06,496
我们做了很长时间的朋友  是吧
We've been friends a long time, haven't we?

1360
01:49:07,841 --> 01:49:10,834
我每次来这儿  总是期待跟你谈话
I always look forward to a chat when I come here.

1361
01:49:11,219 --> 01:49:13,701
你可以跟我坐下来一起喝一杯吗
Would you care to join me in a drink?

1362
01:49:13,972 --> 01:49:16,131
您真好  但是不了  谢谢
That's most kind of you, but no, thank you.

1363
01:49:16,433 --> 01:49:17,799
你没事吧
You all right?

1364
01:49:17,976 --> 01:49:19,248
我非常好
I'm perfectly all right.

1365
01:49:19,561 --> 01:49:21,636
没有觉得不舒服吗
Not feeling unwell, are you?

1366
01:49:23,065 --> 01:49:24,253
只是有点累
A little tired, perhaps.

1367
01:49:24,524 --> 01:49:27,350
肯定的  现在都  凌晨1点了
I bet you're tired. What is it, about 1:00?

1368
01:49:27,611 --> 01:49:28,799
过来
Come on.

1369
01:49:29,446 --> 01:49:30,718
我要你坐下
I want you to sit down.

1370
01:49:31,198 --> 01:49:32,564
先生  我真的
Well, sir, I really-

1371
01:49:40,332 --> 01:49:42,031
我不是碰巧才来这儿的
I didn't come here by accident.

1372
01:49:42,376 --> 01:49:43,564
你知道吧
You know that.

1373
01:49:44,836 --> 01:49:46,411
我有条线报  关于
I had a tip-off, you see

1374
01:49:46,672 --> 01:49:50,039
现在正在书房里的客人
about what's going on now in the library.

1375
01:49:52,386 --> 01:49:54,711
我希望你坐下  我是你的朋友
I wish you'd sit down. I'm your friend

1376
01:49:55,013 --> 01:49:58,704
你总端着盘子  好像随时就要走似的
and you're holding that tray as if you're about to wander off!

1377
01:49:59,059 --> 01:50:01,009
过来  坐下
Now, come on. Sit down, damn it!

1378
01:50:04,147 --> 01:50:05,336
好多了
That's better.

1379
01:50:06,984 --> 01:50:11,519
听着  我猜首相不在书房里吧
Now, look, I don't suppose the prime minister is in the library, is he?

1380
01:50:12,155 --> 01:50:13,427
首相  先生
Prime minister, sir?

1381
01:50:14,700 --> 01:50:17,067
在书房  你不用做什么确认
In the library-You don't have to confirm it-

1382
01:50:17,327 --> 01:50:21,571
我们的首相  外交大臣  德国大使
-are our prime minister, our foreign secretary and the German ambassador.

1383
01:50:22,624 --> 01:50:25,742
-你猜他们在谈些什么  -我不知道
-Any idea what they're talking about? -I'm afraid not.

1384
01:50:26,003 --> 01:50:28,787
告诉我  史蒂文斯  你一点也不关心吗
Tell me, Stevens, don't you care at all?

1385
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:31,039
你一点也不感到好奇吗
Aren't you in the least bit curious?

1386
01:50:31,508 --> 01:50:34,334
我无权对这些事情感兴趣
It's not my place to be curious about such matters.

1387
01:50:34,636 --> 01:50:36,169
你无权
Not your place.

1388
01:50:36,888 --> 01:50:39,255
假设我告诉你  公爵
And supposing I told you that His Lordship

1389
01:50:39,349 --> 01:50:41,674
正在试图说服首相
is trying to persuade the prime minister

1390
01:50:41,935 --> 01:50:45,553
跟柏林那些战争犯达成协议
to enter into a pact with that bunch of criminals in Berlin?

1391
01:50:45,772 --> 01:50:49,714
我深信老爷肯定有他最高尚的出发点
I'm certain His Lordship is acting from the highest and noblest motives.

1392
01:50:49,985 --> 01:50:53,561
你不明白吗  就是这一点让人感到讨厌
Don't you see? That's exactly what makes it so abominable!

1393
01:50:53,822 --> 01:50:57,982
把这些崇高的好意扭曲成了糟糕的结局
Twisting these high and noble motives to their own foul ends!

1394
01:50:58,076 --> 01:51:01,653
请你务必要意识到  公爵正在成为
You do, please, realize that His Lordship's been the most

1395
01:51:01,955 --> 01:51:05,365
纳粹在我们国家最有价值的棋子
valuable pawn that the Nazis have in this country

1396
01:51:05,625 --> 01:51:08,493
只是因为他把别人想的太好了
precisely because he is good and honourable?

1397
01:51:09,171 --> 01:51:12,080
要我没有喝太多酒  就能让你明白了
If I weren't so drunk, I could make you understand!

1398
01:51:13,175 --> 01:51:14,082
先生
Sir

1399
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:16,376
我明白的
I do understand.

1400
01:51:17,512 --> 01:51:20,463
老爷正在努力维持我们时代的和平
His Lordship is working to ensure peace in our time.

1401
01:51:20,766 --> 01:51:23,800
建立在他们猛兽般的条款上的和平
Peace in our time on their beastly terms!

1402
01:51:24,102 --> 01:51:26,667
记得那次会议上的美国人吗
Remember that American here at the conference?

1403
01:51:26,938 --> 01:51:29,931
把达林顿公爵称为业余者
Called Lord Darlington an amateur, out of his depth?

1404
01:51:30,275 --> 01:51:31,433
他倒是说对了
Well, he was right.

1405
01:51:31,610 --> 01:51:33,143
他说的太对了
He was dead right.

1406
01:51:33,779 --> 01:51:37,605
我真不知道该怎么跟你谈论公爵
I hardly have to tell you how I feel towards His Lordship.

1407
01:51:37,699 --> 01:51:41,276
我跟你一样都非常地关心他
I care about him deeply, and I know you do too.

1408
01:51:41,536 --> 01:51:42,642
是的
Yes, I do indeed.

1409
01:51:42,913 --> 01:51:46,448
那你怎能忍心看他犯下如此严重的错误
Then aren't you desperate to see him make this mistake?

1410
01:51:46,958 --> 01:51:49,585
他被玩弄了  你不明白吗
He's being tricked! Don't you see?

1411
01:51:49,586 --> 01:51:52,026
还是你跟他一样被蒙蔽了双眼
Or are you as deluded as he is?

1412
01:51:53,548 --> 01:51:55,707
天哪  我可能真的冒犯到你了
Oh, dear. Now I've probably offended you.

1413
01:51:56,468 --> 01:51:57,959
没关系  先生
No. Not at all, sir.

1414
01:51:59,221 --> 01:52:00,409
没关系
Not at all.

1415
01:52:06,019 --> 01:52:07,343
请原谅我失陪
You must excuse me.

1416
01:52:08,397 --> 01:52:12,015
还有其他客人需要我
There are other gentlemen calling for me, sir.

1417
01:52:42,097 --> 01:52:46,216
请不要在意我说的话
You mustn't take anything I said to heart.

1418
01:52:47,602 --> 01:52:50,512
我刚才太失礼了
I was very foolish a little while ago.

1419
01:52:54,860 --> 01:52:57,102
我没有太当真
I haven't taken anything you said to heart.

1420
01:52:57,362 --> 01:53:01,898
实际上  我都不记得了
In fact, I can hardly recall anything you did say.

1421
01:53:02,159 --> 01:53:04,192
我只是太傻了
I was just being very foolish.

1422
01:53:04,953 --> 01:53:09,739
我实在没有时间跟您站在这儿闲谈
I simply haven't time to stand here with you, engaging in idle talk.

1423
01:53:11,585 --> 01:53:14,619
建议您上床睡觉  您一定很累了
I suggest you go to bed now. You must be very tired.

1424
01:53:14,713 --> 01:53:16,162
晚安
Good night.

1425
01:55:14,791 --> 01:55:17,117
我想告诉您
I'd been wanting to tell you

1426
01:55:18,253 --> 01:55:22,080
早餐室外面有个角落
It's the small alcove outside the breakfast room.

1427
01:55:22,966 --> 01:55:24,999
可能是新来的女仆不熟悉
It's the new girl, of course

1428
01:55:26,094 --> 01:55:29,712
我看到好几次都有积灰尘
but I find it has not been dusted in some time.

1429
01:55:33,352 --> 01:55:35,677
我会去看看的
I'll see to it.

1430
01:55:36,438 --> 01:55:37,512
谢谢
Thank you.

1431
01:55:38,273 --> 01:55:40,974
我知道您会想要知道的
I knew you would have wanted to be informed.

1432
01:57:29,509 --> 01:57:30,583
你好  莎莉
Hello, Sally.

1433
01:57:30,844 --> 01:57:31,949
嗨  汤姆
Hi, Tom.

1434
01:57:33,013 --> 01:57:34,285
你没事吧
You all right, then?

1435
01:57:34,723 --> 01:57:36,047
你呢
How are you?

1436
01:57:36,308 --> 01:57:37,413
我很好
I'm good.

1437
01:57:40,812 --> 01:57:43,930
我们可以稍谈一会吗  就一会
Could we talk for a moment, please? Just for a moment.

1438
01:57:44,232 --> 01:57:46,599
最好快点  我正好要出去
We'll have to be quick because I'm going out.

1439
01:57:46,818 --> 01:57:48,309
不会很久的
It won't take long.

1440
01:57:49,696 --> 01:57:52,230
好吧  我们去客厅谈
All right, then. We'll have to go into the lounge.

1441
01:57:57,746 --> 01:57:58,768
下午好
Afternoon.

1442
01:58:04,711 --> 01:58:06,661
舒适的小房间  不错
Nice little place, isn't it?

1443
01:58:07,547 --> 01:58:11,291
有点像我们想象中的小旅馆
The sort of quiet little boarding house I had in mind for us.

1444
01:58:13,345 --> 01:58:16,755
像其他事情一样  也没能做成
Like other things, it didn't work out.

1445
01:58:17,057 --> 01:58:19,090
你有什么事要说
What did you want to say?

1446
01:58:21,144 --> 01:58:24,919
我昨天见到凯瑟琳  她有些好消息
I saw Catherine yesterday. She had some interesting news.

1447
01:58:26,984 --> 01:58:28,057
她怀孕了
She's expecting.

1448
01:58:28,402 --> 01:58:29,309
哦  天哪
Oh, my goodness!

1449
01:58:34,783 --> 01:58:37,567
她想让我们礼拜天去喝杯茶
She wants us both over for tea on Sunday.

1450
01:58:39,913 --> 01:58:41,738
我可以来接你
I could come and get you.

1451
01:58:43,125 --> 01:58:45,200
我们可以一起坐巴士去
We could go together on the bus.

1452
01:58:46,253 --> 01:58:48,328
我再考虑一下
Yes, well, we'll see about that.

1453
01:58:51,466 --> 01:58:53,541
没有了你  房子都是空荡荡的
House is that empty without you.

1454
01:58:56,096 --> 01:58:57,545
我没法告诉你
I can't tell you.

1455
01:59:01,309 --> 01:59:02,926
你又在刮胡须的时候划伤了
You cut yourself shaving.

1456
01:59:03,478 --> 01:59:04,969
我知道
Oh, yeah. I know.

1457
01:59:05,522 --> 01:59:07,680
这些天  做什么都不对劲
Can't seem to do anything right these days.

1458
01:59:17,034 --> 01:59:19,859
史蒂文斯  我经常想起那些美好时光
I so often think of the good old days

1459
01:59:20,162 --> 01:59:22,727
那时我曾是达林顿府女管家
when I was housekeeper at Darlington Hall.

1460
01:59:22,789 --> 01:59:26,074
那些年是我一生中最快乐的时光
Those years with you were the happiest of my life.

1461
01:59:26,376 --> 01:59:27,951
您还要再来点茶吗
Would you like more tea?

1462
01:59:28,962 --> 01:59:30,370
是的  谢谢
Yes, please. Thank you.

1463
01:59:31,089 --> 01:59:33,164
肯顿小姐  抱歉  贝恩夫人
Miss Kenton. I'm sorry, Mrs. Benn.

1464
01:59:33,342 --> 01:59:36,251
-抱歉  我来晚了  -没关系
-Sorry, I was delayed. -That's all right.

1465
01:59:36,345 --> 01:59:37,335
请坐
Please sit down.

1466
01:59:40,474 --> 01:59:43,039
-我点了一壶茶  -很好
-I've ordered some fresh tea. -Lovely.

1467
01:59:43,310 --> 01:59:45,218
您要来点蛋糕吗
Would you like some cake?

1468
01:59:45,562 --> 01:59:48,231
-真的不要   -最近发胖了
-Sure? -All right. It's a special occasion.

1469
01:59:48,482 --> 01:59:49,264
好吧
Good.

1470
01:59:50,025 --> 01:59:51,015
服务生
Waitress?

1471
01:59:52,235 --> 01:59:55,061
-请给我来一份蛋糕  -好的
-Could we have some cake? -Yes, of course.

1472
01:59:58,075 --> 01:59:59,816
-多年不见啊  -是啊
-It's been a long time. -Yes, indeed.

1473
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:01,776
您一点也没变
You haven't changed at all.

1474
02:00:03,830 --> 02:00:05,488
也许  一点点
A little, perhaps.

1475
02:00:05,540 --> 02:00:07,323
我们都有变化
We've all changed, I think.

1476
02:00:07,584 --> 02:00:09,451
无论到哪我都会认得你
I'd have known you anywhere.

1477
02:00:14,883 --> 02:00:16,958
多久了没见了  20年了吧
How long's it been? Twenty years?

1478
02:00:17,260 --> 02:00:18,835
我想正好刚过20年
Yes, just over, I think.

1479
02:00:19,554 --> 02:00:21,379
茶怎么还没来
The tea should be along.

1480
02:00:44,079 --> 02:00:46,154
我们从报纸上看到了诽谤案
We read about the suit for libel.

1481
02:00:46,331 --> 02:00:48,073
这是个耻辱
It's a shame

1482
02:00:48,709 --> 02:00:50,955
竟然称达林顿公爵为叛国者
calling His Lordship a traitor.

1483
02:00:50,956 --> 02:00:52,400
报纸真是什么都敢写
Those papers will print anything.

1484
02:00:52,713 --> 02:00:54,788
他们不该赢这个案子的
They should have lost the case.

1485
02:00:56,258 --> 02:00:58,374
当老爷走上法庭的时候
When His Lordship went to court

1486
02:00:58,677 --> 02:01:01,795
他真诚地希望自己能得到公正
he sincerely expected he would get justice.

1487
02:01:03,265 --> 02:01:06,424
然而  报社还变本加厉
Instead, the newspaper increased its circulation, and His Lordship's

1488
02:01:06,727 --> 02:01:09,052
老爷的好名声全给毁了
good name was destroyed forever.

1489
02:01:11,189 --> 02:01:13,473
之后  在他生命的最后几年
Afterwards, in his last years, well

1490
02:01:14,318 --> 02:01:16,392
老实说  贝恩夫人
quite honestly, Mrs. Benn

1491
02:01:17,446 --> 02:01:18,467
他已经心碎了
his heart was broken.

1492
02:01:19,489 --> 02:01:24,150
我送茶到书房  而他只是坐在那里
I'd take him tea in the library, and he'd be sitting there

1493
02:01:24,453 --> 02:01:27,862
他看也不看我  沉浸在他自己的世界里
and he wouldn't even see me, so deep was he in his own thoughts.

1494
02:01:30,709 --> 02:01:34,828
他还会自言自语  就像在跟别人争论什么似的
And he'd be talking to himself, as though he was arguing with someone.

1495
02:01:35,172 --> 02:01:37,247
当然  只有他一个人
There was no one, of course.

1496
02:01:37,966 --> 02:01:39,707
不再有人来看他了
No one came to see him anymore.

1497
02:01:40,927 --> 02:01:44,785
那他的教子  卡迪纳尔先生呢
What about his godson, young Mr. Cardinal?

1498
02:01:45,057 --> 02:01:47,590
卡迪纳尔先生在战争中牺牲了
Mr. Cardinal was killed in the war. Waitress.

1499
02:01:47,684 --> 02:01:49,551
我要结帐
May I have my bill, please?

1500
02:01:51,897 --> 02:01:53,346
我很抱歉听到这个消息
I'm very sorry.

1501
02:02:02,991 --> 02:02:06,443
我知道您脑海中的达林顿府是它最繁盛的时期
I know you remember Darlington Hall in its best days

1502
02:02:06,745 --> 02:02:11,072
老爷也希望这样被铭记
and that's how His Lordship deserves to be remembered.

1503
02:02:11,333 --> 02:02:14,784
可能这些好时光会再来  因为刘易斯先生来了
But perhaps the good days are back, now that Mr. Lewis is here

1504
02:02:14,878 --> 02:02:16,953
刘易斯太太也将到来
and Mrs. Lewis is arriving shortly.

1505
02:02:17,297 --> 02:02:20,081
他们很幸运  能有你管理房子
Very fortunate to have you running the house.

1506
02:02:20,425 --> 02:02:25,128
我们还是有点问题  肯顿小姐  抱歉  贝恩夫人
We still have problems, Miss Kenton. I'm sorry. Mrs. Benn.

1507
02:02:25,222 --> 02:02:29,632
-我们还是有点人手问题  -你在信里有提到
-We still have staff problems. -You mentioned it in your letter.

1508
02:02:31,478 --> 02:02:35,419
老实说  我也在想回去做女管家
Frankly, I've been thinking of going back in service.

1509
02:02:35,691 --> 02:02:36,879
很好
Good-

1510
02:02:37,734 --> 02:02:40,810
但是现在情形变了
But now the situation has changed for me.

1511
02:02:40,904 --> 02:02:43,646
如果我要找份工作  我将
If I take up any work, it will have to be

1512
02:02:43,907 --> 02:02:46,066
找一份在这儿的工作
here in the west country

1513
02:02:46,576 --> 02:02:50,737
因为凯瑟琳  我女儿怀孕了
because Catherine, our daughter, is expecting a baby.

1514
02:02:52,749 --> 02:02:54,699
我想待在她身边
So I would like to be near her.

1515
02:02:55,002 --> 02:02:56,107
当然
Of course.

1516
02:02:57,212 --> 02:03:00,121
然后待在孙子的身边  陪他长大
And to be near our grandchild as he grows up.

1517
02:03:00,424 --> 02:03:04,876
-这是自然的  -或者孙女  如果是个女孩的话
-Naturally. -Or her, if it's a little girl.

1518
02:03:13,061 --> 02:03:15,731
多年前我离开达林顿府的时候
When I left Darlington Hall, all those years ago

1519
02:03:15,981 --> 02:03:19,265
我并没有意识到是真的离开了
I never realized I was really, truly leaving.

1520
02:03:20,360 --> 02:03:23,895
我总想着离开那儿是为了
I believe I thought of it as simply another ruse

1521
02:03:24,156 --> 02:03:25,647
让你烦恼
to annoy you.

1522
02:03:27,784 --> 02:03:31,236
突然意识到自己已婚  让我很是惊讶
It was a shock to come out here and find myself actually married.

1523
02:03:31,580 --> 02:03:33,613
很长一段时间  我都
For a long time, I was

1524
02:03:33,957 --> 02:03:35,490
很不幸福
very unhappy.

1525
02:03:36,918 --> 02:03:40,286
后来凯瑟琳出生了  一年一年过去
But then Catherine was born, the years went by and one day

1526
02:03:40,505 --> 02:03:42,872
然后意识到我爱我的丈夫
I realized I loved my husband.

1527
02:03:43,925 --> 02:03:46,543
知道吗  这世界上
You see, there is no one

1528
02:03:47,304 --> 02:03:51,423
没有人会像他那般地需要我
no one in the world who needs me as much as he does.

1529
02:03:53,310 --> 02:03:55,260
但时不时地
But still there are times

1530
02:03:56,730 --> 02:04:00,890
我也会觉得曾犯了一个天大的错误
when I think I made a terrible mistake with my life.

1531
02:04:03,779 --> 02:04:06,563
我想我们都会有这样的想法
I'm sure we all have these thoughts

1532
02:04:06,823 --> 02:04:08,273
时不时地
from time to time.

1533
02:04:43,902 --> 02:04:48,229
人们总是在夜晚亮灯时欢呼
People always cheer when they turn the lights on in the evening.

1534
02:04:48,490 --> 02:04:49,679
我想知道为什么
I wonder why.

1535
02:04:51,243 --> 02:04:52,609
人们常说
They do say

1536
02:04:53,453 --> 02:04:57,447
对许多人来说  夜晚是一天中最好的时光
that for many people, the evening's the best part of the day.

1537
02:04:57,958 --> 02:05:00,356
是他们最期待的时刻
The part they most look forward to.

1538
02:05:00,794 --> 02:05:02,660
是吗
Is that so?

1539
02:05:04,131 --> 02:05:07,373
您最期待的是什么  史蒂文斯
What do you most look forward to?

1540
02:05:11,972 --> 02:05:14,339
首要的是  回到达林顿府
Getting back to Darlington Hall, principally

1541
02:05:14,641 --> 02:05:17,258
把人手问题解决掉
and straightening out our staff problems.

1542
02:05:17,477 --> 02:05:20,095
您对这些事总是很在行
You were always able to do that.

1543
02:05:20,939 --> 02:05:24,224
我想您肯定有很多事情要处理
And you had quite a few to straighten out, as I remember.

1544
02:05:27,904 --> 02:05:30,814
总是在工作  工作  更多的工作
Always was work, work and more work

1545
02:05:31,325 --> 02:05:34,234
然后依旧会如此  毫无疑问
and will continue to be so, I have no doubt.

1546
02:05:47,507 --> 02:05:51,418
史蒂文斯  不用等在那里  这班巴士总是晚点
Mr. Stevens, don't you wait! That bus is always late.

1547
02:05:51,678 --> 02:05:53,461
过来躲躲雨吧
Come in out of the wet.

1548
02:06:01,355 --> 02:06:03,346
你要好好照顾自己
You must take good care of yourself.

1549
02:06:04,191 --> 02:06:08,268
-你也是  向我保证  -是的  向你保证
-You too, promise me that. -Oh, yes, I promise.

1550
02:06:08,403 --> 02:06:13,314
尽可能地让你和你丈夫幸福吧
Do all you can to make these years happy for yourself and your husband.

1551
02:06:14,034 --> 02:06:16,109
我们可能再也见不到面了  贝恩夫人
We may never meet again, Mrs. Benn.

1552
02:06:16,411 --> 02:06:19,863
所以我以个人名义说  请原谅我
That is why I am being personal, if you will forgive me.

1553
02:06:21,667 --> 02:06:23,658
谢谢  史蒂文斯
Thank you, Mr. Stevens.

1554
02:06:24,002 --> 02:06:26,619
车来了  偏偏今天准点了
Oh, here it comes. It's on time for once.

1555
02:06:48,652 --> 02:06:51,603
谢谢  谢谢你能来
Thank you. And thank you so very much for coming.

1556
02:06:51,905 --> 02:06:53,688
你真是太好了
It was so very kind of you.

1557
02:06:53,991 --> 02:06:55,315
非常高兴能再见到你
It was so nice to see you.

1558
02:06:55,784 --> 02:06:58,860
我也很高兴能再见到你  再见
It was a pleasure to see you again. Goodbye.

1559
02:06:59,496 --> 02:07:00,487
当心
Take care.

1560
02:07:48,920 --> 02:07:51,246
你吓到我了  你从哪儿蹦出来的
You scared me. Where'd you come from?

1561
02:07:52,674 --> 02:07:53,779
你喜欢这件吗
You like the suit?

1562
02:07:54,092 --> 02:07:55,281
很好  先生
Very good, sir.

1563
02:08:03,518 --> 02:08:04,300
很好
Good.

1564
02:08:08,732 --> 02:08:10,348
当心上面的吊灯
Watch the chandelier there.

1565
02:08:21,828 --> 02:08:25,405
你真是安排的井井有条  太好了
You're really getting things going here. This is wonderful!

1566
02:08:27,084 --> 02:08:31,202
我不得不叫上镇上的三个姑娘来帮忙
I've had to ask another three girls from the village to come up.

1567
02:08:31,505 --> 02:08:35,081
我向您保证刘易斯夫人来之前
And I can promise you that the house will be ready

1568
02:08:35,384 --> 02:08:37,667
一切都会如期准备妥当
and in shape by the time Mrs. Lewis arrives.

1569
02:08:37,969 --> 02:08:39,753
好极了
That sounds good.

1570
02:08:41,056 --> 02:08:44,048
下午我要见一个女管家应聘者
I'm expecting a possible new housekeeper this afternoon.

1571
02:08:44,393 --> 02:08:45,925
露丝?马斯普拉特夫人
A Mrs. Ruth Muspratt.

1572
02:08:46,269 --> 02:08:51,222
有很好的推荐信  她在苏塞克斯做过学校督导
Excellent references. She was matron at a boys' school in Sussex.

1573
02:08:51,566 --> 02:08:52,839
督导
A matron?

1574
02:08:54,903 --> 02:08:57,270
听上去好像她会好好监督言行举止
Sounds like she'll keep us from misbehaving.

1575
02:08:57,489 --> 02:09:00,482
-但愿  先生  -好吧
-I certainly hope so, sir. -Good.

1576
02:09:00,826 --> 02:09:02,734
很好  史蒂文斯  非常好
Good, Stevens. Very good.

1577
02:09:03,036 --> 02:09:06,571
这里是35年会议的那个宴会厅  记得吗
This is where we had that banquet back in '35. Remember?

1578
02:09:06,665 --> 02:09:10,606
我们都站起来  发表自己的观点
We all stood up and delivered ourselves of our principles.

1579
02:09:10,836 --> 02:09:14,527
天知道我说了什么  不知道有没有起作用
God knows what I said. Sure got worked up about it, though.

1580
02:09:15,007 --> 02:09:17,082
我到底说了什么  史蒂文斯
What did I say, anyway?

1581
02:09:18,802 --> 02:09:21,336
抱歉  先生  我那时忙着做事
I'm sorry, sir, I was too busy serving

1582
02:09:21,680 --> 02:09:23,713
没时间听你们的演说
to listen to the speeches.

1583
02:09:29,896 --> 02:09:31,679
我们有个访客来了
We got a visitor here.

1584
02:09:32,774 --> 02:09:34,265
当心
Be very careful.

1585
02:09:34,568 --> 02:09:36,726
过来  小家伙  过来
Come here. That's a boy. Come on.

1586
02:09:38,655 --> 02:09:40,021
慢慢来
Okay. Easy does it.

1587
02:09:43,160 --> 02:09:44,182
过来
Come on!

1588
02:09:47,331 --> 02:09:49,280
不要去吓它
You don't want to startle it.

1589
02:09:49,708 --> 02:09:50,949
它会下来的
It'll come down.

1590
02:09:55,422 --> 02:09:57,539
我们把窗打开
I think if we leave the window open

1591
02:10:03,764 --> 02:10:04,671
很好
