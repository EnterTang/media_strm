10年后再見
We'll meet again after ten years.

83

老時間  老地點
Same day. Same place.

84
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,490
看看誰混得更有人樣

85
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,710

我飛機都沒坐  他褲子也沒穿
I aborted a flight, he forgot his pants,

92
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,870
就是為了趕著見蘭柯

93
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,490
五年來杳無音信
5 years we've searched.

94
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,910
我們都不知道他是不是還活著
Don't know if he's alive.

95
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,700
你卻以為他會為了那個愚蠢的賭就會來

我知道他不會來

Come and see where I've reached and where he rots.

101
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,200
你知道蘭柯在哪兒
So you know where Rancho is?

102
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,370
是的
Yes.

103
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,740
哪兒
Where?

104
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,790
他在西姆拉
He is in Shimla.

105
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:33,240
他如風隨行
Free as the wind was he

106
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:40,080
像疾飛的風箏
Like a soaring kite was he

107
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:48,080
去向何方  讓我們追尋
Where did he go...let's find him

108
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,290
他如風隨行
Free as the wind was he

109
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,490
像疾飛的風箏
Like a soaring kite was he

110
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:16,990
去向何方  讓我們追尋
Where did he go...let's find him

111
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,370
我們順著小路前行
We were led by the path we took

112
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,740
他正為自己開辟新徑
While he carved a path of his own

113
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:32,330
充滿迷惑  充滿新奇  充滿歡樂
Stumbling, rising, carefree walked he

114
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,080
我們的明天充滿未知
We fretted about the morrow

115
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:40,450
他卻今朝有酒今朝醉
He simply reveled in today

116
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:46,410
每一分鐘都活得那么充實
Living each moment to the fullest

117
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,990
他到底來自何方
Where did he come from...

118
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,330
觸碰了我們的心然后銷聲匿跡
He who touched our hearts and vanished...

119
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,950
他要去往何方  讓我們找尋
Where did he go...let's find him

120
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,830
在熾熱的太陽下  他是一片綠蔭
In scorching sun, he was like a patch of shade...

121
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,200
在荒蕪的沙漠里  他是一抹綠洲
In an endless desert, like an oasis...

122
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:23,200
破碎的心  由他為你填補
On a bruised heart, like soothing balm was he

123
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,490
恐懼  我們困在深井之中
Afraid, we stayed confined in the well

124
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,830
無畏  他卻嬉戲于其中
Fearless, he frolicked in the river

125
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:37,540
毫不猶豫撲向洶涌的潮汐
Never hesitating to swim against the tide

126
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,490
他獨身漫步云端
He wandered lonesome as a cloud

127
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,660
他是我們最親密的朋友
...yet he was our dearest friend

128
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,830
他將去向何方  讓我們追尋
Where did he go...let's find him

129
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,040

從一開始我們就被灌輸

人生就像一場比賽
life is a race,

134
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,580
要么超越別人  要么就落后
run fast or you'll be trampled.

135
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,050
就連生命的誕生

136
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,120
都是3億精子競爭的結果

142
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,080
沒人關心我真的想做什么
What I wanted to be...no one asked.

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,620
等下  拿著
Hey wait, hold this.

153
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,910
這是小千  小兆  還有他們老媽小億
Meet Kilobyte, Megabyte and their mother Gigabyte.

154
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,990
能摸的  他們不咬人
Go ahead, this family doesn't bite.

155
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,540
跟他打個招呼  那個虔誠的教徒
Check him out...another God-fearing soul.

156
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,640
你好  我是法爾漢·庫瑞什
Hi, Farhan Qureshi

157
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,540
我是拉賈·瑞絲奇
I'm Raju Rastogi

158
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,040
別擔心
Don't worry.

159
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,450
用不了多久他就回歸塵世間了
A few days here and he'll lose faith in God.

160
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,410
?暀W掛滿靚妞  然后念叨著
Then naked babes will be on the wall, and he'll say

161
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,910
神啊  賜我個妞吧
oh God, give me one chance with her.

162
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,660
快滾出去
Get out of here!

163
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,540
4塊錢  一個包2塊
Four bucks. Two per bag.

164
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,490
給你5塊  不用找了
Here's five. Keep the change.

165
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,370
謝了  老板
Thanks boss.

166
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,950
給你個小提示做為報答
For your tip, here's one in return

167
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,120
今晚穿上你最性感的內褲
wear your best underwear tonight.

168
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,580
為什么
Why?

169
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,200
我敬愛的陛下  您崇高偉大
Your majesty, thou art great.

170
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,410
請接受這謙卑的問候
Accept this humble offering.

171
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,540
這家伙夠男人
Here's a he-man.

172
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,590
這瓣真漂亮
What a pretty piece.

173
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,240
可愛又翹
Cute and compact.

174
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,040
學校的老規矩  第一天報道...
A campus tradition-on day 1...

175
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,740
新人必須對學長們表示一下尊敬
Freshmen must pay their respects to seniors,

176
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,120
以脫到只剩內褲的方式
in their underwear.

177
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,660
這是我們第一次見到蘭柯
This is when we first saw Rancho.

178
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,120
蜘蛛俠
Spiderman.

179
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,540
蝙蝠俠
Batman.

180
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,080
新鮮貨色
Fresh meat.

181
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,650
先問候一下
Greetings.

182
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,660
然后脫掉褲子  蓋個章
Drop your pants, get stamped!

183
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,620
叫什么
Name?

184
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,450
蘭柯霍達斯·沙瑪達斯·昌恰德
Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad.

185
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,620
真拗口  要好好記一下
What a mouthful! Needs serious cramming.

186
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,410
來吧  脫褲子
Come on, pants off.

187
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,740
這么不乖?
Being stubborn?

188
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,270
褲子濕了可不好受  老兄
Wet pants not good, kiddo.

189
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:35,700
快脫掉
Take them off.

190
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,870
什么
What's that?

191
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,620
他剛說什么
What did he say?

192
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,950
誰來告訴他  詹姆斯·邦德
Someone tell him. Hey James Bond.

193
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,290
教教他規矩
Make him understand.

194
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,200
快脫褲子吧  不然他們會在你身上撒尿
Take off your pants or they are going to piss on you.

195
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,870
零零柒  說母語很丟臉嗎
Hey 007! Ashamed to speak Hindi?

196
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:56,540
抱歉  我是烏干達人  在龐第皆瑞上的學
Sorry sir, I was born in Uganda, studied in Pondicherry.

197
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,080
所以不太懂印度話
So little slow in Hindi.

198
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,370
那就說慢點  別急
So explain slowly. No hurry.

199
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,790
冷嗎
Feeling cold?

200
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:12,740
脫褲子  不然他就對你尿刑伺候
Pray undress or he'll do 'urine-expulsion' on you.

201
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,660
尿刑伺候
Calls pissing 'urine-expulsion'!

202
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,540
真是太有才了
A true linguist in the land of engineers!

203
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,740
別躲起來
Hey, come out of there.

204
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,290
快出來  不然...
Come out or...

205
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,580
不然我就對你的門尿刑伺候
Or I'll do 'urine-expuision' on your door.

206
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,120
我數到10  你還不出來的話
If you aren't out by the count of ten,

207
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:57,450
我以后每天都對你的門尿刑伺候
I'll do 'urine-expulsion' on your door all semester.

208
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,240
1
One.

209
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,700
2
Two.

210
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,200
3
Three.

211
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,080
4
Four.

212
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,290
5
Five.

213
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,830
6
Six.

214
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,330
7
Seven.

215
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:53,950
8
Eight.

216
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,290
9
Nine.

217
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,990
10
Ten.

218
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,810
鹽水可以做為電的導體
Salt water is a great conductor of electricity.

219
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,330
初中生都知道
8th grade physics.

220
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,410
我們只學了課本
We had studied it.

221
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,540
他卻學以致用
He applied it.

222
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:13,790
韋魯·薩哈斯布達教授是ICE的校長 [皇家工程學院的縮寫]
Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe was the director of ICE.

223
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,290
學生們都稱他為病毒  電腦病毒
Students called him Virus, computer virus.

224
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,240
病毒入侵  還帶著蛋
Virus on the way, with eggs.

225
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,040
新生們集合  動作快點
Freshmen are summoned. Come quickly!

226
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,910
病毒是我見過最好勝的人
Virus was the most competitive man we had ever seen.

227
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,290
他無法忍受任何人超越他
He couldn't bear anyone getting ahead of him.

228
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,290
為了節約時間  他襯衫用魔術貼
To save time, his shirts had velcro.

229
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,950
領帶是直接勾上去的
And his ties had hooks.

230
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:46,540
他鍛煉自己用兩只手同時寫字
He'd trained his mind to write with both hands simultaneously.

231
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,240
每天下午兩點小睡一會兒
Everyday at 2 PM he took a 7 minutes power nap,

232
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,910
聽著歌劇入眠
with an opera as lullaby.

233
00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,730
戈爾文
Govind,

234
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:00,580
他的仆人  按命令行事
his valet, had instructions,

235
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,900
卻總是做些沒有意義的事情
to carry out all unproductive tasks.

236
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,830
比如修面  剪指甲等等
Such as shaving, nail-cutting etc.

237
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,410
-這是什么  -鳥窩  先生
- What is this? - Sir, nest.

238
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,830
-誰的  -這只杜鵑的
- Whose? - A koel bird's nest, sir.

239
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:29,910
錯
Wrong.

240
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,830
杜鵑從不自己做窩
A koel bird never makes her own nest.

241
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:36,370
她在別人窩里下蛋
She lays her eggs in other nests.

242
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,240
當她們的蛋孵出來后  會怎么做
And when they hatch, what do they do?

243
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:48,830
她們把其他的鳥蛋推出去
They push the other eggs out of the nest.

244
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,790
這樣就沒有了競爭對手
Competition over.

245
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,660
他們生來就是殺手  這就是大自然
Their life begins with murder. That's nature.

246
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,080
生死殊斗
Compete or die.

247
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,160
你們就像杜鵑
You also are like the koel birds,

248
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:14,870
而這些就是你們為了進ICE所打破的蛋
and these are the eggs you smashed to get into ICE.

249
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:20,330
記住  ICE每年要收到40萬份申請
Don't forget, ICE gets 400,000 applications a year.

250
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:24,870
只有200份能脫穎而出  就是你們
And only 200 are selected - you!

251
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,200
剩下這些呢
And these?

252
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,550
事實證明
Finished.

253
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,120
都成了破碎的蛋
Broken eggs.

254
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,740
我兒子...他努力了三年
My son...he tried for three years.

255
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,160
每次都被拒了
Rejected. Every time.

256
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,120
記著  人生就像一場競賽
Remember, life is a race.

257
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,370
如果你不跑快點就注定被別人超越
If you don't run fast, you'll get trampled.

258
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,950
跟你們說個有意思的事情
Let me tell you a very interesting story.

259
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,490
這是支太空筆
This is an astronaut pen.

260
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,410
鋼筆和圓珠筆在太空里無法使用
Fountain pens and ballpoint pens don't work in outer space.

261
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:02,490
所以科學家們花費了百萬研發出這支筆
So scientists spent millions to invent this pen.

262
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,040
它可以用在任何情況下
It can write at any angle,

263
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,160
任何溫度中甚至失重狀態下
in any temperature, in zero gravity.

264
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,330
有天  我那時還是學生
One day, when I was a student,

265
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,370
我們院主任給我打了個電話
the director of our institute called me,

266
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:14,080
"韋魯·薩哈斯布達"  他叫我名字
he said, 'Viru Sahastrabuddhe.' I said, 'yes sir.'

267
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,660
讓我去他那里  當時我有點惶恐
'come here!' I got scared.

268
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,240
他給我看了這支筆
He showed me this pen.

269
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,990
跟我說那是成功的標志
He said, 'this is a symbol of excellence.'

270
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,830
"我把它贈予給你"
'I give it to you,'

271
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,580
"當你遇到一個跟你同樣優秀的人"
'when you come across an extraordinary student like yourself

272
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,870
"把這個傳給他"
...pass it onto him.'

273
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,290
32年了  我一直在等那個人出現
For 32 years, I've been waiting for that student.

274
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,830
但都沒能如愿
But no luck.

275
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,660
在場各位  誰想贏得這支筆
Anyone here, who'll strive to win this pen?

276
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,480
很好
Good.

277
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,370
放下手
Put your hands down.

278
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,980
需要我發布在公告欄上嗎
Shall I post it on the notice board?

279
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,450
放下手
Hands down.

280
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,240
有個問題  校長
One question, sir.

281
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,200
如果鋼筆不能在太空使用
Sir, if pens didn't work in outer space,

282
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,370
那為什么宇航員不用鉛筆
why didn't the astronauts use a pencil?

283
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,290
這樣他們就能省下那筆錢
They'd have saved millions.

284
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,740
我一會兒回答你
I will get back to you on this.

285
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:30,040
他昨晚弄倒一個學長
He zaps a senior's privates at night.

286
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,110
今天又讓校長當眾出糗
Fingers the director in the day.

287
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,490
我們最好離他遠點
Best avoid him.

288
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,740
你銼了校長的銳氣
You deflated Virus's erection.

289
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,350
我敬愛的陛下  您崇高偉大
Your majesty, thou art great.

290
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,790
請接受這謙卑的問候
Accept this humble offering.

291
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,160
別扯了
Buzz off.

292
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,370
你不用上學嗎
You don't have school?

293
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,290
誰給學費  你老爸嗎
Who'll pay for it? Your pop?

294
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:47,700
-不許再提我老爸  -稍安勿躁
- Keep off my Dad! - Relax.

295
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,700
上學不用交學費  關鍵是校服
For school you don't need tuition money, just a uniform.

296
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:57,330
選個學校  買套校服  偷偷溜進去
Pick a school, buy the uniform, slip into class.

297
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,620
大家都穿一樣的  沒人會注意到你的
In that sea of kids, no one will notice.

298
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,040
-萬一被發現了呢  -那就重新找個學校
- If I get caught? - Then new uniform, new school.

299
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,410
-看到沒  -他確實不一般...
- See that? - He was different...

300
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:09,080
他敢于挑戰所有的規則
He challenged conventions at every stage.

301
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,410
一只熱愛自由的鳥兒占據了病毒的鳥窩
A free-spirited bird had landed in Virus's nest.

302
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:16,200
我們就像機器人  只會盲從著教授
We were robots, blindly following our professors' commands.

303
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:19,450
他是唯一一個與眾不同的
He was the only one who was not a machine.

304
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,080
機器是什么
What is a machine?

305
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,040
你笑什么呢
Why're you smiling?

306
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,240
教授  我兒時的夢想就是學工程
Sir, to study engineering was a childhood dream.

307
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,540
我很高興實現了夢想
I'm so happy to be here finally.

308
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,950
用不著這么高興  告訴我機器是什么
No need to be so happy. Define a machine.

309
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,790
機器就是減少人勞動力的東西
A machine is anything that reduces human effort.

310
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,580
你能說明白點嗎
Will you please elaborate?

311
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,500
任何使工作簡化
Anything that simplifies work,

312
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:56,370
節約時間的工具都是機器
or saves time, is a machine.

313
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,540
夏天天熱  只要按下按鈕  就會產生氣流
It's a warm day, press a button, get a blast of air.

314
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,990
電風扇  就是機器
The fan...A machine!

315
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,220
跟遠方的朋友聊天
Speak to a friend miles away.

316
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,790
用的電話  就是機器
The telephone...A machine!

317
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,790
計算機一秒百萬次換算
Compute millions in seconds.

318
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,040
計算器  也是機器
The calculator...A machine!

319
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,740
我們被機器所包圍
We're surrounded by machines.

320
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,100
無論是小小的筆尖還是褲子拉鏈
From a pen's nib to a pants' zip

321
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,790
全是機器的
all machines.

322
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,370
能快速拉上拉下
Up and down in a second.

323
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,620
上  下  上  下
Up, down, up, down...

324
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:21,910
那到底定義是什么
What is the definition?

325
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,330
我剛剛已經回答你了  教授
I just gave it to you, sir.

326
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,770
你考試的時候會這么寫嗎
You'll write this in the exam?

327
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,540
這就是機器  又上  又下
This is a machine - up, down...

328
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,330
白癡  還有誰會
Idiot! Anybody else?

329
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,910
就你吧
Yes?

330
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,580
教授  機器就是各種部分的結合體
Sir, machines are any combination of bodies so connected.

331
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,240
按照設定的指令工作
That their relative motions are constrained.

332
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,790
通過信號傳送
And by which means, force and motion may be transmitted.

333
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,200
使用螺絲等工具或者利用杠桿原理
And modified as a screw and its nut, or a lever arranged,

334
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,990
對樞軸的支點或滑輪進行調試
to turn about a fulcrum or a pulley about its pivot, etc.

335
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,200
尤其是其構造幾乎都由復雜的
Especially, a construction, more or less complex

336
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,820
活動零件組裝而成
consisting of a combination of moving parts,

337
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,710
或由簡單的機件部分
or simple mechanical elements,

338
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,620
如輪子  杠桿  凸輪等
as wheels, levers, cams etc.

339
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:55,910
棒級了
Wonderful!

340
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,660
非常好  請坐下
Perfect. Please sit down.

341
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,240
謝謝
Thank you.

342
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:03,660
教授  我說的是一樣的   表達得更簡潔
But sir, I said the same thing, in simple language.

343
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:07,830
喜歡少說話  那就去學藝術或者貿易
If you prefer simple language, join an arts and commerce college.

344
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,830
但是  我們必須搞明白
But sir, one must get the meaning too.

345
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:13,450
課本那種填鴨式教育到底想表達什么
What's the point of blindly cramming a bookish definition?

346
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,330
你覺得你比課本聰明嗎
You think you're smarter than the book?

347
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:20,660
把書上的概念背下  除非你不想通過考試
Write the textbook definition, mister, if you want to pass.

348
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,580
-但是也有的書...  -給我出去
- But there are other books... - Get out!

349
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,870
為什么
Why?

350
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,080
說簡單點  出去
In simple language, out!

351
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,870
白癡
Idiot!

352
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:42,410
我們剛才討論了機器的定義...
So, we were discussing the machine...

353
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,950
你怎么又回來了
Why're you back?

354
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,160
我落了東西
I forgot something.

355
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,660
什么
What?

356
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:52,120
一種包括記錄  分析  總結  組織
Instruments that record, analyze, summarize, organize,

357
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,270
討論  解釋于一體的
debate and explain information;

358
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,540
分為有插圖  無插圖
That are illustrated, non-illustrated.

359
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,580
硬裝本  平裝本  有封面  無封面
Hard-bound, paperback, jacketed, non jacketed.

360
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,700
附有前言  介紹  目錄  索引
With foreword, introduction, table-of-contents, index.

361
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,620
意在啟發  理解
That are intended for the enlightenment, understanding,

362
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,450
豐富  提升并培養人類大腦思維
enrichment, enhancement and education of the human brain.

363
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,700
通過想象力延伸  間或感受
Through the sensory route of vision, sometimes touch.

364
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,490
你在說什么
What do you mean?

365
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,040
書  教授
Books, sir.

366
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,990
我忘了拿書  能拿嗎
I forgot my books. May I?

367
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,040
你就不能說簡單點嗎
Couldn't you ask simply?

368
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:22,660
我剛才試過了  不過好象行不通
I tried earlier, sir. It simply didn't work.

369
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,790
教授幾乎不讓蘭柯上他的課...
Professors kept Rancho mostly out...seldom in.

370
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,040
每當被轟出去  他就溜去上別的課
When thrown out of one class, he'd slip into another.

371
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,950
他說  第一年和最后一年是學知識的
He said - first year or fourth year, it's knowledge.

372
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:39,490
要抓緊
Just grab it.

373
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,290
他特立獨行
He was unlike any of us.

374
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,910
我們每天早上為了洗澡而爭搶
We fought for a shower every morning.

375
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,740
他只要有水就能洗
He'd bathe wherever he found water.

376
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:47,790
早  教授
Morning, sir.

377
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,490
他對機器充滿熱情
Machines were his passion.

378
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:56,040
能拆的他都拆
When he spotted them, he opened them.

379
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,370
有的能恢復原狀...
Some he could re-assemble...

380
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,790
有些卻不能
Some he couldn't.

381
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,160
還有另一個跟他很像的人
There was another, just like him.

382
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,200
喬伊·洛博
Joy Lobo.

383
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,660
校長  等等  校長
Sir. Excuse me, sir.

384
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,740
喬伊·洛博先生
Mr. Joy Lobo!

385
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:15,080
校長  我想問下畢業儀式是哪天...
Sir, if I could know the convocation dates...

386
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,040
怎么了
Why?

387
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,950
我父親要訂火車票
Dad wants to make train reservations.

388
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,710
我是俺們那村第一個工程師
I'm the first engineer from my village.

389
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,830
大家都想來看看
Everyone wants to attend.

390
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,910
要是那樣的話  給你爸打電話
In that case, call your Dad.

391
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,560
動作快點
Please hurry up.

392
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,490
別浪費我時間
Don't waste my time.

393
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,950
喂?
Hello.

394
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,120
爹  校長要跟你說話
Dad, the director wants to speak to you.

395
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,290
喬伊
Joy!

396
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,910
洛博先生  你兒子今年不能畢業
Mr. Lobo, your son won't graduate this year.

397
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:44,410
怎么了  校長
What happened, sir?

398
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,660
他總是拖延功課
He has violated all deadlines.

399
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,450
洛博先生
Mr. Lobo,

400
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,740
不切實際的東西用來干嗎
it's an unrealistic project.

401
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,790
一天到晚擺弄那些無聊的飛機
He is making some nonsense helicopter.

402
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,550
建議你不要訂火車票了
I suggest you don't book your tickets.

403
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,700
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

404
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,420
校長  我可以畢業的  校長
Sir, I am this close, sir.

405
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,330
你的課題完成了嗎
Is your project ready?

406
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,700
你的課題完成了嗎
Is your project ready?

407
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,700
校長  請你看一眼這個
Sir, see it once, please.

408
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,450
把課題交上  學校才會考慮下
Submit it, and we'll consider.

409
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,630
校長  再給我點時間
Sir, a small extension...

410
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,950
為什么  我為什么要再給你點時間
Why, why should I?

411
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,160
我爸中風后的兩個月我都沒辦法集中精力
After Dad's stroke, I couldn't focus for two months.

412
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,540
那你飯也不吃了嗎
Did you stop eating?

413
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,080
不是
No.

414
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,200
澡也不洗了?
Stopped bathing?

415
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
不是
No.

416
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,240
那你為什么不學習
So why stop studying?

417
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:21,920
校長  我真的快弄好了
Sir, I'm very close.

418
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,080
求你了  就看一眼...
See it once, please...

419
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,370
洛博先生
Mr. Lobo!

420
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,580
我兒子星期天下午從火車上摔下來死了
Sunday afternoon, my son fell off a train and died.

421
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,640
星期一早上我還是照常去上課
Monday morning, I taught a class.

422
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,830
所以別跟我說這些廢話
So don't give me that nonsense.

423
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,990
我同情你  但不會給你延長時限
I can give you sympathy, not an extension.

424
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,660
校長  我真的快要做好了...
Sir...I'm very close...

425
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,740
我的這一生
Life long I lived.

426
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,160
都為著別人而活
The life of another.

427
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,660
哪怕只有一瞬間
For just one moment,

428
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,410
讓我為自己而活
let me live as I...

429
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,580
我的這一生
Life long I lived.

430
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:25,080
都為著別人而活
The life of another.

431
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,370
哪怕只有一瞬間
For just one moment,

432
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,200
讓我為自己而活
let me live as I...

433
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:44,870
給我點陽光  給我點雨露
Give me some sunshine. Give me some rain.

434
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:50,080
再給我一次機會讓我重新成長
Give me another chance I wanna grow up once again.

435
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,700
給我點陽光  給我點雨露
Give me some sunshine. Give me some rain.

436
00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:00,790
再給我一次機會讓我重新成長
Give me another chance I wanna grow up once again.

437
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,240
這家伙的設計棒得驚人
Dude's come up with an amazing design.

438
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,080
給直升機裝上無線攝像頭
A wireless camera atop a helicopter.

439
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,580
可以用于查看實時路況和安全監管
Can be used for traffic updates, security.

440
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:12,310
但是病毒那老頭說這個設計不實用
But Virus said it's an impractical design.

441
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:12,870
它不會飛
It won't fly.

442
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,160
它會飛的  我們能讓它飛起來
It will fly! We'll make it fly.

443
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,660
別告訴喬伊  給他個驚喜
Don't tell Joy. It'll be a surprise.

444
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,700
我們可以讓它飛到他窗口拍下他的反應
We'll fly it up to his window and capture his reaction.

445
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,410
如果我們幫他做項目  誰來幫我們做
If we work on his project, who'll work on ours?

446
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:28,990
筆試口試測試  每學期有42場考試
Tests, vivas, quizzes - 42 exams per semester.

447
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,830
兄弟你真容易退縮
You scare easily, bro.

448
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,450
把你的手按在胸口說  平安無事
Take your hand, put it over your heart, and say, 'aal izz well'.

449
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,830
-平安無視?  -是平安無事啦
- All is well? - Aal izz well.

450
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,490
精神領袖蘭柯霍達斯的至理名言
Words of wisdom from his holiness guru Ranchhoddas.

451
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,120
我們村以前有個巡夜老人
We had an old watchman in our village.

452
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:50,200
每次他巡夜的時候就會喊  平安無事
On night patrol, he'd call out, 'aal izz well'.

453
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:54,330
我們就睡得很安穩  后來來了個小偷
And we slept peacefully. Then there was a theft.

454
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,580
我們才知道那老頭有夜盲癥
And we learned that he couldn't see at night!

455
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:00,330
他只是喊句平安無事  我們就感到安全
He'd just yell 'aal izz well', and we felt secure.

456
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,790
從那天我明白了  我們的心很容易動搖
That day I understood this heart scares easily.

457
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,620
你得學會哄它
You have to trick it.

458
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,980
不管問題多嚴重
However big the problem,

459
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,580
告訴你的心  "伙計  平安無事"
tell your heart, 'all is well, pal'.

460
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,540
這能解決問題嗎
That resolves the problem?

461
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,580
不能  但是你得到了面對問題的勇氣啊
No. But you gain courage to face it.

462
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,450
學著點兄弟  我們很快就會需要這個的
Learn it up, bro. We're gonna really need it here.

463
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,580
當生活失去控制  就動動你的嘴唇
When life spins out of control just let your lips roll.

464
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:57,490
動動你的嘴唇  用口哨吹走煩惱
Let your lips roll and whistle away the toll.

465
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:05,290
當生活失去控制  就動動你的嘴唇
When life spins out of control just let your lips roll.

466
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:09,240
動動你的嘴唇  用口哨吹走煩惱
Just let your lips roll and whistle away the toll.

467
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:13,330
大喊平安無事
Yell - all is well...

468
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:16,620
雞們不知道蛋的命運
The chicken's clueless about the egg's fate.

469
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,620
是孵化還是變成蛋卷
Will it hatch or become an omelette.

470
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:24,620
沒人知道未來會怎樣
No one knows what the future holds.

471
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,240
所以動動你的嘴唇  用口哨吹走煩惱
So let your lips roll and whistle away the toll.

472
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:31,740
用口哨吹走煩惱  平安無事
Whistle away the toll yell. All is well.

473
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,830
兄弟們  平安無事
Hey bro. All is well.

474
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:40,200
哥們  平安無事
Hey mate. All is well.

475
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:44,200
兄弟們  平安無事
Hey bro. All is well.

476
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:57,200
困惑越來越多  解決方法卻沒幾個
Confusion and more confusion no sign of any solution.

477
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:01,370
終于有了辦法  等等  問題是什么
Finally a solution but wait. What was the question?

478
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,540
如果懦弱的心  怕得快要死了
If the timid heart with fear is about to die.

479
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:08,620
用一個簡單的謊言  讓它不再害怕
Then con it bro, with this simple lie.

480
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,540
心是個傻瓜  它會相信你的話
Heart's an idiot, it will fall under that spell.

481
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,240
動動你的嘴唇  用口哨吹走煩惱
Let your lips roll and whistle away the toll.

482
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:19,580
用口哨吹走煩惱  平安無事
Whistle away the toll yell. All is well.

483
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,990
兄弟們  平安無事
Hey bro. All is well.

484
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,870
哥們  平安無事
Hey mate. All is well.

485
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,790
兄弟們  平安無事
Hey bro. All is well.

486
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:45,240
酒能讓獎學金泡湯  卻不能讓憂愁跑掉
Blew the scholarship on booze but that did not dispel my blues.

487
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:49,200
熏香點燃我的命運  而神靈卻不見蹤影
Holy incense lit up my plight and yet God's nowhere in sight.

488
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:52,540
小羊羔不知道自己命運
The lamb is clueless for what it's destined.

489
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:56,580
是被烤還是剁成肉醬
Will it be served on skewers or simply minced.

490
00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:00,620
沒人知道未來會怎樣
No one knows what the future holds.

491
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,160
所以動動你的嘴唇  用口哨吹走煩惱
So let your lips roll and whistle away the toll.

492
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:07,740
用口哨吹走煩惱  平安無事
Whistle away the toll yell. All is well.

493
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,620
兄弟們  平安無事
Hey bro. All is well.

494
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:15,450
哥們  平安無事
Hey mate. All is well.

495
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:19,740
兄弟們  平安無事
Hey bro. All is well.

496
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,200
當生活失去控制  就動動你的嘴唇
When life spins out of control just let your lips roll.

497
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:31,490
就動動你的嘴唇  用口哨吹走煩惱
Just let your lips roll and whistle away the toll.

498
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:35,200
平安無事
All is well.

499
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:38,370
雞們不知道蛋的命運
The chicken's clueless about the egg's fate.

500
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:42,580
是孵化還是變成蛋卷
Will it hatch or become an omelette.

501
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:46,370
沒人知道未來會怎樣
No one knows what the future holds.

502
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,240
所以動動你的嘴唇  用口哨吹走煩惱
So let your lips roll and whistle away the toll.

503
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:50,870
用口哨吹走煩惱
Whistle away the toll.

504
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,080
有了  有了
Eureka! Eureka!

505
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:57,790
平安無事
All is well.

506
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:01,910
雞小姐  平安無事
Mrs. Chicken. All is well.

507
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:05,740
羊羔先生  平安無事
Mr. Lamb. All is well.

508
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:09,790
兄弟們  平安無事
Hey bro. All is well.

509
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:12,040
讓它飛到喬伊的窗口去
Hey, take it up to Joy's window.

510
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,790
再高點
Take it higher.

511
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,290
快看屏幕  那哥們光著呢
Look at silencer - the nude dude!

512
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,290
喬伊  快出來
Joy, come out.

513
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,870
到窗戶這邊來
Come to the window.

514
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,450
喬伊  看外面
Joy, look outside.

515
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:50,420
我放棄

516
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:12,660
給我點陽光  給我點雨露
Give me some sunshine. Give me some rain.

517
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:20,220
再給我一次機會讓我重新成長
Give me another chance I wanna grow up once again.

518
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:21,660
有個好消息  校長
Good news, sir.

519
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,040
警察和喬伊的爸爸都沒有線索
The police and Joy's father have no clue.

520
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:28,660
大家都覺得是自殺
Everyone thinks this is suicide.

521
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,080
尸檢報告說
The post mortem report

522
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,700
死亡原因是氣管壓力過大
Intense pressure on windpipe

523
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:35,910
導致窒息
resulting in choking.

524
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:42,620
大家都覺得他死于氣管壓力
All think the pressure on the jugular killed him.

525
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:47,290
那這4年來的精神壓力呢
What about the mental pressure for the last four years?

526
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,160
報告里沒提
That's missing in the report.

527
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,790
工程師是群聰明人
Engineers are a clever bunch.

528
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:58,580
但他們卻沒能造出可以測量精神壓力的機器
They haven't made a machine to measure mental pressure.

529
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,370
如果他們造出來了  大家都會知道...
If they had, all would know...

530
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,990
這不是自殺  這是謀殺
This isn't suicide...it's murder.

531
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:13,120
你怎么敢把喬伊的死歸咎于我
How dare you blame me for Joy's suicide?

532
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,880
如果一個學生不能處理好自己的壓力
If one student can't handle pressure,

533
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,830
就是我們的錯了嗎
is it our fault?

534
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:20,910
生活充滿了壓力  你會總是怪罪別人嗎
Life is full of pressures. Will you always blame others?

535
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:25,160
我沒有怪你  校長  我怪的是這體制
I don't blame you, sir. I blame the system.

536
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:30,790
看看這些數據  印度的自殺率排在第一
Look at these statistics. India ranks No.1 in suicides.

537
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,870
每90分鐘  就有一個學生企圖自殺
Every 90 minutes, a student attempts suicide.

538
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,450
自殺死的人比病死的人還多
Suicide is a bigger killer than disease.

539
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,990
我們有些地方錯得很嚴重  校長
Something's terribly wrong, sir.

540
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,370
其他的我不敢說
I can't speak for the rest.

541
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,990
但這里是全國最好的學校之一
But this is one of the finest colleges in the country.

542
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,660
我在這兒管了32年
I've run this place for 32 years.

543
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,450
我們學校的排名從28升到現在第一
We were ranked 28th. Now we're No.1.

544
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,200
那有什么意義  校長
What's the point, sir?

545
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:59,200
在這里  新想法新發明沒人關心
Here they don't discuss new ideas or inventions.

546
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,910
人們只關心成績  工作  去美國定居
They discuss grades, jobs, settling in the USA.

547
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,120
教我們怎么拿高分  卻沒教我們工程學
They teach how to get good scores. They don't teach engineering.

548
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,490
現在輪到你來教我怎么教書了嗎
Now you will teach me how to teach?

549
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:15,870
不是  校長  我...
No, sir, I...

550
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,200
校長  我的資料...
Sir, my paper...

551
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,200
韋德顏納森  坐下
Vaidyanathan, please sit down.

552
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,870
這里有位自稱是教授的人
Here is a self-proclaimed professor

553
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:49,040
他覺得自己比我們的優秀教師還要厲害
who thinks he is better than our highly qualified teachers.

554
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:54,200
蘭柯霍達斯·昌恰德教授現在給我們上工程學
Professor Ranchhoddas Chanchad will teach us engineering.

555
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,450
我們沒那么多時間陪你耗
We do not have all day.

556
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:15,450
法哈尼楚特  柏饒拉朱利

557
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:55,660
你們有30秒時間來定義這兩個詞
You have 30 seconds to define these terms.

558
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,120
可以翻書
You may refer to your books.

559
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,740
找到答案了就舉手
Raise your hand if you get the answer.

560
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,410
讓我們看看誰最快  誰最慢
Let's see who comes first, who comes last.

561
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:09,490
計時  開始
Your time starts...now.

562
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,040
時間到
Time up.

563
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,580
時間到了  校長
Time up, sir.

564
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:47,830
沒人找到答案嗎
No one got the answer?

565
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:53,700
現在把你的人生往回倒一分鐘
Now rewind your life by a minute.

566
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,460
當我問這個問題的時候
When I asked this question,

567
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,740
你們激動嗎  好奇嗎
were you excited? Curious?

568
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:00,660
為你能學到新知識而高興嗎
Thrilied that you'd learn something new?

569
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:03,870
有人有這種感覺嗎  校長
Anyone? Sir?

570
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:09,620
沒有  你們都陷入了一場瘋狂的比賽
No. You all got into a frantic race.

571
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,790
這樣的方法有什么用  即使你拿了第一
What's the use of such methods, even if you come first

572
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,410
你的知識多了嗎  不  多的只有壓力
will your knowledge increase? No, just the pressure.

573
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:21,870
這里是大學  不是高壓鍋
This is a college, not a pressure cooker.

574
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,530
就算是馬戲團的獅子也會因為害怕被鞭打
Even a circus lion learns to sit on a chair

575
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:27,620
而學會坐在椅子上
in fear of the whip.

576
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,180
但是你們只會說這只獅子是訓練得好
But you call such a lion "well trained",

577
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,200
而不是教育得好
not "well educated".

578
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,240
喂
Hello!

579
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:38,330
這不是哲學課  解釋那兩個詞就好了
This is not a philosophy class. Just explain those two words.

580
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,410
校長  這兩詞根本不存在
Sir, these words don't exist.

581
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:44,910
只是我兩個朋友的名字  法爾漢和拉賈
These are my friends' names. Farhan and Raju.

582
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:58,370
安靜
Quiet!

583
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:02,700
亂來  你就這么教工程學嗎
Nonsense! Is this how you'll teach engineering?

584
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,080
校長  我不是在教工程學
Sir, I wasn't teaching you engineering.

585
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,160
你才是工程學的專家
You're an expert at that.

586
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,240
我只是在教你  怎么教書
I was teaching you how to teach.

587
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,990
我相信總有一天你能學會
And I'm sure one day you'll learn.

588
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,990
因為我不像你  我不會放棄我的差生
Because unlike you, I never abandon my weak students.

589
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,490
再見  校長
Bye, sir.

590
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,660
安靜
Quiet!

591
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,330
我說了  安靜
Quiet, I said.

592
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:35,160
我很遺憾地通知您  您的兒子...
I regret to inform you that your son...

593
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:36,410
法爾漢  拉賈
Farhan. Raju.

594
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:37,740
由于交友不慎
Has fallen into bad company.

595
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:41,240
如不盡快撥亂反正  將前途盡廢
Without urgent corrective steps, his future will be ruined.

596
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:45,620
病毒的信像原子彈一樣投到了我們的家里
Virus's letters dropped on our homes like atom bombs.

597
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:48,370
廣島和長崎一片廢墟
Hiroshima and Nagasaki plunged into gloom.

598
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:51,540
我們的父母把我們叫回家狠狠地罵了一頓
Our parents invited us for a dressing down.

599
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,740
進來
Come in.

600
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:58,240
看到沒?
See that?

601
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:02,200
我們只用得起一臺空調
We could afford just one air-conditioner.

602
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:06,450
我們把它放在法爾漢的房間
We put it in Farhan's room,

603
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,620
讓他可以安心學習
so he could study in comfort.

604
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:13,040
我買不起車  就騎個小摩托
I didn't buy a car. I manage with a scooter.

605
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:15,790
我們把所有的錢都花在法爾漢的教育上了
We put all our money into Farhan's education.

606
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:21,220
我們犧牲了自己的享受來換取法爾漢的未來
We sacrificed our comforts for Farhan's future.

607
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:21,410
你懂嗎
Understand?

608
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,410
這些是你照的嗎  法爾漢
You took these pictures, Farhan?

609
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:35,330
他曾經的無用嗜好
He had that useless obsession for a while.

610
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:37,950
到處去給動物拍照
Went around taking pictures of animals.

611
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,830
想做個野生動物攝影師
Wanted to be a wildlife photographer.

612
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,450
兒子  那年你考了多少分
Son, what was your score that year?

613
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:46,620
91分

614
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:51,620
聽到了吧  從94分直掉到91分
Hear that? Straight drop from 94% to 91%.

615
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,200
你覺得這很好笑嗎
You find it funny?

616
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:59,250
不是的  先生  對不起
No, sir, sorry.

617
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,950
我是被這些照片逗樂了
I'm just amazed at the photos.

618
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,230
為什么讓他當工程師
Why make him an engineer?

619
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:03,740
為什么不讓他做個野生動物攝影師
Why not a wildlife photographer?

620
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:05,080
夠了
Enough!

621
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:11,620
算我求求你了  別毀了我兒子的前途
I humbly request you - don't ruin my son's future.

622
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,490
飯好了  小伙子們  來吧
Food's on the table, boys. C'mon.

623
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:22,700
如果你下次拜訪  再和我們一起吃飯吧
If you ever visit again, do eat with us.

624
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,080
爸爸沒讓我們吃飯
Dad denied us a meal.

625
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,330
所以  為了填飽肚子
So, to fill our bellies with food.

626
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,990
我們帶著滿耳的訓斥去了拉賈家
And ears with more reprimands, we reached Raju's house.

627
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:37,400
拉賈的家就跟五十年代
Raju's house was straight out of

628
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,040
黑白電影里的一樣

633
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:48,830
一張彈簧外露的沙發
A sofa sprouting springs.

634
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:51,580
24小時自來水供應  就是屋頂漏的
A 24 hour water supply - from the leaking roof.

635
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:55,870
母親是個退休教師  喋喋不休地抱怨
Mother was a retired school teacher and a tireless complainer.

636
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:58,700
父親曾經是郵政局長
Father was once a postmaster.

637
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,620
癱瘓讓他的身體失去了部分功能

638
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,490
和全部的薪水  至于姐姐...

639
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,970
甘默已經28歲了

640
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,290
他們要輛車做嫁妝
They demand a car in dowry.

641
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:11,540
如果你不學習不掙錢  她怎么嫁得出去
If you don't study and earn, how will she marry?

642
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:12,950
要秋葵嗎
Some okra?

643
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:17,830
秋葵現在12塊一公斤  花椰菜是10塊
Okra is now 12 per kilo, cauliflower is 10.

644
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,580
簡直是搶劫
It's daylight robbery!

645
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:23,950
如果你被學校警告了  我們以后吃什么

646
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,120

647
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:27,660
要白軟干酪嗎

白軟干酪應該放天鵝絨盒里擺珠寶店賣

Mom, please.

651
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:38,620
好  我閉嘴
Alright, I'll shut up.

652
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:44,790
要養家糊口  要做牛做馬

653
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,290
還不給說話

654
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:50,840
不跟我兒子說我還能跟誰說

His friends?

656
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,790

Hey Raju.

657
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:02,370
我們進退兩難
We were in a huge dilemma.

658
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,120
不知該安慰我們的朋友還是他媽媽
Do we comfort our friend or console his Mom?

659
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:10,290
管他的  還是吃我們的干酪先
Screw it, we thought, let's focus on the cottage cheese.

660
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:25,040
現在連他的濕疹膏也要55塊了
Even his eczema cream costs 55 now.

661
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:31,120
再來塊烤肉嗎

662
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:34,410
不用了  謝謝  我們飽了

至少你們還吃了頓飯
At least you were offered a meal.

Uniike your sadistic Dad. "Hitler" Qureshi!

It's month end. Who'll pay?

671
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:04,240
他媽媽特雷莎付啊?
His mother Teresa?

672
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:07,350
出去吃不用帶錢
To eat out,

673
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:09,870
只要穿禮服就行了  看
you don't need money. Just a uniform. Look.

674
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,330
-走吧  -走

675
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:18,160
晚上好  晚上好
Good evening, good evening.

676

If we're caught, we're dead.

679
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:31,830
-開胃菜有什么  -要雙倍的
- What's for starters? - Get double portions.

680

Leave this here and start some peppy music.

681
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,370
琵雅  這是什么鬼東西
Pia, what the hell is this!

682
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:40,450
你為什么要戴這個破古董一樣沒用的表
Why're you wearing this ancient piece of junk?

683
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:45,240
人們會怎么說  我的未婚妻...
What'll people say? My fiancee...

684
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,010
一個前途無量的醫生

685
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:48,240
卻帶著個才200塊的廉價表

把它摘下來  謝謝

693
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:07,700
打擾一下
Excuse me.

694
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:11,040
怎么了
Yes?

695
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:12,410
這花送你
Flowers.

696
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:17,120
-介意我拿著玻璃杯嗎  -為什么
- May I take the glass? - Why?

697
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:19,700
這樣你就不會用它來砸我腦袋了
So you don't break it on my head.

698
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,740
我為什么要那么做
Why would I do that?

699
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,290
因為我現在要給你的免費建議
For the free advice I'll now impart.

700
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:26,330
是什么
What?

701
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:28,240
不要嫁給那個混蛋
Don't marry that ass.

702
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:30,240
什么
Excuse me?

703
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:32,160
那貨不是人  那貨是個價格標簽
He's not a human, he's a price tag.

704
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:35,580
他會把你人生變成只有牌子和價格的噩夢
He'll turn your life into a nightmare of brands and prices.

705
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,790
他會毀了你的生活和前途的
He'll ruin your life. Your future will be finished.

706
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:39,950
要讓我演示給你看嗎
Want a demonstration?

707
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,740
讓我來告訴你他的鞋是多少錢的怎么樣
Shall I find out the price of his shoes?

708
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:47,200
我不問  他就會自己告訴我
I won't ask. He'll announce it himself.

709
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:05,200
操  哪個孫子把薄荷醬灑我300刀的鞋上了
What the hell. Mint sauce on my $300 shoes!

710
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:07,810
為了你的人生快跑吧  這是免費建議
Run for your life! It's free advice.

711
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:08,540
聽不聽隨你
Take it or leave it.

712
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,790
真正的意大利皮革  手工的
Genuine italian leather - hand-stitched!

713
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,080
爸  他們是你的客人嗎
Dad, are they your guests?

714
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:25,700
是我的學生  他們在這干什么
My students. What're they doing here?

715
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:30,870
爸  等等
Hold on, Dad.

716
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:34,660
這些豆聞起來真香
These beans smell great.

717
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:37,120
-沒地方放烤肉了  -堆到上面去
- No room for roti. - Just pile it on.

718
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,990
真是讓人大開眼界  太謝謝你了
That was an eye-opener. Thank you so much.

719
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,790
這是我的道德義務
It was my moral responsibility.

720
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:50,990
能再幫我個小忙嗎
Can I ask you for little more help?

721
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,700
我爸不會讓我毀掉這個婚約的
Dad won't let me break off this engagement.

722
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:59,660
你比較會說  能不能也給他演示一下
You explain so well. Can you give him a demo too?

723
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:02,580
當然  拉賈  薄荷醬
Certainly. Raju, the mint sauce.

724
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,580
你真好人
You're really sweet.

725
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:08,870
-你爸爸在哪兒  -就在你后面
- Where is your Daddy? - Right behind you.

726
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,830
平安無事
Aai izz well.

727
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:20,610
為了你的人生快跑吧  這是免費建議
Run for your life! It's free advice.

728
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:21,790
聽不聽隨你
Take it or leave it.

729
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,620
你們在這里干什么
What're you doing here?

730
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:27,370
我們來把這些禮物交給新婚夫婦
We'll hand these gifts to the couple.

731
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:30,700
我幫你吧  這是我姐姐的婚禮
I'll do that for you. It's my sister's wedding.

732
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,290
姐姐?
Sister?

733
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,540
校長  你有幾個女兒啊
Sir, what's the sum total of your daughters?

734
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:39,990
空的  沒有支票
Empty. No gift cheques.

735
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:42,410
怎么把支票忘了  拉賈...法爾漢
Forgot the cheques, Raju...Farhan?

736
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:46,660
我們沒邀請你  你們是新郎的客人吧
We didn't invite you, you must be from the groom's side.

737
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:51,120
不  校長  我們代表著科學而來
No sir, we're here as the emissaries of science.

738
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:53,450
什么意思  你能解釋一下嗎
How? Can you explain?

739
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,380
爸爸  他這么能言善辯
Dad, he explains superbly.

740
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,370
我相信他會給我們一個解釋的
I'm sure he'll give us a demo.

741
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:58,620
對吧
Won't you?

742
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:03,040
新德里經常發生停電...
Well, Delhi has plenty of power cuts that...

743
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:05,620
這會打斷婚禮的行進
Disrupt wedding celebrations.

744
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:08,080
所以我想造個能從客人的汽車里抽取電能
So I thought of making an inverter that

745
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,620
的換流器
draws power from guests' cars.

746
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:12,200
我懂了
I see.

747
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:15,700
那換流器在哪兒呢
So where's the inverter?

748
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,120
校長  設計圖已經完成了的
Sir, the design is ready.

749
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,490
設計圖在哪兒呢  法爾漢
Where's the design, Farhan?

750
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:25,950
-我把它給你了的  -我給了拉賈
- I gave you the design - I gave it to Raju.

751
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:27,330
拉賈  設計圖呢
Raju, design?

752
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:34,160
別管設計圖了  我會造出換流器給你看
Never mind the design. I'll make the inverter and show you.

753
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:38,160
你只會造謠  哪會造什么換流器啊
You can only invent stories, not an inverter.

754
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:41,540
我會做出來的  我保證
I'll make one, I promise.

755
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:44,500
而且還會以您來命名
And I'll name it after you.

756
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:48,570
畢竟  這是在你女兒的婚禮上發明的
After all, it was invented at your daughter's wedding.

757
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:49,290
很榮幸...
So it'll be an honor...

758
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:55,450
法爾漢  拉賈  明天到我辦公室來
Farhan, Raju. I'll see you in my office tomorrow.

759
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:04,830
校長  每盤多少錢  我們還您
Sir, what was the cost per plate? We'll reimburse you.

760
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,830
...不過得按揭
...in instailments.

761
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:11,050
我們絕不會再亂闖婚禮了
We'll never crash a wedding again.

762
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:12,540
哪怕是我們自己的婚禮
Not even my own.

763
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,910
事實上  我甚至不會結婚  他也不會
In fact, I won't even marry. Nor will he.

764
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,620
對...不結婚
Uh...right. No marriage.

765
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,490
你們的父母也不該結婚
Your parents shouldn't have married either.

766
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,700
這世界本來可以少養兩個白癡的
The world would have to feed two less idiots.

767
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,240
坐下
Sit!

768
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:41,290
聽好了
Pay attention.

769
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:57,160
這是蘭柯霍達斯父親的月收入
This is Ranchhoddas's father's monthly income.

770
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:04,830
去掉兩個零也還是一筆可觀的收入
Couple of zeroes less, and it's still a sizeable income.

771
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:13,700
但是再去掉一個零  我就有點擔心了
But erase another zero, and I would worry a little.

772
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:18,330
這不是你爸爸的收入嗎  法爾漢
Isn't that your fathers income, Farhan?

773
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,910
是的  校長
Yes, sir.

774
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:24,330
再去掉一個零
Now take away another zero.

775
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:31,160
就變成你全家的收入了  賈·瑞絲奇
And that's your family income, Raju Rastogi.

776
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:33,700
真讓人擔心啊
Big reason to worry.

777
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:45,580
接受我的建議  搬去跟查特·雷曼寧甘一起住
Take my advice and shift into Chatur Ramalingam's room.

778
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,300
馬上要考試了
Exams are here.

779
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:50,240
你們再跟蘭柯混下去肯定不及格
Stay with Rancho and you're sure to fail.

780
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,580
-要刮胡子嗎  -不用  校長
- Want a shave? - No, sir.

781
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:15,620
那還不快滾
Then get lost!

782
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:29,700
別擔心  拉賈
Raju, don't worry.

783
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,450
病毒想要分裂我們  分而治之
This is Virus's move to split us. Divide and rule.

784
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:33,660
我不得不擔心
I have to worry.

785
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,410
他給我們打分
He grades us,

786
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:37,580
我需要個好分數來找個好工作
and I need good grades for a good job

787
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:41,540
我們不像你  有個有錢的爸爸
Unlike you, I don't have a rich Dad I can live off.

788
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:43,540
閉嘴  拉賈
Shut up, Raju.

789
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:46,450
我們非要聽他的廢話嗎  平安無事
Must we follow all his hogwash? 'aal izz well'

790
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:48,290
我才不會像你一樣當他的跟班
I won't be his flunky like you.

791
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:50,280
你有點過分了
You're crossing the line.

792
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,540
不  我是在畫好界限
No, I'm drawing one.

793
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,740
我要養家糊口
I have a family to support.

794
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:58,200
我爸的醫藥費花光了我媽的退休金
Dad's medicines swallow up Mom's pension.

795
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:04,540
我姐嫁不出去  因為他們要一輛車做嫁妝
My sis can't marry because they want a car in dowry.

796
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:11,700
我媽已經5年沒買過一件新的紗麗服了
Mom hasn't bought a single saree in five years

797
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:17,740
不要把你媽的衣柜也扯到這個問題里來
Now don't get your Mom's wardrobe into the debate.

798
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:20,870
順便問下  一年買幾件紗麗服才正常
By the way, how many sarees per annum is reasonable?

799
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:23,200
別開我媽的玩笑
Hey...no wisecracks about Mom.

800
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:28,200
我們要用心學習  而不是只為求個分數
We'll study with all our heart, but not just for grades.

801
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:33,200
智者說  學習是以修煉氣質而不為斂財
To quote a wise one -- study to be accomplished, not affluent

802
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:39,490
以優秀自律  成功自會隨你而來
Follow excellence, and success will chase you, pants down!

803
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:41,710
哪個智者說過這話
Which wise one says this?

804
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:43,330
又是精神領袖蘭柯霍達斯?
His holiness guru Ranchhoddas?

805
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:46,370
別扯淡了
Go rot in the bogs!

806
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,990
拉賈  放輕松  我們會考第一的  萬事皆有可能
Raju, don't stress. We'll top our class. Nothing is impossible.

807
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:52,450
萬事皆有可能?  真的嗎
Nothing is impossible? Oh yeah?

808
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,240
塞回管子里
Shove this back into the tube.

809
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:02,910
拉賈選擇了另一條路
Raju got onto another train.

810
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:06,040
他在查特手下的悲慘命運開始了
His travails with Chatur began.

811
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,620
沒錯  是悲慘命運  不是快樂的旅程
Yes, I mean travails, not travels.

812
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,950
查特綽號"消音器"
Chatur was called "silencer".

813
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:17,000
為了歷練自己的記憶力
To sharpen his memory,

814
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,990
他向一位赤腳庸醫求了幾粒藥丸
he popped pills from a local quack.

815
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:21,370
從此以后放屁不出聲  卻奇臭無比
And then let off silent...but lethal farts.

816
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:27,290
不是我...是拉賈放的吧
I didn't do it...Raju?

817
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:30,120
自己放屁卻總讓別人背黑鍋
He always blamed others for the output.

818
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:33,740
消音器每天苦讀18個小時
Silencer crammed 18 hours a day.

819
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,120
考試前夕  則想方設法分散他人注意力
On exam eve, he would distract others.

820
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:44,160
他堅信--人生登頂之路只有兩條
His belief -- there are only two ways of topping:

821
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:47,790
抬升自己的分數或者壓低對手的分數
elevate your own grades or shrink your opponents' grades.

822
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:55,950
蘭柯則想出了絕妙的辦法
Rancho decided to subdue silencer and rescue Raju

823
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:57,700
來幫助拉賈  消滅"消音器"
with one master plan.

824
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:04,710
我們的導師孜孜不倦地服務于...
Our director has unceasingly served...

825
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:07,740
"服務"的意思是...
"served" means...

826
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:11,870
管他什么意思  記住就行
Damn the meaning, I'll memorize it.

827
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:16,910
查特負責在教師節那天致詞
Chatur was the introductory speaker at the teachers' day function.

828
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:19,630
為了給病毒留下深刻印象
To impress Virus,

829
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:21,160
他找圖書管理員幫忙
he got his speech written by the librarian

830
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:22,700
寫一篇浮夸絢麗的文章來
in highbrow Hindi.

831
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:29,620
你好  稍等  查特  有電話
Hello. Hold on. Chatur, call for you.

832
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,410
幫我收一下打印稿  我去去就回
Please collect the printout. I'll be right back.

833
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,080
而我要做的是
Oh...the things I have to do.

834
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:43,830
杜別先生  校長念叨您呢
Mr. Dubey, the director was remembering you.

835
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:45,540
-真的嗎  -沒錯  剛還念叨呢
- Really? - Yes. Just now.

836
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:49,290
我這就去見他  把這個交給查特
I'll see him right away. Give this to Chatur.

837
00:57:54,450 --> 00:57:55,340
你好  喂?
Hello. Hello.

838
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:57,490
你好  雷曼寧甘先生嗎
Hello, Mr. Ramalingam?

839
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:58,540
什么事啊
Yes?

840
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,490
這里是警察局
I'm calling from the police station.

841
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:04,700
-你是烏干達來的嗎  -是的  長官
- Are you from Uganda? - Yes, sir.

842
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,920
你現在有生命危險
Your life is in danger.

843
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,290
什么  怎么回事
What? How?

844
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:12,200
聽好了  否則...
Listen carefully, or else...

845
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:17,160
你一邁出校門就得一命嗚呼
You'll get killed as you step out of the college gate.

846
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:19,160
為什么  出什么事了
Why? What happened?

847
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:20,870
查特被纏住的當兒
While Chatur was kept engaged,

848
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:24,900
蘭柯改了改演講稿里的幾個詞
Rancho altered a few words in his speech,

849
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:27,870
比如  把"服務"改成"壓榨"
for eg, 'served' became 'screwed'.

850
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:29,990
校長在嗎
Yes, sir?

851
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:33,080
-你是誰  -我叫杜別  圖書管理員
- Who are you? - Dubey. Librarian.

852
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:36,830
校長  我是終身任職的
I'm permanent staff, sir.

853
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:38,870
恭喜你
Congratulations.

854
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:42,660
等一下  警長在和我通話
Hold on a moment. The chief is on the other line.

855
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:43,990
喂?  你好
Excuse me, sir

856
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:55,910
那...我該去哪兒呢
Yes...so where was I?

857
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,580
你說我死定了...只要一出校門
You said I may die...outside the gate.

858
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:05,120
沒錯  你一出大門就會看見紅綠燈
Right. As you get out of the gate, you'll see a traffic signal.

859
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:07,370
紅綠燈  好的
Traffic signal. Ok.

860
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:13,120
紅燈亮時  所有的車輛都會停下來
When it turns red, all the cars will halt.

861
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:14,950
對  然后呢
Ok. Then?

862
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,080
小心翼翼地穿過馬路
Then cross the road with great caution.

863
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:22,120
因為孩子  在高峰時段被車撞的話
Because son, in rush hour if a car hits you,

864
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,080
就死定了
you're dead.

865
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,830
扯淡  我知道啊
What nonsense! I know that.

866
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:30,540
你知道了  好的  這樣你安全了
You know that? Excellent. Then you're safe my boy.

867
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:39,660
管理員給你的  消音器
From the librarian, silencer.

868
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:41,370
不許那么叫我  昌恰德
You don't call me that, Chanchad.

869
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,290
校長說他沒找過我
Hey. The director said he didn't call for me.

870
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:52,330
誰說他找你了  我是說他念叨你呢
Who said 'called'? I just said he 'remembered' you.

871
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:55,080
念叨?  你個淘氣包
Remembered? Rascais!

872
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,290
尊敬的主席先生
Distinguished Mr. Chairperson.

873
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:11,870
各位貴賓  令人敬仰的教育部長
Chief guest, the honorable minister of education.

874
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:16,450
各位敬愛的老師  同學們
Respected teachers and friends.

875
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:22,910
ICE的招牌已名揚四海
Ice has now soared beyond the stratosphere.

876
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:27,830
一切的溢美之詞
The credit goes solely to

877
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:31,440
卻都涌向韋魯·薩哈斯布達博士
Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe.

878
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:32,040
熱烈歡迎他
Give him a big hand.

879
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,280
校長  聲音是他的
Sir, the voice is his

880
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:36,200
可講稿卻出自我之手啊
but the words are mine.

881
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:39,200
他是一個偉人  您名副其實
He's a great guy, really you are.

882
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:48,870
32年來  他孜孜不倦地壓榨學生
For 32 years, he has unceasingly screwed students.

883
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:53,790
他是想說  "服務"學生
He means - 'served' students.

884
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,620
我堅信他的努力還將繼續
I'm sure his endeavors will continue.

885
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:03,130
我們不得不為他震驚  憑一己之力
We are astounded at how one man,

886
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:06,170
在一生中  竟可以壓榨如此多的學生
in one lifetime can screw so many,

887
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:07,450
且壓榨地淋漓盡致
so well.

888
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:15,830
他不斷地訓練以保持活力
With rigorous training he's built up his stamina.

889
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:26,160
他將生命的每一分鐘投入到壓榨中去
He's spent every living minute just screwing.

890
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:30,490
讓我們繼續他的事業
Let's replicate his methods.

891
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:39,950
明日我校的學生將走向世界各地
Tomorrow Ice students will go across the globe.

892
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:43,580
無論我們去往何方
Wherever we go,

893
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:46,830
我們都會將壓榨進行到底
we promise to screw.

894
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:54,080
我們會讓壓榨者的旗幟在全世界飄揚
We'll hoist this screwer's flag all over the world.

895
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:04,450
我會向世人展示我們壓榨的水平
We'll show the world that our capacity to screw

896
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:06,790
在地球上
cannot be matched by any student

897
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:10,580
將無人能及
anywhere on the planet.

898
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:21,330
部長先生  晚上好
Mr. Minister. Good evening.

899
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:29,410
您給予這所學院急需的東西
You have given this institution what it sorely needs.

900
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,790
-基金  -咪咪
- Booty, funds. - Bosom.

901
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:37,540
是基金  蠢貨  咪咪的意思是...
It's booty, stupid. Bosom means...

902
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:40,990
扯淡  太侮辱人了
What nonsense! That's insulting.

903
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:46,160
人人都有咪咪  但它被遮住了
Everyone has a bosom, but it remains pocketed.

904
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:49,740
沒有人愿意輕易奉送
No one offers it so readily.

905
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:54,700
同學們
Vulgar fellow!

906
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:56,490
你們無私地奉獻出了自己的咪咪
You have generously offered your bosom

907
01:02:56,870 --> 01:02:59,950
將它交給了這位永不知疲憊的壓榨者
to this relentless screwer.

908
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:07,160
讓我們看看  他是如何使之變大的吧
Now see how he makes it grow.

909
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:11,660
校長  你就教這些東西嗎
Is this what you teach here, director?

910
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:22,740
在這莊重的時刻  我愿引用梵文一句
On this august occasion, here's a sanskrit verse.

911
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:25,870
且聽--屁的力量
Listen to this -- the might of his fart in verse.

912
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:28,950
神圣崇高的屁是如此令人崇敬
A good loud fart is honorable

913
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,540
"屁"?  繼續  消音器
'fart'? Go, silencer.

914
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:34,580
半響的屁是可以忍受的
A medium fart is tolerable.

915
01:03:37,870 --> 01:03:41,450
輕微的小屁實在可怕
Softer windbreaks are terrible.

916
01:03:44,410 --> 01:03:49,330
而悠悠然的無聲屁則最令人發指
And the silent ones unbearable.

917
01:03:59,450 --> 01:04:02,410
這如同毫無意義的死記硬背
That's what mindless cramming does to you.

918
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:06,080
死記硬背陪伴你大學時代
Cramming may see you through four years of college.

919
01:04:06,330 --> 01:04:10,160
而且它將陪伴你走過人生的另外40年
But it will 'screw' you for the next 40 years.

920
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:13,990
他還沒發覺問題呢
He still doesn't get it.

921
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:24,490
"半響屁可以忍受"...難以置信
'medium fart is tolerable'...unbelievable!

922
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:26,520
蘭柯  你真是位詩人
You're a poet, rancho.

923
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:27,410
你咋想出來這招的
How did you think of this?

924
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:32,240
這樣多有趣  他都不知道哪兒觸犯了部長
That was fun. He didn't know what hit him.

925
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:38,080
你這頭豬  我平日怎么待你的
You swines! What did I ever do to you?

926
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:43,080
不要生氣  別放在心上啊
Sorry man. Don't take it personally.

927
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:44,580
怎么別放心上
I will.

928
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:46,940
查特·雷曼寧甘
Chatur Ramalingam

929
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:48,040
將永遠不會忘記這個侮辱
will never forget this insult.

930
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:52,540
我會每分每秒都記著這一刻的
I'll think of it every minute, every second of my life.

931
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:56,470
對不起  這只是給拉賈上了一課
Sorry man. That was a demo for Raju

932
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,200
不要盲目死記硬背啊
don't cram blindly.

933
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:00,740
要理解  享受科學的種種奇跡
Understand and enjoy the wonders of science.

934
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:03,370
我來這兒可不是為了享受科學的
I'm not here to enjoy science.

935
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:06,410
你是來這兒壓榨科學的
So you're here to screw science.

936
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:11,080
繼續啊  繼續嘲笑我的方式
Go ahead. Laugh at my methods.

937
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:16,490
總有一天我的方法會給我帶來成功的
But one day these methods will bring me success.

938
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:19,830
到那時  看誰笑到最后
That day I'll laugh and you'll cry.

939
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:25,490
你已誤入歧途  別追逐成功了
You're on the wrong track again. Don't chase success.

940
01:05:26,370 --> 01:05:28,580
好好當個工程師  成功會不請自來的
Become a good engineer and success will chase you.

941
01:05:28,790 --> 01:05:33,410
這些理想在現實世界里是行不通的
These ideals don't work in the real world.

942
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:38,240
你走你的陽關道  我過我的獨木橋
You take your train, I'll take mine.

943
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:42,330
十年后的今天  讓我們在此再會
Ten years from now we'll meet at the same station.

944
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:48,160
老時間  老地點  看看誰混得更有人樣
Same day. Same place. We'll see who's more successful.

945
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:50,870
是你...還是我
You...or I.

946
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:55,950
沒種了嗎  怕什么  來啊
Have the balls? C'mon, bet!

947
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:59,740
我們打賭
It's a challenge.

948
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:01,950
快看
Watch it!

949
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:09,490
他寫什么呢
What's he writing?

950
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,410
不要忘了這個日子
Don't forget this date.

951
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:30,290
太貴重了  我接受不了  蘇哈斯
I'm not used to such expensive gifts, Suhas.

952
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:31,870
你得適應啊  琵雅
Get used to them, Pia.

953
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,120
你要做蘇哈斯的嬌妻了
You're gonna be Suhas tandon's wife.

954
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:35,370
開票吧  伙計
Where's the bill, man?

955
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:40,740
稍等
I'll be back.

956
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,790
-你改了演講稿?  -什么
- You changed the speech? - What?

957
01:06:52,870 --> 01:06:53,740
別撒謊
Don't lie.

958
01:06:54,450 --> 01:06:56,330
恩...沒錯
Um...yeah.

959
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:58,320
你和我爸有什么深仇大恨
What's your problem with Dad?

960
01:06:58,320 --> 01:06:58,950
沒仇沒恨
I have no problem.

961
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:01,500
我在發明一臺以他名字命名的換流器
I'm making an inverter named after him.

962
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:02,240
看...
Look...oh

963
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:08,080
你為什么總找他麻煩
Why're you harassing him?

964
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:10,370
因為他是在辦工廠  不是學校
'cause he runs a factory, not a college.

965
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:14,330
批量培養混蛋  就像那樣
Churning out asses. Like that one.

966
01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:20,490
他親手毀了學校
He destroyed it, man.

967
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:25,120
你竟敢叫他混蛋
How dare you call him an ass?

968
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:28,620
他就是  先當工程師  然后讀MBA
He is one! First engineering, then MBA.

969
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:30,540
去美國的銀行工作
Then becomes a banker in the USA.

970
01:07:31,450 --> 01:07:33,950
就因為這樣賺的錢更多嗎
Because it rakes in more money?

971
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,740
對他來說  生活就是一張盈虧表
Life for him is just a profit-loss statement.

972
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,990
他看到了你身上的價值  就利用你
He sees profit in you, so he's with you.

973
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:41,710
校長千金  又是個醫生...
Director's daughter, doctor in the making...

974
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:42,990
為自己打造形象
good for his image!

975
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:44,580
他在乎的不是你
It's not you he cares for

976
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:48,200
你以為自己是誰啊
Who do you think you are?

977
01:07:48,450 --> 01:07:50,120
你說他不在乎我是什么意思
What do you mean he doesn't care for me?

978
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:54,040
新表?  等一下
New watch? One moment.

979
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:57,330
你總喜歡看我演示一下
You always need a demo.

980
01:07:58,370 --> 01:07:59,200
蘇哈斯
Hey Suhas.

981
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:02,950
你們干嗎呢
Where were you?

982
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:05,040
她找她的新表呢
She's looking for her watch.

983
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:06,990
什么  你弄丟了那塊表?
What? You lost the watch?

984
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:08,410
沒事  再買一塊就行了
Never mind. Get another.

985
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:09,990
那要40萬呢
It cost 400,000!

986
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,990
我的表只有250塊  走得一樣準
Mine's just 250, but keeps the same time.

987
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:14,740
閉嘴...
Keep quiet...

988
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:16,490
你怎么能這么不小心呢  琵雅
How could you be so careless, Pia?

989
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:19,190
你這種滿不在乎的態度真是太糟了
This callous attitude is disgusting.

990
01:08:19,190 --> 01:08:19,790
太無禮了
It's disrespectful.

991
01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:22,490
那是一塊限量版的表
That was a limited edition watch.

992
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:26,330
好吧  戴著你那塊古董垃圾去吃晚餐吧
Now wear your ancient piece of junk at dinner.

993
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:29,080
你看什么看
What're you staring at?

994
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,790
要準備來哭的了  成熟一點  琵雅
Here come the tears! Real mature, Pia.

995
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:36,580
我受不了這個
I can't handle this.

996
01:08:37,410 --> 01:08:39,540
別哭了  好好找找
Stop crying and look for it.

997
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,950
這表  另找他人來戴吧  混蛋
Find another wrist for this watch...ass!

998
01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:05,040
你太帥了  當面罵他混蛋啊
Hey, you're awesome. Called him an ass to his face.

999
01:09:05,290 --> 01:09:06,160
滾開
Get lost.

1000
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:08,120
這兒太吵了
It's too noisy here.

1001
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:10,370
她該說"謝謝"  我聽的卻是"滾開"
She's saying 'thank you', I hear 'get lost'.

1002
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:13,370
-我說"滾開"  -別搞得這么難堪嘛
- I said 'get lost'.  - Don't get so uptight

1003
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:16,490
事實上  你從來就沒有真的愛上過他
Actuaily, you never really loved him.

1004
01:09:16,910 --> 01:09:17,790
你什么意思
What do you mean?

1005
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:22,950
當你看著他時  風兒悄悄把故事傳送?
When you see him, do the winds whisper a melody?

1006
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,120
你的頭巾緩緩飛舞?
Your scarf flies in slow motion?

1007
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,870
明月當頭?
The moon appears gigantic?

1008
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:31,950
這是電影里的情節  不是現實生活
That happens in movies, not in life.

1009
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,530
生活中也會出現的
Happens in life too。

1010
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:35,120
當你真的愛一個人的時候
If you love a person,

1011
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:36,540
而不是一個混蛋
not an ass.

1012
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:46,580
喂?  怎么了
Hello. What?

1013
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:51,160
天哪  好的  我馬上來
Oh God! Ok, I'm on my way.

1014
01:09:54,370 --> 01:09:56,290
你是學醫的  對嗎  需要你的幫助
You're a medicai student, right? Need your help.

1015
01:09:56,370 --> 01:09:58,080
-緊急情況  拜托了  -什么事
- It's an emergency, please.  - What?

1016
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:01,790
請先跟我來  你們醫生的誓言怎么說的
Please come with me. What's that oath you doctors take.

1017
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,660
你們絕不拒絕病人的求援  真夠虛偽的
You'll never deny a patient help...the hippocratic oath.

1018
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:07,160
請幫幫我  情況緊急
Please help me, it's an emergency.

1019
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:14,830
你先是來我姐姐婚禮上吃霸王餐  然后又攪亂了我的訂婚
You gatecrash my sister's wedding, break off my engagement.

1020
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,580
因為你  爸爸不得不吃藥
My Dad is popping bp pills because of you.

1021
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,660
我還得在這兒幫你
And here I am, helping you!

1022
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:21,990
真是難以置信
Unbelievable!

1023
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:27,040
虛偽的誓詞  真是害慘我們了
This hippocratic oath -- it's really done us in!

1024
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:33,790
-拉賈在哪兒  -去找出租車了
- Where's Raju, Ma'am?  - Gone to get a cab.

1025
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:35,660
2個小時前就找急救車了
Called the ambuiance two hours ago.

1026
01:10:35,950 --> 01:10:38,540
在咱們國家  披薩都要送半小時
In this country, pizza reaches in 30 minutes

1027
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:39,660
更何況是救護車啊
but an ambulance!

1028
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:42,200
他需要趕緊住院治療  情況緊急
He needs hospitalization. Urgently.

1029
01:10:56,330 --> 01:10:57,370
停車
Hey stop!

1030
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:01,910
閃開  緊急情況
Move, it's an emergency!

1031
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:07,700
閃開  閃開
Move...move...

1032
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:13,910
醫生  這里有緊急情況
Doctor, emergency!

1033
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:16,410
有病人
That's the patient

1034
01:11:22,370 --> 01:11:24,450
拿著  拉賈來了
Keep this. Hey, here's Raju.

1035
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:26,870
怎么回事  你們開著摩托車送爸爸來的?
What the hell! You brought Dad on the scooter?

1036
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:30,080
我應該打包送快遞公司嗎
Should I've sent him by courier?

1037
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:33,290
別在要命的關頭開玩笑  他人呢
No wisecracks on dads profession! Where is he?

1038
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:35,700
去問問醫生吧
Go ask the doctor.

1039
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:38,290
琵雅  真是千鈞一發啊
Close call, Pia.

1040
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:39,910
再晚一點  就回天乏術了
A little delay, we'd have lost him.

1041
01:11:40,290 --> 01:11:41,310
幸好你們用摩托車送他過來
Glad you didn't wait for an ambuiance

1042
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:41,830
而不是等救護車

1043
01:11:41,950 --> 01:11:44,740
有問題盡管找我

1044
01:11:53,870 --> 01:11:56,870
蘭柯  謝謝你

消音器沒教你做人的規矩嗎
Silencer isn' teaching you manners?

1047
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:05,950
他沒告訴你  朋友是人最棒的咪咪嗎
Didn't he teach you -- a friend is man's greatest bosom?

1048
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:10,660
走吧  明天有考試的
Go on now. You have an exam tomorrow.

1049
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:14,490
考試多著呢  爸爸卻只有一個
Exams we have many, Dad mostly just one.

1050
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:18,450
我們不會撇下郵政局長先走的
We won't budge from here without the postmaster.

1051
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:20,040
別擔心了
Don't worry.

1052
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:31,240
蘭柯  原諒我吧  我那時是害怕了

1053
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,620
沒事了  好了

請原諒我

It's ok, calm down. Go see your Dad.

1056
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:50,870
別帶著一臉淚水去看他
And don't go with that weepy face.

1057
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:58,160
謝謝你  兄弟
Thanks buddy.

1058
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:14,540
摩托車真方便  救了一條命  多少錢買的
Natty scooter. Saved a life. How much does it cost?

1059
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:17,160
灑點薄荷醬上去  我就告訴你
Pour some mint sauce on it. It'll tell you.

1060
01:13:19,790 --> 01:13:21,700
獨立日快樂

今天不是獨立日
Today isn't independence day.

1062
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,010
對你來說就是
For you it is!

1063
01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:27,160
從今以后你就可以隨心所欲戴你媽的表了
Now you're free to wear your Mom's watch.

1064
01:13:27,790 --> 01:13:30,540
沒人再敢說它是塊古董垃圾了
No ass can say it's an ancient piece of junk.

1065
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:37,660
你怎么知道那是我媽媽的表
How do you know it was Mom's watch?

1066
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:41,870
在你姐姐的婚禮上  你穿著閃閃的新衣
At your sister's wedding, you wore sparkling new clothes.

1067
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:43,870
唯獨表是舊的
Only the watch was old.

1068
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:45,410
怎講
What could that mean?

1069
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:50,870
那天  你格外思念媽媽  不是嗎
You really missed your Mom that day, didn't you?

1070
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:54,740
是啊
Yes.

1071
01:13:55,790 --> 01:13:57,540
你媽媽肯定非常美麗
Your Mom must've been really beautiful.

1072
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,240
對啊  你怎么知道

1073
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:03,490
看到你爸爸了嗎
Seen your Dad?

1074
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,700
"人生是場競賽  要是你不跑"
'life is a race. If you don't run fast.

1075
01:14:06,870 --> 01:14:08,490
"就只有死的份兒...布谷鳥"
You'll be a broken egg...cuckoo bird'

1076
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:09,870
你...
You...

1077
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:19,790
微風低語  輕送旋律
The winds whisper a melody

1078
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:26,740
天空也跟著哼唱
The sky hums along

1079
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:34,240
時間歌唱
Time itself is singing

1080
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,660
我愚笨的心兒
My silly heart goes

1081
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:55,790
七上八下啊
as it jives and jigs along

1082
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:04,330
我愚笨的心兒
My silly heart goes

1083
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:06,490
七上八下啊

1084
01:15:06,830 --> 01:15:11,910
樹葉在枝上輕唱  蜜蜂群舞花心
Leaves sing on their branches bees jam with flowers

1085
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:14,890
陽光在花瓣上歡舞
Crazy sunbeams dance off petals

1086
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:17,040
小鳥在天空里歡歌
as birds yodel in the skies

1087
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:22,540
花兒啊  大膽而無所顧忌的相擁
Flowers, bold and brazen snuggle

1088
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,580
這電影的場景在你我之間上演
I've seen it happen in movies what's now happening with us

1089
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:36,260
我那愚笨的心兒
My silly heart goes

1090
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:38,410
七上八下啊

七上八下啊
as it jives and jigs along

1093

讓我們制作獨特而又永?琲瑭〃?醬吧
Let's make the unique and ever useful mint sauce

1094
01:15:56,160 --> 01:16:01,540

The all-powerful sauce that exposes phony people

1095
01:16:02,450 --> 01:16:04,790
你的第七間屋子已打掃干凈
Your 7th house is clear

1096
01:16:05,290 --> 01:16:07,450
躲過混蛋  你定遇得到好人
Shunning an ass, you'll fall for a human

1097
01:16:07,950 --> 01:16:09,660
時機已到  戀愛吧

新德里的氣溫保持穩定

天氣晴朗
Clear skies.

1100
01:16:17,670 --> 01:16:20,870
但是對于戀愛的人來說  下雨才好呢
But if in love, expect rain

1101
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:31,120
雨滴淅淅瀝瀝隨風飛舞
Pitter-patter go the raindrops whish-whoosh whistles the wind

1102
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:36,660
如同華爾茲  在天地間回蕩
Do-da-dee waltzes the rain boom-boom echoes the sky

1103
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:38,880
讓大雨濕透你的全身
Drenched in rain and

1104
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:42,040
點燃你的熱情  隨著音樂晃動你的臀部

1110
01:17:30,370 --> 01:17:33,260
那低沉的月  那么迷人
The gorgeous low moon

1111
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:35,040
為地球唱響小夜曲

1112
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:40,620
流星劃過  低吟一曲愛的民謠
A shooting star skips along crooning a ballad of love

1113

It's 8.30, your exam is at 9.

1124
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:45,330
可我們不能把他一個人留在這兒啊
But we can't leave him alone.

1125
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:48,450
有我在  不就3個小時嘛
I'm here. It's a matter of three hours.

1126
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:51,200
騎我的摩托車去吧  要遲到了
Take my scooter. It's getting late.

1127
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:58,450
天哪  真是塊古董表
Gosh, what an ancient watch.

1128

老師  他們還在寫呢

好了  時間到

是有緊急情況

1135
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:51,490
他盯著我們好像我們要了他的腎一樣
He glared at us like we'd asked for both his kidneys.

1136
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:53,870
我們繼續寫
But we continued writing.

1137
01:19:54,830 --> 01:19:57,870
他則接著整理卷子
He continued arranging the answer sheets.

1138
01:20:06,370 --> 01:20:07,290
好了  老師

老師  拜托了

1142
01:20:19,330 --> 01:20:21,160
首相的兒子嗎  就算是...

1143
01:20:21,450 --> 01:20:23,540
我也不會收你們的卷子的

1144
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:27,040
你知道我們的名字和學號嗎

不知道

01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:32,330
你們是誰
Who are you?

1147
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:34,410
他不知道哈  快跑

你們的學號是啥

你們的卷子哪兒去了

1150
01:20:47,950 --> 01:20:49,790
神啊  行行好吧

1151
01:20:49,870 --> 01:20:52,890
今天就是出分數的日子

1152

讓我們和神靈來個交易吧
Time to make a deal with God.

1153
01:20:55,790 --> 01:20:58,290
讓我的電子課學過了吧  我愿敬獻椰肉
Just save my electronics. I'll offer a coconut.

1154
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:01,630
神蛇先生  保佑我的物理成績吧
Sir snake, biess my physics.

1155
01:21:01,630 --> 01:21:03,660
我保證每天敬獻一品脫牛奶
I promise a pint of milk per day.

1156
01:21:03,870 --> 01:21:07,290
神牛啊  保我通過吧  請吃這鮮草
O mother cow, heip me pass...have this grass.

1157
01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:10,870
不再有關于姑娘的淫蕩想法
No x-rated thoughts of girls in my class.

1158
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:12,620
關照一下我的成績吧

1159
01:21:12,830 --> 01:21:16,700
財神  我愿每個月敬獻100塊
God of wealth, I'll offer 100 every month.

1160
01:21:16,910 --> 01:21:19,540
100塊還不夠賄賂交警呢
100 won't bribe even a traffic cop,

1161
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:22,080
更別說圣賢了
let alone the almighty.

1162
01:21:23,290 --> 01:21:25,370
從心底告白
Check from the bottom

1163
01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:28,490
你是最后一名

倒數第二

沒他
Not there.

1168
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:45,200
我心一沉
My heart sank.

1169
01:21:45,790 --> 01:21:48,260
不是因為我們的糟糕成績啊
Not 'cause our ranks tanked,

1170
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:50,200
是因為我們的朋友不及格
but 'cause our friend flunked.

1171
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:56,370
肯定有問題  這不可能  不公平
There's a mistake. It's not possibie. It's injustice.

1172
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:03,410
消音器為什么哭啊

1173

1175
01:22:09,580 --> 01:22:10,700
蘭柯
Rancho.

1176
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:14,450
蘭柯?
Rancho?

1177
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:17,740
讓開點
Move aside.

1178
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:28,430
朋友不濟  你難過
Your friend fails, you feel bad.

1179
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:30,990
朋友發達  你更難過

1180
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:36,120
真傷心  另外兩個更傷心

1181
01:22:37,370 --> 01:22:41,240

薩赫利·拉奧  三排...
Sahili Rao. Third row...

1185
01:22:52,950 --> 01:22:55,410
校長  為什么根據名次排座位啊
Sir, why this seating according to rank?

1186
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:57,830
不行嗎
Any problem with that?

1187
01:22:57,950 --> 01:23:02,080
不是  這個排名制度跟社會等級制度似的
Yes, this grading system is like a caste system.

1188
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:05,700
好像奴隸一樣
Slaves.

1189
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,290
-這不太好  校長  -你有更好的建議嗎
- It's not nice, sir. - You have a better idea?

1190
01:23:09,870 --> 01:23:14,040
有  成績根本就不應該公開
Yes. Results should not be displayed at all.

1191
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:18,580
為何要公開別人的隱私呢
Why publicise someone's flaws?

1192
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:23,910
如果你缺鐵  醫生是給你開補藥
If your iron count is low, will the doctor prescribe tonic...

1193
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:25,490
還會在電視上廣播你的病例嗎
or air your report on TV?

1194
01:23:26,330 --> 01:23:27,410
明白嗎  校長
You see, sir?

1195
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,790
這么說來  你的意思是
So basically, what you are saying is

1196
01:23:30,290 --> 01:23:32,080
我得親自去每個同學的房間
I should personally go to each student's room.

1197
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,200
然后對著他們的耳朵悄悄地說
And whisper in his ears...

1198
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:37,660
你是第一名  你是第二名
'you have come first'; 'you're second';

1199
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:39,330
不好意思  你沒及格
'I'm so sorry, you have failed'

1200
01:23:42,330 --> 01:23:46,700
不是這樣  校長  我是說分數劃分等級
No sir, I mean grades create a divide

1201
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:50,990
我是第一名  所以坐在你旁邊
I've topped, so I'm next to you.

1202
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:53,660
我朋友排名在后  就坐在后面的角落
My pais came last, they're in the back corner.

1203
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:55,370
至少他們還能坐在角落里
At least they're in the corner

1204
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,910
再跟你混下去  他們連角落都別想坐
More time with you, and they'll be out of the photo.

1205
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:01,040
他們都會不及格  找不到工作
They will neither pass, nor get a job

1206
01:24:01,830 --> 01:24:05,700
他們會找到工作的  校長  肯定有公司會...
They'll get jobs, sir. There must be some firm that...

1207
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:07,990
喜歡人類而不是機器
prefers humans to machines.

1208
01:24:09,870 --> 01:24:11,700
會找到工作的  我保證
They'll get jobs. I guarantee.

1209
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:16,040
你保證?
You guarantee it!

1210
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:17,790
打賭嗎  校長
Bet, sir?

1211
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:22,490
-戈爾文  -什么事  校長
- Govind. - Yes, sir?

1212
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:29,950
假如他們有人能在校園招聘會上找到工作...
Even if one of them gets a job in campus interviews...

1213
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:32,370
就刮掉我的胡子
Shave off my moustache.

1214
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:35,990
校長
Sir!

1215
01:24:36,290 --> 01:24:39,330
-滿意了嗎  -笑一個
- Happy? - Smile, please

1216
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:41,580
滿意了  校長
Happy, sir.

1217
01:24:45,950 --> 01:24:49,540
混蛋  按喇叭來掩蓋你的屁聲
Jackass! Honking to hide your tooting.

1218
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:52,790
好像腐爛的味道  你又吃放屁藥啦?
Septic tank! Popping pills again?

1219
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:55,700
不是我  是拉賈放的
I didn't do it. Raju?

1220
01:24:55,910 --> 01:24:57,540
好熟悉的臭味啊
This is a familiar stink.

1221
01:24:57,620 --> 01:25:00,000
他是全球變暖的始作俑者
He's the sole cause for global warming.

1222
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:00,600
我受不了了
I cannot take it.

1223
01:25:25,910 --> 01:25:28,540
錢包給我  我去買條褲子
Toss me your wailet. I'll buy pants.

1224
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:33,290
-穿查特的衣服吧  -別碰我衣服
- Take Chatur's suit instead. - Don't touch my suit.

1225
01:25:34,450 --> 01:25:36,240
就算你只穿內褲  蘭柯也認得出你
Rancho'll recognize you even in underwear.

1226
01:25:36,410 --> 01:25:40,410
-這地方在哪兒  -我識字的話  還會賣花生嗎
- Where's this? - if I could read, wouid I sell peanuts?

1227
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:43,200
他不識字  但是會說話吧
He can't read, but he can speak.

1228
01:25:43,410 --> 01:25:47,410
等下  你認識一個叫蘭柯霍達斯·昌恰德的人嗎
Wait. Do you know a Ranchhoddas Chanchad?

1229
01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:49,370
認識  他住那邊
Yes, he lives there.

1230
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:55,370
他如風隨行
Free as the wind was he.

1231
01:25:57,370 --> 01:26:02,790
像疾飛的風箏
Like a soaring kite was he

1232
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:06,740
去向何方
Where did he go?

1233
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:09,200
找找他吧
Let's find him.

1234
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:11,990
-查特  你的藥  -謝謝  哪兒找到的
- Chatur, your pills. - Thanks. Where were they?

1235
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:14,580
-口袋里  -我的褲子
- In the pocket. - My pants!

1236
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:16,700
馬克思說過  資源要共享
Karl Marx says to share all resources.

1237
01:26:18,290 --> 01:26:20,240
你這樣別人會誤會的
You'll give people ideas.

1238
01:26:21,790 --> 01:26:22,830
我現在就想要
I want it now.

1239
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,200
怎么了
What happened?

1240
01:26:41,330 --> 01:26:42,540
蘭柯的父親
Rancho's father.

1241
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:48,790
請問  蘭柯霍達斯在哪兒
Excuse me, Where is Ranchhoddas?

1242
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:52,040
-在那兒  -謝謝
- There he is. - Thank you.

1243
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:18,370
-蘭柯  -什么事
- Rancho. - Yes?

1244
01:27:18,950 --> 01:27:22,660
不好意思  我們找蘭柯霍達斯
Sorry. We're looking for Ranchhoddas.

1245
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:24,990
我就是蘭柯霍達斯
I am Ranchhoddas.

1246
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:29,490
不是  我們找蘭柯霍達斯·沙瑪達斯·昌恰德
No, I mean 'Ranchhoddas Shamaidas Chanchad'.

1247
01:27:30,910 --> 01:27:33,490
蘭柯霍達斯·沙瑪達斯·昌恰德  就是我啊
Ranchhoddas Shamaidas Chanchad. That's me.

1248
01:27:38,950 --> 01:27:41,240
蘭柯霍達斯  節哀  孩子
Ranchhoddas, take care, son.

1249
01:28:00,540 --> 01:28:02,660
蘭柯霍達斯·昌恰德
'Ranchhoddas Chanchad'

1250
01:28:09,830 --> 01:28:10,870
拉賈

1251
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:37,900
我穿著內褲橫穿新德里到了西姆拉
I'll be in the Guinness book for

1252
01:28:37,910 --> 01:28:39,740
都能破吉尼斯了
driving Delhi-Shimla in underwear.

1253
01:28:39,870 --> 01:28:40,990
而且還找錯了人
That too, for the wrong guy!

1254
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:45,450
同名  同學歷  同照片  就是不同人
Same name, same degree, same photo, but a different guy.

1255
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:47,490
怎么回事啊
What's going on?

1256
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,870
S消音器怎么找到蘭柯地址的
How did silencer get Rancho's address?

1257
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:52,910
說的對
Good point!

1258
01:28:54,330 --> 01:28:55,740
查特  過來
Chatur, come here.

1259
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:05,540
你敢打開這個  我從舊金山帶來的
How dare you open this? I got this from San Francisco.

1260
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:07,120
手工餅干
Handmade biscuits.

1261
01:29:08,950 --> 01:29:11,200
特意為范素科·旺都先生準備的
Specially for Mr. Phunsukh Wangdu.

1262
01:29:11,450 --> 01:29:13,620
范素科·班都?  誰啊
Phunsukh Bangdu? Who's that?

1263
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:18,330
不是班都  是旺都  范素科·旺都
Not Bangdu. Wangdu. 'w'. Phunsukh Wangdu.

1264
01:29:18,410 --> 01:29:21,240
你知道他是誰嗎  他是個偉大的科學家
Do you know who that is? He's a great scientist.

1265
01:29:21,330 --> 01:29:24,040
400項專利  誰都想得到他
400 patents. The world wants him.

1266
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:28,540
花了我一年的時間才能跟他見面
Took me a year to get an appointment.

1267
01:29:29,290 --> 01:29:34,740
只要他跟我的公司簽合同  我就發達了
Once he signs the deal with my company, I'll be huge!

1268
01:29:34,830 --> 01:29:38,990
別想旺都了  你怎么找到蘭柯地址的
Forget Wangdu. How'd you get Rancho's address?

1269
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:41,080
這得感謝范素科·旺都
You should be thanking Phunsukh Wangdu.

1270
01:29:41,450 --> 01:29:45,040
他告訴我的  看
He led me to Rancho, see this.

1271
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:51,660
我秘書到這里跟旺都預約
My secretary was here to fix an appointment with Wangdu.

1272
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:56,080
她沒預約到  但是我找到了蘭柯
She didn't get the appointment. But I found Rancho.

1273
01:29:56,200 --> 01:30:01,830
我查了西姆拉的電話簿  發現了蘭柯的名字
I checked the Shimla directory and found Rancho's name.

1274
01:30:01,870 --> 01:30:03,540
他的臉怎么了
What happened to his face?

1275
01:30:03,910 --> 01:30:06,240
難道是易容術  以表示與你見面的榮幸?
Plastic surgery in honor of your visit?

1276
01:30:10,620 --> 01:30:12,450
只有一個人知道真相
Only one man has the answer.

1277
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:17,700
對不起  爸爸  我無法滿足你最后的心愿
Sorry Papa, I couidn't fulfill your last wish.

1278
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:22,950
你一直讓我帶你去朝圣
You kept asking me to take you on pilgrimage.

1279
01:30:23,870 --> 01:30:26,370
我卻等著公路的投標
But I waited for the highway tender.

1280
01:30:27,870 --> 01:30:32,330
現在投標好了  你卻閉眼了
There the tender opened, here you closed your eyes.

1281
01:30:36,410 --> 01:30:40,910
真對不起  爸爸  我是個不孝之子
I am so sorry, papa. I could not be a good son.

1282
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:42,410
不對
Wrong.

1283
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:45,700
你是工程師  你的學位在?暀W呢
You're an engineer. Your degree's on the wall!

1284
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,290
你是個很孝順的兒子
You were a very good son.

1285
01:30:49,910 --> 01:30:54,660
你怎么敢闖進來  我要報警抓你們
How dare you barge in? I'll have you arrested.

1286
01:30:54,830 --> 01:30:58,040
不  你會被抓起來的  我們查過了
No, you'll be arrested. We've made enquiries.

1287
01:30:58,330 --> 01:31:01,410
你靠學位來簽訂合約
You use the degree to clinch contracts.

1288
01:31:01,870 --> 01:31:05,120
那是我朋友的學位  你怎么弄來的
It's our friend's degree. How did you get it?

1289
01:31:20,700 --> 01:31:22,120
這是150英畝的土地
This is a 150 acre estate.

1290
01:31:22,540 --> 01:31:25,740
就算我斃了你  埋掉  也不會有人知道的
If I shoot and bury you, no one would even notice.

1291
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:26,990
明白了嗎
Get the point?

1292
01:31:28,330 --> 01:31:29,200
給我滾出去
Now get lost.

1293
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:37,580
我正要帶著父親的骨灰去圣河
I'm taking papa's ashes to the sacred river.

1294
01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:39,080
也可以帶上你們的
Can take yours too.

1295
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:48,120
快搶他爹
Grab papa!

1296
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,160
這兒  這兒
Here, here.

1297
01:31:56,290 --> 01:31:57,330
放了我爸爸
Let go of papa!

1298
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:03,080
說實話  要不就把你爸爸沖走
Tell the truth or papa is flushed!

1299
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:06,120
-還我爸爸  -爸爸要去圣下水道了
- Hand over papa. - Papa goes to the sacred sewer.

1300
01:32:06,830 --> 01:32:08,570
把我爸從馬桶上挪開
Get papa out of the potty.

1301
01:32:08,570 --> 01:32:10,160
你開槍  我就沖了他
You pull trigger, I pull flush.

1302
01:32:10,290 --> 01:32:11,620
數到3
I'll count to three

1303
01:32:11,660 --> 01:32:15,410
想殺我們?  拉賈  把骨灰撒進去
Wanna shoot us? Raju, scatter the ashes

1304
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:19,080
1
One.

1305
01:32:19,250 --> 01:32:23,990
要抓我們  爸爸就進排水管了
Take us down, and papa's down the drain

1306
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:26,160
2
Two.

1307
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:28,700
讓他在下水管中暢游吧
Then grope for him in the gutter.

1308
01:32:28,830 --> 01:32:29,700
怎么了  拉賈
What is it, Raju?

1309
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:33,620
我們拿錯壺了  這是空的
We've got the wrong urn. It's empty!

1310
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:35,410
空的?
Empty?

1311
01:32:36,790 --> 01:32:40,240
-空的  -我們把它倒掉
- Empty. - We'll empty it out!

1312
01:32:40,370 --> 01:32:41,240
不  不
No, no!

1313
01:32:41,330 --> 01:32:44,200
我們倒了啊
We'll empty it out.

1314
01:32:44,290 --> 01:32:46,740
不  我投降
No. Hands up!

1315
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:52,080
你是誰
Who are you?

1316
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:53,370
我是蘭柯
I am Rancho.

1317
01:32:54,660 --> 01:32:57,120
以我爸爸的名義發誓  這是真的
I swear on papa, it's true.

1318
01:32:57,330 --> 01:32:59,120
我是蘭柯  他是徹侯特
I am Rancho! That was Chhote.

1319
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:01,080
徹侯特?
Chhote?

1320
01:33:02,450 --> 01:33:07,450
他是我家花匠的兒子  徹侯特
He was our gardener's son, Chhote.

1321
01:33:09,410 --> 01:33:12,240
他父母去世后  跟我們住一起
He stayed on with us after he was orphaned.

1322
01:33:14,450 --> 01:33:22,290
在周圍打些零工  跑跑腿
Did odd jobs around the house, ran errands.

1323
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:24,990
他對學習充滿熱情
He had a passion for learning.

1324
01:33:28,250 --> 01:33:30,910
穿著我的舊校服  溜進學校
He'd wear my old uniform and slip into school.

1325
01:33:32,910 --> 01:33:35,870
聽他喜歡的課程  這正合我意
And attend any class he liked. It suited me.

1326
01:33:36,830 --> 01:33:42,910
我讓他幫我做作業  幫我考試
I made him do my homework, take my exams.

1327
01:33:43,410 --> 01:33:46,450
一切都很順利  直到有一天
It was going well, till one day.

1328
01:33:46,870 --> 01:33:51,450
老師看到一個六年級的學生做高一的數學題
Our teacher saw a sixth grader doing tenth grade math.

1329
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:53,040
你幾年級  孩子
Which grade are you in, son?

1330
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:55,450
你叫什么
What's your name?

1331
01:33:56,410 --> 01:33:57,370
我們被抓了
We got caught.

1332
01:33:58,540 --> 01:33:59,910
我爸爸很有權勢  所以...
Papa was a powerful man, so...

1333
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:03,540
在去見校長之前  我們老師提醒他
Our teacher alerted him before going to the principal.

1334
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:07,990
既然你選擇了  就要有始有終
You started it, you will finish it.

1335
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:13,490
人們表面很尊敬我
People pretend to show me respect.

1336
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:16,410
但是在背后
But behind my back...

1337
01:34:17,370 --> 01:34:18,990
丫們卻嘲笑我是文盲
mock me as an illiterate.

1338
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,040
我不會讓此事發生在我兒子身上
I won't let that happen to my son.

1339
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:27,450
這個孩子想學習  而我只想要個學歷
This boy wants to study. I want just a degree.

1340
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,950
就將錯就錯吧
Let the game go on.

1341
01:34:30,950 --> 01:34:32,580
讓這孩子做個工程師
Make this kid an engineer.

1342
01:34:33,830 --> 01:34:39,200
而我將會在?暀W掛著我兒子的學歷證書
And I'll have a degree in my son's name on that wall.

1343
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:43,540
我去倫敦待了4年  他則替我上大學
I went to London for four years, he went to college as me.

1344
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:51,370
他答應獲得學位后斷絕一切聯系
He'd promised to cut contact with all after getting the degree.

1345
01:34:53,500 --> 01:35:01,740
但是他總說  有兩個白癡會來找我
But he always said, 'two idiots will come looking for me'.

1346
01:35:06,700 --> 01:35:08,370
他真的很想你們倆
He really misses you both.

1347
01:35:10,790 --> 01:35:14,740
我給你們他的地址  去找他吧
I'll give you his address, go to him.

1348
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:21,580
請幫我保守秘密
But please keep my secret.

1349
01:35:23,450 --> 01:35:24,620
什么秘密
What secret?

1350
01:35:37,950 --> 01:35:41,450
你拿錯罐子了  先生  爸爸在這兒呢
You got the wrong urn, sir. Papa is in here.

1351
01:35:43,660 --> 01:35:46,240
到底怎么回事  那個拿槍的家伙是誰
What the hell's going on? Who was that gun guy?

1352
01:35:46,290 --> 01:35:49,830
故事復雜  又沒字幕  不適合你
Complicated story. Without subtitles. Not for you.

1353
01:35:49,870 --> 01:35:52,160
-別想了  -我們去哪兒
- Ignore it. - Where're we going?

1354
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:54,410
拉達克
Ladakh.

1355
01:35:54,450 --> 01:35:55,830
拉達克?  為什么
Ladakh! Why?

1356
01:35:56,540 --> 01:35:57,490
去見蘭柯
To meet Rancho.

1357
01:35:57,660 --> 01:36:00,660
他在拉達克做什么
What's he doing in Ladakh?

1358
01:36:00,700 --> 01:36:04,290
不知道  我們有個學校地址
No clue. We have the address of a school.

1359
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:07,620
學校老師
School teacher!

1360
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:11,910
我是羅克利奇公司的副總裁  而他...
I'm vice president of Rockledge Corporation, and he...

1361
01:36:12,330 --> 01:36:14,620
蘋果的果  氣球的球... [諷刺蘭柯教書育人]
A for apple, b for Ball...

1362
01:36:14,790 --> 01:36:15,990
蠢驢的驢
D for donkey.

1363
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:21,660
下周我要和范素科·旺都簽一個大合同
Next week I sign a huge deal with Phunsukh Wangdu

1364
01:36:21,830 --> 01:36:24,870
而他...蘋果的果  氣球的球...
And he...A for apple, B for Ball...

1365
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:30,990
我對那個傻瓜的敬意從今天起急速提升
Today my respect for that idiot shot up.

1366
01:36:31,910 --> 01:36:34,240
大多數人上大學只想得個學位
Most of us went to college just for a degree.

1367
01:36:34,830 --> 01:36:39,040
沒學位就沒稱心的工作  沒有嬌妻
No degree meant no plum job, no pretty wife...

1368
01:36:39,330 --> 01:36:41,910
沒有信用卡  沒有社會地位
No credit card, no social status.

1369
01:36:42,580 --> 01:36:44,410
這些對他都不重要
None of this mattered to him.

1370
01:36:44,540 --> 01:36:46,370
他在大學享受學習的樂趣
He was in college for the joy of learning.

1371
01:36:46,870 --> 01:36:50,160
從不關心是第一名還是最后一名
He never cared if he was first or last.

1372
01:36:50,750 --> 01:36:53,080
誰是登月的第一人
Who was the first man on the moon?

1373
01:36:53,330 --> 01:36:54,580
是尼爾·阿姆斯特朗  校長
Neil Armstrong, sir.

1374
01:36:54,620 --> 01:36:56,790
顯然  是尼爾·阿姆斯特朗  我們都知道
Obviously, it is Neil Armstrong. We all know it.

1375
01:36:56,950 --> 01:36:58,200
誰是第二個呢
Who was the second?

1376
01:36:58,700 --> 01:37:00,330
不要浪費時間  這并不重要
Don't waste your time. It's not important.

1377
01:37:00,790 --> 01:37:03,290
沒有人會記得第二名
Nobody remembers the man who ever came second.

1378
01:37:04,410 --> 01:37:09,870
不久  將會有26家公司前來招聘
Soon, 26 companies will be here with job offers.

1379
01:37:10,330 --> 01:37:15,990
你們在期末考試前甚至就可以找到工作
You'll have a job even before your final exam,

1380
01:37:16,750 --> 01:37:18,620
這也是最后一搏  朋友們
this is your last lap, my friends.

1381
01:37:18,950 --> 01:37:21,160
踩住油門  全速前進
Put the pedal to the metal. Step on the gas.

1382
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:23,240
整裝待發  創造歷史
Go out there and make history!

1383
01:37:26,660 --> 01:37:27,910
有疑問嗎
Any questions?

1384
01:37:30,410 --> 01:37:31,330
請講
Yes?

1385
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:36,290
校長  假如有個學生找到了工作...
Sir, suppose a student gets a job...

1386
01:37:36,660 --> 01:37:40,780
但是期末考試不及格
But narrowly fails the final exam,

1387
01:37:40,780 --> 01:37:43,950
他還能得到這份工作嗎
will he still have the job?

1388
01:37:44,450 --> 01:37:45,790
問得好
Very good question.

1389
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:51,410
誰有跟他相同的疑問嗎
Anyone else with the same question?

1390
01:37:53,330 --> 01:37:54,660
不出所料
As expected.

1391
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,120
請到臺上來  給他們點鼓勵
Please come on stage. Give them a big hand.

1392
01:38:11,290 --> 01:38:13,580
過去的4年里
For the last four years,

1393
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:16,580
他們是成績最穩定的同學
they've been our most consistent students.

1394
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:20,040
每次考試都很穩定地排在最后
Consistently last in every exam.

1395
01:38:20,870 --> 01:38:22,240
來  天才們  來
Come my geniuses, come.

1396
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:29,330
他們的腦袋會值很多錢
Their brains will fetch a handsome price.

1397
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:33,080
因為它們完全沒被用過
'cause they're completely unused.

1398
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:36,830
下面回答他們的問題
And to answer their question.

1399
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:40,540
成績不會影響工作
The exam won't affect their jobs.

1400
01:38:41,330 --> 01:38:44,870
因為根本不會有公司雇傭他們
Because no company will hire them anyway!

1401
01:38:45,700 --> 01:38:48,740
他們太特別了  他們的名字將用金字鐫刻
They're so unique, their names will be writen in gold.

1402
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:51,950
"法哈尼楚特"和"柏饒拉朱利"
'farhanitrate' and 'prerajulization'

1403
01:38:52,040 --> 01:38:53,540
請大家鼓勵鼓勵他們
Give them a big hand, please, everybody.

1404
01:39:02,620 --> 01:39:07,490
他羞辱我們
He screwed us!

1405
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:09,580
當著所有人的面
In front of everyone.

1406
01:39:10,700 --> 01:39:15,830
神靈啊  我愿從此食素  并點1000根香燭
God, I'll give up meat, light a 1000 incense sticks.

1407
01:39:15,910 --> 01:39:17,700
就請幫我一個忙
Do me just one favor.

1408
01:39:17,790 --> 01:39:20,240
滅了病毒那個老不死的
Delete virus!

1409
01:39:21,870 --> 01:39:23,870
把他燒死在地獄里
Burn him in hell.

1410
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:29,080
在沸油中炸了他
Fry virus-nuggets in bubbling oil.

1411
01:39:29,830 --> 01:39:32,700
你覺得神是簽了合約的殺手嗎
You think God is a contract killer?

1412
01:39:33,330 --> 01:39:34,620
你閉嘴
You shut up.

1413
01:39:35,330 --> 01:39:38,240
你每年都在照片的中間
You're in the center of the photo every year.

1414
01:39:38,290 --> 01:39:40,240
我們就爛在角落
We're rotting in the corner.

1415
01:39:41,290 --> 01:39:44,330
今年我們也許就不會出現在照片上了
This year we may fall out of the photo altogether.

1416
01:39:46,790 --> 01:39:48,620
-知道我為什么第一嗎  -為什么
- Know why I come first? - Why?

1417
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:50,740
因為我喜歡機器
Because I love machines.

1418
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:53,370
我對機器有熱情
Engineering is my passion.

1419
01:39:54,410 --> 01:39:55,660
知道你的熱情是什么嗎
Know your passion?

1420
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:00,200
-那是我的包  -閉嘴
- That's my bag. - Be quiet.

1421
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:02,490
你到底想干什么
What're you up to?

1422
01:40:04,910 --> 01:40:07,080
這...是你的熱情
This...is your passion.

1423
01:40:08,330 --> 01:40:09,740
去寄這封信
Go post this letter.

1424
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:11,450
什么信
What letter?

1425
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:16,690
五年前他寫給最喜愛的
5 years ago he wrote this for his favorite

1426
01:40:16,690 --> 01:40:18,450
野外攝影師的信
wildlife photographer.

1427
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:21,990
-安德烈  -伊斯塔萬
- Andre. - Istvan.

1428
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:26,580
特別想認識遠在匈牙利的他
He wanted to train with him in Hungary.

1429
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:30,830
但是因為怕他爸  那個希特勒  他從沒寄出去
But in fear of his Dad, the fuhrer, never posted it.

1430
01:40:32,540 --> 01:40:36,120
放棄工程學  投身攝影
Quit engineering, marry photography,

1431
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:39,080
發揮自己的才能
follow your talent.

1432
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:46,240
如果MJ的爸爸強迫他做拳擊手
If Michael Jackson's Dad forced him to be a boxer...

1433
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:50,580
拳王阿里的爸爸逼他做歌手
And Mohammad Ali's Dad pushed him to be a singer...

1434
01:40:51,290 --> 01:40:52,620
想想有多可怕
Imagine the disaster.

1435
01:40:54,660 --> 01:40:57,200
你明白了嗎
Do you get it?

1436
01:41:00,750 --> 01:41:04,080
白癡  喜歡攝影  卻屈身于機器
Idiot! Loves photography, but is marrying machines.

1437
01:41:08,700 --> 01:41:10,120
我尊敬的精神領袖蘭柯霍達斯
Your holiness guru Ranchhoddas.

1438
01:41:11,410 --> 01:41:15,580
工程學就是我的妻子和情人
Engineering is my wife and mistress both.

1439
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,540
但是我還是失敗了  為什么  請解釋
But I still fail. Why? Expiain.

1440
01:41:20,660 --> 01:41:23,040
因為你是個懦夫  懼怕未來
'cause you're a coward, scared of the future.

1441
01:41:24,750 --> 01:41:29,240
看這個  圣環比手指還多
Look at this. More holy rings than fingers.

1442
01:41:29,790 --> 01:41:32,990
一個恐懼一個環  考試  姐姐的嫁妝  工作
One ring per fear - exam, sis's dowry, job.

1443
01:41:34,450 --> 01:41:38,240
帶著這些對明天的恐懼  怎么活過今天
With such fear of tomorrow, how'll you live today?

1444
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:40,740
怎么能專注地學習
How'll you focus on studies?

1445
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:45,200
怪兄弟  一個活在恐懼中  一個活在偽裝中
Strange buddies! One lives in fear, the other in pretense.

1446
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:51,540
這兩個你都有  既恐懼又偽裝
You live in both - fear and pretense.

1447
01:41:51,750 --> 01:41:55,580
害怕告訴琵雅  你愛她
You're scared to tell Pia you love her...

1448
01:41:55,580 --> 01:41:57,830
所以假裝不愛
so you pretend you don't.

1449
01:42:00,330 --> 01:42:02,410
我擦  坑爹呢
What rubbish!

1450
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:07,120
講道理簡單  做起來就難了
Easy to offer free advice, tough to foliow it.

1451
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:10,450
有種嗎  去向琵雅表白
Have the guts? Go confess to Pia.

1452
01:42:10,910 --> 01:42:14,790
-根本不是一回事  -就是一回事  我的主啊
- There's no connection! - Deep connection, your holiness.

1453
01:42:14,870 --> 01:42:20,370
聽著  如果你敢表白
Listen, if you confess to Pia,

1454
01:42:20,790 --> 01:42:25,240
我就告訴我老爸  不學工程  改嫁攝影
I'll tell Dad - no engineering, I'm marrying photography.

1455
01:42:26,410 --> 01:42:30,080
那我就在招聘前  丟掉我的圣環
And I'll dump my rings before the job interview

1456
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:31,580
干不干
Deal?

1457
01:42:33,660 --> 01:42:35,450
有種嗎
Have the guts?

1458
01:42:35,580 --> 01:42:37,870
精神領袖無話可說了
His holiness is speechless.

1459
01:42:43,910 --> 01:42:44,790
走
Let's go.

1460
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:51,160
-跟我來  -去哪兒
- Follow me. - Where?

1461
01:42:56,790 --> 01:42:58,330
走
Let's go.

1462
01:42:58,750 --> 01:43:01,870
病毒  我是抗病毒啊
Virus! I'm anti-virus

1463
01:43:01,950 --> 01:43:03,450
希望這兒沒有狗
Hope no dog here.

1464
01:43:03,580 --> 01:43:05,990
懦夫  走啊
Cowards! Let's go.

1465
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:09,830
如果有危險  我會給出病毒警報的
If any danger, I'll give the virus alert.

1466
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:23,660
小心  病毒在里面
Beware - virus inside.

1467
01:43:44,250 --> 01:43:45,450
要背景音嗎
Need background score?

1468
01:43:45,660 --> 01:43:46,660
-琵雅  -誰啊
- Pia. - Who's it?

1469
01:43:49,410 --> 01:43:53,120
別喊  是我  蘭柯
Don't yell! It's me, Rancho.

1470
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:58,450
就一會兒  我說完就走
Just listen for a moment, then I'm gone.

1471
01:43:58,750 --> 01:44:01,160
什么也不用說...
Say not a word...

1472
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:02,490
-琵雅  -什么
- Pia. - Yes?

1473
01:44:04,620 --> 01:44:07,950
和你騎摩托的那22分鐘
Those 22 minutes with you on the scooter

1474
01:44:08,790 --> 01:44:13,370
是我一生中最開心的22分鐘
were the most enchanting 22 minutes of my life.

1475
01:44:17,790 --> 01:44:23,200
我愿意和你在摩托上共度一生
I could spend an eternity with you on the scooter.

1476
01:44:25,450 --> 01:44:28,580
...讓時間靜止
...and time stands still.

1477
01:44:29,620 --> 01:44:33,350
每晚你都會出現在我的夢中
Every night you ride into my dreams

1478
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:37,080
騎著摩托而來  裝扮得宛如新娘
on your scooter, dressed as a bride.

1479
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:42,370
取下的不是面紗  卻是頭盔
Instead of a veil, you lift your helmet.

1480
01:44:45,830 --> 01:44:48,790
信步走來  和我相吻
And come close to kiss me.

1481
01:44:51,870 --> 01:44:54,160
不過  卻沒有吻成功
But that kiss doesn't happen.

1482
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:55,910
為什么
Why?

1483
01:44:56,250 --> 01:44:59,410
因為鼻子撞了到一起  然后我就醒了
Because the noses collide, and I wake up.

1484
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:02,160
鼻子怎么可能撞到一起  傻瓜
The noses never collide, stupid!

1485
01:45:07,290 --> 01:45:10,370
抱歉  我以為你是琵雅
I'm sorry, I thought you were Pia.

1486
01:45:10,950 --> 01:45:11,910
希望我是
I wish I was.

1487
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:13,990
姐姐  你為什么打斷他
Sis, why did you interrupt?

1488
01:45:14,450 --> 01:45:16,290
他花了4年才說出這些的
It took him four years to say this.

1489
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:19,540
琵雅  吻他  告訴他鼻子碰不到一起
Pia, kiss him. Show that noses don't collide.

1490
01:45:19,620 --> 01:45:22,870
我批準了  吻他  太可愛了
You have my permission, kiss him. He's so cute!

1491
01:45:23,410 --> 01:45:25,080
-這是誰  -我姐姐
- Who's this? - My sister.

1492
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:27,120
你是誰
Who're you?

1493
01:45:36,790 --> 01:45:40,540
你說話的時候  他踢腿來著  是第一次
When you were talking, he kicked. First time!

1494
01:45:40,580 --> 01:45:44,410
他?  你怎么知道是"他"還是"她"
He? How do you know it's a 'he' or 'she'?

1495
01:45:44,700 --> 01:45:46,520
爸爸問過占星師
Papa asked the astrologer

1496
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:48,740
我是生個工程師還是醫生
if we'd get an engineer or a doctor.

1497
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:50,620
什么意思
Meaning?

1498
01:45:50,790 --> 01:45:53,660
男孩是工程師  女孩是醫生
Boy becomes an engineer, girl a doctor.

1499
01:45:54,450 --> 01:45:59,950
冠軍  最好待在里面  外面有個馬戲團
Champ, better stay inside. Out here's a circus.

1500
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:04,790
你外公是團長  他會揮舞長鞭
Your grandpa is the ringmaster. He'll crack his whip

1501
01:46:04,910 --> 01:46:10,330
"跑  生活就是賽跑  做個工程師"
'Run! Life is a race. Be an engineer'

1502
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:16,410
但你得跟著自己的想法走  如果外公嚇唬你
But you follow your heart. If grandpa scares you...

1503
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:20,580
把手放在胸口  說"平安無事"
Put your hand on your heart and say, 'all is well'.

1504
01:46:21,450 --> 01:46:22,290
他又踢了
He kicked.

1505
01:46:24,250 --> 01:46:25,330
再說一遍
Say it again.

1506
01:46:26,540 --> 01:46:28,160
平安無事
All is well.

1507
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:30,740
又踢了
Kicked again.

1508
01:46:32,370 --> 01:46:35,370
-再來  -平安無事
- Once more. - All is well.

1509
01:46:39,870 --> 01:46:44,040
平安無事
All is well.

1510
01:46:44,580 --> 01:46:45,580
是誰
Who is it?

1511
01:46:46,410 --> 01:46:47,410
快走
Go.

1512
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:51,610
你給我爸寄了封討厭的信
You sent hate-mail to Dad,

1513
01:46:51,610 --> 01:46:53,120
我回你封尿信
here's pee-mail for you.

1514
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:57,660
好好享受尿信吧  祝你閱讀愉快
Enjoy the pee-mail, happy reading!

1515
01:47:04,120 --> 01:47:06,870
-誰啊  -你的未來女婿
- Who is it? - Your future son-in-law.

1516
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:08,620
婚禮聚會上的
And the wedding party.

1517
01:47:09,450 --> 01:47:10,540
庫瑞什
Rastogi!

1518
01:47:12,950 --> 01:47:14,790
保安  那邊
Security, that way.

1519
01:47:44,370 --> 01:47:48,120
這么說你們都學會了簡單鐘擺
So you all have already learned about the simple pendulum.

1520
01:47:48,830 --> 01:47:50,640
現在我們開始
Now let's get down to the advanced

1521
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:52,740
進一步學習復擺
study about compound pendulum.

1522
01:47:54,160 --> 01:47:58,160
不規則物體圍繞自己的軸震蕩
It's an irregular object osciliating about its own axis.

1523
01:47:58,580 --> 01:47:59,660
我來演示給你們看
Let me demonstrate to you.

1524
01:48:00,250 --> 01:48:02,200
-這是什么  -鉛筆
- What's this? - Pencil.

1525
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:03,950
-里面是什么  -鉛芯
- What's inside? - Lead.

1526
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,160
很好  鉛芯是鉛筆的軸
Good. Lead is the axis to this pencil.

1527
01:48:06,660 --> 01:48:09,660
就算你是個復擺  如果你震蕩...
Even you can be a compound penduium, if you osciliate about...

1528
01:48:17,290 --> 01:48:19,910

-學習了一晚  校長  -學習?

真的嗎

1534
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:42,040
兩晚沒睡覺  所以他看起來蓬頭垢面的
Hasn't slept two nights, that's why he looks scruffy.

1535
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:43,040
沒睡覺?

1536

可以幫我打封信嗎

這是最終決定  不予更改

他為了看我成為工程師  才活到現在
He lives just to see me become an engineer.

1566
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:43,490
你在門口撒尿時  就該想到這點
Should've thought of that before peeing on my door.

1567
01:50:43,620 --> 01:50:48,080
校長  求求您了  再給我一次機會吧
Sir, give me one chance...please.

1568
01:50:53,660 --> 01:50:57,080

1569
01:50:58,410 --> 01:51:00,580
換成蘭柯

我知道他昨天和你待一起

作我的證人  我就放過你

我們還要繼續生活

或許天堂正在呼喚你

但我們會舉起臂膀與上帝對抗

這場戰斗我們絕對不能輸

雖然他的身體癱瘓了  但仍然有意識
His body is paralyzed with shock, but his mind is alert.

1586
01:53:08,750 --> 01:53:13,080
他能夠看見聽見我們  所以請別在他面前哭
He can see and hear us. Please don't cry in front of him.

新藥起的作用
The new medicine worked.

1590
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,830
一個人沒事了  另個就倒下
Is this your family tradition

1591
01:53:30,620 --> 01:53:33,740
這難道這是你們家的傳統嗎
as one male gets up, the other conks out?

1592
01:53:33,910 --> 01:53:35,660
快醒來
Come, wake up.

在這短暫的旅途中
In this journey of few strides

1601
01:54:11,160 --> 01:54:14,160
我們稱之為生活
On the path called life

1602
01:54:14,330 --> 01:54:20,160
不要輕言放棄  只需為旅途歡慶

你聽說你姐的消息了嗎

她要結婚了

1625
01:56:04,330 --> 01:56:05,660
什么嫁妝都不需要

新郎什么都不要

拉賈

2斤秋葵  1斤免費奶酪  就能叫醒他
One kilo okra, 500 grams cheese for 'free' would've woken him.

為什么我要回家
Why would I go home?

1659
01:58:21,080 --> 01:58:24,540
我們答應過這笨蛋的

1660
01:58:27,870 --> 01:58:29,950
把你的領帶給我

1661
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:32,370
為什么
Why?

1662
01:58:32,580 --> 01:58:36,490
因為你看完這個  就不想去面試了
I doubt you'll go for the interview after reading this.

1663
01:58:37,410 --> 01:58:38,330
什么東西
What's that?

1664
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:41,370
-一封信  -匈牙利寄來的

去巴西熱帶雨林待一年

我爸絕不會同意的

1672
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:27,790
去和他談談  真心的

就一次  不要怕

計程車在外面

只需一點點勇氣  就能改變命運
With just a little courage, you could've turned your life around.

1678
01:59:50,870 --> 01:59:52,830
你覺得他會喜歡嗎
Do you think he'll like it?

1679
01:59:53,450 --> 01:59:55,790
為什么買這么貴的禮物
Why such an expensive gift?

1680
01:59:56,910 --> 01:59:59,370
我們的兒子  今天就要有第一份工作了
Our son's getting his first job today.

1681
02:00:00,660 --> 02:00:04,580
在這么值得驕傲的時刻  就不能太小氣
Don't be stingy at such a proud moment.

1682
02:00:06,500 --> 02:00:07,490
法爾漢?
Farhan?

1683
02:00:12,580 --> 02:00:14,870
你今天不是有面試嗎
Don't you have the job interview today?

1684
02:00:16,660 --> 02:00:17,540
我沒去
I didn't go.

1685
02:00:20,290 --> 02:00:22,040
爸  我不想當工程師
I don't want to be an engineer, Dad.

1686
02:00:26,250 --> 02:00:28,200
怎么了  發生什么事了
What happened? You had an accident?

1687
02:00:31,830 --> 02:00:37,080
看到那樓嗎  我從三樓跳下來了
See that building? I jumped from its third floor.

1688
02:00:39,870 --> 02:00:40,790
為什么
Why?

1689
02:00:41,120 --> 02:00:43,450
因為我被學校勒令退學了
Because I was rusticated from college.

1690
02:00:46,370 --> 02:00:47,200
為什么
Why?

1691
02:00:47,700 --> 02:00:52,540
酗酒  還在校長家門口撒尿
Drunk, I urinated on the director's door.

1692
02:00:54,830 --> 02:00:58,490
那個該死的蘭柯正在腐蝕你的腦子
That scoundrel Rancho is messing with your mind!

1693
02:00:58,620 --> 02:01:02,370
我不喜歡工程學  會是個差勁的工程師
I don't enjoy engineering. I'd make a terrible engineer.

1694
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:09,120
蘭柯的想法很簡單  選自己喜歡的
Rancho has a simple belief, make your passion your profession.

1695
02:01:09,450 --> 02:01:11,040
這樣工作才會開心
Then work wiil become play.

1696
02:01:11,160 --> 02:01:13,080
你在那個叢林里能賺什么錢
What'll you earn in that jungle?

1697
02:01:13,700 --> 02:01:17,370
錢雖然很少  但能學到很多
A small stipend, but I'll learn a lot.

1698
02:01:17,410 --> 02:01:18,620
5年以后
Five years from now...

1699
02:01:19,330 --> 02:01:21,870
當你看到你的朋友們買車
When you see your friends buying cars

1700
02:01:21,880 --> 02:01:24,080
買房  你就會后悔的
and homes, you'll curse yourself.

1701
02:01:24,160 --> 02:01:26,250
工程師的生活  只會讓我更加沮喪
Life as an engineer will bring only frustration.

1702
02:01:26,250 --> 02:01:28,160
那時我會抱怨您的
Then I'll curse you.

1703
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:31,990
我寧愿讓自己后悔
I'd rather curse myself, Dad.

1704
02:01:32,120 --> 02:01:33,330
全世界都會嘲笑你
The world will laugh!

1705
02:01:34,580 --> 02:01:36,580
在最后一年放棄  你個沒用的東西
Label you a loser, for quitting in the final year.

1706
02:01:37,450 --> 02:01:42,000
卡普爾先生覺得你在ICE念書是多值幸運的事
Mr. Kapoor feels you're fortunate to be at ICE.

1707
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,160
他會怎么想
What'll he think?

1708
02:01:43,410 --> 02:01:45,580
卡普爾先生又沒有給我買空調
Mr. Kapoor didn't provide me with an air-conditioner.

1709
02:01:48,370 --> 02:01:50,660
我睡得香時  卡普爾又不會睡得不舒服
It wasn't Mr. Kapoor who slept in discomfort while I slept well.

1710
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,990
又不是他  讓我騎在肩膀上  帶我逛動物園
He didn't take me around the zoo on his shoulders.

1711
02:01:58,830 --> 02:02:00,080
一切都是您做的  爸爸
You did all that, Dad.

1712
02:02:02,540 --> 02:02:07,990
我只在乎您怎么想  他對我一點都不重要
How you feel, matters to me. Mr. Kapoor makes no difference.

1713
02:02:09,160 --> 02:02:11,040
我甚至不知道他叫什么
I don't even know his first name.

1714
02:02:11,160 --> 02:02:14,080
你當你是情景劇里的英雄嗎
You think you're the hero of a melodrama?

1715
02:02:14,250 --> 02:02:16,990
夠了  求你了  他已經很難過了
Enough, please...he's upset.

1716
02:02:18,250 --> 02:02:20,700
老天  請別讓他再做像拉賈那樣的傻事
God forbid, if he did something crazy like Raju...

1717
02:02:20,910 --> 02:02:22,490
那就沒什么好說的了
Then the discussion is over.

1718
02:02:22,790 --> 02:02:26,580
什么都別說了  免得他也跳樓
Don't say a word or his lordship will jump off the roof.

1719
02:02:30,040 --> 02:02:35,040
不  爸爸  我絕不會去自殺  我保證
No, Dad. I'll never attempt suicide. I promise.

1720
02:02:37,540 --> 02:02:44,540
您討厭的蘭柯把這照片放在我錢包里
The Rancho you detest put this picture in my wallet,

1721
02:02:46,120 --> 02:02:49,950
告訴我  每當我有自殺念頭的時候就看看
told me to see it if a suicidal thought crossed my mind.

1722
02:02:50,080 --> 02:02:53,370
并想象當您看見我的尸體時
And imagine what'd happen to your smiles

1723
02:02:53,410 --> 02:02:55,200
您的笑臉會變成什么樣子
when you see my dead body.

1724
02:03:00,500 --> 02:03:04,540
爸爸  我想說服您
I want to convince you, Dad.

1725
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,450
但不是以自殺作為威脅
But not with a suicide threat.

1726
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:16,040
爸爸  如果我變成一個攝影師會怎樣
Dad, what'll happen if I become a photographer?

1727
02:03:16,330 --> 02:03:17,580
我會賺得很少
I'll earn less.

1728
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:20,200
可能房子很小  車子也很小
I'll have a smailer house, a smailer car.

1729
02:03:22,250 --> 02:03:23,790
但我會很快樂的
But I'll be happy.

1730
02:03:25,450 --> 02:03:26,740
我會打心底里開心的
I will be really happy.

1731
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:29,700
我為您做的任何事情都是真心的
Whatever I do for you will be out of genuine love.

1732
02:03:31,620 --> 02:03:33,370
我以前一直聽您的話
I've always listened to you.

1733
02:03:33,750 --> 02:03:36,870
就這一次  請遂了我的心愿吧
For once, let me listen to my heart.

1734
02:03:38,950 --> 02:03:39,870
求您了...爸爸
Please...Dad.

1735
02:03:46,290 --> 02:03:47,240
爸爸
Dad...

1736
02:03:48,450 --> 02:03:49,700
求求您別走
Please don't go away...

1737
02:03:55,910 --> 02:03:57,120
把這個退了吧
Return this.

1738
02:04:00,620 --> 02:04:03,080
兒子  一臺專業的照相機要多少錢
Son, what's the cost of a professional camera?

1739
02:04:04,330 --> 02:04:06,120
這臺筆記本夠換一架嗎
Can the laptop be exchanged for it?

1740
02:04:07,580 --> 02:04:09,450
如果你缺錢  只管開口
If you need more money, just ask.

1741
02:04:18,250 --> 02:04:20,200
去過你想要的生活吧  我的孩子
Go live your life, my son.

1742
02:04:23,120 --> 02:04:27,410
你的成績一直不好  是因為什么
Your grades are consistently poor. Reason?

1743
02:04:28,080 --> 02:04:28,950
恐懼
Fear.

1744
02:04:30,040 --> 02:04:31,450
我從小就是個好學生
I was a good student since childhood.

1745
02:04:32,200 --> 02:04:34,370
父母希望我能夠讓他們致富
Parents hoped I'd end their poverty.

1746
02:04:36,290 --> 02:04:37,290
這讓我恐懼
That scared me.

1747
02:04:38,790 --> 02:04:42,290
就像比賽  如果不是第一  那什么都不是
Here I saw the mad race. You don't count if you're not first.

1748
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,040
這讓我愈加地恐懼
My fear grew.

1749
02:04:46,700 --> 02:04:48,160
恐懼對成績沒有好處  先生
Fear is not good for grades, sir.

1750
02:04:48,790 --> 02:04:51,200
于是我帶上更多的護符和戒指
I slipped on more charms and rings.

1751
02:04:52,200 --> 02:04:56,660
祈禱神的幫助  不  是祈求
Prayed to god for favors. No...begged for favors.

1752
02:04:59,750 --> 02:05:02,870
斷了16根骨頭  我卻有了2個月時間去反思
16 broken bones gave me two months to think and reflect.

1753
02:05:03,410 --> 02:05:04,660
最終  我醒悟了
Finaliy, sense dawned.

1754
02:05:06,160 --> 02:05:08,980
今天  我并不祈求這個工作
Today I didn't beg god for this job,

1755
02:05:08,980 --> 02:05:11,330
只是感謝老天給我的生命
just thanked him for this life.

1756
02:05:13,790 --> 02:05:17,790
如果你們拒絕我  我不會遺憾
If you reject me, no regrets.

1757
02:05:18,120 --> 02:05:22,240
我會繼續去完成生命中有意義的事
I'll still do something worthwhile with my life.

1758
02:05:22,790 --> 02:05:27,990
這樣的坦白對我們公司來說  并不是太好
Such frank behavior is not good for our firm.

1759
02:05:28,580 --> 02:05:32,870
我們需要的是  擅長與客戶打交道的人
We need someone diplomatic to handle clients.

1760
02:05:32,950 --> 02:05:35,330
你太直接了

如果你能向我們保證  你會控制好態度
If you assure us you'll control this attitude,

1763
02:05:45,790 --> 02:05:48,790
或許可以考慮一下
we may consider you.

1764
02:05:52,120 --> 02:05:55,290
斷了兩條腿才讓我真正獨立
It took two broken legs to get me up on my feet.

1765
02:05:57,160 --> 02:05:58,990
好不容易有這種態度
Wasn't easy to get this attitude.

1766
02:05:59,700 --> 02:06:00,580
改變不了了  先生
Can't change it, sir.

1767
02:06:04,250 --> 02:06:09,490
你保留你的職位  我保留我的態度

1768
02:06:09,620 --> 02:06:10,990
對不起  請別見怪
I'm sorry, no offense, sir.

1769
02:06:15,370 --> 02:06:16,240
等一下
Wait.

02:06:18,200 --> 02:06:22,200
25年來  我面試了無數多的人
I've interviewed countiess candidates for 25 years.

1771
02:06:22,620 --> 02:06:25,490
每個人為了得到工作  都扮演成好好先生
Everyone turns into a yes-man to get the job.

1772
02:06:25,660 --> 02:06:27,040
你是從哪兒冒出來的  孩子
Where did you spring from, son?

1773
02:06:28,950 --> 02:06:29,790
先生?
Sir?

1774
02:06:30,040 --> 02:06:32,660
我們要談談工資嗎
Shall we discuss the salary?

1775
02:06:40,200 --> 02:06:41,120
太謝謝了
Thank you, sir.

1776
02:07:13,660 --> 02:07:17,870
我敬愛的陛下  您崇高偉大

02:08:03,540 --> 02:08:07,040
您說的  "如果他找到工作  就刮我胡子"
You had said, 'if he gets a job, shave it off.'

1780
02:08:14,250 --> 02:08:15,290
你做什么了
What have you done?

1781
02:08:18,870 --> 02:08:22,290
我感覺沒了胡子  就像沒穿衣服
I feel naked without my moustache.

1782
02:08:24,580 --> 02:08:26,490
我沒尊嚴了
I've lost my dignity.

1783
02:08:28,580 --> 02:08:31,040
我不會善罷甘休的  瑞絲奇
I won't accept defeat, Rastogi.

1784
02:08:32,330 --> 02:08:36,370
你過不了期末考試  就得不到工作
The job isn't yours until you pass your final exam.

1785
02:08:37,830 --> 02:08:41,790
這次由我來出卷子

爸爸  那不公平
Dad, that's not fair.

1787

愛情和戰爭中所有事都是公平的
Everything is fair in love and war.

1788
02:08:53,950 --> 02:08:57,290
這將是第三次...世界大戰

It's rude to leave the ceremony.

1883
02:16:15,790 --> 02:16:17,450
-法爾漢?  -車準備好了
- Yeah, Farhan? - The car's ready.

1884
02:16:17,790 --> 02:16:20,410
抓住她的手就跑  別動
Grab her hand and run. Don't move.

1885
02:16:21,910 --> 02:16:23,540
-先生...  -我的外套呢
- Sir... - My coat?

1886
02:16:23,580 --> 02:16:24,740
你在這兒...
You're here...

1887
02:16:24,910 --> 02:16:26,540
-那在圣壇的是誰啊  -圣壇?
- So who's at the altar? - Altar?

1888
02:16:28,830 --> 02:16:31,330
再轉幾圈  我們就算結婚了
Another couple of rounds, and we'll be considered married.

1889
02:16:31,500 --> 02:16:33,790
我已經結過婚了  琵雅  我們走吧
I'm already married, Pia. Let's go.

1890
02:16:34,250 --> 02:16:37,540
太遲了  人們會笑話我的
It's too late. People will laugh at me.

1891
02:16:37,790 --> 02:16:39,580
那你就這么毀掉幸福?
So you'll commit suicide?

1892
02:16:40,160 --> 02:16:41,080
瑞絲奇
Rastogi!

1893
02:16:41,160 --> 02:16:43,290
他們也就傳言一段時間  馬上就會忘的
People will gossip briefly, then forget.

1894
02:16:44,660 --> 02:16:47,660
但是你...你會后悔死的
But you...you'll regret on your deathbed.

1895
02:16:47,750 --> 02:16:50,540
車就在門口  馬上就能和蘭柯一起
That the car was at the gate, Rancho within reach...

1896
02:16:50,870 --> 02:16:54,370
就因為怕這些人  你就嫁給這混蛋
But in fear of people, you married this ass.

1897
02:16:56,540 --> 02:16:57,490
你不是內個客房服務嗎
Housekeeping?

1898
02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:40,240
琵雅  還有個小問題
Pia, minor problem.

1899
02:17:40,540 --> 02:17:41,450
什么
What?

1900
02:17:41,830 --> 02:17:43,450
我們不知道蘭柯是不是結婚了
We don't know if Rancho's married.

1901
02:17:43,540 --> 02:17:44,370
什么
What!

1902
02:17:44,450 --> 02:17:47,120
-他不會結婚的  -那如果結了呢
- He won't be married. - And if he is?

1903
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:49,410
那我們再送你回來
Then we'll drop you back.

1904
02:17:50,290 --> 02:17:54,080
放輕松  手工餅干吃嗎
Relax! Handmade biscuit?.

1905
02:17:57,910 --> 02:17:58,790
他怎么在這兒
What's he doing here?

1906
02:17:59,830 --> 02:18:03,240
別管他  這餅干很好吃的
Ignore him - the biscuit's very good.

1907
02:18:04,290 --> 02:18:06,160
到昨天為止  我都是個守法公民
Till yesterday, I was a law-abiding citizen.

1908
02:18:06,660 --> 02:18:10,540
但在過去的24小時  我迫降了一架飛機
But in the last 24 hours, I'd grounded an aircraft.

1909
02:18:11,330 --> 02:18:13,790
差點把某人的骨灰沖進下水道
Almost assigned Shamaldas's ashes to the sewers,

1910
02:18:14,040 --> 02:18:16,580
并讓一個新娘從自己的婚禮上逃婚
and made a bride elope from her own wedding!

1911
02:18:16,580 --> 02:18:18,450
全因為蘭柯
All for Rancho.

1912
02:18:19,910 --> 02:18:22,040
但他也一樣  會為朋友做任何事
But he too would do anything for friends.

1913
02:18:22,290 --> 02:18:25,790
例如從病毒的辦公室偷考卷
Like stealing the question paper...from the lion's den.

1914
02:18:25,870 --> 02:18:26,910
用紅色封印的信封
Envelope with the red seal.

1915
02:18:27,910 --> 02:18:32,910
他擔心如果拉賈沒考過  又會尋短見
He feared that if Raju failed, there'd be another high jump.

1916
02:18:36,080 --> 02:18:41,070
我們是有操守的賊  只為拉賈偷試卷
We were principled thieves, stealing the paper only for Raju.

1917
02:18:41,750 --> 02:18:42,870
我們發誓自己不會偷看一眼
We'd sworn we won't even take a peek.

1918
02:18:45,580 --> 02:18:46,910
藏在哪兒了...
Where's it hidden...

1919
02:18:47,080 --> 02:18:50,700
我們猴年馬月能找到啊  問問琵雅吧
We'll grow old searching! Ask Pia.

1920
02:18:56,910 --> 02:18:58,080
琵雅  你電話
Pia, your phone.

1921
02:18:59,330 --> 02:19:00,000
準父親大人
Mr. Papa-to-be,

1922
02:19:00,010 --> 02:19:02,580
如果你說"平安無事"  他就會踢一下
if you say 'all is well', he kicks.

1923
02:19:02,660 --> 02:19:03,490
他踢了
He kicked.

1924
02:19:05,950 --> 02:19:07,450
琵雅  你電話
Pia, your phone.

1925
02:19:09,070 --> 02:19:10,670
老爸辦公室

1926
02:19:13,290 --> 02:19:14,540
找到了  蘭柯
Found it! Rancho.

1927
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:16,990
喂?
Hello?

1928
02:19:35,410 --> 02:19:37,660
快  復印一份
Quick, photocopy this.

1929
02:19:58,750 --> 02:19:59,620
原來放在哪兒的
Where was it?

1930
02:19:59,910 --> 02:20:00,910
放回去
Put it back.

1931
02:20:24,250 --> 02:20:26,290
-安全到達  -你們去哪兒了
- We're safe! - Where were you?

1932
02:20:30,870 --> 02:20:32,580
-給  -是什么
- Here. - What's this?

1933
02:20:32,910 --> 02:20:33,830
小意思
A gift.

1934
02:20:34,950 --> 02:20:38,870
考卷  病毒自己出的題專門要掛你
Question paper. Virus set it himself, to fail you.

1935
02:20:46,450 --> 02:20:47,790
奇怪啊  哥們
Strange buddies!

1936
02:20:49,120 --> 02:20:50,710
開始告訴你要正直
First teach you to be upright,

1937
02:20:50,710 --> 02:20:53,700
接著又給你一條通向可恥的道
then offer a path to shame.

1938
02:20:55,750 --> 02:20:56,790
不行
No way.

1939
02:20:58,370 --> 02:20:59,740
如果我過了  也是自己努力的結果
If I pass, it'll be on my own steam.

1940
02:21:03,620 --> 02:21:04,790
如果沒過  也沒什么
If I don't, it's still ok.

1941
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:26,540
他把我倆說服了  我們像家人一樣緊緊相擁
He'd won us over! I felt like embracing him as a family...

1942
02:21:27,450 --> 02:21:29,370
但是接著我控制了下自己的感情
but then I controlled my emotions.

1943
02:21:48,450 --> 02:21:51,450
-該死的賊  -校長  求你了  校長
- Damn thief. - Sir, please, sir.

1944
02:21:51,580 --> 02:21:54,790
-騙子  -別這樣  校長
- Rascai. - Sorry sir.

1945
02:21:55,330 --> 02:21:56,620
想要改變教育制度
Wanted to change the system,

1946
02:21:58,330 --> 02:22:00,130
在我家門口撒尿
you'll pee on my door.

1947
02:22:00,130 --> 02:22:03,290
校長  您這是干什么呢
Sir, what're you doing?

1948
02:22:04,790 --> 02:22:05,790
住手啊  校長
Sorry sir.

1949
02:22:07,250 --> 02:22:09,120
你們被開除了
You are rusticated!

1950
02:22:09,910 --> 02:22:12,910
如果你們明天早上不離開  我就叫警察了
If all of you aren't out by morning, I'll call the police.

1951
02:22:13,330 --> 02:22:14,660
我會叫警察的
I will call the police!

1952
02:22:17,160 --> 02:22:17,990
騙子
Rascais!

1953
02:22:18,330 --> 02:22:19,660
一群騙子  你們都是
Rascais, all of you.

1954
02:22:23,660 --> 02:22:25,990
他怎么會有我辦公室的鑰匙
How did he get my office key?

1955
02:22:27,290 --> 02:22:28,700
我給他的  爸爸
I gave him the key, Dad.

1956
02:22:30,080 --> 02:22:32,190
我希望我能把這把鑰匙給我弟弟
I wish I'd given this key to my brother...

1957
02:22:32,190 --> 02:22:33,700
這樣他今天就還活著
he'd be alive today.

1958
02:22:33,870 --> 02:22:34,790
別說了  琵雅
Stop it, Pia.

1959
02:22:35,910 --> 02:22:38,740
你以為你兒子是掉下火車死的嗎
You think your son fell off a train and died?

1960
02:22:39,290 --> 02:22:40,200
閉嘴  琵雅
Shut up, Pia!

1961
02:22:40,290 --> 02:22:42,580
你決定讓他做個工程師
You decided he'd be an engineer.

1962
02:22:42,750 --> 02:22:45,040
你到底有沒有問過他想做什么
Did you ever ask him what he wanted to be?

1963
02:22:45,830 --> 02:22:47,410
你給了他那么大的壓力
You put such a pressure on him...

1964
02:22:47,790 --> 02:22:50,080
他選擇死亡來擺脫入學考試
that he chose death over the entrance exam.

1965
02:22:54,330 --> 02:22:55,200
我不明白...
I don't understand...

1966
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,580
爸  你回房間去吧
Dad, you go to your room.

1967
02:23:02,450 --> 02:23:04,830
琵雅  別這么做
Pia, don't do this.

1968
02:23:07,290 --> 02:23:11,200
他想學文學  當個作家
He wanted to study literature, be a writer.

1969
02:23:13,450 --> 02:23:15,950
但他僅有的作品就是這封遺書
But all he wrote was this suicide note.

1970
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:17,290
把那個收起來吧  求你了
Put that away, please.

1971
02:23:17,450 --> 02:23:19,120
別再粉飾太平了
No more cover-ups!

1972
02:23:22,500 --> 02:23:25,740
哪怕一次...
Just once...

1973
02:23:25,790 --> 02:23:29,490
你如果說  你不想就別學工程系
if you'd said - don't do engineering if you don't want to

1974
02:23:30,330 --> 02:23:31,740
就做你心里想做的
just do what your heart is in,

1975
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:34,950
那么今天他就還活著
then he'd be alive today.

1976
02:23:42,870 --> 02:23:44,950
他不是自殺的
He didn't commit suicide.

1977
02:23:45,660 --> 02:23:46,660
你說得對  爸爸
You're right, Dad,

1978
02:23:48,200 --> 02:23:49,450
那不是自殺...
it wasn't suicide...

1979
02:23:51,910 --> 02:23:52,990
是謀殺
It was murder.

1980
02:24:08,910 --> 02:24:11,790
市區很多道路完全被水湮沒
Many city roads are completely submerged,

1981
02:24:11,830 --> 02:24:13,830
交通已經癱瘓
traffic has come to a standstill.

1982
02:24:27,750 --> 02:24:31,580
爸...
Dad...

1983
02:24:32,660 --> 02:24:33,620
莫娜  你怎么啦
Mona?

1984
02:24:37,790 --> 02:24:40,290
快回去  小個子  你跟著我們干嗎
Go back, Milimeter. Why're you following us?

1985
02:24:40,830 --> 02:24:43,120
干嗎  路又不是你家的
Why? Your pop owns the road?

1986
02:24:43,250 --> 02:24:44,950
請幫幫忙  我們現在走投無路了
Please help, we are desperate here!

1987
02:24:45,910 --> 02:24:47,790
你不能派救護車過來嗎
You can't send an ambulance?

1988
02:24:48,790 --> 02:24:50,700
從別家醫院調一輛車來
Get it from another hospital.

1989
02:24:51,330 --> 02:24:54,870
整個城市都遭水災了  我們無能為力啊
The entire city's flooded, sir. We're helpless.

1990
02:24:58,370 --> 02:24:59,660
莫娜  你還好嗎
Mona, you ok?

1991
02:25:00,200 --> 02:25:01,200
蘭柯  是琵雅
Rancho, Pia.

1992
02:25:03,580 --> 02:25:06,320
蘭柯  你們沒辦法來醫院了
Rancho, you can't reach here.

1993
02:25:06,320 --> 02:25:07,450
按我說的做
Do as I say.

1994
02:25:07,750 --> 02:25:12,620
羊水已經破了
The water bag has burst.

1995
02:25:13,620 --> 02:25:16,160
竟然通話結束  莫娜
Disconnected! Mona.

1996
02:25:21,370 --> 02:25:22,370
莫娜
Mona!

1997
02:25:26,750 --> 02:25:28,290
-打開燈  -放到哪兒
- Turn on the lights. - Where to?

1998
02:25:28,790 --> 02:25:30,370
桌上  乒乓球桌上
To the table, tennis table.

1999
02:25:30,370 --> 02:25:32,740
琵雅  我們到休息室了
Pia, we're in the common room.

2000
02:25:36,700 --> 02:25:38,580
拉賈  打開攝像頭
Raju, turn on the web camera.

2001
02:25:44,700 --> 02:25:45,870
莫娜呢  讓我看到她
Where's Mona? Show me.

2002
02:25:47,410 --> 02:25:48,370
稍等
Hold on.

2003
02:25:50,580 --> 02:25:51,450
這里  琵雅
Here, Pia.

2004
02:25:51,750 --> 02:25:54,660
姐姐  別怕  我在這兒呢
Mona, don't worry. I'm with you.

2005
02:25:54,750 --> 02:25:55,740
琵雅  我要死了
Pia, I'm dying!

2006
02:25:56,120 --> 02:25:58,950
蘭柯  就算沒有醫院和醫生
Rancho, even when there were no hospitals or docs

2007
02:25:58,950 --> 02:26:00,290
也可以接生
babies were delivered.

2008
02:26:00,870 --> 02:26:03,200
你們要一起把這個孩子生下來
You all will deliver this baby.

2009
02:26:05,870 --> 02:26:07,450
平安無事
All is well.

2010
02:26:07,580 --> 02:26:10,580
你們好大膽子  我要宰了你們
How dare you? I'll kill you.

2011
02:26:10,700 --> 02:26:12,740
爸  這事兒你別管了
Dad, stay out of this.

2012
02:26:13,700 --> 02:26:15,870
法爾漢  拿毛巾和剪刀
Farhan, get towels and scissors.

2013
02:26:15,910 --> 02:26:18,410
小個子  拿些布條和熱水
Millimeter, get clothes clips and hot water.

2014
02:26:18,660 --> 02:26:20,160
蘭柯  把莫娜蓋起來
Rancho, cover Mona.

2015
02:26:27,700 --> 02:26:29,240
姐姐  試著使勁
Mona, try pushing.

2016
02:26:29,660 --> 02:26:33,620
盡全力使勁
Push with all your might.

2017
02:26:33,870 --> 02:26:36,290
別嚎了  我不行啊
Stop it! I can't do it.

2018

就把這個吸盤放在孩子頭上

法爾漢  你去拿吸塵器  我來搞定電源
Farhan, you get the vacuum, I'll get the power.

2050
02:28:22,830 --> 02:28:23,830
怎么搞定
How?

2051
02:28:24,500 --> 02:28:25,990
小個子  把病毒弄出去
Millimeter, get virus out.

2052
02:28:27,370 --> 02:28:30,040
這是干什么啊
What nonsense is this!

2053
02:28:30,250 --> 02:28:33,830

2105
02:33:01,830 --> 02:33:02,870
往他嘴里吹氣

2106

沒反應
No response.

2108
02:33:41,620 --> 02:33:45,240
莫娜  會平安無事的
Hush Mona, say "all is well".

2109
02:33:50,500 --> 02:33:51,450
他踢了一下
He kicked.

2110
02:33:52,750 --> 02:33:53,620
什么
What?

2111
02:33:54,500 --> 02:33:55,790
他踢了一下
He kicked.

2112
02:33:59,250 --> 02:34:00,580
說"平安無事"
Say "all is well".

2113
02:34:02,200 --> 02:34:07,120
平安無事
All is well.

2114
02:34:50,540 --> 02:34:53,910
如果病毒當時說一句"我孫子要做個工程師"
If Virus had said, "my grandson will be an engineer"

2115
02:34:54,040 --> 02:34:55,910
我會海扁他一頓
I would've broken his jaw.

2116
02:34:56,580 --> 02:34:59,410
但他最終說的那句話把我們大家都震住了
But when he finally spoke, he stunned us.

2117

等等  我跟你還沒完呢

2120
02:35:29,700 --> 02:35:32,290
大學第一天  你問了我一個問題...
First day of college, you'd asked me a question...

2121
02:35:32,620 --> 02:35:35,040
宇航員在太空為什么不用鉛筆
Why didn't astronauts use a pencil in space?

2122
02:35:35,790 --> 02:35:38,080
如果鉛筆尖斷了
If a pencil tip breaks,

2123
02:35:38,250 --> 02:35:40,460
它會因為沒有重力浮在空中
it'd float in zero gravity.

2124
02:35:40,460 --> 02:35:44,160
進入眼睛里  鼻子里  儀器里...
Get into eyes, nose, instruments...

2125
02:35:44,290 --> 02:35:46,240
所以你錯了
You were wrong.

2126
02:35:47,830 --> 02:35:49,700
你不能總是對的
You cannot be right all the time.

2127
02:35:51,790 --> 02:35:52,830
你明白嗎
You understand?

2128
02:35:55,250 --> 02:35:56,120
明白  校長
Yes, sir.

2129
02:35:57,370 --> 02:35:59,490
這是個很重要的發明

2130
02:36:00,790 --> 02:36:01,830
你知道嗎
You understand?

2131
02:36:03,200 --> 02:36:04,080
知道  校長
Yes, sir.

2132
02:36:06,620 --> 02:36:11,040
我的導師曾經說"當你遇到一個杰出的學生..."
My director said, 'when you find an extraordinary student...'

2133
02:36:33,870 --> 02:36:38,330
去吧  學習去  通過考試再離開
Go, study! Pass your exams and leave.

2134
02:36:47,200 --> 02:36:49,330
現在宣布年度學生獎...
And now, student of the year...

2135
02:36:49,540 --> 02:36:52,040
蘭柯霍達斯·沙瑪達斯·昌恰德
Ranchhoddas shamaldas chanchad

2136
02:37:09,660 --> 02:37:10,990
校長  一起合個影
Sir, one photo.

2137
02:37:28,450 --> 02:37:31,910
我想抓住所有這些瞬間  并把它們帶回家
I wanted to capture all these memories and take them home.

2138
02:37:33,950 --> 02:37:38,870
那天  我們擁抱  我們慶祝  我們哭泣...
That day, we hugged, we rejoiced, we cried...

2139
02:37:39,620 --> 02:37:41,290
我們發誓說每年大家最少相聚一次...
We vowed that we'd meet at least once a year...

2140
02:37:41,950 --> 02:37:45,410
誰料到  那竟是我們最后一次見蘭柯
Who knew then, we were seeing Rancho for the last time.

2141
02:38:19,330 --> 02:38:20,290
解開他
Untie him.

2142
02:38:23,620 --> 02:38:25,540
我要把你們全部告上美國法庭
I'll sue you all in an American court.

2143
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:40,870
拉賈
Raju.

2144
02:38:59,870 --> 02:39:01,870
只有蘭柯才會辦一個這樣的學校
Only Rancho can create a school like this.

2145
02:39:02,410 --> 02:39:03,490
但他人在哪兒呢
But where is he?

2146
02:39:07,950 --> 02:39:09,200
別在這兒撒尿
Don't pee here.

2147
02:39:10,290 --> 02:39:11,910
走開  小東西
Go away creatures.

2148
02:39:12,290 --> 02:39:15,370
-別在這里撒尿  -不然我摑你
- Don't pee here. - I'll smack you.

2149
02:39:33,120 --> 02:39:35,330
這就對了  他肯定在附近
Bingo! He cannot be far.

2150
02:39:46,790 --> 02:39:49,080
請問一下  蘭柯霍達斯在哪兒
Excuse me, where is Ranchhoddas?

2151
02:39:49,200 --> 02:39:50,450
他不叫蘭柯霍達斯
He's not Ranchhoddas!

2152
02:39:50,450 --> 02:39:51,200
蘭柯...
Rancho...

2153
02:39:51,290 --> 02:39:53,490
徹侯特...見鬼  他到底叫什么
Chhote...dammit, what's his name?

2154
02:39:53,620 --> 02:39:56,330
冷靜一下  跟我來

2172
02:41:39,450 --> 02:41:42,080
騎著摩托而來  裝扮得宛如新娘
on a scooter, dressed as a bride.

2173
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,290

What pen, sir? I didn't get you...

2256
02:47:10,870 --> 02:47:15,080

2263
02:47:40,660 --> 02:47:42,290
完全打敗我了  做得好

2265
02:47:47,410 --> 02:47:50,620
查特啊  接著這個
Hey Chatur, take that.

2266
02:47:51,250 --> 02:47:53,240
我剛才那是開玩笑的
I was just joking, man.

2267
02:47:53,620 --> 02:47:57,490
我深知你會大展宏圖
Deep down, I knew you'd do great things.

2268
02:47:58,500 --> 02:48:00,290
你坑爹呢
You're fibbing.

2269
02:48:00,370 --> 02:48:02,330
沒有  真的  我發誓

蘭柯100分  查特0分
Rancho - 100, Chatur - 0.

2271
02:48:04,790 --> 02:48:07,120
你贏了  我輸了  你還不相信我嗎
You win, I lose. You don't believe me?

2272
02:48:08,540 --> 02:48:09,910
小心他要放屁
Beware of farts.

2273
02:48:09,950 --> 02:48:14,240
我敬愛的陛下  您崇高偉大  請接受這謙卑的問候
Your majesty, thou art great. Accept this humble offering.

2274
02:48:14,330 --> 02:48:15,520
免費建議  旺都先生
Free advice, Mr. Wangdu,

2275

為了你的生活  跑吧

2276
02:48:20,410 --> 02:48:24,490
蘭柯  我會丟了工作的  我上有老下有小...
Rancho, I'll lose my job, man. I have small kids...

2277
02:48:25,450 --> 02:48:27,990
那個偉大的精神領袖蘭柯霍達斯曾說過
His holiness guru Ranchhoddas had correctly stated,

2278
02:48:28,200 --> 02:48:33,200
追求卓越  成功就會找上你
follow excellence...success will chase you, pants down.
