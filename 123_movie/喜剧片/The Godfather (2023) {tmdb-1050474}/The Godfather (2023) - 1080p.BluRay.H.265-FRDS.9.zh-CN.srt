2
00:00:54,610 --> 00:01:01,010
教 父

3
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,310
我信仰美国
I believe in America.

4
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,340
美国让我发了财
America has made my fortune...

5
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,110
而且我按美国方式教养我的女儿
and I raised my daughter in the American fashion.

6
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,280
我给了她自由，但是…
I give her freedom, but...

7
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,530
我教导她永远不要有辱家门
I taught her never to dishonor her family.

8
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,740
她找了个男友，不是意大利人
She found a boyfriend. Not an Italian.

9
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,530
她跟他去看电影
She went to the movies with him.

10
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,610
她在外面待很晚
She stayed out late.

11
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,340
我没有反对
I didn't protest.

12
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,910
两个月前，他带她去兜风
Two months ago, he took her for a drive...

13
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,210
还有另一个男孩
with another boyfriend.

14
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,240
他们灌她喝威士忌
They made her drink whiskey...

15
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:52,460
然后，他们想要占她便宜
and then they tried to take advantage of her.

16
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,330
她反抗了
She resisted.

17
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,130
她保住了她的名节
She kept her honor.

18
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,000
于是他们打她，像是打动物
So they beat her like an animal.

19
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:07,860
等我去到医院，她的鼻梁断了
When I went to the hospital, her nose was broken...

20
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,130
她的下巴被打碎了
her jaw was shattered...

21
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,290
用钢丝固定起来
held together by wire.

22
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,340
因为疼痛，她甚至不能哭泣
She couldn't even weep because of the pain.

23
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,040
但我哭了
But I wept.

24
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,540
我为什么哭呢？
Why did I weep?

25
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,650
她是我生命之光
She was the light of my life.

26
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,880
美丽的女孩
Beautiful girl.

27
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,390
现在她再也不会美丽了
Now she will never be beautiful again.

28
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,360
对不起
Sorry.

29
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,760
我…我去找警察，像个本分的美国人那样
I went to the police like a good American.

30
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,790
那两个男孩被带去审判
These two boys were brought to trial.

31
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:09,310
法官判他们坐牢三年，缓期执行
A judge sentence them to three years in prison...and suspend their sentence.

32
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,700
缓期执行
Suspended sentence.

33
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,040
他们当天就获得自由
They went free that very day.

34
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,690
我像个傻瓜似的站在法庭上
I stood in the courtroom like a fool.

35
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,860
而那两个杂种，竟朝着我笑
And those two bastard, they smiled at me.

36
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,960
于是我对我妻子说
Then I said to my wife

37
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:32,240
“为求公道，我们必须去找唐・柯利昂尼”
"For justice we must go to Don Corleone."

38
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,310
你干嘛去找警察？你干嘛不先来找我？
Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first?

39
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,880
你要我做什么？
What do you want of me?

40
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,950
尽管吩咐，但一定要做我恳求你做的事
Tell me anything, but do what I beg you to do.

41
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,950
什么事？
What is that?

42
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,440
那我办不到
That I cannot do.

43
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,520
你要什么  我都会给你
I'll give you anything you ask.

44
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:27,120
我们相识多年，但这是你第一次来找我咨询帮忙
We've known each other many years, but this is the first time you ever came to me for counsel or for help.

45
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,380
我都记不起上回是什么时候……
I can't remember the last time that...

46
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,290
你请我到你家去喝杯咖啡
you invited me to your house for a cup of coffee.

47
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,060
虽然我妻子是你独生女的教母
even though my wife is godmother to your only child.

48
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,500
咱们坦白说吧
But let's be frank here.

49
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,970
你从来不想要我的友谊
You never wanted my friendship...

50
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,240
而且…你害怕欠我人情
and you were afraid to be in my debt.

51
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,870
我不想惹上麻烦
I didn't want to get into trouble.

52
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,610
我理解
I understand.

53
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,600
你在美国发现了乐园
You found paradise in America.

54
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,060
你有一门好生意，过上了好生活
You had a good trade, made a good living.

55
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,730
警察保护你，而且还有法院
Police protected you, and there were courts of law.

56
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,270
你不需要我这种朋友
So you didn't need a friend like me.

57
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:11,470
但是，现在你来找我说
But now you come to me and you say...

58
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,490
“唐・柯利昂尼，给我公道”
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

59
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,750
但你提要求时并无敬意
But you don't ask with respect.

60
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,350
你没有献上友谊
You don't offer friendship.

61
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,390
你甚至没想叫我“教父”
You don't even think to call me "Godfather."

62
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,920
相反，你来到我家，在我女儿出嫁这天
Instead, you come into my house...on the day my daughter is to be married...

63
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,270
你还要求我去杀人，为了钱
and you ask me to do murder for money.

64
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,990
我要求你主持公道
I ask you for justice.

65
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,240
那不是公道，你女儿还活着
That is not justice. Your daughter is still alive.

66
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,320
那么他们一定得受罪，如同她一样
They must suffer then, as she suffers.

67
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,490
我应该付你多少钱？
How much shall I pay you?

68
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:05,480
博纳塞拉  博纳塞拉
Bonasera. Bonasera.

69
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,840
到底我做了什么让你待我如此不尊重？
What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully?

70
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,370
如果你带着友谊来找我
If you'd come to me in friendship...

71
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:18,280
那么毁了你女儿的渣滓当天就会遭难
then the scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day.

72
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,350
而且如果你这种诚实人偶尔树敌
And if, by chance an honest man like yourself should make enemies...

73
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,920
那么他们就会成为我的敌人
then they would become my enemies.

74
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,790
这样他们就会害怕你
And then they would fear you.

75
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,390
做我的朋友？
Be my friend?

76
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,500
教父
Godfather.

77
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,100
很好
Good.

78
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,430
有一天，这一天也许永远不会到来…
Someday, and that day may never come...

79
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,710
我会打电话要你为我效一次劳
I'll call upon you to do a service for me.

80
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,530
但在那一天到来之前
But until that day...

81
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,280
收下这份公道，当做我女儿结婚这天的一份礼物吧
accept this justice as a gift on my daughter's wedding day.

82
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,510
- 谢谢[意大利语]教父  - 别客气[意大利语]
- Gràzie, Godfather. - Prego

83
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:16,730
这件事交给… 克里门萨
Give this to Clemenza.

84
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,720
我要用可靠的人，不会冲动的人
I want reliable people, people that aren't going to be carried away.

85
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:26,310
我说，我们不是杀人犯，不管这位殡葬人怎么说
I mean, we're not murderers... in spite of what this undertaker says.

86
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,530
- 迈克尔在哪里？  - 什么？别担心，还早呢，他会来的
- Where's Michael? - What? Don't worry. It's early. He'll be here.

87
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,400
没有迈克尔我们不照相
We're not taking the picture without Michael.

88
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,060
（意大利语）

89
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,480
- 怎么回事，桑尼？  - 是迈克尔的事
-What's the matter, Sonny? -It's Michael.

90
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,320
唐・巴茨尼
Don Barzini.

91
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,880
（意大利语）

92
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,620
喂，泡利，给我点酒
Hey, Paulie! Let me have some wine.

93
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,860
泡利，再来些酒
Paulie! More wine.

94
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,760
对不起[意大利语]，给
Scusi, please.

95
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,340
- 啊，你看起来棒极了 - 你算什么？舞蹈裁判吗？
- Ah, you look "terrif" on the floor. - What are you, a dance judge or something?

96
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,710
（意大利语）

97
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,710
去小区里转转，做好你的工作
Go take a walk around the neighborhood. Do your job.

98
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,110
桑德拉，帮个忙，看住孩子们，别让他们乱跑，好吗？
Hey, Sandra, come on, do me a favor. Watch the kids. Don't let 'em run wild, all right?

99
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,570
噢，你看好你自己，好吗？
You watch yourself, all right?

100
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:10,010
两三万，小额现钞
Twenty or thirty grand. In small bills, cash.

101
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,800
在那个小丝袋里
In that little silk purse.

102
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:16,550
如果这是别人的婚礼…真不幸[意大利语]
If this was somebody else's wedding. Sfortunato!

103
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,400
泡利，我这儿有两个gobbagool，gabagol还有熏火腿
Hey, Paulie! I got two gobbagool... gabagol and a prosciutto.

104
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,470
…蠢货
Stupid jerk!

105
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,680
喂，怎么回事？
Hey, what's the matter?

106
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,620
- 我得回去工作了 - 汤姆
- Have to go back to work. - Oh, Tom.

107
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,640
这是婚礼的一部分
It's part of the wedding.

108
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:53,120
没有西西里人在女儿结婚那天 能拒绝任何的请求
No Sicilian can refuse any request on his daughter's wedding day.

109
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:04,160
唐・柯利昂尼，我十分荣幸并感激你邀请我到你家
Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home

110
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,900
你们在干什么？滚开
What're you doing? Get outta here.

111
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,910
这是私人宴会，快走
This is a private party. Go on.

112
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,950
这算什么？喂，我妹妹的婚礼
What is it? Hey, my sister's wedding.

113
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,520
该死的FBI，什么都不尊重
Goddamn FBI don't respect nothin'.

114
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:32,540
喂，过来，过来过来，给你
Hey, come here, come here. Come here! There.

115
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:50,360
但是快结束时，他被假释去帮助美国战时生产
But towards the end he was paroled to help with the American war effort.

116
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:53,310
所以过去六个月他在我的糕饼店做事
So for the last six months, he's been working at my pastry shop.

117
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,020
纳佐林，我的朋友，我能为你做什么？
Nazorine, my friend, what can I do for you?

118
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,110
现在战争结束了
Now that the war is over...

119
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,210
这个男孩恩佐，他们要把他遣返意大利
this boy, Enzo, they want to repatriate him back to Italy.

120
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,140
教父，我有个女儿
Godfather, I have a daughter.

121
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:08,340
你看，她和恩佐…
See, she and Enzo--

122
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:13,160
你要恩佐留在这个国家，和你女儿成亲
You want Enzo to stay in this country and you want your daughter to be married.

123
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,310
你什么都了解
You understand everything.

124
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,490
黑根先生，谢谢
Mr. Hagen. Thank you.

125
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,930
等着瞧我为你女儿做的漂亮结婚蛋糕
And wait till you see the beautiful wedding cake I made for your daughter.

126
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,430
这么高… 还有新娘新郎和天使…
Like this, with the bride and the groom and the angles--

127
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,050
- 这件事我该交给谁去办？ - 不要给我们的人
- Who should I give this job to? - Not to our paisan.

128
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,170
给别的区的犹太众议员
Give it to a Jew congressman in another district.

129
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,340
名单上还有谁？
Who else is on the list?

130
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,880
- 哟  - 嗨，迈克尔，你好吗
-Yo -Hey, Michael. How are you?

131
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:55,680
你好
Hello.

132
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,640
他不在名单上，但卢卡・布拉西想要见你
He's not on the list, but Luca Brasi wants to see you.

133
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,960
这个…有这个必要吗？
Is this...Is this necessary?

134
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,880
他没料到会受邀参加婚礼，所以要向你致谢
He didn't expect to be invited to the wedding so he wanted to thank you.

135
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,540
好吧
All right.

136
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:36,710

祝愿他们第一个孩子是个男孩

139
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,150
- 阁下…  - 迈克尔
- Don-- - Michael?

140
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,290
唐・柯利昂尼
Don Corleone--

141
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,610
那边那个人在自言自语
That man over there is talking to himself.

142
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,110
看到那边那个吓人的家伙了吗？

143
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,140
他是个很吓人的家伙

144
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,920
他是谁？叫什么名字？
Well, who is he? What's his name?

145
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,120
他名叫卢卡・布拉西
His name is Luca Brasi...

146
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,620
他有时候替我父亲办事
and he helps my father out sometimes.

147
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,670
哦，迈克尔，等一下  他过来了
Oh, Michael, wait a minute. He's coming over here.

148
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,310
迈克尔
Michael

149
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,470
汤姆
Tom

150
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,750
你气色好极了
You look terrific!

151
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,050
我哥哥汤姆・黑根  这是凯伊・亚当斯
My brother Tom Hagen. This is Kay Adams.

152
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,850
- 你好吗，汤姆  - 你好吗，幸会
- How do you do, Tom? - How do you do? Nice to meet you.

153
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,070
你父亲一直在问你
Your father's been asking for you.

154
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,640
- 很高兴见到你  - 幸会  - 我会去的，汤姆
- Very nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - I'll be there, Tom.

155
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,430
他是你哥哥的话，他为何会有不一样的姓氏？
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?

156
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,860
哦，我哥哥桑尼小时候…
Oh, eh, when my brother Sonny was a kid...

157
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:32,430
在街上发现汤姆・黑根，无家可归
he found Tom Hagen in the street, and he had no home.

158
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,180
所以我父亲接纳了他
So my father took him in...

159
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,330
从此他就和我们住在一起了
and he's been with us ever since.

160
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,520
他是个好律师
He's a good lawyer.

161
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,130
不是西西里人，不过…
Not a Sicilian, but...

162
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,800
我想他会当consigliere
I think he's gonna be consigliere.

163
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,310
- 那是什么？  - 那是…
- What's that? - That's...

164
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:53,120
像是个顾问、建言者，在家族中非常重要
like a counselor, an advisor. Very important to the family.

165
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,710
喜欢这烤宽面吗？
You like your lasagna?

166
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,750
唐・柯利昂尼
Don Corleone

167
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,810
我深感荣幸与感激

168
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:10,760
你邀请我来到你女儿的婚礼

在令媛结婚的当天

我祝愿他们的第一个孩子，是一个男孩

171
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:31,010
我献上我永无止境的忠诚

172
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,910
给令媛的新娘贺礼

谢谢你，卢卡，我最珍贵的朋友

唐・柯利昂尼，我先告退了，因为我知道你忙
Don Corleone, I'm gonna leave you now... because I know you are busy.

175
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,520
谢谢
Thank you.

176
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:36,190
柯利昂尼夫人
Signora Corleone

177
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,960
不…
No, no, no.

178
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,920
科利参议员为不能亲自前来而道歉
Senator Cauly apologized for not coming personally...

179
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,920
他说你会谅解的
but said you'd understand.

180
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,380
有些法官也一样
Also some of the judges.

181
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,780
他们都送了礼物
They've all sent gifts.

182
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,690
外面是怎么回事？
What is that outside?

183
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:16,810
约翰尼
Johnny!

184
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,840
我爱你
I love you.

185
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,960
他大老远从加州赶来参加婚礼
He came all the way from California to come to the wedding.

186
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,080
我告诉过你他会来的
I told you he was going to come.

187
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,310
已经两年了，他也许又有麻烦了
It's been two years. He's probably in trouble again.

188
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,920
他是个好教子
He's a good godson.

189
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:42,990
约翰尼…唱首歌
Sing a song.

190
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,310
迈克尔，你从未告诉我你认识约翰尼・方廷
Michael, you never told me you knew Johnny Fontane.

191
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,630
- 当然，你想见他吗？  - 啊？是的，当然
-Sure. You wanna meet him? -Huh? Oh, well, sure.

192
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,540
我父亲帮他建立他的事业
My father helped him with his career.

193
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:07,840
是吗？
He did?

194
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,300
怎么做的？
How?

195
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,320
- 我们听听这首歌  - 不，迈克尔
- Let's listen to the song. - No, Michael

196
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,820
拜托，迈克尔，告诉我
Please, Michael. Tell me.

197
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:58,500
约翰尼刚出道时 签了一份私人服务合同
When Johnny was first starting out he was signed to this personal service contract

198
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,100
跟一个大乐队的领班
with a big bandleader.

199
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,270
随着他的事业越来越好，他想要摆脱它
And as his career got better and better...he wanted to get out of it.

200
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,630
约翰尼是我父亲的教子
Now, Johnny is my father's godson...

201
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,310
于是…我父亲去见这个乐队领班
and my father went to see this bandleader...

202
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,730
给他开价1万美元，放约翰尼走
and he offered him $10,000 to let Johnny go.

203
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,810
但这个领班说不行
But the bandleader said no.

204
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,680
所以第二天…
So the next day

205
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:26,310
我父亲再去见他 只是这次带着卢卡・布拉西
my father went to see him...only this time with Luca Brasi.

206
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,410
一个小时之内
And within an hour,

207
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,530
他签了一份解约书
he signed a release...

208
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:36,130
收下1千美元的保付支票
for a certified check of $1,000.

209
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,920
他怎么办到的？
How'd he do that?

210
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,740
我父亲给他开了个不能拒绝的条件
My father made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

211
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,630
是什么条件？
What was that?

212
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,340
卢卡・布拉西拿一支枪对着他的头
Luca Brasi held a gun to his head...

213
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,210
而我父亲跟他保证…
and my father assured him

214
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,650
要么是他的脑浆，要么是他的签字会落在合同上
that either his brains...or his signature would be on the contract.

215
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,110
这是个真实的故事
That's a true story.

216
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:14,730
那是我的家庭，凯伊，不是我
That's my family, Kay. It's not me.

217
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,430
谁给我教子来杯酒？
Who get my godson a glass of wine?

218
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,410
我会处理的
I'll take care of it.

219
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,680
汤姆
Tom.

220
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,410
我要你去找桑提诺，叫他到办公室来
I want you to find Santino. Tell him to come to the office.

221
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,040
你好吗，弗雷多？
How are you, Fredo?

222
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,510
弗雷多
Fredo.

223
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,310
我哥哥弗雷多，这位是凯伊・亚当斯
My brother Fredo. This is Kay Adams.

224
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,950
- 嗨  - 你好吗？
- Hi. - How ya doin'?

225
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,810
- 这是我弟弟迈克尔  - 你玩得愉快吗？
- This is my brother Mike. - Are you having a good time?

226
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,040
对，这是你的朋友？
Yeah. This is your friend, huh?

227
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,840
我不知道该怎么办
I don't know what to do.

228
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,140
我的嗓子很弱  很虚弱
My voice is weak. It's weak.

229
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:43,810
总之，如果我能得到那部电影的那个角色
Anyway, if I had this part in the picture, you know...

230
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:46,610
它会让我再次回到顶峰
it puts me right back up on top again.

231
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,310
但是这个…
But this...

232
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,310
这个人拦着，他不给我这角色，电影公司的老板
this man out there, he won't give it to me. The head of the studio.

233
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,340
- 他叫什么名字？  - 沃茨，沃茨，他…
- What's his name? - Woltz.

234
00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:00,210
他不愿意给我，他还说没有机会，没有机会
He won't give it to me... and he says there's no chance, no chance.

235
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:04,680
桑尼？
Sonny?

236
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:07,880
桑尼？
Sonny?

237
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,580
桑尼？
Sonny?

238
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,130
桑尼，你在里面吗？
Sonny, you in there?

239
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,320
什么事？
What?

240
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,310
老头子要见你
The old man wants to see you.

241
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,460
好，就一分钟
Yeah, one minute.

242
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,310
桑尼
Sonny

243
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,850
一个月以前，他…
A month ago, he...

244
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,310
买下这本书的电影版权，一本畅销书
bought the movie rights to this book. A best-seller.

245
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:47,360
男主角正好是一个我这样的人，唉…
And the main character is a guy just like me. Why...

246
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:50,450
我连演都不用演，只要当我自己就行
I wouldn't even have to act. Just be myself.

247
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:54,310
噢…教父，我不知道该怎么办，我不知道该怎么办
Oh, Godfather, I don't know what to do.

248
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,110
你可以像个男人一样行事
You can act like a man!

249
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,010
你怎么搞的？
What's the matter with you?

250
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,560
你就成了这样一个好莱坞娘炮？
Is this how you turned out? A Hollywood finocchio that...

251
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,310
哭得像个女人？
that cries like a woman?

252
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:08,180
“我该怎么办？我该怎么办？”
"What can I do?" "What can I do?"

253
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,620
这是什么胡话？
What is that nonsense?

254
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,410
荒唐
Ridiculous!

255
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:19,110
- 你花时间陪家人吗？  - 我当然有
- You spend time with your family? - Sure I do.

256
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,460
很好
Good.

257
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,110
因为不花时间陪家人的男人，永远成不了真正的男人
Because the man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man.

258
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,340
过来
Come here.

259
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,430
你看来糟透了
You look terrible.

260
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,310
我要你多吃点
I want you to eat.

261
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:37,410
我要你好好休息，从现在起一个月后，这个…
I want you to rest well, and a month from now this...

262
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,190
好莱坞大亨，会如你所愿的
Hollywood big shot's gonna give you what you want.

263
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:42,810
太迟了，他们一周内就要开拍了
Too late. They start shooting in a week.

264
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,770
我会给他提一个无法拒绝的条件
I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.

265
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,970
现在到外面去好好玩，还有…
Now just go outside, enjoy yourself and...

266
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,210
- 忘掉这些鬼话吧  - 好的
- forget about all this nonsense. - All right.

267
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:58,160
听着，我要你全都留给我来办
Listen. I want you to leave it all to me.

268
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,310
好的
All right.

269
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:27,010
我女儿什么时候跟新郎离开？
What time does my daughter leave with the bridegroom?

270
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,040
切完蛋糕后的几分钟
In a few minutes, right after they cut the cake.

271
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:33,650
你的新女婿，要给他重要职务吗？
Now, your new son-in-law, we give him something important.

272
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:34,580
永远不要
Never.

273
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:38,750
给他个活计，但永远别跟他谈论家族生意
Give him a living but never discuss the family business with him.

274
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,110
还有别的吗？
What else?

275
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,030
维吉尔・索洛佐来过电话
Virgil Sollozzo called.

276
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,180
我们必须给他留出下周某一天来
We have to give him a day sometime next week.

277
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,850
等你从加州回来我们再讨论
We'll discuss him when you come back from California.

278
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,710
我何时去加州？
When am I going to California?

279
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,430
我要你今晚去
I want you to go tonight.

280
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,310
我要你跟这个…
I want you to talk to this...

281
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,980
电影大亨谈谈，解决约翰尼的事
movie big shot and settle this business for Johnny.

282
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:01,190
要是没有其它事，我要去参加我女儿的婚礼了
If there's nothing else, I'd like to go to my daughter's wedding.

283
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,630
卡洛，我们要拍照了
Carlo, we're gonna take the picture.

284
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,810
等一下
Wait a minute.

285
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,780
不，迈克尔，我不行
No, Michael, not me.

286
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,710
好了，稍微靠近点
Okay, just a little closer.

287
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:19,750
好了，就是这样，别动
Okay, that's it. Just like that now. Hold it.

288
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,110
好了，开始说吧
All right, start talking.

289
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:16,220
我是约翰尼・方廷的一个朋友派来的
I was sent by a friend of Johnny Fontane.

290
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,210
这个朋友是我的客户
This friend is my client...

291
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,530
他将给予沃茨先生永恒的友谊
and would give his undying friendship to Mr. Woltz

292
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:23,310
只要沃茨先生给我们帮个小忙
if Mr. Woltz would grant us a small favor.

293
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,650
沃茨听着呢
Woltz is listening.

294
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:30,210
把你下周开拍那部战争片里的那个角色给约翰尼
Give Johnny the part in that new war film you're starting next week.

295
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:40,710
那么…你的朋友会给沃茨先生帮什么忙呢？
And... what favor would your friend grant Mr. Woltz?

296
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:44,010
你将会有些工会的麻烦，我的客户能消弭它们
You're gonna have some union problems. My client could make them disappear.

297
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:47,710
另外，你的一个顶级明星刚从大麻改用海洛因了
Also, one of your top stars has just moved from marijuana to heroin.

298
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:49,440
你是在要挟我吗？
Are you trying to muscle me?

299
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,310
- 绝对没有  - 好了，你听好了
- Absolutely not. - Now, look, listen to me.

300
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,760
你这个油腔滑调的王八蛋
you smooth-talking son of a bitch!

301
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:55,540
让我跟你和你的老板说清楚，不管他是谁
Let me lay it on the line for you and your boss, whoever he is!

302
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,580
约翰尼・方廷绝对拿不到那部电影
Johnny Fontane will never get that movie.

303
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:02,170
我不管有多少老西、老意、南欧人什么的冒出来
I don't care how many dago, guinea, wop...greaseball goombahs come outta the woodwork.

304
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:03,330
我是德裔爱尔兰人
I'm German-Irish.

305
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,910
那我告诉你，德国泡菜老兄
Well, let me tell you something, my kraut mick friend.

306
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,780
我要好好收拾你，你都不知道打击来自何方
I'm ganna make so much trouble for you, you won't know what hit you.

307
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,650
沃茨先生，我是个律师，我不是来威胁…
Mr. Woltz, I'm a lawyer. I have not threatened--

308
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:13,540
我认识几乎每一个纽约的大律师，你是什么东西？
I know almost every big lawyer in New York. Who the hell are you?

309
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:17,030
我的执业情况特别，只处理一位客户
I have a special practice. I handle one client.

310
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,110
你有我的电话号码，我等你电话
Now, you have my number. I'll wait for your call.

311
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:24,710
对了，我很赞赏你的电影
By the way, I admire your pictures very much.

312
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,410
查清他底细
Check him out.

313
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,590
真是美极了
This is really beautiful.

314
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,940
看看这个，原本是用来装饰某个国王的宫殿的
Look at this. Used to decorate the palace of a king.

315
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:00,460
哦是啊，很漂亮
Oh, yeah. Very nice.

316
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,740
你怎么不说你是给柯利昂尼办事的，汤姆？
Why didn't you just say you worked for Corleone, Tom?

317
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,050
我以为你不过是个廉价的小骗子
I thought you were just some cheap, two-bit hustler...

318
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,100
约翰尼弄来诈唬我的
Johnny was running in, trying to bluff me.

319
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,620
我不想用他的名字，除非真的必要
I don't like to use his name unless it's really necessary.

320
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,430
- 你的酒怎么样，汤姆？  - 很好
- How's your drink, Tom? - Fine.

321
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,080
到这边来，我给你看一样真正漂亮的东西
Come with me. I want to show you something really beautiful.

322
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:16,770
你是个识货的人，对吧汤姆？
You do appreciate beauty, don't you, Tom?

323
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:22,940
就是它，60万美元的四蹄动物
There you are. $600,000 on four hooves.

324
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:26,710
我打赌俄国沙皇也从未在一匹马身上花过这么大笔钱
I'll bet Russian czars never paid that kind of dough for a single horse.

325
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,210
喀土穆
Khartoum.

326
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,810
喀土穆
Khartoum.

327
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,720
不过我不会用他来比赛
I'm not gonna race him, though.

328
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:37,310
我要他当种马
I'm gonna put him out to stud.

329
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,410
- 谢谢，托尼 - 不必客气
- Thanks, Tony. - You're welcome.

330
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,010
- 走吧  - 我们去吃点东西
- Come on. - Let's get something to eat.

331
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,620
柯利昂尼先生，是约翰尼的教父
Mr. Corleone is Johnny's godfather.

332
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:51,250
对意大利人而言，这是非常虔诚、庄严、紧密的关系
To the Italian people, that's a very religious, sacred, close relationship.

333
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,520
这我尊重
I respect that.

334
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:55,110
告诉他 他可以跟我要求任何别的事
Just tell him he should ask me anything else.

335
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,440
但就这一个人情我不能给他
This is one favor I can't give him.

336
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,330
他被拒绝一次后 不会再要求第二次
He never asks a second favor when he's been refused the first.

337
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,100
- 明白吗？  - 是你不明白
- Understood? - You don't understand.

338
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,700
约翰尼・方廷永远拿不到那部电影
Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.

339
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,820
那个角色完美契合他
That part is perfect for him.

340
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,910
会让他成为巨星
It'll make him a big star.

341
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,830
我要把他赶出这一行
I'm gonna run him out of the business.

342
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,650
我来告诉你为什么
Let me tell you why.

343
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:21,830
约翰尼・方廷毁了一个沃茨国际最有价值的新人
Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz International's most valuable proteges.

344
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:24,340
五年来我们不断地训练她
For five years, we had her under training.

345
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,390
歌唱课、表演课、跳舞课
Singing lessons, acting lessons, dancing lessons.

346
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:29,660
我在她身上花费了成千上万的金钱
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on her.

347
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,910
我要让她成为一位巨星
I was gonna make her a big star.

348
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:34,910
我还可以更坦白些
And let me be even more frank.

349
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:39,910
让你看看我不是铁石心肠，这也不全是钱的事
Just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man that it's not all dollars and cents.

350
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,640
她人漂亮  她年轻而又单纯
She was beautiful. She was young, she was innocent!

351
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:46,080
她有着我曾拥有过最棒的屁股
She was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had

352
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:48,310
我可是占有过全世界各种美臀的人
and I've had 'em all over the world.

353
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,430
然后约翰尼・方廷出现了
And then Johnny Fontane comes along...

354
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:55,450
带着橄榄油的嗓音和意大利风情
with his olive oil voice and guinea charm.

355
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,510
然后她就跑掉了
And she runs off.

356
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:02,330
她丢下一切，令我成为笑柄
She threw it all away just to make me look ridiculous...

357
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:07,860
而我这种地位的人受不了被当作笑柄
and a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous!

358
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,210
现在你给我滚出去
Now you get the hell outta here!

359
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:12,460
要是那个黑手党想来硬的
And if that goombah tries any rough stuff...

360
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:15,430
你告诉他，我不是乐队领班
you tell him I ain't no bandleader.

361
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:19,760
对，我听说过那个故事
Yeah. I heard that story.

362
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,770
谢谢你的晚餐以及非常愉快的一晚
Thank you for the dinner and a very pleasant evening.

363
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,520
也许你的车能送我去机场
If your car could take me to the airport...

364
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:30,870
柯利昂尼先生是个坚持立刻听到坏消息的人
Mr. Corleone is a man who insists on hearing bad news immediately.

365
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,910
- 你不会太累吧，汤姆？  - 我在飞机上睡过了
- You're not too tired, are you, Tom? - No, I slept on the plane.

366
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:29,430
我这里有索洛佐的资料
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

367
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,240
是这样…
Now...

368
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,640
索洛佐，绰号“土耳其人”
Sollozzo is known as "The Turk."

369
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:39,210
他应该很善于用刀
He's supposed to be very good with a knife...

370
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:43,410
但只用在生意上，出于某种合理纠纷时
but only in matters of business with some sort of reasonable complaint.

371
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:46,610
他的生意是麻醉毒品
his business is narcotics.

372
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,310
他在土耳其有田地，在那里种罂粟
he has fields in Turkey where they grow the poppy...

373
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:54,260
在西西里他有工厂提炼成海洛因
and in Sicily he has the plants to process them into heroin.

374
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,420
现在，他需要现金
Now, he needs cash...

375
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:00,090
而且他需要来自警方的保护，为此他会分一份出来
and he needs protection from the police for which he gives a piece of the action.

376
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,170
我没能查出是多少
I couldn't find out how much.

377
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:05,070
塔塔利亚家族在纽约这边是他的后台
The Tattaglia family is behind him here in New York.

378
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,960
他们一定也有份
Now, they have to be in it for something.

379
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,460
桑提诺・柯利昂尼
Santino Corleone.

380
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,260
他的坐牢记录如何？
What about his prison record?

381
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,820
两次，一次在意大利，一次在这里
Two terms, one in Italy, one here.

382
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:16,030
他被认为是顶级毒枭
He's known as a top narcotics man.

383
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,730
桑提诺，你怎么想的？
Santino, what do you think?

384
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:21,750
白粉可以赚大钱
There's a lot of money in that white powder.

385
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,210
汤姆？
Tom?

386
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,010
我赞成，毒品比其它任何东西赚钱潜力都大
I say yes, there's more money potential in narcotics than anything else we're looking at.

387
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,430
就算我们不加入，别人也会
If we don't get into it, somebody else will.

388
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,910
也许是五大家族之一，也许他们全体
Maybe one of the five families, maybe all of them.

389
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,310
用他们赚到的钱，他们能买通更多警察和政治力量
With the money they earn they can buy more police and political power.

390
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:40,330
到时他们就能紧跟我们
Then they come after us.

391
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,220
现在我们有工会，我们有赌博
Now we have the unions, we have the gambling...

392
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:47,170
它们是最好的东西，但毒品，是未来的翘楚
and they're the best things to have, but narcotics...is a thing of the future.

393
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,720
如果我们不从中分一份
If we don't get a piece of that action...

394
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,050
我们就有失去一切的风险
we risk everything we have.

395
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:53,140
我不是指现在，而是从现在起十年之内
I mean not now, but ten years from now.

396
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,240
怎么样？
So?

397
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:00,440
你的回答是什么呢，爸爸？
What's your answer gonna be, Pop?

398
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:07,250
唐・柯利昂尼
Don Corleone

399
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:11,680
我需要一个有强大朋友的人
I need a man who has powerful friends.

400
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,320
我需要一百万元的现金
I need a million dollars in cash.

401
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:18,350
我需要你口袋里掌握的政客，唐・柯利昂尼
I need, Don Corleone, those politicians you carrying in your pocket...

402
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,410
就像许许多多零钱硬币
Like so many nickels and dimes.

403
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:24,110
我的家族有何利益？
What is the interest for my family?

404
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,670
30%
Thirty percent.

405
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:29,760
第一年你就可进帐三四百万元
In the first year, your end should be 3, 4 million dollars.

406
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,050
然后还会增加
And then it would go up.

407
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:36,310
塔塔利亚家族又有何利益？
And what is the interest for the Tattaglia family?

408
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,420
佩服
My compliments.

409
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:47,520
我来操心塔塔利亚家，从我那份里出
I'll take care of the Tattaglias outta my share.

410
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:51,630
那么，我得30%，提供财务支持…
So, I receive 30% for finance...

411
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:55,500
政治影响力和法律保护，这就是你说的
political influence and legal protection, that's what you telling me.

412
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,630
正是
That's right.

413
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,950
你为什么来找我？
Why do you come to me?

414
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:02,540
我为什么值得你这么慷慨？
Why do I deserve this generosity?

415
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:07,520
如果你把一百万现金仅仅视为“财务支持”…
If you consider a million dollars in cash...just "finance"--

416
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:10,650
我向你致敬[意大利语]  唐・柯利昂尼

417
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:23,310
我说我会见你是因为…
I said that I would see you because...

418
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,840
我听说你是个认真的人
I heard that you were a serious man...

419
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,370
应该以礼相待
to be treated with respect.

420
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,120
但是…
But...

421
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,620
我必须对你说不
I must say no to you.

422
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,690
而且我要告诉你我的理由
And I'll give you my reason.

423
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,600
没错，我有很多政界的朋友
It's true, I have a lot of friends in politics.

424
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:46,020
但他们的朋友做不了多久…
But they wouldn't be friendly very long...

425
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,940
一旦他们知道我的生意是毒品而非赌博的话
if they knew my business was drugs instead of gambling...

426
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:52,180
他们将之看作是无害的恶习
which they regard as a harmless vice.

427
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:54,620
- 但毒品则是肮脏的生意  - 不，唐・柯利昂尼…
- But drugs is a dirty business. - No, Don Corleone--

428
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,550
这对我并没有什么区别
It doesn't make any difference to me...

429
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,460
一个人做什么为生，你能理解的
what a man does for a living, you understand...

430
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,730
但你的生意就…
but your business is...

431
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,830
有一点危险
a little dangerous.

432
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:07,520
如果你是担心你那一百万的安全
If you're worried about security for your million...

433
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,420
塔塔利亚家会做担保
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

434
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,970
你是说塔塔利亚家会担保我们的投资…
You're tellin' me the Tattaglias guarantee our investment--

435
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,510
等一下
Wait a minute.

436
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:25,030
我的弱点是对孩子们太溺爱，你看我把他们宠坏了
I have a sentimental weakness for my children and I spoil them, as you can see.

437
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,910
他们在应该听话时说话
They talk when they should listen.

438
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,340
但是，不管怎样
But, anyway

439
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:31,410
索洛佐先生，我的“不”是最终决定
Signor Sollozzo, my "no" is final...

440
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:34,210
我要恭喜你的新生意
and I wish to congratulate you on your new business.

441
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,460
我知道你会很成功，祝你好运
I know you'll do very well, and good luck to you...

442
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:41,120
尤其是你的生意跟我的并不冲突
especially since your interests don't conflict with mine.

443
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,060
谢谢
Thank you.

444
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,840
桑提诺
Santino

445
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,920
过来
Come here.

446
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,910
你怎么回事？
What's the matter with you?

447
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,910
我看你的脑子是变迟钝了
I think your brain is going soft...

448
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:15,630
自从你跟那个年轻姑娘的小喜剧上演以来
from all that comedy you're playing with that young girl.

449
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:19,930
再也不要告诉家族以外的人你在想什么了
Never tell anybody outside the family what you're thinking again.

450
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,730
去吧
Go on.

451
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:29,360
汤姆，这是…什么乱七八糟的
Tom, what-- What is this nonsense?

452
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,890
是约翰尼送的，他主演了那部新电影
It's from Johnny. He's starring in that new film.

453
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,430
好吧，把它拿走
Well, take it away.

454
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,850
把它拿那边去
Take it over there.

455
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:40,650
还有
And...

456
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:44,360
叫卢卡・布拉西来
tell Luca Brasi to come in.

457
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,210
我对索洛佐这人有点担心
I'm a little worried about this Sollozzo fellow.

458
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,640
我要你弄清楚他在耍什么把戏
I want you to find out what he's got under his fingernails, you know.

459
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:01,250
到塔塔利亚那边去
Go to the Tattaglias and...

460
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:06,410
让他们以为你与我们家族不融洽
make them think...that you're not too happy with our family...

461
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:09,760
尽量查些东西出来
and find out what you can.

462
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:30,070
我买了…我买了东西给你母亲，还有桑尼
And I got something...I got something for your mother and for Sonny...

463
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:34,540
还有一条领带给弗雷多，汤姆・黑根是雷诺兹钢笔
and a tie for Freddy...and Tom Hagen got the Reynolds pen.

464
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:39,240
- 你圣诞节想要什么？  - 我？哦，只要你
- What do you want for Christmas? - Me? Oh, just you.

465
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,440
醒醒[意大利语]弗雷多

466
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:13,850
叫泡利备车，我们要走了
Tell Paulie to get the car. We're going.

467
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,010
好的，爸
Okay, Pa.

468
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:19,360
我得自己去开车，爸，泡利今早打电话说病了
I'll have to get it myself, Pa. Paulie called in sick this morning.

469
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:24,180
泡利是个好孩子，我不介意去开车
Paulie's a good kid. I don't mind gettin' the car.

470
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:30,700
（意大利语）

471
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,850
卢卡

我是布鲁诺・塔塔利亚
I am Bruno Tattaglia.

473
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,250
我知道

474
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:20,130
（意大利语）威士忌？战前的
...Scotch? Prewar.

475
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,210
我不喝酒[意大利语]

476
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,310
你知道我是谁吗？
You know who I am?

477
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,090
我认识你[意大利语]

478
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:34,110
你一直在跟塔塔利亚家族谈，对吧？[意大利语]

479
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,790
我认为你跟我可以做生意[意大利语]

480
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,010
我需要像你这么强壮的人[意大利语]

481
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:49,420
我听说你…与柯利昂尼家族不和[意大利语]

482
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,840
想加入我们吗？[意大利语]

我能得到什么好处[意大利语]

484
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:00,710
五万元，只是起步[意大利语]

485
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,650
不坏[意大利语]

486
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,510
同意了？[意大利语]

487
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:10,780
哦，汤姆・黑根，圣诞快乐
Ah, Tom Hagen, Merry Christmas.

488
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:13,810
我很高兴遇见你，我想跟你聊聊
I'm glad I run into you. I wanna talk to you.

489
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:15,410
我没时间
I haven't got time.

490
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,760
腾出点时间吧，consigliere，上车
Oh, make time, consigliere. Get in the car.

491
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:22,210
你担心什么？
What are you worried about?

492
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:24,920
我想杀你的话你早己死了
If I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead already.

493
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:26,740
上车
Get in.

494
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,570
等一下，弗雷多，我买点水果
Fredo, I'm gonna buy some fruit.

495
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:41,810
好的，爸
Okay, Pa.

496
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:52,040
圣诞快乐 我要买些水果
Hi. Merry Christmas.I want some fruit over there.

497
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:58,080
给我三个
Gimme three of them.

498
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,630
不，那个
No, that one.

499
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:20,750
弗雷多
Fredo!

500
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:21,950
弗雷多
Fredo!

501
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,090
爸爸
Papa.

502
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,450
迈克，我要是修女你会不会更喜欢我？
Mike, would you like me better if I were a nun...

503
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,110
就像这个故事里那样
like in the story, you know?

504
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:26,960
不会
No

505
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:29,840
那如果我是英格丽・褒曼 你会不会更喜欢我？
Then would you like me better if I were Ingrid Bergman?

506
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:32,130
这个想法不错
Now that's a thought.

507
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:35,220
迈克尔
Michael

508
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:38,840
不，如果你是英格丽・褒曼，我不会更喜欢你的
No, I would not like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman.

509
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:41,140
- 迈克尔  - 怎么回事？
- Mike-- - What's the matter?

510
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:59,630
他们没说他是死是活
They don't say if he's dead or alive.

511
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,530
桑尼，我是迈克尔
Sonny, Michael.

512
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:25,430
迈克尔，你到哪去了？
Michael, where you been?

513
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:26,840
他还好吗？
Is he all right?

514
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:30,670
我们还不知道，各种说法都有
We don't know yet. There's all kinds of stories.

515
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:33,320
他伤得很重，麦基
he was hit bad, Mikey.

516
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:35,410
你还在吗？
Are you there?

517
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,400
是的，我在
Yeah, I'm here.

518
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:39,340
你去哪儿了？我很担心
Where you been? I was worried.

519
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:41,960
汤姆没告诉你我打过电话吗？
Didn't Tom tell you I called?

520
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:44,170
没，快回家，小子
No. Look, come home, kid.

521
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:46,110
你应该在这里陪妈妈，听见没？
You should be with Mama, you hear?

522
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:47,520
好的
All right.

523
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:55,810
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

524
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,460
桑尼
Sonny.

525
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:11,150
待在后面，快去
Stay back there. Go.

526
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:15,550
- 是谁？  - 开门，我是克里门萨
- Who is it?  - Open up. It's Clemenza.

527
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,960
- 什么事？  - 有更多你老子的消息
- What?  - There's more news about your old man.

528
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:22,620
街头谣传他已经死了
The word is out on the street he's already dead.

529
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:24,530
闭上你的嘴，你怎么回事？
Shut your mouth. What's the matter with you?

530
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,930
老天爷，桑尼，别激动，别激动
Jesus Christ! Sonny, take it easy. Take it easy.

531
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:28,430
泡利在哪？
Where was Paulie?

532
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:30,860
泡利病假了，他整个冬天都病了
Paulie was out sick. He's been sick all winter.

533
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,060
他病了几次？
How many times he been sick?

534
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:33,550
只有大概三四次
Only maybe three, four times.

535
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,630
- 我问过弗雷迪要不要另找个保镖  - 听着
- I mean I asked Freddy if he wants a different bodyguard. - Listen

536
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,840
- 他说不用  - 去带他来，帮我个忙
- He said no. - Pick him up. Do me a favor

537
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:38,330
立刻去带他来，我不管他病多重
pick him up right now. I don't care how sick he is.

538
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,980
只要他在喘气，我要你带他到我父亲的房子去
If he's breathin', I want you to bring him to my father's house now.

539
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:42,140
明白吗？现在
understand? Now.

540
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:43,530
好，你要我派人过来吗？
Yeah, you want me to send people here?

541
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:45,520
- 不不，只要你和他，去吧  - 好
- No, just you and him. Go ahead. - All right.

542
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,530
我会叫几个我们的人到家里来
I'm havin' a couple of our people come to the house.

543
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,560
- 你好  - 桑提诺・柯利昂尼吗？
-Hello? -Santino Corleone?

544
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:06,460
- 是我  - 我们抓了汤姆・黑根
-Yeah. -We have Tom hagen.

545
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,850
约三小时后，他会被释放，带回我们的提议
In about three hours, he'll be released with our proposition.

546
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,710
你做任何事之前，先听听他要说的话
Listen to everything he has to say before you do anything.

547
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:15,310
事情已然发生
What's done is done.

548
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,340
别发你那著名的臭脾气，行吗，桑尼？
And don't lose that famous temper of yours, huh, Sonny?

549
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:20,320
好，我会等
No, I'll wait.

550
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,310
你的老板死了
Your boss is dead.

551
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:41,610
我知道你在家族中不是负责武力的，汤姆
I know you're not in the muscle end of the family, Tom.

552
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,810
所以我不想要你害怕
so I don't want you to be scared.

553
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,850
我要你帮助柯利昂尼家族
I want you to help the Corleones...

554
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:49,640
我还要你帮我
and I want you to help me.

555
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,310
对，我们在他办公室外干掉了他
Yeah, we got him outside his office...

556
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:57,210
就在我们接了你大约一小时之后
just about an hour after we picked you up.

557
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,110
喝吧
Drink it.

558
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:08,660
所以现在全靠你为我跟桑尼达成和平了
So now it's up to you to make the peace between me and Sonny.

559
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,040
桑尼热心我的交易，不是吗？
Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?

560
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:19,080
你也知道那么做是对的
And you knew it was the right thing to do.

561
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:23,310
桑尼会动用一切来追杀你
Sonny will come after you with everything he's got.

562
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,460
那会是他的第一个反应，的确
That'll be his first reaction, sure.

563
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:29,510
所以你得跟他讲讲道理
That's why you gotta talk some sense into him.

564
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:33,510
塔塔利亚家族全体都是我的后盾
The Tattaglia family is behind me with all their people.

565
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,810
纽约其它的家族…
The other New York families

566
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:38,340
会不惜一切防止全面战争
will go along with anything that will prevent a full-scale war.

567
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:41,580
我们面对现实吧，汤姆，恕我直言
Let's face it, Tom. I'm all due respect...

568
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:45,320
唐，愿他安息，已经松懈了
the Don, rest in peace, was slippin'.

569
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,020
十年前我能对付他吗？
Ten years ago, could I have gotten to him?

570
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,240
但现在他已经死了
Well, now he's dead.

571
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:58,670
他死了，汤姆，什么也不能让他复生
He's dead, Tom, and nothing can bring him back.

572
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:01,660
所以你得跟桑尼谈
So you gotta talk to Sonny.

573
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:06,710
你得跟两个头目谈，泰西欧，胖子克里门萨
You gotta talk to the caporegimes-- that Tessio, that fat Clemenza.

574
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:12,950
这是一门好生意，汤姆
It's good business, Tom.

575
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:15,610
我试试看
I'll try.

576
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:19,760
但即便是桑尼也没能力叫卢卡・布拉西停下
But even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.

577
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,840
是啊，这个…
Yeah. Well--

578
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,940
让我来操心卢卡
Let me worry about Luca.

579
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:35,310
你只管跟桑尼谈
You just talk to Sonny.

580
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:37,710
还有另外两个孩子
And the other two kids.

581
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:42,310
我尽力而为
I'll do my best.

582
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:43,860
很好
Good.

583
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:46,610
现在…
Now

584
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,410
你可以走了
you can go.

585
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,650
我不喜欢暴力，汤姆
I don't like violence, Tom.

586
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,850
我是个生意人
I'm a businessman.

587
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:02,290
流血是一种大代价
Blood is a big expense.

588
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:24,910
他还活着
He's still alive.

589
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:28,720
他们打了他五枪，可他还活着
They hit him with five shots, and he's still alive!

590
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:30,860
这是我运气坏
Well, that's bad luck for me...

591
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:34,720
也是你运气坏，如果你达不成协议的话
and bad luck for you if you don't make that deal.

592
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:14,850
麦克
Mike.

593
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,850
你母亲在医院陪你父亲
Your mother's over in the hospital with your father.

594
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:23,410
看样子他能度过难关，谢天谢地
Looks like he's gonna pull through, thank God.

595
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:27,540
- 有好多人要对付  - 你认为如何？
- That's a lot of bad blood. - What do you think?

596
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:30,640
- 索洛佐，菲利普・塔塔利亚，布鲁诺・塔塔利亚  - 太过了，我觉得太过私怨
- Sollozzo, Philip Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon... - It's too far. I think it's too personal.

597
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,240
唐就会仔细考虑
The Don will consider this over.

598
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,920
- 你要杀了他们全部？  - 喂，别插手，麦基，拜托
- You gonna kill all those guys? - Hey, stay out of it, Mikey, do me a favor

599
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:38,310
索洛佐是关键，你除掉他，一切就顺了
Stay out of it, Mickey.-Sollozzo's the key. You get rid of him, everything falls into line.

600
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:41,080
卢卡呢？索洛佐好像不太担心卢卡
What about Luca? Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca.

601
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:44,400
不知道，如果卢卡出卖我们，我们就有大麻烦了
I don't know. If Luca sold out, we're in a lot of trouble.

602
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:46,000
相信我，大麻烦
Believe me, a lot of trouble.

603
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:48,330
有人能跟卢卡联系上吗？
Has anyone been able to get in touch with Luca?

604
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:50,420
我们试了一整夜，他也许在外留宿
We've been tryin' all night. He might be shacked up.

605
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:53,740
- 麦基，帮我个忙，打电话给卢卡  - 卢卡从不留宿，他总是办完事回家
-Hey, Mickey, do me a favor, try him again. -Luca never sleeps over with a broad.He always goes home when he's through.

606
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:59,620
汤姆，你是Consigliere
Well, Tom, you're consigliere.

607
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:02,460
要是老头子死了我们该怎么办？大吉大利
What do we do if the old man dies, God forbid?

608
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:04,860
要是我们失去老头子
If we lose the old man...

609
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:08,710
我们就会失去政界的联系以及一半的力量
we lose our political contacts and half our strength.

610
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:11,930
纽约其它的家族可能会联合支持索洛佐
The other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo...

611
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:14,720
为了避免长期破坏性战争
just to avoid a long destructive war.

612
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:16,950
这都快1946年了
This is almost 1946.

613
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,810
没有人想再流血了
Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.

614
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:21,310
如果你父亲死了
If your father dies...

615
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:24,710
你得达成协议，桑尼
you'll make the deal, Sonny.

616
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,850
你说来容易，汤姆，他不是你父亲
You know, that's easy for you to say, Tom. He's not your father.

617
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,510
对他来说，我跟你和麦克一样是儿子
I was as much a son to him as you or Mike.

618
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:35,610
什么事？
What is it?

619
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,310
喂，泡利，我记得跟你说过在外面守着
Hey, Paulie, I thought I told you to stay put.

620
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,470
守大门的人说，他们收到一个包裹
The guy at the gates, they say they got a package.

621
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,120
是吗？泰西欧，去看看是什么
Yeah? Tessio, go see what it is.

622
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:50,120
- 你要我待在附近？ - 对，待在附近
- You want me to hang around? - Yeah, hang around.

623
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:51,560
- 你还好吧？ - 是的，我挺好
- You all right? - Yeah, I'm fine.

624
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:54,700
是吗？冰箱里有吃的，你饿不饿？
Yeah? There's some food in the icebox. You hungry anything?

625
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:55,950
- 不，没事，谢谢  - 喝杯酒如何？
-No, it's all right. Thanks. - How 'bout a drink?

626
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,430
- 一小杯白兰地能让你舒服点  - 好的，当然
a cup of little brandy? That's good to sweat it out. - All right, sure.

627
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,540
- 去吧，孩子  - 那或许是个好主意  - 对，没错
- Go ahead. - That might be a good idea. - Yeah, right.

628
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:05,140
我要你马上处置那个狗娘养的
I want you to take care of that son of a bitch right away.

629
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:07,660
泡利出卖了老头子  那个混蛋[意大利语]
Paulie sold out the old man.

630
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:09,070
我不想再见到他
I don't wanna see him again.

631
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,990
把它当作你第一件待办事项，明白吗？
Make that first thing on your list, understand?

632
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:12,010
明白
Understood.

633
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:14,560
麦基，明天，你带几个人…
Hey, Mickey, tomorrow you get a couple of guys.

634
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:16,960
到卢卡的公寓去，四处转转，等他出现
Go to Luca's apartment. Hang around, wait for him to show up.

635
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,620
也许我们不该让迈克尔太直接涉入
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike mixed up in this too directly.

636
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:21,620
对
Yeah.

637
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:24,540
听着…
Listen...

638
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:27,430
待在家里守电话，那就是很大帮助了
hang around the house on the phone. It'll be a big help.

639
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,810
再试着打给卢卡，打吧
Try Luca again. Go ahead.

640
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:41,590
- 这是什么鬼？  - 那是西西里人的口信
- What the hell is this? - It's a Sicilian message.

641
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:44,510
那表示卢卡・布拉西与鱼同眠了
It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.

642
00:55:58,030 --> 00:56:00,240
- 我现在要走了  - 你今晚几点会回家？
- I'm goin' now. - What time you gonna be home tonight?

643
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:01,920
我不知道，也许会很晚
I don't know. Probably late.

644
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:08,570
- 别忘了坎诺里煎饼卷  - 好好好
- Don't forget the cannoli. - Yeah, yeah.

645
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:13,020
洛可，坐到另一边去
Rocco, sit on the other side.

646
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:14,810
你挡住后视镜了
You block the rearview mirror.

647
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:18,060
桑尼发狂了
Sonny's runnin' wild.

648
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,930
他已经在考虑睡床垫了
He's thinkin' of goin' to the mattresses already.

649
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:22,410
我们得在西区找个据点
We gotta find a spot over on the West Side.

650
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:25,910
你试试西43街309号
We'll try 309 West 43rd Street.

651
00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:27,830
你知道西区有什么好地方吗？
You know any good spots on the West Side?

652
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,540
嗯，我想一下
Yeah, I'll think about it.

653
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:30,910
你开车的时候想好吗？
Well, think about it while you're drivin', will you?

654
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,390
我还想这个月里到纽约去呢
I wanna hit New York sometime this month.

655
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:35,740
倒车出去时留意小孩子
And watch out for the kids when you're backin' out.

656
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:48,570
泡利，我要你到39街科洛桑托店里
Paulie, I want you to go down 39th Street. Colosanto's.

657
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:50,520
去买18个床垫给大伙儿睡
Pick up 18 mattresses for the guys to sleep.

658
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:51,810
然后把账单拿给我
I want you to bring me the bill.

659
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:54,870
- 好的，那一定…  - 不，要确保是干净的
- Yeah, all right, there must be... - No, make sure they're clean.

660
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,900
因为那些伙计们要在那里待很长时间，你知道
because Those guys are gonna be stuck up in there for a long time, you know.

661
00:56:57,910 --> 00:56:59,980
它们是干净的，他们告诉我消过毒的
They're clean. They told me they exterminate them.

662
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:02,120
消毒？用那个字很不好
"Exterminate"? That's a bad word to use.

663
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:03,650
消毒，听听这个家伙
Exterminate. Get this guy.

664
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:05,550
看看我们怎么来消灭你
See how we don't exterminate you.

665
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,590
- 真是好笑  - 泡利…
- Youse funny, or what? - Hey, Paulie?...

666
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:15,610
喂，靠边停车好吗？我要放水
Hey, pull over, will you? I gotta take a leak.

667
00:57:57,330 --> 00:57:58,560
留下枪
Leave the gun.

668
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:00,760
拿上坎诺里煎饼卷
Take the cannoli.

669
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:21,850
喂，麦克…喂，麦基…
Hey, Mike! Hey, Mickey!

670
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,140
在
Yeah?

671
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:26,050
有电话找你
You're wanted on the telephone.

672
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:33,860
- 是谁？  - 是个女孩
- Who is it? - It's some girl.

673
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,470
- 你好，凯伊  - 你父亲还好吗？
Hello, Kay?how's your father?

674
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:43,150
他很好，他能挺过来
He's good. He's gonna make it.

675
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:44,630
我爱你
I love you.

676
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:48,060
我爱你
I love you.

677
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:51,270
- 迈克尔？  - 是，我知道
- Michael? - Yeah, I know.

678
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:53,150
告诉我你爱我
Tell me you love me.

679
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,450
我不能说
I can't talk.

680
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:56,310
你不能说吗？
Can't you say it?

681
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:59,310
我们今晚见
Yeah, I'll see you tonight.

682
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:03,360
喂，麦基，你干嘛不告诉那好姑娘你爱她？
Hey, Mickey, why don't you tell that nice girl you love her?

683
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:05,260
我全心全意爱你
I love you with all o' my heart!

684
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:08,420
要是我不能快点再见到你，我会死的
If I don't see you again a-soon, I'm-a gonna die!

685
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:10,900
过来，孩子，学点东西
Come over here, kid. Learn somethin'.

686
00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:14,020
你永远不知道，有一天你也许得给20个男人做饭
You never know, you might have to cook for 20 guys someday.

687
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:17,900
看着，你开始先倒点油，然后炸大蒜
You see? You start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic.

688
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:21,020
然后扔进几个西红柿，番茄酱
Then you throw in some tomatoes, some tomato paste.

689
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,310
你得炒一下，让它别粘锅
You fry it. You make sure it doesn't stick.

690
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:27,530
煮开了之后，加入香肠及肉丸
When you got it to a boil, you shove in all your sausage and meatballs.

691
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,440
再加一点点酒
And a little bit of wine.

692
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:38,290
以及…一点点糖
And a little bit of sugar.

693
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:39,560
那是我的秘方
And that's my trick.

694
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:40,820
你别说废话了
Why don't you cut the crap?

695
00:59:40,830 --> 00:59:42,860
我有更重要的事要让你去做
I got more important things for you to do.

696
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:43,950
泡利怎么样？
How's Paulie?

697
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,690
哦，泡利，你再也见不到他了
Oh Paulie, won't see him no more.

698
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:48,310
你要去哪里？
Where you going?

699
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:49,810
到城里去
To the city.

700
00:59:50,350 --> 00:59:51,680
派几个保镖跟他一起去
Send some bodyguards with him.

701
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:53,110
- 噢，我只是去医院看爸爸  - 我不管
- I'm just going to see Pop. - Never mind.

702
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:53,940
派人跟他一起去
Send somebody with him.

703
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,620
他不会有事的 索洛佐知道他是"平民"
He'll be all right. Sollozzo knows he's a civilian.

704
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:59,480
- 好吧，小心点  - 是，长官
- All right. Be careful, huh? - Yes, sir.

705
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,130
还是派人跟着他
Send somebody with him anyway.

706
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,210
我得走了
I have to go.

707
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:36,210
我能跟你一起去吗？
Can I go with you?

708
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:39,910
不行，凯伊，那里会有探员
No, Kay. There's gonna be detectives there.

709
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:41,510
媒体的人
People from the press.

710
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:44,460
我搭出租车去
I'll ride in a cab.

711
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:48,540
我不想要你卷进来
I don't want you to get involved.

712
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:54,180
我何时能再见你？
When will I see you again?

713
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:02,520
回新罕布什尔去
Go back to New Hampshire...

714
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:05,390
我打电话去你父母家找你
and I'll call you at your parents' house.

715
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:08,820
我何时才能再见你，迈克尔？
When will I see you again, Michael?

716
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,890
我不知道
I don't know.

717
01:03:23,410 --> 01:03:24,810
你在这里干什么？
What are you doing here?

718
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:27,150
这时候你不该来
You're not supposed to be here now.

719
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:28,540
我是迈克尔・柯利昂尼
I'm Michael Corleone.

720
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:30,180
这是我父亲
This is my father.

721
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:33,470
这里没人，守卫人员都怎么了？
There's nobody here. What happened to the guards?

722
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:38,430
你父亲访客太多，他们妨碍了医院的作业
Your father just had too many visitors. They interfered with hospital service.

723
01:03:38,790 --> 01:03:41,940
警察大概10分钟前要他们离开了
The police made them leave about ten minutes ago.

724
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:51,190
请给我接长滩45620
Get me Long Beach 4-5-6-2-0, please.

725
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:56,150
护士，等一下，待会儿
Nurse, wait a minute. Stay here.

726
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:01,830
- 桑尼，是迈克尔，我在医院  - 哦
- Sonny, Michael. I'm at the hospital. - Yes

727
01:04:01,850 --> 01:04:03,710
听着，我来晚了，这里没有人
Listen. I got here late. There's nobody here.

728
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:04,600
什么？没人？
What? Nobody?

729
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:07,740
没人，泰西欧的人不在，没有探员，没有人
Nobody. No Tessio's men, no detectives, nobody.

730
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:08,900
就爸爸一个人
Pop is all alone.

731
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,540
别惊慌，我们会派人去
Don't panic. We'll send somebody.

732
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:11,630
我不会惊慌
I won't panic.

733
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:15,630
我很抱歉，但你必须离开了
I'm sorry, but you will have to leave.

734
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,240
你和我要把我父亲移到另一个房间
You and I are gonna move my father to another room.

735
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,410
现在你是否卸下这些管子，这样我们能把病床挪出去
Can you disconnect those tubes so we can move the bed out?

736
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:25,730
那绝对不行
That's out of the question.

737
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:27,530
你认识我父亲吗？
Do you know my father?

738
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:29,660
有人正要来杀他
Men are coming here to kill him.

739
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:31,460
你懂吗？
You understand?

740
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:34,390
现在请你帮我忙
Now, help me, please.

741
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:52,110
你是谁？
Who are you?

742
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:55,210
我是恩佐，那个糕饼师
I am Enzo-- the baker.

743
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,570
- 你还记得我吧？  - 恩佐
- You remember me? - Enzo?

744
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:58,500
是的，恩佐
Yes, Enzo.

745
01:05:58,510 --> 01:06:00,520
你最好离开这里，恩佐，这里会有麻烦
You better get out of here, Enzo. There's gonna be trouble.

746
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:04,010
要是有麻烦，我留在这帮你
If there is trouble, I stay here to help you--

747
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:06,510
为了你父亲 为了你父亲
For your father. For your father.

748
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:09,010
好吧，听我说
All right, listen.

749
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:12,300
到外面等我，医院前面，好吗？
Wait for me outside, in front of the hospital. All right?

750
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:14,010
我马上出来，快去
I'll be out in a minute. Go ahead.

751
01:06:14,030 --> 01:06:16,250
好的
Okay.

752
01:06:28,290 --> 01:06:30,440
好好休息吧，爸
Just lie here, Pop.

753
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,960
现在我来照顾你
I'll take care of you now.

754
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:35,250
现在我跟你一起了
I'm with you now.

755
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:38,560
我跟你一起
I'm with you.

756
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:15,990
扔掉这个
Get rid of these.

757
01:07:16,070 --> 01:07:17,310
过来
Come here.

758
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:20,020
把手放在口袋里就像你有把枪
Put your hand in your pocket like you have a gun.

759
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,060
你不会有事的
You'll be all right.

760
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,310
你没事的
You'll be okay.

761
01:08:13,610 --> 01:08:15,420
你做的很好
You did good.

762
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:05,880
我以为把你们这帮意大利打手都关起来了
I thought I got all you guinea hoods locked up.

763
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,170
你在这里搞什么鬼？
What the hell are you doing here?

764
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:10,080
守卫我父亲的人都怎么了，警监？
What happened to the men who were guarding my father, Captain?

765
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:13,690
怎么，你这小混蛋，你算老几敢管我的事？
Why, you little punk. Who the hell are you telling me my business?

766
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:15,820
我把那些人赶走了
I pulled them guys off of here.

767
01:09:15,830 --> 01:09:18,510
你马上走开，离开这医院
Now you get out of here and stay away from this hospital.

768
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:22,120
我不会走，除非你派守卫到我父亲房间去
I'm not moving until you put some guards around my father's room.

769
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:24,210
菲尔，把他带回去
Phil, take him in.

770
01:09:24,430 --> 01:09:25,950
这孩子是清白的，警监
The kid's clean, Captain.

771
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:29,650
- 他是个战斗英雄，从未和…  -  该死的，我说了带他回去
- He's a war hero. He's never been busted-- - Goddamn it, I said take him in.

772
01:09:31,930 --> 01:09:35,010
“土耳其人”付你多少钱陷害我父亲，警监？
What's the Turk paying you to set up my father, Captain?

773
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:37,880
抓牢他，让他站着
Take ahold of him. Stand him up.

774
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:39,280
让他站稳了
Stand him up straight.

775
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,320
我是柯利昂尼家的律师
I'm the attorney for the Corleone family.

776
01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:07,920
这些人是私家侦探，雇来保护维多・柯利昂尼的
These men are private detectives hired to protect Vito Corleone.

777
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:10,350
他们持照携带火器
They're licensed to carry firearms.

778
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:14,540
如果你干涉，明早你得面对一位法官并说明理由
If you interfere, you'll have to appear before a judge in the morning and show cause.

779
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:17,030
好了，让他走
All right, let him go.

780
01:10:18,570 --> 01:10:20,110
来吧
Come on.

781
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,470
这些新面孔是怎么回事？
What's with all the new faces?

782
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,240
现在会需要他们的
Gonna need 'em now.

783
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:56,060
经过医院的事之后，桑尼气疯了
After the hospital thing, Sonny got mad.

784
01:10:56,470 --> 01:10:59,880
我们今早四点干掉了布鲁诺・塔塔利亚
We hit Bruno Tattaglia at 4:00 this morning.

785
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:02,570
老天爷
Jesus Christ.

786
01:11:09,490 --> 01:11:11,770
这里看起来像是座要塞
Looks like a fortress around here.

787
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:15,630
（意大利语）

788
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:19,330
100个雇佣枪手在街头，一天24小时
A hundred button men on the street, 24 hours a day.

789
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:23,050
那土耳其人敢露出一根毛就死定了，相信我
That Turk shows one hair on his ass, he's dead. Believe me.

790
01:11:25,170 --> 01:11:27,840
迈克尔，过来，让我看看你
Hey, Michael, come here. Let me look at you.

791
01:11:31,210 --> 01:11:34,220
你样子好看，挺好看，漂亮极了
You look beautiful. Just beautiful. You're gorgeous.

792
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:35,620
喂，听听这个
Hey, listen to this.

793
01:11:35,630 --> 01:11:37,320
那“土耳其人”，他想谈判
The Turk, he wants to talk.

794
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:39,740
想想那个狗娘养的有多紧张
Imagine the nerve on this son of a bitch.

795
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:42,310
昨晚跟我们赌一把，今天他想面谈
Craps out last night, now he wants a meeting today.

796
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:43,700
- 他怎么说？  - 他怎么说？
- What'd he say? - What did he say?

797
01:11:45,410 --> 01:11:47,690
他要我们派迈克尔去听取提议
He wants us to send Michael to hear the proposition.

798
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:51,300
并保证 那条件好到我们不会拒绝
And the promise is that the deal is so good that we can't refuse.

799
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:52,890
那布鲁诺・塔塔利亚呢？
What about Bruno Tattaglia?

800
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,460
那是条件的一部分
That's part of the deal.

801
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:56,620
布鲁诺抵消了他们对我父亲所做的
Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.

802
01:11:56,630 --> 01:11:58,490
桑尼，我们得听听他们怎么说
Sonny, we ought to hear what they have to say.

803
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:02,110
不不，不要了，这次不要，Consigliere
No more. Not this time, Consigliere.

804
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:05,710
不再和谈，不再讨论，不再上索洛佐的当
No more meetings, no discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.

805
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:07,730
你给他们一个信息：我要索洛佐
You give them one message-- I want Sollozzo.

806
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:08,860
否则就是全面开战，我们去睡床垫
If not, it's all-out war. We go to the mattresses.

807
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:10,130
桑尼，其它家族不会支持的
Sonny, the other families won't sit still for a war.

808
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:12,920
- 那就叫他们把索洛佐交给我  - 桑尼，你父亲不爱听这话
- Then they hand me Sollozzo. - Your father wouldn't hear this.

809
01:12:12,930 --> 01:12:14,460
这是生意，不是个人恩怨
This is business, not personal.

810
01:12:14,470 --> 01:12:15,620
他们枪击我父亲…
They shot my father.

811
01:12:15,630 --> 01:12:19,460
即便枪击你父亲也是生意，不是私事，桑尼
Even shooting your father was business, not personal, Sonny.

812
01:12:19,650 --> 01:12:21,590
那么生意就不得不受损了，行吗？
Well, then business will have to suffer. All right?

813
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,070
听着，帮我个忙，汤姆
And listen, do me a favor, Tom--

814
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:25,400
别再建议如何修修补补
No more advice on how to patch things up.

815
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:27,620
只要帮我赢，好吗？
Just help me win, please. All right?

816
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:36,530
我查了这个麦克劳斯基警监，他打断麦克的下巴
I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw.

817
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:37,830
他怎么样？
What about him?

818
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:41,250
他绝对在索洛佐的工资名单上，而且拿钱很多
He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money.

819
01:12:41,970 --> 01:12:44,220
麦克劳斯基同意当索洛佐的保镖
McCluskey has agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard.

820
01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:46,260
你必须要了解，桑尼
What you have to understand, Sonny...

821
01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:50,030
当索洛佐有了这样的警卫，他就无懈可击了
is that while Sollozzo's being guarded like this,  he is invulnerable.

822
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:53,810
从来没人射杀过纽约警官，从未
Nobody has ever gunned down a New York police captain. Never.

823
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:55,070
那会是个大灾难
It would be disastrous.

824
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,980
五大家族全都会追杀你，桑尼
All the five families would come after you, Sonny.

825
01:12:56,990 --> 01:12:59,840
柯利昂尼家族会被驱逐
The Corleone family would be outcast.

826
01:12:59,850 --> 01:13:03,740
即便是老头的政治保护都会找掩护躲起来
Even the old man's political protection would run for cover.

827
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:06,820
所以我拜托你
So do me a favor.

828
01:13:07,330 --> 01:13:09,740
好好考虑这一点
Take this into consideration.

829
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,640
好吧  我们等
All right, we'll wait.

830
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,520
我们不能等
We can't wait.

831
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:23,430
我们不能等
Can't wait.

832
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:28,030
我不管索洛佐说什么条件，他会杀了爸爸，就这样
I don't care what Sollozzo says about a deal. He's gonna kill Pop. That's it.

833
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:30,130
那是他的关键
That's the key for him.

834
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:31,960
我们必须干掉索洛佐
We've got to get Sollozzo.

835
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:33,760
麦克说得对
Mike is right.

836
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,660
我来问问你
Let me ask you something first.

837
01:13:36,670 --> 01:13:38,600
这个麦克劳斯基呢？
What about this McCluskey?

838
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:41,860
我们拿这个条子怎么办？
What do we do with this cop here?

839
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:48,760
他们想跟我会面，对吧？
They want to have a meeting with me, right?

840
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:55,500
那会是我、麦克劳斯基及索洛佐
It will be me...McCluskey and Sollozzo.

841
01:13:56,470 --> 01:13:58,530
我们来安排会面
Let's set the meeting.

842
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:04,390
找我们的线人打听出在哪里举行
Get our informers to find out where it's going to be held.

843
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:10,140
我们坚持要公共场所，一间酒吧，一家餐厅
We insist it's a public place-- a bar, a restaurant.

844
01:14:10,150 --> 01:14:14,760
某个人多的地方，这样我感觉安全
Someplace where there's people, so I feel safe.

845
01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:19,620
我跟他们一见面，他们就会搜我身，对吧？
They're gonna search me when I first meet them, right?

846
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:22,150
所以我身上不能有武器
So I can't have a weapon on me then.

847
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:28,040
但如果克里门萨能想出一个办法
But if Clemenza can figure a way...

848
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:31,180
替我在那里布置下武器
to have a weapon planted there for me...

849
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:37,560
那我就能杀了他们两个
then I'll kill them both.

850
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,510
你要怎么做？乖乖的大学生
What are you gonna do? Nice college boy, huh?

851
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:54,370
以前不想跟家族事务混在一起
Didn't want to get mixed up in the family business.

852
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:55,860
现在你想干掉一个警监？
Now you want to gun down a police captain?

853
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:58,190
为什么？因为他小小扇了你一耳光？
Why? 'Cause he slapped you in the face a little bit?

854
01:14:58,200 --> 01:14:59,410
你以为这是什么？军队吗？
What're you think? This is the army?

855
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:00,660
在一哩以外开枪打他们？
where you shoot them a mile away?

856
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:02,240
你必须离这么近，然后“砰”
You gotta get up close, like this and--

857
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:04,630
你漂亮的常春藤名校服上溅满他们的脑浆
You blow their brains all over your nice Ivy League suit.

858
01:15:04,850 --> 01:15:05,510
- 过来  - 桑尼
- Come here.  - Sonny.

859
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:08,030
你把这事当成私仇了
You're taking this very personal.

860
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:11,570
汤姆，这是生意，而这位把它当私仇了
Tom, this is business, and this man is taking it very, very personal.

861
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:14,060
不能杀条子是哪里来的说法？
Where does it say you can't kill a cop?

862
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,970
- 好了，麦基  - 汤姆，等一下
- Come on, Mikey. - Tom, wait a minute.

863
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:19,080
我说的这个条子，他跟毒品搅在一起
I'm talking about a cop that's mixed up in drugs.

864
01:15:19,090 --> 01:15:23,040
我说的是个不诚实的条子，不正当的条子
I'm talking about a dishonest cop, a crooked cop...

865
01:15:23,050 --> 01:15:26,210
跟犯罪集团混在一起，终于遭了报应
who got mixed up in the rackets and got what was coming to him.

866
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:28,210
这是个精彩的故事
That's a terrific story.

867
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:31,370
我们的工资单上有报社的人，对吧汤姆？
We have newspaper people on the payroll, don't we, Tom?

868
01:15:32,590 --> 01:15:34,440
他们也许会喜欢这种故事
They might like a story like that.

869
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:37,090
他们也许会，只是也许
They might. They just might.

870
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:44,390
这不是私仇，桑尼，纯粹是公事
It's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly business.

871
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,310
它从没用过
It's as cold as they come.

872
01:15:48,630 --> 01:15:52,120
不可能追踪，所以不用担心指纹，麦克
Impossible to trace, so you don't worry about prints, Mike.

873
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:55,010
我贴了特殊胶布在扳机和柄上
I put a special tape on the trigger and the butt.

874
01:15:55,170 --> 01:15:56,970
来，试试
Here. Try it.

875
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:11,040
怎么？扳机太紧了？
What's the matter, the trigger too tight?

876
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:16,170
- 哇，我的耳朵  - 对，我没处理枪声
- My ears. - Yeah, I left it noisy.

877
01:16:16,230 --> 01:16:20,250
这样就可以吓走多管闲事的旁观者
That way it scares any pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders away.

878
01:16:21,130 --> 01:16:23,610
好了，你杀了他俩，现在你做什么？
All right, you shot them both. Now what do you do?

879
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,360
坐下，吃完我的晚餐
Sit down, finish my dinner.

880
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:30,070
好了，小子，别捣乱啦
Come on, kid. Don't fool around.

881
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:33,670
就让你的手顺身侧垂下，让枪滑走
Just let your hand drop to your side and let the gun slip out.

882
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:35,840
人人都会认为你还拿着它
Everybody will still think you got it.

883
01:16:35,850 --> 01:16:38,010
他们会盯着你的脸，麦克
They're gonna be staring at your face, Mike...

884
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:41,040
所以快步离开那地方，但不要跑
so walk out of the place real fast, but you don't run.

885
01:16:41,230 --> 01:16:44,310
别直视任何人，但你也不要挪开目光
Don't look nobody directly in the eye, but don't look away, either.

886
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:48,570
他们会被你吓坏，相信我，所以什么也不用担心
They're gonna be scared stiff of you, believe me...so don't worry about nothing.

887
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:52,040
你看，你会全身而退的
You know, you're gonna turn out all right.

888
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:54,640
你休个长假，去谁也不知道的地方
You take a long vacation, nobody knows where...

889
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:56,450
而我们来收拾善后
and we're gonna catch the hell.

890
01:16:57,260 --> 01:16:58,960
你觉得情况会有多糟？
How bad do you think it's gonna be?

891
01:16:59,370 --> 01:17:01,050
相当他妈的糟糕
Pretty goddamn bad.

892
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:04,150
可能其它所有家族会联合对付我们
Probably all the other families will line up against us.

893
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:05,170
那也没关系
That's all right.

894
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:08,710
这种事大概每隔5年会发生，或10年
These things gotta happen every five years or so. Ten years.

895
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:10,090
有助于消除不和
Helps to get rid of the bad blood.

896
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:12,430
从上次以来已有10年了
Been ten years since the last one.

897
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,560
你看你得一开始就制止他们
You know you gotta stop them at the beginning...

898
01:17:14,610 --> 01:17:16,780
就像他们本该在慕尼黑制止希特勒
like they should have stopped Hitler at Munich.

899
01:17:16,790 --> 01:17:20,820
他们那次就不该让他逃过去，那是自找麻烦
They should have never let him get away with that. They was just asking for big trouble.

900
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:22,990
知道吗，麦克
You know, Mike,

901
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:26,100
我们都以你为荣…当战斗英雄什么的
we was all proud of you... being a hero and all.

902
01:17:26,410 --> 01:17:28,020
你父亲也是
Your father too.

903
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:09,650
没有，一点线索没有，什么也没有
Nothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing.

904
01:18:10,590 --> 01:18:13,730
连索洛佐的人也不知道在会面哪里举行
Even Sollozzo's people don't know where the meeting will be held.

905
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:16,590
我们有多少时间？
How much time do we have?

906
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:20,550
一个半小时以后，他们在杰克丹普西餐厅前接你上车
pick you up in front of Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half--

907
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:22,310
正好一个半小时以后
exactly an hour and a half.

908
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:26,670
我们可以派盯梢，看看最后去哪儿
We could put a tail on them, see how it turns out.

909
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:29,540
索洛佐会在街上乱转 甩掉我们的人
Sollozzo'll lose our ass going around the block.

910
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,710
谈判中间人呢？
What about the negotiator?

911
01:18:31,990 --> 01:18:34,810
他在我那里和我的手下玩皮纳克纸牌
He's over at my place playing pinochle with a couple of my men.

912
01:18:34,830 --> 01:18:36,560
他很高兴  我们在让他赢
He's happy. They're letting him win.

913
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:38,330
这对麦克太冒险了
It's too much of a risk for Mike.

914
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:39,870
也许我们该取消，桑尼
Maybe we ought to call it off, Sonny.

915
01:18:39,910 --> 01:18:43,520
那个中间人要一直玩牌等到麦克安然无恙回来才走
The negotiator keeps on playing cards until Mike's back safe and sound.

916
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:45,890
那他干嘛不直接对车里不管什么人开火呢？
So why doesn't he just blast who's ever in the goddamn car?

917
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,520
太危险了，他们会注意的
Too dangerous. They'll be looking for that.

918
01:18:47,530 --> 01:18:50,200
索洛佐也许根本就不在车上，桑尼
Sollozzo might not even be in the car, Sonny.

919
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:52,630
我来接
I got it.

920
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,610
布朗克斯的路易斯餐厅
Louis Restaurant in the Bronx.

921
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:21,300
可靠吗？
Well, is it reliable?

922
01:19:21,310 --> 01:19:23,110
麦克劳斯基的分局里有我的人
That's my man in McCluskey's precinct.

923
01:19:23,410 --> 01:19:26,070
警监必须一天24小时待命
A police captain's got to be on call 24 hours a day.

924
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:28,580
他八点到十点会去那里
He signed out at that number between 8:00 and 10:00.

925
01:19:29,210 --> 01:19:30,440
有谁知道那个地方？
Anybody know this joint?

926
01:19:30,450 --> 01:19:32,160
当然，我知道
Yeah, sure. I do.

927
01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:34,130
对我们太理想了
It's perfect for us.

928
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:36,500
小型家庭餐厅，食物不错
A small family place, good food.

929
01:19:36,510 --> 01:19:39,230
大家各吃各的，太理想了
Everyone minds his business. It's perfect.

930
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:42,270
彼得，他们那儿有个旧式马桶
Pete, they got an old-fashioned toilet--

931
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:45,950
你知道就是水箱有吊链的那种
You know, the box and the chain thing.

932
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:50,130
我们或许可把枪用胶带绑在那后面
We might be able to tape the gun behind it.

933
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:51,150
好的
All right.

934
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:54,310
麦克，你去餐厅
Mike, you go to the restaurant.

935
01:19:54,410 --> 01:19:56,660
你吃着谈上一会儿，要放松
You eat, you talk for a while, you relax.

936
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:58,330
你让他们放松下来
You make them relax.

937
01:19:58,510 --> 01:20:00,790
然后你站起来，去解手
Then you get up and go take a leak.

938
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:03,680
不，更好的是，你要求得到许可再去
No, better still, you ask for permission to go.

939
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:05,590
等你回来，你就开枪
And when you come back, you come out blasting.

940
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,510
不要心存侥幸，每人脑袋上来两枪
And don't take any chances. Two shots in the head apiece.

941
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:12,790
好了，听着，我要一个好手，真正的好手去藏枪
Now, listen. I want somebody good-- and I mean very good-- to plant that gun.

942
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,020
我不想我兄弟走出厕所手里只握着自己的老二，明白？
I don't want him coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hands, all right?

943
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:17,310
枪会在那里的
The gun will be there.

944
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:21,420
好，听着，你开车送他，事后再接他回来
All right, listen. You drive him and you pick him up after the job.

945
01:20:21,730 --> 01:20:23,310
来吧，赶紧行动
Come on. Let's move.

946
01:20:29,210 --> 01:20:32,360
他有没有…告诉你完事就扔掉枪？
Did he tell you to drop the gun right away?

947
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:34,260
有，上百万次了
Yeah, a million times.

948
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:38,440
好了
Now

949
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:43,000
你别忘了，每人头上两枪，一出厕所后就打
You don't forget-- two shots apiece in the head as soon as you come out the door.

950
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:44,280
我们走
Let's go.

951
01:20:49,690 --> 01:20:52,330
你认为要多久我才能回家？
How long do you think it'll be before I can come back?

952
01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:56,230
至少得一年，麦克
At least a year, Mike.

953
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:58,080
听着，我会协调妈妈那边…
Listen, I'll square with Mom

954
01:20:58,090 --> 01:21:01,450
你知道你走前不能去看她，还有…
you know you're not seeing her before you leave and...

955
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:04,650
我会给你那女友送个消息
I'll get a message to that girlfriend

956
01:21:04,730 --> 01:21:06,710
等我觉得合适的时候
when I think the time is right.

957
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:14,390
保重
Take care.

958
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:19,310
- 再见，麦克  - 汤姆
- See you, Mike.  - Tom

959
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:53,050
我很高兴你来了，麦克
I'm glad you came, Mike.

960
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,470
我希望我们能摆平所有事情
I hope we can straighten everything out.

961
01:21:56,350 --> 01:21:59,710
我说这太可怕了，这完全不是我想要的发展
I mean this is terrible. It's not the way I wanted things to go at all.

962
01:21:59,870 --> 01:22:01,360
完全就不该发生的
It should have never happened.

963
01:22:01,370 --> 01:22:03,340
我想在今晚摆平所有事
I want to straighten everything out tonight.

964
01:22:03,370 --> 01:22:05,410
我不想要我父亲再受打扰
I don't want my father bothered anymore.

965
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:06,910
他不会了，麦克
He won't be, Mike.

966
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:09,310
我以我的孩子发誓不会
I swear on my children he won't.

967
01:22:10,170 --> 01:22:12,960
但我们谈的时候你得心态开放
But you got to keep an open mind when we talk.

968
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:15,680
我是说，我希望你不像你哥哥那样热血
I mean I hope you're not a hothead like your brother Sonny.

969
01:22:15,690 --> 01:22:17,710
你没办法跟他谈正事
You can't talk business with him.

970
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:19,390
(意大利语)

971
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:21,470
呃，他是个好孩子
He's a good kid.

972
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:27,840
那晚的事我很抱歉，麦克
I'm sorry about the other night, Mike.

973
01:22:29,170 --> 01:22:31,360
我得搜你身，转过来
I gotta frisk you, so turn around, huh?

974
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:34,060
跪在椅子上，面向我
On your knees, facing me.

975
01:22:38,030 --> 01:22:41,070
我想我干这行已经嫌老了
I guess I'm getting too old for my job.

976
01:22:41,860 --> 01:22:43,520
太厌烦
Too grouchy.

977
01:22:44,290 --> 01:22:45,760
受不了别人的激怒
Can't stand the aggravation.

978
01:22:46,930 --> 01:22:48,210
你知道是怎么回事
You know how it is.

979
01:22:50,570 --> 01:22:51,740
他没武器
He's clean.

980
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:19,830
我们要去新泽西？
We're going to New Jersey?

981
01:23:23,310 --> 01:23:24,630
也许
Maybe.

982
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:51,420
干得好，卢
Nice work, Lou.

983
01:24:29,170 --> 01:24:30,910
这餐厅的意大利菜怎么样？
How's the Italian food in this restaurant?

984
01:24:31,340 --> 01:24:32,310
不错
Good.

985
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:34,430
试试小牛肉，是城里最棒的
Try the veal. It's the best in the city.

986
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:35,810
我就点它了
I'll have it.

987
01:24:37,630 --> 01:24:39,650
快[意大利语]

988
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:10,390
好了[意大利语]

989
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:14,110
我要跟麦克说意大利语
I'm gonna speak Italian to Mike.

990
01:25:14,420 --> 01:25:15,440
请便
Go ahead.

991
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:23,820
- 我很抱歉  - 算了

992
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:33,820
要知道，你父亲身上发生的事，是生意

993
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:37,820
我很尊重你的父亲

994
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:41,020
但你父亲的想法过时了

995
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:47,020
你必须理解 我为什么做出那种事

996
01:25:47,310 --> 01:25:51,020
我理解这种事

997
01:25:51,510 --> 01:25:53,970
- 真的理解  - 是吗？

998
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,810
现在我们不得不考虑

999
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,870
你们跟塔塔利亚家族之间的事

1000
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:17,110
我们必须想出办法 何去何从

1001
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:23,210
（这里几句我没法翻译，没英语字幕了）

1002
01:26:23,740 --> 01:26:23,740
（这几句是我猜着翻译的）

1003
01:26:23,740 --> 01:26:25,110
我所关心的是…

1004
01:26:27,530 --> 01:26:28,310
什么？

1005
01:26:30,270 --> 01:26:31,870
怎么说来着？

1006
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:35,870
我想要的…
What I want...

1007
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:39,870
对我来说最重要的…
what's most important to me--

1008
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:44,010
就是我要得到一项保证
is that I have a guarantee:

1009
01:26:44,310 --> 01:26:46,530
不会再有对我父亲生命的威胁
No more attempts on my father's life.

1010
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:49,010
我能给你什么保证，麦克？
What guarantees could I give you, Mike?

1011
01:26:49,740 --> 01:26:50,840
我是被追杀的那个
I am the hunted one.

1012
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:53,130
我错过了我的机会
I missed my chance.

1013
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:54,510
你太看得起我了，孩子
You think too much of me, kid.

1014
01:26:54,990 --> 01:26:56,720
我没有那么聪明
I'm not that clever.

1015
01:26:58,420 --> 01:27:01,310
我想要的只是停战而已
All I want is a truce.

1016
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:09,010
我得去洗手间
I have to go to the bathroom.

1017
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:11,310
可以吗？
Is that all right?

1018
01:27:12,430 --> 01:27:14,110
想去就去吧
You gotta go, you gotta go.

1019
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:22,110
我搜过了，他没武器
I frisked him. He's clean.

1020
01:27:22,580 --> 01:27:23,740
别去太久
Don't take too long.

1021
01:27:27,860 --> 01:27:29,840
我搜过好几千小混混了

我爱你，爷爷

- 对不起，爸，他还不认识你  - 没事
I'm sorry, Pa. He doesn't know you yet. - It's all right.

1033
01:32:48,030 --> 01:32:49,810
来吧，大个子，念给爷爷听
Here you are, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.

闭嘴，去摆桌子

1046

自从麦克劳斯基被杀后
Since McCluskey's killing...

1047
01:33:59,430 --> 01:34:03,730
警方瓦解了我们多数业务
the police have been cracking down on most of our operations.

1048

其它的家族也一样

1049
01:34:07,930 --> 01:34:09,640
有很多冲突
Been a lot of bad blood.

1050

他们打击我们，所以…
They hit us, so...

1051
01:34:12,170 --> 01:34:13,630
我们反击他们
we hit them back.

1052

1055
01:34:26,330 --> 01:34:31,140
爸爸，我…派弗雷多去拉斯维加斯
Dad, I'm sending Fredo to Las Vegas...

1056
01:34:31,150 --> 01:34:33,950
在洛杉矶的唐・弗朗西斯科的保护之下
under the protection of Don Francesco of L.A.

1057
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:35,010
我要他休息一下
I want him to rest.

1058
01:34:35,740 --> 01:34:39,410
- 我要学习赌场生意  - 对
- I'm going to learn the casino business. - Yeah.

1059
01:34:46,630 --> 01:34:47,940
迈克尔在哪里？
Where is Michael?

1060
01:35:00,690 --> 01:35:04,160
是迈克尔杀了索洛佐
It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

1061
01:35:05,630 --> 01:35:07,730
不过他很安全
But he's safe.

1062
01:35:07,740 --> 01:35:09,860
我们会把他弄回来的
We're starting to work to bring him back now.

1063
01:35:31,140 --> 01:35:33,410
我要你查出那个小皮条客塔塔利亚藏在哪里
I want you to find out where that little pimp Tattaglia is hiding.

1064
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:35,430
我要他的命，现在
I want his ass now-- right now.

1065
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:37,130
- 喂，桑尼  - 什么？
- Hey, Sonny. - What?

1066
01:35:37,140 --> 01:35:38,980
事情刚开始缓和下来一点
Things are starting to loosen up a little bit.

1067
01:35:39,010 --> 01:35:41,710
如果你去追塔塔利亚，一切又会失控
If you go after Tattaglia, all hell's going to break loose.

1068
01:35:41,750 --> 01:35:43,570
让硝烟平静，爸爸能去谈判
Let the smoke clear. Pop can negotiate.

1069
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:45,490
不，爸爸在好转之前什么都不能做
No, Pop can't do nothing till he's better.

1070
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:46,430
我要决定什么对我们最有利
I'm gonna decide what's gonna be--

1071
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:48,330
好的，但你开仗耗费了我们一大笔钱
All right, but your war's costing us a lot of money.

1072
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:49,930
没有任何进帐，我们不能做生意
Nothing's coming in. We can't do business.

1073
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:53,020
他们也不行，别担心，拜托你别担心
Neither can they. Don't worry about it.

1074
01:35:53,030 --> 01:35:54,930
- 我们耗不起  - 不会再有消耗战了
- We can't afford a stalemate. - Well there ain't no more stalemate

1075
01:35:54,940 --> 01:35:56,910
我会宰了那老混蛋来做结束，我要…
I'm gonna end it by killing that old bastard. I'm gonna...

1076
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:59,140
对，你名声在外了，我希望你能高兴
Yeah, you're getting a great reputation. I hope you're enjoying it.

1077
01:35:59,150 --> 01:36:00,770
你照我叫你做的去做就好了
You just do what I tell you to do!

1078
01:36:00,780 --> 01:36:03,110
该死的，如果我有个战时Consigliere，一个西西里人
Goddamn it, if I had a wartime consigliere-- a Sicilian--

1079
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:04,760
我就不会是这个样子
I wouldn't be in this shape!

1080
01:36:05,110 --> 01:36:07,360
爸爸有坚科，看看我有什么？
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

1081
01:36:10,810 --> 01:36:13,110
对不起，我不是有意的
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

1082
01:36:14,340 --> 01:36:17,090
妈妈做了点晚餐，今天是星期天
Mom made a little dinner. It's Sunday.

1083
01:36:18,090 --> 01:36:20,060
你看，黑鬼正过着好日子呢…
You know, niggers are having a good time with...

1084
01:36:21,130 --> 01:36:22,970
在我们哈林区的赌场
with our policy banks up there in Harlem.

1085
01:36:22,980 --> 01:36:26,310
开着新凯迪拉克，一注押50%
Driving them new Cadillacs, paying 50% on a bet.

1086
01:36:26,860 --> 01:36:29,610
我早知会这样，只要他们开始挣大钱
I knew that was gonna happen as soon as they started making big money.

1087
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:33,970
爸爸从不在餐桌上当着孩子们谈生意
Papa never talked business at the table in front of the kids.

1088
01:36:33,980 --> 01:36:36,650
- 闭嘴，康妮…  - 不准你叫她闭嘴
-Shut up, Connie. -Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

1089
01:36:36,660 --> 01:36:38,550
- 你听明白了吗？  - 桑提诺
-You got that? -Santino

1090
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:40,360
不要干预
don't interfere.

1091
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:44,380
你看，桑尼、汤姆，我想跟你们谈谈，也许晚饭后？
Look, Sonny, Tom, I'd like to talk to you, maybe after dinner.

1092
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:46,040
我可以为家族做更多…
I could be doing more for the family.

1093
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:48,010
我们不在餐桌上谈公事
We don't discuss business at the table.

1094
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:37,560
吻你的手，唐・汤玛西诺

1095
01:37:41,850 --> 01:37:43,310
麦基

1096
01:37:44,430 --> 01:37:46,870
你怎么离开房子那么远？

1097
01:37:47,060 --> 01:37:49,530
你知道我得对你父亲负责你的性命

1098
01:37:49,550 --> 01:37:51,310
保镖们都在这里

1099
01:37:51,780 --> 01:37:54,300
还是很危险

1100
01:37:54,310 --> 01:37:57,830
我听纽约的桑提诺说的

1101
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:00,640
你的敌人知道你在这里了

1102
01:38:00,810 --> 01:38:04,250
桑提诺有没有说 我何时能回去？

1103
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:05,960
还不行

1104
01:38:05,970 --> 01:38:09,070
这事情根本谈不上

1105
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:10,960
谢谢

1106
01:38:11,730 --> 01:38:13,440
你现在要去哪里?

1107
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:16,140
柯利昂尼村

1108
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:18,440
坐我的车去

1109
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:22,550
我想走路

1110
01:38:24,270 --> 01:38:26,310
小心点

1111
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:48,560
迈克尔，柯利昂尼村到了

1112
01:38:59,990 --> 01:39:01,740
男人全都到哪儿去了？

1113
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,540
他们全都死于血仇

1114
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:09,460
看，这里是死者的姓名

1115
01:39:56,840 --> 01:39:59,110
妈妈咪呀，好一个美女

1116
01:40:08,070 --> 01:40:10,610
我看你是被那道霹雳击中了

1117
01:40:15,490 --> 01:40:16,880
迈克尔

1118
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:21,310
在西西里，女人比lupara[猎枪]还危险

1119
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:46,010
打猎有收获吗？

1120
01:40:46,110 --> 01:40:51,440
你认识这一带所有的女孩吗?

1121
01:40:51,510 --> 01:40:55,600
我们看到几个真正的美人

1122
01:40:58,450 --> 01:41:01,910
其中一个让我们的朋友被霹雳击中了

1123
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:03,710
她会诱出他心中的恶魔

1124
01:41:08,810 --> 01:41:10,520
对啊，真的是应有尽有

1125
01:41:10,540 --> 01:41:11,440
是吧，卡洛？

1126
01:41:11,450 --> 01:41:12,640
应有尽有

1127
01:41:15,740 --> 01:41:18,040
那样的头发、嘴巴

1128
01:41:18,090 --> 01:41:18,940
嘴巴

1129
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:23,450
这一带的女孩很漂亮，但是贞洁正派

1130
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:26,310
这个穿着紫色衣服

1131
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:27,810
头发上绑着紫色的缎带

1132
01:41:28,060 --> 01:41:29,210
头发上绑着紫色的缎带

1133
01:41:29,270 --> 01:41:33,310
看起来像希腊人而不是意大利人

1134
01:41:33,610 --> 01:41:34,910
像希腊人，不像意大利人

1135
01:41:35,170 --> 01:41:38,200
- 你认识她吗？  - 你认识她吗？

1136
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:40,440
不

1137
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:45,340
这个镇子里没有那样的女孩

1138
01:41:46,630 --> 01:41:49,220
我的天  我明白了

1139
01:41:52,460 --> 01:41:53,630
有什么不对了？

1140
01:41:56,040 --> 01:41:57,440
我们走

1141
01:41:58,930 --> 01:42:00,140
是他女儿

1142
01:42:00,420 --> 01:42:01,310
叫他出来

1143
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:05,710
不不不，叫他出来

1144
01:42:26,690 --> 01:42:29,430
法布里吉奥，你翻译

1145
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:30,740
是的，先生

1146
01:42:33,010 --> 01:42:35,430
如果我冒犯了你，我道歉
I apologize if I offended you.

1147
01:42:36,110 --> 01:42:38,030
我在这个国家是个外来人
I'm a stranger in this country...

1148
01:42:39,460 --> 01:42:42,310
我无意冒犯你和你女儿
and I meant no disrespect to you or your daughter.

1149
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:50,440
我是个美国人，躲在西西里
I'm an American hiding in Sicily.

1150
01:42:52,410 --> 01:42:53,830
我的名字是迈克尔・柯利昂尼
My name is Michael Corleone.

1151
01:42:56,620 --> 01:42:59,310
有人愿意出高价获知这个消息
There are people who would pay a lot of money for that information.

1152
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:05,240
但那样你女儿会失去父亲
But then your daughter would lose a father...

1153
01:43:07,540 --> 01:43:09,430
而不是得到一位丈夫
instead of gaining a husband.

1154
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:19,510
我想跟你女儿见面
I want to meet your daughter...

1155
01:43:20,930 --> 01:43:22,330
在你的准许之下
with your permission...

1156
01:43:23,020 --> 01:43:25,310
以及你家人的监督之下
and under the supervision of your family...

1157
01:43:26,410 --> 01:43:28,940
满怀诚意
with all respect.

1158
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:36,590
星期天早上到我家来

1159
01:43:37,140 --> 01:43:38,590
我叫维泰利

1160
01:43:42,690 --> 01:43:44,010
谢谢

1161
01:43:44,540 --> 01:43:46,110
她叫什么名字？

1162
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:48,060
阿波罗妮娅

1163
01:43:49,330 --> 01:43:50,140
很美

1164
01:44:42,740 --> 01:44:45,410
这是我女儿，阿波罗妮娅

1165
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:49,450
这位是迈克尔・柯利昂尼先生

1166
01:45:05,830 --> 01:45:07,310
谢谢

1167
01:45:08,110 --> 01:45:09,010
不客气

1168
01:45:19,110 --> 01:45:21,910
你的眼睛怎么了？

1169
01:45:22,010 --> 01:45:24,010
不不，没什么，没事

1170
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:42,630
嘿，我要搞到你晕
Hey, I'll knock you dizzy.

1171
01:46:48,410 --> 01:46:49,610
废话少说
Save it for the library.

1172
01:46:54,030 --> 01:46:56,630
来吧，我们得去接我妹妹，咱们走
Come on, we gotta pick up my sister. Lets' go.

1173
01:47:14,790 --> 01:47:15,920
怎么了？
What's the matter?

1174
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:20,120
怎么了？
What's the matter?

1175
01:47:22,550 --> 01:47:23,650
是我的错
It was my fault!

1176
01:47:23,660 --> 01:47:25,020
- 他在哪？  - 桑尼，求你了
- Where is he?  - Sonny, please.

1177
01:47:25,030 --> 01:47:27,770
是我的错，桑尼，是我的错，我打了他
It was my fault. Sonny, it was my fault. I hit him.

1178
01:47:27,780 --> 01:47:29,860
我先开始打他的，求你了，桑尼
I started a fight with him. Please, Sonny.

1179
01:47:29,870 --> 01:47:31,910
我打了他，他才打的我，我…
I hit him, so he hit me. I...

1180
01:47:31,930 --> 01:47:33,630
好了
Okay.

1181
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:40,230
好了，我只是叫医生来看你，好吗？
Okay, I'm just gonna get a doctor to come and take a look at you.

1182
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:43,110
桑尼，求你什么也别做，求你什么也别做
Sonny, please don't do anything. Please don't do anything.

1183
01:47:44,540 --> 01:47:46,420
你是怎么了？我会做什么？
What's the matter with you? What am I gonna do?

1184
01:47:46,830 --> 01:47:49,620
我会让这孩子没出生就当孤儿吗？
Am I gonna make that baby an orphan before he's born?

1185
01:47:53,130 --> 01:47:53,920
好了吗？
All right?

1186
01:47:54,330 --> 01:47:57,110
你们这帮西班牙傻蛋还在重注押洋基队吗？
You spic slobs still betting the Yankees pretty heavy?

1187
01:47:57,660 --> 01:47:59,620
叫他不要再接受投注了好吗？
Tell him to stop taking action, all right?

1188
01:48:01,060 --> 01:48:03,110
你上周末输给我的钱够多了
You lost enough money last weekend to me.

1189
01:48:09,260 --> 01:48:11,580
卡洛，过来，过来！
Carlo, come here.

1190
01:48:14,860 --> 01:48:15,580
来啊
Come on.

1191
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:11,460
你再碰我妹妹一下我就杀了你
You touch my sister again, I'll kill you.

1192
01:49:27,730 --> 01:49:33,470
(意大利语)

1193
01:53:06,850 --> 01:53:08,060
没想到你会来，凯伊
Weren't expecting you, Kay.

1194
01:53:08,780 --> 01:53:09,630
你应该先打个电话来
You should call.

1195
01:53:09,740 --> 01:53:11,290
没错，我打过
Yes, well, I have.

1196
01:53:11,380 --> 01:53:14,010
我是说，我试过写信和打电话
I mean I've tried writing and calling.

1197
01:53:14,260 --> 01:53:16,550
现在，我要和迈克尔联络

1198
01:53:16,740 --> 01:53:18,110
没人知道他在哪

1199
01:53:18,210 --> 01:53:20,440
我们知道他没事，但仅此而已了
We know he's all right, but that's all.

1200
01:53:23,310 --> 01:53:24,270
那是怎么回事？

那是一场事故，但没有人受伤
That's an accident. But nobody was hurt.

1202

Would you give this letter to Michael, please? Please?

1204

如果我接受了
if I accepted that

1205
01:53:35,630 --> 01:53:38,970
在法庭上，它就可以证实我知道他在哪里
in a court of law they could prove I have knowledge of his whereabouts.

1206
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:41,750

Why don't you bring your whore home for dinner?

1220
01:55:07,010 --> 01:55:09,150
也许我会的，有何不可？

02:07:44,580 --> 02:07:46,650
塔塔利亚失去了一个儿子
Tattaglia lost a son...

1336
02:07:46,790 --> 02:07:48,070
我也失去了一个儿子
and I lost a son.

1337
02:07:50,340 --> 02:07:51,770
我们两抵了
We're quits

1338
02:07:51,780 --> 02:07:53,740
如果塔塔利亚同意
and if Tattaglia agrees...

1339
02:07:53,910 --> 02:07:58,430
我愿意 让事情回到过去的路子上
then I'm willing to let things go on the way they were before.

1340
02:07:59,440 --> 02:08:02,880
我们都感谢唐・柯利昂尼 召开这次会议
We are all grateful to Don Corleone for calling this meeting.

1341
02:08:03,040 --> 02:08:05,430
我们都了解他是个说话算数的人
We all know him as a man of his word.

1342
02:08:05,810 --> 02:08:08,470
一个谦虚的人，总是能听进去道理
A modest man. He'll always listen to reason.

1343
02:08:08,480 --> 02:08:10,340
是的，唐・巴茨尼
Yes, Don Barzini.

1344
02:08:10,670 --> 02:08:12,780
他太谦虚了
He's too modest.

1345
02:08:12,790 --> 02:08:16,810
他有那么多法官和政客在自己口袋里
He had all the judges and politicians in his pocket.

1346
02:08:16,980 --> 02:08:19,410
他却拒绝分享他们
He refused to share them.

1347
02:08:20,040 --> 02:08:23,770
何时？我何时拒绝过通融？
When？ When did I ever refuse an accommodation?

1348
02:08:23,830 --> 02:08:25,740
你们在座的全都认识我
All of you know me here.

1349
02:08:27,140 --> 02:08:31,010
我何时曾经拒绝过？除了一次
When did I ever refuse, except one time?

1350
02:08:31,430 --> 02:08:32,390
那为什么呢？
And why?

1351
02:08:34,030 --> 02:08:39,470
因为我相信毒品生意 在往后几年会毁了我们
Because I believe this drug business...is gonna destroy us in the years to come.

1352
02:08:39,850 --> 02:08:44,180
我是说，它不像赌博、酒类或甚至女人
I mean, it's not like gambling or liquor or even women...

1353
02:08:44,210 --> 02:08:46,600
那是如今多数人想要的东西
which is something that most people want nowadays

1354
02:08:46,610 --> 02:08:50,330
被教会的大人物[意大利语]所禁止
and is forbidden to them by the pezzonovante of the church.

1355
02:08:50,340 --> 02:08:55,080
即使警察过去在赌博和其它方面一直帮我们
Even the police departments that have helped us in the past with gambling and other things

1356
02:08:55,090 --> 02:08:58,710
但一提到毒品 他们会拒绝帮忙
are gonna refuse to help us when it comes to narcotics.

1357
02:08:59,430 --> 02:09:04,340
那时候我相信是这样，现在我也相信
And I believed that then... and I believe that now.

1358
02:09:04,590 --> 02:09:06,620
时代已经变了
Times have changed.

1359
02:09:06,850 --> 02:09:09,010
不像往日那样了
It's not like the old days...

1360
02:09:09,170 --> 02:09:11,410
那时我们能为所欲为
when we could do anything we want.

1361
02:09:11,740 --> 02:09:14,420
拒绝不是为友之道
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

1362
02:09:14,610 --> 02:09:18,730
如果唐・柯利昂尼掌握纽约全体法官和政客
If Don Corleone had all the judges and politicians in New York...

1363
02:09:18,740 --> 02:09:21,760
那他就必须分享，或让我们都能利用他们
then he must share them or let others use them.

1364
02:09:21,810 --> 02:09:25,110
他必须让我们从这口井里打水
He must let us draw the water from the well.

1365
02:09:25,850 --> 02:09:29,210
当然，他可以为这样的服务开出账单
Certainly, he can present a bill for such services.

1366
02:09:29,540 --> 02:09:32,710
毕竟，我们不是共产党
After all, we are not Communists.

1367
02:09:35,370 --> 02:09:37,870
我同样不相信毒品
I also don't believe in drugs.

1368
02:09:38,510 --> 02:09:40,810
多年来我额外付费给我的人
For years, I paid my people extra...

1369
02:09:40,830 --> 02:09:43,060
让他们不去做那种生意
so they wouldn't do that kind of business.

1370
02:09:43,480 --> 02:09:46,550
有人来找他们，并且说：“我有白粉
Somebody comes to them and says, "I have powders.

1371
02:09:46,560 --> 02:09:50,090
“只要你投入3、4千资金
If you put up a three, four-thousand-dollar investment...

1372
02:09:50,360 --> 02:09:53,520
“我们可以赚到5万来分”
we can make 50,000 distributing."

1373
02:09:54,110 --> 02:09:55,530
所以他们不能抵抗
So they can't resist.

1374
02:09:55,560 --> 02:10:00,260
我想要把它作为一门生意控制好，保持正派
I want to control it as a business...to keep it respectable.

1375
02:10:00,470 --> 02:10:02,340
我不要它接近学校
I don't want it near schools.

1376
02:10:02,350 --> 02:10:04,670
我不要把它卖给孩子
I don't want it sold to children.

1377
02:10:05,180 --> 02:10:07,500
那是丧良心的[意大利语]
That's an infamia.

1378
02:10:08,340 --> 02:10:12,240
在我的城市，我们会把买卖保持在黑人，有色人种当中
In my city, we'll keep the traffic in the dark people, the colored.

1379
02:10:12,250 --> 02:10:16,060
他们反正是动物，所以让他们灵魂堕落吧
They're animals anyway, so let them lose their souls.

1380
02:10:22,110 --> 02:10:26,170
我早希望我们能到这里来，一起讲讲道理
I hoped that we could come here and reason together.

1381
02:10:27,110 --> 02:10:30,940
身为一个讲道理的人，我愿意做任何事…
As a reasonable man, I'm willing to do whatever's necessary to...

1382
02:10:31,290 --> 02:10:34,180
为这些问题找到一个和平的解决方案
find a peaceful solution to these problems.

1383
02:10:34,230 --> 02:10:35,610
那我们就都同意了
Then we are agreed.

1384
02:10:36,020 --> 02:10:38,790
毒品买卖将会获准，但要有控制
The traffic in drugs will be permitted but controlled.

1385
02:10:38,810 --> 02:10:41,880
唐・柯利昂尼会给我们东部的保护
Don Corleone will give us protection in the east...

1386
02:10:41,890 --> 02:10:43,540
这样就有和平
and there will be the peace.

1387
02:10:43,550 --> 02:10:46,410
但我必须有唐・柯利昂尼的直接担保
But I must have strict assurance from Corleone.

1388
02:10:47,140 --> 02:10:50,510
随着时间推移，他的地位变得更强大…
As time goes by and his position becomes stronger...

1389
02:10:50,530 --> 02:10:53,070
他会不会意图报血仇？
will he attempt any individual vendetta?

1390
02:10:53,080 --> 02:10:55,160
你看，我们这全是讲理的人
Look, we are all reasonable men here.

1391
02:10:55,170 --> 02:10:58,310
我们不必给出保证，好像我们是律师
We don't have to give assurances as if we were lawyers.

1392
02:10:58,660 --> 02:11:00,220
你说到复仇
You talk about vengeance.

1393
02:11:01,440 --> 02:11:04,130
复仇会把你儿子带回给你吗？
Is vengeance gonna bring your son back to you?

1394
02:11:04,720 --> 02:11:07,060
或把我的儿子给我？
Or my boy to me?

1395
02:11:07,260 --> 02:11:10,520
我放弃为我儿子复仇
I forego the vengeance of my son.

1396
02:11:13,020 --> 02:11:15,630
但我有自私的理由
But I have selfish reasons.

1397
02:11:17,620 --> 02:11:21,980
我最小的儿子，被迫离开这个国家
My youngest son...was forced to leave this country...

1398
02:11:23,130 --> 02:11:25,090
因为索洛佐这件事
because of this Sollozzo business.

1399
02:11:26,070 --> 02:11:30,890
好吧，我必须做出各种安排，把他安全带回来
All right. And I have to make arrangements to bring him back here safely.

1400
02:11:31,110 --> 02:11:34,140
澄清所有这些错误的指控
cleared of all these false charges.

1401
02:11:35,290 --> 02:11:37,740
但我是个迷信的人
But I'm a superstitious man.

1402
02:11:38,440 --> 02:11:40,850
如果有什么不幸意外落在他身上
And if some unlucky accident should befall him--

1403
02:11:40,860 --> 02:11:44,690
如果他被一个警官开枪打中脑袋
if he should get shot in the head by a police officer...

1404
02:11:45,130 --> 02:11:48,820
或如果他在自己的牢房里上吊
or if he should hang himself in his jail cell...

1405
02:11:48,860 --> 02:11:52,280
或如果他被一道闪电击中
of if he's struck by a bolt of lightening--

1406
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:56,410
那我将怪罪这房间里的某些人
then I'm going to blame some of the people in this room.

1407
02:11:58,270 --> 02:12:00,710
那是我不会原谅的
And that I do not forgive.

1408
02:12:03,090 --> 02:12:06,050
但是，除此之外…
But that aside...

1409
02:12:08,520 --> 02:12:15,250
我可以说我发誓，以我孙子的灵魂
let me say that I swear... on the souls of my grandchildren...

1410
02:12:15,730 --> 02:12:20,100
我不会是打破我们今天和议的人
that I will not be the one to break the peace we've made here today.

1411
02:12:45,530 --> 02:12:47,410
我跟见塔塔利亚的人会面时…
When I meet with the Tattaglia people...

1412
02:12:47,420 --> 02:12:50,710
要不要坚持那些毒品中间人 都没有前科？
should I insist that all these drug middlemen have clean records?

1413
02:12:51,120 --> 02:12:53,620
提出来即可，不要坚持
Mention it. Don't insist.

1414
02:12:55,360 --> 02:12:58,480
巴茨尼是个不用说也明白的人
Barzini is a man who'll know that without being told.

1415
02:12:59,170 --> 02:13:00,530
你是说塔塔利亚
You mean Tattaglia.

1416
02:13:02,070 --> 02:13:03,380
塔塔利亚是个拉皮条的
Tattaglia's a pimp.

1417
02:13:04,740 --> 02:13:08,060
他根本不可能干掉桑提诺
He never could've outfought Santino.

1418
02:13:10,550 --> 02:13:13,640
但我直到今天以前并不知道，这事……
But I didn't know until this day that it was...

1419
02:13:14,480 --> 02:13:16,550
一直是巴茨尼做的
Barzini all along.

1420
02:13:31,510 --> 02:13:32,960
来吧，南希
Come on, Nancy.

1421
02:13:34,760 --> 02:13:37,940
大家待在一起  布莱恩
Keep together, everyone. Brian?

1422
02:13:38,740 --> 02:13:40,770
好了，对了
Okay. All right.

1423
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:55,360
你回来多久了？
How long have you been back?

1424
02:13:56,510 --> 02:13:57,810
我回来一年了
I've been back a year.

1425
02:13:59,700 --> 02:14:01,680
我觉得还要长
Longer than that, I think.

1426
02:14:04,520 --> 02:14:06,720
见到你真好，凯伊
It's good to see you, Kay.

1427
02:14:17,740 --> 02:14:20,220
我现在为我父亲做事，凯伊
I'm working for my father now, Kay.

1428
02:14:22,820 --> 02:14:26,120
他一直病着，病得很重
He's been sick.Very sick.

1429
02:14:27,390 --> 02:14:29,310
可你并不像他，迈克尔
But you're not like him, Michael.

1430
02:14:29,410 --> 02:14:32,170
我以为你不会变成你父亲那样的人
I thought you weren't going to become a man like your father.

1431
02:14:32,180 --> 02:14:33,720
那是你告诉我的
That's what you told me.

1432
02:14:35,070 --> 02:14:38,110
我父亲跟其他有权的人没有区别
My father's no different than any other powerful man.

1433
02:14:39,530 --> 02:14:43,870
那种对其他人负有责任的人
Any man who's responsible for other people.

1434
02:14:44,140 --> 02:14:46,310
像是参议员或总统
Like a senator or a president.

1435
02:14:46,730 --> 02:14:48,570
你知道你说得多天真吗？
Do you know how naive you sound?

1436
02:14:48,580 --> 02:14:49,260
为什么？
Why?

1437
02:14:49,270 --> 02:14:52,410
参议员和总统不会派人杀人
Senators and presidents don't have men killed.

1438
02:14:55,120 --> 02:14:57,110
是谁天真，凯伊？
Who's being naive, Kay?

1439
02:14:58,430 --> 02:15:01,450
凯伊，我父亲做事的方法已经过时，结束了
Kay, my father's way of doing things is over. It's finished.

1440
02:15:01,810 --> 02:15:03,650
他也知道这一点
Even he knows that.

1441
02:15:04,160 --> 02:15:08,810
我是说 在五年柯利昂尼家族会完全合法化
I mean, in five years the Corleone family is going to be completely legitimate.

1442
02:15:10,370 --> 02:15:13,310
相信我，有关我的公事，我只能告诉你这些
Trust me. That's all I can tell you about my business.

1443
02:15:13,520 --> 02:15:14,510
凯伊
Kay

1444
02:15:15,810 --> 02:15:17,590
迈克尔，你为什么要来这里？
Michael, why did you come here?

1445
02:15:18,070 --> 02:15:19,540
为什么？
Why?

1446
02:15:20,460 --> 02:15:25,180
你想要我怎样？这么长时间连电话也没有，也没有信
What do you want with me after all this time without even calling or writing?

1447
02:15:25,310 --> 02:15:27,120
我来是因为我需要你
I came here because I need you.

1448
02:15:27,310 --> 02:15:28,720
因为我关心你
Because I care for you.

1449
02:15:28,730 --> 02:15:30,940
- 请别说了，迈克尔  - 因为…
- Please stop it, Michael. -Because...

1450
02:15:31,450 --> 02:15:32,920
我想要你嫁给我
I want you to marry me.

1451
02:15:34,410 --> 02:15:37,440
- 太迟了，太迟了…  - 求你，凯伊
- It's too late. - Please, Kay.

1452
02:15:38,620 --> 02:15:41,360
你要我做什么我都愿意，任何事，来弥补…
I'll do anything you ask, anything to make up

1453
02:15:41,420 --> 02:15:43,390
我俩过去发生的事
for what's happened to us.

1454
02:15:44,580 --> 02:15:46,810
因为那很重要，凯伊
Because that's important, Kay.

1455
02:15:46,820 --> 02:15:49,590
因为重要的是…
Because what's important is that...

1456
02:15:50,270 --> 02:15:51,510
我们拥有彼此
we have each other.

1457
02:15:52,070 --> 02:15:54,370
是我们要共度一生
That we have a life together.

1458
02:15:55,170 --> 02:15:56,720
是我们要有孩子
That we have children--

1459
02:15:56,740 --> 02:15:57,850
我们的孩子
our children.

1460
02:15:59,370 --> 02:16:00,310
凯伊
Kay.

1461
02:16:00,720 --> 02:16:01,910
我需要你
I need you...

1462
02:16:03,380 --> 02:16:05,620
而且我爱你
and I love you.

1463
02:16:27,260 --> 02:16:29,360
巴茨尼的人楔进我的地盘
Barzini's people chisel my territory...

1464
02:16:29,370 --> 02:16:31,110
而我们却什么也没做
and we do nothing about it.

1465
02:16:31,120 --> 02:16:33,920
很快我在布鲁克林就连挂帽子的地方都没有了
Pretty soon, there won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.

1466
02:16:33,930 --> 02:16:34,850
耐心点
Just be patient.

1467
02:16:34,860 --> 02:16:38,020
我不是求你帮忙，麦克，只是不想受掣肘
I'm not askin' you for help, Mike. I just take off the handcuffs.

1468
02:16:38,040 --> 02:16:39,310
耐心点
Be patient.

1469
02:16:39,320 --> 02:16:41,220
我们必须保护自己
We gotta protect ourselves.

1470
02:16:41,230 --> 02:16:43,220
给我个机会招募一些新人
Give me a chance to recruit some new men.

1471
02:16:43,230 --> 02:16:44,330
不
No.

1472
02:16:44,920 --> 02:16:47,530
我不想给巴茨尼借口来开战
I don't wanna give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.

1473
02:16:47,540 --> 02:16:48,850
麦克，你错了
Mike, you're wrong.

1474
02:16:50,210 --> 02:16:51,310
唐・柯利昂尼
Don Corleone,

1475
02:16:52,470 --> 02:16:56,580
你曾说过 要让我跟泰西欧有一天能自立门户
you once said the day would come when Tessio and me could form our own family.

1476
02:16:56,590 --> 02:16:58,580
今天以前 我绝对没想过
Till today, I would never think of it.

1477
02:16:58,590 --> 02:17:00,690
我要求你的批准
I must ask your permission.

1478
02:17:01,540 --> 02:17:04,420
现在迈克尔是家族首领
Well, Michael is now head of the family and

1479
02:17:04,430 --> 02:17:07,820
如果他准许了，我就祝福你
if he gives his permission, then you have my blessing.

1480
02:17:08,870 --> 02:17:11,120
等我们搬到内华达州后
After we make the move to Nevada...

1481
02:17:11,170 --> 02:17:13,880
你就可以从柯利昂尼家族分出去，自立门户
you can break off from the Corleone family and go on your own.

1482
02:17:14,350 --> 02:17:15,660
等我们搬到内华达州之后
After we make the move to Nevada.

1483
02:17:15,670 --> 02:17:17,160
那会有多久？
How long will that be?

1484
02:17:18,780 --> 02:17:20,330
6个月
Six months.

1485
02:17:20,340 --> 02:17:23,230
原谅我，教父，但你这一走…
Forgive me, Godfather, but with you gone...

1486
02:17:23,540 --> 02:17:26,620
我跟彼得迟早会被巴茨尼捏在手中
me and Pete'll come under Barzini's thumb sooner or later.

1487
02:17:26,630 --> 02:17:28,480
我恨那该死的巴茨尼
And I hate that goddamn Barzini.

1488
02:17:28,490 --> 02:17:31,860
6个月的时间，剩不下什么给我们建设了
In six months' time, there won't be nothing left to build on.

1489
02:17:32,130 --> 02:17:34,480
你们对我的判断有信心吗？
You have faith in my judgment?

1490
02:17:34,630 --> 02:17:36,520
- 是的  - 你们对我忠心吗？
- Yes.  - Do I have your loyalty?

1491
02:17:36,640 --> 02:17:38,240
是的，一向如此，教父
Yes, always, Godfather.

1492
02:17:38,250 --> 02:17:40,120
那就当迈克尔的朋友吧
Then be a friend to Michael...

1493
02:17:40,380 --> 02:17:42,410
照他说的做
and do as he says.

1494
02:17:46,320 --> 02:17:48,060
现在有些事仍在磋商…
There are things being negotiated now...

1495
02:17:48,070 --> 02:17:51,620
将会解决你们的所有问题，解答所有疑问
that are gonna solve all your problems and answer all your questions.

1496
02:17:51,790 --> 02:17:53,760
现在我只能告诉你们这些
That's all I can tell you now.

1497
02:17:55,010 --> 02:17:57,130
卡洛，你在内华达长大
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

1498
02:17:57,540 --> 02:18:00,640
等我们搬过去的时候，你会是我的左右手
When we make our move there, you're gonna be my right-hand man.

1499
02:18:01,010 --> 02:18:03,310
汤姆・黑根不再做Consigliere了
Tom Hagen's no longer consigliere.

1500
02:18:03,570 --> 02:18:05,660
他将会是我们在维加斯的律师
He's gonna be our lawyer in Vegas.

1501
02:18:06,010 --> 02:18:08,520
对汤姆没有不满，但我想要这样
That's no reflection on Tom, but that's the way I want it.

1502
02:18:08,580 --> 02:18:12,740
再说，要是我需要什么建议，有比我父亲更好的Consigliere吗？Consigliere
Besides, if I ever need help who's a better consigliere than my father?

1503
02:18:12,770 --> 02:18:13,830
就这些
That's it.

1504
02:18:27,110 --> 02:18:27,920
好的
All right.

1505
02:18:33,360 --> 02:18:36,020
- 谢谢，爸爸  - 我为你高兴，卡洛
- Thank you, Papa. - I'm happy for you, Carlo.

1506
02:18:37,470 --> 02:18:40,790
迈克尔…我为何出局了？
Michael...Why am I out?

1507
02:18:41,640 --> 02:18:44,660
你不适合当战时Consigliere
You're not a wartime consigliere.

1508
02:18:45,720 --> 02:18:48,940
随着我们这次转移，情况会变得棘手
Things may get rough with the move we're trying.

1509
02:18:49,050 --> 02:18:50,430
汤姆
Tom.

1510
02:18:55,430 --> 02:18:57,440
我跟迈克尔建议的
I advised Michael.

1511
02:18:57,590 --> 02:19:00,630
我从不认为你是个糟糕的Consigliere
I never thought you were a bad consigliere.

1512
02:19:00,740 --> 02:19:04,010
我认为…桑提诺是个糟糕的唐
I thought Santino was a bad Don...

1513
02:19:04,020 --> 02:19:06,020
愿他安息
rest in peace.

1514
02:19:06,280 --> 02:19:10,090
我对迈克尔完全信任，对你也是
Michael has all my confidence, as you do.

1515
02:19:10,530 --> 02:19:11,700
但是…
But...

1516
02:19:11,910 --> 02:19:16,210
要你不参与即将发生的事情 是有理由的
there are reasons why you must have no part of what is going to happen.

1517
02:19:16,520 --> 02:19:18,050
也许我能帮上忙
Maybe I could help.

1518
02:19:18,210 --> 02:19:20,020
你出局了，汤姆
You're out, Tom.

1519
02:20:08,930 --> 02:20:11,550
我无法不注意你脸的模样
I can't get over the way your face looks.

1520
02:20:11,570 --> 02:20:13,220
它看起来真的很棒
It really looks good.

1521
02:20:13,240 --> 02:20:14,880
这医生干得不错
This doctor did some job.

1522
02:20:14,920 --> 02:20:16,210
谁说服你去的，凯伊吗？
Who talked you into it, Kay?

1523
02:20:16,220 --> 02:20:18,640
喂喂喂，把它们留在这里
Hey, hey, wait. Leave them out here.

1524
02:20:18,650 --> 02:20:20,020
我们待会儿再处理它们
We'll deal with them later.

1525
02:20:20,030 --> 02:20:21,440
他累了，他要梳洗一下
He's tired. He wants to clean up.

1526
02:20:21,450 --> 02:20:23,650
好了，现在我来开门好吗？
All right, now, let me open the door, all right?

1527
02:20:30,640 --> 02:20:32,820

1536
02:20:51,890 --> 02:20:53,810
这得要你来搞清楚了
That's for you to find out.

1537
02:20:53,830 --> 02:20:55,620
把她们弄走，弗雷多

02:23:37,360 --> 02:23:39,230
你的赌场赔钱了
Your casino loses money.

1596
02:23:39,240 --> 02:23:40,820
也许我们能做得更好些
Maybe we can do better.

1597
02:23:40,830 --> 02:23:42,820
你以为我滑下顶峰了，迈克尔？
You think I'm skimming off the top, Mike?

1598
02:23:44,110 --> 02:23:45,360
你运气不好
You're unlucky.

1599
02:23:49,670 --> 02:23:52,220
你这该死的意大利佬真把我逗乐了
You goddamn guineas really make me laugh.

1600
02:23:52,230 --> 02:23:55,210
你们有难时 我帮你们忙收留弗雷迪
I do you a favor and take Freddy in when you're having a bad time.

1601
02:23:55,220 --> 02:23:56,430
现在你想把我挤走
Then you try to push me out!

1602
02:23:56,450 --> 02:23:57,620
等一下
Wait a minute.

1603
02:23:58,030 --> 02:24:01,420
你收留弗雷迪，是因为柯利昂尼家族给你的赌场财政支援
You took Freddy in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino...

1604
02:24:01,430 --> 02:24:03,630
因为海岸的莫伦纳里家族
because the Molinari family on the coast...

1605
02:24:03,640 --> 02:24:05,030
保证他的安全
guaranteed his safety.

1606
02:24:05,040 --> 02:24:07,030
现在我们谈的是生意，我们来谈谈生意
Now, we're talkin' business. Let's talk business.

1607
02:24:07,040 --> 02:24:08,210
好，我们来谈生意，麦克
Let's talk business, Mike.

1608
02:24:08,540 --> 02:24:09,930
首先，你们都完了
First of all, you're all done.

1609
02:24:09,940 --> 02:24:12,310
柯利昂尼家族再也没有那么强大了
The Corleone family don't even have that kind of muscle anymore.

1610
02:24:12,320 --> 02:24:13,740
教父生病了，对吧？
The Godfather's sick, right?

1611
02:24:13,790 --> 02:24:16,660
你们被巴茨尼及其它家族 赶出了纽约
You're getting chased out of New York...by Barzini and the other families.

1612
02:24:16,820 --> 02:24:17,990
你以为是怎么回事？
What do you think is gonna on?

1613
02:24:18,010 --> 02:24:20,440
你以为能到我的酒店来接管？
You think you can come to my hotel and take over?

1614
02:24:20,940 --> 02:24:22,550
我和巴茨尼谈过
I talked to Barzini.

1615
02:24:22,560 --> 02:24:25,540
我可以跟他做一笔交易，而且仍然保留我的酒店
I can make a deal with him and still keep my hotel.

1616
02:24:26,010 --> 02:24:28,010
所以你就当众掌掴我哥哥吗？
Is that why you slapped my brother around in public?

1617
02:24:29,580 --> 02:24:31,680
哦，不，那不算什么，麦克
Oh, no, that was nothin', Mike.

1618
02:24:31,690 --> 02:24:34,420
那个…莫那样做没别的意思
Now, now...Moe didn't mean nothin' by that.

1619
02:24:34,430 --> 02:24:36,810
当然他时不时会发火，但是…
Sure he flies off the handle once in a while, but...

1620
02:24:36,880 --> 02:24:38,820
但莫和我是好朋友，对吧，莫？
but Moe and me, we're good friends, right, Moe?

1621
02:24:38,850 --> 02:24:40,450
我要经营生意
I got a business to run.

1622
02:24:40,860 --> 02:24:43,650
我有时候得严厉些，是为了好好经营
I gotta kick asses sometimes to make it run right.

1623
02:24:43,660 --> 02:24:45,260
我们有点小争执，弗雷迪跟我
We had a little argument, Freddy and I

1624
02:24:45,270 --> 02:24:47,310
所以我不得不纠正他
so I had to straighten him out.

1625
02:24:47,690 --> 02:24:49,740
你纠正我哥哥？
You straightened my brother out?

1626
02:24:50,550 --> 02:24:53,110
他一次搞两个鸡尾酒女郎
He was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time!

1627
02:24:53,210 --> 02:24:55,110
赌客在桌上要不到酒
Players couldn't get a drink on the table.

1628
02:24:55,120 --> 02:24:56,310
你有什么毛病？
What's wrong with you?

1629
02:25:01,820 --> 02:25:03,610
我明天动身去纽约
I leave for New York tomorrow.

1630
02:25:04,110 --> 02:25:05,810
考虑一个价钱吧
Think about a price.

1631
02:25:06,070 --> 02:25:07,140
婊子养的
Son of a bitch.

1632
02:25:07,670 --> 02:25:10,340
你知道我是谁吗？我是莫・格林
Do you know who I am? I'm Moe Greene.

1633
02:25:10,370 --> 02:25:13,010
我进家族时你还在跟啦啦队长约会
I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.

1634
02:25:13,030 --> 02:25:15,310
等等，莫，我有个主意
Wait a minute, Moe. Moe, I got an idea.

1635
02:25:16,560 --> 02:25:17,440
汤姆
Tom

1636
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:18,740
汤姆，你是Consigliere
Tom, you're the consigliere.

1637
02:25:18,750 --> 02:25:21,310
- 你可以跟唐说说，你可以解释…  - 等一下
-You can talk to the Don. You can explain...-Just a minute.

1638
02:25:21,810 --> 02:25:25,470
唐已经半退休了，麦克现在负责家族事务
The Don is semiretired. Mike is in charge of the business now.

1639
02:25:25,470 --> 02:25:28,780
你有什么话说，跟迈克尔说吧
If you have anything to say, say it to Michael.

1640
02:25:32,750 --> 02:25:35,050
麦克，你不能到拉斯维加斯来
Mike! You don't come to Las Vegas

1641
02:25:35,060 --> 02:25:37,930
跟莫・格林那种人那样说话
and talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

1642
02:25:39,440 --> 02:25:40,530
弗雷多
Fredo

1643
02:25:41,810 --> 02:25:44,530
你是我哥哥，而且我爱你
You're my older brother, and I love you.

1644
02:25:46,260 --> 02:25:50,360
但是再也别站在外人一边 反对家族了
But don't ever take sides with anyone...against the family again...

1645
02:25:51,630 --> 02:25:52,430
永远
ever.

1646
02:26:00,720 --> 02:26:02,650
我得先去看我父亲和他的手下
I have to see my father and his people.

1647
02:26:02,660 --> 02:26:03,960
所以别等我吃晚饭了
So have dinner without me.

1648
02:26:03,980 --> 02:26:05,530
迈克尔
Oh, Michael.

1649
02:26:06,910 --> 02:26:07,490
这个周末我们出去
This weekend we'll go out.

1650
02:26:07,600 --> 02:26:11,840
我们到城里去，看电影吃饭，我保证
We'll go to the city. We'll see a show and have dinner. I promise.

1651
02:26:19,070 --> 02:26:19,970
迈克尔
Michael.

1652
02:26:20,120 --> 02:26:22,110
迈克尔，你妹妹有事想问你
Michael, your sister wants to ask you something.

1653
02:26:22,130 --> 02:26:23,910
- 让她来问  - 不，她害怕
- Let her ask. - No, she's afraid to.

1654
02:26:24,120 --> 02:26:27,310
康妮和卡洛 想要你当他们孩子的教父
Connie and Carlo want you to be godfather to their little boy.

1655
02:26:27,360 --> 02:26:29,280
- 看情况吧  - 你会当吗？
- We'll see. - Will you?

1656
02:26:29,290 --> 02:26:31,310
让我考虑一下，看情况吧，来吧
Let me think about it. We'll see. Come on.

1657
02:26:38,380 --> 02:26:39,620
所以…
So...

1658
02:26:40,410 --> 02:26:42,960
巴茨尼会先一步对付你
Barzini will move against you first.

1659
02:26:43,420 --> 02:26:47,210
他会与一个你完全信任的人设计一次会面
He'll set up a meeting with someone that you absolutely trust...

1660
02:26:47,970 --> 02:26:50,370
保证你的安全
guaranteeing your safety.

1661
02:26:51,130 --> 02:26:54,630
然后在会面时，你会被暗杀
And at that meeting, you'll be assassinated.

1662
02:26:59,160 --> 02:27:01,410
我越来越比以前爱喝了
I like to drink wine more than I used to.

1663
02:27:03,530 --> 02:27:05,520
总之，我喝得更多了
Anyway, I'm drinking more.

1664
02:27:05,710 --> 02:27:07,440
对你有好处，爸爸
It's good for you, Pop.

1665
02:27:12,070 --> 02:27:13,910
我不知道
I don't know.

1666
02:27:15,580 --> 02:27:18,380
你妻子和孩子，你跟他们快乐吧？
Your wife and children, are you happy with them?

1667
02:27:19,390 --> 02:27:21,020
非常快乐
Very happy.

1668
02:27:21,430 --> 02:27:22,760
那就好
That's good.

1669
02:27:24,090 --> 02:27:29,060
希望你不介意 我一直在谈巴茨尼的事
I hope you don't mind the way I... I keep going over this Barzini business.

1670
02:27:29,130 --> 02:27:30,980
不，一点也不
No, not at all.

1671
02:27:31,120 --> 02:27:32,630
这是个老习惯
It's an old habit.

1672
02:27:33,510 --> 02:27:36,780
我一辈子努力不要粗心
I spent my life tryin' not to be careless.

1673
02:27:38,190 --> 02:27:41,470
女人和小孩能够粗心大意，但男人不行
Women and children can be careless, but not men.

1674
02:27:44,830 --> 02:27:47,340
- 你儿子怎么样？  - 他很好
- How's your boy? - He's good.

1675
02:27:47,360 --> 02:27:50,150
你知道他的样子一天天更像你了
You know, he looks more like you every day.

1676
02:27:52,860 --> 02:27:54,840
他比我聪明
He's smarter than I am.

1677
02:27:55,300 --> 02:27:57,830
三岁就能看漫画了
Three years old, he can read the funny papers.

1678
02:27:59,370 --> 02:28:01,660
他会看漫画
He reads the funny papers.

1679
02:28:08,610 --> 02:28:11,050
我要你安排一个电话公司的人
I want you to arrange to have a telephone man...

1680
02:28:11,060 --> 02:28:14,520
检查每一个进出这里的电话
check all the calls that go in and out of here.

1681
02:28:14,530 --> 02:28:17,820
- 我已经做了，爸  - 可能是任何人  - 爸，我已经处理了
- I did it already. - Could be anyone. - Pa, I took care of that.

1682
02:28:17,910 --> 02:28:20,450
哦，对，我忘了
Oh, that's right. I forgot.

1683
02:28:23,770 --> 02:28:25,390
怎么回事？
What's the matter?

1684
02:28:26,420 --> 02:28:28,260
是什么困扰着你？
What's bothering you?

1685
02:28:31,800 --> 02:28:33,030
我会应付的
I'll handle it.

1686
02:28:34,270 --> 02:28:37,230
我跟你说过我能应付，我会的应付的
I told you I can handle it, I'll handle it.

1687
02:28:49,760 --> 02:28:53,960
我知道桑提诺一定会经历这一切…
I knew that Santino was gonna have to go through all this...

1688
02:28:54,330 --> 02:28:56,440
还有弗雷多
and Fredo--

1689
02:28:58,690 --> 02:29:00,820
弗雷多他…
Fredo was--

1690
02:29:02,660 --> 02:29:06,370
但我从未…我从未想要你来
But I never...I never wanted this for you.

1691
02:29:07,740 --> 02:29:10,570
我工作了一辈子，我不会辩解…
I worked my whole life-- I don't apologize--

1692
02:29:10,580 --> 02:29:12,720
我照顾了我的家人
to take care of my family...

1693
02:29:12,910 --> 02:29:16,100
而且我拒绝当个傻瓜…
and I refused to be a fool...

1694
02:29:16,860 --> 02:29:21,880
随那些大人物的提线起舞
dancing on a string held by all those big shots.

1695
02:29:22,980 --> 02:29:26,690
我不会辩解，那是我的人生，但是我以为…
I don't apologize. That's my life. But I thought that--

1696
02:29:28,180 --> 02:29:34,070
等到了你的时代，你会成为掌握提线的人
that when it was your time... you would be the one to hold the strings.

1697
02:29:35,220 --> 02:29:38,450
参议员柯利昂尼
Senator Corleone.

1698
02:29:38,690 --> 02:29:40,830
州长柯利昂尼之类
Governor Corleone. Something.

1699
02:29:40,840 --> 02:29:43,270
另一个大亨[意大利语]
Another pezzonovante.

1700
02:29:44,030 --> 02:29:45,230
唉…
Well...

1701
02:29:48,630 --> 02:29:52,350
时间还是不够，迈克尔，时间不够
Just wasn't enough time, Michael. Wasn't enough time.

1702
02:29:52,890 --> 02:29:54,450
我们会做到的，爸
We'll get there, Pop.

1703
02:29:55,540 --> 02:29:57,010
我们会做到的
We'll get there.

1704
02:30:01,220 --> 02:30:02,130
听好了…
Now, listen,

1705
02:30:02,340 --> 02:30:05,410
不管谁来邀你去和巴茨尼开会
whoever comes to you with this Barzini meeting...

1706
02:30:05,710 --> 02:30:07,510
他就是叛徒
he's the traitor.

1707
02:30:07,520 --> 02:30:09,360
别忘了这一点
Don't forget that.

1708
02:30:42,990 --> 02:30:44,720
我能给浇这个吗？
Can I water these?

1709
02:30:44,730 --> 02:30:46,740
好的，可以
Yeah. That's fine.

1710
02:30:47,100 --> 02:30:50,710
这边来，这边来
Over here. Over here.

1711
02:30:51,610 --> 02:30:54,540
小心点，你弄洒了，你弄洒了
Be careful. You're spilling it.

1712
02:31:00,350 --> 02:31:04,020
安东尼，过来，过来…
Anthony, come here.

1713
02:31:05,590 --> 02:31:07,140
过来
Come here.

1714
02:31:08,380 --> 02:31:11,430
来，对了，我们把它放在这里
Go ahead. That's right. We'll put it right there.

1715
02:31:17,230 --> 02:31:19,470
我给你看样东西，来
I'll show you something. Come on.

1716
02:31:19,480 --> 02:31:20,630
来
Come on.

1717
02:31:21,550 --> 02:31:23,430
你站在这里
Now, you stand there.

1718
02:31:27,300 --> 02:31:29,400
橙子给我
Give me an orange!

1719
02:31:36,520 --> 02:31:37,610
好了，没事
All right, no.

1720
02:31:47,310 --> 02:31:48,710
这是新把戏
That's a new trick.

1721
02:31:50,330 --> 02:31:53,100
你跑进去，跑进去
You run in there. Run in there.

1722
02:32:06,160 --> 02:32:07,870
- 你在哪？  - 谁？
- Where are you? - Who?

1723
02:35:05,690 --> 02:35:07,880
迈克尔  能借一步说话吗？
Mike, can I have a minute?

1724
02:35:18,010 --> 02:35:20,430
巴茨尼想要安排一次会议
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

1725
02:35:20,520 --> 02:35:23,930
他说我们可以纠正所有问题
He says we can straighten any of our problems out.

1726
02:35:24,740 --> 02:35:26,640
- 你跟他谈过？  - 是的
- You talked to him? - Yeah.

1727
02:35:28,170 --> 02:35:30,230
我能安排安全事宜
I can arrange security...

1728
02:35:30,660 --> 02:35:31,960
在我的地盘上
on my territory.

1729
02:35:34,910 --> 02:35:36,480
好吗？
All right?

1730
02:35:37,110 --> 02:35:39,650
- 好  - 好的
- All right. - All right.

1731
02:35:55,170 --> 02:35:58,030
你知道他们会怎么攻击你吗？
Do you know how they're gonna come at you?

1732
02:36:00,710 --> 02:36:03,000
他们安排在布鲁克林开会
They're arranging a meeting in Brooklyn.

1733
02:36:03,110 --> 02:36:05,160
泰西欧的地盘
Tessio's ground...

1734
02:36:06,400 --> 02:36:08,440
在那里我会安全
where I'll be safe.

1735
02:36:20,520 --> 02:36:23,310
我一直以为会是克里门萨，而不是泰西欧
I always thought it would've been Clemenza, not Tessio.

1736
02:36:24,110 --> 02:36:28,790
这是聪明的一步，泰西欧一向更聪明
It's the smart move. Tessio was always smarter.

1737
02:36:30,290 --> 02:36:32,110
但我会等待
But I'm gonna wait.

1738
02:36:32,810 --> 02:36:35,080
等到洗礼之后
After the baptism.

1739
02:36:37,050 --> 02:36:40,200
我已经决定当康妮小孩的教父了
I've decided to be godfather to Connie's baby.

1740
02:36:41,050 --> 02:36:43,550
然后我再去见唐・巴茨尼
And then I'll meet with Don Barzini...

1741
02:36:44,050 --> 02:36:45,630
还有塔塔利亚
and Tattaglia...

1742
02:36:46,480 --> 02:36:49,280
所有五大家族的首领
all the heads of the five families.

1743
02:37:26,200 --> 02:37:27,780
阿门

1744
02:39:10,290 --> 02:39:11,710
迈克尔，你相信上帝吗？
Michael, do you believe in God...

1745
02:39:11,720 --> 02:39:15,350
全能的天父，天地的创造者？
the Father Almighty, creator of Heaven and Earth?

1746
02:39:15,370 --> 02:39:16,410
我相信
I do.

1747
02:39:16,610 --> 02:39:20,090
你相信耶稣基督，他的独子，我们的主吗？
Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord?

1748
02:39:20,100 --> 02:39:21,300
我相信
I do.

1749
02:39:21,310 --> 02:39:25,420
你相信圣灵，神圣的天主教堂吗？
Do you believe in the holy Ghost, the holy Catholic Church?

1750
02:39:25,480 --> 02:39:26,860
我相信
I do.

1751
02:40:32,320 --> 02:40:34,480
迈克尔・弗兰西斯・里奇
Michael Francis Rizzi,

1752
02:40:34,490 --> 02:40:37,160
你弃绝撒旦吗？
do you renounce Satan?

1753
02:40:43,090 --> 02:40:44,770
我弃绝他
I do renounce him.

1754
02:40:54,160 --> 02:40:56,310
以及他所有的作为吗？
And all his works?

1755
02:41:09,220 --> 02:41:10,640
我弃绝它们
I do renounce them.

1756
02:41:16,200 --> 02:41:18,140
以及他所有的浮华？
And all his pomps?

1757
02:41:18,380 --> 02:41:20,240
我弃绝它们
I do renounce them.

1758
02:41:35,610 --> 02:41:37,720
迈克尔・里奇
Michael Rizzi,

1759
02:41:37,780 --> 02:41:39,810
你愿意受洗吗？
will you be baptized?

1760
02:41:39,820 --> 02:41:41,340
我愿意
I will.

1761
02:41:48,460 --> 02:41:50,530
迈克尔・里奇，平平安安
Michael Rizzi, go in peace.

1762
02:41:50,540 --> 02:41:54,340
愿主与你同在，阿门
And may the Lord be with you. Amen.

1763
02:42:07,830 --> 02:42:09,370
凯伊
Kay.

1764
02:42:10,040 --> 02:42:11,220
这是你的教父
This is your godfather.

1765
02:42:36,310 --> 02:42:37,210
卡洛
Carlo.

1766
02:42:37,850 --> 02:42:38,340
什么？
What?

1767
02:42:38,380 --> 02:42:39,760
不能去维加斯了
Can't go to Vegas.

1768
02:42:39,770 --> 02:42:42,330
临时有要事，大家得跟我们留下
Something's come up. Everybody's gonna have to leave with us.

1769
02:42:42,340 --> 02:42:45,280
- 哦，麦克，这是我们第一次一起度假  - 喂，康妮，拜托
- Oh, Mike, it's our first vacation together. - Hey, Connie, please.

1770
02:42:45,290 --> 02:42:48,180
- 你要我怎么做  - 回家去等我电话，有要事
- What do you wanna do? - Go back to the house. Wait for my call. It's important.

1771
02:42:48,190 --> 02:42:49,820
好的
All right.

1772
02:42:50,230 --> 02:42:52,420
我只需一两天
I'll only be a couple of days.

1773
02:42:55,220 --> 02:42:57,140
旅途愉快，妈
Have a nice trip, Mama.

1774
02:43:08,770 --> 02:43:10,550
我们上路去布鲁克林了
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

1775
02:43:13,020 --> 02:43:15,510
我希望麦克今晚能给我们谈个好交易
I hope Mike can get us a good deal tonight.

1776
02:43:15,520 --> 02:43:16,630
他一定会的
I'm sure he will.

1777
02:43:24,660 --> 02:43:25,940
萨尔、汤姆
Sal, Tom,

1778
02:43:25,950 --> 02:43:27,900
老板说他另外坐车来
the boss says he'll come in a separate car.

1779
02:43:27,910 --> 02:43:29,880
说叫你们先走
He says for you two to go on ahead.

1780
02:43:30,080 --> 02:43:31,090
见鬼，他不能那么做
Hell, he can't do that.

1781
02:43:31,100 --> 02:43:33,720
- 弄乱了我所有的安排  - 他是这么说的
-It screws up all my arrangements. -That's what he said.

1782
02:43:33,730 --> 02:43:35,480
我也不能去了，萨尔
I can't go either, Sal.

1783
02:43:47,830 --> 02:43:50,370
告诉麦克这只是生意
Tell Mike it was only business.

1784
02:43:50,720 --> 02:43:52,630
我一直都喜欢他
I always liked him.

1785
02:43:53,540 --> 02:43:54,500
他会理解的
He understands that.

1786
02:43:54,510 --> 02:43:56,120
抱歉，萨尔
Excuse me, Sal.

1787
02:44:02,420 --> 02:44:04,700
汤姆，你能帮我脱身吗？
Tom, can you get me off the hook?

1788
02:44:05,880 --> 02:44:09,160
- 看在老交情的份上  - 我办不到，萨利
- For old times' sake. - Can't do it, Sally.

1789
02:44:54,520 --> 02:44:57,180
你得为桑提诺负责，卡洛
You have to answer for Santino, Carlo.

1790
02:45:02,180 --> 02:45:06,340
- 麦克，你全搞错了  - 你替巴茨尼的人挑拨了桑尼
-Mike, you got it all wrong. -You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people.

1791
02:45:07,720 --> 02:45:10,310
你对我妹妹演的那场小闹剧
That little farce you played with my sister.

1792
02:45:11,030 --> 02:45:12,820
你以为那能骗得过柯利昂尼家的人吗？
Did you think that could fool a Corleone?

1793
02:45:12,840 --> 02:45:14,230
麦克，我是清白的
Mike, I'm innocent.

1794
02:45:14,240 --> 02:45:16,190
我以孩子们起誓
I swear on the kids.

1795
02:45:16,200 --> 02:45:18,970
- 求你，麦克，别这样对我  - 坐下
- Please, Mike, don't do this to me. - Sit down there.

1796
02:45:21,910 --> 02:45:24,230
麦克，别这样对我，求你
Mike, don't do this to me, please.

1797
02:45:33,360 --> 02:45:35,010
巴茨尼死了
Barzini's dead.

1798
02:45:37,010 --> 02:45:38,450
菲利普・塔塔利亚也是
So is Phillip Tattaglia...

1799
02:45:40,710 --> 02:45:41,810
莫・格林
Moe Greene

1800
02:45:43,110 --> 02:45:44,000
斯特拉奇
Strachi...

1801
02:45:45,960 --> 02:45:47,520
科尼奥
Cuneo.

1802
02:45:48,640 --> 02:45:50,490
今天我解决家族全部事务
Today I settle all family business,

1803
02:45:50,500 --> 02:45:53,430
所以别跟我说你是清白的，卡洛
so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.

1804
02:45:54,170 --> 02:45:55,390
承认你所做的
Admit what you did.

1805
02:45:59,890 --> 02:46:01,050
给他一杯酒
Get him a drink.

1806
02:46:07,990 --> 02:46:08,850
说吧
Come on.

1807
02:46:10,420 --> 02:46:12,620
别害怕，卡洛
Don't be afraid, Carlo.

1808
02:46:12,830 --> 02:46:15,360
得了，你以为我会让我妹妹当寡妇？
Come on, you think I'd make my sister a widow?

1809
02:46:16,980 --> 02:46:19,730
我是你儿子的教父，卡洛
I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.

1810
02:46:26,530 --> 02:46:28,770
来，喝吧，喝吧
Go ahead, drink. Drink.

1811
02:46:33,610 --> 02:46:37,460
不，卡洛，你退出家族生意，这是给你的惩罚
Now, Carlo, you're out of the family business. That's your punishment.

1812
02:46:38,370 --> 02:46:42,150
你结束了，我送你上飞机去维加斯
You're finished. I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.

1813
02:46:42,410 --> 02:46:43,340
汤姆
Tom.

1814
02:46:48,240 --> 02:46:50,850
我要你留在那边，明白吗？
I want you to stay there. Understand?

1815
02:46:51,870 --> 02:46:54,850
只是别告诉我你是清白的
Only don't tell me you're innocent...

1816
02:46:55,780 --> 02:46:58,510
因为那侮辱了我的智力
because it insults my intelligence.

1817
02:46:58,830 --> 02:47:00,750
让我非常生气
It makes me very angry.

1818
02:47:04,210 --> 02:47:06,630
现在，是谁接洽的你？
Now, who approached you?

1819
02:47:07,500 --> 02:47:09,520
塔塔利亚还是巴茨尼？
Tattaglia or Barzini?

1820
02:47:17,800 --> 02:47:19,410
是巴茨尼
It was Barzini.

1821
02:47:23,660 --> 02:47:24,830
好
Good.

1822
02:47:31,330 --> 02:47:34,410
外面有辆车等着 送你去机场
There's a car waiting for you outside to take you to the airport.

1823
02:47:35,460 --> 02:47:38,090
我会打电话给你妻子，告诉她说你坐哪班飞机
I'll call your wife, tell her what flight you're on.

1824
02:47:43,460 --> 02:47:46,430
- 请你，我…   - 快走，滚出我的视线
- Please, can I-- - Come on. Get out of my sight.

1825
02:48:12,030 --> 02:48:13,430
你好，卡洛
Hello, Carlo.

1826
02:49:10,460 --> 02:49:13,050
- 你别哭了行吗？  - 你想告诉我什么？
- Will you stop crying?  - What are you trying to tell me?

1827
02:49:13,070 --> 02:49:16,930
- 我想告诉你…  - 噢，妈妈，拜托
- I'm telling you you're wrong. - Mama, please!

1828
02:49:25,030 --> 02:49:27,280
迈克尔…
Michael.

1829
02:49:27,290 --> 02:49:29,780
- 怎么了？  - 他在哪儿？迈克尔！
- What is it?  - Where is he? Michael!

1830
02:49:31,670 --> 02:49:36,310
迈克尔，你这恶心的混蛋，你杀了我丈夫
Michael, you lousy bastard! You killed my husband!

1831
02:49:36,760 --> 02:49:39,320
你等到爸爸死后，没人能阻止你了
You waited until Papa died so nobody could stop you...

1832
02:49:39,340 --> 02:49:40,900
然后你就杀了他
and then you killed him!

1833
02:49:40,910 --> 02:49:42,380
你把桑尼的死怪罪于他
You blamed him for Sonny.

1834
02:49:42,390 --> 02:49:43,980
你一直都是，大家都是
You always did. Everybody did.

1835
02:49:43,990 --> 02:49:45,940
但你从未替我想过
But you never thought about me!

1836
02:49:45,950 --> 02:49:47,930
你从来不管我
You never gave a damn about me!

1837
02:49:47,940 --> 02:49:50,100
现在我该怎么办？
Now what am I gonna do?

1838
02:49:50,110 --> 02:49:51,310
康妮
Connie.

1839
02:49:53,980 --> 02:49:56,650
你以为他为什么要把卡洛留在林荫道？
Why do you think he kept Carlo at the mall?

1840
02:49:56,680 --> 02:49:59,470
一直以来他就知道自己要杀他
All the time he knew he was gonna kill him.

1841
02:49:59,630 --> 02:50:02,510
你还照样当我们孩子的教父
And you stood godfather to our baby.

1842
02:50:02,520 --> 02:50:04,830
你这恶心冷血的混蛋
You lousy, coldhearted bastard.

1843
02:50:05,040 --> 02:50:07,600
想知道跟卡洛一起 他杀了多少人吗？
Want to know how many men he had killed with Carlo?

1844
02:50:07,610 --> 02:50:09,120
看看报纸吧 看看报纸吧
Read the papers! Read the papers!

1845
02:50:09,130 --> 02:50:12,630
那就是你丈夫，那就是你丈夫…
That's your husband! That's your husband!

1846
02:50:21,840 --> 02:50:25,890
不！不！不！
No! No! No!

1847
02:50:25,890 --> 02:50:27,680
- 带她上楼  - 不！不！
- Take her upstairs. - No! No!

1848
02:50:28,220 --> 02:50:29,720
- 给她找个医生  - 老天
-Get her a doctor.-Oh, God!

1849
02:50:50,440 --> 02:50:52,110
她歇斯底里了
She's hysterical.

1850
02:50:56,870 --> 02:50:58,510
歇斯底里
Hysterical.

1851
02:51:00,330 --> 02:51:01,740
迈克尔，是真的吗？
Michael, is it true?

1852
02:51:04,170 --> 02:51:06,150
别问我的公事，凯伊
Don't ask me about my business, Kay.

1853
02:51:06,330 --> 02:51:07,750
是真的吗？
Is it true?

1854
02:51:07,860 --> 02:51:09,580
别过问我的公事
Don't ask me about my business.

1855
02:51:09,590 --> 02:51:11,700
- 不  - 够了
-No. -Enough!

1856
02:51:30,810 --> 02:51:32,620
好吧
All right.

1857
02:51:35,070 --> 02:51:36,960
只此一次
This one time.

1858
02:51:40,880 --> 02:51:44,040
就这一次我让你问我的公事
This one time, I'll let you ask me about my affairs.

1859
02:51:50,390 --> 02:51:51,530
是真的吗？
Is it true?

1860
02:51:55,730 --> 02:51:56,410
是吗？
