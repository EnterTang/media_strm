2
00:07:34,739 --> 00:07:36,691
把它们想象成这样就行
Just picture them as this.

3
00:07:38,215 --> 00:07:41,491
作为地球上仅存安置点人类
As sons and daughters of possibly the sole remaining

4
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,495
的子女
human settlement on earth.

5
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:48,759
你们是人类存亡的关键
You're a critical part of what stands between us and extinction.

6
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:52,375
因此  你们有义务安全返回
Therefore, you have an obligation to return to us safely.

7
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,563
只要牢记训练内容
And if you remember your training,

8
00:07:54,572 --> 00:07:55,579
你们就能做到
you will.

9
00:07:55,595 --> 00:07:59,452
祝你们好运  一路平安  天佑美国
Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America.

10
00:07:59,822 --> 00:08:02,341
美利坚!  美利坚!
USA! USA!

11
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,890
出发吧
Let's go!

12
00:08:19,873 --> 00:08:21,890
[墙上的字:欢迎来到死亡之区!  保持警惕!] 
Welcome to the Dead Zone! Look alive out there!

13
00:08:21,905 --> 00:08:23,530
不错嘛!
Sweet!

14
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,289
Berg  你到底过不过来帮忙啊?
Hey Berg, are you gonna help us out or what?

15
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,010
不过去  我快打到第五级了
No, I don't. I'm almost at level five.

16
00:09:53,105 --> 00:09:54,429
你们听到了吗?
Did you hear that?

17
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,925
我听到了
I did.

18
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,455
我们应该离开这儿
We should bail.

19
00:09:58,483 --> 00:10:00,915
这怎么行  我们不能跑  我们有任务
Oh, hey, we can't just bail. We have orders.

20
00:10:00,923 --> 00:10:02,548
你知道整个城市一个月
Do you have any idea how much medicine 

21
00:10:02,548 --> 00:10:03,657
要消耗多少药品吗?
this city goes through a month? 

22
00:10:03,673 --> 00:10:06,155
人们需要药物存活  我们不能跑...
We need pharmaceutics to survive. We can't just bail or...

23
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:07,770
天哪  你怎么和我爸口气一样
God, you sound just like my dad.

24
00:10:07,786 --> 00:10:08,786
谢谢
Thank you.

25
00:10:08,805 --> 00:10:10,420
我可不是在夸你
Yeah, it was not a compliment.

26
00:10:10,915 --> 00:10:14,586
伙计们  来点百忧解吧  说不定能让你们兴奋点
Oh here, guys. Take some Prozac. It might cheer you up.

27
00:10:17,691 --> 00:10:19,583
我说了我听到了声响
I told you, I heard something.

28
00:10:22,742 --> 00:10:24,210
Perry  我们撤吧
Perry, let's bail.

29
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:29,785
Perry!


30
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:32,544
我们有任务在身  Julie
We have orders, Julie.

31
00:10:33,305 --> 00:10:34,965
反正也不会是什么
It was nothing anyway.

32
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:37,215
你肯定是在大惊小怪
You're being paranoid, okay?

33
00:10:37,238 --> 00:10:38,035
Perry!


34
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,396
瞄准他们头部!
Aim for the head!

35
00:11:42,695 --> 00:11:43,795
好漂亮的手表!
Nice watch!

36
00:11:47,527 --> 00:11:49,190
我并不以此为豪
Now I'm not proud of this.

37
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,404
而且我希望这会儿
In fact, I'd appreciate it

38
00:11:50,405 --> 00:11:52,709
你能略过这段  看看别处
if you might look away for a moment here.

39
00:11:52,729 --> 00:11:54,849
我并不喜欢伤害人类
I do not like hurting people.

40
00:11:54,885 --> 00:11:56,853
但没办法  现在世道就是这样
But this is the world now.

41
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:01,240
渴求活肉的新饿潮让大家欲罢不能
The new hunger is a very powerful thing.

42
00:12:02,402 --> 00:12:05,816
如果我不把他全部吃掉  留下他的大脑
If I don't eat all of him, if I spare his brain,

43
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:08,577
他会重新站起来  成为我这样的行尸走肉
He will rise up and become a corpse like me.

44
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:10,065
不过  如果我吃了他
But if I do ...

45
00:12:10,086 --> 00:12:12,500
我就会有他的记忆  他的思想
I get his memories, his thoughts.

46
00:12:12,517 --> 00:12:14,543
他的感受
His feelings.

47
00:12:17,469 --> 00:12:19,563
我很抱歉  可是我忍不住
I'm sorry, I just can't help it.

48
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,067
大脑是精华部分
The brain is the best part,

49
00:12:21,068 --> 00:12:23,235
它让我有重新为人的感觉
the part that makes me feel human again.

50
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,756
喜欢这烟花吗  Perry?
You like it, Perry ?

51
00:12:32,314 --> 00:12:34,276
我不想伤害你
I do not wanna hurt you.

52
00:12:35,108 --> 00:12:38,108
我只是想感受你的感受
I just wanna feel what you felt.

53
00:38:39,403 --> 00:38:41,445
- 谢谢  - 我可不是在夸你
- Thank you. - Yeah, it was not a compliment.

54
00:38:41,468 --> 00:38:42,913
我说了我听到了声响
I told you I heard something.

55
00:38:44,022 --> 00:38:45,131
Perry!


56
00:38:46,111 --> 00:38:47,443
瞄准他们头部
Aim for the head!

57
00:39:59,349 --> 00:40:01,462
你说了只是几天而已
You said a few days.

58
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,746
已经过去很多天了
It's been a few days.

59
00:40:06,157 --> 00:40:08,255
我必须回家
I have to go home.

60
00:40:10,084 --> 00:40:13,704
要...待在一起
S... stay together.

61
00:40:15,174 --> 00:40:17,037
外面不安全
It isn't safe.

62
00:40:20,949 --> 00:40:22,202
搞什么!
What!

63
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,335
这是Julie
It's Julie.

64
00:40:25,294 --> 00:40:26,649
活人
Living.

65
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,734
吃了她
Eat.

66
00:40:31,779 --> 00:40:33,290
吃掉
Eat!

67
00:40:34,626 --> 00:40:35,973
吃掉
Eat!

68
00:40:43,547 --> 00:40:45,019
噢  我的天啊
Oh, my God.

69
00:40:45,691 --> 00:40:47,093
我们走
We go.

70
00:40:50,051 --> 00:40:51,294
吃掉
Eat.

71
00:41:32,561 --> 00:41:34,268
这边
This way.

72
00:41:51,903 --> 00:41:53,742
跟我走
Come with me.

73
00:41:54,723 --> 00:41:55,750
什么?
What?

74
00:41:56,225 --> 00:41:57,346
不
No.

75
00:41:59,793 --> 00:42:01,522
只是想...帮忙
Want to ... help.

76
00:42:01,593 --> 00:42:03,131
谁叫你帮了?
Who the hell ask you?

77
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:04,337
我...
I...

78
00:42:04,368 --> 00:42:05,873
...喜欢她
...like her.

79
00:42:09,675 --> 00:42:11,734
没事的
It's okay.

80
00:42:12,565 --> 00:42:13,982
才怪嘞
Sure it is.

81
00:42:16,926 --> 00:42:19,445
- 去那边  停车场  - 马上到
- Over there, the garage. - Hold on.

82
00:42:29,633 --> 00:42:32,414
噢  现在看到你真高兴
Oh, I'm so happy to see you right now.

83
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,631
你没事吧?
You okay?

84
00:42:41,128 --> 00:42:43,405
呃...R?
Oh...R?

85
00:43:43,728 --> 00:43:45,395
你...开车
You...drive.

86
00:43:45,415 --> 00:43:46,645
好主意
Good idea.

87
00:44:54,999 --> 00:44:56,600
天啊  好冷啊
Jesus... I'm freezing.

88
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:00,912
我得靠边停一下
I'll have to pull over.

89
00:45:02,482 --> 00:45:05,713
这应该是我爸指挥撤离的最后一个街区了
This would be the last neighborhood my dad evacuated.

90
00:45:05,739 --> 00:45:08,297
我们得找个房子然后吃点东西
We need to get to a house and have some food.

91
00:45:20,529 --> 00:45:22,384
噢  天啊
Oh, God.

92
00:45:25,218 --> 00:45:26,729
好了  来
Okay, come on.

93
00:45:30,183 --> 00:45:31,702
噢  锁着的
Oh man, it is locked.

94
00:46:02,697 --> 00:46:05,067
噢  酷
Oh, cool.

95
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:07,771
看他们有这个诶
Look what they have.

96
00:46:07,818 --> 00:46:09,649
宝丽莱拍立得
Obsolete polaroid.

97
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:12,207
茄子!
Cheese!

98
00:46:15,141 --> 00:46:17,854
没事的  看?
It's all right, see?

99
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:21,098
是吧
Yeah.

100
00:46:22,299 --> 00:46:25,125
记录回忆是很重要的  知道不?
It is important to preserve memories, you know?

101
00:46:25,138 --> 00:46:28,674
尤其是世界即将灭亡的当下
Especially now with the world is on its way out.

102
00:46:32,219 --> 00:46:35,622
眼前的一切  都可能是最后一次看到
Everything you see, you may be seeing for the last time.

103
00:46:35,645 --> 00:46:37,731
Perry以前常这么说
Perry used to say that.

104
00:46:39,431 --> 00:46:41,656
给  照张相吧
Here. Take a picture.

105
00:46:58,999 --> 00:47:00,609
我累极了
I'm exhausted.

106
00:47:02,298 --> 00:47:05,785
楼上的床铺还不坏  我去睡觉了
The bed upstairs isn't too rum , so I'm gonna go to sleep.

107
00:47:06,834 --> 00:47:07,991
晚安
Good night.

108
00:47:15,757 --> 00:47:16,901
R


109
00:47:18,655 --> 00:47:21,487
听着  R  我在想...
Look, R, I was thinking ...

110
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:24,300
其实你可以...
You know, you could ...

111
00:47:24,701 --> 00:47:27,291
也睡在那如果你想的话
Sleep in there if you want.

112
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:29,442
睡地板上
On the floor.

113
00:47:30,798 --> 00:47:33,051
这房子挺吓人的  所以...
This house has creeped me out, so ...

114
00:47:36,197 --> 00:47:37,216
好吧
Okay.

115
00:00:29,424 --> 00:00:31,424
我脸色太苍白了  应该多出去走走
I'm so pale. I should get out more.

116
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,204
我应该吃好点  现在这样子真差劲
I should eat better. My posture is terrible.

117
00:00:34,223 --> 00:00:35,939
应该站直一点
I should stand up straighter.

118
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:39,015
我要是昂首挺胸  别人也会更尊重我
People would respect me more if I stood up straighter.

119
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,749
我到底是怎么了?  我只想和人交流而已
What's wrong with me? I just want to connect.

120
00:00:41,763 --> 00:00:44,149
但为什么不行呢?
Why can't I connect with people?

121
00:00:44,164 --> 00:00:45,481
哦  想起来了
Oh, right.

122
00:00:45,497 --> 00:00:46,993
因为我已经死了
It's because I'm dead.

123
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,620
其实没必要为难自己
I shouldn't be so hard on myself.

124
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:50,075
毕竟大家都是死人
I mean, we're all dead.

125
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:52,321
这女孩是死人  那家伙是死人
This girl is dead. That guy is dead.

126
00:00:52,328 --> 00:00:54,516
角落里那哥们肯定也是死人
That guy in the corner is definitely dead.

127
00:00:54,525 --> 00:00:56,118
天啊  这群人看起来糟透了
Jesus, these guys look awful.

128
00:01:00,825 --> 00:01:02,627
真希望能做个自我介绍
I wish I could introduce myself,

129
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:04,711
可惜我忘了自己名字
but I don't remember my name anymore.

130
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:07,243
我猜它是个"R"开头的词
I mean, I think it's started with an "R",

131
00:01:07,244 --> 00:01:08,546
但也仅此而已了
but that's all I have left.

132
00:01:08,562 --> 00:01:11,811
我记不起自己的名字  父母或是生前的工作
I can not remember my name or my parents or my job.

133
00:01:11,845 --> 00:01:14,895
尽管从这身装扮来看  我生前可能没工作
Although my hoodie would suggest I was unemployed.

134
00:01:16,013 --> 00:01:19,668
有时我会看着其他同伴  想象他们生前是什么身份
Sometimes I look at the others and try to imagine what they were.

135
00:01:20,615 --> 00:01:22,234
你大概是清洁工
You were a janitor.

136
00:01:27,605 --> 00:01:30,431
你可能是某集团总裁家的贵公子
You were the rich son of a corporate CEO.

137
00:01:33,532 --> 00:01:34,624
你也许是...
You were ...

138
00:01:35,366 --> 00:01:36,909
私人健身教练
A personal trainer.

139
00:01:41,242 --> 00:01:43,224
但现在只是具僵尸
Now you're a corpse.

140
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:45,430
有段时间  我很想搞清楚
I found a hard time piecing together

141
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,648
这种末日之灾发生的原因
how this whole apocalypse thing happened.

142
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:50,176
可能是生化战争  或是空气传染病
Could have been chemical warfare, or airborne virus,..

143
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:52,399
亦或是放射性物质大爆发产生的畸形生物
or a radioactive outbreak monkey.

144
00:01:53,127 --> 00:01:56,027
但都不重要了  我们成了僵尸  接受现实吧
But it doesn't really matter. This is what we are now.

145
00:01:57,873 --> 00:01:59,709
这是我作为僵尸的普通一天
This is a typical day for me.

146
00:01:59,732 --> 00:02:02,451
我趿着步子  偶尔会撞到人
I shuffled around, occasionally bumping into people.

147
00:02:02,465 --> 00:02:05,510
但我无法向被撞到的人道歉  或是说点什么
Unable to apologize, or say much of anything.

148
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:11,464
生前时光肯定比现在好得多
It must have been so much better before.

149
00:02:11,492 --> 00:02:13,800
那时候大家都可以尽情说话
When everyone could express themselves,

150
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,339
能够畅快交谈
communicate their feelings

151
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,461
喜欢有人陪伴
And just enjoy each other's company.

152
00:02:25,015 --> 00:02:26,401
我的许多同类
A lot of us had made our

153
00:02:26,402 --> 00:02:28,942
都在这个机场里安家  我不明白个中缘由
home here at this airport. I don't know why.

154
00:02:28,963 --> 00:02:31,101
可能是在等着什么吧
People waited at the airport, I guess.

155
00:02:31,102 --> 00:02:33,633
但僵尸又能在这里等什么呢
But I'm not sure what we are all waiting for.

156
00:02:39,851 --> 00:02:42,770
哦天哪  大家叫这伙人"皮包骨"
Oh man. They call these guys "Boneys".

157
00:02:43,218 --> 00:02:44,691
他们一般不骚扰我们
They don't bother us much.

158
00:02:44,692 --> 00:02:47,016
以一切有心跳的活物为食
But they'd eat anything with a heartbeat.

159
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,845
虽然我也是
I mean, I will too,

160
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:51,173
但至少我有些抵触
but at least I'm conflicted about it.

161
00:02:51,197 --> 00:02:53,141
可能哪天  我们也会变成"皮包骨"
We'll all become them someday.

162
00:02:53,164 --> 00:02:55,198
如果放任不管就会变成那样吧   
At some point you just give up, I guess.

163
00:02:55,214 --> 00:02:58,237
先是失去了希望  之后一步步  再也不能回头
You lose all hope. After that, there is no turning back.

164
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:03,444
天哪真恶心  停下停下  别刨了  只会更丑
Oh, man. Gross. Stop, stop, dont pick it. You're making it worse.

165
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:06,315
这就是我以后要过的日子
This is what I have to look forward to.

166
00:03:07,213 --> 00:03:09,171
真扫兴
It's kind of a bummer.

167
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,680
我不想这么过
I don't want to be this way.

168
00:03:12,722 --> 00:03:14,743
我很孤独  找不到方向
I'm lonely, I'm lost.

169
00:03:15,047 --> 00:03:16,481
现在是真找不着方向了
I mean, I'm literally lost.

170
00:03:16,482 --> 00:03:19,192
之前没来过机场的这片区域
I've never been in this part of the airport before.

171
00:03:20,004 --> 00:03:22,435
这也是俩迷途的小孩
These guys are lost too.

172
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,202
四处乱晃但永远到不了什么地方
Wandering around but never getting anywhere.

173
00:03:25,224 --> 00:03:26,909
他们是不是感觉不自由?
Did they feel trapped?

174
00:03:26,925 --> 00:03:28,424
是不是想过更好的生活?
Did they want more than this?

175
00:03:30,631 --> 00:03:32,281
难道只有我这么想吗?
Am I the only one?

176
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,506
这是我的死党
This is my best friend.

177
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,436
所谓死党  我俩也就偶尔对着哼哼
By best friend I mean we occasionally grunted..

178
00:05:00,437 --> 00:05:03,429
或笨拙地盯着对方而已
and stared awkwardly at each other.

179
00:05:05,474 --> 00:05:08,082
间或可以称得上是在交谈
We even have almost a conversation sometimes.

180
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,406
每天都这样
Days passed this way.

181
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:34,473
但有时  我们能说出完整的词
But sometimes, we even find the actual words ...

182
00:05:34,694 --> 00:05:36,711
比如  "好饿"
Words like: Hungry.

183
00:05:38,107 --> 00:05:41,155
- 或者  - "城市"
- And... - City.

184
00:05:50,723 --> 00:05:52,594
虽然我们无法交流
Even though we can't communicate,

185
00:05:52,595 --> 00:05:54,582
但我们对食物的喜好相同
we do share similar taste in food.

186
00:05:54,591 --> 00:05:56,795
结伴出去觅食是正确的选择
Travelling in pack is kinda make sense.

187
00:05:56,803 --> 00:05:58,309
尤其是当外面的人类  不论老幼
Especially when everyone and their grandmother's

188
00:05:58,309 --> 00:05:59,904
都想打爆你的头时
trying to shoot you in the head all the time.

189
00:06:06,078 --> 00:06:08,563
天啊  我们走的真慢
God, we move slow.

190
00:06:11,024 --> 00:06:13,425
估计得花不少时间
This could take a while.

191
00:07:00,057 --> 00:07:02,827
大家好  感谢你们今天的辛苦工作
Hello, and thank you for your service today.

192
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:06,024
媒体报道  自从这一瘟疫摧毁了我们的世界
In media, ever since this plague destoyed our world,

193
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:08,263
你觉得有可能找到治愈的方子吗
Do you think we're getting the stuff for the cure?

194
00:07:08,264 --> 00:07:09,761
"这个世界的存亡..."
And the survival of our world ...

195
00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:12,290
没人会相信有解药了  Julie
No one believes in a cure anymore, Julie.

196
00:07:12,323 --> 00:07:14,243
"依靠你们这样的志愿者
For volunteers like you,

197
00:07:14,274 --> 00:07:17,451
从隔离墙外搜集资源"
to gather resources from beyond the wall.

198
00:07:17,483 --> 00:07:19,561
但首先  提醒一句
But first a word of caution.

199
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:21,831
僵尸看起来像人类  但是它们不是
Corpses look human, they are not.

200
00:07:21,843 --> 00:07:24,170
它们不会思考  不会流血
They do not think, they do not bleed.

201
00:07:24,185 --> 00:07:25,714
即使它们曾是你的母亲
Whether they were your mother

202
00:07:25,715 --> 00:07:28,194
或你最好的朋友  你现在已不可能挽救它们了
or your best friend, they are beyond your help.

203
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,831
它们无情无义  
They are uncaring, unfeeling..

204
00:07:30,854 --> 00:07:32,807
不知悔改
incapable of remorse.

205
00:07:32,824 --> 00:07:34,737
听起来还真像我认识的某人啊  老爸
Sounds like someone I know, Dad.

206
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:45,006
让我好受一些
To feel a little better.

207
00:12:45,824 --> 00:12:47,417
让我有一些生气
A little less dead.

208
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:09,610
Perry  我想我爱你
Perry, I think I love you.

209
00:13:12,927 --> 00:13:14,611
说话呀
Say something.

210
00:13:16,153 --> 00:13:18,211
别什么都不说
Don't you say nothing...

211
00:13:18,227 --> 00:13:19,082
不  我...
No, I'm...

212
00:13:20,181 --> 00:13:22,315
我也爱你  Julie
I think I love you too, Julie.

213
00:13:32,715 --> 00:13:34,163
我很怀念飞机
I miss airplanes.

214
00:13:35,551 --> 00:13:38,282
我妈妈曾经说  飞机在天上看着像是蚀刻素描
My mom used to say that it looked like an Etch a Sketch up there.

215
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,312
是啊
Yeah.

216
00:13:40,832 --> 00:13:42,733
我很高兴你记着那些事
I like that you remember that kind of stuff.

217
00:13:43,467 --> 00:13:44,972
如果你不记着  它们就会...
If you don't, it's just...

218
00:13:45,002 --> 00:13:47,721
随风而逝了
All be gone, you know.

219
00:13:50,976 --> 00:13:52,643
是啊  这个世界一片混乱
Yeah, the world is so messed up.

220
00:13:53,735 --> 00:13:55,301
也不全是
Not all of it.

221
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:57,964
芝士球
Cheese ball!

222
00:14:04,466 --> 00:14:05,503
Perry.


223
00:14:07,996 --> 00:14:09,064
Perry!


224
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:13,389
Perry  你在哪儿? 回答我!
Perry, where are you? Answer me!

225
00:15:14,971 --> 00:15:16,198
Ju... lie...


226
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,205
安全...
Safe...

227
00:15:58,823 --> 00:15:59,904
过来...
Come...

228
00:16:23,851 --> 00:16:25,520
我不知道自己在做什么
I don't know what I'm doing.

229
00:16:25,692 --> 00:16:27,448
我是怎么了?
What's wrong with me?

230
00:16:30,308 --> 00:16:33,627
这些家伙绝不会带活人回家的
These other guys will never bring a living person home.

231
00:16:33,637 --> 00:16:36,253
你知道为什么吗? 疯子才做这种傻事
You know why? Because that's crazy.

232
00:16:36,584 --> 00:16:39,506
现在  他们以为她是我们的一员
Right now, they think she's just another one of us.

233
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:41,508
新的家庭成员
A new addition to the family.

234
00:16:41,528 --> 00:16:43,723
如果他们能思考
They would think I was insane.

235
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,712
会认为我疯了
If they could think.

236
00:16:45,935 --> 00:16:48,488
为什么一切如此诡异?
Why life has to be so weird?

237
00:16:48,626 --> 00:16:50,269
我到底在做什么?
What am I doing?

238
00:17:28,362 --> 00:17:29,963
到家了
Home.

239
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,930
不...
Not...

240
00:18:15,351 --> 00:18:16,744
吃...
Eaten...

241
00:18:25,767 --> 00:18:26,956
让你...
Keep...

242
00:18:27,255 --> 00:18:28,801
...安全
...you safe.

243
00:19:02,956 --> 00:19:03,978
好吧
All right,

244
00:19:03,997 --> 00:19:06,449
或许我能想得更清楚点
maybe I could have thought this through a little more.

245
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,299
我看得出女孩这时候需要独处
I can tell when a girl needs her space.

246
00:19:10,379 --> 00:19:12,537
要想了解一个人有很多种方式
There's a lot of ways to get to know a person.

247
00:19:12,566 --> 00:19:14,459
吃掉她死去男友的大脑
Eating her dead boyfriend's brain

248
00:19:14,478 --> 00:19:17,110
是一种最极端的方式  不过...
is one of the more unorthodox methods, but...

249
00:19:27,558 --> 00:19:29,853
今天是个特殊的日子
This is a special occasion.

250
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:31,759
特殊的日子?
A special occasion, Sir?

251
00:19:31,783 --> 00:19:33,416
今天是我妈妈的生日
It's my mom's birthday.

252
00:19:36,126 --> 00:19:37,954
- 为Diane  - 为妈妈
- To Diane. - To mom.

253
00:19:38,096 --> 00:19:39,057
是的
Yep.

254
00:19:40,797 --> 00:19:44,829
Perry  Julie说你做农业方面的工作?
So Perry, Julie tells me you've been working in agriculture?

255
00:19:44,848 --> 00:19:45,803
但你没想过
But tell me you would

256
00:19:45,804 --> 00:19:48,956
要和你爸爸去做建筑方面的工作吧
never consider going to work construction with your father?

257
00:19:48,956 --> 00:19:51,258
隔离墙那里我们很缺人手
You know, on The Wall we need good people.

258
00:19:51,283 --> 00:19:53,331
别理他  Perry
Don't mind him, Perr.

259
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:55,323
我爸爸拯救人类的方案是
Dad's idea in saving humanity...

260
00:19:55,331 --> 00:19:57,151
建一个巨大的混凝土箱子
is to build a really big concrete box,

261
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:58,349
让大家都待在里面
put everyone in it,

262
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:01,631
然后举着枪守护在门口  直到我们老去  死去
and then wait at the door with guns until we grow old and die.

263
00:20:02,249 --> 00:20:05,455
Julie  没有隔离墙  我们现在就是在吃人脑了
Well, Julie, without the wall we would be eating...

264
00:20:05,473 --> 00:20:07,368
而不是吃饭
brains now instead of rice.

265
00:20:07,391 --> 00:20:08,518
爸爸
Dad.

266
00:20:09,926 --> 00:20:11,801
这是穿过隔离墙的唯一通道
This is the only way to pass The Wall,

267
00:20:11,823 --> 00:20:13,638
否则我们就过不去了
Otherwise we just stopped.

268
00:20:15,455 --> 00:20:16,843
- 走吗?  -好的
- Okay?  - Okay.

269
00:20:21,628 --> 00:20:22,792
来吧
Come on.

270
00:20:23,314 --> 00:20:24,720
没关系  来呀
It's not that bad, come on.

271
00:20:26,627 --> 00:20:28,918
我两天没听到我爸的消息了  Julie
I haven't heard from him for two days, Julie.

272
00:20:28,964 --> 00:20:31,942
他正忙隔离墙的施工  Perry  他在工作
He's on construction detail, Perry. He's working.

273
00:20:31,977 --> 00:20:34,115
我爸能几周不跟我联系
My Dad goes weeks without checking in.

274
00:20:40,796 --> 00:20:43,015
好了  轻点走
Okay, come quietly.

275
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,425
嘿
Hey.

276
00:20:46,724 --> 00:20:48,230
没事的
It's gonna be okay.

277
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,935
嗯
Yeah.

278
00:21:17,021 --> 00:21:18,046
爸爸
Dad.

279
00:21:25,924 --> 00:21:27,027
Perr...
Perr...

280
00:21:47,124 --> 00:21:48,663
快点  我们走
Come on, let's go.

281
00:21:51,263 --> 00:21:53,044
难怪她那么怕我
No wonder she's so afraid of me.

282
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:56,724
我得换个方式了
I need a different approach.

283
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,078
好  我来了
Okay, here we go.

284
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:02,251
别吓人  别吓人  别吓人
Don't be creepy, don't be creepy, don't be creepy.

285
00:22:18,484 --> 00:22:20,198
你要做什么?
What are you doing?

286
00:22:23,955 --> 00:22:26,322
请让我一个人待着
Please leave me alone.

287
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,589
为什么?
Why me?

288
00:22:43,374 --> 00:22:45,686
你为什么救我?
Why did you save me?

289
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,343
别...
Don't...

290
00:22:50,128 --> 00:22:52,455
哭
...cry.

291
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,083
保护
Safe ...

292
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:27,291
保护你
Keep you safe.

293
00:23:40,651 --> 00:23:42,343
你是什么?
What are you?

294
00:24:50,596 --> 00:24:52,104
我饿了
I am hungry.

295
00:24:55,007 --> 00:24:56,671
放我走
Just let me go.

296
00:24:57,828 --> 00:24:59,492
不...不安全
N-N-Not safe.

297
00:24:59,695 --> 00:25:01,015
不安全?
Not safe?

298
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:04,183
啊  不安全
Ah, it's not safe.

299
00:25:06,758 --> 00:25:09,398
那你得去给我弄点吃的
Well then you're just gonna have to go and get me some food.

300
00:25:10,106 --> 00:25:11,550
因为我快饿死了
Because I'm starving.

301
00:25:16,858 --> 00:25:18,138
求你了...
Please ...

302
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:21,486
有点吃的我会很感激你的
I would be very grateful for some food.

303
00:25:24,052 --> 00:25:25,668
好的
Okay

304
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,002
天啊!
God!

305
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:21,726
糟了!
Shit!

306
00:26:37,271 --> 00:26:38,231
别...
Don't...

307
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:40,633
跑...
Run...

308
00:26:56,975 --> 00:26:58,929
来  安全
Come. Safe.

309
00:26:59,996 --> 00:27:01,078
谢谢
Thank you.

310
00:27:12,128 --> 00:27:13,662
装死人
Be dead.

311
00:27:19,196 --> 00:27:20,158
会吗?
Okay?

312
00:27:29,006 --> 00:27:30,256
太夸张了
It's too much.

313
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:45,364
我告诉过你
I told you ...

314
00:27:45,596 --> 00:27:47,348
不...安全
Not...safe.

315
00:27:48,135 --> 00:27:50,026
是的  我明白了
Yeah, I get that.

316
00:27:52,107 --> 00:27:54,259
但我真的很饿
I really am hungry though.

317
00:27:56,468 --> 00:27:57,497
太棒了
Yes!

318
00:28:02,687 --> 00:28:03,838
唔天哪
Hmm, my God.

319
00:28:10,721 --> 00:28:11,800
哦! 不!
Oh, no!

320
00:28:11,824 --> 00:28:14,571
别盯着人家! 你又举止怪异了
Stop staring! You're acting weird again.

321
00:28:40,127 --> 00:28:41,564
谢谢
Thank you.

322
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:53,966
啊  哎...
Oh, man ...

323
00:28:54,074 --> 00:28:57,222
我都不记得上一次喝啤酒是什么时候了
Can't remember the last time I had a beer.

324
00:28:57,943 --> 00:29:00,481
你也坏不到哪儿去嘛  僵尸先生
You can't be all that bad, Mister Zombie.

325
00:29:01,709 --> 00:29:03,427
我的...
My...

326
00:29:04,674 --> 00:29:06,447
名字...
Name...

327
00:29:07,273 --> 00:29:09,194
你也有名字吗?
You have a name?

328
00:29:10,044 --> 00:29:12,059
你叫什么?
What is your name?

329
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,461
Rrr...


330
00:29:16,503 --> 00:29:17,487
R什么?
Rrr?

331
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,218
现阶段进展很不顺利
This stage is not going well.

332
00:29:19,231 --> 00:29:21,082
我恨不得再死一遍
I want to die all over again.

333
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,325
你名字的首字母是R吗?
Did your name start with R?

334
00:29:27,702 --> 00:29:28,826
是Robert吗?
Robert?

335
00:29:28,993 --> 00:29:30,344
还是Richard?
Richard?

336
00:29:31,234 --> 00:29:33,000
Randy?  呃...
Randy? Uh ...

337
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,990
是不是Raphael?  或者Ricardo?
Raphael? Ricardo?

338
00:29:38,055 --> 00:29:40,211
要不我就叫你R好了
Why don't I just call you R?

339
00:29:42,818 --> 00:29:45,126
好歹也算个开始  是不是
I mean, that's a start, right?

340
00:29:47,901 --> 00:29:49,978
R  我想回家了
I want to go home, R.

341
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,513
外面不安全
Not safe.

342
00:29:56,536 --> 00:29:58,340
这个我明白
I get that.

343
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:00,359
而且  听着
And look ...

344
00:30:01,318 --> 00:30:05,107
我知道你救了我的命  我也对此很感激
I know that you saved my life and I'm grateful for that.

345
00:30:05,592 --> 00:30:07,519
但是是你带我走进这个地方的
But you walked me into this place.

346
00:30:07,526 --> 00:30:09,881
所以我知道你也能再带着我走出去
So I know that you can walk me out again.

347
00:30:09,889 --> 00:30:12,316
哦不  她不能走  她才刚刚来到这里呢
Oh, no! She can't leave, she's just got here.

348
00:30:12,324 --> 00:30:15,253
快告诉她必须得等  快告诉她  其他僵尸会注意到的
Tell her she has to wait, tell her ... they'll notice.

349
00:30:16,497 --> 00:30:17,528
你必须...
You have...

350
00:30:18,178 --> 00:30:19,256
得等着
to wait.

351
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:23,425
他们...会...
They... will...

352
00:30:23,566 --> 00:30:24,987
注意到你的
Notice...

353
00:30:25,092 --> 00:30:26,888
哼  说的还不错嘛
Heh, not bad.

354
00:30:27,276 --> 00:30:28,680
等多久
How long?

355
00:30:29,106 --> 00:30:31,175
就...几天
Few... days.

356
00:30:33,925 --> 00:30:36,924
他们会...逐渐忘了你的存在
They'll.. forget.

357
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:40,263
然后...你就会没事了
You'll... be okay.

358
00:30:42,989 --> 00:30:45,150
还有其他像你一样的僵尸么
Are there others like you?

359
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:48,934
我是说...
I mean...

360
00:30:49,267 --> 00:30:51,922
我从来都没听说过僵尸还会说话的
I've never ever heard a corpse talking before.

361
00:30:53,121 --> 00:30:56,292
我指的是...  除了呻吟之外
I mean, apart from, you know... groaning.

362
00:31:04,165 --> 00:31:05,313
好吧
Okay.

363
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:07,504
就几天  是吧?
Few days, huh?

364
00:31:11,512 --> 00:31:15,040
那这几天困在这个鬼地方  我又能做些什么呢
And what am I supposed to do in a few days around here anyway.

365
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:21,271
这真是太棒了
This is awesome!

366
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,539
你也想来试试吗?
Do you wanna try?

367
00:31:50,624 --> 00:31:51,991
我的天...
Oh, God...

368
00:31:53,009 --> 00:31:54,478
有点耐心
Oh, wait for it.

369
00:31:55,343 --> 00:31:58,150
打住  打住...  选一只脚踩油门
Okay, okay... pick a foot.

370
00:31:58,175 --> 00:32:00,852
你这是两只脚一起开车  只能选一只  
You're using two feet, pick... Pick one foot.

371
00:32:02,698 --> 00:32:03,705
这还差不多
There you go.

372
00:32:07,502 --> 00:32:08,304
对喽
There you go!

373
00:32:16,747 --> 00:32:19,331
好的  现在两只手都放在方向盘上
Allright, two hands on the wheel.

374
00:32:36,803 --> 00:32:39,232
我的天  R
Jesus, R!

375
00:32:39,804 --> 00:32:42,303
你把这么漂亮的车撞坏了
This was a beautiful car!

376
00:33:03,224 --> 00:33:04,918
这么多唱片是怎么回事?
What's with all the vinyl?

377
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:07,260
你没学会怎么用iPod吗?
Couldn't figure out how to work an iPod?

378
00:33:07,339 --> 00:33:10,609
(唱片)听起来...效果更好
Better...sound.

379
00:33:11,014 --> 00:33:13,279
哈  你还是个纯粹主义者  是不?
Ah, you're a purist, eh?

380
00:33:13,336 --> 00:33:14,609
(听唱片)让我觉得...
More...

381
00:33:16,915 --> 00:33:18,336
更有活力...
Alive...

382
00:33:18,378 --> 00:33:20,393
嗯  那倒是
Yeah, that's true.

383
00:33:20,422 --> 00:33:22,999
但是麻烦多多
Lot more trouble though.

384
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,944
你看看  你刚刚又耸肩了
There you go again, shrugging.

385
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,405
别老耸肩  你个耸肩癖
Stop shrugging, shrugger!

386
00:33:28,443 --> 00:33:30,716
你总是做这样模棱两可的动作
It's really not a committal gesture.

387
00:33:32,506 --> 00:33:33,537
又来?
Really?

388
00:33:36,452 --> 00:33:38,389
你这些唱片都很酷
These are really cool records.

389
00:33:38,423 --> 00:33:40,435
你上哪儿找的这么多?
How did you get all these?

390
00:33:40,459 --> 00:33:43,099
我...喜欢收集东西
I... collect things.

391
00:33:43,139 --> 00:33:45,009
是的  这我看得出来
Yeah, I can see that.

392
00:33:45,062 --> 00:33:47,632
我的朋友  你真是个可怕的存在
You, my friend, are a horror.

393
00:33:50,382 --> 00:33:53,865
我知道一家超棒的唱片店
I know this awesome record store.

394
00:33:54,795 --> 00:33:56,685
你一定会很喜欢  那家店可酷了
You'll love it, that's so cool.

395
00:33:57,951 --> 00:33:59,586
是被毁之前很酷
Was so cool.

396
00:34:02,231 --> 00:34:02,968
好嘞
All right then.

397
00:34:07,861 --> 00:34:09,451
现在好多了
Much better.

398
00:35:42,091 --> 00:35:45,970
R  我可以问你一件事吗?
R, can I ask you something?

399
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,879
我男朋友...
My boyfriend...

400
00:35:50,058 --> 00:35:52,227
他死在那里了
He died back there,

401
00:35:52,701 --> 00:35:54,474
他还会回来吗?
Will he come back

402
00:35:55,126 --> 00:35:56,602
会变成你这样的僵尸回来么?
as one of you?

403
00:36:00,323 --> 00:36:01,989
也许这样就很好了  
That's good, I guess.

404
00:36:06,241 --> 00:36:08,420
他经历过一些事
Something happened to him.

405
00:36:10,174 --> 00:36:12,630
他经历过了很多事
A lot of things happened to him.

406
00:36:12,909 --> 00:36:16,284
但可能熬到一定程度  他终究是
But I guess there just came a point where

407
00:36:16,532 --> 00:36:19,649
扛不住了吧
he couldn't aborb anymore.

408
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,832
只不过  在我的世界里
It's just ... in my world,

409
00:36:23,218 --> 00:36:25,225
总有人离开我死去
people die all the time.

410
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:28,708
所以  并不是
So, you know, it's not like

411
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:32,198
他死了我一点都不难过
I'm not sad that he's gone.

412
00:36:33,338 --> 00:36:34,781
我其实很伤心
Because I am.

413
00:36:35,765 --> 00:36:37,670
但我也许一直都在
But I think I have been...

414
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,958
为这一天到来做准备
preparing for it,

415
00:36:40,496 --> 00:36:42,613
而且准备很久很久了
for a really long time.

416
00:37:25,925 --> 00:37:27,980
你到底是什么?
What are you?

417
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,944
哇  睡觉一定很舒服吧
Man, it must be nice to sleep.

418
00:37:46,072 --> 00:37:47,688
我希望我能睡着
I wish I could.

419
00:37:47,934 --> 00:37:49,511
我希望我能做梦
I wish I could dream.

420
00:37:49,799 --> 00:37:51,798
这只是奢望  我没得选择
That's not really an option for me.

421
00:37:52,032 --> 00:37:53,703
死人没法做梦
The dead don't dream.

422
00:37:53,774 --> 00:37:55,914
这是我们做的最贴近做梦的事情了
This is as closest as we get.

423
00:38:03,691 --> 00:38:06,105
你确定吗  孩子?
You sure about this, son?

424
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,806
那么  欢迎你的加入
Welcome then.

425
00:38:13,455 --> 00:38:15,282
对于你痛失至亲  我很难过
Sorry for your loss.

426
00:38:15,713 --> 00:38:17,196
我也是
Me too.

427
00:38:18,065 --> 00:38:20,119
给他也拿一把  然后教他怎么使用
Get him one and show him how to use it.

428
00:38:24,762 --> 00:38:26,710
Berg  你到底来不来这儿帮忙啊?
Hey Berg, are you gonna help us out or what?

429
00:38:26,711 --> 00:38:27,854
我快到第五级了
I'm almost at level five.

430
00:38:29,504 --> 00:38:30,893
你们听到了吗
Did you hear that?

431
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,615
我听到了 我们应该离开这儿
I did. We should bail.

432
00:38:33,775 --> 00:38:35,916
我们不能跑  我们有任务
We can not just bail. We have orders.

433
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,154
你怎么和我爸口气一样
You sound just like my dad.

434
00:48:42,358 --> 00:48:43,314
你...
D'you...

435
00:48:43,639 --> 00:48:44,720
你...
D'you...

436
00:48:44,801 --> 00:48:45,859
感觉到了么?
Feel it?

437
00:48:48,489 --> 00:48:49,737
你是不是...
Do you...

438
00:48:49,753 --> 00:48:50,995
感觉到了...
feel it ...

439
00:48:51,009 --> 00:48:52,262
是不?
Yeah?

440
00:50:05,499 --> 00:50:07,713
我嘞个去  是我爸
Holy shit, it's my dad.

441
00:50:07,778 --> 00:50:09,258
退后!
Get back!

442
00:50:16,996 --> 00:50:18,757
他会杀了你的
He would have killed you.

443
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:23,798
如果他看到你  他肯定会一枪打在你头上
If he'd saw you, he would have shot you in the head.

444
00:50:25,331 --> 00:50:27,225
然后你就永远的去了
And you're just begone.

445
00:50:32,883 --> 00:50:35,870
这些衣服还是湿的
These clothes are soaking still,

446
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:39,951
我得把它们铺开晾干
I'm gonna lay them out to dry.

447
00:50:41,657 --> 00:50:43,708
别紧张!
Oh, relax!

448
00:50:45,581 --> 00:50:47,057
我勒个去!
Holy shit!

449
00:50:53,507 --> 00:50:54,800
别看
Don't look.

450
00:50:55,793 --> 00:50:56,874
好吧
Okay.

451
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,219
我勒个去!
Holy shit!

452
00:51:12,634 --> 00:51:13,865
嘿
Hey.

453
00:51:15,517 --> 00:51:17,505
你是不是必须要吃人啊?
Do you have to eat people?

454
00:51:18,317 --> 00:51:19,797
是的
Yeah.

455
00:51:20,329 --> 00:51:21,880
要不然你就会死?
Or you'll die?

456
00:51:25,097 --> 00:51:27,584
- 是  - 但是你并没有吃了我
- Yup - But you didn't eat me.

457
00:51:29,966 --> 00:51:31,688
你救了我
You rescued me,

458
00:51:32,334 --> 00:51:34,768
很多次
Like... a bunch.

459
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:42,604
被困在里面肯定很难过吧
It must be hard being stuck in there.

460
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,120
我看到你在努力
And I can see you trying,

461
00:51:45,533 --> 00:51:47,333
人类就是这样的
That's what people do.

462
00:51:47,788 --> 00:51:49,822
我们总是努力变得更好
You know, we try to be better.

463
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,927
有时候我会觉得有些厌倦
Sometimes I get sick of it a little bit.

464
00:51:55,778 --> 00:51:57,539
但是看看你...
But look at you...

465
00:51:57,941 --> 00:52:00,015
你努力多了
You try so much harder than

466
00:52:00,377 --> 00:52:03,131
比任何我所知的人类都努力
any human you might have seen.

467
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:08,227
你是个好人  R
You're a good person, R.

468
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:15,088
无论如何
Anyway.

469
00:52:15,928 --> 00:52:18,353
是我干的
It was me.

470
00:52:20,157 --> 00:52:22,387
什么是你干的?
What was you?

471
00:52:44,819 --> 00:52:46,725
我想说
I mean...

472
00:52:47,375 --> 00:52:50,824
- 自己其实隐约知道了吧  - 你知道?
- I guess I kind of knew that.  - You did?

473
00:52:54,799 --> 00:52:56,406
嗯
Yeah.

474
00:52:56,633 --> 00:52:59,223
我倒是希望不是你干的
I guess I hope that you didn't.

475
00:53:01,508 --> 00:53:03,019
抱歉
I'm sorry.

476
00:53:05,754 --> 00:53:07,719
Julie...


477
00:53:09,614 --> 00:53:13,493
我真的很...  抱歉
I'm so... sorry.

478
00:53:41,936 --> 00:53:43,815
死人是不睡觉的
The dead do not sleep.

479
00:54:03,997 --> 00:54:06,318
假设这世上的工作任你们挑
If you guys can have any job in the world,

480
00:54:07,685 --> 00:54:10,410
而且一切都和现在不同
and pretend that everything is totally different.

481
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:13,261
你们会想做什么?
What would you want to do?

482
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:17,691
- 看护  - 是么?
- Nursing. - Yeah?

483
00:54:17,718 --> 00:54:18,707
嗯
Yeah.

484
00:54:19,728 --> 00:54:21,250
治病
Healing people,

485
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:24,182
救人
Saving lives.

486
00:54:25,639 --> 00:54:28,580
还有就是找到...  找到治愈良药
Yeah, and finding... finding a cure.

487
00:54:29,594 --> 00:54:30,965
这个我喜欢
I like that.

488
00:54:31,416 --> 00:54:32,492
我觉得总有一天  会有人
I think someday someone's

489
00:54:32,493 --> 00:54:34,302
找出解决的方法  然后...
gonna figure out this whole thing, and...

490
00:54:34,867 --> 00:54:36,613
在全世界到处发掘
Exhume the world.

491
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:38,044
发掘?
Exhume?

492
00:54:38,055 --> 00:54:40,183
那是什么意思?
And... and what does that mean?

493
00:54:41,154 --> 00:54:44,843
- 发掘以后复活  - 意思是挖掘
- Exhume means to like revive. - It means to dig up

494
00:54:44,873 --> 00:54:47,373
把僵尸挖出来复活
as in digging up a corpse.

495
00:54:48,012 --> 00:54:49,732
随你怎么理解
Whatever!

496
00:54:50,888 --> 00:54:53,349
你在这干什么呢?
What the hell are you doing here?

497
00:54:56,615 --> 00:54:59,923
哇  你现在是真的在做梦么?
Woah, are you actually dreaming right now?

498
00:55:00,364 --> 00:55:03,595
- 我不确定  - 僵尸  你是不能做梦的
- I'm not sure. - You can't dream, corpse.

499
00:55:03,853 --> 00:55:06,434
- 人类才能做梦  - 冷静点  Perry
- Dreaming is for humans. - Chill out, Perry.

500
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:09,644
他要是想就可以做梦
He can dream if he wants to.

501
00:55:12,463 --> 00:55:14,112
你呢  R?
What about you, R?

502
00:55:15,279 --> 00:55:16,720
你有想做的事情么?
What do you wanna be?

503
00:55:17,205 --> 00:55:18,482
我不知道
I don't know.

504
00:55:19,051 --> 00:55:20,640
我都不知道我是谁
I don't even know who I am.

505
00:55:20,667 --> 00:55:22,719
只要你想  就可以成为任何人
You can be whatever you want.

506
00:55:23,493 --> 00:55:25,441
大家不都这么说的么?
Isn't that what they say?

507
00:55:25,458 --> 00:55:28,412
我们都可以  对吧?  你和我一起吗?
We can, right? You and me?

508
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:31,295
绝不可能  小白脸
It's not gonna happen, loverboy.

509
00:55:31,318 --> 00:55:34,149
在你告诉她你吃了她前男友后就不可能了
Not after you told her you ate her ex.

510
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:41,396
耸一下肩
Shrug.

511
00:56:41,617 --> 00:56:44,790
别做梦了  你不能想当什么就当什么
So much for dreaming. You can't be whatever you want.

512
00:56:44,812 --> 00:56:47,476
一直以来我都是行动缓慢  脸色苍白
All I ever be is a slow, pale,

513
00:56:47,494 --> 00:56:49,368
弯腰驼背  目光死寂的僵尸而已
Hunched-over, dead-eyed zombie.

514
00:56:49,389 --> 00:56:50,413
我在妄想什么
What I think is going to happen

515
00:56:50,413 --> 00:56:52,288
指望她会留下来和我在一起吗?
that she'd actually want to stay with me?

516
00:56:52,317 --> 00:56:53,533
没用的
It's helpless.

517
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:55,505
奢求太多就只能是如此下场
This is what I get for wanting more.

518
00:56:55,527 --> 00:56:57,588
我应该满足现状
I should just be happy with what I had.

519
00:56:57,589 --> 00:56:59,861
接受境况一成不变的现实
Things don't change, I need to accept that.

520
00:56:59,885 --> 00:57:01,985
麻木不仁反而更容易度日
It's easier not to feel.

521
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:03,732
然后我就不会像现在这样难过了
And I would not have to feel like this.

522
00:58:08,108 --> 00:58:10,619
- 报上名来  - 是我  Kevin
- Identify yourself!  - It's just me, Kevin.

523
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:13,455
- 没事了  我很好  - 别动
- It's okay, I'm fine.  - Just stop right there!

524
00:58:14,265 --> 00:58:15,552
没事的
It's okay.

525
00:58:15,578 --> 00:58:18,481
- 我没被感染  - 我说别动  Julie
- I'm not infected.  - I said stop, Julie.

526
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:21,724
好吧  好吧
Okay, fine, fine.

527
00:58:33,999 --> 00:58:35,031
她还好吗?
Is she okay?

528
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:35,764
没问题  长官
Clear, Sir.

529
00:58:36,076 --> 00:58:36,900
爸爸
Hi, dad.

530
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:39,190
我派了六组人去找你
I sent half a dozen units out looking for you.

531
00:58:39,210 --> 00:58:42,211
- Nora说你被带进...  - 是的
- Nora said you were taken into...  - Yes, I was.

532
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:47,337
我逃了出来  沿途躲进房子躲在郊外  然后...
I escaped, I was holed up in houses, suburbs and...

533
00:58:47,572 --> 00:58:50,649
找到辆车  回来了
I found a car, so I came here.

534
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:53,141
Julie  你确定没被咬?
Julie, are you sure nothing bit you?

535
00:58:53,177 --> 00:58:56,732
- 爸  你看我像被感染了吗?  - 我们得确保安全
- Do I look infected to you, Dad? - We have to be safe.

536
00:58:56,761 --> 00:58:58,553
是的  我明白
Yeah, I know, I know.

537
00:58:59,376 --> 00:59:01,840
我发誓我没事
I'm fine, though, I promise.

538
00:59:03,637 --> 00:59:05,955
我以为失去你了
I thought I lost you.

539
00:59:06,831 --> 00:59:08,503
你没失去我  爸爸
Well you didn't, Dad.

540
00:59:09,278 --> 00:59:10,485
我回来了
I'm here.

541
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:12,161
欢迎回家
Welcome home.

542
00:59:13,072 --> 00:59:15,263
是啊  回来真好
Yeah, good to be back.

543
00:59:33,632 --> 00:59:35,820
我要回家  调整一下
So I'm just going to go home. I'm gonna blend in.

544
00:59:35,835 --> 00:59:37,764
别想那么多
I'm gonna stop thinking so much.

545
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:39,410
我要忘了她
I'm gonna forget about her.

546
00:59:39,439 --> 00:59:41,733
像我忘掉其他事一样把她忘了
Just like I forget about everything else.

547
00:59:41,766 --> 00:59:43,404
我要...
I'm gonna...

548
00:59:43,427 --> 00:59:45,100
见鬼  好冷
Oh, shit, I'm cold.

549
00:59:45,128 --> 00:59:46,804
这就是寒冷的感觉么?
Is that what this is?

550
00:59:46,837 --> 00:59:50,007
- 僵尸明明感受不到冷  - 喂
- Corpses don't get cold.  - Yo.

551
01:00:12,519 --> 01:00:14,562
我们...  来这里
We... coming here.

552
01:00:16,431 --> 01:00:19,161
皮包骨们把我赶了出来
Boneys, they chased me out,

553
01:00:20,572 --> 01:00:22,193
到处找你
came to find you.

554
01:00:22,845 --> 01:00:24,219
她在哪里?
Where is she?

555
01:00:24,574 --> 01:00:26,210
回家了
Went home.

556
01:00:34,936 --> 01:00:37,986
- 你还好吧?  - 不好
- Are you okay?  - No.

557
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:49,521
婊子无情  老弟
Bitches, man.

558
01:00:55,621 --> 01:00:59,710
皮包骨们...  正在...  找你
Boneys... are looking... for you.

559
01:01:03,479 --> 01:01:04,826
还有她...
And her...

560
01:01:06,114 --> 01:01:08,649
她触发了...  什么...
She started... something...

561
01:01:11,461 --> 01:01:12,793
我看见了...
I saw...

562
01:01:14,397 --> 01:01:15,885
图像...
pictures...

563
01:01:16,441 --> 01:01:18,163
就在昨晚...
last night...

564
01:01:19,773 --> 01:01:21,855
回忆起...
Memories...

565
01:01:22,922 --> 01:01:24,265
我妈妈...
My mom...

566
01:01:25,863 --> 01:01:27,640
夏天...
Summer time...

567
01:01:28,855 --> 01:01:30,449
奶油...
Cream...

568
01:01:31,634 --> 01:01:33,306
小麦...
Wheat...

569
01:01:35,749 --> 01:01:36,932
一个女孩...
A girl...

570
01:01:37,707 --> 01:01:40,457
- 是梦  - 梦?
- Dream!  - A dream?

571
01:01:42,003 --> 01:01:44,443
我们...  正有所转变
We are... changing things.

572
01:01:46,709 --> 01:01:48,845
- 没错  - 是的
- We are.  - We are.

573
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:56,380
我得告诉她
I have to tell her.

574
01:01:59,470 --> 01:02:01,465
你们帮我吗?
Will you help?

575
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:06,227
帮我
Help.

576
01:02:07,952 --> 01:02:09,815
找她?
Exhume?

577
01:02:15,552 --> 01:02:17,414
他们说...
They said...

578
01:02:19,623 --> 01:02:21,048
这他妈没问题
fuck yeah.

579
01:02:53,487 --> 01:02:54,906
在这儿等
Wait here.

580
01:02:58,664 --> 01:03:00,036
小心
Be careful.

581
01:03:01,163 --> 01:03:02,463
好的
Okay.

582
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:10,785
那...  我会在这儿等
So... I'll wait here.

583
01:03:36,248 --> 01:03:37,791
没关系  来呀
It's not that bad, come on.

584
01:03:58,111 --> 01:03:59,862
Julie和我给大家带来了希望
Julie and I were giving the others hope.

585
01:03:59,882 --> 01:04:01,604
并且迅速蔓延开来
And it was spreading fast.

586
01:04:01,621 --> 01:04:03,248
我猜皮包骨不愿乐见其成
I guess the Boneys didn't like that,

587
01:04:03,249 --> 01:04:05,102
所以才要找我们
that must be why they are looking for us.

588
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,549
我得告诉Julie
I have to tell Julie,

589
01:04:06,572 --> 01:04:09,410
我得和她解释发生了什么  免得为时已晚
I have to explain what is happening before it is too late.

590
01:04:09,441 --> 01:04:12,358
我必须这么做  哦  不
I have to. Oh, no. Oh, no.

591
01:04:12,386 --> 01:04:14,820
去  找你的朋友去  嘘!  快走
Please, go. Go with your friends. Shoo!

592
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:16,857
离我远点  就这样  很好
Leave me. That's it, okay.

593
01:04:53,161 --> 01:04:55,297
不  我是说真的  Nora
No, I'm serious, Nora!

594
01:04:55,310 --> 01:04:59,639
僵尸不过是我们随便想的蠢名字
I mean, corpse's just a stupid name that we came up with

595
01:04:59,639 --> 01:05:01,773
去称呼那些我们不能理解的事物
for a state of being we do not understand.

596
01:05:03,068 --> 01:05:04,446
好吧
Yeah.

597
01:05:04,490 --> 01:05:06,236
天啊
My God!

598
01:05:07,149 --> 01:05:09,332
我这是怎么了?
What is wrong with me?

599
01:05:10,542 --> 01:05:11,827
好吧  我...
Okay, I...

600
01:05:12,938 --> 01:05:14,676
我得跟你说件事儿
I gotta tell you something.

601
01:05:14,692 --> 01:05:17,179
很诡异  别被吓到
This is kinda weird, please do not freak out.

602
01:05:17,197 --> 01:05:18,221
不会的
No.

603
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:19,487
但是...
But...

604
01:05:20,488 --> 01:05:22,672
我真的很想他
I actually miss him.

605
01:05:24,231 --> 01:05:26,197
你...  你想他?
You... you miss him?

606
01:05:26,212 --> 01:05:27,697
- 我对他没兴趣...  - 类似于...
- I'm not interested in him...  - Like ...

607
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:29,978
你喜欢他
Like you're attracted to him.

608
01:05:29,994 --> 01:05:33,044
就像他能当你男朋友的那种喜欢
Like he could be your boyfriend.

609
01:05:33,689 --> 01:05:35,838
当你的呆瓜小僵尸男友?
Your zombie zombie boyfriend?

610
01:05:37,167 --> 01:05:40,436
我知道现在很难遇见新的男生
I know it's really hard to meet guys right now with

611
01:05:40,472 --> 01:05:43,312
我很肯定  因为世界末日什么的
the apocalypse and stuff, trust me.

612
01:05:43,338 --> 01:05:45,827
我知道你想念Perry...
And I know you miss Perry...

613
01:05:45,843 --> 01:05:48,304
好吗?  但Julie  这太诡异了
Okay? But Julie, this is weird.

614
01:05:48,324 --> 01:05:49,525
就像...
Like...

615
01:05:49,554 --> 01:05:50,844
我还希望网络能用
I wish the internet would still working,

616
01:05:51,019 --> 01:05:53,297
可以上网查查你到底怎么回事
so I could just look up whatever it is that's wrong with you.

617
01:05:53,876 --> 01:05:55,520
闭嘴
Shut up.

618
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:56,999
好吧
All right.

619
01:05:57,653 --> 01:05:58,882
好的
Okay.

620
01:05:58,902 --> 01:06:01,007
我要睡了
I'm getting ready for bed.

621
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:02,356
嘿...
Hey...

622
01:06:03,778 --> 01:06:05,414
很高兴你回来了
I'm glad you're back.

623
01:06:06,344 --> 01:06:07,605
嗯
Yeah.

624
01:06:07,963 --> 01:06:10,740
做个关于你那僵尸的美梦
Have sweet dreams about your zombie.

625
01:06:10,943 --> 01:06:12,626
好吧
All right.

626
01:06:50,031 --> 01:06:51,753
Julie.


627
01:06:52,136 --> 01:06:53,772
Julie.


628
01:06:58,214 --> 01:06:59,749
R


629
01:07:01,136 --> 01:07:03,147
你来这儿干什么?
What are you doing here?

630
01:07:03,852 --> 01:07:05,785
我来见你
I came to see you.

631
01:07:06,474 --> 01:07:07,728
R


632
01:07:08,177 --> 01:07:10,524
你不能就这样跑过来
You can't just do that.

633
01:07:11,172 --> 01:07:13,066
很危险
It's dangerous.

634
01:07:13,823 --> 01:07:16,357
Griggio  闭嘴  我要睡觉
Griggio, shut up, I'm trying to sleep.

635
01:07:17,345 --> 01:07:18,911
对不起
Sorry.

636
01:07:19,443 --> 01:07:21,025
上帝呀  R
Jesus, R!

637
01:07:21,388 --> 01:07:22,914
你疯了吗?
Are you crazy?

638
01:07:23,182 --> 01:07:25,779
这儿的人不像我
The people here, they are not like me.

639
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:30,040
如果看见你会杀了你  你知道吗?
If they see you, you will get killed. You understand that?

640
01:07:31,956 --> 01:07:33,011
我知道
Yes.

641
01:07:33,092 --> 01:07:35,736
- 你在自言自语吗?  - 没有
- Are you talking to yourself?  - No!

642
01:07:35,832 --> 01:07:38,890
说真的  到底怎么了  Julie?
Seriously, what is going on here, Julie?

643
01:07:42,174 --> 01:07:43,756
噢  天啊
Oh, my God!

644
01:07:44,172 --> 01:07:45,894
就是他么?
Is that him?

645
01:07:46,265 --> 01:07:47,940
是啊
Yeaah.

646
01:07:52,228 --> 01:07:53,762
你好呀
(What)'s up?

647
01:07:57,524 --> 01:07:59,199
对不起
I'm sorry.

648
01:08:00,949 --> 01:08:04,679
我知道  我也很抱歉
I know. I'm sorry too.

649
01:08:13,011 --> 01:08:15,093
其实我很想你
I actually missed you.

650
01:08:16,402 --> 01:08:18,015
我也是
Me too.

651
01:08:20,324 --> 01:08:23,688
有意思  你比我记忆中要温暖
It's funny, you're warmer than I remember.

652
01:08:27,882 --> 01:08:29,411
是巡逻队
It's the patrol.

653
01:08:29,610 --> 01:08:31,090
快点  进来
Come on, get inside.

654
01:08:37,108 --> 01:08:38,408
来啊
Come on.

655
01:08:39,150 --> 01:08:42,512
你很走运  我爸爸被叫去处理紧急事件了
You're lucky my Dad got pulled into some emergency thing.

656
01:08:43,674 --> 01:08:46,397
今晚你在这里很安全  R
You're safe here tonight, R.

657
01:08:46,426 --> 01:08:49,356
可过了今晚  我就不知道该怎么办了
After that, I do not know what we're gonna do.

658
01:08:51,811 --> 01:08:53,518
你是怎么死的?
How did you die?

659
01:08:54,348 --> 01:08:56,227
我不...  记得了
I don't... remember.

660
01:08:56,242 --> 01:08:58,239
你多大了?
How old are you?

661
01:08:58,257 --> 01:09:00,375
因为你可能二十几岁
Because you could be 20-something.

662
01:09:00,394 --> 01:09:01,908
也可能十几岁
But you could also be a teenager,

663
01:09:01,909 --> 01:09:03,378
脸长的嫩  像十几岁的孩子
you know, you have one of those faces.

664
01:09:03,394 --> 01:09:04,278
哦  我的天哪
Oh, my God!

665
01:09:04,298 --> 01:09:05,473
我竟然闻不到你的气味
I can't even smell you,

666
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:08,028
你身上没有腐味  他身上没腐臭味
you do not smell rotten. He does not smell rotten.

667
01:09:09,456 --> 01:09:10,507
太不可思议了
It's amazing!

668
01:09:10,537 --> 01:09:14,281
Nora  他不是来接受采访的  打住吧
Nora, he didn't come here for an interview. Stop.

669
01:09:20,987 --> 01:09:22,818
你为什么到这儿来  R?
Why did you come here, R?

670
01:09:25,405 --> 01:09:27,783
要展示给...  所有人看
To show... everyone.

671
01:09:27,806 --> 01:09:29,459
展示什么?
Show them what?

672
01:09:30,355 --> 01:09:32,020
我们是可以转化的
That we can change.

673
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:35,384
R  这儿没人会相信的
R, no one here is ever gonna buy that.

674
01:09:35,413 --> 01:09:38,104
连把你送他们面前解释的机会都没有
Not that we can get you even close enough to tell them.

675
01:09:38,127 --> 01:09:41,014
他们一见到你  马上就会轰烂你的脑袋
As soon as they saw you, they would blow your head to beds.

676
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:44,172
等一下...
Wait a minute...

677
01:09:44,499 --> 01:09:46,370
你刚才说了"我们"?
Did you say "We"?

678
01:09:46,610 --> 01:09:49,058
我们当中的很多...  都在转化...
Lots of us... changing...

679
01:09:49,815 --> 01:09:51,514
睡着的时候做梦
Dreaming.

680
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:54,602
那可真是非同小可
That's kind of a big deal.

681
01:09:54,627 --> 01:09:56,590
我们得赶紧...  行动
We have to move... fast.

682
01:09:56,617 --> 01:09:58,761
- 什么意思?  - 皮包骨...
- What do you mean? - Boneys...

683
01:09:58,792 --> 01:10:00,569
在到处抓我...
Chasing me...

684
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:02,344
他们在抓我们
They're chasing us.

685
01:10:02,363 --> 01:10:04,173
好了  咱们得去找我爸爸
Okay, we have to go to my Dad.

686
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,805
这主意太烂了
That is a very bad idea.

687
01:10:05,821 --> 01:10:08,106
不  Nora  他以前很通情达理
No, Nora, he was a reasonable guy once.

688
01:10:08,126 --> 01:10:09,636
不不  我觉得你是糊涂了
No, no, I think you're confused.

689
01:10:09,637 --> 01:10:12,117
以前你妈妈才通情达理
It was your mom that was the reasonable one.

690
01:10:12,217 --> 01:10:14,182
而你爸爸呢  足足把你禁足了一年...
That was your Dad, that grounded you for a year...

691
01:10:14,208 --> 01:10:15,274
就因为你偷喝了水蜜桃利口酒
for stealing Peach Schnapps.

692
01:10:15,274 --> 01:10:19,474
你爸大概会这么说  "给我打爆这些僵尸的脑袋"
Assume it's your dad eliciting, "Shoot corpses in the head!"

693
01:10:19,474 --> 01:10:21,797
难道还能有别的办法么  Nora?
What other choice do we have, Nora?

694
01:10:22,702 --> 01:10:24,451
无论如何  我们得把他弄出这城市
Still, we have to get him through the city.

695
01:10:24,452 --> 01:10:25,753
留这儿肯定会被人发现的
Someone will definitely see you.

696
01:10:25,772 --> 01:10:27,737
没有太多时间了
Not much time.

697
01:10:28,389 --> 01:10:30,497
咱们可以帮他伪装
We can fix him up.

698
01:10:30,521 --> 01:10:31,782
什么?
What?

699
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:34,373
我留了些化妆品  想着特殊场合能用上
I have some make-up that I was saving for some special occasion

700
01:10:34,379 --> 01:10:35,899
现在显然不太可能了
that obviously isn't gonna happen.

701
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:40,772
对啊  咱们可以试试
Yeah, we could.

702
01:10:41,084 --> 01:10:44,236
咱们可以先上个粉底...
We can put on a little bit of foundation...

703
01:10:44,854 --> 01:10:46,982
也许再刷点腮红
Maybe a little blush.

704
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:49,649
很可能需要很多腮红
Probably a lot of blush.

705
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:51,114
没门
No way.

706
01:10:52,136 --> 01:10:53,428
可以有
Yeah way.

707
01:11:00,018 --> 01:11:02,362
请你换首歌好么?
Would you change this song, please?

708
01:11:03,459 --> 01:11:05,018
怎么了  很带劲啊
Why? It's funny!

709
01:11:05,893 --> 01:11:07,750
我可不这么想
I think it's not.

710
01:11:59,218 --> 01:12:00,635
等等
Hold up.

711
01:12:01,927 --> 01:12:03,624
你可真帅
You look hot!

712
01:12:57,455 --> 01:12:58,837
怎么了?
What?

713
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:00,486
没什么
Nothing.

714
01:13:00,514 --> 01:13:03,422
不过...  你看上去真不错
It's just... you look nice.

715
01:13:08,329 --> 01:13:10,042
我不知道我爸会怎么做
I don't know how my dad's gonna be.

716
01:13:10,043 --> 01:13:12,771
这方法有点超乎寻常  可能根本行不通
Yeah, it's kind of crazy. This might not work.

717
01:13:12,794 --> 01:13:13,992
是啊
Yeah.

718
01:13:14,730 --> 01:13:17,515
不管如何  咱们在一起
No matter what, we stay together.

719
01:13:19,574 --> 01:13:21,505
我们正改变着一切
We're changing everything.

720
01:13:22,683 --> 01:13:24,436
我知道
I know.

721
01:13:24,826 --> 01:13:27,806
在一起...  答应我好么?
Stay together... promise?

722
01:13:29,016 --> 01:13:30,800
我答应你
I promise.

723
01:13:34,386 --> 01:13:38,116
- 嘿  到上场的时候了  - 好了  咱们去吧
- Hey, it's game time.  - Allright, let's do this.

724
01:13:38,947 --> 01:13:40,559
抱歉
Excuse me.

725
01:13:42,487 --> 01:13:44,889
- 你们几个去哪?  - 去见我爸爸  Kevin
- Where are you guys headed? - To see my Dad, Kevin.

726
01:13:44,905 --> 01:13:47,038
Grigio小姐  我不能让你们进去
Miss Grigio, I can't let you guys in.

727
01:13:47,039 --> 01:13:48,942
现在这附近都高级警戒
We are in high alert around here.

728
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,083
为什么?
Why?

729
01:13:50,098 --> 01:13:51,640
- 发生什么事了?  - 这是机密
- What is going on?  - It's classified.

730
01:13:51,657 --> 01:13:54,903
好啦  我们也有机密事务要汇报  通融一下吧
All right, well, we have our own classified business, so come on!

731
01:13:57,102 --> 01:13:58,050
嘿
Hey.

732
01:13:58,804 --> 01:13:59,964
嘿
Hey.

733
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:02,626
说几句人话  说几句人话  
Say something human, say something human. 

734
01:14:02,626 --> 01:14:03,883
你好么?
How are you?

735
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,405
- 妥了  - 他很好
- Nailed it!  - He's fine.

736
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:29,587
好了  你俩在这儿等着
Okay, you guys wait here.

737
01:14:42,122 --> 01:14:43,836
你来这儿干什么?
What are you doing here?

738
01:14:43,857 --> 01:14:46,104
怎么了?  这都是干什么呢?
What is going on? What is all this?

739
01:14:46,119 --> 01:14:48,600
不确定  反正不太妙
Not sure, but it's not good.

740
01:14:48,612 --> 01:14:50,247
我们得到报告
We've been gathering reports,

741
01:14:50,247 --> 01:14:53,097
为数可观的大批骷髅和僵尸
there are sizable packs of skeletons and corpses

742
01:14:53,097 --> 01:14:54,179
正向我们逼近
coming toward us.

743
01:14:54,192 --> 01:14:56,326
还不知道原因  但要是他们来袭...
We do not know why, but if they're here to attack...

744
01:14:56,340 --> 01:14:59,529
我们就束手无策了  敌众我寡
Nothing we can do about it, too many of them, too few of us...

745
01:14:59,544 --> 01:15:02,708
所以我希望你回家  锁好门
So I want you to get home, lock down the house.

746
01:15:02,732 --> 01:15:05,195
我在你房间放了一把枪
I had a gun there at your room.

747
01:15:05,219 --> 01:15:06,519
是这把么?
This?

748
01:15:06,552 --> 01:15:07,807
行  好了
Yeah, okay.

749
01:15:07,831 --> 01:15:10,202
- 我得和你谈谈  - Julie...
- I need to talk to you. - Julie...

750
01:15:10,234 --> 01:15:11,697
爸爸  这很重要
Dad, it's important.

751
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:15,952
这听上去很荒谬  但是
This is gonna sound pretty crazy, but,

752
01:15:15,971 --> 01:15:20,641
我认为那些僵尸在复活
I think the dead are coming back to life.

753
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:22,548
确实一派胡言
That does sound crazy.

754
01:15:22,575 --> 01:15:24,028
他们正在转变  爸爸
They are changing, Dad.

755
01:15:24,029 --> 01:15:26,935
我也没法解释  总归是自我治愈
I don't know. They're somehow curing themselves.

756
01:15:26,948 --> 01:15:29,319
你觉得他们在自愈?  怎么个自愈法?
Do you think they are curing themselves? How is that?

757
01:15:29,343 --> 01:15:30,494
我看见了
I saw it.

758
01:15:30,515 --> 01:15:32,764
这事真的在发生  
It's really happening! 

759
01:15:32,764 --> 01:15:34,304
Julie  你知道什么正在发生么
You know what is happening, Julie?

760
01:15:34,327 --> 01:15:35,229
正在发生的是
What's happening is

761
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:37,415
他们的数量与日俱增  而我们人数日益减少
everyday there're more of them and less of us.

762
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,490
他们不会自愈
They are not curing themselves!

763
01:15:39,513 --> 01:15:42,905
他们只会吃我们  不会转变为吃素的
We are their food source. They are not becoming vegan.

764
01:15:42,916 --> 01:15:46,436
他们不吃西兰花  只吃人脑
They do not eat broccoli, they eat brains!

765
01:15:46,452 --> 01:15:49,336
你妈还有你男友都没能幸免
Your mother's and your boyfriend's included.

766
01:15:49,367 --> 01:15:52,106
懂了么?  所以你给我清醒点
Okay? So I want you to wake up!

767
01:15:52,125 --> 01:15:53,485
我来解释
I'll explain.

768
01:15:53,501 --> 01:15:54,622
行么?
Okay?

769
01:15:54,646 --> 01:15:56,665
你向我解释  我来帮你转达
Explain yourself to me so I can speak your word.

770
01:15:56,691 --> 01:15:57,994
我能搞定
I got this.

771
01:15:58,020 --> 01:15:59,358
赶紧回家去
Get yourself home,

772
01:15:59,390 --> 01:16:01,542
找个隐蔽之处藏起来
barricade yourself in the shelter.

773
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:03,585
这儿已经够乱的了  你得...
There's enough stuff there that you can...

774
01:16:08,031 --> 01:16:09,332
嗨
Hi.

775
01:16:11,914 --> 01:16:13,418
你是谁?
Who are you?

776
01:16:13,687 --> 01:16:15,401
他是R
This is R.

777
01:16:16,918 --> 01:16:19,471
没问你  我在问他
I didn't ask you, I asked him.

778
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,365
你是谁?
Who are you?

779
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:25,332
我是...
I am...

780
01:16:28,643 --> 01:16:30,280
你是僵尸?
You're a corpse?

781
01:16:30,519 --> 01:16:32,983
他救过我的命
He saved my life.

782
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:35,911
他保护了我
He took care of me.

783
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:38,976
我触动了他的什么地方  然后...
I triggered something in him and...

784
01:16:38,994 --> 01:16:41,787
引发了他们所有人的变化
that must have sparked something in all of them.

785
01:16:41,815 --> 01:16:44,615
现在是他让我一触即发了
Now he's triggered something in me!

786
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:46,763
爸爸  不要  爸爸
Dad, no! Dad!

787
01:16:47,434 --> 01:16:48,820
我们只想帮忙
We wanna help. 

788
01:16:48,846 --> 01:16:52,389
求你了  他们想帮忙  不会攻击我们
Please, they don't wanna attack us. They wanna help.

789
01:16:52,410 --> 01:16:54,234
我们正逐渐好起来
We're getting better.

790
01:16:54,266 --> 01:16:56,754
形势不可能越来越好  只可能每况愈下
Things don't get better, things get worse.

791
01:16:56,773 --> 01:16:59,175
谁要是被咬到  谁就会被感染
People get bit, then they get infected,

792
01:16:59,192 --> 01:17:01,187
- 然后被我一枪爆头  - 不  爸爸
- Then I shoot them in the head.  - No, Dad.

793
01:17:01,207 --> 01:17:03,117
这事曾在你妈妈身上应验
That's what happened to your mother,

794
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:05,028
现在也会由他印证
and that's what gonna happen to him.

795
01:17:05,054 --> 01:17:08,131
真是非常抱歉  Griggio先生
I'm really sorry, Mr. Griggio.

796
01:17:10,222 --> 01:17:14,215
快走  离开这里  无论如何都要平安  好吗
Go... get out of here and be safe, no matter what, okay?

797
01:17:14,848 --> 01:17:17,390
- Julie...  - 我得走了
- Julie...  - I have to go.

798
01:17:21,538 --> 01:17:23,608
你不会对我开枪的
You ain't gonna shoot me.

799
01:17:23,626 --> 01:17:27,113
不  不  我会的  绝对会
Yes. Yeah, I will. Totally.

800
01:17:37,671 --> 01:17:38,753
好吧
Okay.

801
01:17:38,777 --> 01:17:40,682
事情本可以进展更好的
That could have gone better.

802
01:17:41,998 --> 01:17:43,572
我得去警告我的朋友们
I need to warn my friends.

803
01:17:44,242 --> 01:17:46,346
- 去哪儿  - 体育场
- Where? - The stadium.

804
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:50,537
靠
Shit.

805
01:17:51,329 --> 01:17:53,137
快去地铁
Go to the subway.

806
01:18:31,924 --> 01:18:33,709
哇
Wow!

807
01:18:46,151 --> 01:18:48,210
抱歉借过一下
Please excuse me.

808
01:18:48,343 --> 01:18:51,882
借过  抱歉
Excuse me. Sorry.

809
01:18:53,764 --> 01:18:57,775
欢迎  来了  终于来了
Please welcome, come. Coming through.

810
01:19:02,344 --> 01:19:03,730
嗨
Hi.

811
01:19:07,374 --> 01:19:09,448
Julie?


812
01:19:09,986 --> 01:19:11,849
我们准备好...
We're ready for...

813
01:19:12,819 --> 01:19:15,502
- 去打仗了  - 是啊  看得出来
- a fight.  - Yeah, I can see that.

814
01:19:15,538 --> 01:19:17,721
人类士兵正在赶来
The soldiers are coming,

815
01:19:17,752 --> 01:19:20,498
皮包骨兵步步紧逼
Boneys are closing in.

816
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:33,577
他们已经来了
They're here now.

817
01:19:35,785 --> 01:19:38,086
- 挡住他们  - 我们会的
- Keep them out.  - We will.

818
01:19:41,081 --> 01:19:43,022
快跑
Run.

819
01:20:21,159 --> 01:20:24,215
- 大家散开  右侧一队  左侧一队  - 是的长官
- Spread here, right side and to your left.  - Aye, sir.

820
01:20:24,255 --> 01:20:26,328
- 不许射伤女孩  - 我们不会的
- Do not shoot the girl! - We will not.

821
01:20:29,839 --> 01:20:31,636
这边  跟上
This way, come on.

822
01:20:34,104 --> 01:20:36,675
长官  您女儿确实跟僵尸在一起
Sir, your daughter is with the corpses,

823
01:20:36,675 --> 01:20:38,178
我找到了其他僵尸
I've got others.

824
01:20:44,287 --> 01:20:45,626
这里安全
It's okay.

825
01:20:45,667 --> 01:20:47,733
待命
Standby.

826
01:22:13,471 --> 01:22:15,057
谢谢
Thank you.

827
01:22:31,003 --> 01:22:32,991
见鬼了  我们该打哪边?
Who the hell that we shoot?

828
01:22:33,025 --> 01:22:35,266
打这个混球
This asshole.

829
01:22:37,564 --> 01:22:39,114
嗨
Hi.

830
01:22:44,295 --> 01:22:46,376

收到  我们这边也看到了
Copy that, we are seeing that over here too.

834

抱歉  你能重复一遍吗?
Sorry, can you repeat that?

835
01:22:59,961 --> 01:23:03,343
收到  我们发现僵尸正在打骷髅  长官

836
01:23:06,649 --> 01:23:08,539
靠
Shit!

837
01:23:28,326 --> 01:23:29,436
这下完了
It's over.

838
01:23:30,970 --> 01:23:32,434
我会保护你的安全
I'll keep you safe.

839
01:23:34,093 --> 01:23:35,292
你没事吧?
You're okay?

840
01:24:07,944 --> 01:24:09,197
R


841
01:24:30,976 --> 01:24:32,254

哇
Wow!

847

R


848
01:25:30,315 --> 01:25:32,216
下一枪就会瞄准脑袋了
Next one's the head.

849
01:25:32,245 --> 01:25:34,975
- 离他远点  Julie  - 不
- Move away from him, Julie. - No!

850
01:25:35,653 --> 01:25:38,061
- Julie  马上让开  - 爸
- Julie, move now!  - Dad.

851
01:25:38,529 --> 01:25:40,369
你必须要听我说
You have to listen to me.

852
01:25:40,466 --> 01:25:42,594
我知道我们失去了所有人
I know we lost everybody.

853
01:25:43,117 --> 01:25:45,066
我知道你失去了妈妈
I know you lost mom.

854
01:25:45,107 --> 01:25:47,726
但是你我  大家都好好站在这儿
But you and me, we're still here.

855
01:25:48,727 --> 01:25:50,793
我们可以改变这一切
We can fix all this.

856
01:25:50,825 --> 01:25:52,657
我们可以重新开始
We can start over.

857
01:25:52,723 --> 01:25:55,046
他们需要我们的帮助
They need our help.

858
01:25:55,791 --> 01:25:58,537
求求你了  爸爸  看看他
Please, Dad, look at him.

859
01:25:58,635 --> 01:26:00,631
他是不同的
He is different.

860
01:26:00,658 --> 01:26:02,255
他...
He is...

861
01:26:02,279 --> 01:26:03,436
天啊.
God.

862
01:26:05,170 --> 01:26:06,572
流血了
Bleeding.

863
01:26:09,011 --> 01:26:11,158
他流血了  爸爸
He is bleeding, Dad.

864
01:26:14,209 --> 01:26:16,452
僵尸不会流血的!
Corpses don't bleed!

865
01:26:17,555 --> 01:26:19,028
哦  天啊!
Oh, God!

866
01:26:20,698 --> 01:26:22,311
你活过来了
You are alive!

867
01:26:22,331 --> 01:26:23,975
他活过来了
He's alive!

868
01:26:25,506 --> 01:26:27,509
R  你活过来了
R, you are alive.

869
01:26:29,831 --> 01:26:31,365
伤口疼吗?
Does it hurt?

870
01:26:32,664 --> 01:26:34,545
疼吗?  是啊
Yes? Yeah!

871
01:26:37,349 --> 01:26:38,743
长官
Sir.

872
01:26:59,154 --> 01:27:01,625
我是Griggio将军
This is General Grigio.

873
01:27:01,645 --> 01:27:03,906
情况有变
Situation has changed.

874
01:27:14,051 --> 01:27:16,203
赶紧带上他一起走
Let's get him sit the hell out of here.

875
01:27:40,571 --> 01:27:42,832
你还在流血吗?
Are you still bleeding?

876
01:27:43,750 --> 01:27:45,356
是的
Yes.

877
01:27:45,399 --> 01:27:47,050
很好
Good.

878
01:27:47,081 --> 01:27:48,921
抱歉
Sorry.

879
01:27:49,660 --> 01:27:52,113
一方面说来  胸口中枪真的很疼
On the one hand, getting shot in the chest hurt,

880
01:27:52,235 --> 01:27:53,604
相当疼  
like a lot. 

881
01:27:53,993 --> 01:27:56,773
另一方面  能流血
But on the other, it feel good to bleed,

882
01:27:56,792 --> 01:27:59,686
能感到疼痛  感受爱  真是太好了
to feel pain, to feel love.

883
01:28:02,507 --> 01:28:05,711
我希望自己可以说  我们也用爱治愈了皮包骨
I wish I could say we cured the boneys with love.

884
01:28:05,721 --> 01:28:08,446
但实际上  我们只能一锅端了他们
But really, we just straight up kill them all.

885
01:28:08,475 --> 01:28:11,291
这些家伙已经没救了  也没人觉得灭了他们有什么不好
These guys kinda messed up and no one felt bad about it.

886
01:28:11,306 --> 01:28:13,723
他们已经变不回来了
They were too far about to change.

887
01:28:14,132 --> 01:28:17,361
说实在的  这次我们和人类合作得很不错
It's actually a really good bonding experience for us and the humans.

888
01:28:17,393 --> 01:28:20,346
两方一旦合起伙来  皮包骨就没有了胜算
Once we joined forces, they didn't stand a chance.

889
01:28:23,588 --> 01:28:26,630
那些没被杀掉的也渐渐枯竭至死
The ones we didn't kill just wasted away.

890
01:28:27,714 --> 01:28:29,545
而我们其他人
And the rest of us,

891
01:28:29,687 --> 01:28:32,363
重新学习怎么生活
Well, we kinda learned how to live again.

892
01:28:34,850 --> 01:28:37,999
有一阵子  我们中的很多人似乎忘却了生活
For a while, it seemed like a lot of us forgot what that meant.

893
01:28:49,398 --> 01:28:52,852
人类开始接纳我们  与我们沟通
The humans began to accept us, connect with us.

894
01:28:52,872 --> 01:28:54,885
教我们生活
Teach us.

895
01:28:54,907 --> 01:28:57,387
这就是治愈的关键
This was the key to the cure.

896
01:29:00,636 --> 01:29:02,780
一开始这有些吓人  但是...
It was scary at first, but...

897
01:29:02,790 --> 01:29:05,603
所有伟大的事物开始时都是有些吓人的
Every great thing starts out a little scary,

898
01:29:05,631 --> 01:29:07,447
不是吗?
doesn't it?

899
01:29:21,626 --> 01:29:23,489
一切就这么开始了
This is how it happened.

900
01:29:26,517 --> 01:29:30,193
世界就是这样... 恢复如初的
This is how the world was... exhumed.

901
01:29:44,937 --> 01:29:46,894
要帮忙吗?
Need some help?

902
01:29:47,658 --> 01:29:49,419
嗯
Yeah.

903
01:29:49,477 --> 01:29:52,426
我有...  僵尸的硬指头
I have... zombie fingers.

904
01:29:53,822 --> 01:29:55,822
谢谢
Thank you.

905
01:29:59,507 --> 01:30:02,503
- 给你  - 哦  没事儿的
- Here.  - Oh, it's okay.

906
01:30:02,519 --> 01:30:05,195
- 我不介意被雨淋湿  - 我坚持这样
- I do not mind the rain.  - Oh, I insist.

907
01:30:06,961 --> 01:30:09,214
我叫...
I am...

908
01:30:11,391 --> 01:30:13,457
叫Marc...  Marcus
Marc...  Marcus.

909
01:30:14,717 --> 01:30:16,322
我叫Emily

910
01:30:20,148 --> 01:30:23,229
你非常...  好看
You are... very pretty.

911
01:30:24,167 --> 01:30:25,780
谢谢  Marcus
Thank you, Marcus.

912
01:30:26,038 --> 01:30:28,198
现在你应该说...
Now you're supposed to say...

913
01:30:28,214 --> 01:30:30,082
我也很好看
I am pretty too.

914
01:30:34,215 --> 01:30:35,523
R


915
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:37,405
什么?
Yeah?

916
01:30:37,428 --> 01:30:39,790
你想起你的名字了吗?
Do you remember your name yet?

917
01:30:39,818 --> 01:30:41,681
没有
No.

918
01:30:42,839 --> 01:30:45,983
你知道吗  你其实可以给自己起一个
Well you know, you could just give yourself one.

919
01:30:46,007 --> 01:30:49,159
选一个  哪个都行
Pick one, whatever you want.

920
01:30:52,161 --> 01:30:55,306
- 我喜欢叫R  - 真的吗?
- I like R.  - Really?

921
01:30:56,946 --> 01:30:59,481
你不想知道你以前叫什么吗?
You don't want to know what it was?

922
01:30:59,514 --> 01:31:01,905
不想找回以前的生活吗?
You don't want your old life back?

923
01:31:01,909 --> 01:31:03,307
不想
No.

924
01:31:04,167 --> 01:31:06,162
我喜欢现在这样
I want this one.

925
01:31:12,771 --> 01:31:15,399
只是R就足够了?
Just R, eh?

926
01:31:15,575 --> 01:31:17,243
就R了
Just R.

927
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,408
我每天都在做什么啊?
What am I doing with my life?
