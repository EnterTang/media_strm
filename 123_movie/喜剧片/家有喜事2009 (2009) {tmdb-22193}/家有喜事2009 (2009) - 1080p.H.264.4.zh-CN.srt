00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,533
Everybody. Last year, I've launched

1
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:52,340
"The Self-Healing Program for
Post Breakup"

2
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,440
More than 120,000 people has joined

3
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,913
In over 40 cities worldwide.

4
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,482
The success rate, is for everyone to see.

5
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,846
But now I think...

6
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:06,816
Treatment after breakup is not the best.

7
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,789
Therefore, I have start a new program,
called...

8
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:12,463
"Self-Healing Program for PRE Breakup"

9
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,394
Today, we have a new brother

10
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,159
Who'll share his experience with us.

11
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,567
Hello, everybody.

12
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,871
My names's Bo Yu.

13
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,642
My breakups has been caused by
my family's rule:

14
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,885
The eldest sister must get married first

15
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,114
Or misfortune will come!

16
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:38,221
No way?

17
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:41,757
That's what I thought at first, but...

18
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,392
Marry me.

19
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,666
Bo!

20
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:49,493
Kuen!

21
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,894
And also...

22
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:52,104
Marry me.

23
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:56,669
Lynn!

24
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,105
Those were the results of not believing!

25
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,171
I don't wanna hurt anyone else and so...

26
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,382
I never try to love again!

27
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:07,146
The only way out,

28
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,287
is to wait for my sister to get married!

29
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:11,349
I deeply sympathize with you.

30
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,788
By the way, who is your sister?

31
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,625
She is awesome.

32
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:23,631
Good morning, Miss Yu.

33
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,000
Hurry...

34
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,034
Good morning, Miss Yu.

35
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:32,005
What morning?

36
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:34,043
I pay you to work,
not greeting whoever comes in.

37
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,975
You're fired! Totally out of line...

38
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,480
The nail polish is still wet,
it's not a beauty parlor here

39
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,548
You deserve it!

40
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:40,677
- Good morning, Miss Yu. - Morning.

41
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,887
- Good morning, Miss Yu. - Morning.

42
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,716
Miss Yu, is this design alright?

43
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,355
- Yes. - Thank you.

44
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,184
Miss Yu,
please double check this document.

45
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,519
It's okay. Release it.

46
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,591
Sis... you've got a meeting with
publishers at 1 p.m.

47
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,420
New book signing at 2:30,

48
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:52,687
tea with advertisers at 4.

49
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,021
And TV reporters have also arrived.

50
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,662
The questions are all about
your new book released today.

51
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:56,501
They're waiting for you to get ready...

52
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,065
on the balcony.

53
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,101
Alright. Repeat it again.

54
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,341
At 1:30... no, at 1 you've got to...

55
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:05,200
God. I've forgotten everything.

56
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,040
Hello, hello. I am today's...

57
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,144
You're the director?

58
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:10,178
Just listen to everything I say.

59
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,917
Hello! I'm the host, Vivian.

60
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,087
Are you the famous writer,
Miss Choo Yu?

61
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:15,983
It's Chu.

62
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:17,018
Chu?

63
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,749
Really? They spell alike...

64
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,518
These are the 7 questions I'll ask you

65
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:23,853
Please read them carefully.

66
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,292
Then answer us concisely.

67
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,157
Don't waste our time.

68
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,992
I have another job right after this.

69
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:33,504
Plus, you are just doing this promote...

70
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,332
your book anyway.

71
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:36,906
- Director. - Yes, yes.

72
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,974
- Shooting in high
definition today? - Sure.

73
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,438
Good. I want a lighter makeup.

74
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,241
She's younger. Do it heavier.

75
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,678
What?

76
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,113
Listen to her. It's hard to get her.

77
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:48,878
Makeup.

78
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:49,919
Yes! What's up, sir?

79
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,647
Give her a HD makeup.

80
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:52,722
What is HD makeup?

81
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:53,651
It means...

82
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,121
Makeup for TV shows, but heavier.

83
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:56,918
Got it. Okay.

84
00:04:58,498 --> 00:04:59,396
Hello everybody!

85
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,227
Welcome to our show.

86
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,868
We've invited the renowned writer,

87
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:06,594
who's also an icon for
all independent women.

88
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:09,137
She's releasing her new bestseller today

89
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,273
It's Not My Fault to Be a Single Woman.

90
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,945
Miss Chu Yu, please!

91
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:17,907
Miss Yu, you have always promoted
"independence".

92
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,812
What do you think of marriage?

93
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,385
I always believe that
people don't have to get married.

94
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:23,919
A single women have no constraints.

95
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,751
Work and travel whenever they want.

96
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,153
It's free.

97
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,964
All your works are about being single.

98
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,897
Doesn't anyone try to pick you up?

99
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,395
Why do I want that?

100
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,536
I can pick up guys, if I find one I like.

101
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:41,604
Everything comes from Earth's gravity,

102
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,503
the gravitation pull of the universe

103
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:46,337
plus the harmony of yin and yang.

104
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,376
Simply put: Fate.

105
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:51,277
See how great your daughter is.

106
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,008
Teaching people not to
get married again.

107
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,988
I'm really worried that
she won't get married!

108
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,653
But she's too successful

109
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,417
That's what happens to
successful woman!

110
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,460
I guess. She did get her degree at 20.

111
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,996
Yeah, and became a writer,
chief editor...

112
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:09,325
at 26.

113
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,833
That's why she's stuck in the middle!

114
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,436
The ones she likes, doesn't like her

115
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:14,901
And she doesn't like the ones that
like her.

116
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,539
Just like that song by Danny Chan...

117
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,365
What song?

118
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,535
"You're choosing your lover,
and so are they."

119
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:21,575
Then it's bad!

120
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,873
What if she just keep working...

121
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,085
Sis!

122
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:27,512
Dad, mom.

123
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:28,782
Dad. You're back.

124
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:29,850
You look much bigger.

125
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,748
And you're looking more handsome.

126
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:32,821
Look at all these muscles.

127
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,183
Hey, look at your face...

128
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,390
Just shut it!

129
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,563
Have you eaten yet?
I'll cook you something.

130
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,391
It's okay,
I'll eat after I finish my work upstairs.

131
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,192
This month's money.

132
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,660
Good girl.

133
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,632
I've seen a pair of
limited edition fly sunglasses.

134
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:47,237
I know you will like them.

135
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,272
Cool!

136
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,366
I gotta work now.

137
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:55,076
By the way, I wanna tell you...

138
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,612
I got my degree at 19!

139
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,850
Next time don't talk so loud behind
someone's back

140
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,557
Sorry... we'll talk again in
chat room tonight.

141
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,953
My name is "Musculator"

142
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,822
Really? Mine is "Pass off the Wind".

143
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,497
I have one too, called "Sexy Maggie".

144
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,258
What? You are "Sexy Maggie"?

145
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:17,127
Yeah!

146
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:34,845
- Let's eat hotpot after work.
- Good idea!

147
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,782
Come on, let's go to Club Chocolate

148
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:38,819
The idea's been banned.
Think up a new one.

149
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,889
Get it done tonight or nobody can leave!

150
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,187
I have a meeting now.
I'll bring back food at 11:30.

151
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:45,022
Anything suggestions?

152
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:46,697
McDonald's again then!

153
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,199
We're not going to have fun tonight.

154
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:51,494
Karaoke dinner anyone?

155
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:53,466
I know one with great hot wings.

156
00:07:58,811 --> 00:07:59,709
We'll suffer,

157
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:01,479
as long as your sister stay single!

158
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:02,874
You better find her a boyfriend soon.

159
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,673
Because it won't be hot wings
we are eating next time!

160
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:05,679
What will we be eating?

161
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:06,613
Hot asses.

162
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:07,615
I like hot asses!

163
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,946
Uncooked!

164
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,184
L ~ O ~ V ~ E ~ LOVE

165
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:19,663
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

166
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,390
Over 100 millions results

167
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,702
"Open your heart".

168
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,874
I'm a lawyer, a doctor,

169
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:34,204
An astronaut, as well as a movie director.

170
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:35,345
Fraud.

171
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,209
Are you lonely?

172
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,610
Let me open your heart.

173
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:45,580
Open it! Your heart!

174
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,258
Psycho!

175
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:52,255
I'm a GCSE student who wants to
try puppy love.

176
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,090
Come on, try me!

177
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,542
What's up with you?

178
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,268
What's with all the singing, you happy?

179
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,538
Yes. I'm really happy!

180
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,908
I'm gonna get married!

181
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:17,680
Huan, I thought you vowed to
stay unmarried?

182
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,817
It's good to be in love.

183
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:22,151
It's stupid to be single!

184
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,056
Stupid?

185
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:27,926
When love finds you, you'll faint

186
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:33,270
Then the whole world...
turns upside down.

187
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:36,975
Wonderful!

188
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:40,410
Turns-upside-down?

189
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,708
This guy should be able to
help your sister.

190
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,707
The love therapist: Dick... Cho?

191
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:44,668
I haven’t been so happy for 10 years,

192
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,605
until this past month.

193
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,440
That's great! But today is the last lesson!

194
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:51,845
So fast?

195
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:55,076
You found me just to
heal your broken heart.

196
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,652
Now you've healed up.

197
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,548
You can now love bravely again!

198
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:00,690
But I...

199
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:01,552
Sheila...

200
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,217
Look at you, you dress like a hag,

201
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,191
don't dress like this!

202
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,758
Come on, let's look over here.

203
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,468
Is there anyone you like?

204
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,874
So you like fat and greasy things.

205
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,979
Warm in winter. Cool in summer.
Not bad.

206
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:23,947
But you must stop acting like a "Mistress".

207
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,542
But I have only ever been a...

208
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:30,278
Mistress, mistress

209
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:35,187
123, 321, 1234567

210
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,989
Sheila, from now on
you're no longer a "mistress"

211
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,926
You're a legendary woman,
that only wins in love.

212
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:44,261
Go and love hard on the count of 3.

213
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,561
1, 2, 3

214
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:52,102
Give him a big smile.

215
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,904
It's not going to work with this smile

216
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:57,775
Bigger!

217
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:04,155
The sun is beaming,
rub some lotion on him.

218
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,448
This big?

219
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,659
It might not be enough for him!

220
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,858
I shall leave now!

221
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:19,671
Hello. Can I sit down?

222
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:20,997
Need some lotion?

223
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,405
Sounds good!

224
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,181
Doctor Cho speaking.

225
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,323
I have heard about your situation.

226
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:48,065
So... how much will it cost?

227
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,292
Generally, 30 to 50 thousand dollars.

228
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:51,761
Quite reasonable.

229
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:54,302
As for your sister,
I'll hang up for less than 200,000!

230
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,768
200,000?!

231
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:04,039
Keep to the side...

232
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,352
Dumbass! Keep to the side!

233
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,530
Excuse me!

234
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,576
1234, the right side. Good.

235
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:38,782
Miss Yu, time's up. See you next time.

236
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,575
Didn't you talk on the phone for
5 minutes?

237
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,846
Yes, I forgot!

238
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:44,651
Come on!

239
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,586
Also, I don't think I've sweated enough.

240
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:49,383
I've heard, there's a session here like...

241
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,459
Love on a Diet...

242
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,062
I can beat a guy up?

243
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,566
Sure you can!

244
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:57,734
Miss Yu...

245
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,331
Come on!

246
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,967
Does it have to be so hard!

247
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,050
I don't want to bargain!

248
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,685
You're so reasonable.

249
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,048
What's the treatment?

250
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,417
It's a business secret!

251
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,727
You are giving off vibes of a loser in love.

252
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,224
Do you need some treatment?

253
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:26,328
No. I've already given up!

254
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:29,227
Don't be silly.
I'll give you the cheapest treatment.

255
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:33,164
I'll relight your fire with love again!

256
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:43,044
To relight your passion for love...

257
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,250
First, you need to find the right place.

258
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:46,983
What is the right place?

259
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,721
Simple, somewhere full of girls!

260
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:57,288
Any target?

261
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,496
Yes!

262
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,696
First, you must show a friendly smile.

263
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,391
Keep eye-contact with her...

264
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,736
And you must speak to her within
7 seconds.

265
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,747
If you go right in to chat,

266
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:17,778
it's over if she doesn't react.

267
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,610
Go in from her side.
45 degrees is the best.

268
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:21,853
Attack and defense as you like!

269
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,214
Go.

270
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:25,854
Hi!

271
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,056
Hello.

272
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,336
Pickup line

273
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:40,937
What?

274
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,037
Pickup line

275
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,037
Pickup line?

276
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,039
You've got asthma?
Why are you gasping?

277
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,183
Say something. Anything will do.

278
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,976
Everyday lives!

279
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:01,925
I have constipation lately!

280
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,451
Really?

281
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,894
You can eat more fiber,
or drink more water.

282
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,931
They don't help at all!

283
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,796
Could it be caused by stress at work?

284
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:16,172
Maybe. You know...
I need to get up early...

285
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:19,240
What? Why are you talking with guys?

286
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,140
I lack confidence!

287
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:24,975
123, 321, 1234567

288
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,385
Bo Yu. You're no longer a loser in love.

289
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,453
You're the coolest gentleman in
this minute.

290
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,817
Every step you make is more stylish
than Clark Gable!

291
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:34,957
1, 2, 3

292
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,962
Do you think I'm handsome?
I think I am super handsome.

293
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,570
Which part of me do you think is the best?
Every part.

294
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,400
Why don't you take a look with
the lights out at my place.

295
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:54,275
Excuse me, this is my girlfriend.

296
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,479
I'm handsome.
That's how handsome guys live.

297
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,514
You're so ugly, piss off!

298
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,654
Siu Ming! Siu Keung!

299
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,282
Don't hit my face!

300
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,686
Not the face!

301
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,190
Body only?

302
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:18,131
Sir

303
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,599
Cheque please... leave it to him.

304
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,737
Just a few punch is enough...

305
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:27,874
Come in.

306
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:29,948
Sis...

307
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,606
The interviewees are all here,
take a look.

308
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,614
Why are you wearing a top with
so many pockets?

309
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,014
You really need them?

310
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,321
Don't all photographers dress this way?

311
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,820
Appearance is important,

312
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,220
come back when you get it.

313
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,953
Scram!

314
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,859
Why are all works out of focus?

315
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,724
And the framing is poor!

316
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,559
This is my style!

317
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,494
What style do you have when
you have no techniques?

318
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,105
Scram!

319
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,344
I'm sure you'll be impressed...

320
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,011
with my look and techniques.

321
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:05,182
Yes, but you lack affinity!

322
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,816
The longer I look at you...

323
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:10,420
The more I want to slap you.

324
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:15,124
We are short on employees.
You have 1-month probation!

325
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,959
Sis... he's only interviewing.
He won't work!

326
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,596
What the hell?

327
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,996
Nobody's coming to interviews
these days!

328
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,834
Go go go...

329
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,300
I have him here to make up numbers.

330
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,803
Give me 10 more minutes...

331
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:31,134
see if I can get more from Kowloon.

332
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,576
Hello, I'm here for an interview.

333
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,274
Leave!

334
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,041
Leave, you've got no chance!

335
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,084
You leave!

336
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,910
Who did you work for?

337
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:18,820
I'm a freelancer.
I have worked as a war correspondent.

338
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:21,723
Now, I'm doing some kind of art.

339
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:27,991
By the way, what perfume are you using?

340
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:37,265
This, is my natural fragrance.

341
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,274
The "Wax Factor heart beating perfume...

342
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,177
25th anniversary edition"...

343
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:47,008
Should suit you well!

344
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,413
Psycho!

345
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:56,892
Take a seat.

346
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,361
This job doesn't pay a lot.

347
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:02,693
You gotta raise your family?

348
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:03,799
I'm still single.

349
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:06,197
Plus I got 2 patents 5 years ago which...

350
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:07,768
I can live on.

351
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,837
Which means I can focus on
pursuing my dream!

352
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:12,270
When can you start working?

353
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:13,739
Up to you!

354
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,408
I have a gift for you to
commemorate our first meeting.

355
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,480
It'll break the rules.

356
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,245
Rules are dead. See you tomorrow.

357
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,002
Case number 72645, Chu Yu.

358
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,607
Level of Difficulty: Above 5 stars.

359
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,605
Phase 2 starts right away.

360
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:49,676
The ad needs to be shoot,
you have to make a decision.

361
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:50,438
The outermost one.

362
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,116
The outermost one? Which one?

363
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,614
The outermost tube,
the one that's dimmed.

364
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:55,945
Have to take off my top first.

365
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,884
Miss Yu,
what is the theme color for the ad?

366
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,854
Bronze.

367
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,289
So... who's the model?

368
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:05,520
Get me the tube.

369
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,425
Good looking guy.

370
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,127
That's male model only.
No female model.

371
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:11,832
And the director?

372
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:16,265
Muscles.

373
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,042
Yes, we'll get Jackie Chan!

374
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:23,238
Alright. Get back to the ad!

375
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:06,385
What is it?

376
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:18,798
Miss Yu.

377
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,868
You don't need to come in tomorrow!

378
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,082
Good morning, Miss Yu.

379
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:34,848
What is it?

380
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,487
Nothing... I just wanna ask you if...

381
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:40,851
If I can call you Little Chu?

382
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,423
Of course. I'm actually very easygoing.

383
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,489
Don't worry. In crowded places...

384
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,928
I'll still call you Miss Yu.

385
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,169
Okay... okay.

386
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:53,371
By the way, You...

387
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:55,330
What?

388
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:56,871
Miss Yu has...

389
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:58,167
Redistributed her!

390
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,638
What?

391
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,708
But I don't know English or computer!

392
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:04,347
Wouldn't this decision be... a bit risky?

393
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,948
Let me worry about that,

394
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:07,115
even though you're just a cleaner

395
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,514
But I can totally see that you're a genius.

396
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,052
You just never had a chance!

397
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:13,115
What about the salary?

398
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:14,188
Unchanged, of course!

399
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,792
Will she have her own room?

400
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,188
Yes?

401
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:18,759
The store room!

402
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:20,565
Good! Thank you, Miss Yu.

403
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,824
Okay, start working and work hard.

404
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,967
- Thank you...
- You'll be a manager soon!

405
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,469
Apart from easygoing,
you have great vision too.

406
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:27,535
Yes, quite great!

407
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,230
Really?

408
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:32,032
By the way, what were you asking me?

409
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:33,471
I... I want to ask...

410
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,304
If you're the type who...

411
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,809
sacrifice breakfast for fitness?

412
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:39,143
I love breakfast.

413
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:40,078
- Really? - Sure.

414
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:40,808
Well, that's great.

415
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:43,646
I've prepared a breakfast and
left it on your desk.

416
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:45,447
You'll see it when you get in.

417
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,122
Enjoy it!

418
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:51,828
Really?

419
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:39,467
It's delicious...

420
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,480
It's Not My Fault to Be a Single Woman

421
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,909
Has sold over 500,000 copies in Asia.

422
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,984
Bestseller for 8 weeks.

423
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,653
Miss Yu, that's marvelous!

424
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,485
Chu, the company wants you to
write 6 more books

425
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,217
to make a Single Woman,
the Complete Collection.

426
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:58,956
Okay...

427
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:05,530
Also, the company wants to publish
a traveler magazine.

428
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,500
The first issue focuses on Qiandao Lake.

429
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:11,241
I've been Qiandao Lake before.

430
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,635
Fantastic scenery,
rich in marine products.

431
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,244
You'll be overjoyed if...

432
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:16,536
you like to eat freshwater fish.

433
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:19,306
The steamed fish head is splendid!

434
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:23,519
Branding, marketing, packaging,
account servicing...

435
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:25,587
Do you have any good ideas?

436
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,217
Come on! Spirit!

437
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,292
Why don't we have a tea break first?

438
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:32,794
Great...

439
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:33,857
You bastards!

440
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,327
Fried dumplings

441
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:36,566
It's disgusting.

442
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:39,700
Tried that last time, this...

443
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,164
That...

444
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:48,110
That... guy, speak up.

445
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,111
You say it's beautiful there.

446
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,050
Why don't we have
the environmental ambassador...

447
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,919
Julia Roberts to live there for a year,

448
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:03,093
And invite the world famous director
John Woo

449
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:06,196
To shoot her life in romantic style while

450
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:07,728
Releasing doves into the frame.

451
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:11,062
Free DVD released with the book.
It'll sell itself.

452
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:13,362
So how much... do you expect to use?

453
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,470
Not much. USD 70 million.

454
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:18,039
Julia herself costs 20 million!

455
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:19,709
So what's the price of the book?

456
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:21,672
HKD 8.

457
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,677
Issue 1 should be cheaper,
to get the reputation.

458
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,577
What a good idea!

459
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,949
Do any of you think it's good?

460
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:33,415
Applaud if you do.

461
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:36,759
You guys are right to be silence.

462
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:38,791
I don't know who employed you.

463
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,395
But I don't ever want to see you again.

464
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,930
Okay?

465
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:48,865
I think this idea is possible.

466
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:50,098
You think it's good?

467
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,435
Not practical, but creative!

468
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:55,612
Chu, you're the Ronaldo of our company

469
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:58,543
But your judgment can't be too ridiculous.

470
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,980
But creativity cannot be limited by
our imagination.

471
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:02,311
We can fine tune it!

472
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:03,987
Even if it's limitless,

473
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:05,622
it can't be ridiculous.

474
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:07,792
That... That guy

475
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:10,427
He's just ridiculous,
I'll definitely sack him!

476
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,154
I think you are getting personal and
not business.

477
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:15,390
I'm the boss. I like to get personal!

478
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,362
So what?

479
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,297
Alright! If you fire him...

480
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:20,630
I'll quit! How's that!

481
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,877
Sis... did you argue with the boss?

482
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,383
I have my own reasons!

483
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:37,344
You're the financial centre of our family.

484
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,955
What should we do if you lose your job?

485
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:41,916
We're a family!

486
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,752
Can't we share the burden?

487
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,394
Mom, dad and I can't handle it!

488
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:49,359
Boss!

489
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:53,570
Can you give her one more chance?
It's my fault.

490
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:55,365
If she does it again, I'll beat her up!

491
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,065
What are you on? I never said I'd fire her.

492
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,875
What does she has to do?

493
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:01,673
Boss, I...

494
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,541
Chu, take it easy!

495
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,316
Arguments are good for meetings.

496
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:09,485
Let that... that guy to do some research

497
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,746
Before talking about anything else!

498
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,184
What are you laughing at?

499
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,424
Go get me that...

500
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:17,254
Julia Robert's phone number

501
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:18,156
Okay...

502
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,126
Boss, you must be tired,
let's get a massage together.

503
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:21,456
Go.

504
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:27,796
Thank you for supporting me!

505
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,735
I support all creative ideas!

506
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:33,908
Would it be creative if
I invite you to dinner?

507
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:35,238
When? And Where?

508
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,078
I want that table!

509
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:42,344
That table has already been booked...

510
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:48,416
This is the menu for tonight.

511
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:52,156
Dim the light for me and
get the air-conditioner going.

512
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,824
Yes, okay!

513
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:56,091
There're 2 set meals tonight...

514
00:28:56,434 --> 00:29:00,427
I want a lobster meal.
Lobster and lobster soup.

515
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:03,402
He wants the rib-eye, medium.
And borsch soup.

516
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:06,640
Little Chu,
can you let me order for myself?

517
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:13,275
Miss here wants a... lobster meal.

518
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:14,883
With Lobster...

519
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,019
Little Chu.

520
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,420
Have you not dated for a while?

521
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,995
Who told you? I'll go and fire him!

522
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:27,425
Just guessing!

523
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:30,031
You are the career type,

524
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:32,098
how would you have time?

525
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,066
That's true!

526
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,933
Plus with your talent,

527
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:38,234
no man is a match for you!

528
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:40,877
That's true too!

529
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:44,444
So, what type of men do you like?

530
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,377
Ambitious.

531
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:51,385
Love my mom, dad... and bro.

532
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:53,248
Loyal to me.

533
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:55,790
Handsome.

534
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,825
And humorous!

535
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,997
In the end, it's just someone who's nice.

536
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:02,296
Honestly...

537
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,039
Thank you, sir!

538
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,217
Thank you, madam!

539
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,134
What did you wanna say? Honestly...

540
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,037
Honestly,

541
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:47,835
if you can control your temper...

542
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:49,101
You're quite cute!

543
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,746
I'm cute?

544
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:52,950
Really, I'm cute?!

545
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:55,743
I want ice-cream! Ice-cream!

546
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,412
Ma'am, you haven't had main course yet.

547
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:00,223
I don't care! I'm just a girl who
wants ice-cream!

548
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:01,753
Okay. Sure!

549
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,925
I'm a teenage girl!

550
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:18,873
I'm so happy tonight.

551
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:20,442
I can tell.

552
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:23,044
No, I mean, I'm happy, too!

553
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,625
Okay, bye.

554
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:43,830
Bye.

555
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:45,458
Umbrella for you.

556
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:49,269
Bye!

557
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:51,106
Bye!

558
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:57,307
L-am-so-happy!

559
00:31:57,548 --> 00:32:00,312
L-am-so-happy!

560
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:02,815
I'm really really happy...

561
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:45,856
Shit!

562
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:47,687
This time at Qiandao Lake,

563
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:50,299
Remember to take photos of
all the islands,

564
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:51,866
Don't bother coming back without them!

565
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:52,797
What?

566
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:54,732
And, a girl called Bucktooth Jane...

567
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:56,539
will pick you up.

568
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,575
Bucktooth Jane? Is she pretty?

569
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,075
Of course she's gorgeous!

570
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:04,144
Stop asking questions, just go.

571
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:08,316
Come with me.

572
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:12,449
The boss ordered me to finish
the Single Woman series.

573
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,850
I can't go with you.

574
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:17,255
Take care and don't miss me.

575
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:19,654
I'll try my best!

576
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,501
Brought enough clothes?

577
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:27,669
What you doing? Go... back to work...

578
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:31,102
If you don't have enough,
buy some up there.

579
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,305
Remember

580
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:33,910
Okay...

581
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:39,572
Hi!

582
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,311
I think... I'd better go with you.

583
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:44,451
It's okay!

584
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:45,780
You... go and write.

585
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,220
How about at home,
I know you'll get inspirations there!

586
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:50,257
I'll get another one. Okay.

587
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:51,962
Hey, no...

588
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:56,799
Where're you driving me to?
Who're you?

589
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:59,232
You again, Mr. Chan?
Haven't seen you in ten years.

590
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,695
Qiandao Lake Hangzhou

591
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:08,670
Don't stare at me.
Sis told me to look after you.

592
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:09,813
Just look at you, how old are you...

593
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:11,945
Heavily armed just like Rambo.

594
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:14,151
A total mess!

595
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:16,117
- What are you doing?
- It's time.

596
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,219
It's Wednesday today.

597
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:22,426
Let's have some "Monk's Sweet Armpit".

598
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:23,855
Armpit?

599
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:26,325
It's Dried jujube cooked with
monk's fruit and pork.

600
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,725
- It's nutritious.
- Right.

601
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:33,301
Hey, Doctor Cho

602
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,869
My sis has never made any soup
for anyone.

603
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,065
What did you do to her?

604
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,311
Honestly... all those who need my help

605
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:44,879
Has been hurt by love and
have no confidence.

606
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:47,017
They've even given up.

607
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,583
I only open their heart, and make them

608
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:52,448
See the bright side of love again!

609
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:56,153
But you have opened her heart without
closing it.

610
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:58,420
Wouldn't she get hurt?

611
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:01,892
Don't you remember "Phase 6" of
the treatment?

612
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,226
She'll heal up once the treatment is over.

613
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:07,632
Then she'll enjoy her love life again.

614
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,468
And I'll be out of her life forever.

615
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:13,107
But obviously you'd have to pay me first.

616
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:14,072
Understand?

617
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:15,473
Right, sure.

618
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:23,042
I thought a Bucktooth Jane would
pick us up?

619
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:26,221
I have no idea.

620
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:29,359
You sister send you to look after me,
go and look!

621
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:31,461
What's with the ordering?!

622
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,391
Bucktooth Jane!

623
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,599
Bucktooth Jane!

624
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,562
Bucktooth Jane!

625
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:53,013
Sorry, I'm late!

626
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:55,048
Are you Mr. Dick Cho?

627
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:57,614
You are Bucktooth Jane?

628
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:01,022
No, I'm not.

629
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:03,693
I'm her friend, Mandy!

630
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,461
So... where's Bucktooth Jane?

631
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,689
She's sick today!

632
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,697
So I'm here to pick you up, is that alright?

633
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:14,098
Alright, Bucktooth becomes a babe...

634
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,866
We are on a very tight schedule.

635
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,974
Gotta hurry up. Let's go!

636
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,777
Is this your luggage?

637
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:32,081
Let... let me get it, okay?

638
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:32,948
No!

639
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,386
It's my job to take care of you, let me.

640
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,988
Okay. Go ahead!

641
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:45,629
She's so cute!

642
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:54,007
Bucktooth Jane!

643
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,705
Bucktooth Jane!

644
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:05,146
Bucktooth Jane!

645
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:08,288
Bucktooth Jane!

646
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:10,050
How can you be so rude?

647
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:12,819
Rude? You do have bucktooth.

648
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:17,734
Bucktooth Jane, where're we going?
My colleague is over there.

649
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:20,366
Where're we going, Bucktooth Jane?

650
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,165
Why are you biting me?

651
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:25,974
This blossom shaped islet...

652
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:28,509
has the best view of the lake.

653
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,943
Many tourists take photos here.

654
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:32,581
This is the Lock Island.

655
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,079
This is the Monkey Island.

656
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:36,046
And this is the Dragon Island

657
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,280
So what... what's that island?

658
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:40,956
Maybe...

659
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:47,630
I know! Is that "No Isle, Dear" (no idea)?

660
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:55,328
Is it not funny?

661
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,775
I know it's a bad joke...

662
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:04,538
But I like to tell them!

663
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:24,893
What's this?

664
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:27,127
I called it "Love's like a Tide"

665
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:29,101
It's famous here.

666
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:30,667
Nothing special!

667
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:32,569
Take a look first.

668
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,247
Miraculous!

669
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:38,813
Take a sip.

670
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:45,621
Tastes good?

671
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,255
Sure!

672
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:53,560
You are such a weird person.

673
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:54,958
Always striking a pose and...

674
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,291
talk like they do in movies.

675
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,468
Really? No way!

676
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:00,661
That must be how you pick up girls.

677
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,099
- No! - Yes!

678
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,364
- Really no! - Definitely!

679
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:04,972
- I said no!
- I said yes!

680
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,141
This is it!

681
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:09,777
I...

682
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,581
I really...

683
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:13,806
had a great time today!

684
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:16,485
It was just work! How can it be great?

685
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:20,056
But I really did have a great time!

686
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,359
It's Jane.

687
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:26,358
She said she can come to work
tomorrow,

688
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:28,462
She'll be here for you tomorrow morning.

689
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:32,202
Can I see you again?

690
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:41,236
Give me a call!

691
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:42,511
Sure!

692
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:45,042
Get an early night in!

693
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:49,779
I better get going, goodbye!

694
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,478
Goodbye!

695
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:19,805
Mainland's phone number has
so many digits!

696
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:23,778
Is this 1... or 7?

697
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,578
We just saw each other,

698
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:29,259
would I scare her if I call her now?

699
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:37,794
Would it be too late to call her now,
and scare her?

700
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,365
Let's get some alcohol first.

701
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:47,642
Come on!

702
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:51,574
That Bucktooth Jane was a fake!

703
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:54,079
What's up?

704
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:01,984
Look at yourself!

705
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,091
What's happened?

706
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:05,488
Your look... tells me you are in
a state of wishful thinking...

707
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,458
Your world is spinning around.

708
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:08,927
What does that mean?

709
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:13,099
You feel sweet...

710
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:15,403
sometimes exited...

711
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,802
and sometimes bored...

712
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,203
You'd feel the phone ring when it didn't...

713
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:24,244
Hey. Say something!

714
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:26,040
Premenstrual stress...

715
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:32,183
You messing with me, bastard!

716
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,185
No!

717
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:38,259
Girls can feel the same things
you are feeling.

718
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:40,930
Come on. Tell your uncle Bo
what has happened?

719
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:44,731
Today, I met a girl called Mandy.

720
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:47,367
When I was with her...

721
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,935
feel like...

722
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:52,802
Every time I saw her smile...

723
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:56,877
When... when I saw her,
I smiled from my heart.

724
00:41:57,114 --> 00:41:57,876
That's it.

725
00:41:58,082 --> 00:41:58,980
So...

726
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:01,707
You've met your true love!

727
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:03,010
True love?

728
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:04,414
True love!

729
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:05,916
You're a love therapist,

730
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,487
how could you not know it?!

731
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,923
I... I have never dated!

732
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:14,359
Never? Are you kidding me?

733
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:16,996
My parents are very strict!

734
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:25,138
I see a set of teeth!

735
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:38,482
I'm so sorry!

736
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:42,147
I was sick yesterday so
I couldn't pick you guys up.

737
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:43,690
- Bucktooth Jane? - Bucktooth Jane?

738
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:45,262
Yes!

739
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:48,158
Who is Dick Cho?

740
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:00,968
She's smiling at you...

741
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:03,941
Her teeth're nearly touching your face,
lucky man!

742
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:06,445
123, 321, 1234567

743
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:07,878
I... I'm not Dick Cho.

744
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,848
This son of a bitch here is Dick Cho.

745
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,384
This son of a bitch is Dick Cho on...

746
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:13,819
the count of 3.

747
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:16,718
1, 2, 3!

748
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,565
Just tell me so if you don't want to go,
stop muttering.

749
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,031
God. Even my hypnotic power has gone.

750
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:29,735
Let's start working.

751
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,066
Don't get close to me!

752
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,975
Camcorder, camera, map...

753
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,707
Flashlight, compass, and water gun,

754
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:40,815
and so on...

755
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:42,315
I forgot to bring mosquito repellent.

756
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:44,248
You're so fussy.

757
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:45,917
Yeah, people praise me for it!

758
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:46,919
Come on!

759
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:49,751
Bee! A bee...

760
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,587
You're scared of bees?

761
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:52,987
Yes!

762
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,956
You're a man. You're scared of bees?

763
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,596
What else can a man be scare of,
if not bees?

764
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:03,603
How can you protect your girlfriend?

765
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:06,599
Can't my girlfriend protect me?

766
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:08,735
You act like a bitch too!

767
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:11,278
People praise me for that too! Alright?

768
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:16,585
Don't!

769
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,149
Stop it...

770
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:27,256
Was it fun?

771
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:29,697
I'm scared...

772
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:34,132
Fantastic!

773
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:34,962
Great.

774
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,366
Bravo!

775
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:38,535
Let me show you.

776
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,912
The Olympic rings! Olympic rings...

777
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:00,589
What're you doing?

778
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:03,890
Pretends to be an ostrich,
to lure them over for photos.

779
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:05,965
You're as dumb as an ostrich!

780
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,865
Their brain is just the size of a thumb

781
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:10,334
How would they know what you're doing?

782
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:13,236
It will be easier with food!
Give me your hand.

783
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:16,872
Go.

784
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:27,214
Why're you laughing?

785
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:30,850
Stop!

786
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:02,089
Don't you hate me,

787
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:03,451
why are you being nice to me?

788
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:04,924
I don't know!

789
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:08,028
I suddenly feel that you're not that bad.

790
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:09,822
Really?

791
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:14,498
By the way, there's a water show at
the square tonight.

792
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:17,230
You can tell Dick Cho to
take Mandy there.

793
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:19,439
It's romantic!

794
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:20,769
Romantic?

795
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:22,376
Many mosquitoes?

796
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:24,443
Never mind,
I'd better buy some mosquito repellent.

797
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:39,119
Why are you holding onto me?
Go and chat with her.

798
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:43,028
I... I'm feeling a bit nervous.

799
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,890
I don't know what to say!

800
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:46,230
That's true.

801
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:48,836
Just look at you,
it's a disaster waiting to happen!

802
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:49,595
Exactly!

803
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:50,330
Don't worry!

804
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:52,474
Let me give you an invincible plan.

805
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:53,403
Great.

806
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,271
Whatever Mandy says

807
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:57,173
Just nod your head and say "great"!

808
00:46:58,048 --> 00:47:00,039
It's beautiful...

809
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:07,046
The water show is awesome.

810
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:07,952
Great!

811
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,455
Have you had dinner yet?

812
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:10,115
Great!

813
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,190
What did you eat?

814
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:12,692
Great!

815
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,127
Are you not feeling well?

816
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:16,289
Gr...

817
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:18,627
Mandy, I'm a little claw without birds.

818
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:22,200
Do you mean you're...
a little bird without claws?

819
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:23,395
This is what I just said!

820
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:25,871
Since I met you, I... I feel like...

821
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,976
I'm a bird with claws coming out!

822
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:31,842
I'm not telling a bad joke. I'm serious!

823
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:34,008
Love, is actually simple.

824
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:37,415
If you really love me, look at me

825
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:40,250
And I can see myself through your eyes.

826
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:41,684
That's easy! Come on, take a look...

827
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:43,688
See if you can see yourself.

828
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:45,520
What's wrong?

829
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:46,718
Nothing... sand got in my eyes.

830
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,363
No problem... come on.

831
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:51,032
Anything? Can you see yourself?

832
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:52,634
There's nothing.

833
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,531
Want me to blow away the sand?

834
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:55,998
Go ahead!

835
00:47:58,075 --> 00:48:00,441
Shouldn't have blown it. It's even worse!

836
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:06,343
Why have you kept your head down
all night?

837
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,744
Great!

838
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:08,940
Have you had dinner yet?

839
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,318
Great!

840
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,452
What did you eat?

841
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:13,546
Great!

842
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:17,951
What's wrong?
Everyone does the same!

843
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,027
What are you doing?

844
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,164
- There's bee! - Bee?

845
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:25,801
Don't be scared. I'll protect you!

846
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:30,968
Are you mad?

847
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:44,647
Are you okay?

848
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:46,187
Are you okay?

849
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:47,914
Just got stung by the bee!

850
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:48,921
Let me see.

851
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:49,592
It's okay...

852
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:50,157
Let me see.

853
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:50,917
It's okay...

854
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:51,717
Let me see!

855
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:53,429
It's okay!

856
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:04,698
You're quite good, stop pretending.

857
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:10,337
Bo!

858
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:14,080
I can't be with you!

859
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:15,945
Why?

860
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,487
What're you doing?

861
00:49:17,754 --> 00:49:18,516
- It hurts! - Don't move...

862
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:19,781
Let me take it out.

863
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:20,854
Don't move...

864
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,115
Softer please!

865
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,893
Why?

866
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:26,552
Why!

867
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:34,331
I don't want to hurt you!

868
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:38,972
Don't go! Don't leave me!

869
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:41,704
I want to be single.

870
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:52,319
I am honored to be single.

871
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:54,280
I am proud to be single.

872
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:26,587
Mr. And Mrs. Yu,
thank you for trusting our company.

873
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,485
Come on, cut to the chase!

874
00:50:28,658 --> 00:50:31,786
Okay, let me introduce you to
our new product.

875
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:32,996
"Every spinster with a house"

876
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,630
protection scheme.

877
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:47,400
Seems like, she is the insured person?

878
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:48,534
Yes, right!

879
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:49,905
Wise choice!

880
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,705
I need to ask
some routine questions first.

881
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:55,111
When was the last time she had a date?

882
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:57,744
2 years?

883
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:00,217
20 years?

884
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:04,554
Can you describe the character of
the insured person?

885
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:06,954
A, refined; B, affectionate;

886
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:09,132
C, amiable; D, evil.

887
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:10,266
Evil!

888
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:11,927
The last question.

889
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:15,071
What is the chance of
the insured person getting married?

890
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:18,832
0 being the lowest; 5 being the highest.

891
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:20,940
Anything lower than a 0?

892
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:25,110
I need to recalculate to see if
she can be insured!

893
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:27,912
But it's okay,
I'll leave her my business card anyway.

894
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:30,083
So we can get to know each other.

895
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:45,899
Call me if you have any questions.

896
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:51,229
That must be your brother.
He's handsome!

897
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,269
Our company have another scheme.

898
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:54,477
"Sister is single,

899
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:56,473
there's no problem-o" scheme.

900
00:51:56,713 --> 00:51:58,544
I don't know if...

901
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:04,711
- You'd be interested?
- Get lost!

902
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,115
I'll leave then.

903
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:08,586
Daughter... Daughter...

904
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:11,418
- We just want what's best for you...
- Exactly.

905
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:13,595
That's why we want that scheme for you.

906
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:14,853
Since no one wants you!

907
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:16,862
Not no one wants you,
it's just you don't want to!

908
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,362
- You don't want to!
- Yes... you don't want to.

909
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:21,263
We're both getting older and
your bro is lazy.

910
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:23,666
You gotta protect yourself!

911
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:25,068
You two are ridiculous!

912
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,401
The last Chinese New Year,
you had some exterminators.

913
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:29,144
They couldn't pronounce spiders and...

914
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:30,446
kept saying spinsters...

915
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:31,840
I said nothing!

916
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:33,241
But we did have lots of spiders.

917
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:36,941
They were going all over the place!

918
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:39,018
And now you want me to buy
some protection scheme.

919
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:41,156
It's called "Every spinster with a house"...

920
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:42,585
Don't buy it...

921
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:43,781
- We give up... - Don't buy it...

922
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:45,517
Who said I'm a spinster?

923
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:47,160
I have a boyfriend!

924
00:52:47,397 --> 00:52:49,388
Great, good girl... you have a boyfriend.
Of course you have...

925
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:50,622
I really have!

926
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:53,199
He's called Dick Cho and
he's handsome!

927
00:52:54,037 --> 00:52:55,231
- Handsome? - Handsome?

928
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:56,461
Bring him home.

929
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:57,469
Yes... let us see him.

930
00:52:57,774 --> 00:53:00,641
He's on a business trip in Qiandao Lake.

931
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:01,942
- Liar! - Liar!

932
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:05,478
You two won't believe me? Alright,
I'll take you to him.

933
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:07,148
A trip for you two at the same time!

934
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:11,078
Why won't they believe me?

935
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:13,387
The mobile you called is switched off

936
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:13,988
Why is his phone off?!

937
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:15,690
Try again later!

938
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:22,192
I'm Miss Yu. Yes!

939
00:53:22,432 --> 00:53:24,195
Get me a ticket to Hangzhou tomorrow.

940
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:26,392
2 for my mom and dad on the day
after tomorrow.

941
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:29,161
Send a car to pick me up
tomorrow morning.

942
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:31,102
Don't be late, dumbass!

943
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:41,911
Dicky, let me pretend to call you from HK

944
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,880
To give you a surprise!

945
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,685
Dicky, answer the phone.

946
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,027
How come a girl is coming out?

947
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:56,593
It's just the cleaner!

948
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,960
Yes, coming.

949
00:53:58,635 --> 00:53:59,294
Dicky...

950
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:00,901
Where're we going to take photos today?

951
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:02,832
Wherever you like.

952
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:07,804
Why're they acting so close?

953
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:08,842
Yeah, why?

954
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:10,343
Let's go.

955
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:43,341
Seen any peacocks? They look beautiful.

956
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:44,747
Yeah.

957
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:47,248
Want some water?

958
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:49,374
Thank you.

959
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:53,955
You have some too.

960
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:09,869
Stay calm...

961
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:12,473
Stay calm and I'll let you go, okay?

962
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:14,677
You've calm down... right.

963
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:16,644
It's bad!

964
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:20,272
What are you doing? Who are you?

965
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:27,413
You can tell I'm a private detective by
the I'm dressed.

966
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:29,558
My name is L.

967
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:35,864
Dick, Cho. Yes, Dick Cho.

968
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:38,226
Call me as soon as you get his info.

969
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:39,958
Why're you tracking Dick Cho?

970
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:41,328
I'm not,

971
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:43,335
I'm tracking the girl next to him!

972
00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:45,865
Come with me.

973
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:50,872
What are you doing?

974
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:54,175
Don't you know how to track?
You'll be discovered like this.

975
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,582
12, 13...

976
00:55:58,788 --> 00:55:59,755
What?

977
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:01,321
I'm counting the footsteps.

978
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:04,049
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22

979
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:08,492
11, 12, 13, 19

980
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:12,065
- 23, no, 26 - 22, no, 26

981
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:13,499
27

982
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:15,294
- What're you doing?
- You messed me up!

983
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:16,665
So did you!

984
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:18,066
Just let me count, okay?

985
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:19,832
You spell trouble!

986
00:56:20,343 --> 00:56:22,334
They are over there, look!

987
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:40,758
They've ran off! What's next?

988
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:42,955
Calm down!

989
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:48,799
You do have some power!

990
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:50,496
1800 dollars per hour, we'll halved that.

991
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:51,638
Alright.

992
00:56:51,808 --> 00:56:53,036
Cash.

993
00:56:56,546 --> 00:56:57,877
Chinese Yuan!

994
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:00,706
You spell trouble!

995
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:13,021
This is the Lock Island,
the place with the most locks...

996
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,355
Okay! Just shush!

997
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:17,691
Camouflage cloth, 200 for one.
100 each.

998
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:19,434
Crazy!

999
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:21,726
Money slave!

1000
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:25,032
This place is renowned for love locks
and marriage stones.

1001
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:28,368
If you write your wish on the love lock.
Let's go that way.

1002
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,169
- Then close your eyes...
- Come forward.

1003
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,347
And walk in a straight line.

1004
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:35,574
And manages to kick the marriage sone...

1005
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,944
Then your wish will come true!

1006
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:41,547
- I've kicked it!
- I've kicked it...

1007
00:57:42,158 --> 00:57:44,023
Looks like they have a chance!

1008
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,652
You calm down...

1009
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:48,056
Our fates are joint together...

1010
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,492
- Let me hang it there. - Alright.

1011
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:51,893
By the way...
why're you tracking Dick Cho?

1012
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:52,999
He's my boyfriend!

1013
00:57:53,236 --> 00:57:54,100
Your boyfriend?

1014
00:57:54,337 --> 00:57:56,635
Isn't he out of your league,
he's so handsome!

1015
00:57:56,873 --> 00:57:57,771
What do you mean?

1016
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:59,635
We're very good together!

1017
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:01,943
That bitch must have seduced him.

1018
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:02,974
Let's go over there.

1019
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,507
Look at her smile, what a slut.

1020
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:06,281
Her look disgusts me!

1021
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:07,983
Why do you talk like that?

1022
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:09,218
I think she's nice.

1023
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:12,388
Pretty and kindhearted!

1024
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:20,857
Why are you so uncivilized?

1025
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:23,190
You'll hurt the kids!

1026
00:58:24,367 --> 00:58:25,834
They're innocent!

1027
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:27,662
Stop it!

1028
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:30,064
Hope all the couples in the world...

1029
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,036
can't be forever...

1030
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:38,975
Be forever...

1031
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,219
Damn, we lost them, what should we do?

1032
00:58:45,421 --> 00:58:47,355
You lost them, I've got my ways

1033
00:58:47,624 --> 00:58:49,285
I'm a pro!

1034
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:51,221
Follow me.

1035
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,662
You can see right into Dick Cho's room.

1036
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:56,095
38,000 dollars per day. We'll share it.

1037
00:58:56,299 --> 00:58:57,425
Fine!

1038
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:02,872
How can you see from this distance?

1039
00:59:03,273 --> 00:59:04,501
Use this.

1040
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:06,732
These are binoculars with...

1041
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:09,204
infrared, anti-shock, auto-focus,

1042
00:59:09,445 --> 00:59:10,673
HD and wide angle.

1043
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:13,782
500 dollars per minute.
5 seconds free trial!

1044
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,917
12345. Time's up!

1045
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:17,780
Still wanna see it?

1046
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:18,386
Of course!

1047
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:20,521
That'll be 800 dollars per minute!

1048
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:36,469
Dicky, it's Little Chu, what are you doing?

1049
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:39,503
Uploading some photos.

1050
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,010
Do you miss me?

1051
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:43,405
What?

1052
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,608
Yeah, of course...

1053
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:47,849
Of course I miss you!

1054
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:49,348
How much?

1055
00:59:49,552 --> 00:59:54,683
Hello? The... the reception is bad... here!

1056
01:00:02,131 --> 01:00:03,189
What're you playing?

1057
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:05,025
"Happy Online"

1058
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:12,772
You better not listen to it.

1059
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:13,772
I have to!

1060
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:14,602
500 dollars.

1061
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:16,335
Okay!

1062
01:00:16,846 --> 01:00:18,905
Who called you?

1063
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:19,944
It's that spinster.

1064
01:00:20,149 --> 01:00:22,379
The most disgusting and
bitchy woman in the company!

1065
01:00:29,058 --> 01:00:31,151
I told you not to listen!

1066
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:33,921
Your boyfriend's info is all here.
Wanna see it?

1067
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,597
Each page will cost you.

1068
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:37,390
However much it'll cost!

1069
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:42,032
This Dick Cho... isn't really
picking you up!

1070
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:44,068
He is just a love therapist.

1071
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:45,900
Who helps people with
their love problems!

1072
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:50,504
I think someone has paid him to
mess with you!

1073
01:00:55,451 --> 01:00:57,976
This here is free!

1074
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:18,704
Since you're paying half the rent.

1075
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:21,705
I'll let you sleep in the bedroom.

1076
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:40,127
Miss Yu.

1077
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:42,321
Miss Yu?

1078
01:01:45,468 --> 01:01:46,730
Ran off?!

1079
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:52,931
Where's your boyfriend?

1080
01:01:53,142 --> 01:01:55,303
I don't know what you mean, madam.

1081
01:01:55,578 --> 01:01:58,638
Stop pretending, it's Dick Cho.

1082
01:01:58,948 --> 01:02:01,178
You are his friend? Do you need him?

1083
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:03,045
Are you two dating?

1084
01:02:03,252 --> 01:02:05,652
Have you ever thought,
he might be lying to you?

1085
01:02:05,855 --> 01:02:07,823
Madam, this is the first time we meet!

1086
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:10,389
Why are you asking
these kinds of questions?

1087
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:13,193
Answer me!

1088
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:20,268
Are you in a bad mood?

1089
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:22,165
No!

1090
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:25,306
Try this "Love's like a Tide"? It's good.

1091
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:28,568
Fine. I'll write a bad review for it.

1092
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:37,743
Why is it so good?

1093
01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:39,215
Feeling any better?

1094
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:40,582
No!

1095
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:45,056
I'm here... to tell you, you...

1096
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:47,588
Never mind, cheque please!

1097
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:49,092
It's on the house.

1098
01:02:49,298 --> 01:02:51,289
Come with your boyfriend next time.

1099
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:53,366
My treat.

1100
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:55,132
Thank you!

1101
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:09,685
Mandy... what...

1102
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:11,443
A woman was looking for you.

1103
01:03:11,687 --> 01:03:12,984
What did she tell you?

1104
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:15,316
Nothing, but she looked furious!

1105
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,252
What happened?

1106
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:19,391
Nothing!

1107
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,096
Really?

1108
01:03:21,697 --> 01:03:24,257
Really! Trust me.

1109
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,064
Thank you.

1110
01:03:32,241 --> 01:03:33,401
Where were you off to?

1111
01:03:33,609 --> 01:03:35,099
To track down my rival!

1112
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:36,311
And?

1113
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:38,139
Don't mention it!

1114
01:03:40,183 --> 01:03:41,650
Shit, mom and dad are on a flight here...

1115
01:03:41,884 --> 01:03:43,078
to see my boyfriend.

1116
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:49,116
No problem. Economy or deluxe?

1117
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:51,460
They have come afar,

1118
01:03:51,861 --> 01:03:52,885
it should be deluxe.

1119
01:03:53,296 --> 01:03:54,126
Great!

1120
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:59,891
Daughter, your boyfriend is so wealthy.

1121
01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:02,468
Picking us up with such a luxury car.

1122
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:04,138
Yes, sure.

1123
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,998
I'm gonna be bankrupt!

1124
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:08,301
- What did you say?
- What did you say?

1125
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:10,139
Nothing... I said...

1126
01:04:10,379 --> 01:04:13,576
It's priceless to see you two happy!

1127
01:04:13,816 --> 01:04:15,044
Happy, of course we are happy.

1128
01:04:22,725 --> 01:04:26,217
Wow! Such a big house!

1129
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:38,505
Welcome!

1130
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:41,801
Wow! So many maids here!

1131
01:04:52,688 --> 01:04:53,814
Wow!

1132
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:56,384
Mom, I don't see anything to "wow" about.

1133
01:04:57,026 --> 01:04:59,961
I "wow" coz I have a stomach ache!

1134
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:01,561
Take my mom to the toilet, please.

1135
01:05:01,797 --> 01:05:02,661
This way, please.

1136
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:04,059
Be careful.

1137
01:05:19,015 --> 01:05:20,607
Good morning, sir.

1138
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:22,545
Good morning.

1139
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:28,414
Daughter... this is that
handsome boyfriend you talked about?

1140
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:30,386
Beauty is in the hand of the beholder!

1141
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:33,821
Nice to meet you, sir!

1142
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:36,657
What're you doing?
You want to bankrupt me?

1143
01:05:36,866 --> 01:05:39,300
We said deluxe,
I'm already doing this cheaply!

1144
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:41,934
The servants are all actors from
Springtime Productions.

1145
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:43,136
50 dollars per day!

1146
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:47,035
Hey, so, how did the two of you meet?

1147
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:50,404
Yeah, how did we meet?

1148
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,841
Yeah! Do you remember?

1149
01:05:53,082 --> 01:05:55,277
That time you lost your wallet,
and you need 500 dollars.

1150
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:57,745
Yeah, that's how we met.

1151
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:58,452
Yeah.

1152
01:05:58,654 --> 01:06:00,519
Now we mention it,
you still owe me that 500 dollars!

1153
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:02,381
Then you should pay her back.

1154
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:03,819
A man should be trustworthy!

1155
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:05,290
Yes... trustworthy!

1156
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:06,153
Right!

1157
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:08,022
500, right?

1158
01:06:08,998 --> 01:06:13,128
I had breakfast on an empty stomach,
I'm hungry again.

1159
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:13,994
No problem, sir.

1160
01:06:14,236 --> 01:06:15,999
I've got the best bird's nest soup upstairs.

1161
01:06:16,205 --> 01:06:16,569
Really?

1162
01:06:16,772 --> 01:06:17,329
Let's eat it upstairs.

1163
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,505
Yes, yes.

1164
01:06:19,675 --> 01:06:21,939
4,000 dollars for 50 grams,
we'll work it out later!

1165
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:26,612
Doctor Cho, sis brought our parents up
to see her boyfriend.

1166
01:06:26,849 --> 01:06:28,282
That's you.

1167
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:30,786
I'll talk with sis after...

1168
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:32,612
I deal with your parents.

1169
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:35,290
But tragically, my move is failing!

1170
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:37,515
If not we could skip to "Phase 6" already!

1171
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,489
Don't tell my sis, I hired you

1172
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:40,627
Because I'll be a dead man!

1173
01:06:40,796 --> 01:06:42,764
Don't worry. I'm a pro.

1174
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:44,599
I won't betray you until necessary!

1175
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:46,896
How can a house be so big?

1176
01:06:47,536 --> 01:06:50,528
Can't find the living room,
after going to the loo.

1177
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,307
How stupid of me!

1178
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:53,334
Where am I...

1179
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:55,236
- Where should I go? - Mom!

1180
01:06:55,478 --> 01:06:56,809
Bo!

1181
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:59,014
I'm glad to find you here!

1182
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:00,682
Mom, this is Dick Cho,

1183
01:07:00,983 --> 01:07:02,245
sister's boyfriend.

1184
01:07:02,618 --> 01:07:04,176
Hello, auntie.

1185
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:05,081
Hello, Mr. Cho.

1186
01:07:05,254 --> 01:07:06,414
Hello...

1187
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:10,887
Mr. Cho, you're really... handsome!

1188
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,889
Auntie, you're also beautiful!

1189
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:15,562
Handsome guy! Handsome guy...

1190
01:07:15,965 --> 01:07:18,593
Auntie, you're so... cute...

1191
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:24,329
Why has mom gone for so long?

1192
01:07:24,573 --> 01:07:26,200
Where is she?

1193
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:29,571
Sis!

1194
01:07:29,812 --> 01:07:30,801
Why're you here?

1195
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:33,072
Mom and dad called to say
they are meeting your boyfriend.

1196
01:07:33,315 --> 01:07:34,179
So I've brought Dick here.

1197
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:35,044
What?

1198
01:07:35,284 --> 01:07:36,046
Where is he?

1199
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:37,650
Outside in the garden with mom.

1200
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,515
Nice palm! Nice palm!

1201
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:41,883
Mom!

1202
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:47,095
Daughter, your boyfriend is...
super handsome!

1203
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:48,557
You're also beautiful.

1204
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:49,924
Come here!

1205
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:52,464
- Come here! - Okay...

1206
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:54,000
Come here!

1207
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:55,561
I have something to tell you...

1208
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:56,396
You don't need to say a thing.

1209
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:57,606
I know everything about you,

1210
01:07:57,873 --> 01:07:59,101
I'll deal with you later!

1211
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:02,142
Also, I know someone hired you to
mess with me.

1212
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:04,642
I will find out who that person is!

1213
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,074
Then what?

1214
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:08,476
Chop him up into confetti!

1215
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:11,242
Why do you look so embarrassed?

1216
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:14,082
Nothing... count on me.

1217
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:16,086
I will find out who that this!

1218
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,617
A man called L is acting as my boyfriend,

1219
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:20,852
he's with dad.

1220
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:23,531
You two keep acting, don't blow this!

1221
01:08:23,732 --> 01:08:26,200
What are you guys
so happy talking about?

1222
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:29,735
Mom, have some tea.

1223
01:08:29,972 --> 01:08:30,734
Where's my husband?

1224
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,032
He's eating upstairs.

1225
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:34,035
I miss him. I want to see him.

1226
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:36,267
It's okay... I'll get him for you.

1227
01:08:36,579 --> 01:08:37,773
- No. Let me look for him.
- Right now...

1228
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:38,742
Sit down, mom.

1229
01:08:39,014 --> 01:08:39,742
Have some tea.

1230
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:45,246
Really?

1231
01:08:46,222 --> 01:08:48,053
Where's my wife?

1232
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:49,721
She's in the garden.

1233
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:52,052
I can't. I miss her. I must see her.

1234
01:08:52,194 --> 01:08:53,525
No problem. I'll get her up here.

1235
01:08:53,762 --> 01:08:54,490
Perfect!

1236
01:08:54,763 --> 01:08:55,252
Perfect!

1237
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:56,861
Excellent.

1238
01:08:57,032 --> 01:08:57,589
Delicious...

1239
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:00,564
- Dad's looking for mom!
- Mom's looking for dad!

1240
01:09:00,769 --> 01:09:01,531
Mom.

1241
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:03,201
Where's my husband?

1242
01:09:03,405 --> 01:09:04,497
Cutting his toenails upstairs!

1243
01:09:05,274 --> 01:09:06,206
Dad.

1244
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:07,170
Where's my wife?

1245
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,376
Having a shower!

1246
01:09:09,612 --> 01:09:11,045
Chu says she's in the garden.

1247
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:13,072
Having a shower in the garden!

1248
01:09:13,282 --> 01:09:14,442
So tempting?

1249
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:16,976
I miss him... I can't take this,
I must see him.

1250
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:19,153
No. There're toenails everywhere.

1251
01:09:19,388 --> 01:09:21,652
Move... I miss her. I must see her.

1252
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:24,086
No. Just sit down and wait for her.

1253
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:26,294
Does your stomach still hurt?
I'll give you a rub.

1254
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:28,394
My mom will want to sleep
as soon as she gets a stomach rub.

1255
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:29,962
There are other people here!

1256
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:31,633
It's okay... We're all family.

1257
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:32,892
- Let me massage your shoulder.
- I'm okay!

1258
01:09:33,402 --> 01:09:35,632
My dad will want to sleep,
as soon as he gets a foot rub.

1259
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:37,328
Great... come on...

1260
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:39,403
It's okay, hey... do I need to take my pants off?

1261
01:09:39,642 --> 01:09:40,836
- Ah... no. - Don't need to then!

1262
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:42,840
The inner sole.

1263
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:54,913
Don't wake him up!

1264
01:09:55,157 --> 01:09:56,351
Don't wake her up!

1265
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:58,683
Lift her back to the hotel.

1266
01:09:58,994 --> 01:10:00,154
Drag him back to the hotel

1267
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:08,427
Dinner time!

1268
01:10:09,672 --> 01:10:11,230
- Dinner time? - Dinner time?

1269
01:10:13,776 --> 01:10:15,175
Dining room this way, please

1270
01:10:16,078 --> 01:10:17,807
Thank you.

1271
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:19,473
What should we do?

1272
01:10:19,682 --> 01:10:21,013
OK...

1273
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:23,912
Dad, mom,
I've brought my friend for dinner!

1274
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:26,519
Dad, mom,
I've brought my friend for dinner!

1275
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:28,212
Alright.

1276
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:29,221
Dad, mom!

1277
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:31,282
- I've brought my friend for dinner!
- Good boy...

1278
01:10:31,527 --> 01:10:34,655
Dad, mom,
I've brought my friend for dinner!

1279
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:38,124
Drink a glass of "Jin Liu Fu",
be together forever.

1280
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:40,996
Everybody, cheers.

1281
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:44,637
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1282
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:48,436
Is this going to work?

1283
01:10:48,644 --> 01:10:51,477
Yes! Dad thinks this guy is
your boyfriend.

1284
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:53,477
Mom thinks Dick is your boyfriend.

1285
01:10:53,716 --> 01:10:56,514
It'll be fine unless the cover gets blown!

1286
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:59,611
So, have you thought about marriage?

1287
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:00,719
Maybe 2 more years.

1288
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:02,948
I wanna keep working while still young!

1289
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:06,059
This young man is dedicated to his work!

1290
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:10,821
How about you?
Have you thought about marriage?

1291
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:11,796
Anytime I want.

1292
01:11:12,034 --> 01:11:14,298
My dad's wealthy. I don't need to work!

1293
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:17,364
This young man has so much personality!

1294
01:11:17,673 --> 01:11:18,196
Yes.

1295
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,340
I told you it'll be fine!

1296
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:23,674
What if they start calling Dick's name?

1297
01:11:23,912 --> 01:11:24,810
That'd be bad!

1298
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,479
Dick.

1299
01:11:28,517 --> 01:11:30,610
Does Little Chu bully you?

1300
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:44,325
Dick. Dad...

1301
01:11:44,533 --> 01:11:46,524
Don't speak while eating,
you taught us that!

1302
01:11:47,002 --> 01:11:49,334
Yes, that's right...

1303
01:11:50,272 --> 01:11:51,637
How about this.

1304
01:11:51,874 --> 01:11:53,637
Whoever talk from now on...

1305
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:55,138
will be fined 500 dollars.

1306
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:56,868
Agreed?

1307
01:11:57,846 --> 01:11:59,404
I do!

1308
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:18,558
Dad, mom,
have and early night in the hotel.

1309
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:20,668
Oh, and Dick...

1310
01:12:20,903 --> 01:12:23,371
Have fun till as late as you like.

1311
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:24,731
Let me help you.

1312
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:26,975
Don't come back too early!

1313
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:29,034
Hey, Dick...

1314
01:12:30,245 --> 01:12:31,803
- Don't come in too early.
- Dad, give me 20 dollars.

1315
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:33,411
And it's okay to do crazy things!

1316
01:12:33,649 --> 01:12:36,413
Mom told us to do crazy things!

1317
01:12:44,426 --> 01:12:45,984
Look...

1318
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:48,424
Dick!

1319
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:50,095
Why is he kissing my daughter?

1320
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:51,560
Why do you call him Dick?

1321
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:53,392
He is Dick. Stop laughing!

1322
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:54,966
He is Dick!

1323
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:56,066
He is Dick!

1324
01:12:56,305 --> 01:12:57,363
He's the real Dick.

1325
01:12:57,606 --> 01:12:59,437
- He's the real Dick.
- He's the real Dick.

1326
01:12:59,675 --> 01:13:01,199
Dad, mom. Listen to me.

1327
01:13:01,443 --> 01:13:02,501
The truth is...

1328
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:04,007
Hey, the truth is...

1329
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:05,678
They are twins.

1330
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:08,482
It's not unusual for sis to get mix up!

1331
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:09,149
What?

1332
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:10,147
Twin brothers!

1333
01:13:12,755 --> 01:13:14,279
You think I'm stupid?

1334
01:13:14,523 --> 01:13:16,991
Daughter, you can't be such a slut.

1335
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:18,989
You have shamed your family name!

1336
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:19,819
Don't go.

1337
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:21,724
Go after the show.

1338
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:22,554
Daughter, you have to be faithful.

1339
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:23,727
Love triangle can easily create

1340
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:25,627
family tragedies!

1341
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:28,928
Falling out every day like soap operas!

1342
01:13:29,171 --> 01:13:30,331
Which soap operas are you
talking about?

1343
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:31,539
They are all the same!

1344
01:13:31,707 --> 01:13:33,231
You two stop right here. Please work.

1345
01:13:33,475 --> 01:13:35,670
123, 321, 1234567

1346
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:38,642
Mr. And Mrs. Yu.
I'm not your daughter's boyfriend.

1347
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:40,678
That "bastard" is her boyfriend.

1348
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:43,350
On the count of 3, that "bastard"

1349
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:45,280
Is your daughter's boyfriend, Dick Cho.

1350
01:13:45,821 --> 01:13:47,652
1, 2, 3

1351
01:13:51,527 --> 01:13:52,516
Dick, Dick...

1352
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:57,760
You... have to... take care of my daughter.

1353
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,331
You... whoever... goodbye!

1354
01:13:59,568 --> 01:13:59,863
Goodbye...

1355
01:14:00,235 --> 01:14:00,633
I sat through the whole dinner...

1356
01:14:00,969 --> 01:14:01,230
without knowing your name!

1357
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:01,926
Oh, Yes...

1358
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:04,605
Dad, mom. Go and get some sleep...

1359
01:14:05,674 --> 01:14:07,574
Let them say goodbye first.

1360
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:08,368
- Goodbye... - Goodbye...

1361
01:14:08,644 --> 01:14:09,167
Goodbye...

1362
01:14:09,411 --> 01:14:10,241
- Goodbye... - Goodbye...

1363
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:13,672
Goodbye...

1364
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:15,212
Freeze!

1365
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,578
I haven't finished with you yet,
who's behind this?

1366
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:18,684
Sis, who cares about that

1367
01:14:18,921 --> 01:14:21,116
Let's just deal with him!

1368
01:14:21,356 --> 01:14:22,254
You bastard!

1369
01:14:22,424 --> 01:14:24,085
The one behind all of this, is him!

1370
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:30,427
Sis... I just want you get happy. I'll call you.

1371
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:34,761
Little Chu. I'm in a difficult situation too...

1372
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:36,467
Wish you fortune... and happiness.

1373
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:37,764
Goodbye...

1374
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:42,473
This is free!

1375
01:14:42,678 --> 01:14:43,804
Get lost!

1376
01:14:44,046 --> 01:14:45,479
Don't leave, sleepover tonight!

1377
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:47,510
Sleepover, what do you want?

1378
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:49,112
Just trying to help.

1379
01:14:49,351 --> 01:14:50,875
Just see how haggard you are looking.

1380
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:53,849
You'll scare your parents if you go back!

1381
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:56,080
Just the two of us... how can I trust you?

1382
01:14:56,525 --> 01:14:57,583
Unless...

1383
01:14:57,793 --> 01:14:58,555
Unless what?

1384
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:12,066
I'll give you the draft.
You think I'm scared?

1385
01:16:13,802 --> 01:16:15,201
I want to be single.

1386
01:16:15,504 --> 01:16:16,903
I am proud to be single.

1387
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:18,767
Miss Yu.

1388
01:16:19,007 --> 01:16:20,304
Master wants you to put on a swimsuit...

1389
01:16:20,609 --> 01:16:22,270
and sunbathe with him.

1390
01:16:25,681 --> 01:16:27,273
Alright!

1391
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:30,882
Sexual harassment!

1392
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:43,861
I said swimsuit, we're not scuba diving

1393
01:16:44,166 --> 01:16:45,224
Can't even see your toes,

1394
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:46,628
do you have to be so conservative?

1395
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:48,199
I don't want you to take advantage!

1396
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:51,095
Your bill. Would 100,000 dollars enough?

1397
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:52,898
Luxury cars, villa, actors, crews...

1398
01:16:53,208 --> 01:16:54,675
Makeup, hair-stylist, costume, catering...

1399
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:56,237
All need money!

1400
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:57,844
That still won't cost 100,000?

1401
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,345
Look how happy our parents were,
it's worth every penny!

1402
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:04,347
OK! I'll go upstairs and
write you a cheque.

1403
01:17:04,586 --> 01:17:06,577
Hey... you want to run off again?

1404
01:17:06,822 --> 01:17:09,484
I'll change into a leopard print T-back.

1405
01:17:09,758 --> 01:17:11,692
Just wait for it!

1406
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:17,192
No way.

1407
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:23,167
Ran off again!

1408
01:17:25,907 --> 01:17:28,808
100,000 dollars. He's crazy!

1409
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:35,673
What? This 8th generation shark suit.

1410
01:17:35,884 --> 01:17:38,478
It's not only pretty but
it can keep the sweat inside.

1411
01:17:39,421 --> 01:17:42,322
If you're interested,
I can sell it to you on the cheap.

1412
01:17:43,759 --> 01:17:45,989
Not fooled? Dumbass!

1413
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:48,224
Shit!

1414
01:17:50,065 --> 01:17:52,533
The Single Woman series finished early.

1415
01:17:52,868 --> 01:17:53,493
Marvelous!

1416
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:54,861
Of course!

1417
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:00,732
You lot are still clapping?

1418
01:18:00,976 --> 01:18:03,410
Wanna get fired? Go to work!

1419
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,512
Doctor Cho?

1420
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:15,746
I've retired!

1421
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:25,823
"I don't want to give up,
but need to remind myself"

1422
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,198
What are you laughing at?

1423
01:18:33,442 --> 01:18:34,409
Is...

1424
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:36,741
Is my singing bad?

1425
01:18:44,419 --> 01:18:46,284
What are you doing in Hong Kong?

1426
01:18:46,855 --> 01:18:49,824
Mandy...
and her family came for business.

1427
01:18:50,058 --> 01:18:51,548
I keep them company.

1428
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,022
So why come and see me?

1429
01:18:53,295 --> 01:18:55,160
I want to see you!

1430
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:57,829
You've seen me!

1431
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:03,837
Your home's beautiful!
Why don't you let me in?

1432
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:05,700
No. I've got guests!

1433
01:19:07,909 --> 01:19:09,240
Go!

1434
01:19:09,478 --> 01:19:11,537
I know you fancy me!

1435
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:13,381
But I don't get why...

1436
01:19:13,615 --> 01:19:15,173
you are treating me like this?

1437
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:18,511
Why are you talking so much? Go!

1438
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:26,527
Someone asked me to tell Dick Cho,

1439
01:19:27,162 --> 01:19:29,653
Mandy has a birthday party tomorrow.

1440
01:19:30,832 --> 01:19:33,232
If you are free, come along too!

1441
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:34,969
We'll see...

1442
01:19:35,804 --> 01:19:37,271
About that!

1443
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:10,938
Don't cry. Let her go!

1444
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:13,937
I'm crying because
I don't want to let her go!

1445
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:15,234
It means you fancy her.

1446
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:17,502
Then you should tell her how you feel!

1447
01:20:17,746 --> 01:20:18,371
Yes.

1448
01:20:18,613 --> 01:20:20,877
I don't want to see her hurt!

1449
01:20:21,149 --> 01:20:22,878
Young people are such chickens...

1450
01:20:23,118 --> 01:20:26,315
Remember, love conquers all!

1451
01:20:26,588 --> 01:20:28,954
Can love really conquer all?

1452
01:20:29,224 --> 01:20:30,714
Maybe?

1453
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:32,789
- That's what TV tells us! - Yeah.

1454
01:20:33,028 --> 01:20:34,620
That means I should go tomorrow?

1455
01:20:34,896 --> 01:20:35,885
Do we need to chip in?

1456
01:20:36,097 --> 01:20:37,155
Don't think so!

1457
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:39,833
- Then you must go! - Yes.

1458
01:20:40,802 --> 01:20:44,397
It's thundering outside.
I'd better sleep with you two!

1459
01:20:44,906 --> 01:20:47,704
Happy Birthday to Mandy,

1460
01:20:48,076 --> 01:20:51,739
Happy Birthday to you.

1461
01:20:55,984 --> 01:20:57,542
Mandy, Happy Birthday!

1462
01:20:59,721 --> 01:21:00,779
Bro...

1463
01:21:01,623 --> 01:21:03,591
I... I don't know what to say to Mandy!

1464
01:21:03,792 --> 01:21:06,784
And there's a lot of people...
it's embarrassing!

1465
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:09,486
There's nothing to be embarrass about
in the world of love!

1466
01:21:09,798 --> 01:21:11,595
Tell the person you love, how you feel.

1467
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:14,324
Tell her how much you love her,
it's that simple!

1468
01:21:15,303 --> 01:21:16,235
Okay!

1469
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:18,299
Go for it!

1470
01:21:21,343 --> 01:21:22,310
You too!

1471
01:21:24,312 --> 01:21:27,281
Mandy...

1472
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:29,679
- Who is it? - So loud!

1473
01:21:32,654 --> 01:21:34,053
Excuse me. Please go back down.

1474
01:21:34,256 --> 01:21:35,553
Excuse me. Please.

1475
01:21:35,757 --> 01:21:37,247
Excuse me!

1476
01:21:37,659 --> 01:21:39,183
You're here?

1477
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:42,393
I wish you happy birthday.

1478
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:44,456
I also wanna tell you...

1479
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:46,900
I miss you so much!

1480
01:21:47,369 --> 01:21:51,100
Mandy, I don't know what love is?

1481
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:54,303
But I know, I'm so happy...

1482
01:21:54,542 --> 01:21:55,941
when you're with me.

1483
01:21:56,411 --> 01:21:59,642
And I feel so sad...
when you're not with me!

1484
01:21:59,981 --> 01:22:01,710
I really miss you so much!

1485
01:22:01,783 --> 01:22:02,579
So much that I wake up two hours early...

1486
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:04,010
just to miss you.

1487
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:05,412
How about that?

1488
01:22:05,654 --> 01:22:07,519
The lines are such clichés!

1489
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:09,519
But they are from the heart!

1490
01:22:09,858 --> 01:22:12,884
Alright. You don't believe me?

1491
01:22:13,395 --> 01:22:16,887
I'll hypnotize myself and show you.

1492
01:22:23,371 --> 01:22:25,896
123, 321, 1234567

1493
01:22:26,141 --> 01:22:28,132
Dick Cho, on the count of 3...

1494
01:22:28,343 --> 01:22:30,368
You're no longer a... love... therapist.

1495
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:32,876
You'll only love Mandy forever.

1496
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:34,604
Never lie to her!

1497
01:22:34,849 --> 01:22:36,976
On the count of 3, the rest of your life...

1498
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:40,346
You, Dick Cho, belongs to Mandy

1499
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:42,522
1, 2...

1500
01:22:43,558 --> 01:22:45,788
I don't want you to hypnotize yourself
to love me!

1501
01:22:46,027 --> 01:22:49,588
Look at me and tell me if you love me?

1502
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:54,897
Mandy, I love you with all my heart!

1503
01:23:31,873 --> 01:23:33,534
What do you...

1504
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:35,433
Want coming here today?

1505
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:37,167
Tell the person I love how I feel,

1506
01:23:37,445 --> 01:23:38,571
that's all!

1507
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:40,007
You've looked at me for half an hour,

1508
01:23:40,382 --> 01:23:41,610
without saying a word!

1509
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:43,317
If you don't speak up, I'll go!

1510
01:23:43,752 --> 01:23:45,185
I...

1511
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:49,582
I want to say...

1512
01:23:50,992 --> 01:23:52,584
Jane! Jane...

1513
01:23:53,128 --> 01:23:54,186
Jane! Jane...

1514
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,895
Jane!

1515
01:23:57,332 --> 01:23:59,300
I miss you so much!

1516
01:23:59,534 --> 01:24:01,661
Why didn't you look for me?

1517
01:24:01,936 --> 01:24:04,530
I scared that you'll get hurt!

1518
01:24:05,673 --> 01:24:06,833
Until my sister gets married,

1519
01:24:07,075 --> 01:24:08,633
bad things will happen to you!

1520
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:10,935
It's dangerous!

1521
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:14,479
So you're not scared now?

1522
01:24:14,983 --> 01:24:17,247
I... I am scared!

1523
01:24:19,754 --> 01:24:21,119
Listen to me!

1524
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:25,982
No matter how difficult the road is,
if you want to...

1525
01:24:26,928 --> 01:24:28,759
We can overcome every obstacle!

1526
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:30,625
Can love really conquer all?

1527
01:24:30,832 --> 01:24:33,699
Yes, love can conquers all!

1528
01:24:42,143 --> 01:24:43,075
Are you okay?

1529
01:24:43,244 --> 01:24:44,541
Fine. How about you?

1530
01:24:44,712 --> 01:24:46,304
I'm fine!

1531
01:24:48,016 --> 01:24:50,576
Love... really can conquer all!

1532
01:24:50,819 --> 01:24:53,549
Love really can conquer all!

1533
01:24:56,524 --> 01:24:58,219
I wonder how Mandy is doing,

1534
01:24:58,460 --> 01:24:59,427
let's go downstairs.

1535
01:25:13,741 --> 01:25:16,676
Jane, no matter what happens,

1536
01:25:16,911 --> 01:25:18,139
I'll stay by your side!

1537
01:25:20,381 --> 01:25:21,848
What's that sound?

1538
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:28,016
Oh shit!

1539
01:25:32,327 --> 01:25:35,387
You two are so smart,
very quick learners.

1540
01:25:35,563 --> 01:25:38,191
Come on... let's bet 100 dollars per game,
that's not too much.

1541
01:25:38,433 --> 01:25:39,058
- Alright... - Alright...

1542
01:25:39,234 --> 01:25:40,531
This is yours.

1543
01:25:42,003 --> 01:25:45,461
You're... here to collect my debt?

1544
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:47,571
He's not here for your debt!

1545
01:25:47,775 --> 01:25:50,107
Dick's here to teach us play
"Fight the Landlord".

1546
01:25:50,345 --> 01:25:52,609
Yes... he's the Landlord in this game.

1547
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:54,304
Okay. Let's start.

1548
01:25:54,549 --> 01:25:57,848
Let's have "The Plane", beat that?

1549
01:25:58,653 --> 01:25:59,620
- No... - No...

1550
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:02,415
Ace full house, beat that?

1551
01:26:02,924 --> 01:26:04,016
- No. - No.

1552
01:26:04,225 --> 01:26:06,887
Three of a kind with 4, beat that?

1553
01:26:07,128 --> 01:26:09,062
If not, then I'll win.

1554
01:26:09,264 --> 01:26:10,128
What?

1555
01:26:10,365 --> 01:26:12,230
- Honey, do you have anything?
- Too bad!

1556
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:13,492
Do you?

1557
01:26:13,935 --> 01:26:15,493
So what is this?

1558
01:26:15,803 --> 01:26:17,828
Isn't this "Bomb"?

1559
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:18,832
Yes!

1560
01:26:19,007 --> 01:26:19,905
Bomb him!

1561
01:26:20,975 --> 01:26:22,465
- I'll bomb him. - You go.

1562
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:25,005
1st bomb!

1563
01:26:25,346 --> 01:26:28,042
If four of a kind is a bomb,
then this is too!

1564
01:26:28,383 --> 01:26:30,749
The 2nd bomb 2nd bomb!

1565
01:26:30,952 --> 01:26:33,284
I also have, the 3rd bomb!

1566
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:34,416
Four of a kind again?

1567
01:26:34,656 --> 01:26:37,784
This is, the 4th bomb... 4th bomb!

1568
01:26:38,126 --> 01:26:40,390
And the 5th!

1569
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:42,124
So... so many bombs?

1570
01:26:42,430 --> 01:26:45,456
This is even better, the 6th bomb!

1571
01:26:46,301 --> 01:26:48,963
You want me to play a single card?

1572
01:26:49,170 --> 01:26:50,068
Great.

1573
01:26:50,738 --> 01:26:51,500
2!

1574
01:26:51,706 --> 01:26:52,934
Does it need to be the highest rank card?

1575
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:56,143
Now you mention it...
Aren't the jokers the highest?

1576
01:26:56,377 --> 01:26:57,537
Yes. They're the highest!

1577
01:26:57,845 --> 01:27:00,746
Then that's it!

1578
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:01,371
We won?

1579
01:27:01,649 --> 01:27:02,138
We win!

1580
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:04,111
We each win 100 dollars!

1581
01:27:04,786 --> 01:27:06,048
100 dollars, we've won 100 dollars...

1582
01:27:06,254 --> 01:27:07,084
That's not it!

1583
01:27:07,288 --> 01:27:09,882
7 bombs mean 12,800 dollars each!

1584
01:27:11,292 --> 01:27:12,281
12,800 dollars?

1585
01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:16,493
12,800 dollars...

1586
01:27:20,702 --> 01:27:22,329
I'm busy. I've got to go!

1587
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:23,229
We'll play next time.

1588
01:27:23,438 --> 01:27:25,303
Great...

1589
01:27:27,408 --> 01:27:28,875
Hey... hey...

1590
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:31,776
This is yours.

1591
01:27:32,013 --> 01:27:33,503
That mahjong box looks familiar.

1592
01:27:33,748 --> 01:27:36,717
It's your dad's. After the bank run...

1593
01:27:36,951 --> 01:27:38,680
Yes. I don't trust the banks anymore.

1594
01:27:38,987 --> 01:27:41,547
So I took out all my money,
and put it in that box

1595
01:27:41,789 --> 01:27:43,381
Then stuffed it under the bed!

1596
01:27:43,658 --> 01:27:45,853
So why did you let him take it away?

1597
01:27:47,295 --> 01:27:48,785
He bought us some stocks.

1598
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:49,525
Yes...

1599
01:27:49,731 --> 01:27:50,220
How much?

1600
01:27:50,531 --> 01:27:51,657
One million. One million.

1601
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:54,060
Bastard, I only owed you 100,000,

1602
01:27:54,369 --> 01:27:55,666
you scammed 1 million!

1603
01:27:56,471 --> 01:27:58,268
Hey! Hey!

1604
01:28:02,677 --> 01:28:04,440
The number you have dialed
does not exist

1605
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:06,178
Does not exist?

1606
01:28:06,981 --> 01:28:08,414
Conman...

1607
01:28:08,650 --> 01:28:10,049
Conman!

1608
01:28:10,318 --> 01:28:14,755
Conman ~ ~ ~

1609
01:28:17,091 --> 01:28:19,924
She has suffered a heavy blow.
Her looks may change.

1610
01:28:20,161 --> 01:28:21,890
Prepare yourself!

1611
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:29,569
Jane! Jane... say something! Jane!

1612
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:30,964
Jane...

1613
01:28:31,539 --> 01:28:34,406
Doctor, is this stocking for reshaping
her face?

1614
01:28:35,109 --> 01:28:35,666
No!

1615
01:28:35,843 --> 01:28:36,969
Sorry. I mixed up!

1616
01:28:37,178 --> 01:28:40,011
This is a bank robber injured during
a robbery!

1617
01:28:40,481 --> 01:28:43,416
The cops said it's evidence and
can't be removed.

1618
01:28:43,651 --> 01:28:45,209
She's next door.

1619
01:28:46,721 --> 01:28:48,689
This is your girlfriend!

1620
01:28:57,765 --> 01:28:59,130
Okay!

1621
01:29:06,941 --> 01:29:08,306
Jane?

1622
01:29:13,147 --> 01:29:15,741
Doctor, how come?

1623
01:29:15,883 --> 01:29:16,975
God's will, maybe!

1624
01:29:17,218 --> 01:29:18,048
Not everything can be explained...

1625
01:29:18,419 --> 01:29:20,284
in this world!

1626
01:29:20,555 --> 01:29:22,716
But why has she got makeup on?

1627
01:29:22,957 --> 01:29:24,857
I was a beautician before
I became a doctor.

1628
01:29:25,093 --> 01:29:27,220
It's just occupational habits!

1629
01:29:27,962 --> 01:29:30,328
But how could she be looking like this?

1630
01:29:30,531 --> 01:29:31,555
You're not satisfied? I can undo it!

1631
01:29:31,766 --> 01:29:32,095
No...

1632
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:33,858
No!

1633
01:29:34,102 --> 01:29:35,899
Okay? I'm leaving!

1634
01:29:36,170 --> 01:29:37,694
Thank you very much, doctor.

1635
01:29:38,773 --> 01:29:39,740
Jane.

1636
01:29:39,974 --> 01:29:41,168
What is it?

1637
01:29:41,576 --> 01:29:43,407
You don't like how I look?

1638
01:29:43,611 --> 01:29:45,977
Jane, I'll always remember...

1639
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:48,009
how beautiful you looked!

1640
01:29:48,416 --> 01:29:51,749
I guess, I'll just have to settle with
this face!

1641
01:29:59,694 --> 01:30:03,152
I have important new,
the company is going down!

1642
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:05,628
And I have made a smart decision...

1643
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:07,265
Jumping ship!

1644
01:30:08,035 --> 01:30:09,696
The new boss will be here soon.

1645
01:30:09,937 --> 01:30:11,097
I'm already fired.

1646
01:30:11,339 --> 01:30:13,330
So, most probably
all of you will be fired too.

1647
01:30:14,742 --> 01:30:15,766
That's all!

1648
01:30:17,044 --> 01:30:19,103
Hope we'll meet again. Bye.

1649
01:30:20,181 --> 01:30:21,478
- What should we do?
- What should we do?

1650
01:30:21,783 --> 01:30:22,272
Calm down, calm down.

1651
01:30:22,517 --> 01:30:23,609
Finished, what should we do>

1652
01:30:26,988 --> 01:30:28,387
It's all yours!

1653
01:30:29,557 --> 01:30:31,320
You scum!

1654
01:30:31,559 --> 01:30:33,754
Why take it out on my family,
I can pay you back!

1655
01:30:34,061 --> 01:30:35,323
Why scammed all my parents money?

1656
01:30:35,530 --> 01:30:36,622
Listen to me first.

1657
01:30:37,698 --> 01:30:39,962
Everybody. I'm boss of "Happy Online",

1658
01:30:40,201 --> 01:30:41,532
and your new boss.

1659
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:43,737
You can call me L.

1660
01:30:43,971 --> 01:30:46,735
Don't worry.
We won't close down for now.

1661
01:30:47,141 --> 01:30:49,200
The company's structure is the same.

1662
01:30:49,444 --> 01:30:52,106
Your salary will increase by 20%.

1663
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:54,540
Bravo!

1664
01:30:54,816 --> 01:30:56,249
Except for her!

1665
01:30:57,018 --> 01:30:59,714
Her Single Woman series...

1666
01:31:00,021 --> 01:31:01,454
from the 2nd to the 7th book

1667
01:31:01,689 --> 01:31:04,590
With a gift, have sold less than
70 copies in Hong Kong.

1668
01:31:04,759 --> 01:31:08,627
I've read them. It's all about hatred,
revenge...

1669
01:31:08,896 --> 01:31:11,296
Pessimistic views of life,
incorrect values of love.

1670
01:31:11,566 --> 01:31:13,397
They are... just... pure... evil!

1671
01:31:13,634 --> 01:31:16,068
What the hell! Putting me down in front of
all these people.

1672
01:31:16,737 --> 01:31:17,931
You want a fight!

1673
01:31:18,272 --> 01:31:19,398
Let me finish.

1674
01:31:20,408 --> 01:31:24,310
But, the special issue on travelling in
Qiandao Lake...

1675
01:31:24,545 --> 01:31:26,012
Is really top notch!

1676
01:31:26,247 --> 01:31:27,771
She uses the most innovative way

1677
01:31:28,316 --> 01:31:29,283
Blending two love stories happen...

1678
01:31:29,517 --> 01:31:31,178
at Qiandao Lake,

1679
01:31:31,419 --> 01:31:35,116
To describe the customs of the place.
Brilliant!

1680
01:31:35,356 --> 01:31:35,845
Therefore,

1681
01:31:36,123 --> 01:31:38,182
I wanna put it into "Happy Online".

1682
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:41,428
I believe this new add-on will sell
very well.

1683
01:31:41,662 --> 01:31:42,560
The happiest news is,

1684
01:31:42,797 --> 01:31:44,321
I've just received a statistic report

1685
01:31:44,398 --> 01:31:48,494
The first issue has an order of
2 million copies.

1686
01:31:48,769 --> 01:31:50,532
The company rises from the dead!

1687
01:31:50,771 --> 01:31:52,102
Miss Yu is great!

1688
01:31:52,273 --> 01:31:53,501
Thank you...

1689
01:31:53,808 --> 01:31:54,740
To be honest, this book...

1690
01:31:54,942 --> 01:31:57,536
Let me finish! What's precious is that...

1691
01:31:57,778 --> 01:31:59,405
She reviewed the cup of...

1692
01:31:59,647 --> 01:32:01,080
"Love's like a Tide"

1693
01:32:01,282 --> 01:32:03,250
Made by her love rival,

1694
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:05,713
and even praised it sincerely.

1695
01:32:05,953 --> 01:32:07,477
Which proves she has conscience!

1696
01:32:07,688 --> 01:32:08,916
That's is why their boss had to come

1697
01:32:09,223 --> 01:32:11,088
and thank you.

1698
01:32:17,031 --> 01:32:19,932
Miss Yu, thank you so much!

1699
01:32:20,434 --> 01:32:21,594
It's okay.

1700
01:32:23,337 --> 01:32:24,065
My daughter.

1701
01:32:24,272 --> 01:32:25,136
Your girlfriend?

1702
01:32:25,373 --> 01:32:26,135
My daughter!

1703
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:28,137
Impossible. She's beautiful!

1704
01:32:28,442 --> 01:32:30,205
Like her dad!

1705
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:38,312
Kid, you dare hypnotize yourself

1706
01:32:38,653 --> 01:32:40,018
To fight for Mandy's heart.

1707
01:32:40,254 --> 01:32:41,619
It shows your love is true.

1708
01:32:42,023 --> 01:32:43,752
I think you know what love is!

1709
01:32:43,991 --> 01:32:46,255
Let water go under the bridge and
be good to Mandy.

1710
01:32:46,527 --> 01:32:47,619
Or you'll get fired!

1711
01:32:48,062 --> 01:32:48,994
Got it!

1712
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:51,662
Yes, you be nice to her!

1713
01:32:51,933 --> 01:32:52,865
Just shut it.

1714
01:32:53,134 --> 01:32:54,601
You're evil and dictatorial.

1715
01:32:54,835 --> 01:32:56,132
A control freak with weird habits...

1716
01:32:56,337 --> 01:32:57,634
Have you said enough?

1717
01:32:57,939 --> 01:32:58,963
I'm not finished!

1718
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:00,602
For all those cons and...

1719
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:02,570
all those I haven't even said...

1720
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:05,640
I like them, for a long time!

1721
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:09,213
Because I'm your real fan!

1722
01:33:11,719 --> 01:33:12,583
What do you wanna do?

1723
01:33:12,753 --> 01:33:14,186
Will you marry me?

1724
01:33:14,689 --> 01:33:15,587
Where's your wife?

1725
01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:17,690
That bitch ran away with another guy!

1726
01:33:18,125 --> 01:33:20,889
So I devoted myself to work,
until I met you.

1727
01:33:21,128 --> 01:33:21,924
Say yes,

1728
01:33:22,163 --> 01:33:24,495
and let me be the happiest man
in the world!

1729
01:33:25,733 --> 01:33:27,394
Hey, why did you scam
my parents' money?

1730
01:33:27,702 --> 01:33:28,964
He didn't scam us!

1731
01:33:29,236 --> 01:33:31,204
The stocks he bought us

1732
01:33:31,472 --> 01:33:32,598
Cost 1 cent and

1733
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:35,832
when it closed its risen to 7.8 dollars!

1734
01:33:36,177 --> 01:33:39,203
We're rich!

1735
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:40,208
Sis...

1736
01:33:40,414 --> 01:33:41,472
Sis, get married,

1737
01:33:41,682 --> 01:33:43,081
let me get on with my life!

1738
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:44,676
Yeah.

1739
01:33:45,052 --> 01:33:46,576
He's hardworking, loves your family...

1740
01:33:46,954 --> 01:33:47,750
Loyal, handsome,

1741
01:33:47,989 --> 01:33:49,456
sexy with smooth skin and wear glasses

1742
01:33:50,358 --> 01:33:51,757
Worth a try!

1743
01:33:52,193 --> 01:33:55,253
Honestly, you two are a perfect match!

1744
01:33:55,429 --> 01:33:56,691
Really?

1745
01:33:57,164 --> 01:33:59,098
Look at him. You can tell...

1746
01:33:59,333 --> 01:34:01,528
He listens to his wife!

1747
01:34:01,769 --> 01:34:05,705
Yeah, same as me!

1748
01:34:07,408 --> 01:34:09,137
The diamond is small!

1749
01:34:10,111 --> 01:34:11,806
I knew that!

1750
01:34:31,365 --> 01:34:33,799
I can compromise!

1751
01:34:34,068 --> 01:34:35,092
What do you mean?

1752
01:34:35,403 --> 01:34:38,304
She means yes!

1753
01:34:46,313 --> 01:34:47,177
Are you okay?

1754
01:34:47,415 --> 01:34:48,814
Weak in the knees!

1755
01:35:22,283 --> 01:35:23,648
We're here to join in the fun.

1756
01:35:23,851 --> 01:35:25,250
Yeah...

1757
01:35:25,486 --> 01:35:26,282
So many guests here today.

1758
01:35:26,487 --> 01:35:28,250
Tom Hanks, and Tom Cruise...

1759
01:35:28,556 --> 01:35:29,523
And Julia Roberts.

1760
01:35:29,690 --> 01:35:30,281
Really?

1761
01:35:30,524 --> 01:35:33,049
Really!
But caught the wrong flight to Russia.

1762
01:35:33,227 --> 01:35:33,989
Damn!

1763
01:35:34,228 --> 01:35:36,389
Doesn't matter. They're here.

1764
01:35:36,697 --> 01:35:38,289
Being a groom again?

1765
01:35:39,033 --> 01:35:41,228
Great. Congratulations!

1766
01:35:41,435 --> 01:35:42,800
Thank you.

1767
01:35:43,204 --> 01:35:45,968
Your bird's nest hairstyle is so cool.

1768
01:35:46,273 --> 01:35:47,797
- Congratulations!
- Thank you, thank you...

1769
01:35:48,042 --> 01:35:49,475
Mr. Yen! Thank you...

1770
01:35:49,777 --> 01:35:50,801
Thank you.

1771
01:35:51,045 --> 01:35:51,477
Congratulations.

1772
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:52,373
Thank you...

1773
01:35:52,613 --> 01:35:53,875
Congratulations...

1774
01:35:54,448 --> 01:35:55,676
Congratulations to you.

1775
01:35:56,050 --> 01:35:57,483
Thank you.

1776
01:35:57,685 --> 01:35:58,447
Congratulations, boss.

1777
01:35:58,919 --> 01:36:00,750
May you have a blessed baby soon.

1778
01:36:01,388 --> 01:36:03,151
Who's that guy? So passionate.

1779
01:36:03,357 --> 01:36:04,324
Isn't he what... Yen?

1780
01:36:04,391 --> 01:36:05,358
Bhutan?

1781
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:07,493
Yeah, why didn't we get marry in Bhutan?

1782
01:36:07,795 --> 01:36:08,693
Isn't Qiandao Lake better!

1783
01:36:08,929 --> 01:36:10,123
Where ever it is, it's news to celebrate!

1784
01:36:10,331 --> 01:36:11,161
Exactly!

1785
01:36:11,398 --> 01:36:12,126
Congratulations.

1786
01:36:12,433 --> 01:36:14,025
Thank you...

1787
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:18,038
Happy together

1788
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:24,241
Good luck forever

1789
01:36:26,347 --> 01:36:31,148
Every day is better

1790
01:36:35,122 --> 01:36:38,649
Happy Chinese New Year!

1791
00:00:00,122 --> 00:00:20,649
