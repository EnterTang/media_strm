1
00:02:17,261 --> 00:02:19,491
I'm an attorney and this
isn't how I argue a case.

2
00:02:19,663 --> 00:02:21,130
You're getting on my nerves!

3
00:02:21,298 --> 00:02:25,098
This building has been here 75 years.
It deserves to remain for the community...

4
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:27,794
...because it represents
the ideals of that time!

5
00:02:27,972 --> 00:02:31,738
The community deserves to have
this as a landmark. It is something to...

6
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:35,777
And we're removing it from
our children's children. You go back here.

7
00:02:35,946 --> 00:02:39,575
This a community theater, and everyone
should benefit from this building!

8
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,278
This is your last warning!
We got a permit to take down this building!

9
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:47,185
I have a permit that allows me
to gather for the purpose...

10
00:02:47,358 --> 00:02:50,259
...of expressing my constitutionally
protected right of free speech!

11
00:02:50,428 --> 00:02:53,920
- You want to get killed, lady?
- Sir, according to city code...

12
00:02:54,098 --> 00:02:57,192
- Forget about your code!
- Section 245: If a landmark's committee...

13
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:03,069
- Forget about the code, lady!
- When a landmark's committee decision...

14
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,334
- Lady, you're in violation here!
- Have you ever read the Constitution?

15
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,842
Take it up, Charlie!
Watch this constitution.

16
00:03:09,013 --> 00:03:11,311
- Do you read?
- Come on, clear the area!

17
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,450
Yeah, you're clear. Go ahead.

18
00:03:18,856 --> 00:03:21,290
Okay, you guys,
this is just a scare tactic.

19
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:23,859
- That's all this is.
- Well, it's sort of working.

20
00:03:24,028 --> 00:03:28,624
Meryl, they do productions from the Y here,
productions with little people!

21
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,032
<i>The Nutcracker</i> and <i>Hair.</i> We have
to lie down in protest. Take out your mats.

22
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:37,896
Here, I've got your protective eye gear,
your sun block and your wet naps.

23
00:03:38,075 --> 00:03:42,136
- Everybody, lie down in protest!
- You better get out of the way.

24
00:03:42,313 --> 00:03:45,077
- We will prevail!
- You will go to jail!

25
00:03:45,249 --> 00:03:47,809
Tom! Lock arms.

26
00:03:47,985 --> 00:03:51,011
- I'm not feeling great about this.
- Have a little faith, please.

27
00:03:51,188 --> 00:03:54,282
Meryl, would you marry me?

28
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,050
Really?

29
00:03:56,727 --> 00:04:00,458
Oh, my God! Yes!

30
00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:03,361
Shut this down, Charlie.

31
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:11,266
- I love you.
- Hey, you guys, they stopped.

32
00:04:11,442 --> 00:04:15,435
You're good luck. There is justice
in the world. We prevailed!

33
00:04:15,613 --> 00:04:17,581
Lunatic!

34
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,778
Crazy lady!

35
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:27,819
- We should call our parents.
- Guys, here are your wet naps.

36
00:04:27,992 --> 00:04:30,017
- Oh, thanks.
- Thanks. We had a good time.

37
00:04:30,194 --> 00:04:31,525
- I'm glad. Bye.
- Bye.

38
00:04:31,695 --> 00:04:33,993
Bye. Thank you.

39
00:04:34,165 --> 00:04:36,497
I'll pay you back
this time, guys. I promise.

40
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:40,535
What are parents for, if not to bail
their daughter and her friends out of jail?

41
00:04:40,704 --> 00:04:43,298
So did they knock it down?

42
00:04:45,609 --> 00:04:49,306
I'm not getting through to people.
Why don't people respond to me?

43
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,138
Honey, Wade Corporation is not people,
it's a heartless profit machine.

44
00:04:53,317 --> 00:04:55,410
And it's getting worse all the time.

45
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,713
They're bidding
on the Surf Avenue lot.

46
00:04:57,888 --> 00:05:00,379
They wanna put up condos
and tear down the center.

47
00:05:00,558 --> 00:05:03,288
Wait, our community center?
My community center?

48
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,826
Come on, honey,
let's discuss it over dinner.

49
00:05:06,063 --> 00:05:09,794
No, Dad, you know what? I'm just tired.
I think I'll just go home.

50
00:05:26,517 --> 00:05:28,212
<i>Hi, honey, it's Ansel.</i>

51
00:05:28,385 --> 00:05:31,047
<i>I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna</i>
<i>make it back for your birthday.</i>

52
00:05:31,222 --> 00:05:35,249
<i>We got a lot of new trainees onboard</i>
<i>and they put the green in Greenpeace.</i>

53
00:05:35,426 --> 00:05:38,156
<i>But I'm saving whales</i>
<i>and thinking of you. Love you.</i>

54
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:41,924
Yeah, hi, Mr. Wong. Lucy Kelson.

55
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,898
Fine. I would like a number 17...

56
00:05:47,071 --> 00:05:50,837
...a number fou... Number five.

57
00:05:51,008 --> 00:05:55,638
No. Number seven? Seven.

58
00:05:55,813 --> 00:06:01,080
Can I get the number four
without the garlic sauce?

59
00:06:01,252 --> 00:06:07,191
Okay, and then maybe
two orders of number 26.

60
00:06:07,358 --> 00:06:08,757
And...

61
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,954
Yes, it's for one.

62
00:06:12,363 --> 00:06:15,526
And that's it.
No! Give me a number eight.

63
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:17,360
Give me two number eights.

64
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:18,523
Okay.

65
00:06:18,702 --> 00:06:19,896
Okay.

66
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,971
Okay. Bye.

67
00:06:44,128 --> 00:06:47,655
When they told me I'd been chosen
the Medical Center's Man of the Year...

68
00:06:47,831 --> 00:06:49,696
...I assumed it had
something to do with...

69
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,461
...the millions we have contributed
to the new pediatric wing.

70
00:06:52,636 --> 00:06:56,732
But as it turns out, I had my appendix
removed earlier this year...

71
00:06:56,907 --> 00:06:59,501
...and under anesthesia,
I apparently proposed marriage...

72
00:06:59,677 --> 00:07:01,269
...to every nurse in the hospital.

73
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:06,547
Including the many attractive male nurses.

74
00:07:08,285 --> 00:07:10,776
Why are pediatrics
so important to Wade?

75
00:07:10,954 --> 00:07:13,184
I think feet are very important,
aren't they?

76
00:07:13,357 --> 00:07:16,224
I'm just teasing. I know there's
more to pediatrics than feet.

77
00:07:16,393 --> 00:07:20,227
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you. Always nice to see you.

78
00:07:20,397 --> 00:07:22,763
- George, congratulations.
- Hey, Terry, how are you?

79
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:24,560
- Still slicing people up?
- Indeed.

80
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,827
Yeah, I bet you are.

81
00:07:26,003 --> 00:07:30,030
Hi, there. Oh, yes, the Emile family.
Lovely. So good.

82
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:33,142
- Hi.
- Nice to see you. Take care.

83
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,370
Melanie Corman.
Hospital administration.

84
00:07:36,547 --> 00:07:39,914
My friend Elaine Cominsky wants
to meet you, but she's shy. Is that okay?

85
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,712
That's fine. I've been too nervous
to meet Elaine myself.

86
00:07:42,886 --> 00:07:46,788
- Good. Don't move. Great tie, by the way.
- Thanks. I was rather nervous about it.

87
00:07:46,957 --> 00:07:47,946
- Hey.
- Hey.

88
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:51,617
- Hey, your brother wants to see you.
- What? Now? Tonight?

89
00:07:51,795 --> 00:07:56,459
Yeah, that's what he said. Although
sometimes it's hard to tell with the accent.

90
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:58,726
This is Elaine.

91
00:07:58,902 --> 00:08:02,099
- Oh, hello.
- Hi. Would you sign my <i>GQ</i>?

92
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,541
Oh, <i>GQ</i>! I see what you mean.

93
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:08,610
Sorry, I thought it was a medical term.
You had me all excited.

94
00:08:09,513 --> 00:08:13,415
- "To Elaine, George Wade."
- Thank you.

95
00:08:13,584 --> 00:08:14,744
Hang on just one second.

96
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:18,012
There's no way I'm running up
to Westchester just because he calls.

97
00:08:18,188 --> 00:08:20,816
It's absurd. He'll just have to wait.

98
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,926
- Right on. Hey, man, forget him.
- Yeah.

99
00:08:24,094 --> 00:08:26,255
- Should I get the car?
- Yes, get the car.

100
00:08:39,743 --> 00:08:42,940
- Good evening, Mr. George.
- Good evening, Rosario.

101
00:08:43,113 --> 00:08:46,640
- Excellent new hairdo.
- Mr. George.

102
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:50,446
No, I'm serious. You look like
a young Imelda Marcos.

103
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,021
- Hello, George.
- Hello, Helen.

104
00:08:54,191 --> 00:08:56,853
Don't you think Rosario
looks particularly lovely tonight?

105
00:08:57,027 --> 00:09:00,724
I hadn't really noticed.
Rosario, the children need baths, please.

106
00:09:00,898 --> 00:09:02,866
Yes, Miss Helen.

107
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:06,495
- So how are the kids, apart from dirty?
- They're fine.

108
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:09,833
- Can I get you anything?
- I'd love some Milk Duds.

109
00:09:10,307 --> 00:09:12,867
We don't have any.
I could send out for one.

110
00:09:13,043 --> 00:09:17,309
Oh, no, don't be ridiculous.
If you're going to send out, get a whole box.

111
00:09:17,581 --> 00:09:20,516
- Howard is in the gym.
- Right.

112
00:09:20,684 --> 00:09:26,919
Forty-five minutes, 6.5 miles an hour,
at an elevation of three.

113
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:32,852
It's incredible how much
more relaxed I feel.

114
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,830
- Helen does an hour a day too.
- Yes, you both seem extremely relaxed.

115
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,696
You can cut the relaxation with a knife.

116
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,202
So why am I here, Howie?

117
00:09:43,707 --> 00:09:47,837
We lost the West Side waterfront deal
because your chief counsel...

118
00:09:48,011 --> 00:09:52,243
...your latest model/attorney...

119
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:55,408
...forgot to file
an Environmental Impact Report.

120
00:09:55,586 --> 00:09:58,282
I will admit that the law
is not Amber's strong point.

121
00:09:58,455 --> 00:10:00,787
- That's why I fired her.
- No, I fired her.

122
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,450
Just as I fired Debbie
from St. Barts' Law School...

123
00:10:04,628 --> 00:10:07,597
...and Stacy from Online Law School.

124
00:10:07,764 --> 00:10:12,258
I want someone from Yale or Columbia
or from the continental United States.

125
00:10:12,736 --> 00:10:16,035
Women of that level of intellectual ability
often find me shallow.

126
00:10:16,206 --> 00:10:18,731
- Then hire a man.
- Don't be absurd.

127
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,900
Because they wouldn't sleep with you?

128
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:24,445
No, because it would make you
and Dad too happy.

129
00:10:24,948 --> 00:10:26,882
Dad has been dead for 10 years.

130
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,349
Well, there is no reason for him
to start enjoying himself now.

131
00:10:31,555 --> 00:10:36,219
You need someone who can write
a brief instead of removing yours.

132
00:10:36,393 --> 00:10:38,657
And she can handle your divorce
while she's at it.

133
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:41,593
You are still getting divorced?

134
00:10:41,765 --> 00:10:48,102
Unless my ex-wife decides to fall in love
with me again, or for the first time, yeah.

135
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,041
No! Why do you always
find that so funny?

136
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,907
- It's very hard to say.
- Hire a real attorney by tomorrow.

137
00:10:59,349 --> 00:11:00,782
Don't!

138
00:11:10,526 --> 00:11:13,393
- Hello, have a good day.
- Thank you, ma'am.

139
00:11:13,563 --> 00:11:15,827
- So you're Russian, you say?
- 100%% .

140
00:11:15,998 --> 00:11:20,162
Hence, blond hair,
blue eyes, cheekbones.

141
00:11:20,336 --> 00:11:24,033
Sorry to have kept you so long, but at least
I feel I know everything about you.

142
00:11:24,207 --> 00:11:28,541
And I you. You know, usually I'm so nervous
at interviews, but that was fun.

143
00:11:28,711 --> 00:11:32,977
Yes. Isn't "fun" fun?
It's been a pleasure, Tiffany.

144
00:11:35,751 --> 00:11:37,719
Mr. Wade? Mr. Wade?

145
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:39,912
Hi, I'm Lucy Kelson. I'm an attorney.

146
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:42,250
Have you ever heard
of Saint-Tropez Law School?

147
00:11:42,425 --> 00:11:44,393
- No.
- Shame.

148
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,687
- Where did you go to law school?
- Harvard.

149
00:11:46,862 --> 00:11:48,557
- Harvard?
- Yes.

150
00:11:48,731 --> 00:11:51,495
Intriguing. Tell me more.
What's your background?

151
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:55,068
I don't see how that's relevant.
I work for the Coalition for the Homeless.

152
00:11:55,238 --> 00:11:57,069
- I'm working at Legal Aid.
- That can't pay much.

153
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,971
Well, I'm not very interested in money.
Now, Mr. Wade...

154
00:12:01,143 --> 00:12:03,475
Wait a minute. You're Kelson.

155
00:12:03,646 --> 00:12:05,705
You lie in front of our wrecking balls.

156
00:12:05,881 --> 00:12:08,076
- You attacked the Zegman brothers...
- I did not.

157
00:12:08,251 --> 00:12:10,685
It's not my fault they walked
under a protest sign.

158
00:12:10,853 --> 00:12:13,117
- You're not here for a job?
- I'm here representing...

159
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:15,985
...the Coney Island Community Center.
It was built in 1922.

160
00:12:16,158 --> 00:12:19,252
It's the heart of Coney Island.
It has adult education, basketball...

161
00:12:19,428 --> 00:12:23,125
...CPR, Lamaze, water ballet,
senior's tae kwon do. It's great.

162
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:25,164
For children, it's a home away from home.

163
00:12:25,334 --> 00:12:27,393
I mean, I practically grew up there.

164
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:30,596
It's lovely, but Trump
has the inside track. Nice to meet you.

165
00:12:30,773 --> 00:12:32,400
No, Mr. Wade, you don't understand.

166
00:12:32,575 --> 00:12:34,270
I live there, as well as my parents.

167
00:12:34,443 --> 00:12:36,411
They know Assemblyman Perez,
who's on the board.

168
00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:41,414
If you can guarantee the preservation
of this center, I can guarantee you the build.

169
00:12:42,885 --> 00:12:44,443
But why us? Why Wade?

170
00:12:44,854 --> 00:12:49,348
Well, I can't get in to see Trump
and the Zegmans have a restraining order.

171
00:12:49,692 --> 00:12:51,057
Mr. W?

172
00:12:52,561 --> 00:12:55,325
You're supposed to be taping
<i>The View</i> in half an hour...

173
00:12:55,498 --> 00:13:00,094
...and <i>Public Policy</i> magazine needs a quote
on the challenges of urban planning. Hey.

174
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:03,466
Right. Yes. Quote, quote, quote, quote...

175
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:07,200
What I love about architecture
is its ability to shape a community.

176
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:11,813
This center has shaped the community!
It turns strangers into neighbors...

177
00:13:11,981 --> 00:13:14,575
Its ability to change
strangers into neighbors.

178
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,548
How the right design for a park
makes people feel secure.

179
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,781
How a school building can be functional
and beautiful so that kids feel...

180
00:13:21,957 --> 00:13:27,020
No, the community center makes children
feel engaged, and it allows them a place...

181
00:13:27,196 --> 00:13:31,189
Functional and beautiful so that kids
feel engaged instead of imprisoned?

182
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:32,834
- Yeah, it sounds good.
- I like that.

183
00:13:33,002 --> 00:13:35,527
But I said a community center,
not a school.

184
00:13:35,705 --> 00:13:39,436
I know, it's all very good.
Jump in. Thanks.

185
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,444
- Nice shirt.
- Thank you.

186
00:13:50,619 --> 00:13:54,055
So do we have a deal?

187
00:13:54,223 --> 00:13:57,989
No. I want something else from you.

188
00:13:58,994 --> 00:14:03,727
No. I am fully aware of your reputation
and there's no way you're getting that. No.

189
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:06,333
- Getting what?
- You know.

190
00:14:06,502 --> 00:14:09,130
The sex. That's not gonna happen.

191
00:14:09,305 --> 00:14:11,398
No, that would be nice.

192
00:14:19,565 --> 00:14:22,295
I promise to save your community center.

193
00:14:22,468 --> 00:14:24,436
On top of which, you can direct
our pro bono efforts.

194
00:14:26,572 --> 00:14:28,267
That's millions at your charitable disposal.

195
00:14:30,576 --> 00:14:33,602
I've spent my entire life
working against people like you.

196
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:37,078
Well, maybe if you work for me,
you'll win occasionally.

197
00:14:37,683 --> 00:14:42,416
I need an answer, I'm afraid, immediately.
Here is my direct number at the Grand Hotel.

198
00:14:42,588 --> 00:14:45,716
- You live at a hotel?
- Well, I own the hotel and I live there.

199
00:14:45,891 --> 00:14:47,552
My life is very much like Monopoly.

200
00:14:47,726 --> 00:14:53,062
And I know you wouldn't care,
but I'll start you at $250,000.

201
00:14:55,668 --> 00:14:58,262
There's also usually
a very nice Christmas bonus.

202
00:14:59,905 --> 00:15:01,634
Thank you.

203
00:16:02,534 --> 00:16:05,230
- I can't believe how much I ate.
- I'm proud of you.

204
00:16:05,404 --> 00:16:07,463
The whole left side of the menu.

205
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,666
You know when I get tense,
I just start to eat.

206
00:16:10,843 --> 00:16:15,473
- Honey, you cannot work for that man.
- Hey, we can use the bail money.

207
00:16:15,648 --> 00:16:17,548
- Remember what Sun Tzu said?
- Yes.

208
00:16:17,716 --> 00:16:21,379
"Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer."

209
00:16:21,553 --> 00:16:23,680
Sun Tzu didn't have a daughter.

210
00:16:24,023 --> 00:16:26,491
What's this? Oh, dessert. Thank you.

211
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:29,526
It's the only way to save
the community center.

212
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,595
It is. And if I work for him...

213
00:16:31,764 --> 00:16:35,530
...I have huge resources
at my disposal for charities and shelters...

214
00:16:35,701 --> 00:16:38,226
- Yes, but...
- Mom, I promise.

215
00:16:38,404 --> 00:16:41,339
I will still be your daughter.
I will still be a lawyer.

216
00:16:41,507 --> 00:16:44,738
And I will still have
all the same ideals.

217
00:16:47,212 --> 00:16:48,611
Let's update all the files.

218
00:16:50,115 --> 00:16:53,744
Especially the muni-codes
because I'll need those.

219
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:56,251
I'm gonna speak with Mr. Wade.

220
00:16:56,422 --> 00:16:57,821
Mr. Wade, so sorry to bother.

221
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,323
I've been over the Environmental
Impact Reports for Island Towers.

222
00:17:01,493 --> 00:17:03,688
- I would really love to talk to you.
- Very good.

223
00:17:03,862 --> 00:17:07,195
I really wanted to ask you:
Which one of these do you prefer?

224
00:17:07,366 --> 00:17:11,700
- How do you mean?
- It's for my new personalized stationery.

225
00:17:12,438 --> 00:17:15,339
Is this a trick question?
They look exactly the same to me.

226
00:17:15,507 --> 00:17:21,104
No, not at all. This is a linen finish
and this is a watermarked vellum finish.

227
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,977
Leaving aside the fact
that they've taken perfectly good forests...

228
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:28,677
...and denuded them in order
to produce this nonrecyclable paper...

229
00:17:28,854 --> 00:17:32,221
...I would say it was...

230
00:17:39,832 --> 00:17:42,892
Well, then this one. It tastes better.

231
00:17:48,841 --> 00:17:51,435
Do you know, I've asked
30 people that question.

232
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:54,443
You're the only one to come up
with that answer.

233
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,338
My God, you're good.
I'm getting you a bigger office.

234
00:17:58,517 --> 00:18:01,611
No, it's very sweet,
but I'd rather go over the...

235
00:18:04,957 --> 00:18:06,948
Very firm.

236
00:18:08,227 --> 00:18:09,660
But is it too firm?

237
00:18:09,828 --> 00:18:14,026
There's some debate among chiropractors
about the optimum level of mattress tension.

238
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:15,325
What are your thoughts?

239
00:18:15,501 --> 00:18:17,560
If you really want to know,
the more firm the mattress...

240
00:18:19,671 --> 00:18:21,571
...the more pressure on the 5th vertebra.

241
00:18:26,378 --> 00:18:28,812
Quite bouncy, though. Have a bounce.

242
00:18:28,981 --> 00:18:30,346
No.

243
00:18:36,655 --> 00:18:38,486
- Hello.
- Yes, I'm glad you're up.

244
00:18:38,657 --> 00:18:41,353
I didn't want to wake you.
I just felt like a chat.

245
00:18:41,526 --> 00:18:44,518
George, it is 2:15 in the morning.

246
00:18:44,696 --> 00:18:47,358
Can't you talk to whatever
Mensa candidate you're with?

247
00:18:47,532 --> 00:18:48,931
I resent the implication...

248
00:18:49,101 --> 00:18:51,797
...that because someone
may not share your high IQ...

249
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,530
...they're not a person
of substance and depth.

250
00:18:54,706 --> 00:18:58,005
- You all right?
- I swallowed my Altoid.

251
00:18:58,677 --> 00:19:02,238
She swallowed her Altoid. That can happen.
A sudden hair flick, very dangerous.

252
00:19:02,414 --> 00:19:05,406
Okay, George, I am tired.
Put her on the phone.

253
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:07,748
You mean, put her on the phone?

254
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,586
Put her on the phone!

255
00:19:10,756 --> 00:19:12,656
All right. Someone for you.

256
00:19:15,794 --> 00:19:18,228
- Hi.
- Hi.

257
00:19:18,397 --> 00:19:21,798
The man you're dancing
with is deeply troubled, okay?

258
00:19:21,967 --> 00:19:24,231
And even though he's rich
and attractive...

259
00:19:24,403 --> 00:19:27,304
...you're too young to trade
yourself like a stock on NASDAQ...

260
00:19:27,472 --> 00:19:29,838
...for someone who won't
remember your name...

261
00:19:30,008 --> 00:19:32,340
...or his in the morning,
is still married...

262
00:19:32,511 --> 00:19:36,413
...and has recently had
a very suspicious rash.

263
00:19:37,716 --> 00:19:39,013
It is 2:16.

264
00:19:39,184 --> 00:19:42,517
Go home, finish high school
and reach your potential!

265
00:19:43,422 --> 00:19:44,912
You all right?

266
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,081
I think I'm gonna go.

267
00:19:48,427 --> 00:19:50,987
- What did you say to her? Nice chat?
- Yes.

268
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:02,096
That we have to talk about.
Now, do you think I should cry?

269
00:20:02,273 --> 00:20:04,002
I was thinking bursts of sobs.

270
00:20:10,081 --> 00:20:11,070
<i>More of a whimper.</i>

271
00:20:11,249 --> 00:20:14,218
You're pathetic. Good night.

272
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,815
All right.

273
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:35,598
I'm sure he'll be here any minute.
Is there any more Diet Coke?

274
00:20:41,479 --> 00:20:42,537
Sorry, everybody.

275
00:20:42,713 --> 00:20:46,342
Did I miss the blessed event?

276
00:20:47,618 --> 00:20:49,518
Check with me before you talk.

277
00:20:49,687 --> 00:20:52,815
Now that we're all here, I'd like to discuss
the settlement terms.

278
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,322
The terms have been set.
It's called a prenup.

279
00:20:55,493 --> 00:20:56,460
We both know...

280
00:20:56,627 --> 00:20:59,653
...that a prenup doesn't preclude
certain recompensatory...

281
00:20:59,831 --> 00:21:03,858
In plain English, although I can follow
you in German and Japanese if you prefer.

282
00:21:04,035 --> 00:21:07,027
- She wants double the alimony.
- No way.

283
00:21:07,772 --> 00:21:10,639
Given the situation,
it's not an unreasonable request.

284
00:21:11,042 --> 00:21:13,704
You're referring to the alleged infidelity,
are you not?

285
00:21:13,878 --> 00:21:16,972
Alleged? He was having
sex with her in our bed.

286
00:21:17,148 --> 00:21:19,708
I knew you were worried
about getting anything on that sofa.

287
00:21:19,884 --> 00:21:23,012
- How dare you come in here...
- I shouldn't have said that. Sorry.

288
00:21:23,187 --> 00:21:24,620
Please.

289
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:29,951
So you are saying that infidelity
is worth twice the alimony.

290
00:21:30,128 --> 00:21:32,460
Using your reasoning,
any infidelity on her part...

291
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:35,428
...would have to be held against her
in a monetary accounting.

292
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,828
What are you suggesting?

293
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:42,064
The soon to be ex-Mrs. Wade did a little
couch time with a company accountant.

294
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,936
And he's willing to testify.

295
00:21:45,977 --> 00:21:48,445
I have Ioyal employees.
I think it's the health plan.

296
00:21:48,613 --> 00:21:51,639
- The health plan is excellent.
- Thank you.

297
00:21:51,816 --> 00:21:54,842
- We will not agree to pay any...
- We will pay the alimony...

298
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:57,749
...plus $100,000 and
a generous property settlement...

299
00:21:57,922 --> 00:22:00,482
...if you release me from further obligation.

300
00:22:00,658 --> 00:22:02,057
- You son of a bitch!
- What?

301
00:22:02,226 --> 00:22:04,854
Watch your language
or you will not get the estate, Mrs. Wade.

302
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:08,396
Don't call me that!
You're just another one of his stupid bimbos!

303
00:22:08,566 --> 00:22:11,000
Now, wait! She is far from stupid...

304
00:22:11,903 --> 00:22:14,701
- What do you think you're doing?
- Went up my nose.

305
00:22:14,872 --> 00:22:17,033
- Water went up my nose.
- It's only water.

306
00:22:17,675 --> 00:22:21,042
Okay, this hankie is very nearly clean.
I'm going to dab you.

307
00:22:21,212 --> 00:22:22,236
- You may blow.
- Thank you.

308
00:22:22,413 --> 00:22:23,402
Good.

309
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,918
Divorce always gives me
an appetite. Kebab?

310
00:22:29,086 --> 00:22:32,078
No, I've never warmed
to the idea of a flesh Popsicle.

311
00:22:32,256 --> 00:22:35,817
- One, please. Chicken, thank you.
- Why did you give her the money?

312
00:22:35,993 --> 00:22:38,894
She'd never have stopped
till she got what she wanted.

313
00:22:39,063 --> 00:22:42,123
You always say I have a responsibility
towards those less fortunate.

314
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,564
Everybody is less fortunate than you...

315
00:22:44,735 --> 00:22:48,432
...so just give the money to someone
who's not gonna spend it on collagen.

316
00:22:48,606 --> 00:22:51,302
You only want me to be generous
to those you approve of.

317
00:22:51,475 --> 00:22:55,536
No. I only want you to
finally allow me to do my job.

318
00:22:55,713 --> 00:22:59,410
You did your job. This morning I was married,
now I'm not. You did it superbly.

319
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,108
Thank you very much.

320
00:23:01,285 --> 00:23:04,948
Here, that's fine. You keep the change.
Thank you.

321
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,651
George.

322
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,856
- Hey, that's my coffee, you jerk!
- Oh, sir, I'm so sorry.

323
00:23:16,033 --> 00:23:17,330
- Moron!
- I thought you were needy.

324
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:20,231
What's wrong with you?!
Can't a guy have a cup of coffee?!

325
00:23:20,404 --> 00:23:24,204
- It's all right. Come on, Mother Teresa.
- My only cup of the day! You ruined it!

326
00:23:33,484 --> 00:23:37,215
Okay, now, what do you think?

327
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,224
Too ornate?

328
00:23:43,294 --> 00:23:45,387
I don't care about the belt.

329
00:23:45,563 --> 00:23:46,928
You're upset.

330
00:23:47,098 --> 00:23:50,261
Look, from now on, I'll get someone else
to handle my divorces.

331
00:23:50,434 --> 00:23:52,629
It's not like I enjoy them.

332
00:23:52,803 --> 00:23:55,704
Maybe I should go somewhere where
no one knows how much money I have.

333
00:23:55,873 --> 00:23:58,364
Where is Staten Island?
Why don't we go there?

334
00:24:07,484 --> 00:24:09,645
Thanks, but Harvard
doesn't give a degree in yenta.

335
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,414
I'm not here to find you a wife
or to pick out your clothes.

336
00:24:14,491 --> 00:24:16,425
My heroes are Clarence Darrow,
Thurgood Marshall...

337
00:24:18,495 --> 00:24:20,122
Who's another non-scummy lawyer?

338
00:24:20,297 --> 00:24:22,788
My parents!
My father worked for Martin Luther King.

339
00:24:22,966 --> 00:24:24,297
My mother is a law professor.

340
00:24:24,468 --> 00:24:27,130
They taught me that lawyers
should be treated with respect.

341
00:24:27,304 --> 00:24:31,764
I have complete respect for you.
R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

342
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,808
Luce, wait. Wait!

343
00:24:38,682 --> 00:24:43,517
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
to join together Meryl and Tom...

344
00:24:43,687 --> 00:24:46,178
...as they stand before us
on this joyous day...

345
00:24:46,523 --> 00:24:50,823
...proclaim their love and enter
into that most sacred bond of all...

346
00:24:50,994 --> 00:24:53,554
...the bond of holy...

347
00:24:54,831 --> 00:24:55,855
<i>Is that yours?</i>

348
00:25:05,475 --> 00:25:07,875
I'm so sorry.

349
00:25:12,048 --> 00:25:15,074
Please continue. Everyone looks so beautiful.
Just keep going.

350
00:25:15,252 --> 00:25:17,948
Bye. You guys, I'll be right back.

351
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:20,722
Hold this for me. I'll be back.

352
00:25:33,103 --> 00:25:34,695
Twenty bucks for your cab.

353
00:25:34,871 --> 00:25:36,998
Keep the 20 and let's have dinner.

354
00:25:37,173 --> 00:25:39,641
Keep your dinner. I'll keep my 20
and we'll call it even.

355
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:41,674
- Okay, sounds good.
- Okay, bye.

356
00:25:41,845 --> 00:25:43,210
Go.

357
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:49,050
George, pick up. What's wrong?

358
00:25:49,219 --> 00:25:52,120
Don't tell me that the construction permits
didn't come through...

359
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:56,123
...because I had the application
into the Zoning Committee by 9 a.m.

360
00:26:03,967 --> 00:26:07,903
- Evening, Miss Kelson.
- Willie, told you the Mets would sweep.

361
00:26:12,709 --> 00:26:15,678
- Miss Kelson.
- Ms. Hana.

362
00:26:19,649 --> 00:26:22,675
- Good evening, Miss Kelson.
- Linda.

363
00:26:32,295 --> 00:26:36,322
- George?
- Help! I'm in my closet.

364
00:26:39,302 --> 00:26:41,236
- What is it?
- That is a very attractive.

365
00:26:43,906 --> 00:26:48,343
Okay, I'm judging the Miss New York contest
in under an hour. It's on television.

366
00:26:48,511 --> 00:26:49,773
What do you think?

367
00:26:49,946 --> 00:26:53,746
Please don't tell me you called me out
of a wedding to help you pick out a suit.

368
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:57,283
- You ran out of a wedding? That's horrible!
- You said it was an emergency!

369
00:26:57,453 --> 00:27:00,081
Didn't I memo you as to what
constitutes an emergency?

370
00:27:00,256 --> 00:27:03,521
Yes. Large meteor, severe loss of blood
and what's the third one again?

371
00:27:03,693 --> 00:27:06,184
- Death! And you're not dead.
- No.

372
00:27:06,362 --> 00:27:08,626
You weren't dead when
you called me at 3:00 a. m...

373
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:11,562
...because you had a nightmare about
becoming a member of KISS.

374
00:27:11,734 --> 00:27:14,635
Just like when you barged in
on my woman's doctor appointment...

375
00:27:14,804 --> 00:27:17,898
...to ask me which picture
to put on the cover of <i>People.</i>

376
00:27:18,074 --> 00:27:21,737
I don't like those very much. If it's any
consolation, I will be dead eventually.

377
00:27:22,211 --> 00:27:26,477
Tonight is important. I'm representing
the Wade organization. That includes you.

378
00:27:26,649 --> 00:27:27,843
Not anymore, George.

379
00:27:29,452 --> 00:27:32,319
- I'm sorry?
- You got Island Towers, I got Coney Island.

380
00:27:32,488 --> 00:27:35,855
Why don't we just call it quits, okay?
I can't take it anymore.

381
00:27:36,025 --> 00:27:37,925
- What, are you serious?
- Yes.

382
00:27:40,263 --> 00:27:43,699
Please, consider this my two weeks' notice.

383
00:27:45,868 --> 00:27:49,463
- I find you ungrateful.
- Ungrateful?

384
00:27:49,639 --> 00:27:52,267
- Yes, ungrateful.
- Ungrateful?!

385
00:27:52,442 --> 00:27:55,707
Yes. I hire you with
no corporate experience.

386
00:27:55,878 --> 00:27:59,405
I give you an apartment, a great office,
the nonfat muffin basket every morning.

387
00:27:59,582 --> 00:28:01,812
- George!
- Why do you keep your phone on?

388
00:28:03,886 --> 00:28:05,410
You crave the excitement.

389
00:28:09,892 --> 00:28:11,689
This is entirely my thing...

390
00:28:11,861 --> 00:28:14,830
...because I've managed
to turn myself into this...

391
00:28:16,899 --> 00:28:18,230
It's not like I'm enjoying it either.

392
00:28:21,503 --> 00:28:24,802
Now I can't. I'm addicted.
I have to know what you think.

393
00:28:24,974 --> 00:28:26,805
What do you think?

394
00:28:26,976 --> 00:28:29,672
I think you are the most selfish
human being on the planet.

395
00:28:29,845 --> 00:28:32,871
That's just silly. Have you met
everyone on the planet?

396
00:28:33,048 --> 00:28:35,278
Goodbye, George.

397
00:28:36,452 --> 00:28:38,716
I don't have a shirt.

398
00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:44,150
Ansel, I finally quit. He called me
out of Meryl's wedding.

399
00:28:44,326 --> 00:28:46,260
- I'll never get that moment back.
- <i>Okay.</i>

400
00:28:46,428 --> 00:28:49,295
I'll set up interviews with law firms
that do pro bono work, and...

401
00:28:49,465 --> 00:28:50,591
- <i>All right, hang on.</i>
- What?

402
00:28:50,766 --> 00:28:54,133
<i>Look, we're shipping out.</i>
<i>I gotta go. You take care of yourself.</i>

403
00:28:54,303 --> 00:28:55,429
<i>I gotta go, hon.</i>

404
00:28:55,604 --> 00:28:58,402
Okay, just don't fall in love with
any cute marine biologists.

405
00:28:58,574 --> 00:29:00,838
- <i>Okay, I promise. Bye.</i>
- Okay.

406
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:03,308
- <i>Love you.</i>
- Bye.

407
00:29:12,955 --> 00:29:15,048
I am really looking forward
to a new challenge...

408
00:29:15,224 --> 00:29:18,751
...and your firm has the optimal blend
of public and private interest law.

409
00:29:18,928 --> 00:29:21,089
Lucy, your resume is amazing.
You know that.

410
00:29:21,263 --> 00:29:23,026
But we do a lot of business with Wade.

411
00:29:23,198 --> 00:29:25,666
All the more reason for me
to make a smooth transition.

412
00:29:25,834 --> 00:29:26,823
- Lucy.
- Yes.

413
00:29:27,002 --> 00:29:29,368
George Wade called me this morning
and informed me...

414
00:29:29,538 --> 00:29:32,837
...that you are indispensable
to his organization.

415
00:29:37,046 --> 00:29:38,604
At the moment, we're not hiring.

416
00:29:39,214 --> 00:29:40,772
Then why did you agree to see me?

417
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:43,384
Honestly, we're partners
with Zodiac Construction...

418
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:46,214
They do millions of dollars
of business with Wade Realty...

419
00:29:46,388 --> 00:29:49,221
- And Mr. Wade...
- Doesn't want you to hire me.

420
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:52,321
The attorney who was planning
to quit reconsidered.

421
00:29:52,494 --> 00:29:54,519
- When did Mr. Wade call?
- Mr. Wade never called.

422
00:29:54,697 --> 00:29:56,858
- When?!
- Maybe an hour ago.

423
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,291
Make sure you massage his cloven hoof!

424
00:30:00,469 --> 00:30:02,334
I'm suddenly feeling a pain in my ass.

425
00:30:02,504 --> 00:30:05,564
I am unemployable! You called everyone
except for Slurpee Heaven!

426
00:30:05,741 --> 00:30:08,869
That is not true. I did call Slurpee Heaven.
They didn't want you.

427
00:30:09,044 --> 00:30:11,308
Heard you had attitude.
Said you weren't Slurpee material.

428
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,177
- You should really let us work on you.
- I don't like to be touched!

429
00:30:15,351 --> 00:30:17,546
I'm sorry, you guys are great.
It's not you.

430
00:30:18,487 --> 00:30:19,715
All right, listen.

431
00:30:19,888 --> 00:30:23,949
You have a contract and it says
you will work until Island Towers is finalized.

432
00:30:24,126 --> 00:30:28,119
Which is completion of construction,
or I can stop you working elsewhere.

433
00:30:28,297 --> 00:30:31,755
And there's no loopholes
because you drafted it and you're the best.

434
00:30:32,001 --> 00:30:37,268
Subconsciously, I think you drafted it that
way because you don't really want to go.

435
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:39,771
Does it kill you how well I know you?

436
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:44,838
Honey, this contract is excellent work.
I'm very proud of you.

437
00:30:45,014 --> 00:30:46,845
<i>Dad, I'm trying to get out of it.</i>

438
00:30:47,016 --> 00:30:50,383
I don't know why you went to work
for that philandering robber baron.

439
00:30:50,552 --> 00:30:52,315
<i>You usually have impeccable instincts.</i>

440
00:30:52,488 --> 00:30:55,855
<i>Look at your boyfriend, Ansel.</i>
<i>He's a dedicated environmental warrior.</i>

441
00:30:56,025 --> 00:30:59,119
This is ironclad. Houdini couldn't
get out of this contract.

442
00:30:59,294 --> 00:31:01,694
You should've stayed
at the legal aid job.

443
00:31:01,864 --> 00:31:05,095
If I do pro bono work with a company
with these resources...

444
00:31:05,267 --> 00:31:08,464
...I can accomplish so much...
- Come on over for strawberry ice cream.

445
00:31:08,637 --> 00:31:12,971
Have Tofutti! You heard what the doctor
said. Your cholesterol is over 300!

446
00:31:13,142 --> 00:31:14,700
You're basically a solid.

447
00:31:14,877 --> 00:31:18,074
Two of the greatest legal minds
in this country arguing over dessert.

448
00:31:18,247 --> 00:31:21,148
Lucy, it was your choice to work
for that man.

449
00:31:21,316 --> 00:31:24,979
You could've done anything. You could've
clerked for the Supreme Court.

450
00:31:25,154 --> 00:31:26,553
I don't know what to tell you.

451
00:31:26,722 --> 00:31:29,555
Short of going in
and deliberately trying to get fired.

452
00:31:29,725 --> 00:31:32,489
<i>You stay away from that freezer!</i>

453
00:31:48,077 --> 00:31:49,977
Good morning, boys.

454
00:31:51,513 --> 00:31:54,914
Sorry, I am so late.

455
00:31:55,084 --> 00:31:56,949
That's fine. We only just got here.

456
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:59,178
Forty-five minutes ago.

457
00:31:59,354 --> 00:32:01,151
Howie, are these your kids?

458
00:32:02,257 --> 00:32:04,191
You know, I've never actually met them.

459
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:06,987
They are good-Iooking boys.

460
00:32:07,162 --> 00:32:10,996
That's a girl. That's Sue and Paul.

461
00:32:12,101 --> 00:32:15,036
Yes, so it is.

462
00:32:15,204 --> 00:32:19,197
You know what?
She is gonna be a heartbreaker.

463
00:32:19,541 --> 00:32:21,839
That's Paul.

464
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:24,774
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Sorry.

465
00:32:27,216 --> 00:32:29,980
So we've got the Coney Island project.

466
00:32:30,152 --> 00:32:33,121
I'd like to stir up some publicity if we could.

467
00:32:36,391 --> 00:32:38,552
Yes, very nice.

468
00:32:41,797 --> 00:32:43,560
I'm...

469
00:32:45,734 --> 00:32:49,761
I'm working on endorsements
from local merchants.

470
00:32:57,845 --> 00:33:02,248
We were working
on some ideas there.

471
00:33:05,386 --> 00:33:06,785
I thought that was terrific.

472
00:33:09,156 --> 00:33:10,646
- Pathetic.
- What's pathetic?

473
00:33:10,825 --> 00:33:13,760
- You. I know what you're doing.
- I am not doing anything.

474
00:33:13,928 --> 00:33:17,420
You think if you come in late and spit
on the boss that will get you fired?

475
00:33:17,598 --> 00:33:19,327
Not in this company.

476
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,832
- Chris.
- George.

477
00:33:25,139 --> 00:33:26,766
George, I have an ulcer.

478
00:33:26,941 --> 00:33:29,933
I don't sleep well, mostly because
you keep calling me at night.

479
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,442
If you don't call me,
I dream you're gonna call me.

480
00:33:32,613 --> 00:33:35,446
I think about you in the shower,
not in a good way...

481
00:33:35,616 --> 00:33:38,949
...but in an I'm-so-distracted-I-can't-
remember-if-I washed-my-hair way.

482
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,950
So I wash my hair twice.

483
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:44,249
So I have a hole in my stomach,
I am running out of shampoo...

484
00:33:44,425 --> 00:33:48,293
...and today is the first time in my life
I did not give a 1000 percent on the job...

485
00:33:48,462 --> 00:33:51,124
...and I hate that feeling!

486
00:33:56,637 --> 00:34:00,937
- I won't call after hours.
- You will, George! You know you will.

487
00:34:01,642 --> 00:34:03,041
Yeah, I will.

488
00:34:04,378 --> 00:34:10,146
I just don't think we can see each other
professionally anymore.

489
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:21,627
All right. Stay until you find
a replacement.

490
00:34:21,795 --> 00:34:25,060
Train him up for a couple of weeks,
then you can go to Slurpee Heaven.

491
00:34:25,733 --> 00:34:28,998
Thank you! I promise I will find
you somebody amazing.

492
00:34:29,169 --> 00:34:31,831
Somebody better than me
because I'm not even any good.

493
00:34:32,006 --> 00:34:35,237
- No.
- A glorified ambulance chaser.

494
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:39,075
Thank you.

495
00:34:51,692 --> 00:34:54,252
I got it. It's just my earring.

496
00:34:56,263 --> 00:34:58,857
- My hair!
- Careful! That's my overpriced Italian belt.

497
00:34:59,033 --> 00:35:01,831
Just get it off!

498
00:35:02,603 --> 00:35:04,537
Howard.

499
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:07,872
Join us. We were just brainstorming.

500
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:10,440
- Lucy?
- Yes.

501
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:15,548
I was thinking it might be a good idea
to do a photo op at the build site...

502
00:35:15,716 --> 00:35:18,549
...where George would be in the...

503
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,350
George in the foreground,
pointing up to the sky...

504
00:35:22,523 --> 00:35:24,115
...like this.
- Yes.

505
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:29,285
Then I thought I could take my belt off,
as if to say, let's get to work!

506
00:35:29,463 --> 00:35:32,398
Right. Right-o.

507
00:35:32,967 --> 00:35:36,232
On behalf of Wade Corporation,
I'd like to thank the Community Board...

508
00:35:36,403 --> 00:35:39,429
...for giving us the opportunity
to work with you on this project.

509
00:35:39,606 --> 00:35:42,803
And we look forward to seeing
all of you at the groundbreaking.

510
00:35:43,277 --> 00:35:44,904
I did well with those eight people.

511
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:47,547
- I thought you were fantastic.
- This way, Mr. Wade.

512
00:35:47,715 --> 00:35:48,841
Just Mr. Wade.

513
00:35:49,416 --> 00:35:52,146
- More.
- Great. Can we go now?

514
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:55,152
Absolutely. I just want to say hello
to my folks.

515
00:35:55,322 --> 00:35:56,311
Folks?

516
00:35:56,657 --> 00:35:58,488
Excuse me.

517
00:35:59,193 --> 00:36:00,319
Hello.

518
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:01,552
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Daddy.

519
00:36:01,729 --> 00:36:03,526
- Is that a new coat? I like it.
- Thanks.

520
00:36:03,697 --> 00:36:08,361
What a wonderful surprise!
We finally meet after all this time.

521
00:36:08,535 --> 00:36:09,832
George Wade.

522
00:36:10,004 --> 00:36:12,165
Mrs. Kelson, I presume.

523
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:13,397
What a pleasure.

524
00:36:18,779 --> 00:36:23,842
Well, I can certainly see
where Lucy gets her stare from.

525
00:36:24,018 --> 00:36:25,952
I'm Larry. It's a pleasure to meet you.

526
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,179
Thanks, Larry. Same here.

527
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:31,188
Thank you for letting Lucy quit.
It certainly made our week.

528
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:34,020
- Great pleasure.
- We should get back to the office.

529
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:36,128
- Come on! Have some cake.
- We can't.

530
00:36:36,296 --> 00:36:38,526
We're two blocks from the apartment.

531
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:39,996
- You live around here?
- Sure.

532
00:36:40,167 --> 00:36:42,635
- What a charming coincidence.
- It won't be charming...

533
00:36:42,803 --> 00:36:47,467
...once you block out the sun
with this condo-hotel monstrosity!

534
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:51,303
We will have a sun deck.

535
00:36:53,047 --> 00:36:55,242
That's something, isn't it?

536
00:36:55,482 --> 00:36:59,213
Larry, Ruth, I can't tell you how much
I appreciate your support on this project.

537
00:36:59,386 --> 00:37:02,219
At least you're keeping
the community center.

538
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:05,381
Unless you're willing to reconsider
the entire project.

539
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:08,494
I'm afraid that won't happen.
It is over 50 million in profits.

540
00:37:08,662 --> 00:37:12,154
I think it's immoral that any human being
should acquire that much wealth.

541
00:37:12,332 --> 00:37:13,993
I don't know how you sleep at night.

542
00:37:14,168 --> 00:37:15,362
A machine that plays the ocean.

543
00:37:23,443 --> 00:37:28,176
I used to come up here all the time
when I was a kid. My special place.

544
00:37:30,517 --> 00:37:32,382
I had a small one-bedroom
on Park and 91st.

545
00:37:34,454 --> 00:37:36,684
That's so very <i>Oliver Twist</i>.

546
00:37:36,856 --> 00:37:40,417
Times were hard. But you know what?
We were happy.

547
00:37:41,961 --> 00:37:45,362
- Didn't have a view as good as this.
- It's great, isn't it?

548
00:37:45,532 --> 00:37:48,695
I used to take up some ice cream
and my Carole King tape...

549
00:37:48,868 --> 00:37:50,335
...and look at the neighborhood.

550
00:37:50,503 --> 00:37:54,098
It's amazing what you could see. At night,
the whole building went downstairs.

551
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:57,368
The fathers stood on one corner.
The mothers stood on the other.

552
00:37:57,544 --> 00:38:00,877
Kids would just ride their bicycles around.

553
00:38:01,047 --> 00:38:03,538
As you can see, not much has changed.

554
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:07,047
Mr. and Mrs. Goldfarb would be sitting
in the middle of the street...

555
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:11,884
...saving a parking space for their children
who were coming next weekend.

556
00:38:13,226 --> 00:38:15,558
And you up here on your own.

557
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:18,992
It's hard to find a quiet place
in Brooklyn to think.

558
00:38:20,233 --> 00:38:24,533
Or to replay whatever argument
I just had with my mother.

559
00:38:25,572 --> 00:38:27,130
Yes.

560
00:38:27,307 --> 00:38:29,298
Yeah, she's terrifying.

561
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:32,570
I thought she was gonna kill me
and feed me to the poor.

562
00:38:32,745 --> 00:38:35,077
Yeah, she's a piece of work.

563
00:38:36,082 --> 00:38:40,416
But for better or worse, she's the voice
in my head pushing me to do better.

564
00:38:40,587 --> 00:38:44,580
Challenge the accepted wisdom. Never
settle for a B instead of an A on a test.

565
00:38:44,757 --> 00:38:45,917
You once got a B?

566
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:49,026
- Hypothetically speaking.
- Right.

567
00:38:49,762 --> 00:38:55,598
Of course, no matter how hard I try,
I will never live up to her expectations.

568
00:38:56,769 --> 00:39:01,229
Well, there are worse things in life.
Like no one having any expectations.

569
00:39:10,617 --> 00:39:13,609
There's something amuck
with this sponge cake.

570
00:39:14,187 --> 00:39:16,121
Tofu.

571
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:33,202
You're not concentrating.
This offends me.

572
00:39:33,373 --> 00:39:35,466
Yeah, I'm sorry, Ton.

573
00:39:35,642 --> 00:39:36,939
I lost Lucy.

574
00:39:39,212 --> 00:39:42,875
I just think it's a shame because I've
come to rely on her for everything.

575
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:47,213
And I trust her completely,
and she's funny.

576
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:49,651
Not deliberately, of course.

577
00:39:49,822 --> 00:39:52,313
Hey, you know, it's probably
for the best though.

578
00:39:52,492 --> 00:39:54,790
Oh, yeah? Why is that?

579
00:39:55,495 --> 00:39:58,794
Two things I know is chess and women.

580
00:40:00,066 --> 00:40:04,901
Chess, it has rules, pieces,
rooks, knights, bishops.

581
00:40:05,071 --> 00:40:08,905
They move in predictable patterns.
Somebody wins, somebody loses.

582
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:12,511
But women, they don't have no rules, man.

583
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:14,840
They move in unpredictable ways too.

584
00:40:15,014 --> 00:40:17,505
Nobody ever wins or loses
when it comes to women.

585
00:40:17,684 --> 00:40:21,017
You talk about your feelings
until your breath is sucked out your body.

586
00:40:22,021 --> 00:40:24,751
All men are pawns when it comes
to women.

587
00:40:24,924 --> 00:40:28,189
Especially a smart one like Lucy.
She's hard to control.

588
00:40:28,361 --> 00:40:31,819
And you know, the man has got
to be in control.

589
00:40:33,232 --> 00:40:34,756
Like with me.

590
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:39,962
I come home. When I walk in,
I know my mama has dinner on the table.

591
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:44,706
All right, so you're still living at home?

592
00:40:45,378 --> 00:40:47,369
Yeah. Yeah.

593
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,441
Of course.

594
00:40:54,053 --> 00:40:57,147
Here's somebody interesting,
Polly St. Clair.

595
00:40:57,323 --> 00:41:01,783
Well, it's a terrific resume, Polly.

596
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:03,690
Congratulations on the baby.

597
00:41:04,063 --> 00:41:05,121
What baby?

598
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:09,466
Maybe you should check with me
before you talk.

599
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:11,627
What baby?

600
00:41:14,407 --> 00:41:16,705
I'd like to talk about
your moot-court experience.

601
00:41:16,876 --> 00:41:17,968
What baby?

602
00:41:18,311 --> 00:41:20,404
Yeah, what baby?

603
00:41:26,352 --> 00:41:27,751
You should do the interviews on your own.

604
00:41:35,094 --> 00:41:37,289
Harry Raskin, Richard Beck.

605
00:41:39,365 --> 00:41:41,299
Interesting prospects for my replacement.
Let's see.

606
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:44,764
No, it's gotta be a woman.

607
00:41:44,937 --> 00:41:46,097
What a surprise.

608
00:41:46,272 --> 00:41:49,901
I suppose a certain bust size would help.
Maybe some bathing-suit shots?

609
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:53,501
It will annoy Howard if it's a woman.

610
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:55,010
- Thank you.
- Tell you what.

611
00:41:55,181 --> 00:41:57,274
All I want is someone
as intelligent as you...

612
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:59,509
...but a little less tense
and argumentative.

613
00:41:59,685 --> 00:42:02,779
A sort of Katharine Hepburn figure.

614
00:42:02,955 --> 00:42:04,684
You don't deserve Katharine Hepburn.

615
00:42:04,857 --> 00:42:06,290
- Audrey Hepburn.
- Also too good.

616
00:42:06,459 --> 00:42:08,359
Just stay away from the Hepburns.

617
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:09,960
You forgot a beet.

618
00:42:10,129 --> 00:42:11,790
Beet.

619
00:42:12,465 --> 00:42:14,126
Thank you.

620
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:29,143
I've got that charity tennis thing tonight.

621
00:42:29,315 --> 00:42:33,945
And I need to know, does this shirt make
me look a bit kind of Bjorn Borg?

622
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:38,318
Ansel and I got into a huge fight,
and I think we just broke up.

623
00:42:38,557 --> 00:42:39,546
Really?

624
00:42:39,725 --> 00:42:42,489
He wants me to go on a Greenpeace boat.

625
00:42:42,661 --> 00:42:44,492
He thinks I can't embrace life.

626
00:42:44,663 --> 00:42:47,063
Is that the case?
Because I just don't see it.

627
00:42:47,233 --> 00:42:48,757
I just don't see it.

628
00:42:49,068 --> 00:42:52,834
And by the way, how can I embrace him
when he is never here?

629
00:42:53,005 --> 00:42:58,466
Maybe it's me. Maybe the rose-colored
glasses have finally come off.

630
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,579
Okay.

631
00:43:02,748 --> 00:43:05,683
We obviously can't leave you alone
with the stapler.

632
00:43:05,851 --> 00:43:08,479
I'll tell you what. I'll cancel tennis.

633
00:43:08,654 --> 00:43:11,851
They always make me play with Ed Koch.
What can we do to cheer you up?

634
00:43:12,024 --> 00:43:13,457
Nothing. There's no solution.

635
00:43:13,626 --> 00:43:14,991
Good. Good attitude.

636
00:43:15,161 --> 00:43:16,924
I can't help it if I don't like boats.

637
00:43:18,864 --> 00:43:20,331
Surely not all boats.

638
00:43:20,499 --> 00:43:23,366
Yes, all boats.

639
00:43:25,371 --> 00:43:28,863
I don't understand.
What is wrong with me?

640
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:31,373
At the moment,
huge quantities of alcohol.

641
00:43:31,544 --> 00:43:34,274
I don't know. I just seem
to drive men away.

642
00:43:34,447 --> 00:43:36,381
There's Ansel.

643
00:43:36,549 --> 00:43:39,450
There's Billy from Legal Aid who ran
off with a stripper.

644
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:42,382
Don't forget Gary from the Peace Corps
who married his trainer.

645
00:43:42,555 --> 00:43:44,455
Gary, yes.

646
00:43:44,623 --> 00:43:48,286
What is wrong with me? I want to know.
You're sort of a man.

647
00:43:51,297 --> 00:43:53,788
- All right?
- I'm good.

648
00:43:56,068 --> 00:43:59,128
So tell me. What's the matter with me?

649
00:43:59,305 --> 00:44:02,206
Well, you can be somewhat intimidating.

650
00:44:02,741 --> 00:44:05,972
You could loosen up a little,
get in touch with your feminine side.

651
00:44:06,145 --> 00:44:09,979
- Okay, that's a good suggestion.
- Perhaps soften your appearance.

652
00:44:10,149 --> 00:44:15,644
Not that I don't love that look,
but you could get dolled up occasionally.

653
00:44:15,821 --> 00:44:18,756
I'm not going to spend hours
fluffing my hair and applying...

654
00:44:18,924 --> 00:44:20,653
...animal-tested makeup to my face...

655
00:44:20,826 --> 00:44:26,264
...just so I can turn myself into some
male fantasy, degrading Kewpie doll.

656
00:44:26,432 --> 00:44:29,595
Unless I, you know, really like the guy
or something.

657
00:44:29,768 --> 00:44:32,100
You see, maybe that's the problem.

658
00:44:32,271 --> 00:44:34,000
You don't like these guys.

659
00:44:34,173 --> 00:44:37,574
You drive them away because you realize,
deep down, they're wrong for you.

660
00:44:37,743 --> 00:44:38,903
They're not wrong for me.

661
00:44:39,178 --> 00:44:44,115
We have all the same political goals
and ideals, all of them.

662
00:44:44,283 --> 00:44:48,185
Which I guess isn't very romantic,
but what can I say?

663
00:44:48,354 --> 00:44:51,517
I'm fine. What can I say?
I'm just not a romantic person.

664
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:54,853
Never felt that way about anybody.
Nope. No.

665
00:44:55,027 --> 00:44:58,963
No, in high school, Rick Beck took
me parking. You know, parking?

666
00:44:59,131 --> 00:45:01,964
And the whole time I talked
about Nelson Mandela.

667
00:45:02,134 --> 00:45:04,034
Don't know why I did that.

668
00:45:04,203 --> 00:45:08,071
That is hard to say. I certainly would have
found it extremely erotic. Come back.

669
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,140
I'm fine.

670
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,905
I don't know. Maybe I'm
just not good in bed.

671
00:45:17,149 --> 00:45:19,049
Maybe you're not.

672
00:45:21,387 --> 00:45:23,378
I am.

673
00:45:23,656 --> 00:45:27,319
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I am really good in bed.

674
00:45:27,493 --> 00:45:30,223
- You might be lousy.
- No, believe me, pal.

675
00:45:30,396 --> 00:45:33,832
You should be so lucky because
the lawyerly exterior...

676
00:45:33,999 --> 00:45:38,834
...don't let that fool you because
inside I am, like, a complete animal.

677
00:45:39,004 --> 00:45:42,337
It's, like, bobcat. You know, it's scary.

678
00:45:42,508 --> 00:45:48,174
- I can see that it might be.
- No. No. Look, I can bend like a pretzel.

679
00:45:49,582 --> 00:45:51,015
I'm serious.

680
00:45:51,183 --> 00:45:54,846
And I'm not talking the straight kind.
I'm talking, like, the twisty kind.

681
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:59,423
Twisty like the bobcat,
salty type of pretzel.

682
00:45:59,592 --> 00:46:02,083
Because that's what men want, right?

683
00:46:02,261 --> 00:46:05,094
- That is their dream.
- The twisty-bobcat kind of pretzel...

684
00:46:05,264 --> 00:46:10,031
...because that's what you want, and I bet
I could give you a twisty-bobcat pretzel.

685
00:46:10,202 --> 00:46:12,033
Do you want it?

686
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:23,940
You're a really good listener.

687
00:46:27,052 --> 00:46:28,883
Luce?

688
00:46:29,555 --> 00:46:31,216
Luce?

689
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:35,724
Are you...? Hello?

690
00:46:36,228 --> 00:46:37,889
Cormac!

691
00:46:38,063 --> 00:46:39,724
Help!

692
00:46:40,366 --> 00:46:41,355
Help!

693
00:46:53,245 --> 00:46:55,236
I'll just get her upstairs.

694
00:46:55,414 --> 00:46:57,075
Think you can make it?

695
00:46:57,249 --> 00:47:00,650
No. No, let's put her somewhere else.

696
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,487
Good.

697
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:15,493
Good.

698
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,133
Like a doll.

699
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:26,743
A doll with a sinus problem.

700
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:31,007
We should put a pillow under her head.
I think that helps.

701
00:47:38,122 --> 00:47:39,851
Good.

702
00:47:41,292 --> 00:47:42,316
Much worse. Interesting.

703
00:47:46,548 --> 00:47:49,608
Do you think we should change
her clothes?

704
00:47:50,285 --> 00:47:53,618
Right. Don't know where that came from.

705
00:47:56,224 --> 00:47:57,714
Morning!

706
00:47:57,892 --> 00:48:01,225
Okay, not so loud.

707
00:48:03,398 --> 00:48:05,298
We didn't...

708
00:48:06,734 --> 00:48:09,464
Last... We didn't...

709
00:48:10,138 --> 00:48:12,072
It was a magical night.

710
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,403
You made sounds I've never heard
a woman make before.

711
00:48:17,245 --> 00:48:19,304
We didn't...

712
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:23,583
Not physically, but spiritually,
you were the best I've ever had.

713
00:48:25,753 --> 00:48:31,487
Whatever I did or didn't do
or said or didn't say...

714
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:34,924
...it was all a little mistake.

715
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:37,756
Well, nothing happened.

716
00:48:41,169 --> 00:48:43,262
That's a relief.

717
00:48:46,774 --> 00:48:49,607
I'm very busy. I have work to do.
You stay there and relax.

718
00:48:49,777 --> 00:48:52,610
Okay, I'll see you later.

719
00:48:57,452 --> 00:48:59,044
Lucy!

720
00:48:59,721 --> 00:49:00,779
Jesus, careful.

721
00:49:02,457 --> 00:49:04,891
There's a June Carver to see you.

722
00:49:05,126 --> 00:49:08,118
- June Carver, June Carver, June Carver.
- She went to Harvard.

723
00:49:08,296 --> 00:49:10,890
Yeah, well, so did I. Now look at me.

724
00:49:11,966 --> 00:49:13,957
Norman. Norman. Norman.

725
00:49:14,135 --> 00:49:15,932
- Norman!
- Sorry.

726
00:49:16,971 --> 00:49:19,531
She didn't have a strong background
in property law.

727
00:49:19,974 --> 00:49:23,137
She's down from Boston.
She only wants five minutes.

728
00:49:26,481 --> 00:49:28,312
Lucy.

729
00:49:28,483 --> 00:49:30,110
Lucy.

730
00:49:30,285 --> 00:49:31,877
This is June Carver.

731
00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:36,054
- Hi. It's a pleasure to meet you.
- You too.

732
00:49:36,224 --> 00:49:39,091
I don't have an appointment,
so feel free to throw me out.

733
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:41,922
Well, I have security on standby.

734
00:49:42,096 --> 00:49:44,496
- Have a seat, please.
- Thanks.

735
00:49:44,832 --> 00:49:47,926
Did you have Criminal
with Professor Rappaport?

736
00:49:48,102 --> 00:49:50,798
- Oh, my God. I'm still shaking.
- Yeah.

737
00:49:50,972 --> 00:49:55,068
But I have to tell you, Miss Kelson,
you are a legend there.

738
00:49:55,243 --> 00:49:57,234
- Me?
- Editor of the <i>Law Review</i>.

739
00:49:57,412 --> 00:50:00,813
The articles you wrote on
the Richmond case. You're an inspiration.

740
00:50:01,182 --> 00:50:02,513
Well, yeah, I...

741
00:50:02,684 --> 00:50:05,847
I don't have a strong background
in property, but neither did you...

742
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:09,251
...and look what you've accomplished.

743
00:50:09,424 --> 00:50:11,892
Well, you know, not that much, really.
I just...

744
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:14,028
And there's this.

745
00:50:14,195 --> 00:50:15,685
I've never met Mr. Wade...

746
00:50:15,863 --> 00:50:18,696
...but in <i>Public Policy</i> magazine
he was interviewed...

747
00:50:18,866 --> 00:50:23,235
...about the challenges
of urban development and he said that...

748
00:50:23,404 --> 00:50:25,872
Is it ridiculous that I'm quoting this?

749
00:50:26,374 --> 00:50:27,500
No, not yet.

750
00:50:27,675 --> 00:50:31,941
"Architecture can shape a community
and turn strangers into neighbors.

751
00:50:32,113 --> 00:50:34,707
The right design for a park
makes people feel secure.

752
00:50:34,882 --> 00:50:37,578
A school building can be functional
and beautiful...

753
00:50:37,752 --> 00:50:41,051
...so kids feel engaged instead
of imprisoned."

754
00:50:41,222 --> 00:50:44,385
When I read that, it made me feel
I'd be working for a cause...

755
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:45,651
...not just a company.

756
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:51,022
Okay. You're hired.

757
00:50:51,399 --> 00:50:52,730
You're Mr. Wade.

758
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,130
Someone has to be.
Although, I didn't write that.

759
00:50:55,303 --> 00:50:57,794
- Lucy did.
- No, you did. I remember being shocked.

760
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:01,572
We've been working together so long
it's hard to remember who did what.

761
00:51:01,743 --> 00:51:04,234
- Sounds like an amazing team.
- George, do you mind...?

762
00:51:04,412 --> 00:51:09,145
I was saying how incredibly presumptuous
it was of me to come waltzing in here...

763
00:51:09,317 --> 00:51:11,478
...but Miss Kelson was nice enough
to see me.

764
00:51:11,653 --> 00:51:14,247
They're calling from
the Zoning Commission, Lucy.

765
00:51:14,422 --> 00:51:19,086
June, why don't we set up
a proper interview for tomorrow.

766
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:24,027
It's all right. It's all right.
I could finish up with June.

767
00:51:24,198 --> 00:51:26,098
You're not coming to the meeting?

768
00:51:26,267 --> 00:51:28,735
- Have I ever come to the meeting?
- Good point.

769
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:31,830
- Alrighty.
- Alrighty.

770
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:34,338
Stupid plant. Do something
with this, will you?

771
00:51:34,509 --> 00:51:37,000
Absolutely. The ficus is fired.

772
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:39,112
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

773
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,941
- So tell me...
- Yes.

774
00:51:41,115 --> 00:51:43,879
...first of all, you come from which...?
- Harvard.

775
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:47,955
I was just wondering, are we still on
for the Mets game tonight?

776
00:51:48,122 --> 00:51:49,919
I love baseball.

777
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:51,783
So are we still good?

778
00:51:51,959 --> 00:51:54,120
I'm a Red Sox fan, all the way.

779
00:51:54,295 --> 00:51:56,525
A Red Sox fan? Interesting.

780
00:51:56,698 --> 00:52:01,294
You obviously have a rich fantasy life
which is a fabulous plus in this company.

781
00:52:01,469 --> 00:52:05,462
Okay, that means you're a Boston girl,
probably a little bit Irish, Catholic...

782
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,040
...big family, dirty, that kind of thing.
- Exactly.

783
00:52:08,209 --> 00:52:12,441
<i>Let's go, Mets! Let's go, Mets!</i>
<i>Let's go, Mets!</i>

784
00:52:12,613 --> 00:52:13,602
Strike him out!

785
00:52:13,781 --> 00:52:15,874
So, what did you think of June?

786
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,108
Loved her. Loved her.

787
00:52:17,552 --> 00:52:19,110
Great. Yeah, me too.

788
00:52:19,287 --> 00:52:21,812
Yeah, she smiled obsequiously,
flattered me constantly.

789
00:52:21,989 --> 00:52:25,618
She'd have no problem picking out
an ottoman. Exactly what I'm looking for.

790
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:28,054
A tad weak on the experience side, but...

791
00:52:28,229 --> 00:52:30,322
We went out for a drink,
talked for an hour.

792
00:52:30,498 --> 00:52:34,662
She's a very clever girl, you know. Sharp.

793
00:52:36,504 --> 00:52:39,337
So you guys went out for a drink and...

794
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:43,308
She got nowhere to stay at the moment,
so I found her a room at the Grand.

795
00:52:43,478 --> 00:52:48,347
And I invited her to the company outing.
Turns out she's a useful tennis player.

796
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:51,478
Well, I can swing a racket.

797
00:52:51,652 --> 00:52:53,677
Yes, I know, at my head.
I've experienced it.

798
00:52:53,855 --> 00:52:56,915
But listen, thanks to you
for finding her. Genius.

799
00:52:58,092 --> 00:52:59,992
Oh, God! It's gonna hit us!

800
00:53:00,361 --> 00:53:01,953
Get out of the way. Move!

801
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:05,364
- Mike, you all right?
- Yeah.

802
00:53:05,533 --> 00:53:08,366
- Take it easy, the season just started.
- Thanks, George.

803
00:53:08,536 --> 00:53:10,299
Next time, go to a Yankees game.

804
00:53:17,278 --> 00:53:18,609
Hey, look, you're on TV.

805
00:53:22,884 --> 00:53:24,511
<i>I don't hear you.</i>
<i>I don't hear you.</i>

806
00:53:57,084 --> 00:53:58,415
Nice!

807
00:53:58,586 --> 00:54:00,486
- Nice one.
- Thank you.

808
00:54:16,604 --> 00:54:19,767
- Three-Iove.
- All right. Cool.

809
00:54:30,451 --> 00:54:32,009
Nice.

810
00:54:45,867 --> 00:54:47,858
Yeah!

811
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:49,866
Mine, mine, mine! Okay!

812
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:51,231
Come on!

813
00:55:07,622 --> 00:55:10,591
Lucy! Oh, my God, Lucy, are you okay?

814
00:55:10,758 --> 00:55:12,658
Do I have a concussion?
Ask me something.

815
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:17,361
- Name all the Supreme Court Justices.
- Thomas, Ginsburg, Scalia, Stevens...

816
00:55:17,532 --> 00:55:20,501
...Kennedy, Rehnquist, Souter, Breyer,
O'Connor. Is that right?

817
00:55:21,002 --> 00:55:21,991
How should I know?

818
00:55:24,839 --> 00:55:26,238
Want some?

819
00:55:26,407 --> 00:55:28,170
Thanks, I really shouldn't.

820
00:55:28,342 --> 00:55:29,331
Okay.

821
00:55:35,516 --> 00:55:38,076
You think she's a natural redhead?

822
00:55:53,034 --> 00:55:56,197
You know, I was gonna give June a lift,
and then Howard offered.

823
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:59,032
The fact that he liked her is
a big strike against her.

824
00:55:59,206 --> 00:56:03,939
Although I will say she's
an excellent tennis player. Very nice form.

825
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:05,703
- Fantastically nice form.
- Oh, man.

826
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,371
Incredibly lithe.

827
00:56:08,549 --> 00:56:11,109
What? I thought you liked her too.

828
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:14,948
No, I jus... I think I just ate too much.

829
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:17,886
Really? What did you have?

830
00:56:18,059 --> 00:56:22,393
Just a chili dog and some fries
and a soda...

831
00:56:22,563 --> 00:56:25,964
...and a bag of some little girl's
cookies...

832
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:28,897
...and another chili dog
stuck in there somewhere.

833
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:30,469
Okay.

834
00:56:30,638 --> 00:56:32,299
Let's try and take your mind off it.

835
00:56:32,473 --> 00:56:34,373
Okay.

836
00:56:34,542 --> 00:56:36,032
Heard from Ansel lately?

837
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:39,078
I'm sorry.

838
00:56:39,246 --> 00:56:42,079
I've been thinking about this.
You should move on. Forget him.

839
00:56:42,249 --> 00:56:45,946
Plenty of other pebbles on the beach.
The world must be full of men who'd die...

840
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,680
...to be with a compulsive
eater who can't fall in love.

841
00:56:48,856 --> 00:56:51,256
What? I've fallen in love.

842
00:56:51,425 --> 00:56:53,086
- Yeah?
- Yes!

843
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:55,854
With whom, might I ask?

844
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:57,088
And no pets.

845
00:57:04,839 --> 00:57:06,568
Billy Westhouse.

846
00:57:07,108 --> 00:57:08,336
Billy who?

847
00:57:08,509 --> 00:57:11,603
Westhouse. I knew him in high school.

848
00:57:11,779 --> 00:57:14,043
Did you tell Billy that you loved him?

849
00:57:14,215 --> 00:57:18,618
Did you say, "Billy, I love you"?

850
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:31,020
Goodness!

851
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:32,358
It's not funny.

852
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:34,467
Sorry.

853
00:57:35,469 --> 00:57:38,131
That last chili dog is really barking.

854
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:42,424
It's not perfect timing, I must say.

855
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:47,690
We'll be in the city in 20 minutes.

856
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:51,061
I don't have 20 seconds!
I feel like I swallowed a cruise missile.

857
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:55,431
What...? What am I? 5 years old?

858
00:57:58,074 --> 00:58:00,907
- It's only a Volvo.
- Well, people just don't go in Volvos!

859
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:03,477
- I'll buy you another Volvo.
- No!

860
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:06,240
That'll be the only thing you'll ever
remember about me.

861
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:09,476
I'll be the woman who went
on the front seat!

862
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:12,086
That would be hard to forget.

863
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:19,587
Okay, I have an idea. See that RV?

864
00:58:20,763 --> 00:58:22,890
- Yes.
- That is our target.

865
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:25,291
Can you make it?
Therein lies your salvation.

866
00:58:25,468 --> 00:58:27,163
- No.
- Yes, it's an excellent idea.

867
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:30,829
- It's unclean! I can hold it!
- It's a brain wave. Out of the car!

868
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:36,536
I can hold it! George, I can hold it!
I'm holding it! I'm fine, I can hold it!

869
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:42,680
No! No, no, George, I don't want...
I'm not going. I'm holding!

870
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:49,047
Hi there!

871
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:02,034
- You all right?
- Yes.

872
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:04,362
- Okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

873
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,873
- You all right?
- I'm good.

874
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,374
- What?
- My ankle. My ankle.

875
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,976
No! No, no! Oh, God! No!

876
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:15,951
Hi, there!

877
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:20,152
Oh, God!

878
00:59:22,825 --> 00:59:24,417
Excuse me. Sorry to bother you.

879
00:59:24,594 --> 00:59:27,995
I'm not insane, but my friend needs to use
a bathroom. It's an emergency.

880
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:30,155
- I'll give you $100.
- A thousand!

881
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:31,493
Okay.

882
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:33,158
Thank you. Very sweet of you.

883
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:35,167
Thank you.

884
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:10,300
Clean, clean, clean.

885
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:12,299
Where are you guys from?

886
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:17,335
Well, Kentucky originally,
but now this is pretty much home.

887
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:24,545
Come here, babies.

888
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:26,348
Hurry!

889
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:31,791
What kind of mileage do you get
out of this thing? It's an RV, right?

890
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:34,452
A recreational vehicle?

891
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:37,297
Traffic's moving.

892
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:40,027
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it one sec!

893
01:00:40,203 --> 01:00:42,728
Honey, how are you doing?
Are you nearly ready?

894
01:00:42,905 --> 01:00:44,805
Kill me!

895
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:53,172
Look at that poor jerk.

896
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:56,147
Yes, poor jerk.

897
01:00:56,919 --> 01:00:58,978
Whoa, Nelly.

898
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,261
George, where's the car?

899
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:08,260
I'm sure it's been safely towed by now.

900
01:01:08,431 --> 01:01:10,831
Oh, God! George, George, George!

901
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,198
Don't worry, don't worry! In many ways,
it was the perfect end to the day.

902
01:01:15,371 --> 01:01:17,498
Except for those poor children
in the trailer.

903
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:20,268
They actually looked quite frightened.

904
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,342
Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.

905
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:27,609
Once it's published in the company
newsletter, there'd be absolutely no point.

906
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:32,287
All right, I'll call for a lift.

907
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,124
Would you like to have
your nails done?

908
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,190
A Hollywood tan, perhaps?

909
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:29,538
God, it is such a beautiful city.

910
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:32,140
And my favorite building of all time.
Look at that.

911
01:02:32,348 --> 01:02:35,146
Nirosta steel, sunburst tower,
gleaming gargoyles...

912
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:37,980
...all designed by a man called
William Van Alen...

913
01:02:38,154 --> 01:02:40,122
...obsessed with beating
his former partner...

914
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:43,622
...who was building the
Bank of Manhattan tower at 927 feet.

915
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:47,729
So Van Alen announced
the Chrysler Building at 925 feet...

916
01:02:47,897 --> 01:02:51,924
...and then surreptitiously assembled
the 180-foot mast inside the tower...

917
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:55,036
...and only revealed it after
the bank tower had been completed...

918
01:02:55,204 --> 01:02:57,900
...giving Van Alen the tallest building
for three months...

919
01:02:58,074 --> 01:03:00,668
...until of course...
- Until the Empire State Building.

920
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:09,844
All right, please give me the name
of Van Alen's former partner.

921
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:14,051
Who is H. Craig Severance?

922
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:21,924
- I find you annoying.
- Yes, I'm sure you do.

923
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:28,160
But it is pretty amazing what dreams
and lots of money can do, isn't it?

924
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:30,463
Yes, it is.

925
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:34,976
- And you know you're part of that, George.
- Yes, I am.

926
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:39,078
All you have to do is use your power
for good instead of evil.

927
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:42,040
If only I would.

928
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:46,146
Listen...

929
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:50,185
...I'm very sorry that these last couple
of months have been unbearable for you.

930
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:53,888
Not at all.
Unbearable would have been bearable.

931
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:58,329
Then I suppose it's a good thing
that your two weeks are almost up.

932
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:00,759
This is it.

933
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:04,236
I'll do the Children's League benefit.
I'll make sure June is set up.

934
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:06,705
I'll take a pass at your speech
for the groundbreaking...

935
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:08,901
...and I'll be out of your life forever.

936
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:11,042
Great.

937
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:13,205
Super.

938
01:04:34,003 --> 01:04:37,234
- Hi.
- Hey, hey.

939
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:41,332
- I have tennis elbow from the other day.
- Oh, yes?

940
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:47,574
- Lucy has tennis forehead. Much worse.
- Oh, no. I still feel terrible about that.

941
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:50,009
Thank God she looks okay.

942
01:04:50,186 --> 01:04:53,314
Especially with that big benefit
you're all going to tonight.

943
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:55,923
- What was it again?
- It's a benefit...

944
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:59,323
...for the New York Children's League.
Lucy makes us give lots of money...

945
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:02,396
...to help society and get a tax break.
Brilliant.

946
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:04,863
- Sounds exciting.
- It would be almost impossible...

947
01:05:05,034 --> 01:05:09,494
...to tell you how boring it is.
Largely because it would be too boring.

948
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:15,806
Well, boring to you might be scintillating
for a girl from Plainview, Wisconsin.

949
01:05:15,978 --> 01:05:17,343
See you later.

950
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:19,310
What about, if you're not busy...

951
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:23,014
...a bunch of us are going,
do you want to come and be bored?

952
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:26,719
I'd love to.

953
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:31,292
- All right. See you later.
- Okay.

954
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,730
Oh, good. These need to go to Accounting.

955
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:42,462
- The loan agreements need to be notarized.
- I got it.

956
01:05:42,638 --> 01:05:46,472
- Here's the Zoning Commission reports.
- Now you can start with the appraisals...

957
01:05:46,642 --> 01:05:48,701
Actually,
I don't know how much time I have.

958
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:51,870
George sort of asked me
to go to the benefit with him tonight.

959
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:55,840
Great.

960
01:05:56,018 --> 01:05:59,681
I just have to figure out what to wear.
I don't have anything.

961
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:04,993
- "I don't have anything."
- God, she's nice.

962
01:06:09,065 --> 01:06:11,431
No, they're very good muffins.
They just need more fat.

963
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:14,228
George, sign these
or we default on five different loans.

964
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:16,098
- Take care.
- Well, hang on. Hang on.

965
01:06:16,272 --> 01:06:18,570
- I need to go over my speech.
- Sorry. I gotta run.

966
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:21,301
We'll pick you up at eight
and go through it in the car.

967
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,445
I asked June to come.
Hope that's all right.

968
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:26,672
Oh, that's dandy, but I don't need a ride.
Thanks.

969
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:35,014
- Hello, Howard.
- <i>George...</i>

970
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:37,523
<i>... I just received new estimates</i>
<i>on Island Towers.</i>

971
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:39,388
<i>Costs are skyrocketing.</i>

972
01:06:39,695 --> 01:06:42,459
<i>It will be cheaper to just knock down</i>
<i>the community center.</i>

973
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:44,064
What are you talking about?

974
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:46,326
We only got the job because we said
we'd keep it.

975
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:49,198
- <i>We said we intended to keep the center.</i>
- No wait. You can't...

976
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:51,738
This is nonsense.
You can't just decide unilaterally.

977
01:06:51,907 --> 01:06:53,204
- I'm coming over.
- <i>George.</i>

978
01:06:53,376 --> 01:06:56,834
<i>I want to take a nap before the benefit.</i>
<i>It's all very simple.</i>

979
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:59,507
Why can't we just build the towers
over the center?

980
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:01,877
<i>Because it will eat away our profits.</i>

981
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:04,542
<i>There's to be a groundbreaking ceremony</i>
<i>at Coney Island...</i>

982
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,950
<i>... with our friend Assemblyman Perez.</i>

983
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:09,614
<i>All I need</i>
<i>is one of your charming speeches.</i>

984
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:11,419
Well, you're not gonna get one.

985
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:13,058
I need you there.

986
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:16,357
- I have to consult my schedule.
- No, you won't, George. It's your job.

987
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:20,332
You're the public face of the company.
They don't want to see me.

988
01:07:20,503 --> 01:07:23,529
I can't for the life of me think why not.
You're magnificent.

989
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:27,703
Look, whatever we lose on this deal,
I'm in for half.

990
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:30,175
You'll be in for nothing
at the rate you're going.

991
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:34,612
Expensive divorces, poolside parties
at the hotel for 1000 people...

992
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:38,242
...including fireworks
and a performance by Sting.

993
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:39,945
That was one special night.

994
01:07:40,122 --> 01:07:44,058
It was Wendy the concierge's farewell bash
and a very good party if I say so myself.

995
01:07:44,827 --> 01:07:48,126
Look, I know you don't have a clue,
but the economy is not what it was.

996
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:53,999
Everything we've got, all of it, could go.

997
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:56,397
Faster than you can imagine.

998
01:07:57,373 --> 01:08:00,069
We need this built.

999
01:08:00,876 --> 01:08:03,743
You're our closer
and you will help me close this deal...

1000
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:07,405
...or I will fire you
and take all your stock options.

1001
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:10,882
And I can't bear to see you like that,
George.

1002
01:08:11,053 --> 01:08:13,954
You will help me close this deal, George,
won't you?

1003
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:18,123
I'm surprised you have to ask.

1004
01:08:18,994 --> 01:08:21,462
I wasn't really asking.

1005
01:08:23,466 --> 01:08:27,402
- You should have gone with George.
- Well, he asked June.

1006
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:31,973
- Not exclusively. He asked you too.
- He asked me too?

1007
01:08:32,141 --> 01:08:35,201
How many women should a man
take to dinner? Maybe in Utah.

1008
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:38,278
- So you're gonna go alone?
- Sure, why not?

1009
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:40,445
Hey, I think it's great.

1010
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:43,176
I was always too scared
to go anywhere alone.

1011
01:08:43,352 --> 01:08:48,221
Then I got married.
Now I'll never be alone again.

1012
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:07,833
Check out this situation.
You two kids have fun.

1013
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:09,671
All right.

1014
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:14,140
Howard. Helen, how are you?

1015
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:16,546
Mr. and Mrs. Wade, good evening.

1016
01:09:19,455 --> 01:09:20,979
- I hate these things.
- Ridiculous.

1017
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:23,523
Why can't we just give the money
and be done with it?

1018
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:25,884
Yes, that'd be fun.
Who wants a drink?

1019
01:09:26,061 --> 01:09:28,154
- I'd love some champagne.
- We don't want anything.

1020
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:30,321
- I'll have a Scotch.
- Great.

1021
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:33,525
I'll be right back
with one of the promotional bottles.

1022
01:09:36,705 --> 01:09:38,605
- Wade.
- Trump.

1023
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:42,572
- I hear Kelson finally dumped you.
- Not exactly, no.

1024
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:46,112
We came to a mutual understanding that
she couldn't bear me for another second.

1025
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:47,681
So who's the new chief counsel?

1026
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:50,546
If she's any good,
I'm gonna steal her away.

1027
01:09:51,053 --> 01:09:53,214
I doubt it. She seems quite Ioyal to me.

1028
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:55,789
- Let me be the judge of that.
- All right.

1029
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:58,324
I'm not intimidated.
I'll even lead you to her.

1030
01:09:58,494 --> 01:10:00,826
She's over there somewhere.

1031
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:10,865
Good evening.

1032
01:11:11,367 --> 01:11:13,232
Good evening.

1033
01:11:15,738 --> 01:11:17,433
Well, you look... I...

1034
01:11:17,873 --> 01:11:20,239
I... You...

1035
01:11:20,409 --> 01:11:24,243
- I can't wait to hear your speech.
- Yeah.

1036
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:27,114
No, it's just you look absolutely...

1037
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:29,681
...surprising.

1038
01:11:30,819 --> 01:11:34,687
Well, you haven't seen
the whole outfit yet.

1039
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:42,428
You see, ordinarily that would suit you
extremely well, but...

1040
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:49,729
Well, tonight you're...

1041
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:54,304
I'm just...

1042
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:00,744
- Lucy, hey.
- Hi.

1043
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:04,977
- Wow. I love your dress.
- Thank you.

1044
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:08,749
- And you look very beautiful.
- No.

1045
01:12:11,527 --> 01:12:15,691
- I'm sorry, was I interrupting something?
- No, no. We were just...

1046
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:19,533
...going over my speech.

1047
01:12:20,703 --> 01:12:23,695
Right. Work, work, work.

1048
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:26,564
Howard wants me to revise
the Island Towers proposal...

1049
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:28,835
...now that we're tearing down
the community center.

1050
01:12:29,078 --> 01:12:33,777
- I could really use your help with that.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1051
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:38,611
George, can I please talk to you
for a second?

1052
01:12:38,787 --> 01:12:42,780
Hang on. They're about to shoot a man
out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream.

1053
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:44,653
George.

1054
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:54,496
I don't care about Howard.

1055
01:12:58,573 --> 01:13:01,440
No community center. I see. Okay.

1056
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:07,514
We do give millions to charities.

1057
01:13:09,584 --> 01:13:10,676
So that justifies lying.

1058
01:13:10,852 --> 01:13:14,117
Since when is helping people
and telling the truth mutually exclusive?

1059
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:16,382
- You promised me.
- Oh, here we go.

1060
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:19,493
You said you needed me to tell you
when you were being a schmuck.

1061
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:23,119
It's frankly none of your business, is it?
You don't work here anymore!

1062
01:13:23,298 --> 01:13:26,392
I cannot believe you won't even try
to be the person you could be.

1063
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:28,160
- This is the person I could be.
- No.

1064
01:13:28,336 --> 01:13:31,362
You think you're second-rate
and there's nothing you can do.

1065
01:13:31,539 --> 01:13:35,134
And I never believed it until right now.
This minute.

1066
01:13:35,877 --> 01:13:38,937
This is the first time in a year
that I really don't like you.

1067
01:13:41,015 --> 01:13:44,644
I haven't liked me for longer than that.
And I'm not crazy about you right now.

1068
01:13:44,819 --> 01:13:47,344
Why don't you go and be the person
you're supposed to be.

1069
01:13:47,989 --> 01:13:51,015
Oh, good. I see the mature part
of the evening has begun.

1070
01:13:51,192 --> 01:13:53,422
Oh, buzz off, bozo.

1071
01:13:54,228 --> 01:13:58,096
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the ice cream is ready.</i>

1072
01:13:58,266 --> 01:14:01,133
<i>Here comes the topping.</i>

1073
01:14:10,478 --> 01:14:15,438
George, thanks again.
This was a spectacular evening.

1074
01:14:15,984 --> 01:14:19,147
I can't wait to tell my family who I met.

1075
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:21,447
Why? Who did you meet?

1076
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:23,488
You.

1077
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:29,891
- What?
- The elevator.

1078
01:14:33,034 --> 01:14:35,764
- Evening.
- Evening.

1079
01:14:43,011 --> 01:14:45,104
- How's your room, by the way?
- Amazing.

1080
01:14:45,279 --> 01:14:51,548
- But I want to pay you back with interest.
- Don't be ridiculous. I don't need interest.

1081
01:14:54,555 --> 01:14:57,023
Well, this is me.

1082
01:14:57,225 --> 01:15:00,058
So good night.

1083
01:15:00,228 --> 01:15:02,128
Yeah, good night.

1084
01:15:03,331 --> 01:15:09,167
- I had a wonderful time.
- Good. I'm very glad about that.

1085
01:15:11,773 --> 01:15:14,173
So good night.

1086
01:15:16,577 --> 01:15:18,568
Yes, good night.

1087
01:15:32,994 --> 01:15:38,432
It's all right. I own the hotel.
Your breakfast is complimentary.

1088
01:15:49,544 --> 01:15:51,205
Gorgeous.

1089
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:58,415
I know it's weird living in a hotel
but it somehow has a very homey feel.

1090
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:01,845
Would you like something
from the minibar?

1091
01:16:02,256 --> 01:16:04,224
Maybe a beer.

1092
01:16:04,459 --> 01:16:06,120
Right.

1093
01:16:15,036 --> 01:16:19,097
Wow, chess. I love chess.

1094
01:16:20,908 --> 01:16:23,103
You know what I love
even more than chess?

1095
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:26,742
Pokemon?

1096
01:16:27,815 --> 01:16:29,282
Strip chess.

1097
01:16:30,952 --> 01:16:33,614
Yes, that is a very good game.

1098
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:46,299
George?
We need to finish this conversation please...

1099
01:16:46,467 --> 01:16:49,527
- Lucy.
- Oh, June. Hi.

1100
01:16:49,704 --> 01:16:53,663
- Lucy, hi.
- Wow. Wow. Great slip.

1101
01:16:53,841 --> 01:16:57,402
- That's a great dress.
- Oh, you know, same one as before.

1102
01:16:57,578 --> 01:17:01,309
All right. Break's over.
I'm gonna capture your bish...

1103
01:17:03,718 --> 01:17:05,151
- Hi.
- Hi.

1104
01:17:13,261 --> 01:17:15,195
We were just playing a little chess.

1105
01:17:18,866 --> 01:17:20,390
And doing some laundry.

1106
01:17:20,568 --> 01:17:22,502
Oh, well, that's okay.

1107
01:17:22,670 --> 01:17:26,128
'Cause I was just about to go off
and have some sex myself.

1108
01:17:26,307 --> 01:17:28,366
I mean, not by myself...

1109
01:17:28,543 --> 01:17:33,037
...but with somebody. Somebody else.

1110
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:36,784
Oh, you don't know him.
He's in my apartment.

1111
01:17:36,951 --> 01:17:38,885
Yeah, in my bed.

1112
01:17:40,721 --> 01:17:43,087
His name is Barry. Yeah.

1113
01:17:43,257 --> 01:17:46,351
Barry in my bed. Okay, bye.

1114
01:17:50,865 --> 01:17:53,060
That was embarrassing.

1115
01:18:26,934 --> 01:18:28,458
- Hey.
- Hey.

1116
01:18:28,636 --> 01:18:31,400
- What's wrong?
- Thanks for your shoes.

1117
01:18:32,607 --> 01:18:35,337
Hold on, lady. Look at me.
What happened?

1118
01:18:35,509 --> 01:18:38,000
- Nothing.
- Something happened.

1119
01:18:38,179 --> 01:18:41,671
I've known you since Brownies,
I've never seen you cry.

1120
01:18:41,849 --> 01:18:44,374
Except when Bush won.

1121
01:18:45,186 --> 01:18:47,154
Which Bush?

1122
01:18:47,321 --> 01:18:52,554
- Both of them. So maybe you cried twice.
- This is a different George.

1123
01:18:52,727 --> 01:18:54,388
I'm sorry.

1124
01:18:54,562 --> 01:18:57,224
It's not supposed to be like this.

1125
01:18:58,399 --> 01:18:59,832
Maybe it is.

1126
01:19:01,035 --> 01:19:05,335
Maybe it's like the philosopher
Sri Yogananda says:

1127
01:19:05,506 --> 01:19:11,138
"Only that which is the other,
gives us fully unto ourselves."

1128
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:16,744
Look. I had to fight for Tom.
It was the best thing I ever did.

1129
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:17,976
Really?

1130
01:19:18,853 --> 01:19:21,151
Everything okay?

1131
01:19:21,322 --> 01:19:27,318
- Not now. Everything is not about you!
- Okay.

1132
01:19:49,350 --> 01:19:52,649
Quiet, everyone. Quiet down, please.

1133
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:54,515
Thank you.

1134
01:19:55,089 --> 01:20:00,618
I have a little poem I wrote for you, Lucy.
If you could just come up here.

1135
01:20:01,262 --> 01:20:02,889
Please.

1136
01:20:11,038 --> 01:20:13,973
- You ready for this?
- Rhyme away.

1137
01:20:16,510 --> 01:20:19,001
<i>A rolling stone gathers no moss</i>

1138
01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:20,911
<i>So</i>

1139
01:20:21,716 --> 01:20:25,618
<i>You're leaving</i>
<i>With your antacids and floss</i>

1140
01:20:25,953 --> 01:20:31,152
<i>Our hair perhaps we will toss</i>
<i>But we are at a loss</i>

1141
01:20:31,325 --> 01:20:37,286
<i>Because you are the world's best boss</i>

1142
01:20:46,474 --> 01:20:48,874
Well, that was a very nice speech
you just made...

1143
01:20:49,043 --> 01:20:55,414
...and I'm going to really miss everyone
here at Wade.

1144
01:20:57,251 --> 01:20:59,981
There are a million memories
I wouldn't trade...

1145
01:21:00,154 --> 01:21:06,559
...and if you ever get accused of murder,
you can find me at Legal Aid.

1146
01:21:11,098 --> 01:21:13,931
- What was that?
- Well, it was the same thing you just did.

1147
01:21:14,101 --> 01:21:17,730
Bye. Bye. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Nice...

1148
01:21:17,905 --> 01:21:19,065
- Bye.
- Bye.

1149
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,299
I'll really miss
all your comprehensive reports.

1150
01:21:21,475 --> 01:21:23,204
Me too. Me too.

1151
01:21:23,377 --> 01:21:26,471
Lucy. Thank you so much for everything.

1152
01:21:26,981 --> 01:21:29,279
No problem.
Well, good luck with everything.

1153
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:32,419
And I'm sorry about last night.
That was awkward.

1154
01:21:32,653 --> 01:21:37,647
- Oh, not at all. Brian was unbelievable.
- I thought it was Barry.

1155
01:21:38,826 --> 01:21:43,729
Well, Barry was first, and then
it was Brian, and it was just crowded.

1156
01:21:45,332 --> 01:21:48,028
- I almost forgot my stapler.
- Is that...? Oh, God.

1157
01:21:48,202 --> 01:21:50,136
- What?
- Never mind.

1158
01:21:50,304 --> 01:21:53,068
- No, no. What?
- Well, it's just that technically...

1159
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:57,176
...the stapler belongs to the company.
- That's right.

1160
01:21:57,344 --> 01:21:59,278
But... No, you know what? Whatever.

1161
01:21:59,447 --> 01:22:02,644
It's... The stapler just goes way back
with me. And I...

1162
01:22:02,817 --> 01:22:05,445
Well, no, no. You keep it.
It'll be our little secret.

1163
01:22:05,619 --> 01:22:07,678
- Really?
- Yeah.

1164
01:22:07,855 --> 01:22:09,880
Great, thank you. Thank you very much.

1165
01:22:10,057 --> 01:22:11,547
I guess I have kind of earned it...

1166
01:22:11,725 --> 01:22:14,489
...working here 18 hours a day,
seven days a week.

1167
01:22:14,662 --> 01:22:17,529
Wow. Guess that makes you a workaholic.

1168
01:22:17,698 --> 01:22:20,428
No, actually, those are the hours
when you work with George.

1169
01:22:21,435 --> 01:22:23,528
Well, no. I mean,
I can be a workaholic too.

1170
01:22:23,704 --> 01:22:28,368
That's why I'm vigilant about separating
my personal and professional life.

1171
01:22:28,542 --> 01:22:32,945
Really? Well, I guess that would explain
the late-night meeting in your slip.

1172
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:35,674
- I'm sorry?
- What?

1173
01:22:35,850 --> 01:22:37,875
That is absolutely none of your business.

1174
01:22:38,052 --> 01:22:39,952
My God. Fine.
How much does a stapler run?

1175
01:22:40,121 --> 01:22:41,850
Here, here's $10.

1176
01:22:42,022 --> 01:22:43,489
- Ridiculous.
- It's not your stapler.

1177
01:22:43,657 --> 01:22:45,989
What's the matter with you?
Give me my stapler.

1178
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:47,627
Look. You didn't pay for it.

1179
01:22:47,795 --> 01:22:51,891
- Give me... You have more of these!
- It's not your... Oh, my God.

1180
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:55,295
- No. No.
- All we're missing is the mud.

1181
01:22:55,469 --> 01:22:57,630
All right. Enough. Enough. Leave.

1182
01:22:57,805 --> 01:23:00,205
- She's hurting me!
- Leave, leave. Off, off.

1183
01:23:00,374 --> 01:23:02,103
In here.

1184
01:23:02,276 --> 01:23:04,335
<i>You are dead!</i>

1185
01:23:07,314 --> 01:23:10,112
- What was that?
- Your girlfriend wouldn't give me my stapler.

1186
01:23:10,284 --> 01:23:13,219
- Part of a new office supply strip search.
- Your stapler?

1187
01:23:13,387 --> 01:23:15,582
Are you still knocking down
the community center?

1188
01:23:16,524 --> 01:23:18,082
Listen.

1189
01:23:18,492 --> 01:23:22,451
- I know you're upset about last night.
- Still knocking down the community center?

1190
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:25,963
- I've been trying to call you...
- Still knocking down the community center?

1191
01:23:26,133 --> 01:23:29,728
What is wrong with you? Are you
incapable of talking about your own life?

1192
01:23:29,904 --> 01:23:31,929
Still knocking down
the community center?

1193
01:23:32,106 --> 01:23:36,406
All right. Let me remind you.
You came to the hotel.

1194
01:23:36,577 --> 01:23:39,011
I was with June.
We were unusually dressed.

1195
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:41,671
You must... You must have some feelings.

1196
01:23:48,722 --> 01:23:51,452
I don't have to listen to this.

1197
01:23:52,226 --> 01:23:55,218
You know what, where do you come off?

1198
01:23:55,462 --> 01:23:58,954
Where do you come off? Believe it or not,
I didn't take this job to sleep with you.

1199
01:23:59,133 --> 01:24:01,931
- I took this job for a cause.
- You are a cause!

1200
01:24:02,102 --> 01:24:04,195
You make Gandhi
look like a used-car salesman.

1201
01:24:04,371 --> 01:24:07,863
My God. You know what I can't believe?
How easy you are being on yourself.

1202
01:24:08,042 --> 01:24:12,479
Why don't we go over this again, okay?
You promised me a community center.

1203
01:24:12,646 --> 01:24:15,274
Yes! I promised, I promised, I promised.
I'm sorry.

1204
01:24:15,449 --> 01:24:18,077
I can't control the economy.
I can't control my brother.

1205
01:24:21,853 --> 01:24:23,184
- I think you'll find a lot of people are!
- I'm human!

1206
01:24:27,459 --> 01:24:29,791
None of us can keep up with you.
That's probably why...

1207
01:24:29,962 --> 01:24:32,192
...all those other guys bolted.

1208
01:24:34,266 --> 01:24:36,200
'Cause you're intolerable!

1209
01:24:38,270 --> 01:24:40,238
No one wants to live with a saint.
Saints are boring.

1210
01:24:50,515 --> 01:24:53,313
Mr. Wade, your brother wants to see you.

1211
01:24:55,587 --> 01:24:57,179
Right.

1212
01:25:10,502 --> 01:25:13,096
Hi, Mr. Wong?

1213
01:25:13,272 --> 01:25:17,504
Yes, Lucy Kelson.
Yeah, it's been a long time, huh?

1214
01:25:17,676 --> 01:25:19,541
I'm back at my parents' house.

1215
01:25:19,711 --> 01:25:23,807
It's kind of fun being in my old bedroom
and in the neighb...

1216
01:25:24,049 --> 01:25:29,385
Sorry. Can I have two number sixes...

1217
01:25:29,554 --> 01:25:33,490
...and a number, a number 12?

1218
01:25:33,659 --> 01:25:35,820
Yes, that's for one.

1219
01:25:35,994 --> 01:25:38,292
Always for one.

1220
01:25:38,463 --> 01:25:40,260
Yes. That's it. No.
You know what...

1221
01:25:40,432 --> 01:25:45,131
...just throw in a couple egg rolls
and that would be great.

1222
01:25:50,075 --> 01:25:56,480
For years, Coney Island has been
trying to attract this kind of development.

1223
01:25:57,716 --> 01:26:02,346
Hopefully, Island Towers
is the start of big things to come.

1224
01:26:02,521 --> 01:26:05,149
And now, it is my honor
to introduce to you...

1225
01:26:05,424 --> 01:26:10,691
...one of the men who made this
all possible, George Wade.

1226
01:26:11,596 --> 01:26:15,259
- You look great.
- Go and earn your money, George.

1227
01:26:20,472 --> 01:26:23,464
- Thanks so much.
- Great.

1228
01:26:23,642 --> 01:26:26,907
Thank you very much, Assemblyman Perez.

1229
01:26:28,647 --> 01:26:30,581
Your mom is teaching today...

1230
01:26:30,749 --> 01:26:33,718
...so we'd better grab a bite to eat
and be on our way.

1231
01:26:33,885 --> 01:26:36,945
We have some protesting to do
at the community center.

1232
01:26:37,122 --> 01:26:39,056
I'm not going.

1233
01:26:39,257 --> 01:26:41,282
- What are you talking about?
- I cannot watch...

1234
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:43,519
...another building get knocked down.

1235
01:26:43,695 --> 01:26:47,426
Hey. We didn't raise you
to sit on the sidelines.

1236
01:26:47,599 --> 01:26:50,932
Ever since you were a little girl,
you fought for what you believed in.

1237
01:26:51,103 --> 01:26:53,697
You were on the White House
Enemies list at 5.

1238
01:26:53,872 --> 01:26:56,898
Dad, I'm not sitting on the sidelines.
I'm going to work.

1239
01:26:57,075 --> 01:26:59,202
What's the point?
The man's not gonna listen to me.

1240
01:26:59,378 --> 01:27:03,075
Besides, you know, he said
some things to me that were just so...

1241
01:27:06,151 --> 01:27:07,550
True.

1242
01:27:07,953 --> 01:27:11,013
Then you change your tactics,
you change your argument.

1243
01:27:11,189 --> 01:27:12,451
You don't give up.

1244
01:27:12,624 --> 01:27:17,652
We didn't give up on civil rights
or equality for women or fair housing.

1245
01:27:18,063 --> 01:27:19,724
Honey.

1246
01:27:20,132 --> 01:27:23,829
As long as people can change,
the world can change.

1247
01:27:24,136 --> 01:27:26,661
Yeah, but what if people can't change?

1248
01:27:30,976 --> 01:27:32,603
Well...

1249
01:27:32,778 --> 01:27:34,803
...let me put it this way.

1250
01:27:35,647 --> 01:27:39,674
I'm sitting here eating a piece
of cheesecake made entirely of soy.

1251
01:27:40,051 --> 01:27:41,484
And I hate it.

1252
01:27:42,554 --> 01:27:44,613
But I'm eating it.

1253
01:27:52,230 --> 01:27:56,223
I'm going to work. Bye. Good luck.

1254
01:28:03,875 --> 01:28:05,467
The law is pretty clear on this.

1255
01:28:05,644 --> 01:28:09,102
If the landlord has not kept up
proper maintenance, he cannot evict you.

1256
01:28:09,281 --> 01:28:10,612
We will help you, Mrs. Munez.

1257
01:28:10,782 --> 01:28:14,775
Let me run and get you some forms
that you can fill out, and we'll get started.

1258
01:28:27,866 --> 01:28:29,629
Well, hello.

1259
01:28:29,901 --> 01:28:33,098
- Hi.
- You don't remember me, do you?

1260
01:28:33,271 --> 01:28:37,298
Polly St. Clair? You interviewed me?
You thought I was having a baby?

1261
01:28:37,476 --> 01:28:40,809
Oh, yes. Yes, Polly. Wow.

1262
01:28:40,979 --> 01:28:42,503
So you work here now.

1263
01:28:42,681 --> 01:28:45,912
- Terrific. How are you?
- Pregnant.

1264
01:28:46,918 --> 01:28:49,648
- I'm not falling for that one again.
- No, I'm really pregnant.

1265
01:28:49,821 --> 01:28:52,722
- You can congratulate me now.
- Polly, I was not born yesterday.

1266
01:28:52,891 --> 01:28:55,189
I'm pregnant!
You want to see the damn sonogram?

1267
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:57,294
Mrs. Munez, we have two other cases...

1268
01:28:57,462 --> 01:28:59,020
Hi.

1269
01:29:02,167 --> 01:29:04,863
Hi. I'm busy.

1270
01:29:05,437 --> 01:29:07,268
Yes.

1271
01:29:07,572 --> 01:29:10,507
I need your advice on one last thing...

1272
01:29:10,675 --> 01:29:13,109
...and then I promise
you will never hear from me again.

1273
01:29:13,278 --> 01:29:16,839
I just delivered the first speech written
entirely by myself since we met...

1274
01:29:17,015 --> 01:29:23,147
...and I think I may have blown it,
so I wanted to ask your thoughts.

1275
01:29:23,321 --> 01:29:26,290
Okay. Then I will read it to you.

1276
01:29:26,458 --> 01:29:28,949
"I'd like to welcome everyone
on this special day.

1277
01:29:29,127 --> 01:29:31,493
Island Towers will bring prestige
to the neighborhood...

1278
01:29:31,663 --> 01:29:33,494
...and become part
of Brooklyn's renaissance.

1279
01:29:33,665 --> 01:29:35,895
And we're very pleased
and proud to be here.

1280
01:29:36,067 --> 01:29:38,763
Unfortunately,
there is one fly in the ointment.

1281
01:29:38,937 --> 01:29:40,734
You see, I gave my word to someone...

1282
01:29:40,906 --> 01:29:43,875
...that we wouldn't knock down
this building behind me.

1283
01:29:44,042 --> 01:29:47,569
Normally, and those who know me
or were married to me can attest to this...

1284
01:29:47,746 --> 01:29:51,739
...my word wouldn't mean very much.
So why does it this time?

1285
01:29:51,917 --> 01:29:54,784
Well, partly because this building
is an architectural gem...

1286
01:29:54,953 --> 01:29:57,080
...and deserves to be landmarked.

1287
01:29:57,255 --> 01:30:03,091
Partly because people do need a place
to do senior's water ballet and CPR.

1288
01:30:03,261 --> 01:30:05,491
Preferably not together.

1289
01:30:06,598 --> 01:30:11,865
But mainly because this person,
despite being unusually stubborn...

1290
01:30:12,037 --> 01:30:18,442
...and unwilling to compromise
and a very poor dresser, is...

1291
01:30:19,578 --> 01:30:21,443
She's...

1292
01:30:22,547 --> 01:30:26,347
...rather like the building
she loves so much.

1293
01:30:26,518 --> 01:30:31,080
A little rough around the edges,
but when you look closely...

1294
01:30:31,990 --> 01:30:33,821
...absolutely beautiful.

1295
01:30:36,528 --> 01:30:39,224
And the only one of her kind.

1296
01:30:43,735 --> 01:30:47,432
And even though I've said cruel things
and driven her away...

1297
01:30:47,772 --> 01:30:50,104
...she's become the voice in my head.

1298
01:30:52,310 --> 01:30:55,006
And I can't seem to drown her out.

1299
01:30:58,216 --> 01:31:01,083
And I don't want to drown her out.

1300
01:31:04,923 --> 01:31:08,450
So we are going to keep
the community center.

1301
01:31:10,662 --> 01:31:13,529
Because I gave my word to her...

1302
01:31:16,267 --> 01:31:19,293
...and because we gave our word
to the community."

1303
01:31:23,141 --> 01:31:25,234
And I didn't sleep with June.

1304
01:31:26,978 --> 01:31:31,506
That's not in the speech, that's just me
letting you know that important fact.

1305
01:31:34,919 --> 01:31:36,352
What do you think?

1306
01:31:46,097 --> 01:31:48,463
I have to get back to work.

1307
01:31:57,208 --> 01:31:58,698
Right.

1308
01:31:58,910 --> 01:32:02,437
Right, yes, yes, yes. Sorry to disturb.

1309
01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:09,910
Congratulations again, Polly.

1310
01:32:36,381 --> 01:32:40,613
Aside from the split infinitive
that was somewhere in the middle...

1311
01:32:41,786 --> 01:32:44,653
...that speech was actually quite perfect,
wasn't it?

1312
01:32:44,823 --> 01:32:48,759
Yeah. I don't know what the hell
you're still doing sitting here.

1313
01:32:48,927 --> 01:32:51,293
And I don't even like him.

1314
01:33:09,981 --> 01:33:11,676
George!

1315
01:33:34,305 --> 01:33:39,106
George, I just want to say thank you.

1316
01:33:39,544 --> 01:33:42,035
Thank you and I know
I can be harsh and demanding...

1317
01:33:42,213 --> 01:33:45,307
...but I want to try and change
because I believe people can change.

1318
01:33:45,483 --> 01:33:49,579
I can change and not be so demanding
and, you know, like, meet you halfway.

1319
01:33:49,754 --> 01:33:52,814
I just... I know... Things just...

1320
01:33:54,125 --> 01:33:55,922
Once I...

1321
01:33:58,797 --> 01:33:59,957
Lucy...

1322
01:34:00,765 --> 01:34:03,131
...I am in love with you.

1323
01:34:05,770 --> 01:34:08,102
And I'm in love with you.

1324
01:34:16,114 --> 01:34:18,378
Oh, I should just mention
that I have resigned...

1325
01:34:18,883 --> 01:34:21,283
...and am now poor.
- Good.

1326
01:34:21,452 --> 01:34:25,912
When I say poor, I mean we may have to
share a helicopter with another family.

1327
01:34:26,090 --> 01:34:27,751
Does that work for you?

1328
01:34:27,926 --> 01:34:31,555
As long as I don't have to work for you,
we will be fine.

1329
01:34:31,729 --> 01:34:33,356
Excellent.

1330
01:34:34,532 --> 01:34:38,400
And now I would very much like
to discuss that whole bobcat-pretzel thing.

1331
01:34:38,670 --> 01:34:42,401
Oh, I was just kidding.
I'm allergic to bobcats, actually.

1332
01:34:42,674 --> 01:34:44,073
I'm very sorry to hear that.

1333
01:34:45,009 --> 01:34:49,241
- But I can do the pretzel.
- That's excellent news.

1334
01:35:30,922 --> 01:35:32,651
Hi, Mr. Wong, it's Lucy Kelson.

1335
01:35:32,824 --> 01:35:37,523
I need one number 13,
two number sevens...

1336
01:35:37,695 --> 01:35:40,323
I can't believe how small this apartment is.
It's shocking.

1337
01:35:40,498 --> 01:35:46,027
I need three number eights, no garlic.

1338
01:35:46,204 --> 01:35:49,139
It's good your parents went to the movies.
We'd never have squeezed in.

1339
01:35:49,307 --> 01:35:54,609
I need one number seven and...

1340
01:35:54,779 --> 01:35:57,942
I can walk from one side of this apartment
to the other in six seconds.

1341
01:35:58,116 --> 01:36:03,679
- Watch this. One...
- And a number 11, please.

1342
01:36:03,855 --> 01:36:06,346
No, actually this is for two.

1343
01:40:55,947 --> 01:40:56,936
