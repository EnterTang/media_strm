1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,074


2
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,690
有种极其寻常的错误，
It is an extremely common mistake,

3
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,984
那就是，人们认为作家的想象力是台永动机，
people think the writer's
imagination is always at work,

4
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,862
他永远可以供应
that he's constantly inventing
an endless supply

5
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:54,989
事件和篇章，
of incidents and episodes,

6
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,868
他能简简单单，凭空编出故事来。
that he simply dreams up his
stories out of thin air.

7
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,788
事实正相反。
In point of fact, the
opposite is true.

8
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,915
一旦公众知道你是作家，
Once the public knows
you're a writer,

9
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,835
他们就把角色和事件带给你
they bring the characters
and events to you

10
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:09,754
只要你擦亮双眼
and as long as you maintain
your ability to look

11
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,382
并仔细聆听，
and to carefully listen,

12
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,010
那些故事会继续...
these stories will continue to...

13
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,846
住手！住手！别！别这样！
Stop it. Stop it! Don't!
Don't do it!

14
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:27,605
会继续追寻你一生。
Will continue to seek you
out over your lifetime.

15
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:31,026
对于这样一位总是讲述他人故事的人来说，
To him who has often told
the tales of others,

16
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,902
也有许多关于他的故事可讲。
many tales will be told.

17
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,863
- 对不起。
- Sorry.
- 没事
- It's all right.

18
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,283
接下来我要在这讲述的事件
The incidents that follow
were described to me

19
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,453
和我听来时完全一样
exactly as I present them here

20
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,913
不过表达的方式将完全出人意料。
and in a wholly unexpected way.

21
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:52,756
<i>数年前，</i>
<i>A number of years ago,</i>

22
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,842
<i>轻微的“写作热”正折磨着我，</i>
<i>while suffering from a mild case
of "Scribe's Fever,"</i>

23
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:59,721
<i>那是种当时知识分子常患的精神衰弱症，</i>
<i>a form of neurasthenia common among
the intelligentsia of that time,</i>

24
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,848
<i>于是我决定将八月</i>
<i>I decided to spend
the month of August</i>

25
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:05,894
<i>花在苏丹特瓦茨山下，那不勒堡的温泉镇里，</i>
<i>in the spa town of Nebelsbad
below the Alpine Sudetenwaltz,</i>

26
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,564
<i>并在布达佩斯大饭店住下，</i>
<i>and had taken up rooms
in the Grand Budapest,</i>

27
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:14,611
<i>住在那座如画般壮观、一度广为人知的建筑里。</i>
<i>a picturesque, elaborate, and once
widely celebrated establishment.</i>

28
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,405
<i>我想你们之中有人会知道。</i>
<i>I expect some of you will know it.</i>

29
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,410
<i>时值淡季，大饭店又过了时，</i>
<i>It was off season and, by that time,
decidedly out of fashion,</i>

30
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,537
<i>已经开始衰落，</i>
<i>and it had already begun its descent</i>

31
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:28,667
<i>不断破败，直至损毁。</i>
<i>into shabbiness and
eventual demolition.</i>

32
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,585
<i>我们寥寥数位客人，</i>
<i>What few guests we were</i>

33
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:33,046
<i>一眼就能认出对方</i>
<i>had quickly come to recognize
one another by sight</i>

34
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:37,509
<i>是在这宽广住所内居住的仅剩的生灵，</i>
<i>as the only living souls residing
in the vast establishment,</i>

35
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:40,679
<i>尽管我不相信我们之间的了解，</i>
<i>although I do not believe any acquaintance
among our number had proceeded</i>

36
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,723
<i>超过了那些礼貌的点头，</i>
<i>beyond the polite nods
we exchanged as we passed</i>

37
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:44,808
<i>于廷廊，</i>
<i>in the Palm Court,</i>

38
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,851
<i>于阿拉伯浴场，</i>
<i>in the Arabian baths,</i>

39
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,354
<i>于石柱索道上擦肩而过。</i>
<i>and onboard the Colonnade Funicular.</i>

40
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:52,440
<i>看起来，我们都很矜持，</i>
<i>We were a very reserved
group, it seemed,</i>

41
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,943
<i>而且，无一例外地，孤独。</i>
<i>and, without exception, solitary.</i>

42
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:02,033
<i>也许正是因为这一致的静默，</i>
<i>Perhaps as a result of
this general silence,</i>

43
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,036
<i>我与饭店的门房，一位西欧人，</i>
<i>I had established a casual
and bantering familiarity</i>

44
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,414
<i>随意地熟络起来，一起说笑，</i>
<i>with the hotel's concierge,
a West-continental</i>

45
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,582
<i>他叫简</i>先生，
<i>known only as </i>Monsieur <i>Jean,</i>

46
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:14,838
<i>一上来又懒散，又真的十分通情达理，让我印象深刻。</i>
<i>who struck one as being, at once, both
lazy and, really, quite accommodating.</i>

47
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,424
<i>我猜他薪水不高。</i>
<i>I expect he was not well paid.</i>

48
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:18,883
<i>不管怎样，某个夜晚，</i>
<i>In any case, one evening,</i>

49
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,636
<i>当我一如往常，和简</i>先生<i>手肘相贴，站着交谈时，</i>
<i>as I stood conferring elbow-to-elbow
with </i>Monsieur <i>Jean,</i>

50
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:26,057
<i>我发现一位新来客。</i>
<i>as had become my habit, I noticed
a new presence in our company.</i>

51
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,727
<i>一位身躯矮小，衣着入时的老者，</i>
<i>A small, elderly man,
smartly dressed,</i>

52
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,813
<i>生着张出奇地有神又聪慧的脸庞，</i>
<i>with an exceptionally lively,
intelligent face</i>

53
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:35,025
<i>带着易于觉察的忧伤。</i>
<i>and an immediately perceptible
air of sadness.</i>

54
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,695
<i>他和我们一样，独身一人，但我不得不说，</i>
<i>He was, like the rest of us, alone,
but also, I must say,</i>

55
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:43,491
<i>他是第一个，因为深沉而真挚的孤独，
而让我印象深刻的人。</i>
<i>he was the first that struck one
as being deeply and truly lonely.</i>

56
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,411
<i>他和我的病症一样。</i>
<i>A symptom
of my own medical condition as well.</i>

57
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,496
这位有趣的老家伙是谁呀？
Who's this interesting old fellow?

58
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,081
<i>我问简</i>先生。
<i>I inquired of </i>Monsieur <i>Jean.</i>

59
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,959
<i>令我吃惊的是，简</i>先生<i>很是惊讶。</i>
<i>To my surprise,
he was distinctly taken aback.</i>

60
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,544
- 你不知道？<i>
- 他问。</i>
- Don't you know?<i>
- He asked.</i>

61
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,504
你认不出他吗？
Don't you recognize him?

62
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:57,964
<i>他确实有些眼熟。</i>
<i>He did look familiar.</i>

63
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,885
这是穆斯塔法先生。
他一清早到的。
That's Mr. Moustafa himself.
He arrived earlier this morning.

64
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,471
<i>你们中的旺季常客，</i>
<i>This name will no doubt be familiar</i>

65
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,140
<i>自然熟知这个名字。</i>
<i>to the more seasoned
persons among you.</i>

66
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:13,897
<i>零.穆斯塔法先生一度是朱波罗卡的首富，</i>
<i>Mr. Zero Moustafa was at one time
the richest man in Zubrowka,</i>

67
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,985
<i>而且仍是布达佩斯大饭店的主人。</i>
<i>and was still indeed the owner
of the Grand Budapest.</i>

68
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,530
他经常在此逗留一个星期，有时多几天，
He often comes and
stays a week or more,

69
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,741
一年至少来三次，但从不在这个季节来。
three times a year at least,
but never in the season.

70
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,202
<i>简</i>先生<i>示意我俯下身。</i>
Monsieur <i>Jean signaled to me
and I leaned closer.</i>

71
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,620
告诉你个秘密。
I'll tell you a secret.

72
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,039
他只住在没有浴室的单床间，
He takes only a single-bed
sleeping room without a bath

73
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,999
就在顶层的后角，
in the rear corner of the top floor

74
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,085
比货梯还小！
and it's smaller than
the service elevator!

75
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,753
<i>众所周知，</i>
<i>It was well known,</i>

76
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,547
<i>零.穆斯塔法购买了几座</i>
<i>Zero Moustafa had purchased
and famously inhabited</i>

77
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,634
<i>欧洲大陆最为奢华的城堡和宫府，居住其内，以此为名。</i>
<i>some of the most lavish castles
and palazzos on the continent.</i>

78
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:46,054
<i>但是，在这里，在他自己近乎空旷的饭店里，</i>
<i>Yet here, in his own
nearly empty hotel,</i>

79
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,973
<i>他就住在一个仆人的单间里？</i>
<i>he occupied a servant's quarters?</i>

80
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:52,185
<i>那时，一场附加的室内剧拉开了帷幕...</i>
<i>At that moment, the curtain rose
on a parenthetical, domestic drama...</i>

81
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,687
该死
Shit.

82
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,773
<i>它立刻，完全地吸引了</i>
<i>which required the immediate
and complete attention</i>

83
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,942
<i>简</i>先生<i>的注意，</i>
<i>of </i>Monsieur <i>Jean,</i>

84
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,071
<i>但，说实话，我没怎么留意。</i>
<i>but, frankly, did not
hold mine for long.</i>

85
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,538
<i>然而，</i>
<i>However,</i>

86
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,225
<i>这位奇妙老人的故事过早地被打断，</i>
<i>this premature intermission
in the story of the curious, old man</i>

87
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,876
<i>这让我，正如德国俗话所说，</i>
<i>had left me, as the expression goes,</i>

88
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,129
"心有不甘，"
"gespannt wie ein Flitzebogen,"

89
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,798
<i>也就是说，我坐在凳子的边沿上，</i>
<i>that is, on the edge of my seat,</i>

90
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,843
<i>直到转天早上，</i>
<i>where I remained throughout
the next morning, until,</i>

91
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,805
<i>直到我发觉了命运用着神秘而完全可靠的方式，</i>
<i>in what I have found to be its
mysterious and utterly reliable fashion,</i>

92
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:32,892
<i>再一次地，闯入了我的生活。</i>
<i>fate, once again,
intervened on my behalf.</i>

93
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,815
我欣赏你的作品。
I admire your work.

94
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,528
您说什么？
I beg your pardon?

95
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:49,200
我说，我了解并欣赏你绝妙的作品。
I said, I know and admire
your wonderful work.

96
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,078
衷心感谢您，先生。
Thank you most kindly, sir.

97
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,622
简<i>先生</i>有没有或多或少和你讲过
Did <i>Monsieur </i>Jean have a word or two
to share with you

98
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:58,293
这座建筑那年迈的主人？
about the aged proprietor
of this establishment?

99
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:03,048
我必须承认，我确实问了关于你的事。
I must confess, I did
myself inquire about you.

100
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,884
简<i>先生</i>无疑很能干，
He's perfectly capable,
of course,<i> Monsieur </i>Jean

101
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,844
但他称不上一流，
but we can't claim he's a first,

102
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,722
或者诚恳点讲，他甚至算不上是二流的门房。
or, in earnest, even
second-rate concierge.

103
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,015
但事情就是这样。
But there it is.

104
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,768
时代变了。
Times have changed.

105
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:20,982
这儿的温泉浴室很漂亮。
The thermal baths
are very beautiful.

106
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,527
它们和刚建造时一样。
当然，也没法进行修缮。
They were in their first condition.
It couldn't be maintained, of course.

107
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,279
放在当下，有些太颓废派了。
Too decadent for current tastes.

108
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:31,201
但我还是一样爱这堆迷人的废墟。
But I love it all just the same,
this enchanting old ruin.

109
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,913
冒昧问一句，你为什么要买下它呢？
How did you come to
buy it, if I may ask?

110
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,082
买布达佩斯大饭店。
The Grand Budapest.

111
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:47,884
我没买。
I didn't.

112
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,270
如果你不仅仅是出于礼貌问我，
If you're not merely being polite,

113
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,232
当然如果是的话请一定要告诉我，
and you must tell me
if that's the case,

114
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:05,360
不过如果你真的感兴趣的话，
but if it genuinely
does interest you,

115
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,987
我能邀请你今晚和我共进晚餐吗？
may I invite you to
dine with me tonight,

116
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:11,991
我会非常乐意，事实上这是我的荣幸，
and it will be my pleasure and,
indeed, my privilege to tell you

117
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,704
来为你讲述“我的故事”。虽然这故事不怎么样。
"my story." Such as it is.

118
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,837
两只橄榄烤鸭。
Two ducks roasted with olives.

119
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,297
兔肉，沙拉？
Rabbit, salad?

120
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,259
52年的普伊-儒微，再把干葡萄酒倒一点给我。
Pouilly-Jouvet '52, plus
a split of the brut.

121
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,722
这样时间应该足够了
That should provide us ample time

122
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,141
- 如果我立刻开始讲的话。
- 请务必开始吧。
- if I commence promptly.
- By all means.

123
00:08:56,036 --> 00:09:01,416
好吧，这故事必须，以我们共同朋友的前辈开头。
Well, it begins, as it must, with
our mutual friend's predecessor.

124

布达佩斯大饭店深受爱戴的第一代门房。
The beloved, original concierge
of The Grand Budapest.

125
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,340
这故事当然是这样开头的...
It begins, of course, with...

126
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,978
- 把桌子搬到窗户边。
- 好的，古斯塔夫<i>先生</i>。
- Bring the table to the window.

127
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,513
- 把餐盘端到桌子那去。
- 这就去，古斯塔夫<i>先生</i>。
- Bring the tray to the table.
- Right away, <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave.

128
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,078
就放那。
那些刷过了吗？定过型了吗？
Right there.
Have those been brushed and blocked?

129
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,080
- 当然，古斯塔夫<i>先生</i>。
- 把它们装进帽盒里。
- Of course, <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave.
- Pack them in the hat boxes.

130
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,374
- 那是奥伯斯多夫公司的吗？
- 我认为是的，古斯塔夫<i>先生</i>。
- Is that from Oberstdorf & Company?
- I believe so, <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave.

131
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,292
-第二个箱子。谁拿着票呢？
- 在我这，古斯塔夫<i>先生</i>。
- Second trunk. Who has the tickets?
- I do, <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave.

132
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,378
把票给我。
Give them to me.

133
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,714
这些没问题。
在角落等着。
These are in order.
Wait in the corner.

134
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,183
- 我不走了。
- 您说什么？
- I'm not leaving.
- I beg your pardon?

135
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,352
- 我不走了。
- 为什么？
- I'm not leaving.
- Why not?

136
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,479
- 我害怕。
- 怕什么？
- I'm frightened.
- Of what?

137
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,014
我怕这是最后一次见你了。
I fear this may be the last time
we ever see each other.

138
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,733
这怎么可能？
Why on earth would that be the case?

139
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,069
我说不出来，但我就是这么感觉的。
Well, I can't put it into
words, but I feel it.

140
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,917
天哪，你没什么理由离开我们的...
For goodness sake, there's no reason
for you to leave us if you'd...

141
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,075
- 和我走吧。
- 去那个破路兹？
- Come with me.
- To fucking Lutz?

142
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,327
- 求你了。
- 把手给我。
- Please.
- Give me your hand.

143
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,374
没什么好怕的。每次行前你总是焦虑。
You've nothing to fear. You're always
anxious before you travel.

144
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,377
我承认，这次你看起来明显更不舒服。
I admit, you appear to be suffering
a more acute attack on this occasion.

145
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,422
但是，说真的...哦天啊。
你对你的指甲做了什么？
But, truly and honestly... Oh, dear God.
What have you done to your fingernails?

146
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,382
- 你说什么？
- 这天杀的指甲油。
- I beg your pardon?
- This diabolical varnish.

147
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,465
- 这颜色太难看了。
- 你不喜欢？
- The color is completely wrong.
- Don't you like it?

148
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:37,429
我不是不喜欢。
我都生理不适了。
It's not that I don't like it.
I am physically repulsed.

149
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,891
- 也许这会让你舒服点。
- 什么？别背诗。
- Perhaps this will soothe you.
- What? Don't recite.

150
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,310
- 听听吧。嘘。
- 求你了，别现在背。
- Just listen to the words. Hush.
- Please. Not now.

151
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:48,356
"我于这片古老高贵又灰暗的松林中求索，
"While questing once in noble wood
of gray, medieval pine,

152
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:52,861
"行至那被雨露打湿，清凉，飘渺的坟前，
"I came upon a tomb,
rain-slick'd, rubbed-cool, ethereal,

melancholy fissures..."

155
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,035
能为我亮一只蜡烛吗？
Will you light a
candle for me, please?

156
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,956
- 在圣母教堂的圣器室里？
- 我马上就亲自去。
- In the sacristy of Santa Maria?
- I'll see to it myself immediately.

157
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,085
记住，我一直与你同在。
Remember, I'm always with you.

158
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,839
- 我爱你。
- 我爱你。
- I love you.
- I love you.

159
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,895
能像那样赢得一位女士的芳心很了不起，
It's quite a thing winning
the loyalty of a woman like that

160
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:29,064
何况还是连续19年。
for 19 consecutive seasons.

161
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:33,151
- 是的，先生。
- 你知道，她非常喜爱我。
- Yes, sir.
- She's very fond of me, you know.

162
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,319
是的，先生。
Yes, sir.

163
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,404
但我从没见过她那样。
But I've never seen
her like that before.

164
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:37,572
是的，先生。
No, sir.

165
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,158
她抖得像只在大便的狗。
She was shaking like a shitting dog.

166
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:42,494
是啊。
Truly.

167
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,163
跑去布鲁克帕兹的圣母教堂
Run to the cathedral of Santa Maria
in Brucknerplatz.

168
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,998
买支朴素的半截蜡烛

half-length candles

Klubecks in change.

在圣堂点亮蜡烛，念一段简短的玫瑰经

then go to Mendl's
and get me a <i>courtesan au chocolat.</i>

172

如果还有钱剩下，赏给瘸腿的擦鞋童。
If there's any money left, give it
to the crippled shoe-shine boy.

173
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,552
- 这就去，先生。
- 等一下。
- Right away, sir.
- Hold it.

174

- 你是谁？
- 我叫零，先生。我是新来的门童。
- Who are you?
- I'm Zero, sir. The new Lobby Boy.

175
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,018

- 是的，先生。
- Zero, you say?
- Yes, sir.

176
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:09,582
我没听过你，也没见过你。谁雇的你？
I've never heard of you, never laid
eyes on you. Who hired you?

177
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:12,148
- 是莫舍先生，先生。
- 莫舍先生！
- Mr. Mosher, sir.
- Mr. Mosher!

178
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,442
怎么了，古斯塔夫<i>先生</i>？
Yes, <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave?

179
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,278
我是不是可以理解为，你偷偷地雇佣了这位年轻人
Am I to understand you've
surreptitiously hired this young man

180
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,613
做门童？
in the position of a Lobby Boy?

181
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:22,409
他还在试用期内，当然要等您同意才能雇佣。
He's been engaged for a trial period,
pending your approval, of course.

182
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,329

You're most welcome,

00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,626
你现在要接受正式面试。
You're now going to be
officially interviewed.

185
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,087
我是不是该先去点蜡烛，先生？
Should I go and light
the candle first, sir?

186
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,505
什么？不是。
What? No.

187
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,343

- Thank you again, <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave.
- Straighten that cap, Anatole.

- 我很荣幸，施耐德<i>先生。</i>
- 帽带断了。
- The pleasure's mine, <i>Herr </i>Schneider.

00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,149
- 这可不行。
- 我完全同意。

- What in hell is this?
- Not now.

200
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,331

00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,544
零。
Zero.

六楼，伊格。

203
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,139
你为什么想当门童？
Why do you want to be a Lobby Boy?

204
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:32,520
唔，谁不愿意在布达佩斯大饭店当门童呢，先生？
Well, who wouldn't,
at the Grand Budapest, sir?

205
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,689
这名气很大。
It's an institution.

206
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,235
很好。
Very good.

207

208
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,632
你曾经是门童吗，先生？
Were you ever a Lobby Boy, sir?

209
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,050
你觉得呢？
What do you think?

210
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:04,135
唔，我想你总要从某个地方开始的...
Well, I suppose you'd have
to start somewhere...

211
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,103
- 去把破蜡烛点上。
- 好的，先生。
- Go and light the goddamn candle.
- Yes, sir.

212
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,228
<i>就这样，我的人生开始了。</i>
<i>And so, my life began.</i>

213
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,315
<i>培训中的初级门童，</i>
<i>Junior Lobby Boy in-training,</i>

214
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,025
<i>在布达佩斯大饭店，</i>
<i>Grand Budapest Hotel,</i>

215
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:22,320
<i>古斯塔夫</i>先生<i>严格的要求下进行。</i>
<i>under the strict command
of </i>Monsieur <i>Gustave H.</i>

216
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:25,573
<i>我是他的小学生，他是我的导师和守护者。</i>
<i>I became his pupil, and he was
to be my counselor and guardian.</i>

217
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,492
<i>什么是门童？</i>
<i>What is a Lobby Boy?</i>

218
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:31,204
<i>门童要做到完全隐形，又无处不在。</i>
<i>A Lobby Boy's completely
invisible, yet always in sight.</i>

219
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:33,415
<i>门童要记得客人的忌讳。</i>
<i>A Lobby Boy remembers
what people hate.</i>

220
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,417
<i>门童要料见客人的需求，</i>
<i>A Lobby Boy anticipates
the client's needs</i>

221
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,669
<i>要早于他们提出需求前。
<i>before the needs are needed.</i>

222
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:41,089
<i>门童，首先，要小心翼翼，不能犯错。</i>
<i>A Lobby Boy is, above all,
discreet to a fault.</i>

223
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,299
我们的客人知道他们心底的有些秘密，
Our guests know their
deepest secrets,

224
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,010
老实说，不如说是见不得人的秘密，
some of which are, frankly,
rather unseemly,

225
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:46,761
会被我们带到土里。
will go with us to our graves.

226
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:49,639
- 所以把嘴闭紧了，零。
- 好的，先生。
- So keep your mouth shut, Zero.
- Yes, sir.

227
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,727
目前就这些。
That's all for now.

228
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,021
<i>我开始觉察到，</i>
<i>I began to realize that
many of the hotel's</i>

229
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:59,774
<i>饭店里最有钱、最尊贵的客人们，是为他而来。</i>
<i>most valued and distinguished guests
came for him.</i>

230
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:03,028
<i>这看起来是他职责中重要的一环，</i>
<i>It seemed to be an essential part
of his duties,</i>

231
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,447
<i>但我相信他也乐在其中。</i>
<i>but I believe it was
also his pleasure.</i>

232
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,451
<i>筛选她们的标准总是相同。</i>
<i>The requirements were
always the same.</i>

233
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,203
<i>她们都必须富有，</i>
<i>They had to be rich,</i>

234
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,455
<i>年老，</i>
<i>old,</i>

235
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,748
<i>没有安全感，</i>
<i>insecure,</i>

236
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,166
<i>虚荣，</i>
<i>vain,</i>

237
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,500
<i>肤浅，</i>
<i>superficial,</i>

238
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:18,752
<i>金发，</i>
<i>blonde,</i>

239
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,545
<i>欲求不满。</i>
<i>needy.</i>

240
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,673
为什么选金发？
Why blonde?

241
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,218
因为她们就都是金发的。
Because they all were.

242
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:28,720
<i>顺便说一句，</i>
<i>He was, by the way,</i>

243
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:32,515
<i>他是我遇见过的人里，香水喷得最多的一位。</i>
<i>the most liberally perfumed man
I had ever encountered.</i>

244
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,560
<i>未见其人，先闻其香，</i>
<i>The scent announced his approach
from a great distance</i>

245
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,731
<i>且绕梁三日不绝。</i>
<i>and lingered for many minutes
after he was gone.</i>

246
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,486
<i>我一周工作六天，周日也有半天工作，</i>
<i>I worked six days each week
plus a half-day Sunday,</i>

247
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,863
<i>从早上五点，做到午夜。</i>
<i>5:00 AM until just after midnight.</i>

248
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:50,617
<i>为了保持体力，我们少食多餐。</i>
<i>Our meals were small but frequent,
for stamina.</i>

249
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,661
<i>两顿早餐，两顿午餐，晚餐吃得迟。</i>
<i>Two breakfasts, two lunches
and a late supper.</i>

250
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:58,208
<i>古斯塔夫</i>先生<i>还在晚间布道。</i>
Monsieur <i>Gustave also delivered
a nightly sermon.</i>

251
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,419
粗鲁仅仅表达了恐惧。
Rudeness is merely the
expression of fear.

252
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,755
人们恐惧无法得到所想。
People fear they won't
get what they want.

253
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,550
只要最为可怕、不讨人喜爱的人被爱，
The most dreadful and unattractive
person only needs to be loved,

254
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:10,220
他们便会像花儿般绽放。
and they will open
up like a flower.

255
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:11,846
我想起了一段诗，
I am reminded of a verse,

256
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,557
"绘者的画刷轻触稚嫩脸庞，
"The painter's brush touched
the inchoate face

257
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,685
"用灵巧刷毛的末端，
"by ends of nimble bristles

258
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:20,772
"初画一笔，色彩便使了无生气的双颊，有了盎然朝气。"
"and with their blush of first color,
rendered her lifeless cheek living."

259
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:24,192
<i>而他，则在自己的房间独自吃饭。</i>
<i>His own dinner, he took
alone in his room.</i>

260
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:33,493
<i>我们并不知道大饭店主人的身份。</i>
<i>The identity of the owner of the
hotel was unknown to all of us.</i>

261
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,497
<i>他的秘史，副手卡瓦斯，每个月都会来，</i>
<i>Each month, his emissary,
known as Deputy Kovacs, arrived</i>

262
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,541
<i>检阅账本，传达信息，</i>
<i>to review the books
and convey messages</i>

263
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,293
<i>代表那位神秘的主人。</i>
<i>on behalf of the
mysterious proprietor.</i>

264
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,422
<i>这些时候，古斯塔夫</i>先生<i>和我们的商务经理，</i>
<i>On these occasions, </i>Monsieur <i>Gustave
and our business manager,</i>

265
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:50,218
<i>贝克</i>先生，<i>都会与卡瓦斯在接待处秘密磋商。</i>
Herr <i>Becker, met with him in private
consultation above Reception.</i>

266
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,441
<i>也是那时，我遇见了阿加莎，</i>
<i>This was also when I met Agatha,</i>

267
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,586
<i>但现在我们不提这个。</i>
<i>but we won't discuss that.</i>

268
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:16,552
- 干嘛？
- 看。
- What do you want?
- Look.

269
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,003
哪里会有战争？
坦克开至边境

270
00:18:20,221 --> 00:18:21,550
伯爵贵妇死于闺房

271
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,727
天啊。
Dear God.

272
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,312
我很遗憾，先生。
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

273
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:26,481
- 我们必须去看她。
- 我们必须去吗？
- We must go to her.
- We must?

274
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:30,276
<i>马上去。</i>她需要我，而我需要你帮我收拾行李等等。
<i>Tout de suite. </i>She needs me, and I need
you to help me with my bags and so on.

275
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:33,822
- 你多快能收拾好？
- 五分钟。
- How fast can you pack?
- Five minutes.

276
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,988
去吧。再带上瓶26年的普伊-儒微，
Do it. And bring a bottle
of the Pouilly-Jouvet '26

277
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,367
装进冰桶，再带两个杯子，
in an ice bucket with two glasses

278
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,412
这样我们就不用喝餐车里像猫尿的玩意了。
so we don't have to drink the cat
piss they serve in the dining car.

279
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,548
我责备自己。
I blame myself.

280
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:55,635
她试着告诉我她有坏预感。可我没听。
She tried to tell me she had
a premonition. I didn't listen.

281
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,429
路兹人都会穿上黑衣，
All of Lutz will be
dressed in black,

282
00:18:57,512 --> 00:18:59,514
除了她那可怕的、虚伪的孩子们，
except her own ghastly,
deceitful children

283
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,725
她对他们的憎恶，让她连见面吻都受不了。
whom she loathed
and couldn't bear to kiss hello.

284
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:04,310
他们肯定跳得和吉普赛人一样开心。
They'll be dancing like gypsies.

285
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,399
人生全无意义，
There's really no point
in doing anything in life,

286
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,401
因为一刹那间就已经完结...
because it's all over in
the blink of an eye...

287
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,446
而且接下来，如你所知，尸斑蓬勃生长。
And, the next thing you know,
rigor mortis sets in.

288
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:17,490
唉，好人不长命。
Oh, how the good die young.

289
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,618
有幸的话，她会给你的老朋友留几个钱，
With any luck, she's left
a few Klubecks for your old friend,

290
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:23,997
但只有到了死亡证明落实了才知道。
but one never knows until the ink
is dry on the death certificate.

291
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:27,459
顺便说一句，她床上功夫不错。
She was dynamite in
the sack, by the way.

292
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,755
古斯塔夫<i>先生</i>，她都84岁了。
She was 84, <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave.

293
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,506
我和更老的也干过。
I've had older.

294
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,342
你年轻时，身边全是菲力牛排，
When you're young,
it's all fillet steak,

295
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,511
但是年华老去，你就得去寻找谢便宜货，
but as the years go by, you have to
move on to the cheaper cuts,

296
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,889
不过我可以接受，因为我喜欢。
which is fine with me,
because I like those.

297
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:43,475
更加多汁可口，他们这么说。
More flavorful, or so they say.

298
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,772
为什么车要在麦地停下？
Why are we stopping
at a barley field?

299
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,705
唔，你们好啊，小伙子。
Well, hello there, chaps.

300
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,415
请出示证件。
Documents, please.

301
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:09,584
乐意之至。
With pleasure.

302
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,548
恐怕相片拍得没有真人好看。
It's not a very flattering
portrait, I'm afraid.

303
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,425
我曾经可是大美男。
I was once considered
a great beauty.

304
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:20,929
你名字的F代表什么？弗瑞兹？弗兰兹？
What does the "F" stand for?
Fritz? Franz?

305
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,807
- 弗兰兹。
- 我就知道！
- Franz.
- I knew it!

306
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,018
他在做鬼脸呢。
He's making a funny face.

307
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:30,814
亲爱的弗兰兹，那是个三阶工人身份的移民签证。
That's a Migratory Visa with Stage
Three Worker Status, Franz, darling.

308
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,066
他是和我一起的。
He's with me.

309
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:34,984
请出来一下。
Come outside, please.

310
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,531
等一下。坐下，零。他的证件是合乎程序的。
Now, wait a minute. Sit down, Zero.
His papers are in order.

311
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:42,701
我亲自和劳役局对照过了。
I cross-referenced them myself with
the Bureau of Labor and Servitude.

312
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,744
你不能因为他是移民就逮捕他。
You can't arrest him simply because
he's a bloody immigrant.

313
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:46,955
他没做错什么。
He hasn't done anything wrong.

314
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,587
该死的，住手！
Stop it, damn you!

315
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:56,881
没事的，古斯塔夫<i>先生</i>！不用拦着他们！
Never mind, <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave!
Let them proceed!

316
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:58,717
嗷！好疼啊！
Ow! That hurts!

317
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,431
你们这些肮脏的，该死的，满脸麻子的法西斯混蛋！
You filthy, goddamn,
pock-marked, fascist assholes!

318
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,850
把你的手从我的门童身上拿开！
Take your hands off my Lobby Boy!

319
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:19,988
出什么事儿了？
What's the problem?

320
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:21,406
这太离谱了。
This is outrageous.

321
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:24,170
这个年轻人在那不勒堡的布达佩斯大饭店为我工作。
The young man works for me at the
Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad.

322
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:27,495
古斯塔夫<i>先生</i>？
<i>Monsieur </i>Gustave?

323
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:32,167
我是汉克斯。
My name is Henckels.

324
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,671
我是父母是沃夫冈.汉克斯.伯格多夫夫妇。
I'm the son of Dr. and Mrs. Wolfgang
Henckels-Bergersdofer.

325
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,631
你还记得我吗？
Do you remember me?

326
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:43,178
记得一清二楚。太巧了。你是小艾伯特。
I know exactly who you are.
It's uncanny. You're little Albert.

327
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:45,180
这实在太尴尬了。放开他们。
I'm terribly embarrassed.
Release them.

328
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:48,141
放开他们。
Release them.

329
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:56,232
你的同事没有国籍。
Your colleague is stateless.

330
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,849
他需要申请一个新版特别转移许可，
He'll need to apply for a
revised Special Transit Permit,

331
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:02,197
但现在很难获得。
which at this point
may be very difficult to acquire.

332
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,531
拿着这个。
Take this.

333
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:07,952
这是个临时证，但我恐怕只能给你这个了。
It's temporary but it's the
best I can offer, I'm afraid.

334
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:10,163
令堂怎么样？
And how's your wonderful mother?

335
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,457
- 她很好，谢谢。
- 我仰慕她。
- She's very well, thank you.
- I adore her.

336
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,793
- 代我问好。
- 我会的。
- Send my love.
- I will.

337
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:19,589
在我还是个孤独的小男孩时，你的同伴对我非常友善。
Your companion was very kind to me
when I was a lonely little boy.

338
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:22,967
我和我的手下为打扰你而道歉。
My men and I apologize
for disturbing you.

339
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:25,178
请您原谅，先生。
I beg your pardon, sir.

340
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:44,823
看见了吗？微弱的文明之光
You see? There are still
faint glimmers of civilization

341
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:48,743
仍存留在这野蛮的屠场里，这就是人性。
left in this barbaric slaughterhouse
that was once known as humanity.

342
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:53,164
这确实就是我们这些谦逊，卑微，渺小的人可以提供的...
Indeed, that's what we provide in our
own modest, humble, insignificant...

343
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:56,751
唉，去他的。
Oh, fuck it.

344
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:30,869
克罗蒂德，她在哪？带我过去。
Where is she, Clotilde?
Take me to her.

345
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:08,323
你看起来真好，亲爱的。真的很好。
You're looking so well, darling.
You really are.

346
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:09,949
入殓师做的很棒。
They've done a marvelous job.

347
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:12,660
我不知道他们在太平间给你擦了什么乳霜，
I don't know what sort of cream they've
put on you down at the morgue,

348
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:14,079
我都想要点了。
but I want some.

349
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:16,664
说实话，你比这几年看起来都好。
Honestly, you look better
than you have in years.

350
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,792
你看起来像个活人。
You look like you're alive.

351
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:28,218
哎呀，你最后还是把颜色换了。完美。
Oh, you changed it after all.
It's perfect.

352
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:30,220
- 克罗蒂德？<i>
- 怎么了，古斯塔夫</i>先生？
- Clotilde?<i>
- Oui, Monsieur </i>Gustave?

353
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:32,389
请给我来一杯无冰凉水。
A glass of chilled water
with no ice, please.

354
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:38,000
好的，古斯塔夫<i>先生</i>。另外，
瑟奇先生想让您自己去他办公室，他有话和您说。

355
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:41,356
那好吧。
All right, then.

356
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:43,733
亲爱的，我不会去很久的。
I shan't be long, darling.

357
00:24:44,943 --> 00:24:46,986
<i>我们被护送着，穿过绿呢门，</i>
<i>We were escorted through
a green baize door,</i>

358
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:50,407
<i>走下窄窄的服务走廊，进入管家的厨房。</i>
<i>down a narrow service corridor
and into the butler's pantry.</i>

359
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:55,412
<i>过了一会儿，厨房门被转开，</i>
<i>A moment later, the kitchen
passage swung open</i>

360
00:24:55,704 --> 00:24:58,957
<i>一位身着白衣的矮小仆从突然进了屋。</i>
<i>and a small servant dressed in white
jolted into the room.</i>

361
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:02,085
<i>我永远也忘不了他的表情。</i>
<i>I've never forgotten
the look on that man's face.</i>

362
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:04,963
这究竟出什么事儿了？
What the devil is going on?

363
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:09,259
<i>我自己，一生中，从未踏足这样人家的房子。</i>
<i>I, myself, had never set foot inside
a house of this kind in my life.</i>

364
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:13,242
<i>我对接下来会发生什么知之甚少。</i>
<i>I understood very little about
the events that were to follow.</i>

365
00:25:13,388 --> 00:25:16,349
<i>但最后，我意识到，</i>
<i>But, eventually,
I came to recognize,</i>

366
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:20,145
<i>当一大笔财产的去处悬而未决，</i>
<i>when the destiny of a great fortune
is at stake,</i>

367
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:24,232
<i>人类的贪婪，和血管里的毒药，扩散得一样快。</i>
<i>men's greed spreads like a poison
in the bloodstream.</i>

368
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,696
<i>叔叔，侄子，表亲，</i>
<i>Uncles, nephews, cousins,</i>

369
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:32,365
<i>夫家的远房姻亲。</i>
<i>in-laws of increasingly
tenuous connection.</i>

370
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:34,221
<i>老妇亲缘关系最远的亲戚，</i>
<i>The old woman's most
distant relations</i>

371
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:36,411
<i>都来分这大房子的一杯羹。</i>
<i>had come foraging out
of the woodwork.</i>

372
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:42,250
<i>在这集会的最前头，有个令人困惑的巧合，</i>
<i>At the head of this congregation,
it was a disorienting coincidence,</i>

373
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:45,170
<i>我们发现了饭店的卡瓦斯副手，</i>
<i>we discovered our own Deputy Kovacs,</i>

374
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:48,131
<i>当然，他也是位名律师。</i>
<i>himself an important
attorney, of course.</i>

375
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:51,801
<i>他来执行这位去世寡妇的遗产。</i>
<i>He was the executor
of the dead widow's estate.</i>

376
00:25:58,475 --> 00:26:01,478
这是D夫人的遗愿和遗嘱。
This is Madame D's last
will and testament.

377
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:04,898
其中包括，
It consists of a general tontine

378
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:08,943
46年前，她丈夫去世前签署的一份养老保险，
drawn up before the event of her
husband's death 46 years ago,

379
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:12,280
以及635条改动，
in combination with 635 amendments,

380
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:15,200
标记，修正和遗书，

381
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:18,453
这些要在接下来的数十年间执行。

subsequent decades.

382
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,470
这堆东西的最终合法权
The ultimate legality
of this accumulation

383
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:23,917
需要进一步证实，

384
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:27,087
但本办公室认为，D夫人的意愿是，
but in the opinion of this office,
it was Madame D's intention

385
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:29,214
将她的大批财产，
that control of the
vast bulk of her estate

387
00:26:32,217 --> 00:26:34,928
并为她的姐妹准备了特殊补贴，
with special allowances
for his sisters,

388
00:26:35,095 --> 00:26:37,430
她们是玛格丽特，拉提莎和卡洛琳娜，
Marguerite, Laetizia, and Carolina,

389
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:40,809
还为家族内其余各位准备了小礼物，
and minor gifts for various members
of the extended family

390
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:44,396
领受人名单在此，我会在适当时候阐明。

which I will elucidate in due course.

391
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:47,941
然而，
However.

392
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:52,821
有一条遗嘱附录，
An additional codicil,

393
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:56,199
刚刚在今早被邮送到我手上，
delivered into my possession
by post only this morning,

394
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:58,868
而且所有证据表明，这是出自D夫人之手，
and, by all indications,
sent by Madame D

395
00:26:59,077 --> 00:27:00,438
是她在生命中最后几小时写下，
during the last hours of her life,

396
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:03,039
内容是对原证明的一条改动，

你个死基佬！

He's a concierge. What

叫警察来。我们要告你。

哦是啊，是啊，当然是了。
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

432
00:28:56,653 --> 00:28:59,531
要是让我知道，你曾经碰过我母亲的身体，
If I learn you ever once
laid a finger on my mother's body,

433
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:03,159

living or dead, I swear to God,
I'll cut your throat! You hear me?

a fucking faggot.

- 咱们换个话题吧。
- You are, but you're bisexual.
- Let's change the subject.

436
00:29:09,374 --> 00:29:10,417
我要走了。
I'm leaving.

00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:22,637
那张画，<i>拿着苹果的男孩，</i>是无价之宝。明白吗？
That picture, <i>Boy with Apple,</i>
is priceless. Understand?

438
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:24,431
恭喜你，古斯塔夫<i>先生</i>！
Congratulations, <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave!

439
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:26,517
他们要为了这个小混蛋和我打架。
They're going to fight me
for the son of a bitch.

440
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:28,977
- 它美吗？
- 难以言喻。
- Is it very beautiful?
- Beyond description.

- Can I see it?

444

为什么不呢。
I don't see why not.

445
00:30:10,268 --> 00:30:12,604
这是范.霍特最为精致的肖像
This is van Hoytl's
exquisite portrayal

446
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:15,148
画了一位束发之年的漂亮男孩。
of a beautiful boy on
the cusp of manhood.

447
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:18,068
金发。光滑。皮肤和那杯牛奶一样雪白。
Blond, smooth.
Skin as white as that milk.

448
00:30:18,193 --> 00:30:19,444
无暇。
Of impeccable provenance.

449
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:23,239
最后留在民间的珍品中，这无疑是最好的。
One of the last in private hands,
and unquestionably, the best.

450
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:24,699
杰作。
It's a masterpiece.

451
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:27,077
其他的都是没用的垃圾。
The rest of this shit
is worthless junk.

452
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,500
我能帮你点什么？

453
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,220
有的，瑟奇。

454
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,750
请帮我把它包起来。

455
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
把“拿着苹果的男孩”包起来...?

456
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:48,533
你之前想和我说什么？
What did you want
to tell me, before?

457
00:31:49,784 --> 00:31:51,786
我想我没法现在说。
I think I cannot say right now.

458
00:31:52,162 --> 00:31:54,414
明天给我写信吧。去路兹巴汉车站！
Write me tomorrow. Lutzbahn Station!

459
00:32:06,384 --> 00:32:08,386
我不想与它分离。
I'll never part with it.

460
00:32:08,553 --> 00:32:12,849
这让她想起我，也会让我想起她。永远。
It reminded her of me.
It will remind me of her. Always.

461
00:32:13,266 --> 00:32:15,810
我死的时候要把它挂在床头。
I'll die with this
picture above my bed.

462
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:18,146
看我们像不像？
See the resemblance?

463
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:21,149
嗯，像。
Oh, yes.

464
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:28,198
事实上我们应该把它卖了。
Actually, we should sell it.

465
00:32:28,406 --> 00:32:31,409
赶早不赶晚，以防他们想把画偷回去。
Sooner rather than later,
in case they try to steal it back.

466
00:32:31,576 --> 00:32:34,329
而且，列车上那些疯颠颠的步兵...
Plus, something about those lunatic
foot-soldiers on the express...

467
00:32:34,537 --> 00:32:37,832
这可能是咱们饭店行业的一场棘手战斗，也会迎来很长的萧条期。
This could be a tricky war and a
long dry spell in the hotel trade.

468
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:40,585
据我所知，他们在明天就能追上咱们。
For all we know, they could
board us up tomorrow.

469
00:32:46,883 --> 00:32:48,843
咱们做个庄严的血誓吧。
Let's make a solemn blood-pact.

470
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:51,539
咱们联系黑市，在这周末把<i>拿着苹果的男孩</i>
We'll contact the black market
and liquidate <i>Boy with Apple</i>

471
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:52,597
兑成现款，
by the end of the week,

472
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:55,600
然后离开这个国家，在马耳他海滨沿岸的某处低调生活
then leave the country and lay low
somewhere along the Maltese Riviera

473
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:58,395
直到风波平息，咱们再回到岗位上。
until the troubles blow over
and we resume our posts.

474
00:32:58,603 --> 00:33:00,355
作为你提供帮助，对我忠诚，
In exchange for your
help, your loyalty

475
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:02,357
并作为我私人男仆的交换，
and your services as
my personal valet,

476
00:33:02,565 --> 00:33:07,153
我保证给你净销售价的1.5%。
I pledge to you 1.5%
of the net sale price.

477
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,322
- 1.5？
- 包住宿和路费。
- 1.5?
- Plus room and board.

478
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,243
- 能给我10个百分点吗？
- 10？你开玩笑呢？
- Could we make it 10?
- 10? Are you joking?

479
00:33:13,451 --> 00:33:15,203
那比我给画贩子的都多，
That's more than I'd
pay an actual dealer,

480
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:17,580
而且光啃鸡杂碎你又不会懂明暗对照法。
and you wouldn't know
chiaroscuro from chicken giblets.

481
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:19,541
不行，1.5正好。但是我告诉你，
No, 1.5 is correct. But
I'll tell you what,

482
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:22,836
如果我先死了，我肯定会让你成为我的唯一继承人。
if I die first, and I most certainly
will, you will be my sole heir.

483
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:25,972
咱们的资产不多只有一套象牙背面的梳子
There's not much in the kitty except
a set of ivory-backed hairbrushes

484
00:33:26,214 --> 00:33:27,575
和我收藏的浪漫诗集，
and my library of romantic poetry,

485
00:33:27,674 --> 00:33:30,385
但到时候，这些都是你的，
but when the time comes,
these will be yours,

486
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:33,763
还有咱们没花在找姑娘和喝酒上的所有玩意。
along with whatever we haven't
already spent on whores and whiskey.

487
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:36,599
咱们神圣地结盟。
This is our sacred bond.

488
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:38,768
我得现在写下来。
I'll draw it up right now.

489
00:33:43,773 --> 00:33:47,819
我，古斯塔夫.H<i>先生</i>，目前精神和身体状况尚算完好，
I, <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave H, being of
relatively sound mind and body,

490
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:51,865
在今天，十月19日，于我主的1932年...
on this day, the 19th of October,
in the year of our Lord 1932...

491
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,909
<i>他从没告诉我他从哪里来。</i>
<i>He never told me where he came from.</i>

492
00:33:58,496 --> 00:34:00,707
<i>我也从未问过他家人是谁。</i>
<i>I never asked who his
family had been.</i>

493
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:23,646
打扰一下。
Excuse me.

494
00:34:24,397 --> 00:34:25,398
嗯哼？
Uh-huh?

495
00:34:26,524 --> 00:34:29,819
警察来了，要见你。
The police are here.
They asked for you.

496
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,742
告诉他们我马上就来。
Tell them I'll be right down.

497
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:38,578
好。
Okay.

498
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:45,712
你被当局审问过吗？
Have you ever been questioned
by the authorities?

499
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:48,672
有过，有一次我被叛军抓走折磨
Yes, on one occasion I was arrested
and tortured by the rebel militia

500
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:49,881
就在沙漠起义之后。
after the Desert Uprising.

501
00:34:50,256 --> 00:34:52,136
- 那你就知道该怎么办了。别说话。
- 没问题。
- You know the drill, then. Zip it.
- Of course.

502
00:34:52,425 --> 00:34:55,720
你这辈子没听过“范.霍特”这个词。好，我们走。
You've never heard the word "van
Hoytl" in your life. Okay, let's go.

503
00:35:10,735 --> 00:35:12,737
我们可以为你做点什么，先生们？
How may we serve you, gentlemen?

504
00:35:13,988 --> 00:35:15,281
啊，是汉克斯督查。
Ah, Inspector Henckels.

505
00:35:15,448 --> 00:35:17,867
"根据朱波罗卡省警务处处长的命令，
"By order of the Commissioner
of Police, Zubrowka Province,

506
00:35:18,326 --> 00:35:19,911
"我在此将你拘留，
"I hereby place you under arrest
for the murder

507
00:35:20,036 --> 00:35:22,622
"罪名是谋杀塞琳.维伦纽.戴斯高夫塔克西斯。"
"of Madame Ceine Villeneuve
Desgoffe und Taxis."

508
00:35:22,747 --> 00:35:25,834
我就知道有什么不对劲。我们并不知道死因。
I knew there was something fishy.
We never got the cause of death.

509
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:29,337
她被杀了，你认为是我做的。
She's been murdered and
you think I did it.

510
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,882
嘿！
Hey!

511
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:36,761
站住！
Stop!

512
00:36:25,894 --> 00:36:27,937
发生了什么？
What happened?

513
00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:30,690
发生了什么，亲爱的零，就是我打得那个小矮子，
What happened, my dear Zero,
is I beat the living shit

514
00:36:30,815 --> 00:36:33,568
小粉.班迪斯基涕泗横流，
out of a sniveling little runt
called Pinky Bandinski

515
00:36:33,735 --> 00:36:35,570
他有胆子质疑我的男子气概，
who had the gall to
question my virility,

516
00:36:35,695 --> 00:36:37,947
如果我们能从这场廉价的闹剧中学到点什么，
because if there's one thing we've
learned from penny dreadfuls,

517
00:36:38,073 --> 00:36:40,234
那就是，当你发现身处于这样的地方时，
it's that, when you find yourself
in a place like this,

518
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,826
可千万别当软蛋。
you must never be a candy-ass.

519
00:36:41,993 --> 00:36:43,953
你得从第一天就证明自己。
You've got to prove
yourself from Day One.

520
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,663
你得赢得他们的尊重。
You've got to win their respect.

521
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:49,042
你应该好好看看他早上那张丑脸。
You should take a long look
at his ugly mug this morning.

522
00:36:52,545 --> 00:36:54,422
他，其实，变成了我的好朋友。
He's, actually,
become a dear friend.

523
00:36:54,589 --> 00:36:56,007
我希望以后你能见见他。
You'll meet him, I hope.

524
00:36:56,966 --> 00:36:59,010
那么，你和卡瓦斯谈过了吗？
So. You've talked to Kovacs?

525
00:36:59,427 --> 00:37:00,720
我昨晚偷偷见他了。
I saw him last night in secret.

526
00:37:00,887 --> 00:37:03,168
他让我用圣经起誓不会告诉别人。
He made me take an oath on a
Bible I wouldn't tell a soul.

527
00:37:03,431 --> 00:37:05,725
- 你也应该这样做。
- 一会儿吧。
- You're supposed to also.
- I'll do that later.

528
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,436
- 他怀疑你是无辜的。
- 他当然要怀疑了。
- He suspects you're innocent.
- Of course he does.

529
00:37:08,603 --> 00:37:10,438
罪名是什么？
What's the charge?

530
00:37:11,773 --> 00:37:14,734
十月19日凌晨，
In the small hours
of the evening of 19 October,

531
00:37:14,901 --> 00:37:17,946
这里大大小小都认识的人，古斯塔夫<i>先生</i>，
an individual well-known to the house
and staff, a <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave H,

532
00:37:18,113 --> 00:37:21,408
来到了路兹的戴斯高夫塔克西斯宅邸，
did arrive at the Desgoffe
und Taxis residence in Lutz

533
00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:23,993
从后巷进入，
and entered by the
rear service alley,

534
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,578
没让任何人发现他的到来，
alerting no one to his presence,

535
00:37:25,787 --> 00:37:29,582
而后从走过后楼梯和仆人通道，
and did then proceed by way of
back stairs and servants' passage,

536
00:37:29,749 --> 00:37:32,002
来到D夫人的私室。
to deliver himself into
the private chambers of Madame D.

537
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:34,796
没有证据表明这次来访
There is no evidence
to indicate whether this visit

538
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:37,549
是否有与她事先安排。
had been pre-arranged
with her or not.

539
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:42,637
第二天D夫人被发现死于宁碱中度。
The next morning Madame D was
found dead by strychnine poisoning.

540
00:37:42,804 --> 00:37:44,965
古斯塔夫<i>先生</i>没再出现在此房内，
<i>Monsieur </i>Gustave was not observed
on the premises again

541
00:37:45,056 --> 00:37:48,184
当然，直到24小时后。
until, of course, 24 hours later.

542
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,106
原告的身份已在证言中表明。
The identity of his accusers is made
clear in this notarized deposition.

543
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:56,818
他们主要包括，家族内所有成员，
They include, essentially,
all members of the extended family,

544
00:37:56,985 --> 00:38:01,740
但宣称见证以上事件的关键目击证人，
but the key witness who actually
ostensibly saw the alleged events

545
00:38:01,906 --> 00:38:04,617
逃离了司法管辖。
appears to have fled
the jurisdiction.

546
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:06,536
目前他行踪不明，
His whereabouts are
currently unknown,

547
00:38:06,661 --> 00:38:09,164
但相关当局正在搜捕他。
but he's being sought and pursued
by the relevant authorities.

548
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:11,624
他是谁？
Who is he?

549
00:38:15,712 --> 00:38:17,797
- 瑟奇？
- 恐怕是的。
- Serge?
- I'm afraid so.

550
00:38:18,006 --> 00:38:20,216
那个小杂种。
That little prick.

551
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:22,635
不我不相信。他们陷害他的。
No, I don't believe it.
They put him up to it.

552
00:38:22,844 --> 00:38:24,929
我算是掉进蛇窝了。
I've been dropped into
a nest of vipers.

553
00:38:25,096 --> 00:38:26,097
你能辩解吗？
You have an alibi?

554
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:28,634
当然，但她嫁给了威斯特法拉公爵。
Of course, but she's married
to the Duke of Westphalia.

555
00:38:28,767 --> 00:38:31,478
我不能让她的姓氏被这样胡闹。
I can't allow her name to get
mixed-up in all this monkey business.

556
00:38:31,644 --> 00:38:35,482
- 你危在旦夕啊。
- 我知道，但这混蛋跑了。
- Your life may be at stake.
- I know, but the bitch legged it.

557
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:39,235
她已经登上了<i>皇后纳斯塔莎号</i>，快到荷属坦噶尼喀了。
She's already onboard the <i>Queen
Nasstasja</i> halfway to Dutch Tanganyika.

558
00:38:41,863 --> 00:38:43,073
别放弃。
Don't give up.

559
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:50,538
<i>这场合谋的细节，</i>
<i>The details of the conspiracy,</i>

560
00:38:51,831 --> 00:38:53,917
<i>现在有案可查，</i>
<i>now a matter of public record,</i>

561
00:38:54,084 --> 00:38:57,170
<i>而当时，我们无法获得。</i>
<i>were, at that time,
impossible for us to apprehend.</i>

562
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,106
我在找瑟奇.X，
I'm looking for Serge X,

563
00:39:16,272 --> 00:39:19,150
一个为我雇主服务的年轻人，
a young man in the
service of my employer,

564
00:39:19,526 --> 00:39:22,946
在路兹城的戴斯高夫塔克西斯家里工作。
the family Desgoffe und Taxis
of Schloss Lutz.

565
00:39:24,614 --> 00:39:26,074
- 怎么了，先生？
- 你是他的姐姐？
- Yes, sir?
- You're his sister?

566
00:39:26,908 --> 00:39:28,743
- 是的，先生。
- 最近见过他吗？
- Yes, sir.
- Seen him lately?

567
00:39:29,911 --> 00:39:31,996
- 没有，先生。
- 没有，先生？
- No, sir.
- No, sir?

568
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:34,082
没有，先生。
No, sir.

569
00:39:37,585 --> 00:39:40,213
我得立即找到他，为了保护他
I need to find him right away,
for his own safety

570
00:39:40,588 --> 00:39:42,007
以及大家。
and everybody else's.

571
00:39:42,215 --> 00:39:44,968
如果他出现...
If he shows up...

572
00:39:45,093 --> 00:39:47,887
- 是的，先生？
- 告诉他杰普林说了，
- Yes, sir?
- Tell him Jopling says,

573
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:50,306
"回家吧。"
"Come home."

574
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,061
<i>但有一件事很肯定，</i>
<i>But one thing was certain,</i>

575
00:39:57,105 --> 00:40:00,775
<i>戴斯高夫塔克西斯家非常显赫，</i>
<i>the Desgoffe und Taxis
were a very powerful family,</i>

576
00:40:04,904 --> 00:40:07,073
<i>而且我们没时间了。</i>
<i>and time was not on our side.</i>

577
00:40:15,081 --> 00:40:17,917
古斯塔夫<i>先生</i>的来信。
零。
A letter from <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave.
Zero.

578
00:40:18,835 --> 00:40:20,837
- 你想让我读？
- 读吧。
- You want me to?
- Read it.

579
00:40:26,718 --> 00:40:28,678
"我亲爱的，可信的同事们..."
"My dear and trusted colleagues..."

580
00:40:28,845 --> 00:40:30,889
我深深地想念你们，因此我在这监禁我的，
I miss you deeply
as I write from the confines

581
00:40:31,056 --> 00:40:34,059
可悲又荒谬的栏杆后面，给你们写信。
of my regrettable
and preposterous incarceration.

582
00:40:34,225 --> 00:40:36,311
直到我再次恢复自由身，
Until I walk amongst you again
as a free man,

583
00:40:36,644 --> 00:40:38,938
布达佩斯大饭店都在你们手中，
the Grand Budapest remains
in your hands,

584
00:40:39,147 --> 00:40:41,274
而它完美的地位也在你们手中。
as does its impeccable reputation.

585
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:43,651
维护它的无瑕，光耀它，
Keep it spotless and glorify it.

586
00:40:43,818 --> 00:40:46,071
对每一丁丁点小角落都爱护有加，
Take extra special care
of every little-bitty bit of it

587
00:40:46,237 --> 00:40:48,323
好似我还在盯着你们，像只老鹰一样，
as if I were watching
over you like a hawk

588
00:40:48,656 --> 00:40:52,035
爪子里还抓着马鞭。没错，我就是这样。
with a horse whip in its talons,
because I am.

589
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:55,246
如果我发现，我离开的时候有任何一丝改变，
Should I discover a lapse
of any variety during my absence,

590
00:40:55,622 --> 00:40:59,125
我发誓，正义会立刻无情地制裁你。
I promise, swift and merciless
justice will descend upon you.

591
00:40:59,292 --> 00:41:03,254
一座伟大又高贵的房子正要你们来守护。
A great and noble house has been
placed under your protection.

592
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,132
如有任何不规矩的事发生，告诉零。
Tell Zero if you see
any funny business.

593
00:41:06,299 --> 00:41:08,385
"爱你们的，古斯塔夫<i>先生</i>。"
"Your devoted <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave."

594
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,080
这之后还有一首诗，但我们也许可以开始喝汤了，
Then there's a poem, but we
might want to start on the soup

595
00:41:11,137 --> 00:41:13,640
因为这诗有46节长。
since it's 46 stanzas.

596
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:17,394
"一粒黑色、微潮的灰尘，沾湿了黑鼠窝的污秽
"A moist, black ash dampens the
filth of a dung-dark rat's nest

597
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:19,854
"又混杂了腐木浓厚的香气
"and mingles with the thick scent
of wood rot

598
00:41:20,021 --> 00:41:21,856
"流浪儿像百灵鸟一样唱起歌..."
"while the lark song
of a guttersnipe..."

599
00:41:22,023 --> 00:41:24,234
我从不相信那个管家。
I never trusted that butler.

600
00:41:24,401 --> 00:41:28,154
- 他太诚实了。<i>
- 你说他太诚实了？</i>
- He's too honest.<i>
- Too honest, you say?</i>

601
00:41:28,279 --> 00:41:32,742
<i>好吧，那，如果可以的话，找到他，解决他。</i>
<i>Right, well, be that as it may,
find him quick and make it snappy.</i>

602
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:51,428
犯人们，有要喝玉米粥的吗？
May I offer any of you inmates
a plate of mush?

603
00:41:54,055 --> 00:41:55,390
没有吗？
No? Anyone?

604
00:41:55,765 --> 00:41:57,976
那位脸上有一大块疤的呢？
You with the very large
scar on your face?

605
00:42:07,277 --> 00:42:10,196
试试吧。今天早上它还是热乎的，又有营养。
Try it. It's actually quite warm
and nourishing this morning.

606
00:42:10,321 --> 00:42:11,364
来一撮盐。
It needs a dash of salt.

607
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:21,916
日安。
Good day.

608
00:42:26,796 --> 00:42:28,798
玉米粥，先生们，有人喝吗？
Mush, gents? Any takers?

609
00:42:32,886 --> 00:42:34,304
请便。
Suit yourselves.

610
00:42:39,976 --> 00:42:41,519
起床啦。快，快。
Rise and shine. Chop, chop.

611
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:44,314
早上好，小粉。
Good morning, Pinky.

612
00:42:50,153 --> 00:42:52,822
- 又是门德尔家的点心？
- 正是。
- Mendl's again?
- Precisely.

613
00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:54,991
谁有割喉刀？
Who's got the throat slitter?

614
00:43:00,497 --> 00:43:03,416
- 无可比拟。
- 门德尔家是最棒的的。
- Out of this world.
- Mendl's is the best.

615
00:43:03,792 --> 00:43:05,877
- 好了，该干活了。
- 古斯塔夫<i>先生？</i>
- Well, back to work.<i>
- Monsieur </i>Gustave?

616
00:43:09,339 --> 00:43:10,882
嗯？
Yes?

617
00:43:14,511 --> 00:43:16,930
我和伙计们谈了谈。
Me and the boys talked it over.

618
00:43:17,138 --> 00:43:19,516
我们认为你真的很正直。
We think you're a
really straight fellow.

619
00:43:19,849 --> 00:43:21,976
从来没人骂过我正直，
Well, I've never been accused
of that before,

620
00:43:22,185 --> 00:43:24,145
不过我很欣赏你的观点。
but I appreciate the sentiment.

621
00:43:24,312 --> 00:43:25,814
你是我们的一员了。
You're one of us now.

622
00:43:27,023 --> 00:43:28,983
这话说得真好。
What a lovely thing to say.

623
00:43:29,192 --> 00:43:31,111
谢谢，亲爱的小粉。
谢谢，顾瑟。
Thank you, dear Pinky.
Thank you, Günther.

624
00:43:31,236 --> 00:43:32,779
谢谢，老狼。
Thank you, Wolf.

625
00:43:32,946 --> 00:43:34,948
还有别的事儿吗？
Anything else?

626
00:43:36,825 --> 00:43:37,867
路德维格，告诉他。
Tell him, Ludwig.

627
00:43:39,828 --> 00:43:43,081
19号检查站并不是个好搞定的拘留所。
Checkpoint 19 ain't
no two-bit hoosegow.

628
00:43:43,206 --> 00:43:46,418
他们在每扇门窗还有通风口上，都宽宏大量地安了铁栏杆。
You got broad-gauge iron bars
on every door, vent and window.

629
00:43:46,793 --> 00:43:50,255
一层楼有72个守卫，塔里还有16个。
You got 72 guards on the floor
and 16 more in the towers.

630
00:43:50,422 --> 00:43:54,843
护城河那有个325英尺的洞，河里全是鳄鱼。
You got a 325-foot drop
into a moat full of crocodiles.

631
00:43:55,051 --> 00:43:57,012
但就和所有的好监狱一样，它也有弱点，
But, like the best of them,
it's got a soft spot,

632
00:43:57,178 --> 00:43:58,972
在这儿恰巧就是
which in this case
happens to take the form

633
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:01,224
雨水下水道系统，
of a storm-drain sewer system

634
00:44:01,391 --> 00:44:03,810
它的年头得追溯到中世纪
dating from the time
of the original rock fortification

635
00:44:04,019 --> 00:44:06,062
还用石头筑垒的时候了。
way back in the Middle Ages.

636
00:44:06,229 --> 00:44:09,315
现在，我不是说这是要在林荫大道，
Now, nobody's saying it's a stroll
down a tree-lined promenade

637
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:11,234
和一位漂亮小姐还有只白色贵宾散步，
with a fine lady and a white poodle,

638
00:44:11,401 --> 00:44:15,113
但这就是你得称作“漏洞”的东西，
but it's got what you'd
call "vulnerability,"

639
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,033
这就是我们的命根了。
and that's our bread and butter.

640
00:44:18,908 --> 00:44:21,036
看。
Take a look.

641
00:44:22,203 --> 00:44:23,455
谁画的？
Who drew this?

642
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:25,915
你这话什么意思？我画的。
What do you mean,
"Who drew this?" I did.

643
00:44:26,082 --> 00:44:28,168
画得好。你的线条画的太棒了，路德维格。
Very good. You've got a
wonderful line, Ludwig.

644
00:44:28,293 --> 00:44:30,045
这是极大的艺术天赋。
This shows great artistic promise.

645
00:44:30,211 --> 00:44:33,506
问题是，你打算怎么穿透这个又低又旧的下水道？
Question, how do you intend
to penetrate this lowest rudiment?

646
00:44:33,882 --> 00:44:36,301
它是25英寸的花岗岩加固砌成的，不是吗？
It's 25 inches of reinforced
granite masonry, is it not?

647
00:44:36,468 --> 00:44:38,219
拿一把割喉刀挖，
Digging with the throat-slitter,

648
00:44:38,428 --> 00:44:41,139
我想至少要连续挖上3到6个月，
I expect this would take three
to six months of continual effort,

649
00:44:41,264 --> 00:44:42,849
在此期间，我们中有数位，
during which time
several of our members

650
00:44:43,058 --> 00:44:44,419
都要被残忍地处死。
will have been violently executed.

651
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:47,020
你说到点上了，古斯塔夫先生。
You hit the nail on the
head, Mr. Gustave.

652
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:49,856
我们有假证件，二手衣服，
We got fake documents,
second-hand street clothes,

653
00:44:50,023 --> 00:44:52,317
一个用棍子和床铺线绳做的绳梯，
a rope ladder made of
sticks and bunk-linens,

654
00:44:52,484 --> 00:44:54,402
但我们需要挖掘工具，
but we need digging tools,

655
00:44:54,569 --> 00:44:57,530
在这破地方可不好拿。
which are proving hard to come by
in this flop-house.

656
00:45:12,045 --> 00:45:13,463
<i>故事讲到这里，</i>
<i>At this point in the story,</i>

657
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:17,300
<i>老人突然沉默，并把桌上的羊脊肉推开。</i>
<i>the old man fell silent
and pushed away his saddle of lamb.</i>

658
00:45:17,467 --> 00:45:20,345
<i>他的双眼像石头一样没了光彩。</i>
<i>His eyes went blank as two stones.</i>

659
00:45:20,512 --> 00:45:22,514
<i>看得出来，他陷入了痛苦。</i>
<i>I could see he was in distress.</i>

660
00:45:22,889 --> 00:45:25,308
- 你病了吗，穆斯塔法先生？<i>
- 我终于问出了口。</i>
- Are you ill, Mr. Moustafa?<i>
- I finally asked.</i>

661
00:45:25,475 --> 00:45:27,894
- 哦老天，没有。<i>
- 他说。</i>
- Oh, dear me, no.<i>
- He said.</i>

662
00:45:28,103 --> 00:45:30,438
我只是不知道该如何说下去。
It's only that I don't
know how to proceed.

663
00:45:31,606 --> 00:45:33,942
<i>他流泪了。</i>
<i>He was crying.</i>

664
00:45:34,109 --> 00:45:35,527
你瞧，我从没讲过阿加莎的事，
You see, I never speak of Agatha,

665
00:45:35,652 --> 00:45:39,322
因为仅仅想起她的名字，
because even at the
thought of her name

666
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:42,283
我都没办法控制住情绪。
I'm unable to control my emotions.

667
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:47,580
好吧，我想也没别的办法了。
Well, I suppose there's
no way around it.

668
00:45:48,998 --> 00:45:51,251
你看，是她救了我们。
You see, she saved us.

669
00:45:51,501 --> 00:45:53,378
<i>在我们第三次正式约会时，</i>
<i>On our third formal rendezvous,</i>

670
00:45:53,545 --> 00:45:56,339
<i>我向她求婚，她答应了。</i>
<i>I had asked for her hand in marriage
and she had agreed.</i>

671
00:45:56,548 --> 00:45:58,550
- 嫁给我好吗？
- 好。
- Will you marry me?
- Yes.

672
00:46:00,385 --> 00:46:03,304
<i>我们两个人身上连50块钱都没有。</i>
<i>We did not have 50 Klubecks
between the two of us.</i>

673
00:46:03,471 --> 00:46:06,683
<i>我俩当然并不知情，但知道了，谁又会在乎呢？</i>
<i>No one knew, of course,
but, then, who would have cared?</i>

674
00:46:07,017 --> 00:46:09,602
<i>世界仿佛就剩下我们两个，</i>
<i>We were each
completely on our own in the world,</i>

675
00:46:10,937 --> 00:46:12,939
<i>而我们如此相爱。</i>
<i>and we were deeply in love.</i>

676
00:46:21,573 --> 00:46:23,450
- 给你。
- 谢谢。
- Here.
- Thank you.

677
00:46:23,616 --> 00:46:25,493
- 是本书。
- 这样。
- It's a book.
- I see.

678
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:27,245
<i>浪漫诗选，第一卷。</i>
<i>Romantic Poetry, Volume One.</i>

679
00:46:27,412 --> 00:46:29,972
古斯塔夫<i>先生</i>推荐的，我自己也有一本。
<i>Monsieur </i>Gustave recommended it.
I have a copy of my own as well.

680
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:34,085
- 我想我把惊喜给破坏了。
- 我怎么都要打开的。
- I ruined the surprise, I suppose.
- I'll go ahead and open it, anyway.

681
00:46:37,464 --> 00:46:39,466
读读献词。
Read the inscription.

682
00:46:58,068 --> 00:46:59,152
古斯塔夫<i>先生</i>坚持，
Monsieur <i>Gustave insisted</i>

683
00:46:59,319 --> 00:47:01,529
<i>要对我立刻彻底的盘问...</i>
<i>on an immediate
and thorough cross-examination...</i>

684
00:47:01,696 --> 00:47:04,449
她真迷人。她太迷人了。
She's charming. She's so charming.

685
00:47:04,574 --> 00:47:07,118
<i>期间，他向阿加莎展示了一个瓷吊坠</i>
<i>during which he presented Agatha
with a porcelain pendant</i>

686
00:47:07,285 --> 00:47:10,205
<i>还有五打自己包装的白郁金香，</i>
<i>and five dozen individually
tissue-wrapped white tulips</i>

687
00:47:10,413 --> 00:47:12,499
<i>都放在一个婴儿棺材般大的盒子里。</i>
<i>in a box the size of
a child's coffin.</i>

688
00:47:12,665 --> 00:47:15,418
- 这样不对。
- 您说什么？
- It's not right.
- I beg your pardon?

689
00:47:15,585 --> 00:47:16,711
他怎么气哼哼的？
Why is he sulking?

690
00:47:17,087 --> 00:47:19,087
她是我女朋友。
你不能这么给她买东西。
She's my girlfriend.
You can't just buy her things.

691
00:47:19,172 --> 00:47:22,425
我只是代表你，和这个孤独美丽的幻景说说话。
I'm only interviewing this vision
of loveliness on your behalf.

692
00:47:22,592 --> 00:47:25,261
这辈子也别嫉妒别人，零，一秒钟也别嫉妒。
Never be jealous in this life, Zero,
not even for an instant.

693
00:47:25,428 --> 00:47:27,055
他是不是在和你调情？
Is he flirting with you?

694
00:47:28,306 --> 00:47:31,393
- 是的。
- 我同意你们结合。
- Yes.
- I approve of this union.

695
00:47:31,601 --> 00:47:34,187
阿加莎，我的美人，回到你挚爱的人身旁吧。
Agatha, my beauty,
return to your beloved.

696
00:47:34,354 --> 00:47:35,605
<i>很快我们就知道...</i>
<i>Soon we learned...</i>

697
00:47:35,772 --> 00:47:37,524
祝福你们两个。
Blessings upon you both.

698
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:39,442
<i>阿加莎不仅仅是非常精通</i>
<i>not only was Agatha
immensely skilled</i>

699
00:47:39,651 --> 00:47:42,237
<i>使用铲刀和黄油奶油花式...</i>
<i>with a palette knife
and a butter-cream flourish...</i>

700
00:47:42,404 --> 00:47:44,406
- 门德尔来了。
- 快。
- Mendl.
- Go.

701
00:47:45,532 --> 00:47:47,534
<i>她还十分勇敢。</i>
<i>she was also very brave.</i>

702
00:47:52,122 --> 00:47:54,207
<i>我想她生来就是那样。</i>
<i>I believe she was born that way.</i>

703
00:48:13,518 --> 00:48:15,562
少点什么。
Something's missing.

704
00:48:15,687 --> 00:48:20,275
一份关键的文件，要么就是找不见了，
要么，可想而知，被毁了。
A crucial document, either misplaced
or, conceivably, destroyed.

705
00:48:20,442 --> 00:48:22,922
我不知道上面写了什么，
我不知道那代表着什么，
I don't know what it contains,
I don't know what it represents,

706
00:48:23,194 --> 00:48:24,487
我不知道那是什么，
I don't know what it is,

707
00:48:24,696 --> 00:48:27,782
但是到处有都它的踪影。
but there are traces
and shadows of it everywhere.

708
00:48:28,116 --> 00:48:29,701
我现在不是想警告你们，
Now, I don't want to alarm you,

709
00:48:29,868 --> 00:48:31,748
而且我不希望，
and I don't expect to see any
significant change

710
00:48:31,786 --> 00:48:34,789
裁判官对你财产继承的最终裁决有什么大的变动，
in the magistrate's ultimate decision
vis-a-vis your own inheritance,

711
00:48:35,165 --> 00:48:38,793
但，尤其是鉴于她死亡的特殊情况，
but, especially given the
circumstances of the death,

712
00:48:39,169 --> 00:48:43,548
以及谋杀案的关键证人，瑟奇.X消失不见，
as well as the disappearance of the key
witness in the murder case, Serge X,

713
00:48:43,715 --> 00:48:45,556
我建议我们立刻把这件事
I suggest that
we immediately bring this matter

714
00:48:45,592 --> 00:48:47,761
上报至市督查
to the attention of the
municipal inspector

715
00:48:48,136 --> 00:48:49,816
这样才不会在未来
so that there can be
absolutely no question

716
00:48:50,096 --> 00:48:52,390
有任何不得体的事情发生。
of impropriety at any future date.

717
00:48:52,557 --> 00:48:54,351
- 同意吗？
- 不同意。
- Agreed?
- Not agreed.

718
00:48:56,227 --> 00:48:58,313
- 不同意？
- 不同意。
- Not agreed?
- Not agreed.

719
00:49:00,899 --> 00:49:04,319
- 我能问个问题吗，维莫斯？
- 请说，迪米崔？
- Can I ask you a question, Vilmos?
- Yes, Dmitri?

720
00:49:04,444 --> 00:49:07,197
- 你究竟为谁工作？
- 您说什么？
- Who are you working for?
- I beg your pardon?

721
00:49:07,364 --> 00:49:11,159
你为谁工作？我还以为你是我们的律师。
Who are you working for? I thought
you're supposed to be our lawyer.

722
00:49:11,326 --> 00:49:14,621
唔，实际上，我是遗产执行人。
Well, in point of fact,
I'm the executor of the estate.

723
00:49:14,788 --> 00:49:18,875
在这种特殊情况下，我代表去世的夫人。
In this particular situation,
I represent the deceased.

724
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:20,251
哦是吗？
Oh, yeah?

725
00:49:20,377 --> 00:49:23,171
是的，付给我的款项里包括...
Yeah. A provision for my fees
was included in the...

726
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:28,176
别废话了，也别和我争，同意吗？
Just wrap it up
and don't make waves. Agreed?

727
00:49:30,178 --> 00:49:34,224
我是名律师。我的义务是根据法律处理事情。
I'm an attorney. I'm obligated to
proceed according to the rule of law.

728
00:49:35,517 --> 00:49:36,601
不同意。
Not agreed.

729
00:49:43,274 --> 00:49:45,318
姐妹们，这可真讨厌。
This stinks, sisters.

730
00:49:48,697 --> 00:49:50,740
他刚刚把我的猫扔到窗外了？
Did he just throw my
cat out the window?

731
00:49:52,158 --> 00:49:53,785
我不这么认为。
I don't think so.

732
00:49:53,868 --> 00:49:54,869
- 没有吧，扔了吗？
- 杰普林？
- No. Did he?
- Jopling?

733
00:50:21,855 --> 00:50:23,857
好吧。
Okay.

734
00:50:34,492 --> 00:50:37,287
有件事我没告诉你，阿加莎。
There's something
I haven't told you, Agatha.

735
00:50:37,495 --> 00:50:38,663
- 说吧。
- 我们偷了一幅画。
- Okay.
- We stole a painting.

736
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:41,458
它非常值钱，可能值500万吧。
It's very valuable, maybe five
million Klubecks, in fact.

737
00:50:41,624 --> 00:50:43,543
我不知道目前别人有没有注意到它丢了，
I don't know if anyone's
even noticed it's missing yet,

738
00:50:43,668 --> 00:50:45,337
但如果我出了什么事...
but if something
should happen to me...

739
00:50:45,503 --> 00:50:46,921
你偷了艺术品？
You steal art?

740
00:50:48,006 --> 00:50:51,259
一张画。不管怎么说，为了让你活下去，
我们得做好计划。
One picture. Anyway, we need
to make a plan for your survival.

741
00:50:51,384 --> 00:50:54,264
把这个藏起来。这个加密了，而且你得用放大镜读
Hide this. It's in code and you might
need a magnifying glass to read it,

742
00:50:54,387 --> 00:50:56,598
但是它能告诉你<i>拿着苹果的男孩</i>在哪，怎么找。
but it tells you exactly where
and how to find <i>Boy with Apple.</i>

743
00:50:56,765 --> 00:50:58,808
卖的时候不要少于半价。而且...
Don't take less than half
the retail asking price. Also...

744
00:50:58,975 --> 00:51:01,728
- 零，我是个面包师。
- 你是个糕点大厨。
- Zero, I'm a baker.
- You're a pastry chef.

745
00:51:01,895 --> 00:51:03,813
我不销赃，如果我没用错词的话。
I'm not a fence, if that's the term.

746
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:05,899
我不卖脏物。
I don't trade in stolen property.

747
00:51:07,275 --> 00:51:09,277
我刚才说得不对。
画是她给他的。
I said it wrong.
She willed it to him.

748
00:51:18,453 --> 00:51:20,455
睡吧。
Go to sleep.

749
00:51:20,997 --> 00:51:22,874
是的，门德尔<i>先生</i>。
Yes, <i>Herr </i>Mendl.

750
00:51:25,669 --> 00:51:27,462
- 藏好它。
- 不要。
- Hide this.
- No.

751
00:51:27,629 --> 00:51:29,631
好吧，不管怎样，拿着吧。
Okay, but take it anyway.

752
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:58,840
<i>隔天早上，</i>先生<i>收到了
<i>The next morning,</i>
Herr <i>Becker received a peculiar,</i>

753
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:01,760
<i>卡瓦斯副手办公室的临时通知，</i>
<i>last-minute notice
from the office of Deputy Kovacs,</i>

754
00:55:01,968 --> 00:55:06,556
<i>推后他们约好的会面，直至永远。</i>
<i>postponing their scheduled meeting,
in perpetuity.</i>

755
00:55:36,628 --> 00:55:38,630
走吧。
Let's blow.

756
00:56:48,241 --> 00:56:50,952
- 你们怎么出来的？
- 快他妈闭嘴。
- How did you get out there?
- Shut the fuck up.

757
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:53,830
这些人要逃跑。
These guys are trying to escape.

758
00:56:53,997 --> 00:56:55,749
你告发我们，有病吧？
What's wrong with you,
you goddamn snitch?

759
00:56:55,915 --> 00:56:57,917
守卫！守卫！
Guard! Guard!

760
00:57:05,175 --> 00:57:08,762
是你呀。谢谢。谢谢。贴心，善良的你。
It's you. Thank you.
Thank you, you sweet, kind man.

761
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:40,627
好。
Okay.

762
00:58:54,492 --> 00:58:57,203
我猜这算得上平手。
I suppose you'd call that a draw.

763
00:59:06,296 --> 00:59:08,298
晚上好。
Good evening.

764
00:59:16,514 --> 00:59:20,226
让我介绍一下。小粉，老狼，路德维格，
这是伟大的零。
Let me introduce you. Pinky, Wolf,
Ludwig, this is the divine Zero.

765
00:59:20,393 --> 00:59:22,270
顾瑟在地下墓穴被杀了。
Günther was slain in the catacombs.

766
00:59:22,437 --> 00:59:25,231
好了，小伙子们，不知道我们什么时候能再见，
但如果有一天...
Well, boys, who knows when we'll
all meet again, but if one day...

767
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:26,483
等会。
Hold it.

768
00:59:29,486 --> 00:59:31,988
没时间瞎扯了。
No time to gab.

769
00:59:32,197 --> 00:59:34,491
保证，古斯塔夫先生。
Take care of yourself, Mr. Gustave.

770
00:59:34,824 --> 00:59:36,826
祝你好运，孩子。
Good luck, kid.

771
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:43,416
- 那条路通往安全屋？
- 我没找到安全屋。
- Which way to the safe house?
- I couldn't find one.

772
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,544
没有安全屋？真没有？
我们现在就得靠自己？
No safe house? Really?
We're completely on our own out here?

773
00:59:46,878 --> 00:59:50,006
恐怕是的。我四处问了，但...
I'm afraid so.
I asked around, but...

774
00:59:50,215 --> 00:59:53,009
我理解。太冒险了。我们可以随机应变。
I understand. Too risky. We'll
just have to wing it, I suppose.

775
00:59:53,218 --> 00:59:55,512
那咱们乔装一下吧。
Let's put on our disguises.

776
00:59:55,845 --> 00:59:57,972
- 我们已经乔装了。
- 不我们没有。
- We're wearing them.
- No, we're not.

777
00:59:58,139 --> 01:00:00,517
我们说好了有假胡子和假鼻子什么的。
We said false whiskers
and fake noses and so on.

778
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:03,269
- 你没带来？
- 我觉得你正在长胡子呢。
- You didn't bring any?
- I thought you were growing one.

779
01:00:03,436 --> 01:00:06,356
那看起来更像真的，不是吗？
And it wouldn't look
realistic, would it?

780
01:00:06,523 --> 01:00:08,858
是，如果弄得好，看起来就像是真的。
No, when done properly,
they're perfectly convincing.

781
01:00:09,025 --> 01:00:10,985
不过我理解你的意思。就这样吧。
But I take your point. So be it.

782
01:00:11,152 --> 01:00:13,530
给我喷几下华丽香氛古龙水，好吗？
Give me a few squirts of
L'air de Panache, please, will you?

783
01:00:15,281 --> 01:00:18,535
- 我连香水都不能喷吗？
- 我把华丽香氛忘了。
- Can I not get a squirt, even?
- I forgot the L'air de Panache.

784
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:21,371
说真的，你没带华丽香氛？
Honestly, you forgot
the L'air de Panache?

785
01:00:21,538 --> 01:00:24,499
难以置信。你怎么能这样？
I don't believe it. How could you?

786
01:00:24,874 --> 01:00:27,836
我可是蹲了大牢，零！你不明白这有多屈辱吗？
I've been in jail, Zero! Do you
understand how humiliating this is?

787
01:00:28,003 --> 01:00:30,005
我身上不好闻。
I smell.

788
01:00:32,007 --> 01:00:33,925
这可真棒，是吧？
That's just marvelous, isn't it?

789
01:00:34,134 --> 01:00:37,887
我想这要是在...你从哪儿来的来着？
I suppose this is to be expected back
in... Where do you come from again?

790
01:00:38,054 --> 01:00:39,472
- 阿克萨利阿-扎巴。
- 对。
- Aq Salim al-Jabat.
- Precisely.

791
01:00:39,848 --> 01:00:42,267
我想这要是在阿克萨利阿-扎巴才会这样，
I suppose this is to be expected
back in Aq Salim al-Jabat

792
01:00:42,434 --> 01:00:43,852
每个人最珍贵的物件
where one's prized possessions

793
01:00:44,019 --> 01:00:45,979
就是一捆脏毯子，还有一头快饿死的羊，
are a stack of filthy carpets
and a starving goat,

794
01:00:46,062 --> 01:00:49,899
人都睡在帐篷里，得靠野枣和圣甲虫才能活。
and one sleeps behind a tent flap and
survives on wild dates and scarabs.

795
01:00:50,066 --> 01:00:52,485
但这不是我教你的。
But it's not how I trained you.

796
01:00:52,861 --> 01:00:54,362
究竟你是着了什么魔，
What on God's earth
possessed you to leave

797
01:00:54,446 --> 01:00:55,966
才会离开你的家乡，而不呆在该呆的地方，
the homeland where
you obviously belong

798
01:00:56,031 --> 01:00:58,950
走了不知多远，才能来这成为一名身无分文的移民。
and travel unspeakable distances
to become a penniless immigrant

799
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:01,077
这个高雅，有教养的社会，
in a refined,
highly-cultivated society

800
01:01:01,286 --> 01:01:04,289
说实话，没你也一样运转得好好的？
that, quite frankly, could've
gotten along very well without you?

801
01:01:05,206 --> 01:01:06,207
战争。
The war.

802
01:01:07,334 --> 01:01:08,585
再说一次？
Say again?

803
01:01:08,918 --> 01:01:10,962
唔，你看，我爸爸被杀害了，
Well, you see, my father was murdered

804
01:01:11,171 --> 01:01:13,631
家里的其他人被射击队处死了。
and the rest of my family were
executed by firing squad.

805
01:01:14,049 --> 01:01:15,489
我的村庄被烧毁，
Our village was burned to the ground

806
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:18,928
那些想办法活下来的人只能逃亡。
and those who managed to
survive were forced to flee.

807
01:01:19,054 --> 01:01:20,930
我是因为战争才离开。
I left because of the war.

808
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:25,477
我明白了。所以你其实，某种程度上，
真的是个难民？
I see. So you're, actually, really
more of a refugee, in that sense?

809
01:01:26,603 --> 01:01:27,604
没错。
Truly.

810
01:01:27,937 --> 01:01:31,524
我想我最好收回刚才我说的一切。
Well, I suppose I'd better take
back everything I just said.

811
01:01:32,901 --> 01:01:35,987
我真是个大傻瓜。
可悲的笨蛋。
What a bloody idiot I am.
Pathetic fool.

812
01:01:36,196 --> 01:01:38,281
该死的自私鬼。
Goddamn, selfish bastard.

813
01:01:38,448 --> 01:01:41,493
这太丢人了，而且远远低于布达佩斯大饭店的准则。
This is disgraceful, and it's beneath
the standards of the Grand Budapest.

814
01:01:43,244 --> 01:01:45,288
我代表饭店向你道歉。
I apologize on behalf of the hotel.

815
01:01:45,455 --> 01:01:47,916
这不是你的错。你只是因为我没带香水才沮丧的。
It's not your fault. You were
just upset I forgot the perfume.

816
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:52,087
别替我找借口。
我欠你一条命。
Don't make excuses for me.
I owe you my life.

817
01:01:52,253 --> 01:01:56,132
你是我的好友，我的宠儿，我真为你骄傲。
You are my dear friend and protégé
and I'm very proud of you.

818
01:01:56,341 --> 01:01:58,551
你一定要知道这点。
You must know that.

819
01:01:58,927 --> 01:02:00,929
我很抱歉，零。
I'm so sorry, Zero.

820
01:02:02,389 --> 01:02:04,391
咱们是兄弟。
We're brothers.

821
01:02:12,524 --> 01:02:14,526
咱们亲爱的阿加莎怎么样？
How's our darling Agatha?

822
01:02:17,112 --> 01:02:20,323
"初见她时，荒原上的第一束光，
"'Twas first light
when I saw her face upon the heath,

823
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:23,159
"让我折返，日复一日，如痴如醉，
"and hence did I return,
day-by-day, entranced,

824
01:02:23,368 --> 01:02:26,287
"你的活力浸满我心，永不..."
"tho' vinegar did brine
my heart, never..."

825
01:02:26,413 --> 01:02:29,165
很好。我得打断你，因为警报响了，
Very good. I'm going to stop you
there because the alarm has sounded,

826
01:02:29,290 --> 01:02:32,669
但是记得我们逃走之后，一定要再说给我听。
but remember where we left off
because I insist you finish later.

827
01:02:50,687 --> 01:02:53,481
我要在50公里内每个路口都设路障。
I want roadblocks
at every junction for 50km.

828
01:02:53,648 --> 01:02:56,401
我要在100公里内每个火车站都设铁路检查。
I want rail blocks
at every train station for 100km.

829
01:02:56,651 --> 01:02:59,529
五分钟内，我要50个人，10条猎犬做好准备。
I want 50 men and 10 bloodhounds
ready in five minutes.

830
01:02:59,654 --> 01:03:03,033
我们要清查每个饼干屋，华夫饼小店，酒吧，
We're going to strip-search every
pretzel<i>-Haus, Waffel-</i>hut, <i>Biergarten</i>

831
01:03:03,158 --> 01:03:06,995
尤其要查从奥根斯堡到兹克布洛克的每个大饭店。
and especially every grand hotel
from Augenzburg to Zilchbrock.

832
01:03:07,245 --> 01:03:09,164
这些逃犯很危险，是专业的罪犯。
These men are dangerous,
professional criminals.

833
01:03:09,372 --> 01:03:11,416
不管怎么说，至少他们中有三个是。
At least three of them are anyway.

834
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:12,584
你是谁？
Who are you?

835
01:03:15,128 --> 01:03:17,714
你在这干嘛？平民不允许进入监狱区。
What are you doing here? Civilian personnel
aren't permitted in the cellblock.

836
01:03:18,006 --> 01:03:21,092
- 这是军事调查。
- 这是杰普林先生，头儿。
- This is a military investigation.
- This is Mr. Jopling, sir.

837
01:03:21,176 --> 01:03:23,345
他雇主的母亲是是受害者之一...
His employer's mother
was one of the victims...

838
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:25,722
闭嘴。
Shut up.

839
01:03:26,723 --> 01:03:29,184
你为戴斯高夫塔克西斯家族工作？
You work for the family
Desgoffe und Taxis?

840
01:03:29,351 --> 01:03:33,313
你知道十月23日维莫斯.卡瓦斯被杀了吗？
Are you aware of the murder of Deputy
Vilmos Kovacs on 23rd October?

841
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,732
我知道他消失了。
I'm aware of his disappearance.

842
01:03:36,149 --> 01:03:38,568
他的尸体在昨晚找到的，被塞在昆斯艺术馆
His body was found stuffed in
a sarcophagus behind a storage room

843
01:03:38,693 --> 01:03:40,320
储藏室的石棺内。
at the Kunstmuseum late last night.

844
01:03:40,528 --> 01:03:43,198
<i>他少了四只手指。</i>
<i>He was short four fingers.</i>

845
01:03:43,365 --> 01:03:46,117
- 你知道点什么嘛？
- 不知道。
- What do you know about that?
- Nothing.

846
01:03:47,619 --> 01:03:49,621
送杰普林先生出去。
Escort Mr. Jopling off the premises.

847
01:04:00,215 --> 01:04:02,217
门德尔家的。
Mendl's.

848
01:04:07,055 --> 01:04:09,224
接线员，请替我接巴登-约根的精益宫，
Operator, get me the Excelsior
Palace in Baden-Jurgen

849
01:04:09,391 --> 01:04:10,809
对方付费。
and reverse the charges, please.

850
01:04:11,184 --> 01:04:13,061
我们没得选了。
没有别人可以求。
We've no choice.
There's nowhere else to turn.

851
01:04:13,228 --> 01:04:14,479
好，我等着。谢谢。
I'll hold. Thank you.

852
01:04:14,604 --> 01:04:17,357
这是我们唯一的希望了。否则，
我都不会向你提及它的存在。
It's our only hope. Otherwise, I shouldn't
even mention its existence to you.

853
01:04:17,524 --> 01:04:20,404
不用说，别向任何一个生灵提起一个字。
It goes without saying, never breathe
a word about this to a living soul.

854
01:04:20,527 --> 01:04:22,447
- 你发誓？
- 我发誓。不过是什么啊？
- Do you swear?
- Of course. What is it, in fact?

855
01:04:22,487 --> 01:04:23,571
我不能告诉你。
I can't say.

856
01:04:26,324 --> 01:04:28,118
一个人是怎样，只花了一天，
How does one come by
front-row aisle seats

857
01:04:28,326 --> 01:04:31,538
就得到托斯塔纳剧院演出
第一晚第一排的通道座位？
for a first night at the Opera
Toscana with one day's notice?

858
01:04:31,663 --> 01:04:33,248
第一个人是怎样安排了皇家萨克森画廊
How does one arrange
a private viewing

859
01:04:33,456 --> 01:04:36,251
挂毯展的私人参观？

at the Royal Saxon Gallery?

860
01:04:36,418 --> 01:04:38,253
一个人是怎样留住星期四
How does one secure a corner table

861
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:40,547
多明尼克的角桌位置？
at Chez Dominique on a Thursday?

862
01:04:40,672 --> 01:04:43,091
艾文，亲爱的，是我古斯塔夫。你好。
Ivan, darling, it's Gustave. Hello.

863
01:04:43,258 --> 01:04:45,260
直到5分钟前还是那样的。
Well, I was until about
five minutes ago.

864
01:04:45,468 --> 01:04:48,555
如果你能明白的话，我们刚才离开得挺匆忙的。
We've taken it upon ourselves to clear
out in a hurry if you see what I mean.

865
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:51,266
唔，碰巧是通过下水道离开的。对的。
Well, through a sewer,
as it happens. Exactly.

866
01:04:51,433 --> 01:04:54,185
听着，艾文，我很抱歉打断你，但我们现在有困难。
Listen, Ivan, I'm sorry to cut you
off, but we're in a bit of a bind.

867
01:04:54,269 --> 01:04:55,812
我正式请求保住。
This is an official request.

868
01:04:56,146 --> 01:04:59,274
我代表特殊服务处，正式与你通话...
I'm formally calling
upon the special services of...

869
01:05:04,487 --> 01:05:05,822
<i>一会儿打给你，古斯塔夫。</i>
<i>I'll call you back, Gustave.</i>

870
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:08,158
对，等着。
Right. Stand by.

871
01:05:08,366 --> 01:05:11,494
不好意思。
您愿意走过去吗？
I beg your pardon.
Do you prefer to walk?

872
01:05:11,661 --> 01:05:13,580
咱们就在这。很简单。
We're right here. It's very simple.

873
01:05:13,788 --> 01:05:15,790
顺着滨海路直走，然后左转。
Straight down the
corniche, then left.

874
01:05:16,124 --> 01:05:18,126
乔乔，陪这位先生出去。
Jojo, see the gentleman out.

罗宾<i>先生</i>。迪诺<i>先生</i>来了电话。

- One, two, three.<i>

请替我接通里兹皇家饭店的马丁<i>先生</i>。
Get me <i>Monsieur </i>Martin
at the Ritz Imperial, please.

893
01:06:19,229 --> 01:06:20,939
盐太多。
Too much salt.

894
01:06:21,231 --> 01:06:24,150
胡椒不够。
Not enough pepper.

895
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:26,361
你来。
Take over.

896
01:06:28,405 --> 01:06:30,490
<i>- 罗宾？我是马丁。</i>
- 盐太多。
<i>- Robin? Martin.</i>
- Too much salt.

897
01:06:30,615 --> 01:06:32,617
我听说了。
So I've heard.

898
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:36,871
也许吧。让我打几个电话。
Maybe. Let me make a few calls.

899
01:06:41,918 --> 01:06:44,504
瑟奇.X，失踪。
卡瓦斯副手，也是失踪。
Serge X, missing.
Deputy Kovacs, also missing.

900
01:06:44,671 --> 01:06:47,549
D夫人，死亡。<i>
拿着苹果的的男孩，</i>被窃，被咱俩。
Madame D, dead.<i>
Boy with Apple, </i>stolen, by us.

901
01:06:47,674 --> 01:06:50,260
迪米崔和杰普林，无情，冷血，野蛮人。
Dmitri and Jopling, ruthless,
cold-blooded savages.

902
01:06:50,427 --> 01:06:53,638
古斯塔夫.H，在逃。还有呢？
Gustave H, at large. What else?

903
01:06:53,763 --> 01:06:56,516
- 零，困惑。
- 零，困惑，没错。
- Zero, confused.
- Zero, confused, indeed.

904
01:06:56,683 --> 01:06:58,810
剧情"变浓重"了，正如他们所说。
The plot "thickens," as they say.

905
01:06:59,227 --> 01:07:01,688
话说为什么呢？
为什么要用形容汤的词呢？
Why, by the way?
Is it a soup metaphor?

906
01:07:01,896 --> 01:07:03,898
我不知道。
I don't know.

907
01:07:08,778 --> 01:07:10,447
进来。
Get in.

908
01:07:12,782 --> 01:07:14,200
我们找到了管家。
We found the butler.

909
01:07:14,409 --> 01:07:17,245
他在嘉宝美斯特峰附近遥远的小山丘里躲着呢。
He's hiding out in the remote
foothills near Gabelmeister's Peak.

910
01:07:17,412 --> 01:07:19,497
我们的联络人说服他与你在明天中午见面。
Our contact convinced him
to meet you midday tomorrow

911
01:07:19,664 --> 01:07:20,985
在封顶的天文台。
at the observatory on the summit.

912
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:23,543
别告诉别人。
他会解释一切的。
Tell no one.
He'll explain everything.

913
01:07:23,793 --> 01:07:25,837
你们的火车在四分半中内开动。
Your train departs
in four and a half minutes.

914
01:07:25,962 --> 01:07:27,505
这是车票。
Here's your tickets.

915
01:07:27,672 --> 01:07:29,841
- 三等舱？
- 票订没了。
- Third class?
- It was overbooked

916
01:07:30,258 --> 01:07:33,720
但是售票员在老凡尔赛做过酒侍。
but the conductor used to be
a sommelier at the old Versailles.

917
01:07:33,845 --> 01:07:34,971
他在背后帮了忙。
He pulled some strings.

918
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:37,432
你在餐车用得上这个。
You'll need these
for the dining car.

919
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:42,312
最后一件事。
One last thing.

920
01:07:43,855 --> 01:07:45,857
华丽香氛。
L'air de Panache.

921
01:07:48,485 --> 01:07:50,612
他们只剩半盎司了。
They only had the half-ounce.

922
01:07:54,824 --> 01:07:56,826
我们至少得和他做做样子。
We should give him something
as a symbolic gesture.

923
01:07:56,993 --> 01:07:59,412
- 你有多少钱？
- 42块钱和三张邮票。
- How much money you got?
- 42 Klubecks and 3 postage stamps.

924
01:07:59,579 --> 01:08:01,581
给我25块。对。
Give me 25. Yes.

925
01:08:05,335 --> 01:08:08,254
- 祝福你。
- 省省吧。
- Bless you.
- Please.

926
01:08:25,021 --> 01:08:26,701
- 我得亲手给他。<i>
- 天啊。</i>
- I've got to hand it to him.<i>
- Jesus Christ.</i>

927
01:08:26,773 --> 01:08:30,610
我没想到。
接下来你想怎么做？
I didn't see that coming.
Well, what do you want next?

928
01:08:30,777 --> 01:08:36,032
<i>和跛脚姑娘再聊一次，这次，要说服她们。</i>
<i>Talk to the club-footed sister again,
and, this time, be persuasive.</i>

929
01:08:43,373 --> 01:08:46,001
该死的混蛋！
Goddamn son of a bitch.

930
01:09:09,649 --> 01:09:11,651
妈的！
Holy fuck!

931
01:09:15,905 --> 01:09:18,825
这什么玩意？
What's the meaning of this shit?

932
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:20,660
<i>拿着苹果的少年？</i>我以为你藏起来了。
<i>Boy with Apple? </i>I thought
you'd hidden it.

933
01:09:20,744 --> 01:09:23,121
- 你怎么现在才提？
- 我以为查税人拿走了。
- Why are you only noticing now?
- I assumed it went to the tax appraiser.

934
01:09:23,496 --> 01:09:27,542
你他妈在逗我？
Are you fucking kidding me?

935
01:09:27,709 --> 01:09:30,545
我想是被古斯塔夫<i>先生</i>拿走了。
I believe it was removed
by <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave.

936
01:09:38,428 --> 01:09:39,512
我不生瑟奇的气。
I'm not angry with Serge.

937
01:09:39,721 --> 01:09:42,098
你不能因为别人没有基本的道德品质
就责怪他们。
You can't blame someone
for their basic lack of moral fiber.

938
01:09:42,432 --> 01:09:44,392
他是个惊慌，矮小，胆怯的懦夫。
He's a frightened, little,
yellow-bellied coward.

939
01:09:44,601 --> 01:09:46,721
- 这不是他的错，对吧？
- 我不知道。要看情况。
- It's not his fault, is it?
- I don't know. It depends.

940
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:48,450
唔，对什么事你都可以这么说。
Well, you can say that
about most anything.

941
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:49,880
"看情况。"当然要看情况。
"It depends." Of course it depends.

942
01:09:49,981 --> 01:09:51,661
当然要看情况。
当然要看情况。
Of course it depends.
Of course it depends.

943
01:09:51,775 --> 01:09:53,860
我觉得你说的没错。
当然要看情况。
Yes, I suppose you're right.
Of course it depends.

944
01:09:54,069 --> 01:09:57,614
这不代表我不会掐死那个小叛徒。
That doesn't mean I'm not going
to throttle the little swamp rat.

945
01:09:59,991 --> 01:10:04,412
顺便一提，我可以主持婚礼吗？
May I officiate, by the way?
The ceremony?

946
01:10:04,621 --> 01:10:05,622
荣幸之至。
With pleasure.

947
01:10:05,747 --> 01:10:08,458
不得不说，那个姑娘真是让人快乐。
I must say, I find that
girl utterly delightful.

948
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:10,043
身子像块平板，半张脸上
Flat as a board, enormous birthmark

949
01:10:10,418 --> 01:10:12,003
有着墨西哥形状的巨大胎记，
the shape of Mexico
over half her face,

950
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:14,506
连续几小时站在闷热的厨房里流汗，
sweating for hours on end
in that sweltering kitchen

951
01:10:14,631 --> 01:10:15,965
而门德尔，真是个天才，
while Mendl, genius though he is,

952
01:10:16,132 --> 01:10:17,759
像只大猩猩似的，傲视她。
looms over her like
a hulking gorilla.

953
01:10:17,967 --> 01:10:20,095
但毫无疑问，毋庸置疑，
Yet without question, without fail,

954
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:23,640
一直不变的是，她太可爱了。
always and invariably,
she's exceedingly lovely.

955
01:10:23,765 --> 01:10:25,016
为什么？
Why?

956
01:10:25,433 --> 01:10:27,894
因为她纯真。
Because of her purity.

957
01:10:29,979 --> 01:10:32,190
她也仰慕你，古斯塔夫<i>先生</i>。
She admires you as well,<i>
Monsieur </i>Gustave.

958
01:10:32,482 --> 01:10:35,068
- 是吗？
- 是的，非常仰慕。
- Does she?
- Very much.

959
01:10:35,485 --> 01:10:39,114
这挺好的，你懂。
这说明她能“明白到点上”。
That's a good sign, you know.
It means she "gets it."

960
01:10:39,489 --> 01:10:41,491
这很重要。
That's important.

961
01:10:43,827 --> 01:10:45,829
不许和她调情。
Don't flirt with her.

962
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:35,086
今早四点，一封电报由一位女孩签名寄出，
A radio telegram was delivered and
signed for by the girl at 4:00 AM.

963
01:11:35,211 --> 01:11:37,964
信封在她尸体附近找到了，但是信不见了。
The envelope was found near the body,
but its contents were missing.

964
01:11:38,757 --> 01:11:41,968
但是，电报局总是保留着24小时内自动收报机纸条的副本。
However, the telegraph office always keeps
a carbon of the ticker tape for 24 hours.

965
01:11:42,052 --> 01:11:44,220
我抄了下来。
内容如下，
I copied it down.
It reads as follows,

966
01:11:45,221 --> 01:11:46,556
"收拾好行李句号。
"Pack your things stop.

967
01:11:46,765 --> 01:11:48,850
"立刻准备离开句号。
"Be ready to leave
at moment's notice stop.

968
01:11:48,975 --> 01:11:51,561
"藏身地在嘉宝美斯特峰附近句号。
"Hide-out is vicinity
of Gabelmeister's Peak stop.

969
01:11:51,728 --> 01:11:54,064
"删除这条信息，我爱你句号。"
"Destroy this message
all my love full stop."

970
01:11:55,106 --> 01:11:56,941
篮子在哪儿？
Where's the basket?

971
01:12:22,217 --> 01:12:24,219
先生，你要去哪儿？
Where you headed, mister?

972
01:12:27,972 --> 01:12:30,225
滑雪？滑雪橇？爬山？
Skiing? Sledding? Mountain climbing?

973
01:12:40,026 --> 01:12:41,986
三块钱。
Three Klubecks.

974
01:12:52,122 --> 01:12:53,915
<i>通过无线电，我给阿加莎写信，</i>
<i>By express wireless, I wrote Agatha</i>

975
01:12:54,124 --> 01:12:56,918
<i>指示她前往我们预先安排好的藏身处，</i>
<i>with instructions to move
to our pre-arranged hideout,</i>

976
01:12:57,043 --> 01:12:59,629
<i>就在那不勒堡路外头的吉卜赛拖车里，</i>

这景色真好。它配得上这种夸奖。
It's a hell of a view. I give
them that, for what's it's worth.

01:15:58,099 --> 01:15:59,934
我是无罪的。
I'm innocent.

嗯？不对不对。
Hmm? No, no.

Forgive me, <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave.
I never meant to betray you.

They threatened my life and now
they've murdered my only family.

999
01:16:17,369 --> 01:16:19,037

亲爱的，我知道。过去的就过去了吧。
I know, darling. Let's
put that behind us.

I was the official witness
in Madame D's presence

1008
01:16:37,013 --> 01:16:38,473
见证她撰写第二份遗嘱，
to the creation of a second will

1009
01:16:38,848 --> 01:16:41,893
这份遗嘱只能在她被谋杀的情况下执行。
to be executed only in the event
of her death by murder.

1010
01:16:42,018 --> 01:16:43,436

What does it say? Where is it?
What's it all about, dammit?

1018

别卖关子了。这他妈完全成了个噩梦。
Don't keep us in suspense. This has
been a complete fucking nightmare.

Just tell us what the
fuck is going on!

他们把这个倒霉蛋勒死了。
Bloody hell.
They've strangled the poor slob.

1022
01:17:44,164 --> 01:17:45,165
来吧！我们走！
Come on! Let's go!

1023
01:17:53,131 --> 01:17:55,300
- 如果抓到他，我们该怎么办？
- 我不知道。
- What do we do if we catch him?
- I don't know.

1024
01:17:55,467 --> 01:17:57,886
他是个杀人狂魔。咱们别追了。
He's a homicidal psychopath.
Let's stop.

1025
01:17:58,094 --> 01:18:00,305
我停不下来。我快掌不住舵了。
I can't. I can barely steer.

1026
01:19:08,164 --> 01:19:11,668
你这个恶心，可悲的讨厌鬼。
我恨死你了。
You sick, pathetic creep.
I hate you.

cried the wounded piper-boy,

"And the ramparts fell.

"'我想我最后嗅到的，是我的恐惧'
他说道..."
"'Methinks me breathes me last,
me fears!' said he..."

1031
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:41,197
天啊！你成功了！
Holy shit! You got him!

1032
01:19:41,406 --> 01:19:43,324
干得好！零！
Well done, Zero!

<i>不要尝试逃跑！</i>
<i>Do not attempt to flee!</i>

1037
01:20:02,761 --> 01:20:04,346
- 你怎么想？
- 我不知道。
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

1038
01:20:04,471 --> 01:20:07,390
我宁愿现在从悬崖跳下去，也不回那个破监狱了。
I'd rather jump off this cliff right now
than go back to fucking prison.

1039
01:20:07,599 --> 01:20:10,101
我的看法是，咱们偷走那个死疯子的摩托车，
接上阿加莎，
I say we steal that sick maniac's
motorcycle, go fetch Agatha,

1040
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:13,310
取回<i>拿着苹果的男孩，</i>，朝着马耳他海滨跑，
一劳永逸。
take back <i>Boy with Apple </i>and head for
the Maltese Riviera, once and for all.

很好！你太棒了，零。
谢谢。
Very good! You're so extraordinary, Zero.

Let's put him in the

with a package under her arm

1079
01:23:35,557 --> 01:23:36,757

in the last minute and a half?

- Otto, sir, the new Lobby Boy.
- You haven't been trained properly.

1084
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:48,945
门童才不应该提供那样的信息。
A Lobby Boy never provides
information of that kind.

1085
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:51,406
你就是一堵墙。懂了吗？

01:25:43,435 --> 01:25:45,854
那是古斯塔夫.H！逃逸的杀人犯和艺术品窃贼！
That's Gustave H!
The escaped murderer and art thief.

1096
01:25:46,021 --> 01:25:47,147
我已经把他逼到绝路了！
I've got him cornered!

1097
01:25:47,522 --> 01:25:48,857
那是迪米崔.戴斯高夫塔克西斯！
That's Dmitri Desgoffe und Taxis!

1098
01:25:49,024 --> 01:25:51,026
他杀了卡瓦斯副手，
He's responsible for the killing
of Deputy Kovacs,

1099
01:25:51,359 --> 01:25:54,029
瑟奇.X和他的跛脚姐姐，在加上他自己的妈妈！
Serge X and his club-footed sister,
plus his own mother!

1100
01:25:55,697 --> 01:25:57,824
谁也别动。
你们都要被抓起来。
Nobody move.
Everybody's under arrest.

1101
01:25:59,159 --> 01:26:01,578
窗户外的是谁？
Who's out the window?

1102
01:26:01,703 --> 01:26:03,705
阿加莎！
Agatha!

1103
01:26:09,878 --> 01:26:10,920
310-bis.

1104
01:26:11,046 --> 01:26:12,464
撑住！我来了!
Hang on! Here I come!

1105
01:26:37,572 --> 01:26:39,574
背面有什么东西...
Something's on the back of the...

1106
01:26:45,163 --> 01:26:46,164
阿加莎!
Agatha!

1107
01:26:46,498 --> 01:26:48,083
阿加莎！
Agatha!

1108
01:26:48,416 --> 01:26:50,418
- 你没事吧？
- 我没事。
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

1109
01:26:51,961 --> 01:26:53,922
画的背面有东西。
Something's on the
back of the picture.

1110
01:27:07,435 --> 01:27:10,063
她当然把一切都留给了古斯塔夫<i>先生</i>。
<i>She left everything
to </i>Monsieur <i>Gustave, of course.</i>

1111
01:27:12,065 --> 01:27:14,526
<i>那座大宅，也就是路兹城，</i>
<i>The mansion, known as Schloss Lutz,</i>

1112
01:27:15,944 --> 01:27:19,030
<i>生产武器，药品和织物的工厂，</i>
<i>the factories, which produced
weapons, medicine and textiles,</i>

1113
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:23,702
<i>一个重要的报社集团，</i>
<i>an important newspaper syndicate,</i>

1114
01:27:24,828 --> 01:27:27,205
<i>还有估计你们已经猜到的，</i>
<i>and perhaps you've already deduced</i>

1115
01:27:27,455 --> 01:27:32,043
<i>这座有名的，布达佩斯大饭店。</i>
<i>this very institution,
the Grand Budapest Hotel.</i>

1116
01:27:33,586 --> 01:27:35,005
<i>他指定我作为他的继承人，</i>
<i>He anointed me his successor,</i>

1117
01:27:35,130 --> 01:27:38,049
<i>战火未熄，我报效祖国，</i>
<i>and as the war continued,
I served my adopted country</i>

1118
01:27:38,216 --> 01:27:42,679
<i>在这张窄窄的桌前，对着隔壁屋子的墙工作。</i>
<i>from the narrow desk still found
against the wall in the next room.</i>

1119
01:27:42,971 --> 01:27:45,056
<i>他和他的信徒一样，</i>
<i>He was the same as his disciples,</i>

1120
01:27:45,223 --> 01:27:48,685
<i>缺乏安全感，虚荣，肤浅，金发，欲求不满。</i>
<i>insecure, vain,
superficial, blond, needy.</i>

1121
01:27:49,561 --> 01:27:51,730
<i>到最后，他甚至变成了富翁。</i>
<i>In the end he was even rich.</i>

1122
01:27:53,023 --> 01:27:56,151
<i>然而，他却没有继续变老。</i>
<i>He did not succeed, however,
in growing old.</i>

1123
01:28:00,989 --> 01:28:02,907
"亲爱的诸位，我们聚集在此..."
"Dearly beloved,
we are gathered together..."

1124
01:28:03,033 --> 01:28:04,909
<i>我亲爱的阿加莎也没有。</i>
<i>Nor did my darling Agatha.</i>

1125
01:28:05,118 --> 01:28:07,537
<i>我们的儿子，会在两年后，</i>
<i>She and our infant son
would be killed two years later</i>

1126
01:28:07,704 --> 01:28:10,582
<i>死于普鲁士流感。一种小到荒谬的疾病。</i>
<i>by the Prussian grippe.
An absurd little disease.</i>

1127
01:28:10,749 --> 01:28:15,920
<i>现在看来不过一个星期的事，
在那时，成千上万的人却死于这短短七天。</i>
<i>Today we treat it in a single week,
but, in those days many millions died.</i>

1128
01:28:19,174 --> 01:28:21,051
<i>在工作的第21天，</i>
<i>On the 21st day of the occupation,</i>

1129
01:28:21,176 --> 01:28:23,970
<i>那天早上，朱波罗卡正式的，</i>
<i>the morning
the independent state of Zubrowka</i>

1130
01:28:24,137 --> 01:28:25,263
<i>不再作为独立国家存在，</i>
<i>officially ceased to exist,</i>

1131
01:28:25,597 --> 01:28:27,599
<i>我们和古斯塔夫</i>先生<i>去路兹旅行。</i>
<i>we traveled
with </i>Monsieur <i>Gustave to Lutz.</i>

1132
01:28:27,724 --> 01:28:29,934
顺便说一句，你之前问题的答案是，
In answer to your earlier question,
by the way,

1133
01:28:30,143 --> 01:28:32,020
当然。
of course.

1134
01:28:33,855 --> 01:28:36,733
零曾经问我，我是怎样卑微的进入了饭店行业。
Zero asked me about my humble
beginnings in the hotel trade.

1135
01:28:36,858 --> 01:28:39,110
我曾经也许一度是
I was, perhaps, for a time,
considered the best Lobby Boy

1136
01:28:39,319 --> 01:28:41,821
布达佩斯大饭店最好的门童。
we'd ever had at the Grand Budapest.

1137
01:28:42,030 --> 01:28:43,573
我想可以这么说。
I think I can say that.

1138
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:45,617
总算有一位做得比我好的了。
This one finally surpassed me.

1139
01:28:45,784 --> 01:28:48,745
但必须一提，他有位优秀的老师。
Although, I must say,
he had an exceptional teacher.

1140
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:49,996
是的。
Truly.

1141
01:28:55,210 --> 01:28:58,171
"这两位面泛潮红，天上的生子，从何而来，
"Whence came these two
radiant, celestial brothers,

1142
01:28:58,546 --> 01:28:59,798
"一瞬，合为一体，
"united, for an instant,

1143
01:28:59,964 --> 01:29:04,177
"当他们穿越我们窗外，
星光闪闪的高空时吗？
"as they crossed the stratosphere
of our starry window?

1144
01:29:04,344 --> 01:29:07,180
"一位从东而来，一位从西。"
"One from the East
and one from the West."

1145
01:29:07,305 --> 01:29:09,099
很好。
Very good.

1146
01:29:09,307 --> 01:29:11,309
不许和她调情。
Don't flirt with her.

1147
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:15,980
我们为什么又在麦地停下了？
Why are we stopping
at a barley field again?

1148
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:27,325
我觉得这些穿黑制服的很是死气沉沉。
I find these black
uniforms very drab.

1149
01:29:31,955 --> 01:29:34,916
唔，你们好啊，小伙子们。
我们正谈到你们呢。
Well, hello there, chaps.
We were just talking about you.

1150
01:29:35,125 --> 01:29:38,920
- 请出示证件。
- 永远荣幸之至。
- Documents, please.
- With pleasure, as always.

1151
01:29:43,258 --> 01:29:45,093
你们是第一批让我们正式
You're the first of the
official death squads

1152
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:47,679
自我介绍的射击队。
to whom we've been
formally introduced.

1153
01:29:47,804 --> 01:29:49,806
你们好吗？
How do you do?

1154
01:29:50,974 --> 01:29:53,018
<i>万变不离其宗，</i>我说的没错吧？
<i>Plus ?§a change, </i>am I right?

1155
01:29:57,397 --> 01:30:00,900
那是三阶工人身份的移民签证，亲爱的。
That's a migratory visa with
stage three worker status, darling.

1156
01:30:01,109 --> 01:30:02,110
读一读。
Read this.

1157
01:30:11,369 --> 01:30:14,247
- 出来。
- 别动。
- Come outside.
- Now, stay there.

1158
01:30:16,416 --> 01:30:18,835
我向你保证，如果你动了他一根手指头，
I give you my word,
if you lay a finger on this man,

1159
01:30:19,002 --> 01:30:21,129
你会被不光彩地踢出部队。
I'll see you
dishonorably discharged,

1160
01:30:21,338 --> 01:30:24,424
锁在栅栏里，日落时就绞死。
locked up in the stockade
and hanged by sundown.

1161
01:30:25,842 --> 01:30:27,719
<i>微弱的文明之光，</i>
<i>There are still faint
glimmers of civilization</i>

1162
01:30:27,844 --> 01:30:32,140
<i>仍存留在这野蛮的屠场里，这就是人性。</i>
<i>left in this barbaric slaughterhouse
that was once known as humanity.</i>

1163
01:30:35,185 --> 01:30:38,938
你们这些肮脏的，该死的，满脸麻子的法西斯混蛋！
You filthy, goddamn,
pock-marked, fascist assholes!

1164
01:30:40,023 --> 01:30:42,776
<i>他是他们中的一员。</i>
<i>He was one of them.</i>

1165
01:30:42,901 --> 01:30:44,903
<i>还能说些什么呢？</i>
<i>What more is there to say?</i>

1166
01:30:52,452 --> 01:30:55,163
最后发生了什么？
What happened in the end?

1167
01:30:55,330 --> 01:30:57,332
最后他们把他射杀了。
In the end they shot him.

1168
01:30:59,167 --> 01:31:01,169
所以这一切，都归我了。
So it all went to me.

1169
01:31:10,053 --> 01:31:13,264
<i>晚餐后，我们去领房间的钥匙，</i>
<i>After dinner, we went to collect
the keys to our rooms,</i>

1170
01:31:13,431 --> 01:31:15,308
<i>但简</i>先生<i>已经擅离职守了。</i>
<i>but </i>Monsieur <i>Jean had
abandoned his post.</i>

1171
01:31:15,433 --> 01:31:17,769
我猜他把咱们都忘了。
I expect he's forgotten
all about us.

1172
01:31:17,936 --> 01:31:19,020
<i>近年来，</i>
<i>In recent years, of course,</i>

1173
01:31:19,187 --> 01:31:21,398
<i>像布达佩斯大饭店这样的私有财产，</i>
<i>such properties and holdings
as the Grand Budapest</i>

1174
01:31:21,773 --> 01:31:25,235
<i>几乎无一例外，移交公有。</i>
<i>had with very few exceptions
become common property.</i>

1175
01:31:26,236 --> 01:31:28,279
<i>既然他与新政府协商的准确条文，</i>
<i>While the precise terms
of his negotiation</i>

1176
01:31:28,446 --> 01:31:30,366
<i>从未公开，</i>
<i>with the new government
had never been announced,</i>

1177
01:31:30,740 --> 01:31:31,940
<i>这也就成了公开的秘密，</i>
<i>the result was an open secret,</i>

1178
01:31:32,784 --> 01:31:35,370
<i>那就是，零.穆斯塔法用巨额财产，</i>
<i>Zero Moustafa had traded
a great and important fortune</i>

1179
01:31:35,745 --> 01:31:40,000
<i>购买了一座昂贵的，不再盈利的，破败饭店。</i>
<i>in exchange for one costly,
unprofitable, doomed hotel.</i>

1180
01:31:41,001 --> 01:31:42,002
<i>为什么？</i>
<i>Why?</i>

1181
01:31:42,210 --> 01:31:44,254
<i>仅仅是出于感伤吗？</i>
<i>Was it merely sentimental?</i>

1182
01:31:44,421 --> 01:31:48,216
<i>这有点超出我应该知道的范围，
也不符合我的性格，</i>
<i>It was quite forward of me
and a bit out of character,</i>

1183
01:31:48,341 --> 01:31:50,218
<i>但我想为了我的健康，</i>
<i>but I felt I must know,</i>

1184
01:31:50,427 --> 01:31:52,429
<i>我必须知道。</i>
<i>for my health, I suppose.</i>

1185
01:31:55,098 --> 01:31:57,267
恕我一问。我希望这问题不会让你心烦。
Forgive me for asking.
I hope I haven't upset you.

1186
01:31:57,434 --> 01:31:59,436
不，当然不会。
No, of course not.

1187
01:32:00,478 --> 01:32:03,356
这仅仅是你和那个消逝的世界最后的联系，
Is it simply your last connection
to that vanished world,

1188
01:32:03,481 --> 01:32:05,942
还是和他的世界的联系呢？
在你看来？
his world, if you will?

1189
01:32:06,109 --> 01:32:07,861
他的世界？
His world?

1190
01:32:08,111 --> 01:32:11,114
不，我不这样认为。
No, I don't think so.

1191
01:32:11,239 --> 01:32:13,324
你看，我们的职业相同。
You see, we shared a vocation.

1192
01:32:13,491 --> 01:32:15,243
那没什么必要。
It wouldn't have been necessary.

1193
01:32:15,452 --> 01:32:20,206
我是为阿加莎保留这座饭店的。
No. The hotel I keep for Agatha.

1194
01:32:21,541 --> 01:32:22,959
我们在这里很快乐。
We were happy here.

1195
01:32:23,126 --> 01:32:25,128
哪怕就那么一会儿。
For a little while.

1196
01:32:30,425 --> 01:32:32,844
说实话，我想他的世界早在他涉足前，
To be frank, I think
his world had vanished

1197
01:32:33,011 --> 01:32:34,929
便已经消失殆尽。
long before he ever entered it.

1198
01:32:35,138 --> 01:32:36,556
但，在我看来，
But, I will say,

1199
01:32:36,931 --> 01:32:40,352
是肯定用神奇的光辉，留住了那份幻象。
he certainly sustained the illusion
with a marvelous grace.

1200
01:32:41,978 --> 01:32:44,147
- 你要上去吗？
- 不了，我想坐一会儿。
- Are you going up?
- No, I'll sit for a little while.

1201
01:32:44,314 --> 01:32:46,274
晚安。
Good night.

1202
01:32:51,488 --> 01:32:52,572
<i>接下来的星期，</i>
<i>The next week,</i>

1203
01:32:52,906 --> 01:32:55,075
<i>我坐船去南美治疗，</i>
<i>I sailed for a cure in South America</i>

1204
01:32:55,283 --> 01:32:57,952
<i>开始了在国外长时间的漫游。</i>
<i>and began a long,
wandering journey abroad.</i>

1205
01:32:58,161 --> 01:33:01,039
<i>很多年，我都不曾回到欧洲。</i>
<i>I did not return to
Europe for many years.</i>

1206
01:33:06,044 --> 01:33:08,421
<i>那是一片迷人的废墟。</i>
<i>It was an enchanting old ruin.</i>
