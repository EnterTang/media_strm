1
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,160
All right, Charlie.

2
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:28,410
- That the joint? Who runs it?
- I already told you.

3
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,750
- Refresh my memory.
- Spats Colombo.

4
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,210
- What's the password?
- "I've come to Grandma's funeral."

5
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,510
- Your admission card.
- Thanks, Charlie.

6
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:40,130
If you want a ringside table,
just say you're a pallbearer.

7
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,300
We're all set. Whens the kickoff?

8
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,560
I'd better blow.
If Colombo sees me, it's goodbye, Charlie.

9
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,770
Goodbye, Charlie.

10
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,230
Give me five minutes,
then hit 'em with everything you got.

11
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,400
You betcha.

12
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,960
Good evening, sir.

13
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,750
- I'm Mr Mozarella. What can I do for you?
- I've come to the old lady's funeral.

14
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,260
I haven't seen you at our services before.

15
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,630
- No, I've been on the wagon.
- Please.

16
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,390
Where is the wake?
I'm one of the pallbearers.

17
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,470
Show the gentleman into the chapel.
Pew number three.

18
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,060
Yes, Mr Mozarella. This way, sir.

19
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,790
Well, if you gotta go,
that's the way to do it.

20
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,160
Follow me, please.

21
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,550
- What'll it be, sir?
- Booze.

22
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,930
- Sorry. We only serve coffee.
- Coffee?

23
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,980
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee,
sour mash coffee...

24
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,890
Scotch. Make it a demitasse,
with soda on the side.

25
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,690
Wait a minute. Haven't you got
a pew not so close to the band?

26
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,780
How about that one over there?

27
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,950
Sorry, but that's reserved
for members of the immediate family.

28
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,460
Oops.

29
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,340
Hey, I want another cup of coffee.

30
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,140
I want another cup of coffee.

31
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,440
Better bring a check
in case the joint is raided.

32
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:04,860
- Who's gonna raid a funeral?
- Some people don't respect the dead.

33
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,930
Say, Joe. Tonight's the night, isn't it?

34
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,600
- I'll say.
- No, tonight we get paid.

35
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:38,350
- Why?
- I've got to see a dentist tomorrow.

36
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,440
You wanna blow
your first week's pay on your teeth?

37
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:45,400
Just a filling. Doesn't have to be gold.

38
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:49,950
How can you be so selfish? We owe rent.
We owe $89 to Moe's Delicatessen.

39
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:54,370
The Chinese laundry is suing us.
We owe money to every girl in the line.

40
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,580
You're right. Tomorrow we'll pay
everyone something on account.

41
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:03,880
No. Tomorrow we go to the dog track
and bet it all on Greased Lightning.

42
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,760
- You'd bet my money on a dog?
- He's a shoo-in.

43
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,010
Max the waiter knows the electrician
that wires the rabbit.

44
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,890
- What are you givin' me with a rabbit?
- The odds are 10 to 1.

45
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,730
- Suppose he loses.
- Why worry? This job'll last a long time.

46
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:21,900
- Suppose it doesn't.
- Jerry boy, why paint everyzhing black?

47
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:26,610
Suppose you got hit by a truck.
Suppose the stock market crashes.

48
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,660
Suppose Mary Pickford
divorces Douglas Fairbanks.

49
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,700
Suppose the Dodgers leave Brooklyn.

50
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,830
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows.

51
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,710
Well, don't look now,
but the whole town is underwater.

52
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,760
Four,

53
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,310
three,

54
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,850
two,

55
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,140
one.

56
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:13,660
All right, everybody. This is a raid.

57
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,740
I'm a federal agent.
You're all under arrest.

58
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,330
I want another cup of coffee.

59
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,840
All right, Spats.

60
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,720
- The services are over. Let's go.
- Go where?

61
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:40,890
A country club for retired bootleggers.
I'm puttin' you up for membership.

62
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,020
- I don't join nothin'.
- Oh, you'll like it there.

63
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:48,780
I'll get the prison tailor to fit you
with a pair of special spats-striped.

64
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,990
Big joke. What's the rap this time?

65
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:56,330
Embalming people with coffee. 86 proof.

66
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,490
Me? I'm just a customer.

67
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:04,130
Oh, come on, Spats. We know you own
the joint. Mozarella's just frontin' for you.

68
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,550
- Mozarella? Never heard of him.
- We got different information.

69
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,550
From who? Toothpick Charlie maybe?

70
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,470
Toothpick Charlie? Never heard of him.

71
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,390
Buttermilk.

72
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,180
Too smart to drink your own stuff, huh?

73
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:25,310
Come on. On your feet.

74
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,360
- You're wastin' the taxpayers' money.
- Call your lawyer if you wanna.

75
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,360
These are my lawyers. All Harvard men.

76
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,580
I wan' another cuppa coffee.

77
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:25,500
That solves one problem. Now we don't
have to worry about who to pay first.

78
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,500
- Quiet. I'm thinking.
- The landlady will lock us out.

79
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,250
At Moe's Deli no
more knockwurst on credit.

80
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,760
We can't borrow from the girls -
they're on the way to jail.

81
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,260
I wonder how much Sam the bookie
will give us for our overcoats.

82
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:43,060
Sam the bookie? Nothin' doin'.
You're not puttin' my overcoat on a dog.

83
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,270
- Jerry, I told you, it's a sure thing.
- We will freeze.

84
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,850
It is below zero. We'll get pneumonia.

85
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,690
Look, stupid, he's 10-1.
Tomorrow we'll have 20 overcoats.

86
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,750
Greased Lightning.

87
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:08,710
- I oughta have my head examined.
- I thought you weren't talkin' to me.

88
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:12,170
The bull fiddle's
dressed warmer than I am.

89
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,720
- Anyzhing today?
- Nothing.

90
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,470
Thank you.

91
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,810
- Anyzhing today?
- Nothing.

92
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,560
Thank you.

93
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:33,070
I can't go on, Joe. I'm weak from hunger,
I got a fever, I got a hole in my shoe...

94
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,990
If you gave me a chance,
we could be living like kings.

95
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,280
- How?
- There's a dog running in the third.

96
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,910
Galloping Ghost. He's 1 5-1 and it's
his kind of a track. He's a real mudder.

97
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,660
What do you want from me?
My head on a plate?

98
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,580
No, your bass.
If we hock that and my sax...

99
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:52,420
Are you crazy? We're up the creek
and you wanna hock the paddle.

100
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,630
All right, go ahead and starve.
What do I care? Freeze.

101
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,470
- Anyzhing today?
- Oh, it's you.

102
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,590
Well, you've got a lot of nerve.

103
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,680
Thank you.

104
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,850
Joe. Come back here.

105
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,480
Nellie, baby, if it's about Saturday night,
I can explain.

106
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,860
What a heel. I spend $4
to get my hair marcelled,

107
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,030
I buy me a brand-new negligee,

108
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,280
I bake him a great big pizza pie.

109
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,410
- And where were you?
- Where were you?

110
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,780
- With you.
- Me?

111
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,870
Remember? You had this bad tooth.

112
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,210
It was impacted. His jaw was swoll out.

113
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,410
It was?

114
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,580
Oh, yeah.

115
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:36,210
- I took him for a blood transfusion.
- We have the same type blood.

116
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,130
- Type O.
- Oh?

117
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,300
- I'll make it up to you.
- You're makin' it up pretty good so far.

118
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:47,890
As soon as we get a job, I'll take you
to the swellest restaurant in town.

119
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:51,850
How about it? Has Poliakoff got
anyzhing for us? We're desperate.

120
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,650
Well, it just so happens
he is looking for a bass.

121
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,480
And a sax.

122
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,150
Right?

123
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,700
Right.

124
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,660
- What's the job?
- Three weeks in Florida.

125
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:07,700
At the Seminole-Ritz in Miami.
Transportation and expenses all paid.

126
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,000
Isn't she a bit of terrific?
Let's see Poliakoff.

127
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,750
- He's busy. You'll have to wait, boys.
- All right, we'll wait.

128
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,420
Look, Gladys, it's three weeks in Florida.

129
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,960
Sweet Sue and her Society Syncopators.

130
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:23,260
They need a couple of girls
on sax and bass.

131
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:27,180
Whaddaya mean, who is it?
It's Poliakoff. I got a job for ya.

132
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,020
Gladys. Are ya there?

133
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,390
Gladys!

134
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,650
Meshugeneh.
Played 1 1 2 hours at a marathon dance.

135
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:38,110
- Now she's in bed with nervous collapse.
- Tell her to move over.

136
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,820
And Cora Jackson?

137
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,450
Last I heard, she was playin'
with the Salvation Army.

138
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,620
Drexel 9044.

139
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,780
Those idiot broads.

140
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:51,700
Here we are, packed and ready to leave
for Miami, and what happens?

141
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:57,130
The sax runs off with a Bible salesman
and the bass gets pregnant.

142
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,210
Bienstock, I oughta fire you.

143
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,590
Me? I'm the manager,
not the night watchman.

144
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,380
Hello. Let me talk to Bessie Malone.

145
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:08,050
What's she doing in Philadelphia?

146
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,560
On the level?

147
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,480
Bessie let her hair grow
and is playing with Stokowski.

148
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,310
- Black Bottom Bessie?
- Schpielt zich mit der Philharmonic.

149
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,440
How about Rosemary Schultz?

150
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,690
Slashed her wrists when Valentino died.

151
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,570
We might as well do the same
if we don't find two dames by tonight.

152
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,120
We don't care where you find them.
Just get them on that train by 8 o'clock.

153
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,160
The moment anyzhing turns up,
I'll give you a tinkle.

154
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:37,080
Bye, Sig. I wonder
if I've got room for another ulcer.

155
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,500
Nellie, get me long-distance.

156
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:44,050
- Sig, we wanna talk to you.
- About the Florida job.

157
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,590
- Nellie told us about it.
- Not too late, are we?

158
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,100
What are ya? Comedians? Get out.

159
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,060
The William Morris Agency in New York.

160
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,850
- You need a bass and a sax?
- The instruments are right but you're not.

161
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,440
I wanna speak to Mr Morris.

162
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,110
- What's wrong with us?
- You're the wrong shape.

163
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:04,400
- What do you want? Hunchbacks?
- It's not the backs that worry me.

164
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,990
What kind of a band is it?

165
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,410
- You gotta be under 25.
- We could pass for that.

166
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,160
- And blond.
- We could dye our hair.

167
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,620
And you gotta be girls.

168
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,910
No, we couldn't.

169
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,160
- Mr William Morris.
- You mean this is a girls' band?

170
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:19,830
Yeah. Good old Nellie.
I could wring her neck.

171
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,340
Let's talk this over. Why couldn't we do it?

172
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,670
When we worked in the gypsy tearoom,
we wore gold earrings.

173
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,140
When you booked us with
the Hawaiian band, we wore grass skirts.

174
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:32,390
- What's with him? He drinks?
- No, he ain't eatin' so good.

175
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,640
His empty stomach has gone to his head.

176
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,770
Joe, three weeks in Florida. We could
borrow clothes from the chorus girls.

177
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:42,190
- You've flipped your wig.
- Now you're talking.

178
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,940
We get second-hand wigs, a little padding.

179
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,570
We call ourselves
Josephine and Geraldine.

180
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,030
Josephine and Geraldine... Come on.

181
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,620
If you wanna pick up
a little money tonight,

182
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,830
at the University of Illinois
they're havin' a St Valentine's dance.

183
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,500
We'll take it.

184
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,460
$6 a man. Be on the campus
at Urbana at 8 o'clock.

185
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:05,250
All the way to Urbana
for a one-night stand?

186
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,470
It's $12. We can get
one of the overcoats out of hock.

187
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:12,220
Hello. Mr Morris?
This is Poliakoff in Chicago.

188
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:15,180
You don't have two girl musicians
available, do you?

189
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,890
A sax player and a bass?

190
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,810
- If William Morris doesn't come through...
- Come on, Geraldine.

191
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,030
It's 100 miles. It's snowin' outside.
How do we get there?

192
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,030
- I'll find something.
- Like what?

193
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,530
Don't crowd me.

194
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,240
- How'd it go, girls?
- I oughta wring your neck.

195
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,080
Please, Jerry. That's no way to talk.

196
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,290
Nellie baby, what are you doin' tonight?

197
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:44,130
- Tonight? Why?
- Cos I've got some plans.

198
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,760
- I'm not doing anything.
- Really?

199
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,010
I just thought I'd go home
and have some cold pizza.

200
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,180
Then you'll be in all evening?

201
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,100
Yes, Joe.

202
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,350
Good. Then you won't
be needing your car.

203
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,520
My car? Why, you...

204
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,110
Isn't he a bit of terrific?

205
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,790
We coulda had three weeks
in Florida, all expenses paid.

206
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:21,580
Lyin' in the sun, palm trees, flyin' fish...

207
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,750
Knock it off, will ya?

208
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,130
Possible straight, possible nothing,
and a pair of eights.

209
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,260
All right, drop 'em, you guys.

210
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,680
- Drop what?
- We came for a car.

211
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,390
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Nellie Weinmeyer's car.

212
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,520
Musicians.

213
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,060
Wise guys.

214
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,650
OK, let's go. Aces bet.

215
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,700
It's a '25 Hupmobile, green, coupe... sir.

216
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,160
- It's over here.
- Yeah, over here.

217
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,290
- Want some gas?
- Yeah, about 40 cents' worth, please.

218
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:03,830
- Put it on Miss Weinmeyer's bill?
- Yeah. Why not?

219
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,580
And while you're at it, fill it up.

220
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:18,680
All right, everybody. Hands up.

221
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,850
Face the wall.

222
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,360
You too, Toothpick.

223
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,520
Come on.

224
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,320
Come on.

225
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,580
Hey. Join us.

226
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,180
OK, boss.

227
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,110
Hello, Charlie. Long time no see.

228
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,280
- Spats, what are you doin' here?
- I just dropped in to pay my respects.

229
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,870
- You don't owe me nothin'.
- I wouldn't say that.

230
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,580
You recommended
my mortuary to your friends.

231
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:29,170
- I don't know what you mean.
- Now I got all those coffins on my hands.

232
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:32,840
- I hate to see 'em go to waste.
- I had nothin' to do with it.

233
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,010
Too bad, Charlie.
You woulda had three eights.

234
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,720
- Goodbye, Charlie.
- No, Spats, no.

235
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,890
No, Spats. Please, no.

236
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,610
I think I'm gonna be sick.

237
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,830
All right, come on outta there.

238
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,540
Come on.

239
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,040
Come on.

240
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,830
- We didn't see anyzhing. Did we?
- What? No. Not a thing.

241
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,880
Besides, it's none of our business
if you guys wanna bump each other off.

242
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,220
Say... Don't I know you two
from somewhere?

243
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,010
Oh, no. We're just a couple of musicians.

244
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,890
We came to pick up a car.
Nellie Weinmeyer's car.

245
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,060
There's a dance tonight.

246
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,560
- Come on, Jerry.
- Wait a minute.

247
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:35,150
- Where do you think you're goin'?
- Urbana. It's about 100 miles from here...

248
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,240
You're not goin' nowhere.

249
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,620
- We're not?
- I don't like no witnesses.

250
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,120
- We won't breathe a word.
- You won't breathe nothin'.

251
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,290
Not even air.

252
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:25,450
All right, boys, let's blow out of here.
We'll take care of those guys later.

253
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,300
I think they got me.

254
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,630
- They got the bull fiddle.
- No blood?

255
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,260
If they catch us, there'll be blood
all over. Type O. Come on.

256
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,030
- Where are you running?
- As far away as possible.

257
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:07,870
It's not far enough. Those guys know us.
Every hood in Chicago will be after us.

258
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,550
Quick, gimme a nickel.

259
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,260
You're gonna call the police?

260
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,850
We'd never live to testify
against Spats Colombo.

261
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,560
We gotta get out of town.
We could grow beards.

262
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,230
We will get out of town,
but we're gonna shave.

263
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,070
At a time like this? They wanna blast
our heads off, and you wanna shave.

264
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,570
- Shave our legs, stupid.
- Shave our legs...?

265
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,160
Hello. Mr Poliakoff?

266
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,910
I understand you're looking
for a couple of girl musicians.

267
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,680
Florida Limited leaving
on track one for Washington,

268
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:16,100
Charleston, Savannah,
Jacksonville and Miami.

269
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,690
All aboard.

270
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,200
What now?

271
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,160
How do they keep their
balance in these things?

272
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,200
Must be the way the weight
is distributed. Now come on.

273
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,370
It is so draughty.

274
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,540
They must catch cold all the time.

275
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:42,630
- Quit stalling. We'll miss the train.
- I feel naked.

276
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:47,010
- I feel like everybody's starin' at me.
- With those legs? Are you crazy?

277
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,440
It's no use. We're not gonna
get away with it, Joe.

278
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,400
My name is Josephine, and this was
your idea in the first place.

279
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:29,840
Look at that. Look how she moves.

280
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,600
That's just like Jell-O on springs.

281
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,020
They must have some sort of
built-in motor or something.

282
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,350
I tell ya, it's a whole different sex.

283
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,150
Nobody's asking you to have a baby.

284
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:44,480
As soon as we're in Florida
we'll blow this whole setup.

285
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,400
You will not talk me into...

286
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:50,360
Extra. Extra. Seven slaughtered
in North Side garage.

287
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,950
Fear of bloody aftermath. Extra. Extra.

288
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:57,750
- You talked me into it. Let's go.
- Attagirl, Geraldine.

289
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,670
- Rosella.
- Fiddle.

290
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,790
- Move along, Dolores.
- Trombone.

291
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,290
- Hey, Olga, how's your back?
- Trumpet.

292
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,930
- Here we are.
- Are you two from the Poliakoff Agency?

293
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,800
- Yes. We're the new girls.
- Brand new.

294
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:18,100
This is our manager, Mr Bienstock.
And I'm Sweet Sue.

295
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,640
My name is Josephine.

296
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:23,020
I'm Daphne.

297
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,280
Saxophone, bass. Am I glad to see
you girls. You saved our lives.

298
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,190
Likewise, I'm sure.

299
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,360
Where did you girls play before?

300
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:34,740
Here, there and... around, and...

301
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:39,160
We spent three years
at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.

302
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,540
All aboard.

303
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,750
You're in berths 7 and 7A.

304
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:44,880
7 and 7A.

305
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,040
- Thanks ever so.
- You're welcome.

306
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:49,210
Oh. The feeling's mutual.

307
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:53,550
- Upsy-daisy.
- Fresh.

308
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,550
Looks like Poliakoff sent
a couple of real ladies.

309
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,060
You'd better tell the other girls
to watch their language.

310
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,990
What are you...?

311
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,780
Daphne?

312
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,740
I never did like the name Geraldine.

313
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,670
Hi. I'm the bass fiddle.
Just call me Daphne.

314
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,050
My name is Josephine. Sax.

315
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,800
- Welcome to No Man's Land.
- You'll be sorry.

316
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:38,430
- Take off your corsets and spread out.
- Oh, I don't wear one myself.

317
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,600
- Don't you bulge?
- Bulge? Me?

318
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,230
I have the most divine seamstress.
Comes in just once a month.

319
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:47,940
- She is so inexpensive and she told...
- Come on, Daphne.

320
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:51,440
Say, do you know the one
about the girl tuba player

321
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,450
who was stranded on an island
with a one-legged jockey?

322
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:58,620
- No. How does it go?
- Cut it out, girls. No rough talk.

323
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:02,580
They went to a conservatory.

324
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,040
How about that talent, huh?

325
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,960
- Like fallin' into a tub of butter.
- Watch it, Daphne.

326
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:16,300
When I was a kid, Joe, I dreamed I was
locked up overnight in a pastry shop.

327
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,590
And there was goodies all around.

328
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,350
Jelly rolls, mocha éclairs
and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts...

329
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:26,890
Listen to me: no butter, no pastry.
We're on a diet.

330
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,060
Yeah, sure, Joe.

331
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:31,900
Not there. That's the emergency brake.

332
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,900
Now you've done it.

333
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:39,870
- Done what?
- You tore off one of my chests.

334
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:43,370
- You'd better go get it fixed.
- You'd better come help me.

335
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,420
This way, Daphne.

336
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:56,510
Now you tore the other one.

337
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,350
Terribly sorry.

338
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,690
It's OK. I was scared it was Sweet Sue.

339
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,360
- You won't tell anybody, will you?
- Tell what?

340
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,860
If they catch me once more,
they'll kick me out of the band.

341
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,870
Are you the replacement
for the bass and sax?

342
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:25,040
That's us. And I'm Daphne.

343
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,200
This is Joe... sephine.

344
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,170
Come in.

345
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:31,080
I'm Sugar Cane.

346
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:34,250
- Sugar Cane?
- I changed it from Sugar Kowalczyk.

347
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:38,220
- Polish?
- Yes. I come from this musical family.

348
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,220
My mother's a piano teacher.
My father was a conductor.

349
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:45,010
- Where did he conduct?
- On the Baltimore and Ohio.

350
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,770
I play the ukulele, and I sing, too.

351
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,400
I don't have much of a voice,
but this isn't much of a band, either.

352
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,440
I'm only with them cos I'm running away.

353
00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:00,660
- Running away from what?
- Oh, don't get me started on that.

354
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,410
Hey, you want some? It's bourbon.

355
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:06,410
I'll take a rain check.

356
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:11,580
I don't want you to think I'm a drinker.
I can stop if I want to, only I don't want to.

357
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,420
- Especially when I'm blue.
- We understand.

358
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:18,550
All the girls drink. But I'm the one
that gets caught. Story of my life.

359
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:21,760
I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.

360
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,810
Are my seams straight?

361
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:31,100
I'll say.

362
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,650
- See you around, girls.
- Bye, Sugar.

363
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:38,150
We have been playing
with the wrong bands.

364
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,070
- Down, Daphne.
- See the shape of that liquor cabinet?

365
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,120
Forget it. One false move
and we're off the train.

366
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,450
Then it's the police,
the papers and the Mob in Chicago.

367
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,790
Boy, would I love to
borrow a cup of that Sugar.

368
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,500
Look...

369
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,750
No pastry, no butter-and no Sugar.

370
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,210
You tore 'em again.

371
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:41,510
Hey, Sheboygan. What was your last job?
Playing square dances?

372
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,670
No. Funerals.

373
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,720
Would you mind rejoining the living?
Goose it up a little.

374
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,810
We'll try.

375
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:52,980
How did those holes get there?

376
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,560
Those?

377
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:57,770
I don't know.

378
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,400
Mice?

379
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,780
All right, girls. Let's take it from the top.
And put a little heat under it.

380
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,220
Bienstock!

381
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,470
Yes, Sue?

382
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,640
I thought I made it clear
that I don't want any drinking in this outfit.

383
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,820
All right, girls. Who does this belong to?

384
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,070
Come on, now. Speak up.

385
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,740
- Sugar, I warned you...
- Please, Mr Bienstock.

386
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:34,120
I've had it. In Kansas you smuggled
liquor in a shampoo bottle.

387
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,540
Before that you had
a pint in your ukelele...

388
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,460
Mr Bienstock, could I have my flask?

389
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:41,500
Sure. Pack your things.
At the next station... Your flask?

390
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:45,500
Yes. Just a little bourbon.
Must have slipped through.

391
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:46,880
Give me that.

392
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:49,880
Didn't you girls say
you went to a conservatory?

393
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:54,220
- Oh, yes. For a whole year.
- I thought you said three years.

394
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:57,100
We got time off for good behaviour.

395
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:03,190
There are two things I will not put up with
during working hours: liquor and men.

396
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:06,480
- Men?
- Don't worry about that.

397
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,740
We wouldn't be caught dead with men.

398
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:12,110
Rough, hairy beasts with eight hands.

399
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,450
And they all just want
one thing from a girl.

400
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:18,500
I beg your pardon, miss.

401
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:21,620
All right, girls. From the top again.

402
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,870
- Hortense, dear, good night.
- Good night, Daphne.

403
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,380
- Maude, sweet dreams.
- Good night, Daphne.

404
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,380
Good night, Gloria.

405
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,130
Dolores, you sleep tight, you hear?

406
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,720
- Nighty-night, Emily.
- Toodle-oo.

407
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,270
How about that "toodle-oo".

408
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:23,560
Steady, boy.
Just keep tellin' yourself you're a girl.

409
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:26,400
- I'm a girl.
- You're a girl.

410
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,900
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

411
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,780
I'm a...

412
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:38,280
Get a load of that rhyzhm section.

413
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,490
I'm a girl.

414
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,660
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

415
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,830
I'm a girl.

416
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,420
Good night, Sugar.

417
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:54,550
Good night, honey.

418
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:58,550
Honey? Hey, she called me "honey".

419
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,390
Ooh, honey.

420
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:03,890
- What are you doin'?
- Just makin' sure honey stays in her hive.

421
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,270
There'll be no buzzin' around tonight.

422
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,690
Supposin' I gotta go...
like for a drink of water or something.

423
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,190
- Fight it.
- Well, suppose I lose.

424
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:16,200
- Suppose it's an emergency.
- Pull the emergency brake.

425
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:21,700
Hey, Bienstock. You know, there's
something funny about those new girls.

426
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:25,620
- Funny? In what way?
- I don't know, but I can feel it right here.

427
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:29,500
Having an ulcer is like
having a burglar alarm go off inside you.

428
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:32,380
You watch your ulcers,
I'll watch those two.

429
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:36,720
OK, everybody go to bed.
Good night, girls.

430
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,640
- Good night, Daphne.
- Good night, Josephine.

431
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:51,110
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

432
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:53,070
I wish I were dead.

433
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:57,240
I'm a girl... I'm a girl... I'm a girl...

434
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:40,570
Daphne.

435
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,920
Sugar.

436
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,010
I wanted to thank you for
covering up for me. You're a real pal.

437
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:01,390
It's nothing.

438
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,680
I just thought that
us girls should stick together.

439
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,850
If it wasn't for you,
they'd have kicked me off the train.

440
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:10,100
I'd be out in the middle of nowhere,
sitting on my ukulele.

441
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,360
It's freezing outside.

442
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,480
I mean, when I think about you
and your poor ukulele...

443
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:19,200
If there's ever anyzhing I can do for you...

444
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,820
I can think of a million things.

445
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,990
That's one of 'em.

446
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,660
It's Sweet Sue.

447
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,550
I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.

448
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,310
Oh, well, we won't tell anybody.
Not even Josephine.

449
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:50,520
Maybe I'd better stay here
till she goes back to sleep.

450
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,270
You stay here as long as you like.

451
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,030
I'm not crowding you, am I?

452
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:00,190
No. It's nice and cosy.

453
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:05,990
When I was a little girl, on cold nights
like this, I'd crawl into bed with my sister.

454
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,750
We'd cuddle up under the covers and
pretend we were lost in a dark cave

455
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:12,500
and were trying to find our way out.

456
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,080
Very interesting.

457
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:19,460
- Anyzhing wrong?
- No, no. Not a thing.

458
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,840
You poor thing. You're trembling all over.

459
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:26,010
That's ridiculous.

460
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,760
- Your head's hot.
- That's ridiculous.

461
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,350
- You've got cold feet.
- Isn't that ridiculous?

462
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,520
Here, let me warm them up a little.

463
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:38,610
- There. Isn't that better?
- Yes. I'm a girl... I'm a girl...

464
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:41,030
- What?
- I'm a very sick girl.

465
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,990
- I'd better go before I catch something.
- Not that sick.

466
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:46,070
I've got very low resistance.

467
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,120
Sugar, if you feel you're
coming down with something, my dear,

468
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,210
the best thing in the world
is a shot of whiskey.

469
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:56,210
- You've got some?
- I know where to get it.

470
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:57,880
Don't move.

471
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,920
- Hold on.
- OK.

472
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:24,700
Up. Up.

473
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,450
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

474
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:35,540
- How's the bottle?
- Half-full.

475
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,090
- You'd better get some cups.
- Cups?

476
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:53,180
Oh, I tell you, my dear,
this is the only way to travel.

477
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:56,100
Put on the lights.
I can't see what I'm doing.

478
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,690
No lights. We don't want them to know.

479
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:01,440
- But I might spill some.
- So spill it.

480
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:04,530
Spills, thrills, laughs and games.

481
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:07,320
This may even turn out
to be a surprise party.

482
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:09,820
- What's the surprise?
- Not yet.

483
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:12,450
- When?
- Better have a drink first.

484
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,620
That'll put hair on your chest.

485
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,790
No fair guessing.

486
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:20,170
Is this a private clambake?

487
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:22,250
It's private. Please, go away.

488
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,630
Dolores, do you still have that vermouth?

489
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,380
- Sure.
- Who needs vermouth?

490
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:29,550
We've got bourbon.
We can make Manhattans.

491
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,800
Manhattans? At this time of night?

492
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:34,470
- Bring the cocktail shaker.
- Oh, Sugar.

493
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,730
You're gonna spoil my surprise.

494
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,980
- Hey, honey, what's up?
- Party in upper 7.

495
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:45,150
- I'll get cheese and crackers.
- I'll get a shaker, you get a corkscrew.

496
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,570
Hey, Rosella, there's a party in upper 7.

497
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,610
- You got a corkscrew?
- Stella has.

498
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,200
Go get some paper cups.

499
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:54,910
Hey, there's a party in upper 7.

500
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,210
- Here's the vermouth.
- This is a private party. Please go away.

501
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,010
I brought some cheese and crackers.

502
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:09,970
- Will ten cups be enough?
- This is a party for two. Ten cups?

503
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:15,640
- Please, girls. Will you stop this?
- Could you use some Southern Comfort?

504
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:20,100
Girls, you'll wake up
the neighbours downstairs.

505
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:22,770
Watch that corkscrew.

506
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,940
- Here's a cracker.
- No crackers in bed.

507
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:28,530
Will you girls go away
and form your own party?

508
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,700
Here's the cocktail shaker.

509
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:34,120
- I wish we had ice.
- Easy on the vermouth.

510
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,330
1 3 girls in a berth is bad luck.
1 2 of you will have to get out.

511
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:41,870
- Pass me the peanut butter.
- Anyone for salami?

512
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,380
No more food.
I'll have ants in the morning.

513
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:49,760
Hey. Have you got any
maraschino cherries on you?

514
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,930
Never mind.

515
00:42:57,930 --> 00:42:59,980
Maraschino cherries?

516
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:10,700
What's going on here?

517
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:14,570
Daphne. Daphne, where are you?

518
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,200
It's not my fault. I didn't invite 'em.

519
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:20,790
Come on, girls, break it up.

520
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:24,750
You heard Josephine.
Girls. Everybody out.

521
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:28,250
- Not you, Sugar.
- I'm going to get some ice.

522
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,420
Get out.

523
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:33,300
That's right, Sugar.
Now the rest of you. Out.

524
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:37,680
- Come on in. The water's fine.
- Have a Manhattan.

525
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:41,310
- Pipe down. We'll all be fired.
- Sugar. Don't leave me here alone.

526
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:44,020
Come on, kids. It's two o'clock.

527
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:47,440
You've had your fun.
The party's over. Everybody go home.

528
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,570
- What's this?
- Josephine, over here before it melts.

529
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:00,620
Put it here.

530
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:03,120
Sugar, you're gonna
get into a lot of trouble.

531
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:05,000
You'd better keep a lookout.

532
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,210
If Bienstock catches you again...

533
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,460
What's the matter with you, anyway?

534
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:11,630
I'm not very bright, I guess.

535
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,010
I wouldn't say that. Careless, maybe.

536
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:19,010
No, just dumb. If I had any brains, I
wouldn't be with this crummy girls' band.

537
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,970
Well, why'd you take this job?

538
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,890
I used to sing with male bands,
but I can't afford it any more.

539
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:26,480
Have you ever been with a male band?

540
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,020
Who, me?

541
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:29,770
That's what I'm running away from.

542
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,530
I worked with six in the last two years.
Oh, brother.

543
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:35,610
- Rough?
- I'll say.

544
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:38,700
- You can't trust those guys.
- I can't trust myself.

545
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:41,370
I have this thing about saxophone players.

546
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:43,540
Especially tenor sax.

547
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:49,040
- Really?
- I don't know why, but they curdle me.

548
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:52,710
All they have to do is play eight bars of
"Come To Me, My Melancholy Baby"

549
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:56,590
and I get goose-pimply all over,
and I come to 'em.

550
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,010
- That so?
- Every time.

551
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,850
You know, I play tenor sax.

552
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:06,940
But you're a girl-thank goodness.
That's why I joined this band.

553
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:11,320
Safety first. Anyzhing
to get away from those bums.

554
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,650
You don't know what they're like.
You fall for 'em.

555
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:17,820
You think this is gonna be
the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin.

556
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:20,410
The next thing you know,
they're borrowing money from you,

557
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:23,790
spending it on other dames
and betting on horses.

558
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:25,330
You don't say.

559
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:28,790
Then one morning you wake up,
the guy's gone, the sax's gone.

560
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:33,590
All that's left is a pair of old socks
and a tube of toothpaste all squeezed out.

561
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:38,130
You pull yourself together, you go on to
the next job, the next saxophone player.

562
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:40,470
It's the same thing all over again.

563
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:44,310
You see what I mean? Not very bright.

564
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:46,600
Brains aren't everyzhing.

565
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:50,860
I can tell you one thing. It's not
gonna happen to me again-ever.

566
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:53,980
I'm tired of getting
the fuzzy end of the lollipop.

567
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:58,110
Ice. What's keeping the ice?
The natives are getting restless.

568
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,120
- How about a couple of drinks for us?
- Sure.

569
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:05,620
- You know, I'm gonna be 25 in June.
- You are?

570
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:08,410
That's a quarter of a century.
Makes a girl think.

571
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:10,250
- About what?
- The future.

572
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:13,840
You know-like a husband. That's why
I'm glad we're going to Florida.

573
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:17,210
- What's in Florida?
- Millionaires. Flocks of them.

574
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,760
They all go south for the winter, like birds.

575
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:23,180
- Gonna catch yourself a rich bird?
- I don't care how rich he is.

576
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:27,430
As long as he has a yacht, a private
railroad car and his own toothpaste.

577
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,690
- You're entitled.
- Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.

578
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:34,610
With money like Rockefeller and
shoulders like Johnny Weissmuller.

579
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:37,440
- I want mine to wear glasses.
- Glasses?

580
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:41,490
Men who wear glasses are so much
more gentle and sweet and helpless.

581
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:44,910
- Haven't you ever noticed it?
- Yeah, now that you mention.

582
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:47,700
They get those weak eyes from reading.

583
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:52,380
Those long, tiny little columns
in The Wall Street Journal.

584
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:56,210
That bass fiddle, she sure
knows how to throw a party.

585
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:59,260
Hot-diggety-dog.

586
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:01,880
Well, happy days.

587
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:07,640
I hope this time you wind up
with the sweet end of the lollipop.

588
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:11,440
So the one-legged jockey said...

589
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,600
What did he say?

590
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:19,360
So the one-legged jockey said: "Don't
worry about me, baby. I ride side-saddle."

591
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,830
I'm terribly sorry. I seem to have hiccups.

592
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,370
Hey, let's rub some ice on her neck.

593
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,540
I think... Ow. You dropped it.

594
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:35,380
Oh, that's cold.

595
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:39,170
- Oh, no, please. Don't do that.
- She's ticklish.

596
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,390
Help. Please. Help. Help.

597
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:46,890
Josephine.

598
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:50,560
Please stop that. Stop that.

599
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:03,240
- What happened?
- Search me.

600
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,410
I mean, I'll see.

601
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,340
All right, what's goin' on around here?

602
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:20,380
Bienstock!

603
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:23,380
Are we in Florida?

604
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:10,010
Sugar?

605
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:12,520
Here. I'll carry the instruments.

606
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,100
- Thank you, Daphne.
- Thank you, Daphne.

607
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:17,480
Isn't she a sweetheart?

608
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:25,780
How do you do?

609
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:30,160
Zowie!

610
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:33,830
There they are. More millionaires
than you can shake a stick at.

611
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:35,830
I bet there isn't one under 75.

612
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,330
That's three quarters of a century.
Makes a girl think.

613
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:42,130
Let's hope they brought
their grandsons along.

614
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,800
Yes.

615
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:54,850
Pardon me, miss.

616
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,640
- May I?
- Help yourself.

617
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:01,480
I'm Osgood Fielding the Third.

618
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:03,690
I'm Cinderella the Second.

619
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:08,450
If there's one thing I admire,
it's a girl with a shapely ankle.

620
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:11,160
Me, too. Bye-bye.

621
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:14,790
- Let me carry one of the instruments.
- Oh, thank you.

622
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:17,370
Aren't you a sweetheart.

623
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:25,420
It certainly is delightful
having young blood around here.

624
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:27,010
Personally, I'm type O.

625
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:29,800
I've always been fascinated
by show business.

626
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:31,300
Is that so?

627
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:34,760
As a matter of fact,
it's cost my family quite a bit of money.

628
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:37,730
- Oh, you invest in shows?
- Showgirls.

629
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:40,770
- I've been married seven or eight times.
- You're not sure?

630
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,860
Mama is keeping score.

631
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:45,780
- She's getting annoyed with me.
- I wouldn't wonder.

632
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:49,650
So when George White's Scandals
opened, she packed me off to Florida.

633
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:54,620
She thinks I'm out on my yacht,
deep-sea fishing.

634
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:59,870
Well, pull in your reel, Mr Fielding.
You're barking up the wrong fish.

635
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:04,340
If I promise not to be a naughty boy,
how about dinner?

636
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:07,550
- I'm sorry. I'll be on the bandstand.
- Oh, of course.

637
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:10,220
- Which instrument do you play?
- Bull fiddle.

638
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:11,800
Oh, fascinating.

639
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:14,180
Do you use a bow, or do you just pluck it?

640
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:18,350
Most of the time, I slap it.

641
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:20,940
You must be quite a girl.

642
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:22,900
Wanna bet?

643
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:26,770
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer.
Sort of a contortionist.

644
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:30,360
She could smoke a cigarette
while holding it between her toes.

645
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:31,900
Zowie!

646
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:34,070
- But Mama broke it up.
- Why?

647
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,450
She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.

648
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,750
- Bye-bye, Mr Fielding.
- Bye-bye?

649
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:43,960
- This is where I get off.
- Oh, no. No, no, no.

650
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,130
You don't get off that easy.

651
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:48,840
All right, driver.
Once around the park, slowly.

652
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,340
And keep your eyes on the road.

653
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:03,690
What kind of a girl
do you think I am, Mr Fielding?

654
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:08,360
- Oh, please. It won't happen again.
- I'll say.

655
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,030
- Please, come back.
- I'll walk, thank you.

656
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:13,200
Please, miss...

657
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:17,330
Zowie!

658
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:20,450
All right, girls. Here are
your room assignments.

659
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:23,290
My glasses. Where are my glasses?

660
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,580
Olga and Mary Lou are in 41 2.

661
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:30,170
And, Mary Lou, do up your kimono
when you ring for room service.

662
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,470
Josephine and Daphne are in 41 3.

663
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:35,680
- Dolores and Sugar in 414.
- Me and Sugar?

664
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,180
What did you expect?
A one-legged jockey?

665
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,890
Rosella and Emily in 41 5...

666
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:43,180
- I wish they'd put us in the same room.
- So do I.

667
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:46,940
But don't worry about it, Sugar.
We'll see a lot of each other.

668
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:52,570
414... That's the same room number
I had in Cincinnati,

669
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:54,820
my last time around with a male band.

670
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:56,780
What a heel he was.

671
00:52:56,910 --> 00:53:00,580
- A saxophone player?
- What else? Was I ever crazy about him.

672
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:03,700
At two in the morning he sent me down
for hot dogs and potato salad.

673
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:06,580
They were out of potato salad,
so I brought coleslaw.

674
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:10,460
- So he threw it right in my face.
- Forget saxophone players.

675
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:13,260
You're gonna meet
a millionaire-a young one.

676
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:16,840
- What makes you so sure?
- My feminine intuition.

677
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:27,060
Oh. Are these your bags?

678
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,400
- And that one, too.
- OK, doll.

679
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,990
- I suppose you want a tip.
- Forget it, doll.

680
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:41,240
After all, you work here and I work here.
It's nice to have you with the organisation.

681
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:43,660
- Bye-bye.
- Listen, doll.

682
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:46,620
- What time do you get off tonight?
- Why?

683
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:50,000
I'm workin' the night shift and
I got a bottle of gin stashed away.

684
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:53,630
- When there's a lull...
- Aren't you a little young for that, sonny?

685
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:57,590
Oh, you wanna see my driver's licence?

686
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:03,390
- Get lost, will you?
- That's the way I like 'em-big and sassy.

687
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:06,600
Oh, and... get rid of your roommate.

688
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:23,450
- Dirty old man.
- What happened?

689
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:26,830
- I got pinched in the elevator.
- See how the other half lives?

690
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:28,460
I'm not even pretty.

691
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:32,840
They don't care. You're wearing a skirt.
It's like waving a red flag to a bull.

692
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,760
I'm sick of being the flag.
I wanna be a bull again.

693
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,880
- Let's blow.
- Blow where?

694
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:41,340
You promised me that the minute
we hit Florida we'd beat it.

695
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:45,180
- How can we? We're broke.
- We can find another band. A male band.

696
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:50,520
Spats Colombo is looking for us
in every male band in the country.

697
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:54,020
- It's humiliating.
- So you got pinched. So what?

698
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:56,900
Would you rather be
picking lead out of your navel?

699
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:58,990
But how long can we keep this up?

700
00:54:59,110 --> 00:55:01,660
What's the beef? We're sittin' pretty.

701
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:05,240
Look. We get room and board.
We're getting paid every week. Look.

702
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:07,700
Look at the palm trees, flying fish...

703
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:10,040
What are you givin' me with flyin' fish?

704
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,630
I know why you wanna stay.
You're after Sugar.

705
00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:15,670
- Me, after Sugar?
- I saw the both of you in that bus.

706
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:19,720
All lovey-dovey and whisperin'
and borrowin' each other's lipstick.

707
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:22,510
- What are you saying? Me and Sugar?
- You and Sugar.

708
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:26,310
- We're just like sisters.
- Well, I'm your fairy godmother.

709
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:29,060
And I'm gonna keep an eye on you.

710
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:32,310
Are you decent?

711
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:39,070
Come in.

712
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:42,910
You girls seen a brown bag
with a white stripe and my initials?

713
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:44,660
It has all my resort clothes.

714
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:47,240
- No, we haven't.
- I can't understand it.

715
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:50,080
First my glasses disappear,
then one of my suitcases.

716
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,160
- Where's my ukulele?
- Now a ukulele.

717
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:56,880
- There must be a sneak thief around here.
- Oh. Here it is. Hi, Sug.

718
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,840
- We're going for a swim. Coming?
- A swim. Oh, you betcha.

719
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:03,720
You haven't got a bathing suit.

720
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,760
I don't have one either.

721
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:09,770
- She doesn't have one either. You don't?
- We can rent some at the bathhouse.

722
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:13,440
- How about you, Josephine?
- I think I'll soak in a hot tub.

723
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:17,730
- On a day like this? It's lovely out.
- Yeah, well, let her soak. Come on.

724
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:21,150
- Don't get burned, Daphne.
- Oh, I've got suntan lotion.

725
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:26,740
See? She'll rub it on me, I'll rub it on her,
we'll rub it on each other. Bye-bye.

726
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:32,640
Daphne. Cut it out.
What do you think you're doing?

727
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:35,690
Just a little trick
I picked up in the elevator.

728
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:38,940
Ooh, look out. Here comes a big one.

729
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:12,220
Daphne. I had no idea
you were such a big girl.

730
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:15,060
You should've seen me
before I went on a diet.

731
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:17,270
I mean your shoulders and your arms.

732
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:19,650
It's carrying that bull fiddle around.

733
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:22,230
- There's one thing I envy you for.
- What's that?

734
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,440
You're so flat-chested.

735
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:27,400
Clothes hang better on you
than they do on me.

736
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:29,570
Watch out, Daphne.

737
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:32,240
Sugar, come on. Let's play ball.

738
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,490
Junior, time for your nap.

739
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:37,910
No. I wanna play.

740
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:40,290
You heard your mother, Junior. Scram!

741
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:43,170
This beach ain't big enough
for the both of us.

742
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:45,500
Mommy!

743
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:46,920
Here we go.

744
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:50,090
I like coffee, I like tea.

745
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:53,930
How many boys are stuck on me?

746
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:57,310
One, two, three,

747
00:58:57,430 --> 00:59:00,690
four, five, six, seven...

748
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:09,650
I'm terribly sorry.
You're not hurt, are you?

749
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:12,200
- I don't think so.
- I wish you'd make sure.

750
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,410
Because when people find out who I am,

751
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:19,410
they hire a shyster lawyer and sue me
for three quarters of a million dollars.

752
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:23,000
- I won't sue you, no matter who you are.
- Thank you.

753
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:27,420
- Who are you?
- Now, really!

754
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,300
Sugar!

755
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,680
Come on.

756
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:34,970
Honestly.

757
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:38,140
Cheerio.

758
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:46,070
- Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
- Not very likely.

759
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:48,650
- Are you staying at the hotel?
- Not at all.

760
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,860
Your face is familiar.

761
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:53,530
You may have seen it
in newspapers or magazines.

762
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:56,490
- Vanity Fair.
- That must be it.

763
00:59:56,620 --> 01:00:00,290
Would you mind moving a little?
You're blocking my view.

764
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:01,500
Of what?

765
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:05,790
They run up a red-and-white flag
on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.

766
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,960
You own a yacht?

767
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,920
Which one is it? The big one?

768
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:12,680
Certainly not.

769
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:17,510
With all the world unrest, nobody should
have a yacht that sleeps more than 1 2.

770
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,600
I quite agree.

771
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,930
Tell me, who runs up that flag?

772
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:24,770
- Your wife?
- No, my flag steward.

773
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:28,070
Who mixes the cocktails? Your wife?

774
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:30,280
No, my cocktail steward.

775
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,780
Look, if you're interested in
whether I am married or not...

776
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:35,780
- Oh, I'm not interested at all.
- Well, I'm not.

777
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:39,120
That's very interesting.

778
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:44,670
- How's the stock market?
- Up, up, up.

779
01:00:44,790 --> 01:00:47,500
I'll bet while we were talking,
you made $100,000?

780
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:49,670
Could be. You play the market?

781
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:53,050
- No, the ukulele. And I sing, too.
- For your own amusement?

782
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:55,180
We are appearing at the hotel.

783
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:57,470
Sweet Sue and her Society Syncopators.

784
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:01,810
- You're society girls.
- Oh, yes, quite. Bryn Mawr, Vassar...

785
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:04,100
We're just doing this for a lark.

786
01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:08,860
Syncopators. Does that mean you play
that very fast music... jazz?

787
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:11,650
Yeah. Real hot.

788
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:15,360
I guess some like it hot.
I personally prefer classical music.

789
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,110
I do, too.

790
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:22,370
As a matter of fact, I spent three years
at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.

791
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:26,330
Good school. Your family
doesn't object to your career?

792
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:29,880
They do indeed. Daddy threatened
to cut me off without a cent.

793
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,800
But I don't care. It was such a bore.

794
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,260
- Coming-out parties.
- Inauguration balls.

795
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:36,430
- Opening at the opera.
- Riding to hounds.

796
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:39,430
And always the same 400.

797
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:42,310
It's amazing we never
ran into each other before.

798
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:45,430
I'd have remembered
anybody as attractive as you.

799
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:49,310
You're very kind. I'll bet
you're also gentle and helpless.

800
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,860
I beg your pardon?

801
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:53,610
You see, I have a theory
about men who wear glasses.

802
01:01:53,730 --> 01:01:56,990
- What theory?
- I'll tell you when I know you better.

803
01:01:57,110 --> 01:01:59,780
- What are you doing tonight?
- Tonight?

804
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:02,990
Maybe you could come
to the hotel and hear us play.

805
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:06,000
- I'd like to, but that would be difficult.
- Why?

806
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:09,500
I only come ashore twice a day
when the tide goes out.

807
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:12,500
It's on account of these shells.
That's my hobby.

808
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:15,630
- You collect shells?
- So did my father and grandfather.

809
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,220
You might say we had
a passion for shells.

810
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:20,890
That's why we named
the oil company after it.

811
01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:27,100
- Shell Oil?
- Please, no names. Just call me Junior.

812
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:29,310
Sugar!

813
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:30,900
Time to change for dinner.

814
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:34,360
Run along, Daphne dear.
I'll catch up with you later.

815
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,460
What, young lady?
What are you staring at?

816
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:49,500
Happens to me all the time.

817
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:52,920
I recognised him, too.
His picture was in Vanity Fair.

818
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:56,420
- Would you move along, please?
- Yes. You're in his way.

819
01:02:56,550 --> 01:02:59,090
He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.

820
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:01,180
His yacht?

821
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:04,760
It sleeps 1 2. This is my friend Daphne.
She's a Vassar girl.

822
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:06,600
I'm a what?

823
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,770
Or was it Bryn Mawr?

824
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:13,770
I heard a very sad story
about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.

825
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:15,690
She squealed on her roommate

826
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:18,950
and they found her strangled
with her own brassiere.

827
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:24,120
Yes. We have to be very careful
whom we pick for a roommate. Hm?

828
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:26,330
Well, I think I'd better be going.

829
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:28,580
It was delightful meeting you both.

830
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:31,790
- You will come and hear us play?
- If it's at all possible.

831
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,170
Do come. It'll be such fun.

832
01:03:34,290 --> 01:03:37,340
- And bring your yacht.
- Come on, Daphne.

833
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:47,680
- How about that guy?!
- Hands off. I saw him first.

834
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:52,690
Sugar, a little advice. If I were a girl,
and I am, I'd watch my step.

835
01:03:52,810 --> 01:03:55,690
If I'd been watching my step,
I never would have met him.

836
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:59,570
- I can't wait to tell Josephine.
- Yeah, Josephine...

837
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:02,490
I can't wait to see her face.
Will she be surprised.

838
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:05,160
Neither can I.
Let's go tell her right now.

839
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,740
- We don't have to run.
- Oh yes, we do.

840
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:18,340
Josephine. Yoo-hoo.

841
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:22,010
- I guess she's not here.
- Isn't that funny. Josie!

842
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:24,180
I can't imagine where she'd be.

843
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:26,350
- I'll be back later.
- Oh, no. You wait.

844
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:28,640
I have a feeling
she'll show up any minute.

845
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:32,980
- Believe it or not, Josephine predicted it.
- Yes. This is one for Ripley.

846
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:36,190
- Do you suppose she went shopping?
- Shopping. That's it.

847
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:40,940
Something tells me she's gonna come
through that door in a brand-new outfit.

848
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:57,500
- Josephine.
- Oh. I didn't hear you come in.

849
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:09,140
- Have a good time, girls?
- The most wonderful thing happened.

850
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:10,890
- What?
- Guess.

851
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:15,230
- They repealed Prohibition?
- Oh, you can do better than that.

852
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:18,230
- I met one of them.
- One of whom?

853
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:22,360
Shell Oil Junior. He's got millions,
glasses and a yacht.

854
01:05:22,490 --> 01:05:23,860
You don't say.

855
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:25,910
He's not only got a yacht.
He's got a bicycle.

856
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:28,070
Daphne.

857
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:30,240
Go on. Tell me all about him.

858
01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:33,540
Well, he's young and he's handsome.
He's a bachelor.

859
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:38,290
He's a real gentleman.
You know. Not one of these grabbers.

860
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:40,840
Maybe you'd better go after him
if you don't want to lose him.

861
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:45,090
I'm not gonna let this one get away.
He's so cute. He collects shells.

862
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:47,590
Shells? Whatever for?

863
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:51,010
Oh, you know. The old shell game?

864
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:52,770
Daphne, you're bothering us.

865
01:05:52,890 --> 01:05:55,560
- Anyway, you're gonna meet him tonight.
- I am?

866
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:57,940
He said he'd come
to hear us play-maybe.

867
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:02,610
What do you mean, maybe? I saw the way
he looked at you. He'll be there for sure.

868
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:04,190
I hope so.

869
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:07,950
What do you think, Josephine?
What does your crystal ball say?

870
01:06:08,610 --> 01:06:11,660
Sugar. Is Sugar in here?

871
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:15,910
Sugar, you got the key? I'm locked out
and I'm makin' a puddle in the hall.

872
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:18,540
See you on the bandstand, girls.

873
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:25,970
What are you tryin' to do to that girl,
puttin' on a millionaire act?

874
01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:30,180
And that phoney accent?
Nobody talks like that.

875
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,510
I've seen you pull
some low tricks on women.

876
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:36,480
This is without doubt
the trickiest, lowest, meanest...

877
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,860
I'm not afraid of you.

878
01:06:46,530 --> 01:06:48,490
I'm thin, but I'm wiry.

879
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:52,660
You're gonna get hurt.
When I'm aroused, I'm a tiger.

880
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:57,500
Joe. Don't look at me like that.
It was all a joke. I didn't mean any harm.

881
01:06:57,620 --> 01:07:00,790
I'm gonna press
the suit myself. Telephone.

882
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:03,250
Answer the tele... phone.

883
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:09,260
Hello?

884
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:12,680
Yes, this is 41 3.

885
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:16,270
Ship to shore? All right, I'll take it.

886
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:19,060
Daphne? It's that naughty boy again.

887
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:21,520
You know - Osgood? In the elevator?

888
01:07:21,650 --> 01:07:24,360
You slapped my face?

889
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:28,320
- Who is this?
- This is her roommate.

890
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,700
Daphne can't talk right now. Is it urgent?

891
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:33,370
Well, it is to me.
Will you give her a message?

892
01:07:33,490 --> 01:07:37,910
Tell her I'd like her to have supper with
me on my yacht after the show tonight.

893
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:41,210
Got it. Supper, yacht,
after the show. I'll tell her.

894
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:44,960
- Your yacht?
- The New Caledonia. That's its name.

895
01:07:45,090 --> 01:07:49,720
The Old Caledonia went down
during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.

896
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:54,970
But tell her not to worry. This'll be a quiet
little midnight snack, just the two of us.

897
01:07:56,430 --> 01:08:00,060
Just the two of you?
What about the crew?

898
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:04,310
That's all been taken care of.
I'm giving them shore leave.

899
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,900
We'll have cold pheasant
with champagne.

900
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:11,700
I've checked with the coastguard.
There's gonna be a full moon tonight.

901
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:16,200
And tell her I've got
a new batch of Rudy Vallee records.

902
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:21,160
That's good thinking.
Daphne's a pushover for him.

903
01:08:21,290 --> 01:08:23,750
Pushover for who? What...

904
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:26,000
Yes, Mr Fielding.

905
01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:29,880
You'll pick her up after the show
in your motorboat. Goodbye.

906
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:31,880
What's that you said?

907
01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:36,600
- "Zowie." I'll give her the message.
- What message? What motorboat?

908
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:40,890
You got it made. Fielding wants to have
cold pheasant with you on his yacht.

909
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:44,690
Just the three of you on that
great big boat. You, him and Rudy Vallee.

910
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:47,270
Fat chance. Call him back
and say I'm not goin'.

911
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,070
Of course you're not.

912
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:51,240
I'm going.

913
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:54,820
You're gonna be on the boat
with that dirty old man?

914
01:08:54,950 --> 01:08:57,160
I'm gonna be on the boat with Sugar.

915
01:08:57,280 --> 01:09:00,160
- Where's he gonna be?
- He's gonna be ashore with you.

916
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:01,950
- With me?
- That's right.

917
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:05,000
Oh, no. Not tonight, Josephine.

918
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:24,040
Daphne, your boyfriend's waving at you.

919
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:26,210
You can both go take a flyin' jump.

920
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:29,420
Remember, he's your date
for tonight, so smile.

921
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:35,460
Oh, you can do better than that.
Give him the teeth, the whole personality.

922
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:48,020
Why do I let you talk me
into these things? Why?

923
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:50,900
Because we're pals. The two musketeers.

924
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:54,860
Don't give me the musketeers.
How am I gonna keep him ashore?

925
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:57,900
Tell him you get seasick.
Play miniature golf with him.

926
01:10:58,030 --> 01:11:02,410
Oh, no. I'm not gonna get caught
in a miniature sand trap with that guy.

927
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,460
Hi. Which of you dolls is Daphne?

928
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:11,210
Bull fiddle.

929
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:13,590
From satchel mouth at table seven.

930
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:22,430
- This is from me to you, doll.
- Beat it, buster.

931
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:26,100
Never mind leaving your door open.
I got a passkey.

932
01:11:31,810 --> 01:11:35,900
- What are you doin' with my flowers?
- Borrowing 'em. You'll get 'em back.

933
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:08,890
I guess he's not gonna show up.
It's five minutes to one.

934
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:12,770
- Do you suppose he forgot?
- You know how those millionaires are.

935
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:14,770
These came for you.

936
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:16,730
For me?

937
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:19,780
It's Shell Oil.

938
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:21,990
- No!
- Yes!

939
01:12:22,110 --> 01:12:24,370
He wants to have supper
with me on his yacht.

940
01:12:24,490 --> 01:12:26,240
He's picking me up at the pier.

941
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:27,790
- No!
- Yes.

942
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:29,750
You heard her-yes.

943
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:34,380
Josephine, just imagine. Me,
Sugar Kowalczyk from Sandusky, Ohio,

944
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,340
on a millionaire's yacht.

945
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:39,130
If my mother could only see me now.

946
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:43,760
I hope my mother never finds out.

947
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:48,600
That's it for tonight.
This is Sweet Sue saying good night,

948
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:54,190
reminding all you daddies out there
that every girl in my band is a virtuoso.

949
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:56,980
And I intend to keep it that way.

950
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:05,280
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

951
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:38,210
But it's such a waste.
A full moon, an empty yacht.

952
01:14:38,330 --> 01:14:40,710
- I'll throw up.
- Then let's go dancing.

953
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,250
There's a roadhouse down the coast...

954
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:50,510
Well, I'll be... He does have a bicycle.

955
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,560
Who?

956
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:54,640
About the roadhouse?

957
01:14:54,770 --> 01:14:57,060
They have a Cuban band
that's the berries.

958
01:14:57,180 --> 01:15:01,230
Let's go there, blindfold the orchestra
and tango till dawn.

959
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,400
- You know something, Mr Fielding?
- What?

960
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,570
You're dynamite.

961
01:15:05,690 --> 01:15:08,570
You're a pretty hot
little firecracker yourself.

962
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,250
Ahoy, there.

963
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:06,670
Ahoy.

964
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:17,220
- Been waiting long?
- It's not how long you wait.

965
01:16:17,390 --> 01:16:21,310
- It's who you're waiting for.
- Thank you. And for the flowers.

966
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:26,270
I wanted them to fly orchids from our
greenhouse, but Long Island is fogged in.

967
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,440
It's the thought that counts.

968
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:37,580
I seem to be out of gas.

969
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:41,710
It's sort of funny, you being out of gas.
I mean, Shell Oil and everyzhing.

970
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:43,920
Oops. There.

971
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,170
It seems to be stuck in reverse.

972
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:56,140
I just got this motorboat.
It's an an experimental model.

973
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:58,430
It seems like they're on the wrong track.

974
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,310
Do you mind riding backwards?
It may take a little longer.

975
01:17:01,430 --> 01:17:04,810
It's not how long it takes.
It's who's taking you.

976
01:17:31,090 --> 01:17:33,130
It looked so small from the beach.

977
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:36,550
But when you're on it, it's like
a cruiser or a destroyer.

978
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:41,520
It's just regulation-size. We have three.
Mother keeps hers in Southampton.

979
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:44,810
Daddy's is in Venezuela.
The company is laying a new pipeline.

980
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:48,940
My dad's more interested in railroads.
Baltimore and Ohio.

981
01:17:49,070 --> 01:17:51,280
Which is the port
and which is the starboard?

982
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:54,200
That depends on
whether you're coming or going.

983
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:58,410
I mean, normally the aft
is on the other side of the stern.

984
01:17:58,530 --> 01:18:03,200
And that's the bridge. So that you can get
from one side of the boat to the other.

985
01:18:03,330 --> 01:18:07,080
- Would you like a glass of champagne?
- Love it. Which way?

986
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:13,760
- You have an upstairs and a downstairs.
- Yes, the hurricane cellar.

987
01:18:15,550 --> 01:18:20,100
And another nice thing about
this yacht-lots of closet space.

988
01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:24,560
Now, let me see. Where do you
suppose the steward set it up?

989
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:29,400
In here.

990
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:32,400
Of course. How silly of me.

991
01:18:32,530 --> 01:18:36,200
On Thursdays they always
serve me in the small salon.

992
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:47,710
It's exquisite. Like a floating mansion.

993
01:18:47,830 --> 01:18:49,960
It's all right for a bachelor.

994
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:54,710
- What a beautiful fish.
- I caught him off Cape Hatteras.

995
01:18:55,670 --> 01:18:57,720
What is it?

996
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,760
It's a member of the herring family.

997
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:03,510
A herring?

998
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:08,310
Isn't it amazing how they get those
big fish into those little glass jars?

999
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:10,650
They shrink when they're marinated.

1000
01:19:10,770 --> 01:19:12,820
- Champagne?
- I don't mind if I do.

1001
01:19:12,940 --> 01:19:15,650
Well, down the hatch, as we say at sea.

1002
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:17,900
Bon voyage.

1003
01:19:21,870 --> 01:19:24,660
- Look at all that silverware.
- Trophies.

1004
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:28,160
You know. Skeet shooting,
dog breeding, water polo.

1005
01:19:28,290 --> 01:19:30,420
Isn't water polo terribly dangerous?

1006
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:33,130
I'll say. I had two ponies
drowned under me.

1007
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:35,300
Where's your shell collection?

1008
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:37,920
Yes, of course.
Where could they have put it?

1009
01:19:38,050 --> 01:19:40,720
You see, on Thursdays
I'm sort of lost around here.

1010
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:43,850
- What's on Thursdays?
- It's the crew's night off.

1011
01:19:43,970 --> 01:19:47,220
- You mean we're alone on the boat?
- Completely.

1012
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:51,100
I've never been completely alone
with a man in the middle of the night,

1013
01:19:51,270 --> 01:19:53,940
- In the middle of the ocean.
- Oh, it's perfectly safe.

1014
01:19:54,070 --> 01:19:56,980
We're anchored.
The ship's in shipshape shape.

1015
01:19:57,110 --> 01:19:59,780
The coastguard will call
if any icebergs appear.

1016
01:20:00,450 --> 01:20:01,820
It's not the icebergs.

1017
01:20:01,950 --> 01:20:05,280
But certain men would try to
take advantage of a situation like this.

1018
01:20:05,410 --> 01:20:09,250
- You're flattering me.
- Of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.

1019
01:20:10,210 --> 01:20:13,880
It's not that. It's just that I'm harmless.

1020
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:16,800
- Harmless? How?
- I don't know how to put it,

1021
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:19,170
but I've got this thing about girls.

1022
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:22,840
- What thing?
- They just sort of leave me cold.

1023
01:20:22,970 --> 01:20:24,850
You mean, like, frigid?

1024
01:20:24,970 --> 01:20:27,430
Well, it's more like a mental block.

1025
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:31,060
When I'm with a girl,
it does absolutely nothing to me.

1026
01:20:31,190 --> 01:20:35,610
- Have you tried?
- Have I. I'm trying all the time.

1027
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:45,120
See? Nothing.

1028
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:47,790
- Nothing at all?
- Complete washout.

1029
01:20:47,950 --> 01:20:51,210
- That makes me feel just awful.
- My dear, it's not your fault.

1030
01:20:51,330 --> 01:20:54,290
Now and then Mother Nature
throws somebody a dirty curve.

1031
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:56,500
Something goes wrong inside.

1032
01:20:56,630 --> 01:20:59,670
- You mean you can't fall in love?
- Not any more.

1033
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:02,590
I was in love once,
but I'd rather not talk about it.

1034
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:05,720
- Would you like a little cold pheasant?
- What happened?

1035
01:21:05,850 --> 01:21:09,140
- I don't want to bore you.
- You couldn't possibly.

1036
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:11,310
Well...

1037
01:21:11,430 --> 01:21:13,640
It was my freshman year at Princeton.

1038
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:16,110
There was this girl. Her name was Nellie.

1039
01:21:16,230 --> 01:21:18,940
Her father was
the vice president of Hupmobile.

1040
01:21:19,070 --> 01:21:21,570
She wore glasses, too.

1041
01:21:21,690 --> 01:21:24,240
That summer we were
at the Grand Canyon.

1042
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:27,240
We were on the highest ledge
watching the sunset,

1043
01:21:27,370 --> 01:21:29,830
when suddenly we got
this impulse to kiss.

1044
01:21:29,950 --> 01:21:33,410
I took off my glasses.
She took off her glasses.

1045
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:35,630
I took a step toward her.

1046
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:38,750
She took a step toward me.

1047
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:43,170
Yes. Eight hours later
they brought her up by mule.

1048
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:47,390
I gave her three transfusions.
We had the same type blood-type O.

1049
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:50,390
But it was too late.

1050
01:21:50,510 --> 01:21:52,390
Talk about sad.

1051
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:54,560
Ever since then,

1052
01:21:54,690 --> 01:21:58,270
numb, no feelings, like my heart
was shot full of Novocain.

1053
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,730
You poor, poor boy.

1054
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:03,740
Yes. All the money in the world,
and what good is it?

1055
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:05,700
Mint sauce or cranberries?

1056
01:22:06,450 --> 01:22:09,580
How can you think about food
at a time like this?

1057
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:11,740
What else is there for me?

1058
01:22:11,870 --> 01:22:15,500
- Is it that hopeless?
- My family did everyzhing they could.

1059
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:18,380
Hired the most beautiful
French upstairs maids.

1060
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:21,670
Got a special tutor to read me
books that were banned in Boston.

1061
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:24,010
Imported a troupe of Balinese dancers

1062
01:22:24,130 --> 01:22:27,470
with those bells on their ankles
and long fingernails.

1063
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:29,930
What a waste of money.

1064
01:22:30,050 --> 01:22:32,390
Have you ever tried American girls?

1065
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,270
Why?

1066
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:42,110
Was that anyzhing?

1067
01:22:43,190 --> 01:22:45,240
Thanks just the same.

1068
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:48,280
You should see a doctor-a good doctor.

1069
01:22:48,410 --> 01:22:53,080
I have. I spent six months in Vienna
with Professor Freud, flat on my back.

1070
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:58,920
Then there were the Mayo brothers,
injections, hypnosis, mineral baths.

1071
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,540
If I wasn't such a coward, I'd kill myself.

1072
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:05,010
Don't say that.

1073
01:23:05,130 --> 01:23:07,880
There must be some girl
someplace that could...

1074
01:23:08,010 --> 01:23:12,220
If I ever found a girl that could,
I'd marry her just like that.

1075
01:23:13,220 --> 01:23:16,100
- Would you do me a favour?
- Certainly. What is it?

1076
01:23:16,230 --> 01:23:20,150
I may not be Dr Freud or a Mayo brother
or one of those French upstairs girls,

1077
01:23:20,270 --> 01:23:22,980
but could I take another crack at it?

1078
01:23:23,770 --> 01:23:26,320
All right, if you insist.

1079
01:23:39,210 --> 01:23:43,460
- Anyzhing this time?
- I'm afraid not.

1080
01:23:43,590 --> 01:23:47,010
- Terribly sorry.
- Would you like some more champagne?

1081
01:23:49,470 --> 01:23:53,220
Maybe if we had some music.
How do you dim these lights?

1082
01:23:54,350 --> 01:23:58,020
Look, it's terribly sweet of you
to want to help out, but it's no use.

1083
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:00,390
I think the light switch is over there.

1084
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:08,240
That's the radio.

1085
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:11,910
It's like taking someone
to a concert when he's tone-deaf.

1086
01:24:48,030 --> 01:24:50,700
You're not giving yourself a chance.

1087
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:53,570
Don't fight it.

1088
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:56,200
Relax.

1089
01:25:09,590 --> 01:25:11,800
It's like smoking without inhaling.

1090
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:13,970
So inhale.

1091
01:25:37,070 --> 01:25:38,410
Daphne,

1092
01:25:38,530 --> 01:25:40,910
- You're leading again.
- Sorry.

1093
01:25:55,220 --> 01:25:56,840
Well?

1094
01:25:58,390 --> 01:26:00,430
I'm not quite sure.

1095
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:02,930
Would you try it again?

1096
01:26:13,150 --> 01:26:16,360
I got a funny sensation in my toes.

1097
01:26:17,370 --> 01:26:20,450
Like someone was barbecuing them
over a slow flame.

1098
01:26:21,870 --> 01:26:24,660
Let's throw another log on the fire.

1099
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:36,760
I think you're on the right track.

1100
01:26:37,590 --> 01:26:41,100
I must be. Your glasses
are beginning to steam up.

1101
01:27:05,790 --> 01:27:08,330
I never knew it could be like this.

1102
01:27:09,750 --> 01:27:11,790
Thank you.

1103
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:15,090
They told me I was kaput,
finished, all washed up.

1104
01:27:15,210 --> 01:27:18,880
And here you are, making a chump
out of all those experts.

1105
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,930
Mineral baths. Now, really.

1106
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:27,520
Where did you learn to kiss like that?

1107
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:30,940
I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.

1108
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:45,750
Tomorrow, remind me to send
a cheque for $100,000 to the Milk Fund.

1109
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:52,480
Whoops.

1110
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:23,340
- Good night.
- Good morning.

1111
01:29:23,470 --> 01:29:25,600
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?

1112
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:28,260
$850,000.

1113
01:29:28,430 --> 01:29:31,060
Let's make it an even million.

1114
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:54,460
I forgot to give you a receipt.

1115
01:30:35,710 --> 01:30:38,000
Hi, Jerry. Everyzhing under control?

1116
01:30:38,130 --> 01:30:40,800
Have I got things to tell you.

1117
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:44,380
- What happened?
- I'm engaged.

1118
01:30:44,510 --> 01:30:47,890
Congratulations. Who's the lucky girl?

1119
01:30:48,010 --> 01:30:49,680
I am.

1120
01:30:53,980 --> 01:30:55,730
What?

1121
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:59,190
Osgood proposed to me.
We're planning a June wedding.

1122
01:31:01,650 --> 01:31:04,740
What are you talking about?
You can't marry Osgood.

1123
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:09,530
- Do you think he's too old for me?
- Jerry, you can't be serious.

1124
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:12,450
Why not? He keeps
marryin' girls all the time.

1125
01:31:13,910 --> 01:31:16,040
But... you're not a girl. You're a guy.

1126
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:18,210
And why would a guy
wanna marry a guy?

1127
01:31:18,330 --> 01:31:20,290
Security.

1128
01:31:21,340 --> 01:31:24,840
- Jerry, lie down. You're not well.
- Stop treatin' me like a child.

1129
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:28,220
- I'm not stupid. I know there's a problem.
- I'll say there is.

1130
01:31:28,340 --> 01:31:33,010
His mother. We need her approval. But
I'm not worried because I don't smoke.

1131
01:31:35,890 --> 01:31:39,400
- Jerry, there's another problem.
- Like what?

1132
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:43,520
- Like your honeymoon.
- We've been discussing that.

1133
01:31:43,650 --> 01:31:47,740
He wants to go to the Riviera,
but I kinda lean towards Niagara Falls.

1134
01:31:51,450 --> 01:31:54,700
Jerry, you're outta your mind.
You can't get away with this.

1135
01:31:54,830 --> 01:31:58,660
I don't expect it to last.
I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.

1136
01:31:58,830 --> 01:32:01,580
- Like when?
- Like right after the ceremony.

1137
01:32:01,710 --> 01:32:05,130
Then we get a quick annulment,
he makes a nice settlement on me

1138
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:08,420
and I keep gettin' those
alimony cheques every month.

1139
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:14,850
Jerry, listen to me.

1140
01:32:14,970 --> 01:32:18,310
There are laws, conventions.
It's just not been done.

1141
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:22,190
Joe, this may be my last chance
to marry a millionaire.

1142
01:32:22,310 --> 01:32:26,360
Jerry, will you take my advice?
Forget about the whole thing, will you?

1143
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:30,280
Just keep telling yourself you're a boy.

1144
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:33,620
- I'm a boy.
- That's the boy.

1145
01:32:33,740 --> 01:32:37,250
I'm a boy, I'm a boy, I'm a...

1146
01:32:37,370 --> 01:32:41,120
I wish I were dead.
I'm a boy. Boy, oh boy, am I a boy.

1147
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:43,630
What about my engagement present?

1148
01:32:43,750 --> 01:32:47,210
- What engagement present?
- Osgood gave me a bracelet.

1149
01:32:48,970 --> 01:32:50,630
Hey, these are real diamonds.

1150
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:53,470
Of course they're real.
You think my fianc?is a bum?

1151
01:32:53,590 --> 01:32:58,140
- I guess I'll have to give it back to him.
- Wait a minute, Jerry. Let's not be hasty.

1152
01:32:58,270 --> 01:33:01,770
After all, we don't wanna
hurt Osgood's feelings.

1153
01:33:04,770 --> 01:33:07,480
- Just a minute.
- It's me. Sugar.

1154
01:33:14,780 --> 01:33:15,700
Come in.

1155
01:33:16,950 --> 01:33:21,500
I thought I heard voices. I had to talk to
somebody. I don't feel like going to sleep.

1156
01:33:21,620 --> 01:33:25,500
- What you need is a slug of bourbon.
- Oh, no. I'm off that stuff for good.

1157
01:33:26,170 --> 01:33:29,760
- Did you have a nice time?
- Nice?

1158
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:33,010
It was suicidally beautiful.

1159
01:33:33,130 --> 01:33:34,300
Did he get fresh?

1160
01:33:34,430 --> 01:33:37,930
Of course not. As a matter of fact,
it was just the other way around.

1161
01:33:38,060 --> 01:33:40,310
- You see, he needs help.
- What for?

1162
01:33:40,430 --> 01:33:43,190
Talk about elegant.
You should see the yacht.

1163
01:33:43,310 --> 01:33:46,810
Candlelight, mint sauce and cranberries.

1164
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:49,650
Gee, I wish I'd been there.

1165
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:52,190
I'm going to see him again
tonight-and every night.

1166
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:54,110
I think he's going to propose.

1167
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:57,070
- As soon as he gets up his nerve.
- That's some nerve.

1168
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:59,410
Daphne got a proposal tonight.

1169
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:02,620
- Really?
- From a rich millionaire.

1170
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:04,620
That's wonderful.

1171
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:06,960
- Poor Josephine.
- Me?

1172
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:08,880
Well, Daphne has a beau, I have a beau...

1173
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,670
If we could only find somebody for you.

1174
01:34:14,050 --> 01:34:16,090
Here I am, doll.

1175
01:34:42,370 --> 01:34:45,750
"Friends of Italian Opera" - That's us.

1176
01:34:45,870 --> 01:34:48,210
Register over there.

1177
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:00,510
Spats Colombo. Delegate from Chicago.
South Side Chapter.

1178
01:35:01,470 --> 01:35:03,600
Thanks.

1179
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:05,270
Hiya, Spats.

1180
01:35:05,390 --> 01:35:08,480
- We was layin' 8-1 you wouldn't show.
- Why wouldn't I?

1181
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:11,770
We thought you was all broken up
about Toothpick Charlie.

1182
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:16,240
- We all gotta go sometime.
- Yeah. You never know who's next.

1183
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:18,700
OK, Spats. Report to the sergeant at arms.

1184
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:22,580
- What for?
- Orders from Little Bonaparte.

1185
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:30,130
- All right, Spats, get your hands up.
- What's the idea?

1186
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:33,210
Little Bonaparte don't want
no hardware around.

1187
01:35:33,340 --> 01:35:35,550
All right, you're clean.

1188
01:35:35,670 --> 01:35:37,760
You're not.

1189
01:35:47,850 --> 01:35:50,400
It ain't loaded.

1190
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:01,240
Next. What's in here?

1191
01:36:01,370 --> 01:36:04,830
My golf clubs. Putter, niblick, No.3 iron.

1192
01:36:05,790 --> 01:36:08,160
- What's this?
- My mashie.

1193
01:36:13,210 --> 01:36:15,760
See you at the banquet, Spats.

1194
01:36:16,670 --> 01:36:19,970
Where did you pick up that cheap trick?

1195
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:22,550
Come on, boys.

1196
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:25,560
Well. Spats Colombo, if I ever saw one.

1197
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:27,980
Hello, copper.
What brings you to Florida?

1198
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:30,190
I heard you opera-lovers were meetin'.

1199
01:36:30,310 --> 01:36:33,270
Thought I'd come in case
anybody decided to sing.

1200
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:34,610
Big joke.

1201
01:36:34,730 --> 01:36:37,110
Where were you at 3pm
on St Valentine's Day?

1202
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:40,280
- I was at Rigoletto.
- What's his first name and address?

1203
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:42,450
It's an opera, you ignoramus.

1204
01:36:42,570 --> 01:36:45,870
- In the garage on Clark Street?
- Clark Street? Never heard of it.

1205
01:36:45,990 --> 01:36:49,500
Ever hear of Deluxe Cleaners
on Wabash Avenue?

1206
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:52,880
The day after the shoot
you sent in spats with blood on 'em.

1207
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,790
I cut myself while shaving.

1208
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:57,670
- You shave with spats on?
- I sleep with my spats on.

1209
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:01,180
Stop kidding. You vulcanised
Toothpick Charlie, and we know it.

1210
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:02,550
You and who else?

1211
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:06,640
Me and those two witnesses you
have been lookin' for all over Chicago.

1212
01:37:06,810 --> 01:37:09,640
Boys, know anyzhing about
any garage or witnesses?

1213
01:37:09,770 --> 01:37:12,440
Us? We was with you at Rigoletto's.

1214
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:14,860
Honest.

1215
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:20,650
Don't worry, Spats. One of these days
we're gonna dig up those two guys.

1216
01:37:20,780 --> 01:37:23,240
That's what you'll have to do-dig 'em up.

1217
01:37:32,870 --> 01:37:37,340
I feel like such a tramp, taking jewellery
from a man under false pretences.

1218
01:37:37,460 --> 01:37:41,130
Get it while you're young. Fix your lips
if you wanna look nice for Osgood.

1219
01:37:41,260 --> 01:37:43,880
It'll break his heart when
he finds out I can't marry him.

1220
01:37:44,010 --> 01:37:47,260
It'll break Sugar's heart when
she finds out I'm not a millionaire.

1221
01:37:47,390 --> 01:37:49,850
Can't make an omelette
without breakin' an egg.

1222
01:37:50,020 --> 01:37:52,310
- What's with the omelette?
- Nag, nag, nag.

1223
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:57,190
We got a yacht, a bracelet, you've got
Osgood, I've got Sugar. We'll be cookin'.

1224
01:38:01,190 --> 01:38:03,240
- Joe!
- What?

1225
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:08,370
Something tells me the omelette
is about to hit the fan.

1226
01:38:10,580 --> 01:38:12,620
Come on, Daphne.

1227
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:18,920
- Going up.
- Hold it.

1228
01:38:26,930 --> 01:38:28,850
Three, please.

1229
01:38:40,070 --> 01:38:41,690
I don't mean to be forward,

1230
01:38:41,820 --> 01:38:44,950
but ain't I had the pleasure
of meetin' you two broads before?

1231
01:38:45,070 --> 01:38:47,700
- Oh, no.
- You must mean two other broads.

1232
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:51,080
- You ever been in Chicago?
- Us?

1233
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:53,660
We wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago.

1234
01:38:53,790 --> 01:38:55,040
Third floor.

1235
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:58,330
- What floor are you on, sweetie?
- Never you mind.

1236
01:38:59,420 --> 01:39:01,460
Room 41 3. We'll be in touch.

1237
01:39:01,590 --> 01:39:04,380
Don't call us. We'll call you.

1238
01:39:16,690 --> 01:39:18,690
I tell you, Joe, they're onto us.

1239
01:39:18,810 --> 01:39:22,190
They're gonna line us up
against the wall and...

1240
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:25,490
The cops will find two dead dames
and take us to the morgue

1241
01:39:25,610 --> 01:39:27,860
and when they undress us,
I'll die of shame.

1242
01:39:27,990 --> 01:39:31,030
- Shut up and keep packing.
- Yeah. OK, Joe.

1243
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:33,330
- Not that, you idiot.
- They're from Osgood.

1244
01:39:33,450 --> 01:39:35,660
He wanted me to wear 'em tonight.

1245
01:39:39,380 --> 01:39:42,460
I tell you, I will never find
another man who's so good to me.

1246
01:39:42,590 --> 01:39:47,170
Joe, if we get outta this hotel alive,
we'll sell this bracelet, take the money,

1247
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:50,470
grab a boat to South America
and hide out in a banana republic.

1248
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:54,520
I figured if we eat nothing but bananas,
we could live there for 50 years.

1249
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:56,480
If we get outta the hotel alive.

1250
01:39:56,600 --> 01:39:59,520
- Did we forget anyzhing?
- Yeah. The shaving stuff.

1251
01:39:59,650 --> 01:40:01,940
- And also Sugar.
- Sugar?

1252
01:40:02,060 --> 01:40:04,070
- Give me room 414.
- What are you doin'?

1253
01:40:04,190 --> 01:40:06,570
- Making a telephone call.
- Who has time?

1254
01:40:06,690 --> 01:40:08,950
We can't walk out on her
without a goodbye.

1255
01:40:09,070 --> 01:40:12,030
You usually walk out and leave 'em
with a kick in the teeth.

1256
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:15,540
That's when I was a saxophone player.
Now I'm a millionaire.

1257
01:40:15,660 --> 01:40:19,120
Mail her a postcard.
Those gorillas may be here any minute.

1258
01:40:19,250 --> 01:40:21,960
Room 414?
This is the ship-to-shore operator.

1259
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:23,670
Ship to shore?

1260
01:40:23,790 --> 01:40:26,260
Hey, Sugar, it's for you. From the yacht.

1261
01:40:31,180 --> 01:40:35,100
Hello, my dearest darling.
It's good to hear your voice.

1262
01:40:35,260 --> 01:40:37,640
I may throw up.

1263
01:40:39,230 --> 01:40:43,230
No, I didn't sleep too well, darling.
To tell the truth, I never closed an eye.

1264
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:47,190
I never slept better.
I had the most wonderful dream.

1265
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:49,650
I was still on the yacht
and the anchor broke loose.

1266
01:40:49,780 --> 01:40:52,530
We drifted for days and days.

1267
01:40:52,660 --> 01:40:54,450
You were the captain and I was the crew.

1268
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:59,460
I kept a lookout for icebergs, I sorted
your shells and mixed your cocktails,

1269
01:40:59,580 --> 01:41:02,380
and I wiped the steam off your glasses.

1270
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:06,500
And when I woke up, I wanted
to swim right back to you.

1271
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:09,130
Yes...

1272
01:41:09,260 --> 01:41:11,590
Now, about our date for tonight...

1273
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:14,600
I'll meet you on the pier again
right after the show.

1274
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:18,810
I'm afraid not. I can't make it tonight.

1275
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:23,150
Not tomorrow either. I have to leave.

1276
01:41:23,270 --> 01:41:27,020
Something unexpected came up.
I'm sailing right away.

1277
01:41:27,150 --> 01:41:29,320
Where to?

1278
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:32,070
South America?

1279
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:34,910
That is unexpected.

1280
01:41:35,780 --> 01:41:38,580
You see, we have
these oil interests in Venezuela.

1281
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:42,790
I just got a cable from Dad. The board
of directors have decided on a merger.

1282
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:45,880
A merger? How long will you be gone?

1283
01:41:48,050 --> 01:41:49,960
Quite a while.

1284
01:41:50,090 --> 01:41:53,050
As a matter of fact,
I'm not coming back at all.

1285
01:41:53,180 --> 01:41:55,220
You're not?

1286
01:41:55,640 --> 01:41:58,970
Well, it's all rather complicated.
What we call high finance.

1287
01:41:59,100 --> 01:42:03,890
It just so happens the president of the
Venezuelan oil syndicate has a daughter...

1288
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:07,360
Oh. That kind of merger.

1289
01:42:07,480 --> 01:42:09,440
What is she like?

1290
01:42:09,570 --> 01:42:12,280
According to our tax adviser,
she's only so-so.

1291
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:14,200
But that's the way the oil gushes.

1292
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:18,030
A man in my position
has a responsibility to the stockholders.

1293
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:21,700
All those little people
who have invested their life savings.

1294
01:42:21,830 --> 01:42:25,670
Of course. I understand.
At least, I think I do.

1295
01:42:25,790 --> 01:42:31,710
I knew you would. I only wish there
was something I could do for you.

1296
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:35,430
But you have. You've given me
all that inside information.

1297
01:42:35,550 --> 01:42:37,470
Tomorrow I'm gonna call my broker

1298
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:40,850
and have him buy me
50,000 shares of Venezuelan oil.

1299
01:42:40,970 --> 01:42:43,060
Smart move.

1300
01:42:43,180 --> 01:42:46,100
By the way, did you get my flowers?

1301
01:42:46,230 --> 01:42:48,690
You know, those orchids
from my greenhouse?

1302
01:42:48,810 --> 01:42:53,030
The fog finally lifted over Long Island
and they flew them down this morning.

1303
01:42:53,150 --> 01:42:56,910
That's strange. I sent 'em to your room.

1304
01:42:58,620 --> 01:43:00,990
They should have been delivered by now.

1305
01:43:04,710 --> 01:43:08,210
Hey, Dolores, will you see
if there's any flowers outside?

1306
01:43:14,220 --> 01:43:16,970
Yes, they're here. White orchids.

1307
01:43:17,090 --> 01:43:20,180
I haven't had white orchids
since I was a debutante.

1308
01:43:22,060 --> 01:43:24,100
What's this?

1309
01:43:25,230 --> 01:43:26,730
What's what?

1310
01:43:26,850 --> 01:43:29,520
Oh, that. Just a little going-away present.

1311
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:33,230
Real diamonds.

1312
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:37,860
They must be worth their weight in gold.
Are you always this generous?

1313
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:40,830
Not always.

1314
01:43:40,950 --> 01:43:43,910
I wanted you to know how grateful
I am for what you did for me.

1315
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:47,370
I didn't do anyzhing. It just happened.

1316
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:52,920
The navigator just came in.
We're ready to cast off.

1317
01:43:53,050 --> 01:43:56,420
Well, anchors aweigh,
and have a bon voyage.

1318
01:43:56,550 --> 01:43:58,970
If you need an orchestra
to play at your wedding,

1319
01:43:59,090 --> 01:44:01,100
we'll be through here
in a couple of weeks.

1320
01:44:01,220 --> 01:44:03,680
Goodbye, my darling.

1321
01:44:03,810 --> 01:44:07,270
I don't know about the captain but
the navigator's gettin' his tail outta here.

1322
01:44:07,390 --> 01:44:10,560
- Yeah, let's shove off.
- Wait a minute. My bracelet.

1323
01:44:13,110 --> 01:44:14,860
What happened to my bracelet?

1324
01:44:14,980 --> 01:44:19,070
- Your bracelet? It's ours.
- All right. What happened to our bracelet?

1325
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:23,490
- We did the right thing with it.
- You're not pullin' one of your old tricks.

1326
01:44:23,620 --> 01:44:26,000
No tricks, no mirrors,
nothing up my sleeve.

1327
01:44:26,120 --> 01:44:28,660
It's on the level this time.

1328
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:36,880
Where's that bourbon?

1329
01:44:42,970 --> 01:44:47,640
- What's the matter, Sugar?
- I don't know. All of a sudden I'm thirsty.

1330
01:44:48,730 --> 01:44:50,650
How did you get that bracelet?

1331
01:44:50,770 --> 01:44:52,650
- You like it?
- I always did.

1332
01:44:52,770 --> 01:44:57,610
Junior gave it to me. He's gone
to South America to marry another girl.

1333
01:44:57,740 --> 01:45:00,910
- That's what you call high finance.
- That's what I call a louse.

1334
01:45:01,030 --> 01:45:04,620
If I were you, I'd take that bracelet
and throw it back in his face.

1335
01:45:04,740 --> 01:45:09,500
He's the first nice guy I've met in my life.
The only one that ever gave me anyzhing.

1336
01:45:09,620 --> 01:45:12,170
You'll forget him, Sugar.

1337
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:17,920
How can I? No matter where I go, there'll
always be a Shell station on every corner.

1338
01:45:18,050 --> 01:45:21,430
I'll bring this back when it's empty.

1339
01:45:23,470 --> 01:45:26,850
Are you crazy? The place
is crawlin' with mobsters.

1340
01:45:26,970 --> 01:45:30,180
And you're makin' like
Diamond Jim Brady.

1341
01:45:30,310 --> 01:45:32,440
How are we gonna get outta here?
How are we gonna eat?

1342
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:36,610
- We'll walk. If we have to, we'll starve.
- There's that "we" again.

1343
01:45:36,730 --> 01:45:40,110
Not that way. We don't wanna
run into Spats and his chums.

1344
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:51,000
Your hands clean?

1345
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:52,540
Over.

1346
01:45:52,670 --> 01:45:54,710
OK, button my spats.

1347
01:45:57,590 --> 01:45:59,630
You sure dress nice, boss.

1348
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:02,880
Say, boss. I've been talking
with the other delegates.

1349
01:46:03,010 --> 01:46:07,350
The word is, Little Bonaparte is real sore
over what happened to Toothpick Charlie.

1350
01:46:07,470 --> 01:46:11,350
- Him and Charlie was choirboys together.
- Stop or I'll bust out cryin'.

1351
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:15,150
He even got Charlie's last toothpick
from the garage. Had it gold-plated.

1352
01:46:15,270 --> 01:46:17,320
Like I was tellin' you fellas.

1353
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:20,780
Little Bonaparte's gettin' soft.
Hasn't got it here any more.

1354
01:46:20,900 --> 01:46:23,200
Used to be like a rock.

1355
01:46:23,320 --> 01:46:28,120
- It's too bad. I think it's time he retired.
- Second the motion.

1356
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:30,120
How are we gonna retire him?

1357
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:32,330
Oh, we'll think of somethin' cute.

1358
01:46:32,460 --> 01:46:36,630
Little Bonaparte and Toothpick Charlie
will be singin' in the same choir again.

1359
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:43,340
But this time we'll make sure
there are no witnesses.

1360
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:49,760
Look. The two broads from the elevator.

1361
01:46:52,270 --> 01:46:54,890
Hey. Join us.

1362
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:58,440
What's the matter with those dames?

1363
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:00,900
Maybe those dames ain't dames.

1364
01:47:03,530 --> 01:47:06,280
Same faces, same instruments.

1365
01:47:09,990 --> 01:47:13,580
- Here's your Valentine's card.
- The two musicians from the garage.

1366
01:47:13,700 --> 01:47:18,580
They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago,
so we'll finish the job here. Come on.

1367
01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:41,610
- All right, so what do we do now?
- First we gotta get out of these clothes.

1368
01:49:20,460 --> 01:49:21,540
What happened?

1369
01:49:21,710 --> 01:49:25,130
Me and Tiny had them cornered,
but we lost them in the shuffle.

1370
01:49:25,250 --> 01:49:28,510
- Where were you guys?
- We was with you, at Rigoletto's.

1371
01:49:28,630 --> 01:49:32,260
- Why, you stupid idiot.
- Boss, we'll get 'em after the banquet.

1372
01:49:32,390 --> 01:49:34,890
They can't be too far away.

1373
01:49:53,990 --> 01:49:56,030
Thank you.

1374
01:49:56,160 --> 01:49:58,490
Thank you, fellow opera-lovers.

1375
01:49:59,750 --> 01:50:03,830
It's been ten years since I elected myself
president of this organisation,

1376
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:08,050
and, if I say so myself,
you made the right choice.

1377
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:13,550
Let's look at the record.
In the last fiscal year,

1378
01:50:13,680 --> 01:50:17,810
we made $1 1 2 million before taxes.

1379
01:50:17,930 --> 01:50:20,980
Only we ain't payin' no taxes.

1380
01:50:22,100 --> 01:50:26,520
Of course, like in every business,
we had our little misunderstandings.

1381
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:30,610
Let us now observe one minute of silence

1382
01:50:30,740 --> 01:50:35,110
in memory of seven of our members
from Chicago, North Side Chapter,

1383
01:50:35,240 --> 01:50:39,990
who are unable to be with us tonight
on account of bein' rubbed out.

1384
01:50:44,420 --> 01:50:46,540
You too, Spats.

1385
01:50:46,670 --> 01:50:48,710
Up.

1386
01:50:58,260 --> 01:51:00,010
Easy, now.

1387
01:51:00,140 --> 01:51:03,430
- You know when you come out?
- Yeah. Second time they sing:

1388
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:07,650
For he's a jolly good fellow
which nobody can deny.

1389
01:51:07,770 --> 01:51:09,820
OK.

1390
01:51:13,740 --> 01:51:17,910
And don't mess up the cake. I promised
to bring back a piece to my kids.

1391
01:51:25,410 --> 01:51:27,710
Now, fellow delegates,

1392
01:51:27,830 --> 01:51:31,460
there comes a time in the life
of every business executive

1393
01:51:31,590 --> 01:51:34,340
when he starts thinkin' about retirement.

1394
01:51:34,470 --> 01:51:36,510
No!

1395
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:42,180
I'm lookin' around
for somebody to fill my shoes.

1396
01:51:42,310 --> 01:51:45,480
I've been considerin' several candidates.

1397
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:48,900
For instance, there's
a certain party from Chicago,

1398
01:51:49,020 --> 01:51:51,190
South Side Chapter.

1399
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:58,950
Now, some people say
he's gotten a little too big for his spats.

1400
01:51:59,070 --> 01:52:02,830
But I say he's a man who'll go far.

1401
01:52:02,950 --> 01:52:07,080
Some people say he's gone too far.

1402
01:52:07,210 --> 01:52:10,880
But I say,
you can't keep a good man down.

1403
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:14,170
Of course, he's still got a lot to learn.

1404
01:52:14,300 --> 01:52:16,880
The big noise he made
on St Valentine's Day,

1405
01:52:17,010 --> 01:52:20,340
that wasn't very good for public relations.

1406
01:52:20,470 --> 01:52:26,310
And lettin' them two witnesses get away.
That sure was careless.

1407
01:52:26,430 --> 01:52:29,440
Don't worry about those two.
They're as good as dead.

1408
01:52:29,560 --> 01:52:31,690
I almost caught up with them today.

1409
01:52:31,810 --> 01:52:35,860
You mean you let 'em get away twice?

1410
01:52:35,990 --> 01:52:39,240
Some people would say
that's real sloppy.

1411
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:43,530
But I say: to err is human,
to forgive divine.

1412
01:52:43,660 --> 01:52:46,040
And just to show you
what I think of you, Spats,

1413
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:48,620
the boys told me
you was gonna have a birthday.

1414
01:52:48,750 --> 01:52:50,790
So we baked you a little cake.

1415
01:52:51,630 --> 01:52:53,540
My birthday?

1416
01:52:53,670 --> 01:52:56,090
Why, it ain't for another four months.

1417
01:52:56,210 --> 01:53:00,090
So we're a little early.
What's a few months between friends?

1418
01:53:00,220 --> 01:53:02,600
All right, boys. Now all together.

1419
01:53:02,760 --> 01:53:05,100
For he's a jolly good fellow.

1420
01:53:05,350 --> 01:53:07,560
For he's a jolly good fellow.

1421
01:53:07,810 --> 01:53:11,560
For he's a jolly good fellow.

1422
01:53:11,690 --> 01:53:14,190
Which nobody can deny.

1423
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:16,230
Which nobody can deny.

1424
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:19,110
Which nobody can deny.

1425
01:53:19,240 --> 01:53:21,610
For he's a jolly good fellow.

1426
01:53:21,780 --> 01:53:23,870
For he's a jolly good fellow.

1427
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:27,330
For he's a jolly good fellow.

1428
01:53:27,910 --> 01:53:31,080
Which nobody can deny.

1429
01:53:46,390 --> 01:53:48,430
Big joke.

1430
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:57,480
Let's get outta here.

1431
01:54:00,360 --> 01:54:02,820
Get those two guys.

1432
01:54:09,700 --> 01:54:11,500
What happened here?

1433
01:54:11,620 --> 01:54:15,920
There was somethin' in that cake
that didn't agree with 'em.

1434
01:54:17,170 --> 01:54:21,550
My compliments to the chef. Nobody
leaves this room till I get the recipe.

1435
01:54:21,670 --> 01:54:24,260
You wanna make a federal case of it?

1436
01:54:28,720 --> 01:54:30,560
Yeah.

1437
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:59,800
They slipped through our hands.

1438
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:04,010
We're watchin' the train station, roads
and airport. They can't get away.

1439
01:55:04,130 --> 01:55:07,050
- Did you hear that?
- But they're not watching yachts.

1440
01:55:07,180 --> 01:55:10,220
- You're gonna call Osgood.
- What'll I tell him?

1441
01:55:10,350 --> 01:55:13,020
Tell him you're gonna elope with him.

1442
01:55:13,140 --> 01:55:15,600
Elope? But there are laws, conventions.

1443
01:55:15,730 --> 01:55:19,650
There's a convention, all right.
There's also the ladies' morgue.

1444
01:57:21,810 --> 01:57:23,360
Josephine.

1445
01:57:24,820 --> 01:57:27,570
Bienstock!

1446
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:30,490
Hey. That's no dame.

1447
01:57:30,950 --> 01:57:33,160
None of that, Sugar.

1448
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:35,410
No guy is worth it.

1449
01:57:38,540 --> 01:57:40,580
Grab her.

1450
01:57:44,290 --> 01:57:46,340
Josephine?

1451
01:57:51,630 --> 01:57:55,180
- Osgood's meeting us at the pier.
- We're not on the pier yet.

1452
01:58:45,900 --> 01:58:47,320
Hi.

1453
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:50,030
My friend Josephine,
gonna be a bridesmaid.

1454
01:58:50,150 --> 01:58:52,190
- Pleased to meet you.
- Come on.

1455
01:58:52,320 --> 01:58:54,200
She's so eager.

1456
01:59:08,250 --> 01:59:10,300
Wait for Sugar!

1457
01:59:15,640 --> 01:59:18,010
- Another bridesmaid?
- Flower girl.

1458
01:59:18,140 --> 01:59:21,390
- Sugar, what are you doing?
- I told you, I'm not very bright.

1459
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:23,560
Let's go.

1460
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:28,230
You don't want me, Sugar.

1461
01:59:28,360 --> 01:59:30,900
I'm a liar and a phoney.
A saxophone player.

1462
01:59:31,030 --> 01:59:33,400
One of those no-goodniks
you keep running away from.

1463
01:59:33,530 --> 01:59:34,990
I know. Every time.

1464
01:59:35,110 --> 01:59:38,240
Sugar, do yourself a favour.
Go back to the millionaires.

1465
01:59:38,370 --> 01:59:39,950
The sweet end of the lollipop,

1466
01:59:40,080 --> 01:59:44,000
not the coleslaw in the face
and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste.

1467
01:59:44,160 --> 01:59:47,290
That's right, pour it on. Talk me out of it.

1468
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:54,300
I called Mama.
She was so happy, she cried.

1469
01:59:54,420 --> 01:59:57,510
She wants you to have
her wedding gown. It's white lace.

1470
01:59:57,640 --> 02:00:00,680
Osgood, I can't get married
in your mother's dress.

1471
02:00:01,970 --> 02:00:05,350
She and l, we are not built the same way.

1472
02:00:05,480 --> 02:00:08,150
- We can have it altered.
- Oh no, you don't.

1473
02:00:09,150 --> 02:00:12,650
Osgood, I'm gonna level with you.
We can't get married at all.

1474
02:00:12,780 --> 02:00:14,190
Why not?

1475
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:15,780
Well...

1476
02:00:15,900 --> 02:00:18,450
In the first place, I'm not a natural blonde.

1477
02:00:18,570 --> 02:00:20,200
Doesn't matter.

1478
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:22,700
I smoke. I smoke all the time.

1479
02:00:22,870 --> 02:00:24,500
I don't care.

1480
02:00:24,620 --> 02:00:28,830
I have a terrible past. For three years
I've been living with a saxophone player.

1481
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:31,000
I forgive you.

1482
02:00:32,500 --> 02:00:35,300
I can never have children.

1483
02:00:35,420 --> 02:00:38,880
- We can adopt some.
- You don't understand, Osgood.

1484
02:00:40,970 --> 02:00:43,180
- I'm a man.
- Well,

1485
02:00:43,310 --> 02:00:45,770
nobody's perfect.

1486
02:00:56,400 --> 02:00:59,490
