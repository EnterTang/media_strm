卡尔汉堡店六块一个的汉堡  现在只卖三块九毛五
Carl's Jr. has this $6 burger, which really only costs $3.95...

33
00:02:53,689 --> 00:02:55,884
真的很划算
...so you think you're getting some deal...

34
00:02:56,058 --> 00:02:59,892
我觉得这是附近最好吃的汉堡
...but the truth is, it may be the best franchise burger out there.

35
00:03:00,396 --> 00:03:03,729
昨天我吃了三个
I went there yesterday and ordered three.

36
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,063
天啊  快撑死了
By golly, those suckers almost filled me up.

37
00:03:07,236 --> 00:03:11,468
回家后我又吃一整盒松饼
When I got home, I still had to have a box of Eggos...

38
00:03:11,641 --> 00:03:14,667
并不是说卡尔汉堡无法满足我
...but that doesn't take away from Carl's achievement.

39
00:03:14,844 --> 00:03:19,679
我是说  这个叫卡尔的家伙  一辈子活在汉堡的盛名之下
I mean, here's a guy who's got to go through life as Carl Junior, right?.

40
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:24,309
永远无法摆脱老爸的阴影  或卡尔的创始人  我猜的
Like he can never get out of the shadow of his dad, the original Carl, I guess.

41
00:03:24,854 --> 00:03:28,654
你这样狂吃  不觉得会害死你老妈吗
Do you think this eating has to do with thinking you killed your mother?

42
00:03:28,858 --> 00:03:31,656
想吃死来惩罚自己
That you're eating yourself to death as punishment?.

43
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:36,826
你认为是你杀了她  对吗  我可没那样说
You do think you killed her, right?. I never said that.

44
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,235
她在床上大声喊你
She called out to you from that big, fancy oak bed.

45
00:03:40,403 --> 00:03:43,895
她说胸口疼痛  我从没跟你提过
She said she was having chest pain. I never told you any of that!

46
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:47,372
你怎么知道  她求你叫救护车
How could you know this?. She begged you to dial 91 1.

47
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,137
但她常常没事乱叫你  是不是  贝利
But she was always calling out for you, wasn't she, Barry?.

48
00:03:51,914 --> 00:03:56,874
而你又不在场  怎么会知道
You weren't there. How could you know what happened?. How?.

49
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:03,785
那不重要  重要的是  别再责怪自己了
Doesn't matter. What matters is, you've got to stop blaming yourself.

50
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:07,952
否则  你真会吃死自己
If you don't, you'll eat yourself into an early grave for no reason.

51
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,121
你可以看穿我的脑袋  停
You're looking in my head! Stop it!

52
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:13,267
别看了  你不需这样
Don't look in there. You don't have to do it, Barry.

53
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:14,963
别管我
Leave me alone!

54
00:04:17,306 --> 00:04:19,240
这不是你的错
It wasn't your fault.

55
00:05:06,088 --> 00:05:07,646
小琼
Jonesy?.

56
00:05:32,181 --> 00:05:34,411
最近好吗  亨利
Hey, how are you doing, Henry?

57
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:35,982
你说什么
What's that you say?.

58
00:05:36,152 --> 00:05:38,120
你聋了吗  我问你好不好
Are you going deaf? How are you doing?

59

You know. SSDD.

60

可不是嘛
Well, yeah, of course.

61
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,321
这个周末有空的话   咱们去看看阿逹
Hey, you know, I was thinking if you were free this weekend we might go see Duddits.

62
00:05:48,531 --> 00:05:52,058
好啊  我挺想他的
Yeah, absolutely. He's been on my mind a lot too.

63
00:05:52,234 --> 00:05:54,225
很久没见到他了
It's been a long time.

64
00:05:55,204 --> 00:05:56,466
进来
It's open!

65
00:05:58,707 --> 00:06:02,541
不说了  有点事要处理  星期六见
I gotta go. I got a thing here. I'll see you Saturday.

66
00:06:02,711 --> 00:06:03,700
好的
Yeah, right.

67
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,858
星期六见
See you Saturday.

68
00:06:18,094 --> 00:06:20,619
我说  迪克先生
So, Mr. Defuniak...

69
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,756
我俩都是从缅因州来的
...do you know we're both escapees from Maine?.

70
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,135
你来自匹兹菲尔市
You're from Pittsfield.

71
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:41,516
你知道领奖学金的学生  作弊被抓到会怎么样吗
Do you know what happens to scholarship students caught cheating on exams?.

72
00:06:53,863 --> 00:06:57,799
那天你不是感冒吗  大卫  你根本没来考试
You had the flu that day, didn't you, David?. You didn't take the exam?.

73
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:05,231
你因为生病没参加考试  就交个报告做为补偿
You missed the test. And since you were ill, why not write me an essay instead?.

74
00:07:05,407 --> 00:07:08,535
用三千字描述诺曼底登陆的影响  马上去写
3000 words on the short-term results of the Norman Conquest.

75
00:07:08,711 --> 00:07:10,508
是的  教授
Go get started. Yes, sir.

76
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:13,147
这比滚回老家好多了吧
Better to be from Pittsfield than go back to it.

77
00:07:13,315 --> 00:07:15,078
谢谢  教授
Thank you, sir.

78
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:22,686
你怎么发现的  那天你根本不在
How did you know?. You weren't even there that day.

79
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:28,190
我就是有本事知道
Sometimes I just know.

80
00:07:46,582 --> 00:07:48,015
你好
Hello.

81
00:07:53,355 --> 00:07:54,652
这可能行不通
This probably won't work.

82
00:07:54,823 --> 00:07:58,691
千万别小看卖汽车的  我们喜欢接受挑战  我是彼特
Never start that way with a car salesman. We love challenges. Pete Moore.

83
00:07:59,161 --> 00:08:02,892
一个小时后  我要带人去看费莱堡的房子  很大一笔的佣金
In one hour I'm showing a house in Fryeburg. It's a big commission.

84
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:06,899
可是我弄丢了车钥匙  可以帮忙打一把吗
And I just lost my damn car keys. Could you possibly make me duplicates?.

85
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:10,232
这可要花一天的时间  天啊  我就知道
That takes at least a day. Oh, boy, I just knew it!

86
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:14,201
别紧张  崔希  或许我帮的上忙  我很会找东西的
Easy, Trish. Maybe I can help. I'm always good at finding things.

87
00:08:14,376 --> 00:08:18,608
我有告诉你名字吗  我不记得  我猜的
Did I tell you my name?. I don't remember-- I guessed.

88
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,540
我们找钥匙吧
Now, let's find those keys.

89
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:25,786
嗨  瑞秋  嗨  彼特
Hey, Rachel. Hey, Pete.

90
00:08:25,955 --> 00:08:29,618
看过了  我找不到  帮我想想
Miss, I looked again. I couldn't find them. Okay. I need your help.

91
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:32,556
当时你手上拿着咖啡  买了阿斯匹灵后
You had the coffee in your hand, bought aspirin...

92
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:35,424
走到车边才发现钥匙不见了
...went to your car, realized the keys were gone.

93
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,225
是不是这样  正确
That everything?. Yes.

94
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:44,399
这样问会有点奇怪  但可以帮助我思考
Look. This is gonna seem weird, but it's just a thing I do to help me think.

95
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,450
买阿斯匹灵前你买了糖果
You bought a candy bar before the aspirin.

96
00:09:05,861 --> 00:09:07,886
巧克力棒
Mars bar.

97
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,767
是你的车吧
Yours, right?.

98
00:09:22,544 --> 00:09:26,571
再问一个问题  我若找到钥匙  可以请你吃晚餐吗
One more question. If I find your keys, will you let me buy you dinner?.

99
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:28,341
西码头餐厅  六点半
West Wharf?. 6:30?.

100
00:09:28,517 --> 00:09:31,918
那里有本州最好吃的蛤蜊  就在你回程的路上
Best fried clams in the state?. It's right on your way back.

101
00:09:32,087 --> 00:09:34,385
好啊  没问题
Sure. Okay.

102
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:38,457
很好  太好了
That'd be nice. All right.

103
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,722
然后  你到这里  打开了包包
So you got here. You opened your purse.

104
00:09:42,898 --> 00:09:46,925
咖啡  糖果和阿斯匹灵  全都乱成一堆
Coffee, candy and aspirin, you're juggling it all around.

105
00:09:47,102 --> 00:09:48,660
就在这时候…
And that's when...

106
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,077
你把钥匙弄丢了
...you dropped your keys.

107
00:09:58,781 --> 00:10:00,578
运气好让我给找到了
It's just luck, is all.

108
00:10:04,987 --> 00:10:06,648
谢谢你
Thank you.

109
00:10:15,664 --> 00:10:20,624
西码头餐厅六点半  知道了
West Wharf, right?. Half past six?. You got it.

110
00:10:31,613 --> 00:10:33,638
又泡汤了
Another fuckarow.

有事吗  没事  你要回家看老婆和小孩
Wanna talk?. No, you're trying to get home.

114
00:11:27,636 --> 00:11:31,629
怎样真的  没什么事  回家吧
What's up?. Really, I got nothing. Go home.

115
00:11:31,807 --> 00:11:35,675
小琼  干嘛
Wait, Jonesy?.Yeah, Beav?

116
00:11:36,745 --> 00:11:40,806
小心点  小心什么
You be careful. Be careful of what?.

117
00:11:43,152 --> 00:11:44,949
我知道就好了
Wish I knew.

118

"闲闲无事  天天孵蛋"

119
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:18,082
你说什么
What did you say?.

120
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:20,988
我什么也没说
I didn't say anything.

121
00:12:21,156 --> 00:12:23,283
是啊  抱歉
Right. Sorry.

122
00:12:31,915 --> 00:12:33,143
我的天啊

123
00:12:34,751 --> 00:12:36,275
天啊

124
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,505
叫救护车  没救了
Somebody call an ambulance! lt won't do any good.

125
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:48,639
我稍不留神就听到撞击声  怎么会这样
I looked away for one second. Then I heard a thump. What happened?.

126
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:56,388
天啊  是琼斯教授
Oh, my God! Professor Jones!

127
00:12:56,558 --> 00:13:00,494
我才和他碰面的  他不能死
I just saw him. He can't die!

128
00:13:10,005 --> 00:13:11,472
让开
Clear!

129
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:15,676
没有用  没心跳  再试一次
No good. Flatline. Hit it again!

130
00:13:15,844 --> 00:13:17,311
让开
Clear!

131
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:21,745
救得活吗  不乐观  我想没救了
What do you think?. I think it's no good. I think he's gone.

132
00:13:23,252 --> 00:13:26,312
小心 "坏心" 先生

00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,884
别想搬那些
Jonesy, don't try to lift that stuff.

135
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:13,564
老毕  我先进去了  好的  待会见见
Beaver, I'm going in! All right, I'll see you in a second!

136
00:14:26,515 --> 00:14:29,814
昨晚做爱了  那可好
Got blown last night. Good for you.

137
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:33,682
第一次吗  去你的
First time?. Bite my bag.

138
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:39,083
玩宾果时认识的  跟她回去后翻云覆雨
Met some lady at bingo, went back to her place, turned into a nice fuckaree.

139
00:14:39,261 --> 00:14:42,628
这次没有败兴而归  那还用说
As opposed to a fuckarow. Obviously.

140
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:47,167
虽然勃起很好看  都很快从12点变到6点半
Though I've had perfectly good fuckarees turn into fuckarows in a flash.

141
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:49,668
试试看威而钢  威而钢
Try Viagra. Viagra?.

142
00:14:49,838 --> 00:14:52,136
威而钢让我整天都一柱擎天
I'm practically at full salute all day.

143
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:56,144
这个叫做什么来着  久举症
I'm.... What do you call it?. Privatic?.

144
00:14:56,712 --> 00:14:59,180
久硬症  亨利知道的
Prag-- Prasmatic?. Henry will know.

145
00:14:59,348 --> 00:15:02,476
记得你小时候吧  你有久举的困扰吗
-You're thinking of fourth grade. -You're having wood problems?.

146
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,778
没吃过威而钢吧  去你的  当然没有
You haven't tried it, have you?. Hell, no!

147
00:15:04,953 --> 00:15:10,186
吞下蓝色小药丸  就可以挺12个小时
Drop that little blue bomb, you're hard as a Louisville Slugger for 12 hours.

148
00:15:11,026 --> 00:15:12,084
12个小时
Twelve hours?.

149
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,787
我是指像猛男一样  你不需要它来增加性趣
I'm talking Yastrzemski. You don't have to need it to love it.

150
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:19,861
宾果你刚说宾果  在教会地下室玩的那种
Bingo?. Did you say bingo, like the game in church basements?.

151
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,137
很多妞的那种  小毕
There's trim there. Beaver!

152
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:26,337
我真悲哀  没妞可泡
I thought my deal was pathetic.

153
00:15:32,147 --> 00:15:36,049
你只管看着  不要插手  好吧
You just watch. That's your job. I'm fine.

154
00:15:38,353 --> 00:15:41,652
亨利  最近是否更想阿达
H, you been thinking about Duddits more than usual?.

155
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:46,659
记不记得说好周末要去看他的
Remember we were gonna go see him that weekend?.

156
00:15:46,828 --> 00:15:49,695
记得  然后我就被车撞了
I remember. Then I got hit.

157
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,531
跟你说件很奇怪的事
I gotta tell you something weird.

158
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:03,008
我被撞的那晚  站在路边  我看到阿达就在对街
The night I got hit, I was standing there and across the street, I saw Duddits.

159
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,007
就像第一次见到他的那样
Just like he was that day we first saw him back in Derry.

160
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:10,583
他大声求救  大家却视而不见
He was calling out for help and everyone was ignoring him.

161
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:14,085
然后他回头看我  直视着我
Then he looked over at me. He looked directly at me.

162
00:16:14,956 --> 00:16:17,823
他要我过去
And he motioned for me to come to him.

163
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:28,101
你相信我看到他吧
You believe I saw him, don't you?.

164
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,096
当然  我相信
Yes, sir, I do.

165
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:36,867
阿达很爱我  我知道  他爱我们大家
Duddits loves me, I know that. He loves us all.

166
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:43,078
他宁死也不会伤害我们
He would die before he'd ever hurt us.

167
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:47,181
他为何把我叫到路上  让我被车撞
So why was he calling me into the street to get hit?.

168
00:16:49,624 --> 00:16:52,491
可能还有很多事  我们并不了解
Maybe there's more to the story we don't get yet.

169
00:16:57,232 --> 00:16:58,893
你知道个屁  说说看
You don't know shit. Name it!

170
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:02,400
可以  但我们得先打个赌
I'll name it after we come up with a small wager.

171
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:04,095
就赌50元吧  什么主题
50 bucks. What's the subject?.

172
00:17:04,272 --> 00:17:07,139
电影里  大家一早起床
In the movies, when people wake up together...

173
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:10,073
就亲亲  搂抱和做爱
...they immediately start kissing and going at it.

174
00:17:10,245 --> 00:17:14,375
他们都不用先起床  上个厕所或刷个牙
But they never get up first, take a leak and brush their goddamn teeth.

175
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:17,575
不只是我个人认为  每个人起床后都该先这样
Which is pretty much necessary when you wake up.

176
00:17:18,086 --> 00:17:20,748
一直勃起不退叫做什么
What's it called when you got a constant woody?.

177
00:17:20,922 --> 00:17:24,085
久硬症  看吧  我是有久硬症
You mean priapism. See?. I'm practically priasmic.

178
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:25,726
那叫持续勃起症
Priapismic.

179
00:17:25,894 --> 00:17:28,829
管他的  反正就是很硬  你们就赌这个吗
Whatever! It's hard. That's what you're betting on?.

180
00:17:28,997 --> 00:17:34,264
不是  我得说出哪部电影  符合现实生活
No, I can name the one movie where they acknowledge the scuzzy facts of life.

181
00:17:34,436 --> 00:17:38,372
但是若没赌金  我赌两毛五  你赌两毛五  你赌50元
I'll give you a quarter. A quarter from you. 50 bucks from you.

182
00:17:40,408 --> 00:17:44,003
"海誓山盟"   "海誓山盟"   没听过
Promised Land. Promised Land?. Never heard of it.

183
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:47,146

Kiefer. From, I don't know, 1988 or something?.

185
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:53,977
电影里  梅格莱恩起床便说  "猫跑到哪里去了"
So Meg Ryan wakes up in the morning and says, ""Where's the cat?. ""

186
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,785
然后他问 "什么猫啊"  她说"在我嘴里大便的猫"
And he says, ""What cat?. "" And she says, ""The cat that shit in my mouth.""

187
00:17:59,728 --> 00:18:01,093
你输我50元
That will be 50 small.

188
00:18:01,263 --> 00:18:03,993
胡扯  你瞎编的  他有本事捏造吗
Bullshit! You made it up. Could Beaver make that up?.

189
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,932
免费提供你们电影知识
You can have that priceless piece of cinematic trivia absolutely free.

190
00:18:08,103 --> 00:18:12,164
这些资讯全记录在  "谁在乎" 记忆区中
I'm filing that in the ""Who-gives-a-shit"" section of my memory warehouse.

191
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:16,974
什么记忆区  你不记得什么是记忆区
What's the memory warehouse?. You don't remember?.

192
00:18:17,145 --> 00:18:19,909
我忘了  你忘了记忆区
I must've forgot. You forgot?.

193
00:18:20,081 --> 00:18:23,812
提示我就行了  别啰唆  就在脑袋里  我们每个人都有
Just remind me. Don't give me shit. It's in his head. We've all got one.

194
00:18:23,985 --> 00:18:26,249
有被破坏过吗  还没有
Hasn't that place been condemned?. Not yet.

195
00:18:26,421 --> 00:18:30,517
里面有太多东西了  新东西进来就得丢一些旧的
It's so crowded I have to throw something out every time I learn something new.

196
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:35,186
我买了手提电脑后  把歌词全放到电脑里
When I got my new laptop I had to throw out all my files of rock 'n' roll lyrics.

197
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:43,368
我的记忆区十年前被洪水冲走  没了
My warehouse was washed away in a flood about 10 years ago.

198
00:18:43,538 --> 00:18:46,632

I didn't know they had enough beer in Maine for a flood.

如果有无法忘怀的东西
No, if I really can't let go of something...

203
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:45,757
我脑中有一个私密办公室  我把所有秘密都藏在那里
...I sneak it back to an office where I keep my secret stuff.

204
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:06,454
你把阿达的记忆存在哪里
Where do you keep the stuff on Duddits?.

205
00:20:06,621 --> 00:20:10,887

He's got a special section all his own on the third level.

206

I can't stop thinking about the Duds lately. How about you guys?.

Why is Tina Schlossinger's pussy on the wall of Tracker Brothers?.

Got it. I'll make him eat this dog turd, then he can go.

234
00:21:56,498 --> 00:21:59,023
我要他把狗粪吃完才放他走  要不要分一半
You go now. Unless you want half.

235
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,760
趁还来得及  快闪吧

What will people say when we tell them what we caught you doing?.

241
00:22:19,854 --> 00:22:23,153
敢告诉任何人  你就死定了
You won't tell anybody anything because you'll be dead.

Pete can fly. When you come for us, all we have to do is get in your way.

244
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,261

他会跑回家告诉他妈
He's going straight to his house to tell his mother.

248
00:22:45,814 --> 00:22:48,078

She'll call the cops and then we'll see.

249
00:22:48,883 --> 00:22:51,078
你认识他  所以帮他  没见过
You know him, is that it?. Never saw him.

250
00:22:51,252 --> 00:22:55,882

Then why ask for trouble?. I mean, look at this moron!

He likes this attention. How do you know what he likes?.

252
00:23:02,797 --> 00:23:04,162

我准备去宣传了  就等你下令
I'm gone, Henry. Just say the word.

255
00:23:11,072 --> 00:23:14,906
何必呢  你们一定输的  因为这么做  是不对的
Why?. You'll lose! Why?.Because you can't do that! It's wrong!

256
00:23:15,076 --> 00:23:17,442
我要告诉全世界每一个人
And I'm gonna tell the world! Tell everybody!

257
00:23:20,415 --> 00:23:23,907
我们要离开吗  别让他们走  好好修理他们
You want us to leave, is that it?. No! Let's kick their asses!

258
00:23:31,292 --> 00:23:34,955
我们走吧  以后再找他算帐  懂吧
Let's go. We'll get him later. You know that.

259
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,030
以后再找你们算帐
Get you all later.

260
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:50,471
没事了  可以停了
It's okay. You can stop now.

261
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,610
想想办法  各位
Do something. Somebody!

262
00:23:54,315 --> 00:23:55,976
我有办法了
If I do...

263
00:23:57,485 --> 00:24:02,821
但是你们敢泄漏出去  以后就别当朋友了
...and you tell anybody, I'll never hang with you guys again.

264
00:24:25,413 --> 00:24:26,937
我从不知道小毕会唱歌
I never knew Beav could sing.

265
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:36,820
唱得真好  不要闹了  别笑我
Beaver, that's beautiful. I mean it. Not one word.

266
00:24:36,991 --> 00:24:38,754
小毕
Eaver!

267
00:24:38,993 --> 00:24:41,052
你已经有个歌迷了
You've got a fan.

268
00:24:41,696 --> 00:24:42,754
这是你的吗
This yours?.

269
00:24:57,478 --> 00:25:00,606
达格拉斯卡威尔  是你的名字吗  是啊
Douglas Cavell. That's your name, right?.

270
00:25:02,483 --> 00:25:03,916
我是阿达
I Duddits.

271
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:07,111
你说什么  我是阿达
What?. I Duddits!

272
00:25:07,288 --> 00:25:09,722
你是阿达   阿达
Duddits?. Duddits.

273
00:25:10,124 --> 00:25:12,115
来吧  我们送你回去
Duddits, we got to get you home.

274
00:25:23,705 --> 00:25:26,868
你们过来  把他留在那里
Hey, guys! Come here! Leave the kid there.

275
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:30,978
站在那  跟史酷比一起在这里
Stand right here, Duddits. Right here with Scooby, okay?.

276
00:25:50,832 --> 00:25:53,266
我的天  什么玩意
Jesus Christ bananas!

277
00:25:53,434 --> 00:25:56,096
不可能是蒂娜珍吧
No way is that Tina Jean Schlossinger.

278
00:25:56,271 --> 00:25:59,206
大概是她祖母吧
Maybe her grandmother. Good going, Beav.

279
00:25:59,374 --> 00:26:02,571
大老远跑来就为这个
Holy God. We came all the way here just for that?.

280
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:07,247
不是的  是为他来的
No. We came for him.

281
00:26:33,474 --> 00:26:35,942
彼特  你忘了热狗
Hey, Pete. You forgot the dogs.

282
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:44,808
天气要变坏了  两个暴风雪要来  从亚伯塔区开始  会有约8寸高的积雪
Weather moving in. Double storm. Alberta Clipper first, maybe eight inches...

283
00:26:45,153 --> 00:26:47,246
之后  东北方又会来另一个
...with a nor'easter on its tail.

284
00:26:48,423 --> 00:26:52,826
快回到木屋里去  正要回去  高先生
Get on back to the cabin, Henry. Heading straight there, Mr. G.

285
00:26:53,094 --> 00:26:54,891
别在耽搁了  不会的
Don't mess around. No, sir.

286
00:28:43,771 --> 00:28:45,238
慢慢来  老兄
Easy, fella.

287
00:28:45,406 --> 00:28:48,773
慢慢来  没事吧  你是对的
Easy. You're okay. You're all right.

288
00:28:49,277 --> 00:28:51,575
谢天谢地
Thank God. Thank God.

289
00:28:51,746 --> 00:28:55,341
谢天谢地
Gee, thank God!

290
00:28:55,516 --> 00:28:59,008
我昨天在树林里迷了路
I'm lost. I've been lost in the woods since yesterday.

291
00:28:59,187 --> 00:29:02,748
进屋去吧  会暖和些
Let's get you inside. Get you warm.

292
00:29:03,691 --> 00:29:07,058
怎么会迷了路  就是嘛
How would that be?. Sure.

293
00:29:21,275 --> 00:29:23,209
我帮你脱
Here, let me get that.

294
00:29:27,482 --> 00:29:32,749
瑞克麦卡西  盖瑞琼斯  大家都叫我小琼
Rick McCarthy. Gary Jones. But it's Jonesy to everybody.

295
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:37,584
我们的手机坏了  无法打电话求救
Our damn cell phones are on the blink now, so I can't call for help...

296
00:29:37,758 --> 00:29:39,555
但是车子会马上回来
...but our car will be back soon.

297
00:29:39,727 --> 00:29:44,289
没想到我会获救  我和同伴走失了
I didn't think I'd make it. I lost the folks I was with.

298
00:29:45,233 --> 00:29:48,100
被你救了  真是命大
You saved me, that's for sure.

299
00:29:49,804 --> 00:29:51,066
那是什么
What's that?.

300
00:29:52,507 --> 00:29:54,407
捕梦网
It's a dreamcatcher.

301
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:59,908
印地安的灵物  赶走恶梦用的
Indian charm. Catches nightmares...

302
00:30:00,481 --> 00:30:03,416
让你在这里很安全
...keeps them away. Keeps you safe down here.

303
00:30:03,584 --> 00:30:05,575
我的恶梦够多了
I've had enough nightmares.

304
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:12,354
我整晚一直在打嗝
Been doing that all night.

305
00:30:13,494 --> 00:30:15,485
我之前吃了些梅子
I ate some berries in the dark.

306
00:30:17,832 --> 00:30:20,494
大概梅子搞的鬼
I think they must have upset me.

307
00:30:44,492 --> 00:30:46,084
我知道你在想什么
I know what you're thinking.

308
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:50,560
一大早就喝酒  应该是有毛病  但我只有在这里才这样
Anyone who drinks at 11 a.m. needs to take the cure, but I only do it here.

309
00:30:51,065 --> 00:30:53,727
平常  下午之前我滴酒不沾
In the real world, I never drink till after 5:00...

310
00:30:53,901 --> 00:30:56,699
要是沾一滴  从此戒酒
...and if it ever does, I'm on the wagon for life.

311
00:30:57,338 --> 00:30:58,464
很高兴听你这么说
Glad to hear it.

312
00:31:02,043 --> 00:31:03,533
你怎么了
What's the matter with you?.

313
00:31:05,212 --> 00:31:08,704
大约六个月前   小琼被车撞的那天
About six months ago, the day Jonesy got hit...

314
00:31:08,883 --> 00:31:14,617
我对一个病人做了很可怕的事  我羞辱他  还把他赶出办公室
...I did something terrible with a patient. Humiliated him. Drove him out of the office.

315
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,780
他叫贝利纽曼
Barry Neiman.

316
00:31:17,258 --> 00:31:21,388
几天前  在报上看到他的消息  他吃太多而撑死
Couple days ago, I saw his picture in the paper. He ate himself to death.

317
00:31:22,496 --> 00:31:26,489
我可不用这个故事来卖车
Mind if I don't use that story next time I'm trying to sell a Mustang?.

318
00:31:27,034 --> 00:31:31,801
那个胖子吃死自己前  你一直都挺丧志的
Henry, you were a lead balloon long before this porker munched his way to eternity.

319
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:36,501
谢啦  你还真善解人意  太令人感动了
Thanks. You're a real comfort. You got a real delicate touch to you.

320
00:31:39,447 --> 00:31:43,440
吃点东西吧  老兄  有助恢复体力
Here you go, Rick, buddy. That will fix you up.

321
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:54,190
天啊  天气又要变坏了
Jesus Christ bananas! Some fuckarow this is turning into!

322
00:31:56,864 --> 00:31:59,662
谢啦  我想该有的都有了
Thanks a lot, Pete. Yeah, I think I got it all.

323
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,665
你到底怎么了
What happened to you?.

324
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:09,042
乔克雷敦  叫我小毕就行了
Hi. Joe Clarendon. Call me Beaver.

325
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:11,303
瑞克在林中度过了恐怖的夜晚
Rick here had a bad night in the woods.

326
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:13,037
欢迎
Welcome.

327
00:32:13,214 --> 00:32:16,615
冻伤的吗  吃花生酱引起的过敏
ls that frostbite?. No, I get the same thing from peanuts.

328
00:32:16,784 --> 00:32:17,876
这是过敏
It's allergy.

329
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,417
谁要起司三明治
Grilled cheese, anyone?.

330
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:27,220
汤就行了  谢谢  我要  端出来
No, the soup's fine for me, thanks. I'll bite. Sail it over here.

331
00:32:28,729 --> 00:32:33,063
我妈常喂我青豆汤  当我…
My mother used to feed me pea soup when I was feeling--

332
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,370
我的老天
Bitch in a buzz saw!

333
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:42,168
有史以来最大的打嗝声  世界冠军
I've heard some mighty burps in my time, but that's the blue ribbon.

334
00:32:42,343 --> 00:32:43,605
真不好意思
I am so embarrassed.

335
00:32:43,778 --> 00:32:45,746
瑞克在林中吃了些莓子
Rick ate some berries in the woods.

336
00:32:51,085 --> 00:32:52,313
天啊
Oh, my God!

337
00:32:53,688 --> 00:32:55,155
天啊  真恶心
Oh, my God, that's awful!

338
00:32:55,756 --> 00:32:56,848
真是抱歉
I'm so sorry!

339
00:32:57,024 --> 00:33:00,960
别担心  至少比闷在里面舒服
Rick, buddy, don't worry about it. There's more room out than in, anyway.

340
00:33:01,128 --> 00:33:03,995
你到底吃了什么  猪粪吗
What have you been eating, woodchuck turds?.

341
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,232
我觉得…
Know what I think?.

342
00:33:08,936 --> 00:33:12,428
你需要躺下  小憩一下
I think you need to lie down and take you a little nap.

343
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,331
有道理
You know, I bet you're right.

344
00:33:15,876 --> 00:33:17,434
大概是太累了
I'm just tired, that's all.

345
00:33:18,045 --> 00:33:20,775
去睡吧 我的帽子
Come on. My hat.

346
00:33:22,183 --> 00:33:23,514
小毕
Beaver?.

347
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,212
在这里
In here.

348
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:35,426
谢谢收留我  谢谢你们两位
Thank you for taking me in. Thank you both.

349
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:39,464
任何人都会这样做的  也许会  也许不会
Shit, anybody would have. Maybe. Maybe not.

350
00:33:40,134 --> 00:33:42,364
想吐的话这可用这个
All right, this is in case you have to urk...

351
00:33:42,536 --> 00:33:46,199
厕所在左边第三间
...if you can't get to the bathroom, which is the third door to your left.

352
00:33:46,373 --> 00:33:49,433
别走错第一间  在里头便便
If you go in the first, you'll take a shit in the closet.

353
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,969
有任何需要  我们就在外面
If you need anything, we're outside.

354
00:34:07,027 --> 00:34:08,585
天啊  真臭  我需要新鲜空气
Fuck me, give me some air!

355
00:34:08,763 --> 00:34:11,960
有防毒面具吗  这里需要清洁大队
We got any gas masks handy?. We need a biohazard team in here.

356
00:34:13,467 --> 00:34:17,403
想不想听听更可怕的事  不太想
Wanna hear what will freak you out more?. Not really.

357
00:34:17,872 --> 00:34:19,396
你看到他的肚子很大吗
You know his huge stomach?.

358
00:34:19,573 --> 00:34:23,907
他来的时候是正常的  但胸部很凸出
When he got here, his stomach was normal, but his chest was out to here!

359
00:34:24,078 --> 00:34:25,545
亨利在就好了
I wish Henry was here.

360
00:34:25,713 --> 00:34:27,408
他是心理医生  不是内科医生
He's a shrink, not an internist.

361
00:34:27,615 --> 00:34:30,743
他读过医学院  你呢
He went to med school. Did you?.

362
00:34:32,286 --> 00:34:34,117
我曾经考虑过…
I thought about it.

363
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:50,266
你最好开快一点
You better get a run at it.

364
00:35:00,281 --> 00:35:02,010
妈的  小心
Shit! Watch it!

365
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,377
我的天呀
What the hell?.

366
00:35:30,945 --> 00:35:36,383
你没事吧  我的腿断了  唉呀  我的腿
Pete, are you okay?. No, I broke my leg! Man, my damn leg!

367
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:39,519
好的  忍耐一下
Okay. Hang on. Hang on a second.

368
00:35:39,687 --> 00:35:41,917
卡住了  我不能  天啊
I'm caught! I can't--God!

369
00:35:49,296 --> 00:35:54,427
天啊  亨利  过来帮我一下
God. Henry! A little help here!

370
00:35:54,935 --> 00:35:56,994
等等
Hang on, Pete. Hang on.

371
00:35:57,171 --> 00:36:01,005
我帮你解开安全带  我才刚开了啤酒
Okay. Here comes the seat belt. I just opened that beer.

372
00:36:03,177 --> 00:36:04,804
我扶你
I got you.

373
00:36:16,957 --> 00:36:18,652
腿如何
How's your leg?.

374
00:36:19,727 --> 00:36:24,426
没断  只是不能动
Well, it ain't broken. It's just locked up, is all.

375
00:36:44,351 --> 00:36:46,911
他该不会受到辐射污染吧
You don't suppose he got exposed to radiation?.

376
00:36:47,087 --> 00:36:51,387
我在电影里看过  电影中的那家伙后来头都秃了
I saw that once in a movie. Guy ended up bald as Telly what's-his-fuck.

377
00:36:51,558 --> 00:36:56,018
这个家伙头发很多  可是他的红疹越来越大
This guy's got plenty of hair. But that red mark got bigger while I was watching it.

378
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,527
你这是在干嘛  花生酱可以让我镇静下来
What are you doing?. Peanut butter calms me down.

379
00:37:04,204 --> 00:37:08,163
其他人还要吃呢  我会留一些
Somebody else might want to use that jar. I'll leave some.

380
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:11,700
小毕
Beav.

381
00:37:13,113 --> 00:37:14,637
小毕
Beaver.

382
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,715
干嘛大惊小怪
Criminettlies!

383
00:37:38,472 --> 00:37:40,372
我觉得是个女的
I think it's a woman.

384
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:44,710
我先告诉你  待会过去  我一定掐死这婊子
I ought to warn you. I'm gonna strangle this broad.

385
00:37:44,878 --> 00:37:47,779
我想她死了  我才不管
I'd guess she's already dead. I'll strangle her anyway.

386
00:37:47,948 --> 00:37:50,007
她差点害死我们
She almost got us both killed.

387
00:37:51,318 --> 00:37:54,810
哈罗  我们来了  别害怕
Hello! Here we come, ma'am. Don't be startled.

388
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,923
哈罗
Hello?.

389
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,600
算了  她死了
Forget it, H. She's gone.

390
00:38:13,607 --> 00:38:15,234
哈罗
Hello!

391
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:23,449
听得到我说话吗  你没事吧  听得到我说话吗
Ma'am, can you hear me?. Are you okay?. Can you hear me?.

392
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:30,050
我想这里都是这样打招呼的
I wonder if maybe that's how they say hello around here.

393
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:34,058
这位小姐  你差点害死我们
Listen, Miss Road Kill, you almost got us dead.

394
00:38:35,162 --> 00:38:37,096
出点声啊
Say something.

395
00:38:38,098 --> 00:38:41,090
我必须找到瑞克
I have to find Rick.

396
00:38:44,004 --> 00:38:46,734
好的  瑞克
Okay. Rick.

397
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,815
我的老天爷
Fuck me, Freddy.

398
00:39:03,223 --> 00:39:07,159
那些动物身上的红疹  就像瑞克脸上的
What's all that red stuff on their fur?. Just like McCarthy's cheek.

399
00:39:07,761 --> 00:39:11,788
从来没见过这样的情形  连熊看起来都很害怕
I never saw anything like this before. Even the bears look scared.

400
00:39:11,965 --> 00:39:15,457
他们要去哪里  我倒不担心他们逃去哪里
Of what?. Where are they going?. It's not where that worries me...

401
00:39:15,636 --> 00:39:18,127
而是他们为什么要逃离
...it's what are they running away from?.

402
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,945
搞什么
What the hell?.

403
00:39:30,484 --> 00:39:33,544
太好了  他们可以送瑞克去医院
This could be perfect. They can get Stinky to a hospital.

404
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,948
各位
Hey, you guys!

405
00:39:39,193 --> 00:39:44,654
我们需要帮忙  我们这里有个病号  这个区域暂时被隔离
We need some help! Got a sick guy inside! This area is under temporary quarantine.

406
00:39:44,832 --> 00:39:47,232
留在原地别动  什么隔离
Stay where you are. What quarantine?.

407
00:39:47,401 --> 00:39:51,804
我们这里有个病人  我们需要协助
We got a sick guy down here! We need your help here!

408
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:54,873
有个家伙病的很重  先把他送走吧
We got a real sick guy here! Take him with you now!

409
00:39:55,442 --> 00:40:00,573
还好你们没事  我们会在24至48小时内  把状况处理好
Glad you're okay. This situation will be resolved in 24 to 48 hours.

410
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:04,778
去你妈的
Kiss my bender!

411
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:33,371
我得问清楚  老兄  因为我实在很混淆
I gotta ask you, old buddy. Because I'm confused.

412
00:40:33,547 --> 00:40:37,881
这是 "闲闲无事  天天孵蛋"   当然不是
ls this SSDD or not?. Definitely not.

413
00:40:38,051 --> 00:40:39,712
今天的事可新鲜了
Different shit today, Pete.

414
00:40:39,887 --> 00:40:43,516
而且是相当怪异  如果你想知道
And a pretty weird day so far, if you want to know.

415
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:45,453
过来到这里
Over here.

416
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:51,597
小心
There you go.

417
00:40:52,699 --> 00:40:54,291
慢点
Easy.

418
00:40:59,273 --> 00:41:04,540
小木屋距这里有九英哩  我想应该没问题
It's nine miles to Hole in the Wall. I think I can manage it.

419
00:41:05,512 --> 00:41:08,037
我去把雪车开来接你们
I'll bring the snowmobile back and get you both.

420
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:12,208
彼特  听我的话  不要回车上拿啤酒
Now, Pete, you listen to me. Don't go back to the car for beer.

421
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:17,790
陪着她  别让她冻着  我发誓绝不会  戴医师
Stay with her. Keep her warm. Right hand to God, Dr. D.

422
00:41:18,525 --> 00:41:19,787
亨利
Henry!

423
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,224
万一你还没回来我们就死了
If we die before you get back...

424
00:41:22,963 --> 00:41:26,262
你保证让大伙知道  她不是我的妞
...promise you'll tell everybody she wasn't my date.

425
00:41:35,209 --> 00:41:38,303
告诉你  小琼  我真受不了这样
I'm telling you, Jonesy, I don't like this at all.

426
00:41:38,478 --> 00:41:42,778
真是屋漏偏逢连夜雨  倒楣透顶
This is turning into a double fuckarow. A real jobba-nobba.

427
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:53,745
瑞克  还好吧  有点不舒服
Rick, you okay?. I'm a little sick, fellas.

428
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,050
想清一清肠胃  瑞克  开门啊
I just need to make a little room. McCarthy, Rick, open up, man.

429
00:42:58,225 --> 00:43:00,989
走开  再不开我们就冲进去了
Go away! Open the door or we break it down.

430
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:04,790
我不能有点隐私吗  你哪边流血了吗
Can't a man have some privacy?. Rick, where are you bleeding from?.

431
00:43:04,965 --> 00:43:08,423
流血  我没有流血
Bleeding?. I'm not bleeding.

432
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:15,073
把门撞开  我不知道该不该进去
Let's do it. I'm not positive I wanna go in there.

433
00:43:15,242 --> 00:43:19,338
万一他快死了怎么办   "史酷比狗狗  准备干活了"
What if he's dying?. Scooby-Dooby-Doo, we got some work to do now.

434
00:43:19,713 --> 00:43:22,273
我数到三  准备好了没
On three. Ready?.

435
00:43:22,582 --> 00:43:26,018
一   二
One.... Two....

436
00:43:26,653 --> 00:43:29,520
等等   如果撞不开
Hold it! What if we just bounce off?.

437
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:35,127
不全力以赴  就没乐趣  没错  这样才有乐趣
No bounce, no play. Right. No bounce, no play.

438
00:43:35,829 --> 00:43:37,490
一
One....

439
00:43:37,964 --> 00:43:41,365
二   三
And a two.... Three!

440
00:43:48,975 --> 00:43:52,035
天啊  我的妈
Oh, fuck! Oh, man! Fuck!

441
00:43:52,312 --> 00:43:54,780
我不想看这个  我不敢看
I don't want to see this! I can't see this.

442
00:43:54,948 --> 00:43:58,509
闭嘴  先生  他还活着吗
Shut up a minute. Mr. McCarthy?. Rick?. ls he still alive?.

443
00:43:58,685 --> 00:44:01,813
不知道  瑞克
I don't know. Rick?. Rick, are you--?.

444
00:44:02,456 --> 00:44:06,153
还能拉屎  应该还活着
Oh, man! Jonesy, if he can still do that, he must be alive.

445
00:44:06,326 --> 00:44:08,419
听得见吗  我想他死了
Can you hear me?. I think he's dead.

446
00:44:08,595 --> 00:44:10,893
胡扯  他刚刚还拉了屎  听得见
Bullshit! He dropped a clinker! I heard it.

447
00:44:11,064 --> 00:44:14,625
那不是拉屎  太过分了  快回答我
I don't think that was a clinker. That's enough, snap out of it!

448
00:44:15,469 --> 00:44:17,835
天啊
Oh, my God! My God!

449
00:44:21,908 --> 00:44:23,842
不  不
No! No?.

450
00:44:26,546 --> 00:44:31,040
干得好  把它困住了  除了化粪池它别无去处
Good move! It's trapped. Got nowhere to go but the septic tank.

451
00:44:56,343 --> 00:44:58,106
妈的
Oh, shit!

452
00:44:58,678 --> 00:45:02,114
听着  小毕  我们要换手  什么
Listen, Beaver, we're gonna change places. What?.

453
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:04,648
你去储藏室   我才不要
One of us is gonna go to the shed. No way!

454
00:45:04,818 --> 00:45:07,514
闭嘴听好  那里面有胶带
Shut up and listen! There's friction tape there.

455
00:45:07,687 --> 00:45:10,383
去拿来  我们把盖子封死
You go get it, come back. We'll tape the lid down.

456
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:12,751
这样我们就可逃出去
Then we're gonna get the hell out of here!

457
00:45:13,593 --> 00:45:16,391
你去拿胶带  别逞英雄
You get the tape, Jonesy. Don't be brave, Beav.

458
00:45:16,563 --> 00:45:18,929
你跑的比我快  我会压住盖子
You're faster than me. I'll sit on Thumper.

459
00:45:19,099 --> 00:45:22,227
不要  万一它跑出来  你无法光用屁股对付它
No, if it does get out, you can't fight it. Not with your hip.

460
00:45:22,736 --> 00:45:25,603
天啊  快去
Oh, my God! Goddamn it! Go!

461
00:45:36,917 --> 00:45:38,748
可是  小毕
And Beav?. Yeah?.

462
00:45:38,985 --> 00:45:40,953
坐稳了  兄弟
Sit tight, buddy.

463
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,183
没事的
Okay.

464
00:46:39,913 --> 00:46:42,404
行了
All right. Okay.

465
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:54,759
该死  马桶战士琼斯  回答我  小琼
Shit! Earth to Jonesy! Come in, Jonesy!

466
00:47:06,806 --> 00:47:10,401
小琼  小琼
Jonesy. Jonesy.

467
00:47:13,013 --> 00:47:16,073
我要镇静
Calm down now. Okay.

468
00:47:17,551 --> 00:47:18,848
好了
Okay.

469
00:47:19,452 --> 00:47:23,115
好了  就差一点
Okay, here it is. Okay.

470
00:47:28,361 --> 00:47:30,591
快找胶带
Find the damn tape!

471
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:45,429
在哪里
Where is it?.

472
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:50,635
我来了
Coming, Beav!

473
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:09,557
小毕  小毕
Beaver! Beav!

474
00:49:09,896 --> 00:49:12,364
我找到   天啊
I got the-- What the--

475
00:49:19,205 --> 00:49:20,604
小琼  快离开
Jonesy, get out of here!

476
00:49:21,574 --> 00:49:22,666
小毕
Beaver.

477
00:49:22,909 --> 00:49:25,810
快走  把门关上  不
Get out! Shut the door! No.

478
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:28,878
快跑  小琼
Run, Jonesy.

479
00:50:28,074 --> 00:50:30,099
你把他杀了
You killed him.

480
00:50:30,243 --> 00:50:32,734
你杀死小毕
You killed Beaver.

481
00:50:32,912 --> 00:50:35,437
你把他杀了  你这王八蛋
You killed him, you fuck!

482
00:52:06,172 --> 00:52:08,732
你想干嘛
What do you want?.

483
00:53:33,893 --> 00:53:37,590
他把那红疹叫 "莉普蕾"   是"异形"女主角的名字
The men call the red stuff Ripley, after the broad in the Alien movies.

484
00:53:37,764 --> 00:53:40,324
我们会消灭  从隔离区逃出的动物
We eradicate the animals as they flee the Blue Zone.

485
00:53:40,466 --> 00:53:41,592
那居民呢
And the populace?.

486
00:53:41,734 --> 00:53:45,932
会把他们带到高林超商  直到想出解决方法才放人
We're bringing civilians to Gosselin's. We'll detain them till we figure this out.

487
00:53:46,105 --> 00:53:51,566
对付外星人的事就交给你  就这么办  伙伴
And Owen?. This time the ETs belong to you. That's right, bucko.

488
00:53:51,744 --> 00:53:53,837
你就是蓝色精英部队的队长  终于等到了
You'll be Blue Boy leader. Finally.

489
00:53:54,013 --> 00:53:56,538
还剩几个  大约一百个
How many left?. About a hundred.

490
00:53:56,716 --> 00:54:00,083
数量不致造成威胁
Yeah. Not nearly enough for a serious incursion.

491
00:54:00,253 --> 00:54:02,517
我猜是因太空船坠落造成的
My guess is, it's a crash-landing.

492
00:54:02,689 --> 00:54:06,284
他们不会在这样的地形  或气候中降落
They've never picked terrain like this before. Or cold weather.

493
00:54:06,459 --> 00:54:07,790
您的指示
What's your call?.

494
00:54:07,961 --> 00:54:11,055
让他们逃出隔离区就麻烦了
The biggest threat is them getting out of our net.

495
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:13,027
不管是不是意外坠机
Crash-landing or not...

496
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:15,997
他们会想办法逃出来   散播病毒 "隔离区"
...they'll try to get out and spread the infection.

497
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:21,774
我就说他们绝不会无缘无故来  除非是想占领这世界
I always say they never visited a world they wouldn't rather own.

498
00:54:22,542 --> 00:54:24,976
老技俩
They're up to their old tricks.

499
00:54:25,211 --> 00:54:27,873
装成普通人的模样
Using a standard grayboy look...

500
00:54:28,047 --> 00:54:32,245
有着一对天真无邪的眼睛  像婴儿般光滑的皮肤
...with the innocent doggy eyes and smooth baby-butt skin.

501
00:54:32,418 --> 00:54:35,285
他们呈现出人类的样子
They project what they think we want to see.

502
00:54:35,455 --> 00:54:40,085
但我看过他们的真面目  你绝对不会想把妹妹嫁给他
But I've had a look at the real thing. You wouldn't want it marrying your sister.

503
00:54:40,693 --> 00:54:46,256
"莉普蕾"有不同的看法  真的谁有意见
Difference of opinion about the Ripley. Really?. Who has an opinion?.

504
00:54:46,432 --> 00:54:48,696
你想会是谁呢  麦迪森将军
Who do you think?. General Matheson.

505
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:52,326
三星上将麦迪森  三星
Three-star General Matheson. Three?.

506
00:54:52,839 --> 00:54:56,366
你什么时候见过他  昨天他们召我去问话
When did you see him?. They called me in yesterday.

507
00:54:56,542 --> 00:54:59,511
那些家伙能有什么的意见
What's the opinion of those enlightened cocksuckers...

508
00:54:59,645 --> 00:55:01,545
他们根本就没接触过外星人
...who've never been near an ET?.

509
00:55:01,714 --> 00:55:05,741
不是所有受害都会长红疹  有些人没有长
They say the fungus doesn't take hold in all victims. Some of them get over it.

510
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:08,913
真的吗  那么那些怪物呢
Really?. And what about the shit weasels?.

511
00:55:09,088 --> 00:55:11,420
那些从屁眼拉出怪物的人呢
The ones blasting out the basement door?.

512
00:55:11,591 --> 00:55:14,583
麦迪森该不是认为  那些人已经康复了
Does Matheson think folks get over one of those puppies?.

513
00:55:14,761 --> 00:55:20,631
他们认为只有少数受感染的人  会散布病毒  不是所有人
Their theory is, they'll only grow in a small percentage of the exposed population.

514
00:55:21,567 --> 00:55:24,127
你同意那个论调吗
Do you like that theory, bucko?.

515
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,232
我想那是胡扯
I think it's crap.

516
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:32,935
你有办法掌控
So if you thought someone had been exposed...

517
00:55:33,112 --> 00:55:36,912
和外星怪物接触过的人  我不准他们在外面游荡
...and you had them in your grasp-- I wouldn't want them walking out...

518
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:43,215
看来我们的想法是一样的
...to wander as they wish. Bucko, I think we're on the same page.

519
00:55:43,623 --> 00:55:46,217
志同道合
Pissing in the same latrine.

520
00:55:46,659 --> 00:55:51,187
万一 "莉普蕾" 从林区中逃出
If the Ripley gets out of this pine-tree paradise....

521
00:55:51,364 --> 00:55:54,765
绝对不允许这种情形发生
Well, it just can't be allowed to do that.

522
00:55:55,868 --> 00:55:58,860
我已隔离了整个区域
I've quarantined the entire area.

523
00:55:59,338 --> 00:56:02,671
任何人插翅也难飞  知道了  老大
Nothing leaves alive. Roger that, boss.

524
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:04,436
进来
Come!

525
00:56:06,145 --> 00:56:08,238
梅普带来了  长官
Got Maples here, boss.

526
00:56:08,915 --> 00:56:12,749
我是下士梅普  长官  我知道你是谁  梅普
Corporal Maples, sir. I mean, boss. I know who you are, Maples.

527
00:56:12,919 --> 00:56:17,822
蓝色精英的每一成员  都是我亲自挑选出来的  有时候我也怀疑自己的判断力
I handpicked every man in Blue Boy group. Sometimes I wonder about my judgment.

528
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:21,721
是的  老大  对不起  是长官  你清楚蓝色精英的信仰吗
Yes, sir. I'm sorry, boss. Do you know the Blue Unit catechism?.

529
00:56:21,861 --> 00:56:25,353
清楚  长官  是全队伙伴信念一致  蓝色精英是陆军的一部分吗
Yes, the B.U.C. for all buckos. ls Blue Unit part of regular Army?.

530
00:56:25,498 --> 00:56:27,898
不是  是更优秀的  蓝色精英如何运作
No, boss. Better. How does Blue Unit operate?.

531
00:56:28,067 --> 00:56:32,595
秘密行动时  我们互不相认  也不显示阶级  我们没有老大  我们是独立的个体
Under the radar. We do not salute, display rank, say ""sir."" A force unto ourselves.

532
00:56:32,738 --> 00:56:35,002
一般军队和蓝色精英相比  逊毙了
Regular Army compared to Blue Unit?. Pussies.

533
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:38,167
我们根据什么法则运作  战斗法则
Under what rules does Blue Unit operate?. Rules of combat.

534
00:56:38,344 --> 00:56:39,834
这就对了  小伙子
That's right, laddie.

535
00:56:40,213 --> 00:56:44,047
一个士兵若不遵守上级指令  会使所有人身处于险境
When a soldier disobeys a superior's orders, he puts everyone at risk.

536
00:56:44,217 --> 00:56:47,778
他会被上级立刻处分
And is to be punished immediately by appropriate command personnel.

537
00:56:47,954 --> 00:56:50,445
那就是我
That's me. Capisce? Good.

538
00:56:50,723 --> 00:56:53,851
回答我一个问题  你就可以滚了
Now answer me one question and you can boogie out of here.

539
00:56:54,026 --> 00:56:56,654
但你必须老实回答
But you have to answer honestly.

540
00:56:58,397 --> 00:57:04,029
今早六点你站岗时  在14号蓝色隔离区
You were on containment detail at 06:00 this morning, sector 14 of Blue Zone.

541
00:57:04,203 --> 00:57:07,297
是否准许一个女人  带着她的四岁女儿
Did you allow a young woman and her 4-year-old daughter...

542
00:57:07,473 --> 00:57:11,569
开着车离开蓝色隔离区
...to exit the zone in their own vehicle on Hickam Valley Road?.

543
00:57:11,944 --> 00:57:14,845
克提斯上校  她从未到过禁区
Colonel Curtis, she hadn't been in the zone.

544
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:18,040
她只是开错方向  绝不是被隔离的人
She made a wrong turn. She couldn't have been contaminated.

545
00:57:18,217 --> 00:57:21,345
这是实际发生  还是她告诉你的
You know this for a fact?. Or because she told you so

546
00:57:21,721 --> 00:57:24,747
实际发生  长官  你敢以童军名誉发誓
For a fact, boss. Scout's honor

547
00:57:27,291 --> 00:57:32,490
你敢发誓告诉我  你说的是有事实根据
Can you raise your hand and tell me honestly that you know this for a fact?

548
00:57:37,301 --> 00:57:39,098
那就发誓  梅普
Then do it, Maples.

549
00:57:39,503 --> 00:57:42,529
发誓吧  以童军名誉
Swear on it. Scout's honor.

550
00:57:48,746 --> 00:57:50,145
以童军名誉
Scout's honor.

551
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:55,608
别鬼叫了  小子
Stop your blatting, laddie-buck!

552
00:57:56,587 --> 00:57:58,680
你刚逃过一次军事审判
You just avoided a court-martial, boy.

553
00:57:58,856 --> 00:58:01,689
你如果敢再欺骗我  就准备万箭穿心吧
You lie to me again, you'll be facing a firing squad.

554
00:58:01,859 --> 00:58:05,454
趁我还没改变心意前  把他带走  让他离开这里
Get him out before I change my mind. Let's get him out of here.

555
00:58:05,829 --> 00:58:07,387
哨兵
Sentry!

556
00:58:18,108 --> 00:58:20,668
天啊  亚伯  我警告过他
Jesus, Abe. I warned him.

557
00:58:20,844 --> 00:58:23,608
他算是逃过一劫
Could have gotten off with a slap on the wrist.

558
00:58:24,148 --> 00:58:27,584
你毁了他的手  他跨越了我定下的界限
lnstead of taking his whole hand?. He crossed the Curtis line!

559
00:58:27,951 --> 00:58:30,613
竟敢在我的地盘撒谎
He came into my house, told me lies.

560
00:58:31,021 --> 00:58:33,387
他当我是疯子啊  是有点疯
You think I'm crazy, Owen?. A little.

561
00:58:37,761 --> 00:58:41,595
我是发了火  但那小子太糟糕了
I lost my temper there. But that little worm did something worse.

562
00:58:41,965 --> 00:58:44,365
竟让那个女人离开
The pretty mom he let pass this morning?.

563
00:58:44,535 --> 00:58:47,902
目前她在谷仓里  被 "莉普蕾" 缠上了
She's down at the barn right now crawling with the Ripley.

564
00:58:48,072 --> 00:58:49,733
二十五年了
Twenty-five years, Owen.

565
00:58:49,907 --> 00:58:54,037
二十五年来都在对抗  那些外来的混帐东西
Twenty-five years I've been going out to fight these alien bastards...

566
00:58:54,211 --> 00:58:58,773
我要让他们知道  他们挑错地方  敲错门了
...show them they picked the wrong place, knocked on the wrong fucking door.

567
00:58:58,949 --> 00:59:02,112
老实说  小伙子  我有点倦了
And frankly, laddie, the tank is running a little low.

568
00:59:02,286 --> 00:59:06,780
幸好  在这复杂险境中  还有让人高兴的事
Luckily for me, there's one bit of good news in this blizzard of bullshit.

569
00:59:07,124 --> 00:59:12,221
我有接班人  今天你来带队攻击  明天由你接管我的工作
I have you. To lead the assault today and to take over for me tomorrow.

570
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:16,566
你在说些什么  这是我最后一次任务
What are you talking about, Abe?. It's my last dance, Owen.

571
00:59:16,734 --> 00:59:21,137
从现在起  就由你来带头
From now on, you will lead the band.

572
00:59:22,406 --> 00:59:24,738
知道这是哪弄来的吧   约翰韦恩送的
You know where I got that?. John Wayne.

573
00:59:24,942 --> 00:59:29,072
没错  他给我的  现在我把它送给你
That's right. He gave it to me. And now I'm giving it to you.

574
00:59:29,279 --> 00:59:34,546
我不知该说什么  别感情用事了  伙伴
Abe, I don't know how to....Let's not get all girlie with each other.

575
00:59:34,718 --> 00:59:37,949
只要告诉我该怎么执行任务  攻击要迅速猛烈
Just tell me how we do it. We go in fast and hard.

576
00:59:38,122 --> 00:59:39,680
如何脱身  全身而退
How do we come out?. Clean...

577
00:59:39,857 --> 00:59:41,848
而且面带微笑
...and smiling.

578
00:59:59,877 --> 01:00:02,038
亲爱的  我回来了
Honey, I'm home.

579
01:00:11,755 --> 01:00:15,020
这样也不错  小眯一下
That's a good idea. Catch a little shuteye.

580
01:00:15,192 --> 01:00:18,787
才有元气放屁
Save your energy for those horrendous farts!

581
01:01:27,831 --> 01:01:34,202
你真会甜言蜜语  我觉得你也很有魅力
Well, it's very nice of you to say so. I find you very attractive also.

582
01:01:35,606 --> 01:01:40,009
你是少数会开  福特货车的女人
You're one of those rare women who can handle the full-size Ford Expedition.

583
01:01:40,177 --> 01:01:46,582
而且能把货车当轿车开  就像一辆高级豪华大轿车
The truck that handles like a luxury car. A really big luxury car.

584
01:01:51,388 --> 01:01:55,722
但  老实说  有件事我想提一下
But seriously, folks, there is one issue I'd like to bring up...

585
01:01:55,893 --> 01:01:59,829
以防万一我死在这里
...just in case I should, you know, kick the bucket out here...

586
01:01:59,997 --> 01:02:06,061
变成彼特冰封僵尸  那并不是不可能的
...turn into a goddamn Petesicle. Not that I think that's inevitable.

587
01:02:06,236 --> 01:02:10,673
我相信亨利  小琼或小毕  很快就会来救我们
I'm sure Henry or Jonesy or Beaver will be coming to get us soon.

588
01:02:11,608 --> 01:02:14,702
他们都是我的朋友  是我最要好的朋友
They're my friends. We're all best friends.

589
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:20,611
小姐  恕我直言
Now, ma'am, I'll be very candid with you about this...

590
01:02:20,784 --> 01:02:25,585
所以拜托  别吓到  或把我当成怪胎
...so please, don't get freaked out or think that I'm some kind of weirdo...

591
01:02:25,756 --> 01:02:28,816
或拒绝跟我晚餐约会
...who you shouldn't meet for the best fried clams in Maine.

592
01:02:28,992 --> 01:02:32,553
即使只是吃个单纯的晚餐
Just some innocent fried clams at the West Wharf!

593
01:02:34,331 --> 01:02:36,492
我们这四个好朋友
You see, the four of us, best friends...

594
01:02:36,667 --> 01:02:39,932
有个共同的朋友叫阿达
...we all have this other friend by the name of Duddits.

595
01:02:40,103 --> 01:02:44,631
这个朋友阿达  并不是你想像的普通朋友
And our friend Duddits, well, he's not your average old buddy.

596
01:02:45,676 --> 01:02:51,546
很久以前  有一天  他送我们每人一个礼物
One day, a long time ago, he gave us all this kind of gift.

597
01:02:51,715 --> 01:02:55,207
这礼物  该怎么说呢
It's this.... How shall I put it?.

598
01:02:55,819 --> 01:03:01,280
是一种特异功能
This ability. This ability to know things...

599
01:03:01,458 --> 01:03:05,724
我们有看透事情的能力  不需透过言语就能彼此交谈  就像心电感应
...to talk to each other without talking at all, just mind-to-mind.

600
01:03:05,896 --> 01:03:08,558
知道我在说什么吗
Do you see what I'm getting at?.

601
01:03:15,472 --> 01:03:17,337
我就知道你会了解
I knew you would.

602
01:03:18,642 --> 01:03:21,440
最近我常做一个梦
Lately, I've been having this dream...

603
01:03:21,611 --> 01:03:27,572
梦里  我明白阿达  为何能把这样的能力传给我们
...and in the dream, I understand how Duddits could give us a gift like that.

604
01:03:28,785 --> 01:03:31,686
我觉得阿达不是地球人
I think maybe our friend Duds is not from this planet.

605
01:03:31,855 --> 01:03:34,289
他是从其他星球来的
I think Duddits is from somewhere else...

606
01:03:34,458 --> 01:03:39,919
他来协助我们  对抗某些东西
...and he came here to prepare us for something.

607
01:03:44,267 --> 01:03:45,894
是不是有点疯狂
It's crazy.

608
01:03:46,970 --> 01:03:50,497
跟你谈论一个世间仅有的完人
Talking shit about the only perfect person I ever knew.

609
01:03:51,508 --> 01:03:56,571
他太完美了  真不敢相信他是人类
He's so goddamned good. I can't believe he's a human.

610
01:03:58,215 --> 01:04:02,208
我应该赞扬他  而不是质疑  他来自哪个银河系
I should be singing his praises, not questioning what galaxy he's--

611
01:04:02,386 --> 01:04:03,944
我想小便
I gotta pee.

612
01:04:07,858 --> 01:04:09,052
先去解决吧
That's what I should be doing.

613
01:04:20,804 --> 01:04:22,431
敬你  阿达
Here's to you, Duds.

614
01:04:24,041 --> 01:04:26,236
人类的完美杰作
The highest civilian decoration.

615
01:04:37,687 --> 01:04:39,587
上帝  我再也不喝酒了
Lord, I will never drink again.

616
01:05:42,185 --> 01:05:43,675
我把话说明白
Let me get this straight.

617
01:05:43,854 --> 01:05:48,882
昨天你要退出  宣告放弃  不再留恋
Yesterday you want to call it quits, throw in the towel, pull the plug, curtains.

618
01:05:49,059 --> 01:05:54,691
今天你却苦苦哀求祷告  再几小时  再几英哩
Today, you're begging, praying. Couple more hours. Couple more miles.

619
01:05:54,865 --> 01:05:56,992
快下决定
Make up your mind.

620
01:05:58,735 --> 01:06:01,568
小琼  行了  混蛋
Jonesy! Way to go, motherfucker!

621
01:06:01,738 --> 01:06:03,501
"拯救世界的任务"
Here you come to save the day!

622
01:06:03,588 --> 01:06:05,852
"太空飞鼠来了"

623
01:06:07,978 --> 01:06:09,377
搞什么
What the hell?.

624
01:06:11,014 --> 01:06:13,073
"外星" 人是谁
Who's Mr. Gray?.

625
01:06:14,284 --> 01:06:16,684
你想告诉我什么  小琼
What are you trying to tell me, Jonesy?.

626
01:06:18,822 --> 01:06:20,756
你不是小琼
You're not Jonesy.

627
01:06:58,261 --> 01:07:01,389
搞什么  琼斯先生  我们刚刚路过了什么
What was that, Mr. Jones?. What did we just pass on the road?.

628
01:07:01,998 --> 01:07:06,662
你在跟我说话吗  是啊  是跟你说话  琼斯  还是该叫小琼呢
Are you speaking to me? Yes, I am, Mr. Jones. Or is it Jonesy?.

629
01:07:06,836 --> 01:07:10,772
你的朋友都这样叫你吧  交个朋友吧
That's what your friends call you, isn't it?. Let's be friends.

630
01:07:11,241 --> 01:07:14,233
为何让我活下来  我要借用你的身体
Why are you letting me live? I'm borrowing you.

631
01:07:14,411 --> 01:07:19,542
我们去兜一兜风  小毕从未伤害过任何人  你却把他杀了
We're going to take a little journey. Beaver never hurt a soul and you killed him.

632
01:07:19,783 --> 01:07:23,549
他没什么大脑  我在你这里找到有用的东西
He had nothing in his head. I've found something useful in yours.

633
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,980
去你的  我知道那是什么意思
Fuck you! I know what that expression means.

634
01:07:27,157 --> 01:07:30,490
我研究过你的脏话记忆区
I've studied the foul language section of your memory warehouse.

635
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:35,962
老实说  不怎么样  这个如何 "外星"人  吃屎吧
Rather distasteful, I must say. How about this, Mr. Gray?. Eat shit and die.

636
01:07:39,202 --> 01:07:41,466
为何叫我 "外星"人
Why did you call me Mr. Gray?.

637
01:07:41,638 --> 01:07:44,573
小心 "坏心"(外星)人
Watch out for lster Gay.

638
01:07:45,141 --> 01:07:48,941
有人跟你提过我  是谁告诉你的
Someone told you about me. Who told you about me?.

639
01:07:49,179 --> 01:07:51,613
想知道的话  自己解读
If you want to know, why don't you read my mind?.

640
01:07:51,915 --> 01:07:54,645
你居然能对我隐藏心思
Surprisingly, you're able to keep things from me...

641
01:07:54,818 --> 01:07:58,015
我不懂  但很快就会找到答案
...I don't understand it. But I'm sure I'll figure it out soon.

642
01:08:18,975 --> 01:08:20,670
彼特  天啊
Oh, Pete, Jesus!

643
01:08:20,844 --> 01:08:23,472
那妖怪想咬断我老二
Motherfucker tried to bite my dick off, Jonesy.

644
01:08:23,647 --> 01:08:26,172
我以为只有我前妻会这样
I always thought it would be my ex-wife did that.

645
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:29,580
我带你去看医生
Let's get you to some help.

646
01:08:31,988 --> 01:08:34,320
还分的清路吗
Can you still see the line, buddy?.

647
01:08:35,125 --> 01:08:39,824
没路我也到的了高林超商  我知道  但是
I don't need the line to get to Gosselin's. No, I know that, but...

648
01:08:39,996 --> 01:08:44,262
我们不去高林超商  你能带我上95号公路
...if we didn't want to go to Gosselin's, how would you get us out to 95?.

649
01:08:44,434 --> 01:08:48,734
95号  谁管去哪里  我很痛
95?. Who gives a shit?. I'm hurting here, Jonesy.

650
01:08:51,574 --> 01:08:53,201
怎么了
What's wrong with you?.

651
01:08:56,046 --> 01:08:58,480
你并不是  住嘴  你伤得太重了
Wait a minute, you're not-- Shut up, Pete.

652
01:08:58,648 --> 01:09:01,014
不知道自己在胡说些什么
You're too messed up to know what you're saying.

653
01:09:01,184 --> 01:09:05,644
为时已晚  彼特  我要你立刻上车
Too late for that. Pete, I need you to get onto the snowmobile right now.

654
01:09:05,889 --> 01:09:09,347
你他妈的是谁  说话口气很像007
Who the fuck are you?. You sound like one of those James Bonds!

655
01:09:09,526 --> 01:09:13,018
这一定和大鳗鱼有关  你该不会是…
This has to do with the fucking eel, doesn't it?. You're not--

656
01:09:18,668 --> 01:09:22,661
住手  我会说服他帮忙  告诉他怎么走
Stop it! I'll get him to help. Pete, tell him what he wants to know.

657
01:09:32,615 --> 01:09:37,712
怎么上95号公路  我得去麻州
Now, Pete, which way to l-95?. I need to go to Massachusetts.

658
01:09:58,975 --> 01:10:02,172
这是特异功能
My, my. That is a gift.

659
01:10:03,012 --> 01:10:04,741
谁教你的
Who taught you that?.

660
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:12,450
以后得靠你帮忙了
You're gonna be a big help, Pete.

661
01:10:14,991 --> 01:10:16,720
坐上来
Climb aboard.

662
01:10:33,109 --> 01:10:36,169
表演结束了  老兄  让我进去
Show's over out there, buddy. Let me in. Let me in.

663
01:10:36,346 --> 01:10:39,907
里面到底有什么
What have you got in that part of your mind, professor?.

664
01:10:40,083 --> 01:10:43,644
你的记忆资料都在这里吧
Your memories are out here in the warehouse, aren't they?.

665
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:47,779
是谁叫你防着我  又是谁教彼特那些技俩
I want to know who warned you about me. And who taught Pete that nifty trick?.

666
01:10:47,957 --> 01:10:51,484
我相信答案就在这里  我会花点时间找到答案的
I'm sure the answers are here. It'll just take me a while to find them.

667
01:10:51,661 --> 01:10:53,652
找到答案  让我进来吧
To find them. Think about letting me in.

668
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:56,822
这样才有礼貌
It's the polite thing to do. Polite thing to do.

669
01:12:00,430 --> 01:12:02,261
小毕
Beav!

670
01:12:37,133 --> 01:12:38,760
这是什么玩意
What is this?.

671
01:13:09,032 --> 01:13:10,465
小毕
Beav.

672
01:13:11,568 --> 01:13:13,331
他妈的
Shit!

673
01:13:17,607 --> 01:13:19,734
怎么会这样
Fuck me, Freddy.

674
01:14:33,416 --> 01:14:35,247
妈的
Asshole!

675
01:16:52,255 --> 01:16:55,691
再见  小毕  我爱你  兄弟
So long, Beav. Love you, man.

676
01:17:11,808 --> 01:17:13,275
我们把它做成了艺术品
We all made them in art.

677
01:17:13,442 --> 01:17:15,637
我先做完的  送了一个给阿达
I finished first, so I made one for you, Duds.

678
01:17:15,812 --> 01:17:18,713
我做错了  想不起来线要怎么接
Mine's deformed. I couldn't figure out the string.

679
01:17:19,782 --> 01:17:25,220
毕佛  亨利  琼斯  彼特  没错  好家伙
Eaver, Henny, Ownzy, Eet! That's right, my man.

680
01:17:25,955 --> 01:17:27,513
是我阿达
I Duddits.

681
01:17:28,291 --> 01:17:31,158
是的  我是阿达  我是阿达
Yes. I Duddits. I Duddits!

682
01:17:32,161 --> 01:17:34,561
我是阿达
I Duddits!

683
01:17:37,133 --> 01:17:39,192
阿达会找到她的
Duds will find her. How?.

684
01:17:39,368 --> 01:17:42,098
阿达无所不能  她是启智学校的
He can do anything. She's from the Retard Academy.

685
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:45,365
总是爱挥着手  我们得救这女孩
She always waves. We've gotta save this girl.

686
01:17:48,044 --> 01:17:51,377
救 "地球"  不是"地球"  是个女孩
Save this world?. Not the world, Duds. A girl.

687
01:17:51,547 --> 01:17:54,414
以后再去拯救地球  "坏心"人
We'll save the world some other time. lster Gay?.

688
01:17:54,584 --> 01:17:56,950
是啊  很离奇  你要帮我们
Yeah, it's a mystery. We need you to solve it.

689
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:59,610
捕梦人  阿达能读我们的心思  又来了
Dreamcatcher. Duds'll read our minds. Not this again.

690
01:17:59,789 --> 01:18:01,654
住嘴  我们得想想裘丝的处境
Shut up. We gotta think of Josie.

691
01:18:01,824 --> 01:18:04,054
裘丝…
Josie, Josie, Josie.

692
01:18:05,394 --> 01:18:08,124
裘丝瑞肯赫尔
""Josie Rinkenhauer.""

693
01:19:03,486 --> 01:19:07,183
裘丝  没错  你能找到她吗
Josie?. That's right. Can you find Josie?.

694
01:19:48,731 --> 01:19:51,529
"这简直太疯狂了"  再说一次
This is completely crazy. You can say that again.

695
01:19:51,701 --> 01:19:54,101
我什么都没说  "有  你有说  我听到了"
I didn't say anything. You did. I heard you.

696
01:19:54,270 --> 01:19:58,536
"你说  这简直太疯狂了"  我可没那样说
You said, "This is completely crazy "I didn ' t say that.

697
01:19:59,475 --> 01:20:01,466
我只是想想而已
I thought it.

698
01:20:02,411 --> 01:20:07,644
去你的  只有阿达会读心术  我们可没这本事
Kiss my bender. Duds can hear people's thoughts. We can't.

699
01:20:07,984 --> 01:20:09,542
"你确定吗  小毕"
Are you sure of that, Beav?

700
01:20:54,964 --> 01:20:58,024
大伙  裘丝一定在这里
Hey, guys! She's down here for sure!

701
01:21:10,413 --> 01:21:11,937
裘丝  你在里面吗
Josie, you down there?.

702
01:21:13,315 --> 01:21:16,580
裘丝
Josie! Josie!

703
01:21:19,121 --> 01:21:21,385
她一定在下面
Fuck me, Freddy, she's down there.

704
01:21:21,557 --> 01:21:25,357
我知道  我脑袋有她的影像
I know it. I can see her in my head.

705
01:21:25,528 --> 01:21:28,224
我也是
Yeah. Me too.

706
01:21:28,798 --> 01:21:31,961
救命  拜托
Help! Please!

707
01:21:32,134 --> 01:21:35,626
救救我  忍耐一下  我们来了
Help me. Hold on, Josie, we're coming!

708
01:21:35,805 --> 01:21:38,171
裘丝  撑着点
Josie, hang in there!

709
01:21:44,013 --> 01:21:45,878
别唱了  她已经够害怕了
Don't sing. She's scared enough.

710
01:21:46,048 --> 01:21:50,781
闭嘴  这里有老鼠屎的味道  抓住我的脚
Shut up. There's like rat shit in here. Hold on to my feet!

711
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:53,185
小毕  看到什么了没有
Pete, do you see anything?

712
01:21:54,090 --> 01:21:59,289
阿达  我们救到她了  救了裘丝
Duds! We got her! Here's Josie.

713
01:22:32,628 --> 01:22:35,392
蓝色精英队长  情况如何  兄弟
Blue Boy leader. How we doing, bucko?.

714
01:22:36,565 --> 01:22:41,832
没问题  老大  迅速利落  果然是蓝色精英本色
Right here, boss. Fast and hard. Wouldn't have it any other way, Blue Boy.

715
01:22:43,539 --> 01:22:45,166
长官
Sir?.

716
01:22:47,543 --> 01:22:49,340
我看见了
I see it.

717
01:23:02,324 --> 01:23:03,848
请不要伤害我们  你们不会受感染的
Don't hurt us. We're dying.

718
01:23:04,026 --> 01:23:06,551
那是哪来的声音  不是从无线电发出来的
There is no infection here. Whose radio is that?.

719
01:23:06,762 --> 01:23:09,663
他们把声音  直接传到我们脑里
It's not the radio. They're putting it into our heads.

720
01:23:09,899 --> 01:23:12,060
我们非常无助  没错  各位
We are helpless. There it is, gentlemen.

721
01:23:12,234 --> 01:23:15,567
直接传入我们脑中
There's no infection here. Directly into our heads.

722
01:23:15,871 --> 01:23:18,339
这样你们明白  我们在对抗什么样的敌人
This gives you an idea what we're up against.

723
01:23:20,342 --> 01:23:23,402
你们是不是纳闷  为什么那些可怜的家伙
If anybody's thinking, Those poor, helpless little folk...

724
01:23:23,579 --> 01:23:27,675
会裸着身体  不带武器  在坠毁的太空船边
...all naked and unarmed beside their crashed intergalactic Winnebago...

725
01:23:27,850 --> 01:23:30,842
是什么冷血怪物…
...what kind of a dog, what kind of a monster...

726
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:33,784
即使听了他们无助的告白  也无动于衷
...could hear that heartbreak and go in just the same?

727
01:23:33,956 --> 01:23:39,053
我就是那冷血怪物  我们非常无助  就快死了
Well, I'm that dog. I'm that monster. We are helpless. We are dying.

728
01:23:39,228 --> 01:23:42,061
他们像披着羊皮的狼
These mothers are as harmless as a fox in a henhouse.

729
01:23:42,231 --> 01:23:45,098
而我就是来对付这些狼  听懂我在说什么吗
And I'm here to kick some ass! Are you with me?.

730
01:23:45,267 --> 01:23:47,064
是的  老大  听到了
Yes, boss! Roger that, boss.

731
01:23:47,303 --> 01:23:48,463
老大说的是
Right on, boss.

732
01:23:49,538 --> 01:23:51,631
请不要伤害我们
Don't hurt us.

733
01:23:56,045 --> 01:23:57,842
我看到了
I have a visual.

734
01:24:00,883 --> 01:24:02,646
天啊
Holy shit!

735
01:24:02,818 --> 01:24:04,752
妈啊  真壮观
Damn, look at the size of that.

736
01:24:06,222 --> 01:24:10,818
蓝色精英  这是队长  目标接近  进入4级备战状态
Blue Boy group, this is Blue Boy leader. Target imminent. Move to level 4 readiness.

737
01:24:10,993 --> 01:24:13,154
兄弟们  锁定目标  准备发射
Gentlemen, lock and load.

738
01:24:15,097 --> 01:24:16,428
飞弹就绪
Hellfires are hot.

739
01:24:18,133 --> 01:24:19,395
发令攻击  欧文
Sing it out, Owen!

740
01:24:19,902 --> 01:24:25,465
蓝色精英  这是队长  我们要扫遍整片林子  把那些废物清除掉
Blue Boy group, this is Blue Boy leader. Clean up the forest and get rid of this trash!

741
01:24:25,641 --> 01:24:28,235
别伤害我们  拜托  别伤害我们
Don't hurt us. Please, don't hurt us.

742
01:24:28,410 --> 01:24:31,470
我们不具传染性  我们很无助且濒临死亡
There is no infection here. We are helpless.

743
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:34,248
全力射击  开火
Fire at will! Fire!

744
01:25:47,523 --> 01:25:49,514
叫他们撒走
Owen, get them out of there!

745
01:25:50,726 --> 01:25:52,023
快爆炸了
It's gonna blow!

746
01:25:52,528 --> 01:25:56,191
蓝色精英  立刻撒退  重复  停止攻击  撒退
Blue Boy group, withdraw at once. I repeat, cease firing and back off!

747
01:25:56,365 --> 01:25:58,731
差一点就能全部歼灭  这是自动引爆
We can get them! It's self-destructing. Back off!

748
01:25:59,134 --> 01:26:01,967
赶快撒离  我们就在敌人上方
Blue Boy group, get out of there! We're on top of it!

749
01:26:02,871 --> 01:26:04,771
欧文  撒离
Owen, pull out now!

750
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:08,273
撒离  快离开  正在撒
Pull out! Get out of there! Pull out!

751
01:26:35,037 --> 01:26:40,100
琼斯  我一直想起我们的朋友  "史酷比"小子
Jonesy, I've been thinking about our friend. Our Scooby-Doo buddy.

752
01:26:40,709 --> 01:26:44,440
我早就认为  他是来向我们预警某些事情的
For a long time I thought he was sent to us to warn us about something.

753
01:26:44,713 --> 01:26:47,682
但一直不知道是什么事  别谈他的事了
I could never figure what it was. Don't talk about him.

754
01:26:47,850 --> 01:26:52,082
直到今天我才了解  当前所发生的事
Not till today. It was this, right now.

755
01:26:52,821 --> 01:26:58,123
就是他要警告的  彼特  说说你那朋友吧
He wanted to warn us. Go ahead, Pete. Tell me about your friend.

756
01:26:58,293 --> 01:27:03,253
是他教你那些漂亮的把戏  不是  琼斯说的没错
Did he show you that nifty trick?. No. Jonesy's right.

757
01:27:03,699 --> 01:27:07,795
来吧  彼特  我们来谈谈嘛  操你妈  王八蛋
Come on, Pete. Let's talk. Bite my bag, motherfucker!

758
01:27:11,673 --> 01:27:16,940
好啊  我也会操  我操你全家
All right, Pete, I'll bite. Your bag and everything else.

759
01:27:20,883 --> 01:27:24,046
不  你这混蛋
No, no! You bastard! No!

760
01:27:32,995 --> 01:27:34,929
彼特
Pete.

761
01:28:23,912 --> 01:28:26,244
别跟他说话  快走
Don't talk to him! Get out of there!

762
01:28:30,619 --> 01:28:33,213
怎么样  老兄  谢天谢地你来了  长官
What's up?. Thank God you came by, governor.

763
01:28:33,522 --> 01:28:36,116
我的车坏了  人生了无生趣
I'm broke down here and fearing for my life.

764
01:28:36,792 --> 01:28:38,419
这只狗真漂亮
That's a good-looking dog.

765
01:28:38,594 --> 01:28:40,653
你们去哪里   高林超商
Where you headed?. Gosselin's.

766
01:28:40,829 --> 01:28:43,423
你会去那附近吗
Any chance you're going near there?.

767
01:28:43,899 --> 01:28:45,628
我正要去那里
That's where I'm going.

768
01:28:46,535 --> 01:28:50,232
你后车门好像开着
Well, I believe your tailgate has come open.

769
01:28:56,712 --> 01:28:58,441
我检查一下
Let's take a look.

770
01:29:06,121 --> 01:29:09,215
我看你是要运货到蓝色基地
I see you have some cargo you're taking to Blue Base.

771
01:29:33,115 --> 01:29:35,481
我有好东西给你吃
Got a treat for you, lke.

772
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:43,050
吃到饱  吃那红色的东西
All you can eat. Eat all the red stuff.

773
01:29:44,726 --> 01:29:50,460
好狗狗  乖狗狗
Good doggy. Yes. Good boy.

774
01:29:51,066 --> 01:29:55,332
吃多一点  好吃好吃
Have your fill. Tasty, tasty.

775
01:29:55,504 --> 01:29:57,563
想吃多少就吃多少
Eat all you want--

776
01:30:00,542 --> 01:30:05,172
小琼  你要干嘛
Jonesy. What are you up to?.

777
01:30:40,482 --> 01:30:41,881
琼斯
Jonesy!

778
01:31:02,904 --> 01:31:04,633
天啊
Oh, God!

779
01:31:56,992 --> 01:32:01,088
别动  否则开枪了  不准离开隔离区
Halt or we'll fire! You cannot leave the quarantine zone!

780
01:32:01,263 --> 01:32:03,390
别动   我已经不动了
Halt! I think I just about halted here.

781
01:32:09,037 --> 01:32:10,561
跟我来  欧文
Come with me, Owen.

782
01:32:10,739 --> 01:32:13,765
让你看些东西  可是你一定不会想看
I'll show you things you'll wish you'd never seen.

783
01:32:28,990 --> 01:32:31,720
我们要在这待多久  就快结束了
How long we gotta be here?. lt'll be all right.

784
01:32:36,298 --> 01:32:39,893
我要见我的律师  他们一定有什么
I demand to see my lawyer! There must be something they can do.

785
01:32:42,204 --> 01:32:43,967
不要担心  会好起来的
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

786
01:32:44,172 --> 01:32:46,265
我们什么时候可离开  几小时内吧
When do we get out?. Within hours.

787
01:32:46,441 --> 01:32:50,673
在美国境内  你不可以这样拘留人  我叫你待在这里
You can't do this to people in America! I told you to stay over there!

788
01:32:50,846 --> 01:32:53,314
这是我老婆  政府会不惜一切代价
My wife-- Government's doing everything they can...

789
01:32:53,482 --> 01:32:56,508
救你们出去  我们会竭尽所能
...to get you out of here. Please don't worry. It's all right.

790
01:32:56,685 --> 01:32:59,245
保障你们安全无虑
We're doing everything to make sure you're safe.

791
01:32:59,421 --> 01:33:02,288
几个小时内  就能把你们送回家
We'll get you back to your homes within hours.

792
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:13,561
没感染
All clear.

793
01:33:36,091 --> 01:33:38,855
有事吗  先生  叫什么名字
Can I help you, sir?. What's your name?.

794
01:33:39,027 --> 01:33:43,054
亨利  亨利戴夫林医生  是医生  太好了
Henry. Dr. Henry Devlin. A doctor?. Good.

795
01:33:43,231 --> 01:33:44,892
我们这里需要医生
We need doctors in there.

796
01:33:46,768 --> 01:33:49,293
来吧  老弟  我们喝一杯
Come on, laddie, I'll buy you a cup.

797
01:33:51,306 --> 01:33:55,936
先生  你从哪来的  波士顿
You, sir, where you from?. Boston.

798
01:33:56,611 --> 01:34:02,174
波士顿  很棒的城市  我们很快就会送你回去
Beantown?. Great city. We'll have you back there in no time.

799
01:34:02,350 --> 01:34:04,181
大概明早以前
Maybe by morning.

800
01:34:05,287 --> 01:34:07,221
快点
Hurry up, bucko.

801
01:34:17,666 --> 01:34:20,362
你看到小孩脸上的东西吗
You see that crud on the faces of children...

802
01:34:20,535 --> 01:34:24,699
你知道我为什么喜欢乡下  因为乡下才能这么干
...you know why I relish a turn in the country like we had today.

803
01:34:25,674 --> 01:34:30,202
你表现的很好  我感到非常骄傲
You were excellent out there, O. It made me feel very proud to--

804
01:34:33,148 --> 01:34:36,982
亚伯  你还好吗
Abe?  Abe, you okay?

805
01:34:38,386 --> 01:34:40,377
亚伯
Abe?

806
01:34:47,262 --> 01:34:52,598
我很好  对于这种任务  我可能太老了
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. I must be getting too old for this shit.

807
01:34:53,735 --> 01:34:56,533
不知道怎么回事
I don't know what the hell that was about.

808
01:35:10,485 --> 01:35:12,817
我别无选择
It's the only way, Owen.

809
01:35:13,622 --> 01:35:16,284
我们必须隔离消毒整个地区
We've got to cauterize the site.

810
01:35:17,893 --> 01:35:19,884
他们全都得死
They've all got to die.

811
01:35:21,296 --> 01:35:22,888
只能这样
It's the only way.

812
01:35:23,131 --> 01:35:24,928
我们还不确定他们是否被感染
But we don't know that.

813
01:35:25,133 --> 01:35:29,570
研究报告指出  受感染的人极有可能复原
The studies point to the strong possibility of recovery for many exposed subjects.

814
01:35:29,738 --> 01:35:32,468
那些研究报告可靠吗  这不就是答案
The studies show squat, that's what they show.

815
01:35:32,641 --> 01:35:35,872
过去25年工作  如果是由三星上将麦迪森执行
If Matheson had been in my spot for the last quarter-century...

816
01:35:36,011 --> 01:35:38,639
你根本活不到现在
...you'd have never made it to your first jerk-off.

817
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:43,449
那些灰着脸的外星浑蛋  早就把你们当午餐吃了
Those gray bastards would have had you for lunch back in Armpit, Kentucky.

818
01:35:43,618 --> 01:35:46,951
有些人已经好多了  至少一半的人  几天内就会康复
Some get better. At least half will be over it in a few days--

819
01:35:47,122 --> 01:35:49,317
谁好了呢  泰瑞莎修女
Which ones, Mother Teresa?.

820
01:35:49,491 --> 01:35:53,757
你敢保证   他们不会把传染病带回家
Can you guarantee they won't take it home like a present for the family?.

821
01:35:53,962 --> 01:35:57,864
我告诉你该担心什么   该注意什么
I'll tell you what you should be worried about. What should be on your mind.

822
01:35:58,033 --> 01:35:59,660
不是这些少数的不幸事件
Not these few unfortunates.

823
01:36:00,135 --> 01:36:02,695
而是该担心的那些  搭便车的外星浑蛋
What you should be worried about is a hitchhiker.

824
01:36:02,871 --> 01:36:04,338
你说什么  搭便车
What?  A hitchhiker.

825
01:36:04,506 --> 01:36:07,600
我们最害怕的是这些浑蛋会藉着
Our greatest fear is that a grayboy would catch a ride...

826
01:36:07,776 --> 01:36:11,769
人的身体离开这里而不被发现
...with somebody and would carry them out of here, without being consumed.

827
01:36:12,047 --> 01:36:15,073
也会藉着人类散布病毒   就像散播种子般
To scatter the infection, like Johnny-fucking-Appleseed.

828
01:36:15,250 --> 01:36:17,514
你确定没有这样的人逃走  没有
Are you sure there isn't such a person?. No.

829
01:36:17,686 --> 01:36:20,246
即使有  也插翅难飞
But I am sure that if there is one he won't get out.

830
01:36:20,422 --> 01:36:23,118
况且我们在隔离区  布下了天罗地网
Not with the net my boys put up around the Blue Zone.

831
01:36:23,391 --> 01:36:26,189
能不能歼灭所有受感染的人
And if we do a thorough job on the ones we've got.

832
01:36:26,361 --> 01:36:30,764
能不能不要太感情用事  尤其我们的任务  是在保护整个地球
If we don't get gooey about the little picture when our job is taking care of the big one.

833
01:36:31,433 --> 01:36:32,764
懂吗
Capisce?

834
01:36:33,168 --> 01:36:37,127
你若觉得这对我来说很容易  那你就大错特错
Owen, if you think this is easy for me, you're crazier than my mother was.

835
01:36:38,707 --> 01:36:40,299
那些可怜的家伙
Those poor schmucks.

836
01:36:41,109 --> 01:36:44,875
开着雪佛兰的车子  在便宜的商店购物
They drive Chevrolets, shop at Wal-Mart...

837
01:36:45,046 --> 01:36:47,037
从不错过 "六人行" 影集
...never miss an episode of Friends.

838
01:36:48,116 --> 01:36:49,981
他们是一般的平民百姓
These are Americans.

839
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:53,915
射杀同胞…
The idea of slaughtering Americans...

840
01:36:56,725 --> 01:36:58,955
让我倒尽胃口
...it just turns my stomach.

841
01:37:02,998 --> 01:37:07,230
但我仍得执行  因为不做不行
But I'll do it. I'll do it because it needs to be done.

842
01:37:08,703 --> 01:37:13,163
凌晨2点开始行动  2点半就能结束  之后什么都不用烦了
So if we start at 2, we can be done by 2:30. And it's all behind us.

843
01:37:14,109 --> 01:37:16,100
剩下的只是梦魇
Except for the dreams.

844
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:21,480
对啊   除了梦魇
Yeah, except for them.

845
01:37:33,728 --> 01:37:37,129
你要怎么跟老婆说  你的所作所为
What are you gonna tell Rita about what you did here?

846
01:37:37,432 --> 01:37:40,993
如果你女儿问起  你要怎么跟她说
What are you gonna tell Katrina when she's old enough to ask?

847
01:37:44,672 --> 01:37:49,268
你认识我吗  我不记得何时见过面  但你认识我
You know me, don't you?. I don't remember when we met, but you know me.

848
01:37:49,511 --> 01:37:53,413
我们别浪费时间了  我直接了当告诉你吧  你有两个难题
We don't have time to screw around. You've got two problems.

849
01:37:53,581 --> 01:37:56,880
一个你很清楚  一个你并不知道  继续说
One you know about, one you don't. Go ahead.

850
01:37:57,485 --> 01:38:03,321
你的师父克提斯上校  追捕外星人25年  已经疯了
Your mentor, Colonel Curtis, he's gone insane from hunting aliens for 25 years.

851
01:38:03,491 --> 01:38:07,484
如今要你帮他  滥杀几百个无辜的百姓
Now he wants you to help him kill hundreds of innocent people.

852
01:38:08,563 --> 01:38:10,554
你是谁  我
Who are you?  Me?

853
01:38:10,732 --> 01:38:13,724
这个待会再讨论   我们先离开此地
Talk about that later, once we get out of here.

854
01:38:14,702 --> 01:38:17,728
我可以预测你的想法  欧文
You're predictable. You won't let me burn on this fence...

855
01:38:17,906 --> 01:38:20,568
你不会让我被这栅栏电死的  你更不会帮克提斯滥杀无辜
...any more than you'll help Curtis kill those people.

856
01:38:20,742 --> 01:38:24,508
你现在心里想的是  袋子里的卫星数位无线电
What you're thinking now is whether that digital sat-scan transmitter...

857
01:38:24,679 --> 01:38:27,739
是否能联络到某人
...in your duffle bag will let you get through to somebody.

858
01:38:28,783 --> 01:38:31,752
一个叫麦迪森将军的人
Somebody named General Matheson.

859
01:38:35,056 --> 01:38:40,460
"有时我们必须杀人"  "但真正的目的是去救人"
"Sometimes we have to kill, but our real job is to save lives."

860
01:38:44,632 --> 01:38:46,930
你爸爸是个很棒的军人
Your father was a great soldier.

861
01:38:47,402 --> 01:38:48,869
这是他生前的最后一句话
Those were his last words.

862
01:38:49,037 --> 01:38:51,198
你一直带着他的相片
You carry his picture with you always.

863
01:38:54,342 --> 01:38:55,969
把真相告诉我
Tell me everything.

864
01:38:57,145 --> 01:38:59,079
你会救这些人
You'll save these people.

865
01:38:59,247 --> 01:39:02,705
我们一谈完  快用无线电连络麦迪森…
When we're done talking, get on the transmitter, contact Matheson.

866
01:39:02,884 --> 01:39:04,146
大队人马会到达
Cavalry rides in.

867
01:39:04,319 --> 01:39:07,618
第二个难题来了
That takes care of problem number one. Now comes the hard part.

868
01:39:07,789 --> 01:39:12,351
你真以为封锁了感染途径  没有所谓搭便车的外星人
You think the infection's been contained, that there's no hitchhiker.

869
01:39:12,527 --> 01:39:16,224
你错了  我最好的朋友已经被上身
You're wrong. He's riding with my best friend on Earth.

870
01:39:16,397 --> 01:39:19,298
他叫盖瑞琼斯  他已经不是他了
A guy named Gary Jones. And he's out there.

871
01:39:19,868 --> 01:39:24,202
如果不马上逮到他  我就快感应不到他了
You and I don't get after him right away, he'll get out of my range...

872
01:39:24,405 --> 01:39:27,340
到时地球的麻烦可大了
...and some kind of shit is gonna hit the planetary fan.

873
01:39:41,723 --> 01:39:43,850
我们的梦魇
Our nightmare hitchhiker.

874
01:39:44,459 --> 01:39:49,988
所以那密医要一张通行证  好去抓他朋友
And all Dr. Mystery wants is a free pass so he can catch his friend.

875
01:39:50,165 --> 01:39:53,430
说的容易  不是我相信他  你该听听他的说词
Very convenient. I'm saying you ought to hear his story.

876
01:39:53,835 --> 01:39:55,268
好啊  他人在哪
Okay. Where is he?

877
01:39:55,436 --> 01:39:57,233
我让人把他带到车库
Had him taken to the tractor shed.

878
01:39:57,705 --> 01:40:01,106
好吧  我会和他谈谈  再和你对质
Okay. I'll check him out and we can compare notes.

879
01:40:01,276 --> 01:40:02,971
悉听尊便  老大
Whatever you say, boss.

880
01:40:09,851 --> 01:40:13,252
快点  别再浪费时间了
Come on, come on. Time's a-wasting.

881
01:40:23,198 --> 01:40:25,325
好了  士兵  开门
All right, lad, open up.

882
01:40:43,751 --> 01:40:45,048
波士顿来的医生
Dr. Boston?.

883
01:40:46,454 --> 01:40:47,785
你在里面吗
Are you in here?.

884
01:40:49,190 --> 01:40:50,657
我在这里
I'm here.

885
01:40:50,792 --> 01:40:52,089
我还能在哪里呀
Where I've been put.

886
01:40:53,261 --> 01:40:55,491
竟在自己家里当起囚犯
A prisoner on my own damn property.

887
01:41:00,268 --> 01:41:01,599
走吧
Let's go!

888
01:41:03,304 --> 01:41:04,703
快点  走吧
Come on, let's go.

889
01:41:11,346 --> 01:41:12,904
上车
Get in!

890
01:41:15,016 --> 01:41:16,745
你差点撞到我了
You almost ran me down.

891
01:41:16,918 --> 01:41:19,819
我以为会你感应到我
Figured you'd read my mind and get out of the way.

892
01:41:22,924 --> 01:41:27,759
蓝色精英部队  原地不动  你们要听从陆军的指挥
Blue Unit, stand down. You are under regular Army command.

893
01:41:27,929 --> 01:41:29,920
立刻放下武器
Put down your weapons at once.

894
01:41:30,999 --> 01:41:33,524
你们的任务已经取消了
Your mission is rescinded.

895
01:41:33,701 --> 01:41:37,034
蓝色精英任务已经不存在了
This is no longer a Blue Unit operation.

896
01:41:37,205 --> 01:41:42,336
放下武器  重复一次  放下武器
Put down your arms. Repeat, put down your arms.

897
01:41:42,510 --> 01:41:45,741
一切听从麦迪森将军的指令
General Matheson has assumed command.

898
01:41:55,123 --> 01:41:56,385
很好  欧文
Okay, Owen.

899
01:41:57,058 --> 01:41:58,355
很好
Okay.

900
01:41:59,060 --> 01:42:02,188
你刚越过了我的界限
You just drove over the Curtis line.

901
01:42:04,365 --> 01:42:06,230
去哪  南方
Where we going?. South.

902
01:42:06,401 --> 01:42:09,165
目前唯一知道的  只要接近琼斯
All I know right now. Just get me in range of Jonesy...

903
01:42:09,337 --> 01:42:11,237
就可以知道一切真相
...we'll know everything we need to know.

904
01:42:34,962 --> 01:42:37,760
那支枪有来头  借看一下
That's some gun. Can I have a look?.

905
01:42:45,039 --> 01:42:48,372
你用这枪  很炫  别人送的
Kind of flashy for a guy like you, isn't it? It's a gift.

906
01:42:48,543 --> 01:42:50,204
我知道
I know.

907
01:42:52,380 --> 01:42:53,870
你到底在哪里  小琼
Where are you, Jonesy?

908
01:42:54,048 --> 01:42:57,108
拿起电话  打亨利专线给我
Pick up the phone. Call 1 -800-HENRY.

909
01:43:13,634 --> 01:43:15,568
喂  小琼吗
Hello? Jonesy!

910
01:43:15,737 --> 01:43:19,434
天啊  我就知道是你  他把你带到哪去了
Jesus Christ, I knew it was you. Where's he taking you?

911
01:43:20,208 --> 01:43:22,403
麻萨诸塞州吗  是吗
Massachusetts? He is?

912
01:43:22,710 --> 01:43:26,237
阿达吗  好的  我会来救你  你撑着点  小琼
Duddits? Okay, I will. You hang in there, Jonesy.

913
01:43:26,414 --> 01:43:27,711
小琼
Jonesy?

914
01:43:28,383 --> 01:43:29,782
他断线了
He hung up.

915
01:43:30,885 --> 01:43:32,546
把枪还给我
Give me back my gun.

916
01:43:34,822 --> 01:43:37,256
我们得去戴瑞市  他们要去那里吗
We gotta go to Derry. That where they're going?

917
01:43:37,425 --> 01:43:40,553
不  他们要前往麻州  我们需要阿达的协助
No, they're going towards Massachusetts. We need Duddits.

918
01:43:40,728 --> 01:43:43,754
小琼说外星人很怕阿达
Jonesy says Mr. Gray is afraid of Duddits.

919
01:43:43,931 --> 01:43:47,992
你兄弟和外星人纠缠这么久  还撑的下去吗
Your buddy, he's still alive after all this time with Mr. Gray?

920
01:43:48,169 --> 01:43:51,002
还可以  他有免疫  我想是因为他已经死过一次了
Yeah, he's immune. I think it's because he died.

921
01:43:52,740 --> 01:43:56,904
他被车撞了  心跳停了两次
He got hit by a car and his heart stopped. Twice.

922
01:43:57,078 --> 01:43:58,909
可能连他自己都不知道
I don't think he even knows it.

923
01:43:59,247 --> 01:44:02,774
他死而复生  一定改变了什么
He came back from the dead. Must have changed him somehow.

924
01:44:04,519 --> 01:44:09,047
似乎阿达知道这一切  是不是这样呢
It's almost like Duddits saw this whole thing coming. Is that it?.

925
01:44:11,426 --> 01:44:15,362
小琼告诉我  是阿达让他发生车祸的
Jonesy told me it was Duddits who drew him into the accident.

926
01:44:15,530 --> 01:44:18,158
如果我们抓到他  必须杀了他
If we catch him, we're gonna have to kill him.

927
01:44:18,533 --> 01:44:22,094
你知道我们必须杀他吧  唯有杀了他才能阻止外星人
You know we have to do it. It's the only way to stop Mr. Gray...

928
01:44:22,670 --> 01:44:24,695
但也得先抓着他
...assuming we can catch him.

929
01:44:27,842 --> 01:44:30,208
上一次看到阿达是什么时候
When was the last time you saw Duddits?.

930
01:44:30,378 --> 01:44:32,005
很久了
Long time ago.

931
01:44:33,114 --> 01:44:34,513
好多年了
Years.

932
01:44:35,950 --> 01:44:38,214
你为何那么确定他帮得上忙
What makes you so sure he can help?.

933
01:44:38,786 --> 01:44:40,413
阿达很行的
Duddits can do anything.

934
01:44:41,389 --> 01:44:45,655
我不清楚为什么  但我想他无所不能
I didn't understand that then, but I think it's always been true.

935
01:44:46,394 --> 01:44:48,885
就是他把我们搞成这样子
He's the one who made us like this.

936
01:44:49,063 --> 01:44:51,861
哪样子  你知道  很灵异
Like what? You know, weird.

937
01:45:08,115 --> 01:45:09,707
他等你很久了
He's been waiting for you.

938
01:45:09,884 --> 01:45:11,249
被暴风雪耽误了
Blizzard slowed us up.

939
01:45:11,419 --> 01:45:13,580
亨利…
Henny, Henny.

940
01:45:14,722 --> 01:45:16,189
亨利
Henny.

941
01:45:20,962 --> 01:45:23,157
好想你  亨利
I miss you, Henny.

942
01:45:23,331 --> 01:45:25,299
好想你
I miss you.

943
01:45:27,902 --> 01:45:29,460
亨利
Henny.

944
01:45:29,704 --> 01:45:32,036
好久不见了  亨利
Long time, Henny.

945
01:45:37,245 --> 01:45:41,375
天啊  达太太  他怎么了  得了白血病
My God, Roberta, what is it?. Lymphocytic leukemia.

946
01:45:44,452 --> 01:45:48,912
我会让你把他带走  但我必须告诉你原因
I'm gonna let you take him, but I have to tell you why.

947
01:45:49,957 --> 01:45:52,585
他准备好了  知道你来
Just now, when he was getting ready...

948
01:45:54,462 --> 01:45:57,863
他变得很兴奋
...Henry he was so excited.

949
01:45:58,032 --> 01:46:00,933
他已经很久没这样了
Like he hasn't been in such a long time.

950
01:46:07,975 --> 01:46:09,738
我想
I think...

951
01:46:09,911 --> 01:46:13,472
他若和你一起  也许可以快乐些离开
...that if he's with you, he might die happy...

952
01:46:13,948 --> 01:46:16,280
而不必孤单地死在这里
...instead of in this awful room.

953
01:46:18,753 --> 01:46:22,245
记的帮他把外套扣紧  他耐不住寒冷的
Be sure the parka stays on tight. Cold devastates him.

954
01:46:23,257 --> 01:46:26,420
药物及服用方法都在这
The medication and instructions are in here.

955
01:46:27,795 --> 01:46:29,319
再见  妈
Bye, Mom.

956
01:46:42,610 --> 01:46:45,773
再见  阿达  要乖乖的
Goodbye, Duddie. Be a good boy.

957
01:46:47,915 --> 01:46:50,247
去拯救世界吧
Now, go save the world.

958
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:20,907
不用担心  阿兵哥
I'm all right, laddie.

959
01:47:21,115 --> 01:47:24,812
他们还没那个胆抢走我的地盘  没那个胆
They haven't got enough courage to take my trailer. Not yet, anyway.

960
01:47:24,986 --> 01:47:26,214
情况如何
What've we got?

961
01:47:26,387 --> 01:47:31,518
他们正离开戴瑞市  从95号公路南行  前往麻州
They're leaving Derry, Maine, heading south on 95. Toward Massachusetts.

962
01:47:31,692 --> 01:47:33,319
麻州
Massachusetts?

963
01:47:35,229 --> 01:47:36,958
继续追踪
Stay with it, bucko.

964
01:47:49,543 --> 01:47:51,704
麦迪森将军  请进
General Matheson. Come in, please.

965
01:47:55,316 --> 01:47:56,840
太好了  亚伯
This is very nice, Abe.

966
01:47:57,018 --> 01:47:59,486
历经艰难终于回来了
Been home through some rough times.

967
01:47:59,720 --> 01:48:02,154
我们还有什么没讨论的
Was there something we hadn't covered?

968
01:48:02,556 --> 01:48:06,424
我想我不用跟你说   我非常佩服你之前的成就
I don't think I got to say before how much I respect the work you've done.

969
01:48:06,594 --> 01:48:08,459
我真的好后侮
It was with sincere regret--

970
01:48:08,629 --> 01:48:10,824
郝曼  可以这样叫你吗
Herman-- May I call you Herman?.

971
01:48:11,465 --> 01:48:15,799
策略上  我们无法达成共识  但我们都同意这样解决
We may not agree on all the strategic initiatives, but we do agree on this:

972
01:48:15,970 --> 01:48:20,634
我老了  没力气了  是该退休了  就这样
I'm past it. Burned out. Just needed a push, that's all.

973
01:48:20,941 --> 01:48:23,739
蒙他拿那次灾难后  就该退休了
Should have quit after that mess in Montana.

974
01:48:26,113 --> 01:48:28,673
我甚至无法相信自己的判断力
Even I don't trust my judgment anymore.

975
01:48:30,251 --> 01:48:31,684
所以
Oh, yeah....

976
01:48:31,852 --> 01:48:35,811
我的技术人员告诉我  这里仍有电子通讯设备在使用
My techies tell me we're getting some electronics reading hot from in here.

977
01:48:36,157 --> 01:48:39,388
是的  我一直在用卫星电话  和我太太连络
Yes, I've been talking to the wife on my sat phone.

978
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:43,724
不知道你有没有见过芭芭拉  她一直希望我退休
I don't know if you've ever met Barbara. She's been after me for years to retire.

979
01:48:43,898 --> 01:48:48,426
我敢说她现在一定乐透了  一小时内将会关闭所有器材
She's very happy, I can tell you that. I'll have everything shut down in an hour.

980
01:48:48,636 --> 01:48:51,469
这样可以吗
If that's soon enough.

981
01:48:52,039 --> 01:48:53,734
没问题的
That will be fine.

982
01:49:41,689 --> 01:49:43,816
怎么关掉这烂灯
How do you turn off the goddamn lights?

983
01:49:43,991 --> 01:49:47,358
或许你不该那么快  就干掉那些警察
Maybe you shouldn't have been so fast to kill that trooper.

984
01:49:47,528 --> 01:49:49,155
把地球当成自己家了
You're making yourself at home.

985
01:49:49,330 --> 01:49:52,959
你懂个屁  告诉我  喜不喜欢这声音
You have no idea, Jonesy. Tell me how you like this:

986
01:49:53,134 --> 01:49:57,798
"或许你不该那么快"  "就干掉那些警察"  不赖吧
"Maybe you shouldn't have been so fast to kill that trooper." Not bad?

987
01:49:59,106 --> 01:50:00,767
不喜欢啊  外星人
Oh, don't like that, Gary, do you?

988
01:50:02,009 --> 01:50:05,604
小琼  他在警车里面
Ownzy. He's in a police car now.

989
01:50:06,680 --> 01:50:08,341
他在警车里
He's in a police car now.

990
01:50:08,516 --> 01:50:10,313
可以看到他们在哪吗
Can you see where they are, Duds?

991
01:50:12,019 --> 01:50:15,182
小琼   "坏心" 人在他身体里
Ownzy. He's in lster Gay.

992
01:50:16,757 --> 01:50:18,247
"坏心"人
Mr. Gray.

993
01:50:18,793 --> 01:50:20,988
没错  阿达 "坏心" 人在他身体里
That's right, Duds, he is in Mr. Gray.

994
01:50:21,162 --> 01:50:23,255
"坏心"人   就是"外星"人
"lster Gay"  is Mr. Gray.

995
01:50:23,597 --> 01:50:24,996
我们得救这女孩
We gotta save this girl.

996
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,467
救 "地球"
Save the world?

997
01:50:27,635 --> 01:50:31,162
不是"地球"  是女孩  以后再去拯救地球
Not the world, Duds, a girl. We'll save the world some other time.

998
01:50:31,338 --> 01:50:32,396
"坏心"人
Ister Gay?

999
01:50:36,043 --> 01:50:37,874
你早就知道了
You already knew.

1000
01:50:40,147 --> 01:50:41,978
他要去哪里  阿达
Where's he going, Duds?

1001
01:50:42,783 --> 01:50:45,684
外星人要把小琼带到哪
Where is Mr. Gray taking Jonesy?

1002
01:51:01,902 --> 01:51:04,530
"坏心"人要 "睡"
Ister Gay, he want war.

1003
01:51:04,738 --> 01:51:07,229
睡觉  不是睡觉  是水
War?  Not war, water.

1004
01:51:08,309 --> 01:51:09,970
外星人要水
Mr. Gray wants water.

1005
01:51:10,644 --> 01:51:11,906
我知道他要去哪儿
I know where he's going.

1006
01:51:12,079 --> 01:51:14,843
他要去奎宾蓄水厂  什么奎宾蓄水厂
He's going to the Quabbin Reservoir. What's Quabbin?

1007
01:51:15,015 --> 01:51:17,609
它提供全波士顿的饮用水
It supplies drinking water for all of Boston.

1008
01:51:19,653 --> 01:51:20,984
什么
What?

1009
01:51:22,857 --> 01:51:25,519
一条虫毁世界
One worm kills the world.

1010
01:51:26,193 --> 01:51:28,661
一条虫毁世界
One worm kills the world?.

1011
01:51:29,930 --> 01:51:33,058
天啊   一条虫
Oh, my God. One worm.

1012
01:51:33,267 --> 01:51:36,703
回到小木屋时  看一堆虫破卵而出
Back at our cabin, I saw the worms that come out of these weasels.

1013
01:51:36,871 --> 01:51:39,965
外星人一定是  要把虫子弄到水里
Mr. Gray must want to get one into the Boston drinking supply.

1014
01:51:42,843 --> 01:51:45,869
一条小虫能使全世界受感染
Just one worm infects the whole world?

1015
01:51:47,915 --> 01:51:49,405
这样走没错吗  是的
Are we going right?. Yes.

1016
01:51:49,583 --> 01:51:54,213
走495号往麻斯公路  干的好  伙伴
Take the 495 to the Mass Pike. It's not far. You're doing great, buddy.

1017
01:51:54,421 --> 01:51:58,414
准备更困难的挑战吗  交给你一样任务
Now, are you ready to try something hard?. I want to ask you something hard.

1018
01:51:58,592 --> 01:52:00,150
好啊  亨利
Yes, Henny.

1019
01:52:00,327 --> 01:52:04,821
太好了  你能和小琼说话吗
Good. Can you talk to Jonesy?

1020
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:07,533
有办法让他感应到你吗
Can you make him hear you?

1021
01:52:08,269 --> 01:52:09,930
小琼
Ownzy...

1022
01:52:11,805 --> 01:52:14,330
还有 "坏心"人
...and lster Gay.

1023
01:52:15,676 --> 01:52:16,802
阿达
Duddits.

1024
01:52:27,154 --> 01:52:31,318
我就知道  他一直都在这里
I knew it. I knew it. He's been here all along.

1025
01:52:31,492 --> 01:52:32,789
等待机会
Waiting.

1026
01:52:33,494 --> 01:52:37,760
小琼  看来我们不是偶遇
Jonesy?. It appears we didn't meet by accident.

1027
01:52:39,166 --> 01:52:42,624
我们都亏欠朋友  阿达
We owe it to our friend, Duddits.

1028
01:52:42,870 --> 01:52:46,670
我不懂你说什么  不懂  不是吧
I don't know what you mean. No? Maybe not.

1029
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:50,332
或许你那精明的朋友  不想让你知道他的来历
Maybe your clever friend didn't want you to know what he was up to.

1030
01:52:50,511 --> 01:52:55,505
那就是为什么  你的记忆库里  没有我的资料
That's why you had nothing in the warehouse about me.

1031
01:52:56,850 --> 01:53:00,308
阿达并不想告诉你  他想为你做什么
Duddits didn't bother to tell you what job he had in mind for you.

1032
01:53:02,022 --> 01:53:03,614
这都不重要
It doesn't matter.

1033
01:53:05,626 --> 01:53:09,460
他的计谋失败了  不是吗  狗狗不
His little scheme didn't work. Did it, lke? No, no.

1034
01:53:09,630 --> 01:53:10,961
我们快到了
We're almost there.

1035
01:53:12,766 --> 01:53:15,098
记忆库中有什么诗词可用的
What was it your poetry file had to say?

1036
01:53:15,803 --> 01:53:19,364
"沉睡前  还有誓言要承诺"  "路途依旧遥远"
I have promises to keep And miles to go before I sleep

1037
01:53:22,776 --> 01:53:27,042
"沉睡前  路途依旧遥远"
And miles to go before I sleep

1038
01:53:48,502 --> 01:53:50,333
阻止那辆直升机
Stop that chopper!

1039
01:54:19,733 --> 01:54:21,598
加速  老兄  别那么龟毛
Punch it, dude. Don 't be a pussy.

1040
01:54:24,638 --> 01:54:26,105
谢谢提醒  外星小琼
Thank you, Gary Jones.

1041
01:54:44,691 --> 01:54:46,625
到水池上方
Go up around the reservoir.

1042
01:54:47,194 --> 01:54:49,662
波士顿的导管从12区开始
Aqueduct to Boston starts in Shaft 12.

1043
01:55:13,320 --> 01:55:15,515
耐心点  小子
Patience, bambino.

1044
01:55:15,689 --> 01:55:17,919
就在前头
Just up ahead.

1045
01:56:47,247 --> 01:56:50,478
留在这照顾你的朋友
Stay here and take care of your friend.

1046
01:56:51,151 --> 01:56:53,449
不管听到什么都别离开
No matter what you hear.

1047
01:57:10,037 --> 01:57:11,470
再见了  医生
So long, doctor.

1048
01:57:25,552 --> 01:57:27,747
乖狗狗  要听话
Good doggy.

1049
01:57:27,921 --> 01:57:29,582
好女孩
Good girl.

1050
01:59:26,206 --> 01:59:27,571
妈的
Shit!

1051
01:59:28,175 --> 01:59:29,836
你这个王八蛋
You son of a bitch!

1052
01:59:50,364 --> 01:59:52,025
等等
Wait.

1053
01:59:52,299 --> 01:59:53,630
等等
Wait.

1054
02:00:25,832 --> 02:00:27,891
回到车里  阿达
Go back to car, Duddie.

1055
02:00:28,068 --> 02:00:29,763
那里比较安全
You'll be safer there.

1056
02:01:14,815 --> 02:01:16,180
小心  小琼
Look out, Jonesy.

1057
02:01:43,109 --> 02:01:45,600
我就知道你会来
I knew you'd come, Henry.

1058
02:01:46,480 --> 02:01:48,345
你不会让我死的
I knew you wouldn't let me die.

1059
02:01:48,849 --> 02:01:51,477
你到底是谁
Who the fuck are you?

1060
02:01:55,355 --> 02:01:58,518
你不认识我吗  不认识
Don't you know me, H?I don't know.

1061
02:02:00,927 --> 02:02:03,794
我必须杀了你
I think I'm gonna have to shoot you.

1062
02:02:03,964 --> 02:02:05,261
才能确定是不是你
Just to be sure.

1063
02:02:08,869 --> 02:02:11,497
你说得对  老兄
Well, maybe you're right, my friend.

1064
02:02:12,339 --> 02:02:15,604
我自己也不确定  是否外星人还在体内
I don't know myself if Mr. Gray is gone.

1065
02:02:16,610 --> 02:02:19,579
他有可能还藏在里面
He could be hiding in here somewhere...

1066
02:02:20,647 --> 02:02:22,581
等待良机

1067
02:02:38,431 --> 02:02:41,264
说些他不知道的事

讲些只有我们才知道的事
Tell me something only we would know.

1070
02:02:58,518 --> 02:03:00,213
这不够
Not good enough.

1071
02:03:04,157 --> 02:03:07,718
你问我吧  随便你问
Well, you decide. Ask me anything.

1072
02:03:24,844 --> 02:03:28,905
在崔氏企业那里  我们认识阿达的那天
At Tracker Brothers, day we met Duddits...

1073
02:03:30,617 --> 02:03:33,177
墙上写了什么字
...what was painted on the wall by the window?.

1074
02:03:46,466 --> 02:03:47,763
"不…"
No...

1075
02:03:51,204 --> 02:03:52,466

02:04:02,582 --> 02:04:04,015
"就没乐趣"
No play.

1077
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:09,317
哈罗
Hello...

1078
02:04:09,823 --> 02:04:11,154

02:04:47,093 --> 02:04:48,355
你
You.

1080
02:04:48,662 --> 02:04:51,324
"史酷比狗狗"

1081
02:04:52,198 --> 02:04:54,530
"我们要干活了"
...we got some work to do now.

1082
02:05:07,881 --> 02:05:10,179
"坏心"人
Ister Gay...

1083
02:05:10,817 --> 02:05:12,580
走开
...go away.

1084
02:05:50,423 --> 02:05:52,482
不要

小琼
Jonesy.

1088
02:08:06,392 --> 02:08:10,226
如果琼斯是你的真名
Jonesy, if that really is your name....

1089
02:08:16,469 --> 02:08:18,994
那你就输我50元  胡扯
That'll be 50 small. Bullshit.

1090
02:08:21,641 --> 02:08:23,973
我是阿达  我是阿达
I Duddits. I Duddits.

1091
02:08:24,143 --> 02:08:26,509
他们都是我朋友  是我最要好的朋友
They're my friends. We're all best friends.
