1
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,910
<i>Do you know who Tyler is? </i>

2
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,400
<i>Yeah. He's a</i> da waar <i>director. </i>

3
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,010
What's a <i>da waar? </i>

4
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,350
A big shot.

5
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,180
Did you know he's in China?

6
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,320
Yeah. He's remaking <i>The Last Emperor. </i>

7
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,890
Don't be nervous.

8
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,330
You're not auditioning for a part.

9
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,930
What's your name?

10
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,190
Yo Yo.

11
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,030
I used to be a cameraman,
but I got <i>shaganged. </i>

12
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,570
What does <i>"shagang"</i> mean?

13
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,140
Means I have lots of free time.

14
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:23,020
As fast as you can, load the film
and start shooting.

15
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,210
You sure are pretty.

16
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,500
Thanks.

17
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,670
Who are you?

18
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,940
You may call me Lucy.
I'm Tyler's assistant.

19
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,610
What's the job?

20
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,520
To shoot a "making of" documentary.

21
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,520
This is an important film...

22
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,820
...about one of the world's
greatest directors.

23
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,260
Why not hire an American?

24
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,990
Why not cut the 20 questions?
Do you speak English?

25
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,360
No.

26
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,570
Good. You won't need it.

27
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,840
Look over this contract.

28
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,810
We'll notify you tomorrow.

29
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,580
- You pay me how much "mar-nee"?
- Not "mar-nee." It's "money."

30
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,980
- Then what's "mar-nee"?
- Money.

31
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,320
My pronunciation sucks
but you understand?

32
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,060
<i>You will shoot everything. </i>

33
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,220
<i>Wherever he goes, you go. </i>
<i>It's 24</i>-<i>7.</i>

34
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:51,400
<i>Mind your own business</i>
<i>and no talking to the press. </i>

35
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:56,840
<i>You are just a pair of eyeballs</i>
<i>recording events. </i>

36
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,540
<i>You have no copyright, </i>
<i>no final cut... </i>

37
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,280
<i>... and no creative control. </i>

38
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,780
<i>The last thing we need is</i>
<i>your creativity. </i>

39
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,490
- <i>Do I have the right to quit? </i>
- <i>Only if we say so. </i>

40
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,500
Months Later

41
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,920
It's a boy!

42
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,690
Cut!

43
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,630
A perfect little baby.

44
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,910
You want to do it again, Mr. Tyler?

45
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,550
Shall we do another take?

46
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,750
Yeah.

47
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,560
Back to one, everyone.
Let's do it again.

48
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,420
Stand by.

49
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,320
Action!

50
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,820
Cut.

51
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,960
- Problem?
- No, no, no. Towel.

52
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,600
No, it's not you. You're...

53
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,330
You're very, very, very good.

54
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,570
- Are you sure?
- Oh, I'm sure. It's me.

55
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,410
It's my problem. You take a break.

56
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,160
Attention!

57
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,830
Everybody sit down!

58
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,530
I think this is the key.

59
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,470
Chinese Imperial Palace,
two colors: red and gold.

60
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,740
Red walls, gold roofs.

61
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,410
Red stands for blood,
the gold for money.

62
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,950
Blood and money.
Asian conception of power.

63
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,590
Who could flaunt power like this?

64
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,050
Only the emperor dared do it.

65
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,520
When Bertolucci made his film
about the emperor...

66
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:42,390
...he empathized with him,
treated him like an ordinary person.

67
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,930
Showed his life
from when he was a kid...

68
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:49,540
...and assumed the throne as if
it were a tragedy. Which is true.

69
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,370
But he did it because that would
appeal to Western audiences...

70
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:58,480
...and guarantee the film's success.
You know, make money.

71
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,810
I don't think
that's the right point of view.

72
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:06,650
The problem is, you have
to break down modern prejudices...

73
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,380
...modern preconceptions.
I mean, God...

74
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,760
I'm Chinese and I thought
Bertolucci's portrayal was moving.

75
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,490
You're not Chinese.

76
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:19,060
You got a Chinese face,
but you were brought up American.

77
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:22,500
You want to know what a Chinese
thinks of an emperor...

78
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,110
...ask Yo Yo what's his opinion.

79
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:30,640
Yo Yo, do you think the emperor
was a tragic figure?

80
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,510
No. He had all
these beautiful babes.

81
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,410
A different one every night,
all state-subsidized.

82
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,680
I've only had one, who divorced me.

83
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,950
I'm a tragic figure.
Tell him exactly what I said.

84
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,850
He had lots of beautiful women.

85
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:48,690
- The emperor.
- Yes. All paid for by the government.

86
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:52,890
His wife divorced him,
so he thinks his life is a tragedy.

87
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,300
That's it. That's what
it's like to live with it.

88
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,070
That's what ordinary Chinese people
think of an emperor.

89
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,300
Good. Very good!

90
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,380
No money, no woman.
That's a tragedy.

91
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,480
Tragedy, tragedy.
I just love you, kiddo.

92
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,680
I also "I love you" too!

93
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,570
<i>He'll be like this today</i>
<i>and tomorrow. </i>

94
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,010
<i>No one knows what he's thinking</i>
<i>or what we're waiting for. </i>

95
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,940
Trust Tyler.
He's the best director in the biz.

96
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,680
He needs a thousand extras
in the most expensive location...

97
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,680
...for his creative process?

98
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,840
This place opens to the public soon.

99
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:51,430
As his assistant, it's your job
to tell him to shoot something.

100
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,530
Peter, don't forget why
you survive in Hollywood...

101
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,600
...is not because you have talent.

102
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,600
It's only because you work
for someone who does.

103
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,700
Stand up!

104
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,880
Do you want them to get changed?

105
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,110
- They're waiting for you.
- Jesus.

106
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:24,160
Everything I'm doing is just...
It's a load of junk.

107
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,300
It's got no inspiration, Lucy.
No vision. Complete waste of time.

108
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,530
Tell Peter it's a wrap.
I can't shoot any more of this crap.

109
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,640
Tony gets here tomorrow.
You should have something to show him.

110
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,640
Yo Yo. Tell Peter, everybody, finished.

111
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:49,010
- Finished. Peter.
- Finished! Finished.

112
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:53,210
- What are you doing?
- Following orders. What are you doing?

113
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,260
Trying to finish this movie,
not stroke his ego!

114
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:02,450
What? If the director isn't ready,
the film will be crap.

115
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,160
- Shut up!
- Hey, what's going on?

116
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,730
He said he's not paid to do
what you just asked.

117
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,230
He said what?

118
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,730
You...

119
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,840
Here... Not clear...

120
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,570
No good, movie also no good.

121
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,790
Money. You're wasting your time.

122
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,590
Clear as a bell.

123
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:41,460
Yo Yo says that without the right idea
at the heart of your movie...

124
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,840
...shooting it is just the same
as taking a piss in the ocean.

125
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,570
Peter, it's a wrap!

126
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,870
- I love you.
- I love you, I love you, I love you.

127
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,680
- It's a wrap!
- I speak Chinese!

128
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,660
Shit, another day wasted. Damn it!

129
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,080
- Hey, kid, how are you?
- How was the trip?

130
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,420
Very long. My ankles are killing me.

131
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,420
It's a great set. Great, great, great.

132
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,930
Peter, my boy. You let me down, kid.
You let me down.

133
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:48,100
You probably think I came here
with a contract...

134
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,630
...but I got you
a one-way ticket back.

135
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,540
Don't beg. I do not like begging.

136
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,140
Well, can I get you a diuretic?

137
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,400
- For what?
- Your ankles.

138
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,740
As long as it's not Chinese herbs.

139
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,580
- Where's Tyler?
- I'll see what I can do.

140
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,580
- This way.
- Thanks, kid. Tyler!

141
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:07,460
We've seen all the dailies
and we're very, very satisfied.

142
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,480
We've seen all the dailies
and we're very, very satisfied.

143
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,930
This could be
a fabulous picture, Tyler.

144
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,890
But there's a problem:

145
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,660
You're over budget, behind schedule
and the investors are getting crazy.

146
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,830
Out of respect for you,
I can hold them off a day.

147
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,410
But you gotta make a choice.

148
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:31,740
I have to make a choice?
I choose to scrap the film. Listen.

149
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:35,680
- Just shut up for a second and listen.
- I'm listening.

150
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:40,850
I could shoot and bring it in
on budget, but you'd end up with junk.

151
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,580
Uninspired trash that
has no truth in it. None!

152
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,230
I've been waiting
for my God of truth...

153
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,590
...but all I get is
the back of his head.

154
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:52,200
He's walking away.
He's left me in the dark.

155
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:56,630
I'm sitting in this black hole
of depression and I can't get out!

156
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,800
- Tyler...
- No! Listen to me!

157
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,170
I've looked from every point of view:

158
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,640
From the Eastern, from the Western,
from a child's, from an artist's.

159
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:09,310
And all I get is a description
of the emperor, you know?

160
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,850
I mean, an...

161
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,220
A superficial representation...

162
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,220
...that doesn't transcend
banal reality.

163
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,420
It doesn't have God's light in it.

164
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:23,890
There's no epiphany.
There's nothing poetically definitive.

165
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:29,770
I realize that none of our films have.
There's nothing I can do about them.

166
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,170
But about this I can,
and that's what I choose to do.

167
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,000
We've known each other how long,
30 years?

168
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,170
You believe me
when I tell you I respect you?

169
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,580
Then for God's sakes,
help me with this.

170
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,310
We've brought in a new kid
to finish the picture.

171
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,350
An MTV kid.
Steven somebody, I forget his name.

172
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,580
He'll take over. He gets no credit.
Your name stays on the picture.

173
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,220
If you agree to these terms,
you get your salary.

174
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,420
You save face, you make money.

175
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,040
You cannot leave my name on it.
I don't care about the new guy.

176
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:07,200
You can't leave my name.
That's the point of me scrapping it.

177
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,310
- I might as well kill myself.
- You got one other choice.

178
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,280
- I'll tell you what it is.
- Yeah?

179
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,280
- Kill me. Go ahead, do it.
- Kill?

180
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,740
Kill me.

181
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,390
There comes a time in the affairs
of men, Yo Yo. Should I kill him?

182
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,490
Should he kill him?

183
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,370
You asked for it.

184
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:41,240
Well, I already made a deal
with Mitsutomo.

185
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,910
The kid will finish the picture.

186
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,570
Your name stays on it.
You have no choice.

187
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,440
The law of karma dictates that...

188
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,310
...for every cause
there must be an effect.

189
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,650
The Buddhist's goal is to transcend
suffering and reach Western paradise.

190
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,760
Lucy.

191
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,450
I need to reload.

192
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,930
What does <i>Jing Jie</i> mean?

193
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,900
I don't know how to translate it.

194
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:47,270
- "The level one can attain."
- Could you be more specific?

195
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,930
- $20 and I'll tell you.
- Why are you treating me this way?

196
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,780
What, are we friends now?
I'm just an employee.

197
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:00,480
- Just a pair of eyeballs, remember?
- Greedy bastard.

198
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,090
Over there.

199
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:20,500
This is you. This is me.
This is Tyler and this is Buddha.

200
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,200
You can see this far.
I can see this far.

201
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,210
Tyler can see this far.

202
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:30,250
And Buddha can see for eternity.

203
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,580
That's <i>Jing Jie. </i>

204
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,850
Buddha is the highest, then Tyler,
then me, then you.

205
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:44,800
Like the saying, "A rat can't see past
her nose." Consider that a freebie.

206
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,140
I'll give you a freebie too.
Go to hell.

207
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:52,470
- What's that mean?
- Go to hell!

208
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,480
Buddha says, "The death of the body
isn't the end of life.

209
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:04,180
It's the beginning of a new life."
Ask Yo Yo if he believes that.

210
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:09,380
Reincarnation certainly makes the idea
of death a lot more inviting.

211
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,360
Do you believe in reincarnation?

212
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,790
Nope. It's all a big hoax.
After you die, that's all she wrote.

213
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,160
He's depressed.

214
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,270
Can't you say something more cheerful?

215
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:27,000
We Chinese have a saying.

216
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:31,480
"If this life is bad, it doesn't matter.
The next life will be better."

217
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,840
We Chinese have a saying: "If this
life is bad, it doesn't matter.

218
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:39,250
There's another life waiting."
So death is not so bad.

219
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:43,190
Woody Allen said he'll take a change
of underwear, just in case.

220
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,950
The Chinese are very good
at comforting themselves.

221
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,490
Chinese... 70 years...

222
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,400
Older people die.

223
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,570
Good finish.

224
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:02,610
Everybody drinks. Cheers.

225
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,510
Good life. To a good life.
To a good life.

226
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,280
A happy funeral.
How do you say "funeral"?

227
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,510
Pay up.

228
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,020
What are you trying to say?

229
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,430
If a person dies after 70,
it's a "happy death."

230
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,900
- He's trying to say...
- No, I get it.

231
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,540
I think I get it.
What he's saying is:

232
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,580
If you go to an older person's
funeral in China...

233
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,370
...when you come out of it,
you feel uplifted and happy.

234
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:45,040
It's the same feeling you get
when you see a really witty comedy.

235
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,210
- A comedy. A really funny comedy.
- Very comedy.

236
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,620
- <i>Xiju</i>?
- Yes.

237
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,160
- <i>Xiju</i> is...
- Comedy.

238
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:55,060
- Comedy.
- What is the word for "funeral"?

239
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,390
- "Funeral."
- Comedy funeral.

240
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,230
Comedy funeral.

241
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,960
Comedy funeral!

242
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,540
Comedy funeral?

243
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,010
Comedy funeral?

244
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,330
Tyler, I don't know
how to tell you this.

245
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:36,130
The Japanese had a meeting with
the crew and didn't inform us.

246
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,260
They told everyone
because of your health...

247
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,240
...you had to return
to the States for rest...

248
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,000
...and Steven will take over
as director.

249
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:49,620
After the meeting, they told Peter
in private that he was fired.

250
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:55,750
The Japanese brought over their own
producer. Yo Yo was fired too.

251
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,730
- Tony wants you in the makeup truck.
- Okay.

252
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:06,660
Before he leaves, I need
to clear up some things with him.

253
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,700
It's only going to be a little break.

254
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,280
I need the rest anyhow.
It's not going to be long.

255
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,350
Give my love to Lilian.

256
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:27,380
Tell the kids I'm sorry I don't
have gifts. It came on so quick.

257
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,450
I understand your situation.

258
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,760
Take care of yourself.

259
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,430
Yo Yo.

260
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,700
Camera.

261
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,110
Yes.

262
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,470
Change.

263
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,290
How long?

264
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,860
- Four...
- Four minutes.

265
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,690
You...

266
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,060
...sit. Sit.

267
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,800
I shoot you.

268
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,900
Sit.

269
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:58,040
This way. Good.

270
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,050
Four minutes.

271
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,590
My gift to you.

272
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,220
You have a God-given talent.
And you just...

273
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:23,930
All he needs is the right opportunity.

274
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:27,730
My work finish? My English no good.

275
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,840
So you say yes or no?

276
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:35,040
Yeah. My work finish too.

277
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,120
I'm going to get on my horse.

278
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:44,380
What time come China?

279
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:47,620
Work for you. Free.

280
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,760
I want you to give me comedy funeral.

281
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:58,130
Comedy funeral! No problem!
I'm waiting for your news.

282
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,500
My God, the truth is standing around.
It's a woman!

283
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:06,240
Got really short hair.
She's trying to tell me everything.

284
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,150
Hey, what's wrong? Are you okay?

285
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,580
Hello? Hello? Somebody help!

286
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,190
Lucy! Lucy!

287
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,590
Lucy!

288
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,220
Somebody help!

289
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,300
Lucy, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

290
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,460
- How long you been here?
- About two hours.

291
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,070
My English not good.

292
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,800
I can't believe it.
Maybe it's my fault.

293
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,010
I came here to help.
Now look what's happened.

294
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:48,450
All right, thank you. Go home.

295
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,780
No. This is not your business.

296
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,090
My bag.

297
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,820
I said get out of here!

298
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,970
We had a misunderstanding.
I hope I didn't hurt you.

299
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:46,200
I just wanted my bag and helmet.

300
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,930
Tony's having
a private meeting, and...

301
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,970
Hey, man. Thanks.

302
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:54,370
You're a good guy.
We could become friends.

303
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,310
Be cool!

304
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,210
Sorry, baby.

305
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:02,790
It's like he expected this.

306
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,650
These last few days,
all he and Yo Yo...

307
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:10,230
...that Chinese guy who was here,
have been talking about is funerals.

308
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,820
He kept saying
he wanted a comedy funeral.

309
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,600
I thought his spirits were low
and he was joking.

310
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,710
But just before he passed out...

311
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:25,110
...he told me he wanted Yo Yo
to give him a comedy funeral.

312
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:30,250
I don't know. But if he dies,
does that count as his will?

313
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,720
It sounds like he authorized it.

314
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:37,520
Does he think Yo Yo can
organize his funeral?

315
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:40,220
He's controlling
how he'll be remembered.

316
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:44,690
He's proving that he's asking face
from nobody, giving face to nobody.

317
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:49,200
He's confused. He thinks we
deserted him, so he's deserting us.

318
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,130
He's got huge pride.

319
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,340
Poor Tyler.

320
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:59,210
For the sake of friendship,
you should handle the funeral.

321
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,140
Quiet.

322
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,680
<i>Comedy funeral. </i>

323
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:08,250
<i>Comedy funeral! </i>
<i>A comedy funeral, no problem! </i>

324
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:12,720
<i>She's going to tell me everything. </i>

325
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:14,420
<i>Help! </i>

326
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,320
<i>Lucy! Lucy! </i>

327
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,230
<i>Oh, my God! Tyler! Please! No! </i>

328
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,270
<i>Yo Yo, give me comedy funeral. </i>

329
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:29,100
<i>No! Oh, my God, Tyler! No, please! </i>

330
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:32,580
<i>Yo Yo, get an ambulance! </i>

331
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,550
Is this his will?

332
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,780
I think he's had a nervous breakdown.

333
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:43,510
It's an authorization.
You're responsible for his funeral.

334
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:52,200
- What did that idiot say to you?
- This idiot says he's gonna do it.

335
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,800
Moronic.

336
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,630
Sorry I can't be with you.
I gotta go to Japan for a few days.

337
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,810
Excuse me. Hello?

338
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:05,500
Hey, Mike, how are you? I'm in China.
I'm on my way to the airport.

339
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,310
Well, a little problem has come up.

340
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,720
<i>Princess Diana's casket... </i>

341
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:19,920
<i>... is adorned by flowers</i>
<i>from her sons... </i>

342
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:23,260
<i>... and a handwritten card... </i>

343
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,520
<i>... from her mother. </i>

344
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,470
<i>Thousand of mourners</i>
<i>line the route... </i>

345
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,870
Over here!

346
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,390
Out drinking again?

347
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:58,600
Yellow hair doesn't suit you.

348
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,270
- You should dye it back.
- Why?

349
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,730
You look inbred.

350
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:09,080
You disappear for five years!
Now there's some big mystery!

351
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,980
I'll tell you. But only if
you promise to keep it a secret.

352
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:18,850
Just because I drive a Cadillac,
doesn't mean I'm rich.

353
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:22,850
Concerts rely on sponsors.

354
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:26,220
I don't make a cent
off the box office.

355
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:29,090
And no fires...

356
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,430
...or floods this year.

357
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:36,470
So no benefit concerts to profit
from others' suffering.

358
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:41,070
You bonehead! I don't need your money.
I've got a big job for you.

359
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:45,870
I don't have any to give you anyway!
On the way over, I thought:

360
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,370
"If he needs 20,000,
I'll just give him 2000."

361
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:52,280
My treat.

362
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,550
So, what's up?

363
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:00,430
You're a bigtime promoter, right?

364
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:04,900
I'm the best.

365
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,920
How about a funeral?

366
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,070
A funeral?

367
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,640
If we're talking John Doe, forget it.

368
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:17,180
But, say, that Russian sub...

369
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,010
- What's it called?
- The <i>Kursk</i>.

370
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,080
Right, the <i>Kursk. </i>

371
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:25,550
Now that's a show! I'd definitely
be able to pull it off.

372
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,910
Center stage. A huge replica
of the ill-fated sub.

373
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:34,260
Top models strutting back
and forth in sexy navy outfits.

374
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:39,870
We'll get Celine Dion to sing
"My Love Will Go On."

375
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:45,200
Really!
Why didn't I think of this before?

376
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,600
I'm being serious.

377
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,810
- All right. Whose funeral?
- Someone in the arts.

378
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:57,710
Well, that depends.
It's got to be a big shot.

379
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,410
And he can't be an asshole.

380
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:04,080
Or a child molester.
There are limits to what we can do.

381
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:07,390
Akira Kurosawa, for instance.

382
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:11,430
There's a death
you could make some money on.

383
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:14,190
Bigger than Kurosawa.

384
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,300
Who?

385
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,940
Couldn't be Chinese.

386
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,340
- Tyler.
- Which Tyler?

387
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,920
That Tyler!

388
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,080
Oh, that Tyler?

389
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:36,090
Of course, that Tyler.

390
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,650
We're in business.

391
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:47,220
Welcome.

392
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,200
Hi, Lucy. Mitsutomo's producer
Nakati-san is waiting inside.

393
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,030
I'll be working for him.

394
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:56,940
They felt that my experience
was valuable, so they kept me on.

395
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:01,310
I know this may hurt Tyler's feelings,
but I gotta work too.

396
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,240
Tyler might find it surprising,
but not me.

397
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:09,350
Excuse me. How is Tyler?

398
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,520
Is that really important to you?

399
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,590
Let me speak frankly.

400
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,990
If Tyler unfortunately passes away...

401
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,660
...well, that's a great
selling point of the film.

402
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,900
But we need permission to use
his name as the director.

403
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,010
You speak for Mr. Tyler now.

404
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,410
I hope that you will give us
that permission.

405
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,810
Tyler doesn't want his name
on the film.

406
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,480
That's because he is unable to speak.

407
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:41,180
Name a price.
Name a pretty high price.

408
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:45,260
It's worth it to us,
and I know you need the money.

409
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,020
Tyler's going to recover.

410
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,630
I understand your feelings.

411
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:54,890
The doctors said it's a matter of time.
He's going to die.

412
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:59,330
That's true of you as well. You'll die.
It's just a matter of time.

413
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,170
I've heard enough from both of you.

414
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:06,140
Lucy. Lucy, come... Lucy, come back.

415
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:10,110
What happened? I am very upset!

416
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:19,450
Cut that light. No backlight.
Soon as I roll, start pouring.

417
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,530
And make sure it bubbles.

418
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:26,000
<i>Hi, I'm not in, </i>
<i>and I'm not telling where I went. </i>

419
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,600
<i>Leave a message. </i>

420
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,330
<i>Hi, Yo Yo. It's Lucy. </i>

421
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:36,440
<i>I need to rent a car... </i>

422
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,200
<i>... and find a place to stay. </i>

423
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,910
<i>I had no one else to turn to. </i>

424
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:07,800
- I'll do it.
- Stay in the car! Get back in the car!

425
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,090
Cold?

426
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:38,060
I've got a three-point plan.
First, dry clothes.

427
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:42,300
Second, hot soup. Third...

428
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:45,880
- What?
- I'm working on it.

429
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,350
What's your plan after he dies?

430
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:44,770
Go ahead and cry.
You've been holding it back too long.

431
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,940
Thanks.

432
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:00,980
You can sleep with me if you want.
No, that's not what I mean.

433
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:05,220
I mean, hotels aren't cheap.

434
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:10,530
Not that you don't have money,
because I'm sure you do.

435
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:16,030
It's not the money, it's just...
So if you don't care about, you know...

436
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:21,540
If you're not afraid...
What the hell am I talking about?

437
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:27,670
Could you come here and hug me?

438
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:49,900
Forget it. Forget it.
Maybe I should go.

439
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:02,740
- Why go to the hospital now?
- He needs me.

440
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,500
I'll show you a hug!

441
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:36,240
Don't be afraid. It's okay.

442
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:51,060
Don't cry. I'm here for you.

443
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,770
If anything happened to you,
how could I go on?

444
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:03,100
Stop gazing at me like that.

445
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,820
His office is upstairs.

446
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,260
- You play pool?
- A little. Tyler loves it.

447
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:29,930
Snooker's more my style.

448
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,580
Wang, she's here.

449
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:42,240
What the hell?! You said 10!

450
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,440
- Well, just meet her.
- No, no, no!

451
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:46,210
I'll introduce you.

452
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,410
No way!

453
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:51,720
This is an international occasion!
This demands formal attire!

454
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:54,290
Keep her busy.

455
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,290
I'll meet you upstairs!

456
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,390
Let's roll.

457
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,100
Allow me to introduce you.

458
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:11,070
This is...

459
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:14,480
Is it George or Louis this time?

460
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,170
Louis!

461
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,750
Louis Wang.

462
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:21,440
GM of 3W-Dot-Com Productions.

463
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:27,130
This is Tyler's assistant, Lucy.
She'll be supervising the funeral.

464
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:31,360
On behalf of our comrades
at 3W-Dot-Com...

465
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:36,060
...please accept our condolences
over Mr. Tyler's tragic death.

466
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:40,040
- Please allow me...
- Excuse me. Tyler's not dead yet.

467
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:45,370
But he's real close.
And it doesn't look good.

468
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,750
Well, whatever the outcome...

469
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:54,250
...our hearts are heavy with anguish.

470
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:00,550
Go ahead.

471
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,060
It happened so suddenly. We haven't
had enough time to discuss it.

472
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,760
There is no comfortable event...

473
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:18,710
But our company has a credo.

474
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:24,410
We will fight the tough battle.

475
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,550
We will fight the big battle.

476
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:31,520
We will win the battle
that cannot be won!

477
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:35,590
- We will...
- Mr. Wang. How can you do that?

478
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,960
He means there's nothing
they can't do.

479
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:42,000
- I understand Chinese.
- I'm sorry.

480
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:47,040
My company has a policy that
when meeting with a foreign guest...

481
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,900
...each side only speak
their native language.

482
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,770
What? Is that necessary?

483
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:57,040
I would respect your policy...

484
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:00,120
Cut the crap, all right?

485
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:04,480
When did you become so pragmatic,
like a goddamn American?

486
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:06,990
Stick to the point.
Get down to business.

487
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:12,120
Let's get down to business.
First, the location.

488
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:16,460
Because of the time,
this is still just a rough sketch.

489
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:21,230
- But it gives the general idea.
- What's with the U.S. flag?

490
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,610
Duh. Tyler's an American.

491
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:46,430
That's the Temple of the Ancestors.
Tyler filmed there.

492
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:54,060
Let me explain our reasoning.
We eliminated some choices.

493
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:56,900
A funeral home was
out of the question.

494
00:42:57,110 --> 00:43:00,940
Too spooky and didn't follow
Tyler's wishes.

495
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:06,950
We also considered a place
familiar and dear to him:

496
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,880
A sound stage.

497
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:12,680
But that's too small and limiting.

498
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:15,450
And you can't tell it's China.

499
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,830
So after much deliberation...

500
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:22,830
...we chose a venue
of immense cultural importance!

501
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,130
- The Forbidden City.
- Perfect.

502
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,640
Tyler's an American,
but his laolao...

503
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,710
...the mother of his mother,
was Italian.

504
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:36,710
So we kick it off with Zhang Yimou...

505
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:39,210
...directing <i>Turandot. </i>

506
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:43,390
<i>Turandot</i>? What?
The opening's going to take two hours?

507
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:48,720
We won't do the whole thing.
Just a few arias.

508
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:53,720
Like "Nessun Dorma."
What do you think?

509
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:57,370
I prefer "What a Beautiful Jasmine."

510
00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:01,560
It's adapted from a Chinese folk song.

511
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:05,370
So it's Italian, but sounds Chinese.

512
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:09,020
Like Puccini knew Tyler'd die in China.

513
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,580
It's fate.

514
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:13,010
Next we'll have...

515
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:17,020
...a stand-up comedy routine:

516
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,750
"The Joke Is on Tyler."

517
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,360
Like your talk shows,
only more depressing.

518
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:25,590
And then, to get
the emotion flowing...

519
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:31,430
...rock star Zang Tianshuo performs
his chart-topping anthem.

520
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:48,350
<i>Friend, oh, my friend</i>

521
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:52,290
<i>Do you ever think of me? </i>

522
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:55,860
<i>If you've found happiness</i>

523
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:59,860
<i>Then let our memories be</i>

524
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:03,600
<i>Friend, oh, my friend</i>

525
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,840
<i>Do you ever think of me? </i>

526
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:11,440
<i>If you can't stand it</i>

527
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:14,140
<i>Please tell me</i>

528
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:19,010
Next up, director Chen Kaige...

529
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:24,950
...and Tyler's favorite actress,
Gong Li...

530
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:27,920
...will award his corpse...

531
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:32,360
...a Golden Rooster
for lifetime achievement.

532
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:35,930
If Gong Li cancels,
we'll get Zhang Ziyi.

533
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:37,330
He loves her.

534
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:41,200
The last section is
"Tyler's New Life."

535
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:20,470
This kid is Tyler's reincarnation.

536
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:26,120
But Tyler's white.
How'd he become Chinese?

537
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:29,510
If he dies in China...

538
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,190
...he should become Chinese.

539
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:35,830
He should come out
the way he went in.

540
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,330
But that doesn't benefit
Sino-U.S. friendship, does it?

541
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:44,700
It could injure the feelings
of the Chinese people.

542
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:49,640
- We wouldn't want that.
- What about the American people?

543
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,240
All right, let's not argue about it.

544
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:55,140
Look...

545
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,650
...Tyler's memory belongs to the world.

546
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:05,310
Because he's white now, doesn't mean
he should stay white. Let me finish.

547
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:08,720
So although he dies here...

548
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,590
...he doesn't have
to come back Chinese.

549
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,200
Be cool!

550
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,840
He should return to the people...

551
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,300
...who need him most.

552
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:23,240
Now since Africa's film industry is
still in its start-up phase...

553
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,670
...how about an African baby?

554
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,680
- What?
- African?

555
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,320
A little black kid shooting
across the sky! The skin is black.

556
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,220
The kid still has Tyler's voice
and speaks English...

557
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:41,820
...returning from the dead
to tell his fans:

558
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,390
"I love you."

559
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,530
Shit. We have to do it that way.

560
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:54,100
Only three colors to choose from,
unless we turn him into a bird or fish.

561
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:57,640
- Then we have more options.
- Dark black or mocha?

562
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,110
True crimson.

563
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:06,220
Check this out.

564
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,720
Change the color, not the sex!

565
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:22,940
- They're sick.
- It's a virus!

566
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:27,340
- Maybe he'd be happier as a girl.
- Shut up!

567
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:31,900
An Asian footprint isn't enough.
We want global coverage!

568
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:34,510
Do whatever it takes!

569
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:37,110
We'll rent a Russian satellite.

570
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:42,580
You tell him, worldwide TV
gets broadcast rights...

571
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:45,520
...but he pays the satellite fee.

572
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:48,060
With a global broadcast...

573
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:51,030
...we are talking billions of viewers.

574
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:53,220
<i>Turandot</i> will make money.

575
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,160
This thing's really snowballing.
Makes me nervous.

576
00:48:58,370 --> 00:49:00,310
Don't sweat it, I'm here!

577
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:03,440
We have to resolve
the time zone problem.

578
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:10,170
For European viewers,
early morning would be ideal.

579
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,820
Keep them up all night.

580
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:16,150
- The Chinese audience comes first.
- Good point.

581
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,550
Things are taking shape.
Everything's about set.

582
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,490
I hope Tyler holds out
a few more days...

583
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:25,530
...so I can get this stage up.

584
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:29,960
We're bleeding money like crazy.

585
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:34,300
I've been so busy, I forgot to ask:

586
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:38,070
Who's paying for this?
I'm going to need some cash.

587
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:42,110
Tyler should pay. You front cash
to get it rolling, then...

588
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,550
"Should pay"? He has to pay!

589
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,350
Don't worry. I got it covered.

590
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,290
Make sure of it.

591
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,460
Don't worry about this.

592
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:20,050
He's sure got some fight in him.

593
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:24,320
The machines are keeping him alive.
And gives you more time.

594
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,790
How's it going?

595
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:29,760
It's all set.
Come out, we need to talk.

596
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,670
I keep forgetting to ask about
the money. What's your budget?

597
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:40,930
It won't be cheap.

598
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:45,670
We don't have any money.
You'll have to think of something.

599
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:51,180
What do you mean,
I'll have to think of something?

600
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:58,920
Tyler never mentioned money at all?

601
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:01,390
He's totally broke.

602
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,460
Then what the hell am I doing?
He's not my father!

603
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,560
I'm totally screwed!

604
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:14,830
No one's forcing you.

605
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,170
<i>Mr. Zhang is exiting the bathroom! </i>

606
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:28,980
I'll secure the hallway.

607
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:40,630
<i>Mr. Zhang is the Genghis Khan</i>
<i>of Chinese T. </i>

608
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:44,330
His investments are quite aggressive.

609
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,030
A ferocious appetite!

610
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,170
You produce half
of all TV dramas, correct?

611
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:53,000
I heard all about you!
So that's really you?

612
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,870
Sure as hell ain't you.

613
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:56,740
Have a seat.

614
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:04,120
I heard you're doing online casting
for <i>Golden Lotus</i>. Any luck?

615
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:08,160
I'd go with a character actor.

616
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:09,660
Yo Yo.

617
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:13,920
Shut up for a second. Listen to
Mr. Zhang's condition for sponsorship.

618
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:17,530
My terms are simple.

619
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:26,340
Here's what I want to happen.
This mystery woman...

620
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:29,410
...will accompany Tyler...

621
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:32,850
...throughout the funeral.

622
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:37,690
- Who's this?
- Tyler's lover!

623
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:39,350
Impossible!

624
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:43,290
At his age? Are you kidding?

625
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:46,590
Maybe for Clinton's funeral.

626
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,820
What?

627
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:53,200
Of course, it's just an act.
She's an actress.

628
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:57,670
Your <i>Golden Lotus</i>, right?

629
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:01,280
The funeral...

630
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,310
...will launch her career.

631
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:07,320
The media loves that shit!
She'll be famous overnight!

632
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:09,890
Famous before her first role?

633
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:11,580
Exactly!

634
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:13,550
If we agree...

635
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,160
...Mr. Zhang foots the whole bill.

636
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,560
- Five million.
- You said four! The price went up?

637
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:22,260
It always does.

638
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:26,300
At four million,
we only see a silhouette.

639
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:30,970
For five million,
the veil comes off...

640
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:35,240
...and during the ceremony
she gets three big close-ups.

641
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:37,540
Not a bad offer.

642
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:40,080
All right.

643
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:45,120
But only if she cries on him
for at least 30 seconds.

644
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,590
She can cry for 10 minutes
for all I care.

645
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:51,790
Sit down for a second.
I'll even throw in a bonus.

646
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:56,530
Remember how Tyler reincarnates
as a baby?

647
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:59,830
The part about his New Life?

648
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:02,230
For another <i>5</i>00,000...

649
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,840
...I guarantee
the baby recognizes only her!

650
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:09,410
The first word it says will
be her name! Your name?

651
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:11,110
Nina.

652
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:16,320
Nina's better off
as Mr. Zhang's midnight snack.

653
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:21,120
If he's spending money,
we should make him famous.

654
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:24,490
Some plastic surgery,
dye your hair blond...

655
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:27,860
...you can come
as Tyler's bastard son.

656
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:32,660
Mr. Zhang! You don't like that idea?
We can discuss it.

657
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:36,540
But the concept does have
its merits...

658
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:38,040
Why'd you do that?

659
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:42,200
I find an investor
and you pull a stunt like that?

660
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:46,650
His conditions were outrageous.
It would ruin Tyler's reputation.

661
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:50,690
So what?
You know what filmmakers are like!

662
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:54,590
They'll sleep with anybody!
Everyone knows that.

663
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:57,660
If that's too much, then what isn't?

664
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:02,200
Why throw money away at your funeral?
They expect a return!

665
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:07,430
No one's losing money. It's like the
Olympics: a brand-building opportunity!

666
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:13,100
Who wouldn't love to say, "Our company
sponsored Tyler's funeral"?

667
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:18,050
How will you do that?
Hang banners at the funeral?

668
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:24,660
Print logos on the invitation?
Sell airtime? That's your idea?

669
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:29,350
Exactly. If the sponsor's brand is
worthy of Tyler's reputation!

670
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:33,920
If Kodak and Microsoft
give us money, big money...

671
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:37,000
...they can wallpaper the place!

672
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,400
Something like:

673
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:43,010
"Tyler's friends bring you..."

674
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:46,910
Not "Sponsored by,"
but "Lovingly dedicated."

675
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:51,850
"Dedicated" isn't right.
"Lovingly brought." "Lovingly sent."

676
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:54,850
- "Lovingly brought."
- "Lovingly brought."

677
00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:57,250
"Lovingly sent."

678
00:55:57,490 --> 00:56:00,320
And I'm not interested in small fish.

679
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:03,760
Fortune <i>5</i>00 only.

680
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:09,460
- You can't park here.
- I'm leaving.

681
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:13,930
Isn't this disrespectful of Tyler?

682
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,240
No, it's good business.

683
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:27,250
Thanks.

684
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:49,140
Thank you, Father.

685
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:17,670
All right, all right.
All right, sweetheart. Okay.

686
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:19,300
You all right?

687
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:24,310
Well, thank God
we got the old devil back.

688
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:28,000
Yeah, but he won't let me
tell Yo Yo he's recovered.

689
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:32,550
Did you know they're using his funeral
to sell advertising?

690
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:37,280
He doesn't want to stop them.
He likes the whole thing.

691
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:40,690
He said it wasn't what he expected,
but even better.

692
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:43,860
By the sound of it,
it sounds interesting.

693
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:48,830
Almost like a French farce.
Yo Yo and Tyler are both scoundrels.

694
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:53,440
And scoundrels, you never know
which card they're going to play.

695
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,630
I have no idea
how this crazy mess will end up.

696
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:59,040
Only God and Hitchcock know that.

697
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:03,480
We may see two possibilities,
but never the third. That's suspense.

698
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,780
Start from the angel.

699
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:10,320
Five, four, three, two, one.
And you're on.

700
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:12,050
This is Victor Lee...

701
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:16,320
...reporting live from downtown Beijing
with an amazing exclusive.

702
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:20,890
<i>It's 9 a.m. local time</i>
<i>and you must stop what you're doing... </i>

703
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:23,360
<i>... to watch the latest development... </i>

704
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:27,770
<i>... of the incredible story</i>
<i>of Don Tyler's funeral. </i>

705
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:44,280
Ladies and gentleman.
We have just entered a new century...

706
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:48,480
...and Hollywood's most colorful
director, Don Tyler...

707
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:53,030
...has given his Chinese friend
the right to organize in China...

708
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:55,600
...a most remarkable funeral.

709
00:58:55,940 --> 00:59:01,700
At the funeral, advertisers will be
allowed to make product placements.

710
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:06,280
Today, the world's largest advertisers
are here...

711
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:10,710
...to participate in
an auction of those ad spots.

712
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:16,550
Not surprisingly, the competition
will be ferocious...

713
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:20,680
...with prices expected to go sky-high.

714
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,330
Yes, sir!

715
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:24,550
No! Hey, hey, hey.

716
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:27,830
They really are selling you.
Aren't you angry?

717
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:32,600
Tony. Do you think he should be
watching this? We should end this.

718
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:37,070
This is my medicine.
This is the best show I've seen on TV.

719
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:40,010
This is absurd. This is really crazy.

720
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:42,810
This is the theater of the absurd.

721
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:47,110
This kid's wonderful. I knew it then,
but he's brilliant, Yo Yo.

722
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:50,650
Call the network.
We should get paid for this.

723
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:54,590
It's much better than
that <i>Survivor</i> crap at home.

724
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:57,160
...prices high!

725
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:00,220
What'd you just say?

726
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,630
I have no idea. You're up.

727
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:10,270
Now I would like to invite
the organizer of Tyler's funeral...

728
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:15,750
...Mr. Yo Yo, to explain
the rules of the auction.

729
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:24,620
In accordance
with Tyler's last wishes...

730
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:29,160
...the advertising space will
be divided into three areas:

731
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:32,990
On-site signage,
funeral platform placements...

732
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:38,400
...and rotating billboards.

733
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:44,970
We'll start
by auctioning the billboards.

734
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:52,740
I hereby declare the proceedings open!

735
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:56,410
For rotating billboard number one...

736
01:00:56,620 --> 01:01:00,320
...we'll begin at $ 100,000!

737
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:03,460
I have a bidder! $ 100,000.
$200,000. $300,000.

738
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,860
$400,000. $ <i>5</i>00,000. $600,000.
$ 700,000. $800,000. $900,000.

739
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:10,000
One million!
One million, going once!

740
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,500
One million, twice!

741
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:15,370
One million, three times!

742
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:18,270
Sold!

743
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:24,040
Sold.

744
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:36,020
Oh, what shit!

745
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:45,340
This is a beautiful image.
It's like I can smell it.

746
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:48,800
I'd love to get my teeth
into one of those.

747
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,070
Sold!

748
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:04,650
At the organizer's request,
Love Island DVD's bid is disqualified.

749
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:07,290
- Be cool!
- What's going on?

750
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:12,830
- The last bid is voided.
- Wait! Why? I demand an explanation!

751
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:19,070
Your player reads
low-quality DVDs, right?

752
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:22,470
Our Super Error Correction made us
the market leader!

753
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:24,940
Love Island reads DVDs of any quality!

754
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:28,770
I'm sorry. We can't accept your money.

755
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:30,940
Why not?

756
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,340
He's kidding!

757
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:36,390
Super Error Correction is piracy!
Legal DVDs don't have errors!

758
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:42,720
TV networks run our ads. Why not you?
That's unfair competition!

759
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:48,460
Tell it to the TV stations!
Personally, I hope you go bankrupt!

760
01:02:48,670 --> 01:02:52,600
I hereby declare that billboard
three is reserved...

761
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:56,970
...for a public service message!

762
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:04,810
FIGHT VIDEO PIRAC Y

763
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:21,590
Who gave you the right to do that?

764
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:26,200
This happens again,
I'll rip your damn head off!

765
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,300
Hear me?

766
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:35,170
Who do you think you're talking to?

767
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:38,280
Listen up!
I am in charge here, not you!

768
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,880
You'll get your money!

769
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:45,890
But shoot your mouth off again,
it'll be your funeral!

770
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:49,220
Money-grubbing weasel!

771
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:04,170
Is video piracy more unethical
than advertising at funerals?

772
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:07,940
Funeral advertising is profiting
by stealing from oneself.

773
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:11,170
Video pirates profit
by stealing from others.

774
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:15,720
I never expected a bum to know about
protecting intellectual property.

775
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:20,450
You can bet he's got a lot of surprises.
I told you he's a genius.

776
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:25,430
His imagination is boundless and
he has the principles to contain it.

777
01:04:25,630 --> 01:04:28,900
That bastard just cost us
a stack of money.

778
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:34,200
Does that monster think he's an angel?
He booked a one-way ticket to hell.

779
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:35,740
But that's how he is.

780
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:40,210
Mostly, he seems like a devil,
but sometimes he's an angel.

781
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:43,400
Oh, sweetie, you're in love with him.

782
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:46,080
In your dreams.
I'd rather go to hell.

783
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:49,310
Good move, we'll all be there.
Yo Yo for sure.

784
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,920
You wouldn't be caught dead
anywhere else.

785
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,990
Of course.
I don't know anybody in heaven.

786
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:59,820
All my friends are in hell.
And now poor Lucy will be there too.

787
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,990
Go see your sweetheart and give him
Tyler's bank account information.

788
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:09,300
I don't want to see that money
disappear into the wrong account.

789
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:12,380
What I want to know is
what you intend to do.

790
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:16,670
It's still too soon. When it's
settled, I'll let you in on it.

791
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:20,810
But I'm not leaving the kid out to dry.
That I assure you.

792
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:23,180
<i>This is NB T with a special report. </i>

793
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:26,880
<i>Next up, live interviews</i>
<i>on the Tyler funeral. </i>

794
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:30,760
<i>What's your opinion about</i>
<i>selling ads at funerals? </i>

795
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:35,800
- <i>Who cares? It's his business. </i>
- <i>Is it disrespectful of the dead? </i>

796
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:41,340
<i>Giving a person what he asks for</i>
<i>is the highest form of respect. </i>

797
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:44,070
Now you're talking!

798
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:48,200
<i>Do you support this concept? </i>

799
01:05:48,410 --> 01:05:52,480
<i>I've got three words: "One man's</i>
<i>glory, another man's shame. "</i>

800
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:54,710
"One man's glory,
another man's shame."

801
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:58,480
Three words, my ass! That's six!

802
01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:01,060
<i>What do you think</i>
<i>about a comedy funeral? </i>

803
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:02,660
<i>A what? </i>

804
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:04,990
Shee-sahng.

805
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,730
<i>A sauna? </i>

806
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:13,230
Bet he's never even seen a sauna!

807
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:19,570
Congratulations.
You're a big celebrity now.

808
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:21,950
Is Tyler...?

809
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:26,310
The doctor says we can pull
the plug anytime.

810
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,490
But I can't do it.

811
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:31,320
He's still alive. Disappointed?

812
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:35,860
With all the ads I sold,
are you disappointed?

813
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:47,430
- He's back again.
- I thought he just left.

814
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:56,170
It's not a bust to be a woman.

815
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:59,940
What does that mean?

816
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:10,530
How many times have I told you?
How many times?

817
01:07:10,730 --> 01:07:13,430
Is it really that hard?

818
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:19,300
First, "Please restrain your grief."
Then the product slogan.

819
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:23,130
One more time. One, two, three.

820
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:27,210
Please restrain your grief.
It's not a bust to be a woman.

821
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:29,680
It's a breast cream ad.

822
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:35,810
The guests enter under the balloons.

823
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:40,120
Each balloon is sponsored.
Hey, where are my ads?

824
01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:42,290
We're working on it.

825
01:07:42,490 --> 01:07:48,520
A Korean cosmetics company
snatched up the balloon ads.

826
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:52,760
Up! Okay, good!

827
01:07:52,970 --> 01:07:57,700
All the liquor companies wanted in.
Bad News Beer finally won the bid.

828
01:07:57,910 --> 01:08:00,880
"The Official Drink
of Tyler's Funeral."

829
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,210
Watch their sales skyrocket!

830
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,440
Insane!

831
01:08:08,090 --> 01:08:13,050
- This is the funeral platform.
- What's with the furniture?

832
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:18,160
- Louis!
- Coming.

833
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,420
Good thing you're here.

834
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:24,800
Our clients requested a few changes
on the platform.

835
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:30,270
This junk is all
famous-brand Italian furniture.

836
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:35,280
They wanted Tyler resting
peacefully on this lovely bed.

837
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:39,580
Like he's taking a long nap,
not dead.

838
01:08:40,190 --> 01:08:43,450
That's a big placement.
Did they pay?

839
01:08:43,690 --> 01:08:47,220
I was waiting for your approval.

840
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:50,050
- It's a nice chunk of change.
- Close the deal.

841
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:55,060
Later, we can hawk it at Sotheby's
as a "Tyler antique."

842
01:08:55,770 --> 01:08:58,630
What's the news from the drill team?

843
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:01,860
Just called. Awaiting our inspection.

844
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:07,810
A huge blimp will be flying overhead
filming this part.

845
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:13,010
We sold the space to a French airline.

846
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:17,780
And they paid through
the croissant for it.

847
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:21,290
We were pretty rushed.
It's still a little rough.

848
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:23,860
Attention, everyone!

849
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:26,690
Positions!

850
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:28,860
First formation!

851
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:32,630
Add the "TV"!

852
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:36,000
Why do you keep adding more crap?

853
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:38,670
Stand by!

854
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:44,250
I forgot to tell you.
I had a great idea.

855
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:46,850
You know that VJ, David Wu?

856
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:49,750
He's got a great style.

857
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,550
A VJ would really spice things up.

858
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:55,730
David Wu is fine, but just hire him.

859
01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:59,290
Quit trying to turn everything
into a scheme.

860
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:00,490
Continue!

861
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:04,430
Since we have the idea,
let's just make him an offer.

862
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:05,970
Maybe he'll agree.

863
01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:10,370
- What's the next formation?
- Who's in charge here?

864
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:13,740
From now on, we both are.

865
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:16,540
This one's a cigarette ad.

866
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:18,050
Listen up!

867
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:19,840
Ready!

868
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:21,520
Second formation!

869
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:29,280
You're wasting time with cigarettes.
If you get fined, don't blame me.

870
01:10:29,490 --> 01:10:33,860
We only mention the logo.
They may think it's a slot machine ad.

871
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:38,130
You think they're stupid?
They'll just pull the whole lot.

872
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:40,070
Stand by!

873
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:44,670
We can add a banner:

874
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:48,610
"No Smoking At The Funeral.
And That Includes 666!"

875
01:10:48,810 --> 01:10:52,810
Your talent's wasted here.
You should run the Olympics.

876
01:10:53,050 --> 01:10:54,110
What did she say?

877
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:58,620
We're wasting our talent
and should run the Olympics.

878
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:00,590
Is that an insult?

879
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:03,590
That's a compliment, right?

880
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:09,630
You've worked hard to make a profit.
How will you spend the money?

881
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:12,860
Originally, I just wanted
to cover the costs.

882
01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:17,570
If there was anything left over,
I'd pay off Tyler's debts.

883
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:20,470
But the money kept piling up.

884
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:25,710
Of course, I'll take care of Louis.
And you, for your devotion to Tyler.

885
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:29,850
You weren't going
to take some for yourself?

886
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:36,160
First, I'll pay off the funeral
and donate the rest to charity.

887
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:41,660
You always said I just wanted money.
I'm giving it away. How about that?

888
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:44,170
- To who?
- That's my problem.

889
01:11:44,370 --> 01:11:48,200
Perhaps Ethiopian disaster victims,
or the pandas.

890
01:11:48,410 --> 01:11:51,380
Would Tyler give it
to people or animals?

891
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:54,440
- People.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

892
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:09,890
This is absolutely brilliant.
The kid's feeling pure terror.

893
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:13,960
He's up in the air
with no visible means of support.

894
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:16,790
To save himself, he has to fly.

895
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,940
But he has self-doubt
and is unsure if he can.

896
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:24,300
But he will. He must stop thinking
about it or he'll crash.

897
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:27,970
He'll fly, do loop-the-Ioops.
It's sensational.

898
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:32,880
I don't like him being toyed with.
It's time we told him the truth.

899
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:36,080
You're wrong. I'm not toying with him.

900
01:12:36,290 --> 01:12:39,520
But there's an idea here.
A great idea for me.

901
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:42,960
You can't tell him.
Promise me you won't.

902
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:46,890
He could come to the hospital
at any time and bust us.

903
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:51,300
Yeah, you're right.
I should be moved somewhere else.

904
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:02,610
Yo Yo.

905
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:07,080
You got room for one more ad?

906
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:09,980
This hearse was a great idea.

907
01:13:10,290 --> 01:13:12,780
Everyone wants a piece.

908
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:17,520
No can do. A watch company
took the tailgate.

909
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:22,260
It's full up.
Only thing left is the hood.

910
01:13:22,470 --> 01:13:25,900
- Sold out in one afternoon.
- Stick it here.

911
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:28,330
The hood! I want it.

912
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:29,840
For who?

913
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:33,440
Starmaker Music.

914
01:13:33,650 --> 01:13:35,700
The boss is an old buddy.

915
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:39,280
We'll get his top singers for free.

916
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:42,820
They're all huge stars.
Know that TV theme song...

917
01:13:44,690 --> 01:13:47,450
..."Don't Come Back!"?

918
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:51,560
- The one where he sobs?
- It's perfect for us.

919
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,890
Li Nan can sing
from the roof of the truck.

920
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:57,030
Always working an angle.

921
01:13:57,240 --> 01:14:00,600
You're using the funeral
to kiss friends' asses.

922
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:05,300
Even though I already paid
for those singers. And another thing:

923
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:08,950
This hearse isn't going straight
to the venue.

924
01:14:09,150 --> 01:14:11,620
Where's it going? The car wash?

925
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:17,690
Advertisers want it to circle the city
a few times first.

926
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:22,790
Give them more exposure. So Li Nan
can't bitch about too much sun.

927
01:14:22,990 --> 01:14:27,090
Okay, Scrooge.
I'll buy him a big sombrero.

928
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:31,240
If all you care about is money,
get him a brand-name suit.

929
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:34,890
He looks disgraceful
in shorts and a tank top.

930
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:36,330
I beg to differ.

931
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:40,500
He looks like an athlete.
A sports lover.

932
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:45,120
- A picture of health!
- Yeah, healthy for a dead person.

933
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:48,450
Looks like he's taking a power nap.

934
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:52,990
The sportswear sold for twice as much
as the suits. Why not wear them?

935
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:54,920
We've come this far.

936
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:58,580
Might as well squeeze every drop.

937
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:02,730
We're done with Game Reaper
sportswear. What's next?

938
01:15:02,930 --> 01:15:05,130
One Time Thief watch.

939
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:08,330
One Epiphany & Sons gold necklace.

940
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:10,570
One PaceMaker running shoe.

941
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:13,210
- Left or right foot?
- Left.

942
01:15:13,410 --> 01:15:16,850
On the right, one Flying Sole
leather dress shoe.

943
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,880
One pair of Traitor sunglasses.

944
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:24,720
Why are you taking the lens out?

945
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:27,920
This one belongs
to a contact lens company.

946
01:15:28,130 --> 01:15:33,390
- Traditionally, the eyes are closed.
- Contractually, this one stays open.

947
01:15:34,370 --> 01:15:39,030
When he passed on, Tyler still
had much to accomplish.

948
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:42,600
One eye holding out
until the end is symbolic.

949
01:15:42,810 --> 01:15:46,970
One bag of Magic Wake tea.
Where does that go?

950
01:15:57,090 --> 01:16:00,520
Such an important spot.
We should up the fee <i>5</i>0% .

951
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:05,960
Remember to have the TV guys
do close-ups on the tea bag...

952
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:07,600
...and contact lens.

953
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:11,000
- Five seconds each.
- Okay.

954
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:15,000
- What's next?
- Snuff Druff shampoo.

955
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:20,540
Isn't this overkill?

956
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:25,640
Let's hear the ad copy.

957
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:31,650
"One side used Snuff. No dandruff.

958
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:35,160
The other side didn't.
See the difference!"

959
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:38,450
"One side used Snuff. No dandruff.

960
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:42,060
The other side didn't.
See the difference!"

961
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:45,930
We can handle that.

962
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:03,590
One side used Snuff. No dandruff.

963
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:07,920
The other side didn't.
See the difference!

964
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:12,260
I can't see the difference.

965
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:19,390
- See it now?
- Oh, come on!

966
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,970
You're totally hopeless.

967
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:26,870
I got Mr. Biao for you!

968
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:31,340
I just love your movies!
Doing another big holiday picture?

969
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:33,920
Let's not waste Mr. Biao's time.

970
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:38,520
- He's got a TV show later.
- Right. Louis probably explained this.

971
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:41,020
We need you to say one line.

972
01:17:41,230 --> 01:17:44,390
Since you're busy,
we'll just walk through it.

973
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:48,400
If it's just a rehearsal,
I don't actually need to cry.

974
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:51,030
- Of course not.
- Have him cry.

975
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:54,030
- I'm Biao, Beijing Film Studio.
- I'm Lucy.

976
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,330
We need you to cry.

977
01:17:56,540 --> 01:17:59,980
If you do it in character...

978
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:02,350
...we'll know what to expect.

979
01:18:02,550 --> 01:18:05,850
At the real funeral,
you can really let her rip.

980
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:08,540
I'm at the final send-off, right?

981
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:10,690
You'll walk up with me.

982
01:18:10,890 --> 01:18:15,220
We'll be surrounded by big stars.
You come just after Stallone.

983
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:17,130
- Shall we start?
- A moment, please.

984
01:18:17,130 --> 01:18:18,430
- Shall we start?
- A moment, please.

985
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:21,290
Tyler.

986
01:19:23,090 --> 01:19:24,360
Tyler.

987
01:19:29,470 --> 01:19:34,530
We Chinese actors began taking
calcium supplements long ago.

988
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:39,110
But it was too late for you!

989
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:43,070
There wasn't time to share...

990
01:19:43,410 --> 01:19:46,320
...with our fellow artists in America!

991
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:53,750
But we were close!

992
01:19:54,330 --> 01:19:56,290
So damn close!

993
01:19:56,490 --> 01:20:00,990
It's the lack of calcium
that killed you!

994
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:06,930
Truly a great actor.
Cries on command.

995
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:12,700
- Did that work for you?
- Wouldn't cry that much if my dad died.

996
01:20:12,910 --> 01:20:16,040
Wow, he felt more for Tyler
than I did.

997
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:17,680
Bullshit. I paid him.

998
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:27,980
I can't wait any longer.

999
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:30,220
What am I going to do?

1000
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,190
- Which one's Yo Yo?
- What for?

1001
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:38,300
Shut your goddamn trap!
I asked for Yo Yo!

1002
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,660
- What do you want?
- Are you Lucy?

1003
01:20:40,870 --> 01:20:45,900
- I'm Yo Yo. It's nothing to do with her.
- Hell, yes, it does!

1004
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:48,040
Our boss wants to talk to her.

1005
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:50,910
Cut the mafia act.
China doesn't have one!

1006
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,140
If you have business, speak up.

1007
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:56,810
That's enough.
Let's discuss this like gentlemen.

1008
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:59,750
Show him.

1009
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:06,960
- Have you tried this mineral water?
- Le Ha-Ha? Never heard of it.

1010
01:21:07,170 --> 01:21:10,230
- I only know Wah Ha-Ha.
- That's why I'm here.

1011
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:14,530
I want mineral water drinkers
everywhere to know Le Ha-Ha.

1012
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:18,200
I heard this funeral
is packed with big sponsors.

1013
01:21:18,410 --> 01:21:22,280
I want a spot for Le Ha-Ha.
I'll pay you well for it.

1014
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,050
Come here.

1015
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:28,010
See for yourself.

1016
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:32,050
He's already fully sponsored.
There's no space.

1017
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:36,120
We had space on the hearse,
but now everything's taken.

1018
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:41,260
Not my problem. Besides, I don't want
to be mixed up with other ads.

1019
01:21:41,470 --> 01:21:47,300
You create an idea to set Le Ha-Ha apart.
Something innovative.

1020
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:50,960
Give me a good concept.
You can name your price.

1021
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:53,640
If not, you can cancel the funeral.

1022
01:21:53,850 --> 01:21:58,180
Thank you very much! Truth is,
I hope it does get called off.

1023
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:02,110
If you're serious, go ahead
and tear whole place down!

1024
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:05,190
A smart-ass, eh? Tear it down!

1025
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:06,860
Be cool!

1026
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:33,640
Why's this music so gloomy?

1027
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:37,910
It's a funeral dirge.
Gotta be gloomy to make people cry.

1028
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,450
I don't like it.

1029
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:44,620
Save it for Lucy's funeral.

1030
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:50,760
Lucy's a nice girl. For her sake,
come up with something else.

1031
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:13,450
Attention, everyone!

1032
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:18,100
Let's try the same dirge,
only with a happier feel.

1033
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:24,030
At double the tempo!

1034
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:28,630
One, two, three, four.

1035
01:24:07,910 --> 01:24:09,540
I don't get it.

1036
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:13,950
If you're copying another product
why spend so much on ads?

1037
01:24:14,150 --> 01:24:16,280
You don't understand capitalism.

1038
01:24:16,490 --> 01:24:19,950
With enough advertising,
the fake becomes the real.

1039
01:24:24,430 --> 01:24:26,420
- Pay them.
- Lucy, wait a sec!

1040
01:24:26,630 --> 01:24:28,100
Let's hear it again.

1041
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:32,260
- Everything's taken care of.
- I don't wanna hear it anymore!

1042
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:35,130
Take your stupid funeral
and go to hell!

1043
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:37,830
Talk to Tyler.
He woke up a while ago.

1044
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:40,600
He and Tony wouldn't let me tell you.

1045
01:24:40,810 --> 01:24:44,610
But I can't keep up the act.
They're playing with you.

1046
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:11,110
Why, Tyler? Why did you put him
in charge of your funeral?

1047
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:15,470
Hey, one of first things
that Confucius said was:

1048
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:19,550
"Aren't friends from far away
a joyful thing?"

1049
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:22,150
For me, I think what he meant was:

1050
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:26,310
"No, not necessarily.
Not if you are truly Ionely."

1051
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:29,890
- Thanks a lot.
- This isn't about you and Tony.

1052
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:31,690
This is about me.

1053
01:25:32,030 --> 01:25:35,160
Right, but look at where it's got you.

1054
01:25:35,370 --> 01:25:36,990
This is wonderful.

1055
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:40,100
All the emperors
had their funerals here.

1056
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:44,240
Yo Yo was just trying to move me
from mortal to immortal.

1057
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:48,670
You don't think my soul would be good
in a little baby girl?

1058
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:52,480
It's not a joke, Tyler,
it's embarrassing.

1059
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:56,810
Yeah, well, I guess
if I had actually died...

1060
01:25:57,020 --> 01:26:00,580
...you guys wouldn't be happy
with this, would you?

1061
01:26:00,790 --> 01:26:05,190
But you would have been remembered
by all this... Damn it, Tyler!

1062
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:10,160
After all you've done, your great work,
to have this be your memorial?

1063
01:26:10,370 --> 01:26:14,700
But I'm still alive, sweetie.
So in the grand scheme of things...

1064
01:26:14,910 --> 01:26:18,870
...the Almighty was using Yo Yo
and his brilliant creation...

1065
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:21,240
...for a totally different reason.

1066
01:26:21,450 --> 01:26:24,810
- Tyler, you used him.
- I don't think so.

1067
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:28,980
When you think about it,
I wanted to stop directing. Why?

1068
01:26:29,190 --> 01:26:32,710
I thought everything
I'd ever done was unworthy.

1069
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:35,420
I just wanted to up and die.

1070
01:26:36,230 --> 01:26:38,250
I'd lost all faith in myself.

1071
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:42,660
And that morning when I was making
that film with Yo Yo...

1072
01:26:43,030 --> 01:26:45,160
...all of a sudden...

1073
01:26:45,370 --> 01:26:47,360
...everything turned blue.

1074
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:51,800
I was in this
pearl-blue tunnel, sweetie.

1075
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:55,340
And way at the bottom of it,
there was...

1076
01:26:55,550 --> 01:27:00,110
...this white light beckoning to me
and I was floating towards it.

1077
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:05,190
But I could hear this voice
up above me, calling.

1078
01:27:05,390 --> 01:27:07,410
Yelling at me:

1079
01:27:07,630 --> 01:27:09,590
"Hey, old man.

1080
01:27:09,790 --> 01:27:11,630
Don't go there.

1081
01:27:11,830 --> 01:27:13,730
Come back.

1082
01:27:14,430 --> 01:27:16,920
You still have work to do."

1083
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:21,600
And I forced myself out of that coma.

1084
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:25,170
And when I opened my eyes...

1085
01:27:25,610 --> 01:27:28,810
...there, sitting in front of me, was...

1086
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:32,880
...this magical screenplay
and the name of its author.

1087
01:27:33,820 --> 01:27:36,550
- Yo Yo?
- Yo Yo, my man.

1088
01:27:37,290 --> 01:27:38,850
Messenger from heaven.

1089
01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:43,050
That's the real reason
I asked him to arrange my funeral.

1090
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:45,020
To save my life.

1091
01:27:45,230 --> 01:27:48,690
To give me this perfect movie to make.

1092
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:51,130
He's my angel.

1093
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:55,760
Your angel's going straight to hell...

1094
01:27:55,970 --> 01:27:59,600
...if you don't do something
to get him out of this mess.

1095
01:28:03,810 --> 01:28:08,750
When will the lousy old fart die?
Will he live until the next century?

1096
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:13,650
If Tyler recovered, have you
considered what we would do?

1097
01:28:13,860 --> 01:28:18,800
That's impossible! He has to die!
And if he doesn't, he better fake it!

1098
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:22,630
Our clients don't care
if the corpse is dead or alive.

1099
01:28:22,830 --> 01:28:26,830
They're only concerned
about our advertising power!

1100
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:29,130
I hope you're joking.

1101
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:32,240
What if I'm not?

1102
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:33,840
Then...

1103
01:28:34,950 --> 01:28:37,780
...I'll kill the goddamn bastard!

1104
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:48,020
He recovered.

1105
01:29:01,270 --> 01:29:01,540
Months Later

1106
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:02,800
Months Later

1107
01:29:03,010 --> 01:29:05,170
Are you comfortable here?

1108
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:08,370
Can't afford to worry
about comfort now.

1109
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:10,310
Not enough time.

1110
01:29:10,510 --> 01:29:13,750
Just wish there were
48 hours in a day.

1111
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:16,250
Where'd you disappear to?

1112
01:29:16,450 --> 01:29:20,720
Tried calling you everywhere.
Many big decisions waiting on you.

1113
01:29:20,930 --> 01:29:25,160
I'm so busy with the new film,
I had no time to visit.

1114
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,660
Are you angry?

1115
01:29:28,070 --> 01:29:31,730
Don't worry.
We wouldn't abandon you here.

1116
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:34,940
I'm not sick. Just tired.

1117
01:29:35,140 --> 01:29:38,940
I'll need a long vacation
after the funeral's over.

1118
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:42,580
Right now my mind is
full of advertisements.

1119
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:45,210
Since we IPO'd...

1120
01:29:45,550 --> 01:29:50,990
...our every move directly
affects the NASDAQ.

1121
01:29:51,190 --> 01:29:52,520
Yo Yo.

1122
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,050
Tyler is fine.

1123
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:57,250
There's no funeral. It's all over.

1124
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:01,890
Why won't you believe me?

1125
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:05,360
You don't have to worry
about the advertisers.

1126
01:30:05,570 --> 01:30:08,090
Tyler pre-sold his funeral rights.

1127
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:10,540
He loved your concept so much...

1128
01:30:10,740 --> 01:30:13,610
...he's making it into a movie.

1129
01:30:13,810 --> 01:30:18,080
Really. Everything's settled.
You've got to believe me.

1130
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:26,920
Tyler's death was hard on you.

1131
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:30,960
Must be hard to accept.
I feel the same way.

1132
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:37,790
Which is why we have to give him
a really successful funeral.

1133
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:42,600
We can't dishonor his faith in us!
Nor his trust.

1134
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:45,570
I designed a sample invitation.

1135
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:50,610
Internet CEOs and a real estate mogul
are staying in this hotel...

1136
01:30:50,810 --> 01:30:53,080
...all dying to advertise with us.

1137
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:55,680
But there wasn't any space left.

1138
01:30:55,890 --> 01:31:00,480
So I got inspired and added an insert.

1139
01:31:00,930 --> 01:31:04,730
Have a look. If it works,
we should print it right away.

1140
01:31:05,660 --> 01:31:07,760
Not much time left.

1141
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,090
You like it?

1142
01:31:12,670 --> 01:31:16,700
The reason I came here was
to check on your condition.

1143
01:31:16,910 --> 01:31:21,170
If you were better,
I could take you home with me.

1144
01:31:21,380 --> 01:31:26,010
But the doctor says the treatment
has been very conservative.

1145
01:31:26,220 --> 01:31:29,350
Pills, mostly.
With no sign of progress.

1146
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:30,820
So he recommended...

1147
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:35,190
...we try electroshock therapy.

1148
01:31:35,690 --> 01:31:39,690
Apparently, it's quite painful.

1149
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:43,030
Afterwards, you'll pass out...

1150
01:31:44,370 --> 01:31:46,430
...and go into spasms.

1151
01:31:48,110 --> 01:31:50,040
Treatment would be once a day...

1152
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:52,700
...for about 1 <i>5</i> days.

1153
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:57,800
If the results aren't promising,
they'll try another round.

1154
01:31:58,120 --> 01:32:01,850
So the bastards finally got
their dirty hands on me.

1155
01:32:15,570 --> 01:32:20,530
I must call Tyler! He's taking me
to America! I want him to take me now!

1156
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:22,260
Thank God!

1157
01:32:22,970 --> 01:32:25,340
You believe he's still alive?

1158
01:32:28,450 --> 01:32:29,610
I was faking.

1159
01:32:30,110 --> 01:32:31,670
What?!

1160
01:32:32,050 --> 01:32:34,980
I feared the advertisers
coming after me.

1161
01:32:37,190 --> 01:32:39,780
But Louis isn't faking.

1162
01:32:50,170 --> 01:32:52,430
It feels good!

1163
01:32:56,970 --> 01:32:59,370
So there's this mental hospital...

1164
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:04,170
...overcrowded with patients,
all mentally retarded...

1165
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:07,410
...and not enough nurses
or doctors on staff.

1166
01:33:07,620 --> 01:33:12,080
The chief physician gets an idea:
Patients will supervise themselves.

1167
01:33:12,290 --> 01:33:15,020
Each floor will have
a patient monitor.

1168
01:33:15,230 --> 01:33:19,180
But the floor monitor has
to be minimally intelligent.

1169
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:22,420
So the doctor goes
to the first floor...

1170
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:25,730
...holds up an apple, and asks:

1171
01:33:25,940 --> 01:33:27,400
"What's this?"

1172
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:30,370
The patients all shake their heads.

1173
01:33:31,110 --> 01:33:34,740
Suddenly, one patient raises
his hand. "I know!"

1174
01:33:34,950 --> 01:33:37,440
The doctor says, "Tell us!"
"An apple!"

1175
01:33:37,650 --> 01:33:40,310
"What's it for?" asks the doctor.
"Eating!"

1176
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:44,190
The doctor says,
"You're the first floor monitor."

1177
01:33:44,390 --> 01:33:47,020
They're testing you. Don't screw up.

1178
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:52,220
The doctor goes to the second floor.
He holds up a banana and asks:

1179
01:33:52,430 --> 01:33:57,130
"Who can tell me what this is?"
The patients all shake their heads.

1180
01:33:57,330 --> 01:34:01,240
But one patient raises his hand.
"A banana."

1181
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:04,100
"And what's it for?"
"Eating."

1182
01:34:04,310 --> 01:34:07,000
"And how do you eat it?"
"Peel it!"

1183
01:34:07,210 --> 01:34:10,480
"Good!
You're the second floor monitor."

1184
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:15,850
So the doctor goes to the third floor.

1185
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:20,750
He takes out a... The thing
with a horn-shaped speaker...

1186
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:23,930
...and a handle you crank.
What it's called?

1187
01:34:24,130 --> 01:34:25,890
A gramophone!

1188
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:28,700
You're the third floor monitor!

1189
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:31,430
Cut!

1190
01:34:31,740 --> 01:34:36,170
This is perfect. The angel gets
the last laugh. The movie ends here.

1191
01:34:36,370 --> 01:34:38,000
That's a very bad idea.

1192
01:34:38,210 --> 01:34:41,740
Movies should have romantic,
sweet, lyrical endings.

1193
01:34:41,950 --> 01:34:45,280
Lucy's in love with Yo Yo.
We should see them in bed.

1194
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:49,650
The scene starts with a kiss.
Then they disrobe each other.

1195
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:53,450
- They embrace passionately. Yo Yo!
- In slow motion.

1196
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:58,320
This is your movie, your story,
your joke, the end. Okay?

1197
01:34:58,530 --> 01:35:01,290
- He said...
- I know.

1198
01:35:02,470 --> 01:35:05,440
Now. Stop. No good.

1199
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:09,500
I. Lucy. Together.

1200
01:35:09,710 --> 01:35:10,970
Go to bed.

1201
01:35:12,410 --> 01:35:14,100
Long time kiss.

1202
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:15,640
Music.

1203
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:17,610
Stop.

1204
01:35:17,820 --> 01:35:19,810
- Very good.
- Very good!

1205
01:35:20,020 --> 01:35:22,780
Lucy, come here. Sit down.

1206
01:35:23,490 --> 01:35:28,820
How many times have you promised me
you wouldn't argue with Uncle Tony?

1207
01:35:29,860 --> 01:35:33,760
Hey, do you like Yo Yo's ending?

1208
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:39,660
Whatever I support, it's just a movie.
It has nothing to do with real life.

1209
01:35:39,870 --> 01:35:41,300
Do you love him?

1210
01:35:41,510 --> 01:35:43,130
Tell me the truth.

1211
01:35:45,710 --> 01:35:48,510
God. Tony was right.

1212
01:35:48,710 --> 01:35:51,740
This is the truth of the movie.

1213
01:35:51,950 --> 01:35:55,110
Hey, I'll do it Yo Yo's way.

1214
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:59,020
It's just a movie.
It's all I got to give you.

1215
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:00,820
I love him too.

1216
01:36:22,410 --> 01:36:24,680
What are you thinking?

1217
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:28,280
Do I have to reveal all my secrets?

1218
01:36:28,490 --> 01:36:30,510
Fine, don't tell me.

1219
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,710
I'd better tell you.

1220
01:36:34,060 --> 01:36:35,650
I was thinking:

1221
01:36:35,860 --> 01:36:39,660
Should I help
with the necklace first...

1222
01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:44,800
...or touch your shoulders,
to test your response?

1223
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:49,700
Or, maybe just lift your face,
gaze deeply into your eyes...

1224
01:36:49,910 --> 01:36:52,930
...and attack you like a wild animal?

1225
01:36:53,710 --> 01:36:58,650
Or, if everything has gone
smoothly up to now...

1226
01:36:58,850 --> 01:37:03,550
...strike while the iron is hot,
and do something I'll regret later?

1227
01:37:03,750 --> 01:37:05,590
Or, just take my time...

1228
01:37:05,790 --> 01:37:08,760
...and wait for a better harvest?

1229
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:11,330
- Then I thought...
- What if I refuse?

1230
01:37:11,530 --> 01:37:14,960
- You'd do that?
- Don't know. Try your luck.

1231
01:37:15,170 --> 01:37:17,260
Then wish me luck!

1232
01:37:30,310 --> 01:37:33,410
Better do it from the front.

1233
01:37:36,820 --> 01:37:38,850
What are you doing?

1234
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:42,660
Come on, guys.

1235
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:46,490
I'm not gonna say cut until you kiss.

1236
01:37:50,270 --> 01:37:51,430
Cut.

1237
