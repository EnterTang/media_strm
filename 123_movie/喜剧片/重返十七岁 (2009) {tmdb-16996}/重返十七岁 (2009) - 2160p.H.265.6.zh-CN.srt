You play half the game. I know you're capable of.

8
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,270
他打算提供给你全额奖学金
He's prepared to offer you a full scholarship.

9
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,480
大学的免费直通车  孩子  你的前途很光明
Free ride to college and the world's your oyster, kid.

10
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,990

都给我上镜点
Try not to break the camera.

13
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,910
等会儿  内德还没来
We gotta hang on. Ned's not here yet.

14
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,660
管他的  他不过是送水的
Who cares    He's the water boy.

15
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,170
这无所谓  但他是队里的一员
That doesn't matter, because he's part of the team.

16
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,840
对不起  我迟到了
Sorry I'm late   Sorry I'm late

17
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,670
如果我在和怪兽的大战中
But what kind of dungeon master would I be

18
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,350
中途开溜
if I left my party in the middle

19
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,050
我算哪门子的地下城主
of a battle with a hippogriff

20
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,140
瞧瞧  女孩版的麦林(亚瑟王中的魔法师）
Check it out, it's Merlin in the girlin.

21
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,259
内德  我是你最好的朋友
Um, Ned, Ned, look, I'm your best friend, all right,

22
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:46,980
我一直站在你这边
And I'll always have your back.

23
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,360
但当你穿着袍子出现时
But there's only so much I can do

24
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,060
我只有一件事能做
when you show up in a dress.

25
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,380
奥唐奈  你和小乔治
O'donnell. How about you and boy George

26
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,480
该归队了吧

27
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,230
是的  当然  稍等

请把牌子给那个小子  好啦
Give the little guy the sign, please. Here we are.

你们得把最帅的一面
Come on, you gotta look pretty

31
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,080
展现给那些女孩子们  对吧

我们还要比赛  让我们开场吧
We got a game here. Let's bring it in.

35
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,620
伙计  我是被逼的  我是被逼的
Man, I had to. I had to.

36
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,370
伙计  瞧那边
Oh, man, over there.

37
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,750
那个冷冰冰的狐狸精是谁
Who is that stonecold fox

38
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,300
是我女朋友
Oh, it's my girlfriend.

39
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,880
把他们一网打尽  老兄
Take no prisoners, bro.

40
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,470
我的女孩来啦
Oh, hey, there's my girl.

41
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,640
我真高兴你来了  斯嘉
I'm glad you're here, Scar.

42
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,640
球探要来  搞得我超紧张
This whole Scout thing has me wicked nervous.

43
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,640
我觉得我的未来就指望这场比赛了
I just feel like my whole future's riding on this game.

44
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,060

50
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,170
你还好吧
You okay

51
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,510
我们可以赛后再谈  不  就现在
We can talk about it later.   No. Just tell me.

52
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,420
今晚对你很重要  你该尽情享受
It's your big night. Go enjoy it.

53
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,430
除非你告诉我怎么了否则我无法享受它
I can't enjoy it unless you tell me what's going on.

54
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,850
好吧
Okay.

55
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,000
奥唐奈
O'donnell

56
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,390
清醒点

00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:20,310
你在干嘛
What are you doing

00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,890
斯嘉  等等
Scar   Scar, hey.

60
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,100
斯嘉丽
Hey, Scarlet.

61
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,520
喂  你在干什么
Hey, hey. Hey, what are you doing

62
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,820
麦克  你在干什么
Mike, what are you doing

63
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,110
听着  你和我  我们一起面对这件事  好不好
Look, you and me, we're in this together, okay

64
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,510
但是这场比赛  是你的未来
But the game. That's your future.

65
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,610
不  这个婴儿才是我的未来
No, the baby's my future.

66
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,950
你疯了  你是我的未来
That's crazy.   You're my future.

67
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,200
我不能让你抛弃这一切  我不会让你这么做
I can't let you throw this all away. I won't let you.

68
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,850
如今的麦克・奥唐奈

69
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,590
谢谢你让我住这  内德
Thank you for letting me stay here, Ned.

70
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,510
不客气  没什么
Oh, yeah. No problem.

71
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,510
你吃的惯麦片吗  吃的惯  很好
You good on the cap'n      I'm good on the captain.

72
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,180
麦克
Hey, Mike

73
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:24,690
麦克  我知道你很沮丧  但是有点你得相信我
Mike, I can tell you're down, but trust me on this.

74
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,520
你在等斯嘉丽
You're looking at Scarlet

75
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,520
把你踢出家门
kicking you out of the house

76
00:07:27,802 --> 00:07:28,890
而事实上孩子们
And the kids wanting nothing

77
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,990
不愿和你在一起  这也是不利因素
to do with you as a negative, when in fact

78
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,030
我猜大多都对你不利  是啊
I guess it's mostly negative, isn't it      Well, yeah.

79
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,370
我想不出有利的
I had no upside for that.

80
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,540
今天是你升职的大日子对吧
Hey   You're getting that big promotion today, right

81
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,380
是的  是的
Yes. Yes, I am.

82
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,210
今天是我转运的一天
Today everything turns around for me.

83
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,170
给他们好看
Knock them dead.

84
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,090
我爱你
I love you

85
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,400
所以不管怎样
So anyway

86
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,570
公司让我们拖延时间
the way corporate wants us to spin it

87
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,740
这种方式   可能就像在某些情况下
is that maybe, in certain situations

88
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:17,370
四小时的持续勃起并没那么糟
a fourhour erection isn't such a terrible thing.

89
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,750
好了  下一件事
OK. Next staff.

90
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,535
正如绝大多数人所知  今天我将荣幸

00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,750
来吧
Here we go.

93
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,560
我已经在制药业这行里
You know I've been in the pharmaceutical game

94
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,760
打拼了近两年了
for almost two years now

95
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,220
人们总是问我
And people always ask me

96
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,220
如何成为地区销售主管
      What's it take to be an RSM

101
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,940
所以恭喜  麦克
So congratulations. Mike.

102
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,524
麦克  如果你能往左靠一靠
Mike, if you could slide to your left

103
00:08:54,524 --> 00:08:56,824
我就可以恭喜我们的新地区销售主管了
so I can congratulate our new RSM,

104
00:08:56,824 --> 00:08:57,450
温蒂

我来告诉你怎么了
Well, I'll tell you what's crackalacking.

112
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,600
你耍我吧
Are you kidding me

113
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:24,470
温蒂在这干了2个月  我已经干了16年了
Wendy's been here two months. I've been here 16 years.

你可以把这看作对你的赞赏

就像我们说
Think of it as us saying,

117
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,070
升职已无法体现你的价值
      You're just too valuable to promote.      

118
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,820
你这个小
You little

还有好戏呢
Oh, and it gets better,

128
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,020
因为我们要去星期五狂欢

129
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,640

00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,890
高中明星

135
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,890
潜力无限
Never quite lived up to your potential.

136
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,480
迟早你会回到这所学校
Sooner or later you all come back to the old school.

137
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,110
站在这  凝望过去那些辉煌日子的照片
Stand there and look at the picture of the glory days

138
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,610
猜想原本会是什么样子
wondering what might have been.

139
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,950
在我看来  你们都活在过去
Seems to me you guys are living in the past.

140
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,320
我当然想回到过去
Well, of course I want to live in the past.

141
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,080
那的生活更好
It was better there.

142
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,960
我打赌你想重来一次
I'll bet you wish you had it to do all over again.

143
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,000
你说中了
You got that right.

144
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,130
你确定
You're sure about that

145
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,010
确定
Oh, yeah.

146
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,390
老爸  你好  奥唐奈先生
Dad.   Hi, Mr.O'donnell.

00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,050
小姐们好啊  你在这干嘛
Ladies.   What are you doing here

148
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,140
我刚刚在和
Oh, I was just talking to

149
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,480
没什么
nobody.

150
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:14,397
别管了
Doesn't matter.

151
00:12:14,397 --> 00:12:15,480
我今天下班早
I got off work early,

152
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,480
我想我们可以一起去吃冰激凌
and I thought we could get ice cream.

153
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,020
一起
Together

154
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,820
为什么  叫上你弟弟  好吧
Why      Just go get your brother, okay

155
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,160
还需要别的吗
Do you need anything else

156
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,950
不了  谢谢
No, we're fine.

157
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,500
怎么了  你们以前最喜欢这了
What's the matter    This used to be your favorite place.

158
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,970
我们曾来这给你过生日
We used to come here for your birthday.

159
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,670
没错  那时我才8岁
Yeah. When I was, like, 8.

160
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,180
艾尔  篮球赛季就要来了
So, Al, basketball season's coming up.

161
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,390
你准备好了  是的
You ready      Yeah.

162
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,350
在练习外线投篮吗
Been working on that outside shot

163
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,640
传球  很好
Passing      Good.

164
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,440
运球  很好
Dribbling      Really good.

165
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,520
只是好没法让你拿到奖学金
Good's not going to get you a scholarship.

166
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:00,360
我是说  好极了  好极了  老爸  非常好
I meant, it's great. It's great, Dad. It's great.

167
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,940
不愧是我儿子  记住  不在于你的身材有多壮
That's my boy. Remember, it's not how big you are.

168
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,400
而在于比赛中如何最大限度发挥你的作用
It's how big you play.

169
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,740
来
Right up here.

170
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,620
玛姬被乔治敦大学录取了

玛姬  太棒了
Maggie, that's awesome.

172
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,700
你能把这调小点声吗
Can you turn down the

173
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,100
好的  孩子们  回见
Okay, guys, see you soon.

174
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:40,060
我爱你们  很高兴和你们聊天
Love you. Nice chatting with you.

175
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:56,580
你在干嘛
What the hell are you doing

176
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,170
那是我的
Hey, that's my stuff.

177
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,880
你干嘛毁了我们的院子
Why are you destroying our yard

178
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,090
这不是我们的院子  是我的  记得吗
It's not our yard. It's my yard, remember

179
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,180
你选了马路  所以院子归我了
You took the road not taken. And I get the yard.

180
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,020
我要把它变成给我客户的示范地
I'm going to turn it into a showpiece for my clients.

181
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,400
什么客户  园艺设计
Clients of what      Landscape design.

182
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,770
园艺设计
Landscape design

183
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,280
我要向人们展示我能做的
I'm going to show people what I can do.

184
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,574
好吧  但是离婚
Yeah, well, the divorce isn't final

185
00:14:29,574 --> 00:14:30,274
两周后才生效
for another two weeks,

186
00:14:30,274 --> 00:14:31,450
所以你还没权利
So you do have no right.

187
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,525
是吗  过去18年我一直在
Really    So I've spent the last 18 years

188
00:14:34,525 --> 00:14:36,625
听你抱怨说如果不是我的话
of my life listening to you whine about the things

189
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,210
你能做什么  你却说我没权利
you could've done without me, and I have no right

190
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,580
只是  我花了很多心血在这
It's just I put a lot of work into this yard.

191
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,580
是吗
Did you

192
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,130
是吗  比如那个烤肉专用坑
Really    Like the barbeque pit

193
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,550
是的
Yeah.

194
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,500
根据我的记忆
The way I remember that is that

195
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,800
你曾花一个小时弄好它
you spent about an hour working on it

196
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,560
却在接下来两天里
and then you spent the next two days

197
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,570
抱怨说如果你上了大学
complaining about if you had gone to college,

198
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,970
你就可以雇个人做
you could've hired someone to do it.

199
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,590
没两天吧
I don't think it was a whole two days.

200
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,390
那边的吊床呢
Or the hammock over here.

201
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,650
怎么了
Yeah.

202
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,700
我想你之所以放弃那个
I think you quit that one

203
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,900
是因为你已决定不再尝试
because you just decided not to try anymore.

204
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,690
试着站在我的立场看待这一切
Look, try to see things from my point of view.

205
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,570
我对我的人生失望透顶
I am extremely disappointed with my life.

206
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,490
我从没要求你娶我
I never asked you to marry me.

207
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,990
没有  但我这么做了
Yeah, but I did.

208
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,460
那今后你不用再帮我什么了
You don't have to do me any more favors, then.

209
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:28,090
我们也不会再去挽回对方了
We're not going to hold each other back anymore, okay

210
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,800
斯嘉  我们法庭上见  听审时
Scar    I'll see you at court, okay    At the trial.

211
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,300
斯嘉丽
Scarlet.

Naomi

213
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,680
你来了  当然我会来
You came.  Of course I came.

214
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,420
如果我不在你离婚时陪伴你
What bridesmaid would I be

215
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,220
我还算什么伴娘
if I didn't hold your hand during the divorce

216
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:44,100
现在  记住  第一次总是最难的
Now, just remember. The first one's always the hardest.

217
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,610
麦克  奈奥蜜
Mike.   Naomi.

218
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,150
是内奥蜜  管你叫什么
Naomi.   I don't care.

219
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,440
我们走  我们得让你做好准备
Let's get going. We got to get you ready.

220
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,440
重回这行
Back on the market.

221
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,820
没错  我很在行
Yeah, I'm a real catch.

222
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,330
单身母亲带着两个十几岁的孩子
Single mom with two teenage kids

223
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,030
却不得不去摆弄肥料
and manure caked under my fingernails.

224
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,660
你能行的  你能把12岁的男孩搞上床
You'll do great. You got the butt of a 12yearold boy.

225
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,120
好极了  希望我们的女儿能听到
That's terrific. I hope our daughter heard that.

226
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,830
你多久没做爱了
When was the last time you waxed

227
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,670
再见  麦克

228
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,390
再见
Bye.

229

你确定吗
You're sure about that

230
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,260
上帝
Jesus.

231
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,400
快下来
Hey   Get off of there

a Norse God, vampire, or timetraveling cyborg

278
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,500
我们什么时候认识的  一年级
I've known you since, what, first grade

279
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,400
如果有的话我早告诉你了
Maybe I would have told you.

280
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,150
吸血鬼不会说的  生化人自己不会知道
Vampire wouldn't tell. Cyborg wouldn't know.

281
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,820
闭嘴
Shut up.

282
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,545
好吧  如果不属于这些情况
Okay, if it's not any of those,

283
00:22:07,545 --> 00:22:09,945
我猜  我们得瞧瞧你基本的
I guess, um, we're looking at your basic

284
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,540
灵媒变身魔术
spirit guide transformation magic.

285
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,540
事实这可算个大问题
That's kind of a biggie, actually.

286
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,460
找到了
That is here.

287
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,370
当英雄
When the hero

288
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,000
我猜这指的是 我猜是你
I guess that's  I guess, you.

289
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:25,920
被他的灵媒变身
uh, is transformed by his spirit guide

290
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,760
并重新安排他的人生
to set him on a new path.

291
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,590
什么意思  我看起来像你的灵魂向导吗
Which is what      Do I look like your spirit guide

292
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,850
那个清洁工
The janitor.

293
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,940
清洁工
The janitor.

294
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,450
你们看到清洁工了吗  你们看到清洁工了吗
You guys seen the janitor    You seen the janitor

295
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,040
你知道清洁工在哪吗  不知道
Do you know where the janitor is      No.

296
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,290
清洁工在哪  他在哪工作
Hey, where's the janitor    Where does the janitor work

297
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,460
抱歉  你没事吧  孩子
Excuse me     You all right, kid

298
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,960
这的另一个清洁工  就我一个
There's another janitor who works here.   Just me.

299
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,560
不  不  这还有一个
No, no. There's an older guy

300
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,960
白发的老头也在这工作
with white hair who works here.

301
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,716
我昨天还在这和他谈话
I was here yesterday talking to the janit

302
00:23:11,716 --> 00:23:13,760
我给他看了我的这张照片
I showed him this picture of me.

303
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:16,060
你的照片  是的
You      Yeah.

304
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,970
那张照片是1989年拍的
That picture's from 1989.

305
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,810
是啊  算了
Right. Forget it.

306
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,780
阿莱克斯
Alex

307
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,320
阿莱克斯  老兄
Alex, buddy

308
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,740
阿莱克斯
Alex

309
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,990
有人在吗
Hello

310
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,160
灵媒  是你吗
Spirit guide

311
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,660
我该怎么办
What am I supposed to do

312
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,370
我不知道该怎么办
Don't know what I'm supposed to do.

313
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,260
我被打中了  我被打中了吗 有个兵被干掉了
I got shot. Did I get shot or did I get     Someone got powned.

314
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,060
是个手榴弹  内德
It's a grenade.  Ned.

315
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,140
什么  唉  年轻版的你
Aah   Oh, sorry. Teenage you.

316
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:45,190
我想明白了  我知道该怎么做了
I figured it out. I figured out what I'm supposed to do.

317
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,560
我知道灵媒要我做什么了
I figured out what my spirit guide wants me to do.

318
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:48,980
我要回去
I'm going back.

319
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,400
我要重回高中
I'm going back to high school, Ned

320
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:56,070
不不  这不可能
No   No, no. No way.

321
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,070
你的灵媒不会将变形的魔法浪费在
Your spirit guide would not waste transformation magic

322
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,910
让你重回高中和做返校节国王上  不可能
On you reliving your senior year and going to prom. No.

323
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:07,000
内德  这是我重塑人生的机会  让一切变好
Ned, this is my chance to have my life over, but to do it right.

324
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,340
换作是你  也会这么做吧  不会
Wouldn't you, if you had the chance     No.

325
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,090
我很富有  今天没人找我麻烦
I'm rich, and nobody stuck my head in a toilet today.

326
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,010
是吗  再说这也不光是为了我自己
Sure. Besides, it's not just about me.

327
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:18,260
是为了你  不  远不只是为了我
It's about you.  No, it's much bigger than me.

328
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,550
就是为了你  好吧  或许是为了我
It's about you.  Okay, maybe it's about me

329
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,260
但那又有什么错
But what's wrong with that

330
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,390
1989年以后我就没为自己活过
I have not done anything for me since 1989.

331
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,768
你爱怎么着都行
You do what you have to do.

332
00:25:27,768 --> 00:25:30,360
但是别让我和你一起趟这浑水
But don't think about sucking me into this with you.

333
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,400
海顿高中是我人生的低谷
Hayden was the low point of my existence

334
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:36,860
我发誓绝对不会再回到那鬼地方
And I vowed I would never go back to that godforsaken place

335
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:40,280
绝不  从不
Never, ever, ever

336
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,700
永不  绝不  从不  永不
Never   Never, ever, ever

337
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,580
我恨你
I hate you.

338
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,130
您好
Hello.

339
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,300
我来为儿子
I'm here to enroll my son

340
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,420
办入学手续
In school.

341
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,010
他叫马克
Mark.

342
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,140
您好啊
What's up

343
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,680
那么
So

344
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,480
我们先坐下等您一会儿
So we'll just have a seat till you're ready for us.

345
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,480
我们马上 好吧
We'll be right, uh  okay.

346
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:22,660
你穿的像什么样子
What's this you're wearing

347
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:25,874
很酷  嬉皮士风格
This is cool. This is hip.

348
00:26:25,874 --> 00:26:29,250
凯文・费德林也有过相似的打扮
I have a picture of Kevin Federline wearing the same thing.

349
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,670
我不认得  你穿的什么
I don't know who that is.  What are you wearing

350
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,250
你穿的像个老爹  我本来就是
I told you, like a dad.  I am.

351
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,590
你看起来像克莱・艾肯  别提他了
You look like Clay Aiken.  Leave him out of this.

352
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:42,220
你确定这些不会穿帮吗  当然不会  我是谁啊
Are you sure these look legit     Oh, yeah. Look who you're talking to.

353
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,633
我发明了软件
I'm the guy who invented the software

354
00:26:44,633 --> 00:26:47,180
防止人们窃取音乐
That prevents people from stealing music.

355
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,480
我还发明了帮助人们窃取音乐
I also invented the software that helps people steal music

356
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,020
但那只是个美妙的插曲
But that's a happy coincidence.

357
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,480
那是什么
What is that

358
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,030
我的天啊
Oh, my g

359
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,950
拿错了  那些是我的  你开什么玩笑
Wrong. These are for me.  You kidding

360
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:02,279
她叫什么名和奇威是我的
What'shername and Chewie's for me.

361
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,870
可以去见马斯特森小姐了
Miss Masterson will see you now.

362
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,120
走吧
Let's go.

363
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,540
不要闹笑话
Just don't try to be funny, all right

364
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,790
少说少错
Say as little as possible.

365
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,460
看路  土包子
Hey, watch where you're going, toolbag.

366
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:17,090
很抱歉  是我们不好  斯坦
So sorry, sir. Our fault.  Stan.

367
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:25,680
你好  我是简・马斯特森  海顿高中校长
Hello. I'm Jane Masterson, principal here at Hayden High.

368
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,390

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,870
可以松手了
Yeah, I think we're good here.

373
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,790
抱歉
Sorry.

374
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,830
我们刚才的握手产生了爱的结晶
I think our hands just made a baby.

375
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,794
请原谅我父亲
Excuse my dad.

376
00:27:57,795 --> 00:28:00,710
他不太喜欢和迷人的女士交谈
he's not used to talking to attractive women.

377
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,510
谢谢你的
Oh, thank you

378
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,550
我叫马克  马克

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,390
谢谢你那不合时宜的恭维
For that flattering yet totally inappropriate comment.

380
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,770
请坐
Please sit.

381
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:15,940
谈话开始前  我想告诉您  马克是个杂种
Before we get started, I think you should know that, uh, Mark's a bastard.

382
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,400
什么
Excuse me

383
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:20,570
他是非婚生子  也就是说
I had him out of wedlock, so

384
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,950
我是单身
I'm single.

385
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,450
钻石王老五
And I'm very rich.

386
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,280
好吧
Okay.

387
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,950
你带来成绩单了吗  是的

你之前在康涅狄格州的卡特勒高中
Last school you went to was Cutler High in Connecticut.

390
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,210

394
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,980
海顿高中有幸请你入学
Well, I think Hayden would be lucky to have you.

395
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:00,110
欢迎  谢谢
Welcome.  Thank you.

396
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,820
高德先生  您还有什么问题
Uh, yes, Mr. Gold. Do you have a question

397
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,830
你的头发很美
Your hair is pretty.

398
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,080
虽然不是个问题  不过谢谢你
Ah. Not a question, but thank you.

399
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,750
我可以嗅一下你秀发的味道吗
Would the lady mind if I smelled it

400
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,573
我想该跟你说明白
Now is probably a good time to tell

401
00:29:21,573 --> 00:29:23,510
我们不准和学生家长约会
You that I don't date students' parents.

402
00:29:24,448 --> 00:29:26,554
我也该向你申明
Maybe I should tell you that I never

403

我和所有我孩子的校长都约过会
Don't not date the principal of my child.

404
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,970
好了  爸爸  好啦
Okay, come on, dad. Come on, dad.

405
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,220
走吧
Let's go.

406
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,980
就快说完了
I was about to close

407
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:40,360
你想表现好吗  那就沉着点  你是个父亲
You have to do it right now    Just calm down. You're a dad.

408
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,614
天啊  我们置身其中了
Hi. oh, my gosh. we're in.

409
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:44,150
看见她那赤裸裸的眼神没
You see her undress me with her eyes

410
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,150
我可不这么想
I don't think that's what that was.

411
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,450
真不敢相信我们做到了
Hey. wow. I don't know how we did it.

412
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,240
那是玛姬的朋友  看着
It's Maggie's friends. Watch this.

413
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,950
姑娘们  怎么样  你是谁啊
Hey, girls, how's it going      Do I know you

414
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,410
当你自己是谁  明星么
What'd you do, mug kfed

415
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:02,380
欢迎来到金字塔底部
Welcome to the bottom of the food chain.

416
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:07,970
在高中永远有我支持你
Hey, look, you always had my back in high school, okay

417
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:10,890
如果你的灵媒要你假扮青少年
So if your spirit guide wants you to be a fake teenager

418
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,010
我愿意做你的假老爸
And me to be your fake dad

419
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:16,350
至少我能保证自己的假儿子看上去
The least I can do is make sure that my fake son doesn't look

420
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,020
不那么傻气
Like a total douche.

421
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,230
我才不傻  真是个傻冒儿
I don't look like a douche.   What a douche.

422
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:24,440
我们去采购
We're going shopping.

423
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:27,240
真的  没错  你的上衣让人看了眼晕
Really     Yes, your shirt is bedazzled.

424
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,740
是宝石晃眼
Bedazzled with rhinestones.

425
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,100
去上学吧
Let's go to school.

426
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,430
快看呐  老兄
Hey, yo, check it out.

427
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,100
真嚣张
That's just rude.

428
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,180
你看什么
What's up, dude

429
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,690
你乱看什么  小阿飞
What are you looking at, punk

430
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,150
看着点  醒醒吧  傻子
Watch it.  Wake up, douche.

431
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,740
抱歉
Sorry.

432
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:01,160
别打电话  别发短信
No phones, no texting.

433
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,580
坐好  大家都坐好
Settle, people. Settle down.

434
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:08,420
禁止在教室打闹
Take the roughhousing outside, class.

435
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,640
你好
Hello

436
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,930
你好  你到底在哪儿
Hello     Where the hell are you

437
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,520
我的天
Oh, cr

438
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,690
是那件事  你是说我们的离婚
The thing.   You mean our divorce

439
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,610
你到底有没有认真对待这事儿
Do you take any of this seriously

440
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:29,820
没有  不  我很认真
No, no   Yes, I take this seriously.

441
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:33,610
我突然需要出国
I had to leave the country very suddenly, uh

442
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,260
去和玛雅人和印加人
With the Mayan  Inca,

443
00:32:35,261 --> 00:32:36,530
我现在秘鲁和印加人在一起
I'm with the Incas in Peru.

444
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,660
我想我们能找到新的
We think we might have found the next

445
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,040
生发剂
rogaine.

446
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,370
你和一个女孩在一起
Are you with a girl

447
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:47,380
没有  只不过是一群啦啦队员
No, no. It's, uh, a bunch of cheerleaders.

448
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:51,000
你能和10年级生约会吗
So would you consider maybe dating a 10thgrader

449
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,050
我认为抚养权可以完全归你
I think we could go for full custody.

450
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,300
不  你不能把孩子夺走
No, you can't take my kids away from me.

451
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,550
你何时开始关心了
Since when do you care

452
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,310
听着
Look

453
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,690
我和他们的距离  远比你想像的要近
I'm a lot closer to them than you think.

454
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,230
我们再谈  好吗
Let's reschedule, okay

455
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,280
玛姬
Hey, Maggie.

456
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:20,080
为什么这个新生朝我挥手
Um, why is the new kid waving at me

457
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,990
我不知道
I don't know.

458
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,160
如果这男孩是苹果的话
But if that boy were an apple

459
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:25,790
味道一定不错
He'd be a delicious.

460
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,080
天啊
Oh, god.

461
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:35,510
天  我们身材都很棒
Gosh, we are all in such great shape.

462
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:40,510
知道吗  跟你透露个秘密
Man, you know, I will tell you something.

463
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,600
再过10年  我们就该有啤酒肚了
In 10 years you're going to have this thing right here

464
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:46,476
做多少仰卧起坐都减不下去
That no amount of crunches will get rid of.

465
00:33:46,476 --> 00:33:48,400
局部瘦身   全是胡说
And spot reduction, total lie.

466
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,440
我
You know, I

467
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,570
别介意  把球给我
Never mind. Give me the ball.

468
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,780
假动作向右  实际向左
Fakes right, goes left.

469
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,900
经典上篮
And signature move.

470
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,780
孩子
Kid.

471
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,910
我是墨菲教练
I'm coach Murphy.

472
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,620
你还没退休  什么
You're still here     What

473
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:12,090
你是个传奇人物
You're a legend.

474
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,510
是啊  不过是二十年前
Yeah. Well, yeah. Twenty years.

475
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:18,180
这是我带的最后一届了
It's actually my last one.

476
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:21,090
跳跃力很好  控球不错
Good hops, kid. nice handle.

477
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,220
我们需要一个得分后卫
We're looking for a point guard.

478
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,810
是吗
Oh, yeah

479
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,150
为什么不来试试  好的
Why don't you come to tryouts     Okay.

480
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,570
我说完了  好的
I'm done talking to you.  yeah, yeah.

481
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,610
进展如何
Hey, how's it going

482
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,820
一起顺利
Things are looking up.

483
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:41,820
墨菲教练邀我入队
Coach Murphy practically put me on the team.

484
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:44,580
这不是个巧合  一切都在步入正轨
That's not a coincidence. We're on the path.

485
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,223
很好
That's great.

486
00:34:45,223 --> 00:34:48,000
你正找回自己的命运  等等等等
That's super you're finding your destiny and, blah, blah, whatever.

487
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,580
有件事情  我需要你帮忙
Here's something. I need you to do something for me.

488
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,330
我需要你惹点事
I need you to get in trouble.

489
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,960
不要犯大事
Not, like, big trouble.

490
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:57,800
只要惹的麻烦足够让校长请家长就行
Just enough trouble so that the principal needs to meet with your father.

491
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,590
好吧  再说吧
Yeah, okay, well, we'll see.

492
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,800
内德  赢了
Oh   boom. Ned

493
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,100
萨米尔  将死
Boom. Checkmate, Samir

494
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,100
见鬼  将死
Damn it     Checkmate.

495
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:08,600
能帮我个忙吗
Uh, can I get a little help in here

496
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,600
阿莱克斯
Alex

497
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,860
怎么会
How does it

498
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:25,160
是谁干的  篮球队的人
Who did this to you     The basketball team.

499
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:29,700
为什么  你是他们的队友啊
But why    Why    You're one of them.

500
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,120
你人缘很好
You're popular.

501
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:35,960
这是私事  我又不认识你
Uh, look, this is kind of personal, and I don't know you.

502
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,340
我被粘在厕所上了  是啊
I'm taped to the toilet.  Yeah.

503
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,144
我是马克・高德
I'm sorry, I'm Mark Gold, uh,

504
00:35:39,145 --> 00:35:42,050
是你内德叔叔的儿子  我刚刚转来
your uncle Ned's kid. I just started here.

505
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,300
不错  很好
Oh, cool. Cool, yeah.

506
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:46,680
我很想和你握手
Well, I'd shake your hand

507
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,970
但手被粘在屁股上了  没关系
But it's taped to my ass.  Right. right.

508
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,350
能帮个忙吗
Would you mind

509
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,230
当然  当然  谢谢
Yeah, yeah, sure.  Yeah, um.

510
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,560
撕开就行  我来撕
Just rip.  I'm going to get it.

511
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:57,860
是胶布  撕吧
Bandaid.  Go for it.

512
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,910
为什么我们从未谋面
So how come we never met

513
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:08,910
我妈不想让人知道我是内德的私生子
My mom didn't want anyone to know she had a kid with Ned.

514
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,160
这倒是  是啊
That makes sense.  Yeah.

515
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:14,250
我们就像家人一样
So since we're practically family and all

516
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,920
爸爸说我们应该互相照顾  你说呢
My dad says we should just keep an eye on each other, you know

517
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,550
当然  为什么不呢
Uh, yeah. Why not

518
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,760
下次你可以在他们把我绑在马桶之前救我
Next time you could get there before they tape me to the toilet.

519
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,470
没错
You got it.

520
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,390
看上去很美味
This looks good.

521
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,480
那是谁
Who's that

522
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,770
妮可  你们两个要约会
Nicole.  Are you two going out

523
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,480
不  不  她是啦啦队长
No, no, she's the, uh, head cheerleader.

524
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,450
她不会和我约会的
She'd never go out with me.

525
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:46,450
我第一次见到你妈妈的时候  很是紧张
You know, when I first met your mother, I was so nervous

526
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,120
你见过我妈妈

527

什么  我妈妈
What     My mother.

528
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,410
你说你第一次见到我妈的时候很紧张
You said,       the first time I met your mother, I was nervous.      

529
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,710
真是奇怪  你妈妈很火辣吗  老兄
Oh, that's weird. is your mom hot     Dude, what

530
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,790
要我怎么回答  我只是在开玩笑
What do I say to that     I was joking. joking, dude.

531
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,970
斯坦
Stan.

532
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,140
我讨厌那人
I hate that guy.

533
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,970
天  多谢
Oh.  Thanks.

534
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,180
想怎样
What

535
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,520
新生  三明治不错
Freshman. Good sandwich.

536
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,150
就是那个人把你绑在马桶上吗
Is that the guy who taped you to the toilet

537
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,520
没错
Yeah.

538
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:23,740
昨天他在我家把我塞进了洗衣机
Yesterday he shoved me in a washing machine in my own house.

539
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:27,320
那混蛋在你家干什么  他是玛姬的男朋友
What was that jerk doing at your house     It's Maggie's boyfriend.

540
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,660
玛姬居然有个男朋友
Maggie has a boyfriend

541
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:37,500
我对你姐姐很失望
I'm very disappointed in your sister.

542
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:41,920
他在看你  别看着他  他脾气暴躁
He's looking. Don't make eye contact. He's kind of temperamental.

543
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,340
你在看他  别看了  别看了  就是要看他
You're looking. stop it, stop it.  I'll look at him.

544
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,380
这不是发光的傻冒儿吗
Hey, twinkle douche.

545
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:53,270
早知道你在食堂就该把你和煮饭婆绑一起
If I wanted you in the cafeteria, I would've taped you to a lunch lady.

546
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,270
你这个小阿飞
You little punk.

547
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,690
别这么跟他说话
You don't talk to him that way.

548
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:02,980
怎么
Yeah

549
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,860
你能怎么样
What are you gonna do

550
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:11,990
我能怎么样
What am I gonna do

551
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:15,660
首先
First

552
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,670
我要向你父亲告状
I'm going to call your father.

553
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,800
我警告你
Heads up

554
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:35,220
把球给我  贱人
Give me my ball back, bitch.

555
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:37,730
斯坦  我真为你感到悲哀
You know, Stan, I feel sorry for you.

556
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,900
你不认识我  我真的认识
You don't know me.  Oh, but I do.

557
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,730
生活中一切完美
All too well.

558
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:44,770
你就是这种人
You're the man.

559
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,070
篮球队队长
Captain of the basketball team.

560
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,490
和漂亮女孩约会
Dates the pretty girls.

561
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:52,820
高中就像是你的王国
High school is your kingdom.

562
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,700
但是  大家注意
But, people

563
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,950
斯坦不过是个恶霸
Stan's a bully.

564
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,580
为什么呢
Why

565
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:02,654
斯坦专门欺负弱小的原因很简单
It'd be way too easy to say Stan preys

566
00:39:02,654 --> 00:39:05,710
因为他是个烂人
On the weak simply because he's a dick.

567
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,090
不
No.

568
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,420
不止这些
No, no.

569
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,260
斯坦这个人
Stan here

570
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:14,260
还不能单用烂人来定义
Is much more complex than that.

571
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,430
依据权威精神科医生所述
See, according to leading psychiatrists

572
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,890
称他为恶霸有以下三个原因
Stan's a bully for one of three reasons.

573
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,890
第一
One

574
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:25,730
在逞匹夫之勇的外表下
Underneath all of that male bravado

575
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:27,520
藏着一颗像不安的小女孩般的内心
There's an insecure little girl

576
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,780
使劲儿敲打着密室之门寻求出路
Banging on the closet door trying to get out.

577
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,370
像山顶洞人
Like a caveman

578
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,700
斯坦的脑瓜
stan's brain is

579
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:41,250
还没发育好呢
underdeveloped.

580
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,460
所以斯坦控制不了自己
Therefore, stan is unable to use selfcontrol.

581
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,800
才表现得咄咄逼人
And so he acts out aggressively.

582
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,280
原因之三
And the third reason.

583
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,430
斯坦那东西很小
Stan has a small wiener.

584
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:14,030
别伤了自己  大男孩
Don't hurt yourself, big boy.

585
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,920
21岁才能喝酒  谢了
Whoa, whoa, hey. drinking age is still 21, thank you very much.

586
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:30,920
除非那灵媒给你个假身份  这个只能我喝
Unless your spirit guide gave you a fake id, this is mine.

587
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,470
你吃的什么
What are you eating

588
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,390
不知道  就知道我太饿了
I don't even know. I just know I'm hungry.

589
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,020
老是饿
All the time.

590
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,890
行了  那样吃又不安全又不卫生
Okay, that's not safe or sanitary.

591
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,810
那罐是你的了  做好标记
That's your can now. we'll label it like that.

592
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,190
那么  今天上学都学什么了
So, what did you learn at school today

593
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,200
我是个不称职的老爸  我还以为不错呢
that I'm a bad dad.  I thought it was going great.

594
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:59,200
对我来说是棒极了
It was going fantastic for me.

595
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:00,790
然后呢
And then what

596
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,972
然后我发现我儿子
And then I found out my son spent the

597
00:41:04,972 --> 00:41:07,170
在学校的最后一年  被当成受气包耍
Last year being the school punching bag

598
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:11,090
又眼看我女儿跟个神经质的混蛋舌吻
and watched my daughter get a tongue bath from a psychopathic jackass.

599
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,130
高中很爽  不是吗
High school's delightful, isn't it

600
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,680
是啊  可我觉得我可能选错路了
Yeah. but I think I was wrong about my spirit path.

601
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,970
谁说对了  你看  我跟你说过
And who was right    see    I told you.

602
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,140
我说了不该回高中
I told you high school was the wrong thing.

603
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:25,020
回高中没错  但不是就篮球而言
High school was right, but it's not about basketball.

604
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,730
是为了帮阿莱克斯和玛姬
It's about helping alex and maggie.

605
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:34,490
好了  我要走了
All right. I'm getting out of here.

606
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,740
真恶心  孩子们需要他们的老爸
disgusting.  my kids need their father.

607
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:47,250
干吗呢  好啊  mark
what's going on     oh, hey, mark.

608
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,590
那什么
What was that

609
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,510
三分球啊
A threepointer.

610
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,380
能连续两次都投进吗
Can you do that twice in a row

611
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:05,850
好  看看给你点压力你怎么样
Okay. let's see you do it with a little pressure.

612
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:15,400
不错啊  你应该进校队
Wow, you're great. you should be on the team.

613
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:20,740
你应该加入的  我帮你
You should be on the team. I'm going to get you on the team.

614
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:24,740
就这样  这样一切就搞定了
That's it. that'll solve everything.

615
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,120
哥们儿  你说啥呢
Dude, what are you talking about

616
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:28,620
没什么
Nothing.

617
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,333
好开心啊
Well, that was fun.

618
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:39,720
我都有差不多一个多星期没好好玩了
I haven't been to happy hour in, like, a week and a half.

619
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:43,050
内奥蜜  谢谢你  我就需要这个
Naomi, thank you so much. that is exactly what I needed.

620
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,760
太好了
Oh, great.

621
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,480
麦克谁  麦克什么啊  没听说过这个人
Mike who     Mike who    I've never heard of the guy.

622
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,900
妈  这是马克  内德叔叔的私生子
Hey, mom, this is mark, uncle ned's bastard.

623
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,650
我知道是有人跟内德叔叔有过孩子
I know. someone had a kid with uncle ned. ew.

624
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,320
你没事吧  奥唐奈太太
You okay, mrs. o'donnell

625
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,160
没事
Yeah, I'm fine.

626
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:06,200
应该是      女士        孩子  是斯嘉丽女士 别忘了
It's       ms.,       kid. it's       ms.,       scarlet. don't forget that.

627
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:07,620
对
Oh, right.

628
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:18,260
你跟我老公长的这么像  是不是
You look just like my husband. doesn't he

629
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:21,720
我前夫  真是奇怪
My exhusband. that is so weird.

630
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,010
奇怪
It is weird.

631
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,850
怎么回事
What is that

632
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:26,470
斯嘉丽  过来
Scarlet, I need you to come.

633
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,850
奇怪
Weird.

634
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,520
看见那个没有  看见了
Do you see that     I did see it.

635
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,020
看见他了吗  她不错
You see him     She's nice.

636
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,440
但是看看他
But look at him.

637
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:36,770
你别再想着这家伙了  往前看
You gotta let that guy go, just out of your brain and move on.

638
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:39,940
我知道你心里难受  这是自然的
I know you need to grieve a relationship. it's only natural.

639
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:41,360
好吧
Okay.

640
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:44,120
你在这儿等着  我去闻闻他
You wait here. I'm going to go smell him.

641
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,620
别  别  亲爱的  你可不能跟青少年玩这个
No, no, no. sweetie. you're not allowed to smell teenagers.

642
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:51,040
亲爱的  你得听我说  是这样的
Sweetie, you need to hear me on this. here's the thing.

643
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:53,080
另外  你得明白
The other thing, you need to acknowledge

644
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:56,540
他跟高中的麦克长的一摸一样
that he looks exactly like mike used to look in high school.

645
00:43:56,710 --> 00:44:00,470
咱们已经说过了  我看见他了
We discussed that. I have looked at him.

646
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:02,720
你得去认识别人
You need to hook up with someone new.

647
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:07,720
没错  我值得有人冲我微笑  告诉我我很漂亮
Yeah, I deserve to have somebody smile at me and tell me I'm pretty.

648
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:09,560
没错  就算是
You do.  Even if it is

649
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,140
叫我跟他一起回家
to just get me to go home with him.

650
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:17,190
或者吃午饭  对  我们要给你找个新伙伴
Or lunch. but, yes, we're gonna find you a new playmate. ow

651
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,820
你这个小坏蛋
You little turd. you little snot.

652
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,490
是我的错  不好意思  抱歉
My bad. gosh, I'm so sorry.

653
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:25,740
我看我是有点心不在焉了  因为我在想alex
I guess I was, uh, kind of distracted, as I imagine alex was

654
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:29,200
听到他妈还不是单身的时候
at hearing about how his mother, who is still married, by the way

655
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:31,870
准备跟每个有机会认识的男人玩儿
is planning to run around with every guy she can get.

656
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,664
要是在阿富汗
If this is in afghanistan,

657
00:44:32,664 --> 00:44:35,830
她会被砍了手  让山羊拖过街的
She'd be dragged through the streets by goats with her hands cut off.

658
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,920
我只不过说说而已  奈奥蜜
I'm just saying. I'm just saying, naomi.

659
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:40,380
内奥蜜  管他呢
Naomi.  I don't care.

660
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:57,650
伙计们
hey, guys. oh.

661
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,770
安静一下  各位坐好
Okay, settle down. everybody take your seats.

662
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:03,610
谢谢  谢谢  谢谢  斯坦  谢谢你
Thank you, thank you. thank you, stan. thank you.

663
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:05,234
好的
Okay,

664
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:09,450
今天我们要继续讨论人类性行为
today we will be continuing our discussion on human sexuality.

665
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,981
就像我们谈论过的
And as we discussed,

666
00:45:11,982 --> 00:45:14,580
学校的官方政策是要禁止
the official school policy is abstinence.

667
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,460
很明智
Now, that is very sensible.

668
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:19,590
我很高兴这里的人思想都很健康
I'm glad that someone here has their head screwed on straight.

669
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:23,380
我想我们大家都应该做个禁欲的约定
I think all of us should make a pact to abstain from sex.

670
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,800
现在谁赞成我说的  各位
Now, who's with me, you guys    come on.

671
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:28,220
天啊
Oh, my god.

672
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:32,890
玛姬
maggie

673
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,270
不管怎么着  说真的吧
However, let's get real.

674
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,730
我知道要求高中生禁欲
I know asking high school seniors to be abstinent

675
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,820
就好像要求豪猪能拉出羊奶酪一样  恶心
is like asking a porcupine to poop goat cheese. yuck.

676
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:45,071
由于你们中的大多数人
So since the majority of you are or

677
00:45:45,071 --> 00:45:47,490
在某个时候性行为比较活跃
Will become sexually active at some point

678
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:52,450
不过那个时期应该是很久以后了  对吧
But that point should be way, way in the future, right

679
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:55,120
那么  学校官方的立场是
Well, the official school position

680
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:57,500
我们为你们的安全性行为做了准备
is that we prepare you for safe sex now.

681
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,670
请每人领一个  挨个传下去
So please take one and pass it down.

682
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:09,340
我需求很大
I have needs.

683
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:14,770
没必要拿那么多  斯坦  给马克一个
You don't need these. stan, give one to mark.

684
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:19,100
不  不  他说的对  我不需要
No. no, you know what, he's right. he's right. I don't need one.

685
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:21,055
知道为啥我不要吗
You know why I don't need one

686
00:46:21,056 --> 00:46:23,020
因为我没爱上任何一个人
because there's no one I'm in love with.

687
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:25,230
那是      做爱      对吗
It's called       making love,       isn't it

688
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,947
可能我的思想落伍了
Maybe I'm oldfashioned,

689
00:46:26,947 --> 00:46:30,780
但我认为那应该和你爱的人一起做的事
But I think that means you do it with someone you love.

690
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:33,370
最好是婚后
And preferably when you're married.

691
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:38,290
当你准备好承担这份爱且寄托于子孙
You know, when you're ready to take that love and turn it into a baby.

692
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:41,750
那才是爱情的真谛
Because that's what love is.

693
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,050
当你第一刻抱着你的宝贝
It's that first moment when you hold your baby girl

694
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:50,840
你从没见过这么小而精致的东西
and you didn't know that anything could be so small or so delicate.

695
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:53,970
你能感受那微弱的心跳
And you feel that tiny heart beat

696
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,680
就知道没有比这个更让你疼爱的了
and you know that you couldn't love anything more in the whole world.

697
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:03,230
你会希望自己对这个小生命负责
And you hope that you can do right by that little girl

698
00:47:04,206 --> 00:47:06,494
当她摔倒的时候你会在她身边
And always be there to catch her when she falls,

699
00:47:06,494 --> 00:47:08,150
没有什么可以伤害到她
And that nothing ever hurts her.

700
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,860
不会摔坏胳膊
Not a broken arm

701
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:13,240
不会做恶梦
or a bad dream

702
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:17,750
也不会伤心
or a broken heart.

703
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:26,340
我不要了  拿走   我也不要了
I don't want these. just take them.  Me either.

704
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,880
真的啊
Are you serious

705
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,800
好  不错  很好
Great, fine, wonderful.

706
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:32,680
再给我点儿
More for me.

707
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,760
够我一个礼拜的了
Now I got enough for the whole weekend.

708
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,020
天啊
Oh, my god

709
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:43,980
斯坦  小伙子们  别打了
stan    boys, stop it

710
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:45,900
拉开  把他拉走  斯坦
Break it up   get off him, stan

711
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:49,690
把手机都拿开  别拍了
Put those phones away   stop it

712
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:52,360
别打了  不许打架
stop hitting him   no fighting

713
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:56,370
喜欢吗  你会再进监狱的
You like that     You're gonna go to jail again.

714
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,620
看看这个  就像他老妈一样扇他耳光
Look at that. he slapped him like a mother.

715
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:04,250
真恶心
That thing sucks.

716
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,300
真不怎么样
oh, that's wrong.

717
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:12,010
看看这个  我纽约的表哥给我发的
Yo, check this out. my cousin in new york sent it to me.

718
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:25,520
我没来晚吧
I hope I'm not late for our meeting.

719
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:28,820
因为打架要被降级  真好  谁赢了
Busted for fighting, nice. who won

720
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,990
实际上是打平了
You know, it was actually pretty even.

721
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:33,650
真的
Really

722
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,160
视频网站上看你是被爆打了一顿
On youtube it looked like you got your ass kicked.

723
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,200
我都看了好几遍了
I saw it a couple times.

724
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,040
你穿的这是什么啊
what are you wearing

725
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,540
贝克汉姆  啥
beckham.  no, what

726
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:45,250
衣服  对
Oh, the clothes. oh, right.

727
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,750
对于没受过训练的眼睛  我就像个傻逼一样
To the untrained eye, I look like a total idiot.

728
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,250
你就是  真的
You do, in fact.

729
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:53,930
实际上是诱惑的技术行为  就跟孔雀一样
Ah. but it's actually a seduction technique known as       peacocking.      

730
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:56,220
我的装备是双功能的
My outfit serves the dual function of icebreaker

731
00:48:56,221 --> 00:48:58,350
可以破冰也可以吸引关注
and attentiongetter.

732
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,270
现在进去吧
You can go in now.

733
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:03,350
看着
Watch.

734
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:11,530
你是展示自己吗
Are you peacocking

735
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:14,360
真的吗  你觉得有用吗
Really    you think that's gonna work

736
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:15,990
我觉得有
I think it just might.

737
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:29,750
是奥唐奈太太  你好吗
Is that    mrs. o'donnell   how you doing

738
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,090
你好吗
Hello, how are you

739
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:32,670
我很好  你呢
I'm good. how are you

740
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,420
还好
Good.

741
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:38,260
我该慢慢适应了
Wow. this is gonna take some getting used to.

742
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:40,180
你是内德的儿子
You're ned's son

743
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:42,600
对  内德生了我
Yeah. yeah. ned gave birth to me.

744
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:45,560
他没生了我  你知道我啥意思
Well, he didn't give birth  you know what I meant.

745
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,400
你还在做园艺
You're doing some gardening.

746
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,020
我重新修整了我的后院
I'm redoing the backyard.

747
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:53,320
想看看吗
You want to see

748
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,320
当然了  我有空
Yeah, sure. I got some time.

749
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:04,750
显然我还有好多活要干呢
Yeah. obviously, I still have a lot to do.

750
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:07,040
你可以把它放在  放在这儿
You can put that   Right here

751
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:08,500
好吧
All right.

752
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:10,840
谢谢
Thank you.

753
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,000
那么就这样了  就这样
so this is it.  this is it.

754
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:14,590
一直就是这样比较糟糕
It used to look a lot worse.

755
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:23,260
基本上  我是计划在这里放个池塘
Basically, uh, what I planned to do was to put a pond in over here

756
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,060
好  然后放上水
Okay.   and have water

757
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:28,810
两边流水
streaming in from both sides.

758
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,070
然后再放个大平台在这里
And then put a big deck right here

759
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:36,931
还有石板露台在这里
and then a flagstone patio there

760
00:50:36,932 --> 00:50:38,950
中间放上草皮
with sod in between.

761
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:40,530
肯定好看
That would be pretty.

762
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,325
上面再加上
And then to have twinkling lights

763
00:50:43,326 --> 00:50:45,950
闪闪的灯饰
above the whole thing

764
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,620
这样每天晚上就像星空似的
so that every night is a starry one.

765
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:52,630
一定棒极了  斯嘉
It's gonna be amazing, scar.

766
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:54,050
你刚叫我什么
What did you just call me

767
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:58,800
我说  肯定棒极了  你叫我斯嘉
I just said,       lt'll be amazing.        you called me       scar.      

768
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:01,680
只有我老公才那么叫我
My husband's the only one who calls me that.

769
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,390
你要帮忙吗
Could you use some help

770
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:07,390
我自愿的  又年轻又强壮
Volunteer. I'm young, I'm strong.

771
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:11,480
好吧  行
Right, got it. okay.

772
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:17,570
我知道那种酷哥钓女人的事
I realize that whole lady cougar hunting

773
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:22,160
那种姐弟恋的事
the       mothers I'd like to,       you know, whatever, thing

774
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,387
够你们这些小年轻炫耀的
is big with you guys, right

775
00:51:24,388 --> 00:51:25,660
特别是你们高中生
with you high school boys

776
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:28,410
但是咱们之间不可能
But that's not gonna happen between me and you.

777
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,960
我也没那意思啊
I didn't even mean it that way.

778
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:34,781
我倒想的更多的是商业经验
I was thinking more along the lines of business experience,

779
00:51:34,781 --> 00:51:36,170
申请大学之类的
College application.

780
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,800
但是如果你想那样的话
But if you want to go there, that's

781
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,970
我给你把铁锹把  好
so I'll just get you a shovel, then     yeah.

782
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:42,340

Okay.

783
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:31,810

我说咱们能行
I said we could do it

785
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,730
你看见斯坦的表情了吗
Did you see the look on stan's face

786
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:20,341
阿莱克斯  选拔赛怎么样了

他干的真的很棒
He did great out there.

793
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:36,370
马克  那样非常不合适
Oh, mark. that's super inappropriate.

794
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,460
干的真棒

当大家都发现你多有才的时候
When people see how talented you are,

807
00:54:20,649 --> 00:54:23,340
你会是全市有名的园艺设计师的
You'll be designing gardens all over the city.

808
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:24,840

00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,730
这是蛇舞
That is the snake.

819
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:21,480
你1岁的时候这个舞相当火爆
That was a very hot dance when you were 1.

820
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,820
教教我  不行
teach it to me.  I can't.

821
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:27,110
舞步很难的
It's a very advanced step

822
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,820
我知道你不怎么信  因为看我跳起来很轻松
which I know is hard to believe because I make it look effortless.

823
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,660
这对所有跳舞的人来说都不简单
That's the secret to all great dancers.

824
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:36,200
叫我试试
Try me.

825
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,210
你干吗要选那首歌
Why did you pick that song

826
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:44,840
我也不知道  就是  好像它让我挑的
Oh, I don't know. it just, uh, kind of spoke to me.

827
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
有意思
Hm. that's funny.

828
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:50,090
那是我跟我老公在婚礼上跳舞用的曲子
That's the song that my husband and I danced to at our wedding.

829
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:52,380
很有品位的一个男人
Hm. a man of good taste.

830
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:54,640
想让我教你怎么跳舞吗  想啊
want me to show you some dance moves     I'd love to.

831
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,100
我是在婚礼上学的
That I learned at my wedding.

832
00:55:56,260 --> 00:56:00,640
不错  对  你就咱在那儿  就那样
great.  yeah. okay, you stand here, like that.

833
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:03,270
对  就这样  我站在这里
Okay, like that, and I'll stand here.

834
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,440
不对  你就站在那里  就那儿
no, you stand right there.  right there.

835
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:10,990
好了  准备好没  右脚向后然后左脚向后
Okay, ready    so you go right foot back and then left foot back.

836
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:15,120
然后右脚快  左  右  左  右
And then quick right, left, right, left, right.

837
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,950
再右脚
And then right  oh.

838
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:21,040
不错  左  右  左  右
That was good. and left, right, left, right.

839
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:23,080
不错
That's good.

840
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:26,210
真的很不错  你学的很快
That was really good. you're picking that up pretty quickly.

841
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:28,340
你说你老公
So you mentioned your husband.

842
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:30,800
你觉不觉得你们会和好
Do you think you guys are ever going to get back together

843
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,130
不
Um, no.

844
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:35,640
干吗这么肯定
Why are you so sure

845
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:39,010
可能他会去弥补一下
Maybe there's something he could do to fix things.

846
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:42,350
我爱我老公  我在乎他
I love my husband and care about him

847
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,560
但有时候  这样并不够
but sometimes that just is not enough.

848
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:50,730
那就是他的错了
Well, he blew it.

849
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,280
跳
Jump.

850

妈  我是你的妈妈
Mom     I'm your mom.

853
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,810
我是阿莱克斯的妈妈马克
I am Alex's mom, Mark.

854
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:21,270
当然
Yeah.

855
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:24,690
你的男伴到了  什么
Your date is here.  Huh

在大门前  你的男伴  好的
The front door. your date.  Okay.

857
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:29,860
她有点紧张  这有点恐怖对不
She was nervous. it's creepy, right

858
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:31,610
有点
Little bit.

859
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:34,030
她不年轻了  就像
She's so old, it's like

860
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,860
你和你所有朋友的妈妈都跳舞吗
Dance with all your friend's moms

861
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:38,370
常有的事
Pretty much.

862
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,620
你好  斯嘉丽  你好
Oh, hi, Scarlet.  Hello.

Wow, you look amazing. here. pour vous.  Oh, thank you.

864
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,040
康乃馨  太过时了吧
Carnations. what a douche bag.

865
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:47,460
马克
Mark.

866
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,540
没  没事的  真抱歉
No, that's okay.  I'm sorry.

867
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:50,750
我是个单身父亲
I'm a single dad.

868
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:53,858
做儿子的看我约他妈妈都会有敌意
It's totally normal for sons to feel weird

869
00:57:53,859 --> 00:57:54,550
这很正常
when their moms date.

870
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:58,010
我是说  他们也是想代替爸爸保护这个家
I mean, he's stepping into dad's shoes, protecting the castle.

871
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:00,220
他不是我儿子  但   哦
He's not my son, but   Oh.

872
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:02,260
那就有点怪了
Then that's weird.

873
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:03,680
是有点  嗯
It is.  Yeah.

874
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:05,810
准备走了吗   好
Uh, do you want to go     Yeah.

875
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:07,390
我去拿外套
Let me get my coat.

876
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,400
拜托   拿着这个
Oh, come on.  Hold these, please.

877
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:10,900
这男人  你刚太没礼貌了
This guy     You're being rude.

878
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,900
你不要麦克叔叔要他
You're going from uncle Mike to this guy     Shh.

879
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:15,490
小声点  好吧
Be quiet.  Okay.

880
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:18,490
拜托 他呆头呆脑的
Do me a favor. shh.  He's a tool.

881
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:21,008
把这个给内德  叫他交给麦克
Give this to Ned, okay, to give to Mike.

882
00:58:21,009 --> 00:58:22,330
是我们的离婚协议书
it's our divorce papers.

883
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:25,750
记得提醒他27号一定要出席
And remind him that he needs to be there on the 27th.

884
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:28,250
好吗  谢谢
Okay    thank you.

885
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:54,650
你去哪呀
Where are you going

886
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:56,610
嘉米的派对
Jamie's party.

887
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:01,410
阿莱克斯
Alex

888
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,120
说真的  我不能来这  真的不行
Yeah, uh, seriously, I can't be here. I really can't be here.

889
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:08,859
你知道斯坦能对我
Do you know how many dangerous and

890
00:59:08,859 --> 00:59:10,750
做出多少危险的事情吗
Hurtful things Stan could do to me here

891
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,833
你有被人把头按到球堆里吗
You had your head shoved in a ball return

892
00:59:12,834 --> 00:59:13,790
那可不像做按摩
it's not a massage.

893
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,710
你已经是篮球队一员了  这是属于你的派对
You're on the basketball team now. okay    this is your party.

894
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:19,050
她来了
Okay, okay, there she is.

895
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:20,590
是妮可  我的天
There's Nicole. Oh, god.

896
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,430
哪个   她就在那
Which one     She's right there.

897
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,348
就是你眼前那个
You're looking at

898
00:59:23,349 --> 00:59:24,430
我这边数第三个你那边第二个
she's my 3, your 2.

899
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,600
别看了  你直视她干嘛  冷静点
Stop it. you're looking right at her.  Calm down.

900
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:29,640
抱歉  你那是什么
Sorry.  What was that

901
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:31,980
没事  打嗝而已  你没事打嗝干嘛
Nothing, it was a burp.  Why are you burping

902
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:34,650
肠胃问题  无视它吧  肠胃问题
I have tummy issues. what    get over it.  Tummy issues

903
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:36,900
她不会喜欢我的  我是个失败者
She's not going to like me. I'm a loser.

904
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:40,110
你怎么会是失败者呢  就因为斯坦说你是吗
Why are you a loser    because Stan says you're a loser

905
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:43,160
你觉得斯坦是完人吗  他根本一无是处
Do you think Stan's a winner    stan's going nowhere.

906
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:46,740
你看上哪个女孩都是她们三生有幸
Any girl in here would be lucky to have your attention.

907
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:50,330
你哪里了解女孩子们的心  我怎么会不清楚
What do you know about girls     What do I know about girls

908
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,460
我曾经和校花约过会
I used to date the most beautiful girl in school

909
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:55,540
但是我没有把握机会留住她
And I let her slip through my fingers.

910
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,670
我现在要帮助你
But I won't let that happen to you.

911
00:59:58,170 --> 00:59:59,420
没错   你说的没错
You're right.You're absolutely right.

912
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:02,260
我就径直走到她们面前介绍我自己
I'm just going to walk up to her and introduce myself.

913
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:05,680
明天在学校的时候  也许  还是作罢吧
Tomorrow at school. maybe. probably not.

914
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:07,390
快去吧
Just go.

915
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:13,940
美女们  你来了
Hey, girls.  Hey, you came.

916
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,270
你好吗  我很好
How are you     Good.

917
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,030
谢谢  有看到玛姬吗  我四处都找不到她
Thank you, um. have you seen Maggie    I've been looking everywhere.

918
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:20,690
玛姬不在这
Oh, um, Maggie's not here.

919
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:22,700
但是  有我在呢
But, um, I am.

920
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:25,490
而且我真的很高兴你来了
And I'm really, really glad you came.

921
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:29,830
这是她的生日会  抱歉  我没有给你带礼物
It's her birthday.  I didn't get you a present, I'm sorry.

922
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,830
把你包起来送给我就好了  这个
I'll just have to unwrap you.  Heh, heh. okay.

923
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:38,630
我因为身体过于柔韧被踢出了拉拉队
I was kicked off the cheerleading squad for being too flexible.

924
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:46,180
坐下  快坐下
Okay, okay. sit down. just sit down.

925
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:51,390
如果你们自己都不自重
If you girls don't respect yourselves

926
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:55,270
别人怎么会尊重你们呢
then how do you expect anyone else to respect you

927
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:56,690
对不
Right

928
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:57,900
我不需要你尊重我
Don't respect me.

929
01:00:58,070 --> 01:00:59,360
对  你别尊重我
No, don't respect me.

930
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,650
你记不住我的名字也无妨
You don't even have to remember my name.

931
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:03,900
这太放荡了  你先说的  荡妇
Wow, that's slutty.  First of all, you slut.

932
01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:06,320
是他们父亲的问题
This is some other dad's problem.

933
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:11,040
嗯  我觉得你很像我家小狗
And, um, I just want to tell you that you look like my dog.

934
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:15,710
你说什么  你的头发和我家狗的毛很像  因为
Excuse me     Your hair looks like my dog's hair.Because..

935
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:18,250
是么   不  我的意思是即亮又柔软
Oh, um   No, it's shiny and soft.

936
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:20,710
我们喂它添加了亚麻的独特狗粮
We give my dog special food. it's got flax in it.

937
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,760
哦  亚麻
Oh, flax.

938
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,590
它特别可爱  这挺好
She's a sweetheart.  That's sweet.

939
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,180
但她已经死掉了
Well, she died.

940
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:29,300
你是说我看起来像你家死掉的狗
So I look like your dead dog

941
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:32,600
我太紧张了  我一直想跟你讲话的
I'm just really nervous, and I've wanted to talk to you for so long.

942
01:01:32,770 --> 01:01:35,100
我在想什么呢     没事的  没事
What am I thinking     Don't worry about it. really.

943
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:37,560
阿莱克斯  天啊  你知道我叫什么
Alex     Oh, my god, you know my name.

944
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:38,900
你着火了
You're on fire.

945
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:42,110
真的     你真的着火了
Really     Literally, you're on fire.

946
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:43,360
什么
What

947
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:45,030
身上起火了
Literally on fire.

948
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:48,950
我晕  是真的  我要走了  再见
Whoa. okay. yeah, I'm gonna get out of here. later.

949
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:56,250
把那边的钥匙给我
Just hand me those keys right there.

钥匙一直放在那
They're in for the night.

951
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,820
如果里面也烧着了
If the keys are locked in there,

952
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:03,760
你们就都出不去了
I don't know how I'm going to get you guys out.

953
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:07,260
节约点氧气
Conserve some oxygen in there.

954
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:10,470
别瞎叫了  氧气有限
Don't scream, you have a limited amount of oxygen.

955
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:14,390
她们好漂亮  是吧     这漂亮妞还真多
They're pretty, huh    we got some pretty ladies in here.

956
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,600
你在这啊

what do you want     I just want to talk about Stan.

958
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:41,590
你为什么会和他约会  你知道的  他是个痞子
Why are you dating him    I mean, you know he is not a nice guy.

959
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:43,130
他不正常
He's crazy.

960
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:46,010
别这么说他   你根本不了解他
Hey, don't say that about Stan. you don't even know him.

961
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:49,680
哦   是的  我真的了解他  比你了解的多
Oh, but I do. I really do. I know him better than you.

962
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:52,350
我们毕业之后就要同居了
Look, we're moving in together after graduation.

963
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:54,310
斯坦考进乔治敦大学了

964

我会去维斯特伍德社区大学
And I'm going to Westwood community college

968
01:03:05,561 --> 01:03:06,990
以方便我们生活
to be closer to him.

969
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:09,530
这辈子就他了
He's my forever.

970
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:14,990
那绝对不可能发生  你说什么
There's no way in hell that's happening.  Excuse me

971
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:18,330
我说那绝对不可能发生
I said,       there's no way in hell that that is happening.      

972
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:21,920
你认为我能让你赌上你的未来吗
You think I'm gonna let you mortgage your future

973
01:03:22,130 --> 01:03:24,460
你觉得我会让你浪费掉所有的努力
You think I'll let you throw away your hard work

974
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:26,840
所有的成就
Everything that you've accomplished

975
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:29,550
就为了一个根本不在乎你的变态吗
For some psychopathic guy who doesn't care about you

976
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:33,350
我决不准  决不准你再见他
I forbid you. I forbid you to see him anymore.

977
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:36,685
好吧  你以为你是谁啊
Oh, okay   who the hell do you think you are,

978
01:03:36,686 --> 01:03:38,640
我爸爸吗     天

别想这样就走  你真是个怪胎
Don't walk away from me.  You're a freak.

980
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:42,810
玛格瑞特・萨拉・奥唐奈

防守是制胜关键

985
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:58,830
有事吗  觉得你气色不好

986
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,080
没事
Oh. no.

987
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:05,630
我只是回想上次我在这的情景
I was just thinking that the last time I was here

988
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,130
我丈夫向我求婚
my husband asked me to marry him.

989
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:12,340
这意义还真深刻
Tough to compete with that.

990
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:17,140
落后4分   把球传给高德
Down by 6, get the ball to gold.

你好  多巧啊
Oh. hi. wow, what are the odds

1012
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:19,500
这次又有何贵干
What's it going to be now

1013
01:06:19,501 --> 01:06:21,350
难不成你买了自由女神像给我
did you buy me the statue of liberty

1014
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:24,930
我想约你出去  像个成年人
I'm just going to ask you out, okay    like a grownup.

1015
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:26,600
就是两个朋友一起吃晚餐
Just two friends having dinner.

1016
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:29,067
如果事情有所发展

我会给每个学生一台笔记本
I'll buy every student a laptop.

1020
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:43,030
你不想让他们拥有笔记本吗
You would deny the children of laptops

1021
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,080
马斯特森小姐  为了孩子   好好  好吧
Miss Masterson, the children.  Okay. okay, fine, fine.

1026
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,840
好  我们开车去吃饭

1027
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:00,180
不是乘太空梭过去
We won't fly there in the space shuttle

1028
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:03,930
或者俗气无比的加长豪华车
Or drive in some gaudy, tacky limo.

1029
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:06,270
我们坐你的车好不

这边

1031
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:15,860
内德呼叫驾驶员  任务取消  取消  把车开走
Ned to driver, abort. abort, abort. move it out right now.

1032

I totally missed it. she came right up to me, I should've kissed her.

1033
01:07:21,669 --> 01:07:22,410
我却傻楞在那
And I froze.

1034
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:25,120
没事的  我再给你制造个机会
Hey, don't worry. I'll get you another chance.

1035
01:07:25,290 --> 01:07:26,870
怎么制造  你要怎么做
How    how are you going to do that

1036
01:07:32,330 --> 01:07:34,460
在我家举行庆功宴

他带我去了后场  我们
He took me behind the quad, and we

1053

我听不下去了   你不是吧

1057
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:04,340

没事的
Hey, hey, it's okay.

1059
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:13,642
当你年轻的时候
When you're young,

1060
01:09:13,643 --> 01:09:15,980
屁大点事感觉就像世界末日一般
everything feels like the end of the world.

1061
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:19,940
其实不然
It's not.

1062
01:09:20,110 --> 01:09:21,900

Right.

1063

只是个开始
It's just the beginning.

1064
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:28,660
你可能会遇到几个垃圾
You might have to meet a few more jerks

1065

但是总有一天你会遇到

待你为掌上明珠的王子
Who treats you the way

1067
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:39,340
就像太阳和你升起降落
Like the sun rises and sets with you.

1068
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:47,010
真的是这样吗
You really think so

1069
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:51,100

Don't touch the toys, okay

1084
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:03,090
我会  尽量不要让自己烧起来
Yeah, I'll, uh, try not to light myself on fire tonight.

1085
01:11:03,250 --> 01:11:06,880
我手边会准备灭火器的  哦  那就好
I'll keep a fire extinguisher handy.  Oh, good.

1086
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:11,180
要去外面坐坐吗  当然
Do you want to sit outside     Sure.

1087
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:46,960
酒不错
That's delightful.

1088
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:53,510
怎么了  有什么不对吗
What    what

1089
01:11:56,180 --> 01:11:59,730
好吧, 我承认不知怎样才能正常点  的确
Okay, I don't know how to act normal.  Clearly.

1090
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:02,283
这就是我的人生路  并非一帆风顺
It's the story of my life. I'm not smooth.

1091
01:12:02,283 --> 01:12:04,560
我只是想给你个好印象
I'm just tryig to impress you, okay

1092
01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:07,172
我不是经常来这地方吃饭的人
I'm not the kind of guy who comes to places like this.

1093
01:12:07,173 --> 01:12:08,150
我是个书呆子
I'm a dork.

1094
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,990
我是那种花1万块
The kind of guy who spends 10 grand

1095
01:12:10,150 --> 01:12:12,740
买双塔奇兵里的灰袍甘道夫魔杖的人
on gandalf the grey's quarterstaff from the two towers.

1096
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,410
是  那的确有点呆
Yes, that does make you a dork.

1097
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,670
尤其当灰袍甘道夫为了友情
Especially since gandalf the grey was only in fellowship.

1098
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:27,920
化身为白袍甘道夫重回双塔
He returns in two towers as gandalf the white.

1099
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:54,530
我那时太难过了 对不起 好吗
I was upset. I'm sorry, okay

1100
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:58,030
我要你证明你是爱我的
I need you to show me that you love me.

1101
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:00,160
那样的话我们就能真正同居了
And that way we can get a place together.

1102
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:03,460
不要说了 听着 不管过去如何 我有新男人了
Stop it. look, whatever. I'm with somebody else now.

1103
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:07,340
你说什么  游戏结束了Stan
What     party's over, Stan.

1104
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:09,630
滚出去
Just get out of here.

1105
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:17,300
谁能让我离开这里
Who's gonna make me leave

1106
01:13:18,850 --> 01:13:19,930
你吗
You

1107
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:23,980
你知道我会的  但是你满身酒味
You know I would, but it smells like you've been drinking

1108
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:27,060
所以我打算让警察来处理
So I'm just gonna let the cops do it.

1109
01:13:32,110 --> 01:13:33,740
这尼姑归你了
You can have the nun.

1110
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:36,160
她反正也不怎么样
She doesn't put out, anyway.

1111
01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:37,660
我改主意了
On second thought

1112
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:45,750
我刚做了一个最疯狂的梦
Oh, I just had the craziest dream.

1113
01:13:47,710 --> 01:13:49,670
我回到了17岁
I was 17.

1114
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:54,630
我回到高中时代  真是太可怕了
I was back in high school, and it was terrible.

1115
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,180
伤疤
Scar.

1116
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:04,770
伤疤  我没有看到伤疤
Scar    I don't see a scar.

1117
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:08,190
听着  我知道你为何不想我和斯坦在一起
Look, I know why you didn't want me to be with Stan.

1118
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,980
因为你喜欢我
It's because you wanted me.

1119
01:14:14,070 --> 01:14:16,820
你想玩游戏吗  那我就陪你玩
You want to play games    I can play games.

1120
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:19,410
不不不  我是只饥渴的母狮子
no, no, no.  I'm a hungry lioness

1121
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,370
你是只小羚羊
And you're a baby gazelle.

1122
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,200
玛姬  不 不要这样  停手
Maggie   no, no, no, maggie, stop this now.

1123
01:14:25,370 --> 01:14:28,830
你要知道这样的行为有多么不适当吗
If you only knew how highly inappropriate and dysfunctional this is.

1124
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:30,540
住手  拜托你停下来
Stop it. please stop.

1125
01:14:30,710 --> 01:14:33,380
玛姬  我不是你想的那种人
Maggie, I'm not the person that you think I am.

1126
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:35,130
不对  你是  不  我不是
yes, you are.  no, I'm not.

1127
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:37,930
是的  你是好人  和他们不一样
You're right, you're good. you're not like the others.

1128
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:40,760
我和他们不一样  我和他们有很大区别
I'm not like others. I'm very different than the others.

1129
01:14:40,930 --> 01:14:43,956
很大区别  事实上  你和我从来没有  永远  永远
So different, in fact, that you and I can never, ever, ever,

1130
01:14:43,956 --> 01:14:44,930
永远不能在一起
Ever be together.

1131
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:46,930
别咬了  为什么
stop biting.  why

1132
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:55,780
哦  我的天哪  你在说什么
Oh, my god. what are you saying

1133
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:57,400
你很困惑吗
Are you confused

1134
01:14:58,030 --> 01:15:00,490
我相当困惑  是的  超级困惑
I'm very confused, yes. extremely confused.

Oh, my god. i  i  I get it now.

1136
01:15:05,410 --> 01:15:10,080
你的头发已经很整齐了  你还要弄得更显眼
And your hair is always perfectly coiffed, and you have highlights.

1137
01:15:11,670 --> 01:15:14,380
你在说什么     我是说
what are you talking about     I mean

1138
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:17,920
伙计  你的牛仔裤太瘦了
Dude, your jeans are really tight.

1139

I've been in love with the same girl since I was 17, Maggie.

1143

给我两分钟时间让我解释清楚

Well, this isn't exactly the inconspicuous relationship I wanted.

1203
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:46,860
你现在知道我为什么不约学生家长了吧
I'm sure now you can see why I don't date my students' parents.

但是我们有了很大的进展
But we've made very good progress.

1216
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:47,750
我们得休息一下了
We deserve a break.

1217
01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:50,460
我失去了我的家人
I lost my family.

1218
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:52,930
麦克
Hey, Mike

01:20:53,130 --> 01:20:54,780
如果这算安慰的话
If it's any consolation,

1220
01:20:54,781 --> 01:20:56,760
我想你真的帮到了你的孩子
I think you really did help your kids.

1221

你已经尽职了  现在英雄可以继续向前了
You did your job, and now the hero can move on.

1222
01:21:00,810 --> 01:21:02,600
我不想
I don't want to.

1223
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:06,270
也许他们不再需要我了  但是我需要他们
Maybe they don't need me anymore, but I need them.

1224
01:21:08,150 --> 01:21:10,110
我不想惹你烦
Hey, not to be a buzzkill

1225
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:11,860
但是你应该去法庭了
but you're due in court

1226
01:21:12,610 --> 01:21:14,280
在22分钟内
in 22 minutes.

1227
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:17,240
内德  我需要些时间

我必须阻止这一切  去开车

快点  格兰
Come on, Glenn

1232
01:21:38,930 --> 01:21:41,180
他就是个名字动听爱争吵的侏儒
He's nothing but a glorified midget wrangler.

1233
01:21:41,470 --> 01:21:43,640
要不是穿那个背心也不会变得如此高大
You wouldn't be so big without that vest

1234
01:21:43,810 --> 01:21:47,350
拿好下面那个东西  抓好了  拉起来
Grab that thing that's down there. grab it. just hold that up.

1235
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,440
你从哪弄到的     最多20美分
where you get this     best 20 ever spent.

1236
01:21:49,610 --> 01:21:51,480
节省了我半个小时的路程
Saves me a half hour on my commute.

1237
01:21:51,650 --> 01:21:53,990
老兄  举起来  把它举起来
Dude, just hold it. hold it way up.

1238
01:22:12,210 --> 01:22:14,880
所有的真相  你能像上帝发誓都是事实吗
the whole truth, but the truth, so help you god

1239
01:22:15,050 --> 01:22:16,340
我能
I do.

1240
01:22:16,510 --> 01:22:18,840
你在加州提起一起离婚诉讼
You request a divorce by the state of california

1241
01:22:19,010 --> 01:22:21,350
以性格不合为理由  是吗

是的  法官大人  麦克尔・奥唐奈在场吗
yes, your honor.  is Michael o'donnell present

1243
01:22:25,770 --> 01:22:26,810
不  法官大人
No, your honor.

1244
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:30,020
我将他的缺席视为同意离婚
I take his absence as agreement to the orders of the divorce.

1245
01:22:34,530 --> 01:22:37,700
你没有申请单方监护吗     没有  法官大人
you are not requesting sole custody     no, your honor.

1246
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:40,280
      你不能歪曲事实      
      you can't handle the truth        

1247
01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:42,620
什么
What

1248
01:22:42,790 --> 01:22:44,325
抱歉  我太着急了
I'm sorry, I panicked.

1249
01:22:44,326 --> 01:22:46,000
这是我脑袋冒出的第一句话
it was the first thing that came into my mind.

1250
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:48,790
法官大人

你是律师  好朋友
You a lawyer, best friend

1253
01:22:55,050 --> 01:22:56,550
是的  不
yes.  no.

1254
01:22:56,720 --> 01:23:00,050
我相信我口袋里的东西会让法官信服的
I believe the law degree in my pocket says so.

1255
01:23:00,220 --> 01:23:01,720
是的  他有点脏
Yes, and it's a little bit smeared

1256
01:23:01,721 --> 01:23:04,720
因为我在车里的时候坐在上面
because I sat on it in the car

1257
01:23:04,890 --> 01:23:08,190
并不是因为我刚打印出来
not because I printed it out recently.

1258
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:14,150
就算这是真的  你要解释你想做什么吗
Let's pretend that's real. want to explain what you're doing

1259
01:23:15,030 --> 01:23:16,530

01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:29,040
好的  如果你让我解释  我能解释这一切
Okay, if you'd just let me explain. I can explain this.

1264
01:23:29,210 --> 01:23:30,580
你过你可以听
If you would just listen

1265
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:33,111
我这有封麦克・奥唐奈的信

1267
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,300
对不起  我们正在

Your honor, if it's okay, I'd like to hear the letter, please.

他希望我来读

1272
01:23:59,650 --> 01:24:01,200
斯嘉丽
      Scarlet

1273
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:05,240
在你进行官司之前
before you go through with this

1274
01:24:05,410 --> 01:24:09,710
我希望您能回忆一下1988年9月7日那天
i want to remind you of september 7th, 1988.

1275
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,920
那是我第一次见到你
It was the first time that I saw you.

1276
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:18,550
你正在读《比零还少》
You were reading less than zero.

1277
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:22,930
你穿着枪炮玫瑰乐队的T恤
You were wearing a guns n' roses tshirt.

1278
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:27,970
我从没见过这么完美的事物
I'd never seen anything so perfect.

1279
01:24:31,770 --> 01:24:34,940
我记得我想的是要么和你在一起  要么去死
I remember thinking that I had to have you, or I'd die.

1280
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:39,990
然后你悄悄对我说你爱上了我
Then you whispered that you loved me

1281
01:24:43,030 --> 01:24:44,990
在归国舞会上
at the homecoming dance.

1282
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:50,160
然后我感觉
And I felt

1283
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,750
那么平静
so peaceful

1284
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:56,460
那么安全
and safe.

1285
01:24:58,630 --> 01:25:01,720
因为我知道从那天起不管发生了什么
Because I knew that no matter what happeNed from that day on

1286
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:04,380
都不会太糟糕
nothing could ever be that bad.

1287
01:25:05,180 --> 01:25:06,970
因为我有你
Because I had you.

1288
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:12,560
然后我一步步成长
And then I grew up

1289
01:25:14,190 --> 01:25:16,020
我迷失了方向
and I lost my way.

1290
01:25:19,070 --> 01:25:21,610
因为我自己的错而责怪你
And I blamed you for my failures.

1291
01:25:25,950 --> 01:25:29,030
我知道你今天这么做是逼不得已
And I know that you think you have to do this today.

1292
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,870
我并不想让你这么做
I don't want you to.

1293
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,380
但是我想
But I guess

1294
01:25:43,050 --> 01:25:44,720
如果我还爱你
if I love you

1295
01:25:48,350 --> 01:25:50,510
我就应该让你有新的生活      
i should let you move on.      

1296
01:25:54,730 --> 01:25:56,350
好了  孩子  你可以走了
All right, son, you need to go now.

1297
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:20,380
我们继续
Let's proceed.

1298
01:26:23,090 --> 01:26:25,260
对不起  法官大人  请问
I'm sorry, your honor. would it be okay

1299
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:28,390
我是否可以将这个案子延期一段时间
if we postpone this for now for just a little while

1300
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:30,220
可以吗

自从毕业后
Haven't seen you

1303
01:27:00,273 --> 01:27:01,960
就从来没看你这么努力的训练过
practice this hard since school.

1304
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:03,319
是的  你知道
Yeah, you know,

1305
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:05,170
如果我想让那些校园侦探记住我
if I want to impress these college scouts

1306
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:07,760
我必须专心训练
then I need to stay focused.

1307
01:27:07,930 --> 01:27:11,430
等等  你不是还想拿奖学金吧  是吗
Wait, wait. you're not still trying to get a scholarship, are you

1308
01:27:12,010 --> 01:27:15,970
当心  伙计  你不是想放弃精神之路吧
Be careful, man. you do not want to get off of the spirit path.

1309
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:20,600
根本没路  内德  根本没有路  我做不到
There's no path, Ned   there's no path   I can't do it

1310
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:22,520
我只能让事情变得更糟
I just made it worse for them.

1311
01:27:22,690 --> 01:27:24,290
我妻子很开心
My wife is happier,

1312
01:27:24,291 --> 01:27:27,490
我的消失让所有人都很开心  内德

1313
