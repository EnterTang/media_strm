186
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,704
-小姐？ -失陪 - Stewardess? - Excuse me.

187

188
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:31,390
身材又好 And a darling figure.

189
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:36,033
肌肤充满弹性，丰乳纤腿 Supple, pouting breasts, firm thighs.

190
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,696
可惜你俩合不来 lt's a shame you two don't get along.

191
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,134
我知道 Yes, l know.

192
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,934
以前并不是这样的 Things used to be different.

193
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,976
我记得我们首次相遇的情形 l remember when we first met.

194
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,844
是战时的事 lt was during the war.

195
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,887
我加入空军 驻守巴巴利海岸的杜林比 l was in the air force, stationed in Drambuie, off the Barbary Coast.

196
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,523
经常往马金巴酒吧 l used to hang out at the Magumba Bar,

197
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,958
那是一处品流复杂的地方 lt was a rough place, The seediest dive on the wharf,

198
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:10,794
三山五[的人都聚集在那儿 populated with every reject and cut-throat from Bombay to Calcutta,

199
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,368
比底特律还要差 lt was worse than Detroit,

200
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,376
那儿的气氛也不好 The mood in the place was ugly,

201
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,416
拳头要够硬才可以往那里 You wouldn't be there unless you knew how to use your fists,

202
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,418
几乎每晚都会发生打斗 Afight broke out almost every night,

203
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:47,156
我并非往那里找情人 只想喝几杯 l didn't go there that night to fall in love, l just wanted a couple of drinks,

204
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,264
突然之间，我看到她 And suddenly, there she was,

205
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:03,037
我完全被她俘虏，像遭电击 l was captivated, entranced, lt hit me like a thunderboit,

206
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:07,343
我得叫这厮捏我 以确保自己不是在做梦 l had to ask this guy to pinch me to make sure l wasn't dreaming,

207
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,085
我害怕上前认识她 l was afraid to approach her,

208
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,987
但那晚，我们注定相识 but that night, fate was on my side,

209
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:27,650
我们谈天、说笑和跳舞 We laughed, we talked, we danced,

210
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,481
我不想那晚结束，现在亦然 l never wanted it to end. l guess l still don't.

211
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:35,557
我说够了，希望没把你闷坏 Enough about me. l hope this hasn't been boring for you.

212
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:40,662
但每当说起绮莲，我都很投入 浑然忘记了时间 But whenever l talk about Elaine, l get so carried away. l lose all track of time.

213
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,966
想要晚餐吗？ Would you like to order dinner?

214
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:49,537
-祖儿吃牛扒，我们则吃鱼 -我何时可以参观驾驶舱？ - Joey will have steak. We'll have fish. - When can l see the cockpit?

215
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:53,573
机师现在很忙 The pilots are probably too busy flying the plane for that.

216
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:55,040
真气人！ Aw, gee whizz!

217
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,114
我跟机长说，且看能否安排 l'll talk to the captain and see what l can arrange.

218
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:01,579
太好了！ Gee, that'd be swell!

219
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,348
想吃晚餐吗？ Would you care to order your dinners?

220
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,954

225
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,979
-坐吧 -谢谢 - Won't you sit down? - Thank you.

226
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:43,092
-加奶吗？ -不，我喝黑咖啡的 - Cream? - No, l take it black.

227
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,521
像我的男人一样 Like my men.

228
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:57,896
泰德，我实在太快乐了 Ted, l never knew l could be so happy.

229
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:01,435
这几个月简直是神仙生活 These past few months have been wonderful.

230
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:05,438
不如明天我们去吃海鲜 Tomorrow, why don't we drive to that little seafood place and...

231
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:10,814
-怎么了？ -我接到命令 - What's the matter? - My orders came through.

232
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,744
我的部队要明天出发 My squadron ships out tomorrow.

233
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:16,385
我们要在六点钟 轰炸戴基利的补给站 We're bombing the storage depots at Daiquiri at 1800 hours.

234
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:19,386
我们由北面进袭 低于他们的雷达 We're coming in from the north, below their radar.

235
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:24,095
-你何时回来？ -我不能说，是机密 - When will you be back?. - l can't tell you that. lt's classified.

236
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:28,931
泰德，万事小心，我很担心 Oh, Ted, please be careful. l worry about you so much.

237
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:31,529

抱歉，你认错人了 Sorry, you have me confused with someone else.

258
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:06,357
我叫梅罗渣，是副机师 My name's Roger Murdock. l'm the co-pilot.

259
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:11,227

我觉得你是最出色的球员 l think you're the greatest,

265
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:32,048
但爸说你在防守方面做得不够 but my dad says you don't work hard enough on defence.

266
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:35,918
他经常说你甚至不回防 And he says lots of times you don't even run downcourt.

267
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:39,254
在季后赛时才偶尔回防 And you don't try, except during the play-offs.

268
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:41,226
我有回防的！ The hell l don't!

269
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:46,796
自从我在大学开始 已不断听到这种废话 Listen, kid, l've been hearing that crap ever since l was at UCLA.

270

要他们上落跑48分钟吧 up and down the court for 48 minutes.

273
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:05,520
祖儿 喜欢关于格斗者电影吗？ Joey... Do you like movies about gladiators?

274
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:14,165
绮莲，请听我说 Elaine, just hear me out.

277
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:22,873
我记得一切 l remember everything.

278
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:26,974
我只有回忆 All l have is memories.

279
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:30,442
记得最深刻的是晚上一起时 Mostly, l remember the nights we were together.

280
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:33,980
我记得你怎样拥抱我 l remember how you used to hold me,

281
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:37,346
我怎样坐在你的面上摆动 how l used to sit on your face and wriggle, and...

282
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:41,116
然后我们会一起看日出 afterwards, how we'd watch till the sun came up.

283
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:44,691
当太阳升起时 When it did, it was almost like...

284
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:49,059
就像那新的一天是为我们而设 like each new day was created only for us.

285
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,996
我一直就想这样 That's the way l've always wanted it to be.

286
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,862
可惜事与愿违 But it won't be.

287
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:57,336
你一直活在过去！ Not as long as you insist on living in the past!

288
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,913
泰德，你飞得太低了！ You're too low, Ted!

289
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:19,055
（美军精神病院有茂醇）

290
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,792
你的脑袋又愚弄你了 The mind plays tricks on you.

291
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:28,400
他今天看来很高兴吧 He looks so happy today, doesn't he?

292
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:31,335
你今天看来很高兴 You look so happy today.

293
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:35,910
罗拔，放他们下来，不痛的 OK, Robert, slip them down. This won't hurt much.

294
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,774
总部今天有电报给你 You got a telegram from headquarters today.

295
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:40,382
总部？什么来的？ Headquarters? What is it?

296
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:44,612
即将军聚首的巨型建筑物 算了 A big building where generals meet, but that's not important.

297
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:47,357
那次突击的事，他们不怪责你 They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid.

298
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:50,618
-这岂非好消息？ -是吗？ - lsn't that good news? - ls it?

299
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:55,924
由于我的过失，有六人死亡 Because of my mistake, six men didn't return from that raid.

300
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:58,726
是七个，薛中尉今早逝世 Seven. Lieutenant Zip died this morning.

301
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:03,668
但沉医生说你一周后可以出院 这不是好消息吗？ But Dr Sandler says you'll be out in a week. lsn't that wonderful?

302
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,778
但愿我能这样跟薛佐治说 l wish l could say the same for George Zip.

303
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:12,811
耐心一点吧！ 没有人预期你会立即忘记此事 Be patient, Ted. Nobody expects you to get over this immediately.

304
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:16,212
史，可否歇一歇？我很累 Hey, Striker, how about a break?. l'm getting tired.

305
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:19,084
好的，休息五分钟吧 Yeah, all right. Take five.

306
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,290
谢谢你 Thanks.

307
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:27,988
我为我们找到新房子 有砖造的火炉 l found a wonderful apartment for us. lt has a brick fireplace

308
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:32,032
睡房也很特别，天花板有镜子 and a cute bedroom with mirrors on the ceiling and...

309
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:34,363
红队长，我要下去了！ Red Leader, l'm going down!

310
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:38,973
姬上尉以为自己是机师 仍在打仗 Captain Geline. He thinks he's a pilot, still fighting the war.

311
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:43,374
我找到隧道了，这边 l've found the tunnel, Johnson! lt's this way!

312
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:46,310
二十五元一根烟太贵了！ $25 for a cigarette is too much!

313
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:53,418
-他怎么了？ -他是胡中尉 - What's his problem? - lt's Lieutenant Hurwitz.

314
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:57,355
严重弹震症 以为自己是雄性人鱼 Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.

315
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,540
战争实在可怕 War is hell.

316
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:27,591
先生，吃晚餐前想喝杯咖啡吗 Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before dinner?

317
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,850
不用了，谢谢 No. No, thank you.

318
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:35,430
-要多一杯吗？ -好的，但占不要了 - Would you like another cup? - l will, but Jim won't.

319
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,533
我想要多杯咖啡 l think l will have another cup of coffee.

320
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:43,163
占在家从来不会多要一杯咖啡 Jim never has a second cup of coffee at home,

321
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:51,738
-修女 -什么事？ - Excuse me, Sister. - Yes?

随便 l think that'd be nice.

328
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:24,344
-你好，我叫兰迪 -我是莉莎，你有结他 - Hi, l'm Randy. - l'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!

329

330
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,253
好！ l'd love to.

331
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:33,423
让我想想 OK. Let's see...

332
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:36,183
这是我最喜欢的 This is one of my favorites.

333
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,472
你迟到，我们在等你 You're late. We've been waiting.

334
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:06,775
-谁先？ -你来吧！家伦 - Who's first? - Go ahead, Clarence.

335
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:08,677
天气怎样？ How's the weather?

336
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:13,219
前面有厚云层，要上升飞行 We got some heavy stuff ahead of us. We've got to climb on top.

337
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:20,189
战后我想尽量离开伤心地 Yeah, after the war, l wanted to get as far away as possible,

338
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:23,457
故我和绮莲加入和平大使计划 so Elaine and l joined the Peace Corps.

339
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:26,966
我们被派往接触偏远部族 莫林保人 We were assigned to an isolated tribe, the Molombos.

340
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:31,066
他们从没见过美国人 They'd never seen Americans before.

341
00:33:44,823 --> 00:33:49,385
向他们介绍西方文化 是一个大挑战 lt was really a challenge, introducing them to our Western cuiture,

342
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:56,399
起初，他们对我们有戒心 At first, they didn't know what to think of us,

343
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:58,966
但很快我们获得他们信任 But soon, we gained their trust,

344
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:11,115
这样保存食物更好 lt'll help you better prepare storing foods

345
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:14,615
可保留至季候风月份 for the up and coming monsoon months.

346
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:19,583
这些用来存放吃剩的东西最好 Also, Supperware products are ideal for storing leftovers

347
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:22,725
价廉物美 to help stretch your food dollar.

348
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:26,428
这个保鲜盒 This two-quart ''Seals-M-Rite'' container

349
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:29,497
可以令热狗包保持新鲜多天 keeps hot dog buns fresh for days.

350
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:33,965
这些人一直与文明隔绝 These people had been completely isolated from civilization,

351
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,573
从没有人替他们制订保健计划 No one had outlined a physical fitness program for them,

352
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:39,741
他们亦没有运动器材 and they had no athletic equipment,

353
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:43,674
我教他们做柔软体操 和一些基本球技 l started them on simple calisthenics, worked up to rudimentary game skills,

354
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,713
最后令他们有竞赛能力 and finally, advanced competitive theory,

355
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:50,051
我很有耐性，他们亦很好学 l was patient, and they were eager to learn,

356
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:52,550
他们似乎玩得很开心 They seemed to enjoy themselves,

357
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:55,292
大概因为有先进的美国教法 Probably due to advanced American teaching techniques,

358
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:58,051
他们再不与世隔绝 we bridged the generations of isolation,

359
00:34:58,363 --> 00:35:01,594
我们成功与莫林保人沟通 and communicated successfully with the Molombos,

360
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:11,635
他们已把握到个中精髓 再来时，我会教他们打棒球 They're getting the hang of it. When we re-enlist, l'll teach them baseball.

361
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,707
泰德，我不想留在这里 Ted, l don't want to stay here.

362
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:19,074
该回家实行战前定下的计划 lt's time to go home to the plans we made before the war.

363
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:25,253
很多人在战前都有很多计划 薛佐治就是其中一分子 A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zip.

364
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:35,294
那刻我知道绮莲对我们的 关系有疑问 At that moment, l realised Elaine had doubts about our relationship,

365
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,001
这引起我的饮水问题 And that, as much as anything else, led to my drinking problem,

366
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:44,697
我们返美，我做过很多工作 We did come back to the States. l tried a number of jobs.

367
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:48,172
我可以继续说，但你会闷坏 l could go on, but l'd probably bore you.

368
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:51,041
实在不能怪责绮莲 她想有自己的事业 l really couldn't blame Elaine. She wanted a career.

369
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:00,747
-我受不了 -什么事？ - l can't stand it. - What is it?

370
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:02,959
-什么事？ -我的胃很不舒服 - Yes? - lt's my stomach.

371
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:07,364
自从看过列根那电影后 我从没试过那么不舒服 l haven't felt this awful since we saw that Ronald Reagan film.

372
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:11,293
且看我能否找到晕机药 l'll see if l can find some Dramamine.

373
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,505
机长，有一名女乘客很不舒服 Captain, a woman passenger is very sick.

374
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:25,914
-晕机？ -不是，她真的很辛苦 - Airsick?. - l think so, l've never seen it so acute,

375
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:31,384
悄悄地找找机上有没有医生 Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.

376
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:38,952
祖儿，你到过土耳其监狱吗？ Joey, have you ever been in a Turkish prison?

377
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:44,368
我不该喝第二杯咖啡 l shouldn't have had that second cup of coffee.

378
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,148
占在家从不呕吐 Jim never vomits at home,

379
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:03,510
抱歉弄醒你，但我想找医生 Sorry to wake you. l'm looking for a doctor. There's nothing to worry about.

380
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:07,554
小姐，我身旁的该是医生 Stewardess, l think the man next to me is a doctor.

381
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:11,625
先生，抱歉弄醒你 但你是医生吗？ Sir, excuse me. Sorry to wake you, are you a doctor?

382
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,660
-是的 -我们有乘客不舒服 - That's right. - We have sick passengers.

383

-可否去看看他们？ -好的 - Could you take a look at them? - Yes, of course.

384

00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:02,408
我很快回来 l'll be back in a minute.

386
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:11,579
叫机长降落，要送她往医院 Tell the captain to land. She must go to a hospital.

387
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,584
医院！什么？ A hospital! What is it?

388
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:16,486
是一座有病人的建筑物，算了 lt's a big building with patients, but that's not important.

389
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:19,491
-我得跟机长谈谈 -好的 - l must speak to the captain. - Certainly.

390
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:28,729
伟达，我们遇上浓… Victor, we're running into heavy...

391
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:31,238
罗渣，快接手！ Roger, take over!

你要在两小时后才去猜一猜？ You can't take a guess for another two hours?

396
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:11,848
我们无法降落，太大雾了 No, we can't land. Fog has closed down everything.

397
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:14,244
我们得尽快降落 We've got to get through to Chicago.

398
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:24,258
带他走 Get him out of there!

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,318
-医生，究竟发生什么事？ -我不清楚 - What is it, Doctor? What's going on? - l'm not sure.

400
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:56,082

404

医生，又有两人不舒服 乘客都很担心 Doctor, two more are sick. The other passengers are worried.

405
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:12,733

407
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:21,385

跟着我们会飞越大峡谷 and later we'll pass south of the Grand Canyon,

与此同时，请放松 好好享受今次旅程 Meanwhile, relax and enjoy your flight, OK?

否则我不知道能否救他们 l can't be sure of saving their lives.

478
00:46:04,408 --> 00:46:07,866
机上有没有人可以令飞机降落 ls there anyone on board who can land this plane?

还以为有人会听你说 You'd think someone would listen to you.

503

机场管理层、飞管局 和航空公司… Well, airport management, the FAA, and the airlines...

504
00:48:28,786 --> 00:48:30,651
他们都是骗子 they're all cheats and liars.

505
00:48:30,955 --> 00:48:33,321
好，走吧 All right. Let's get out of here.

506

抱歉，我想找懂驾驶飞机的人 l'm sorry, l was just looking for someone with flying experience.

507
00:48:45,503 --> 00:48:48,597
他们筑路时，没考虑去水问题 When they built those roads, they didn't think about drainage,

508
00:48:48,873 --> 00:48:53,606
故我们要乘特制吉普车往大路 so we had to take a special jeep up to the main road.

509
00:48:53,878 --> 00:48:57,609
很幸运我们找来吉普车 We were lucky to get a jeep, since, just the day before,

驾驶舱？什么？ The cockpit? What is it?

513
00:49:06,824 --> 00:49:10,351
即机师坐的小房子，算了 The little room where the pilot sits. That's not important.

514
00:49:10,594 --> 00:49:15,122
副机师病倒了 机长想找人帮忙 The first officer is ill. The captain needs someone to help him with the radio.

523
00:50:05,483 --> 00:50:10,113

524
00:50:11,155 --> 00:50:13,521
是截然不同的飞行经验 lt's an entirely different kind of flying.

525

我已有六年没接触任何飞机 l haven't touched any kind of plane in six years.

526

但我知道你是飞机上 唯一可能驾驶它的人 But l do know that you're the only one on this plane who can possibly fly it.

528
00:50:28,105 --> 00:50:29,970
你是我们唯一的希望 You're the only chance we've got.

529

祈力斯呢？ Where the hell is Kramer?

538
00:51:49,386 --> 00:51:53,220
不，他做不来，起火机会太大 No, he can't do that. The risk of a flame-out's too great.

539
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:56,516
要他保持在二万四千英尺高 Keep him at 24,000... No, feet.

540
00:52:00,431 --> 00:52:02,490

544
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:23,809
史泰德是个不济飞行小组队长 Ted Striker was a crack flight leader, up to a point.

545
00:52:24,121 --> 00:52:28,922
他是那种…太感性的人 He was one of those men who... felt too much inside.

546
00:52:29,159 --> 00:52:31,024
或许你也认识那种人 Maybe you know that kind.

547
00:52:31,328 --> 00:52:34,661
有一次任务，他一败涂地 He went all to pieces on a particular mission.

548
00:52:35,432 --> 00:52:38,128
希望今晚不会这样 Let's just hope that doesn't happen tonight.

549
00:52:45,709 --> 00:52:49,770
让我看看…高度，二万四千英尺 Let's see... Altitude, 24,000 feet.

550
00:52:50,848 --> 00:52:54,477
保持这高度，速度520哩 Level flight. Speed, 520 knots.

551
00:52:55,286 --> 00:52:57,413
航道090 Course Zero Niner Zero.

552
00:52:57,655 --> 00:53:01,318
切条、搅均 洗净、冲水、摇干 Trim, mixture. Wash, soap, rinse, spin.

553
00:53:04,928 --> 00:53:09,058
泰德，你在此做什么？ 你不能驾驶这飞机！ Ted! What are you doing here? You can't fly this plane!

554
00:53:09,366 --> 00:53:11,334
我正努力告诉他们这一点 That's what l'm trying to tell them.

555
00:53:11,602 --> 00:53:15,800
绮莲，我没时间转弯抹角 得直接对你说 Elaine. l don't have time to be gentle, so l'll be very direct.

556
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:18,600
大家的情况都很危险 Everyone is in a desperate situation.

557
00:53:18,909 --> 00:53:21,377
史先生是我们唯一的希望 Mr Striker is the only hope we got.

558
00:53:26,183 --> 00:53:29,346
那些是襟翼，这是推力 Those are the flaps. This is the thrust.

559
00:53:30,754 --> 00:53:33,348
这会亮起降落灯 This must turn on the landing lights.

560
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:43,989
（返回座位）

561
00:53:47,304 --> 00:53:51,365
-救命！… -五月？怎么了？ - Mayday! Mayday! - Mayday?. What the hell is that?

562
00:53:51,642 --> 00:53:55,043
五月是俄罗斯的新年 我们有大巡游 May Day's the Russian new year. We'll have a big parade and serve...

563
00:54:06,256 --> 00:54:08,622
我不能再忍受了 l can't stand it any more.

564
00:54:08,826 --> 00:54:11,317
我要出去！ l've got to get out of here!

565
00:54:11,595 --> 00:54:15,793
-冷静！控制自己 -让我来吧 - Calm down! Get ahold of yourself! - Please let me handle this.

566
00:54:18,302 --> 00:54:21,533

567
00:54:21,805 --> 00:54:23,670
冷静，控制自己 Calm down. Get ahold of yourself.

568
00:54:23,941 --> 00:54:26,171
医生，有人找你 Doctor, you're wanted on the phone.

569
00:54:26,443 --> 00:54:31,437
-一切会没事的 -修女，让我来 - Everything will be all right. - Sister, l can handle this.

570
00:54:31,715 --> 00:54:33,842
走开！ Got to get out of here!

571
00:54:37,454 --> 00:54:39,854
我们想你收下这朵花 We'd like you to have this flower.

572
00:54:41,658 --> 00:54:43,785
先生，你可否… Excuse me, sir, would you...

573
00:54:44,094 --> 00:54:46,358

-科学教派？ -为核能？ - Scientology?. - For nuclear power?

579
00:55:04,581 --> 00:55:06,310
（自助行李提取）

580
00:55:06,583 --> 00:55:10,952
各位注意，乘客正在抵达 Your attention, please, No-frills passengers now arriving,

581
00:55:11,255 --> 00:55:14,691
请在离开机场前 Please have your baggage claim checks ready to show

582
00:55:14,892 --> 00:55:17,019
提取及检查行李 upon leaving the terminal,

583
00:55:17,327 --> 00:55:20,160
他没有驾驶航机经验 This guy has no airline experience.

584
00:55:20,431 --> 00:55:24,731
他在空中对一切构成危险 包括雀鸟在内 He's a menace to everything in the air. Yes, birds, too.

585
00:55:24,968 --> 00:55:28,267
他是一大危机 但我们别无他选 OK, he's a terrible risk, but what other choice have we got?

586
00:55:28,572 --> 00:55:31,769
我们所知的就这么多 That's the whole story, Rex. Everything we know.

587
00:55:32,876 --> 00:55:37,813
告诉你，我曾在战时与史合作 Let's face a few facts. l flew with Striker during the war.

588
00:55:38,115 --> 00:55:41,949
当事情不顺利，他就方英寸大乱 He can't afford to worry about those times when... things weren't so good.

589
00:55:42,252 --> 00:55:45,847
-现在事情亦不顺利 -让我告诉你 - Right now things aren't so good. - Let me tell you something.

590
00:55:46,123 --> 00:55:49,581
史泰德很久之前 是空军部队队长 Striker was a top-notch squadron leader long ago.

591
00:55:49,793 --> 00:55:53,593
去说服他吧！ Get on the horn and talk that guy down.

592
00:55:53,864 --> 00:55:56,924
让他有信心驾驶飞机 Let him get the feel of that airplane,

593
00:55:57,234 --> 00:56:01,068
然后令他安全着陆吧！ then you'll have to talk him right down to the ground.

594
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:07,670
-好，联络史泰德吧！ -用我的无线电 - Very well. Put Striker on the speaker. - Use my radio.

595
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,240
我不该选这星期戒酒 l picked the wrong week to quit drinking.

596
00:56:14,885 --> 00:56:17,877
上尉，你由此直接跟他们说吧 You can work them direct from here, Captain.

597
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:25,053
史泰德，我是祈力斯上尉 Striker? Striker, this is Captain Rex Kramer speaking.

598
00:56:28,532 --> 00:56:32,059
我听到，祈上尉 Yes, Captain Kramer. Read you loud and clear.

599
00:56:35,506 --> 00:56:38,600
很好，你仍记得我 All right. lt's obvious you remember me.

600
00:56:38,876 --> 00:56:42,403
不如我们忘记一切，放眼现在 What do you say we forget about everything, except what we must do?

601
00:56:43,413 --> 00:56:45,347
少来这套了 Let's not kid each other, Kramer.

602
00:56:45,616 --> 00:56:49,780
你也知我从没驾驶过这种飞机 一切唯有靠运气 You know l've never flown a bucket like this. l'll need all the luck there is.

603
00:56:50,053 --> 00:56:52,385
准备好，史泰德 Stand by, Striker.

604
00:56:52,656 --> 00:56:57,423
我们要令他有自信 觉得自己可以胜任 Our one hope is to build this man up. l've got to give him confidence.

605
00:56:57,661 --> 00:57:02,064
-驾驶过多引擎飞机吗？ -从来没有 - You ever flown a multi-engine plane? - No, never,

606
00:57:02,366 --> 00:57:04,800
岂有此理！这简直浪费时间 Shit! lt's a goddamn waste of time.

607
00:57:05,035 --> 00:57:09,267
-他没可能令飞机降落 -你得说服他！ - There's no way he can land it! - You got to talk him down!

608
00:57:09,573 --> 00:57:12,633
叫他飞往密芝根 这样不会连累无辜 Route him into Lake Michigan, At least avoid killing innocent people,

609
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:15,435
你是他们唯一的希望 You're the only chance they've got.

610
00:57:18,282 --> 00:57:20,443
好吧 All right.

611
00:57:20,717 --> 00:57:23,686
史，你好好听着 Striker, you listen, and you listen close.

612
00:57:24,821 --> 00:57:26,686
驾驶飞机就像骑单车一样 Flying a plane is like riding a bicycle.

613
00:57:27,491 --> 00:57:32,451
只不过是较复杂一些 你得掌握个中窍门 lt'sjust harder to put baseball cards in the spokes, Get the feel of the plane,

614
00:57:32,729 --> 00:57:35,527
稍后我们会教你着陆程序 Later, we'll run down the landing procedure.

615
00:57:40,304 --> 00:57:43,296
好，先拆去自动机师 All right. Disengage the automatic pilot.

616
00:57:43,574 --> 00:57:47,066
就像你驾驶战机时般 别令飞机强烈摆动 Make no violent control movements like you did in the fighter planes.

617
00:57:48,045 --> 00:57:51,037
好，我会放走自动机师 All right. l'll unlock the automatic pilot.

618
00:57:56,853 --> 00:58:00,289
操纵杆会比战机的重 The controls will feel very heavy compared to a fighter,

619
00:58:02,326 --> 00:58:05,693
别担心，这是正常的 Don't worry about that, lt's perfectly normal,

620
00:58:17,741 --> 00:58:19,106
有一件事 Now, one more thing,

621
00:58:19,376 --> 00:58:22,971
可否找人来负责无线电通讯？ Can somebody work the radio and leave you free for flying?

622
00:58:23,246 --> 00:58:28,081
-空姐就在我旁 -她可以坐到副机师位置 - The stewardess is here with me. - Have her sit in the co-pilot seat,

623
00:58:30,187 --> 00:58:33,384
绮莲，他想你坐到副机师座位 Elaine, he wants you to sit in the co-pilot seat.

624
00:58:41,531 --> 00:58:43,999
发生什么事？我们有权知道 What's going on? We have a right to know the truth.

625
00:58:45,802 --> 00:58:47,770
好，我会向你们坦白 All right, l'll level with you all.

626
00:58:48,038 --> 00:58:51,030
最重要是保持冷静 The most important thing is that you remain calm.

627
00:58:51,341 --> 00:58:53,332
绝对不用惊慌 There's no reason to panic.

628
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:56,738
我们确有一名机员病倒 lt's true one of the crew members is ill.

629
00:58:57,014 --> 00:58:58,777
有些少不舒服 Slightly ill.

630
00:58:59,049 --> 00:59:01,449
但另外两名机师没事 The other two pilots are fine.

631
00:59:01,718 --> 00:59:06,155
他们正在驾驶飞机，全力以赴 They're flying the plane, free to pursue a life of religious fulfilment.

632
00:59:06,957 --> 00:59:11,417
你来负责无线电通讯 留意第三号引擎表板 The radio is all yours. Keep an eye on number three engine gauge.

633
00:59:11,662 --> 00:59:13,095
有点热 lt's running a little hot.

634
00:59:13,397 --> 00:59:16,264
（有点热）

635
00:59:16,533 --> 00:59:19,502
史，首先我要说… Striker, first l'd like to say something,

636
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:23,333
我知道现在你那处一定一团糟 l know things must look pretty rough up there.

637
00:59:23,607 --> 00:59:26,201
但若你一切都依我的 lf you do what l tell you when l tell you,

638
00:59:26,476 --> 00:59:29,001
你不该没有自信 there's no reason you should lack confidence

639
00:59:29,279 --> 00:59:32,771
你绝对做得到的 in your chances of coming out alive and in one piece,

640
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:35,314
天气如何？ What weather are you in?

644
00:59:47,097 --> 00:59:49,497
不大好，湿透了 Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.

645
00:59:49,733 --> 00:59:52,531
史泰德，你做得很好 All right, Striker. You're doing just fine.

646
00:59:53,704 --> 00:59:56,935
幸好他不知道我很讨厌他 lt's damn good he doesn't know l hate his guts.

647
00:59:57,207 --> 01:00:00,699
幸好你不知道我很讨厌你 lt's damn good you don't know he hates your guts.

648
01:00:07,417 --> 01:00:10,045
有什么可以帮忙？ Can l get you something?

649

抱歉，我不明白 l'm sorry. l don't understand.

650
01:00:18,929 --> 01:00:22,160
-小姐，我懂说非洲话 -好极了 - Stewardess. l speak jive. - Good.

651
01:00:22,466 --> 01:00:27,028

652
01:00:27,304 --> 01:00:31,536
叫他放松，我拿药来 Tell him to relax. l'll be back with some medicine.

653
01:00:34,644 --> 01:00:39,013
放松，她会拿药来 Just hang loose, blood. She'll get some medicine.

654
01:00:39,282 --> 01:00:41,773
我并非省油的灯 My Mama didn't raise no dummies, that's obvious.

655
01:00:42,052 --> 01:00:44,782
别说废话了 Cut me some slack, Jack.

656
01:00:47,758 --> 01:00:51,421
他不想帮忙… Chump don't want no help, chump don't get the help.

657
01:00:51,695 --> 01:00:54,789
那厮是没有脑袋的 That dude's got no brains, anyhow.

658
01:01:01,404 --> 01:01:04,464
通知欧机长的太太吧！ Let Captain Oveurs wife know what's going on.

659
01:01:04,741 --> 01:01:07,232
刚收到最新的天气报告 This weather bulletin just came off the wire.

665

我们并不知道情况有多严重 We don't know how serious it is,

666

但麦斯堤认为你最好来这里 but Steve McCroskey thought you'd want to come over,

还未可以 你该快进入雷达范围了 Not yet. You'll be in radar range any second now.

682
01:02:58,121 --> 01:03:00,817
他们该在十分钟前已进入范围 They should have been in range 10 minutes ago.

683
01:03:01,725 --> 01:03:05,456
古达臣，再查看雷达 有何发现？ Gunderson, check the radar range. Anything yet?

684
01:03:05,729 --> 01:03:07,924
尚要两分钟 About two more minutes, chief.

685
01:03:11,835 --> 01:03:15,862
-他们可能偏离了航道 -没可能！是自动导航！ - They could be miles off course. - lmpossible! They're on instruments.

686
01:03:19,843 --> 01:03:22,243
今次一定很惊险 This is going to be a real sweat.

687
01:03:23,146 --> 01:03:25,478
古达臣，有最新消息就通知我 Gunderson, let me know when you get anything.

688
01:03:25,749 --> 01:03:28,912
-尼斯，有香烟吗？ -我再也受不了 - Got a cigarette, Nels? - l can't take much more of this.

689
01:03:33,189 --> 01:03:36,386
似乎我选错这星期戒安非他命 Looks like l picked the wrong week to quit amphetamines.

690
01:03:37,494 --> 01:03:39,223
-喝点咖啡吗？ -不用，谢谢 - How about some more coffee? - No, thanks.

691
01:03:39,496 --> 01:03:41,862
这些记者想你发表声明 These reporters want a statement.

692
01:03:42,132 --> 01:03:45,693
-他们能支持多久？ -三十到四十五分钟 - How much longer can they hold out? - 30, 45 minutes.

693
01:03:45,936 --> 01:03:48,336
-由谁来驾驶飞机？ -一名乘客 - Who's flying the plane? - A passenger.

694
01:03:48,638 --> 01:03:53,041
他是一名富经验的空军机师 不用担心，你来吧 He's an experienced air-force pilot. No cause for alarm. Take over.

695
01:03:53,310 --> 01:03:56,711
-是怎样的飞机？ -又大又漂亮的白色飞机 - What kind of plane? - lt's a big, pretty white plane

696
01:03:56,980 --> 01:04:02,213
有红色条子、窗帘、轮子 就像一架大模型 with red stripes, curtains and wheels. lt looks like a big Tylenol.

697
01:04:03,186 --> 01:04:05,552
好，拿些照片吧！ OK, boys. Let's get some pictures.

698
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,491
（航机乘客大难临头）

699
01:04:21,871 --> 01:04:24,396
（芝加哥机长作出最坏打算）

700
01:04:27,043 --> 01:04:30,240
（男孩被困在冰箱 吃掉自己的脚）

701
01:04:32,816 --> 01:04:34,909
（危机）

702
01:04:35,218 --> 01:04:38,415
最新消息，那航机飞往芝加哥 This bulletinjust handed to me, Stricken airliner approaching Chicago,

703
01:04:52,936 --> 01:04:55,803
他们自作自受 Shana, they bought their tickets.

704
01:04:56,106 --> 01:04:58,734
他们早知道有危险 They knew what they were getting into.

705
01:05:00,110 --> 01:05:03,045
让航机坠毁吧 l say, let them crash!

706
01:05:18,395 --> 01:05:21,489
-要威士忌吗？ -不要 - Would you like some whisky, ma'am? - Certainly not!

707
01:05:33,743 --> 01:05:35,904
乘客怎么样？ How are the passengers?

708
01:05:36,179 --> 01:05:39,979
我不会骗你，我们时间无多了 l won't deceive you, Mr Striker. We're running out of time.

709
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:44,209
-你一定可以做什么的 -我已尽一切办法… - Surely, there's something you can do. - l'm doing everything l can...

710
01:05:44,487 --> 01:05:46,580
也不要再说我有办法 and stop calling me Shirley.

711
01:06:10,747 --> 01:06:13,238
兰迪，你没事吧？ Randy, are you all right?

712
01:06:13,516 --> 01:06:15,575
雷医生 Oh, Dr Rumack.

713
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:20,283
我很害怕，从没这般害怕 l'm scared. l've never been so scared...

714
01:06:21,524 --> 01:06:24,721
而且我26岁了，还未结婚 And besides, l'm 26 and l'm not married.

715
01:06:24,994 --> 01:06:28,430
我们定会成功的，你定要相信 We're going to make it. You've got to believe that.

716
01:06:28,698 --> 01:06:31,724
雷医生，知否我们何时着陆？ Dr Rumack, do you have any idea when we'll be landing?

717
01:06:32,001 --> 01:06:34,663
快了，你觉得怎样？ Pretty soon. How are you bearing up?

718
01:06:34,938 --> 01:06:37,771
坦白说，我从来没那么惊慌过 To be honest, l've never been so scared,

719
01:06:38,041 --> 01:06:40,441
但幸好我有丈夫 but at least l have a husband.

720
01:06:53,356 --> 01:06:56,689
保持队形，目标就在前面 Stay in formation, Target'sjust ahead,

721
01:06:56,893 --> 01:06:59,862
若飞得够低，该能看清楚目标 Target should be clear if you go in low enough,

722
01:07:00,163 --> 01:07:03,690
你得决定… You'll have to decide, You'll have to decide,

723
01:07:03,933 --> 01:07:06,026
你得决定 You'll have to decide,

724
01:07:06,336 --> 01:07:09,669
保持队形，目标就在前面 Stay in formation, Target'sjust ahead,

725
01:07:09,906 --> 01:07:12,875
若飞得够低，该看清楚目标 Target should be clear if you go in low enough,

726
01:07:13,176 --> 01:07:16,509
你得决定… You'll have to decide, You'll have to decide,

727
01:07:16,779 --> 01:07:18,144
你得决定 You'll have to decide,

728
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,785
糟糕！四号引擎没有了 Oh, rats! Lost number four.

729
01:07:27,056 --> 01:07:29,320
发生什么事？有何不妥？ What happened? What went wrong?

730
01:07:29,559 --> 01:07:32,426
我忘了检查油压 l forgot to check the oil pressure.

731
01:07:33,296 --> 01:07:36,493
若给祈力斯知道，定给他臭骂 When Kramer hears about this, the shit's going to hit the fan.

732
01:07:39,202 --> 01:07:41,796
早叫他检查油压，他怎么了？ l told him to watch that oil temperature. What's he doing?

733
01:07:42,038 --> 01:07:44,973
史泰德，飞机无法自行降落 Stiker, that plane can't land itself.

734
01:07:45,275 --> 01:07:48,802
这不是他的错 任何机师都可能会这样 Ease off. lt's not his fault. lt could happen to any pilot.

735
01:07:49,112 --> 01:07:50,306
施丹域亦出现这情形 lt happened to Barbara Stanwyck.

736
01:07:50,547 --> 01:07:53,880
别逼得他太紧，他可能会崩溃 Can't push him too hard. Might break. Remember who you're dealing with.

737
01:07:54,184 --> 01:07:57,119
尼克、彼得、谢利，紧急状态 Nick, Pete, Jerry, there's a fire in the barn.

738
01:07:58,821 --> 01:08:01,585
他说得对，我应付不了压力 He's right. l can't take the pressure.

739
01:08:02,625 --> 01:08:04,456
我以为可以令飞机降落 实在妄想 l was crazy to think l could land this plane.

740
01:08:04,727 --> 01:08:10,563
-泰德，只有你… -我不管，我没有这个能力 - But, Ted, you're the only... - l don't care. l don't have what it takes.

741
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:14,462
找过从没驾驶过飞机的人来 结果可能更好 They'd be better off with someone who's never flown before.

742
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:26,711
坏消息，雾越来越浓 Bad news. Fog's getting thicker.

743
01:08:27,951 --> 01:08:31,079
李安亦越来越大 And Leon's getting larger.

744
01:08:55,144 --> 01:08:58,580
我知道你想说什么，省口气吧 l know what you're going to say, so save your breath.

745
01:09:00,516 --> 01:09:03,383
我并没想要说什么 Well, l don't have a thing to say.

746
01:09:04,187 --> 01:09:06,382
你已尽了力 You've done the best you could.

747
01:09:06,623 --> 01:09:09,091
真的，你已尽了力 You really have. The best you could.

748
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:12,694
凡事岂能尽如人意 We can't expect to win them all.

749
01:09:14,297 --> 01:09:19,098
告诉你我保守了多年的秘密 l want to tell you something l've kept to myself through these years.

750
01:09:19,369 --> 01:09:22,202
我在战时是军医 l was in the war. Medical corps.

751
01:09:23,239 --> 01:09:28,302
有一晚他们送来一名重伤机师 One night, they brought in a badly wounded pilot from a raid.

752
01:09:28,578 --> 01:09:30,671
他几乎不能说话 He could barely talk.

753
01:09:30,947 --> 01:09:34,007
但他望着我说 He looked up at me, he said,

754
01:09:34,284 --> 01:09:38,311
“我们形势不利 但还是勇往直前” '"The odds were against us up there, but we went in anyway.

755
01:09:38,588 --> 01:09:42,388
“我很高兴 上尉作出正确决定” ''l'm glad. Captain made the right decision.''

756
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:47,452
那机师的名字叫做薛佐治 The pilot's name was George Zip.

757
01:09:48,898 --> 01:09:51,298
薛佐治说的？ George Zip said that?

758
01:09:52,535 --> 01:09:56,995
他最后对我说： “医生…” The last thing he said to me, ''Doc,'' he said, ''Sometime...

759
01:09:58,441 --> 01:10:00,705
“队员都全力以赴” ''..the crew is up against it.

760
01:10:00,977 --> 01:10:03,002
“我们虽然受到挫折” '"The breaks are beating the boys.

761
01:10:03,279 --> 01:10:06,442
“但告诉他们要倾尽全力” '"Tell them to give it all they've got

762
01:10:07,984 --> 01:10:11,147
“为部队胜出一仗” ''and win just one for the Zipper.

763
01:10:13,356 --> 01:10:15,722
“到时我不知道 自己会身在何处” ''l don't know where l'll be then,'' he said...

764
01:10:17,827 --> 01:10:21,024
“但肯定已全身发臭” ''but l won't smell too good, that's for sure.''

765
01:10:23,533 --> 01:10:25,398
医生，失陪 Excuse me, Doc.

766
01:10:26,336 --> 01:10:28,497
我要令飞机着陆 l've got a plane to land.

767
01:10:36,412 --> 01:10:40,439
留在上空，待大雾消散才降落 You'd better stay up there a bit, When the fog lifts, we'll bring you in,

768
01:10:40,717 --> 01:10:42,708
绮莲，让我来 l'll take it, Elaine.

769
01:10:50,693 --> 01:10:54,857
听着，雷医生说病人情况危殆 Listen, Dr Rumack says the sick people are in critical condition.

770
01:10:55,164 --> 01:10:58,031
每分每秒都很重要 要现在降落了 Every minute counts. We've got to land now.

771
01:10:58,334 --> 01:11:02,361
别傻了 你也知道这样降落结果会如何 Don't be a fool, Striker. You know what a landing like this means.

772
01:11:02,638 --> 01:11:04,367
我命令你继续在上空 l'm ordering you to stay up there!

773
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:06,403
不行 No dice, Chicago.

774
01:11:06,676 --> 01:11:09,372
现在由我话事，我们要降落了 l'm giving the orders, and we're coming in.

775
01:11:09,645 --> 01:11:12,443
现在他反客为主了 l guess the foot's on the other hand now.

776
01:11:15,418 --> 01:11:17,409
这样大雾，他是不会成功的 He'll never make it in this soup.

777
01:11:17,687 --> 01:11:21,179
但现在由他话事了 But it's his ship now. He's in charge.

778
01:11:21,457 --> 01:11:24,324
他是老板、上头、首领… He's the boss, head man, top dog,

779
01:11:24,594 --> 01:11:27,757
-领袖、老大… -上尉，看！ - big cheese, head honcho... - Captain, look at this!

780
01:11:29,399 --> 01:11:31,594
“乘客必死无疑” ''Passengers certain to die.''

781
01:11:31,834 --> 01:11:33,927
“航空当局疏忽” ''Airline negligent.''

782
01:11:34,237 --> 01:11:36,205
百货公司大减价！ There's a sale at Penny's!

783
01:11:39,308 --> 01:11:42,402
我要三人往控制塔 黎保家、马卡斯 l'll need three men up in the tower. You, Neubauer, you, Macias.

784
01:11:42,678 --> 01:11:44,612
还有我， “大树”约翰 Me John. Big tree.

785
01:11:45,715 --> 01:11:48,479
史，我们准备往控制塔 祝你好运 Striker, we're going to the tower. Good luck.

786
01:11:49,252 --> 01:11:52,551
-我们准备往控制塔 -控制塔 - We're going to the tower. - The tower! The tower!

787
01:11:52,789 --> 01:11:55,121
林宝素… Rapunzel! Rapunzel!

788
01:11:59,595 --> 01:12:02,189
小姐，尚有多久才降落？ Stewardess, how soon till we land?

789
01:12:02,498 --> 01:12:05,228
快了，别担心 lt won't be long now. Try not to worry.

790
01:12:18,981 --> 01:12:22,644
我们准备好了 麦机长，这是罗机长 We're all ready, sir. Captain McCroskey, this is Captain Roberts.

791
01:12:22,919 --> 01:12:26,719
祈上尉、高机长 韩机长、简机长 Captain Kramer, Captain Colosimo. Captain Hinshaw, Captain Gantz.

793
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,825
高，你负责联络 Colosimo, you work the relay.

794
01:12:33,129 --> 01:12:35,120
罗，看看航空交通 Roberts, check air traffic.

795
01:12:35,898 --> 01:12:38,560
拿出手指来，很脏的 Get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where it's been.

796
01:12:41,637 --> 01:12:43,662
-史堤 -尼斯，有香烟吗？ - Steve! - Got a cigarette, Nels?

797
01:12:43,906 --> 01:12:47,740
莲黛，你的丈夫 和其他人仍活着，但昏迷了 Linda, your husband and the others are alive but unconscious.

798
01:12:48,044 --> 01:12:49,978
就像福特 Just like Gerald Ford.

799
01:12:50,246 --> 01:12:54,342
若史及时降落 我们便有机会救他们 There's a chance we can save them if Striker lands that plane in time.

800
01:12:54,617 --> 01:12:57,347
-但机会不大吧？ -不知道 - That isn't much of a chance, is it? - l don't know.

801
01:12:57,620 --> 01:13:00,282
我们已尽了力，失陪 We're doing everything we can. Now excuse me.

802
01:13:04,126 --> 01:13:06,788
你从哪儿买来这裙子？很难看 Where did you get that dress? lt's awful!

803
01:13:07,029 --> 01:13:09,998
还有这对鞋和大衣，天啊！ And those shoes and that coat! Geez!

804
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:17,899
八哩，转右往044 8 miles. Turn right to heading 044.

805
01:13:20,209 --> 01:13:23,235
我们现在于二千英尺上空 开始降落 We're now at 2,000 feet beginning our descent,

806
01:13:23,513 --> 01:13:27,973
-把跑道所有灯亮起 -已经这样做了 - Pour every light onto that field. - lt's being done.

807
01:13:32,455 --> 01:13:35,720
控制塔呼叫所有救急汽车 前往九号跑道 Tower to all emergency vehicles, runway is niner.

808
01:13:36,726 --> 01:13:39,354
机场汽车，一、二号准备 Airport vehicles, take positions one and two,

809

所有救护车往三号站 All ambulances go to number three,

812
01:13:49,305 --> 01:13:52,297
以色列航机，请驶离跑道 Air lsrael, please clear the runway,

813
01:13:58,214 --> 01:14:01,240
我们将要你们摆出撞击姿势 ln a moment, we'll ask you to assume crash positions.

814
01:14:01,517 --> 01:14:04,281
椅子下面有救生衣 Life jackets are under your seat.

815
01:14:04,554 --> 01:14:09,651
套上去，我一声令下 就拉右面的绳子 Place it over your head. When l give the word, pull the cord on the right side flap.

816
01:14:11,694 --> 01:14:14,993
你们的椅垫都有浮水设计 Your seat cushions are also equipped with a flotation device.

817
01:14:16,165 --> 01:14:20,397
芝加哥的WAZA电台 永远为你播放 WZAZ in Chicago, where disco lives forever,

818
01:14:24,173 --> 01:14:26,607
你的飞行高度忽高忽低 Your altitude's too erratic.

819
01:14:26,876 --> 01:14:30,312
不能降落 你尚有两小时的燃料 You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel for two hours.

820
01:14:31,347 --> 01:14:34,612
绮莲，让我来…祈，你听着 l'll take it, Elaine. Listen to me, Kramer.

821
01:14:34,884 --> 01:14:38,684
机上有人在不足一小时后 就会死去 We have people up here who will die in less than an hour.

822
01:14:38,955 --> 01:14:41,253
我或会令飞机损毁 但我可以成功降落的 l may bend your airplane, but l'll get it down.

823
01:14:41,490 --> 01:14:43,754
我要放下降落架了 l'm putting the landing gear down.

824
01:14:44,026 --> 01:14:47,894
-乘客都准备好了 -劳驾 - The passengers are ready. - Thanks, Randy.

825
01:14:48,230 --> 01:14:51,222
你还是出去吧！ 在这儿你可能会受伤 You better leave, sweetheart. You might get hurt up here.

826
01:15:01,277 --> 01:15:04,440
-泰德 -什么事？ - Ted... - Yes?

827
01:15:05,481 --> 01:15:08,814
我想你知道…现在… l wanted you to know... now...

828
01:15:09,118 --> 01:15:11,109
我以你为傲 l'm very proud.

829
01:15:15,124 --> 01:15:17,649
告诉他们降落架已放下 我们准备降落 Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.

830
01:15:21,530 --> 01:15:24,499
降落架已放下，我们准备降落 The gear is down, and we're ready to land.

831
01:15:26,469 --> 01:15:30,235
好，已进入最后阶段 只亮起九号跑道的灯 All right. He's on final now. Put out all runway lights except niner.

832
01:15:32,341 --> 01:15:36,175
上尉，我们或许该亮起搜索灯 Captain, maybe we ought to turn on the searchlights now.

833
01:15:37,013 --> 01:15:38,776
不 No.

834
01:15:39,048 --> 01:15:42,677
他们就是以为我们会这样做 That's just what they'll be expecting us to do.

835
01:15:47,390 --> 01:15:51,087
祝你们好运，我们全看你们了 l want to tell you both good luck. We're all counting on you.

836
01:15:53,229 --> 01:15:57,757
小心听着，在三百英尺高度 你便会见到跑道 Now listen carefully. You'll see the runway at 300 feet.

837
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:03,097
在跑道三分一位置时着陆 有微风，准备好 Aim to touch down a third of the way. A slight cross wind, so be ready.

838
01:16:04,173 --> 01:16:08,633
若着陆得太快，用紧急煞掣 即右前方的红色手掣 lf you land too fast, use your emergency brakes. Red handle's right in front.

839
01:16:08,911 --> 01:16:11,106
若这样还不停下 lf that doesn't stop you...

840
01:16:16,318 --> 01:16:20,015
就熄掉四个引擎 lf that doesn't stop you, cut the four ignition switches.

841
01:16:23,826 --> 01:16:27,990
看到我们没有？ 你该看到机场了 Can you see us now?. You should be able to see the field.

842
01:16:35,204 --> 01:16:38,503
-外面很平静 -对，太平静了 - Sure is quiet out there. - Yeah, too quiet.

843
01:16:40,543 --> 01:16:43,774
似乎我选错了这星期戒闻胶水 Looks like l picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue.

844
01:16:56,859 --> 01:16:58,724
它来了！ There it is.

845
01:17:00,930 --> 01:17:02,522
他来了！ There he is!

846

-速度太快了 -我知道… - You're coming in too fast. - l know, l know!

847
01:17:08,104 --> 01:17:09,867
他知道… He knows, he knows!

848
01:17:12,742 --> 01:17:15,108
现在低于七百英尺，仍在下降 Below 700 now. Still going down.

849
01:17:15,377 --> 01:17:20,872
675英尺、650英尺、625英尺 稳住了，不，正下降 675, 650, 625, he's holding. No, he's down, he's down.

850
01:17:21,183 --> 01:17:23,117
发出警号吧 Sound your alarm now.

851
01:17:25,154 --> 01:17:27,782
大家请准备撞机 Now, everybody, get in crash positions.

852
01:17:33,195 --> 01:17:35,060
风门翼要三十度 Put down 30 degrees of flap.

853
01:17:38,968 --> 01:17:43,928
听着，煞掣，按钮，准备 Listen to me. Remember your brakes and switches. Get ready to flare it out!

854
01:17:44,707 --> 01:17:49,906
他一时在九百英尺 一时在一千三百英尺，真是笨蛋 He's all over the place. 900 up to 1 ,300 feet. What an asshole.

855
01:17:50,179 --> 01:17:52,807
靠左，风门翼更加偏侧 More left rudder, Put down more flap,

856
01:17:58,354 --> 01:18:00,151
开玩笑而已 Just kidding!

857
01:18:01,323 --> 01:18:04,258
史，升起机头，伸直机翼 Striker, lift your nose, Straighten your wings,

858
01:18:04,527 --> 01:18:07,394
太快了，留意速度 Coming in too fast. Watch your speed.

859
01:18:07,663 --> 01:18:09,756
他向我们冲来！ He's coming right at us!

860
01:18:14,003 --> 01:18:17,200
太快了，减慢速度 Coming in too hot. Ease up on the throttle.

861
01:18:17,506 --> 01:18:22,170
留意风向，左翼倾侧 Watch out for that cross wind, Level it out, Dip your left wing,

862
01:18:25,981 --> 01:18:29,382
你偏离了航道，望着跑道末端 You're drifting, Keep your eyes on the far end of the runway,

863
01:18:32,054 --> 01:18:33,544
太低了，糟糕！ You're too low, damn it!

864
01:18:35,357 --> 01:18:37,052
留意速度 Watch your stall speed,

865
01:18:40,429 --> 01:18:41,953
慢慢降落！ Flare it out!

866

慢慢让它着陆，着陆吧！ Ease her down. Down!

881
01:20:35,444 --> 01:20:37,378
但我们有好些人，特别是我 But some of us, particularly me,

887

圣诞对你有何意义？ 对我来说则是活受罪 Christmas, what does that mean to you? Mine was a living hell,

888
01:21:08,877 --> 01:21:12,506
