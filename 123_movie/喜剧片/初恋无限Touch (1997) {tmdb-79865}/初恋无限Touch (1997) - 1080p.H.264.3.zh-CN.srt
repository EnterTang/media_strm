1
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,116
Thirteen meters. You should see it.

2
00:02:26,474 --> 00:02:28,782
Okay, take her up and over the bow rail.

3
00:02:30,395 --> 00:02:33,591
Okay, Mir-2, we're going over the bow.
Stay with us.

4
00:03:08,014 --> 00:03:10,005
Okay, quiet. We're rolling.

5
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:14,123
Seeing her coming out of the darkness
like a ghost ship...

6
00:03:14,354 --> 00:03:16,265
still gets me every time.

7
00:03:17,524 --> 00:03:20,755
To see the sad ruin of the great ship,
sitting here...

8
00:03:21,737 --> 00:03:26,094
where she landed at 2:30 in the morning
of April 15, 1912...

9
00:03:26,783 --> 00:03:28,580
after her long fall...

10
00:03:29,536 --> 00:03:31,254
from the world above.

11
00:03:31,955 --> 00:03:34,071
You're so full of shit, boss.

12
00:04:04,153 --> 00:04:05,303
Dive six.

13
00:04:05,614 --> 00:04:08,286
Here we are again on the deck of Titanic.

14
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,401
Two and a half miles down.

15
00:04:11,035 --> 00:04:13,185
3,821 meters.

16
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,209
The pressure outside
is three and a half tons per square inch.

17
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:21,178
These windows are nine inches thick
and if they go...

18
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:23,688
it's sayonara in two microseconds.

19
00:04:24,548 --> 00:04:26,937
All right, enough of that bullshit.

20
00:04:40,982 --> 00:04:44,132
Just put her down on the roof
of the officers' quarters like yesterday.

21
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:45,348
Sure.

22
00:04:45,694 --> 00:04:48,572
Okay, Mir-2, we're landing
right over the Grand Staircase.

23
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,577
You guys set to launch?

24
00:04:50,866 --> 00:04:53,699
Yeah, Brock, launching Dunkin now.
Go, Charlie.

25
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:04,038
- All right, tether out.
- Tether out.

26
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:07,463
Okay, Brock,
we're dropping down along the hull.

27
00:05:10,261 --> 00:05:14,412
Yeah, roger that. Okay, drop down,
and go into the first-class gangway door.

28
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:18,879
I want you guys working the D deck
reception area and the dining saloon.

29
00:05:19,727 --> 00:05:21,001
Copy that.

30
00:05:26,901 --> 00:05:28,016
- Tether out.
- Tether out.

31
00:05:28,153 --> 00:05:30,189
Okay, now left. Now left. Left, left.

32
00:05:39,122 --> 00:05:42,558
Snoop Dog is on the move.
We're headed down the stairwell.

33
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,870
Okay, Lewis, drop down to B deck.

34
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:49,238
A deck.

35
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:52,056
- Give me some rope, Captain.
- B deck. Get in there.

36
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:34,454
- Watch the door frame. Watch it.
- I see it. I got it.

37
00:06:41,392 --> 00:06:42,586
We're good. Just chill, boss.

38
00:06:56,448 --> 00:06:58,166
Okay, make your turn.

39
00:06:59,117 --> 00:07:01,506
- Cable out, Captain.
- Make your turn. Watch the wall.

40
00:07:01,703 --> 00:07:04,092
Brock, we're at the piano. You copy?

41
00:07:04,623 --> 00:07:05,851
Copy that.

42
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,240
Right there.

43
00:07:15,384 --> 00:07:18,342
- That's it. That's the bedroom door.
- I see it.

44
00:07:28,146 --> 00:07:31,138
We're in. We're in, baby. We're there.

45
00:07:33,735 --> 00:07:37,171
That's Hockley's bed.
That's where the son of a bitch slept.

46
00:07:43,203 --> 00:07:45,478
Oops. Somebody left the water running.

47
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:48,461
Hold it. Just a second.
Go back to the right.

48
00:07:54,965 --> 00:07:57,160
That wardrobe door. Get closer.

49
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:01,046
- You're smelling something, boss.
- I want to see what's under it.

50
00:08:01,262 --> 00:08:03,059
Give me my hands, man.

51
00:08:08,352 --> 00:08:09,580
All right.

52
00:08:11,022 --> 00:08:13,695
- Take it easy. It might come apart.
- Okay.

53
00:08:15,109 --> 00:08:18,419
Okay, go. Flip it over. Go. Turn over.

54
00:08:18,863 --> 00:08:20,296
Keep going. Go.

55
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,719
Okay, drop it.

56
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,264
Oh, baby. Are you seeing this, boss?

57
00:08:37,965 --> 00:08:39,557
It's payday, boys.

58
00:08:55,608 --> 00:08:56,882
Cha-ching!

59
00:08:58,277 --> 00:09:00,745
- We did it, Bobby.
- We brought it back.

60
00:09:01,113 --> 00:09:02,307
Oh, yeah! You the man!

61
00:09:02,448 --> 00:09:05,519
Who's the best, baby? Say it.

62
00:09:05,992 --> 00:09:07,471
You are, Lewis.

63
00:09:10,121 --> 00:09:12,237
- Bobby, my cigar.
- Right here.

64
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,819
Okay, crack her open.

65
00:09:24,428 --> 00:09:25,543
Let me get around. Hang on.

66
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,953
- You getting it?
- Got it.

67
00:09:51,287 --> 00:09:52,356
Shit.

68
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,814
No diamond.

69
00:09:57,168 --> 00:09:59,398
You know, boss,
this same thing happened to Geraldo...

70
00:09:59,587 --> 00:10:01,145
and his career never recovered.

71
00:10:06,177 --> 00:10:07,530
Turn the camera off.

72
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,796
Brock. The partners would like to know
how it's going.

73
00:10:11,683 --> 00:10:14,833
Hey, Dave. Barry, hi.
Look, it wasn't in the safe.

74
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,450
Don't worry about it. There are
still plenty of places it could be.

75
00:10:18,689 --> 00:10:19,678
Hell, yes.

76
00:10:19,815 --> 00:10:22,170
The floor debris in the suite,
the mother's room...

77
00:10:22,359 --> 00:10:24,714
- The purser's safe on C deck.
- Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase.

78
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:26,098
A dozen other places.

79
00:10:26,238 --> 00:10:29,469
Guys, look, you just got to trust
my instincts. I know we're close.

80
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,931
We just got to go through
a little process of elimination.

81
00:10:33,788 --> 00:10:35,346
Hang on a second.

82
00:10:38,584 --> 00:10:41,860
- Let me see that.
- We might have something here, guys.

83
00:10:44,214 --> 00:10:47,331
- Where's the photograph of the necklace?
- We'll call you right back.

84
00:10:59,313 --> 00:11:00,826
I'll be goddamned.

85
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:06,684
Treasure hunter Brock Lovett
is best known for finding Spanish gold.

86
00:11:06,904 --> 00:11:09,372
It's okay, I'll feed you in a minute.

87
00:11:09,573 --> 00:11:13,202
He has chartered Russian subs to reach
the most famous shipwreck of all...

88
00:11:13,452 --> 00:11:14,771
the Titanic.

89
00:11:14,912 --> 00:11:18,427
He's with us live via satellite,
from the research ship Keldysh...

90
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:19,940
in the North Atlantic.

91
00:11:20,084 --> 00:11:22,120
- Hello, Brock.
- Hello, Tracy.

92
00:11:22,502 --> 00:11:25,221
Of course, everyone knows
the familiar stories ofTitanic.

93
00:11:25,421 --> 00:11:28,811
You know, the nobility of the band
playing to the very end and all that.

94
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,405
But what I'm interested in
are the untold stories...

95
00:11:31,594 --> 00:11:34,108
the secrets locked deep inside
the hull ofTitanic.

96
00:11:34,306 --> 00:11:37,503
And we're out here using robot technology
to go further into the wreck...

97
00:11:37,726 --> 00:11:39,478
than anybody has ever done before.

98
00:11:39,644 --> 00:11:41,794
Your expedition is at the center
of a storm...

99
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,858
of controversy over salvage rights,
and even ethics.

100
00:11:45,066 --> 00:11:46,818
Many are calling you a grave-robber.

101
00:11:46,985 --> 00:11:50,102
Nobody ever called the recovery
of the artifacts from King Tut's tomb...

102
00:11:50,322 --> 00:11:52,392
- What is it?
- Turn that up, dear.

103
00:11:52,574 --> 00:11:55,247
I have museum-trained experts
sent out here making sure...

104
00:11:55,452 --> 00:11:58,284
that these relics are preserved
and catalogued properly.

105
00:11:58,496 --> 00:12:01,329
Take a look at this drawing
that we found just today.

106
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:04,738
A piece of paper that's been underwater
for 84 years...

107
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:07,839
and my team are able to preserve it intact.

108
00:12:08,714 --> 00:12:12,548
Should this have remained unseen
at the bottom of the ocean for eternity?

109
00:12:12,885 --> 00:12:14,238
We can see it and...

110
00:12:14,387 --> 00:12:15,979
I'll be goddamned.

111
00:12:19,475 --> 00:12:22,353
Brock, there's a satellite call for you.

112
00:12:22,895 --> 00:12:26,127
Bobby, we're launching. See these
submersibles going in the water?

113
00:12:26,356 --> 00:12:29,110
Trust me, buddy,
you want to take this call.

114
00:12:30,277 --> 00:12:31,995
This better be good.

115
00:12:32,571 --> 00:12:35,802
- You got to speak up. She's kind of old.
- Great.

116
00:12:38,369 --> 00:12:40,758
This is Brock Lovett.
How can I help you, Mrs...

117
00:12:40,955 --> 00:12:42,707
Calvert. Rose Calvert.

118
00:12:43,082 --> 00:12:44,515
Mrs. Calvert?

119
00:12:45,501 --> 00:12:50,211
I was just wondering if you had found
the Heart of the Ocean yet, Mr. Lovett.

120
00:12:52,883 --> 00:12:55,238
Told you you wanted to take the call.

121
00:12:56,762 --> 00:12:59,355
All right, you have my attention, Rose.

122
00:12:59,764 --> 00:13:02,756
Can you tell us who the woman
in the picture is?

123
00:13:02,976 --> 00:13:05,570
Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.

124
00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:26,254
She's a goddamn liar!
Some nutcase seeking money or publicity.

125
00:13:27,084 --> 00:13:30,759
God only knows why!
Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia.

126
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:32,600
They're inbound!

127
00:13:37,969 --> 00:13:41,678
Rose Dewitt Bukater died on the Titanic
when she was 17, right?

128
00:13:41,931 --> 00:13:43,046
That's right.

129
00:13:43,182 --> 00:13:45,696
If she had lived, she'd be over 100 by now.

130
00:13:45,894 --> 00:13:48,010
101 next month.

131
00:13:48,313 --> 00:13:50,986
Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.

132
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:53,754
Look, I've already done the background
on this woman...

133
00:13:53,943 --> 00:13:57,652
all the way back to the '20s,
when she was working as an actress.

134
00:13:57,906 --> 00:14:00,784
An actress.
There's your first clue, Sherlock.

135
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:05,436
Her name was Rose Dawson back then.
Then she marries this guy named Calvert.

136
00:14:05,704 --> 00:14:09,141
They move to Cedar Rapids
and she punches out a couple of kids.

137
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:12,333
Now Calvert's dead, and from what I hear,
Cedar Rapids is dead.

138
00:14:12,545 --> 00:14:14,183
And everybody
who knows about the diamond...

139
00:14:14,338 --> 00:14:17,216
is supposed to be dead or on this boat,
but she knows.

140
00:14:30,646 --> 00:14:33,240
Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?

141
00:14:33,441 --> 00:14:35,159
Hurry up, give him a hand!

142
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,886
Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.
Welcome to the Keldysh.

143
00:14:41,032 --> 00:14:42,623
Okay, let's get her inside there.

144
00:14:43,909 --> 00:14:45,581
- Hi, Miss Calvert.
- Hi.

145
00:14:45,744 --> 00:14:48,542
- Welcome to the Keldysh.
- Thanks.

146
00:14:58,924 --> 00:14:59,913
Yes?

147
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:03,247
- Are your staterooms all right?
- Oh, yes, very nice.

148
00:15:03,888 --> 00:15:07,403
Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy?
She takes care of me.

149
00:15:08,517 --> 00:15:11,714
We met just a few minutes ago.
Remember, Nana, up on deck?

150
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:13,014
Oh, yeah...

151
00:15:14,355 --> 00:15:18,348
There. That's nice.
Have to have my pictures when I travel.

152
00:15:19,194 --> 00:15:22,391
Can I get you anything?
Is there anything you'd like?

153
00:15:22,864 --> 00:15:23,899
Yes.

154
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:26,644
I would like to see my drawing.

155
00:15:40,924 --> 00:15:45,042
Louis XVl wore a fabulous stone
called the Blue Diamond of the Crown.

156
00:15:45,637 --> 00:15:47,706
It disappeared in 1792.

157
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,393
About the same time old Louis
lost everything from the neck up.

158
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:56,242
The theory goes that the crown diamond
was chopped, too.

159
00:15:56,564 --> 00:16:00,876
Recut into a heart-like shape that became
known as the Heart of the Ocean.

160
00:16:01,235 --> 00:16:04,147
Today, it would be worth
more than the Hope Diamond.

161
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:08,562
It was a dreadful, heavy thing.
I only wore it this once.

162
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:11,378
You actually think this is you, Nana?

163
00:16:11,621 --> 00:16:13,100
It is me, dear.

164
00:16:13,957 --> 00:16:15,515
Wasn't I a dish?

165
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:20,182
I tracked it down
through insurance records.

166
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:24,054
An old claim that was settled
under terms of absolute secrecy.

167
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:27,978
Can you tell me
who the claimant was, Rose?

168
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,981
I should imagine someone named Hockley.

169
00:16:31,432 --> 00:16:34,663
Nathan Hockley. That's right.
Pittsburgh steel tycoon.

170
00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:40,195
The claim was for a diamond necklace
his son, Caledon, bought his fiancée, you.

171
00:16:41,275 --> 00:16:43,664
A week before he sailed on Titanic.

172
00:16:44,654 --> 00:16:47,168
It was filed right after the sinking.

173
00:16:47,824 --> 00:16:50,974
So the diamond had to have gone down
with the ship.

174
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:53,811
You see the date?

175
00:16:55,372 --> 00:16:56,930
"April 14, 1912."

176
00:16:57,165 --> 00:16:59,884
Which means if your grandmother
is who she says she is...

177
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:03,282
she was wearing the diamond
the day the Titanic sank.

178
00:17:03,505 --> 00:17:06,065
And that makes you my new best friend.

179
00:17:07,342 --> 00:17:10,652
These are some of the things
we recovered from your stateroom.

180
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,497
This was mine.

181
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:17,659
How extraordinary!

182
00:17:18,812 --> 00:17:22,168
And it looks the same as it did
the last time I saw it.

183
00:17:27,988 --> 00:17:30,217
The reflection has changed a bit.

184
00:17:47,173 --> 00:17:49,562
Are you ready to go back to Titanic?

185
00:17:53,221 --> 00:17:56,530
Here we go.
She hits the 'berg on the starboard side.

186
00:17:57,225 --> 00:18:01,820
She kind of bumps along, punching holes
like Morse code along the side...

187
00:18:02,104 --> 00:18:03,617
below the water line.

188
00:18:03,773 --> 00:18:05,843
Then the forward compartments
start to flood.

189
00:18:06,025 --> 00:18:09,859
Now, as the water level rises,
it spills over the watertight bulkheads...

190
00:18:10,112 --> 00:18:13,149
which, unfortunately,
don't go any higher than E deck.

191
00:18:13,366 --> 00:18:17,518
So now, as the bow goes down,
the stern rises up, slow at first...

192
00:18:17,787 --> 00:18:22,178
then faster and faster, until finally,
she's got her whole ass sticking in the air.

193
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:25,848
And that's a big ass.
We're talking 20,000, 30,000 tons.

194
00:18:26,379 --> 00:18:28,939
Okay? And the hull's not designed to deal
with that pressure.

195
00:18:29,132 --> 00:18:32,647
So what happens?
She splits, right down to the keel...

196
00:18:33,218 --> 00:18:35,414
and the stern falls back level.

197
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:40,856
Then as the bow sinks, it pulls the stern
vertical and then finally detaches.

198
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:46,373
Now the stern section kind of bobs there
like a cork for a couple of minutes...

199
00:18:46,649 --> 00:18:49,243
floods, and finally goes under
about 2:20 a. m...

200
00:18:49,443 --> 00:18:52,241
two hours and 40 minutes
after the collision.

201
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:57,118
The bow section planes away,
landing about a half a mile away...

202
00:18:57,368 --> 00:19:00,280
going 20, 30 knots
when it hits the ocean floor.

203
00:19:03,999 --> 00:19:05,352
Pretty cool, huh?

204
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,288
Thank you for that fine forensic analysis,
Mr. Bodine.

205
00:19:11,006 --> 00:19:13,315
Of course, the experience of it...

206
00:19:14,718 --> 00:19:16,549
was somewhat different.

207
00:19:17,387 --> 00:19:19,298
Will you share it with us?

208
00:20:13,984 --> 00:20:16,135
- I'm taking her to rest.
- No.

209
00:20:16,445 --> 00:20:18,242
- Come on, Nana.
- No!

210
00:20:23,452 --> 00:20:25,363
Give me the tape recorder.

211
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,223
Tell us, Rose.

212
00:20:31,377 --> 00:20:33,015
It's been 84 years.

213
00:20:33,546 --> 00:20:37,016
It's okay. Just try to remember anything,
anything at all.

214
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,848
Do you want to hear this or not,
Mr. Lovett?

215
00:20:45,098 --> 00:20:47,817
It's been 84 years...

216
00:20:49,811 --> 00:20:52,279
and I can still smell the fresh paint.

217
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,766
The china had never been used.

218
00:20:58,028 --> 00:21:00,417
The sheets had never been slept in.

219
00:21:02,783 --> 00:21:06,139
Titanic was called the ship of dreams.

220
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,104
And it was.

221
00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:11,682
It really was.

222
00:21:41,697 --> 00:21:45,849
All third-class passengers
with a forward berth...

223
00:21:46,118 --> 00:21:48,916
this way, please! This queue! Right here...

224
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:52,113
- It's a big boat, huh?
- Daddy, it's a ship.

225
00:21:52,332 --> 00:21:53,730
You're right.

226
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:25,873
I don't see what all the fuss is about.

227
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,596
It doesn't look any bigger
than the Mauretania.

228
00:22:28,784 --> 00:22:32,015
You can be blasé about some things, Rose,
but not about Titanic.

229
00:22:32,246 --> 00:22:36,205
It's over 100 feet longer than Mauretania,
and far more luxurious.

230
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,651
Your daughter is far too difficult
to impress, Ruth.

231
00:22:39,962 --> 00:22:42,157
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.

232
00:22:42,339 --> 00:22:44,853
It is unsinkable.
God himself could not sink this ship.

233
00:22:45,051 --> 00:22:47,770
Sir, you have to check your baggage
through the main terminal.

234
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,005
It's round that way, sir.

235
00:22:49,138 --> 00:22:51,493
I put my faith in you, good sir.
Now, kindly see my man.

236
00:22:51,682 --> 00:22:54,355
Yes, sir. It's my pleasure, sir.
If I can do anything at all...

237
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,834
Yes, right.

238
00:22:55,978 --> 00:22:59,731
All the trunks from that car there.
Twelve from here.

239
00:23:00,691 --> 00:23:05,206
And the safe, to the parlor suite,
rooms B-52, 54, 56.

240
00:23:07,447 --> 00:23:10,803
Ladies, we better hurry. Come along.

241
00:23:15,706 --> 00:23:17,617
- My coat?
- I have it, miss.

242
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:20,180
Queue here for health inspection.

243
00:23:20,461 --> 00:23:24,010
All third-class passengers
queue here for health inspection.

244
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,034
Chin up.

245
00:23:31,096 --> 00:23:33,768
- Welcome aboard, ma'am.
- Welcome to Titanic.

246
00:23:34,766 --> 00:23:38,315
It was the ship of dreams
to everyone else.

247
00:23:39,145 --> 00:23:41,261
To me, it was a slave ship...

248
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,659
taking me back to America in chains.

249
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,899
Outwardly, I was everything
a well brought up girl should be.

250
00:23:50,448 --> 00:23:52,518
Inside, I was screaming.

251
00:24:09,468 --> 00:24:12,425
Jack, you are pazzo.
You bet everything we have.

252
00:24:13,596 --> 00:24:16,474
When you got nothing,
you got nothing to lose.

253
00:24:23,606 --> 00:24:24,721
Sven?

254
00:24:25,692 --> 00:24:26,681
Bet.

255
00:24:46,086 --> 00:24:47,075
All right.

256
00:24:47,212 --> 00:24:50,409
Moment of truth.
Somebody's life is about to change.

257
00:24:51,717 --> 00:24:52,832
Brizio?

258
00:24:55,054 --> 00:24:56,453
- Niente.
- Niente.

259
00:24:57,932 --> 00:24:59,001
Olaf?

260
00:25:00,017 --> 00:25:01,166
Nothing.

261
00:25:01,477 --> 00:25:02,512
Sven?

262
00:25:07,066 --> 00:25:08,294
Two pair.

263
00:25:08,943 --> 00:25:10,501
I'm sorry, Fabrizio.

264
00:25:10,652 --> 00:25:12,563
Che sorry, ma vaffanculo!
Did you bet all our money?

265
00:25:12,737 --> 00:25:16,616
I'm sorry, you're not going to
see your mom again for a long time.

266
00:25:17,242 --> 00:25:20,120
'Cause we're going to America.
Full house, boys.

267
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:35,374
Come on.

268
00:25:36,553 --> 00:25:38,032
I'm going home!

269
00:25:40,849 --> 00:25:43,409
- I'm going home.
- I go to America!

270
00:25:44,186 --> 00:25:45,379
No, mate.

271
00:25:45,688 --> 00:25:49,123
Titanic go to America, in five minutes.

272
00:25:50,109 --> 00:25:52,576
Shit, Fabri. Come on. Come on, here.

273
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:58,397
We're riding in high style now.
We're a couple of regular swells.

274
00:25:58,658 --> 00:26:01,650
We're practically goddamn royalty,
ragazzo mio.

275
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:03,906
You see? Is my destino.

276
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,311
Like I told you,
I go to America to be millionaire.

277
00:26:10,462 --> 00:26:13,499
- You are pazzo.
- Maybe, but I've got the tickets.

278
00:26:15,466 --> 00:26:17,775
- I thought you were fast.
- Aspetta!

279
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,684
Wait! Hey, wait!

280
00:26:20,889 --> 00:26:22,880
We're passengers! Passengers!

281
00:26:25,142 --> 00:26:26,894
Have you been through
the inspection queue?

282
00:26:27,061 --> 00:26:28,096
Of course.

283
00:26:28,229 --> 00:26:31,380
Anyway, we don't have any lice.
We're Americans, both of us.

284
00:26:31,774 --> 00:26:33,412
Right. Come aboard.

285
00:26:37,154 --> 00:26:40,464
We're the luckiest sons of bitches
in the world. You know that?

286
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:50,986
Goodbye!

287
00:26:54,631 --> 00:26:57,428
- You know somebody?
- Of course not. That's not the point.

288
00:26:57,633 --> 00:26:59,988
- Goodbye. I'll miss you.
- Goodbye!

289
00:27:00,177 --> 00:27:02,737
- Goodbye.
- I will never forget you!

290
00:27:50,727 --> 00:27:52,445
Come with me, darling. Let's go.

291
00:27:57,693 --> 00:27:59,046
G-60.

292
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:01,168
Excuse me, ma'am.

293
00:28:04,699 --> 00:28:06,018
Right here.

294
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:09,435
How you doing? Jack. Nice to meet you.

295
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:12,752
Jack Dawson. Nice to meet you.
How you doing?

296
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,900
Who says you get top bunk?

297
00:28:21,591 --> 00:28:23,980
This is your private promenade deck, sir.

298
00:28:24,177 --> 00:28:26,896
Would you be requiring anything?
Excuse me.

299
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:29,405
- This one?
- No.

300
00:28:29,766 --> 00:28:31,757
It had a lot of faces on it.

301
00:28:32,893 --> 00:28:34,406
This is the one.

302
00:28:35,855 --> 00:28:37,890
Would you like all of them out, miss?

303
00:28:38,065 --> 00:28:40,738
Yes, we need a little color in this room.

304
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,532
Put it in there. In the wardrobe.

305
00:28:47,283 --> 00:28:49,513
God, not those finger-paintings again.

306
00:28:49,702 --> 00:28:51,499
They certainly were a waste of money.

307
00:28:51,662 --> 00:28:54,938
The difference between Cal's taste
in art and mine is that I have some.

308
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:56,838
They're fascinating...

309
00:28:57,043 --> 00:28:59,352
like being inside a dream or something.

310
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,149
There's truth, but no logic.

311
00:29:01,297 --> 00:29:04,288
- What's the artist's name?
- Something Picasso.

312
00:29:04,508 --> 00:29:08,501
Something Picasso. He won't amount
to a thing. He won't, trust me.

313
00:29:08,762 --> 00:29:11,515
- Put the Degas in the bedroom.
- At least they were cheap.

314
00:29:12,307 --> 00:29:14,218
Put it in the wardrobe.

315
00:29:19,147 --> 00:29:23,299
At Cherbourg, a woman came aboard
named Margaret Brown.

316
00:29:23,819 --> 00:29:25,696
We all called her Molly.

317
00:29:25,988 --> 00:29:29,025
History would call her
the Unsinkable Molly Brown.

318
00:29:29,283 --> 00:29:31,843
I wasn't about to wait all day for you,
sonny.

319
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:34,231
Here, if you think you can manage.

320
00:29:34,413 --> 00:29:37,404
Her husband had struck gold,
someplace out west.

321
00:29:37,624 --> 00:29:40,583
And she was what mother called
"new money. "

322
00:29:42,003 --> 00:29:44,801
By the next afternoon,
we were steaming west...

323
00:29:45,006 --> 00:29:46,997
from the coast of Ireland...

324
00:29:47,175 --> 00:29:49,928
with nothing out ahead of us but ocean.

325
00:29:56,518 --> 00:30:00,636
Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch.
Let's stretch her legs.

326
00:30:01,189 --> 00:30:02,417
Yes, sir.

327
00:30:04,693 --> 00:30:07,412
- All ahead full, Mr. Moody.
- Very good, sir.

328
00:30:12,616 --> 00:30:14,096
All ahead full.

329
00:30:14,577 --> 00:30:16,329
All ahead full!

330
00:30:16,829 --> 00:30:18,626
Come on, lads, step lively.

331
00:30:25,379 --> 00:30:27,051
What's the reading?

332
00:30:36,724 --> 00:30:40,194
All right! Let's stoke her right up!
We go full ahead!

333
00:30:40,436 --> 00:30:42,312
Come on, right back to work.

334
00:31:37,326 --> 00:31:39,044
21 knots, sir.

335
00:31:48,085 --> 00:31:49,643
Hey, look!

336
00:31:52,298 --> 00:31:53,572
See it?

337
00:31:57,178 --> 00:31:59,328
There's another one. See him?

338
00:32:09,441 --> 00:32:11,830
Look at that one! Look at him jump!

339
00:32:37,218 --> 00:32:39,857
I can see the Statue of Liberty already.

340
00:32:40,346 --> 00:32:42,064
Very small, of course.

341
00:32:45,518 --> 00:32:48,078
I'm the king of the world!

342
00:33:34,441 --> 00:33:38,593
She's the largest moving object ever made
by the hand of man in all history.

343
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:44,262
And our master shipbuilder, Mr. Andrews,
here, designed her from the keel plates up.

344
00:33:44,534 --> 00:33:48,243
I may have knocked her together,
but the idea was Mr. Ismay's.

345
00:33:48,705 --> 00:33:51,663
He envisioned a steamer
so grand in scale...

346
00:33:51,917 --> 00:33:55,830
and so luxurious in its appointments that
its supremacy would never be challenged.

347
00:33:56,088 --> 00:33:59,683
And here she is, willed into solid reality.

348
00:33:59,925 --> 00:34:01,243
Hear, hear.

349
00:34:02,219 --> 00:34:03,891
The salmon.

350
00:34:06,931 --> 00:34:09,161
You know I don't like that, Rose.

351
00:34:12,854 --> 00:34:14,128
She knows.

352
00:34:16,941 --> 00:34:20,490
We'll both have the lamb.
Rare, with very little mint sauce.

353
00:34:21,904 --> 00:34:23,656
You like lamb, right, sweet pea?

354
00:34:23,823 --> 00:34:24,812
Sausage.

355
00:34:26,242 --> 00:34:28,676
You gonna cut her meat for her,
too, there, Cal?

356
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:33,469
Hey, who thought of the name Titanic?

357
00:34:34,459 --> 00:34:36,768
- Was it you, Bruce?
- Yes, actually.

358
00:34:37,671 --> 00:34:40,025
I wanted to convey sheer size.

359
00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:42,933
And size means stability, luxury...

360
00:34:43,509 --> 00:34:45,340
and above all, strength.

361
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:48,779
Do you know of Dr. Freud, Mr. Ismay?

362
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:51,334
His ideas about
the male preoccupation with size...

363
00:34:51,517 --> 00:34:53,872
might be of particular interest to you.

364
00:34:54,645 --> 00:34:56,442
What's gotten into you?

365
00:34:56,605 --> 00:34:57,799
Excuse me.

366
00:35:02,361 --> 00:35:03,794
I do apologize.

367
00:35:03,946 --> 00:35:06,779
She's a pistol, Cal.
Hope you can handle her.

368
00:35:07,033 --> 00:35:09,422
I may have to start minding
what she reads from now on...

369
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:10,972
won't I, Mrs. Brown?

370
00:35:11,204 --> 00:35:13,592
Freud, who is he? Is he a passenger?

371
00:35:26,051 --> 00:35:28,087
The ship is nice?

372
00:35:28,262 --> 00:35:29,820
Yeah, it's an Irish ship.

373
00:35:29,972 --> 00:35:31,291
Is English, no?

374
00:35:31,431 --> 00:35:34,070
No, it was built in Ireland.
15,000 Irishmen built this ship.

375
00:35:34,268 --> 00:35:36,657
Solid as a rock. Big Irish hands.

376
00:35:37,438 --> 00:35:38,917
Well, that's typical.

377
00:35:39,064 --> 00:35:41,817
First-class dogs come down here
to take a shit.

378
00:35:42,025 --> 00:35:44,699
Lets us know where we rank
in the scheme of things.

379
00:35:44,904 --> 00:35:46,621
Like we could forget.

380
00:35:48,031 --> 00:35:49,350
I'm Tommy Ryan.

381
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:50,889
- Jack Dawson.
- Hello.

382
00:35:51,034 --> 00:35:52,513
- Fabrizio.
- Hi.

383
00:35:53,536 --> 00:35:56,050
Do you make any money
with your drawings?

384
00:36:05,507 --> 00:36:07,020
Forget it, boyo.

385
00:36:07,884 --> 00:36:09,875
You'd as like have angels
fly out of your arse...

386
00:36:10,053 --> 00:36:12,282
as get next to the likes of her.

387
00:36:35,453 --> 00:36:38,843
I saw my whole life
as if I'd already lived it.

388
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:42,817
An endless parade of parties
and cotillions...

389
00:36:43,461 --> 00:36:45,372
yachts and polo matches.

390
00:36:46,089 --> 00:36:50,128
Always the same narrow people,
the same mindless chatter.

391
00:36:51,511 --> 00:36:54,502
I felt like I was standing at
a great precipice...

392
00:36:55,681 --> 00:36:57,751
with no one to pull me back.

393
00:36:58,267 --> 00:36:59,825
No one who cared...

394
00:37:00,352 --> 00:37:01,865
or even noticed.

395
00:38:53,214 --> 00:38:54,533
Don't do it.

396
00:38:55,091 --> 00:38:56,365
Stay back.

397
00:38:57,427 --> 00:38:59,179
Don't come any closer.

398
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:02,651
Come on. Just give me your hand,
I'll pull you back over.

399
00:39:02,849 --> 00:39:04,679
No! Stay where you are.

400
00:39:05,308 --> 00:39:06,628
I mean it.

401
00:39:07,269 --> 00:39:08,588
I'll let go.

402
00:39:19,907 --> 00:39:21,340
No, you won't.

403
00:39:22,743 --> 00:39:24,699
What do you mean, no I won't?

404
00:39:24,953 --> 00:39:28,787
Don't presume to tell me what I will
and will not do. You don't know me.

405
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:31,509
Well, you would have done it already.

406
00:39:31,877 --> 00:39:34,071
You're distracting me. Go away.

407
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:36,329
I can't. I'm involved now.

408
00:39:37,925 --> 00:39:40,677
You let go, and I'm going to have to
jump in there after you.

409
00:39:42,929 --> 00:39:44,408
Don't be absurd.

410
00:39:44,931 --> 00:39:47,399
- You'll be killed.
- I'm a good swimmer.

411
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,431
The fall alone will kill you.

412
00:39:49,603 --> 00:39:52,242
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't.

413
00:39:52,981 --> 00:39:54,972
To tell you the truth,
I'm a lot more concerned...

414
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:57,220
about that water being so cold.

415
00:40:04,826 --> 00:40:06,020
How cold?

416
00:40:06,161 --> 00:40:09,039
Freezing. Maybe a couple of degrees over.

417
00:40:14,252 --> 00:40:16,720
You ever... You ever been to Wisconsin?

418
00:40:20,591 --> 00:40:21,626
What?

419
00:40:21,843 --> 00:40:24,516
They have some of the coldest
winters around.

420
00:40:24,721 --> 00:40:27,076
I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls.

421
00:40:27,348 --> 00:40:30,385
I remember, when I was a kid,
me and my father...

422
00:40:30,643 --> 00:40:33,111
we went ice fishing out on Lake Wissota.

423
00:40:33,771 --> 00:40:37,446
- Ice fishing is, you know, where you-
- I know what ice fishing is.

424
00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:39,508
Sorry.

425
00:40:41,029 --> 00:40:44,226
You just seem like,
you know, kind of an indoor girl.

426
00:40:46,368 --> 00:40:47,595
Anyway, I...

427
00:40:48,702 --> 00:40:50,772
I fell through some thin ice.

428
00:40:50,955 --> 00:40:52,547
And I'm telling you...

429
00:40:53,874 --> 00:40:55,466
water that cold...

430
00:40:55,876 --> 00:40:57,707
like right down there...

431
00:40:58,379 --> 00:41:02,258
it hits you like a thousand knives
stabbing you all over your body.

432
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:05,848
You can't breathe. You can't think.

433
00:41:07,471 --> 00:41:10,065
Least, not about anything but the pain.

434
00:41:12,977 --> 00:41:16,606
Which is why I'm not looking forward
to jumping in there after you.

435
00:41:17,523 --> 00:41:18,956
Like I said...

436
00:41:19,941 --> 00:41:21,738
I don't have a choice.

437
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:28,602
I guess I'm kind of hoping you'll come back
over the rail...

438
00:41:28,825 --> 00:41:30,622
and get me off the hook here.

439
00:41:31,036 --> 00:41:32,469
You're crazy.

440
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,821
That's what everybody says...

441
00:41:37,417 --> 00:41:39,248
but with all due respect, miss...

442
00:41:39,419 --> 00:41:42,297
I'm not the one hanging off
the back of a ship here.

443
00:41:42,965 --> 00:41:44,159
Come on.

444
00:41:44,967 --> 00:41:46,559
Give me your hand.

445
00:41:47,094 --> 00:41:49,085
You don't want to do this.

446
00:42:04,819 --> 00:42:06,377
I'm Jack Dawson.

447
00:42:07,947 --> 00:42:09,824
Rose Dewitt Bukater.

448
00:42:09,991 --> 00:42:12,824
I'll have to get you to write that one down.

449
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,314
Come on.

450
00:42:20,793 --> 00:42:22,466
I got you. Come on.

451
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,573
Come on!

452
00:42:29,218 --> 00:42:30,617
Help, please!

453
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:36,676
- Please, help me!
- Listen to me. I've got you.

454
00:42:37,101 --> 00:42:38,580
I won't let go.

455
00:42:38,728 --> 00:42:40,844
Now pull yourself up. Come on!

456
00:42:43,775 --> 00:42:45,572
Come on. That's right.

457
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:47,752
You can do it.

458
00:42:52,325 --> 00:42:53,644
I got you.

459
00:42:59,331 --> 00:43:00,889
What's all this?

460
00:43:06,588 --> 00:43:09,182
You stand back! And don't move an inch!

461
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:13,198
Fetch the master-at-arms.

462
00:43:15,347 --> 00:43:17,577
This is completely unacceptable.

463
00:43:17,975 --> 00:43:21,490
What made you think you could
put your hands on my fiancée?

464
00:43:22,021 --> 00:43:23,613
Look at me, you filth!

465
00:43:23,773 --> 00:43:25,809
- Cal.
- What do you think you were doing?

466
00:43:25,983 --> 00:43:28,098
Cal, stop. It was an accident.

467
00:43:29,361 --> 00:43:30,714
An accident?

468
00:43:31,446 --> 00:43:32,596
It was.

469
00:43:33,865 --> 00:43:35,264
Stupid, really.

470
00:43:35,408 --> 00:43:37,683
I was leaning over and I slipped.

471
00:43:40,413 --> 00:43:42,927
I was leaning far over to see the...

472
00:43:47,879 --> 00:43:49,995
- Propellers?
- Propellers, and I slipped.

473
00:43:50,173 --> 00:43:53,848
And I would have gone overboard,
but Mr. Dawson here saved me.

474
00:43:54,261 --> 00:43:56,411
And almost went over himself.

475
00:43:57,014 --> 00:43:58,811
She wanted to see the propellers.

476
00:43:58,974 --> 00:44:01,772
Like I said,
women and machinery do not mix.

477
00:44:02,811 --> 00:44:04,642
Was that the way of it?

478
00:44:07,399 --> 00:44:09,514
Yeah, that was pretty much it.

479
00:44:09,692 --> 00:44:12,604
Well, the boy's a hero, then.
Good for you, son. Well done.

480
00:44:13,071 --> 00:44:15,869
So, it's all's well and back to our brandy?

481
00:44:17,325 --> 00:44:20,715
Look at you. You must be freezing.
Let's get you inside.

482
00:44:21,955 --> 00:44:24,549
Perhaps a little something for the boy?

483
00:44:26,543 --> 00:44:27,817
Of course.

484
00:44:28,336 --> 00:44:29,689
Mr. Lovejoy...

485
00:44:29,838 --> 00:44:31,988
I think $20 should do it.

486
00:44:32,424 --> 00:44:35,621
Is that the going rate
for saving the woman you love?

487
00:44:36,553 --> 00:44:38,225
Rose is displeased.

488
00:44:39,014 --> 00:44:40,332
What to do?

489
00:44:41,098 --> 00:44:42,213
I know.

490
00:44:44,435 --> 00:44:47,711
Perhaps you could join us
for dinner tomorrow evening.

491
00:44:48,564 --> 00:44:51,795
To regale our group with your heroic tale.

492
00:44:54,779 --> 00:44:56,451
Sure. Count me in.

493
00:44:57,114 --> 00:44:58,945
Good. It's settled then.

494
00:45:00,451 --> 00:45:02,487
This should be interesting.

495
00:45:11,004 --> 00:45:13,153
Can I bum a smoke?

496
00:45:22,681 --> 00:45:24,637
You'll want to tie those.

497
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,597
It's interesting.
The young lady slipped so suddenly...

498
00:45:29,855 --> 00:45:33,325
and you still had time to remove
your jacket and your shoes.

499
00:45:49,374 --> 00:45:51,524
I know you've been melancholy.

500
00:45:52,752 --> 00:45:54,743
I don't pretend to know why.

501
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:59,251
I intended to save this...

502
00:45:59,509 --> 00:46:04,105
until the engagement gala next week.

503
00:46:05,849 --> 00:46:10,001
But I thought, tonight.

504
00:46:11,063 --> 00:46:12,462
Good gracious!

505
00:46:13,023 --> 00:46:16,095
Perhaps as a reminder
of my feelings for you.

506
00:46:16,652 --> 00:46:18,528
- Is it a-
- Diamond? Yes.

507
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,669
56 carats to be exact.

508
00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:28,280
It was worn by Louis XVl.

509
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:31,719
And they called it Le Coeur de la Mer.

510
00:46:31,916 --> 00:46:35,226
- The Heart of the Ocean.
- The Heart of the Ocean. Yes.

511
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,188
It's overwhelming.

512
00:46:42,552 --> 00:46:44,349
It's for royalty.

513
00:46:45,555 --> 00:46:47,306
We are royalty, Rose.

514
00:46:51,728 --> 00:46:54,605
You know, there is nothing
I couldn't give you.

515
00:46:54,897 --> 00:46:56,933
There is nothing I'd deny you...

516
00:46:57,483 --> 00:46:59,314
if you would not deny me.

517
00:47:03,906 --> 00:47:05,976
Open your heart to me, Rose.

518
00:47:21,924 --> 00:47:24,154
I've been on my own since I was 15.

519
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:26,015
Since my folks died.

520
00:47:26,887 --> 00:47:30,596
And I had no brothers or sisters
or close kin in that part of the country.

521
00:47:31,141 --> 00:47:33,974
So I lit on out of there
and I haven't been back since.

522
00:47:34,186 --> 00:47:37,417
You can just call me
a tumbleweed blowing in the wind.

523
00:47:39,566 --> 00:47:43,400
Well, Rose, we've walked
about a mile around this boat deck...

524
00:47:44,321 --> 00:47:47,518
chewed over how great
the weather's been and how I grew up...

525
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:51,465
but I reckon that's not
why you came to talk to me, is it?

526
00:47:52,788 --> 00:47:54,460
- Mr. Dawson, I-
- Jack.

527
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:56,897
Jack...

528
00:47:57,418 --> 00:47:59,885
I want to thank you for what you did.

529
00:48:01,129 --> 00:48:03,848
Not just for pulling me back...

530
00:48:04,591 --> 00:48:07,264
- but for your discretion.
- You're welcome.

531
00:48:08,011 --> 00:48:09,160
Look...

532
00:48:09,846 --> 00:48:12,155
I know what you must be thinking:

533
00:48:12,766 --> 00:48:16,076
"Poor little rich girl.
What does she know about misery?"

534
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:17,919
No.

535
00:48:19,439 --> 00:48:20,997
That's not what I was thinking.

536
00:48:21,483 --> 00:48:22,916
What I was thinking was...

537
00:48:23,068 --> 00:48:26,743
what could have happened to this girl
to make her think she had no way out?

538
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:29,892
Well, I...

539
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:32,265
It was everything.

540
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:35,561
It was my whole world
and all the people in it.

541
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:38,033
And the inertia of my life...

542
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:41,297
plunging ahead,
and me, powerless to stop it.

543
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:44,005
God, look at that thing.

544
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,814
You'd have gone straight to the bottom.

545
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,936
Five hundred invitations have gone out.

546
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:53,810
All of Philadelphia society will be there.

547
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:56,324
And all the while, I feel...

548
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:58,712
I'm standing in the middle of
a crowded room...

549
00:48:58,895 --> 00:49:01,853
screaming at the top of my lungs,
and no one even looks up.

550
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:04,954
Do you love him?

551
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,095
Pardon me?

552
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:08,749
Do you love him?

553
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:12,430
You're being very rude.
You shouldn't be asking me this.

554
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:15,775
It's a simple question.
Do you love the guy or not?

555
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,535
This is not a suitable conversation.

556
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:22,267
Why can't you just answer the question?

557
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,148
This is absurd.

558
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,176
You don't know me and I don't know you...

559
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:29,773
and we are not having
this conversation at all.

560
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:32,765
You are rude and uncouth
and presumptuous...

561
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,323
and I am leaving now.

562
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:37,031
Jack, Mr. Dawson, it's been a pleasure.

563
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,613
I sought you out to thank you
and now I have thanked you-

564
00:49:39,809 --> 00:49:41,606
And you've insulted me.

565
00:49:41,811 --> 00:49:43,369
Well, you deserved it.

566
00:49:43,521 --> 00:49:44,954
- Right.
- Right.

567
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:50,256
- I thought you were leaving.
- I am.

568
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,833
You are so annoying.

569
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:58,059
Wait, I don't have to leave.

570
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,839
This is my part of the ship. You leave.

571
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:04,342
Well, well, well! Now who's being rude?

572
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:11,750
What is this stupid thing
you're carrying around?

573
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,439
So, what are you, an artist or something?

574
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:21,187
These are rather good.

575
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:27,110
They're very good, actually.

576
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,609
Jack, this is exquisite work.

577
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:39,502
They didn't think too much
of them in old Paree.

578
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:40,771
Paris?

579
00:50:42,162 --> 00:50:44,313
You do get around for a...

580
00:50:47,668 --> 00:50:49,704
A person of limited means.

581
00:50:49,879 --> 00:50:52,154
Go on, a poor guy. You can say it.

582
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,318
Well, well, well.

583
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:04,253
And these were drawn from life?

584
00:51:07,146 --> 00:51:09,216
That's one of the good things about Paris.

585
00:51:09,398 --> 00:51:12,355
Lots of girls willing to take
their clothes off.

586
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,409
You liked this woman.

587
00:51:19,742 --> 00:51:21,732
You used her several times.

588
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:27,139
She had beautiful hands, you see?

589
00:51:29,501 --> 00:51:31,571
I think you must have had
a love affair with her.

590
00:51:31,754 --> 00:51:33,984
No. Just with her hands.

591
00:51:34,631 --> 00:51:36,906
She was a one-legged prostitute.

592
00:51:38,344 --> 00:51:39,333
See?

593
00:51:45,726 --> 00:51:48,285
She had a good sense of humor, though.

594
00:51:50,355 --> 00:51:52,028
And this lady...

595
00:51:53,108 --> 00:51:55,542
she used to sit at this bar every night...

596
00:51:55,735 --> 00:51:58,249
wearing every piece of jewelry
she owned...

597
00:51:58,446 --> 00:52:00,880
just waiting for her long lost love.

598
00:52:01,491 --> 00:52:03,527
We called her Madame Bijoux.

599
00:52:04,035 --> 00:52:06,469
See, her clothes are all moth-eaten.

600
00:52:07,789 --> 00:52:09,939
Well, you have a gift, Jack.

601
00:52:10,876 --> 00:52:11,991
You do.

602
00:52:12,711 --> 00:52:15,430
- You see people.
- I see you.

603
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:19,084
And?

604
00:52:20,969 --> 00:52:22,925
You wouldn't have jumped.

605
00:52:26,892 --> 00:52:30,440
But the purpose of university
is to find a suitable husband.

606
00:52:30,853 --> 00:52:32,809
Rose has already done that.

607
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:35,653
Look, here comes that vulgar
Brown woman.

608
00:52:35,983 --> 00:52:38,622
Quickly, get up before she sits with us.

609
00:52:39,821 --> 00:52:42,335
Hello, girls.
I was hoping I'd catch you at tea.

610
00:52:42,532 --> 00:52:44,602
We're awfully sorry. You missed it.

611
00:52:44,784 --> 00:52:47,742
The Countess and I were just off
to take the air on the boat deck.

612
00:52:47,954 --> 00:52:51,105
What a lovely idea.
I need to catch up on my gossip.

613
00:52:54,461 --> 00:52:55,689
Countess.

614
00:52:57,254 --> 00:52:59,927
You've not yet lit the last four boilers?

615
00:53:00,424 --> 00:53:02,301
No, I don't see the need.

616
00:53:02,468 --> 00:53:04,504
We are making excellent time.

617
00:53:05,262 --> 00:53:07,173
The press knows the size of Titanic.

618
00:53:07,348 --> 00:53:09,657
Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.

619
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:12,489
We must give them
something new to print.

620
00:53:14,188 --> 00:53:17,305
This maiden voyage of Titanic
must make headlines.

621
00:53:18,609 --> 00:53:20,008
Mr. Ismay...

622
00:53:20,903 --> 00:53:25,215
I would prefer not to push the engines
until they've been properly run in.

623
00:53:26,284 --> 00:53:27,717
Of course, I'm just a passenger.

624
00:53:27,869 --> 00:53:30,507
I leave it to your good offices
to decide what's best.

625
00:53:30,704 --> 00:53:33,298
But what a glorious end
to your final crossing...

626
00:53:33,499 --> 00:53:36,774
if we were to get into New York
on Tuesday night and surprise them all.

627
00:53:37,002 --> 00:53:38,879
Make the morning papers.

628
00:53:39,046 --> 00:53:41,196
Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?

629
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:46,238
Good man.

630
00:53:47,304 --> 00:53:49,864
After that, I worked on a squid boat
in Monterey...

631
00:53:50,682 --> 00:53:53,355
then I went down to Los Angeles
to the pier in Santa Monica...

632
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:56,836
and started doing portraits there
for 10 cents apiece.

633
00:53:57,231 --> 00:53:59,267
Why can't I be like you, Jack?

634
00:53:59,441 --> 00:54:02,716
Just head out for the horizon
whenever I feel like it.

635
00:54:04,822 --> 00:54:07,619
Say we'll go there sometime, to that pier...

636
00:54:07,825 --> 00:54:10,338
even if we only ever just talk about it.

637
00:54:10,535 --> 00:54:13,208
No, we'll do it. We'll drink cheap beer...

638
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:16,458
we'll ride on the roller coaster
till we throw up.

639
00:54:16,666 --> 00:54:19,738
Then we'll ride horses on the beach,
right in the surf.

640
00:54:19,961 --> 00:54:23,954
But you'll have to do it like a real cowboy,
none of that sidesaddle stuff.

641
00:54:24,466 --> 00:54:26,980
- You mean, one leg on each side?
- Yeah.

642
00:54:28,678 --> 00:54:31,112
- Can you show me?
- Sure, if you like.

643
00:54:33,225 --> 00:54:35,056
Teach me to ride like a man.

644
00:54:35,227 --> 00:54:37,103
And chew tobacco like a man.

645
00:54:37,895 --> 00:54:39,773
And spit like a man.

646
00:54:39,939 --> 00:54:42,328
What, they didn't teach you that
in finishing school?

647
00:54:42,525 --> 00:54:43,514
No.

648
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:46,434
Come on, I'll show you. Let's do it.

649
00:54:46,612 --> 00:54:47,965
I'll show you how, come on.

650
00:54:48,114 --> 00:54:49,911
- Jack, no.
- Come on.

651
00:54:50,074 --> 00:54:51,951
- No. Wait, Jack.
- Come on.

652
00:54:52,368 --> 00:54:54,598
No, Jack. I couldn't possibly, Jack.

653
00:54:54,787 --> 00:54:56,220
Watch closely.

654
00:54:58,332 --> 00:54:59,924
That's disgusting.

655
00:55:00,251 --> 00:55:01,969
All right, your turn.

656
00:55:03,338 --> 00:55:05,772
That was pitiful.
Come on, you really gotta hawk it back.

657
00:55:05,965 --> 00:55:08,524
Get some leverage to it, use your arms...

658
00:55:08,718 --> 00:55:10,151
arc your neck.

659
00:55:11,011 --> 00:55:13,241
You see the range on that thing?

660
00:55:13,847 --> 00:55:15,280
Okay, go.

661
00:55:18,519 --> 00:55:20,714
- That was better. You got to work on it.
- Really?

662
00:55:20,896 --> 00:55:24,605
Really try to hawk it up
and get some body to it. You gotta...

663
00:55:31,657 --> 00:55:32,806
Mother.

664
00:55:38,205 --> 00:55:40,275
May I introduce Jack Dawson?

665
00:55:41,834 --> 00:55:43,472
Charmed, I'm sure.

666
00:55:48,256 --> 00:55:50,611
The others were gracious and curious...

667
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,109
about the man who'd saved my life.

668
00:55:54,346 --> 00:55:57,065
But my mother looked at him
like an insect.

669
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:01,308
A dangerous insect
which must be squashed quickly.

670
00:56:02,145 --> 00:56:06,138
Jack, sounds like you're a good man
to have around in a sticky spot.

671
00:56:08,819 --> 00:56:11,128
Why do they always insist on
announcing dinner...

672
00:56:11,321 --> 00:56:13,311
like a damn cavalry charge?

673
00:56:13,782 --> 00:56:15,772
Shall we go dress, Mother?

674
00:56:16,535 --> 00:56:18,411
See you at dinner, Jack.

675
00:56:20,496 --> 00:56:21,531
Son?

676
00:56:21,874 --> 00:56:22,908
Son!

677
00:56:23,708 --> 00:56:26,905
Do you have the slightest comprehension
of what you're doing?

678
00:56:27,128 --> 00:56:28,163
Not really.

679
00:56:28,296 --> 00:56:30,764
You're about to go into the snake pit.

680
00:56:33,051 --> 00:56:35,201
What are you planning to wear?

681
00:56:37,972 --> 00:56:39,644
I figured. Come on.

682
00:56:42,477 --> 00:56:43,956
I was right.

683
00:56:44,521 --> 00:56:46,909
You and my son
are just about the same size.

684
00:56:47,107 --> 00:56:48,505
Pretty close.

685
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:54,686
You shine up like a new penny.

686
00:57:06,751 --> 00:57:08,343
Good evening, sir.

687
00:58:12,399 --> 00:58:15,516
There are several thousand tons
of Hockley steel in this very ship.

688
00:58:15,735 --> 00:58:17,930
- Which part?
- All the right ones, of course.

689
00:58:18,113 --> 00:58:20,502
Then we'll know who to hold accountable
if there's a problem.

690
00:58:20,699 --> 00:58:22,849
- Where's my daughter?
- She'll be along.

691
00:58:23,035 --> 00:58:24,787
There is the Countess.

692
00:58:24,995 --> 00:58:26,747
- Hello, my dear.
- Good evening, Cal.

693
00:58:26,913 --> 00:58:28,709
So good to see you.

694
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:57,819
I saw that in a nickelodeon once
and I always wanted to do it.

695
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:11,585
I'll see you at dinner.

696
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,273
Darling...

697
00:59:13,709 --> 00:59:15,904
surely you remember Mr. Dawson.

698
00:59:16,378 --> 00:59:17,572
Dawson.

699
00:59:18,672 --> 00:59:20,151
That's amazing.

700
00:59:20,591 --> 00:59:23,105
You could almost pass for a gentleman.

701
00:59:23,552 --> 00:59:24,746
Almost.

702
00:59:24,887 --> 00:59:26,605
Extraordinary.

703
00:59:38,358 --> 00:59:40,952
My dear, it's delightful to see you.

704
00:59:41,194 --> 00:59:42,468
What a remarkable voyage this is.

705
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:45,080
- It's mad, isn't it?
- Completely lunatic.

706
00:59:46,199 --> 00:59:48,429
There's the Countess of Rothes.

707
00:59:51,413 --> 00:59:53,563
And that's John Jacob Astor...

708
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:55,675
the richest man on the ship.

709
00:59:55,834 --> 00:59:59,668
His little wifey there, Madeleine,
is my age, and in a delicate condition.

710
01:00:00,672 --> 01:00:02,424
See how she's trying to hide it?

711
01:00:02,591 --> 01:00:04,149
Quite the scandal.

712
01:00:04,718 --> 01:00:08,108
And that's Benjamin Guggenheim
and his mistress, Madame Aubert.

713
01:00:08,346 --> 01:00:11,463
Mrs. Guggenheim is at home
with the children, of course.

714
01:00:11,684 --> 01:00:15,073
And over here, we have Sir Cosmo
and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon.

715
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:18,542
She designs naughty lingerie,
among her many talents.

716
01:00:19,023 --> 01:00:21,139
Very popular with the royals.

717
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:24,544
Congratulations, Hockley. She's splendid.

718
01:00:24,738 --> 01:00:26,171
Why, thank you.

719
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:29,618
- Care to escort a lady to dinner?
- Certainly.

720
01:00:31,328 --> 01:00:32,807
Sweet pea?

721
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:37,117
Ain't nothing to it, is there, Jack?
Remember, they love money.

722
01:00:37,334 --> 01:00:40,451
So just pretend like you own a gold mine
and you're in the club.

723
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:44,317
Hey, Astor.

724
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:47,738
Hello, Molly, nice to see you.

725
01:00:48,386 --> 01:00:50,900
J.J., Madeleine,
I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.

726
01:00:51,097 --> 01:00:52,530
- How do you do?
- Pleasure.

727
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:54,115
Well, Jack...

728
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,716
are you of the Boston Dawsons?

729
01:00:57,270 --> 01:00:59,864
No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.

730
01:01:00,064 --> 01:01:01,213
Oh, yes.

731
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:06,476
He must have been nervous,
but he never faltered.

732
01:01:08,156 --> 01:01:10,306
They assumed he was one of them.

733
01:01:10,491 --> 01:01:13,085
Heir to a railroad fortune, perhaps.

734
01:01:14,245 --> 01:01:17,475
New money, obviously,
but still a member of the club.

735
01:01:19,082 --> 01:01:22,119
Mother, of course,
could always be counted upon.

736
01:01:23,128 --> 01:01:26,086
Tell us of the accommodations
in steerage, Mr. Dawson.

737
01:01:26,298 --> 01:01:28,016
I hear they're quite good on this ship.

738
01:01:29,551 --> 01:01:32,304
The best I've seen, ma'am. Hardly any rats.

739
01:01:35,766 --> 01:01:38,485
Mr. Dawson is joining us
from the third class.

740
01:01:38,686 --> 01:01:41,075
He was of some assistance
to my fiancée last night.

741
01:01:41,272 --> 01:01:44,025
It turns out that Mr. Dawson
is quite a fine artist.

742
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:47,225
He was kind enough to show me
some of his work today.

743
01:01:47,445 --> 01:01:50,437
Rose and I differ somewhat
in our definition of fine art.

744
01:01:50,656 --> 01:01:52,725
Not to impugn your work, sir.

745
01:02:03,126 --> 01:02:04,320
Are these all for me?

746
01:02:04,461 --> 01:02:06,452
Just start from the outside
and work your way in.

747
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:08,905
He knows every rivet in her,
don't you, Thomas?

748
01:02:09,091 --> 01:02:11,559
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.

749
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,273
Thank you, Rose.

750
01:02:16,306 --> 01:02:17,785
How do you take your caviar, sir?

751
01:02:17,933 --> 01:02:19,729
No caviar for me, thanks.

752
01:02:19,893 --> 01:02:21,724
Never did like it much.

753
01:02:23,105 --> 01:02:25,777
And where exactly do you live,
Mr. Dawson?

754
01:02:26,065 --> 01:02:28,863
Right now, my address is the RMS Titanic.

755
01:02:29,652 --> 01:02:31,802
After that, I'm on God's good humor.

756
01:02:31,988 --> 01:02:34,548
And how is it you have means to travel?

757
01:02:34,741 --> 01:02:36,857
I work my way from place to place.

758
01:02:37,035 --> 01:02:39,230
You know, tramp steamers and such.

759
01:02:39,412 --> 01:02:42,802
But I won my ticket on Titanic here
at a lucky hand at poker.

760
01:02:43,082 --> 01:02:44,674
A very lucky hand.

761
01:02:45,502 --> 01:02:47,538
All life is a game of luck.

762
01:02:48,838 --> 01:02:51,671
A real man makes his own luck, Archie.
Right, Dawson?

763
01:02:53,301 --> 01:02:57,009
And you find that sort
of rootless existence appealing, do you?

764
01:03:00,224 --> 01:03:01,816
Yes, ma'am, I do.

765
01:03:02,518 --> 01:03:05,635
I mean, I've got everything I need
right here with me.

766
01:03:05,855 --> 01:03:09,165
I got air in my lungs
and a few blank sheets of paper.

767
01:03:09,942 --> 01:03:13,139
I love waking up in the morning
not knowing what's gonna happen...

768
01:03:13,613 --> 01:03:15,410
or who I'm gonna meet...

769
01:03:15,573 --> 01:03:17,291
where I'm gonna wind up.

770
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:20,089
Just the other night I was sleeping
under a bridge, and now...

771
01:03:20,286 --> 01:03:22,436
here I am
on the grandest ship in the world...

772
01:03:22,622 --> 01:03:24,260
having champagne with you fine people.

773
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:26,212
I'll take some more of that.

774
01:03:26,709 --> 01:03:30,223
I figure life is a gift
and I don't intend on wasting it.

775
01:03:30,838 --> 01:03:33,432
You never know what hand
you're gonna get dealt next.

776
01:03:33,632 --> 01:03:35,782
You learn to take life as it comes at you.

777
01:03:35,968 --> 01:03:37,481
Here you go, Cal.

778
01:03:39,012 --> 01:03:40,809
To make each day count.

779
01:03:41,598 --> 01:03:43,714
- Well said, Jack.
- Hear, hear.

780
01:03:44,893 --> 01:03:46,611
To making it count.

781
01:03:47,896 --> 01:03:49,568
To making it count!

782
01:03:50,274 --> 01:03:51,423
Bravo.

783
01:03:57,865 --> 01:04:01,414
But Mr. Brown had no idea
I'd hidden the money in the stove.

784
01:04:02,869 --> 01:04:06,783
So he comes home drunk as a pig,
celebrating, and he lights a fire.

785
01:04:09,626 --> 01:04:10,661
Bravo.

786
01:04:10,794 --> 01:04:13,433
Next it'll be brandies in the smoking room.

787
01:04:15,048 --> 01:04:18,040
- Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?
- What a good idea.

788
01:04:18,718 --> 01:04:21,869
Now they retreat into a cloud of smoke
and congratulate each other...

789
01:04:22,097 --> 01:04:23,689
on being masters of the universe.

790
01:04:23,849 --> 01:04:26,727
Ladies, thank you for the pleasure
of your company.

791
01:04:26,935 --> 01:04:28,493
Rose, may I escort you to the cabin?

792
01:04:28,645 --> 01:04:30,317
No, I'll stay here.

793
01:04:30,605 --> 01:04:32,277
Here you go, Molly.

794
01:04:32,857 --> 01:04:34,576
Joining us, Dawson?

795
01:04:34,734 --> 01:04:37,931
You don't want to stay out here
with the women, do you?

796
01:04:38,154 --> 01:04:41,430
- No, thanks, I've got to be heading back.
- Probably best.

797
01:04:41,657 --> 01:04:44,046
It'll be all business and politics,
that sort of thing.

798
01:04:44,243 --> 01:04:46,040
Wouldn't interest you.

799
01:04:46,287 --> 01:04:47,686
But, Dawson...

800
01:04:48,164 --> 01:04:49,882
good of you to come.

801
01:04:54,587 --> 01:04:56,020
Jack, must you go?

802
01:04:56,172 --> 01:04:58,970
Time for me to go row
with the other slaves.

803
01:05:01,845 --> 01:05:03,437
Good night, Rose.

804
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:45,705
So you want to go to a real party?

805
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:58,874
Is okay if I put my hand here? Okay.

806
01:06:14,124 --> 01:06:15,193
What?

807
01:06:17,961 --> 01:06:19,758
I can't understand you.

808
01:06:52,286 --> 01:06:54,720
I'm going to dance with her now, all right?

809
01:06:54,914 --> 01:06:56,063
Come on.

810
01:06:56,207 --> 01:06:57,640
- What?
- Come on.

811
01:06:57,792 --> 01:07:00,101
- Come with me.
- Jack! Jack, wait.

812
01:07:02,922 --> 01:07:04,116
I can't do this.

813
01:07:04,257 --> 01:07:07,567
We're gonna have to get
a little bit closer, like this.

814
01:07:10,596 --> 01:07:12,871
You're still my best girl, Cora.

815
01:07:15,727 --> 01:07:18,878
- I don't know the steps.
- Neither do I, just go with it.

816
01:07:19,105 --> 01:07:20,458
Don't think.

817
01:07:39,583 --> 01:07:42,222
Wait, Jack! Stop!

818
01:07:52,095 --> 01:07:53,495
Stop! Wait!

819
01:08:34,971 --> 01:08:36,643
Jack, no.

820
01:08:42,687 --> 01:08:44,678
...beyond the jurisdiction
of the Sherman Act.

821
01:08:44,856 --> 01:08:46,494
So my lawyers will argue.

822
01:08:46,649 --> 01:08:50,005
That's what Rockefeller said, but
the Supreme Court is not swallowing it.

823
01:09:10,381 --> 01:09:11,450
What?

824
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:14,263
You think a first-class girl can't drink?

825
01:09:16,512 --> 01:09:18,025
Get out of here.

826
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:19,738
You all right?

827
01:09:21,434 --> 01:09:22,549
I'm fine.

828
01:09:22,685 --> 01:09:24,243
Two out of three.

829
01:09:25,771 --> 01:09:26,806
So...

830
01:09:28,149 --> 01:09:30,379
you think you're big tough men?

831
01:09:31,402 --> 01:09:33,198
Let's see you do this.

832
01:09:35,113 --> 01:09:37,502
Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.

833
01:09:55,467 --> 01:09:57,185
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

834
01:09:57,344 --> 01:10:00,381
- Are you all right?
- I haven't done that in years.

835
01:10:36,758 --> 01:10:38,111
Coffee, sir?

836
01:10:48,102 --> 01:10:50,616
I had hoped you would come to me
last night.

837
01:10:51,939 --> 01:10:53,258
I was tired.

838
01:10:56,194 --> 01:10:59,504
Your exertions below decks were,
no doubt, exhausting.

839
01:11:01,658 --> 01:11:05,492
I see you had that undertaker
of a manservant follow me. How typical.

840
01:11:05,745 --> 01:11:09,499
You will never behave like that again,
Rose, do you understand?

841
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,549
I'm not a foreman in one of your mills
that you can command.

842
01:11:16,713 --> 01:11:18,271
I'm your fiancée.

843
01:11:21,051 --> 01:11:22,609
My fiancée!

844
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:24,923
Yes, you are, and my wife!

845
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:29,720
My wife in practice, if not yet by law.
So you will honor me.

846
01:11:30,394 --> 01:11:33,386
You'll honor me the way a wife is required
to honor her husband.

847
01:11:33,606 --> 01:11:36,325
Because I will not be made
out a fool, Rose.

848
01:11:36,525 --> 01:11:38,516
Is this in any way unclear?

849
01:11:39,403 --> 01:11:40,392
No.

850
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:43,135
Good. Excuse me.

851
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:50,145
Miss Rose.

852
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:54,600
- We had a little accident.
- That's all right, Miss Rose.

853
01:11:54,793 --> 01:11:56,385
- Sorry, Trudy.
- It's all right.

854
01:11:56,545 --> 01:11:57,819
Let me help you.

855
01:11:57,963 --> 01:11:59,681
It's all right, miss.

856
01:12:05,804 --> 01:12:07,203
It's all right, miss.

857
01:12:13,187 --> 01:12:15,576
- Tea, Trudy.
- Yes, ma'am.

858
01:12:31,871 --> 01:12:35,022
You are not to see that boy again.
Do you understand me?

859
01:12:36,376 --> 01:12:38,651
Rose, I forbid it.

860
01:12:39,754 --> 01:12:42,871
Stop it, Mother.
You'll give yourself a nosebleed.

861
01:12:43,091 --> 01:12:44,763
This is not a game.

862
01:12:45,302 --> 01:12:47,372
Our situation is precarious.

863
01:12:47,554 --> 01:12:49,033
You know the money's gone.

864
01:12:49,181 --> 01:12:51,217
Of course I know it's gone.

865
01:12:51,807 --> 01:12:53,685
You remind me every day.

866
01:12:54,518 --> 01:12:59,069
Your father left us nothing but a legacy
of bad debts hidden by a good name.

867
01:12:59,774 --> 01:13:02,493
That name is the only card
we have to play.

868
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:04,941
I don't understand you.

869
01:13:05,321 --> 01:13:08,996
It is a fine match with Hockley.
It will ensure our survival.

870
01:13:10,785 --> 01:13:12,662
How can you put this on my shoulders?

871
01:13:12,829 --> 01:13:14,547
Why are you being so selfish?

872
01:13:14,705 --> 01:13:16,297
I'm being selfish?

873
01:13:19,919 --> 01:13:22,797
Do you want to see me working
as a seamstress?

874
01:13:24,674 --> 01:13:26,470
Is that what you want?

875
01:13:29,052 --> 01:13:31,646
To see our fine things sold at auction?

876
01:13:33,682 --> 01:13:36,071
Our memories scattered to the winds?

877
01:13:46,654 --> 01:13:48,212
It's so unfair.

878
01:13:49,949 --> 01:13:51,826
Of course it's unfair.

879
01:13:52,910 --> 01:13:54,229
We're women.

880
01:13:56,831 --> 01:13:58,867
Our choices are never easy.

881
01:14:20,604 --> 01:14:24,677
Protect them by Thy guiding hand

882
01:14:24,941 --> 01:14:29,696
From every peril on the land

883
01:14:31,573 --> 01:14:35,963
O spirit whom the Father sent

884
01:14:36,410 --> 01:14:40,369
To spread abroad the firmament

885
01:14:40,915 --> 01:14:45,147
O wind of heaven, by Thy might

886
01:14:45,586 --> 01:14:50,137
Save all who dare the eagle's flight

887
01:14:50,675 --> 01:14:54,429
And keep them by Thy watchful

888
01:14:57,390 --> 01:14:59,699
- Hello, Mr. Andrews.
- Hello, Jack.

889
01:15:08,859 --> 01:15:10,690
I just need to talk to somebody
for a second.

890
01:15:10,862 --> 01:15:14,217
- Sir, you're not supposed to be in here.
- I just need to speak to someone.

891
01:15:17,451 --> 01:15:19,362
I was just here last night,
you don't remember me?

892
01:15:19,537 --> 01:15:20,572
No, I'm afraid I don't.

893
01:15:20,704 --> 01:15:23,172
- Now, you're gonna have to turn around.
- He'll tell you.

894
01:15:23,374 --> 01:15:24,727
I just need to talk-

895
01:15:24,875 --> 01:15:27,594
Mr. Hockley and Mrs. Dewitt Bukater...

896
01:15:28,421 --> 01:15:31,015
continue to be appreciative
of your assistance.

897
01:15:31,465 --> 01:15:34,901
They asked me to give you this
in gratitude.

898
01:15:35,136 --> 01:15:36,808
I don't want your money. Please. I just-

899
01:15:36,971 --> 01:15:40,087
Also to remind you
that you hold a third-class ticket...

900
01:15:40,308 --> 01:15:43,060
and that your presence here
is no longer appropriate.

901
01:15:43,268 --> 01:15:45,304
Please, I just wanna speak to Rose
for one second.

902
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:49,188
Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawson
gets back to where he belongs...

903
01:15:49,441 --> 01:15:51,318
and that he stays there.

904
01:15:51,777 --> 01:15:53,768
Yes, sir. Come along, you.

905
01:15:56,323 --> 01:15:58,962
Hear us when we cry to Thee

906
01:15:59,368 --> 01:16:04,158
For those in peril on the sea

907
01:16:05,332 --> 01:16:07,288
And why do you have
two steering wheels?

908
01:16:07,459 --> 01:16:09,893
- We really only use this near shore.
- Excuse me, sir.

909
01:16:10,087 --> 01:16:12,647
Another ice warning.
This one is from the Noordam.

910
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,477
Thank you, Sparks.

911
01:16:16,467 --> 01:16:19,937
Not to worry.
Quite normal for this time of year.

912
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:24,434
In fact, we're speeding up.
I've just ordered the last boilers lit.

913
01:16:28,730 --> 01:16:31,767
Okay, son, wind it up tight
like I showed you. That's right.

914
01:16:31,983 --> 01:16:33,701
Okay, now, let it go.

915
01:16:39,908 --> 01:16:41,500
That's excellent.

916
01:16:45,746 --> 01:16:48,215
Mr. Andrews, forgive me...

917
01:16:49,251 --> 01:16:51,127
I did the sum in my head...

918
01:16:51,294 --> 01:16:55,082
and with the number of lifeboats
times the capacity you mentioned...

919
01:16:55,339 --> 01:16:59,093
Forgive me, but it seems that there are
not enough for everyone aboard.

920
01:16:59,343 --> 01:17:01,061
About half, actually.

921
01:17:01,888 --> 01:17:04,083
Rose, you miss nothing, do you?

922
01:17:04,265 --> 01:17:06,654
In fact, I put in these new-type davits...

923
01:17:06,851 --> 01:17:09,968
which can take an extra row of boats
inside this one.

924
01:17:10,188 --> 01:17:12,338
But it was thought, by some...

925
01:17:12,523 --> 01:17:14,354
the deck would look too cluttered.

926
01:17:14,526 --> 01:17:16,198
So, I was overruled.

927
01:17:16,945 --> 01:17:20,096
It's a waste of deck space as it is
in an unsinkable ship.

928
01:17:20,323 --> 01:17:22,119
Sleep soundly, young Rose.

929
01:17:22,283 --> 01:17:25,080
I have built you a good ship,
strong and true.

930
01:17:25,286 --> 01:17:27,082
She's all the lifeboat you need.

931
01:17:27,246 --> 01:17:30,318
Keep heading aft.
The next stop will be the engine room.

932
01:17:30,541 --> 01:17:31,690
Come on.

933
01:17:36,922 --> 01:17:39,880
Jack, this is impossible. I can't see you.

934
01:17:40,092 --> 01:17:42,367
- I need to talk to you.
- No, Jack. No.

935
01:17:44,513 --> 01:17:46,424
Jack, I'm engaged.

936
01:17:47,850 --> 01:17:49,408
I'm marrying Cal.

937
01:17:50,436 --> 01:17:51,755
I love Cal.

938
01:17:55,649 --> 01:17:58,004
Rose, you're no picnic, all right?

939
01:17:58,193 --> 01:18:00,582
You're a spoiled little brat, even.

940
01:18:00,779 --> 01:18:03,612
But under that,
you're the most amazingly...

941
01:18:04,324 --> 01:18:06,633
astounding, wonderful girl...

942
01:18:07,369 --> 01:18:10,008
Woman that I've ever known and-

943
01:18:10,205 --> 01:18:12,400
- Jack, I-
- No, let me try to get this out.

944
01:18:12,583 --> 01:18:13,902
You're...

945
01:18:16,295 --> 01:18:19,173
I'm not an idiot.
I know how the world works.

946
01:18:19,381 --> 01:18:21,178
I've got $10 in my pocket.

947
01:18:21,341 --> 01:18:24,174
I have nothing to offer you
and I know that.

948
01:18:24,595 --> 01:18:25,994
I understand.

949
01:18:27,181 --> 01:18:29,057
But I'm too involved now.

950
01:18:29,223 --> 01:18:31,134
You jump, I jump, remember?

951
01:18:31,309 --> 01:18:34,585
I can't turn away without knowing
you'll be all right.

952
01:18:35,313 --> 01:18:37,144
That's all that I want.

953
01:18:38,233 --> 01:18:39,746
Well, I'm fine.

954
01:18:40,819 --> 01:18:42,730
I'll be fine. Really.

955
01:18:44,197 --> 01:18:45,346
Really?

956
01:18:47,325 --> 01:18:48,917
I don't think so.

957
01:18:50,245 --> 01:18:51,758
They have got you trapped, Rose.

958
01:18:51,913 --> 01:18:53,904
And you're gonna die
if you don't break free.

959
01:18:54,082 --> 01:18:56,879
Maybe not right away,
because you're strong...

960
01:18:58,002 --> 01:19:01,551
but sooner or later,
that fire that I love about you, Rose...

961
01:19:01,798 --> 01:19:03,913
that fire's going to burn out.

962
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:11,569
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.

963
01:19:13,059 --> 01:19:14,492
You're right.

964
01:19:15,686 --> 01:19:17,438
Only you can do that.

965
01:19:23,694 --> 01:19:26,208
I'm going back. Leave me alone.

966
01:19:38,709 --> 01:19:41,826
Tell Lucile about the disaster you had
with the stationers.

967
01:19:42,045 --> 01:19:44,684
Of course, the invitations had to be
sent back, twice.

968
01:19:44,882 --> 01:19:47,760
- Oh, my dear.
- And the dreadful bridesmaids' gowns.

969
01:19:47,968 --> 01:19:50,402
Let me tell you,
what an odyssey that has been.

970
01:19:50,596 --> 01:19:54,305
Rose decided she wanted lavender.
She knows I detest the color.

971
01:19:54,558 --> 01:19:56,594
She did it to spite me.

972
01:19:56,769 --> 01:19:58,885
If only you'd come to me sooner.

973
01:19:59,063 --> 01:20:01,293
Ruth saw some of my designs
in La Mode lllustrée...

974
01:20:01,482 --> 01:20:02,631
they were for the trousseau...

975
01:20:02,775 --> 01:20:05,767
of the Duchess of Marlborough's youngest
daughter. They were quite charming.

976
01:20:05,986 --> 01:20:08,215
I think you'll agree, my dear,
that together...

977
01:20:08,988 --> 01:20:11,707
we've created something of a phoenix
from the ashes.

978
01:20:26,673 --> 01:20:28,026
Hello, Jack.

979
01:20:33,597 --> 01:20:35,189
I changed my mind.

980
01:20:41,438 --> 01:20:43,554
They said you might be up here-

981
01:20:45,399 --> 01:20:47,037
Give me your hand.

982
01:20:54,325 --> 01:20:56,043
Now close your eyes.

983
01:20:57,161 --> 01:20:58,310
Go on.

984
01:21:01,624 --> 01:21:02,977
Now step up.

985
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:09,849
Now hold on to the railing.
Keep your eyes closed.

986
01:21:10,050 --> 01:21:11,768
- Don't peek.
- I'm not.

987
01:21:13,136 --> 01:21:14,967
Step up onto the rail.

988
01:21:19,183 --> 01:21:21,253
Hold on. Hold on.

989
01:21:21,519 --> 01:21:23,350
Keep your eyes closed.

990
01:21:23,771 --> 01:21:26,604
- Do you trust me?
- I trust you.

991
01:21:36,951 --> 01:21:39,624
All right, open your eyes.

992
01:21:46,794 --> 01:21:48,863
I'm flying. Jack.

993
01:22:14,154 --> 01:22:17,749
Come, Josephine, in my flying machine

994
01:22:17,991 --> 01:22:22,746
Going up she goes
Up she goes

995
01:23:10,793 --> 01:23:13,865
That was the last time Titanic
ever saw daylight.

996
01:23:14,881 --> 01:23:17,600
We're up to dusk, the night of the sinking.

997
01:23:17,967 --> 01:23:20,083
- Six hours to go.
- Incredible.

998
01:23:20,386 --> 01:23:22,058
There's Smith, and he's standing there...

999
01:23:22,222 --> 01:23:24,611
and he's got the iceberg warning
in his fucking hand.

1000
01:23:24,808 --> 01:23:27,560
Excuse me, his hand,
and he's ordering more speed.

1001
01:23:27,768 --> 01:23:30,487
Twenty-six years of experience working
against him.

1002
01:23:31,188 --> 01:23:35,306
He figures anything big enough to sink
the ship, they're gonna see in time to turn.

1003
01:23:35,567 --> 01:23:38,206
But the ship's too big
with too small a rudder.

1004
01:23:38,404 --> 01:23:40,474
Doesn't corner worth a damn.

1005
01:23:41,073 --> 01:23:43,143
Everything he knows is wrong.

1006
01:23:55,963 --> 01:23:59,433
It's quite proper, I assure you.
This is the sitting room.

1007
01:24:01,718 --> 01:24:03,868
- Will this light do?
- What?

1008
01:24:04,304 --> 01:24:06,454
Don't artists need good light?

1009
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:10,315
That is true, but I'm not used to working
in such horrible conditions.

1010
01:24:11,645 --> 01:24:12,794
Monet!

1011
01:24:14,064 --> 01:24:16,180
- You know his work?
- Of course.

1012
01:24:16,733 --> 01:24:19,122
Look at his use of color here.
Isn't he great?

1013
01:24:19,319 --> 01:24:21,310
I know. It's extraordinary.

1014
01:24:23,615 --> 01:24:26,891
Cal insists on carting
this hideous thing everywhere.

1015
01:24:27,453 --> 01:24:30,092
Should we be expecting him
anytime soon?

1016
01:24:30,914 --> 01:24:33,791
Not as long as the cigars
and brandy hold out.

1017
01:24:37,587 --> 01:24:40,306
That's nice. What is it, a sapphire?

1018
01:24:41,382 --> 01:24:44,340
A diamond. A very rare diamond.

1019
01:24:48,389 --> 01:24:51,904
Jack, I want you to draw me
like one of your French girls.

1020
01:24:52,435 --> 01:24:54,995
- Wearing this.
- All right.

1021
01:24:56,982 --> 01:24:58,574
Wearing only this.

1022
01:25:33,976 --> 01:25:35,648
The last thing I need...

1023
01:25:35,811 --> 01:25:39,122
is another picture of me
looking like a porcelain doll.

1024
01:25:42,151 --> 01:25:44,061
As a paying customer...

1025
01:25:45,904 --> 01:25:47,974
I expect to get what I want.

1026
01:26:05,966 --> 01:26:08,480
Over on the bed. The couch.

1027
01:26:17,394 --> 01:26:19,112
Lie down.

1028
01:26:23,191 --> 01:26:26,820
- Tell me when it looks right.
- Put your arm back the way it was.

1029
01:26:28,697 --> 01:26:32,053
Put that other arm up,
that hand right by your face there.

1030
01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:34,809
Right.

1031
01:26:35,495 --> 01:26:37,247
Now, head down.

1032
01:26:39,708 --> 01:26:41,824
Eyes to me, keep them on me.

1033
01:26:44,003 --> 01:26:45,756
And try to stay still.

1034
01:27:04,816 --> 01:27:06,135
So serious.

1035
01:27:48,192 --> 01:27:51,025
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste.

1036
01:27:55,616 --> 01:27:58,288
I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.

1037
01:27:59,661 --> 01:28:01,333
He does landscapes.

1038
01:28:02,289 --> 01:28:04,564
- Just relax your face.
- Sorry.

1039
01:28:04,750 --> 01:28:06,069
No laughing.

1040
01:28:37,115 --> 01:28:39,629
My heart was pounding the whole time.

1041
01:28:40,452 --> 01:28:43,842
It was the most erotic moment of my life...

1042
01:28:47,834 --> 01:28:49,790
up until then, at least.

1043
01:28:51,046 --> 01:28:52,843
So what happened next?

1044
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:56,058
You mean, did we do it?

1045
01:29:00,012 --> 01:29:01,684
Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine.

1046
01:29:01,848 --> 01:29:03,884
Jack was very professional.

1047
01:29:11,649 --> 01:29:12,968
Thank you.

1048
01:29:21,367 --> 01:29:23,039
What are you doing?

1049
01:29:23,536 --> 01:29:26,289
Will you put this back in the safe for me?

1050
01:29:38,092 --> 01:29:40,128
- Gentlemen, would you excuse me?
- Sure.

1051
01:29:42,304 --> 01:29:44,693
None of the stewards have seen her.

1052
01:29:45,307 --> 01:29:47,662
This is absurd. It's a ship.

1053
01:29:47,851 --> 01:29:50,126
There's only so many places she could be.

1054
01:29:50,312 --> 01:29:51,904
Lovejoy, find her.

1055
01:30:09,665 --> 01:30:11,097
- Clear.
- Yes.

1056
01:30:12,417 --> 01:30:15,329
I don't think I've ever seen
such a flat calm.

1057
01:30:16,713 --> 01:30:19,864
Like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.

1058
01:30:21,343 --> 01:30:23,982
It will make the 'bergs harder to see...

1059
01:30:24,388 --> 01:30:26,822
with no breaking water at the base.

1060
01:30:38,277 --> 01:30:39,710
Well, I'm off.

1061
01:30:39,862 --> 01:30:42,581
Maintain speed and heading,
Mr. Lightoller.

1062
01:30:43,031 --> 01:30:44,226
Yes, sir.

1063
01:30:55,543 --> 01:30:57,135
It's getting cold.

1064
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:59,331
- You look nice.
- Miss Rose?

1065
01:31:00,507 --> 01:31:01,826
My drawings.

1066
01:31:27,992 --> 01:31:29,186
Come on, Jack!

1067
01:31:32,788 --> 01:31:34,665
- Wait!
- Wait!

1068
01:31:35,875 --> 01:31:37,991
- Go!
- Take us down, quick.

1069
01:31:38,169 --> 01:31:39,602
- Go!
- Quickly! Quickly!

1070
01:31:45,051 --> 01:31:46,085
Bye.

1071
01:31:53,934 --> 01:31:54,923
Sorry.

1072
01:32:00,524 --> 01:32:02,515
- Keep going.
- Thank you, I've got it.

1073
01:32:12,828 --> 01:32:15,342
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.

1074
01:32:15,539 --> 01:32:18,099
- Seems more like a cop.
- I think he was.

1075
01:32:18,875 --> 01:32:20,354
- Oh, shit.
- Go!

1076
01:32:25,132 --> 01:32:27,565
- No, over here!
- Quick!

1077
01:32:34,766 --> 01:32:37,041
- Now what?
- What?

1078
01:32:43,525 --> 01:32:45,993
More coal for number one, mate.

1079
01:32:46,194 --> 01:32:48,344
What are you two doing down here?

1080
01:32:48,530 --> 01:32:50,805
You shouldn't be down here.
It could be dangerous!

1081
01:32:54,744 --> 01:32:56,939
Carry on. Don't mind us.

1082
01:32:57,122 --> 01:33:00,079
You're doing a great job.
Keep up the good work!

1083
01:33:16,057 --> 01:33:18,048
Look at what we have here.

1084
01:33:36,452 --> 01:33:37,680
Thank you.

1085
01:33:49,382 --> 01:33:50,861
Where to, miss?

1086
01:33:52,343 --> 01:33:53,776
To the stars.

1087
01:34:12,863 --> 01:34:14,216
You nervous?

1088
01:34:16,742 --> 01:34:17,777
No.

1089
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:36,796
Put your hands on me, Jack.

1090
01:35:01,578 --> 01:35:03,091
It's bloody cold.

1091
01:35:03,246 --> 01:35:05,918
You know, I can smell ice, you know.
When it's near.

1092
01:35:08,084 --> 01:35:10,598
- Bollocks!
- Well, I can, all right?

1093
01:35:11,671 --> 01:35:13,901
Did you ever find those binoculars
for the lookouts?

1094
01:35:14,090 --> 01:35:16,524
Haven't seen them since Southampton.

1095
01:35:16,717 --> 01:35:19,106
Well, I'll be on my rounds. Cheerio.

1096
01:35:50,918 --> 01:35:52,510
You're trembling.

1097
01:35:54,505 --> 01:35:57,144
Don't worry, I'll be all right.

1098
01:36:19,279 --> 01:36:21,554
- They ran down there.
- All right.

1099
01:36:30,832 --> 01:36:32,390
Anything missing?

1100
01:36:57,317 --> 01:36:59,228
I've got a better idea.

1101
01:37:12,123 --> 01:37:13,112
Gotcha!

1102
01:37:22,467 --> 01:37:24,582
Did you see those guys' faces?

1103
01:37:25,886 --> 01:37:27,444
Did you see them?

1104
01:37:34,103 --> 01:37:35,934
When the ship docks...

1105
01:37:37,356 --> 01:37:39,312
I'm getting off with you.

1106
01:37:40,234 --> 01:37:42,111
- This is crazy.
- I know.

1107
01:37:42,278 --> 01:37:44,189
It doesn't make any sense.

1108
01:37:45,823 --> 01:37:47,619
That's why I trust it.

1109
01:37:57,542 --> 01:37:59,214
Here, look at this.

1110
01:38:00,087 --> 01:38:01,918
Look at that, would you?

1111
01:38:02,089 --> 01:38:04,080
They're a bit warmer than we are.

1112
01:38:04,258 --> 01:38:06,692
If that's what it takes for us
to get warm, I'd rather not...

1113
01:38:06,885 --> 01:38:08,682
if it's all the same to you, all right?

1114
01:38:20,941 --> 01:38:22,772
Bugger me!

1115
01:38:27,697 --> 01:38:29,494
Pick up, you bastards!

1116
01:38:32,869 --> 01:38:35,099
- Is anyone there?
- Yes, what do you see?

1117
01:38:35,288 --> 01:38:37,597
- Iceberg, right ahead!
- Thank you.

1118
01:38:40,335 --> 01:38:41,654
Iceberg, right ahead!

1119
01:38:41,795 --> 01:38:43,467
Hard to starboard!

1120
01:38:50,679 --> 01:38:53,068
Turn! Smartly!

1121
01:38:57,978 --> 01:38:59,331
Full astern!

1122
01:39:01,564 --> 01:39:03,919
- Hard over.
- Helm's hard over, sir.

1123
01:39:07,820 --> 01:39:09,253
Go, lads, go!

1124
01:39:12,075 --> 01:39:14,589
Bring that steam down! Bring it down!

1125
01:39:16,663 --> 01:39:19,052
Shut all the dampers! Shut them!

1126
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:25,148
Hold it.

1127
01:39:29,384 --> 01:39:31,658
Now! Engage the reversing engine.

1128
01:40:00,248 --> 01:40:02,044
Why ain't they turning?

1129
01:40:02,208 --> 01:40:05,085
- Is it hard over?
- It is. Yes, sir, hard over.

1130
01:40:10,465 --> 01:40:13,582
Come on. Come on. Turn.

1131
01:40:24,646 --> 01:40:25,635
Yes.

1132
01:40:31,278 --> 01:40:32,757
It's gonna hit!

1133
01:40:44,290 --> 01:40:45,689
Jesus Christ!

1134
01:41:06,521 --> 01:41:07,874
Jesus.

1135
01:41:08,023 --> 01:41:10,457
- Hard to port!
- Hard to port!

1136
01:41:20,618 --> 01:41:21,812
Get back!

1137
01:41:51,065 --> 01:41:52,498
Come on, let's go!

1138
01:41:52,649 --> 01:41:55,083
Get out of the door.
They're closing the doors!

1139
01:41:55,277 --> 01:41:56,471
Get out!

1140
01:42:02,660 --> 01:42:04,855
Get out of the door! Go!

1141
01:42:05,871 --> 01:42:08,590
Come on, lads! Go, lads, go!

1142
01:42:21,137 --> 01:42:22,171
Out!

1143
01:42:36,902 --> 01:42:38,176
Oh, my God.

1144
01:42:39,613 --> 01:42:41,205
That was a close shave, wasn't it?

1145
01:42:41,365 --> 01:42:43,799
Smell ice, can you? Bleeding Christ!

1146
01:42:48,413 --> 01:42:50,927
Note the time and enter it in the log.

1147
01:42:56,796 --> 01:42:58,832
What was that, Mr. Murdoch?

1148
01:42:59,424 --> 01:43:00,982
An iceberg, sir.

1149
01:43:01,926 --> 01:43:05,680
I put her hard to starboard, and ran the
engines full astern, but it was too close.

1150
01:43:05,930 --> 01:43:08,125
I tried to port round it, but she hit.

1151
01:43:08,308 --> 01:43:11,459
- Close the watertight doors.
- Doors are closed, sir.

1152
01:43:14,397 --> 01:43:16,115
- All stop.
- Aye, sir.

1153
01:43:24,658 --> 01:43:26,649
Find the carpenter.
Get him to sound the ship.

1154
01:43:26,825 --> 01:43:28,019
Yes, sir.

1155
01:43:38,921 --> 01:43:40,957
Come on, let's get the hell out of here.

1156
01:43:41,132 --> 01:43:42,167
Come on, hurry up.

1157
01:43:47,263 --> 01:43:49,060
Excuse me,
why have the engines stopped?

1158
01:43:49,223 --> 01:43:51,214
- I felt a shudder.
- I shouldn't worry, madam.

1159
01:43:51,392 --> 01:43:54,304
We've likely thrown a propeller blade.
That's the shudder you felt.

1160
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:56,317
May I bring you anything?

1161
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:57,549
No, thank you.

1162
01:44:02,903 --> 01:44:05,178
So, now there's talk of an iceberg.
Did you see anything?

1163
01:44:05,364 --> 01:44:07,161
I don't see anything now. Do you?

1164
01:44:09,117 --> 01:44:12,268
If this is the direction the rats are going,
that's good enough for me.

1165
01:44:15,416 --> 01:44:17,407
Everything's under control.

1166
01:44:19,378 --> 01:44:21,414
- You there.
- Sir, there is no emergency.

1167
01:44:21,589 --> 01:44:23,227
Yes, there is. I've been robbed.

1168
01:44:23,382 --> 01:44:24,861
Get the master-at-arms.

1169
01:44:25,009 --> 01:44:26,886
- Now, you moron!
- Yes, sir.

1170
01:44:30,222 --> 01:44:32,098
Hey, did I miss the fun?

1171
01:44:33,725 --> 01:44:35,681
- Did you see what happened?
- No, I missed it.

1172
01:44:35,853 --> 01:44:37,969
Apparently, it hit over there.

1173
01:44:38,271 --> 01:44:40,831
Boiler Room 6 is flooded
8 feet above the plate...

1174
01:44:41,024 --> 01:44:43,060
and the mail hold is worse.
She's all buckled in-

1175
01:44:43,235 --> 01:44:45,305
- Can you shore up?
- Not unless the pumps get ahead.

1176
01:44:45,487 --> 01:44:47,159
Have you seen the damage
in the mail hold?

1177
01:44:47,322 --> 01:44:49,438
No, she's already underwater.

1178
01:44:49,616 --> 01:44:50,969
This is bad.

1179
01:44:53,328 --> 01:44:55,000
We should tell Mother and Cal.

1180
01:44:56,206 --> 01:44:58,401
I think they're very good, sir.

1181
01:45:01,169 --> 01:45:04,639
Don't touch anything.
I want the entire room photographed.

1182
01:45:09,343 --> 01:45:11,618
We've been looking for you, miss.

1183
01:45:16,017 --> 01:45:17,086
Here we go.

1184
01:45:23,316 --> 01:45:25,511
Something serious has happened.

1185
01:45:26,194 --> 01:45:27,593
Yes, it has.

1186
01:45:29,030 --> 01:45:30,065
Indeed.

1187
01:45:30,198 --> 01:45:32,507
Two things dear to me
have disappeared this evening.

1188
01:45:32,700 --> 01:45:35,816
Now that one is back, I have
a pretty good idea where to find the other.

1189
01:45:36,037 --> 01:45:37,071
Search him.

1190
01:45:37,205 --> 01:45:38,796
- Take your coat off, son.
- Now what?

1191
01:45:38,957 --> 01:45:40,184
Come on, now.

1192
01:45:40,332 --> 01:45:42,130
Cal, what are you doing?

1193
01:45:42,293 --> 01:45:44,523
We're in the middle of an emergency.
What's going on?

1194
01:45:44,712 --> 01:45:46,782
- Is this it?
- That's it.

1195
01:45:47,506 --> 01:45:49,098
This is horseshit!

1196
01:45:50,050 --> 01:45:51,802
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't.

1197
01:45:51,969 --> 01:45:53,880
- He couldn't have.
- Of course he could.

1198
01:45:54,054 --> 01:45:55,646
It's easy enough for a professional.

1199
01:45:55,806 --> 01:45:58,445
But I was with him the whole time.
This is absurd.

1200
01:45:58,642 --> 01:46:02,601
Perhaps he did it while you were putting
your clothes back on, dear.

1201
01:46:03,189 --> 01:46:05,339
Real slick, Cal.
Rose, they put it in my pocket.

1202
01:46:05,524 --> 01:46:08,436
- Shut up.
- It isn't even your pocket. Is it, son?

1203
01:46:08,652 --> 01:46:10,644
"Property of A.L. Ryerson. "

1204
01:46:14,491 --> 01:46:15,891
That was reported stolen today.

1205
01:46:16,034 --> 01:46:17,865
I just borrowed it. I was gonna return it.

1206
01:46:18,036 --> 01:46:20,425
An honest thief.
We have an honest thief here, do we?

1207
01:46:20,622 --> 01:46:23,420
You know I didn't do this, Rose.
You know it.

1208
01:46:23,709 --> 01:46:25,347
Don't believe them, Rose. You know it.

1209
01:46:25,502 --> 01:46:28,335
- You know I didn't do it.
- Come on, son. Let's go.

1210
01:46:28,547 --> 01:46:30,936
- Rose!
- Come on, there's a good lad.

1211
01:46:31,550 --> 01:46:32,665
Come on.

1212
01:46:32,801 --> 01:46:34,996
You know I didn't do it. You know me!

1213
01:46:36,805 --> 01:46:38,761
This is most unfortunate, Captain.

1214
01:46:42,894 --> 01:46:45,966
Water 14 feet above the keel
in 10 minutes...

1215
01:46:46,814 --> 01:46:49,966
in the forepeak, in all three holds,
and in Boiler Room 6.

1216
01:46:50,193 --> 01:46:53,026
- That's right, sir.
- When can we get underway, damn it?

1217
01:46:53,238 --> 01:46:55,194
That's five compartments.

1218
01:46:56,991 --> 01:46:59,505
She can stay afloat with the first four
compartments breached...

1219
01:46:59,703 --> 01:47:01,102
but not five.

1220
01:47:01,621 --> 01:47:02,815
Not five.

1221
01:47:03,081 --> 01:47:04,594
As she goes down by the head...

1222
01:47:04,749 --> 01:47:07,900
the water will spill over
the tops of the bulkheads at E deck...

1223
01:47:08,378 --> 01:47:10,687
from one to the next, back and back.

1224
01:47:10,964 --> 01:47:12,761
There's no stopping it.

1225
01:47:12,924 --> 01:47:14,243
The pumps. We open the pumps...

1226
01:47:14,384 --> 01:47:17,057
The pumps buy you time,
but minutes only.

1227
01:47:18,262 --> 01:47:20,538
From this moment,
no matter what we do...

1228
01:47:21,432 --> 01:47:23,150
Titanic will founder.

1229
01:47:25,937 --> 01:47:27,336
But this ship can't sink.

1230
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:31,268
She's made of iron, sir.
I assure you, she can. And she will.

1231
01:47:32,568 --> 01:47:34,445
It is a mathematical certainty.

1232
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:40,633
How much time?

1233
01:47:48,166 --> 01:47:50,362
An hour. Two, at most.

1234
01:47:56,759 --> 01:47:59,068
And how many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?

1235
01:47:59,344 --> 01:48:01,574
2,200 souls on board, sir.

1236
01:48:08,979 --> 01:48:11,937
Well, I believe you may get your headlines,
Mr. Ismay.

1237
01:48:29,686 --> 01:48:31,916
Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?

1238
01:48:32,772 --> 01:48:34,763
You look at me when I'm talking to you!

1239
01:48:35,025 --> 01:48:37,142
- Mr. Hockley?
- Not now. We're busy.

1240
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:40,039
Sir, I've been told to ask you
to put on your lifebelts...

1241
01:48:40,239 --> 01:48:42,230
- and come up to the boat deck.
- I said, not now.

1242
01:48:42,408 --> 01:48:45,400
I'm sorry to inconvenience you,
Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders.

1243
01:48:45,620 --> 01:48:47,498
Now please, dress warmly.

1244
01:48:47,873 --> 01:48:49,943
It's quite cold out tonight.

1245
01:48:50,417 --> 01:48:52,931
Now, may I suggest topcoats and hats?

1246
01:48:53,545 --> 01:48:55,217
This is ridiculous.

1247
01:48:56,006 --> 01:48:59,283
Not to worry, miss.
I'm sure it's just a precaution.

1248
01:48:59,886 --> 01:49:01,717
Everybody up. Lifebelts on.

1249
01:49:03,890 --> 01:49:05,608
What's he on about?

1250
01:49:05,767 --> 01:49:08,042
- Everybody up. Put your lifebelts on.
- What's the ruckus?

1251
01:49:08,228 --> 01:49:09,503
Just put your lifebelts on.

1252
01:49:11,065 --> 01:49:12,054
CQD?

1253
01:49:12,817 --> 01:49:13,886
Sir?

1254
01:49:15,528 --> 01:49:17,644
That's right, CQD, the distress call.

1255
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:19,558
That's our position.

1256
01:49:25,039 --> 01:49:27,507
Tell whoever responds
that we're going down by the head...

1257
01:49:27,708 --> 01:49:29,585
and need immediate assistance.

1258
01:49:38,554 --> 01:49:39,748
Blimey.

1259
01:49:50,233 --> 01:49:51,552
Keep lowering!

1260
01:49:57,867 --> 01:50:01,462
Steady! Make it taut! And winch out!

1261
01:50:06,794 --> 01:50:09,945
Uncover this boat!
Uncover all the boats aft!

1262
01:50:10,172 --> 01:50:11,844
Release those ties!

1263
01:50:12,133 --> 01:50:14,886
Roll back that cover! Smartly now!

1264
01:50:15,553 --> 01:50:17,192
Mr. Wilde, where are the passengers?

1265
01:50:17,347 --> 01:50:20,623
They've all gone back inside.
Too damn cold and noisy for them.

1266
01:50:20,851 --> 01:50:21,886
You there!

1267
01:50:22,936 --> 01:50:24,847
Get down here and help with these lines!

1268
01:50:39,455 --> 01:50:41,286
Care for a drink, sir?

1269
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:43,774
Please put your lifebelts on.

1270
01:50:43,918 --> 01:50:45,590
Sonny, what's doing?

1271
01:50:45,795 --> 01:50:48,593
You got us all trussed up here
and now we're cooling our heels.

1272
01:50:48,798 --> 01:50:50,710
Sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out.

1273
01:50:51,677 --> 01:50:54,430
I don't think anybody knows
what the hell's going on around here.

1274
01:50:54,638 --> 01:50:57,391
It's just the goddamned English,
doing everything by the book.

1275
01:50:57,600 --> 01:51:00,319
There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.

1276
01:51:00,686 --> 01:51:02,962
Go back and turn the heaters on
in our rooms.

1277
01:51:03,148 --> 01:51:04,945
I'd like a cup of tea when I return.

1278
01:51:05,109 --> 01:51:06,906
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

1279
01:51:16,580 --> 01:51:18,059
Mr. Andrews...

1280
01:51:19,624 --> 01:51:22,536
I saw the iceberg.
And I see it in your eyes.

1281
01:51:23,044 --> 01:51:24,444
Please tell me the truth.

1282
01:51:33,097 --> 01:51:34,770
The ship will sink.

1283
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:38,152
- You're certain?
- Yes.

1284
01:51:38,521 --> 01:51:40,193
In an hour or so...

1285
01:51:41,065 --> 01:51:44,137
all this will be
at the bottom of the Atlantic.

1286
01:51:44,986 --> 01:51:46,022
What?

1287
01:51:46,154 --> 01:51:48,110
Please, tell only who you must.

1288
01:51:48,282 --> 01:51:50,432
I don't want to be responsible for a panic.

1289
01:51:50,701 --> 01:51:53,261
And get to a boat. Quickly. Don't wait.

1290
01:51:54,455 --> 01:51:57,289
You remember
what I told you about the boats?

1291
01:51:59,836 --> 01:52:00,871
Yes.

1292
01:52:02,881 --> 01:52:04,314
I understand.

1293
01:52:08,721 --> 01:52:11,030
Yes, madam, please put it on immediately.

1294
01:52:12,392 --> 01:52:13,871
Over here, son.

1295
01:52:14,811 --> 01:52:17,200
Sir, they need you up
at the second-class purser's office.

1296
01:52:17,397 --> 01:52:20,276
- There's a big mob up there.
- Go on. I'll keep an eye on him.

1297
01:52:20,943 --> 01:52:22,296
Aye. Right.

1298
01:52:36,293 --> 01:52:37,362
Sir!

1299
01:52:37,503 --> 01:52:39,858
Carpathia says they're making 17 knots.

1300
01:52:40,047 --> 01:52:41,924
Full steam for them, sir.

1301
01:52:43,343 --> 01:52:44,901
She's the only one who's responding?

1302
01:52:45,053 --> 01:52:46,452
The only one close, sir.

1303
01:52:46,596 --> 01:52:48,712
Says they can be here in four hours.

1304
01:52:49,349 --> 01:52:50,668
Four hours!

1305
01:52:56,065 --> 01:52:57,623
Thank you, Bride.

1306
01:53:02,196 --> 01:53:03,345
My God.

1307
01:53:13,042 --> 01:53:15,272
We are swung out and ready, sir.

1308
01:53:16,546 --> 01:53:19,743
Hadn't we better get the women
and children into the boats, sir?

1309
01:53:22,469 --> 01:53:23,584
Yes.

1310
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:24,755
Sir?

1311
01:53:27,475 --> 01:53:30,672
Women and children first, yes.

1312
01:53:32,230 --> 01:53:33,458
Yes, sir.

1313
01:53:36,443 --> 01:53:39,481
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please!

1314
01:53:39,947 --> 01:53:42,177
Step this way, please. That's right.

1315
01:53:42,450 --> 01:53:44,759
Come towards me. Thank you.

1316
01:53:46,371 --> 01:53:47,440
Good.

1317
01:53:47,664 --> 01:53:51,544
For the time being,
I shall require only women and children.

1318
01:53:52,002 --> 01:53:54,038
- Gentlemen, please.
- Right here.

1319
01:53:54,213 --> 01:53:57,842
All right, boys. Like the Captain said,
nice and cheery, so there's no panic.

1320
01:53:59,093 --> 01:54:00,652
Wedding Dance.

1321
01:54:08,854 --> 01:54:11,129
Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on.

1322
01:54:12,817 --> 01:54:14,455
Here, put your lifebelt on.

1323
01:54:14,611 --> 01:54:16,647
Yeah, come on. Put your lifebelt on.

1324
01:54:16,821 --> 01:54:18,379
Turn that around.

1325
01:54:19,532 --> 01:54:20,726
Please.

1326
01:54:22,827 --> 01:54:25,217
It isn't time to go up to the boats yet!

1327
01:54:25,706 --> 01:54:27,185
Please stay calm.

1328
01:54:27,333 --> 01:54:31,008
Make sure, everybody,
you've got your lifebelts on.

1329
01:54:31,254 --> 01:54:33,927
And, gentlemen, allow the women
and children through to the front.

1330
01:54:34,132 --> 01:54:36,442
- What are we doing, Mommy?
- We're just waiting, dear.

1331
01:54:36,635 --> 01:54:39,024
When they finish putting
first-class people in the boats...

1332
01:54:39,221 --> 01:54:42,258
they will be starting with us
and we'll want to be all ready, won't we?

1333
01:54:42,474 --> 01:54:43,907
Everybody, not just right yet.

1334
01:54:44,059 --> 01:54:45,891
Don't push on the gates.
You won't get out any faster.

1335
01:54:46,063 --> 01:54:47,416
- Someone help.
- Go and get some help.

1336
01:54:47,564 --> 01:54:50,032
Lower it away, left and right together!

1337
01:54:52,402 --> 01:54:54,677
Both sides together! Steady!

1338
01:54:55,614 --> 01:54:56,809
Steady!

1339
01:55:00,036 --> 01:55:01,515
Stop!

1340
01:55:02,622 --> 01:55:04,294
Hold the left side!

1341
01:55:04,457 --> 01:55:06,652
Right side only!

1342
01:55:07,085 --> 01:55:09,395
Right side only. Hold the left side!

1343
01:55:10,923 --> 01:55:12,641
Lower away together!

1344
01:55:14,510 --> 01:55:15,943
Steady, lads!

1345
01:56:03,689 --> 01:56:06,648
You know, I do believe this ship may sink.

1346
01:56:09,363 --> 01:56:13,151
I've been asked to give you
this small token of our appreciation.

1347
01:56:16,329 --> 01:56:18,718
Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.

1348
01:56:25,797 --> 01:56:28,551
Come on, sister. You heard the man.
Into the boat.

1349
01:56:29,052 --> 01:56:30,849
Any room for a gentleman, gentlemen?

1350
01:56:31,012 --> 01:56:33,082
Only women at this time, sir.

1351
01:56:35,642 --> 01:56:38,441
Will the lifeboats be seated
according to class?

1352
01:56:40,022 --> 01:56:42,252
I hope they're not too crowded.

1353
01:56:43,484 --> 01:56:45,714
Oh, Mother, shut up!

1354
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:47,799
Don't you understand?

1355
01:56:47,947 --> 01:56:50,223
The water is freezing
and there aren't enough boats.

1356
01:56:50,409 --> 01:56:52,047
Not enough by half.

1357
01:56:52,494 --> 01:56:54,724
Half the people on this ship
are going to die.

1358
01:56:55,122 --> 01:56:56,840
Not the better half.

1359
01:56:58,667 --> 01:57:02,502
Come on, Ruth, get in the boat.
First-class seats are right up here.

1360
01:57:03,381 --> 01:57:05,417
You know, it's a pity
I didn't keep that drawing.

1361
01:57:05,592 --> 01:57:07,469
It'll be worth a lot more by morning.

1362
01:57:07,636 --> 01:57:10,594
Women and children
towards the front, please.

1363
01:57:10,806 --> 01:57:13,196
You unimaginable bastard.

1364
01:57:14,269 --> 01:57:16,908
Come on, Rose, darling.
There's plenty of room for you.

1365
01:57:17,105 --> 01:57:18,220
Right this way, miss.

1366
01:57:18,356 --> 01:57:19,755
Come on, Rose.

1367
01:57:19,899 --> 01:57:21,617
You're next, darling.

1368
01:57:21,860 --> 01:57:23,772
Come into the boat, Rose.

1369
01:57:25,031 --> 01:57:26,100
Come.

1370
01:57:26,615 --> 01:57:27,684
Rose?

1371
01:57:28,826 --> 01:57:30,464
Get into the boat.

1372
01:57:30,870 --> 01:57:31,939
Rose?

1373
01:57:33,497 --> 01:57:35,056
Goodbye, Mother.

1374
01:57:36,794 --> 01:57:37,863
Rose?

1375
01:57:38,378 --> 01:57:40,767
- Rose, come back here.
- Where are you going?

1376
01:57:41,382 --> 01:57:42,531
To him?

1377
01:57:42,716 --> 01:57:44,627
What, to be a whore to a gutter rat?

1378
01:57:44,802 --> 01:57:45,792
No, wait.

1379
01:57:45,929 --> 01:57:48,568
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.

1380
01:57:51,810 --> 01:57:52,799
No!

1381
01:57:53,437 --> 01:57:54,790
I said, no!

1382
01:57:56,607 --> 01:57:58,518
Rose, please stop!

1383
01:58:00,361 --> 01:58:01,919
- Lower away!
- No, stop!

1384
01:58:02,071 --> 01:58:03,709
- All together.
- No, wait!

1385
01:58:03,865 --> 01:58:05,184
Lower away!

1386
01:58:05,408 --> 01:58:06,523
Rose!

1387
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,069
Help!

1388
01:58:14,877 --> 01:58:16,868
Can anybody hear me?

1389
01:58:18,130 --> 01:58:20,008
Hello! Help me!

1390
01:58:30,312 --> 01:58:31,631
Mr. Andrews!

1391
01:58:35,108 --> 01:58:37,668
- Steward, check the starboard corridor.
- Yes, Mr. Andrews.

1392
01:58:37,861 --> 01:58:40,659
Madam, please, put on a lifebelt.
Get to the boat deck immediately.

1393
01:58:40,864 --> 01:58:43,425
Lucy, for God's sake,
put on a lifebelt and set a good example.

1394
01:58:43,618 --> 01:58:44,846
Yes, sir.

1395
01:58:45,370 --> 01:58:47,565
- Anyone in here?
- Mr. Andrews?

1396
01:58:47,956 --> 01:58:48,991
Thank God.

1397
01:58:49,123 --> 01:58:51,683
Where would the master-at-arms
take someone under arrest?

1398
01:58:52,126 --> 01:58:54,561
- You have to get to a boat right away.
- No!

1399
01:58:54,755 --> 01:58:56,985
I'm doing this
with or without your help, sir.

1400
01:58:57,174 --> 01:58:59,130
But without will take longer.

1401
01:59:00,553 --> 01:59:03,351
Take the elevator to the very bottom.
Go to the left.

1402
01:59:03,557 --> 01:59:07,106
Down the crewmen's passage,
then go right and left again at the stairs.

1403
01:59:07,352 --> 01:59:08,785
You'll come to a long corridor.

1404
01:59:13,108 --> 01:59:14,747
This could be bad.

1405
01:59:19,115 --> 01:59:20,309
Oh, shit!

1406
01:59:27,250 --> 01:59:29,002
Excuse me. Thank you.

1407
01:59:30,503 --> 01:59:32,733
- I do not care what you think, sir.
- Lifts are closed.

1408
01:59:32,922 --> 01:59:35,675
I'm sorry, miss, but the lifts are closed.

1409
01:59:36,801 --> 01:59:40,272
I'm through being polite, God damn it!
Now, take me down!

1410
01:59:42,183 --> 01:59:43,298
E deck.

1411
01:59:46,937 --> 01:59:48,131
Come on.

1412
02:00:07,794 --> 02:00:09,432
- I'm going back up.
- No.

1413
02:00:15,219 --> 02:00:18,529
Come back! I'm going back up!

1414
02:00:27,358 --> 02:00:28,791
Crew passage.

1415
02:00:51,926 --> 02:00:53,041
Jack!

1416
02:01:05,942 --> 02:01:06,978
Rose!

1417
02:01:08,070 --> 02:01:09,059
Jack!

1418
02:01:09,196 --> 02:01:10,788
Rose, I'm in here!

1419
02:01:12,241 --> 02:01:13,230
Jack!

1420
02:01:14,326 --> 02:01:15,361
- Jack!
- Rose!

1421
02:01:15,494 --> 02:01:18,055
Jack! Jack, I'm sorry.

1422
02:01:18,749 --> 02:01:20,819
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1423
02:01:21,960 --> 02:01:25,475
- That guy, Lovejoy, put it in my pocket.
- I know. I know.

1424
02:01:25,714 --> 02:01:26,863
Listen, Rose...

1425
02:01:27,007 --> 02:01:29,043
you're gonna have to find a spare key,
all right?

1426
02:01:29,218 --> 02:01:31,210
Look in that cabinet right there.

1427
02:01:31,638 --> 02:01:33,868
It's a little silver one, Rose.

1428
02:01:34,891 --> 02:01:35,880
Silver.

1429
02:01:36,559 --> 02:01:38,515
These are all brass ones!

1430
02:01:38,853 --> 02:01:40,685
Check right here, Rose.

1431
02:01:44,861 --> 02:01:46,055
Rose...

1432
02:01:47,321 --> 02:01:49,391
how'd you find out I didn't do it?

1433
02:01:49,657 --> 02:01:52,377
I didn't. I just realized I already knew.

1434
02:01:55,122 --> 02:01:56,555
Keep looking.

1435
02:02:05,467 --> 02:02:07,901
No key. There's no key!

1436
02:02:08,095 --> 02:02:09,130
All right, Rose, listen.

1437
02:02:09,262 --> 02:02:11,253
You're gonna have to go find some help.

1438
02:02:11,848 --> 02:02:13,361
It'll be all right.

1439
02:02:17,772 --> 02:02:19,444
I'll be right back.

1440
02:02:26,991 --> 02:02:28,709
I'll just wait here!

1441
02:02:41,799 --> 02:02:43,869
Hello? Is there anyone here?

1442
02:02:44,385 --> 02:02:45,500
Hello?

1443
02:02:46,387 --> 02:02:48,458
Is there anybody down here?

1444
02:02:49,224 --> 02:02:50,942
We need help! Hello?

1445
02:02:52,853 --> 02:02:54,047
Damn it.

1446
02:03:00,069 --> 02:03:02,503
Can anybody hear me, please? Hello?

1447
02:03:05,992 --> 02:03:07,220
Oh, thank God.

1448
02:03:07,410 --> 02:03:10,528
Wait, I need your help.
There's a man back here.

1449
02:03:10,998 --> 02:03:11,987
Wait!

1450
02:03:16,212 --> 02:03:17,361
Hello?

1451
02:03:43,408 --> 02:03:44,558
Hello?

1452
02:03:45,453 --> 02:03:46,886
Miss, you shouldn't be here now.

1453
02:03:47,038 --> 02:03:49,472
- I need your help.
- We'll get you topside. This way, quickly.

1454
02:03:49,666 --> 02:03:51,065
There's a man down here. He's trapped.

1455
02:03:51,209 --> 02:03:53,484
- This way. There is no need to panic.
- Please!

1456
02:03:53,670 --> 02:03:56,344
No, I'm not panicking!
You're going the wrong way!

1457
02:03:56,757 --> 02:03:58,475
Let go of me! Listen!

1458
02:04:03,890 --> 02:04:05,482
The hell with you.

1459
02:04:43,017 --> 02:04:44,370
Oh, my God.

1460
02:05:32,863 --> 02:05:33,932
Jack!

1461
02:05:34,490 --> 02:05:35,559
Rose!

1462
02:05:36,743 --> 02:05:38,222
Will this work?

1463
02:05:39,246 --> 02:05:41,476
I guess we'll find out. Come on.

1464
02:05:45,085 --> 02:05:46,154
Wait.

1465
02:05:46,503 --> 02:05:48,460
Try a couple of practice swings over there.

1466
02:05:54,513 --> 02:05:58,222
Good. Now try to hit the same mark again,
Rose. You can do it.

1467
02:06:04,232 --> 02:06:05,984
Okay. That's enough practice.

1468
02:06:06,401 --> 02:06:07,993
Come on, Rose. You can do it.

1469
02:06:08,903 --> 02:06:11,941
Listen, just hit it really hard
and really fast.

1470
02:06:14,076 --> 02:06:15,429
Come on. Wait.

1471
02:06:15,619 --> 02:06:17,211
Open your hands up a little more.

1472
02:06:17,371 --> 02:06:18,440
- Good.
- Like that?

1473
02:06:18,581 --> 02:06:19,730
Right.

1474
02:06:20,041 --> 02:06:21,998
Listen, Rose, I trust you.

1475
02:06:27,090 --> 02:06:28,079
Go.

1476
02:06:34,182 --> 02:06:35,331
You did it!

1477
02:06:35,767 --> 02:06:37,325
Come on, let's go.

1478
02:06:37,519 --> 02:06:39,350
Oh, shit, this is cold!

1479
02:06:47,655 --> 02:06:49,373
This is the way out.

1480
02:06:49,657 --> 02:06:52,125
We have to find another way. Come on.

1481
02:07:06,385 --> 02:07:08,819
Now there's something
you don't see every day.

1482
02:07:31,119 --> 02:07:34,395
What's this luggage doing here?
Get rid of it. We need the room.

1483
02:07:34,623 --> 02:07:36,181
Get rid of that! Out!

1484
02:07:36,666 --> 02:07:39,704
Come. Time for her to go, sir. Step back.

1485
02:07:39,921 --> 02:07:42,071
- Keep calm. Sit down.
- No.

1486
02:07:42,465 --> 02:07:44,820
- No!
- Make more room.

1487
02:07:46,010 --> 02:07:47,682
That's right. Look sharp.

1488
02:07:48,680 --> 02:07:49,829
Lovejoy.

1489
02:07:49,973 --> 02:07:52,090
She's not on the starboard side, either.

1490
02:07:52,476 --> 02:07:53,625
We're running out of time.

1491
02:07:53,769 --> 02:07:56,806
This strutting martinet
isn't letting any men on at all.

1492
02:07:57,189 --> 02:07:59,657
There's one on the other side
letting men on.

1493
02:07:59,859 --> 02:08:01,292
Then that's our play.

1494
02:08:01,611 --> 02:08:04,251
We'll need some insurance first. Come on.

1495
02:08:04,448 --> 02:08:07,121
Come on, this way, please.
All the way down there.

1496
02:08:09,787 --> 02:08:10,856
Here!

1497
02:08:11,705 --> 02:08:13,901
What do you think you're doing?

1498
02:08:14,084 --> 02:08:16,154
You'll have to pay for that, you know.

1499
02:08:16,378 --> 02:08:19,097
- That's White Star Line property.
- Shut up!

1500
02:08:20,924 --> 02:08:24,395
Will you hold the boat a moment?
I just have to run back to my room...

1501
02:08:24,637 --> 02:08:27,595
- Sit down.
- She's the last.

1502
02:08:27,807 --> 02:08:31,561
Mr. Lightoller,
why are the boats being launched half-full?

1503
02:08:31,811 --> 02:08:33,483
- Not now, Mr. Andrews.
- There, look.

1504
02:08:33,688 --> 02:08:36,203
Twenty or so in a boat built for 65?

1505
02:08:36,400 --> 02:08:38,755
And I saw one boat with only twelve.
Twelve!

1506
02:08:38,944 --> 02:08:41,663
We weren't sure of the weight,
Mr. Andrews.

1507
02:08:41,864 --> 02:08:44,094
- These boats may buckle.
- Rubbish!

1508
02:08:44,408 --> 02:08:46,969
They were tested in Belfast
with the weight of 70 men.

1509
02:08:47,162 --> 02:08:50,120
Now fill these boats, Mr. Lightoller.
For God's sake, man!

1510
02:08:57,381 --> 02:09:00,180
Please, I need more women and children!

1511
02:09:05,140 --> 02:09:07,495
Get back in there! This is not an exit.

1512
02:09:07,684 --> 02:09:09,243
Get back in there.

1513
02:09:11,939 --> 02:09:15,614
You can't keep us locked in here
like animals. The ship's bloody sinking.

1514
02:09:15,860 --> 02:09:17,896
Bring forward the women.

1515
02:09:18,071 --> 02:09:20,027
Unlock the gates.

1516
02:09:20,490 --> 02:09:22,129
Women only!

1517
02:09:35,674 --> 02:09:37,187
Lock the gates!

1518
02:09:45,685 --> 02:09:48,722
For God's sake, man, there are
women and children down here!

1519
02:09:48,980 --> 02:09:51,574
Let us up, so we can have a chance!

1520
02:09:51,983 --> 02:09:53,211
Get back!

1521
02:09:56,739 --> 02:09:58,013
- Jack.
- Tommy.

1522
02:09:58,157 --> 02:09:59,954
- Can we get out?
- It's hopeless that way.

1523
02:10:00,118 --> 02:10:02,154
Whatever we do, we've got to do it fast.

1524
02:10:02,370 --> 02:10:03,564
Jack!

1525
02:10:03,705 --> 02:10:04,933
Fabrizio.

1526
02:10:05,457 --> 02:10:06,731
The boats are all gone.

1527
02:10:06,876 --> 02:10:08,832
This whole place is flooding.
We've got to get out.

1528
02:10:09,003 --> 02:10:10,880
- There is niente this way.
- All right.

1529
02:10:11,088 --> 02:10:12,760
Let's go this way, all right? Come on.

1530
02:10:18,639 --> 02:10:20,914
- I make my own luck.
- So do I.

1531
02:10:29,192 --> 02:10:30,386
Come on!

1532
02:10:31,111 --> 02:10:32,624
No, come on, let's go this way.

1533
02:10:41,998 --> 02:10:43,272
This way.

1534
02:10:43,416 --> 02:10:47,534
Just go back to the main stairwell
and everything will be sorted out there.

1535
02:10:47,795 --> 02:10:48,784
The hell it will.

1536
02:10:49,172 --> 02:10:52,449
It will all get sorted out back there.
Go back to the main stairwell.

1537
02:10:52,718 --> 02:10:54,709
- Open the gate.
- Go back down the main stairwell.

1538
02:10:54,887 --> 02:10:55,876
Open the gate right now.

1539
02:10:56,013 --> 02:10:58,368
Go back down the main stairwell
like I told you!

1540
02:11:00,685 --> 02:11:03,280
God damn it! Son of a bitch!

1541
02:11:03,563 --> 02:11:04,837
Stop that!

1542
02:11:05,065 --> 02:11:06,817
Open the damn gate!

1543
02:11:09,570 --> 02:11:10,764
Fabri, Tommy, give me hand here.

1544
02:11:10,904 --> 02:11:13,055
- Move aside. Move aside!
- Pull!

1545
02:11:14,284 --> 02:11:15,353
Pull!

1546
02:11:16,161 --> 02:11:18,311
- Move aside.
- Put that down!

1547
02:11:18,496 --> 02:11:20,134
- Move aside!
- Put that down!

1548
02:11:20,290 --> 02:11:22,326
- One! Two!
- Stop that!

1549
02:11:22,626 --> 02:11:23,615
Three!

1550
02:11:25,880 --> 02:11:26,869
Again!

1551
02:11:29,133 --> 02:11:30,361
Let's go!

1552
02:11:32,428 --> 02:11:33,463
Let's go, Rose.

1553
02:11:33,596 --> 02:11:35,792
You can't go up there! You can't do this!

1554
02:11:42,565 --> 02:11:44,237
Keep order here!

1555
02:11:44,400 --> 02:11:46,517
Get back. Get back!

1556
02:11:51,700 --> 02:11:53,179
Hold on to her!

1557
02:11:54,244 --> 02:11:55,393
Pull her in.

1558
02:11:56,121 --> 02:11:58,192
Get back, I say...

1559
02:11:58,500 --> 02:12:00,968
or I'll shoot you all like dogs!

1560
02:12:01,169 --> 02:12:02,397
Keep order here!

1561
02:12:04,089 --> 02:12:05,602
Keep order, I say.

1562
02:12:07,300 --> 02:12:09,178
Mr. Lowe, man this boat.

1563
02:12:13,683 --> 02:12:14,752
Right.

1564
02:12:14,892 --> 02:12:17,645
Is everybody all right? Nobody panic.

1565
02:12:24,111 --> 02:12:25,339
Stay back!

1566
02:12:26,113 --> 02:12:27,262
We're too late.

1567
02:12:27,406 --> 02:12:29,283
There are more boats down the front.

1568
02:12:29,450 --> 02:12:32,488
Stay with this one. Murdoch.
He seems to be quite practical.

1569
02:12:34,623 --> 02:12:36,102
Stop lowering!

1570
02:12:37,334 --> 02:12:38,562
Stop lowering!

1571
02:12:38,961 --> 02:12:40,280
Cut the falls!

1572
02:12:47,303 --> 02:12:48,622
Sit down!

1573
02:12:49,764 --> 02:12:52,153
Stay back, you lot! Just stay back!

1574
02:12:52,475 --> 02:12:54,910
Stay back, the lot of you! Just stay back!

1575
02:12:57,648 --> 02:13:00,208
It's starting to fall apart.
We don't have much time.

1576
02:13:01,819 --> 02:13:03,013
Mr. Murdoch?

1577
02:13:03,196 --> 02:13:05,870
Mr. Hockley. You two, with me, now!

1578
02:13:06,325 --> 02:13:09,522
I'm a businessman, as you know,
I have a business proposition for you.

1579
02:13:17,379 --> 02:13:18,528
Come on, Rose.

1580
02:13:22,009 --> 02:13:23,761
The boats are gone!

1581
02:13:28,683 --> 02:13:30,275
Colonel, are there any boats on that side?

1582
02:13:30,435 --> 02:13:32,824
No, miss, but there are a couple of boats
all the way forward.

1583
02:13:33,021 --> 02:13:34,579
This way, I'll lead you.

1584
02:13:40,905 --> 02:13:43,578
What's the use?
Nobody's listening to us anyway.

1585
02:13:44,242 --> 02:13:48,030
They don't listen to us at dinner, either.
Come on, let's play. Keep us warm.

1586
02:13:49,622 --> 02:13:50,738
Orpheus.

1587
02:13:55,754 --> 02:13:58,587
Music to drown by.
Now I know I'm in first class.

1588
02:14:03,972 --> 02:14:06,930
- Where is everyone?
- They're all still aft, sir.

1589
02:14:07,267 --> 02:14:08,746
Come on, madam, don't cry.

1590
02:14:09,561 --> 02:14:11,756
We have an understanding, then,
Mr. Murdoch.

1591
02:14:22,992 --> 02:14:26,781
Will the men please hold back?
Hold back, I say!

1592
02:14:29,625 --> 02:14:33,174
Women and children only! Get back!

1593
02:14:33,796 --> 02:14:35,867
I said, step back, sir.
Come through, madam.

1594
02:14:36,050 --> 02:14:37,847
This way. Step back, sir!

1595
02:14:38,010 --> 02:14:38,999
Let the women-

1596
02:14:39,136 --> 02:14:41,172
You better check the other side. Go!

1597
02:14:49,105 --> 02:14:52,620
I found her, on the other side.
Waiting for a boat...

1598
02:14:53,443 --> 02:14:54,592
with him.

1599
02:14:55,862 --> 02:14:58,502
- Any more women and children?
- They're all aboard, Mr. Murdoch.

1600
02:14:58,700 --> 02:15:00,213
Anyone else then?

1601
02:15:01,286 --> 02:15:02,639
- Hop on, sir.
- Anyone else?

1602
02:15:02,787 --> 02:15:04,618
Do hurry. Hurry along.

1603
02:15:08,042 --> 02:15:09,396
Stand by the falls.

1604
02:15:09,545 --> 02:15:11,342
God damn it all to hell.

1605
02:15:14,008 --> 02:15:15,043
Shit.

1606
02:15:15,176 --> 02:15:16,165
Fire!

1607
02:15:17,386 --> 02:15:19,582
Sir, you can't go through here.

1608
02:15:20,057 --> 02:15:21,854
Sir, you can't go through.

1609
02:15:23,769 --> 02:15:25,725
That's it. Splendid. Right.

1610
02:15:30,192 --> 02:15:31,546
Prepare to lower!

1611
02:15:33,947 --> 02:15:35,539
Ready on the left!

1612
02:15:41,705 --> 02:15:43,025
Take them down.

1613
02:15:48,129 --> 02:15:49,403
Keep it steady.

1614
02:15:52,008 --> 02:15:55,319
Both sides together.
Steady. Keep it steady.

1615
02:15:57,056 --> 02:15:59,126
- Give her to me.
- Daddy.

1616
02:15:59,517 --> 02:16:02,077
- It'll be fine, darling. Don't you worry.
- Take her.

1617
02:16:02,270 --> 02:16:03,988
Daddy, get in the boat.

1618
02:16:04,146 --> 02:16:07,457
It's goodbye for a little while.
Only for a little while.

1619
02:16:07,693 --> 02:16:09,331
There'll be another boat for the daddies...

1620
02:16:09,486 --> 02:16:11,158
this boat's for the mommies
and the children.

1621
02:16:11,321 --> 02:16:14,074
You hold Mommy's hand
and be a good little girl.

1622
02:16:14,908 --> 02:16:16,103
I'm not going without you.

1623
02:16:16,244 --> 02:16:18,553
- No. You have to go, now.
- No, Jack.

1624
02:16:18,997 --> 02:16:20,555
Get in the boat, Rose.

1625
02:16:20,707 --> 02:16:21,696
No, Jack.

1626
02:16:21,833 --> 02:16:23,551
Yes. Get on the boat.

1627
02:16:23,835 --> 02:16:25,712
Yes, get on the boat, Rose.

1628
02:16:29,008 --> 02:16:31,647
My God. Look at you. You look a fright.

1629
02:16:32,303 --> 02:16:33,338
Here.

1630
02:16:35,056 --> 02:16:37,092
Put this on. Come on.

1631
02:16:42,732 --> 02:16:44,563
Go on. I'll get the next one.

1632
02:16:44,734 --> 02:16:46,611
No, not without you.

1633
02:16:46,777 --> 02:16:48,733
I'll be all right. Listen, I'll be fine.

1634
02:16:48,904 --> 02:16:50,941
I'm a survivor, all right?
Don't worry about me.

1635
02:16:51,116 --> 02:16:52,310
Now, go on. Get on.

1636
02:16:52,451 --> 02:16:55,090
I have an arrangement with an officer
on the other side of the ship.

1637
02:16:55,287 --> 02:16:57,676
Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.

1638
02:16:59,291 --> 02:17:01,487
See? I got my own boat to catch.

1639
02:17:01,670 --> 02:17:04,230
- Go.
- Come on, hurry. They're almost full.

1640
02:17:05,674 --> 02:17:06,709
Step aboard, miss.

1641
02:17:06,841 --> 02:17:08,194
- Go.
- Come on, hurry.

1642
02:17:09,094 --> 02:17:11,130
- Step aboard, please.
- You're Daddy's good girl.

1643
02:17:11,304 --> 02:17:13,455
- Step lively!
- Keep back.

1644
02:17:13,683 --> 02:17:15,321
Keep back, I say.

1645
02:17:17,228 --> 02:17:18,946
Clear the rail, please.

1646
02:17:20,064 --> 02:17:21,338
Lower away!

1647
02:17:25,112 --> 02:17:26,340
Steady.

1648
02:17:29,325 --> 02:17:31,395
And lower away evenly, lads.

1649
02:17:32,244 --> 02:17:33,233
Easy.

1650
02:17:33,746 --> 02:17:34,975
Lower away.

1651
02:17:35,123 --> 02:17:36,841
You're a good liar.

1652
02:17:37,084 --> 02:17:38,312
Almost as good as you.

1653
02:17:38,460 --> 02:17:41,133
Easy, now. And lower away.

1654
02:17:43,632 --> 02:17:46,705
There's no... There's no arrangement,
is there?

1655
02:17:48,555 --> 02:17:50,068
No, there is.

1656
02:17:50,348 --> 02:17:52,498
Not that you'll benefit much from it.

1657
02:17:52,684 --> 02:17:53,878
And even away.

1658
02:17:54,352 --> 02:17:55,341
I always win, Jack.

1659
02:17:55,478 --> 02:17:57,276
And lower away evenly, lads.

1660
02:17:57,440 --> 02:17:58,509
One way or another.

1661
02:17:58,649 --> 02:18:01,322
Watch that trim. Trim that boat.

1662
02:18:02,570 --> 02:18:03,559
Easy.

1663
02:18:04,614 --> 02:18:05,888
Even, lads.

1664
02:18:06,574 --> 02:18:09,203
Keep going!

1665
02:18:56,964 --> 02:18:58,033
Rose!

1666
02:19:00,342 --> 02:19:01,741
- Stop her!
- Rose!

1667
02:19:02,136 --> 02:19:04,048
- What are you doing?
- Stop her!

1668
02:19:05,140 --> 02:19:06,175
No!

1669
02:19:24,536 --> 02:19:25,651
Rose!

1670
02:19:29,125 --> 02:19:31,798
You're so stupid! Why did you do that?

1671
02:19:32,336 --> 02:19:34,008
You're so stupid, Rose.

1672
02:19:35,882 --> 02:19:37,794
Why did you do that? Why?

1673
02:19:38,469 --> 02:19:40,346
You jump, I jump, right?

1674
02:19:42,598 --> 02:19:43,633
Right.

1675
02:19:45,810 --> 02:19:46,959
Oh, God.

1676
02:19:47,102 --> 02:19:49,492
I couldn't go. I couldn't go, Jack.

1677
02:19:50,190 --> 02:19:52,545
It's all right. We'll think of something.

1678
02:19:53,568 --> 02:19:55,604
At least I'm with you.

1679
02:20:09,336 --> 02:20:10,655
Come on! Move!

1680
02:20:11,756 --> 02:20:12,984
Come on!

1681
02:20:13,925 --> 02:20:15,517
Come on! Move!

1682
02:20:21,933 --> 02:20:23,083
Come on!

1683
02:20:30,985 --> 02:20:32,020
Move!

1684
02:20:38,243 --> 02:20:39,642
Come on, come on, Rose!

1685
02:20:42,122 --> 02:20:43,521
Rose, come on!

1686
02:20:46,377 --> 02:20:47,446
Move, Rose!

1687
02:20:50,632 --> 02:20:51,667
Go!

1688
02:21:02,061 --> 02:21:04,211
I hope you enjoy your time together!

1689
02:21:18,872 --> 02:21:20,669
What could possibly be funny?

1690
02:21:21,666 --> 02:21:23,816
I put the diamond in the coat.

1691
02:21:26,922 --> 02:21:28,913
And I put the coat on her!

1692
02:21:30,593 --> 02:21:31,787
Come on.

1693
02:21:50,948 --> 02:21:52,621
Dada!

1694
02:21:55,871 --> 02:21:57,270
We can't leave him.

1695
02:22:01,502 --> 02:22:02,935
All right, come on!

1696
02:22:04,756 --> 02:22:06,587
Dada!

1697
02:22:19,564 --> 02:22:20,633
Go back!

1698
02:22:31,661 --> 02:22:33,856
That's the wrong way! Come back!

1699
02:22:40,712 --> 02:22:41,701
Go!

1700
02:22:44,174 --> 02:22:45,209
Go!

1701
02:22:46,176 --> 02:22:47,529
Run, Rose!

1702
02:22:55,020 --> 02:22:56,009
Jack!

1703
02:22:59,399 --> 02:23:00,833
- Jack!
- Rose!

1704
02:23:13,708 --> 02:23:14,777
This way!

1705
02:23:24,219 --> 02:23:25,208
Come on!

1706
02:23:26,638 --> 02:23:27,957
Give me your hand!

1707
02:23:36,816 --> 02:23:38,135
Oh, God!

1708
02:23:42,697 --> 02:23:43,732
Help!

1709
02:23:49,539 --> 02:23:50,654
Help!

1710
02:23:52,709 --> 02:23:55,018
Wait, sir! Sir, open the gate, please!

1711
02:23:55,211 --> 02:23:57,601
- Please!
- Please, help us!

1712
02:23:57,965 --> 02:23:59,478
- Please!
- Please!

1713
02:24:00,801 --> 02:24:01,950
Bloody hell!

1714
02:24:05,389 --> 02:24:06,378
Hurry.

1715
02:24:07,893 --> 02:24:09,645
- Come on, come on!
- Come on!

1716
02:24:10,270 --> 02:24:11,419
Go, go!

1717
02:24:11,563 --> 02:24:12,632
Jesus.

1718
02:24:13,524 --> 02:24:14,843
- Please!
- Come on!

1719
02:24:15,234 --> 02:24:16,223
Hurry!

1720
02:24:16,652 --> 02:24:17,687
Come on!

1721
02:24:23,076 --> 02:24:24,748
I'm sorry, I dropped the keys.

1722
02:24:25,579 --> 02:24:26,853
- Wait, please!
- Wait!

1723
02:24:28,248 --> 02:24:31,082
Don't leave! Please, send for help!

1724
02:24:49,647 --> 02:24:51,718
I got it! Which one is it, Rose?

1725
02:24:52,109 --> 02:24:53,986
The short one. Try the short one.

1726
02:24:55,070 --> 02:24:56,344
Hurry, Jack.

1727
02:24:59,616 --> 02:25:01,607
Oh, no! No, it won't go in.

1728
02:25:01,952 --> 02:25:03,181
Hurry, Jack.

1729
02:25:05,874 --> 02:25:07,865
It's stuck! It's stuck!

1730
02:25:08,793 --> 02:25:10,704
- Come on!
- Hurry, Jack!

1731
02:25:12,130 --> 02:25:13,609
Hurry, Jack!

1732
02:25:16,469 --> 02:25:18,744
I got it! Go, Rose!

1733
02:25:19,764 --> 02:25:21,197
Go!

1734
02:25:31,360 --> 02:25:32,634
Jack!

1735
02:25:34,739 --> 02:25:36,138
Come on!

1736
02:25:37,576 --> 02:25:38,850
Move, move.

1737
02:25:49,005 --> 02:25:52,042
- Get those oars in place.
- Get an oar under it.

1738
02:25:52,926 --> 02:25:55,121
Women and children only, damn you!

1739
02:25:56,054 --> 02:25:58,614
Hold it!

1740
02:26:09,402 --> 02:26:13,316
Get these davits cranked in!
Let's get the falls hooked up!

1741
02:26:22,668 --> 02:26:23,896
Stay back!

1742
02:26:25,837 --> 02:26:27,156
Mommy!

1743
02:26:27,839 --> 02:26:29,431
Stay back, sir!

1744
02:26:30,968 --> 02:26:32,607
Stay back, I say.

1745
02:26:34,180 --> 02:26:35,613
Keep going up!

1746
02:26:38,560 --> 02:26:40,118
Stop pushing!

1747
02:26:41,187 --> 02:26:43,178
Stay back!

1748
02:26:43,356 --> 02:26:46,030
Will you give us a chance to live,
you limey bastard?

1749
02:26:46,235 --> 02:26:48,954
I'll shoot any man
who tries to get past me! Get back!

1750
02:26:49,155 --> 02:26:50,224
Bastard!

1751
02:26:50,364 --> 02:26:51,638
Get back!

1752
02:26:52,366 --> 02:26:54,277
We had a deal, damn it!

1753
02:26:56,789 --> 02:27:00,668
Your money can't save you anymore
than it can save me. Get back!

1754
02:27:02,086 --> 02:27:03,804
Women and children only!

1755
02:27:06,383 --> 02:27:07,657
Stop pushing!

1756
02:27:09,928 --> 02:27:11,202
No, Tommy!

1757
02:27:11,805 --> 02:27:13,557
No! No, Tommy!

1758
02:27:14,349 --> 02:27:15,577
Bastardo!

1759
02:27:33,287 --> 02:27:34,515
No, Will!

1760
02:27:41,338 --> 02:27:42,327
Now stand back, damn you!

1761
02:27:46,343 --> 02:27:48,652
Gently, hold it.

1762
02:27:59,232 --> 02:28:00,824
I have a child!

1763
02:28:02,027 --> 02:28:03,620
Clear a path!

1764
02:28:03,780 --> 02:28:05,691
Please, I have a child.

1765
02:28:06,533 --> 02:28:09,001
Please, I'm all she has in the world.

1766
02:28:09,953 --> 02:28:10,988
Go on.

1767
02:28:11,413 --> 02:28:12,846
Step back!

1768
02:28:12,997 --> 02:28:13,987
Please!

1769
02:28:14,125 --> 02:28:16,081
Here. Give her to me.

1770
02:28:22,175 --> 02:28:23,893
There, there.

1771
02:28:27,931 --> 02:28:30,320
Wait! Mr. Andrews.

1772
02:28:33,020 --> 02:28:34,248
Oh, Rose.

1773
02:28:36,942 --> 02:28:39,172
Won't you even make a try for it?

1774
02:28:40,529 --> 02:28:44,283
I'm sorry that I didn't build you
a stronger ship, young Rose.

1775
02:28:47,160 --> 02:28:49,152
It's going fast. We have to move.

1776
02:28:49,330 --> 02:28:50,365
Wait.

1777
02:28:53,543 --> 02:28:55,374
Good luck to you, Rose.

1778
02:28:56,963 --> 02:28:58,237
And to you.

1779
02:29:10,687 --> 02:29:13,406
Mr. Guggenheim? These are for you.

1780
02:29:13,607 --> 02:29:16,121
No, thank you.
We are dressed in our best...

1781
02:29:16,318 --> 02:29:18,912
and are prepared to go down
as gentlemen.

1782
02:29:19,822 --> 02:29:21,461
But we would like a brandy.

1783
02:29:22,284 --> 02:29:24,161
Get the falls over here!

1784
02:29:24,995 --> 02:29:27,429
Make them taut. Then we'll right it!

1785
02:29:34,172 --> 02:29:37,164
Capitán, where should I go? Please.

1786
02:29:43,349 --> 02:29:45,909
Captain. Sir.

1787
02:30:17,095 --> 02:30:18,972
Right. That's it, then.

1788
02:30:20,098 --> 02:30:22,134
Goodbye, Wally, good luck.

1789
02:30:22,559 --> 02:30:25,073
- Goodbye, Wallace.
- So long, old chap.

1790
02:31:39,144 --> 02:31:42,773
And so they lived happily together
for 300 years...

1791
02:31:44,065 --> 02:31:46,499
in the land of Tir na nOg...

1792
02:31:46,903 --> 02:31:49,212
land of eternal youth and beauty.

1793
02:32:25,236 --> 02:32:27,989
There's no time! Cut the falls!

1794
02:32:28,198 --> 02:32:30,553
Cut them if you have to!

1795
02:32:31,284 --> 02:32:33,515
I need a knife!

1796
02:32:35,206 --> 02:32:38,596
Cut the falls now! Cut them loose!

1797
02:32:50,014 --> 02:32:51,811
Cut those bloody falls!

1798
02:33:39,361 --> 02:33:43,036
Gentlemen, it has been a privilege
playing with you tonight.

1799
02:34:44,224 --> 02:34:46,261
We have to stay on the ship
as long as possible.

1800
02:34:46,435 --> 02:34:47,629
Come on.

1801
02:34:59,616 --> 02:35:01,527
This way. Hold the rail.

1802
02:35:03,495 --> 02:35:05,690
Come on, Rose. Jump.

1803
02:35:08,334 --> 02:35:09,484
Come on.

1804
02:35:42,998 --> 02:35:44,636
I got you. Jump!

1805
02:35:47,252 --> 02:35:48,970
I've got you, miss.

1806
02:35:49,505 --> 02:35:50,904
- Jack!
- What?

1807
02:35:52,841 --> 02:35:53,877
Back!

1808
02:36:24,085 --> 02:36:25,757
No, you'll swamp us!

1809
02:36:34,179 --> 02:36:35,453
Nobody panic.

1810
02:36:38,852 --> 02:36:41,924
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death-

1811
02:36:42,147 --> 02:36:44,820
You want to walk a little faster
through that valley, there?

1812
02:37:34,956 --> 02:37:37,424
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us, sinners...

1813
02:37:37,625 --> 02:37:39,934
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

1814
02:37:40,128 --> 02:37:41,561
Hail Mary, full of grace...

1815
02:37:41,713 --> 02:37:42,907
This way.

1816
02:37:54,018 --> 02:37:55,417
Come on!

1817
02:38:04,822 --> 02:38:07,052
And I saw a new heaven and a new Earth.

1818
02:38:07,241 --> 02:38:10,552
For the first heaven
and the first Earth had passed away...

1819
02:38:12,038 --> 02:38:14,029
and there was no more sea.

1820
02:38:19,964 --> 02:38:23,001
It'll be over soon. It'll all be over soon.

1821
02:38:29,057 --> 02:38:30,650
And he shall dwell with them...

1822
02:38:30,810 --> 02:38:32,528
and they shall be his people...

1823
02:38:32,686 --> 02:38:36,122
and God himself shall be with them
and be their God.

1824
02:38:37,441 --> 02:38:38,635
Jack...

1825
02:38:39,527 --> 02:38:41,006
this is where we first met.

1826
02:38:48,454 --> 02:38:51,764
And God shall wipe away
all the tears from their eyes...

1827
02:38:51,999 --> 02:38:54,275
and there shall be no more death...

1828
02:38:54,961 --> 02:38:57,475
neither shall there be sorrow or crying...

1829
02:38:57,672 --> 02:39:00,140
neither shall there be any more pain...

1830
02:39:00,634 --> 02:39:03,102
for the former world has passed away.

1831
02:39:18,112 --> 02:39:20,307
Bloody pull faster! And pull!

1832
02:39:43,765 --> 02:39:45,198
Hang on, Miss Trudy!

1833
02:40:20,973 --> 02:40:22,611
Hold on real tight.

1834
02:40:40,286 --> 02:40:41,685
God almighty!

1835
02:40:49,255 --> 02:40:51,610
Keep those breakers in! Keep them in!

1836
02:42:10,970 --> 02:42:12,528
We have to move!

1837
02:42:18,020 --> 02:42:19,897
Give me your hand, I'll pull you over.

1838
02:42:20,314 --> 02:42:22,305
Come on, give me your hand.

1839
02:42:24,735 --> 02:42:26,852
I've got you. I won't let go.

1840
02:42:27,030 --> 02:42:28,019
Come on, I've got you.

1841
02:42:39,627 --> 02:42:42,141
- What's happening, Jack?
- I don't know.

1842
02:42:51,807 --> 02:42:53,365
- Hold on!
- Jack!

1843
02:42:56,562 --> 02:42:58,712
Somebody help me, please!

1844
02:43:35,356 --> 02:43:36,675
This is it!

1845
02:43:48,829 --> 02:43:51,059
Oh, my God, Jack!

1846
02:43:52,333 --> 02:43:53,527
Hold on!

1847
02:44:08,726 --> 02:44:10,956
The ship is gonna suck us down.

1848
02:44:11,354 --> 02:44:12,946
Take a deep breath when I say.

1849
02:44:18,696 --> 02:44:21,051
Kick for the surface and keep kicking.

1850
02:44:21,240 --> 02:44:22,719
Do not let go of my hand.

1851
02:44:30,083 --> 02:44:32,551
We're going to make it, Rose. Trust me.

1852
02:44:32,753 --> 02:44:34,072
I trust you.

1853
02:44:38,800 --> 02:44:42,032
Ready? Now!

1854
02:45:18,970 --> 02:45:20,722
Jack!

1855
02:45:24,726 --> 02:45:26,080
- Rose!
- Jack!

1856
02:45:30,774 --> 02:45:31,763
Jack!

1857
02:45:52,507 --> 02:45:54,099
Jack!

1858
02:46:05,229 --> 02:46:06,742
Get off her!

1859
02:46:10,526 --> 02:46:11,676
- Rose!
- Jack!

1860
02:46:11,820 --> 02:46:14,050
Swim, Rose! I need you to swim!

1861
02:46:18,035 --> 02:46:19,468
Keep swimming.

1862
02:46:23,416 --> 02:46:25,646
- It's so cold.
- Swim, Rose!

1863
02:46:31,216 --> 02:46:32,935
Come on. Here.

1864
02:46:34,429 --> 02:46:36,579
Keep swimming. Come on.

1865
02:46:39,058 --> 02:46:40,650
Here, get on it.

1866
02:46:42,062 --> 02:46:43,495
Get on top.

1867
02:46:51,030 --> 02:46:52,463
Come on, Rose.

1868
02:47:01,917 --> 02:47:03,828
Stay on it. Stay on, Rose.

1869
02:47:25,443 --> 02:47:27,274
It'll be all right now.

1870
02:47:29,490 --> 02:47:31,208
You'll be all right now.

1871
02:47:38,541 --> 02:47:41,420
Return the boats!

1872
02:47:45,549 --> 02:47:47,938
The boats are coming back for us, Rose.

1873
02:47:48,344 --> 02:47:50,460
Hold on just a little bit longer.

1874
02:47:50,638 --> 02:47:53,199
They had to row away for the suction...

1875
02:47:54,601 --> 02:47:56,796
but now they'll be coming back.

1876
02:47:58,563 --> 02:47:59,882
For God's sake!

1877
02:48:00,023 --> 02:48:03,016
Please help us!

1878
02:48:08,491 --> 02:48:10,209
You don't understand.

1879
02:48:10,994 --> 02:48:15,113
If we go back, they'll swamp the boat.
They'll pull us right down, I'm telling you.

1880
02:48:15,374 --> 02:48:17,729
Knock it off. You're scaring me.

1881
02:48:18,169 --> 02:48:20,763
Come on, girls, grab an oar. Let's go.

1882
02:48:20,963 --> 02:48:24,239
Are you out of your mind?
We're in the middle of the North Atlantic.

1883
02:48:24,467 --> 02:48:27,744
Now, do you people want to live
or do you want to die?

1884
02:48:34,603 --> 02:48:36,834
I don't understand a one of you.

1885
02:48:38,692 --> 02:48:41,889
What's the matter with you?
It's your men out there!

1886
02:48:44,823 --> 02:48:46,461
There's plenty of room for more.

1887
02:48:46,616 --> 02:48:48,448
And there'll be one less on this boat.

1888
02:48:48,619 --> 02:48:51,338
If you don't shut that hole in your face!

1889
02:49:07,598 --> 02:49:09,554
Bring in your oars over there.

1890
02:49:09,725 --> 02:49:12,240
Tie these two boats together as well.

1891
02:49:16,191 --> 02:49:18,910
Now, make sure that's tied up
nice and tight.

1892
02:49:22,365 --> 02:49:24,754
Right, listen to me, men.
We have to go back.

1893
02:49:24,951 --> 02:49:28,466
I want to transfer all the women
from this boat into that boat right now.

1894
02:49:28,705 --> 02:49:30,024
As quick as you can, please.

1895
02:49:30,165 --> 02:49:32,634
Let's create some space over there.
Move forward and out.

1896
02:49:42,512 --> 02:49:44,185
It's getting quiet.

1897
02:49:46,642 --> 02:49:51,352
It's just going to take a couple of minutes
to get the boats organized.

1898
02:49:55,193 --> 02:49:57,024
I don't know about you...

1899
02:49:57,195 --> 02:50:00,949
but I intend to write
a strongly-worded letter...

1900
02:50:01,200 --> 02:50:03,668
to the White Star Line about all this.

1901
02:50:10,961 --> 02:50:12,553
I love you, Jack.

1902
02:50:19,303 --> 02:50:20,895
Don't you do that.

1903
02:50:22,306 --> 02:50:24,422
Don't you say your goodbyes.

1904
02:50:24,976 --> 02:50:27,092
Not yet. Do you understand me?

1905
02:50:27,812 --> 02:50:29,166
I'm so cold.

1906
02:50:30,149 --> 02:50:31,582
Listen, Rose...

1907
02:50:32,776 --> 02:50:34,653
you're gonna get out of here.

1908
02:50:35,529 --> 02:50:37,247
You're gonna go on...

1909
02:50:37,823 --> 02:50:40,418
and you're gonna make lots of babies.

1910
02:50:40,994 --> 02:50:43,110
And you're gonna watch them grow.

1911
02:50:44,498 --> 02:50:48,457
You're gonna die an old lady,
warm in her bed.

1912
02:50:50,921 --> 02:50:52,116
Not here.

1913
02:50:52,757 --> 02:50:54,236
Not this night.

1914
02:50:54,718 --> 02:50:57,152
Not like this. Do you understand me?

1915
02:51:00,223 --> 02:51:01,941
I can't feel my body.

1916
02:51:04,228 --> 02:51:08,016
Winning that ticket was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1917
02:51:10,068 --> 02:51:11,786
It brought me to you.

1918
02:51:13,572 --> 02:51:15,802
And I'm thankful for that, Rose.

1919
02:51:16,617 --> 02:51:18,016
I'm thankful.

1920
02:51:20,204 --> 02:51:22,593
You must...

1921
02:51:23,874 --> 02:51:25,433
do me this honor.

1922
02:51:28,672 --> 02:51:31,470
You must promise me that you'll survive.

1923
02:51:33,093 --> 02:51:35,402
That you won't give up...

1924
02:51:36,848 --> 02:51:38,725
no matter what happens.

1925
02:51:41,353 --> 02:51:43,309
No matter how hopeless.

1926
02:51:47,151 --> 02:51:48,869
Promise me now, Rose.

1927
02:51:51,489 --> 02:51:53,798
And never let go of that promise.

1928
02:51:55,284 --> 02:51:56,558
I promise.

1929
02:51:58,956 --> 02:52:00,389
Never let go.

1930
02:52:03,377 --> 02:52:05,288
I'll never let go, Jack.

1931
02:52:08,299 --> 02:52:09,892
I'll never let go.

1932
02:52:34,120 --> 02:52:35,712
Right ahead, sir.

1933
02:52:38,875 --> 02:52:39,910
Oars!

1934
02:52:40,710 --> 02:52:42,507
Do you see any moving?

1935
02:52:43,505 --> 02:52:45,416
No, sir. None moving, sir.

1936
02:52:46,050 --> 02:52:47,369
Check them.

1937
02:52:47,760 --> 02:52:49,591
Bring that oar up here.

1938
02:52:55,727 --> 02:52:57,558
Check them. Make sure.

1939
02:52:58,021 --> 02:52:59,773
These are dead, sir.

1940
02:53:00,357 --> 02:53:02,632
Now give way. Ahead easy.

1941
02:53:09,742 --> 02:53:12,415
Careful with your oars. Don't hit them.

1942
02:53:15,457 --> 02:53:17,688
Is there anyone alive out there?

1943
02:53:19,378 --> 02:53:21,289
Can anyone hear me?

1944
02:53:23,341 --> 02:53:25,571
Is there anyone alive out there?

1945
02:53:32,685 --> 02:53:34,164
We waited too long.

1946
02:53:38,232 --> 02:53:40,588
Keep checking them! Keep looking!

1947
02:53:42,112 --> 02:53:44,342
Is there anyone alive out there?

1948
02:53:48,076 --> 02:53:49,748
Can anyone hear me?

1949
02:54:05,263 --> 02:54:08,494
In my flying machine

1950
02:54:10,434 --> 02:54:13,074
And up she goes

1951
02:54:15,607 --> 02:54:17,120
Up she goes

1952
02:54:22,698 --> 02:54:25,088
Come, Josephine

1953
02:54:27,954 --> 02:54:31,310
In my flying machine

1954
02:54:54,025 --> 02:54:55,060
Jack?

1955
02:55:14,881 --> 02:55:16,360
There's a boat.

1956
02:55:16,967 --> 02:55:18,002
Jack?

1957
02:55:43,372 --> 02:55:45,090
There's a boat, Jack.

1958
02:56:28,922 --> 02:56:30,196
Come back.

1959
02:56:40,060 --> 02:56:41,334
Come back!

1960
02:56:46,233 --> 02:56:47,871
Hello!

1961
02:56:49,444 --> 02:56:51,276
Can anyone hear me?

1962
02:56:52,323 --> 02:56:54,279
There's nothing here, sir.

1963
02:56:56,244 --> 02:56:57,518
Come back.

1964
02:57:08,215 --> 02:57:10,968
I'll never let go. I promise.

1965
02:57:54,809 --> 02:57:56,128
Come about!

1966
02:58:17,709 --> 02:58:20,907
Fifteen hundred people went into the sea...

1967
02:58:21,589 --> 02:58:24,422
when Titanic sank from under us.

1968
02:58:26,677 --> 02:58:29,430
There were 20 boats floating nearby...

1969
02:58:30,932 --> 02:58:32,810
and only one came back.

1970
02:58:35,187 --> 02:58:36,176
One.

1971
02:58:38,023 --> 02:58:40,457
Six were saved from the water...

1972
02:58:40,943 --> 02:58:42,502
myself included.

1973
02:58:44,031 --> 02:58:48,309
Six out of 1,500.

1974
02:58:51,788 --> 02:58:55,941
Afterward, the 700 people in the boats...

1975
02:58:56,503 --> 02:58:58,812
had nothing to do but wait.

1976
02:59:00,757 --> 02:59:03,749
Wait to die, wait to live.

1977
02:59:05,429 --> 02:59:07,499
Wait for an absolution...

1978
02:59:08,099 --> 02:59:10,010
that would never come.

1979
03:00:14,339 --> 03:00:16,614
Sir, I don't think you'll find
any of your people down here.

1980
03:00:16,800 --> 03:00:18,392
It's all steerage.

1981
03:00:23,558 --> 03:00:26,391
His hair is reddish brown,
and a white beard.

1982
03:00:26,644 --> 03:00:29,442
- Isn't there another passenger list?
- There's no other list.

1983
03:00:29,647 --> 03:00:32,957
- Perhaps he's on another ship.
- We're doing all we can.

1984
03:00:56,803 --> 03:00:59,317
That's the last time I ever saw him.

1985
03:00:59,639 --> 03:01:02,711
He married, of course,
and inherited his millions.

1986
03:01:04,061 --> 03:01:07,178
But the crash of '29 hit his interests hard.

1987
03:01:07,731 --> 03:01:10,292
And he put a pistol in his mouth that year.

1988
03:01:10,735 --> 03:01:12,134
Or so I read.

1989
03:01:25,334 --> 03:01:27,450
Can I take your name, please, love?

1990
03:01:29,922 --> 03:01:31,038
Dawson.

1991
03:01:33,427 --> 03:01:34,780
Rose Dawson.

1992
03:01:35,971 --> 03:01:37,245
Thank you.

1993
03:01:44,272 --> 03:01:48,106
We never found anything on Jack.
There's no record of him at all.

1994
03:01:49,277 --> 03:01:51,154
No, there wouldn't be, would there?

1995
03:01:51,905 --> 03:01:56,422
And I've never spoken of him until now.
Not to anyone.

1996
03:01:57,453 --> 03:01:59,523
Not even your grandfather.

1997
03:01:59,914 --> 03:02:03,190
A woman's heart
is a deep ocean of secrets.

1998
03:02:04,712 --> 03:02:07,988
But now you know
there was a man named Jack Dawson...

1999
03:02:08,633 --> 03:02:10,430
and that he saved me...

2000
03:02:11,010 --> 03:02:13,763
in every way that a person can be saved.

2001
03:02:16,225 --> 03:02:18,614
I don't even have a picture of him.

2002
03:02:21,397 --> 03:02:25,106
He exists now only in my memory.

2003
03:02:30,323 --> 03:02:33,042
Keldysh, Mir-2 on our way to the surface.

2004
03:02:50,346 --> 03:02:53,258
I was saving this
for when I found the diamond.

2005
03:03:02,526 --> 03:03:03,800
I'm sorry.

2006
03:03:06,655 --> 03:03:07,974
Three years.

2007
03:03:08,699 --> 03:03:11,339
I've thought of nothing except Titanic.

2008
03:03:12,078 --> 03:03:13,796
But I never got it.

2009
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:18,592
I never let it in.
