謝謝 鮑勃
Thank you, Bob.

18
00:04:14,563 --> 00:04:17,555
鮑勃對我一片溢美之詞
Bob has very generously referred to me...

19
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:20,067
說我是南方新巨擘
as part of the cream of the new South.

20
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:24,231
這種話我承受不起
I think that might be a little bit genteel for me.

21
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:28,640
要我形容我自己 我不過是個
I would be more inclined to consider myself more of...

22
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,407
中西部來的邊緣混混而已
oh, skim milk of the Middle West or something.

23
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:35,249
有力量
Energy...

24
00:04:36,385 --> 00:04:37,818
有雄心
ambition.

25
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:40,115
我希望
I would hope...

26
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:43,090
我的這些能力
that we could direct those qualities...

27
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,126
可以用在有用的地方
to try and retain...

28
00:04:45,194 --> 00:04:47,424
建設新的南方
for the new South...

29
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:51,091
為我們傳統的南方帶來新價值
some of the graceful values of the old South.

30
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:17,949
- 爸爸 - 怎麼了
- Daddy. - What?

31
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,290
- 跟我跳支舞好嗎 - 我跟你跳舞
- Will you dance with me? - Will I dance with you?

32
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,796
如果我跟你跳舞 你答應我什麼
What will you do if I dance with you?

33
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,634
我答應跟你跳舞啊
I'll dance with you.

34
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:33,140
讓媽媽一起來 好嗎

- 晚安 - 晚安 約翰

00:06:17,853 --> 00:06:19,912
鮑勃 再次感謝

00:06:19,988 --> 00:06:23,685
謝謝 鮑勃 晚安 黛比

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,192

00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,825

00:06:28,897 --> 00:06:30,831
晚安 卡爾
Good night, Carl.

41
00:07:57,753 --> 00:08:00,449
媽媽 媽媽
Mommy! Mommy!

42
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:24,638
親愛的
Honey?

43
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:48,000
不准報警 明天準備好五十萬美元
否則別指望你妻女活著回來

44
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,517
打開
Turn it on.

45
00:09:05,053 --> 00:09:06,520
說話 小孩 該死
Come on, kid. Talk, damn it!

46
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:09,216
告訴你爸爸 一定要準備錢
Tell your daddy how much you want him to bring that money!

47
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:12,556
爸爸 請你準備好錢 求求你
Daddy, please bring the money, please!

48
00:09:12,627 --> 00:09:16,688
- 很好 - 求你來救我和媽媽
- That's real good. - Please come get me and Mommy, please!

49
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,996
很好 非常好
That's good. That's real good.

50
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,386
找誰
Yes?

51
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,898
有人送這個東西給考蘭先生
I'm supposed to bring this to Mr. Courtland.

52
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:52,399
進來吧
Come in.

53
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,100
什麼事 孩子
What is it, son?

54
00:10:01,105 --> 00:10:02,480
- 考蘭先生嗎 - 是我
- Mr. Courtland? - Yeah.

55
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,977
送信的人說你會給我小費
The man said you'd give me a tip.

56
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,929
五塊錢 謝謝
Five dollars! Gee, thanks.

57
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,128
- 他長什麼樣 - 誰
- What did he look like? - Who?

58
00:10:28,203 --> 00:10:30,603
讓你送東西的人
The man who gave you the bag.

59
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,105
普通的人
Just a man.

60
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:34,108
你慢慢說 再想想
Let's start at the beginning. Slow down.

61
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:55,000
把五十萬美元裝進手提箱裏
上午十一點搭乘棉花號遊覽船 丟到河邊的老百慕達碼頭

62
00:10:59,968 --> 00:11:01,902
說話 小孩 該死
Come on, kid! Talk, damn it!

63
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,165
告訴你爸爸 一定要把錢準備好
Tell your daddy how much you want him to bring that money!

64
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:07,731
爸爸 請你準備好錢 求求你
Daddy, please bring the money, please!

65
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:12,712
求你來救我和媽媽
Please come get me and Mommy, please!

66
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:14,715
報警
Call the police.

67
00:11:27,762 --> 00:11:30,629
我要把旁切地產的錢撤出來了
I guess I'll have to take my money out of the Pontchartrain project.

68
00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:32,997
我明白 考蘭
I know, Court.

69
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:35,502
這事我也很難受
Just thinkin' about it makes me sick.

70
00:11:37,138 --> 00:11:40,938
我不會趁火打劫
You know, I'm not gonna take advantage of this.

71
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:43,443
我們根據你的計劃繼續開發
We're gonna develop the land just as you planned.

72
00:11:43,511 --> 00:11:46,002
要蓋你想蓋的公園
We'll build your park.

73
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,015
我也喜歡樹
Hell, I like trees.

74
00:11:49,351 --> 00:11:52,752
其實你不必執行我的計劃了
If you pick up the option, you're not obligated to do my plan.

75
00:11:52,821 --> 00:11:56,484
現在你可以按你的想法做 你的選擇很多
You can do anything you want with it. You know that.

76
00:11:56,558 --> 00:11:59,083
我開發這個項目是為了你
I want to do this thing for you.

77
00:12:04,499 --> 00:12:06,592
謝謝 鮑勃 真的很感激
Thanks, Bob. I appreciate that.

78
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:11,205
再說 我們還有一周的時間
Of course, there's still a week on the option.

79
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:14,504
如果警察把你的錢追回來 一切還能回歸原樣
If the police can get your money back, it'll be just like before.

80
00:12:19,581 --> 00:12:21,776
那要去銀行取錢了
Well, I guess somebody oughta get to the bank.

81
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:24,851
我親自去
I'll go there myself.

82
00:12:33,528 --> 00:12:36,793
布裏偵探來了 他想馬上見你
Inspector Brie is here. He'd like to see you right now.

83
00:12:36,865 --> 00:12:39,333
- 請他進來吧 - 好的
- Would you send him in? - Okay.

84
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,733
你好 警官 感謝你登門 請坐吧
Hello, Inspector. Thank you for coming out. Sit down.

85
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,073
謝謝
Thank you.

86
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:52,875
喝杯咖啡嗎
Would you like a cup of coffee?

87
00:12:52,947 --> 00:12:54,881
不用了 謝謝 考蘭先生
No, thank you, Mr. Courtland.

88
00:12:56,785 --> 00:13:01,119
這種事真是折磨人
It's an excruciating situation.

89
00:13:01,189 --> 00:13:03,123
這種感受你更深刻
I guess I don't have to tell you that.

90
00:13:03,191 --> 00:13:07,719
既要做好最壞的打算 但又要抱著希望
Preparing for the worst and hoping for the best.

91
00:13:07,796 --> 00:13:10,856
我見過很多類似的案子
I've seen many cases very similar to this.

92
00:13:10,932 --> 00:13:15,369
最後 人質都能平安回家
They all ended up with the successful return of the hostages...

93
00:13:15,437 --> 00:13:17,803
綁架犯也都被繩之以法
and the apprehension of the kidnappers.

94
00:13:18,873 --> 00:13:23,537
只是要多用腦筋 要夠清醒
It's just a matter of intelligence and calm nerves.

95
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:28,505
希望你盡量配合我們 相信警方 考蘭先生
Just try to leave this as much as possible to us, Mr. Courtland.

96
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:31,575
你能幫上的忙其實不多
There's nothing you can really do.

97
00:13:31,653 --> 00:13:34,622
我願意付錢 錢對我不重要
I'm willing to pay the money. The money isn't important.

98
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,658
這正是關鍵 考蘭先生
That's the hell of it, Mr. Courtland.

99
00:13:37,726 --> 00:13:39,751
這些人都是職業綁匪
These men are professionals.

100
00:13:39,828 --> 00:13:42,592
如果他們拿不到錢 他們便會放棄
If they're caught without the loot, they give up.

101
00:13:42,664 --> 00:13:46,998
如果他們把錢拿到了手 我們的勝算就不高了
If they got the money in hand, we may have a very dangerous fight.

102
00:13:47,068 --> 00:13:48,626
真的嗎
Are you sure?

103
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:50,838
絕對如此
Absolutely.

104
00:13:51,573 --> 00:13:54,974
當然 這最終取決於你
It is, of course, finally your decision.

105
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,274
你會怎麼辦
What would you do?

106
00:14:03,351 --> 00:14:06,043
歡 迎 搭 乘 棉 花 號 游 船

107
00:14:03,351 --> 00:14:06,043
這是我們多次實踐後的結論
Something the lab has developed.

108
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:09,113
我們前往他們指定的地點
We go through the drop as instructed.

109
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,250
把手提箱裏放上假鈔
False money and a small radio transmitter...

110
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:14,488
再佈置一台追蹤器
in a locked briefcase.

111
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:18,054
用無線電追蹤拿錢的人
We track the pickup man by radio truck.

112
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:20,499
他會帶我們找到人質
He leads us to the hostages.

113
00:14:21,136 --> 00:14:22,728
簡單又安全
Foolproof.

114
00:14:22,804 --> 00:14:27,503
你妻子和女兒的生命絕對不會有危險
At no point will the lives of your wife and daughter be in danger.

115
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,509
交給我們辦好了
Just leave it to us.

116
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,524
把預測情報給我
Give me an estimation.

117
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,858
我拿到了 拿到了
I got it, I got it!

118
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:41,180
這下你開心了 小姑娘
You oughta be happy, little girl.

119
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:43,028
你爸爸拿錢給我們了
Your daddy come through with the money.

120
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:46,164
你們馬上就安全了
And everything's gonna be all right.

121
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,902
媽媽 爸爸拿錢來了
Mommy, Mommy! Daddy brought the money!

122
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:17,703
這是什麼玩意
What the hell is that?

123
00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:20,571
追蹤器
Transmitter.

124
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:22,109
混蛋
Son of a bitch!

125
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:27,877
看看 你爸爸覺得你們就像這些白紙一樣
Look at this. This is what your old man thinks you're worth!

126
00:18:27,949 --> 00:18:30,474
- 毫無價值 - 媽媽
- Nothin'! - Mommy!

127
00:18:30,551 --> 00:18:32,542
我是布裏偵探
This is Detective Brie.

128
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,851
我是新奧爾良警局的布裏警官
This is Detective Brie of the New Orleans police force.

129
00:18:35,923 --> 00:18:37,390
你們被包圍了
The house is surrounded.

130
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:41,087
舉起手出來投降 我們就不會開槍
Come out with your hands raised and you will not be harmed.

131
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,323
- 我們怎麼辦 - 冷靜點 去拿刀
- What do we do? - Be calm. Get the knife.

132
00:18:43,398 --> 00:18:45,332
別慌張
Don't panic.

133
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,732
把她們的繩子砍斷 我們走
Cut those ropes and let's get outta here.

134
00:18:47,802 --> 00:18:49,030
把窗戶砸開
Break that window open.

135
00:18:52,106 --> 00:18:54,472
媽媽 媽媽
Mommy! Mommy!

136
00:18:56,611 --> 00:18:59,079
不准開槍 否則這小孩死定了
Don't shoot unless you want the kid to get it!

137
00:18:59,147 --> 00:19:01,411
別開槍 別開槍
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

138
00:19:31,946 --> 00:19:34,141
彼得森 我是布裏
Peterson, this is Brie.

139
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:37,207
我們在羅塞道 接近大橋
We're on the Broussard Road approaching the bridge.

140
00:19:37,285 --> 00:19:39,651
路障就位了嗎
Are your roadblocks in place?

141
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,655
一切就緒 警官
All set on your side, Inspector.

142
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:44,089
我正在疏散一部運油車
I'm helping an oil truck off the road over here.

143
00:19:44,158 --> 00:19:47,992
快把車弄走 我們上橋了
Get it out of there! We're on the bridge now!

144
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:18,324
新奧爾良商人 邁克爾·考蘭的妻子和女兒
The wife and daughter of New Orleans businessman Michael Courtland...

145
00:20:18,392 --> 00:20:20,189
昨天被殺
were killed yesterday...

146
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:23,389
人質拯救行動失敗
when a kidnap-rescue effort sadly backfired.

147
00:20:23,464 --> 00:20:27,161
這位是負責此案的奧古斯特·布裏警探
Over here is Inspector August Brie, who's in charge of this case.

148
00:20:27,235 --> 00:20:30,261
警官 請你描述一下事情的詳細經過
Inspector, can you tell us exactly what happened here?

149
00:20:30,338 --> 00:20:31,600
很報歉
I'm sorry.

150
00:20:31,672 --> 00:20:34,869
現在我不便透露任何信息
I can't divulge any information at this time.

151
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,775
事情實在太悲慘了 無話可說
It's just been too tragic, that's all.

152
00:20:37,845 --> 00:20:40,143
警方已經盡力了
The police did all they could.

153
00:20:40,214 --> 00:20:42,944
屍體打撈始終沒有進展
The search for the bodies remains fruitless...

154
00:20:43,017 --> 00:20:45,212
汽車爆炸十分強烈
hampered by the explosion of the automobile...

155
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:48,050
密西西比河的水流也很湍急
and the currents of the Mississippi.

156
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:16,300
深 切 懷 念
伊麗莎白·考蘭   艾米·考蘭

157
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:10,950
旁 切 紀 念 公 園
新奧爾良 一九七五年

158
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:16,862
這是你們的票
Here are your tickets.

159
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:19,429
記住 你明天十二點半出發
Now, remember, you leave at 12:30 tomorrow.

160
00:23:19,507 --> 00:23:22,874
九點十分到達羅馬 然後換乘快車去佛羅倫薩
You arrive in Rome at 9:10 and you take the Rapido to Florence.

161
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:25,435
- 護照帶了嗎 - 帶了
- Do you have your passport? - Yeah.

162
00:23:25,513 --> 00:23:27,504
我放到你手提箱裏
I'll put these in your briefcase.

163
00:23:27,581 --> 00:23:28,900
- 你準備好了嗎 邁克爾 - 是的
- You about ready, Michael? - Yeah.

164
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,846
我馬上就好
I won't be a second.

165
00:23:30,918 --> 00:23:32,886
那意大利人叫什麼 達努佐
What's that Italian's name, D'Annunzio?

166
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:34,819
他好像有點悶
He's a bit of a bore, I'm afraid.

167
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,519
不過很有錢
A rich one, though.

168
00:23:37,591 --> 00:23:39,525
希望他的英語比我的意大利語強
I hope his English is better than my Italian.

169
00:23:39,593 --> 00:23:43,791
我負責跟他套近乎 他很吃馬屁那一套
You let me take care of him. He's very susceptible to flattery.

170
00:23:43,864 --> 00:23:46,731
我會誇他像凱撒一樣英明 像教皇一樣誠懇
He's gonna love it when I tell him he's as wise as Caesar...

171
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:49,065
他一定樂得屁顛屁顛
and as honest as the pope.

172
00:23:51,172 --> 00:23:53,402
這次旅行一定很開心 鮑勃
You know, I'm gonna like this trip, Bob.

173
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:56,136
真的 我一直充滿期待
Really, I'm lookin' forward to it.

174
00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:00,306
我終於能體會這些年你在佛羅倫薩參加宴會的感受了
I can find out what you were doing on the Florentine junkets all these years.

175
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:04,247
有的吃 有錢賺
Food, money...

176
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:07,310
還有藝術 完美
and above all art, my man.

177
00:24:07,388 --> 00:24:09,356
我是個藝術愛好者
I'm a lover of fine art.

178
00:24:09,423 --> 00:24:13,416
- 這是我唯一的把柄 - 你真是個文藝復興青年
- It's my only vice. - You're just a Renaissance man, Robert.

179
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,127
他說八點
He said 8:00.

180
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:04,469
謝謝 鮑勃 看來你說得對
Oh, thanks, Bob. You know, I think you're right.

181
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:08,815
我早就該來意大利了
I should have come back to Italy years ago.

182
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:11,716
跟你說了 這裏是西方文化的發源地
I told you, old boy. It's the birthplace of western art.

183
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:15,412
有件事我很迷惑
One thing that puzzles me.

184
00:25:15,489 --> 00:25:18,049
這些老頭的老婆怎麼都這麼年輕
How do these old guys get such young wives?

185
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,854
- 我去問問 - 別去
- I'll ask them. - Don't.

186
00:25:29,637 --> 00:25:32,663
你說得沒錯 想看看我老婆的照片嗎
I think so too. Would you like to see a picture of my wife?

187
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,139
你老婆的照片
Picture of your wife?

188
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,676
給他看看照片
Go ahead, show him a picture.

189
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:41,040
用美國人的話說就是 極品辣妹
As Americans say, "Such a jewel."

190
00:25:41,115 --> 00:25:42,639
好女人
Wonderful woman.

191
00:25:42,716 --> 00:25:44,843
還會做飯 極品廚師
And cook... such a cook.

192
00:25:46,353 --> 00:25:47,445
她很可愛
She's lovely.

193
00:25:50,191 --> 00:25:52,659
這是瑪麗亞 極品好女人啊
This is Maria. Such a wonderful woman.

194
00:25:53,394 --> 00:25:55,385
- 給我生了六個孩子 - 很可愛
- And I have six children. - She's lovely.

195
00:25:55,463 --> 00:25:57,158
可愛的女人
Lovely lady.

196
00:25:57,231 --> 00:25:59,165
你的疑惑消除了嗎
Aren't you glad you asked?

197
00:25:59,233 --> 00:26:01,394
不可思議的女人
A fantastico woman.

198
00:26:01,469 --> 00:26:03,835
所以我要賺很多錢
That's why I have to make so much money.

199
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:06,532
她喜歡錢 我也該獎勵她錢
She loves money, and she deserves it.

200
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:08,700
- 人人都愛錢 - 也愛女人
- Everybody likes money. - And women.

201
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:11,176
不是每個人都愛錢 先生
Oh, not everybody likes money, signor.

202
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:15,014
比如我的搭檔 邁克爾
You take my partner here, Michael.

203
00:26:15,082 --> 00:26:17,016
他和我 在新奧爾良郊區
He and I own, in New Orleans...

204
00:26:17,084 --> 00:26:21,350
擁有一片既廣闊又漂亮的地皮
one of the biggest, best plots of land in the suburban city.

205
00:26:21,422 --> 00:26:23,356
買了十五六年了
For 15, 16 years...

206
00:26:23,424 --> 00:26:26,222
他就是不肯在那蓋房子
he has refused to build anything on that land.

207
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,692
就蓋了個墓地
Nothing but a tomb.

208
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:34,780
各位接著玩 時間有點晚了 恕我失陪
If you gentlemen will excuse me, it's a little late.

209
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:38,636
什麼 他居然覺得晚了
Late? He thinks it's late.

210
00:26:38,706 --> 00:26:40,970
我還沒跳舞呢
Hell, I haven't even danced yet.

211
00:26:55,256 --> 00:26:58,316
你昨晚不走就好了 考蘭
You should have stayed with us last night, Court.

212
00:26:58,392 --> 00:27:00,417
年輕時光不多了
We aren't getting any younger.

213
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:02,428
你醒悟啦
Found that out, did you?

214
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,765
你因為昨晚的事生氣嗎
You're not upset about last night, are you?

215
00:27:06,765 --> 00:27:07,280
沒有
No.

216
00:27:09,236 --> 00:27:11,670
那我們今天幹什麼
So what are we gonna do today?

217
00:27:11,739 --> 00:27:15,197
沒想好 不如遊覽一下城裏的風景
I don't know. I thought we might just do a little sightseeing...

218
00:27:15,276 --> 00:27:18,336
多看看藝術品 少喝點酒
absorb a little culture and a little less wine.

219
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:22,046
好計劃
That sounds great.

220
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:33,800
嘿 考蘭
Hey, Court.

221
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:40,432
你和伊麗莎白是在這教堂認識的吧
Isn't this the church where you and Elizabeth met?

222
00:27:40,501 --> 00:27:42,435
我去去就來
I'll be right back.

223
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,660
怎麼樣 考蘭
Well, how was it, Court?

224
00:31:04,138 --> 00:31:05,571
老樣子
The same.

225
00:34:36,883 --> 00:34:41,377
你準備好回美國了嗎 考蘭
Well, you about ready to go back to the old U.S. Of A., Court?

226
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
不
No.

227
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:49,595
我想再多呆幾天
I thought I'd like to stay around a few more days.

228
00:34:49,663 --> 00:34:51,096
是嗎
Oh?

229
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:56,732
我想再回一趟那間教堂
I'd like to go back to that church again.

230
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,067
為什麼想再回去
Why do you wanna do that?

231
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,741
你能陪我一起去嗎
Will you come with me?

232
00:35:04,277 --> 00:35:07,075
沒問題 如果這能讓你心情好點 我樂意奉陪
Well, okay, if it'd make you feel better.

233
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,657
我的天吶
Oh, my God.

234
00:36:04,604 --> 00:36:07,198
- 你一個人呆在這裏真的沒事嗎 - 沒事
- You sure you're gonna be all right, Court? - Yeah, I'll be fine.

235
00:36:07,274 --> 00:36:09,242
- 我還想再呆幾天 - 好吧
- I just need a few days. - All right.

236
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,944
你好好照顧自己
You take real good care of yourself now.

237
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:14,980
謝謝 鮑勃
Thanks, Bob.

238
00:37:10,871 --> 00:37:13,101
沒關係 我會說英語
Oh, that's all right. I speak English.

239
00:37:13,173 --> 00:37:14,401
你是美國人嗎
You are American?

240
00:37:17,144 --> 00:37:18,577
你喜歡聖母圖
You like the Madonna?

241
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:25,274
這是一三二八年畫的
It was painted in 1328...

242
00:37:25,352 --> 00:37:27,183
畫家是柏那多·達迪
by Bernardo Daddi.

243
00:37:27,254 --> 00:37:29,222
是文藝復興早期作品
That's early Renaissance.

244
00:37:31,191 --> 00:37:32,749
- 你是美術學生 - 不是
- You a student? - No.

245
00:37:32,826 --> 00:37:35,590
我以前是個 怎麼說來著
I used to be... what do you call it?

246
00:37:35,662 --> 00:37:37,596
雙語秘書
Bilingual secretary.

247
00:37:39,032 --> 00:37:42,126
後來我聽說這裏重建有困難
Then one day I read about the restoration project...

248
00:37:42,202 --> 00:37:46,502
我就對自己說 桑德拉 聖母需要你
and I said, "Sandra, the Madonna needs you."

249
00:37:46,573 --> 00:37:49,064
於是我辭了那份悶工作就來了
So I quit my dull job, and here I am...

250
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:51,076
開始學藝術史
an art historian.

251
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,375
這份工作很重要
I can't think of anything more important.

252
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:59,585
至少 做這份工作 就算跟人閒聊
Well, at least they don't holler and scream at you...

253
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:02,918
也不會挨上司罵
when you talk to strange men.

254
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,183
你是做什麼的
What do you do?

255
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,788
我是個地產商人
I'm in land development, real estate.

256
00:38:09,863 --> 00:38:12,423
很厲害的工作呢
Ah. Well, that sounds important.

257
00:38:12,576 --> 00:38:13,480
不
No.

258
00:38:15,468 --> 00:38:16,935
一點也不
It's not.

259
00:38:27,614 --> 00:38:28,740
我叫考蘭
My name is Courtland.

260
00:38:30,917 --> 00:38:32,043
邁克爾·考蘭
Michael Courtland.

261
00:38:32,118 --> 00:38:35,451
很高興認識你 我叫桑德拉
Happy to meet you. I'm Sandra.

262
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:36,921
桑德拉·波蒂拉尼
Sandra Portinari.

263
00:38:44,264 --> 00:38:46,926
你做這份工作很久了嗎
You've been doing this work a long time?

264
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,867
我不負責修復
Oh, I'm not doing the restoration.

265
00:38:49,936 --> 00:38:51,870
我只是打雜的
I'm just a workman.

266
00:38:51,938 --> 00:38:54,532
我負責為專家準備材料
But I prepare everything for the specialist.

267
00:38:54,608 --> 00:38:57,805
是這樣的 幾年前
You see, several years ago...

268
00:38:57,878 --> 00:38:59,539
由於發過洪水
long after the floods...

269
00:38:59,613 --> 00:39:03,549
濕氣滲到聖壇壁畫裏面
moisture seeped into a portion of the altarpiece...

270
00:39:03,617 --> 00:39:05,847
然後就開始剝落
and it began to peel...

271
00:39:05,919 --> 00:39:09,320
顯露出下面的舊壁畫
revealing an older painting underneath.

272
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:12,654
然後 藝術專家們開始想辦法
Then the art scholars had to decide what to do.

273
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:17,220
到底是要除掉達迪的名畫
Should they remove and destroy a great painting by Daddi...

274
00:39:17,297 --> 00:39:21,324
揭開下面理藏多年的舊壁畫呢
to uncover what appears to be a crude first draft underneath it?

275
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:25,167
還是修復達迪的壁畫
Or should they restore the original...

276
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:29,140
永遠掩藏下面的壁畫呢
but never know for sure what lies beneath it?

277
00:39:29,209 --> 00:39:31,439
你會怎麼辦
What would you do?

278
00:39:31,511 --> 00:39:33,445
靜心等待
Hold on to it.

279
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:38,012
美是需要保護的
Beauty should be protected.

280
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:41,516
非常好 專家也是這麼決定的
Good. That is what the scholars decided to do.

281
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:46,184
我剛才算是免費給你做了次演講
Now you have a free lecture, and you don't have to read the brochure.

282
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:11,512
我可不可以
I wondered if I might...

283
00:40:12,585 --> 00:40:14,519
請你吃頓晚飯
repay you for your lecture...

284
00:40:14,587 --> 00:40:16,987
就算是為這次演講還情
and ask you to dinner somewhere.

285
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:21,727
你不明白
You don't understand.

286
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,859
在我們這 吃晚飯的意義可大了
Dinner can be a pretty serious affair here.

287
00:40:25,932 --> 00:40:29,663
午飯呢 附近有家餐廳
Lunch. I know a place nearby.

288
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:35,240
先生 我以為通常都是意大利男人追美國女人來著
Signor, I thought it was the Italian men who picked up the American women.

289
00:40:42,415 --> 00:40:45,077
好吧 吃午飯
All right. Lunch.

290
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:48,018
不過我還要再干一個半小時的活
But I have to work another hour and a half before I go.

291
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:50,081
我等你
I'll wait.

292
00:41:11,111 --> 00:41:13,602
你以前來過佛羅倫薩嗎
So you were in Florence before?

293
00:41:14,781 --> 00:41:16,840
很久以前了
A long time ago.

294
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:19,441
戰後 我被分派到這裏
I was stationed near here after the war.

295
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:22,454
當時我還沒出生 不過我媽媽
I wasn't even born, but my mother often told me...

296
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:25,184
經常說起戰爭有多麼悲慘
how hard times were then.

297
00:41:25,258 --> 00:41:27,192
你跟媽媽住在一起
You live with your mother?

298
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:30,991
現在不了 我在維琪奧港租了公寓
Not anymore. I have an apartment near Ponte Vecchio.

299
00:41:31,064 --> 00:41:34,192
媽媽獨自把我撫養成人
But I was raised by my mother.

300
00:41:34,267 --> 00:41:37,065
我父親很早就拋棄了我們
My father deserted us a long time ago.

301
00:41:37,137 --> 00:41:38,570
真悲傷
That's sad.

302
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:43,968
美國佔領期間佛羅倫薩什麼樣
What was Florence like during the Occupation?

303
00:41:45,078 --> 00:41:47,308
很混亂
Confused.

304
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:51,316
這個話題實在不該問我
I'm really not an expert on the Occupation.

305
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:52,749
我當時注意力不在這
My mind is elsewhere.

306
00:41:54,821 --> 00:41:56,812
我在這認識了我妻子
I met my wife there.

307
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,085
話題越來越深刻
Oh, the plot thickens.

308
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:01,821
咱們坐在這訴苦
Let us sit and tell sad tales...

309
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:05,490
一個父親的棄女 一個喪妻的鰓夫
about deserted daughters and lonely husbands.

310
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:08,329
難怪你到教堂的時候
I thought you had a familiar melancholy look...

311
00:42:08,335 --> 00:42:10,080
臉上帶著一種悲傷的情緒
when you came into the church.

312
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,640
其實不是
No. That wasn't...

313
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,640
她去世很久了
She died a long time ago.

314
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,836
抱歉 我並無惡意
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

315
00:42:18,912 --> 00:42:21,506
主要是 我這種單身女子
It's just that a single girl...

316
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:23,845
遇到過很多遊客 多數是美國男人
meets a lot of men, mostly Americans...

317
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:26,408
一個個都想跟我談他們的老婆
who want to tell her about their wives.

318
00:42:26,486 --> 00:42:28,181
我的戒心就比較重
It's not very flattering.

319
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:30,988
她是什麼樣的人
What was she like?

320
00:42:33,093 --> 00:42:34,185
伊麗莎白
Elizabeth...

321
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:39,531
她很像你
She was very much like you.

322
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,863
像我
Like me?

323
00:42:41,935 --> 00:42:43,197
她是意大利人
She was Italian?

324
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:46,204
不是 她長得很像你
No, she looked very much like you.

325
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:49,875
你帶她的照片了嗎
Do you have a picture of her?

326
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,000
沒有
No.

327
00:42:55,515 --> 00:42:57,142
我真得走了
I really have to go now.

328
00:42:58,218 --> 00:43:00,709
改天還能見面嗎
May I see you again sometime?

329
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:02,812
行
Sure.

330
00:43:02,889 --> 00:43:05,483
我們可以吃頓不重要的晚飯
We could have a nonserious dinner.

331
00:43:05,558 --> 00:43:07,583
- 真的 - 什麼時候
- Seriously. - When?

332
00:43:08,661 --> 00:43:10,822
- 今晚 - 今晚
- Tonight. - Tonight?

333
00:43:10,897 --> 00:43:12,831
可以嗎
Is that all right?

334
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,896
那只有五個小時了
That's only five hours from now.

335
00:43:18,972 --> 00:43:20,530
足夠你換衣服了
Plenty of time to change.

336
00:43:21,708 --> 00:43:25,667
好吧 不過我下班後要去醫院看我母親
All right, but I have to go see my mother at the hospital after work.

337
00:43:26,746 --> 00:43:27,940
我去醫院等你
I'll meet you there.

338
00:43:28,681 --> 00:43:30,842
醫院在聖喬萬尼
Oh, it's the San Giovanni.

339
00:43:30,917 --> 00:43:32,350
我知道
I know.

340
00:43:33,453 --> 00:43:34,977
好吧
All right.

341
00:43:35,054 --> 00:43:36,988
拜拜 再見
See you. Ciao.

342
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,919
再見
Ciao.

343
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:49,662
你很喜歡那間餐館 是嗎
You're very fond of that restaurant, aren't you?

344
00:43:49,736 --> 00:43:51,169
是的
Yeah.

345
00:43:52,572 --> 00:43:55,632
你在那裏認識了伊麗莎白
That's where you met Elizabeth.

346
00:43:55,708 --> 00:43:58,768
不是 我們是在你工作的教堂認識的
No, we met in the church where you're working.

347
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:01,439
不過我們常去那裏吃飯
We used to eat in the restaurant though.

348
00:44:04,083 --> 00:44:06,017
跟我講講她吧
Tell me about her.

349
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,554
- 伊麗莎白 - 對
- Elizabeth? - Yes.

350
00:44:11,191 --> 00:44:13,853
我剛才說了 她很像你
Well, as I said before, she's very much like you.

351
00:44:13,927 --> 00:44:16,361
她長得真的很像你
I mean, she looked very much like you.

352
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,555
頭髮是棕色的
She had brown hair...

353
00:44:19,632 --> 00:44:23,033
留得很長 跟你髮型不一樣
and wore it longer, kind of different, you know.

354
00:44:23,102 --> 00:44:25,798
她喜歡擦粉紅色唇膏
And she wore pink lipstick.

355
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:28,238
從來不擦胭脂
And she never wore rouge.

356
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:31,643
她走路
Oh, her walk...

357
00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:36,537
她走路的方式跟你完全不同
Her walk was 180 degrees different than yours.

358
00:44:36,616 --> 00:44:39,050
- 是嗎 - 對
- Different? - Yeah.

359
00:44:39,118 --> 00:44:42,349
- 她走路是典型的布林莫爾式 - 布林莫爾式
- She had a very Bryn Mawr walk. - Bryn Mawr?

360
00:44:42,422 --> 00:44:44,390
對 布林莫爾式
Yeah, very Bryn Mawr.

361
00:44:44,457 --> 00:44:46,391
什麼是布林莫爾式
What do you mean, "Bryn Mawr"?

362
00:44:46,459 --> 00:44:48,654
就是那種 布林莫爾
Bryn Mawr? That's kind of a walk.

363
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:51,458
怎麼說呢
It's... Well, it's...

364
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:56,226
就是 我也不知道
It's... I don't...

365
00:44:56,302 --> 00:44:59,430
你往前走 上台階
Just walk, and I'll... Just go ahead and walk upstairs.

366
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:14,713
不 你這是意大利式
No, that's an Italian walk.

367
00:45:14,787 --> 00:45:16,311
那是當然
What do you expect?

368
00:45:16,389 --> 00:45:19,688
你走路很好看 但不是布林莫爾式
It's a good walk, but it's just not a Bryn Mawr walk.

369
00:45:20,493 --> 00:45:24,224
布林莫爾式 走起路來好像滑步 滑著走
A Bryn Mawr walk is a kind of a glide, you know?

370
00:45:25,164 --> 00:45:28,861
就是那種舊時打扮的女孩 穿著很長的雨衣外套
Those girls used to wear long polo coats in those old days, long raincoats.

371
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:30,960
滑步走 好像上課遲到了一樣
They kind of glide, like they're late for class.

372
00:45:31,037 --> 00:45:33,528
走得太快 像滑行起來一樣
They move fast and just kinda glide.

373
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:36,006
你再試試 滑步 我指導你
This time now, just glide. I'll talk you through it, okay?

374
00:45:36,075 --> 00:45:39,044
- 好吧 - 不要闊步走 滑行
- All right. - Don't sashay so much. Just glide.

375
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:40,340
- 好的 - 去吧
- All right. - Go ahead.

376
00:45:41,714 --> 00:45:43,147
滑步
Just glide.

377
00:45:44,183 --> 00:45:47,250
不是模特步 滑著走
No, not like a model. Just glide.

378
00:45:47,255 --> 00:45:48,900
對 就這樣
That's it. That's it.

379
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:51,000
噢 邁克爾
Oh, Michael.

380
00:45:53,593 --> 00:45:55,527
她喜歡叫我邁克
She called me Mike.

381
00:45:58,598 --> 00:46:00,031
邁克
Mike?

382
00:46:09,876 --> 00:46:13,312
對了 我是個正統的天主教女子
Listen, I am a good Catholic girl.

383
00:46:13,379 --> 00:46:15,006
教皇的話我全都聽
I obey everything the pope says.

384
00:46:15,081 --> 00:46:16,742
明白嗎
You know?

385
00:46:16,816 --> 00:46:18,841
教皇同意我明天見你嗎
What would the pope say if I saw you tomorrow?

386
00:46:19,919 --> 00:46:21,682
我還要上班呢
You forget I have a job to do.

387
00:46:22,522 --> 00:46:24,251
明天晚上
Tomorrow night.

388
00:46:24,324 --> 00:46:27,487
再過兩天吧 好嗎
Let's wait a couple of days, all right?

389
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,028
星期六我放假 我有空
Saturday. I'm free all day Saturday.

390
00:46:31,197 --> 00:46:34,894
- 幾點 - 十一點
- What time? - Oh, 11:00?

391
00:46:34,967 --> 00:46:37,435
我在這等你
I'll be here.

392
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:38,936
好吧
All right.

393
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
拜
Bye.

394
00:46:43,476 --> 00:46:44,909
晚安
Good night.

395
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:13,780
桑德拉
Sandra.

396
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:18,370
再往右一些
Move to your right.

397
00:47:20,847 --> 00:47:23,748
很好 再近一點 近點
All right, come closer now. Come closer.

398
00:47:28,087 --> 00:47:29,418
再近一點
A little closer.

399
00:47:57,417 --> 00:48:00,250
你念的什麼 意大利帥哥給你寫的求愛十四行詩嗎
What is that, a love sonnet from an Italian boyfriend?

400
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,480
不是 你吃醋了
No, it isn't. Jealous.

401
00:48:02,555 --> 00:48:04,648
但丁寫的
That's Dante.

402
00:48:04,724 --> 00:48:06,214
有生之年
"While life endures...

403
00:48:06,292 --> 00:48:10,228
不要對你愛的女子不忠
you should not ever be inconstant to your lady...

404
00:48:10,296 --> 00:48:12,730
寧死不說謊
who in death doth lie.

405
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:17,168
說出我的心聲 我內心的一聲長嘆
So speaks my heart and afterwards doth sigh."

406
00:48:18,304 --> 00:48:21,171
你知道嗎 小時候
You know, as a child...

407
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,174
我經常到教堂來
I used to go to the church...

408
00:48:23,242 --> 00:48:26,473
但丁偷看比阿特麗斯的地方
where Dante came to watch Beatrice.

409
00:48:26,546 --> 00:48:30,983
比阿特麗斯就坐在這裏
Beatrice, la bella donna, would sit here...

410
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:32,984
坐在爸爸旁邊
with her father...

411
00:48:33,052 --> 00:48:34,986
那邊
and there...

412
00:48:35,054 --> 00:48:36,186
你過來
Come here.

413
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:37,900
- 你站這 - 我是爸爸
- Over there. - I'm her father.

414
00:48:37,905 --> 00:48:38,950
- 不是 - 不是嗎
- No. - No?

415
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:43,057
是二十三歲的年輕但丁
The young Dante, 23 years old...

416
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:46,223
站在這裏看著比阿特麗斯
would stand and watch Beatrice.

417
00:48:47,366 --> 00:48:48,799
這裏呢
And here...

418
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:51,831
中間這裏
in between...

419
00:48:51,904 --> 00:48:53,838
坐著伴遊的女子
sat the Lady of the Screen...

420
00:48:54,607 --> 00:48:56,598
但丁假裝喜歡她
a lady Dante pretended to love...

421
00:48:56,676 --> 00:48:59,577
這是為了不讓比阿特麗斯害羞
so that Beatrice would not be embarrassed...

422
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:02,546
被他火熱的凝視羞紅臉
by his continual gaze.

423
00:49:11,557 --> 00:49:14,082
你還愛著伊麗莎白 是嗎
You still love Elizabeth, don't you?

424
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,254
所以你才喜歡我
That's why you want me.

425
00:49:26,138 --> 00:49:27,537
她怎麼死的
How did she die?

426
00:49:33,513 --> 00:49:34,810
我殺了她
I killed her.

427
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:06,976
對不起 我要去醫院了
I'm sorry, but I must go to the hospital right away.

428
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:08,980
- 我母親病得很重 - 我跟你一起去
- My mother's very ill. - I'll go with you.

429
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:11,573
- 不用了 我自己去 - 請讓我去
- It's not your problem. I go alone. - Please.

430
00:50:11,651 --> 00:50:13,983
好吧 我們快點
All right. Well, let's hurry then.

431
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,612
媽媽
Mama.

432
00:50:57,496 --> 00:50:58,827
你靠近一點
Come closer.

433
00:50:59,899 --> 00:51:02,333
我看不清你
I can't see you.

434
00:51:05,605 --> 00:51:08,233
你愛我的桑德拉嗎
You love my Sandra?

435
00:51:08,307 --> 00:51:09,569
噢 媽媽
Oh, Mama.

436
00:51:09,642 --> 00:51:11,576
一定要告訴我
I must know now.

437
00:51:15,681 --> 00:51:18,047
很好
Good.

438
00:51:19,018 --> 00:51:20,144
你愛他嗎
You love him?

439
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,084
我不知道
I don't know.

440
00:51:24,256 --> 00:51:26,019
他要娶你
He marry you.

441
00:51:27,393 --> 00:51:30,851
不好意思 我媽媽就這樣 最愛說媒
You'll have to forgive my mother. She's always been a matchmaker.

442
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:33,257
你有錢嗎
You rich?

443
00:51:37,737 --> 00:51:38,931
你是黑幫嗎
You gangster?

444
00:51:40,576 --> 00:51:41,780
不是
No.

445
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:44,867
嫁給他
You marry him.

446
00:51:44,944 --> 00:51:47,242
媽媽 我倆剛認識
Mama, we hardly know each other.

447
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:50,339
以後有的是時間
You get to know him...

448
00:51:50,416 --> 00:51:52,350
先結婚後戀愛
after you're married.

449
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,800
深 切 懷 念 慈 母
瑪麗亞·弗吉尼亞·波蒂拉尼

450
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:07,953
我也不敢相信 但他就是這麼寫的
No matter how many times I read it, it still says the same thing.

451
00:53:08,027 --> 00:53:10,052
你自己看
Look at that.

452
00:53:10,129 --> 00:53:12,825
幫我定下五月二號 聖路易大教堂
"Hold St. Louis Cathedral for May 2.

453
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:15,833
準備好香檳酒
Break out the champagne.

454
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:19,997
我在十九號星期二回來 並到教堂結婚
I'm returning Tuesday the 19th for a church weddin'.

455
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:22,040
愛你的 邁克爾
Love, Michael."

456
00:53:22,108 --> 00:53:24,042
可憐的考蘭
Poor Court.

457
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:26,408
腦子都糊塗了
He's a goner now.

458
00:53:26,479 --> 00:53:28,640
不過說真的 珍妮
I tell you, Jane.

459
00:53:28,714 --> 00:53:32,343
要不是親眼看見 我也不敢相信
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't have believed it.

460
00:53:33,419 --> 00:53:36,411
那女孩簡直是伊麗莎白轉世
It was like Elizabeth had stepped out of her tomb.

461
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:40,886
過幾天你就能親眼看見了
Yeah, well, you'll see soon enough for yourself.

462
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,428
- 你覺得她是不是圖他的錢 - 我哪知道
- Do you think she's a gold digger? - I don't know what to think.

463
00:53:43,496 --> 00:53:45,760
要不要問問艾爾曼醫生
Maybe we should call Dr. Ellman.

464
00:53:45,831 --> 00:53:48,197
- 問他什麼 - 他一直是考蘭的醫生
- What good would he do? - He's been treating Court for years.

465
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:52,203
但是艾爾曼活在一九七五年
But Ellman lives in 1975.

466
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:54,705
而邁克爾則活在一九五九年
Michael lives in 1959.

467
00:55:42,348 --> 00:55:44,680
- 邁克爾先生 - 朱迪

468
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:46,877
見到你真好
Good to see you too.

469
00:55:46,952 --> 00:55:48,943
這位是桑德拉
I want you to meet Sandra.

470
00:55:50,256 --> 00:55:53,384
桑德拉 這位是朱迪 我們家的永久成員
Sandra, this is Judy, a lifelong member of this house.

471
00:55:53,459 --> 00:55:55,552
你好 桑德拉小姐
Hello, Miss Sandra.

472
00:55:55,628 --> 00:55:57,892
邁克爾先生寫信說起過你
Mr. Michael wrote me about you.

473
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:03,067
- 我來幫你拿 - 謝謝
- Let me help you with this. - Thank you.

474
00:56:35,567 --> 00:56:37,194
房子真漂亮
It's beautiful here.

475
00:57:07,399 --> 00:57:11,199
佛羅倫薩的達努佐先生那單生意 相當有戲
Now, this D'Annunzio-Florence deal is lookin' awful good, Court.

476
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:15,070
那老孤貍總算計劃給咱們投資一大筆錢了
Looks like the old goat is finally gonna invest some big money with us.

477
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,768
現在我要做一些基礎工作
Now, I've got a preliminary breakdown here...

478
00:57:17,843 --> 00:57:20,505
要為工程項目開發 做費用和現金流預估
of the basic estimated development cost and cash flow...

479
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:23,047
還有合併意向書
for the joint venture proposal.

480
00:57:23,115 --> 00:57:25,675
請你親自審一審
I'd like you to look those over if you would.

481
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:28,360
嘿 鮑勃
Hey, Robert.

482
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:32,551
要是我建議你先放一放
You wouldn't file an in personam suit against me...

483
00:57:32,624 --> 00:57:35,491
你不會一氣之下去告我吧
if I asked you to table all this for a while, would ya?

484
00:57:35,561 --> 00:57:38,530
我就要結婚了 好多事要忙 我現在沒那個精力
I mean, with the wedding plans and everything, I'm just not up to it.

485
00:57:38,597 --> 00:57:41,361
- 能不能等等 - 沒問題 考蘭
- Would you mind, for a while? - Can do, Court.

486
00:57:41,433 --> 00:57:43,993
搭檔就是要為你分憂
Can do. That's what a partner's for, I guess.

487
00:57:45,637 --> 00:57:48,435
朋友們都很期待見見桑德拉
Well, our friends are certainly looking forward to meetin' Sandra.

488
00:57:49,041 --> 00:57:51,168
他們都會在大日子見到她
They'll all meet her on the big day.

489
00:57:51,243 --> 00:57:53,939
結婚的大日子
Big day of the big wedding.

490
00:57:54,013 --> 00:57:56,607
我新生活的開始
Big day of my new life.

491
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:59,207
用意大利語怎麼說來著
How do you say in Italian?

492
00:57:59,284 --> 00:58:01,946
我的重生
"La vita nuova."

493
00:58:06,558 --> 00:58:08,253
聽著 考蘭
Look, Court...

494
00:58:08,327 --> 00:58:10,261
我知道這不關我的事
I know this is none of my business...

495
00:58:10,329 --> 00:58:13,492
可是你不覺得有點太快了嗎
but don't you think maybe this is all a little hasty?

496
00:58:13,565 --> 00:58:15,499
有點不成熟
A little premature?

497
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:20,864
你說得對 這不關你的事
You're right. It's none of your business.

498
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:18,780
朱迪
Judy.

499
01:00:19,625 --> 01:00:20,683
什麼事 桑德拉小姐
Yes, Miss Sandra?

500
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:24,921
樓上有個房間鎖住了
There's a locked room upstairs.

501
01:00:24,997 --> 01:00:26,089
是什麼房間
What is it?

502
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:28,697
以前是主人的臥室
It was the master bedroom.

503
01:00:28,767 --> 01:00:30,394
為什麼上鎖
Why is it locked?

504
01:00:32,037 --> 01:00:34,972
我也不知道 桑德拉小姐 我很久沒打掃過它了
I don't know, Miss Sandra. I don't clean it anymore.

505
01:00:36,208 --> 01:00:39,871
我想看看 你能幫我打開嗎
I want to see it. Can you open it for me?

506
01:00:41,747 --> 01:00:44,341
鑰匙不在我這 邁克爾先生拿著
I don't have the key. Mr. Michael keeps it.

507
01:00:44,416 --> 01:00:45,849
在哪裏
Where?

508
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:50,215
告訴你也沒關係 他放在抽屜裏
Well, I guess it's all right. He keeps it in his desk.

509
01:02:02,828 --> 01:02:05,922
一九五二年二月十四日
"February 14, 1952.

510
01:02:07,466 --> 01:02:09,627
佛羅倫薩的日子
I think the days in Florence...

511
01:02:09,701 --> 01:02:13,034
是我一生中最快樂的時光
will be the happiest I will ever have.

512
01:02:13,105 --> 01:02:15,369
新奧爾良很不錯
New Orleans is a nice town...

513
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,034
邁克對我很好
and Mike is very good to me...

514
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:21,102
可是 一切都不同了
but it is all so different now.

515
01:02:21,179 --> 01:02:23,773
他每天都忙著工作
He is busy at work all day...

516
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:29,549
有時候我不禁懷疑 邁克是不是愛生意超過了我
and sometimes I wonder if Mike loves me as much as his business."

517
01:03:45,163 --> 01:03:46,994
就是這 親愛的
There it is, darling.

518
01:03:47,065 --> 01:03:49,465
漂亮嗎
Isn't it beautiful?

519
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:50,626
等到了十九號
And on the 19th...

520
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:53,970
這裏就完全屬於我們
it'll be all ours.

521
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:55,973
好大啊
It's so big.

522
01:03:57,209 --> 01:04:01,737
邁克 兩百位客人太多了吧
And Mike, 200 guests. That's a lot of people.

523
01:04:02,814 --> 01:04:04,941
辦個小小的儀式就行了
Just a small ceremony would be fine.

524
01:04:06,385 --> 01:04:09,013
不行 這不僅是一個儀式
No, it's more than a ceremony.

525
01:04:09,087 --> 01:04:11,146
我要辦成慶典
It's a celebration...

526
01:04:11,223 --> 01:04:13,657
應該有成千上萬人
and there should be thousands...

527
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:16,785
我希望一切都要
and everything's got to be...

528
01:04:16,862 --> 01:04:18,454
非常特別
very special.

529
01:04:21,266 --> 01:04:23,666
好吧 聽你的
Yes. If you say so.

530
01:04:34,613 --> 01:04:35,807
早上好 羅伯特
Good morning, Robert.

531
01:04:35,881 --> 01:04:39,146
- 早上好 邁克爾 - 早上好 珍妮 雪莉
- Good morning, Michael. - Good morning, Jane, Shirley.

532
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:44,900
你好 考蘭
Hello, Court.

533
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,159
你怎麼來了 醫生
What are you doing here, Doc?

534
01:04:50,228 --> 01:04:52,219
我只能這樣才能找到你
This was the only way I had to get in touch with you.

535
01:04:52,297 --> 01:04:55,494
你這個人不好找啊
You're a hard man to get a hold of.

536
01:04:55,567 --> 01:04:57,194
有什麼事嗎
What can I do for you?

537
01:04:57,269 --> 01:05:00,727
我想找你坐坐 聊聊家常
I thought we might just sit down for a while and have a personal talk.

538
01:05:00,806 --> 01:05:02,740
純粹是來看朋友的
Purely a social visit.

539
01:05:04,543 --> 01:05:07,444
你是心理醫生 卻一點都不會撒謊
Why is it psychiatrists are such lousy liars?

540
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:13,500
鮑勃 珍妮
Robert, Jane.

541
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:17,186
你們進來一下 好嗎
Would you come in here, please?

542
01:05:25,864 --> 01:05:28,230
是你們請艾爾曼先生來的嗎
Did you all ask Dr. Ellman up here?

543
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,961
他打電話問你在哪裏
He called to find out how you were.

544
01:05:30,035 --> 01:05:33,562
我們覺得你應該找人談談
We thought you might wanna be talkin' to somebody.

545
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:35,572
好吧 謝謝
That's fine. Thank you.

546
01:05:40,378 --> 01:05:42,369
邁克爾 為什麼你不跟查理談談
Michael, why don't you talk to Charlie?

547
01:05:42,447 --> 01:05:44,711
- 行了 - 這是為了你好
- That's fine. - It's for your own good.

548
01:05:50,922 --> 01:05:55,086
我昨天去府上見了桑德拉 你不會介意吧
I went by and saw Sandra yesterday. I didn't think you'd mind.

549
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,424
你覺得我不會介意
You didn't think I'd mind?

550
01:05:59,064 --> 01:06:01,999
你侵犯了我的隱私 還問我介不介意
You invade my privacy and you ask if I'd mind?

551
01:06:02,067 --> 01:06:05,161
你先聽聽你說的話 好好聽一聽
Will you listen to yourself? Stop and listen to what you're saying.

552
01:06:05,237 --> 01:06:08,638
- 你知道你在幹什麼嗎 - 我很清楚
- Can't you see what you're doing? - I know exactly what I'm doing.

553
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:20,443
我不希望別人侵犯我的私生活
I don't want anybody interfering with my private life.

554
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:24,914
別忘了 我非常瞭解你
You're talking with somebody who already knows you...

555
01:06:24,990 --> 01:06:27,720
可能比所有人都瞭解你
knows you better probably than anybody else.

556
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:34,192
昨天 桑德拉和我談了很多事
Sandra and I talked about a lot of things yesterday.

557
01:06:34,266 --> 01:06:36,757
我覺得你對她不公平
I don't think you're being fair with her.

558
01:06:36,835 --> 01:06:38,894
你不該處於內疚才娶她
You shouldn't marry out of a sense of guilt...

559
01:06:38,970 --> 01:06:43,339
不該由於對伊麗莎白的病態思念而娶她
or out of some morbid preoccupation with Elizabeth.

560
01:06:43,408 --> 01:06:46,377
如今 桑德拉對伊麗莎白揮之不去
And now Sandra is obsessed with the idea of Elizabeth.

561
01:06:46,444 --> 01:06:49,436
她昨天一直在問伊麗莎白的事
That's all she wanted to know about yesterday.

562
01:06:49,514 --> 01:06:52,506
她陷入了你的幻想中 你該清醒一點
She's caught up in your fantasy. You must know what's happening.

563
01:06:53,318 --> 01:06:55,115
給自己一些時間
Give yourself some time.

564
01:06:55,186 --> 01:06:58,644
先跟桑德拉培養一下感情
Let your relationship with Sandra grow first.

565
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:02,557
希望你能繼續治療 即便不請我 請別的醫生也行
And I want you back in therapy. If not with me, with some other doctor.

566
01:07:03,361 --> 01:07:06,353
一定要多給自己一些時間
But give yourself some time.

567
01:07:06,431 --> 01:07:07,363
說得對
Right.

568
01:07:11,503 --> 01:07:13,437
不過你都誤會了
Except you got it wrong.

569
01:07:14,839 --> 01:07:16,773
我吃完午飯
We'll talk about it...

570
01:07:18,109 --> 01:07:19,201
就找她談
after lunch.

571
01:07:19,277 --> 01:07:22,576
那好 你都想開了
Good. We'll work everything out.

572
01:07:22,647 --> 01:07:25,878
有時間到我辦公室來談談
Just come on down to my office and...

573
01:07:25,951 --> 01:07:29,910
我不希望你太衝動 將來後悔
I just don't want you to do anything impulsively that you'll regret.

574
01:07:32,457 --> 01:07:33,890
再見
Bye-bye.

575
01:10:06,611 --> 01:10:08,203
發生什麼事了
What's happening?

576
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:10,180
邁克
Mike?

577
01:10:17,021 --> 01:10:19,785
- 你為什麼在家 - 因為你在家啊
- Why are you home? - Because you're here.

578
01:10:19,858 --> 01:10:21,849
因為我的心在家
Because my heart's here.

579
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:24,087
我再也不想離開家了
Because I never want to leave.

580
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:35,180
喂 考蘭
Hello? Court?

581
01:10:36,241 --> 01:10:38,766
你去哪了 我們好擔心
Where are you? We've been so worried.

582
01:10:40,678 --> 01:10:43,545
這件事我們都很抱歉
Look, we're both really sorry about that.

583
01:10:43,615 --> 01:10:46,140
我們不是故意的 我們以為你
We didn't mean it. We only thought you...

584
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:50,220
好 他在這 你等等
Okay, he's here. Just a minute.

585
01:10:50,288 --> 01:10:52,279
邁克爾
It's Michael.

586
01:10:52,357 --> 01:10:54,416
邁克爾老兄 你在哪
Michael, old boy, where are ya?

587
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:01,164
你不覺得這太
Well, now, don't you think it's...

588
01:11:03,001 --> 01:11:05,196
別這麼急 邁克爾
Now, don't be hasty. Michael.

589
01:11:07,405 --> 01:11:09,771
好吧 既然你這麼堅持
Okay, if that's what you want.

590
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:12,000
考蘭
Court?

591
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:16,572
他想把他在公司的股份轉成信託基金
He wants us to put his share of the company into a trust fund.

592
01:11:16,648 --> 01:11:18,707
- 文件已經寄出來了 - 他在哪
- He's already sent the papers. - Where is he?

593
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:20,375
誰知道
Who knows?

594
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:30,585
- 明天 - 什麼
- Tomorrow. - What?

595
01:11:30,662 --> 01:11:33,290
我們明天結婚吧
Let's get married tomorrow.

596
01:11:33,364 --> 01:11:36,697
我們請太平紳士到這裏為我們主持婚禮
We can have the justice of the peace perform the ceremony right here.

597
01:11:36,768 --> 01:11:39,259
- 為什麼要明天 - 我不想等了
- Why tomorrow? - I don't wanna wait.

598
01:11:41,072 --> 01:11:44,564
不是到聖路易教堂嗎 和你朋友們一起
What about St. Louis Cathedral and all your friends?

599
01:11:44,642 --> 01:11:48,669
那邊可以取消 再說 我根本沒有朋友
We can have it cancelled. Besides, I don't have any friends.

600
01:11:48,746 --> 01:11:51,681
我今天才醒悟 你覺得失望嗎
I found that out today. Would you be disappointed?

601
01:11:53,218 --> 01:11:55,778
不 一點也不
Well, no, not at all.

602
01:12:07,131 --> 01:12:09,793
借由路易斯安那州政府
And now, in accordance with the powers invested in me...

603
01:12:09,868 --> 01:12:12,200
賦予我的權力
by the state of Louisiana...

604
01:12:12,270 --> 01:12:15,535
我宣佈你們結為夫妻
I now pronounce you man and wife.

605
01:13:35,553 --> 01:13:37,487
我等了好久
I've waited so long.

606
01:14:07,452 --> 01:14:08,885
現在
Now...

607
01:14:10,121 --> 01:14:11,748
我是你妻子了
I am your wife.

608
01:14:16,194 --> 01:14:18,219
我是伊麗莎白
I am Elizabeth.

609
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:24,896
為了一個原因 我回來了 邁克
I came back for one reason, Mike.

610
01:14:27,538 --> 01:14:29,369
我回來了
I came...

611
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:32,932
再給你一次機會 證明你的愛
to give you a second chance to prove your love.

612

我回來了 再給你一次機會
I came to give you a second chance.

621
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
桑德拉
Sandra!

622
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:28,360
不准報警 明天準備好五十萬美元
否則別指望你妻女活著回來

623
01:16:30,180 --> 01:16:35,780
把五十萬美元裝進手提箱裏
上午十一點搭乘棉花號遊覽船
丟到河邊的老百慕達碼頭

624
01:17:20,311 --> 01:17:23,303
這麼早打擾你 很抱歉 有急事
I'm sorry to call you so early. Something's come up.

- 別問了 - 你在說什麼
- Don't ask me... - What are you talking about?

627
01:17:29,153 --> 01:17:32,247
- 車上再跟你說 - 要這麼多錢幹什麼
- I'll tell you part in the car. Okay? - What's this money gonna be used for?

628
01:17:32,323 --> 01:17:34,917
什麼名義 我是借貨還是送給你
What's your collateral? Am I loaning, investing or just giving it to you?

629
01:17:34,992 --> 01:17:37,790
這是我的第二次機會 你不明白
It's a second chance for me. You don't understand, but...

630
01:17:37,862 --> 01:17:40,956
- 先進來再說吧 - 不 我不想進去
- Don't you wanna come inside? - No, I don't wanna come inside!

631
01:17:41,032 --> 01:17:43,125
- 你現在很緊張 - 我知道
- You're under incredible strain. - I know I am!

632
01:17:43,201 --> 01:17:46,500
- 找艾爾曼醫生談談 - 去他的吧 快走吧
- You should talk to Dr. Ellman. - The hell with Dr. Ellman! Please hurry.

- 你發瘋我不奉陪 - 隨便
- You can act crazy, I don't have to. - Anything!

641
01:18:07,858 --> 01:18:11,123
我把那塊地買過來 好好保護 公司得靠我照顧
I'll take that land to protect it from you. I gotta look after the company.

642

You're gonna have to sign these papers. Court.

644
01:18:35,386 --> 01:18:36,819
簽這裏
Right there.

645
01:20:37,608 --> 01:20:39,007
考蘭老兄
Old Court.

646
01:20:40,244 --> 01:20:43,407
就是弄不到錢
Just can't come up with the money...

647
01:20:43,481 --> 01:20:45,949
沒給伊麗莎白 也沒給你
not for Elizabeth and not for you.

648
01:21:01,178 --> 01:21:02,480
媽媽
Mommy.

649
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:08,360
媽媽
Mommy.

650
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,480
媽媽 媽媽
Mommy. Mommy.

651
01:21:13,178 --> 01:21:14,780
媽媽
Mommy.

652
01:21:15,012 --> 01:21:17,879
看看 你爸爸覺得你們就像這些白紙一樣
Look at this. This is what your old man thinks you're worth.

653
01:21:17,948 --> 01:21:20,314
毫無價值 毫無價值 毫無價值
Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!

654
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:22,716
媽媽 媽媽
Mommy! Mommy!

655
01:21:22,787 --> 01:21:26,086
把她們的繩子砍斷 我們走 把窗戶砸開
Cut those ropes and let's leave. Break that window open!

656
01:21:39,537 --> 01:21:42,665
不准開槍 否則這小孩死定了
Don't shoot unless you want the kid to get it!

657
01:21:54,852 --> 01:21:58,618
你爸爸覺得你一文不值啊
It looks like your daddy doesn't think you're worth a dime.

658
01:21:58,689 --> 01:22:00,987
你鮑勃叔叔也許願意出點錢
I'm sure your Uncle Bob will.

659
01:22:00,990 --> 01:22:01,990
媽媽
Mommy.

660
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:05,780
媽媽
Mommy.

661
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:09,780
媽媽
Mommy.

662
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:05,000
國 際 機 場

663
01:23:05,489 --> 01:23:07,954
我不要 一分錢也不要
I don't want this. I don't want any part of it.

664
01:23:08,025 --> 01:23:11,392
五十萬美元 很難拒絕啊 親愛的
$50,000 is a lot of money to turn down, darling.

665
01:23:11,462 --> 01:23:14,488
- 你賺的 歸你了 - 本來不該這樣的
- You keep it. You earned it. - It wasn't supposed to be like this.

666
01:23:14,565 --> 01:23:18,194
從一開始你就知道 這是骯髒的勾當
It was a dirty business from the start and you knew it.

667
01:23:18,269 --> 01:23:20,203
跟你說了 考蘭要麼放棄那塊地
I told you Court would either give up the land...

668
01:23:20,271 --> 01:23:22,364
要麼精神失常 沒法經營
or be declared mentally incompetent to manage it.

669
01:23:22,439 --> 01:23:27,206
你同意了的 現在良心發現有什麼用
And you agreed. So don't start getting an attack of conscience now.

670
01:23:27,278 --> 01:23:29,439
至少你幫他振作起來了
At least you kept him out of bed. Look at it that way.

671
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:30,600
你明不明白我犯了多大的錯
Do you realize what I've done?

672
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:32,676
你明不明白我犯了多大的錯
Do you realize what I've done?

673
01:23:34,318 --> 01:23:37,344
我要回去找他 向他坦白一切
I wanna go back to him. I wanna confess everything.

674
01:23:37,421 --> 01:23:39,355
求他原諒我
I wanna beg him to forgive me.

675
01:23:39,423 --> 01:23:42,290
你冷靜點 桑德拉
Look. You hold on. Sandra.

676
01:23:42,359 --> 01:23:44,827
先好好想一想
Just keep your head a minute.

677
01:23:44,895 --> 01:23:48,228
我們剛騙了他幾十萬
We just swindled a man out of millions.

678
01:23:48,299 --> 01:23:50,324
你要是跟邁克爾坦白了
Now, the law isn't exactly gonna look lightly on that...

679
01:23:50,401 --> 01:23:52,631
法律可不會原諒你
if you go back to Michael and confess.

680
01:23:55,072 --> 01:23:58,508
你跟我策劃的圈套天衣無縫
You made a dirty deal with me and you executed it flawlessly.

681
01:23:58,576 --> 01:24:01,511
你是我最成功的一筆投資
You're the best investment I ever made.

682
01:24:01,579 --> 01:24:06,312
你表演的伊麗莎白 把老考蘭騙得神魂顛倒
Old Court fell for your Elizabeth act hook, line and sinker.

683
01:24:06,383 --> 01:24:09,045
享受一下這筆罪惡的財富吧
So now I think you're entitled to the due wages of sin.

684
01:24:09,119 --> 01:24:11,053
你不明白
You don't understand!

685
01:24:15,225 --> 01:24:17,159
我現在怎麼辦
What am I gonna do now?

686
01:24:18,329 --> 01:24:20,797
這種問題有點晚了 親愛的
It's a little late for existential questions, darling.

687
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:23,458
拿著錢走吧 錢能幫你忘掉一切憂愁
You just take the money. Believe you me, it'll help you to forget.

688
01:24:23,534 --> 01:24:25,468
我該怎麼辦
What am I gonna do?

689
01:24:26,570 --> 01:24:27,867
- 我不能拿 - 快走
- I can't take it. - Come on!

690
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:38,043
快走
Look! Move!

691
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:41,308
快點
Hurry up!

692
01:24:44,955 --> 01:24:47,048
你拿到錢了嗎
Have you got the money?

693
01:24:53,497 --> 01:24:55,362
- 這不夠 - 這是給你的
- This isn't enough. - It's all for you.

694
01:24:55,432 --> 01:24:57,161
其他人呢
What about the others?

695
01:24:57,234 --> 01:24:59,828
- 他們都死了 - 天啊
- They're all dead. - Christ!

696
01:25:00,871 --> 01:25:03,431
這次行動本應完美無缺的
Smart business deal this turned out to be.

697
01:25:03,507 --> 01:25:05,907
考蘭真讓人驚訝
Courtland surprised all of us!

698
01:25:05,976 --> 01:25:07,910
拿著錢趕緊走吧
So just take the money and get out of here!

699
01:25:07,978 --> 01:25:09,377
鮑勃叔叔
Uncle Bob.

700
01:25:10,514 --> 01:25:12,004
媽媽在哪裏
Where's Mommy?

701
01:25:17,988 --> 01:25:19,148
她死了 親愛的
She's dead, honey.

702
01:25:21,525 --> 01:25:24,119
你爸爸沒給錢
Your daddy didn't pay the men...

703
01:25:24,194 --> 01:25:26,059
他們殺了她
and they killed her.

704
01:25:26,130 --> 01:25:29,031
你看 我給他們錢了
You see. I gave the man the money.

705
01:25:30,067 --> 01:25:32,365
以後我來照顧你
I'm taking care of you now.

706
01:25:33,671 --> 01:25:35,662
現在 你跟他走
Now, you're gonna go with him...

707
01:25:35,739 --> 01:25:39,539
坐飛機遠走高飛 我有朋友照顧你
on the plane to a faraway place where I've got friends you can live with.

708
01:25:39,610 --> 01:25:43,376
一個禮拜之後我過去看你
Now, I'll be there in about a week to see if everything's okay.

709
01:25:44,715 --> 01:25:45,909
爸爸在哪裏
But where's Daddy?

710
01:25:47,384 --> 01:25:49,784
他不要你了 親愛的
He don't want you anymore, honey.

711
01:25:50,854 --> 01:25:52,116
你跟他走
Now you go with the man.

712
01:25:53,123 --> 01:25:54,613
- 去吧 - 不
- Go on! - No!

713
01:25:54,692 --> 01:25:56,626
- 跟他走 - 鮑勃叔叔 不
- Go with him! - Uncle Bob, no!

714
01:25:56,694 --> 01:25:58,286
跟他走吧
Go with the man!

715
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:01,921
鮑勃叔叔
Uncle Bob!

716
01:26:02,180 --> 01:26:02,960
鮑勃叔叔
Uncle Bob!

717
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,240
鮑勃叔叔
Uncle Bob!

718
01:26:09,180 --> 01:26:10,640
鮑勃叔叔
Uncle Bob!

719
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:13,360
鮑勃叔叔
Uncle Bob!

720
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:15,860
鮑勃叔叔
Uncle Bob!

721
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:19,000
鮑勃叔叔
Uncle Bob!

722
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:53,109
爸爸 我不會請求你的原諒
Father, I do not ask forgiveness.

723
01:26:53,183 --> 01:26:55,947
我知道你無法原諒
I know there can be none.

724
01:26:56,019 --> 01:26:58,817
我沒有跟媽媽一起被殺
I was never killed with Mother.

725
01:26:58,889 --> 01:27:02,086
鮑勃付了贖金 把我送到佛羅倫薩
I was ransomed by La Salle and brought to Florence...

726
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:04,855
跟波蒂拉尼太太住在一起
where I lived with Mrs. Portinari.

727
01:27:04,928 --> 01:27:08,557
他們從小教育我 是你殺了我媽媽
I was raised believing you killed Mother.

728
01:27:08,632 --> 01:27:12,728
我恨你 我生活的唯一目的 是為媽媽報仇
I hated you. I lived for the day when I could revenge her.

729
01:27:13,337 --> 01:27:16,534
然後鮑勃來找我 讓我幫他從你手中騙那塊地
Then La Salle came to me with his plan to swindle the land from you...

730
01:27:16,607 --> 01:27:18,541
我抓住了這個機會
and I got my chance.

731
01:27:27,217 --> 01:27:29,981
但你不像他說的那樣
But you were not like he said.

732
01:27:30,053 --> 01:27:31,987
我從沒想到
I never thought I would...

733
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:34,621
會愛上你
love you.

734
01:28:42,893 --> 01:28:45,760
女士們先生們 很抱歉打擾大家
Ladies and gentlemen, we are sorry to disturb you at this time...

735
01:28:45,829 --> 01:28:48,889
飛機遇到了強烈的氣流
but we have just encountered some unexpected turbulence.

736
01:28:48,966 --> 01:28:52,595
請大家馬上返回座位
Would you please return to your seats immediately and...

737
01:28:58,842 --> 01:28:59,934
請開門
Excuse me.

738
01:29:07,517 --> 01:29:10,611
箱子裏沒有錢
It wasn't there. The money wasn't there.

739
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:11,660
錢不見了
It wasn't there.

740
01:29:11,678 --> 01:29:12,640
考蘭
Court.

741
01:29:13,257 --> 01:29:15,418
你把我叫起床
You got me out of bed...

742
01:29:15,492 --> 01:29:19,326
逼我給了你五十萬美元
forced me to give you $500,000.

743
01:29:19,396 --> 01:29:21,330
當時你簡直發瘋了
You were actin' crazy.

744
01:29:22,799 --> 01:29:25,927
裏面當然沒有錢 我要保護你
Of course the money wasn't there. I had to protect it from you.

745
01:29:28,038 --> 01:29:29,972
真錢在我這
I have the real money.

746
01:29:31,775 --> 01:29:33,436
我是為你好
I was only lookin' after your own good.

747
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:38,113
錢都是你的了
It's all yours now.

748
01:29:38,181 --> 01:29:40,945
我不能看著你把錢扔掉
And this will surely keep you from throwin' it away.

749
01:29:50,527 --> 01:29:52,119
我殺了她
I killed her.

750
01:29:55,299 --> 01:29:58,735
她回來了 給我第二次機會
She came back a second time...

751
01:29:58,802 --> 01:30:01,202
讓我證明我的愛
to let me prove I loved her...

752
01:30:05,742 --> 01:30:07,334
我卻殺了她
and I killed her.

753
01:30:15,485 --> 01:30:16,918
現在她走了
Now she's gone.

754
01:30:19,556 --> 01:30:22,320
你就是留不住女人 是不是
You just can't seem to keep a woman, can you?

755
01:30:24,227 --> 01:30:27,253
你這個自以為是的混蛋
You self-righteous son of a bitch!

756
01:30:28,131 --> 01:30:30,599
你以為你是誰
What did you think you were anyway?

757
01:30:31,668 --> 01:30:33,761
隨心所欲地支配人
Steppin' on anybody you wanted to...

758
01:30:34,738 --> 01:30:38,504
什麼事都要你說了算
tellin' people what to do and when to do it.

759
01:30:39,643 --> 01:30:42,077
你倒坐得安穩
Sittin' on your ass...

760
01:30:42,145 --> 01:30:44,875
那麼多錢從指縫裏溜走
while a fortune slipped through our fingers!

761
01:30:45,949 --> 01:30:48,213
我們本來可以發大財
Do you know how rich we could have been?

762
01:30:51,221 --> 01:30:53,155
你真是不在乎錢啊
But you don't care about money, do ya?

763
01:30:53,223 --> 01:30:54,451
你從來不在乎
You never did.

764
01:30:55,359 --> 01:30:59,318
為了一個撒謊的賤人 今天你又扔了幾十萬美元
You just threw away millions this mornin' for that lyin' little bitch.

765
01:31:06,236 --> 01:31:07,828
殺了我吧
Go ahead and kill me!

766
01:31:09,039 --> 01:31:11,530
連她也要殺
You gonna kill her too?

767
01:31:11,608 --> 01:31:14,577
她跟我是一夥的 傻子
She was in it with me, you fool!

768
01:31:15,712 --> 01:31:17,976
從一開始就是
She was in it from the start.

769
01:31:37,434 --> 01:31:38,958
她回羅馬了
She's goin' to Rome...

770
01:31:43,807 --> 01:31:46,742
拿著你的五十萬美元
with $50,000 of yours.

771
01:31:57,988 --> 01:32:00,718
你不僅扔掉了很多錢
You didn't just throw away a fortune.

772
01:32:03,226 --> 01:32:05,660
也拋棄了你的生活
You just threw away your whole life.

773
01:33:20,704 --> 01:33:23,264
飛往倫敦的七零二號航班
TWA flight 702 to London...

774
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:25,638
預計十點半起飛

Passengers now boarding at gate 16.

776
01:33:31,815 --> 01:33:33,578

777
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:37,108
羅馬 明晚八點
Rome... Tomorrow evening, 8:00 p.m.

778
01:33:37,187 --> 01:33:39,121
你要定票嗎
You wanna make a reservation?

779
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:40,640
對
Yeah.

780
01:33:41,124 --> 01:33:43,957
頭等艙還是商務艙 先生
Would that be first class or coach, sir?

781
01:33:45,262 --> 01:33:46,889
頭等艙
First class.

782
01:33:46,963 --> 01:33:48,294
稍等一下
Excuse me a minute.

783
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:50,900
喂 對
Hello. Yeah.

784
01:33:59,976 --> 01:34:01,409
好的
All right.

785
01:34:02,812 --> 01:34:04,780
先生 你真幸運
Sir, you are in luck.

786
01:34:04,848 --> 01:34:07,715
今晚八點去羅馬的班機返航了
Our 8:00 flight from Rome has just returned...

787
01:34:07,784 --> 01:34:09,718
引擎故障要檢修
to check out an engine malfunction.

788
01:34:09,786 --> 01:34:11,845

790
01:34:18,061 --> 01:34:19,995
我幫你修改一下
If you want me to fix this for you...

791
01:36:36,866 --> 01:36:38,163
爸爸
Daddy!

792
01:36:38,234 --> 01:36:40,395
你帶錢來了
You came with the money!

01:36:40,470 --> 01:36:41,903
爸爸

01:36:49,779 --> 01:36:51,212
艾米

795
01:37:02,292 --> 01:37:03,700
爸爸
Daddy.

796
01:37:03,725 --> 01:37:05,860
爸爸 爸爸
Daddy. Daddy.

797
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:09,780
爸爸 爸爸
