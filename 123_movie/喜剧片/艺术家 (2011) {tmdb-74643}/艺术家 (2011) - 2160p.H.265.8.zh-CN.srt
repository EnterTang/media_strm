126
01:32:22,709 --> 01:32:25,380
嘭！
BANG !

127
01:32:58,862 --> 01:33:04,029
我感觉很糟糕，我只是想帮助你，照顾你…
I feel so bad. I only wanted to help you,
take care of you...

128
01:33:39,650 --> 01:33:42,712
只要你肯让我帮助你，乔治・瓦伦汀
If only you would let me help you,
George Valentin.

129
01:33:47,822 --> 01:33:51,576
这不可能，佩琵
我已经落伍了，没人想听我说话
It's impossible, Peppy.
I'm washed up. No one wants to see me speak.

130
01:33:59,109 --> 01:34:02,139
正是这件事我们可以试试
相信我
There is one thing we could try.
Trust me.

131
01:36:16,869 --> 01:36:18,024
棒极了！
Perfect !

132
01:36:20,029 --> 01:36:21,072
漂亮
Beautiful

133
01:36:21,304 --> 01:36:22,581
你们能再跳一段吗？
Would you give me just one more?

134
01:36:24,252 --> 01:36:25,511
荣幸之至
With pleasure

135
01:37:18,623 --> 01:37:20,461
开拍…
Action...
