{\fscx80\fscy80}利物浦 1760年
Liverpool 1760

4
00:00:45,397 --> 00:00:48,440
{\fscx80\fscy80}人们常说：血浓于水
It is said that blood is thicker than water

5
00:00:48,795 --> 00:00:52,388
{\fscx80\fscy80}血在定义我们，约束我们
It is what defined us, bind us

6
00:00:52,776 --> 00:00:55,565
{\fscx80\fscy80}诅咒我们

7
00:00:55,565 --> 00:00:57,437
{\fscx80\fscy80}来吧，巴纳巴斯
Come on, Barnabas

8
00:01:01,504 --> 00:01:06,589
{\fscx80\fscy80}对一些人来说，探究生命的意义远超过财富和权力
For some learn the mean the life over wealth and privilege

9
00:01:06,589 --> 00:01:10,432
{\fscx80\fscy80}而对其他人来说，这反而只是一种孤独的生活方式
for others a life of solitude

10
00:01:10,434 --> 00:01:14,445
{\fscx80\fscy80}安琪莉科，我告诉你多少次，不要盯着他看
Angelique, how many times do. I tell you not to stare at him

11
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:17,179
{\fscx80\fscy80}记住你的身份！

12
00:01:19,059 --> 00:01:20,657
{\fscx80\fscy80}当我还是个小男孩的时候
When I was but a boy

00:01:20,842 --> 00:01:22,733
{\fscx80\fscy80}父亲带我们来到一个新的世界

To expand the Collins family empire

15
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,590
{\fscx80\fscy80}我们把英国工业发展到了荒芜的缅因州
We brought English industry to the wild maine

16
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:35,498
{\fscx80\fscy80}并在那经营起了美国还未接触过的捕鱼业
and build a fishing business the like of which America had never seen

17
00:01:35,384 --> 00:01:36,382
{\fscx80\fscy80}一年之后
One year later

18
00:01:36,382 --> 00:01:40,032
{\fscx80\fscy80}一个人应该为他所建立的感到自豪
A man should take pride in what he builds

19
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:42,085
{\fscx80\fscy80}但是记住，巴纳巴斯
But remember, Barnabas

20
00:01:42,085 --> 00:01:46,018
{\fscx80\fscy80}家庭才是唯一真正的财富
Family is the only real wealth

21
00:01:49,507 --> 00:01:51,737
{\fscx80\fscy80}随着我们事业的发展
As our business grew

22
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,848
{\fscx80\fscy80}柯林斯港口小镇也繁荣起来
The town of Collins Port grew with it

23
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:58,912
{\fscx80\fscy80}于是我们决定在这扎根
and we decided to put down permanent roots

24
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,165
{\fscx80\fscy80}之后，我们在接下来的15年里不断建设我们心爱的家园
We spent the next 15 years building our beloved home

25
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:13,274
{\fscx80\fscy80}柯林斯伍德庄园
Collins Wood

26
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:21,761
{\fscx80\fscy80}但不是每个人都可以分享我们家族的成功
But not everyone share in our family success

27
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:24,488
{\fscx80\fscy80}爱我吧
love

28
00:02:24,488 --> 00:02:28,639
{\fscx80\fscy80}告诉我说“安格莉科，我爱你，我需要你”
Let me hear you say I love you, Angelique and I want you

29
00:02:34,683 --> 00:02:38,183
{\fscx80\fscy80}安格莉科，抱歉。但是……
Angelique, I am sorry my dear, but..

30
00:02:39,236 --> 00:02:42,198
{\fscx80\fscy80}你这是在让我撒谎
you would be hearing a lie

31
00:02:45,277 --> 00:02:47,952
{\fscx80\fscy80}（咒语）强大起来吧
make the high and mighty

32
00:02:47,951 --> 00:02:52,361
{\fscx80\fscy80}蔑视一切生灵，使他们都臣服于你
Arrogant creatures down you go

33
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,884
{\fscx80\fscy80}这让我的父母在毫无预兆的意外中死去
The links to my parents were no accident

34
00:03:11,884 --> 00:03:16,555
{\fscx80\fscy80}我开始沉迷于黑暗魔法和远古咒语
I became obsessed with dark magic and ancient curses

35
00:03:16,554 --> 00:03:19,975
{\fscx80\fscy80}（咒语）在地狱大门之前注视着
behold upon the gates of hell

36
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:23,779
{\fscx80\fscy80}如果我独自看到字符
If I saw the characters alone

37
00:03:24,429 --> 00:03:28,099
{\fscx80\fscy80}那将是撒旦的真实名字，我会在此祈祷
Blessed upon the satan true name

38
00:03:28,405 --> 00:03:30,157
{\fscx80\fscy80}（撒旦的真实名字）
Myvestvuolas

39
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,904
{\fscx80\fscy80}但在那时，即使我的悲伤逆流成河
But even then in my depth of my grief

40
00:03:36,276 --> 00:03:42,186
{\fscx80\fscy80}黑暗也不是我生命里的全部，我觅到了真爱
not all was darkness,I have found my one true love

41
00:03:42,277 --> 00:03:44,585
{\fscx80\fscy80}你发誓我们会永远在一起
promise me we'd be together forever

42
00:03:44,854 --> 00:03:49,024
{\fscx80\fscy80}好。我以上帝之名发誓，乔赛特。我发誓
God is my witness Josette.I swear it

43
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,064
{\fscx80\fscy80}所有的女仆人都几乎和我有染
Of all the servants I could have sperm

44
00:04:00,064 --> 00:04:02,352
{\fscx80\fscy80}她们的心我可以随意伤害
all the hearts that I could have broken

45
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:05,475
{\fscx80\fscy80}我有了一个秘密
I got the one secret

46
00:04:05,475 --> 00:04:08,583
{\fscx80\fscy80}我和一个女巫有了关系
I got the Witch

47
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:14,071
{\fscx80\fscy80}（施咒）如果他有了新欢，且是真爱，爱让他柔情似水
if he dug another true love to relent his heart

48
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:20,087
{\fscx80\fscy80}那么，我和我的魔法将会把他定格在年轻时期
让他看着他所爱之人
And I and Magic shall dis-might his youth so all he loves will

49
00:04:20,944 --> 00:04:23,326
{\fscx80\fscy80}死去
die

50
00:04:26,415 --> 00:04:28,868
{\fscx80\fscy80}因为被卷入安格莉科的咒语 我心爱的乔赛特
Caught in Angelique spells My beloved Josette

51
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:31,167
{\fscx80\fscy80}被魔法驱使，无能为力的来到海边的悬崖
wanders helplessly to those hill

52
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:35,326
{\fscx80\fscy80}在那里，许多丧失希望的灵魂曾经坠入死亡地狱
where many of the despondent soul have leap to their death

53
00:04:38,851 --> 00:04:40,137
{\fscx80\fscy80}乔赛特！

{\fscx80\fscy80}你都做了些什么？
What have you done?

59
00:06:49,124 --> 00:06:51,975

Angelique had curse me to be a vampire

60
00:06:52,063 --> 00:06:55,730
{\fscx80\fscy80}这样我的痛苦会永无止境的（这里指失去爱人之痛）
so that my suffering would never ends

61
00:07:13,253 --> 00:07:15,624
{\fscx80\fscy80}他是魔鬼！
There is the monster

62
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,737
{\fscx80\fscy80}自此，我和乔赛特生死两隔
Result that I would never belong to her

63
00:07:23,736 --> 00:07:26,044
{\fscx80\fscy80}安格丽科蛊惑镇民让他们敌视我
Angelique turn the towns people against me

64
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:30,516
{\fscx80\fscy80}我被困住让我孤独忍受着悲痛，沉浸在无尽的黑暗之中
And condemned me to suffer my anguish alone in the dark

65
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,751

- 现在几月了? - 十月
- What month is it? - October

230
00:27:26,614 --> 00:27:30,138
- 所以有南瓜 - 什么年份
- Thatˇs why there is pumpkin - What is the year?

231
00:27:30,173 --> 00:27:36,233
1972年，是的
1972,Yeah, 1972

232
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:40,144
1972?

233
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,764
听我说 未来的居住者
Hear me future dweller

234
00:27:44,995 --> 00:27:49,632
你将会是我忠实的仆人直到
you shall be my loyal servant until such time

235
00:27:50,189 --> 00:27:52,911
我释放了你
as I release you

236
00:27:55,948 --> 00:28:00,061
- 你第一个主人是谁？- 你必须净化我
- So, what first master? - You must cleanse me

237
00:28:00,522 --> 00:28:03,861
然后你带我到你所提到的柯林斯庄园
then you will take me to these living collins whom you speak of

238
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:05,959
好吧
Okay

239
00:28:15,563 --> 00:28:19,502
你见过这样的威严？
Have you ever seen such majesty?

240
00:28:19,506 --> 00:28:24,518
谁能够设想欧洲的这份荣耀
How is it a person manage European allegiance

241
00:28:25,043 --> 00:28:27,833
和美国人的企业
and American Enterprise

242
00:28:29,955 --> 00:28:35,218
在这个世界上最好的九个手工设计师知道
nine of the finest craftsmen in the world will ever know

243
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:43,677
巧夺天工，无与伦比
and life the closes of carving glorious masterpiece

244
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:49,247
他们为艺术献出心血
And they all contribute blood sacrifice arts for you

245
00:28:49,826 --> 00:28:55,209
你看这吊灯的错综复杂精致程度
the complexity of this magnificent chandelier

246
00:28:55,714 --> 00:29:00,530
这只有在贵族皇宫里才可以见到
can only be found in the palace of nobility

247
00:29:00,597 --> 00:29:02,391
壁炉
The fireplace

248
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:07,594
大部分都是采用质量上乘的大理石雕刻而成
Sculptured entirely of most exquisite of marbles

249
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:11,185
大理石来自意大利福罗伦达州这座城市
from city, Florence, Italy

250
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:16,757
非常牢固结实
and joined creating more power

251
00:29:22,916 --> 00:29:25,843
你被麻醉了吗？
Are you stoned or something?

252
00:29:26,356 --> 00:29:30,668
亲爱的，他们的确是想把我迷醉，但是这是徒然的
They try stoning me my dear, and did not worked

253
00:29:32,006 --> 00:29:35,458
他们什么时候允许女人在晚上出来了，仆人？
When did they start allowing woman on the night on this day, servant?

254
00:29:36,496 --> 00:29:38,524
卡罗琳
Caroline

255
00:29:38,757 --> 00:29:40,796
- 看 - 额，是
- Look  - Ah yes

256
00:29:41,165 --> 00:29:43,490
不可思议是吗？
Uncanny is it not?

257
00:29:43,617 --> 00:29:46,144
值得我花时间去构想摆姿势
Worth every hour I spent posing

258
00:29:46,147 --> 00:29:51,377
抱歉，我的名字是巴纳巴斯柯林斯
Forgive me, my name is Barnabas Collins

259
00:29:51,417 --> 00:29:54,513
我是 戴维 柯林斯
I'm David Collins

260
00:29:54,858 --> 00:29:59,235
- 我们是？- 亲戚？大概你这么认为
- Are we? - Relatived?, distantly you might say

261
00:29:59,391 --> 00:30:02,649
很高兴认识你，戴维
It was a pleasure to make your acquaintance master David

262
00:30:02,838 --> 00:30:04,900
孩子们
Children

263
00:30:05,015 --> 00:30:07,335
远离那个男人
Get away from that man

264
00:30:07,546 --> 00:30:09,554
他说他是巴纳巴斯柯林斯
He says his name was Barnabas Collins

265
00:30:09,656 --> 00:30:12,578
而且我很确定他觉得我是个妓女
and I'm pretty sure he called me a hooker

266
00:30:12,681 --> 00:30:14,929
这样子就行了，卡罗琳
That will do Caroline

267
00:30:16,955 --> 00:30:19,865
我想跟你谈谈
A word, please

268
00:30:23,283 --> 00:30:27,178
如果这是个玩笑，请考虑一下演奏方式
If this is some kind of a joke,considered it played

269
00:30:28,567 --> 00:30:32,636
如果你是为了继承钱来的，我恐怕你信息很不足
If its money you're after,I'm afraid you been misinformed

270
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,123
但是无论你是谁，你不准再招惹这些孩子
But who ever you are, you are to not look at those children again

271
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:36,997
我说清楚了吗？
Am I clear?

272
00:30:39,676 --> 00:30:43,256
夫人，你把话题转到家庭
Your diversion to family

273
00:30:43,681 --> 00:30:45,908
是可以允许的
is admirable madam

274
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,576
而且你的怀疑
and your suspicions

275
00:30:48,962 --> 00:30:50,988
我也可以理解
understandable

276
00:30:52,368 --> 00:30:58,451
一个陌生的访问者声称自己是你的远房亲属
A stranger arrive, claiming to be a distance relation

277
00:30:59,115 --> 00:31:02,962
问题是你想到的动机很对
question of motive is to be expected

278
00:31:06,096 --> 00:31:08,261
作为科林斯家族一员
As a Collins

279
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:14,573
看来你已经意识到了我们家族曾经历了一段很长时间的黑暗期
surely you are aware of the darkness that have long played in our family

280
00:31:15,148 --> 00:31:18,108
你是指诅咒？
You mean our curse?

281
00:31:18,933 --> 00:31:22,424
关乎鬼魂和吸血鬼的
Which is ghosts and vampires

282
00:31:22,865 --> 00:31:25,262
神话
Myths

283
00:31:26,327 --> 00:31:30,234
这些大概都发生在你之前很多年吧
and like so many before you

284
00:31:30,715 --> 00:31:35,683
自然我觉得你大概是用它们来谋取钱财
I suppose you are to get rid of them for a price of course

285
00:31:36,205 --> 00:31:40,181
我能证明我（跟那些骗子）的不同处
I can prove as I am different

286
00:31:42,185 --> 00:31:47,582
首先，我不是为了钱才以此证明
Firstly, I do not come seeking money rather to provide it

287
00:31:48,189 --> 00:31:50,148
其次
Secondly,

288
00:31:50,468 --> 00:31:55,272
我像了解我自己一样了解这座房子里面的
I know the of this mansion as well as my own

289
00:31:55,645 --> 00:31:59,508
的每一个隐蔽处，每一个角落
Every nook, every corner

290
00:32:00,104 --> 00:32:02,614
每一个秘密
Every secret

291
00:32:07,777 --> 00:32:10,206
它们都保存着我的东西
There's where I keep my things

292
00:32:11,819 --> 00:32:14,353
真是可耻的滥用啊
A disgraceful misuse

293
00:32:15,297 --> 00:32:17,193
印象深刻
Impressive

294
00:32:18,857 --> 00:32:22,575
但是老房子里面都大部分隐藏暗门
but there are plenty of old houses with hidden doors

295
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:26,421
我希望你有其三
I hope you have a Thirdly

296
00:32:26,714 --> 00:32:29,384
事实上，告诉我
Indeed, tell me

297
00:32:30,091 --> 00:32:32,191
你都知道些什么
What do you know

298
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:37,088
-关于巴纳巴斯柯林斯 - 他是个传奇人物
-of Barnabas Collins - Just legends really

299
00:32:38,075 --> 00:32:40,927
他很自信，强壮
He was confident and strong

300
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:43,374
受人尊重
Admires by all

301
00:32:43,566 --> 00:32:46,641
但是他觉得他父母的死亡跟家族受到诅咒
but he believe our family was cursed and

302
00:32:46,813 --> 00:32:49,940
有关系之后，他就疯了
when his parents were killed, he went mad

303
00:32:49,944 --> 00:32:54,548
始终坚持沉迷下去，最终被女巫变成了一个吸血鬼
went around insisting that witch had turned him into a vampire

304
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,324
你关于他的死知道些什么
What is known of his death?

305
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,329
傻帽都不知道
Nothing

306
00:33:00,871 --> 00:33:04,536
-这个我无从知道- 那就对了，夫人
-Not that I can think of  - Thatˇs madam

307
00:33:05,103 --> 00:33:08,032
因为他根本不会死
is because he never died

308
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:29,405
我就是巴纳巴斯柯林斯
I am Barnabas Collins

309
00:33:35,361 --> 00:33:38,749
-那意味着你是……-吸血鬼，夫人
- That means your - A vampire, Madam

310
00:33:38,788 --> 00:33:40,754
是的
Yes

311
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:43,701
非常痛恨
and most regrettably so

312
00:33:45,946 --> 00:33:49,951
但是很重要的是我是科林斯家园的人
but more importantly I am a Collins

313
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:52,371
我将给予你承诺
And I give you a word of honor

314
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:57,190
不只是你，这个房子里所有的人都不用担心
rather you or many or any under this roof need fear

315
00:33:57,195 --> 00:34:00,004
我的诅咒
my cursed nature

316
00:34:17,434 --> 00:34:23,104
我父亲在这个房间里设置了很多的密室
My father had a quite of flare of secret passages and rooms

317
00:34:24,447 --> 00:34:26,135
小时候
as a boy

318
00:34:26,137 --> 00:34:29,581
我就兴冲冲的去发掘每一个密室
I took it upon myself to discover each one

319
00:34:29,585 --> 00:34:34,812
这个密室是我最喜欢的
but this one, this one was always my favourite

320
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:41,334
家庭是这个世界上最真实的财富
Family is the only real wealth that worth a lot

321
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,726
即使他说得很清楚
though clearly

322
00:34:44,926 --> 00:34:49,450
但他却没有反对另一种
he did not oppose to other kind

323
00:34:49,792 --> 00:34:51,813
天哪
Oh my God

324
00:34:52,597 --> 00:34:56,922
我们竟然这些年一直住在一个宝藏室的上面
We been sitting on top of a fortune all these years

325
00:35:00,115 --> 00:35:02,022
知道这个
know this

326
00:35:02,315 --> 00:35:05,059
我的意思是说
I mean to stay

327
00:35:06,068 --> 00:35:09,610
我也是这个家庭的一份子这也将重新是家庭的一部分
I mean to be a part of this family again

328
00:35:09,614 --> 00:35:12,929
-不过有个条件  -说
- On one condition  - Yes

329
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:15,514
对我承诺
Promise me that this

330
00:35:15,703 --> 00:35:19,712
这些将是我们之间的秘密
All of this will remain our secret

331
00:35:20,581 --> 00:35:23,075
好
So be it

332
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:26,656
伙伴
Partners

333
00:35:32,426 --> 00:35:36,203
欢迎回到巴纳巴斯家园
Welcome home Barnabas Collins

334
00:35:39,807 --> 00:35:45,495
我被有着铁牙的龙给弄醒了
I was awaken by yellow dragon with iron teeth

335
00:35:46,108 --> 00:35:51,620
面对着大大小小发光的数千盏花灯
confronted by giant little luminescent of a thousand lanterns

336
00:35:52,105 --> 00:35:55,147
他将一直和我们一起住下去吗
He just stay with us forever is he?

337
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,134
我喜欢他
I like him

338
00:35:57,136 --> 00:36:01,300
是啊，我觉得什么事情在英国都不一样吧
Yes, I'm sure things are different in England

339
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,276
那么，巴纳巴斯，你家是经营什么产业
So, Barnabas, what sort of business you in back home?

340
00:36:06,349 --> 00:36:10,609
柯林斯家族有着强大的产业
The Collins family has always been efficient business

341
00:36:10,761 --> 00:36:14,388
但是两个世纪后，我已经决定
but after two centuries of considerations, I have decided

342
00:36:14,392 --> 00:36:17,920
我将将全部心血花在
to devote my entire eternity to 

343
00:36:18,771 --> 00:36:23,711
-家庭上 -他意思是看起来像两个世纪过去了
-family - He mean it seem like 2 centuries

344
00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:29,006
早上好
Good Morning

345
00:36:32,427 --> 00:36:34,514
你是谁
Who the hell is this?

346
00:36:34,516 --> 00:36:38,530
霍夫曼医生，这是我们的远房亲戚
Dr. Hoffman, this is our distance relative

347
00:36:38,535 --> 00:36:42,460
巴纳巴斯柯林斯，巴纳巴斯家族第三代
Barnabas Collins, the third

348
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,632

Barnabas Collins, the third is going to stay with us from England

349
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,111
巴纳巴斯
Barnabas

350
00:36:48,113 --> 00:36:50,486
朱莉霍夫曼医生
Doctor Julia Hoffman

351
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,079
天哪
My God

352
00:36:53,081 --> 00:36:55,818
竟然是一个女的医生
A woman doctor

353
00:36:55,855 --> 00:36:58,798
这个世道怎么了
What an age this is

354
00:36:59,698 --> 00:37:02,350
他是认真的吗？
Is he for real?

355
00:37:02,641 --> 00:37:05,349
他仅仅是因为长途劳顿导致太过疲惫
He's just tired from his long trip

356
00:37:05,633 --> 00:37:10,735
我看你已经费尽心机让这些家族银器发出光来
I see you have grown desperate enough to give off the family silverware

357
00:37:10,774 --> 00:37:13,221
你怎么能说这些都是复制品
How can you tell, these are the exact replicas

358
00:37:13,258 --> 00:37:16,755
如果这些是真正的银，我的手
Had this fork being real silver, my hand would

359
00:37:16,759 --> 00:37:20,572
只要轻轻一碰就会燃烧起来
have burst into flame upon the slightest touch

360
00:37:22,857 --> 00:37:27,137
对了，你说过，你有个糟糕的金属过敏症
Yes, you mentioned, you have a terrible metal allergies

361
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:32,302
无论如何，渔业生意都没有了
anyway, the fishing business had all but gone

362
00:37:32,456 --> 00:37:34,695
那些传统都要快消失了
the manner is nearly in ruins

363
00:37:34,897 --> 00:37:38,469
我就已经回来了，同时你们也会尽快的
Well I have returned and in short order

364
00:37:38,705 --> 00:37:41,457
重振我们的财富

你为什么不让他们叫你维琪

375
00:38:26,911 --> 00:38:30,040
像维多利亚的名字是多么好听
A name like Victoria is so beautiful

376
00:38:30,044 --> 00:38:33,848
我已经不能分辨出他们的每一个美妙的单音了

嗨，对了

Money might grow money on trees where you're from

379
00:38:40,096 --> 00:38:42,829

400
00:40:01,291 --> 00:40:04,789
9号线在哪里？

My, we let this place go to hell haven't we?

410
00:41:07,783 --> 00:41:10,987

我真的很想再和你私下说说话

429
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:30,857
你怎么敢用我卑劣的手段对我？

真正的你

你怎么敢用你的邪恶的嘴唇亲吻我
How dared you place your wicked lips upon me

432
00:42:50,155 --> 00:42:53,595
我记得这个地方过去不那么令人沮丧
I remember this place being less depressing

433
00:42:55,561 --> 00:42:58,898
还记得这工具带来很大乐趣
And also remember the tools having a lot of fun

434
00:42:59,787 --> 00:43:02,067
这里

435
00:43:03,086 --> 00:43:05,115
还有

这里

437

你知道你让我受尽折磨吗？
Have you any idea what you put me through?

438
00:43:12,228 --> 00:43:16,639
你杀光了我爱的人，还把我诅咒变成了可怕的生物
You killed all my lover and curse to be this hideous creature

439
00:43:16,643 --> 00:43:18,323
巴纳巴斯 忘记那些事吧
Barnabas get over it

440
00:43:18,324 --> 00:43:21,165
200年来，我一直苟活在棺木里
I lived in a box for 200 years

441
00:43:21,168 --> 00:43:25,459
不要夸大事实 只有196年
Don't exaggerate its only a 196

442
00:43:25,518 --> 00:43:28,170
课我就像度过了永恒一样

443

444
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:36,723
可怜的巴纳巴斯

当你小睡的时候，所有的东西已经变了
Thing have changed while you were taking your nap

446
00:43:41,446 --> 00:43:45,597
现在的科林斯港口变成了我的天使湾
My Angel Bay is Collins Port now

447
00:43:45,618 --> 00:43:49,746
所以是你把柯林斯家族的产业推向了深渊
So are the one who sent the Collins family business into the abyss

448
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:52,617

449
00:43:52,618 --> 00:43:55,089
山中无老虎猴子称大王
I'm the only big fish left in the pond

450
00:43:55,202 --> 00:43:57,052
真的是这样吗？
Is that so?

451
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:00,201
只有善良的柯林斯港人知道
only the good people of Collins Port knows

452
00:44:00,202 --> 00:44:04,195
他们心爱的安琪只不过是卑贱的恶魔
that their beloved Angie is a whore of Beelzebub

453
00:44:04,681 --> 00:44:08,296
你真的认为所有人会相信你说的话吗？
Do you really think anyone would believe a word you said?

454
00:44:08,299 --> 00:44:11,945
这个小镇还会有人支持你200年吗？
having enough standing member of this community for 200 years

455
00:44:13,085 --> 00:44:14,588
一个接一个
in one port to another

456
00:44:14,782 --> 00:44:17,836
虽然你的名字改变了，但你仍然是
Your name may have changed but you remained

457
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:19,961
一个恶魔
a Satan

458
00:44:20,167 --> 00:44:22,621
一个卑贱的恶魔
a devil hooker

459
00:44:25,903 --> 00:44:28,967
现在柯林斯港的人都崇拜信徒了 （信春哥了）
The people of Collins Port admires worshipers now

460
00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:33,676
对他们来说，你只不过是个连阳光都不敢直视的陌生人
and to them you just a stranger whose afraid of the sun

461
00:44:36,443 --> 00:44:40,559
欢迎回到黑暗深渊，巴纳巴斯 柯林斯
Welcome back to the shadow ，Barnabas Collins

462
00:44:41,165 --> 00:44:43,310
我想念你
I miss you

463
00:44:52,945 --> 00:44:55,150
天使湾
Angel Bay

464
00:44:55,152 --> 00:44:59,378
真是一个令人作呕的名字
the only dusty name summons vomits

465
00:44:59,539 --> 00:45:03,827
我一直都知道关于安琪的事，除了她是女巫的事实
I always knew there were something off about Angie, but a witch?

466
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:06,185
真的
Indeed

467
00:45:06,186 --> 00:45:09,941
一个非常怨恨我的女巫
A witch with an impenetrable hatred of me

468
00:45:10,265 --> 00:45:14,978
怨恨？不是，如果她只是讨厌你，她早就应该杀了你
Hate? No, if she merely hated you,she would've killed you

469
00:45:15,352 --> 00:45:17,330
诅咒是需要祭品的
A curse takes devotion

470
00:45:18,588 --> 00:45:20,373
为什么我必须孤独？
Why must I alone

471
00:45:20,375 --> 00:45:24,779
忍受着这个害群之马？
bear the rotten fruit on our cursed family tree?

472
00:45:25,387 --> 00:45:28,657
我的父母被夺走了
My parents were taken

473
00:45:31,816 --> 00:45:34,149
我的真爱
My true love

474
00:45:34,306 --> 00:45:36,020
夺走了
taken

475
00:45:36,307 --> 00:45:38,717
那你做了什么
and what did you do?

476
00:45:40,515 --> 00:45:43,774
我尝试去跳悬崖
I attempt to throw myself off a cliff

477
00:45:43,812 --> 00:45:46,435
悲催的是我跳了
tragically I did

478
00:45:46,664 --> 00:45:48,622
然后
and then

479
00:45:48,986 --> 00:45:51,443
我变成了一个吸血鬼
I became a vampire

480
00:45:52,036 --> 00:45:56,373
开始杀害无辜的城镇的人们
Started to kill innocent Towns people

481
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:02,101
没错
Yes

482
00:46:02,531 --> 00:46:06,035
但你也让家族得以延续下去
but you also kept the family afloat

483
00:46:06,302 --> 00:46:09,614
努力使风俗不被瓦解
and try to keep the manner from falling apart

484
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:11,851
对
Yes

485
00:46:13,221 --> 00:46:17,416
是的，我确实做了，不是吗？  -你一直在战斗，巴纳巴斯
- Yes, I did didn't I?  - You fought on Barnabas

486
00:46:18,607 --> 00:46:23,507
以你自己疯狂而痛苦的方式在战斗着
In your own crazy and miserable way, you fought on

487
00:46:23,845 --> 00:46:27,484
知道他们不得不把你拖走兵锁在一个棺木里
until they had to drag you away and lock you in an iron box

488
00:46:27,489 --> 00:46:30,464
- 为了让你停止反抗 -天哪，你是对的
- to keep you from fighting  - My god, you're right

489
00:46:30,468 --> 00:46:33,637
你在战斗，是因为战斗已经融入了你的血液里
You fought on because it's in you blood,

490
00:46:33,742 --> 00:46:35,260
是我们的血液  夫人
In our blood Madam

491
00:46:35,262 --> 00:46:38,859
现在你有机会再战
and now you had the chance to fight again

492
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:43,261
我会去战斗
and fight I shall

00:50:16,027 --> 00:50:20,136
Clarena船长我希望你能见见巴纳巴斯 柯林斯
Captain Clarena I like you to meet Barnabas Collins

501
00:50:21,596 --> 00:50:23,203
柯林斯？
Collins?

502
00:50:24,518 --> 00:50:28,836
柯林斯家人有什么要跟我谈的吗？
and why does Collins want to talk to me?

503
00:50:34,747 --> 00:50:38,678
想要和你签一个合同 - 我有合同了
- To offer you a contract   - I have a contract

504
00:50:39,393 --> 00:50:41,317
和天使湾的
with Angel Bay

505
00:50:41,491 --> 00:50:43,917
如果我告诉你 我可以给你更好的待遇
and if I told you I could offer you a better one

506
00:50:44,067 --> 00:50:46,512
柯林斯先生，我可以告诉你的
Then Mr Collins I would tell you

507
00:50:46,515 --> 00:50:50,012
此恨绵绵无绝期 (永远不可能的意思)
to take a long walk of a short tear

508
00:50:50,052 --> 00:50:55,602
这就是我这一行的忠诚
There are such a thing as loyalty in our line of work

509
00:50:56,206 --> 00:50:58,219
我明白
I see

510
00:51:00,149 --> 00:51:02,716
Clarena先生
Mr Clarena

511
00:51:04,949 --> 00:51:08,715
对于天使湾的工资你已经感到相当疲惫了
You have grown rather weary working for Angel Bay

512
00:51:09,152 --> 00:51:12,847
事实上 你宁愿将你的灵魂出卖给撒旦
In fact you would rather sell your soul to Satan

513
00:51:14,447 --> 00:51:19,175
也不会出售更多的鱼给天使湾，你懂了吗
then sell more fish for Angel Bouchard, do you understand?

514
00:51:20,103 --> 00:51:25,992
-我懂了  -非常好
- I understand  - Very Good

515
00:51:26,596 --> 00:51:28,630
现在
Now

516
00:51:28,808 --> 00:51:33,817
我希望你能给我介绍一下附近的船长
Would you be so kind as to introduce me to some of your fellow captains

517
00:52:36,209 --> 00:52:40,143
巴纳巴斯，你为什么要盯着卡洛琳的房间？
Barnabas, why are you staring into Caroline's room?

518
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:42,973
那是什么东西？
What is that thing?

519
00:52:43,537 --> 00:52:48,554
-那是台灯  -看起来像血液
- Its a Lamp  - Look like blood

520
00:52:49,229 --> 00:52:52,485
我认为是时候给你看下我的实验室了，巴纳巴斯
I think its time I show you my office, Barnabas

521
00:52:52,512 --> 00:52:54,307
你知道精神科医生是什么吗？
You know what a psychiatrist is?

522
00:52:54,311 --> 00:52:56,816
令人遗憾的是这个词本身对我很陌生
Regrettably the word is foreign to me

523
00:52:56,956 --> 00:53:01,216
我也许可以猜测它是一些美国佳肴
may I assume it's some species of American delicacy

524
00:53:01,674 --> 00:53:05,676
我是医学博士，专攻于心理的
Its a medical doctor that specializes in the mind

525
00:53:05,716 --> 00:53:07,986
我是精神病专家
I'm a psychiatrist

526
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:12,544
现在
now

527
00:53:12,546 --> 00:53:15,712
-你是哪里出生的？ -利物浦
- Where were you born?    - Liverpool

528
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:19,134
-你能描述一下那里吗？  -那里是肮脏的
- Can you describe it to me? - It's filthy

529
00:53:19,173 --> 00:53:23,897
街上散发着泥土的味道
The street reeks smells of dirt

530
00:53:23,903 --> 00:53:27,978
排泄物的味道充斥在空气中
smell of urine permits the air

531
00:53:28,699 --> 00:53:31,640
你有催眠的经验吗？ 巴纳巴斯
Have you any experience with hypnosis Barnabas?

532
00:53:31,644 --> 00:53:36,095
-我发现它很有用，对吗？ -没错，我同意
- I find it very useful, yes? - Yes, I agree

533
00:53:37,114 --> 00:53:39,173
你想下
You see

534
00:53:39,384 --> 00:53:43,938
有时候我们制造一个幻想世界
sometimes we make up a fantasy world

535
00:53:43,944 --> 00:53:47,459
帮助我们消除过去可怕的记忆
to help us erase horrible memories of our pass

536
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:51,625
我发现催眠贯穿其中
I found Hypnotism cuts through all that

537
00:53:52,535 --> 00:53:55,834
我发现它还可以用于其他目的
I found it for other purposes

538
00:53:56,201 --> 00:53:59,113
我可以催眠你吗，巴纳巴斯？
May I hypnotize you, Barnabas?

539
00:53:59,256 --> 00:54:00,748
夫人
Madam

540
00:54:01,031 --> 00:54:04,755
我不相信会有一丁点的可能性
I do not believe  thatˇs remotely possible

541
00:54:06,889 --> 00:54:08,797
好的
Good

542
00:54:11,888 --> 00:54:13,826
现在
now

543
00:54:13,829 --> 00:54:16,738
我想你告诉我一些事情
I like you to tell me a few things

544
00:54:21,067 --> 00:54:23,080
一个吸血鬼
A vampire?

545
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,480
小声点
Keep your voice down

546
00:54:24,748 --> 00:54:27,748
你究竟在说什么？
What on earth are you talking about?

547
00:54:27,752 --> 00:54:31,176
哦，宽恕我，我只是催眠了他几个小时
Oh spare me, I had him under hypnosis for hours

548
00:54:31,181 --> 00:54:32,405
巴纳巴斯？
Barnabas?

549
00:54:33,406 --> 00:54:36,596
但他一直在帮我补全那些原本只是幻想的谬误
There is a point where all illusions fails but he's been bodge

550
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,886
他告诉我一切
He told me everything

551
00:54:37,888 --> 00:54:41,021
奥克自从他回来时你所指的他的秘密
Including the fact that you known his secret since he arrived

552
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,838
你为什么一点也不说出来？
Why the hell didn't you say anything?

553
00:54:42,841 --> 00:54:44,207
我想保护孩子
I was protecting the children

554
00:54:44,209 --> 00:54:47,363
通过包藏一个吸血鬼？
By hiding a vampire in one of the guest bedroom?

555
00:54:48,367 --> 00:54:50,440
你知道他已经承认在一个建筑工地杀了人
Do you know he admitted killing the men at a construction site,

556
00:54:50,444 --> 00:54:51,276
他是凶手
he's a murderer

557
00:54:51,277 --> 00:54:53,341
他是科林斯，一个好人
He's a Collins and a good man and

558
00:54:53,343 --> 00:54:56,012
而且这些天来，这也只是一个巧合
these days, that's a desperately rare combination

559
00:54:56,014 --> 00:54:59,267
哦，我差点忘了，科林斯家族是不会做错什么的
Oh yes, I almost forgot, the family that can do no wrong

560
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:02,100
你知道吗？茱莉娅，对你 我感到非常惊奇
You know Julia I'm surprised at you

561
00:55:02,103 --> 00:55:07,177
我想作为你这一个专家，你会对他感兴趣的
I think a physician like you would find him fascinating

562
00:55:08,119 --> 00:55:11,963
当然啊，在医学上，心理上
Well sure, medically, psychologically

563
00:55:12,288 --> 00:55:15,076
肉体上他都是迷人的
physically he's fascinating

564
00:55:15,191 --> 00:55:18,306
这就是为什么我来找你而不是警察
Which is exactly why I came to you instead of the police

565
00:55:18,309 --> 00:55:20,587
如果他真的很迷人 朱莉娅
If fascinated Julia

566
00:55:20,625 --> 00:55:24,582
如果你对这个家族还有一丁点爱和尊敬
if you have an atom love and respect for this family

567
00:55:24,976 --> 00:55:27,268
就把你的嘴闭上
keep your mouth shut

568
00:55:29,747 --> 00:55:32,316
与您讨论这个问题我感到不舒服
I'm don't feel comfortable discussing this with you

569
00:55:32,374 --> 00:55:35,904
不用担心，我的孩子。我只是寻求一些建议
Do not fear my child，I simply seeking advice

570
00:55:35,908 --> 00:55:39,103
这次只是关于女人方面的
only according  the woman of this time

571
00:55:39,267 --> 00:55:44,559
有那个女人比你这个年纪更好呢？
and whom better choose than a woman of your age

572
00:55:44,931 --> 00:55:47,084
你年纪多大了，如果可以告诉我的话
What is your age, if I may?

573
00:55:47,086 --> 00:55:50,248
-15岁 - 15岁还没有丈夫？
- Fifteen - 15 and no husband?

574
00:55:50,287 --> 00:55:53,403
你必须把那些胸部和臀部秀出来
You must put those bosom hips to use at once

575
00:55:53,407 --> 00:55:56,521
除非你的女人气质消散或者已经凋零了
unless your womanhood will swollen up and die

576
00:55:56,802 --> 00:55:58,563
你很奇怪
you're weird

577
00:55:58,565 --> 00:56:03,829
你认为我奇怪是因为对于女人的态度太过生硬直接了吗
What do you think me too weird of a woman of this blunt

578
00:56:04,834 --> 00:56:07,993
你显然是指维琪
You obviously mean Vicky

579
00:56:08,722 --> 00:56:14,322
她是我看过的最丰满胸部和臀部的女人
She has the most fertile bosom hips I ever laid eyes upon

580
00:56:14,787 --> 00:56:18,555
你太古怪了，你是这样想的么？
- You're way too weird      - Do you really think so?

581
00:56:19,048 --> 00:56:23,107
你二逼，落伍，老套
You're stiff, proper, old fashion

582
00:56:23,592 --> 00:56:25,687
维多利亚呢？
and Victoria?

583
00:56:26,035 --> 00:56:29,430
她不是很正派吗？
Is she not proper?

584
00:56:29,468 --> 00:56:32,947
其实她喜欢假装自己是摇滚乐手
She like to pretend she's rock and roll,

585
00:56:32,951 --> 00:56:35,920
她肯定是卡朋乐队的粉丝
she's a carpenters fan chick for sure

586
00:56:36,038 --> 00:56:39,467
你的意思是是说她当伐木工人时发生的一件事？
Are you mean saying she's has a thing for wood workers?

587
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:42,747
卡朋特就是音乐家，二逼
The Carpenters are musician stupid

588
00:56:43,772 --> 00:56:46,374
哦 原来是音乐啊
Ah music

589
00:56:46,675 --> 00:56:49,868
有时候我很喜欢音乐的
I am rather the fond of the music of the day

590
00:56:53,294 --> 00:56:57,685
我是选择者，创始者
I am a picker I'm a beginner

591
00:56:58,068 --> 00:57:00,406
我也是一个恋爱者
I'm a lover

592
00:57:00,851 --> 00:57:04,871
同时我也是个罪人
and I am a sinner

593
00:57:05,073 --> 00:57:09,777
在阳光下我玩我的音乐
I play my music in the sun

594
00:57:12,297 --> 00:57:14,607
只有莎士比亚可以和我相提并论
Only a Shakespeare as I could

595
00:57:14,609 --> 00:57:16,798
好的
Okay

596
00:57:16,835 --> 00:57:19,128
如果你想和她在一起，你必须改变你的方法
If you want to get with her, you have to change your approach

597
00:57:20,223 --> 00:57:22,732
把你那伦敦式甜蜜的怪异方式
Drop the whole weird sweet London thing

598
00:57:22,923 --> 00:57:25,545
散播在普通的人群中去
hangout with a few normal people

599
00:57:31,891 --> 00:57:34,814
你知道这场战争好的地方是什么吗？
Do you know what good about this war man?

600
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:35,548
赢得胜利？
to win?

601
00:57:35,857 --> 00:57:39,469
现在听我讲 有什么好的地方关于这场战争 （越战）
No, listen up, what good about this war

602
00:57:39,933 --> 00:57:44,783
如果这是最后一场战争的确不错
Is that its so bad its going to be the last war

603
00:57:44,789 --> 00:57:46,919
- 是啊 - 的确
- Yeah  - Yeah

604
00:57:47,053 --> 00:57:49,587
但是最后的战争
and this last war

605
00:57:50,745 --> 00:57:52,737
什么时候到来？
When?

606
00:57:55,343 --> 00:57:58,021
和平会来到的
Peace will made out

607
00:57:59,173 --> 00:58:02,040
和平战胜所有的战争
Peace wins every war

608
00:58:02,043 --> 00:58:04,120
- 每一场战争 -嗯
- Every war  -Yeah

609
00:58:06,465 --> 00:58:10,606
你说的是和平
You speak of peace

610
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:18,210
我一直在棺木里度过将近2个世纪
I have spent the last two centuries locked in a box

611
00:58:19,297 --> 00:58:22,075
只能盯着一片虚无
staring in the all consuming void

612
00:58:22,287 --> 00:58:26,618
阴影反成了一种希望
the dark shadows of ones hopes

613
00:58:28,676 --> 00:58:34,834
-哇，被锁了2个世纪？- 没错
- Wow, locked for 2 centuries? - Indeed

614
00:58:35,228 --> 00:58:38,393
但是有个伟大的目标让我
But with great purpose let me thinks

615
00:58:38,588 --> 00:58:44,549
坚信我会找到真爱
for I believe that I have found my one true love

616
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:48,469
矣，我却不知道如何才能取得她的温情
Alas I know not how to win her tender affection

617
00:58:48,471 --> 00:58:52,142
我还担心我进不了她的视线里
but I fear that I have no willing in her eyes

618
00:58:53,251 --> 00:58:56,073
- 他们说的就是我们  - 对
- That what they say about us  - Yeah

619
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,971
我算老几啊
Where I'm from

620
00:58:59,973 --> 00:59:07,945
只要把钱给她的父亲就可以得到女孩的爱....或者是羊
the love of a woman is won by giving money to her father ... or sheep

621
00:59:08,727 --> 00:59:11,884
如果让爱更加真诚
and if love is true enough

622
00:59:11,887 --> 00:59:16,152
或许两样都要
perhaps the combination of the two

623
00:59:16,597 --> 00:59:20,033
女人不会在意钱
women don't care about money

624
00:59:20,586 --> 00:59:23,168
或者羊
or sheep

625
00:59:24,367 --> 00:59:27,017
你确定？
Are you absolutely certain?

626
00:59:27,928 --> 00:59:32,477
爱情，就像老鼠爱大米，先生
Love, chicks dig love, man

627
00:59:32,482 --> 00:59:34,476
- 是的 - 嗯
- Yeah - Yeah

628
00:59:35,349 --> 00:59:36,929
是的
Yes

629
00:59:37,169 --> 00:59:41,645
我想起了埃里克西格尔精彩小说-爱的故事里面所写的
I remind of the line Eric Siegel wonderful novel, The Love Story

630
00:59:45,389 --> 00:59:52,032
爱意味着永远不用说出口
Love means never having to say

631
00:59:56,875 --> 00:59:59,437
对不起
you are sorry

632
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:01,578
然而请要记住要有真诚的后悔之意
however please know that is with sincere regret

633
01:00:02,543 --> 01:00:05,360
现在我必须要杀死你们
that I must now kill all of you

634
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:08,463
啊
Yeah

635
01:00:19,832 --> 01:00:23,225
不，真实杰出，尽管是在理论上
No, its brilliant, theoretically anyway

636
01:00:23,247 --> 01:00:26,034
通过一系列的输血净化你的血
series of transfusion to try and purify your blood

637
01:00:26,354 --> 01:00:29,677
但我的灵魂依然存在
and my soul exists

638
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:35,515
我应当警告你 巴纳巴斯 它会有很小的可能性会失效
I shall warn you Barnabas, there's a slight chance it wont work

639
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,584
正是因为这样，他们才会叫你待在医学院里学医
This is exactly the kind of thing they teach you in medical school

640
01:00:37,647 --> 01:00:39,666
要有信心 医生
You must have faith doctor

641
01:00:40,787 --> 01:00:43,026
当人可以成为一个怪物时
When as a man can become a monster

642
01:00:43,029 --> 01:00:45,459
怪物也可以变成一个人
any monster can become a man

643
01:00:45,461 --> 01:00:47,576
为什么你想要成为一个人，巴纳巴斯？
Why do you want to become a man, Barnabas?

644
01:00:47,578 --> 01:00:50,452
你为什么要选择放弃永恒的青春？
Why do you chose to give up the gift of eternal youth?

645
01:00:50,548 --> 01:00:54,249
看着我，每年我都要衰老
and look at me, every year I look half as pretty and twice as strong

646
01:00:54,923 --> 01:01:00,120
这没错，夫人，但你现在已经是
That is true, Madam, you must have started as the most beautiful creature

647
01:01:00,378 --> 01:01:02,998
在地球表面上最美的生物了
lived on the surface of the Earth

648
01:01:07,806 --> 01:01:08,339
巴纳巴斯
Barnabas

649
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:13,926
你知道什么叫医生和病人的隐私吗？
Are you aware of the concept of doctor and patient confidentiality?

650
01:01:14,417 --> 01:01:16,143
不知道
No

651
01:01:16,445 --> 01:01:19,513
也许你会好心地开导我
Perhaps you would be kind enough to enlighten me

652
01:01:20,401 --> 01:01:22,451
没问题
Alright

653
01:01:36,147 --> 01:01:37,951
巴纳巴斯
Barnabas

654
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,487
维多利亚
Ah Victoria

655
01:01:40,632 --> 01:01:42,499
你介意我跟着你吗？
Mind if I tag along?

656
01:01:42,972 --> 01:01:45,441
没有比这更让人开心了
nothing would make me happier

657
01:01:45,716 --> 01:01:47,443
你是来这里看海潮的吗？
Do you come for the stream?

658
01:01:47,446 --> 01:01:50,004
事实上 我是下来找 戴维的
Actually I came down looking for David

659
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,162
天知道他跑哪去了
God knows where run off to now

660
01:01:52,286 --> 01:01:54,438
如果能在圣诞节看到他，我们已经很幸运了
We will be lucky if we see him before Christmas

661
01:01:54,568 --> 01:01:56,310
他是个不错的小伙子
He's a fine lad

662
01:01:56,312 --> 01:01:59,923
我曾经也像他那样好奇和烦人
He but curious and annoying as I was

663
01:02:00,445 --> 01:02:01,725
他非常崇拜你
he idolizes you

664
01:02:01,762 --> 01:02:03,380
包括你和他母亲
Between you and his mother,

665
01:02:03,383 --> 01:02:05,780
我和他谈不了其他任何东西
I can't get him to talk about anything else

666
01:02:06,453 --> 01:02:11,970
你相信他，就是他可以看到她母亲并且和她讲话吗？
Do you believe him, that he see her and speak to her?

667
01:02:13,468 --> 01:02:16,915
至少我相信他是一个在寻求安慰的寂寞男孩
Part of me believes that he's a lonely boy looking for comfort

668
01:02:18,221 --> 01:02:22,180
我相信这世上有些事是我们不能理解的
part of me believes in things in this world we don't understand

669
01:02:22,329 --> 01:02:26,582
例如魔法盒、死亡，还有命运
Things like magic and death, destiny

670
01:02:28,573 --> 01:02:32,657
我一直在猜，如果能让他快乐，别人怎么认为也没什么大不了
I guess a long it makes him happy, it doesn't matter what anyone believe

671
01:02:34,722 --> 01:02:37,076
完美的吐槽
Elegantly put

672
01:02:40,512 --> 01:02:43,310
或者我们对于安琪太过于认真了
Maybe we're getting too work up about this Angie

673
01:02:43,313 --> 01:02:45,907
我的意思是说他们只不过是装腔作势和翻修房子
I mean they spook up the canary and renovated the house,

674
01:02:45,911 --> 01:02:48,151
那怎么样，我们仍然掌握着95%的份额了
so what? We still hold things on 95% of it

675
01:02:48,153 --> 01:02:51,844
- 掌控着整个大浅滩-他说的没错
- grinding the Grand Banks- He's right

676
01:02:51,848 --> 01:02:55,147
这并不意味着任何人都可以碰我们的底线
This doesn't mean anything to our bottom line

677
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:58,071
这并不意味着任何人？
doesn't mean anything?

678
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:03,541
这并不意味着任何人
Doesn't mean anything?

679
01:03:04,631 --> 01:03:09,122
我的曾祖母创立天使湾就是为了如此
My great great grandmother started Angel Bay to show those

680
01:03:09,127 --> 01:03:13,985
柯林斯家族，他们没有自己海域
Collins, they didn't own water

681
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:17,612
他们不会放低他们的身价来接近我们的
they couldn't look down their entitle nose at us

682
01:03:17,616 --> 01:03:21,085
布沙尔已经掌控超过2个世纪的时间了
Bouchard woman enslaved for over 2 centuries

683
01:03:23,252 --> 01:03:27,603
牺牲他们生命来捍卫现在的这个家业
Sacrificing their lives to build this business

684
01:03:28,529 --> 01:03:31,704
这就意味着我们有一些事要做了。先生们
So that means something gentlemen

685
01:03:31,708 --> 01:03:34,484
我绝不会让这家公司被那些柯林斯给击倒的
and I'll be damned if I let this company destroyed by those Collins

686
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:38,674
安排召开会议
call an arranged meeting

687
01:03:46,131 --> 01:03:49,237
卖给你？绝不
Sell to you? Never

688
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:53,721
没有人能把金钱凌驾于家族荣誉至上
One cannot put a price on the restoration of the family honor

689
01:03:54,546 --> 01:03:56,996
我会的
let me try

690
01:03:57,799 --> 01:03:58,981
巴纳巴斯 柯林斯的支票
Check for Barnabas Collins

691
01:03:58,983 --> 01:04:00,908
1 750 000
ONE MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED & FIFTY THOUSAND

692
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,672
我不知道我的商业头脑会让你这么害怕
I had no idea that my business acumen giving you such spasm

693
01:04:08,712 --> 01:04:12,174
催眠渔民不是商业智慧 巴纳巴斯
hypnotizing fishermen isn't business acumen Barnabas

694
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:16,201
- 那是我的条件 - 这是我的条件
- Those are my terms - This are my term

695
01:04:16,452 --> 01:04:21,977
去你的，下地狱让撒旦去吮吸
go is thou to hell and swiftly please Satan hedonist suckle

696
01:04:21,982 --> 01:04:24,489
你那诅咒的乳房吧
of your disease tits

697
01:04:24,492 --> 01:04:27,679
没有人像你这样对我讲话
Oh, no one talks like you anymore Barnabas

698
01:04:27,682 --> 01:04:30,372
是的，的确
Yes, indeed

699
01:04:30,629 --> 01:04:34,271
对于我，这个年纪仍然保持神秘色彩
I must say that this age does still remain a mystery to me

700
01:04:34,615 --> 01:04:37,702
给我一个好的理由为什么不直接杀了你
Give me one good reason why shouldn't kill you this instant

701
01:04:37,902 --> 01:04:42,164
- 因为我会杀了你如果你尝试这样做得话 -不可能
- If I'll kill you if you try- Impossible

702
01:04:42,603 --> 01:04:45,078
那将需要仁慈心怀，而你没有
That would requires mercy

703
01:04:46,172 --> 01:04:50,964
你反而将我变成了一个怪物 -我们都是怪物
- instead had made me a monster - We're both monsters, Barnabas

704
01:04:52,067 --> 01:04:55,771
就像一山二虎
Just two big fish in a itty bitty pond

705
01:04:56,431 --> 01:05:00,694
现在，二虎相争，必有一伤
Now, we can either fight until one of us is dead

706
01:05:00,728 --> 01:05:02,559
或者
or

707
01:05:03,336 --> 01:05:05,836
我们可以联盟
we can mate

708
01:05:09,218 --> 01:05:12,336
那些弱小的势力
Little fish together

709
01:05:12,385 --> 01:05:16,312
几个世纪以来我承认我对你感到非常愤怒同时
I'll be honest I was really angry at you for a century or so

710
01:05:17,776 --> 01:05:22,606
不断地看着你的家族蠕动着
sure it was hmm watching your family squirm

711
01:05:22,605 --> 01:05:28,439
消亡这就像是频临死亡的蚂蚁
and burn away like ants under magnifying glass

712
01:05:28,672 --> 01:05:33,277
同时那也有趣的科学家族处处遇阻
and yes it was fun being adored as the Collins name hurdle

713
01:05:33,276 --> 01:05:36,445
绝望的不断流失自己的财富
going wealthy on act of their despair

714
01:05:36,445 --> 01:05:38,968
但是太迟了
but lately

715
01:05:39,135 --> 01:05:41,316
太迟了以至于它还是发生了
Lately it just been

716
01:05:42,682 --> 01:05:44,992
孤独
Lonely

717
01:05:45,828 --> 01:05:48,566
我们与其他人是不同的，巴纳巴斯
We're different from this people Barnabas

718
01:05:48,566 --> 01:05:51,186
我们比他们更强
We're better than they are

719
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:53,379
那就是
That's why

720
01:05:53,588 --> 01:05:55,893
我怀念你的原因
I miss you

721
01:05:56,037 --> 01:06:01,352
你是唯一我不能烧死的蚂蚁
You're the only ant I could not burn

722
01:06:02,778 --> 01:06:06,647
你到底想要什么，安吉利？-你的爱
- What is it you want Angelique? - Your love

723
01:06:07,442 --> 01:06:09,514
你还爱着我不是吗?
You do still love me don't you?

724
01:06:09,514 --> 01:06:12,587
深藏在你冰冷的内心深处
Somewhere deep down in that cold beating heart

725
01:06:12,786 --> 01:06:18,097
放手吧，即使是月老也不会成全我们这般可恶的组合
my dear even aphrodite herself cannot consult a more odious union

726
01:06:18,229 --> 01:06:21,232
-那说明可以让我与你结盟？ -用什么？另一个诅咒？
- What if I mate you? - With what? A spell?

727
01:06:21,232 --> 01:06:24,517
扮家家酒那并不是爱
Little dolls and pins that is not love

728
01:06:24,666 --> 01:06:27,388
用这个
With this

729
01:06:27,652 --> 01:06:30,434
这个你一度渴望的身体
The body you once begged me for

730
01:06:31,553 --> 01:06:34,706
我必须承认，他们还在保质期
I must admit, they have not aged a day

731
01:06:34,885 --> 01:06:37,155
我想要这一切结束，巴纳巴斯
I'm willing to start over Barnabas

732
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:41,352
我想要和你重归旧好
I'm willing to call a truce if just take me

733
01:06:43,595 --> 01:06:48,039
我不再像以前那样冲动了 - 我能试着改变
- I am not as I once was - I could change that

734
01:06:48,248 --> 01:06:52,690
那我如果拒绝呢？ -我会带走你索爱的所有人
- and if I refuse? - I take it with whom you loved

735
01:06:52,786 --> 01:06:56,806
开始就是你所无比恋爱的小可怜
Starting with that little creature that you been eyeing so fondly

736
01:06:57,070 --> 01:07:00,544
那个像是Jossete的姑娘
The one that looks like Jossete

737
01:07:01,357 --> 01:07:04,355
好吧
Well then

738
01:07:04,508 --> 01:07:09,666
我猜，现在无法抗拒了
I suppose, strictly unopposed now

739
01:07:10,628 --> 01:07:12,462
我现在
I must now

740
01:07:13,027 --> 01:07:17,361
要挑衅背负恶魔之名的女人了
Defiant the most enduring the women of Satan

741
01:08:15,373 --> 01:08:20,194
这真是令人后悔的转变
That was regrettable turn of events

742
01:08:20,486 --> 01:08:24,185
你不需要感到后悔 -是
- You didn't seem to regret it - Yes

743
01:08:25,597 --> 01:08:30,984
看起来就算是已死之人对于活人来说我还是虚弱不堪
Seems that even in death,I have the weakness for a living flesh

744
01:08:31,622 --> 01:08:34,139
尤其对于你来讲
especially yours

745
01:08:34,138 --> 01:08:36,411
那是多么可惜用这样冷酷的方式来修辞如此有爱的事实
What a cold way to describe something so interesting

746
01:08:38,495 --> 01:08:40,715
可能
perhaps

747
01:08:45,838 --> 01:08:49,566
但我不会再屈服于你的魅力
but I cannot succumb to your charm ever again

748
01:08:50,245 --> 01:08:54,124
请原谅我
Please, forgive me

749
01:08:56,941 --> 01:08:59,747
如果我得不到你属于我的爱
if I can't have you my love,

750
01:08:59,781 --> 01:09:02,494
那我将会毁了你
I'll destroy you

751
01:09:17,537 --> 01:09:19,341
五分钟或更久
Five more minutes

752
01:09:20,084 --> 01:09:22,826
这是非常幼稚的节目
this is a very silly play

753
01:09:25,727 --> 01:09:28,783
是啊，这是我们唯一能到达的阶段
Yeah well its the only station we got around here

754
01:09:29,208 --> 01:09:30,744
感觉怎么样？
How are we doing?

755
01:09:30,744 --> 01:09:34,672
我还没感觉到我更像人类
I do not feel as I becoming more human yet

756
01:09:40,256 --> 01:09:43,219
- 给我一点时间       - 时间
- Give it some time  - Time

757
01:09:43,758 --> 01:09:47,177
关于时间我有很不幸的经历
I have unfortunate access of

758
01:09:57,340 --> 01:10:02,074
我最喜欢露西火红色的头发
My favourite thing about Lucy is her crazy red hair

759
01:10:02,179 --> 01:10:04,545
我的意思是盯着她的头发看
I mean look at her red hair

760
01:10:04,545 --> 01:10:07,792
我第二喜欢的有关与她的
and my second favourite thing about her

761
01:10:07,791 --> 01:10:11,326
就是她闪着光的粉色蝴蝶结
is her nice shiny pink bow

762
01:10:11,326 --> 01:10:13,568
不要，求求你
No, please

763
01:10:13,567 --> 01:10:17,484
我求求你
Please, I beg of you

764
01:10:17,483 --> 01:10:19,996
妈妈，求求你
Mommy, please

765
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:23,960
妈妈。爸爸，救命
Mummy, daddy, help me

766
01:10:24,994 --> 01:10:27,375
求求你们
Please

767
01:10:28,987 --> 01:10:31,180
救我
help me

768
01:10:55,002 --> 01:10:55,517
救救我
help me

769
01:10:55,917 --> 01:10:58,107
要我帮你什么？
help you what?

770
01:11:05,845 --> 01:11:10,335
- 什么？ - 一个盛大的舞会
- A what? - A ball and a splendid one

771
01:11:10,436 --> 01:11:14,715
- 一个舞会？邀请谁？ - 全城的居民
- A ball? For who? - The entire town of course

772
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:17,152
你不知道全镇的人都在恨我们吗？
Don't you know that the entire town kinda hate us?

773
01:11:17,151 --> 01:11:21,081
宴会是权力和身份最好的证明
Ball are the illustration of power

774
01:11:21,445 --> 01:11:25,237
宴会将会巩固我们家族的地位
Balls how ruling class remains ruling class

775
01:11:25,237 --> 01:11:28,701
正是我一直说的，这个家族需要举办一些宴会
Exactly what I've been saying,this family could use some Balls

776
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:31,564
确实，柯林斯家族一直都有
Indeed and the Collins family have always

777
01:11:31,565 --> 01:11:34,701
举行过规模最大以及最好的宴会
held the biggest and the most wonderful Balls

778
01:11:36,666 --> 01:11:39,044
巴纳巴斯说得对
Barnabus has a point

779
01:11:40,044 --> 01:11:42,242
是时候我们打开大门
its about time we open some door around

780
01:11:42,735 --> 01:11:44,843
让那些乡下人明白我们已经回来了
Show the peasant that we're back in action

781
01:11:46,939 --> 01:11:48,920
人们不再关注于愚蠢的舞会了
People don't throw balls anymore stupid

782
01:11:49,566 --> 01:11:50,519
他们不关注？
They do not?

783
01:11:51,167 --> 01:11:53,495
他们关注时下发生的一切
They throw happening

784
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:58,887
那他们怎么才会对我们的舞会感兴趣？
and how do they throw this happening?

785
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:03,896
好吧，首先最重要的是你需要一个旋转球灯
Well first thing first,you'll need a mirrored ball

786
01:12:03,901 --> 01:12:07,281
- 无论那是什么，我们都会拥有的 - 河里会有很多镜子的
- Whatever that is, we should have it - The rivers has lots of mirrors

787
01:12:07,367 --> 01:12:09,148
凯若琳
Caroline

788
01:12:09,499 --> 01:12:13,173
我们会拥有很多的
We shall have lot of it

789
01:12:13,327 --> 01:12:15,036
同时
and

790
01:12:15,429 --> 01:12:18,117
爱丽丝 库伯乐队
Alice Cooper

791
01:12:18,435 --> 01:12:22,533
我好像记得有爱丽丝 库伯 这样一个人
I seem to recall Alice Cooper from my youth

792
01:12:23,463 --> 01:12:27,252
-她还在柯林港居住？ - 大概是吧 (才怪)
- Has she reside in Collins Port? - Not exactly

793
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:31,985
好吧，尽管如此她也是我们的客人
Well she should be our guest nonetheless

794
01:12:41,842 --> 01:12:43,398
你好
Hello

795
01:12:44,014 --> 01:12:45,638
谢谢你邀请我
Thank you for having us

796
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:47,593
晚上好，欢迎来到柯林堡
Good evening, welcome to Collins Wood

797
01:12:47,595 --> 01:12:50,965
这将是一个好的开始
I got to handed to you, this is a happening

798
01:12:51,501 --> 01:12:54,020
唯一令人遗憾的是爱丽丝库伯
the only thing missing is Alice Cooper

799
01:12:54,267 --> 01:12:56,506
也许你需要进去交点朋友
Perhaps you should go in and make acquittance

800
01:12:56,509 --> 01:12:58,648
在晚会的娱乐消遣的同时
of yourself with the evening entertainment

801
01:13:38,258 --> 01:13:41,491
我所见过最丑的女人
Ugliest woman I've ever seen

802
01:14:03,412 --> 01:14:07,282
戴维，那个管理礼服的女服务员呢？
Mater David where is the female coat attendant?

803
01:14:07,656 --> 01:14:10,704
我爸爸正在里面跟她谈话
My dad talking to her inside

804
01:14:12,577 --> 01:14:14,849
让我在外面守着
told me to keep my fucking out

805
01:14:14,852 --> 01:14:19,441
我确定他会的，戴维你做了一件了不起的事
I'm sure he did David.You've done a marvelous job

806
01:14:19,826 --> 01:14:23,422
我想让你和其他人去看爱丽丝 库伯的表演
I would like to watch Alice Cooper with the others

807
01:14:24,021 --> 01:14:30,546
-我的爸爸说过让我...- 去看那个库伯女
- My father said.. - Go and watch The Cooper woman.

808
01:14:43,403 --> 01:14:45,961
你是对的关于那个家伙
You're right about the stuff

809
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,025
无所谓，没有人比你更好了，小猫咪
nothing but best for you pussy cat

810
01:14:49,587 --> 01:14:51,365
那个小孩是谁？
Who is the kid?

811
01:14:51,367 --> 01:14:54,856
我不知道，我从没见过他
I have no idea, I never saw him before

812
01:14:59,267 --> 01:15:01,222
来这儿
Come here

813
01:15:12,733 --> 01:15:15,660
妈妈，爸爸去哪了？
Mummy, where's daddy?

814
01:15:16,022 --> 01:15:18,526
他离开我们太久了
He's been gone for so long

815
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:21,095
他还会回家来吗？
Will he ever coming home?

816
01:15:45,130 --> 01:15:47,621
你在外面做什么,亲爱的？
Whatever are you doing outside, my dear?

817
01:15:47,624 --> 01:15:52,834
- 你会得重感冒的 - 我喜欢那个歌手 巴纳巴斯
- You'll catch a death of cold - I like him Barnabas

818
01:15:53,228 --> 01:15:55,683
因为他歌里满是谎言
He lied

819
01:15:57,541 --> 01:16:02,856
我一直压抑着情感因为我害怕当你听到时会离我而去
I have withheld my tender affection of fear for pity you ran hearing it

820
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:07,642
我也不再与其他灵魂谈及我的感受
and I am not spoken my feeling to another soul

821
01:16:07,682 --> 01:16:11,776
你经常说起你是我来生的礼物
You always spoke as if you were my birthday gift

822
01:16:12,653 --> 01:16:14,333
是的
Yes

823
01:16:17,771 --> 01:16:21,049
我不知道为什么我感觉我可以
I don't know why but for some reason I feel like I can

824
01:16:21,053 --> 01:16:23,407
告诉你我的一切
tell you anything

825
01:16:23,624 --> 01:16:26,439
那种感觉好像我一直都认识你
and its like I known you forever

826
01:16:26,442 --> 01:16:30,206
- 是的 - 可能我是
- Yes  - and if I was

827
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:33,153
被催眠了
hypnotic

828
01:16:33,192 --> 01:16:35,982
也许，但是请稍等
Yes but wait no

829
01:16:36,012 --> 01:16:40,247
我要向你保证我绝没有用诡计来骗取你的爱
I have use no such trickery to summon your heart I assure you

830
01:16:40,697 --> 01:16:44,664
我不知道为什么，我一直感觉到什么东西一直指引我到这里
I do not know why it is, I just know that always something pulling me here

831
01:16:44,704 --> 01:16:47,285
把我带向了柯林堡
Pulling me to Collins Port

832
01:16:47,288 --> 01:16:49,426
带向了你
To you

833
01:16:52,295 --> 01:16:54,887
哦，我亲爱的维多利亚，我有冒犯你吗？
Oh my dear Victoria Have I offended thy?

834
01:16:56,014 --> 01:16:59,942
不，对不起，这仅仅是
No, sorry its just

835
01:17:02,054 --> 01:17:05,330
我会回报我所爱的人的
People I love having always love me back

836
01:17:07,775 --> 01:17:10,564
我的家庭送走了我
My own family sent me away

837
01:17:11,602 --> 01:17:13,859
把我困在牢笼里，因为那更简单
trap me under a rock because it was easier

838
01:17:13,863 --> 01:17:16,014
要比拥有一个于总不同
than having a daughter who is different

839
01:17:17,071 --> 01:17:19,841
被咒诅的女儿
Who was cursed

840
01:17:20,339 --> 01:17:23,789
诅咒我能看到其他孩子看不到的东西
Cursed because I saw things other little children didn't

841
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:29,059
对于一个孩子来讲，那是最孤独也是最痛苦的阶段
Its the most loneliest, the most painful years a child could know

842
01:17:30,637 --> 01:17:35,118
现在，不要动，玛吉雅，你只会痛一分钟
Now hold still Maggy, this would only hurt for a minute

843
01:17:40,314 --> 01:17:43,672
虽然是如此的痛苦艰难，我却永远不会丢失我的信仰
as hard as I were, I never lost my will

844
01:17:43,676 --> 01:17:46,033
我需要重见天日
I need to feel the sun on my face again

845
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:48,464
我要逃出这个地方
I want to get out of here

846
01:17:50,241 --> 01:17:53,164
我必须逃出这个地方
I got to get out of here

847
01:17:53,167 --> 01:17:55,789
因此我出去寻找一个新的家庭
So I get out in search of a new home

848
01:17:55,793 --> 01:17:59,210
一种新的生活原理以往的痛苦
a new life far away from that pain

849
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:08,036
即使做梦也难以想象我现在又多么的快乐
Even in my wildest dream, I never thought I feel as happy as I feel now

850
01:18:08,270 --> 01:18:12,712
抛弃自己唯一的骨肉仅仅是因为她拥有某种天赋
to betray ones only kin where she possess a gift

851
01:18:12,894 --> 01:18:15,907
不，维多利亚，那是不可原谅的
No, Victoria it is unforgivable

852
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:22,065
你的父母应该接受无尽的地狱般的折磨
your parents should deserve to boil in hell everlasting suffers

853
01:18:36,263 --> 01:18:38,647
嘿，你没有被邀请
Hey you are not invited

854
01:19:01,255 --> 01:19:04,177
在我余生，我想找一个属于我的地方
for the rest of my life I wanted a place where I belong

855
01:19:04,181 --> 01:19:06,802
一个可以感受家的温暖
a place where I feel at home again

856
01:19:06,901 --> 01:19:09,230
可以感受到爱的地方
feel loved again

857
01:19:09,472 --> 01:19:12,743
我找到了这个地方，就是柯林堡
and I found this place here at collins Wood

858
01:19:14,967 --> 01:19:17,335
就是这儿
and here

859
01:19:38,102 --> 01:19:40,744
我们必须不断努力
We must intensify our efforts

860
01:19:40,746 --> 01:19:43,479
我又想变成人类了
I want resume the need to be human again

861
01:19:43,517 --> 01:19:46,348
- 我需要解释  -我的神
- I can explain it - My God

862
01:19:46,493 --> 01:19:48,628
你不是用你的血来让我变成人类
You're not using your blood to make me human

863
01:19:48,729 --> 01:19:53,107
你想用我的血来获得永生
You're using my blood to make yourself immortal

864
01:19:53,463 --> 01:19:56,878
巴纳巴斯，那不公平，只有你才能有那种天赋
Barnabas, you have a gift it isn't fair to keep all to yourself

865
01:19:56,881 --> 01:20:00,164
神圣的柯林家族授予你无比的信任
sacred Collins family took you in the bestow trust upon you

866
01:20:00,168 --> 01:20:02,711
- 你却不留余地地背叛他们的信任 - 我很抱歉
- You em-bracingly betray their trust - I'm sorry

867
01:20:03,714 --> 01:20:07,747
我不想渐渐衰老，我想要变回原来的美貌
I just don't what to grow old I want to be beautiful again

868
01:20:08,472 --> 01:20:10,045
我想要永生，就像你一样
I want to life forever, like you

869
01:20:10,047 --> 01:20:12,013
我恐怕那是不可能的了
I'm afraid that is out of the question

870
01:20:12,812 --> 01:20:16,659
一个人大概拥有5升的血
A man contains some 5 quarter of blood

871
01:20:16,663 --> 01:20:22,595
我能够吸干他少于7.5秒钟
which of course I can consume in mere 7.5 seconds

872
01:20:22,636 --> 01:20:25,250
但对于你，亲
But you, my dear

873
01:20:25,252 --> 01:20:29,076
我将会控制在5秒以内
I will drink it less than five seconds

874
01:20:30,115 --> 01:20:33,284
请不要杀我。你是一个好人，你是一个绅士
Please don't kill me. You're a good man, you're a gentlemen

875
01:20:33,287 --> 01:20:35,520
-求求你，求求你  - 女士
- Please, please  - Madam

876
01:20:35,523 --> 01:20:41,141
我不好也不是绅士而且我也绝不会原谅背叛
I'm neither good nor gentle I do not forgive

877
01:20:57,589 --> 01:20:59,946
我必须告诉你，威利
I should tell you Willy

878
01:20:59,949 --> 01:21:02,908
如果你向别人走漏一点风声
if you ever speak a word of this to anyone

879
01:21:02,912 --> 01:21:06,215
我会用一种不友好的手段杀掉你
I should have kill you in an unpleasant manner

880
01:21:06,253 --> 01:21:10,373
不要担心，巴纳巴斯先生，我从来都不喜欢这个婊子
Do not worry Mr. B I never liked the bitch anyway

881
01:21:53,492 --> 01:21:56,870
拜托，我知道你在这里
Come on, I know you're here

882
01:21:58,393 --> 01:22:01,150
美丽工艺品，不是吗？
Beautiful workmanship isn't it?

883
01:22:01,822 --> 01:22:04,672
我只是在找...
I'm just looking for the

884
01:22:04,679 --> 01:22:06,463
这个?
this?

885
01:22:07,919 --> 01:22:10,674
我恐怖那没什么值得去偷的
There nothing worth stealing I'm afraid

886
01:22:10,847 --> 01:22:15,459
很可惜，伊丽莎白只用它来存放羽毛球的器具
Sadly, Elizabeth use it for badminton equipment

887
01:22:16,785 --> 01:22:19,236
那正是我要找的
That what I was looking for

888
01:22:22,826 --> 01:22:24,304
你要干什么？
What are you?

889
01:22:24,306 --> 01:22:26,399
我打算做一些事情
I was about to do something

890
01:22:26,402 --> 01:22:29,812
驱除那些削弱我存在的潜在因素
repellent that sickens me to my very core

891
01:22:34,672 --> 01:22:37,403
我打算给你一个机会
I going to give you a choice

892
01:22:38,010 --> 01:22:41,770
- 什么机会？ -你或者留在柯林堡
- What choice? - Either you remain in collins Wood

893
01:22:42,365 --> 01:22:44,402
然后时时刻刻
and devote all your every waking

894
01:22:44,405 --> 01:22:47,077
做一个好父亲
moment to be become an exemplary father

895
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:52,492
戴维一直想要的那种父亲
A father David so desperately wants and deserve

896
01:22:53,126 --> 01:22:56,211
- 还有吗？ - 还有就是你滚！
- or?  - or you leave

897
01:22:56,450 --> 01:23:02,383
带笔足够的钱，滚到除这以外的任何地方，去过自私的生活
with sufficient to live your life peeving selfish lives else where

898
01:23:38,678 --> 01:23:42,805
当我们需要霍夫曼医生的时候，她究竟去哪里了
Where on earth is Dr. Hoffman when we needed her

899
01:23:43,214 --> 01:23:45,135
的确
Indeed

900
01:24:24,396 --> 01:24:27,787
巴纳巴斯，你身上着火了
Barnabas, you're on fire

901
01:25:08,384 --> 01:25:11,471
我命令你给我解除诅咒
I demand that you release me from my curse

902
01:25:11,475 --> 01:25:12,335
太迟了
You're late

903
01:25:16,858 --> 01:25:21,167
- 这是什么？ - 你这些天都在喝的东西
- What is that? - The only thing you drink these days

904
01:25:24,232 --> 01:25:26,176
哪里来的？
Where does it come from?

905
01:25:26,178 --> 01:25:29,754
没人会知道的，我保证
No one you know I promise

906
01:25:34,974 --> 01:25:37,578
我早料到你会再闯进来的
I knew it wouldn't be long before you barge in begging

907
01:25:37,581 --> 01:25:40,344
求我给你解除诅咒
me to making you mortal again

908
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,600
现在那个霍夫曼医生不在了
Now that Doctor Hoffman isn't around

909
01:25:42,603 --> 01:25:45,139
也就没人能给你输血
anymore to give you a your little transfusion

910
01:25:45,414 --> 01:25:47,071
是的
Yes

911
01:25:47,108 --> 01:25:48,791
这非常可惜
Yes, it was ashamed

912
01:25:49,098 --> 01:25:53,698
她有事突然走了
she was caught away in so suddenly

913
01:25:55,012 --> 01:25:55,671
有意思
Interesting

914
01:25:55,673 --> 01:26:00,055
我可不知道有谁没事会跑海底去呆着
I do not any people who had business meeting at the bottom of the ocean

915
01:26:02,465 --> 01:26:04,320
她是个骗子
It was a liar

916
01:26:04,322 --> 01:26:06,619
她偷我的血
She was stealing my blood

917
01:26:06,621 --> 01:26:09,042
我们也不是什么正人君子
Aren't we being hypocrites?

918
01:26:09,045 --> 01:26:13,056
你应该相当熟悉你的血也少坑蒙拐骗来的
Lying and stealing blood are things you rather familiar with

919
01:26:13,267 --> 01:26:14,949
是的
Yes

920
01:26:15,342 --> 01:26:18,386
我杀了霍夫曼医生。工人
I Killed Dr Hoffman and the work men

921
01:26:18,622 --> 01:26:21,970
还有那些很潮的小青年也是我杀的
and some very nice and shaping young people

922
01:26:21,989 --> 01:26:23,398
不过
but know this

923
01:26:24,553 --> 01:26:27,862
我每杀一个人
with each life I take

924
01:26:27,881 --> 01:26:31,166
我的灵魂就消亡一部分
a piece of my soul dies

925
01:26:31,185 --> 01:26:34,711
我杀人还不都是
I kill only because I'm compelled to

926
01:26:35,053 --> 01:26:38,669
被你用巫术和诅咒逼的
compelled by your witchcraft, by your curse

927
01:26:40,177 --> 01:26:42,082
你为什么要这么对我？
Why have you done this to me?

928
01:26:42,877 --> 01:26:44,942
不好意思
Its ashamed

929
01:26:44,954 --> 01:26:49,343
你是如此令我着迷
You know you been smart enough to love me

930
01:26:49,394 --> 01:26:50,647
一切都会过去的
I would have let it go

931
01:26:50,655 --> 01:26:53,495
你他妈的睁眼说瞎话
Speak plainly snake

932
01:26:54,543 --> 01:26:57,773
我让你的小女友跳了回悬崖
I sent you little girlfriend off the cliff once before

933
01:26:57,791 --> 01:27:01,068
是什么让你认为这事我还干的出来？
What makes you think I wont do it again?

934
01:27:04,766 --> 01:27:08,398
我有一个个提案，巴纳巴斯
I'm gonna offer you a business proposal Barnabas

935
01:27:08,832 --> 01:27:11,518
最后通牒哦
my final offer

936
01:27:11,755 --> 01:27:15,238
我们一起占了这块地盘
Either you rule this pond of mine side by side

937
01:27:15,408 --> 01:27:18,399
开个夫妻店
partners and lovers

938
01:27:18,708 --> 01:27:20,710
或者
or

939
01:27:20,721 --> 01:27:22,503
我再把你放回你的棺材里去
I put you back in a box

940
01:27:23,843 --> 01:27:27,516
我和你想的正好相反
I already prepared my counter proposal

941
01:27:28,036 --> 01:27:29,889
你的提案太不要脸了
It read thusly

942
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:31,767
你怎么老爱拿你那种老脸一遍遍往
You may strategically place your

943
01:27:31,779 --> 01:27:34,811
我屁股上贴
wonderful pond upon my ass and kiss it repeatedly

944
01:28:16,618 --> 01:28:22,132
沉睡的火焰啊，听我的召唤，回归你的所在
Sleeping flame I summon thy to your form return

945
01:28:24,315 --> 01:28:30,280
把这黑夜烧得如白昼，烧啊烧啊
Make the night as bright as day and burn baby, burn

946
01:29:30,163 --> 01:29:35,421
要让你永远在棺材里呆着可不是件容易的事
Come to realize that shutting you in a box for all eternity is hard

947
01:29:35,650 --> 01:29:37,383
所以我只能这么办了
So here's the deal

948
01:29:39,493 --> 01:29:42,368
我会把你喜欢的东西全毁掉
I'm going to destroy everything you love

949
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:47,727
这样你才会有更多时间来想起咱们z
and you're going to take some more time to think about us

950
01:29:52,209 --> 01:29:55,473
几百年后见，亲爱的
see you in a couple of centuries, lover boy

951
01:30:08,151 --> 01:30:10,294
别生气，巴纳巴斯
Do not dismay, Barnabas

952
01:30:10,306 --> 01:30:13,596
我们能再逃出这个噩梦的
We can again escape this nightmare

953
01:30:13,833 --> 01:30:17,779
说不定十几二十年就够了
perhaps a few decades or so

954
01:30:21,207 --> 01:30:24,158
谁？我听见你了
Hello? I hear you

955
01:30:25,513 --> 01:30:30,267
亲，不管你是谁，别怕
Oh sweet glory be, who ever you are fear not

956
01:30:30,319 --> 01:30:30,799
我不会害你的
I will not harm you

957
01:30:30,803 --> 01:30:33,914
这多少年了？几个世纪？
How many year is it? How many centuries have I?

958
01:30:33,933 --> 01:30:35,488
多久了？
How long have it been?

959
01:30:37,464 --> 01:30:39,359
20分钟
Its been twenty minutes

960
01:30:40,370 --> 01:30:42,276
哦 是戴维，你怎么知道我被关了？
Yes Master David, how on earth did you know I was imprison?

961
01:30:43,634 --> 01:30:47,853
我妈妈告诉我的，你可能以为我秀透了吧
My mother told me, you probably think I'm crazy

962
01:30:47,913 --> 01:30:51,868
年轻人，我可没想那么多
Young man, I think nothing of the sort

963
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:54,771
巴纳巴斯叔叔
Uncle Barnabas

964
01:30:54,970 --> 01:30:57,684
你怎么放条女的内裤在脸上？
Why do you ladies underwear on your face?

965
01:30:57,700 --> 01:31:00,666
这事不能细说，你家人在哪？维多利亚在哪？
Never mind of the matter, where is you family? Where is Victoria

966
01:31:00,683 --> 01:31:01,298
我没有看见，维琪
I hadn't seen Vicky,

967
01:31:01,303 --> 01:31:03,209
但现在所有人都在镇上
but everybody else is in the town

968
01:31:03,220 --> 01:31:07,501
- 我们的产房大火 -我们必须救他们，快过来帮我
- watching our canary burn - We must save them , help me

969
01:31:07,767 --> 01:31:08,597
戴维
Master David

970
01:31:10,029 --> 01:31:13,004
或许你该先把我的链子解开
Perhaps you should unchain me first

971
01:31:13,476 --> 01:31:15,966
汉克，我们得在拐角那再加派一组人手
Hank we need another brigade out in the corner

972
01:31:15,968 --> 01:31:18,795
尽快把人疏散
as quick as you can get this people out of here

973
01:31:18,933 --> 01:31:23,013
大家全部站到警戒线之外
Alright everybody, stand behind the line please

974
01:31:23,524 --> 01:31:27,575
我的天，伊丽莎白火大了
Oh boy Elizabeth going to be furious

975
01:31:28,092 --> 01:31:32,366
- 谢里夫，我们聊聊  - 我没空闲聊
- Sheriff, we need to talk  - I ainˇt got time to chit chat

976
01:31:32,370 --> 01:31:35,315
- 镇子还TMD烧着呢！ - 那你也没时间
- The damn town burning  - You don't have time for proof

977
01:31:35,318 --> 01:31:37,709
看柯林斯家族窝藏杀人犯的证据？
that Collins family is harboring a murderer?

978
01:31:39,948 --> 01:31:44,110
是的，霍夫曼医生和那帮工人都是我杀的
Yes, I killed, Dr Hoffman and the workmen

979
01:31:44,563 --> 01:31:47,798
还有那群正玩的疯狂的小年轻人
and those really pleasant young people

980
01:31:49,852 --> 01:31:51,434
我勒了个去
I'll be damn

981
01:31:52,046 --> 01:31:53,688
想想整个城镇都以他们命名
To think the whole town name after

982
01:31:53,691 --> 01:31:56,692
我打赌柯林斯肯定已经逃了
I be willing to bet that Barnabas has already skipped town

983
01:31:56,695 --> 01:31:58,778
不过我打赌你能找到他
And I be willing to bet you'll find

984
01:31:58,781 --> 01:32:01,904
更多无辜的受害者
the corpses of more of his innocent victims in there

985
01:32:02,057 --> 01:32:06,131
柯林斯家族用谋杀者来重建家族生意
The Collins family has rebuild their business with murder

986
01:32:06,381 --> 01:32:09,910
我们镇决不能容忍这样的事情发生
Well I say not in my town

987
01:32:13,915 --> 01:32:15,399
那有一个柯林斯家族的人
there one of them now

988
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:19,947
他很可能像通过纵火来掩盖他老板的证据
He probably the one who started the fire to cover his boss's track

989
01:32:20,308 --> 01:32:21,747
是时候跑路了
Time to go

990
01:32:46,491 --> 01:32:49,080
威利，发生什么事了
Willie, what on earth happened?

991
01:32:49,452 --> 01:32:53,061
大火，杀人犯，暴民，快跑啊
Fire, the murder angry mob, run

992
01:32:53,979 --> 01:32:55,829
戴维，进屋去
David, go inside

993
01:33:16,653 --> 01:33:18,403
利兹
Liz

994
01:33:18,627 --> 01:33:22,207
抱歉，跟我们走一趟
I'm sorry, we going to have to take you in

995
01:33:22,855 --> 01:33:24,763
你们都要去
all of you

996
01:33:24,967 --> 01:33:26,771
比尔
Bill

997
01:33:26,772 --> 01:33:30,136
柯林斯家族建了这个镇
The Collins family built this town

998
01:33:30,140 --> 01:33:33,595
我们用我们自己的船和网建了这个镇
We built it with our boats and our net

999
01:33:33,741 --> 01:33:38,063
你们就是这样回报我们付出的心血？
The sacrifices of our blood and this is how you repay us

1000
01:33:38,193 --> 01:33:40,952
你们窝藏杀人犯
You been harboring a murderer

1001
01:33:41,173 --> 01:33:43,229
逮捕他们
arrest them

1002
01:33:43,231 --> 01:33:45,991
我很乐意跟你们走
I shall go willingly

1003
01:33:46,028 --> 01:33:49,073
无论等待我的是怎样的处罚
whatever punishment awaits

1004
01:33:49,484 --> 01:33:51,494
借过
provided

1005
01:33:51,746 --> 01:33:55,407
- 没人能动我的家族  - 站那不许动
- no harm falls my family  - Hold it right there

1006
01:34:03,338 --> 01:34:05,409
借过
Provided

1007
01:34:05,446 --> 01:34:08,023
布沙尔跟我都要被抓起来
Miss Bouchard goes with me

1008
01:34:08,317 --> 01:34:11,528
因为她也是个怪物
because she is no less a monster than I

1009
01:34:14,218 --> 01:34:16,785
也许这才是最好的结局，如果
Perhaps it best if

1010
01:34:17,234 --> 01:34:19,878
我们俩都挂掉的话
We're both destroyed

1011
01:34:23,184 --> 01:34:26,916
柯林斯先生，我警告你，退后
Mr Collins, back off, I'm warning you

1012
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:36,873
来啊，杀我啊，让他们看看你到底是个什么东西
Go on, slaughter me, show them what you are

1013
01:34:37,086 --> 01:34:38,850
不
No

1014
01:34:39,023 --> 01:34:41,588
我会让他们看看我们是什么东西
I shall show them what we are

1015
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:58,911
那个男的对安吉做了什么？
What did that man done to Angie?

1016
01:34:59,215 --> 01:35:05,360
不是柯林斯，是安吉，她是女巫
It is not him, it her, she's the witch

1017
01:35:08,565 --> 01:35:10,945
不好意思
Excuse me

1018
01:35:18,330 --> 01:35:21,166
先过我这一关
You got to get through me first lady

1019
01:35:26,890 --> 01:35:29,252
都回家去吧，这没什么可看的
Alright go back to your homes now There's nothing to see here

1020
01:35:31,464 --> 01:35:34,096
你本来应该爱我的，柯林斯
You should've loved me, Barnabas

1021
01:35:34,285 --> 01:35:36,733
如果你还爱我，这些都不该发生的
none of this would've happen if you just you loved me

1022
01:35:36,885 --> 01:35:41,096
我本该灭了你，这一切就都不会发生
I should have destroy you, It wont be nothing but misery

1023
01:35:41,153 --> 01:35:44,529
- 我把心都给了你 -你根本就没有心
- I gave you my hear  - You have no heart

1024
01:35:44,533 --> 01:35:48,596
你就是个天煞孤星，你周围的女人都要死
You're the cursed, woman are done living by you

1025
01:35:48,698 --> 01:35:51,097
朱塞特 霍夫曼医生
Josette, Dr Hoffman

1026
01:35:51,215 --> 01:35:53,722
还有你心爱的维琪
and you beloved Vicky

1027
01:35:54,004 --> 01:35:57,183
我命令你解除她的诅咒
I command you to release her from your curse

1028
01:35:57,186 --> 01:36:00,677
命令我？ 你当我是白痴啊
Command?, you're making me sick

1029
01:36:02,959 --> 01:36:04,760
躲过了
Missed me

1030
01:36:09,442 --> 01:36:12,796
去死吧，你个丑八怪
You hideous serpent go to the gates of hell

1031
01:36:27,035 --> 01:36:30,833
从我的房间滚出去
Get out of my room

1032
01:36:55,258 --> 01:36:57,029
安吉丽科
Angelique

1033
01:36:57,418 --> 01:37:00,618
从我房间滚出去
Get out of my house

1034
01:37:30,703 --> 01:37:33,134
你的房间？
your house?

1035
01:38:02,066 --> 01:38:04,314
够了，这些小把戏
Enough trickery

1036
01:38:06,796 --> 01:38:10,100
- 我好仰慕你。- 表扬我么？
- I worshiped you  - Praised me

1037
01:38:10,913 --> 01:38:15,361
- 我好崇拜你 - 鄙视我么？
- Adore you  - Despise me

1038
01:38:19,605 --> 01:38:21,554
很好
Alright

1039
01:38:23,538 --> 01:38:26,966
如果这个房子是科林斯家族的鲜血铸就
if Collins blood builds this house then

1040
01:38:27,028 --> 01:38:30,147
那就用血洗礼这里的一切
let us bathe it

1041
01:39:44,024 --> 01:39:46,345
离我们远点
let us alone

1042
01:39:46,567 --> 01:39:49,116
凯若琳
Caroline

1043
01:39:51,585 --> 01:39:54,226
凯若琳，上帝啊
Caroline, my God

1044
01:39:55,259 --> 01:39:59,308
我就是个狼人怎么了，我们的事以后再谈
I'm a werewolf okay, lets not make a big deal out of it

1045
01:40:00,888 --> 01:40:03,072
狗咆
Woof

1046
01:40:34,110 --> 01:40:37,242
你对我女人做了什么？
What have you done to my daughter?

1047
01:40:37,246 --> 01:40:39,428
哈哈，利兹
Well, Liz

1048
01:40:39,729 --> 01:40:43,371
你要实现大科林斯的家族梦还需要加点料啊
Your perfect Collins family fantasy lack of substance

1049
01:40:43,474 --> 01:40:47,711
所以呢，当凯若琳还在摇篮里的时候，我派狼人咬了她一下
so I sent the werewolf to bit Caroline in the cradle

1050
01:40:53,086 --> 01:40:56,156
就像我把戴维变成孤儿是最好不过了
Just like I make David no better than a bastard

1051
01:40:56,272 --> 01:40:58,739
当我把他老妈送海底去
When I sent his mummy to the ocean floor

1052
01:40:58,742 --> 01:41:01,157
跟金枪鱼喝茶的时候
to have tea with the tuna

1053
01:41:02,286 --> 01:41:05,078
至于你吧，亲爱的
and as for you my love

1054
01:41:05,073 --> 01:41:08,695
我杀了你爸妈
I killed your mother and father

1055
01:41:11,508 --> 01:41:13,942
我诅咒你家族，巴纳巴斯
I cursed your family, Barnabas

1056
01:41:14,056 --> 01:41:16,307
谁让他们拆散我们
they kept us apart

1057
01:41:16,449 --> 01:41:20,997
他们不知道我们是一类人，我们是上天注定
They never understood we're the same, we were meant to be

1058
01:41:21,668 --> 01:41:23,992
离他远点
Leave him alone

1059
01:41:26,185 --> 01:41:29,739
我想我还是先杀了你吧，孤儿
I think I'll kill you first, Orphan

1060
01:41:31,930 --> 01:41:34,411
戴维 快走
David get out

1061
01:41:34,731 --> 01:41:38,833
- 你的对头是我 -你们所有人我都不会放过
- Your quarrel is with me -My quarrel is with all of you

1062
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:42,306
我警告你，这是你最后一次机会
I'm warning you, this is your last chance

1063
01:41:42,604 --> 01:41:43,991
放了我们
and let us go

1064
01:41:43,993 --> 01:41:47,592
我不放你又能怎么样呢，你个野种
And what will you do if I don't you bastard

1065
01:41:47,758 --> 01:41:50,872
不是我想怎么样，是我妈
Not me, but my mom

1066
01:42:24,706 --> 01:42:27,755
走
Go

1067
01:42:40,250 --> 01:42:43,119
戴维 快走
David, come on

1068
01:42:44,669 --> 01:42:47,018
维利，快起来
Willie, come on

1069
01:43:06,605 --> 01:43:09,249
这就是故事的结局吗？
so this is how it ends?

1070
01:43:12,927 --> 01:43:15,187
如此安静
So quiet

1071
01:43:16,325 --> 01:43:19,539
你就像睡着了一样
as if you were asleep

1072
01:43:19,747 --> 01:43:24,308
你知道有段时间我爱过你
You know there was a time that I might have loved you

1073
01:43:25,050 --> 01:43:28,655
我们曾经也是可以永远在一起的
We could have spent eternity together

1074
01:43:28,694 --> 01:43:31,885
我们现在也可以啊
we still can

1075
01:43:33,156 --> 01:43:36,092
你要的不是爱
You never wanted my love

1076
01:43:36,327 --> 01:43:40,242
- 你要的只是占有我 - 不是的
- You wanted to posses me - No

1077
01:43:41,071 --> 01:43:43,961
我爱你，巴纳巴斯
I love you, Barnabas

1078
01:43:44,223 --> 01:43:47,571
你不可能去爱的，安吉利科
You cannot love, Angelique

1079
01:43:48,048 --> 01:43:51,395
那就是你的诅咒
That is your curse

1080
01:43:55,395 --> 01:44:15,395

1081
01:44:18,847 --> 01:44:20,972
接受它吧
Take it

1082
01:44:46,955 --> 01:44:49,676
维多利亚，维多利亚
Victoria, Victoria

1083
01:45:01,780 --> 01:45:04,128
她朝那山去了
She set for that hill

1084
01:45:19,735 --> 01:45:21,935
我们现在怎么办？
What do we do now?

1085
01:45:22,747 --> 01:45:25,564
该怎么办
What we will always done

1086
01:45:26,416 --> 01:45:28,821
就怎么办
and do

1087
01:46:01,603 --> 01:46:04,119
我还以为失去你了
I thought I lost you

1088
01:46:04,603 --> 01:46:07,356
你已经失去我了
You have lost me

1089
01:46:08,048 --> 01:46:12,011
我生活在阳光底下，巴纳巴斯你生活在阴暗里
I live in the light Barnabas, you live in the shadow

1090
01:46:12,170 --> 01:46:15,026
我会老会死，你却永远不会
I'll grow old and die, you'll live forever

1091
01:46:15,171 --> 01:46:18,371
我们能找到解决办法的，亲爱的
We will find a way, my love

1092
01:46:18,910 --> 01:46:22,197
- 只有一种办法 - 不
- There's only one way - No

1093
01:46:22,503 --> 01:46:26,261
不能眼睁睁看着你跟我遭一样的罪，绝不
I will not see you suffer as I do, never

1094
01:46:30,005 --> 01:46:31,812
不
No

1095
01:47:05,062 --> 01:47:09,028
维多利亚，亲爱的维多利亚
Victoria, my sweet Victoria

1096
01:47:18,184 --> 01:47:20,274
维多利亚Victoria

1097

朱塞特
Josette

1098
01:47:47,083 --> 01:47:51,481
古话说，血浓于水
It is said that blood is thicker than water

1099
01:47:51,628 --> 01:47:55,464
血在定义我们，约束我们
It is what defined us, binds us

1100
01:47:55,620 --> 01:47:57,609
也在诅咒我们
curses us

1101
01:47:57,725 --> 01:48:00,835
我的名字叫巴纳巴斯 柯林斯
My name is Barnabas Collins

1102
01:48:00,967 --> 01:48:06,474
我的诅咒最后被解除了
and my curse have finally been broken
