是啊 也许他很让人搞不懂
Yeah. He may be totally inaccessible emotionally,

73
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,620
但他确实知道如何装家具
but he does know how to install some really cool crap.

00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,590
好好享受吧 如果我今年能回家就幸运了

-We're fed up with all these -OK,OK.

83
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,780
有钱人家的傲慢孩子 还有他们的抱怨

有时候我希望能快点度过接下来五年
Sometimes I wish I could fast-forward through the next five years...

103
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,220
真烦她开始谈自己的人生规划
I hate when she starts to talk about her life plan.

104
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,560
-让我感觉自己很没目标  -跟我说说吧
-It makes me feel so unfocused. -Tell me about it.

105
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,760
我都大四了 换了六次专业
I'm a senior,and I've changed my major,like,six times.

106
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,530
-我连个专业都没有  -得了吧
-I don't even have a major. -Oh,please.

107
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,680
等你有了

111

我得学莎士比亚
I have to take Shakespeare.

112
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,310
愚蠢的人文要求
Some sort of stupid humanities requirement.

113
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,890
行了 下次再说上课或工作
That's it. The next time you talk about classes or work,

114
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,620
你就得喝一杯

115
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,090
只是莎士比亚太没用了
It's just that Shakespeare is so useless...

当然
Of course.

127
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,020
爱德华 有一天 你会成为
Edvard,one day,you will be

128
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,230
世界历史上延续最久的君主制
the 51st ruler of the longest continuous monarchy...

129
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,950
-第51位君主  -是 我知道 父亲
-...in the history of the world. -Yes,I'm aware,Father.

130
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,956
这种君主制仍要求
It's a monarchy that still requires 

131
00:11:34,957 --> 00:11:35,880
国王参与
the participation of the king

132
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,280
政府的工作和决定
in the workings and decisions of the government.

133
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:41,510
所以我问你是否准备好了
So if I ask you if you're prepared,

134
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,440
这绝不是个无关紧要的问题
it's not an insignificant question.

135
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,980
父亲 我准备好了 好吗
Father,I'm prepared,OK?

136
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,090
国王陛下
His Majesty,the king.

137
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,120
王子殿下
And His Royal Highness,the crown prince.

138
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,050
-陛下  -我很好
-Your Majesty. -I'm all right.

139
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,000
-首相  -陛下
-Prime minister. -Your Royal Highness.

140
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,340
好 女士们先生们 我们开始吧
OK,ladies and gentlemen,let's get started.

141
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,000
但是百分之六的工资增长
But a six-percent pay increase

142
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,360
是全国工会接受的最低水平
is the least the national unions will accept.

143
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,500
-这不合理  -看
-That's unconscionable. -Look.

144
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,788
如果我们不同意 
If we can't agree,

145
00:12:17,789 --> 00:12:19,250
怎么让两方达成一致呢
how are we gonna get the two sides together?

146
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,710

This is blackmail.

147
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,910

All right,we'll have to make other concessions then.

148
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,400

Is there no end to the workers' demands?

149
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,240

Our government must refuse to give in to the unions at all costs.

150
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,080

I appreciate your ardor,Thomas,

151
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:35,010

but I assure you they are very serious about the deadline.

152
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,120

Without concessions,they will strike.

153
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,100

A nationwide strike will be disastrous for our economy.

154
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,720

Edvard,I'm sure we'd all like to know what you think.

155
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,160

Sorry,what was the question? 

156
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,050
I was... I was busy.

157
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,710
I see.

158
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,800
I don't know why my father insists I go with him.

159
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,830
I've always detested those meetings.

160
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,950
Yes,sir.

161
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,550
Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that,

162
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,680
I don't know,you're going to be king someday.

163
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,670
Yes,don't remind me,Soren.

164
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,410
You're very lucky you're not me,let me tell you.

165
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,530
If you want to change places,sir,call me day or night.

166
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,140
You know my mother's gonna go crazy

167
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,270
when she finds out what happened today.

168
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:26,100
It's a speech I definitely don't want to hear.

169
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,170
I need to get out of Denmark,Soren. 

170
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,700
I need to clear my head.

171
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,710
Oh,yes,and where would you like to clear your head this time,sir?

172
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,110
I hear the slopes are opening early in St. Moritz this year.

173
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,380
Monte Carlo has opened a new casino.

174
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,140
Dropping a few hundred thousand kroner always

175
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,590
seems to have worked miracles in the past.

176
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,760
Warning. The following commercial...

177
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,930
Wait,no time for that. Watch this!

178
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,250
For years,Desperate Dan has been talking real women

179
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,230
into doing the most outrageous things.

180
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,210
{\pos(192,210)}纯洁无瑕 马上订购 拨打80055501991

181
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,960
And he's captured it all on tape.

182
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,520
And now Desperate Dan takes you to America's heartland

183
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,140
to bring you Wild College Girls:

184
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,970
The Girls of Wisconsin.

185
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,090
{\pos(192,210)}威斯康星州的

186
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,560
{\pos(192,210)}姑娘们

187
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:07,020
{\pos(192,210)}威斯康星州的姑娘们 马上订购 拨打80055501991

188
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,280
Oh,please. Come on,take your top off for us.

189
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,100
Come on,Just once.

190
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,210
-Wisconsin? -Yes.

191
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,950
Why there,son?

192
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,290
Because I've never spent much time in America before.

193
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:17,300
And I'd rather go to the heart of the country

194
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,990
where I can meet ordinary Americans.

195
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,490
Plus,there's a well-respected university with interesting programs

196
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,710
and a wide variety of extracurricular activities.

197
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,840
But this is absurd.

198
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,540
Look,I see this as a real opportunity to find myself.

199
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,500
Oh,Edvard,please.

200
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:41,260
This is just another in a series of escapades.

201
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,680
Which,by the way,we finance.

202
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,970
Inevitably ending up with you in some tabloid,embarrassing us

203
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,930
and forcing you to come back to the palace to hide yourself

204
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,990
until you convince us you have to go and find yourself yet again.

205
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,870
If I'm the embarrassment you believe me to be,

206
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,130
then maybe you should cut me off.

207
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,460
Well,what are you saying?

208
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,950
I'm saying I want to go and I'm going.

209
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,450
And I neither require your money nor your permission.

210
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:11,500
-Edvard! -I will do this on my own,Mother!

211
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,480
Let him go.

212
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,940
We've tried evertyhing else,and it doesn't work,so...

213
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,710
Frankly,it's encouraging he even wants to try.

214
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,610
Soren. You will go with him.

215
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,720
Me,Your Majesty?

216
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,630
On my own?

217
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,370
Surely there's a caretaker better suited than...

218
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:40,800
I will arrange for our departure.

219
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,670
-Hey! -Slow down.

220
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,640
Just look at them all,Soren.

221
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,340
Thousands upon thousands of young,

222
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,070
crazy college girls getting drunk...

223
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,710
...and taking their tops off every night.

224
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,950
Yes,sir,what a treat for us

225
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,560
that it's happening here in America's dairy land.

226
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:21,250
Breeding ground of the coronary bypass patients of the world.

227
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,900
Look at her.

228
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,700
Your parents are expecting you to attend your classes,

229
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,960
-Your Royal Highness. -Yes,I know.

230
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,150
Listen,Soren.

231
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,420
From this point forward,I do not want you to address me

232
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,040
as the prince or Your Royal Highness.

233
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,720
You will address me as...

234
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,070
Eddie.

235
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,030
Yes,Eddie.

236
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,543
The last thing I need right now 

237
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,950
is to have the press all over me.

238
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,610
I think it's gonna be fun.

239
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,920
I'm having a wonderful time already.

240
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,340
-Are you unhappy,Soren? -What gave me away,sir?

241
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,530
I don't know. Your expression never changes.

242
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,780
-Do you even know how to smile? -Yes.

243
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,080
Oh,Soren,this is us.

244
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,350
Good heavens.

245
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,410
I thought you had to be convicted of a crime

246
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,260
before you lived somewhere like this.

247
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,780
It's not that bad.

248
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,980
Plus,we haven't seen the rest of it yet.

249
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,360
Apparently,this is the rest of it.

250
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,030
Well,I like it.

251
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,200
And I'll even let you have first choice of the beds.

252
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:06,890
Oh,heavens.

253
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,850
Which stained mattress shall I choose?

254
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,560
You the new guys?

255
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,790
I'm Scotty.

256
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,260
All right,all my food's labeled,

257
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,680
so I'll know if you ate anything.

258
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,040
I'm allergic to dairy,shellfish,

259
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,540
red meat,melon,nuts and kiwi.

260
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,930
So don't bring any of that stuff around here.

261
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,800
The Xbox is off-limits.

262
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,730
If you screw up any of my high scores,

263
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,380
I'll blind you with my laser pointer.

264
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,570
Now,this...

265
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,820
This is the real university life I was talking about.

266
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,040
You see,here,we're just two typical college students.

267
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,150
Absolutely,sir.

268
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,670
I,for one,can't wait to raucously cheer on the fellows

269
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,230
of the tackle football team as they challenge the Gophers,

270
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,190
our hated rivals,who apparently hail from a place called Minnesota.

271
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,210
Minnesota sucks! Wisconsin rules!

272
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,820
No,no.

273
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,740
Waitress,we'd like to see some menus,please.

274
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,500
I'm not a waitress,there are no menus,

275
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,500
and the kitchen's closed.

276
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,700
Well,then what can you offer us?

277
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,310
I can offer you beer and pretzel rods,

278
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:57,110
my fine fellow,at ye old pub yonder.

279
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,440
Shall I go to the bar,sir?

280
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,870
Yes. Yes,two of these. Two beers.

281
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,660
Very good.

282
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,060
Would you like another,sir?

283
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:33,050
-Yes,I'll get these. -Thank you very much,sir.

284
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,160
-Hello again. -What can I get for you?

285
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,770
I was hoping you could recommend something better

286
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,420
than what we've been drinking.

287
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,940
Well,for the discerning out-of-towner like yourself,

288
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,700
I recommend Leinenkugel's.

289
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,890
You can really taste the extra 10 cents.

290
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,910
Yes,by all means. Two,please.

291
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,450
You know,if we were in Germany right now,

292
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,800
we'd be underground.

293
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,070
-What? -Rathskeller,it means basement.

294
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,510
OK.

295
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:28,010
Yes,perhaps I should've known better than to flirt in German.

296
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,950
Perhaps.

297
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:33,030
It's not a very attractive language,is it?

298
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,870
No.

299
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,490
-I'm Eddie. -Paige.

300
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:49,350
-So will you take your top off for me? -What?

301
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,450
Take your top off for me like Wild College Girls.

302
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,820
Just a quick look. 

303
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,980
No one's watching. Just take it off for me.

304
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,240
-You,time to go. -Just calm down.

305
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,980
-No,you calm down. -Get off me.

306
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,380
-You get out. -Get your hands off me.

307
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,310
Out. Go on!

308
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,060
Science is a never-ending quest.

309
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,410
For anyone planning a future in science,

310
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,170
an open mind is a must.

311
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,360
Grading is as follows:

312
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,080
Forty percent,procedure.

313
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:31,540
Fifty percent,lab work. And ten...

314
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,500
May I help you?

315
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,310
Yes. I believe I'm signed up for this class.

316
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,850
Fine,Mr. Williams.

317
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,990
Next time be here by 8:20,or you'll be locked out.

318
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:51,030
And what about you? I'm talking to you,sir.

319
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:56,030
-I'm auditing. -Not this class,too small.

320
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,910
Take a seat,Mr. Williams.

321
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,260
As I was saying,forty percent,procedure.

322
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,200
-Fifty percent,lab work. -You can wait outside.

323
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,560
-You'll be all right,sir? -And ten percent...

324
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,550
Yes,just wait outside.

325
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:10,220
You know,if this is a "lovers' thing",

326
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,250
could you please take it in the hall?

327
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,750
Soren,just go. Go.

328
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,970
My sincerest apologies.

329
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,200
Oh,please proceed.

330
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,540
And ten percent,attendance.

331
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:39,980
You will find a list in front of you of your supplies

332
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:43,040
and the experiment you will be conducting.

333
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,680
Now,I want you to turn to the

334
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:48,510
person next to you and introduce yourself.

335
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:49,860
Congratulations,folks,

336
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,920
you've just said hello to your permanent lab partner.

337
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,230
Hey. Hey.

338
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,440
You forgot your supply list.

339
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,550
Oh,right,thank you.

340
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:08,750
-Listen,what's your name again? -Eddie.

341
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:11,540
Eddie. Right. This class is really important to me

342
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,820
because I need this teacher to get me into med school.

343
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,360
And if I'm stuck with you as my partner,

344
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:18,040
I can't afford to have you screw things up for me,OK?

345
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,400
It's very important to me,as well.

346
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,710
I love organic chemistry.

347
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,930
I've recently discovered that large amounts

348
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:28,180
of alcohol mixed with a carbon-based life form 

349
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,290
causes the life form to blurt out stupid things.

350
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,780
So apologies to the other night.

351
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,760
I was just having some fun.

352
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,050
Right.Of course you were.

353
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,860
And I love being made to feel like a brainless slut

354
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,040
by some sloppy lush. Thanks.

355
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,740
I have learned me to repent the sin Of disobedient opposition

356
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,720
To you and your behest,I am enjoined And beg your pardon

357
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,810
Is he drunk now?

358
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,520
It's a play. Romeo and Juliet?

359
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:00,170
Shakespeare?

360
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,380
This is gonna be a fun semester.

361
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:06,050
Don't forget your half of the supplies next time.

362
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,130
I mean you would think that after spraying somebody

363
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:22,990
with high-powered soda,he'd get the message to stay away.

364
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:26,620
Well,I think he's pretty hot.

365
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,810
Hot? Oh,my God,Beth,he is so affected.

366
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,670
He was quoting Shakespeare,

367
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:34,560
like some Shakespearean-duke-lord guy.

368
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,470
I hate phonies like that.

369
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,400
So are you saying you wouldn't take him up to the stacks?

370
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:44,630
OK. A,going at it in the dusty stacks of the library is fairly disgusting.

371
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,870
And B,you literally say that about every hot guy.

372
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,820
Oh,so you admit he's hot.

373
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,310
OK,I'm done having this conversation.

374
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,880
I need to concentrate on my applications.

375
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:01,350
And what's with his weird friend who's always hanging around?

376
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:05,720
One partner is monitoring temperature and flow,

377
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:12,800
while the other pours the hydrochloric acid into the separatory funnel.

378
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,480
Now...

379
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,430
...carefully turn the stopcock

380
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:24,690
to allow some of the solution to flow into the round-bottom flask.

381
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,270
Start over again.

382
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,730
Where is he?

383
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,370
You're still in bed?

384
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,450
Good morning,miss.

385
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,000
Would you care for some breakfast?

386
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,530
I spent the last two hours looking like an incompetent idiot

387
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,390
because my lab partner didn't show up.

388
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,460
-Was that this morning? -Yes!

389
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,850
You know,I know exactly who you are.

390
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:04,740
-You do? -You do?

391
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,080
You're a spoiled,little rich kid 

392
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,530
who sees college as a detour

393
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,260
on the way to an easy life.

394
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,430
No character. No accomplishments.

395
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,460
Just a royal pain in the ass.

396
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,210
You're completely wrong.

397
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,240
See,unlike people who are given evertyhing,

398
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,080
I have to earn what I get.

399
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,680
But that is the beauty of a meritocracy.

400
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,340
People rise and fall based on how hard they work.

401
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,700
Would you like some more hollandaise?

402
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,180
No,that's good. Thank you.

403
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,870
You're making eggs Benedict?

404
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,500
On a hot plate in a dorm room?

405
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,900
Yes,just a typical student breakfast.

406
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,800
Would you care to join us?

407
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,820
No,thank you.

408
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:40,070
-So where's your statue? -What statue?

409
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:43,790
Someone as righteous as you must have a statue of themselves somewhere.

410
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,970
There's a difference between being righteous and being right.

411
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:46,900
I happen to be right.

412
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,220
Could you please put a shirt on or something?

413
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:49,980
If you're going to be a doctor,

414
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:52,680
you'll have to get used to naked men.

415
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:55,840
Dude! Dude,there's a chick in our room.

416
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,370
-Just drop the class. -No.

417
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,100
Well,then you better be there,

418
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,350
and you better be prepared.

419
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,430
She really meant those things,didn't she?

420
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:15,060
Yes,she did seem rather upset,sir.

421
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:19,370
Though,regardless,I don't see why you would care.

422
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,480
Do enjoy the eggs,sir.

423
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,720
They were purchased with the last of your money.

424
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:24,980
We have some left,don't we?

425
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,660
What you came with is gone.

426
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,530
Well,you're getting some sort of paycheck,aren't you?

427
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:36,940
Hey,you cheap Swede.

428
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,930
"Skills: polo,fencing,speak French,English,German,Dutch,

429
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,240
"Danish and Flemish".

430
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,580
Flemish? Is there a country called Flem?

431
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,910
Look,that's all great,but it doesn't mean crap to me.

432
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,790
I need somebody with work experience,and you don't have any.

433
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:57,470
I really could do with the employment.

434
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,720
There are a lot of students who wanna work here.

435
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,560
Well,I have the highest recommendation.

436
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,550
-Hey,Paige. -Hi.

437
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,070
Are you deliberately trying to make me miserable?

438
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,600
No,I'm simply manning the delicatessen in the event

439
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:22,600
that one of my fellow students wants a tasty sandwich.

440
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,960
Stu,did you hire this guy?

441
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,620
Yeah. He came highly recommended.

442
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:27,930
-By whom? -You.

443
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,710
-What would you like? -A turkey sandwich.

444
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,680
Paige,I'm busy. Eddie's your boy.

445
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,170
You're in charge of him.

446
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:37,050
All right,it seems we're completely out of turkey today.

447
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:40,290
Dude,there's like ten turkey things in there.

448
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,980
Is this some sort of test?

449
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:47,210
Did Johns Hopkins send you to see if I can handle pressure?

450
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,120
Because I'm starting to crack.

451
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,700
Well,who's in charge of carving?

452
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,470
-Use the slicer. -What's that?

453
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,130
You used me as a reference.

454
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,090
Yes. Look,you were the only one I knew.

455
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,060
Despite what you think,I do need this job. 

456
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,330
I have no money.

457
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:06,210
But you have a personal egg poacher.

458
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:08,580
No,no. He's just another student.

459
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,170
Really? What's he studying? How to be a 30-year-old junior?

460
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,850
Try the "on" button.

461
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,760
Look,Paige. 

462
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,340
You were right about my parents back in Denmark.

463
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:22,540
They are from a certain wealth.

464
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,120
But I've cut myself off from them.

465
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,610
Dude.

466
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,570
Yes,just one minute.

467
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,710
Listen,Paige. 

468
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,400
I realize I've taken advantage of you recently,and...

469
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,740
But just give me a chance today,

470
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,780
and if I cause any problems,then I'll quit.

471
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,380
OK. Your right hand goes on the handle.

472
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,450
Slowly slide the meat back and forth.

473
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,250
And unless you want a turkey-thumb sandwich,

474
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,560
don't put your hand near the blade when it's moving,OK?

475
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:54,840
Right.

476
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,700
OK.

477
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,970
-Slowly,slowly. -Right.

478
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:09,950
Right.

479
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,560
OK,nice and smooth.

480
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,460
That's enough.

481
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:38,020
-Here,Paige,it's your turn tonight. -OK.

482
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,720
Hey,kid.

483
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:00,190
I need you to go outside and hose down the mats.

484
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,800
Are you sure you don't want a hand,sir?

485
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,320
-No,I'm fine. -Good night.

486
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,990
Hey.

487
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,430
You did OK in there.

488
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,210
-You can't be serious,can you? -Well,by "OK",I mean

489
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:33,250
spilling a ton of beer and screwing up everyone's order.

490
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,100
-Yeah. -No,you'll be fine.

491
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,120
You know,this Saturday evening,

492
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,130
there's a dorm party at Brenner Hall.

493
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,740
A gathering.

494
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:54,620
I was wondering if you would like to accompany me.

495
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,690
Accompany you?

496
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:59,320
Oh,right,yes. How do you say it colloquially?

497
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:03,400
Yo,dog,there's a mad party kicking at my crib,

498
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,230
if you want to roll down there with me.

499
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,950
That was just sad. Don't ever do that again.

500
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,070
Yes,I really hurt my finger.

501
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:16,040
So would you like to come?

502
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:21,670
I...

503
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,840
I'm actually kind of busy.

504
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,410
Oh,dear.

505
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,760
-What? -I believe you just got rejected,sir.

506
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:40,380
You know,I don't think that's ever happened to me before.

507
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,650
You've never been attracted to anyone

508
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:44,440
who didn't know you were a prince before.

509
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,750
I wouldn't get too worked up over it,sir.

510
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:49,330
The chances of a relationship between yourself

511
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:52,100
and Miss Paige are not promising.

512
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:55,030
You two are of a completely different caliber.

513
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:56,990
Soren,just because she isn't royalty 

514
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,040
doesn't mean she's not important.

515
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:04,000
The higher caliber I was referring to,sir,was hers.

516
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,970
What?

517
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,140
Miss.

518
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:23,070
You really must get some rest,Your Majesty.

519
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,840
I'm relieved there wasn't more to it than this.

520
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:28,160
There'll be more of these tests,yes?

521
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,610
I can't say for sure.

522
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:32,090
-There'll be several tests? -There might be.

523
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,200
Will this take many days? 

524
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,600
No,I'm pretty sure we can get them out of the way. 

525
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,810
Thank you,doctor.

526
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:38,930
I don't think you need to go to this.

527
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:41,220
I promised I'd go.

528
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,500
Are you feeling ill,Daddy?

529
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,510
There's nothing to worry about,my darling.

530
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:52,260
Yes,Arabella.

531
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,800
You shouldn't worry.

532
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,700
Just a little flu.

533
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,400
Excuse me,ma'am. 

534

It's time for His Majesty to be going.

535
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,410
Sweetie.

536
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,840
So,what would you like to do today?

537
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:08,790
-Horse riding. -Good idea.

538
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,940

please do something.

So you know the other day when you quoted Romeo and Juliet?

-Yes. -Well,it's funny

because I'm actually taking a Shakespeare class myself and...

...I'm not struggling,I'm actually being graded unfairly.

550
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:03,310

Well-versed.

552
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:09,100
Yeah. Well,I was hoping maybe you could...

553
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,830
Help you.

554
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,350
-No,I don't need help. -Oh,OK.

555
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,350
Just sounded like you were asking me for help,that's all.

556
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,340
Forget it.

557
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,740
Yeah,OK,I need help.

558
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,270
Yes,I'll help you. It's not a problem.

559
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,890
Only...

560
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:32,940
...I'm going to need some help of my own first.

561

Pour the bleach like this:

562
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:39,150
And do not spill.

00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,210
I bet you can't believe I've never done laundry,can you?

564
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,520
Yeah,it's a real leap.

565
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,150

Cold,cold.

568
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,170
It's just so confusing.

569
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:06,580
I mean,how do you know what goes in which pile?

570
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:10,200
It's a gift. I guess you could say I'm the Rain Man of laundry.

571
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,950
OK,now it's my turn.

572
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:21,060
We did King Lear,and now we're on the Sonnets.

573
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,880
Next,it's Hamlet,which is about a whiny prince from Denmark.

574
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,750
What does that have to do with reality?

575
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,100
More than you think.

576
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,380
Well,you're from Denmark,do you even have princes?

577
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,930
Yes,I think we do.

578
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,240
Well,Beth read it,and she said he's a total loser.

579
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,490
Well,you can tell Beth that the prince was young and scared,

580
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:40,320
and he didn't feel ready for the hard choices he had to make.

581
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,760
It's not easy facing that kind of pressure.

582
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,000
Right. Sonnets,you say.

Which have no correspondence With true sight

586
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,860
Or if they have Where is my Judgment fled

587
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,270
That censures falsely What they see aright?

588
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,360

591
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,750
Well,he's saying that love is magical,

592
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,880
and that it makes people look at each other

593

in an unspoiled way,without judgment.

594
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,130
Why doesn't he just say that?

595
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,280
Why can't people just say what they mean?

596
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:35,080
Well,people rarely say what they mean.

That's the interesting part,is...

598
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,270
...is what's going on underneath the surface.

599
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,540
See,take line 12.

600
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:48,660
The sun itself sees not Till heaven clears

601
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,680
What does that mean to you?

602
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:54,700
That the sun can't shine when it's cloudy.

603
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,840
No. You're being too literal.

604
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,500
See,don't just go for the obvious.

605
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,230
See,all these words,they have multiple meanings,

606
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:03,090
and you have to explore the possibilities 

607
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,890
and then make your choice.

608
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:09,380
See,like the word "sun",that could mean the actual sun,

609
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,720
or it can mean light.

610
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,040
But then "light" can mean knowledge or reason.

611
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,130
That could go on forever.

612
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,640
Yes. Yes,it could.

613
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:21,630
But I think in this case it means reason.

614
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:25,640
And then "heaven" may refer to the pearly gates,

615
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:28,140
or it could mean a state of being,you know,

616
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:32,460
Iike being happy or in love.

617
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:37,880
So now read it again,taking in all the possibilities,

618
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,830
and tell me what you think it means.

619
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:47,390
The sun itself sees not Till heaven clears

620
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:57,160
I guess it means that love blinds you.

621
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,240
And when you're in love,you can't think reasonably.

622
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,220
Do you agree?

623
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,840
Yeah.

624
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:14,990
I mean,it's just a poem.

625
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,030
Yeah. Yeah,it's just a poem.

626
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,860
Are you worried a union work stoppage

627
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,860
will throw the country into a recession?

628
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,410
That's something we're striving to avoid.

629
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,360
Mr. Prime Minister.

630
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,030
Do you think being part of the EU

631
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:29,270
has been good for Denmark?

632
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,050
The United States of Europe is a question of being strong together.

633
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,970
It's another boring photo opportunity

634
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,690
of an old guy walking down a carpet

635
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,820
answering the same questions he answered last week.

636
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,630
-Where's Edvard? -Now,you see,

637
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:43,000
he was always good for a big disaster every few months or so.

638
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,840
I've got to find him.

639
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,590
Eddie. Hey.

640
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,330
Look. It's my Shakespeare midterm.

641
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,600
A-minus.

642
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,670
That's brilliant. That's really,really good.

643
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:02,300
-Well done. -Thank you.

644
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,250
-Thank you,really,for helping me. -It's OK.

645
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,090
I did even better on my chemistry.

646
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,280
It's good. That's really good.

647
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:16,380
-How'd you do? -How did I do?

648
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:19,020
A minus...

649
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,000
-...three grades. -D-minus.

650
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:23,070
Yes,but it doesn't matter.

651
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,970
Sure it does. You can do better.

652
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:26,190
I know you can.

653
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:33,980
And give up a brilliant career in the food-service industry?

654
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,760
Hey,Eddie,do you have any plans for Thanksgiving?

655
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:51,070
No,no. I'll be here.

656
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,420
Have a good vacation.

657
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:58,280
Yes,you too.

658
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:00,260
{\pos(192,210)}感恩节去马尼托瓦克 请致电保罗・布伦纳・霍尔

659
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,370
I can't believe you. I can't believe you,Paige.

660
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:03,360
You should've invited him home with you.

661
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,740
What? No. That would be so weird.

662
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,050
Well,then you won't mind

663
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,980
if I invite him back to Milwaukee with me?

664
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:15,420
No. No,of course not. Why would I mind?

665
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:17,300
I don't know.

666
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,510
Hey,Eddie,since you don't have any other plans,

667
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:22,690
I was wondering if...

668
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,620
You wanted to spend Thanksgiving with me and my family?

669
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:31,350
Yes,that'd be nice.

670
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:13,160
-Thank you. -Sure.

671
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:13,160
I think I probably should come with you,sir.

672
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:13,160
Oh,no,not this time.

673
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:13,160
The thing is,you see,you'll be on your own.

674
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:13,160
-Yes,and I'll manage. -All right. Later,dudes.

675
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:50,450
Actually,sir,it's my duty to look out for you at all times.

676
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,320
-Soren,I'll be fine. -With respect,sir,

677
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,950
that's not for you to decide.

678
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,010
Soren,yes,it is for me to decide.

679
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,130
What am I going to do here for five days?

680
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,440
I don't know. Just sightsee,relax.

681
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,930
Soren,you'll be fine,OK?

682
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:21,450
-I'll pick you up Monday. -Thanks again.

683
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:29,250
-Thank you. -Hey.

684
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:31,870
Hiya,sweetie. Oh,it's good to have you home.

685
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:33,750
-Hi,Dad. -Hi,kiddo.

686
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:37,060
This is Eddie. Eddie,this is my mom and dad.

687
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,060
Oh,we're so glad that you could join us.

688
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:42,300
The only college friends of Paige's we've ever met,

689
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:43,330
they've all been girls.

690
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:45,930
-Thank you. I'm glad to be invited. -Hi,I'm Ben Morgan.

691
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,460
Ben,hello.

692
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:49,940
Hey,hey,Doc Paige.

693
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:53,080
Farmer John Sausage.

694
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:55,840
-Hey. -Hey. Oh,Mike,you look great.

695
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:59,250
Oh,well,you know,Kayla's got me on Slim-Fast,so I lost 15.

696
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,770
And he put five of it back on today at Rocky Rococo's.

697
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:03,960
Boys.

698
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:06,780
Who's this guy?

699
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:09,530
This is Eddie. Eddie's an exchange student from Denmark.

700
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:11,550
-He's just a friend. -Hello.

701
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:15,290
-Welcome to our home. -Thank you.

702
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:18,120
Mike,he speaks better English than you do.

703
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,450
Yeah,anyway...

704
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,060
Pops,we'll see you in the morning.

705
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,040
Hey,we're watching you,Frenchy.

706
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,270
Come on into the house.

707
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:31,040
-You can ignore the moron twins. -OK.

708
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:35,830
This is it.

709
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:40,070
-Oh,you can put them right here. -Right.

710
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,750
Thanks.

711
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:10,050
What are all the pins for?

712
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,380
The few red ones are where I've been,

713
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,510
and all the green ones are where I want to go.

714
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:17,950
Ecuador,El Salvador.

715
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,460
They're not exactly tourist destinations,are they?

716
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:24,270
No,but they're all the places that Doctors Without Borders

717
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:27,130
brings good medical care and vaccinations

718
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:29,490
and clean drinking water. What?

719
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:31,170
Nothing.

720
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:35,000
I just really never met someone who makes me feel so intimidated.

721
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:39,020
And believe me,I've met my fair share of intimidating people.

722
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:41,620
I'm not intimidating. Look at me.

723
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:45,240
Yes,well,you see,that's pretty intimidating,as well.

724
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,690
Well,I'm not the only one with goals.

725
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:50,470
What do you want to do?

726
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:51,750
I don't really have any choice.

727
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:55,440
I have to take over the family business.

728
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:58,560
-No choice at all? -No.

729
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,260
Careful,you're crushing Gus.

730
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,880
Oh,Gus.

731
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,470
Yes,Gus. He's a very good watch-moose.

732
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,570
Not once was I attacked by a monster under my bed

733
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:11,010
or something scary in the closet.

734
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:11,970
Isn't that right,Gus?

735
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:14,140
Yes,that's right.

736
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,160
Hello,Gus. Nice to meet you.

737
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,140
Very pleased to meet you,as well.

738
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:25,870
-I like you like this. -Like what?

739
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:29,810
Don't know. Just like this.

740
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:32,200
Just Paige.

741
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:36,920
All right,Eddie,we got John's room made up for you.

742
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:39,230
It's just down the hall across from our room.

743
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:44,230
-We sleep with the door open. -Thanks,Dad.

744
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:46,760
So,Eddie,would you like to see how things work around here?

745
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,590
Maybe help us out tomorrow?

746
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:50,980
No,no,I don't think that's such a good idea.

747
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:54,620
-Oh,why not? -Yes,why not?

748
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:58,090
OK. You know what? Go ahead and help out.

749
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:00,190
I'm gonna enjoy this.

750
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:02,430
Come on,let's get you settled in.

751
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:10,640
Stop. Stop.

752
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:48,380
This one nearly hit me.

753
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:51,150
-Haven't seen too many tractors,huh? -That's right.

754
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,180
Nicely done with the milking.

755
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:55,970
Yeah,I think you got a new best friend in Bessy.

756
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,780
-Hey,should we get some dinner? -What are those?

757
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:04,630
-They're lawn mowers. -Lawn mowers. Really?

758
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,390
Yeah.

759
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:09,220
Hey,hey.

760
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:11,310
Actually,we race these. 

761
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:13,100
It's a huge sport around here.

762
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:14,550
Really?

763
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,150
-Yeah. -Do you mind if I have a look?

764
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:19,250
No,be our guest.

765
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:22,080
Take a look at this one. This is my baby.

766
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:23,650
Right.

767
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:36,570
-I just put a new flywheel in there. -Yes,I see.

768
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:38,610
You know,no matter how dirty he races,

769
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:40,200
there's no way we're letting Keith Kopetsky 

770
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:41,750
take the trophy again this year.

771
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,280
How fast do these things go?

772
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:45,710
Well,we clocked it at 52.

773
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:50,360
I can make it faster.

774
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,030
-Yeah. -OK. Come on. Let's go.

775
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,930
-What? -That's good.

776
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:58,260
Oh,you don't believe me? I can.

777
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,790
-Might be a Thanksgiving pa,huh? -Yeah.

778
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,440
Are you OK?

779
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:08,970
-Oh,you had me going. -Not until after the pie,all right?

780
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:12,520
-Milk? -Oh,no.

781
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:15,100
I won't be drinking much milk in the near future.

782
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,850
-Ma,great turkey. -Don't eat too much.

783
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:19,640
We got feeding to do later,

784
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,840
and I don't need you boys in a turkey coma.

785
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:24,260
-All right. -You've got more work?

786
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,370
-Yeah,24 hours a day. -Really?

787
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,210
-Have to. -If you don't milk them,

788
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,330
the cows' udders will explode.

789
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:34,640
-No. -It happened at Frank Monahan's.

790
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:36,370
And did you actually see it happen,Mikey?

791
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,620
-No. -You're so bad.

792
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:39,390
You see,Eddie,we gotta work twice as hard 

793
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:41,070
as corporate-owned farms

794
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:42,690
just to stay afloat.

795
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:45,350
At this rate,the family farm will be extinct in 20 years.

796
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:47,070
I don't think he needs to hear it now.

797
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,380
No,I'm interested.

798
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,540
What the big boys need to understand

799
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:51,710
is that we're all interdependent.

800
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:54,810
And if somebody loses,eventually,we'll all lose.

801
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,630
-What? -Nothing.

802
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:02,190
-Thanks,Dad. -So,Eddie,

803
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:05,180
-what's up with you and my sister? -Johnny!

804
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:07,640
Look,Paige,someone had to ask.

805
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:09,380
Yeah,Paige,he's too good-looking.

806
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,700
-Yeah. -That's right,you're too good-looking.

807
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:14,070
-I'm not that good-looking. -He's pretty good-looking.

808
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:15,920
-You're pretty good-looking. -Oh,yeah.

809
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:18,490
-Guys. -If you combine that with the accent

810
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:20,720
and your Euro-charm,you're a lethal combination.

811
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:22,120
Would everyone just stop? Please.

812
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,510
Paige,we don't even know this guy.

813
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,150
I don't know anyone from Denmark.

814
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:27,490
I've never heard of anyone from there.

815
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:30,290
-Have you? -Yeah,sure.

816
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,570
Eddie?

817
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:40,850
Kierkegaard,Niels Bohr,Hans Christian Andersen.

818
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,380
Wow.

819
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:46,030
Hans Christian Andersen?

820
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:48,650
Lars Ulrich.

821
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:50,350
-From Metallica? -From Metallica.

822
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:51,550
-Get out. -OK.

823
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,230
-And Helena Christensen. -Whoa,whoa,wait a second.

824
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,260
-The Victoria's Secret model? -Yes.

825
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:59,340
-OK. -That's gotta be the coolest country

826
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:02,230
-in the world now. -You should be a superpower.

827
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:03,760
Yes.

828
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:13,530
{\pos(192,210)}收割机 准备

829
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:07,930
Welcome,ladies and gentlemen,

830
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:10,280
to the Manitowoc County Fairgrounds.

831
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:16,110
A beautiful day for racing and the 10th annual Mad Mower Derby.

832
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:18,210
Give them a hand. We got the seniors' class.

833
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:21,240
We've got machines up to 15 horsepower.

834
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,890
They'll be blasting by the grandstand here

835
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:24,610
at a good eight to 12 miles an hour.

836
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:27,260
So hang on to your hats when they come by,folks.

837
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:29,840
Let them hear it when they come past the stands here.

838
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,670
Peterson's coming out of the pit.

839
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:33,940
Look at him go around that corner.

840
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:36,390
-Come on. Come on. -We've got a big deal today.

841
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:39,610
Check it out. Kopetsky.

842
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:49,950
What's up,Keith?

843
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,850
What the hell did you do to that thing?

844
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,090
I bumped up the compression 

845
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,300
and a few other little modifications.

846
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:07,730
All right. One lap to go,folks.

847
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:08,990
Let them hear it now.

848
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:11,960
The last of the five laps here in the senior class.

849
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:15,680
Osterhouse is pushing. Now Peterson's moving up.

850
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:17,470
He's making his move.He's making his move.  

851
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:18,650
He comes out right in here.

852
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,460
And here comes Thompson. There goes Peterson!

853
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:23,490
Go,Mr. Peterson.

854
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,740
-That's Mr. Peterson? -He's so damn old.

855
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:30,750
What a good,clean race we had for the seniors.

856
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:35,260
-Your brothers seem to like him. -Mom.

857
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:38,020
-I like him too. -Yeah,I get that.

858
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,700
I really can't afford any distractions right now.

859
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:46,140
Chemistry isn't just in a class,kiddo.

860
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:49,750
-And you guys have it. -Right.

861
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:50,370
Then what happens?

862
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:52,930
I fool myself into thinking he's Prince Charming?

863
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,190
We get married and live happily ever after?

864
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,310
Then all my work goes down the drain

865
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:59,630
because I'm too busy shopping for groceries

866
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:01,640
and picking my kids up at soccer.

867
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,690
Sweetie,

868
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:07,670
it really wasn't as bad as all that.

869
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:11,320
-I didn't mean it that way. -I know.

870
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:13,250
But we're not talking about me.

871
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:16,310
I made my choice.

872
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:20,330
This is about you making the right choice for you.

873
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,840
OK,we're getting ready for the super-modified class.

874
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:26,880
OK,your brothers are getting out there.

875
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:29,110
We have a Le Mans-style start.

876
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:32,250
The engines will be off. The drivers,on the gun,

877
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:35,110
will be running on foot across the track,

878
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:35,650
-Go,Eddie. -onto the mowers,

879
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:38,640
start the mowers and start racing.

880
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:42,020
All right,this one's for all the marbles.

881
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:45,040
And they've set themselves up on the line now.

882
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,840
Boys,you've been waiting all summer for this.

883
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:47,880
They're getting ready here. 

884
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:49,560
They're champing at the bit,folks.

885
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:53,900
All set. Listen for the gun to start it off.

886
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,250
-Shut up. -And they're off. There they go.

887
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,680
-Oh,Williams and Kopetsky collide. -Get up.

888
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:00,790
Williams is on the ground.

889
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,120
Get out of there before they run you over.

890
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,230
They're firing the machines up now. Number five is up.

891
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,640
Number seven's up. Kopetsky pulls right out.

892
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:14,160
Looks like Williams is having trouble getting his engine going.

893
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:15,660
And as they head into the first turn,

894
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:18,530
Kopetsky on number eight is in the lead.

895
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:24,330
Look at that. Williams got it running.

896
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,430
But he's got a long way to go.

897
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:29,180
Go,go,go!

898
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:32,530
It looks like the Morgan brothers are really challenging Kopetsky there.

899
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,060
They are chasing him down...

900
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:37,070
-Ride my tail. -Mike Morgan,on Moovover,second.

901
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,610
And his brother,John,on number seven,is right behind him.

902
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,860
Williams now is on the track,he's catching up.

903
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:45,490
At the back of the pack,he's starting to move up nicely.

904
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:48,790
And he's putting on some real speed,but he is way behind.

905
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:59,680
And it looks like we've got a duel shaping up in the front of the pack.

906
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:02,620
Mike Morgan is really going after Kopetsky.

907
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:05,790
-Eat it,Morgan! -Watch it!

908
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:08,100
He's pushed Morgan towards the hay bale there.

909
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:10,810
It looks like he pushed him right off the track.

910
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:14,380
-Damn it! God! -Keep it clean there,Kopetsky.

911
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:16,060
John Morgan is moving up now

912
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:18,570
to see if he can snatch the lead away from Kopetsky.

913
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,030
-Come on,Eddie! -Go!

914
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:25,340
And here comes Williams on number nine.

915
00:56:25,490 --> 00:56:28,820
He's catching up. This could be a three-way race,folks.

916
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:30,770
-Go,go,go! -Get him!

917
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:33,690
Kopetsky is trying to hold him off now.

918
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:35,480
Weaving back and forth to the inside.

919
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:38,540
Williams trying to go outside,now trying to cut inside.

920
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:40,060
Kopetsky will have none of it.

921
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:42,650
He's holding him off. One lap to go.

922
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:45,270
Let them hear it,folks. Going around the third corner...

923
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,380
Go! Go! Go!

924
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:49,900
Williams,the rookie,is really out for the gold.

925
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,350
He's coming after Kopetsky on the inside.

926
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,410
Kopetsky is trying to hold him off with some quick moves.

927
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:58,410
Watch out for him,Williams. He'll mess with you.

928
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:04,080
It's Kopetsky and Williams now.

929
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:07,100
Oh,my God,they bumped! Did you see that?

930
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:10,310
Williams is coming in first!

931
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:12,320
Williams,the first-time rookie rider,

932
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:15,900
takes the championship of the super-modifieds.

933
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:17,910
Skoal!

934
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:21,260
That's great.

935
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:25,250
-It's stupid. -He said it was for all the marbles.

936
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,920
-I won them. I'm going to keep them. -Hey,you.

937
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:29,270
Fine race,sir.

938
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:31,200
Hey!

939
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,780
Right.

940
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:38,350
-I'm gonna kick your ass. -Just try.

941
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:42,470
Mike.

942
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:46,220
-Hey,you guys. John,stop. -You couldn't get me,Kopetsky.

943
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:49,460
-Get off me. -Get off.

944
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:11,070
-Are you OK? -Yes.

945
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,320
Here,come over here.

946
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,360
I still think we should've stopped at that biker bar,

947
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:29,960
shown them your hog.

948
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,760
Why?

949
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:33,970
Are we trying to set some record of

950
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:36,660
how many times I can get beaten up in one night?

951
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:41,390
If we were fencing,he would've been in serious trouble.

952
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,860
He still would have punched you.

953
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,750
Sorry.

954
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:51,120
I think that people around here

955
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:54,800
are getting the wrong idea about you and me.

956
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,260
What idea is that?

957
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:03,670
That we're involved.

958
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:09,090
Which we're not.

959
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,160
No.

960
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:13,430
Definitely not.

961
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:16,310
Because you hate me.

962
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:20,250
Yes,very much.

963
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:36,100
What? What's wrong?

964
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:40,260
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

965
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:47,060
Which is why I am going to walk you to your door...

966
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,480
...and bid you good night.

967
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:17,350
He's been like this since I got here yesterday.

968
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:22,450
-Give it back! -Back off,Clearasil!

969
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:47,670
-Stop. -You stop.

970
01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:50,220
I'm studying.

971
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,010
Eddie,finals are coming up. You need to be serious.

972
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,290
I am serious. OK,I will study.

973
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,190
OK. I am. I am.

974
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,800
Study.

No. Stop.

977
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:35,800
God,I've read the same sentence 15 times.

978
01:02:57,910 --> 01:03:00,050
Come with me.

979
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:47,060
-Oh,my God! -Your Highness,

-is she your new girlfriend? -Go! Go!

-What's her name? -This is great!

982
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:52,490
Prince Edvard,is this what you've been doing with your time?

983
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,130
Here! This way!

984
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:55,300
-Come on,hurry! -Prince Edvard!

985
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,760
-Hurry,hurry! -Over here!

986
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:00,940
Stop! Stop! Your Highness!

987
01:04:01,090 --> 01:04:02,240
Prince Edvard,look over here!

988
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:04,030
-Prince Edvard! -What is up?

989
01:04:04,990 --> 01:04:06,920
-Go down the stairs. -OK,OK.

990
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:09,070
-Over here,Prince Edvard! -This way!

991
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,860
-What's her name? -Hurry!

992
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:13,180
I think we have it.

993
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:19,420
What the hell was that?

994
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,250
Why were they calling you Prince Edvard?

995
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:22,760
Because that's my name.

996
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,490
What? That's crazy!

997
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:27,140
You're a prince and that's why they were taking photos of us?

998
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,520
Yes.

999
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:32,660
Are there a lot of princes where you're from,

1000
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:35,700
or are you kind of it?

1001
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,800
I'm it.

1002
01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:41,330
Look.You must be freezing. Let's get you... 

1003
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,330
You lied to me!

1004
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:44,430
No,I didn't lie to you.

1005
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:48,270
I just didn't want to be Prince Edvard for once in my life.

1006
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:50,520
I never should have started this.

1007
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:54,080
You are exactly the kind of distraction I was trying to avoid.

1008
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,620
Are those pictures gonna be in the newspaper?

1009
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:00,610
-Yes. Lots of them. -Are you sure?

1010
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,970
Yes. This isn't my first indiscretion.

1011
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:06,790
I'm... I'm sorry.

1012
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:09,060
-Paige,wait. -Stay away from me.

1013
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,220
-I love you. -You love me?

1014
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:13,580
Why should I believe that?

1015
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:16,160
-You were just pretending. -No,I wasn't pretending.

1016
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:18,610
No,I wasn't pretending!

1017
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:13,910
Outside! I said,outside!

1018
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:18,200
-Outside! -Right over here.

1019
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,760
-I will not tell you again! -I'm so sorry.

1020

Eddie,I think this may be for you.

1025
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:15,130
-Hello? -Soren,put Edvard on the line.

1026
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:16,850
One moment,Your Majesty.

1027
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:20,690
Hello?

1028
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:22,910
-Edvard. -Hello,Mother.

1029
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:26,010
Edvard,you have to come home now.

1030
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:28,660
For your father's sake.

1031
01:07:28,830 --> 01:07:30,790
He's very ill.

1032
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:32,760
Lady Macbeth may have convinced him to kill Duncan,

1033
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:35,400
but he knew it was his fate long before she even tried.

1034
01:07:35,530 --> 01:07:37,620
Destiny is not something that you can fight against.

1035
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:38,810
But what about circumstance? 

1036
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:40,680
Take Othello,for instance.

1037
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:42,520
Was Othello fated to kill Desdemona,

1038
01:07:42,670 --> 01:07:45,660
or did lago create the circumstance?

1039
01:07:46,310 --> 01:07:49,260
I think it's both. On the surface,lago is the bad guy.

1040
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:52,530
But if we look closer,we see that the crack lago exploited

1041
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:54,060
was of Othello's own making.

1042
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:56,640
But still,Othello made choices.

1043
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:58,150
Bad ones.

1044
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:01,890
Othello had love,but he chose not to listen to his heart.

1045
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:04,170
Love doesn't come around every day,and when it does,

1046
01:08:04,290 --> 01:08:06,650
you gotta grab it and hold on.

1047
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:11,230
I mean,they could've lived happily ever after.

1048
01:08:11,390 --> 01:08:14,090
I know that that's a corny schoolgirl fantasy...

1049
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:19,260
...but what if the fantasy actually became true and...

1050
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,630
What if there really is a handsome prince?

1051
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:26,580
-Miss Morgan... -But he's a really good kisser.

1052
01:08:26,730 --> 01:08:28,820
And...

1053
01:08:28,990 --> 01:08:31,470
-What if you just know you're in love? -Miss Morgan...

1054
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:34,130
And all the things you thought were important don't matter anymore,

1055
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:36,670
because the most important thing is to be with him.

1056
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,640
-Miss Morgan. -Then it's not some silly fantasy.

1057
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:42,290
It's actually real.

1058
01:08:42,430 --> 01:08:46,090
I mean,don't you think those two people should be together?

1059
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,730
-Yes. -Yes.

1060
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:49,930
Yes.

1061
01:08:50,070 --> 01:08:52,250
I do too.

1062
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:11,680

1063

1064
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:17,840
He left after his last final.

1065
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:24,090
Someone dropped that off for you.

1066
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:46,040
-Where are you going? -Denmark.

1067
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:48,210
-Why? -It's in the note.

1069
01:09:55,330 --> 01:09:57,290
Still not really getting it here,Paige.

1070
01:09:57,410 --> 01:09:59,800
You've got to look underneath the surface.

1071
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:04,190
So you're just gonna show up at some castle in Denmark,

1072
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:05,750
knock on the door and ask for Eddie?

1073
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:06,900
I don't know what I'm going to do.

1074
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:08,470
I've never felt this way before. 

1075
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:10,710
My stomach is all in knots.

1076
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,190
Sounds like you're in love.

1077
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,950
I'm not thinking like a sane person right now.

1078
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:15,860
I just know that if I don't see him,

1079
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:18,000
I'll spend the rest of my life wondering.

1099
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:06,620
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1100
01:12:07,870 --> 01:12:09,810
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1101
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:12,240
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1102
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:13,980
Excuse me.

1103
01:12:14,090 --> 01:12:15,540
Excuse me.

1104
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:21,690
Long live the queen!

1105
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:24,130
丹麦语

1106
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,330
Eddie!

1107
01:12:27,070 --> 01:12:28,280
丹麦语

1108
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:29,650
Eddie!

1109
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:32,730
Eddie!

1110
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:37,440
Eddie! Eddie!

1111
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:39,110
Eddie!

1112
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:45,390
Eddie! Eddie!

1113
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:47,560
-It's Paige Morgan! -Paige Morgan?

1114
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:49,470
-Paige Morgan? -Paige Morgan.

1115
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:52,560
Look,there's Paige Morgan from the newspaper!

1116
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,780
Hi.

1117
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:59,750
-Paige! Paige! Paige! Paige! -Eddie,it's Paige Morgan!

1118
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:01,240
Paige Morgan!

1119
01:13:03,910 --> 01:13:05,430
Paige Morgan!

1120
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:09,080
Eddie! Eddie!

1121
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:26,600
His Royal Highness,the crown prince,and a guest.

1122
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,950
-Just wait here. -OK.

1123
01:14:39,010 --> 01:14:40,510
Hi.

1124
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:49,850
I now proclaim this session of Parliament open.

1125
01:14:52,930 --> 01:14:54,540
Let's go.

1126
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:04,120
-Oh,no. -What?

1127
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,450
You didn't tell me you lived with your parents.

1128
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:27,020
-Hi. -My word.

1129
01:15:27,170 --> 01:15:29,420
-Miss Paige. -Soren!

1130
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:32,080
Oh,hugging the help?

1131
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:34,240
You're going to fit in very well around here.

1132
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:36,470
Right. I will see you in a moment.

1133
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:40,170
And Soren will show you where to go.

1134
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:47,800
-May I? -Absolutely.

1135
01:15:47,970 --> 01:15:49,650
My pleasure.

1136
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:54,290
This is the south courtyard.

1137
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:57,450
You,of course,came through the private gate.

1138
01:15:57,610 --> 01:16:00,250
-Hi. -Miss Paige.

1139
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:02,700
Right. Hi.

1140
01:16:02,890 --> 01:16:04,530
This is where we keep the mops.

1141
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:06,440
-Absolutely not! -I love her and she loves me.

1142
01:16:06,570 --> 01:16:08,540
-And we will do as we please. -Oh,love.

1143
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:10,890
And when has it ever been about that?

1144
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:12,840
It has taken us a lot to get where we are today.

1145
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:14,380
All we want is the chance to be together.

1146
01:16:14,510 --> 01:16:17,230
It has taken you a lot to get to where you are?

1147
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:21,550
It has taken us 1200 years to get to where we are.

1148
01:16:21,690 --> 01:16:23,950
In a few weeks' time,you will ascend the throne as king,

1149
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:26,850
and I will let nothing stand in the way of that.

1150
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:29,690
Certainly not some tawdry little affair

1151
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:31,330
with a gold-digging American girl

1152
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:34,440
who dreams of becoming the next Princess Di.

1153
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:37,520
Mother,you cannot tell me whom to love and how to live my life.

1154
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:42,560
Edvard,I am sure she has outstanding qualities.

1155
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:46,550
But once the news of your father's illness becomes public,

1156
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:49,070
the people will require reassurance.

1157
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:51,830
Yes,and I will proudly and confidently ascend the throne.

1158
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:53,640
-Good. -As soon as you allow me

1159
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,400
to choose my own bride.

1160
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:57,370
Out of the question.

1161
01:16:57,530 --> 01:16:59,420
She is a commoner.

1162
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,790
Well,then I hope you think that Arabella 

1163
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:04,960
is fit to be the queen at the age of 12.

1164
01:17:05,130 --> 01:17:07,580
Oh,no,I'm forgetting.I'm forgetting about Nestor.

1165
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:08,840
Oh,don't threaten us!

1166
01:17:08,970 --> 01:17:11,050
Cousin Bartholomew's idiot son,Nestor.

1167
01:17:11,170 --> 01:17:15,460
The 47-year-old virgin in diapers. Oh,the people will rejoice.

1168
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:17,570
Enough!

1169
01:17:17,740 --> 01:17:20,380
Edvard,you will be the next king of Denmark.

1170
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:22,700
-Do you hear me? -Yes,sir.

1171
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:27,780
Now,about your young lady.

1172
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:30,280
If you say you love her as you do,

1173
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:34,920
and you believe she will make you happy,then marry her.

1174
01:17:35,070 --> 01:17:37,590
Haraald,you can't mean that.

1175
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:39,460
Maybe this is not a good time to discuss...

1176
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:42,380
No,it's a perfect time.

1177
01:17:42,550 --> 01:17:45,600
It is at the end of a man's life when he realizes

1178
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:49,070
how important his decisions were at the beginning.

1179
01:17:52,290 --> 01:17:57,190
And in 1502,King Gustav lV fell,hit his head on a rock,

1180
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:58,820
had his famous moment of enlightenment. 

1181
01:17:58,970 --> 01:18:00,270
Claimed he saw God

1182
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:02,250
at the bottom of this lake.

1183
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:05,700
He went charging off through the castle to tell everyone.

1184
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:08,150
Unfortunately,he was carrying a torch.

1185
01:18:08,270 --> 01:18:10,760
Curtains caught fire,burnt down half the palace.

1186
01:18:10,910 --> 01:18:13,080
Thus,observe the new wing.

1187
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:17,260
He takes great pleasure in twisting my ancestors' history.

1188
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:28,880
Today has been the most incredible day of my life.

1189
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,170
Come with me.

1190
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:40,750
I have something important to tell you.

1191
01:18:40,930 --> 01:18:42,690
Yeah?

1192
01:18:42,870 --> 01:18:44,910
The reason I had to come back...

1193
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:50,370
...is because my father has decided to pass the crown to me.

1194
01:18:51,070 --> 01:18:53,430
So you're gonna be king.

1195
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,790
Yes.

1196
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:02,550
I love you so much.

1197
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:05,670
And I know the sacrifices you would have to make.

1198
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:11,550
What are you doing?

1199
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:21,100
Paige Morgan,

1200
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:24,450
will you marry me?

1201
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:31,270
Yes.

1202
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:36,680
Oh,good morning.

1203
01:20:36,810 --> 01:20:38,930
-Good morning,ma'am. -Good morning.

1204
01:20:42,820 --> 01:20:45,090
-Coffee? -Oh,I can get it myself

1205
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:46,740
if you show me where the kitchen is.

1206
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:49,010
Or a Starbucks?

1207
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:58,490
-Grande decaf nonfat latte. -Yes,ma'am.

1208
01:21:00,350 --> 01:21:02,040
Congratulations!

1209
01:21:02,210 --> 01:21:05,100
You and Edvard getting married! It's so romantic!

1210
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:07,830
-You must be Arabella. -Call me Ari.

1211
01:21:07,990 --> 01:21:10,040
Isn't it wonderful? We're going to be sisters.

1212
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:15,460
More hugging?

1213
01:21:15,590 --> 01:21:17,550
-Whatever will we do with you? -Thank you.

1214
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:20,980
Well,then,I thought we might run through your schedule for the day.

1215
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:23,160
I have a schedule?

1216
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:24,960
As of this morning you do.

1217
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:26,660
Come on.

1218
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:30,400
At 9:00,you have a groundbreaking with Edvard.

1219
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,810
Also attending will be Countess Yungen.

1220
01:21:32,980 --> 01:21:35,530
Remember,if you're facing her,the good eye is the left one.

1221
01:21:35,710 --> 01:21:37,970
At 10:15,there's a photo opportunity.

1222
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:40,630
Holding hands with Edvard on the royal yacht.

1223
01:21:40,790 --> 01:21:44,300
Opening of a Miro exhibit at the museum at noon.

1224
01:21:44,470 --> 01:21:47,180
12:40 is when you can call your parents.

1225
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:50,030
Yes,a 1:00 luncheon with the queen.

1226
01:21:52,970 --> 01:21:54,530
Deep breaths.

1227
01:21:55,390 --> 01:21:57,510
You'll get through this in spectacular fashion.

1228
01:21:57,650 --> 01:22:01,810
After all,that's what the people expect of our future queen.

1229
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,490
Oh,my God.

1230
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:06,350
What?

1231
01:22:06,490 --> 01:22:08,020
Queen.

1232
01:22:08,150 --> 01:22:09,300
I mean,I knew it worked that way,

1233
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:12,020
but I hadn't really thought about it like that.

1234
01:22:12,180 --> 01:22:15,410
Do you think that people are gonna mind if I'm gonna be their queen

1235
01:22:15,570 --> 01:22:18,810
-and all I've seen is the airport? -No.

1236
01:22:21,630 --> 01:22:22,950
Anna.

1237
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:26,380
Do you a have dress for Eddie's coronation ball yet?

1238
01:22:27,530 --> 01:22:29,710
-No. -You may come in now.

1239
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:32,480
This is Margueritte. 

1240
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,280
She can design anything you like.

1241
01:22:34,410 --> 01:22:37,430
Chanel,Dior,Armani,Prada.

1242
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:40,500
-It's very nice to meet you. -Turn.

1243
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:41,650
Excuse me?

1244
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,480
Turn.

1245
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:46,170
Come,ladies.

1246
01:22:48,150 --> 01:22:49,690
Long torso.

1247
01:22:50,630 --> 01:22:52,010
Good figure.

1248
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:54,650
Terrible American posture.

1249
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:59,080
I don't work with hunchbacks.

1250
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:03,160
-When is the wedding,Miss Morgan? -Good morning.

1251
01:23:03,740 --> 01:23:05,370
When these plants are completed,

1252
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:07,770
Denmark will lead the European community

1253
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:11,290
in vegetable oil and specialty fat production.

1254
01:23:30,590 --> 01:23:32,110
Farm girl.

1255
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:45,730
So where do the future king and queen go on their honeymoon?

1256
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:47,420
I was thinking Morocco.

1257
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:50,190
It's really hard to organize security there.

1258
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:51,820
Oh,right,OK.

1259
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:53,140
What about Spain?

1260
01:23:53,310 --> 01:23:54,980
Yes,Spain is good.

1261
01:23:55,110 --> 01:23:57,690
I'm sure King Juan Carlos won't mind lending us his private island

1262
01:23:57,830 --> 01:24:00,200
for a few weeks in the summer.

1263
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:04,970
I swear.

1264
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:09,870
Well,it's hanging well in the front.

1265
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,750
Is this part supposed to be loose?

1266
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:13,970
-She doesn't speak. -At all?

1267
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:15,090
To you.

1268
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:17,940
Well,is this part supposed to be loose?

1269
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:20,750
Well,it has been worn that way for the past 200 years.

1270
01:24:48,620 --> 01:24:53,720
The opening of this new wing of the Dangard Pediatric Hospital illustrates...

1271
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,280
-Where's Paige? -I don't know.

1272
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:58,700
...our country's commitment to improving healthcare

1273
01:24:58,830 --> 01:25:00,700
for all of our people...

1274
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:05,320
There she is.

1275
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:12,110
I was just being nice to some kids.

1276
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:15,630
Which every paper felt compelled to report.

1277
01:25:15,790 --> 01:25:18,110
Well,what's wrong with that?

1278
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:20,850
That you did it in a new,state-of-the-art,

1279
01:25:20,970 --> 01:25:24,530
government-funded,billion-kroner hospital,

1280
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:28,020
which suddenly all these newspapers have no interest in mentioning.

1281
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:33,460
We had an opportunity on the eve of a national strike,

1282
01:25:33,590 --> 01:25:36,370
to show the people what their healthcare system can do for them.

1283
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:38,980
Instead,all they know is that you are nice to children.

1284
01:25:39,110 --> 01:25:40,930
I'm sorry. I'm trying.

1285
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:44,010
It's gonna take me a while to get the hang of things.

1286
01:25:44,150 --> 01:25:47,400
Being royal is not like being famous or being rich.

1287
01:25:47,540 --> 01:25:49,780
It is something much,much more.

1288
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:54,140
It is a way of being that can only be learned from birth.

1289
01:25:54,310 --> 01:25:56,690
It is an embodiment

1290
01:25:56,810 --> 01:25:59,360
which requires you to sacrifice who you are

1291
01:25:59,490 --> 01:26:01,430
for who you must be.

1292
01:26:02,310 --> 01:26:06,200
Well,I'm Paige Morgan from Manitowoc,Wisconsin.

1293
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:08,970
Paige Morgan can no longer exist.

1294
01:26:09,150 --> 01:26:11,250
She is gone.

1295
01:26:11,430 --> 01:26:15,540
You are now the future queen of Denmark...

1296
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:18,160
...plain and simple.

1297
01:26:26,670 --> 01:26:28,720
Excuse me,Your Majesty.

1298
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:31,220
Your Royal Highness,it's time to leave.

1299
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,430
All right. Thank you,Soren.

1300
01:26:46,130 --> 01:26:48,510
His Royal Highness,the crown prince.

1301
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:50,320
-Royal Highness. -Prime minister.

1302
01:26:50,490 --> 01:26:52,570
Good morning,ladies and gentlemen. 

1303
01:26:52,730 --> 01:26:54,090
In the interest of expedience,

1304
01:26:54,210 --> 01:26:56,900
I've asked the lead negotiator for the national unions

1305
01:26:57,040 --> 01:27:00,050
and the lead negotiator for our nation's corporate interests to join us.

1306
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:01,660
Good morning.

1307
01:27:01,810 --> 01:27:04,640
-I'm very pleased to meet you. -Nice to meet you again.

1308
01:27:06,890 --> 01:27:08,420
Your Royal Highness.

1309
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:12,210
I know your exposure to these proceedings has been rather limited...

1310
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:15,330
Mr. Anderson,I'm well aware of the traditions and the protocols

1311
01:27:15,470 --> 01:27:17,370
of this chamber,and while I respect them,

1312
01:27:17,490 --> 01:27:21,150
we only have six hours before all hell breaks loose.

1313
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:23,980
So don't you think the time for gamesmanship has passed?

1314
01:27:24,110 --> 01:27:26,800
-Yes,sir. -Then we are in agreement.

1315
01:27:26,970 --> 01:27:28,440
Please be seated.

1316
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:32,060
And get comfortable

1317
01:27:32,210 --> 01:27:34,330
because we're not leaving here until this is solved.

1318
01:27:37,930 --> 01:27:39,900
And where will this additional money come from?

1319
01:27:40,050 --> 01:27:42,440
Well,perhaps management will tighten their belts.

1320
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:43,700
-Our belts? -Yes! 

1321
01:27:43,830 --> 01:27:45,340
It might do you some good to go without.

1322
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:47,060
These are businesses,not charities.

1323
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:49,750
If we can't come to a resolution about wages,

1324
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:51,980
perhaps we can discuss concessions on benefits.

1325
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,000
-No concessions! -You take and take

1326
01:27:54,160 --> 01:27:55,800
and will give nothing in return!

1327
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:56,870
You are impossible!

1328
01:27:56,990 --> 01:28:00,000
Gentlemen,please. Let's remember this is not about us.

1329
01:28:05,070 --> 01:28:07,550
You know,when I was in America,

1330
01:28:07,670 --> 01:28:10,850
I spent some time with Paige's family on her farm.

1331
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:13,690
And they explained something to me.

1332
01:28:13,820 --> 01:28:16,220
That we are all interdependent.

1333
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:18,520
So we had better start caring for our opposition

1334
01:28:18,670 --> 01:28:20,910
as much as we do for ourselves.

1335
01:28:22,890 --> 01:28:24,060
I wonder if anyone on this table

1336
01:28:24,190 --> 01:28:27,030
knows what it's like to work for a tiny wage.

1337
01:28:27,190 --> 01:28:31,150
And then to see that wage get sliced up even further by taxes.

1338
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:32,210
Now,I can tell you from experience,

1339
01:28:32,330 --> 01:28:34,540
it can be a mighty struggle.

1340
01:28:35,410 --> 01:28:37,300
But then I suspect it would be substantially more difficult

1341
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:39,780
to see your job...

1342
01:28:39,970 --> 01:28:43,720
...and your benefits disappear altogether.

1343
01:28:43,890 --> 01:28:48,190
Now,at the moment,we are six percent apart. Correct?

1344
01:28:48,340 --> 01:28:51,190
Now,if the goal is to let the workers keep more

1345
01:28:51,330 --> 01:28:53,260
without damaging the corporation,

1346
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:56,440
then perhaps there's a third path to consider.

1347
01:28:57,830 --> 01:29:00,590
He was brilliant. He got the unions to lower their demands,

1348
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:02,250
the corporations to raise their offer,

1349
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:05,300
and Parliament to cut the workers' wage tax to make up the difference.

1350
01:29:05,450 --> 01:29:08,410
Now,that's impressive. OK,about the dress.

1351
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:10,350
Am I supposed to be able to breathe?

1352
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:13,110
-No. -Oh,well,then it's perfect.

1353
01:29:14,130 --> 01:29:16,940
Miss Paige,the queen would like to see you immediately.

1354
01:29:19,190 --> 01:29:21,780
Don't worry. I'll be by your side the entire time.

1355
01:29:34,150 --> 01:29:36,890
-Soren,get out. -Yes,Your Majesty.

1356
01:29:37,910 --> 01:29:39,580
Thanks.

1357
01:29:41,270 --> 01:29:42,980
These are my new babies.

1358
01:29:44,550 --> 01:29:46,670
My new hopefuls.

1359
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:58,080
I know you think I don't like you.

1360
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:07,590
I like traditions.

1361
01:30:09,030 --> 01:30:10,750
I like traditions,

1362
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:13,890
and I like consistency and continuity,

1363
01:30:14,060 --> 01:30:17,000
and I don't like change.

1364
01:30:18,230 --> 01:30:20,070
But...

1365
01:30:20,210 --> 01:30:22,800
...when that change is for the better...

1366
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:28,100
...when it helps turn a boy into a man...

1367
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:30,960
...then I have to reconsider.

1368
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:36,900
Two weeks ago,I thought you were the end of the monarchy.

1369
01:30:38,210 --> 01:30:41,630
Now I see you may be the best thing that ever happened to us.

1370
01:30:43,580 --> 01:30:45,370
Thank you.

1371
01:30:48,230 --> 01:30:50,270
And now we have that settled...

1372
01:30:51,550 --> 01:30:54,320
...we have to make you into the best queen

1373
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:56,680
that Denmark has ever had.

1374
01:30:56,850 --> 01:30:59,150
Come with me.

1375
01:31:00,050 --> 01:31:01,500
Between you and me,Paige,

1376
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:05,380
being queen is not without its charms.

1377
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:44,510
So,my dear,

1378
01:31:44,970 --> 01:31:48,690
what would you like to wear to the coronation ball?

1379
01:32:04,590 --> 01:32:06,380
Very beautiful.

1380
01:32:07,930 --> 01:32:08,960
Your ears will be killing you

1381
01:32:09,070 --> 01:32:11,820
by the end of the evening,though. Trust me.

1382
01:32:33,010 --> 01:32:34,700
Harry Winston.

1383
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:39,070
It's very appropriate.

1384
01:33:12,230 --> 01:33:13,700
Sorry. Would you excuse me? 

1385
01:33:13,850 --> 01:33:16,140
-Certainly,sir. -Yes,Your Highness.

1386
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:21,450
Sorry. Pardon me.

1387
01:33:21,570 --> 01:33:24,230
Paige,may I have this dance?

1388
01:33:24,390 --> 01:33:26,010
Of course.

1389
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:35,920
I hope you don't mind,but I've requested our song.

1390
01:33:36,070 --> 01:33:37,590
We have a song?

1391
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:43,830
We have a song.

1392
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:33,100
Let's go somewhere.

1393
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:53,930
It kind of bothers me.

1394
01:34:55,370 --> 01:34:56,790
Right. Come with me.

1395
01:35:17,350 --> 01:35:18,930
Excuse me,sir. 

1396
01:35:19,060 --> 01:35:20,910
I know that you and your father wanted to speak privately

1397
01:35:21,030 --> 01:35:23,070
with the king of Norway before he left.

1398
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:25,060
Right,of course. Thank you,Soren.

1399
01:35:29,590 --> 01:35:33,270
Listen,when I get back,I've got a special treat for you.

1400
01:35:33,410 --> 01:35:34,340
Oh,good. I was wondering

1401
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:36,590
when I was going to start being treated well.

1402
01:35:48,210 --> 01:35:50,530
-Good to see you. -Good to see you,sir.

1403
01:35:50,650 --> 01:35:52,100
Edvard.

1404
01:35:52,230 --> 01:35:54,860
-You remember my son,Edvard? -Very nice to meet you.

1405
01:35:54,990 --> 01:35:56,720
-Nice to see you again. -You too.

1406
01:35:56,870 --> 01:35:59,680
Father,I really think you should be sitting down.

1407
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:02,900
Did those Egyptian photographers make you pose

1408
01:36:03,030 --> 01:36:05,480
for all those photos riding on camels?

1409
01:36:05,620 --> 01:36:08,270
-Yeah. -Interesting creatures.

1410
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:12,270
They store all that water,but they never seem to bathe in it.

1411
01:36:12,430 --> 01:36:14,010
Oh,yeah.

1412
01:36:14,190 --> 01:36:16,420
So down to business.

1413
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:18,950
We have to talk about fishing rights. 

1414
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:21,570
We've both signed a treaty.

1415
01:36:21,740 --> 01:36:28,850
The main thing is to maintain stock and to respect...

1416
01:37:28,540 --> 01:37:30,770
Right,I've got something to show you.

1417
01:37:31,730 --> 01:37:33,420
Stay there.

1418
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:42,160
Now,

1419
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:44,980
relax,my dear,as I make you...

1420
01:37:45,170 --> 01:37:47,730
...the perfect sandwich.

1421
01:37:47,870 --> 01:37:49,800
I think you'll find...

1422
01:37:49,950 --> 01:37:51,510
...that the student

1423
01:37:51,630 --> 01:37:54,090
has now become the teacher.

1424
01:37:55,270 --> 01:37:57,840
I can see how proud your father is of you.

1425
01:37:57,980 --> 01:37:59,770
Yes.

1426
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:09,580
Eddie,this has all been extraordinary.

1427
01:38:11,250 --> 01:38:13,220
A real life fairy tale.

1428
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:18,750
But I can't do it anymore.

1429
01:38:23,080 --> 01:38:24,830
What?

1430
01:38:26,420 --> 01:38:28,270
What are you saying?

1431
01:38:28,450 --> 01:38:30,950
I'm saying I can't stay.

1432
01:38:33,990 --> 01:38:35,740
Well,what's the matter?

1433
01:38:39,590 --> 01:38:41,750
When I first met you,

1434
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:44,830
I was so focused because I was scared.

1435
01:38:45,970 --> 01:38:46,980
And you got me out of that,

1436
01:38:47,090 --> 01:38:50,010
which is the greatest thing anyone's ever done for me.

1437
01:38:51,090 --> 01:38:52,670
But I'm still me,and all the things

1438
01:38:52,790 --> 01:38:55,500
that I want to do are still a part of me,

1439
01:38:55,690 --> 01:38:58,420
and I thought I could make myself forget about that,

1440
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:00,680
but I can't.

1441
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:04,940
What about us?

1442
01:39:05,090 --> 01:39:07,520
You belong here,not me.

1443
01:39:07,690 --> 01:39:09,820
And your father needs you to be there...

1444
01:39:09,950 --> 01:39:14,230
...for your mother and Arabella.

1445
01:39:21,460 --> 01:39:24,750
I mean,is that it? We never see each other again?

1446
01:39:26,550 --> 01:39:28,920
I don't know.

1447
01:39:32,490 --> 01:39:33,670
I don't know.

1448
01:39:53,580 --> 01:39:55,750
I can't make you stay,can I?

1449
01:39:58,380 --> 01:40:00,170
I can't make you stay.

1450
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:25,920
丹麦语

1451
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:14,610
Long live His Majesty,King Edvard lll.

1452
01:41:39,050 --> 01:41:44,630
Today marks a profound,though bittersweet,milestone for all of us...

1453
01:41:44,820 --> 01:41:49,930
...as we bear witness to both an end and a beginning.

1454
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:53,740
And while we must continue on,

1455
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:56,380
we must also be grateful

1456
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:59,360
to have been blessed with someone

1457
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:04,940
who has so ably guided us to where we are today.

1458
01:42:07,990 --> 01:42:10,980
When there has been so much love...

1459
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:15,760
...and happiness for someone...

1460
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:19,630
...it is natural to be reluctant...

1461
01:42:19,820 --> 01:42:23,860
...to close such a wonderful chapter in our lives.

1462
01:42:26,220 --> 01:42:29,630
-Excuse me. -For moving forward

1463
01:42:29,790 --> 01:42:32,980
is rarely accomplished without considerable grief 

1464
01:42:33,150 --> 01:42:35,470
and sadness.

1465
01:42:37,330 --> 01:42:40,500
And while our sorrow may be profound...

1466
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:43,950
...the clouds will clear...

1467
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:47,040
...and the sun will shine on us again.

1468
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:54,470
And in that warm,bright light...

1469
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:59,300
...we will find ourselves facing a glorious future.

1470
01:43:00,580 --> 01:43:03,340
A future of exciting challenges...

1471
01:43:04,140 --> 01:43:06,660
...and infinite possibility...

1472
01:43:08,110 --> 01:43:11,700
...in which the horizon will stretch out before us...

1473
01:43:13,050 --> 01:43:15,270
...rimmed in the heavenly glow...

1474
01:43:15,450 --> 01:43:18,250
...of the sunrise of our tomorrow.

1475
01:44:21,690 --> 01:44:22,690
Can everybody...?

1476
01:44:22,820 --> 01:44:24,960
Can we get the girls together for a group shot?

1477
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:27,170
Just a quick one. OK. 

1478
01:44:27,330 --> 01:44:29,190
Great. All right.

1479
01:44:29,340 --> 01:44:31,130
OK. Amy,sweetheart.

1480
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:35,130
All right,Amy. Amy,here. All right,girls? Girls?

1481
01:44:35,270 --> 01:44:38,430
-Say,"Cheese curds". -Cheese curds!

1482
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:40,110
Excellent.

1483
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:41,910
Beautiful,girls.

1484
01:44:43,330 --> 01:44:45,420
I'm so proud of you.

1485
01:44:46,980 --> 01:44:48,520
Let me see.

1486
01:44:49,730 --> 01:44:50,880
Oh,sweetheart...

1487
01:44:50,990 --> 01:44:53,430
Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful

1488
01:45:11,310 --> 01:45:13,610
I want you in my life,Paige.

1489
01:45:15,130 --> 01:45:17,450
I want to marry you.

1490
01:45:17,580 --> 01:45:20,440
If that means I have to wait until you finish medical school,

1491
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:22,940
become a doctor and anything else you want to do,

1492
01:45:23,070 --> 01:45:26,220
then I'll do it.

1493
01:45:26,390 --> 01:45:28,640
I'll wait.

1494
01:45:28,810 --> 01:45:31,700
Denmark isn't ready for a queen like me.

1495
01:45:33,660 --> 01:45:36,470
Well,then they'll have to be...

1496
01:45:38,070 --> 01:45:40,940
...because I am.

1497
01:45:41,110 --> 00:00:00,000

1498
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
