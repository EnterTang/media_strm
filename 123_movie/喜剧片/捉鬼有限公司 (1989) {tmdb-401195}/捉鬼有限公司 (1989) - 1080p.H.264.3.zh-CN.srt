18
00:03:30,086 --> 00:03:31,419
马弘
Mahiro.

19
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:41,586
你出生后
After you were born...

20
00:03:42,836 --> 00:03:45,336
当你16个月大的时候
when you were about 16 months old...

21
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:50,044
当我和你在一起的时候

22
00:03:52,753 --> 00:03:53,794
你妈妈和我

25
00:04:05,544 --> 00:04:06,878

我现在有了另一个家庭

27
00:04:19,711 --> 00:04:21,544
但是
But...

28
00:04:24,586 --> 00:04:26,378
马弘
Mahiro...

29
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:31,086
你是我的第一个孩子

32
00:04:45,544 --> 00:04:46,794
然而
However...

33
00:04:48,628 --> 00:04:52,128
因为我现在有了另一个家庭
because I have another family now...

34
00:04:54,669 --> 00:05:00,211
他们告诉我不要联系你
they told me not to contact you.

35
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,294
现在
And now...

37
00:05:19,711 --> 00:05:21,378
马弘

00:05:23,586 --> 00:05:26,503
你觉得呢 既然我回来了？

39
00:05:26,836 --> 00:05:28,669
我很高兴你回来了

00:05:53,518 --> 00:05:55,226
在学校或任何地方
at school or wherever...

45
00:05:58,851 --> 00:06:04,851
事实上我不在身边
The fact I'm not around...

46
00:06:07,184 --> 00:06:10,601
你的朋友或其他人有说过什么吗？
Did your friends or anyone say anything about that?

47
00:06:14,184 --> 00:06:15,684
总是让我担心
That always worried me.

48
00:06:15,851 --> 00:06:16,976
没事的
It's okay.

Really?

52
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:33,518
要我帮你拉近点吗？
Should I bring it closer for you?

53
00:06:36,934 --> 00:06:38,351
太棒了！
That's amazing!

54
00:06:44,018 --> 00:06:45,851
马弘 给我照张相

55
00:06:50,976 --> 00:06:51,643
怎么样？

00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:12,684
我要了
I'm taking it.

63
00:07:15,851 --> 00:07:17,018
那是个好主意
That's a good one.

64
00:07:17,184 --> 00:07:18,934
我们捕捉到了樱花
We captured the cherry blossom.

65
00:07:31,268 --> 00:07:34,809
哦 太好了！看起来我戴着一条花围巾

00:07:35,018 --> 00:07:37,184
让我带你一个
Let me take one of you.

67
00:07:37,351 --> 00:07:38,601

68
00:07:39,684 --> 00:07:40,643

Sure?

69
00:07:41,018 --> 00:07:43,268
我想要很多花的照片
I want lots of pictures of the flowers.

70
00:07:45,184 --> 00:07:48,434
我妈妈喜欢樱花
My mom likes cherry blossom.

71
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:52,809
在这儿怎么样？
How about over here?

72
00:07:54,351 --> 00:07:55,768
抬头看！
Look straight up!

73
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:14,874
马弘
Mahiro...

74
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:18,916
-你和你妈妈相处得好吗？-是的

75
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,583

见到我你紧张吗？
Were you nervous about meeting me?

77
00:08:28,874 --> 00:08:30,999
-不是真的 -你不是吗？
- Not really. - You weren't?

78
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:34,708
也许有一点 但我一直很期待
Maybe a little. But I've been looking forward to it.

79
00:08:34,874 --> 00:08:35,999
真的？
Really?

80
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:41,708
事实上你是
The fact that you were...

81
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:47,374
勇敢地一个人来
brave enough to come alone...

82
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,624
真的 那是
Really, that was...

83
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:56,416
鉴于我们已经十年没见面了
Given that we haven't seen each other for ten years...

84
00:08:57,749 --> 00:09:05,124
我没想到你会一个人来这里
I didn't expect you to come here all by yourself.

85
00:09:06,641 --> 00:09:08,683
当我站在那里的时候
When I was standing there,

86
00:09:08,974 --> 00:09:12,058
你用手机给我拍了张照片 是吗？
you took a picture of me with your phone, didn't you?

87
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:17,891
我马上就知道了
I knew right away.

88
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,766
马弘
Mahiro...

89
00:09:21,308 --> 00:09:23,599
所以事情就是这样
So that's how it is.

90
00:09:42,447 --> 00:09:43,697
他们太棒了！
They're amazing!

92
00:10:39,322 --> 00:10:40,739
我不记得了

93
00:10:40,905 --> 00:10:43,489
你经常在户外活动 对吧？

94

不 我大多呆在家里

95
00:10:46,072 --> 00:10:47,239

00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:24,614
我女儿过得怎么样？
How did things go with my daughter?

105
00:12:24,947 --> 00:12:26,239
马弘
Mahiro...

106
00:12:27,197 --> 00:12:29,989
一开始很害羞 你知道吗？
was shy at first, you know?

107
00:12:30,155 --> 00:12:31,322
当然
Of course.

108
00:12:32,614 --> 00:12:36,530
但后来我们去看樱花
But then we went to look at the cherry blossom,

109
00:12:36,697 --> 00:12:38,905
我们四处走动
we walked around,

110
00:12:39,072 --> 00:12:40,905
拍了一些照片
took some pictures...

111
00:12:41,405 --> 00:12:45,905
有些人在玩杂耍
Some guys there were juggling.

112
00:12:46,072 --> 00:12:49,447
我觉得她玩得很开心
I think she had a lot of fun.

113
00:12:49,614 --> 00:12:51,197
哦 我很高兴
Oh, I'm glad.

114
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,697
我可以看一下订单吗？
May I look at the order form?

115
00:12:53,864 --> 00:12:54,864
前进
Go ahead.

116
00:12:57,322 --> 00:13:01,614
啊 她爸爸以前一直玩马
Ah, her father used to play horse all the time.

117
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,364
她记得吗？
Did she remember that?

118
00:13:04,989 --> 00:13:07,280
我问过马弘
I asked Mahiro about it

119
00:13:07,739 --> 00:13:09,239
但她不记得了
but she didn't remember.

120
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:10,947
哦 我明白了
Oh, I see.

121
00:13:13,822 --> 00:13:16,114
她过去常常骑在他的肩膀上
She used to ride on his shoulders.

122
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,697
那怎么样？
How about that?

123
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,322
我问过她那件事 但她不记得了
I asked her about that but she didn't remember.

124
00:13:23,697 --> 00:13:24,614
也
Also,

125
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:30,780
马弘的真父亲眼睛抽搐
Mahiro's real father has an eye twitch.

126
00:13:30,947 --> 00:13:32,989
我肯定她会记得的
I was sure she'd remember that.

127
00:13:33,155 --> 00:13:36,780
婴儿真的看父母的眼睛
Infants really look into the eyes of their parents.

128
00:13:36,947 --> 00:13:39,114
是的 我明白了 这样地？
Yes, I see. Like this?

129
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,864
我知道我们要求你提供很多细节
I know we ask you to provide many details.

130
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,989
但我们的政策
But our policy

131
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,322
家庭恋情
at Family Romance

132
00:13:49,489 --> 00:13:53,280
我们只能做真正的自己
is that we can only do what we really are.

133
00:13:53,447 --> 00:13:54,614
所以
So...

134
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:58,530
比如说 如果我要为马弘抽动眼睛
for example, if I were to twitch my eyes for Mahiro,

135
00:13:58,697 --> 00:14:01,072
看起来我在装模作样
it would look like I was putting on an act.

136
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:02,864
这是我的看法
That was my opinion.

137
00:14:03,864 --> 00:14:06,030
所以我不想假装
So I didn't want to fake it.

138
00:14:08,072 --> 00:14:10,614
非常感谢你 石井先生

我增加了额外的费用
I've added extra for expenses.

142
00:14:17,364 --> 00:14:21,989
我有食物和杂物的收据
I have the receipts for food and sundries.

143
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:27,572
我以后可能会带来更多的收据

144

我们应该避免使用正式语言

我刚收到你妈妈的信

你父亲患有癫痫

真的很尴尬
It's really embarrassing.

207
00:19:26,628 --> 00:19:29,128

208
00:19:29,295 --> 00:19:30,878
我相信是的
I believe so.

209

你见到你父亲不高兴吗？

223

发生了什么？

你不害怕吧？

230
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,420
看来我们要淹死了
It looks like we're going to drown.

231

00:28:36,003 --> 00:28:37,962
每天 我都感到不安
Every day, I feel uneasy.

296
00:28:40,212 --> 00:28:41,670
我懂了
I see.

297
00:28:41,837 --> 00:28:45,795
我希望我更像狐狸
I wish I were more like the Fox.

298
00:28:45,962 --> 00:28:47,295
当然

00:28:49,045 --> 00:28:50,545
祝你好运

00:30:01,503 --> 00:30:02,503
马弘

301
00:30:05,878 --> 00:30:07,295
那孩子是谁？
Who's the kid?

302
00:30:08,045 --> 00:30:09,545
我是艾瑞
This is Airi.

303
00:30:10,378 --> 00:30:12,753
其他的孩子不会和她一起出去的
The other kids won't hang out with her

304
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,962
所以她经常和我在一起
so she often joins me.

305
00:30:15,503 --> 00:30:17,295
-是这样吗 艾瑞？-是的
- Is that so, Airi? - Yeah.

306

我可以和你一起坐吗？
May I sit with you?

307
00:30:29,837 --> 00:30:30,920
艾瑞？
Airi?

308
00:30:31,878 --> 00:30:34,670
谁给你挑的？
Who picked this out for you?

309
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,545
我妈妈
My mom.

310
00:30:35,712 --> 00:30:36,587
你妈妈？
Your mom?

311
00:30:37,378 --> 00:30:39,212
这些花真可爱
The flowers are really cute.

312
00:30:40,045 --> 00:30:42,253
-这些怎么样？-我妈妈买的
- How about these? - My mom got them.

313
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,837
它们和你的衣服很相配！
They match your dress!

314
00:30:47,462 --> 00:30:48,378
艾瑞！
Airi!

315
00:30:48,962 --> 00:30:51,837
你长大后想做什么？
What do you want to be when you grow up?

316
00:30:52,462 --> 00:30:55,628
一只兔子 长发公主和一名消防队员
A bunny, Rapunzel and a fire fighter.

317
00:30:55,795 --> 00:30:57,045
对吗？
Is that right?

318
00:30:57,295 --> 00:30:59,545
你想做什么都行
You can be anything you want.

319
00:31:03,378 --> 00:31:07,045
其他孩子欺负她
The other kids bully her,

320
00:31:07,212 --> 00:31:10,712
说她在火灾中被烧死了
saying she's been burned in a fire

321
00:31:10,878 --> 00:31:14,128
因为她皮肤黝黑
because she's dark-skinned.

322
00:31:14,295 --> 00:31:17,128
因为其他孩子对她很刻薄
As the other kids are mean to her,

323
00:31:17,295 --> 00:31:20,712
我带她到处走
I take her around with me.

324
00:31:27,128 --> 00:31:30,253
我们为什么不去看看天空树呢？
Why don't we check out the Sky Tree?

325
00:31:31,128 --> 00:31:32,378
让我们？
Shall we?

326
00:31:43,462 --> 00:31:46,128
那边的那个真高！
That's a really tall one over there!

327
00:31:46,295 --> 00:31:47,420
哦 是的！
Oh yeah!

328
00:31:47,753 --> 00:31:49,295
这是一座高楼 好吧！
It's a tall building alright!

329
00:31:49,795 --> 00:31:51,503
看 火车来了！
Look, there's a train coming!

330
00:31:52,295 --> 00:31:54,462
那是什么颜色的火车？
What color train is that?

331
00:31:55,295 --> 00:31:56,087
橙色
Orange.

332
00:31:56,253 --> 00:31:58,087
这是正确的
That's right.

333
00:31:59,003 --> 00:32:00,712
看这边
Look this way.

334
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,795
有一个直升机平台
There's a helicopter platform.

335
00:32:05,962 --> 00:32:08,212
在那边 你看到了吗？
Over there, can you see it?

336
00:32:21,837 --> 00:32:24,712
我想让你给她一个拥抱
Airi wants you to give her a hug.

337
00:32:25,837 --> 00:32:27,003
我们拥抱一下好吗？
Shall we hug?

338
00:32:38,337 --> 00:32:39,628
你害羞吗？
Are you shy?

339
00:32:39,795 --> 00:32:41,087
你不是吗？
You're not?

340
00:32:54,878 --> 00:32:57,545
我也可以拥抱一下吗？
Can I have a hug too?

341
00:34:29,462 --> 00:34:31,295
许个愿
Make a wish.

342
00:35:31,743 --> 00:35:33,743
你赢了多少钱？
So, how much did you win?

343
00:35:35,618 --> 00:35:38,160
两千万日元（18万美元）
Twenty million yen ($180,000).

344
00:35:39,535 --> 00:35:41,118
两千万日元！
Twenty million yen!

345
00:35:41,285 --> 00:35:42,243
对
Yes.

346
00:35:42,827 --> 00:35:44,368
太不可思议了
That's incredible.

347
00:35:45,368 --> 00:35:46,868
你赢了那么多？
You won that much?

348
00:35:49,077 --> 00:35:51,285
太不可思议了
That's unbelievable.

349
00:35:51,493 --> 00:35:53,285
两千万日元！
Twenty million yen!

350
00:35:54,035 --> 00:35:55,993
那么 你赢之前发生了什么？
So, what happened before you won?

351
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:59,077
在那之前
Up until then...

352
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:05,577
没有什么好事发生在我身上
nothing good ever really happened to me.

353
00:36:06,202 --> 00:36:10,368
那是最美妙的时刻
That was the single most amazing moment

354
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:14,243
在我的一生中
in my entire life.

355
00:36:16,077 --> 00:36:18,160
你赢的时候发生了什么？
What happened when you won?

356
00:36:20,577 --> 00:36:23,285
有人来找我
Someone came to my door.

357
00:36:24,577 --> 00:36:27,827
我被要求出示身份证
I was asked for my identification.

358
00:36:27,993 --> 00:36:30,993
当我给他们看我的身份证时
When I showed them my ID,

359
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,952
我发现我是赢家
I found out I was a winner

360
00:36:34,118 --> 00:36:37,202
这是我有生以来第一次
for the first time in my life.

361
00:36:37,827 --> 00:36:40,160
我很震惊
I was shocked.

362
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,577
我变白了
I turned white.

363
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,577
我想是的
I would imagine so.

364
00:36:45,743 --> 00:36:52,035
我不知道这是怎么回事
I had no idea that's how it works.

365
00:36:54,535 --> 00:36:57,660
我能帮你什么忙吗？
Is there anything I can do to help you?

366
00:36:58,952 --> 00:36:59,993
好
Well...

367
00:37:00,702 --> 00:37:02,077
我赢了以后
after I won,

368
00:37:02,243 --> 00:37:06,785
我觉得我想再次拥有那种感觉
I felt like I wanted to have that feeling again.

369
00:37:08,035 --> 00:37:12,827
所以我买了成百上千的票
So I've been buying hundreds, thousands of tickets.

370
00:37:14,243 --> 00:37:20,285
我有生之年可能不会再赢了
I might not win again in my lifetime

371
00:37:20,827 --> 00:37:25,868
但我总是希望好运能回到我身边
but I always hope luck may return to me.

372
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:32,327
可能需要100年
It might take 100 years

373
00:37:32,493 --> 00:37:35,243
但我一直在买票
but I keep buying tickets.

374
00:37:35,827 --> 00:37:37,160
是这样吗？
Is that so?

375
00:37:39,827 --> 00:37:41,452
如果是这样的话
If that's the case...

376
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:45,702
我想我能帮你
I think I can help you.

377
00:37:45,868 --> 00:37:48,452
这绝对是个惊喜
It will be a total surprise.

378
00:37:48,618 --> 00:37:50,118
听起来怎么样？
How does that sound?

379
00:37:51,285 --> 00:37:53,702
是的 请
Yes, please.

380
00:37:53,868 --> 00:37:55,202
我们可以做吗？
Shall we do it?

381
00:37:55,368 --> 00:37:56,493
好吧
Okay then.

382
00:38:13,493 --> 00:38:15,743
国家铁路系统
The National Train System.

383
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:16,827
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

384
00:38:16,993 --> 00:38:18,660
你知道你对它做了什么吗？
You realize what you did to it?

385
00:38:18,827 --> 00:38:20,493
你明白 不是吗？
You understand, don't you?

386
00:38:21,327 --> 00:38:24,910
如果火车晚点超过50秒
If a train is more than 50 seconds late,

387
00:38:25,243 --> 00:38:28,160
它会对整个系统产生连锁反应
it has a knock-on effect on the entire system.

388
00:38:28,827 --> 00:38:31,785
但你提前20秒释放了火车
But you released the train 20 seconds early.

389
00:38:31,952 --> 00:38:34,118
你觉得发生了什么事？
What do you think happened?

390
00:38:36,452 --> 00:38:39,285
如果火车晚点了 我们还是没事的
If the train is a little late, we're still okay.

391
00:38:39,493 --> 00:38:42,785
事实上 提前离开要糟糕得多
In reality, an early departure is far worse.

392
00:38:43,202 --> 00:38:47,160
你让火车提前20秒发车
You let the train leave 20 seconds early.

393
00:38:47,493 --> 00:38:49,035
你怎么能允许这样？
How could you allow that?

394
00:38:51,118 --> 00:38:53,452
当那件事发生的时候
When that happened...

395
00:38:54,577 --> 00:38:57,202
那列火车上有孩子
There were children on that train.

396
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:58,868
他们被困在里面
They got trapped inside.

397
00:38:59,118 --> 00:39:02,202
父母出去装行李
Parents went out to load their luggage

398
00:39:02,368 --> 00:39:05,910
火车一个人带着孩子们走了！
and the train took off with the kids alone!

399
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,827
这不是问题吗？
Is that not a problem?

400
00:39:12,993 --> 00:39:14,618
这个巨大的错误
This monumental mistake

401
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:16,577
把我们带到了出版业
led us to publishing

402
00:39:16,743 --> 00:39:21,035
每家报纸上都有一整版的道歉
a full-page apology in every newspaper.

403
00:39:21,785 --> 00:39:24,160
我们不得不正式道歉！
We had to issue a formal apology!

404
00:39:24,327 --> 00:39:26,077
你到底在想什么？
What the hell were you thinking?

405
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,993
你在想什么？
What were you thinking?

406
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:31,952
好吗？从现在开始
Alright? From now on,

407
00:39:32,118 --> 00:39:35,118
你要认真对待你的工作！
you need to take your fucking job more seriously!

408
00:39:35,285 --> 00:39:36,785
别这么傻！
Don't be such a moron!

409
00:39:37,077 --> 00:39:38,118
好吧
Alright.

410
00:39:38,868 --> 00:39:39,993
够了
That's enough.

411
00:39:40,952 --> 00:39:42,577
我在看着你
I'm watching you.

412
00:39:44,702 --> 00:39:47,368
石井 太谢谢你了 你救了我
Ishii, thank you so much. You saved me.

413
00:39:47,535 --> 00:39:49,993
你真的替我承担了责任
You really took the blame for me.

414
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:52,452
我应该多说几句吗？
Should I have said more?

415
00:39:52,618 --> 00:39:54,202
你很好
You were fine.

416
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:58,202
多亏了你 我会没事的
Thanks to you, I'll be okay.

417
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,118
不客气
You're welcome.

418
00:40:01,993 --> 00:40:03,160
我来承担责任
With me taking the blame,

419
00:40:03,327 --> 00:40:05,243
我想他们会放你鸽子的
I think they'll let you off for this.

420
00:40:06,785 --> 00:40:08,993
真的 非常感谢
Really, thank you so much.

421
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,743
没事的
It's okay.

422
00:40:14,785 --> 00:40:17,160
幸好他们让你逍遥法外
Good thing they let you get away with it.

423
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:20,702
他真的很生气 不是吗？
He was really mad, wasn't he?

424
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:23,785
这对我的家庭很重要
This was really important to my family.

425
00:41:13,243 --> 00:41:14,993
你的校服很好看
Your school uniform looks great.

426
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,493
非常感谢你
Thank you very much.

427
00:41:18,827 --> 00:41:21,035
我们买了全新的
We bought it brand new.

428
00:41:21,202 --> 00:41:23,577
从现在开始我要穿它
I'm going to wear it from now on.

429
00:41:23,827 --> 00:41:27,202
马弘 你真的长大了
Mahiro, you're really growing up.

430
00:41:28,327 --> 00:41:30,702
你穿起来真好看
It looks really good on you.

431
00:41:30,868 --> 00:41:32,368
谢谢您
Thank you.

432
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,827
有点大 但是
It's a little bit big, but...

433
00:41:37,243 --> 00:41:38,618
可能是
Could it be...

434
00:41:40,077 --> 00:41:43,577
你穿着它只是为了给我看？
that you're wearing it just to show me?

435
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:46,493
谢谢您
Thank you.

436
00:41:51,827 --> 00:41:54,160
听着 这是我为你做的
Look, I made this for you.

437
00:41:56,118 --> 00:41:57,660
那太好了！
That's great!

438
00:42:01,577 --> 00:42:03,118
我会好好照顾它的
I'll take good care of it.

439
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:08,285
它很精致 所以要小心
It's delicate, so be careful.

440

我想你可以给她更多的自由

但她说她摆姿势

486
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:51,285
就像在巴厘岛的海滩上

我记得那个海滩

493

马弘说是在巴厘岛

494

495
00:45:17,243 --> 00:45:18,577

00:57:15,105 --> 00:57:16,646
不会有事的
It's going to be okay.

584
00:57:21,105 --> 00:57:23,521
马弘 你才12岁
Mahiro, you're only 12.

585
00:57:25,021 --> 00:57:26,521
你到了一个年龄
You're coming to an age...

586
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:30,605
从现在开始
where from now on

587
00:57:31,313 --> 00:57:33,980
你会经历很多心痛
you're going to experience a lot of heartache.

588
00:57:35,146 --> 00:57:38,146
有时候 我们都是隐形的
Sometimes, we are all invisible.

589
00:57:56,646 --> 00:58:00,063
欢迎来到亨纳酒店
Welcome to the Henn Na hotel.

590
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:06,063
欢迎来到亨纳酒店

593
00:58:21,688 --> 00:58:25,355
我的事业叫做家庭
My business is called Family Romance.

594
00:58:25,688 --> 00:58:28,313
我们专门雇佣家庭成员
We specialize in hiring out family members,

595
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,938
雇佣朋友
hiring out friends,

596
00:58:30,105 --> 00:58:33,855
无论客户喜欢什么
whichever the client prefers.

597
00:58:34,021 --> 00:58:37,980
基本上 我们提供人来满足客户的愿望
Basically, we provide people to fulfill the client's wishes.

598
00:58:38,146 --> 00:58:40,938
这就是我经营的公司类型
That's the type of company I run.

599
00:58:41,105 --> 00:58:46,938
但我对你们的机器人旅馆很感兴趣
But I'm interested in your robot hotel

600
00:58:47,105 --> 00:58:52,563
看看我们能不能在某种程度上
to see if we can use, to some degree,

601
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:55,605
我们自己的企业里的机器人
robotics in our own business.

602
00:58:56,063 --> 00:59:02,355
我想听听你是怎么创办机器人旅馆的
I wanted to hear about how you started the robot hotel.

603
00:59:02,938 --> 00:59:05,771
机器人的用途
The purpose of robots

604
00:59:06,646 --> 00:59:09,605
提升客户体验
is to enhance customer experience.

605
00:59:09,771 --> 00:59:12,396
他们不仅仅是为了帮助人们
They're not just to assist people,

606
00:59:12,563 --> 00:59:17,021
这也是为客户创造一个娱乐的世界
it's also about creating a world of entertainment for the customer.

607
00:59:17,188 --> 00:59:19,188
这就是这家酒店的理念
That's the concept of this hotel.

608
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:21,396
人类机器人就是这样
It's the case for the human robots

609
00:59:21,563 --> 00:59:24,980
但我们也有鱼机器人
but we also have fish robots.

610
00:59:25,146 --> 00:59:28,230
鱼机器人在这里纯粹是
The fish robots are here purely

611
00:59:28,396 --> 00:59:32,355
招待我们的顾客
to entertain our customers.

612
00:59:34,605 --> 00:59:38,396
在未来 你认为他们会有梦想吗？
In the future, do you think they will have dreams?

613
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:42,480
不可能知道
It is impossible to know

614
00:59:42,646 --> 00:59:44,646
他们的想法
what is in their minds.

615
00:59:48,271 --> 00:59:52,813
按一下按钮 说出你的名字
Press the button and say your name.

616
00:59:54,271 --> 00:59:56,063
石井由一

617
01:01:55,938 --> 01:01:59,063
下午好 今天好吗？
Good afternoon, how are you today?

618
01:02:12,021 --> 01:02:14,730
下午好 今天好吗？
Good afternoon, how are you today?

619
01:02:23,021 --> 01:02:25,980

按一下按钮 说出你的名字

621
01:02:42,438 --> 01:02:43,813
朱坤 我的朋友
Ju-kun, my friend.

622
01:02:45,271 --> 01:02:47,521
我最近睡不着觉
I haven't been able to sleep lately.

623
01:02:49,605 --> 01:02:53,313
不久前 我在公园
A while ago, I was at the park,

624
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:58,146
武士们用剑练习的地方
where samurai were practicing with swords.

625
01:02:58,313 --> 01:03:00,771
-哦 像是表演？-是的 没错
- Oh, like a performance? - Yeah, exactly.

626
01:03:16,938 --> 01:03:19,230
但在我的梦里
In my dream, though,

627
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:21,813
他们没有剑
they didn't have swords

628
01:03:22,188 --> 01:03:24,271
但却在进行仪式性的自杀
but were committing ritual suicide.

629
01:03:27,271 --> 01:03:30,563
所以在你的梦里 人们犯了seppuku
So in your dream, people are committing seppuku

630
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:31,980
但是没有剑吗？
but have no swords?

631
01:03:32,146 --> 01:03:33,271
是 啊
Yeah.

632
01:03:33,688 --> 01:03:35,063
还在死去
And still dying.

633
01:03:36,063 --> 01:03:38,563
最初 他们有假剑
Originally, they had fake swords

634
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:40,938
但在我的噩梦中 根本没有剑
but in my nightmare, there are no swords at all.

635
01:05:24,896 --> 01:05:26,438
这是相当宽敞的
This is quite spacious.

636
01:05:26,605 --> 01:05:29,521
是的 这是我们的大房间
Yes, this is our larger room

637
01:05:29,688 --> 01:05:32,021
但取决于哀悼者的数量
but depending on the number of mourners,

638
01:05:32,188 --> 01:05:34,063
我们可以改变尺寸
we can change the size.

639
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:36,438
我们也可以安排一个小组
We can arrange for a small group as well.

640
01:05:36,605 --> 01:05:39,813
如果您愿意的话 我们还有这个小一点的
We also have this smaller one, if you prefer.

641
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:43,105
至于后面的祭坛
As for the altar back here,

642
01:05:43,271 --> 01:05:46,230
我们有这个大的
we have this large one.

643
01:05:46,938 --> 01:05:48,021
我可以看看这个棺材吗？
May I see this coffin?

644
01:05:48,188 --> 01:05:49,271
是的 在这里
Yes, over here.

645
01:05:49,438 --> 01:05:51,146
它有多大？
How large is it?

646
01:05:51,688 --> 01:05:55,063
这具棺材长180厘米
This coffin is 180cm long.

647
01:05:56,646 --> 01:06:00,063
我需要185厘米
I'll need 185cm.

648
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:03,730
我们的尺寸可达210厘米
We have sizes up to 210cm.

649
01:06:04,605 --> 01:06:08,355
对于一个185厘米高的男性来说 这个会不会太紧了？
Would this one be too tight for a 185cm tall male?

650
01:06:08,521 --> 01:06:09,313
对
Yes.

651
01:06:10,438 --> 01:06:11,938
如果有人在呼吸
If a body was breathing,

652
01:06:12,105 --> 01:06:14,438
有人能注意到吗？
would anyone be able to notice?

653
01:06:15,021 --> 01:06:18,521
这通常不会发生
That doesn't usually happen.

654
01:06:18,688 --> 01:06:20,105
最近
Recently,

655
01:06:20,271 --> 01:06:23,646
人们一直在寻找经验
people have been seeking the experience

656
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:26,021
死而不死
of being dead without dying.

657
01:06:26,188 --> 01:06:29,980
这几乎成了一种趋势
It's almost becoming a trend.

658
01:06:31,105 --> 01:06:34,230
你能看见有人在这里哭吗？
Would you be able to see someone crying in here?

659
01:06:34,396 --> 01:06:36,938
在那里 你的情绪会隐藏起来
Deep in there, your emotions would be hidden.

660
01:06:40,188 --> 01:06:41,771
有可能进去吗？
Is it possible to get inside?

661
01:06:41,938 --> 01:06:46,313
是的 我们可以为您准备
Yes, we can prepare it for you.

662
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,355
你想试试吗？
Would you like to try it out?

663
01:06:48,521 --> 01:06:49,688
是的 当然
Yes, absolutely.

664
01:06:49,855 --> 01:06:53,188
那样的话 我会为你安排的
In that case, I'll have it set up for you.

665
01:07:17,688 --> 01:07:21,688
如果你不介意的话 请脱下你的鞋
Please take off your shoes, if you don't mind.

666
01:07:25,771 --> 01:07:26,855
我可以吗？
May I?

667
01:07:53,271 --> 01:07:54,688
这里很安静
It's very quiet in here.

668
01:07:54,855 --> 01:07:57,980
在你的坟墓里 一切都是沉默
In your grave, it's all silence.

669
01:08:49,730 --> 01:08:52,938
谢谢你和我一起去看神谕
Thank you for coming with me to see the Oracle.

670
01:08:54,355 --> 01:08:56,438
我一个人感到孤独
I was feeling lonesome by myself,

671
01:08:57,063 --> 01:09:00,313
所以我很高兴有一个可以信任的朋友
so I'm glad to have a friend I can trust.

672
01:09:01,521 --> 01:09:03,563
这就是你要付出的代价
It's what you're paying for.

673
01:09:03,938 --> 01:09:05,521
别担心
Don't worry about it.

674
01:09:25,230 --> 01:09:31,021
我觉得马弘有男朋友了
I have a feeling that Mahiro has a boyfriend.

675
01:09:31,188 --> 01:09:32,938
你听到什么了吗？
Have you heard anything?

676
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:34,813
-马弘？-是的
- Mahiro? - Yeah.

677
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:36,730
我不这么认为
I don't think so.

678
01:09:37,563 --> 01:09:39,438
我什么也没听说过
I've heard nothing about that.

679
01:09:53,605 --> 01:09:57,521
你能召唤灵魂吗
Are you able to invoke the spirit

680
01:09:57,688 --> 01:09:59,563
我前夫的？
of my previous husband?

681
01:10:00,313 --> 01:10:01,313
他叫什么名字？
What's his name?

682
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,813
我丈夫的名字叫太一
My husband's name was Taiichi.

683
01:10:04,313 --> 01:10:06,896
你一个人住吗？
Are you living alone?

684
01:10:07,063 --> 01:10:08,438
我有一个女儿
I have a daughter.

685
01:10:08,605 --> 01:10:09,980
哦 太好了
Oh, that's good.

686
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,313
从现在开始
From now on,

687
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:57,105
你一定要坚强

对你很重要的人

689
01:12:02,021 --> 01:12:04,105
在你的精神之旅中
On your spiritual voyage,

690
01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:08,438
勇往直前
forge ahead

找到你真正的幸福
and find your true happiness.

692
01:12:14,896 --> 01:12:20,646
至于你的孩子
As for your child...

693
01:12:21,605 --> 01:12:28,355
她应该住在国外的某个地方
she should live somewhere overseas.

694
01:12:30,188 --> 01:12:34,605
我宁愿你知道
I know you would rather

695
01:12:34,771 --> 01:12:40,355
她住在离你很近的地方
she lived somewhere close to you.

696
01:12:41,605 --> 01:12:44,188
拜托
Please...

697
01:12:47,605 --> 01:12:57,313
这就是我想告诉你的
That's what I wanted to tell you.

698
01:12:57,980 --> 01:13:03,230
一年之内 哪怕只有一次
In the span of a year, even if only once

699
01:13:04,355 --> 01:13:10,021
在亡灵节期间
during the Festival of the Dead...

700
01:13:11,021 --> 01:13:13,813
在此期间
During that time,

701
01:13:14,521 --> 01:13:18,855
你应该向你的祖先祈祷
you should pray to your ancestors.

702
01:13:26,938 --> 01:13:30,646
为你需要的东西祈祷
Pray for the things you need

703
01:13:30,813 --> 01:13:37,188
你很感激
and that you are grateful for.

704
01:13:37,855 --> 01:13:39,855
到了阴间
Reaching for the Netherworld,

705
01:13:40,563 --> 01:13:44,563
我希望你有很多有意义的时刻

711
01:15:36,146 --> 01:15:39,188
你跟死人说话了吗？
Did you speak with someone dead?

712
01:15:40,063 --> 01:15:40,980
不
No.

713
01:15:41,563 --> 01:15:44,188
我试着联系一个活着的人
I tried instead to reach someone alive.

714
01:15:45,396 --> 01:15:47,563
一个活着的人？

715
01:16:32,313 --> 01:16:34,355
马弘 我们骑那辆吧！
Mahiro, let's ride that one!

716
01:16:35,146 --> 01:16:36,855
看起来很有趣！

717
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:39,521
我求你了！
I'm begging you!

01:16:40,230 --> 01:16:41,396
一个人骑
Ride it alone.

719
01:16:41,563 --> 01:16:44,105
为什么？你爸爸想骑它！

720

723
01:16:52,063 --> 01:16:53,563
没有机会
Not a chance.

724
01:16:53,730 --> 01:16:56,521
我要吐了
I'll throw up.

725
01:16:56,688 --> 01:16:57,605
你会害怕的
You can be scared.

726
01:16:57,771 --> 01:16:58,855
我不害怕！

727
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:01,688
但我会吐的

728

最近 马弘一直在说

729
01:18:35,771 --> 01:18:39,063
她爱我
that she loves me.

730
01:18:40,188 --> 01:18:41,396
前几天
The other day,

731
01:18:42,105 --> 01:18:45,813
我和马弘在一个摄影棚里照相
Mahiro and I took pictures in a booth.

732

马弘说

在周末 她想和我呆在一起

她说她几乎不占地方

737
01:19:14,521 --> 01:19:16,605
我们需要面对事实

738
01:19:20,563 --> 01:19:23,896
这太过分了 不是吗？
This is going too far, isn't it?

739
01:19:26,938 --> 01:19:28,730
如果我们继续

740
01:19:34,396 --> 01:19:37,855
在家庭恋情

741

我们不允许去爱

742
01:19:43,855 --> 01:19:45,230
被爱或被爱
or to be loved.

743
01:19:48,605 --> 01:19:49,980
所以
So...

744

我需要更加小心

745

你就不能和我们一起住吗？

我很高兴听到

747
01:20:04,271 --> 01:20:05,938
但我做不到
but that I cannot do.

748
01:20:07,063 --> 01:20:11,021
这是客厅 在那边 厨房
This is the living room. Over there, the kitchen.

749
01:20:11,188 --> 01:20:13,271
你可以全部使用
You can use it all.

750
01:20:15,688 --> 01:20:17,563
这是一个很好的提议
That's a lovely offer...

751
01:20:19,188 --> 01:20:20,896
但我真的不应该
but I really shouldn't.

752
01:20:24,730 --> 01:20:26,313
这里也有游泳池

一起游泳就好了
It would be nice to swim together.

754
01:20:30,063 --> 01:20:33,188
我想我们可以成为一个真正的家庭

755
01:20:40,896 --> 01:20:43,271
这就是马弘的房间

这是我的房间
This is my room.

758
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:54,563
你可以在这里用任何你喜欢的东西

759
01:20:55,188 --> 01:20:57,938
你为什么不看看会是什么感觉？
Why don't you see what it would feel like?

760
01:21:01,438 --> 01:21:03,146
我想
I think...

761
01:21:04,688 --> 01:21:06,855
我们不应该再这样下去了
we shouldn't continue this.

762
01:21:10,021 --> 01:21:11,521
不是更好
Wouldn't it be better...

763
01:21:12,521 --> 01:21:14,605
如果我死了？

前几天 我去了一家殡仪馆

765

767

你应该租一个死人

768
01:21:40,271 --> 01:21:41,938
我真的很抱歉
I'm really sorry.

769
01:21:46,563 --> 01:21:47,730

我认为这是一家令人难以置信的公司

779
01:22:50,396 --> 01:22:52,188
