of the dragon.

and my arms like this,
and I kept the mouth open.

Then I took my sword,
and I plunged it
through his tongue...

and hit all the way down
to his throat.
[Grunts]

And the dragon
wanted to spit fire,

but he couldn't
because of my sword.

And then all the fire
went into his sinuses,
and then he had to sneeze.

00:38:23,833 --> 00:38:25,949
And so he wanted
an antihistamine,

ask for antihistamine
because he couldn't talk.

And then I saw him become puffy,

And then he sneezed, boom,

and he sneezed me
out of his mouth.

who got me into all this.

They're the cutest kids

Because when an Italian
cheats on his fiancée,

he doesn't get married
and have two kids.

1205

make me break out

the way you care about Paolo.

I'd like someone
who would just break my heart
if I ever lost her.

1215
01:21:19,167 --> 01:21:21,249
It's very hard to find.

for a while,

1223
01:21:48,958 --> 01:21:51,666
make him suffer,
but then find a way back.

you could make some woman
feel really special.
