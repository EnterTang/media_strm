从前有一个女巫

7
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:57,559
他们住在我们世界的边界

8
00:00:57,559 --> 00:00:58,643

她曾经绑架过孩子

派她忠实的仆人

11
00:01:05,692 --> 00:01:07,318
半鸟半人无情

12
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:11,865
纳夫们把孩子们引到女巫的巢穴里
The Navs lured the children to the witch's den

13
00:01:11,865 --> 00:01:13,491

14
00:01:14,451 --> 00:01:16,745
父母忘记了他们的孩子

15
00:01:17,704 --> 00:01:20,248
好像他们从未存在过
as if they had never existed.

16
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:25,045
但是一个有着纯洁和光明灵魂的男孩

19
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:33,344
然而 女巫并没有放弃
However, the witch didn't give up.

20
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:35,472
她开始找人
She began to look for someone

21

谁会帮她回来

23
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,065

00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:57,327
对那个女巫的记忆只停留在童话里

你想有点隐私吗？

438
00:55:43,425 --> 00:55:45,135
-这不关你的事

不是我拖她来的

-但你让我们跟着你

468
01:01:26,934 --> 01:01:29,228
-大沙？-怎么回事？

469
01:01:29,228 --> 01:01:30,855
我们不在家

这不是我们的世界

-没人见过女巫

她不能离开她的巢穴

487
01:05:37,727 --> 01:05:41,272
有可怕的隐形鸟把孩子带到她身边

488
01:05:42,607 --> 01:05:43,566

他们能感觉到记忆的味道
They can sense the smell of memories

492
01:06:03,836 --> 01:06:05,546
就像捕食者感觉到血一样

保持你最明亮的记忆是很重要的

只要人们记住我们 我们就一直活着

森林晚上很危险 海军可以抓住你
The forest is dangerous at night the Navs can catch you.

502
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:00,309
躲起来！
Hide!

503
01:07:06,065 --> 01:07:09,986
别离开避难所 这件斗篷能掩盖你的气味

别害怕
Don't be scared.

521
01:10:33,564 --> 01:10:36,233
你抵抗得越多 他们就越紧张
The more you resist, the stronger they tighten up.

522
01:10:37,651 --> 01:10:40,404
我们可以趁女巫不饿的时候逃走

-那是不可能的 除非
- That's impossible. Unless...

545
01:14:25,337 --> 01:14:26,380
一旦你死了

546
01:14:27,714 --> 01:14:30,426
你就是女巫要找的人
