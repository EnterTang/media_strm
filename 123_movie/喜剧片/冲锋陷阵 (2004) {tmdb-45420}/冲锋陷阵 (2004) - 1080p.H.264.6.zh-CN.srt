00:00:43,446 --> 00:00:46,000


3
00:00:48,351 --> 00:00:51,044


4
00:00:56,823 --> 00:01:00,054
In Virginia.High-school football is a way of life.

5
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:02,117
It's bigger than Christmas Day.

6
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:06,791
My daddy coached in Alexandria. He worked so hard. My mama left him.

7
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:11,166
But I stayed with Coach. He needed me on that field.

8
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:17,066
Up until 1971. in Alexandria there was no race mixing.

9
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:19,543
Then the school board forced us to integrate.

10
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:22,638
They combined the white school and the black school into one.

11
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:25,980
Called T. C. Williams High School.

12
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,000


13
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,000


14
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:41,696
That summer. A black teenager was killed by a white store owner.

15
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,635
And the city was on the verge of exploding.

16
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,272
You've caused enough damage. This is my store.

17
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:55,212
Move left! Move left! Hut. Hut!

18
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,381
Come on. Kurt. Don't let Ray back you down like that. You're twice his size!

19
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:06,323
Oh! What are they doing? If they keep on playing like that. We'll lose every game!

20
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:07,825
I didn't think that was so bad.

21
00:02:11,736 --> 00:02:14,227
That's good. Gerry. I can see you've been working.

22
00:02:14,305 --> 00:02:18,833
Thanks a lot. Coach. Um. Listen. With the schools integrating and all.

23
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,470
Some of the guys are worried about losing their starting positions.

24
00:02:21,546 --> 00:02:23,741
That's something that we're gonna have to figure out.

25
00:02:23,815 --> 00:02:27,774
But you don't worry about that now. You just keep at it. All right?

26
00:02:27,852 --> 00:02:29,251
Yes. Coach.

27
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:34,149
Guys! Guys! It's coming down.

28
00:02:34,225 --> 00:02:36,284
It's coming down at the store!

29
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:39,159
They wanna burn the place up 'cause that colored kid got shot.

30
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,199
Come on. Man. Let's go.

31
00:02:42,267 --> 00:02:43,700
Hey! Come on. Guys!

32
00:02:43,768 --> 00:02:45,929
Hey!

33
00:02:46,304 --> 00:02:49,569
Coach. Just get Sheryl to the school now. Herb.

34
00:02:53,511 --> 00:02:56,708
Burn it down! Burn it down!

35
00:03:00,988 --> 00:03:02,580
Get in the truck.

36
00:03:02,657 --> 00:03:04,955
Gerry. Alan. Ray.

37
00:03:05,026 --> 00:03:09,122
If you ever wanna play for me again. Get in the truck. Now.

38
00:03:09,864 --> 00:03:13,732
You boys are gonna cool off. Come to my office. Help me finish packing my things.

39
00:03:13,801 --> 00:03:15,826
Gerry. Son. Your heart's in the right place.

40
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:18,235
But you oughta know better than to embarrass the coach like that.

41
00:03:18,306 --> 00:03:20,069
Hell. Why don't you just kick 'em all off the team?

42
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:24,544
I don't wanna play with any of those black animals. What? I see him.

43
00:03:24,612 --> 00:03:26,102
Who are you?

44
00:03:26,147 --> 00:03:28,638
I'm Herman Boone. I'm the new assistant coach.

45
00:03:28,716 --> 00:03:33,244
Well. From the looks of things I'd say we got about all the help we need around here.

46
00:03:33,321 --> 00:03:36,518
Why ain't you outside there with all your little friends. Hollering?

47
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:45,927
This was the time that was arranged for me to meet with Coach Yoast.

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,333
I never miss an appointment. Well. Maybe. Um...

49
00:03:49,404 --> 00:03:51,167
Maybe you just better reschedule.

50
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,003
Coach Boone. The school board made the decision to put you on my staff.

51
00:03:54,075 --> 00:03:58,774
I did not hire you. Well. I came up here to coach at G.W.

52
00:03:58,846 --> 00:04:02,976
I didn't ask the schools to redistrict. I didn't ask to be assigned to your staff.

53
00:04:03,051 --> 00:04:05,383
So I guess we're both in a situation we don't want to be in.

54
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,819
But I can guarantee you this. Coach.

55
00:04:08,322 --> 00:04:09,812
I come to win.

56
00:04:09,891 --> 00:04:15,386
Win? Coach Yoast has been nominated to the Virginia High School Hall of Fame.

57
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,795
15 winning seasons.

58
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:20,497
Well. I won a couple titles down in North Carolina.

59
00:04:20,568 --> 00:04:24,834
That's double-A ball. This here's Virginia. We play triple-A.

60
00:04:24,906 --> 00:04:27,932
What an opportunity for me then...

61
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:30,000
to learn...

62
00:04:30,078 --> 00:04:32,046
...from the best.

63
00:04:32,113 --> 00:04:35,014
"Marvin Gaye" - "I Heard it Through the Grapevine"

64
00:04:36,383 --> 00:04:40,820
- Are those people the movers?  - No. Looks like they're moving in here.

65
00:04:40,887 --> 00:04:42,946
Lord. How many of them are there?

66
00:04:43,022 --> 00:04:46,014
Only takes one. Then we're gonna be overrun by 'em.

67
00:04:46,926 --> 00:04:48,826
Mommy. Where you taking my teddy bear?

68
00:04:48,895 --> 00:04:52,228
Come on. Y'all. Oh. Ho-ho.

69
00:04:52,298 --> 00:04:56,200
Where is everybody? Nicky. Yes.

70
00:04:56,269 --> 00:04:58,329
Look there. Here comes some more of 'em.

71
00:04:59,206 --> 00:05:03,309
Well. That's Dr. Day. That negro from the school board. What's he doing here?

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,772
The school board has decided that Negro Herman Booneis gonna be the head coach at T.C.

73
00:05:08,146 --> 00:05:10,180
It's not fair! My daddy's head coach!

74
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:15,300
- This is gonna be his Hall of Fame year.- No one is trying to take away your daddy's future place in the Hall.

75
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,555
You can't just walk in here and take my daddy's job away!

76
00:05:18,593 --> 00:05:22,154
That is enough. Sheryl. That's enough.

77
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:27,859
Sheryl! Oh!

78
00:05:30,305 --> 00:05:33,832
It's all right. I feel the same way.

79
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:37,606
It's those agitators and race-mixers I feel like taking a swat at.

80
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:40,273
Troublemakers in the Berg are ready to put a torch to the city.

81
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:44,012
You want us to burn up like Watts?

82
00:05:44,086 --> 00:05:47,453
Every head coach in the system is white. We had to give them something.

83
00:05:47,523 --> 00:05:49,514
It's the world we live in. God help us all.

84
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:56,284
I left North Carolina because I was passed over for a job that I had righrfully earned.

85
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,892
Gave it to a white coach down therecouldn't even tie up his own football cleats.

86
00:05:59,983 --> 00:06:04,022
Now you are asking me to do the same thing to this man? I can't do that.

87
00:06:05,221 --> 00:06:07,280
Herman?

88
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:11,983
Folks in Carolina say you marched with Dr. King.

89
00:06:12,061 --> 00:06:15,224
Say you stood toe-to-toe with the Klan.

90
00:06:15,298 --> 00:06:18,825
Said you're a race man. That's right. I'm also a family man.

91
00:06:19,536 --> 00:06:23,768
Coach Boone. Black folks have never had anything in this city to call their own

92
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,705
except humiliation and despair.

93
00:06:25,775 --> 00:06:30,144
Dr. Day. Excuse me. Herman. I think that you better look outside.

94
00:06:31,414 --> 00:06:34,178
(applause. Cheering)

95
00:06:45,929 --> 00:06:50,423
So you see. We need you. Coach Boone. Come on.

96
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:55,399
Coach Boone. I'm Charles Campbell. This here is my boy. Julius.

97
00:06:55,471 --> 00:06:59,237
He can be the finest defensive end in the whole state if you push him to it.

98
00:06:59,309 --> 00:07:01,971
I heard a lot about your boy. You're like a answer to our prayers.

99
00:07:02,045 --> 00:07:03,979
Wait a minute. Now. I'm not an answer to your prayers.

100
00:07:04,047 --> 00:07:09,883
I'm not a savior or Jesus Christ. Martin Luther King or the Easter Bunny.

101
00:07:09,953 --> 00:07:13,081
I'm a football coach. That's all. Just a football coach.

102
00:07:13,156 --> 00:07:16,785
You're our coach. You're our coach!

103
00:07:22,232 --> 00:07:27,226
Boone! Boone! Boone!...

104
00:07:27,403 --> 00:07:30,133
(knocking)

105
00:07:37,046 --> 00:07:38,536
What do you want?

106
00:07:40,316 --> 00:07:43,012
Is Coach Yoast here? We're busy.

107
00:07:43,086 --> 00:07:45,782
Interviewing for head-coaching jobs.

108
00:07:45,855 --> 00:07:49,382
Got 11 offers and certainly no time for you.

109
00:07:59,702 --> 00:08:03,798
Well. Come on in. I've got an office out back.

110
00:08:04,407 --> 00:08:08,673
Look. I can't even spell diplomacy and I'm sorry about the way things went down.

111
00:08:08,745 --> 00:08:13,205
But make no mistake. I am qualified to be this school's head coach.

112
00:08:13,283 --> 00:08:16,582
Well. Sure. You've been in. What. Four or five programs in the past ten years?

113
00:08:16,653 --> 00:08:19,713
With four or five championships. This isn't about me.

114
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:24,920
- I'm worried about my boys. - I ain't gonna cook 'em and eat 'em.

115
00:08:24,994 --> 00:08:27,963
The best player will play. Color won't matter.

116
00:08:28,031 --> 00:08:32,468
From the looks of our little situation we got us here. I'd say it's about all that does.

117
00:08:32,535 --> 00:08:36,699
Yeah. You're right. We in a tough spot. Coach. You. Me. The whole city.

118
00:08:36,773 --> 00:08:40,800
I think that it would go a long way to smooth things over if you would stay.

119
00:08:40,877 --> 00:08:45,905
Work on the staff. Be a defensive coordinator. Assistant head coach.

120
00:08:45,982 --> 00:08:50,419
Work under you? If that's the way you see it.

121
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:56,757
Good night. Coach.

122
00:09:00,563 --> 00:09:04,932
It's been a rare privilege to have lived here as long as I have. Coaching your boys.

123
00:09:05,468 --> 00:09:08,198
I'll be taking the year off...No.

124
00:09:08,271 --> 00:09:11,365
...after which I'll be moving to Loudon

125
00:09:11,441 --> 00:09:14,933
and taking the head-coaching job at Loudon High.

126
00:09:15,011 --> 00:09:17,844
Don't go. Coach! I say boycott T.C. Williams.

127
00:09:17,914 --> 00:09:19,006
Tell 'em. Fred.

128
00:09:19,082 --> 00:09:21,516
Our boys aren't playing for some Coach Coon.

129
00:09:21,584 --> 00:09:25,520
Coach. He stole your job. I'm not playing for him.

130
00:09:25,588 --> 00:09:27,749
I started a petition and I'm sitting this season out.

131
00:09:27,824 --> 00:09:32,352
Only place you're gonna sit is right back in that chair. Gerry. I appreciate it. Though.

132
00:09:32,428 --> 00:09:36,364
Boycott T. C! Boycott the school! Stop this. Fred.

133
00:09:36,432 --> 00:09:40,232
You know none of these boys can afford to go to some other district just to play ball.

134
00:09:40,303 --> 00:09:43,795
They sit this one out. They put their futures on the line.

135
00:09:43,873 --> 00:09:47,001
Coach. I'm out too. I'm not playing for no thief.

136
00:09:47,076 --> 00:09:51,012
Don't do this. Don't make this any harder for me than it already is.

137
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,516
Coach. If you go. I go.I only play for you. Coach Yoast.

138
00:09:54,584 --> 00:09:56,814
Don't go. Coach.You can't leave us.

139
00:09:56,886 --> 00:10:01,653
Coach Yoast! Coach Yoast! Coach Yoast! Coach Yoast! Couch Yoast!

140
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:07,993
We'll be all right, Coach.

141
00:10:10,061 --> 00:10:12,774
I've coached most of these boys since they were your age.

142
00:10:12,774 --> 00:10:15,488
I've seen them grow up in front of my eyes,almost like they were my own kids.

143
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,539
Almost.

144
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:23,718
This is a heck of a time to be abandoning them to look out for themselves. Ain't it?

145
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,485
So. What are you gonna do?

146
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,887
We gonna play some ball. Y'all.

147
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:35,127
Black inside. Black inside. Black inside. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh!

148
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:38,534
Hey. Yo. Petey. How many yards you figure you gonna get this season. Bro?

149
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:43,166
You know I ain't one to brag. Big Blue. But I figure on at least a thousand.

150
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:44,402
"I ain't one to brag."

151
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,968
Didn't I tell you how them white boys weren't gonna play for no brother?

152
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,844
Well. Who needs 'em. Baby? From now on.

153
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:52,407
The Titans is gonna be powered by soul power. Bro.

154
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:56,854
He said soul power

155
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:57,981
(whistle)

156
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,046
Shut up.

157
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,788
Wait. Shh!

158
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:12,032
Put your hand down.

159
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:15,274
- You smilin'? - Yes.

160
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,273
- Yes. Sir. - Yes. Sir.

161
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:20,711
- Why are you smiling? - 'Cause I love football. Football is fun.

162
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,974
- Fun. Sir. - Fun. Sir.

163
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:22,844
- It's fun? - Yes.

164
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,542
- You sure?-  I think...

165
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:27,108
Now you're thinking. First you smile. Then you're thinkin'?

166
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:30,281
- You think football is still fun? - Uh... yes.

167
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,721
Sir. Yes. No...

168
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,122
- No?...sir. Sir. Uh...

169
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,626
Well. It was fun. Not anymore. Though. Is it?

170
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,684
Is it? Not right now.

171
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:39,094
No. It's not fun anymore. Not even a little bit.

172
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,564
Uh... no.

173
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:41,793
- Make up your mind. Think. - No. No.

174
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,767
Since you thinkin' now. Go on. Think. Is it fun?

175
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:44,598
- No. Sir. - No?

176
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,160
- No. Sir. - Absolutely not?

177
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:49,503
- Zero fun. Sir. All right. - Listen up. I'm Coach Boone.

178
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:55,944
I'm gonna tell you all about how much "fun" you gonna have this season.

179
00:11:56,015 --> 00:12:02,011
We leave for camp. Gettysburg College. August 15th. 7:29am.

180
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:06,855
If you report at 7:30. you will not be playing football this season. You will be watching.

181
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,417
You will wear a jacket. Shirt and tie.

182
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:13,556
If you don't have one. Buy one. Can't afford one. Then borrow one from your old man.

183
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:18,331
If you don't have an old man. Then find a drunk. Trade him for his.

184
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,463
'Cause I can guarantee you there isn't a bum on the street

185
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:23,474
that looks as raggedy and ridiculous as what I'm looking at right now.

186
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:26,375
This is no democracy.

187
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:28,504
It is a dictatorship.

188
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,776
I am the law.

189
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,913
If you survive camp. You will be on the team.

190
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:38,081
If you survive.

191
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,849
- Check 'em in. Coach. - Checkin' 'em in.

192
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,259
I'm Coach Hinds. Your offensive line coach.

193
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,821
Yell out your name and positions. Starting from the right.

194
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:50,563
Petey Jones. Running back. The running back. Y'all.

195
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:53,036
Whatever. Petey! Get outta here.

196
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:59,834
Jerry Harris. Quarterback. Hallelujah! Hallelujah. Rev.

197
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,244
- Rev? - It's just a nickname.

198
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,809
And who in the name of heaven might you be?

199
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:09,343
I'm Louie Lastik. Offensive lineman.

200
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:11,822
Naval family. Just moved here from Bayonne.

201
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:16,885
Someone said football. So I come runnin'. What's going on. Everybody?

202
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,721
(door opens)

203
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:31,107
With him calling the shots. Ain't none of us gonna see nothin' but the bench this year.

204
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:34,510
He ain't callin' the shots. You'll play.

205
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:46,750
You have just disrupted my first team meeting in an unacceptable fashion.

206
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,454
This is my team now. Either you're with that or you're not.

207
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,723
I'm here. Ain't I? Let's talk football.

208
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,765
Let's talk football. I run the defense...

209
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,564
As a part of my team strategy.

210
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:01,333
I have never seen an assistant coach's name in the newspaper for losing a game.

211
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,535
I want a job for Coach Tyrell. He's been with me for ten years.

212
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,068
I won't leave him out in the cold. You don't get me without him.

213
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:12,777
You're overcooking my grits. Coach. All right.

214
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:18,051
I will allow Coach Tyrell to coach a special team.

215
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,752
But I will have my eye on him...

216
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,589
...and you.

217
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:28,122
"Charles Wright & The Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band"-"Express Yourself"

218
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,464
Good morning. Good morning. Coaches. How are you?

219
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,164
Good morning to you. Looks good today. Doesn't it?

220
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,605
Just wanted to let you know what the offense is doing.

221
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:40,804
That's an awful skinny playbook. Ain't it? Well. I run six plays. Split veer.

222
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,576
It's like Novocain. Just give it time. Always works.

223
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,776
See you on the bus.

224
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,819
Be patient. Bill. Your time will come.

225
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,186
Herman. Here we go. Here we go.

226
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:55,954
How can I help you boys?

227
00:14:56,028 --> 00:15:00,328
I'm Gerry Bertier. The only all-American you got on this team.

228
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:02,627
You want any of us to play for you.

229
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:05,329
You reserve half the open positions for Hammond players.

230
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,099
Half the offense. Half the special teams.

231
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:10,472
We don't need any of your people on defense. We're already set.

232
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,135
Uh-huh. Don't need none of my people. Mm-hm.

233
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:14,873
What'd you say your name was? Uh. Jerry?

234
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,278
Gerry.

235
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:21,980
No. You must have said Jerry. Like Lewis. Which would make you Dean Martin. Right?

236
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,750
Ladies and gentlemen. I've got an announcement to make.

237
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:29,726
We got Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin going to camp with us here this year.

238
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:34,198
Jerry tells the jokes. Dean sings the songs and gets the girl.

239
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,724
Let's give 'em a round of applause.

240
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:47,440
Where's your folks. Gerry? Parents. Are they here?

241
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,811
Where are they?

242
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,782
- That's my mother. - That's your mama?

243
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,182
Mm-hm. Very nice.

244
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,915
Take a good look at her.

245
00:15:56,989 --> 00:16:00,686
'Cause once you get on that bus. You ain't got no mama no more.

246
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,217
You got your brothers on the team. And you got your daddy.

247
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:07,697
Now you know who your daddy is. Don't you?

248
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:11,862
Gerry. If you want to play on this football team. You answer me when I ask you:

249
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:14,667
Who is your daddy?

250
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:18,102
Who's your daddy. Gerry?

251
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,168
Who's your daddy?

252
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:25,544
You. Uh-huh. And whose team is this?

253
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:30,521
Is this your team? Or is this your daddy's team?

254
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:35,117
Yours. Mm-hm. Get on the bus.

255
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:39,096
Put your jacket on first. And get on the bus.

256
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,765
Uh. Dean.

257
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,103
Fix that tie. Son.

258
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:03,110
All right. Listen up. Listen up. I want everybody off the bus.

259
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,487
Let's go. Follow me. Everybody. Let's go. Right now.

260
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:09,721
Why we gotta get off the bus?What are they doin'. Man?

261
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,888
All right. Everybody off the bus.

262
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:15,331
Listen up. I don't care if you're black. Green. Blue. White or orange.

263
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:18,268
I want all of my defensive players on this side.

264
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:21,738
All players going out for offense over here. Right now.

265
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:24,401
Let's move. Let's move. Let's move. Let's move!

266
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:27,741
You and you. Offensive bus. Sit together.

267
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:31,943
You and you. Defensive bus. Sit together. Get comfortable. Too.

268
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,508
Because the person that I have you sitting next to

269
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:39,354
is the same one that you'll be rooming with for the duration of this camp.

270
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:49,561
'Cause. Baby. There ain't no mountain high enough

271
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:53,435
Ain't no valley low enough

272
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:56,201
Ain't... Blue. Shut up.

273
00:17:56,275 --> 00:18:01,008
I don't want to see your smilin' and shufflin' minstrel-show singing on this bus.

274
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,809
You. Too.

275
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,674
Got that right.

276
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:10,519
You can shut up. Too.

277
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,820
"Norman Greenbaum" - "Spirit in the Sky"

278
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,967
When I die and they lay me to rest

279
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,030
That's my bed.

280
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,772
Gonna go to the place that's the best

281
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,644
When I lay me down to die

282
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,444
And that's his bed.

283
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,800
Going up to the spirit in the sky

284
00:18:43,813 --> 00:18:46,053
I ain't looking at that for two weeks. Man. Take it down.

285
00:18:46,996 --> 00:18:48,155
That's where I'm gonna go when I die

286
00:18:48,934 --> 00:18:51,494
You can close your eyes for two weeks for all I care.

287
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,504
Why don't you look at your wall and I'll look at mine.

288
00:18:53,572 --> 00:18:57,338
I'll look wherever I want to. And I don't want to be looking at that for two weeks.

289
00:18:57,409 --> 00:18:59,843
Then you better use your x-ray vision. Superman.

290
00:18:59,912 --> 00:19:02,608
And look right through it. 'Cause it ain't coming down.

291
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:13,948
Fight!

292
00:19:14,993 --> 00:19:16,187
Fight!

293
00:19:16,962 --> 00:19:19,726
Hey. Hey. Hey. Fight! Who is it?

294
00:19:26,141 --> 00:19:28,132
Bunch of tough guys.

295
00:19:29,744 --> 00:19:34,272
You look like a bunch of fifth-grade sissies after a cat fight.

296
00:19:35,317 --> 00:19:38,377
You got anger. That's good. You're gonna need it. Son.

297
00:19:38,453 --> 00:19:40,785
You got aggression. That's even better. You're gonna need that. Too.

298
00:19:40,856 --> 00:19:44,553
But any little two-year-old child can throw a fit.

299
00:19:44,626 --> 00:19:48,619
Football is about controlling that anger.

300
00:19:48,697 --> 00:19:53,657
Harnessing that aggression into a team effort to achieve perfection.

301
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:59,037
Some coaches. They cut a player if they think he's not up to snuff.

302
00:19:59,107 --> 00:20:01,598
Or they think he's hurting the team.

303
00:20:01,643 --> 00:20:03,338
This is a public-school program.

304
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:07,370
I will never ever cut a player who comes out to play for me.

305
00:20:07,449 --> 00:20:12,213
But when you put that uniform on. That Titan uniform. You better come to work.

306
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:18,086
We will be perfect...

307
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,686
...in every aspect of the game. You drop a pass. You run a mile.

308
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:24,061
You miss a blocking assignment. You run a mile.

309
00:20:24,132 --> 00:20:25,622
You fumble the football.

310
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:30,764
And I will break my foot off in your John Brown hindparts.

311
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:34,468
And then you will run a mile. Perfection.

312
00:20:37,145 --> 00:20:38,373
Let's go to work.

313
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:40,437
Hit! Hit!

314
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:42,682
Come on. Move. Move. Move. Move those feet.

315
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:47,688
Get up. Boy! Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up!

316
00:20:47,756 --> 00:20:49,553
Keep that head up. Keep those heads up!

317
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:51,592
Keep those feet moving!

318
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,959
Everything we gonna do is change. We are change.

319
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:58,830
We gonna change the way we run. We gonna change the way we eat.

320
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,868
We gonna change the way we block!

321
00:21:00,936 --> 00:21:02,961
We gonna change the way we tackle!

322
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,804
We gonna change the way we win! Defense is desire.

323
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,639
Fire and desire. Defense. Go! Come on!

324
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,611
Get up. Get outta here. Go run. Go!

325
00:21:19,424 --> 00:21:21,119
(grunting)

326
00:21:21,192 --> 00:21:22,420
(grunts)

327
00:21:22,494 --> 00:21:24,621
Keep those legs moving!

328
00:21:24,696 --> 00:21:25,856
Keep moving! Keep moving!

329
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,727
Keep that ball with you till you get out of the briar patch.

330
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:31,428
Show me. Son! Show me. 'Bama! Show me. 'Bama!

331
00:21:31,503 --> 00:21:35,098
Jump on that ball carrier like a starving man on a Christmas ham.

332
00:21:36,508 --> 00:21:40,569
Hut! To the left! Move your feet!

333
00:21:40,645 --> 00:21:41,703
Fumble. Fumble. Fumble!

334
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,010
What is wrong with you?! Why are you fumbling my football?

335
00:21:44,082 --> 00:21:45,379
My blockers were... Your blockers?

336
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,884
Your blockers ain't got nothing to do with you holding the ball!

337
00:21:47,952 --> 00:21:50,921
Did your blockers fumble the football or did you fumble the football?

338
00:21:50,989 --> 00:21:53,651
I did. Sir. All right. How many feet are in a mile?

339
00:21:53,725 --> 00:21:55,625
How many feet are in a mile?! I don't...

340
00:21:55,693 --> 00:21:58,218
5.280 feet.

341
00:21:58,296 --> 00:22:01,891
You pick this ball up. You run every one of 'em!

342
00:22:01,966 --> 00:22:05,732
You're killing me. Petey! You're killing me!

343
00:22:15,112 --> 00:22:16,738
What you doing, man?

344
00:22:18,214 --> 00:22:19,013
Eating lunch.

345
00:22:20,283 --> 00:22:23,349
I see you eating lunch.But why you eating over here?

346
00:22:23,522 --> 00:22:26,583
Why don't you go on over there and eat with your people?

347
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:30,000
Man, I don't have any people.I'm with everybody, Julius.

348
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,826
He's just alight-skinned brother.

349
00:22:32,368 --> 00:22:34,262
Yeah, and I'm a dark-skinned cracker.

350
00:22:35,863 --> 00:22:39,963
Come on, Julius, he's just another blessed child in God's loving family.

351
00:22:42,864 --> 00:22:43,964
Come on, Blue, let me...

352
00:22:48,217 --> 00:22:54,992
Lord, we come before you today and ask you to soften big Julius Campbell's heart.

353
00:22:55,388 --> 00:22:57,000
Look at that traitor.

354
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:02,200
And Rev? He better be praying I block for his black behind.

355
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:05,999
Yeah, but, Ray, if you don't blockyou're not gonna start.

356
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,500
I'll start. I'll just bide my time.

357
00:23:10,736 --> 00:23:16,040
I got some plays we won the city title with last year.Got some trick plays, some stuff that might...

358
00:23:16,607 --> 00:23:18,820
...fi re up the boys' imaginations a little bit.

359
00:23:20,221 --> 00:23:21,221
Trick plays?

360
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,600
I think unless the boys start having a little funthey're not gonna put points up on that board for you.

361
00:23:25,921 --> 00:23:28,547
You worry about your defense.Let me worry about the offense.

362
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,322
All right.

363
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:35,853
Lastik!

364
00:23:40,065 --> 00:23:43,863
I want you to tell me something about one of your black teammates.

365
00:23:43,868 --> 00:23:45,395
Sir, yes, sir!

366
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,233
I'm rooming with Blue, sir...

367
00:23:47,306 --> 00:23:48,568
...and I noticed he wears those leopard-spotted

368
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,247
under wears,bikini-style, sir!

369
00:23:51,475 --> 00:23:53,902
OK, maybe somebody who's not your roommate.

370
00:23:53,979 --> 00:23:56,675
Sir, I eat lunch with Rev.

371
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:57,676
That's Jerry Harris, sir!

372
00:23:58,735 --> 00:24:02,222
People call him Rev cause he's always praying,and he won't abide a foul tongue, sir!

373
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,212
And what is the Rev gonna do after high school?

374
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,223
I don't know.Go to college and all that, I guess.

375
00:24:09,224 --> 00:24:11,224
What about you? You gonna go to college?

376
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:12,661
Oh, not me, Coach.

377
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:14,204
I ain't a brainiac like Rev.

378
00:24:14,246 --> 00:24:15,789
Think you got a future in football?

379
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:18,834
Heck, no. I just figure if I got to be in school

380
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,836
I might as well hit some people while I'm at it.

381
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:24,381
All right, I like that.A self-aware man, I like that.

382
00:24:24,423 --> 00:24:28,802
But if you don't go to college,it's not gonna be because you're not qualified,

383
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:33,140
so I want you to bring me your test scores at the end of every week, and we'll go over them together, OK?

384
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:35,100
We'll keep that between you and me.

385
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:36,268
OK.

386
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:40,022
So, what kind of music does the Rev like?

387
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:41,690
Me and Rev both dig on The Temptations.

388
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:42,816
Oh, yeah?

389
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:44,902
I know you want to leave me

390
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:48,989
But I refuse to let you go

391
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:50,991
If I got to pray

392
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:53,118
Plead for your sympathy

393
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:58,685
I don't mind 'Cause you mean that much to me Ain't too proud to beg

394
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:01,168
OK, all right. Stop begging.

395
00:25:01,293 --> 00:25:03,545
Anybody else?

396
00:25:06,215 --> 00:25:08,175
No volunteers?

397
00:25:10,886 --> 00:25:12,012
Campbell?

398
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,892
Bertier?

399
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:20,479
No, huh?

400
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:28,195
Each one of you will spend time every day

401
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,948
with a teammate of a different race.

402
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:33,617
You will learn about him and his family,

403
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:35,202
his likes, his dislikes.

404
00:25:35,244 --> 00:25:38,080
You will report back to me

405
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:40,916
until you meet every one of your teammates.

406
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:44,628
Until that time, we go to 3-a-day practices.

407
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:49,508
You continue to ignore each other,we'll go to 4-a-daypractices.

408
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,802
Now, is there any part of this you don't understand?

409
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,930
Let's see. What's your daddy's name?

410
00:25:54,972 --> 00:25:56,932
I mean, you do have a daddy right?

411
00:25:56,974 --> 00:26:00,102
I have a father, and his name is Eric.

412
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:02,062
And what's he do?

413
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:04,273
Wait, he does have a job, right?

414
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:13,407
Huh? Yes! This one.

415
00:26:13,532 --> 00:26:15,826
I don't even have to ask, but I will.

416
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:17,286
What do you think of this one?

417
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:20,289
Does the term ''cruel and unusual punishment''

418
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:22,082
mean anything to you?

419
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:24,960
2 minutes to go in the game.

420
00:26:25,002 --> 00:26:26,670
The other team is out there, they're tired.

421
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:28,380
Fourth quarter. Fourth quarter.

422
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:32,843
Nobody from my family ever went to no college.

423
00:26:32,844 --> 00:26:33,886
I'll tutor you, Louie.

424
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:35,429
I'm white trash!

425
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:37,264
I ain't gonna get no C-plus grades!

426
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:42,311
I'm just down-home, no-good,never-goin'-to-no-college white trash, man!

427
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:45,105
Would you hurry up and get off the phone? I got to call my girl, too, man!

428
00:26:45,147 --> 00:26:46,440
Say it right now.

429
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:50,235
Oh, oh, don't do this right now.

430
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:52,446
Hey, man, what is this, Wild Kingdom?

431
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:53,572
Shut up, y'all!

432
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:55,282
Mating habits of the mountain gorillas?

433
00:26:55,348 --> 00:26:57,441
Gerry. You say it or I'm not hanging up the phone.

434
00:26:57,517 --> 00:26:58,677
Say it right now.

435
00:27:01,154 --> 00:27:04,749
I love you. Sugar. Ah-ha-ha! "I love you. Sugar"!

436
00:27:04,825 --> 00:27:06,952
(overlapping shouts)

437
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:16,802
Get him! Get him! Get him! Get him!

438
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:21,102
What are y'all doing? 44 stack. You're supposed to know your jobs.

439
00:27:21,174 --> 00:27:24,473
Campbell. You're playing selfish showoff football. Hold your man down!

440
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:27,513
Don't you single me out like that. What. You think I'm stupid or something?

441
00:27:27,581 --> 00:27:32,109
Listen. I'm the team captain and I don't need you up in my face all the time!

442
00:27:32,185 --> 00:27:34,881
We're here to play football. Y'all. Let's play football.

443
00:27:34,955 --> 00:27:36,582
(sighs)

444
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:38,783
Doc. I got it.

445
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:42,556
Y'all didn't come out here to practice. 'Cause champions pay the price.

446
00:27:42,629 --> 00:27:44,290
Lookin' like a bunch of bums out here.

447
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,500
Who's a coward? Cowards won't block!

448
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:51,468
Cowards won't tackle!

449
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,508
Cowards won't go after fumbles.

450
00:27:53,575 --> 00:27:57,040
Coach. We need a water break. We been out here all day.

451
00:27:57,045 --> 00:28:00,208
What did you say? I said we need a water break.

452
00:28:00,282 --> 00:28:03,718
You need a water break. Water is for cowards.

453
00:28:03,785 --> 00:28:05,275
Water makes you weak.

454
00:28:05,354 --> 00:28:09,484
Water is for washing blood off that uniform. And you don't get no blood on my uniform!

455
00:28:09,558 --> 00:28:12,618
Boy. You must be outside your mind! Hm.

456
00:28:12,694 --> 00:28:18,680
We are going to do updowns until Blue is no longer tired and thirsty!

457
00:28:28,978 --> 00:28:31,037
Coach!

458
00:28:36,018 --> 00:28:40,682
There's a fine line between tough and crazy. And you're flirting with it.

459
00:28:47,696 --> 00:28:49,254
All right. Get some water.

460
00:28:49,331 --> 00:28:51,731
Water! Water! Water!

461
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,030
I'll take that.

462
00:28:54,803 --> 00:28:58,864
Hey. Wait your turn. Boy! Who you calling a boy. Cracker?

463
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:02,777
Quit it. Jerks!

464
00:29:02,845 --> 00:29:05,712
Come on! You're all acting like a bunch of sissies!

465
00:29:05,781 --> 00:29:07,840
Quit it!

466
00:29:15,824 --> 00:29:19,885
All right. Man. Listen. I'm Gerry. You're Julius.

467
00:29:19,962 --> 00:29:23,227
Let's get some particulars and just get this over with. All right?

468
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:24,891
Particulars? Yeah.

469
00:29:24,967 --> 00:29:27,401
No matter what I tell you. You ain't gonna never know nothing about me.

470
00:29:27,469 --> 00:29:30,267
Listen. I ain't running anymore of these three-a-days. OK?

471
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:32,239
What I got to say you really don't want to hear.

472
00:29:32,308 --> 00:29:35,300
'Cause honesty ain't too high up on your people's priority list. Right?

473
00:29:35,377 --> 00:29:37,641
Honesty? You want honesty?

474
00:29:37,713 --> 00:29:41,410
All right. Honestly. I think you're nothing.

475
00:29:41,483 --> 00:29:43,644
Nothing but a pure waste of God-given talent.

476
00:29:43,719 --> 00:29:48,247
You don't listen to nobody. Man. Not even Doc or Boone!

477
00:29:48,324 --> 00:29:52,522
Shiver-push on the line every time. Man. You blow right past 'em!

478
00:29:52,595 --> 00:29:56,053
Push 'em! Pull 'em! Do something!

479
00:29:56,131 --> 00:29:57,860
You can't run over everybody in this league.

480
00:29:57,933 --> 00:30:01,300
And every time you do. You leave one of your teammates hanging out to dry.

481
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:05,773
Me in particular! Why should I give a hoot about you. Huh?

482
00:30:05,841 --> 00:30:08,833
Or anybody else out there? You want to talk about a waste?

483
00:30:08,911 --> 00:30:10,469
You're the captain. Right? Right.

484
00:30:10,546 --> 00:30:12,207
Captain's supposed to be the leader? Right.

485
00:30:12,281 --> 00:30:13,407
You got a job? I have a job.

486
00:30:13,482 --> 00:30:15,643
You been doing your job? I've been doing my job.

487
00:30:15,718 --> 00:30:18,687
Then why don't you tell your white buddies to block for Rev better.

488
00:30:18,754 --> 00:30:22,747
'Cause they have not blocked for him worth a plugged nickel and you know it!

489
00:30:22,825 --> 00:30:26,261
Nobody plays! Yourself included!

490
00:30:26,328 --> 00:30:31,356
I'm supposed to wear myself out for the "team"? What team?

491
00:30:31,433 --> 00:30:37,766
No. No. What I'm gonna do is. I'm gonna look out for myself and I'm gonna get mine.

492
00:30:38,707 --> 00:30:42,768
See. Man? That's the worst attitude I ever heard.

493
00:30:44,647 --> 00:30:48,640
Attitude reflects leadership. Captain.

494
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:53,352
(horn blaring)

495
00:30:56,825 --> 00:31:01,421
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go!

496
00:31:01,497 --> 00:31:05,797
Wake up. Gentlemen. It's late. It's 3am in the morning.

497
00:31:05,868 --> 00:31:07,529
All right. Listen up.

498
00:31:07,603 --> 00:31:11,266
You will follow Doc. Myself and the other coaches.

499
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,274
We're gonna take a little run through the woods.

500
00:31:13,342 --> 00:31:17,438
If you get lost along the way. Don't bother coming back to camp.

501
00:31:17,513 --> 00:31:21,005
Just hitchhike your hindparts on home. Any questions?

502
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:26,851
Coach. This is a high-school football team. We're not in the Marines here.

503
00:31:26,922 --> 00:31:28,787
Let's go.

504
00:31:30,392 --> 00:31:33,691
"Leon Russell" - "A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall"

505
00:31:36,732 --> 00:31:39,496
Tell me. Where have you been

506
00:31:39,568 --> 00:31:42,969
My blue-eyed son?

507
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:47,532
Where have you been. My darling young one?

508
00:31:49,378 --> 00:31:54,714
I've stumbled up on the side of twelve misty mountains

509
00:31:54,783 --> 00:31:59,948
I've walked and I've crawled over six crooked highways

510
00:32:00,022 --> 00:32:05,756
And it's hard... Yes. It's hard...

511
00:32:05,828 --> 00:32:08,160
Oh. No. No. Come on. Man. Can't take no rest.

512
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,720
Can't take no rest.

513
00:32:11,433 --> 00:32:13,799
A hard rain's

514
00:32:16,271 --> 00:32:18,398
A-gonna fall

515
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:28,343
Anybody know what this place is?

516
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:33,210
This is Gettysburg.

517
00:32:33,255 --> 00:32:36,554
This is where they fought the Battle of Gettysburg.

518
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:42,530
50.000 men died right here on this field.

519
00:32:42,598 --> 00:32:48,332
Fighting the same fight that we're still fighting amongst ourselves...

520
00:32:49,972 --> 00:32:51,633
...today.

521
00:32:51,707 --> 00:32:55,404
This green field right here was painted red.

522
00:32:55,477 --> 00:32:59,937
Bubbling with the blood of young boys.

523
00:33:00,015 --> 00:33:02,449
Smoke...

524
00:33:04,353 --> 00:33:08,585
...and hot lead pouring right through their bodies.

525
00:33:10,826 --> 00:33:12,623
Listen to their souls. Man.

526
00:33:12,694 --> 00:33:16,755
"I killed my brother with malice in my heart."

527
00:33:17,499 --> 00:33:22,095
"Hatred destroyed my family."

528
00:33:24,473 --> 00:33:25,963
You listen.

529
00:33:28,076 --> 00:33:30,874
And you take a lesson from the dead.

530
00:33:33,382 --> 00:33:36,442
If we don't come together...

531
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:40,480
...right now on this hallowed ground...

532
00:33:40,556 --> 00:33:43,616
...then we. Too. Will be destroyed.

533
00:33:45,527 --> 00:33:48,428
Just like they were.

534
00:33:48,497 --> 00:33:50,931
I don't care if you like each other or not.

535
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:54,332
But you will respect each other. And maybe...

536
00:33:55,604 --> 00:33:59,005
...I don't know. Maybe you will

537
00:34:00,075 --> 00:34:02,509
...learn to play this game like men.

538
00:34:02,711 --> 00:34:05,373
(players yelling. Grunting)

539
00:34:08,283 --> 00:34:09,580
(whistle blast)

540
00:34:10,953 --> 00:34:12,818
All right.

541
00:34:12,888 --> 00:34:16,984
We'll be out here all night. Till we get this thing right. Let's go.

542
00:34:17,059 --> 00:34:18,321
On the ball. Rev.

543
00:34:18,393 --> 00:34:20,691
Come on. Everybody. Let's get it right!

544
00:34:20,762 --> 00:34:22,889
Ready!

545
00:34:23,966 --> 00:34:25,593
Set!

546
00:34:28,871 --> 00:34:30,702
Let's go! Hut!

547
00:34:38,714 --> 00:34:41,478
What was that. Ray? Whatever it is. It ain't blocking!

548
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,484
Give me a break. Gerry. You want a break? I'll give you a break.

549
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:46,085
Wait a minute. Wait. Wait. Let them handle this.

550
00:34:46,154 --> 00:34:47,553
...to Rev once. Just one time.

551
00:34:47,623 --> 00:34:49,989
I swear to God. I'm gonna hit you so hard. By the time you come to.

552
00:34:50,058 --> 00:34:54,358
Ooh. Boy. You're gonna need a new haircut. You understand me?

553
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:56,920
Ha-ha! Let's play. Fellas.

554
00:34:59,034 --> 00:35:01,025
On the ball. Let's run it again.

555
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:04,828
Ready!

556
00:35:04,907 --> 00:35:06,807
Stay on him. Now!All right.

557
00:35:07,943 --> 00:35:09,934
Set!

558
00:35:10,012 --> 00:35:11,809
Hut!

559
00:35:17,185 --> 00:35:19,153
Get up. Get off me!

560
00:35:19,221 --> 00:35:21,553
Whoo! You all right. Big Petey?

561
00:35:21,623 --> 00:35:23,648
You all right? You really stuck him. Campbell!

562
00:35:23,725 --> 00:35:28,788
Yeah. I love me a little contact. Petey! This is left side!

563
00:35:32,301 --> 00:35:34,235
Strong side! Left side!

564
00:35:34,303 --> 00:35:35,998
Strong side! Left side!

565
00:35:36,071 --> 00:35:38,005
Strong side! Left side!

566
00:35:38,073 --> 00:35:39,631
Strong side! Left side!

567
00:35:39,708 --> 00:35:42,609
Strong side! Aah!

568
00:35:45,781 --> 00:35:48,807
"Eric Burden and War" - "Spill the Wine"

569
00:35:48,884 --> 00:35:50,613
What makes the team? Defense!

570
00:35:50,686 --> 00:35:52,176
What do we play? Defense!

571
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,984
What do we play? Defense!

572
00:35:59,928 --> 00:36:04,900
I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day

573
00:36:06,368 --> 00:36:10,498
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest

574
00:36:10,572 --> 00:36:14,235
Hey. Fellas. Look at that fruitcake.

575
00:36:14,309 --> 00:36:17,244
Gerry. Just keep your mouth shut and get back on that field.

576
00:36:17,312 --> 00:36:19,507
Coach Boone. I'm Colonel Bass.

577
00:36:19,581 --> 00:36:21,776
I transferred here from Huntington Beach. California.

578
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,545
This is my son Ronnie. And he's a quarterback.

579
00:36:23,618 --> 00:36:26,052
How you doing. Ronnie? This is Coach Yoast.

580
00:36:26,121 --> 00:36:27,247
My pleasure. Colonel.

581
00:36:27,322 --> 00:36:29,119
We're pretty set at the quarterback. Colonel.

582
00:36:29,191 --> 00:36:33,423
But if the boy's any good. You may want to check out Wilson or Hamilton.

583
00:36:33,495 --> 00:36:37,522
Well. I. Uh. I met Coach Taylor. He won't let blacks play on his team.

584
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,227
The way I see it. If these boys can fight a war together.

585
00:36:40,302 --> 00:36:43,032
They can play football together. Now. He's a pretty good runner.

586
00:36:43,739 --> 00:36:47,300
Spill the wine and take that pearl

587
00:36:47,376 --> 00:36:50,402
Spill the wine and take that pearl

588
00:36:51,813 --> 00:36:53,576
Yeah. A fruitcake. Huh?

589
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:58,515
I think we can find a place for your boy. Mm-hm.

590
00:36:58,587 --> 00:37:00,555
With one or two conditions.

591
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:08,358
Hey. Sunshine. Sunshine?

592
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,830
Hey. Sun. Sunshine.

593
00:37:10,899 --> 00:37:14,198
All that rubbin' ain't gonna make them golden locks grow back no faster now.

594
00:37:14,269 --> 00:37:16,760
You know that. Right?

595
00:37:16,838 --> 00:37:21,468
Sunshine. Sunshine. Sunshine

596
00:37:21,543 --> 00:37:23,943
Sunshine. Huh? Sunshine. Yeah!

597
00:37:25,847 --> 00:37:28,475
That's cool. I can dig it.

598
00:37:29,484 --> 00:37:32,851
Come on. Now. Don't leave me hanging. Bro. Come on.

599
00:37:32,921 --> 00:37:36,482
Hey. He got a little soul power. Look at this man here.

600
00:37:36,558 --> 00:37:39,083
He called me bro!

601
00:37:39,161 --> 00:37:42,153
Hey. Yo. Man. Hey. I liked him better with the long hair. Bro.

602
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,425
Reminded me of Bertier's mama.

603
00:37:45,934 --> 00:37:47,128
What? What?

604
00:37:47,202 --> 00:37:49,500
How do you know what Bertier's mama looks like?

605
00:37:49,571 --> 00:37:55,532
Brother. Don't you know me and Bertier's mama went out on the town last night!

606
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:57,168
What are you sa? Hold on. Listen now.

607
00:37:57,245 --> 00:37:59,645
Blue. Why you talking about Bertier's mama like that?

608
00:37:59,714 --> 00:38:01,306
See. Now you making me angry. Man.

609
00:38:01,383 --> 00:38:05,285
Look like I ain't gonna be able to take your mama to the prom no more.

610
00:38:05,353 --> 00:38:06,911
What you laughing at. Jerry Buck?

611
00:38:06,988 --> 00:38:09,582
You need to tell your mama to shave them old legs of hers. Bro.

612
00:38:09,658 --> 00:38:12,456
And. Julius. When she's done. Maybe your mama can borrow the razor

613
00:38:12,527 --> 00:38:15,496
and shave that old nasty back of hers. Bro.

614
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:17,929
Wait. Wait. Wait.

615
00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:20,524
You mad 'cause she lookin' like the Wolf Man.

616
00:38:20,602 --> 00:38:24,094
Hey. Hey. Lastik. Man. What happened to you?

617
00:38:24,172 --> 00:38:29,474
Man. I just gave your mama a piggyback ride and she weighs twice as much as I do.

618
00:38:31,012 --> 00:38:34,971
That ain't funny. That's a mama joke!

619
00:38:35,383 --> 00:38:40,821
"Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell" - "Ain't No Mountain High Enough"

620
00:38:40,889 --> 00:38:43,380
Listen. Baby

621
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:47,326
Ain't no mountain high. Ain't no valley low

622
00:38:47,395 --> 00:38:50,956
Ain't no river wide enough. Baby

623
00:38:51,032 --> 00:38:53,296
If you need me. Call me

624
00:38:53,368 --> 00:38:56,895
No matter where you are. No matter how far

625
00:38:56,972 --> 00:38:58,667
No. No. Darlin'

626
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:02,301
Just call my name. I'll be there in a hurry

627
00:39:02,377 --> 00:39:04,402
You don't have to worry

628
00:39:04,479 --> 00:39:07,039
'Cause. Baby. There ain't no mountain high enough

629
00:39:07,115 --> 00:39:09,777
So. Julius. I was thinking that we... He's in the shower.

630
00:39:13,054 --> 00:39:17,855
What do you want. Man? You know what I want.

631
00:39:17,926 --> 00:39:19,484
Whoa!

632
00:39:31,306 --> 00:39:33,672
Hey. Bertier!

633
00:39:33,742 --> 00:39:34,834
Get off! Get off!

634
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:37,003
You have no idea who you messed with. Man!

635
00:39:37,078 --> 00:39:39,273
There's too much male bonding going on in here for me.

636
00:39:39,347 --> 00:39:41,838
- I'm out. - You dig? All right!

637
00:39:41,883 --> 00:39:44,443
What is going on here?

638
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,011
He kissed me. Man!

639
00:39:48,089 --> 00:39:50,649
(laughter)

640
00:39:52,227 --> 00:39:55,719
Ain't no mountain high enough

641
00:39:55,797 --> 00:39:59,597
Ain't no valley low enough

642
00:39:59,668 --> 00:40:03,104
Ain't no river wide enough

643
00:40:03,171 --> 00:40:06,163
To keep me from getting to you. Baby

644
00:40:06,241 --> 00:40:07,640
Ronnie Bass. Yes. Sir.

645
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:10,303
I like that haircut. Get in there and show me what you got. Option left.

646
00:40:10,378 --> 00:40:12,346
Let's go. Baby. Rookie quarterback.

647
00:40:12,747 --> 00:40:14,977
Left. Left! Left!

648
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:19,413
Set! Hut!

649
00:40:20,655 --> 00:40:22,179
Ball! Ball! Ball!

650
00:40:22,557 --> 00:40:26,550
Hard step. Read the tackle.

651
00:40:26,628 --> 00:40:27,959
Got to see the pitch. All right? Yes. Sir.

652
00:40:28,029 --> 00:40:30,725
Now. You can throw it a mile. But you can't pitch it three yards.

653
00:40:30,799 --> 00:40:33,290
Got to see it. If you don't read it. You weep. Rev!

654
00:40:33,335 --> 00:40:35,496
Yes. Sir.

655
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:36,730
Show him how. Yes. Sir.

656
00:40:43,211 --> 00:40:45,543
Yeah. I'll take it. Man.

657
00:40:45,614 --> 00:40:51,109
Hey. Can you slide a bit. Gerry? Hey. Ray. This is defensive table.

658
00:40:54,055 --> 00:40:56,421
Hi. Petey. Yo. Man.

659
00:40:56,491 --> 00:40:59,119
Hey. Sunshine.

660
00:40:59,194 --> 00:41:03,392
It's not like I care or nothing. But you know. Just being your roommate and all.

661
00:41:03,465 --> 00:41:07,094
You was just messing with Bertier. Right? You was just messing with his mind. Right?

662
00:41:07,168 --> 00:41:11,195
You're not really? What are you talking about. Petey?

663
00:41:11,573 --> 00:41:14,406
Look. Man. It don't matter to me. You know. If. You know. If...

664
00:41:14,476 --> 00:41:16,273
I just got to know. You know?

665
00:41:16,344 --> 00:41:19,438
If it don't matter. What's the big deal?

666
00:41:20,048 --> 00:41:22,608
I got to know. Know what?

667
00:41:22,684 --> 00:41:25,414
You know what I gotta know. Don't mess with my mind!

668
00:41:25,487 --> 00:41:28,251
Look like Coach been keeping Petey out in the sun for too long. Bro.

669
00:41:28,323 --> 00:41:32,850
Coach. Hey. Sweetie. Sit down.

670
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:34,100
Have my dessert.

671
00:41:34,303 --> 00:41:36,999
Coach Boone?

672
00:41:37,072 --> 00:41:41,941
You did a good job up here. You ran a tough camp from what I can see.

673
00:41:42,011 --> 00:41:45,447
Well. I'm very happy to have the approval of a five-year-old.

674
00:41:45,514 --> 00:41:49,280
I'm nine and a half. Thank you very much.

675
00:41:49,351 --> 00:41:52,445
Why don't you give this little girl some pretty dolls or something. Coach?

676
00:41:52,521 --> 00:41:54,200
I tried. She loves football.

677
00:41:54,517 --> 00:41:58,647
What are you?!Mobile! Agile! Hostile!

678
00:41:58,721 --> 00:42:02,088
What is pain? French bread!

679
00:42:02,158 --> 00:42:04,991
What is fatigue? Army clothes!

680
00:42:05,061 --> 00:42:08,656
Will you ever quit? No!

681
00:42:08,731 --> 00:42:11,165
We want some mo'! We want some mo'!

682
00:42:11,234 --> 00:42:14,362
We want some mo'! Turn in!

683
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:24,740
Let me ask you something. Mr. Campbell.

684
00:42:24,814 --> 00:42:27,442
Uh-huh. What kind of power you got?

685
00:42:27,517 --> 00:42:30,281
Oh. Man. You know I got some soul power.

686
00:42:30,353 --> 00:42:31,877
What kind of power you got?

687
00:42:31,954 --> 00:42:34,115
What kind of question is that? I got soul power!

688
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,521
Yes. You do! Right on!

689
00:42:35,591 --> 00:42:37,286
Let me ask you something now. Mr. Bertier.

690
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,793
Yes. How strong are you?

691
00:42:38,861 --> 00:42:40,419
I'm too strong! What?

692
00:42:40,496 --> 00:42:42,794
I'm too strong! Oh. How strong?

693
00:42:42,865 --> 00:42:44,423
Too strong! Oh. Right on. Baby!

694
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,525
I want a victory! No. I want victory!

695
00:42:46,602 --> 00:42:48,900
I want a victory! No. I want a victory!

696
00:42:48,971 --> 00:42:50,871
You all want victory?

697
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,306
You all want victory?

698
00:42:59,515 --> 00:43:01,312
Goodbye

699
00:43:01,384 --> 00:43:05,582
Na na na na. Hey. Hey. Hey

700
00:43:05,655 --> 00:43:08,021
Goodbye Let me hear you!

701
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:12,083
Let me hear you! Up in the front! Up in the front! Whole school!

702
00:43:13,396 --> 00:43:15,990
What'd they do up there? Brainwash 'em?

703
00:43:16,065 --> 00:43:18,727
They must be high on something.

704
00:43:22,772 --> 00:43:25,036
Hi. Mom. Oh. Welcome home.

705
00:43:25,107 --> 00:43:26,301
Dad.

706
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:29,935
How you doing. Sweetheart? We missed you so much.

707
00:43:30,012 --> 00:43:32,913
Hey. Man. Like. Are we cool?

708
00:43:32,982 --> 00:43:34,279
Yeah. We're cool.

709
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:36,284
Mrs. Boone. Nice to meet you. You. Too.

710
00:43:36,352 --> 00:43:39,947
Yeah. This is little Karen. This is Nicky. Nicky. That's Sheryl.

711
00:43:40,656 --> 00:43:43,784
Why do you dress so weird?

712
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:46,760
Ow! Look who's talking.

713
00:43:46,829 --> 00:43:48,763
Ow.

714
00:43:48,831 --> 00:43:51,061
Well. We're just all getting along. Aren't we?

715
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:53,730


716
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:57,230


717
00:43:57,974 --> 00:44:02,434
"Joseph and Willie Chambers" - "Time Has Come"

718
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:08,730


719
00:44:10,286 --> 00:44:13,119
What you doing in my school. Boy?

720
00:44:13,189 --> 00:44:15,020
Man. This stuff is messed up.

721
00:44:15,091 --> 00:44:17,685
Anything serious happen. And they shut the school down.

722
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,628
And our season goes down the drain. This here's real messed up.

723
00:44:21,697 --> 00:44:24,530
But there are a lot of pretty women here.

724
00:44:25,468 --> 00:44:30,269
Hey. Look at 'em. Gerry.

725
00:44:30,339 --> 00:44:33,137
They hate us. Nah.

726
00:44:33,209 --> 00:44:36,007
Just a bad day. Things'll cool down.

727
00:44:36,078 --> 00:44:38,137
No. Gerry. They're always gonna hate us.

728
00:44:40,116 --> 00:44:42,607
We don't need you here either. Hippie boy.

729
00:44:42,652 --> 00:44:44,677
You hear what he said?

730
00:44:46,188 --> 00:44:48,383
Hey. Man. Hey. Julius.

731
00:44:48,457 --> 00:44:52,450
Man. It's crazy out here. Man. Yeah. Well. What did you expect?

732
00:44:52,528 --> 00:44:55,895
I don't know. I ain't quite expect it to be like this.

733
00:44:55,965 --> 00:44:59,332
Ah. Sorry. Julius. This is Emma.

734
00:45:08,744 --> 00:45:14,341
Camp over now. Huh? Back to the real world. Bertier.

735
00:45:14,417 --> 00:45:16,612
This is what they integrating us for?

736
00:45:16,686 --> 00:45:20,486
We'd have been better off staying where we were.

737
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,197
Mmm.

738
00:45:33,269 --> 00:45:36,500
Yeah. This is my sanctuary. Right here.

739
00:45:38,708 --> 00:45:43,907
All this hatred and turmoil swirling around us. But this..this is always right.

740
00:45:43,979 --> 00:45:46,106
Struggle.

741
00:45:46,182 --> 00:45:48,241
Survival.

742
00:45:48,317 --> 00:45:50,285
Victory and defeat.

743
00:45:54,256 --> 00:45:56,554
It's just a game. Doc. But...

744
00:45:58,627 --> 00:46:00,322
...I love it.

745
00:46:01,997 --> 00:46:06,559
Coach. I'm afraid I've put you into a no-win situation.

746
00:46:06,635 --> 00:46:09,661
I just found out the board didn't even think you'd make it out of camp.

747
00:46:09,739 --> 00:46:13,140
And now that you have. I've learned that at the first sign of trouble...

748
00:46:13,209 --> 00:46:14,699
Trouble? What kind of trouble?

749
00:46:14,744 --> 00:46:19,010
Lose a game... they'll fire you.

750
00:46:19,081 --> 00:46:21,709
And turn it back over to Yoast.

751
00:46:21,784 --> 00:46:22,944
One game. Just like that?

752
00:46:23,018 --> 00:46:25,782
Mm-hm. What about my family?

753
00:46:26,388 --> 00:46:28,447
We just got here. They just expect me to pick up and move?

754
00:46:28,524 --> 00:46:32,961
What about my girls? I don't know what to say.

755
00:46:34,096 --> 00:46:35,688
I'm sorry. Coach.

756
00:46:35,765 --> 00:46:38,063
Pump. Pump. Pump it up!

757
00:46:39,535 --> 00:46:41,059
Pump that Titan spirit up!

758
00:46:41,137 --> 00:46:42,968
Look at 'em.

759
00:46:43,038 --> 00:46:48,601
They come here to watch the game and they still don't want no part of us.

760
00:46:59,488 --> 00:47:02,821
Give us more!

761
00:47:11,967 --> 00:47:16,666
Everybody on their feet. On your feet. On your feet. Let's go. Let's go.

762
00:47:16,739 --> 00:47:22,644
Listen up. I'm not gonna talk to you tonight about winning and losing.

763
00:47:22,711 --> 00:47:27,333
You're already winners. 'cause you didn't kill each other up at camp.

764
00:47:28,984 --> 00:47:32,181
Tonight we got Hayfield.

765
00:47:32,254 --> 00:47:36,247
Like all the other schools in this conference. They're all white.

766
00:47:36,325 --> 00:47:40,421
They don't have to worry about race. We do.

767
00:47:41,831 --> 00:47:44,322
But we're better for it. Men.

768
00:47:44,366 --> 00:47:47,631
Let me tell you something. You don't let anything.

769
00:47:47,703 --> 00:47:51,104
Nothing. Come between us.

770
00:47:51,173 --> 00:47:53,368
Nothing tears us apart.

771
00:47:53,442 --> 00:47:57,776
Greek mythology. The Titans were greater even than the gods.

772
00:47:57,847 --> 00:48:00,179
They ruled their universe with absolute power.

773
00:48:00,249 --> 00:48:03,946
Well. That football field out there tonight. That's our universe.

774
00:48:04,019 --> 00:48:05,919
Let's rule it like Titans.

775
00:48:06,555 --> 00:48:08,785
(crowd cheers)

776
00:48:14,597 --> 00:48:17,293
So the Titans defense takes the field for the first time

777
00:48:17,366 --> 00:48:20,802
against the Hayfield Hawks. Led by quarterback Daniel O'Connell

778
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:23,236
on the Hawks' 32-yard line.

779
00:48:23,305 --> 00:48:24,602
Aww!

780
00:48:26,475 --> 00:48:31,482
We're moving like molasses out there. For crying out loud! I mean. Come on!

781
00:48:34,683 --> 00:48:36,548
Mama? Hm?

782
00:48:36,619 --> 00:48:39,884
Are all white girls that crazy? What?

783
00:48:39,955 --> 00:48:42,389
You guys can do better than that.

784
00:48:43,926 --> 00:48:46,224
Huddle up. Fellas. Huddle up.

785
00:48:46,295 --> 00:48:49,662
Bosley? Where's Alan? Alan. You've got to stick your man!

786
00:48:49,732 --> 00:48:52,599
They're gonna score on us all night... He's too fast. Gerry. I can't stick with him.

787
00:48:52,668 --> 00:48:54,329
Let's go. Let's go. Let's move.

788
00:48:54,403 --> 00:48:57,133
22! Hut! Hut!

789
00:49:01,977 --> 00:49:04,878
Touchdown Hawks!

790
00:49:09,285 --> 00:49:12,220
Shape up that defense. Yoast. You just worry about your offense.

791
00:49:12,288 --> 00:49:14,279
They score again. I'm taking over.

792
00:49:25,968 --> 00:49:27,230
Hut! Hut!

793
00:49:33,342 --> 00:49:35,037
Petey. Get over here! What are you doing. Son?

794
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:39,240
You missed the block by a mile. You didn't even have the football to fumble this time.

795
00:49:39,315 --> 00:49:41,249
There's no excuse. No excuse!

796
00:49:41,317 --> 00:49:43,478
You want to play football or not?

797
00:49:43,552 --> 00:49:48,717
Do you want to play football? Boy. Get over there on the bench.

798
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:52,225
Herb. Take over for me. You got it.

799
00:49:53,429 --> 00:49:55,522
Petey! You all right?

800
00:49:56,699 --> 00:49:59,327
I was a two-year starter at G.W. Mm.

801
00:49:59,401 --> 00:50:02,336
All this yelling he's doing. It don't do nothing but make me play worse.

802
00:50:02,404 --> 00:50:05,703
I can't play for this man. You come play linebacker for me.

803
00:50:05,774 --> 00:50:09,870
23's killing us. I want you to get out there. I want you to cover him for me.

804
00:50:09,945 --> 00:50:11,776
You want me to go in now? Yeah.

805
00:50:11,847 --> 00:50:16,341
I can't! I haven't practiced with the defense. I can't.

806
00:50:16,418 --> 00:50:18,579
That doesn't matter. I just want you to get out there. I want you to cover 23.

807
00:50:18,654 --> 00:50:22,351
That's all you have to do. We'll talk about the rest after we put this one away.

808
00:50:22,424 --> 00:50:24,949
You think Yoast is trying to let them score on purpose?

809
00:50:25,027 --> 00:50:26,858
What? Do you?

810
00:50:26,929 --> 00:50:28,760
Oh. Come on. Herman.

811
00:50:28,831 --> 00:50:31,391
OK. Let's go.

812
00:50:32,935 --> 00:50:35,699
What is Petey doing in there?

813
00:50:38,007 --> 00:50:41,773
Looks like Yoast is trying him out on defense.

814
00:50:41,844 --> 00:50:43,937
He's taking Alan out. Yoast!

815
00:50:44,947 --> 00:50:47,643
Herman. Herman. Herman. Come on. Let's see.

816
00:50:47,716 --> 00:50:49,308
See what happens. It might be all right.

817
00:50:49,385 --> 00:50:50,943
Yoast! It's OK. You're OK.

818
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:52,044
Yoast!

819
00:50:52,121 --> 00:50:53,918
Don't you take out my son!

820
00:50:53,989 --> 00:50:56,321
He's getting beat like he stole something. Mr. Bosley.

821
00:50:56,392 --> 00:50:58,087
You just stay out of it. Girl!

822
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,559
He's just getting beat! That's all I'm saying.

823
00:50:59,628 --> 00:51:00,617
Yoast!

824
00:51:03,999 --> 00:51:05,990
Hut! Hut!

825
00:51:11,373 --> 00:51:14,240
"The Temptations" - "Superstar Remember Where You Got Where You Are"

826
00:51:14,309 --> 00:51:18,302
Down! Set! Hut!

827
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:21,042
Hut! Hut! Hut!

828
00:51:35,097 --> 00:51:37,258
Go. Defense!

829
00:51:38,067 --> 00:51:40,968
Set! Hut!

830
00:51:54,349 --> 00:51:56,214
Yeah!

831
00:51:59,521 --> 00:52:01,887
Touchdown! Game. Titans!

832
00:52:01,957 --> 00:52:03,925
Yeah!

833
00:52:03,992 --> 00:52:06,654
The Titans are here. Y'all. And we ain't going nowhere!

834
00:52:06,728 --> 00:52:09,754
Yo. You got to be loud all the time. Man? Virginia can hear you. Baby.

835
00:52:09,832 --> 00:52:11,993
Don't forget about your fumble. First of all. The hand.

836
00:52:12,067 --> 00:52:13,796
Second of all. Who won the game?

837
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:15,803
My dad is... Don't worry about it.

838
00:52:15,871 --> 00:52:18,738
It's not your fault. They like to show off and that's what they do.

839
00:52:18,807 --> 00:52:21,435
Wait. Wait. Wait. "They"?

840
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:23,171
Yeah. What? I heard you say "they."

841
00:52:23,245 --> 00:52:25,110
Yeah. They. Them. Them over there.

842
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:26,772
But what you mean by "they"? You talking about Pete.

843
00:52:26,849 --> 00:52:28,214
You're you and I'm me.

844
00:52:28,283 --> 00:52:29,944
(car honks)

845
00:52:30,018 --> 00:52:32,111
Gerry.

846
00:52:32,187 --> 00:52:34,781
Hey. Gerry. Hop in. Buddy.

847
00:52:36,391 --> 00:52:39,758
We're heading over to the hill. Gerry. Everyone's gonna be there.

848
00:52:39,828 --> 00:52:42,262
Why don't you hang out down here with us? We're. You know...

849
00:52:43,966 --> 00:52:45,399
What are you trying to do. Gerry?

850
00:52:45,467 --> 00:52:47,958
Listen. When something unexpected comes.

851
00:52:48,003 --> 00:52:49,834
You just got to pick it up and run with it.

852
00:52:49,905 --> 00:52:54,171
I'm not running in the same direction as you are. Gerry.

853
00:52:54,243 --> 00:52:56,905
Come with us.

854
00:52:56,979 --> 00:53:00,972
Look. Standing up for what you believe in. It's all well and good.

855
00:53:01,049 --> 00:53:05,577
But you got your priorities real mixed up this time.

856
00:53:07,489 --> 00:53:10,322
Are you coming or not. Man?

857
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:25,866
Here he goes.

858
00:53:25,941 --> 00:53:27,533
Come on. Man. No. Man.

859
00:53:27,609 --> 00:53:31,306
What? It's on me. Man. We party on. Let's go.

860
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:34,679
Look here. Man. All right? This here's Virginia. All right?

861
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:38,242
They got problems with. You know... They don't want us in there. Man.

862
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,550
Man. That's history. Bro. It's on me. Come on.

863
00:53:53,235 --> 00:53:55,635
We're full tonight. Boys.

864
00:53:55,704 --> 00:53:59,401
What? There's tables all over the place. What are you talking about?

865
00:53:59,474 --> 00:54:01,635
Well. This is my establishment.

866
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:04,804
I reserve the right to refuse service to anybody.

867
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,246
Yeah. That means you too. Hippie boy.

868
00:54:07,316 --> 00:54:10,217
Now. Y'all want something to eat. You can take these boys out back

869
00:54:10,285 --> 00:54:12,116
and pick it up from the kitchen.

870
00:54:13,322 --> 00:54:14,949
What'd I tell you. Man? Yo. Come on. Petey. Man.

871
00:54:15,023 --> 00:54:16,320
Petey. I didn't know. Man.

872
00:54:16,391 --> 00:54:18,757
I told you! What you mean. You didn't know?

873
00:54:18,827 --> 00:54:20,920
What. You think I was playing with you? Man. He didn't know. Petey.

874
00:54:20,996 --> 00:54:24,090
Blue. He don't want to know!

875
00:54:24,166 --> 00:54:26,532
You pull some crap like that. You'd better be able to back it up.

876
00:54:26,602 --> 00:54:29,400
Man. Let's go. Man. Why don't you cool out? Cool out!

877
00:54:29,471 --> 00:54:32,463
Let's go. Rev. Man. Let's go.

878
00:54:32,541 --> 00:54:33,940
What happened? What happened?

879
00:54:34,009 --> 00:54:37,410
This man acting the fool tonight.Man.Petey.

880
00:54:37,479 --> 00:54:40,710
Man. Don't even talk to that man. Man. He acting all crazy and stuff. Man.

881
00:54:40,782 --> 00:54:42,716
It don't even make no sense. Petey.

882
00:54:42,784 --> 00:54:45,685
He know the man's from out of town.

883
00:54:47,022 --> 00:54:49,422
Five times. Five times. Player of the week.

884
00:54:49,491 --> 00:54:53,860
He's not some walk-on scrub. Yoast. The boy's a player. He's a star!

885
00:54:53,929 --> 00:54:57,797
And he busted his butt for you! This is all your doing. You blacks.

886
00:54:57,866 --> 00:55:01,461
That is enough. It's my call.

887
00:55:01,536 --> 00:55:05,131
Now. Listen. You just go on home now. Fred.

888
00:55:05,207 --> 00:55:09,143
Before you do something that you're gonna regret.

889
00:55:15,384 --> 00:55:19,081
Yeah. Well. Guess we won't be seeing much of him. Huh?

890
00:55:19,154 --> 00:55:22,851
I will. He's on the deacon board with me.

891
00:55:24,459 --> 00:55:28,225
All right. Listen. About Petey. No thanks required. Coach.

892
00:55:30,065 --> 00:55:32,363
Thanks?

893
00:55:32,434 --> 00:55:36,165
You challenged my authority in front of the entire football team. Coach.

894
00:55:36,238 --> 00:55:39,207
Now. You think you're doing these boys a favor. Taking 'em aside

895
00:55:39,274 --> 00:55:44,769
every time I come down on 'em. Protecting 'em from Big Bad Boone.

896
00:55:44,846 --> 00:55:48,009
You're cutting my legs from under me.

897
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:50,677
Some of the boys just don't respond well to public criticism.

898
00:55:50,752 --> 00:55:55,555
I tell them what they need to know. But I don't humiliate them in front of the team.

899
00:55:56,925 --> 00:56:01,487
Which boys are you talking about? Which ones you talking about?

900
00:56:01,563 --> 00:56:05,590
I come down on Bertier. I don't see you coddle him.

901
00:56:05,667 --> 00:56:09,763
Come down on Sunshine. Don't see you grab his hand. Take him off to the side.

902
00:56:09,838 --> 00:56:14,002
Which boys are you talking about?

903
00:56:14,076 --> 00:56:16,442
Now. I may be a mean cuss. But I'm the same mean cuss

904
00:56:16,511 --> 00:56:20,140
with everybody out there on that football field.

905
00:56:20,215 --> 00:56:22,513
The world don't give a damn about how sensitive these kids are.

906
00:56:22,584 --> 00:56:26,315
Especially the young black kids.

907
00:56:26,388 --> 00:56:31,587
You ain't doing these kids a favor by patronizing 'em.

908
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:36,188
You're crippling 'em. You're crippling them for life.

909
00:56:45,407 --> 00:56:49,173
Gerry. What are you doing? I'm going down to the Berg.

910
00:56:49,244 --> 00:56:50,836
The Berg? Yup.

911
00:56:50,912 --> 00:56:55,349
What are you doing at the Berg? I'm gonna play basketball with Julius.

912
00:56:55,417 --> 00:56:56,543
Then we're gonna come back here for dinner.

913
00:56:56,618 --> 00:57:01,920
Gerry. If your father was still alive... Ma. Would... Just give him a chance.

914
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:04,185
Just get to know him. Listen to him for two seconds.

915
00:57:04,259 --> 00:57:08,593
I don't want to get to know him.

916
00:57:08,663 --> 00:57:11,097
You are coming to church with your mother.

917
00:57:13,168 --> 00:57:15,398
Right!Right!Right!

918
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:17,062
He's mine! Hut!

919
00:57:22,912 --> 00:57:23,978


920
00:57:23,979 --> 00:57:25,913
You blew your assignment! I'm covering for you.

921
00:57:25,981 --> 00:57:28,916
Don't get in my face. Yo. Cool out. Cool out.

922
00:57:28,984 --> 00:57:32,920
Where you at? What planet you on tonight?

923
00:57:34,890 --> 00:57:37,017
It's fine. Man. I knew you was gonna stand me up.

924
00:57:37,092 --> 00:57:38,992
I figured you weren't gonna make it out to the Berg. No way.

925
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:42,188
I knew you was all talk. But now you making us look bad out there on the field.

926
00:57:42,264 --> 00:57:45,256
Don't talk to me. Man. You ain't got nothing to say to me.

927
00:57:45,333 --> 00:57:49,360
Why the clouds. Sunshine? I can't make that pitch. Petey.

928
00:57:50,238 --> 00:57:54,004
You ain't gonna never play. Anyway. Unless we're up by 50 points.

929
00:57:54,075 --> 00:57:56,134
And seeing how we ain't never gonna be up by no 50 points.

930
00:57:56,211 --> 00:57:59,647
You might just as well sit back. Relax and enjoy the bench.

931
00:57:59,714 --> 00:58:03,912
How's it going. Yo? Man. I didn't sign up to play like this.

932
00:58:03,985 --> 00:58:05,748
These guys we're playing got no heart.

933
00:58:05,821 --> 00:58:08,688
We play like this against Groveton. We're going down.

934
00:58:08,757 --> 00:58:12,022
OK. Offense. Offense. Let's go.

935
00:58:13,728 --> 00:58:15,525
Hut!

936
00:58:19,167 --> 00:58:23,103
Touchdown. Titans! Game. Titans!

937
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:35,013
How you doing. Coach? Morning.

938
00:58:35,083 --> 00:58:37,210
Where's your dad? He's in his office.

939
00:58:37,285 --> 00:58:40,152
Nicky. You all right? Yes. Daddy.

940
00:58:41,189 --> 00:58:45,717
What you doing? Shooting some hoops.

941
00:58:45,794 --> 00:58:47,227
Wanna play?

942
00:58:53,502 --> 00:58:56,699
I just did my nails.

943
00:58:56,771 --> 00:58:59,331
How you doing? Tyrell.

944
00:58:59,407 --> 00:59:02,308
Coach. If you don't need me. I'm gonna...

945
00:59:02,377 --> 00:59:06,370
I'm gonna wait out back. All right. Herb.

946
00:59:06,448 --> 00:59:10,782
Coach Boone. To what do I owe the surprise? Have a seat.

947
00:59:11,786 --> 00:59:13,151
I'll get straight to it.

948
00:59:13,221 --> 00:59:16,054
We won't survive another game like the one we played last Friday.

949
00:59:16,124 --> 00:59:19,218
So I spoke to Mr. Vernon. The math teacher.

950
00:59:19,294 --> 00:59:23,958
Asked him to look at the game film from Groveton. Who we got next week.

951
00:59:24,032 --> 00:59:29,129
I asked him to analyze it for me. Every coach has certain tendencies.

952
00:59:30,472 --> 00:59:32,337
All of 'em except Ed Henry.

953
00:59:33,041 --> 00:59:36,067
The only time we'd be seeing Ed Henry is at the state championship.

954
00:59:36,144 --> 00:59:37,736
Mm-hm.

955
00:59:43,084 --> 00:59:47,350
Well. Gosh. This is...This is great stuff.

956
00:59:47,422 --> 00:59:51,256
Every quarter broken down. How many times they run each play.

957
00:59:51,326 --> 00:59:54,227
I mean... You like that. Huh?

958
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:59,326
We'll be very tough defensively with this. I think so.

959
01:00:00,101 --> 01:00:03,264
I brought Nicky by. She was asking me about Sheryl.

960
01:00:03,338 --> 01:00:06,774
I'm getting ready to take her over to some of her friends' house.

961
01:00:06,841 --> 01:00:08,604
Anytime you wanna bring her by the house.

962
01:00:08,677 --> 01:00:11,942
We'd be more than happy to have her.

963
01:00:14,316 --> 01:00:17,683
"I'm Your Venus"

964
01:00:26,261 --> 01:00:29,355
Oh. He's so cute.

965
01:00:29,431 --> 01:00:31,763
He's in my third-period class.

966
01:00:31,833 --> 01:00:33,926
(bell ringing)

967
01:00:34,069 --> 01:00:37,061
What y'all staring at old Sunshine for?

968
01:00:37,138 --> 01:00:40,005
I'm the one dominating on the field. He ain't played a minute all year.

969
01:00:40,075 --> 01:00:41,838
Who cares about the field?

970
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:43,844
I don't want to be the one to break your heart.

971
01:00:43,912 --> 01:00:45,675
But Sunshine's from California.

972
01:00:45,747 --> 01:00:47,681
Yeah. A California dreamboat.

973
01:00:47,749 --> 01:00:53,278
No. Sunshine is from California. He's a California man.

974
01:00:53,355 --> 01:00:55,653
You talking to my girl?

975
01:00:55,724 --> 01:01:00,627
I don't see any livestock around here. So I don't know what you talking about.

976
01:01:00,695 --> 01:01:02,424
Oh!

977
01:01:03,431 --> 01:01:05,160
Rodney. Stop it. Leave him alone.

978
01:01:05,233 --> 01:01:07,258
Get off me. Get off me.

979
01:01:09,537 --> 01:01:11,300
You want some?

980
01:01:11,373 --> 01:01:13,705
Break it up. Break it...

981
01:01:13,775 --> 01:01:15,868
Get your hands off me. Man!

982
01:01:15,944 --> 01:01:19,038
Hey. Get off me! Julius. Man.

983
01:01:19,114 --> 01:01:20,376
Chill!

984
01:01:20,448 --> 01:01:22,439
Petey. Get these girls out of here!

985
01:01:22,951 --> 01:01:24,919
Get out of here. Let's go. Come on!

986
01:01:24,986 --> 01:01:26,817
Uncle Tom traitor! Uncle Tom!

987
01:01:26,888 --> 01:01:30,551
I know you didn't call me no Uncle Tom. Y'all better back off me now. Man.

988
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:32,058
Go! Move!

989
01:01:32,127 --> 01:01:35,028
Looks like you went to the zoo and made some new friends. Bertier.

990
01:01:35,096 --> 01:01:38,862
Oh. Big smart guy. Huh?

991
01:01:49,444 --> 01:01:52,038
Marie's asked about Sheryl. Wanted to know if she'd come spend the night.

992
01:01:52,113 --> 01:01:54,013
I told her I'd run it by you. See what you thought.

993
01:01:54,082 --> 01:01:55,606
Yeah.

994
01:01:55,684 --> 01:01:58,847
She's over at the Boones' tonight. I was gonna swing by on my way home

995
01:01:58,920 --> 01:01:59,909
and pick her up.

996
01:01:59,988 --> 01:02:02,422
Over at the Boones'. Huh?

997
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:04,515
Yeah.

998
01:02:06,895 --> 01:02:10,661
So that's the way it is. Huh? Hey. You haven't changed a bit.

999
01:02:10,732 --> 01:02:14,224
You always wanna try and please everybody. Be the nice guy.

1000
01:02:15,103 --> 01:02:18,504
Sooner or later. A man's got to pick sides.

1001
01:02:18,573 --> 01:02:22,407
As for me. Well. I'm not gonna put myself through the rest of the season with that...

1002
01:02:22,477 --> 01:02:28,313
Hey. I brought you here. I want you with me.

1003
01:02:28,383 --> 01:02:31,978
But you got to do what you got to do.

1004
01:02:35,457 --> 01:02:38,153
That's all you can say to me after all we've been through?

1005
01:02:38,226 --> 01:02:40,194
"Do what you got to do"? Hey. Herb...

1006
01:02:40,261 --> 01:02:42,923
You go to hell.

1007
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:55,166
That veer's getting better. I'll admit that.

1008
01:02:55,243 --> 01:02:58,269
But you're still weak on the left side. We're not weak on the left side.

1009
01:02:58,346 --> 01:03:00,780
We just got to work harder on the left side. That's all.

1010
01:03:00,849 --> 01:03:02,544
That's not the problem. What is the problem?

1011
01:03:02,617 --> 01:03:04,585
You think it is. But it ain't. It's your pass reads.

1012
01:03:04,652 --> 01:03:06,847
It's not... It's a run anyway. It's not a pass.

1013
01:03:06,921 --> 01:03:09,788
The veer is a run. Not a pass. All right. You two. That's enough of that.

1014
01:03:09,858 --> 01:03:13,259
Sheryl. Don't you want to play with Nicky?

1015
01:03:14,028 --> 01:03:18,692
I hate playing with dolls. I'm not playing. I'm accessorizing.

1016
01:03:18,767 --> 01:03:24,501
Yeah. Why don't you go accessorize? Don't you want to go accessorize with?

1017
01:03:24,572 --> 01:03:27,268
Hey. Coach Coon!

1018
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:31,972
In the back. In the back.

1019
01:03:39,721 --> 01:03:42,212
(tires screech)

1020
01:03:55,904 --> 01:03:58,464
Where's Coach. Man? What he want with us now?

1021
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:01,134
Coaches ain't called this meeting tonight. We did.

1022
01:04:01,476 --> 01:04:02,465
We outta here.

1023
01:04:02,544 --> 01:04:04,341
Hey. How y'all gonna walk out on your teammate like that?

1024
01:04:04,412 --> 01:04:05,936
He say he got something to say. Y'all got to listen to him.

1025
01:04:06,014 --> 01:04:09,245
Turn around! Turn around! Where you going? Turn around!

1026
01:04:09,317 --> 01:04:11,251
Coach Boone brought us this far. Y'all.

1027
01:04:11,319 --> 01:04:14,220
But he ain't gonna be there for us forever. Man.

1028
01:04:14,289 --> 01:04:16,780
So what? We won a few games.

1029
01:04:16,825 --> 01:04:19,885
And y'all fools think that's something?

1030
01:04:19,961 --> 01:04:23,294
Man. That ain't nothing. Y'all! And you know what else?

1031
01:04:23,364 --> 01:04:28,563
We ain't nothing. Either. Yeah. We came together in camp. Cool.

1032
01:04:28,636 --> 01:04:31,264
But then we're right back here and the world tells us

1033
01:04:31,339 --> 01:04:33,000
that they don't want us to be together.

1034
01:04:33,074 --> 01:04:37,170
We fall apart like we ain't a damn bit of nothing. Man!

1035
01:04:37,245 --> 01:04:41,944
And y'all think we done won something? Man. We ain't won nothing. Y'all.

1036
01:04:42,016 --> 01:04:45,452
Nothing! Rev. What's that you're always telling me

1037
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:49,183
when I get sick of trying to keep up with my grades and stuff?

1038
01:04:49,257 --> 01:04:54,661
Even youths grow tired and weary

1039
01:04:54,729 --> 01:04:57,289
Even young men stumble and fall

1040
01:04:57,365 --> 01:05:02,894
But those who trust in the Lord will renew their strength

1041
01:05:02,971 --> 01:05:06,168
See. Amen! Amen! That's what I'm talking about.

1042
01:05:06,241 --> 01:05:09,005
Amen. Amen. Right? That's right. Rev.

1043
01:05:09,077 --> 01:05:12,740
Yeah! Yeah! They will soar on wings like eagles

1044
01:05:12,814 --> 01:05:16,807
Oh. Like eagles. Y'all like eagles. Y'all

1045
01:05:16,885 --> 01:05:21,727
They will walk and not grow faint Yeah! Can I get an amen!

1046
01:05:26,628 --> 01:05:29,620
Yeah! Yeah!

1047
01:05:30,865 --> 01:05:34,631
We're playing Groveton Friday night. Y'all!

1048
01:05:34,702 --> 01:05:36,897
You all gonna play like you ain't got no heart?

1049
01:05:36,971 --> 01:05:39,531
No! Do y'all want a victory?

1050
01:05:39,607 --> 01:05:42,098
Yeah! Do y'all want a victory?

1051
01:05:42,176 --> 01:05:44,303
Yeah! Turn in!

1052
01:05:44,379 --> 01:05:46,540
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh...

1053
01:05:48,883 --> 01:05:50,748
Yeah!

1054
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:56,414
Like I said. We will not be intimidated. We're gonna play football games.

1055
01:05:56,491 --> 01:05:59,358
Hatred. Violence will not intimidate us! Coach! Coach!

1056
01:05:59,427 --> 01:06:00,917
Is that why you need the state troopers. Coach?

1057
01:06:00,995 --> 01:06:03,793
Look. I don't need no John Brown state troopers.

1058
01:06:03,865 --> 01:06:05,662
You can tell whoever threw this brick through my window.

1059
01:06:05,733 --> 01:06:08,463
They can come visit me anytime! I'll be at home.

1060
01:06:08,536 --> 01:06:12,097
I think it's time you stopped antagonizing everybody and learned a little humility.

1061
01:06:12,173 --> 01:06:13,162
Humility. Huh?

1062
01:06:13,241 --> 01:06:17,337
If you could just keep your mouth shut and didn't brag so much...

1063
01:06:17,412 --> 01:06:20,040
Oh. I see. So you're blaming me for what happened last night?

1064
01:06:20,114 --> 01:06:22,674
No. I am talking about setting a good example

1065
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:24,513
for our boys and for the community.

1066
01:06:24,585 --> 01:06:26,519
I don't scratch my head unless it itches.

1067
01:06:26,587 --> 01:06:29,681
And I don't dance unless I hear some music. I will not be intimidated.

1068
01:06:29,757 --> 01:06:30,746
That's just the way it is.

1069
01:06:30,825 --> 01:06:33,817
If you wanna carry your sinful pride with you to your grave. That's your business.

1070
01:06:33,895 --> 01:06:37,888
But when your sins endanger my little girl it becomes mine.

1071
01:06:37,966 --> 01:06:39,866
My sins?

1072
01:06:39,934 --> 01:06:43,461
You think my sins had something to do with what happened last night?

1073
01:06:43,538 --> 01:06:46,268
I'm sorry about what happened to your daughter. I really am.

1074
01:06:46,341 --> 01:06:51,176
But maybe you got a small taste of what my girls go through. Hm?

1075
01:06:51,245 --> 01:06:53,406
Welcome to my life. Yoast.

1076
01:07:02,390 --> 01:07:05,951
What's going on? Coach.

1077
01:07:08,229 --> 01:07:12,165
We wanted to let you know we was gonna warm up a little different tonight.

1078
01:07:12,233 --> 01:07:14,463
(announcer) This is the first true test of the season

1079
01:07:14,535 --> 01:07:16,799
for the undefeated T. C. Williams Titans.

1080
01:07:17,038 --> 01:07:21,475
'Cause tonight. They're going up against the undefeated Groveton Lions.

1081
01:07:22,143 --> 01:07:27,479
Their all-state noseguard Kip Tyler is as mean as a copperhead snake.

1082
01:07:28,349 --> 01:07:31,409
And here come the Titans!

1083
01:07:31,486 --> 01:07:37,447
They're playing in front of a capacity crowd for the first time this season.

1084
01:07:37,525 --> 01:07:38,651
Hoo-hah! We're here!

1085
01:07:38,726 --> 01:07:40,785

01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:51,970
Hoo-hah! Feels good!

1092
01:07:54,375 --> 01:07:57,105
Julius Campbell's playing strong-side linebacker.

1093
01:07:57,178 --> 01:08:00,204
He's so good. He's got all-American written all over him.

1094
01:08:00,281 --> 01:08:02,579
Sheryl! And Gerry Bertier...

1095
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:06,051

Five! Six! Five. Six. Seven. Eight!

Everywhere we go. Everywhere we go

01:08:14,062 --> 01:08:17,828
People wanna know. People wanna know

1099
01:08:17,899 --> 01:08:22,097
Who we are. Who we are

1100

01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:37,840
Ooh. Ah. Oh. Yeah

1105
01:08:37,919 --> 01:08:42,015
Who do they think they are. The Beatles?

1106
01:08:42,090 --> 01:08:44,684
All right. Quit gawking! Warm up!

1107
01:08:45,126 --> 01:08:47,253
Tyler. Coach?

1108
01:08:47,328 --> 01:08:49,228
Shut 'em up. Hard.

Song's over. Sambo!

1114
01:09:23,431 --> 01:09:25,592
What happened. Lastik? I audibled.

1115
01:09:25,666 --> 01:09:27,429
Rev. I swear to God. I audibled.

1116
01:09:27,502 --> 01:09:29,265
I didn't hear it. All right. Fellas. Coming through.

1117
01:09:29,337 --> 01:09:33,774
Swear to God. Let's take a look at that. Son.

1118
01:09:33,841 --> 01:09:38,005
He broke a bone in the wrist. He won't be throwing any more this season.

1119
01:09:38,079 --> 01:09:42,607
You got one minute. Coach. Take the other timeout. Coach.

1120
01:09:43,985 --> 01:09:46,749
Ronnie Bass! Coach. Rev's going back in. Right?

1121
01:09:46,821 --> 01:09:49,722
Not at quarterback. Son. I can't make that pitch. Coach.

1122
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:52,020
Yes. You can.

1123
01:09:52,093 --> 01:09:56,530
When I was 15 years old. I lost my mother and my father in the same month. Ronnie.

1124
01:09:56,597 --> 01:09:59,862
The same month. 12 brothers and sisters. I was the youngest one.

1125
01:09:59,934 --> 01:10:03,768
But they were all looking up to me. I wasn't ready yet. Either. But they needed me.

1126
01:10:03,838 --> 01:10:06,830
Your team needs you tonight. You're the Colonel.

1127
01:10:06,908 --> 01:10:08,705
You're gonna command your troops tonight. You understand?

1128
01:10:08,776 --> 01:10:13,475
Yes. Sir. Twins right. 48-0 read. Let's go.

1129
01:10:13,548 --> 01:10:14,537
Let's go.

1130
01:10:17,652 --> 01:10:20,678
What's the matter? Haven't you ever seen a football injury before. You wimps?

1131
01:10:20,755 --> 01:10:24,350
Let's go. Show some life in those legs. I got it. It's gonna be all right.

1132
01:10:24,425 --> 01:10:27,451
Budds. You release this time. Louie. Let him through. All right?

1133
01:10:27,528 --> 01:10:30,292
What? Just let him through. Trust me.

1134
01:10:30,364 --> 01:10:33,891
You had 12 brothers and sisters? Eight.

1135
01:10:33,968 --> 01:10:35,299
Yeah. 12 sounds better.

1136
01:10:39,273 --> 01:10:41,798
Ready!

1137
01:10:41,876 --> 01:10:43,434
Set!

1138
01:10:43,511 --> 01:10:45,741
Blue. 21! Blue. 21!

1139
01:10:45,813 --> 01:10:47,906
Hut!

1140
01:10:53,955 --> 01:10:55,786
Whoo!

1141
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:02,051
Ref! Unnecessary roughness! That's a penalty!

1142
01:11:02,096 --> 01:11:04,257
On the quarterback? Are you kidding me. Coach?

1143
01:11:09,203 --> 01:11:14,038
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Did you see that. Man? That's a bad white boy. Man.

1144
01:11:14,108 --> 01:11:15,598
Hike!

1145
01:11:20,948 --> 01:11:23,041
We've got ourselves a football player.

1146
01:11:23,117 --> 01:11:24,106
Hut!

1147
01:11:24,185 --> 01:11:29,418
Na na na na. Hey. Hey. Hey Goodbye

1148
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:31,856
Hut!

1149
01:11:31,926 --> 01:11:37,421
Na na na na. Hey. Hey. Hey Goodbye

1150
01:11:48,976 --> 01:11:52,070
All right. Listen up. Listen up. Listen up.

1151
01:11:52,146 --> 01:11:54,171
Listen up. Listen up. Listen up!

1152
01:11:54,248 --> 01:11:56,546
Whoa.

1153
01:11:56,617 --> 01:11:58,608
Game ball...

1154
01:11:59,687 --> 01:12:02,281
...Ronnie Bass.

1155
01:12:02,356 --> 01:12:03,789
Thank you.

1156
01:12:03,858 --> 01:12:08,192
Hey. This ball right here... hey. This ball right here goes to the real king right here.

1157
01:12:08,262 --> 01:12:11,720
Thanks for teaching me the veer. Rev. Aw. Come on.

1158
01:12:11,799 --> 01:12:16,668
Rev! Rev!...

1159
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:23,974
Coach. Can I speak with you in private?

1160
01:12:24,045 --> 01:12:26,343
Sure.

1161
01:12:27,515 --> 01:12:30,609
What's on your mind. Son?

1162
01:12:30,685 --> 01:12:34,519
I want Ray off the team. Coach.

1163
01:12:34,588 --> 01:12:37,318
You know my policy. Gerry. Yes. I do.

1164
01:12:37,391 --> 01:12:43,227
And I respect it. But I know that Ray missed that block on purpose.

1165
01:12:43,297 --> 01:12:47,358
Sometimes you just got to cut a man loose.

1166
01:12:47,435 --> 01:12:49,027
Mm.

1167
01:12:49,103 --> 01:12:52,004
Well. You're the captain.

1168
01:12:52,073 --> 01:12:56,339
You make a decision. But you support your decision.

1169
01:12:57,078 --> 01:12:59,410
We'll remember this one for a long time.

1170
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:02,938
Hey. Guys. Wait up. I want to catch a ride with you.

1171
01:13:03,017 --> 01:13:04,644
Ray?

1172
01:13:08,255 --> 01:13:10,951
You're out. What?

1173
01:13:11,025 --> 01:13:14,927
I'm not gonna let you play for this team anymore.

1174
01:13:16,364 --> 01:13:19,026
Oh. Yeah. Jerry Lewis?

1175
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:23,434
Gonna go and tell Coach Coon what to do. Just like last time?

1176
01:13:23,504 --> 01:13:28,373
But then that's right - he is your daddy now. Isn't he?

1177
01:13:28,442 --> 01:13:33,175
Boone don't cut anybody. Remember. Gerry?

1178
01:13:33,247 --> 01:13:35,738
I had you cut. Ray.

1179
01:13:35,783 --> 01:13:41,517
You willing to just throw away our friendship for them?

1180
01:13:42,189 --> 01:13:43,713
You can keep 'em.

1181
01:13:48,763 --> 01:13:51,698
"Cat Stevens" - "Peace Train"

1182
01:13:57,705 --> 01:13:58,694
Hi.

1183
01:13:58,773 --> 01:14:04,211
Now I've been happy lately thinking about the good things to come

1184
01:14:04,278 --> 01:14:10,183
And I believe it could be something good has begun

1185
01:14:10,251 --> 01:14:12,412
Oh. I've been smiling lately

1186
01:14:12,486 --> 01:14:16,354
O... Officer.

1187
01:14:17,224 --> 01:14:20,193
Heck of a game you boys played last night.

1188
01:14:20,261 --> 01:14:23,424
Thanks. Thank you. Officer.

1189
01:14:23,497 --> 01:14:27,797
Best defense I've seen in 20 years.

1190
01:14:27,868 --> 01:14:30,996
Tell that coach of yours to keep up the good work.

1191
01:14:31,071 --> 01:14:33,471
Oh. Yeah. I'll do that.

1192
01:14:33,541 --> 01:14:39,343
Now I've been smiling lately thinking about the good things to come

1193
01:14:42,783 --> 01:14:45,581
Yo. Man. Your taxi had a siren. Superman!

1194
01:14:45,653 --> 01:14:48,679
Hey. Man. What's going on? Doing all right.

1195
01:14:48,756 --> 01:14:50,747
Ride on the peace train

1196
01:14:50,825 --> 01:14:54,659
Ooh-ah-eee-ah-ooh-ah

1197
01:14:54,728 --> 01:14:57,219
Come on the peace train

1198
01:14:57,298 --> 01:15:00,392
Yes. Come on. Peace train

1199
01:15:00,468 --> 01:15:03,437
Yes. It's the peace train

1200
01:15:15,783 --> 01:15:17,774
Radio DJ:This song goes out to the undefeated Titans.

1201
01:15:17,851 --> 01:15:21,810
This city is alive with school spirit. Go get'em. Titans. Whoo!

1202
01:15:21,889 --> 01:15:25,381
Saturday night I was downtown.

1203
01:15:25,459 --> 01:15:28,826
Working for the FBI

1204
01:15:28,896 --> 01:15:31,888
Sitting in a nest of bad men

1205
01:15:31,965 --> 01:15:37,733
Whiskey bottles piling high

1206
01:15:37,805 --> 01:15:40,831
A pair of. 45s made me open my eyes

1207
01:15:40,908 --> 01:15:42,830
My temperature started to rise

1208
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:43,930


1209
01:15:45,913 --> 01:15:48,930
She was a long cool woman in a black dress

1210
01:15:49,030 --> 01:15:49,880


1211
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:53,182
Just a five-nine beautiful tall

1212
01:15:53,253 --> 01:15:56,347
With just one look I was a bad mess

1213
01:15:56,423 --> 01:15:59,130
'Cause that long cool woman had it all

1214
01:16:00,084 --> 01:16:01,430


1215
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:05,930


1216
01:16:08,268 --> 01:16:09,257
Whoo!

1217
01:16:09,530 --> 01:16:10,630


1218
01:16:12,130 --> 01:16:13,440


1219
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,972
Had it all

1220
01:16:16,476 --> 01:16:17,930


1221
01:16:20,147 --> 01:16:24,413
We are here tonight to honor men that are teaching our young people leadership.

1222
01:16:24,485 --> 01:16:28,444
On and off the field.And high moral standards as well.

1223
01:16:28,522 --> 01:16:33,885
Ladies and gentlemen. Let me introduce to you the 1971 Hall of Fame nominees.

1224
01:16:36,199 --> 01:16:38,463
Come on. Daddy.

1225
01:16:38,535 --> 01:16:39,900
Whoo!

1226
01:16:42,038 --> 01:16:45,530
When we played Jefferson. We were down by four with ten seconds left.

1227
01:16:45,608 --> 01:16:49,237
So. We blitzed the safety from the weak side...

1228
01:16:49,312 --> 01:16:52,645
Heck of a season the Titans are having. Coach.

1229
01:16:52,715 --> 01:16:56,913
Too bad it's got to end. Oh. We're still in it. Lyle.

1230
01:16:56,986 --> 01:17:00,285
Taber's boys are pretty good. But I think we'll take 'em in the regional.

1231
01:17:00,356 --> 01:17:03,848
Well. Not if we have anything to say about it.

1232
01:17:03,927 --> 01:17:09,176
You just leave this to us. Bill. Boone's out and you're head coach again.

1233
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:13,628
And all roads lead to the Hall of Fame.

1234
01:17:13,837 --> 01:17:16,237
Coach Taber? What do you think of the Titans. Coach?

1235
01:17:16,306 --> 01:17:19,139
Think you have a chance against that defense they have over there at T. C.?

1236
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:22,701
Ton. Billy. Ray. Come on over here.

1237
01:17:22,779 --> 01:17:26,078
Boys. These are my all-American tackles.

1238
01:17:26,149 --> 01:17:29,676
Prize bulls who don't do nothing but knock the chocolate out of folks.

1239
01:17:29,752 --> 01:17:32,915
Is it true you're not gonna trade films with Coach Boone?

1240
01:17:32,989 --> 01:17:36,948
I'm not gonna do anything to help that monkey.

1241
01:17:39,229 --> 01:17:44,599
Well. What we gonna do about this?

1242
01:17:44,667 --> 01:17:50,128
We're gonna get ready for Saturday. See you out there on the field.

1243
01:17:50,206 --> 01:17:52,197
Hut!

1244
01:17:57,847 --> 01:18:01,248
Hey. Mr. Official. Mr. Official. Can I talk to you for a second?

1245
01:18:01,317 --> 01:18:05,048
Back off. Coach. If you want to stay in this game.

1246
01:18:05,121 --> 01:18:06,110
Hut!

1247
01:18:07,524 --> 01:18:10,100


1248
01:18:10,226 --> 01:18:12,285
I've got holding on 78. white.

1249
01:18:12,362 --> 01:18:15,388
What are you? Are you trying to cheat my boys out of the game?

1250
01:18:15,465 --> 01:18:17,456
15 more yards. Unsportsmanlike conduct.

1251
01:18:19,302 --> 01:18:21,668
Let 'em play! Let the boys play!

1252
01:18:21,738 --> 01:18:22,727
Cheater! Coach. Come on.

1253
01:18:22,805 --> 01:18:25,000
Cheater! Coach!

1254
01:18:32,282 --> 01:18:33,772
Go. Go. Go. Go!

1255
01:18:38,421 --> 01:18:41,015
Oh. Come on! What was that?

1256
01:18:42,725 --> 01:18:45,990
What are you. Blind? That wasn't a hold!

1257
01:18:46,062 --> 01:18:49,725
Oh. Come on! That was such a bad call!

1258
01:18:52,569 --> 01:18:55,265
Titus!

1259
01:19:04,847 --> 01:19:07,645
I know all about it. Titus. What are you talking about. Bill?

1260
01:19:07,717 --> 01:19:11,585
You call this game fair or I'll go to the papers.

1261
01:19:11,654 --> 01:19:14,214
I don't care if I go down with ya.

1262
01:19:14,290 --> 01:19:19,626
But before God. I swear I'll see every last one of ya thrown in jail.

1263
01:19:19,696 --> 01:19:23,291
You dig your own grave. OK.

1264
01:19:23,366 --> 01:19:24,958
Defense! On me!

1265
01:19:25,902 --> 01:19:28,302
OK. Petey. Don't you drift to the strong side.

1266
01:19:28,371 --> 01:19:30,134
Coach. They're calling a holding penalty on me every time.

1267
01:19:30,206 --> 01:19:33,642
Did I ask for your excuses? You want to act like a star?

1268
01:19:33,710 --> 01:19:37,942
You better give me a star effort. Do you hear me?

1269
01:19:38,815 --> 01:19:43,752
Forget about him! Alan. You're in! Come on!

1270
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:48,951
All right. Now. I don't want them to gain another yard.

1271
01:19:49,025 --> 01:19:51,653
You blitz all night!

1272
01:19:51,728 --> 01:19:55,323
If they cross the line of scrimmage. I'm gonna take every last one of ya out!

1273
01:19:55,398 --> 01:20:02,167
You make sure they remember forever the night they played the Titans.

1274
01:20:02,772 --> 01:20:04,467
Yeah!

1275
01:20:05,475 --> 01:20:08,103
Leave no doubt!

1276
01:20:09,045 --> 01:20:11,343
Set! Come on. Y'all! Swing it left!

1277
01:20:11,414 --> 01:20:13,006
Swing it left!

1278
01:20:14,050 --> 01:20:16,712
Set! Hut!

1279
01:20:24,961 --> 01:20:28,192
You better make yourself comfortable down there. Real comfortable.

1280
01:20:55,892 --> 01:20:58,383
"Ike and Tina Turner" - "I Want to Take You Higher"

1281
01:20:58,461 --> 01:21:01,157
That one was for you. Coach. All right. Baby. All right.

1282
01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:05,999
You brought us here. Coach. Run it up. Herman! Leave no doubt!

1283
01:21:08,337 --> 01:21:12,068
Music's in your city too

1284
01:21:12,141 --> 01:21:17,408
Music's gettin' good to me But now don't ya. I said don't ya

1285
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,971
Don't ya want to get higher?

1286
01:21:20,049 --> 01:21:21,778
Hut! Hut! Hut!

1287
01:21:21,851 --> 01:21:24,581
Don't ya want to get higher?

1288
01:21:24,654 --> 01:21:28,954
Baby. Baby. Let me light your fire

1289
01:21:29,025 --> 01:21:32,222
Ooo. Ha little bit higher

1290
01:21:34,430 --> 01:21:35,829
Good game.

1291
01:21:39,802 --> 01:21:43,101
Coach? Coach.

1292
01:21:43,172 --> 01:21:45,072
I took a straw poll.

1293
01:21:45,975 --> 01:21:49,638
You just lost yourself the Hall of Fame.

1294
01:21:56,286 --> 01:21:57,344
Good game. Y'all.

1295
01:21:58,221 --> 01:22:01,315
Hey. Good job. 43. Good job. Good job. Men. Good job.

1296
01:22:01,391 --> 01:22:04,189
Hey. Way to stick. Good job.

1297
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:06,956
Good game. Coach.

1298
01:22:09,399 --> 01:22:11,196
Coach?

1299
01:22:20,443 --> 01:22:23,173
(cheering. Whistling)

1300
01:22:33,289 --> 01:22:35,223
Yeah!

1301
01:22:36,059 --> 01:22:40,860
Petey. What happened out there. Man? Come on. Talk to me. Petey.

1302
01:22:40,930 --> 01:22:43,524
Petey! Come on.

1303
01:22:44,133 --> 01:22:48,536
Hey. Julius. Julius! Come here. Man.

1304
01:22:48,605 --> 01:22:50,197
Don't move. Go. It's OK.

1305
01:22:50,273 --> 01:22:52,002
Man. What's up. Man?

1306
01:22:52,075 --> 01:22:54,737
Let's get out of here. Let's go paint the town or something.

1307
01:22:54,811 --> 01:22:57,336
Let's go. Let's go. I got to hang with my girl tonight.

1308
01:22:57,413 --> 01:22:59,244
I got to hang with her tonight. All right. All right.

1309
01:22:59,315 --> 01:23:03,342
Where you going? I don't know.

1310
01:23:03,419 --> 01:23:05,478
I don't know. But I'm gonna go. All right?

1311
01:23:05,555 --> 01:23:06,817
You gonna go? Yeah. Man.

1312
01:23:06,889 --> 01:23:08,857
I want to go. Man. But you know what I mean. Man.

1313
01:23:08,925 --> 01:23:09,914
I'll see ya.

1314
01:23:23,673 --> 01:23:27,040
Looks like you weren't the one with the mixed-up priorities. Huh?

1315
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:29,044
Emma...

1316
01:23:29,112 --> 01:23:33,071
I think it's gonna take me a little longer than you might like.

1317
01:23:33,149 --> 01:23:35,344
But. Um...

1318
01:23:36,386 --> 01:23:39,878
I just wanted you to know that I'm gonna try.

1319
01:23:43,292 --> 01:23:45,624
Goodbye. Gerry.

1320
01:23:47,597 --> 01:23:51,693
Emma? Make me a promise?

1321
01:23:52,168 --> 01:23:55,467
You'll be there to root for us when we play Marshall for the title?

1322
01:23:55,538 --> 01:23:59,201
"James Taylor" - "Fire and Rain"

1323
01:24:01,878 --> 01:24:04,108
Just yesterday morning...

1324
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:08,549
I know how much it meant to you.

1325
01:24:08,618 --> 01:24:11,746
I ain't gonna lie.

1326
01:24:11,821 --> 01:24:14,688
I wanted the Hall of Fame real bad.

1327
01:24:14,757 --> 01:24:19,194
Just plain old jealousy. As old as Cain and Abel.

1328
01:24:19,262 --> 01:24:23,289
You know what? I wanted it. Too.

1329
01:24:23,366 --> 01:24:27,427
But there's always next year or the year after that.

1330
01:24:27,503 --> 01:24:32,099
As long as it takes for them to wise up. Wouldn't want it now. Anyway.

1331
01:24:32,175 --> 01:24:34,200
Bunch of old rednecks.

1332
01:24:40,683 --> 01:24:43,083
Let's knock 'em dead at State. Coach.

1333
01:24:43,152 --> 01:24:47,054
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

1334
01:24:47,123 --> 01:24:50,217
You're home! You're home! Gonna come home to my girls.

1335
01:24:50,293 --> 01:24:52,921
Give me a kiss. Mwah!

1336
01:24:52,995 --> 01:24:55,020
Congratulations. Herman. All right.

1337
01:24:55,098 --> 01:24:57,123
Mmm. What'd I tell you. Baby. Huh?

1338
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:59,794
Yeah. We can't get too far ahead of ourselves.

1339
01:24:59,869 --> 01:25:03,498
We still got... still got to get Ed Henry and Marshall.

1340
01:25:03,573 --> 01:25:06,064
We got all these...You done a good job!

1341
01:25:06,109 --> 01:25:07,667
Congratulations!

1342
01:25:07,744 --> 01:25:09,541
Whoo-hoo!

1343
01:25:16,486 --> 01:25:20,855
Well. I'll be John Brown. We cleaned up the kitchen. Daddy.

1344
01:25:20,923 --> 01:25:23,790
So you could get right to work.

1345
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:28,126
You did? Well. I got news for you.

1346
01:25:28,197 --> 01:25:30,290
I ain't working tonight. Tonight we're gonna celebrate.

1347
01:25:30,366 --> 01:25:32,300
We're gonna let these people know who's gonna win State. Right?

1348
01:25:32,368 --> 01:25:32,993
- Right. - Right?

1349
01:25:33,069 --> 01:25:33,797
- Right! - Right!

1350
01:25:33,870 --> 01:25:34,564
- Right! - Right!

1351
01:25:34,637 --> 01:25:36,901
Right! Whoo!

1352
01:25:36,973 --> 01:25:38,998
Tell everybody! We're gonna win State!

1353
01:25:39,075 --> 01:25:40,599
Whoo!

1354
01:25:40,676 --> 01:25:43,543
We're gonna win State!

1355
01:25:44,881 --> 01:25:46,712
We're gonna win State!

1356
01:25:46,783 --> 01:25:51,186
I've seen fire and I've seen rain

1357
01:25:51,254 --> 01:25:55,782
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end

1358
01:25:57,527 --> 01:26:01,793
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend

1359
01:26:03,733 --> 01:26:06,099
But I always thought that I'd see you...

1360
01:26:06,169 --> 01:26:07,363
Gerry! You're the man!

1361
01:26:07,436 --> 01:26:09,734
No. You. You.

1362
01:26:09,806 --> 01:26:11,501
Yeah!

1363
01:26:20,383 --> 01:26:21,714
(horn blares)

1364
01:26:21,784 --> 01:26:23,752
Oh. Jesus! Gerry!

1365
01:26:45,508 --> 01:26:48,671
How ya doing. Son? He ain't all right? He all right?

1366
01:26:48,744 --> 01:26:51,508
He's. Um... How's he doing?

1367
01:26:53,816 --> 01:26:56,751
Not too good. Not too good.

1368
01:26:56,819 --> 01:27:00,755
How well is he doing? How bad is it?

1369
01:27:00,823 --> 01:27:04,259
How bad is it? He's paralyzed from the waist down.

1370
01:27:04,994 --> 01:27:09,192
Don't say that to me. Don't say that to me!

1371
01:27:13,202 --> 01:27:16,000
I'm sorry. Mrs. Bertier.

1372
01:27:16,072 --> 01:27:19,303
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1373
01:27:20,443 --> 01:27:23,708
He doesn't want to see anybody but you. Julius.

1374
01:27:23,779 --> 01:27:26,839
Yes. Ma'am. You be strong.

1375
01:27:26,916 --> 01:27:28,247
Yes. Ma'am.

1376
01:27:28,317 --> 01:27:32,310
Those tears are not gonna make my boy walk again.

1377
01:27:42,632 --> 01:27:48,036
Only kin's allowed in here. Alice. Are you blind?

1378
01:27:48,104 --> 01:27:51,335
Don't you see the family resemblance?

1379
01:27:52,141 --> 01:27:55,599
That's my brother.

1380
01:27:56,245 --> 01:27:57,974
All right.

1381
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:13,394
Oh. Man.

1382
01:28:13,462 --> 01:28:16,454
You think I look banged up. You should see my Camaro.

1383
01:28:16,532 --> 01:28:21,435
Man. I sure am sorry. Man.

1384
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:24,268
I should have been there with you.

1385
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:27,366
What are you talking about?

1386
01:28:27,443 --> 01:28:31,072
You would've been in the bed right next to me.

1387
01:28:31,147 --> 01:28:35,083
You can't be hurt like this.

1388
01:28:35,151 --> 01:28:38,086
You... You're Superman.

1389
01:28:44,994 --> 01:28:47,929
I was afraid of you. Julius.

1390
01:28:50,199 --> 01:28:53,396
I only saw what I was afraid of.

1391
01:28:54,337 --> 01:28:57,864
And now I know I was only hating my brother.

1392
01:28:59,642 --> 01:29:01,837
I'll tell you what. Though.

1393
01:29:01,911 --> 01:29:06,109
Um. When all this is over.

1394
01:29:06,182 --> 01:29:09,447
Me and you are gonna move out to the same neighborhood together.

1395
01:29:09,518 --> 01:29:11,110
OK?

1396
01:29:12,121 --> 01:29:16,148
And we'll get old and we'll get fat.

1397
01:29:16,225 --> 01:29:20,059
And there ain't gonna be all this black white between us.

1398
01:29:26,302 --> 01:29:28,361
Left side.

1399
01:29:29,438 --> 01:29:31,463
Strong side.

1400
01:29:31,530 --> 01:29:33,030


1401
01:29:39,215 --> 01:29:42,616
Good morning. Good morning.

1402
01:29:42,685 --> 01:29:46,712
Uh. The Marshall film. Well. That's good.

1403
01:29:46,789 --> 01:29:49,485
We're gonna have to be real sharp

1404
01:29:49,558 --> 01:29:53,085
on the offensive and defensive sides of the football.

1405
01:29:53,162 --> 01:29:55,426
Figure we give the kids a couple of extra practices this week.

1406
01:29:55,498 --> 01:29:58,695
Make sure they stay focused.

1407
01:29:58,768 --> 01:30:02,761
Got a press conference today at 12... Press conference?

1408
01:30:02,838 --> 01:30:05,932
Listen. What we do here amongst ourselves is one thing.

1409
01:30:06,008 --> 01:30:08,272
But we are not gonna parade around...

1410
01:30:08,344 --> 01:30:10,904
Hold on. Hold on. I'm not talking about parading.

1411
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:15,246
I'm talking about going out there. Presenting a strong. United front.

1412
01:30:15,317 --> 01:30:19,253
Now. I'm hurting... just like you are. Yoast.

1413
01:30:19,321 --> 01:30:22,119
But the season is not over yet.

1414
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:27,324
I didn't... We did not come this far to just break down and lose now.

1415
01:30:27,396 --> 01:30:31,526
Everything's not always about winning and losing.

1416
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:34,296
I'm a winner.

1417
01:30:34,370 --> 01:30:36,361
I'm going to win.

1418
01:30:36,439 --> 01:30:42,071
Is this even about football anymore? Or is it just about you?

1419
01:30:43,145 --> 01:30:47,343
Coach Boone. Coach. You lost Bertier.

1420
01:30:47,416 --> 01:30:49,008
Is your defense in trouble?

1421
01:30:49,085 --> 01:30:53,852
You cannot replace a Gerry Bertier...

1422
01:30:53,923 --> 01:30:57,484
...as a player or person.

1423
01:31:01,464 --> 01:31:03,864
I don't know. Mama.

1424
01:31:08,037 --> 01:31:10,767
Maybe Yoast was right. Maybe I pushed 'em too hard.

1425
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:13,331
Gerry had an accident.

1426
01:31:15,111 --> 01:31:20,048
Sometimes life's just hard. For no reason at all.

1427
01:31:20,116 --> 01:31:22,744
You think I was blinded by my own ambition?

1428
01:31:22,818 --> 01:31:25,582
Mm.

1429
01:31:25,654 --> 01:31:31,092
Whatever kind of ambition it took to do what you did around here.

1430
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:34,687
This world could use a lot more of it. Herman.

1431
01:31:45,641 --> 01:31:49,042
Hey. Coach. How ya doing?

1432
01:31:55,417 --> 01:31:57,112
This for me?

1433
01:31:58,454 --> 01:32:02,413
I want you to be my eyes out there. All right?

1434
01:32:02,491 --> 01:32:05,790
Any of these guys slack off. You just let me know.

1435
01:32:06,495 --> 01:32:09,157
You bet I will.

1436
01:32:10,499 --> 01:32:13,559
How ya doing. Gerry? I'm all right. Coach.

1437
01:32:13,636 --> 01:32:15,695
I was talking with these guys about Marshall. Trying...

1438
01:32:15,771 --> 01:32:18,535
You know what? We don't need to talk about football right now. Gerry.

1439
01:32:18,607 --> 01:32:22,134
I think this is a good time for reflection and for prayer.

1440
01:32:22,211 --> 01:32:25,647
Coach? I'm hurt.

1441
01:32:25,714 --> 01:32:28,205
I ain't dead.

1442
01:32:28,284 --> 01:32:31,583
No. You're not. No. You're not.

1443
01:32:33,155 --> 01:32:37,057
You know. I've been reading up on the activities that they got

1444
01:32:37,126 --> 01:32:39,959
for people in wheelchairs and such.

1445
01:32:40,629 --> 01:32:42,859
They got Olympics.

1446
01:32:42,932 --> 01:32:44,627
(crowd cheering)

1447
01:32:45,868 --> 01:32:49,861
This is the granddaddy of state-high-school football championships.

1448
01:32:49,939 --> 01:32:54,706
The Virginia Triple-A. It just doesn't get any better.

1449
01:32:54,777 --> 01:32:58,907
We have Coach Herman Boone's Titans versus the legend. Ed Henry.

1450
01:32:58,981 --> 01:33:02,940
With over 250 wins in 30 years.

1451
01:33:04,787 --> 01:33:07,017
Amen.Let's go!

1452
01:33:12,595 --> 01:33:14,392
Lastik. What's the matter?

1453
01:33:15,464 --> 01:33:16,954
I'm eligible.

1454
01:33:18,934 --> 01:33:22,495
Well. I'm glad to hear that. Son. But I'm already married.

1455
01:33:22,571 --> 01:33:25,802
I got a C-plus average. Coach.

1456
01:33:27,243 --> 01:33:29,609
I'm going to college.

1457
01:33:29,678 --> 01:33:31,873
That's fantastic.

1458
01:33:31,947 --> 01:33:36,316
Coach? Coach. I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

1459
01:33:36,385 --> 01:33:38,751
You abandoned your team in their moment of need. Petey.

1460
01:33:38,821 --> 01:33:41,187
Sorry won't make up for that. Yeah. I know. But listen.

1461
01:33:41,257 --> 01:33:44,715
I want to play for you. I want to play for the championship.

1462
01:33:44,793 --> 01:33:47,956
You can play for me next year. You sit on that bench.

1463
01:33:48,030 --> 01:33:50,021
Show me you can support your teammates.

1464
01:33:50,099 --> 01:33:53,296
You'll start again as a senior.

1465
01:33:59,708 --> 01:34:02,700
Entering the stadium now is Jean Bertier.

1466
01:34:02,778 --> 01:34:07,078
And she's the mother of injured all-American linebacker. Gerry Bertier.

1467
01:34:07,149 --> 01:34:11,085
And the Titan fans are really giving her a warm reception.

1468
01:34:17,359 --> 01:34:22,262
Gerry! Gerry! Gerry!...

1469
01:34:26,468 --> 01:34:29,028
(chanting continues)

1470
01:34:37,513 --> 01:34:39,344
And here come the Titans.

1471
01:34:39,415 --> 01:34:42,851
Entering the stadium in what's become their own unique style.

1472
01:34:42,918 --> 01:34:44,783
We're here! Hoo-hah!

1473
01:34:44,853 --> 01:34:46,514
Feels good! Hoo-hah!

1474
01:34:46,588 --> 01:34:48,283
We're here! Hoo-hah!

1475
01:34:48,357 --> 01:34:49,847
Feels good! Hoo-hah!

1476
01:34:49,892 --> 01:34:51,951
We're here! Hoo-hah!

1477
01:34:52,027 --> 01:34:53,858
Feels good! Hoo-hah!

1478
01:34:53,929 --> 01:34:55,556
We're here! Hoo-hah!

1479
01:34:55,631 --> 01:34:57,496
Feels good! Hoo-hah!

1480
01:35:06,775 --> 01:35:08,766
Julius Campbell?

1481
01:35:10,779 --> 01:35:13,976
Hi. I'm Emma Hoyt. Oh.

1482
01:35:14,049 --> 01:35:15,880
Well. I guess we never met. Huh?

1483
01:35:15,951 --> 01:35:17,543
Excuse me. Young lady. You can't be here right now.

1484
01:35:17,619 --> 01:35:20,383
You're gonna have to get back to your seat.

1485
01:35:22,725 --> 01:35:25,353
Well. Now we've met.

1486
01:35:25,427 --> 01:35:29,193
Yeah. It's nice to meet you. Good luck. Julius.

1487
01:35:29,264 --> 01:35:31,391
Two. 21! Whoa. Wait!

1488
01:35:31,467 --> 01:35:33,332
What the hell's going on? 24!

1489
01:35:33,402 --> 01:35:36,565
Shotgun. Who do they think they are? The New York Jets?

1490
01:35:36,638 --> 01:35:38,629
Switch! Switch! Get nine!

1491
01:35:38,707 --> 01:35:40,072
Switch! Switch! Get nine!

1492
01:35:40,142 --> 01:35:42,133
Bosley. Move! Where's Bosley?

1493
01:35:42,211 --> 01:35:46,170
Line up! Get Bosley! Get nine. Get nine!

1494
01:35:46,248 --> 01:35:47,545
All right!

1495
01:35:47,616 --> 01:35:49,550
Hut. Hut!

1496
01:35:54,356 --> 01:35:56,324
Real good. Keep it up. Shotgun only.

1497
01:35:57,159 --> 01:35:59,593
Cover three! Go to cover three! Pass!

1498
01:35:59,661 --> 01:36:01,253
Hut!

1499
01:36:10,806 --> 01:36:13,400
Put some pressure on that Q.B. They got all day to throw. Coach.

1500
01:36:13,475 --> 01:36:15,238
You just worry about your offense.

1501
01:36:17,413 --> 01:36:19,574
Let's go! Swing it! Swing it!

1502
01:36:19,782 --> 01:36:21,010
Set! All right. Set.

1503
01:36:21,083 --> 01:36:22,880
Get set. Hut!

1504
01:36:29,591 --> 01:36:31,559
So Marshall... No!

1505
01:36:31,627 --> 01:36:35,427
What's wrong. Gerry? Do not come in here!

1506
01:36:37,299 --> 01:36:40,359
They got receivers everywhere. It's like watching Monday Night Football.

1507
01:36:40,436 --> 01:36:42,267
Good hustle. Good hustle. Good hustle!

1508
01:36:42,337 --> 01:36:44,202
Just give him a little cushion. Just give him a little cushion.

1509
01:36:44,273 --> 01:36:45,900
And when they throw that ball. You stick him!

1510
01:36:45,974 --> 01:36:47,999
Ready? Break!

1511
01:36:49,611 --> 01:36:51,545
Ready!

1512
01:36:51,613 --> 01:36:53,376
Red. 57!

1513
01:36:53,449 --> 01:36:55,542
Red. 57!

1514
01:36:55,617 --> 01:36:58,586
Hut. Hut. Hut!

1515
01:37:02,858 --> 01:37:07,886
Titans star quarterback Ronnie Bass gains six yards.

1516
01:37:07,963 --> 01:37:09,726
What you think? You think we got a chance?

1517
01:37:09,798 --> 01:37:12,631
Got to give me some way to disguise that cover. Just start thinking about it. Let's go.

1518
01:37:13,402 --> 01:37:17,099
Ready! Set! Hut!

1519
01:37:27,316 --> 01:37:30,251
They're a mile ahead of us. He's a mile ahead of you. Coach.

1520
01:37:30,319 --> 01:37:33,254
If your defense would stop somebody. We'd get the ball a little more.

1521
01:37:33,322 --> 01:37:37,622
Well. The Titans gave 'em a scare. But Ed Henry looks supremely confident.

1522
01:37:37,693 --> 01:37:41,720
T. C. Williams goes in at the half trailing 7-0.

1523
01:37:41,797 --> 01:37:43,389
Coach!

1524
01:37:43,465 --> 01:37:45,490
Sweetheart. You better get back to your seat.

1525
01:37:45,567 --> 01:37:47,432
- I can't. - Coach. What?

1526
01:37:47,503 --> 01:37:49,630
Ed Henry's got Boone's number. Sure as shooting.

1527
01:37:49,705 --> 01:37:53,732
And you ain't doing nothing against that shotgun.

1528
01:37:53,809 --> 01:37:57,074
Look. Coach. Now ain't the time to be proud.

1529
01:37:57,546 --> 01:37:59,673
All right. We're in a fight.

1530
01:38:00,883 --> 01:38:06,321
You boys are doing all that you can do. Anybody can see that.

1531
01:38:06,388 --> 01:38:09,619
Win or lose.

1532
01:38:09,691 --> 01:38:15,323
We're gonna walk out of this stadium tonight with our heads held high.

1533
01:38:15,397 --> 01:38:18,889
Do your best. That's all anybody can ask for.

1534
01:38:18,967 --> 01:38:22,801
No. It ain't. Coach. With all due respect.

1535
01:38:22,871 --> 01:38:26,637
You demanded more of us. You demanded perfection.

1536
01:38:26,708 --> 01:38:30,405
Now. I ain't saying that I'm perfect. 'Cause I'm not.

1537
01:38:30,479 --> 01:38:33,141
And I ain't gonna never be. None of us are.

1538
01:38:33,215 --> 01:38:37,242
But we have won every single game we have played till now.

1539
01:38:37,319 --> 01:38:40,652
So this team is perfect.

1540
01:38:40,722 --> 01:38:43,953
We stepped out on that field that way tonight.

1541
01:38:44,026 --> 01:38:47,018
And if it's all the same to you. Coach Boone.

1542
01:38:47,095 --> 01:38:49,154
That's how we want to leave it.

1543
01:38:49,231 --> 01:38:50,528
Yeah.

1544
01:38:50,599 --> 01:38:53,625
I hope you boys have learned as much from me this year

1545
01:38:53,702 --> 01:38:55,932
as I've learned from you.

1546
01:38:56,004 --> 01:39:01,135
You've taught this city how to trust the soul of a man rather than the look of him.

1547
01:39:01,209 --> 01:39:04,474
And I guess it's about time I joined the club.

1548
01:39:04,546 --> 01:39:09,609
Herman. I sure could use your help. Ed Henry's kicking my ass out there.

1549
01:39:09,785 --> 01:39:12,276
Listen up. This is our time now.

1550
01:39:12,321 --> 01:39:15,688
Second half is our time! We're gonna make some changes on defense.

1551
01:39:15,757 --> 01:39:20,023
They're spreading us out too far. We're gonna put Sunshine. Alan.

1552
01:39:20,095 --> 01:39:24,361
Glascoe. Davis. You're gonna play both ways. Rest of the game.

1553
01:39:24,433 --> 01:39:27,402
I don't want a receiver to get across that line of scrimmage.

1554
01:39:27,469 --> 01:39:29,801
Coach Yoast will tell you where you're playing. All right?

1555
01:39:29,871 --> 01:39:33,466
Let's go. It's our time. Everybody in. Our time! Our time! Our time!

1556
01:39:33,542 --> 01:39:36,340
Titans on three. One. Two. Three! Titans!

1557
01:39:36,411 --> 01:39:39,244
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

1558
01:39:39,314 --> 01:39:41,942
All right. Julius? We're gonna go 52 monster.

1559
01:39:42,017 --> 01:39:43,541
I know that's all you need to know. All right.

1560
01:39:43,619 --> 01:39:46,417
All right. We're going zone. Alan. Sir. I can play with Roosevelt.

1561
01:39:46,488 --> 01:39:50,219
But I cannot play with these guys.

1562
01:39:50,292 --> 01:39:51,953
No. I tell you what. I didn't warm the bench all year

1563
01:39:52,027 --> 01:39:57,966
so I could watch us go down on my account. Put Petey in. He's better.

1564
01:39:58,033 --> 01:40:02,970
You want him to take your spot. You go give it to him.

1565
01:40:03,038 --> 01:40:05,029
Thank you.

1566
01:40:14,916 --> 01:40:18,113
"Creedence Clearwater Revival" - "Up Around the Bend"

1567
01:40:19,187 --> 01:40:21,951
Good job. Petey! All right! That was beautiful.

1568
01:40:23,592 --> 01:40:25,423
Offense. Let's go.

1569
01:40:25,494 --> 01:40:27,928
There's a place up ahead and I'm going

1570
01:40:27,996 --> 01:40:31,762
Just as fast as my feet can fly

1571
01:40:31,833 --> 01:40:35,291
Come away. Come away if you're going

1572
01:40:35,370 --> 01:40:38,931
Leave the sinking ship behind

1573
01:40:39,007 --> 01:40:44,309
Come on the rising wind We're going up around the bend

1574
01:40:44,379 --> 01:40:47,974
All right. Defense? Get out there! Let's go! Stop 'em!

1575
01:40:49,317 --> 01:40:50,614
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go!

1576
01:40:50,686 --> 01:40:55,680
...for the banjo Better get while the getting's good

1577
01:40:55,757 --> 01:41:00,524
Hitch a ride to the end of the highway

1578
01:41:00,595 --> 01:41:03,564
O-two. Inside veer. O-two inside veer.

1579
01:41:04,066 --> 01:41:06,261
Hut!

1580
01:41:06,334 --> 01:41:10,361
They're going up around the bend

1581
01:41:11,873 --> 01:41:16,037
You can ponder perpetual motion

1582
01:41:16,111 --> 01:41:20,707
It's a field-goal attempt for T. C. Williams. It's good!

1583
01:41:24,119 --> 01:41:28,180
So. They trail Marshall 7-3 heading into the fourth quarter.

1584
01:41:28,256 --> 01:41:31,521
Ref! He's lining up offside! Look. 48's offside!

1585
01:41:31,593 --> 01:41:33,151
Freeze right. 99-Z. Go.

1586
01:41:33,228 --> 01:41:34,820
Ref. I know you can see him. You got eyes!

1587
01:41:34,896 --> 01:41:39,560
Gun right. 84-X. Flat. And tell Tommy to watch the free safety. Let's go.

1588
01:41:39,634 --> 01:41:43,195
Get right in there. Blue. You know who I'm talking about.

1589
01:41:43,271 --> 01:41:46,206
He's offside! He's lining up offside!

1590
01:41:46,274 --> 01:41:49,675
Got to hold them here. Defense! Hold 'em right here!

1591
01:41:49,745 --> 01:41:52,043
Whoa. Pass! Pass!

1592
01:41:52,914 --> 01:41:55,542
Let's go. Offense. Let's go.

1593
01:41:58,653 --> 01:42:01,918
Break!Titans trail Marshall 7-3.

1594
01:42:01,990 --> 01:42:04,322
All Marshall has to do is hold onto the ball

1595
01:42:04,392 --> 01:42:06,883
and they will be the state champions.

1596
01:42:06,962 --> 01:42:10,489
Watch 'em on the left side! On the left side!

1597
01:42:23,879 --> 01:42:26,143
Hold onto that ball. Petey!

1598
01:42:27,048 --> 01:42:28,913
Hold the ball! Hold the ball!

1599
01:42:28,984 --> 01:42:31,248
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Hold it! Hold it!

1600
01:42:31,319 --> 01:42:36,655
Hold onto that ball! Hold onto that ball. Petey!

1601
01:42:37,726 --> 01:42:39,956
All right. Petey!

1602
01:42:42,197 --> 01:42:43,687
Coach. Get a timeout! Timeout!

1603
01:42:43,732 --> 01:42:45,529
Coach. They're slanting to our strong side every time.

1604
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:47,659
You got to catch 'em in that slant and let 'em overpursue.

1605
01:42:47,736 --> 01:42:52,571
He's onto your game. You got to throw something at him he's not ready for.

1606
01:42:52,641 --> 01:42:54,905
Rev! Where's Rev? Yes. Sir.

1607
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:57,137
All right. Listen. You ready to run? Yes. Sir.

1608
01:42:57,212 --> 01:43:02,047
Fake 23 blast with a backside George reverse. You got that?

1609
01:43:02,117 --> 01:43:05,951
Fake 23 blast with a backside George reverse. Like your life depended upon it.

1610
01:43:06,021 --> 01:43:08,114
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go get 'em.

1611
01:43:08,190 --> 01:43:13,958
The Titans take the field with time to run one final play for the state championship.

1612
01:43:14,029 --> 01:43:17,430
I thought he was injured. I guess not.

1613
01:43:17,499 --> 01:43:19,490
Why are they bringing in a Q. B?

1614
01:43:19,568 --> 01:43:22,332
Titans have 75 yards to get to the end zone.

1615
01:43:22,404 --> 01:43:25,931
Oh. My gosh. I can't watch this. I can't watch this.

1616
01:43:26,007 --> 01:43:26,769
- What? - No.

1617
01:43:26,842 --> 01:43:30,243
- What? Sheryl. What's wrong? - No. I can't watch it.

1618
01:43:30,312 --> 01:43:32,803
No. It's too late. Not now. Not now.

1619
01:43:36,384 --> 01:43:38,716
They're gonna throw it deep. Cover deep!

1620
01:43:38,787 --> 01:43:42,120
Down! Watch the deep pass! Cover it deep!

1621
01:43:42,190 --> 01:43:44,181
Set! Hut!

1622
01:44:25,667 --> 01:44:29,194
Well. That's it. Boys. That's it.

1623
01:44:29,271 --> 01:44:31,034
Good season. It's all right.

1624
01:44:32,173 --> 01:44:34,334
Yes! Yes! Come on.

1625
01:44:38,847 --> 01:44:40,178
Congratulations. Coach. Thank you.

1626
01:44:40,248 --> 01:44:41,875
You did a good job. Played a fine game.

1627
01:44:43,485 --> 01:44:47,683
I know football. But what you did with those boys...

1628
01:44:47,756 --> 01:44:51,123
You were the right man for the job. Coach.

1629
01:44:51,192 --> 01:44:53,854
You're a Hall of Famer in my book.

1630
01:44:58,166 --> 01:45:00,794
Yay!

1631
01:45:02,337 --> 01:45:04,567
Whoo-hoo!

1632
01:45:06,207 --> 01:45:08,767
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1633
01:45:09,778 --> 01:45:12,804
Yeah! Whoo!

1634
01:45:19,554 --> 01:45:24,287
The Titans danced their way into history. 13 and O.The perfect season.

1635
01:45:24,359 --> 01:45:28,056
State champions and first runner-up for the National Championship.

1636
01:45:28,129 --> 01:45:31,030
Second best high-school team in the country.

1637
01:45:31,099 --> 01:45:34,728
Gerry Bertier won a gold medal for the shot put in the wheelchair games.

1638
01:45:34,803 --> 01:45:37,101
Daddy coached him.

1639
01:45:39,674 --> 01:45:42,404
Ten years later. Gerry died. And that's what brought us back here today.

1640
01:45:42,477 --> 01:45:46,538
Gerry is gone. But his spirit lives on.

1641
01:45:46,614 --> 01:45:49,481
People say that it can't work. Black and white.

1642
01:45:49,551 --> 01:45:52,145
Well. Here we make it work every day.

1643
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:54,654
We have our disagreements. Of course.

1644
01:45:54,723 --> 01:46:00,184
But before we reach for hate. Always. Always we remember the Titans.

1645
