1
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,393
Changing Times

2
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:10,059
Where's everybody?

3
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:12,861
- You know, it's Sunday.
- What do you mean, it's Sunday?

4
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,866
You know we need
to get things moving.

5
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,766
Why aren't they working?

6
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,064
Let's go!

7
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,003
Hurry "P!

8
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:26,733
Thank you.

9
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:34,646
Welcome to Tangiers.
I am Nabila Balouch.

10
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:36,409
Hello, Nabila.

11
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,209
- Did you have a good trip?
- Yes.

12
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:43,779
Things didn't go well in Marbella.
They disagree with the estimate.

13
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,859
Is that your only luggage?

14
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,793
Yes, I am not a tourist.
I am a traveller.

15
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:53,793
One of the issues we had
with this project

16
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,393
was to design
a perfectly insulated building.

17
00:03:56,503 --> 00:04:02,033
It's only 550 yards from an airport
supporting big commercial airplanes.

18
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:06,602
So, the facade is insulated
with double-glazing windows,

19
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:10,843
the interior has false ceilings
made of mineral flagstones,

20
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:14,751
and, for the most part, the stones
on the floor are carpeted.

21
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,823
Christian is better suited to tell you

22
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:20,360
how things are going inside
the building, on the technical side.

23
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,158
How does last minute information
get broadcasted live?

24
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,892
Where are the teleprompters
and the telexes?

25
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,990
Are they at the same level?

26
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,660
By the way,
you haven't forgotten the flowers?

27
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,534
A daily bouquet since last week.

28
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:34,573
- No signature.
- That's perfect.

29
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:35,836
Roses every time, right?

30
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,741
Yes, but you haven't
told me which colour.

31
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:39,904
- I thought red was too daring.
- Be daring then, Nabila.

32
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:43,711
So light will go
through the window anyway?

33
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:46,752
Yes. There will be light,
but it will be dimmed.

34
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:51,087
Behind the window, we'll have blinds,
something like that.

35
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:53,922
This building
must be able to function 2417.

36
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:54,653
Is it facing north?

37
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,389
Yes, it is facing north,
but its two main facades...

38
00:04:57,498 --> 00:05:00,729
<i>The land we have chosen
for MEDI 1 SAT</i>

39
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:05,032
<i>Is located In the northwest area
of the Tanglers' Free Zone,</i>

40
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:06,664
<i>bordering the airport.</i>

41
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:10,334
<i>It has a surface
of 192,800 square feet,</i>

42
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:13,880
<i>which gives us enough space
for our main building.</i>

43
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:16,040
<i>Construction and equipment
techniques chosen</i>

44
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,742
<i>to build MEDH SAT were designed</i>

45
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,876
<i>to Insure the durability
of the Investment.</i>

46
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:23,480
<i>Walls and curtains built with
lacquered aluminum structures,</i>

47
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,558
<i>mounted with double-glazing
dimmed windows,</i>

48
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:29,323
<i>full walls or covered with plastic
coated sheet metal cladding.</i>

49
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:33,798
<i>In the western wing of the building,
an 820-square-feet set</i>

50
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:37,531
<i>is dedicated to live news broadcast.</i>

51
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:40,198
<i>It communicates with a control room,</i>

52
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:45,404
<i>processing sound, Image, light,
and external broadcasting.</i>

53
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:56,989
<i>Céclle, I don't want to show my face.</i>

54
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,060
<i>Or at least not yet.
I am afraid you won't recognize me.</i>

55
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,685
It would be nice
if you closed your eyes.

56
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,263
That way you would only
hear my voice.

57
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,923
Every night, I hear yours
on the radio, I look at the city,

58
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,559
and to me,
you and the city become one.

59
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:11,104
Now, the moment has come to--

60
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:14,038
Shit. That's bad.

61
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,919
You cut your hair?
Good idea. You look better that way.

62
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,000
<i>With or without curls
My style is right</i>

63
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,900
You know, I didn't come alone.
I came with Nadia.

64
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:45,836
You could have told me.

65
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,237
I thought you would be happy
to know her. It's been so long.

66
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:50,208
Well, sure, but not like this.
You're impossible.

67
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,074
You put people
in front of the situation,

68
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:53,840
and you let them deal with it.

69
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:55,881
Anyway. It's all right.
Where is she?

70
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:57,747
She's afraid to come out.
Come on.

71
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,119
Hello, Nadia. It's very nice meeting
you. Better late than never.

72
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,289
Hello, Rachid. How old are you?

73
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,265
Nine and a half years old.

74
00:07:14,368 --> 00:07:16,336
My name isn't Rachid, right, mom?

75
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,995
<i>His name is Saïd.</i>

76
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,970
I didn't know you were coming,
but let's celebrate.

77
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:25,136
Nadia came to see her sister.
Are you sure she's coming?

78
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:27,543
Of course she is. I'll wait for her.

79
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:30,083
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

80
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:36,879
I feel bad leaving you here.

81
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,049
I'm fine. Go ahead. Seriously.

82
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,560
We'll go have an orange juice.

83
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:56,475
I'm sure her sister won't come.
Do you mind if she stays with us?

84
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:58,944
Honestly, Semi, I would have preferred
if it didn't happen this way.

85
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:00,343
It's very simple. Just say yes or no.

86
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,108
I am the one who has to make
the decision?

87
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:03,877
Well, ask your father.

88
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,180
It won't be a problem, then.
He has always respected my freedom.

89
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,618
Right, and to you, freedom means
imposing your whims on others.

90
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,156
Don't start, please.

91
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:14,960
We'll end up doing what you want
anyway, as always.

92
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:18,023
I'll go get her, then.

93
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,642
Don't stay here. It's ridiculous.

94
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:32,371
Something must have come up.
It happens.

95
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,675
I have her cell phone number.
She'll answer the phone at some point.

96
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:37,842
Stop it, Nadia. You've been
leaving messages for a week.

97
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:39,510
If she wanted to talk to you,
she would have done it already.

98
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,987
Don't say that.
I know her better than you do.

99
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:43,352
Fine.

100
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,718
Meanwhile, come
to my parents' house. It'll be easier.

101
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:51,298
No way!
I've already told you that.

102
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:54,094
At least for tonight.
We'll figure it out tomorrow.

103
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,409
Where's the lady?

104
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,954
She's waiting for us in the car.

105
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,420
Is she your mommy?

106
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:17,888
Yes, she is.

107
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,789
Why did she call me Rachid?

108
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,884
She made a mistake.

109
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,660
What's her name?

110
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:27,024
Cécile.

111
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:45,817
It was a floating island, surrounded
by an indestructible bronze wall,

112
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,752
with a smooth rock pointed at the top.

113
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:50,287
Twelve children were in the palace.

114
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:54,088
They were born in Eole. Six boys
and six girls in their blooming youth.

115
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,219
What does "blooming" mean?

116
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:00,892
It means they were
opening like flowers.

117
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:01,934
Like you.

118
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,998
I am not an opening flower.

119
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,300
I'll continue reading.

120
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:09,569
On the island, Ernie's daughters
had married his sons.

121
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:10,700
The most diverse meals--

122
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,438
Why aren't you coming?
Are you hiding?

123
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:17,609
I am not hiding.
I didn't want to interrupt.

124
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:20,688
It's 8:00 pm, anyway.
I have to run to the station.

125
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:23,849
I left the window open.
The eastern wind has calmed down.

126
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,083
But if you would rather close it...

127
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:25,681
No, it's okay.

128
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,556
Above all, make yourself at home.
You promise?

129
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:28,685
Yes, madam.

130
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:31,231
Madam? Don't call me madam!

131
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:33,390
Come on, Nadia.
Don't be anxious like this.

132
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,332
I am very happy to have you here.

133
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,301
Good night, Saïd.

134
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:43,506
Well, I am going out for a bit.
Can you give me a ride to town?

135
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,702
If you want to.

136
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,677
Sea? I told you things
would go well with my mother.

137
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:50,478
She's overdoing it.
It makes me uncomfortable.

138
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:53,880
She's always distant, so she's making
an effort to be affectionate.

139
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,421
It comes off as clumsy.

140
00:10:57,891 --> 00:10:59,950
Did you see? Your parents
put us in the same room.

141
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,222
So? We've slept together before,
right?

142
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:03,928
Okay, I'm taking off.

143
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:05,294
Already?

144
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,595
You didn't even unpack.

145
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:09,100
You want me to stay with you?

146
00:11:09,203 --> 00:11:11,535
No, it's okay.

147
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:14,801
I feel a little uncomfortable to be
alone in this house with your father.

148
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:17,570
Don't worry. He doesn't talk much.
You don't even have to greet him.

149
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,011
- What is this?
- My toys.

150
00:11:25,586 --> 00:11:28,055
We could give them to Saïd.
What do you think?

151
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:35,426
You don't want to dive in?

152
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,156
No, thank you.

153
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,368
Actually, I'll just walk.

154
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:51,467
Come on. Stay a little longer!

155
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,774
You're always running away.
Shouldn't we try to talk a little?

156
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:54,575
Talk about what?

157
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:56,740
I don't know.
Talk about you, your life.

158
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,512
It's only normal.
You call once in a blue moon.

159
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,179
You're exaggerating.
I always tell you what's going on.

160
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:04,588
I'm not mad at you, Sami.
I just want to understand.

161
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:05,624
There's nothing to understand.

162
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,888
What about Nadia? Sa'ï'd?
This is news to me.

163
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:12,022
I told you we lived together in Paris.
It's not a surprise, is it?

164
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:15,859
What time is your show?

165
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:17,368
In 10 minutes.
I'll never get there on time.

166
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:19,200
Just walk. I'll take the car.

167
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:23,906
I'll leave it on the parking lot.

168
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:26,503
No, keep it.
I'll take a taxi to go home.

169
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:37,457
You didn't tell me how long you were
staying, you and your friends.

170
00:12:37,558 --> 00:12:38,616
Is ten days all right?

171
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:39,886
Last time, you didn't last a week.

172
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:41,722
May I remind you
that you were never around?

173
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:44,389
You want people to be here,
and you're always somewhere else.

174
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:46,861
I hate you!

175
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:40,678
Wait a second!

176
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:15,080
Nadia?

177
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:16,418
A'l'c h a ?

178
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,048
Hold on.

179
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:23,156
I left a ton of messages.
You could have called me back.

180
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:25,061
Calling cell phones is expensive.

181
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:27,566
I can't afford it,
especially foreign cell phones.

182
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:29,534
So, are you here?

183
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:31,968
Yes, Sami took me
to his parents' house.

184
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:33,403
But I would much rather
stay at your place, because--

185
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:35,874
You can't stay at my place.
It's too small.

186
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:37,808
<i>Hold on.</i>

187
00:14:46,787 --> 00:14:49,654
Nadia? Nadia?

188
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:00,428
What's going on? Are you ill?

189
00:15:00,534 --> 00:15:02,127
<i>No, I'm fine.</i>

190
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:03,965
So what's new with you?

191
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,800
<i>Not much.</i>

192
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:08,136
I need to pay for mom's
hospital treatment,

193
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:09,641
so I work overtime at McDonald's.

194
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,233
I sleep. I work a lot.

195
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:15,711
What about you?
Did you bring your son?

196
00:15:15,816 --> 00:15:19,116
Of course.
I can't wait for you to see him.

197
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:22,518
Please be discreet.
Don't come by my work.

198
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,284
They don't know I have a twin sister.

199
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:26,723
Besides, I don't want them to ask
questions about you or your life.

200
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:29,762
You know how people are over here.
This is not Paris.

201
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:32,628
Don't worry. What time do you get off?

202
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:34,997
<i>It depends. Never before midnight.</i>

203
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,400
That's late for a child.

204
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:46,512
Listen, I think we should do this
some other time.

205
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,708
What do you mean,
"some other time"?

206
00:15:49,817 --> 00:15:52,445
I haven't seen you for six years,
and that's all you can say?

207
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:55,146
Listen, I just got off work.
I only get five hours of sleep.

208
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:56,848
I'm completely exhausted.

209
00:15:56,957 --> 00:16:00,086
I understand that you're tired,
but still...

210
00:16:04,665 --> 00:16:05,564
Listen, A'l'cha.

211
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,966
If you don't want to see me ever
again, please be honest about it.

212
00:16:09,103 --> 00:16:10,867
Well, okay, then. I'll be honest.

213
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,030
I don't feel so well, and I don't
have the strength to see you.

214
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,336
I am afraid it will hurt me.

215
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:18,976
I need to learn
how to live without you.

216
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:22,978
When I succeed,
I promise we'll see each other.

217
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:29,282
I'm sorry, Nadia. I love you
very much. I'll call you back.

218
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:12,295
You have oversized the structures.

219
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:14,800
We had to,
because of earthquake hazard.

220
00:17:14,902 --> 00:17:17,564
- What level?
- Level three.

221
00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:18,832
What's that?

222
00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:22,271
Is this how far you got
with the drilling?

223
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:23,866
- Yes.
- Get going then.

224
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:25,274
We've already lost two weeks.

225
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:26,710
All right.

226
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,614
Look, here.

227
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:33,680
I trust you to get things moving.

228
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:35,687
Give me the number.

229
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:41,353
Okay. Let's check the measurement.

230
00:17:41,462 --> 00:17:42,520
That's no good.

231
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:44,290
Follow me, my friend.

232
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:07,779
<i>To my wife and all my friends
In Algiers.</i>

233
00:18:07,888 --> 00:18:09,413
<i>To my fiancé, Youssef,</i>

234
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:12,390
<i>who went to work for an Insurance
company In Casablanca.</i>

235
00:18:12,493 --> 00:18:15,428
<i>Dedicating this song to my love.</i>

236
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:18,692
<i>I want to dedicate this song to all
my friends who will recognize me.</i>

237
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,461
<i>Walld, Karim, Omar,
as well as my whole family.</i>

238
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:23,696
<i>Even If I don't see them often
because we're far away,</i>

239
00:18:23,804 --> 00:18:25,169
<i>I hold them close to my heart.</i>

240
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:31,939
<i>Walld, Karim, Omar,
as well as my whole family.</i>

241
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:36,175
<i>To all Reggae fans and
to the Tanglers soccer team.</i>

242
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:39,878
<i>To all Reggae fans and
to the Tanglers soccer team.</i>

243
00:18:39,987 --> 00:18:41,148
After listening to this song,

244
00:18:41,255 --> 00:18:45,021
we will listen to the news
with Patrice Martin.

245
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:48,459
After this song,
we'll give you the news.

246
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:53,498
<i>It's better to think of nothing
Than not to think at all</i>

247
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,591
<i>Nothing is already something</i>

248
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:58,728
<i>It's already a lot</i>

249
00:18:59,106 --> 00:19:04,169
<i>We don't remember a thing
And since we forget It all</i>

250
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:07,103
<i>Nothing Is better</i>

251
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:10,479
<i>Nothing is better than anything else</i>

252
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:13,746
I say 'he,' but maybe it's a woman?

253
00:19:13,854 --> 00:19:16,755
I don't know.
Give them to someone, sell them.

254
00:19:16,857 --> 00:19:20,122
But, please, dear,
stop talking about it.

255
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:22,719
If I were you,
I would die to know who it is.

256
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,924
Are you sure you don't want me
to ask the flower shop?

257
00:19:25,032 --> 00:19:26,796
Are you crazy?

258
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,359
Anonymous gifts are like
anonymous letters. It's blackmail.

259
00:19:31,205 --> 00:19:32,400
Give them to me.

260
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:37,136
It's too bad.

261
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:39,008
How is Sami?

262
00:19:39,113 --> 00:19:40,740
It's hard to know with him.

263
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:45,149
Resolution 1546 was voted earlier
at the UN headquarters in New York.

264
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:49,211
Iraq is scheduled to recover
its sovereignty on June 30th.

265
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:06,596
Where are the dogs?

266
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:08,368
It's lunchtime for them.

267
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:10,807
So you finally made up your mind?

268
00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:12,310
Hi, Bilal.

269
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,913
- Don't just stand there. Come in.
- Am I interrupting?

270
00:20:16,016 --> 00:20:16,676
What are you talking about?

271
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:17,649
You woke me up
in the middle of the night.

272
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:21,016
I was afraid. I didn't know if you
were allowed to have friends over.

273
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:23,886
My bosses don't live here.
I see them once a year in July.

274
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:25,481
I didn't know if you wanted to see me.

275
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:26,718
I told you to come in. Are you deaf?

276
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:34,564
The garden looks beautiful.
Can you take me on a tour?

277
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:35,829
Is that why you're here?

278
00:20:35,936 --> 00:20:37,370
No. I came for you.

279
00:20:44,144 --> 00:20:45,805
Why aren't you looking at me?

280
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:49,343
Well, there. I am looking at you.

281
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,440
You want one?

282
00:20:50,551 --> 00:20:52,576
No, I quit smoking, drinking,
and going out.

283
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:53,710
I quit everything.

284
00:20:53,821 --> 00:20:54,982
Even sex?

285
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,017
That's the only thing
you have in mind.

286
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,889
I don't care. I could do without.

287
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:00,858
I don't believe that.

288
00:21:00,961 --> 00:21:05,398
See? I don't need anything.
I live like a king here.

289
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:06,762
I make 2,000 dinars a month.

290
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:10,303
A garden, a swimming pool,
a view of the sea.

291
00:21:10,404 --> 00:21:12,634
That's true. I couldn't give you
all that in Paris.

292
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:14,104
Don't start again with Paris.

293
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,973
It's nice to visit,
but I wouldn't stay there.

294
00:21:17,077 --> 00:21:19,375
I've always told you.
I don't want to depend on you.

295
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,278
Sorry for talking about Paris.

296
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:23,406
Always apologizing.
Like all Europeans.

297
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:25,849
The 'love of my life' trick,
is that European, too?

298
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:27,284
I don't know
what you're talking about.

299
00:21:27,388 --> 00:21:28,913
You know how it goes.

300
00:21:29,022 --> 00:21:31,514
They pick a guy, they take
him home in their luggage,

301
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:32,956
and if there's a problem,
they send him back to his village.

302
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,721
I would never do anything
like that to you, Bilal.

303
00:21:34,828 --> 00:21:36,057
You're too suspicious.

304
00:21:36,163 --> 00:21:38,029
You need to learn how to trust people.

305
00:21:38,132 --> 00:21:41,466
Trust? That's right.
You're not honest, Sami.

306
00:21:41,568 --> 00:21:42,967
What about that poor Nadia?

307
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,129
I don't understand
what you're doing together.

308
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:46,263
I need her.

309
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:48,808
Of course, you don't know anything
about connections between people.

310
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:50,343
You despise everyone.

311
00:21:50,444 --> 00:21:51,878
You're wrong, Sami.

312
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:54,573
I am not looking for love.
I just want respect.

313
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:56,171
You don't know what you want.

314
00:21:56,283 --> 00:21:57,682
You don't make decisions.

315
00:21:58,452 --> 00:22:00,216
It's understandable, though.

316
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,484
Half Moroccan, half French.
Half man, half woman.

317
00:22:04,591 --> 00:22:07,026
It must be hard for you
to figure it out.

318
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,865
Where are you going?

319
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:16,061
It's time for me to go
take care of the garden.

320
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:26,571
How's everyone?

321
00:22:50,471 --> 00:22:51,961
Well, I'll let you work, then.

322
00:22:52,072 --> 00:22:54,598
No, wait.
I want to show you something.

323
00:22:55,642 --> 00:22:57,406
Look at this.

324
00:22:57,511 --> 00:23:00,208
40,000 dinars.
I got a two-year financing plan.

325
00:23:00,981 --> 00:23:02,949
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Yeah.

326
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:15,025
What are you waiting for?
That's why you came, isn't it?

327
00:23:15,129 --> 00:23:17,826
I thought you didn't want
to have sex anymore.

328
00:23:17,931 --> 00:23:22,232
I don't miss it,
but if I have the opportunity...

329
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:25,705
Come on, take your clothes off.

330
00:23:29,276 --> 00:23:30,869
Is this all you have?

331
00:23:30,978 --> 00:23:32,946
Is it for a ring or a necklace?

332
00:23:33,046 --> 00:23:34,536
I don't know yet.

333
00:23:34,648 --> 00:23:38,710
I am hereto help you. But it is
difficult without knowing the person.

334
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:40,309
Wait. I have a photo.

335
00:23:40,421 --> 00:23:46,224
It's an old one,
but she's about my age now.

336
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:48,823
Too bad it's a black and white photo.

337
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:50,795
The colour of her eyes
is very important.

338
00:23:50,898 --> 00:23:53,060
She has green eyes.

339
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:00,637
I need to think about it
a little bit more.

340
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:02,334
Thank you very much, sir.

341
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:22,888
Why didn't Sa'l'd come with us?

342
00:24:22,996 --> 00:24:25,795
He prefers watching television.

343
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:29,762
Watch out with the bottles.
Double the bags.

344
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,338
Do you need help?

345
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:35,332
You know children don't like shopping.

346
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:29,057
Don't move. Don't strain yourself.
I am a doctor. Let me see this.

347
00:25:35,102 --> 00:25:37,901
It doesn't seem broken.
It's only the cartilage.

348
00:25:38,105 --> 00:25:39,766
You need to get some X-rays.

349
00:25:40,307 --> 00:25:42,901
Breathe slowly. With your mouth.

350
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,307
How do you feel?

351
00:25:44,411 --> 00:25:45,879
My stomach hurts.

352
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:47,378
Does your head hurt?

353
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:50,880
I'm telling you, my stomach hurts.
I am...

354
00:25:50,984 --> 00:25:52,383
You're what?

355
00:25:54,154 --> 00:25:57,351
I'm emptying my bowels.
I have the runs.

356
00:25:57,457 --> 00:25:59,084
Stay back!

357
00:26:01,662 --> 00:26:04,290
Don't lower your head.
Keep your head back.

358
00:26:43,303 --> 00:26:45,294
Where's my saviour?

359
00:26:45,405 --> 00:26:47,635
Your savior's name is Nathan.
He's my husband.

360
00:26:47,741 --> 00:26:50,802
He had to go.
You're not his only patient.

361
00:26:50,911 --> 00:26:53,243
He really wants you to get an X-ray.

362
00:26:53,347 --> 00:26:56,510
It's nothing. I'll have a bump
on my nose tomorrow.

363
00:26:56,617 --> 00:26:57,584
Still pretending to be a brute?

364
00:26:57,684 --> 00:27:01,518
Yes. I am a constant guy.
That's my nature.

365
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:07,393
What are you doing in Tangiers?

366
00:27:07,494 --> 00:27:11,055
I am overseeing the construction of a
broadcasting centre in the Free Zone.

367
00:27:11,165 --> 00:27:13,862
Yes, I've heard of it.
It's an ambitious project.

368
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:15,332
It's very involved, politically.

369
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:18,404
You know, I only handle
the construction part.

370
00:27:18,505 --> 00:27:21,202
I need to give them the building
in six months.

371
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:23,538
I don't care about the rest.

372
00:27:23,644 --> 00:27:25,339
It's a TV channel
that will serve all of North Africa,

373
00:27:25,445 --> 00:27:26,674
as a rival to Aljazeera.

374
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,715
It will promote moderate Islam.

375
00:27:30,684 --> 00:27:34,416
Sir, may I remind you that you have an
appointment at the consulting office?

376
00:27:34,521 --> 00:27:36,956
And I'll remind you that
the appointment is in an hour.

377
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:38,024
Yes, but you wanted to talk

378
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:40,025
about the contractors' estimates
before the meeting.

379
00:27:40,127 --> 00:27:42,562
Very well. I'll be right there.

380
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:45,856
Why are you laughing?

381
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,595
When I first met you, you were skinny
and you were always talking

382
00:27:49,703 --> 00:27:52,400
about how you were broke
and proud of it.

383
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:54,497
SQ)?

384
00:27:55,876 --> 00:28:00,177
So, it looks like you've made it,
as they say.

385
00:28:01,982 --> 00:28:03,814
Your family didn't come with you?

386
00:28:03,951 --> 00:28:11,119
No, I'm single.
I'm the same as when we met.

387
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,126
You never got married?

388
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:17,122
No. Why?

389
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:20,834
Oh, nothing.

390
00:28:20,934 --> 00:28:22,299
Well, Antoine, I have to go,

391
00:28:22,403 --> 00:28:25,805
because I do have a family,
and I need to take care of them.

392
00:28:34,081 --> 00:28:35,549
I can give you a ride.

393
00:28:35,649 --> 00:28:38,277
That's very sweet, but
I don't need it. I have Nathan's car.

394
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:39,716
But we're going to see each other
again, right?

395
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,187
Of course, if you're here for six
months, there will be other occasions.

396
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:44,087
Tell me when. It will be easier.

397
00:28:44,191 --> 00:28:45,556
I would love to have you over
for dinner,

398
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:48,094
but I work every night after 8:00 pm,
so it's not very practical.

399
00:28:48,195 --> 00:28:49,822
I know. I listen to you every night.

400
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:50,761
I used to be the news host.

401
00:28:50,864 --> 00:28:53,026
That was more appropriate for me,
but I need to make a living, so--

402
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:54,362
So, when do we see each other?

403
00:28:54,468 --> 00:28:55,993
Listen, Antoine, I'll let you know.

404
00:28:56,103 --> 00:28:59,300
I know which hotel you're staying at.
I promise I'll call you.

405
00:29:21,161 --> 00:29:22,560
What should I plan for Sunday?

406
00:29:22,663 --> 00:29:24,791
The company has agreements
with the Yachting club.

407
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:26,127
Would you like to go on a boat ride?

408
00:29:26,233 --> 00:29:29,396
No. I'd rather stay in the hotel.

409
00:29:29,503 --> 00:29:32,302
If you refuse all entertainment,
you'll end up being depressed.

410
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:33,497
There are many things to see.

411
00:29:33,607 --> 00:29:35,837
The Phoenician tombs,
the Caves of Hercules, Cape Spartel.

412
00:29:35,943 --> 00:29:38,173
Don't bother, Nabila.
I am not interested.

413
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:39,268
What are you interested in, then?

414
00:29:39,379 --> 00:29:43,475
I am paid to organize your leisure
time. I don't know what to do anymore.

415
00:29:43,584 --> 00:29:47,316
You really want
to do something for me?

416
00:29:47,421 --> 00:29:49,082
Tell me about witchcraft.

417
00:29:50,991 --> 00:29:51,753
Witchcraft?

418
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:54,351
Well, yes. It is still practiced
in your country, isn't it?

419
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:57,158
Parallel activities are not included
in my job description.

420
00:29:57,264 --> 00:29:58,390
I would be too scared to get fired.

421
00:29:58,499 --> 00:30:01,059
Nobody will know about it.
It will be our secret.

422
00:30:01,168 --> 00:30:03,694
Of course, your price will be mine.

423
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:08,298
It's not only a question of money.
It's a question of belief, knowledge.

424
00:30:08,408 --> 00:30:11,469
Well, precisely. Teach me, Nabila.

425
00:30:11,578 --> 00:30:13,478
I only know the most common rituals.

426
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,674
Put a spell on someone
or break that spell.

427
00:30:15,783 --> 00:30:18,878
That's exactly what I need.

428
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:21,978
I would like someone
to fall in love with me.

429
00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:47,575
In the name of God...

430
00:30:52,219 --> 00:30:56,952
God is great!

431
00:30:57,057 --> 00:31:01,460
God is great!

432
00:31:01,562 --> 00:31:06,193
God is great!

433
00:31:42,136 --> 00:31:44,161
What are you doing here, Nabila?

434
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:47,605
This is a documentary
about the Gnawa Brotherhood.

435
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:51,008
There are other brotherhoods.
The lssawa, the Hmadcha.

436
00:31:51,111 --> 00:31:53,011
In this one, you'll see a Lila.

437
00:31:53,113 --> 00:31:56,708
It's a therapy that exorcises
the demons within us.

438
00:31:56,817 --> 00:31:59,912
I don't need therapy. I am not sick.

439
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:04,890
It could set you free
from that person.

440
00:32:04,992 --> 00:32:09,259
I don't need to be set free.
I want to cast a spell on her.

441
00:32:09,363 --> 00:32:12,560
Most spells are evil acts.

442
00:32:12,666 --> 00:32:16,728
Let's be clear. I mean no harm.

443
00:32:16,837 --> 00:32:20,000
You can't possess someone
without hurting him or her.

444
00:32:23,844 --> 00:32:30,807
Fine. Well, I thank you, then.

445
00:32:43,263 --> 00:32:46,528
Listen, Nathan.
You should really talk to Sami.

446
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:48,567
Did you see that poor Nadia?
She's completely lost.

447
00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:50,763
I don't know how you can be
so unperturbed.

448
00:32:50,871 --> 00:32:52,896
You didn't have to invite them.

449
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,840
You're impossible!
What did you want me to do?

450
00:32:56,944 --> 00:32:57,740
What would you have done?

451
00:32:57,845 --> 00:32:58,812
I would have welcomed them.

452
00:32:58,912 --> 00:33:01,176
I would have accepted them
the way they are.

453
00:33:03,317 --> 00:33:05,376
That's called controlling yourself.

454
00:33:05,486 --> 00:33:08,046
Nonsense. I call that cowardice.

455
00:33:08,689 --> 00:33:12,785
You're always over-dramatizing.
It's just a matter of behaviour.

456
00:33:13,861 --> 00:33:16,922
You should reflect on that.
It would give everyone a vacation.

457
00:33:17,397 --> 00:33:19,832
The law of silence. As always.

458
00:33:27,641 --> 00:33:28,904
You're not working today?

459
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:31,273
I am. At 11:00 am.

460
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:35,247
You start working later every day.

461
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:38,311
It's not my fault. Clients
don't come rushing at the door.

462
00:33:46,994 --> 00:33:49,053
You have no excuse today.
Did you see the weather?

463
00:33:49,163 --> 00:33:52,394
You have to make an effort to go out.
It will do you good.

464
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,900
I don't feel like going out.

465
00:33:58,772 --> 00:34:01,901
What's wrong, Nadia?
You don't want to tell me?

466
00:34:02,009 --> 00:34:03,568
It's nothing, madam.

467
00:34:04,178 --> 00:34:07,204
It's just a little down phase,
as Sami would say.

468
00:34:08,315 --> 00:34:12,616
He's something else. Never around.
Always out and about.

469
00:34:14,221 --> 00:34:15,086
It's only normal.

470
00:34:15,189 --> 00:34:18,591
He hasn't been here for a long time,
so he's enjoying himself.

471
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:22,559
I hope he takes care of you
a bit more than this in Paris.

472
00:34:22,663 --> 00:34:25,189
I don't need anyone
to take care of me.

473
00:34:28,035 --> 00:34:30,333
Do you like it there?
Do you have friends?

474
00:34:31,638 --> 00:34:35,074
Look, don't worry about me.
It's not a problem.

475
00:34:35,175 --> 00:34:37,269
I am used to being alone.

476
00:34:38,412 --> 00:34:40,779
Besides, I have Sa'l'd.
You know how children are.

477
00:34:41,882 --> 00:34:44,180
You don't have time
to get bored with them.

478
00:34:52,292 --> 00:34:54,989
Stretch your arms
and push with your legs.

479
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:59,692
There. Push with your legs.
Come on! Come on!

480
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,564
Like that? Is that okay?

481
00:35:17,251 --> 00:35:18,514
Are you cold?

482
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:19,381
No, I'm fine.

483
00:35:19,486 --> 00:35:20,783
So, how was it?

484
00:35:20,888 --> 00:35:21,582
It was awesome.

485
00:35:21,689 --> 00:35:23,487
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Can I watch television?

486
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:26,082
Yes, but take a shower first.

487
00:36:01,128 --> 00:36:02,994
Quiet!

488
00:36:28,522 --> 00:36:31,548
<i>Sam has agreed to do something
for Norreddlne,</i>

489
00:36:31,659 --> 00:36:35,789
<i>In</i> order <i>to help him with the Issues
tearing his soul' apart.</i>

490
00:36:35,896 --> 00:36:37,728
<i>Everything is blessed with incense.</i>

491
00:36:37,831 --> 00:36:39,560
<i>Norreddlne Is wrapped
In various cloths</i>

492
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:41,726
<i>bearing the colours of the Gnawa.</i>

493
00:36:41,835 --> 00:36:46,329
<i>Each colour stands for one
of the spirits living in our world.</i>

494
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,274
<i>Sam tries every colour, because
he doesn't know yet which spirit</i>

495
00:36:50,377 --> 00:36:54,541
<i>has entered Nerreddlne's soul,
disrupting his existence.</i>

496
00:36:55,649 --> 00:36:59,813
<i>He has also chosen a multicolored
rooster for the same reason.</i>

497
00:37:12,066 --> 00:37:14,160
<i>Sam calls the various spirits,</i>

498
00:37:14,268 --> 00:37:17,238
<i>inviting them to move away
from Norreddine.</i>

499
00:37:19,807 --> 00:37:22,799
<i>At one point, he threatens them
with his knife.</i>

500
00:37:55,376 --> 00:37:59,540
<i>Two terrorist attacks and four
hostages were liberated In Iraq today.</i>

501
00:37:59,647 --> 00:38:02,878
<i>We'll start with information
given by</i> a <i>Polish general</i>

502
00:38:02,983 --> 00:38:05,543
<i>to the judicial authorities
in his country.</i>

503
00:38:05,652 --> 00:38:09,611
<i>Four hostages were liberated by
elite units of the Coalition forces.</i>

504
00:38:09,723 --> 00:38:11,885
<i>Soldiers were buried last Saturday</i>

505
00:38:11,992 --> 00:38:14,586
<i>with one of their compatriots,
Pietro Fetrucci.</i>

506
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,992
I don't mean to be a party pooper,
but we do need to work.

507
00:38:40,087 --> 00:38:41,179
Jerk!

508
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:55,730
"To people who listen to Baid escata."

509
00:38:55,836 --> 00:38:59,795
"To students at the National
Business School in Agadir."

510
00:38:59,907 --> 00:39:02,103
"To Rose, my dear wife,
mother of the beautiful Ines."

511
00:39:02,209 --> 00:39:04,837
Hey, you're lucky to have
your little tribe around.

512
00:39:04,945 --> 00:39:06,174
That's true. I'm lucky.

513
00:39:26,834 --> 00:39:30,134
I didn't hear from you,
and it's Sunday, so I thought...

514
00:39:30,237 --> 00:39:32,399
I'm sorry, Antoine.
I completely forgot about you.

515
00:39:32,506 --> 00:39:34,873
I'm sort of busy these days.

516
00:39:34,975 --> 00:39:36,636
How is your nose?

517
00:39:36,744 --> 00:39:39,213
Look, it changes colours.

518
00:39:39,313 --> 00:39:42,112
You're exaggerating. It's almost gone.

519
00:39:42,216 --> 00:39:44,480
Would you have a glass of water?
It's so hot. I'm really thirsty.

520
00:39:44,585 --> 00:39:47,520
Sure, come in.

521
00:39:48,222 --> 00:39:51,453
I'm warning you, the house is really
messy. We sort of live like nomads.

522
00:39:51,558 --> 00:39:54,653
This is Rachel Meyer,
my work partner.

523
00:39:54,762 --> 00:39:56,958
Antoine Lavau, an old friend.

524
00:39:57,064 --> 00:39:59,431
An old friend?
I don't really like that.

525
00:39:59,533 --> 00:40:02,867
Antoine was my first love.
Is that better?

526
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:06,736
It seems more accurate.
It's nice to meet you.

527
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,934
You said you wanted a glass of water?

528
00:40:09,043 --> 00:40:12,741
Yes, a glass of water with
a little scotch, if you have some.

529
00:40:16,216 --> 00:40:19,743
I told Cécile how much
I liked your show.

530
00:40:19,853 --> 00:40:22,379
All those people sending signals
to each other in the night.

531
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:24,355
It makes my imagination wander.

532
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:27,651
It's always the same messages.
It's a little monotonous.

533
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:32,665
Not for me. People's love life
is the only thing I am interested in.

534
00:40:32,766 --> 00:40:35,792
It's so refreshing to meet a man
who isn't afraid of feelings.

535
00:40:35,903 --> 00:40:38,099
Right, Cécile?

536
00:40:38,205 --> 00:40:42,699
Tell me, do you think the first love
can become the last love?

537
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:47,240
Don't pay attention to him.
He's crazy.

538
00:40:47,348 --> 00:40:50,909
Here, take this. You need it.

539
00:40:51,785 --> 00:40:54,413
So, how's the cripple doing?

540
00:40:54,521 --> 00:40:57,650
I apologize for showing up at your
house like this, unannounced.

541
00:40:57,758 --> 00:41:00,159
You're welcome here.
My wife's friends are friends of mine.

542
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,957
- Thank you.
- Don't stand like this. Come here.

543
00:41:04,765 --> 00:41:06,199
Can you serve me a drink, too?

544
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,565
Do it yourself, honey. I need
to work on the show with Rachel.

545
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:14,939
I married a feminist.
She doesn't let anything slide.

546
00:41:15,042 --> 00:41:17,067
So how is my head?

547
00:41:24,018 --> 00:41:26,248
Everything's normal.

548
00:41:26,854 --> 00:41:28,151
Let me see.

549
00:41:28,856 --> 00:41:31,416
Tell me, Nathan, do you receive
patients in your bathing suit, now?

550
00:41:31,525 --> 00:41:34,722
Please go ahead, doctor.
It doesn't bother me.

551
00:41:34,828 --> 00:41:38,093
I have to say, I like to spend
my Sundays naked.

552
00:41:38,198 --> 00:41:40,758
Your friend is less of a conformist
than you are.

553
00:41:40,868 --> 00:41:42,632
What kind of lotion are you using?

554
00:41:42,736 --> 00:41:47,435
'Morning Care' by Clarins.
The pharmacist recommended it.

555
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:50,704
That's just cosmetics.
It doesn't heal the bruise.

556
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:55,910
So? Not too disoriented in Tangiers?

557
00:41:56,016 --> 00:41:57,780
Oh, you know, I travel a lot.

558
00:41:57,885 --> 00:42:01,014
I've worked on construction sites
in Mali, Turkey, in the Philippines.

559
00:42:01,121 --> 00:42:04,580
I even lived in Chile for two years.

560
00:42:05,492 --> 00:42:08,154
Well, if you're staying for a while,
it's silly to stay in a hotel.

561
00:42:08,262 --> 00:42:10,162
There are plenty of houses
to rent around here.

562
00:42:10,264 --> 00:42:11,754
Cécile didn't tell you about it?

563
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:14,493
It would be nice, but I don't
want to abuse your generosity.

564
00:42:14,601 --> 00:42:17,468
I'm sure she could help you.
Right, Cécile?

565
00:42:17,571 --> 00:42:20,268
Thank you. You're embarrassing me.

566
00:42:22,743 --> 00:42:24,905
What do you do in the evening?

567
00:42:25,746 --> 00:42:28,545
Absolutely nothing.

568
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:32,285
May I use the restroom?

569
00:42:34,455 --> 00:42:36,651
They're at the end of the hall.

570
00:42:38,092 --> 00:42:40,754
Pardon me.

571
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:44,798
Your friend looks a little lost.

572
00:42:46,133 --> 00:42:47,897
Should we have him stay for dinner?

573
00:42:48,001 --> 00:42:50,527
Don't you think
there are enough of us already?

574
00:42:51,338 --> 00:42:52,806
Listen, Cécile.
Is he your friend or not?

575
00:42:52,906 --> 00:42:53,668
Of course he is.

576
00:42:53,774 --> 00:42:55,674
But we don't have that much food,
and we're not done yet.

577
00:42:55,776 --> 00:42:57,175
We have to be
at the station in an hour.

578
00:42:57,277 --> 00:42:58,438
As you wish.

579
00:42:58,545 --> 00:43:00,570
Would you mind
putting some clothes on, Nathan?

580
00:43:00,681 --> 00:43:02,240
I'll jump in one last time.

581
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:06,150
"To students at the National
Business School in Agadir."

582
00:43:06,253 --> 00:43:07,414
I like the one from Montreal.

583
00:43:07,521 --> 00:43:11,788
I want to dedicate this song
to Moroccans living in Montreal.

584
00:43:11,892 --> 00:43:14,361
'My brother, my sister...'

585
00:43:14,461 --> 00:43:16,589
I don't understand this one,
but if you do...

586
00:43:16,697 --> 00:43:18,859
'I miss the family a whole lot.'

587
00:43:18,966 --> 00:43:22,869
'To my neighbours and friends
in the community.'

588
00:43:33,981 --> 00:43:35,710
Come swim with me, Sa'l'd.

589
00:43:35,816 --> 00:43:36,942
No, I don't want to go.

590
00:43:37,051 --> 00:43:41,488
You're scared! I know it.
You're scared!

591
00:43:41,622 --> 00:43:42,783
Come on.

592
00:43:44,191 --> 00:43:46,853
That's it. Let go.

593
00:43:48,262 --> 00:43:50,526
There you go.

594
00:43:51,865 --> 00:43:53,390
You like it?

595
00:44:14,922 --> 00:44:16,856
How far are we?

596
00:44:16,957 --> 00:44:19,119
Two or three miles.

597
00:44:19,226 --> 00:44:22,389
It's beautiful. You'll see.
It's worth the effort.

598
00:44:24,198 --> 00:44:27,293
If you like it so much,
why don't you rent it yourself?

599
00:44:27,401 --> 00:44:30,166
I can't afford it.

600
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:31,829
The windshield is filthy.

601
00:44:31,939 --> 00:44:33,805
It really doesn't matter.

602
00:44:34,875 --> 00:44:37,139
By the way, how old is your husband?

603
00:44:37,711 --> 00:44:39,076
He's younger than me.

604
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:41,739
- Why are you asking?
- No particular reason.

605
00:44:44,718 --> 00:44:47,210
How is the retirement situation here?

606
00:44:48,422 --> 00:44:50,186
What kind of question is that?

607
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:53,693
You want to know if we make
a good living? Not really, Antoine.

608
00:44:55,062 --> 00:44:57,554
Well, with your job at the radio--

609
00:44:57,665 --> 00:44:59,394
You know, my job at the radio...

610
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,798
They give priority to Moroccans,
which is understandable.

611
00:45:01,902 --> 00:45:04,030
Besides, I don't speak Arabic.

612
00:45:04,138 --> 00:45:06,835
Well, what...?

613
00:45:11,044 --> 00:45:12,273
That's all we needed.

614
00:45:12,379 --> 00:45:15,280
Are you trying that old trick on me?

615
00:45:15,382 --> 00:45:17,578
Please, Antoine. It's not funny.

616
00:45:34,268 --> 00:45:37,294
Doesn't look like
there's much traffic on this road.

617
00:45:38,038 --> 00:45:40,700
Nathan probably
tried to work on the car again.

618
00:45:41,442 --> 00:45:43,911
Look at this. He replaced the fuse
with a piece of wire.

619
00:45:44,011 --> 00:45:45,979
- Is it serious?
- What an idiot.

620
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,411
I shouldn't have washed
the windshield.

621
00:45:47,514 --> 00:45:50,916
The water created a short circuit.

622
00:45:51,018 --> 00:45:53,146
I could have ruined
the wiring harness.

623
00:45:53,253 --> 00:45:56,052
Well, I didn't know you
were such an expert mechanic!

624
00:45:56,156 --> 00:45:59,922
I had to learn, Antoine.
I don't have a driver.

625
00:46:01,328 --> 00:46:05,162
I feel like you're giving me grief
for having money. It's tiresome.

626
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,161
Are you going to be able to fix it?

627
00:46:08,268 --> 00:46:11,363
No. We need a mechanic.

628
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:13,939
Can I use your cell phone?

629
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:17,944
For once that we were alone,
I didn't want to be interrupted.

630
00:46:18,045 --> 00:46:20,742
I don't have my phone, either.
I always forget it.

631
00:46:26,053 --> 00:46:28,044
So what do we do?

632
00:46:29,089 --> 00:46:31,023
Well...

633
00:46:35,062 --> 00:46:37,963
I'll show you the house, anyway.
Come with me.

634
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:40,664
We'll take the shortcut.

635
00:46:47,308 --> 00:46:48,571
What are you thinking of?

636
00:46:48,676 --> 00:46:50,644
Nothing in particular.

637
00:46:51,612 --> 00:46:55,014
I'm thinking I would like us to get
lost, where nobody could find us.

638
00:46:55,115 --> 00:46:56,708
No risk of that over here.

639
00:46:56,817 --> 00:46:58,808
You can always find your way
by looking at the sea.

640
00:46:58,919 --> 00:47:00,614
Look, right over there.

641
00:47:01,588 --> 00:47:03,420
It's strange, but I have the feeling

642
00:47:03,524 --> 00:47:07,154
you completely forgot about me
all these years.

643
00:47:07,261 --> 00:47:09,389
It's only normal.
I don't live in the past.

644
00:47:09,496 --> 00:47:11,464
I have a life, Antoine. You saw that.

645
00:47:11,565 --> 00:47:13,499
Alas, I did.

646
00:47:16,069 --> 00:47:17,833
For me, it's the opposite.

647
00:47:17,938 --> 00:47:20,839
Absence brought me closer to you.

648
00:47:20,941 --> 00:47:23,672
As time passed,
I missed you even more.

649
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,642
You want me to believe that you
have missed me for 30 years?

650
00:47:28,749 --> 00:47:32,617
31 years, eight months, and 20 days,
to be precise.

651
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:36,019
But I always knew
I would see you again.

652
00:47:36,123 --> 00:47:38,387
It's a coincidence, Antoine.

653
00:47:38,492 --> 00:47:41,860
Oh, no, it is not. I looked for you.
What do you think?

654
00:47:45,332 --> 00:47:47,664
One day I found out
that you lived here.

655
00:47:47,768 --> 00:47:51,204
The hardest part
was to be sent to Tangiers.

656
00:47:51,739 --> 00:47:54,970
It took some time.
I did everything I could.

657
00:47:55,075 --> 00:47:58,636
Anyway, I couldn't come any sooner.

658
00:47:58,746 --> 00:48:00,646
I don't really understand
what you're getting at.

659
00:48:00,748 --> 00:48:05,413
We said we would love each other
all our lives.

660
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:06,418
You don't remember?

661
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,818
What are you talking about?
I am sure you loved other women.

662
00:48:08,922 --> 00:48:12,722
I am not talking about sex.
It has nothing to do with it.

663
00:48:12,826 --> 00:48:15,420
Love doesn't change
like one changes partners.

664
00:48:15,529 --> 00:48:17,657
What do you want from me, exactly?

665
00:48:17,765 --> 00:48:20,860
I want to grow old with you.

666
00:48:20,968 --> 00:48:24,165
You're completely nuts,
my poor Antoine!

667
00:48:24,271 --> 00:48:29,971
I knew you would say that.
It doesn't matter.

668
00:48:30,077 --> 00:48:32,011
I don't want to force it on you.

669
00:48:33,047 --> 00:48:34,606
I will wait.

670
00:48:42,389 --> 00:48:43,914
Did you send those flowers?

671
00:48:44,024 --> 00:48:50,657
Yes, I knew you liked roses.
I am happy you understood.

672
00:48:50,764 --> 00:48:53,233
Listen, Antoine. If you want to see me
again, don't talk about any of this.

673
00:48:53,334 --> 00:48:54,460
We're not 20 anymore.

674
00:48:54,568 --> 00:48:57,697
Passion is behind us.
All right?

675
00:48:57,805 --> 00:48:59,398
Fine, as you wish.

676
00:49:02,242 --> 00:49:03,869
What's ahead of us, then?

677
00:49:03,978 --> 00:49:05,946
Nothing.

678
00:49:06,046 --> 00:49:08,845
It's like this forest. It stops here.
Beyond, there's a cliff.

679
00:49:08,949 --> 00:49:11,316
There's nothingness.

680
00:49:12,986 --> 00:49:15,751
That's not true. It isn't nothingness.

681
00:49:15,856 --> 00:49:20,157
There's the sea.
And look, there's a ferry crossing.

682
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:21,625
Over there, there's some fog.

683
00:49:21,729 --> 00:49:25,029
Behind the fog is Spain,
and Spain is the beginning of Europe.

684
00:49:25,132 --> 00:49:30,036
Stop it, Antoine. You're tiring me.
I even forgot why we came here.

685
00:49:30,137 --> 00:49:32,834
You wanted to show me the house.

686
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:35,432
That's right. The house.
It's that one.

687
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,912
Don't look at them like that.
They'll feel obliged to do something.

688
00:49:49,023 --> 00:49:50,047
You knew they were there?

689
00:49:50,157 --> 00:49:51,124
Of course. I saw them.

690
00:49:51,225 --> 00:49:55,093
They know they have nothing to fear
from us. We're just two lovers.

691
00:49:57,431 --> 00:50:02,198
Between police raids and robbers,
I don't know how they survive.

692
00:50:02,303 --> 00:50:06,501
Maybe they survive because
they have a goal. To reach Europe.

693
00:50:06,607 --> 00:50:09,133
This is the last stop before paradise.

694
00:50:35,803 --> 00:50:37,430
Is Cécile home?

695
00:50:38,138 --> 00:50:41,233
She went shopping with Sa'l'd.

696
00:50:42,509 --> 00:50:43,738
Is Sami still asleep?

697
00:50:43,877 --> 00:50:45,072
You want me to wake him up?

698
00:50:45,179 --> 00:50:47,079
No, I came to see you.

699
00:50:52,019 --> 00:50:53,748
Did you write this?

700
00:50:55,989 --> 00:50:57,218
Are you out of your mind?

701
00:50:57,324 --> 00:50:59,292
The pharmacist knows my handwriting.
There aren't that many doctors here.

702
00:50:59,393 --> 00:51:04,194
She refused to serve me.
I'm not surprised she called you.

703
00:51:05,999 --> 00:51:09,458
Do you often take that kind of crap?

704
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:13,598
I am an adult.
I can do whatever I want.

705
00:51:15,943 --> 00:51:16,933
Let's talk about this with Sami.

706
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,674
Let me go! You're hurting me!

707
00:51:29,823 --> 00:51:33,225
Listen, Semi. Either you keep an eye
on your friend or you leave.

708
00:51:33,327 --> 00:51:35,352
What the hell is going on?

709
00:51:35,462 --> 00:51:37,157
Don't yell at me. I don't know
what you're talking about.

710
00:51:37,264 --> 00:51:39,494
Come with me. Go ahead.

711
00:51:44,171 --> 00:51:46,230
That girl is a wreck.
And she has a kid, on top of it.

712
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:48,274
You're completely irresponsible.

713
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:49,809
Calm down. Tell me what's going on.

714
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:51,776
What's going on
is that she's loaded on pills.

715
00:51:51,879 --> 00:51:56,180
It's dangerous.
She steals my prescriptions, too.

716
00:51:56,283 --> 00:51:58,718
I'm tolerant, but this goes
beyond the acceptable.

717
00:52:17,638 --> 00:52:18,332
Are you all right?

718
00:52:18,439 --> 00:52:22,376
Don't ask me if I'm all right every
five minutes. Yes, I am all right.

719
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:32,981
Mommy's hands are cold.

720
00:52:33,087 --> 00:52:34,782
Then let me carry you.

721
00:52:38,225 --> 00:52:40,455
So how does it feel to be tall?

722
00:52:40,561 --> 00:52:45,931
The lady read me a story about giants
last night. I'd like to meet one.

723
00:52:46,033 --> 00:52:49,230
Giants don't exist anymore.
Only midgets still exist.

724
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:52,367
Otherwise,
humans are the same height.

725
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,101
How tall do you think I will be?
As tall as you?

726
00:52:56,210 --> 00:53:00,545
I don't know. It's too soon to know.

727
00:53:04,551 --> 00:53:06,952
When can you know?

728
00:53:07,054 --> 00:53:10,183
You know it when it happens.
Come on. Let's fly!

729
00:53:32,279 --> 00:53:33,940
You don't want to play soccer?

730
00:53:34,047 --> 00:53:35,481
No, I don't know these guys.

731
00:53:35,582 --> 00:53:37,949
That way, you'll get to know them.

732
00:53:38,051 --> 00:53:39,246
You want to play on the slide?

733
00:53:39,353 --> 00:53:41,151
No, that's for little kids.

734
00:53:41,255 --> 00:53:42,984
Why don't we go to the beach?

735
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:45,320
Your mommy can't handle the sun.

736
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:50,764
Why did we come here?

737
00:53:50,864 --> 00:53:52,195
So you could have fun.

738
00:53:52,299 --> 00:53:53,994
I prefer watching television.

739
00:53:55,302 --> 00:53:58,237
Vacation is not
for watching television.

740
00:53:58,338 --> 00:54:00,238
I can't believe you still
haven't been to the sea.

741
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:04,402
I don't want to go with the lady.
Why don't we go? Just you and me?

742
00:54:04,512 --> 00:54:07,106
Don't bother him with that. He doesn't
have time. He has things to do.

743
00:54:07,214 --> 00:54:10,445
It's the same in Paris.
You never do anything with me.

744
00:54:10,551 --> 00:54:12,519
Can I go over there?

745
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:15,783
Yes. Be careful not to fall.

746
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:24,820
Do you want to go back to Paris?

747
00:54:24,932 --> 00:54:28,061
I don't want to stop you
from seeing Bilal.

748
00:54:28,168 --> 00:54:30,136
Bilal is just a fling, you know.

749
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:34,434
He's not essential. You're
the most important thing. Seriously.

750
00:54:36,143 --> 00:54:38,475
Would you rather stay
or go back to Paris?

751
00:54:40,748 --> 00:54:45,049
I am unable to make any decisions.

752
00:54:45,152 --> 00:54:47,382
Okay, let's go back.
I'm making the decision.

753
00:54:50,324 --> 00:54:52,725
Sometimes,
I feel like I'm ruining your life.

754
00:54:52,826 --> 00:54:55,352
Are you kidding? If I didn't have you,
I don't know what I would do.

755
00:54:55,462 --> 00:54:57,897
You would live with a boy.

756
00:54:57,998 --> 00:55:01,366
Don't say that. I'm happy with you.
Seriously.

757
00:55:12,913 --> 00:55:14,745
Why are you wearing
this much makeup?

758
00:55:16,817 --> 00:55:20,151
I looked dead this morning,
so I added a little colour.

759
00:55:31,231 --> 00:55:33,165
What are you doing?

760
00:55:33,267 --> 00:55:35,395
Cleaning the swimming pool,
as I do each year.

761
00:55:35,502 --> 00:55:37,834
So you'll put a tarp on it, and we
won't be able to swim anymore?

762
00:55:37,938 --> 00:55:40,305
There are still some nice days
in September.

763
00:55:44,778 --> 00:55:47,770
Once again, I do something,
and it's wrong.

764
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:53,284
I was surprised, that's all.
I'm sorry.

765
00:56:09,370 --> 00:56:11,805
I need to give an answer
about Casablanca.

766
00:56:11,905 --> 00:56:16,240
Go ahead, if you want. I've already
told you I didn't want to live there.

767
00:56:16,343 --> 00:56:19,074
It could be a good thing, you working
in Casablanca and me working here.

768
00:56:19,179 --> 00:56:22,513
At least, we would see each other
only when we wanted to.

769
00:56:22,616 --> 00:56:27,178
Routine destroys relationships.
Don't use that old tired argument.

770
00:56:28,555 --> 00:56:30,523
All I see is a better
financial situation.

771
00:56:30,624 --> 00:56:31,989
This month, I am completely broke.

772
00:56:32,092 --> 00:56:34,424
What do you mean?

773
00:56:34,528 --> 00:56:36,690
I gave Sami some money for Nadia.

774
00:56:36,797 --> 00:56:39,061
She needs to go to rehab
in a proper institute,

775
00:56:39,166 --> 00:56:40,793
where they can do a good follow up.

776
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:43,768
What about the kid?
Will Sami take care of him?

777
00:56:43,871 --> 00:56:45,999
Yes, the time for her to recover.

778
00:56:46,106 --> 00:56:48,006
Do you see Sami raising a child?

779
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:51,945
He will learn. He'll figure it out,
like everybody else.

780
00:56:52,046 --> 00:56:54,515
Sure, let him deal with it.
I think you don't really care.

781
00:56:54,615 --> 00:56:55,548
I do care.

782
00:56:55,649 --> 00:56:57,708
I talked about it with him.
We get along well.

783
00:56:57,818 --> 00:56:59,047
I noticed.

784
00:57:00,587 --> 00:57:02,715
You keep smiling at each other.

785
00:57:03,657 --> 00:57:06,558
We understand each other.
It looks like it bothers you.

786
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:10,119
It bothers me because it's fake.
You don't know anything about Sami.

787
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:14,098
You don't even know he likes boys and
you're talking about understanding.

788
00:57:14,201 --> 00:57:19,332
What? He likes boys?
Did he tell you that?

789
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,465
No, but I've known for a long time.

790
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:25,001
And how do you know that?
You've seen him have sex with a man?

791
00:57:25,112 --> 00:57:26,170
Don't over-dramatize.

792
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,772
I know because I watch him.
I pay attention to him.

793
00:57:28,883 --> 00:57:31,250
It's important to know these things.

794
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:34,816
Maybe we should talk
about it with him.

795
00:57:34,922 --> 00:57:37,948
I don't want to talk about that crap.
It's pointless.

796
00:57:39,059 --> 00:57:41,357
You're not going to cop out?
It's your son, after all!

797
00:57:41,462 --> 00:57:44,227
My son, my son. What does it mean?
Don't get on my nerves with this!

798
00:57:44,331 --> 00:57:45,799
Stop yelling!

799
00:57:45,899 --> 00:57:48,800
We can't even have a simple and
direct conversation in this house.

800
00:57:48,902 --> 00:57:51,633
Listen, Cecile.
This is simple and direct.

801
00:57:51,738 --> 00:57:53,900
If you want to get involved in your
son's sex life, it's your problem.

802
00:57:54,008 --> 00:57:56,375
I consider that it's
none of my business.

803
00:57:57,912 --> 00:57:59,937
I'm going out. I am not sleepy.

804
00:58:04,818 --> 00:58:07,446
<i>I am dedicating this song to all
my friends in the neighborhood.</i>

805
00:58:07,554 --> 00:58:11,821
<i>Youssef Borkl, lssam,
Adlssad Gaza, Younes, AIssa,</i>

806
00:58:11,925 --> 00:58:14,826
<i>all my family, and my friend Salma.</i>

807
00:58:14,928 --> 00:58:17,863
<i>To my love, Ghlzlane,
I love her very much.</i>

808
00:58:32,613 --> 00:58:35,275
- Absolutely.
- It's not the first time.

809
00:58:35,382 --> 00:58:37,077
Hello. I hope I'm not bothering you.

810
00:58:37,184 --> 00:58:37,912
Not at all.

811
00:58:38,018 --> 00:58:39,782
I just wanted to see how it's done.

812
00:58:39,887 --> 00:58:41,719
- You want some coffee?
- No, thank you.

813
00:58:41,822 --> 00:58:42,914
Come here.

814
00:58:43,057 --> 00:58:45,526
<i>I dedicate this beautiful song
to my mother, my father,</i>

815
00:58:45,626 --> 00:58:47,788
<i>my sister, Anna,
and my little brother, Zacarlah.</i>

816
00:58:47,895 --> 00:58:49,659
You're lucky.
We have great songs tonight.

817
00:58:49,763 --> 00:58:50,992
...if you don't know my name.

818
00:58:51,098 --> 00:58:53,829
Thank you.

819
00:58:53,934 --> 00:58:57,802
And here is a song
requested from Germany.

820
00:58:57,905 --> 00:58:59,771
- Get out of here, Antoine. Out!
- But--

821
00:58:59,873 --> 00:59:00,567
There are no "buts."

822
00:59:00,674 --> 00:59:01,664
I am tired of you imposing yourself.

823
00:59:01,775 --> 00:59:03,174
You come to my house
without warning!

824
00:59:03,277 --> 00:59:06,269
Now you show up when I'm at work!
That's harassment!

825
00:59:06,914 --> 00:59:07,779
You seem on edge.

826
00:59:07,881 --> 00:59:08,905
Shut up, Antoine. Leave!

827
00:59:09,016 --> 00:59:11,178
I don't want to see you anymore!
Never!

828
00:59:11,618 --> 00:59:17,853
This song was requested by Aydan,
to all her family and friends.

829
00:59:19,059 --> 00:59:21,926
Now we're going to listen to
"Okam Bale" by Angélique Kidjo.

830
00:59:22,029 --> 00:59:24,191
And here is the song
by Angelique Kidjo.

831
00:59:51,292 --> 00:59:53,886
It's the fourth version of
the British-American resolution

832
00:59:53,994 --> 00:59:54,825
presented to the UN.

833
00:59:54,929 --> 00:59:58,331
The Americans hope for a vote.

834
00:59:58,432 --> 01:00:00,423
They're hoping, but nothing is done.
It's the fourth reunion--

835
01:00:00,534 --> 01:00:05,131
On site, two individuals
were found dead.

836
01:00:06,106 --> 01:00:10,339
Cécile! You see, he's not here.

837
01:00:10,444 --> 01:00:12,879
Look, Rachel. I know him by heart.
He won't give up so easily.

838
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:15,312
The only thing he's interested in
is making a mess of my life.

839
01:00:17,417 --> 01:00:18,976
I'm sure he's hiding somewhere.

840
01:00:19,086 --> 01:00:20,554
As you can see, there is nobody out.

841
01:00:20,654 --> 01:00:22,122
Where's your car?

842
01:00:22,222 --> 01:00:23,690
I took it to the mechanic.
It broke down.

843
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:24,723
Can you give me a ride?

844
01:00:24,825 --> 01:00:28,090
No problem.
I can't believe you're so nervous.

845
01:00:28,195 --> 01:00:29,526
All this for a ghost.

846
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:30,756
A ghost.

847
01:00:30,864 --> 01:00:33,231
Do you think you can safely see
a ghost you were madly in love with?

848
01:00:33,334 --> 01:00:34,733
I don't know what happened
between you two.

849
01:00:34,835 --> 01:00:38,772
You never wanted to talk about it.
So you were madly in love with him?

850
01:00:38,872 --> 01:00:43,571
Yes. It was both lust and love.
I never found that with any other man.

851
01:00:43,677 --> 01:00:44,803
I have desired Nathan.

852
01:00:44,912 --> 01:00:48,041
He gave me a lot of pleasure,
but I could never really love him.

853
01:00:48,148 --> 01:00:49,877
I see him as an enemy.

854
01:00:52,653 --> 01:00:55,350
- Let's close it. It's cold.
- Thanks.

855
01:00:56,924 --> 01:01:00,383
One, two, three. Come on.

856
01:01:17,277 --> 01:01:20,042
You should sleep with Antoine.
That's the only way to end it.

857
01:01:20,147 --> 01:01:23,242
It happened to me in New York.
Some guy I hadn't seen for 10 years.

858
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:27,014
We met randomly, we spent a night
together and after that,

859
01:01:27,121 --> 01:01:28,316
we realized that it was over.

860
01:01:28,422 --> 01:01:29,981
There was nothing left between us.

861
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:34,084
We said goodbye without pain,
feeling a great relief.

862
01:01:34,194 --> 01:01:36,822
It has nothing to do with Antoine.
It's not about sleeping with him.

863
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:38,364
It's something else.

864
01:01:39,933 --> 01:01:42,925
I have the feeling
that after all these years,

865
01:01:43,036 --> 01:01:46,563
he came to find me in Tangiers
to claim what he is owed.

866
01:02:25,646 --> 01:02:27,740
Place your bets, please.

867
01:02:27,848 --> 01:02:29,077
Four. Six.

868
01:02:31,084 --> 01:02:34,281
The bets are placed. Thank you.

869
01:02:37,358 --> 01:02:39,019
21, red.

870
01:02:41,361 --> 01:02:43,352
I'd like to cash out, please.

871
01:02:50,571 --> 01:02:52,266
Thank you.

872
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:01,578
Good evening, sir.

873
01:03:03,651 --> 01:03:04,243
20,000.

874
01:03:18,932 --> 01:03:21,424
Here you go. 20,000 dinars.
Thank you.

875
01:03:39,419 --> 01:03:41,786
Good evening, doctor.
I didn't know you were a gambler.

876
01:03:41,889 --> 01:03:44,119
I never gamble.
I am absolutely not suicidal.

877
01:03:44,224 --> 01:03:46,056
Then what are you doing here?

878
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,356
As you can see, nothing special.
I am drinking.

879
01:03:48,462 --> 01:03:50,430
It's the only place
open day and night.

880
01:03:50,531 --> 01:03:54,161
It's strange how things
close early in this city.

881
01:03:54,268 --> 01:03:55,793
It's the same everywhere
when it's off-season, isn't it?

882
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:57,997
September is still summer.

883
01:03:58,105 --> 01:04:00,096
That's what my wife says.

884
01:04:00,207 --> 01:04:01,572
May I?

885
01:04:02,877 --> 01:04:05,209
Did she tell you how we met?

886
01:04:05,312 --> 01:04:08,111
No, she just said you were in love
with her when you were kids.

887
01:04:08,215 --> 01:04:10,115
Kids? Really?

888
01:04:10,217 --> 01:04:12,049
She also said you were
possessive and jealous.

889
01:04:12,152 --> 01:04:13,551
It's only normal.
She was important to ma.

890
01:04:13,654 --> 01:04:17,454
She left me to marry a psychiatrist.
That guy was definitely not a kid.

891
01:04:17,558 --> 01:04:19,048
He was 10 years older than her.

892
01:04:19,159 --> 01:04:23,323
Dr. Bertrand Ferry. Do you know him?

893
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:25,159
Yes, she lived with him
when I met her.

894
01:04:25,266 --> 01:04:27,496
She followed you to Tangiers.
That's not surprising.

895
01:04:27,601 --> 01:04:30,935
No, first we lived in Casablanca.
That's where I am from.

896
01:04:31,038 --> 01:04:32,563
I have a lot of admiration
for you, doctor.

897
01:04:32,673 --> 01:04:36,234
You managed to settle with her.
That was my dream. It still is.

898
01:04:36,343 --> 01:04:42,009
If I may be frank, I came to Tangiers
hoping to take her from you.

899
01:04:44,518 --> 01:04:46,714
I am not sure she agrees.
Did you talk to her about it?

900
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:48,618
Of course. That's why I came.

901
01:04:48,722 --> 01:04:49,814
And?

902
01:04:49,957 --> 01:04:52,585
She said no.

903
01:04:52,693 --> 01:04:54,183
At least for now.

904
01:04:54,295 --> 01:04:57,697
She even told me
I wasn't allowed to see her.

905
01:04:57,798 --> 01:04:59,425
I don't know what to do.

906
01:05:00,367 --> 01:05:02,165
I am not sure I can help you.

907
01:05:02,269 --> 01:05:03,532
In fact, I think
I'm the wrong person for that.

908
01:05:03,637 --> 01:05:05,162
Obviously.

909
01:05:08,275 --> 01:05:10,505
Do you love her?

910
01:05:10,611 --> 01:05:12,943
After 20 years, couples are not
madly in love anymore.

911
01:05:13,047 --> 01:05:14,606
It's something else.

912
01:05:15,215 --> 01:05:16,740
Do you ever cheat on her?

913
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:19,376
Of course. She knows,
and she has no problem with it.

914
01:05:19,486 --> 01:05:22,319
That's right.
Polygamy is part of the culture.

915
01:05:22,423 --> 01:05:24,687
That's not it at all.

916
01:05:24,792 --> 01:05:27,159
I have one wife
and several mistresses.

917
01:05:27,261 --> 01:05:28,888
I also have more than one culture.

918
01:05:30,497 --> 01:05:33,797
She was always in my mind,
even when I was with other women.

919
01:05:33,901 --> 01:05:35,869
For me, it's the opposite.

920
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:39,270
Since I live with her,
I sometimes need novelty.

921
01:05:40,774 --> 01:05:44,802
I don't understand why you've waited
so long without writing or calling,

922
01:05:44,912 --> 01:05:46,346
without contacting her.

923
01:05:46,447 --> 01:05:50,975
I was afraid. You can't imagine
how much I was afraid.

924
01:05:51,085 --> 01:05:52,814
- Afraid of what?
- Afraid she would reject me.

925
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:55,753
Then I tried very hard to forget her,
but it didn't work.

926
01:05:55,856 --> 01:05:59,156
I did a lot of thinking and I thought:

927
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:01,888
"When I see her again, she'll be
older, her children will be married.

928
01:06:01,996 --> 01:06:04,761
My coming back may be good news,

929
01:06:04,865 --> 01:06:07,630
you know what I mean,
some kind of resurrection."

930
01:06:07,735 --> 01:06:09,100
I was wrong.

931
01:06:10,604 --> 01:06:11,833
She prefers staying with you.

932
01:06:18,679 --> 01:06:19,612
No.

933
01:06:19,713 --> 01:06:20,509
Here you go, sir.

934
01:06:20,614 --> 01:06:21,979
Let me pay for it.

935
01:06:35,062 --> 01:06:36,757
I'm sorry.

936
01:06:39,466 --> 01:06:42,925
<i>Cécile, what I feared has happened.</i>

937
01:06:43,037 --> 01:06:45,233
<i>I didn't find the words
to convince you.</i>

938
01:06:45,339 --> 01:06:48,570
<i>I thought a miracle was possible,
but the miracle didn't happen.</i>

939
01:06:56,183 --> 01:06:59,517
<i>I don't have a reason
to stay In this country anymore.</i>

940
01:07:00,554 --> 01:07:03,216
<i>I will ask to be replaced
on the construction site.</i>

941
01:07:03,324 --> 01:07:04,621
<i>I'll never be able to replace you,</i>

942
01:07:04,725 --> 01:07:06,784
<i>because the more I tried,
the less I succeeded.</i>

943
01:07:06,894 --> 01:07:08,453
<i>Today, I feel happy
after seeing you again.</i>

944
01:07:08,562 --> 01:07:11,623
<i>I managed to steal a few moments.</i>

945
01:07:11,732 --> 01:07:16,033
<i>The time marked by the clock doesn't
count, because in one look from you,</i>

946
01:07:16,136 --> 01:07:23,167
<i>one move, In the timber of your voice,
l' found eternity once again.</i>

947
01:07:23,277 --> 01:07:24,073
<i>. . recognize ma.</i>

948
01:07:24,178 --> 01:07:25,339
<i>It would be nice
If you closed your eyes.</i>

949
01:07:25,446 --> 01:07:26,538
<i>That way you would
only hear my voice.</i>

950
01:07:26,647 --> 01:07:27,944
<i>Every night, I hear yours
on the radio, I look at the city,</i>

951
01:07:28,048 --> 01:07:30,107
<i>and to me, you and the city become
one. Now, the moment has come--</i>

952
01:09:46,553 --> 01:09:48,749
Let's not stay here. I don't want
people to see me with a stranger.

953
01:09:48,856 --> 01:09:50,620
Especially not a man.

954
01:09:51,125 --> 01:09:53,958
Nadia told me to give you this.
They're CDs.

955
01:09:56,830 --> 01:09:59,231
Why do you refuse to see her?

956
01:09:59,333 --> 01:10:01,859
Because it's not good for me, Sami.

957
01:10:01,969 --> 01:10:04,802
You know, I saw the Taleb last year,
when I was sick.

958
01:10:04,905 --> 01:10:07,738
He told me that twin sisters
have to separate once and for all,

959
01:10:07,841 --> 01:10:09,639
if they want to have a life.

960
01:10:10,611 --> 01:10:14,707
Sa'l'd and I could come eat
at McDonald's. Children love that.

961
01:10:14,815 --> 01:10:16,249
That way, you'll meet him.

962
01:10:16,350 --> 01:10:18,284
I am not allowed to talk to clients
when I work.

963
01:10:18,385 --> 01:10:20,615
You won't talk to him,
but you'll see him.

964
01:10:21,622 --> 01:10:23,090
Does he speak Arabic?

965
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:25,852
No, Nadia, and I speak French.
We live in Paris. It's expected.

966
01:10:27,161 --> 01:10:28,287
Is he circumcised?

967
01:10:28,395 --> 01:10:31,194
You know, Nadia.
She doesn't care about religion.

968
01:10:31,298 --> 01:10:33,767
What does that mean?
He's not Muslim?

969
01:10:33,868 --> 01:10:35,768
He has a Moroccan passport.

970
01:10:35,869 --> 01:10:37,701
I handled it myself.
Everything's fine.

971
01:10:37,805 --> 01:10:39,136
Does he have your name?

972
01:10:39,239 --> 01:10:41,606
No, his mother's name.

973
01:10:42,576 --> 01:10:45,841
Why don't you get married?
Wouldn't it make things easier?

974
01:10:45,946 --> 01:10:49,405
I don't know.
We never talked about it.

975
01:10:49,516 --> 01:10:51,416
Nadia needs a real husband.

976
01:10:51,519 --> 01:10:53,988
She waited too long,
and she was very unlucky with men.

977
01:10:54,088 --> 01:10:56,580
I disagree. She just experienced life.

978
01:10:56,690 --> 01:10:58,522
Besides, it gave her SaTd.
That's good, right?

979
01:10:58,626 --> 01:11:02,119
I know that she's unhappy.
I know her better than you do.

980
01:11:02,796 --> 01:11:04,195
I have my mother's car.
Do you need a ride?

981
01:11:05,633 --> 01:11:10,070
No, I'm fine. I am used to
walking home. It's healthy.

982
01:11:13,073 --> 01:11:16,532
It was good to see you.
Take good care of her.

983
01:11:16,644 --> 01:11:20,706
Now that she doesn't have a sister,
I'm glad she still has a brother.

984
01:11:23,551 --> 01:11:27,249
A'l'cha! Nadia wanted to know
how your parents were doing.

985
01:11:27,354 --> 01:11:30,289
Tell her that our father went to
Agadir to work during the season,

986
01:11:30,391 --> 01:11:34,658
and our mother stayed in the village
to rest after her operation.

987
01:11:34,795 --> 01:11:37,765
Here. It's not much, but it would
make me happy if you took this.

988
01:11:38,999 --> 01:11:40,364
It was her idea or your idea?

989
01:11:40,468 --> 01:11:42,197
Both of us.

990
01:11:42,303 --> 01:11:44,067
You know what the Taleb says?

991
01:11:44,171 --> 01:11:45,969
A piece of meat earned by working

992
01:11:46,073 --> 01:11:48,667
is worth more than a lamb
offered out of sympathy.

993
01:11:49,276 --> 01:11:51,244
Does that mean you don't want it?

994
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:57,378
Yes, I'll take the money. I need it.

995
01:11:58,285 --> 01:11:59,582
Thank you.

996
01:12:57,044 --> 01:12:58,773
12 dinars, please.

997
01:13:12,326 --> 01:13:15,887
One Coke, small fries. Okay.
And a cheeseburger.

998
01:13:31,979 --> 01:13:33,140
For here or to go?

999
01:15:22,356 --> 01:15:23,755
Bilal!

1000
01:15:27,194 --> 01:15:28,684
Bilal!

1001
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:31,291
Go away!

1002
01:15:31,398 --> 01:15:32,422
Go away!

1003
01:15:37,771 --> 01:15:39,500
It hurts.

1004
01:15:42,643 --> 01:15:44,805
You're not going to burn my leg?

1005
01:15:44,912 --> 01:15:45,879
It's the only way.

1006
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:49,541
To do what? You don't heal a dog bite
by burning the wound. That's torture.

1007
01:15:49,650 --> 01:15:51,345
I'm telling you, I've already done it.

1008
01:15:51,452 --> 01:15:54,444
You always think you know everything,
and you know nothing.

1009
01:15:54,555 --> 01:15:55,920
My father taught me how to do it.

1010
01:15:56,023 --> 01:15:58,720
It stops the bleeding,
it kills the germs, it dries the--

1011
01:15:58,826 --> 01:16:00,658
I don't know how to say it.

1012
01:16:00,761 --> 01:16:02,456
Cauterize.

1013
01:16:03,697 --> 01:16:06,291
You have to do it with the house key.

1014
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,801
The house key?
What the hell are you talking about?

1015
01:16:08,903 --> 01:16:10,894
It keeps the bad spirits away.

1016
01:16:11,005 --> 01:16:13,235
Who cares about spirits?
I hope your dogs don't have rabies.

1017
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:17,106
No danger. The vet comes
to check them every month.

1018
01:16:17,244 --> 01:16:19,576
My boss likes to do things well.

1019
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:20,511
Let me see.

1020
01:16:20,614 --> 01:16:22,207
Stop it! Don't do that!

1021
01:16:23,651 --> 01:16:25,210
It's bad enough as it is.

1022
01:16:25,319 --> 01:16:27,447
I don't believe in your stupid
remedies, anyway.

1023
01:16:27,554 --> 01:16:31,218
See, you say I'm suspicious, but
you're the one who doesn't trust me.

1024
01:16:31,325 --> 01:16:32,451
It's not the same.

1025
01:17:00,988 --> 01:17:03,320
I hope they won't need to amputate.

1026
01:17:03,424 --> 01:17:04,858
Would you sleep with me
if I only had one leg?

1027
01:17:04,959 --> 01:17:06,324
Stop it, Sami.

1028
01:17:08,829 --> 01:17:11,264
If you could change one thing
when we have sex, what would it be?

1029
01:17:11,365 --> 01:17:13,857
Sex is something we do
but don't talk about.

1030
01:17:15,836 --> 01:17:18,965
Your motorcycle is a beast.
How fast can it go?

1031
01:17:19,073 --> 01:17:20,563
125 mph on the freeway.

1032
01:17:20,674 --> 01:17:24,008
But you would have to go to Larache.
Around here you can't go that fast.

1033
01:17:24,111 --> 01:17:26,773
How did you pay for it?
Your loan story is phony.

1034
01:17:26,881 --> 01:17:27,609
It's a gift.

1035
01:17:27,715 --> 01:17:29,114
You won't tell me?

1036
01:17:29,216 --> 01:17:31,548
Stop it, Sami.
I don't owe you anything.

1037
01:17:32,519 --> 01:17:34,146
What time do we meet?

1038
01:17:34,255 --> 01:17:38,214
We won't meet today. I'm going back
to Paris. Media's not feeling well.

1039
01:17:38,325 --> 01:17:40,657
She's never well.
Why do you live with her?

1040
01:17:40,761 --> 01:17:43,025
I told you. Because we get along.

1041
01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:45,360
You always like to invent
chores for yourself.

1042
01:17:45,466 --> 01:17:50,666
She's a burden. She's nice, but she's
a burden. Give her a kiss for me.

1043
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:56,973
Here. It's an open plane ticket
to Paris. It's round trip.

1044
01:17:57,077 --> 01:17:59,205
Come see me whenever you want.

1045
01:18:00,548 --> 01:18:02,812
I can't leave my job that easily.

1046
01:18:02,917 --> 01:18:06,251
Besides, remember last time?
It was a hassle to get a visa.

1047
01:18:07,788 --> 01:18:10,587
It took a while, but it worked. You
just need to do it ahead of time.

1048
01:18:10,691 --> 01:18:13,820
If you have proof that you're going
to stay with someone, it's easy.

1049
01:18:13,928 --> 01:18:16,226
I don't know. I'll think about it.
I can't promise you anything.

1050
01:18:16,330 --> 01:18:17,559
You know how I feel about Paris.

1051
01:18:17,665 --> 01:18:20,100
I would much rather be a prince here
than a bum over there.

1052
01:18:20,334 --> 01:18:21,824
You won't be a bum.

1053
01:18:30,411 --> 01:18:34,871
I should go.
I wish you many good things.

1054
01:18:34,982 --> 01:18:36,916
See you next time.

1055
01:19:01,642 --> 01:19:03,770
How come you're already up?

1056
01:19:06,714 --> 01:19:08,546
I can't sleep.

1057
01:19:08,649 --> 01:19:10,981
Well, it's a good thing.

1058
01:19:11,085 --> 01:19:15,522
Look. A dog bit me.
I took a taxi home.

1059
01:19:15,623 --> 01:19:18,820
I wanted to walk home, and bam!

1060
01:19:18,926 --> 01:19:21,418
Is it serious?

1061
01:19:21,529 --> 01:19:22,462
No.

1062
01:19:22,563 --> 01:19:25,362
Let's go to the pharmacy.
I'll give you a shot.

1063
01:19:29,269 --> 01:19:31,169
- You want some coffee?
- Yes.

1064
01:19:34,375 --> 01:19:36,605
What time is it?

1065
01:19:36,711 --> 01:19:39,442
Almost 7:00.
You still don't have a watch?

1066
01:19:43,751 --> 01:19:48,951
SaTd should wake up soon.
That kid always wakes up early.

1067
01:19:49,056 --> 01:19:51,889
I noticed. He is very quiet, though.

1068
01:19:51,992 --> 01:19:53,391
He seems to be a very nice kid.

1069
01:19:58,065 --> 01:20:02,093
Not really. He won't let anyone
touch him, even his mother.

1070
01:20:04,905 --> 01:20:08,341
He's timid. It will go away.

1071
01:20:18,385 --> 01:20:20,319
There are weather issues.
Don't wait here for two hours.

1072
01:20:20,421 --> 01:20:22,014
You should just go home.

1073
01:20:22,122 --> 01:20:24,887
I would like to talk to you for
a while. We barely saw each other.

1074
01:20:24,992 --> 01:20:26,289
It's always like that.

1075
01:20:27,995 --> 01:20:29,759
I hope you don't mind, Nadia.
We're going to the cafe.

1076
01:20:29,864 --> 01:20:31,457
Not at all.

1077
01:20:33,334 --> 01:20:35,428
How's your job? You didn't tell me.

1078
01:20:35,536 --> 01:20:39,097
It's all right.
With overtime, I make a living.

1079
01:20:39,206 --> 01:20:41,197
You don't look too motivated.
No regrets?

1080
01:20:41,308 --> 01:20:41,866
No.

1081
01:20:41,976 --> 01:20:42,943
Two coffees.

1082
01:20:43,043 --> 01:20:44,704
I do regret having studied in France.

1083
01:20:44,812 --> 01:20:46,803
It would be hard
for me to find a job here.

1084
01:20:46,914 --> 01:20:48,348
Every time I come back here,
it's strange.

1085
01:20:48,449 --> 01:20:50,213
I don't know who I am anymore.

1086
01:20:50,317 --> 01:20:51,113
Why do you say that?

1087
01:20:51,218 --> 01:20:54,984
Look at your father. He studied
medicine in Paris and he works here.

1088
01:20:55,089 --> 01:20:57,581
It's very different. He speaks Arabic,
and he's at home here.

1089
01:20:57,691 --> 01:21:02,060
Besides, medicine is the same
everywhere. Whereas law...

1090
01:21:02,162 --> 01:21:03,527
I heard he was offered
twice his salary

1091
01:21:03,631 --> 01:21:04,723
to work in a hospital in Casablanca.

1092
01:21:04,832 --> 01:21:06,664
Why don't you want to go?

1093
01:21:06,767 --> 01:21:07,700
When did he tell you that?

1094
01:21:07,801 --> 01:21:10,736
This morning. When he gave me
the anti-tetanus shot.

1095
01:21:10,838 --> 01:21:12,533
He's impossible.

1096
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:14,836
I didn't know it was a secret.
It's always the same with you.

1097
01:21:14,942 --> 01:21:16,933
You want to talk, and when we talk
you dramatize everything.

1098
01:21:17,044 --> 01:21:18,034
I am not dramatizing.

1099
01:21:18,145 --> 01:21:21,137
My job is here at the radio. If I go
to Casablanca, I lose it. That's all.

1100
01:21:21,248 --> 01:21:23,114
I don't understand
why you're clinging to this job.

1101
01:21:23,217 --> 01:21:25,151
Considering how little you get paid.

1102
01:21:25,252 --> 01:21:28,187
I'm sure it would be good
for you both to have a new life.

1103
01:21:28,289 --> 01:21:30,758
You don't love him enough to say yes.

1104
01:21:30,858 --> 01:21:32,792
You think women always
have to be the ones to yield?

1105
01:21:32,893 --> 01:21:34,759
Not particularly.

1106
01:21:34,862 --> 01:21:36,921
For instance, I am going
back to Paris for Nadia.

1107
01:21:37,031 --> 01:21:39,159
She looks better just knowing
she is leaving this country.

1108
01:21:39,266 --> 01:21:40,165
Did you notice?

1109
01:21:40,267 --> 01:21:42,759
It's not the same.
You're not attached to anyone here.

1110
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:46,329
I do have someone.
Someone you don't know.

1111
01:21:48,676 --> 01:21:52,078
I don't know
if you're attached to anyone.

1112
01:21:52,179 --> 01:21:53,544
How can you say that?

1113
01:21:53,647 --> 01:21:56,412
You don't think I am able to love?

1114
01:21:56,517 --> 01:21:58,076
I don't know.

1115
01:22:03,290 --> 01:22:04,587
Hello.

1116
01:22:07,561 --> 01:22:08,995
Antoine?

1117
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:15,232
You look exhausted, Antoine.
Luckily, tomorrow is Sunday.

1118
01:22:15,336 --> 01:22:18,704
Unfortunately, we also work
on Sundays. We're late.

1119
01:22:20,975 --> 01:22:22,807
Do you have time to go have a drink?

1120
01:22:22,910 --> 01:22:26,676
Look at me. I need to change.

1121
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:28,771
We'll be more comfortable
in your room.

1122
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:32,681
If you say so. Come with me.

1123
01:22:41,228 --> 01:22:42,889
You have a nice view.

1124
01:22:49,337 --> 01:22:51,669
I wanted to call you,
but I didn't have your cell number.

1125
01:22:51,772 --> 01:22:56,141
Here. Help yourself.
I really need to take a shower.

1126
01:23:07,188 --> 01:23:08,519
What are you doing?

1127
01:23:11,625 --> 01:23:12,956
I don't want you to disappear.

1128
01:23:13,927 --> 01:23:15,053
I won't disappear, Antoine.

1129
01:23:15,162 --> 01:23:17,187
I'm the one who came to see you.
I'm happy to be here.

1130
01:23:17,298 --> 01:23:19,699
But if you lock me in,
that's not a good start.

1131
01:23:27,474 --> 01:23:28,942
I know you saw Nathan the other night.

1132
01:23:29,043 --> 01:23:32,843
Yes. We just said hi, from far away.

1133
01:23:38,519 --> 01:23:41,284
Here is what I came to tell you,
Antoine.

1134
01:23:42,122 --> 01:23:45,285
Your love story with me doesn't exist.

1135
01:23:45,392 --> 01:23:47,952
It's easier to love someone in
your head and dream about them

1136
01:23:48,062 --> 01:23:49,757
than deal with them on a daily basis.

1137
01:23:49,863 --> 01:23:52,127
You're like my friend Rachel.

1138
01:23:52,233 --> 01:23:53,997
Her lover lives in Rabat.

1139
01:23:54,101 --> 01:23:57,799
She talks to him on the phone every
day, but they never see each other.

1140
01:23:58,906 --> 01:24:00,567
There's a song about this.

1141
01:24:01,475 --> 01:24:04,001
<i>I love you even more
When you're not here</i>

1142
01:24:04,111 --> 01:24:05,840
<i>Because I can dream of you</i>

1143
01:24:10,184 --> 01:24:16,647
But see, I am here. I don't like
my body anymore. My life is a mess.

1144
01:24:16,757 --> 01:24:20,591
But I'm still fighting, even though
I lost control a little bit.

1145
01:24:21,996 --> 01:24:25,455
So what I'm suggesting is the opposite
of what you're offering me.

1146
01:24:25,566 --> 01:24:27,432
I can't commit
to spending my life with you,

1147
01:24:27,535 --> 01:24:29,094
but I'd like to rest
with you for a while.

1148
01:24:29,203 --> 01:24:33,800
Just a stop over.
And then, I'll go back to my life.

1149
01:24:33,908 --> 01:24:37,902
A stop over? What does that mean?

1150
01:24:38,012 --> 01:24:41,312
That's what I like best in life.
You forget the purpose of your trip.

1151
01:24:41,415 --> 01:24:46,410
You don't think about the itinerary
anymore. You stop to rest for a while.

1152
01:24:48,622 --> 01:24:51,751
All right. Let's stop over.

1153
01:24:53,294 --> 01:24:57,788
I would really like to change now.
Did you see my clothes?

1154
01:24:57,898 --> 01:25:00,162
I talk too much. Sorry.

1155
01:25:28,095 --> 01:25:29,688
Turn the light off.

1156
01:26:06,534 --> 01:26:10,368
I couldn't miss you.
I mean, you really look like her.

1157
01:26:10,471 --> 01:26:12,235
Sami insisted that I see you,

1158
01:26:12,339 --> 01:26:14,637
but he didn't tell me clearly
what the disease was.

1159
01:26:14,742 --> 01:26:15,937
Come with me, I'll give you a ride.

1160
01:26:16,043 --> 01:26:18,205
That way, we'll talk
about your mother in the car.

1161
01:26:18,312 --> 01:26:20,041
I don't want people in the
neighborhood to see me with a man.

1162
01:26:20,147 --> 01:26:22,275
If they do,
they won't respect me anymore.

1163
01:26:22,383 --> 01:26:23,908
Would you prefer going to a café?

1164
01:26:24,018 --> 01:26:27,977
I am not like Nadia.
I don't go to cafés.

1165
01:26:28,722 --> 01:26:29,951
Let's walk a little bit, then.

1166
01:26:30,057 --> 01:26:32,424
In the street? Today is Sunday.

1167
01:26:32,526 --> 01:26:35,860
Everyone will look at us.
Can't we go somewhere quieter?

1168
01:26:38,732 --> 01:26:41,167
We'll try to find something.
Come with me.

1169
01:26:52,279 --> 01:26:53,872
Well, get in.

1170
01:27:05,926 --> 01:27:07,394
Help me.

1171
01:27:12,866 --> 01:27:15,733
With synthetic hormones,
it's all about the right dosage.

1172
01:27:15,836 --> 01:27:17,531
Does she get her blood
analyzed regularly?

1173
01:27:17,638 --> 01:27:20,039
Yes, every month, she goes
to the hospital, in Tafraoute.

1174
01:27:20,140 --> 01:27:21,369
It's a little far, though.

1175
01:27:22,509 --> 01:27:23,704
Where does she live, exactly?

1176
01:27:23,811 --> 01:27:27,179
In Taouz. That's where
Nadia and I were born.

1177
01:27:28,282 --> 01:27:32,082
I hear it was quite an event.
They had never seen twins before.

1178
01:27:33,053 --> 01:27:36,182
Taouz? I don't know where it is.

1179
01:27:36,290 --> 01:27:40,227
It's in the middle of nowhere,
in the Ziz Valley.

1180
01:27:40,327 --> 01:27:43,763
Some people know it because
of the stones falling from the sky.

1181
01:27:43,864 --> 01:27:47,232
- Meteorites, right?
- Meteorites.

1182
01:27:47,334 --> 01:27:48,733
There are tons of them in the area.

1183
01:27:48,836 --> 01:27:52,272
They've been there for millions
of years. Nothing has moved.

1184
01:27:52,373 --> 01:27:54,068
There's no life. It's the desert.

1185
01:27:54,842 --> 01:27:56,503
This road isn't very good.

1186
01:27:56,610 --> 01:28:00,103
You wanted a quiet place.

1187
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:08,580
- Do you have family in Tangiers?
- No.

1188
01:28:10,091 --> 01:28:11,855
I hope you go out, a little bit.

1189
01:28:11,959 --> 01:28:14,553
No, I don't like places
where there are lots of people.

1190
01:28:14,662 --> 01:28:18,599
Nadia and I used to go to clubs.
She would dance. I never had fun.

1191
01:28:18,699 --> 01:28:21,168
Now that she's gone,
I prefer being by myself.

1192
01:28:21,268 --> 01:28:23,600
That way, boys don't bother me.

1193
01:28:23,704 --> 01:28:27,163
If you lock yourself up like this,
you'll never meet anyone.

1194
01:28:27,274 --> 01:28:29,572
I don't want to meet anybody.

1195
01:28:29,677 --> 01:28:34,410
Men all want the same thing.
If you knew how much I hate them.

1196
01:28:34,515 --> 01:28:36,005
I see.

1197
01:28:36,117 --> 01:28:38,449
In fact, I see that
you don't know them.

1198
01:28:38,552 --> 01:28:40,145
I don't want to know them.

1199
01:28:42,156 --> 01:28:45,285
Will you be shocked
if I strip to a bathing suit?

1200
01:28:45,392 --> 01:28:46,188
No.

1201
01:28:46,293 --> 01:28:47,954
I like the way you laugh.

1202
01:28:48,062 --> 01:28:50,087
You don't want to go in the water?

1203
01:28:50,197 --> 01:28:51,392
No, there's too much wind.

1204
01:28:51,499 --> 01:28:52,694
Besides, I would
have to take my clothes off.

1205
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,564
Look around, there's nobody here.

1206
01:28:54,668 --> 01:28:56,295
Are you afraid of me?

1207
01:28:56,770 --> 01:28:58,204
No.

1208
01:29:01,108 --> 01:29:04,544
Look, the coast is clear today.
You can see Spain.

1209
01:29:08,315 --> 01:29:10,409
I'm starting to get hungry.

1210
01:29:21,829 --> 01:29:23,263
I thought you wanted to go for a swim.

1211
01:29:24,999 --> 01:29:26,296
I'll go, then.

1212
01:29:56,897 --> 01:29:58,262
Where's everybody?

1213
01:29:58,365 --> 01:29:59,662
You know, it's Sunday.

1214
01:29:59,767 --> 01:30:00,928
What do you mean, it's Sunday?

1215
01:30:01,035 --> 01:30:02,469
You know we need
to get things moving.

1216
01:30:03,103 --> 01:30:04,434
Why aren't they working?

1217
01:30:05,706 --> 01:30:07,174
Let's go!

1218
01:30:07,274 --> 01:30:08,935
Hurry "P!

1219
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:44,410
Hello. I have a meeting
with Antoine Lavau.

1220
01:30:44,511 --> 01:30:45,569
I've been waiting for an hour.

1221
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:46,840
Did he leave a message for me?

1222
01:30:46,947 --> 01:30:48,073
One moment, please.

1223
01:30:48,182 --> 01:30:52,585
- There's a woman--
- Hold on a second.

1224
01:30:55,556 --> 01:30:57,081
- Hello.
- Hello.

1225
01:30:57,191 --> 01:30:59,125
Mr. Lavau had an accident.

1226
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:01,059
An accident?

1227
01:31:01,195 --> 01:31:04,495
After the rain, part of the
construction site collapsed.

1228
01:31:04,598 --> 01:31:07,761
He's in the hospital.
I'll give you the address.

1229
01:31:24,585 --> 01:31:27,384
My son called me last night.

1230
01:31:27,488 --> 01:31:31,322
He's going to spend Christmas in
a mountain cabin with some friends.

1231
01:31:32,259 --> 01:31:35,752
Otherwise, I still work with Rachel.
We've put together a new proposal.

1232
01:31:35,863 --> 01:31:38,195
I hope they say yes to this one.

1233
01:31:40,267 --> 01:31:42,395
I wonder if you can hear the rain.

1234
01:31:43,838 --> 01:31:46,034
It's my favourite noise.

1235
01:32:21,508 --> 01:32:24,671
I think he met someone,
but I didn't ask.

1236
01:32:27,081 --> 01:32:30,016
He moved all his belongings
to Casablanca.

1237
01:32:30,751 --> 01:32:35,154
I kept a bed, a coffee table
and the sofa chairs.

1238
01:32:35,256 --> 01:32:37,384
That's why I can't stay
for too long today.

1239
01:32:37,491 --> 01:32:41,394
I need to be back by 5:00 pm
to wait for the workers.

1240
01:32:41,495 --> 01:32:44,260
They're going to put all that stuff
in a storage space at Rachel's.

1241
01:32:44,365 --> 01:32:46,857
It will save me some money.

1242
01:32:48,903 --> 01:32:51,167
I'll have the same thing.

1243
01:32:51,272 --> 01:32:52,671
What's up?

1244
01:32:53,808 --> 01:32:55,537
They're taking him back to France.

1245
01:32:55,643 --> 01:32:57,338
Really?

1246
01:32:57,445 --> 01:32:59,846
I didn't know you could transport
someone who is in a coma.

1247
01:32:59,947 --> 01:33:02,075
They won't keep him in Tangiers.

1248
01:33:03,817 --> 01:33:06,047
They're transferring him to a special
clinic in Berck-sur-Mer,

1249
01:33:06,153 --> 01:33:08,019
in the Pas-de-Calais area.

1250
01:33:08,122 --> 01:33:09,453
When do they want to transfer him?

1251
01:33:09,557 --> 01:33:11,184
As soon as possible.

1252
01:33:11,292 --> 01:33:13,818
They're saying it doesn't make sense
to keep him here any longer.

1253
01:33:13,928 --> 01:33:15,828
Is someone going with him?

1254
01:33:15,929 --> 01:33:18,125
Yes. I'm going.

1255
01:33:18,232 --> 01:33:20,701
He didn't have any friends of family?

1256
01:33:20,801 --> 01:33:23,270
I don't like it when you talk
about him in the past.

1257
01:33:23,370 --> 01:33:25,395
I've never seen a man like him.

1258
01:33:25,506 --> 01:33:27,372
What do you mean?

1259
01:33:27,975 --> 01:33:31,570
Usually, women are the ones
to fall madly in love like that.

1260
01:33:36,050 --> 01:33:39,042
<i>Rachel decided to make
a Christmas tree this year.</i>

1261
01:33:39,153 --> 01:33:41,212
<i>She wanted to get an early start.</i>

1262
01:33:41,989 --> 01:33:46,688
<i>This morning, we got up early.
The weather was nice.</i>

1263
01:33:46,794 --> 01:33:48,922
<i>We went to Missnana. You remember?</i>

1264
01:33:49,029 --> 01:33:50,428
<i>That's the forest
where I showed you the house.</i>

1265
01:33:50,531 --> 01:33:52,659
<i>The illegal immigrants
were still there.</i>

1266
01:33:52,767 --> 01:33:53,563
<i>Maybe they were different ones.</i>

1267
01:33:53,667 --> 01:33:55,692
<i>They try their best to be anonymous,
so It's hard to know.</i>

1268
01:33:55,803 --> 01:33:57,100
You should have seen Rachel and me

1269
01:33:57,204 --> 01:33:59,901
dragging the Christmas tree
for 200 yards.

1270
01:34:00,641 --> 01:34:02,473
By the way, we had a hard time

1271
01:34:02,576 --> 01:34:04,169
fitting the furniture
in the storage space yesterday.

1272
01:34:04,278 --> 01:34:06,440
Especially the bed. It was too big.

1273
01:34:07,348 --> 01:34:09,578
I found this
underneath the box springs.

1274
01:34:10,718 --> 01:34:12,584
That was a crazy thing to do.

1275
01:34:12,687 --> 01:34:14,951
I wanted to tear it apart.
I didn't sleep all night.
