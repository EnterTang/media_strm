8
00:01:32,587 --> 00:01:34,255
我跟她保证要戒烟的
I promised her I quit smoking

9
00:01:34,255 --> 00:01:38,301

She think's it's bad for me. And I'm trying, but...

10
00:01:38,634 --> 00:01:41,763

It is 5.00 AM. Still shank of night for some.

但对曼尼斯来说 却是忙碌一天的开始
But, for Eddie Mannix, beginning of a new work day.

18
00:02:25,515 --> 00:02:30,144
他的片场工作不断

19
00:02:30,186 --> 00:02:35,400
有白天的闹剧 也有晚上的爱情戏
Each, it's on daylit drama, or moonlit dream.

20
00:02:35,525 --> 00:02:40,613
但曼尼斯可没有昼夜之分
But, the work of Essie Mannix cares not for day or night.

21
00:02:41,531 --> 00:02:44,701
更无暇休息

27
00:02:59,757 --> 00:03:01,426

28
00:03:01,426 --> 00:03:03,094

Can't a girl take a few pictures, have a few laughs?

31
00:03:09,434 --> 00:03:13,438

Cheez, Eddie. What a old sss-tick in the mud

32
00:03:14,731 --> 00:03:16,065
听好了
Now, you listen to me.

33
00:03:16,107 --> 00:03:17,734
你刚去了派对喝多了
You were at a party, you had too much to drink.

34
00:03:17,775 --> 00:03:20,111
你也记不得是谁把你带来这
Somebody brought you here, you don't remember who.

35
00:03:20,153 --> 00:03:21,696
快滚回家去
You're going home now,

Someone was pulling your leg. Mary Jo here was just at a costume party.

41
00:03:36,002 --> 00:03:37,920
这可不是她的紧身裙
It's not really her dirndl.

42
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,590
她只想帮你们的退休金尽点微薄之力
She wants to contribute something to your pension fund.

43
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,258
不好意思让你们冒雨前来

00:10:11,814 --> 00:10:14,442
保持兴奋!
Lots of energy!

128
00:10:15,693 --> 00:10:18,071
你在餐桌旁干嘛?!
What're you doing at the table of viands?!

129
00:10:18,112 --> 00:10:19,781
你不是该捧着七弦琴吗!
- Huh? - You're supposed to be reclining, with the lyre!

130
00:10:19,822 --> 00:10:22,450
抱歉    - 躺着捧着七弦琴!
- I... I'm sorry. - Recline with the lyre!

131
00:10:23,576 --> 00:10:26,079
别拄着像座山 躺着
Don't sit on the pediment. Recline.

132
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,330
放轻松 欢乐点!    - 好啦
- Relaxed, festive! - Alright.

133
00:10:27,372 --> 00:10:28,998
临时演员准备好没?   - 好了!
- Extras, set? - Set!

134
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,250
开始录影    - 我会盯着你
- Roll sound. - I got my eye on you.

135
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,920
开拍 喷泉!
Roll camera. Fountain!

136
00:10:34,545 --> 00:10:37,006
凯萨万岁! 第十幕 第十遍
Hail, Caesar! 10A . Take 10.

137
00:10:37,006 --> 00:10:39,342
开拍!
And action!

138
00:10:44,097 --> 00:10:45,515
喔脱落糗死!
Autolochus!

139
00:10:45,515 --> 00:10:49,227
听说你要回罗马!
I had heard rumors of your return to Rome!

140
00:10:49,268 --> 00:10:51,938
不只是听说 尊贵的塞满地兔屎!
More than rumors, noble Sestimus!

141
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,983
我知道你是巴克柯斯的崇拜者
I see that you are the same worshiper of Bacchus.

142
00:10:54,983 --> 00:10:56,401
真搞笑
What gaiety.

143
00:10:56,442 --> 00:10:58,236
常言说得好
There is still truth in the adage,

144
00:10:58,236 --> 00:11:01,823
What pleasures cannot be found in the villa of Sestimus Ainydias,
“在瑟斯提慕斯豪宅找不到的乐趣

145
00:11:01,823 --> 00:11:04,033
cannot be found in Rome!?
在罗马更找不到!”

146
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:08,413
但言归正传 听说参议院又要派我们军团出征
But seriously, there is talk that the senate will send our legions out again

147
00:11:08,454 --> 00:11:12,000
这次可不是去高卢
and this time not on a short march to Gaul.

148
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,669
这可是真的, 瑟斯提慕斯?
What truth to these mutterings, Sestimus?

149
00:11:14,711 --> 00:11:17,880
参议院是在计划
The matter has been taken up in the Senate.

150
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,051
巴勒斯坦乱成一团
It seems that there is unrest in Palestine.

151
00:11:22,093 --> 00:11:25,054
巴勒斯坦? 那可是与世隔绝的地方!
Palestine? That backwater!

152
00:11:25,096 --> 00:11:30,935
他们可不会派第六军团去那个鸟不生蛋的地方吧!
They'll hardly be sending the Sixth Legion to that godforsaken patch of desert!

153
00:11:33,021 --> 00:11:34,814
巴勒斯坦
Palestine.

154
00:11:34,856 --> 00:11:38,151
- Ah hahaha... - Ha ha ha...

155
00:11:38,192 --> 00:11:40,570
巴勒斯坦!
Palestine!

156
00:11:48,953 --> 00:11:51,539
先别停
Holding for a dissolve,

157
00:11:51,581 --> 00:11:53,583
继续笑
still laughing,

158
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,546
继续...卡
holding... and cut.

159
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,007
Fine, boys, that was just 铿ne.
很好 各位 很好

160
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:02,759
我表现可以吧?   - 停机!
- Was I alright? - It's a cut!

161
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,344
接着拍火炉场景
We'll move on to the brasier scene.

162
00:12:04,385 --> 00:12:05,845
我刚刚如何
Was I alright with the mutterings,

163
00:12:05,887 --> 00:12:07,638
我觉得有点...    - 没事 很好
- I felt a little... - Nah, it's fine.

164
00:12:07,638 --> 00:12:09,682
换位 二十分钟后 火炉场景
Moving on. Brasier scene, 20 minutes.

165
00:12:09,724 --> 00:12:11,059
赶到拖车那
Popping over to my trailer.

166
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,187
Okay, in the brasier scene, they changed passion?to ardor.?
好的 火炉那一幕 他们把“激情”改成“热情”

167
00:12:14,228 --> 00:12:17,315
什么? 为啥? 我喜欢激情
What? Why? I like passion.

168
00:12:17,315 --> 00:12:20,318
这才够厉害 激情!
It's strong. It's Passion!

169
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:28,451
这就是我在高卢待了三个月得到的问候?
Such is my greeting after three months' sojourn in Gaul?

170
00:12:28,451 --> 00:12:32,372
不是这样的 乌苏丽娜
Not so, Ursulina,

171
00:12:34,582 --> 00:12:37,585
我...我的热情...
my... my ardor...

172
00:12:37,627 --> 00:12:42,507
我的热情就像...火炉里的余烬一样温暖
my ardor is yet as warm... as the embers of this brasier.

173
00:12:42,548 --> 00:12:45,551
炉里的余烬...余烬
The embers of this brasier... brasier.

174
00:12:45,593 --> 00:12:49,764
大家在等你 会拉客先生 - 不是这样的 乌苏莉娜
- They're ready for you, Mr. Whitlock. - Not so, Ursulina.

175
00:12:58,398 --> 00:12:59,941
谢谢各位过来
Gentlemen, thank you all for coming

176
00:12:59,983 --> 00:13:03,569
I know you have parishes, 铿ocks and temples making enormous demands on your time.
我知道你们有教区一堆事务要忙

177
00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:06,531
但我很确定你们一定会很欣慰一般大众
But I'm sure you appreciate also that great masses of humanity

178
00:13:06,572 --> 00:13:10,201
看这部电影时会得到更多的教育
look to pictures for information and uplift and,

179
00:13:10,243 --> 00:13:12,120
和娱乐
yes, entertainment.

180
00:13:12,412 --> 00:13:14,580
我们首都影业...
Now here at Capitol Pictures, as you know,

181
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,835
我们专业的人员 演员... 和顶尖的创意人正日以继夜的确保...
an army of technicians and actors and top-notch artistic people are working hard

182
00:13:18,835 --> 00:13:21,838
把耶稣的故事搬上银幕
to bring to the screen the story of the Christ.

183
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:24,841
这是个了不起的故事 一个古老的故事
It's a swell story. A story told before, yes,

184
00:13:24,882 --> 00:13:27,135
but we like to 铿atter ourselves that it's never been told
但我们想把它当作从未被人讲过的故事

185
00:13:27,135 --> 00:13:29,303
投入如此大的制作成本和阵容
with this kind of distinction and panache.

186
00:13:29,345 --> 00:13:32,849
或许你忘了圣经里讲过
Perhaps, sir, you forget its telling in the holy Bible.

187
00:13:32,849 --> 00:13:35,310
Quite right, Patriarch. The Bible of course is terri铿c.
没错主教长 说到圣经 没错

188
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:37,061
但对千百万人来说
But, for millions of people,

189
00:13:37,103 --> 00:13:41,524
他们会在电影里找到对照
pictures will be their reference point for the story, the story's embodiment;

190
00:13:41,566 --> 00:13:43,484
找到故事的具体化形象 故事的...
The story's...

191
00:13:43,484 --> 00:13:45,820
寓意    - 寓意
- Realization. - Realization.

192
00:13:45,862 --> 00:13:49,657
You realize,?of course, that for we Jews,
当然了 对我们犹太人来说

193
00:13:49,657 --> 00:13:54,120
任何神灵的具体化形象都是严格禁止的
any visual depiction of the Godhead is most strictly prohibited.

194
00:13:54,162 --> 00:13:55,538
Oh.

195
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:59,125
但是 当然罗 对我们来说耶稣并不是上帝
But of course, for us, the man Jesus Nazarene is not God.

196
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,501
Ah-ha.

197
00:14:00,543 --> 00:14:02,128
谁演耶稣?
Who plays Christ?

198
00:14:02,128 --> 00:14:05,006
一个我们都很看好的年轻人 陶德何切伊瑟
A kid we're all very excited about, Todd Hocheiser,

199
00:14:05,048 --> 00:14:09,052
我们找遍全国在俄亥俄州找到的
wonderful young actor we found in Akron, Ohio in a nationwide talent hunt.

200
00:14:09,052 --> 00:14:12,638
陶德只是短暂露脸 保持高调
But Hocheiser is seen only fleetingly, and with extreme taste;

201
00:14:12,638 --> 00:14:15,850
我们的故事是从罗马保民官
our story is told through the eyes of a Roman tribune,

202
00:14:15,892 --> 00:14:20,605
Autolochus Antoninus, an ordinary man skeptical at 铿rst
喔脱落糗死的角度 一个普通人 最初半信半疑

203
00:14:20,647 --> 00:14:24,484
but who comes to a grudging respect for this swell 铿gure from the East.
但后来勉强尊重这位东方神

204
00:14:24,525 --> 00:14:27,320
演喔脱落糗死的是...
And Autolochus is played by. . .

205
00:14:27,737 --> 00:14:29,697
败德会拉客
Baird Whitlock.

206
00:14:29,739 --> 00:14:31,199
天啊
Oh my.

207
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,868
他还真有才华
Well, he is certainly a great talent.

208
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:37,121
"凯萨万岁!" 将会是部传世巨作 我们今年的大片
Now, "Hail, Caesar!" is a prestige picture; our biggest release of the year.

209
00:14:37,121 --> 00:14:39,582
我们投入巨大成本
We are devoting huge resources to its production

210
00:14:39,624 --> 00:14:42,168
in order to make it 铿rst-class in every respect.
以确保在各方面堪称一流

211
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:45,588
各位 鉴于巨大的投入 没有十足的把握这部片...
Gentlemen, given it's enormous expense we don't want to send it to market

212
00:14:45,588 --> 00:14:49,342
不会冒犯任何美国人的信仰和信条之前
except in the certainty that it will not offend any reasonable American,

213
00:14:49,384 --> 00:14:51,761
我们不会让它上映
regardless of faith or creed.

214
00:14:51,803 --> 00:14:54,138
所以我们请各位来 你们看过剧本了
Now that's where you come in. You've read the script;

215
00:14:54,138 --> 00:14:57,517
我想知道有没有因神学因素让这部片子夭折
I wanna know if the theological elements of the story are up to snuff.

216
00:14:57,517 --> 00:14:59,727
我感觉战车大一段太假了
I thought the chariot scene was fakey.

217
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:04,023
怎么可能有人在全速前进的战车上跳来跳去?
How is he going to jump from one chariot to the other, going full speed?

218
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:09,404
这个嘛 我们可以再研究
Uh-huh, well, we can look at that.

219
00:15:09,445 --> 00:15:12,240
但旧宗教方面而言呢...
But, as for the, religious aspect...

220
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:14,951
对耶稣的描述还算可以吧?
does the depiction of Christ Jesus cut the mustard?

221
00:15:14,993 --> 00:15:17,578
耶稣的本质并非你们剧本
Well. The nature of the Christ is not quite as simple

222
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,164
... 写得那么简单    - 怎么说呢 神父?
- ... as your photoplay would have it. - How so, Father?

223
00:15:20,164 --> 00:15:23,626
并非简简单单说耶稣是上帝 或者上帝就是耶稣
It is not the case simply that Christ is God, or God Christ.

224
00:15:23,668 --> 00:15:26,379
说的对! 拿札勒人不是上帝!
You can say that again! The Nazarene was not God!

225
00:15:26,421 --> 00:15:28,381
说他不是上帝不对   - 他只是凡人!
- He was not not-God. - He was a man!

226
00:15:28,423 --> 00:15:29,841
不全是神    - 不对 先生!
- Part God. - No sir!

227
00:15:29,882 --> 00:15:32,218
我们都有点神的气息 不是吗?
Rabbi, all of us have a little bit of God in us don't we?

228
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,846
这是我们信仰的精随
- Well... - It is the foundation of our belief

229
00:15:34,887 --> 00:15:38,933
耶稣往往被当作上帝的儿子
that Christ is most properly referred to as the son of God.

230
00:15:38,933 --> 00:15:43,396
上帝的儿子承担全世人的罪
It is the son of God who takes the sins of the world upon himself

231
00:15:43,438 --> 00:15:48,234
这样其他上帝的子民像我们这些不完美的人
so that the rest of God's children, we imperfect beings,

232
00:15:48,276 --> 00:15:52,905
透过信仰 才能到达天国
through faith, may enter the kingdom of heaven.

233
00:15:52,947 --> 00:15:57,243
也就是说上帝是...分身?   - 说是 也不是
- So God is. . . split? - Yes. And no.

234
00:15:57,243 --> 00:16:00,413
既分身 又合体    - 合而为一又分开
- There is unity in division. - And division in unity.

235
00:16:00,455 --> 00:16:01,831
我有点听没有 主教长
I'm not sure I follow, Padre.

236
00:16:01,873 --> 00:16:04,250
少年耶 你不懂 原因很简单
Young man, you don't follow for a very simple reason:

237
00:16:04,292 --> 00:16:06,753
这些人脑袋有问题? 上帝有孩子吗?
these men are screwballs. God has children?

238
00:16:06,794 --> 00:16:09,255
有养狗吗? 说不定还是条牧羊犬?
What, and a dog? A collie maybe?

239
00:16:09,297 --> 00:16:10,631
上帝没有孩子
God doesn't have children.

240
00:16:10,673 --> 00:16:12,467
他是单身汉 而且很生气
He's a bachelor. And very angry.

241
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:14,844
不对 他是生气过!   - 然后呢 气完罗?
- No, no. He used to be angry! - What, he got over it?

242
00:16:14,844 --> 00:16:17,388
你信的是另一个时代的上帝!  - 缺乏爱!
- You worship the god of another age! - Who has no love!

243
00:16:17,388 --> 00:16:19,015
不对! 他爱犹太人
Not true! He likes Jews.

244
00:16:19,057 --> 00:16:21,517
上帝爱众人!    - 上帝就是爱
- God loves everyone! - God is love.

245
00:16:21,517 --> 00:16:23,269
上帝就是上帝
God is who is.

246
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:25,229
这有啥奇怪的? 谁不是谁啊?
This is special? Who isn't who is?

247
00:16:25,271 --> 00:16:28,441
但上帝为何要出现在电影里?
But how should god be rendered in a motion picture?

248
00:16:28,483 --> 00:16:29,942
上帝才没出现在电影里!
God isn't in the motion picture!

249
00:16:29,984 --> 00:16:31,235
那陶德演谁?
Then who's Todd Hocheiser?

250
00:16:31,277 --> 00:16:34,155
各位 或许一时解答不了那么多问题
Gentlemen, maybe we're biting off more than we can chew.

251
00:16:34,155 --> 00:16:36,491
我们先暂时搁置神的本质
We don't need to agree on the nature of the deity here:

252
00:16:36,532 --> 00:16:40,453
我们先只看他表演 先不管他是谁...生的
if we can focus on the Christ, whatever his... parentage.

253
00:16:40,495 --> 00:16:43,706
我要问的是: 我们对他的描述公正吗?
My question is: is our depiction fair?

254
00:16:43,748 --> 00:16:45,333
还好啦
I've seen worse.

255
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,501
牧师?
Reverend?

256

不会冒犯到常人
There is nothing to offend a reasonable man.

257
00:16:49,545 --> 00:16:50,421
神父?
Father?

258
00:16:50,421 --> 00:16:56,386
剧本写得虔诚恭敬 品味独特 格调高雅
The motion picture teleplay was respectful and exhibited tastefulness and class.

259
00:16:56,386 --> 00:16:59,097
你几时变成专家了?
Who made you an expert all of a sudden?

260
00:16:59,681 --> 00:17:01,724
那拉比 你怎么看呢?
And, What do you think, Rabbi?

261
00:17:01,766 --> 00:17:05,103
不予置评
Eh. I haven't an opinion.

262
00:17:05,103 --> 00:17:08,314
怎么样呢?   - 我不...不错 怎么了?
How'd we do? - I don't... fine. What's up?

263
00:17:08,356 --> 00:17:09,857
Can't 铿nd Baird Whitlock.

他离开剧组有一小时了
He left the set over an hour ago,

265
00:17:11,693 --> 00:17:14,362
说要回他化妆室 但不在那
said he was going to his dressing room but he isn't there.

266
00:17:14,362 --> 00:17:16,656
嗑药去了? 大白天的? 我疯了不成
Out on a bender? Middle of the day? Am I crazy.

267
00:17:16,698 --> 00:17:18,408
你没疯 但就是不在
You're not crazy, but no.

268
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:21,953
我还找过酒吧 餐厅 摩铁 一个影子都没
I checked the Til Two, Dan Tana's, Rusty Scupper. Not a soul.

269
00:17:21,995 --> 00:17:23,621
还是回家了? 打给他老婆没?    - 打了
- Home, maybe? Called his Wife? - Yep.

270

What'd Laura say?

271
00:17:24,706 --> 00:17:27,583
他不在 他从没回家过 他就是个混蛋 问他小三去
He's not home, he's never home, he's a louse, try one of his chippies.

272
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,877

剧组有哪个女人不见了吗?    - 没
- Any of the gals missing from the set? - Nope.

274
00:17:32,422 --> 00:17:35,758
好 才消失一小时?  先别紧张
Alright, gone an hour? We won't worry yet.

275
00:17:42,223 --> 00:17:43,558
霍比?
Hobie?

276
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:47,145
公司说这里没你的事了 要你回摄影棚报到
The Studio says you're finished here and you're to report back to the Lot.

277
00:17:47,186 --> 00:17:49,939
干嘛?    - 要让你变身
- How come? - They're changing your image.

278
00:17:49,939 --> 00:17:51,107
Okay
Okay.

公司还说今晚你要护送卡洛塔去首映会
And the Studio says  you're escorting Carlotta Valdez to your premier tonight.

280
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,322
干嘛? 我又不认识她
How come? I don't know her.

281
00:17:57,322 --> 00:18:00,366
公司安排的 你身分不同了
Studio's arranging it, they're changing your image.

282
00:20:48,284 --> 00:20:49,744
去他的!
Damn it!

283
00:21:04,384 --> 00:21:06,094
夫人 你又胀气了吗(肚子更大了)?
You have gas again, ma'am?

284
00:21:06,135 --> 00:21:08,888
夫人? 叫我小姐! 我像结婚了吗?
Ma'am? Miss! Do I look married?

285
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:11,265
不像 小姐   - 不! 没错 又胀气了
- No, miss. - No! Yeah, gas again.

286
00:21:11,265 --> 00:21:14,811
问他吧 他知 好啦 一边去吧
Ask him, he knows. Alright, scram.

287
00:21:15,103 --> 00:21:17,146
狄安娜 还好吗?
How are you, DeeAnna?

288
00:21:17,188 --> 00:21:19,399
我好吗? 湿答答的
How am I? Wet.

289
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,901
I don't think I'm going to 铿t in that fish-ass after this week.
再过一星期 我就塞不进那该死的鱼尾巴了

290
00:21:21,943 --> 00:21:24,362
过明天 水上芭蕾组的人就可以当你替身了
Well, we should have the water ballet in the can after tomorrow;

291
00:21:24,404 --> 00:21:28,491
到夜总会那一幕会给你穿宽松的
in the nightclub scene, wardrobe'll have a gown for you that's more forgetting.

292
00:21:29,534 --> 00:21:32,203
有想嫁谁了吗(肚子又搞大了)?
Any more thoughts about who you might marry?

293
00:21:32,203 --> 00:21:34,247
我不在完那一套了 都结两次了
I ain't doing that again. I had 2 marriages,

294
00:21:34,288 --> 00:21:36,582
都还得靠公司花钱摆平
and it just cost the studio a lot of money to bust them up.

295
00:21:36,582 --> 00:21:39,419
Well, we had to have those annulled, one was to a minor mob 铿gure .
我们不得不解决那两段婚姻 一个混黑社会的

296
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,878
文森不是黑社会的!
Vince was not minor!

297
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,881
巴迪呢 是个吸毒的乐队主唱
And, Buddy Flynn was a bandleader with a long history of narcotic use.

298
00:21:43,881 --> 00:21:46,217
我就说嘛 两个都是混蛋
Yes, and that's what I'm saying, they were both louses.

299
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:48,177
在嫁第三个混蛋对我没好处
Marrying a third louse ain't gonna do me no good.

300
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:50,305
我们不是给你介绍几个不错人选
We've offered you some very suitable, clean young men.

301
00:21:50,305 --> 00:21:52,348
不是小白脸 就是软脚虾 娘娘腔 !
Pretty boys. Saps and swishes!

302
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:55,435
难道有可靠的好男人我会放过吗?
What? You think if there wasn't a good reliable man I wouldn't have grabbed him?

303
00:21:55,476 --> 00:21:58,187
那嗯嗯啊啊呢? 他是孩子的爹吧?
What about Arne Seslum? He is the father, isn't he?

304
00:21:58,229 --> 00:21:59,314
是啊
Yeah, yeah.

305
00:21:59,314 --> 00:22:01,774
婚姻不一定要天长地久 但迪安娜
Marriage doesn't have to last forever. But, DeeAnna,

306
00:22:01,816 --> 00:22:05,445
生出没爹的孩子 会给我们声誉带来麻烦
having a child without a father would present a public relations problem for the studio.

307
00:22:05,445 --> 00:22:07,572
拍水上芭蕾对我们形象大有好处...
The aquatic pictures do very nicely for us...

308
00:22:07,613 --> 00:22:11,200
So you go and strap on the 铿sh-ass and marry Arne Seslum.
那你去穿鱼尾巴啊嫁给嗯嗯啊啊好了

309
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,162
拍水上芭蕾不只对我们 对你都有好处
The pictures do well for all of us. And it's a tribute to you:

310
00:22:14,162 --> 00:22:16,706
观众爱你 因为他们知道你有多"无辜"
the public loves you because they know how innocent you are.

311
00:22:16,706 --> 00:22:17,915
那倒是
That's true.

312
00:22:17,957 --> 00:22:21,169
我去看看嗯嗯啊啊要不要娶你 你确定他是孩子的爹吗?
Let me see if Arne is open to matrimony. You're sure he's the father?

313
00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:24,172
是啊 我肯定是 非常
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely. He's the father, yes.

314
00:22:24,756 --> 00:22:26,257
算相当确定吧
Pretty sure.

315
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:28,926
喂 马西 把我的鱼尾巴拿来!
Hey, Maxie, bring me my ass back!

316
00:22:28,968 --> 00:22:31,054
嘿 嘿 伙计 过来
Hey, hey. Buddy, come here.

317
00:22:40,938 --> 00:22:44,400
首都影业公司
CAPITOL PICTURES STUDIOS

318
00:22:45,568 --> 00:22:47,945

- How ya doing, Hobie? - Hello there, Scotty.

319
00:22:47,987 --> 00:22:49,822
他们让你来摄影棚拍戏啊?
They got you shooting on the lot?

320
00:22:49,822 --> 00:22:54,619
曼尼斯把我从西部片场调回来 说要让我演部歌舞剧
Well, Mr. Mannix, pulled me off the Western, says I'm doing a movie on a sound stage.

321
00:22:54,619 --> 00:22:57,705
还弄了间专属化妆室说
They built a drawing room.

322
00:23:31,781 --> 00:23:33,074
他来了 罗伦兹先生
He's here, Mr. Laurentz.

323
00:23:33,074 --> 00:23:34,409
Ah.

324
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:39,580
亲爱的 欢迎 我是罗伦斯罗伦兹
My dear boy, welcome. Laurence Laurentz.

325
00:23:39,622 --> 00:23:42,917
你看起来很棒喔 感觉怎样?
And you look wonderful, wonderful, how do you feel?

326
00:23:42,917 --> 00:23:45,878
这个嘛...领口有点给我紧 (本来就不是给你穿的)
Well, this here collar... collar is a little tight.

327
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,716
No no, no, it's nicely 铿t, looks a marvel, just takes a little getting used to.
不会不会 很合身 待会就习惯了

328
00:23:49,757 --> 00:23:53,136
霍比 现在我们要拍的就是这里
Now, Hobie. Here is our set.

329
00:23:53,136 --> 00:23:55,013
没错
And, in fact, that's right, yes.

330
00:23:55,054 --> 00:23:58,349
待会你就从那进场 从大厅门看到比夫的手提箱
You enter from there, having just seen Biff's valise in the foyer,

331
00:23:58,391 --> 00:24:02,103
虽然啊莱格声称他没来过
in spite of Allegra's claim that he hasn't been to the house.

332
00:24:02,145 --> 00:24:04,272
我超崇拜啊莱格    - 应该是的
- I'm sweet on Allegra. - Indeed you are.

333
00:24:04,314 --> 00:24:06,816
但我看到了比夫的手提箱    - 应该是的
- But I've seen Biff's grip. - Indeed you have.

334
00:24:06,816 --> 00:24:08,901
And so here we 铿nd you...
就在此时...

335
00:24:08,943 --> 00:24:11,821
Hobie, we 铿nd you haunted by unspoken suspicions.
霍比 你要表现出被猜疑所困

336
00:24:11,863 --> 00:24:13,823
被比夫的手把想困扰
Haunted. By Biffs grip.

337
00:24:13,823 --> 00:24:16,200
是他的手提箱 是的 但 但
By his valise, yes, but, but,

338
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,953
这位是狄德莉
here is Dierdre,

339
00:24:18,995 --> 00:24:22,457
她对你有好感 感觉机会来了
harboring deep feelings for you, and sensing opportunity.

340
00:24:22,498 --> 00:24:23,833
狄德莉     - 是狄德莉
- Dierdre. - Dierdre, yes.

341
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:29,339
她开始跟你勾勾狄 一起坐在沙发上开始讲话
So at her importuning, you join her on the couch, and conversation ensues.

342
00:24:31,716 --> 00:24:35,803
她会跟我勾勾狄吗 罗伦斯先生?    - 是罗伦兹
- So, she's-she's gonna importune, Mr. Laurence? - Laurentz.

343
00:24:35,845 --> 00:24:39,307
喔 不好意思 她打算跟我来一段吗 罗伦兹先生?
Oh, I'm sorry. She's gonna importune, Mr. Laurentz?

344
00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:41,267
我是不是该注意一下?
Is that something I should be concerned about?

345
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:42,810
她只会叫你过去和她坐一下 也就是过去然后开始讲话(不会吃了你)
She'll simply ask you to join her on the couch,

346
00:24:42,852 --> 00:24:44,854
is all I mean to say, and conversation ensues.

347
00:24:44,896 --> 00:24:45,980
好的 了解
Okay, I gotcha.

348
00:24:46,022 --> 00:24:47,732
很好  我们先过一次如何?
Very good, very good, let's try one shall we?

349
00:24:47,774 --> 00:24:51,069
好的 我试试    - 很好 太棒了
- Sure, I'll give her a go. - Wonderful. Splendid.

350
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:54,572
我得提醒一下...
The only thing I would suggest is...

351
00:24:54,864 --> 00:25:01,162
before your 铿rst line, you respond to her line with a mirthless chuckle.
你说第一句台词前 先低声笑一下

352
00:25:02,205 --> 00:25:03,498
低声笑一下
A mirthless chuckle.

353
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:07,043
是的 是因为你对啊莱格莫名的猜疑
Yes, I think given your unspoken suspicions about Allegra,

354
00:25:07,377 --> 00:25:09,587
低声笑一下
- A mirthless chuckle. - Uh-huh.

355
00:25:09,587 --> 00:25:12,215
好的罗伦斯先生 我会试试   - 是罗伦兹
- Okay, Mr. Laurence, I'll give it a shot. - Laurentz.

356
00:25:12,256 --> 00:25:16,886
喔 抱歉罗伦兹先生 我会试试
Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry, Mr. Laurentz. I'll give it a shot.

357
00:25:26,354 --> 00:25:29,607
MERRILY WE DANCE? 27A, Take 1
“欢乐岁月”第27幕 第一遍

358
00:25:31,317 --> 00:25:32,944
开拍
Action.

359
00:25:37,824 --> 00:25:41,494
喔 盲弟 过来沙发跟我坐
Oh, Monty. Come join me on the divan.

360
00:25:59,345 --> 00:26:02,682
看来啊莱格不来了 真无聊啊
It seems Allegra's a no show; which is simply a bore.

361
00:26:02,682 --> 00:26:04,976
但 我可以陪你打桥牌
But, I'll partner you in bridge.

362
00:26:05,727 --> 00:26:07,478
你干嘛摆臭脸?
Why the pout?

363
00:26:09,147 --> 00:26:12,108
要是这么简单就好啦
Would that it were so simple.

364
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:19,490
卡
And cut.

365
00:26:19,532 --> 00:26:21,909
停机
That's a cut.

366
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,580
很好 太棒了
Very good. Wonderful in fact.

367
00:26:25,621 --> 00:26:29,167
这次我们得做点小小改变
But let's try it a little differently this time.

368
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:31,419
好的    - 不如这样...
- Sure. - Let's try.

369
00:26:31,461 --> 00:26:35,214
Well, let's see, 铿rst of all why don't we dispense with the mirthless chuckle.
这样吧 先别低声笑了

370
00:26:35,256 --> 00:26:37,508
别低声笑    - 不 省省吧
- No mirthless chuckle. - No, no need, really.

371
00:26:37,508 --> 00:26:41,804
哪个猪头想的 是我指导无方 我错在想太多了
It was a bad idea, bad directorial, my fault, over thinking the thing.

372
00:26:41,804 --> 00:26:43,848
既然你这样说了 我很乐意再试一次 低声笑
Well if you say so, but I'm happy to do another,

373
00:26:43,848 --> 00:26:45,141
maybe try her one more time.

374
00:26:45,183 --> 00:26:47,602
如果你要我低声笑 我一定办得到
I mean if you want that chuckle I sure wanna give her to ya.

375
00:26:47,602 --> 00:26:49,854
不用了 到这地步就省省吧
No no no, completely unnecessary under the circumstances,

376
00:26:49,896 --> 00:26:52,565
观众应该会了解你的心声
I think the audience can to that extent they can read your thoughts,

377
00:26:52,607 --> 00:26:55,151
他们会感觉到你的悲伤
and they, they will assume your mirthlessness.

378
00:26:55,151 --> 00:26:58,196
好的 你说了算 罗伦斯先生    - 是罗伦兹
- Okay, you're the bossman, Mr. Laurence. - Laurentz.

379
00:26:58,237 --> 00:27:00,865
喔 天啊 抱歉 罗伦兹先生
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry, Mr. Laurentz.

380
00:27:00,907 --> 00:27:04,952
还有  这遍呢 试着看着狄德莉说话
Also, this time, let's try, actually looking at Dierdre as we speak,

381
00:27:04,994 --> 00:27:09,874
看着她的眼睛 略带悲伤说出台词
looking into her eyes, and speaking our line with a certain... ruefulness.

382
00:27:10,249 --> 00:27:14,003
悲伤喔 好的    - 这不难 明白吧?
- Ruefulness, okay. - Yes. Because it's not so simple, you see.

383
00:27:14,045 --> 00:27:17,423
不像她提议的那么简单
- Not so simple as she suggest. - Okay.

384
00:27:17,465 --> 00:27:20,510
知道吧...感情可没那么简单
And... Your feelings are not so simple.

385
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:22,845
知道 先生
No, sir. Okay.

386
00:27:23,596 --> 00:27:24,931
开机
Roll camera.

Oh, Monty. Come join me on the divan.

390
00:27:51,749 --> 00:27:54,877
看来啊莱格不来了 真无聊啊
It seems Allegra's a no show; which is simply a bore.

391
00:27:54,877 --> 00:27:58,798
但 我可以陪你打桥牌 你干嘛摆臭脸?
But, I'll partner you in bridge. Why the pout?

392
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:05,388
要是这么简单就好啦
Would that? It were so simple.

393
00:28:09,058 --> 00:28:10,727

Come. Come.

396
00:28:28,828 --> 00:28:30,705
好吧  不如这样
All right, let's try this,

397
00:28:30,747 --> 00:28:33,916
你的台词 像我这样说
your line, just say it as I say it,

398
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:35,960
你按照我说的方式说你的台词
say your line exactly as I'm about to.

399
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,172
照我这样说   - 好的
- Just as I'm about to do. - Sure, okay.

400
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:42,925

- Would that it'were so simple. - Would that it'wuuuhs so simple.

403
00:28:49,432 --> 00:28:51,893

孩子啊 你干嘛那样说? 怎会这样 “ㄏ....”?

404
00:28:51,893 --> 00:28:54,395

- Would that it twuuuuuuh, so simple. - Would that it'were so simple.

412
00:29:08,868 --> 00:29:11,287
要是...我还要尝试  罗伦兹先生
Would... I'm trying to say that, Mr. Laurentz.

413
00:29:11,329 --> 00:29:13,581

414
00:29:13,623 --> 00:29:17,001
我还以为...刚刚是罗伦兹说
I thought... a minute ago it was Laurentz.

415
00:29:17,001 --> 00:29:19,545
那好 我们就叫名字好了 叫我罗伦斯好了
No. We can use Christian names, my good dear boy, Laurence is fine.

416
00:29:19,587 --> 00:29:21,172
就像我叫你霍比?
- Just as I call you Hobie? - Okay.

417
00:29:21,214 --> 00:29:23,716
要是这么简单就好啦

要是这么简单就“ㄏ....”好啦 轻快点
Would that it twuuuuuuh, so simple. Trippingly.

421
00:29:29,138 --> 00:29:30,890

Don't say trippingly. Say the line trippingly.

422
00:29:30,932 --> 00:29:33,851
要是这么简单就“ㄏ....” 要是...要是...
Would that it twuuuuuuh... Would... Would...

要是这么简单就“ㄏ....”好啦 - 要是这么简单就好啦
- Would that it twuuuuuuh, so simple. - Would that it'were so simple.

00:29:44,404 --> 00:29:45,822
要是...   - 简单悲伤
- Would... - Rueful, simple.

428
00:29:45,822 --> 00:29:48,616
要是这么简单就“ㄏ....” - 带点悲伤
- Would that it twuuu... - Sorrowful simple.

429
00:29:48,658 --> 00:29:50,284
充满悲伤 你应该充满感情 悲伤的说
You can say sorrowful. Rueful. Sorrowful.

430
00:29:50,284 --> 00:29:52,286
要是这么简单就好啦 - 要是这么简单就“ㄏ....”
- Would that it'were so simple. - Would that it tw...

431
00:29:52,328 --> 00:29:54,038
要是这么简单就“ㄏ....” - 怎么会? 怎么会这样?
- Would that it twuuuuuuh, - Why? Why are you doing this?

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,291
要是这么简单就“ㄏ....”好啦 - 别乱动
- Would that it twuuuuuuh, so simple. - Keep still.

433
00:30:22,942 --> 00:30:25,778
停拍?! 要停多久? 你怎么跟导演说的?
Stall?! For how long? What do I tell the director?

434
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,323
我们还在努力找他 我不希望被狗仔知道
That we're looking for him. But we don't want it in the gossip columns.

435
00:30:28,364 --> 00:30:31,409
Baird on a bender or in a love nest or wherever we end up 铿nding him.
败德不是在花天酒地 就是在爱巢 最终我们还是会找到

436
00:30:31,451 --> 00:30:33,703
只要跟片场有关就不能停
As far as the set is concerned it's business as usual.

437
00:30:33,745 --> 00:30:37,040
Tell the A.D. Baird is out brie铿y with a high ankle sprain.
就跟助理导演说败德脚扭伤了暂停拍摄

438
00:30:37,081 --> 00:30:38,541
好 但没他怎么拍?
Fine, but what do we shoot without him?

439
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:40,460
我们下午才弄好火炉说
We got the brasier scene up this afternoon.

440
00:30:40,501 --> 00:30:44,297
可不可以先排没他的戏? 用他的替身查克
Could you get through it shooting around him? Maybe use his stunt double, Chunk Mulligan.

441
00:30:44,297 --> 00:30:45,798
查克不会演戏
Chunk can't act.

442
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,300
让编剧把他台词删掉一些
Get the writer to trim his speeches.

443
00:30:47,342 --> 00:30:50,261
Well maybe, but then what do we do? All we got left is the 铿nal scene.
然后怎么办?我们还有最后一幕没拍

444
00:30:50,303 --> 00:30:53,056
喔脱落糗死要在忏悔的小偷脚边讲话
Autolochus's speech at the feet of the penitent thief.

445
00:30:53,056 --> 00:30:55,683
那可是整部戏的高潮啊!
It's the emotional climax of the entire picture!

446
00:30:55,683 --> 00:30:59,354
我们要看到喔脱落糗死受到耶稣的感召!
We got to see Autolochus has absorbed the message of the Christ!

447
00:30:59,354 --> 00:31:02,231
我可以明白    - 我们需要败德的明星魅力
- Yeah, I can see that. - We need Baird's star power, his charisma.

448
00:31:02,273 --> 00:31:03,608
没错 他的情感... - 真挚感情!发自肺腑 整部戏的精随
Sure, his emotional...

449
00:31:03,608 --> 00:31:05,985
This can't be faked! It's the heart and soul of the picture!

450
00:31:05,985 --> 00:31:07,987
我了解    - 然后电影结束
- I understand. - End of the film,

451
00:31:08,029 --> 00:31:10,698
我们可不能随便让一个...
we can't just give that speech to some...

452
00:31:10,698 --> 00:31:13,743
某个...罗马蠢蛋
some... Roman schmoe.

453
00:31:13,785 --> 00:31:15,244
不 不 不 是 是 是 我了解
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it.

454
00:31:15,286 --> 00:31:18,039
但他的狂欢还有一两天
But his benders can last a day or two.

455
00:31:18,247 --> 00:31:20,416
停拍损失大吗?    - 太大了
- What does it cost to shut down? - Plenty.

456
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:23,544
可知这部戏阵容多大 可占用五跟十四号影棚
You know how big the picture is, we're on Stages 5 and 14,

457
00:31:23,586 --> 00:31:26,005
如果演到最后一幕
if we're carrying everybody in the final scene

458
00:31:26,047 --> 00:31:30,635
who's up on cruci铿xes that's 340 an hour hardship pay, 8 hour minimum.
一个小时要付340美元薪水 每天至少八小时

459
00:31:30,677 --> 00:31:32,011
是 是   - 再加上 还失去...
- Yeah. Yeah. - Plus, we lose...

460
00:31:32,053 --> 00:31:33,304
曼尼斯先生 对不起    - 现在没空
- Mr. Mannix, I'm sorry. - Not now.

461
00:31:33,304 --> 00:31:35,640
... 这周末跟福斯公司签约的陶德
... we lose Todd Hocheiser to Fox at the end of the week.

462
00:31:35,682 --> 00:31:37,517
我们本该签下来 谁知
Shoulda made him exclusive; who knew.

463
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:39,435
对不起 先生...    - 现在没空!
- Sorry, sir. It's... - Not now!

464
00:31:39,477 --> 00:31:42,063
是罗伦兹先生啦 我拦不住!
It's Mr. Laurentz, I can't stop him!

465
00:31:42,105 --> 00:31:44,232
曼尼斯 这样我没法搞!   - 不可以 不可以
- Mannix, I won't have it! - No, no.

466
00:31:44,232 --> 00:31:46,526
For two decades the words Laurence Laurentz presents"
二十年来 我这"罗伦兹"名号

467
00:31:46,567 --> 00:31:49,278
可是对观众意义重大!   - 没事了 娜塔莉
- has meant something to the public! - It's alright, Natalie.

468
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,072
好 瓦特有什么再跟我说
Okay, Walt, let me know.

469
00:31:51,114 --> 00:31:53,700
说说你的想法..罗伦斯?
What's on your mind, uh... Laurence?

470
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,285
霍比不会演戏!
Hobie Doyle cannot act!

471
00:31:56,327 --> 00:31:59,247
霍巴特道尔是电影巨星
Hobart Doyle is one of the biggest movie stars in the world.

472
00:31:59,288 --> 00:32:01,582
仅限于骑马! 但这是剧情片 曼尼斯
On horseback! But this is a drama, Mannix.

473
00:32:01,624 --> 00:32:04,377
真正的戏剧!还加上百老汇元素
A real drama, it's an adaptation of a Broadway smash!

474
00:32:04,377 --> 00:32:08,631
需要受过训练的专业演员 而不是会马术的小丑
It requires the skills of a trained thespian, not a rodeo clown.

475
00:32:08,673 --> 00:32:10,049
请你让兰特来演!
I begged you for Lunt!

476
00:32:10,091 --> 00:32:11,801
曼尼斯 很抱歉 但我得提醒你...
Mr. Mannix, I'm sorry, but, you wanted me to make sure

477
00:32:11,843 --> 00:32:14,178
不要错过皇家花园饭店的午餐 你还没跟我说要约谁
you didn't miss your lunch at the Imperial Gardens.

478
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,596
你一直没跟我说
You never told me who with.

479
00:32:15,638 --> 00:32:18,891
疯啦 谁会想看到兰特
Nuts. Look, no one wants to see Lunt.

480
00:32:18,933 --> 00:32:21,352
演员不再换了 这是深刻先生的决定
We're not recasting, this came from Mr. Schenk himself,

481
00:32:21,352 --> 00:32:23,771
就是用霍比 这孩子有兴趣吗?
it's Hobie Doyle. Is the boy game?

482
00:32:23,813 --> 00:32:25,815
喔 他可有兴趣了 还外行的很!
Oh, he's game. And gamey!

483
00:32:25,815 --> 00:32:27,942
如果他需要帮忙 你则无旁贷
Well, if he need help, it's your job to help him.

484
00:32:27,942 --> 00:32:30,069
我会去跟霍比谈谈 看看你们拍的片子
I'll have a talk with Hobie and take a look at what you've shot,

485
00:32:30,069 --> 00:32:33,156
现在呢 我得赶去跟人吃午餐
but right now, I've got a lunch.

486
00:32:40,705 --> 00:32:46,336
瑟斯提慕斯你说得很对
What truth to these mutterings, Sestimus.

487
00:33:09,525 --> 00:33:11,361
别吵 恩格斯
Quiet, Engels.

They mix a hell of a Mai Tai. I like this place.

492
00:33:31,464 --> 00:33:34,926
抱歉让你久等 这是个艰难的抉择
Sorry to keep you hanging, it's a tough decision.

493
00:33:34,926 --> 00:33:38,596
先别道歉 我们有一星期时间考虑
Nothing to apologize for, we said the deal was on the table for a week.

494
00:33:40,807 --> 00:33:42,183
来吧
Go ahead.

495
00:33:42,392 --> 00:33:45,561
不 我正在戒烟
Nah, I'm... I'm trying to quit.

496
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,271
我想看看能帮上什么忙
I just wanted to visit again to see if

497
00:33:47,271 --> 00:33:48,940
或者对我们建议还有什么不清楚的?
there was some impediment we could help with,

498
00:33:48,982 --> 00:33:50,650
or if something in the offer isn't clear?

499
00:33:50,692 --> 00:33:53,027
没有 很清楚 你们的建议很大方
The offer's very clear. And very generous.

500
00:33:53,069 --> 00:33:55,196
我们想让你能欣然接受
We want to make it easy for you to say yes.

501
00:33:55,238 --> 00:34:00,118
是这样 曼尼斯 我们需要一位 像你这样有才华的人来解决问题
Look Mannix, we need a guy with your talents in management, problem-solving.

502
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,328
你得好好为将来打算
And you need to think about the future.

503
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:04,247
洛克希德公司发展很快
Lockheed is booming.

504
00:34:04,288 --> 00:34:07,500
现在大家都坐飞机了 我们即将进军喷射客机市场
Everyone is riding in airplanes, and we're moving into jet airplanes.

505
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,711
新时代来了 曼尼斯 我们要当新时代的人
It's a new age, Mannix, and we're part of it;

506
00:34:10,128 --> 00:34:13,214
你现在所待的产业有啥未来可言?
the industry you're in, what's the future there?

507
00:34:13,214 --> 00:34:15,425
大家有电视看了谁还去看电影?
What happens when everybody owns a television set?

508
00:34:15,466 --> 00:34:17,593
还有人每个周末去看电影吗?
Will they still be going to pictures every week?

509
00:34:17,635 --> 00:34:20,430
我们认为是家庭...    - 我不是要说风凉话
- Well, we like to think that family... - I don't mean to denigrate.

510
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:23,308
电影业真的很有趣
I'm sure the picture business is pretty damned interesting.

511
00:34:23,349 --> 00:34:26,769
但也无足轻重 不是吗?
But it's also pretty frivolous, isn't it?

512
00:34:26,769 --> 00:34:30,189
航空业才是举足轻重的行业和人
Aviation is serious; serious business, serious people.

513
00:34:30,231 --> 00:34:33,818
You won't be babysitting a lot of oddballs and mis铿ts,
不需伺候那些怪咖

514
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,611
应付那么多棘手的难题
shouldering a lot of crackpot problems.

515
00:34:35,611 --> 00:34:37,447
是有些人不好伺候 但...
We have some kooks, sure, but...

516
00:34:37,488 --> 00:34:40,366
当然是些怪咖 都是装出来的
Of course they're kooks, it's all make-believe.

517
00:34:43,453 --> 00:34:46,581
我还跟自己说别贬低你的行业说
I told myself I wasn't gonna badmouth the competition, and look at me.

518
00:34:46,622 --> 00:34:49,542
不好意思 曼尼斯 来谈正事
Sorry, Mannix, I'll stick to what we're about.

519
00:34:49,542 --> 00:34:51,044
给你看个东西
Let me show you something.

520
00:34:51,085 --> 00:34:54,589
听过比基尼环礁吗?    - 没
- Ever heard of the Bikini atoll? - No.

521
00:34:55,131 --> 00:34:57,884
A test site, just a couple of rocks in the middle of the Paci铿c
这是我们的试验场 几星期前

522
00:34:57,925 --> 00:34:59,802
还只是太平洋中央的几块石头
until a few weeks ago.

523
00:34:59,802 --> 00:35:02,055
直到我们用上真家伙
When we blew the Aitch erino.

524
00:35:02,055 --> 00:35:04,057
或许我不该这么说
Shouldn't be telling you this.

525
00:35:04,891 --> 00:35:06,601
这才是真实的世界
It's the real world.

526
00:35:06,643 --> 00:35:08,478
氢弹
Hydrogen bomb.

527
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:10,730
核融合装置
Fusion device.

528
00:35:11,773 --> 00:35:15,109
末日大决战    - 当时就有洛克希德 正进行...
- Armageddon. - And Lockheed was there. We had a...

529
00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:17,403
曼尼斯先生 有您的电话
Call for you, Mr. Mannix.

530
00:35:17,654 --> 00:35:19,113
谢谢
Thank you.

531
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:23,701
喂    - 兜不拢先生收到绑架的电报
- Hello. - Mr. Dubrow has a telegram on a kidnapping.

532
00:35:23,743 --> 00:35:25,912
刚收到吗?    - 是的 要他拿去给你吗?
- He has it now? - Yes, he does. Shall he bring it to you?

533
00:35:25,912 --> 00:35:27,538
不用 叫他等我 我去找他
No, have him stay on the set, I'll go to him.

534
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,082
好 再见
Okay, good bye.

535
00:35:29,666 --> 00:35:31,668
不好意思 卡达西 有急事
Sorry, Cuddahy, work emergency.

536
00:35:31,709 --> 00:35:34,212
不管怎样 我还会在那工作
Still do work there, for the day anyway.

537
00:35:34,253 --> 00:35:37,048
你的话很有说服力 我想好跟你说
You make a good case. I'll let you know.

538
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:48,369
你是好莱坞来的吗?
You one of the Hollywood people?

539
00:36:51,205 --> 00:36:52,790
是吧
Maybe.

540
00:36:52,957 --> 00:36:55,043
他们在里面
They're in there.

541
00:37:23,696 --> 00:37:28,451
请进! 大家都欢迎你!
Please! Enter! All are welcome!

542
00:37:45,843 --> 00:37:47,178
Ah!

543
00:37:52,016 --> 00:37:54,143
那些东西很讨厌
Those things are a nuisance.

544
00:37:55,353 --> 00:37:57,188
谢谢
Thank you.

545
00:37:59,774 --> 00:38:02,652
待会要吃三明治
We'll have sandwiches in a minute.

546
00:38:03,027 --> 00:38:05,571
喝茶吗?    - 茶?
- Tea? - Tea?

547
00:38:06,489 --> 00:38:10,243
好啊
Uh. Okay. Yeah.

548
00:38:10,243 --> 00:38:13,621
那 这...    - 怎么回事吗?
- And, uh... - And what's going on?

549
00:38:13,663 --> 00:38:16,624
是啊    - 我们刚读完会议纪录
- Yeah. - Well, we've just read the minutes

550
00:38:16,666 --> 00:38:19,544
汤姆打算展开一个新业务
and Tom was about to bring up new business.

551
00:38:22,463 --> 00:38:24,549
我没听到会议纪录
I missed the minutes.

552
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:28,678
这没关系    - 不过是无聊的过程
- I wouldn't worry about it. - They're usually pretty boring.

553
00:38:34,309 --> 00:38:36,019
这开的是什么会啊?
What kind of a meeting is this?

554
00:38:36,019 --> 00:38:39,689
Well it's not a meeting,? so much as a, a...
其实也不是什么“会”不过是个...

555
00:38:39,731 --> 00:38:44,485
就是个...学术研究
It's a... more of a, a study group.

556
00:38:44,485 --> 00:38:46,237
你们研究啥?
And you're studying?

557
00:38:46,279 --> 00:38:47,739
所有愉快的事
Oh, all sorts of jolly stuff.

558
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,615
历史啊    - 经济啊
- History. - Economics.

559
00:38:49,657 --> 00:38:53,703
不都一样对吧? 历史 经济?
Same thing, isn't it? History, economics?

560
00:38:53,703 --> 00:38:55,663
你不觉得吗?
Don't you agree?

561
00:38:58,291 --> 00:39:00,585
这个...嘛...我也没...
Well. . . I'm. . . I'm not really

562
00:39:00,626 --> 00:39:03,338
念过历史
a student of history.

563
00:39:08,134 --> 00:39:09,135
别吵 恩格斯
Quiet, Engels.

564
00:39:09,177 --> 00:39:13,056
谢谢...人性已经分离了?
So...  Thank you. ... man is split?

565
00:39:13,097 --> 00:39:14,974
是人的功能分离了
Well, man's functions are split.

566
00:39:15,016 --> 00:39:18,269
那是小人物 一般老百姓为谋生而工作
There's the little guy, the regular Joe, who works for a living.

567
00:39:18,269 --> 00:39:21,022
他是肉体...是寄主
He's the body, uh. . body politic.

568
00:39:21,022 --> 00:39:23,608
大脑才是老板 主人...
Then there's the brain, the boss, the owner...

569
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:26,903
大脑不是老板!   - 不对! 寄生虫才是老板!
- The boss is not the brain! - No, no! The boss is parasite!

570
00:39:26,903 --> 00:39:30,156
老板的确不工作 但有他的功能
Well it's true that the boss doesn't work, but he has a function.

571
00:39:30,156 --> 00:39:32,033
他控制...
He controls the means of...

572
00:39:32,075 --> 00:39:35,119
生产 但那不是功能 那是...
...production, sure, but that's not a function, that's...

573
00:39:35,161 --> 00:39:37,080
寄生主义! 在肉体里!    - 闭嘴!
- Parasitism! On the body! - Shut up!

574
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:41,501
存在一般人体!是...
On the body politic! Of the regular Joe! It's...

575
00:39:46,714 --> 00:39:52,387
人是一个整体 一个简单的经济体
Man is oddity, a simple economic agent.

576
00:39:52,387 --> 00:39:58,893
人的基藤互为分离 互相矛盾 必须协调才能克服
Man's institutions are split, expressing contradictions that must be worked through.

577
00:39:58,893 --> 00:40:01,396
他们以互为因果
And they are worked through

578
00:40:01,437 --> 00:40:08,027
又可预见的方式协调配合 历史就是科学
in a causative, predictable way: history is science.

579
00:40:08,027 --> 00:40:11,531
这正是辩证法的精随
This is the essence of the dialectic.

580
00:40:11,531 --> 00:40:13,866
知道吗 如果你懂经济的话
You see, if you understand economics,

581
00:40:13,908 --> 00:40:16,703
就能把未来事都写下来
you can actually write down what will happen in the future,

582
00:40:16,744 --> 00:40:19,664
with as much con铿dence as you write down the history of the past.
就像写昨天的历史一样自信

583
00:40:19,706 --> 00:40:23,167
因为这是科学 不是迷信
Because it's science. It's not make believe.

584
00:40:23,167 --> 00:40:26,170
我们不相信圣诞老人
We don't believe in Santa Claus.

585
00:40:26,504 --> 00:40:28,047
Another 铿nger sandwich?
还要三明治吗?

586
00:40:28,089 --> 00:40:31,134
谢谢 如果理解没错的话...
Oh... thank you. But if I follow this correctly...

587
00:40:32,135 --> 00:40:33,886
这是哪位?
Who's that guy?

588
00:40:33,886 --> 00:40:39,017
帮我们拍照的史密特罗维基先生
Mr. Smitrovich takes pictures for our newsletter.

589
00:40:39,058 --> 00:40:42,729
我们对历史的理解
Our understanding of the true workings of history,

590
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:45,523
让我们从中获得权力的杠杆
give us access to the levers of power.

591
00:40:45,565 --> 00:40:50,403
例如说你的摄影棚纯粹就是资本主义运作的工具
Your studio, for instance, is a pure instrument of capitalism.

592
00:40:50,403 --> 00:40:55,325
正因如此 它又揭露了资本主义的矛盾
As such it expresses the contradictions of capitalism,

593
00:40:55,366 --> 00:41:01,080
and can be enlisted to 铿nance its own destruction.
最终导致自身的灭亡

594
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,707
多令人激动啊!
Which is exciting!

595
00:41:02,749 --> 00:41:06,169
这可能对一般老百姓很有帮助
It can be made to help the little guy, the regular Joe.

596
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,837
是肉体!    - 闭嘴!
- The body politic! - Shut up!

597
00:41:07,837 --> 00:41:10,632
虽然目的就是要剥削一般老百姓
Even though it's purpose is to exploit the little guy.

598
00:41:10,673 --> 00:41:13,384
还有肉体    - 你是支持一般老百姓的
- And the body politic. - You are for the little guy.

599
00:41:13,426 --> 00:41:15,553
支持反对都不重要
For the little guy, against, it doesn't matter,

600
00:41:15,553 --> 00:41:18,514
历史还是原来样子 我们知道它会是什么样
history will be what it will be, and we already know what it will be,

601
00:41:18,556 --> 00:41:20,892
但 没错 我们支持一般老百姓    - 你不是吗?
- but, yes, we're for the little guy. - Aren't you?

602
00:41:20,933 --> 00:41:23,561
闭嘴!    - 开玩笑吧?
- Shut up! - Are you joking?

603
00:41:23,603 --> 00:41:26,022
我 支持一般老百姓? 我当然支持一般老百姓!
Me, for the little guy? Of course I'm for the little guy!

604
00:41:26,064 --> 00:41:27,857
他是喜剧演员吗?
Is this guy a comedian?

605
00:41:30,652 --> 00:41:34,364
听着 我还是回去吧 摄影棚一定失序了
Listen. I better get back, the studio's got to be going nuts.

606
00:41:34,364 --> 00:41:38,618
能不能今天先告一段落 下次继续?
Can we cut it off now and pick it up right here at the next study session?

607
00:41:40,828 --> 00:41:44,749
好 知道吗
Okay, well, See.

608
00:41:46,834 --> 00:41:49,587
恐怕事情没那么简单
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

609
00:41:51,756 --> 00:41:57,845
就这样 败德会拉客终于明白自己被共产党抓来了
And so Baird Whitlock found himself in the hands of Communists.

610
00:41:57,845 --> 00:42:01,808
与此同时 离马里布浪花很远的地方
Meanwhile, far from the crashing surf of Malibu,

611
00:42:01,849 --> 00:42:06,062
艾迪离开与洛克希德公司代表的午餐
Eddie Mannix, torn from his lunch with the Lockheed man.

612
00:42:06,104 --> 00:42:09,273
赶回浩大的电影公司
hurries back to the vastness of Capitol Pictures,

613
00:42:09,273 --> 00:42:11,943
那里永不疲倦的机器不停的运转
whose tireless machinery clanks on,

614
00:42:11,985 --> 00:42:17,740
为世上虚弱的人们制作今年的梦想配额
producing this year's ration of dreams for all the weary peoples of the world.

615
00:42:17,782 --> 00:42:20,034
Hey, numbskull, didn't you see the Rolling?light was on.
猪头 你没看到"拍摄中"的灯号吗

616
00:42:20,076 --> 00:42:23,204
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Mannix. Can I help you 铿nd someone?
喔 抱歉 曼尼斯先生你找谁?

617
00:42:23,246 --> 00:42:24,455
不用
No.

618
00:42:24,622 --> 00:42:26,791
喔脱落糗死    - 怎么了?
- Autolochus. - Yeah?

619
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:30,378
你为何穿着简陋出现在我的房间?
Why do you present yourself in my chambers in such humble fashion?

620
00:42:30,378 --> 00:42:32,797
别看我 乌苏莉娜
Do not look upon me, Ursulina.

621
00:42:32,839 --> 00:42:36,801
The 铿res of the brasier of Sestimus have latterly burned my face!
瑟斯提慕斯火炉熊熊火焰烧毁了我的脸!

622
00:42:36,801 --> 00:42:40,555
虽然阿基米德的药膏能让我快速复原
Though the unguents of Arkimideus promise shortly to undo the damage.

623
00:42:40,555 --> 00:42:44,058
喔脱落糗死 你知道我爱的是你的心
Autolochus, you knew that my love is for you,

624
00:42:44,058 --> 00:42:45,685
不是你的外表
not for your station.

625
00:42:45,727 --> 00:42:49,939
我对你的热情... .
And my ardor for you is yet as warm as the embersh of thish bras...

626
00:42:49,939 --> 00:42:53,901
灰烬...对不起 知道吗 对不起 (明星在我们手上 准备十万 听候指示)
this... this ember... I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know, I'm sorry.

627
00:42:57,113 --> 00:42:59,741
"我们就是未来"
"We are the future."

628
00:42:59,782 --> 00:43:02,785
什么意思?    - 我哪知
- What does that mean? - Beats me.

629
00:43:02,827 --> 00:43:06,122
早上不知谁把这张纸塞进我门缝
Somebody slipped it under my door some time after we broke this morning.

630
00:43:06,164 --> 00:43:08,374
跟谁提起吗?    - 没
- You mention it to anyone? - Nope.

631
00:43:08,416 --> 00:43:10,960
好 我们先别露声色
Okay, Walt, let's keep it that way.

632
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:16,341
对了 还有 查克演得不错
Hey, by the way. Chunk sounded good in there.

633
00:43:16,382 --> 00:43:17,925
艾迪 曼尼斯 制片总监
EDWARD MANNIX HEAD OF PHYSICAL PRODUCTION

634
00:43:17,967 --> 00:43:21,220
娜塔莉 可以帮我接会计部的史图吗?
Natalie, could you please get me Stu Schwartz, Accounting?

635
00:43:22,722 --> 00:43:24,891
史图在二线
Stu Schwartz on two.

636
00:43:25,266 --> 00:43:26,392
史图 你好吗?    - 好啊 艾迪
- Stu, how are you? - Good, Eddie.

637
00:43:26,434 --> 00:43:28,144
我要小额现金
- I need some petty cash. - Okay.

638
00:43:28,144 --> 00:43:29,729
十万    - 十万?
- A hundred thousand. - A hundred thousand?

639
00:43:29,771 --> 00:43:31,439
- I'm sorry, did I say petty? - You did.
抱歉 我有说“小额”?    - 有说

640
00:43:31,439 --> 00:43:33,316
说来话长 以后再跟你说
Well, it's a long story and I'll tell it to you sometime.

641
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:35,360
- You have that much in the of铿ce? - Yeah.
那里有那么多吗?    - 有

642
00:43:35,401 --> 00:43:37,654
要多大箱子装?
How much space will that take up?

643
00:43:37,904 --> 00:43:40,239
曼尼斯先生    - 好的 应该可以
- Mr. Mannix. - Okay, this might do it.

644
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:44,744
朵拉来了 问你有没有空?
Uh. Thora Thacker just came in, wonders if you have a moment?

645
00:43:44,994 --> 00:43:46,871
朵拉啊
Thora Thacker.

646
00:43:46,913 --> 00:43:50,917
跟她说我电话中 我从阳台走
Tell her I'm stuck on a call. I'll leave through the patio.

647
00:43:52,418 --> 00:43:54,337
没讲多久嘛
Call didn't take so long, then.

648
00:43:54,379 --> 00:43:57,882
是啊 不是 我直说吧 有事吗 朵拉?
Yes... no. Fast talkers. What can I do for you, Thora?

649
00:43:57,924 --> 00:44:01,177
那我也直说 只是出于礼貌通知你一声
Well, I'll be fast too. I only wanted to notify you as a courtesy

650
00:44:01,219 --> 00:44:03,721
我要刊登败德会拉客的事
that I'm running my very Whitlock story.

651
00:44:03,721 --> 00:44:05,014
是喔?什么故事?
Yeah? What's the story?

652
00:44:05,056 --> 00:44:08,309
就那事啊 我有可靠来源 我想让它见报
The story. I have a credible source and I'm going to run it,

653
00:44:08,351 --> 00:44:10,228
你知道我说的是啥事
and I think you know what story I mean.

654
00:44:10,269 --> 00:44:12,105
我哪知 败德会有什么事
I have no idea. There's nothing going on With Baird.

655
00:44:12,105 --> 00:44:14,857
有的话我怎会不知道?    - 艾迪别装了
- I would know, wouldn't I? - Don't play dumb, Eddie.

656
00:44:14,857 --> 00:44:17,026
我说的是...
I'm talking about...

657
00:44:17,026 --> 00:44:19,904
On Wings as Eagles.?
“长翅如鹰”的事

658
00:44:21,406 --> 00:44:24,492
虾米?    - 明天上报
- What? - Running it tomorrow.

659
00:44:24,534 --> 00:44:26,285
首先
First of all.

660
00:44:27,036 --> 00:44:28,788
首先 那事没有看点
First of all, there's nothing to that story.

661
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:31,374
I've heard it, it's been around forever, and it's never been con铿rmed.
剧本我看过了 大家都看过了 没人要

662
00:44:31,416 --> 00:44:33,042
再来 你不可能刊登
And secondly, you can't print that.

663
00:44:33,084 --> 00:44:34,752
就算可以 你也不会灯
Even if you could print it, you couldn't print it.

664
00:44:34,794 --> 00:44:36,421
你不会 你没那么低劣
And you wouldn't want to. Thora, it's beneath you.

665
00:44:36,421 --> 00:44:37,880
我就是那么低劣
The facts are never beneath me.

666
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,383
大家不想看到事实 只想盲从
People don't want the facts, they want to believe.

667
00:44:40,425 --> 00:44:42,802
我们产业就是那样 我的你的都是一样
That's our great industry, mine and yours too.

668
00:44:42,844 --> 00:44:46,055
大家相信败德会拉客是大明星 是个好人
They want to believe that Baird Whitlock is a great star, and a good man.

669
00:44:46,097 --> 00:44:48,057
你承认他不是    - 不 我说他是
- You're admitting he isn't. - No. I'm saying he is,

670
00:44:48,099 --> 00:44:51,477
虽然内容空洞 也没料可暴
though it's beside the point. There's nothing to it, nothing to the gossip.

671
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:54,772
我又不是狗仔!    - 不 不 不 当然不是
- I AM NOT A GOSSIP COLUMNIST! - No, no, no. Of course not.

672
00:44:54,814 --> 00:44:56,774
别把我跟我妹混为一谈!
Don't confuse me with my sister!

673
00:44:56,774 --> 00:44:58,359
不会啦...
Hardly. But look...

674
00:44:58,359 --> 00:45:01,112
明天你一定要登吗?   - 我一整篇专栏
- Do you have to run it tomorrow? - It's my entire column.

675
00:45:01,112 --> 00:45:04,490
我想跟败德谈谈 只能安排下午了
I'm happy to talk to Baird for comment, but it'll have to be this afternoon.

676
00:45:04,532 --> 00:45:07,243
败德现不在 改天吧
Baird is unavailable right now. Wait one day.

677
00:45:07,285 --> 00:45:10,580
朵拉 就等一天 明天我给你的专栏一个真实故事
Thora, wait one day and I'll give you a true story for tomorrow's column.

678
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:13,875
是关于...霍比的故事
A little something... about Hobie Doyle.

679
00:45:13,916 --> 00:45:16,794
我的读者才不鸟霍比 他只会骑马
My readers don't care about Hobie Doyle. He wears chaps.

680
00:45:16,836 --> 00:45:19,297
读者喜欢卡洛塔吗? 两人关系暧昧
Do they care about Carlotta Valdez? They're sweet on each other.

681
00:45:19,297 --> 00:45:21,549
你真得看看他们 形影不离
You should see the two of them together, like peas in a pod.

682
00:45:21,591 --> 00:45:24,594
想用这个换掉关乎我事业的故事?
Trade the story of my career for a puff piece on Hobie Doyle?

683
00:45:24,636 --> 00:45:26,429
不干   - 不是交换
- I don't think so. - You're not trading anything,

684
00:45:26,471 --> 00:45:28,723
只要你等一天 就能得到一个多年的故事
you're waiting one day on a story that's years old.

685
00:45:28,765 --> 00:45:31,768
等一天 你就可以访问败德 让你明白你的故事多乏味
Wait one day, I can let you talk to Baird and show you your story's the bunk,

686
00:45:31,809 --> 00:45:34,354
如果我说错了 也不影响你写的专栏
and if I'm wrong no skin off your nose, you run the column.

687
00:45:34,354 --> 00:45:38,316
同时 你还得到一个独家新闻 没人知道霍比跟卡洛塔的事
In the meantime you have an exclusive, no one else knows about Hobie and Carlotta.

688
00:45:38,358 --> 00:45:40,526
说好了 就酱
No kidding. You're it.

689
00:45:40,526 --> 00:45:42,528
到底朵拉是什么样的名字啊?
What kind of name is Thora, anyway?

690
00:45:42,528 --> 00:45:45,239
这是一千九百万读者信赖的名字
It's a name that 19 million readers trust.

691
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:46,783
别耍他们
Don't play games with them, Eddie.

692
00:45:46,824 --> 00:45:49,369
喔 没人要耍
Oh, no body's playing games here.

693
00:45:52,789 --> 00:45:54,832
这够大吗?
Is that big enough?

694
00:45:57,418 --> 00:46:01,714
哈罗 艾迪 出于礼貌通知你一声 明天我就要让故事上报
Hello Eddie, I'm notifying you as a courtesy before I run tomorrow's story.

695
00:46:01,756 --> 00:46:05,051
特色莉 我刚才见过你的...算了
Thessaly, I just saw your... never mind.

696
00:46:05,051 --> 00:46:07,470
你好吗? 什么故事?  - 败德的故事
- How're you doing? What's the story? - It's about Baird Whitlock.

697
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:09,889
相信我 那是老掉牙的事了 没啥好登的!
There is absolutely no truth to that old story, believe me!

698
00:46:09,889 --> 00:46:11,015
老掉牙?   - 老掉牙 毫无新意
- Old ? - Old. Stale. Rotten.

699
00:46:11,015 --> 00:46:13,142
我说的是今天的事
I'm talking about today.

700
00:46:13,393 --> 00:46:14,435
什么?
What?

701
00:46:14,477 --> 00:46:17,105
有小道消息说他今天从片场消失了
A little bird told me that he disappeared from the set today.

702
00:46:17,146 --> 00:46:20,692
喔 那个喔 不 不 是的 他该休息一下了
Oh! That. No, no, yes, he did have to take a break.

703
00:46:20,733 --> 00:46:23,277
受了点小伤 脚扭到了    - 你以为我在说啥?
- Minor injury, high ankle sprain. - What did you think I meant?

704
00:46:23,319 --> 00:46:25,113
没什么 我刚见到你姊了
No, nothing. I saw your sister earlier,

705
00:46:25,154 --> 00:46:27,448
她想重刊以前的八卦
she was trying to resurrect some old gossip about Baird.

706
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:29,409
喔 她就是这样 这老女人
Oh, I'm sure she was. That cow.

707
00:46:29,409 --> 00:46:31,995
对什么都后知后觉
She wouldn't know a news story if it bit her on the posterior.

708
00:46:32,036 --> 00:46:33,746
是啊 她就是...    - 脚扭到了?
- Yeah. Well, she's... - High ankle sprain?

709
00:46:33,746 --> 00:46:35,540
你就只会编这种藉口?
Is that really the best you could come up with?

710
00:46:35,581 --> 00:46:37,458
谁不知他的花边故事
We all know about the womanizing

711
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,752
还有酗酒的故事
and the drinking jags and the trips to San Berdoo.

712
00:46:39,752 --> 00:46:43,131
败德是个好人 只是脚扭到了
Baird is a good family man. He has a high ankle sprain.

713
00:46:43,172 --> 00:46:44,882
曼尼斯先生!
Mr. Mannix!

714
00:46:44,924 --> 00:46:48,177
- What's up, Peanut? - Natalie told me to 铿nd you PDQ.
怎么啦 小花生?   - 娜塔莉要我尽快找到你

715
00:46:48,219 --> 00:46:50,972
我知道这听来诡异 她说有人从未来打电话来
I know it sounds screwy, but she said someone's calling from the Future.

716
00:46:51,014 --> 00:46:53,808
未来...天啊!特色莉 我得赶回去
The futh... Good lord. Thessaly, I have to run.

717
00:46:53,808 --> 00:46:56,477
如果知道败德在哪 让我访问他
If you do know where Baird is, you must let me talk to him.

718
00:46:56,477 --> 00:46:59,939
当然 我马上就会知道他在哪 特色莉 一定...
Sure, I'll find out where he is, right away, Thessaly, and I'm sure...

719
00:46:59,981 --> 00:47:01,691
特色莉是什么样名字啊?
Say, what kind of name is Thessaly, anyway?

720
00:47:01,733 --> 00:47:05,778
这是两千万读者信赖的名字 他们要真相 艾迪
It's a name that 20 million readers trust. They want the truth, Eddie.

721
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,947
真相  是喔
The Truth. Yes.

722
00:47:08,614 --> 00:47:10,783
会给他们真相的
We're going to give it to them.

723
00:47:12,201 --> 00:47:15,163
在三线 霍比在里面    - 好
- On 3. And Hobie Doyle is in there. - Right.

724
00:47:15,163 --> 00:47:17,707
曼尼斯先生你好    - 谢谢你过来
- Hello, Mr. Mannix. - Thanks for coming, Hobie.

725
00:47:17,749 --> 00:47:19,334
等一下
One second.

726
00:47:20,126 --> 00:47:21,711
哈罗 曼尼斯...
Hello, Mannix...

727
00:47:22,003 --> 00:47:23,713
可恶
Damn.

728
00:47:23,755 --> 00:47:25,673
挂了 娜塔莉 再打来马上跟我说
Hung up, Natalie. Tell me the second they call back.

729
00:47:25,673 --> 00:47:27,050
是
Yes, sir.

730
00:47:27,091 --> 00:47:30,345
怎么回事 曼尼斯先生? 你好像在等什么
What's going on there, Mr. Mannix? Looks like you're expecting rain.

731
00:47:30,386 --> 00:47:32,138
没...什么
Nah, it's... nothing.

732
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:35,224
How's the 铿rst day on the picture? Getting comfortable?
第一天拍得怎样?还适应吗?

733
00:47:35,224 --> 00:47:37,435
喔 我觉得还不错
Oh, I guess it's going pretty good,

734
00:47:37,477 --> 00:47:39,479
那个 ...罗伦兹先生
that Mr. uh... Laurentz,

735
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,106
真是个大好人 一直在教我
he's an awful good man, he's helping me get through it,

736
00:47:42,148 --> 00:47:45,860
所有功劳都要归他 毕竟我还是个新人
I give him all the credit in the world, me the new hand in the bunkhouse,

737
00:47:45,902 --> 00:47:48,821
让我说好多台词 这得...
they got me talking a lot which takes a little...

738
00:47:48,821 --> 00:47:52,659
花时间适应 对着摄影机说话我还蛮喜欢的
getting use to,  talking with the camera looking at me but heck I enjoy.

739
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,868
好 很好
Oh, good, that's fine.

740
00:47:53,868 --> 00:47:57,080
Usually on a picture I just say Whitey!?or Whoa, there,?
以前在片里只跟马说"白驹!"或"喂 等等"

741
00:47:57,121 --> 00:47:59,957
但在这终于可以
but, this-here it's talking,

742
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:02,752
and it's people listening, that threw me little at 铿rst
第一次跟人说话 还真不习惯

743
00:48:02,794 --> 00:48:05,171
但我渐渐习惯了
but I think I got my leg up onner now.

744
00:48:05,213 --> 00:48:08,257
That's 铿ne. Laurence came in this morning to tell me how well you're doing.
罗伦兹早上还夸赞你的表现不错呢

745
00:48:08,299 --> 00:48:09,968
继续听他的话
You just continue to do whatever he says.

746
00:48:09,968 --> 00:48:11,803
他知道怎么拍好电影
He knows how to make a quality picture.

747
00:48:11,844 --> 00:48:15,848
的确 他的要求是尽善尽美
That is true, he will not quit on a take until it has quality.

748
00:48:16,099 --> 00:48:17,350
打来了吗?
Is that them?

749
00:48:17,392 --> 00:48:21,396
抱歉 先生 不是 曼尼斯太太在一线要接吗?
Sorry sir, no, do you want Mrs. Mannix on 1?

750
00:48:24,816 --> 00:48:26,150
嗨 亲爱的
- Hi, hon. - Hi.

751
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:27,902
你知道的啊 我就是忙
Oh, you know, busy.

752
00:48:28,569 --> 00:48:29,904
Uh-huh.

753
00:48:30,822 --> 00:48:32,115
Uh-huh.

754
00:48:33,449 --> 00:48:36,160
I thought he asked to play in铿eld.
我以为他要守野说

755
00:48:37,078 --> 00:48:38,454
知道了
I see.

Bob Stack would come up sometimes, the Blue Grotto was still open.

885
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:51,466
大伟那时是个开公车的
Dave Chasen was a busboy.

886
00:57:51,799 --> 00:57:53,926
这地方不错喔!你的吗?
Quite a place! Yours?

887
00:57:53,926 --> 00:57:55,219
当然不是
Oh, gracious no.

888
00:57:55,261 --> 00:57:58,473
我们一个成员的 今天下午刚好没来
It belongs to a member of our study group. He couldn't be here this afternoon

889
00:57:58,514 --> 00:58:00,058
没看到你会难过的
He'll be sad to have missed you.

890
00:58:00,099 --> 00:58:02,185
他是你的粉丝    - 太好了
- He's a fan. - Uh-huh. That's swell.

891
00:58:02,185 --> 00:58:05,772
我昏过去了 在这醒来
So, I black out, I wake up here

892
00:58:06,564 --> 00:58:08,566
跟自己说
and I say to myself,

893
00:58:08,608 --> 00:58:11,527
败德 你不能再干这种傻事了
Baird, you got to stop doing this,

894
00:58:12,195 --> 00:58:16,115
但你却说我算是被绑来的
but you're saying, actually, technically I was kidnapped.

895
00:58:16,115 --> 00:58:18,743
这个么...技术上是的
Well... technically, yes.

896
00:58:18,785 --> 00:58:21,412
- And there's gonna be a ransom. - I'd hardly call it a ransom.?
会有赎金吗    - 我不太想说成"赎金"

897
00:58:21,412 --> 00:58:26,167
Benedict there, that's Benedict de Bonaventure, he wrote The House of Ahasuaris.?
这位是班尼特 "雅哈随卤之家"的作者 超轰动的一部片

898
00:58:26,167 --> 00:58:29,879
帮电影公司赚了大把钞票
Enormous hit. Made the studio millions of dollars.

899
00:58:29,921 --> 00:58:32,382
班 你有分到吗?
Did you see any of those millions of dollars, Ben?

900
00:58:32,423 --> 00:58:33,758
没
I did not.

901
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:37,929
Dutch over there, Dutch Zweistrong wrote All The Way To Uruguay?
那位是道奇 "直到乌拉圭"的作者

902
00:58:37,971 --> 00:58:39,973
I wrote all the All The Way?pictures.
一系列"直到乌拉圭"剧本都是我写的

903
00:58:40,014 --> 00:58:43,226
All successful. You see any of the pro铿ts, Dutch?
都很轰动 你有分到利润吗?

904
00:58:43,226 --> 00:58:46,604
这里都是些编剧
- HA! - All of us here are writers.

905
00:58:46,646 --> 00:58:49,607
电影都是来自我们的巧思妙想
The pictures originated with us, they're our ideas,

906
00:58:49,649 --> 00:58:52,026
但版权却为电影公司所有
but they're owned by the studio.

907
00:58:52,068 --> 00:58:58,116
我不是说只有编剧被剥削 你看看自己 败德
I'm not saying only writers are being exploited, I mean, look at yourself, Baird.

908
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:01,661
知道吗  公司对我还不薄
Oh, you know, the studio takes pretty good care of me.

909
00:59:01,703 --> 00:59:03,162
你是啥  小朋友吗?
What're you, a child?

910
00:59:03,162 --> 00:59:06,582
I think what Herschel's trying to say is?
我想贺歇尔的意思是

911
00:59:06,582 --> 00:59:09,919
虽然电影公司拥有拍片的方法
just because the studio owns the means of production,

912
00:59:09,961 --> 00:59:14,340
但凭什么就能拿走所有的钱...我们的钱
Why should it be able to take the money... our money,

913
00:59:14,382 --> 00:59:18,761
我们辛劳创造的价值 让他们随随便便就打发掉?
the value created by our labor, and dole out what it pleases?

914
00:59:18,761 --> 00:59:23,599
That's not right. So, no. No, I wouldn't call it ransom.?
这哪对啊 所以呢  这应该不叫"赎金"

915
00:59:23,641 --> 00:59:25,059
叫补偿   - 没错.
- Payback. - That's right.

916
00:59:25,101 --> 00:59:29,897
直到最近我们研究小组呢 开始努力一件事
Now, until quite recently our study group had a narrow focus.

917
00:59:29,939 --> 00:59:33,651
我们要全力在剧本中加入共产主义的元素
We concentrated on getting communist content into motion pictures.

918
00:59:33,693 --> 00:59:35,987
当然 做得神不知鬼不觉
Always in a sub Rosa way, of course.

919
00:59:35,987 --> 00:59:38,448
做得还很成功
And we've been pretty darn successful.

920
00:59:38,489 --> 00:59:41,367
You remember, in Kerner's Corner? the Town Hall scene,
还记得"科纳的角落"里 市政府那一幕

921
00:59:41,409 --> 00:59:46,080
市议员逆转选举 让嘉斯当上市长?
where the aldermen overturn the rotten election and make Gus the mayor?

922
00:59:46,414 --> 00:59:47,874
没错
Yeah.

923
00:59:47,915 --> 00:59:51,085
我想我们转变了一些人的思想
I like to think we've changed a few minds.

924
00:59:51,085 --> 00:59:53,004
可是...
But, then. Well.

925
00:59:53,046 --> 00:59:56,424
来自史丹佛的马丘斯博士加入我们
Then Dr. Marcuse came down from Stanford, joined the study group.

926
00:59:56,466 --> 01:00:00,428
教我们直接采取行动
And started teaching us about direct action.

927
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:02,138
实践   - 行动
- Praxis. - Action.

928
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:07,268
我们每个人...都在追求自己的经济利益
We each pursue our own economic interest,

929
01:00:07,310 --> 01:00:10,897
我们不能超越历史的规律
we ourselves are not above the laws of history.

930
01:00:10,938 --> 01:00:15,318
但在凭藉能力追求利益的同时
But in pursuing our interest with vigor,

931
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:18,613
我们却加速了对立
we accelerate the dialectic,

932
01:00:18,613 --> 01:00:23,743
加速人类历史的终结并创造了新人类
and hasten the end of history and the creation of the New Man.

933
01:00:23,743 --> 01:00:25,745
此外 还赚到了钱    - 闭嘴!
- Plus, we make a little dough. - Shut up !

934
01:00:25,787 --> 01:00:29,958
我们讲的不是钱 是经济
We're not even talking about money, we're talking about economics.

935
01:00:29,999 --> 01:00:32,502
是喔
Sure. Good.

936
01:00:32,543 --> 01:00:34,420
说得好
Good stuff.

937
01:00:34,462 --> 01:00:38,049
那...这样说来...我能分到赎金吗?
So... now, do I get a... share of the ransom?

938
01:00:38,091 --> 01:00:39,425
不
Well,

939
01:00:39,425 --> 01:00:43,930
会拉客先生  被绑人基本上是分不到赎金的
no, Mr. Whitlock. You could hardly share in your own ransom.

940
01:00:43,972 --> 01:00:45,431
那很不道德
That would be unethical.

941
01:00:45,473 --> 01:00:47,892
各位 我觉得那很不公平!
Well, it doesn't seem fair, fellas!

942
01:00:47,892 --> 01:00:51,062
我是说 这场戏若没我的配合哪成
I mean, the whole set-up only works if I play along, right,

943
01:00:51,104 --> 01:00:54,148
若我不说谁绑了我?
if I don't let on that I know who kidnapped me?

944
01:00:54,148 --> 01:00:56,025
没错啊
Yes, that's right.

945
01:00:56,067 --> 01:00:58,444
如果我说出名字呢?
What if I named names?

946
01:00:58,486 --> 01:01:03,199
如果...我...说出真相呢?
Mmm. If I... Just I... tell the truth?

947
01:01:05,618 --> 01:01:09,664
我想你不会 会拉客先生
I don't think you'll do that, Mr. Whitlock.

948
01:01:09,706 --> 01:01:13,501
如果我们说出...
What if we told the truth about...

949
01:01:13,501 --> 01:01:16,504
On Wings as Eagles?
"长翅如鹰"的真相呢?

950
01:01:21,217 --> 01:01:22,719
希德
Sid.

951
01:01:24,137 --> 01:01:26,472
得帮迪安娜想想办法
we have to work something out for DeeAnna Moran.

952
01:01:26,472 --> 01:01:28,641
她又嫁了吗?    - 不是 她有了
- She get married again? - No, that's the problem.

953
01:01:28,683 --> 01:01:31,269
未婚生子    - 不好办
- Having a child, not married. - Tough.

954
01:01:31,311 --> 01:01:32,729
是喔 还没爹呢
Yeah. No father.

955
01:01:32,729 --> 01:01:34,480
当然某处有个爹...
Well, of course there is one, somewhere. . .

956
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:37,066
但天知道    - 对啊...所以呢可否 ...
- But who knows. - Exactly. So, is there any way,

957
01:01:37,108 --> 01:01:38,985
只是个提议
I'm just spitballing here,

958
01:01:39,027 --> 01:01:42,822
她是否可以领养自己的孩子?
any way she could adopt her own child?

959
01:01:44,866 --> 01:01:47,035
有趣喔    - 单亲...
- Interesting. - As a single...

960
01:01:47,076 --> 01:01:49,329
让她消失一阵 再回来
- She disappears for a while, reappears. - Uh-huh.

961
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:51,748
跟大家分享领养孩子的喜悦
And she wants to share her blessings, adopt a child.

962
01:01:51,789 --> 01:01:55,168
可以..她一直渴望做妈妈
Sure, she's always... yearned to be a mother.

963
01:01:55,209 --> 01:01:57,295
就是这样    - 我觉得有何不可
- That's it. - Well I don't see why not.

964
01:01:57,337 --> 01:02:01,591
加州法律没禁止父母领养自己的孩子
Nothing in California statute prohibits adoption by one's own parent.

965
01:02:01,633 --> 01:02:03,885
这可是创举 严格来讲 她必须
This is new ground. Technically, she'd have to

966
01:02:03,926 --> 01:02:06,638
先把孩子送给第三者
give up the baby to a third party.

967
01:02:06,638 --> 01:02:10,308
乔苏丽文    - 乔苏丽文 没错
- Joe Silverman. - Joe Silverman. Exactly.

968
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:12,685
让他当几天养父
He's the foster father, for a few days.

969
01:02:12,727 --> 01:02:16,189
再把孩子还给她
She hands the kid to Joe, he hands it back.

970
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:18,441
我来研究一下    - 好的
- I'll do some research. - Alright.

971
01:02:18,441 --> 01:02:21,903
曼尼斯先生 五点半了   - 真令人兴奋
- Mr. Mannix, it's 5:30. - This is exciting.

972
01:02:21,944 --> 01:02:23,905
...问过所有副导演了
... and asked all the assistant directors.

973
01:02:23,905 --> 01:02:25,531
其中一个说有个临时演员
One of them said that an extra

974
01:02:25,573 --> 01:02:28,576
在瑟斯提慕斯院子里鬼鬼祟祟的
in the courtyard of Sestimus-Aniydias scene seemed jumpy.

975
01:02:28,618 --> 01:02:31,412
好 把那个临时演员的名字跟瓦特说 让瓦特逼他
All right, get Walt the name of the extra so he can bring him in and sweat him.

976
01:02:31,412 --> 01:02:33,122
跟他说 如果说出败德在哪
Walt should tell him we won't press charges

977
01:02:33,122 --> 01:02:35,041
就不告他    - 明白
- if he tells us where Baird's been taken. - Check.

978
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:37,251
如果他装傻 或那副导搞错了
If he plays dumb, or if the A.D.'s wrong and he is dumb,

979
01:02:37,251 --> 01:02:38,753
...再找其他临时演员    - 明白
- ...check the other extras - Check.

980
01:02:38,795 --> 01:02:42,757
特色莉打来说你答应她今天采访败德
Thessaly Thacker called, said you promised her an interview with Baird today.

981
01:02:42,757 --> 01:02:45,385
更正一下 是朵拉   - 不 那是特色莉
- Check that, it was Thora Thacker. - No, it was Thessaly.

982
01:02:45,385 --> 01:02:47,136
跟她说 他去看医生了
Tell her, he was at the doctor longer than expected,

983
01:02:47,178 --> 01:02:49,013
明早在片场可以见到他
she can see him on the set bright and early tomorrow.

984
01:02:49,055 --> 01:02:52,058
明白 最后这句是真的吗?   - 最好是
- Check. And is that last part true? - Let's hope so.

985
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:53,643
这倒提醒了我: 给我"长翅如鹰"全部还在职的名单
That reminds me: I need a list of everyone

986
01:02:53,685 --> 01:02:55,979
who worked on On Wings as Eagles? who's still at the studio.

987
01:02:55,979 --> 01:02:58,356
On Wings as Eagles? that's a while ago, now.
"长翅如鹰"有段时间了

988
01:02:58,398 --> 01:03:00,525
除了败德跟导演 谁会有
Aside from Baird and the director it won't be a long list.

989
01:03:00,525 --> 01:03:03,361
好 把名单给我...还有事吗?    - 有
- Yeah, get it for me. That it? - No.

990
01:03:03,361 --> 01:03:06,489
还有一件:有位卡希达先生来电 说你认识他
One more thing: a Mr. Cuddahy called, said you know him.

991
01:03:06,531 --> 01:03:09,283
是 是    - 说有要事见你
- Yeah yeah. - Said it's urgent he see you one last time.

992
01:03:09,283 --> 01:03:11,619
建议你今晚七点在老地方见
Suggested same place, seven this evening.

993
01:03:11,661 --> 01:03:16,082
为什么? 别管了 好吧 跟他说我会去
Why? Never mind. Okay, tell him I'll be there.

994
01:03:16,082 --> 01:03:18,543
去你家?
- Back to your place? - Oh...

995
01:03:18,543 --> 01:03:21,671
你好啊 CC    - 我想我们还是...
- Hello, CC. - I rather thought we might go to...

996
01:03:22,005 --> 01:03:23,464
嗨 艾迪
Oh, hi, Eddie.

997
01:03:23,506 --> 01:03:25,300
Wanna lace up what you got on Merrily We Dance?
可以看看"欢乐岁月"吗?

998
01:03:25,341 --> 01:03:28,428
正在做 我要配些音乐
It's up now. I'll put some music on it.

999
01:03:46,237 --> 01:03:50,616
罗伦斯 罗伦兹导演
Laurence Laurentz presents

1000
01:03:54,203 --> 01:03:58,791
欢乐岁月
Merrily We Dance

1001
01:04:09,218 --> 01:04:10,720
计程车!
Taxi!

1002
01:04:18,895 --> 01:04:21,773
去你家?    - 多无聊
- Back to your place? - Oh, what a bore.

1003
01:04:21,814 --> 01:04:25,068
去昂那戴嘉湖度周末吧
I rather thought we might go to Lake Onega for the weekend.

1004
01:04:25,109 --> 01:04:26,569
就我们俩
Just the two of us.

1005
01:04:26,611 --> 01:04:28,905
我没带行李 留在你家玄关了
I don't have my valise I left it in your foyer.

1006
01:04:28,946 --> 01:04:32,200
没换衣服不会死啦     - 没事
- Oh, you'll get by without a change. - Suits me.

1007
01:04:32,241 --> 01:04:34,160
只要你不介意从你自己的派对上溜走 啊莱格
If you don't mind skipping out on your own party, Allegra.

1008
01:04:34,202 --> 01:04:36,663
没事    - 还要从盲弟身边溜走
- Suits me. - And skipping out on Monty.

1009
01:04:36,704 --> 01:04:38,581
也没事
That suits me as well.

1010
01:04:38,623 --> 01:04:40,667
喔 可怜的盲弟
Oh, poor Monty.

1011
01:04:40,875 --> 01:04:44,212
盲弟可不知道...     - 那就不会伤到盲弟
- What Monty doesn't know. - Won't hurt Monty.

1012
01:04:58,184 --> 01:05:02,480
喔 盲弟 过来沙发跟我坐
Oh, Monty. Come join me on the divan.

1013
01:05:10,905 --> 01:05:14,534
看来啊莱格不来了 真是无聊阿
It seems Allegra's a no show, which is simply a bore.

1014
01:05:14,575 --> 01:05:16,077
但 我可以...
But, I'll...

1015
01:05:26,045 --> 01:05:27,672
快按倒带...
Reverse...

1016
01:05:28,089 --> 01:05:30,216
快按倒带
Reverse. Reverse.

1017
01:05:43,313 --> 01:05:45,398
我不该戴围巾的
I shouldn't wear scarves.

1018
01:05:54,657 --> 01:05:58,369
看来阿格莱不来了 真是无聊阿
It seems Allegra's a no show, which is simply a bore.

1019
01:05:58,411 --> 01:06:00,705
但我可以陪你打桥牌
But, I'll partner you in bridge.

1020
01:06:00,705 --> 01:06:02,749
你干嘛摆臭脸?
Why the pout?

1021
01:06:06,336 --> 01:06:07,962
这可是...
It's...

1022
01:06:10,381 --> 01:06:12,258
很复杂的
complicated.

1023
01:06:12,925 --> 01:06:16,095
真高兴又看到你 曼尼斯先生
How pleasant to see you again, Mr. Mannix.

1024
01:06:16,721 --> 01:06:19,515
多谢你又回来 曼尼斯    - 还好
- Thanks for coming back, Mannix. - Sure.

1025
01:06:19,557 --> 01:06:21,809
你可把我们逼得豁出去了 不是吗?
You're taking us down to the wire, aren't you?

1026
01:06:22,185 --> 01:06:24,729
这可不是耍技俩 这是重大抉择
It's not a ploy. It's a big decision.

1027
01:06:24,771 --> 01:06:26,272
当然!没关系
Absolutely! No foul.

1028
01:06:26,272 --> 01:06:28,983
今天下午没能说服你 董事会很在意
But the board was concerned when I couldn't give them a yes this afternoon,

1029
01:06:28,983 --> 01:06:31,944
所以授权我呢
so, they've authorized me to say this.

1030
01:06:31,944 --> 01:06:36,074
只要你在十年合同上签字
You sign on, your term of contract is 10 years.

1031
01:06:37,241 --> 01:06:39,410
没错 你知道的 对吧?
Yeah. You get it, right?

1032
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:41,913
就是说你拿到股票选择权
That means your stock options are guaranteed to vest.

1033
01:06:41,955 --> 01:06:45,833
如果你在合约期满后退休你就不用再工作了
You'd never have to work again, if you chose to retire after your term.

1034
01:06:45,833 --> 01:06:47,669
考虑一下
Think about it.

1035
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:49,796
这可是终身职位
Life time employment.

1036
01:06:49,796 --> 01:06:51,965
You wouldn't be a glorified working stiff like you are now.不用像现在帮人打工
You wouldn't be a glorified working stiff like you are now.

1037
01:06:52,006 --> 01:06:54,759
你将经营一个事业 而非一个马戏团
You'll be running a business, not a circus.

1038
01:06:57,053 --> 01:06:58,304
喝点什么?
Drink?

1039
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:00,890
烟呢?
Cigarette?

1040
01:07:04,769 --> 01:07:06,854
不了   我得走了
No, no. I got to run.

1041
01:07:06,896 --> 01:07:08,439
我得跟我老婆谈谈
I should talk this over with my wife.

1042
01:07:08,481 --> 01:07:10,733
当然 该跟家人谈谈
Of course, talk it over, think about your family,

1043
01:07:10,775 --> 01:07:12,318
明早跟我说
let us know in the morning.

1044
01:07:12,318 --> 01:07:13,820
Oh!
Oh!

1045
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:16,864
就当这是贿赂
If you think this is a bribe, you're absolutely right.

1046
01:07:16,864 --> 01:07:18,491
你有两小孩吧 一男一女?
You have two kids, right, a boy and a girl?

1047
01:07:18,533 --> 01:07:19,492
没错
That's right.

1048
01:07:19,534 --> 01:07:22,829
他们会喜欢的 他们以前喜欢火车
They love this stuff. Used to be trains.

1049
01:08:24,557 --> 01:08:26,476
你好阿 霍比
Hello, Hobie.

1050
01:08:26,517 --> 01:08:28,353
喔 你好 卡洛塔
Oh, hello, Carlotta.

1051
01:08:28,394 --> 01:08:31,022
我迟到了吗?     - 不 没关系
- Am I late? - Oh no, it ain't nothing.

1052
01:08:31,064 --> 01:08:33,441
谢谢你和我忆起拍戏
Thanks an awful bunch for coming to this picture with me,

1053
01:08:33,441 --> 01:08:36,653
不知你喜不喜欢家畜 但我喜欢
I don't know if you like livestock but I think it's got moments

1054
01:08:36,653 --> 01:08:38,279
我真的喜欢...你真漂亮
I really do. You look very pretty

1055
01:08:38,321 --> 01:08:39,697
谢谢 霍比
Well, thank you, Hobie.

1056
01:08:39,739 --> 01:08:41,908
我一定会喜欢这部片子 你的片子我都喜欢
I'm sure I'll like the picture I like all of your pictures.

1057
01:08:41,908 --> 01:08:45,536
我也喜欢你的 都很神奇
Well, I like yours too, they are just the craziest things

1058
01:08:45,536 --> 01:08:48,039
头上顶着香蕉跳舞不容易吧?
Is it hard to dance with all them bananas on your head?

1059
01:08:48,081 --> 01:08:50,625
没啥  谁都会
Oh, no. Anyone can do it.

1060
01:08:52,961 --> 01:08:56,381
主要靠下半身 嘴唇 眼睛和大腿
It's all in the hips and the lips and the eyes and the thighs.

1061
01:09:24,534 --> 01:09:27,912
小艾迪要我跟你提提他的棒球赛
Little Eddie wanted me to tell you about his baseball game.

1062
01:09:27,954 --> 01:09:29,455
他们赢了
They won.

1063
01:09:29,497 --> 01:09:31,457
太棒了
That's terrific.

1064
01:09:32,208 --> 01:09:34,794
我忘了打给教练 艾迪是游击手吗?
I should've never called the coach! Eddie played at shortstop?

1065
01:09:34,836 --> 01:09:38,464
他打得很好 他想留在那
Mm, and he did so well, he wants to stay there now.

1066
01:09:38,464 --> 01:09:41,718
太好了  问题解决了
Great, it took care of itself.

1067
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,387
达琳的西班牙语考试考得很好
And Darlene did very well on her Spanish test.

1068
01:09:44,429 --> 01:09:47,307
太好了 她一直在担心说
That's good, she was worried about that.

1069
01:09:48,182 --> 01:09:49,976
谢谢你帮我煮的热饭 亲爱的
Thanks for heating up the roast, hon.

1070
01:09:50,018 --> 01:09:53,187
要热牛奶吗?   - 不了 谢谢 我要咖啡
- Warm glass of milk? - No, thanks, hon. Coffee.

1071
01:09:53,187 --> 01:09:56,649
我要赶回片场 有要事要处理
I gotta run back to the studio, a few things to take care of.

1072
01:09:56,691 --> 01:09:59,027
天阿 又要加班啦
Gee, another late night.

1073
01:09:59,068 --> 01:10:00,820
Mm.

1074
01:10:01,237 --> 01:10:04,615
知道吗  洛克希的开出更好的条件
You know. . . Lockheed improved their offer.

1075
01:10:04,657 --> 01:10:08,161
薪水高 也不会像现在那么忙
Darned good money. And the hours wouldn't be crazy like this, either.

1076
01:10:08,202 --> 01:10:10,622
有人要你是好事
It's nice to be wanted.

1077
01:10:10,663 --> 01:10:14,083
那当然  但...
Yeah, sure, but...

1078
01:10:14,667 --> 01:10:17,920
你怎么想? 他们要我明天回覆
what do you think? They wanna know tomorrow.

1079
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:20,757
我喜欢工作时间短点
I like the shorter hours.

1080
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:24,302
可是你怎么想 亲爱的? 你自己清楚
But what do you think, honey? You know best.

1081
01:10:26,888 --> 01:10:29,932
戒烟戒的怎么样了啊?
How's it going with the smoking, dear?

1082
01:10:30,224 --> 01:10:32,018
你知道啊...
Oh, you know...

1083
01:10:35,855 --> 01:10:41,444
洛杉矶的人们不是已经开始夜生活或入睡了
The denizens of Los Angeles make ready for nightlife, or for sleep.

1084
01:10:41,486 --> 01:10:44,447
但艾迪两者都没
But Eddie Mannix will have neither.

1085
01:10:46,699 --> 01:10:50,328
即便是在马里布海滩 太阳也已下山
Even in westerly Malibu the sun has moved on,

1086
01:10:50,370 --> 01:10:56,542
徒留辽阔而不知疲倦的大海 盲目地拍打海岸
leaving the vast and tireless sea to heave itself blindly upon the shore.

1087
01:10:59,170 --> 01:11:02,507
共产党们正享受少有的优闲
The communists welcome a rare moment of leisure.

1088
01:11:02,548 --> 01:11:05,551
抗争中短暂的休息
A brief surcease from struggle.

1089
01:11:08,846 --> 01:11:13,643
败德会拉客成了他们的信徒 追随他们的信念
Baird Whitlock has become their acolyte, a convert to their cause,

1090
01:11:13,685 --> 01:11:17,438
他的信念强烈而非勉强
his belief compelled but not grudging.

1091
01:11:17,689 --> 01:11:21,317
他渴望从博士那学到更多
He now seeks to learn more from professor Marcuse

1092
01:11:21,359 --> 01:11:24,112
好全力投入这项事业
and becomes ever more committed to the quest

1093
01:11:24,153 --> 01:11:28,950
促成人类历史终结 早日再创新人类
to hasten an end to history and bring on the New Man.

1094
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:30,702
这正是我要说的
That's exactly what I was talking about

1095
01:11:30,743 --> 01:11:32,870
我和丹尼在雷诺发生的事
that's what happened to me when I went to Reno with Danny Kaye

1096
01:11:32,870 --> 01:11:34,455
他要我帮他替背上的毛!
and he asked me to shave his back!

1097
01:11:34,497 --> 01:11:37,583
同样的事! 我在想 谁会从中获利?
Exact same thing! Because I'm thinking, who benefits?

1098
01:11:37,583 --> 01:11:41,004
另外 大家都认为丹尼是个混蛋
Also, I got to tell ya, everybody thinks Danny is a jerk

1099
01:11:41,004 --> 01:11:45,675
其实他不是 那不过是种观点 带出的反向观点罢了
he's not really a jerk, it's just the theory generating its own anti-theory.

1100
01:11:45,717 --> 01:11:47,719
不管  我们俩 就我和丹尼
Anyway, there we were, it's me and Danny,

1101
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,805
我在想 我这是在干嘛? 手里竟拿把剃刀
and I'm wondering what the hell am I doing with a razor in my hand

1102
01:11:50,847 --> 01:11:53,308
他说这是为了一部诺曼的电影
he says it's for a Norman Taurog picture

1103
01:11:53,349 --> 01:11:55,643
但朱蒂也在场 她认识诺曼
but Judy Canova is there and she knows Norman.

1104
01:11:55,685 --> 01:11:58,104
她说丹尼不是在拍诺曼的戏
She says, "Danny is not doing a Norman Taurog picture,

1105
01:11:58,104 --> 01:12:00,523
他只是要你帮他剃毛
he just wants you to shave his back."

1106
01:12:00,565 --> 01:12:02,984
获利的就是他
And that's who benefits.

1107
01:12:04,652 --> 01:12:06,154
"懒月亮" 霍比及惠特妮主演
HOBIE DOYLE "Lazy OL' MOON"

1108
01:12:06,195 --> 01:12:09,532
再另一个较有生气的地方
In livelier precincts, the swells of Dreamland

1109
01:12:09,574 --> 01:12:14,203
聚集了一群夜生活的人 检视着一块已然织成的丝娟柔纱
gather to inspect the completed weave of another piece of gossamer.

1110
01:12:14,245 --> 01:12:22,962
另一部电影 对终日辛劳的人类来说 不啻为一剂缓解痛苦的良药
Another movie, another portion of balm for the ache of a toiling mankind.

1111
01:12:27,342 --> 01:12:30,178
她在哪?   - 别发脾气 我在这呢
- Where is she? - Hold your horses, I'm right here.

1112
01:12:30,219 --> 01:12:31,804
你在想什么 卷毛的?
What's on your mind, Curly?

1113
01:12:31,804 --> 01:12:36,434
我把那块派从窗台拿走 其实不能怪我
Not my fault you saw me take that pie off the sill,

1114
01:12:36,476 --> 01:12:39,479
不怪你? 那怪谁  卷毛的?
Not your fault? Who's fault was it, Curly?

1115
01:12:39,479 --> 01:12:44,317
要怪喔...都怪那懒月亮!
Why that... crazy lazy full moon!

1116
01:12:44,484 --> 01:12:48,196
要是早两星期 你就看不到我偷派了
2 weeks ago, you'd never see me take it.

1117
01:12:50,657 --> 01:12:54,035
该死的月亮 有啥屁用
Darn you, moon. What good are you anyway.

1118
01:12:54,077 --> 01:12:57,747
我还不知道有这段 唱歌这场戏他们要我一次过
Don't know about this part, they only gave me one shot at the song.

1119
01:12:57,789 --> 01:13:00,124
真希望没有月亮
I wished there never was no moon.

1120
01:13:00,166 --> 01:13:03,044
也希望没有霸道的老女人
I wished there weren't no bossy ol' women.

1121
01:13:03,086 --> 01:13:07,340
别怪月亮 卷毛 它只会发亮
Don't blame that moon, Curly. She can't do nothing but shine.

1122
01:13:07,382 --> 01:13:12,345
懒月亮 一直亮着
Lazy ol' moon keep shining.

1123
01:13:12,387 --> 01:13:14,097
可恶
Darn you.

1124
01:13:14,097 --> 01:13:17,809
你再也没机会
You turn Curly Stirling in to the authorities

1125
01:13:17,809 --> 01:13:20,561
举发我卷毛啦
for the last time.

1126
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:26,401
懒月亮 一直亮着
Lazy ol' moon keep shining.

1127
01:13:28,027 --> 01:13:34,200
一如往常
pining just to be

1128
01:13:34,450 --> 01:13:37,996
在那古老的农场
On that old plantation,

1129
01:13:38,037 --> 01:13:41,165
我曾漫步游荡
where I used to roam

1130
01:13:41,165 --> 01:13:47,338
照亮疲惫的我的归途
Light my weary way back home.

1131
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:50,466
可恶 它去哪了?
Darn, where'd she go?

1132
01:13:50,466 --> 01:13:54,595
懒月亮 一直亮着
Lazy Old Moon keep shining,

1133
01:13:54,595 --> 01:14:01,227
月光洒在我身
shining down for me

1134
01:14:13,781 --> 01:14:18,870
在城市的另一角 另一组角色正要上演
Another part of town, another cast of characters.

1135
01:14:19,370 --> 01:14:23,082
艾迪要执行另一个任务
Another task, for Eddie Mannix.

1136
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:34,636

1138
01:14:36,679 --> 01:14:40,850
我们刚要为狄安娜解释
Ah, we're just getting started, I've been taking DeeAnna through this.

1139
01:14:40,892 --> 01:14:42,769
约瑟夫曾...
So Joseph has done...

1140
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:45,730
帮我们干过不少好事
well, just a whole lot of good work for us in the past

1141
01:14:45,772 --> 01:14:48,858
只要我们需要公证人或者第三者
Whenever we've needed a witness or a third party for,

1142
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:52,654

I don't know, a petition of grievance or alienation of affection.

1143
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:54,947
他可靠吗?    - 我是有担保的 小姐
- And he's reliable? - I'm bonded, miss.

1144
01:14:54,989 --> 01:14:59,494
约瑟夫是我们所知地球上最可靠的人
Joseph Silverman is the most reliable human being on the planet, in our experience.

1145
01:14:59,494 --> 01:15:03,706
那次克雷格酒驾撞到人
When Chubby Cregar was intoxicated and hit that pedestrian on Gower,

1146
01:15:03,706 --> 01:15:06,376
我们立马把车转到约瑟夫名下
we had that vehicle title transferred to Joe's name

1147
01:15:06,376 --> 01:15:09,921
让约瑟夫关了六个月
and Joe did 6 months in LA County lock-up.

1148
01:15:09,963 --> 01:15:11,631
你现在没喝酒了吧?
But you're off the sauce now?

1149
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:13,841
I never touch it. It was a legal 铿ction.
从不喝酒 那只是法律上作假

1150
01:15:13,883 --> 01:15:15,009
没错
That's right.

1151
01:15:15,009 --> 01:15:18,262
每当公司需要某个符合法律标准的...
When the studio needs someone who meets the legal standard of...

1152
01:15:18,304 --> 01:15:21,265
希德 该怎么说呢      - "那个人"
- how did you put it, Sid? - Personhood.

1153
01:15:21,307 --> 01:15:26,104
约瑟夫就会挺身而出扮演"那个人"
Joe steps in and acts as the, uh. . . person.

1154
01:15:26,145 --> 01:15:29,273
那你是专业的..."那个人"?
So you're a professional. . . person?

1155
01:15:29,315 --> 01:15:32,068
没错  小姐 请在这和这签名
That's right, miss. Initial here, and here.

1156
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:34,696
约瑟夫当养父直到你领养
Joe will be the foster parent until such time as

1157
01:15:34,737 --> 01:15:39,617
他一取得抚养权 你就马上可以申请领养
you adopt the child, which you can do as soon as Joe takes possession of it,

1158
01:15:40,243 --> 01:15:43,204
他可靠吗?   - 小姐 我是有担保的
- And he's reliable? - I'm bonded, miss.

1159
01:15:43,204 --> 01:15:46,207
你所签的文件不会公开
The release papers you're signing will not be a matter of public record.

1160
01:15:46,249 --> 01:15:50,962
所有文件会封存到2015年
all these documents will be sealed, until the year 2015.

1161
01:15:51,296 --> 01:15:54,173
谁也别耍小聪明    - 谁也别耍小聪明
- And no one's the wiser. - No one the wiser

1162
01:15:54,215 --> 01:15:56,968
没影迷 没媒体 没开庭
No fans. No press. No court officials.

1163
01:15:56,968 --> 01:16:01,180
甚至没公证人   - 约瑟夫自己就是
- Not even a notary public. - Joe himself is the notary.

1164
01:16:02,598 --> 01:16:05,727
你的手臂一定超壮的
You must have very strong forearms.

1165
01:16:06,227 --> 01:16:09,188
需要很多力气去压这个印监吧?
Is it hard, squeezing it like that?

1166
01:16:13,401 --> 01:16:15,778
这是我的工作 小姐
It's part of the job, miss.

1167
01:16:21,618 --> 01:16:25,038
曼尼斯先生 要通霄吗?    - 我们俩都要
- Late night, Mr. Mannix? - A late night for both of us.

1168
01:16:25,079 --> 01:16:28,666
Will you call Projection 7 and have them lace up yesterday's dailies on Hail, Caesar!?
打给七号影棚把"凯萨万岁"昨天拍的底片送来

01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,738
参与创造未来
and help forge the future.

1270
01:26:41,779 --> 01:26:47,660
我们留在这 继续潜伏 伪装资本家的佣人
We stay behind, continuing to serve in our disguise as capitalist handmaiden.

1271
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:51,831
但 这些钱该献给事业 而不是我们这些仆人
But, the money should go to the cause not to the servant of the cause.

1272
01:26:51,831 --> 01:26:52,999
没错!    - 没错
- Yes! - That's right.

1273
01:26:52,999 --> 01:26:54,792
这个...
We... Well...

1274
01:26:55,168 --> 01:26:59,547
是我们对共产党的微薄贡献
Our modest contribution to the Comintern.

1275
01:27:05,219 --> 01:27:07,430
他们会很高兴的
They will be pleased.

1276
01:27:10,099 --> 01:27:11,893
不!
No! No!

1277
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:14,228
恩格斯!
Eng...! Engels!

1278
01:27:15,188 --> 01:27:16,898
- Oh. - Oh...

1279
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:21,569
Oh, oh, no...

1280
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:32,497
你为什么要这样?
Why did you do that? Why did you do that?

1281
01:28:17,834 --> 01:28:19,294
Hoh.

1282
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:31,639
天啊 这么晚了 我麻烦大了
Oh, boy, it's late. I am in the doghouse.

1283
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:35,685
别载我去家里 去比佛利山酒店
Better forget about my place. Drop me off at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

1284
01:28:35,727 --> 01:28:37,603
好吧
Alright then.

1285
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:52,785
Huh!

1286
01:29:20,813 --> 01:29:23,816
你哪位?    - 陶德
- Who're you? - Todd.

1287
01:29:24,484 --> 01:29:26,152
陶德...
Todd...

1288
01:29:26,152 --> 01:29:28,613
你订的早餐是热的还盒装的?
You have a hot breakfast or a box breakfast?

1289
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:31,449
我...哪知啊
I... I don't know.

1290
01:29:31,699 --> 01:29:34,285
你是基本演员还是临时演员?
Are you a principal or an extra?

1291
01:29:34,744 --> 01:29:36,704
应该是基本演员吧
I think I'm a principal.

1292
01:29:36,746 --> 01:29:38,081
好
Yeah.

1293
01:29:38,456 --> 01:29:40,500
我在想"到底怎么回事!"
I'm thinking, "What the hell!"

1294
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:44,545
我也曾在陌生的房间里醒来
I've woken up in strange houses before but never without a broad next to me.

1295
01:29:44,545 --> 01:29:46,798
但身边至少会有个女人
- Uh-huh. - These guys were pretty interesting, though.

1296
01:29:46,798 --> 01:29:51,219
They've actually 铿gured out the laws that dictate... everything.
这些人挺有趣的 他们发现了支配一切的...规律

1297
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:54,555
历史 社会学 政治学 道德 等等一切
History, sociology, politics, morality. Everything.

1298
01:29:54,555 --> 01:29:58,226
都写在"资本论"里
It's all in a book called "Kapital", with a K.

1299
01:29:58,226 --> 01:29:59,435
是吗?   - 是喔
- That right? - Yeah.

1300
01:29:59,435 --> 01:30:01,104
你绝不会相信的
You're not gonna believe this,

1301
01:30:01,104 --> 01:30:04,399
他们甚至弄明白电影公司在干什么
these guys even figured it out what's going on here at the studio.

1302
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:09,570
这只不过是资本主义的一个工具
Because the studio is nothing more than an instrument of capitalism.

1303
01:30:09,612 --> 01:30:13,783
是的 我们盲目遵循这些规律 就像其他机构一样
Yes, so we blindly follows these laws like any other institution.

1304
01:30:13,825 --> 01:30:15,410
The laws these guys've 铿gured out.
他们却发现这些规律

1305
01:30:15,451 --> 01:30:18,830
电影公司用电影服务这系统
The studio makes pictures to serve the system,

1306
01:30:18,871 --> 01:30:22,709
这就是它的功能 就是我们所做的
that's it's function, that's really what we're all up to, here.

1307
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:24,961
- Is it? - Yeah, we're just con铿rming
是吗?    - 是 我们只不过是在证实

1308
01:30:25,003 --> 01:30:27,588
what they call the status quo.?
他们所谓的"现实"的东西

1309
01:30:27,630 --> 01:30:32,552
I mean, we might tell ourselves that we're creating?something of artistic value,
我是说 也许会跟自己说我们正在"创造"艺术价值

1310
01:30:32,593 --> 01:30:36,514
或者还会说...电影事业是有精神层面的
that there's some sort of spiritual dimension to the picture business,

1311
01:30:36,556 --> 01:30:39,559
但实际不过是只纽约的肥猫
but what it is, is this fat cat,

1312
01:30:39,559 --> 01:30:42,395
远在纽约的深刻先生经营着这家公司
Nick Schenk, out in New York running this factory

1313
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:44,605
然后略施小惠...
that's serving up these lollypops to the...

1314
01:30:44,647 --> 01:30:48,568
你们叫它是棒棒糖...
what did you use to call the a brand circuses for the...

1315
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:51,821
什么? 别...
What? Wait...

1316
01:30:52,572 --> 01:30:54,282
给我听好 混球
Now, you listen to me, buster.

1317
01:30:54,324 --> 01:30:56,075
深刻先生和这家公司待你不薄
Nick Schenk and this studio have been good to you

1318
01:30:56,075 --> 01:30:57,744
对其它在此工作的人都很好
and to everyone else who works here.

1319
01:30:57,744 --> 01:30:59,746
如果你再说深刻先生坏话
If I ever hear you bad mouthing Mr. Schenk again

1320
01:30:59,787 --> 01:31:02,248
我就送你去坐牢
it'll be the last thing you say before I have you tossed into jail

1321
01:31:02,248 --> 01:31:03,708
你再好好说去
for colluding in your own abduction.

1322
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:06,085
艾迪 我不会那样
Eddie! I wouldn't, I would never do that.

1323
01:31:06,419 --> 01:31:07,587
闭嘴
Shut up.

1324
01:31:07,629 --> 01:31:09,631
快滚出去 把"凯萨万岁!"演完
You're going to go out there and you're going to finish "Hail, Caesar!"

1325
01:31:09,672 --> 01:31:11,799
你要把那段话说完
You're gonna give the speech at the feet of the penitent thief

1326
01:31:11,841 --> 01:31:14,761
而且要字字相信
and you're gonna believe every word you say.

1327
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:17,597
你是个演员 你就是吃这行饭的
You're gonna do it because you're an actor and that's what you do.

1328
01:31:17,597 --> 01:31:19,140
就像那些导演
Just like the director does what he does,

1329
01:31:19,182 --> 01:31:21,476
编剧 场记 打版的
and the writer and the script girl and the guy who claps the slate.

1330
01:31:21,517 --> 01:31:23,728
你必须去做 因为这部戏有价值
You're gonna do it because the picture has Worth

1331
01:31:23,770 --> 01:31:27,357
为本片服务 你就有价值 这点可别忘了
and you have Worth if you serve the picture and you're never gonna forget that again.

1332
01:31:27,398 --> 01:31:29,233
好好 艾迪
Okay, Eddie, okay.

1333
01:31:30,109 --> 01:31:31,986
我不会忘了 艾迪
I won't forget it, Eddie.

1334
01:31:32,403 --> 01:31:34,280
最好别忘了
You're damn right you won't.

1335
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:36,908
只要我还当位
Not as long as I run this dump.

1336
01:31:41,913 --> 01:31:43,539
败德
Baird.

1337
01:31:46,834 --> 01:31:49,462
做好你的明星!
Go out there and be a star!

1338
01:31:50,421 --> 01:31:52,340
曼尼斯先生!
Mr. Mannix!

1339
01:31:53,466 --> 01:31:56,302
既然你要上车了 就把花拿去吧
Since you're going to your car, I thought you might want to take this.

1340
01:31:56,302 --> 01:31:58,930
这是什么?    - 狄安娜送的
- What is it? - From DeeAnna Moran.

1341
01:31:58,972 --> 01:32:02,308
为了谢谢你 她不用领养自己的孩子了
Thank you, and she doesn't need to adopt her baby after all.

1342
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:03,434
Huh!

1343
01:32:03,476 --> 01:32:06,312
她昨晚请约瑟夫吃饭 看来是聊得不错
She asked Joe Silverman out for dinner last night,

1344
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:08,398
然后开车去棕榈泉
and I guess it went well, they drove to Palm Springs

1345
01:32:08,439 --> 01:32:10,733
今天一早三点结婚了
and were married at three this morning.

1346
01:32:10,775 --> 01:32:12,151
Huh.

1347
01:32:12,318 --> 01:32:14,279
会去很久吗? 今天行程
Will you be gone long? Today's call list.

1348
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,197
不 不到一小时就回来 有私事要办
No, less than an hour, personal errand.

1349
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:18,324
这束花配得不错
- Ah. - It's a nice arrangement.

1350
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:21,577
她把帐记在公司头上了   - 是喔
- She charged it to the studio. - Right.

1351
01:32:22,287 --> 01:32:24,706
刚好要找你(这是朵拉)    - 早啊
- (Thora): Just coming to see you. - Good morning.

1352
01:32:24,747 --> 01:32:26,207
昨晚很抱歉 朵拉
Sorry about last night, Thora,

1353
01:32:26,207 --> 01:32:27,959
我不知你姊会来
I didn't know your sister would show up.

1354
01:32:28,001 --> 01:32:30,837
也许是这样 但我不经一事 不长一智
Well that's as may be, but I certainly learned my lesson.

1355
01:32:30,878 --> 01:32:32,714
艾迪 今天不管你说什么
Whatever you say today, Eddie Mannix,

1356
01:32:32,714 --> 01:32:35,258
明天我还是要登...
my column tomorrow is about...

1357
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:37,427
On Wings as Eagles.?
“长翅如鹰”

1358
01:32:37,468 --> 01:32:40,096
朵拉 我建议你还是别写    - 我就知道你会这样说
- Thora, I wouldn't do that if I were you. - I'm sure you wouldn't.

1359
01:32:40,096 --> 01:32:43,266
不 不 你还不知道 我们坐下说
No, no, no, you don't understand. Let's sit down.

1360
01:32:43,308 --> 01:32:47,270
我要你别登是为你好
I'm telling you not to run the column, Thora, for your own good.

1361
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:48,938
我自己知道谁好谁坏
I can judge my own interest.

1362
01:32:48,938 --> 01:32:50,815
这会是年度最佳报导
This will be the story of the year

1363
01:32:50,815 --> 01:32:54,360
赫斯报业集团正再重振好莱坞专栏
And it so happens, the Hearst Syndicate is looking to pick up a Hollywood column.

1364
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:57,155
你认为这是轻而易举的?    - 当然
- And you think this'll cinch it for you. - You know it will.

1365
01:32:57,196 --> 01:33:00,033
败德是你们最有名的明星
Baird Whitlock, your biggest star,

1366
01:33:00,074 --> 01:33:02,869
got his 铿rst major part in On Wings as Eagles?
在"长翅如鹰"一片中担当第一主角

1367
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:05,413
靠的是与该片导演搞同性恋
by engaging in sodomy

1368
01:33:05,455 --> 01:33:08,207
就是那位罗伦斯罗伦兹
with the picture's director, Laurence Laurentz.

1369
01:33:08,249 --> 01:33:10,251
这个我们都知道了
We've all heard the story.

1370
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:12,253
但有件事你没听过
But here's something you haven't heard:

1371
01:33:12,253 --> 01:33:15,340
你消息来源是个共产党
your source is a communist.

1372
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:17,884
如果你报了就会被抓
If you print it it'll be dismissed as a commie smear tactic

1373
01:33:17,884 --> 01:33:20,470
你也会被当作共产党帮凶被解雇
and you'll be dismissed as a commie stooge.

1374
01:33:20,511 --> 01:33:23,097
伯特已经离开这国家 他所属的集团
Burt Gurney has left the country, the cell he was part of

1375
01:33:23,097 --> 01:33:25,350
也被警方捣毁
has been smashed by the police.

1376
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:29,312
或许你认为他可信 因为他是劳伦兹先生的现任...宠儿
You might've thought he was credible because he's Mr. Laurentz's current... protege,

1377
01:33:29,354 --> 01:33:34,150
但你不想被当作伯特的喉舌吧?
but, you don't want to be seen as Burt Gurney's mouthpiece after this.

1378
01:33:34,275 --> 01:33:36,611
你怎么知道伯特是我的消息来源?
How did you know Burt was my source?

1379
01:33:36,653 --> 01:33:39,906
昨天深夜跟罗伦斯谈过 得出这样推论
Late last night, I talked to Laurence, put two and two together.

1380
01:33:39,906 --> 01:33:42,825
既然碰到你了 我就不必给你送去了
Well, no reason to send this since I ran into you.

1381
01:33:42,825 --> 01:33:45,411
这是为昨晚特色莉不请自来表示歉意
It's by way of apology for Thessaly homing in last night.

1382
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:47,372
我很看重我们的友谊 朵拉
I do value our friendship, Thora.

1383
01:33:47,372 --> 01:33:49,791
我还有要事 快迟到了
And I'm late for something important.

1384
01:34:10,687 --> 01:34:14,482
为何向这个希伯来人下跪 喔脱落糗死?
Why on your knees before this Hebrew, Autolochus?

1385
01:34:14,649 --> 01:34:17,402
我昨天遇见过他 格拉古
I encountered him before, Gracchus,

1386
01:34:17,402 --> 01:34:20,071
就在去约沙法的井边
beside the well of Jehosaphat.

1387
01:34:21,281 --> 01:34:23,908
举止多高贵的人啊
And what manner of man.

1388
01:34:23,908 --> 01:34:27,829
他是以色列人的祭司 却被其他祭司所不容
He is a priest of the Israelites, despised even by the other priests.

1389
01:34:27,829 --> 01:34:32,125
不  在昨的行军中
No. On yesterday's march,

1390
01:34:32,125 --> 01:34:34,544
一路上的风尘让我困顿
punished by the dust of the road,

1391
01:34:34,544 --> 01:34:36,462
I sought to drink 铿rst at the well,
我抢着要头一个喝到井水

1392
01:34:36,462 --> 01:34:40,758
而我所管的那些奴隶们干渴远甚于我
before the slaves and my charge who's thirst was far greater than my own.

1393
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:43,303
本来就罗马人先于奴隶
A Roman drinks before a slave.

1394
01:34:43,303 --> 01:34:45,680
这个人给所有人水喝
This man was giving water to all.

1395
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:48,725
他眼中没有罗马人和奴隶
He saw no Roman and he saw no slave.

1396
01:34:48,766 --> 01:34:50,852
只有人
He saw only men.

1397
01:34:50,893 --> 01:34:53,646
虚弱的人 他给予救助

对罪人 他却给予爱

他看到了我的罪和贪婪 格拉古
He saw my own sin, Gracchus, and greed.

但我在眼中却没看到责备
But in his eyes, I saw no shadow of reproach.

1403

在这片骄阳灼烤的土地上

以个普通人的样

我又偷抽了一根还是两根烟

Of course, my son.

1448
01:37:37,226 --> 01:37:40,063
是不是轻而易举的事

我不知怎么解释
