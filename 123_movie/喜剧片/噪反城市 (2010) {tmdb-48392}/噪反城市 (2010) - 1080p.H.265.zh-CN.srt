我小时候他总是在巡演

13
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,480

24
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,460
我能关小一点吗

25
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,640

What do we know?

31

我们接到报警  说车里有滴答声

38
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,280
安静
Silence!

43
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,330
是个节拍器

44
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,690
放在前座上了
On the front seat.

45
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,310
这事可以结了

46
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,820
-你疯了  -我开始就知道是这个

47
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,930
说不定是炸弹
It could have been a bomb.

48
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,130
这种滴答声我太熟悉了
I know that kind of ticking all too well.

49
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,810
我们要继续  马格纳斯
We have to move on, Magnus.

50
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,150
必须想点大计划
We have to think bigger.

51
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,100
应该给他们个真炸弹
A real bomb is what they deserve.

52
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,250
给你的
For you.

53
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,440
这是什么
What is it?

54
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,510
一座城市和六个鼓手

56
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,270
没有
No.

57
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,850
还在概念阶段
Let's just say it's rather conceptual.

58
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,520
那节拍器到底怎么回事
What the hell is all this about metronomes?

59
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,430
交警已经接手了
Traffic police have taken over.

60
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,650
你有比处理酒驾

61
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,910
更重要的事

62
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:26,880
继续工作
Back to work!

63

这简直是神作
This is a masterpiece!

64
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,980
你最好的作品
Your best work ever!

65
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,410
你真这么认为吗
You think so?

66
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,020
我们说的就是这个
It's everything we've talked about.

67
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,190
这就是我们的炸弹
This is our bomb!

68
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,630
听听这座城市  已经被垃圾音乐污染了
Listen to this city, contaminated by shitty music...

69
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,560
是时候反击了
It's time to strike back.

70
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,700
我们要给这城市上演一场刻骨铭心的音乐会
We'll give this city a concert it'll never forget.

71
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,940
我们还要四个鼓手
We need four more drummers.

72
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,770
必须是高手中的高手
They must be the best.

73
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,810
约翰内斯・比约克
Johannes Bjork.

74
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,440
当然
Of course.

75
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,860
真正的诗人
A true poet.

76
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,390
别玩了  继续伴奏
Go back to playing!

77
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,700
我们需要马库斯・哈罗德森
We'll need Marcus Haraldson.

78
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,050
他还活着吗
Is he alive?

79
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,590
活着  我们前几天还一起喝过酒
Yes, we had a beer the other day.

80
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,430
一万瓦  可够他受的
10000 volts... It was pretty rough for him.

81
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,430
你个臭傻逼  从此别想再打了
You fucking idiot! That was the last time!

82
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,640
我还要麦兰
And I want Myran.

83
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,830
这样就有五个了
That makes five.

84
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,550
还要一个

86
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,880
他不行  他已经有稳定工作了
He's not available. He has a steady job now.

87
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,710
-在爱乐乐团  -什么
- With the philharmonic. - What?

88
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,180
为了生计
Everyone's gotta eat...

89
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,780
就算要卖身也只能忍了
even if it means whoring yourself.

90
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,790
我讨厌海顿
I hate Haydn.

91
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,790
海顿: 奥地利著名作曲家

92
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,140
谢谢
Thank you.

93
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,820
敲定音鼓的那位
You, on the kettle drums...

94
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,310
你敲太早了
You were too early.

95
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,210
我掐准时间敲的
I was spot-on.

96
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,450
好吧
Ok...

97
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,740
你能准时就谢天谢地了
That's what you should have been, on time.

98
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,330
从第九小节开始
Let's take it from bar nine.

99
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,230
谢谢
Thank you.

100
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,760
你知道现在几点吗
You have the time?

101
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,730
你用的是芬兰时间吧  总是快一个小时
Are you in sync with Finland? You're one hour early.

102
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,700
这能有多难
How difficult can it be?

103
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,810
再来一次  从第九节开始
Once more, bar nine.

104
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,560
我们不怎么卖这种东西了
We don't sell many of these anymore.

105
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,040
现在大家都买电子的
People go for digital today.

106
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,200
这要么是从我这里买的  要么就是从施罗德那里
It could either come from here or Schroder's.

107
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,710
确定没有登记过吗  没有编码什么的吗
But surely they're registered? With a serial number?

108
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,670
这只是个节拍器
It's a metronome.

109
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:03,140
如果你们不怎么卖这种节拍器
If you don't sell many like this,

110
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,200
那你应该记得...
you should remember...

111
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:05,720
不记得
No.

112
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,450
一点都不记得吗
Nothing at all?

113
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:10,580
不记得
No.

114
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,680
还有别的事吗
Anything else?

115
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,500
我再随便看看
I'll just have a look around.

116
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,140
你在这儿工作吗
Do you work here?

117
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:47,670
不
No.

118
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,210
要买什么东西吗
Looking for something?

119
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,260
想给我弟弟买个礼物
A present for my brother.

120
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,490
他是音乐家
A musician?

121
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,230
他其实是指挥家
Actually, he's a conductor.

122
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,590
但你手上的是康茄音乐
Because that's music for congas.

123
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,500
我来看看
Let's have a look...

124
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,570
买这个吧
Take this.

125
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,220
指挥家的话  送这个再好不过了
The perfect gift for a conductor.

126
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,650
谢谢
Thanks.

127
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,210
谢谢你的建议
Thanks for the advice.

128
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,840
阿玛德斯
Amadeus!

129
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,060
阿玛德斯  亲爱的  见到你真高兴
Amadeus, darling! So lovely to see you.

130
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,420
快进来  他马上要来了
Hurry inside. He'll soon be here.

131
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:49,020
最近抓到坏蛋了吗
Caught any baddies lately?

132
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:55,310
有小提琴家诈骗了吗
Any violinists caught fiddling?

133
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:55,310
注: 英语中拉小提琴和偷懒一语双关

134
00:16:59,320 --> 00:16:59,910
让・皮埃尔
Jean-Pierre...

135
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,180
见过阿玛德斯吗
Have you met Amadeus?

136
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,890
奥斯卡的兄弟
Oscar's brother.

137
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,980
很高兴见到你
Nice to meet you.

138
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,580
我都不知道奥斯卡还有个兄弟
I didn't know Oscar had a brother.

139
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,710
是哥哥
Big brother.

140
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,260
你演奏什么乐器
What do you play?

141
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,380
阿玛德斯是个警察
Amadeus is a policeman.

142
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,110
是吗
Really...

143
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:21,430
我听说里克夫斯基在爱乐交响乐团
I heard Likovskij with the philharmonic orchestra.

144
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:24,380
那真是太棒了
It was absolutely fantastic!

145
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,320
里克夫斯基是滥竽充数
Likovskij is an impostor.

146
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,130
我同意  他没有原创性  
I quite agree. He's not original,

147
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,640
只会模仿别人
he simply imitates others.

148
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,500
你怎么也这么认为
How can you agree?

149
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,770
奥斯卡来了
Oscar's coming!

150
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,780
怎么了
What's going on here?

151
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,130
人好多啊
So many people!

152
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,480
真高兴见到你们
I'm so happy to see you all here.

153
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,770
我很感动
I'm very touched.

154
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,420
敬奥斯卡
A toast to Oscar!

155
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,350
敬奥斯卡
To Oscar!

156
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,320
酒和零食在另一个房间
Wine and nibbles are in the other room.

157
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,110
大家自便
Help yourselves!

158
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,600
这是...
Well...

159
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:11,470
阿玛德斯
Amadeus.

160
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,000
-很高兴见到你  -我也是
- Nice to see you. - Likewise.

161
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,240
祝贺你  要开音乐会了
Congratulations. For the concert.

162
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:18,760
是啊
Yes...

163
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:19,860
很棒
It's great.

164
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:23,080
谢谢
You're welcome, of course.

165
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,480
我可以给你一张票  要几张都没问题
I can get you a ticket. Or several, if you like.

166
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,190
我不确定是不是...
I'm not sure I'll be able to...

167
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,950
-如果有时间的话  -当然了
- If I can find the time... - Of course.

168
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,330
你一定要去音乐会
You must come to the concert.

169
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:40,100
你父亲会很骄傲的
Your father would have been so proud.

170
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,880
我尽量吧
I'll try to make it.

171
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,340
祝贺你
Congratulations.

172
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:48,250
这是什么
What's this?

173
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:55,340
还送我礼物
A present!

174
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,300
初级放克贝斯
''Funk bass for beginners.''

175
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,350
什么
What?

176
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,900
这是放克贝斯音乐
This is music for funk bass.

177
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,640
我不弹放克贝斯的  阿玛德斯
I don't play funk bass, Amadeus.

178
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,480
我是指挥家
I'm a conductor.

179
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,240
一定是搞错了
It must be some kind of mistake.

180
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:18,880
我明白你的意思
I get it.

181
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,050
我也不知道要给警察送什么
I wouldn't know what to give a policeman!

182
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,680
放克贝斯也挺好的  不是吗
But funk bass is nice, isn't it?

183
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,900
我们开始独奏会吧  老规矩
Let's move on to the recital, as per usual.

184
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,360
我不是故意的
I didn't mean to...

185
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,540
露西亚先弹
Lucia will play first!

186
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,010
-你好  -你好
- Hello. - Hi.

187
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,150
该交房租了
It's time for the rent.

188
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,610
才二十号呢
But it's only the 20th.

189
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,650
还是早点付清好  是吧
We might as well get it over with, right?

190
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,760
-我去跟马格纳斯说  -还有
- I'll talk to Magnus. - And...

191
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:54,910
除了房租
Apart from that...

192
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,470
别的都没问题吧
Everything else is ok?

193
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:00,790
没问题
Yes.

194
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,160
你们在里面干嘛
What is it you do in there?

195
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:11,640
搞色情活动吗
Is it porn?

196
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,550
不是  不是色情
No, it's not porn.

197
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,360
我会跟马格纳斯说房租的事
I'll talk to Magnus about the rent.

198
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,510
萨娜  我没法跟这些人合作
Sanna, I can't work with these guys!

199
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,530
他们已经打了三个小时了  
They've been playing for three hours.

200
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,270
一刻都没停过
Non-stop!

201
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,800
根本没法让他们停下来
There's no way of stopping them!

202
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,520
好了
Ok.

203
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,440
第一段独奏我来打
I get the first solo.

204
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,080
好极了
Good.

205
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,980
我们开工吧
Let's get started.

206
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:06,950
很高兴见到你们
It's good to see you all.

207
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,090
总共四个乐章
There are...

208
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,520
在四个地点
four movements. In four locations.

209
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:17,210
我事先声明  有些活动是违法的
I want it to be really clear that some things will be illegal.

210
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,750
有些很危险
Some will be dangerous.

211
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:20,780
但是
But...

212
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,580
这是真正的艺术
it'll be one hell of a work of art.

213
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,340
拿反了
It's upside down.

214
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:30,760
你说什么
What's that?

215
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,190
你把谱子拿反了
You're holding it upside down!

216
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,080
我们有很多准备工作  马格纳斯  
We've lots to do. Magnus?

217
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:40,030
第一步是定位音源
The first step is to locate the sounds.

218
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,120
找到
It's vital

219
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,190
能当低音鼓和的军鼓的音源
we find a sound that'll act as a bass drum

220
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,660
至关重要
and one that'll act as a snare drum.

221
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:50,980
还要找和弦  这是最难的
Then there are the chords. That'll be the hardest.

222
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,250
分头行动
We'll split up.

223
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,270
只要最好的音源
Only keep the best sounds.

224
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:59,850
仔细找  要把可能的地方都找遍
Be meticulous. Leave no stones unturned.

225
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,340
我们需要一个人
We'll need a human body.

226
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,860
不能太瘦
Not too skinny.

227
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:13,860
也不能太胖
Not too fat.

228
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,900
必须能出现共振效果
But it has to have good resonance.

229
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:23,440
你能想象我这等人物待在这里是什么感觉
You can imagine how someone like me must feel in here.

230
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:26,190
实在有些不得其所
I feel quite out of place.

231
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,370
还好  我有我的粉丝
Luckily, I have my fans.

232
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:29,410
他们崇拜我  
They worship me.

233
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,280
看看这些礼物和花就知道了
Just look at all the gifts and flowers.

234
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,670
医生确诊以后
When the doctors gave me their verdict,

235
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,520
做决定也就不难了
the decision was easy to make.

236
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:41,770
我的痔疮面积实在太大
My haemorrhoids had grown out of all proportion.

237
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,110
只能通过手术解决
Surgery was the only option.

238
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:48,120
我们再拍两张照片就结束吧  好吗
Let's wrap it up with some photos, shall we?

239
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,640
我们还要一辆推土机
We'll need a bulldozer.

240
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:14,160
一辆柴油机  最少四百马力
A diesel, 400 horsepower, minimum.

241
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,660
明天就行动
It'll take place tomorrow.

242
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,350
我们在这里碰头
We'll meet up here.

243
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,500
五楼
5th floor.

244
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:39,110
看我指示  我示意中止才能中止
Keep an eye on me. Abort on my signal only.

245
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,470
第一乐章

246
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,600
医生
医生

247
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,800
往我菊花里充气

248
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,010
怎么回事
What's going on?

249
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:22,030
就不能等我睡醒了再动刀子吗
Can't I finish my sleep before you cut me open?

250
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,320
我可是奥简・勒凡德
I am Orjan Levander.

251
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,030
等等  你们确定...
Hang on, are you sure...

252
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,200
一  二  三  四
One, two, three, four!

253
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,030
请勿接触病人
Don't touch the patient.

254
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,090
请勿接触病人
Don't touch the patient.

255
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,560
开始吧  安德斯
Go for it, Anders!

256
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:17,330
麦兰  你在干什么
Myran! What are you doing!

257
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:17,980
不能怪我
It's not my fault!

258
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,520
让开
Clear!

259
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,610
救命
Help!

260
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,140
救命
Help!

261
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,750
天哪
Oh my God...

262
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,530
别开玩笑了
Stop pulling our legs!

263
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:43,310
你们谁要海顿音乐会的票吗
Would anyone like a ticket for the Haydn concert?

264
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,900
-我弟弟给了我一张  -不要
- My brother gave me an extra. - Christ, no!

265
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,840
我很忙
I'm busy.

266
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:51,170
不用了  谢谢  他的所有CD我都有  
No thanks. I already have all his CD's.

267
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:51,910
那家伙很厉害
That guy's brilliant.

268
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,170
真的
Really.

269
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,030
什么叫"他的所有CD"
What do you mean, ''all his CD's''?

270
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:57,510
我收集了他所有的CD
I have all of his CD's.

271
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,130
医院来电话了
The hospital called.

272
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,830
-你知道奥简・勒凡德吧  -那个电视明星吗
- You know Orjan Levander? - The TV guy?

273
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:15,730
他去医院做直肠手术
He's in for rectal surgery.

274
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,270
结果几个混蛋闯进病房骚扰了他
Some sick bastards got into his room and molested him.

275
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,830
院长是我的朋友
The hospital director is a friend.

276
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:24,200
不能走漏风声  让媒体知道
The press mustn't get wind of this.

277
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,560
勒凡德威胁说要起诉
Levander's threatening to sue.

278
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,610
说他被恐怖分子袭击了
He's saying he's been attacked by terrorists.

279
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,500
你要帮我查个水落石出
Help me get to the bottom of it.

280
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,550
汉斯

283
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,170
发生这事太糟糕了
It's just terrible, all this.

284
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:51,200
我是警察  能见见奥简・勒凡德吗
Police. I'd like to see Orjan Levander?

285
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,200
-他就在这儿  -谢谢

286
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,780

-他失声了吗  -什么
- Has he lost his voice? - Sorry?

289
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,450
你得跟他们说
You have to take them.

290
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:24,280
你用的药和别病人都是一样的
You get the same treatment as everyone else in here!

291
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,510
放手
Let go!

292
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,240
你能
Can you...

293
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:31,620
读唇语吗  我想问他几个问题
lip-read? I'd like to ask him some questions.

294
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,420
那就是勒凡德
There's Levander.

295
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,920
我觉得他们可能是精神病人
I think we're looking at some kind of psychosis.

296
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,940
也可能是

297
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,680
捷克来的客座科学家
the guest scientists from the Czech Republic.

298
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,300
醒醒  勒凡德

301
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:26,500
你干什么
What are you doing?

302
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:31,690
继续演奏
Let's play!

303
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,980
把气泵开起来
Pump it up!

304
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:34,520
好的  继续打
Let's go for it!

305
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:36,140
请勿接触病人

307
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,610
音乐家

309
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,130
请勿接触病人
Don't touch the patient.

310
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:35,890
暂停
Stop the tape!

311
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:38,800
后退一点
Back a bit.

312
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:40,450
停
There!

313
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,650
走路看着点儿
Watch where you're going!

314
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,270
这事真是太糟糕了
It's just terrible, all this.

315

Good grief!

318
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:55,510
指挥家的话  送这个再好不过了
The perfect gift for a conductor.

319
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,050
你好
Hi.

320
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,400
你来干嘛
What are you doing here?

321
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,630
我给你的那个礼物  能还给我吗
The gift I gave you... Can I have it back?

322
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,540
那很重要
It's important.

323
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,230
我还没练好放克贝斯呢
I haven't finished practicing funk bass.

326
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:28,940
你在玩我吗
You are joking?

327
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,030
不是  很抱歉 
No, unfortunately.

328
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,080

330
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:40,730

331
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,930
第一次袭击  "医生  医生"
The first attack: ''Doctor, doctor.''

332
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,430
在医院里
At the hospital.

333
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:25,380
下一次是  "给你钞票  蜜糖"[实为蜜糖/亲爱的双关]
The next one is: ''Money 4 U, honey.''

334
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:27,640
他们对勒凡德做了什么
What did they do to Levander?

335
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,250
他们在他身上演奏音乐
They played music on him.

336
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:35,160
演奏音乐  哈格曼
Music, Hagman.

337
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,280
勒凡德变成了节拍乐器
Levander became a rhythm instrument.

338
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,430
"蜜糖"
''Honey.''

339
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,550
桑切兹  查一下"蜜糖"指什么  
Sanchez, check up on ''honey''.

340
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,490
是名字还是暗号
Is it a name? A code?

341
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,150
去查一查
Check it out.

342
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:49,480
查"哈尼"  这就去查  蜜蜂...
Check up on ''honey''. I'm on it. Bees...

343
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:50,840
哈格曼  查"钱"
Hagman, check ''money''.

344
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:53,790
看股票市场  银行  
Threats on the Stock Market,

345
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,010
还有其他跟钱有关的地方有没有受到恐吓
banks, anywhere to do with money.

346
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,280
能帮我查下这上面的指纹吗
Can you run this for fingerprints?

347
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,920
但要小心
But be discreet

348
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,100
结果只要给我一个人
and only give the results to me,

349
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,530
亲自给我
in person.

350
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,740
你觉得这是什么声音
How does this sound to you?

351
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,320
你敲它的声音
It sounds like you're knocking.

352
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:33,880
是吗
Really?

353
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:36,470
是的
Yes.

354
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:40,580
他们用这个演奏过  
They played on this.

355
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,820
现在我听不见它的声音了
And now I can't hear it.

356
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,860
这是什么听力测试吗
Is this some kind of hearing test?

357
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,260
你脑子他妈怎么想的
Why the hell did you do that?

358
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,940
我派了我最得力的警员去
I turn up with one of my best policemen,

359
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,040
但事实证明这名优秀的警员
and it turns out that this brilliant policeman

360
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:04,530
其实是只狒狒
proves to be a baboon.

361
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,890
一只他妈的用铁盘
A baboon banging metal trays

362
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,510
敲医院墙壁的狒狒
on the hospital's bloody walls!

363
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:12,410
是帮搞音乐的袭击了勒凡德
Levander's attackers are musicians.

364
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,390
他们还会继续作案的
And they will strike again.

365
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,420
是吗
Oh, really?

366
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,130
这是表演节目单
This is a concert program.

367
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,330
包括四个不同的乐章
There are four different movements.

368
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,190
给你钞票  亲爱的
"Money 4 U, honey"

369
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:24,550
去他妈的音乐
"Fuck the music!"

370
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:25,970
电爱
"Electric Love"

371
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,080
去他妈的音乐
"Fuck the music..."

372
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,820
干你们的活儿
Carry on.

373
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:38,480
正干着呢
I'm on it.

374
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:55,250
给你钞票  亲爱的

375
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:56,880
不错
Ok.

376
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:07,610
这次可别再把谁搞死
Try not to kill anyone this time.

377
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,200
行动吧
Let's do it.

378
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,760
第二乐章

379
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:25,720
给你

380
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:25,720
钞票

381
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,720
亲爱的

382
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,700
这是场演出
This is a gig!

383
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,000
所有人别紧张  过去
Everybody keep calm! Move!

384
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:33,910
我们不想伤害任何人
We don't want to hurt anyone!

385
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:36,080
我们只是来演奏的

386
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,140
你们就是我们的听众

三分钟后开始

00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:56,350
1  2  3  4

391
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,160
这地区有24个养蜂人
There are 24 beekeepers in the region.

392
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,650

沃纳布灵

银行的警报响了  有人抢劫
The bank alarm's gone off. A hold-up.

395
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:18,410

396
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,710
为什么总是我坐这边
Why do I always get to sit on this side?

397
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,030
他们都蒙了面罩吗

398
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:04,330
蒙了  黑色的套头罩

桑切兹  让他们安静

都静一静
Silence!

401
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:26,480
没错  就是他们
Yes, it's them.

402
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:29,020
这里一定还有个节拍器

403
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:30,720
找出来

曾把音乐学院给淹了

408
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,760
她上过音乐学院吗

409
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:51,020
算是吧  不过她被开除了

有她的地址吗
You have an address?

00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:01,530
只有邮箱地址
Just a PO Box.

00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:02,740
就知道这些
That's all.

414
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:07,320

有什么事劳您大驾光临  探员
To what do I owe such an honour, Inspector?

418
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:42,700
是有人弹跑调了吗[也有偷盗的意思]
Someone's been playing in the wrong key?

419
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:45,550
还是哪个小提琴家练琴了[也有诈骗的意思]
Any violinists caught fiddling?

是有关贵校的一名学生
It concerns one of your students:

422

萨娜・博森

423
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:57,090
博森

424
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:02,470
我的办公室去年就该翻修了
My office should've been renovated a year ago.

425
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,060
她那些想法害苦了我们

426
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:08,910
她用镇纸  马粪

427
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:13,120
还有乱七八糟的垃圾创作音乐

之后她又迷上了水
Then she became obsessed with water.

429
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:18,060
水  水  水
Water, water, water.

430
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:19,890
我的天啊
My God!

她是我们学校的耻辱
She was a disgrace to this establishment!

432
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:24,450
你还有她以前的作品吗
You still have any of her work?

433
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:28,740
没多少  警察以前调查的时候都搜查过了
Not much. The police went through it during the investigation.

434
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:31,750
我会让我的秘书帮你找找
I'll ask my secretary to help you.

435
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:34,570
那一年太可悲了
It was a sad year.

436
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,080
一学期开除了两个学生

437

438
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:43,660
相信我  探员

你可以闭嘴了  我听不见你说什么
You might as well shut up. I can't hear you.

585
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:39,530
快点开门
Open the door!

586
01:14:57,890 --> 01:15:02,180
一座城市与六名鼓手

587
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:40,460
"电爱"
"Electric love"

588
01:15:47,190 --> 01:15:48,350
奥斯卡  开门
Oscar! Open up!

589
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:56,580
你他妈干什么呢
What the hell's going on?

590
01:15:58,010 --> 01:16:00,150
-天啊  瞧你这副模样  -你还好吗
- God, look at you! - How are you feeling?

591
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:02,120
小声点  你会把露西亚吵醒的
Be quiet! You'll wake Lucia.

592
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:05,690
我要写曲子  需要你帮我
I've got to write music. I need your help.

593
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:08,910
你是音盲  阿玛德斯
You are tone-deaf, Amadeus.

594
01:16:08,990 --> 01:16:10,880
我知道  但是
I know, but...

595
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:13,110
回家睡觉去  咱们以后再说吧
Go home and sleep. We'll talk later.

596
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:13,960
天啊
Christ!

597
01:16:17,430 --> 01:16:20,580
我要写曲子
I have to write music!

598
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:23,790
-看在上帝的份上  给我安静  -快点  动起来
- Be quiet, for Christ's sake! - Come on, let's go.

599
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:38,570
安静
Quiet!

600
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:55,830
首先是四分音符
First of all, there's the quarter note...

601
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:57,350
每个代表一拍
It's worth one beat in time.

602
01:16:58,210 --> 01:17:00,540
等等  你不用弹了  继续说
Wait, you don't have to play. Carry on.

603
01:17:02,710 --> 01:17:04,100
然后是二分音符
Then, there's the half note...

604
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:06,390
每个持续两拍
It lasts two beats.

605
01:17:06,910 --> 01:17:08,190
1  2
One, two...

606
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:09,240
好
Ok.

607
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,800
等等  哪个是哪个来着
Wait. Which one's which?

608
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:12,420
看着
Look!

609
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,770
四分音符  二分音符
Quarter note. Half note.

610
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:16,500
很好  这就够了
Good. That's all I need.

611
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,250
-什么  但  -靠边
- What? But... - Move over.

612
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:24,440
但你还需要知道别的音符和乐理
But there are other notes, other things you need to know.

613
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:25,550
比如音调还有拍号
Such as keys and time signatures...

614
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:27,550
可以了  可以了
This is perfect. This is perfect.

615
01:17:36,550 --> 01:17:37,490
你觉得怎么样
What do you think?

616
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:41,140
这什么都不是
But it's hardly anything!

617
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,990
但也是音乐吧
But is it music?

618
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:47,080
只要有音符就算音乐
It's got to be music or it won't work.

619
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:49,830
虽然是很烂的音乐
It's very bad music.

620
01:17:50,710 --> 01:17:51,590
但也算音乐吧
But it is music?

621
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:54,100
好的  谢了
Good. Thanks.

622
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:59,180
这首曲子会改变世界的
This music will change the world.

623
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:02,190
这话经常有人说
You're not the first to say that.

624
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,260
第四乐章

625
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:19,380

安德斯  往后点

628
01:19:35,630 --> 01:19:37,290
-再往前点  -就位
- Forward a touch. - Ready.

629
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:38,990
-就位  -就位
- Ready. - Ready!

630
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:43,070
1  2  3  4
One, two, three, four!

631
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:01,320
真棒

632
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:05,190
又是他
Him again?

633
01:22:05,690 --> 01:22:06,700
棒极了
Bravo!

634
01:22:08,170 --> 01:22:10,640
是谁写的曲子
Who's the composer?

635
01:22:11,140 --> 01:22:11,850
是那位
Is it...

636
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:15,010
戴着时髦眼镜的先生吗
the gentleman with the stylish glasses?

637
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:17,750
或许吧
Maybe.

638
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:19,130
谢谢你们的演出
Thanks for the concert.

639
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:22,600
谢谢你们各位
Thanks, all of you.

640
01:22:22,970 --> 01:22:26,120
那真是场绝妙的音乐体验
It really was a great musical experience!

641
01:22:27,190 --> 01:22:28,630
我说的是真心话
I really mean it.

642
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:29,730
你他妈到底想干吗
What the hell do you want?

643
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:30,600
我想干吗
What do I want?

644
01:22:35,410 --> 01:22:36,960
我给你写了首曲子
I've written music for you.

645
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:39,760
萨娜
Sanna!

646
01:22:41,150 --> 01:22:43,990
我需要你的帮助  你能下来吗
I'll need your help. Can you come down?

647
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:47,050

Why don't you come up here, you fascist pig?

648
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:50,410
不行  我们要一起演奏我的作品
No. We'll play my opus together.

649
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:55,080
你们四个在上面  萨娜和我在下面
You four up there, me and Sanna down here.

650
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:56,170
否则没法演
If not, it won't work.

651
01:22:59,310 --> 01:23:00,440
交给我吧
I'll take care of this.

652
01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:01,910
-我下去  -不行
- I'll go. - No!

653
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:03,050
我说行

654
01:23:04,230 --> 01:23:04,980
我去跟他谈谈
I'll talk to him.

655
01:23:06,330 --> 01:23:07,470
听好了  乐队
Listen up, orchestra.

656
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:09,570
我这儿有节拍器
Here's a metronome.

657
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,170
小心点儿  这是我父亲的
Be careful, it was my father's.

658
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:16,540
你们要一音不差地
You'll play my music

659
01:23:17,130 --> 01:23:19,480
演奏我写的曲子

665
01:23:32,230 --> 01:23:34,060
萨娜  抱歉

I'm gonna drum you to death, you fucking pig!

667
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:41,530
只要你们演奏我的曲子  我就放了萨娜
Play my music and I'll let Sanna go.

668
01:23:41,790 --> 01:23:44,820
二十分钟后准时通电

669
01:23:45,590 --> 01:23:46,520
萨娜

670
01:23:46,910 --> 01:23:48,560
我们会改变世界的

671
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:49,620
放开我
Let go of me!

672
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,820
我们到底在干什么
What the hell are we doing here?

673
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:14,320
一会儿就知道了
You'll see.

674
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:30,520
好了  我给你打开
Ok, I'm taking these off.

675
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:39,030
亏我还相信你
I trusted you!

676
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:41,770
萨娜  等等
Sanna! Wait!

677
01:24:42,930 --> 01:24:44,050
我需要你
I need you!

678
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:46,140

679
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:51,760
只有你能帮我
You're the only one who can help me...

680
01:24:53,870 --> 01:24:55,410
只有你能演奏这首曲子
who can play this piece.

681
01:24:59,150 --> 01:25:00,630
这曲子
I wrote this music.

682
01:25:01,030 --> 01:25:01,550
为你而写
For you.

683
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:05,890
给你
Here.

684
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:07,920
你来独奏
You're the soloist.

685
01:25:10,410 --> 01:25:11,690
如果你不愿意
I'll understand...

686
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:14,980
我也理解  但是
if you don't want to, but...

687
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:40,800
这是你写的吗
You wrote this?

688
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:44,750
是的
Yes.

689
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,920
这他妈什么玩意儿
What the hell is this?

690
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:52,120
该死的变态
Bloody sadist!

691
01:25:56,190 --> 01:25:57,810
你确定要这么做吗
Are you sure about this?

692
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:01,320
我觉得没事  但
I think it'll be ok. But...

693
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:05,140
你们千万不能碰到对方
make sure you don't touch each other.

694
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:08,480
下次选乐器的时候先考虑清楚
Next time, think twice before choosing your instruments.

695
01:26:09,450 --> 01:26:11,460
好了  咱们试试吧

696
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:47,960
好吧  该死的条子  为你演一个
Ok, you damn cop. This one's for you!

我的天啊  太难听了

这是我这辈子敲的最烂的曲子
It's the worst thing I've ever played in my life!

702
01:28:30,550 --> 01:28:31,050

一切归于宁静
Silence at last.

707
01:30:48,230 --> 01:30:49,320
再没有音乐
No more music.

708
01:31:17,390 --> 01:31:18,380
你得离开
You must leave.

709
01:31:19,050 --> 01:31:21,270
他们知道你的底细  他们知道所有事
They know who you are, they know everything.

710
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:25,680
走吧  越远越好
Leave and go far away.

711
01:31:37,420 --> 01:31:38,080
快走吧
Go now.

这也太掉价儿了

714
01:33:55,550 --> 01:33:57,530
但咱们总得挣钱糊口
We've got to make a living somehow.
