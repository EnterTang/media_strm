It's so good.

126
00:08:49,873 --> 00:08:51,738
-I want some fancy sauce.
-Yeah.
－我想要一些怪味醬。

Just one last spoonful.
再要最後一勺。

133
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:10,617
Hey, I think you've got
enough there, Brennan.
嘿，你那已經夠多了，布倫南。

134
00:09:12,196 --> 00:09:13,561
It's ketchup and mayonnaise.
這是番茄醬和蛋黃醬。

135
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,824
-I don't like it. It smells weird.
-Okay.
－我不喜歡，聞起來怪怪的。

-I'll try some.
-You want some?
－我要嘗一下。
－你想要嘗一下？

137
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:20,832
-Sure. Absolutely.
-Okay.
－當然。
－好。

138
00:09:21,171 --> 00:09:23,662
You don't mind, do you, Brennan?
No. Okay.
布倫南，你不介意吧？
不，好。

139
00:09:26,076 --> 00:09:27,737
-Brennan--
-I'm not comfortable--
－布倫南...
－我不舒服...

140
00:09:27,911 --> 00:09:30,106
It's okay. It's probably
not good on fish anyway.
沒事的。可能是魚吃的不舒服了。

141
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,181
My dad's king of the castle, so if he
wants fancy sauce, he should--
這是我爸的地盤，所以如果他想要怪味醬，他就應該...

142
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,910
-No, it's all right, Dale.
-He can make his own batch.
－不，沒關係的，戴爾。
－他可以自己做他那份。

143
00:09:36,086 --> 00:09:37,280
So you know what?
你知道嗎？

144
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,100
Today, when you were driving around,
Dale was telling me that he's really...
今天當你開車出去的時候，戴爾告訴我他非常...

145
00:09:42,526 --> 00:09:46,929
...into kung fu, and I was telling him
that you're really into kung fu as well.

146
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:50,990
I have a green belt.
我有一條綠腰帶。

147
00:09:51,735 --> 00:09:52,861
Read it and weep.
明白就哭去吧。

148
00:09:53,103 --> 00:09:54,934
I don't believe in belts.
我不相信腰帶等級。

149
00:09:55,205 --> 00:09:57,503
There should be no
ranking system for toughness.
健壯應該沒什麼等級。

150
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,973
But one time I wrestled a giraffe
to the ground with my bare hands.
但是一次我赤手空拳把一頭長頸鹿摔倒在地。

151
00:10:01,145 --> 00:10:03,238
That's not true, Dale.
Don't be ridiculous.
那不是真的，戴爾。
別荒唐了。

152
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,800
So, Dale, what have you been
working on recently?
那，戴爾，最近忙些什麼？

153
00:10:08,352 --> 00:10:09,580
Well...

00:10:10,788 --> 00:10:12,551
...I manage a baseball team.

155
00:10:13,524 --> 00:10:16,687
-Little League?
-Fantasy league.
－小聯盟？

156
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:26,934
Take a picture. It'll last longer.
拍張照片，那會持續的時間長些。

157
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:30,073
Why don't you stop
being so confrontational, Dale?
別再那麼有敵意了，戴爾。

158
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,867
I'm not the one staring at me.
盯著我看的不是我。

159
00:10:32,576 --> 00:10:34,100
So, Brennan, how about you?
布倫南，你呢？

160
00:10:34,545 --> 00:10:38,140
I know you used to
work at PetSmart.
我知道你過去在PetSmart工作。

161
00:10:38,782 --> 00:10:41,546
-That's right, Mr. Doback.
-Call me Robert.
－對了，多巴克先生。
－叫我羅伯特。

162
00:10:42,219 --> 00:10:45,120
-That's right, Robin.
-Robert.
－好的，羅賓。
－羅伯特。

163
00:10:45,489 --> 00:10:46,751
Robin.
羅賓。

164
00:10:47,891 --> 00:10:52,191
Actually, Brennan
is a really talented person.
事實上，布倫南是一個很有天賦的人。

165
00:10:52,596 --> 00:10:54,496
He's a very gifted singer.
他是一個很有天賦的歌手。

－我真的真的很不錯。

167
00:10:59,002 --> 00:11:02,267
I've been called
the songbird of my generation...
那些聽過我唱歌的人...

168
00:11:02,439 --> 00:11:04,566

That good.

170
00:11:05,943 --> 00:11:08,343
The only trick is
is that Brennan's very...
布倫南唯一的毛病就是他對...

171
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,741
...particular about
who he sings in front of, so....
...在誰面前唱非常挑剔，所以...

172
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:17,478
I'm his mom, for example,
I've only heard him sing twice.
比如，我是他母親，
但也只聽他唱過兩次。

173
00:11:17,654 --> 00:11:20,179
That's funny that you say that,
because I can sing too.
你說那太滑稽了，因為我也能唱。

00:11:20,357 --> 00:11:22,052
In fact, I'll sing right now.

（歌詞）這裡正開褲襠晚會

－住嘴！
－（歌詞：）你為什麼不舔舔我這裡？

179
00:11:32,402 --> 00:11:35,166
Stop it, Dale! Stop it! Stop it!
停，戴爾！停！停！

180
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:36,431

I remember when I had my first beer.
讓我想起了我第一次喝啤酒的時候。

很有趣，自從上次我從恐龍上摔下來後...

...I laughed so hard
I fell off my dinosaur.
...我就沒有笑的如此開心過。

閉嘴。好嗎？
讓我們都退一步。

185
00:11:47,117 --> 00:11:49,984
All right. Brennan, it's okay.
It's okay.
好了。布倫南，沒事了。
沒事了。

186
00:11:50,454 --> 00:11:51,853
Hey, hey.

187
00:11:52,022 --> 00:11:53,922

－是他先挑頭說的。

to give up his office drum set...
...因為戴爾不願意放棄他的練鼓房...

191

...that means that, Brennan, you and
Dale are gonna have to share a room.
...那就意味著，布倫南，你和戴爾將不得不共享一室。

192
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:11,508
-But it's just temporary.
-Mom, we didn't talk about this.
－但那只是暫時的。
－媽媽，你沒有給我說過這些。

Well, it's gonna be
an exciting adventure.
嗯，那將會是一次非常刺激的經歷。

This is my office
and my beat laboratory.

212
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,800

來看看我的房間。

221
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,300
Honey?

222
00:13:52,676 --> 00:13:55,907
I just found a chain of islands
that we can sail to after New Zealand.
我剛剛發現一些小島，
去過新西蘭以後我們航行到那裡。

00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,512
That's wonderful.

224
00:13:58,682 --> 00:14:02,243
You know,
I've been meaning to ask you....

Why is it that Dale never left?

226
00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:15,694
Well, Dale has always
coasted off my accomplishments.
嗯，戴爾一直都指望我的成就過活。

227
00:14:15,866 --> 00:14:17,891
I mean, he left college
his junior year...
我的意思是，他大三的時候退學...

to join the family business.

－但你是個醫生。
－相信我，我告訴過他。

230
00:14:25,108 --> 00:14:28,339

"It's all about who you know."
但他總是說：「我就是這個樣子」。

231
00:14:28,512 --> 00:14:30,946
I don't know where
he got this sense of entitlement.
我不知道他從哪得到的權利意識。

232
00:14:31,214 --> 00:14:34,308
Maybe it was his mother passing.
What about Brennan?
也許是從他媽那裡。
布倫南怎麼回事？

233
00:14:34,484 --> 00:14:35,951
From what you've told me...

been quite successful.

235
00:14:38,722 --> 00:14:42,123
Well, certainly when his father
and I split, that was difficult for him.
唔，無疑我和他父親的分手使他很難接受。

236
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,820
And this one time, when Brennan
was 1 7 and Derek was 1 4...
那時，布倫南17，德裡克14...

237
00:14:47,998 --> 00:14:50,899

to enter a talent show.
...布倫南決定要參加一個才能展示...

238
00:14:52,002 --> 00:14:55,904
He sang a song
from an old pirate musical.
他唱了一部老海盜音樂劇中的一首歌。

239
00:14:56,073 --> 00:15:00,976
But Derek got his football buddies
to replace the choir and sing:
但是德裡克和他的一幫足球哥們
代替了合唱團並唱到：

240
00:15:01,144 --> 00:15:03,044
"Brennan has a mangina."
「布倫南有個女人的下體。」

241

「布倫南有個女人的下體。」「布倫南有個女人的下體。」

242
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:13,380
Finally, the audience and even some
of the nastier parents started singing:
後來，觀眾，甚至一些惡意的父母也開始唱：

243
00:15:13,557 --> 00:15:15,218
"Brennan has a mangina."
「布倫南有個女人的下體。」

244
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:19,651
And I have to admit, for a little while,
I sort of joined in as well.
我必須承認，我也唱了一會。

245
