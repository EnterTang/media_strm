1
00:00:38,029 --> 00:00:39,818
All right, let's go.

2
00:00:45,232 --> 00:00:47,740
That's my main man Pierce
coming back from the war!

3
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:48,898
Thank you! Thank you, man.

4
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,068
Hey, what's happening, Jack?

5
00:01:08,392 --> 00:01:10,392
An unlicenced Club called
"The Blind Pig" serving
booze

6
00:01:14,363 --> 00:01:15,692
Private party.

7
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,609
Pick another card.

8
00:01:22,735 --> 00:01:24,113
There you go!

9
00:01:25,612 --> 00:01:27,490
I see what you're saying.

10
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,107
There we go!

11
00:01:32,775 --> 00:01:34,653
Damn it! Give me that shit.

12
00:01:36,071 --> 00:01:37,740
Party's over!

13
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,318
Here we go. Move on out.

14
00:01:39,358 --> 00:01:41,855
Move on out. Step out! Step out!

15
00:01:42,115 --> 00:01:44,153
Everybody out! Out!

16
00:01:44,613 --> 00:01:45,652
Let's go!

17
00:01:45,692 --> 00:01:47,989
I know you can hear me.
Get the fuck up and go!

18
00:01:48,029 --> 00:01:50,237
I don't care what you do
during the week. Get out!

19
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:54,523
Party's over! Let's
get it moving!

20
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,071
You know how this works!

21
00:01:56,111 --> 00:01:57,110
Says who?

22
00:01:58,948 --> 00:02:00,067
I'm sorry?

23
00:02:00,107 --> 00:02:01,736
Man, take a hike!

24
00:02:01,776 --> 00:02:03,903
Come in here smelling
like pig juice!

25
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:10,607
Excuse me, miss.
Thank you so much.

26
00:02:10,657 --> 00:02:11,736
What'd you say?

27
00:02:11,776 --> 00:02:13,484
I ain't said anybody
talking... Hey, man!

28
00:02:16,401 --> 00:02:19,238
Come on, man! Let me
go, man! Let me go!

29
00:02:22,565 --> 00:02:24,273
Hold on a second.

30
00:02:25,322 --> 00:02:28,399
Get the fuck out!
Get out! Get out!

31
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:30,816
How many times you
want me to say it?

32
00:02:30,856 --> 00:02:32,235
You're moving slow!

33
00:02:33,734 --> 00:02:35,232
Come on, man!

34
00:02:35,282 --> 00:02:36,990
Motherfuckers, man!

35
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:39,778
Look, Frank, man.
The owner split.

36
00:02:39,817 --> 00:02:41,276
Man, I'm sorry, but
you got a room

37
00:02:41,316 --> 00:02:43,064
full of open warrants
in there. All right?

38
00:02:43,114 --> 00:02:46,281
Just make sure you search the
women, you lazy bastard.

39
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,238
All right. Watch your eyes.

40
00:02:49,278 --> 00:02:50,277
Oh, shit!

41
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:54,573
You know that's not
right, brother!

42
00:02:56,571 --> 00:02:57,740
No, no, no!

43
00:03:01,736 --> 00:03:03,274
We gotta go through the front.

44
00:03:03,314 --> 00:03:05,821
What? You wanna take these
guys out in public, Sarge?

45
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:07,779
We have no fucking option.

46
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:09,238
- Go tell them. Run.
- All right.

47
00:03:11,236 --> 00:03:13,274
- You dirty pig!
- Get the fuck out of here.

48
00:03:15,282 --> 00:03:16,571
Anybody else?

49
00:03:16,611 --> 00:03:19,068
Why're we not moving?
You wanna go next?

50
00:03:19,108 --> 00:03:20,527
Out, out, out!

51
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,195
All right, party's
over, folks. Let's go!

52
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:23,733
You heard him. Time to move out!

53
00:03:23,773 --> 00:03:25,612
Put your drinks down
and step out the door.

54
00:03:25,652 --> 00:03:28,029
I do not understand, I
thought I was very clear!

55
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:29,528
Let's go! Come on!

56
00:03:29,568 --> 00:03:30,906
Out of here! Let's go! Come on!

57
00:03:30,946 --> 00:03:32,275
Congratulations.
Get the fuck out!

58
00:03:32,315 --> 00:03:34,273
How many times I gotta
say "Move out"?

59
00:03:34,323 --> 00:03:35,731
Let's go!

60
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:38,069
I know your black asses
is faster than that.

61
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:39,358
Go!

62
00:03:39,398 --> 00:03:41,486
Let's move! Come on!
Move! Let's go!

63
00:03:42,405 --> 00:03:44,273
On your feet! Move it! Let's go!

64
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,569
We're taking them out front.

65
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:50,027
Out the front door!
Let's go! Now!

66
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:51,236
Taking them out the front.

67
00:03:51,276 --> 00:03:52,615
Shit!

68
00:03:53,114 --> 00:03:54,113
Out the front!

69
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,069
Guys, sir, both sides.

70
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:00,736
Up against the wall.
Against the wall.

71
00:04:00,776 --> 00:04:02,155
Let's move it. Come on.

72
00:04:02,655 --> 00:04:03,654
Let's go!

73
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,108
Here we go. Squad's here.

74
00:04:10,107 --> 00:04:12,405
If they're not resisting,
don't push them.

75
00:04:15,781 --> 00:04:17,150
Put it right there.

76
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:20,946
Right here against the wall.

77
00:04:21,486 --> 00:04:22,774
Welcome home!

78
00:04:23,773 --> 00:04:24,902
Thank you, sir.

79
00:04:24,942 --> 00:04:26,780
Get out the way.
Get out the way!

80
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,738
Hands where we can see them.

81
00:04:28,778 --> 00:04:30,527
We had to use the front door.

82
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:32,814
- Shit!
- Make it a public display.

83
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,822
I almost feel bad for them.

84
00:04:35,322 --> 00:04:37,150
- We gotta get out of here.
- Quickly.

85
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,947
Let's go! Get them in!

86
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:41,606
All right! Start loading
them up! Let's go!

87
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,112
Okay, let's go!

88
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,569
Look at this shit!

89
00:04:49,608 --> 00:04:51,735
Let's hurry! Get it out of here!

90
00:04:52,065 --> 00:04:53,314
Get it out! Let's go!

91
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,238
Make sure we get those
guys at the back.

92
00:04:59,278 --> 00:05:00,946
What are you doing down
here all the time?

93
00:05:06,111 --> 00:05:07,570
We gotta get this moving!

94
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,738
Stop messing with us.

95
00:05:08,778 --> 00:05:10,107
These people didn't do a thing.

96
00:05:10,157 --> 00:05:11,406
Where's the other one?

97
00:05:11,446 --> 00:05:13,274
It should be here any minute.

98
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:14,573
What did they do?

99
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:16,321
Please calm down!
Everything's fine.

100
00:05:18,738 --> 00:05:19,947
Finally!

101
00:05:25,072 --> 00:05:26,191
Over here.

102
00:05:26,231 --> 00:05:28,778
This is our neighborhood.
You don't belong here.

103
00:05:28,818 --> 00:05:30,107
That's not necessary.

104
00:05:30,157 --> 00:05:31,316
Open the door! Get them in!

105
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:40,067
Arrests for a private gathering?

106
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:41,605
That's police overreach!

107
00:05:41,655 --> 00:05:43,733
You got no liquor
license on this place.

108
00:05:43,773 --> 00:05:45,362
Get the fuck out of my face.

109
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,777
- Let's just keep it calm.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

110
00:05:52,565 --> 00:05:55,781
Come on! Get in the damn
van! Step in there!

111
00:05:59,607 --> 00:06:00,606
Move, let's go!

112
00:06:01,106 --> 00:06:03,064
Let's get them
moving, gentlemen!

113
00:06:03,114 --> 00:06:06,071
Let's go! Get them in the wagon!

114
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,107
Hey, Dave! Told you you'd
get busted, you alcoholic!

115
00:06:10,407 --> 00:06:11,815
The night's not over!

116
00:06:14,323 --> 00:06:15,901
Go home! Go home!

117
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:17,240
Go home!

118
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,449
You go home!

119
00:06:23,653 --> 00:06:24,942
- Get them in.
- Last one.

120
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,109
Get them in!

121
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:29,607
You punk-ass motherfuckers!

122
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:34,902
Let's go, get in!

123
00:06:34,942 --> 00:06:36,281
Don't touch me!

124
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,449
Let's go! In!

125
00:06:38,489 --> 00:06:39,947
I'm moving!

126
00:06:39,987 --> 00:06:41,605
Get in! Let's go!

127
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,779
Get in the car! Let's go!

128
00:07:15,322 --> 00:07:16,900
Check this, motherfuckers!

129
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,107
Bub, can't even ride that bike!

130
00:07:40,407 --> 00:07:42,484
You know good and well you don't
know how to ride no bike.

131
00:07:44,772 --> 00:07:46,570
Do it, man! Throw it!

132
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,819
Catch this!

133
00:07:49,897 --> 00:07:51,985
Yeah! That's what
I'm talking about!

134
00:07:52,445 --> 00:07:54,273
It's show time now!

135
00:08:02,984 --> 00:08:05,402
<i>Destroyers striking from
as far as three miles away</i>

136
00:08:05,442 --> 00:08:07,779
<i>from this west side ghetto,</i>

137
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:10,197
<i>where it all began
early this morning</i>

138
00:08:10,237 --> 00:08:12,524
<i>with a police raid on an
after-hours drinking parlor.</i>

139
00:08:12,904 --> 00:08:15,192
<i>There have been some
reports of gunfire.</i>

140
00:08:15,232 --> 00:08:17,569
<i>Police are under
orders not to fire.</i>

141
00:08:17,609 --> 00:08:20,486
<i>More than 200 looters have
been arrested so far.</i>

142
00:08:20,736 --> 00:08:22,904
<i>Police officials say they
do not have enough men</i>

143
00:08:22,944 --> 00:08:24,442
<i>to worry much about the looters.</i>

144
00:08:24,482 --> 00:08:26,650
<i>They are there to
protect the firemen.</i>

145
00:08:28,448 --> 00:08:30,696
<i>But that is why you elected me.</i>

146
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:33,154
<i>To bring about change.</i>

147
00:08:34,273 --> 00:08:36,940
<i>But during this time,</i>

148
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,817
<i>it's important that
we all settle down.</i>

149
00:08:41,905 --> 00:08:44,023
<i>- Settle yourself!
- I know you're angry.</i>

150
00:08:44,073 --> 00:08:45,611
<i>I'm angry, too.</i>

151
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:48,778
<i>This city has problems,
especially with the policemen.</i>

152
00:08:48,818 --> 00:08:49,947
<i>We have problems.</i>

153
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:52,984
<i>However,</i>

154
00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:55,571
<i>change doesn't happen overnight.</i>

155
00:08:55,611 --> 00:08:58,069
<i>But change is coming.</i>

156
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,357
<i>Let's work together!</i>

157
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,944
Nah! Bring Stokely
Carmichael down here!

158
00:09:02,984 --> 00:09:04,862
We don't wanna hear
from your ass!

159
00:09:04,902 --> 00:09:08,069
<i>Look here. This is
what I need you to do!</i>

160
00:09:08,109 --> 00:09:11,565
<i>I need you to not mess up
your own neighborhood.</i>

161
00:09:11,615 --> 00:09:13,274
<i>This is your home!</i>

162
00:09:13,324 --> 00:09:14,612
Yeah, burn it down!

163
00:09:14,652 --> 00:09:16,650
<i>Burning it down is

I don't give a damn about
Ford Motor Company.

325
00:19:07,988 --> 00:19:09,527
Bumper cars and sheet
metal motherfucker?

326
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:10,736
You about to be with the stars!

327
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:13,023
But I need to buy bread, negro.

328
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,448
Listen, it's gonna be good.

329
00:19:20,196 --> 00:19:21,275
You sure?

330
00:19:21,315 --> 00:19:22,314
Yeah.

331
00:19:23,443 --> 00:19:24,442
All right?

332
00:19:25,281 --> 00:19:27,109
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

333
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:29,277
- I need you here, man.
- I'm here!

334
00:19:29,317 --> 00:19:31,565
What you need? Water
or something?

335
00:19:31,615 --> 00:19:34,282
<i>I know you're no good for me</i>

336
00:19:35,151 --> 00:19:37,359
<i>But you've become a part of me</i>

337
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:38,648
Is that A&R man out there?

338
00:19:38,698 --> 00:19:42,694
Yeah, he out there, waiting
to get his mind blown, baby.

339
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,237
<i>When it's so deep So deep</i>

340
00:19:50,026 --> 00:19:51,944
<i>Deep inside of me</i>

341
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:53,073
All right, folks, come on.

342
00:19:53,113 --> 00:19:54,152
Let's get this
together. You ready?

343
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:55,361
Get these steps together.

344
00:19:55,401 --> 00:19:56,819
Hold on. Let me get that
note one more time.

345
00:19:56,859 --> 00:19:58,358
<i>If you haven't got</i>

346
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:01,155
<i>Love</i>

347
00:20:02,274 --> 00:20:05,111
<i>Love</i>

348
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,527
<i>A traveling man once told me</i>

349
00:20:09,567 --> 00:20:11,655
<i>That he didn't ever care</i>

350
00:20:11,695 --> 00:20:13,073
Watch your spacing.

351
00:20:13,483 --> 00:20:16,989
<i>That any time he wants to go</i>

352
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:20,316
<i>That he go anywhere</i>

353
00:20:20,356 --> 00:20:24,941
<i>If you haven't got
love Love believe me</i>

354
00:20:25,611 --> 00:20:28,947
<i>The traveling man once told me</i>

355
00:20:28,987 --> 00:20:32,773
<i>If you haven't got love
Love will leave me</i>

356
00:20:32,823 --> 00:20:35,191
<i>Then you're lonely So lonely</i>

357
00:20:35,231 --> 00:20:37,649
<i>You're lonely So lonely</i>

358
00:20:37,698 --> 00:20:39,736
<i>You're lonely So lonely</i>

359
00:20:39,776 --> 00:20:41,904
<i>Oh, yeah If you haven't got</i>

360
00:20:48,148 --> 00:20:50,526
You're up next, boys.
Let's get it! Come on!

361
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,358
- It's Motown, baby.
- All right. Are we ready?

362
00:21:05,361 --> 00:21:06,779
Give it up!

363
00:21:09,237 --> 00:21:12,154
- Motown Records, baby.
- Motown, we're Motown tonight.

364
00:21:12,194 --> 00:21:14,362
<i>All right, settle down, cats.</i>

365
00:21:14,402 --> 00:21:15,900
<i>Now, I know you guys
think that we reached</i>

366
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,068
<i>the top of this evening
but we have not.</i>

367
00:21:18,108 --> 00:21:20,196
<i>Because we're about to take
this thing to another level.</i>

368
00:21:21,694 --> 00:21:24,861
<i>Because the band of brothers I'm
about to bring to this stage</i>

369
00:21:25,281 --> 00:21:27,778
<i>comes straight out of
Motor City herself.</i>

370
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,566
He talkin' about you.

371
00:21:31,235 --> 00:21:33,523
<i>If you would, stand
up on your feet</i>

372
00:21:33,573 --> 00:21:36,989
<i>and make some noise
for Detroit's own</i>

373
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,608
<i>The Dramatics!</i>

374
00:21:47,698 --> 00:21:50,026
You got to tell these folks that
they got to go home right now.

375
00:21:50,066 --> 00:21:51,155
These folks is out here rioting.

376
00:21:51,195 --> 00:21:52,484
Hold on. They're doin' what?

377
00:21:52,524 --> 00:21:53,613
They out here rioting.

378
00:21:53,652 --> 00:21:55,071
- Right now?
- Right now.

379
00:21:55,111 --> 00:21:56,440
Tell these folks
they got to go home.

380
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:57,648
<i>Excuse me.</i>

381
00:21:58,398 --> 00:21:59,487
We're ready, right?

382
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:00,775
Listen, you boys can't
go out there tonight.

383
00:22:00,815 --> 00:22:01,904
What do you mean we
can't go out there?

384
00:22:01,944 --> 00:22:03,023
These folks is out here rioting.

385
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:04,112
You cannot go out there tonight.

386
00:22:04,152 --> 00:22:05,191
We're on the schedule, brother.

387
00:22:05,231 --> 00:22:06,779
Well, y'all gotta get the
hell out of Fox tonight.

388
00:22:08,488 --> 00:22:10,985
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

389
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:12,863
<i>I'm afraid I have some bad news.</i>

390
00:22:13,772 --> 00:22:14,861
What's going on?

391
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:17,948
<i>It seems like we're all gonna
have to exit the building</i>

392
00:22:17,988 --> 00:22:19,317
<i>and head to our homes.</i>

393
00:22:19,357 --> 00:22:22,064
Come on, just one song,
man! Motown's right there!

394
00:22:22,114 --> 00:22:25,151
<i>This is Detroit, we're
no stranger to this.</i>

395
00:22:28,238 --> 00:22:31,065
<i>Now, the police said we have
absolutely nothing to worry about.</i>

396
00:22:31,115 --> 00:22:32,733
<i>So if you would, just
grab your things.</i>

397
00:22:32,773 --> 00:22:34,232
<i>Ma'am, grab your purse.</i>

398
00:22:34,282 --> 00:22:35,481
<i>Slowly, slowly.</i>

399
00:22:35,531 --> 00:22:36,939
<i>Exits to your left
and to your right.</i>

400
00:22:38,897 --> 00:22:40,905
- Damn it!
- What the hell?

401
00:22:41,365 --> 00:22:42,983
We gotta go, boys. We gotta go.

402
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,482
I'm going on that stage.

403
00:22:44,532 --> 00:22:45,570
We're going on that
stage, y'all hear me?

404
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,648
People are leaving, man.
The band's leaving.

405
00:22:47,698 --> 00:22:49,067
Ma'am, your purse.

406
00:22:49,107 --> 00:22:50,695
We won't get another
shot like this.

407
00:22:50,735 --> 00:22:51,774
I'm sorry.

408
00:22:51,814 --> 00:22:53,113
We need to get out
of here, Larry.

409
00:22:53,153 --> 00:22:54,821
Watch your step, sir!

410
00:22:56,569 --> 00:22:58,398
Now, boys, I'm sorry.
But we've got to go.

411
00:22:58,448 --> 00:22:59,856
- I'm sorry.
- All right.

412
00:23:01,485 --> 00:23:03,113
Larry, I mean...

413
00:23:03,153 --> 00:23:04,532
What can we do?

414
00:23:07,489 --> 00:23:09,317
Larry, there's
nothing we can do.

415
00:23:10,196 --> 00:23:12,314
Another day... Another day, man.

416
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:20,526
Listen, I know you
want it bad, man.

417
00:23:22,773 --> 00:23:24,072
Larry, we gotta go.

418
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:25,151
We gotta go.

419
00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:28,278
Come on.

420
00:23:28,318 --> 00:23:29,447
Larry!

421
00:23:37,069 --> 00:23:38,278
Larry.

422
00:23:48,398 --> 00:23:51,984
<i>You might be a rich man</i>

423
00:23:52,024 --> 00:23:55,401
<i>With the world on a string</i>

424
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,606
<i>But with all your riches</i>

425
00:23:59,656 --> 00:24:03,273
<i>You haven't got everything</i>

426
00:24:03,323 --> 00:24:07,528
<i>If you haven't got love</i>

427
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,775
<i>Love</i>

428
00:24:10,815 --> 00:24:15,650
<i>If you haven't got
love Ooh, love</i>

429
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,068
<i>You're lonely</i>

430
00:24:18,318 --> 00:24:20,156
<i>You're lonely</i>

431
00:24:20,406 --> 00:24:22,483
<i>So lonely</i>

432
00:24:22,523 --> 00:24:24,901
<i>Ooh, baby</i>

433
00:24:31,864 --> 00:24:33,403
We were so close.

434
00:24:34,192 --> 00:24:36,440
Yeah, y'all looked good,
y'all sounded good.

435
00:24:36,689 --> 00:24:38,448
There'll be a next time.

436
00:24:39,407 --> 00:24:40,446
There will be.

437
00:24:49,486 --> 00:24:50,695
Bus driver!

438
00:24:52,064 --> 00:24:53,902
Hey, now! Bus driver!

439
00:25:02,274 --> 00:25:03,862
Hey, y'all seeing this?

440
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:07,698
<i>Clear the street.</i>

441
00:25:07,738 --> 00:25:09,407
<i>Go back to your homes now.</i>

442
00:25:12,364 --> 00:25:15,480
<i>Disperse or you
will be arrested.</i>

443
00:25:17,818 --> 00:25:20,356
I say we go up to 12th Street
and be a part of this.

444
00:25:20,775 --> 00:25:22,693
We're working musicians, man.

445
00:25:23,363 --> 00:25:26,689
I can't be singing when I'm supposed
to be out there swinging, brother.

446
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:29,357
Hey, look. We're not too
far from the Algiers.

447
00:25:29,406 --> 00:25:30,905
Let's just go there till
all this blows over.

448
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,859
We gotta get off this bus!

449
00:25:36,899 --> 00:25:38,567
Everybody out! Let's go, now!

450
00:25:46,489 --> 00:25:48,737
- Come on, man!
- Sit the fuck down!

451
00:25:50,196 --> 00:25:51,235
I didn't do anything!

452
00:25:51,564 --> 00:25:54,901
I'm sorry, I've been working straight
shifts since the riots started.

453
00:25:54,941 --> 00:25:56,989
Yeah, that guy you shot
at didn't make it home.

454
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:59,446
Ambulance found him
bleeding out under a car.

455
00:26:02,823 --> 00:26:04,362
Are we sure it's the same guy?

456
00:26:04,401 --> 00:26:06,360
He's the only Virginia
Park shooting today.

457
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:08,318
You carry a shotgun,
he had shotgun wounds.

458
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,906
You wanna play ballistics?

459
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,031
Jesus Christ, I'm sorry.

460
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,360
That's it?

461
00:26:18,148 --> 00:26:19,237
What else?

462
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:20,815
You shot him in the back.

463
00:26:22,573 --> 00:26:24,901
Right. He was... He was
running away from me.

464
00:26:24,941 --> 00:26:26,529
Where else do you
want me to shoot?

465
00:26:27,488 --> 00:26:30,905
My point was him being
no threat to you.

466
00:26:32,693 --> 00:26:34,901
In hindsight, but I'm thinking,

467
00:26:34,941 --> 00:26:37,698
why is he running away from me, if
all he did was steal some groceries?

468
00:26:37,948 --> 00:26:41,115
What if he killed somebody
in that grocery store?

469
00:26:41,155 --> 00:26:43,023
He's avoiding the police.
What do you assume from that?

470
00:26:43,073 --> 00:26:44,361
You don't assume.

471
00:26:44,401 --> 00:26:46,399
If he had a weapon in his
hand, that's another story.

472
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:48,487
We don't shoot for robberies.

473
00:26:49,446 --> 00:26:53,113
Detective, you know it's a
war zone out there, right?

474
00:26:54,611 --> 00:26:57,778
Yeah. 10th had to shut down.

475
00:26:58,148 --> 00:26:59,776
They're destroying the city.

476
00:27:01,195 --> 00:27:04,112
We're facilitating that
with the message we send,

477
00:27:04,731 --> 00:27:07,738
which is that it's okay, go
ahead, burn down your houses,

478
00:27:07,778 --> 00:27:09,197
rob a store.

479
00:27:09,856 --> 00:27:11,654
It's total chaos. And...

480
00:27:12,943 --> 00:27:15,490
Where does that lead us
long term, Detective?

481
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,568
All right, kid. Thank you.

482
00:27:21,564 --> 00:27:22,573
Anytime.

483
00:27:22,613 --> 00:27:24,401
I'm recommending murder charges.

484
00:27:25,191 --> 00:27:27,778
You go back to work, wait
to hear from the DA.

485
00:27:30,196 --> 00:27:31,235
Yes, sir.

486
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:32,323
And kid...

487
00:27:34,032 --> 00:27:35,280
Calm down out there.

488
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,239
Thank you, Detective.

489
00:27:43,482 --> 00:27:44,651
All right?

490
00:27:44,691 --> 00:27:45,780
Forget about it.

491
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,948
- Are you in trouble?
- I'm fine, so forget it.

492
00:27:48,198 --> 00:27:50,156
He's doing his job,
same as you and me.

493
00:27:50,905 --> 00:27:53,522
Stand up. Let's
go. On your feet.

494
00:28:02,863 --> 00:28:06,359
Go home, now! All you
people, off the streets.

495
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:07,988
Yo, we need to split up, man.

496
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:10,775
I mean, the police are going
crazy out here right now.

497
00:28:11,115 --> 00:28:13,402
Five brothers together, you
know they gonna say we a gang.

498
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:15,280
Come on, man, we're
not splitting up.

499
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,319
Shit!

500
00:28:16,739 --> 00:28:18,198
Where do you think you're going?

501
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,315
- We're going home, man.
- Get off the street!

502
00:28:20,355 --> 00:28:21,694
Hands on the wall!

503
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:22,983
- Keep them up!
- Okay!

504
00:28:23,652 --> 00:28:24,651
Oh, shit!

505
00:28:28,487 --> 00:28:29,776
Keep moving!

506
00:28:29,816 --> 00:28:30,905
What the hell you talking about?

507
00:28:30,945 --> 00:28:31,984
Look at this mess, man!

508
00:28:32,024 --> 00:28:33,942
Hey, come here! You!
Stop! It's after curfew!

509
00:28:33,982 --> 00:28:36,439
<i>This is the Detroit Police.
There is a curfew.</i>

510
00:28:36,489 --> 00:28:37,528
We're going home!

511
00:28:37,568 --> 00:28:39,107
<i>Assalamu alaikum, my brother!</i>

512
00:28:39,157 --> 00:28:40,235
<i>Disperse!</i>

513
00:28:40,275 --> 00:28:42,074
<i>Leave using the
streets behind you.</i>

514
00:28:42,114 --> 00:28:43,402
<i>This direction!</i>

515
00:28:45,151 --> 00:28:46,689
This is our street!

516
00:28:46,739 --> 00:28:48,817
<i>Go back to your homes!</i>

517
00:28:48,857 --> 00:28:51,115
<i>Go back to your homes!</i>

518
00:28:55,071 --> 00:28:56,239
<i>Disperse</i>

519
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:57,568
<i>or you will be arrested.</i>

520
00:29:19,946 --> 00:29:21,234
Hello, hello.

521
00:29:21,274 --> 00:29:22,273
Hello.

522
00:29:22,323 --> 00:29:24,651
How you doing? Just
need to get a room.

523
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:26,359
Y'all at the wrong
hotel, though.

524
00:29:26,779 --> 00:29:28,487
Ritz down the street.

525
00:29:29,486 --> 00:29:31,734
Yeah, well, the Ritz ain't got
you behind the counter, so...

526
00:29:31,774 --> 00:29:36,030
Look, all I got is a room in the annex
out back down through the breezeway.

527
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:38,317
$11 a night, you pay in advance.

528
00:29:38,357 --> 00:29:39,526
That's cool.

529
00:30:34,531 --> 00:30:36,359
A8, A8.

530
00:30:44,072 --> 00:30:45,110
<i>Voila!</i>

531
00:30:47,198 --> 00:30:48,527
What you expect for 11 bucks?

532
00:30:57,528 --> 00:30:58,697
Hey!

533
00:30:58,737 --> 00:31:00,615
<i>With the exception of a
few isolated snipers...</i>

534
00:31:00,655 --> 00:31:02,733
You know what fucking
time it is, boy?

535
00:31:02,773 --> 00:31:05,110
- Let me have a little fun with you.
- Come on, man!

536
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,689
- What time is it?
- I ain't got no watch.

537
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:07,948
How am I supposed to
know what time it is?

538
00:31:07,988 --> 00:31:09,566
It's past curfew and you
know it, Goddamn it!

539
00:31:09,606 --> 00:31:11,064
You gonna shoot me because
I don't have a watch?

540
00:31:11,114 --> 00:31:12,113
Get the fuck off my street!

541
00:31:12,153 --> 00:31:14,361
- What you gonna do? Shoot me?
- Get off my street!

542
00:31:14,401 --> 00:31:15,440
Do it! Go ahead.

543
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,569
I will kill you
right the fuck now.

544
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:17,988
So sorry!

545
00:31:18,028 --> 00:31:20,695
I'm guarding that grocery store
right there. I'm guarding it.

546
00:31:20,735 --> 00:31:23,572
This my nephew. I'm so
sorry, I apologize.

547
00:31:23,612 --> 00:31:25,860
I'm gonna take him
away. Come on.

548
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,358
I ain't your nephew,
motherfucker!

549
00:31:27,398 --> 00:31:30,275
Just get across the
street. Calm down.

550
00:31:30,315 --> 00:31:32,943
- They let you out, Uncle Tom?
- Just get across the street.

551
00:31:33,862 --> 00:31:35,820
Keep on walking.
Don't look back.

552
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,198
Keep on moving.

553
00:31:38,777 --> 00:31:40,315
Dumb jacky giant,

554
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:42,823
I'll beat your head
to the white meat.

555
00:31:43,232 --> 00:31:45,070
You won't kick my ass.

556
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:47,898
I'm a black belt in karate,
I'll whoop that ass.

557
00:31:48,947 --> 00:31:51,064
Besides, even if you did win,

558
00:31:51,734 --> 00:31:54,281
those ten guys over
there would be on you

559
00:31:54,321 --> 00:31:56,279
and behind them is 10,000.

560
00:31:56,779 --> 00:31:59,236
Now, you smart. Go home.

561
00:32:09,066 --> 00:32:10,405
So you the cool brother, huh?

562
00:32:12,403 --> 00:32:13,652
Dismukes.

563
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,028
Okay, Tom.

564
00:32:19,816 --> 00:32:21,314
<i>This is the Detroit Police.</i>

565
00:32:21,364 --> 00:32:22,613
<i>There is a curfew.</i>

566
00:32:22,653 --> 00:32:24,401
<i>You cannot stay on the street.</i>

567
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,568
What the hell was that?

568
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:29,736
You checked the
windows and doors?

569
00:32:29,776 --> 00:32:32,023
- I checked them already.
- Check it again.

570
00:32:32,073 --> 00:32:34,071
I don't even wanna see
graffiti back there.

571
00:32:38,197 --> 00:32:39,196
Hello.

572
00:32:40,615 --> 00:32:42,653
Everything is fine.
No trouble here.

573
00:32:44,031 --> 00:32:46,569
I'll sleep when they stop
rioting. Good night, sir.

574
00:32:49,906 --> 00:32:52,073
Hey, hey. Hey. Look at this.

575
00:33:01,404 --> 00:33:04,531
Miller, with me. Ready,
Title 32? Let's do it!

576
00:33:04,571 --> 00:33:05,780
You got it!

577
00:33:06,069 --> 00:33:07,198
You know what?

578
00:33:07,898 --> 00:33:09,985
I'm gonna go talk to
those white guys.

579
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:12,323
I'm gonna stay here,
if that's okay.

580
00:33:12,363 --> 00:33:14,901
I'm gonna make sure they
don't start shooting at us.

581
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,819
All right, boys.

582
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,697
Relax here.

583
00:33:21,234 --> 00:33:22,863
Hey, you sure you
want them white boys

584
00:33:22,903 --> 00:33:24,531
- to know where we are?
- I'll be right back.

585
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,778
Jefferson, Wood, head in
there and take the roof.

586
00:33:37,818 --> 00:33:38,817
We're on it.

587
00:33:40,944 --> 00:33:42,363
Hey, fellas.

588
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:43,981
Melvin Dismukes.

589
00:33:44,441 --> 00:33:45,570
I'm with United Security,

590
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:47,568
I'm guarding that grocery
store across the street.

591
00:33:47,898 --> 00:33:49,656
I come bearing gifts.

592
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:50,775
Thank you.

593
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,321
Isn't this nice, boys?

594
00:33:57,738 --> 00:34:00,065
All things considered,
this is pretty good.

595
00:34:00,115 --> 00:34:03,072
Thank you. I don't have
my usual appliances.

596
00:34:04,571 --> 00:34:05,939
You got any sugar?

597
00:34:07,238 --> 00:34:08,986
Don't push it, man.

598
00:34:12,073 --> 00:34:13,232
It's good to have some quiet.

599
00:34:14,031 --> 00:34:15,780
We were at Black
Bottom earlier today.

600
00:34:16,359 --> 00:34:18,027
We actually took sniper fire.

601
00:34:18,317 --> 00:34:20,525
Had one, right by here.

602
00:34:20,984 --> 00:34:23,532
Ain't no snipers here,
man. Just you and me

603
00:34:23,572 --> 00:34:25,650
and the people partying
in that motel.

604
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,487
How long do you think
this is gonna last?

605
00:34:28,527 --> 00:34:33,732
Yeah, how long till these
negros, people, quit?

606
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:35,150
What do you think?

607
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,648
How the hell am I
supposed to know?

608
00:34:38,447 --> 00:34:40,065
Is Morris home? It's Larry.

609
00:34:42,193 --> 00:34:44,361
I can't find those
guys anywhere.

610
00:34:44,401 --> 00:34:46,319
No, no, no. No, he's fine.

611
00:34:46,948 --> 00:34:49,776
Just when you see that cat, tell
him to come down to the Algiers.

612
00:34:49,816 --> 00:34:51,404
We're rehearsing.

613
00:34:51,444 --> 00:34:52,443
Bye.

614
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,149
No luck?

615
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,607
His mama don't even
know where he is.

616
00:35:02,113 --> 00:35:03,612
He's probably all right.

617
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:09,406
<i>Look in my eyes</i>

618
00:35:09,446 --> 00:35:11,364
<i>And don't you see water?</i>

619
00:35:11,404 --> 00:35:14,361
<i>And it's all because of you</i>

620
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,699
<i>So look at me</i>

621
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,777
<i>I ain't acting like I ought to</i>

622
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:21,614
<i>And it's all because of you</i>

623
00:35:22,862 --> 00:35:26,189
<i>So look in my eyes And
don't you see water?</i>

624
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:28,527
<i>And it's all because of you</i>

625
00:35:28,567 --> 00:35:30,944
You're gonna get
back on that stage.

626
00:35:31,774 --> 00:35:33,612
Yeah, it's not that
simple, brother.

627
00:35:34,111 --> 00:35:37,648
Listen, when they hear you
blow... Money raining.

628
00:35:39,316 --> 00:35:40,615
And I want a cut.

629
00:35:46,439 --> 00:35:47,648
Look at me.

630
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:49,656
In the eyes.

631
00:35:51,064 --> 00:35:52,982
I'm looking at you
in the eyes, Fred.

632
00:35:53,612 --> 00:35:56,029
You're gonna get a record deal.

633
00:35:56,739 --> 00:35:57,738
All right?

634
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,115
<i>Look in my eyes</i>

635
00:36:01,194 --> 00:36:02,653
The Fox Theatre

636
00:36:03,072 --> 00:36:05,190
welcomes The Dramatics!

637
00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:07,068
Yeah?

638
00:36:07,318 --> 00:36:08,527
Yeah.

639
00:36:12,113 --> 00:36:13,482
You know what, Fred?

640
00:36:13,532 --> 00:36:15,690
I think it's time to fix that
little problem of yours.

641
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,358
What problem?

642
00:36:17,398 --> 00:36:19,775
- I don't have a problem.
- Yeah, you do. Come on.

643
00:36:19,815 --> 00:36:21,903
- We're not doing this.
- Yeah, we're doing this.

644
00:36:21,943 --> 00:36:23,152
Come on! Don't give me a no.

645
00:36:23,192 --> 00:36:24,231
Come on.

646
00:36:24,281 --> 00:36:25,320
<i>You're gonna look in her eyes</i>

647
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,399
I don't need it,
I don't want it.

648
00:36:26,439 --> 00:36:27,528
<i>And she's gonna get you off</i>

649
00:36:27,568 --> 00:36:28,607
Come on.

650
00:36:30,315 --> 00:36:32,653
Okay, no. Man, I'm doing
you a favor, okay?

651
00:36:33,322 --> 00:36:34,531
- Okay?
- I'm going.

652
00:36:34,571 --> 00:36:35,570
We're going.

653
00:36:36,818 --> 00:36:38,527
Look at this nice little
scene right here.

654
00:36:40,655 --> 00:36:42,523
- There you go, Karen.
- Thank you.

655
00:36:42,573 --> 00:36:45,530
Enjoy it because we are
now officially broke.

656
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:49,735
There's rioting outside, and I'm
not writing to my parents again.

657
00:36:54,071 --> 00:36:56,239
Look at this. That right there.

658
00:36:56,778 --> 00:36:57,777
It's perfect.

659
00:36:57,817 --> 00:36:59,196
- Larry.
- What?

660
00:36:59,236 --> 00:37:00,615
They white.

661
00:37:00,655 --> 00:37:01,983
So, they white.

662
00:37:02,023 --> 00:37:04,151
Beggars can't be
choosers, all right?

663
00:37:06,189 --> 00:37:07,448
What does that mean?

664
00:37:07,488 --> 00:37:08,527
You know what I say?

665
00:37:08,567 --> 00:37:09,566
What?

666
00:37:10,525 --> 00:37:12,023
Let freedom ring.

667
00:37:13,112 --> 00:37:15,570
I've had that freedom,
thank you very much!

668
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:17,028
No, you haven't.

669
00:37:18,067 --> 00:37:22,023
Because freedom doesn't mean
giving it away for free.

670
00:37:23,362 --> 00:37:26,239
Only you could make
prostitution sound high class.

671
00:37:26,609 --> 00:37:27,737
Come on.

672
00:37:27,777 --> 00:37:29,526
I'm not trying to
do this, brother.

673
00:37:29,566 --> 00:37:30,615
Hey, stop.

674
00:37:30,655 --> 00:37:32,113
Why won't you just
leave them alone?

675
00:37:32,153 --> 00:37:33,821
I think those boys
are eyeballing us.

676
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,189
Okay, stop.

677
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:38,317
Come on, man. Follow my lead.

678
00:37:38,816 --> 00:37:42,233
Okay, so we do it together
and it's like a co-op.

679
00:37:42,523 --> 00:37:45,530
Excuse me, ladies.
I'm Larry Cleveland.

680
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:48,657
I wouldn't be interrupting a private
conversation here, would I?

681
00:37:48,906 --> 00:37:50,615
We must be neighbors.

682
00:37:50,655 --> 00:37:52,523
I'm Julie, Ohio.

683
00:37:53,152 --> 00:37:55,280
Karen, Ohio.

684
00:37:55,939 --> 00:37:59,156
No, my last name is Cleveland.

685
00:38:00,694 --> 00:38:02,822
We're actually from Ohio.

686
00:38:04,151 --> 00:38:06,489
Okay, so what y'all
doing in Detroit?

687
00:38:06,529 --> 00:38:08,816
Well, Julie here is a
professional prostitute.

688
00:38:08,856 --> 00:38:10,694
- Okay...
- She's kidding!

689
00:38:11,773 --> 00:38:12,982
I'm a hairdresser.

690
00:38:13,232 --> 00:38:14,361
And a hoe.

691
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,238
What do you guys do?

692
00:38:19,945 --> 00:38:21,773
I'm a singer in The Dramatics,

693
00:38:21,823 --> 00:38:23,861
and Fred here is my bodyguard.

694
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:24,990
The Dramatics?

695
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,069
Yeah.

696
00:38:26,109 --> 00:38:27,238
Never heard of them.

697
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:31,484
But I love... I love Motown.

698
00:38:32,403 --> 00:38:34,231
The Supremes are my favorite.

699
00:38:34,531 --> 00:38:38,197
Well, if you love The Supremes,
you'll definitely love The Dramatics.

700
00:38:38,906 --> 00:38:40,025
Larry.

701
00:38:40,734 --> 00:38:42,073
Sing something to her.

702
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:46,569
<i>Baby</i>

703
00:38:47,488 --> 00:38:50,155
<i>I'm for real</i>

704
00:38:50,654 --> 00:38:54,281
<i>I said I'm as real
As real can get</i>

705
00:38:56,319 --> 00:38:58,407
Oh, my God! He can really sing.

706
00:38:59,026 --> 00:39:01,404
It's who I am, you know. I sing.

707
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:03,442
It's who he is.

708
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:08,656
We were just gonna go
get something to eat.

709
00:39:09,486 --> 00:39:11,863
A friend of ours is
staying at the annex.

710
00:39:12,153 --> 00:39:13,611
Would you like to join us?

711
00:39:14,361 --> 00:39:16,109
I mean, yeah. I could eat.

712
00:39:16,149 --> 00:39:17,358
Fred, you hungry?

713
00:39:18,157 --> 00:39:20,065
Yeah, I can eat.

714
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:21,983
Let's go.

715
00:39:23,072 --> 00:39:24,111
Let's go.

716
00:39:27,607 --> 00:39:28,736
How you doing?

717
00:39:28,776 --> 00:39:29,865
Good.

718
00:39:30,525 --> 00:39:31,903
How are you?

719
00:39:43,112 --> 00:39:44,940
We looking good!

720
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,778
Hey, Carl!

721
00:39:47,567 --> 00:39:49,066
We're starving.

722
00:39:51,234 --> 00:39:52,523
You know I got something
for y'all to eat.

723
00:39:52,572 --> 00:39:53,781
Okay.

724
00:39:53,821 --> 00:39:55,530
- Hey, babe.
- Hey!

725
00:39:57,448 --> 00:39:58,606
Hello!

726
00:40:01,114 --> 00:40:02,153
Hi, guys!

727
00:40:03,482 --> 00:40:04,610
Come on in.

728
00:40:07,737 --> 00:40:09,026
It's a nice joint, man.

729
00:40:11,444 --> 00:40:12,612
Sit down, man.

730
00:40:13,651 --> 00:40:14,780
Say what?

731
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,279
Sit down, take a seat.

732
00:40:18,736 --> 00:40:19,815
Hey, Aubrey.

733
00:40:20,564 --> 00:40:22,113
How you doing?

734
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:23,362
Hey, Karen.

735
00:40:32,862 --> 00:40:35,569
Okay, where I grew up,
when you meet someone new,

736
00:40:36,029 --> 00:40:38,696
you're supposed to
say "Hi, hello!"

737
00:40:39,735 --> 00:40:41,234
"How are you?"

738
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,232
It makes them feel comfortable.

739
00:40:46,488 --> 00:40:47,897
Nice duds, man.

740
00:40:49,316 --> 00:40:50,944
Thanks, man, I appreciate it.

741
00:40:50,984 --> 00:40:52,772
We were performing earlier.

742
00:40:53,442 --> 00:40:54,480
Watch out.

743
00:40:56,279 --> 00:40:57,647
Total bull.

744
00:40:57,897 --> 00:40:59,815
This guy. Okay.

745
00:41:00,445 --> 00:41:02,403
Food is served right there.

746
00:41:03,981 --> 00:41:05,240
Yeah, all right, man.

747
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,279
Hey, Julie,

748
00:41:06,778 --> 00:41:09,236
the air conditioning's
real nice over here.

749
00:41:09,276 --> 00:41:10,405
Real nice, huh?

750
00:41:10,445 --> 00:41:12,153
The bed's comfortable, too.

751
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:37,148
- Yeah, that's nice.
- Yeah?

752
00:41:39,815 --> 00:41:41,943
Maybe roll up one
of these joints.

753
00:41:53,731 --> 00:41:56,109
Aubrey, man, turn that radio up.

754
00:42:18,486 --> 00:42:19,655
Come on, fellas, please.

755
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:26,069
Can we please let Trane speak?

756
00:42:26,448 --> 00:42:28,107
What the hell?

757
00:42:40,734 --> 00:42:42,233
That's beautiful.

758
00:42:43,731 --> 00:42:45,779
So sad that he died.

759
00:42:45,819 --> 00:42:47,527
He was young, right?

760
00:42:47,567 --> 00:42:48,566
He was 40.

761
00:42:49,565 --> 00:42:50,904
But he used his years.

762
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:52,113
Let me tell you, that man lived.

763
00:42:53,481 --> 00:42:55,240
Unfortunately, it was heroin.

764
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,816
Now, we know Trane
did not overdose.

765
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:00,734
Don't put a rumor on that, man.

766
00:43:01,903 --> 00:43:04,071
I didn't say Trane overdosed.

767
00:43:04,111 --> 00:43:06,279
But John Coltrane was
a junkie for years.

768
00:43:06,738 --> 00:43:09,236
Love Supreme Trane
was high on dope.

769
00:43:09,276 --> 00:43:10,734
I'm not saying that's
taking anything away

770
00:43:10,774 --> 00:43:12,023
from the man as a
spiritual example.

771
00:43:12,073 --> 00:43:13,611
He's one of my many saints.

772
00:43:13,651 --> 00:43:15,110
But heroin is what
killed his liver.

773
00:43:16,448 --> 00:43:18,736
I heard the FBI poisoned him.

774
00:43:18,776 --> 00:43:20,524
FBI. You wanna know how I know?

775
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:22,652
John Coltrane's wife
is a Detroit musician,

776
00:43:22,942 --> 00:43:24,231
same set as me.

777
00:43:24,281 --> 00:43:26,858
So now you a trained
expert on Coltrane?

778
00:43:29,945 --> 00:43:33,781
<i>Continuing coverage tonight of
the rioting here in Detroit.</i>

779
00:43:33,821 --> 00:43:37,068
<i>The National Guard
has been called in</i>

780
00:43:37,108 --> 00:43:41,234
<i>and more than 3,200 people have
been arrested, most of them negros.</i>

781
00:43:41,274 --> 00:43:43,651
<i>Updates will continue
throughout our broadcast...</i>

782
00:43:43,691 --> 00:43:45,529
Why is everything
always so violent?

783
00:43:47,487 --> 00:43:49,156
You ask your people that?

784
00:43:50,314 --> 00:43:52,612
Try a little revolution
with the English,

785
00:43:52,652 --> 00:43:55,569
all that "liberty or death"?

786
00:43:55,609 --> 00:43:57,777
That ain't so
non-violent at all.

787
00:43:58,157 --> 00:43:59,735
Man, she from Ohio.

788
00:43:59,775 --> 00:44:03,112
I highly doubt she understands your
logic about liberty and death.

789
00:44:06,109 --> 00:44:07,527
Well, let's put it
in layman's terms.

790
00:44:07,567 --> 00:44:08,816
Slide over, stripes.

791
00:44:10,484 --> 00:44:11,483
You see,

792
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:13,731
you white, ain't you?

793
00:44:14,191 --> 00:44:15,280
Brother.

794
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,448
You white, right?

795
00:44:17,607 --> 00:44:20,564
See, y'all don't have to deal with
the police nearly as much as we do.

796
00:44:20,614 --> 00:44:22,362
Unless, of course, you're some

797
00:44:22,402 --> 00:44:24,900
Uncle Tom handkerchief
head, you know?

798
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:26,778
It's like... When you're
black, it's almost like

799
00:44:26,818 --> 00:44:28,986
having a gun pointing
right at your face.

800
00:44:30,235 --> 00:44:31,443
You understand that?

801
00:44:33,781 --> 00:44:34,860
It's like this.

802
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,907
Hey, boy! Get your
hands off my plate.

803
00:44:37,947 --> 00:44:41,234
Put the hot dog... Step
away from the mustard!

804
00:44:41,273 --> 00:44:44,900
Put your hands down!
Don't... You nervous?

805
00:44:45,279 --> 00:44:47,567
- You're making me nervous!
- You got a gun on me.

806
00:44:47,607 --> 00:44:49,945
This like police brutality
or something, man.

807
00:44:49,985 --> 00:44:52,732
So you gonna tell me
how to do my job now?

808
00:44:52,782 --> 00:44:54,990
- I'm not...
- So now you're the police officer

809
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:57,068
that tells me how to do
my job on my street?

810
00:44:57,108 --> 00:44:59,066
What you doing on
my street, nigger?

811
00:44:59,106 --> 00:45:01,943
See, that's the way they
like to express themselves.

812
00:45:02,402 --> 00:45:04,400
You know, "My street,
my house, my car."

813
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,109
That way they can take
everything from you.

814
00:45:06,149 --> 00:45:07,607
- Larry.
- So again.

815
00:45:08,157 --> 00:45:10,564
What you doing on
my street, boy?

816
00:45:10,614 --> 00:45:12,442
Did I do something
wrong, officer?

817
00:45:13,571 --> 00:45:15,569
Did you do something wrong?

818
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:18,606
I ought to blow your
head right off.

819
00:45:19,156 --> 00:45:20,774
Get that gun off me, man.

820
00:45:21,653 --> 00:45:23,571
- Or what, boy?
- I said, get that gun off...

821
00:45:25,439 --> 00:45:26,568
Oh, my God!

822
00:45:26,608 --> 00:45:29,066
Oh, my God! You shot him! Carl!

823
00:45:30,944 --> 00:45:32,942
- Lee!
- He shouldn't have made a move.

824
00:45:38,856 --> 00:45:39,865
Lee?

825
00:45:42,113 --> 00:45:43,611
Hot dog, please!

826
00:45:46,738 --> 00:45:48,107
- You're nuts!
- What?

827
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:50,654
- Oh, man!
- You're nuts!

828
00:45:51,403 --> 00:45:52,572
You're nuts!

829
00:45:53,611 --> 00:45:55,899
It was just a starter pistol.
It just starts races.

830
00:45:55,939 --> 00:45:56,948
It don't kill nobody,

831
00:45:56,988 --> 00:45:58,236
- it don't hurt nobody.
- Crazy!

832
00:45:58,946 --> 00:46:01,573
I'm just demonstrating
white power.

833
00:46:01,613 --> 00:46:03,191
So am I, honey.

834
00:46:03,231 --> 00:46:05,819
Sweetheart, baby,
it was just a joke.

835
00:46:06,488 --> 00:46:08,067
Y'all can go and
get the hell out,

836
00:46:08,107 --> 00:46:09,945
you and your partner.

837
00:46:11,943 --> 00:46:13,731
Thought they could take a joke.

838
00:46:16,238 --> 00:46:17,607
I'm performing.

839
00:46:19,405 --> 00:46:21,443
Sorry, Larry, they're
usually nice guys.

840
00:46:21,483 --> 00:46:23,781
No, come on. Don't let
those fools bother you.

841
00:46:23,821 --> 00:46:26,448
Why don't we all go to my room
and relax for a little bit?

842
00:46:26,488 --> 00:46:28,276
We told a friend we'd drop by.

843
00:46:28,606 --> 00:46:29,615
Maybe later.

844
00:46:30,274 --> 00:46:31,403
Come on.

845
00:46:31,773 --> 00:46:33,281
Find me later.

846
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:35,949
See you!

847
00:46:37,068 --> 00:46:38,656
I thought everybody should know.

848
00:46:38,696 --> 00:46:39,815
But you scared them off, man.

849
00:46:39,865 --> 00:46:41,403
But Karen though...

850
00:46:41,443 --> 00:46:42,902
She was looking at me.

851
00:46:42,942 --> 00:46:45,399
- Karen wasn't looking at you.
- Karen was feeling me, man.

852
00:46:45,439 --> 00:46:48,406
She was like, "Hey, Aubrey!"
I was like, "Hey, Karen!"

853
00:46:48,446 --> 00:46:51,114
<i>Disperse or you
will be arrested.</i>

854
00:46:51,773 --> 00:46:52,942
Julie!

855
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,648
We should teach these
pigs a lesson.

856
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:58,946
What you talking about, Carl?

857
00:46:59,615 --> 00:47:01,273
Them right down there.

858
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:08,736
You know if you shoot them, they're
gonna shoot us back, right?

859
00:47:09,615 --> 00:47:11,403
How they gonna know where
it came from, Lee?

860
00:47:11,443 --> 00:47:12,902
- It's not even possible.
- Just calm down, man.

861
00:47:12,942 --> 00:47:13,941
Man, you chicken.

862
00:47:13,981 --> 00:47:15,109
It's already crazy
in here enough.

863
00:47:15,149 --> 00:47:16,898
Look. They need to understand

864
00:47:16,948 --> 00:47:18,406
that they can't be picking
on us all the time.

865
00:47:18,446 --> 00:47:19,565
Y'all gotta be with the program!

866
00:47:19,615 --> 00:47:20,694
We're gonna get our asses beat!

867
00:47:20,734 --> 00:47:22,232
- One, two.
- Would you...

868
00:47:22,902 --> 00:47:24,780
Get down! Hit the deck!

869
00:47:25,949 --> 00:47:27,197
You guys okay?

870
00:47:27,237 --> 00:47:28,656
- Who's shooting?
- From down there, maybe?

871
00:47:30,444 --> 00:47:32,023
It could be any one
of those buildings.

872
00:47:32,073 --> 00:47:33,901
Did you just hear
that gunshot, baby?

873
00:47:33,941 --> 00:47:35,819
No, I didn't hear anything.

874
00:47:37,237 --> 00:47:39,615
Anyway, you know if I
get a record deal,

875
00:47:39,655 --> 00:47:41,233
we gonna drive a
Cadillac, right?

876
00:47:42,272 --> 00:47:43,821
Look, check him out!

877
00:47:46,108 --> 00:47:47,447
Run, Mr. Cracker, run!

878
00:47:49,235 --> 00:47:50,404
Get down!

879
00:47:50,444 --> 00:47:51,573
Muzzle flash!

880
00:47:51,613 --> 00:47:54,320
By the Algiers,
could be a sniper.

881
00:47:57,067 --> 00:47:58,856
- Mike?
- I'm okay!

882
00:47:58,906 --> 00:48:00,444
I didn't get hit!

883
00:48:09,155 --> 00:48:11,024
Keifer Command, this is
Warrant Officer Roberts.

884
00:48:11,073 --> 00:48:12,112
Take cover!

885
00:48:12,152 --> 00:48:13,281
Army taking sniper fire.

886
00:48:13,321 --> 00:48:15,739
Algiers Motel vicinity,
on Virginia Park.

887
00:48:17,107 --> 00:48:18,606
Yeah, keep running.

888
00:48:20,274 --> 00:48:22,532
- That was bad, brother.
- That's crazy, man.

889
00:48:22,572 --> 00:48:24,610
Now everybody know what
it's like to be black.

890
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:28,566
Police 2-4, potential sniper

891
00:48:28,606 --> 00:48:29,735
- in the area.
- Army taking fire.

892
00:48:29,775 --> 00:48:31,573
<i>Near the Algiers Motel</i>

893
00:48:31,613 --> 00:48:33,571
<i>on Virginia Park.
Sniper on the roof.</i>

894
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:36,448
<i>Sniper fire, sniper
fire, Virginia Park.</i>

895
00:48:36,488 --> 00:48:38,566
<i>Sniper fire near
the Algiers Motel.</i>

896
00:48:38,606 --> 00:48:39,945
10-4, on the way.

897
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:47,777
<i>Shots fired, Virginia
Park, sniper on the roof.</i>

898
00:48:51,983 --> 00:48:53,611
Sniper out there!

899
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,609
Lock the whole place up!

900
00:48:57,277 --> 00:48:58,946
Let's find that motherfucker.

901
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:07,737
Anyway, my boy Fred was just telling
me that the rioting is getting so bad,

902
00:49:07,777 --> 00:49:10,564
even Ford's thinking about
shutting down assembly for a day.

903
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:11,903
Larry, that's terrible.

904
00:49:11,943 --> 00:49:13,071
<i>Yeah, I know it is.</i>

905
00:49:13,111 --> 00:49:14,900
Maybe we should make
the most of it.

906
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:17,857
In a time of hate, love
does become more important.

907
00:49:17,907 --> 00:49:19,615
Maybe the most important.

908
00:49:19,655 --> 00:49:21,073
Why don't you come over
here and visit me?

909
00:49:21,113 --> 00:49:24,280
<i>We got a swimming pool and I think
we need to spend some time together.</i>

910
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:27,027
My mom says I can't
leave the house.

911
00:49:27,067 --> 00:49:28,446
<i>But I want to.</i>

912
00:49:29,945 --> 00:49:32,072
Your mama, right.

913
00:49:39,905 --> 00:49:41,023
- Give me some shells.
- Here.

914
00:49:41,073 --> 00:49:42,152
Thanks.

915
00:50:00,064 --> 00:50:01,573
Move, move, move! Move forward!

916
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:05,689
Left hand, top window!

917
00:50:05,739 --> 00:50:06,778
Spread out to the side!

918
00:50:08,606 --> 00:50:11,153
Hey, y'all, there's a bunch
of police outside right now.

919
00:50:13,781 --> 00:50:15,109
Quit playing, man!

920
00:50:15,149 --> 00:50:17,197
Why would I be playing?

921
00:50:17,237 --> 00:50:18,736
Yo, is they lost?

922
00:50:18,776 --> 00:50:19,905
Come on, move!

923
00:50:19,944 --> 00:50:21,733
I hope so! What you
mean? I don't know.

924
00:50:21,773 --> 00:50:24,240
I don't know, man, but it look like
they coming right toward the house.

925
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,778
Go! Don't just stand
there! Move up!

926
00:50:28,736 --> 00:50:29,775
Get in position!

927
00:50:33,231 --> 00:50:35,109
- Close the windows!
- Window!

928
00:50:35,149 --> 00:50:37,607
Hide everything!
Turn the lights off!

929
00:50:38,776 --> 00:50:39,775
Sniper!

930
00:50:41,902 --> 00:50:42,981
Oh, shit!

931
00:50:43,611 --> 00:50:44,610
Baby, did you hear that?

932
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:45,779
They're shooting at us!

933
00:50:52,232 --> 00:50:53,611
I gotta go! They're shooting us.

934
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:55,319
Larry!

935
00:50:56,398 --> 00:50:57,447
Fred, you good?

936
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:03,191
You good?

937
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,649
I don't wanna die, man!

938
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,026
We gotta get out of here!

939
00:51:08,066 --> 00:51:09,735
- Man, don't get up!
- Carl, stay down!

940
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,942
- They can't do this to us.
- Stay down!

941
00:51:11,982 --> 00:51:13,441
They can't do this to us.

942
00:51:13,481 --> 00:51:15,489
- Carl, stay down!
- What're you doing, man?

943
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:18,106
Here we go!

944
00:51:20,404 --> 00:51:21,653
Go. Go. Go. Go.

945
00:51:37,607 --> 00:51:38,736
Going up.

946
00:51:47,277 --> 00:51:48,316
Clear!

947
00:51:53,281 --> 00:51:54,490
Clear!

948
00:52:01,113 --> 00:52:02,322
Police!

949
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:15,069
Hey, do you hear that?

950
00:52:15,489 --> 00:52:16,817
Fred, stay low!

951
00:52:32,112 --> 00:52:33,441
Police! Get on the floor!

952
00:52:33,481 --> 00:52:34,939
Get the fuck against
the wall right now!

953
00:52:36,448 --> 00:52:37,607
All right, all right!

954
00:52:37,657 --> 00:52:38,905
I didn't do nothing!

955
00:52:43,151 --> 00:52:44,240
Have you got a weapon?

956
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,439
I don't have a fucking gun!

957
00:52:45,489 --> 00:52:46,648
Put your hands behind your back!

958
00:52:48,156 --> 00:52:49,615
- Have you got a firearm?
- No!

959
00:52:49,655 --> 00:52:51,073
Have you got a fucking weapon?

960
00:52:57,737 --> 00:52:59,365
Go, go, go!

961
00:52:59,405 --> 00:53:00,734
- Come here! Come on!
- Why you doing this?

962
00:53:01,653 --> 00:53:03,780
Get him the fuck downstairs now.

963
00:53:05,279 --> 00:53:07,277
- Get the fuck out of here now!
- Get out of here!

964
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:08,446
- Come on!
- Take him!

965
00:53:28,985 --> 00:53:32,072
Put your hands on your head
and relax. Just calm down.

966
00:53:32,322 --> 00:53:34,739
Sit down. Put your
hands on your head.

967
00:53:34,779 --> 00:53:36,737
Move the fuck downstairs! Go!

968
00:53:36,777 --> 00:53:39,445
I don't have a gun!
Don't pull, man!

969
00:53:40,733 --> 00:53:42,612
Police! Put your
hands on your head!

970
00:53:43,571 --> 00:53:44,610
They already are.

971
00:53:56,568 --> 00:53:58,196
Against the walls and doors!

972
00:53:58,236 --> 00:53:59,405
All of them! Against the wall!

973
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:00,574
Fred!

974
00:54:00,943 --> 00:54:02,072
Walls and doors!

975
00:54:02,112 --> 00:54:03,730
I didn't do nothing!

976
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:05,319
I don't have nothing!

977
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:10,064
I don't got no gun!

978
00:54:16,068 --> 00:54:17,407
Anybody in there?

979
00:54:17,447 --> 00:54:18,566
No, sir.

980
00:54:20,733 --> 00:54:22,402
Get the fuck up! Get up!

981
00:54:22,442 --> 00:54:23,441
Get downstairs! Go!

982
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:25,818
- Get him downstairs!
- What's going...

983
00:54:27,567 --> 00:54:28,985
What're you doing here?

984
00:54:32,232 --> 00:54:33,820
Down on the ground! Get down!

985
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:36,278
- I'm not resisting!
- Get up!

986
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,779
Yeah, keep goin'!
Don't look at me!

987
00:54:45,239 --> 00:54:47,776
Against the wall,
bring them all down!

988
00:54:48,446 --> 00:54:50,064
Hey! You got him?

989
00:54:50,733 --> 00:54:51,772
Against the walls and doors!

990
00:54:51,822 --> 00:54:53,191
Turn around and stay
against the wall.

991
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:55,319
Let's get them down here!

992
00:54:57,237 --> 00:54:58,236
Let's go!

993
00:54:59,275 --> 00:55:00,274
Don't you fucking move!

994
00:55:02,981 --> 00:55:04,899
- Get them, go!
- What did we do?

995
00:55:05,319 --> 00:55:06,697
You better shut your mouth!

996
00:55:06,737 --> 00:55:08,276
Get them! Get the fuck...
Get out of here!

997
00:55:08,735 --> 00:55:10,114
Get the fuck downstairs!

998
00:55:23,071 --> 00:55:25,109
Go! Let's get them down here!

999
00:55:27,317 --> 00:55:28,735
Go! Down the stairs! Let's go!

1000
00:55:28,775 --> 00:55:29,984
- Let's go!
- Okay, okay!

1001
00:55:31,652 --> 00:55:34,280
Come on, man! My arm, man! Stop!

1002
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,608
We didn't even do anything!

1003
00:55:36,647 --> 00:55:37,696
Shit!

1004
00:55:43,401 --> 00:55:44,649
Where's Carl, man?

1005
00:55:48,316 --> 00:55:49,734
Where's Carl?

1006
00:55:50,234 --> 00:55:51,273
What happened?

1007
00:55:52,781 --> 00:55:54,859
Fella here had a knife,
tried to go for my gun.

1008
00:55:54,899 --> 00:55:56,897
Yeah, I heard him shout,
"Get off my gun!"

1009
00:55:57,407 --> 00:55:59,275
Yeah, it all happened
pretty fast.

1010
00:56:01,443 --> 00:56:03,151
I guess you had to
defend yourself.

1011
00:56:04,989 --> 00:56:06,068
Aubrey, get back!

1012
00:56:07,487 --> 00:56:09,944
Get back against the wall! Move!

1013
00:56:10,943 --> 00:56:13,860
- Chill!
- They killed Carl!

1014
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,898
Don't be stupid, boy!
Stay against the wall!

1015
00:56:15,948 --> 00:56:16,987
Okay, okay.

1016
00:56:18,985 --> 00:56:21,772
He has his face filled with
blood. They killed him, man.

1017
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,448
Shame. A young kid like that.

1018
00:56:29,315 --> 00:56:32,611
Still, he might be the
shooter. We need to find out.

1019
00:56:37,067 --> 00:56:38,735
They killed him, man.

1020
00:56:48,156 --> 00:56:49,944
They killed our friend.

1021
00:56:50,274 --> 00:56:52,072
What's the deal with the girls?

1022
00:56:52,112 --> 00:56:53,900
I found them with the big
nigger down the end.

1023
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:55,069
Same room?

1024
00:57:01,732 --> 00:57:03,321
- You find anything?
- Nothing.

1025
00:57:03,361 --> 00:57:04,400
No gun?

1026
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,449
No.

1027
00:57:15,568 --> 00:57:16,947
Some bad news.

1028
00:57:18,945 --> 00:57:20,444
One of the guests is dead.

1029
00:57:22,781 --> 00:57:25,109
He tried to take a
police officer's weapon,

1030
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,237
ended up getting shot.

1031
00:57:28,316 --> 00:57:29,564
Carl Cooper.

1032
00:57:30,444 --> 00:57:31,732
He killed Carl.

1033
00:57:40,114 --> 00:57:41,732
May he rest in peace. Amen.

1034
00:57:41,772 --> 00:57:42,821
Amen.

1035
00:57:46,278 --> 00:57:48,276
Now let's not be stupid
in this situation.

1036
00:57:50,573 --> 00:57:53,780
We still have a crime scene
here and you're all suspects.

1037
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,818
Each and every one of you.

1038
00:57:56,318 --> 00:57:58,066
Don't look at me!

1039
00:57:58,106 --> 00:58:00,114
Turn around, face the wall!

1040
00:58:07,946 --> 00:58:09,814
Was Carl the one
doing the shooting?

1041
00:58:18,236 --> 00:58:20,114
Somebody better start
getting honest with me.

1042
00:58:24,859 --> 00:58:26,238
Hey! I want that gun!

1043
00:58:26,278 --> 00:58:27,566
We looked around, we
didn't find a gun.

1044
00:58:27,606 --> 00:58:29,774
Doesn't mean it's not
here! Go find it!

1045
00:58:30,274 --> 00:58:31,442
You, too!

1046
00:58:36,947 --> 00:58:38,775
I got nothing
against you people.

1047
00:58:42,072 --> 00:58:44,649
But you need to tell
me where the gun is.

1048
00:58:46,647 --> 00:58:48,316
You need to tell me

1049
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,773
who was doing the shooting.

1050
00:58:51,902 --> 00:58:53,940
I'm only gonna ask
so many times.

1051
00:58:55,399 --> 00:58:57,067
Who did the shooting?

1052
00:58:57,107 --> 00:58:58,196
We don't know.

1053
00:58:58,236 --> 00:58:59,614
You do fucking know!

1054
00:59:03,111 --> 00:59:05,948
You were upstairs, who
was doing the shooting?

1055
00:59:07,946 --> 00:59:10,064
- Who was doing the shooting?
- You doing the shooting, man!

1056
00:59:10,114 --> 00:59:11,273
Lee!

1057
00:59:11,942 --> 00:59:12,941
No, man.

1058
00:59:14,939 --> 00:59:16,777
Carl ain't got no gun.

1059
00:59:17,237 --> 00:59:18,276
What's that?

1060
00:59:18,316 --> 00:59:19,944
You're the ones out
here killing people!

1061
00:59:20,613 --> 00:59:22,781
Say that to my face!

1062
00:59:22,821 --> 00:59:24,439
I said, Carl ain't
shoot nobody, man!

1063
00:59:24,489 --> 00:59:26,148
Yeah, all right.

1064
00:59:31,153 --> 00:59:32,322
Fuck.

1065
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:36,357
Stop your goddamn
crying! Face the door!

1066
00:59:36,397 --> 00:59:38,106
You, too. Face the front!

1067
00:59:42,441 --> 00:59:44,569
Why don't you pick that
up and defend yourself?

1068
00:59:49,614 --> 00:59:51,402
It's easy, look.

1069
01:00:04,779 --> 01:00:06,447
You sure you don't
wanna try and stab me?

1070
01:00:11,402 --> 01:00:12,781
I'm not gonna play your game.

1071
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:15,069
Well.

1072
01:00:16,278 --> 01:00:18,106
That would just give
me an excuse to do

1073
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:19,984
what we both know is
gonna happen anyway.

1074
01:00:20,403 --> 01:00:21,402
Right?

1075
01:00:22,321 --> 01:00:24,070
Man, y'all some crazy crackers!

1076
01:00:25,279 --> 01:00:26,278
Shit!

1077
01:00:32,361 --> 01:00:33,690
Get off of me.

1078
01:00:44,649 --> 01:00:46,567
You still a cracker.

1079
01:00:47,776 --> 01:00:49,864
Shut the fuck up,
all right? Shut up.

1080
01:00:51,902 --> 01:00:54,280
There's a goddamn
shooter in this house.

1081
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:55,778
Was it Carl?

1082
01:00:56,357 --> 01:00:57,946
Let me tell you something.

1083
01:00:58,315 --> 01:01:01,782
If you think that you can
shoot at innocent people

1084
01:01:01,822 --> 01:01:02,901
and get away with it,

1085
01:01:04,689 --> 01:01:06,397
you are dead wrong.

1086
01:01:09,444 --> 01:01:12,032
My partner said, "Stand up."

1087
01:01:12,072 --> 01:01:13,860
- Look, I'll take him.
- So stand.

1088
01:01:14,899 --> 01:01:16,647
Go search the place,
I'll take him with me.

1089
01:01:16,697 --> 01:01:18,615
Come on, come on.

1090
01:01:18,655 --> 01:01:20,573
- Come on.
- Get the fuck outta here.

1091
01:01:28,735 --> 01:01:30,523
I got all night, people.

1092
01:01:31,482 --> 01:01:33,280
Nobody's gonna talk?

1093
01:01:34,239 --> 01:01:35,898
Nobody knows who the shooter is?

1094
01:01:35,948 --> 01:01:37,406
Please, God. Please, God.

1095
01:01:37,446 --> 01:01:38,775
Nobody's going to admit shit?

1096
01:01:39,235 --> 01:01:40,273
All right.

1097
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:42,441
Then start prayin'.

1098
01:01:43,111 --> 01:01:45,278
Start praying. What's the
matter, boy? You don't pray?

1099
01:01:45,988 --> 01:01:47,566
You don't go to fuckin' church?

1100
01:01:47,986 --> 01:01:49,814
- Start praying!
- Oh, Lord.

1101
01:01:49,864 --> 01:01:52,112
Forgive our trespasses as we forgive
those that trespass against us.

1102
01:01:52,152 --> 01:01:54,070
'Cause I will kill
you, one by one,

1103
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:57,736
until you tell me exactly
what is going on here.

1104
01:01:57,776 --> 01:01:59,614
Cover us with the
blood of Jesus, God.

1105
01:02:00,273 --> 01:02:03,071
I'm just gonna assume
you're all criminals.

1106
01:02:03,111 --> 01:02:05,898
Because if we're honest,
you probably are.

1107
01:02:06,607 --> 01:02:08,066
So let's hear it.

1108
01:02:08,106 --> 01:02:09,814
Let's fucking hear it!

1109
01:02:10,323 --> 01:02:12,152
Pray! Do it loud!

1110
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:15,318
You don't sing that gospel shit?

1111
01:02:16,068 --> 01:02:17,736
<i>My way</i>

1112
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:18,945
There you go, now
we got two of 'em.

1113
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:20,194
Take the hate out
of our hearts, God.

1114
01:02:20,233 --> 01:02:21,402
What about you?

1115
01:02:21,442 --> 01:02:22,861
<i>Your grace is with me</i>

1116
01:02:22,901 --> 01:02:25,738
You are not praying. I'm not
hearing shit out of you.

1117
01:02:25,778 --> 01:02:27,566
- Mary, full of grace...
- I don't give a fuck.

1118
01:02:27,606 --> 01:02:30,233
You may need a little fuckin'
help to know how to pray.

1119
01:02:32,901 --> 01:02:35,069
<i>You are near me</i>

1120
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:37,107
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1121
01:02:37,157 --> 01:02:38,615
<i>When my life</i>

1122
01:02:38,985 --> 01:02:40,443
He's really fuckin' praying.

1123
01:02:40,483 --> 01:02:41,782
It's not bad.

1124
01:02:50,943 --> 01:02:52,571
All right, check the room.

1125
01:02:52,611 --> 01:02:55,488
Under the beds and in
the drawers. Okay?

1126
01:03:08,155 --> 01:03:09,484
They're gonna kill us, man.

1127
01:03:10,233 --> 01:03:12,321
Why? You gonna be crazy?

1128
01:03:14,279 --> 01:03:16,277
They the ones that's
acting crazy.

1129
01:03:16,317 --> 01:03:17,856
They lost they mind
when they seen

1130
01:03:17,906 --> 01:03:19,904
a couple white girls in a
room with a black man.

1131
01:03:19,944 --> 01:03:21,782
They're lookin' for
a sniper, okay?

1132
01:03:22,441 --> 01:03:24,739
But Carl wasn't no sniper, man.

1133
01:03:25,318 --> 01:03:26,567
So if a guy goes for your gun,

1134
01:03:26,607 --> 01:03:28,615
you gonna let him have
it because he's black?

1135
01:03:28,655 --> 01:03:29,694
Come on!

1136
01:03:31,152 --> 01:03:33,440
A cop has a shotgun
like yours, right?

1137
01:03:35,778 --> 01:03:37,606
You hold that tight
with two hands.

1138
01:03:39,814 --> 01:03:41,652
How you even gonna
try to take that?

1139
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:45,488
Lotta ways.

1140
01:04:01,612 --> 01:04:04,899
There's no guns in this whole motel
except the ones these cops brought.

1141
01:04:05,738 --> 01:04:06,817
There's no guns.

1142
01:04:09,944 --> 01:04:12,281
We takin' something
for those crazy boys.

1143
01:04:18,105 --> 01:04:19,444
Pick 'em up.

1144
01:04:20,653 --> 01:04:22,401
What's the point?

1145
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:25,898
Look, I understand. Okay?

1146
01:04:26,607 --> 01:04:28,615
But don't antagonize those guys.

1147
01:04:29,484 --> 01:04:31,272
I need you to survive the night.

1148
01:04:32,941 --> 01:04:34,439
Survive the night.

1149
01:04:35,898 --> 01:04:37,406
All right?

1150
01:04:37,446 --> 01:04:38,905
You don't think
you're gonna talk?

1151
01:04:38,945 --> 01:04:40,403
I'll fucking make you talk.

1152
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:41,482
Where's the fuckin' gun?

1153
01:04:42,111 --> 01:04:44,239
Get up! Get the fuck up!

1154
01:04:44,279 --> 01:04:45,358
You gonna tell me
where the gun is?

1155
01:04:45,398 --> 01:04:47,316
- I don't know.
- Bullshit!

1156
01:04:49,484 --> 01:04:51,532
Stop fucking lying to me!

1157
01:04:51,572 --> 01:04:53,190
Where's the fucking gun?

1158
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,108
I swear to God, I'll pull
the fucking trigger!

1159
01:04:55,148 --> 01:04:56,147
Where is it?

1160
01:04:56,607 --> 01:04:57,736
I don't know, I swear...

1161
01:04:57,776 --> 01:04:58,775
Bullshit!

1162
01:05:04,949 --> 01:05:06,107
Come here.

1163
01:05:06,147 --> 01:05:07,236
What's going on?

1164
01:05:07,276 --> 01:05:09,864
I gotta tell you, Detroit
PD is going nuts in there.

1165
01:05:09,904 --> 01:05:11,112
What do you mean?

1166
01:05:11,152 --> 01:05:12,781
Looks like they're
terrorizing suspects,

1167
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:14,949
beating and so forth,
trying to get a confession.

1168
01:05:14,989 --> 01:05:17,406
Well, that's not correct,
they got their civil rights.

1169
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:18,565
That's what I'm saying.

1170
01:05:18,945 --> 01:05:20,363
Don't look right to me.

1171
01:05:20,403 --> 01:05:21,732
Where's that fucking gun?

1172
01:05:21,782 --> 01:05:23,280
Don't lie to me!
Where's the gun?

1173
01:05:24,399 --> 01:05:25,608
All right.

1174
01:05:26,947 --> 01:05:29,064
Let's let them have the case.

1175
01:05:29,114 --> 01:05:32,821
I don't wanna get involved in any
civil rights mix-up, you know?

1176
01:05:34,279 --> 01:05:35,608
Let's go.

1177
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:50,363
- Where's the fucking gun?
- I don't know!

1178
01:05:50,403 --> 01:05:52,691
Bullshit! You people
are always lying!

1179
01:05:52,731 --> 01:05:53,780
Who's the shooter?

1180
01:06:00,403 --> 01:06:01,572
Find it?

1181
01:06:01,612 --> 01:06:02,611
No.

1182
01:06:04,109 --> 01:06:05,738
All this looks stolen.

1183
01:06:05,778 --> 01:06:07,446
I searched the whole
room, myself.

1184
01:06:07,946 --> 01:06:09,614
He wouldn't even tell you, huh?

1185
01:06:10,982 --> 01:06:13,110
All right. Get Demens
to watch the line.

1186
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:14,569
Come with me.

1187
01:06:14,609 --> 01:06:16,447
Get in there. Quickly.

1188
01:06:17,156 --> 01:06:18,655
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Lie down.

1189
01:06:19,484 --> 01:06:21,272
Come on! We need you in here.

1190
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:25,028
Get the...

1191
01:06:25,068 --> 01:06:26,447
Get on the goddamn floor.

1192
01:06:30,073 --> 01:06:32,071
You don't have to do this, man.

1193
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:45,108
We're gonna hold the line.

1194
01:06:49,444 --> 01:06:51,782
Why you gotta fuck them, huh?

1195
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:55,568
What's wrong with us?

1196
01:06:55,608 --> 01:06:56,777
Listen to me.

1197
01:06:57,156 --> 01:06:58,445
You need to tell me

1198
01:06:58,815 --> 01:07:01,192
where the gun is and
who the shooter is...

1199
01:07:01,232 --> 01:07:02,731
I swear to you there's no gun.

1200
01:07:02,781 --> 01:07:03,860
There's no gun, man!

1201
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,448
Or I swear to God,
I will kill you.

1202
01:07:08,735 --> 01:07:11,072
There's no gun, man.

1203
01:07:14,399 --> 01:07:15,448
Okay.

1204
01:07:15,488 --> 01:07:16,946
I don't know nothing, man.

1205
01:07:17,945 --> 01:07:18,944
No!

1206
01:07:24,279 --> 01:07:26,906
He shot him. He shot him.

1207
01:07:31,322 --> 01:07:32,781
Face the fucking wall.

1208
01:07:38,775 --> 01:07:41,192
Be still and stay quiet,

1209
01:07:41,232 --> 01:07:43,690
or the next one is for real.

1210
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:44,779
Understand?

1211
01:07:49,114 --> 01:07:50,483
This'll make 'em
talk. Watch this.

1212
01:07:56,777 --> 01:07:58,315
That one didn't even kick.

1213
01:08:00,273 --> 01:08:02,281
That's what happens
when you lie to us.

1214
01:08:04,739 --> 01:08:06,777
Who else wants to kill one?

1215
01:08:07,945 --> 01:08:09,404
You wanna kill one?

1216
01:08:11,112 --> 01:08:12,231
Okay.

1217
01:08:12,781 --> 01:08:13,939
All right.

1218
01:08:29,774 --> 01:08:31,732
Officer, wait! I
didn't shoot nobody!

1219
01:08:31,782 --> 01:08:33,190
- Officer, wait!
- Shut up!

1220
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,279
Fuck!

1221
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:35,448
Shut up. Get the fuck in there.

1222
01:08:36,067 --> 01:08:38,065
I told you I don't know where
the fucking gun is, man.

1223
01:08:38,115 --> 01:08:39,444
- You looked for it, right?
- Shut your mouth!

1224
01:08:40,613 --> 01:08:43,899
Hey, man. You gotta tell me where
the gun is so all this can stop.

1225
01:08:43,939 --> 01:08:45,238
- Where's the gun?
- I don't know.

1226
01:08:45,278 --> 01:08:47,276
- You can't do this shit!
- Shut the fuck up!

1227
01:08:50,822 --> 01:08:52,531
Michael. Michael.

1228
01:08:52,571 --> 01:08:54,239
You think we're bluffin'?

1229
01:08:54,279 --> 01:08:55,817
This is Detroit.

1230
01:08:56,357 --> 01:08:57,736
We don't bluff.

1231
01:08:57,776 --> 01:08:59,654
Now, be quiet,

1232
01:08:59,983 --> 01:09:02,071
or the next one
will be for real.

1233
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:14,948
I killed that nigger.

1234
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:16,607
There you have it.

1235
01:09:18,615 --> 01:09:21,192
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1236
01:09:22,651 --> 01:09:25,398
Get your goddamn hands
off her. Turn around.

1237
01:09:25,448 --> 01:09:26,946
What's your part
in all this, huh?

1238
01:09:27,196 --> 01:09:29,234
Probably know where the gun is.

1239
01:09:29,274 --> 01:09:31,402
Probably know who
the shooter is.

1240
01:09:31,442 --> 01:09:33,530
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1241
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:35,148
Yes, you do.

1242
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:36,567
And you're lyin' to me.

1243
01:09:36,607 --> 01:09:37,855
Get away from me!

1244
01:09:37,905 --> 01:09:39,444
You think you'd get a
pass 'cause you're white?

1245
01:09:39,484 --> 01:09:41,901
No, whore. You don't.
Find out what she knows.

1246
01:09:41,941 --> 01:09:43,610
It's okay. Easy, easy.

1247
01:09:45,108 --> 01:09:48,655
Face the goddamn wall. I'm
not gonna tell you again.

1248
01:09:51,152 --> 01:09:52,940
It's just you and me.

1249
01:09:53,779 --> 01:09:54,778
Take a seat.

1250
01:09:59,614 --> 01:10:00,772
Sit down.

1251
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:04,029
Sit down.

1252
01:10:05,528 --> 01:10:06,657
Ouch.

1253
01:10:07,196 --> 01:10:08,655
You all right there, miss?

1254
01:10:08,944 --> 01:10:10,323
Is everything okay?

1255
01:10:12,651 --> 01:10:13,899
You're okay though, right?

1256
01:10:13,939 --> 01:10:15,528
Don't touch me.

1257
01:10:17,106 --> 01:10:18,445
Try to keep calm.

1258
01:10:20,443 --> 01:10:22,111
What are you doin' living here?

1259
01:10:22,441 --> 01:10:23,739
It's a hotel, isn't it?

1260
01:10:23,779 --> 01:10:25,068
Yeah.

1261
01:10:25,108 --> 01:10:26,816
So you're up here for a while?

1262
01:10:28,025 --> 01:10:29,274
Some

1263
01:10:30,443 --> 01:10:32,031
prostitution, maybe?

1264
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:35,488
I'm visiting from Ohio.

1265
01:10:35,528 --> 01:10:37,236
My father is a judge.

1266
01:10:37,276 --> 01:10:39,574
And your father, he knows
you're here, right?

1267
01:10:39,614 --> 01:10:41,402
Living amongst the blacks?

1268
01:10:41,442 --> 01:10:42,730
Are there black people here?

1269
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:44,359
I didn't notice, I'm colorblind.

1270
01:10:44,988 --> 01:10:46,107
Really?

1271
01:10:46,607 --> 01:10:48,565
What color am I? Blue?

1272
01:10:50,113 --> 01:10:51,901
You look yellow to me, sir.

1273
01:10:58,315 --> 01:11:00,023
- You're working prostitution.
- No!

1274
01:11:04,279 --> 01:11:05,608
Look at me.

1275
01:11:06,107 --> 01:11:07,526
You're fuckin' these
black guys, right?

1276
01:11:08,365 --> 01:11:09,823
They're kids.

1277
01:11:09,863 --> 01:11:12,151
What's the matter with you?

1278
01:11:12,611 --> 01:11:15,068
I'm trying to protect you, miss.

1279
01:11:19,524 --> 01:11:21,112
Stay there.

1280
01:11:26,986 --> 01:11:28,115
She's a hooker.

1281
01:11:29,693 --> 01:11:31,402
All right, fuck it. Come here.

1282
01:11:35,947 --> 01:11:37,905
So, you are the pimp.

1283
01:11:37,945 --> 01:11:40,273
No, sir. I think
you're mistaken.

1284
01:11:41,821 --> 01:11:43,490
- Fuck!
- Listen.

1285
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:45,068
We've got all the
time in the world.

1286
01:11:45,108 --> 01:11:46,986
We are gonna get to
the bottom of this.

1287
01:11:47,026 --> 01:11:50,573
So think very carefully about
how you answer our questions,

1288
01:11:50,613 --> 01:11:52,780
or you're gonna end up like
your friends in the next room.

1289
01:11:54,149 --> 01:11:56,237
How long you been pimpin'
out these young girls, huh?

1290
01:11:56,277 --> 01:11:57,695
Destroying their
bodies and minds.

1291
01:11:57,735 --> 01:11:59,693
I just met 'em. I ain't pimpin'.

1292
01:11:59,733 --> 01:12:01,152
I just got back from the war.

1293
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:03,779
You're a veteran?

1294
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:05,358
Yes, sir.

1295
01:12:07,945 --> 01:12:10,403
Fuckin' stupid do
you think I am?

1296
01:12:10,443 --> 01:12:11,611
You wear army green,

1297
01:12:11,651 --> 01:12:13,110
you try to be a
fucking serviceman.

1298
01:12:13,150 --> 01:12:15,528
We don't need pimps in the army.

1299
01:12:16,946 --> 01:12:18,944
Probably drove a
fucking supply truck.

1300
01:12:22,281 --> 01:12:24,319
I was airborne.

1301
01:12:36,696 --> 01:12:38,025
Look out!

1302
01:12:38,365 --> 01:12:39,903
Take cover!

1303
01:12:39,943 --> 01:12:41,482
Move to cover!

1304
01:12:41,532 --> 01:12:43,030
Get down! Get down!

1305
01:12:43,939 --> 01:12:45,278
Go, go, go!

1306
01:12:47,356 --> 01:12:49,274
- Take cover!
- Sniper!

1307
01:12:50,942 --> 01:12:51,941
Down, down!

1308
01:12:52,281 --> 01:12:54,568
Across the street! They're
running up Euclid!

1309
01:12:54,608 --> 01:12:56,067
- Three houses up.
- I see him!

1310
01:12:56,107 --> 01:12:57,356
Who's got eyes on him?

1311
01:12:57,406 --> 01:12:59,274
Don't worry about it. If it
was anything, they'd grab us.

1312
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:07,196
Larry, what are you doin'?

1313
01:13:09,404 --> 01:13:10,443
Larry.

1314
01:13:11,192 --> 01:13:12,860
Get back on the wall.

1315
01:13:13,939 --> 01:13:15,398
Let's get the fuck
up outta here.

1316
01:13:15,448 --> 01:13:16,816
They're gonna come back.

1317
01:13:16,856 --> 01:13:18,235
We can. Let's go.

1318
01:13:18,275 --> 01:13:19,613
No.

1319
01:13:19,653 --> 01:13:20,862
What are you doing, man?

1320
01:13:21,282 --> 01:13:22,570
Come on. Come on.

1321
01:13:23,110 --> 01:13:24,449
Fred, let's go.

1322
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,945
No, Larry. Stop.

1323
01:13:30,113 --> 01:13:32,151
Who's got eyes on him?

1324
01:13:32,191 --> 01:13:33,779
Watch the roof!

1325
01:13:43,609 --> 01:13:45,278
Just breathe, just breathe.

1326
01:13:46,776 --> 01:13:48,654
It's okay. I'm here, I'm here.

1327
01:13:56,357 --> 01:13:57,865
Come on, come on.

1328
01:14:07,356 --> 01:14:09,024
Stay the fuck away.

1329
01:14:11,781 --> 01:14:13,779
Check all those windows!

1330
01:14:19,274 --> 01:14:20,942
Hold your perimeter!

1331
01:14:26,526 --> 01:14:27,655
They're shooting. You hear that?

1332
01:14:27,695 --> 01:14:28,774
Shut up!

1333
01:14:28,814 --> 01:14:31,781
Fall back! Covering
fire! Put it down!

1334
01:14:31,821 --> 01:14:34,109
Fire! Fire!

1335
01:14:36,566 --> 01:14:37,735
Oh, shit!

1336
01:14:37,775 --> 01:14:38,864
Oh, shit!

1337
01:14:41,531 --> 01:14:43,489
- We got 'em!
- Hold your fire!

1338
01:14:43,529 --> 01:14:44,948
All right, it's clear.

1339
01:14:47,276 --> 01:14:49,114
Snipers everywhere, tonight.

1340
01:14:51,032 --> 01:14:52,281
Clear!

1341
01:15:01,821 --> 01:15:04,069
Is that your buddies
out there, huh?

1342
01:15:04,109 --> 01:15:05,857
Is that who was shooting at us?

1343
01:15:08,614 --> 01:15:10,193
Huh? What do you gotta say?

1344
01:15:13,859 --> 01:15:14,898
Fuck!

1345
01:15:14,948 --> 01:15:17,945
Says right there.
Paratrooper, eight years.

1346
01:15:17,985 --> 01:15:19,653
Two deployments.

1347
01:15:19,693 --> 01:15:21,941
Honorable discharge.

1348
01:15:22,530 --> 01:15:24,608
- This is a fake.
- No, sir.

1349
01:15:25,108 --> 01:15:27,316
- This your girl?
- I just met her.

1350
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:28,444
What's his name?

1351
01:15:29,114 --> 01:15:30,572
I don't know.

1352
01:15:30,612 --> 01:15:31,941
His name is Karl Greene.

1353
01:15:32,191 --> 01:15:33,779
I wasn't asking you,
I was asking her.

1354
01:15:33,819 --> 01:15:35,487
You just said,
"What's his name?"

1355
01:15:35,527 --> 01:15:38,235
You're lucky I haven't broken
your fuckin' neck, yet.

1356
01:15:38,275 --> 01:15:39,613
Okay.

1357
01:15:39,653 --> 01:15:41,981
All right, man. I see
what you're trying to do.

1358
01:15:42,031 --> 01:15:44,608
I'm not gonna cause
any trouble, okay?

1359
01:15:45,697 --> 01:15:48,275
But I'm not gonna lie
down for you, either.

1360
01:15:51,611 --> 01:15:53,030
What are you doin'
in Detroit, huh?

1361
01:15:54,279 --> 01:15:56,856
Like everybody else,
I'm lookin' for work.

1362
01:15:57,525 --> 01:15:58,814
Left one war zone
and joined another.

1363
01:15:58,864 --> 01:15:59,943
Yeah.

1364
01:16:00,612 --> 01:16:03,110
All right. Get this
motherfucker back in line.

1365
01:16:03,150 --> 01:16:04,898
Give me back my
government card, man.

1366
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:44,448
Why don't you get outta here?

1367
01:16:44,488 --> 01:16:46,606
Run out the back door. Run.

1368
01:16:47,485 --> 01:16:48,944
Right now, go!

1369
01:16:58,524 --> 01:17:00,572
You know the one
who was praying?

1370
01:17:00,612 --> 01:17:02,320
He's okay, it's not him.

1371
01:17:03,439 --> 01:17:05,238
And you can scratch
off G. I. Joe.

1372
01:17:05,278 --> 01:17:07,905
That little twerp with
the big, fuckin' prayer.

1373
01:17:07,945 --> 01:17:09,613
Yeah, it's not him.

1374
01:17:10,822 --> 01:17:14,318
That leaves us with the big
motherfucker who's in that room.

1375
01:17:14,358 --> 01:17:15,647
I like him for it.

1376
01:17:16,526 --> 01:17:18,025
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1377
01:17:25,647 --> 01:17:26,776
Flynn.

1378
01:17:31,282 --> 01:17:32,360
Fuck!

1379
01:17:36,157 --> 01:17:37,485
He's escaped.

1380
01:17:38,444 --> 01:17:39,733
Well, we need another one.

1381
01:17:39,773 --> 01:17:40,782
I know.

1382
01:17:56,696 --> 01:17:58,864
Still... Still no gun.

1383
01:18:00,522 --> 01:18:02,191
So, who wants to go next?

1384
01:18:05,108 --> 01:18:06,906
Please, please, please.

1385
01:18:08,814 --> 01:18:10,612
Please. Just, please, please.

1386
01:18:11,611 --> 01:18:13,779
Officer, can I say something?

1387
01:18:16,197 --> 01:18:17,655
There we go.

1388
01:18:17,695 --> 01:18:19,194
Yes, you can.

1389
01:18:21,441 --> 01:18:23,609
I think you have
the wrong house.

1390
01:18:26,027 --> 01:18:27,865
'Cause nobody we saw...

1391
01:18:29,114 --> 01:18:31,941
'Cause nobody we saw here
was shooting at the police.

1392
01:18:34,318 --> 01:18:35,607
Please.

1393
01:18:38,774 --> 01:18:40,982
It's possible we made a mistake.

1394
01:18:43,859 --> 01:18:46,157
But I need to know for sure.

1395
01:18:47,275 --> 01:18:49,273
Can't let a cop killer
get away with it, can I?

1396
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:54,608
Please, please.

1397
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:04,278
How about you, sweetheart?

1398
01:19:08,194 --> 01:19:10,442
- You wanna be next?
- No.

1399
01:19:12,031 --> 01:19:13,569
No, I don't, please.

1400
01:19:13,609 --> 01:19:15,737
- I think you know something.
- I don't.

1401
01:19:15,777 --> 01:19:17,985
- You wanna just die now...
- No.

1402
01:19:18,025 --> 01:19:19,323
Or watch me kill
the others first?

1403
01:19:19,363 --> 01:19:21,941
Which one, huh? Which one?

1404
01:19:26,696 --> 01:19:30,113
Get her outta here.
Jesus! And her! Up!

1405
01:19:30,153 --> 01:19:31,321
Upstairs!

1406
01:19:31,361 --> 01:19:32,820
No!

1407
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:41,941
Shut up!

1408
01:19:41,981 --> 01:19:43,819
You wanna cry, huh?

1409
01:19:43,859 --> 01:19:45,068
Jesus Christ!

1410
01:19:45,108 --> 01:19:46,406
You wanna cry?

1411
01:19:46,446 --> 01:19:47,655
I'll give you something
to cry about.

1412
01:19:47,695 --> 01:19:49,483
Watch them. This one's
coming with me.

1413
01:19:49,523 --> 01:19:50,782
Shut up!

1414
01:19:51,281 --> 01:19:53,110
You wanna cry, huh? I'll give
you something to cry about.

1415
01:19:53,439 --> 01:19:54,988
Leave her alone!

1416
01:20:03,189 --> 01:20:05,657
I guess there are no
weapons on your person.

1417
01:20:09,863 --> 01:20:12,280
Stay over there and keep quiet.

1418
01:20:15,777 --> 01:20:17,106
God.

1419
01:20:18,274 --> 01:20:19,983
Aren't you ashamed
of yourselves?

1420
01:20:20,023 --> 01:20:21,781
You're the one
checking out my tits.

1421
01:20:21,821 --> 01:20:23,609
You're having sex with niggers.

1422
01:20:23,649 --> 01:20:24,858
It's 1967, asshole.

1423
01:20:25,357 --> 01:20:26,606
Honestly.

1424
01:20:27,615 --> 01:20:29,403
It doesn't bother you?

1425
01:20:29,443 --> 01:20:31,151
The Afro Sheen in their hair?

1426
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:33,899
The way it smells?

1427
01:20:33,949 --> 01:20:35,397
You're on some trip.

1428
01:20:35,447 --> 01:20:38,814
You think you can come into my city
and pimp out a bunch of young girls?

1429
01:20:38,864 --> 01:20:40,732
I said it wasn't like that.

1430
01:20:41,941 --> 01:20:43,899
I don't care if you
were in the army.

1431
01:20:43,949 --> 01:20:46,566
I'll drown all you pimps in the
river until the city's clean.

1432
01:20:46,606 --> 01:20:49,733
You gonna question them or I'm
gonna take 'em outta here.

1433
01:20:49,773 --> 01:20:51,361
Just hold on.

1434
01:20:55,107 --> 01:20:56,156
Look.

1435
01:20:58,194 --> 01:21:01,321
You might not be such
bad girls after all.

1436
01:21:01,781 --> 01:21:03,649
But be straight with me.

1437
01:21:03,689 --> 01:21:05,607
Who was shootin' at the
National Guard out there?

1438
01:21:07,525 --> 01:21:08,524
Mister?

1439
01:21:10,112 --> 01:21:12,610
I didn't see anybody shoot
at the National Guard.

1440
01:21:12,650 --> 01:21:14,608
I would tell you if I had.

1441
01:21:15,607 --> 01:21:16,946
You would?

1442
01:21:18,944 --> 01:21:22,780
You can think I'm a slut if you
want, but I was raised right.

1443
01:21:25,657 --> 01:21:27,655
All right. I'm gonna
get 'em outta here.

1444
01:21:28,614 --> 01:21:30,692
Let's get you covered up, okay?

1445
01:21:36,446 --> 01:21:37,695
You too.

1446
01:21:44,068 --> 01:21:45,067
Come on.

1447
01:21:51,781 --> 01:21:53,569
Hey, can I get a hand?

1448
01:22:00,532 --> 01:22:01,651
Fuck.

1449
01:22:01,691 --> 01:22:02,900
Fuck those fuckers.

1450
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:04,278
You're fucking
murdering those kids!

1451
01:22:04,318 --> 01:22:06,156
Why don't you stop them?

1452
01:22:06,736 --> 01:22:09,233
This animal did it too.
He shot one of them!

1453
01:22:09,273 --> 01:22:10,982
Don't concern yourself.
They're just scaring them.

1454
01:22:11,031 --> 01:22:12,190
It's an interrogation tactic.

1455
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:14,238
Are you nuts, Mister?
I saw the bodies!

1456
01:22:14,278 --> 01:22:16,156
Those guys are getting
murdered in cold blood.

1457
01:22:24,198 --> 01:22:26,196
I didn't really shoot the guy.

1458
01:22:29,523 --> 01:22:31,531
It's not real.

1459
01:22:31,571 --> 01:22:34,318
I didn't shoot that guy,
and neither did the other.

1460
01:22:34,358 --> 01:22:37,235
It's to get the guys to fess up
about the location of the gun.

1461
01:22:39,113 --> 01:22:41,441
Who said they even had a gun?

1462
01:22:41,691 --> 01:22:42,690
I don't know.

1463
01:22:46,406 --> 01:22:50,232
If they did, it was just a
toy. It wasn't a real gun.

1464
01:22:56,276 --> 01:22:58,234
Well, thanks for saving us.

1465
01:22:59,403 --> 01:23:00,442
We gotta head out.

1466
01:23:03,279 --> 01:23:05,067
Are we safe here?

1467
01:23:05,737 --> 01:23:08,194
She means, are you gonna tell
the police where we are?

1468
01:23:09,193 --> 01:23:10,402
No.

1469
01:23:23,279 --> 01:23:24,278
Karen.

1470
01:23:25,237 --> 01:23:27,235
We're gonna be okay.

1471
01:23:27,275 --> 01:23:28,943
But those boys...

1472
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:35,857
Fucking stay there.

1473
01:23:35,907 --> 01:23:37,565
You see that? See that shit?

1474
01:23:37,615 --> 01:23:39,653
That is your fault right
there. Look at it.

1475
01:23:39,693 --> 01:23:42,240
You don't talk, that's
what happens. Look at it.

1476
01:23:50,941 --> 01:23:52,190
At ease.

1477
01:23:55,107 --> 01:23:56,816
That kid. Him.

1478
01:23:56,856 --> 01:23:59,443
He was up there in the same room
as those other two delinquents.

1479
01:24:01,441 --> 01:24:04,488
Yeah. Let's get our confession out of
him, vacate the premises, all right?

1480
01:24:04,897 --> 01:24:07,115
- Okay.
- Demens should do it.

1481
01:24:07,865 --> 01:24:08,943
Do what?

1482
01:24:09,403 --> 01:24:10,612
You haven't killed a nigger yet.

1483
01:24:13,109 --> 01:24:14,947
Well, I don't know about that.

1484
01:24:15,946 --> 01:24:17,365
Sure you do.

1485
01:24:18,864 --> 01:24:21,071
What's the matter,
partner? Problem?

1486
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:24,897
Whatever you say. Which one?

1487
01:24:30,272 --> 01:24:32,740
Come with me. I gotta
ask you some questions.

1488
01:24:33,609 --> 01:24:35,067
Please.

1489
01:24:35,107 --> 01:24:37,735
Please don't kill me, please.

1490
01:24:39,773 --> 01:24:41,571
Please don't shoot me, please.

1491
01:24:41,611 --> 01:24:43,739
Where is the gun?

1492
01:24:43,779 --> 01:24:45,817
I don't know. Please.

1493
01:24:45,856 --> 01:24:48,903
I don't know. I swear to God,
I don't know. Please. Please.

1494
01:24:48,943 --> 01:24:50,652
I got no cause to shoot you.

1495
01:24:50,692 --> 01:24:52,030
Please don't shoot. Please.

1496
01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:53,359
Where's the gun?

1497
01:24:53,399 --> 01:24:54,698
Please don't shoot me, man.

1498
01:24:54,738 --> 01:24:56,816
I ain't never shot anybody
before in my life.

1499
01:24:57,275 --> 01:24:59,773
Please! I don't know
where... Please.

1500
01:25:00,692 --> 01:25:01,781
Please, don't...

1501
01:25:06,106 --> 01:25:07,565
Turn around.

1502
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:13,609
They fucking killed him.

1503
01:25:22,740 --> 01:25:24,568
So that's done.

1504
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:26,356
Good. Great job.

1505
01:25:26,406 --> 01:25:28,194
I didn't think I could
do it, but I did it.

1506
01:25:29,443 --> 01:25:31,071
Boy, I feel funny.

1507
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:35,407
Yeah. It's the right
thing. He'll talk now.

1508
01:25:36,026 --> 01:25:37,195
What do you mean?

1509
01:25:42,110 --> 01:25:43,858
Another one bites the dust.

1510
01:25:44,947 --> 01:25:47,525
I bet some of you thought
we weren't serious, huh?

1511
01:25:47,565 --> 01:25:50,652
Well, we still don't have our gun and
we are running out of time, people.

1512
01:25:50,692 --> 01:25:52,070
Who was the sniper?

1513
01:25:54,777 --> 01:25:57,615
Just be honest with us
so we can all go home.

1514
01:26:05,737 --> 01:26:07,405
You shot him, Demens.

1515
01:26:07,445 --> 01:26:08,694
Yeah, I got him.

1516
01:26:11,361 --> 01:26:12,650
Jesus Christ, Marty.

1517
01:26:12,690 --> 01:26:14,318
We weren't actually
shooting the other guys.

1518
01:26:14,358 --> 01:26:15,607
We're playing with them.

1519
01:26:15,906 --> 01:26:17,025
What do you mean?

1520
01:26:17,445 --> 01:26:18,444
Playing.

1521
01:26:18,773 --> 01:26:19,902
Playing what?

1522
01:26:19,942 --> 01:26:21,191
A game.

1523
01:26:22,690 --> 01:26:25,567
A game to get them to talk,
scare the shit out of 'em.

1524
01:26:25,607 --> 01:26:26,905
Interrogation tactics.

1525
01:26:26,945 --> 01:26:28,234
Fuck.

1526
01:26:29,573 --> 01:26:31,611
This is strictly
police business.

1527
01:26:37,774 --> 01:26:40,192
Hey, boys, let's move out.

1528
01:26:40,232 --> 01:26:42,739
Have you got... You
don't have a knife.

1529
01:26:42,779 --> 01:26:44,698
- Fuck me.
- Oh, fuck.

1530
01:26:44,737 --> 01:26:45,776
Okay, listen. Listen.

1531
01:26:47,025 --> 01:26:48,234
- Listen to me.
- Oh, fuck.

1532
01:26:48,274 --> 01:26:51,730
He grabbed your gun, all right,
and you warned him, okay?

1533
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:55,147
And you were forced to shoot
him, okay? Line of duty.

1534
01:26:55,197 --> 01:26:56,656
- Get your fucking story straight.
- Oh, fuck.

1535
01:26:56,696 --> 01:26:59,403
Hey, get your head
straight. I'm serious.

1536
01:26:59,443 --> 01:27:00,861
All right, just take a minute.

1537
01:27:01,441 --> 01:27:02,530
Stay here.

1538
01:27:05,357 --> 01:27:06,446
Oh, God.

1539
01:27:06,905 --> 01:27:07,944
Oh, fuck.

1540
01:27:16,945 --> 01:27:18,693
- Marty shot the guy.
- What?

1541
01:27:19,772 --> 01:27:20,861
- He did?
- Yeah.

1542
01:27:21,401 --> 01:27:22,530
Point blank.

1543
01:27:24,947 --> 01:27:26,526
We need to wrap this up
and get out of here.

1544
01:27:28,614 --> 01:27:29,822
We don't have a suspect.

1545
01:27:30,532 --> 01:27:32,689
Should we just arrest them all?

1546
01:27:32,739 --> 01:27:35,487
No, no, not now. We just need
to get out of here, you know?

1547
01:27:36,606 --> 01:27:38,024
And... Us and them.

1548
01:27:38,943 --> 01:27:41,611
If they're smart, they're not
gonna say anything, all right?

1549
01:27:44,947 --> 01:27:46,406
All right. Let's do this.

1550
01:27:47,864 --> 01:27:48,943
You come with me.

1551
01:27:58,064 --> 01:27:59,193
Listen to me.

1552
01:28:00,072 --> 01:28:01,191
You're free to go.

1553
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:04,857
But you don't talk about
this to anyone, ever.

1554
01:28:06,446 --> 01:28:07,615
You understand?

1555
01:28:07,654 --> 01:28:09,073
'Cause I got your name,

1556
01:28:10,112 --> 01:28:11,441
and I know exactly who you are.

1557
01:28:12,989 --> 01:28:14,278
I don't got your name.

1558
01:28:15,856 --> 01:28:17,275
I don't know nothin' about you.

1559
01:28:21,111 --> 01:28:23,189
Please don't kill me.

1560
01:28:25,197 --> 01:28:26,446
Please don't kill him.

1561
01:28:28,194 --> 01:28:29,403
What's this here?

1562
01:28:33,948 --> 01:28:35,447
I don't see nothin'.

1563
01:28:41,531 --> 01:28:42,779
All right.

1564
01:28:44,398 --> 01:28:45,696
Get going.

1565
01:29:15,357 --> 01:29:17,485
Hey, we don't know nothin'.

1566
01:29:18,693 --> 01:29:20,022
We don't know nothin'.

1567
01:29:25,567 --> 01:29:27,445
No, no, no, no!

1568
01:29:29,483 --> 01:29:30,532
Relax.

1569
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:33,029
Listen.

1570
01:29:34,198 --> 01:29:37,195
What if I told you you can
run out that door right now,

1571
01:29:38,863 --> 01:29:40,821
but you never talk about
what you saw here?

1572
01:29:46,316 --> 01:29:47,814
Understand?

1573
01:29:47,864 --> 01:29:50,941
Please don't kill him.
Please don't kill him.

1574
01:30:05,237 --> 01:30:06,655
No, no, no!

1575
01:30:10,941 --> 01:30:12,320
Listen to me.

1576
01:30:17,734 --> 01:30:19,403
What do you see here?

1577
01:30:24,278 --> 01:30:25,696
You killed him.

1578
01:30:27,235 --> 01:30:28,404
You killed him.

1579
01:30:34,068 --> 01:30:35,606
We're gonna try this again.

1580
01:30:43,029 --> 01:30:44,448
I don't see anything.

1581
01:30:57,115 --> 01:30:58,733
There's a dead guy right there.

1582
01:31:39,522 --> 01:31:40,731
Halt!

1583
01:31:44,447 --> 01:31:46,236
Please, please, please...

1584
01:31:46,276 --> 01:31:48,114
Please, please, please...

1585
01:31:52,190 --> 01:31:53,189
Hey.

1586
01:31:53,778 --> 01:31:54,987
Hey.

1587
01:31:55,317 --> 01:31:56,735
Oh, my God.

1588
01:31:57,195 --> 01:31:58,613
Who could do this to someone?

1589
01:31:59,153 --> 01:32:02,400
Hey, hey, hey. I'm here
to help you, all right?

1590
01:32:02,939 --> 01:32:04,857
Come on. Hey.

1591
01:32:05,486 --> 01:32:07,155
I'm gonna get you to
the hospital, okay?

1592
01:32:07,195 --> 01:32:08,653
All right? Relax.

1593
01:32:10,861 --> 01:32:12,529
Okay? Hey, hey, it's all right.

1594
01:32:15,606 --> 01:32:17,275
Come with me. Come on.

1595
01:32:18,523 --> 01:32:20,611
Come on. Come on. We're
gonna get you there.

1596
01:32:20,651 --> 01:32:21,900
Come on, brother.

1597
01:32:26,905 --> 01:32:31,031
Don't you go on me, all
right? Come on. Come on.

1598
01:32:37,155 --> 01:32:38,194
We got him.

1599
01:32:38,983 --> 01:32:40,072
Let's go.

1600
01:33:06,695 --> 01:33:08,154
Aubrey! Phone call!

1601
01:33:09,822 --> 01:33:11,111
Aubrey, hey!

1602
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:13,069
You got phone call!

1603
01:33:13,109 --> 01:33:15,027
- Say again?
- You got a call from home.

1604
01:33:17,364 --> 01:33:18,403
Something's wrong.

1605
01:33:18,443 --> 01:33:20,531
Kid's in trouble or
hurt, or something.

1606
01:33:20,571 --> 01:33:21,860
Bet it's my youngest.

1607
01:33:25,067 --> 01:33:26,445
He's always googy-googy.

1608
01:33:33,149 --> 01:33:34,397
Yes?

1609
01:33:36,196 --> 01:33:37,364
<i>Well, Aubrey...</i>

1610
01:33:39,572 --> 01:33:43,279
They found Aubrey dead this
morning at the Algiers Motel.

1611
01:33:46,905 --> 01:33:50,282
No. No. Aubrey's
supposed to be at home.

1612
01:33:54,317 --> 01:33:55,776
It's got to be somebody else.

1613
01:34:31,111 --> 01:34:32,529
What is this, Ma?

1614
01:34:33,568 --> 01:34:34,907
A mistake?

1615
01:34:36,275 --> 01:34:37,774
It's got to be a mistake.

1616
01:34:39,193 --> 01:34:40,781
Aubrey's got more
sense than that.

1617
01:34:42,190 --> 01:34:44,817
Well, baby, you never know.

1618
01:34:45,776 --> 01:34:47,115
Let's go see.

1619
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:00,361
Dismukes?

1620
01:36:00,691 --> 01:36:01,780
Is he there?

1621
01:36:09,402 --> 01:36:11,190
Looking for a Dismukes.

1622
01:36:13,149 --> 01:36:14,447
Appreciate it.

1623
01:36:17,155 --> 01:36:18,983
Any of you fellas
named Dismukes?

1624
01:36:19,902 --> 01:36:21,190
Yeah, that's me.

1625
01:36:21,820 --> 01:36:23,398
I have to ask you to
come with us, sir.

1626
01:36:25,696 --> 01:36:27,115
Is there a problem?

1627
01:36:27,984 --> 01:36:30,032
No. I don't think so.

1628
01:36:30,321 --> 01:36:31,940
Rather not have to
ask again, though.

1629
01:36:34,277 --> 01:36:35,946
Y'all tell the boss.

1630
01:36:37,944 --> 01:36:39,232
You got this?

1631
01:36:43,238 --> 01:36:45,067
- Take care of yourself.
- This way.

1632
01:36:54,357 --> 01:36:55,656
Come on, I ain't got all day.

1633
01:37:32,489 --> 01:37:33,738
Take a seat.

1634
01:38:19,572 --> 01:38:20,731
I'm sorry, I...

1635
01:38:21,190 --> 01:38:23,448
I assume this is about
what went on at the motel?

1636
01:38:24,277 --> 01:38:25,446
What happened at the motel?

1637
01:38:26,735 --> 01:38:28,273
If you don't know,
I'll tell you.

1638
01:38:28,613 --> 01:38:30,941
I was working security
by Wisconsin.

1639
01:38:31,820 --> 01:38:33,898
And on Tuesday night,
we heard gunfire

1640
01:38:33,948 --> 01:38:36,445
coming from the area
near the Algiers.

1641
01:38:36,775 --> 01:38:38,113
In that direction.

1642
01:38:39,072 --> 01:38:41,860
Police was there. State
police, National Guard.

1643
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:43,068
It was a lot of shooting.

1644
01:38:45,316 --> 01:38:47,614
And when I went in there,
three kids had been killed.

1645
01:38:47,904 --> 01:38:49,072
No.

1646
01:38:49,362 --> 01:38:51,280
- Yes, sir.
- This right there, right?

1647
01:38:51,820 --> 01:38:53,278
Is that what you're
talking about?

1648
01:38:56,655 --> 01:38:58,363
Yes, sir. Yeah.

1649
01:38:59,022 --> 01:39:01,820
He was lying just like
this. The blood was fresh.

1650
01:39:02,569 --> 01:39:03,858
It hadn't congealed yet.

1651
01:39:04,947 --> 01:39:07,274
So they were killed right
before you got there?

1652
01:39:09,902 --> 01:39:11,030
Yes, sir.

1653
01:39:13,448 --> 01:39:16,445
You carry a .38, right?

1654
01:39:23,948 --> 01:39:26,155
A revolver. Do you
carry a revolver?

1655
01:39:26,195 --> 01:39:27,484
I do have a .38.

1656
01:39:29,652 --> 01:39:31,030
You ever shoot anyone?

1657
01:39:31,070 --> 01:39:32,609
- No.
- Strike anyone?

1658
01:39:34,527 --> 01:39:36,655
- Not the way you mean, sir.
- What do I mean?

1659
01:39:45,486 --> 01:39:46,905
Fellas,

1660
01:39:46,944 --> 01:39:48,823
you know, sometimes,

1661
01:39:48,863 --> 01:39:51,280
when a black guy's put in
a position of authority,

1662
01:39:52,439 --> 01:39:55,736
other black guys, they like
to single you out, okay?

1663
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:57,943
Because I'm not supposed
to tell 'em what to do.

1664
01:39:59,862 --> 01:40:01,650
When we have these
conversations,

1665
01:40:02,689 --> 01:40:04,777
we do them in stages, okay?

1666
01:40:06,275 --> 01:40:08,653
Stage one, witnesses.

1667
01:40:09,822 --> 01:40:11,400
Stage two, suspects.

1668
01:40:12,439 --> 01:40:13,898
What stage are we in?

1669
01:40:15,196 --> 01:40:16,485
You don't know what
stage we're in?

1670
01:40:16,525 --> 01:40:17,983
No. Could you specify for me?

1671
01:40:18,363 --> 01:40:19,782
Yeah, we're in stage two.

1672
01:40:22,149 --> 01:40:23,488
You're a suspect.

1673
01:40:27,024 --> 01:40:28,323
I didn't do it.

1674
01:40:28,902 --> 01:40:31,820
- The police...
- Here we go.

1675
01:40:34,567 --> 01:40:36,115
The police shot those kids.

1676
01:40:36,155 --> 01:40:37,774
See, how the hell
do you know that

1677
01:40:38,443 --> 01:40:42,319
when you weren't inside the building
until after the shooting stopped?

1678
01:40:42,359 --> 01:40:44,906
So, are you lying to us now,

1679
01:40:45,736 --> 01:40:48,363
or were you lying
just a minute ago?

1680
01:40:48,403 --> 01:40:49,941
That's a good
question, Detective.

1681
01:40:51,780 --> 01:40:53,198
You need to think real hard.

1682
01:40:54,237 --> 01:40:55,486
You need to answer me.

1683
01:40:57,564 --> 01:41:00,191
All due respect, I am
telling the truth.

1684
01:41:00,231 --> 01:41:01,740
I'm not lying.

1685
01:41:02,489 --> 01:41:05,566
I told you what I saw.
I saw these kids...

1686
01:41:06,275 --> 01:41:08,073
- Melvin.
- Okay. Okay.

1687
01:41:08,113 --> 01:41:10,231
- We're here to help you, okay?
- Yes, sir.

1688
01:41:10,281 --> 01:41:12,069
Melvin, do you wanna go home?

1689
01:41:12,109 --> 01:41:13,148
Yeah.

1690
01:41:13,198 --> 01:41:14,737
Can we let him think about it?

1691
01:41:14,777 --> 01:41:17,444
- Yeah.
- You think about it, okay, Melvin?

1692
01:41:20,571 --> 01:41:22,239
I didn't do it.

1693
01:41:37,194 --> 01:41:38,942
<i>Number four, step forward.</i>

1694
01:41:45,486 --> 01:41:47,774
You're doing a real
good job, honey.

1695
01:42:31,150 --> 01:42:32,699
Eddie...

1696
01:42:32,739 --> 01:42:34,277
Has he woken up?

1697
01:42:34,317 --> 01:42:35,656
No, man.

1698
01:42:39,402 --> 01:42:40,481
Hey.

1699
01:42:41,070 --> 01:42:42,529
Larry.

1700
01:42:42,569 --> 01:42:44,147
Hey, wake up, brother.

1701
01:42:44,607 --> 01:42:45,696
Hey.

1702
01:42:46,235 --> 01:42:47,444
Be gentle.

1703
01:42:53,148 --> 01:42:55,406
It's all right, man. It's us.

1704
01:42:57,404 --> 01:42:59,322
You know where my
little brother is?

1705
01:43:01,030 --> 01:43:02,649
The police are
saying Fred is dead,

1706
01:43:02,699 --> 01:43:04,407
but I can't get nobody to
tell me what's going on.

1707
01:43:07,524 --> 01:43:08,822
What's going on?

1708
01:43:09,861 --> 01:43:11,610
You tell us, man.

1709
01:43:17,024 --> 01:43:18,403
The police...

1710
01:43:19,322 --> 01:43:20,651
The police?

1711
01:43:20,691 --> 01:43:22,149
The police...

1712
01:43:24,067 --> 01:43:25,276
They...

1713
01:43:44,607 --> 01:43:47,444
- You have children?
- Yes. I have three boys.

1714
01:43:48,483 --> 01:43:51,610
The oldest is twelve.
Then nine and seven.

1715
01:43:51,859 --> 01:43:53,737
You know how
youngsters are then.

1716
01:43:53,777 --> 01:43:55,156
Oh, boy...

1717
01:43:56,155 --> 01:43:59,442
The way they communicate,
grunts and groans.

1718
01:44:00,151 --> 01:44:01,440
My little cavemen.

1719
01:44:01,490 --> 01:44:02,948
Especially boys.

1720
01:44:03,817 --> 01:44:05,735
It's like they don't know if
they wanna be slick, you know?

1721
01:44:05,775 --> 01:44:07,314
That's right.

1722
01:44:07,364 --> 01:44:09,861
They're still trying to
find their place in life

1723
01:44:09,901 --> 01:44:11,440
and we have to allow for that.

1724
01:44:16,565 --> 01:44:17,943
Oh, yes.

1725
01:44:22,529 --> 01:44:23,947
Well,

1726
01:44:24,607 --> 01:44:26,485
I can see you want
to go back there.

1727
01:44:29,652 --> 01:44:30,730
Sure.

1728
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:53,108
<i>We helped put out fires.</i>

1729
01:44:53,148 --> 01:44:56,405
<i>We helped try to keep the riots
down and keep the corner clear.</i>

1730
01:44:56,445 --> 01:44:57,773
<i>What can you say</i>

1731
01:44:57,823 --> 01:45:00,780
<i>about having all this
murdering and confusion?</i>

1732
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:03,947
<i>Everybody isn't thieves
and murderers.</i>

1733
01:45:04,776 --> 01:45:08,732
<i>I wish that things could be
better for the negro people.</i>

1734
01:45:18,363 --> 01:45:19,861
Just...

1735
01:45:19,901 --> 01:45:22,189
Remember what I told you, and this
whole thing's gonna blow over.

1736
01:45:22,239 --> 01:45:24,856
All right? You did
nothing wrong.

1737
01:45:29,442 --> 01:45:30,900
I think I got to say somethin'.

1738
01:45:34,447 --> 01:45:36,065
Hey. You made...

1739
01:45:40,571 --> 01:45:41,739
Demens.

1740
01:45:42,239 --> 01:45:44,197
Something that took one minute

1741
01:45:44,237 --> 01:45:46,694
should not define
your entire life.

1742
01:45:46,734 --> 01:45:47,943
You understand?

1743
01:45:50,650 --> 01:45:52,239
You made a mistake.

1744
01:45:52,738 --> 01:45:54,157
You say what you need to say,

1745
01:45:55,985 --> 01:45:57,194
and you move on.

1746
01:45:57,524 --> 01:45:59,072
That's how you get
out of this thing.

1747
01:46:00,860 --> 01:46:02,529
- All right?
- All right.

1748
01:46:03,777 --> 01:46:04,856
All right?

1749
01:46:04,906 --> 01:46:07,234
Yeah. You don't have to lecture
me, I know what to do.

1750
01:46:07,274 --> 01:46:08,652
There you go.

1751
01:46:10,610 --> 01:46:12,319
You were doing your job.

1752
01:46:22,898 --> 01:46:24,736
You first, knucklehead!

1753
01:46:27,693 --> 01:46:28,822
All right.

1754
01:46:59,781 --> 01:47:00,820
Flynn!

1755
01:47:26,694 --> 01:47:27,773
All right. Let's go, ladies.

1756
01:47:33,947 --> 01:47:35,815
I'll be with you
in a few minutes.

1757
01:47:45,775 --> 01:47:47,194
Well?

1758
01:47:48,023 --> 01:47:49,821
Some things were said in there.

1759
01:47:50,231 --> 01:47:52,109
Such as?

1760
01:47:54,776 --> 01:47:57,773
You stupid... You
motherfucker, you're dead.

1761
01:47:57,823 --> 01:47:59,322
You're fucking dead.

1762
01:48:03,527 --> 01:48:04,946
You too?

1763
01:48:06,025 --> 01:48:07,943
We're all going down.

1764
01:48:11,150 --> 01:48:13,447
Phil, listen. It's...

1765
01:48:13,777 --> 01:48:14,816
- No. No.
- Just listen to me.

1766
01:48:14,856 --> 01:48:16,564
- Get the fuck out of my way.
- Phil!

1767
01:48:38,363 --> 01:48:40,361
I got nothing to say
without my union lawyer.

1768
01:48:40,820 --> 01:48:42,568
Are you kidding me,
you racist fuck?

1769
01:48:42,608 --> 01:48:44,357
Get out of the car before
I break your neck.

1770
01:48:52,109 --> 01:48:54,197
I couldn't say for sure who
went inside the building first.

1771
01:48:57,653 --> 01:49:00,400
There were five,

1772
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:02,778
maybe six state police.

1773
01:49:02,818 --> 01:49:05,026
We have complete statements
from your partners.

1774
01:49:06,444 --> 01:49:08,942
We know you shot those kids.

1775
01:49:09,651 --> 01:49:11,030
So just go from there.

1776
01:49:13,148 --> 01:49:15,985
No. No. I don't
recall doing that.

1777
01:49:18,073 --> 01:49:19,731
Bang his head against
the table. Might help.

1778
01:49:20,031 --> 01:49:21,190
Hey.

1779
01:49:22,568 --> 01:49:24,157
I'm trying to help here.

1780
01:49:24,946 --> 01:49:26,115
I'm trying to be thorough.

1781
01:49:27,573 --> 01:49:28,902
So, you wanna know

1782
01:49:28,942 --> 01:49:30,780
how many state police
were on the scene,

1783
01:49:31,609 --> 01:49:32,648
how many National Guard?

1784
01:49:32,698 --> 01:49:35,775
I can't tell if you're
stupid or smart,

1785
01:49:36,235 --> 01:49:37,903
but I'm willing to find out.

1786
01:49:38,482 --> 01:49:39,821
Don't say another word.

1787
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:41,489
Come on.

1788
01:49:42,199 --> 01:49:43,647
What's the point?

1789
01:49:43,697 --> 01:49:45,405
Coercive testimony
will be tossed.

1790
01:49:54,107 --> 01:49:55,485
Larry!

1791
01:50:01,030 --> 01:50:02,488
Yo, you sure he's home?

1792
01:50:02,528 --> 01:50:03,697
Give him a minute.

1793
01:50:07,823 --> 01:50:09,941
Man, what? What's so important?

1794
01:50:10,610 --> 01:50:12,239
The record company called, baby!

1795
01:50:12,698 --> 01:50:14,736
They wanna hear our
music at the studio!

1796
01:50:14,776 --> 01:50:16,155
And they called you?

1797
01:50:16,195 --> 01:50:18,942
Yeah, man. They said they tried to call
you but you never called them back.

1798
01:50:18,982 --> 01:50:21,280
This is what we've
been working for, man.

1799
01:50:21,319 --> 01:50:22,858
They wanna hear The Dramatics!

1800
01:50:23,357 --> 01:50:25,565
So what? You Mr.
Show Business now?

1801
01:50:25,615 --> 01:50:27,323
This isn't professional.

1802
01:50:27,903 --> 01:50:30,071
Call at business hours,
not 3:00 in the morning.

1803
01:50:31,150 --> 01:50:32,398
But Larry...

1804
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:35,985
Larry! It's a record company, man.
They don't keep banking hours.

1805
01:50:36,564 --> 01:50:37,863
Come on.

1806
01:50:52,488 --> 01:50:55,775
<i>Listen, you guys had better
sound good because I'm broke.</i>

1807
01:50:58,113 --> 01:50:59,192
Let me hear that blend.

1808
01:51:01,609 --> 01:51:03,108
Yes, sir.

1809
01:51:03,148 --> 01:51:04,856
- Are you guys ready?
- Yeah.

1810
01:51:05,815 --> 01:51:09,361
One, two. One, two, three, four.

1811
01:51:09,611 --> 01:51:12,988
<i>Look in my eyes And
don't you see water</i>

1812
01:51:13,028 --> 01:51:15,525
<i>And it's all because of you</i>

1813
01:51:16,774 --> 01:51:20,231
<i>Well look at me I ain't
acting like I oughta</i>

1814
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:23,447
<i>And it's all because of you</i>

1815
01:51:31,190 --> 01:51:33,108
George, can we get a minute?

1816
01:51:34,696 --> 01:51:36,025
<i>- Come on.
- Yeah, hurry back.</i>

1817
01:51:45,485 --> 01:51:48,482
Look, what is in your head, man?
'Cause you ain't singin' in there.

1818
01:51:48,522 --> 01:51:50,191
How am I supposed to sing
with what happened to Fred?

1819
01:51:50,900 --> 01:51:52,448
Look, you just do it.

1820
01:51:52,488 --> 01:51:54,107
Sing while my boy is lying dead?

1821
01:51:55,106 --> 01:51:57,693
Look, a song ain't
words on a page, man.

1822
01:51:57,733 --> 01:51:59,152
That ain't music.

1823
01:51:59,192 --> 01:52:00,530
Music is what you put into it

1824
01:52:00,570 --> 01:52:01,989
and you can make that
whatever you want.

1825
01:52:02,029 --> 01:52:04,067
I'm not singing so white
motherfuckers can dance!

1826
01:52:04,107 --> 01:52:05,985
Well, them pale motherfuckers
ain't dancing for free!

1827
01:52:09,781 --> 01:52:11,899
Since when do you care if
white folks dance anyway?

1828
01:52:24,276 --> 01:52:26,155
<i>During the week of
rioting in Detroit,</i>

1829
01:52:26,194 --> 01:52:28,692
<i>three Negros were shot to
death in a motel room.</i>

1830
01:52:29,231 --> 01:52:31,359
<i>Police and the Guardsmen
had raided the motel,</i>

1831
01:52:31,399 --> 01:52:32,698
<i>searching for snipers.</i>

1832
01:52:33,197 --> 01:52:34,776
<i>Later, witnesses
to the shootings</i>

1833
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:36,984
<i>said the three Negros
had been lined up</i>

1834
01:52:37,024 --> 01:52:39,571
<i>and shot in cold blood
by the officers.</i>

1835
01:52:40,530 --> 01:52:42,858
<i>Today, two police
officers were arrested</i>

1836
01:52:42,898 --> 01:52:44,356
<i>and charged with the murders</i>

1837
01:52:44,406 --> 01:52:46,654
<i>of two of the Negros
shot in the motel.</i>

1838
01:52:46,694 --> 01:52:48,652
<i>The officers, one with
two years' service,</i>

1839
01:52:48,692 --> 01:52:49,941
<i>the other with four</i>

1840
01:52:49,981 --> 01:52:51,939
<i>and no previous
misconduct charges,</i>

1841
01:52:52,278 --> 01:52:54,067
<i>were ordered held without bail.</i>

1842
01:52:54,107 --> 01:52:55,945
<i>They pleaded not guilty.
Their attorney said</i>

1843
01:52:55,985 --> 01:52:58,482
<i>the arrests were a
shame and a pity.</i>

1844
01:52:58,522 --> 01:53:00,360
<i>Police Commissioner,
Ray Girardin,</i>

1845
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:02,398
<i>refused to discuss the
facts of the case,</i>

1846
01:53:02,448 --> 01:53:04,027
<i>except to say the
two officers...</i>

1847
01:53:04,776 --> 01:53:06,484
Who do you got mail for?

1848
01:53:06,524 --> 01:53:08,113
Larry Cleveland Reed?

1849
01:53:08,572 --> 01:53:09,571
Larry!

1850
01:53:18,272 --> 01:53:20,900
Larry, you got a letter.
From the government.

1851
01:53:27,074 --> 01:53:28,822
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1852
01:54:16,154 --> 01:54:18,152
<i>I didn't do nothin'!
I didn't do nothin'!</i>

1853
01:54:18,782 --> 01:54:20,150
<i>- Lie down.
- Please, man!</i>

1854
01:54:20,190 --> 01:54:22,148
<i>I will kill you one by one</i>

1855
01:54:22,398 --> 01:54:26,194
<i>until you tell me exactly
what is going on here.</i>

1856
01:54:26,904 --> 01:54:29,611
<i>Don't look at me. Turn around.</i>

1857
01:54:30,110 --> 01:54:31,649
<i>Start praying!</i>

1858
01:54:31,689 --> 01:54:33,357
<i>Get down! Get up!</i>

1859
01:54:33,697 --> 01:54:35,565
<i>Get the fuck up! Get up!</i>

1860
01:54:36,564 --> 01:54:38,652
<i>Bullshit! Stop
fucking lying to me!</i>

1861
01:54:38,692 --> 01:54:40,150
<i>Carl ain't got no gun.</i>

1862
01:54:40,190 --> 01:54:41,399
<i>One of the guests is dead.</i>

1863
01:54:41,439 --> 01:54:43,067
<i>Please don't shoot. Please.</i>

1864
01:54:43,107 --> 01:54:44,276
<i>Where's the gun?</i>

1865
01:54:44,316 --> 01:54:45,485
<i>Please don't shoot me, man!</i>

1866
01:54:46,694 --> 01:54:48,272
<i>Officer, can I say something?</i>

1867
01:54:48,782 --> 01:54:50,570
<i>I think you have
the wrong house.</i>

1868
01:54:50,610 --> 01:54:52,648
<i>In the Algiers Motel case,</i>

1869
01:54:52,698 --> 01:54:54,526
<i>both the prosecution
and the defense</i>

1870
01:54:54,566 --> 01:54:56,064
<i>in their opening statements</i>

1871
01:54:56,114 --> 01:54:59,231
<i>reminded the all-white jury
of the racial violence</i>

1872
01:54:59,281 --> 01:55:01,189
<i>that seared Detroit
two summers ago.</i>

1873
01:55:01,239 --> 01:55:03,697
<i>Now, Mr. Reed, before the police</i>

1874
01:55:03,737 --> 01:55:06,114
<i>or military personnel
started firing,</i>

1875
01:55:07,024 --> 01:55:10,030
<i>to your knowledge, had
there been any sniper fire</i>

1876
01:55:10,070 --> 01:55:12,608
<i>from inside the Algiers
Motel or annex?</i>

1877
01:55:13,817 --> 01:55:15,195
No.

1878
01:55:15,525 --> 01:55:18,942
And did you see anyone
in the motel that night

1879
01:55:18,982 --> 01:55:20,780
with a gun of any
kind in their hand

1880
01:55:20,820 --> 01:55:23,317
outside of police officers
or military personnel?

1881
01:55:26,154 --> 01:55:29,691
I saw someone shoot a toy
gun at one of his friends.

1882
01:55:31,989 --> 01:55:33,447
A toy gun.

1883
01:55:38,022 --> 01:55:39,441
Mr. Reed.

1884
01:55:40,030 --> 01:55:42,108
Isn't it a fact that your head

1885
01:55:42,608 --> 01:55:44,606
was against the wall for
most of the evening?

1886
01:55:44,985 --> 01:55:46,404
No, sir, it is not.

1887
01:55:47,073 --> 01:55:49,691
My hands were against the
wall for most of the evening.

1888
01:55:49,731 --> 01:55:51,069
That's a fact.

1889
01:55:51,109 --> 01:55:52,148
I asked about your head.

1890
01:55:53,857 --> 01:55:56,734
My head is attached to my neck.

1891
01:55:57,653 --> 01:56:01,109
It moves. This way, and that.

1892
01:56:03,737 --> 01:56:07,733
And yet, it cannot
turn completely around

1893
01:56:07,773 --> 01:56:09,191
to see what's behind you?

1894
01:56:10,740 --> 01:56:13,737
Unless you have a special skill
this courtroom should know about?

1895
01:56:15,905 --> 01:56:19,571
You said you saw the flash
before you heard the gunshot.

1896
01:56:20,110 --> 01:56:21,399
Was that your testimony?

1897
01:56:22,648 --> 01:56:24,276
Well, it was pretty confusing.

1898
01:56:24,316 --> 01:56:25,565
Well, which is it?
Which came first?

1899
01:56:25,615 --> 01:56:26,904
Did you see the flash?

1900
01:56:26,943 --> 01:56:28,902
When did you hear the
body hit the floor?

1901
01:56:28,942 --> 01:56:30,070
I can't say for sure.

1902
01:56:30,110 --> 01:56:31,948
You said you were just
outside the door.

1903
01:56:32,488 --> 01:56:34,816
You also said you
might be confused,

1904
01:56:35,315 --> 01:56:36,983
that you don't know
what point in time

1905
01:56:37,023 --> 01:56:38,072
these things happened.

1906
01:56:38,112 --> 01:56:39,861
So, are you confused?

1907
01:56:40,900 --> 01:56:42,398
I saw the flash, just
through the door.

1908
01:56:42,448 --> 01:56:43,857
What I need to know is,

1909
01:56:43,907 --> 01:56:45,445
did you see Aubrey Pollard

1910
01:56:45,485 --> 01:56:47,363
make a threatening
move toward my client?

1911
01:56:47,403 --> 01:56:50,570
Or are you perhaps confused
on that point as well?

1912
01:56:58,532 --> 01:56:59,731
Yes, sir.

1913
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:02,448
Being a military man,

1914
01:57:02,488 --> 01:57:03,906
you would be able to distinguish

1915
01:57:03,946 --> 01:57:06,064
between the uniforms of
a National Guardsman

1916
01:57:06,114 --> 01:57:08,482
and that of a Detroit police
officer. Is that correct?

1917
01:57:08,981 --> 01:57:10,240
I suppose.

1918
01:57:10,280 --> 01:57:11,529
And so you say

1919
01:57:11,569 --> 01:57:13,737
that the man who took one of
the victims into the room,

1920
01:57:13,777 --> 01:57:15,904
that he was a
National Guardsman?

1921
01:57:15,944 --> 01:57:17,483
So I presume you
know that because

1922
01:57:17,523 --> 01:57:19,861
he was wearing a uniform
of the National Guard.

1923
01:57:19,900 --> 01:57:23,107
Well, yes. I saw a guy in
uniform take him back there.

1924
01:57:23,906 --> 01:57:26,194
Did you see anybody else
go back into that room?

1925
01:57:26,943 --> 01:57:28,192
No.

1926
01:57:28,782 --> 01:57:30,899
Would you have been able to see

1927
01:57:30,939 --> 01:57:32,698
if anybody else went
back into that room?

1928
01:57:33,147 --> 01:57:36,484
At the time, wasn't your
head turned back around

1929
01:57:36,524 --> 01:57:37,653
by the police officers

1930
01:57:37,693 --> 01:57:39,321
that were still standing
there with you?

1931
01:57:41,819 --> 01:57:42,987
Yes.

1932
01:57:43,697 --> 01:57:45,115
And so in one of the lineups,

1933
01:57:45,155 --> 01:57:47,573
when you were asked to identify
the officers who beat you,

1934
01:57:47,613 --> 01:57:49,111
who did you identify?

1935
01:57:49,151 --> 01:57:50,989
Do you see him here
today in court?

1936
01:57:53,737 --> 01:57:54,776
Him.

1937
01:57:55,944 --> 01:57:57,193
And him.

1938
01:57:58,981 --> 01:58:01,069
You just identified two
of the defendants.

1939
01:58:01,988 --> 01:58:03,737
Why would you identify
only one of them

1940
01:58:03,777 --> 01:58:04,905
at the time of the lineup

1941
01:58:04,945 --> 01:58:07,233
if both of them took
part in beating you?

1942
01:58:07,273 --> 01:58:09,031
Which recollection
for the record

1943
01:58:09,071 --> 01:58:10,820
would you say is the
correct recollection?

1944
01:58:10,859 --> 01:58:12,608
I just said I couldn't
tell at first.

1945
01:58:12,648 --> 01:58:14,696
When I went down to the police
station, I was very nervous.

1946
01:58:14,736 --> 01:58:16,774
And so now, you are calm?

1947
01:58:17,613 --> 01:58:19,691
And you will not be changing
your story again then?

1948
01:58:20,650 --> 01:58:22,398
This is it? This is the one
you want us to work with?

1949
01:58:22,448 --> 01:58:23,817
Objection. Asked and answered.

1950
01:58:23,856 --> 01:58:25,235
Overruled.

1951
01:58:25,275 --> 01:58:27,443
<i>So, you were led into a room,
and then what happened?</i>

1952
01:58:30,899 --> 01:58:32,817
He fired off a shot by
my head and told me...

1953
01:58:33,986 --> 01:58:35,695
To keep my mouth
shut and lay still.

1954
01:58:36,564 --> 01:58:38,072
Or the next one for real.

1955
01:58:38,112 --> 01:58:39,441
And what did you do?

1956
01:58:41,739 --> 01:58:43,027
I lie still.

1957
01:58:43,447 --> 01:58:45,655
And were you mistreated
in any way after that?

1958
01:58:46,734 --> 01:58:47,862
Mistreated?

1959
01:58:47,902 --> 01:58:49,231
Have you ever been
arrested, sir?

1960
01:58:53,946 --> 01:58:55,155
Sure.

1961
01:58:55,195 --> 01:58:56,903
Ever spent a night in jail?

1962
01:58:58,782 --> 01:58:59,940
Yeah.

1963
01:58:59,990 --> 01:59:01,649
How many times have
you been arrested?

1964
01:59:01,699 --> 01:59:04,526
- I don't know.
- How many nights and days have you spent

1965
01:59:04,566 --> 01:59:06,064
in prison for crimes
you've committed...

1966
01:59:06,114 --> 01:59:07,323
I don't know, a few...

1967
01:59:07,363 --> 01:59:08,402
Or alleged to have committed?

1968
01:59:08,442 --> 01:59:09,731
Criminal acts.

1969
01:59:12,857 --> 01:59:14,486
I don't know. A few.

1970
01:59:16,154 --> 01:59:17,942
Are you certain?

1971
01:59:17,982 --> 01:59:19,571
Yeah, you don't forget
a beating like that.

1972
01:59:20,400 --> 01:59:22,568
So you're certain
that these three men

1973
01:59:23,107 --> 01:59:24,696
beat you and the others?

1974
01:59:26,823 --> 01:59:28,192
Yes, I'm certain.

1975
01:59:29,611 --> 01:59:31,489
Up until some army guy
pulled me in a room

1976
01:59:31,529 --> 01:59:33,197
and told me to lie still.

1977
01:59:33,237 --> 01:59:35,235
Then you heard him go out
and tell them I was dead.

1978
01:59:35,275 --> 01:59:36,654
And this is what's
being referred to

1979
01:59:36,694 --> 01:59:38,112
as the "death game"?

1980
01:59:38,981 --> 01:59:40,530
What did you see next?

1981
01:59:41,988 --> 01:59:44,316
I didn't see nothin' lying
face down on the floor,

1982
01:59:44,356 --> 01:59:46,234
but I heard Aubrey
yell, "Don't shoot."

1983
01:59:46,274 --> 01:59:48,072
And he shot. I heard that.

1984
01:59:53,567 --> 01:59:54,735
Your witness, council.

1985
01:59:54,775 --> 01:59:57,403
Now we've already talked
to your cohort about,

1986
01:59:57,443 --> 01:59:59,651
friend, Lee, about
his criminal past.

1987
01:59:59,691 --> 02:00:01,149
Have you ever had
trouble with the law?

1988
02:00:02,698 --> 02:00:04,236
I'm not on trial here.

1989
02:00:04,276 --> 02:00:06,114
No need to introduce
a new crime, sir.

1990
02:00:06,154 --> 02:00:07,523
Just the ones already known.

1991
02:00:09,531 --> 02:00:11,359
Or maybe you can
start by telling us,

1992
02:00:11,399 --> 02:00:13,147
how did the night begin?

1993
02:00:13,197 --> 02:00:14,566
Party? A few drinks?

1994
02:00:14,606 --> 02:00:16,694
Man, why? Why y'all
talking about me at all?

1995
02:00:17,443 --> 02:00:20,240
Man, y'all see a black man in court
and assume I'm the one on trial.

1996
02:00:20,280 --> 02:00:22,238
Man, they killed
my friends, man!

1997
02:00:22,278 --> 02:00:23,277
They beat us!

1998
02:00:23,946 --> 02:00:26,524
Lined us up and abused us and
y'all doing the same thing!

1999
02:00:26,943 --> 02:00:29,611
There's no justice here,
man. Go fuck yourself, man.

2000
02:00:35,155 --> 02:00:36,863
- Man, no, get off of me!
- Take him out.

2001
02:00:36,903 --> 02:00:37,982
This is bullshit!

2002
02:00:38,022 --> 02:00:39,780
What? What you lookin' at?

2003
02:00:41,359 --> 02:00:42,777
This is bullshit!

2004
02:00:44,815 --> 02:00:46,574
I think what is clear
here, Your Honor,

2005
02:00:46,614 --> 02:00:49,571
is that these men were under
an intolerable situation.

2006
02:00:49,611 --> 02:00:52,737
They were under this duress,
which we say was inherent,

2007
02:00:52,777 --> 02:00:54,606
and for that reason,
had no other choice.

2008
02:00:54,656 --> 02:00:55,774
All right.

2009
02:00:55,814 --> 02:00:57,613
All they had to do
was keep quiet.

2010
02:00:57,653 --> 02:00:59,730
If they kept quiet, they
wouldn't be here today.

2011
02:01:00,110 --> 02:01:01,569
But they made a statement,

2012
02:01:01,609 --> 02:01:03,237
and that statement
should be admissible.

2013
02:01:03,277 --> 02:01:05,115
Not if they were made
under duress, Your Honor.

2014
02:01:05,155 --> 02:01:07,113
Not if the taking
of those statements

2015
02:01:07,153 --> 02:01:09,031
violates constitutional rights.

2016
02:01:10,739 --> 02:01:13,157
These policemen were
owed an obligation.

2017
02:01:14,486 --> 02:01:17,273
Advising them that they had
a right to remain silent,

2018
02:01:17,692 --> 02:01:19,401
they had a right to counsel,

2019
02:01:19,441 --> 02:01:21,698
and that anything they said
could be used against them

2020
02:01:21,738 --> 02:01:23,197
in a court of law.

2021
02:01:23,527 --> 02:01:25,115
I don't think these defendants,

2022
02:01:25,155 --> 02:01:27,193
<i>because they're police officers,</i>

2023
02:01:27,233 --> 02:01:29,780
<i>have any right to expect
anything more from us,</i>

2024
02:01:30,440 --> 02:01:32,238
<i>but they have a right
under the Constitution</i>

2025
02:01:32,278 --> 02:01:33,736
<i>not to settle for anything less.</i>

2026
02:01:34,606 --> 02:01:39,031
I therefore rule the
statements inadmissible.

2027
02:01:39,780 --> 02:01:41,609
Wasn't that just a
load of bullshit.

2028
02:01:43,107 --> 02:01:44,526
Wow, man.

2029
02:01:44,945 --> 02:01:46,114
That was...

2030
02:01:46,154 --> 02:01:47,613
You know as well I do,

2031
02:01:48,572 --> 02:01:50,530
those kids shouldn't have
been killed like that.

2032
02:01:52,108 --> 02:01:53,607
Yeah. It's a shame.

2033
02:01:57,363 --> 02:01:59,151
Should've complied
with a lawful order

2034
02:01:59,191 --> 02:02:00,779
and relinquish their weapons.

2035
02:02:03,567 --> 02:02:05,155
But you're a solid guy though.

2036
02:02:06,274 --> 02:02:07,523
Really.

2037
02:03:02,448 --> 02:03:04,775
They know what they're
supposed to do.

2038
02:03:16,024 --> 02:03:18,112
Jury entering. All rise.

2039
02:03:25,774 --> 02:03:27,363
All rise.

2040
02:03:43,237 --> 02:03:45,564
Has the jury reached a
verdict in this matter,

2041
02:03:45,614 --> 02:03:47,862
with regard to the
charges of murder

2042
02:03:47,902 --> 02:03:49,780
in the first degree and assault?

2043
02:03:50,240 --> 02:03:51,818
We have, Your Honor.

2044
02:03:52,607 --> 02:03:54,196
On the assault,

2045
02:03:54,945 --> 02:03:56,194
not guilty.

2046
02:04:01,778 --> 02:04:03,447
As to the murder charges,

2047
02:04:08,282 --> 02:04:09,441
not guilty.

2048
02:04:17,612 --> 02:04:20,899
What we have witnessed today is a
disappointment to the justice system,

2049
02:04:20,939 --> 02:04:22,068
to the state of Michigan.

2050
02:04:22,108 --> 02:04:24,156
<i>Excuse me, would you
like to comment?</i>

2051
02:04:24,196 --> 02:04:26,523
This wouldn't have happened
if they had found black girls

2052
02:04:26,573 --> 02:04:28,192
in a hotel with white men.

2053
02:04:28,232 --> 02:04:30,240
<i>No, sir. No way
would they do this</i>

2054
02:04:30,280 --> 02:04:31,858
<i>to white men. That's the truth!</i>

2055
02:04:31,898 --> 02:04:33,067
And I don't care who knows it!

2056
02:04:33,107 --> 02:04:36,404
Thank you, ma'am. Mr. Pollard, how
do you feel about losing your son?

2057
02:04:36,444 --> 02:04:37,732
How do you think he feels?

2058
02:04:37,772 --> 02:04:39,480
How would you feel?
How would you feel?

2059
02:04:40,240 --> 02:04:41,698
It's a terrible pain.

2060
02:04:42,777 --> 02:04:44,525
- A pain that never goes away.
- Come on.

2061
02:04:44,565 --> 02:04:45,734
Thanks, man.

2062
02:04:45,774 --> 02:04:47,233
<i>Listen, sir, will you
conduct yourself</i>

2063
02:04:47,273 --> 02:04:48,531
<i>with a little bit of empathy?</i>

2064
02:04:48,571 --> 02:04:49,900
<i>We are here today to witness</i>

2065
02:04:49,940 --> 02:04:51,488
the justice system at
work and we demand

2066
02:04:51,528 --> 02:04:54,865
that police criminality be
treated the exact same way

2067
02:04:54,905 --> 02:04:56,573
as any other form
of criminality.

2068
02:04:56,613 --> 02:04:57,862
<i>Some people would say it's wrong</i>

2069
02:04:57,902 --> 02:04:59,361
<i>to judge the police
for doing their jobs.</i>

2070
02:04:59,401 --> 02:05:00,649
<i>Nice try.</i>

2071
02:05:00,689 --> 02:05:02,068
<i>- You have my statement.
- What a shame.</i>

2072
02:05:02,108 --> 02:05:04,196
<i>Police criminality
needs to be treated</i>

2073
02:05:04,236 --> 02:05:07,193
<i>the same as any other
form of criminality.</i>

2074
02:05:24,106 --> 02:05:28,322
<i>Some people are
made of plastic</i>

2075
02:05:29,361 --> 02:05:34,445
<i>You know some people
are made of wood</i>

2076
02:05:36,114 --> 02:05:40,399
<i>Some people have
hearts of stone</i>

2077
02:05:42,907 --> 02:05:46,114
<i>- Some people are up to
no good -Some people</i>

2078
02:05:47,862 --> 02:05:49,151
<i>But baby</i>

2079
02:05:50,529 --> 02:05:52,068
<i>I'm for real</i>

2080
02:05:54,276 --> 02:05:57,942
<i>I'm as real as real can get</i>

2081
02:05:59,940 --> 02:06:04,775
<i>And if what you're looking
for is real lovin'</i>

2082
02:06:05,774 --> 02:06:07,442
<i>Then what you see</i>

2083
02:06:08,232 --> 02:06:09,940
<i>Is what you get</i>

2084
02:06:11,818 --> 02:06:13,606
We have a contract, Larry.

2085
02:06:15,774 --> 02:06:17,612
We got to snatch this, brother.

2086
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:21,818
Not like this.

2087
02:06:21,858 --> 02:06:24,775
Look, Motown is a
black-only company.

2088
02:06:24,815 --> 02:06:26,324
But you know what I mean.

2089
02:06:26,903 --> 02:06:28,941
Who listens to this music?

2090
02:06:32,198 --> 02:06:34,066
This ain't easy for me, man.

2091
02:06:40,899 --> 02:06:43,027
We all a long way from easy.

2092
02:06:46,443 --> 02:06:48,112
Well, then you do what you need.

2093
02:06:49,740 --> 02:06:50,899
I'm gonna lay low.

2094
02:06:52,447 --> 02:06:53,776
Come on, man.

2095
02:09:06,573 --> 02:09:08,231
- Excuse me, brother.
- Yes, son.

2096
02:09:08,731 --> 02:09:11,238
I submitted an application for
the church choir director

2097
02:09:11,278 --> 02:09:12,737
and I never heard anything back.

2098
02:09:14,235 --> 02:09:15,524
Speak to the choirmaster.

2099
02:09:16,733 --> 02:09:17,942
Okay, thank you.

2100
02:09:21,738 --> 02:09:23,196
Excuse me.

2101
02:09:23,236 --> 02:09:25,404
I submitted an application for
the church choir director

2102
02:09:25,444 --> 02:09:27,402
and I never heard anything back.

2103
02:09:27,442 --> 02:09:28,611
Larry Cleveland Reed.

2104
02:09:29,031 --> 02:09:30,489
Larry.

2105
02:09:30,529 --> 02:09:32,737
I remember. You're with
The Dramatics, right?

2106
02:09:32,777 --> 02:09:33,986
Yes, sir.

2107
02:09:34,026 --> 02:09:35,904
You're a little bit
overqualified.

2108
02:09:35,944 --> 02:09:38,571
We're just a
neighborhood church.

2109
02:09:38,611 --> 02:09:41,238
Well, yeah, I am
overqualified. So?

2110
02:09:41,278 --> 02:09:43,946
Why don't you go try some
of those clubs downtown?

2111
02:09:43,986 --> 02:09:45,564
I'm sure they'd be
happy to have you.

2112
02:09:45,614 --> 02:09:47,942
And I guarantee you, the
pay will be much better.

2113
02:09:48,941 --> 02:09:50,859
There's police at
those clubs downtown.

2114
02:09:52,607 --> 02:09:54,275
And it's dangerous.

2115
02:09:56,903 --> 02:09:59,031
Sir, can you please
help me? I need a job.

2116
02:10:01,198 --> 02:10:03,946
Do you sing any
liturgical music?

2117
02:10:05,274 --> 02:10:06,903
<i>Yeah, I know something.</i>

2118
02:10:13,107 --> 02:10:14,695
Let me see if I...

2119
02:10:15,404 --> 02:10:16,733

After receiving death threats

2138
02:12:03,576 --> 02:12:05,576
Melvin Dismukes moved to
the suburbs and

2139
02:12:05,600 --> 02:12:07,600
worked as security guard
for department store Sears Roebuck

2140
02:12:07,624 --> 02:12:09,624
Although the three Officers were
found not guilty

2141
02:12:09,648 --> 02:12:11,648
of criminal charges, they
werent returned to active duty

2142
02:12:11,672 --> 02:12:13,672
Years later a civil court ruled
against one of the officers

2143
02:12:13,696 --> 02:12:15,696
He was ordered to pay a fine to Aubrey Pollards family

2144
02:12:15,720 --> 02:12:17,720
of five thousand dollars

2145
02:12:17,744 --> 02:12:19,744
Fred Temples family sued
the city of Detroit
for wrongful death

2146
02:12:19,768 --> 02:12:21,768
As part of the settlement,
 the city did not admit any guilt

2147
02:12:34,092 --> 02:12:36,092
Carl Cooper's starter pistol
 was never found

2148
02:12:37,816 --> 02:12:39,816
Julie Ann Hysel left Detroit

2149
02:12:39,840 --> 02:12:41,840
and worked as a hair dresser
raising four children

2150
02:12:44,864 --> 02:12:46,864
The "Dramatics" broke out
in the seventies with several hits

2151
02:12:46,888 --> 02:12:48,888
and continue to perform to this day

2152
02:12:48,912 --> 02:12:50,912
Larry Cleveland Reed never
rejoined the band

2153
02:12:50,936 --> 02:12:52,936
He still lives in Detroit
singing in a church choir

2154
02:13:07,060 --> 02:13:19,360
The facts around the murders at the Algiers Motel on July 25th 1967
were never conclusively established in a criminal proceeding
As a result, portions of this film were constructed and drmatized
based on recollections of the alleged participants and supporting 
documents
