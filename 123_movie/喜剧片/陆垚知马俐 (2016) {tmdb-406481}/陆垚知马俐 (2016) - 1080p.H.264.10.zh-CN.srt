1
00:00:04,475 --> 00:00:06,543
Huh? Amazing, right?

2
00:00:06,577 --> 00:00:08,590
- Yeah.
- Bathroom.

3
00:00:08,624 --> 00:00:09,609
Bedrooms.

4
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:10,644
Nice.

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,335
Views of other
bedrooms and bathrooms.

6
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:16,307
I really appreciate you
letting me crash here, bud.

7
00:00:16,342 --> 00:00:17,740
Are you kidding?
You're doing us a favor.

8
00:00:17,775 --> 00:00:20,347
No flush Tony
just moved out last week.

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,489
You're sure this
isn't a problem?

10
00:00:22,524 --> 00:00:23,590
Seriously, the best day
of my life

11
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:25,459
was when I heard you got
traded to the rangers.

12
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:27,357
You're family. My place
is your place, man.

13
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,590
Technically, it's my place.

14
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:31,693
Okay, and next time I say,

15
00:00:31,728 --> 00:00:33,662
"hey, let me
help you with that,"

16
00:00:33,696 --> 00:00:36,765
let's try
"no thanks, I got it."

17
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:40,671
You look like an eater.

18
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:42,510
So, just so we're clear,

19
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:43,710
the left side
of the fridge is mine.

<i>( Knocks on door )</i>

21
00:00:45,547 --> 00:00:47,349
I got it.
Tucker, come on.

22
00:00:47,383 --> 00:00:48,783
My brother
and my best friend--

23
00:00:48,818 --> 00:00:50,651
It's never gonna get
any better than this.

24
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:52,355
The three of us together,

25
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:54,390
there's nothing
that's gonna stop us.

26
00:00:58,796 --> 00:01:00,464
Except for maybe that.

27
00:01:03,435 --> 00:01:05,302
There's a baby on my doormat.

Make sure she stays there!

I'm just saying,

37
00:01:39,735 --> 00:01:41,468
for a woman who
just had a baby,

38
00:01:41,503 --> 00:01:42,803
she moves remarkably fast.

39
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:45,606
How could she just
leave her here?

40
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:46,674
Ben, you gotta calm down, okay?

41
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,810
I'm sure she's not even
your baby.

42
00:01:48,845 --> 00:01:50,344
Exactly, it could
just as easily

43
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:51,445
be your baby, right?

44
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:56,483
Not so much, no.

45
00:01:57,485 --> 00:01:58,685
And I've only been
in town an hour.

46
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,421
I mean, I'm fast, but...

47
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:02,621
I'm not that fast.

48
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,290
This is not my baby.

Wait, wait, wait!

50
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:07,625
Guys, we got a note.

51
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,693
Her name's Emma.

52
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,730
I don't know any Emmas.

53
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:14,533
The baby's name is Emma.

54
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:17,536
Hi, Emma.

55
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:20,640
Hey, Ben.
Did I ever tell you

56
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:22,709
about that hot waitress
I went out with named Emma?

57
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:24,511
Danny, focus!

58
00:02:24,546 --> 00:02:25,546
The mother.

59
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,547
- Oh, yeah.
- Who's the mother?

60
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:27,748
Sorry, um,

61
00:02:27,782 --> 00:02:28,782
Angela.

62
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:32,486
Ben and Tucker: Angela!

63
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:34,321
- Of course.
- That's right.

64
00:02:34,356 --> 00:02:35,322
Who is Angela?

65
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:36,557
She was nice. Actress.

66
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:38,558
That girl was crazy.

67
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:41,628
Does it say anything else?

68
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,330
Uh, she's sorry.

69
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,432
She didn't know
what else to do.

70
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:47,733
And she just needs
a little time.

71
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,368
Time? How much time?!

72

<i>( Knocks on door )</i>

73
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,704
And that would be
the perfect amount of time.

74
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:52,705
Oh.

75
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,474
That's Riley.

76
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,675
I gave her a call
while you were outside.

77
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,377
Riley?

78
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:59,412
Fatpants Perrin?

79
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:00,413
What's she doing here?

80
00:03:00,448 --> 00:03:02,383
You have a friend
named Fatpants?

81
00:03:03,619 --> 00:03:05,753
Oh, I'm definitely
marking my food.

82
00:03:05,788 --> 00:03:07,622
No.

83
00:03:07,656 --> 00:03:09,491
Riley's in law school now.

84
00:03:09,525 --> 00:03:10,559
It took her a while.

85
00:03:10,593 --> 00:03:12,327
I guess the LSAT's
kind of tricky,

86
00:03:12,362 --> 00:03:13,762
but trust me, she will
know what to do.

Ben-wetter!

89
00:03:22,507 --> 00:03:23,574
Look at you.

90
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:26,376
You look amazing.

91
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,544
How did that happen?

92
00:03:28,646 --> 00:03:30,414
I may have lost a pound or two.

93
00:03:30,448 --> 00:03:31,448
Hundred.

94
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,750
You sat on my head and gave me

95
00:03:33,784 --> 00:03:35,519
a concussion, remember?

96
00:03:35,553 --> 00:03:37,754
Tuck, Riley.
Riley, Tucker.

Hi.

98
00:03:39,357 --> 00:03:40,557
Riley grew up across
the street from us

99
00:03:40,592 --> 00:03:41,658
and used to kick
the crap out of Ben

100
00:03:41,693 --> 00:03:42,793
every day of his life.

101
00:03:42,828 --> 00:03:44,762
Oh, and congrats
on the law school thing.

102
00:03:44,797 --> 00:03:46,397
- Thanks.
- Don't worry--I know a bunch

103

of people that had
a hard time getting in.

104

- Ow, ow, ow, ow!
- Why did you tell him that?

I bet you're hungry, huh?

Let's see
what you got--

Is this all you
brought with you?

Oh, well, that's okay.

131

stick the tabs down,

00:06:17,415 --> 00:06:18,615
What if Angela
never comes back?

171
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,783
Oh, my God, taste this.

172
00:06:24,322 --> 00:06:25,623
Yo.

173
00:06:25,657 --> 00:06:28,492
Chicken, carrots, and pasta.

174
00:06:28,526 --> 00:06:30,328
Okay?

175
00:06:30,362 --> 00:06:31,529
All in this little jar.

176
00:06:31,563 --> 00:06:33,431
( Laughs )

177
00:06:33,465 --> 00:06:34,499
It's like, gross,

178
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:35,700
yet oddly delicious.

179
00:06:35,735 --> 00:06:37,636
( Mouths word )

180
00:06:39,506 --> 00:06:41,574
Come on, man.
It's gonna be okay.

181
00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:42,609
How do you know?

182
00:06:42,643 --> 00:06:44,410
I don't, but it's all I got.

183
00:06:45,746 --> 00:06:46,747
Excuse me,

184
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,516
how old is your baby?

185
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:50,651
Oh, um...

186
00:06:50,685 --> 00:06:51,651
That's a good question.

187
00:06:52,754 --> 00:06:54,521
I met Angela at that
party in the village...

188
00:06:54,556 --> 00:06:56,456
- Mm.
- And we dated for maybe six weeks

189
00:06:56,491 --> 00:06:57,457
before we were...

190
00:06:57,492 --> 00:06:58,725
Intimate.

191
00:07:01,762 --> 00:07:02,728
And she broke up with me

192
00:07:02,762 --> 00:07:05,297
pretty much right after that.

193
00:07:05,332 --> 00:07:07,399
I'm sure there was
no correlation.

194
00:07:08,701 --> 00:07:10,368
So, we're into August now,

195
00:07:10,402 --> 00:07:11,736
and they take,
like, nine months

196
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,271
once they're up and running.

197
00:07:13,305 --> 00:07:14,272
I think so.

198
00:07:14,306 --> 00:07:15,305
So...

199
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,410
( Sighs )

200
00:07:22,646 --> 00:07:23,612
Three months.

201
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,448
Three months!

202
00:07:25,482 --> 00:07:26,515
My baby's three months old.

203
00:07:30,553 --> 00:07:31,720
Mm-mm.

204
00:07:31,755 --> 00:07:34,390
- Put this back.
- What?

205
00:07:34,424 --> 00:07:35,391
She ain't got no teeth.

206
00:07:35,425 --> 00:07:36,492
Put it back.

207
00:07:36,527 --> 00:07:37,694
( Softly murmurs )

208
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:39,596
So, the first thing
Ben has to do

209
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,730
is take a paternity test.

210
00:07:40,764 --> 00:07:43,366
( Mouths words )

211
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,667
我想说

212
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:46,669
很明显 这就是他的孩子


213
00:07:48,372 --> 00:07:49,571
一样的笑容

214
00:07:49,606 --> 00:07:50,739
一模一样的耳朵

215
00:07:50,773 --> 00:07:52,574
连眼球上 长的那个闪亮的小斑点

216
00:07:52,608 --> 00:07:53,709
都是一样的

217
00:07:56,646 --> 00:07:58,380
怎么啦？

218
00:07:58,414 --> 00:07:59,447
我鼻子上有什么东西吗

219
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:00,414
我就知道你们觉得这样很可笑

220
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:01,615
但是一点都不

221
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,517
你居然喜欢Ben

222
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:05,318
什么

223
00:08:05,353 --> 00:08:06,453
怎么可能 听起来太疯狂了

224
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,354
我一直都喜欢戏弄他

225
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:09,355
天啊

226
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,557
你是真的喜欢Ben


227
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,259
我们回来咯


228
00:08:13,294 --> 00:08:14,494
嘿 Ben 你肯定不会相信

229
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:15,495
刚刚我才发现Riley

230
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,696
所以你们买的怎么样了

231
00:08:17,732 --> 00:08:19,299
你们刚一走 

232
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,367
我才想到我应该

233
00:08:20,401 --> 00:08:21,368
先给你们一张购物清单

234
00:08:21,403 --> 00:08:22,636
为什么？我的意思是每个人都知道

235
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,504
你不应该给一个

236
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:25,572
还没有四个月大的婴儿买干粮

237
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:26,573
并且还希望她可以自己坐起来

238
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:27,707
刚刚那个女人还真是刻薄

239
00:08:29,711 --> 00:08:31,578
我想我们把该做的都做完了

240
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:33,447
来吧

241
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:34,515
现在只要帮她拍拍背 

242
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:35,582
让她打个嗝就好了

243
00:08:35,617 --> 00:08:36,751
我想你肯定能做好的


244
00:08:36,785 --> 00:08:37,752
什么 我吗 现在 别逗了

245
00:08:37,786 --> 00:08:39,588
这里 tucker


246
00:08:39,622 --> 00:08:41,323


247
00:08:41,357 --> 00:08:42,424
-非常好，danny
-怎么啦？

248
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:43,425
-现在该你来管这个小家伙了
-等等

249
00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:44,560
你不会现在走吧？

250
00:08:44,594 --> 00:08:45,595
-对啊 我正打算走
-别走 我保证我会老实一点的

251
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:47,330
我刚刚已经跟你示范要怎么做了啊


252
00:08:47,364 --> 00:08:48,631
对，可是我没认真看

253
00:08:48,665 --> 00:08:49,665
你不能走 

254
00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:51,400
Ben 快让Riley留下来

255
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:52,467
-你不能走 
-拜拜 

256
00:08:52,502 --> 00:08:54,436
哇哦 Ben

257
00:08:56,338 --> 00:08:57,572
我可从来没注意

258
00:08:57,606 --> 00:08:58,773
你的眼睛有多闪亮

259
00:09:01,743 --> 00:09:03,277
拜托了 Riley

260
00:09:03,311 --> 00:09:04,278
没有你 我们肯定熬不过今天晚上的

261
00:09:04,312 --> 00:09:05,279


262
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:11,284


263
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:16,357
好吧 

264
00:09:16,391 --> 00:09:17,425
我留下来

265
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:18,526


266
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,660


267
00:09:19,695 --> 00:09:22,464
看吧 这就是我正要说的


268
00:09:22,498 --> 00:09:23,632


269
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:24,700
对吧  她没有吐奶在我的衣服上吧

270
00:09:24,734 --> 00:09:25,734


271
00:09:28,371 --> 00:09:29,571
没没，看起来很好

272
00:09:29,606 --> 00:09:31,306
衣服完全跟新的一样 哥们

273
00:09:31,341 --> 00:09:32,541
太好了

274
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,544
我5点应该回得来

275
00:09:46,578 --> 00:09:47,645
等一下 你现在要去哪儿


276
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:49,313
我要去上班了

277
00:09:49,347 --> 00:09:50,480
等等 你难道不能先找个人顶替一下吗


278
00:09:50,515 --> 00:09:52,416
恩 好主意


279
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,417
但现在说太晚了

280
00:09:53,451 --> 00:09:54,418
不 等一下 哥们

281
00:09:54,452 --> 00:09:55,485
我和tuck是肯定不会帮你看孩子的

282
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,187
你哥哥说的很对


283
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,321
我想说没有...

284
00:09:58,355 --> 00:09:59,422
喂

285
00:09:59,456 --> 00:10:01,324
谢谢了老哥，再见


286
00:10:01,358 --> 00:10:03,393
怎么又是这样

287
00:10:08,332 --> 00:10:10,233
 

288
00:10:10,268 --> 00:10:11,234


289
00:10:13,538 --> 00:10:14,538


290
00:10:16,707 --> 00:10:19,210
太棒了

291
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,278
谁说你一无是处的

292
00:10:21,313 --> 00:10:22,546
应该是你吧
 
293
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,351
Riley 我现在到底该怎么办

294
00:10:26,385 --> 00:10:28,486
说真的 在angela回来以前

295
00:10:28,521 --> 00:10:30,655
我们也做不了什么

296
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,224
不过 我觉得我们得讨论一下


297
00:10:32,258 --> 00:10:33,625
家里的那个小胖妞儿

298
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,294
就这一次不是用来形容我

299
00:10:35,328 --> 00:10:36,695


300
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,631
你有想过以后怎么办吗


301
00:10:38,665 --> 00:10:41,501
我真的不知道自己想要什么

302
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,535 
去年 我在帮人家修房子


303
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,636
在那之前 我在餐厅当服务生


304
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:46,638
现在 我又成了个调酒师

305
00:10:46,673 --> 00:10:49,307
我到现在都还没想清楚自己的生活

306
00:10:49,342 --> 00:10:50,308
更何况我又不是你

307
00:10:50,343 --> 00:10:51,476
什么意思
 
308
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,244
拜托


309
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,378
大学

310
00:10:54,412 --> 00:10:55,513
法学院等等

311
00:10:55,547 --> 00:10:57,348
你现在完全变了个人

312
00:10:58,683 --> 00:11:02,186
你知道自己想要什么 而且你一直在为自己想要的努力

313
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,654
是啊 

314
00:11:03,689 --> 00:11:04,689
也不全是

315
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:07,492


316
00:11:07,526 --> 00:11:09,461
冰块掉进我的胸罩里了

317
00:11:09,495 --> 00:11:10,462


318
00:11:10,497 --> 00:11:11,563


319
00:11:11,598 --> 00:11:13,299
我真的很抱歉

320
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,400
以前一直骑你头上


321
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:16,602
Angela回去了

322
00:11:16,637 --> 00:11:17,637
哥们 我现在离开一会儿

323
00:11:18,672 --> 00:11:21,373
很抱歉总是挖苦你

324
00:11:21,408 --> 00:11:22,508
慢慢来 大胖妞儿

325
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:23,542
加油

326
00:11:25,478 --> 00:11:26,545
Angela现在在哪儿

327
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:27,613
首先我要说得是

328
00:11:27,647 --> 00:11:29,381
她把孩子吵醒了

329
00:11:31,417 --> 00:11:32,450
然后她要我给你那个信封

330
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:33,484


331
00:11:33,518 --> 00:11:35,553
你让她走了

332
00:11:35,587 --> 00:11:36,653
你吃错药了吧

333
00:11:36,688 --> 00:11:38,354
不好意思

334
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:40,590
是我的错 

335
00:11:40,624 --> 00:11:42,425
但我当时在全神贯注地帮你照顾孩子

336
00:11:44,561 --> 00:11:46,729
去看信吧 你肯定会开心的

337
00:11:48,265 --> 00:11:49,265
全部都是领养申请

338
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:50,700
她准备让Emma接受领养

339
00:11:50,734 --> 00:11:52,602
并且她想要我放弃Emma的抚养权

340
00:11:55,606 --> 00:11:57,607
如果我签了 我就不用再当爸爸了

341
00:11:57,641 --> 00:11:59,576
太好了 不是吗

342
00:12:01,312 --> 00:12:02,445
看吧 我不是唯一一个

所以我签了以后 
Emma就会有个新的爸爸对吗

346
00:12:16,693 --> 00:12:18,193
差不多是这样

347
00:12:18,228 --> 00:12:19,194
信上说

348
00:12:19,229 --> 00:12:20,296
已经有家庭在等了

349
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,430


350
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:24,301

351
00:12:24,335 --> 00:12:26,236
让她走了

352
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,337
那我就不想再听到这件事了
 
353
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,440
永远也不想再谈论这件事了 好吗

354

-没问题
-好的

我的宝贝外孙在哪儿呢

356
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,317
妈 你来这儿干嘛

357
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:39,418

她来这儿干嘛

360

你跟她说孩子的事了

361
00:12:42,689 --> 00:12:44,556
我甚至都没告诉她 我在你这

362
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:45,624
我待会再找你算账

363

你应该挂个铃铛在身上

这是胶带吗

381

我们是要把她的尿布粘起来

382

You can't begin to understand 你不能理解当父母需要做多大的牺牲

to be a parent.

about this again.

But you've seen
your uncle Danny.

recover from that.

He was so big,

I had to have

Kind of.

Guess I always thought
maybe someday,

461
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,431
but back then I just figured

462
00:16:21,465 --> 00:16:23,266
I was too fat,
or too--

463
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,468
loud, or too hairy, or--

464

Okay, we're not making a list.

Why would I want to do that?

469
00:16:35,147 --> 00:16:36,448
Uh, did you miss
the part in the story

470
00:16:36,482 --> 00:16:37,449
about the baby?

471
00:16:37,483 --> 00:16:39,284
The baby he doesn't
want to give up?

472
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:41,387
If that's true, then why
did he make that call?

473
00:16:41,421 --> 00:16:43,122
Because his entire family

474
00:16:43,157 --> 00:16:45,124
is telling him he can't do it.

475
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:46,125
If nobody believes in him,

476
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
how can he believe in himself?

477
00:16:47,194 --> 00:16:49,029
He can't do it alone.

478
00:16:49,063 --> 00:16:50,230

Vanessa and I
were at the movies

when Ben called and said

Emma's having
some kind of meltdown.

516
00:18:07,441 --> 00:18:09,375
I don't think
Emma's the problem.

if you're not home
