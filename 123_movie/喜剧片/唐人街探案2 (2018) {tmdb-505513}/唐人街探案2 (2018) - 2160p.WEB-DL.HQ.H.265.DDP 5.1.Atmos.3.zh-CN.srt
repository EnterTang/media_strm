It's not a birthday gift for your landlady?

168
00:16:22,717 --> 00:16:23,260

Your right trouser leg was dirtier and they were both worn out.

They are all in Chinese.You are such a loser.

184
00:17:12,258 --> 00:17:17,029

Where else can you go?It's just six more days.

185
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:20,616
你看我不开心 就少看 我再陪你玩六天
If I upset you, you can look away.I'll be with you for six days.

186
00:17:20,767 --> 00:17:22,910
也算是能交差啦
Then my job is done.

187
00:17:23,061 --> 00:17:25,496
明天就陪你去大皇宫
I'll take you to the Grand Palace tomorrow.

188
00:17:29,734 --> 00:17:34,713

Don't lie to me again.I hate liars.

189
00:17:34,864 --> 00:17:36,715
行 行 行 不骗 不骗 不骗
Fine. No more lies.

Go, go, go!

194
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:07,997

Do you think Xiang will kiss me when she sees this?

195
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,459

You should try it, too.You will get cuter.

196

You think I am a loser,don't you?

197

You think you are smarter than me?Fine.

198
00:18:24,664 --> 00:18:27,683
咱俩玩个游戏 互相给对方提问
Let's play a game. Quiz.

199
00:18:27,834 --> 00:18:30,978
我答不出给你五十铢 你答不出给我一百铢
If I lose, I'll give you 50 baht.If you lose, give me 100 baht.

200
00:18:31,129 --> 00:18:33,564

How about that?

201
00:18:33,715 --> 00:18:36,775
你比我聪明嘛 好
Because you are smarter than me.- All right.

202
00:18:36,926 --> 00:18:38,610
你小孩子 你先问

Buy me a coke. Cold one.

208
00:19:04,454 --> 00:19:06,638
别气啦 你看你眉心发红
Don't be upset.It's reddish between your eyes.

209
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,016
马上要走桃花运啦
It means you are getting lucky with the ladies.

210
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:11,393
你印堂发黑
It's blackish at the top of your nose bridge.

222
00:23:17,415 --> 00:23:19,308

226
00:23:31,096 --> 00:23:32,075

Why?

227
00:23:33,075 --> 00:23:34,075
为什么
Why?

228
00:23:37,602 --> 00:23:41,038
你打我 我没打你
You hit me?- No, I didn't.

229
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:46,043
你没打我吗 没啊
You didn't hit me?- No.

230
00:23:46,194 --> 00:23:48,379
为...为什么抓你啊
Why are they after you?

231
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:51,090
他们说我杀人啦 你杀了谁呀
They said I killed someone.- Who did you kill?

232
00:23:51,241 --> 00:23:53,425
我杀了谁呀 你说你杀了谁呀
Who did I kill?- Tell me who you killed.

233
00:23:53,576 --> 00:23:55,928

234
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:58,430
我怎么知道我杀了谁啊
How would I know?

235
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:02,685
黄兰登你什么意思 
Huang Landeng, how can you do something like this?

236
00:24:02,836 --> 00:24:07,815
你不打声招呼就到我的地盘上抓人 还抓我的人 混蛋
You catch my man in my precinct without my knowledge?

237
00:24:07,966 --> 00:24:10,609
你的人 废话
Your man?- Of course.

238
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,487
整个唐人街谁不知道唐仁是我的马仔啊
Everyone in Chinatown knows that Tang Ren is my man.

239
00:24:13,638 --> 00:24:16,156
你问问他们哪一个不知道
You can ask them about it.

240
00:24:16,308 --> 00:24:20,119
你有什么证据抓人 兰登 证据
What's your evidence?- Landeng, the evidence.

241
00:24:25,817 --> 00:24:30,504
三个月前唐人街 四家金行 在一夜之间发生盗窃
Three months ago in Chinatown,four gold shops were burgled.

242
00:24:30,655 --> 00:24:33,549
丢失金条金块一百零一公斤
101 kg of gold has gone missing.

243
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,135
我们最先锁定的盗窃团伙中的一个就是
The first suspect we lock in the robbery gang...

244
00:24:36,328 --> 00:24:39,888
颂帕工坊中的手工匠人 颂帕
...is the craftsman Sompat from Sompat Workshop.

245
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,309
而且我们最后确认 失窃的黄金也藏在他的工坊之中
We have verified that the stolen gold is in his workshop.

246
00:24:44,461 --> 00:24:47,521
四月十五号 我们准备去抓颂帕的时候
On April 15th, when we were about to arrest Sompat...

247
00:24:47,672 --> 00:24:50,733
发现他已经被人杀了
...he was found dead.

248
00:24:50,884 --> 00:24:54,987
死亡的时间是 四月十四日晚上十一点到一点钟
The time of death is from 11 pm to 1 am on April 14th.

249
00:24:55,764 --> 00:24:57,865
我们多次排查
According to our thorough investigation...

250
00:24:58,016 --> 00:25:00,576
能够进入工坊的入口只有一个
...there is only one entrance to his workshop...

251
00:25:00,727 --> 00:25:03,329
那就是工坊正门
...that is the front door.

252
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,081
工坊正门外面有四个监视器
There are four cameras outside the front door.

253
00:25:06,232 --> 00:25:09,877
我们最后排查之后发现 在案发时间内
We found that during the time the murder happened...

254
00:25:10,028 --> 00:25:12,298
唯一进入过现场的人
...the only one who went into the crime scene...

255
00:25:16,117 --> 00:25:17,843
唐仁
...was Tang Ren.

256
00:25:17,994 --> 00:25:19,720
凶器上全都是唐仁的指纹
Tang Ren's finger prints are all over the murder weapon...

257
00:25:19,871 --> 00:25:21,638
而且黄金不翼而飞
...and the gold is gone.

258
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,849
所以我们最后可以断定
So we figure out that...

259
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,060
唐仁 就是五个嫌犯中的小个子
...Tang Ren is the short guy among the five suspects.

260
00:25:26,211 --> 00:25:28,937
他杀害同伴 黑吃黑 谋财害命
He double-crossed his partner and killed him for the gold.

261
00:25:29,089 --> 00:25:32,483
只要我们找到唐仁 就可以找回失窃的黄金
As long as we find Tang Ren,we can retrieve the stolen gold.

262
00:25:32,634 --> 00:25:35,527
成功了没有 成功了
Are we clear?- Yes!

263
00:25:38,682 --> 00:25:42,534
坤SIR 还有什么话要说
Kon, do you still have something to say?

264
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:49,458
不是这里我要声明一下 我跟这个唐仁是没有任何关系的
First of all, I have nothing to do with that Tang Ren.

265
00:25:50,235 --> 00:25:53,921
不是你说整个唐人街的人都知道
I thought you said everyone in Chinatown knows that...

266

...Tang Ren is your man.I heard you are the big boss...

267
00:25:57,909 --> 00:26:00,302
你就是幕后的老板

我警告你不要乱讲话啊 我告你诽谤 你知道吗
Don't you say anything like that.I'll sue you for slander.

我告你诽谤啊
I'll sue you for slander.

270
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,686
他诽谤我呀

271
00:26:07,486 --> 00:26:08,686
他在诽谤我呀
He is slandering me.

272
00:26:20,724 --> 00:26:23,450
你好 泰哥 你

我限你六小时之内 来警局自首
I give you six hours to turn yourself in.

275
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:32,167
泰哥 我 我什么我

276
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:34,253
你千万不要想着跑路啊
Don't run away from this!

277
00:26:34,404 --> 00:26:37,214
你千万不要想着坐走私船离开泰国
Never take a smuggler to leave Thailand...

278
00:26:37,365 --> 00:26:39,508
再转到越南 缅甸 老挝 柬埔寨
...and transfer to Laos,Cambodia, Vietnam and Burma.

279
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:43,595
不要让我见到你 你让我见到你 我分分钟弄死你啊
Never let me see you again!I will eat you alive if I do.

280
00:26:57,594 --> 00:26:59,903
我与罪恶不共戴天
I will not live under the same sky with crimes.

281
00:27:00,055 --> 00:27:02,489
好
Great!

282
00:27:11,024 --> 00:27:13,042
现在怎么办
What should we do now?

283
00:27:13,234 --> 00:27:15,878
我一定要找坤泰问个清楚啊
I have to see Kon Tai and find out what it's about.

284

你自首吧 什么
You should turn yourself in.- What?

285
00:27:19,824 --> 00:27:23,344
自首吧 反正泰国没死刑
Turn yourself in. There is no death sentence in Thailand.

286
00:27:23,495 --> 00:27:27,139
你随便坐四十几年牢就出来了
You only have to serve a sentence of about 40 years.

287
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:29,725
听听 听听你说的是人话吗
Are you listening to yourself?

288
00:27:29,918 --> 00:27:31,810
随便坐四十几年牢
Who wants to be in jail for 40 years?

289
00:27:31,962 --> 00:27:34,855
我可是你舅舅 亲舅舅啊 表的
I am your uncle.- A distant uncle.

290
00:27:35,006 --> 00:27:38,275
血浓于水呀 谁让你杀人了
Blood is thicker than water.- But you are a murderer.

291
00:27:38,426 --> 00:27:42,363
我没杀人啊 你去跟警察说
I am not.- Tell this to the police.

292
00:27:42,514 --> 00:27:44,948
我说他们会听我的吗
Will they listen to me?

293
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,409
本来就没有身份 不犯事还好
I'm not a citizen here.It's all right when I behave.

294
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,912
犯了事 还不是他们说我什么就是什么吗
But once I break the law, they can do whatever they want to me.

295
00:27:50,063 --> 00:27:52,539
我可不想一辈子坐牢啦
I don't want to spend the rest of my life in prison.

296
00:27:52,691 --> 00:27:54,833
坐牢也跟我没关系
It's none of my business.

297
00:27:54,985 --> 00:27:57,544
反正我是不跑了
I don't want to run anymore.

298
00:27:57,696 --> 00:27:59,380
你刚刚袭警了 知道吗
You assaulted the police.

299
00:27:59,531 --> 00:28:01,465
在泰国袭警罪是很大的
It's a felony in Thailand.

300
00:28:01,616 --> 00:28:04,051
至少关你十几年牢啦
You have to stay in jail for at least a dozen of years.

301
00:28:04,202 --> 00:28:06,762
我不知情
I didn't know anything.

302
00:28:07,706 --> 00:28:09,848
你人在泰国 谁管你呀
You are in Thailand now.It's not up to you anymore.

303
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,142
你连中国话都说不利落 谁听你的
You can't speak fluent Mandarin,who would listen to you?

304
00:28:12,294 --> 00:28:15,437
抓住你 先暴打一顿 然后不管你三七二十一 往牢里一扔
They would beat you up and throw you in prison.

305
00:28:15,588 --> 00:28:17,439
你知道泰国什么最多
Do you know what they have most in Thailand?

306
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:20,109
就你这姿色 进去没别的
For a cute guy like you,when you get in jail...

307
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,112
先被十几个大汉 随便轮奸几十遍啦
...you will be gang-raped by a dozen of big guys.

308
00:29:15,356 --> 00:29:18,041
南派莫家拳 承让
Mohist Fist of South Sect!Thank you.

309
00:29:19,068 --> 00:29:22,211

311
00:29:29,703 --> 00:29:32,347
狗日的 你戳我的眼
You scum! You poked my eyes...

312

你还掏 掏我的裆 行了

You are still playing dumb?- I'll give whatever you want.

315
00:29:46,553 --> 00:29:51,157
看来我暗示的还不够明显 我问你金子呢
It seems you didn't take the hint.Where is the gold?

316
00:29:51,308 --> 00:29:54,160
金子在他脖子上呢 脖子
The gold is on his neck.- Neck?

317
00:29:55,896 --> 00:29:58,498
还蛮横的嘛 都是道上的
You look like a tough man.- We are all street boys.

318
00:29:58,649 --> 00:30:01,834
给点面子啦 为什么不完整
Show me some respect.- Why is it incomplete?

319
00:30:01,986 --> 00:30:04,629
纹一半太疼 受不了 就喊停了
I couldn't stand the pain,so I told them to stop.

320
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,048
还纹条残龙 别
A half-baked dragon.- Don't!

321
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:09,467
别什么别 我问的不是这条破链子
Cut it out!It's not the gold I want.

322
00:30:09,618 --> 00:30:14,514
我问你 你把颂帕弄死以后 黄金运哪去了
After you killed Sompat,where did you take the gold?

323
00:30:14,665 --> 00:30:17,809
颂帕是谁啊 你拿人家东西
Who is Sompat?- You took their stuff.

324

你就还给人家 闭嘴 我可是你舅舅啊
Just give it back.- Shut up! I am your uncle here.

325
00:30:21,422 --> 00:30:22,939
原来是舅舅啊
Turns out you are his uncle.

326
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:25,983
不说 我就打死他
Tell us or I'll shoot him.

327
00:30:26,176 --> 00:30:27,860
打死他 我也不知道啊
That won't make me know something I don't.

328
00:30:28,012 --> 00:30:31,197
你快告诉他 我可是你外甥啊
Just tell him. I am your nephew.

329
00:30:31,348 --> 00:30:33,324

我不知道里面是金子啊
I didn't know there was gold inside.

509
00:46:31,892 --> 00:46:35,244
怎么一点儿侦探的样子都没有啊

The van was parked right there.But now it's gone.

518

And I'm your uncle, too.You are inhumane!

只有把凶杀案破了 才能找回黄金
Only after we solve the murder can we find the gold.

806

Nonsense! Do you have any clues?I have been with you these days.

你有个毛线索啊

808
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,806
凶手在哪里呢
Where is the murderer?

809

你连人家什么时候进去杀人 什么时候出来你都不知道
You don't even know when he went in and out.

810
01:14:30,753 --> 01:14:34,564
你别以为你多看了几本侦探小说 就真把自己当神探了吗
You think you are a real detective because you read a few fictions?

811
01:14:35,675 --> 01:14:39,111

I know. Three days later,you will fly home...

816
01:14:59,032 --> 01:15:01,508

你是小唐 我是老秦
You are Tang, and I'm Qin.

823

你别以为我离开你个小毛孩子 我就找不到黄金 破不了案
You think I can't find the gold and solve the case without you?

824
01:15:28,269 --> 01:15:30,412
我还不当你这个保姆了呢
I don't want to be your babysitter anymore.

825
01:15:30,563 --> 01:15:34,374
你以为我愿意陪你这个脑残啊
You think I want to be with a moron like you?

826
01:15:34,525 --> 01:15:38,545

借个火
Give me a light.

831
01:17:47,992 --> 01:17:51,178
你怎么又是一个人在家
Why are you alone at home again?

832
01:17:51,954 --> 01:17:54,347
我爸妈死于一场车祸
My parents died in a car accident.

833

What did he do?- I don't know.

839
01:18:17,146 --> 01:18:19,623
那他是坏人吗
Is he a bad guy?

840
01:18:19,774 --> 01:18:24,419
好 坏 看怎么理解了
Good or bad, it depends.

841

你说话一直这样吗
Do you always talk like this?

842
01:18:27,573 --> 01:18:30,092
我之前就不太说话
I barely talked when I was younger.

843
01:18:30,243 --> 01:18:32,844
现在好多了
I'm better now.

844
01:18:35,248 --> 01:18:37,808
你们为什么要冒充警察
Why did you pose as police?

845
01:18:38,001 --> 01:18:42,479
谁说的 你不是很上镜
Who told you that?- You are not so photogenic.

846
01:18:42,922 --> 01:18:47,484
那你为什么还放我进来 我觉得 你不是坏人
So why did you invite me in?- I don't think you are a bad guy.

847
01:18:47,635 --> 01:18:52,656
可是你们为什么要来找我 丹的爸爸 他一直在跟踪你
But why did you come to me?- Dan's father was stalking you.

848

852
01:19:24,714 --> 01:19:26,606

Dad.

853
01:19:26,758 --> 01:19:30,402

01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:25,160
天灵灵 地灵灵 天都帮不了你

我猜你就在这里啦
I knew you'd be here.

868
01:23:45,767 --> 01:23:47,743
我知道了
I know.

869
01:23:47,894 --> 01:23:51,455
你说 那些录像里 除了我没有其他人进出 对不对
The video footages showed that there was nobodygoing in or out but me, right?

870
01:23:52,606 --> 01:23:52,915
对
Right.

871
01:23:53,067 --> 01:23:56,586
你和警察确定 这里没有其它入口 对不对
You and the police are sure there's no other entrance, right?

872
01:23:57,820 --> 01:24:04,009
对 颂帕 是被这降魔杵打死的
Yes.- Sompat was killed by the vajra.

873
01:24:05,495 --> 01:24:08,555
他会不会 是他做了太多坏事
Is it possible that he did too many evils...

874
01:24:10,106 --> 01:24:11,708
金刚显灵
...and the vajra made its power felt?

875
01:24:11,959 --> 01:24:13,269
金刚来了
The vajra is here!

876
01:24:19,509 --> 01:24:23,111
这么恐怖的事你还笑得出来
How can you laugh at such a creepy thing?

877
01:24:24,555 --> 01:24:27,657
监视器内容 七天会自动覆盖
The footages are automatically overwritten every seven days.

878
01:24:27,809 --> 01:24:30,869
所以呢
So?

879
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:33,455
我不相信什么鬼神
I don't believe in supernatural beings.

880
01:24:33,606 --> 01:24:37,084
唯一的解释 凶手
The only explanation is that the murderer...

881
01:24:37,235 --> 01:24:39,461
一周前就藏在这儿了
...had been hiding here a week before.

882
01:24:39,612 --> 01:24:43,632
什么 一周前就藏在这儿啦 这怎么可能呢
What? Hiding here a week before?How is that possible?

883
01:24:44,701 --> 01:24:48,136
歌野晶午的《求道者密室》
In Shogo Utano's "The Secret Chamber of the Seeker"...

884
01:24:48,287 --> 01:24:51,098
凶手为了杀人 躲在天井里
...the murderer hid in the courtyard for a month...

885
01:24:51,249 --> 01:24:54,643
一个月
...to kill someone.

886
01:24:55,128 --> 01:24:58,397
大哥 那是小说嘛
That's fictional.

887
01:24:58,548 --> 01:25:00,690
福尔摩斯说过
Sherlock Holmes said...

888
01:25:00,842 --> 01:25:02,943
排除所有不可能
...when you have eliminated all which is impossible...

889
01:25:03,094 --> 01:25:07,030
剩下那个多不可思议
...then whatever remains,however improbable...

890
01:25:08,141 --> 01:25:10,659
都是事实真相
...must be the truth.

891
01:25:13,021 --> 01:25:16,456
那他藏在哪里呢 不会被发现吗
So where did he hide?He'd be discovered, wouldn't he?

892
01:25:16,649 --> 01:25:19,376
你还记得丹的房间吗
Do you remember Dan's room?

893
01:25:21,362 --> 01:25:25,799
颂帕不会经常进自己死儿子的房间
Sompat didn't often go to the room of his dead son.

894
01:25:27,243 --> 01:25:29,886
他就躲在丹的床底下
So the murderer hid under Dan's bed.

895
01:25:30,038 --> 01:25:32,931
那个脚印 是他不小心留下的
He left that footprint by accident.

896
01:25:33,082 --> 01:25:35,350
对 可他每天吃什么呢
Yes.- But what did he eat every day?

897
01:25:35,501 --> 01:25:37,894
他的大小便怎么办呢
And what if he wanted to go the bathroom?

898
01:25:38,087 --> 01:25:40,647
颂帕常去咖啡馆 你还记得吧
Sompat often went to the coffee shop, remember?

899
01:25:40,798 --> 01:25:42,858
这个人啊 之前经常来这
This guy used to come here all the time.

900
01:25:43,009 --> 01:25:48,113
自己家里 一直藏着一个 想杀死自己的人
A man who wants to kill you has been hiding in your home.

901
01:25:48,264 --> 01:25:50,282
这想想太恐怖了
It's so creepy just to think of it.

902
01:25:50,433 --> 01:25:52,993
现在我们案件重演
Now let's re-enact the murder.

903
01:25:53,144 --> 01:25:54,911
有这个必要吗
Is it necessary?

904
01:25:55,063 --> 01:25:59,833
要破解罪恶 就必须接近它 甚至成为它
To solve the crime, you have to approach it, or even be it.

905
01:25:59,984 --> 01:26:03,045
我演你 你演颂帕
I'll play you,and you'll play Sompat.

906

908
01:26:15,249 --> 01:26:18,894
我说这话时没结巴 你演你
I didn't stutter.- Fine, you play yourself.

909
01:26:19,045 --> 01:26:21,438
我演颂帕
I'll play Sompat.

910
01:26:21,923 --> 01:26:25,525

停 又停
Stop.- Again?

917
01:27:12,890 --> 01:27:18,286
你确定 他是先给你钱 再给你单子的
Are you sure he paid you before he handed you the note?

918
01:27:23,943 --> 01:27:29,005
对啊 怎么了 他自始至终只跟你说了一个坐
Yes. Why?- All he said to you was "sit"?

919
01:27:29,157 --> 01:27:34,845
没错啊 好 继续
Yes.- Okay. Go on.

920
01:27:58,519 --> 01:28:01,204
停 我就知道啦
Stop.- I knew it.

921
01:28:01,356 --> 01:28:04,207
你走的时候 没看见颂帕
When you left,you didn't see Sompat?

922
01:28:04,359 --> 01:28:07,669
他在工作室里 我只看到他的影子啦
He was in his studio,and all I saw was his silhouette.

923
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:14,926
影子
His silhouette.

924
01:28:31,594 --> 01:28:35,072
你那天看到的 是不是这样的颂帕
The Sompat you saw that day was like this, wasn't he?

925
01:28:40,353 --> 01:28:43,413
对 对 对 就是这个样子
Yes, exactly.

926
01:28:48,111 --> 01:28:49,961
到底怎么回事 凶手在哪里呢
What's going on?Where is the murderer?

927
01:28:50,113 --> 01:28:52,005
凶手就在你眼前 你是凶手
He is right beneath your eyes.- You are the murderer?

928
01:28:52,156 --> 01:28:54,800
对 我是凶手 别闹了你
Yes, I am the murderer.- Stop it!

929
01:28:54,951 --> 01:28:57,803
不是 我演的这个是凶手
No. The man I play is the murderer.

930
01:28:57,996 --> 01:29:00,680
你演的是颂帕 颂帕杀死了自己
You play Sompat.You mean Sompat killed himself?

931
01:29:00,832 --> 01:29:04,184
我知道了 他是自杀
I know. He committed suicide.

932
01:29:04,335 --> 01:29:08,105
神探大哥 你自己砸碎自己后脑勺试试
Detective, try to smash the back of your own head.

933
01:29:09,215 --> 01:29:11,108

So what the heck happened?

934
01:29:11,259 --> 01:29:15,153
你没看清他的脸 对不对 对啊 那灯光太暗了嘛
You didn't see his face clearly.- The light was too dim.

935
01:29:17,473 --> 01:29:20,617
那天是不是这个样子 对啊 就是这个样子啦
Was it like this that day?- Yes, exactly like this.

936
01:29:20,768 --> 01:29:22,536
那是他不想让你看清
He didn't want you to see him clearly...

937
01:29:22,729 --> 01:29:24,705
因为 他根本就不是颂帕
...because he was not Sompat.

938
01:29:24,856 --> 01:29:26,957
 难道他是 凶手
He was...- The murderer.

939
01:29:27,108 --> 01:29:28,875
凶手来啦

你要这个东西干什么
What do you want this for?

958
01:31:45,705 --> 01:31:48,181
这是证据
This is evidence.

959
01:31:51,419 --> 01:31:54,312
查案重要 还是活着重要啊
Which is more important,your life or solving the case?

960
01:31:55,590 --> 01:31:57,816
都重要
They are both important.

961
01:32:03,890 --> 01:32:05,574
走啦
Let's go.

Mr. Yan has blown my cover.I can't stay in Thailand anymore.

965
01:32:40,385 --> 01:32:42,652
对呀 你们耍我啊
Yes.- Are you kidding me?

966
01:32:44,263 --> 01:32:46,740
很简单 我数三声
It's simple. I'll count to three.

967
01:32:46,891 --> 01:32:51,453
告诉我黄金在哪里 不然我一枪打死她
And you tell me where the gold is.Or I'll shoot her.

968
01:32:51,604 --> 01:32:53,580
一 我们真的不知道啊
One.- We really don't know.

969

971
01:32:57,443 --> 01:33:01,755

可怜可怜我吧 我真的很惨的
Have some pity on me.

973

我们几个人 策划了半年多
We spent over six months planning for this.

974
01:33:16,879 --> 01:33:18,688
好不容易黄金到手了 现在什么都没了
And when we finally got the gold,it was gone.

975
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:23,193
现在泰国我 待不下去了
Now I can't stay in Thailand anymore.

976
01:33:23,344 --> 01:33:25,153
我还有妈妈要照顾  我只能跑路
I still have to provide for my mother. I have to leave here.

01:33:34,564 --> 01:33:38,834
我 哦 对 他本来就结巴
I...- Well, he is a stutterer.

981
01:33:38,985 --> 01:33:40,919
这一紧张就更结巴啦
And even more so when he is nervous.

982
01:33:41,070 --> 01:33:43,255
不着急 慢慢来 我等你 大把时间啊
Take it easy. I can wait.I have a lot of time.

01:33:48,161 --> 01:33:51,304
唱歌就不结巴 对 你把想说的都唱出来呀
You won't stutter if you sing.You can sing it out.

986
01:33:51,456 --> 01:33:53,765
我不会唱 唱歌有什么难的
I can't sing.- What's so difficult about that?

987
01:33:53,916 --> 01:33:56,101
我唱一句 你唱一句
Sing along with me.

988
01:33:56,252 --> 01:34:01,064
时光一逝永不回
Time is gone with the wind.

989
01:34:01,215 --> 01:34:03,358
预备 唱
Ready? Sing!

990
01:34:03,801 --> 01:34:09,072
时光一逝 停 停 停
Time is gone...- Stop, stop, stop.

991
01:34:09,223 --> 01:34:11,700

You are out of tune.You're singing it wrong.

992

永不回 对 对 对 好很多了
With the wind.- It sounds better now.

你那个光唱得特别好 你再把那个回再拉得长一点
Your "time" sounds very well.You have to keep "wind" longer.

996
01:34:30,370 --> 01:34:32,304
回 拉长一点儿啦
Wind. Keep it longer.

997
01:34:32,455 --> 01:34:36,600
永不回 回
Gone with the wind.- Wind.

998

Do you think I'm dumb? Am I dumb?This is your last chance.

You are such a loser. No wonder you can't get into college.

1002
01:34:53,643 --> 01:34:55,827
大学就不能要你这个小结巴
No college will admit a little stutterer like you.

1003
01:34:56,270 --> 01:34:58,705
那也比你好 你还侦探呢
I'm better than you.You think you are a detective.

1004
01:34:59,107 --> 01:35:01,583
你就是个老流氓 你敢骂我
You are actually an old hooligan.- How dare you call me that?

1005
01:35:01,734 --> 01:35:03,794
我骂你怎么了 老流氓
So what? You old hooligan!- You little stutterer!

Use DiDi Taxi to take her to the hospital.

1012

还萨瓦迪卡呢 叫救护车
What are you talking about?Call the ambulance!

1013
01:35:58,666 --> 01:36:00,517
阿香
Xiang!

1014
01:36:00,752 --> 01:36:02,602
请您止步
Please stop here.

1015
01:36:02,754 --> 01:36:04,396
走啊 往哪走啊

1016

警察 来就来
The police is here!- I don't care!

1017
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:10,110
大不了被抓走啊
They can arrest me here.

1018
01:36:13,306 --> 01:36:16,408
阿香 原来这么爱我
Xiang, now I know how much you love me.

1019
01:36:16,559 --> 01:36:18,577
肯为我挡枪
You are willing to take a bullet for me.

1020
01:36:18,728 --> 01:36:23,665
我怎么能辜负她呢 你想多了吧
How can I let her down?- You think too much.

1021
01:36:23,816 --> 01:36:29,755
等她好了 我要跟她生孩子 生很多很多孩子
When she gets well, I'll have kids with her. A lot of kids.

1022
01:36:29,906 --> 01:36:32,591
很多很多孩子
A lot of kids.

1023
01:36:45,004 --> 01:36:48,857
看我干什么
Why are you looking at me?

1024
01:36:49,008 --> 01:36:51,693
谢谢你救了我
Thanks for saving me.

1025
01:36:53,429 --> 01:36:55,363
别怪我拖累你就好啦 好好的假期
I hope you don't blame me for dragging you down.

1026
01:36:55,515 --> 01:36:59,910
怎么变成这个样子
Your vacation turns out like this.

1027
01:37:01,437 --> 01:37:04,748
你为什么来泰国
Why did you come to Thailand?

1028
01:37:04,899 --> 01:37:09,669
有哪个人 在国内混得舒坦 愿意出来呢
Anyone who has a good life at home won't go to another country.

1029
01:37:10,905 --> 01:37:15,425
留下有留下的原因 出来有出来的理由啦
We all have reasons to go abroad and stay.

1030
01:37:19,954 --> 01:37:20,947
误会了
It's not like that.

1031
01:37:21,147 --> 01:37:21,600
大哥
Eldest brother.

1032
01:37:22,047 --> 01:37:22,800
误会了
It's not like that.

1033
01:37:23,498 --> 01:37:26,601
很快整个镇子 都知道了这件丑事
In no time, the whole town knew about the scandal.

1034
01:37:27,836 --> 01:37:32,231
那时候 我才明白 你打算用什么料补呢
I finally realise that...- What would you like me to use?

1035
01:37:32,465 --> 01:37:36,110
这世上 比所有人瞧不起你还难受的滋味
Being pitied by everyone is more miserable than...

1036
01:37:36,261 --> 01:37:39,696
就是让所有人同情你
...being despised by them.

1037
01:37:40,473 --> 01:37:43,701
这么久了 你不想回去吗
It's been a long time.Don't you want to go home?

1038
01:37:43,852 --> 01:37:48,831
外面千好万好 都不如家好
There is no place like home.

1039
01:37:48,982 --> 01:37:51,542
可是回去又能干什么呢
But what can I do,even if I go back?

1040
01:37:51,693 --> 01:37:54,169
牛皮都已经吹出去了
I have been bragging aboutmy life here.

1041
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:58,340
人家都以为你在外面混得风生水起
They all think I have a successful career.

1042
01:37:58,491 --> 01:38:04,221
其实 牙掉了 咽肚里
But I have to bear my own cross.

1043
01:38:04,414 --> 01:38:07,808
苦只有自己知道
And nobody knows my bitterness.

1044
01:38:07,959 --> 01:38:15,274
那些在外面 漂着不回家的人 都有自己的难处
Anybody who stay away from home have their own problems.

1045
01:38:17,260 --> 01:38:20,612
你呢 这么聪明
What about you? You are so smart.

1046
01:38:20,764 --> 01:38:25,159
警校不要你 那可是他们很大的损失呀
It's the police college's loss for rejecting you.

1047
01:38:27,896 --> 01:38:32,041
秦风同学 你为什么要报考刑警学院
Qin Feng, why do you want to get into the Criminal Police College?

1048
01:38:34,235 --> 01:38:37,588
这个问题很难回答吗
Is it so hard to answer?

1049
01:38:37,739 --> 01:38:42,968
我 不想说假话 我们也不想听假话呀
I don't want to lie to you.- We don't want you to lie.

1050
01:38:43,953 --> 01:38:48,182
我想完成一次 完美的犯罪
I want to commit a perfect crime.

1051
01:38:48,416 --> 01:38:51,643
啊 你是这么说
What? You actually said that?

1052
01:38:52,629 --> 01:38:54,563
你还真是个怪胎
You are really a freak.

1053
01:38:54,714 --> 01:38:56,815
看了这么多书和电影
You read all the books and watch all the movies...

1054
01:38:56,966 --> 01:38:59,610
不为破案 为犯罪
...not to solve crimes,but to commit one?

1055
01:39:12,607 --> 01:39:16,543
和你那 一直在狱里的老爸有关系
Does it have something to do with your dad in prison?

1056
01:39:18,238 --> 01:39:22,132
下回告诉你 下回 哪个下回
I'll tell you next time.- Next time? When is that?

1057
01:39:25,286 --> 01:39:27,721
没有生命危险
She's out of danger.

1058
01:39:31,835 --> 01:39:34,603
没事啦
She is fine.

1059
01:39:37,465 --> 01:39:39,400
这下跑不掉啦
We can't run away this time.

1060
01:39:39,551 --> 01:39:42,653
案子不是推理得差不多了吗 要不我们投降吧
The case is almost solved.How about we surrender?

1061
01:39:42,804 --> 01:39:44,655
不行 还差一点儿
No, I need the last piece of the puzzle.

1062
01:39:44,806 --> 01:39:46,490
还跑 跑
We have to run again?- Yes.

1063
01:39:46,641 --> 01:39:50,077
这回真跑不了啦 外面那么多警察 怎么跑啊
With all the police out there,we really can't escape this time.

1064
01:39:50,228 --> 01:39:53,080
有了 找救兵
Got it! Let's get help.

1065
01:39:59,404 --> 01:40:02,798
哥 有消息了
Brother, any news?

1066
01:40:02,949 --> 01:40:06,719
托尼说人和货 都在医院
Tony says Tang Ren and the gold are all in the hospital.

1067
01:40:08,872 --> 01:40:13,642
哥 咱的苦日子到头了
Brother, our ordeal is coming to an end.

1068
01:40:17,088 --> 01:40:19,273
算他妈到头啦
Finally!

1069
01:41:02,092 --> 01:41:04,276
走啊 进 进
Come on! Hurry up!

1070
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:43,065
死不瞑目啊
You didn't die in peace.

1071
01:41:48,263 --> 01:41:50,656
安静
Quiet.

1072
01:41:56,396 --> 01:41:59,123
安静 安静 安静
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

1073
01:42:58,124 --> 01:43:01,143
站住
Stop!

1074
01:44:18,663 --> 01:44:25,978
是的 市长您放心 绝不会再有这样的事了
It will never happen again.Yes, Mayor.

1075
01:44:33,303 --> 01:44:36,363
你们听到了
You all heard that.

1076
01:44:36,514 --> 01:44:38,991
这次行动也不是完全没有收获啊
We have actually accomplished something in this operation.

1077
01:44:39,184 --> 01:44:42,911
盗窃团伙也被我们击毙了一个人 抓获了两个人啊
We shot a man dead and arrested two of the robbers.

1078
01:44:43,063 --> 01:44:47,624
所以 你们就炸毁了一个医院
So you blew off a hospital?

1079
01:44:47,776 --> 01:44:52,421
上次是警察局 这次是医院
After the police station,and now it's the hospital.

1080
01:44:52,572 --> 01:44:56,633
抓一个唐仁 你们是不是要毁掉整个曼谷
Do you have to blast the whole Bangkok to get Tang Ren?

1081
01:44:56,785 --> 01:44:59,928
不是不是 我不听你们废话了
No.- I don't want to hear that.

1082
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:03,474
不是 明天是最后期限
No.- Tomorrow is the deadline.

1083
01:45:03,625 --> 01:45:08,395
你们再抓不到唐仁 就一起滚到COWBOY摸屁股
If you can't get him by then,you can sell yourselves at Cowboy!

1084
01:45:08,546 --> 01:45:10,564
不是NANA吗 滚
I thought you said Nana.- Get out!

1085
01:45:10,715 --> 01:45:14,151
你知道谁是凶手啦 思诺养父 李
Do you know who the murderer is?- Snow's stepfather, Lee.

1086
01:45:14,302 --> 01:45:19,406
啊 怎么会是他呢 他在废车厂工作
How can it be him?- He works at the junk yard.

1087
01:45:19,557 --> 01:45:21,408
巧是巧 可你也不能说
It's a coincidence.But it doesn't mean...

1088
01:45:21,559 --> 01:45:23,494
他就是凶手啊
...he is the murderer.

1089
01:45:23,645 --> 01:45:27,164
四月十三号以前 他请了一周的假
He took a week's leave before April 13th.

1090
01:45:27,315 --> 01:45:30,292
不巧了吧 你怎么知道
Not so much a coincidence, huh?- How do you know that?

1091
01:45:30,443 --> 01:45:32,252
我问了废车厂的华裔经理
I asked the Chinese guy at the junk yard.

1092
01:45:32,404 --> 01:45:35,881
可是黄金呢 我们还剩下两天
But what about the gold?We have two days left.

1093
01:45:36,032 --> 01:45:38,217
我可不想不坐牢就去喂鳄鱼啊
I don't want to go to prison or be fed to the crocodiles.

1094
01:45:38,368 --> 01:45:40,469
这一切都是他精心策划好的
This is all elaborately planned by him.

1095
01:45:40,620 --> 01:45:43,138
我们找到凶手 就找到黄金了
We will find the gold when the murderer is found.

1096
01:45:43,289 --> 01:45:45,057
那我们现在去哪里啊
So where are we going now?

1097
01:45:45,208 --> 01:45:47,309
去找杀人动机
To find out the motive for murder.

1098
01:46:00,682 --> 01:46:02,449
思诺
Snow.

1099
01:46:02,934 --> 01:46:05,119
安眠药 自杀
Sleeping pills. Suicide.

1100
01:46:05,895 --> 01:46:07,663
干什么 人工呼吸啊
What are you doing?- Give her mouth-to-mouth.

1101
01:46:07,856 --> 01:46:10,165
呼个毛线啊 又不是溺水
Cut it out.It's not like she is drowned.

1102
01:46:10,316 --> 01:46:12,543
对 对 赶快送医院啦
Right, let's take her to hospital.

1103
01:46:21,745 --> 01:46:25,222
上面写的什么 杀人动机
What's in there?- The motive.

1104
01:46:25,373 --> 01:46:27,433
什么杀人动机
What motive?

1105
01:46:28,251 --> 01:46:30,811
到底写的什么
What's really in there?

1106
01:46:31,254 --> 01:46:32,771
怎么样
How is she?

1107
01:46:32,922 --> 01:46:37,484
已经给她洗胃了 没危险的
We have pumped her stomach.She is out of danger now.

1108
01:46:37,635 --> 01:46:39,778
没事啦
She is fine.

1109
01:46:43,975 --> 01:46:46,452
阴魂不散啊
They just won't leave us alone.

1110
01:46:55,904 --> 01:46:58,380
小唐 我知道了
Tang, I get it now.

1111
01:46:58,531 --> 01:47:00,257
知道什么了 先找辆车
What?- Let's find a car.

1112
01:47:00,408 --> 01:47:02,134
干什么 去颂帕工坊
What for?- Go to Sompat's Workshop.

1113
01:47:02,285 --> 01:47:04,011
现在 最后再赌一把
Now?- This is our last chance.

1114
01:47:04,162 --> 01:47:05,596
赌什么 黄金
For what?- To find the gold.

1115
01:47:12,545 --> 01:47:14,897
黄SIR 唐仁
Sir, it's Tang Ren.

1116
01:47:17,008 --> 01:47:19,568
在那呢 追 追 追 快 快
Over there.- Get him, go, go, go!

1117
01:47:27,102 --> 01:47:28,952
在前面堵住他们啊
Block them at the next intersection.

1118
01:47:50,542 --> 01:47:53,685
看那里啊 大皇宫啊
Look there! It's the Grand Palace.

1119
01:48:28,246 --> 01:48:31,181
没有我命令不准开枪
Don't shoot. I want him alive.

1120
01:48:39,507 --> 01:48:45,529
唐仁 放弃抵抗 赶紧投降
Tang Ren, give up resistance and surrender now.

1121
01:48:46,431 --> 01:48:49,032
怎么办 看你往哪跑
What do we do now?- You have nowhere to go now.

1122
01:48:50,518 --> 01:48:52,619
冲过去呀
Run them over!

1123
01:49:09,371 --> 01:49:11,346
快跑呀
Run!

1124
01:49:12,332 --> 01:49:14,183
抓活的 抓活的
Get him alive!

1125
01:49:16,169 --> 01:49:17,936
这里啦
Here!

1126
01:49:35,563 --> 01:49:37,498
上车追呀
Get in the car and go after them!

1127
01:49:41,403 --> 01:49:42,836
让一让 让一让
Excuse me! Excuse me!

1128
01:49:42,987 --> 01:49:44,922
这样我们到不了唐人街
We can't get to Chinatown this way.

1129
01:49:45,073 --> 01:49:47,091
快给闫先生打电话啦
Call Mr. Yan.

1130
01:49:56,793 --> 01:49:58,477
谢谢你们把托尼交给我
Thank you for giving Tony to me.

1131
01:49:58,628 --> 01:50:00,354
但你们还剩不到两天
But you only have less than two days.

1132
01:50:00,505 --> 01:50:02,398
不用两天 今天就可以把黄金给你
We don't need two days.We can get your gold back today.

1133
01:50:02,549 --> 01:50:04,775
但是 你要帮我们
But you have to help us!

1134
01:50:19,274 --> 01:50:20,874
快 快
Go, go!

1135
01:50:31,369 --> 01:50:33,262
走开 走开
Get out of the way!

1136
01:50:36,249 --> 01:50:38,058
绕过去 绕过去
Go around them!

1137
01:50:51,014 --> 01:50:53,198
天助我也啦
Help from heaven.

1138
01:51:23,338 --> 01:51:24,897
走 走 走
Let's go!

1139
01:51:41,356 --> 01:51:44,208
自寻死路 给我包围这里
Digging your own grave.Besiege here!

1140
01:51:51,950 --> 01:51:54,343
你到底在找什么 黄金啊
What are you looking for?- The gold.

1141
01:51:54,494 --> 01:51:56,678
不是被我运出去了吗 应该还在这
I moved it.- It should still be here.

1142
01:51:56,830 --> 01:51:58,847
一百公斤东西 不难找
It weighs over 100kg.Shouldn't be so hard to find it.

1143
01:51:58,999 --> 01:52:01,141
警察前面找了好多次啦 都没有找到啊
The police searched several times,but couldn't find anything.

1144
01:52:01,292 --> 01:52:02,810
快点找
Find it!

1145
01:52:02,961 --> 01:52:05,062
找不到呢 找不到就死定啦
What if we can't find it?- We will be dead meat.

1146
01:52:07,465 --> 01:52:09,566
大声公
The megaphone!

1147
01:52:11,386 --> 01:52:13,612
里面的人听着
The men in there,listen carefully.

1148
01:52:13,763 --> 01:52:16,949
不要再抵抗了 你们已经被包围了
Don't kick against the pricks.You are besieged.

1149
01:52:17,100 --> 01:52:21,704
唐仁 我的忍耐是有限度的 现在我数三个数
Tang Ren, I only have so much patience. I'll count to three.

1150
01:52:21,855 --> 01:52:24,081
如果你再不出来 我就要进去了
If you don't come out by then,we will go in.

1151
01:52:24,232 --> 01:52:26,291
我们就要进去啦
We will go in.

1152
01:52:27,444 --> 01:52:28,136
一
One.

1153
01:52:28,536 --> 01:52:29,036
一
One.

1154
01:52:29,487 --> 01:52:32,172
二
Two.

1155
01:52:34,159 --> 01:52:36,468
三
Three.

1156
01:52:56,931 --> 01:52:58,741
唐仁 你脑子是不是有问题
Tang Ren, what's wrong with you?

1157
01:52:58,892 --> 01:53:01,368
拿佛像来当人质呀
Are you holding the Buddha statue hostage?

1158
01:53:01,519 --> 01:53:05,456
黄兰登 你要的黄金在这里呀
Huang Landeng, the gold you are looking for is in here.

1159
01:53:05,732 --> 01:53:08,167
什么鬼啊
What the heck?

1160
01:53:14,824 --> 01:53:16,675
黄金一直在这里
The gold is in here the whole time.

1161
01:53:16,826 --> 01:53:19,261
根本就没有出去过
It never left the place.

1162
01:53:19,412 --> 01:53:22,473
只不过 颂帕把它给铸成佛型了
Sompat made it into a Buddha statue...

1163
01:53:22,624 --> 01:53:25,809
还没来得及告诉他同伙 就被杀死啦
...but he got killed before he could tell his partners.

1164
01:53:25,960 --> 01:53:28,062
五人 盗金团伙
The five suspects of the robbery gang...

1165
01:53:28,213 --> 01:53:30,898
分别是颂帕 还有你的助手托尼
...are Sompat,your assistant Tony...

1166
01:53:31,049 --> 01:53:33,192
昨晚在医院见得那三个人
...and the three guys at the hospital yesterday.

1167
01:53:33,343 --> 01:53:35,652
黄金失主 闫先生可以证明啊
The owner of the stolen gold,Mr. Yan, can prove that.

1168
01:53:37,055 --> 01:53:40,115
可是颂帕还是你杀的 不是我
But you are still the murderer.- No, I'm not.

1169
01:53:40,266 --> 01:53:43,285
凶手另有其人 我们已经找到他了
It's someone else.- We have found him.

1170
01:53:43,645 --> 01:53:47,122
可以马上带你去找他 当面指证
And we can take you to him now.- To testify against him.

1171
01:53:59,536 --> 01:54:02,721
黄兰登 我知道你是铁血神探
Huang Landeng,I know you are the Hot Fuzz.

1172
01:54:02,914 --> 01:54:07,101
难道你不想知道事情的真相吗 很刺激的
Don't you want to know the truth?- It's thrilling.

1173
01:54:07,252 --> 01:54:11,313
我再相信你一次 别跟我耍花样啊
I'll believe you one more time.Don't play tricks with me.

1174
01:54:18,722 --> 01:54:20,531
黄金案归你了 不是我
The gold robbery case is yours.- What?

1175
01:54:20,682 --> 01:54:23,033
凶杀案当然是我的啦 我
And the homicide case is mine.- I...

1176
01:54:23,184 --> 01:54:26,245
副局长当然也是我啦
And I will be the deputy chief, too.

1177
01:54:29,649 --> 01:54:32,126
喝喝这个补补脑
Here, it's brain-boosting.

1178
01:54:33,695 --> 01:54:38,424
你还有什么不明白的吗 一会儿 你和凶手对质
Do you have any questions?You confront the murderer.

1179
01:54:38,658 --> 01:54:41,510
为什么又是我 不是你呀
Why me again?

1180
01:54:41,661 --> 01:54:44,555
你 你说呢
What do you think?

1181
01:54:47,667 --> 01:54:49,435
你不该这么做的
You shouldn't have done this.

1182
01:54:49,586 --> 01:54:52,604
你好啊 雇主先生 你什么意思
Nice to meet you.- What are you talking about?

1183
01:54:56,176 --> 01:55:00,028
我们见过 就在颂帕死的那天晚上 你忘记啦
We met on the night Sompat was killed. Don't you remember that?

1184
01:55:00,722 --> 01:55:04,199
我不明白你在说什么
I don't know what you are talking about.

1185
01:55:05,018 --> 01:55:09,038
这话好像是 烂俗电影里大反派的回答
It sounds like a line of the villain in a lame film.

1186
01:55:09,314 --> 01:55:12,583
女士们 先生们 我想说的是
Ladies and gentlemen,I would like to point out that...

1187
01:55:12,901 --> 01:55:17,796
颂帕被杀案 和黄金失窃案 这本来就是两个案子
...the murder of Sompat and the robbery are two different cases.

1188
01:55:17,947 --> 01:55:22,092
只不过恰巧的是 颂帕也是黄金盗匪之一
But coincidentally,Sompat was one of the robbers.

1189
01:55:22,243 --> 01:55:27,014
所以这个案子 才给我和黄警探带来了这么多的麻烦
So it brought so much trouble to Detective Huang and me.

1190
01:55:27,165 --> 01:55:31,435
说重点 故事 要从死者死前一周
Get to the point!- The story began from April 7th...

1191
01:55:31,586 --> 01:55:34,605
也就是说四月七日那天开始讲起
...which is seven days before the murder.

1192
01:55:35,256 --> 01:55:39,359
那天 我接到了一个陌生人的电话
On that day, I got a phone call from a stranger.

1193
01:55:39,511 --> 01:55:41,195
你好
Hello.

1194
01:55:41,346 --> 01:55:45,741
现在我知道了 打电话的人就是这位李先生
Now I know that the caller is Mr. Lee here.

1195
01:55:45,892 --> 01:55:50,245
这是他 计划的一小部分 先找一个合适的替死鬼
It's a part of his plan.Find a fall guy first.

1196
01:55:50,397 --> 01:55:52,956
我按约定到了颂帕工坊
I went to Sompat's Workshop as asked.

1197
01:55:53,108 --> 01:55:55,626
我以为见到的是死者颂帕
I thought the guy I met was Sompat.

1198
01:55:55,777 --> 01:55:59,963
而我见到的 却是这位李先生
But the man I really saw was Mr. Lee.

1199
01:56:00,115 --> 01:56:02,716
不可能 他怎么进入现场的
It's impossible.How did he get into the workshop?

1200
01:56:02,867 --> 01:56:04,885
监视器根本没有拍到他
He didn't even show up in the footages.

1201
01:56:05,036 --> 01:56:07,721
我们这位李先生 知道监视器内容
Mr. Lee knew that the video footages...

1202
01:56:07,872 --> 01:56:09,932
七天就会自动覆盖
...would be automatically overwritten every seven days.

1203
01:56:10,083 --> 01:56:14,311
所以他提前一周 就藏在了颂帕的家里
So he hid in Sompat's workshop a week in advance.

1204
01:56:16,798 --> 01:56:21,110
他在床下留下的脚印 暴露了他的踪迹
The footprint he had left under the bed gave him away.

1205
01:56:21,261 --> 01:56:25,155
四月十四日晚 我们的李先生算好了时间
On the night of April 14th,with careful timing...

1206
01:56:25,306 --> 01:56:30,035
在我要来之前 他用降魔杵杀死了颂帕
...Mr. Lee killed Sompat with the vajra before I showed up.

1207
01:56:30,186 --> 01:56:32,454
李先生那晚并没有开灯
Mr. Lee didn't turn on the light that night.

1208
01:56:32,647 --> 01:56:36,041
而点的却是蜡烛 这样便于迷惑我
He lit a candle instead because it could not only dazzle me...

1209
01:56:36,192 --> 01:56:38,252
更能让蜡烛自己燃尽
...but also burn out itself.

1210
01:56:38,570 --> 01:56:43,590
而他 早就换上了和颂帕一样的服装 头套 眼镜
And he dressed like Sompat,and put on wig and glasses...

1211
01:56:43,742 --> 01:56:47,553
就是为了让我以为 他就是颂帕
...to make me believe that he was Sompat.

1212
01:56:47,704 --> 01:56:50,597
很快 我就如约而至了
Soon, I arrived in time.

1213
01:56:50,749 --> 01:56:52,975
取货
I'm here for a pick up.

1214
01:56:54,502 --> 01:56:56,895
最最精彩的就要来了
Now is the highlight of the story.

1215
01:56:57,047 --> 01:56:59,690
我们一直百思不得其解
What we couldn't figure out was...

1216
01:56:59,841 --> 01:57:01,775
凶手是如何离开现场的呢
...how the killer left the crime scene.

1217
01:57:01,926 --> 01:57:04,945
就在刚刚 我撞翻了医院的手推车
Just a while ago, when I knocked over a trolley in the hospital...

1218
01:57:05,096 --> 01:57:07,072
我才想到了答案
...I figured it out.

1219
01:57:07,223 --> 01:57:09,867
这招简直就是太完美了
This is so perfect.

1220
01:57:10,018 --> 01:57:14,955
他要让我送的货 根本就是他自己
What he asked me to pick up was himself.

1221
01:57:15,106 --> 01:57:19,126
他钻进木箱后 打开了工作室的音响
He got into the box and turned on the speaker in the studio...

1222
01:57:19,277 --> 01:57:22,504
让我误以为 继续工作的是颂帕
...to make me believe that the working man was Sompat.

1223
01:57:22,655 --> 01:57:26,592
其实 我看到的不过是具尸体
But in fact,what I saw was a dead body.

1224
01:57:26,743 --> 01:57:29,303
他从里面锁住了箱子
He locked the box from inside.

1225
01:57:29,454 --> 01:57:31,638
我以为我运出去的是佛像
I thought I left with a Buddha statue.

1226
01:57:31,790 --> 01:57:34,558
你们以为我运出去的是黄金
And you thought I left with the gold.

1227
01:57:34,709 --> 01:57:40,981
谁都没想到 我运出去的却是他 杀人凶手
But no one ever thought that I left with him, the murderer.

1228
01:57:47,222 --> 01:57:49,990
杰克・福翠尔《遗失的镭》中
In Jacques Futrelle's "The Problem of the Lost Radium"...

1229
01:57:50,141 --> 01:57:53,410
凶手就是藏在皮箱里潜入研究所的
...the murderer snuck into the lab lying in a suitcase.

1230
01:57:53,561 --> 01:57:56,288
青崎有吾 写的《体育馆杀人》
In Yugo Aosaki's "Murder in the Gym"...

1231
01:57:56,481 --> 01:58:00,626
凶手也是躲在 一辆手推车里离开现场的
...the murderer left the scene in a trolley.

1232
01:58:00,777 --> 01:58:05,506
这种桥段 在我们侦探推理界里 并不新鲜
It's not something new in our detective world.

1233
01:58:07,909 --> 01:58:11,887
而我们这位凶手 利用监控录像
The murderer took advantage of the surveillance footages...

1234
01:58:12,038 --> 01:58:15,557
把我包装成了嫌疑犯
...to set me up,and took advantage of me...

1235
01:58:15,709 --> 01:58:17,518
利用嫌疑犯把真凶带出了现场
...to bring the real murderer out.

1236
01:58:17,669 --> 01:58:21,146
我不得不说 干得实在是太漂亮了
I have to say,he did such a good job.

1237
01:58:21,339 --> 01:58:26,485
要不是他 千算万算只算错了一步 替死鬼找到了
If he didn't miss a step and took the Number One detective...

1238
01:58:26,636 --> 01:58:30,155
唐人街第一神探 我的身上
...of Chinatown as his fall guy...

1239
01:58:30,306 --> 01:58:34,493
这个案子 简直就是 天衣无缝
...the crime he committed would have been perfect.

1240
01:58:34,644 --> 01:58:37,538
听着是精彩 但李先生的杀人动机在哪呢
It sounds interesting.But what's his motive?

1241
01:58:39,149 --> 01:58:44,169
你一定知道 颂帕的儿子 丹 一年前离奇失踪了
You must know that Sompat's son,Dan went missing a year ago.

1242
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:48,215
知道啊 可是丹就是这位
Yes.- But what you don't know is...

1243
01:58:48,366 --> 01:58:51,510
思诺小姑娘的同学 你一定就不知道了
...that Dan is Snow's schoolmate.

1244
01:58:51,661 --> 01:58:57,975

It led us to another sad story.

1245
01:59:02,797 --> 01:59:08,819

You must have read this journal.- Whose journal is it?

1246
01:59:10,096 --> 01:59:12,698

Hers. She tried to burn it...

1247
01:59:12,849 --> 01:59:15,617

...before she attempted suicide,but we stopped her in time.

1248
01:59:15,810 --> 01:59:20,330

What's in the journal?- The motive for murder.

1249
01:59:21,399 --> 01:59:24,543

Snow's journal keeps track of...

1250
01:59:24,819 --> 01:59:27,963

...Sompat's psychological changes after his son had gone missing.

1251
01:59:28,114 --> 01:59:31,341

He started to stalk his son's schoolmates.

1252
01:59:31,493 --> 01:59:34,428

It's so creepy.- What's creepier is that...

1253
01:59:34,579 --> 01:59:38,223

...he brought Snow home and raped her.

1254
01:59:40,502 --> 01:59:42,853

Shut up!

1255
01:59:43,171 --> 01:59:45,481

The girl felt ashamed to tell anybody...

1256
01:59:45,632 --> 01:59:48,817

...so she kept the painful experience in her journal.

1257
01:59:48,968 --> 01:59:54,156

But unfortunately, her stepfather read the journal one day.

1258
01:59:54,307 --> 01:59:57,534

Even if what's in the journal is true...

1259
01:59:57,686 --> 02:00:00,454

...you can't testify against me.

1260
02:00:00,605 --> 02:00:05,417

I have never gone to that workshop or met Sompat.

1261
02:00:06,319 --> 02:00:09,380

That van comes from the junk yard.

1262
02:00:09,531 --> 02:00:13,592

And you work there, don't you?- It's just a coincidence.

1263
02:00:13,743 --> 02:00:15,886

Where is the evidence?

1264
02:00:16,037 --> 02:00:18,347

We fought against the real murderer last night.

1265
02:00:18,498 --> 02:00:22,476

If I've got it right,your right arm is injured.

1266
02:00:24,087 --> 02:00:30,567

Even if I am, it's from an accident at work a few days ago.

1267
02:00:33,304 --> 02:00:35,364

Look at you. Your eyebrows are pointy at the front...

1268
02:00:35,515 --> 02:00:37,574

...and wide at rear. You have a black mole at your Life Palace.

1269
02:00:37,726 --> 02:00:39,618

You have bloodshot eyes and crow's feet.

1270
02:00:39,769 --> 02:00:42,246

Someone having a face like that is either violent or wicked.

1271
02:00:42,397 --> 02:00:46,458

You want evidence, don't you?

1272
02:00:48,570 --> 02:00:51,964

The Bluetooth-enabled speaker can remember the users.

1273
02:00:52,115 --> 02:00:56,093

Turn on your phone and see if it connects automatically.

1274
02:00:58,663 --> 02:01:02,850

Dad, is this true?

1275
02:01:05,170 --> 02:01:08,230

I don't regret this.

1276
02:01:09,924 --> 02:01:11,859

I love you.

1277
02:01:15,055 --> 02:01:22,202

I know.- No, you don't know. I love you.

1278
02:01:50,507 --> 02:01:54,276

He has retrieved the stolen gold...

1279
02:01:54,427 --> 02:01:58,781

...and killed the murderer who tried to escape.

1280
02:01:58,932 --> 02:02:06,080

Let's welcome our new deputy chief of Chinatown Police, Kon Tai.

1281
02:02:30,380 --> 02:02:32,189

I hope you will come to Thailand again.

1282
02:02:32,340 --> 02:02:35,234

Thank you.- You must come for our wedding.

1283
02:02:35,385 --> 02:02:37,653

Who says I will marry you,pauper?

1284
02:02:37,804 --> 02:02:40,155

I have to call you aunt now?- Of course.

1285
02:02:41,474 --> 02:02:45,369

Aunt? Isn't he your cousin?Aren't you born in the 90s?

1286
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:48,163

Goodbye!- Liars!

1287
02:02:55,572 --> 02:02:58,298

What? You don't want to leave?

1288
02:02:58,450 --> 02:03:01,468

What will you miss more,Thailand or the Thai people?

1289
02:03:01,619 --> 02:03:05,347

What are you talking about?- You don't want to leave me.

1290
02:03:08,626 --> 02:03:10,811

Stop, stop!

1291
02:03:12,088 --> 02:03:15,482

What is written on that signboard?

1292
02:03:15,633 --> 02:03:17,776

It's the name of that bar.

1293
02:03:17,927 --> 02:03:21,321

It's the most famous gay bar in Bangkok.

1294
02:03:21,806 --> 02:03:24,825

Sompat got divorced with his wife nine years ago.

1295
02:03:24,976 --> 02:03:26,785

The room is neither messy nor smelly.

1296
02:03:26,936 --> 02:03:29,121

He must be a sissy or a gay.

1297
02:03:41,993 --> 02:03:45,137

I thought you were going home today.

1298
02:03:45,705 --> 02:03:48,390

I want to tell you a story.

1299
02:03:48,541 --> 02:03:51,477

Both you and that uncle love stories.

1300
02:03:53,380 --> 02:03:58,108

A boy went missing. His father had been looking for him.

1301
02:03:59,594 --> 02:04:01,987

He suspected that his son was dead.

1302
02:04:02,138 --> 02:04:06,950

More importantly, he suspected the murderer of his son...

1303
02:04:07,102 --> 02:04:10,079

...might be a girl.

1304
02:04:24,202 --> 02:04:26,637

The girl found out about it.

1305
02:04:26,788 --> 02:04:29,431

She was afraid that she'd be exposed.

1306
02:04:29,582 --> 02:04:33,185

So she decided to get rid of the father.

1307
02:04:33,336 --> 02:04:35,979

She knew about the perverted love her stepfather had for her.

1308
02:04:36,131 --> 02:04:40,401

So she fabricated a journal...

1309
02:04:42,387 --> 02:04:45,280

...and let her stepfather read it intentionally.

1310
02:04:49,602 --> 02:04:53,956

I wondered what was in the part that was ripped off.

1311
02:04:54,107 --> 02:04:56,917

What was it that she didn't want us to know?

1312
02:04:57,068 --> 02:04:59,336

Maybe it was the way the murder was committed.

1313
02:05:02,699 --> 02:05:08,762

If I could kill him,I'd find a scrapped van...

1314
02:05:08,913 --> 02:05:12,391

...and a fall guy first.

1315
02:05:12,542 --> 02:05:14,518

I'd get into his house...

1316
02:05:14,669 --> 02:05:17,146

...before the footages are automatically overwritten.

1317
02:05:21,134 --> 02:05:24,695

I'd make him suffer thousands of times worse than I did.

1318
02:05:33,897 --> 02:05:36,665

The girl didn't expect that we'd come to her.

1319
02:05:36,816 --> 02:05:41,211

So she changed her plan and used us...

1320
02:05:41,363 --> 02:05:43,714

...to get rid of her perverted stepfather.

1321
02:05:48,244 --> 02:05:51,805

The timing the journal showed up and its burning speed...

1322
02:05:51,956 --> 02:05:54,058

...were exactly on spot.

1323
02:05:54,209 --> 02:05:57,811

But the girl didn't know that...

1324
02:05:57,962 --> 02:06:01,607

...the man she framed a rape against is a gay.

1325
02:06:01,800 --> 02:06:03,650

You don't stutter now.

1326
02:06:03,802 --> 02:06:07,362

Of course,these are all hypothesized.

1327
02:06:07,514 --> 02:06:10,491

No evidence can prove the sexual orientation of a dead man.

1328
02:06:10,642 --> 02:06:14,244

But I don't get it.- Forget it.

1329
02:06:15,063 --> 02:06:18,832

This book says,while we are individual lives...

1330
02:06:18,983 --> 02:06:21,627

...the summation of good and evil is invariant.

1331
02:06:21,778 --> 02:06:25,714

Everyone plays his role from birth.

1332
02:06:25,865 --> 02:06:29,510

Some of them are good,and some of them are evil.

1333
02:06:29,786 --> 02:06:32,221

What are you?

1334
02:06:36,918 --> 02:06:40,020

Should the villain smile like this?

1335
02:07:07,490 --> 02:07:09,800

So this is it?

1336
02:07:09,951 --> 02:07:15,264

There's nothing else I can do.- Nobody cares about the truth.

1337
02:07:15,415 --> 02:07:19,852

They only believe the truth they want to see.

1338
02:07:22,380 --> 02:07:26,233

Good and evil are incompatible.

1339
02:07:26,384 --> 02:07:31,155

When there is evil,there has to be good.

1340
02:07:31,306 --> 02:07:33,323

Yes. There are so many mysteries.

1341
02:07:33,475 --> 02:07:36,285

As detectives of Chinatown,we have to uphold justice...

1342
02:07:36,436 --> 02:07:38,954

So I have to endorse the ticket.

1346
02:07:55,413 --> 02:07:58,140

Or you can stay for another seven days.

1347
02:07:58,291 --> 02:08:01,518

I'll take you to the Grand Palace tomorrow.
