6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,400
All right.

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,660
Are you ready for one more?

8
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,610
You with the band?

9
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,610
Yeah. Record label.

10
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,740
- You better put that on. - Yes, sir.

11
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,540
Whoa.

12
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,760
Guys, cleanup on aisle seven. What's up, man?

13
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,900
Hi, Leo. Keep playing that thing, you're gonna go blind.

14
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,320
Matt, where are we on that sit-down with Elijah?

15
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,320
- I told you, talk to Zeke. - Zeke said talk to you.

16
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,740
They want the cover.

17
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,240
Jeff won't commit until he sees the article.

18
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,660
But it's a definite possibility.

19
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,740
Gotta go, Leo.

20
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,160
Come on, Matt. Is he gonna do it or not?

21
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,250
It's a "definite possibility."

22
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,300
We love you, New York!

23
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,010
- What's up, man? - Good to see you too!

24
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,930
What's up?

25
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,060
What's up, man?

26
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,340
Elijah. Got a visitor.

27
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,930
- Hey. - Hey.

28
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,850
- Great set, man. - Thank you.

29
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,060
Yeah.

30
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,600
- Did you talk to him? - Not yet.

31
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,520
- Would you talk to him? - Talk to me about what?

32
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,280
Talk to me about what?

33
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,490
Elijah just signed with Interscope.

34
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,780
What?

35
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,160
Are you fucking joking? What's going on?

36
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,460
You're just slow, man.

37
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,460
"I'm slow"? What do you mean, "I'm slow"?

38
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,340
- He doesn't mean "slow." - He said, "slow." Shut up, okay?

39
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,210
- What do you mean? - I haven't had a record out in a year.

40
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,340
So? You're gettin' ready to cut an album. We just booked a studio.

41
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,890
Look, Interscope's got two songs ready to go.

42
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,260
And they're fuckin' good.

43
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,350
But they're not yours. I thought you want to do your own stuff.

44
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,770
We've been telling you for a while now that we need a new single, okay?

45
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,230
Jesus. Elijah, come on, man.

46
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,900
I got nothing but love for you, man. Really.

47
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,320
It's not personal.

48
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,330
Yeah.

49
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,180
Good morning, Eve.

50
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,680
- Morning, Matt. - Hi.

51
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,100
- Does she know about... - Everyone knows.

52
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,190
Can you pull me Elijah's sheet when you get a chance?

53
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,450
- Thanks. - Matt Ryder's office. This is Kim.

54
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,240
I'm sorry. Mr. Ryder is in a meeting. Can you return?

55
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,530
- Thank you. - Shit. His numbers were holding.

56
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,200
- Rob Marker's office. This is Kim. - Rob Marker's office?

57
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,540
I'm sorry. I don't have him right now. Can you return? Great.

58
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,460
- What the hell was that? - Marker's been promoted.

59
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,130
Really?

60
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:45,050
And Mr. Lepselter actually wants to see you right now.

61
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,930
Sit down.

62
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,720
Am I about to get fired?

63
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,430
Sit down.

64
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,770
Come on. I've been working for you since before you could make payroll.

65
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,610
 Ten years.

66
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,780
I've kept you on at a loss for the last few.

67
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,990
A loss? Really? Okay.

68
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,660
I brought you a Coldplay demo in '99. You didn't even listen to it.

69
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,240
Arcade Fire in 2003. A bootleg and you were like,

70
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,960
"Great in concert. Won't translate to the airwaves."

71
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,830
Three years ago, I had the Spare Sevens here, in the room. In the fucking room.

72
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,750
I blew a few good calls for you. So? You been cashin' that chit in for years.

73
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,510
Come on. I know music better than anybody in this fuckin' office.

74
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:31,010
Yeah. You've got a great ear. That made you irreplaceable in 1998.

75
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,840
- That's bullshit. It still matters. - Music is a commodity.

76
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,610
And it's airborne. You can't protect it.

77
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,390
 You can't sell what you can't protect.

78
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,400
The only thing you can sell, Mick, is the artist. You haven't been signing any.

79
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,770
Last night, you let your meal ticket walk out that door.

80
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,110
Yeah.

81
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,030
Yeah, well...

82
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,570
I'm still working 'em.

83
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,280
- Working who? - Spare Sevens.

84
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,410
- Spare Sevens? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

85
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,410
Right.

86
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:00,620
Hey, I'm not jokin'. No, no, no. They're not happy at Sony.

87
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,000
The label rushed the last album. They're pissed.

88
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,130
The Spare Sevens are about to pop globally.

89
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,760
Sony will make them happy.

90
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,550
No. These guys aren't like Elijah.

91
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,760
They actually take the time to make music the way real bands used to make it.

92
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,140
I talked to their manager, Dan, at PMO.

93
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,640
- You have a sit-down? - I will.

94
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,900
I'll give you two weeks.

95
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,650
Not because I owe it to you, but because I want the Spare Sevens.

96
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,290
Hello.

97
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,760
You have no pictures.

98
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,840
Like, on your walls and your desk. You don't have any photos.

99
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,720
Who doesn't hang up a picture?

100
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,970
Good question. Here's another: Who are you?

101
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:03,020
Most people in the office have photos of their wife, girlfriend, dog. Something.

102
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,570
Well, my wife left me, don't have a girlfriend, and I'm afraid of dogs.

103
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,480
I'm sorry to disappoint. Excuse me.

104
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,490
Yes?

105
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,740
Hi. There is a strange woman standing in my office.

106
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,950
- On my way. - I am not strange.

107
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,200
- You're a little strange. - I work for Ben.

108
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,870
Oh, oh, you work for Ben. Okay, that's great.

109
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,500
- I don't know who that is. - Benjamin Asher Ryder.

110
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,040
Your father.

111
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,090
Sorry, I'm Zooey Kern.

112
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:35,140
I'm Ben's nurse/personal assistant.

113
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,390
Listen, Miss Kern. This has already been a monumentally shitty day,

114
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,810
and I haven't started dealing with the West Coast.

115
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,390
Hey, Kim!

116
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,270
Not sure what you're doing here. Honestly, I don't care.

117
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,060
Ben's dying.

118
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,950
Right. See, I thought I covered that with "I don't care."

119
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,950
- He has liver cancer. - Uh-huh.

120
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,620
And he's got three months left, maybe four.

121
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,590
Sorry, Matt. I was in with Marker. Miss, do you have an appointment?

122
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,420
- Wouldn't you know if she did? - It was rhetorical.

123
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,050
I need you to show this woman out. Okay?

124
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,300
Then get ahold of Dan Summers at PMO Talent.

125
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,470
I want to talk to him about the Spare Sevens.

126
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,510
Actually, just say that it's urgent.

127
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,770
- Rob Marker's office. - Are you kidding me?

128
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,360
I'll just call security myself.

129
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,360
I don't think you actually have security.

130
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,740
No. No, we don't.

131
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,820
Are you familiar with Kodachrome?

132
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,030
Yes. Paul Simon, 1973. What do you want to know?

133
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,620
Not that. Kodachrome film.

134
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,460
Your father shoots on Kodachrome. He prefers his pictures to be projected...

135
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,960
...with light rather than printed. I know his spiel.

136
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,710
There's only one place left in the world that processes Kodachrome,

137
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,010
and that's Dwayne's Photo in Parsons, Kansas.

138
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,340
But Kodak decided to stop manufacturing the dyes,

139
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,760
so after next week, it'll be impossible to develop Kodachrome film.

140
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,640
- Amazing. - Your father found four rolls

141
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,060
he shot a really long time ago,

142
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,270
and he never got them developed, and it woke something up in him.

143
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,980
He's decided he's gonna have one last show.

144
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,650
How about that? Good for him, okay?

145
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:13,190
This has been very, very... annoying.

146
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,570
- Let me show you out. - Can I just...

147
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,740
Ben needs to get these rolls to Kansas, and he can't fly in his condition.

148
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,330
If only there was a service that delivered overnight.

149
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,080
- Yeah, well, he doesn't trust FedEx. - Of course not.

150
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:29,540
You're his nurse/assistant/whatever. Don't you have a driver's license?

151
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,380
- Yeah, I do. - There you go.

152
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,630
But Ben wants you to drive him.

153
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:41,010
I'm gonna try to explain this as clearly as possible for you.

154
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,100
I've not spoken to the man in over a decade.

155
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,150
There's no way in hell I'm going to Kansas with him. Or anywhere.

156
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,760
You got it?

157
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,230
Come to dinner tonight.

158
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,150
I know I'm talking. I can hear my voice.

159
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,360
Matt!

160
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,690
He's dying.

161
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,780
You should go see him one last time.

162
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,540
There'll be a car waiting for you downstairs.

163
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,330
Hey, Matt. Larry Holdt, Ben's manager.

164
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,950
Yeah, I remember you.

165
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,660
The last time I saw you, you were still a teenager.

166
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,420
That's great.

167
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,170
Well, maybe we should get inside.

168
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,820
He's in there.

169
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,400
I didn't think you'd come.

170
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,160
Those look familiar.

171
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,200
Well, they should. They're yours.

172
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,790
You wanna bang it around a little?

173
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,170
- No, I don't play anymore. - That's too bad.

174
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,630
'Cause you used to be pretty good.

175
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,480
Oh, sorry for the smell.

176
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,280
You know, the meds they give me give me gas.

177
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,690
So, Matt...

178
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:22,270
Larry tells me things haven't been going so well for you at the record label.

179
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:28,150
I was telling Ben that record labels can't find a sustainable business model.

180
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,450
You told me that he was gonna be out on his ass any day now.

181
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,660
Jesus, Ben.

182
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,240
- Where'd you hear that? - Larry knows everything.

183
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,080
- Behave. - I'm dyin'. I don't have time to behave.

184
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,790
Come on. That's bullshit. You were a prick long before cancer.

185
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,090
That's true enough.

186
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,800
At least you two are talking.

187
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,130
This is good.

188
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,470
So how much time you got left?

189
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,100
Depends on which doctor you talk to.

190
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,440
I'm betting tits up by New Year's.

191
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:08,610
Why did you get divorced? She catch you in flagrante with some other babe?

192
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,200
- You'd like that, wouldn't you? - You catch her?

193
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,240
Because you fucked around on Mom doesn't mean everyone does.

194
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,620
oesn't anyone wanna pace yourselves?

195
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,080
Your mother and I had a complicated relationship.

196
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,000
Complicated by you putting your dick in every woman you met.

197
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,840
Your mother forgave me.

198
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,420
- Yeah. Well, she died alone, Ben. - So will I.

199
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,510
- Yeah, but you deserve to. - Hey.

200
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,720
It's okay. We're just... just catching up here.

201
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,980
- People change. - No, they don't.

202
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,350
Why don't we talk about the trip?

203
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,400
I can save us all a lot of trouble here. I'm not going on any trip.

204
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,700
You are a desperate old man.

205
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:57,160
Tryin' to what? Manufacture some bullshit redemption?

206
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,580
Why?

207
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:05,170
So you can pretend your empty, selfish life was anything but meaningless?

208
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,340
Thanks, but no thanks.

209
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,970
Just so you know, when you are dead, no one's gonna care that you're gone.

210
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,350
I mean, maybe these two, but you pay for them.

211
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,670
- Hello? - Matt, Larry Holdt.

212
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,220
- Hey, Larry. - I want to discuss...

213
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,440
Come on, man.

214
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,730
Matt, don't hang up.

215
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,770
- Not gonna change my mind, Larry. - I know.

216
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,940
- I'm gonna change it for you. - Oh, you are? Really? How?

217
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,700
Spare Sevens. I can get you a sit-down.

218
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,990
- Go on. - Their manager used to work for me.

219
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,370
He says you've been calling all day.

220
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,540
They're going to be playing in Chicago in a few days. Some radio station thing.

221
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,550
You can swing by on your way.

222
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,170
Wait. Hold on. What do you mean on my way?

223
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,550
You're talking about Kansas, yeah?

224
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,300
Look. I don't know how to make this any more clear.

225
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,300
That's just not going to happen.

226
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:43,470
Look. Ben needs the show, and you need that meeting

227
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:47,270
And trust me. This is the only way you'll get it.

228
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,360
I'm not going to go with him, Larry.

229
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,240
It's not happening.

230
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,490
Please, don't call back.

231
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,680
Fuck.

232
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,950
Good morning, Matthew. Glad you reconsidered.

233
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,040
So what's up with the Sevens?

234
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,410
Show's Saturday.

235
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,790
I'll make arrangements for a meeting afterwards.

236
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,380
Still drive that, huh? You fix the roof yet?

237
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,720
I'm sorry. Would you like to take your car?

238
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,010
- I don't have a car. - Then that settles that.

239
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,010
The car runs fine, Matt.

240
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:07,560
- You're going too, huh? - Unless you want to give me my shots.

241
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,560
- Is that okay with you? - Fine with me.

242
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,780
- All right. - Let's go! We're burning daylight.

243
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:20,990
In two miles, merge onto I-80 West.

244
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,780
Do not text and drive, please.

245
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,700
I'm not texting. I'm looking at texts. There's a difference.

246
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:30,210
Hey, this car doesn't have an iPhone jack or anything like that, does it?

247
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:34,420
We're strictly analog here. Some cassettes in the glove compartment.

248
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:39,800
In 1.5 miles, stay to the right to merge onto I-80 West.

249
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,340
Zooey, hand me that thing for a second, will you?

250
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,220
Yeah.

251
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:52,060
- What the hell are you doing? - Like I said, strictly analog.

252
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,440
We gotta drive halfway across the country.

253
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,860
That's right. I'm not gonna have some robot bitch whinin' in my ear,

254
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,530
sending me on some sterile interstate.

255
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,570
We have a week to get to Kansas. We're taking the scenic route.

256
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,200
We're going to use this map here.

257
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,830
- Remember what a map is? - Yeah. I know what a map is.

258
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,790
- Turn that up, will you, Zo? - Yeah.

259
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,380
Love this song.

260
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,390
- What are you doing? - Nothing.

261
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,330
Ben, you're here.

262
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:08,300
There's a diner across the street. We should meet up later and grab dinner.

263
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,430
That sounds like a plan.

264
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,640
Yeah, you guys go ahead.

265
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,770
I'm just gonna get in a quick workout, make it an early night.

266
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,370
Hey.

267
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,790
Don't give me that look.

268
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:35,660
Okay. You know what? You need to let your guard down.

269
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,170
- Excuse me? - Yeah. I know you're scared.

270
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,130
Scared? What am I scared of exactly?

271
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,220
You're scared to open yourself up to him.

272
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,800
You're scared to let yourself love him again.

273
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,680
- Wow. - Don't.

274
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,220
- Wow, that's amazing. - Yeah. Mm-hmm.

275
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:55,890
Yeah, I mean forget therapy or the facts of my relationship with him,

276
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,270
you spend six hours in a car with me, and you've cracked the code.

277
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,150
- You don't have to be a dick. - No, I don't need to be a dick.

278
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:05,070
I need to be... less scared to let him in.

279
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:06,990
Or let him into...

280
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,870
- I'm just saying... - I'll mull it over.

281
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,620
You made the effort to come.

282
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,950
You may as well try and get to know him a little bit.

283
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,330
Watch your fingers.

284
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,380
Ahh!

285
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,050
It was 1998 or so,

286
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:53,510
and I was in the White House doing a spread on Clinton at Bill's request.

287
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,420
It was right after the whole,

288
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,510
you know, bullshit impeachment circus.

289
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,890
Bill was trying to prove...

290
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,060
You're calling the Lewinsky scandal bullshit? 'Cause he...

291
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,480
He cheated on his wife

292
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,190
and lied to the entire country about it.

293
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,840
They all cheat. They all fuck around.

294
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,400
You should know that.

295
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,150
- Ben. - What? After the way your marriage ended?

296
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,320
- You're seriously gonna sit here and... - Stop.

297
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,160
What? Just because Matt's here. Don't be an idiot.

298
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,520
If anybody knows about fuckin' around...

299
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,500
Hey, you need to stop talking now.

300
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,670
- Leave her alone, okay? - It's fine.

301
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,090
I do believe Matt here's defending you.

302
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,440
Just go back to your bullshit stories

303
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,300
about you and your fancy friends.

304
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,800
What we're seeing now is jealousy.

305
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,640
Envy and resentment of a man

306
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,720
living in the shadow of his father's accomplishments.

307
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,810
Yeah, you've had a great big life.

308
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,480
- Yeah. You're damn straight I did. - Mm-hmm.

309
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,230
Where are all those friends while you're dying?

310
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,190
- Matt. - Alone?

311
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,320
Stop.

312
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,000
My work will live on long after I'm gone.

313
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,160
What have you done?

314
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,440
Holy shit. Look at that, man.

315
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,880
She's gotta be 250 pounds or something.

316
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,790
That outfit's beautiful.

317
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,380
Can you just try and take it easy on him?

318
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:17,050
Me? Are you kidding me? I was defending you.

319
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,200
You know, a month from now, two months,

320
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,810
he's going to be gone forever.

321
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,560
No, I get it, okay? I understand the concept.

322
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,860
It doesn't give him a free pass to be an asshole to people.

323
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,570
'Kay.

324
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,070
I'm going to go back to the motel.

325
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,540
Boy.

326
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,460
- Fucking... - Here's your check, hon.

327
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,710
Yeah. Thanks.

328
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:07,290
What? What's funny?

329
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,320
When I was a kid,

330
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,960
my mom used to take me up to the Poconos

331
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,130
for a few weeks every summer.

332
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,610
After we'd pass a few of those deer

333
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:22,390
 crossing signs that just went by,

334
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,100
I remember I asked her,

335
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:29,440
"Mom, how do the deers know

336
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,980
that's where they're supposed to cross?"

337
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,400
I was being serious. I was a kid.

338
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,780
But she just laughed her ass off

339
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,950
like it was the funniest thing she ever heard.

340
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,280
That felt great, 'cause...

341
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,240
I don't remember her laughing much.

342
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,330
When did she die?

343
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,670
I...

344
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,510
When I was 13.

345
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:04,720
I'm so sorry.

346
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,120
After that I moved out of New York

347
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,690
to live with my aunt and uncle in Cleveland.

348
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:18,530
Ben was... He was working in Africa at the time.

349
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:23,200
He didn't even make it back for the funeral.

350
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,570
There was a civil war going on.

351
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,910
Mm-hmm.

352
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:29,490
I'm not making excuses. I'm just...

353
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,660
saying if you think you had it rough,

354
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,790
just spend some time and effort.

355
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,750
I'll remember that.

356
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,220
We should go see him.

357
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:43,880
Go see who?

358
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:47,760
Your Uncle Dean. Cleveland's only an hour away,

359
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:51,350
and your "Spare Sister's" thing isn't until tomorrow night.

360
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,350
I wouldn't mind seeing my brother...

361
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:58,070
one more time before I leave this planet.

362
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,440
Yeah, but...

363
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,740
Dean hates you.

364
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,780
He doesn't hate me. He's just pissed off at me.

365
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,280
I'll be damned.

366
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,940
Hi, Dean.

367
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,530
You dyin'?

368
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:49,410
- What? Is it that obvious? - Well, you're here.

369
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,990
Yes, I am

370
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,160
It's good to see you

371
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,880
- Matt, what are you doin' here? - Hi. That is a long story.

372
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,090
Yeah, I bet.

373
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:05,050
- And who's this? - This is Zooey.

374
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,930
- Yep, Zooey. - Is that Matty?

375
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:08,140
Nice to meet you.

376
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,640
- Hi! - Hey.

377
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,720
Ben.

378
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,850
- Hi, Sarah. - He's dying.

379
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,020
Well, not in our driveway, isn't it? Bring him on in.

380
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,150
And you! Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

381
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,030
Sorry. It was a last-minute thing.

382
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:26,700
- Hey! Hi! - This is Zooey.

383
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,820
Oh, Matty. Well, now she's more like it.

384
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:32,410
I mean, I told him not to marry the other one.

385
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:36,080
- No, I, um... - Zooey is Ben's nurse.

386
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:40,250
Oh, because your auras are conjoined.

387
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:43,170
- I could see that immediately - Yeah. Yeah.

388
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,510
Aunt Sarah here can see auras.

389
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:49,010
- And she can hear sarcasm. - Of course she can.

390
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:51,600
- You guys are gonna spend the night? - If that's okay.

391
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,890
Great. Matty, you and Zooey take your old room.

392
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:56,060
- But we are... not together. - Nope.

393
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,450
Hi.

394
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,370
- Hey. - This was your room.

395
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:12,920
Yeah.

396
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,750
Basically,  seventh, eighth grade through high school.

397
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,210
God, you were really into music.

398
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:24,460
Yep. They say it's the one thing I inherited from Ben.

399
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:31,140
Actually, I would say that the only memories,

400
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:31,640
or good ones,

401
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,180
at least, that I have of him were listening to music.

402
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,180
We had this little den and this old Fisher stereo.

403
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,350
I mean, new at the time, but...

404
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,660
He'd let me play records

405
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,520
when he was goin' through the slides.

406
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:47,520
So, while most kids

407
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,070
had people singin' 'em lullabies to sleep,

408
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:52,490
I had Graham Nash singing "Wounded Bird."

409
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:55,330
Let's see what we have here.

410
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:59,450
Ooh! Pearl Jam. Radiohead.

411
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:02,620
- Nirvana. - What can I say? I was a moody kid.

412
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,640
Yeah, you can tell a lot about someone's past

413
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,460
from the music they listened to.

414
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,920
Then I guess you know a lot about my past now.

415
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,930
What do you think I listened to?

416
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:19,930
Very interesting question. Okay, I'll bite.

417
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:23,350
But in order to do this to the best of my ability,

418
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,110
I have to actually figure out your exact age,so...

419
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:26,570
excuse this.

420
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:30,070
This might be a little rude. What are you? Twenty-eight?

421
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:31,860
- I'm 30. - You are?

422
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:32,820
- Yeah. - Hey.

423
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,780
- Thank you. - Dodged a bullet there.

424
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:39,240
So that means you were a freshman in college,

425
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:39,910
like, in 2000.

426
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,500
Alright.So then you were into...

427
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,420
Sorry to say, but you're a product of your environment.

428
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,040
Top 40.

429
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,740
I'm talking Britney, Christina,

430
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,510
boy bands, N'SYNC, Backstreet Boys,

431
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,340
maybe Alanis when you're feeling dark.

432
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,470
- Please give me some credit. - But then...

433
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,200
But then you started to rebel against

434
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,890
your middle-class suburban values.

435
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,140
- Is that what I was doing? - Mm-hmm.

436
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:03,190
Or possibly you met a guy into alternative music.

437
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:06,810
Why do you assume that I changed for a guy?

438
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:07,560
Maybe he changed for me.

439
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:10,100
No, no. Guys don't change for girls.

440
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,360
Not in college at least.

441
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,950
- When do they change then? - Much later.

442
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:17,120
Usually when it's too late.

443
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,220
Anyway, you started to listen to bands

444
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,660
you thought would make you edgier,

445
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,410
but you're still hopelessly mainstream.

446
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,200
You know, you're sittin' there in your dorm room,

447
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,880
and you're listening to...

448
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,170
Live.

449
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,130
Like who live? What live?

450
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,980
No, the band, "Live."They are called "live".

451
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,550
I don't know of a band called Live.

452
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,050
Live. You know. Like...

453
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,700
I actually could not name a single song

454
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,060
that the band Live had.

455
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,820
That's insane.What about "Lightning Crashes"?

456
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,730
Everyone knows that.

457
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,400
- Oh, my God! - What?

458
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,420
People know it because it's the only pop song

459
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,990
with the word "placenta" in it.

460
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:57,860
You're really bad at this. I was a weird, sad punk.

461
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:00,410
- It was the Smiths, Pixies. - But you loved Live.

462
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:03,580
- Yeah, I loved Live. - Biggest fan. Live's biggest fan.

463
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,870
No, I'm not wrong.

464
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,670
- This isn't bad. - What?

465
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,750
- Galaxie 500. - Oh, yeah.

466
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,420
- Obscure. - Indeed.

467
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,460
- Does your record player still work? - Fucking better.

468
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,010
Let's take it for a spin.

469
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:17,030
How is Hank? Is he married? Is Hank married yet?

470
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,150
- Yeah. - Yeah. Couple of years now.

471
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,700
- Have any kids? - Not yet, but...

472
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,700
You know, they're so young. There's no rush.

473
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,710
So what's so special about these photographs

474
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,910
you need to drive halfway

475
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:32,130
across the country to get them developed?

476
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,380
It's some of my early work.

477
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,840
Stuff I shot years ago.

478
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:39,050
What happens if you get 'em back, and they're garbage?

479
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,800
How do you even know what's on them?

480
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,260
I remember every shot I've ever taken.

481
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:47,020
That's, like, hundreds of thousands of photos.

482
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,770
- You remember all of them? - Yep.

483
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,980
That's impressive.

484
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:55,320
When's my birthday?

485
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:06,530
- February 19. - February 19.

486
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,620
You got it. Yeah.

487
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:23,050
- Last one. - Thanks.

488
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,680
It's good to see them together again.

489
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:29,350
It's good to see you with him.

490
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:34,480
I don't know. He left us.

491
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,440
Hell, he left you guys too.

492
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,700
Now he's dying, so he comes back,

493
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,610
and we're just lettin' him back in.

494
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,280
It's like he's getting away with it.

495
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,870
Matty, look at him.

496
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,580
I mean, does that look like a man

497
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,620
who's gotten away with anything?

498
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,210
Okay, I'm gonna...

499
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:02,880
I'm gonna go upstairs.

500
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,720
Try and get a little work done before I pass out.

501
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,470
Can I take this, put wine it, and drink it in my room?

502
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,270
- Help yourself.,darling. - All right.

503
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,560
- 'Night, sweetheart. - 'Night.

504
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,440
- I'm so glad you're here. - Me too.

505
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,400
- I love you. - Love you too.

506
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:26,360
Hey, guys. I'm going to bed. I'll see you in the morning.

507
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:28,160
- Okay. - All right.

508
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,330
- You good? - Yeah.

509
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,800
Yeah, no, I'm just a little tired.

510
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,750
Gonna get some work done.

511
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,720
I'm glad you're making this trip.

512
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,800
A man should know his father,

513
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,220
no matter what kind of bastard he is.

514
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:54,810
You should come back here more often.

515
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:58,690
- I know. I'm sorry. - That's okay. End of the lecture.

516
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:00,480
- It's good to see you. - Thanks.

517
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,290
Yep.

518
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,870
- Hey, I saw... - Hey.

519
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,500
that your light was still on. I got you a glass of water.

520
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,590
- Thanks. - Yeah.

521
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:23,670
I know those guys can drink, so...

522
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,050
Thought that might help the cause in the morning.

523
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,930
- How are you? - Good.

524
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,890
Is it hard being here?

525
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:32,850
Um...

526
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,770
- So do you want to come in? - Yeah.

527
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:40,480
No. I mean, me, no.

528
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:43,480
- Um, can I sit down? - Yeah.

529
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:48,240
Not weird for me. I guess the weird thing would be...

530
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,580
you know, seein' Ben here.

531
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,040
Is a little, you know, odd.

532
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,510
Sarah... thinks you're beautiful.

533
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:11,470
Okay. Cool.

534
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,770
You are though.

535
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,730
- I think you're drunk. - No.

536
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:26,650
Maybe. I might be, actually.

537
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:29,280
But I'm not saying this 'cause I'm drunk.

538
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,950
And I'm not gonna not say it

539
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,360
'cause I think you'll think I'm only

540
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,500
saying it because I'm drunk.

541
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:34,270
OK.

542
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:36,290
I don't know what we're talking about.

543
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:38,370
- Oh, you didn't follow that? - No.

544
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,750
Then maybe I am drunk. 'Cause I followed it perfectly.

545
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:46,750
Oh, this is a bad idea.

546
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,720
- What? We're just talking. - Yeah, well.

547
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,660
Then you have to talk about the fact

548
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,660
that you're just talking and not just talking.

549
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,060
Right.

550
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,440
- Wait, I'm sorry. I mean... - Oh! Whoa.

551
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,440
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

552
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,700
Holy shit.

553
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,860
- Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay.

554
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,200
I guess I deserved that.

555
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:19,790
Thanks.

556
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,630
- Oh, hey, close your eyes. - Are you gonna get weird?

557
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,130
No. No. Just close 'em.

558
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,550
Okay. They're closed.

559
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,340
Hold on a sec.

560
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,770
Okay, you can open 'em now.

561
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,980
Wow. That's really cool.

562
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:47,650
Yeah, my cousin Hank was really into astronomy.

563
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,980
Yeah, I can tell.

564
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,950
What, um, Ben was saying...

565
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:04,170
...last night at the diner about your... ex-husband?

566
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:09,880
Is that what happened? He cheated?

567
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:17,220
Nothing good comes from reliving the past. You know?

568
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,640
You just sound like my ex-wife now.

569
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:26,230
She used to say that I'd...

570
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:30,480
I had a tendency to live in the past rather than...

571
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,490
embracing the present.

572
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,410
Is that why she left you?

573
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,910
It's never... one thing, now, is it?

574
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,040
What about you?

575
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,420
I don't know. It all just happened so fucking fast.

576
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:53,630
One moment we're just... we're cruising and then...

577
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,140
the next we're driving off a cliff.

578
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,270
The funny thing is, I actually...

579
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:04,260
For a moment there,

580
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,230
I thought I had it together, you know?

581
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:11,980
I thought I was someone to be reckoned with.

582
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:34,340
Oh, my God, Ben. Jesus.

583
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:40,050
- Help. Oh, God. - Ben, what did you do? Are you okay?

584
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:45,730
Yeah, yeah. I just... I just got dizzy, and I tripped over...

585
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:48,850
the corner over here. I was gonna take a shower.

586
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,300
Wait for me before you do that.

587
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,820
Can you move your fingers? Toes?

588
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,780
- Yeah. - Any dizziness or nausea?

589
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:58,740
- Do you have any pain? - No.

590
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,570
Bend your leg for me.

591
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:06,370
Wait. Stop gropin' me. Jesus Christ. What are you doin'?

592
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,660
I need to make sure you don't have broken bones.

593
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,670
- Help me up. - I got you.

594
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,710
- Here you go. - Oh, God. Jesus Christ.

595
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,010
- You don't feel pain anywhere? - No.

596
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:18,760
- Are you sure? - Yeah.

597
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,840
- Oh, my God. - I'm all right.

598
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:27,270
I'm fine. I just need to sit here for a couple minutes.

599
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:28,890
- Okay. - Yeah.

600
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,900
- Thanks, baby. - Oh, my God. Gave me a heart attack.

601
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,450
- Hot coffee? - Yes, please. Thank you.

602
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,420
We should be able to get to Chicago

603
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,920
by late afternoon at the latest, yeah?

604
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,200
That'll give us five days

605
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,130
to get to Kansas before the lab closes.

606
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,300
So you two are screwing now.

607
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,810
I mean, it makes sense. He's low-hanging fruit sexually speaking.

608
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,350
You haven't been laid in what? Three years?

609
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:13,770
- How about we shut up now, okay? - You like your women damaged.

610
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:17,730
- You like to damage yours. - Okay, that's enough. Both of you.

611
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:25,450
I didn't damage you. Did I, Sarah?

612
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,790
- What's he talkin' about? - Ben.

613
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:38,130
- Sarah, what's he talking about? - Nothing.

614
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:43,010
A million years ago before we went on our first date. Nothing.

615
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:45,470
What? Did Sarah never mention that?

616
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:50,350
I can understand why. It wasn't really very memorable.

617
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:55,690
Mostly just a lot of dry humping. Had a couple drinks and couldn't quite get...

618
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:56,810
Shut your mouth, Ben.

619
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:00,740
Though God knows she tried every trick in the book.

620
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,200
- Shut up. - Dean!

621
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:07,330
What are you gonna do, Dean? You gonna come over here and hit me?

622
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,040
There's nothin' left to hit.

623
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:23,340
Christ.

624
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:32,180
- What is your fucking problem? - Can we just calm down?

625
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:35,650
I'm not gonna calm down. Can't watch him shit all over my family.

626
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:38,940
I'm just bustin' his balls for Christ' sake. He's my kid brother.

627
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:43,150
He was more of a father to me than you ever were.

628
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,830
I was just busting his balls.

629
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:58,750
Drama.

630
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:46,220
Doesn't anyone else see how ridiculous it is?

631
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:51,850
I mean, don't get me wrong. You're a really good looking girl, Zooey.

632
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:57,180
You're even sexy in a sloppy kind of way. You got full lips, nice skin, great legs.

633
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:01,270
And I guess, you know, Matt's in decent enough shape.

634
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:04,190
He's got no glaringly bad features.

635
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:08,400
Judging by my own modest dimensions, I doubt he's packing a python in his pants,

636
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:11,370
but I'm sure it's a perfectly adequate cock in a pinch.

637
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:13,530
You're thrown together by circumstance.

638
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:15,870
Neither one of you has demonstrated any ability

639
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:18,250
to sustain any kind of meaningful relationship.

640
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:23,630
To the contrary, you're both especially dysfunctional in that regard.

641
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:28,550
It's going to become very awkward when this situation... goes south,

642
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,510
and it will.

643
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:32,970
- I mean, look at you. - Shut up.

644
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,020
Okay? Just shut up.

645
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:37,890
Nothing happened.

646
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:41,690
- Nothing happened? - Nothing!

647
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:43,860
You were alone in a room.

648
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:45,320
- She's drunk. - I wasn't drunk.

649
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,070
- She's coming on to you. - No, she wasn't.

650
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:51,490
Every star in the sexual galaxy is lined up. You couldn't seal the deal?

651
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:54,370
What do you need? Landing lights between her legs?

652
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:55,910
- Thanks for that. - Huh?

653
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:59,080
- Thanks for that! - Well, no offense. It's just...

654
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:02,170
It's just disappointing. That's all.

655
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,340
Well, really sorry to disappoint you.

656
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,800
Are you ever happy, Ben?

657
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,260
Let me tell you something. Happiness is bullshit.

658
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:13,430
It's the great myth of the late 20th century.

659
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:15,640
You think Picasso was happy?

660
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,720
You think Hemingway was?

661
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,390
Hendrix? They were miserable shits.

662
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,230
No art worth a damn was ever created out of happiness.

663
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,940
I can tell you that.

664
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:30,070
Ambition, narcissism, sex, rage.

665
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:34,240
Those are the engines that drive every great artist, every great man.

666
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,370
A hole that can't be filled.

667
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,960
That's why we're all such miserable assholes.

668
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:47,090
So you know you're a miserable asshole.

669
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:50,670
What? Do you think I'm an idiot? Of course I know.

670
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:55,180
'Course I know.

671
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:53,420
You would have saved us all a lot of trouble if you shot digital.

672
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:58,340
You ever hold a pair of fake tits in your hands?

673
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:02,260
- What? - No matter how good something looks,

674
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,270
- you can't beat the real thing. - Mm-hmm.

675
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:10,190
People are taking more pictures now than ever before.

676
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:14,610
Billions of 'em. But there's no slides, no prints.

677
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:16,490
They're just data,

678
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,820
electronic dust.

679
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:23,620
Years from now, when they dig us up, there won't be any pictures to find.

680
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:29,080
No record of who we were, how we lived.

681
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:33,920
What's the point of having an artifact if you never see it with your own eyes?

682
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,380
You still talking about film?

683
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,550
Never mind.

684
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,510
Hey, Matt, Matt.

685
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:52,940
I don't kid myself that I was any kind of husband or father.

686
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,570
It's not about that.

687
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,450
You just never saw me.

688
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,580
Not once, Ben.

689
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:11,330
I see for a living, Matt. It's what I do.

690
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,840
We better get going.

691
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:55,460
Hey, we just got to the hotel in Chicago. Thanks for the passes for tonight.

692
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:59,250
I have you booked in St. Louis tomorrow night, then Kansas City,

693
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:01,630
- then Parsons for Tuesday. - Okay.

694
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,140
That gives you two extra days before the lab closes.

695
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:09,720
Hey, look, Larry, I'd rather just go straight from St. Louis to Parsons.

696
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:12,430
I just want to drop off this film and get back to my life.

697
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,520
- If that's all right. - Suit yourself.

698
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,810
- You ready for tonight? - Yeah, I'm ready.

699
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,900
- Don't worry about me, Larry. - Good luck anyway.

700
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:21,990
Thanks, I guess.

701
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:50,930
- Okay. - Go, Zooey.

702
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,230
Oh, hey.

703
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:02,650
Before I forget. This is your pass for tonight.

704
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:06,740
- This is the band you're pitchin'? - Yeah. Yeah, that's them.

705
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,080
Why don't you try running your spiel by me?

706
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:13,870
You know, kick the tires a little bit.

707
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:16,750
No. No, I'm okay. Thanks though.

708
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:21,130
Come on. I mean, you're asking a successful band to leave a major label

709
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:23,210
and trust you at a boutique.

710
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:24,840
Let's hear it.

711
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:30,100
Come on. Just give me your pitch. It's good practice.

712
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:32,850
I mean, your career depends on it, right?

713
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,810
Okay.

714
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:39,980
We're not corporate.

715
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:43,570
We're not part of a conglomerate that only worries about the bottom line.

716
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:47,240
We actually are a company that still believes the artist is visionary,

717
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,990
not just a product.

718
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,950
Yeah, don't say any of that. You sound like a pussy.

719
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,450
Never mind. Bad idea.

720
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:56,960
You were always a little timid, even as a little kid.

721
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,830
You have any idea how condescending and insulting you can be?

722
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,040
Just listen to me? These guys are surrounded

723
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:05,090
by people tellin' 'em how great they are all the time.

724
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:07,510
They need that because they're artists.

725
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:10,220
We're all just a bunch of insecure bastards.

726
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,470
So you don't tell them how great they are,

727
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:15,020
you tell 'em what you don't like about 'em.

728
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:18,600
Speak with authority. Not only will they respect you,

729
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:21,980
but they'll believe you're the only guy who can fix it.

730
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:30,660
- Why'd you come on this trip? - What?

731
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:33,830
Don't tell me it's about this "Seven Sisters" or whoever.

732
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:36,700
Spare Sevens. Yeah, no. That's why.

733
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:44,960
And I guess there's part of me

734
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:48,170
that figured this was the last chance I'd have to see you

735
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:52,340
and how you measure up against the bastard I've hated all these years.

736
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,220
How am I doing?

737
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:58,140
You're holding your own.

738
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,860
You wanna know the sad part?

739
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,690
I've actually been trying.

740
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:37,260
- What do you think? - I think they're good.

741
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:38,850
- What? - I think they're good.

742
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:41,940
I think they could use a new record label though.

743
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:43,520
I agree.

744
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:05,040
So... what I was talkin' about earlier...

745
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,750
Thanks.

746
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:12,300
- Sorry. Matt, Matt. What were you saying? - We're talking about creative control

747
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:15,050
and support you're not going to find anywhere else.

748
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,760
I just don't think you should be singin' for your supper.

749
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:21,480
We want to give you the space to record the album

750
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,770
that the whole world is waiting for.

751
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:26,810
- Yeah. - Yeah.

752
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,860
But, um...

753
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:33,610
I'm going to do that no matter where I am, aren't I?

754
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:40,200
Yes, no, of course, but what we're offering is...

755
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:44,000
Matt, you've worked with some serious bands.

756
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:47,420
And some shit bands if I'm being honest.

757
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:50,090
A bit of this, a bit of that.

758
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:52,800
We're on a streak now.

759
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:56,470
Selling out shows, heavy rotation.

760
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,760
If it ain't broke, and all that.

761
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,430
- Right? - Yeah. No. I, um...

762
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,520
I hear what you're saying.

763
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,570
Matt.

764
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:17,740
But it is broke, Jasper.

765
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,990
You just don't know it yet.

766
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:24,620
Or my hunch is... that maybe you do.

767
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:27,670
You did agree to meet with me tonight, right?

768
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:29,790
- Yes or no? - Yes.

769
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:32,380
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Well done.

770
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:35,340
So you were honest with me. I'm gonna be honest with you.

771
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:37,880
I loved your guys' first record.

772
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:39,850
It was amazing.

773
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:43,020
Deserves every bit of recognition that it got.

774
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:45,310
I worked out to it. I fucked to it.

775
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:47,730
It helped me get through my divorce.

776
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,360
Seriously. It's one of those.

777
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:52,610
It was incredible. Because it had balls

778
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:55,440
It was unique. It was original. It was yours.

779
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:59,240
Your second album, however, Alibi.

780
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:03,830
Ironically named, if you ask me, 'cause that thing is anything...

781
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,290
but your first album.

782
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:08,080
It is at best forgettable.

783
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:12,290
Teenagers make that music with a fucking laptop.

784
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:15,170
They do.

785
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:18,680
I don't know whose idea it was to put that dance track on there,

786
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,850
but I bet it wasn't any of you guys, am I wrong?

787
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,680
You don't look at each other when you play the new songs.

788
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:28,060
You just look out straight forward, scanning the crowd for girls.

789
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:32,860
- You're embarrassed. I don't blame you. - What's your point?

790
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:35,480
I think you're better than that. That's all I'm saying.

791
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:37,490
'Cause you're an actual fucking rock band.

792
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:40,700
Drums, guitar, bass, vocals.

793
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,780
Then you add all this other shit you don't need.

794
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:46,410
You're selling albums, but to who?

795
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,960
People that pay attention to fuckin' commercials.

796
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:53,790
I want you guys to get back to what you do.

797
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:57,050
To reclaim what made the Spare Sevens the Spare Sevens.

798
00:59:57,130 --> 01:00:00,430
If you don't, you're just going to be another casualty of the machine.

799
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:04,760
If I didn't believe this, if I didn't believe in you, I wouldn't be here.

800
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:09,430
You have no fucking idea what it took me to get here.

801
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:21,780
Fuck.

802
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:23,240
Fuck, man.

803
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:32,000
You've got a massive pair of balls on you, don't you?

804
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,420
Yeah.

805
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:37,550
They make my dick look really small.

806
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:46,010
Okay, man.

807
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:49,310
Okay.

808
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,310
How do you see this working?

809
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:55,020
Glad you asked.

810
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:58,280
- I have to take a look at your contract. - This geezer pissed himself.

811
01:00:59,110 --> 01:01:01,070
This geezer pissed his pants!

812
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:09,240
Get the old codger a nappy. Get him a diaper!

813
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:11,750
Shit!

814
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:13,830
Fucking hope not.

815
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:17,040
Get him out.

816
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:20,380
I don't even know what happened.

817
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:23,340
Sorry. Sorry, Matt.

818
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:25,550
What were you sayin'?

819
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,600
Matt?

820
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:38,270
You guys are newly famous, so by default you're going to be assholes.

821
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:39,610
What?

822
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:43,900
The sad thing is there's a big part of me that would still love to sign you.

823
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:50,540
But I can't even pretend to have anywhere...

824
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:55,120
close to some type of respect for any of you.

825
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:03,260
You know what? Thank you for the beer.

826
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:05,260
And good luck.

827
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:07,140
Matt.

828
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:47,090
I got it.

829
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:51,140
Here. Keep the change.

830
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:54,470
You're welcome.

831
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:59,150
I'll see you guys in a little bit, all right?

832
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:02,690
- Where are you goin'? - Just gonna take a few moments

833
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:04,280
to collect my thoughts.

834
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:07,700
By that, I mean I'm gonna get fucked up across the street.

835
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:14,080
- Well, that was something, huh? - That was stupid.

836
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:18,420
What? He should have closed the deal.

837
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:20,750
He was defending you.

838
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:22,960
Don't put this on me. It wasn't my fault.

839
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,670
- That's not the point. - I'm standing here in my own piss.

840
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,010
Maybe you could try to get to the goddamn point.

841
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:31,340
The point is, you're gonna thank him tonight, and you're gonna mean it.

842
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,470
Ben. Ben!

843
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:41,150
I... I can't do this anymore.

844
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:46,230
I love you, and you know that but...

845
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:50,030
you don't make it easy. You make it virtually impossible.

846
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:53,200
But Matt, he's here for you. It doesn't matter what he says.

847
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:57,040
He... He came on this trip for you.

848
01:03:57,830 --> 01:04:00,620
You have done nothing to earn his love,

849
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:02,420
but tonight he gave it to you anyway.

850
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:07,460
And he did that for you, and if you can't find it in yourself

851
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:11,010
to show your son. Just, like, an ounce of kindness,

852
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:15,060
then I... I can't... I'm done defending you.

853
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:16,470
I can't be your nurse.

854
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:20,060
I don't know how to help you.

855
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:25,070
Are you done?

856
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:27,940
Yeah.

857
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,400
Okay.

858
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:38,240
- What does that mean? "Okay." - You're fired.

859
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:01,270
Is someone sitting here?

860
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,520
No.

861
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:12,610
How's he doing?

862
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,410
He's overcome with gratitude.

863
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:21,330
- Really? - No. Mm-mmm.

864
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,160
Nope. I need a drink.

865
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:24,870
Hey,

866
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:31,090
can I please get, like, any semi-decent reposado on ice, please?

867
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:35,050
- Let me ask you something. You were there. - Mm-hmm.

868
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,720
It was happening, right? Like before I had my little freak out?

869
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:41,980
- I had 'em, yeah? - Yeah. You did.

870
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:47,560
- So I really screwed myself. Okay. - That's not how I see it.

871
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:51,690
I appreciate that, but...

872
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:55,700
I don't know if you realize what kind of opportunities are out there

873
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:57,320
for a guy like me at this point.

874
01:05:57,410 --> 01:05:59,030
Like, a handful?

875
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:02,450
Mmm. Zero... is the right answer.

876
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:07,040
Then, once word of this gets out, it's gonna be even less.

877
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:14,050
- The word is officially out. - And are you fired?

878
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:16,090
Uh, no. Not quite.

879
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:18,510
Apparently I'm "fried."

880
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:21,890
- Now I'm fired. There we go. - Good.

881
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:26,480
- Don't laugh. At least you got a job. - Oh, no. I was actually just fired too.

882
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,770
- You're joking. - No. I'm not.

883
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:34,110
- What? Why? - It's fine. He does it a lot actually.

884
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:38,820
- So, cheers to that. - Cheers.

885
01:06:38,910 --> 01:06:40,530
- Cheers. - Cheers. Here we go.

886
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:46,080
- Want another one? - No! God!

887
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,250
- If I had any more, I'd get surly. - Oh, yeah?

888
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:50,420
- Yeah. - I'd pay to see that. Are you sure?

889
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,880
Okay, well, that would be your funeral, buddy.

890
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,180
What's this?

891
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:08,650
- This is Live. - What?

892
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:10,160
You're singing Live right now.

893
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:12,070
You said you didn't know the band Live.

894
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:13,100
This is Live. You're singing it.

895
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:14,280
No. I think you misread anything.

896
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,400
- I think you're drunk. You're hallucinating. - I'm not drunk.

897
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:17,700
No, I heard you.

898
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:25,160
You lied to me.

899
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,690
Well, I should probably...

900
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:24,820
- What are you doing? - I'm going to the airport.

901
01:09:25,950 --> 01:09:30,290
- What are you talkin' about? - Yeah. This was a mistake.

902
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:33,250
No, it wasn't.

903
01:09:33,330 --> 01:09:34,830
Hey, slow down.

904
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:39,210
I've already called a nurse to replace me and...

905
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:42,880
she should probably be here by breakfast.

906
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:46,260
Hey, Zooey. Come on. What is this? What's goin' on here?

907
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:50,560
Hey, come on. You can't just leave.

908
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:53,140
- What about Ben? - He fired me last night.

909
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:54,640
So what? You said he fires you all the time.

910
01:09:54,730 --> 01:09:57,520
- Yeah. Now I'm takin' him up on it. - Okay, but why now?

911
01:09:57,610 --> 01:10:00,110
- Why? What is going on? - I can't do this, okay?

912
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:02,150
Do what? What are you talking about?

913
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:05,360
- I'm not going to hurt you. - You don't know that.

914
01:10:05,950 --> 01:10:08,870
Look. I get it, okay? Your husband cheated on you.

915
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:10,240
I'm not him.

916
01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:14,000
Okay, well, he didn't cheat on me. OK? I cheated on him.

917
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:18,500
And I couldn't even tell you why. I went and fucked someone.

918
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:24,010
So what? So what? You made a mistake.

919
01:10:24,090 --> 01:10:26,220
It was three years ago. He was the wrong guy.

920
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:28,680
No. I am the wrong girl.

921
01:10:29,890 --> 01:10:33,350
Zooey, what about what you said to me, "Nothing good comes from living in the past."  Right?

922
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:36,390
Yeah, and then you told me I sounded like your ex-wife.

923
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:17,100
Ben.

924
01:11:20,770 --> 01:11:21,770
Hey.

925
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:28,610
Hello?

926
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:33,030
Thanks, man. I appreciate it. It will just take a second.

927
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,500
He's probably just in here. Hey, Ben?

928
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:40,630
Oh, shit! Hey! Ben!

929
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:42,710
Ben! Are you okay?

930
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:45,510
Sir! Sir! Go get help! Please!

931
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:48,420
It's okay. You all right?

932
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:50,300
- This is Beta One, come in. - Go ahead.

933
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:53,680
- Will you get help? - We have a possible Code Blue in 428.

934
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:54,890
It's okay.

935
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,670
So I checked in with Ben's oncologist in New York and shared some blood work.

936
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:30,720
We can keep him comfortable, but at this stage of cancer, that's all we can do.

937
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:33,760
Now we can arrange for his transfer to hospice,

938
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:37,680
but I am afraid he will not be able to travel back to New York.

939
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,730
We're actually on our way to... Kansas.

940
01:12:43,690 --> 01:12:45,230
Oh, that's off the table.

941
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:47,940
Matt, your father is very weak,

942
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:52,910
and while we can keep him comfortable here, he really doesn't have much longer.

943
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:54,950
I'm sorry.

944
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:58,370
I'll check back in in a little bit.

945
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,160
- Yeah. Thank you. - You're welcome.

946
01:13:31,070 --> 01:13:32,820
Coffee smells good.

947
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:38,620
You want some?

948
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,690
How are you feeling?

949
01:14:07,730 --> 01:14:10,690
I'm dying. That's how I'm feeling.

950
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:15,400
How long have I been here?

951
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:19,490
Like a day and a half... about.

952
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:24,120
Where's Zooey?

953
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:29,210
- She left. - Is she gone?

954
01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:35,420
I fired her before. It's the first time she ever actually left.

955
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,680
Do me a favor. Don't tell her I'm here

956
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:42,890
She might blame herself.

957
01:14:43,470 --> 01:14:44,850
Of course.

958
01:15:55,710 --> 01:15:56,710
Need help?

959
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:07,640
- Goes in that little slot there. - Yeah, I know. I remember.

960
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:10,980
Stretch it out. Nice and tight.

961
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:14,570
Line it up so the teeth will bite.

962
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:17,440
- Click it twice. - That's right. Yeah.

963
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:20,030
Yep.

964
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:22,530
Good job.

965
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,710
I used to feed you.

966
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:34,500
What?

967
01:16:35,210 --> 01:16:37,590
At night while your mother slept.

968
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:40,760
Give you the bottle.

969
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:50,730
We were staying in this crappy little apartment, Lower East Side.

970
01:16:53,310 --> 01:16:57,530
Then afterwards you'd lie... you'd just lie there...

971
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:00,900
with your head on my chest.

972
01:17:02,570 --> 01:17:04,570
You had this...

973
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:08,660
smell, you know, the way babies smell.

974
01:17:10,290 --> 01:17:11,620
And I would just...

975
01:17:12,330 --> 01:17:14,210
I'd just hold you.

976
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:18,380
Feeling you breathe.

977
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:26,760
I'd make all these promises to you.

978
01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:33,640
Tell you that I'd love you forever,

979
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:37,060
always keep you safe,

980
01:17:42,030 --> 01:17:44,160
never let you feel alone.

981
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:51,700
I was just filled with this...

982
01:17:54,370 --> 01:17:56,670
infinite love for you.

983
01:18:08,930 --> 01:18:14,100
I don't know what happened to me, what broke inside of me.

984
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:19,610
Maybe I was always broken. I don't know.

985
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,860
But those nights with you, if I could...

986
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:29,410
get to choose what time of my life to live in forever, that would be it.

987
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:37,630
That would be it. And I'm not asking you to forgive me. I don't deserve....

988
01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:45,630
I just...

989
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:53,600
I love you.

990
01:18:54,850 --> 01:18:56,440
And I'm sorry.

991
01:18:59,810 --> 01:19:01,070
And I'm sorry.

992
01:19:25,710 --> 01:19:27,680
It's okay.

993
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:30,300
Go to sleep. Okay? You're tired.

994
01:20:32,530 --> 01:20:33,950
Knock, knock.

995
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,490
What do you got there?

996
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,290
Your getaway vehicle.

997
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:43,040
If we're gonna get that film to Dwayne's, we gotta drive through the night.

998
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:45,670
Tomorrow is the last day they're developing Kodachrome.

999
01:20:46,130 --> 01:20:48,300
Never gonna let you take me out of here.

1000
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:50,300
That's why I'm not gonna ask.

1001
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:59,850
It appears I got this tube in my dick.

1002
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:04,190
- Shit. - It's all right. I can get it. I got it.

1003
01:21:04,270 --> 01:21:07,150
What do you mean you can get it? No. No, no, no, no. Hey!

1004
01:21:07,650 --> 01:21:11,530
You can't pull out your own catheter! Stop it! Stop it! That's crazy!

1005
01:21:11,610 --> 01:21:13,070
Oh, God.

1006
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:15,870
Dad! Don't!

1007
01:21:18,410 --> 01:21:21,910
Fuck you. Get dressed.

1008
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,960
- I got you. - You did get me. Here.

1009
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,740
Parsons?

1010
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:38,160
Parsons.

1011
01:23:06,730 --> 01:23:10,190
It has been this way for the last few months or so.

1012
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:15,570
People coming in from all over the world, all just to develop some film.

1013
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:20,570
If you ask me, they should stop making film every year.

1014
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:26,000
All right, I've got you in a single, king.

1015
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:30,630
No. No, we had... two rooms. Separate rooms reserved.

1016
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:34,960
- Actually, three, but we only need two. - I'm sorry. It's been insane.

1017
01:23:35,050 --> 01:23:37,760
Just... we don't know who's coming and who's going.

1018
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,050
Right now all I've got is the one room.

1019
01:23:41,970 --> 01:23:43,510
One sec.

1020
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:51,900
- We'll take it. - Super.

1021
01:23:52,810 --> 01:23:56,240
I should have it ready for you in three or four hours.

1022
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:59,570
- Super... - Fuck you. That's fucking cra... Okay.

1023
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:01,530
That's great. That's great.

1024
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:05,830
Sorry. Long drive. That's great.

1025
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:09,370
Watch your step.

1026
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:17,380
- Hi. - Hey.

1027
01:24:17,670 --> 01:24:19,470
Um...

1028
01:24:19,550 --> 01:24:24,680
Excuse me. I wanted to give these rolls to Dwayne personally.

1029
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:28,890
I'm sorry. We stopped taking Kodachrome yesterday.

1030
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:33,310
You what? No. I called to confirm. We were told Thursday.

1031
01:24:33,770 --> 01:24:36,860
I know. I'm sorry. We ran out of dye sooner than expected.

1032
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:42,030
Come on. Look, we just drove 2,000 miles to get here. I just...

1033
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:44,320
- Where's Dwayne? - Ben Ryder.

1034
01:24:44,410 --> 01:24:46,290
- There he is. - You made it.

1035
01:24:46,410 --> 01:24:48,330
- How you doin'? - Good to see you.

1036
01:24:48,410 --> 01:24:51,960
Your assistant here just told me you're not processing any more Kodachrome.

1037
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:54,840
- She's fired. You're fired. - Okay, Dad.

1038
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:58,760
Honey, this is Benjamin Asher Ryder,

1039
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:01,220
one of the world's greatest living photographers.

1040
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:03,390
How do you do? This is my son, Matt.

1041
01:25:03,470 --> 01:25:05,390
- Matt, nice to meet you. - You too.

1042
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:09,560
Well, Ben, I will process these myself.

1043
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:13,020
I left a little room in the line on the off chance you made it.

1044
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:15,770
Yeah, I was countin' on it. I appreciate it.

1045
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:19,030
Can you believe it? The end of an era.

1046
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:23,910
I will have these ready for you to pick up tomorrow.

1047
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:26,830
- Okay. Thank you. - You're welcome.

1048
01:25:31,790 --> 01:25:33,250
We could get food. You hungry?

1049
01:25:33,330 --> 01:25:35,500
Yeah, I should put something in my stomach.

1050
01:25:35,580 --> 01:25:36,590
Yeah, same.

1051
01:25:37,710 --> 01:25:40,590
I'm sorry. Aren't you Benjamin Ryder?

1052
01:25:41,170 --> 01:25:43,380
- That's right. - I don't believe it.

1053
01:25:43,550 --> 01:25:47,180
I should have known you'd be here. I was talking about you to Steve McCurry.

1054
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:48,930
I figured Steve would be here.

1055
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:52,230
- Ernie Coates from National Geographic. - Ernie.

1056
01:25:52,310 --> 01:25:55,400
You did that piece in Afghanistan, didn't you? Yeah, that was great.

1057
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:56,400
Wow, you know...

1058
01:25:56,480 --> 01:26:01,230
At the risk of embarrassing you, you're the reason I became a photographer.

1059
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:04,610
Why would that embarrass me?

1060
01:26:05,110 --> 01:26:06,700
Marie, come here.

1061
01:26:09,950 --> 01:26:13,040
- This is Benjamin Ryder. - No way.

1062
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:14,370
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

1063
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:16,830
A bunch of us were talking about your Afghan series.

1064
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:20,460
Can you believe they're stopping it? You must've been pretty pissed.

1065
01:26:20,590 --> 01:26:23,720
No, not really. A little sentimental, I guess, but...

1066
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:26,890
just a matter of time, you know.

1067
01:26:26,970 --> 01:26:29,260
You know. Oh, geez.

1068
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:32,970
We're all so... so frightened by time,

1069
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:35,480
and the way it moves on, the way things disappear.

1070
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,190
That's why we're photographers.

1071
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:40,820
We're preservationists by nature.

1072
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:43,690
We take pictures to stop time,

1073
01:26:45,110 --> 01:26:47,410
to commit moments to eternity.

1074
01:26:49,910 --> 01:26:52,540
Human nature made tangible.

1075
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:58,040
About as good a definition of art as any, I guess.

1076
01:26:58,130 --> 01:27:01,750
Ben. Rick Ross. We were in Grenada together.

1077
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:04,550
- We were shooting for Reuters. - Oh, my God.

1078
01:27:06,090 --> 01:27:08,970
- Good to see you. - Good to see you too.

1079
01:27:09,050 --> 01:27:11,510
Ben, do you mind if I get a picture with you?

1080
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:14,270
Would it matter if I did? I don't know.

1081
01:27:14,390 --> 01:27:16,390
Sure. That's okay.

1082
01:27:20,020 --> 01:27:21,650
- Aw, that's great. - There you go.

1083
01:27:21,730 --> 01:27:24,230
- Thank you. - You all be well now.

1084
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:26,280
- You too, Ben. - Good to see you.

1085
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:02,190
Do you hear that?

1086
01:28:07,190 --> 01:28:09,150
Hmm. All right.

1087
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:13,370
What should we do this evening? Huh?

1088
01:28:14,660 --> 01:28:18,620
We could go see what Parsons, Kansas has in the way of nightlife.

1089
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:21,750
I could actually eat again.

1090
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:26,840
Don't know if they have room service here. Should we get a pizza?

1091
01:28:27,550 --> 01:28:29,670
Go to a restaurant? Order in?

1092
01:28:30,340 --> 01:28:32,640
Hello? Any thoughts on the matter?

1093
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:56,910
Okay, Dad.

1094
01:28:58,700 --> 01:28:59,750
Okay.

1095
01:30:43,270 --> 01:30:44,810
- Hey. - Hey.

1096
01:30:48,730 --> 01:30:50,610
I'm sorry about Ben, Matt.

1097
01:30:54,610 --> 01:30:57,530
I've been on the phone with the medical examiner's office,

1098
01:30:57,610 --> 01:30:59,620
tryin' to get the body released.

1099
01:31:00,530 --> 01:31:02,830
Should be good to go shortly.

1100
01:31:04,330 --> 01:31:06,160
- Thanks, Larry. - Mr. Ryder.

1101
01:31:07,330 --> 01:31:09,210
Dwayne from Dwayne's Photo.

1102
01:31:09,290 --> 01:31:11,630
Yes. Hi. I remember you.

1103
01:31:12,090 --> 01:31:14,760
Uh, this is Larry Holdt.

1104
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,220
- Sure. - Ben's manager.

1105
01:31:17,510 --> 01:31:21,720
I was... very saddened to hear about your father.

1106
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:25,270
I wanted to deliver these personally.

1107
01:31:25,930 --> 01:31:28,810
I know he was very protective of his work.

1108
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:33,900
Thank you. Yeah. My dad would have appreciated it.

1109
01:31:34,610 --> 01:31:37,110
Outside a roll I shot myself,

1110
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:41,450
these are the last rolls of Kodachrome film ever to be developed.

1111
01:31:41,950 --> 01:31:45,500
I think he would have liked the symmetry.

1112
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:48,830
Yeah.

1113
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:51,130
Take care.

1114
01:31:51,630 --> 01:31:52,920
You too, Dwayne.

1115
01:31:59,930 --> 01:32:01,510
- Here you go. - Oh, no.

1116
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:04,560
Ben was very direct about it.

1117
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,810
He said you'd curate the show.

1118
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:13,440
I don't know anything about photography. Why would he do that?

1119
01:32:13,570 --> 01:32:17,650
I learned a long time ago never to ask why where Ben was concerned.

1120
01:32:23,370 --> 01:32:24,660
Hold on.

1121

Larry Holdt.

1122
01:32:32,670 --> 01:32:38,510
Now boarding zone three for Flight 164 to LaGuardia Airport.

1123
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:45,310
Hi. It's Zooey. I'm not here. Please leave me a message.

1124
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:48,350
Hi. It's me again.

1125
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:52,190
It's hard just talking.

1126
01:32:54,230 --> 01:32:56,780
I've been thinking about you a lot. Um...

1127
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:03,110
I don't know. I've just been realizing

1128
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:06,490
I've given up on so much stuff in my life.

1129
01:33:08,410 --> 01:33:09,910
Playin' music and...

1130
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,330
my marriage.

1131
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:15,130
Ben.

1132
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:21,260
I'm tired of doing it. I don't want to do it anymore, and I'm not gonna. And...

1133
01:33:22,220 --> 01:33:24,140
Well, I want you to be...

1134
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:29,180
I'd love for you to be one of the things I don't give up on.

1135
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:35,150
All right, I'll hang up now.

1136
01:33:38,730 --> 01:33:40,940
Okay. Bye.

1137
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:28,590
Let's see what all the buzz is about, Ben.

1138
01:37:35,260 --> 01:37:37,970
Hey. Hey.

1139
01:37:41,350 --> 01:37:42,730
Hey.

1140
01:37:46,150 --> 01:37:48,440
How'd you know I'd be here?

1141
01:37:50,230 --> 01:37:51,320
Larry.

1142
01:37:52,740 --> 01:37:54,450
- Oh. - Yeah.

1143
01:37:54,530 --> 01:37:56,990
I guess the guy really does know everything, huh?

1144
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:58,580
Yeah.

1145
01:38:04,830 --> 01:38:06,500
Are they all like that?

1146
01:38:11,590 --> 01:38:14,220
Yeah.

1147
01:38:19,220 --> 01:38:20,970
Do you want company?

1148
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:24,440
Yeah.
