1
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,271
Hey!  It's about time to go to the airport.

2
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:50,339
What are you scratching?

3
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,317
It's time to go to the airport!

4
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:54,477
I'm on my way for the pick-up.

5
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,251
Wow!  Is she nuts?  Seriously!

6
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:04,126
Everything but the word "Koo" is torn.

7
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,235
Why is Mr. Suen not picking me up?

8
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,603
Toothpick's arranging your press conference.
He's busy right now.

9
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,109
How did you know his nickname was Toothpick?

10
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,205
I know you're Chopsticks.

11
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,148
Chopsticks are from wood and your name is
Forest Koo.

12
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,021
What else do you know?

13
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:32,388
I know that chopsticks are utensils used for
picking up food.

14
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:36,259
Toothpicks, on the other hand, are used for
leftovers.

15
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:42,527
Please keep your hands off my precious sword.

16
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:46,295
You're a music conductor.
Why do you carry a sword around?

17
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:50,342
I like to strike the sword after striking
the baton.

18
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:53,044
You're a renown conductor.

19
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,013
Your baton must be very outstanding.

20
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,015
Can I take a look at it?

21
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,380
I only take it out on performance.

22
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,216
I'm actually very fond ofyou.
I admire you very much.

23
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,018
I've even got your posters!

24
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,081
Like the one where you held the baton.

25
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,557
You look very handsome and sophisticated!

26
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:08,254
Could you sign an autograph for me?

27
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,228
Chauffeur...pull over here please...

28
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,163
We haven't arrived yet.

29
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:20,069
What are you doing, Mr. Koo?

30
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:21,435
I've got my own car.

31
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,066
Will you take me along?

32
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,440
Sorry.  I don't have any spare room.

33
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,447
Please excuse me.

34
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,510
See you later.

35
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:39,389
Hey, Mr. Koo!

36
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,202
You're always like this.
Rest after every couple of steps.

37
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:03,079
Of course, I'm like this.  I'm pregnant!

38
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:07,017
We can never get home like this.

39
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,020
What are you giggling for?

40
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,323
Haven't you seen a gravid lady before?

41
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,594
Want me to teach you a lesson, you little punk?
- Yes...I've seen it before...

42
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,098
He's staring at you.

43
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,371
This stuff is perfect for us to use.

44
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:40,580
Why don't we buy a karaoke set and take it home?

45
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:44,383
What's wrong?
- Pain!

46
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:45,584
What's happening?

47
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,419
I'm having labor pain!
What?  You need to deliver now?

48
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:51,361
I need some help.  She's now in labor!

49
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,386
Help!

50
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,366
Bring some hot water right away!

51
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,496
Ouch!  Don't touch my abdomen!

52
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,163
I'm deliver right away after one touch.
Bring some hot water!

53
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:02,070
What are you standing there for?
Come over and help out!

54
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:06,336
Hurry up!
Hurry!  Over there!

55
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,276
Why are you idling over there?

56
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:10,339
Aren't you a human being?  Why aren't you giving
any help?     -Don't touch me!

57
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,384
Bring out some ofyour humanity here!

58
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,183
Are you okay, honey?

59
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,619
My stomach hurts!

60
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:16,587
Does it?
- Yes!

61
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,988
Does it feel better now?

62
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,426
Stand back, everyone!  Thanks!
What's the matter?

63
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,331
She's going to give birth.

64
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:29,665
Then call the police.

65
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,162
No need.  I'm not giving birth now.

66
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,305
Didn't you just say that you wanted to be
in labor?

67
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,637
I can't give birth right now.

68
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:36,634
What's wrong with you?

69
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,166
What do you mean by saying what's wrong with me?

70
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,111
A big group of men watching over my wife
to give birth?

71
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,340
Then, tell your wife to give birth!

72
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,110
What the hell?

73
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:44,577
Let's go!

74
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,551
Lunatic!
- Excuse me!

75
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:47,450
Nothing to see here.

76
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,978
Please excuse me.

77
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:56,351
Get out of the car...

78
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,556
Take this...

79
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:05,264
Don't stand in my way!  Over there!
Let's go!

80
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:08,601
Sister...

81
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,404
Sister!
- What is it?

82
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:13,377
Coming here to borrow money again?

83
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,643
Of course, not!  I've got something good for you.

84
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,343
Something good? Are you really my brother?
Yes!

85
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,442
Fellow co-workers, I've brought something good
for all ofyou today.

86
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,045
Ifyou want a good bargain,
please come with me.

87
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,418
Come on...you won't regret it!

88
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,185
Come on...yes, big sister...
Isn't it great?

89
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,989
Original price was $100.  Now, it's $80.

90
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,461
I owed you $500 last time.

91
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,191
This CD playerworths more than a grand.

92
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:33,391
Now, don't say I've got nothing good to offer.

93
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,458
Did you steal this?
- Steal?

94
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:38,231
My friend switched to another profession and sold
all of this stuff to me for a very cheap price.

95
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,398
So I brought them over to sell it to your
co-workers.

96
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:44,442
Hey!  Take...take care of my big sister!

97
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,570
Give her a good discount.

98
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,578
Sister...this...
Who's your sister?

99
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,274
Well, somebody's sister, this one...

100
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,478
Does your mother know that you went out today?

101
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,181
Sure...this one was originally priced at $100.

102
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,588
Now, it's on for sale at $30.  You can't find it
anywhere at this price.  Take a good look!

103
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:02,253
Hey...dearfellow co-workers...you know what...

104
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,159
You won't believe there's good things being sold

105
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:04,492
for cheap unless you actually see it with your
very own eyes!

106
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:07,032
Check it out even ifyou're not buying, fellow
co-workers!

107
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,666
Is there anything nice this time around, Jacky?

108
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,534
Of course, there is!  Why wouldn't there be any?
We've got all different sorts of goods here!

109
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,093
It's cheap and durable.

110
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,104
Is there something for me?
Take a look!

111
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:13,162
Definitely!  Of course, there's something
for you!

112
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,004
There's something for people ofall ages.
This way please.  Hurry!

113
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,567
Yes...over there...

114
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:22,341
Check it out before it's all sold out.  Hurry up!

115
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,211
What do you think about this room?

116
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:31,280
Ifyou don't like it, you can always change
the room.

117
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,224
Besides, I don't have to pay the money.

118
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,451
Come over here and take a look.

119
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:42,630
This is the reading room, the kitchen, and the
dining room.  Bedroom is on the other side.

120
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:45,068
You can call for room service ifyou get hungry.

121
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:47,038
I don't have to pay for it.

122
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,600
But I do have to pay for this.

123
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:56,975
Thank you.
- Thanks.

124
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,484
I'm sorry.  I gave too much.

125
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:03,988
This bed is big enough for

126
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,615
you to do anything you want.

127
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,318
You haven't returned for 10 years.

128
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,421
Would you like me to prepare some local chicks
for you to enjoy?

129
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,031
I'm a vegetarian now.

130
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:16,330
You may be a vegetarian but
how about your little friend over there?

131
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,996
Well?  How do you like this room?

132
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,471
Not bad.  It's pretty quiet too!

133
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,334
I'll open the door first.

134
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,376
Hey, Yip!

135
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,449
Hello!
- Recognize him?

136
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,009
Hey, Yip!  How do you do?
- Chopsticks!

137
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:35,247
Long time, no see!
That's right.

138
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:36,419
Is that your little brother?

139
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,253
His wife.  Thanks.

140
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,849
A woman?

141
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,853
It's the blind wonder.

142
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,530
It's been a long time, Chopsticks.

143
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,123
Well?  How's everything?

144
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,724
Hey, Blind Wonder!
- Hello!

145
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,804
Hey!  Why is Blind Wonder completely blind now?

146
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,235
Unfortunately, he never thinks of himselfas
a blind man.

147
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,409
You look better after shaving offthe beard.

148
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,639
I'm Toothpick.  Chopstick's over there.

149
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:04,448
Hello, Chopstick!  How are you?
You're looking good!

150
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,418
I hear some chicks coming.  I'll open the door.

151
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:09,979
You don't need to open it.  You're blind.

152
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,991
Hey, Jumbo!
- Chopsticks!

153
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,289
Hey, Chopsticks!  Haven't seen you for over
10 years!

154
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,023
You're keeping a pretty good figure.

155
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,030
Are you talking about these chickens?

156
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:21,157
I've grabbed two live chickens from the farm
just foryou.

157
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,599
Great!

158
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:26,162
It's hard to find a "home chicken" to eat
in Hong Kong nowadays.     -It is!

159
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,570
We have guests arriving.
I'll open the door.

160
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,074
You're blind...don't wander around...

161
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:31,132
Sit down...

162
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:32,339
Keep an eye on the chicken.

163
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,307
Chewing Gum!

164
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,178
How are you?  Long time, no see!

165
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,580
Did you come alone?
- No.

166
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:40,643
Hurry up!  This is my wife, Jenny.
- Hello!

167
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,350
My sister-in-law Jackie.

168
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:45,482
My sons, Jimmy and Johnny.

169
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:46,991
My youngest son, Joey.

170
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,186
My mother-in-law, Judy and my dog, Bobby.

171
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,286
This is my brother-in-law also named Bobby.

172
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,193
How do you do?

173
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,198
That's his girlfriend.  What's your name again?

174
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,063
Jobie.
- Jobie!

175
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,299
I told you not to do this.

176
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:59,099
You're known for spitting out gum after chewing.

177
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,072
What happened to you?

178
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,437
He accidentally swallowed it down.

179
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:04,032
So it's been stuck with him ever since.

180
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:07,637
Daddy, the baby's hungry.  Where's the milk?
- Coming...

181
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,080
The milk powder's with you.
Oh no!  The chicken has flown off!

182
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,012
My son would also like to drink some milk.

183
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,382
Watch out for the kids!

184
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:16,586
Please take care of my kid for a while.

185
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,647
I'll boil some waterfor the milk.
Let's play mahjong!

186
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,422
Since everybody's here, why don't we play some
mahjong?

187
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:21,426
I'll also play.

188
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,984
You're blind.  How can you?

189
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:23,654
I can feel the tiles with my fingers.

190
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:25,429
But you guys will have to tell me what you
discard.     -Mr. Chopsticks.

191
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:26,431
Please look after my dog.

192
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,763
-Count me in for the mahjong game.
Here's no mahjong set.

193
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,166
I have.

194
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,262
Please look after my dog.  Thanks.

195
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,272
And keep an eye on the chicken as well.

196
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,300
I haven't been this happy foryears.

197
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:39,606
How long will you stay?  A month, isn't it?

198
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,636
Yes.
Then we can party every night.

199
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,175
Not every night.  Just every other night.

200
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:47,049
This is all foryou.  Take this.
I'll go play mahjong.

201
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,986
We have to attend the press conference.

202
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,114
I'll only play for a couple of rounds.
I'm coming...

203
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,131
Excuse me, miss.  What are you doing here?

204
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,073
I'm waiting for someone.

205
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,265
What's this?

206
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,040
This is all the other stuff.  Where's the pastry?

207
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,604
Sorry, sir.
We don't serve pastry at the cocktail lounge.

208
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:18,640
But I like it.  I've booked it in advance.

209
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,316
Fine...I'll order someone to buy it for you.

210
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,617
Mr. Koo, I'd like to ask how long you plan to
stay here for.

211
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,485
Approximately, over a month.
Excuse me.

212
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:29,551
Mr. Koo, I'd like to ask...
Please.  One at a time.

213
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:30,391
Please excuse me.  Thanks.

214
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,658
Mr. Koo, I...
I told you to stand in line.

215
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,489
Mr. Koo, you've performed in many parts of
the world.

216
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:38,230
Which ofthese places have left you with the
deepest impression?

217
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,133
My shoelaces are untied!
- India.

218
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:44,609
What attracts you most about India?
- The food.

219
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,080
After you finish this concert, Mr. Koo,
where's your next stop?

220
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,514
After this, I'll be going to Australia and Japan.

221
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,280
How is it, fellow reporters?
Have you all finished with the questions?

222
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,584
We've still got this four-eyes here.

223
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,013
Me?

224
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,049
Yes.  It's your turn now.

225
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,385
Is it my turn?

226
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:09,229
Mr. Koo, have you...had dinneryet?

227
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,402
Not yet.

228
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:18,407
Good answer.  Thank you.  Thanks a lot!

229
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,137
What's wrong?

230
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,340
Can't I show concern for others?

231
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:26,613
You guysjust keep on asking.  He is hungry.

232
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:31,413
Yes...let's have some snacks, everyone.
Let's go!

233
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:34,185
I've got someone to buy you some pastry.

234
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:37,295
I have one more question foryou, Mr. Koo.

235
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:40,125
Why does it look all dark over there?

236
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:45,034
What did you eat?  Why is it dark?

237
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,504
African chicken.
- Really?

238
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,633
Mr. Koo, I suggest that you should head back to
your room and wash up.

239
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:51,609
Good idea.  Let me help you with the washing.

240
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,544
No thanks.

241
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,175
Don't just hold that sword of his.

242
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,323
Wait a minute!

243
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,258
Sir, can you do me a favor?

244
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:14,459
I've been chased by some bad men.

245
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,661
Do you mind if I can hide in your room for
a while?

246
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,401
Don't you know how to call the police?

247
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:20,132
I guess you haven't lived in Hong Kong for
a long time.

248
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,538
Even our chief commissioner gets robbed.

249
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,304
Please.  I beg you.

250
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,310
Otherwise, I'll be dead for sure.

251
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,006
Sorry to botheryou.

252
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:31,044
Do you live alone?

253
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:33,278
Yes, but I've had many friends who came to
visit me.

254
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,479
What shall I do?

255
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:36,544
What do you mean?

256
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,992
What happened?  How'd it turn out like this?

257
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,225
Come in.

258
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:52,360
Blind Wonder, Yip!

259
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:55,471
Where are you heading offto, Blind Wonder?

260
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:59,342
Is anyone in?  Is everybody gone?

261
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:03,245
Have a seat.  I've got to get changed.

262
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,160
Hey, what are you doing in there?

263
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:17,219
Thanks for saving my life.

264
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,252
I want to give you a little present.

265
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,094
That's me.

266
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,132
Have you gone insane?

267
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:24,202
Hurry up and take a picture!
Don't get in my way.

268
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:25,362
Hey!  What are you doing?
Hurry up!

269
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:26,598
Jacky, hurry up and take a picture.
What pictures are you taking?

270
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:29,266
Aren't you that reporter?

271
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,370
Hold...hold it...

272
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,570
Hold onto his legs.
No pictures!

273
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:33,600
Stop taking pictures!
- Hurry!

274
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,513
Don't let him touch you!
What the hell are you doing?  Stop this!

275
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:37,607
This is called adultery caught on film.

276
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,141
Ifyou want it back, bring $30,000 to us.

277
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,244
Thirty grand!

278
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,084
Wow!  Are all these people trying to take
adultery photos?

279
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,589
They've even got us in the photo.

280
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:51,059
Happy birthday to you...

281
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:54,361
Happy birthday to you...
Hey...don't let them go!

282
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,130
Happy birthday to you...
They're taking my photos!

283
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,466
Blow the candles.

284
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,439
They're taking my photos!
Ignore them...

285
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,009
Who told you to be poor?

286
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:16,579
I take risks forwork.  I'll do it...

287
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,983
Why don't you just discard that piece of
junk car?

288
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:28,431
I'm getting a fever...I'm working my ass off...

289
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,434
Hey...there it is!

290
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:34,432
Where's Jacky?
- He's inside.

291
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,046
What's the meaning ofthis?

292
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:51,415
Isn't that enough?  Go away!
Enough!

293
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,048
Hey!  Your sister's coming!

294
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:56,528
I don't care.  Take her away.  She's annoying!

295
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,257
Hey, punk!

296
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,265
Pipe down, bitch!

297
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:01,390
Come out!

298
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:02,991
No way!  What'll you do about it?

299
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,128
Will you come out or not?

300
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:08,104
Mom!  Help!  She's trying to kill me!
Jack...

301
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,606
You killed me, bitch!
How are you doing, Jacky?

302
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:14,010
How do I remove this, Jacky?

303
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,308
That hurts!

304
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:17,372
Just bearwith the pain.  I'll pull you out.

305
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,075
What the hell was that?

306
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,643
It hurts.  It's breaking off...

307
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,454
Punk!

308
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,421
Bitch, you've locked me long enough!

309
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:29,552
Now it's your turn to be the caged animal!
Open the door!

310
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,358
Done!  What do we do now?

311
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,160
You numbskull!  Obviously, we head out for
some fun.

312
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:34,062
Let's go!

313
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,227
Open up!
Have fun inside!

314
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,254
Last night, I saw this strange man in a dream.

315
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,495
He taught me a special skill known as
"The Speedy Hands".

316
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,435
Everything from the unbuttoning of someone's
pocket, stealing the wallet,

317
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,597
to re-buttoning again would take less than
a second.

318
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,266
Do you know how long is in a second?
Tick-tock!

319
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,569
"Tick-tock", my ass!

320
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:20,066
See?  It's gone.  Idiot!

321
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:21,136
-Teach us!

322
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,580
Don't speak of the word "teach".
We'll do research next time.  Okay...

323
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:26,015
Remember that moustachio from the other day?

324
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:30,577
Fine.  Now I'll demonstrate it to all ofyou.
Okay!

325
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,988
Go over there and pretend that you fell down.

326
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,323
Fall down?  It lacks presence and it doesn't
look good at all.

327
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,522
You'll look fine ifyou fall down after wearing
lipstick.

328
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:38,392
Aren't I right?

329
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,624
Ifyou fall down, his ass will move aside.

330
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,227
Then I can...

331
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,131
I'll time you.

332
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,102
-What's the need in timing me?
It takes a split second to succeed.

333
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,662
Hey, you got it!

334
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,272
Fall down...

335
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:57,339
Just fall...no need for the lipstick...
you're pretty enough...

336
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:06,183
Fall down...just fall down right away...

337
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,353
Sorry, sir.  It's too crowded on this side.

338
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,386
Try the other side.
- Yes...

339
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:18,498
Excuse me, mister.
You made her fall and left her in disregard.

340
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,505
How can you leave like this?
Yeah...

341
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,006
You messed it up!

342
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,635
You don't even know how to trip overyourself.
Go home and sleep!

343
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,477
He didn't even stick out his butt.
Yeah...

344
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,570
Come here, you...
- What?

345
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,343
Get over there and seduce him.

346
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,508
It's so embarrassing.

347
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,041
You're the best at this kind ofthing.

348
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,211
Now go!
- Fine!

349
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,499
Hey, moustachio.  How do you read this word?

350
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,368
Big boobs.

351
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,304
Hey...

352
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:57,206
What are you doing?
Help!  Help!

353
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,179
Run...

354
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:06,212
Don't let him get away!

355
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:11,254
Don't give it back to him...moustachio...

356
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,985
You again?

357
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,052
Aren't you the reporterwho pulled a prank on me
that day?

358
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,025
Give me those negatives back!

359
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,330
Hey!  Didn't you get your wallet back?

360
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,028
No fun at all!

361
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,434
Hand over the negatives!
What negatives?

362
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:26,994
The negatives...
- No way!

363
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,008
Give it back...     -I won't.
What are you going to do about it, moustachio?

364
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,270
You won't?

365
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,452
Good morning, sister.

366
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,249
Let me introduce you to a friend of mine.

367
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,120
Hey!  Let's go!

368
00:18:56,101 --> 00:19:01,266
Jacky, I haven't got on the car yet!

369
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,105
Alright.

370
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,011
Give me the wallet back.

371
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,982
Take it.  Ifyou lay a finger on me,
I'll shout out the words "sexual harrassment".

372
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,323
Hey!

373
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,599
Come on!  Get over here!

374
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,639
Be careful!
- Get over here!

375
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:43,273
Forked road up ahead.  Lay siege on her!

376
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:51,222
That's enough, young lady.

377
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:55,056
Don't come any closer.  I'll shout!
Where's my wallet?  Give it back to me!

378
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:58,594
Harrassment!
- The wallet!

379
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,461
Get in the car.  Hurry!
Help!

380
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:04,059
The wallet!
Jacky, save me!

381
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,439
Hold it!  Freeze!  Come over here!

382
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,636
Stop the engine, step out and hand over your
driver license!

383
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,200
What the hell?

384
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,469
$36.80? That's expensive!

385
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,499
It usually costs me $17.90.

386
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:47,671
That's right.  Why is it so expensive all of
a sudden?

387
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,243
I'll head in first.

388
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,978
That's the price according to the meter, ma'am.

389
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:55,316
How would I know ifyou sped up the meter?

390
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:57,281
Hello.

391
00:20:57,356 --> 00:21:00,587
Officer, I'm Marmadonna.

392
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,594
I've come for my daughter Philidonna.

393
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,118
Who again?

394
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,164
Would all ofyou police officers care to have
a cup of tea?

395
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:09,224
That's right, officers.  Have some tea.

396
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,099
I'm here for someone.

397
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,168
Forget it...

398
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:15,503
May I have a piece of that cake?

399
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,374
Hey!  Over here!

400
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,347
After a long day ofwork, take a tea break!
Have some tea!

401
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:24,576
Don't be shy.
- Mommy!

402
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,483
Mommy's coming, dear.  Don't be scared.
Mommy!

403
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:29,281
Let me deal with it for you.

404
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,321
Officer, please don't place any charges on her.

405
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:32,653
My daughter is not a runaway child.

406
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:38,019
Have some tea and dessert, officer.
Have some tea!

407
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,326
Does your mother bake cakes for a living?

408
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,233
Yes, I'm the owner of St. Madonna Bakery.

409
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:49,297
We have chain stores all over Hong Kong,
Singapore, Malaysia, North America and Europe.

410
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,501
Ma'am, your daughter...

411
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:53,010
What happened to my daughter?

412
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,308
This man claims that your daughter has stolen
his wallet.

413
00:21:55,347 --> 00:22:00,216
What?
Hey, moustachio!  My daughter stole your wallet?

414
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:03,415
Don't let her have it!  It must be your brother.
Have some cake!

415
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,479
Sir, her little brother must have influenced
my daughter to do this!

416
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,389
You should arrest her!  Press the charges on her!

417
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:08,358
Please make it clear.

418
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:10,520
Your daughter's the one giving my little brother
the bad influence.     -What?

419
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:12,189
Isn't it?

420
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:13,288
Don't you believe this?

421
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,597
Would my little princess ever become a bad
influence to this auto-mechanic pauper?

422
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,103
Please show a little more respect!
Wealth doesn't mean anything.

423
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:20,570
Are you slamming the table?
- Yeah!  So what?

424
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:24,102
Settle down, you two!  We know what to do.

425
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,269
What happened, Chopsticks?

426
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:27,335
You came at the right time!

427
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:30,507
What are the charges?  Sexual harrassment?
Which is it?

428
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,540
He claims that my daughter stole his wallet!

429
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:34,245
That's impossible!  Don't you agree with that?

430
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:35,617
Mom, it was only meant as a joke.

431
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:39,055
That's right!  The young lady's toying with you
for a joke.

432
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:40,251
Don't you have a girl as well?

433
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,055
Yes...he has many girls.

434
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:43,026
Just like his name.

435
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:46,030
Chopsticks.  It's specially made for picking up
the good ones.

436
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:49,030
I'm not married yet.

437
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:50,999
But he's got a naughty little brother.

438
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,560
Tell your daughter to take good precaution.

439
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,500
Who are you?

440
00:22:56,575 --> 00:23:00,067
I'm the head manager ofthe Hong Kong Arts Group.
This is my business card.

441
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:02,113
I'm also his manager.

442
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,111
Perfect!  This young woman wants to press
charges for sexual harrassment.

443
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,451
Sexual harrassment?
How could you do that to my daughter?

444
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,614
Tell me!
How could you do such a thing to my daughter?

445
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:14,386
She stole my wallet, I wanted to take it back and
she screamed out the words "sexual harrassment".

446
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,220
It wasjust a joke, Mom.

447
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:18,252
Baby, this is more than a simple joke!

448
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,230
Ifyou wanted some fun, just tell me.

449
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:22,290
I've got plenty ofcake shops and department
stores.

450
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:24,234
I can notify the staff to make the preparations
for you

451
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:26,294
so you may steal to your heart's content.

452
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:29,034
That's no fun at all!
Especially when it's been prepared!

453
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,132
Baby, you...

454
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:32,666
How do you raise that daughter ofyours?

455
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:35,404
Officer!

456
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,538
John!

457
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,276
What's the matter, Madonna?

458
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:41,183
Uncle.
Girlsjust want to have fun.

459
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:43,517
No, ma'am!
Your daughter has committed a criminal offense.

460
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:44,522
How can that be?

461
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:48,025
How could my daughter steal other people's
things, John?

462
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,425
Help me out.  The least I can do is, return your
negatives back.

463
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:53,260
So whose wallet did she steal again?

464
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:57,057
It's nothing...we're just having fun!

465
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,000
Why did you help her?

466
00:23:59,037 --> 00:23:59,969
Her mother doesn't know how to raise her
properly.

467
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:02,097
You should give a chance to the young lady.

468
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,108
Everything's fine now, Madonna.

469
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:05,609
You may leave with your daughter now.
Yes.

470
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:06,609
Let's go home now.

471
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:09,307
Thanks, officers!  Bye-bye now!

472
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,317
So, can we go now?
Sure...

473
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:17,212
Ms. Kam.

474
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:19,216
What is it?

475
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:21,452
Can you ask your brother to hand over the
negatives back to me?

476
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:22,983
What negatives?

477
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:26,395
He tricked me that other day with a bunch of
people and took some photos of me.

478
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:30,501
That little bastard!  I'll see what I can do.

479
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:35,038
How's this, you vegetarian?

480
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:36,301
You won't pick this one up.

481
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:38,275
Then, she's mine!

482
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:47,112
Go back with Chopsticks first.
I've got somethings to do.

483
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,313
Go now...come on...

484
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,089
Where are you going, Ms. Kam?
I can give you a ride.

485
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:55,251
No thanks.  I've got my own car.

486
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:58,396
That's great.  I don't.
Why don't you give me a ride?

487
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:11,266
Are you alright, boss?

488
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:13,300
Let's see how you'd feel ifyou tripped over
yourself!

489
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,681
I told you not to press on the gas.
It's on fire now!

490
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:20,150
I never thought that bitch was awful like that.

491
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,421
Who did you say was "awful"?

492
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:25,419
It's nothing...let's go...

493
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:26,389
Did you get hurt from the fall?

494
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:29,154
He's alright.  Let's get moving!

495
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:34,255
You pervert, you deserved to get blackmailed!

496
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,094
Me?  A pervert?

497
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:41,332
Hey!  Shouldn't you know your brotherwell?

498
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:43,067
Alright!  That's enough!

499
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:45,507
Anyway, I'm getting your photos back.

500
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,440
This fiddle head's surely hard to pick up.

501
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:53,246
What fiddle head?  It's a fiddle stick!

502
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:56,049
I'll fiddle you!  Let's go!

503
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:08,324
Hello.  Is Mr. Koo there?

504
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,231
You don't need to know who I am.

505
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:12,031
You're someone famous with a reputation.

506
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,595
I'm sure you wouldn't want these embarrassing
snapshots posted around the streets, right?

507
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:16,573
Then, you should pay me 30 grand.

508
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:19,277
What?  Don't you know what "30 grand" means?

509
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:20,209
You're such a fool!

510
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:23,237
"30 grand" means $30,000.  Now you...

511
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:24,578
Sis...

512
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:27,345
How dare you attempt to blackmail someone,
you little bastard!     -What are you doing?

513
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,252
You want to die, kid?
No!  Many people are watching!

514
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:31,312
It's embarrassing.

515
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:33,256
You feel embarrassed now, don't you?

516
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:51,167
Hey!

517
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:54,308
He's amazing, isn't he?

518
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:55,468
Isn't he?

519
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:13,621
Alright!  This section's over.

520
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:15,360
I'll buy dinnerforyou guys tonight!

521
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:20,469
Now, we'll practice the 39th section.

522
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:34,142
Hey...

523
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:38,144
How long are you going to practice?
I'm in a hurry.

524
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:40,252
Be quiet.

525
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:50,457
Hey!  Your photos are here!
Whether or not they're needed, it's up to you.

526
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:22,358
Ms. Kam!

527
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:24,425
What is it?

528
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:26,103
Thanks!

529
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:28,128
Be careful next time.

530
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,605
There won't be any.

531
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,302
Well, how would I know?

532
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,536
Ifyou've got time next Saturday,

533
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:34,567
you can come to my recital.  It's on me!

534
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:37,604
You mean the music you were playing now?
It grates my ears!

535
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:41,381
Ifyou're not there for the music, you can
watch me conduct.

536
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:43,046
It's not easy on the eyes either.

537
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:48,018
Hey!  Why don't we go for karaoke tomorrow night?
Sure!

538
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,993
See you later!
- Bye!

539
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:53,391
Hey, four-eyes!  How can I find you?

540
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:56,559
Write down the number to my hotel.  It's 524...

541
00:28:57,335 --> 00:29:00,031
Robbery!

542
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:06,035
Robbery...

543
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:08,211
Freeze!
- Robbery!

544
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:09,978
Thank you!

545
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:13,009
Robbery...
- Don't run!

546
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:16,546
Are you okay?

547
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,989
Ouch!  That hurts.
Where does it hurt?

548
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:22,492
It hurts.  You're stepping on me.

549
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:25,590
You should have told me earlier.

550
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,263
Do me a favor and shut the doorwhile
you're at it.

551
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:38,142
Please take a seat.

552
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,473
I'm going to heat up my brother's meal.

553
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,538
You treat your brother pretty well.

554
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:50,381
Would you like some coffee?

555
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:52,412
Sure.  Thanks!

556
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:20,244
Have some coffee.

557
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:23,212
What's wrong with your TV?  Picture looks
distorted.

558
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:27,122
It is.  Jacky made it malfunction by pressing
things at random.

559
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:35,394
Hey, moustachio!  Move it!

560
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:44,231
Hey!  Move it!  I want to watch the TV.  Not you!

561
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:50,105
Hey!  Go over there!  Over there!

562
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:58,051
Help me out here, moustachio!

563
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,623
You can't open it like this.

564
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,560
Get me a spoon.

565
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,393
A spoon!

566
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:11,330
Hurry!

567
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:13,233
Hey!  Hurry up!

568
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:15,565
Hey!  Dinner's ready.

569
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:18,375
Rice with roasted goose and BBQ pork.  Nice!

570
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:19,671
Thanks, sis!

571
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,571
What's wrong with you?
How can you lock your brother like this?

572
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:26,549
He's not your brother.  You won't understand.

573
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:28,609
This kid is always wrecking havoc outside.

574
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:30,484
Sooner or later, the police will lock him away.

575
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:33,081
It's betterfor me to lock him up instead of
the police.

576
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:34,557
My sister's very nice to me.

577
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:37,288
I've got food, entertainment and music.

578
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,353
I even get candies every now and then.

579
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,991
Shut your trap, you little bastard!
Drink up the water!     -Yes, sis!

580
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:49,362
Weird kid!  As soon as you pay less attention
to him, he'll run amok.

581
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,035
It'll be impossible to break free when you keep
him behind bars.

582
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,304
That's where you're wrong.

583
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:56,143
Even ifyou've given him an iron spoon,
he can make his escape by digging a hole.

584
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:58,512
That's why we only use plastic spoons
around here.

585
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,387
Thank you.  Now go...

586
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:17,195
That little bastard made his clothes so damned
dirty.  I'll be washing myselfto death here!

587
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:19,536
You're pretty weird too.

588
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:23,267
Sometimes, you treat him nice.
Other times, you hit and scold him to death.

589
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,276
You don't have a little brother.
You won't understand.

590
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,608
Since early childhood, he's been nothing but
trouble.

591
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,010
He doesn't bother with his studies either.

592
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,379
He gets badly influenced by hanging around those
thugs everyday.

593
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:34,345
As for me, I can't go to school even if
I wanted to.

594
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,010
Why?

595
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:39,023
Oh, forget it!  Nobody told me to be someone's
elder sister.

596
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:41,384
Your little brother's actually not that bad.

597
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:44,190
He's just playful.  He'll be fine ifyou show
him patience.

598
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:45,419
Don't I need to work?

599
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:46,394
I work from early mornings to night.

600
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:47,659
I don't have the time to teach him!

601
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:51,264
I'm not like you.  You can make a lot of money by
striking your baton.

602
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,293
My life isn't as cozy as yours.

603
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:55,232
Give me a hand here!

604
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:14,488
It's not that dirty.

605
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:31,434
Baby, you always complained about how I never
have time for you.

606
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,410
I've finally come with a solution.

607
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:35,036
Now I can spend every minute with you.

608
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,377
I can talk to you at any second.

609
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:39,541
Mom, how about your mahjong sessions?

610
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:42,509
Occasional socializing is a must, isn't it?

611
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,216
Are you ready, Mrs. Ma?

612
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:46,587
I'm coming!

613
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:48,488
Didn't you say you were going to spend time
with me, Mom?

614
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,426
Ifyou're bored, just watch some TV.  Be good.
Mommy loves you!

615
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:55,227
Hurry up!

616
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:57,063
Well, you know.  I do all ofthis for my
daughter.

617
00:33:57,101 --> 00:33:57,590
Rolled the dice yet?

618
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:59,034
It's been rolled already.  It's nine.

619
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,096
You're a canine?  Come...pick your tile.
It's your turn now.

620
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:12,577
Hi, baby!  Now you can see me and I can see you!

621
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:15,051
If anything, just call out my name!

622
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:22,593
As you should all know, my baby relies on me
a lot.

623
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,254
Can't see her any less.

624
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:29,031
Your daughter's beautiful and she's got a
camera face.

625
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,399
Of course, she does.  Like mother, like daughter.

626
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:36,266
Where are you going, miss?

627
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:37,035
What are you doing here?

628
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,168
Madam has ordered me to look after you.

629
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:45,605
Why are you following me?
This is my home.  Not a prison cell.

630
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,508
Milady.

631
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,478
Please don't run away, milady!

632
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:53,319
Otherwise, I can't keep an eye on you.

633
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,086
Mommy!

634
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:58,425
What's the matter, dear?  I'm right here.

635
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:02,422
Why did you call out for me, baby?
What's the matter?

636
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,534
What's the matter?
- It's nothing.

637
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,536
Hey!  Where are you going, baby?

638
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:09,233
I'm going back to jail!

639
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,113
It's going to be 24 rounds after this game.
Do you still want to continue?

640
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,142
Why not?  We can play till the next morning!

641
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:23,983
That's great!

642
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:27,354
Madam...the lady's gone.
What?

643
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:29,382
I can't find her after searching through every
room.

644
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,392
What?

645
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:42,066
Wait for me here.
Okay.

646
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:46,404
Hey!  Where did you take my baby?

647
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:48,067
Who took your baby?

648
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:51,274
Your little brother!  He's giving a bad
influence to my baby!

649
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:55,544
Please get out!  You'd better tell me or else,
I will call the police.

650
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,588
You're standing in my way, fatty!

651
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,020
Who's standing in your way?
I've come to find my daughter!

652
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:01,547
I've gone to your brother's garage and
they said he didn't go to work today.

653
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:03,116
You're his sister.  You must know where he went.

654
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:06,061
Hey!  Are you listening to me?

655
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,291
Don't pretend to be deaf!

656
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:10,425
I believe you two siblings are like one and
the same!

657
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:13,470
You're both bad people.  I'm going to sue you.
Hey!

658
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:15,233
Where are you heading offto, bitch?

659
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,069
Hey!  I'm talking to you!

660
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,602
What's the meaning ofthis?
Why are you hanging me up there?

661
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:23,205
Hey!  Let me down!

662
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:24,976
Hey!

663
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,014
Help!  Let me down!

664
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:30,145
Help!
What's happening?

665
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,418
It's nothing.  Just a fat lady singing up there.
Put me down!

666
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,548
Singing?
- Yes!

667
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:35,058
Help!

668
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:45,033
Follow me.  It's upstairs.

669
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:48,596
Hey!  Why does your home have so many staircases?

670
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:59,179
Walk faster and close the door behind you.

671
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:07,455
I've kept my brother locked inside.
How could he possibly kidnap your daughter?

672
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:09,259
Jacky!

673
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:18,262
That little bastard!     -See?  Now do you
believe that your brother took my daughter away?

674
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:26,569
Jacky Kam Chi-Kit!

675
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,068
Jacky Kam Chi-Kit!

676
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:34,445
You little devil!  Put the phone offthe hook!
No wonder my calls couldn't get through.

677
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:36,977
Where's Jacky?

678
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:38,488
How would I know?

679
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:41,081
What are you looking at?

680
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:42,523
It's not suitable foryou.

681
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:43,560
Let me see this.

682
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,061
It's not for you!  It's pornography!

683
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,122
Let me see it!  Don't stand in my way!
It's not suitable foryou.

684
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:50,056
Where is it?

685
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:51,396
There!

686
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:52,493
Nothing here.

687
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:54,561
Yes!  It's right there!

688
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,334
It's here!

689
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:57,636
That's right!

690
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:59,438
Hey!  What are you staring at?

691
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:00,671
I'm staring at what you're staring at.

692
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:02,445
Dispicable!

693
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:03,604
If it's dispicable, then why are you looking
at it?

694
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:06,242
I'm a girl.  Can't I look at girls?

695
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:13,352
Such a bad figure!  I've had enough.
Back to you.

696
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,988
What is that?

697
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:22,498
Comic books.

698
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,091
Let me take a look!

699
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,605
You're an adult now!
Why do you still read such pornographic material?

700
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:40,980
Right!  It makes no sense to read comics when
you have a live person to look at.

701
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:46,347
What do you want?
I have many things that I want.

702
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:49,322
Sexual harrassment!
I'm just kidding.  No need to shout!

703
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,555
Sexual harrassment!
Don't!  Just stop it!

704
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:53,392
Otherwise, I'll seriously rape you.

705
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,089
Rape!

706
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:59,093
No...
- Let me go!

707
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,628
No...don't scream!
Help...

708
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,443
No!  Stop it!
Help!  Rape!

709
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:12,311
I was only joking with you.
Rape...

710
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:17,013
No!  I was only kidding!

711
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:26,994
Help!

712
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,020
No!

713
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,224
Help!

714
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,531
What's the matter?

715
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:38,472
Jacky!

716
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:40,373
What's going on?
Little Devil wants to rape me!

717
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:41,537
Where is he?

718
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:46,242
It's good that you're back, Jacky.

719
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:48,542
Good?  Like hell, it is!

720
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:49,985
I won't do it again!

721
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,511
Rape?  How dare you attempt to rape your
friend's girl!  You little bastard!

722
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:57,118
Rape?  Rape...

723
00:39:57,528 --> 00:40:00,588
Get back in there and rape all you want,
you little bastard!

724
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:06,365
Philidonna, let's go.  Don't cry.

725
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,174
What are you doing?

726
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,610
Shut up.  I've come to settle the score with you.

727
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:25,080
Last time, you scolded my mother at the
police station.

728
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:26,384
That caused my mother to scold me at home.

729
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,322
You gave me a spoon this morning and

730
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:29,188
taught me how to make my escape with it.

731
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:30,158
You knowingly understood that I can't stand my
mother's scoldings

732
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:31,421
and it would cause me to run away from home.

733
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:33,453
You knew all along that once we leave our homes,
we'll have nowhere to go.

734
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:35,522
You knew all along that I can't survive without
my mom's support.

735
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,260
Last time, you said that you'll give her
a chance at the police station.

736
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:39,064
Now we're giving you the chance to give us
a chance.

737
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,263
You'll have to take care of us.

738
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:42,101
First, you'll need to give us 10 grand.

739
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,595
Sure!

740
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,275
Here's more than the amount.

741
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:52,247
Hit the road or else, I'll call the police!

742
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:54,242
Hit him!

743
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:55,307
I can't.

744
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,217
You hit me before I even started!

745
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:01,114
Cover me!
I can't!

746
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:03,391
Very nice, Philidonna!

747
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:05,259
Go to helL!

748
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:14,093
The Buddhist Palm?

749
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:18,602
Hey!  Trying to take advantage here?

750
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,583
Go to hell!

751
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:37,450
Don't kill me!

752
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:49,233
That was amazing!  What is this stance called,
great warrior?

753
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:50,501
The Jaded Maiden Sword Stance.

754
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,243
Get out!

755
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:03,044
Master, we are willing to be your slaves.

756
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:05,055
But all our eating and living expenses will be
on you.

757
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:10,586
You?

758
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:14,063
So late ofyou to come.  What's the matter?

759
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:18,133
Do you realize that your brother has run away?

760
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,328
I knew it.

761
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:22,336
But he won't be so lucky next time.

762
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:31,271
Hey!  What are you doing?

763
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:33,608
I'm going to lock up that runt as soon as I
fire up that metal cage.

764
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:36,077
He won't be able to make any escapes next time.

765
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,254
Are you serious?

766
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:51,501
You do know that it's illegal to do this,
don't you?

767
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:55,027
If I don't do this, he'll come out and commit
another criminal offense.

768
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:57,306
How did you know that my brother ran off?

769
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,001
He just came to see me.

770
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:03,104
Really?  Where is he now?
I have to get him back!

771
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,611
He's gone.

772
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:08,581
That runt!  Ifyou see him next time,
don't forget to notify me right away.

773
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:12,012
Alright...I've got to go now.

774
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:14,320
Okay.  Hey!  Don't forget to close the door on
your way out.

775
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:23,563
Hey!  Not this one.  The main door!

776
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:30,673
Hey!  Could you please grab the keys on the
coffee table and open that door?

777
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,574
That's the one.

778
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,170
See you tomorrow!

779
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:38,441
Hey!  What are you doing?

780
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:43,282
Hey...where are you going?

781
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,281
You must have locked people up pretty often.

782
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:47,415
Now it's time for you to get locked.

783
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:49,584
Hey!  Come back!

784
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:53,387
Don't assume you can get away by locking me in,
you lunatic!

785
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:56,058
Think I don't know how to burn the bars down?

786
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:10,504
Hey...you'd better let me out!

787
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:49,449
Hey...eat something first!

788
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:57,187
I won't!

789
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,393
Wow!  Why do you look so furious?

790
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:02,057
Take my position and see ifyou like it.

791
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:04,329
Now do you realize how it feels to be locked in?

792
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,233
Then why do you still keep your brother behind
bars?

793
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:10,400
It requires love and patience to raise a child
properly.  You can'tjust threaten them.

794
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,233
It's between my brother and I.  This is none of
your business.

795
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:16,346
Fine.  If it's none of my concern, I'll leave.

796
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:20,483
Hey...don't go!  Let me out!

797
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:27,214
I could do that but you've got to promise to
never lock your brother in again.

798
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:31,050
Fine!  Just let me out first!

799
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:32,560
Then it's a deal!

800
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:34,188
Hurry up!

801
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,330
Where's the key?

802
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,409
But you've got to promise me that you'll never
lock your brother up again.

803
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:48,001
Fine!

804
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:50,272
Hey...

805
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:52,372
It's your turn now.

806
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,551
Sorry.  I gave you the wrong key.

807
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,557
This is the right one.

808
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:07,121
Quit fooling around.

809
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:17,499
Mr. Koo, your students are having a feast inside.

810
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:20,271
And they're even performing Chinese opera.
It's entertaining!  Jaded Maiden Sword Stance!

811
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:25,577
I've been pierced by you.  Pierce...

812
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:28,449
Hey!  Why are you playing around with my sword?

813
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:30,112
It is the Jaded Maiden Sword Stance, after all!

814
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:32,281
This is a real sword.  You can get hurt.

815
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:33,346
Where's Jacky?

816
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:34,982
He's inside.

817
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:37,520
Hey!  Greet the master!  Master...

818
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,186
Master...

819
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,292
Why are you playing with my flute?

820
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:42,992
Is this a flute?

821
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:45,591
Higher!  That's how the master taught you!

822
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,661
This stance is called
"The Dual Dragons Out To Sea".

823
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:53,102
I'll teach you another stance called "Pushing
The Canoe Down The Stream".  Don't come over!

824
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:56,408
What are you doing?  Why did this happen?
How could you beat him up like that?

825
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:58,607
Not my fault.
What do you mean by saying it's not your fault?

826
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:01,017
Why do you two fight each other at first sight?

827
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:02,518
She's hitting me, master!

828
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:06,588
Hey!  What the hell is wrong with you?

829
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,352
Does it look nice?  I think it does.

830
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:11,122
I made this painting, master.
Does it look like you?

831
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:13,163
Can't you pipe down, you little runt?

832
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:17,296
Get out!

833
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:19,597
I am Lyre Demon.  Don't sustain any injuries
through the sound of my lyre!

834
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:23,167
Stop playing it!  Play with my koto!

835
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:24,333
That's an antique!

836
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:26,569
No wonder it looks so old!

837
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:31,013
My music scores are useful.

838
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:33,448
Get out!

839
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:39,216
Get out!  Go!

840
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:42,252
Hands off me!  I don't really know you that well.
Tell me!  Just tell me if I'm right about that.

841
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:44,089
Give them a little love and patience?

842
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,594
Isn't that the same?

843
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:47,324
This little bastard can't be treated nicely.

844
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,298
What little bastard? Are you referring to me?
Shut up!

845
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:51,301
Go home with me!

846
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:53,596
Master...

847
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:56,231
We only thought it'd be fun.  We were wrong.

848
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:57,331
Give us another chance!

849
00:47:57,407 --> 00:47:59,534
Please give us another chance!

850
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:01,043
Master!

851
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:08,280
Master...give us another chance...

852
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:09,574
Don't do it again next time.

853
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:12,417
Next time?  And you've let them stay?

854
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:14,457
It's none ofyour business!
Shut up!

855
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:19,993
Kids get a little playful.  They'll be fine
after they lash it out.

856
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:23,191
I'll find something foryou to lash out on
tomorrow.

857
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:25,329
Why don't you thank the master?

858
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,597
Thank you, master.

859
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:34,604
Have no fear, o' dying branch!

860
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:37,637
For I am a thousand year old tree.

861
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:40,245
I fear no rain or storms.

862
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:44,014
CrawI up to me!  Quick!

863
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:46,386
Crow...Crow, it's your number.

864
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:52,084
What are you?  You're a crow!

865
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:54,188
Now you look like a chicken!

866
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:56,426
Crows can fly.  It should fly a little higher.

867
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,459
Wow!  That's it!  Now, that's what I call a crow!

868
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,232
Would letting it out like that change a child?

869
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:06,274
Art is used for releasing their expressions.

870
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,541
Using broken tires and exhausted pipes as art?

871
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,342
I've got plenty at my garage.

872
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:13,539
This is too boring for me to watch!

873
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:15,244
I've got to work on a night shift.
I'm going to leave now.

874
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,274
Let me escort you out.

875
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,582
Okay!

876
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:26,323
That reminds me.  You asked me to attend
your rehearsal tomorrow night.

877
00:49:26,363 --> 00:49:27,625
Is it artsy?

878
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:31,124
It is artsy but it won't bore you.

879
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:33,091
We'll wait and see.

880
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:14,695
Isn't that amazing?

881
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:17,331
Yes, very fantastic.

882
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:21,403
You really don't like music, do you?

883
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:24,573
Not really but I just don't know how to
appreciate yours.

884
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:28,340
Listen to it more and you'll learn how to
appreciate them.

885
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:31,419
So what kind of music do you like?

886
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:02,449
Did you know about the charity ball coming
tomorrow night?

887
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:04,249
Who are you asking to be your dancing partner?

888
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:08,451
Baron Chan's daughter is on the list.

889
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:13,225
Chairman Ho's sister-in-law, Councillor Wong's...
Enough...

890
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:15,060
Say no more.  I already have a partner.

891
00:52:15,098 --> 00:52:17,464
So, who's your latest pick-up?

892
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:20,197
Can't you stop reminding me about the past?

893
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:23,466
This is for you.

894
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,066
I just bought some new clothes.

895
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:28,134
It's in preparation for tomorrow's ballroom
party.

896
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:30,645
Ifyou don't think it goes well with you,
I can get another one.

897
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:33,039
I'll go and get changed right away.

898
00:52:35,285 --> 00:52:37,480
So she's going to be your dance partner?

899
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:40,251
I'll leave her to you.
Me?

900
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:44,059
Oh, I see!

901
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:47,488
So that's why you reek of petroleum these days!

902
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:50,096
So are you trying to court that garage chick?

903
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:52,298
Be a little more respectful!

904
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:54,400
You look so serious.

905
00:52:54,437 --> 00:53:00,034
You said it yourself.
This is a fiddle head, not a fiddle stick.

906
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:03,636
Really?  It's not too shabby.

907
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:30,435
You're gorgeous!

908
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:32,065
You're pretty punctual.

909
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:33,302
I've always been punctual.

910
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:34,503
It's hard to get a cab around here.

911
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:36,205
Ifyou don't mind, I can drive.

912
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:39,207
No thanks.  I've got a car.

913
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:40,307
You've got a car?

914
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,476
Please park it properly.

915
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,112
What took you so long?

916
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:20,384
Sorry.  Allow me to introduce two people to you.

917
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,254
They're our sponsors.

918
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:25,050
Don't drink so much, Jim.

919
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,593
It's just a little bit!

920
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:33,396
Just give me a little bit!

921
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:42,268
Just a little more!

922
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:45,039
Mr. Chan was really a great help this time
around.

923
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:46,241
Thank you.

924
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:48,648
You've got a phone call, Mr. Chan.
Okay.

925
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:51,679
Hey!  Do I look beautiful?

926
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:55,421
You look like a turkey.

927
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:56,425
Turkey.
- How is it?

928
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,324
So you're trying the turker after the
Afro-chicken?

929
00:54:58,395 --> 00:55:00,260
What chicken?
Still a chick, after all.

930
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:01,354
Chick?

931
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:06,625
Let me introduce you to Mr. Siu.

932
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:17,375
Why does your perfume smell like petroleum?

933
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:23,585
You're that girl from the motor shop!

934
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:26,614
You've fixed my car before.

935
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:29,389
Really?
- Y...yes...

936
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:37,232
I never realized that you have such a nice figure
underyour usual work clothes.

937
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:38,598
Please mind your words.

938
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:41,601
Ifyou got the goods, don't be shy to show it.

939
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,136
She's really not bad at all.

940
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:47,600
What happened?

941
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:49,671
Would you like to have more, sir?

942
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:52,139
Why did you hit me?

943
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,013
Would you believe that I'd beat you up?

944
00:55:54,317 --> 00:55:56,251
Jim, you're drunk!

945
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,218
I've only drank a little bit.

946
00:55:58,254 --> 00:56:00,222
Yes, the fact that you drank bit by bit only
makes it worse.

947
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:01,280
Mr. Koo!

948
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:03,053
Mind your own business!

949
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:29,076
How lovely.

950
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:31,344
It's perfect for Philidonna and I.

951
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:34,181
You'll be mine in a minute.

952
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:42,054
Was I actually that rude?

953
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:47,664
Not really.  I think you're pretty charismatic.

954
00:56:50,273 --> 00:56:52,673
I've actually scared many of my boyfriends away
in the past.

955
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:57,505
But you're no match for me.
I'm a pretty good fighter.

956
00:56:57,981 --> 00:56:59,175
What's the use in being a good fighter?

957
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,978
Moustachio hates it when people tickle him.

958
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:03,011
No, not this moustachio!

959
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:04,610
Really?
Yes!

960
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:08,054
Stretch out your hands.  Stand still!
Don't move!  What are you doing?

961
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,422
I'm tickling you.

962
00:57:11,461 --> 00:57:13,486
Don't!
Just admit it!

963
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:14,554
How about you?

964
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:15,586
I'm not afraid.

965
00:57:15,665 --> 00:57:16,495
Aren't you?

966
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:18,160
I'm not!

967
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:19,395
Then, you'll have to let me give it a try!
Sure!

968
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,063
Don't move.
- Sure!

969
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,298
Here I come!

970
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:34,307
Stretch out your hands.

971
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,552
Are you really not afraid of it?

972
00:57:44,994 --> 00:57:46,291
Come closer.

973
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:48,259
Ears?

974
00:57:56,406 --> 00:57:58,203
Nose?

975
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:06,546
No.
- What is it?

976
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:08,141
My lips can't stand the itchiness.

977
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:11,244
Your moustache is making me itch.

978
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,581
One more time.

979
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:22,154
Don't laugh.
- Be gentle.

980
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:54,256
Why do you look elsewhere whenever
you kiss my sister?

981
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:57,198
You're not concentrating, master.

982
00:58:59,569 --> 00:59:01,594
Sorry...did I bother you?

983
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:04,471
Take your time with the kissing.  I'm leaving.

984
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:07,505
It's getting late.  I've got to go.

985
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:10,045
See you later.

986
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:11,478
Let's kiss a little more.

987
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:13,539
Feel free to come back for more visitational
kisses, master.

988
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:15,346
You little runt!

989
00:59:15,585 --> 00:59:17,485
Why did you come back for?

990
00:59:19,455 --> 00:59:21,218
I want to move back in.

991
00:59:21,257 --> 00:59:25,523
Ifyou're moving back, then just move back in.
You don't need to peek at us.

992
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:28,995
Since you're being so straight-forward,
don't say that I'm not taking care ofyou.

993
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,532
You should go and kiss him while you still can.

994
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,558
My master's leaving soon.

995
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:35,428
He'll be leaving you.

996
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:01,989
Come down, baby!  Come on!

997
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:05,034
What is it, mom?

998
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:07,393
I've promised to scrap out every TV set.

999
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,166
I won't have anyone to keep an eye on you again.

1000
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:10,000
Why?

1001
01:00:10,073 --> 01:00:12,701
You'll find out soon enough.  Look who's here!

1002
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:15,068
Hi!
- Cousin?

1003
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:17,403
Why brings you here?

1004
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:19,504
I've come to take you to England.

1005
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:22,483
I've asked your cousin to take you over to
England for your studies.

1006
01:00:22,518 --> 01:00:24,110
Why?

1007
01:00:24,153 --> 01:00:26,053
Don't you know that I can't watch overyou?

1008
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:27,420
Your cousin is a police officer in England.

1009
01:00:27,523 --> 01:00:29,047
If she can keep the criminals under control,

1010
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:30,582
then I'm sure that she can keep an eye on you.

1011
01:00:31,027 --> 01:00:33,018
Don't worry.  I'll take good care of her.

1012
01:00:33,062 --> 01:00:35,257
If I'm busy, I'll ask my brother to do it for me.

1013
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,562
After all, my brother is the deputy chiefof
a prison ward.

1014
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:41,161
Mom, I don't want to go!

1015
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:57,644
How dare you come back, you little bastard!

1016
01:00:58,054 --> 01:01:01,990
You!  You're not a man!
Bearing dirty thoughts on my girlfriend!

1017
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:07,291
I'm telling you right now that I'm moving back
with my sister.

1018
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,594
Don't say I'm not being generous enough.
I'm leaving this place over to you.

1019
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:11,395
Are you looking for another fight?

1020
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:19,269
Who are you looking for?
Are you Jacky Kam Chi-Kit?

1021
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:23,574
I am...this is bad...

1022
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,585
Don't hit me!  I'm very weak!

1023
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:36,147
I'll die ifyou beat me up!

1024
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:38,217
I'm coughing.  See?  I'm coughing badly here.

1025
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:40,024
Okay!

1026
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:49,465
I'm fine, man.

1027
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:54,408
I'm fine!  Beat me up!

1028
01:01:54,577 --> 01:02:00,482
Hit him!

1029
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:10,048
Hit him...
- Damn!

1030
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:16,430
Even though I'm completely wounded,

1031
01:02:16,499 --> 01:02:19,434
I was able to save my chastity.

1032
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,264
Kneel down!

1033
01:02:25,007 --> 01:02:29,137
I'll give you 7 days to pay me a total of $99,900
for medical fees.

1034
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:31,646
We'll remain brothers that way.  Otherwise...

1035
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:34,040
prepare to become a "sister".

1036
01:02:36,352 --> 01:02:38,252
Okay.

1037
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,123
Oww!
What's "oww"?

1038
01:02:46,229 --> 01:02:48,663
It hurts.  Therefore, it should be "ouch".

1039
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:51,360
You're supposed to look like you're in pain but
you can't convey it.

1040
01:02:59,375 --> 01:03:00,774
What happened?

1041
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:03,001
Bravo!  Bravo!

1042
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:05,013
Look at Jacky!
His expressions of pain look really convincing.

1043
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:09,143
Look at how his body and soul wince in extreme
pain.

1044
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:12,052
Fellow students, to become a good actor,

1045
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:15,613
you must forget all self-indulgence in order to
portray someone under extreme pain.

1046
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:19,094
Unless I tell him to stop, he will continue to
feel pain.

1047
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:22,161
Your make-up looks great.  Who taught you this?

1048
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:26,635
It looks so real!  Alright, get up!
It's over now.

1049
01:03:26,669 --> 01:03:29,763
Help...help me up!    -Alright, fellow students!
Let's continue our rehearsal!

1050
01:03:30,072 --> 01:03:33,701
Come and give me a hand!
See how convincingly painful he looks!

1051
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:36,371
I'm afraid you just don't have the talent.
Watch Jacky's performance!

1052
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:38,380
Jacky...where's Jacky?

1053
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:41,247
I'm right here!

1054
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:43,685
I'm really injured.

1055
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:45,687
Help him up first.  Let's take a look...

1056
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:46,688
Are you alright?

1057
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:48,383
No wonder your acting looked so real.

1058
01:03:48,424 --> 01:03:49,982
Did you go out for another brawI again, Jacky?

1059
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:50,991
BrawI?

1060
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:53,120
Why didn't you take us along with you?

1061
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:55,596
Bullshit!
- Just hang on!

1062
01:04:01,204 --> 01:04:05,140
At the current situation, I'll have to tell
the truth.

1063
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:09,975
I've just done something which I believe that
everyone should learn about.

1064
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:13,743
When I was on my way here,
I saw a one-year-old child.

1065
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:18,117
He suddenly ran to the road and the situation
was very critical.

1066
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:19,677
Guess what I did?

1067
01:04:19,722 --> 01:04:22,384
I couldn't care less and I simply jumped over.

1068
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:25,719
Why aren't you helping me up?
Give me a hand here!

1069
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:28,355
I can't tell whether or not you are telling
the truth.

1070
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:31,189
What happened afterwards?

1071
01:04:37,406 --> 01:04:39,431
I wasn't holding the child.

1072
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:43,442
Then...then, a truck was over there.

1073
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:47,377
No, it was a container truck coming towards me.

1074
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:51,375
So I rolled aside.

1075
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:52,409
Amazing...

1076
01:04:53,155 --> 01:04:55,089
So I rolled over to the other side.

1077
01:04:55,124 --> 01:04:57,149
Of course, the child was unharmed.

1078
01:04:57,193 --> 01:05:00,026
But I turned out looking like this.

1079
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:03,560
Get the rubbing alcohol.  Help him up!

1080
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:06,097
Be gentle...
- Be careful!

1081
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:09,728
How are you doing?

1082
01:05:09,772 --> 01:05:12,172
Here you go!
Come on...

1083
01:05:12,308 --> 01:05:13,798
Don't rub too much.

1084
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:17,237
Hey...don't scratch...

1085
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,474
Hey!  Come and help out!

1086
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:22,608
Let me do it.  This is how you do it.
You don't do it there.

1087
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:23,346
What do you know?

1088
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:25,144
Hey!  My injury...

1089
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:28,321
Stop shouting! It'll obviously hurt while rubbing
injuries. There's some bruise over there.

1090
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:30,291
How will you heal without rubbing it?

1091
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:32,487
Don't stop me.  Rub it down there.
Over there...

1092
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:37,498
Hey!  I'm fine now.  Help!  Mommy!

1093
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:40,099
Tell us the truth.

1094
01:05:40,202 --> 01:05:42,102
What made you like this?

1095
01:05:45,174 --> 01:05:48,541
Well, I heroically saved a child's life!

1096
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:52,012
Heroically?
Each ofyou get some rubbing alcohol for him!

1097
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:53,572
Fine...

1098
01:05:58,587 --> 01:06:01,522
Even if I said the truth, would everyone help me?

1099
01:06:01,557 --> 01:06:04,219
Of course, we will!  We've just helped you even
when you're in this kind of mess.

1100
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:07,286
Sure!  We'll definitely help you!
Yeah!  We will!

1101
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:15,361
Fine!  I'll tell you guys the truth.

1102
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:22,310
I've gotten into a mess with the triads.

1103
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:26,005
But I resisted for the sake ofjustice.

1104
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:29,074
And as a result, they did this to me.

1105
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:32,019
They've even given me a week's time to

1106
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:38,049
gather $99,999 dollars and
have it handed over to them.

1107
01:06:38,227 --> 01:06:41,162
Otherwise, they'll kick my ass again.

1108
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:44,057
I'm sure that everyone who's living for the sake
ofjustice

1109
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:46,392
will gather the money in order to help me.

1110
01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:49,370
I...

1111
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:55,506
I know you'll all vanish right away.

1112
01:07:00,116 --> 01:07:01,310
After you finish covering the hole,

1113
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:04,251
just change the metal door into a wooden one
for me.

1114
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:07,255
Jacky, you're back!

1115
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:09,717
Hey, what happened to you?

1116
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:12,990
How did this happen to you?

1117
01:07:13,996 --> 01:07:16,191
I rolled under a container truck after it
ran over me

1118
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:18,700
as I was saving the life of a small child.

1119
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:22,670
Liar!  Trying to deceive me again!
Better tell me the truth!

1120
01:07:23,272 --> 01:07:24,796
Phone call!

1121
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:27,202
Just stay here and stand still!

1122
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:31,239
Hello.

1123
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,078
What happened to you, Jacky?

1124
01:07:39,188 --> 01:07:40,519
Why do you look like this?

1125
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:42,251
What are you doing?

1126
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:45,587
So much luggage.
Okay...I'll be back right away.

1127
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:47,789
Mom's forcing me to go to England with my cousin.

1128
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:49,328
I don't want to go.
That's why I came to see you.

1129
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:51,798
I'll live here.  I won't leave.

1130
01:07:53,669 --> 01:07:56,137
What are you two up to?

1131
01:07:56,205 --> 01:07:57,672
I'm in a hurry to get to work.

1132
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,666
I'll settle the score with you later.

1133
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:04,645
Sis, I need some money...

1134
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,171
You runt, money is the only thing you ask for.
No way!

1135
01:08:07,216 --> 01:08:09,582
No!  It's urgent!

1136
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:13,986
Urgent?  You never have anything good for me,
you runt!

1137
01:08:14,056 --> 01:08:15,785
Here's $200.  $100 for each.

1138
01:08:15,991 --> 01:08:18,118
That's it.  Now behave!

1139
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:21,561
No, sis!

1140
01:08:29,371 --> 01:08:32,738
Hey!  Do you know I'm in a lot of trouble
this time?

1141
01:08:32,808 --> 01:08:34,605
I can't pull myselftogether.

1142
01:08:35,644 --> 01:08:37,043
Don't you want me anymore?

1143
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:39,547
Then I'll...

1144
01:08:39,582 --> 01:08:40,344
Fine, I'll leave!

1145
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:43,382
Hey...come and visit when you've got the time!

1146
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:45,544
Why don't you make me stay?

1147
01:08:46,088 --> 01:08:48,056
Then stay for a while and leave later.

1148
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:50,058
Are you really not going to make me stay?

1149
01:08:50,259 --> 01:08:52,420
It's obvious to me that you won't leave.
Why should I make you stay?

1150
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:55,362
You're so incorrigible!

1151
01:09:00,035 --> 01:09:03,232
You still hit me while I'm injured.
Don't you love me anymore?

1152
01:09:03,272 --> 01:09:05,399
Don't you love me?

1153
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:08,671
I know you still do.

1154
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:17,479
Auntie.
- You little runt!

1155
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,317
Where did you kidnap my baby?

1156
01:09:19,355 --> 01:09:20,515
Don't scold people at random!

1157
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:22,114
Not only am I scolding you, I'm also going to
hurt you.

1158
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:25,127
Tell me where did my baby go?  Tell me now!

1159
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:27,129
That's enough, you two!

1160
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,289
I have to let you beat me after getting hurt by
your daughter.

1161
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:31,094
So what?  You'd better tell me where my baby
has gone.

1162
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:34,296
I was going to give you a call just to
tell you about your daughter's whereabouts.

1163
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:36,031
But I don't want to tell you now.

1164
01:09:36,405 --> 01:09:38,430
Forget it...sorry...consider this my apology
to you.

1165
01:09:38,474 --> 01:09:40,999
Can you please tell me about my baby's
whereabouts?

1166
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:44,544
Your daughter's packed everything and said
she wanted to run away with me.

1167
01:09:44,713 --> 01:09:45,771
But I didn't agree with her.

1168
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:48,381
But ifyou continue to treat her like a prisoner,

1169
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:50,476
sooner or later, she'd run away with another and
it'll be too late foryou to regret it.

1170
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:52,282
I understand...I won't treat her like that
anymore.

1171
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:55,256
Can you please tell me where my baby has gone?

1172
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:58,556
I'm not running away with her.
Where else can she go?  Look over there!

1173
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:04,355
Baby...

1174
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,391
Chuen, come over here and grab the lady's
luggage.

1175
01:10:06,435 --> 01:10:08,562
Baby, just tell me ifyou're unhappy about
anything.

1176
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:09,764
You don't have to run away.

1177
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:12,205
Mommy won't treat you like a prisoner anymore.

1178
01:10:12,241 --> 01:10:15,039
Mom, I won't go to England with my cousin.

1179
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:16,510
That's right.  Consider it granted.

1180
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:20,106
Come...let's go home together.  Get in the car.

1181
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:27,011
Come!  What is it now?
You still can't let go of that rascal?

1182
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:30,719
He's not a rascal, Mom.
He persuaded me to go home.

1183
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,392
Mom, Jacky's in trouble.

1184
01:10:33,429 --> 01:10:36,159
He owes a debt of $100,000.

1185
01:10:36,498 --> 01:10:41,197
Don't run, Jacky!  Where are you going?

1186
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:42,397
I told you not to ask your motherfor a loan.

1187
01:10:42,438 --> 01:10:44,201
Why are you in need of so much money?

1188
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,229
He's been blackmailed.

1189
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:46,434
Say no more.

1190
01:10:46,475 --> 01:10:48,739
Forget it.
I'm the one who've met the wrong people.

1191
01:10:48,777 --> 01:10:50,210
Jacky, don't go!

1192
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:51,338
I'll follow you wherever you go.

1193
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:53,074
I can lend him money.

1194
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:55,280
But he won't be able to repay you in a short
period of time.

1195
01:10:55,317 --> 01:10:57,751
He just got fired at the garage.

1196
01:10:57,786 --> 01:11:00,152
So, are you asking me for the money or
do you want me to lend it to you?

1197
01:11:00,189 --> 01:11:01,747
It's just the same.

1198
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:10,559
Mr. Koo's flight has been confirmed.

1199
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:12,726
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1200
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:20,566
Here's your ticket.

1201
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:24,440
What?  Don't you want to leave?  Just stay here!

1202
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,175
Hong Kong's not too shabby.

1203
01:11:27,182 --> 01:11:29,150
Let's go!

1204
01:11:42,164 --> 01:11:43,222
Master.

1205
01:11:43,265 --> 01:11:44,254
Why are you guys here?

1206
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,061
My mother established this bakery shop.

1207
01:11:46,101 --> 01:11:49,036
Jacky, I thought you worked at the garage.
Did you switch your occupation?

1208
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:51,665
No!  Her mother has forcibly given me the
new name of"Gimcrack".

1209
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:54,073
She told me to switch to bakery.

1210
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:56,404
Try it.

1211
01:11:56,445 --> 01:11:57,605
Alright.

1212
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:03,008
It seems to taste like petroleum.

1213
01:12:03,585 --> 01:12:04,677
Yeah.

1214
01:12:22,604 --> 01:12:25,505
Bravo, master...

1215
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:01,147
I can give you a ride.

1216
01:16:01,256 --> 01:16:03,588
No thanks, auntie.  I can take the bus.

1217
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:05,058
Goodbye.
- Bye!

1218
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,388
Get in the car, baby.  Come on!

1219
01:16:06,428 --> 01:16:09,397
I want to take the bus with Jacky, Mom.

1220
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:12,025
Alright but you've got to come back earlier.

1221
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:12,795
Bye, mom!

1222
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:14,363
Goodbye!
- Bye!

1223
01:16:15,637 --> 01:16:19,630
Wait for me, Jacky!  I'll take the bus with you.

1224
01:16:20,442 --> 01:16:22,569
Why take the bus when you've got a Rolls Royce?

1225
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:25,136
Tell me which is more expensive.
A bus or the Rolls Royce?

1226
01:16:25,981 --> 01:16:28,279
The bus is expensive.  No need to ask.

1227
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:31,613
Why don't we find some friends and study the
Buddha's Palm and Jaded Maiden Sword Stance?

1228
01:16:31,653 --> 01:16:33,484
But Mom told me to come home earlier.

1229
01:16:33,522 --> 01:16:34,648
I'll send you home after studying it for a while.

1230
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:37,049
Alright.  But don't run so fast.

1231
01:16:37,092 --> 01:16:39,390
Hurry up!  We're running out of time!

1232
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:42,063
Go home!

1233
01:16:44,366 --> 01:16:46,596
Excuse us...your questions will be answered
shortly.

1234
01:16:46,635 --> 01:16:50,503
Please excuse us, everyone.

1235
01:16:50,572 --> 01:16:53,063
Your questions will be answered shortly.

1236
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:54,473
Watch out!
Please excuse us.

1237
01:16:54,509 --> 01:16:56,272
Your questions will be answered shortly.

1238
01:16:56,311 --> 01:16:58,279
Please excuse us.

1239
01:16:58,313 --> 01:17:02,374
There will be a press conference soon.
Please make way.

1240
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:10,455
Thanks.

1241
01:17:19,001 --> 01:17:22,698
Thanks...fellow members of the press...

1242
01:17:22,771 --> 01:17:25,797
We've got a farewell party on the 3rd floor
ofthis hotel.

1243
01:17:26,008 --> 01:17:27,635
Please don't interfere while Mr. Koo is getting
a change of new clothes.

1244
01:17:27,676 --> 01:17:29,234
Many guests have already arrived.

1245
01:17:29,277 --> 01:17:31,006
Please hold your questions for later.

1246
01:17:31,046 --> 01:17:33,378
Thanks...

1247
01:17:33,548 --> 01:17:39,316
Please excuse us...thanks...

1248
01:17:39,421 --> 01:17:41,389
Excuse me.  I'm looking for Mr. Koo.

1249
01:17:41,423 --> 01:17:45,052
Sorry, miss. Mr. Koo doesn't want to see anyone
at the present moment.

1250
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:47,556
Thanks.

1251
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:57,595
Yes, Carrie's here.

1252
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:01,205
Mr. Koo!

1253
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:03,267
Have you seen a long-haired girl that was
looking for me?

1254
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:05,404
Yes, but she has already left.

1255
01:18:07,215 --> 01:18:08,477
What do you want?

1256
01:18:18,126 --> 01:18:20,253
Carrie.

1257
01:18:31,306 --> 01:18:32,773
Your concert was a success.

1258
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:35,600
Thanks.

1259
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:41,179
Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1260
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:43,150
Where has Mr. Koo gone to?

1261
01:18:43,452 --> 01:18:46,478
He has personal affairs to deal with.  He'll be
here once they're dealt with.     -Alright.

1262
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:49,388
Please help yourselves!
Okay...

1263
01:18:49,424 --> 01:18:50,789
Cheers, everyone!

1264
01:18:54,496 --> 01:18:58,057
What are you looking at?  He's leaving tomorrow.

1265
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:29,160
Here we are!

1266
01:19:29,364 --> 01:19:30,353
I'll ring the bell.

1267
01:19:30,398 --> 01:19:32,389
You're blind.  How can you ring the bell?

1268
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:34,368
Open up, Chopsticks!
Chopsticks!

1269
01:19:34,402 --> 01:19:37,303
It's us.
Hurry up, Chopsticks!

1270
01:19:37,405 --> 01:19:38,770
The champagne tastes great!  Hey!

1271
01:19:38,807 --> 01:19:40,798
Open up, Chopsticks!

1272
01:19:41,042 --> 01:19:42,771
We've bought champagne to bid yourfarewell.
We'll wait foryou!

1273
01:19:43,011 --> 01:19:45,309
Dear brothers, sisters and classmates.

1274
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:46,608
We'd better not disturb him right now.

1275
01:19:46,648 --> 01:19:48,616
He's handling on something very important
right now.

1276
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:50,514
What could so important?
Yeah!

1277
01:19:50,585 --> 01:19:51,984
Love!

1278
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:53,544
Chopsticks...
- Open up!

1279
01:19:53,588 --> 01:19:55,522
Please do him a favor.

1280
01:19:55,557 --> 01:19:57,081
We are trying to help him!
Yeah!

1281
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:58,717
How can you help him in this kind of situation?

1282
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:01,354
Do not disturb.  That's enough.  Let's go!
Go?

1283
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:03,157
We haven't even seen him in the last 10 years.
Exactly!  Is that all there is to it?

1284
01:20:03,265 --> 01:20:04,357
It'll be fast.  He'll be back very soon.

1285
01:20:04,432 --> 01:20:06,332
I'm blind.  I can't see anything.
I could help...

1286
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:09,436
Go!  Good riddance!

1287
01:20:47,108 --> 01:20:51,306
I'll come back to Hong Kong for another concert
next March.

1288
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:53,514
That's good.

1289
01:20:54,382 --> 01:20:56,976
I've got a year to train myself not to fall
asleep during concerts.

1290
01:20:59,287 --> 01:21:01,448
Mr. Koo, your luggage is now in the car.

1291
01:21:01,489 --> 01:21:03,252
It's time to go to the airport.

1292
01:21:03,425 --> 01:21:05,120
Thanks.

1293
01:21:06,294 --> 01:21:07,989
You may go first.

1294
01:21:08,029 --> 01:21:09,462
Let me give you a ride back.

1295
01:21:09,598 --> 01:21:14,058
It's okay.
You'll still have to go after sending me away.

1296
01:21:14,236 --> 01:21:16,397
I'd like to stay a little longer.

1297
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:02,148
Quit dilly-dallying!  You'll still have to go.

1298
01:22:02,183 --> 01:22:03,377
The plane won't wait.

1299
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:04,544
Take your sword back.

1300
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:06,486
"Swipe the sword ofwisdom to cut the romance."

1301
01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:10,287
You don't want to be like Chewing Gum and
remain stuck, do you?

1302
01:22:43,325 --> 01:22:44,189
Who are you looking for?

1303
01:22:44,259 --> 01:22:45,157
Is this Ms. Kam?

1304
01:22:45,193 --> 01:22:46,057
Yes, I am.

1305
01:22:46,094 --> 01:22:48,028
Mr. Koo has sent me to deliver your package.

1306
01:22:50,265 --> 01:22:52,563
Please sign here.

1307
01:23:24,432 --> 01:23:27,265
Sis...
- What?

1308
01:23:27,302 --> 01:23:29,634
This time, I've got something good for you.

1309
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:31,434
Something good?  What could it be?

1310
01:23:31,473 --> 01:23:33,134
Come!

1311
01:23:33,174 --> 01:23:34,198
What is it?

1312
01:23:34,275 --> 01:23:35,401
I'm your brother.
I won't play practical jokes on you.

1313
01:23:35,443 --> 01:23:38,571
Come on!

1314
01:23:39,347 --> 01:23:41,281
I've really got something good foryou.
Come here!

1315
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:24,390
Go on!

1316
01:24:27,295 --> 01:24:29,593
Propose.  What are you waiting for?  Come on!

1317
01:24:30,331 --> 01:24:33,300
Someone wants you despite your temper.
Just put it on!

1318
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:35,598
What?
Do I really have to marry him?

1319
01:24:35,637 --> 01:24:37,298
Don't you want it?  I do!

1320
01:24:37,338 --> 01:24:39,101
No way!

1321
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:41,675
I knew you'd be like this.

1322
01:24:45,046 --> 01:24:46,377
Bravo!
