3
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,881
我天
Fuck me.

4
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,250
真不敢相信我會死在這種地方
I can't believe I'm going to die in this place.

5
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,922
但在這麼遙遠的地方 我就能幹更多壞事
But, as far as headstones go, a man could do a lot worse.

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,364
我叫查理沃爾夫
I'm Charlie Wolfe.

7
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,128
當你躺在這裏 等待死亡的降臨
And as I lie here, waiting for death's cold embrace,

8
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,886
我不禁問自己
I find myself asking the question,

9
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,169
事情怎麼會變成這樣
"How the fuck did it come to this?"

10
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,284
我才不會死 我要活得更好
I don't die. I thrive.

11
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,645
該死
Fuck.

12
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,211
該死
Fuck!

13
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,884

Yeah? Yeah.

14
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,989

I'm... I'm sorry. Could you hang on one second?

15
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,395

I'm actually in a lot of pain.

21
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,521

Sure. I think we can fit you in.

22
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,085

Change of plans. She's coming today.

32
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,366
我還沒準備好
I'm not ready.

33
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,567
那沒辦法
We've got no choice.

34
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,049
把我的牙科病歷換上 把我的車開到沙地去
Switch my dental records and let's get my car to the quarry.

35
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,200

40

-怎麼回事  -我撞到門了
- What happened? - Oh, I hit the door.

41
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,085
真可憐
Oh, you poor thing!

42
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,282

48
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,161
我應該不用…
I think I...

49
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,448
躺好 張嘴
Now, lie back... and open.

50
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,768
可真磨磨蹭蹭 解決了嗎
Took you long enough. Is she out?

51
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,121
沒動靜了
Cold.

52
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,210

55
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,601
什麼都要我操心嗎
Must I think of everything?

56
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,085
路上有加油站
There's a garage on the way.

57
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,164
快點 我等你
Don't take forever. I'll be waiting.

58
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,402
接下來是第五個報道 黑人聚居區…
Ready to go in the fifth event, Blacktown...

59
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,364
西爾弗出現了…
Silver Tsar's coming up...

60
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,603
西爾弗被帶到比賽場地
Here's Silver Tsar taking to the outside

61
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,001
歷經磨練的幸運兒點亮了賽場
and the well-tried favorite lights up.

62
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,401
西爾弗的對手是黑人區的小伙子Lad和Daytone
It's Silver Tsar racing the Blacktown Lad and Daytone.

63
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,891
-他佔據了領先地位  -快上
- He's taken over the running. - Get up!

64
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,724
這位幸運兒當前形勢十分樂觀
And the favorite's looking really good at the moment.

65
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,211
他甩開了對手
He raced two lengths in front of...

66
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,649
別這樣 別這樣 拜託 別這樣
Not now, not now. Please, not now.

67
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,727
西爾弗暫時佔據領先地位 但他看起來很疲憊
Silver Tsar has the lead but he's getting tired.

68
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,087
Daytone出現在身後 麥迪遜羅斯也追上來了
Daytone's coming back and so is Madison Rose.

69
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,029
噢 出現轉機了 幸運兒被超過了
Oh, there's a fall! The favorite's down!

70
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,890
-該死  -西爾弗落在了後面
- Shit! - Silver Tsar's fallen.

71
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,280
-真不敢相信  -媽的
- You wouldn't believe it. - Shit!

72
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,564
-媽的 媽的 -勝利就在眼前 他卻沒有把握住...
- Shit, shit, shit! - Victory in his sights and he's down...

73
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,648
只剩最後50米 他沒有創造奇跡
...wonder of the world, and down he went with only 50m to go.

74
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,565
世事難料 這就是比賽
Que sera. That's racing, I guess.

75
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,564
可惜的是丟了錢的投注者
It's bad luck for the punters that they lose their money.

76
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,889
媽的
Fucking hell!

77
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,041
該死

你還在計劃離開嗎
You still planning on leaving?

85
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,169
我可不只是計劃
I'm way beyond planning.

86
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,728

Something like that.

117
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,641
汽油啊
It's the petrol.

144
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,971
-傑克 我們談談  -現在不行
- Jack, we need to talk. - Not now.

145
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,411
你的婚姻是一場玩笑
Your marriage is a joke.

146
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,285
她已經完全放棄你了
She's given up on your whole pathetic act.

147
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,765
你知道你是…
Do you know that you're the la...

148
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,411
夠了
Enough.

149
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,763
你怎麼不跟你游手好閒的老公
Why don't you and your deadbeat husband

150
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,763
好好管理你們的生意
mind your own fucking business?

151
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,689
傑克 你是我哥
Jack, you're my brother.

152
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,446
我不能袖手旁觀
I can't just stand by and watch this happen.

153
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,965
說完了了嗎
Are you done?

154
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,770
你打電話了嗎
Have you made that call?

155
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,081
雇用他 跟蹤她
Hire him and have her followed.

156
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,089
如果不是 我就什麼都不管了
If I'm wrong, then I won't say another word.

157
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,922
傑克 我們需要進一點特基拉酒
Jack, we need to get more tequi...

158
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,530
你什麼時候有槍的
When did you get a gun?

159
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,851
發生了什麼事
Is everything okay?

160
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,286
坐下
Sit down.

161
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:54,811
端起來
Pick it up.

162
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,331
把槍放下
Please put the gun down.

163
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,130
我叫你端起來
I said pick it fucking up.

164
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,088
你知道我有多愛你嗎
Do you have any idea how much I love you?

165
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,410
你不愛我
You don't love me.

166
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,244
你只想控制我
You just want to control me.

167
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,491
愛麗絲
Alice.

168
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,409
你在跟別人約會嗎
Are you seeing someone else?

169
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,362
這種事我沒辦法解決
'Cause I couldn't handle something like that.

170
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,084
我只能看你死
I'd sooner see you dead.

171
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,291
我要走了
I need to go.

172
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,223
喂?
Yeah.

173
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,525
不好意思 你等會
Sorry, just hold on a sec.

174
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,970
好的 我一小時後到那
Yeah, I'll be there in an hour.

175
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,647
-你在幹嘛  -傑克 你弄疼我了
- What are you doing? - Jack, you're hurting me.

176
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,930
你偷偷摸摸地幹嘛
What are you fucking doing sneaking around?

177
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,286
我沒有偷偷摸摸
I wasn't sneaking around.

178
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,484
這是你最後一次打我了
That's the last time you hit me.

179
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,284
愛麗絲 我錯了
Alice, I'm sorry!

180
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,530
你牙齒碎了
Yeah, your tooth is chipped.

181
00:31:07,105 --> 00:31:08,646
我只有這些
Sorry, it's all I've got.

182
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,731
謝謝
Thank you.

183
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,288
你一個人可以嗎
You'll be okay on your own for a few?

184
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,006
怎麼了 你要去哪
Why? Where are you going?

185
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,405
我要去拜訪一下傑克
I'm gonna pay Jack a visit.

186
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,131
迪倫... 迪倫
Dylan... Dylan.

187
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,526
迪倫
Dylan!

188
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,685
過來
Come here.

189
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,260
別走
Stay with me.

190
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,283
有些人要受點教訓
Somebody needs to sort that prick out.

191
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,210
別走
Stay with me.

192
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,851
求你
Please?

193
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,800
拜託
Please.

194
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,402
傑克不會經常這樣
Jack wasn't always like this.

195
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,688
別給他找借口
Doesn't excuse what he does.

196
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,809
你知道他之前跟我說什麼嗎
You know what he told me earlier?

197
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,443
如果我跟別的男人在一起他就要我死
That he'd sooner see me dead than with another guy.

198
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,170
他真的這麼說了嗎
He actually said that?

199
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,569
最恐怖的是...
The scariest part...

200
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,961
說話的時候他拿槍指著我
...is that he was pointing this at me when he said that.

201
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,200
操他媽的
Fucking hell.

202
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,644
還好我們明天要離開了
Good thing we're leaving tomorrow.

203
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,170
你確定你要走嗎
You sure you want to go?

204
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,768
當然了
Of course I'm sure.

205
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,327
但是你還沒有賣掉你的加油站
But you haven't sold the garage yet.

206
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,845
看來時間很緊迫
Things will be tight.

207
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,326
錢是個大問題
Money's always a problem when you don't have much.

208
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,722
我會找工作掙錢
I'll get a job.

209
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,562
我們可以掙很多錢
We can make enough for the both of us.

210
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,681
我可以幫你安排一下時間
Sure. I think we can fit you in.

211
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,760
兩點怎麼樣？
How's 2:00?

212
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,331
好的 兩點見
Perfect. I'll see you at 2:00.

213
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,811
好的 等會見
Alright. See you later.

214
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,001
南森
Nathan!

215
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,725
你酒醒了嗎
Are you sober?

216
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,046
差不多
Mostly.

217
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,606
對不起 愛麗絲
I'm sorry, Alice.

218
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,091
你總是說對不起
You're always sorry.

219
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,367
-喂  -我是查理沃爾夫
- Yeah. - This is Charlie Wolfe.

220
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,567
稍等
Hang on.

221
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,529
喂 把門關上
Oi. Shut the door?

222
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,446
說
Yeah.

223
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,568
有些東西你可以看看
I have something you might want to see.

224
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,085
好
Okay.

225
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,526
我過去嗎
Should I drop in?

226
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,920
不用
No.

227
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,167
知道岩石那邊的停車場嗎
You know the car park by Merchant Rock?

228
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,845
我一小時後到
I'll be there in an hour.

229
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,604
嗨 布魯斯
Hey, Bruce.

230
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,805
傑克在哪
Where's Jack?

231
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,450
在他辦公室
In his office.

232
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,530
你一定累了吧
You must be tired.

233
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,284
是 有點
Yeah, a little.

234
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,522
在小鎮兩頭跑
Running around town the way you do.

235
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,409
日夜兼程的
All hours of the day and night.

236
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,931
什麼
Excuse me?

237
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,649
-布魯斯  -傑克
- Bruce. - Jack. The very man.

238
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,081
我正在品嚐你的威士忌
Just checking on that case of whisky you promised.

239
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,322
過一會找你行嗎 我正要出門
Is later alright, mate? I'm just heading out.

240
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:31,008
好啊 別太久就行
Yeah. Long as it's not too much later.

241
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,605
對吧
Right?

242
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,844
給我你的車鑰匙
Give us your car keys.

243
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,081
你車子怎麼了
What's wrong with your car?

244
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,770
還在修理廠
It's still at the paint shop.

245
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,090
會很久嗎
Will you be long?

246
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,050
不確定
As long as it takes.

247
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,323
我兩點鐘要去見牙醫
I have an appointment with Nathan at 2:00.

248
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,965
該死
Fuck.

249
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,646
媽的
Shit.

250
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,725
沃爾夫
Wolfe!

251
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,369
沒想到這麼快就能接到你的電話
I didn't expect your call so soon.

252
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,602
是對手太鬆懈
Sometimes they make it too easy.

253
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,560
這是昨晚的
This was last night?

254
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,165
我天
Jesus.

255
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,520
給我帶什麼了嗎
Do you have something for me?

256
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,366
這個給我
I'm keeping this.

257
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,006
拿去吧
Be my guest.

258
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,650
就是為你準備的
I bought it just for you.

259
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,763
你打算呆幾天
You feel like staying on for a few days?

260
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,284
在這呆著沒意思
No sense hanging around.

261
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,602
有你感興趣的東西
I've got something for you, if you're interested.

262
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,761
你說
I'm listening.

263
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,410
五萬美金怎麼樣
How does 50 grand sound?

264
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,444
是筆大買賣
Like a dirty job.

265
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,644
你繼續說
And I'm still listening.

266
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,369
殺了我妻子
I want you to kill my wife.

267
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,568
讓這賤人消失
Make the bitch disappear.

268
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,730
傑克 你會把事情變得很麻煩
Jack, you've worked yourself into a knot over this thing.

269
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,006
沒關係
Fine.

270
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,401
你現在還不夠冷靜
You're reacting badly to some bad news.

271
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,001
-慢慢考慮  -我想清楚了
- Just take some time. - My mind is clear.

272
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,085
這可是一條不歸路 明白嗎
What you're talking about is a one-way street. You understand?

273
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,164
可沒有回頭的機會了
Once you start, there is no going back.

274
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,363
我已經警告過她了
She's had fair warning.

275
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,527
她明知故犯
She knew the consequences and she did it anyway.

276
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,086
所以殺了她
So fuck her.

277
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,165
你不想要錢嗎
You want my money or not?

278
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:56,242
你有現金嗎
Do you have that sort of cash just lying around?

279
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,606
有很多
It's covered.

280
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,490
我是說私房錢 這工作可沒有什麼收據
I mean untraceable. This kind of job doesn't come with a receipt.

281
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,045
都已經準備好了
I told you, it's covered.

282
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,567
這是信任的問題
There is, of course, the issue of trust.

283
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,801
我相信你
I trust you.

284
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,081
我知道 但是我怎麼確定
Yes, but how can I be sure

285
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,964
你不會耍我呢
you're not gonna go soft on me, Jack?

286
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,969
我們要相信彼此
Well, we'll have to trust each other.

287
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,202
你和你妻子信任彼此嗎
Did you and your wife ever trust each other?

288
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,769
你不想接著單 好吧 忘了我說過什麼
You don't want the job? Fine. Forget I asked.

289
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,644
我可沒不答應
I don't remember saying no.

290
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,370
那你就是答應了
So are you saying yes?

291
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,485
好吧 我干
Alright, I'll do it.

292
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,209
但是5萬不夠
But not for 50 grand.

293
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,051
你要多少
How much?

294
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,611
我要的價格比這高一倍
My rate's an even one.

295
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,086
6萬嗎
Sixty?

296
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,561
不 10萬
No, 100.

297
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,723
我可是專業的
I'm what you call a professional.

298
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,609
實力可是要花錢的
Quality always costs.

299
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,970
可以嗎
So are we on?

300
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,847
她兩點要去看牙醫
She has a dental appointment at 2:00.

301
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,161
不要讓我看到她回家
I'd be fine with her never coming home.

302
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,571
好的 你要做的就是
Alright, here's what I want you to do.

303
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,486
回店裏呆著 在一目瞭然的地方
Go back to the bar, and stay there, in plain sight.

304
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,847
笑迎所有人 不要表現得太反常
Smile for everyone, and don't act funny.

305
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,365
完事後我會聯繫你的
I'll contact you when it's done.

306
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,563
等你電話
I'll be expecting your call.

307
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,325
傑克
Oh, Jack?

308
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,604
保持通話流暢
Don't go putting that online, now, will you?

309
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,645
露西
Lucy.

310
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,285
我做不了
I can't go through with it.

311
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,325
為什麼
Can't?

312
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,206
該死
Shit.

313
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,005
盡量讓他滿意
Whatever he wants, get rid of him.

314
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,326
我來解決
I'll handle it.

315
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,882
布魯斯 你好嗎？
G'day, Bruce. How are you going?

316
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,050
我昨晚解決了個大事情 碰見了一個我們都認識的出版商
I was up the big smoke last night. Met a bookmaker we all know.

317
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,369
-誰  -伊凡布萊克
- Who's that? - Evan Black.

318
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,126
-你認識伊凡嗎  -是我一個親戚
- You know Evan? - He's a relative.

319
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,485
是嗎
I had no idea.

320
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,329
你知道
You know how it is around here.

321
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,164
我們總是和一些人有千絲萬縷的聯繫
We're all related one way or another.

322
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,927
是呀 世界真小
Yeah. Small world.

323
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,969
伊凡說你在躲他
Evan says you've been avoiding him.

324
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,921
說你欠他一筆錢
Says you owe him heaps of money,

325
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,724
到現在還沒有還錢的意思
and so far you haven't made good on a single marker.

326
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,089
聽著 我會還錢的
Look, it's okay. I am gonna pay him.

327
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,208
-我承諾過他了  -承諾頂屁用
- I gave him my word. - Fuck your word.

328
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,286
他只想要錢
He wants his money.

329
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,569
我會還錢的 我發誓
And he will get it, on my oath.

330
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,289
你不尊重他
You disrespected him.

331
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,648
他找了一個打手
He arranged for the lads to come see you.

332
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,370
但是我勸住他了
But I talked him out of it.

333
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,689
我先來見你
I said I'd come see you first.

334
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,361
我答應他先拿走你的東西
Promised him I'd collect everything you owe.

335
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,660
這一周內
Within the week.

336
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:43,411
如果解決不了... 我就殺了你
Failing that... I'd kill you meself.

337
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,008
布魯斯 我們有錢
Bruce... we're good for the money.

338
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,481
我們快要有錢了
Well, we will be.

339
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,242
你再給我一點時間
I just need a little bit more time.

340
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,286
多久
How much time?

341
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,720
兩個月
Couple of months.

342
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,082
-你在跟我開玩笑麼  -不
- You're taking the piss. - No.

343
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,843
短短幾個月怎麼拿到那麼多錢
Where's this money coming from in a few months?

344
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,804
我不能說 但是我發誓
I can't tell you, but it is real, okay? I promise.

345
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,088
別他媽跟我廢話
Don't come the raw fuckin' prawn.

346
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,730
你只有一個星期時間
You've got one week.

347
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,167
這可是25萬啊
We're talking about near 250 grand.

348
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,049
那是以前
That was before.

349
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,884
-什麼以前  -在我之前
- Before what? - Me.

350
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,641
現在是多少
How much now?

351
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,410
現在?
Now?

352
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,965
利滾利之後大概30萬 可以這麼說
Now we're talking about a figure so close to $300,000 we may as well call it that.

353
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,043
我沒說算利息啊 你瘋了嗎
No, we never agreed to that. Are you insane?

354
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,089
-沒有商量的餘地 -你別跟我開玩笑了
- Non-negotiable. - You can't be serious.

355
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,607
我可是很嚴肅的 過來
Let me show you how serious I am. Come here.

356
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,046
不 不用了
Nah, it's alright.

357
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,487
-布魯斯 別這樣  -別讓我說兩次
- Bruce, please. - Don't have me ask twice.

358
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,768
布魯斯 布魯斯
Bruce! Bruce!

359
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,040
你只有一個星期
You've got one week.

360
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,481
回答我
Now, say it.

361
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,930
布魯斯 住手
Bruce, stop.

362
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,764
你覺得他聽懂了嗎
You think he got the message?

363
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,602
-嗯  -聽懂了
- Well? - Yes.

364
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,007
布魯斯 我知道了 給我一個星期的時間
Bruce, we get it, okay? We've got a week.

365
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,491
不然呢
Or else?

366
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,209
我在問你
I'm asking you.

367
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,006
不然…
Or...

368
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,764
你會殺了我們
You'll kill us.

369
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,085
一個星期之內準備好錢
Have the money in a week.

370
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,160
露西 對不起
Lucy, I'm sorry.

371
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,606
別碰我
Don't touch me!

372
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,724
你只是站在那
You just stood there.

373
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,647
我不知道事情會變成這樣
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.

374
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,084
繼續說說這件事
We go ahead with it.

375
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,966
我們需要那筆保險金
We need that insurance money more than ever now.

376
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,321
好
Okay.

377
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,410
你去哪了 我要遲到了
Where have you been? I'm late.

378
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,005
兜了個風
Went for a drive.

379
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,286
我車鑰匙呢
My car keys?

380
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,650
再見 愛麗絲
Goodbye, Alice.

381
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,404
哦 我的天
Oh, my God!

382
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,609
媽的 不
Shit! No!

383
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,164
你覺得他們的房子怎麼樣
How do you like their house?

384
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,963
你確定他們在國外嗎
Are you certain they're overseas?

385
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,690
要待六個月
For the next six months.

386
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,882
你知道密碼嗎
You do know the code, don't you?

387
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,527
馬克斯告訴我一個簡單好記的方法
Max told me there was an easy way to remember it.

388
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,404
是嗎
Obviously.

389
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,970
貝多芬
Beethoven.

390
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,690
-什麼  -密碼
- What? - The code.

391
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,770
1812 1812序曲
It's 1812, after the overture.

392
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,840
那可是柴可夫斯基寫的 傻逼
That's Tchaikovsky, you idiot.

393
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,761
該死
Shit.

394
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,366
露西 你有誰的聯繫方式嗎
Lucy, have you got any of my contacts here?

395
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,566
有
Yeah.

396
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,369
在我化妝包裏 找到了
In my toiletry bag. I'll get it.

397
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,371
那是什麼
What's that?

398
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,688
我打算告訴你的
I was gonna tell you about it.

399
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,401
剛才等你的時候在她車上找到的
I found it in her car when I was waiting for you earlier.

400
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,643
之前的事情搞得我忘了
It just slipped my mind with all that was going on.

401
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,211
有多少錢
How much?

402
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,206
大概25萬
About...$250,000.

403
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,369
一百萬的四分之一
Quarter of a million dollars.

404
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,770
你把這錢忘記了
And you just forgot about it?

405
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,203
我們沒必要殺了她
We didn't have to kill her, did we?

406
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:23,486
你在說什麼
What are you talking about?!

407
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,880
我們可以用這些錢還布魯斯
We could have used that money to pay Bruce.

408
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,771
在我找到之前 我們還欠了一大筆債
By the time I found it, we were already committed.

409
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,290
真容易
Very convenient.

410
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,684
沒什麼是很容易
Believe me, there is nothing convenient

411
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,008
我們要收拾的是你的爛攤子
about this mess that you got us into!

412
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,480
嘿
Hey.

413
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,285
嘿
Hey.

414
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,727
我受不了只有這麼點錢
I'm sick and tired of having barely enough.

415
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,769
我想要更多
I want more.

416
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,289
你也是
So should you.

417
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,366
我要走了
I'm off.

418
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,524
為什麼要走
Why? Why do you have to leave?

419
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,808
有機會我會回來的
I'll come back when I get a chance.

420
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,360
好吧
Okay.

421
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,684
你拿著包幹嘛
Why are you taking that?

422
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,209
把他放在安全的地方
I'll keep it safe.

423
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,840
你好傑克
Hello, Jack.

424
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,007
-是你   -是我
- You. - Me.

425
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,201
幹完了?
Is it done?

426
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,885
沒幹完我不會回來的
I wouldn't be here if it weren't.

427
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,405
她死了嗎
She's dead?

428
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,651
-你怎麼辦的 -很簡單
- How'd you do it? - Oh, easy there, Jack.

429
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,450
你最好別知道了
The less you know, the better.

430
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,844
在種種問題前面你沒辦法說謊
That way, if people start asking questions, you don't have to lie.

431
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,569
-她…  -死了
- She's... - Gone.

432
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,005
永遠的消失了
Forever.

433
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,809
你打算醉生夢死嗎
You planning on drinking yourself to death, Jack?

434
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,125
也許吧
Maybe.

435
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,289
那是你的事情
Your business is your own.

436
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,810
我們把賬算一算
As long as we're square.

437
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,450
有什麼證據證明她死了
You got some proof for me?

438
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,046
不然我怎麼相信你
Or am I supposed to just take your word?

439
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,165
什麼 你不相信我
What, you don't trust me anymore?

440
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,689
我以為她死了你會很高興
I'd have thought you'd be glad to be rid of her.

441
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,487
解決了你所有難題
Answer to all your problems.

442
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,483
不管你怎麼想
Despite what you think,

443
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:05,290
我很愛我的妻子
I love my wife very much.

444
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,781
非常愛
Too much.

445
00:55:07,931 --> 00:55:09,927
非常棒 你的示愛方式真瘋狂
Well, you've got a crazy way of showing it.

446
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,322
因為她出軌了
Nobody makes a fool out of me.

447
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,166
錢沒了
It's gone.

448
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,843
我可不喜歡聽到這個
I don't like the sound of that.

449
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,005
愛麗絲
Alice.

450
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:29,928
別玩我 傑克
You wouldn't be playing games with me, would you, Jack?

451
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,366
什麼
What?

452
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,285
別擔心 我還有很多
No, don't worry. I have more.

453
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,010
在哪
Where?

454
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:38,004
在銀行最安全的箱子裏
At the safety deposit box at the bank.

455
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,083
嚇了我一跳
Had me worried for a moment.

456
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,603
明天我什麼時候來拿
What time shall I come back tomorrow?

457
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,561
三點之後
Give me till 3:00.

458
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,131
兩點吧
Let's make it 2:00.

459
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,766
傑克 說了這麼多 我都渴了
Jack, all this talk of booze has got me quite thirsty.

460
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,287
你知道在這附近有什麼酒吧嗎
You wouldn't know of any good bars in the area, would you?

461
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,200
媽的
Shit.

462
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,400
嘿 布魯斯
Hi, Bruce.

463
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,525
露西去哪了
Where's Lucy?

464
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,561
他還沒來上班
Oh, she hasn't showed up for work yet.

465
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,250
你知道我來這的目的嗎
You know why I'm here?

466
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,731
知道
Yeah.

467
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,769
我有一個星期的時間
You said I had a week, so that gives me at least...

468
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,485
別逗我
Don't play games.

469
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,124
我來執行公務
I'm here on police business.

470
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,769
發生了一場車禍你知道嗎
You know anything about a crash?

471
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,730
魔鬼巖那條路上
Up on Devil's Rocks Road?

472
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,330
我不知道啊
No. Should I?

473
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,764
我不覺得你有這個膽子
I didn't think you had the balls, mate.

474
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,161
我聽不懂你在說什麼
What are you talking about?

475
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:26,085
我找到了露西的車子 或者說是殘骸
I found Lucy's car, or what's left of it.

476
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,286
這些事情都在保險範圍之內
This thing has insurance job written all over it.

477
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,444
別想騙我
Don't bullshit me.

478
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,767
你保險單上有你妻子的名字嗎
You got a policy in your wife's name?

479
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:42,600
有
Yes.

480
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:46,245
我聽說
Well, one word from me in the wrong man's ear

481
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,483
殺人可不能賠償
and that claim won't clear for a bloody long time.

482
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,208
但是在我的立場上 這件事
But I'm also in a position to make this thing

483
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:55,364
顯而易見
go your way without a hitch, open and shut case.

484
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:59,482
但在這件事上 我需要得到一些補償
But for these services, I need to be compensated.

485
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,610
你說
I'm listening.

486
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,964
-我要一半   -一半？
- I want half. - Half?

487
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:09,522
你還清債務之後剩下的錢裏 我要一半
Half of what's left after you settle your debts.

488
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,966
不可能
No way!

489
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,008
考慮到你的處境 南森
Consider your options, Nathan.

490
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:17,845
我已經很慷慨了 別逼我
Okay? I'm being very generous. Don't insult me.

491
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,002
你有你妻子的牙科病歷嗎
You got a copy of your wife's dental records?

492
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,168
拿來給我複印一份
Hey? Save me a trip back here after I ring this in.

493
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,651
好吧
Yes.

494
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,131
給你
Here.

495
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,324
我真是小看你了
I underestimated you, mate.

496
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:38,646
這可是你老婆
Your own wife.

497
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,089
你可真狠心
You're a heartless fucker.

498
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,181
露西
Luce.

499
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,946
露西
Lucy!

500
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,281
露西
Lucy!

501
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:43,685
出了點問題
Bit of a problem.

502
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,251
看看這個
Read this.

503
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,324
你什麼時候收到的
When did you get this?

504
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:02,891
挺早的時候
Earlier.

505
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,449
知道誰發送的嗎？
Do you have any idea who sent it?

506
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:07,880
不知道
No.

507
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:10,766
你知道嗎
Do you?

508
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:15,524
啥 都說了不知道了
What? Of course not.

509
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,527
25萬美元
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

510
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,364
不覺得像是巧合嗎
Bit of a coincidence, don't you think?

511
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,048
郵件說他在看著我們
The email says he's watching us.

512
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,441
看誰
He?

513
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,250
你覺得是個女的嗎
Oh, you think it's a she?

514
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,925
也許吧
Maybe.

515
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,562
-你可真搞笑  -我搞笑嗎
- You're being ridiculous. - Am I?

516
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:36,041
不管是男是女 這裏提到了25萬美金
Well, he or she, all they mention here is 250 grand.

517
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:37,646
所以呢
So?

518
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,609
很明顯他們不知道保險的事
So obviously they don't know about the insurance policy

519
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,171
不然不要更多
or they'd be after a lot more.

520
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,404
你覺得我們要給嗎
You think we should pay?

521
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:45,757
媽的
Fuck.

522
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,044
我們可以先解決這個金額較少的
I think we have a chance to end this cheap.

523
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,645
少麼
Cheap?

524
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,241
比較來說
In comparison.

525
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,842
不然我們沒有別的選擇
Besides, I don't see too many options.

526
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,931
也許吧
Maybe.

527
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,804
你還有錢吧
You still have the money, don't you?

528
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:03,966
在車上
In the car.

529
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,485
怎麼了
Why?

530
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,240
擔心你會揮霍一空
Thought maybe you'd gambled it away already.

531
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,890
又開始了
Don't start.

532
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,603
-你要去嗎  -去哪
- You coming? - Where?

533
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,489
你說去哪
Where do you think?

534
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,969
我已經死了 記得?
I'm dead, remember?

535
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:49,807
她在哪
Where is she?

536
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,325
過來
Come here.

537
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,331
你特麼以為自己是誰
Who the fuck do you think you are

538
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,847
居然敢跑來責問我
coming in here accusing me of what, exactly?

539
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,570
我要讓你知道你幹了什麼
I want to know what you did.

540
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,290
那你又幹了什麼
What about what you did?

541
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,964
我還有剩下的
I had you followed.

542
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:30,407
-我想要回我的錢  -什麼錢
- I want my money back. - What money?

543
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,041
我知道她拿走了我的錢 給了你
I know she took it, I know she gave it to you,

544
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,327
我想要回來
and I want it back.

545
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,527
我沒拿你的錢
I haven't got your money.

546
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,289
是嗎
Is that right?

547
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,842
你在找這個嗎
You looking for this?

548
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:54,926
她在哪
Where is she?

549
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,725
你要打死我嗎
You gonna shoot me?

550
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:01,643
告訴我她在哪
Just tell me where she is.

551
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,885
操你媽
Fuck you.

552
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:08,690
啊
Argh!

553
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,286
啊 臥槽
Argh! Fuck!

554
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,527
你還真開槍 疼死爹了
You fucking shot me! You fucking prick!

555
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,805
她在哪
Where is she?!

556
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,365
我不知道
I don't know!

557
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:22,204
他沒告訴我
He wouldn't tell me.

558
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,486
哪個他?
Who?

559
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,608
我雇了一個傢伙 他拍了視頻
The guy I hired. The one who shot the video!

560
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,842
-他特麼叫什麼名字  -沃爾夫 查理沃爾夫
- What's his fucking name? - Wolfe! Charlie Wolfe!

561
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,604
去哪能找到他
Where can I find him?

562
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,962
就在這裏 過一會
Here, a little later.

563
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,331
為什麼
Why?

564
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,202
他要來拿酬勞
He still has to get paid.

565
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,210
什麼酬勞
Paid for what?

566
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,643
讓她消失的酬勞
Making her disappear.

567
01:04:58,360 --> 01:04:59,521
他長什麼樣
How will I recognize him?

568
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,921
他開一輛托羅納多
He drives a Toronado.

569
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:06,524
-那個遊客麼  -他不是遊客
- The tourist. - Yeah, he's no tourist.

570
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:28,569
我要怎麼做？
So, how are we gonna do this?

571
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:30,485
很容易
Well, that's the easy part.

572
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:32,648
你只要把錢放在地上
You just put the money on the ground

573
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:35,320
進你的車子然後特麼的滾蛋
and then get in your car and fuck off.

574
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,165
這可不行
Not a chance.

575
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,882
我親手來拿
We do this face-to-face or not at all.

576
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,930
事情可沒那麼簡單
You don't get to call the shots.

577
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,964
這是首付
You consider this a down payment.

578
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,565
我先保存著儲存卡
I'll keep the memory card

579
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:51,688
直到你的保險金拿到手
until the insurance policy's cleared.

580
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,205
除非我死
Over my dead body.

581
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:56,330
你妻子不是死了嗎
Isn't that over your wife's dead body?

582
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,481
去死吧你
You go to hell!

583
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:59,927
你可真不禮貌
You've got a bad attitude.

584
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,121
瞧 這是給你的錢
Look, your money is here,

585
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,362
我在這裏等你過來拿
and so am I until you come and collect it.

586
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,602
或者我直接開槍
Or I could just shoot you where you stand,

587
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,489
然後去拿錢
come and take the money.

588
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:12,530
怎麼了 你要殺掉唯一一個能拿到保險金的人嗎
What, and kill the only person that can claim the insurance policy?

589
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,531
我可不這麼想
I don't think so.

590
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:19,964
-很好  -媽的
- Yes! - Fuck!

591
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,531
臥槽
Fuck!

592
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:47,888
我不是很想殺了你的
You know, I'd prefer not to kill you.

593
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:51,451
但是我還是會
But I will.

594
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,724
我們倆清了
Just so we're clear.

595
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,883
-放過我  -不管你說什麼
- This ends today. - Whatever you say.

596
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,205
上帝啊
God!

597
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,563
媽的
Fuck!

598
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,050
你覺得很有趣嗎
Do you find something funny?!

599
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,763
你可真是個瘋子 你知道嗎
You're a fucking lunatic! You know that?

600
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,168
-看看包裏  -什麼
- Look in the bag. - Why?

601
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,923
我想看看你的表情
'Cause I want to see your face.

602
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,729
你妻子那
That wife of yours.

603
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,323
有點什麼 對吧
She's something, right?

604
01:09:06,827 --> 01:09:08,002
別碰她
Leave her alone.

605
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:12,364
告訴我錢在哪 不然我就讓她挨槍子
Tell me where the fucking money is or she eats this gun.

606
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,121
我告訴你的話...
If I tell you...

607
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:15,645
我就不會殺她
Then I won't kill her.

608
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,684
-你保證  -我發誓
- Give me your word. - I promise.

609
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:25,491
在後備箱
It's in the boot.

610
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:32,523
鑰匙在我口袋裏
The keys are... in my pocket.

611
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:11,891
-現在…  -什麼
- Now... - Yeah?

612
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,722
我會告訴你妻子
...I will be sure to tell your wife

613
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,564
你努力為她做的一切
what you tried to do for her.

614
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:18,484
你發過誓的
You promised me.

615
01:10:19,341 --> 01:10:21,528
你發誓...
You promised...

616
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:37,645
不
No.

617
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,925
不
No!

618
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:27,926
傑克
Jack?

619
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,691
傑克
Jack?

620
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,769
我要渴死了
I could murder a drink.

621
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:57,964
不管這看起來怎樣 我跟這可沒關系
Despite how this looks, I had nothing to do with it.

622
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:25,563
嘿 嘿 嘿
Hey! Hey! Hey!

623
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,121
迪倫
Dylan!

624
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:39,975
崩
Boo!

625
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:42,486
媽的
Fuck!

626
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,329
你在這特麼的做啥
What the fuck are you doing here?

627
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:50,131
該死的
Dammit!

628
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:03,009
發生了什麼事
What happened?

629
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,325
他刺傷我了
He fucking stabbed me.

630
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,084
什麼 南森
What, Nathan?

631
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,521
是啊 完全就是個瘋子
Yeah. What a complete psycho.

632
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:11,409
-你拿到錢了嗎  -對 我拿到了
- But you got the money? - Oh, I got it.

633
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:12,925
南森去哪了
Where's Nathan now?

634
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,770
我就想說這個
Yeah, about that.

635
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:18,126
-什麼   -呃...
- What about it? - Um...

636
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,164
你搞砸了嗎
Did you fuck this up?

637
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:28,126
親愛的 我今天過得很糟糕
Honey, I'm having a bad day here.

638
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:29,841
你把他殺了
You killed him?

639
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,121
他弄傷了我的手
He forced my hand.

640
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,691
你知道你在幹什麼嗎
Do you realize what you've done?

641
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:35,161
這不怪我啊 對不起
It was him or me, okay? Sorry.

642
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:36,651
混蛋 查理
Dammit, Charlie!

643
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:38,326
你想他死啊
You wanted him dead.

644
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:41,848
-是啊 在拿到保險及以後 -我能怎麼辦 那傢伙瘋了
- Yeah, after the insurance settlement. - What can I say? The guy flipped.

645
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,845
真特麼難以置信 你的工作這麼容易你還搞砸了
Un-fucking-believable. You had a simple job and you fucked it up.

646
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,926
別怪我 是你等不及了
Don't try to blame this on me. You're the one who couldn't wait.

647
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,686
你想要25萬 然後我解決了
You wanted the 250 now, so I sorted it.

648
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:52,444
解決了？
Sorted it?

649
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,841
不是讓你殺了他 你這傻逼
You weren't meant to kill him, you idiot!

650
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,405
好好說話
Watch your mouth.

651
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,161
沒有南森我們怎麼才能拿到保險金
How the fuck do we get the insurance money without Nathan?

652
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:01,402
托你的福我們的計劃全亂了
Thanks to your incompetence, our plan's utterly ruined.

653
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:03,688
這下真好 查理
That's just great, Charlie.

654
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:07,489
你丈夫可以忍受你我可不能
Your husband might have put up with your shit.

655
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:09,722
別把我跟他扯一塊去
Don't mistake me for him.

656
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,281
這是我榮幸
Well, I'd like to say it's been a pleasure.

657
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:14,566
你什麼意思
What do you mean?

658
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:16,324
我要走了
I'm leaving.

659
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,164
好 我跟你一起走
Yeah, I'm coming with you.

660
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:23,404
-這輩子都不行  -你不能就這麼走了
- Not in this life. - You can't just leave.

661
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:25,449
不然你想怎樣
What were you expecting?

662
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:29,363
-但是...  -但是我們上過床了?
- But... - What, because we fucked?

663
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,724
當做是我給你的額外福利好了
Consider it a fringe benefit.

664
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:35,689
先分錢
We split the money first.

665
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:37,884
別這麼貪財
No need to be greedy.

666
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,522
你會繼承酒店的
You're about to inherit the hotel.

667
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:42,764
你說什麼
What are you talking about?

668
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:44,086
你會知道的
You'll see.

669
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:45,920
知道什麼？
I'll see what?

670
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:47,445
再見 親愛的
So long, honey.

671
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:49,525
-把儲存卡給我    -什麼
- Give me the card! - What?

672
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:51,484
儲存卡 給我相機儲存卡
The card! The memory card from the camera.

673
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:53,170
給我
Give it to me!

674
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:58,411
你是我見過的最聰明或者最瘋狂的女人
You are either the craziest or the cleverest bitch I have ever met.

675
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,290
我不能決定是哪個
I can't decide.

676
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,524
搞什麼
What the fuck?!

677
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:13,205
迪倫 你在這幹嘛
Dylan, what are you doing here?

678
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:14,771
我也要問你
I could ask you the same thing.

679
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:18,129
天啊 這地方就是個露天瘋人院
God, this place is like a fucking open-air insane asylum!

680
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:21,963
-這就算你拿到的酬勞嗎  -什麼酬勞
- Is this what you did it for? - Did what?

681
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:24,282
別裝傻 傑克都告訴我了
Don't play dumb. Jack filled me in on your deal.

682
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:25,930
不 你誤會了
No, look, you've got it all wrong.

683
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,560
-少他媽說謊  -我沒碰她一根汗毛
- Don't fucking lie. - I didn't touch her.

684
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:31,889
他騙人 是他幹的 是他殺了愛麗絲
He's lying. He did it. He killed Alice.

685
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,565
你這個婊子
You fucking snake!

686
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,603
他還殺了南森
And he killed Nathan.

687
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,447
對 是她殺了愛麗絲 她殺的
Look, if you want to know who killed Alice, she did.

688
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:41,605
迪倫 我發誓…
Dylan, I swear to God...

689
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,125
我能證明
Look, I can prove it.

690
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:45,442
-他在說謊  -閉嘴
- He's lying! - Shut the fuck up!

691
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,045
我知道是你殺了她
I know you killed her.

692
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:53,083
她死了 你也得死
She's dead, and so are you.

693
01:20:58,284 --> 01:20:59,845
射的好
Nice shot!

694
01:21:00,977 --> 01:21:02,491
我...
I...

695
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:21,845
射偏了
Fuck's sake.

696
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:29,370
是時候送你遠離痛苦了
Time we put you out of your misery.

697
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:38,645
不 不 不 不
No, no! No! No!

698
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:16,364
是我拿的錢
I took the money.

699
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:17,965
我知道
I know.

700
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:31,611
怎麼了
What?

701
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:35,326
喂?
Yeah?

702
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:38,925
我一個小時後到
I'll be there in an hour.

703
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:44,690
不如兩個小時吧
Better make that two.

704
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:48,370
臥槽
Fuck's sake.
