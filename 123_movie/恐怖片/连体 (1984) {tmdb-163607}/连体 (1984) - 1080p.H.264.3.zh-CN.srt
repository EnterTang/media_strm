1
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,650
What's the matter?

2
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:30,880
Nothing

3
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,850
Are you sure?

4
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,490
Do you want some medicine?

5
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:40,860
Thank You

6
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,360
Sir, please fasten your seat belt

7
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,100
Thank You

8
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,940
Would you be going home immediately?

9
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,200
Of course

10
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,000
Hope to see them as soon as we land

11
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,570
Why didn't you request them to receive you?

12
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,670
Oh, just want to give them a surprise

13
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,040
How far is it from the airport to my home?

14
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,350
Not far, it takes less than 20 minutes

15
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,750
Hong Kong is a small place

16
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,410
Very much unlike Canada...

17
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,150
where it takes an hour to go anywhere

18
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,160
Young master!

19
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,600
Where's Dad?

20
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,000
He has gone to a ball

21
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,970
He asked me to come and pick you up

22
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,260
He will be back a little later

23
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,010
Dad's always busy. I rarely get to see him

24
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,850
We'll drop Miss Kei off first

25
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,550
Hong Kong is so busy even at night

26
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,930
Well, that's Hong Kong

27
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,530
How long will it take to my home?

28
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,840
Quite soon

29
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,000
Headache again?

30
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,540
Are you alright?

31
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,740
Maybe I am not used to it

32
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,800
Who could it be? It's really late

33
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,170
It's late, you better return home

34
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,510
It's okay, I'll walk you up

35
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,710
- Po-erh - Daddy

36
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,290
It's you!

37
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,410
Uncle

38
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,390
I'm Michael, Michael Cho

39
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,830
I am Po-erh's classmate, we...

40
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,020
See you tomorrow

41
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,920
Okay. Goodbye, uncle

42
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,020
Thank you

43
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,160
You're welcome.

44
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,070
- See you - Bye

45
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,830
You came back all of a sudden,

46
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,000
does your auntie know about it?

47
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,630
Had she known, she wouldn't have allowed

48
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,110
All my classmates go for holidays every year

49
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,340
Only I used to be left out. So boring!

50
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,380
I've graduated this year

51
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,070
This year? So soon, huh!

52
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,880
Go and greet mummy

53
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,420
Guess who is here?

54
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,450
Mommy

55
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,230
Come sit here and talk to your mother

56
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,270
I'll get some tea.

57
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,280
Let me do it, you stay with your daughter

58
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,210
Was it a long flight?

59
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,340
Yeah

60
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,020
You're in university, isn't it?

61
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,990
I graduated.

62
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,510
I wanna call uncle Cheung

63
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,710
He doesn't know I am back

64
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,710
Okay

65
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,810
Where's the phone?

66
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,910
Telephone... over there

67
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,120
Have some tea

68
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:31,820
Thanks

69
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,060
Mommy

70
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,260
You have some rest

71
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,810
What is it? Why're you hiding in here?

72
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,250
Your daughter's back. Why not come on out?

73
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,420
What're you afraid of?

74
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,020
Nothing. There's nothing to fear

75
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,330
She is your own daughter

76
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,660
Hey, come on

77
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,430
Okay, see you tomorrow. Bye

78
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,670
You must be tired. Go to bed early

79
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,210
Have an early morning tea with daddy tomorrow

80
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,140
Tomorrow I'm meeting uncle Cheung

81
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,080
What's up?

82
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,820
Nothing

83
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,250
Daddy, I want to look at the room I lived in

84
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,020
Alright

85
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,820
Po-erh, why don't you turn on the light?

86
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,120
She...

87
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,650
What?

88
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,450
Nothing

89
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,820
You sleep here tonight

90
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:16,890
Goodnight

91
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,370
Goodnight

92
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,150
Why does she stay in my room?

93
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,390
I don't like her to use my stuff

94
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,360
She takes my bed, where should I sleep then?

95
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,060
Mommy! I don't like her!

96
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,190
Don't... don't push me

97
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,420
Help... help!

98
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,840
Mommy

99
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,140
Sorry

100
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,110
Oh, it's alright

101
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,650
Has daddy left for the office?

102
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,620
I'll get it

103
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:36,960
She...

104
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,100
Good morning!

105
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,110
Uncle Cheung

106
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,310
Hey, how come you're back so suddenly?

107
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,500
Come on in

108
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,380
Take a seat

109
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,350
Uncle never lets you down. I came over...

110
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,050
to meet you as soon as I got your call

111
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,020
How's your auntie?

112
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:58,960
She is fine.

113
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,760
What's the matter?

114
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,530
God knows what's happening to my head

115
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,900
Always seem to have this strange headache

116
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,270
You think too much

117
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,440
No, I'll get used to it

118
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,280
You think I ought to have it checked?

119
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,220
I better attend the kitchen

120
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,260
How could it be?

121
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,570
What?

122
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,960
It seems mom isn't happy with my return

123
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,210
Oh, come on!

124
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,640
Do you have time later?

125
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,320
I'll take you to my place to have a look

126
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,490
There's nothing wrong with my niece

127
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,760
Too studious. Could be a nervous breakdown

128
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,800
Of late she's been complaining of pains

129
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,690
Have you given her a check-up?

130
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,670
Yes, I've seen her grow up

131
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,500
I know her family quite well

132
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,700
The Mrs. Kei I mentioned to you before

133
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,570
She's her daughter

134
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,410
I visit her in Canada almost every year

135
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,440
Ask her to meet me in a couple of days

136
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,950
Let me check my schedule

137
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:34,980
Take a seat

138
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,780
lt'd be best if she can make it today

139
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,590
Tell her to come over at 3 o'clock

140
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,620
Okay, thank you

141
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,090
- Alright then - Bye

142
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,420
What should we do?

143
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,900
What is it? Po-erh asked me this morning

144
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,700
Aren't you happy with her coming back?

145
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,370
Yes, I really didn't want her to return

146
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,270
Couldn't even sleep well last night.

147
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,040
Persuade her to go back to Canada

148
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:04,810
Relax. She's here just for her holidays

149
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,480
You two are meeting after so long

150
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:10,110
Take her somewhere for fun and enjoyment

151
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,480
Why don't you understand?

152
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,250
She can't stay back

153
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,300
She cannot stay and live here

154
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,930
Do you remember...

155
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,360
why I sent her to Canada?

156
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,130
Why aren't you all willing to believe me?

157
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,200
You would trust me...

158
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,740
when something untoward happens, is it?

159
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,930
Ching-yi

160
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,510
Do you remember, as a child she always...

161
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,510
fell down the stairs for no reason at all;

162
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,980
or even get seriously ill

163
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,640
You go to fetch it

164
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,060
You forgot that when she was four,

165
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,570
she had gone to chase the ball

166
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,800
and almost got knocked down by a car

167
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,400
These things always happen to children

168
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:05,480
No, it's because of Bei-erh

169
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,610
I saw it myself

170
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,120
She pushed Po-erh everytime

171
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,050
for winning toys

172
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,910
Ching-yi, not again!

173
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,390
I thought you are getting better...

174
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,790
with your mental illness

175
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,160
Who knew it'd strike again after seeing your daughter

176
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,530
Actually, she's been around all these years

177
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,200
Hence I don't even keep Po-erh's photo

178
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:33,210
You think I don't like to visit Po-erh

179
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,430
But we never go

180
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:39,300
Anyway, I'm here. Everything will be fine

181
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,350
She'd better leave soon

182
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:45,950
Don't cry

183
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,610
With time she will forget it all.

184
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,020
We've already forgotten it for so long

185
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,650
Seeing you so flustered,

186
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,790
She will doubt about it all the more

187
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,470
I knew you'd come looking for him

188
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:14,050
If he could ask Po-erh to return to Canada

189
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,080
I feared she'd overhear so I didn't speak to you

190
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,680
You are not happy with her return

191
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,380
I don't know what's on your mind

192
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,060
Principal Cheung

193
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,920
Please don't spoil my relationship with my daughter

194
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,690
You misunderstand me

195
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,460
No, I don't

196
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,760
For the past twenty odd years,

197
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,670
You've stayed with her more than we have

198
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,100
You go to Canada several times a year

199
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,180
The silly girl assumes you're really fond of her

200
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,180
What do you mean?

201
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,440
What do I mean!

202
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,710
Po-erh is a medical miracle

203
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,220
But it's all for yourself

204
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,480
You just want to complete the medical report

205
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,190
Let me tell you

206
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,780
Don't consider that since my daughter's back

207
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,950
You can drop by every now and then

208
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,560
Excuse me. I've a lunch appointment with a friend

209
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,510
Should you drive that fast?

210
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:19,570
After seeing the doctor...

211
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,980
Come over for dinner. My parents wanna meet you

212
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,180
No.

213
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,380
Hey, why do you avoid me...

214
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,180
every time?

215
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,950
You wished to come back, I accompanied you

216
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,580
I didn't ask you to

217
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,820
Yes. You didn't

218
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,920
Come to my place for dinner?

219
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,490
Told you I didn't want to

220
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,800
If you don't promise then I won't drive

221
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,760
Why do you always act like that?

222
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,760
Don't be so childish, okay?

223
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,510
Bonnie, I am sincere

224
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,770
However you ought to watch your temper

225
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,610
Honestly, I'm being quite accommodating

226
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,380
I know it's quite hard on you

227
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,680
But I didn't ask you to do that

228
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,490
I just want to be with you

229
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,580
Is there anything wrong with that?

230
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,920
Quiet! My car is broke down

231
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,800
Hey, move your car!

232
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,940
Boy, driving Rolls Royce is not a big deal

233
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,740
Go to hell

234
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,470
Are you sure you can drive?

235
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,370
Please start the car

236
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,110
Then you've got to promise me

237
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:29,950
Do what you like

238
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,740
- Bonnie - Look out!

239
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,490
I'm sorry

240
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,260
Are you alright?

241
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,360
What's wrong with you?

242
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,600
You almost killed her by driving that fast

243
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,330
Are you blind?

244
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,460
Stop arguing. I'm alright. Get in

245
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,280
Would've sued him if you hadn't stopped me

246
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,910
Are you coming with me to the doctor?

247
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,080
It's hard to believe that...

248
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,780
driving in Hong Kong would be that crazy!

249
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,250
Then you aren't a Hong Kong-ite, is it? Move on

250
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:23,370


251
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,510
You really need to see this kind of doctor?

252
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:30,770
Are you okay?

253
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,180
I'm nervous. I would chop people at any time

254
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,550
Principal Cheung asked me to come

255
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,120
I made an appointment for 3 p. M

256
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,690
Miss Kei, please come on in

257
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:49,290
Take a seat

258
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,260
Okay

259
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,390
Doctor Poon

260
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,570
Okay, bye-bye

261
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,300
Take a seat

262
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,210
Would you like a candy?

263
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,780
On diet?

264
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,190
What's the time now?

265
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,690
3:15 p. M

266
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,230
I'm sitting for an exam. Perhaps I won't succeed

267
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,860
You too?

268
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,500
Hi. I'm not late today, is it?

269
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,340
Doctor has a patient right now, you need to wait

270
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,430
No problem!

271
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,460
What time is it?

272
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,840
I don't know

273
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,240
Why do you drive a motorbike?

274
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,280
Why?

275
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,410
No traffic jam and it could be parked anywhere

276
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,680
You haven't been on one before?

277
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:27,390
My nervousness- could it turn to dementia?

278
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,960
Won't be that serious.

279
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,930
But last night I can swear I saw a little girl

280
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,860
Perhaps it was just an illusion

281
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:38,100
Oh no, my perception was real

282
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,530
What do you feel wrong?

283
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,910
I asked uncle to recommend me a specialist

284
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,500
To get a second opinion, sort of

285
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,080
Uncle Cheung said I'm fine. It's just my mind

286
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,990
Okay, come here at 10 a. M tomorrow

287
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,810
- Wendy - Bonnie!

288
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:58,860
How come you're back in Hong Kong?

289
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,590
Why not? My parents are here

290
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,490
Last year your auntie didn't allow you

291
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,830
How did she agree this year?

292
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,160
God, she's so strict. How did you manage?

293
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,230
You know how old am I this year?

294
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,860
Can't even make my own decisions?

295
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,540
Miss Li

296
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,970
Doctor Poon!

297
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,440
Ask Mr Wong to come.

298
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,980
I'm in a hurry, may I jam in?

299
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,480
But I made an appointment for 3.30 p. M

300
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,980
Dear, let me first!

301
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,480
Bonnie, don't forget to call me!

302
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,830
Who is she?

303
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,520
She was my classmate in Canada

304
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,990
She came back without graduating

305
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,560
We're old friends

306
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,690
She's quite a rightful girl, but a bit naughty

307
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:43,000
And meeting handsome boys she goes gaga

308
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,480
What's wrong?

309
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,910
Yes! Yes!

310
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,980
It's painful. My stomach!

311
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,180
Nurse Li...

312
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,090
I've never met a shy doctor like you

313
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,190
There you go crazy again!

314
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:15,770
Don't be angry. I will come to see you often.

315
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,640
What's wrong with you, Miss Chu?

316
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:22,710
I am tense and always miss you

317
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:26,800
My heart is beating fast,

318
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,110
just like it would jump out.

319
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,250
That Wendy, does she have a mental disorder?

320
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,550
Don't say like that...

321
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:36,350
Why else would she come to see a shrink!

322
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,680
The doctor is a neurosurgeon

323
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,720
Whatever!

324
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,690
What good can such a doctor be?

325
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,660
You know, in Canada...

326
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,560
I can easily hire a couple of them for you

327
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,460
Michael

328
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:46,760
What?

329
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,100
I didn't ask you to pay the bill, did I?

330
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,860
Why on earth do you differentiate

331
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,460
Everything of mine is yours too

332
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:55,070
Let me make it clear, we're just friends

333
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,470
Don't do anything for me, don't interfere in my life

334
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,440
All I'm saying is, I just care about you

335
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,740
I'd never come to such third-rate doctors

336
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,710
Even then I come along with you

337
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,880
If you like to argue on streets...

338
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:07,850
you just go ahead

339
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,650
Where are you going? My car is over there

340
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,990
Where are you going?

341
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,790
I need some breathing space

342
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,800
Michael, I can't stand you anymore.

343
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,460
How many times a day you have got mad?

344
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,170
Ms Kei

345
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,770
Doctor Poon. You're leaving

346
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,630
Could you drop me off?

347
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,580
Sure. My bike is right ahead

348
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,950
Please don't! It's dangerous on a bike

349
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,360
Relax, it's alright if she holds me tight

350
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:55,190
Bonnie... l'll call you tonight

351
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,670
Principal Cheung said that all along...

352
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,940
you've been with your aunt in Canada

353
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,600
Also that you're here just for a few days

354
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,010
You know him very well?

355
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,480
Why are you still here?

356
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,560
Bonnie went off with some friends

357
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,630
I feel totally lost

358
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,090
She has left you behind?

359
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,530
No way

360
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:26,220
I accompanied her to the doctor. We're quite close

361
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,600
You wouldn't understand

362
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,530
Where are you going right now?

363
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,000
I don't know, it's a bit early for dinner...

364
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,610
Maybe get the car first

365
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,340
You have got a car? That's cool!

366
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,670
Give me a ride

367
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,880
Ok. Where do you want to go?

368
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,320
Didn't you say it's a bit early for dinner?

369
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,090
How about we go shopping at Stanley

370
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,350
I hear there're some real good jeans shops there

371
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:53,020
Alright then, we'll keep driving around

372
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:53,820
Come on

373
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,230
It's really your car? Have you borrowed it?

374
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:00,830
Borrowed? You lend me one then

375
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,800
It's cool with a boyfriend having such a car

376
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,210
That's right

377
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,810
Not many boys would be as lucky as me

378
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,710
I am the only child, you know

379
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,250
I can easily have many cars like these

380
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,290
I will inherit all the business from my father

381
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,780
Oh boy, Bonnie sure is lucky to know you

382
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,510
Of course

383
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,060
Riding in a convertible is such fun!

384
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,360
Sit down! You sit down

385
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,590
I want to fly

386
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,430
Are you crazy? The car is moving

387
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,630
Why're you scared? The road is ours

388
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,240
Why did you move to the back seat?

389
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,770
Don't play with my hair

390
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,900
Stop playing

391
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,010
Don't play. Please sit down immediately

392
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,490
Stop. What are you doing?

393
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,250
Let me drive, okay?

394
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,760
Stop it. Sit down

395
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,590
What's wrong with you? You're such a bother

396
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,500
Don't be that serious. I was just kidding

397
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,930
You call that ' kidding '?

398
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,830
Give me a try

399
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,600
Stop, otherwise you get out of my car

400
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,400
I won't ever date you

401
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,270
I'm friend of Po-erh.

402
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,970
You are her boyfriend

403
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,950
I can't date you, can I?

404
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,710
I just wanted to test you

405
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,350
Sit properly

406
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,860
C'mon, start the car. Should I drive, huh?

407
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,150
Come on

408
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:42,870
I won't go back to Canada.

409
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:43,960
Is it alright, daddy?

410
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,360
Okay

411
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,880
Then I'll tidy up the room tomorrow

412
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,310
Oh, no!

413
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,910
Don't touch anything in the baby room

414
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,010
Never

415
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,180
I'd say that bed is not more than four feet

416
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,950
How can you expect our daughter to sleep there?

417
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,620
What would you do staying back in Hong Kong?

418
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,460
Think about how much your aunt would miss you

419
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,260
I'd rather you call auntie and ask her

420
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,800
I just ask, who is my mom; you or her?

421
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,060
Po-erh!

422
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,960
I was just a few years old when you sent me there

423
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,010
You've hardly given a thought to me all these years

424
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,900
Sometimes I doubt if I am your daughter!

425
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,450
Po-erh!

426
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,740
Okay. If you don't like me...

427
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:33,720
I would move out tomorrow

428
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,320
Po-erh!

429
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,280
Po-erh!

430
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,030
Po-erh!

431
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:29,220
No more. Just this bag left, Mr. Janitor

432
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,400
And to say being abroad all these years

433
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,600
Nothing you've learnt, but making fun of your dad

434
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,570
I love you, I just love you!

435
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,440
Right, I'd like to invite you all for a dinner together

436
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:43,240
Great! We'll go to your father's...

437
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:45,370
- Bamboo restaurant - That's it

438
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,450
Okay then

439
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:48,510
I have an appointment tonight

440
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,990
lt'd be fun; you both are invited

441
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,910
Right

442
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,220
Is it a boy or girl?

443
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,390
Whatever! None of your business

444
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:57,850
Who is he?

445
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,950
Your boyfriend?

446
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,330
Poon Chi-ching.

447
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,530
- He? - Him?

448
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:03,970
Who is he?

449
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,190
Please

450
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:40,340
Uncle Cheung

451
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:41,970
Come sit here

452
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,810
You're naughty

453
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:56,710
Going home with someone you've hardly known!

454
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:00,020
It's his idea to bring you here on your birthday

455
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,190
Happy Birthday!

456
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,800
What is it?

457
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,130
Open it and see

458
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:08,860
Thank you, Uncle Cheung

459
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:14,940
What do you think?

460
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,370
It's really pretty

461
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,270
Do you like it?

462
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,440
Of course. I'll put it on right now

463
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:27,540
Just a small gift. Happy Birthday

464
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,130
Thank you

465
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,350
Let me get you some drink

466
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:48,800
This wasn't my idea, I swear

467
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,700
No...

468
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,410
Put this on

469
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:00,950
Thanks

470
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,320
Without doubt, your house is haunted

471
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,530
Now you're really scaring me

472
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,830
Who is scaring you!

473
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,840
My driver said your place used to be a burial ground

474
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,070
Don't say it!

475
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,140
You're more likely to see a ghost if you're scared

476
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,810
What?

477
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,910
I've heard that if your forehead looks black...

478
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:09,680
You will see a ghost sooner or later

479
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:12,120
What is it? Where?

480
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:17,860
Here! Bad luck is here!

481
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,830
Where?

482
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:19,660
Right here

483
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:20,860
I can't see

484
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:23,700
Right here. You see

485
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,400
Sorry, I've to go first

486
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,080
I got a little sick. I am leaving too

487
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:34,710
I'll drop you off

488
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:35,870
No need. Bye

489
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,640
Goodbye

490
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,710
You stay with Miss Chu for a while

491
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,250
Actually we both are headed the same way

492
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,350
Where do we go afterwards?

493
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,160
Do you really feel sick?

494
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:53,790
Couldn't you feel that...

495
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,530
Wendy's got a crush on Michael?

496
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,390
I just brought romance to a happy ending

497
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,740
Isn't it for both of them and yourself?

498
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:19,850
Why? Why?

499
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,020
What are you doing?

500
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,490
I've known you for two years, and he?

501
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,490
Michael, I told you before

502
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,860
What is it?

503
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:29,900
Think you can woo her just because you're a doctor

504
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,470
What is it that I'm not good at?

505
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,270
Be mature. Okay?

506
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:35,970
We will never be together

507
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,300
But he?

508
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:39,740
You totally don't understand.

509
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,730
Oh, I told him to take her home first

510
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,300
- Oh yeah? - Yes

511
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,900
- Is it? - Yes

512
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,870
- Yes? - Yes

513
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:09,700
Don't be upset. Revenge is the key

514
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,820
Daddy, Mommy

515
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,560
Come, let me introduce

516
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,500
My daddy, mommy

517
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,690
And he is doctor Poon Chi-ching

518
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,360
How are you?

519
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:36,030
Uncle, Auntie

520
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,100
Where are you going?

521
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,330
- For a movie - For tea

522
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,770
Yes. We'll be back soon

523
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,240
Sit for a while

524
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,900
Tonight we'll have dinner together

525
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:50,710
We have to leave, see you

526
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,110
Bye bye

527
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,070
Daddy, mommy

528
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,410
Who is she?

529
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,910
She's your sister, died from meningoencephalitis

530
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,460
Hello

531
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,760
Doctor Poon

532
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,490
It's you, what's up?

533
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,690
Doctor Poon. Hurry over to my place

534
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,770
God knows why Po-erh is feeling depressed and sick

535
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,740
She is not willing to see any doctor either

536
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,970
lt'd be wonderful if you can come immediately

537
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,500
Ask her to talk to me

538
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,570
She doesn't want to. She won't speak to you either

539
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,270
Okay. You come over right away

540
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,210
Alright, you stay with her

541
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,840
As soon as possible. Bye

542
00:35:58,950 --> 00:35:59,820
Bye Bye

543
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,220
I just feel it's not a good idea

544
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,320
What's wrong with it?

545
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,420
Don't you wanna take revenge?

546
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:13,360
You have called him and he is coming

547
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,300
What should I do?

548
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,100
Hide yourself in the kitchen first

549
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,610
I've never done it before

550
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,540
What's there to be scared of? Go into the room!

551
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,910
Hi!

552
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,050
Where is Po-erh?

553
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,050
Come in first

554
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:39,290
Sit down

555
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,590
Where is Po-erh? How is she?

556
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:42,990
What would you like to drink?

557
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,620
Nothing. Is she gone?

558
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,090
You seems nervous

559
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,800
Bet you wouldn't be here that fast had it been for me

560
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,630
If Po-erh is not here, I'd better leave

561
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,800
I've got things to do

562
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,470
She is inside the room, come along

563
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,670
Come on

564
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,740
Where is Po-erh? She is not here?

565
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:06,480
What Po-erh? Do you know how much I miss you?

566
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,580
Miss Chu

567
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,310
Miss Chu, don't play with me

568
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:15,330
No, I'm serious

569
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:17,720
Miss Chu

570
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:20,560
You know I love you. I love you very much

571
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,690
Miss Chu

572
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,270
You're crazy! Stop doing that

573
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:26,170
Day and night I think of you

574
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,400
Stop it

575
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,970
So this is how you see your patients!

576
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,240
No one would believe you anymore

577
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:36,100
I'm warning you, keep away from my girlfriend

578
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,480
I will show her these pictures

579
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,140
I'm sure she'll detest you hereafter

580
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,890
You...

581
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:44,050
Me? It's my house

582
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,620
I can do anything I want

583
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,980
You're naive. To think she'd trust you two!

584
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,130
Well? Is my idea good enough?

585
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,490
I don't see any reason to get scared

586
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,310
I hate her

587
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:58,550
I want her to jump down the roof by herself

588
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,260
Bei-erh. Bei-erh...

589
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,090
Don't do it. Come out. She is your sister

590
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,460
Bei-erh. Bei-erh...

591
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:12,730
Don't. Let me out

592
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:21,980
Bei-erh. Don't do it. Bei-erh

593
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,050
Let me out please

594
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:26,580
Why are you yelling inside?

595
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,350
I can't open the door

596
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:29,820
Can't open the door

597
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:33,790
Quick, follow me

598
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,090
Po-erh is on the roof. Something will happen.

599
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,290
Let's go

600
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:41,030
What? Po-erh is on the roof?

601
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,930
Po-erh. Po-erh...

602
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:52,010
Po-erh, what are you doing?

603
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,640
Po-erh...

604
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,710
Don't go further, Po-erh!

605
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,850
Po-erh!

606
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:06,190
Po-erh...

607
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:27,810
Po-erh

608
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,370
Uncle and auntie. What has happened with Po-erh?

609
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,170
Chi-ching...

610
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,900
Po-erh has been there for long...

611
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,510
Why would she be that careless?

612
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:04,040
I don't know why she would go on the roof

613
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:06,650
How is Po-erh?

614
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,190
It's alright. It's just a minor injury

615
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:09,950
It's lucky there was something as the cushion

616
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,950
Could she leave the hospital tonight?

617
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:14,320
Not yet. She needs observation

618
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:15,590
I'll stay with her then

619
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:18,420
No need. She's fine and you should go have a rest

620
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:19,930
Principal Cheung said it's ok

621
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,430
You don't understand that

622
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:22,690
It's all my fault

623
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,000
Because of me she has this sleepwalking illness

624
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:26,940
Let's go home and talk it over

625
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,130
No. I'm not going home. Let me be here

626
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,730
If you wish you can go back home yourself

627
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,180
Which room is she in?

628
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:37,010
Nurse, bring her to room 108

629
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:38,980
I've got to go

630
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:41,750
Principal Cheung, I have something to ask you

631
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,590
I want to see Po-erh's medical history

632
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,760
Her case is getting more serious

633
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,400
If you really want to help her

634
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:02,030
Please let me have her medical history

635
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:04,940
Sorry, without the consent of her parents

636
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,380
I can't give it to you

637
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:11,420
You know her mother has been to the phrenitis hospital

638
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,040
For the betterment of Po-erh and her mother

639
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:16,520
I suggest you mind your own business

640
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:17,750
Since you knew she has sleepwalking disorder

641
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,120
Why don't you take her to see a brain specialist?

642
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,890
It's all her own imagination

643
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:22,720
You're not cheating her but wish to keep it from me

644
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:25,550
It's late. Let's talk about it some other time

645
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:27,130
What exactly are you trying to hide?

646
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:29,090
Tell me, principal Cheung!

647
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:51,010
You're fortunate enough to be saved last time

648
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,050
I won't let you go

649
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,780
I'll let you know how it feels like to die unjustly

650
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:01,160
Help!

651
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,660
What's the matter?

652
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,890
Ghost.

653
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:05,690
Where is it?

654
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,460
She was staring at me on the bed

655
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,270
No. Po-erh

656
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,830
I am not staying here. I must leave

657
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:16,340
This place is haunted. I don't want to stay here

658
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,140
I've got to move out

659
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,770
I've to return home...

660
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:24,110
She is staring at me

661
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:26,240
I don't want to stay here, Mom

662
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,580
You two shared one brain

663
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:34,490
Without surgery, both of you would have died

664
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,330
Why did they hide it from me all this time?

665
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,500
It's all for you. They don't want to affect you

666
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:57,040
Don't be upset. I understand your feeling

667
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:04,860
I looked at her and she looked...

668
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,760
It seemed as if she really hates me

669
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:12,200
It's real...

670
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:16,660
She kept staring at me...

671
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:20,760
Calm down. It's your illusion

672
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:22,670
There just aren't any ghosts in this world

673
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,570
You listen to me. No

674
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,710
She is unfortunate,

675
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:35,550
but she is not the sufferer

676
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,920
Your mother suffers the most

677
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:43,590
She went crazy after giving birth to siamese twins

678
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,150
Later she had to be admitted to the phrenitis hospital

679
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:52,140
You have to forgive your mom. Only you can help

680
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:12,960
Where is Po-erh?

681
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:16,250
Chi-ching has brought her out

682
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,390
Chi-ching has seen Po-erh's medical history

683
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:21,520
What?

684
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:24,430
How could you let him get away with it?

685
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,710
This is all just because I trust you

686
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:31,300
You don't need to say this

687
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:38,310
Where is Bei-erh?

688
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,440
It's your great work!

689
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:46,250
Bei-erh

690
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,260
Ching-yi, you've just got one daughter

691
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,090
Po-erh is your only daughter

692
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,260
She is living with you. Don't think too much

693
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:56,530
No!

694
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:00,800
Give me back my Bei-erh

695
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:02,500
I have two daughters

696
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,570
Bei-erh...

697
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:10,080
Bei-erh is in this house

698
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:11,480
Get out, you get out.

699
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:14,580
You killed my daughter...

700
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:16,450
and made my wife get a serious phrenitis

701
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,050
And what're you going to do now?

702
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,790
Not enough for me?

703
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:22,120
I don't understand your words

704
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:24,130
You don't

705
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:25,920
If you weren't sure in the past you should've stayed away

706
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:27,690
I won't let you kill my daughter

707
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,160
I had told you that...

708
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:31,860
the chance of the surgery is 50%

709
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:33,400
If you didn't sign the paper, I won't...

710
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:34,370
I should've known better

711
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:38,200
Yes. I admit that the surgery failed

712
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:40,670
But if it was a success,

713
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,710
one of them would've surely turned out insane

714
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:44,150
I would rather have an idiot daughter...

715
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:46,080
instead of pushing my wife into pain

716
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:51,450
I suggest you to take her away from this house

717
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,920
Don't let her live in the past

718
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:55,390
I am not leaving!

719
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:00,120
Bei-erh will be alone if I left

720
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:04,770
I will not go. You get out. And you

721
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:07,300
You leave. I don't want to see you

722
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:10,380
Both of you, get out

723
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,440
Ching-yi! Go and rest

724
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:14,540
Get out

725
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:16,410
Listen to me. Ching-yi

726
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:21,720
Ching-yi!

727
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:23,580
Leave me alone. Get off

728
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:25,090
Let her bite

729
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:26,120
Release

730
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:31,160
Ching-yi

731
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,960
Let her rest on the sofa

732
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,630
Send her to hospital immediately

733
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:55,050
Why did you punch her so hard?

734
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:57,080
Hadn't I done that she'd have bitten you to death

735
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,680
You always hit your wife

736
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:03,490
Nothing is good when you're here

737
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:15,770
No brake!

738
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:17,100
Watch out...

739
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,700
Why the car can't stop?

740
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,870
It's Principal Cheung's car

741
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:53,810
Go to have a look.

742
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:01,220
- Uncle Cheung - Principal Cheung

743
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,020
Be careful

744
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,890
Daddy

745
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:13,860
Uncle

746
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:15,730
Daddy...

747
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:26,800
- Uncle... - Daddy...

748
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:29,010
Quick!

749
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:37,420
- Mommy - Auntie

750
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,850
What's wrong? Mommy

751
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:40,150
Auntie

752
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:05,980
Auntie

753
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,420
Do you recognise me? I'm Michael

754
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:18,930
You father must hate me a lot

755
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,930
He didn't come just because he is busy

756
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:27,970
He will never forgive me

757
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,880
We've to go out for a while

758
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:46,650
Auntie, take some rest. Don't think too much

759
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:52,690
Wake me up if your father comes

760
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:57,230
I've got lots to tell him. Don't forget

761
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:04,310
I haven't seen principal for all day long, why?

762
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:08,240
You get some sleep. We'll soon be back with you

763
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,640
Mommy, I will stay with you

764
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:12,920
Don't cry

765
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,920
They are so unlucky

766
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,190
Lower your voice. Auntie might hear

767
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:28,970
Wendy and I will stay with you...

768
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:30,760
and you won't be afraid of the dark

769
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:34,460
It is an accident. A person can't live two lives

770
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,140
Don't be so upset

771
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,430
Let's go

772
00:53:56,830 --> 00:54:00,590
Eat something. Don't keep silent all day

773
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:06,200
You have to eat something

774
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:08,100
We'll go sailing tomorrow

775
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:10,700
My brother'll lend me a yacht. We'll have lots of seafood

776
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,200
Daddy

777
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:15,840
Let's talk tomorrow

778
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:18,210
How about we go to a disco tonight!

779
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,780
I don't feel like. You two go together

780
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:27,520
Hello

781
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:28,350
Thank you. Kei Po-erh

782
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:29,980
- Doctor Poon? - Yes

783
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:32,760
Don't bother me

784
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:40,290
She doesn't want... No... She...

785
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:44,500
Stop calling her anymore

786
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:46,710
I'm here. You're not needed

787
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:48,680
Hello

788
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,180
Go out for a while

789
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:50,770
No

790
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,850
I'm downstairs

791
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:53,580
Then it's okay

792
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:56,410
I'm going out for some time. I'll return soon

793
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,220
Where are you going?

794
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,150
Sit here first

795
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:04,530
It's late at night. I'll accompany you

796
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:05,990
No need

797
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:17,000
Damn it. It makes me sick

798
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:20,810
Could you tell me why?

799
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:27,450
I came back from Canada with her

800
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:30,680
I accompany her no matter where she goes

801
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:32,280
Also went with her to see such a doctor

802
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,290
However she isn't willing to come home once for dinner

803
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:44,470
What? You like to bring others home for dinner?

804
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:49,210
She has no time for a drive,

805
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:51,330
no time for a dance

806
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,000
No no and no for all day

807
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,520
A boyfriend like me,

808
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:02,950
what's wrong?

809
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:05,980
I can stand. I can wait

810
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:09,580
Even for my own dad I don't show such patience

811
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:12,750
Don't be angry. Who the hell asked you to do all that?

812
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:19,030
You don't know. Po-erh is conservative

813
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,610
She is...

814
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:23,470
What?

815
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:30,480
Have some wine, I've got lots to tell you

816
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:31,340
Here

817
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:34,020
Sorry

818
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:30,580
Why is it so difficult for you to face the truth?

819
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:32,920
What happened to your dad and uncle is an accident

820
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:36,790
Don't try to blame yourself

821
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:38,160
This way it's likely you'll go crazy

822
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:41,920
Get real, Po-erh. This is 20th century

823
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:43,060
There simply aren't any ghosts

824
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:44,730
It's all your imagination

825
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:49,440
There is no ghost in the world. Listen to me

826
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:51,870
I already explained to you your mystery

827
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:52,810
Why a surgery for Siamese twins...

828
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:54,310
would have such impact on you?

829
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:55,940
Face the truth

830
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,740
It's just that you don't accept the reality

831
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:01,820
I've seen her with my own eyes more than once

832
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:04,950
I always feel that she is hovering around me

833
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:09,120
Yes, her death is indeed unfair;

834
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:12,090
since she died, not me

835
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,970
But now, haven't I lost everything?

836
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:21,300
This is fate. How could you fight against it?

837
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:23,140
It's not fate. It's human

838
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,210
Had they made a different decision...

839
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:27,170
Daddy and uncle Cheung won't be dead

840
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,250
Nothing would have happened...

841
01:01:28,350 --> 01:01:29,870
if I'd never have come back to Hong Kong

842
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:31,350
Po-erh, calm down

843
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:33,250
I am your doctor. Let me help you

844
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:34,280
How would you help me?

845
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:36,080
Yours is illusion. Mine is truth

846
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:37,710
What is the different between illusion and reality?

847
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:38,310
Po-erh

848
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:41,090
Anyway, you can't help me

849
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:42,820
Doctor, doctor...

850
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:44,260
Does a doctor always make correct decision?

851
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,730
Are you saying a doctor can't be wrong, huh?

852
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:48,990
Yes. I was saved by the operation,

853
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,030
but how about my sister?

854
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:53,570
She is gone and it's not fair

855
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:56,460
There isn't anything such as 'fair' in this world

856
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:00,910
I'd say don't dwell on it too much

857
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:02,240
It's easier said than done

858
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:04,870
Presently my father and uncle are dead

859
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:06,980
It's not related to you

860
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:09,940
You asked me out...

861
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:11,150
just to tell me not to think too much

862
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,510
I don't need your comfort

863
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:14,680
I just need you to trust me

864
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:18,460
Ok. You come to my clinic tomorrow

865
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:19,720
and I'll give you a body check

866
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:22,230
Bullshit!

867
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:24,430
Po-erh!

868
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:43,080
It seems someone is back home

869
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,310
Huh, someone's back home?

870
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,150
Hurry, put on the clothes

871
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:49,850
Where're my clothes?

872
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,760
Be quick, put this on

873
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:53,660
Hey, this isn't mine

874
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:54,660
Whatever!

875
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,730
Quick. Where is my sweater?

876
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:14,280
I... she is

877
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:17,550
Goodnight

878
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,250
Bonnie...

879
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,320
Do you want some food?

880
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:38,460
Wendy and I, actually...

881
01:06:42,890 --> 01:06:43,860
Where are you going?

882
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:07,620
Michael. Michael!

883
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:12,960
Michael, what are you doing?

884
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:29,630
Help, help me!

885
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:32,870
Michael, let go of her

886
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,160
Damn, how could I have killed him!

887
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:55,560
What shall we do?

888
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:00,660
Who are you calling?

889
01:08:00,770 --> 01:08:01,600
The police!

890
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:03,640
No, I'll be totally finished

891
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:09,570
Let's call doctor Poon

892
01:08:16,650 --> 01:08:19,520
Nobody? Come on!

893
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:25,760
Now what? C'mon, hurry up. Answer the phone

894
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:28,490
At this late an hour!

895
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:34,860
Why're your hands so cold? Sit down

896
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,500
I'll get you some hot tea

897
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:28,150
Po-erh! What are you doing?

898
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:33,950
Po-erh... what are you doing?

899
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:36,880
Po-erh, are you mad?

900
01:10:39,530 --> 01:10:44,370
Po-erh, don't!

901
01:10:44,970 --> 01:10:46,270
Po-erh

902
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:51,670
Po-erh, don't!

903
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:55,470
What are you doing? No

904
01:10:56,310 --> 01:10:57,910
Po-erh, are you crazy?

905
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:01,250
Po-erh

906
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:08,860
No...

907
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:11,890
You're not Po-erh. Who are you?

908
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:43,010
I can't get through

909
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:43,710
What then?

910
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:44,620
Never mind, let's just go there

911
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:45,450
Go over to his place?

912
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:46,720
Never mind, let's just go

913
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:22,120
Doctor Poon

914
01:14:23,190 --> 01:14:26,210
The door is open. Let's go in

915
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:34,790
What a mess!

916
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:36,090
Doctor Poon?

917
01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:19,930
What are you doing?

918
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:28,440
What's wrong?

919
01:15:30,350 --> 01:15:36,490
What's wrong? Doctor Poon

920
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,120
Wendy...

921
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:45,800
Bonnie

922
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:05,820
Help!

923
01:17:15,730 --> 01:17:19,290
Wendy...

924
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:29,140
Po-erh, why would I be like this?

925
01:17:30,010 --> 01:17:34,000
What's wrong with her? Tell me

926
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:38,040
What happened here? Please tell me

927
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:40,610
Tell me...

928
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:42,440
Chi-ching...

929
01:17:48,390 --> 01:17:55,560
Mommy, come play with me

930
01:17:56,530 --> 01:17:59,630
Daddy and uncle Cheung are not good at playing

931
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:02,570
Where is your father and sister?

932
01:18:02,870 --> 01:18:07,400
Mommy, come and stay with me!

933
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:09,570
Ok...

934
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:13,250
But you've to promise not to hurt your sister

935
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:42,800
Po-erh. You better leave

936
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:44,380
America, Canada or wherever

937
01:18:49,690 --> 01:18:50,810
You've to come along as well

938
01:18:56,090 --> 01:18:57,290
I'll book the tickets

939
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:00,460
I'm afraid mom wouldn't want to leave

940
01:19:00,930 --> 01:19:02,660
You must convince her

941
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:12,140
Mommy, we must leave this place

942
01:19:12,810 --> 01:19:17,080
Leave? We can't escape

943
01:19:18,950 --> 01:19:20,710
If you don't leave, then I'll stay here too

944
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:22,310
You'd better go as soon as possible

945
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:25,850
Mommy, I'm really scared!

946
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:36,960
Well, let's get our luggage packed

947
01:19:38,670 --> 01:19:41,190
Great. I'll go to take the flight tickets now

948
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:43,730
Wait for my call. Don't forget your passports

949
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:45,570
I'll go and complete the discharge formalities

950
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:54,040
Without delay we've to get moving

951
01:19:54,850 --> 01:19:55,550
I know

952
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:57,740
Po-erh

953
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:02,260
What is it, mom?

954
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,050
Po-erh

955
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:27,840
I know you're reluctant to leave Hong Kong

956
01:20:28,550 --> 01:20:29,810
But in Canada, I'll be there...

957
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:33,250
as well as auntie to keep you company, isn't it?

958
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:36,920
Then you'd better pack up quickly

959
01:20:37,030 --> 01:20:38,820
It's almost time for the flight

960
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:44,290
And you too, hurry up

961
01:21:23,470 --> 01:21:28,810
Bei-erh. Show up, dear. Mommy has to leave

962
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:36,080
Let me see you once again

963
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:42,890
You blame mommy, isn't it? Please show up

964
01:21:48,130 --> 01:21:51,000
Bei-erh. You come out now, honey

965
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:53,670
It isn't that mommy doesn't love you

966
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:59,040
You've grown up. You don't need me anymore

967
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:07,810
Bei-erh. Come to me

968
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:16,490
Mommy, you don't like me anymore...

969
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,090
Mommy, you don't like me

970
01:22:20,930 --> 01:22:26,700
But I won't let you go. You said you'll be with me

971
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:31,970
You always favor Po-erh. I'm also your daughter

972
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:51,320
Mommy! Mommy

973
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:21,190
Hey, where's auntie? It's getting late!

974
01:23:21,590 --> 01:23:22,820
The flight is about to depart

975
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:26,630
Where're the passports? What's wrong?

976
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:28,190
I have even got the plane tickets

977
01:23:30,630 --> 01:23:31,660
Doctor Poon!

978
01:23:35,170 --> 01:23:36,970
Chi-ching...
