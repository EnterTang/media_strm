73
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,570
最近怎样 老兄?

74
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,400
她不该带人来的
She's not to bring anyone.

75
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,660

89
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,140

Well, listen, we don't have to go today if you don't want to.

92
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,620
不 我们走 我-我想

你睡了几个小时了
You've been asleep for a couple of hours.

106
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,410
我做了个恶梦
I had this terrible dream.

107
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,850
什么内容?
What about?

108
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,090
不记得了
I don't remember.

109
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,850
要是我就不烦那个
I wouldn't worry.

110
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,190
因为恶梦能够释放现实中的压力
Apparently bad dreams cure you of real life stress.

111
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,280
这可是真正的香槟 要些吗?
As indeed does champagne. You want some?

112
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,340
是的
Yeah.

113
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,360

114
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,610
维多 我可是船长的客人 不过 好吧 我会帮你的
Actually, Victor, I'm a guest of the Captain's, but yes, I witt help you.

115
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,770
维多 在码头的时候是怎么回事?
Victor, what was that back there at the harbor?

116
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,280
什么?
What?

117
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,140
我问洁西是否还好的时候你说不
I asked Jess if she was all right and you said no.

118
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,710
你不是告诉我她会带小孩一起来的吗?
You told me she was bringing the little boy along.

119
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,620
可是跟她在一起的时候 我问她孩子在哪儿?
When I was walking with her in the harbor I asked where he was.

120
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,710
她却记不得了
She couldn't remember.

121
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,880
她愣了差不多20秒
She stared into space for like 20 seconds

122
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,020
然后说在学校
and then she said he's at school.

123
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,190
所以...?
So?

124
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,320
呃 今天是星期六 学校放假
Well, it's Saturday. Ain't no school today.

125
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,160
也许她儿子是上一所每天都上课的特殊学校
Her son goes to a special needs school and it's open every day.

126
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,530
对她好点
Be nice to her.

127
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,900
- 没问题 - 那就好
- All right. - All right.

128
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,240
你们一起晒日光浴吗?
Do you boys sunbathe together?

129
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,980
有时
Sometimes.

130
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:35,490
香槟算不上极品但够冰 要些吗?
The champagne is not great but it is cold. Want some?

131
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,520
不了 谢谢
No thanks.

132
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,480
好吧 那我自己多喝点
Okay, more for me.

133
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,820
嘿 感觉怎么样?
Hey, how are you feeling?

134
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,990
真抱歉 我真不知道怎么会累成这样
I'm sorry, I didn't realize how tired I was.

135
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,520
你又道歉 再这样的话我就把你扔出去
You apologize one more time, and I'm gonna throw you overboard.

136
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,000
来这儿
Here.

137
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,330
现在好些了吧?
You all right?

138
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,060
是的
Yeah.

139
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,080
它以为我们是渔船
He thinks we're a fishing hoat.

140
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,450
它饿了
He's gonna go hungry.

141
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,350
想掌舵么?
You want to steer?

142
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,890
不
Nah.

143
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,590
试试吧
Go on.

144
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,700
我应该往那个方向?
Which way do I aim?

145
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,760
往那个方向
You're gonna aim that way.

146
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,100
很简单 对不对?
It's easy, right?

147
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,200
就是说 有时候她会做服务生
So, she's a waitress at some diner.

148
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,880
他们很谈得来 要变成朋友了
At least there they talk. They became friends.

149
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,040
哦 她还有个孤僻的儿子
Oh, and she has an autistic son.

150
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,410
所以他们只不过是朋友
So they're just friends.

151
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,080
莎莉!
Sally!

152
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,880
怎么 我应该说什么? 她有那么个儿子我很难过?
What do you want me to say? I'm sorry she has a retarded son?

153
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,620
是啊!
Yeah!

154
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,090
喔 很难过 你知道 但那是她的问题 不是格雷的
Well, I'm sorry. You know, that's not Greg's problem, that's hers.

155
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,990
你为什么看不惯她 因为她的短裤?
What is it, is it the shorts?

156
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,060
不! 希德 格雷是我的老朋友了
No! Heather, Greg's been my friend for a really long time.

157
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,660
我不能坐视不管 眼睁睁看他背上麻烦
I can't just sit back and watch him get shaken down.

158
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,260
她又没有这样
She isn't doing that.

159
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,900
好吧 希望不会 因为格雷太容易相信人了
Well, I hope not because Greg is far too trusting.

160
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,940
我有点喜欢那小伙子了
I'm kinda linking the boy.

161
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:12,240
啊 不 你不要 你就不能上去跟格雷谈一谈?
Uh, no, you're not. Can you please go up there and talk to Greg?

162
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,280
我觉得你们两个真的很匹配
I really think the two of you will be perfect for each other.

163
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,640
而且我也实在看不惯他跟她在一起
And I really don't like seeing him with her.

164
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,980
洁西 好了吗?
Jess, are you ready?

165
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:24,150
好了 升上去吧
Yeah, let her go.

166
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,760
好的
Yeah.

167
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,330
哇哦!
Woo!

168
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,140
嗯 你是怎么认识这些人的?
So, how do you know everyone?

169
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,200
维多 他一直跟我在一起
Victor, he's staying with me for good.

170
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,440
他在家里有些麻烦不得不跑出来
He got in troubte at home. He had to get away.

171
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,970
我发现他的时候他正睡在码头的储藏室后面
I found him sleeping behind the store at the harbor.

172
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,110
我们很谈得来 现在他住在这儿
You know, we got talking, and now he lives here.

173
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,020
就因为那样你就让他搬进来?
Just like that you let him move in?

174
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,980
嗯 我有三个房间 反正用不了
Well, I got three rooms. I can't sleep in them all.

175
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,780
唐尼 孩子的时候我就认识他了
And Downey, I've known him since I was a kid.

176
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,620
莎莉 他老婆 高中时认识的
Sally, his wife, I know her from high school.

177
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,220
八年级的时候我跟她约会过大约四天
I dated her for like four days in the eighth grade,

178
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,730
所以她可以算是我的"前女友"
so technically she's my ex.

179
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,500
他们看起来人都挺好的
They seem really nice.

180
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:13,630
是的 除了每年他们都觉得有必要
Yeah. Except for the fact that every year they feel obliged

181
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:17,070
给我介绍个女朋友
to bring me an eligible girl.

182
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,370
或许他们觉得你太孤单了
Maybe they think you're lonely.

183
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,470
你觉得我看上去孤单吗?
Do I give off lonely to you?

184
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,240
有时
Sometimes.

185
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,040
在餐厅看到你的时候 我可不觉得孤单 只觉得饿
When I come to see you at the diner, I'm not lonely, I'm hungry.

186
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,380
不过昨天明显的不同
Obviously yesterday was different.

187
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,850
昨天怎么了?
What happened yesterday?

188
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,650
昨天我不饿
Yesterday I was not hungry.

189
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:38,490
昨天我去餐厅只有一个目的就是邀请你出来航海
I came in with the sole purpose of inviting you sailing.

190
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,930
是吗?
You did?

191
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,730
是的
I did.

192
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,000
左转舵 风力不够
Turn at port side. We're losing wind.

193
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,070
让我稍微来调整一下
Let me check it for]ust a sec.

194
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,190
嗯 汤米怎样?
So, things are okay with Tommy?

195
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,190
老样子
The same.

196
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,020
每天都是老样子
Every day is the same.

197
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,880
汤米喜欢固定的模式 是的
Tommy likes the things to be a certain way. Yeah.

198
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:10,620
要是我做的稍有不同 就会失掉他的欢心
If I do one thing differently, I lose him.

199
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:16,360
怎么了? 以前从没见你这样过
What's the matter? I've never seen you like this before.

200
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:20,460
我不知道 我只是 呃 只是不跟汤米待在一起觉得很不安
I don't know. I just, uh, I just feel guilty when I'm not with Tommy.

201
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,440
那说明你是个好妈妈
That's because you're a good mother.

202
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:26,470
但你不可能时时刻刻都跟他在一起
But you can't be everywhere all of the times.

203
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,100
嘿 两位 噢!
Hey, guys. Oh!

204
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,210
谈得怎样?
How is it going?

205
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,250
挺好的
We're good.

206
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,150
我想问问是不是可以把洁西从你身边"偷走"一会儿
I was]ust wondering if I could steal Jess away from you.

207
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,320
莎莉非常想跟她谈一谈
Salty's dying to tatk to her.

208
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:43,220
我们正说在兴头上呢
We're kind of in the middle of something right now.

209
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,320
没关系 没关系 我-我应该去一下
No, no, it's okay. I-I should circulate.

210
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,660
嘿 说真的
Hey, just for the record,

211
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,930
我无意打扰的
I'm not interested.

212
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,240
唷 怎么回事?
Yo, what the fuck?

213
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,780
我们这儿风减弱了
Wind's dropped down on us.

214
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,350
风团不是减弱了 是飘走了
It's not dropped, it's gone.

215
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,290
太让人吃惊了
This is crazy.

216
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,310
你以前碰上过这个吗?
You ever seen this before?

217
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,830
是的 是的 只是没这么快
Yeah, yeah. Just not quite so sudden.

218
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,160
我们还能回得去吗? 没有风了
Are we okay to get home? There is no wind.

219
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,770
当然 当然 我们可以靠引擎 那不是问题
Yeah, yeah. We got an engine. It's not a problem.

220
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:43,340
只是 有点怪
It's just, it's weird.

221
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,310
格雷?
Greg?

222
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,210
那正常吗?
Is that normal?

223
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,570
喔 我可搞糊涂了 这是他妈的怎么回事
Okay, I'm fucking freaked, what the fuck.

224
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,420

风  神  号

281
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,940
噢 感谢上帝
Oh, thank God.

282
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,920
跳过来 跳过来 跳过来
Jump, jump, jump.

283
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,890
没事的 洁西 过来 过来
Okay. Jess, come on, come on.

285
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,560
过来 过来 抓着我的手 好的
Come on, come on, take my hand. Okay.

286
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,770
好了 你还好吗?
Okay. You okay?

287
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,420
A 甲 板

288
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:23,830
A 甲 板

289
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:26,320
还好吗? 嗯?
You okay? Yeah?

290
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,330
嗯
Hey.

291
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,630
怎么了?
How is it?

292
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:37,290
看见人了吗? 明明有的
See? I told you.

293
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,640
有人吗?
Hello?

294
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,620
有人吗?
Hello?

295
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,520
有人吗!
Hello!

296
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,030
我们就这么待着吗?
Do we wait?

297
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,690
不 我们去舰桥
No, let's go to the bridge.

298
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,970
A 甲 板

299
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,600
我们去找船长 想法子给海岸警卫队打个电话
We'll get the captain to put a call out to the coast guard.

300
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,330
我们去找希德
We'll get a search for Heather.

301
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,530
走吧
Oome on.

302
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,010
你觉得希德会不会已经上来了?
Do you think Heather would've made it on board?

303
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,140
宝贝
Honey.

304
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,880
有这种可能 不是吗?
There's a chance, isn't there?

305
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,880
是的 是的 有这种可能
Yeah. Yeah, there's a chance.

306
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,920
保持过道畅通
每时每刻
六号门

307
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,920
长      廊

308
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,210
有人吗?
Hello?

309
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,350
有人吗?
Hello?

310
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,580
保持过道畅通
每时每刻
六号门

311
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,580
长      廊

312
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,390
有没有人!
Hello!

313
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:23,040
有没有人来帮帮我们?
Somebody please help us?

314
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,570
有人吗?
Hello?

315
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:42,860
人都他妈的去哪儿了?
Where the fuck is everybody?

316
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:46,420
我们这是要去哪儿
You don't even now where we're going.

317
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:49,970
喔 我们只是 只是...走走看吧
Well, we're just, just walking for the sake of it.

318
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,410
你还好吗?
You all right?

319
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,610
我觉得我来过这地方
I feel like I know this place.

320
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,080
我认得这走廊
I recognize this corridor.

321
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,880
游轮看上去都差不多
Liners, they look pretty similar.

322
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,400
不 不是这样
No, that's not it.

323
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,950
来看看这个
Come check this out.

324
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:25,830
就是这艘船 这是艘旧船
This is the same ship. This thing's old.

325
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,400
洁西
Jess.

326
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,970
走吧 走吧
Oome on. Oome on.

327
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,770
1932年 就是这艘船 我们就在这艘船上
1932. It's the same. Here's where we boarded.

328
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,900
噢 是的
Oh, yeah.

329
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:42,820
埃厄洛斯
Aeolus.

330
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,410
埃厄洛斯是希腊风神 也是西绪福斯的父亲
Aeolus was the Greek god of the winds and the father of Sisyphus,

331
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,760
就是那个被神责罚的人 把石头推上山
the man condemned by the gods to the task of pushing a rock up a mountain

332
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,760
再眼睁睁的看着它滚下来
and let it see roll back down again.

333
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,790
真实差劲的惩罚 他干了什么?
That's a shitty punishment. What did he do?

334
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:57,690
他欺骗了死神 不 他对死神做了承诺却没有遵守
He cheated Death. No, he made a promise to Death that he didn't keep.

335
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:02,100
我以前知道但现在记不清了 我们能不能不要管这个继续向前走?
I studied it but I can't remember. Can we just keep on moving, please?

336
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,600
谁啊?
Hello?

337
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,630
可能有人回来拿这个
Whoever it was might wanna come back for these.

338
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,530
让我看看?
Let me see?

339
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:41,130
这是我的
These are mine.

340
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,500
是我的钥匙
These are my keys.

341
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,010
你瞎说什么呢?
What are you talking about?

342
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,060
这是我的
They're mine.

343
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,500
胡扯
Bullshit.

344
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,670
这是 这是我家里的钥匙
This is, this is my house key.

345
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,810
这是我的 我的车钥匙 这是我儿子 看见了吗?
This is my, my car key. This is my son. See?

346
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:55,080
等等 就是说在我们游艇上的时候你就带着它们?
Wait. So you had them with you on the yacht?

347
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,240
是的
Yes.

348
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,510
肯定是希德
It's gotta be Heather.

349
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,650
得了吧
Come on.

350
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,520
还有谁会拿到这个?
How else did they get here?

351
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:05,420
希德难道会把钥匙扔在这儿却不出来说一声 "我没淹死"
It was Heather dropping her keys but not bothering to say, "I didn't drown."

352
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:06,720
为什么不会?
Why not?

353
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:11,400
走吧
Come on.

354
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,100
希德?
Heather?

355
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:33,950
看起来是碰上了一场盛宴 却没人出来迎接
Looks like you get your welcome party, just not the welcome.

356
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,590
希德!
Heather!

357
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,690
唷 格雷 你的表几点了?
Yo, Greg, what time you got?

358
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:48,100
十一点半
Eleven thirty.

359
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,110
希德
Heather.

360
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,810
希德!
Heather!

361
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,210
人都去哪儿了?
Where is everyone?

362
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:01,810
希德!
Heather!

363
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,040
莎莉! 好了 不要再叫了
Sally! Please. Please.

364
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:07,710
我不知道人都去哪儿了 但这肯定不是艘被废弃的船
I don't know where everyone is but the ship's not deserted.

365
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:11,420
我是说 我们当中可能有人认为它是 但它实际上不是
I mean, maybe some of us think that it is but it's not,

366
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,050
所以我们只需要到舰桥上去
so let's just go to the bridge.

367
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,460
找到船长 然后我们就可以回家了
We'll find the skipper and then we'll go home.

368
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,490
有人
I saw someone.

369
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,230
操
Fuck.

370
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,970
等等
Wait.

371
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,180
谁?
Hello?

372
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:54,130
你看清楚是谁了吗? 是不是希德?
Did you see who it was? Was it Heather?

373
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,790
我没看清
I didn't see.

374
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:59,600
对不起
I'm sorry.

375
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,140
你去哪儿?
Where're you going?

376
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,200
只是出去一下 不要管我好不好?
Why don't you just help me out here?

377
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,000
什么?
What?

378
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,840
待在这儿等维多
Just wait for Vic.

379
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,280
什么?
What?

380
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,340
没事的
It's fine.

381
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,980
我们为什么不一起去?
Why can't we go with him?

382
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:17,510
咱们就在这儿等维多 就照格雷说的办 好不好?
Let's just do as Greg says and wait here for Victor, okay?

383
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,680
好吧
Fine.

384
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,350
我觉得维多有危险
I think Victor's in danger.

385
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,660
我并不担心维多
I'm not worried about Victor.

386
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:25,720
对不起我可能表现的很怪异 可是我每转过一个拐角
I'm sorry I'm acting weird. It's just I'm having deja vu

387
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,450
都会觉得似曾相识
every time I turn a corner.

388
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:28,790
不不不
No, no. No.

389
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,340
我来过这地方
I know this place.

390
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,840
不 你没来过这地方 你只不过是吓坏了
No, you don't know this place. You're just in shock.

391
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,370
真搞笑
That's funny.

392
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,500
因为什么? 因为什么? 是因为汤米吗?
What is it? What is it? Is it Tommy?

393
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:40,380
离开他觉得不安? 是那样的吗? 你觉得不安?
Is it guilt? Is that what it is? Do you feel guilty?

394
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:05,230
有人吗?
Hello?

395
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:44,130
去 剧 院

396
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:49,100
有人吗
Hello.

397
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,650
有人吗?
Hello.

398
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:34,740
我们在三层 舰桥在正上方两层
We're on the third floor. The bridge is exactly two floors above us.

399
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:38,150
格雷 那是血 你就这么打算装看不见吗?
Greg, that was blood. Are you just gonna ignore it?

400
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,200
我了解那些在船上工作的家伙
I know guys that work on ships like this.

401
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:43,590
他们看见我们 觉得无聊 就想出这种鬼点子发泄他们的精力
They see us, they get bored. They're just letting off some steam.

402
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:47,650
什么? 你说他们把我们从海里救起来然后再躲起来恶作剧吗?
What? They rescue us from the sea and then they just hide for fun?

403
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,170
是的
Yeah.

404
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,210
嗯 你怎么看?
Well, what's your theory?

405
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,770
我不知道 但我不是 绝对不是吓傻了瞎说
I don't know, but I'm not, but I'm not in shock.

406
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,860
我要回宴会厅 我要下船
I'll be in the ball room. I'm getting off this ship.

407
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:01,440
洁西 操! 难道你不明白那些只是你在胡思乱想吗?
Jess, fuck! Don't you see that this is all just in your mind?

408
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,950
洁西! 船不是在哪儿都会突然冒出来的
Jess! Ships don't just magically appear out of nowhere.

409
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:09,620
它们有自己的航线 我是说 你脑袋里想的好像它们是乱窜的一样
They have skippers. I mean, in your world right now they don't.

410
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:18,150
我脑袋里想的是到学校门口去接孩子回家
My world is waiting outside school for his mother to pick him up.

411
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:21,400
别对我的想法说三道四
Don't talk to me about my world.

412
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,000
洁西 洁西 对不起
Jess. Jess, I'm sorry.

413
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,050
风 神

414
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,550
这是血吗?
Is that blood?

415
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:53,330
宝贝 别这样 我们得去剧场和别人会合
Babe, come on, we're supposed to meet them in the theater.

416
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,760
希德!
Heather!

417
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,460
通往酒店的宴会大厅

418
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:00,100
噢 天哪 可恶
Oh, my God. Shit.

419
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:02,500
莎莉 莎 别这样
Sally. Sal, come on.

420
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,940
咱们只需要去剧场等着

唐尼 没有血了 我觉得她不在这儿
Downey, I can't see anymore blood. I don't think she's in here.

423
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,420
跟你说实话 我觉得她根本就不在船上
To be honest with you, I don't think she's even on the ship.

424
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:29,460
是吗 那这些血是怎么回事?
Okay. So whose blood was that?

425
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,300
人呢?
Hello?

426
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:43,740
唐尼? 莎莉?
Downey? Sally?

427
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,330
维多 出什么事了?
Victor. What happened?

428
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,380
噢 天哪
Oh, my God.

429
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:14,630
撑住 格雷 撑住 老兄

00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,060
撑住 老兄
Stay with me, man.

你个臭婊子! 你对他开枪!
You fucking bitch! You shot him!

433
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,500

他说的你对他开枪
He said you shot him.

我根本没和他一起!
I wasn't even with Greg!

438
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:34,640
他死了! 死了! 看哪!
He's dead! He's dead! Look!

439
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,510
天哪 你个婊子!
God, you're a bitch!

440
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,830
把你的爪子从他身上拿开!
Get your hands off him!

441
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,590
我没杀死他! 我跟维多在一起
I didn't do it! I was with Victor.

442
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,170
有人袭击了他
Someone attacked him.

443
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,000
有人?
Someone?

444
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,570
你以为是我做的?
You think I did it?

445
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:57,160
为什么要我们来剧场?
Why did you tell us to come to the theater?

446
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:01,410
我没有 我... 莎莉 我没有
I didn't. L... Sally, I didn't.

447
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,000
我没有
I didn't.

448
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,550
天哪 你他妈的可真能装
My God, you're a fucking skitso.

449
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,010
莎莉 不

450
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,030

455
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,080
船 员 进 入

四号门

00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:24,490
上楼梯到救生艇

458
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,740
别开枪 求你了
Don't shoot. Please.

459
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,170
求你了 别开枪 别开枪
Please, don't shoot. Please.

460

我还有个儿子 我还有个儿子
I have a son. I have a son.

461
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,430
可恶
Shit.

463
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,320
你是谁?
Who are you?

464
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,190
你他妈的在说什么?
What the fuck are you saying?

465
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,460
这是回家的唯一方法
It's the only way to get home.

466
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:29,020

00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:31,130
你必须杀了他们
You have to kill them.

468
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:35,310
杀了他们! 杀了他们! 杀了他们!
Kill them! Kill them! Kill them!

00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:02,850

There, there. Over there. I can see somebody.

476
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:05,070
风 神 号

477
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:05,010
请帮帮我们!
Please!

478
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:40,990
有人吗?
Hello?

479
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,780
或许他们想搞个欢迎仪式
Looks like they decided to scratch the welcome.

480
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,650
我们去舰桥
Let's go to the bridge.

481
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,210
我们去找船长 想法子给海岸警卫队打个电话
We'll get the captain to put a call out to the coast guard.

482
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,960
有人吗!
Hello!

483
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,030
有人吗?
Hello?

484
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:17,180
人都他妈的去哪儿了?
Where the fuck is everybody?

485
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,390
我们这是要去哪儿?
Do you even know where we're going?

486
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:35,000
喔 我们只是 只是...走走看吧
Well, we're just, just walking for the sake of it.

487
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:40,670
你还好吗?
You all right?

488
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,340
我觉得我来过这地方
I feel like I know this place.

489
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:46,040
我认得这走廊
I recognize this corridor.

490
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,580
游轮看上去都很像
Liners, they look pretty similar.

491
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:52,210
不 不是这样的
No, that's not it.

492
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:55,780
洁西 走吧
Jess, come on.

493
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:58,450
就是这艘船 这是艘老家伙
This is the same ship. This thing's old.

494
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,860
是啊 1932年的
Yeah. 1932.

495
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:04,090
就是这艘船 我们就在这艘船上
It is the same. Here's where we boarded.

496
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,760
是的 埃厄洛斯
Yeah. Aeolus.

497
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:10,030
埃厄洛斯
Aeolus.

498
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:13,230
埃厄洛斯是希腊风神 也是西绪福斯的父亲
Aeotus was the Greek god of the winds and the father of Sisyphus,

499
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,600
就是那个被神责罚的人 把石头推上山
the man condemned by the gods to the task of pushing a rock up a mountain

500
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:18,540
再眼睁睁的看着它滚下来
only to have it roll back down again.

501
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:20,780
真实差劲的惩罚 他做错了什么?
That's a shitty punishment. What did he do?

502
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:24,480
他欺骗了死神 不 他对死神做了承诺却没有遵守
He cheated Death. No, he made a promise to Death that he didn't keep.

503
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:27,750
我以前知道但现在记不清了 我们能不能不要管这个继续向前走?
I studied him and I can't remember. Can we just keep on moving?

504
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,550
有人吗?
Hello?

505
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:44,660
希德?
Heather?

506
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:47,520
有人吗!
Hello!

507
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:52,460
希德!
Heather!

508
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:56,330
希德!
Heather!

509
00:46:56,410 --> 00:47:00,140
莎莉 别叫了 我不知道人都去哪儿了
Sally. Please. I don't know where everyone is.

510
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,810
但这肯定不是艘被废弃的船
But the ship's not deserted.

511
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,310
我是说 我们当中可能有人认为它是但它实际上不是
I mean, maybe some of us think that it is but it's not,

512
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:06,850
所以我们只需要到舰桥上去
so let's]ust go to the bridge.

513
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,910
找到船长 然后我们就可以回家了
We'll find the skipper and then we go home.

514
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:12,390
有人
I saw someone.

515
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:38,840
楼梯到船甲板

516
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:58,120
有人吗?
Hello?

517
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,770
有人吗
Hello.

518
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,710
操 你怎么跑的这么快?
Shit. How did you get here so fast?

519
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:23,310
维多 你得 你得听我说 我们时间不多了
Victor, you got, you gotta listen to me. We don't have much time.

520
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:25,050
哦 怎么了? 格雷呢?
Oh, what's going on? Where's Greg?

521
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:26,150
他死了
He's dead.

522
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:27,550
什么?
What?

523
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:29,450
不 我是说 他刚才死了 但现在还没死
No, I mean, he was dead. He's not dead now.

524
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:30,970
你说什么呢?
What are you saying?

525
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:34,660
楼下现在有另一个我
Downstairs right now is a copy of myself.

526
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:37,760
另一个 正跟格雷一起
Me, walking and talking with Greg.

527
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:40,770
什么啊
Right.

528
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:49,240
看那儿
There.

529
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:50,790
一群鸟
There's birds.

530
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:52,650
不 那是唐尼的尸体
No, that was Downey's body.

531
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:55,690
我刚从唐尼那儿过来 你怎么跑的这么快?
I just left Downey back there. How did you get here so fast?

532
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:58,150
我就是想给你说明白这个
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

533
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:12,330
不 唐尼刚才在这儿 他的尸体刚才在这儿
No. Downey was there. It was Downey's body.

534
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:17,300
刚刚船上到处都是尸体
There are bodies all over this ship.

535
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:21,280
你的尸体就在餐厅的地板上 脑袋上有个洞
Your body is on the floor at the restaurant with a hole in your head.

536
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:23,710
听着 我卖你个人情 好吧 ?
Listen, I'm gonna do you a favor, okay?

537
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,940
这事儿我不会跟其他人说的
I'm not gonna tell anyone about this.

538
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:30,390
这是真的 维多 我们必须马上下船
It's the truth. Victor, we gotta get off this ship right now.

539
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:32,460
你说现在有两个你
You're saying there's two of you now.

540
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:34,120
对
Yes.

541
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:35,710
而且我死在餐厅了
And I'm dead in the restaurant.

542
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:37,350
你被人杀了
You were killed.

543
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:41,200
好 所以 我死了 唐尼泡在水里 他也死了
Okay. So, I'm dead. Downey's in the water. He's dead, too.

544
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,360
莎莉呢?
Is Sally okay?

545
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:45,900
这样的话我会得出什么结论?
See where I'm going with this, right?

546
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,830
如果我们都死了 而且还有两个你
If we are dead and there's two of you,

547
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,900
那我们还怎么下船?
how are we all gonna get off this ship?

548
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:52,310
我们根本就不该上来
We should never have boarded this ship.

549
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:54,070
我知道有些什么不对
I knew something was wrong.

550
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:57,510
我不该坚持出航的 这样你们就不会出事了
I should've forced you to stay on the yacht and you'd all be alive.

551
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,710
我打算告诉你我觉得我现在活的好好的
I've gotta tell you I feel pretty alive right now.

552
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:03,980
很快你就会死了 那些真的发生过 以前发生过
Soon you're gonna be dead. Everything that happened to you, happened before.

553
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:06,820
真不敢相信我会谈论这些乱七八糟的东西
I can't even believe I'm talking this shit.

554
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:10,350
你会死的 然后是唐尼 莎莉和格雷
You will die and then, then Downey and Sally and then Greg.

555
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:28,170
那不会是我干的 不是我干的
I didn't do this. I didn't do it.

556
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:46,090
我们在三层
We're on the third level.

557
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:49,420
格雷 那是血 你就这么打算装看不见吗?
Greg, that was blood. You just gonna ignore it?

558
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:51,470
我了解那些在船上工作的家伙
I know guys that work on ships like this.

559
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,430
他们看见我们 觉得无聊 就想出这种鬼点子发泄他们的精力
They see us, they get bored. They're just letting off some steam.

560

01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:18,510
听着 坚持住
Listen, you gotta hold on.

704
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:20,120
我觉得还会再发生一次
I think it will return again.

705
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:24,250
我们的小艇 三角号 我想它会再来的
The yacht, the Triangle, I think it'll come back.

706
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:27,260
要是那样的话 我们就逃走 你和我一起
If it does, we'll escape, me and you together.

707
01:06:27,330 --> 01:06:30,140
我们一起上船逃走
We'll re-board it and escape.

708
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:33,500
求求你
Please.

709
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:38,870
不要伤害我
Don't hurt me.

710
01:06:38,970 --> 01:06:41,350
莎莉 我不会的
Sally, I'm not gonna hurt you.

711
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:45,180
只要你坚持住
If you hold on,

712
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,870
肯定会再见到唐尼的
you can see Downey again.

713
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:18,900
嘿 过来 来这儿
Hey, come on. Over here.

714
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:22,220
嘿 嘿 帮帮我们
Hey. Hey. Help.

715
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,910
人死光了就会重新开始
It returns when they're dead.

716
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:33,030
人死光了船就会再来
It returns when everyone's dead.

717
01:07:47,210 --> 01:07:49,550
你觉得希德 会不会在船上?
Do you think Heather woutd've made it on board?

718
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:50,840
宝贝
Honey.

719
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,510
有这种可能 不是吗?
There's a chance, isn't there?

720
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:54,550
是的 是的 有这种可能
Yeah. Yeah, there's a chance.

721
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:48,400
停下 你这东西
Stop this thing.

722
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:50,570
停下 你这该死的
Stop this fucking thing.

723
01:09:10,930 --> 01:09:12,980
停下
Please.

724
01:09:13,090 --> 01:09:15,460
我想回家
I wanna go home.

725
01:09:17,490 --> 01:09:19,760
我想回家
I wanna go home.

726
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:49,450
他死了 我是说 他刚才死了
He's dead. I mean, he was dead.

727
01:09:49,530 --> 01:09:51,660
但现在还没死
He's not dead now.

728
01:09:51,730 --> 01:09:54,030
我躲起来 看到了另一个自己
I was hiding and I saw this version of myself,

729
01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:57,890
她脸上有血 我杀了她
and she had blood on her face, and then I killed her.

730
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,800
就在船头那儿我杀了她
I killed her on the front of the ship.

731
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:01,810
听着 我卖你个人情 好吧?
Listen, I'm gonna do you a favor, okay?

732
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:04,070
这些话我不会告诉别人的
I'm not gonna tell anyone about this.

733
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:06,070
这是真的 你要相信我
It's the truth. You gotta listen to me.

734
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:08,470
不 我一个字也不想听你多说了
No, I'm not listening to another word you say.

735
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:12,380
你会死的 然后是格雷 然后是唐尼
You will die, and then Greg and then Downey.

736
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:46,040
别怕 维多 我能救你
Don't be scared, Victor. I can save you.

737
01:10:47,950 --> 01:10:50,440
我知道怎么能救你
I know how to save you.

738
01:12:05,420 --> 01:12:07,250
你应该吃点东西 宝贝
You should try and eat, babe.

739
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,170
洁西?
Jess?

740
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:26,130
老天 你怎么了?
Jesus, what happened to you?

741
01:12:26,210 --> 01:12:27,770
格雷呢?
Where's Greg?

742
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,440
格雷让我告诉你们在剧场会合
Greg told me to tell you we should meet in the theater.

743
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:33,210
这儿有个剧场?
There's a theater?

744
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:35,940
对 就在那边
Yes, it'just that way.

745
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:37,510
你去哪儿?
Where are you going?

746
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:39,280
我去那儿等你们
I'll see you there.

747
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:42,660
好吧 她现在可真把我搞糊涂了
Okay, she's really starting to freak me out now.

748
01:13:20,170 --> 01:13:22,500
难道你不明白那些只是你在胡思乱想吗?
Don't you see that this is all just in your mind?

749
01:13:22,570 --> 01:13:26,520
船不是在哪儿都会突然冒出来的他们有自己的航线
Ships don't]ust magically appear out of nowhere. They have skippers.

750
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,660
你脑袋里想的好像它们是到处乱窜的一样
In your world right now maybe they don't.

751
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:33,840
我脑袋里想的是到学校门口去接孩子回家
My wortd is waiting outside school for his mother to pick him up.

752
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:36,770
别对我的想法说三道四
Don't talk to me about my world.

753
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:39,950
洁西
Jess.

754
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:41,880
洁西 对不起
Jess, I'm sorry.

755
01:14:18,650 --> 01:14:20,920
嘿 嘿 嘿 嘿
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

756
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:22,960
呃
Okay.

757
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:25,720
别紧张 老兄
Take it easy, man.

758
01:14:25,790 --> 01:14:27,780
别紧张
Just take it easy.

759
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,630
我们做错了什么吗? 我们本来不是这船上的
What did we do? We're not part of this boat.

760
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:37,290
我们刚上来 明白吗? 我们只是到处走走 船上没人
We just got here, okay? We've been walking around. There's no one on it.

761
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:40,600
我可以马上就走 我会走的
I can go right now. I will go.

762
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:44,110
好吗? 别... 别紧张
Okay? Just... Just take it easy.

763
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:46,080
别紧张
Take it easy.

764
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:47,900
好吗?
Okay?

765
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:55,750
洁西?
Jess?

766
01:14:56,650 --> 01:14:58,910
洁西
Jess.

767
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:00,360
洁西 你在干什么?
Jess, what are you doing?

768
01:15:00,470 --> 01:15:04,920
这...这是什么? 为...你穿的什么东西?
Wha... what is this? Why... what are you wearing?

769
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,990
我不想让你看见我的脸
I don't want you to see my face.

770
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:08,620
为什么?
Why?

771
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:11,040
因为这不是我
Because this is not me.

772
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:14,830
我正在远离这儿某处的小艇上 和你在一起
I'm somewhere out there in the yacht and you're with me.

773
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:19,810
杀了你之后 我们会重新来过
And after I kill you, we'll return.

774
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:22,040
那样么?
Is that right?

775
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:27,050
我说 为-为什么 你不先放下枪?
You know, why-why don't you just put down the gun first?

776
01:15:27,150 --> 01:15:29,850
好吗? 来
Okay? Come on.

777
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:32,450
知道吗 你们死光了之后小船就会再回来
You see, the boat comes back when you're all dead.

778
01:15:32,530 --> 01:15:34,680
我做的正是以前发生过的事情
I've done everything exactly like before.

779
01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:37,620
但这次小船来的时候 我会准备好 等在那儿
But when the boat comes back, I'll be ready, I'll be waiting.

780
01:15:37,690 --> 01:15:42,070
我会等在登船的地方 阻止他们上来 即便是另一个我
I'll be on the landing bay. I won't let any of them board, even the other me.

781
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:44,500
我会让他们留在翻了的小艇上
I'll make them all stay on the upturned yacht.

782
01:15:44,570 --> 01:15:45,830
好的
Okay.

783
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:49,900
洁西 我们会照你说的做
Jess, we'll do whatever you want.

784
01:15:50,010 --> 01:15:53,370
好吗? 只是 只是先放下枪
Okay? Just, just put down the gun.

785
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:57,300
来
Come on.

786
01:15:57,380 --> 01:15:58,870
对不起

噢 天哪! 发生什么事了?
Oh, God! What happened?

790
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:08,050
是洁西干的
It was Jess.

791
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:11,860
你个臭婊子! 你对他开枪 他说你对他开枪
You fucking bitch! You shot him. He said you shot him.

792
01:16:11,930 --> 01:16:13,400
我根本没和他一起!
I wasn't even with Greg!

793
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,660
他死了! 他死了!
He's dead! He's dead!

794
01:16:17,370 --> 01:16:19,930
天哪 你他妈的可真能装
My God, you're a fucking skitso.

795
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:24,500

不要杀我
Don't kill me.

798
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:48,310
我还有个儿子
I have a son.

799
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:09,830

他们会回来的 你必须要杀死他们
They'll return. You have to kill them.

804
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,500
这是回家的唯一方法
It's the only way to get home.

805
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:21,050
你他妈的在说什么?
What the fuck are you saying?

806
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:23,670
这是救我们儿子的唯一方法
It's the only way to save our son.

807

你必须杀死他们
You have to kill them.

808
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:27,610

我给你买东西就是为了
What's fun in buying you things

811
01:23:33,190 --> 01:23:35,670
让你把它们扔在那该死的院子里吗!
if you're gonna leave them in the fucking garden!

812
01:23:35,790 --> 01:23:37,840
说这些我都说的烦透了 汤米
I'm sick of telling you this, Tommy.

813
01:23:37,990 --> 01:23:42,090
我不会再给你买玩具了 除非你能把手头上这些都整理好
I ain't buying you anymore toys if you can't look after the ones you've got.

814
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:50,000
又怎么了?
Now what?

815
01:23:53,370 --> 01:23:55,130

Just one day off is alt I ask. Just one fucking day off!

819
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:17,620
真不知道你怎么就不能跟个正常孩子一样画画
I don't know why you can't paint a picture like a normal kid.

820
01:24:17,690 --> 01:24:20,170
肯定是从你老爸那儿遗传的
You get this from your father.

821
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:22,500
他也是个混蛋
He was an asshole, too.

822
01:24:36,910 --> 01:24:38,540
可恶
Shit.

只是个恶梦 都过去了
It's all it was.

832
01:26:01,770 --> 01:26:05,060
恶梦让你觉得你看到了实际上不存在的东西
Bad dreams make you think you've seen things that you haven't.
