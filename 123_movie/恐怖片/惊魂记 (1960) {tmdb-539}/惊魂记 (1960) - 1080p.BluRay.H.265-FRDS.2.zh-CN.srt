00:33:34,871 --> 00:33:37,123
She isn't quite herself today.

307
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:41,752
You shouldn't have bothered.
l really don't have that much of an appetite.

308
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:45,297
Oh, l'm sorry.

309
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:50,928
l wish you could apologise for other people.

310
00:33:51,555 --> 00:33:53,264
Don't worry about it.

311
00:33:53,348 --> 00:33:56,934
But as long as you've fixed a supper,
we may as well eat it.

312
00:34:07,487 --> 00:34:11,991
lt might be nicer and warmer in the office.

313
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:28,132
Well, it stopped raining.

314
00:34:28,216 --> 00:34:30,760
Eating in an office is just too officious.

315
00:34:30,844 --> 00:34:31,927
(CHUCKLES)

316
00:34:32,012 --> 00:34:34,722
-l have the parlour back here.
-All right.

317
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:52,865
-Sit down.
-Thank you.

318
00:34:56,203 --> 00:34:58,037
You're very kind.

319
00:34:59,372 --> 00:35:02,374
lt's all for you. l'm not hungry. Go ahead.

320
00:35:09,049 --> 00:35:11,217
You... You eat like a bird.

321
00:35:12,761 --> 00:35:14,804
And you'd know, of course.

322
00:35:15,555 --> 00:35:17,097
No, not really.

323
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:20,559
Anyway, l hear the expression
"Eats like a bird"

324
00:35:20,644 --> 00:35:24,730
is really a false... Falsity.

325
00:35:25,649 --> 00:35:28,526
Because birds really eat a tremendous lot.

326
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:34,698
But l don't really know
anything about birds.

327
00:35:34,783 --> 00:35:36,617
My hobby is stuffing things.

328
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,536
You know, taxidermy.

329
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:42,581
And l guess
l'd just rather stuff birds because

330
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:45,835
l hate the look of beasts
when they're stuffed.

331
00:35:45,919 --> 00:35:47,878
You know, foxes and chimps.

332
00:35:47,963 --> 00:35:51,882
Some people even stuff dogs and cats,
but, oh, l can't do that.

333
00:35:52,467 --> 00:35:54,885
l think only birds look
well stuffed because...

334
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:58,430
Well, because they're
kind of passive to begin with.

335
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:01,892
lt's a strange hobby. Curious.

336
00:36:02,602 --> 00:36:05,354
-Uncommon, too.
-Oh, l imagine so.

337
00:36:05,981 --> 00:36:09,441
And it's not as expensive as you'd think.
lt's cheap, really.

338
00:36:09,526 --> 00:36:12,069
You know, needles and thread, sawdust.

339
00:36:12,153 --> 00:36:14,905
The chemicals are the only thing
that cost anything.

340
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,074
A man should have a hobby.

341
00:36:17,784 --> 00:36:21,662
Well, it's... lt's more than a hobby.

342
00:36:23,832 --> 00:36:27,042
A hobby's supposed to pass the time,
not fill it.

343
00:36:27,836 --> 00:36:29,753
ls your time so empty?

344
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:30,963
No.

345
00:36:32,674 --> 00:36:34,925
Well, l run the office

346
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:37,428
and tend the cabins and grounds

347
00:36:37,512 --> 00:36:40,222
and do little errands for my mother.

348
00:36:40,307 --> 00:36:43,642
The ones she allows
l might be capable of doing.

349
00:36:44,227 --> 00:36:46,353
Do you go out with friends?

350
00:36:49,316 --> 00:36:52,234
Well, a boy's best friend is his mother.

351
00:36:54,529 --> 00:36:58,449
You've never had an empty moment
in your entire life, have you?

352
00:37:00,493 --> 00:37:03,662
-Only my share.
-Where are you going?

353
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:08,542
l didn't mean to pry.

354
00:37:08,627 --> 00:37:11,045
l'm looking for a private island.

355
00:37:12,422 --> 00:37:14,798
What are you running away from?

356
00:37:17,344 --> 00:37:19,386
-Why do you ask that?
-l don't know.

357
00:37:21,348 --> 00:37:23,974
People never run away from anything.

358
00:37:26,686 --> 00:37:30,314
The rain didn't last long, did it?
You know what l think?

359
00:37:31,524 --> 00:37:33,108
l think that

360
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,821
we're all in our private traps,

361
00:37:38,531 --> 00:37:41,867
clamped in them,
and none of us can ever get out.

362
00:37:44,245 --> 00:37:46,455
We scratch and claw,

363
00:37:47,248 --> 00:37:50,084
but only at the air, only at each other.

364
00:37:50,961 --> 00:37:54,546
And for all of it, we never budge an inch.

365
00:37:55,715 --> 00:37:58,926
Sometimes we deliberately step
into those traps.

366
00:38:01,262 --> 00:38:04,348
l was born in mine. l don't mind it any more.

367
00:38:04,432 --> 00:38:07,101
Oh, but you should. You should mind it.

368
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:09,395
Oh, l do, but l say l don't.

369
00:38:12,607 --> 00:38:16,568
You know, if anyone ever
talked to me the way l heard,

370
00:38:17,237 --> 00:38:19,405
the way she spoke to you...

371
00:38:21,282 --> 00:38:24,201
Sometimes when she talks to me like that,

372
00:38:24,786 --> 00:38:29,248
l feel l'd like to go up there
and curse her and leave her forever.

373
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:31,750
Or at least defy her.

374
00:38:36,423 --> 00:38:38,173
But l know l can't.

375
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:41,260
She's ill.

376
00:38:41,761 --> 00:38:43,595
She sounded strong.

377
00:38:44,723 --> 00:38:46,432
No, l mean ill.

378
00:38:48,685 --> 00:38:52,354
She had to raise me all by herself,
after my father died.

379
00:38:52,439 --> 00:38:56,025
l was only five and it must've been
quite a strain for her.

380
00:38:56,109 --> 00:38:58,569
l mean, she didn't have to go to work
or anything like that.

381
00:38:58,653 --> 00:39:00,779
He left her a little money.

382
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:05,117
Anyway, a few years ago,
Mother met this man.

383
00:39:05,702 --> 00:39:08,954
And he talked her into building this motel.

384
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:11,373
He could have talked her into anything.

385
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:15,711
And when he died, too,
it was just too great a shock for her.

386
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:19,048
And the way he died...

387
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,092
(CHUCKLES)

388
00:39:22,469 --> 00:39:25,721
l guess it's nothing to talk
about while you're eating.

389
00:39:25,805 --> 00:39:30,267
Anyway, it was just too great a loss for her.
She had nothing left.

390
00:39:31,978 --> 00:39:33,437
Except you.

391
00:39:34,898 --> 00:39:37,983
Well, a son is a poor substitute for a lover.

392
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:40,819
Why don't you go away?

393
00:39:42,363 --> 00:39:44,656
To a private island, like you?

394
00:39:46,993 --> 00:39:48,077
(SlGHS)

395
00:39:48,161 --> 00:39:50,662
No, not like me.

396
00:39:51,706 --> 00:39:54,833
l couldn't do that. Who'd look after her?

397
00:39:56,377 --> 00:39:58,462
She'd be alone up there.

398
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:01,256
Her fire would go out.

399
00:40:02,008 --> 00:40:04,510
lt'd be cold and damp like a grave.

400
00:40:06,096 --> 00:40:07,846
lf you love someone,

401
00:40:07,931 --> 00:40:11,183
you don't do that to them,
even if you hate them.

402
00:40:12,185 --> 00:40:14,728
You understand, l don't hate her.

403
00:40:16,606 --> 00:40:18,649
l hate what she's become.

404
00:40:19,651 --> 00:40:21,443
l hate the illness.

405
00:40:22,862 --> 00:40:25,572
Wouldn't it be better if you put her

406
00:40:27,283 --> 00:40:28,867
someplace...

407
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:35,249
You mean an institution? A madhouse?

408
00:40:39,379 --> 00:40:42,881
People always call a madhouse
"someplace," don't they?

409
00:40:42,966 --> 00:40:45,050
Put her in someplace.

410
00:40:46,553 --> 00:40:49,596
l'm sorry.
l didn't mean it to sound uncaring.

411
00:40:50,515 --> 00:40:52,933
What do you know about caring?

412
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:56,145
Have you ever seen the inside
of one of those places?

413
00:40:56,229 --> 00:40:58,480
The laughing and the tears

414
00:40:59,232 --> 00:41:02,025
and the cruel eyes studying you.

415
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:03,819
My mother there?

416
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,906
(CHUCKLES) But she's harmless.

417
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:13,745
She's as harmless
as one of those stuffed birds.

418
00:41:14,914 --> 00:41:16,248
l am sorry.

419
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:21,044
l only felt... lt seems she's hurting you.

420
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:25,674
-l meant well.
-People always mean well.

421
00:41:26,926 --> 00:41:29,219
They cluck their thick tongues
and shake their heads

422

and suggest, oh, so very delicately.

423
00:41:39,355 --> 00:41:41,940
Of course, l've suggested it myself.

424
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:46,069
But l hate to even think about it.

425
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:48,322
She needs me.

426
00:41:52,535 --> 00:41:54,703
lt's not as if she were

427
00:41:54,787 --> 00:41:57,581
a maniac, a raving thing.

428
00:42:00,126 --> 00:42:03,045
She just goes a little mad sometimes.

429
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:08,508
We all go a little mad sometimes.

430
00:42:11,221 --> 00:42:12,638
Haven't you?

431
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:15,849
Yes.

432

Sometimes just one time can be enough.

433
00:42:21,648 --> 00:42:22,981

Oh, you're not going back
to your room already?

all the way back to Phoenix.

l stepped into a private trap back there

441
00:42:44,712 --> 00:42:48,465
and l'd like to go back
and try to pull myself out of it

l'll bring you some breakfast, all right?

An old woman. His mother.

770
01:20:28,641 --> 01:20:31,684
Well, anyway, that was early this evening.
We haven't seen or heard from him since.

771
01:20:31,769 --> 01:20:35,271
Now, your sister's missing how long?

772
01:20:35,356 --> 01:20:38,525
Well, she left Phoenix a week ago yesterday,
without a trace.

773
01:20:38,609 --> 01:20:42,111
How'd you and this detective
come to trace her to Fairvale?

774
01:20:42,196 --> 01:20:44,364
They thought she'd be coming to me.

775
01:20:44,448 --> 01:20:46,783
-Left Phoenix under her own steam?
-Yes.

776
01:20:46,867 --> 01:20:49,452
She's not missing so much
as she's run away.

777
01:20:49,537 --> 01:20:51,788
-SAM: That's right.
-From what?

778
01:20:54,792 --> 01:20:57,335
-She stole some money.
-SHERlFF: A lot?

779
01:20:59,380 --> 01:21:00,713
$40,000.

780
01:21:01,298 --> 01:21:02,882
And the police haven't been able to...

781
01:21:02,967 --> 01:21:06,803
Everyone concerned thought if they
could get her to give the money back,

782
01:21:06,887 --> 01:21:09,347
they could avoid involving her
with the police.

783
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:13,351
That explains the private detective.
He traced her to the Bates place.

784
01:21:13,435 --> 01:21:15,895
What exactly did he say
when he called you?

785
01:21:15,980 --> 01:21:19,774
Well, he said that Marion was there
for one night and then she left.

786
01:21:19,858 --> 01:21:21,568
With the $40,000?

787
01:21:22,278 --> 01:21:24,404
Well, he didn't say anything
about the money.

788
01:21:24,488 --> 01:21:26,906
lt isn't important what
he said on the phone, is it?

789
01:21:26,991 --> 01:21:28,575
He was supposed to come back here
and talk to us

790
01:21:28,659 --> 01:21:30,743
after he talked to the mother, and he didn't.

791
01:21:30,828 --> 01:21:33,037
That's what l want you
to do something about.

793
01:21:35,499 --> 01:21:37,125
l'm sorry if l seem overanxious.

794
01:21:37,209 --> 01:21:40,920
lt's just that l'm sure there's something
wrong out there and l have to know what.

795
01:21:41,005 --> 01:21:44,465
Well, l think there's something wrong
too, miss, but not the same thing.

796
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:47,719
l think what's wrong is
your private detective.

797
01:21:47,803 --> 01:21:51,764
l think he got himself a hot lead
as to where your sister was going,

798
01:21:51,849 --> 01:21:53,933
probably from Norman Bates,

799
01:21:54,018 --> 01:21:58,229
and called you to keep you still
while he took off after her and the money.

800
01:21:58,314 --> 01:22:02,150
No, no, he said he was dissatisfied
and he was going back there.

801
01:22:02,234 --> 01:22:04,611
Why don't you call Norman
and let him say just what happened?

802
01:22:04,695 --> 01:22:06,070
SHERlFF: At this hour?

803
01:22:06,155 --> 01:22:08,364
Well, he was out
when l was there just a while ago.

804
01:22:08,449 --> 01:22:10,491
lf he's back,
he probably isn't even in bed yet.

805
01:22:10,576 --> 01:22:12,118
He wasn't out when you were there,

806
01:22:12,202 --> 01:22:15,538
he just wasn't answering the door
in the dead of night, like some people do.

807
01:22:15,623 --> 01:22:17,874
This fellow lives like a hermit.

808
01:22:17,958 --> 01:22:21,085
You must remember that bad business
out there about 1 0 years ago.

stop by there tonight...

a customer, anyway.

Norman told him about the girl,

822
01:23:14,932 --> 01:23:17,809
the detective thanked him
and he went away.

823
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:21,813
And he didn't come back?
He didn't see the mother?

824
01:23:21,897 --> 01:23:24,148
Your detective told you
he couldn't come right back

825
01:23:24,233 --> 01:23:28,111
because he was going to question
Norman Bates' mother, right?

Yes.

Are you sure you saw an old woman?

Yes! ln the house behind the motel!

but she just ignored me!

You want to tell me
you saw Norman Bates' mother?

843

But it had to be
because Arbogast said so, too!

see her because she was too ill.

Don't bother yourself. We'll find it.

931
01:30:37,999 --> 01:30:39,792
Sam, we have to go into that cabin
and search it,

932
01:30:39,876 --> 01:30:43,379
no matter what we're afraid of finding

But if you had a useless
business like this motel,

937
01:30:51,513 --> 01:30:52,680
what would you need to get out?

How could we prove that...

941
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:03,774
Well, if he opens a motel on
the new highway in, say, a year...

942
01:31:03,859 --> 01:31:06,360
There must be some proof that exists now,

943
01:31:06,444 --> 01:31:09,989
something that proves he got that money
away from Marion somehow.

944
01:31:10,073 --> 01:31:14,243
-What makes you sound so certain?
-Arbogast. He liked me, Sam.

945
01:31:14,744 --> 01:31:18,247
Or he felt sorry for me and he was
beginning to feel the same way about you.

946

l could tell the last time
l talked to him on the phone.

947
01:31:21,126 --> 01:31:22,459
He wouldn't have gone anywhere

948
01:31:22,544 --> 01:31:25,254
or done anything without telling us,
unless he was stopped.

949
01:31:25,338 --> 01:31:29,175
And he was stopped.
So he must have found out something.

Some figure has been added to

-lt'd be too wild a coincidence...
-Bates never denied she was here.

959
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:20,119
Well, doesn't that prove that he found out
about the money?

960
01:33:20,203 --> 01:33:21,912
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?

No.

962

she told Arbogast something.

One of us can keep him occupied
while the other gets to the old woman.

967

You'll never be able to hold him still
if he doesn't want to be held.

968

-l don't like you going into that house alone.
-l can handle a sick old woman.

All right, l'll find Bates
and keep him occupied.

-Oh, it's fine.

extreme reaction, don't you?

986
01:36:10,415 --> 01:36:11,957
Just an expression.

l'd do just about anything to get away.

lf you drag that swamp somewhere

1038
01:42:49,772 --> 01:42:52,858
Have you any unsolved missing
persons cases on your books?

1039

-Yes, two.
-Young girls?

-Did he confess to...
-Like l said, the mother.

1041
01:43:02,118 --> 01:43:05,871
Now, to understand it the way l understood
it, hearing it from the mother,

1042
01:43:06,455 --> 01:43:09,708
that is, from the mother half
of Norman's mind,

1043
01:43:10,293 --> 01:43:12,711
you have to go back 1 0 years

1044
01:43:13,170 --> 01:43:16,548
to the time when Norman murdered
his mother and her lover.

1045
01:43:16,632 --> 01:43:21,511
Now, he was already dangerously disturbed,
had been ever since his father died.

1046
01:43:22,555 --> 01:43:26,182
His mother was a clinging,
demanding woman,

1047
01:43:27,685 --> 01:43:32,397
and for years the two of them lived
as if there was no one else in the world.

1048
01:43:32,815 --> 01:43:34,608
Then she met a man,

1049
01:43:35,109 --> 01:43:38,945
and it seemed to Norman
that she threw him over for this man.

1050
01:43:39,697 --> 01:43:43,408
Now, that pushed him over the line
and he killed them both.

1051
01:43:43,993 --> 01:43:47,746
Matricide is probably the most
unbearable crime of all,

1052
01:43:49,206 --> 01:43:52,167
most unbearable to the son who commits it.

1053
01:43:53,169 --> 01:43:57,964
So he had to erase the crime,
at least in his own mind.

1054
01:44:01,010 --> 01:44:02,802
He stole her corpse.

1055
01:44:05,348 --> 01:44:07,682
A weighted coffin was buried.

1056
01:44:08,434 --> 01:44:11,019
He hid the body in the fruit cellar,

1057
01:44:11,479 --> 01:44:14,356
even treated it to keep it
as well as it would keep.

1058
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:16,650
And that still wasn't enough.

1059
01:44:17,443 --> 01:44:21,071
She was there, but she was a corpse.

1060
01:44:23,616 --> 01:44:26,409
So he began to think and speak for her,

1061
01:44:26,494 --> 01:44:29,037
give her half his life, so to speak.

1062
01:44:29,664 --> 01:44:33,708
At times he could be both personalities,
carry on conversations.

1063
01:44:34,794 --> 01:44:38,296
At other times,
the mother half took over completely.

1064
01:44:38,756 --> 01:44:43,551
He was never all Norman,
but he was often only Mother,

1065
01:44:44,971 --> 01:44:48,348
and because he was
so pathologically jealous of her,

1066
01:44:48,808 --> 01:44:51,267
he assumed that she was as jealous of him.

1067
01:44:51,352 --> 01:44:55,897
Therefore, if he felt a strong
attraction to any other woman,

1068
01:44:56,899 --> 01:44:59,651
the mother side of him would go wild.

1069
01:45:02,947 --> 01:45:04,990
When he met your sister,

1070
01:45:06,367 --> 01:45:08,660
he was touched by her, aroused by her.

1071
01:45:08,744 --> 01:45:10,245
He wanted her.

1072
01:45:12,415 --> 01:45:16,543
That set off the jealous mother,
and Mother killed the girl.

1073
01:45:18,087 --> 01:45:21,798
After the murder,
Norman returned as if from a deep sleep,

1074
01:45:22,383 --> 01:45:26,302
and, like a dutiful son,
covered up all traces of the crime

1075
01:45:26,387 --> 01:45:29,014
he was convinced
his mother had committed!

1076
01:45:29,098 --> 01:45:31,433
Why was he dressed like that?

1077
01:45:31,892 --> 01:45:33,768
He's a transvestite.

1078
01:45:34,770 --> 01:45:36,271
Not exactly.

1079
01:45:36,897 --> 01:45:40,316
A man who dresses in women's clothing
in order to achieve a sexual change

1080
01:45:40,401 --> 01:45:42,861
or satisfaction is a transvestite.

1081
01:45:42,945 --> 01:45:47,449
But in Norman's case,
he was simply doing everything possible

1082
01:45:47,533 --> 01:45:51,036
to keep alive the illusion
of his mother being alive.

1083
01:45:52,329 --> 01:45:54,873
And when reality came too close,

1084
01:45:54,957 --> 01:45:58,501
when danger or desire
threatened that illusion,

1085
01:46:00,838 --> 01:46:03,965
he'd dress up,
even to a cheap wig he bought.

1086
01:46:04,050 --> 01:46:08,178
He'd walk about the house,
sit in her chair, speak in her voice.

1087
01:46:08,262 --> 01:46:10,472
He tried to be his mother.

1088
01:46:12,391 --> 01:46:15,060
And now he is.

1089
01:46:16,979 --> 01:46:20,231
That's what l meant when l said
l got the story from the mother.

1090
01:46:20,316 --> 01:46:23,568
You see, when the mind
houses two personalities,

1091
01:46:24,153 --> 01:46:26,821
there's always a conflict, a battle.

1092
01:46:27,782 --> 01:46:30,575
ln Norman's case, the battle is over,

1093
01:46:31,410 --> 01:46:33,828
and the dominant personality has won.

1094
01:46:33,913 --> 01:46:36,706
And the $40,000? Who got that?

1095
01:46:37,875 --> 01:46:41,544
The swamp.
These were crimes of passion, not profit.

1096
01:46:43,798 --> 01:46:47,509
He feels a little chill.
Can l bring him this blanket?

1097
01:46:47,593 --> 01:46:49,552
-Oh, sure.
-All right.

1098
01:47:01,941 --> 01:47:03,316
(NORMAN AS MRS. BATES) Thank you.

1099
01:47:10,950 --> 01:47:14,202
MRS. BATES: lt's sad when a mother
has to speak the words

1100
01:47:14,286 --> 01:47:16,287
that condemn her own son,

1101
01:47:16,372 --> 01:47:20,208
but I couldn't allow them to believe
that I would commit murder.

1102
01:47:20,292 --> 01:47:24,129
They'll put him away now,
as l should have years ago.

1103
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:26,965
He was always bad,

1104
01:47:27,049 --> 01:47:32,095
and in the end he intended to tell them
l killed those girls and that man,

1105
01:47:32,179 --> 01:47:35,890
as if l could do anything
exceptjust sit and stare,

1106
01:47:35,975 --> 01:47:38,393
like one of his stuffed birds.

1107
01:47:39,145 --> 01:47:42,647
They know l can't even move a finger,
and I won't.

1108
01:47:42,731 --> 01:47:48,361
l'll just sit here and be quiet,
just in case they do suspect me.

1109
01:47:51,365 --> 01:47:54,617
They're probably watching me.
Well, let them.

1110
01:47:55,202 --> 01:47:58,037
Let them see what kind of a person l am.

1111
01:47:59,248 --> 01:48:01,666
l'm not even gonna swat that fly.

1112
01:48:01,750 --> 01:48:04,502
l hope they are watching. They'll see.

1113
01:48:05,004 --> 01:48:06,671
They'll see and they'll know,

1114
01:48:06,755 --> 01:48:11,259
and they'll say,
"Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly."
