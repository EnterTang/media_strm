1
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,417
I love money.

2
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:46,837
I love money more than I love
the things it can buy.

3
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,841
Does that surprise you?

4
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:54,094
Money. It don't care whether
I'm good or not.

5
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,972
It don't care whether I snore or not.

6
00:00:57,098 --> 00:01:00,017
It don't care which god I pray to.

7
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:05,940
There are only three things in this world
with that kind of unconditional acceptance.

8
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,483
Dogs...

9
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,901
...doughnuts...

10
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:10,569
...and money.

11
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:12,779
Only money is better.

12
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:15,032
You know why?

13
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:16,909
Because it don't make you fat...

14
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:20,621
...and it don't poop all over
the living-room floor.

15
00:01:21,163 --> 00:01:24,666
There's only one thing I like better:

16
00:01:26,293 --> 00:01:29,379
Other people's money.

17
00:01:50,567 --> 00:01:52,610
Hey, guys.

18
00:01:52,777 --> 00:01:54,445
Come on.

19
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,431
All right. Now, squeeze in over here.

20
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:27,186
That's it. I've got to see all your faces.

21
00:02:32,358 --> 00:02:34,902
- How you doing, Tom?
- Happy Thanksgiving, Jorgy!

22
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,488
Happy Thanksgiving, everybody!

23
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:42,951
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Smile, everybody!

24
00:02:43,118 --> 00:02:46,829
Take a good one, Elton.
The stock is up another point and a half!

25
00:03:00,052 --> 00:03:01,887
Somebody's up to something, Jorgy.

26
00:03:02,095 --> 00:03:04,972
Good news. Stock is up.
Don't worry about it.

27
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:08,059
- Gus, you got your teeth in?
- Ready now!

28
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,019
Cheeks up!

29
00:03:10,186 --> 00:03:12,771
New England Wire and Cable!

30
00:03:12,897 --> 00:03:16,525
New England Wire and Cable!

31
00:03:20,113 --> 00:03:22,031
Up two points.

32
00:03:22,198 --> 00:03:25,743
Wire and Cable up two points.

33
00:03:31,582 --> 00:03:33,792
Wire and Cable up two points.

34
00:03:49,225 --> 00:03:51,852
- Morning, Mr. Garfield.
- Good morning, Arthur.

35
00:03:51,977 --> 00:03:55,855
Say good morning to Carmen. She's
very happy today, aren't you, my sweet?

36
00:03:56,023 --> 00:03:57,315
Good morning, Carmen.

37
00:03:57,483 --> 00:04:00,986
- Cranberry juice is fresh today, boss.
- Oh, good.

38
00:04:02,196 --> 00:04:04,406
You never let me down, Arthur.

39
00:04:04,573 --> 00:04:05,865
You never let me down.

40
00:04:38,398 --> 00:04:41,651
- Good morning, sir.
- Samuels.

41
00:04:42,986 --> 00:04:45,446
- Good morning, Mr. Garfield.
- Good morning, Mr. Garfield.

42
00:04:47,323 --> 00:04:49,324
- Good morning, Mr. Garfield.
- Good morning.

43
00:04:49,534 --> 00:04:51,994
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Garfield.

44
00:04:52,161 --> 00:04:54,121
- Good morning, Mr. Garfield.
- Good morning.

45
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,207
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Garfield.

46
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,293
Work, work!

47
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,176
- Good morning, Mr. Garfield.
- Morning.

48
00:05:07,426 --> 00:05:09,052
- Good morning, Mr. Garfield.
- Yeah.

49
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,430
Good morning, Mr. Garfield.
You look nice today.

50
00:05:11,597 --> 00:05:14,891
I'm not paying you to be polite, Harriet.
What's happening?

51
00:05:15,017 --> 00:05:18,270
- Good morning, Mr. Garfield.
- Good morning, Mr. Garfield.

52
00:05:18,437 --> 00:05:20,480
Morning. Morning.

53
00:05:20,773 --> 00:05:22,691
Mr. Holt wants to see you for dinner...

54
00:05:22,816 --> 00:05:26,611
...and the Overly brothers will fly you
to Texas or come here, whichever you want.

55
00:05:27,321 --> 00:05:29,156
When I die, put it on my gravestone:

56
00:05:29,364 --> 00:05:32,325
- "He never went to Texas."
- Yes, sir. I'll call the engraver.

57
00:05:32,492 --> 00:05:34,702
- Where's the cinnamon?
- Out of cinnamon.

58
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,580
If I can't count on Dunkin' Donuts...

59
00:05:36,788 --> 00:05:39,749
...who do I count on?
- Well, you can count on me, sir.

60
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,419
Granger, Trundel Canning. Tell me.

61
00:05:42,586 --> 00:05:44,838
Trundel is being sued
by the townspeople, sir.

62
00:05:45,046 --> 00:05:48,466
Failed to comply
with environmental restrictions.

63
00:05:48,925 --> 00:05:52,011
And there are claims of illness
from the citizenry.

64
00:05:52,137 --> 00:05:53,847
Good.

65
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,932
Just before they're carted off to jail,
make a bid.

66
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,060
- Yes, sir.
- Angeli.

67
00:05:59,227 --> 00:06:02,271
- Yo.
- Eastern Motels. Outstanding shares.

68
00:06:03,148 --> 00:06:05,984
Six million, Mr. Garfield.
Slate owns 2 and a half million.

69
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,443
Mr. Morganstern wants to talk to you.

70
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:10,320
I'd rather talk to my mother.

71
00:06:10,488 --> 00:06:12,323
- Pfeiffer!
- Yeah.

72
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,783
What about this
New England Wire and Cable?

73
00:06:14,951 --> 00:06:17,536
It's too beautiful.
Is it booby-trapped?

74
00:06:18,037 --> 00:06:20,080
I...

75
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:22,708
I...

76
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,918
I...

77
00:06:25,086 --> 00:06:26,670
I...

78
00:06:27,046 --> 00:06:32,176
...can't seem to find any problems,
Mr. Garfield.

79
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:35,054
Neither can I.

80
00:06:35,221 --> 00:06:36,555
- Richardson.
- Yes, sir.

81
00:06:36,722 --> 00:06:37,973
Let's talk to these people.

82
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,100
Call the man in charge,
whoever he is.

83
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:41,977
Yes, sir. We'll get right on it.

84
00:06:49,026 --> 00:06:50,861
New England Wire and Cable.
Good morning.

85
00:06:51,028 --> 00:06:52,362
The general manager, please,

86
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:54,489
That would be Mr. Coles.

87
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,825
- Who shall I say is calling?
- Lawrence Garfield,

88
00:06:56,992 --> 00:06:59,369
Just one moment, please.

89
00:06:59,995 --> 00:07:03,289
- What did he want?
- He wants to come up and see us.

90
00:07:03,498 --> 00:07:05,166
Look the place over, he said.

91
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,544
Well, what's wrong with that?
He's a shareholder.

92
00:07:07,711 --> 00:07:09,212
Well, it's not that simple.

93
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:11,547
What this man does is no secret.

94
00:07:11,756 --> 00:07:14,258
Bill, you got the jitters.

95
00:07:14,426 --> 00:07:18,680
Wall Street's in the liquidation business
these days, Jorgy.

96
00:07:18,847 --> 00:07:21,724
My father founded this company
81 years ago.

97
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,935
- I took over 28 years ago...
- I know.

98
00:07:24,102 --> 00:07:28,898
I control this company,
and nobody's gonna liquidate us.

99
00:08:00,929 --> 00:08:03,639
What a shit pit.

100
00:08:14,234 --> 00:08:16,402
Look at this.

101
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,863
Look at this.

102
00:08:21,283 --> 00:08:24,994
I haven't seen a place this classy
since I left the Bronx.

103
00:08:57,109 --> 00:08:59,528
Welcome to New England Wire and Cable.

104
00:08:59,695 --> 00:09:02,739
I'm Bea Sullivan, Mr. Jorgenson's assistant.

105
00:09:02,907 --> 00:09:04,408
- How do you do?
- I do good.

106
00:09:04,575 --> 00:09:07,160
Would you like to invite your chauffeur in
to keep warm?

107
00:09:07,328 --> 00:09:09,788
No, no. He's a yard chauffeur, honey.

108
00:09:09,955 --> 00:09:12,832
Bring him inside, you spoil him.

109
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:15,085
Is there a Dunkin' Donuts in this town?

110
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:17,546
Dunkin' Donuts? No, I don't think so.

111
00:09:17,713 --> 00:09:20,632
- Krispy Kreme, something?
- I'm afraid not.

112
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,219
But we have coffee,
and Emma might have a breakfast roll.

113
00:09:24,386 --> 00:09:25,804
Breakfast roll?

114
00:09:26,847 --> 00:09:28,056
Do you have an elevator?

115
00:09:28,223 --> 00:09:31,851
I'm embarrassed to tell you,
it's out of order. You know elevators.

116
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:34,604
Any oxygen?

117
00:09:37,858 --> 00:09:40,694
You should have warned me.
I'd have brought a paramedic.

118
00:09:41,027 --> 00:09:44,447
Is it much further?
I'd like to get there before dark.

119
00:09:45,073 --> 00:09:47,575
Jorgy, this is Mr. Garfield.

120
00:09:47,742 --> 00:09:50,911
Mr. Garfield, Andrew Jorgenson,
our chairman.

121
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:53,873
Call me Jorgy. Everybody else does.
Sorry about the elevator.

122
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,209
- It has a mind of its own.
- Mr. Coles, president and general manager.

123
00:09:57,377 --> 00:09:59,504
- Emma, bring in the coffee!
- Nice to meet you.

124
00:09:59,671 --> 00:10:01,506
Last limousine we saw here
was in '48...

125
00:10:01,673 --> 00:10:04,300
...when Truman was running for president.
- That's right.

126
00:10:04,467 --> 00:10:07,511
He stood right out there on those stairs,
exactly where you were.

127
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,305
- Is that so?
- Yep.

128
00:10:09,472 --> 00:10:12,641
That was the golden age.
Rebuilding America and all that.

129
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:15,728
Old Harry made a great speech that day.

130
00:10:15,895 --> 00:10:19,606
- Is that so?
- Oh, yes. He was very impressive.

131
00:10:19,774 --> 00:10:22,109
He's the only Democrat
Bea and I ever voted for.

132
00:10:22,318 --> 00:10:25,487
Do you know much about
the wire and cable business, Mr. Garfield?

133
00:10:26,322 --> 00:10:29,324
I know if the cable's out of whack,
the elevator don't go up.

134
00:10:29,867 --> 00:10:32,327
- I'm thinking about the doughnuts.
- Doughnuts?

135
00:10:32,536 --> 00:10:35,372
Mr. Garfield was wondering if we had any.

136
00:10:35,581 --> 00:10:38,458
- Bill, do we have doughnuts?
- I don't think so.

137
00:10:39,251 --> 00:10:41,252
How's that coffee coming along?

138
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:46,091
- Here we are, Mr. Garfield.
- Thank you.

139
00:10:46,258 --> 00:10:48,468
- Sugar and cream?
- Sugar. I'll take care of it.

140
00:10:48,635 --> 00:10:50,970
- Thank you, Emma.
- I could have Emma get doughnuts.

141
00:10:51,138 --> 00:10:54,766
No, no. Why don't we get down
to business.

142
00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:58,519
What's the matter?
You're not interested in doughnuts?

143
00:10:58,645 --> 00:11:02,273
- Would you like me to get some doughnuts?
- No. Never mind, Emma.

144
00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:07,403
You're right.

145
00:11:07,988 --> 00:11:09,572
- Let's talk business.
- Good idea.

146
00:11:09,781 --> 00:11:11,991
What business are we talking about?

147
00:11:13,618 --> 00:11:15,745
Good coffee.

148
00:11:15,954 --> 00:11:17,789
Well, let's put it this way:

149
00:11:17,956 --> 00:11:21,125
Back in New York, I got a computer.
Her name is Carmen.

150
00:11:21,292 --> 00:11:24,670
Every morning, right after I brush my teeth,
I punch out:

151
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:29,258
"Carmen, computer on the wall,
who's the fairest of them all?"

152
00:11:29,425 --> 00:11:34,930
Now, most mornings, she spits out,
"Garfield, you're the fairest."

153
00:11:35,097 --> 00:11:38,892
But three weeks ago, she said:

154
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:43,272
"Garfield, Garfield, scratch your balls.

155
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:48,360
New England..." Pardon me. "New England
Wire and Cable is the fairest of them all."

156
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,948
New England Wire and Cable?

157
00:11:53,115 --> 00:11:57,494
I said, "What's it worth?"
So she showed me the numbers.

158
00:11:59,204 --> 00:12:03,082
You got equipment here
that costs $ 1 2O million.

159
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:06,336
Even at salvage,
it's worth 3O, 35 million.

160
00:12:06,712 --> 00:12:09,214
- Can I use that blackboard over there?
- Yeah, go ahead.

161
00:12:09,381 --> 00:12:10,924
Thank you.

162
00:12:11,091 --> 00:12:13,968
Come with me.
Carmen will educate us.

163
00:12:15,554 --> 00:12:17,973
Gonna erase this stuff here.

164
00:12:19,015 --> 00:12:20,391
Here.

165
00:12:20,725 --> 00:12:24,520
Let's put down 3O million.

166
00:12:27,524 --> 00:12:30,068
- How many acres you got?
- A hundred and ten.

167
00:12:30,277 --> 00:12:33,655
Carmen and I figure,
even as farmland, grazing land...

168
00:12:33,822 --> 00:12:35,114
...it's worth 1 O million.

169
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:36,991
- Is that fair?
- Yeah.

170
00:12:37,158 --> 00:12:41,120
Let's lay the 1 O under the 3O.
That makes 4O million.

171
00:12:41,287 --> 00:12:43,706
You bought some other companies,
didn't you, Bill?

172
00:12:43,873 --> 00:12:48,127
You have a plumbing, an electrical
and some kind of adhesive company.

173
00:12:48,294 --> 00:12:50,462
Boring, but all making a decent profit.

174
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,923
Carmen says they're worth
another 8O mil.

175
00:12:53,091 --> 00:12:54,926
Let's put the 8O under the 4O.

176
00:12:55,092 --> 00:12:59,638
And you have working capital of 25 million,
1 O of it in cash.

177
00:12:59,764 --> 00:13:03,851
Let's put down 25 million,
add them up and see what you got.

178
00:13:04,018 --> 00:13:07,896
$ 1 25 million.

179
00:13:09,148 --> 00:13:10,858
The only bad news is...

180
00:13:11,192 --> 00:13:14,403
...that this wire and cable division
isn't making a profit...

181
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,947
...and all the other divisions
have to support you.

182
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:20,450
Now, as a stockholder,
that doesn't make me very happy.

183
00:13:20,617 --> 00:13:22,243
Are you finished, Mr. Garfield?

184
00:13:22,411 --> 00:13:23,745
No, I'm not, Bill.

185
00:13:23,912 --> 00:13:26,706
Let's say Carmen was suffering
from premenstrual syndrome.

186
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:28,417
No offense. A little nuts.

187
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,543
Let's say she was too optimistic.

188
00:13:30,711 --> 00:13:33,463
Let's knock off 25 million.
Here we go.

189
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,590
Let's make it...

190
00:13:35,757 --> 00:13:37,300
...$ 1 OO million.

191
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:40,845
A nice round number.
I like nice round numbers.

192
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:43,306
Any debt? No.

193
00:13:43,515 --> 00:13:45,725
Any lawsuits?
Any environmental bullshit?

194
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:49,270
You throwing your garbage in the water?
Of course not. Not you.

195
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:51,147
What about pension liabilities?

196
00:13:51,356 --> 00:13:53,274
Carmen says you're fully funded.

197
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:55,734
You people are dreams.

198
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:58,487
- I think this meeting is over.
- No, no, wait a minute.

199
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,947
Here comes the fun part.

200
00:14:00,114 --> 00:14:02,533
- How many shares outstanding you got?
- Four million.

201
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,035
Divide 4 million into 1 OO million,
what do you get?

202
00:14:05,203 --> 00:14:06,412
- Twenty-five.
- Good.

203
00:14:06,621 --> 00:14:09,749
That means each share is worth $ 25.

204
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:13,627
But that was all foreplay.
Let's go for the real thing.

205
00:14:15,338 --> 00:14:19,842
The stock was 1 O when I woke up
three weeks ago.

206
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:22,969
That's a 1 O for a $ 25 item.

207
00:14:23,137 --> 00:14:24,555
What a sale.

208
00:14:24,722 --> 00:14:27,724
Something worth $ 25,
I can buy it for 1 O.

209
00:14:27,892 --> 00:14:30,436
The company's not for sale,
Mr. Garfield.

210
00:14:30,561 --> 00:14:32,187
I don't want your company, Jorgy.

211
00:14:32,563 --> 00:14:34,940
I just want what
every other stockholder wants:

212
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:38,193
- I wanna make money.
- You are making money, Mr. Garfield.

213
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,820
You bought the stock at 1 O.
It's now 14.

214
00:14:41,155 --> 00:14:43,824
The stock is 14 because I'm buying it.

215
00:14:43,991 --> 00:14:46,785
I'm doing my part. Now you do yours.

216
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:50,246
Get rid of this wire and cable division.
It's a financial cancer.

217
00:14:50,414 --> 00:14:54,626
Would you excuse us, please?
I want to talk to Mr. Garfield alone.

218
00:14:59,673 --> 00:15:02,759
What the hell do you think you're doing,
you little son of a bitch?

219
00:15:02,884 --> 00:15:06,846
You can't come into my town, my plant,
take my company.

220
00:15:07,013 --> 00:15:10,224
- You can't do that.
- What, you been living on Mars, Jorgy?

221
00:15:10,392 --> 00:15:11,893
It's called a corporate takeover.

222
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,645
I know what it's called,
and I'm not gonna let you do it.

223
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:17,273
It's simple. I do it all the time.

224
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,818
Well, do it someplace else.
I'm not gonna commit suicide.

225
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:24,196
Don't think of it as suicide.

226
00:15:24,322 --> 00:15:25,906
Think of it as euthanasia.

227
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:29,369
Get out.

228
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,245
Get out.

229
00:15:31,412 --> 00:15:33,330
Get out before I throw you out.

230
00:15:33,498 --> 00:15:35,750
Where are you going?
We're just doing business.

231
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:39,044
Business? With you?

232
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,171
I got a company to run.

233
00:15:42,256 --> 00:15:43,799
Yeah, well, that's my point.

234
00:15:43,924 --> 00:15:46,009
I don't like the way my company's
being run!

235
00:15:46,177 --> 00:15:48,053
And you better get your elevator fixed!

236
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,182
There's a goddamn fire raging here,
and this whole industry's up in flames!

237
00:15:52,558 --> 00:15:56,520
And you call the fire department,
and who shows up? Nobody.

238
00:15:56,687 --> 00:16:00,524
Because they're all in Japan
and Singapore and Malaysia...

239
00:16:00,691 --> 00:16:05,028
...and Taiwan and every other shithole
where they're crazy about pollution.

240
00:16:05,195 --> 00:16:08,948
And while that inferno is raging,
you're out in front...

241
00:16:09,116 --> 00:16:14,788
...mowing the lawn, tidying up,
playing with your putz on my money!

242
00:16:16,915 --> 00:16:21,461
- You'd think I was asking him for a loan.
- Good day, Mr. Garfield.

243
00:16:22,045 --> 00:16:24,964
I'm not a long-term player.

244
00:16:39,854 --> 00:16:41,730
They give us trouble today?

245
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,359
They're not gonna send us back
to the Bronx, Arthur.

246
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:46,568
Don't scare me there, Mr. G.

247
00:16:46,944 --> 00:16:49,696
Richardson, I wanna buy up
New England Wire and Cable.

248
00:16:49,864 --> 00:16:51,198
Buy everything you can.

249
00:16:51,407 --> 00:16:52,866
File a goddamned 1 3D.

250
00:16:53,034 --> 00:16:56,078
- I wanna finish this one quick.
- We're on it,

251
00:17:10,342 --> 00:17:11,926
Well, it's official.

252
00:17:12,094 --> 00:17:14,971
Our friend Garfield's intent
is to take over the company.

253
00:17:15,139 --> 00:17:18,016
He's filed his 1 3D with the SEC.

254
00:17:18,183 --> 00:17:21,769
He now owns 1 2 percent of us.

255
00:17:24,857 --> 00:17:26,733
What do you wanna do?

256
00:17:28,902 --> 00:17:30,653
I own 2O percent.

257
00:17:30,862 --> 00:17:33,072
Jorgy, we've got to protect ourselves.

258
00:17:33,198 --> 00:17:35,033
- We need legal advice.
- We have lawyers.

259
00:17:35,158 --> 00:17:36,701
They're not equipped for this.

260
00:17:36,868 --> 00:17:39,620
- We need the best.
- We want to call Kate.

261
00:17:39,788 --> 00:17:41,498
Let me.

262
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,918
What makes you think she'll come?

263
00:17:45,126 --> 00:17:47,211
I'll tell her we need her.

264
00:17:47,379 --> 00:17:49,464
We're family.

265
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,434
Flamboyant L's and M's.

266
00:18:45,811 --> 00:18:48,146
Loves to write "million," doesn't he?

267
00:18:49,147 --> 00:18:50,857
We've never seen a man like that.

268
00:18:51,024 --> 00:18:53,109
He's like something out of a comic book.

269
00:18:53,318 --> 00:18:54,569
So they say.

270
00:18:54,778 --> 00:18:57,739
- Hello, Kate.
- Jorgy.

271
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,783
Thanks for coming.

272
00:18:59,991 --> 00:19:01,409
Doesn't she look splendid?

273
00:19:01,576 --> 00:19:05,830
I have to be back in the city by 5.
Would you mind if we get right down to it?

274
00:19:06,206 --> 00:19:08,207
You're in charge, Kate.

275
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,918
Given that someone is interested
in moving in on you...

276
00:19:11,086 --> 00:19:13,129
...you've no choice
but to protect yourself.

277
00:19:13,505 --> 00:19:14,839
You have some options.

278
00:19:15,048 --> 00:19:17,967
For openers, I recommend changing
your state of incorporation...

279
00:19:18,134 --> 00:19:20,719
...from Rhode Island to Delaware.
- Why Delaware?

280
00:19:20,887 --> 00:19:24,515
That's a good idea.
Strong anti-takeover legislation in Delaware.

281
00:19:25,016 --> 00:19:27,226
And that way we're not playing dead.

282
00:19:27,393 --> 00:19:30,562
- Who the hell is playing dead?
- You have to protect yourself.

283
00:19:31,105 --> 00:19:34,274
- By running away to Delaware?
- Jorgy, it's only on paper.

284
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,946
This company was founded in Rhode Island.
It will remain in Rhode Island.

285
00:19:39,113 --> 00:19:43,158
I'm talking about Delaware, not Nairobi.
Come on.

286
00:19:43,325 --> 00:19:44,951
I own 2O percent of this company.

287
00:19:45,077 --> 00:19:48,955
The board owns another 5,
the employees another 5 percent.

288
00:19:49,123 --> 00:19:52,417
That's 3O percent.
Now, how can this man get control?

289
00:19:52,585 --> 00:19:55,671
What do you want? Do you want me
to negotiate a deal or not?

290
00:19:55,796 --> 00:19:57,923
But there's no deal to be made.

291
00:19:58,132 --> 00:19:59,550
He's knocking at your door.

292
00:19:59,675 --> 00:20:02,302
If you don't answer it,
it's the same as inviting him in.

293
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:03,720
Listen to her, Jorgy.

294
00:20:03,887 --> 00:20:07,056
There's no deal to be made
with predators.

295
00:20:07,224 --> 00:20:09,517
You kill it, or it kills you.

296
00:20:09,685 --> 00:20:11,478
Well, what do you suggest?

297
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:13,229
Make it worth his while to leave.

298
00:20:13,397 --> 00:20:14,606
How? How? What do you mean?

299
00:20:14,815 --> 00:20:17,817
Pay him off.
Buy him out at a profit.

300
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:20,277
It's greenmail, Jorgy,
but it's done all the time.

301
00:20:20,445 --> 00:20:23,781
- It's terrorism, and I won't do it!
- We have other options, don't we?

302
00:20:23,949 --> 00:20:25,700
Well, you're gonna lose your company.

303
00:20:25,867 --> 00:20:27,827
Like hell I am.

304
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:31,622
You, as they say in the street,
are in play.

305
00:20:32,082 --> 00:20:34,167
Garfield put you there.

306
00:20:34,626 --> 00:20:37,336
And now I'm here as your lawyer.

307
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:40,005
Isn't that a hell of an irony?

308
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:43,509
Me trying to save your company.

309
00:20:43,635 --> 00:20:46,179
Well, I can do it.

310
00:20:57,982 --> 00:20:59,233
Yeah?

311
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:01,943
A Miss Sullivan
from Hudson,  Bradley and Flint is here,

312
00:21:02,153 --> 00:21:04,113
And Granger wants to see you
about Trundel,

313
00:21:04,238 --> 00:21:07,032
Your suits are ready for a fitting,
Can they come up at 5?

314
00:21:07,158 --> 00:21:11,203
Yeah, 5:OO is okay. But tell them not to
send the blind son of a bitch with the pins.

315
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,039
- Right, no pins,
- And tell Granger, if he wants to see me...

316
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:17,709
...he better make more sense than last time,
or he can get on unemployment.

317
00:21:17,835 --> 00:21:19,670
Shall I use those exact words, sir?

318
00:21:19,795 --> 00:21:22,214
Send in Hudson, Bradley and Flint.

319
00:21:40,315 --> 00:21:41,983
Wow.

320
00:21:43,985 --> 00:21:47,571
You know what kills me? I've done
maybe seven, eight deals like this before...

321
00:21:47,781 --> 00:21:49,491
...and you know who I negotiate with?

322
00:21:49,657 --> 00:21:53,410
Skinny little joggers with contact lenses,
all stinking from the same aftershave.

323
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,912
- I'm Kate Sullivan.
- I know.

324
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:57,039
- Want a cigarette?
- No, thank you.

325
00:21:58,082 --> 00:21:59,625
Don't let me stop you.

326
00:22:01,294 --> 00:22:03,421
Why would you stop me?

327
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:05,506
What are you, a fucking lawyer?

328
00:22:05,673 --> 00:22:07,257
Depends on who I'm with.

329
00:22:08,342 --> 00:22:10,302
Welcome to my life.

330
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,096
So, what's it gonna be?

331
00:22:12,263 --> 00:22:14,890
Sue, settle, defend?

332
00:22:15,057 --> 00:22:16,558
I came to talk.

333
00:22:17,852 --> 00:22:19,562
Oh, that's trouble.

334
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:22,898
Lawyers wanna talk,
nothing but trouble.

335
00:22:23,065 --> 00:22:25,609
- How about a doughnut?
- No, thanks.

336
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,738
- Why, are you a health-food freak?
- No, just not hungry.

337
00:22:29,905 --> 00:22:32,407
- You have to be hungry to eat a doughnut?
- You don't?

338
00:22:32,783 --> 00:22:33,992
What, are you shitting me?

339
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,703
I never heard of such a thing,
have to be hungry.

340
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,871
Why? It don't taste better that way.

341
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,416
- How would you know?
- What do you want?

342
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,294
- I need a month.
- Get lost.

343
00:22:44,461 --> 00:22:48,214
I just got involved. I need time to get
everybody's act together.

344
00:22:48,382 --> 00:22:49,674
My act is together.

345
00:22:51,259 --> 00:22:54,845
If you give me some time,
I think we can work something out.

346
00:22:55,889 --> 00:22:57,390
Settle?

347
00:22:57,557 --> 00:22:58,808
Work something out.

348
00:22:59,392 --> 00:23:02,603
- I only settle when I'm in trouble.
- Or when it makes sense.

349
00:23:03,396 --> 00:23:05,231
It only makes sense when I'm in trouble.

350
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:08,359
Well, if you prefer, we'll go to court.

351
00:23:08,526 --> 00:23:12,446
Get an injunction, have a fight.
All kinds of allegations.

352
00:23:12,614 --> 00:23:14,782
Costs them, costs you, and for what?

353
00:23:15,366 --> 00:23:17,534
I live in court.
You gotta do better than that.

354
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:25,751
I won't love you anymore.

355
00:23:28,212 --> 00:23:30,672
- Two weeks.
- Standstill agreement.

356
00:23:31,507 --> 00:23:33,342
- Both sides.
- No more buying.

357
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:35,844
- Two weeks.
- Thank you.

358
00:23:36,053 --> 00:23:37,262
Whoa, where are you going?

359
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:40,140
We haven't talked about
what I wanna talk about.

360
00:23:40,307 --> 00:23:45,103
- What's that?
- You and me sweating between satin sheets.

361
00:23:46,689 --> 00:23:50,734
Garfield, put your hand between your legs.

362
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:52,944
Do it!

363
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:57,950
Good. Now look directly down
at that little guy...

364
00:23:58,117 --> 00:24:02,621
...and you say, "You must behave yourself
when you're in the presence of a lady."

365
00:24:02,788 --> 00:24:07,000
Garfield, if you don't say exactly that
right now, I'm resigning from this case.

366
00:24:11,129 --> 00:24:14,340
- You must behave yourself...
- You must behave yourself...

367
00:24:14,508 --> 00:24:17,677
...when you're in the presence...
...when you're in the presence...

368
00:24:17,886 --> 00:24:19,846
...of a lady.

369
00:24:23,975 --> 00:24:27,103
See? Not so hard.

370
00:24:38,198 --> 00:24:40,283
See you in two weeks.

371
00:24:41,326 --> 00:24:43,369
Wow! Did you see that, Carmen?

372
00:24:44,746 --> 00:24:46,372
I'm in love, I'm in love.

373
00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:48,749
- Goodbye, Miss Sullivan.
- Goodbye.

374
00:25:04,723 --> 00:25:08,017
Call Erickson. Tell him to arrange
some money through the Royal Bank.

375
00:25:08,227 --> 00:25:10,437
Don't pay more than we did
on Fleetwood Furniture.

376
00:25:10,604 --> 00:25:11,980
Then call Hathaway.

377
00:25:12,147 --> 00:25:15,316
Tell him I want to make a tender offer
for New England Wire and Cable.

378
00:25:15,484 --> 00:25:16,818
Don't put it under our name.

379
00:25:16,985 --> 00:25:19,153
Label it OPM Holdings.

380
00:25:19,321 --> 00:25:21,656
But what if she finds out
we broke the agreement?

381
00:25:23,575 --> 00:25:25,702
Richardson, what were you,
born yesterday?

382
00:25:25,827 --> 00:25:27,662
What do you think she's doing?

383
00:25:27,788 --> 00:25:30,707
That kewpie doll's up to no good.
Do it.

384
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:34,753
I got us an extra two weeks.
Now we have to move fast.

385
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,547
Get the board to buy up as many shares
as they can.

386
00:25:37,672 --> 00:25:39,507
Use your own working capital.

387
00:25:39,633 --> 00:25:41,551
No,  that's not what
those dollars are for,

388
00:25:41,718 --> 00:25:44,387
- That's our safety net,
- Then borrow the money.

389
00:25:44,512 --> 00:25:48,140
- No borrowing.
- Andrew, listen to her. She's making sense.

390
00:25:48,266 --> 00:25:52,186
For every share you acquire,
it's one less for Garfield,

391
00:25:52,312 --> 00:25:54,856
The more we buy, the less for him.

392
00:25:55,064 --> 00:25:57,900
The more it costs, the less profit he makes.

393
00:25:58,067 --> 00:25:59,485
So get the stock up.

394
00:25:59,652 --> 00:26:02,446
And, Mom, make sure to buy it
through an out-of-state broker.

395
00:26:02,613 --> 00:26:06,992
I don't wanna borrow money.
We've been debt-free since the depression.

396
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,120
But see, that's the trouble, Jorgy.

397
00:26:09,287 --> 00:26:12,873
It's your gorgeous balance sheet
that makes you so attractive.

398
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,375
And, Mom, get letters out
to the shareholders.

399
00:26:15,543 --> 00:26:19,171
Tell them how great business is
and how wonderful the future looks,

400
00:26:19,338 --> 00:26:20,964
- I'll do it.
- Great,

401
00:26:21,132 --> 00:26:24,635
I'll call you tomorrow.
Good night.

402
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:51,202
Good morning, honey.

403
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,504
How you doing this morning, huh?

404
00:27:09,304 --> 00:27:11,180
You got it up again.

405
00:27:12,182 --> 00:27:14,058
Another point and a half.

406
00:27:14,726 --> 00:27:16,477
- Pfeiffer.
- Good morning, Mr. Garfield.

407
00:27:16,644 --> 00:27:18,354
- Woody.
- Good morning, Mr. Garfield.

408
00:27:18,563 --> 00:27:19,772
- Harriet.
- Good morning.

409
00:27:19,981 --> 00:27:22,024
Miss Sullivan is gonna call
tomorrow morning.

410
00:27:22,191 --> 00:27:24,318
You tell her I'm not taking calls.

411
00:27:24,485 --> 00:27:27,613
Then, when she comes over here
and tries to storm into the office...

412
00:27:27,822 --> 00:27:30,324
...you try to keep her out.
But then let her push past.

413
00:27:30,491 --> 00:27:35,495
Don't worry, she's desperate but harmless.
Find out where she lives and call a florist.

414
00:27:36,163 --> 00:27:37,497
- Florist?
- Florist.

415
00:27:42,002 --> 00:27:44,921
You have a good evening, Miss Sullivan.

416
00:27:46,882 --> 00:27:50,385
- Hello, Michael.
- Oh, Miss Sullivan, here.

417
00:27:50,552 --> 00:27:53,554
- Somebody brought these by for you.
- Oh, thank you.

418
00:27:53,722 --> 00:27:55,682
- Good night.
- Good night.

419
00:28:46,899 --> 00:28:48,692
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

420
00:28:53,489 --> 00:28:57,451
- You ruthless son of a bitch!
- Excuse me?

421
00:28:57,618 --> 00:28:59,369
Jeez, I wonder what her problem is.

422
00:29:18,889 --> 00:29:20,890
All right, all right.

423
00:29:26,813 --> 00:29:28,022
Excuse me.

424
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:31,860
- Hello, Miss Sullivan, may I help you?
- No, I'm sorry. I don't care. I will...

425
00:29:32,903 --> 00:29:36,323
- I don't care! I'm not gonna...
- It's all right, Harriet.

426
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:39,534
- You can't go in.
- It's not all right, you hypocrite! You lied!

427
00:29:40,368 --> 00:29:42,620
- But, baby-poo...
- We had an agreement.

428
00:29:42,746 --> 00:29:45,540
We had a standstill!
No more buying!

429
00:29:45,665 --> 00:29:49,085
- OPM Holdings? You know nothing about it?
- OPM?

430
00:29:49,252 --> 00:29:51,962
- Not a lot to know.
- You broke the agreement!

431
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:55,466
You embarrassed me with my firm.
You embarrassed me with my clients!

432
00:29:55,633 --> 00:29:57,301
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

433
00:29:57,427 --> 00:29:59,720
Don't come on so holier-than-thou with me.

434
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:03,182
What am I supposed to do,
sit here while you drive up the stock?

435
00:30:03,349 --> 00:30:06,143
- I did no such thing.
- You're full of shit.

436
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:10,188
All that buying coming from some little
cockamamie brokerage firm in Rhode Island?

437
00:30:10,356 --> 00:30:12,399
You'd think you'd use an out-of-state firm.

438
00:30:12,608 --> 00:30:14,234
I know nothing about that.

439
00:30:14,443 --> 00:30:15,694
Give me a break.

440
00:30:15,861 --> 00:30:18,113
Who am I dealing with here,
Mother Teresa?

441
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,657
You want to play the game,
learn to play it right.

442
00:30:20,783 --> 00:30:23,493
Oh, is that what you call it,
a game?

443
00:30:23,661 --> 00:30:26,330
You're damn right.
The best game in the world.

444
00:30:26,497 --> 00:30:28,498
I'll teach you. It's easy.

445
00:30:28,624 --> 00:30:31,334
You make as much as you can
for as long as you can.

446
00:30:31,502 --> 00:30:32,711
And then what?

447
00:30:33,212 --> 00:30:34,504
"And then what?"

448
00:30:34,672 --> 00:30:36,965
Whoever has the most when he dies,
wins.

449
00:30:37,174 --> 00:30:39,968
Look. It's the American way.

450
00:30:40,177 --> 00:30:42,470
I'm doing my job.

451
00:30:42,638 --> 00:30:44,181
I'm a capitalist.

452
00:30:44,306 --> 00:30:47,142
I'm simply following
the law of free enterprise.

453
00:30:47,309 --> 00:30:48,852
What law is that?

454
00:30:49,227 --> 00:30:50,645
Survival of the fittest.

455
00:30:51,688 --> 00:30:53,564
Maybe some people don't see it that way.

456
00:30:53,732 --> 00:30:56,067
Maybe they don't see it
as survival of the fittest.

457
00:30:56,234 --> 00:31:00,488
- Maybe they see it as survival of the fattest!
- Oh, Katie, why are you so hard on me?

458
00:31:00,655 --> 00:31:02,198
Because you're not nice.

459
00:31:02,365 --> 00:31:04,492
Since when do you have to be nice
to be right?

460
00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:06,911
You're not right.
You're what's happening.

461
00:31:07,245 --> 00:31:10,748
One day we'll smarten up and pass some
laws and put you out of business.

462
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,460
They can pass all the laws they want.

463
00:31:14,586 --> 00:31:16,796
All they can do is change the rules.

464
00:31:16,963 --> 00:31:19,340
They can never stop the game.

465
00:31:19,465 --> 00:31:22,301
I don't go away. I adapt.

466
00:31:22,468 --> 00:31:25,512
Ten years from now, they'll be studying
you at the Wharton School.

467
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,431
They'll call it the Garfield Era...

468
00:31:27,598 --> 00:31:30,183
...and rinse their mouths out
when they leave the room!

469
00:31:30,351 --> 00:31:32,311
- I'll see you in court!
- Oh, Katie.

470
00:31:32,478 --> 00:31:35,105
Don't leave.
We haven't talked about sex yet.

471
00:31:35,314 --> 00:31:37,315
- At least have a doughnut.
- Stuff it!

472
00:31:37,525 --> 00:31:39,276
Come on. Don't be a poor loser!

473
00:31:39,693 --> 00:31:43,947
Lying to protect your client
is just doing a good job. I understand that.

474
00:31:44,156 --> 00:31:46,658
You didn't even ask me
what OPM stands for.

475
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:50,161
Other people's money!

476
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:56,085
All right, come on, come on!
Let's go!

477
00:31:56,251 --> 00:31:58,544
- Work, work, work!
- Yes, sir!

478
00:32:25,739 --> 00:32:29,242
Gotcha! Oh, yes.

479
00:32:31,244 --> 00:32:32,536
How do you have them?

480
00:32:33,496 --> 00:32:36,874
Two years ago, he tried to take over
Westridge Corporation.

481
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:40,627
He was put under indictment for failing
to disclose his 1 3D.

482
00:32:40,795 --> 00:32:42,129
- What's this?
- Christmas list.

483
00:32:42,338 --> 00:32:44,715
- What did they do?
- Nothing. Dropped the charges.

484
00:32:44,882 --> 00:32:46,508
- Investors get hurt?
- Nope.

485
00:32:46,676 --> 00:32:49,095
If the charges were dropped,
it's a technicality.

486
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,513
He was required to disclose.

487
00:32:51,681 --> 00:32:52,973
Gerber's in prison, Richard.

488
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:57,519
Judge Pollard ain't gonna give you
a restraining order based on a technicality.

489
00:32:59,647 --> 00:33:02,316
We are a nation of laws, Marcia.

490
00:33:02,483 --> 00:33:04,860
Ultimately, those laws come down
to technicalities.

491
00:33:05,486 --> 00:33:08,363
Without those technicalities,
what do we have?

492
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,864
Anarchy.

493
00:33:10,074 --> 00:33:11,909
Garfield.

494
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:16,913
- Anarchy? That's the basis for your brief?
- Correct.

495
00:33:17,081 --> 00:33:19,791
Honeybunch, you better write
a fantastic brief.

496
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:22,543
- I intend to.
- You wanna send anything to Garfield?

497
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:25,213
Yeah. A court order.

498
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:30,802
Do the Japanese celebrate Christmas?

499
00:33:30,969 --> 00:33:33,471
No, but I hear they're buying it.

500
00:33:39,227 --> 00:33:41,228
I had nothing to do with any of this.

501
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:43,481
Pfeiffer comes walking in...

502
00:33:49,446 --> 00:33:51,823
TRO.

503
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:55,868
Temporary restraining order.

504
00:33:56,035 --> 00:33:58,704
Thank you very much.

505
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:07,296
Some crew I've got.

506
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:11,132
Seventeen lawyers...

507
00:34:11,259 --> 00:34:12,843
...on retainer.

508
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:15,637
And you manage to work it out...

509
00:34:15,805 --> 00:34:18,557
...so that in a free market...

510
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:21,601
...a so-called free country...

511
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:28,191
...I can't buy some shit-ass stock
every other asshole can buy.

512
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:30,777
Congratulations.

513
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:33,863
You're destroying the capitalist system.

514
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:36,741
While everybody else
in the world is embracing it...

515
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:40,412
...my boys and girls are fucking it up!

516
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:44,416
You know what happens
when capitalism gets fucked up?

517
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:46,251
The communists come back.

518
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:49,003
They come out of the bushes.
Don't kid yourself.

519
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:51,298
They're waiting in there.

520
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,509
But maybe that's not so bad.

521
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:58,513
Because you know what happens
when the commies take over?

522
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:02,851
The first thing they do
is shoot all the lawyers!

523
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:06,229
And if they miss any of you,
I'll do it myself!

524
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:09,190
Now let's see if we can get
this small-town judge...

525
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:12,026
...to change his fucking mind!

526
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,278
Come on.

527
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:20,450
It wasn't me!
I was in San Francisco!

528
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:28,793
Mr, Garfield,
a Miss Sullivan is on the line,

529
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,879
- Yes.
- Hello, Lawrence.

530
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:35,883
We're here in the office,
toasting Judge Pollard's decision,

531
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,343
Stop gloating. It doesn't become you.

532
00:35:38,552 --> 00:35:40,220
Don't be a poor loser,

533
00:35:40,387 --> 00:35:45,266
I got you on a technicality. Not bad
for some broad wet behind the ears.

534
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,102
I'd like to talk,

535
00:35:47,269 --> 00:35:50,188
I have no time for talk. My days are full.

536
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:53,066
- I'll buy you a doughnut.
- I'm not hungry.

537
00:35:53,233 --> 00:35:56,110
Since when do you have to be hungry
to have a doughnut?

538
00:35:56,278 --> 00:35:57,988
Shut up,

539
00:35:58,155 --> 00:36:00,490
Stop pouting. I'll buy you dinner.

540
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:04,453
Name the place.
I have a proposition for you.

541
00:36:04,578 --> 00:36:06,913
You're trying to seduce me.

542
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:10,959
You have a nice laugh.

543
00:36:11,126 --> 00:36:12,669
My house, 8: OO.

544
00:36:12,836 --> 00:36:14,921
How about Lutece?

545
00:36:15,088 --> 00:36:17,173
I wanna talk to somebody,
I go to them.

546
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,426
You wanna talk, come to me, 8: OO.

547
00:36:20,594 --> 00:36:24,764
I'll come for 2O minutes.
That's all I need. Strictly business.

548
00:36:24,931 --> 00:36:27,475
Twenty minutes, my place,  8:OO,

549
00:36:28,017 --> 00:36:30,144
- 5:3O
- 5:3O?

550
00:36:30,311 --> 00:36:32,813
- Funerals are at 5:3O. Seven.
- Six,

551
00:36:32,939 --> 00:36:36,108
- I gotta wash my face.
- 8:3O.

552
00:36:36,693 --> 00:36:38,403
- Deal.
- Deal.

553
00:36:38,569 --> 00:36:40,654
Harriet!

554
00:36:41,864 --> 00:36:44,157
Get me my barber.
Get me my manicurist.

555
00:36:44,325 --> 00:36:47,244
Call Arthur. She's coming to the house.

556
00:37:09,558 --> 00:37:11,851
- Miss Sullivan.
- That's me.

557
00:37:11,977 --> 00:37:15,313
- Come on in. The boss is expecting you.
- Thank you.

558
00:37:37,586 --> 00:37:40,255
- Mr. G will be right with you.
- Thank you.

559
00:38:36,643 --> 00:38:39,020
Gloria Taylor.

560
00:38:39,188 --> 00:38:40,814
Quarterback's girlfriend.

561
00:38:41,607 --> 00:38:45,652
All that putz wanted to do was
take her pants off in the back seat...

562
00:38:45,861 --> 00:38:48,905
...while I was ready to feed her...

563
00:38:49,072 --> 00:38:53,451
...protect her,
put jewels around her neck.

564
00:38:53,618 --> 00:38:56,537
I sent her poetry.

565
00:38:56,746 --> 00:38:58,747
Longfellow.

566
00:38:58,957 --> 00:39:01,292
Can't go wrong with Longfellow.

567
00:39:03,795 --> 00:39:08,382
Day by day I gazed upon her

568
00:39:09,717 --> 00:39:15,722
Day by day I sighed with passion

569
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:19,268
Day by day my heart within me

570
00:39:19,435 --> 00:39:22,729
Grew more hot with love and longing

571
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,818
I gave her "Hiawatha."

572
00:39:27,985 --> 00:39:31,154
All she wanted was a touchdown.

573
00:39:32,365 --> 00:39:34,325
Yeah.

574
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:37,577
To the quarterback's girlfriend.

575
00:39:37,745 --> 00:39:39,997
To Gloria.

576
00:39:47,296 --> 00:39:49,798
Drink, drink. It's the best.

577
00:39:53,635 --> 00:39:56,596
- You look terrific.
- Thank you.

578
00:39:58,473 --> 00:40:00,683
How about some mushroom dip?

579
00:40:03,312 --> 00:40:05,313
I thought this was a business meeting.

580
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,982
What's wrong with a little dip?

581
00:40:08,191 --> 00:40:11,110
I never met a person so hard to feed.

582
00:40:11,278 --> 00:40:12,862
Who are you mad at?

583
00:40:13,029 --> 00:40:16,073
Come on, have some dip.

584
00:40:38,554 --> 00:40:40,555
Swallow.

585
00:40:43,768 --> 00:40:45,019
Nice.

586
00:40:45,561 --> 00:40:47,604
I think we should talk business.

587
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:49,398
You have an exquisite neck.

588
00:40:49,565 --> 00:40:52,567
I have to leave by 7.
I have another engagement.

589
00:40:53,611 --> 00:40:56,238
Oh, right. I forgot.

590
00:40:56,405 --> 00:40:59,282
- You got a "proposition."
- Thank you.

591
00:41:06,165 --> 00:41:10,335
- Shoot.
- What will it take for you to go away?

592
00:41:10,544 --> 00:41:12,379
Greenmail?

593
00:41:12,546 --> 00:41:14,256
You're offering to buy me out?

594
00:41:14,423 --> 00:41:17,217
Why so uptight? It's not illegal.

595
00:41:17,926 --> 00:41:19,719
It's immoral.

596
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:23,973
A distinction that has
no relevance for lawyers.

597
00:41:24,141 --> 00:41:26,434
But it matters to me.

598
00:41:26,601 --> 00:41:29,520
Well, for someone who has
nothing nice to say about lawyers...

599
00:41:29,688 --> 00:41:32,649
...you certainly have
plenty of them around.

600
00:41:33,733 --> 00:41:35,985
They're like nuclear warheads.

601
00:41:36,152 --> 00:41:38,487
They have theirs, so I have mine.

602
00:41:38,655 --> 00:41:41,199
Once you use them,
they fuck up everything.

603
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:42,784
Let me ask you:

604
00:41:42,951 --> 00:41:45,620
Do you have authorization
to offer me greenmail?

605
00:41:48,164 --> 00:41:50,165
Of course not.

606
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:52,793
It's a lawyer's scheme.

607
00:41:52,961 --> 00:41:54,837
Everybody walks out happy.

608
00:41:55,004 --> 00:41:56,588
I get paid off.

609
00:41:56,756 --> 00:41:58,966
Jorgy keeps his company.

610
00:41:59,092 --> 00:42:01,511
The employees keep their jobs.

611
00:42:01,677 --> 00:42:04,304
The lawyer gets a big fat fee.

612
00:42:04,472 --> 00:42:07,516
Everybody walks out. Yumpin' yiminy.

613
00:42:07,683 --> 00:42:09,643
Sounds pretty good to me.

614
00:42:09,769 --> 00:42:12,646
- Except for the stockholders.
- Their stock falls out of bed...

615
00:42:12,772 --> 00:42:16,275
...they don't know what hit them.
- Now you're Albert Schweitzer.

616
00:42:16,442 --> 00:42:19,695
No, not Albert Schweitzer,
Robin Hood.

617
00:42:19,862 --> 00:42:22,781
I take from the rich,
and I give to the middle class.

618
00:42:22,948 --> 00:42:24,366
Well, the upper middle class.

619
00:42:24,533 --> 00:42:26,952
- Would you care for some caviar?
- The stock is 18.

620
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,495
Do you like music? The violin?

621
00:42:28,662 --> 00:42:31,664
- Let's be serious.
- Come on, let's change the subject.

622
00:42:31,832 --> 00:42:36,211
- Arthur.
- The stock is 18. We'll buy it back at 18.

623
00:42:36,378 --> 00:42:39,255
- First you laugh at me, then you insult me.
- Then name your number.

624
00:42:39,464 --> 00:42:41,340
- What will you take?
- Twenty-five.

625
00:42:41,508 --> 00:42:43,509
The stock hasn't seen 25 in years.

626
00:42:43,677 --> 00:42:45,887
You want history?
The stock was once 8O.

627
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:47,514
Take 2O.

628
00:42:47,723 --> 00:42:49,015
Such a high achiever.

629
00:42:49,182 --> 00:42:51,559
If you're mad at somebody,
don't take it out on me.

630
00:42:51,685 --> 00:42:53,728
Twenty-five is my number,
and that's a favor.

631
00:42:53,895 --> 00:42:57,106
Well, I don't like your number,
and I don't need to be analyzed.

632
00:42:57,274 --> 00:42:58,650
Do we have a deal or not?

633
00:42:58,817 --> 00:43:00,193
Let's discuss it over dinner.

634
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,905
- Good night. Your 2O minutes are up.
- Wait a minute. I want us to be friends.

635
00:43:04,072 --> 00:43:07,200
Let's segue into some soup
and french bread.

636
00:43:08,243 --> 00:43:10,578
Come on. Don't go away mad.

637
00:43:10,745 --> 00:43:13,414
I didn't buy your proposition.
Come back with another one.

638
00:43:13,581 --> 00:43:16,875
You're an emancipated woman.
Learn to lose.

639
00:43:17,043 --> 00:43:19,420
- I haven't lost.
- Wait, wait!

640
00:43:19,587 --> 00:43:22,965
I got a proposition for you.
Hold on, you gotta listen.

641
00:43:23,758 --> 00:43:25,134
You come on back up.

642
00:43:25,301 --> 00:43:27,219
We have a nice dinner.

643
00:43:28,304 --> 00:43:31,390
We make passionate love
for the rest of the night.

644
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:34,809
The first one who comes, loses.

645
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,021
- Loses what?
- The deal.

646
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:41,858
I come first, I sell you back
my shares at cost.

647
00:43:42,026 --> 00:43:45,362
You come first, you buy them at 25.

648
00:43:47,489 --> 00:43:49,490
I think you're serious.

649
00:43:50,492 --> 00:43:53,119
So how do you suggest
we write this up?

650
00:43:54,163 --> 00:43:55,497
Delicately.

651
00:43:55,664 --> 00:43:59,459
Under the heading,
"Easy come, easy go."

652
00:43:59,626 --> 00:44:03,796
What do you got to lose, your virginity?
I could lose millions.

653
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:08,384
So, what happens if we come together?

654
00:44:11,805 --> 00:44:13,598
I never thought of that.

655
00:44:15,892 --> 00:44:17,643
Well...

656
00:44:17,769 --> 00:44:19,854
...think about it, honey.

657
00:44:20,063 --> 00:44:22,565
I will. I will.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

658
00:44:22,732 --> 00:44:24,900
Come on. Don't go.

659
00:44:25,068 --> 00:44:27,862
I haven't played my violin yet.

660
00:46:30,649 --> 00:46:33,234
Oh, God.

661
00:46:35,696 --> 00:46:37,697
Hello?

662
00:46:38,782 --> 00:46:40,825
I just wanted to see if you got home safe.

663
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,287
Thank you.

664
00:46:45,372 --> 00:46:47,832
In your beddy-bye?

665
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:50,585
I am.

666
00:46:51,628 --> 00:46:53,588
- Did I wake you?
- No.

667
00:46:53,755 --> 00:46:55,173
No.

668
00:46:56,883 --> 00:47:00,177
- Did you have dinner?
- Yes.

669
00:47:00,345 --> 00:47:02,388
With who?

670
00:47:02,555 --> 00:47:04,932
None of your business.

671
00:47:08,311 --> 00:47:10,479
- Are you thinking about me?
- No.

672
00:47:10,605 --> 00:47:14,025
Well, how could
you possibly manage that?

673
00:47:14,192 --> 00:47:17,570
Pills, whiskey, self-help tapes.

674
00:47:22,116 --> 00:47:24,201
I got another proposition for you.

675
00:47:24,368 --> 00:47:26,578
Oh,  yeah? I can't wait,

676
00:47:26,746 --> 00:47:28,372
We swap.

677
00:47:30,124 --> 00:47:33,001
Swap what, dirty jokes?

678
00:47:35,045 --> 00:47:36,755
No. I give you all my shares...

679
00:47:36,881 --> 00:47:39,300
...you give me the wire and cable division.

680
00:47:41,719 --> 00:47:43,262
Hello?

681
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:45,597
Hello? You like?

682
00:47:45,723 --> 00:47:48,892
- I'll ask them.
- Good.

683
00:47:49,059 --> 00:47:52,479
All right, now wait. Don't go away.
Don't hang up. Don't hang up.

684
00:47:52,604 --> 00:47:55,148
Stay right where you are. All right.

685
00:47:57,025 --> 00:47:58,526
Okay.

686
00:48:38,983 --> 00:48:40,859
Here comes the bridge.

687
00:49:27,948 --> 00:49:29,532
That was very good.

688
00:49:29,741 --> 00:49:31,742
- Thank you.
- You're welcome,

689
00:49:31,952 --> 00:49:33,328
That was just for you.

690
00:49:33,536 --> 00:49:35,204
Well, I appreciate it.

691
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:36,873
Sweet dreams,

692
00:49:36,998 --> 00:49:40,543
- Okay. Good night.
- Bye-bye.

693
00:49:42,087 --> 00:49:44,297
Oh, God.

694
00:50:11,866 --> 00:50:13,325
Forget it.

695
00:50:13,492 --> 00:50:15,744
Tell him to go to hell.

696
00:50:15,911 --> 00:50:18,997
He spends $ 1 3 million for this place...

697
00:50:19,206 --> 00:50:21,291
...then he sells it for 35.

698
00:50:21,458 --> 00:50:25,211
My guys are out of work,
and he's made $ 22 million.

699
00:50:25,379 --> 00:50:28,632
- Now how do I live with that?
- We eliminate a losing division.

700
00:50:28,757 --> 00:50:31,176
The other divisions don't have
to support us anymore.

701
00:50:31,343 --> 00:50:33,762
- I don't wanna hear that.
- You still control the company.

702
00:50:33,929 --> 00:50:37,057
- You just don't have the cable division.
- Why is it so difficult...

703
00:50:37,224 --> 00:50:38,725
...for everybody to understand...

704
00:50:38,934 --> 00:50:41,978
...why I can't kill these people
and this town...

705
00:50:42,187 --> 00:50:45,773
...to enrich some son of a bitch
who's trying to destroy me?

706
00:50:45,982 --> 00:50:48,401
I can't play with him
in the courts forever.

707
00:50:48,568 --> 00:50:51,612
He'll get the injunction lifted
and buy more shares.

708
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:54,657
Don't be a pigheaded fool.

709
00:50:54,824 --> 00:50:57,201
He deserves to lose this company.

710
00:51:08,504 --> 00:51:11,465
- Good night, Mr. Jorgenson.
- Good night, Gus.

711
00:51:11,633 --> 00:51:13,718
Everything going along okay,
Mr. Jorgenson?

712
00:51:13,926 --> 00:51:15,636
Everything's moving right along, Gus.

713
00:51:15,803 --> 00:51:18,513
Everything's gonna be okay,
isn't it, at the plant?

714
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:21,933
- I mean, at the plant and everything?
- Everything's gonna be just fine.

715
00:51:22,101 --> 00:51:24,811
We'll be making wire and cable
for a long time.

716
00:51:24,979 --> 00:51:27,981
- Yes, sir. Good night, sir.
- Good night.

717
00:51:31,193 --> 00:51:32,861
Jorgy?

718
00:51:34,029 --> 00:51:36,781
- Have you got a minute?
- Sure, Bill.

719
00:51:38,617 --> 00:51:41,536
Do you mind if I speak frankly
to you, Jorgy?

720
00:51:42,579 --> 00:51:44,455
You always have, haven't you?

721
00:51:45,749 --> 00:51:47,000
You know...

722
00:51:47,167 --> 00:51:50,420
...I'm trained to think in contingency.

723
00:51:50,587 --> 00:51:53,172
You know I've spent my life
managing businesses, and...

724
00:51:53,799 --> 00:51:55,258
And...

725
00:51:55,425 --> 00:51:58,010
Bill, you're in a panic.

726
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:01,056
Well, you know how it is
with business, Jorgy.

727
00:52:01,223 --> 00:52:03,850
When things don't work out quite right...

728
00:52:04,059 --> 00:52:08,479
...and people have invested a lot of time,
a lot of their energy, a lot of themselves...

729
00:52:08,647 --> 00:52:11,775
...management takes care of its own, Jorgy.
It happens all the time.

730
00:52:11,942 --> 00:52:16,946
And given the uncertainty
surrounding us these days...

731
00:52:18,114 --> 00:52:22,618
...and the fact that you haven't set up
any financial guarantees for us, Jorgy...

732
00:52:25,205 --> 00:52:28,916
Lord, I hate...
Hate giving this speech.

733
00:52:29,083 --> 00:52:33,545
When I retire in two years, I've told you,
you're taking over the business.

734
00:52:33,713 --> 00:52:35,131
I promised you that.

735
00:52:35,298 --> 00:52:38,634
There won't be any business
in two years, Jorgy.

736
00:52:38,843 --> 00:52:41,470
There won't be any business in one year.

737
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:44,390
You're holding on to a dream.

738
00:52:45,308 --> 00:52:47,476
Go home, Bill. Have a drink.

739
00:52:47,685 --> 00:52:50,229
Give my best to Jeanette.

740
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:54,358
I don't want the rug pulled out
from under me so close to the finish line.

741
00:52:55,568 --> 00:52:57,569
Good night.

742
00:52:58,362 --> 00:53:01,615
Jorgy, I've been here 1 5 years.
I have a family. Something's due me.

743
00:53:01,782 --> 00:53:04,034
Now, I've worked my ass off
for 1 5 years...

744
00:53:04,201 --> 00:53:08,204
...and you're gonna let that man come in
and take over the company. It's not right.

745
00:53:10,207 --> 00:53:11,833
I'm sorry, Bill.

746
00:53:12,042 --> 00:53:16,129
Up here we don't plan the funeral
until the body is dead.

747
00:53:27,516 --> 00:53:29,726
Sounds like everybody's hungry.

748
00:53:29,893 --> 00:53:31,978
Well, let's eat.

749
00:53:32,187 --> 00:53:34,439
- Sit down, darling.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

750
00:53:38,818 --> 00:53:41,612
Thank thee, Father, for thy care,
for thy bounty everywhere.

751
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:45,575
For this and every other gift,
our grateful hearts to thee we lift.

752
00:53:45,742 --> 00:53:47,243
Amen.

753
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:59,421
Second down and 1 O, Lions at their 49,

754
00:53:59,589 --> 00:54:02,466
I don't know why you watch this.
It's so stupid!

755
00:54:02,592 --> 00:54:05,344
Maybe if you'd watch, you'd see.
See, he's going right now.

756
00:54:05,511 --> 00:54:07,846
Yes. Go, go, go!

757
00:54:08,014 --> 00:54:11,475
I told you.
My money was on Detroit.

758
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,329
Have to admit,
we still have fresh air up here.

759
00:54:34,122 --> 00:54:35,957
Feels good, all right.

760
00:54:38,585 --> 00:54:41,671
I'm awfully glad you came, Kate.

761
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:44,507
It means a hell of a lot to your mother.

762
00:54:45,467 --> 00:54:46,968
I love your mother.

763
00:54:47,427 --> 00:54:51,430
I can't say I'm sorry for that,
but I am sorry for whatever it is...

764
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:55,894
...that it's done to you
in the last 21 - Odd years.

765
00:54:56,061 --> 00:54:58,480
I'm okay, Jorgy.

766
00:54:58,688 --> 00:55:00,189
Good.

767
00:55:00,315 --> 00:55:02,734
Now let's talk a little business.

768
00:55:02,901 --> 00:55:05,862
Let's quit talking about what I won't do.

769
00:55:06,446 --> 00:55:08,906
Let's talk about what I will do.

770
00:55:10,241 --> 00:55:11,867
I have a problem.

771
00:55:12,952 --> 00:55:15,037
I'm a good lawyer.
I'm a lousy mind reader.

772
00:55:15,204 --> 00:55:19,207
I wanna put it to a vote.
Annual meeting in four weeks.

773
00:55:19,375 --> 00:55:21,794
Wanna put it in the hands
of the stockholders.

774
00:55:21,961 --> 00:55:24,546
Can't do that. It's too risky.
We could lose everything.

775
00:55:24,672 --> 00:55:28,008
- You're a fighter. I'm a fighter.
- It's too dangerous.

776
00:55:28,634 --> 00:55:32,054
There's no other choice
that I can live with.

777
00:55:33,889 --> 00:55:36,975
This 3O percent,
this faithful 3O percent...

778
00:55:37,142 --> 00:55:38,852
...can you absolutely count on them?

779
00:55:39,019 --> 00:55:41,229
They haven't let me down so far.

780
00:55:41,397 --> 00:55:43,982
Awful lot of Ozzies on our side.

781
00:55:44,983 --> 00:55:46,901
Don't trust Ozzie. He's a banker.

782
00:55:47,361 --> 00:55:50,071
I have to trust my friends, Kate.

783
00:55:56,203 --> 00:55:58,455
This is gonna be tough.

784
00:55:58,664 --> 00:56:00,665
I have to get Garfield to buy this.

785
00:56:01,917 --> 00:56:05,462
He won't want to.
It's not to his advantage.

786
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:09,590
Talk nice.

787
00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:12,802
Give him your best smile.

788
00:56:14,512 --> 00:56:17,139
Come on, Kate.

789
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:19,308
Let's take on the little son of a bitch.

790
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:23,271
Let's kick his ass
all the way back to Wall Street.

791
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:54,175
It's a quiet place.

792
00:56:54,343 --> 00:56:58,013
I thought it would be a good idea
if we calmed down a bit.

793
00:56:58,222 --> 00:57:00,724
Do you like Japanese?

794
00:57:00,891 --> 00:57:02,851
I'd like to have Sony.

795
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:05,061
Could you bring me a knife and fork?

796
00:57:11,068 --> 00:57:13,069
So, what do you say?

797
00:57:14,905 --> 00:57:17,824
A proxy fight? I'd have to be nuts.

798
00:57:18,742 --> 00:57:21,536
I could sit on my ass and wait
for the injunction to lift...

799
00:57:21,703 --> 00:57:23,037
...buy all the shares I need.

800
00:57:23,205 --> 00:57:25,790
Anybody else,
I wouldn't even come to lunch.

801
00:57:27,375 --> 00:57:29,168
You look very nice today.

802
00:57:30,086 --> 00:57:33,714
But if you win, Lawrence,
it speeds up the process.

803
00:57:33,882 --> 00:57:38,219
You get what you want in three months
instead of a year, maybe two.

804
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:40,888
I love it when you call me Lawrence.

805
00:57:41,055 --> 00:57:42,347
Say it again.

806
00:57:46,102 --> 00:57:49,146
There's a lot can stand
in your way, Lawrence.

807
00:57:49,314 --> 00:57:51,232
Anti-takeover legislation's
in the works.

808
00:57:51,399 --> 00:57:53,651
Drexel's gone under. Milken's in jail.

809
00:57:53,818 --> 00:57:55,444
Trump's waiting tables.

810
00:57:55,611 --> 00:57:56,945
Don't threaten me.

811
00:57:57,155 --> 00:58:01,575
And just maybe you're over-leveraged,
and you can't afford to wait.

812
00:58:02,451 --> 00:58:05,287
- Thank you. You got any bread?
- No bread.

813
00:58:05,454 --> 00:58:07,038
No bread.

814
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:09,458
They got no bread.

815
00:58:09,667 --> 00:58:12,419
They wanna run the world,
they got no bread.

816
00:58:15,297 --> 00:58:19,509
In three weeks, you present your own slate.
If you win, you buy everybody out at 2O.

817
00:58:19,677 --> 00:58:22,137
If you lose, you sell us back
your shares at 1 5.

818
00:58:22,346 --> 00:58:25,515
Worst-case scenario,
you still make a couple million.

819
00:58:27,017 --> 00:58:29,185
Amazing people, the Japanese.

820
00:58:29,812 --> 00:58:31,146
We blow the hell out of them.

821
00:58:31,313 --> 00:58:34,357
They go back to school, learn English
and start to run the world.

822
00:58:34,524 --> 00:58:35,816
What do we do?

823
00:58:35,984 --> 00:58:38,611
We get bigheaded,
start living the good life.

824
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,154
Forget about schools.

825
00:58:40,322 --> 00:58:42,240
People can't read. People can't write.

826
00:58:42,449 --> 00:58:44,826
Country's full of dropouts.

827
00:58:44,951 --> 00:58:46,827
Education.

828
00:58:46,995 --> 00:58:50,081
Who needs education as long
as you can blow up the world?

829
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:54,085
Meanwhile, I got everybody
in my office learning Japanese.

830
00:58:56,629 --> 00:58:58,589
I've never seen such a beautiful lawyer.

831
00:59:00,717 --> 00:59:02,385
Come on, Lawrence.

832
00:59:02,552 --> 00:59:04,428
This is your game.

833
00:59:06,264 --> 00:59:08,265
Winner takes all.

834
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:13,395
Rumor has it, you got balls.

835
00:59:15,064 --> 00:59:17,649
I've been trying to show you for weeks.

836
00:59:18,776 --> 00:59:20,944
Well, here's your opportunity.

837
00:59:22,947 --> 00:59:24,865
All right.

838
00:59:25,074 --> 00:59:27,910
I can always use
a good proxy bloodbath.

839
00:59:28,077 --> 00:59:30,329
After all, I wanna give you
a fighting chance.

840
00:59:30,538 --> 00:59:32,665
I love you.

841
00:59:34,834 --> 00:59:36,502
Of course you do.

842
00:59:38,671 --> 00:59:40,798
Because we're the same.

843
00:59:43,008 --> 00:59:44,884
We are not the same, Lawrence.

844
00:59:45,052 --> 00:59:46,803
Now, don't go spreading that around.

845
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:48,846
You know what makes us the same...

846
00:59:49,014 --> 00:59:51,099
...what sets us apart?

847
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:55,520
We care more about the game
than we do the players.

848
00:59:57,105 --> 00:59:59,232
Oh, is that so?

849
01:00:00,067 --> 01:00:01,943
Yeah...

850
01:00:02,110 --> 01:00:04,237
...that's so.

851
01:00:16,791 --> 01:00:19,168
I'm gonna nail you, Lawrence...

852
01:00:19,878 --> 01:00:22,046
...and everybody
on Wall Street's gonna know...

853
01:00:22,255 --> 01:00:24,548
...some broad did you in.

854
01:00:28,845 --> 01:00:32,223
You're so perfect for me.

855
01:00:33,850 --> 01:00:36,727
- I have to go.
- Don't go.

856
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:40,314
Lunch is on me, baby-poo.

857
01:00:43,484 --> 01:00:44,860
Where you going?

858
01:00:45,236 --> 01:00:47,196
I have to go back to the office.

859
01:00:48,322 --> 01:00:50,907
Don't go back to the office.
Come and work for me.

860
01:01:02,378 --> 01:01:05,172
Lady said to say, "We have no doughnuts."

861
01:01:35,493 --> 01:01:37,786
Here's your coffee, boss.

862
01:01:44,502 --> 01:01:47,004
You make me feel like a dirty crook.

863
01:01:47,171 --> 01:01:50,465
Sneaking off to Jersey is not my style.

864
01:01:53,177 --> 01:01:55,512
Can we speak frankly?

865
01:01:56,305 --> 01:01:57,639
No. Lie to me.

866
01:01:57,807 --> 01:02:00,351
Tell me how thrilled you are
to know me.

867
01:02:00,518 --> 01:02:05,230
I always speak frankly. I hate people
who say, "Can we speak frankly?"

868
01:02:05,398 --> 01:02:08,734
It means they're bullshitting me
the rest of the time.

869
01:02:10,694 --> 01:02:12,695
I'm listening.

870
01:02:15,866 --> 01:02:17,367
Now...

871
01:02:18,744 --> 01:02:24,291
...as you know, I had 8O, OOO shares
of New England stock when we first met.

872
01:02:25,584 --> 01:02:29,212
What am I getting, a history lesson here?
Get to the point.

873
01:02:29,421 --> 01:02:35,385
Since becoming aware
of your investments...

874
01:02:35,552 --> 01:02:40,223
...I bought an additional 4O, OOO shares.
I now have 1 OO, OOO shares.

875
01:02:40,432 --> 01:02:42,934
Congratulations.

876
01:02:43,977 --> 01:02:46,270
I'm prepared...

877
01:02:48,356 --> 01:02:50,900
...to sell you the right...

878
01:02:51,484 --> 01:02:54,820
...to vote those shares
at the annual meeting.

879
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:58,366
How much?

880
01:03:01,202 --> 01:03:03,996
- A million.
- Too much.

881
01:03:04,163 --> 01:03:07,624
You need a million shares
more than you already own.

882
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:12,587
Now, I can get you 1 O percent
of the way there in one transaction.

883
01:03:12,755 --> 01:03:16,216
Better still, it's votes
they're counting on for themselves.

884
01:03:16,342 --> 01:03:19,678
They lose 1 O percent,
you gain 1 O percent.

885
01:03:19,845 --> 01:03:21,555
If you make a difference...

886
01:03:21,722 --> 01:03:24,975
...if I win by less than 1 OO, OOO votes,
you got your million.

887
01:03:25,101 --> 01:03:27,978
Otherwise, I don't need them,
I won't vote them.

888
01:03:28,145 --> 01:03:29,980
I'm not selling you an option.

889
01:03:30,147 --> 01:03:32,232
I'm selling you the right
to vote the shares.

890
01:03:32,399 --> 01:03:35,235
If they make a difference,
you got a million.

891
01:03:35,402 --> 01:03:38,905
If they don't, half a million.

892
01:03:44,703 --> 01:03:46,955
I've prepared the papers.

893
01:03:47,873 --> 01:03:51,543
Left the numbers blank.
You can have your lawyers look at them.

894
01:03:53,962 --> 01:03:57,131
Everybody looks out for their own
self-interest, don't they?

895
01:03:57,924 --> 01:04:01,510
"What's in it for me?"
Isn't that what it's finally all about?

896
01:04:19,571 --> 01:04:20,822
Yes. Very good. Very good.

897
01:04:20,989 --> 01:04:22,782
- When do we run in the Times?
- Tomorrow.

898
01:04:22,949 --> 01:04:25,659
- Times, Barron's, Forbes...
- Boston Herald.

899
01:04:25,827 --> 01:04:28,704
- Next week, major cities in New England.
- Great.

900
01:04:28,913 --> 01:04:32,333
Take this copy and slide it
all over to the right.

901
01:04:32,458 --> 01:04:34,751
And up in the corner here,
put that picture of me.

902
01:04:34,961 --> 01:04:37,088
- You know?
- You look good in that shot.

903
01:04:37,630 --> 01:04:39,840
Oh, God. Look at him.

904
01:04:40,007 --> 01:04:42,592
He's trying to look like Desmond Tutu.

905
01:04:49,767 --> 01:04:51,518
All right, Richard, get our ad agency.

906
01:04:51,685 --> 01:04:53,853
- Call Barbaro. Call Pinelli.
- Barbaro,  Pinelli.

907
01:04:53,979 --> 01:04:57,107
- Yeah. Where's that phone call from Tokyo?
- I'm on it,

908
01:05:16,585 --> 01:05:19,004
Taxi. Taxi!

909
01:05:30,807 --> 01:05:32,225
Thanks, Ron.

910
01:05:36,646 --> 01:05:38,856
Mr. Garfield's office.

911
01:05:39,023 --> 01:05:41,608
I expect him back at 5:3O.
Thanks, Connie.

912
01:05:41,776 --> 01:05:44,403
I'll ask him to phone you.
Bye-bye.

913
01:05:53,454 --> 01:05:55,789
Look, I found it. I found it.

914
01:05:57,708 --> 01:06:00,794
Mrs. Sullivan. She insisted
on waiting for you.

915
01:06:01,629 --> 01:06:04,798
I would appreciate a few moments
of your time.

916
01:06:05,383 --> 01:06:08,093
Certainly.
Hey, come on in the office.

917
01:06:09,095 --> 01:06:11,180
- Hold my calls.
- Will do.

918
01:06:12,473 --> 01:06:14,808
Come on in. Have a seat right there.

919
01:06:14,975 --> 01:06:17,894
Did your daughter send you?
Because she's full of clever moves.

920
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:21,440
No, she didn't. She would be
very upset with me if she knew.

921
01:06:22,107 --> 01:06:24,943
I like Kate. She's quite the tomato.

922
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:26,861
She must have taken after you, huh?

923
01:06:27,029 --> 01:06:28,405
You're very kind.

924
01:06:28,572 --> 01:06:32,283
I would hope this meeting
will be held in confidence.

925
01:06:32,451 --> 01:06:35,245
Everybody's looking
for confidence these days.

926
01:06:35,412 --> 01:06:37,413
You want a cup of coffee?

927
01:06:38,123 --> 01:06:41,292
- Cup of tea? Glass of water?
- You needn't be sociable, Mr. Garfield.

928
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:43,003
- Harriet, cup of coffee.
- Yes.

929
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:44,588
You mind if I smoke?

930
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:48,966
I'd like to tell you why I'm here.

931
01:06:50,093 --> 01:06:52,345
Good. Shoot.

932
01:06:57,851 --> 01:07:01,187
I'm here to plead for our company.

933
01:07:01,563 --> 01:07:05,817
I want to talk to you
about hopes and dreams...

934
01:07:06,109 --> 01:07:08,069
...traditions.

935
01:07:08,861 --> 01:07:11,446
Would you care for a doughnut,
Mrs. Sullivan?

936
01:07:11,614 --> 01:07:14,408
We've worked so hard
to build this company.

937
01:07:14,575 --> 01:07:16,952
We're debt-free...

938
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:20,121
...and we don't deserve to lose it.

939
01:07:20,581 --> 01:07:23,542
I want you to call off your fight with us.

940
01:07:26,504 --> 01:07:29,882
There's a trust fund in my name
with a million dollars in it.

941
01:07:30,049 --> 01:07:32,759
I'll turn it over to you if you go away.

942
01:07:33,302 --> 01:07:35,012
You don't wanna do that.

943
01:07:35,137 --> 01:07:39,849
We'll buy back your shares at cost,
plus you'll have a million dollars profit.

944
01:07:41,852 --> 01:07:43,061
Interesting.

945
01:07:43,479 --> 01:07:46,648
I know a million dollars
isn't much money to you...

946
01:07:46,773 --> 01:07:49,317
...but if I had more, I'd give it to you.

947
01:07:49,735 --> 01:07:51,319
Who are you doing it for?

948
01:07:52,195 --> 01:07:54,113
Money's not that important to me.

949
01:07:54,656 --> 01:07:58,326
- Well, it is to me.
- Then accept my offer.

950
01:07:58,618 --> 01:08:02,663
You'll have more money
than most people make in a lifetime.

951
01:08:02,831 --> 01:08:04,582
A million dollars.

952
01:08:05,292 --> 01:08:07,168
It's not enough.

953
01:08:08,378 --> 01:08:09,962
Go home, Mrs. Sullivan.

954
01:08:11,297 --> 01:08:14,174
I'd hoped to appeal
to your sense of decency.

955
01:08:15,218 --> 01:08:17,011
I'm sorry.

956
01:08:17,137 --> 01:08:20,974
I don't take money from widows
or orphans. I make them money.

957
01:08:21,516 --> 01:08:25,311
Before or after you put them out
of business?

958
01:08:45,164 --> 01:08:47,124
What a woman.

959
01:08:48,084 --> 01:08:51,462
Harriet, why do I always bring out
the best in people?

960
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:42,386
Hello?

961
01:09:43,471 --> 01:09:45,181
Hello?

962
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:47,891
Oh, please,

963
01:09:51,813 --> 01:09:53,314
Arthur!

964
01:09:53,481 --> 01:09:56,650
Get the car. Arthur.

965
01:10:02,406 --> 01:10:05,742
I'm sorry, sir. There's no answer
in Miss Sullivan's apartment.

966
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:08,746
Well, try it again.
Maybe you dialed it wrong.

967
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:16,170
No!

968
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:21,550
Excuse me, Bart.
What are you doing here?

969
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:24,511
- Who's Bart?
- I'm on my way out. You should've called.

970
01:10:24,678 --> 01:10:26,846
- I need to talk to you.
- I don't have time...

971
01:10:27,014 --> 01:10:29,724
I have something important to tell you.
I need to talk now.

972
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:33,395
- You look beautiful. Who's this guy?
- Excuse me, Lawrence. Call me tomorrow.

973
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:36,439
I can't talk tomorrow. It won't keep.

974
01:10:38,191 --> 01:10:40,192
I want you to marry me.

975
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:41,819
Let me put it another way.

976
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:44,155
I wanna marry you.

977
01:10:45,657 --> 01:10:47,075
You thinking it over?

978
01:10:47,951 --> 01:10:50,453
- What are you talking about?
- What do you mean?

979
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:53,956
I want you to be my wife.
We belong together.

980
01:10:54,666 --> 01:10:57,460
- I'm going to the opera. I gotta go.
- No, no, Kate.

981
01:10:59,504 --> 01:11:02,965
You're the last thought I have
when I fall asleep at night...

982
01:11:03,091 --> 01:11:06,010
...and the first when I wake up
in the morning.

983
01:11:06,469 --> 01:11:09,305
I wanna be with you forever and ever.

984
01:11:10,139 --> 01:11:12,599
I wanna have babies with you.

985
01:11:13,518 --> 01:11:16,145
- Babies?
- Yeah.

986
01:11:16,729 --> 01:11:21,191
You see, I gotta do this now,
because after I win...

987
01:11:21,359 --> 01:11:24,987
...maybe you won't wanna speak to me.
- You can't win. I'm gonna win.

988
01:11:25,196 --> 01:11:28,532
I know how important it is to you,
but you're not gonna win.

989
01:11:28,949 --> 01:11:30,617
This is what's killing me.

990
01:11:30,826 --> 01:11:34,329
I want you. I need you. I love you.
I just don't wanna lose you.

991
01:11:34,496 --> 01:11:37,332
- Katherine.
- Keep your pants on, will you, Bart?

992
01:11:37,499 --> 01:11:40,877
- I've gotta go.
- All right, the opera. La Traviata.

993
01:11:41,045 --> 01:11:44,506
You don't wanna miss the first act.
It sets up the whole thing.

994
01:11:58,228 --> 01:12:00,229
It's a wonderful production.

995
01:12:04,734 --> 01:12:06,610
Have a good time.

996
01:12:53,365 --> 01:12:55,575
I'm gonna lose her, Arthur.

997
01:13:28,858 --> 01:13:30,776
Oh, I've been looking for you.

998
01:13:31,861 --> 01:13:33,737
Anytime you're ready.

999
01:13:35,573 --> 01:13:37,199
You okay?

1000
01:13:38,201 --> 01:13:39,619
Yeah.

1001
01:13:39,786 --> 01:13:42,496
Just going over in my mind
what I wanna say.

1002
01:13:42,664 --> 01:13:44,832
They're putting speakers outside.

1003
01:13:45,458 --> 01:13:49,169
I think every shareholder
within driving distance is coming.

1004
01:13:49,337 --> 01:13:52,757
I feel as if we're Harry and Bess
on election night.

1005
01:13:52,924 --> 01:13:56,886
Harry Truman was a better man than me.
He slept on election night.

1006
01:13:57,094 --> 01:13:59,888
I haven't slept in days.

1007
01:14:00,973 --> 01:14:04,351
Talk to me. Tell me.

1008
01:14:06,771 --> 01:14:08,689
I'm scared.

1009
01:14:10,274 --> 01:14:12,109
I'm scared that...

1010
01:14:14,737 --> 01:14:17,364
...time has passed us by.

1011
01:14:20,075 --> 01:14:23,495
I'm scared I don't know
this new environment.

1012
01:14:23,954 --> 01:14:27,916
I'm scared that what I do know
doesn't count for anything anymore.

1013
01:14:28,083 --> 01:14:30,168
Things have changed.

1014
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:35,549
Whatever happened
to people serving each other?

1015
01:14:38,844 --> 01:14:42,430
I don't want this man to win.

1016
01:14:44,391 --> 01:14:46,184
I'm not scared.

1017
01:14:46,351 --> 01:14:48,436
I'm just proud.

1018
01:14:50,021 --> 01:14:53,315
I'm proud of the business we've built.

1019
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,485
I'm so proud of you.

1020
01:14:57,445 --> 01:15:00,614
And if what we are
counts for nothing anymore...

1021
01:15:00,782 --> 01:15:03,284
...then that's their failing, not ours.

1022
01:15:06,412 --> 01:15:08,330
It'll be all right.

1023
01:15:09,415 --> 01:15:11,500
Just go out and tell the truth.

1024
01:15:14,712 --> 01:15:17,214
Go out and give them hell, Harry.

1025
01:15:25,931 --> 01:15:28,058
Good luck to us all today, Bill.

1026
01:15:28,225 --> 01:15:31,436
I feel we're gonna be just fine.

1027
01:15:36,608 --> 01:15:40,403
Looks like they've come from everywhere.
New York, Boston.

1028
01:15:40,529 --> 01:15:44,574
- There's Ozzie.
- Happening all over, isn't it?

1029
01:15:44,908 --> 01:15:47,243
Everybody looking out for themselves.

1030
01:15:51,331 --> 01:15:54,333
So did you get
your golden parachute, Bill?

1031
01:15:54,501 --> 01:15:56,586
Did he finally promise to take care of you?

1032
01:15:57,838 --> 01:16:00,590
Lord of the manor, house on the hill.

1033
01:16:01,424 --> 01:16:06,470
Said he didn't want to talk about a funeral
while there was no corpse.

1034
01:16:14,312 --> 01:16:17,440
Well, time to go.

1035
01:16:19,067 --> 01:16:20,610
Bill.

1036
01:16:22,987 --> 01:16:24,363
How you gonna vote?

1037
01:16:44,925 --> 01:16:48,636
Oh, boy. They're out in droves, Arthur.
They got the kids here.

1038
01:16:48,762 --> 01:16:50,972
Why do they always bring the kids,
Arthur?

1039
01:16:54,685 --> 01:16:58,480
That's right. Hooray, hooray.
Down with Garfield.

1040
01:17:10,325 --> 01:17:11,951
Okay, TV crews.

1041
01:17:12,119 --> 01:17:14,037
Financial News Network, here we come.

1042
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:21,961
Mr. Garfield!

1043
01:17:22,128 --> 01:17:24,505
What are your plans
for New England Wire and Cable?

1044
01:17:24,673 --> 01:17:25,965
Make the stockholders richer.

1045
01:17:26,132 --> 01:17:30,177
Will you liquidate New England Wire and
Cable? And if so, what about the workers?

1046
01:17:30,387 --> 01:17:34,474
My obligation is to the stockholders.
The board of directors make that decision.

1047
01:17:34,641 --> 01:17:36,392
Oh, come on!

1048
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:41,105
What about the workers?

1049
01:17:41,272 --> 01:17:44,108
Are they gonna lose their jobs?
Come on, answer the question.

1050
01:17:44,275 --> 01:17:46,235
Come on, Mr. Garfield!

1051
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:50,197
How do you feel about the outcome
of today's proxy vote?

1052
01:17:50,323 --> 01:17:53,826
I feel confident that the shareholders
will vote their consciences.

1053
01:17:53,993 --> 01:17:56,203
I have every confidence
in this company's future.

1054
01:18:37,077 --> 01:18:39,329
Could I have your attention, please?

1055
01:18:39,496 --> 01:18:41,080
Welcome to...

1056
01:18:41,248 --> 01:18:45,377
...New England Wire and Cable's
annual stockholders' meeting.

1057
01:18:45,543 --> 01:18:49,797
I'm William J. Coles, your president,
and I'm sure...

1058
01:18:51,132 --> 01:18:55,094
I'm sure that everyone here realizes
the most important item on the agenda...

1059
01:18:55,553 --> 01:18:58,097
...is the election
of the board of directors.

1060
01:18:58,264 --> 01:19:03,519
Now, there are staff members
passing out the ballots.

1061
01:19:03,978 --> 01:19:07,523
Right now, I am very proud
to introduce to you...

1062
01:19:07,732 --> 01:19:12,987
...a man who could accurately
be characterized as a legend...

1063
01:19:13,196 --> 01:19:15,239
...in the wire and cable industry.

1064
01:19:15,656 --> 01:19:19,534
The chairman of the board
of New England Wire and Cable...

1065
01:19:19,702 --> 01:19:21,286
...Mr. Andrew Jorgenson.

1066
01:19:44,017 --> 01:19:45,393
Give them hell, Andy!

1067
01:19:47,187 --> 01:19:49,981
It's good to see so many...

1068
01:19:50,148 --> 01:19:53,568
...familiar faces, so many old friends.

1069
01:19:54,027 --> 01:19:56,946
Some of you I haven't seen in years.

1070
01:19:57,114 --> 01:19:59,115
Thank you for coming.

1071
01:19:59,241 --> 01:20:04,079
Bill Coles, our able president,
in the annual report, has told you...

1072
01:20:04,204 --> 01:20:08,041
...of our year, of what we accomplished,
of the need for further improvements...

1073
01:20:08,208 --> 01:20:13,212
...our business goals for next year
and the years beyond.

1074
01:20:18,593 --> 01:20:21,554
I'd like to talk to you
about something else.

1075
01:20:23,306 --> 01:20:25,808
I want to share with you
some of my thoughts...

1076
01:20:26,017 --> 01:20:31,647
...concerning the vote that you're going
to make in the company that you own.

1077
01:20:31,939 --> 01:20:37,444
This proud company, which has survived
the death of its founder,,,

1078
01:20:37,611 --> 01:20:42,907
,,, numerous recessions,
one major depression and two world wars,,,

1079
01:20:43,534 --> 01:20:49,247
,,, is in imminent danger
of self-destructing,

1080
01:20:49,957 --> 01:20:54,377
On this day, in the town of its birth,

1081
01:20:58,590 --> 01:21:02,593
There is the instrument
of our destruction.

1082
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:08,558
I want you to look at him in all of his glory.
"Larry the Liquidator."

1083
01:21:08,892 --> 01:21:14,856
The entrepreneur of post-industrial America
playing God...

1084
01:21:15,023 --> 01:21:17,817
...with other people's money.

1085
01:21:19,694 --> 01:21:25,407
The robber barons of old at least
left something tangible in their wake.

1086
01:21:25,784 --> 01:21:29,120
A coal mine, a railroad, banks.

1087
01:21:29,996 --> 01:21:32,248
This man leaves nothing.

1088
01:21:32,415 --> 01:21:35,626
He creates nothing.
He builds nothing.

1089
01:21:35,793 --> 01:21:38,253
He runs nothing.

1090
01:21:39,797 --> 01:21:45,093
And in his wake lies nothing
but a blizzard of paper to cover the pain.

1091
01:21:45,303 --> 01:21:51,308
Oh, if he said, "I know how to run
your business better than you"...

1092
01:21:51,475 --> 01:21:54,060
...that would be something
worth talking about...

1093
01:21:54,228 --> 01:21:56,188
...but he's not saying that.

1094
01:21:56,355 --> 01:22:02,194
He's saying, "I'm gonna kill you
because at this particular moment in time...

1095
01:22:02,319 --> 01:22:05,029
...you're worth more dead than alive."

1096
01:22:05,197 --> 01:22:06,698
Well...

1097
01:22:07,157 --> 01:22:10,785
...maybe that's true, but it is also true...

1098
01:22:10,953 --> 01:22:14,873
...that one day this industry will turn.

1099
01:22:15,082 --> 01:22:20,086
One day when the yen is weaker,
the dollar is stronger...

1100
01:22:20,295 --> 01:22:25,716
...or when we finally begin
to rebuild our roads, our bridges...

1101
01:22:25,926 --> 01:22:30,513
...the infrastructure of our country,
demand will skyrocket.

1102
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:35,185
And when those things happen,
we will still be here...

1103
01:22:35,393 --> 01:22:40,981
...stronger because of our ordeal,
stronger because we have survived.

1104
01:22:41,149 --> 01:22:46,946
And the price of our stock
will make his offer pale by comparison.

1105
01:22:47,447 --> 01:22:53,035
God save us if we vote to take
his paltry few dollars and run.

1106
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:59,166
God save this country
if that is truly the wave of the future.

1107
01:22:59,459 --> 01:23:02,670
We will then have become a nation
that makes nothing but hamburgers...

1108
01:23:02,795 --> 01:23:07,799
...creates nothing but lawyers
and sells nothing but tax shelters.

1109
01:23:07,967 --> 01:23:12,638
And if we are at that point in this country
where we kill something...

1110
01:23:12,805 --> 01:23:18,310
...because at the moment
it's worth more dead than alive...

1111
01:23:18,436 --> 01:23:19,979
...well...

1112
01:23:20,354 --> 01:23:23,732
...take a look around. Look at your
neighbor. Look at your neighbor.

1113
01:23:23,899 --> 01:23:26,943
You won't kill him, will you? No.

1114
01:23:27,111 --> 01:23:29,988
It's called murder, and it's illegal.

1115
01:23:30,114 --> 01:23:34,159
Well, this, too, is murder,
on a mass scale.

1116
01:23:34,326 --> 01:23:40,748
Only on Wall Street,
they call it maximizing shareholder value...

1117
01:23:40,999 --> 01:23:43,084
...and they call it legal.

1118
01:23:43,252 --> 01:23:47,672
And they substitute dollar bills
where a conscience should be.

1119
01:23:48,382 --> 01:23:50,050
Damn it!

1120
01:23:50,258 --> 01:23:54,512
A business is worth more
than the price of its stock.

1121
01:23:55,388 --> 01:23:59,266
It's the place where we earn our living,
where we meet our friends...

1122
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:01,769
...dream our dreams.

1123
01:24:01,937 --> 01:24:07,400
It is, in every sense, the very fabric
that binds our society together.

1124
01:24:07,984 --> 01:24:10,945
So let us now, at this meeting...

1125
01:24:11,112 --> 01:24:14,865
...say to every Garfield in the land...

1126
01:24:15,033 --> 01:24:20,121
...here, we build things,
we don't destroy them.

1127
01:24:20,288 --> 01:24:24,625
Here, we care about more
than the price of our stock.

1128
01:24:25,084 --> 01:24:26,752
Here...

1129
01:24:28,045 --> 01:24:30,213
...we care about people.

1130
01:24:54,863 --> 01:24:56,239
Thank you.

1131
01:24:57,991 --> 01:25:02,495
And now I'd like to introduce
Mr. Lawrence Garfield.

1132
01:25:02,663 --> 01:25:05,665
Mr. Gar...
Excuse... Please.

1133
01:25:05,832 --> 01:25:08,834
Let's show a little courtesy,
ladies and gentlemen.

1134
01:25:09,711 --> 01:25:13,589
Mr. Garfield is the president
and the chairman of the board...

1135
01:25:13,965 --> 01:25:16,258
...of Garfield Investments.

1136
01:25:16,426 --> 01:25:18,302
Mr. Garfield.

1137
01:25:39,907 --> 01:25:41,575
Amen.

1138
01:25:42,952 --> 01:25:44,703
And amen.

1139
01:25:45,663 --> 01:25:47,331
And amen.

1140
01:25:47,540 --> 01:25:51,210
You have to forgive me.
I'm not familiar with the local custom.

1141
01:25:51,377 --> 01:25:56,173
Where I come from, you always say amen
after you hear a prayer.

1142
01:25:57,008 --> 01:25:59,552
Because that's what you just heard.

1143
01:25:59,719 --> 01:26:01,470
A prayer.

1144
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:05,432
Where I come from...

1145
01:26:06,183 --> 01:26:11,563
...that particular prayer
is called the prayer for the dead.

1146
01:26:13,482 --> 01:26:17,861
You just heard the prayer for the dead,
my fellow stockholders...

1147
01:26:18,028 --> 01:26:20,530
...and you didn't say amen.

1148
01:26:21,865 --> 01:26:24,158
This company is dead.

1149
01:26:24,868 --> 01:26:27,704
I didn't kill it. Don't blame me.

1150
01:26:27,871 --> 01:26:30,581
It was dead when I got here.

1151
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:36,462
It's too late for prayers.

1152
01:26:39,341 --> 01:26:43,178
For even if the prayers were answered
and a miracle occurred...

1153
01:26:43,345 --> 01:26:45,805
...and the yen did this
and the dollar did that...

1154
01:26:45,972 --> 01:26:50,101
...and the infrastructure did the other thing,
we would still be dead.

1155
01:26:50,643 --> 01:26:52,227
You know why?

1156
01:26:53,730 --> 01:26:55,815
Fiber optics.

1157
01:26:56,190 --> 01:26:58,775
New technologies.

1158
01:27:00,361 --> 01:27:02,863
Obsolescence.

1159
01:27:04,157 --> 01:27:05,867
We're dead, all right.

1160
01:27:05,992 --> 01:27:07,827
We're just not broke.

1161
01:27:07,994 --> 01:27:11,455
And do you know the surest way
to go broke?

1162
01:27:11,664 --> 01:27:15,292
Keep getting an increasing share
of a shrinking market.

1163
01:27:15,501 --> 01:27:17,419
Down the tubes.

1164
01:27:17,670 --> 01:27:20,589
Slow but sure.

1165
01:27:20,756 --> 01:27:22,549
You know, at one time...

1166
01:27:22,716 --> 01:27:26,511
...there must have been dozens
of companies making buggy whips.

1167
01:27:28,389 --> 01:27:31,600
And I'll bet the last company around
was the one that made...

1168
01:27:31,767 --> 01:27:35,020
...the best goddamn buggy whip
you ever saw.

1169
01:27:35,187 --> 01:27:39,149
Now, how would you have liked to have
been a stockholder in that company?

1170
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:44,028
You invested in a business,
and this business is dead.

1171
01:27:44,154 --> 01:27:47,657
Let's have the intelligence,
let's have the decency...

1172
01:27:48,158 --> 01:27:51,077
...to sign the death certificate,
collect the insurance...

1173
01:27:51,244 --> 01:27:54,288
...and invest in something with a future.

1174
01:27:56,333 --> 01:27:59,544
"But we can't," goes the prayer.

1175
01:28:01,296 --> 01:28:04,549
We can't, because
we have a responsibility...

1176
01:28:04,716 --> 01:28:09,136
...a responsibility to our employees,
to our community.

1177
01:28:09,304 --> 01:28:10,680
What will happen to them?

1178
01:28:11,681 --> 01:28:14,100
I got two words for that:

1179
01:28:14,267 --> 01:28:16,686
Who cares?

1180
01:28:17,228 --> 01:28:19,772
Care about them? Why?

1181
01:28:19,939 --> 01:28:21,940
They didn't care about you.

1182
01:28:22,108 --> 01:28:24,401
They sucked you dry.

1183
01:28:24,986 --> 01:28:26,987
You have no responsibility to them.

1184
01:28:27,155 --> 01:28:31,826
For the last 1 O years,
this company bled your money.

1185
01:28:32,326 --> 01:28:36,204
Did this community ever say,
"We know times are tough.

1186
01:28:36,455 --> 01:28:40,375
We'll lower taxes,
reduce water and sewer"?

1187
01:28:40,543 --> 01:28:44,213
Check it out. You're paying
twice what you did 1 O years ago.

1188
01:28:44,964 --> 01:28:49,468
And our devoted employees who have taken
no increases for the past three years...

1189
01:28:49,593 --> 01:28:52,512
...are still making twice
what they made 1 O years ago.

1190
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:58,185
And our stock,
one-sixth what it was 1 O years ago.

1191
01:29:00,521 --> 01:29:02,397
Who cares?

1192
01:29:03,023 --> 01:29:04,899
I'll tell you.

1193
01:29:05,108 --> 01:29:06,692
Me.

1194
01:29:07,778 --> 01:29:10,447
I'm not your best friend.

1195
01:29:10,906 --> 01:29:13,116
I'm your only friend.

1196
01:29:15,410 --> 01:29:17,620
I don't make anything?

1197
01:29:17,913 --> 01:29:19,748
I'm making you money.

1198
01:29:19,873 --> 01:29:22,292
And lest we forget,
that's the only reason...

1199
01:29:22,459 --> 01:29:25,753
...any of you became stockholders
in the first place.

1200
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:27,880
You want to make money.

1201
01:29:28,047 --> 01:29:34,386
You don't care if they manufacture wire
and cable, fried chicken or grow tangerines!

1202
01:29:34,512 --> 01:29:36,931
You wanna make money!

1203
01:29:38,057 --> 01:29:42,394
I'm the only friend you've got.
I'm making you money.

1204
01:29:43,312 --> 01:29:44,813
Take the money.

1205
01:29:44,981 --> 01:29:47,441
Invest it somewhere else.

1206
01:29:48,067 --> 01:29:49,610
Maybe...

1207
01:29:49,819 --> 01:29:53,197
Maybe you'll get lucky,
and it'll be used productively.

1208
01:29:54,281 --> 01:29:58,910
And if it is, you'll create new jobs
and provide a service for the economy...

1209
01:29:59,078 --> 01:30:03,207
...and, God forbid,
even make a few bucks for yourselves.

1210
01:30:06,168 --> 01:30:11,339
And if anybody asks,
tell them you gave at the plant.

1211
01:30:12,966 --> 01:30:14,258
And by the way...

1212
01:30:14,426 --> 01:30:20,557
...it pleases me that I am called
"Larry the Liquidator."

1213
01:30:21,016 --> 01:30:23,226
You know why, fellow stockholders?

1214
01:30:23,393 --> 01:30:25,353
Because at my funeral...

1215
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:30,024
...you'll leave with a smile on your face
and a few bucks in your pocket.

1216
01:30:30,150 --> 01:30:32,652
Now, that's a funeral worth having.

1217
01:30:47,959 --> 01:30:49,585
The ballots will be marked...

1218
01:30:49,711 --> 01:30:54,715
...and deposited in the ballot boxes
at the rear of the hall. Thank you.

1219
01:31:41,595 --> 01:31:45,432
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

1220
01:31:45,974 --> 01:31:48,101
May I have your attention, please?

1221
01:31:49,186 --> 01:31:52,022
I will now read
the results of the balloting.

1222
01:32:04,284 --> 01:32:07,120
To retain the present board:

1223
01:32:07,287 --> 01:32:11,958
1,741, 418.

1224
01:32:12,125 --> 01:32:17,880
For the opposition: 2,21 9,9O1.

1225
01:32:18,047 --> 01:32:23,302
Not voting: 1 78, 111.

1226
01:32:23,428 --> 01:32:27,014
Mr. Garfield, your slate is elected.

1227
01:32:51,872 --> 01:32:54,332
Congratulations, Mr. Garfield.

1228
01:32:54,541 --> 01:32:55,708
Congratulations, Lawrence.

1229
01:34:41,146 --> 01:34:43,189
You okay, boss?

1230
01:34:48,570 --> 01:34:50,738
You want some chicken soup
or something?

1231
01:34:50,864 --> 01:34:52,407
No.

1232
01:34:52,574 --> 01:34:53,992
Pie?

1233
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:55,868
No.

1234
01:34:57,829 --> 01:35:00,248
How about some of that carrot cake
you like so much?

1235
01:35:04,377 --> 01:35:05,586
No.

1236
01:35:55,552 --> 01:35:58,179
Well, Carmen, we did it again.

1237
01:35:58,805 --> 01:36:01,641
I can always count on you, can't I?

1238
01:36:02,142 --> 01:36:04,769
Another barrelful of money.

1239
01:36:05,770 --> 01:36:08,480
Not bad for a kid from the Bronx.

1240
01:36:12,527 --> 01:36:14,487
I love money.

1241
01:36:15,738 --> 01:36:17,573
I love money.

1242
01:36:17,699 --> 01:36:21,577
Mr, Garfield,  Kate Sullivan is on the line,

1243
01:36:24,956 --> 01:36:27,458
Are you in or out,  Mr, Garfield?

1244
01:36:29,585 --> 01:36:34,798
- Hello?
- You're a greedy, arrogant, self-absorbed...

1245
01:36:34,965 --> 01:36:37,133
- ,,, overbearing...
- Avaricious?

1246
01:36:37,259 --> 01:36:38,885
I have a proposition for you,

1247
01:36:39,553 --> 01:36:41,805
Are you ready, Lawrence?

1248
01:36:41,972 --> 01:36:43,682
Ready,

1249
01:36:44,850 --> 01:36:46,059
Air bags.

1250
01:36:46,769 --> 01:36:48,604
Air bags?

1251
01:36:48,771 --> 01:36:51,190
Every car in America
is about to have one,

1252
01:36:51,356 --> 01:36:55,151
Did you know that air bags
are made from stainless-steel wire cloth?

1253
01:36:56,111 --> 01:36:57,487
Did you dump Bart?

1254
01:36:59,573 --> 01:37:03,576
The Mitsushimi Company of Japan
is ready to make a long-term deal...

1255
01:37:03,702 --> 01:37:05,620
...with New England Wire and Cable...

1256
01:37:05,912 --> 01:37:09,957
,,, for the production of air bags,

1257
01:37:10,375 --> 01:37:12,668
I love the sound of your voice.

1258
01:37:12,836 --> 01:37:15,672
Well,  here comes the best part,
Lawrence,

1259
01:37:16,047 --> 01:37:19,717
You sell Wire and Cable
back to the employees.

1260
01:37:19,884 --> 01:37:25,973
They modernize and re-equip the plant
and turn out air bags.

1261
01:37:26,099 --> 01:37:27,975
What's in it for me?

1262
01:37:28,101 --> 01:37:30,978
They'll pay 28 bucks a share,

1263
01:37:31,437 --> 01:37:33,105
You like?

1264
01:37:33,940 --> 01:37:35,816
They'll go to 3O.

1265
01:37:36,234 --> 01:37:38,736
Thirty? You think so?

1266
01:37:39,195 --> 01:37:42,239
Why not? We'll talk about it at dinner.
I'll see you in an hour.

1267
01:37:42,657 --> 01:37:45,701
Lunch, tomorrow, 1: OO.

1268
01:37:45,868 --> 01:37:48,870
You know where. Strictly business.

1269
01:37:49,038 --> 01:37:51,248
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Strictly business.

1270
01:37:51,415 --> 01:37:53,250
Wow, did you hear that, Carmen?

1271
01:37:53,459 --> 01:37:57,421
Harriet! Call my manicurist,
call the barber, call the florist...

1272
01:37:57,588 --> 01:38:00,924
...tell Arthur I want two tickets
to the opera tomorrow night. Puccini.

1273
01:38:01,091 --> 01:38:03,426
We're back in business!

1274
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:10,184
It's money that I love.
