如果有人被杀了怎么办

是的,你是。

101
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,170
就因为你爸是他妈的马库斯·班克斯警长
Just because your dad was Chief fucking Marcus Banks

102
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,540
不代表你就能逃出来。

103
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,240
别再提我父亲了，好吗
Stop making this about my father, okay

104

他走了，你现在是系主任了。

是的，12年。
Yes  Twelve fucking years.

108
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,980
十二年前，我告发了一个坏警察，
Twelve years ago, I turned in a dirty cop,

109
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,450
我因此得到一枚奖章。大不了他妈的
I get a medal for it. Big fucking deal

110
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,290
我还有一颗子弹
I also got a bullet,

111
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,160
我得在以后的职业生涯中小心翼翼
and I got to look over my back for the rest of my career.

112
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,920

这里他妈的太热了
It is too fucking hot in here

114

让我听你胡扯。

我有一股热浪。

117
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,500
这个城市疯了。停止

00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,170
他就是我当初想做这件事的原因。
He's why I wanted to do this in the first place.

140
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,010
我也不是他。
And I'm not him.

141
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,380
准备好不被打动。
Prepare to be underwhelmed.

142
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,410
银行和Schenk……
Banks and Schenk...

143
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,380
有个流浪汉被3号火车撞了。你起来。
Some homeless guy got hit by the 3 train. You're up.

144
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,520
彼得森侦探,
Detective Peterson,

145
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,390
拿221。彼得森侦探,221年。
pick up 221. Detective Peterson, 221.

146
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,330
这是你
This is you

147
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,670
比警车还厉害。
Beats the squad car.

148
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,640
班克斯警探正在去1019的路上。
Detective Banks en route to that 1019.

149
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,670
是在街道的北面还是南面
Would that be north or south side of the street

150
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:46,740
向北。收到
Northbound. Copy that.

151
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,110
你在干什么?
What are you doing

152
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,410
哦，只是家人。
Oh, it's just family.

153
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:53,320
这是我妻子，艾玛，这是我儿子，查理。
This is my wife, Emma, this is my son, Charlie.

154
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,420
他们是可爱的。趁它还在的时候好好享受吧。
They're cute. Enjoy it while it lasts.

155
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,150
“虽然持续”
"While it lasts"

156
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:01,360
没有比新警探的妻子更幸福的事了，
Nothing happier than the wife of a new detective,

157
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,660
没有比这更愤怒的了
and nothing more angry

158
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,100
比十年后的那个婊子强多了。
than that same bitch 10 years later.

159
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,600
也许是因为你管她们叫贱人。
Maybe it's 'cause you call them bitches.

160
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,330
我是半个意大利人，相信我。
I'm halfItalian, trust me.

161
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,070
女人不喜欢你叫她们婊子…
Women do not like it when you call them bitches...

162
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,070
你在跟我说什么女人，
What are you telling me about women,

163
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,040
年轻的草泥马屎。
young motherfucker  Shit.

164
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,240
我只是对你说的，不是对女人说的。
I just said it to you, I didn't say it to a woman.

165
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,040
我不会当着他们的面说。我又不是太矮。
I don't say it to their face. It's not like I'm Too Short.

166
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,350
我们才刚认识，但是，你已经解雇我了，我很感激。
We just met, but, you know, you're firing already, and I appreciate it.

167
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,710
我是说，我想说的是，
I mean, all I'm saying is, you know,

168
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,220
大多数犯罪发生在周末，假期，
most crime happens on weekends, holidays,

169
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,380
所以你会认为嫁给警察的人
so you would think anybody married to a cop

170
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,190
会明白这一点。
would understand this.

171
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,490
但是没有。
But no.

172
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,520
总有一天，你老婆会生气的
One day, your wife will be angry

173
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,430
因为你不能去参加她姐姐的生日晚宴
'cause you couldn't go to her sister's birthday dinner.

174
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,560
你可以给一个女人600个星期二。
You can give a woman 600 Tuesdays.

175
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,700
这不值三个周六晚上。
It ain't worth three Saturday nights.

176
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,340
所以,嗯…我猜你离婚了。
So, uh... I'm guessing you're divorced.

177
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:55,710
离婚了，不，还没有。我要离婚了。
Divorced, no, not yet. I'm going through a divorce.

178
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,680
那会更糟糕。这有点像化疗。
That's even worse. It's kind of like chemo.

179
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,650
大便。对不起。
Shit. Sorry.

180
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,560
抱歉，我们是警察。这是我们选择的生活。
Sorry for what  We're cops. This is the life we choose.

181
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,290
最高的离婚率和自杀率。
Highest divorce rate, highest suicide rate.

182
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,230
家庭暴力发生率最高。
Highest rate of domestic violence.

183
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,330
你决定当警察的时候，
Yo, when you decided to become a cop,

184
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,500
你已经很自信了
you pretty much assured yourself

185
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,300
你会孤独终老。
you were gonna die alone.

186
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,370
我妻子和我，我们要做心理咨询。
My wife and I, we're doing this counseling.

187
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,740
她让我，呃，研究交流之类的。
She's got me, uh, working on, like, communication.

188
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,380
是啊，那很好。
Counseling  Yeah, that's nice.

189
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,510
是啊，我老婆上了辅导员。
Yeah, my wife fucked the counselor.

190
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,820
他妈的,真的
Fuck, really

191
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,450
是的。耶稣。
Yeah.  Jesus.

192
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,190
女人欺骗。
Women cheat, too.

193
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:40,290
这很伤我的心。该死，好疼。
It hurts. God damn it, it hurts.

194
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,160
女人也会出轨，但事实是这样的。
Women cheat, too, but here's what happens.

195
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,160
女人白天出轨。
Women cheat in the daytime.

196
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,230
你白天做了很多事都能逃脱惩罚。
You can get away with a lot of shit in the daytime.

197
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,600
这是正确的。你可以骑
That's right. You can ride

198
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,540
黄昏前有很多鸡巴。嗯。
a lot of dick before dusk.  Mmmhmm.

199
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:58,810
妈的，我才发现普拉提根本不存在。
Shit, man, I just found out Pilates doesn't even exist.

200
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,140
等,严重
Wait, seriously

201
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,510
艾玛喜欢普拉提。
Emma loves Pilates.

202
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,380
我相信她会的。我相信她会的。
I'm sure she does. I'm sure she does.

203
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,350
不过别担心。
But don't worry about it.

204
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,190
你会没事的。你会永远结婚。
You're gonna be fine. You gonna be married forever.

205
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,160
我们得到了什么
What do we got

206
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,360
你自己看。
See for yourself.

207
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,900
看你自己。
Watch yourself.

208
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,910
如果你要吐，就别在证据上吐。
If you're gonna throw up, don't do it on the evidence.

209
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,550
你在开玩笑吧
Are you kidding me

210
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,820
我从12岁起就一直梦想着这个。
I've been dreaming about this since I was 12 years old.

211
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,390
啊。
Ugh.

212
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,260
你可以在地铁上看到很多电视机
You see a lot of TV sets on the subway

213
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,390
所有东西都在这里。
You get everything down here.

214
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,660
该死的。哇。
Damn. Wow.

215
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,730
啊。
Ugh.

216
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,180
这个混蛋很难认出来。
This bum's gonna be tough to ID.

217
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,480
我不确定这是不是流浪汉。
I'm not too sure this is a bum.

218
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:13,620
我不知道有多少流浪汉想要加入。
I don't know a lot of bums trying to get their steps in.

219
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:17,450
不管是谁，已经结婚了…
Whoever this is, is married...

220
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,390
戴着Fitbit。
and wears a Fitbit.

221
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,490
这个包裹刚到。
This package just came in.

222
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,920
对我来说是的。
For me Yeah.

223
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,330
那是什么
What is that

224
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,940
“打我。”
"Play me."

225
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,350
好吧。哇,哇。你在干什么?
Okay.  Whoa, whoa. What are you doing

226
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,650
我可不想弄坏我的电脑。
Don't want to fuck up my computer.

227
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,690
你好,侦探银行。
Hello, Detective Banks.

228
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,630
我是来帮助改革警局的，
I'm here to help reform the Metro Police,

229
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:32,360
提醒他们记住他们对这座城市人民的誓言。
to remind them of their oath to the people of this city.

230
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,930
你局里的一名警官拒绝改过自新。
One officer from your station refused to be reformed.

231
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,800
他不会是最后一个玩我游戏的人。
He will not be the last to play my game.

232
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,970
如果那个螺旋是我想的那样…
If that spiral is what I think it is...

233
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,610
拼图
Jigsaw

234
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,080
等等，我以为竖锯杀手已经死了
Wait, I thought the Jigsaw killer was dead

235
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,910
但如果是另一个模仿者
Yeah, but if it's another copycat...

236
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,680
这将是一场糟糕的演出。
It's gonna be a shit show.

237
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,780
我认得那栋建筑。
I recognize that building.

238
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,050
这是法院。
It's the courthouse.

239
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,280
我们去看看。
Let's check it out.

240
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,010
你们在这里做什么
What are you guys doing here

241
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,570
我们觉得你们可能需要支援。
Well, we thought you boys might need some backup.

242
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,640
去你的，费奇，这不是你的案子。
Fuck you, Fitch, it's not your case.

243
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,980
哟,齐克。
Yo, Zeke.

244
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,760
这是什么
What do we got here

245
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,900
那是什么鬼东西
What the fuck is that

246
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,470
那是他妈的舌头吗
Is that a fucking tongue

247
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,580
他妈的狗屎。
Fucking shit.

248
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,620
453年……谁是453
453... Who's 453

249
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:08,860
圆了
Circle up

250
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,100
好吧，这是我们所知道的。
Okay, here's what we know.

251
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,030
牙科记录证实是博兹。
Dental records confirm it's Boz.

252
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,000
对不起,伙计们。
Sorry, guys.

253
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:20,700
但是，听着，我们得抓住那个干这事的混蛋。
But, look, we got to catch the son of a bitch that did this.

254
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,710
列车员说他没看到什么。
Train conductor says he didn't see much.

255
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,040
他说他看到博兹悬在空中
Says he saw Boz hanging in the air

256
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,810
就在他撞到挡风玻璃之前。
right before he hit the windshield.

257
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,980
他说他看到博兹的嘴在流血。
Says he thinks he saw Boz bleeding from the mouth badly.

258
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:30,410
这个包裹是由快递公司寄出的
The package was sent from a delivery service

259
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,880
在昂格林大道的门廊上捡到的。
that picked it up on a stoop on Anglin Drive.

260
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,480
那螺旋呢
What about the spirals

261
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,050
队长，很明显是拼图游戏的模仿者，
Hey, Cap, obviously it's a Jigsaw copycat,

262
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,160
这就是我们要集中精力的地方。
so that's where we got to concentrate our focus.

263
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,620
当然，费奇，但我希望你坚持确凿的证据。
Sure, Fitch, but I want you to stick with hard evidence.

264
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,190
克劳斯，联系联调局，了解他们的情况。

文件，旧视频，任何东西。
Files, old videos, anything.

266
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,430
我们有街道图片吗
Do we have street images

267
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,830
我们正在查，但数字取证科
We're working on it, but Digital Forensics was

268
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,600
能在Fitbit上找到博兹的行踪。
able to map Boz's movement off the Fitbit.

269
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,700
最后登记的地方是斯图尔特角，
Last place it was registered was Stuart's Point,

270
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,910
在放烟花的时候打了时间戳。

271
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,910
得有人给他妻子卡拉打个电话，告诉她。
Someone needs to call Kara, his wife, let her know.

272
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,010
我已经给她打过电话了。
Yeah, I already called her.

273
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,180
你叫卡拉
You called Kara

274
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,020
是的。

你认识卡拉吗不。
Do you know Kara   No.

276
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,850

Did you actually talk to her, or did you text her

277
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,590
让我猜猜，你发了个表情。
Let me guess, you sent an emoji.

278
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,160
他们有死去丈夫的表情吗
Do they have a dead husband emoji

279
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,930
我跟她谈过了，混蛋。

280
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,660
嘿。我们得在消息泄露给媒体前通知她。
Hey. We had to notify her before it leaked to the press.

281
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,830
好吧，奥布莱恩说得对…
Okay, O'Brien's got point...

282
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,870

我和车是第一个到现场的。
Me and the rook were first on scene.

285
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,610
银行……

286
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,510
对不起，这不是规定吗
I'm sorry, isn't this protocol

287
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,050
现在你又成为团队的一员了，齐克
Now you're part of the team again, Zeke

288
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,750

来吧,齐克。
Come on, Zeke.

291
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,020
当你们这些混蛋把我当狗屎对待的时候，
When all you motherfuckers were treating me like shit,

292
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,490
朝我后背开枪，
shooting me in my fucking back,

293
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,760
博兹是我的朋友

00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,630
博兹和我的孩子玩。
Boz played with my kid.

该死，黑鬼，洗手。
Damn, nigga, wash your hands.

303
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,210
我知道你为什么想要这个。
I get why you want this.

304
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,110
博兹也是我的朋友，但你一个人做不到。
Boz was my friend, too, but you can't do this alone.

305
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,940
我需要整个部门通力合作。
I need the whole department on this, working together.

306
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,050
我不想一个人做，好吗
I'm not trying to do this alone, okay

307
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,050
博兹是我的家人。你得让我带队。

我知道你们有些人认为我是叛徒。

313
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,810
有些人认为我是告密者。
Some of you think I'm a snitch.

314
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:17,950
有些人很生气我上了你们的妈妈。
Some of you are mad I fucked your mother.

315
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,220
博兹最后一次露面

316
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,090
7月4日斯图尔特角的游行…
at the July 4th parade at Stuart's Point...

317
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,330
．..所以应该有很多监控录像，
...so there should be plenty of surveillance footage,

318
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,800
所以检查你的标签，Instagram…

319
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,660
嘿

现在我们这里有个警察死了，伙计们，他被残忍杀害了。
Now, we got a dead cop here, guys, who was brutally killed.

一个倒下的兄弟，舌头被拔掉了。
A fallen brother whose tongue was ripped out.

322
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,810
我们得把注意力集中在案子上，解决这个问题。
We need to focus on the case and solve this.

323
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,910
把录像拿给班克斯警探
So get the footage to Detective Banks

324
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,740
把你的私事放在一边。
and put your personal shit aside.

325
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,780
O ' brien,你很好

没问题，上尉。

没关系。
It's okay.

334
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,690
不管是谁干的，我一定会找到他们。
Whoever did this, I'm gonna find them.

335
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,390
我不明白……这是怎么发生的?
I don't understand... How did it happen

336
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,700
卡拉，你妈妈来电话了。

不，我姐姐在看着他。
No, my sister's watching him.

344
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:59,120
你的妹妹……朗达可以见我儿子，而我不能
Your sister... So, Rhonda gets to see my son, but I don't

345
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,150
我们真的要在这里谈吗

嘿,我是威廉。停止。
Hey, I'm William.  Stop.

348
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,690
齐克的伴侣,是的…
Zeke's partner, yup...

349
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,200
我就在外面等着。我就在外面等着。
I'll wait outside. I'll wait outside.

350
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,270
杰米在邻居家。
KARA: Jamie's at the neighbor's.

351
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:25,710
我不知道该怎么跟他说他爸爸的事。
I don't know how I'm supposed to tell him what happened to his dad.

352
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,450
我无法想象你现在的感受。
I can't imagine what you're going through right now.

353
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,820
我知道现在不是时候，
I know this is a bad time,

354
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,820
但我得问你几个问题。

355
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,460
在过去的几周里
In the last few weeks,

356
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:43,390
你注意到什么异常情况了吗
did you notice anything unusual

357
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:48,000
我是说，博兹有没有说什么，或者表现得很紧张
I mean, did Boz say anything, or act stressed out

358
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,300
他是个警察，齐克。
He was a cop, Zeke.

359
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,170
所以没什么不寻常的
So nothing out of the ordinary

360
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,140
不。
No.

361
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,410
有一样东西，一辆黑色越野车
There was one thing, there was a black SUV

362
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,710
上周的一个晚上停在外面。

363
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,080
你得到了成功
You get a make

364
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,950
路虎，凯雷德，林肯我不知道。
Range Rover, Escalade, Lincoln   I don't know.

365
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,750
我把这事告诉了博兹，他就出去了，
I told Boz about it and he went out,

366
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,790
他走了过来，我不知道，
and he walked up, and, I don't know,

367
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,160
接下来我只知道，他在里面对着一个人大喊大叫。
the next thing I know, he was yelling at somebody inside.

368
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,960
知道他们在喊什么吗

369
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,390
你听到什么了吗?

370
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:18,800
不。如果再让我看到，我就去查车牌号。
No. If I see it again, I'll get a license plate.

371
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:21,470
如果你不介意的话，能把他的设备给我吗
If you don't mind, could you get me his devices

372
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,070
我要看他的iPad，笔记本电脑。
I need to look at his iPad, laptop.

373
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,170
是的。谢谢你,卡拉。
Yeah.  Thanks, Kara.

374
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,180
不错的…我得走了，伙计们。好吧，注意安全。
Nice... I gotta go, guys. All right, be safe.

375
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,950
齐克。
Zeke.

376
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,050
他知道你是个好警察。
He knew you were a good cop.

377
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,490
你去找出是谁干的。

378
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,370
你拿枪指着你老爸
You pull a gun on your old man

379
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,600
你他妈疯了
You out of your fucking mind

380
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,200
我差点杀了你。
I could have killed you.

381
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,910
你在说什么我有枪。
What are you talking about  I got the gun.

382
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,240
我差点杀了你。
I could have killed you.

383
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,580
你怎么进来的
How'd you get in here

384
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:41,510
你忘了房东是谁了吗
Did you forget who the landlord is

385
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,980
是啊，但你无权这么做
Yeah, but that doesn't give you the right

386
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,920
想什么时候来就什么时候来。
to just walk in here anytime you want.

387
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,480
租房者有权利。

388
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,020

Heard about Boz. You all right

390
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,130
不,爸爸,我…我是混乱的。

你在说什么?没事。

394
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,510
只是，你知道的，作为警探队长，

395
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,240
很多责任。

你有意见吗
You got a problem with that

397
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,320
还是你只是害怕我会让你难堪
Or are you just scared I'm gonna embarrass you

398
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,150
看到了吗。

00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,350
这不关你的事。
This ain't about you.

400
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,920
你总是在说自己的坏话。
You always making shit about you.

401
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,990
这就是毁了你事业的东西

402
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,460
和你的婚姻。

所以，现在你在给父亲的建议

404
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,430
你在说什么，威利斯

爸爸。我们住在同一栋楼里。

406
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,070
那天我在外面看到你，

407
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:42,110
你朝我点头，好像我们是商场里唯一的两个黑人。
you nodded at me like we were the only two black guys in the mall.

408

我们已经一年多没一起吃过饭了。

412
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,550
我来告诉你。
Let me tell you something.

413
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:57,920
我父亲上班，回家。这是它。
My father went to work, came home. That was it.

414
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,320
好了，我要走了，孩子。
All right, I'm gonna get out of here, son.

415
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,660
我要去卡拉家，表达我的敬意。
I'm gonna go to Kara's, pay my respects.

416
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,960
你会没事的。
You're gonna be all right.

417
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,630
今晚你过来，我叫点吃的，我们再讨论一下这个案子。
Come over tonight, I'll order some food, we'll go over the case.

418
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,080
就因为你爸是他妈的马库斯·班克斯警长
Just because your dad was Chief fucking Marcus Banks...

419
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,120
别再提我父亲的事了。十二年前,
Stop making this about my father. Twelve years ago,

420
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,350
我告发了一个坏警察。
I turned in a dirty cop.

421
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,720
皮特·皮特
Pete  Pete

422
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,120
发生了什么事
What happened  What happened

423
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,590
他用枪指着我。
He pulled a gun on me.

424
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,590
目击者拿枪指着你
The witness pulled a gun on you

425
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:40,560
因为局里没有一个我能信任的人
Because there's nobody on the force I can fucking trust

426
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,090
我盯着这玩意看了五个小时。
I've been staring at this shit for five hours.

427
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,020
我看黄片的时间都没那么长。
I don't even look at porn that long.

428
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,070
好吧,我出去了。接下来是什么
Okay, I'm out. What's next

429
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,240
不如你去查查数字取证科
Well, why don't you check with Digital Forensics

430
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:22,040
看看博兹的通话记录里有没有一辆黑色越野车
and see if anybody in Boz's phone log has a black SUV

431
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,640
我手机没电了，你有充电器
My phone is dead, you got a charger

432
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,340
你手机没电了，你是什么，小女孩吗
Your phone's dead, what are you, a little girl

433
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,740
把你的手机借给我，闭嘴。
Let me borrow your phone, shut up.

434
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,010
好吧。
Okay.

435
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,510
谢谢你！
Thank you.

436
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,150
不要在看《暮光之城》时耗尽我的电池。
Don't drain my battery watching Twilight.

437
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,720
很高兴你加入我们。
Glad to see you joined us.

438
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,030
你认为这和约翰·克莱默有关
You think this is linked to John Kramer

439
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:45,500
我给联调局发了些照片，看看会发生什么。
I sent some pictures to the Feds, we'll see what happens.

440
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:47,630
我们的监控怎么样了
How are we doing on surveillance

441
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,530
拜托告诉我花在摄像头上的两千万给我们带来了什么
Please tell me the $20 million the city spent on cameras got us something

442
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:51,570
特鲁里街
Drury

443
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:56,670
是的…从这里到这里的街道摄像头
Yeah...Street cameras from here to here

444
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,480
已经通过了。
have already been scrubbed through.

445
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,640
面部识别没有任何结果。
Facial recognition came up with nothing.

446
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,550
这个角落里有两个摄像头坏了。
There were two cameras broken on this corner.

447
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,650
费奇和克劳斯现在就在那里。
Fitch and Kraus are there now to canvas it.

448
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,800
不。关闭。关闭。
No. Closed. Closed.

449
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,200
博兹。
There's Boz.

450
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,110
他在追谁
Who's that he's chasing

451
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,780
我认识那个人。
I know that guy.

452
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:08,880
本尼赖特兄弟。他是一个骗子。
Benny Wrights. He's a hustler.

453
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,580
严重的玩意儿。

454
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:13,320
在12街的一家被烧毁的面包工厂里。

455
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:16,220
对付一个叫皮皮兹的毒贩。
Deals with a pusher, street name Speez.

456
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,760
我们应该告诉齐克去他的。
Should we tell Zeke   Fuck him.

457
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:21,290
我负责这栋楼，你去找斯皮兹。
I'll take the building, you track down Speez.

458
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,760
老大，让我看看那边的枪。
Hey, boss, let me see that gun over there.

459
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,330
左边的那个。对，对，来吧，来吧。
The one on the left. Yeah, yeah, come on, come on.

460
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:36,710
我代表市警局，
On behalf of the Metro Police,

461
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,540
我要感谢你的慷慨。
I want to thank you for your generosity.

462
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,350
我还有事要做。我出去了。
I got shit to do. I'm out.

463
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,690
他的协议是什么
What's his deal

464
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,520
他是个不老实的混蛋。
He's a crooked piece of shit.

465
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,830
今晚就到此为止吧。你确定
Let's just call it a night.   You sure

466
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,430
是的。回家了。
Yeah. Go home.

467
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,330
去看你老婆，去看你孩子。

468
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,400
你儿子叫什么名字

469
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,900
查理。查理。

00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:02,370
好吧，我把它放下，然后马上回来。
All right, I'll put him down and come right back.

不，不，不，我不会待在这里的。
No, no, no, I'm not going to be here.

醒来,本尼。

00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,870
起床啦，伙计。

482
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:18,510
本尼,来吧。起床了。

483
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:22,350
快点，班尼，起来。

你一切都好吧

485
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,390

00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,380
我想玩个游戏。
I want to play a game.

492
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,720
嘿,齐克。威廉。
Hey, Zeke.  William.

493
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,490
你起来干什么
What are you doing up

494
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,760
我让你今晚休息的。
I told you to take the rest of the night off.

495
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,700
没事，查理在睡觉。
Uh, it's fine, Charlie's sleeping.

496
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,770
正在睡觉。

497
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,940
就在等艾玛回家，她要来个女生之夜。
Just waiting for Emma to get home, she's having a girl's night.

498
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:27,070
女孩晚上出去玩。好吧。
Girl's night out. Okay.

499
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,670
你最好小心点
You better be careful with that,

500
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,440
可能会是鸡巴之夜。
might be a dick night out.

501
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:32,480
就因为你要离婚
Just because you're getting a divorce,

502
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,380
这并不意味着其他人的婚姻也要结束。
it doesn't mean that everyone else's marriages have to end, too.

503
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,650
听起来你很忙啊。
Sounds like you got your hands full.

504
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,750
你想给我回电话吗
You want to call me back

505
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,580
不,这是好的,
Nah, it's okay,

506
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,090
我们sleeptraining。真是他妈的噩梦。
we're sleeptraining. It's a fucking nightmare.

507
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,160
看,男人,嗯…我知道你和博兹关系很好，
Look, man, um... I know you and Boz were close,

508
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,960
我不知道该怎么跟你说。
I don't know how to tell you this.

509
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:48,690
你有话要说，威廉，说吧。
You got something to say, William, say it.

510
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:51,060
我按你的要求查了所有的警局记录，
Well, I'm looking through all the Metro records like you asked,

511
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,930
博兹被指控在证人席上撒谎
and Boz was accused of lying on the stand more than anybody...

512
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,430
比他妈大得多。
by like a wide fucking margin.

513
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,540
耶稣。
Jesus.

514
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,810
法院……
The courthouse...

515
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,040
这就是为什么舌头会出现在法院。
That's why the tongue was at the courthouse.

516
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,180
我能帮你吗?
Can I help you

517
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,720
你是马库斯·班克斯吗?
Are you Marcus Banks

518
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,850
不，我是他儿子。嗯,Terroni交付。
No, I'm his son.  Well, Terroni delivery.

519
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:16,050
哦,好的。
Oh, okay.

520
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:23,160
爸爸
Dad

521
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,020
爸爸，给你吃的。
Pop, got your food.

522
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,770
草泥马
Motherfucker

523
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:12,080
你他妈怎么能不先打给我
How the fuck could you not call me first

524
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,810
我试过了，但你没接。
I tried, but you didn't answer.

525
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,680
那你他妈干嘛不等我回你电话
Well, why didn't you wait for me to fucking call you back

526
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,720
因为你会劝我放弃的
'Cause you would have talked me out of it.

527
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:19,980
我说了实话。
I told the truth.

528
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,750
给我滚远点，齐克。
Get the fuck out of my face, Zeke.

529
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:23,150
我们能进入房间吗
Can we get the room

530
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,230
该死的。
God damn it.

531
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,660
我就知道我不该让他当警察。
I knew I should have never let him become a cop.

532
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:38,240
这事很快就会失控的。
This shit's gonna go sideways fast.

533
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,570
他告发了一个坏警察。皮特是个卑鄙小人。
He turned in a dirty cop. Pete was a scumbag.

534
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,910
媒体将把他报导为英雄。
Press will make him out to be a hero.

535
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,570
那其他警察呢
And what about the other cops

536
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:44,980
你觉得他们也会称他为英雄吗
You think they're gonna call him a hero, too

537
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,880
他做了正确的事。
He did the right thing.

538
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:50,250
你知道我要做多少内部损害控制
You know how much internal damage control I have to do

539
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,120
我们会处理它。
We'll handle it.

540
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:54,720
我们一直都是，哈
We always do, huh

541
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:57,650
首席银行，这里是WF行动新闻。

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,270
抱歉，但我觉得你的脸

544
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,940
侵入我的财产。

545
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:14,270
有什么我可以帮你的吗
Is there something I can help you with

546
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:16,270
不。
No.

547
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,510
好吧。去你妈的。
All right. Fuck you very much.

548
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,240
齐克·班克斯警探。

551
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,080
快递员送来了。

552
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,220
我们把他关起来问话。

553
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,070
你好,侦探银行。
Hello, Detective Banks.

554
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,170
有人提出拯救，但被拒绝了。
Salvation was offered, but it was declined.

555
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:23,210
这混蛋以为自己是竖锯。

556

这次甚至得到了一个娃娃。

557
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:27,680
我对警局有意见，
I have a bone to pick with the police department,

558
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,810
如果你要指责别人…
and if you're going to point fingers...

559
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,610
12日街大桥。我知道那个地方。
12th Street Bridge. I know that place.

560
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:33,850
．..你们应该先把枪对准自己。
...you should start by pointing them at yourselves.

561
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,390
天啊，还有两个街区呢。
Geez, that's two blocks away.

562
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:38,690
在你坦白之前，会有更多的人死去。
Until you come clean, many more will die.

563
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,740
待回来。
Stay back.

564
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,080
保持锋利。
Stay sharp.

565
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,160
等等，伙计们。
Whoa, hold it there, guys.

566
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,750
真是个变态，伙计。
What a sick fuck, man.

567
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,290
什么他妈的
What the fuck

568
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,690
哦,不……
Oh, no...

569
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,800
全能的上帝。

570
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,040
982.

573
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,310
请求备份。

574
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,710
我在德克尔街。请求的备份
I'm on Decker Street. Request backup

575
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,010

你会没事的，坚持住。
You're going to be okay, stay with me.

579
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,070
你很好，你会没事的。

你会没事的。

581
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,440
齐克先生拜托，拜托

00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,140
让我们做我们的工作，来吧。

来吧，让我们做好本职工作，走吧。我们走吧。
Come on, let us do our jobs, let's go. Let's go.

584
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:45,180
你们都他妈去哪了
Where the fuck were all of you, huh

585
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:48,790
我儿子八分钟内叫了三次支援
My son called for backup three times in eight minutes

586
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,720
你们这些混蛋谁也不能来
and none of you motherfuckers could get here

587
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,760
任何人任何事
Nobody  Nothing

588
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:56,260
蟋蟀。好吧，这就是我要做的。
Crickets. All right, this is what I'm going to do.

589
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,260
我要打电话给调度中心
I'm going to call Dispatch

590
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,870
找出离我们最近的人，
and find out who was closest available,

591
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,270
等我找到了，我就拿走这把枪
and when I do, I'm going to take this gun

592
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,000
然后杀了那个混蛋。
and shoot that motherfucker.

593
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,410
我们清楚
We clear

594
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,440
费奇，是你
Fitch, it was you

595
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,040
你又在耍我儿子
You fucking with my son again

596
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,910
去你的，狗娘养的
God damn you, son of a bitch

597
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,250
我下车
Get off me

598
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,480
你完蛋了，混蛋，听到了吗
You're done, motherfucker, you hear me

599
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,150
你他妈的做的
You're fucking done

600
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,820
别让我再看到你。
Don't let me see your face again.

601
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,920
好吧,叫克劳斯,
All right，call Kraus,

602
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,030
找出费奇最后的位置。
find out Fitch's last location.

603
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,210
你好,侦探惠誉。
Hello, Detective Fitch.

604
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,910
我想玩个游戏。
I want to play a game.

605
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:48,110
正义的浪潮在你身边高涨。
The tide of justice is rising around you.

606
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:50,850
90秒后，水会上升
In 90 seconds, the water will rise

607
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,980
到铜线的高度，
to the height of the copper wires,

608
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,220
如果你还在水箱里，
and if you are still in the tank,

609
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,120
你会被电死的。
you will be electrocuted.

610
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:00,260
除非你做出牺牲来净化自己。
Unless you make the sacrifice that will cleanse you.

611
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:02,060
惠誉:神…哦,上帝…
FITCH: God... Oh, God...

612
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:04,900
你杀了一个人因为他侮辱了你。
You murdered a man because he insulted you.

613
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:06,330
把你的手
Put your hands

614
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,170
在我能看到的地方，混蛋。
where I can see them, motherfucker.

615
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,070
我说了把手放在我能看到的地方，先生。
I said put your hands where I can see them, sir.

616
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,370
你的手指扣动了扳机
Your finger pulled the trigger

617
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:19,510
这种情况不能再发生了。
and that cannot happen again.

618
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:23,350
生存很简单，但需要付出牺牲。
Survival is simple, but it comes with a sacrifice.

619
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:26,520
用嘴咬住这个装置，
Bite down on the device in your mouth,

620
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:28,120
哪一个能启动马达
which will start the motor

621
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:29,990
它会把你的手指撕裂…
that will rip your fingers away...

622
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,460
．..让你自由
...leaving you free

623
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:33,320
带着你的生命逃离。
to escape with your life.

624
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,230
但如果你不赶快行动，
But if you don't act quickly,

625
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:38,330
等着你的只有这个水坑。
all that awaits you is this watery tomb.

626
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,530
生或死，你自己选择。
Live or die, make your choice.

627
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:25,240
克劳斯，找到手指的那座桥有什么特别之处吗
Hey, Kraus, anything special about the bridge where we found the fingers

628
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:27,040
是啊，为什么是那座桥
Yeah, why that bridge

629
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:30,510
他就是在那里枪杀了吉米·林肯。
It was where he shot that kid, Jimmy Lincoln.

630
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:33,240
那你们是怎么发现这个地方的
Then how did you guys find out about this place

631
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,580
这个叫本尼·赖特的人
This guy, Benny Wrights,

632
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:37,050
博兹最后一次出现是在7月4日。
who Boz was last seen with on July 4th.

633
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,280
你怎么知道博兹最后和谁在一起
How do you know who Boz was last seen with

634
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,750
我们从斯图尔特角的一家当铺上取下来的。
We took it off a pawn shop feed in Stuart Point.

635
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:43,190
你却没告诉我。
And you didn't tell me.

636
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:46,690
这是谁干的
Who the fuck did this

637
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,130
一个对市警局有意见的人。
Somebody who has it out for the Metro PD.

638
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:53,200
或许只是为了费奇。
Or maybe just for Fitch.

639
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:55,100
你想说什么，德鲁里
You trying to say something, Drury

640
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:56,400
你知道我在说什么。
You know what I'm saying.

641
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:58,340
我怀疑你会为费奇流泪。
I doubt you'll be shedding tears for Fitch.

642
00:44:58,370 --> 00:44:59,740
好了，来吧。来吧,齐克。
All right, come on. Come on, Zeke.

643
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:01,270
他妈的混蛋。

644
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:02,510
好吧,忽略他。
Okay, ignore him.

645
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,640
你有什么发现吗?
Did you get anything

646
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:11,150
有一个名字。本尼赖特兄弟。最后一个和博兹在一起的人。
Got a name. Benny Wrights. Last guy Boz was seen with.

Okay, find him, and you got hours, not days.

648
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:18,320
本尼就是在这里买冰毒的。
And this is where Benny gets his meth.

649
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:20,690
你知道那是什么
You know what that is

650
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:24,290
这是测验吗?
Is this a test

651
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:26,760
只是问你个问题。呃，是个毒品窝点。
Just asking you a question.  Uh, it's a meth house.

652
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,700
你把钱放桶里，冰毒就来了。
You put the money in the bucket, the meth comes down.

653
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:32,040
有人看了《火线》
Oh, somebody watched The Wire.

654
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:35,340
这是新杰克城的鬼话。该死的。

656
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,220
你在说什么

661
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:58,830

Out of my way, out of my way  Police

687
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,490
男:o

哇,哇,哇
Whoa, whoa, whoa

692
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:06,200
狗屎带着你的狗

693
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:08,430
去你的，伙计。带上你的狗

695
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:14,370
耶稣基督。

696
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,870
神圣的他妈的狗屎。
Holy fucking shit.

697
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:22,710
这他妈的是怎么回事
What the fuck's going on

698
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:23,650
回到里面。回到里面。
Back inside. Get back inside.

699
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,450
隐藏你的狗屎

700
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:36,590
来吧
Come on

00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:38,430
他妈的。操
Fuck. Fuck

702
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,610
我他妈的腿
My fucking leg

703
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,510
你为什么要把事情搞得这么复杂
Why do you make this shit so hard

704
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,280
如果我真的想搞砸呢
What if I really wanted to get fucked up

705
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:55,750
草泥马…
Motherfucker...

706
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:58,250
你得让顾客轻松点，讨厌鬼
You got to make it easy for the customer, skeeve

707
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,790
我他妈的腿
My fucking leg

708
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:04,490
这条腿糟透了。
That leg is fucked up.

709
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,660
哟，哟，哟，哟
Yo, yo, yo, yo

710
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:06,720
让我给奶奶拍张照片。
Let me get a shot for the Gram.

711
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,530
稍等一下。
Hold on for one second.

712
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,560
毒贩:这他妈是…等一下，等一下。
DRUG DEALER: What the fuck... Hold on, hold on.

713
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:11,500
我的男人。
My man.

714
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:14,260
好了，你想让我标记你
Here we go  You want me to tag you

715
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,670
他妈的……去你妈的。
Fuck... Fuck you.

716
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,370
我能标记你吗，狗娘养的操你…
Can I tag you, motherfucker   Fuck you...

717
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:20,440
你以前见过这个人
You see this man before

718
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:22,540
我什么都不会告诉你
I ain't telling you shit

719
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:24,840
为什么，因为你担心那块骨头会伸出你的腿吗
Why, 'cause you're worried about that bone sticking out your leg

720
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,680
你为什么不让我给它消毒
Why don't you let me sterilize it

721
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:30,920
不…不…没有操
No... No... No  Fuck

722
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:37,650
我是班尼，请停下
It's Benny  Stop, please

723
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:39,390
大家都认识那个该死的班尼·莱特
Everybody knows that motherfucker Benny Wrights

724
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,860
他是我最好的顾客之一。
He's one of my best customers, man.

725
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,330
你最后一次见他是什么时候
When was the last time you saw him

726
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,760
我已经两天没见过那婊子了。
I ain't seen the bitch in two days, man.

727
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,700
坊间传言那混蛋吸毒过量。
Word on the street is that motherfucker OD'd.

728
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,300
他妈的这金色飞贼。
Fuck this snitch.

729
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,770
操
Fuck

730
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:01,240
那是浪费时间。
Well, that was a waste of time.

731
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,820
我们知道本尼死了。
Well, we know Benny's dead.

732
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:06,420
冰毒不是那种需要休息的东西。
Meth isn't the type of thing you take a break from.

733
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:10,020
而且，你也看到那个装置了
Besides, you see that device

734
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:13,390
那不是蛀牙的人设计的。
That was not designed by anybody with rotten teeth.

735
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,490
你觉得这个竖锯角怎么样
What do you think about this whole Jigsaw angle

736
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:17,800
你认为那是，你怎么称呼的，那些门徒中的一个
You think it's a, whatdoyoucallthem, one of those disciples

737
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:20,560
约翰·克莱默的目标不是警察。
John Kramer didn't target cops.

738
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,830
不管是谁干的，都有另一个动机。
Whoever did this has another motive.

739
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:24,370
个人的东西。
Something personal.

740
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,940
他们不服从命令
And they're not following orders,

741
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:28,310
尤其是鬼魂的命令。
especially the orders of a ghost.

742
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,740
鬼,
Ghost or not,

743
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:33,680
有人在幕后操纵一切。
somebody's out there pulling all the strings.

744
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:35,450
你认为是这个人寄给你的
You think this guy sent you the boxes

745
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,950
因为你是负责这个案子的警探，
because you're the lead detective on the case,

746
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:38,480
或者因为你就是你
or because you're you

747
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,850
我不知道。
I don't know.

748
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,020
你有任何不是警察的敌人
Well, you got any enemies  That aren't cops

749
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:47,590
我不知道她为什么不再给我一次机会。
I don't know why she won't give me another chance.

750
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:50,290
我不知道，也许是因为你打了她
I don't know, maybe it's because you beat her

751
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:51,630
当你喝太多的时候。
when you drink too much.

752
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,300
你有没有想过
You ever think of that

753
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:56,770
这是一种严厉的爱。这家伙到底是谁
That's some tough love. Who the hell is this guy

754
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,970
Excop。搭档告发了他
Excop. Partner snitched on him,

755
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,410
被关了九年牢。
had to do nine years hard time.

756
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,810
体制把他赶走了，现在他在这里。
The system spit him out, now here he is.

757
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:11,720
嗨,皮特。
Hey, Pete.

758
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:18,660
齐克。
Zeke.

759
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:23,060
我没想到会在这见到他。
Last guy I expected to see here.

760
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:24,560
你想戒酒
You trying to get sober

761
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:26,630
酒精不是我的问题
Alcohol's not my problem.

762
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:28,630
玻璃和瓶子都能杀人。
The glass and the bottle can kill.

763
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,570
你好吗，皮特
How you doing, Pete

764
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,600
十八个月没喝酒，住在教堂地下室，
Eighteen months sober, living in a church basement,

765
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:34,840
谁还能要求别的呢
who could ask for anything more

766
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:38,780
这是谁
Who's this

767
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:40,710
侦探Schenk。我们在一起办案。
Detective Schenk. We're working a case together.

768
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:42,010
彼得:一起工作
PETE: Working together

769
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:43,580
别让他抓到你乱穿马路，
Don't let this guy catch you jaywalking,

770
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:45,080
否则他会在你背后捅一刀。
or he'll stab you right in the fucking back.

771
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:48,120
别忘了，皮特，你给了我那把刀。
Don't forget, Pete, you gave me the knife.

772
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:50,390
你说得对，是我干的。
You're right, I did.

773
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:51,790
你也看到了这个警察
And you witnessed this cop

774
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:53,560
把受害者从屋顶扔下去
throw the victim off a rooftop

775
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:55,930
你亲眼所见，我是说，亲眼所见
And you saw it, I mean, with your own eyes

776
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:58,030
你可以确定这个警察的身份
And you can positively ID this cop

777
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,500
他已经把脚踩在这个社区的脖子上太久了。
He's had his foot on the neck of this community for way too long.

778
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:03,430
我们不能这样。
We can't have this.

779
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:06,700
我会作证的，邓利维警官。我将这样做。
I'll testify, Officer Dunleavy. I'll do it.

780
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:16,450
皮特皮特发生了什么发生了什么

他用枪指着我。

782
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:23,650
目击者拿枪指着你

783
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:27,520
我疯了很久，但现在我承担了责任。
I was mad for a long time, but now I take responsibility.

784
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,460
我就不该扣动扳机。
I should have never pulled the trigger.

785
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:32,900
那家伙有家庭。
The guy had a family.

786
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:35,630
那时候很疯狂，对吧
It was crazy back then, right

787
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:37,470
我们是在第8条下工作的。
We were working under Article 8.

788
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:41,540
我们失去了控制。
We were out of control.

789
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:44,470
警察被赋予了打击犯罪的自由裁量权。
Cops were given their own discretion to crack down on crime.

790
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:47,510
7月4日晚上9:30你在哪里。
Where were you July 4th at 9:30 p.m.

791
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:51,480
真的这就是你来这里的原因
Really  That's what you're here for

792
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:53,720
这就是我在这里的原因。
That's what I'm here for.

793
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:57,090
听着，有个人喝醉了去开会
Look, some guy came to a meeting drunk

794
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,720
想和赞助商打一架，所以我打了他。
and wanted to fight a sponsor, so I hit him.

795
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,830
把他打晕了。
Knocked him clean out.

796
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,860
不管怎样，警察来了。我还在缓刑期
Anyway, the cops came. I'm still on probation,

797
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,000
但幸运的是，是奥布莱恩。
but lucky for me, it was O'Brien.

798
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:08,770
他让整个事情顺其自然，因为，你知道…
He let the whole thing slide because, you know...

799
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,570
忠诚。
loyalty.

800
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:14,640
忠诚。
Loyalty.

801
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:16,810
照顾,皮特。
Take care, Pete.

802
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:19,810
上帝爱你，齐克。
God loves you, Zeke.

803
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,150
比你更多。
More than you.

804
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:31,490
真不敢相信那家伙以前是个警察。
Can't believe that guy used to be a cop.

805
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,490
他枪杀了一个无辜的人，但你背叛了他
He shot an innocent guy, but you turned on him

806
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,530
有个规矩，你最好学会怎么遵守，
There's a code, and you better learn how to follow it,

807
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,000
否则你这辈子就得小心翼翼了。
or you're going to spend the rest of your life watching your back.

808
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:42,000
公平点。
Fair point.

809
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:43,600
也许他们让我们成为搭档是件好事。
Maybe it's a good thing they made us partners.

810
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:49,710
留个口信。
Leave a message.

811
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:51,210
是的，爸爸，我在你的公寓。
Yeah, Dad, I'm at your apartment.

812
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,680
我昨晚在这里。
I was here last night.

813
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:54,640
你看起来不像是回家过。
It doesn't look like you've been home.

814
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:00,890
好吧，给我打电话。
All right, give me a call.

815
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:17,200
你已经接通了威廉
You've gotten through to William,

816
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:19,040
请在哔声后留言。

817
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,810

818
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:23,240
你他妈的在哪儿给我打电话。
where the fuck are you  Give me a call.

819
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:24,880
珍妮:告诉我发生了什么，好吗
JEANNIE: Just tell me what happened, okay

820
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,950
嘿,嘿嘿
Hey  Hey  Hey

821
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:29,250
把盒子放在地上
Put the box on the ground

822
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,650
在地上举起手来举起手来
On the ground  Hands up  Hands up

823
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,150
趴在地上举起手来，举起手来
On the ground now  Hands up, hands up

824
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:36,220
不要动
Don't move

825
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:40,220
带他离开这里。
Get him out of here.

826
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:42,490
带他去拘留室。
Take him to holding.

827
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:46,500
抱歉，班克斯，他从我身边飞过。
I'm sorry, Banks, he blew right past me.

828
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,040
不可能，齐克，那个不一样。
No way, Zeke, that one is not the same.

829
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:53,600
我要打电话给拆弹小组。
I'm calling the bomb squad.

830
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,640
安琪，你是部门主管。
Angie, you're the head of the department.

831
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:57,140
两名警察死了，没时间了。
We got two dead cops, there's no time.

832
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:00,680
让所有人。
Get everybody out.

833
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:02,610
所有人出去，所有人出去
Everybody out  Everybody out

834
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:04,650
每一个人,去
Everybody, go

835
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,810
那是他妈的皮肤啊。
Is that fucking skin   Ugh.

836
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,980
"我惹到你了吗，班克斯警探
"Am I getting under your skin, Detective Banks

837
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:35,650
"小心点，当你在寻找更多的尸体时，
"Careful, while you're looking for more bodies to drop,

838
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:38,620
“我要取下你的头。”
"I'll take your head."

839
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,250
“我要你的头……”
"I'll take your head..."

840
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,850
“我是不是惹怒你了……
"Am I getting under your skin...

841
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:45,160
“我是不是惹怒你了……
"Am I getting under your skin...

842
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:47,830
“我是不是惹怒你了……”
"Am I getting under your skin..."

843
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,070
…的家庭。这是我妻子艾玛
...family. This is my wife, Emma,

844
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,270
这是我儿子，查理。
this is my son, Charlie.

845
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:04,710
那是什么鬼东西
What the fuck is that

846
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:08,280
上尉，这下面有东西。
Captain, there's something under here.

847
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,260
康斯坦丁油漆。
Constantine Paints.

848
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,310
谢谢,是的。
Thanks, yeah.

849
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:41,350
跟我来。
Follow me.

850
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:51,090
奥布莱恩:你怎么知道这个地方
O'BRIEN: How do you know about this place

851
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:53,420
齐克，你怎么知道这个地方的
Zeke, how do you know about this place

852
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:56,230
我爸爸以前常带我来这里。
My dad used to take me here.

853
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:57,860
注意脚下，先生们。
Watch your step, gentlemen.

854
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,130
它并不总是肉店。
It wasn't always a butcher shop.

855
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:03,070
曾经是康斯坦丁火车。
Used to be Constantine Trains.

856
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,040
就像爱好商店。
Like a hobby shop.

857
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:22,290
哦，天啊。
O'BRIEN: Oh, my God.

858
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:45,010
任何东西
Anything

859
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,810
我们正在分析录音。
FORENSICS: Well, we're analyzing the tape recording.

860
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,780
你好,侦探Schenk,
Hello, Detective Schenk,

861
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:50,450
我想玩个游戏。
I want to play a game.

862
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:54,390
你是警察学院的班长。
You were head of your class at the Police Academy.

863
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:56,220
他显然被剥皮了。
He was obviously skinned...

864
00:56:57,490 --> 00:56:59,360
后期。
postmortem.

865
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:00,960
你爸爸是我当初想这么做的原因。
Your dad's the reason I wanted to do this in the first place.

866
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:02,230
．..身体得分第一
...the body was scored first

867
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:04,860
要把它们切成更大的条状，
to remove the pieces in larger strips,

868
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:07,870
胳膊，脖子，他撕开皮肤的时候……
arms, neck, as he ripped the skin...

869
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,040
也许他们让我们成为搭档是件好事。
Maybe it's a good thing they made us partners.

870
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:13,340
即使是防御的伤口，
Even the defensive wounds,

871
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:14,970
他显然试图反击
he clearly tried to fight back,

872
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:16,740
这就解释了更深的伤口。
which explains the deeper gashes.

873
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:26,250
船长,在这里。
Captain, over here.

874
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,120
是针对警察的连环杀手吗
Is it a serial killer targeting cops

875
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:30,020
受害者在警察体内吗
Is the victim inside a policeman

876
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:32,290
无可奉告。哈特局长今晚会发表声明。
No comment. Commissioner Hart will make a statement tonight.

877
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:37,060
我们得尽量保持他的身份
We got to try to keep his identity

878
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:39,160
除非我告诉他妻子
out of the press until I tell his wife.

879
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:45,000
"我激怒你了吗，班克斯警探"
"Am I getting under your skin, Detective Banks "

880
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:10,430
嘿,O ' brien。
Hey, O'Brien.

881
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:11,500
是的,老板
Yeah, boss

882
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:12,530
你见过齐克
You seen Zeke

883
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:15,330
不，暂时不会。
No, not for a while.

884
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:16,900
好吧，我要去调查悬案。
Okay, I'm heading down to Cold Case.

885
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:18,370
复制,队长。
Copy that, Captain.

886
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:23,240
我需要所有可用单位
I need all available units,

887
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:25,240
警官在比曼街和第三大道交口受伤。
officer down 3rd and Beaman.

888
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,440
请在毕蔓街3号报告。
Please report, 3rd and Beaman.

889
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,230
我们得到了什么
What do we got

890
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:49,070
我在写罚单，一个戴着猪面具的人，
I was writing a ticket and some guy in a pig's mask,

891
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,470
他拿着刀向我冲过来。
he runs up on me with a knife.

892
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,270
他捅了你的胳膊，然后就走了
So, he stabs your arm and just takes off

893
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:53,570
我尽我所能击退他，而他…
I fought him off the best I could and he...

894
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,270
他跑开了。
He took off running.

895
00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:58,310
他有理由攻击你吗
Is there any reason he would have to attack you

896
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:01,850
不。他只是想招惹警察。
No. He just wanted to mess with the cops.

897
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:05,850
"小心点，当你在寻找更多的尸体时，
"Careful, while you're looking for more bodies to drop,

898
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,220
“我要取下你的头。”
"I'll take your head."

899
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:09,850
安琪，你是部门主管。
Angie, you're the head of the department.

900
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:11,190
安琪……
Angie...

901
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:12,460
啊,操
Ah, fuck

902
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:14,190
安吉接
Angie  Pick up

903
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:24,270
这里是安琪·加尔扎上尉，

904
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:25,070
请在提示音后留言。谢谢。
leave a message at the tone. Thanks.

905
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:34,910
安琪，去大办公室他来找你了。
Angie, get to the bullpen  He's coming for you.

906
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:44,250
他妈的。他妈的,他妈的,他妈的。
Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

907
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:48,130
狗屎
Shit

908
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:52,030
嘿,嘿嘿
Hey  Hey  Hey

909
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:06,140
你好你好,狗屎
Hello  Hello  Shit

910
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,970
帮助
Help

911
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:14,310
你好,加萨船长。
Hello, Captain Garza.

912
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:16,050
我想玩个游戏。
I want to play a game.

913
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:18,480
你掩盖了你部门的腐败，
You have covered up corruption in your department,

914
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:21,250
从不为无辜的人冒险。
never sticking your neck out for the innocent.

915
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:23,590
掩盖真相的责任在你。
Now, the coverup will be on you.

916
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:26,320
几秒钟后，滚烫的蜡
In a few seconds, boiling hot wax

917
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,630
会从你上面的管子里出来。
will be coming out of the pipe above you.

918
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:31,730
唯一能让你不被窒息的方法
The only way to stop yourself from being suffocated

919
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,660
就是切断你的脊髓
is to sever your spinal cord

920
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:35,670
你的脖子下面有一把刀，
with the blade beneath your neck,

921
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,370
这样可以阻止蜡的流出。
which will stop the wax.

922
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,740
你不能一走了之
You cannot walk away,

923
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:40,470
但你可以活下来。
but you can survive.

924
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,410
生或死，你自己选择。
Live or die, make your choice.

925
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,540
去你妈的
Fuck you

926
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:57,490
安吉安吉
Angie  Angie

927
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,360
你他妈给我闪开
Get the fuck out of the way

928
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:17,470
(怎么没人接电话?
How come no one is answering the phone

929
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:19,340
一名警官被袭击了，这里一片混乱。
An officer was attacked, it's fucking chaos in here.

930
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:22,450
安吉安吉

931
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:27,480
安吉
Angie

932
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:29,750
齐克，怎么回事
Zeke, what's going on

933
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:30,820
他有她
He's got her

934
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:32,090
是谁让她
Who's got her

935
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:34,090
凶手抓住了安琪
The killer has Angie

936
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:35,330
我猜你没听到，凶手只是
I guess you didn't hear, the killer just

937
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:37,090
在比曼街和第三街交汇处袭击了一名警察。
attacked a cop at 3rd and Beaman.

938
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:40,430
那只是障眼法，好让我们离开警局。
That was just a diversion to get us out of the precinct.

939
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:42,300
她就在地下室里
She's down in the fucking basement

940
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,110
你找到安琪了吗
Did you find Angie

941
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:56,080
在地下室，在地下室
In the basement, in the basement

942
01:02:56,110 --> 01:02:57,710
Angie加尔萨船长,

狗屎
Shit

950
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:35,420
没事的，没事的。不会有事的。
It's okay, it's okay. It's gonna be fine.

951
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:36,490
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my God.

952
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:42,560
没关系。
It's okay.

953
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:44,560
没关系……哦……
It's okay... Oh...

954
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:44,690
锁定下来。
Lock it down.

955
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,320
你理解我
You understand me

956
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,660
封锁这里，不许任何人离开这个分局。
Lock it down, nobody gets out of this precinct.

957
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:51,400
我需要所有的监控录像
I need all the footage from the cameras

958
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:52,630
在证物室。

959
01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:54,600
好了,这……
Okay, here...

960
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:55,930
这是电话打进来的时候
Here's when the call came in,

961
01:04:55,970 --> 01:04:58,540
但在你进来之前什么都没有。
but then there's nothing until you come in.

962
01:04:58,570 --> 01:05:03,740
看这里，从13:11跳到了13:24。故障
You see right there, it jumps from 13:11 to 13:24. Glitch

963

You took a stand, Zeke, against a dirty cop,

1093
01:18:24,170 --> 01:18:25,280
它给你带来了什么

接到每个流浪汉的电话

But you, you're different.

1104
01:18:52,370 --> 01:18:55,140
你地铁最好的。
You're Metro's finest.

1105
01:18:55,170 --> 01:18:57,140
这就是我想和你合作的原因。
That's why I want to team up with you on this.

1106
01:18:57,170 --> 01:19:00,440
你去找那些坏警察，剩下的交给我。
You find the dirty cops and I'll take care of the rest.

1107
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:03,280
你想让我帮你杀警察
You want me to help you kill cops

1108
01:19:03,310 --> 01:19:04,620
不,操不。
No, fuck no.

1109
01:19:04,650 --> 01:19:06,650
只有坏的。
Just the bad ones.

1110
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:10,250
约翰·克莱默是对的，螺旋。
John Kramer was right, the spiral.

1111
01:19:10,290 --> 01:19:14,460
它是变化、进化、进步的象征。
A symbol of change, evolution, progress.

1112
01:19:14,490 --> 01:19:16,330
但为什么仅限于个人
But why limit that to an individual

1113
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:18,560
当你能把它应用到整个系统时
when you can apply it to a whole system

1114
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,830
你因为做了正确的事而被枪击。
You got shot for doing the right thing.

1115
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:22,470
但面对现实吧，这些警察
But let's face it, these cops

1116
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:23,730
他们不会自己清理的。
They're not going to clean up on their own.

1117
01:19:23,770 --> 01:19:26,200
但我们在这里，
But we take a tongue here,

1118
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:28,670
有几根骨头，他们就会过来。
a few bones there, they'll come around.

1119
01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:31,810
我们要修复一个坏掉的部门。好吧
We're going to fix a broken department. Okay

1120
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,340
你和我。
You and me.

1121
01:19:33,380 --> 01:19:34,380
好吧。
Okay.

1122
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:36,680
好吧。
Okay.

1123
01:19:37,510 --> 01:19:39,150
让我们做它。
Let's do it.

1124
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:42,150
我想相信你。我做的事。
I want to trust you. I do.

1125
01:19:42,190 --> 01:19:45,120
我在。但是我爸爸自由了。
I'm in. But my dad goes free.

1126
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:52,500
1秒。
One second.

1127
01:19:52,530 --> 01:19:54,800
911请说明你的紧急情况
911, please state your emergency.

1128
01:19:54,830 --> 01:19:56,830
你好，我在旧肥皂厂
Hello, uh, I'm at the old soap factory

1129
01:19:56,870 --> 01:19:58,270
马迪根巷。
on Madigan Lane.

1130
01:19:58,300 --> 01:19:59,640
有个持枪的疯子，
There's a crazy guy with a gun,

1131
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:01,610
他到处开枪。请快一点
he's firing it everywhere. Please hurry

1132
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,340
那他妈的是什么
What the fuck was that

1133
01:20:03,370 --> 01:20:05,240
你最好快点，齐克，特警马上就到。
You better hurry, Zeke, SWAT's on the way.

1134
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:07,680
听着，我想相信你，真的。
Look, I want to believe you, I do.

1135
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:11,350
我想相信你。
I want to trust you.

1136
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,180
拿着这个，你会需要的。
Take this, you'll need it.

1137
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:15,220
来吧。
Come on.

1138
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,520
我们去看你爸爸吧。
Let's go see your dad.

1139
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:28,170
是时候做最后的测试了。
It's time for your final test.

1140
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:41,650
爸爸。
Dad.

1141
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:42,710
以西结。
Ezekiel.

1142
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:44,280
该死把他放下来
Oh, shit  Get him down

1143
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:50,750
哦,狗屎。
Oh, shit.

1144
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:55,160
我抓住你了，爸爸。
I got you, Dad.

1145
01:20:55,190 --> 01:20:56,630
齐克。帮助我,儿子。
Zeke. Help me, son.

1146
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:01,730
别担心，别担心。
Don't worry, don't worry.

1147
01:21:01,770 --> 01:21:04,600
我不会让你死的。我要把你弄下来。
I'm not going to let you die. I will get you down.

1148
01:21:08,870 --> 01:21:10,240
没事的，坚持住。
It's all right, just hold on.

1149
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:12,240
马上杀了这个混蛋。
Shoot this motherfucker right now.

1150
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:16,610
把他弄下来快把他弄下来
Get him down  Get him down now

1151
01:21:17,850 --> 01:21:19,780
我以为我们是搭档。
I thought we were partners.

1152
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:22,220
你要开枪了，齐克
You going to shoot me, Zeke

1153
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:23,490
用你的一颗子弹
With your one bullet

1154
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:24,590
坏主意。
Bad idea.

1155
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:25,860
你爸爸会死的。
It kills your dad.

1156
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:30,260
顺便说一句，他朝我开了一枪。
He took a shot at me, by the way.

1157
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:31,930
错过了。
Missed.

1158
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:33,630
我浪费了四个。
I wasted four.

1159
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:35,430
也就是说你只剩一枪了，齐克。
That means you got one shot left, Zeke.

1160
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:41,370
好了，警察来了。我们还有4分钟。
All right, cops are here. That gives us four minutes.

1161
01:21:41,410 --> 01:21:43,810
你知道人体内有1。5加仑的血吗，齐克
Do you know there's 1.5 gallons of blood in the human body, Zeke

1162
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:50,450
以你老爸失血过多的速度，
At the rate your old man is bleeding out,

1163
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:53,380
再过三分钟，罐子就满了
in just three minutes, those jars will be full

1164
01:21:53,420 --> 01:21:56,290
你爸爸会死的。
and your dad will be dead.

1165
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:57,720
唯一能让他自由的东西
The only thing that can set him free

1166
01:21:57,750 --> 01:22:01,730
你枪里的子弹是对着那个目标开的吗。
is the bullet in your gun fired at that target.

1167
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,930
不管怎样，我有个万无一失的办法离开这里。
Either way, I've got a foolproof way out of here.

1168
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:06,760
你不是拼图。
You're not Jigsaw.

1169
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:08,570
这是游戏。
That's the game.

1170
01:22:09,730 --> 01:22:12,470
杀了我，你们俩都会输。
Shoot me and you both lose.

1171
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:15,270
射中目标，我们都赢。
Shoot the target and we both win.

1172
01:22:15,310 --> 01:22:16,570
你想玩吗
You want to play

1173
01:22:16,610 --> 01:22:20,240
我要死了，齐克，结束这一切吧。
I'm dying, Zeke, end it now.

1174
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:21,780
在这个走廊。
In this corridor.

1175
01:22:21,810 --> 01:22:23,710
罗杰。西南入口。
Roger that. Southwest entrance.

1176
01:22:25,050 --> 01:22:26,420
从南门进去。
Going through the south door.

1177
01:22:28,620 --> 01:22:30,420
没有在这里。继续前进。
Nothing here. Keep moving.

1178
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:31,920
我需要你们所有人。
I need you all in.

1179
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:33,560
邓利维毁了我们俩的生活
Dunleavy ruined both our lives

1180
01:22:33,590 --> 01:22:35,390
你还想帮那个混蛋
and you tried to help that piece of shit

1181
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:37,660
齐克皮特
Zeke   Pete

1182
01:22:37,690 --> 01:22:39,560
你考试没及格。
You failed that test.

1183
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,670
现在我需要你选择和谁在一起。
Now I need you to choose who you're really with.

1184
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:43,600
那个败坏了警队的人
The man who corrupted the force,

1185
01:22:43,630 --> 01:22:45,640
或者那个想要拯救它的人。
or the one who's trying to save it.

1186
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:46,740
你想告诉他吗，队长
You want to tell him, Chief

1187
01:22:49,370 --> 01:22:51,040
告诉我
Tell me what

1188
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:53,850
告诉他你根据第8条做了什么。
Tell him about all the fucking shit you did under Article 8.

1189
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:56,450
他在说什么
What's he talking about

1190
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,020
时间不多了。他在说什么
Time's running out.  What's he talking about

1191
01:22:58,050 --> 01:23:01,350
公民死亡。
Citizens were dying.

1192
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:05,020
我们做了必须做的来清理街道。
We did what we had to to clean up the streets.

1193
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:06,890
皮特:那时候很疯狂，对吧
PETE: It was crazy back then, right

1194
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:08,930
我们是根据第8条工作的，
We were working under Article 8,

1195
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,330
我们失去了控制。
we were out of control.

1196
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,400
谋杀率下降了。
Murder rate went way down.

1197
01:23:14,430 --> 01:23:16,500
这是他妈的扯淡。
That's fucking bullshit.

1198
01:23:16,530 --> 01:23:18,300
人们又感到安全了。
People felt safe again.

1199
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:20,770
警察越来越脏，街道也越来越干净。
The streets got cleaner because the cops got dirtier.

1200
01:23:20,810 --> 01:23:22,640
顺便说一句，你爸监督了整件事。
Your dad oversaw the whole thing, by the way.

1201
01:23:22,670 --> 01:23:25,580
无辜的人被枪杀，都是为了伸张正义。
Innocent people getting shot, all in the name of justice.

1202
01:23:25,610 --> 01:23:26,910
第8条是最腐败的一条
Article 8 was one of the most corrupt

1203
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:28,810
历史上的警察政策，
police policies in history,

1204
01:23:28,850 --> 01:23:30,550
猜猜谁是你爸爸的得力助手
and guess who was your dad's righthand man

1205
01:23:30,580 --> 01:23:32,450
抱歉，或者我应该说女人，一直都是
Sorry, or should I say woman, the whole time

1206
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:35,520
我们会处理它。我们一直都是，哈
We'll handle it. We always do, huh

1207
01:23:35,550 --> 01:23:36,590
安吉
Angie

1208
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:37,720
安吉
Angie

1209
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:39,360
这是安琪。
It was Angie.

1210
01:23:39,390 --> 01:23:40,620
我的意思是，这不是一个巨大的惊喜。
I mean, not a massive surprise.

1211
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:42,530
你觉得是因为她的好名声
You think it was her stellar reputation

1212
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,460
让她在35岁时就有了辖区拜托。
that got her a precinct at age 35  Come on.

1213
01:23:44,490 --> 01:23:47,500
杀了这混蛋，以西结。现在。
Shoot this piece of shit, Ezekiel. Now.

1214
01:23:47,530 --> 01:23:49,100
没错，因为那是警察的职责。
Yeah, that's right, because that's what cops do.

1215
01:23:49,130 --> 01:23:50,500
先开枪，再问问题。
Shoot first, ask questions later.

1216
01:23:53,870 --> 01:23:57,070
你看着我父亲死去而我想救你。
You watched my father die and I'm trying to save yours.

1217
01:23:57,110 --> 01:23:58,940
如果我们要信任彼此，
If we're going to trust each other,

1218
01:23:58,980 --> 01:23:59,980
我需要你这么做。
I need you to do this.

1219
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:02,910
以西结…
Ezekiel...

1220
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:06,950
你一直做的是对的，现在就做吧。
You've always done the right thing, do it now.

1221
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:08,750
这混蛋在杀警察。
This piece of shit is killing cops.

1222
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:12,390
你仍然需要做出决定
You still need to decide,

1223
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:15,890
你可以开枪打我，或者…
you can shoot me, or...

1224
01:24:15,930 --> 01:24:16,990
或者你可以救你爸爸。
Or you can save your dad.

1225
01:24:18,860 --> 01:24:20,560
时钟的滴答声,男人。
Clock's ticking, man.

1226
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:21,730
觉得快。
Think fast.

1227
01:24:22,630 --> 01:24:24,140
骑兵的到来。
Cavalry's coming.

1228
01:24:24,170 --> 01:24:26,500
但没来得及帮你老爸的忙。
But not in time to do any favors for your old man.

1229
01:24:26,540 --> 01:24:27,700
只有你能做到。
Only you can do that.

1230
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:37,350
爸爸的爸爸
Dad  Dad

1231
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:39,550
开火
Shots fired

1232
01:24:49,190 --> 01:24:50,660
齐克……齐克。
Zeke... Zeke.

1233
01:24:51,830 --> 01:24:52,860
会没事的。
It's going to be okay.

1234
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:56,070
他走了。
He's getting away.

1235
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:58,140
别让他跑了。
Don't let him get away.

1236
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,910
去……去
Go... Go

1237
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:21,030
停止。不要进来。
Stop. Don't come in.

1238
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:22,090
不要进来。
Don't come in.

1239
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,040
哦,上帝。
Oh, God.

1240
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:42,910
不管是谁干的，都有别的动机，私人的动机。
Whoever did this has another motive, something personal.
