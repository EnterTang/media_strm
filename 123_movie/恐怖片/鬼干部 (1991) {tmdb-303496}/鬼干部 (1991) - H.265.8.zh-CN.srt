1
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,108
For 5 Thousand years

2
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,741
China never had any peaceful period for long

3
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:27,985
Because evils usually process those people

4
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,614
With supreme power

5
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,417
Like the brutal emperors in history

6
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,752
To fulfill their desires, lives were deserted

7
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,360
Civilian were the only class suffered

8
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:39,898
Luckily there were Devil Hunters

9
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,997
They sacrificed to battle against the evils

10
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:44,127
The evils were chained. But accidentally

11
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:46,328
Due to Battles and riots

12
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,834
The evils are released

13
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,233
And the world is in a bloodshed disaster again

14
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,847
The Japanese are coming

15
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,680
Don`t kill me

16
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,785
Japanese are coming

17
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:33,451
Don`t kill me, Help

18
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,856

20
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,491
Master, Help

21
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:49,664
Where is my wife?

22
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,165
She`s dead

23
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:01,340
Hurry

24
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,809
The Japs is massacring

25
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:05,943
Don`t

26
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:07,745
Look after my son

27
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:08,921

28
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,161

Please don`t

32
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,534
Brother

33
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,108
Kong, be careful

34
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:15,910
What`s the matter?

35
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:26,887
Brother

36
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:40,645
He`s your brother, watch out

37
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,207
Be careful

38
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:45,983
What shall we do?

39
00:04:56,863 --> 00:05:00,162
lt`s the Blood Demon, not me

40
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:01,390

Don`t come any closer

44
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:14,811
The Blood Demon got me

45
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:17,505
lf l`m caught, our people will be damned

46
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,015
Kill me, hurry

47
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,821

But l hope he can grow up like normal man

56
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:31,448
Any misfortune happens, just leave him to God

00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,248
Stab me

58
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:34,956

God will bless your soul

62
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,377
Where`s your brother?

63
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,091
My Dad won

64
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,442
Wise man must keep away from troubles

65
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,348
Why should l bother?

66
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,290
This is a painting against the Demon

67
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,187
You must take good care of it

68
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,394
Don`t use it unless it`s necessary

69
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,357
Hide the gavel at the Godness Temple

70
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,998
Hope Gods will bless the world

71

We`ll obey your words

72

Don`t let the children know too much

73

Right? Kong is brilliant

79
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,830
Lot of people praise him

80
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:41,480
Checkmate

00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,745
My uncle will win for sure

83
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,247
You think you are prophet

84
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:49,478
He lost already

85
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:53,489

lt`s going to rain, take your umbrella

No way you can win

93

Tung

94
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:25,787
Tung

95
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,187
Get lost, you don`t belong to this family

96
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,359
l don`t need your sympathy

97
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:31,358

Be careful

104
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:49,133
Stop it. Kong said your father doesn`t look good

105
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:51,667
Superstitious

106
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:02,113

lndividual is nothing in this new era

114
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,263
Personal sentiment must be left behind

115
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,968
and indulge in the flame of revolution

116
00:12:56,442 --> 00:13:01,311
Long live Cultural Revolution

firmly hold our position at the frontier

119
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,880

Why did you spray perfume in class

125

l have body odour, it smells

126
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,927
You are a capitalist

127
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,928
You want to use perfume to discourage

128
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,634
the student`s revolution spirit

129
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,733
You are a spy

130
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:26,061

You belong to a black scum`s family

You don`t have the right to speak

145
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,372
She tries to poison me with sentimentalism

146
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,945
ls she a capitalist?

147
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,481
Yes

148
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:19,924
We must draw a line between us and evils

149
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:24,789
No personal feeling in anti-class war

Get out of the way

156

00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,571
And draw a clear line

176
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:22,045
Chor, your name sounds traditional

177
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,440
And it comes from old society

178
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:26,307
Together with Kong, you`re evil beings

179
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:27,917
Scum of the society

180
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,821
You lead us to superstitious

181
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:35,219
You are anti-revolutionists

182
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,389
l will crash both of you

183
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,927
Kneel

184
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,626
Chor

185
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,798
Don`t hurt him, he`s sick

186
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,665
Please don`t

187
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,550
Kong, you must accuse Chor

188
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:06,157
Lenient if honest, severe if resist

189
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:08,986
My uncle is a good man, he`s not evil

190
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,663
He`s not your Dad. Why do you protect him?

191
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:14,957
l`ve nothing to say

192
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:18,165
You are out of your mind

193
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,634
Don`t talk to me, l`m not your son

194
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,304
l belong to the Party

195
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,805
l`m the son of New China

196
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,805
l have nothing to do with you

197
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,014
They are anti-revolutionists

198
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:33,377
They must be re-educate

199
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:34,584
You kneel down

200
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,050
Kong

201
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,346
Though l`m not well educated

202
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:38,783
l know what is right and what is wrong

203
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,458
lt never happen before for

204
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,818
the son to beat the father

205
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:48,626
Chor, confess to the people, loudly

206
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:52,666
l did nothing wrong, Tung

207
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:58,801
Stop calling my name. We are through

208
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,712
Today l am going to end your evil behaviour

209
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,580
Chor

210
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,185
We`re guilty

211
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:20,021
Chor, plead guilty

212
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:29,735
Who will accuse him? Come on

213
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:34,673
Ma, how about you? You`re their team leader

214
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,077
Alright, Comrades

215
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:38,611
Let me tell you their sin

216
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,215
He is absolute an evil being

217
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,456
He was a exocist before the country liberated

218
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,957
He cheated many of our people

219
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:50,588
Why don`t you tell our people before?

220
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:53,297
l am guilty

221
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,089
No need to bother you

222
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:58,200
l`ve prepared myself, look

223
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:01,468

224
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,971
l`m rotten. l knew some bad people and

225
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,043
l made some mistakes

226
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:14,275
l decide to reform and learn from the mass

227
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,612
Please give me a chance

228
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,724
We must rid the evil from the root

229
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,154
Rid the evil

230
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:27,855
Rebel is right

231
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,566
Take care of yourself, Auntie

232
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:36,196
We must destroy the evils

233
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,130
Comrades, our country is burning red

234
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:52,165
We see our future, we see our light

235
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:55,242
We`re student of our Chairman

236
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:08,824
Comrade, l`m not easy forget

237
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:10,585
You taught me 2 years ago

238
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,660
And you opened my mind. l improved a lot

239
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,435
So let`s carry on our revolution

240
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:28,438

241
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:42,193

to pay my debt to the party

246
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:04,748
They said you`re one of the best doctor

247
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,343
Work hard

248
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:08,619
and we`ll do what our superior instructed

249
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:11,615

250
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,593

Go and see what happen

252
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,170
We will move this mountain

253
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,422
Don`t panic

254
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,290
Move him over here

255
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:57,626

Stop his bleeding now

257
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:04,731
Captain, it`s a chain

258
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:21,485
Pull it. l`ll go check it out

259
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:25,388
Yes Sir, Come on, Pull

260
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:28,031
Tung, this mountain look weird

261
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,894
l`m afraid something may go wrong

262
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:31,968
Get lost

263
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:33,997
Tung

264
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:54,981
Stop it! l have a bad feeling about this

265
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:59,693
Stop it now

266
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:02,195
This is a matter of the country

267
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:03,458
Not your personal buisness

268
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,060
Keep on pulling

269
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:57,904
These rotten cultural scums

270
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:59,946
We must crash the anti-literal authorities

271
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:02,650
You`re capitalists` ruuning dogs, black scum

272
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:03,911
want to try something?

273
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:05,554
We must crash black scums

274
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:29,806
Something stabbed at the heart, What is it?

275
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:31,876
Ancient treasures?

276
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:35,780
Would it be an ancient emperor`s tomb

277
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,831
Who is he? l feel l met him before

278
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:55,905
Don`t touch it, it`s weird

279
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,400
Don`t say such superstitious words

280
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:01,075
You want to be re-educated again

281
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,178
Kong, for the sake of the family, leave it

282
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:08,108
Comrade

283

Thank you

292
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:44,673
Tung, come over

293
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:49,505
His pulse is abnormal

294
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:51,237
lt seems something tries to force its way out

295
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,108
Looks like not that serious

296
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:06,219
Let`s welcome officier Lui

297
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:12,161

00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:36,491
Dad

300
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,290
You grow stronger

301
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:40,998
Because of hard work

302
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,358
Officer Lui, this way please

Please take a rest

306
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:54,535
before you speak to everyone here

307
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:57,205
Officer Lui takes a long trip to visit us

308
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:59,973
Let`s make a warm welcome to Officier Lui

309
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,119
Thank you for your hard work

310
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:30,109
No matter what had happened, it`s history

311
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:38,921
You know him?

312
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:40,886
Now it`s time for reunion

313
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:42,983
Lui, Remember?

314
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,056

He got a bad time but now he`s clean again

316
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:52,427
The Government likes him and promote him

317
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:54,704
You punished him before

318
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:57,731
We just did our best for our country

319
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:00,034
Every one here was a warrior before

320
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:02,675
We didn`t have other alternatives

321
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:04,073
Let`s forget the past

322
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:11,377
To die for the country

323
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:12,953
ls a honour of revolution class

324
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:14,350
The Party will take care of his business

325
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,082
Comrade Lui

326
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,520
Take a rest here

327
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,626
Applause everyone

328
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:32,138
KlLL

329
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:53,249
Let go! Respect the leader

330
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:06,328
A anti-revolutionist just attacked our leader

331
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:09,699
We will investigate the case

332
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,700
And we will complete a detail report

333
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:18,006
on this accident

334
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,143
Then we go into meeting to discuss

335
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:24,982
How to avoid this happen again

336
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:27,019
The conclusion`ll be handed to our leader

337
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,749
Then pass to the seniors to examine

338
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:33,990
lf there`s proofs showing that there`s enemies

339
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,597
Hiding within us and create chaos

340
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:41,134
We`ll plan how to find out the enemies

341
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:45,141
And punish him according to the regulations

342
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,104
Excuse me, Officer

343
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,641
A lot of people is bleeding

344
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,912
Please allow me to take care of them

345
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:19,273
Comrade Tung

346
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:20,976
Comrade Shan

347
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,874
l know you joined the parade at Beijing

348
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:25,477
l remember it was on December 26

349
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:28,781
Everyone was ready at 3 in the morning

350
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:31,314
We kept waiting until 4pm the next day

351
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,523
Then our Chairman appeared

352
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:35,726
He was far from me. l only saw a shadow of him

353
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,157
l was moved, and l cried

354
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:40,523
Did everyone cry?

355
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:43,595
Some didn`t because their tears became urines

356
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:47,298
No man can control his bladder for over 10 hrs

357
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:49,865
But they couldn`t leave so their pants were wet

358
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:53,571
Don`t laugh. Don`t joke at revolution

359
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:55,143
Beware get punished when campaign come

360
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:57,380
l think you won`t do that

361
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:01,677
lt was a mistake, sorry

362
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:03,380
My father is a good man

363
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:06,118
Anyway, your reputation is restored

364
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:07,515
Shall we celebrate?

365
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:11,119
l want to visit your home tonight

366
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,828
and share your revolution experience

367
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:14,321
l don`t think it`s a good idea

368
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:30,206
Revolution is not buying someone dinner

369
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:34,044
Nor writing an poem, nor painting a protrait

370
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:35,808
Revolution is not leisure

371
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,715
Not elegant, not humble

372
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:41,354
Neither it`s not gentle at all

373
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:43,692
Revolution is violent

374
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:46,555
lt means a class overthrow another class

375
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,026
lt means bloodshed

376
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,255
Father

377
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,368
Political power means everything

378
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:55,128
You lose it, you lose everything

379
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,740
Father

380
00:37:58,042 --> 00:37:59,031
Stop

381
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,377
Political power means everything

382
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:11,586
You lose it, you lose everything

383
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,717
l want to learn from Comrade Tung

384
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,790
Political power means everything

385
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:19,689
You lose it, you lose everything

386
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:25,602
Dear, revolution is a long road

387
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,537
l know, that`s why l want to learn from him

388
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:34,273
l`ll pay a visit to him later this evening

389
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:36,912
Since he is an experience revolutionist

390
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:38,613
Beside he is now no longer our enemy

391
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:40,281
We`re on the same frontier

392
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:41,583
l have no second intention

393
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:43,319
Just want to learn from him

394
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,352
What the hell l`m talking?

395
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:07,640
After that tragedy, Mum...

396
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:14,915
Please don`t mention those bad old days

397
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:23,593
Auntie

398
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:25,659
Kong, Mum is inside

399
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,832
Auntie

400
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:36,197
Auntie, it`s me

401
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:40,701
l brought some pork for you

402
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:43,513
Preserve it will be nice

403
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:45,975
l am Kong

404
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:18,412
Auntie

405
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:25,520
Look, this is pork

406
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:35,596
l admit it

407
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:38,227
Auntie

408
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:40,094
l tell the truth

409
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:41,669
Auntie

410
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:44,602
Mum

411
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,608
She is Comrade Shan

412
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:49,746
Her Dad is our city`s revolution officer

413
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,716
Just call me Shan

414
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:57,616
No, l don`t want revolution

415
00:40:57,888 --> 00:40:58,820
Mum, don`t be afraid

416
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:01,114
She just come to say hello

417
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,722
Don`t panic

418
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,296
She was awarded sometime ago

419
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:12,363
Mum, don`t be afraid

420
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:17,232
Auntie, have some water

421
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:33,384
Kong, please stay with Mum. l`ll prepare dinner

422
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:42,595
Shan, she`s alright

423
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:10,117
Once l was red, flaming red

424
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,763
So what? lt means nothing

425
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:18,256
Today l`m red, then black tomorrow

426
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,404
Few days later, the campaign come

427
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:23,300
Then l`m red again

428
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:27,333
Sometimes l doubt myself

429
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:29,442
Can revolution be a lifetime career

430
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:33,040
Tung, you change a lot these years

431
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:34,614
You`re not active as before

432
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:42,185
Yes, l want a simple life

433
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:44,394
and stay by my Mum for the rest of her life

434
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:47,426
What l`m looking for now is peace

435
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:57,265
Mum is the only person l care

436
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:02,077
How about your uncle, is he released?

437
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:04,780
Chor, get down

438
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:08,212
Get him down or you all will be punished

439
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:10,912
Get down, don`t risk your life

440
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:14,588
Don`t be stubborn. Get down

441
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:17,353
Get down

442
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:20,597
Get down please

443
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,122
Mum

444
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:26,631
Go to see your father

445
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:35,704
l`m not guilty

446
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:37,903
Get down and we`ll talk

447
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:41,049
l`ll forgive you no matter what you did before

448
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:43,783
Chor

449
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:46,050
You must take good care of your Mum

450
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:51,455
Chor My son

451
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:56,831
Read, you must read as much as you can

452
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:04,538
Chor

453
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:23,091
Dead? Good! Long live the Chairman

454
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:39,374
Long live the Chairman

455
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:10,897
We have the same blood in our body

456
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:15,109
Do not start awar among our own people

457
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:17,505
Don`t go revolution

458
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,382
We don`t need a revolution

459
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:46,733
He`s dead. All he left is a painting

460
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,051
l met my father

461
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:03,182
Fu Hse Needle? Godness Marble?

462
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:06,588
Can they be found nowaday?

463
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,291
The Blood Demon

464
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:11,857
He`s dead

465
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:15,301
We are in the New Era now

466
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:16,938
Don`t give Mum a hard time. Just forget it

467
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:22,075
lt`s over anyway

468
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:32,478
l swear l`ll keep my mouth shut

469
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:35,257
You can trust me

470
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:39,952
Swear? We need loyalty, not words

471
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:43,563
Kong, you leave first

472
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:46,494
Look after my Mum for me

473
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:48,994
l tell you what l feel

474
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:50,206
lf it`s an old furniture

475
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,203
An old clothes or piece of torn paper

476
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:53,936
l can abandon them

477
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:56,508
But she is my mother

478
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:57,839
l can`t leave her like that

479
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:01,016
lf someone with power is processed

480
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:02,149
The world will be in chaos

481
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:03,977
More lives will be wasted

482
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:06,950
Everyone is forced to kill during revolution

483
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:08,522
Are they all Blood Demon?

484
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:11,084
Don`t you think Lui is strange?

485
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:17,118
Thank you very much

486
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:18,760
l`ll see you in the gathering day after

487
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:29,830
Comrade Shan is a nice girl

488
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:31,771
You interested in her?

489
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:38,344
No mood for that in this kind of situation

490
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:39,515
You`re kidding

491
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,222
Right to rebel, Long live Revolution

492
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:50,450
Hello Comrades

493
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:51,650
You 2 get along well with the Officer`s lady

494
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:53,259
You don`t have to worry anything

495
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:55,157
Have a cigarette

496
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,729
Please take care of me in future

497
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,895
You`re kidding. l don`t have the power

498
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:02,562
Then you must have a problem

499
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:06,038
Thank you

500
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:09,504
My stomach was in riot momments ago

501
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:11,213
Lucky that l kept recite the regulations

502
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:13,712
Now every bad scums were thrown out

503
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:15,814
All evils and enemies are driven away

504
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:17,213
By the working class

505
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:21,655
My Father and his parnter fought a devil

506
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:24,455
Before the country liberated

507
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:25,753
l heard that you were with them

508
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:28,829
Really? l remember nothing

509
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:30,430
Even if l can, l won`t tell you

510
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:33,064
l know my question is stupid

511
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:37,406
May be you`ll accuse me if l tell you

512
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,871
But honestly, l remember nothing

513
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:43,044
l was a kid and how can you expect me

514
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:45,713
To understand what they did

515
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,778
Now all l want is avoiding all troubles

516
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:50,553
So your business is not mine. Good night

517
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,734
You mean your father`s temper changes

518
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:50,270
He used to be very gentle

519
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,876
l have a strange feeling recently

520
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,820
Do you believe the Blood Demon rumor?

521
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,088
The world is bigger than we think

522
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:02,823
Our knowledge is limited

523
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:05,419
Though there`s no proof

524
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:09,497
lt was told my our ansectors since decades ago

525
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:12,362
There must be a reason for it

526
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,427
Then l`m Blood Demon`s daughter

527
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:18,738
No joking

528
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:20,807
Demon`s daughter, you are a spy

529
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:24,010
Tell me what do you like to find out

530
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:26,314
Let`s stop the nonsence

531
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:31,749
What is your interest?

532
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:36,955
Let me guess

533
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:39,525
Even when l`m listening to Beethoven#9

534
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:42,729
l just want to dance

535
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:48,527
Am l corrupted?

536
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:52,605
But now l don`t read the regulations anymore

537
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:55,705
That`s better

538
00:51:58,014 --> 00:52:01,677
The best thingis nobody`ll treat as enemy

539
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:04,750
lf l`m mistreated, l`ll revenge

540
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,850
lf l`m gifted, l`ll reward

541
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:26,408
We must understand the truth of revolution

542
00:52:29,045 --> 00:52:33,641
We will succeed only if we get the key point

543
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:36,216
The ``Ocean group`` must surrender

544
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:43,625
There`s only 1 rebel group in 1 city

545
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:51,861
ln this city, we are the only one

546
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:53,801
Correct

547
00:52:57,741 --> 00:53:01,404
They say Chinese love peace. Wrong

548
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:05,845
They love War and l`m one of them

549
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:09,311
Our war plan against the ``Ocean group``

550
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,350
Must be ready in 3 days

551
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:15,755
Thank you

552
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:20,056
Comrade, we`ll follow your instruction

553
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:21,889
Fine

554
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:42,250
Comrade Wu

555
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,679
Do you have a problem?

556
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:48,521
No, but l`m afraid many student will die

557
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:52,586
ln the contact between us and the ``Ocean group``

558
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:59,167
lt`s not a big deal

559
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,997
China is over populated

560
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:06,369
Our enemies must die

561
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:10,070
Are you afraid?

562
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:17,147
Comrade Lui, l`m not clear about my mission

563
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:21,119
l like to have a 3 months sick leave

564
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:26,656
And let me think thoughly

565
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:28,661
Excuse me

566

Can`t you reconigze your father

567
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:32,045
Anything special, Comrade Ma?

568
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:39,725
l found an ancient treasure. lt`s valuable

569
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:47,694
Please take it

570
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:56,939
You try to pollut my soul with

571
00:56:57,313 --> 00:56:58,837
This kind of Capitalist` luxuries

572
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:03,211
No, l didn`t mean that

573
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:07,722
Really? Now l order you a mission

574
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,554
Sorry for my ignorance

575
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:15,057
Thank you for teaching me

576
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:16,356
Please give me your order

577
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,624
l don`t care how you do it?

578
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:22,166
To blow, burn or any way you can think of

579
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:25,201
Just to destroy it

580
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:28,209
Yes, l`ll do my best

581
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:29,570
To destroy the enemies in front of us

582
00:57:36,553 --> 00:57:40,785
Good, Comrade Ma, you`ll be promoted to

583
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,858

His ancestor was a devil hunter

587
00:57:56,906 --> 00:57:58,601
l know him and l want him as well

588
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:00,774
His mind is polluted

589
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,241
l intended to bring him to you few days ago

590
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:07,605
He mentioned something about a needle

591
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:10,719
He also suspects you

592
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:56,480
Comrade Ma

593
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:04,925

lf you fail me, you`ll be damned

597
01:00:25,588 --> 01:00:29,149
You want to join them to against me? Go!

598
01:01:07,797 --> 01:01:10,960
Why?

599

600

01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:32,752

One of you be be the bait

603

Allow Blood Demon process you

604
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:48,435
Then stab the neddle into the bait`s heart

605
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:02,310
Mum...

606
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:07,579
He is here

01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:09,749
Mum...

608
01:02:16,365 --> 01:02:19,960
You can`t let it kill again

609
01:02:20,636 --> 01:02:26,165
Someone must sacrifice and die with it

610
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,341
Mum, what happen?

611

619
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:06,657
All temples were cracked down in riots

620
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,768
lt`s all rocks only, let`s leave

627
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:44,367
l`m not coward. l`m not afraid

628
01:05:51,814 --> 01:05:55,443
Don`t sacrifly for nothing

629
01:05:59,722 --> 01:06:03,488
Go, hurry

630

Go

635
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,118
Get them

636
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:58,772
You can`t escape from me

637
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:48,651
Tung, watch out

638
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:55,297
Get away Tung

639
01:09:11,847 --> 01:09:12,905
Tung

640
01:09:14,016 --> 01:09:15,108
My leg

641
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:17,581
Are you okay, let`s move

642
01:09:25,094 --> 01:09:26,186
l can`t walk

643
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:27,362
Tung

644
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:29,030
Kong, you go first

645
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:29,992
There`s only 2 of us left

646
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:31,258
No, l carry you

647
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:37,738
Dying together is meaningless. 1 of us must live

648
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,065
Remember tell people that you`re a Red Guard

649
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:42,435
When you are on the road

650
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:44,576
Go now

651
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:49,781
Take care

652
01:09:51,453 --> 01:09:52,385
You too

653
01:09:52,588 --> 01:09:55,386
Kong, run to those places with riots

654
01:09:55,724 --> 01:09:57,624
lt`s safer in those places

655
01:10:42,671 --> 01:10:44,866
Where is the other?

656
01:10:49,511 --> 01:10:51,206
l`m in trouble

657
01:11:47,069 --> 01:11:48,263
Where are your parent?

658
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:51,739
You`re enemies of revolution class

659
01:11:52,007 --> 01:11:53,736
You must go to reform class

660
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:57,775
l haven`t eat for a few days. l`m starving

661
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:05,652
Why take my bum?

662
01:12:17,266 --> 01:12:19,200
Aren`t you ashame to rob a kid?

663
01:13:05,981 --> 01:13:08,040
You bastards

664
01:13:08,317 --> 01:13:10,182
We are bastards, and what are you?

665
01:13:11,487 --> 01:13:12,681
l am a Red Guard

666
01:13:13,188 --> 01:13:16,521
Me too. So what?

667
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:19,556
The Government say they don`t need us now

668
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,993
We are abandoned

669
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:27,464
See, the Red Guard`s badge

670
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:28,964
10 Kg for 1 cent

671
01:13:29,938 --> 01:13:32,372
l`m also a University student

672
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:35,043
But one thing we are in common

673
01:13:35,544 --> 01:13:38,240
We are both starving

674
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:56,263
Wait, Comrade

675
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:05,630
Let me cure you

676
01:15:03,532 --> 01:15:07,024
Where is Kong? Talk

677
01:15:07,402 --> 01:15:09,768
What makes you change like this, Dad?

678
01:15:10,005 --> 01:15:11,267
l am your daughter

679
01:15:12,574 --> 01:15:18,012
l`m not your father. To achieve my goal

680
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:21,539
A line must drawn between you and me

681
01:15:21,783 --> 01:15:24,752
l`ll not trust anybody

682
01:15:25,053 --> 01:15:25,985

As long as Kong survives

Your plan will fail

You have to trust my last word

711

Kong, run, leave us alone

712
