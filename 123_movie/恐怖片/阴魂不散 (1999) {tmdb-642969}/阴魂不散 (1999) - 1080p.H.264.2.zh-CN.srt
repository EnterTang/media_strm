What are you
doing up, sweetie?

28
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,847
Did you have
another bad dream?

29
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,916
I dreamed
about a swing.

30
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:07,252
Is there one
at the new house?

31
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,388
Well, if there isn't,

32
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,623
I bet your daddy might
just put one up for you.

( chuckles )

34

Come on, let's go
get some breakfast, okay?

35
00:03:16,664 --> 00:03:18,564

Girl:
<i>Can we bring my bike?</i>

41
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,525
Girl:
<i>Even though I don't know</i>
<i>how to ride it yet.</i>

42
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:49,261
Lisa:
<i>You are gonna have</i>
<i>lots of places</i>

43
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:50,862
<i>To learn</i>
<i>how to ride your bike.</i>

44

00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,238
( laughs )

46
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,739
Oh! Mmm!

47
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,308
- You done good, daddy.
- Why, thank you.

48
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,477
What about you, huh?
What do you think?

49
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:08,280
- Who lived there before?
- Nobody, honey.

50
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:10,649
That's why the bank gave us
such a good deal, right?

51
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:13,385
- Thank you, mama.
- Mwah!

52
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:14,853
<i>Well, maybe you'd</i>
<i>rather live in there.</i>

53
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:17,623
- No.
- That can be arranged.

54
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,292
- No, thank you.
- You'd have the whole place
to yourself.

55
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:21,727
- Nope.
- Teddy bear could
have his own room.

56
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:23,428
Come on, let's go.
I'll race ya. Come on.

57
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,330
Go, go, go.

Oh, what
the hell, baby?

60
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:43,282
You can't find a clearer
station than that?

61
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:44,850
We're out
in the boondocks, babe.

62
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:46,785
We're lucky we get
running water. Thank you.

63
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,920
Well, we don't need water.
That's what beer is for.

64
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:51,423
- Mm-hmm.
- This is my beer,
by the way.

65
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:54,760
- Mm-mmm.

Kid, you grow
like a weed.

80
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:11,470
Hi.

81
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:13,472
Look at you,
miss homeowner.

( laughing )

83
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:18,377
That didn't take long.

84
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:19,678
No suitcase?

85
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,614
I am not
a freeloader, andy.

86
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:24,783
- Today or historically?
- Stop it, andy.

87
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:26,918
Joyce is just here
to wish us well.

88
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,587
Is that so?

89
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,059
It's a goddamn curse
being right all the time.

90
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,495
It truly is.

91
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,901
Joyce:
<i>It didn't work out</i>
<i>with ray.</i>

92
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,704
Was he the married one
or the drunk?

93
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:47,806
Bit of both,
it turns out.

94
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:49,474
- ( chuckles )
- lisa: What about you?

95
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:51,510
- Are you...?
- <i>11 weeks sober.</i>

96

<i>- Andy: Shit, call guinness.</i>

97
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,746

<i>- Andy:</i> <i>On second thought,</i>

98
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,449
<i>That's probably</i>
<i>a bad idea.</i>

99
00:06:57,451 --> 00:07:00,986

<i>- Voices:</i> <i>Heidi.</i>

<i>Heidi...</i>

00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,757
Joyce:
<i>I've got alimony coming in.</i>

102
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,926
I want to be near family.

103
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:11,029
Well, find
a place near here.
Just not here.

104
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,900
Who lives over there?

105
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:16,802
That's just some old wreck
someone left behind.

106
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:18,870
- <i>I'm gonna haul it away.</i>
<i>- A girl lives down there.</i>

107
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,973
Hmm? Nobody lives
around here, baby.

108
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:24,843
- When'd you see a girl?
- Just now.

109
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,846
You know,
I've lived in worse.

110
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,117
"near here,
but not here," right?

111
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,985
You did
say that, babe.

112

<i>- ( sobbing )</i>

Why are you

123
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,746
It's nothing, sweetie.
It's nothing.

124
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,884
Aunt joyce is out front,
so go say good night.

00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:17,589
Okay.

Heidi:
<i>Mama's crying.</i>

128
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:28,099
Do you know why
she gets sad?

129
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,205
Your mama...

130
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,341
Gets feelings
sometimes.

131
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:38,610
Feelings she doesn't
much care for.

132
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,212
What kind
of feelings?

133
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:44,349
Tell you what.
I want you to try
something for me.

134

Can you do that?

135
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:48,587
Look out there.

136
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,124
At what?

137
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,327
Don't really focus
on anything specific.

138
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:58,763
Just take it
all in.

139

Woman:
<i>Help us.</i>

143
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,682
- I think so.
- <i>Help us.</i>

144
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:20,218
And sometimes...

145
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,787
I see things.

146
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,924
( sighs )

147
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:29,227
That's 'cause you were born
with a veil, sweetie,

148
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:32,797
Just like your mama
and me and our mama.

149
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,833
What's a veil?

150
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,004
It means that
when you were born

151
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:41,973
You had a sheen over
your face like a wedding veil.

152
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,042
<i>And sometimes folks</i>
<i>born that way have a gift.</i>

They can--

154
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:50,015
They can sense certain things
that other people can't.

155
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,818
Mama never said
anything about it.

156
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,254
Your mama doesn't like
this kind of talk

your influence
coming out in her.

want you talking about any

00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:57,802
You hear me?
She's my daughter.

316
00:23:57,804 --> 00:23:59,136
She can talk
about it with me.

317
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:02,106
Why would she?
You don't listen.

318
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,675
You just tell her what's what
just like you did with me.

319
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:06,744
You needed it.
You know what?
You still do.

320
00:24:06,746 --> 00:24:08,145
I suppose I'd be better off
numbing myself with pills?

321
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:10,648
- Stop it.
- You don't think I know?

322
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,451
That was
mama's trick, too.

323
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:15,586
And that worked out
beautifully for her.

324
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:17,488
Joyce, go home.

325

Oh.

337
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:24,255
<i>Folks around here</i>

When this rather special
piece of property would sell.

339
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:29,627
Yeah?
What's special about it?

340

- Pastor jordan wells.

342
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:36,834
<i>The property</i>
<i>is special</i>

343
00:25:36,836 --> 00:25:39,136
Because back around
the time of the civil war,

344
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:42,306
It was
the stationmaster's land.
But I'm sure you knew that.

345
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:45,242
What, like a railroad?
No tracks on this land.

346
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:47,978
No, it wasn't
that kind of railroad.

347
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,881
Do you mean, like,
the underground railroad?

348
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:54,051
Folks who helped escaped
slaves make it up north?

349
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:57,288
That's right.
Those people were known
as "stationmasters."

350
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:01,292
And one of the
most well-known lived
right here on your land.

351
00:26:01,294 --> 00:26:03,561
He actually hid slaves
on our property?

352
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:06,630
Yes, ma'am.
Hundreds of men,
women, and children

353
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:09,767
Passed right through here
with nothing but the clothes
on their back

354
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:11,635
<i>And the light of the moon</i>
<i>to guide them.</i>

355
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:14,672
- They didn't have flashlights?
- Oh, no, sweetie.

356
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:16,807
<i>They couldn't even</i>
<i>use lanterns.</i>

357
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:20,277
The moonlight was the only
light that they ever saw.

358
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,179
<i>It was the light</i>
<i>of freedom</i>

359
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:24,348
And the promised land.

360
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:28,052
The stationmaster was
an extraordinary man.

361
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:31,055
Entire generations
of families would not exist

362
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:32,957
If it was not
for the stationmaster

363
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:35,092
And this piece of land.

364
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,595
So, don't be surprised

365

from time to time.

00:36:21,547 --> 00:36:23,413
It's a trap.

473
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:26,349
You see, you bait
that chamber there.

474
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:29,352
The animals, they get in
and they can't get back out.

475
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:32,355
They get weak and starve.
Easy pickings.

476
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:33,657
Hmm.

477
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:36,193
Then you get 'em
back out through here.

478
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:37,861
A back door.

479
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:39,729
There's got to be
a better way to hunt.

480
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:41,865
- That's just cruel.
- <i>No, it's smart.</i>

481
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:44,234
If you're
a taxidermist.

482
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:46,570
<i>I already found</i>
<i>three more of them</i>
<i>in the woods.</i>

483
00:36:46,572 --> 00:36:49,372
Figure they made good money
for someone back in...

484
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:53,276
Well, whenever the hell
they still used locks
like these.

485
00:36:53,278 --> 00:36:56,580
Well, smash 'em all up
so chief doesn't get
stuck in them again.

486
00:36:56,582 --> 00:36:58,582
Or heidi,
for that matter.

487
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:03,887
<i>( thunder rumbling )</i>

488
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,285
I love you, lisa.
Don't be afraid.

489
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,355
Let them in.

490
00:37:38,357 --> 00:37:40,323
- <i>Let them in.</i>
<i>- ( gasps )</i>

491
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:41,658
<i>( thunder crashing )</i>

492
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,660
( faint squeaking )

493
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,568
( gasps )

494
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,870
Oh.

495
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:56,773
Hey.

496
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,042
What's going on, huh?

497
00:37:59,044 --> 00:38:00,677
Oh, god.

498
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,898
( grunts )

499
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,968
I have a bike.
Do you?

500
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:28,571
Oh, it's pretty.

501
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:31,374
It's purpley.
( giggles )

502
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:34,411
What do you mean?

503
00:38:34,413 --> 00:38:36,646
Really?
People are coming?

504
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:38,982
What kind of people?

505
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:40,750
Who are you
talking to now?

506
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:42,719
Mr. Gordy.

507
00:38:42,721 --> 00:38:44,487
That right?

508
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:47,023
Ask him where
there's more money.

509
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:49,626
I can't.
He's gone.

510
00:38:49,628 --> 00:38:52,595
Next time, then.

511
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:54,864
He said there's
people coming.

512
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:56,433
Who?

513
00:38:56,435 --> 00:38:58,535
<i>( rustling )</i>

514
00:38:58,537 --> 00:39:01,871
I swear, heidi,
we should take you
and mr. Gordy on the road.

515
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:04,741
Who's there?

516
00:39:04,743 --> 00:39:06,976
Stay behind me.

517
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,549
I got an ax.

518
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,459
Hello?

519
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,477
What the hell
is this place?

520
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,500
( gasps )

521
00:40:03,502 --> 00:40:06,436
- Do you see her, too?
- Yeah.

522
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,675
Mama kay?

523
00:40:12,677 --> 00:40:14,644
- Whoa, whoa.
- ( heidi gasps )

524
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:17,013
It's okay.
My name is prentiss.

525
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:19,416
<i>This is my grandmother</i>
<i>mama kay.</i>

526
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:21,584
- <i>This your property?</i>
<i>- That you're trespassing on?</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

527
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,486
We were told
we could come back here.

528
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:24,721
Bullshit.
By who?

529
00:40:24,723 --> 00:40:26,856
Woman
in the trailer.

530
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:28,758
Said she's your sister.
Sold us this.

531
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:32,796
Sister-in-law.
What is that?

532
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:35,131
Shoofly.

533
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:37,700
<i>Prentiss?</i>

534
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:40,537
Now help me
sit on down.

535
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:42,939
I want to visit
with the little one.

536
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,575
<i>Come on, little one.</i>

537
00:40:45,577 --> 00:40:47,477
It'll be all right,
young man.

538
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,115
Andy:
All right, you gonna tell me
why you came all the way

539
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:54,050
Out here just to buy
some ratty old quilt?

540
00:40:54,052 --> 00:40:57,454
Prentiss: Long time ago,
when this quilt was hung
out here in these woods,

541
00:40:57,456 --> 00:40:59,923
It meant it was safe
to approach.

542
00:40:59,925 --> 00:41:02,025
Safe for who?

543
00:41:02,027 --> 00:41:03,860
Mama kay's ancestors,
for one.

544
00:41:03,862 --> 00:41:05,562
Mine, too.

545
00:41:05,564 --> 00:41:07,831
Do you even know
where you're living
at, mister...?

546
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:09,165
Andy.

547
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:13,102
Our pastor said
we might get visitors.

548
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:14,737
Something about
the underground railroad.

549
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:16,573
This was one
of the stations.

550
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:22,111
<i>Mama kay's always wanted</i>
<i>to visit this place.</i>

551
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:23,813
Guy saved a lot of lives,
I reckon.

552
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:26,149
And he deserved better
than what happened to him.

553
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:30,920
You don't need eyes
to see, little one.

554
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:32,789
But you already
know that.

555
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:34,491
What do you mean?

556
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:39,229
You asked your father
if he saw me.

557
00:41:39,231 --> 00:41:42,599
That makes you
some kind of special.

558
00:41:42,601 --> 00:41:45,101
My mama says I'm not
supposed to talk about that.

559
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:47,270
But you
have to be careful

560
00:41:47,272 --> 00:41:49,205
With a gift
like that.

561
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:51,107
'cause sometimes

562
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:54,711
The devil looks
a gentleman.

563
00:41:57,715 --> 00:42:00,049
Andy:
You're telling me...

564
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:03,620
All that took place
on my property?

565
00:42:03,622 --> 00:42:05,021
Yes, sir.

566
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,691
Right here.

567
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,927
Guess your pastor
left that part out.

568
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:13,029
Yeah.

569
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:15,732
( laughing )

570
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:20,637
Family meeting.

571
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,139
Whoa, whoa.

572
00:42:23,141 --> 00:42:25,074
Not you, kiddo.

573
00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:26,976
You stay outside
for a minute, all right?

574
00:42:26,978 --> 00:42:28,845
Okay, daddy.

575
00:42:28,847 --> 00:42:31,881
Sit down, joyce.

576
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:39,989
Heidi:
<i>That man told daddy what</i>
<i>happened here, didn't he?</i>

577
00:42:39,991 --> 00:42:41,925
<i>Why can't I know?</i>

578
00:42:41,927 --> 00:42:43,560
Lisa:
<i>It's just not a story</i>
<i>for little girls, sweetie.</i>

579
00:42:43,562 --> 00:42:45,295
I'm a big girl.
You always say that.

580
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:50,600
You remember
pastor wells talking
about the stationmaster?

581
00:42:50,602 --> 00:42:52,135
<i>( bell ringing )</i>

582
00:42:52,137 --> 00:42:54,137
<i>Well, back when he</i>
<i>owned all this land,</i>

583
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:57,707
<i>He was what's called</i>
<i>a taxidermist.</i>

584
00:42:57,709 --> 00:43:01,277
<i>He also did something that</i>
<i>he didn't tell anybody.</i>

585
00:43:01,279 --> 00:43:03,913
He would help
hide people

586
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:05,848
That were
in trouble.

587
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:10,119
<i>People like mama kay's</i>
<i>great aunt nell</i>

588
00:43:10,121 --> 00:43:12,789
<i>And her fiancé levi.</i>

589
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:15,224
Prentiss:
<i>See, nell and levi</i>
<i>had fallen in love</i>

590
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:19,596
And had dreams
of getting married once
they were safe and free.

591
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,333
How the hell did people
even find their way out here?

592
00:43:23,335 --> 00:43:25,668
There were guides
called conductors

593
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:28,271
Who helped them.
And these quilts,

594
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:30,974
They were a code from
the stationmaster telling
them where'd he meet them.

595
00:43:30,976 --> 00:43:33,276
- Look here.
You see this tree?
- Yeah.

596
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:37,947
<i>There it is down there.</i>
<i>The meeting place.</i>

597
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,049
The stationmaster
would come get them

598
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:42,051
And take them
to a hiding place,

599
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:43,353
Somewhere
on this property,

600
00:43:43,355 --> 00:43:46,389
Until it was safe
to move on.

601
00:43:46,391 --> 00:43:49,325
Well, some of
the other landowners,

602
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:53,630
They found out
what the stationmaster
had been doing

603
00:43:53,632 --> 00:43:56,366
<i>And, well, they didn't</i>
<i>like it very much.</i>

604
00:43:56,368 --> 00:44:00,903
<i>So they did some</i>
<i>very unkind things to him.</i>

605
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:06,275
( groaning )

606
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:15,385
They hurt him
just for helping people?

607
00:44:15,387 --> 00:44:16,953
Well, they didn't see it
that way, sweetie.

608
00:44:16,955 --> 00:44:20,390
What happened to nell?
She make it up north?

609
00:44:20,392 --> 00:44:23,226
Nell and levi
never arrived.

610
00:44:23,228 --> 00:44:25,061
No one knows
what happened to them.

611
00:44:25,063 --> 00:44:27,864
Heidi:
<i>I told you something bad</i>
<i>happened here.</i>

612
00:44:27,866 --> 00:44:29,699
Lisa:
<i>No, it was</i>
<i>a long time ago.</i>

613
00:44:29,701 --> 00:44:32,268
All of that evil
is over and done with now.

614
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:34,737
It's still here, mama.
I can feel it.

615
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:37,073
It's in the woods.
It's coming for me.

616
00:44:37,075 --> 00:44:38,808
No, it's not.

617
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:42,679
Heidi, it's all
in your head.

618
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:45,214
- It's not real.
- But mr. Gordy said--

619
00:44:45,216 --> 00:44:48,818
There is
no mr. Gordy.

620
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,319
Heidi, listen to me.

621
00:44:50,321 --> 00:44:52,321
You have to fight this.

622
00:44:52,323 --> 00:44:55,024
You have to put it
out of your head or--

623
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:56,693
I'll be like you?

624
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:08,337
Dry off.

625
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:10,473
If you loved me,
you'd believe me.

626
00:45:10,475 --> 00:45:13,242
It's because I love you
that I can't, baby.

627
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:23,920
I don't hear you
getting out of that tub.

628
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:30,126
Heidi wyrick,

From the mind and
the soul of this child.

With the warmth
of your love into
her heart.

<i>from danger.</i>

678

Mom and dad, would you
lean down and lay her
back for me, please?

Heidi.
Oh, jesus.

794

How the hell did you
get down here, baby, huh?

795
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:04,800
What the hell?

796
01:00:04,802 --> 01:00:07,636
This is where
the stationmaster hid 'em.

797
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:12,107
Unbelievable.

798
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:14,910
How the hell did you
find this place, heidi, huh?

799
01:00:14,912 --> 01:00:17,145
A girl showed me.

800
01:00:17,147 --> 01:00:18,914
Is that the one that you said
was down here with you?

801
01:00:18,916 --> 01:00:20,048
No.

802
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:26,922
( sobs )

803
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:33,629
I think something else
is down here, too, daddy.

804
01:00:33,631 --> 01:00:36,031
I don't want
to be here anymore.

805
01:00:36,033 --> 01:00:38,834

834

Those people in the chamber
wanted to be found.

<i>I went in the hole</i>

sweetie?

848
01:02:32,282 --> 01:02:34,216
The stationmaster.

<i>I let him out, mama.</i>

850

851
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:40,455
That the stationmaster
was a good man.

852

No, he wasn't.

853

Andy, will you please
tell her that there is
nothing to be afraid of?

854
01:02:47,797 --> 01:02:50,031
Mr. Gordy said there was money
buried in the garden, lisa,

855
01:02:50,033 --> 01:02:51,399
And there was.

856
01:02:51,401 --> 01:02:53,902
He said that

857
01:02:53,904 --> 01:02:56,071
Something terrible
happened here, it did.

858

For something
in heidi's mind,

859

Mr. Gordy is sure
as hell right a lot.

860
01:03:00,477 --> 01:03:02,344
Are you telling me that
suddenly you believe all this?

861
01:03:02,346 --> 01:03:04,412
<i>I believe there was a cave</i>

862
01:03:04,414 --> 01:03:06,815
Lisa,

863
01:03:06,817 --> 01:03:10,051
Was there a bad man
down there, too?

864
01:03:10,053 --> 01:03:11,987
Hell if I know,

865
01:03:11,989 --> 01:03:14,156
But I say
we pack up the truck
and we haul our asses

866
01:03:14,158 --> 01:03:15,957
Out of here

867
01:03:18,861 --> 01:03:20,529

01:04:15,552 --> 01:04:17,853
I mean, where--
where are we gonna go?

873
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:20,889
Baby, I--

874
01:04:20,891 --> 01:04:23,191
I'm sick.

875
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:26,228
- Heidi and I--
- you're fine.

876
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:29,331
Heidi's fine.

877
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:31,366
Tell me something.

878
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:35,136
How the hell did heidi
get down in that hole?

879
01:04:35,138 --> 01:04:37,539
Even if she could move
that slab, which she can't,

880
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:40,609
It's a 25-foot drop
after that.

881
01:04:40,611 --> 01:04:42,043
She didn't have
a scratch on her.

882
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:44,980
Did you ever think
that maybe joyce is right?

883
01:04:44,982 --> 01:04:47,015
Crazy joyce.

884
01:04:47,017 --> 01:04:49,184
That this isn't some kind
of disease, but,

885
01:04:49,186 --> 01:04:53,288
I don't know,
it's... A gift?

886
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:55,957
A gift?

887
01:04:55,959 --> 01:04:58,560
You try seeing what I've seen
and you call it a gift.

888
01:04:58,562 --> 01:05:00,195
I'm just saying
maybe it is.

889
01:05:00,197 --> 01:05:02,964
<i>And I'm done letting you</i>

<i>That she's sick.</i>

891
01:05:04,968 --> 01:05:07,035
That she's got
some mental disorder.

892
01:05:07,037 --> 01:05:09,137
- I--
- I love you. I do.

01:05:09,139 --> 01:05:11,673

894
01:05:11,675 --> 01:05:14,242
- I won't...
- ( gasps )

895
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:18,079

You understand me?

01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:21,082
- I won't do it.
- Andy, please.

897
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:25,287
Look, I have seen enough
to know that it ain't up here.

It's out there.

And maybe it's trying
to tell us something.

900
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:34,429
Maybe you should
try listening.

It's sure gonna be lonely

No, sweetie,

Now it's not
'cause of you.
