1
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,780
Look Bequer, I bought this hat in Paris.

2
00:00:13,088 --> 00:00:16,210
It´s been many years.

3
00:00:16,797 --> 00:00:21,313
It´s a very elegant design.
Don´t you like it?

4
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,174
You don´t understand a thing
about fashion, Bequer.

5
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,817
What a pity, Bequer...
There´s no way to stop this plague.

6
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:28,836
Look my flowers...
Remind me to put the insecticide tomorrow.

7
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,136
Blacker than the night

8
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:13,030
Come and drink your milk.

9
00:02:15,018 --> 00:02:18,917
Bequer, where have you been all day long?

10
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:24,581
If you don´t come when I call you,
there´ll not be any snack for you.

11
00:02:24,926 --> 00:02:27,054
Do you understand?

12
00:03:20,215 --> 00:03:25,838
Bequer,
don´t be such a naughty cat.

13
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:28,208
Behave yourself.

14
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:49,901
- Hi. When did you arrive?
- Just now. Who´s that in my bedroom?

15
00:05:49,769 --> 00:05:53,634
- What?
- Oh, forget it.

16
00:06:00,285 --> 00:06:04,408
Hey you lazy, get up.
It´s too late.

17
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,920
- What a surprise!
- No. You gave me a surprise.

18
00:06:15,948 --> 00:06:18,627
Can you tell me who´s sleeping in my bed?

19
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:22,871
She´s a cousin of mine,
poor girl she didn´t have a place to stay.

20
00:06:22,951 --> 00:06:28,550
- I don´t know what´s happening to men. She´s going to stay?
- If you don´t have any problem...

21
00:06:28,942 --> 00:06:34,034
- Where is she going to sleep?
- Any place, on the sofa or here with me.

22
00:06:34,585 --> 00:06:42,315
- Besides, she can help us with the bills. She´s model.
- That argument convinces me. Come on, get dress, let´s go!

23
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:51,400
Everything was ok with Octavio until yesterday
when I opened the door and I saw...

24
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,017
- A woman!
- Two! His wife and daughter.

25
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:59,546
- What surprise may he had!
- Just figure, he had just his slip on!

26
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:05,498
- What happened?
- I don´t know. I just grabbed my things, acted naïve and left.

27
00:07:05,912 --> 00:07:09,330
- Did they give you any recommendation card?
- Not even a single one.

28
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,954
And I didn´t do it so badly.

29
00:07:12,446 --> 00:07:17,429
Well, just forget it. What´s important is you already
have a place to sleep. Ofelia agrees.

30
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:22,181
- I really don´t know how to thank you...
- Don´t worry, we´ll charge you every forthcoming.

31
00:07:22,181 --> 00:07:27,610
The rules of the house are:
The first one who enter to work has the right to use the bathroom.

32
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,418
I´m late.

33
00:07:30,356 --> 00:07:32,944
- See you later. Bye!
- Bye!

34
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:37,170
By the way, Ofelia.
You didn´t tell us anything about your trip.

35
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:40,090
The bad news are that it´s over now
and I have no plans.

36
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:43,003
- Ofelia, you´re an actress?
- Well, it´s supposed...

37
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:46,103
- What do you do?
- I work as divorcée.

38
00:07:46,103 --> 00:07:49,822
As vampire, she lives with money
stolen from his ex-husband.

39
00:07:49,825 --> 00:07:53,088
Here, I´m the one in charge of
the administration of the house.

40
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:56,825
If that´s the case, bring me
another cup of coffee and put it on my check.

41
00:08:10,237 --> 00:08:12,351
Hi. What are you doing here?

42
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,632
I need to talk with you,
come with me.

43
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:23,377
- Something wrong happened?
- I´m not sure yet.

44
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,077
Look what they sent me.

45
00:08:30,047 --> 00:08:32,852
It´s a solicitor´s citation.

46
00:08:34,202 --> 00:08:38,640
- You just´ve to go and find yourself.
- I want you come with me, this things scare me.

47
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,420
I´m scared too.

48
00:08:40,434 --> 00:08:49,023
The house and all it properties, will keep after my death
in charge of my niece Miss Ofelia Escudero.

49
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:52,488
- An inheritance?
- A considerably sum of money.

50
00:08:52,707 --> 00:08:58,271
It´s an old house but has a lot
of land and many valuable objects.

51
00:08:58,922 --> 00:09:03,542
But... I can´t understand why
aunt Susana chosed me.

52
00:09:03,828 --> 00:09:09,065
- I´m aware that you were the only family she had.
- So, it was by default.

53
00:09:09,065 --> 00:09:13,436
Oh, it doesn´t matter!
What´s important is you inherited, like in a soap opera!

54
00:09:13,456 --> 00:09:17,010
One moment. This things always get
weird with strange terms and conditions.

55
00:09:17,087 --> 00:09:22,315
- Like marying someone you don´t know or adopting a child.
- Well, that´s half true.

56
00:09:22,369 --> 00:09:29,684
- See? I told you... - It´s not as serious as you think,
it´s not even a condition but a beg.

57
00:09:32,006 --> 00:09:37,457
As an exchange for this legacy,
I just wait from my niece´s humanitarian feelings...

58
00:09:37,516 --> 00:09:41,338
... to accept the custody of the living being
I loved the most in my life...

59
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:47,455
...and kept me faithfull company for many years, my unforgettable cat Bequer.

60
00:09:47,455 --> 00:09:49,644
A cat?!

61
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:54,516
As an exchange of a house,
I can´t see the problem.

62
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:58,780
- Who´s this aunt Susana?
- She was my mother´s cousin.

63
00:09:58,994 --> 00:10:03,627
I barely remember her.
I was afraid of her, she always scolded to me.

64
00:10:03,954 --> 00:10:09,036
- Then, there was a family fight and I never saw her again.
- You don´t remember anything about the house?

65
00:10:10,128 --> 00:10:14,441
Yes.
There was a big chandelier in the saloon.

66
00:10:18,104 --> 00:10:23,460
And long stairways.
I slid down the handrail when I was a child.

67
00:10:24,351 --> 00:10:27,136
There was a big clock somewhere.

68
00:10:27,402 --> 00:10:30,494
I loved hearing the clock´s strokes.

69
00:10:31,955 --> 00:10:36,004
The entire house had a strange
damp and spikenard´s smell.

70
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,557
And it was always silent.

71
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:48,406
What impressed me the most,
was aunt Susana´s portrait on the saloon.

72
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:55,067
- Not very modern, isn´t it?
- No, but it must have many bedrooms.

73
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:06,054
- That means servants, isn´t it?
- Why not? With the money we saved, we can pay for them.

74
00:11:15,763 --> 00:11:17,164
Good afternoon.

75
00:11:18,936 --> 00:11:20,774
I´m Ofelia Escudero.

76
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:25,773
- I´m not sure if you know that...
- I know.

77
00:11:26,825 --> 00:11:28,288
Come in.

78
00:11:36,903 --> 00:11:40,936
- These are my friends, they´ll live with me.
- Like you wish.

79
00:11:41,015 --> 00:11:44,850
- We´d like to see the entire house.
- My pleasure.

80
00:11:45,502 --> 00:11:48,164
This is the main saloon.

81
00:11:48,698 --> 00:11:51,220
That´s the reception room.

82
00:12:07,835 --> 00:12:09,977
That´s the famous picture?

83
00:12:11,672 --> 00:12:18,973
- What a cool aunt!
- She was a very distinguished lady, if that´s what you mean.

84
00:12:19,102 --> 00:12:20,921
Yes, that´s it.

85
00:12:23,312 --> 00:12:28,286
- So many weirds things!
- Did you see this eyesore?

86
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:35,294
That eyesore was a present from
the Persian´s ambassador to Madam Susana.

87
00:12:35,461 --> 00:12:42,609
- I was just saying it´s weird.
- Don´t worry Miss. I understand your point of view.

88
00:12:43,099 --> 00:12:47,946
Modernism, has distorted people´s taste.

89
00:12:48,994 --> 00:12:53,299
- Do you want to see the living room?
- Why don´t we check the bedrooms?

90
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:54,845
Yes, much better.

91
00:12:56,845 --> 00:13:00,259
Do you want to know when I´ll go the Persia?
Never!

92
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:29,585
This is your aunt´s bedroom,
where she died.

93
00:13:29,653 --> 00:13:33,537
The notary told me she died of a heart attack
while she was kitting in the saloon.

94
00:13:33,537 --> 00:13:38,213
That´s true but she was still alive
when we brought here.

95
00:14:02,306 --> 00:14:05,616
Everything is exactly as it was
before she dies.

96
00:14:07,057 --> 00:14:12,124
- What´s in the box?
- Your aunt´s ring, the one she always used it.

97
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:19,889
Put it on.

98
00:14:21,246 --> 00:14:22,659
No.

99
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:29,965
- We should keep this room closed
out of consideration for your aunt. - Yes, I think that´s ok.

100
00:14:30,146 --> 00:14:33,667
What?!
And waste this bed?!

101
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,891
She died here.

102
00:14:36,989 --> 00:14:40,257
- Then, she died very comfortable.
- Why don´t you keep this bedroom?

103
00:14:40,983 --> 00:14:47,234
- I´d love that but Ofelia is her niece and she should stay.
- No, it´s yours if you really liked it.

104
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:50,955
If you want to,
you can check the other bedrooms.

105
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,161
This junk is quite comfortable.

106
00:15:05,444 --> 00:15:13,049
- Did you see this? A collection of junk!
- Watch out, it can be from the Turkish ambassador.

107
00:15:13,502 --> 00:15:16,156
- Did they scold you, huh?
- Lousy broad...

108
00:15:16,164 --> 00:15:20,178
Girls, I found an incredible treasure up there.

109
00:15:20,225 --> 00:15:23,282
The bathrooms are full of white clothes
and towels.

110
00:15:23,587 --> 00:15:29,085
- We´ve inherited many things.
- I want to know if we´re going to keep that horrible servant.

111
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:32,862
Be careful cocky girl, the mummy can hear you.

112
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:37,549
Did you see the kitchen?
What a fancy oven!

113
00:15:37,554 --> 00:15:41,326
- I´m going right now, that´s my especiality!
- Wait a moment, something important is missing.

114
00:15:41,496 --> 00:15:44,669
- Where´s Bequer?
- Of course, the cat!

115
00:15:44,714 --> 00:15:48,211
I have no idea where it can be.

116
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:54,811
Since your aunt´s death,
it acts very strange and it´s usually hidden somewhere.

117
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:00,694
Well, I don´t care.
I hate cats in general.

118
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:04,343
Tell me something, Sofia...
Is it pretty?

119
00:16:05,118 --> 00:16:10,516
Your aunt said that it wasn´t
anything better in the world.

120
00:16:10,665 --> 00:16:12,553
What colour is it?

121
00:16:13,185 --> 00:16:17,424
Black, blacker than night.

122
00:16:17,748 --> 00:16:19,601
Blacker than night...

123
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:26,280
- Corny old woman. All this solemnity just for a lousy cat.
- Don´t complain, thanks to it you have this house.

124
00:16:26,295 --> 00:16:31,546
Oh! Listen to the prince consort.
You´re going to defend that cat just to please Ofelia.

125
00:16:31,684 --> 00:16:33,595
And I like it a lot.

126
00:16:33,684 --> 00:16:36,640
The problem is you suffer from urophobia.

127
00:16:36,892 --> 00:16:38,324
What?!

128
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:43,344
Urophobia. Uro is urine, phobia is fear.
Fear of the cats.

129
00:16:44,276 --> 00:16:47,903
If that´s the case, we´re two.
I hate cats.

130
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:51,509
Except for the husband,
there isn´t any other ungrateful animal.

131
00:16:51,785 --> 00:16:54,845
- What are you doing?
- Saving me the stairs.

132
00:16:54,845 --> 00:16:56,963
Martha is downstairs waiting...

133
00:16:57,733 --> 00:17:00,061
What happened?
I get tired of waiting.

134
00:17:01,275 --> 00:17:05,080
She´s a weirdo! Everything is in the car now.
Even a needle won´t fit.

135
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,720
- I´ll have to do another trip.
- Take this, there´s a place in the seat.

136
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,255
Don´t touch it!
How you dare to put your hands on my canary?

137
00:17:13,255 --> 00:17:17,619
- Oh c´mon, it won´t die!
- Yes, it can. Look, now it´s trembling.

138
00:17:17,629 --> 00:17:21,392
Did the witch scare you?
Come with mommy.

139
00:17:23,273 --> 00:17:26,563
This is cornier than
Christmas with the family.

140
00:17:30,153 --> 00:17:31,837
Isn´t he lovely?

141
00:17:32,062 --> 00:17:35,834
Yes, I hope Bequer get
both of you married.

142
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:40,852
You may not believe it but
Bequer´s absence have me worried.

143
00:17:40,862 --> 00:17:45,055
- I hope it gets permanently lost.
- Don´t say that, they´ll take out our inheritance.

144
00:17:45,071 --> 00:17:49,546
The testament didn´t say that.
But I feel morally responsible.

145
00:17:49,665 --> 00:17:53,920
Ofelia... what if instead of living in this museum,
you sell it.

146
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:58,935
- Cool! You could buy a condominium!
- And lose this? Never.

147
00:17:59,171 --> 00:18:03,625
In the future, when there´s more money
I could throw it and start a modern house.

148
00:18:03,761 --> 00:18:07,775
I leave you with your engaging projects,
I go to sleep.

149
00:18:07,915 --> 00:18:12,532
- Me too. I carried boxes like a longshoreman.
- Ok, session´s over.

150
00:18:14,415 --> 00:18:19,119
- Hey, the testament force you to keep the mummy?
- No, but what can I do?

151
00:18:19,394 --> 00:18:21,031
Embalm her!

152
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:30,952
- Curtains will look nice up there.
- Still awake, Sofia?

153
00:18:33,885 --> 00:18:39,416
I have the habit of turn off the lights
and wound up the clocks every night.

154
00:18:39,663 --> 00:18:44,319
- You´ll tell me if you want I keep doing it.
- No, no... It´s ok.

155
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:47,912
Good night.

156
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:57,833
- Sofia, did Bequer shows up?
- Don´t worry Miss. The cat´ll come back.

157
00:19:08,277 --> 00:19:11,276
I think this moving,
it´s going to complicate yourself.

158
00:19:11,826 --> 00:19:17,095
Because of Roberto?
I´ll phone his office tomorrow to tell him where I´m living.

159
00:19:17,303 --> 00:19:21,180
- For a divorced couple, you´ve a quite good relationship.
- Not at all, my dear.

160
00:19:21,246 --> 00:19:24,115
I´m interested in him sending my money.

161
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:29,106
- Admit it, you still want him.
- Yes, in the bottom of the sea with a stone on his neck.

162
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:34,735
If I were you, I´d patch things up.
You´re complicating life with stupidities.

163
00:19:37,923 --> 00:19:39,286
What´s wrong?

164
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,956
I don´t know,
something strange in the air.

165
00:19:43,445 --> 00:19:48,176
- Don´t you notice?
- I feel a spikenard´s smell.

166
00:19:49,457 --> 00:19:52,374
It wasn´t so intense in the morning.

167
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:56,288
Don´t start with your imagination `cause
you won´t be sleeping.

168
00:19:57,213 --> 00:19:59,025
Can you turn off the lights?

169
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,055
Good night.

170
00:20:25,884 --> 00:20:27,721
Good night, Madam.

171
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,150
- Did you hear that?! - Who screamed?!
- Pilar!

172
00:21:26,372 --> 00:21:27,910
Oh...it´s Bequer!

173
00:21:28,332 --> 00:21:30,381
That´s why you screamed?

174
00:21:31,143 --> 00:21:34,491
It scared the shit out of me!
Damn cat!

175
00:21:34,758 --> 00:21:36,607
Be careful, it can scratch you.

176
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:40,626
- It´s scared.
- And with a good reason, he found Pilar in the dark.

177
00:21:40,683 --> 00:21:42,291
Very amusing.

178
00:21:43,324 --> 00:21:47,389
- Something´s happening?
- Yes, this indecent cat entered to the room!

179
00:21:47,481 --> 00:21:50,410
It still feel this is her master´s bedroom.

180
00:21:50,426 --> 00:21:53,468
It has always slept in that rocking chair.

181
00:21:53,717 --> 00:21:57,300
- From where it came in?
- From the window. It´s open.

182
00:21:57,713 --> 00:22:03,381
Madam Susana ordered to take off
the grills for Bequer wander around freely.

183
00:22:03,413 --> 00:22:05,481
I´ll fix that tomorrow.

184
00:22:05,566 --> 00:22:10,283
- I´m not going to sleep every night with a cat!
- Not every night but tonight you don´t have choice..

185
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:14,983
Will see...
Get out of here! Get out!

186
00:22:16,411 --> 00:22:22,617
I don´t recommend you do that.
It´d spend all night meowing at the door.

187
00:22:22,691 --> 00:22:26,463
She´s right.
Forget about the cat, lie down and get to sleep.

188
00:22:26,467 --> 00:22:31,531
- It won´t be easy but...anyhow.
- Let ourselves sleep. - Please.

189
00:22:38,871 --> 00:22:43,266
- Good morning! - Good morning!
- Enjoying yourselves, huh?

190
00:22:43,665 --> 00:22:50,038
- You were sleeping like a log and I didn´t want to wake you up.
- With last night´s little party I could hardly sleep.

191
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,420
Think what you want but
I´m happy we found Bequer.

192
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:59,143
- I don´t think it´s funny.
- Me, for instance, I won´t sleep in that bedroom anymore.

193
00:22:59,355 --> 00:23:02,258
Ok, I take it.
We´ll change places later.

194
00:23:02,566 --> 00:23:06,227
- Now I want some company to go through the cellars.
- They´re cellars?

195
00:23:06,237 --> 00:23:12,054
- Huge and apparently full of old junk.
- I love seeing pieces of junk!

196
00:23:12,206 --> 00:23:16,405
- Whereabouts is the entry?
- There´s a door at the back of the house.

197
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,148
Sofia gave me the keys.

198
00:23:23,699 --> 00:23:25,135
Did you see this?

199
00:23:26,482 --> 00:23:29,980
I can´t understand how could they
dress like this in the streets.

200
00:23:31,694 --> 00:23:36,638
- I can´t understand how could they cover their bodies so much.
- Being virtuous was meaningless. Where´s the joke about it?

201
00:23:36,699 --> 00:23:40,298
Sure.
Just imagine to undress one´s clothes!

202
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:46,809
- This fashion suits you very well, Pilar.
- I guess it´s the habit.

203
00:23:46,895 --> 00:23:50,022
These dresses are just like
the ones my husband bought me.

204
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:53,682
Hey, your aunt sure knew about business.
Check this!

205
00:23:53,701 --> 00:24:00,663
- That´s why your aunt didn´t get married? - She didn´t want to.
She had a romantic story waiting for his first boyfriend.

206
00:24:01,445 --> 00:24:04,253
She has never wore that coat?
What a waste!

207
00:24:05,596 --> 00:24:08,485
Will you dare to go out dressed like that?

208
00:24:08,526 --> 00:24:11,280
Yes, some tuesday´s carnival.
Why not?

209
00:24:11,346 --> 00:24:18,245
- That´d be cool! We can do a masquerade party!
- Pilar and Sofia should go without mask.

210
00:24:18,851 --> 00:24:22,803
- Shut up! Those are malicious words.

211
00:24:29,575 --> 00:24:33,813
Hey, that´d be for the front page
or just for the cancan?

212
00:24:38,706 --> 00:24:43,229
- I think this is Lucía´s sunday dress.
- No, hers are more cheerful.

213
00:24:43,512 --> 00:24:47,868
- You look like my grandmother with that hat!
- Yes but the way she´s now in the grave!

214
00:24:57,605 --> 00:25:00,301
Girls, look what I found!

215
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:07,138
- I´m sure something especial is in there.
- I´ll find out.

216
00:25:09,455 --> 00:25:15,582
- Damn cat! It scared me a lot!
- Bequer, get out of here. Don´t be a nuisance.

217
00:25:15,837 --> 00:25:17,653
Get out!

218
00:25:18,012 --> 00:25:22,530
- Be careful, it´s furious!
- Like if that box were itself´s. - It´ll pay for this!

219
00:25:22,774 --> 00:25:25,970
- Please don´t hit it!
- Of course I´ll! - It´s leaving now.

220
00:25:26,255 --> 00:25:29,974
Quite friendly cat, huh?
Did it hurt you?

221
00:25:30,031 --> 00:25:31,987
Nah, it just took it to heart.

222
00:25:33,027 --> 00:25:35,497
- Let´s see what´s in that box, ok?
- Ok.

223
00:25:45,775 --> 00:25:49,662
- What a gorgeous dress!
- It must be my aun´t wedding dress.

224
00:25:49,695 --> 00:25:53,906
- Didn´t you tell us she wasn´t married?
- Yeah but it seems she had it prepared.

225
00:25:54,409 --> 00:25:58,077
Maybe you can fix it and
wear it in your wedding.

226
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:03,367
That´s true.
It´ll cost me a lot to buy a dress like this.

227
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:06,315
They say wearing something old
is good luck!

228
00:26:06,425 --> 00:26:09,194
That´d be done if you show up
as the maid of honor.

229
00:26:09,456 --> 00:26:12,807
- I´ll go to my room and try on!
- Come on!

230
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,443
Bequer.

231
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,475
Bequer, what are you doing here?

232
00:26:53,882 --> 00:27:00,598
Come here, my dear.
Stop playing pranks. Come here.

233
00:27:05,155 --> 00:27:07,709
Can we listen something more quiet?

234
00:27:07,772 --> 00:27:13,396
- No, that´s why I brought my records. Do you prefer those from the aunt? - Did she own?
- Of course she owned!

235
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:21,923
Bach, Chopin, Bethoveen, Wagner´s opera,
Vivaldi. She was totally out.

236
00:27:21,925 --> 00:27:27,343
- I´m thinking on keeping the dress the way it is now.
It´s ok? - I think is great.

237
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:30,267
- Did you like the idea of her wearing that dress?
- Of course.

238
00:27:30,267 --> 00:27:33,534
Of course, he saves himself
buying a new one.

239
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:37,581
Did she see you with your dress on?
That´s bad luck.

240
00:27:37,878 --> 00:27:43,465
It also means being one step ahead of the wedding.
We don´t like that, little boy. These two mothers in law are watching you.

241
00:28:37,328 --> 00:28:38,866
Bequer!

242
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:39,027
Come here, Bequer!

243
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:53,206
Someone´s in the garden.

244
00:29:55,332 --> 00:29:59,388
- What are you talking about?
- Someone´s calling Bequer from the garden!

245
00:29:59,538 --> 00:30:03,508
- Did you see something?
- Yes, looked like the shadow of a woman.

246
00:30:05,057 --> 00:30:11,368
- Watch out, people. Aurora loves making jokes.
- No! I swear it´s not a joke, I heard a voice in the garden!

247
00:30:11,538 --> 00:30:14,498
- I want to be sure about this.
- I go with you.

248
00:30:16,228 --> 00:30:18,410
You´d better not joking about this.

249
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:21,094
No, I swear I´m not!

250
00:30:35,847 --> 00:30:37,462
Nobody´s here.

251
00:30:38,281 --> 00:30:42,222
- I already knew that.
- Let´s go back, it´s very cold.

252
00:30:43,513 --> 00:30:48,536
This is the first time they leave us alone.
I´m not going to waste this opportunity.

253
00:30:52,529 --> 00:30:53,930
Did you hear that?

254
00:30:54,164 --> 00:30:56,631
Yes and very close.

255
00:30:59,554 --> 00:31:04,525
- Wait here. - Don´t go. It´s Sofia.
I don´t know why I didn´t think of that before.

256
00:31:04,938 --> 00:31:08,477
Thank goodness...
I was getting the chill down my spine.

257
00:31:12,498 --> 00:31:16,125
No, no Miss. It wasn´t me.

258
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:20,363
- I´ve been in the kitchen all night.
- But we heard you, Sofia!

259
00:31:20,367 --> 00:31:26,265
I assure you. You´re wrong.
Besides, there´s any reason to call Bequer.

260
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:29,833
It always stay in the garden during the night.

261
00:31:30,093 --> 00:31:33,659
Unless we´d called it earlier because
the clouds looked threatening.

262
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:36,679
Rain?
In this season?

263
00:31:36,881 --> 00:31:42,311
I´m just giving a report
of this house´s custom.

264
00:31:42,688 --> 00:31:44,391
Ok, you can go now.

265
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,671
With your permission.

266
00:31:53,846 --> 00:31:55,850
I´m sure it was her!

267
00:31:56,157 --> 00:32:01,642
- Crazy old woman, I can´t stand her!
- The good part is we´re in good company.

268
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:07,144
She´s right about one thing:
There´s a lot of noise in this house!

269
00:32:07,144 --> 00:32:10,877
Oh, you didn´t hear nothing yet!
Let´s dance, Pedro!

270
00:32:15,761 --> 00:32:18,955
I don´t understand why she
said she wasn´t in the garden.

271
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:24,155
- You know...? I´m not so sure if she was that voice.
- Who else´d be? - I don´t know.

272
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,808
I´m not superstitious but...

273
00:32:27,047 --> 00:32:30,678
... it frightened me a lot
when I heard that voice.

274
00:32:35,449 --> 00:32:38,442
Can you believe this?
It´s raining.

275
00:33:56,929 --> 00:33:58,504
Who´s there?

276
00:34:30,204 --> 00:34:31,750
Who´s there?

277
00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:05,710
Of course it was her!
Neither of us could do it.

278
00:35:05,881 --> 00:35:09,098
I can´t believe it.
How this woman dare to enter in my bedroom?

279
00:35:09,171 --> 00:35:15,076
Believe it. This old servants feel they´ve the right to do it.
The fact that they see us as intruders...

280
00:35:15,255 --> 00:35:18,502
- Did you want it to see me, Miss?
- Yes, Sofía.

281
00:35:22,527 --> 00:35:26,241
Tell me...
What did you burn there, last night?

282
00:35:27,945 --> 00:35:31,811
- Me?
- Look Sofia, I want you tell me the truth.

283
00:35:31,923 --> 00:35:38,181
Yesterday, I found a wedding dress in the cellar.
Someone took away from my room and threw it in the fire.

284
00:35:38,181 --> 00:35:42,292
- Your aunt´s wedding dress?
- Yes, that one.

285
00:35:50,052 --> 00:35:51,698
I burned myself.

286
00:35:51,771 --> 00:35:55,363
That´s inexcusable!
How did you dare!

287
00:35:56,403 --> 00:36:00,064
Your aunt adored that dress.

288
00:36:00,498 --> 00:36:03,614
It was something very beautiful for her.

289
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:12,556
I don´t think you´ve had such love for an object
to the extent of treat it as something untouchable...

290
00:36:13,136 --> 00:36:17,370
... and sacred.
- That didn´t give you the right...! - Of course not, Miss.

291
00:36:17,799 --> 00:36:20,135
I beg you to forgive me.

292
00:36:20,584 --> 00:36:25,054
- If you want I can leave...
- That´s not the point, Sofía.

293
00:36:26,843 --> 00:36:28,390
We´ll talk later.

294
00:36:29,014 --> 00:36:30,558
With your permission.

295
00:36:35,209 --> 00:36:37,290
Why didn´t you fire her?

296
00:36:37,554 --> 00:36:41,000
I´m not sure.
Poor woman, she really loved my aunt.

297
00:36:41,012 --> 00:36:45,329
She´s an hypocrite!
Did you see her innocence face when you asked her?

298
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:48,445
She almost convinced me.

299
00:36:48,659 --> 00:36:51,505
- But who else could be?
- Of course.

300
00:36:52,299 --> 00:36:57,397
But...
How did she know that the dress was in my bedroom?

301
00:36:59,587 --> 00:37:01,654
He looked so handsome!

302
00:37:41,848 --> 00:37:43,419
Bequer!

303
00:37:43,891 --> 00:37:45,457
Yes!

304
00:37:49,706 --> 00:37:52,836
That damn cat did it...

305
00:38:02,415 --> 00:38:04,920
Bye darling, thanks for everything.

306
00:38:05,327 --> 00:38:06,865
Can we have lunch tomorrow?

307
00:38:06,865 --> 00:38:12,174
- I don´t think so. I call you at the office.
- Ok, bye. - Bye.

308
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,963
Let me close for you.

309
00:38:45,254 --> 00:38:47,307
Bequer, where are you?

310
00:38:55,152 --> 00:38:56,501
Who´s there?

311
00:38:59,048 --> 00:39:00,973
It´s me, Miss.

312
00:39:04,148 --> 00:39:06,064
I´m looking for Bequer.

313
00:39:06,207 --> 00:39:11,389
I didn´t see it all day long.
It didn´t eat and that worries me.

314
00:39:11,547 --> 00:39:16,560
- Don´t worry, it´ll come back.
- No. It won´t if I don´t call it.

315
00:39:16,702 --> 00:39:19,856
- It´s scared.
- Why?

316
00:39:21,956 --> 00:39:24,799
Bequer knows when it behaved badly.

317
00:39:25,297 --> 00:39:27,559
Today, it made something terrible.

318
00:39:27,803 --> 00:39:30,970
It killed Miss Aurora´s canary.

319
00:39:33,787 --> 00:39:35,749
Poor little darling...

320
00:41:22,124 --> 00:41:24,928
Marta! Wake up!

321
00:41:25,539 --> 00:41:27,202
What happens?

322
00:41:28,954 --> 00:41:30,656
Listen...

323
00:41:36,351 --> 00:41:38,406
I don´t hear anything.

324
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:45,916
Already stopped.

325
00:41:49,978 --> 00:41:55,437
- What happens, Aurora? You´re trembling.
- Marta, those sobbing were horrible.

326
00:41:56,435 --> 00:41:59,707
- C´mon woman, you just had a nightmare.
- No.

327
00:42:00,499 --> 00:42:03,423
I heard ´em, I was awake!

328
00:42:04,526 --> 00:42:07,392
Then... I went to the corridor and...

329
00:42:08,973 --> 00:42:11,448
Someone´s was crying in the saloon.

330
00:42:12,946 --> 00:42:15,604
- We can go see if you want to.
- No!

331
00:42:19,697 --> 00:42:22,166
No matter what, I won´t go downstairs.

332
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,517
I´m so scared!

333
00:42:37,377 --> 00:42:39,630
So scared...

334
00:42:45,161 --> 00:42:47,214
- Good morning, Sofía.
- Good morning.

335
00:42:48,421 --> 00:42:49,886
Sofía...

336
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:55,369
Did you hear something weird last night?

337
00:42:55,467 --> 00:43:00,763
- Weird? Like what?
- Like a crying.

338
00:43:02,274 --> 00:43:03,881
A crying?

339
00:43:04,361 --> 00:43:07,297
No. I didn´t hear a thing.

340
00:43:07,971 --> 00:43:09,896
Thank you, Sofía.

341
00:43:10,008 --> 00:43:13,828
- I´m sure it was the sound of the wind, Aurora.
- No, not at all.

342
00:43:14,045 --> 00:43:18,365
- What I listened was a crying.
- But Pilar and Ofelia didn´t hear anything.

343
00:43:18,572 --> 00:43:22,582
Yes, that´s very strange.

344
00:43:22,969 --> 00:43:25,135
Why only me?

345
00:43:45,148 --> 00:43:47,976
You better give up, I´m on fire tonight.

346
00:43:49,008 --> 00:43:50,881
Ok, I give up.

347
00:43:51,566 --> 00:43:56,140
- You´re not happy. What´s wrong?
- You´ll make fun of me if I tell you.

348
00:43:56,836 --> 00:43:58,600
- Bequer.
- Yes.

349
00:43:59,466 --> 00:44:03,699
It didn´t come back, not even for eating.
It´s been 4 days now.

350
00:44:03,919 --> 00:44:10,740
- I think we definitively lose it.
- Don´t worry. It must be out there living a passionate romance.

351
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:31,238
How wonderful animals are...
He had a feeling he´ll be scold after killing the canary.

352
00:44:31,412 --> 00:44:34,920
- It´d do any good if I get a new cat for you?
- No.

353
00:44:35,393 --> 00:44:40,199
- I´ve became very fond of it. He was very pretty.
- And blacker than night!

354
00:44:40,221 --> 00:44:43,770
- Don´t make fun of it.
- No, I´m truly sorry.

355
00:44:44,388 --> 00:44:47,716
- Do you want to come in?
- Do you want?

356
00:44:55,315 --> 00:44:56,522
I´m coming in!

357
00:44:58,053 --> 00:45:01,805
Sofia´s bedroom is at the back
of the garden but I...

358
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:09,634
- What´s happening?
- We must tell you something. You ain´t going to like it.

359
00:45:09,919 --> 00:45:11,262
What?

360
00:45:11,765 --> 00:45:17,368
- We found Bequer.
- Oh, I was scared! Where is it?

361
00:45:20,745 --> 00:45:22,431
In the cellar...

362
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:24,391
Dead.

363
00:45:29,798 --> 00:45:31,907
How could this happen?

364
00:45:32,242 --> 00:45:34,779
We didn´t notice and we let it locked.

365
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:38,240
It couldn´t get out
because of the barred windows.

366
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,877
It died of hunger.

367
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:43,225
Poor thing...

368
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:47,990
Don´t get distress about it.
I know it´s sad but it´s nobody´s fault.

369
00:45:48,004 --> 00:45:50,766
It´s urgent we take the cat out
and throw it far from here.

370
00:45:50,766 --> 00:45:55,175
Throw it? Certainly not!
We´ll buried it in the garden.

371
00:45:55,189 --> 00:45:59,815
- Ofelia, that´s nonsense!
- I don´t care! I´d feel very bad if I didn´t do it.

372
00:45:59,931 --> 00:46:02,281
We never treat it respectfully.

373
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:07,556
Ok. If that calm you down,
we´ll buried it tomorrow.

374
00:46:08,191 --> 00:46:09,924
I feel so guilty.

375
00:46:10,547 --> 00:46:14,734
- He must´ve suffered a lot.
- Don´t think about that. Let´s go.

376
00:46:20,153 --> 00:46:24,687
Ok. Fortunately, Bequer´s problem is finished.

377
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:29,662
Damn cat!
Not even dead I´ll forgive it about my canary.

378
00:46:32,202 --> 00:46:34,692
Let´s go, Marta.
What are you doing?

379
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:40,924
Nothing.
I´m thinking what aunt Susana´d do if she knew it.

380
00:47:42,541 --> 00:47:44,085
Who is it?

381
00:47:48,179 --> 00:47:49,565
Who´s there?

382
00:48:17,247 --> 00:48:19,833
What can I do for you, Miss?

383
00:48:23,328 --> 00:48:28,368
- How did you dare to bring this here?
- Bring what?

384
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,258
This!

385
00:48:32,699 --> 00:48:34,673
Don´t try to deny it!

386
00:48:37,673 --> 00:48:44,822
- It seems cruel to leave it in the cellar,
this was Bequer´s favourite spot. - You must be crazy!

387
00:48:46,448 --> 00:48:52,719
- Just for this night.
- Take out this junk right now! Do you understand?

388
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:56,599
Yes. Yes, Miss...

389
00:49:57,933 --> 00:50:00,067
Done. Something else?

390
00:50:00,616 --> 00:50:03,361
I suppose you´re not expecting
we put a gravestone, right?

391
00:50:03,361 --> 00:50:12,785
- Don´t make fun of me. I couldn´t just throw it in a trash can.
- Ok, we already did it. Now, please forget about Bequer.

392
00:50:13,653 --> 00:50:20,098
- I´m very sorry, Sofía. I didn´t take proper care of Bequer.
- The house´ll be very different now.

393
00:50:20,305 --> 00:50:23,054
Personally,
I won´t notice the difference.

394
00:50:24,184 --> 00:50:27,670
I assure you, you´ll notice Miss.

395
00:50:32,716 --> 00:50:34,743
Why did you give her explanations?

396
00:50:35,026 --> 00:50:41,849
- She loved Bequer. I don´t want she hold a grudge against us.
- Hold a grudge? She hates us.

397
00:50:43,179 --> 00:50:45,199
The way she looks at us.

398
00:50:51,479 --> 00:50:57,247
- Does that utter nonsense ended?
- Let me tell you, my dear, that you don´t have any feelings.

399
00:50:57,247 --> 00:51:02,247
You´re a bunch of hypocrites!
You´re as happy as me with the cat´s dead.

400
00:51:02,248 --> 00:51:05,210
You are just making a good impression on Ofelia.

401
00:51:06,861 --> 00:51:13,482
- I can´t understand how no one listened it miaowing?
- Yes, it´s weird that a cat die of hunger so quietly.

402
00:51:13,684 --> 00:51:19,171
Enough!!! I´m fed up with the cat!
You´re going to drive me crazy!

403
00:51:19,734 --> 00:51:22,917
- There´s no other subject to talk about?
- What´s the problem, Aurora?

404
00:51:23,006 --> 00:51:31,906
I can´t stand this! It´s been a week since you only
talk about Bequer! This is too much!

405
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:41,982
What´s wrong with her?

406
00:51:42,917 --> 00:51:44,494
Bequer.

407
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:48,337
Who is it?

408
00:51:48,386 --> 00:51:50,966
- It´s me, Miss.
- Come in.

409
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:57,060
What´s that?

410
00:51:57,403 --> 00:52:02,026
- As you didn´t eat this afternoon...
- Thanks. Leave it there.

411
00:52:04,646 --> 00:52:06,579
Do you feel sick?

412
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:10,004
Yes, I´m a little bit nervous.

413
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:15,353
Did you hear those voices again?

414
00:52:15,735 --> 00:52:17,026
No.

415
00:52:19,848 --> 00:52:22,292
You must think I´m crazy.

416
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,373
Why?

417
00:52:25,297 --> 00:52:30,183
Because I´m a modern woman liberated of all
those nonsenses...

418
00:52:30,804 --> 00:52:35,197
... and suddenly I´m listening voices at midnight...

419
00:52:37,386 --> 00:52:39,536
...but I heard them, Sofia!

420
00:52:39,925 --> 00:52:46,161
They we terrifying, long and bloodcurding.
Horrible.

421
00:52:46,901 --> 00:52:49,239
If you had listened to them.

422
00:52:52,521 --> 00:52:54,169
I did.

423
00:52:57,377 --> 00:53:01,511
Sofía, help me please. Help me!

424
00:53:01,906 --> 00:53:06,604
You´ve lived in this house for so long,
you know all the noises...

425
00:53:07,395 --> 00:53:14,237
...it has to be an explanation.
- There is one. Do you believe in the afterlife?

426
00:53:16,146 --> 00:53:19,207
No. Of course not.

427
00:53:21,788 --> 00:53:24,682
If so, you wouldn´t understand me.

428
00:53:34,667 --> 00:53:37,671
If you listen to them again...

429
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:40,142
... stay in your room.

430
00:54:05,965 --> 00:54:10,215
- You´re going to stay much longer, Miss Aurora?
- No, José. I´m finishing.

431
00:54:11,779 --> 00:54:14,295
You didn´t read any book, don´t you?

432
00:54:14,317 --> 00:54:19,215
- Why it worries you? You never read them.
- At my age? When I´d finished them?

433
00:54:19,225 --> 00:54:26,422
- It´s not about reading all of them but the important ones.
- Much worst would be reading all of them, just imagine trying all these!

434
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:30,327
- I´m in the office if you need me.
- Thanks, José.

435
00:56:59,195 --> 00:57:01,616
Drink it, Aurora. You´ll feel better.

436
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:10,928
I saw her. It wasn´t my imagination.
Believe me.

437
00:57:10,954 --> 00:57:16,895
- You just said that the caretaker checked the library
and didn´t find anyone. - But she was there!

438
00:57:17,577 --> 00:57:19,409
And then I saw the walking stick.

439
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:25,693
I´m still watching it in my mind.
I didn´t recall about the stick!

440
00:57:25,749 --> 00:57:30,103
Of course you do, you see it
every day in that picture over there.

441
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,347
No, I saw it.
It wasn´t the same.

442
00:57:34,375 --> 00:57:36,371
It was very clear.

443
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:39,358
It´s silver hilt shined.

444
00:57:39,384 --> 00:57:43,565
That stick never was in the library,
I´m going to show you right now.

445
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:47,797
- It´s in the house?
- Naturally.

446
00:57:48,702 --> 00:57:51,782
- It´d make you feel better if you saw it?
- I don´t know.

447
00:57:52,708 --> 00:57:54,114
Maybe.

448
00:57:54,811 --> 00:58:02,385
All is a product of an obsession. Since that night when you
heard the voices, you can´t stop thinking about this.

449
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:13,626
- Tell me, Miss.
- Sofía, can you please bring us my aunt´s walking stick?

450
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:19,823
Don´t look at us that way!

451
00:58:19,946 --> 00:58:27,852
- We want the one she used in her portrait.
- But... that´s not possible.

452
00:58:28,999 --> 00:58:33,642
- She carried with her.
- She carried? How´s that?

453
00:58:35,523 --> 00:58:40,832
The day we buried her,
I put that stick in her coffin.

454
00:58:41,304 --> 00:58:46,114
- What should I put first?
- The sauce first, then the almonds.

455
00:58:47,581 --> 00:58:53,727
- Who taught you this dish?
- My grandmother. It was Madam Susana´s favourite dish.

456
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:57,315
You really loved her, right?

457
00:59:01,702 --> 00:59:04,379
She was a wonderful person.

458
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:08,652
Every person who knew her,
became very fond of her.

459
00:59:09,074 --> 00:59:11,889
However, she never managed
to get along with Ofelia.

460
00:59:12,109 --> 00:59:18,764
She was very strict, Miss.
If someone made a mistake, she never forgot it.

461
00:59:19,221 --> 00:59:21,190
She didn´t know how to forgive.

462
00:59:23,131 --> 00:59:25,173
You rest, Sofía. I go.

463
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:38,024
- You?
- Hi. Can I come in?

464
00:59:38,676 --> 00:59:40,239
Yes, of course.

465
00:59:42,268 --> 00:59:45,638
What message did you gave to the caretaker?
He didn´t explain me very well.

466
00:59:45,717 --> 00:59:51,467
- One of you´ve inherited a house or something...
- Ofelia. This is her house.

467
00:59:53,637 --> 00:59:56,172
You´re planning to stay here with your friends?

468
00:59:56,655 --> 00:59:59,726
I don´t have to tell you about my plans.

469
01:00:00,752 --> 01:00:07,801
Damn! Don´t be so agressive.
It just worries me you live here, as if you didn´t have a home.

470
01:00:07,993 --> 01:00:09,663
That´s the truth.

471
01:00:12,063 --> 01:00:13,994
You have ours, don´t you?

472
01:00:14,195 --> 01:00:16,225
You never show up there.

473
01:00:18,795 --> 01:00:22,421
Well... that was before.

474
01:00:24,215 --> 01:00:28,353
I promess that if you come back with me,
all will be different.

475
01:00:28,353 --> 01:00:32,862
Look... I´ve though a lot about us.
You were right.

476
01:00:33,767 --> 01:00:36,559
- Keep your hands down!
- I made many mistakes.

477
01:00:36,743 --> 01:00:46,278
- I admit I left you alone because of my friends.
That´s over now. - Please, Roberto.

478
01:00:47,473 --> 01:00:54,333
Also, I admit I spent money when you
needed clothes and other things but...

479
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:57,003
Roberto, they can see you...

480
01:01:00,163 --> 01:01:04,726
Listen... we´re not going to let
nobody intercede in our lives.

481
01:01:05,346 --> 01:01:09,458
You know? I´m still in love with you.

482
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:15,688
Roberto, they´ll see us...

483
01:01:23,434 --> 01:01:27,330
I can´t live without you.
I need you.

484
01:01:28,611 --> 01:01:31,315
I promess we´re going to be very happy.

485
01:01:48,039 --> 01:01:52,185
- And we´re going to have a child.
- But not here.

486
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:10,598
- Look... It´s Ofelia.
- Yes, it´s me.

487
01:02:11,439 --> 01:02:13,428
How weird, isn´t it?

488
01:02:14,919 --> 01:02:17,386
Ofelia, what a surprise!

489
01:02:19,630 --> 01:02:21,332
- What a miracle...
- How are you?

490
01:02:21,345 --> 01:02:23,284
He came to talk with me.

491
01:02:23,529 --> 01:02:27,403
- Then, I won´t interrupt.
- No! He was leaving.

492
01:02:28,168 --> 01:02:30,174
But you didn´t answer yet.

493
01:02:30,943 --> 01:02:34,986
- I need some days to think about it.
- Ok, like you want.

494
01:02:35,421 --> 01:02:40,401
- See you, Ofelia. And congrats, very nice house.
- Thanks a lot, Roberto. - Bye!

495
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:51,291
- Ofelia, let me explain to you...
- It´s not necessary, my mother did it many years ago.

496
01:02:51,376 --> 01:02:57,896
- Don´t think that I was...
- Pilar, is your life and you can do whatever you want.

497
01:03:02,138 --> 01:03:04,399
We´re going to miss you a lot.

498
01:03:05,212 --> 01:03:07,693
I´ve not decided yet.

499
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:10,426
I don´t know what to do.

500
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,934
To start with, you can button up.

501
01:04:38,801 --> 01:04:40,199
José!

502
01:04:44,219 --> 01:04:46,105
José, is it you?!

503
01:04:50,316 --> 01:04:51,830
Answer me!

504
01:05:33,385 --> 01:05:37,669
What are you doing, José?!
Turn on the lights, please!

505
01:05:49,592 --> 01:05:51,423
Is it you, José?

506
01:06:09,887 --> 01:06:11,426
Answer me!

507
01:07:06,921 --> 01:07:10,138
LIBRARY

508
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:18,757
- It´s closed.
- She works until late.

509
01:07:18,858 --> 01:07:23,707
- Good night, Miss!
- Good night, I came to see Aurora. She´s still here?

510
01:07:23,707 --> 01:07:27,008
I think she´s gone, there´s nobody inside.

511
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:31,199
That´s not possible. I just finished to talk
with her and she said that she´d wait for me.

512
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:33,965
Ok, you can come in if you wish.

513
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:49,081
See? She isn´t here.
It´s been quite some time since I turned off the lights.

514
01:07:49,768 --> 01:07:52,887
Look! That´s her purse.
She´s still here.

515
01:07:53,034 --> 01:07:56,341
She must be in some of the warehouses.
I´m going to check.

516
01:08:02,049 --> 01:08:03,852
What a place!

517
01:08:04,549 --> 01:08:06,326
Where may be the lights?

518
01:08:16,506 --> 01:08:17,807
Aurora!

519
01:09:16,917 --> 01:09:18,183
Marta.

520
01:09:20,671 --> 01:09:22,740
What are you doing here?

521
01:09:24,316 --> 01:09:28,466
- Nothing.
- Why don´t you come with us? I don´t want you be alone.

522
01:09:28,573 --> 01:09:34,487
- I can´t stop thinking about Aurora. What could happen?
- What they told: the heart.

523
01:09:34,948 --> 01:09:36,446
Yes...

524
01:09:36,698 --> 01:09:40,879
...but do you know what makes one´s heart stop?

525
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:45,877
- The Fear.
- What are you talking about? Fear of what?

526
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:51,724
He had that fear for a long time,
since that night when she heard those voices.

527
01:09:51,968 --> 01:09:56,106
- And then the woman he saw at the library.
- That was pure imagination.

528
01:09:56,573 --> 01:09:59,797
You saw Aurora´s face after her death.

529
01:10:00,349 --> 01:10:06,729
Those fixed eyes, opened, full of fear...

530
01:10:07,771 --> 01:10:13,913
...I´ve been many hours here,
I keep asking myself...

531
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:17,453
What could it be the last thing she saw?

532
01:10:25,048 --> 01:10:29,281
Sofía, Pilar told me you wanted
to talk with me.

533
01:10:29,605 --> 01:10:33,908
- Don´t you think it´s quite excessive to put
flowers on a cat´s tomb? - Why?

534
01:10:35,874 --> 01:10:40,199
- That´s what they do in all the tombs.
- People´s tombs - It´s the same.

535
01:10:40,822 --> 01:10:45,929
They are lovely beings that we´ve lost.
Your aunt thought the same way.

536
01:10:46,446 --> 01:10:49,403
Ok. What did you want it to talk with me?

537
01:10:51,695 --> 01:10:57,313
- This´d be the last week at your service, Miss.
- Why Sofía?

538
01:10:58,446 --> 01:11:03,769
- Perhaps you don´t understand my reasons.
- Tell me, I´ve right to know.

539
01:11:04,151 --> 01:11:07,498
I knew Bequer´s death would brings disgrace.

540
01:11:08,224 --> 01:11:13,816
- And you already´ve saw what happened with Miss Aurora.
-  What does that have to do with the cat´s death?

541
01:11:13,947 --> 01:11:15,983
No with the cat.

542
01:11:17,090 --> 01:11:20,642
- I meant, with your aunt...
- My aunt is dead!

543
01:11:21,530 --> 01:11:25,354
- Your aunt is here.
- Please, Sofía!

544
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:29,409
I don´t know how you didn´t realize earlier.

545
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:33,202
Your aunt´s presence is in every corner
of this house...

546
01:11:33,285 --> 01:11:37,928
I´ve heard her crying through the nights
for Bequer´s death...

547
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:42,647
I´ve seen her wandering in the corridors,
looking through the windows.

548
01:11:42,903 --> 01:11:45,149
You must be out of your mind.

549
01:11:45,677 --> 01:11:47,961
I knew you wouldn´t understand me.

550
01:11:48,581 --> 01:11:54,626
But when I left, you´ll continue
to find flowers on Bequer´s tomb.

551
01:11:58,793 --> 01:12:03,566
- Why does she wants to leave?
- She gave me some silly reasons. I think we don´t like her.

552
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:08,002
- I knew it, I already imagined this.
- I asked her to stay until we find a new maid.

553
01:12:08,002 --> 01:12:10,353
I don´t want to put such weight on Pilar.

554
01:12:11,446 --> 01:12:16,517
- By the way, why did you take me out when Roberto arrived?
- They´ve to talk alone.

555
01:12:16,786 --> 01:12:21,302
- Do you think he´ll convince her?
- I don´t know but I assure you, he´s trying.

556
01:12:29,777 --> 01:12:31,494
No, Roberto, no!

557
01:12:31,695 --> 01:12:33,602
This ain´t all right...

558
01:12:33,608 --> 01:12:36,647
- I can make it better if you let me.
- Don´t make fun of it.

559
01:12:36,675 --> 01:12:41,094
- You know what I´m talking about.
- What´s wrong with that? You´re my wife, didn´t you?

560
01:12:41,105 --> 01:12:43,735
- Your ex!
- Nonsense!

561
01:12:44,116 --> 01:12:47,055
What´s more,
you agreed to come back to the house today.

562
01:12:47,136 --> 01:12:48,839
No, don´t rush me.

563
01:12:49,405 --> 01:12:52,009
I only promised to think about.

564
01:12:52,415 --> 01:12:55,113
But I haven´t decided anything yet.

565
01:12:55,519 --> 01:13:00,759
You can´t do this to me. I had everything arranged,
I even put flowers in all the house.

566
01:13:01,775 --> 01:13:05,480
The guys are arranging a party tomorrow
at Daniel´s place.

567
01:13:09,394 --> 01:13:11,748
I´m really sorry, Roberto.

568
01:13:13,125 --> 01:13:16,339
But...
I want to be sure.

569
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:24,131
Ok, like you want it.

570
01:13:27,888 --> 01:13:30,452
At least you can come with me
to the party.

571
01:13:30,750 --> 01:13:32,810
They´ll be pleased to see you.

572
01:13:33,423 --> 01:13:38,077
- Well... It´s possible if you promess to act formal.
- Of course!

573
01:13:40,745 --> 01:13:45,145
- We´ll remember our old times.
- No way. I said act formal.

574
01:13:47,678 --> 01:13:49,228
Do you remember?

575
01:13:50,643 --> 01:13:52,517
You were a pain in the ass.

576
01:13:54,791 --> 01:13:56,647
But you loved me.

577
01:13:59,913 --> 01:14:01,827
And you love me.

578
01:14:21,977 --> 01:14:24,521
Would you like something, Miss?

579
01:14:24,559 --> 01:14:27,453
Nothing, Sofía. Thanks, you can go.

580
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:30,742
Don´t you prefer I wait for Miss Ofelia?

581
01:14:30,744 --> 01:14:34,947
- Maybe she wants to dinner when she come back.
- No, she went with Marta to the theater.

582
01:14:34,947 --> 01:14:39,868
- I´m sure they´ll dinner in some place else.
- Do you wish I make you some company?

583
01:14:44,691 --> 01:14:50,409
- Can I ask why?
- It´s very late, you´re alone...

584
01:14:51,527 --> 01:14:53,911
...and you could be scared.

585
01:14:54,191 --> 01:15:00,322
No, Sofía. I don´t believe in ghosts,
if that´s what you mean.

586
01:15:00,615 --> 01:15:05,527
Excuse me, people usually have fear
of these old houses.

587
01:15:06,173 --> 01:15:07,929
Good night.

588
01:17:40,645 --> 01:17:41,914
Who is it?!

589
01:17:42,522 --> 01:17:44,042
Who´s there?!

590
01:18:18,590 --> 01:18:21,615
Sofía, is it you?!

591
01:19:07,559 --> 01:19:08,973
Sofía!

592
01:21:03,882 --> 01:21:07,029
Miss, what are you doing here?

593
01:21:11,562 --> 01:21:15,366
No, I didn´t see anything but...

594
01:21:16,395 --> 01:21:18,019
It was her!

595
01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:21,481
I´m sure!
- That´s not possible, Pilar.

596
01:21:21,971 --> 01:21:24,394
Did you see anything Sofía?

597
01:21:25,488 --> 01:21:29,869
No, Miss.
But I didn´t enter in the cellar.

598
01:21:30,232 --> 01:21:34,310
Why don´t you want to admit strange
things are happening in this house?

599
01:21:34,328 --> 01:21:40,079
- Of course I admit that but please
try some logical reasons! - It was her!

600
01:21:41,098 --> 01:21:46,501
- Right, Sofía? You know it was her!
- It´s not me who you need to convince.

601
01:21:46,571 --> 01:21:49,910
Why don´t you listen to me and go
to sleep? You really need it.

602
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:52,995
- Go with her, Sofía.
- Yes, Miss.

603
01:21:59,562 --> 01:22:01,573
Do you know what´s our problem?

604
01:22:02,390 --> 01:22:06,022
- Aurora´s death have us very nervous.
- Yes, maybe.

605
01:22:06,025 --> 01:22:11,607
The good thing is Roberto will come tomorrow.
He´ll take out to a meeting and everything´s forgotten.

606
01:22:33,492 --> 01:22:34,935
What´s wrong?

607
01:22:35,585 --> 01:22:37,659
Nothing. Why?

608
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:40,643
Did you realize I´m here with you?

609
01:22:40,643 --> 01:22:43,795
I´m sorry. I was distracted.

610
01:22:44,068 --> 01:22:46,056
Thinking about your ghost?

611
01:22:46,058 --> 01:22:51,585
- If you´re going to make fun of me...!
- It´s just that you haven´t thought about nothing else all night long.

612
01:22:51,585 --> 01:22:55,578
Damn! I never thought I´ll be
jealous of a ghost.

613
01:22:56,102 --> 01:22:59,928
You take things lightly`cause you don´t
have to return to the house.

614
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:03,611
What a boring couple!
Why don´t you dance?

615
01:23:05,929 --> 01:23:07,476
Do we?

616
01:23:07,581 --> 01:23:12,935
- No, Roberto. I´m not in the mood.
- C´mon, don´t be like that.

617
01:23:12,935 --> 01:23:15,251
Like the old times, come on...

618
01:23:38,811 --> 01:23:40,669
Follow her, you idiot!

619
01:23:42,135 --> 01:23:43,833
Follow her!

620
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:49,556
Pilar!

621
01:23:50,994 --> 01:23:52,417
What happened?

622
01:23:52,695 --> 01:23:57,084
You´re the same as always.
You don´t care about my problems.

623
01:23:57,155 --> 01:24:01,336
There isn´t any problem!
If you don´t want to come back to that house, don´t do it!

624
01:24:01,552 --> 01:24:04,160
Come with me and that´s the end of story.

625
01:24:05,094 --> 01:24:08,215
I don´t know...
I don´t know!

626
01:24:11,252 --> 01:24:13,786
Listen... I know I made things wrong.

627
01:24:13,867 --> 01:24:20,014
But, what do you prefer?
Spend the night with a ghost or with me?

628
01:24:21,203 --> 01:24:22,751
You fool...

629
01:24:44,341 --> 01:24:51,303
- Let´s see Ofelia´s face when I tell her!
- Better... you better see it tomorrow with more light!

630
01:24:58,128 --> 01:25:03,062
- I must let her know so she doesn´t worry.
- You should´ve called her by telephone.

631
01:25:04,730 --> 01:25:06,929
What?!

632
01:25:17,185 --> 01:25:19,278
- I won´t be long...
- Ok...

633
01:25:31,950 --> 01:25:33,795
Bring all your clothes!

634
01:27:01,270 --> 01:27:02,927
What happened?

635
01:27:07,245 --> 01:27:10,316
- I don´t know...
- Let´s carry her upstairs!

636
01:27:14,606 --> 01:27:16,423
Don´t get close.

637
01:27:17,902 --> 01:27:19,796
She´s dead.

638
01:27:43,741 --> 01:27:45,952
Did you want something, Sofía?

639
01:27:47,359 --> 01:27:48,815
No.

640
01:27:48,892 --> 01:27:52,329
I just wanted to see this bedroom one last time.

641
01:27:52,830 --> 01:27:54,927
It´s ok.

642
01:27:55,530 --> 01:27:59,157
Believe me. It´s not easy.

643
01:27:59,501 --> 01:28:04,209
This is the house where I´ve lived for many years.

644
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:07,755
It´s full of memories...

645
01:28:08,730 --> 01:28:14,137
It´s a part of myself.
- You don´t have to leave. Nobody is forcing you.

646
01:28:14,890 --> 01:28:17,498
You already know my reasons.

647
01:28:19,233 --> 01:28:25,019
- You´re really convinced that Marta and I, are in danger.
- Yes. That´s what I think.

648
01:28:26,512 --> 01:28:27,961
Sofía.

649
01:28:28,673 --> 01:28:37,168
- Do you think it´s appropiate to leave us at this moment?
- Miss Ofelia, I´m the first to regret what will happen here.

650
01:28:38,554 --> 01:28:42,454
But nor I or anybody can help it.

651
01:28:56,297 --> 01:28:57,713
Hello?

652
01:28:57,764 --> 01:29:00,709
Yes, Pedro. It´s me.
What happened?

653
01:29:02,204 --> 01:29:05,508
Oh, I see...
So..?

654
01:29:06,875 --> 01:29:08,400
Ok...

655
01:29:08,647 --> 01:29:15,132
- No, no... Why I would be angry? Kiss, bye.
- He won´t be coming?

656
01:29:15,487 --> 01:29:21,842
- He doesn´t even knows when. He´s in a meeting business.
- Well... It´s not so terrible news, isn´it?

657
01:29:21,875 --> 01:29:25,490
I already had the ilusion he´d take us out to dinner.

658
01:29:26,167 --> 01:29:29,747
I know what we´ll do.
We´ll arrange a party the both of us!

659
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:38,766
- Are you crazy? - No at all. We have alcohol, some sandwiches, put music,
let´s prove men they´re not indispensables.

660
01:29:40,712 --> 01:29:47,637
Sofía is a woman with strong ideas. She took her things and left.
- Yes, she said goodbye to me.

661
01:29:48,144 --> 01:29:54,700
- She seemed scared.
- I don´t regret it. She was influencing us with her strange ideas.

662
01:29:55,242 --> 01:30:01,307
- Now the house is very lonely.
- That´s why I wanted you to come with Pedro and me.

663
01:30:01,351 --> 01:30:05,650
That´s silly. You can´t keep me company every night.

664
01:30:06,195 --> 01:30:09,863
Well, at least until...
I´m not sure...

665
01:30:09,875 --> 01:30:17,634
A change, some days pass... or...
- Or aunt Susana kill one of us.

666
01:30:17,784 --> 01:30:21,272
- Marta!
- Why don´t you admit it, Ofelia?

667
01:30:22,308 --> 01:30:27,311
It wasn´t a heart attack or a fall
what killed Aurora and Pilar...

668
01:30:28,392 --> 01:30:29,883
It was the fear.

669
01:30:29,902 --> 01:30:32,818
What about? A ghost?

670
01:30:33,113 --> 01:30:36,617
- Both of them saw her.
- That´s what they believed.

671
01:30:37,307 --> 01:30:41,972
They saw her because she´s
here among us.

672
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:46,263
This house is full of her perfume
and her cryings...

673
01:30:46,530 --> 01:30:48,517
You sound like Sofía.

674
01:30:48,964 --> 01:30:50,340
Yes...

675
01:30:51,051 --> 01:30:54,667
Because I feel like her the
presence of this woman.

676
01:30:55,224 --> 01:30:58,251
I feel her in the dark threatened us...

677
01:30:58,523 --> 01:31:01,384
Watching us with her cold eyes...

678
01:31:01,807 --> 01:31:03,990
Stop the nonsense, Marta!

679
01:31:04,302 --> 01:31:08,907
Aunt Susana is dead,
no one ever come back from there.

680
01:31:10,424 --> 01:31:12,006
What happened?!

681
01:31:12,370 --> 01:31:14,925
The lights turned off.
There´s nothing to be worried about.

682
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:18,833
I´m going to light some candles.
I don´t like it this way.

683
01:31:21,322 --> 01:31:23,606
Let´s flare up the fire!

684
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:33,716
We´re going to have a beautiful fire!

685
01:31:34,483 --> 01:31:38,070
- What if there´s not enough wood?
- This won´t take too long.

686
01:31:38,307 --> 01:31:45,159
- Of course! I should have known. I´m going to check the switch.
- You´ll get soaking wet.

687
01:31:54,166 --> 01:31:55,783
I won´t take long.

688
01:32:39,724 --> 01:32:41,423
Rain almost stop.

689
01:32:44,299 --> 01:32:47,326
- What happens?
- Is her! Is her!

690
01:32:47,402 --> 01:32:50,349
- Who?!
- The old woman is there!

691
01:32:58,337 --> 01:33:00,040
How this got here?

692
01:33:06,915 --> 01:33:11,547
- It wasn´t here!
- Do you believe me now? - Did you see her?

693
01:33:11,905 --> 01:33:14,133
I saw her hand, she had her ring.

694
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:19,042
Can you see how you´re imagining things?
The ring is in my bedroom, inside the box!

695
01:33:19,522 --> 01:33:20,902
Are you sure?

696
01:33:34,571 --> 01:33:38,170
No! Don´t go to that room,
She´s in there...

697
01:33:39,856 --> 01:33:41,815
We´ll see about that.

698
01:33:55,224 --> 01:33:56,920
There´s no one here.

699
01:33:59,468 --> 01:34:01,832
And, of course, the ring is...

700
01:34:05,968 --> 01:34:08,088
Isn´t there...

701
01:34:09,401 --> 01:34:12,565
- Do you believe me now?
- Yes...

702
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:16,895
But... I can´t understand.

703
01:34:17,893 --> 01:34:21,067
She´s taking revenge for Bequer´s death.

704
01:34:21,607 --> 01:34:26,587
That´s the most unfair thing I´ve ever listened.
Bequer´s death was an accident, a distraction.

705
01:34:26,917 --> 01:34:29,340
Nobody wanted to hurt him.

706
01:34:31,387 --> 01:34:35,397
And now she wants to claim with 4 women lives.

707
01:34:37,123 --> 01:34:40,193
Now I know what aunt Susana was...

708
01:34:40,261 --> 01:34:43,551
... and old, twisted and cruel woman.

709
01:34:43,783 --> 01:34:46,687
Ofelia, listen to me.

710
01:34:46,687 --> 01:34:50,690
Tomorrow, I´ll throw that portrait in the fire!
I don´t want to see it ever again!

711
01:34:50,690 --> 01:34:53,883
Ofelia, there´s something you must know...

712
01:34:53,874 --> 01:35:02,635
...Bequer´s death it´s our own fault.
- I know that! But you didn´t know about the cat locked inside.

713
01:35:03,341 --> 01:35:05,118
No...

714
01:35:06,199 --> 01:35:10,591
That´s what we told you for you
don´t get angry with us.

715
01:35:11,690 --> 01:35:13,474
It was a lie.

716
01:35:17,536 --> 01:35:20,185
What are you saying?

717
01:35:20,498 --> 01:35:25,478
The day Aurora found her canary dead,
she had a fit of rage.

718
01:35:32,011 --> 01:35:38,385
We couldn´t stop her.
She took a poker and search for Bequer in the entire house.

719
01:35:45,002 --> 01:35:48,702
Finally, she found it in aunt Susana´s bedroom.

720
01:35:49,389 --> 01:35:52,956
She attacked and beat it many times.

721
01:35:56,278 --> 01:35:58,885
Bequer mew in a horrible sort of way.

722
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:10,113
Suddenly, it trew over her.

723
01:36:18,389 --> 01:36:22,922
Aurora screamed, terrified.
Pilar and I tried to help her.

724
01:36:26,525 --> 01:36:29,260
Fear seized us.

725
01:36:32,399 --> 01:36:35,184
I took the poker from the floor.

726
01:36:35,594 --> 01:36:39,438
Pilar took the candelabra...
Bequer didn´t die of hunger.

727
01:36:40,479 --> 01:36:42,368
We beat him to death.

728
01:36:49,601 --> 01:36:51,840
How could you do it?!

729
01:36:54,708 --> 01:36:59,698
I´ve regreted it a hundred times. I swear you.
Everything happened so fast.

730
01:36:59,810 --> 01:37:06,124
- No! That was a crime!
- I know. You have nothing to do with it.

731
01:37:06,610 --> 01:37:09,314
She´s taking revenge on us.

732
01:37:09,420 --> 01:37:14,670
- I´m the only one left.
- You´re in danger... We must leave this place!

733
01:37:14,780 --> 01:37:16,736
What for?

734
01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:19,691
There´s nothing we can do now.

735
01:37:20,705 --> 01:37:22,973
I´m marked.

736
01:37:23,306 --> 01:37:25,420
Maybe if we get out of this house!

737
01:37:26,332 --> 01:37:31,626
Aurora died in the library.
Far from this house.

738
01:37:32,986 --> 01:37:35,985
Pedro´s here!
Let´s go, Marta! Let´s go!

739
01:37:36,340 --> 01:37:39,690
It´s all useless, useless...

I go to get Pedro.
He´ll protect us!

741
01:37:52,290 --> 01:37:54,375
Pedro, I can´t open!

01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:56,937
- What happens!?
- I can´t explain you now! Jump the fence!

743
01:37:56,937 --> 01:37:59,818
- But, what happens?!
- Marta is in danger! Jump!

744
01:40:34,009 --> 01:40:35,476
Marta!

745
01:40:39,980 --> 01:40:42,049
Marta, where are you?

01:40:58,300 --> 01:41:00,787
Take me out of here, Pedro!
