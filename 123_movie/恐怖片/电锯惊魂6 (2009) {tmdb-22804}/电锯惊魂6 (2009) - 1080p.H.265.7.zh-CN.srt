1
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,807
Help!

2
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,641
- Eddie!
- What?

3
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:52,851
Eddie! Wake up!

4
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,153
- Don't move. Okay, listen to me.
- Where are we?

5
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,357
- Whatever you do, don't lean forward.
- What's this? What's...

6
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,238
- What's going on?
- No!

7
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:11,579
<i>Hello. I want to play a game</i>.

8
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:18,594
<i>The devices on your heads are symbolic</i>
<i>of the shackles that you place upon others.</i>

9
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,174
<i>You recklessly loan people money,</i>
<i>knowing their financial limitations,</i>

10
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:27,637
<i>counting on repossessing</i>
<i>more than they could ever pay back.</i>

11
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,604
<i>You are predators,</i>
<i>but today, you become the prey.</i>

12
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:36,107
<i>And it is your own pound of flesh</i>
<i>that I demand.</i>

13
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,278
This is your fault!

14
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:40,654
<i>The scale before you</i>
<i>is your only path to freedom.</i>

15
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:44,612
<i>However, only one of you may pass,</i>

16
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:48,290
<i>and the toll is the ultimate sacrifice,</i>

17
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,621
<i>the sacrifice of flesh</i>.

18
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:55,460
<i>Before you are the instruments</i>
<i>to exact this flesh.</i>

19
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,086
<i>Move with haste, though,</i>

20
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,260
<i>for when the 60-second timer hits zero,</i>

21
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:04,807
<i>the one who has given the most flesh</i>
<i>will release their bindings,</i>

22
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:10,479
<i>while the gears on your opponent's head</i>
<i>will engage, piercing their skull.</i>

23
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:14,774
<i>Who will offer the most flesh</i>
<i>in order to save their life?</i>

24
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,476
<i>The choice is yours</i>.

25
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,560
No!

26
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,666
I'm not dying for you, bitch!

27
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,052
No!

28
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,258
<i>I ask you, Special Agent Strahm,</i>

29
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,471
<i>have you learned enough to trust me?</i>

30
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:39,521
<i>For if you do not,</i>
<i>this room will forever be your tomb.</i>

31
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:43,942
<i>You will never be heard from again,</i>
<i>your body will never be found,</i>

32
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,315
<i>and my legacy will become yours</i>.

33
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,563
<i>Make your choice</i>.

34
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,353
There was a pre-existing condition,

35
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,185
which you did not inform
your insurance company of.

36
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,364
Thank you.

37
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:21,452
Hey, babe. Good. Listen, I am so, so sorry,
but I can't make dinner.

38
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:26,912
I've got to work late again.
Well, I've got to meet with legal,

39
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:31,376
and that's going to jam me up
for certainly, the rest of the afternoon.

40
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:37,764
I know it's your birthday.
I'm going to make it up to you, I promise.

41
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,386
Love you.

42
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,767
- What were we talking about?
- We're talking about your deposition.

43
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:49,977
Don't worry about me, Debbie.

44
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,062
Some small-time lawyer
trying to squeeze us

45
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,113
is not gonna get me to say
anything I don't want to say.

46
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,440
I have no doubt about that,

47
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,902
but as lead counsel for this company,
if you screw up, it comes down on my ass.

48
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,989
So what do you say
we prep your deposition?

49
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,414
Christ.

50
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,537
Do you remember dealing
with a Mr. Harold Abbott?

51
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,869
William, I have a Casey Patterson on line 1.

52
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:11,673
Take another message, Addy.
I'll get back to her this week.

53
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,001
Some time. Keep going.

54
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,303
When opposing counsel asks you
about Mr. Abbott, how will you respond?

55
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,221
I am going to respond by saying,

56
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,176
as Senior Vice President
of Membership and Claims,

57
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,182
it is my job
to review every terminated policy.

58
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,855
As a matter of fact, Mr. Abbott
was sitting right where you are now

59
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,933
when we discussed his appeal.

60
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,944
I just... I don't get it.

61
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,944
I've been with this insurance company
for over 10 years.

62
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:40,277
I know, Harold. But, unfortunately,
when we reviewed your claim,

63
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:43,283
we discovered that you failed to mention
a previous condition.

64
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,081
What condition? There was no condition.

65
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:50,879
It says here you had oral surgery
to remove a cyst from your jaw.

66
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,956
This is absurd! I have heart disease.

67
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,884
It has nothing to do with some oral surgery
I had 30 years ago.

68
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,212
Any type of oral surgery
is going to leave scar tissue.

69
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,013
Scar tissue can lead to gum disease.

70
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,764
And, as you well know,
gum disease can cause heart disease.

71
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,180
You know what? You're... You're a criminal.

72
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:12,142
You are a goddamn criminal.

73
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,897
I paid my monthly premium for 10 years
without so much as a cold.

74
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,733
And now that I'm actually sick,
you're going to deny my coverage?

75
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,820
- I have a family!
- Those are the rules, Harold.

76
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:26,077
I'm sorry,
but your own actions have caused this.

77
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:32,421
You've just given me a death sentence.
I mean, who's going to cover me now?

78
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,168
You just killed me.

79
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:40,049
I have family, too,
so I can empathize with his argument.

80
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,096
But, basically,
the guy lied on his application.

81
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,095
- Hey. Watch it, Will.
- What?

82
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,598
Do you think he did that on purpose?

83
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,395
All right.

84
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,358
It wasn't my job
to assess what his intentions were.

85
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,935
It was my job
to check the accuracy of his claim.

86
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,112
Look, everyody thinks we're the bad guys.

87
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,783
Nobody mentions the millions of people
we help every year without incident

88
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,408
or the millions of dollars
we donate to charity every year

89
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,204
or all the free clinics we support.

90
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,999
- Short answers, Will. Short answers.
- <i>Today in probate court,</i>

91
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:14,204
<i>the assets for one of history's</i>
<i>most notorious serial killers, John Kramer,</i>

92
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:15,584
<i>were distributed</i>.

93
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:19,133
<i>They were mainly in real estate holdings</i>.
<i>But in my time researching...</i>

94
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,633
One more question.
Who found the error on his application?

95
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:26,216
The dog pit. They work as a team.

96
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:31,684
If there's a discrepancy to be found
in an application, the six of them will find it.

97
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,981
Sir, they're waiting for you
in the conference room.

98
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,103
Very good.

99
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,820
- How's it going today, people?
- Great, Mr. E.

100
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,364
Found two application errors
for a chronically ill client.

101
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,818
This guy practically lives
at his doctor's office.

102
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,655
I mean, this could probably save us
nearly 200K over his lifetime.

103
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,159
Terminator strikes again.

104
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,411
I'll be back in a few hours.

105
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,539
Looking good, Hank.

106
00:11:55,757 --> 00:12:00,000
<i>Who will offer the most flesh</i>
<i>in order to save their life?</i>

107
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,800
<i>The choice is yours</i>.

108
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,220
<i>I'm not dying for you, bitch!</i>

109
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,647
Yeah.

110
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,727
I'm on my way.

111
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,041
What's going on?

112
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,461
Feds who took over the crime scene
are requesting you ASAP.

113
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,342
Erickson.

114
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:54,228
I didn't know you ever made it out
from behind the desk.

115
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:58,308
I make exceptions when fingerprints
are found at a Jigsaw murder scene.

116
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:01,815
Have a look.

117
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:06,984
We also got a right index off the scale.

118
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:11,496
- Been ID'd yet?
- Yeah. They're Agent Strahm's.

119
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,872
When I learned that he and Perez
were being targeted by Jigsaw,

120
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:20,751
I should have been more aware.
But I didn't see this coming.

121
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,082
Not from Peter Strahm.

122
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,667
- It was a shock to all of us.
- Yeah.

123
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:29,339
But we have something
he doesn't know about.

124
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,384
You want to follow me?

125
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,433
Lindsey.

126
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,156
- Detective Hoffman.
- Perez.

127
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,655
It was my call, Detective.

128
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,456
I knew that Jigsaw wasn't working alone,

129
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,000
but until I knew for certain
who was helping him,

130
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,294
I couldn't guarantee her well-being.

131
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:04,875
- So you let me think she was dead?
- Well, I didn't know who I could trust.

132
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,799
What else have you been keeping from me?

133
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,178
We know that Agent Strahm knew
the five people in the real estate scam,

134
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,384
the victims from the traps
that Erickson found.

135
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,561
- How'd he know them?
- Strahm and I investigated them

136
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,762
after the house fire.

137
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,394
It was arson
and all five people were accountable.

138
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:24,148
But after our lone witness went missing,
no charges were ever filed.

139
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,563
Strahm couldn't let them get away,
so he put them in a trap

140
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,990
in which slaughtering each other
was the only way out.

141
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,818
So, what are you telling me,
he's a vigilante?

142
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:34,950
Call him whatever you like,
but he has to be found.

143
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,995
We'd like to work together on this.

144
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,665
You led me to believe that she was dead,
and you want to work with me?

145
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,251
Look, we're offering full disclosure,
Detective.

146
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:52,305
From now on, everything we know,
you know. Is that fair?

147
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,641
Detective Hoffman,
how about a quick word?

148
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,694
Pamela Jenkins,
the resident Jigsaw sensationalist.

149
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,237
Just reportng the facts, Detective.

150
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:12,693
Is that what you're doing?
"John Kramer, conundrum of carnage."

151
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,323
If you'd like to make a statement
on the record,

152
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,870
I'd be more than happy to take it.

153
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:19,745
You know, twisting the facts
to make a better story is irresponsible.

154
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,043
Excuse me. Nice catching up.

155
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,418
I know more about John Kramer
than you might think.

156
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,255
Somehow I doubt that.

157
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:31,131
Kramer left his wife a box in his will.
Did you know that?

158
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,964
Maybe I did, maybe I didn t.
How do you know it?

159
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:37,346
Probate court. It's public record
for those who know where to look.

160
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,019
All right. What do you really want?

161
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:45,191
Jill Tuck. Help me get to her
and I'll dial down on the sensationalism.

162
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,645
Really? I'll see what I can do.

163
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,206
Do you remember
how you were transported there?

164
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,500
I don't know how I got there.

165
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:08,631
Just opened my eyes and...
He did this to me.

166
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,799
Who did this?

167
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,927
Jigsaw.

168
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:18,224
- You didn't cut your own arm off?
- I did. I did.

169
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,931
But he made me do it.

170
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,263
And why is that?

171
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:26,849
Because what Eddie and I were doing
was wrong.

172
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,696
We were... We were ruining people's lives.

173
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,615
And he wanted us to learn.

174
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:40,992
And did you?

175
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,285
Look at me.

176
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,585
Look at my goddamn arm!

177
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,792
What the fuck am I supposed to learn
from this, huh?

178
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:57,130
Look at my arm! What...
What am I supposed to learn from this?

179
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,681
- Just breathe.
- Look at me!

180
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,314
<i>Hello, Gideon.</i>

181
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:11,944
- <i>It's a good name, hon</i>.
- <i>Wow. Wow</i>.

182
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,615
<i>Could have been Scarlet</i>.
<i>But, no, has to be a boy.</i>

183
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,909
<i>Let me see</i>
<i>if I can get all three of us in there.</i>

184
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:23,748
<i>Snuggle around here</i>.
<i>Lean inside. There we go</i>.

185
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,617
- <i>There we are</i>.
- <i>Hey, Gideon.</i>

186
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,998
<i>Here's a little happy family</i>.

187
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,422
- <i>We love you, Son. We're waiting for you</i>.
- <i>We love you</i>.

188
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,935
<i>Gideon, Gideon, Gideon.</i>

189
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:49,436
<i>If you're watching this, Jill,</i>
<i>I'm long gone from this world.</i>

190
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:56,239
<i>I'm leaving you a box today,</i>
<i>and its contents are of grave importance.</i>

191
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:38,614
<i>Hello. I'm not in right now,</i>
<i>but please leave a message.</i>

192
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,659
<i>Miss Tuck, this is Pamela Jenkins calling,</i>
<i>yet again.</i>

193
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,488
<i>I was hoping you can clear some things up</i>
<i>for me about your husband.</i>

194
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,072
<i>Let me buy you lunch or a cup of coffee</i>.

195
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,204
<i>I've found something interesting</i>
<i>about John Kramer's death</i>.

196
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,703
<i>Are you there, Detective?</i>

197
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:57,167
<i>By hearing this tape,</i>
<i>you will likely assume this is over.</i>

198
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,757
<i>You feel you now have control, don't you?</i>

199
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,345
<i>You think you will walk away untested</i>.

200
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,106
Look here.

201
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,273
These are the Jigsaw pieces
cut from previous victims.

202
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,691
Th s is the piece
taken from the latest victim.

203
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,908
- It looks like all the rest.
- Yeah, that's what we said, too.

204
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:30,332
The skin abrasions, they're indicative
of a knife with a partially serrated edge.

205
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,375
- So?
- So, all of the other cuts were made

206
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,502
with a near-perfect blade
of surgical quality.

207
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,379
Obviously, Strahm used a different knife
than John Kramer.

208
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:47,308
Right. But it got us curious,
so we pulled the files to compare.

209
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,932
That same knife was used
on only one other victim.

210
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,762
And that victim was Seth Baxter,

211
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,519
the man who killed your sister.

212
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:59,938
You're telling me that you can tell
a different knife was used from a photo?

213
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,945
No, but I can.
I was the one who examined that body.

214
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,327
I've examined every victim
of the Jigsaw Killer.

215
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:08,495
Good work.

216
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:12,825
The tape from the latest victim was missing,
so we're looking into the Seth Baxter tape.

217
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,458
- Why's that?
- Well, if a different person cut the piece,

218
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,666
then maybe a different person
made the tape, too.

219
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,676
- Strahm?
- Yeah, maybe.

220
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,630
Strahm's voice on that tape
would be our smoking gun.

221
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:29,013
If we had that,
we'd go public with his involvement.

222
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,564
Hey, Jill.

223
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,149
- But that's not what the prescription...
- I'm sick!

224
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,697
- Look at me! Look at me!
- Hey. It's okay. Sorry.

225
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,588
I didn't expect to see you here so soon.

226
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,961
Change of plans.

227
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:10,975
- The game begins tonight.
- Why?

228
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,719
Because somebody knows about the box
that shouldn't.

229
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,679
- Who?
- That's not your concern.

230
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:20,394
All you need to know is that from now on,
I control all aspects of the game.

231
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:23,316
That's not what John wanted.

232
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:27,154
Give me the envelopes.
And that's not a request.

233
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:38,877
Here.

234
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:44,046
From now on, I work alone.

235
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:48,512
I know.
I'm only carrying out John's final request.

236
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:51,841
Well, John's dead.
And his work is almost done.

237
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,936
- Who's this?
- Unfinished business.

238
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:06,906
When I'm done, we no longer speak.

239
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,366
- ...forty-five minutes.
- Yes, I understand that.

240
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,042
- Please! Please.
- But we have to wait for the doctor.

241
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,710
Let my hand go.

242
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:26,710
Methadone is a masking agent.
It doesn't heal, it simply numbs the senses.

243
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:30,255
I've found a better way.

244
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:37,721
These people, they will continue to hurt you
and let you down.

245
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:40,811
They're addicts, John.
Recovery is a process.

246
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:44,143
Maybe addiction's just part
of human nature.

247
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:49,528
But what about these people, Jill,
who come here every day and use you?

248
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:54,328
They bide their time.
They're avoiding prison sentences.

249
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:58,078
They're getting hooked on masking agents.
Do you call that recovery?

250
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,783
It's not that simple.

251
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:04,088
Addiction is not simple, Jill! Wake up!

252
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:11,129
These people have no respect
for the lives that they're destroying.

253
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,924
Once you see death up close,

254
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,931
then you know what the value of life is.

255
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,356
And that's my way.

256
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,447
And I brought proof that it works.

257
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:41,288
- Amanda?
- Hello, Jill.

258
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,169
Jill,

259
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:51,381
you once told me that she was a lost soul.

260
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,552
But here she stands.

261
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,302
She's clean and whole.

262
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:05,350
And she has a new appreciation for her life.

263
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:10,479
It works. It's real. He helped me.

264
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,800
...<i>as this is not just</i>
<i>the macabre conjectures of a psychic,</i>

265
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:35,675
<i>but a foregone conclusion</i>
<i>just waiting to rear its ugly head.</i>

266
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:41,352
<i>Even though police would have you believe</i>
<i>John Kramer, aka Jigsaw, is dead,</i>

267
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,099
<i>just this past week a new so-called game</i>
<i>was discovered with grisly results.</i>

268
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,104
<i>Victims have included anyone associated</i>

269
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:51,437
<i>with the life of John Kramer,</i>
<i>however remote.</i>

270
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:55,696
<i>The Jigsaw Killer may be dead,</i>
<i>but the murders continue.</i>

271
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,417
Shit!

272
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:12,170
Hank, you still here?

273
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,742
Don't fucking move.

274
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,544
Shit! Oh, fuck! Okay.

275
00:25:58,015 --> 00:26:01,883
Okay, I'm gonna take care of you. Just...
Where'd you get hit? You wearing a vest?

276
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,719
<i>Hello, William</i>.

277
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:45,221
Oh, Jesus.

278
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:49,351
<i>You've probably been wondering</i>
<i>when we would see each other again.</i>

279
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,065
- <i>Today is that day</i>.
- No!

280
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:57,067
<i>For years, your probability formula</i>
<i>has decided the fate of others</i>.

281
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,442
<i>The healthy have benefited</i>

282
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:02,402
<i>while the potentially sick</i>
<i>have been unjustly rejected.</i>

283
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:07,206
<i>However, this formula does not take</i>
<i>into account the human will to live</i>.

284
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,748
<i>When faced with death,</i>

285
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:13,705
<i>who should live versus who will live</i>
<i>are two entirely separate things.</i>

286
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:17,000
<i>Today, your policy will be put to the test</i>.

287
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:22,134
<i>There are four straps around your limbs,</i>
<i>and you have four tests you must complete,</i>

288
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:27,931
<i>for if you don't, the straps on your arms</i>
<i>and legs will detonate</i>.

289
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,938
<i>Look closely</i>.

290
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,102
Oh, shit!

291
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:42,408
<i>You have 60 minutes to complete your tests</i>
<i>and avoid this fate, starting now.</i>

292
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,653
<i>You are not alone in thls game</i>.

293
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:48,614
<i>Just as you have taken loved ones away</i>
<i>from their families,</i>

294
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:51,542
<i>if you don't reach the end</i>
<i>before the timer hits zero,</i>

295
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,914
<i>you will never see your family again</i>.

296
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:02,261
Mom? Mom! Mom. Mom, wake up! Mom.

297
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,386
Mom.

298
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:09,718
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

299
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:12,889
- What is this?
- I don't know! Look.

300
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,770
Oh, my God.

301
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,737
<i>Here is your first test</i>.

302
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:30,247
<i>Your health and hereditary background</i>
<i>put you in the highest category of success.</i>

303
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,872
<i>However, the same cannot be said</i>
<i>for your adversary</i>.

304
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:40,378
<i>While only 52 years of age,</i>
<i>this man has continued to smoke</i>

305
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:44,929
<i>even though he has a history</i>
<i>of high blood pressure and heart disease.</i>

306
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:49,975
<i>This demonstrates very little appreciation</i>
<i>for the blessings of his own life.</i>

307
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:54,931
<i>Your game will focus</i>
<i>on the simple element of air.</i>

308
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:58,893
<i>Once this game begins,</i>
<i>every time you take a breath,</i>

309
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:03,401
<i>the clamps around your chest will close in</i>
<i>and crush your body.</i>

310
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:07,451
<i>The only escape is in the other's failure</i>.

311
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:11,371
<i>So I ask you, when faced with death,</i>
<i>who will survive?</i>

312
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:16,456
<i>Live or die, William. Make your choice</i>.

313
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,334
- Fuck you!
- Who the hell is that?

314
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:27,963
Hold your breath!

315
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:21,334
What the fuck? Oh, Jesus!

316
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,652
Come on! Come on!

317
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:05,794
Shit!

318
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,257
Please help us!

319
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:20,890
Help us! Someone, please! Please! Help us!

320
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:27,192
Somebody, please! Please!
Please, somebody help!

321
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,644
Anybody?

322
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,693
"Live. Die." What the fuck?

323
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,823
It's connected to that.

324
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:47,337
- "H-F." What does that stand for?
- Hydrofluoric acid.

325
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:54,590
This stuff will eat through human flesh
within seconds.

326
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:58,924
- What should we do?
- Pull the lever. You want to live, don't you?

327
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:02,182
What about the timer?
That has to mean something.

328
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:06,060
I don't know.
I don't even know why we're here.

329
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,230
We're here because of your father.

330
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,650
Miss Jenkins.

331
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,612
Please, this will only take a second.
We can help each other.

332
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,947
What makes you think
you can just come to my door like this?

333
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,159
Because I found something
you'll want to see.

334
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,164
Go on.

335
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:17,218
- Where'd you get this?
- It was at the location where John died.

336
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,762
- Does it mean anything to you?
- No.

337
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,799
Goodbye, Miss Jenkins.

338
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,640
If you think of anything.

339
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:32,043
<i>I want to thank you</i>
<i>for sponsoring this party, William.</i>

340
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,247
<i>And I know</i>
<i>how much the clinic appreciates it.</i>

341
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,087
- John Kramer.
- William Easton.

342
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,710
- Kramer? You're Jill's husband, right?
- I am.

343
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:43,509
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

344
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,890
<i>Sounds like we're</i>
<i>in a similar business, John</i>.

345
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,012
<i>Oh, yeah? How's that?</i>

346
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:50,391
Well, you try to predict people's behavior.
So do I.

347
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,773
When people come to us for coverage,

348
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,694
we have to analyze each person
for the probability of success.

349
00:35:58,198 --> 00:36:00,189
- How do you do that?
- Well, it's a formula.

350
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:02,649
It's pretty complicated actually,

351
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:05,201
but, in essence,
it breaks down to monthly payments

352
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:08,530
multiplied by lifespan
minus the probability of illness.

353
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,788
And if the sum is positive,
we consider coverage.

354
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:17,213
- Who devised that formula?
- Me.

355
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:22,302
So, in a sense,
you choose who lives or dies.

356
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:27,887
No. I... No, I'd say I decide which people
have the potential

357
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,093
to live long, healthy lives.

358
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:34,890
But you're not taking into consideration
the most important human element of all.

359
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,896
- Which is what?
- The will to live.

360
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,646
Until a person is faced with death,

361
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:46,693
it's impossible to tell
whether they have what it takes to survive.

362
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,421
Fuck that.

363
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:44,842
Shit.

364
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:10,819
<i>Hello, William</i>.

365
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:15,374
<i>Standing on the platforms behind me</i>
<i>are two of your colleagues.</i>

366
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:20,295
<i>One, your file clerk, a young, healthy male</i>
<i>with no living relatives</i>.

367
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:26,840
<i>The other, a middle-aged woman</i>
<i>with a family history of diabetes.</i>

368
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:32,349
<i>According to your policy,</i>
<i>your secretary is older and weaker</i>

369
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:35,518
<i>and therefore less worthy to survive</i>.

370
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:39,310
<i>But you know the loss</i>
<i>that she will be to her family,</i>

371
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:44,190
<i>while young Allen will disappear</i>
<i>without a blip on the world's radar.</i>

372
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:50,902
<i>Only one can exit this room,</i>
<i>and the choice of whom falls upon you</i>.

373
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:55,990
<i>You must let go of one</i>
<i>to save the life of the other</i>.

374
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:58,621
<i>As you can see, the choice is not so clear</i>

375
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:03,330
<i>when you are face to face with the people</i>
<i>whose blood will stain your hands</i>.

376
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,207
<i>Let the game begin</i>.

377
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:13,924
Wait! No! No, wait!
I won't do this! I won't do this!

378
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:25,314
William!

379
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:28,943
It's a business!
My decisions aren't made this way!

380
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,907
No, I'm not gonna do it! I m not gonna do it!

381
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:36,909
I'm not gonna do it!

382
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:43,961
- Stop!
- Please! Help me!

383
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,441
- I'm sorry.
- No! No!

384
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:18,955
I'm sorry.

385
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:58,907
Thank you. Thank you!

386
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:09,419
You try to find a way out of here, Addy.
I have to keep going. Be careful.

387
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,747
What if we put acid on the metal bars?
It'll eat through the metal, won't it?

388
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:46,418
Yeah, but how are we going to get it
on the bars? With our hands?

389
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:52,298
What are you looking at?

390
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:55,210
I wonder... The mirror.

391
00:41:57,265 --> 00:42:00,632
- What?
- Who's behind the glass?

392
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:05,303
What do you want?

393
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,765
Why are you doing this?

394
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:15,696
Help me, please! Please, help me!

395
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:35,125
<i>Hello, Pamela</i>.
<i>You've sensationalized my life,</i>

396
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:39,508
<i>twisting the truth and exploiting</i>
<i>my message for your own benefit.</i>

397
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,622
- Hoffman.
- <i>It's Erickson</i>.

398
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:11,536
- <i>We found the Seth Baxter tape</i>.
- Yeah?

399
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,584
But there was something else
that we wanted to discuss with you.

400
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:18,130
- What's that?
- <i>Better to talk about it in person.</i>

401
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:19,961
It's time-sensitive.

402
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,509
I'll be right there.

403
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:39,313
Excuse me.

404
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,150
- Just down there.
- Thank you.

405
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:09,268
<i>The device Timothy is strapped to</i>
<i>is my personal favorite. I call it The Rack.</i>

406
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:23,195
Last-minute tweaks?
Told you he'd fuck with it.

407
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:25,114
If you switch the gear ratio,

408
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:29,322
you have to change the gear grease
to match the increased friction.

409
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:33,455
Maybe you should stick to the heavy lifting.

410
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:36,712
You need five-weight.

411
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,881
It's in the gun.

412
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:42,509
Check with me next time.

413
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,670
How many next times are there gonna be?

414
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:47,347
However many there needs to be.

415
00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:58,734
That's a human being.

416
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:05,157
Do you like how brutality feels, Mark?

417
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:09,328
Let's be honest. You want him to suffer
just as much as I do.

418
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:36,848
- So when's your test, Detective?
- I don't need one.

419
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,316
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

420
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:43,780
Because I didn't take my life for granted.

421
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:47,700
You're still dragging your knuckles
on the ground.

422
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:49,743
What do you know about life?

423
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:59,962
Get used to me,
'cause I'm not going anywhere.

424
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:05,422
You sure about that?

425
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:09,422
Time is short.

426
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:16,554
You okay?

427
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:23,061
Now it's time to go get Dr. Denlon
from the hospital.

428
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:26,568
Okay. I'll take you back.

429
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,887
Go. Be quick.

430
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:10,404
- Why'd you come?
- John, please stop.

431
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:14,032
- Don't do this.
- I promise you,

432
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,657
when all this is done,

433
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:24,288
I will provide a way out for you.

434
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:28,877
I wish that time was now.

435
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,505
Then I have something for you.

436
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:47,900
What's this for?

437
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:56,078
When the time's right,
you'll know what to do with it.

438
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:26,941
Shit!

439
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:41,449
<i>I came to talk to you, Will, because</i>

440
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:47,463
I've found a treatment for my cancer
that I think holds a lot of promise.

441
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:49,666
But my requests for coverage

442
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:54,045
- have all been turned down.
- Yeah.

443
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,847
So I was hoping that if I came
and explained it to you,

444
00:48:56,934 --> 00:49:00,301
that you might be able
to get that overturned for me.

445
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:06,478
- Well, the buck stops here, John. Fire away.
- Okay.

446
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:11,604
This is a doctor in Norway.

447
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:16,284
He's got a 30 to 40% Success rate
with gene therapy.

448
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:21,740
He injects what he calls suicide genes
into cancerous tumor cells.

449
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:25,167
Then an inactive form of a toxic drug
is administered...

450
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:28,496
Yes. I'm familiar with the therapy
you're talking about.

451
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:31,628
Right. And a new trial's starting.

452
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:33,255
He's looking for new patients,

453
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,461
and he seems to think
that I'm the perfect candidate.

454
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:39,549
John, if your primary physician, Dr. Gordon,
thought you were a suitable candidate,

455
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,055
- he would have pursued it.
- No.

456
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:45,559
Dr. Gordon is a specialist. You know,
he's making money on his specialty.

457
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,264
He's not a thinker.

458
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:50,396
I mean, the man has his hand
on the doorknob half the time that I'm there.

459
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:54,106
I'm gonna be straight with you. At your age
and with the development of your cancer,

460
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,940
it's simply not feasible
for Umbrella Health...

461
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:58,947
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What's not feasible?

462
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:02,906
By whose mathematical equation
is this not feasible?

463
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,958
It's policy, John. It's policy.

464
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:09,704
And if you go outside the system
and seek out this treatment,

465
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:13,757
which has been deemed ineffective,
you will be in breach of policy

466
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,586
and you will be dropped
from coverage completely.

467
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:18,720
I'm sorry.

468
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,892
Did you know that in the Far East,

469
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:34,729
people pay their doctors
when they're healthy?

470
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,736
When they're sick,
they don't have to pay them.

471
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:43,366
So, basically,
they end up paying for what they want,

472
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,448
not what they don't want.

473
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,414
We got it all ass-backwards here.

474
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:55,838
These politicians, they say the same thing
over and over and over again.

475
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:59,887
"Healthcare decisions should be made
by doctors and their patients,

476
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:01,180
"not by the government."

477
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:04,805
Well, now I know they're not made
by doctors and their patients

478
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,681
or by the government.

479
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:11,148
They're made
by the fucking insurance companies.

480
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:13,851
Piranha.

481
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:21,284
John, please.
If you do this, you'll be on your own,

482
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:23,656
and the subsequent cost to you
will be staggering.

483
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:27,160
Don't talk to me about money.
I have money.

484
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,708
This is about principle.

485
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:39,218
You see, Will,
this is my life we're talking about.

486
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,469
- You remember?
- What about Jill's life?

487
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:43,047
How's she going to be taken care of
when you're gone?

488
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:45,133
Let me worry about Jill.

489
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:49,512
The type of cancer you have
is malignant and inoperable.

490
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:51,472
That rolled off your tongue real smooth.

491
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:54,525
Even if the treatment works,
the cancer will return eventually.

492
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:58,070
- It's an unwinnable battle.
- That was even smoother.

493
00:51:58,157 --> 00:52:01,149
As a matter of fact,
that was downright slick.

494
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:06,992
You think it's the living
who will have ultimate judgment over you,

495
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:10,620
because the dead will have no claim
over your soul,

496
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:23,011
but you may be mistaken.

497
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:40,070
Oh, shit!

498
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:52,533
<i>Hello, William</i>.
<i>You have seen the flaws in your policy.</i>

499
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:56,337
<i>But what you have not seen</i>
<i>is the extent some people will go to</i>

500
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,288
<i>when faced with death</i>.

501
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:03,419
<i>The lawyer from your firm has</i>...

502
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:05,926
- Debbie!
- ...<i>90 seconds to cross this room</i>

503
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:10,259
<i>or the device attached to her chest</i>
<i>will discharge and pierce her brain.</i>

504
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:13,061
It's gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay.

505
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:17,391
<i>She will find that the journey</i>
<i>across this room is filled with danger</i>.

506
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:22,856
<i>In order for her to make it,</i>
<i>you will need to be there for her,</i>

507
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:27,535
<i>and it is you who ultimately holds the key</i>
<i>to her survival</i>.

508
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:32,744
<i>When faced with death,</i>
<i>will she have the skills to live?</i>

509
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:35,242
<i>Let the game begin</i>.

510
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:39,830
Okay. Okay, listen!

511
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:42,632
- Jesus Christ! What the fuck is this?
- Debbie! Debbie! Listen to me!

512
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,712
- Debbie! Okay, Debbie, listen to me! Debbie!
- What is this?

513
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:48,343
- Get me the fuck out of here!
- Get through the maze

514
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:49,924
as fast as you can. Listen to me!

515
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,974
- Get me out of here!
- Debbie!

516
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:57,648
Okay. You've got to get through this maze
as fast as you can! Go! Move now! Go now!

517
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:04,651
Come on! You can make it! You can make it!
You got to keep moving! Go!

518
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:08,701
- Will, this is insane! I can't!
- Go! You can make it!

519
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:11,950
Come on! You can make it!
You've got to keep moving!

520
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,916
Wait a minute!
I think I can help you up here!

521
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:21,963
Maybe this will stop it!

522
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:27,253
Yes! Yes!

523
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:30,047
Do it again! It worked! It worked!

524
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:33,259
- Do it again! It worked, it worked, it worked!
- Okay! Ready?

525
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:35,435
- Yes!
- Go!

526
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:55,998
Keep moving! Don't stop!
Keep going! Keep going! Keep going!

527
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,450
Don't stop!

528
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:04,006
You gotta keep going! Keep going! Go! Go!

529
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:08,006
Keep moving! Go! Go! Go!

530
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:13,841
Fuck, I can't! It's a fucking trap!
There's no way out!

531
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:18,020
It's a fucking trap! I can't!

532
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:26,187
No! No, there's a ladder at the end!
So just go under! I'll help you!

533
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:29,652
Ready?

534
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,151
Go!

535
00:55:52,808 --> 00:55:58,098
God! Come on, Debbie, go! Climb! Climb!

536
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:02,898
Come on! Come on, you're almost there!
You're almost there!

537
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:06,227
Go! Go! Go!

538
00:56:07,406 --> 00:56:11,820
Okay, look for a key.
There's got to be a key! Look for a key!

539
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:15,702
What?

540
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,489
What are you waiting for?

541
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:21,792
- It's in you.
- What?

542
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:24,996
- It's fucking inside you!
- Oh, fuck!

543
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:32,253
Okay. Okay, I can do this. Wait!

544
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:36,431
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I need that fucking key!

545
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:58,612
I can get it! I can get it! I can get it!

546
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,452
God! No! God! No!

547
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,188
<i>Hello, Pamela</i>.

548
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:39,369
<i>Well, today you will experience</i>
<i>the meaning of sacrifice.</i>

549
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:44,075
<i>And you will see the consequence</i>
<i>for those who unjustly hurt others.</i>

550
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:45,375
Fuck!

551
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:09,107
Someone's there. They're watching us.

552
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:13,354
Why? Why would someone do this?

553
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:15,313
To see how we respond.

554
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:19,159
They want to know
what decision we'll make.

555
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:24,494
- Let's pull it.
- No! We don't know what it does yet.

556
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:26,120
It's too risky.

557
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:30,875
Fuck!

558
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:38,294
Hey.

559
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:41,264
- Thanks for coming in.
- What'd you find?

560
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,558
- An abnormality in Strahm's fingerprint.
- What?

561
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,010
Take a look.

562
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,643
So the human fingerprint leaves
an oily residue,

563
00:58:49,735 --> 00:58:52,021
and depending on how long
it's been exposed to the elements,

564
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:55,024
- it's highly susceptible to contamination.
- So what's the problem?

565
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:58,448
Well, we found trace amounts
of halomethane R-12.

566
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,491
She means Freon.

567
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:02,945
Production of R-12 ceased in 1994.

568
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,703
So the question is, was the contaminant
we found at the site already

569
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,624
or did Strahm bring it in with him?

570
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:10,498
Yeah. We're looking
into the building's function

571
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:12,545
before it was abandoned.

572
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:15,215
Excuse me.

573
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:19,215
Did anything come
from the Seth Baxter tape?

574
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:22,389
Yeah, actually,
we might be on to something.

575
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:24,182
The tape was in pretty rough shape
when we found it,

576
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:25,884
but we were able to authenticate it.

577
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:30,439
The voice was intentionally distorted,
but it didn't match John Kramer's.

578
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:33,642
- It's currently being analyzed.
- For what?

579
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:37,776
Well, we're trying to descramble the tape
to find the original voice.

580
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:40,198
He's on with the tech right now.

581
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:45,278
Are you timing something? Your watch.

582
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:49,366
I was before I got your call, yeah.

583
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:53,962
We got it. This is our smoking gun.

584
00:59:55,467 --> 00:59:57,958
The lab's off-site. Come on.

585
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:02,634
- You're coming, right?
- Of course.

586
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:41,172
You shut up! All you do
is try to take over every situation.

587
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:42,589
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about!

588
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:44,171
Shut the fuck up!

589
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:47,599
- Fuck off!
- Would you two just shut up already!

590
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:48,971
We can figure this out.

591
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:52,554
- Hey! Who's in there?
- Mr. Easton? Is that you?

592
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:55,766
- Yeah. Shelby? Who's in there with you?
- Mr. Easton!

593
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:58,523
We're all in here, sir. All six of us.
What the hell is going on?

594
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:00,103
Everybody! We need your help.

595
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:01,779
What can you see?

596
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:04,529
We can't see anything. It's pitch dark.

597
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:08,445
- What's that sound?
- I don't know, something we're chained to.

598
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:11,452
- It's spinning. Oh, God.
- Get us out of here!

599
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,041
- You have to help us!
- Please!

600
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:17,166
Come on, get us out of here, Mr. E!

601
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:26,092
Mr. Easton!

602
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:29,471
Mr. Easton! You got to get us out of here!

603
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:30,892
Oh, my God!

604
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:34,346
Pull it together, Mr. Easton. Come on!

605
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:36,102
- You can do it!
- You can do it!

606
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:38,184
Mr. Easton! Mr. Easton!

607
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:40,985
Please! Please get us out of here! Please!

608
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:43,063
Mr. Easton, what is this?

609
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:46,942
It's a game.

610
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:49,240
- Game?
- Mr. Easton?

611
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:04,635
<i>Hello, William. Before you are six</i>
<i>of your most valuable associates,</i>

612
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,633
<i>the ones who find errors in policies</i>.

613
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:10,386
<i>Their findings result in over two-thirds</i>

614
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:14,516
<i>of all applications denied</i>
<i>or prematurely terminated.</i>

615
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:20,101
<i>Now you must apply your analysis to them</i>.
<i>And will you be able to find their errors?</i>

616
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:23,311
<i>Six ride the carousel.</i>

617
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:28,942
<i>But only two can get off</i>.

618
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:33,572
<i>The decision of which two survive</i>
<i>falls upon you.</i>

619
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:37,580
<i>But remember,</i>
<i>the mounted gun will continue to fire</i>

620
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:39,957
<i>until all six rounds are spent</i>.

621
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:44,921
<i>And if no decision is made on your part,</i>
<i>all six will perish</i>.

622
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:46,710
What? What?

623
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:48,796
<i>To offer the two reprieves,</i>

624
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:53,384
<i>you must press both buttons at once</i>
<i>in the box before you.</i>

625
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:57,847
<i>However, in doing so</i>
<i>you'll give a sacrifice of your own.</i>

626
01:02:57,941 --> 01:03:00,774
<i>Two can live, four will die</i>.

627
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:05,149
<i>Your decision's symbolized</i>
<i>by the blood on your hands.</i>

628
01:03:10,412 --> 01:03:13,870
Mr. Easton, wake up!
You gotta get us out of here!

629
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:16,164
- Pick me!
- Mr. Easton, come on!

630
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:19,869
Listen to me.
Mr. Easton, I am the one who should live.

631
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:22,166
- Do something!
- Fuck.

632
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,258
Jesus Christ!

633
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:32,097
Please, Mr. Easton! Mr. Easton! Please!

634
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:35,220
Follow the policy, Mr. Easton. Do it!

635
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:39,897
Please! Mr. Easton, follow the policy!
Follow the policy!

636
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:45,981
- Holy shit!
- Oh, my God!

637
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,401
- No!
- Oh, my God!

638
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:50,982
What the fuck!

639
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:53,326
- What the fuck!
- No!

640
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:59,082
Mr. E! They say we're only as strong
as the weakest link!

641
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:01,410
I'm the strongest! You can't let me die!

642
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:04,792
Fuck him!
I'm healthy, sir. I'm healthy! Please!

643
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:06,794
Mr. Easton, come on!

644
01:04:06,885 --> 01:04:10,503
No, I have two kids.
You know them well. Please!

645
01:04:10,597 --> 01:04:14,215
Please, they can't grow up without me!
They need me!

646
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:21,893
Oh, shit!

647
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:37,579
Thank you! Thank you!

648
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:40,156
- Fucking hell!
- Thank you.

649
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:43,243
Fuck her!
You don't even know her, Mr. Easton.

650
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:46,963
Listen to me, okay?
My parents are sick, okay?

651
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:49,257
- They need me. I'm all they have, please!
- You fucking liar!

652
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:51,676
- Your parents hate you! They cut you off!
- What?

653
01:04:51,763 --> 01:04:54,926
- Shut up! That's not true!
- Fuck you, it is true. I sit next to you!

654
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:58,850
- I... I'm pregnant. I'm pregnant!
- No, she's not! She's lying!

655
01:04:58,937 --> 01:05:00,552
- She's fucking lying!
- Fuck you!

656
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:02,512
- Mr. Easton, she is lying!
- I'm pregnant!

657
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:05,189
- She's lying.
- No! No, fuck!

658
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:06,766
- I'm pregnant!
- She's fucking lying!

659
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:10,445
He's lying. Mr. Easton, it's not true!
Please! Please!

660
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:13,691
Fuck! Push the thing! Push the thing!

661
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:15,901
- She's lying.
- No!

662
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:19,283
- Mr. Easton, push it! Push the thing!
- Oh, God! No!

663
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:22,957
Push it!

664
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:26,912
Oh, God! What the...

665
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:30,332
What the fuck!

666
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:34,051
You have to trust me! I won't lie to you!

667
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:37,597
- Oh, please! He's a kiss-ass!
- Mr. Easton! My parents are loaded!

668
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:39,299
- Oh, God!
- They'll give you whatever you want!

669
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:40,600
- Just say a number!
- He's a thief!

670
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:42,643
He's been stealing from the company
for years!

671
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:46,348
It's true! It's true! It's true! It's true!

672
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:48,149
- Thief!
- Fuck you!

673
01:05:48,236 --> 01:05:50,568
- It's true! He has been...
- Don't listen to them!

674
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:53,488
- Don't isten to them, Mr. E!
- It's true!

675
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:58,114
Christ! Mr. Easton, come on! Mr. Easton...

676
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:10,914
Okay, Mr Easton, isten to me carefully.
I'm on your side, and I can help you.

677
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:16,428
- But you cannot trust this bitch!
- What? Fuck you!

678
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:18,379
- She's a fucking liar!
- What?

679
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:22,093
You cannot believe her.
She has already tried to lie!

680
01:06:22,187 --> 01:06:26,146
And she's just going to continue to do it!
You know it!

681
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:27,642
It's me, Josh!

682
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:32,068
No, I haven't! What about you?
He wants to be you! Okay, you know that!

683
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:35,613
But he'll slit your throat
at the first opportunity!

684
01:06:38,036 --> 01:06:41,949
Please don't let me die! Please! No, please!

685
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:51,292
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, fuck!

686
01:06:58,181 --> 01:06:59,717
Oh, God!

687
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:04,684
Thank you!

688
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:11,308
Oh, well, that's it, isn't it? It's over!

689
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:14,816
- You motherfucker!
- Stop it!

690
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:19,570
You spineless,
pussy-whipped motherfucker!

691
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:24,745
That's all it takes, eh?
A bitch says one thing and it's all over!

692
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:30,415
You know what, William?
Your policy, it's bullshit!

693
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:32,794
Fucking bullshit!

694
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:36,424
Well, you listen to me, you son of a bitch!

695
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:38,961
I did everything for you.

696
01:07:44,352 --> 01:07:48,265
Look at me!
When you're killing me, you look at me!

697
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:02,116
Thank you.

698
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:05,911
Oh, my God!

699
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:09,703
- Thank you.
- Emily.

700
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:35,266
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless</i>.

701
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:39,145
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless</i>.

702
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:42,695
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless</i>.

703
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:47,036
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless</i>.

704
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:51,579
- How's it going?
- Good.

705
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:54,835
This is it.

706
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:57,088
Whoever made this tape had access

707
01:08:57,175 --> 01:08:59,837
to some very impressive
audio-filtration equipment.

708
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:02,634
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless</i>.

709
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:05,634
Fortunately, we have some tricks
of our own here.

710
01:09:05,725 --> 01:09:10,594
We can turn his algorithm upside down
and let us hear what he really sounds like.

711
01:09:13,107 --> 01:09:15,018
Let's hear what you got.

712
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:20,441
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless</i>.

713
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:22,898
You okay?

714
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:26,860
You seem a little preoccupied.

715
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:29,286
I'm just anxious about the tape.

716
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:34,242
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless</i>.

717
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:38,539
- <i>Right now, you're feeling helpless</i>.
- You know, there are still a couple of things

718
01:09:38,633 --> 01:09:42,296
- I can't quite wrap my head around.
- <i>Right now, you're feeling helpless</i>.

719
01:09:42,387 --> 01:09:45,379
Like, I don't understand
Strahm's motivation.

720
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:48,047
He was my partner for five years.

721
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:50,349
I mean,
we all knew he was a bit of a hothead.

722
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:53,894
But I never saw any indication
of psychotic behavior.

723
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:57,940
You never can really tell
what someone's thinking on the inside.

724
01:10:01,114 --> 01:10:02,524
...<i>helpless</i>.

725
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:06,157
- Hear that?
- <i>Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>

726
01:10:06,244 --> 01:10:07,529
We're getting there.

727
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:10,157
Come on,
I thought you had something to show us.

728
01:10:10,248 --> 01:10:13,285
Yeah, it's just I never really thought of him
as being vengeful.

729
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:18,211
- <i>Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>
- You know? I mean, all the facts are there.

730
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:25,627
- But something doesn't sit right.
- Listen. It's getting closer.

731
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:29,089
- <i>Right now, you're feeling...</i>
- You know, there is an alternative.

732
01:10:29,183 --> 01:10:32,175
Let's say that Strahm killed Seth Baxter

733
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:36,229
specifically to set you up as an accomplice
to Jigsaw.

734
01:10:36,315 --> 01:10:37,430
Okay.

735
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:41,059
Well, there's a problem with that, though.

736
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:43,145
On further analysis of Strahm's fingerprints,

737
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:46,697
it was found that the uric acid levels
in the eccrine gland residue

738
01:10:46,784 --> 01:10:52,324
were inconsistent for an individual
with an active epidermal metabolism.

739
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,951
In other words?

740
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:57,159
In other words, when he left his fingerprints
on the latest victim,

741
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:58,584
Strahm was already dead.

742
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:01,333
- <i>Right now, you're feeling helpless</i>.
- There it is.

743
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:03,915
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless</i>.

744
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:30,115
Who else knows about me?

745
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:34,036
Who else fucking knows about me?

746
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,744
- Everyone.
- You lie. You're fucking lying.

747
01:14:27,755 --> 01:14:29,461
I found something you'll want to see.

748
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:31,459
It was at the location where John died.

749
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:32,665
Does it mean anything to you?

750
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:39,004
What are you doing?

751
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:41,557
Get as far away from the sprinkler head
as possible.

752
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:42,850
We don't know what it does!

753
01:14:42,937 --> 01:14:44,643
I'm not gonna just sit here and do nothing.

754
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:47,893
We need to make a decision!
Don't you understand?

755
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:14,249
Okay. You can pull it. I love you.

756
01:15:14,885 --> 01:15:18,127
I love you, too. Get back.

757
01:15:22,101 --> 01:15:24,387
No. You don't know what it does!

758
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:38,360
- On three, I'll pull it.
- Okay.

759
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:40,741
No. No.

760
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:44,410
One,

761
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:47,038
two,

three!

What the fuck?

764
01:15:56,427 --> 01:16:00,636
It doesn't even work!
It doesn't even fucking work!

765
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:02,213
What the fuck?

766
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,977
It doesn't make any fucking sense.

767
01:16:19,742 --> 01:16:21,858
I think I know what it does.

768
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:40,168
Get used to me,
'cause I'm not going anywhere.

769
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:42,002
You sure about that?

770
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:48,846
Amanda will fail you.

771
01:16:50,773 --> 01:16:51,888

Lynn!

I know it's your birthday.

Come on, let's go.

<i>But I can assure you,</i>

Miss Tuck, what's in the box?

815
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:31,758
Please. Please forgive me.

816
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:34,419
Have mercy, please!

817
01:21:34,515 --> 01:21:38,099
Did he show mercy
when my husband was suffering?

818
01:21:44,358 --> 01:21:46,565
John left you five envelopes.

819
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:49,560
The sixth one was for me.

820
01:21:54,785 --> 01:21:56,571
This is John's will.

821
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:02,197
...<i>to watch this horror!</i>

822
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:05,625
- He had no choice!
- He always had a choice!

823
01:22:07,548 --> 01:22:11,712
The reason I am doing this
isn't because I can't forgive you

824
01:22:11,802 --> 01:22:13,793
for what you did to me.

825
01:22:15,472 --> 01:22:17,713
The reason I'm doing this

826
01:22:17,808 --> 01:22:21,972
is because I couldn't forgive myself
for what you might do to someone else.

827
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:24,390
Please, no. Please.

828
01:22:25,691 --> 01:22:28,228
- You will never kill again.
- Please.

829
01:22:30,821 --> 01:22:31,981
Please.

Please. Please.

833
01:22:42,416 --> 01:22:44,873
I can't. I can't kill him.

834
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:51,505
But I can.

835
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:55,675
- No, Brent!
- You killed my father, you motherfucker!

836
01:23:00,517 --> 01:23:02,303
Now you burn in hell.

837
01:23:30,797 --> 01:23:32,128
Game over.

838
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:41,630
- John Kramer.
- William Easton.

839
01:23:41,725 --> 01:23:42,714
Nice to meet you.

840
01:23:51,902 --> 01:23:54,860
- Those are the rules, Harold.
- You've just given me a death sentence.

841
01:23:54,947 --> 01:23:58,235
So, in a sense,
you choose who lives or dies.

842
01:24:04,915 --> 01:24:06,155
No!

843
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:09,162
It's policy, John. It's policy.

844
01:24:15,175 --> 01:24:19,794
You think it's the living
who will have ultimate judgment over you,

845
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:23,130
<i>because the dead will have no claim</i>
<i>over your soul,</i>

846
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:29,018
but you may be mistaken.

847
01:24:39,366 --> 01:24:40,947
So when's your test, Detective?

848
01:24:43,912 --> 01:24:46,028
- I don't need one.
- Oh, yeah?

849
01:24:54,214 --> 01:24:56,330
<i>You know why you're here, don't you?</i>

850
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:04,088
I want to know
if you have what it takes to survive.

851
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:07,599
<i>You feel you now have control, don't you?</i>

852
01:25:07,686 --> 01:25:10,723
<i>You think you will walk away untested</i>.

853
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:28,237
Do you like how brutality feels, Mark?

854
01:25:30,167 --> 01:25:32,328
I'm only carrying out John's final request.

855
01:25:32,919 --> 01:25:35,251
You want a chance? I'll give you a chance.

856
01:31:12,926 --> 01:31:14,211
Remember...

857
01:31:15,261 --> 01:31:16,626
Remember...

858
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:25,348
Remember, don't trust
the one who saves you.

859
01:31:27,857 --> 01:31:30,314
Don't trust the one who saves you.
