1
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm exploring the fascinating world of plants,

2
00:00:15,069 --> 00:00:18,388
from the most bizarre to the most beautiful.

3
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:26,893
I will be using today's latest technology

4
00:00:26,945 --> 00:00:31,209
to reveal a whole new dimension in the lives of plants.

5
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,674
I'll trace them from their beginnings on land

6
00:00:37,743 --> 00:00:40,715
to their vital place in nature today...

7
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,589
..and discover a hidden world

8
00:00:50,648 --> 00:00:53,118
that, only too often, we overlook.

9
00:01:04,496 --> 00:01:08,624
We'll move from our time scale to theirs.

10
00:01:14,204 --> 00:01:16,562
We will explore the extraordinary ways

11
00:01:16,597 --> 00:01:20,666
by which some plants survive in the harshest conditions.

12
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,563
And we will do all this in one unique place,

13
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:30,889
a microcosm of the whole plant world,

14
00:01:33,213 --> 00:01:36,701
the Royal Botanic Gardens of Kew.

15
00:01:41,984 --> 00:01:49,606
Kingdom of Plants with David Attenborough

16
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,727
I've seen plants growing in their natural habitats

17
00:01:59,865 --> 00:02:01,370
all over the world.

18
00:02:01,557 --> 00:02:02,991
But here in Kew,

19
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,454
it's possible to examine them in a way 

20
00:02:05,455 --> 00:02:08,225
that is impossible in the wild.

21
00:02:08,618 --> 00:02:12,856
Here, some 90% of all known plant species

22
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:16,054
are represented in one form or another.

23
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,293
So, in this one place,

24
00:02:18,464 --> 00:02:21,337
you can survey the entire plant kingdom,

25
00:02:21,405 --> 00:02:22,517
and what is more,

26
00:02:22,755 --> 00:02:24,601
using 3D cameras,

27
00:02:24,635 --> 00:02:28,107
reveal some of its most intimate secrets.

28
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:42,118
Life in the Wet Zone

29
00:02:42,553 --> 00:02:44,985
Plants flourish most dramatically 

30
00:02:44,986 --> 00:02:48,815
in places where there is a lot of warmth and a lot of water -

31
00:02:49,354 --> 00:02:50,675
the wet zone.

32
00:02:52,448 --> 00:02:57,088
So here we can discover how plants first established themselves on land

33
00:02:57,192 --> 00:03:01,484
to become the very foundation of all terrestrial life.

34
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:07,330
Rainforests occupy only about

35
00:03:07,434 --> 00:03:09,535
2% of the world's land surface,

36
00:03:09,536 --> 00:03:10,892
but they contain

37
00:03:10,996 --> 00:03:14,333
over 50% of the world's species.

38
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:17,032
And many of these wet zone plants

39
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:19,657
have extraordinary survival strategies.

40
00:03:19,796 --> 00:03:23,445
And to study them, Kew has built a rainforest

41
00:03:23,446 --> 00:03:25,757
here on the banks of Thames.

42
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:34,070
This is a rainforest like no other.

43
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:39,597
The Palm House was constructed in 1844

44
00:03:39,718 --> 00:03:42,091
from over 200 tons of iron

45
00:03:42,168 --> 00:03:45,580
and 16,000 panes of glass.

46
00:03:49,578 --> 00:03:53,088
No one had ever built a glass house on this scale before

47
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,835
and to do so, the architects borrowed techniques

48
00:03:55,851 --> 00:03:57,934
from the ship building industry,

49
00:03:58,256 --> 00:04:00,741
which may explain why the Palm House

50
00:04:00,984 --> 00:04:04,356
looks like the upturned hull of a ship.

51
00:04:06,337 --> 00:04:10,404
Its purpose was to provide a home for the tropical plants

52
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,102
that Victorian explorers brought back

53
00:04:13,103 --> 00:04:15,501
from their adventures in the tropics.

54
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,936
It was an engineering wonder of the age.

55
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,823
And it is still a botanical wonder.

56
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:36,544
Most of the plants at this end of the house

57
00:04:36,545 --> 00:04:37,675
are kept in pots

58
00:04:37,757 --> 00:04:40,616
as they would have been in Victorian times.

59
00:04:41,016 --> 00:04:43,475
And this is almost certainly

60
00:04:43,545 --> 00:04:46,203
the oldest pot plant in the world.

61
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:50,075
This is Encephalartos altensteinii.

62
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:54,440
and it came here in 1775.

63
00:05:00,773 --> 00:05:03,175
Altensteinii has since been joined

64
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:07,106
by a multitude of other wet zone plants.

65
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:17,481
Together they constitute a unique global rainforest,

66
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:18,911
a living laboratory

67
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:22,272
where we can watch and observe the fascinating ways

68
00:05:22,342 --> 00:05:26,758
in which rainforest plants interact and behave.

69
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,865
Conditions in this glass house are near perfect

70
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:35,523
for wet zone plants.

71
00:05:35,592 --> 00:05:36,754
It's warm,

72
00:05:36,892 --> 00:05:37,952
it's humid,

73
00:05:38,294 --> 00:05:39,593
there's plenty of light,

74
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:42,823
and as a consequence, plants grow very rapidly

75
00:05:42,978 --> 00:05:44,499
and all through the year.

76
00:05:50,722 --> 00:05:52,688
If you speed up time,

77
00:05:52,859 --> 00:05:55,765
plants begin to reveal their true nature.

78
00:05:59,508 --> 00:06:02,586
They are not passive organisms as you might think,

79
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,449
but competitive creatures,

80
00:06:04,483 --> 00:06:07,748
every bit is aggressive as animals,

81
00:06:11,577 --> 00:06:15,236
they are locked in a desperate battle for light and space.

82
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,425
They stretch and pulse

83
00:06:19,442 --> 00:06:23,322
as they strive to barge their way into pole position.

84
00:06:28,484 --> 00:06:30,866
Creepers and vines reach around

85
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:33,406
for the branch or the stem of another plant

86
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:35,665
on which to hitch a ride.

87
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:54,315
Bamboos, a family of giant grasses,

88
00:06:54,418 --> 00:06:57,153
are capable of extraordinary speeds

89
00:06:57,187 --> 00:07:00,863
as they race towards the mightiest light of the top of the canopy.

90
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,214
They are the fastest growing of all plants.

91
00:07:14,453 --> 00:07:17,172
Some species can grow a whole meter

92
00:07:17,224 --> 00:07:18,795
in a single day.

93
00:07:21,685 --> 00:07:23,702
And at 30 meters tall,

94
00:07:23,804 --> 00:07:26,420
as high as a nine-storey office building,

95
00:07:26,505 --> 00:07:30,758
they can compete with the tallest rainforest trees.

96
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,284
The one resource wet zone plants don't need to fight for

97
00:07:48,336 --> 00:07:49,584
is water.

98
00:07:53,943 --> 00:07:54,747
In fact,

99
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:57,549
there can be so much rain in the rainforest

100
00:07:57,584 --> 00:08:00,438
that some species have to have special ways

101
00:08:00,508 --> 00:08:01,739
of getting rid of it.

102
00:08:08,492 --> 00:08:11,210
This is the taro plant

103
00:08:11,295 --> 00:08:14,441
and it has the most extraordinary leaves.

104
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:20,389
What would happen when I pour water on them?

105
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:29,792
The water rolls,

106
00:08:30,578 --> 00:08:33,279
leaving the leaf behind almost dry.

107
00:08:34,117 --> 00:08:35,483
And that's because the leaf

108
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:39,844
is covered with very, very tiny microscopic structures

109
00:08:39,963 --> 00:08:43,228
which hold aloft the droplets of water.

110
00:08:44,237 --> 00:08:48,118
And as a consequence, only about 2% of water

111
00:08:48,204 --> 00:08:51,229
touches the actual leaf surface itself.

112
00:08:51,571 --> 00:08:54,306
And as the droplets roll away,

113
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,589
they carry with them the dirt and bacteria,

114
00:08:57,777 --> 00:09:00,853
so, in effect, these leaves are self-cleaning.

115
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,410
But there are some plants that use water

116
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,290
in a different way

117
00:09:15,094 --> 00:09:17,869
and they leave high up in the canopy.

118
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,197
A tank bromeliad,

119
00:09:23,334 --> 00:09:26,428
a plant that is dispensed with the need of growing

120
00:09:26,497 --> 00:09:28,104
in the soil on the ground,

121
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,650
and instead attaches itself

122
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:33,489
to branches up here in the canopy

123
00:09:33,591 --> 00:09:34,941
where there is plenty of light.

124
00:09:35,489 --> 00:09:38,002
And since it's so far from the ground,

125
00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:42,258
it has had to develop a technique of collecting its nutriment

126
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,412
in a quite different way.

127
00:09:50,669 --> 00:09:52,690
They collect some of the rain

128
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:56,910
in everyday drenches in South American rainforest where they live.

129
00:10:02,516 --> 00:10:04,858
Their leaves, which are very broad,

130
00:10:04,994 --> 00:10:08,099
channel the rain water into a central reservoir.

131
00:10:13,885 --> 00:10:14,944
At their base,

132
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:17,234
the leaves are so tightly pressed together

133
00:10:17,286 --> 00:10:20,090
that the tank they create is watertight.

134
00:10:22,312 --> 00:10:26,398
Some species can hold up to 50 liters of liquid.

135
00:10:28,467 --> 00:10:31,851
The water not only hydrates the plant,

136
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,330
but it also provides a home

137
00:10:34,483 --> 00:10:38,246
for a lot of creatures that wouldn't otherwise be able to live up here.

138
00:10:40,895 --> 00:10:42,553
These little wrigglers

139
00:10:42,655 --> 00:10:44,655
are the larvae of mosquitoes.

140
00:10:47,117 --> 00:10:49,698
In the wild, there are lots of different creatures

141
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:52,280
that can be found in these little pools.

142
00:10:56,705 --> 00:11:00,159
This is Ranitomeya imitator,

143
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,330
a poison dart frog from Peru.

144
00:11:10,826 --> 00:11:12,895
It's the size of a thumb nail

145
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,020
and the only monogamous amphibian in the world.

146
00:11:21,204 --> 00:11:24,571
Some individuals spend their whole lives,

147
00:11:24,622 --> 00:11:28,759
from tadpole to adult, in and around bromeliad pools.

148
00:11:34,418 --> 00:11:35,957
And high in the canopy,

149
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:38,692
such a pool provides an excellent home.

150
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:43,667
It's relatively safe

151
00:11:45,017 --> 00:11:47,769
and there is a ready supply of food.

152
00:11:49,257 --> 00:11:51,682
The plant benefits from the arrangement

153
00:11:51,736 --> 00:11:54,743
because the droppings produced by its lodger

154
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:57,668
are a nutritious fertilizer.

155
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,142
Bromeliads and the frogs that live in them

156
00:12:05,275 --> 00:12:08,591
are only one example of the complex relationships

157
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:11,134
that are bound in the rainforests.

158
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,547
In tropical forests,

159
00:12:16,582 --> 00:12:19,112
the lives of every living thing,

160
00:12:19,146 --> 00:12:20,855
both animal and plant,

161
00:12:21,077 --> 00:12:23,248
are intimately entwined.

162
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,386
It's a tangled web

163
00:12:27,575 --> 00:12:30,856
that has evolved over many millions of years.

164
00:12:33,554 --> 00:12:34,922
Throughout the history,

165
00:12:35,229 --> 00:12:38,545
rainforests have provided plants with a refuge

166
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,862
against harsher conditions elsewhere in the planet.

167
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,643
So in rainforests,

168
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,717
you'll find some very ancient plant families.

169
00:12:47,316 --> 00:12:50,872
This cycad, for example, belongs to a family

170
00:12:51,008 --> 00:12:54,821
that certainly provided food for the dinosaurs.

171
00:13:06,754 --> 00:13:09,677
But the rainforest is such a rich environment

172
00:13:09,882 --> 00:13:12,855
that plants of all state in their history

173
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,565
can still be found here.

174
00:13:27,627 --> 00:13:31,250
The first was slimy thread-like algae

175
00:13:31,405 --> 00:13:33,405
that emerged from rivers and swamps

176
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,123
to grow on the wet muddy margins.

177
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,372
40 million years or so later,

178
00:13:45,581 --> 00:13:48,054
some developed watertight coverings

179
00:13:48,123 --> 00:13:52,538
that enabled them to move on to try those still moist land.

180
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,322
They were the liverworts

181
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,773
and the mosses.

182
00:14:16,596 --> 00:14:20,217
Later still, some of the descendents of those plants

183
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,833
stiffen their stems

184
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,935
so that they were able to stand upright

185
00:14:23,953 --> 00:14:26,247
as they reached up towards the light.

186
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,801
They were the ferns and horsetails.

187
00:14:40,973 --> 00:14:43,214
This greening of the earth

188
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,369
changed the course of life

189
00:14:45,527 --> 00:14:48,139
allowing animals to follow plants

190
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:50,363
out of permanent water.

191
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,268
As they spread across the land,

192
00:15:02,447 --> 00:15:05,732
the plants pumped out oxygen from their leaves.

193
00:15:06,045 --> 00:15:07,887
So from the very beginning,

194
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,824
land animals were dependent upon plants

195
00:15:11,137 --> 00:15:12,580
not only for food,

196
00:15:12,632 --> 00:15:15,135
but for the very air they breathe.

197
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,212
A major difficulty for plants in their new environment

198
00:15:22,265 --> 00:15:23,951
was reproduction.

199
00:15:25,706 --> 00:15:28,244
If they were to produce fertile seeds,

200
00:15:28,383 --> 00:15:29,957
pollen from one had to reach

201
00:15:29,974 --> 00:15:31,552
and fertilize the ova,

202
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,567
the eggs of another.

203
00:15:35,913 --> 00:15:38,903
Conifers - pines, yews and firs -

204
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,370
then, as now, used wind.

205
00:15:44,186 --> 00:15:46,799
They produced vast numbers of pollen grains,

206
00:15:46,815 --> 00:15:49,631
scarcely bigger than particles of dust,

207
00:15:49,735 --> 00:15:53,003
which the wind could carry for hundreds of miles.

208
00:15:55,175 --> 00:15:57,000
The technique was successful

209
00:15:57,052 --> 00:15:58,703
but very wasteful.

210
00:16:00,603 --> 00:16:03,643
Immense quantities of pollen grains had to be produced

211
00:16:03,766 --> 00:16:06,460
if just one was to reach its target.

212
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:15,328
But then, about 140 million years ago,

213
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:19,291
some developed a much more efficient way of doing that -

214
00:16:23,845 --> 00:16:25,547
with flowers.

215
00:16:33,898 --> 00:16:36,377
How this happened was, for a long time,

216
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:39,120
a total mystery to scientists,

217
00:16:40,241 --> 00:16:42,196
including one of the greatest.

218
00:16:43,256 --> 00:16:45,771
Charles Darwin was baffled

219
00:16:45,832 --> 00:16:48,948
by what he called "an abominable mystery".

220
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:52,978
The fact that, half way through the age of dinosaurs,

221
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:57,492
flowering plants suddenly produced a vast number of species

222
00:16:57,493 --> 00:17:00,433
and within a very short period of time.

223
00:17:00,902 --> 00:17:04,231
That contradicted one of the characteristics of evolution

224
00:17:04,246 --> 00:17:05,473
as Darwin thought

225
00:17:05,518 --> 00:17:08,443
that it was a slow and gradual process.

226
00:17:09,276 --> 00:17:11,109
How could that happen?

227
00:17:12,337 --> 00:17:15,155
From the moment Darwin posed the question,

228
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,786
scientists have been striving for an answer.

229
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:25,619
Recent fossil discoveries

230
00:17:25,634 --> 00:17:29,665
and modern DNA analysis of species present and past

231
00:17:29,781 --> 00:17:33,872
have transformed our understanding of this fascinating period.

232
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,129
Using that information,

233
00:17:38,205 --> 00:17:41,478
scientists with work pioneered here in Kew

234
00:17:41,614 --> 00:17:45,336
have been able to construct the ancestral tree

235
00:17:45,442 --> 00:17:47,730
of whole of plant life.

236
00:17:55,831 --> 00:17:57,967
It begins with algae,

237
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,891
the simplest of the plants,

238
00:17:59,982 --> 00:18:02,422
which are followed by the mosses.

239
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:07,977
The thickness of the rising branches

240
00:18:07,992 --> 00:18:10,416
indicates the growth of number of species

241
00:18:10,492 --> 00:18:12,689
in each individual group.

242
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:20,532
For the first half of the plant's evolutionary history,

243
00:18:20,593 --> 00:18:24,684
all the branches of plant life flourished roughly equally.

244
00:18:29,366 --> 00:18:32,881
But then, 140 million years ago,

245
00:18:33,063 --> 00:18:36,285
there was an explosive radiation of species -

246
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,709
Darwin's mystery.

247
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,779
These were the angiosperms -

248
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,522
flowering plants.

249
00:18:56,885 --> 00:19:00,173
Their evolution was more gradual than Darwin had thought,

250
00:19:00,249 --> 00:19:01,687
but there is no question

251
00:19:01,749 --> 00:19:05,668
that the angiosperms quickly became the dominant group.

252
00:19:11,471 --> 00:19:15,047
They diversified to a huge range of species

253
00:19:15,168 --> 00:19:20,132
which have occupied almost every known habitat on earth.

254
00:19:22,648 --> 00:19:26,420
But what happened to stimulate this dramatic radiation?

255
00:19:27,981 --> 00:19:31,860
There was a happy coincidence of two events.

256
00:19:32,385 --> 00:19:36,566
The first was a doubling in the genetic material of plants,

257
00:19:36,582 --> 00:19:41,097
allowing them to evolve more quickly when their environment changed

258
00:19:43,879 --> 00:19:46,521
The second was one such change -

259
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:51,743
the development of the unique relationship between plants and animals.

260
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:02,420
The effect of this coincidence

261
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,359
can be seen in one of the very first flowering plants to evolve.

262
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:17,202
This is the Water Lily House,

263
00:20:17,203 --> 00:20:20,754
the hottest and most humid environment in Kew.

264
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,378
It was built in 1852

265
00:20:23,465 --> 00:20:26,906
to accommodate the latest botanical discovery -

266
00:20:26,924 --> 00:20:29,774
the giant Amazon water lily.

267
00:20:30,457 --> 00:20:34,419
Now, it's February and the pond is almost bare.

268
00:20:34,663 --> 00:20:35,861
But in a few weeks,

269
00:20:35,897 --> 00:20:38,486
exotic water lily of all kinds

270
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:39,789
will be sprouting.

271
00:20:49,979 --> 00:20:52,499
The ancestors of today's water lilies,

272
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,290
as we know from their fossils,

273
00:20:54,411 --> 00:20:58,235
were among the first plants to produce flowers.

274
00:21:27,292 --> 00:21:30,281
Bright petals, modified leaves

275
00:21:30,368 --> 00:21:34,035
were an advancement to flying insects.

276
00:21:34,313 --> 00:21:38,132
They signal the presence of highly nutritious pollen.

277
00:21:38,849 --> 00:21:41,681
The shape of the flower work like a primitive trap

278
00:21:41,682 --> 00:21:44,150
forcing the insects to stumble about

279
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:47,544
and bumping to the flower's reproductive structures.

280
00:21:48,569 --> 00:21:49,646
In doing so,

281
00:21:49,664 --> 00:21:52,626
the insects transferred onto the water lily

282
00:21:52,631 --> 00:21:54,739
pollen which they accidentally collected 

283
00:21:54,774 --> 00:21:57,260
on earlier visits to other flowers.

284
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,984
So now plants could trick insects

285
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:04,859
into transporting their pollen directly from one plant to another

286
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:07,919
with a door-to-door service.

287
00:22:09,969 --> 00:22:14,319
The flower of the giant Amazon water lily can close totally,

288
00:22:14,423 --> 00:22:17,378
holding the insects captive for several hours,

289
00:22:17,431 --> 00:22:21,792
thus making absolutely sure that pollination occurs.

290
00:22:26,815 --> 00:22:30,071
Many different species of plant followed suit,

291
00:22:30,105 --> 00:22:32,815
each evolving its own particular flowers

292
00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:35,249
to attract its insect messengers.

293
00:22:37,944 --> 00:22:39,872
Competition for their services

294
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,676
drove the plants to diversify.

295
00:22:45,689 --> 00:22:49,493
Insects favored petals that were brighter,

296
00:22:51,195 --> 00:22:53,682
scent that was more perfume,

297
00:22:57,117 --> 00:22:59,741
and flowers that had the sweetest nectar.

298
00:23:04,847 --> 00:23:07,305
The appearance of such temptations

299
00:23:07,376 --> 00:23:09,729
had a huge effect on the insects.

300
00:23:16,209 --> 00:23:18,573
They, too, began to diversify.

301
00:23:18,603 --> 00:23:20,996
A multitude of forms could better harness

302
00:23:20,997 --> 00:23:23,906
the potential of the numerous species of flower.

303
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:33,401
Insects with large eyes could spot the flowers,

304
00:23:36,972 --> 00:23:40,669
powerful wings could carry them between plants,

305
00:23:46,017 --> 00:23:50,729
and complex mouth parts could delve into the deepest nectary.

306
00:24:01,709 --> 00:24:04,526
So plants and insects evolved together

307
00:24:04,552 --> 00:24:07,476
driving their mutual diversity.

308
00:24:11,461 --> 00:24:14,825
Rainforests are the combination of this process,

309
00:24:14,885 --> 00:24:17,506
containing a greater variety of species

310
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:19,431
than any other habitat.

311
00:24:21,789 --> 00:24:23,647
And here you can see

312
00:24:24,092 --> 00:24:28,638
that some plants didn't restrict themselves to insects.

313
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:32,880
This, for example, is known as the jade vine.

314
00:24:33,057 --> 00:24:37,511
But why is it this extraordinary mesmerizing blue-green color?

315
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,738
Well, we know that it is fertilized by bats.

316
00:24:40,844 --> 00:24:43,678
That's why the flowers hang out in the open,

317
00:24:43,693 --> 00:24:46,572
so bats can get up them quite easily.

318
00:24:47,188 --> 00:24:48,591
And so maybe

319
00:24:48,834 --> 00:24:51,294
this color stands out particularly boldly,

320
00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:54,415
as bats are concerned, in the moonlight.

321
00:25:08,334 --> 00:25:09,910
When the bat arrives,

322
00:25:10,001 --> 00:25:13,046
it stick its head into the flower to get the honey

323
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:16,152
and as it does so and presses there,

324
00:25:16,495 --> 00:25:17,950
out from this hook,

325
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:22,177
come the stamens and dab pollen on its back.

326
00:25:22,344 --> 00:25:23,889
So when the bat goes away,

327
00:25:24,026 --> 00:25:26,995
it takes the pollen to another flower.

328
00:25:31,077 --> 00:25:33,667
Each and every species of flowering plant

329
00:25:33,702 --> 00:25:36,334
has its own unique evolutionary story

330
00:25:36,385 --> 00:25:39,626
that's closely coupled with the animals that pollinated.

331
00:25:41,684 --> 00:25:44,235
But one family of flowering plant

332
00:25:44,389 --> 00:25:47,621
has developed this relationship in more complex ways

333
00:25:47,651 --> 00:25:48,928
than any other

334
00:25:49,864 --> 00:25:51,030
and, in doing so,

335
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:55,351
has become the most numerous and diverse on the planet.

336
00:25:59,855 --> 00:26:04,033
There are an estimated 25,000 species

337
00:26:04,111 --> 00:26:05,393
of orchid.

338
00:26:13,602 --> 00:26:17,791
This family had a particular fascination for Charles Darwin

339
00:26:17,823 --> 00:26:21,961
as he reveals in one of his letters that is kept here in Kew.

340
00:26:23,337 --> 00:26:23,978
He says,

341
00:26:24,145 --> 00:26:28,504
"I have been extremely much interested with Catasetum",

342
00:26:28,632 --> 00:26:29,799
that's an orchid,

343
00:26:30,151 --> 00:26:33,833
"and indeed with many exotic orchids.

344
00:26:33,918 --> 00:26:35,797
"Orchids have interested me

345
00:26:35,812 --> 00:26:39,509
"as much as almost anything in my life."

346
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:41,585
Charles Darwin.

347
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:49,023
One species of these amazing plants

348
00:26:49,085 --> 00:26:51,282
can be found growing outside

349
00:26:51,413 --> 00:26:53,064
in the grounds of Kew.

350
00:26:57,746 --> 00:27:01,701
Orchids are extraordinary plants from many points of view.

351
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:03,140
But one of them

352
00:27:03,277 --> 00:27:06,953
is that the lower lip of the flower

353
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:10,241
is controlled by a special set of genes.

354
00:27:10,574 --> 00:27:14,938
So that means that it can evolve and change its shape and color

355
00:27:15,105 --> 00:27:18,544
while the rest of its petals remain the same.

356
00:27:20,463 --> 00:27:22,690
The lower lip of this little orchid

357
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:26,478
has evolved to look roughly like a bee.

358
00:27:27,327 --> 00:27:30,584
And people used to think that was a kind of warning

359
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,827
to warn cows not to eat it

360
00:27:32,872 --> 00:27:36,033
on the grounds that they wouldn't want to get stung on the tongue.

361
00:27:36,094 --> 00:27:38,124
Now we know that's not the case.

362
00:27:38,185 --> 00:27:42,624
This is a mimic of a female bee

363
00:27:42,791 --> 00:27:45,680
that's attracting a male to mate it

364
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:49,104
and when the male mates, it will pollinate the flower.

365
00:27:50,149 --> 00:27:51,998
How do we know that's true?

366
00:27:52,165 --> 00:27:55,240
Because this little flower produces the scent

367
00:27:55,392 --> 00:28:00,149
which is exactly the same as that of a female bee

368
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:02,538
trying to attract a mate.

369
00:28:05,174 --> 00:28:07,779
The unique genetic make-up of orchids

370
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:12,265
has allowed them to evolve an almost unbelievable degree of complexity.

371
00:28:14,472 --> 00:28:17,775
And they produce their greatest variety and complexity

372
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,760
in the wet zone.

373
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,997
At Kew,

374
00:28:26,194 --> 00:28:29,876
they are cultivated inside the Princess of Wales Conservatory.

375
00:28:33,982 --> 00:28:37,740
In this section, conditions are perfect for them.

376
00:29:04,032 --> 00:29:06,244
Each orchid species

377
00:29:06,365 --> 00:29:09,578
has its own characteristic form and color. 

378
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,825
They represent the pinnacle of evolutionary cooperation

379
00:29:28,885 --> 00:29:31,597
between animals and plants.

380
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,011
In their most extreme form,

381
00:29:51,102 --> 00:29:54,602
the relationship for the plant is an exclusive one.

382
00:29:54,723 --> 00:29:58,102
Only one species of insect would have the right equipment

383
00:29:58,178 --> 00:30:00,102
to claim the plant's nectar.

384
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:11,188
This relationship between a particular kind of insect

385
00:30:11,263 --> 00:30:13,385
and a particular kind of plant

386
00:30:13,551 --> 00:30:16,930
produces some extraordinary results.

387
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,091
This, for example, is Darwin's favorite orchid -

388
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:21,243
Catasetum.

389
00:30:25,197 --> 00:30:26,788
Unusually for orchids,

390
00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:30,137
some plants are male and others are female.

391
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:34,783
This is a male.

392
00:30:37,647 --> 00:30:40,570
It produces a kind of scent

393
00:30:40,601 --> 00:30:43,192
that attracts just one species of

394
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:46,687
small, blowsy and beautifully colored bee.

395
00:30:47,217 --> 00:30:51,444
The bee lands on the lip of the orchid

396
00:30:51,702 --> 00:30:56,429
and thrust its head into the orchid's flower itself.

397
00:30:57,414 --> 00:30:59,439
And that touches a trigger

398
00:31:00,863 --> 00:31:04,000
and sticks onto the bee's back

399
00:31:04,076 --> 00:31:05,879
this extraordinary thing,

400
00:31:05,894 --> 00:31:07,318
which is, in fact,

401
00:31:07,394 --> 00:31:11,015
a bundle of pollen grains called "pollinia".

402
00:31:12,585 --> 00:31:15,328
This has a little cap on it,

403
00:31:16,282 --> 00:31:18,813
which, after a minute or so, folds off

404
00:31:19,025 --> 00:31:20,978
and reveals there -

405
00:31:21,025 --> 00:31:25,161
that little horseshoe shaped bundle of pollen grains.

406
00:31:28,717 --> 00:31:32,004
High speed cameras can show us the trigger mechanism

407
00:31:33,595 --> 00:31:37,156
The pollinia accelerates with great force

408
00:31:39,469 --> 00:31:42,348
and so ensures it sticks firmly

409
00:31:42,408 --> 00:31:44,272
onto the insect's back.

410
00:31:46,226 --> 00:31:48,892
The bee loads out some of these,

411
00:31:48,984 --> 00:31:50,317
flies away,

412
00:31:50,393 --> 00:31:53,181
and maybe thinks it's not going to do that again,

413
00:31:53,251 --> 00:31:55,312
but is nonetheless attracted

414
00:31:55,433 --> 00:31:57,615
to another rather different looking flower,

415
00:31:57,691 --> 00:31:58,888
which is the female,

416
00:31:59,161 --> 00:32:01,994
but which produces just that sort of scent.

417
00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:04,100
And it sticks it's head

418
00:32:04,342 --> 00:32:06,100
into the female flower

419
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,549
and this little bundle of pollen,

420
00:32:08,731 --> 00:32:12,913
like a key, fits into a little aperture like a lock

421
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,064
and it pulls off the pollen

422
00:32:15,413 --> 00:32:18,731
and leaves on the bee's back a little bundle.

423
00:32:19,574 --> 00:32:21,226
And lo and behold -

424
00:32:21,589 --> 00:32:23,650
pollination has been achieved.

425
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,241
It's hard to imagine how evolution produce

426
00:32:31,256 --> 00:32:34,074
such a complex pollination mechanism.

427
00:32:38,281 --> 00:32:39,675
But there is one orchid

428
00:32:39,842 --> 00:32:43,448
whose life story is even more astonishing.

429
00:32:46,054 --> 00:32:49,367
Many flowers produce a sweet nectar

430
00:32:49,397 --> 00:32:53,988
to entice insects and other animals to come and pollinate.

431
00:32:54,594 --> 00:32:57,458
But this orchid from Madagascar,

432
00:32:57,897 --> 00:32:59,427
the Comet Orchid,

433
00:32:59,539 --> 00:33:00,791
carries its nectar

434
00:33:00,792 --> 00:33:06,119
at the end of extremely long spurs in back of its flower.

435
00:33:12,271 --> 00:33:14,917
What on earth could have a tongue long enough

436
00:33:14,932 --> 00:33:18,508
to reach down those huge long spurs?

437
00:33:18,841 --> 00:33:22,023
Charles Darwin who studied the fertilization of orchids

438
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:24,902
decided it could only be a moth,

439
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:27,068
but nobody had ever seen it.

440
00:33:27,326 --> 00:33:30,053
Until some years after his death,

441
00:33:30,215 --> 00:33:31,760
it was proved right.

442
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:46,474
This is Xanthopan morganii praedicta,

443
00:33:47,947 --> 00:33:51,166
Morgan's predicted Sphinx moth.

444
00:33:56,372 --> 00:33:58,493
With special night-vision cameras,

445
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:02,856
we can show why a such an immensely long tongue is needed.

446
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:09,998
It's a third of a meter long,

447
00:34:12,764 --> 00:34:17,446
exactly the same length as the spur beneath the flower.

448
00:34:37,538 --> 00:34:41,065
The relationship between orchids and their insect pollinators

449
00:34:41,087 --> 00:34:43,538
is certainly very intimate,

450
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:47,879
but the connection between these passion flowers and butterflies

451
00:34:47,912 --> 00:34:50,307
is even more complex.

452
00:34:57,864 --> 00:34:59,919
This is Passiflora -

453
00:35:00,073 --> 00:35:01,809
the passion vine.

454
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,662
Like orchids,

455
00:35:12,729 --> 00:35:16,455
its brightly colored displays attract pollinators.

456
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:26,056
One of them is a Heliconiinae butterfly.

457
00:35:28,484 --> 00:35:31,561
But this relationship between the insect and the plant

458
00:35:31,693 --> 00:35:34,195
is not straightforward trade off.

459
00:35:35,118 --> 00:35:37,657
Passion vine and butterfly have been engaged

460
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:40,635
in an ongoing game of one-upmanship

461
00:35:40,657 --> 00:35:42,899
for many millions of years.

462
00:35:46,082 --> 00:35:48,708
The butterfly doesn't just want nectar.

463
00:35:51,632 --> 00:35:54,697
It also wants a place to lay its eggs,

464
00:36:01,288 --> 00:36:03,397
a place where its caterpillars

465
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:07,156
will have something good to eat immediately nearby -

466
00:36:09,628 --> 00:36:11,738
passion flower leaves.

467
00:36:18,647 --> 00:36:22,119
And its young have huge appetites.

468
00:36:41,498 --> 00:36:44,893
But some passion vines have fought back.

469
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:49,904
They have evolved a way to protect themselves -

470
00:36:52,563 --> 00:36:54,860
poison in their leaves.

471
00:37:00,395 --> 00:37:03,703
But sometimes even this is no defense.

472
00:37:08,128 --> 00:37:11,678
Some caterpillars not only tolerate the leaf's toxins,

473
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,194
but store them in their flesh.

474
00:37:16,062 --> 00:37:19,425
And now those toxin serve as a defence

475
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:21,931
against the caterpillar's predators.

476
00:37:30,389 --> 00:37:33,169
And the story doesn't even end here.

477
00:37:36,386 --> 00:37:40,968
The passion vine has evolved a second line of defense.

478
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:47,265
This one has leaves that give impression of being a swarm of butterflies.

479
00:37:49,327 --> 00:37:51,031
By mimicking the real ones,

480
00:37:51,064 --> 00:37:54,899
it may be suggesting that there is no perching room for others.

481
00:38:00,214 --> 00:38:02,038
And in the details of their leaves,

482
00:38:02,049 --> 00:38:05,192
you can see something even more surprising.

483
00:38:07,049 --> 00:38:09,016
This kind of passion flower

484
00:38:09,126 --> 00:38:12,983
has a special way of dissuading female butterflies

485
00:38:12,994 --> 00:38:15,566
from laying their eggs on its leaves.

486
00:38:17,035 --> 00:38:20,617
It imitates eggs with these little yellow spots

487
00:38:20,705 --> 00:38:22,530
so that female butterflies will think

488
00:38:22,552 --> 00:38:25,892
that these leaves are already taken as you might say.

489
00:38:28,002 --> 00:38:30,639
And this different species of passion flower

490
00:38:30,801 --> 00:38:32,405
does the same thing

491
00:38:32,493 --> 00:38:34,900
but imitates eggs in a different way

492
00:38:35,131 --> 00:38:38,680
with tiny little posts at the base of the leaf.

493
00:38:47,204 --> 00:38:51,281
The passion flower's tactics illustrate some of the complex ways

494
00:38:51,292 --> 00:38:54,787
by which plants dissuade animals from raiding them.

495
00:38:58,146 --> 00:39:01,750
But some wet zone species have turned the tables.

496
00:39:07,575 --> 00:39:10,586
This bud will soon become a leaf.

497
00:39:14,628 --> 00:39:17,066
It's no ordinary leaf.

498
00:39:22,684 --> 00:39:26,654
It has a special all together more sinister purpose.

499
00:39:31,986 --> 00:39:34,216
This is Nepenthes,

500
00:39:34,326 --> 00:39:35,777
the pitcher plant.

501
00:39:40,543 --> 00:39:43,510
It grows in nutrient poor soils,

502
00:39:43,587 --> 00:39:47,433
so has to find nitrogen and minerals in another way.

503
00:39:52,573 --> 00:39:54,858
The leaf, just like a flower,

504
00:39:55,023 --> 00:39:58,001
attracts insects with a reward.

505
00:40:02,668 --> 00:40:04,745
The pitcher is colored and scented

506
00:40:04,773 --> 00:40:07,375
to appeal to flies looking for a meal

507
00:40:07,426 --> 00:40:09,567
of rotting flesh.

508
00:40:11,632 --> 00:40:14,952
The visitors are rewarded with a greasy substance

509
00:40:14,978 --> 00:40:17,414
on the underside of the pitcher's lid.

510
00:40:21,328 --> 00:40:23,841
But the plant wants something in return.

511
00:40:24,866 --> 00:40:26,019
Not pollen,

512
00:40:26,148 --> 00:40:27,277
but a meal.

513
00:40:32,088 --> 00:40:33,665
The lip of the pitcher

514
00:40:33,704 --> 00:40:37,140
in covered in tiny slippery ridges.

515
00:40:44,101 --> 00:40:47,486
Wax lubricates the surface further.

516
00:40:51,233 --> 00:40:53,490
It's extremely difficult to hold on

517
00:40:53,592 --> 00:40:55,016
even for a fly.

518
00:41:05,609 --> 00:41:08,032
Once inside, there is no escape.

519
00:41:13,058 --> 00:41:16,485
The leaf holds a pool of digestive liquid.

520
00:41:20,665 --> 00:41:24,203
This contains microscopic elastic pheromones

521
00:41:24,344 --> 00:41:27,075
which gives it the properties of quicksand.

522
00:41:28,053 --> 00:41:30,015
The more the insect struggles,

523
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,912
the deeper it sinks.

524
00:41:34,105 --> 00:41:37,374
Enzymes begin to dissolve the victim's body

525
00:41:37,566 --> 00:41:39,361
while it's still alive.

526
00:41:49,032 --> 00:41:52,570
Some pitchers aren't content with just insects.

527
00:41:52,993 --> 00:41:55,557
This one eats mice.

528
00:41:55,933 --> 00:41:59,869
The mice come along, perhaps attracted by the sweet nectar on the lip.

529
00:42:00,126 --> 00:42:01,241
They fall in.

530
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,561
They can't get a purchase to get out.

531
00:42:03,728 --> 00:42:04,920
They drown.

532
00:42:05,061 --> 00:42:08,728
And eventually, the enzymes in the pitcher's fluid

533
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:12,604
dissolve the body so that, eventually, there is nothing left

534
00:42:12,706 --> 00:42:15,514
but a bit of fur and bone.

535
00:42:21,762 --> 00:42:25,762
This pitcher is called Nepenthes lowii.

536
00:42:30,236 --> 00:42:34,493
It lives on the forested the slopes of Borneo's mountains.

537
00:42:35,108 --> 00:42:39,830
And it's perhaps the most extraordinary pitcher of them all.

538
00:42:40,779 --> 00:42:45,599
The evidence is that it too attracts small mammals.

539
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:52,215
It excretes a sort of nectar from the underside of the lid there

540
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:55,347
and that attracts little tree shrews.

541
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,937
This engaging animal

542
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:04,514
is Tupaia montana -

543
00:43:04,603 --> 00:43:06,838
the mountain tree shrew.

544
00:43:08,261 --> 00:43:12,364
It feeds on fruit and any insects it can find.

545
00:43:14,671 --> 00:43:17,710
It also visits pitcher plants.

546
00:43:24,009 --> 00:43:28,073
Until recently, what happens next was a mystery.

547
00:43:32,641 --> 00:43:36,346
This footage seems to show that the animal has found a way

548
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:39,577
of evading the slippery death trap.

549
00:43:42,064 --> 00:43:42,986
What is more,

550
00:43:43,051 --> 00:43:46,756
it's feeding on the underside of the pitcher's lid.

551
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,081
This pitcher doesn't get its nutriment from the bodies of dead animals.

552
00:43:58,312 --> 00:44:01,444
It's got another way of sustaining itself.

553
00:44:03,226 --> 00:44:04,969
The tree shrews come to lick it.

554
00:44:04,995 --> 00:44:06,072
When they do,

555
00:44:06,136 --> 00:44:09,188
their rear end is directly over the pitcher

556
00:44:09,393 --> 00:44:12,085
so that their droppings fall into it.

557
00:44:12,679 --> 00:44:17,333
And its that that provides this plant with its nourishment.

558
00:44:21,781 --> 00:44:23,589
It's even been suggest

559
00:44:23,721 --> 00:44:26,555
that that nectar contains a laxative

560
00:44:26,619 --> 00:44:30,247
to persuade the tree shrew to do just that.

561
00:44:54,524 --> 00:44:57,999
This ability of the rainforest environment over time

562
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:01,165
has allowed the co-evolution of animals and plants

563
00:45:01,204 --> 00:45:05,012
to develop to an unrivaled degree of complexity.

564
00:45:06,512 --> 00:45:08,229
But with complexity,

565
00:45:08,294 --> 00:45:10,221
comes fragility.

566
00:45:12,772 --> 00:45:15,400
Each and every species has its own place

567
00:45:15,413 --> 00:45:18,144
in the complex working of the rainforest.

568
00:45:21,391 --> 00:45:22,879
In recent years,

569
00:45:22,943 --> 00:45:26,879
Kew's unique position as a living laboratory of the wet zone

570
00:45:26,968 --> 00:45:29,712
has become more important than ever.

571
00:45:40,998 --> 00:45:45,242
These days, Kew's role extends far beyond these 300 acres.

572
00:45:45,421 --> 00:45:47,344
And here, people are working

573
00:45:47,408 --> 00:45:50,447
to rescue extremely rare plants.

574
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:52,438
from total extinction.

575
00:45:54,938 --> 00:45:57,617
The danger of losing a single species

576
00:45:57,694 --> 00:46:00,605
is taken very seriously indeed.

577
00:46:03,258 --> 00:46:05,134
Here in the Water Lily Room,

578
00:46:05,186 --> 00:46:07,711
experts face a desperate scramble

579
00:46:07,763 --> 00:46:11,198
to save one species from oblivion.

580
00:46:13,416 --> 00:46:16,314
Nestling amongst the giant water lily pads,

581
00:46:16,352 --> 00:46:19,789
is the tiny Nymphaea thermarum -

582
00:46:20,997 --> 00:46:23,305
the Rwandan water lily -

583
00:46:23,626 --> 00:46:27,446
the smallest and rarest water lily in the world.

584
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:32,467
Extinct in the wild,

585
00:46:32,544 --> 00:46:35,181
these precious few individuals

586
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:38,445
are some of the last remaining specimens.

587
00:46:40,566 --> 00:46:43,727
These photographs show its only known habitat

588
00:46:43,796 --> 00:46:46,683
as it was over 20 years ago -

589
00:46:46,947 --> 00:46:49,617
A hot spring in Rwanda.

590
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,958
It was destroyed just recently

591
00:46:54,617 --> 00:46:58,672
when locals redirected its waters to supply a laundry.

592
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:04,251
A single specimen was brought back to Europe,

593
00:47:04,328 --> 00:47:06,790
but the species remained on the blink.

594
00:47:08,955 --> 00:47:10,779
Its seeds would germinate,

595
00:47:10,966 --> 00:47:13,119
but the seedlings always died.

596
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:20,116
Then some seeds were given to this man at Kew -

597
00:47:20,512 --> 00:47:22,281
Carlos Magdalena.

598
00:47:24,827 --> 00:47:27,849
Known in Spain as "the Plant Messiah",

599
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,322
Carlos is famous for his great skill

600
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:33,036
in rescuing endangered species.

601
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:38,890
But even Carlos nearly met his match

602
00:47:38,912 --> 00:47:40,717
with this tiny plant.

603
00:47:44,176 --> 00:47:46,329
Like this did many different seedlings,

604
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:47,791
nothing seemed to work.

605
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:51,516
Well, that meant that the species is about to disappear forever?

606
00:47:51,527 --> 00:47:53,952
Exactly, that was very worrying for me.

607
00:47:53,963 --> 00:47:56,919
So I started becoming a little bit obsessed with it.

608
00:47:57,128 --> 00:47:59,018
And, yes.

609
00:47:59,425 --> 00:48:02,051
I mean yes, it is crazy, isn't it?

610
00:48:02,205 --> 00:48:04,249
To know that something that you can do or not

611
00:48:04,315 --> 00:48:06,612
can make a difference to a species.

612
00:48:11,982 --> 00:48:13,620
Carlos didn't give up.

613
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:17,905
He had one more unlikely idea.

614
00:48:19,726 --> 00:48:23,418
He tried growing the water lily out of water.

615
00:48:27,407 --> 00:48:30,067
This idea, growing water lily out of water,

616
00:48:30,089 --> 00:48:34,265
is something as crazy as to grow a cactus floating in a pond.

617
00:48:34,448 --> 00:48:37,118
So it was the last unlikely thing

618
00:48:37,129 --> 00:48:38,954
that logically you will do

619
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,281
and then these are the result.

620
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:44,371
Carlos' inspired idea

621
00:48:44,382 --> 00:48:48,756
was to make use of this plant's strange ecological quirk.

622
00:48:49,335 --> 00:48:52,742
Nearly all other water lilies only grow in deep water,

623
00:48:52,961 --> 00:48:55,247
but the Rwandan spring's very shallow,

624
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,423
little more than damp mud.

625
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:02,533
And so by growing it in pot above the water,

626
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:05,826
Carlos replicated its natural habitat.

627
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,925
Within a few short weeks,

628
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:11,847
there were 50 specimens,

629
00:49:11,914 --> 00:49:13,453
all set to flower.

630
00:49:15,757 --> 00:49:17,779
So this is a crucial moment

631
00:49:17,801 --> 00:49:20,054
because if this works

632
00:49:20,065 --> 00:49:22,306
and it's clearly going to,

633
00:49:22,801 --> 00:49:25,713
you have, in fact yourself, saved the species.

634
00:49:25,768 --> 00:49:27,801
If I didn't have this crazy idea,

635
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,578
the holy species will be gone forever.

636
00:49:43,388 --> 00:49:46,498
That's absolutely charming.

637
00:49:47,377 --> 00:49:48,344
Beautiful!

638
00:50:11,524 --> 00:50:14,821
In an environment with so many species

639
00:50:14,931 --> 00:50:17,183
and so many spectacular ones,

640
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,678
it might seem odd to spend so much trouble

641
00:50:19,788 --> 00:50:24,268
and try to save just one comparatively inconspicuous one.

642
00:50:24,697 --> 00:50:27,015
But the relationships within the rainforest

643
00:50:27,026 --> 00:50:29,576
are so complex and so extensive

644
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:31,488
that the loss of just one

645
00:50:31,576 --> 00:50:35,191
can have a whole series of unpredictable consequences.

646
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:37,521
The loss of a plant

647
00:50:37,818 --> 00:50:39,616
can mean the loss of an insect.

648
00:50:39,957 --> 00:50:43,507
The loss of an insect can mean that a bush loses its pollinator.

649
00:50:43,693 --> 00:50:47,858
The loss of the bush can mean that a mammal has lost its food plant.

650
00:50:48,188 --> 00:50:50,078
Nobody can say exactly

651
00:50:50,155 --> 00:50:53,393
when or if such things are gonna happen.

652
00:50:53,767 --> 00:50:54,910
But to me,

653
00:50:55,053 --> 00:50:57,294
preventing it from happening in the first place

654
00:50:57,525 --> 00:51:00,097
seems to make absolute sense.

655
00:51:06,467 --> 00:51:10,588
The story of plants spreads well beyond the wet zone.

656
00:51:13,544 --> 00:51:18,379
They have evolved to occupy almost every environment on the planet.

657
00:51:21,933 --> 00:51:25,240
They survive in regions of constant change,

658
00:51:29,232 --> 00:51:33,330
They thrive in soils that almost never see rain,

659
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,232
and, as we will discover,

660
00:51:39,437 --> 00:51:41,988
they do much of their living in ways

661
00:51:42,001 --> 00:51:46,744
that go almost entirely undetected by us.
