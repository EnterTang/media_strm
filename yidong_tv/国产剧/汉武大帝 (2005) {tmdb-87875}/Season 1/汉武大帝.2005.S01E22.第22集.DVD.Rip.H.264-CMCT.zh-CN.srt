00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,650
每个人都认同 一年中最重要的日子之一
<i>Everyone would agree that one of the most important days of the year</i>

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:07,700

噢 你们不用如此费心的
Oh, you guys didn't have to do this.

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,080
人人都想让妈妈知道自己有多爱她
<i>Everybody wants to show their mama how much they love them.</i>

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,590
就连痞子2Pac都写了首关于他老妈的歌 (歌名monther fuck -_-)
<i>Even 2Pac wrote a song about his mother.</i>

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,750
在母亲节那天 人们都各显神通
<i>On Mother's Day, people pull out all the stops.</i>

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,890

带她去看大片 这样她就可以带顶漂亮的大帽子..
<i>We take her to a great movie so she can wear a great big hat...</i>

15
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,180
为她花光最后1毛钱

噢 真不敢相信你送了这个
Oh, I can't believe you did this.

20
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,230
但如果是父亲节 没人会鸟他
<i>But when it comes to Father's Day, nobody gave a damn.</i>

28
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,510

What the hell is this?

37
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,770

<i>and the only way to do that was to ask him what he wanted.</i>

<font color=#0CE769>人人都恨克里斯 第1季 第22集 "人人都恨父亲节" </font>

60
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,630
等等 你爸爸说他啥也不要?
So, wait, your dad says he doesn't want anything?

61
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,590
也不是 他说他想要一个人待着
Nope. All he said was he wanted to be all alone.

62
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,820
你最好留个心眼儿
You better watch out.

63
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,570
我妈妈曾说过她想独自待一天
My mother said she wanted a day alone.

64
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,080
后来 她就跑路搬到Poughkeepsie去了
The next thing we knew, she left and moved to Poughkeepsie.

65
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,690
嗯 我不管他说了什么 我得为他做点什么
Well, I don't care what he says. I'm gonna get him something.

66
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,150
我爸爸讲了他要什么
<i>My father said what he wanted.</i>

67
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,060
最后他能得到什么我妈妈说了算
<i>My mother said what he was gonna get.</i>

68
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,520
脱离你家庭的一天 这算啥礼物?
What kind of gift is a day off from your family?

69
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,570
就只是一天而已啊
It's just one day.

70
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,820
好吧 那你能想象孩子们是啥感受?
Well, how is that supposed to make the kids feel?

71
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,110
女人总用孩子来折腾男人
<i>Women always used the kids against you.</i>

72
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,420
明明是父亲节 你想要的却是不当父亲
It's Father's Day and you don't want to be a father.

73
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,780
我没那么说啊
I did not say that.

74
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,150
他们想为你庆祝
They're trying to honor you,

75
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,890
你却说 "让我一个人待会"
and all you got to say is, "Leave me the hell alone."

76
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,510
我没说 "让我一个人待会"
I did not say, "Leave me the hell alone."

77
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,830
你说的差不多就是这个意思
You may as well have.

78
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,440
这13年来我都没自己的一天时间
I haven't had a day to myself in 13 years.

79
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,340
如果我不想做爸爸的话.. 我..
If I didn't want to be a father, I...

80
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,480
那表情的意思是 如果你还想做个父亲的话
<i>That look means if you want to keep beg a father</i>

81
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,850
你最好就的赶紧闭嘴
<i>you better keep your mouth shut.</i>

82
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,510
本来那天就该是让我们 为你做点啥特别的
It is supposed to be our day to do something special for you.

83
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,440
我就是这个意思
That's what I'm trying to say.

84
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,940
父亲节啊 我为啥就不能想咋样就咋样呢?
It's Father's Day. Why can't I do what the hell I want to do?

85
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,990
额? 你说啥呢?
Huh? Say what?

86
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,680
额... 你拿了钥匙吗?
Uh... you got the key?

87
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,100
你自己在这待一整天要干啥?
Well, what you gonna do here all day by yourself anyway?

88
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,650
啥也不做
Nothing.

89
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,470
那孩子们至少 可以给你份真正的礼物吧?
Well, can the kids at least get you a real gift?

90
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,750
怎么了?
What?

91
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,160
那是什么?
What's that?

92
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,400
过去4年里我收到的所有 父亲节的贺卡和礼物
Every Father's Day card and present I've gotten for the past four years.

93
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,770
看看这个
Look at this.

94
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,120
一盒直发剂
A box of S-Curl.

95
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,370
我送你的
I got you that.

96
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,920
通心粉做的烟盒
A macaroni cigar box.

97
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,230
- 真可爱 - 还有4条领带..
- That's so cute. - I got four ties--

98
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,700
领带 领结

99
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,260
饰扣式领带...

100
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,410
我送的这个
<i>I got him that.</i>

101
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,380
还有个夹子式领带
...and a clip-on tie.

102
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,530
我都不带领带的
I don't even wear ties.

103
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,720
我又不用出席什么重要场合
I don't go nowhere.

104
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,720
那28.46美圆可以有别的用途
That's $28.46 we could have used on something else.

105
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,870
重要的是我们的心意
Well, it's the thought that counts.

106
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,000
我很感激 真的
I appreciate it, I really do,

107
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,370
但是你买给我礼物
but if you buy me presents,

108
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,580
我就不得不去工作来买单
I'm just gonna have to work to pay it off.

109
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,580
这样的话
At this rate,

110
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,450
我死了也得继续工作
I'll be working when I'm dead.

111
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,060
Julius 你死了 你在这干吗?
Julius, you're dead. What are you doing here?

112
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,640
要付清那些礼物的钱啊
Trying to pay off these presents.

113
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,940
听着 我能在墓地找个活干吗?
Listen, can I work the graveyard shift?

114
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,810
好吧
Fine.

115
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,960
那好吧
Okay, then.

116
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,310
享受你的小破臭假期去吧
Have your little stinky day off.

117
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,730
但是我保证 在你生日那天
But on your birthday I will promise you this.

118
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,610
你会收到个蛋糕 也会喜欢的
You will be getting a cake, and you will like it.

119
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,770
我知道
I know.

120
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,140
你后退 自吻吧
You better jump back and kiss yourself.

121
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,880
还有 在你休息之前
And, uh, put up the groceries.

122
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,180
把这些杂货放好
Before your day off.

123
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,340
他有什么爱好吗?
Does he have any hobbies?

124
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,830
睡懒觉也算吗?
Is taking naps a hobby?

125
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,070
不算
No.

126
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,930
那你在父亲节那天要送什么给你爸爸?
So, what are you getting your dad for Father's Day?

127
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,840
我不知道"送"这个词是否合适
I don't know if "getting" is the right word.

128
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,030
更像是"做"
It's more like "doing."

129
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,380
好吧 那你会为你爸爸做些什么?
Okay, so what are you doing for your dad?

130
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,200
嗯 首先 我会为他做最喜欢的早餐
Well, first, I'm making his favorite breakfast--

131
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,840
谷物早餐跟哈密瓜
Cap'n Crunch and cantaloupe.

132
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,640
我试着想象为我爸做Greg所说的
<i>I tried to imagine doing the things that Greg talked about with my father.</i>

133
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,910
比如给他谷物早餐跟哈密瓜
<i>Like bringing him Cap'n Crunch and cantaloupe.</i>

134
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,920
你傻了吗?
Are you crazy?

135
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,680
儿子 你最好给俺弄点熏肉来
Boy, you better bring me some bacon.

136
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,320
我也想过带我爸爸去动物园看企鹅
<i>I thought about taking my dad to the zoo to see some penguins.</i>

137
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,720
我们花了3.50块就来看 这些不能飞的肥鸟?
We paid $3.50 to see a bird that can't fly?

138
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,680
接下来要我看什么 不吃奶酪的老鼠?
What you gonna show me next, rats that don't eat cheese?

139
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,740
还想了想在家门口放烟花火箭
<i>I even imagined us shooting off bottle rockets in front of the house.</i>

140
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,610
快跑 儿子 快跑!
Run, boy, run!

141
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,220
不知道Greg的爸爸有没中过弹
<i>I wonder if Greg's dad ever got shot at.</i>

142
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,180
你决定要做些什么了吗?
Have you decided what you're gonna do?

143
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,320
你讲的任何一件我都做不了
I can't do any of the stuff that you talked about.

144
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,540
我只有27块
I only have $27.

145
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,890
不错啊
That's not bad.

146
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,980
我要是你 就会搞清他想要啥 然后送给他就成了
If I were you, I'd try and figure out what he needs and just give him that.

147
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,560
要是我一掌扇掉他眉毛 会不会破坏我们的友谊呢
<i>I wonder if it would ruin our friendship if I smacked his eyebrows off?</i>

148
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,290
你找什么呢 Chris?
What you looking for, Chris?

149
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,740
我想找件父亲节礼物送我爸
I'm trying to find my father something for Father's Day.

150
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,860
父亲节
Father's Day.

151
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,460
我爸喜欢枪 酒 还有女人
My daddy liked guns, liquor and women.

152
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,560
我猜他还喜欢蹲牢子
<i>I guess he liked jail, too.</i>

153
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,390
你爸爸喜欢做什么?
What does your daddy like to do?

154
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,970
那可是个难题
That's the tough part.

155
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,050
他除了睡觉就是工作
All he does is sleep and work.

156
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,560
我能想象
I know what that's like.

157
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,100
但是我有样东西很合适
But I got just the thing.

158
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,880
一块瑞士石英表 有液晶屏 带计算跟闹铃功能
A Swiss LCD quartz calculator alarm watch.

159
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,310
嗯 家里他有个闹钟了
Well, he has an alarm clock at home.

160
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,260
他还要块带闹铃的表干吗?
What's he need one in his watch for?

161
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,270
以防万一啊
You never know.

162
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,210
幸好有这块表
Thank goodness for this watch.

163
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,580
我还真没这么想过
I never thought of that.

164
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,250
还带有计算功能
It's got a calculator, too.

165
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,620
他可以算出任何东西的价格
He can figure out how much anything costs.

166
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,330
要是再附上一条熏肉
<i>If it came with a side of bacon,</i>

167
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,040
这将是史上最完美的礼物了
<i>that would have been the best gift in history.</i>

168
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,380
这个多少钱?
How much does it cost?

169
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,750
24.95刀
$24.95.

170
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,050
他胡扯出来的价
He just made that up.

171
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,150
我买了
I'll take it.

172
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:37,870
妈妈 为什么爸爸不想和我们一起过父亲节?
Mama, how come Daddy doesn't want to be with us on Father's Day?

173
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,810
宝贝 不是你爸爸不想和我们一起
Oh, baby, it's not that your daddy doesn't want to be with us,

174
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,150
只是他平日工作太忙了
it's just that he works hard all the time

175
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,030
他只是想有自己的一点点时间
and he just wants to have a little time to be by himself.

176
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
真不错
Man, that's cool.

177
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,790
我都等不急自己当爸爸 这样我自己就可以拥有整个房子
I can't wait until I'm a father so I can have this whole house to myself.

178
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,050
你不会成为这房子里的父亲
You are not gonna be a father in this house,

179
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,460
因为我不可想再照顾任何婴儿
because I ain't taking care of no babies.

180
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,060
神经
Lost your mind.

181
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,980
我们可以送他礼物吗?
Well, can we still get him a present?

182
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,620
当然可以 宝贝 你有打算了?
Sure, baby. What'd you have in mind?

183
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,520
这个
These.

184
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,530
看 我把这些通心粉装饰到爸的旧拖鞋上了
See, I took daddy's old slippers and put macaroni on them.

185
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,370
噢 宝贝 真漂亮
Oh, baby, that's nice.

186
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,630
待会我会帮你包起来
I'm gonna help you wrap them later.

187
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,830
你也能帮我包礼物吗?
Can you help me wrap mine, too?

188
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,240
我在给爸爸做古龙水
I'm making dad cologne.

189
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,480
喔 你从哪里学来的做古龙水?
Oh, where did you learn how to make cologne?

190
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,500
从杂志背面看来的
I saw it in the back of a magazine.

191
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,020
我所需要的就是香油
All I need is oil,

192
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,180
一些香料 还有酒精
something to give it a little smell and, uh, alcohol.

193
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,060
然后放瓶子里闷个一周
Then just leave it in a jar for a week.

194
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,160
妈妈 既然爸爸想一个人过
Mama, since Daddy wants to be by himself,

195
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,360
那我们咋办?
what are we gonna do?

196
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,950
我们会找点乐子的
We are gonna have some fun.

197
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,350
Chris! 吃饭了!
Chris! Time to eat!

198
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,910
嗨 爸爸 那些都是什么东西?
Hey, Dad, what's all that stuff?

199
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,880
我那条线路上的朋友 送我的一包父亲节礼物
It's a bunch of stuff guys on my route got me for Father's Day.

200
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,880
喔 看看这个
Oh, look at this.

201
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,010
一块瑞士石英表 有液晶屏 带计算跟闹铃功能
It's an LCD quartz calculator alarm watch.

202
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,460
这是我得到的最好的礼物
It's the best gift I ever got.

203
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,000
也许我该在他鞋子上粘点通心粉
<i>Maybe I could glue some macaroni to his shoes.</i>

204
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,920
父亲节快乐!
Happy Father's Day!

205
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,860
父亲节快乐 宝贝
Happy Father's Day, baby.

206
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,020
我们爱你
We love you.

207
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,340
我也爱你们
I love y'all, too. Yeah.

208
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,090
你们今天会过的挺愉快 是吧?
Hey, y'all have fun today, okay?

209
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,480
爸爸 你不想先读读贺卡吗?
Daddy, aren't you gonna read your card?

210
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,750
噢 我看看
Ooh, yeah. Let's see here.

211
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,400
"献给世界上最好的老爸"
"To the Best Dad in the Whole World."

212
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,420
真体贴啊
That's so sweet.

213
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,830
噢 谢谢
Oh, thank you.

214
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,990
嘿 你们今天自己玩的开心点哈 拜拜
Hey, y'all enjoy y'all selves today, all right? Okay, bye-bye.

215
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,330
爸爸 我们早饭做了你最喜欢吃的东西
Dad, we made your favorite thing for breakfast.

216
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,570
还给你带了你的痛风药
And I brought your gout pills,

217
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,740
所以你现在吃啥都不用担心了
so now you can eat all you want without worrying.

218
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,670
熏肉 芝士蛋
Man, bacon, eggs with cheese,

219
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,910
饼干和黄油
biscuits and butter.

220
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,030
感觉像上了天堂一样
I feel like I died and went to heaven.

221
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,960
- 谢谢 宝贝 - 没什么 宝贝
- Thank you, baby. - Oh, ain't nothing, baby.

222
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,260
- 这都是孩子们做的 - 你们啥时候走 嗯?
- They did it all. - When y'all leaving, huh?

223
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,440
好吧 马上走
All right, in a minute.

224
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,980
不客气
And you're welcome.

225
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,130
还有宝贝 记得要吃这些药 好吗?
And baby, make sure you take those pills, okay?

226
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,260
好的
All right.

227
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,360
你们几个准备好 我们得走了
You guys go get ready so we can go.

228
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,200
快点 迅速点

229
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,710
- 他们是不是很体贴? - 走吧
- Isn't that sweet? - There you go.

230
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,380
我们有世上最好的孩子
We have the best kids in the world.

231
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,730
- 是啊 - 他们体贴
- Oh, yeah. - They're so sweet.

232
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,840
是的
They are.

233
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,890
那表情是 "你怎么还赖着不走?"
That look means, "Ain't you supposed to be leaving?"

234
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,660
你也得快点 我的意思是...
You better hurry up. I mean...

235
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,690

额 你们要去干吗?
Uh, what y'all doing?

238
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,240
先去趟博物馆
We're going to the museum.

239
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,780
然后去看电影<颠倒乾坤>
And to see the movie Trading Places.

240
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,710
- 噢 那一定非常有趣 - 是的 是的
- Oh, that should be funny. - Right. Right.

241

那你最好快点啦
So, you better hurry up, all right?

242
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,300
好了 Julius 我们走了
Okay, Julius, we're leaving.

243
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,080
晚饭时我会回来的 好吧?
All right, well, I'll be home in time for dinner, okay?

244
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,380
谢谢 我爱你
Thank you. I love you.

245
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,200
我也爱你 宝贝
I love you, too, baby.

246
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,200
祝你过的愉快
You have a good day.

247
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,490
嗯 我会的
All right. Oh, I will.

248
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,170
赶快出去吧
Get on out of here.

249
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,370
父亲节快乐!
Happy Father's Day!

250
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,790
- 你玩得开心点 - 我会的
- Hey, enjoy yourself. - I will.

251
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,990
对我爸来说 可以过上随心所欲的一天
<i>For my father to have one day where he could do</i>

252
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,470
就像找到百万美元似的
<i>whatever he felt like doing was like finding a million dollars.</i>

253
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,530
他在沙发上睡觉
<i>He slept on the couch.</i>

254
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,040
他在床上睡
<i>He slept in the bed.</i>

255
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,770
他在饭桌睡 做他的白日大美梦
<i>He slept on the dining room table and dreamt his favorite dreams.</i>

256
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,790
17分钱的黄油
17 cent worth of butter.

257
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,540
他看保龄球
<i>He watched bowling.</i>

258
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,380
耶!
Yeah!

259
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,170
棒!
Yes!

260
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,520
他看棒球
<i>He watched baseball.</i>

261
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,540
- 投球 接着... - 耶!
- Here's the pitch. And... - Yeah!

262
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,510
他看高尔夫
<i>He watched golf.</i>

263
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,610
球在路上 进了
It's on it way, and it's in.

264
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:37,500
甚至做了我们都不知道他会的事 比如画画
<i>He even did stuff we didn't know he did, like painting.</i>

265
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,270
还有唱他最爱的歌曲
<i>And singing his favorite songs.</i>

266
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:45,710
一开始我很担心 不知所措

267
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:49,870
一直在想 ]有你在身边 我一定活不下去

268
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,940
但是后来 我花了很多个夜晚

269
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,040
思考你是如何错待我

270
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:58,130
我开始变的坚强 学会了独立

271
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,160
你从火星

272
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,510
回到地球
<i>I didn't say he knew all the words.</i>

273
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,700
我可没说他记得住词

274
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:06,380
我走进屋 看见你满脸凄楚

275
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,400
我早该换个门锁

276
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,570
我早该叫你把钥匙留下

277
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,170
如果我知道

278
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,930
你会回来骚扰我的话

279
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,340
噢 走吧!

280
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,490
滚回火星吧

281
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,420
转身滚蛋吧

282
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,180
你一点也不受欢迎

283
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,010
你不正是那个抛弃我的负心汉

284
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,820
你觉得我会崩溃?

285
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,180
就这样郁郁而终?

286
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,840
我不是这种人!

287
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,950
我会活下去~

288
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,780
当我爸爸在做平时我们在的时候 他不会做的事
<i>While my father was doing things he wouldn't do while we were around,</i>

289
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:42,130
我们也在做平时他在的时候 我们不会做的事
<i>we were doing things we wouldn't do while he was around.</i>

290
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,400
你们都要待在我视线范围内
Okay, y'all stay where I can see you.

291
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,750
好吧 Chris 你确定吗?
All right, now, Chris, you sure about this?

292
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,030
Harris先生把表钱退给我了
Mr. Harris gave me my money back on the watch,

293
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,300
所以我想去买东西
so I wanted to go shopping

294
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,580
看看能不能找到爸爸喜欢的东西
and see if I can find Dad something that he'll like.

295
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,390
行 不过不管有没买到礼物
Okay. But gift or no gift,

296
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,990
你要是6点半不回家 我就叫警察
if you're not home by 6:30, I'm calling the police.

297
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,690
我妈妈经常告诫我们 要是不按时回家
<i>My mother always told us if we weren't home on time,</i>

298
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,280
她就会叫警察
<i>she was calling the police.</i>

299
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,480
给你
Here.

300
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:04,550
这是什么?
What's this?

301
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,100
这钱本来用来给你爸爸买礼物的
Oh, it's just money I was gonna use to buy a gift for your dad.

302
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,970
谢谢
Thanks.

303
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,820
别客气 宝贝 小心点
You're welcome, baby. Be careful.

304
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,620
唯一比给拥有一切的人
<i>The only thing tougher than finding a gift</i>

305
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,330
买个礼物还难的事
<i>for the man that has everything</i>

306
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,210
就是给个啥也不要的人买礼物
<i>is finding one for the man that wants nothing.</i>

307
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,180
我爸穿西装 只会是在葬礼 毕业典礼上
<i>The only time my father wore a suit was at funerals, graduations,</i>

308
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,300
以及洗衣日那天
<i>and on laundry day.</i>

309
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,240
我爸爸最近的一次接近珠宝
<i>The closest my father got to jewelry</i>

310
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,010
是听Neil Diamond(钻石)的歌
<i>was listening to Neil Diamond.</i>

311
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,210
希望钻石能跟分期一样恒久远
<i>I hope it lasts as long as the payments.</i>

312
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:37,210
我不确定他会去喂兔子 还是用兔子来喂我们
<i>I wasn't sure if he would feed the rabbit, or use the rabbit to feed us.</i>

313
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,830
很明显他也不是穿腿套的料
<i>And let's just say he wasn't the leg warmer type.</i>

314
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,270
当我试着想出该给父亲买点啥的时候
<i>While I was trying to figure out what to get my father,</i>

315
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:49,270
我妈妈在想她给自己揽了什么蠢差事
<i>my mother was trying to figure out what she had gotten herself into.</i>

316
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,390
那是什么?
What is that?

317
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,340
呃宝贝
Well, honey,

318
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,940
那是艺术
that's art.

319
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,450
你确定?
You sure?

320
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,310
看起来像是有人中枪后掉进芥末桶里去了
Looks like somebody got shot and fell in a bucket of mustard.

321
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,320
安静 儿子
Be quiet, boy.

322
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,510
这是文化
This is culture.

323
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,470
那我们还要吸收多少文化?
How much more culture do we have to get?

324
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,300
女儿 就盯着这画看
Girl, just look at the picture.

325
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,200
我希望爸爸在这里
I wish Dad was here.

326
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,290
也许他能解释这个
Maybe he could explain this.

327
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,710
- 嘿 Risky? - 等等 小子
- Hey, Risky? - Hold up, little man.

328
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:28,110
我把想得到的地方都找了个遍
<i>I had looked for a gift everywhere I could,</i>

329
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,940
最后决定来不该来的地方找找
<i>so I decided to look somewhere I shouldn't look.</i>

330
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,130
你有什么样的父亲节礼物?
So, what kind of stuff do you have for Father's Day?

331
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,130
父亲节?
Father's Day?

332
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,690
这对我来说不是啥大事
That ain't a big one for me.

333
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,290
你知道这附近就只有4个爸爸
You know there ain't none but four fathers in the neighborhood.

334
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:41,180
要是母亲节 我可有一大箩筐东东
Now, Mother's Day-- I had a whole bunch of stuff.

335
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,240
小子 你有多少钱可花?
Man, how much you got to spend?

336
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,190
37块
$37.

337
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,780
37块? 你干啥了 劫了家酒店??
$37? What you do, knock over a liquor store?

338
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,800
我存下来的
I saved up.

339
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
继续这么存
Man, you keep saving up like that,

340
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,310
你很快就是个富翁了
you'll be rich in a minute.

341
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,970
也许那时我会买件 他穿的这种粉色毛衣
<i>Maybe then I can buy one of those pink sweaters, like him.</i>

342
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,380
你爸爸听音乐吗?
Your old man like music?

343
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,470
有谁的?
Who's that?

344
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,110
我们有约翰・特拉沃塔
We got John Travolta,

345
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,180
威廉・夏特纳

346
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,320
李柏瑞斯
Liberace.

347
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,380
这是给听不了 艾尔顿・约翰的年长父亲们的
<i>That's for fathers that were too old for Elton John.</i>

348
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,380
不 谢谢了
No, thanks.

349
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,640
你还有些别的吗?
What else you got?

350
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,070
这些怎样... 送你老妈?
How about these... for your mom?

351
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,430
- 以父亲节的名义? - 嗯 给你爸送给你妈
- For Father's Day? - Yeah. For him to give to her.

352
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,210
不
No.

353
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,960
抱歉我不能帮你了 小屁孩
I'm sorry I can't help you out, young blood,

354
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,590
但是母亲节那天来找我 保证让你满意
but, hey, you come back Mother's Day-- I'll hook you up.

355
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,680
听着 帮我看着这里几分钟好吗?
Listen, why don't you watch this for a few minutes?

356
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,600
我要过街付电费
I'm gonna run across the street, pay my light bill.

357
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,140
- 好吗? - 好的
- All right? - Sure.

358
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,700
告诉你爸爸打电话给我 顺便祝他父亲节快乐
Tell your daddy to call me and happy Father's Day.

359
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,240
回到家 我爸爸仍然独自一人霸着大屋
<i>Back at home, my father still had the house to himself...</i>

360
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,460
Rochelle?
Rochelle?

361
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,160
Chris?
Chris?

362
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,130
不管他喜欢与否
<i>...whether he liked it or not.</i>

363
00:15:44,073 --> 00:15:47,402
<i>And if you order now, you'll get a set of microwavable...</i>

364
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:49,564
<i>In the city that never sleeps.</i>

365
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:52,286
<i>Psychic Station TV Network...</i>

366
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,590
这个骄傲的公鹅也不例外
<i>This proud father goose is no exception.</i>

367
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:58,850
他和蔼的关注着 保护着他的小孩
<i>He graciously watches over and protects his chicks,</i>

368
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,760
在它们能自己独立自保之前 保护着他们的安全
<i>assuring their safety until they are old enough to fend for themselves.</i>

369
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:05,720
在野外 小动物不会被父母抛弃
<i>In the wild, babies are almost never abandoned,</i>

370
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,630
父母也不会长时间留他们独处
<i>and rarely left alone for any extended period of time.</i>

371
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,010
一代伟人曾说过
<i>A great man once said,</i>

372
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,690
"大爱无言 大言无声"
<i>"Nothing screams louder than the sound of silence."</i>

373
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,480
我想这是绿野仙踪里的铁皮人说的
<i>I think it was Nipsy Russell.</i>

374
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,910
谢谢 祝你看得开心
Thank you. Enjoy your show.

375
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,860
嗨  我要一张成人票
Hi. Um, can I have one adult,

376
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:24,220
二张儿童票 看<颠倒乾坤>
two children for Trading Places, please?

377
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,590
你一定当我傻呢
You must think I'm a fool.

378
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,540
你想要我相信他不到12岁?
You want me to believe he's under 12?

379
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,570
他就是不到啊
Yeah, she does.

380

- 嗨! - 爸爸!
- Hey! - Dad!

What are you doing here, baby?

382
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,350
我想你们啊
I missed you guys.

383
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,900
没有家人陪伴的父亲节
Father's Day without your family--

384
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,450
感觉像我不是个父亲似的
it's like not being a father.

385
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,550
那表情是说
<i>That look means,</i>

386
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,500
"我一直跟你这么说啊 笨蛋!"
<i>"That's what I was trying to tell yo' stupid ass!"</i>

387
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,620
来吧
Come here.

- Where's Chris? - Oh, he went to buy you a gift.

389
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,770
- 但是我都说了... - Julius 拜托
- But I told... - Julius, please,

390
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:59,360
答应我 你就表现的像是你从没收到过 这么好的礼物似的 好吗?
just promise me you will act like it's the best gift you've ever gotten, okay?

391
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,720
我答应
I promise.

392
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,780
好吧 好吧
All right. All right.

393
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:07,150
2个孩子 2个大人 看<颠倒乾坤>
That'll be two kids, two adults for, uh, Trading Places.

394
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:12,830

- What's this? - Father's Day special-- two for one.

395
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,160
父亲节快乐 爸爸
Happy Father's Day, Daddy.

396
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,470
我做了这个送你
I made these for you.

397
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,190
我知道你说不要送礼物的
I know you said, don't get you a gift,

398
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:27,190
但是我还是想送你点什么 怕你又改变主意啥的
but I wanted to give you something just in case you changed your mind.

399
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,760
噢! 通心粉装饰的拖鞋!
Oh! Macaroni-covered slippers!

400
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:34,400
和去年送的通心粉烟盒正好凑一对
It goes with the macaroni-covered cigar box I got last year.

401
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,400
我知道
I know.

402
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,900
嗨 爸爸 我也有东西送你
Hey, Dad, I got something for you, too.

403
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,900
哦 这是什么?
Oh, what's this?

404
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,200
一瓶碘酒?
A bottle of iodine?

405
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,910
不不 这是古龙水 我亲手做的
No, no, no, it's cologne. I made it myself.

406
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,880
只是一时找不到瓶子装
I just couldn't find a bottle to put it in,

407
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,380
就把碘酒给倒了 然后装了这瓶子里
so I poured the iodine out and put it in there.

408
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,740
儿子 那碘酒值99...
Boy, that iodine cost 99...

409
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,940
闻起来不错
That smells good.

410
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,950
谢谢你 Drew
Thank you, Drew.

411
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,900
非常感谢你
Oh, man, thank you so much.

412
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,200
你知道我正要去报警吗?
You know I was about to call the police, right?

413
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,550
嘿 Chris你去哪里了?
Hey, Chris, where you been?

414
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,440
我试着给你找份父亲节礼物
I was trying to find you a gift for Father's Day.

415
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,430
嗯 无论你带来了什么 都不错
Well, I'm sure whatever you got, it's-it's fine.

416
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,970
事实上 我寻遍了各处
That's the thing-- I looked all over,

417
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,620
都没找到我觉得你会喜欢的东西
but I couldn't find you anything that I thought you would like.

418
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,480
没关系 Chris 重要的是你的心意
Doesn't matter, Chris. I mean, it's the thought that counts.

419
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,070
那你找到了吗?
So, did you find something?

420
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,580
没有
Not really.

421
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,620
但我为你做了点东西
It's more of, I did something for you.

422
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
什么?
What?

423
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,400
这是什么?
What is it?

424
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,900
一个收据
It's a receipt.

425
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,080
他交了电费
He paid the electric bill.

426
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,090
噢 宝贝 这真是..
Oh, baby, that is so...

427
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,260
当我问你 送什么父亲节礼物的时候
When I asked you if I could get you anything

428
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,720
你说我可以帮你清张帐单
for Father's Day, you said I could help you knock out a bill.

429
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,110
电费是我唯一可以付得起的
That was the only one I could afford.

430
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,500
谢谢 儿子
Thanks, son.

431
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,230
我爸爸从不真的在乎啥礼物
<i>My father never really cared much about presents,</i>

432
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:05,780
但是给他个微笑的理由 是我为他做的最好的事
<i>but giving him a reason to smile was the best thing I could ever do for him.</i>

433
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,870
这是我收到的最棒的礼物
This is the best gift I ever got.

434
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,430
我会永远记住这个的
I'll remember this forever.

435
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,550
父亲节快乐
Happy Father's Day.

436
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,410
我以你为荣 Chris
I'm proud of you, Chris.

437
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,500
每天越来越像个大人了
Becoming more of a man every day.

438
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,500
谢谢 爸爸
Thanks, Dad.

439
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,170
你知道吗 我在想
You know, I was thinking,

440
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:23,740
你找份工作 然后每个月都付点帐单 会是个不错的主意
it might be a good idea if you get a job and start paying a bill every month.
