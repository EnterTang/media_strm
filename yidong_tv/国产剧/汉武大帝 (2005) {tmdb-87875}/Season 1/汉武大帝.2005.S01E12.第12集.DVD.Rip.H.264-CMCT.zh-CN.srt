1
00:21:30,308 --> 00:21:31,423
-是  -好的
- Yep. - OK.

2
00:21:35,091 --> 00:21:36,641
你曾告诉我杀人
You told me that killing someone 

3
00:21:36,642 --> 00:21:38,637
是这世界上最丑恶的事
was the ugliest thing in the world.

4
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,008
最丑恶的事之一
One of them.

5
00:21:45,502 --> 00:21:47,010
我终于明白了
I finally get it.

6
00:21:50,107 --> 00:21:51,946
我觉得我有问题
I thought there was something wrong with me

7
00:21:51,947 --> 00:21:55,353
我杀尼克・博伊尔时一点也没有厌恶感
because I didn't feel ugly when I killed Nick Boyle.

8
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,405
我感觉很好
I felt good.

9
00:22:00,271 --> 00:22:02,307
所以撒起谎来也容易
That's why it was so easy to lie about it.

10
00:22:04,415 --> 00:22:06,300
感觉像你没做错任何事
Like you didn't do anything wrong.

11
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,040
你杀我爸爸的时候感觉自己做错了吗
Feel like you'd done something wrong when you killed my dad?

12
00:22:12,695 --> 00:22:14,250
我吓坏了
I felt terrified.

13
00:22:16,331 --> 00:22:17,488
然后
And then...

14
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,610
我感到充满力量
I felt powerful.

15
00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:24,846
当你终于结束它
It felt good...

16
00:22:26,234 --> 00:22:29,427
终结这一切  那种感觉很好
to get to end it, to stop it all.

17
00:22:31,004 --> 00:22:33,387
我以为我已经摆脱他了
I thought I got away from him. 

18
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:36,705
我想我们俩都未曾摆脱你父亲
I don't think either of us have gotten away from your father.

19
00:22:38,994 --> 00:22:40,425
我好希望我杀了他
I wish I'd killed him.

20
00:22:42,474 --> 00:22:43,831
为我妈妈的死
For killing my mom,

21
00:22:45,055 --> 00:22:47,399
为那些女孩的死  为他把我...
for killing all those girls, for making me...

22
00:22:49,043 --> 00:22:50,175
把你怎么了  阿比盖尔
Making you what, Abigail?

23
00:22:50,176 --> 00:22:51,266
把我卷入其中
Part of it.

24
00:22:52,884 --> 00:22:54,803
卷入这所有的事
Part of any of it.

25
00:22:56,527 --> 00:22:58,941
我的生活不该变成这样
This wasn't supposed to be my life.

26
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,602
感觉就像我爸爸还在这里
It feels like my dad's still out there.

27
00:23:06,813 --> 00:23:08,149
从某种意义上说  他的确还在
In a way, he is.

28
00:23:10,777 --> 00:23:12,285
你是说那个模仿犯
You mean the copycat.

29
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:16,789
我觉得我能抓到他
I think I can catch him.

30
00:23:25,552 --> 00:23:27,174
但我需要你的帮助
But I'm gonna need your help.

31
00:23:43,972 --> 00:23:46,626
一位FBI探员来找过我
An agent from the FBI came to see me.

32
00:23:48,622 --> 00:23:52,968
他向我了解你和威尔・格雷厄姆的关系
He asked me questions about your relationship with Will Graham.

33
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:55,546
杰克・克劳福德来过了
Jack Crawford was here?

34
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:01,031
对于你告诉他的
He had enough doubt

35
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,947
关于你的病人的事  他有许多疑虑
in whatever it is you told him about your patient

36
00:24:04,227 --> 00:24:06,362
需要得到证实
to feel the need to verify.

37
00:24:07,274 --> 00:24:10,219
他认为阿比盖尔・霍布斯是她父亲的帮凶
He believes Abigail Hobbs was involved in her father's crimes,

38
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,472
并怀疑威尔在保护她
and he suspects Will is protecting her.

39
00:24:12,989 --> 00:24:16,154
很显然他还怀疑你在保护威尔
And evidently he suspects you are protecting Will.

40
00:24:18,219 --> 00:24:19,241
你是吗
Are you?

41
00:24:20,494 --> 00:24:22,584
你是作为我的心理医生问我吗
Are you asking as my psychiatrist?

42
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,970
走出作为你心理医生的身份
I'm stepping out of my role as your psychiatrist

43
00:24:27,971 --> 00:24:31,483
现在我作为同事与你交谈
and I'm speaking to you now as your colleague.

44
00:24:32,895 --> 00:24:35,172
不管你在对威尔・格雷厄姆做什么
Whatever you're doing with Will Graham,

45
00:24:35,784 --> 00:24:36,981
停下
stop.

46
00:24:38,629 --> 00:24:39,971
威尔需要我的帮助
Will needs my help.

47
00:24:41,214 --> 00:24:43,373
你已经越界了
You've crossed professional lines.

48
00:24:44,295 --> 00:24:45,699
交个朋友就是越界吗
By making a friend?

49
00:24:47,161 --> 00:24:49,680
【求校对】你不能代表对方来与自己建立友谊
You cannot function as an agent of friendship

50
00:24:49,681 --> 00:24:52,734
【求校对】尤其是他对你的行为毫不知情
for a man who is disconnected from the concept

51
00:24:53,084 --> 00:24:56,293
【求校对】你这样做是假装自己不知情
as a man who is disconnected from the concept.

52
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:58,488
我在保护威尔免受影响
I'm protecting Will from influence.

53
00:24:59,755 --> 00:25:01,722
对于他为何成为这样这个问题
He has flaws in his intuitive beliefs about

54
00:25:01,723 --> 00:25:03,370
他的直觉有误
what makes him who he is.

55
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,166
我在试图让他理解
I'm trying to help him understand.

56
00:25:05,723 --> 00:25:07,478
也许你做不到
You may not be able to.

57
00:25:09,578 --> 00:25:10,892
【求校对】我不愿告诉威尔我对他的极力帮助
I'm not comfortable telling Will

58
00:25:10,893 --> 00:25:13,100
【求校对】可能是无效的  也不愿告诉他
that my very best attempts to help him may fail

59
00:25:13,101 --> 00:25:14,505
【求校对】我对他的忠实和治疗
and that my loyalty to him

60
00:25:14,506 --> 00:25:16,501
【求校对】会受到威胁
and his treatment could be compromised.

61
00:25:16,502 --> 00:25:18,290
那就告诉他别的
Then tell him something else.

62
00:25:20,682 --> 00:25:24,267
克劳福德探员还问了我我遇袭的事
Agent Crawford also asked me about my attack.

63
00:25:28,622 --> 00:25:29,544
了然
I see.

64
00:25:32,074 --> 00:25:33,386
你怎么说的
What did you tell him?

65
00:25:36,507 --> 00:25:37,968
真假参半
Half-truths.

66
00:25:40,328 --> 00:25:42,880
我告诉他一个暴力的病人
That a violent patient

67
00:25:42,881 --> 00:25:45,469
在袭击我的时候  又改变主意了
swallowed his tongue while he was attacking me.

68
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,065
我没说过程和原因
I didn't tell him how or why

69
00:25:51,066 --> 00:25:53,192
没说是谁
or who was responsible.

70
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,396
你在杰克・克劳福德面前保护自己的病人
You protect your patient from Jack Crawford,

71
00:25:59,527 --> 00:26:01,127
而我就不能
but I can't protect mine.

72
00:26:01,198 --> 00:26:02,439
【求校对】是不能继续
Not anymore.

73
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,624
即使是最顶尖的心理医生
Even the very best psychiatrists

74
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:09,187
在专业能力上也有其无力之处
have an inherent limitation to their professional abilities.

75
00:26:09,718 --> 00:26:13,152
或许这对你很难接受
You may find that difficult to accept.

76
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,745
对  的确很难接受
You're right. It is.

77
00:26:16,267 --> 00:26:19,221
你必须保持距离  汉尼拔
You have to maintain boundaries, Hannibal.

78
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:24,622
当我和威尔的私人和医患关系
When the pressures of my personal and professional relationships

79
00:26:24,623 --> 00:26:26,664
造成的压力变得不可承受时
with Will grow too great,

80
00:26:27,057 --> 00:26:28,230
我向你保证...
I assure you...

81
00:26:29,687 --> 00:26:31,363
那时我想办法释放压力的
I'll find a way to relieve them.
