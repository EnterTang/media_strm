艾米莉不是你的挚友  阿曼达

11
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,880
需要更多的证明吗
You need more proof?

12
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,960
我打给你律师了  
I called your lawyer

13
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,320
我让她送来了离婚文书
I had her send over a messenger with the divorce papers.

14
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,510
是时候了结这一切了
It's time to end this.

15
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,190
你家人一刻不停地来电话
Your family has been calling nonstop.

16
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,880
你最终还是得面对他们的
You gotta face 'em eventually.

17
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,880
杰克・波特

拿好箱子

00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,610
将你父亲的秘密带离此处  掩埋起来

20
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:20,840
和我去巴黎吧
Come to Paris with me.

21
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,110
我做不到
I can't.

22
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,590
你好啊  丹尼
Hello, Danny.

23
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,490
不  不要  不要  阿曼达
No! No, no, no! Amanda!

24
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,120
-我的天  -我没有
- My god.  - I-I didn't.

25
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,170
快走  我的卡车就停在路边 
Go. My truck's up the road.

26
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,610
钥匙在里面
The keys are inside.

27
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,110
喂
Hey!

28
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,320
妈妈
Mom!

29
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,500
是泰勒
It's tyler.

30
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,760
妈妈
Mom?

31
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,830
我
I...

32
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,700
什么也别说
Don't say a word.

33
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,340
我父亲的含冤入狱教会我
My father's false imprisonment taught me that

34
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,660
危机时如何迅速辨别谁是真朋友
in a crisis you quickly find out who your real friends are.

35
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,270
身处悲剧与丑闻漩涡时  似乎
Tragedy and scandal, it seems,

36
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,300
我们才能搞清何为心中至重
have a unique way of clarifying people's priorities.

37
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,460
我们听到海岸沙丘那边
We heard a cell phone ring

38
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,040
有一阵手机铃声
up by the sand dune.

39
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,350
我看到一个穿深色帽衫的人
I saw someone in a dark hoodie

40
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,900
藏在锯齿草丛后
hiding behind the saw grass.

41
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,470
我不知道  可能穿了件帽衫
I don't know. It could've been a hoodie.

42
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,750
也可能是别的  比如是派对的嘉宾
It could've been anything, like a guest from the party.

43
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,540
真说不好
It's hard to say.

44
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,230
泰勒不是个坏人  他病了
Tyler wasn't a bad person. He--he was sick.

45
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,090
那家伙让我手臂开了花
The guy went all benihana on my arm

46
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,660
还把我绑在椅子上
and tied me to a chair.

47
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,560
那家伙是个讨厌鬼
That boy was a menace.

48
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,330
你们这些人要是再尽职点
If you people had been doing your jobs,

49
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,930
就该在这个疯子拿着枪把我当人质之后
you'd have made sure the little psychopath

50
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,380
把他严密看押起来
stayed locked up after holding us all hostage at gunpoint.

51
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,650
我回家去拿丹尼尔的衣服的时候
When I went home to get Daniel clothes,

52
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,690
我发现我的枪不见了
I saw that my gun was missing.

53
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,310
我忘了关窗  泰勒肯定是
I'd left a window open. Tyler must have...

54
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,620
趁我们都在派对时  偷偷潜入偷了枪
Broken in and stolen it while we were at the party.

55
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,340
你和巴罗先生当时为什么打架
So what were you and Mr. Barrol fighting about?

56
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,710
我不记得我们打过架
I don't remember a fight.

57
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,520
你头上缝了15针
You have 15 stitches in your head.

58
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,160
这你怎么解释
How do you explain that?

59
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,480
泰勒有暴力史
Tyler had a history of violence,

60
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,640
他在你生日派对上 威胁过你们全家
he threatened your whole family at your birthday party.

61
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,270
瞧  我理解
Look, I can understand

62
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,030
你觉得当时命悬一线
if you felt like your life was in danger...

63
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:13,020
所以你射杀了他  是不是
You shot him, didn't you?

64
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,290
什么也别说
Don't say a word.

65
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,220
我不记得了
I don't remember.

66
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,210
格雷森先生  夫人
Mr. and Mrs. Grayson,

67
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,700
你们在汉普顿这几个月可真多彩啊
you've had a very busy few months here in the Hamptons.

68
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,910
你会对他提起诉讼吗
Are you charging him?

69
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,250
目前不会
Not yet,

70
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,600
如果你们想趁着劳动节的返城流
but if you're planning on joining

71
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,970
逃入城里的话
the Labor Day exodus to the city,

72
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:45,810
趁早打消此念
don't.

73
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,590
我们现在带他回家
Well, then we're going to be taking him home.

74
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,970
你们可能忘了  他头部受到重创
In case it's lost upon you, he has severe head injury.

75
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,320
他同样浑身浴血  很可能是受害者的血
He's also covered in blood, presumably the victim's,

76
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,680
而受害者明显是被从他未婚妻手枪中
who was apparently killed by bullets

77
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,910
射出的子弹所杀
fired from his fiancee's gun.

78
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,490
不  我们仍有许多问题要问
No, we still have a lot of questions.

79
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,110
在他的律师到来前  不会回答你的问题
Yeah, which won't be answered until his lawyer is present.

80
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,280
或者你希望我现在叫律师来
Or do you want me to call him right now

81
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,020
告诉他我儿子的权利正在受到侵害吗
and just let him know that my son's rights are being violated?

82
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,020
格雷森先生  跟我走
Mr. Grayson, come with me.

83
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,580
来吧  咱们回家
Come on. Let's go home.

84
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,990
外面有车等着
We have a car waiting for you.

85
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,460
我和艾米莉走
I'm gonna go with Emily,

86
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,460
但我得先和我妈谈谈
but I need to speak to my mother first...

87
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,120
单独谈谈
Alone.

88
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,480
听你的
Whatever you need.

89
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,750
干得好  跑回家制造证据
Smart move, running back to the house to create a cover

90
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,370
解释为何泰勒拿着你的枪
for how Tyler got your gun.

91
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,260
这说不定无关紧要
It might not even matter.

92
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,230
泰勒说不定已将真相告诉丹尼尔了
Tyler could've told Daniel everything.

93
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,530
泰勒的话不可靠
Tyler's not exactly a reliable source,

94
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,390
而且  丹尼尔爱你
and... Daniel loves you.

95
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,340
除非这种爱意已变
Unless that's changed.

96
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,000
在派对上我们吵了一架
We had an argument at the party.

97
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,250
我也不知道我们身处何处
I'm not sure where we stand.

98
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,300
你现在身处警局
Well, you're standing in a police station,

99
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,870
而且我认为更重要的是
and I would say the more pressing issue

100
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,580
你父亲的无尽之盒的下落
is the whereabouts of your father's infinity box.

101
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,180
绝对安全
It's safe and sound.

102
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,550
准备走了吗
You ready to go?

103
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,210
是的
Yeah.

104
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,000
你还好吗
Are you okay?

105
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,680
你刚才和你妈妈说了什么
What were you talking to your mother about?

106
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,820
我们在派对上有过争执
We had words at the party.

107
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,970
我只想
I just...

108
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,850
我只想消除一下误解
I just wanted to clear the air.

109
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,290
这很好啊  你现在需要
That's good. You're gonna need...

110
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,500
能找到的所有支持
As much support as you can get right now.

111
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,400
丹尼尔  你和泰勒在海滩上到底发生了什么
Daniel, what happened on the beach with you and Tyler?

112
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,860
汤姆・金斯莱
米歇尔・班克斯
弗兰克・史蒂芬
梅森・特德韦尔

113
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:55,860
这什么啊
What's this?

114
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,090
不如我们打给你未婚妻  问问她
Why don't we call your fiancee and ask her?

115
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,950
不管怎么说
I did, after all,

116
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,640
这是我在她客厅的地板里找到的
find it underneath her living room floorboards.

117
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,290
我不记得了
I don't remember.

118
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,770
我让厨师准备了早饭
I had the cook set up some breakfast

119
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:14,960
以防你们饿了
in case you're hungry.

120
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,210
我也一直在网上跟踪媒体
I've also been tracking the media coverage

121
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:17,930
对丹尼尔的相关报道
of Daniel online.

122
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,740
等等  等一下  怎么
Wait a second. Wait. How, uh...

123
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,260
谁通知的媒体
Who alerted the media?

124
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,660
网上有一张丹尼尔穿着
Well, there's a picture online of Daniel

125
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,590
染血燕尾服的照片
in his bloody tux.

126
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,160
肯定是派对上的某人偷拍的
Someone from the party must have snapped it.

127
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,880
他们可真懂得礼貌啊
Oh, well, so much for decorum.

128
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,790
她说的没错  网上已经传遍了
She's right. It's everywhere.

129
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,640
百万富豪海滩血战
"Bloody billionaire beach battle"?

130
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,140
警方真以为是丹尼尔杀的泰勒吗
Do the police really think Daniel killed Tyler?

131
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,550
当然不是
Of course not.

132
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,540
我父亲已经乘直升飞机飞回城里
Well, dad took the helicopter into the city.

133
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,830
飞机回来时  我保证载回来
When it returns, I've made sure

134
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,470
曼哈顿最好的
the best defense attorney in Manhattan

135
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,700
辩护律师
is gonna be on board.

136
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,440
阿什莉  你能帮我拿片阿司匹林吗
Ashley, could you please get me an aspirin?

137
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,130
当然可以
Of course.

138
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,220
我认为她的精力更应该
I think her time would be better

139
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,380
集中于如何把那张照片撤下来
spent trying to get that photograph taken down.

140
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,560
好的  我会打给诺兰・罗斯
Okay, I'll call Nolan Ross

141
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,820
问问我们能否借用他的技术团队
and see if we can have access to his tech team.

142
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,880
至于这位小姐  你得睡觉去了
And you should get to bed, young lady.

143
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,570
好好休息
Get some rest.

144
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,520
接下来的几天肯定风起云涌  极富挑战
The next few days are gonna be challenging.

145
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,370
我只是来拿换洗衣物的
I'm only here to pick up clothes.

146
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,080
我要回德克兰那里
I'm going back to Declan's.

147
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,440
亲爱的  我们需要你留在这里
Sweetheart, we need you to stay here.

148
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,530
你哥哥有大麻烦了
Your brother's in real trouble,

149
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,610
我们作为家人得团结起来
and we need to stay together as a family.

150
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:07,130
你妈妈说得对
Your mother's right.

151
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,640
我们得统一战线
We need to present a united front.

152
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,840
好吧
Fine.

153
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,900
你一旦搬回来了  我就马上回来
I'll move back in when you do.

154
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,770
看吧
That's what I thought.

155
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,180
你一定累坏了
You must be exhausted.

156
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,410
山姆
Hey, Sammy.

157
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,010
你该带它去遛一圈
You should take him for a walk.

158
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,330
我会的
I will.

159
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,080
先换件衣服
Just gonna change first.

160
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,010
你去哪了
Where you been?

161
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,140
天呐  德克
Oh, jeez. Dec.

162
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,240
你吓死我了
You scared the hell outta me.

163
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,840
你在这里干什么
What are you doing in here?

164
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,610
我在想你发生什么事了
I've been wondering what happened to you.

165
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,270
我以为你起航去海地了
I thought you sailed off to Haiti.

166
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,090
我的引擎坏了
My engine crapped out.

167
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,690
一小时前我看到阿曼达号还在泊位时
I figured that when I saw the "Amanda" in her slip

168
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,500
就猜到了
an hour ago.

169
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,330
那你这段时间都上哪去了
So where you been all this time?

170
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,790
凌晨五点了  伙计
It's 5:00 in the morning, man.

171
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,520
你怎么还不睡
Why aren't you sleeping?

172
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,920
今晚太离奇了
Well, it's been a crazy night.

173
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,100
泰勒被杀了
Tyler was murdered.

174
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,160
泰勒
Tyler?

175
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,670
我和夏洛特发现他的
Me and Charlotte found him.

176
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,890
丹尼尔浑身是血地从一个沙丘后突然出现
And Daniel pops up from a dune, covered in blood.

177
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,300
太  太不可思议了
That's-- that's insane.

178
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,180
-你  你没事吧  -没事
- Are-- are you okay? - Fine.

179
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,780
不过夏洛特已经筋疲力尽了
Charlotte's a wreck, though.

180
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,870
她告诉警察她在沙滩上看到一个穿着
She told the cops that she saw some guy in a hoodie

181
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,910
连帽衫的人在泰勒的尸体旁边
on the beach by Tyler's body.

182
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,020
那你呢
What about you?

183
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,770
我离得太远了
I was too far away.

184
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,650
没看清他的脸
I didn't get a good look at his face.

185
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,420
我去睡了
I'm gonna crash.

186
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,080
你在干什么
What are you doing?

187
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,370
寻找答案
Looking for answers.

188
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,510
这是什么
What is this?

189
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,130
不知道  肯定是上一任屋主的
I don't know. It must belong to the previous owner.

190
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,240
你怎么
How did you--

191
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,090
泰勒告诉我说你一直在玩弄我
Tyler told me you've been playing me,

192
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,410
还说你在地板下面藏有秘密
that you had secrets hidden underneath the floorboards.

193
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,190
丹尼尔
Daniel,

194
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,600
泰勒疯了
Tyler was crazy.

195
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,560
他是个骗子
He was a liar.

196
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,690
他用枪指着我们
He held us at gunpoint.

197
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,490
你说得对  我很抱歉
You're right. I'm sorry.

198
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,670
不
No.

199
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,680
你不必道歉
You don't need to apologize.

200
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,780
你受伤了  是心理创伤
You're injured, you're traumatized.

201
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,700
我爱你  丹尼尔
I love you, Daniel.

202
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,840
无论发生什么事我都会陪着你
I'm gonna be by your side no matter what.

203
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,350
来吧  你需要好好睡一觉
Come on. You need to get some sleep.

204
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:40,150
《复仇》  第一季第十六集

205
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:49,760
眼下
As of now,

206
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,950
丹尼尔还未受到任何指控
Daniel hasn't been charged with anything.

207
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,080
我们只知道
All we know is,

208
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,410
泰勒・巴罗似乎是中枪而死
Tyler Barrol appears to have been shot to death

209
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,090
而丹尼尔神志不清  浑身是血
and Daniel was found unconscious at the scene

210
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,730
出现在了现场
with some blood on him.

211
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,580
大家都在等待法医的验尸报告
Everyone's waiting on the coroner's report

212
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,750
以及你的指纹比对结果
as well as the results from your fingerprint

213
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,910
和枪击残留物测试结果
and gunshot residue test.

214
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,640
直到这些结果出来之前
Until those come back,

215
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,860
我们都不知道要辩护的是什么罪名
we won't know what we're up against.

216
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,040
布鲁克斯先生
Mr. Brooks,

217
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,450
我想告诉你我们不胜感激
I want to tell you how grateful we are

218
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,420
你同意做丹尼尔的辩护律师
that you've agreed to represent Daniel

219
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,460
我和我丈夫可以协助你
and that you can count on my husband and I

220
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,910
并肩作战
to work as a team.

221
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,130
你丈夫呢
Where is your husband?

222
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,130
布鲁克斯先生很宽容  没有质疑你的缺席
Mr. Brooks was kind enough not to question your absence,

223
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,540
但我可没这么好说话
but I am not feeling so indulgent.

224
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,350
我都没睡过觉  我很累
I haven't slept. I'm tired.

225
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,060
我也不想让我们的往事笼罩着那间房
And I didn't want our history clouding the room.

226
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,870
197次航班的
246 fatalities

227
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,230
爆炸造成了246起死亡
in the bombing of Flight 197.

228
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,230
加上许多下落不明的人
The final death toll will likely surge

229
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,290
最终的死亡人数可能会更多
to include the many unaccounted for...

230
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,500
康拉德  你还好吗
Conrad, are you all right?

231
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,770
在现场
On the ground.

232
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,860
一组国内的暴力激进分子
A homegrown group of violent radicals...

233
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,700
怎么了
What is it?

234
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,140
声称自己是反美倡议联盟
Calling themselves the Americon Initiative...

235
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:54,300
我犯了一个很严重很严重的错
I've made a terrible, terrible mistake.

236
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,280
总统昨晚受这条消息的启迪
The president, awakened last night to news...

237
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:02,320
你知道那架坠毁的飞机  197次航班吗
Uh, you know the plane that went down, Flight 197?

238
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,900
我要为此负责的
I'm responsible.

239
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,020
你到底在说什么
What on earth are you talking about?

240
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,930
那个声称要为爆炸案负责的组织
That group that claimed responsibility for the bombing,

241
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,430
我在给他们洗黑钱
I was laundering money for them.

242
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,980
康拉德
Conrad.

243
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,470
案件调查会联系到公司
The investigation's gonna tie back to the company.

244
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,730
我下半辈子都要蹲监狱了
I'm gonna go to prison for the rest of my life,

245
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:22,820
这还是运气好的情况
if I'm lucky.

246
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,730
他们会冻结我们所有的资产
They're gonna freeze all of our assets,

247
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,460
而你就要在别人耻笑的眼光下
and you're gonna have to raise Daniel alone

248
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,360
独自一人抚养丹尼尔长大了
under a cloud of disgrace.

249
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,690
我们之前过的日子  维多利亚
Life as we know it, Victoria,

250
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,300
已经结束了
is over.

251
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,630
无论我们多想逃离过去
No matter how much we try to escape our past,

252
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,300
似乎命中注定历史会重演
we seem destined to repeat it.

253
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,870
不管你喜不喜欢  我们要共同面对
Like it or not, we are in this together,

254
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,260
再一次的
again.

255
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,680
很高兴见到你  老朋友
Good to see you, old timer.

256
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,830
好孩子
Good boy.

257
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,300
杰克
Jack.

258
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,310
你现在不是该在
Shouldn't you be on a boat

259
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,060
去海地的船上吗
halfway to Haiti right now?

260
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,950
我的引擎不给力
Yeah, well, my engine had other ideas.

261
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,150
你还好吗
You okay?

262
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,460
我没事
Yeah, I'm fine.

263
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,750
我担心的是丹尼尔
It's Daniel I'm worried about.

264
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,860
警察在对他严加审问
The police were questioning him pretty hard.

265
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,960
他们还有其他嫌疑人吗
Do they have any other suspects?

266
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,200
不知道  他们什么都不肯告诉我们
I don't know. They're not really keeping us in the loop.

267
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,500
德克兰怎么样
How's Declan?

268
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,020
找到泰勒的尸体一定是段糟糕的经历
Finding Tyler's body must have been pretty awful.

269
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,180
他  他看着挺冷静的  但是
Yeah, he's, uh, he's playing it cool, but...

270
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,100
我不相信
I'm not buying it.

271
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,400
阿曼达不会碰巧找过你吧
You haven't heard from Amanda, by any chance, have you?

272
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,370
没有
No.

273
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,740
还是没联系上她吗
Still no luck getting ahold of her?

274
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,620
没有  她的手机打不通
No, her phone's disconnected.

275
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,510
不管怎样  多谢你
Anyway, thank you

276
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,650
照顾山姆了
for looking after Sammy.

277
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,780
乐意效劳
Anytime.

278
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,220
我要看一下杰克船上发生什么事了
I need to see what happened on Jack's boat.

279
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,390
他没有离开镇子
He never left town.

280
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:10,030
什么  他现在应该都到外滩群岛附近了
What? He should be down around the Outer Banks by now.

281
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,510
可他出现在了我家门廊上
Try my back porch.

282
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:14,110
不可能  我发誓他离开港口了
No, I swear, he left the harbor.

283
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,120
我看到的  或者说
I saw him or...

284
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,580
至少小鲸鱼看见了
at least, uh, Shamu did.

285
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,000
看到没  我跟你说的没错吧
See? What did I tell you?

286
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,500
杰克
Jack!

287
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,200
杰克  等等
Jack, wait!

288
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,500
阿曼达
Amanda?

289
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,360
你怎么来这了
What are you doing here?

290
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,450
我的错  亲爱的
Mea culpa, babe.

291
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,270
杰克说船的引擎出了问题
Jack said he had engine trouble

292
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,050
而他最后一次见阿曼达是在上星期
and the last time he saw Amanda was last week.

293
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:41,990
他为什么要对我撒谎
Why would he lie to me?

294
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,930
有可能是为了隐瞒阿曼达惹的什么祸
Probably because he's covering up another one of her messes.

295
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,370
跟他谈谈  看能否问出阿曼达为何回来
Talk to him. See if you can find out why Amanda came back.

296
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,820
还有她现在的藏身何处  对吗
And where she's been hiding, right?

297
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,180
这一点尤其要弄清楚
Especially that.

298
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,780
夏洛特  你在干吗呢
Hey, Charlotte, what are you doing?

299
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,930
我昨晚几乎没怎么睡
I barely slept last night.

300
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,380
头疼得要命
My head is pounding.

301
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,870
你不知道这几天我过的是什么日子
You've no idea what these past few days have been like for me,

302
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,650
发现大卫・克拉克是我生亲
finding out David Clarke is my father,

303
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,940
而现在丹尼尔又被卷入
and now Daniel getting wrapped up

304
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,180
泰勒的命案调查之中
in Tyler's murder investigation,

305
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,290
我还在后怕  我们当时很有可能
knowing how close we probably came

306
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,860
也会死在那个可怕的
to getting killed, too...

307
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,960
穿连帽衫的家伙手里
by that creepy guy in the hoodie.

308
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,000
或许你应该再去咨询那位心理医生
Uh, well, maybe you should call that shrink again.

309
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,600
你上次说她帮了很大的忙
You said she really helped last time.

310
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,340
跟人倾诉并不那么有效
Talking's overrated.

311
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,000
难道嗑药就有效吗
And taking pills isn't?

312
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,560
你昨晚嗑药了是吗
Were you high last night?

313
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,050
别这样  夏洛特
Come on, Charlotte.

314
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,950
你现在更应该保持冷静
You're supposed to be the smart one here.

315
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,260
而你应该站在我这边
And you're supposed to be on my side.

316
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:45,780
你要去哪
Where are you going?

317
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,070
我这周末已经被质问得够多了
I've had enough interrogation for one weekend.

318
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:57,360
汉普顿花花公子谋杀案登上名人法庭

319
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,630
我们真该去巴黎的
We should've gone to Paris.

320
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,640
我知道
I know.

321
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,350
真抱歉
I'm so sorry.

322
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,930
我们是汉普顿警局的
Hamptons Police Department.

323
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,520
请稍等
Just a minute.

324
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,690
他们会刁难我的吧
They're gonna fry me, aren't they?

325
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,960
不  不会的
No. No.

326
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,460
不  我不会允许他们那么做的  好吗
No, I'm not gonna let that happen, okay?

327
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,760
索恩女士  我们是汉普顿警局的
Ms. Thorne, Hamptons Police Department.

328
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,060
好吗
Okay?

329
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,130
索恩女士  我们受命逮捕丹尼尔
Ms. Thorne, we have a warrant for Daniel's arrest.

330
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,520
请现在就开门
Open the door now.

331
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,600
就是他
That's him.

332
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,540
丹尼尔・格雷森
Daniel Grayson,

333
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,870
现以谋杀泰勒・巴罗的嫌疑逮捕你
you're under arrest for the murder of Tyler Barrol.

334
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,990
-你不必...  -退后
- You don't have to-- - Stay back.

335
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,070
丹尼尔  你们别碰我儿子
Daniel. Take your hands off my son!

336
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,170
艾米莉的枪上有丹尼尔的指纹
Daniel's fingerprints were found on Emily's gun.

337
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,770
他以前拿过那把枪很多次
He handled that gun a dozen times.

338
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,280
他的手上也检测出了开枪火药残留
His hands were tested positive for gunshot residue.

339
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,930
他燕尾服上溅到的血
The blood splatter on his tuxedo

340
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,940
和泰勒的血型一致
was the same type as Tyler's.

341
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,410
鉴于现在的政治局势
In a political climate like this,

342
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,490
检察官认定这是一级谋杀案
the D.A. goes first-degree murder.

343
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,220
好吧  现在你该告诉我们
All right, it's time you told us

344
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,600
那天海滩上发生的一切了  孩子
everything that happened on that beach, son.

345
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,340
没关系
It's okay.

346
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,040
说吧
Do it.

347
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,930
泰勒当时满口胡言  挥舞着那把枪
Tyler was talking crazy, waving the gun around.

348
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:37,360
我们扭打起来  我设法抢到了枪
We had a struggle, and I managed to get ahold of it.

349
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,600
然后他就冲我扑了过来
And then he charged at me.

350
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,190
接着说
Keep going.

351
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,860
于是我就开枪了
So I fired.

352
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,930
连发三枪吗
Three times?

353
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,930
就一枪  然后我昏过去了
Once, then I blacked out.

354
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:51,280
再然后  我就只记得妈妈在叫我
Next thing I remember was my mother calling my name.

355
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,130
泰勒身中三弹
Tyler was shot three times.

356
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,900
胸口一处  背后两处
Once in the chest, twice the back.

357
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,200
我没有对泰勒背后开枪
I didn't shoot Tyler in the back.

358
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,610
你怎么知道
How do you know?

359
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,280
我记得你说你昏过去了
I thought you said you blacked out.

360
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,700
你和泰勒扭打时
When you and Tyler struggled...

361
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,300
他打了你哪里
where did he hit you?

362
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,820
就在这  在头的侧面
Right here, on the side of the head.

363
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,630
你脑后有一处血肿
There's a hematoma on the back of your head.

364
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,430
如果你们是面对面打  很难伤到那里
That's a hard spot to reach if you're fighting face-to-face.

365
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,330
我们由此可以推断
We can use it to float the theory

366
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,080
海滩上另有人在
there was a third person on the beach

367
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,400
此人打昏你之后
that knocked you out,

368
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,240
构陷了你
set you up.

369
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:29,040
你们很有钱  招谁记恨了没有
You're rich. Who hates you--

370
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,750
比如心存不满的投资者或敌对的竞争对手
Disgruntled investors, hostile competitors?

371
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,210
阿曼达・克拉克
Amanda Clarke.

372
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,080
好极了
Ah. Great.

373
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,460
我们上哪能找到她
Where can we find her?

374
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,720
格雷森夫人  格雷森夫人
Mrs. Grayson. Mrs. Grayson.

375
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,400
你儿子将面临牢狱之灾
How does it feel to have your son

376
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,890
对此你有何感想
facing life in prison?

377
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,640
格雷森先生  此事对格雷森国际的股票
Mr. Grayson, what affect will a murder trial

378
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,470
-会造成什么影响  -格雷森夫人
- have on Grayson Global stock? - Mrs. Grayson.

379
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,940
格雷森家族对此不予置评
The Grayson family have no comment...

380
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,240
你认为行凶的是你儿子吗
Do you think your son did it?

381
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:01,270
他们只想声明  丹尼尔是无辜的
except to say that Daniel is innocent of the charges

382
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:04,350
他们坚信司法会还他一个公道
and they're sure that justice will be served.

383
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,230
阿曼达
Amanda?

384
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,080
维多利亚
Victoria.

385
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,450
进来吧
Come on in.

386
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:55,120
你和丹尼尔决定结婚的时候
Well, when you and Daniel decided to get married,

387
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,660
恐怕没想到你们订婚时
you probably never would've dreamed that your engagement

388
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:00,720
会牵扯到一桩命案的调查
would have included a... murder investigation.

389
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,760
没人想得到
I don't think anyone could imagine

390
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,360
会有这么可怕的事发生
something so horrible.

391
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,160
鉴于现状
Well, under the circumstances,

392
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,100
如果你想要重新考虑你们未来的关系
I would understand if you were reevaluating

393
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,550
我是能够理解的
the future of your relationship.

394
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,280
所以
So...

395
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,990
这是我送你们的订婚礼物
this is my engagement present to the two of you.

396
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,980
你想让我现在就打开吗
You want me to open it now?

397
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,940
不
No.

398
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,750
我想让你原封不动地收着它
I want you to hold on to it.

399
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,460
我想确认无论丹尼尔未来的路多么艰难
And I need to know that you'll stand by Daniel's side

400
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,730
你都会在他身边予以支持
no matter how rough the road gets.

401
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,230
如果你抛弃了他
If you abandon him,

402
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,890
公众舆论会对他的清白产生怀疑
it'll send a very public message about his innocence.

403
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:48,280
实话说  我从没想过要离开他
Honestly, that never even crossed my mind.

404
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,230
艾米莉
Emily.

405
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,530
维多利亚
Victoria.

406
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,430
我们都还在警察局的时候
Why did you come back to this house

407
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,610
你为何独自回这座房子来
when we were all at the police station?

408
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,700
我知道他们会没收丹尼尔身上那套衣服
I knew that they would take Daniel's suit.

409
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,770
我想确保他们没收了之后
I wanted to make sure that he had a change of clothing

410
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,290
丹尼尔有衣服换
for when they did.

411
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,210
想得真周到
Well, that was quick thinking.

412
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,610
或许你在少管所的经历
Maybe your time in the juvenile detention facility

413
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:18,050
在丹尼尔上庭受审时会有所帮助
will end up being an asset in Daniel's court case.

414
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,300
我有一个疑问  不知道还能去问谁
I got a problem and I don't know where else to go.

415
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:37,970
你怎么找到这儿的
Uh, oh, welcome to the Cone of Silence.

416
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,400
你知道这是什么吗
You know what this is?

417
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:45,270
一张五百万美金的电汇凭证
A... wire receipt for $5 million.

418
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,200
有人从南安普顿信托公司
Someone sent it from the Southampton Trust

419
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,010
汇款到蒙特利尔外的一个小银行
to a small bank outside of Montreal.

420
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,470
我给银行打过电话
I called the bank, but I couldn't get 'em

421
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,380
但他们没向我透露汇款人的任何信息
to give me any information on who it came from.

422
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,270
是你汇的吗
Was it you?

423
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,210
不是
No.

424
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,800
那一定是格雷森家的人干的
Then it must have been the Graysons.

425
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,540
我觉得这一定和海滩上发生的事有关
I think this had something to do with what happened on the beach.

426
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,290
是吗  你真想要卷入谋杀案的调查中吗
Oh, really, 'cause you want to get wrapped up in a murder investigation?

427
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,120
我已经深陷其中了
I already am.

428
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,930
这凭证是在阿曼达的外套里发现的
The receipt was in Amanda's jacket.

429
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,130
我记得你说过她已经离开了
I thought you said she left.

430
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,760
我准备出发的那天晚上  她突然出现了
She showed up the other night as I was heading out.

431
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,930
我们都准备好去海地了  她却忽然走了
We were all set to go to Haiti, and she took off.

432
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,290
诺兰
Nolan...

433
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,530
诺兰  我跟踪她到了海滩
Nolan, I followed her to the beach.

434
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,920
我找了她好几个小时
I spent hours looking for her.

435
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,630
把周围都找遍了
I-I--driving around.

436
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,190
她就那样不见了
She was gone.

437
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,740
她可能直接去了加拿大
Probably straight to Canada

438
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,480
去取这五百万了吧
to collect the $5 million.

439
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,750
既然你问我的意见
You asked for my advice

440
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,630
那我就直说了
so I'm not gonna sugarcoat it.

441
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,820
把这个凭证扔了  让这件事过去吧
Throw away the receipt and let it go.

442
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,870
顺便
And while you're at it,

443
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,450
把阿曼达也忘了吧
why don't you let Amanda go, too?

444
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,770
我不能那么做
I can't do that.

445
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,160
杰克
Jack!

446
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,260
我是艾米莉  有事请留言
This is Emily. Leave a message.

447
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,630
速回电
Call me...

448
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,430
尽快
ASAP.

449
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,260
这件事得坐下好好商量
You're gonna want to sit down for this one.

450
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,550
你相信是丹尼尔杀了泰勒吗
Do you believe Daniel killed Tyler?

451
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,650
当然不信
Of course not.

452
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,740
网上流传的关于他的那些事
The stuff they're saying about him online,

453
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,400
根本就不像在说他  而是另一个截然不同的人  
it's like they're talking about a completely different person.

454
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,140
都是一派胡言
They are.

455
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,550
我真希望能做点什么帮帮他
I just wish there was something I could do to help him.

456
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,030
当你发现大卫・克拉克干了那些万恶之事后
Is this what it was like for you when you found out

457
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,060
是不是也是这种感觉
David Clarke did all those hideous things?

458
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:42,510
每次看着我的时候  你都会想到他吗
Do you think about him every time you look at me?

459
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,320
夏洛特
Charlotte.

460
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,800
妈妈  我想要了解他
I want to know about him, mom,

461
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,460
他和你在一起的时候是什么样的人
what kind of person he was when he was with you.

462
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,940
感觉你我之间相隔了千万里
It feels like you're a million miles away.

463
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,210
要真是这样就好了
If only.

464
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:01,270
我的阿姨夏洛特在堪萨斯州有一个农场
You know, my aunt Charlotte has a farm in Kansas--

465
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,010
有50英亩
50 acres.

466
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:06,050
我们可以收拾好行李  今晚就走
We could pack our bags and leave tonight.

467
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,930
我不能把丹尼尔留给康拉德
I can't leave Daniel with Conrad.

468
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:15,020
我们可以把孩子也带上
Well, we can pack two bags, bring the kids with us.

469
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,060
当康拉德发现我们的事情后
Besides, when Conrad finds out about us,

470
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,520
我也没法待在华尔街了
I'm gonna be finished on Wall Street.

471
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:24,250
无论如何我都得走人了
I'm gonna be packing my bags regardless.

472
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,560
所以才不能让任何人发现我们的事情  大卫
Well, that's why no one can find out about us, David.

473
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,990
我经历过那种生活
I've lived that life before,

474
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,270
我再也不想过那种日子了
and I can't live it again.

475
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,910
那爱情呢
Well... what about love?

476
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,210
没了爱情你还能活吗
Can you live without that?

477
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,330
我保证总有一天我会告诉你一切
I promise to tell you everything one day,

478
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,640
但今天不行
but today is not the day.

479
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:49,120
你得好好想想你在海滩上看到的那个人
I need you to think hard about that person you saw on the beach.

480
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,390
也许会想起一些你之前没注意到的细节
You might remember things that you don't realize.

481
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,740
你听懂了吗
Do you understand me?

482
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,450
你哥哥可能就命悬于此
Your brother's life may depend on it.

483
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,040
我收到留言了  有什么重要的事
I got your message. What's so important?

484
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,310
杰克在阿曼达的外套里发现了电汇凭证
Jack found the wire transfer receipt in Amanda's jacket.

485
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,580
你知道阿曼达向他透露了多少吗
Did you find out how much Amanda told him?

486
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,860
听起来在她离开之前
It doesn't sound like she had a lot of time

487
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,770
没什么时间和杰克聊天
to chat before she took off.

488
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:11,630
你有没有发现
You ever notice how,

489
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,940
她总像嗜杀女郎版的地鼠一样
whenever you want her to leave,

490
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,440
每次你想她离开时
girlfriend keeps popping up

491
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,470
她就会突然冒出来
like the homicidal stripper version of whac-a-mole,

492
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,520
但每次你要找她时
but whenever you need to find her,

493
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,820
她就消失了
she vanishes?

494
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:23,060
还让杰克越陷越深
And manages to pull Jack even deeper into trouble.

495
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,500
索恩小姐
Ms. Thorne?

496
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,170
我等下给你回电话
I'll call you back.

497
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,140
布鲁克斯先生
Mr. Brooks.

498
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,790
很抱歉冒昧来访
I apologize for the ambush,

499
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,310
但我希望能和你单独谈谈
but I wanted to speak to you alone.

500
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,810
恕我直言
To be perfectly blunt,

501
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,310
我掌握丹尼尔越多的丑闻
the more dirt I have on Daniel,

502
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,750
我就能更从容地面对对方的攻辩
the better prepared I'll be when the fur starts flying.

503
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,600
原来是来找家丑的啊
Ah. Looking for skeletons.

504
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,630
家丑  毒瘾
Skeletons, addictions,

505
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,310
私情
secret relationships,

506
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,780
癖性
proclivities.

507
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:51,600
真是直言不讳啊
Wow. You are blunt.

508
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,100
你的未婚夫有可能被判谋杀罪
Your fiance's facing a murder charge.

509
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,590
现在可不是拐弯抹角的时候
This isn't the time for subtlety.

510
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,910
维多利亚坚信阿曼达・克拉克
Victoria is convinced Amanda Clarke had something to do

511
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:02,490
与海滩上发生的那件事有关系
with what happened on that beach.

512
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,860
你最近有见到她吗
Have you had any run-ins with her?

513
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,490
今年夏天我才认识她
I just met her this summer.

514
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:09,360
其实她以前在这房子里住过
She used to live in this house, actually.

515
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,570
她来过一次
She came by once

516
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,730
寻找儿时的回忆
looking for childhood memories.

517
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,730
你觉得她会恨格雷森家恨到
Do you believe she hates the Graysons enough

518
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,870
要把谋杀罪栽赃给丹尼尔吗
to frame Daniel for murder?

519
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,400
我觉得你得去找她
I think you'd have to find her

520
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,470
然后问她
And ask her.

521
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,460
我所知道的只是
All I know is,

522
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:27,510
她是个麻烦缠身的人
she's a very troubled girl.

523
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,820
我已经在调查她的行踪了
I already have my investigators on it.

524
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,050
谢谢配合  索恩小姐
Thank you, Ms. Thorne.

525
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,520
布鲁克斯先生
Mr. Brooks.

526
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,900
既然我们都如此坦诚
Since we're being candid...

527
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,950
我想有些事情应该让你知道
I think there is something you should know.

528
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:45,200
是关于丹尼尔还是阿曼达的
About Daniel or Amanda?

529
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,350
关于格雷森家的
About the Graysons.

530
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,650
我知道近几年
I understand Daniel got into a few scrapes

531
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:56,590
丹尼尔惹了一些麻烦
over the last few years.

532
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,690
但在他这个年纪
Like anyone his age,

533
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,710
年轻人总会有些鲁莽
he's had a few youthful indiscretions.

534
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,540
那你和康纳德是怎么处理这些鲁莽的呢
And what role did you and Conrad play in those indiscretions?

535
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,180
我不懂你在说什么
I'm not sure I follow you.

536
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,380
你们真以为我不会发现
Did you honestly believe I wouldn't find out

537
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,180
去年夏天  你们花钱买通法官
you paid off a judge last summer

538
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,780
减轻了丹尼尔酒驾和过失伤害罪的判罚吗
to downgrade daniel's D.U.I. And reckless endangerment charges?

539
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,880
你从哪里听说到这些的
Where on earth did you hear this?

540
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,520
是我告诉他的
I told him.

541
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,940
我以为你是站在丹尼尔这边的
I thought you were on Daniel's side.

542
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,680
还是说那只是个诡计
Or was that just a ruse?

543
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,630
就我而言  艾米莉是这里唯一一个
As far as I'm concerned, Emily is the only one here

544
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,570
真正关心丹尼尔利益的人
who seems to have Daniel's best interests at heart.

545
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,870
没有人比我更爱我的儿子
No one loves my son more than I do.

546
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:29,180
要是控方律师
What if the prosecution

547
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,440
拿这案子攻我不备怎么办
had blindsided me with that mid-trial?

548
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,250
我们处理得很谨慎
We were very discreet.

549
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,630
那女孩差点死掉
That girl was almost killed.

550
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,820
她哥拿着9寸长的铁撬往丹尼尔的车上砸
Her brother took a 9-iron to Daniel's Aston Martin.

551
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,820
[阿斯顿・马丁  英国豪华轿车品牌]

552
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:39,140
很多人心知肚明
Many people know exactly what you did.

553
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,560
每个人都想在1%的富人中
Everyone's looking for a member

554
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,080
找到一个能穷追猛打的人
of the 1% to smack down,

555
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:45,180
而丹尼尔正成为了他们的目标
and Daniel is tailor-made to take that fall.

556
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,000
除非你们准备跟我说实话
So unless you're ready to level with me,

557
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,020
否则我还不如去辛尼克山[美国一高级俱乐部]
I might as well be up at Shinnecock Hills

558
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,250
练网球好了
practicing my backswing.

559
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:55,130
当然  布鲁克斯先生
Of course, Mr. Brooks.

560
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,720
从现在起  
From here on out, you'll have

561
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,970
我们将坦诚相待  绝无保留
complete and utter candor from both of us.

562
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:04,180
阿曼达・克拉克那有线索吗
Do you have any leads on Amanda Clarke?

563
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:05,890
还在查
Still working on it.

564
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,850
你知道她和经营偷渡者酒吧的
Did you know that she dated that young man

565
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,880
年轻人交往过吗
who runs the Stowaway Tavern in Montauk?

566
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,750
名叫杰克・波特
His name is Jack Porter.

567
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,220
我会去找他的
I'll pay him a visit.

568
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,390
但我现在更关心的
But my more immediate concern

569
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,020
是订婚宴的监控录像
is the security tapes from the party.

570
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,450
怎么了
What now?

571
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:21,010
很明显  它们被篡改了
Apparently, they were tampered with.

572
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,970
那晚监控录像的大部分
Kept on a 3-minute loop

573
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,490
都重复播着特定的三分钟
for the bulk of the evening.

574
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,600
那对我们有什么影响吗
And how does that impact us?

575
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,100
控方会使之看起来像是
The prosecution will make it look like

576
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,350
丹尼尔事先动了手脚
Daniel engineered it

577
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,960
这样没人会看见他杀死泰勒
so no one would see him kill Tyler.

578
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,800
你为武田聪工作多久了
How long have you been working for Takeda?

579
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,200
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

580
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,080
我知道是你弄坏了订婚宴的安保摄像头
I know you disabled the security cameras at the party.

581
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,160
一看就是为了掩盖武田聪
It's got Takeda's stamp all over it.

582
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,930
要我再给你点颜色瞧瞧吗
Do I really need to kick your ass again?

583
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,140
他是怎么收买你的
How did he recruit you?

584
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,390
好吧我说
Okay.

585
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,820
今夏早些时候   
He cozied up to me

586
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,900
他在投资者聚会上刻意接近我
at the investors' shindig earlier this summer.

587
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:56,170
他要我照看你
He wanted me to look out for you.

588
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:57,870
你为什么没跟我说
Why didn't you tell me?

589
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,480
因为他叫我保密
Because he told me not to,

590
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,970
而且他很令人信服
and he can be very convincing.

591
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,510
很抱歉  艾米
I'm sorry, Ems.

592
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,720
不  知道吗  是我的错
No, you know what? It's my fault.

593
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,500
我不该让你深陷此事
I should never have brought you so deep into this.

594
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,190
现在说这些
Well, it's a little late to put that genie

595
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:11,990
为时已晚了
back in the infinity box.

596
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,420
我们现在手上有比你的忠诚问题
Anyway, we have more pressing problems

597
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,660
更棘手的事要解决
than your loyalty issues.

598
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,340
格雷森家的人在找阿曼达
The Graysons are on a mission to find Amanda.

599
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:20,270
但找到她之前  他们肯定会先抓个
Until they do, they're gonna be looking for a fall guy

600
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,910
更近的替罪羊
closer to home.

601
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,990
杰克
Jack.

602
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,840
达文波特女士  格雷森家族是如何
Ms. Davenport, how are the Graysons holding up

603
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,820
度过这段艰难时期的
during this very difficult time?

604
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,850
他们深受打击
They're devastated.

605
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:34,670
丹尼尔・格雷森被捕是极其不公正的
Daniel Grayson's arrest is a terrible injustice.

606
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:35,480
我们提出的证据
The evidence will show

607
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,830
不仅能为丹尼尔洗脱嫌疑
that not only did Daniel not commit the crime,

608
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,190
还能证明当晚在海边有第三者
but that there was another person on the beach that night

609
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,120
他既有动机也有能力
who had both the motive and the means

610
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:45,290
杀死泰勒・巴罗  并嫁祸给丹尼尔
to murder Tyler Barrol and frame Daniel for the crime.

611
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,660
格雷森家族悬赏十万美金
The Grayson family are offering a $100,000 reward

612
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,740
奖励提供凶手线索的群众
for any information leading to the conviction of the killer.

613
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,060
夏洛特
Charlotte.

614
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,880
还好吗
Is everything okay?

615
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,460
从这看海滩最美了
This is the prettiest spot on the beach.

616
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,030
如此的平静
It's so peaceful.

617
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:28,100
是啊  我很幸运
Yeah, I really lucked out.

618
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,060
不敢相信  我从小就有个姐姐就住在隔壁
Hard to believe I grew up with a sister right next door

619
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,810
而我却浑然不知
and I never had any idea.

620
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:41,050
你觉得她早就知道真相吗
Do you think she knew the truth this whole summer?

621
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,240
我妈妈觉得是
My mother thinks she did.

622
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,220
我真的有好多问题想问她
There's just so much I want to ask her

623
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:49,290
关于她的生活  她父亲
about her life, her father...

624
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:52,250
我们的父亲
Our father.

625
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,310
但现在看来已经没机会了
But chances are, that won't happen now.

626
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,800
这就是你嗑药的原因吗
Is that why you've been taking those pills?

627
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,390
你知道吗
You know...

628
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,960
杰克和阿曼达有天来我家时
Jack and Amanda came over one day and...

629
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,110
告诉我这秋千是你爸亲手做的
They told me that your father built this swing.

630
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,440
他不可能完全是那么坏的人
He couldn't have been all bad.

631
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,240
杰克  有时间聊两句吗
Hey, Jack, you got a sec?

632
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,830
行  什么事
Yeah. What's up?

633
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,940
还记得我九岁那年
Do you remember when I was 9,

634
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,170
我和吉米・史密森在这玩飞盘
and me and Jimmy Smithson were playing frisbee in the bar.

635
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:53,580
我把爸爸最爱的啤酒标志弄坏了
And I broke dad's favorite beer sign?

636
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,920
钟旁边有霓虹灯的那个吗
The neon one with the clock?

637
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,070
对  爸大发脾气
Yeah, and dad went ballistic.

638
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:01,210
我第一次见到有人真会气得脸色发青
You know, I-I'd never seen somebody actually turn purple.

639
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,850
所以我跑回房间  开始收拾行李
So I ran up to my room, started packing a bag.

640
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,800
打算离家出走
You know, figuring I was gonna run away.

641
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,580
但你告诉他是你干的
And you told him you did it,

642
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,130
即使他把你摔在地上
even though he grounded you

643
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,120
不让你去阿迪朗达克山[位于纽约州]露营
and wouldn't let you go on that camping trip to the Adirondacks.

644
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:20,590
- 德克  - 听我说完
- Dec-- - No.

645
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,770
你是我见过的最善良正直的人
You are the most stand-up guy I know.

646
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,280
我见过你一次又一次地
I've seen you take the heat for other people

647
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,720
帮别人顶黑锅
over and over again,

648
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:26,910
但你这次失去的
but you got a lot more to lose here

649
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,600
可不仅仅是山上数日的风光
than a couple of days in the mountains.

650
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:32,620
我不在乎你在保护谁  为何要这样
And I-I don't care who you're protecting or why.

651
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,160
但从现在开始  由我来保护你
But as of now, I'm gonna start protecting you.

652
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,200
单一麦芽威士忌
Single malt.

653
00:31:58,670 --> 00:31:59,800
纯的
Neat.

654
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,290
就来
Coming up.

655
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:04,470
帮你照看酒吧的那漂亮女孩去哪了
Where's that pretty girl who tends bar?

656
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,470
阿曼达吗
Amanda, is it?

657
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,760
我们店季节性很大
Our business is seasonal.

658
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,370
夏天结束后  员工就去找新工作了
When the summer ends, people move on to the next gig.

659
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,210
每年都如此
Happens every year.

660
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,050
你俩曾交往过  对吗
You two were dating, right?

661
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,660
你问得太多了
You ask a lot of questions.

662
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,070
本杰明・布鲁克斯
Benjamin Brooks.

663
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,200
我是丹尼尔・格雷森的代理律师
I represent Daniel Drayson.

664
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,570
我还有个问题
I have another question for you.

665
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,670
周六晚上你在哪里
Where were you Saturday night?

666
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:31,030
我准备起航去海地
I was starting to sail to Haiti.

667
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,840
去帮助那儿的房屋重建
I was getting ready to help with the rebuilding there.

668
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,690
你太舍己为人了  何事让你耽搁了
Aren't you the altruist? What stopped you?

669
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,250
引擎故障
Engine trouble.

670
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,450
真可惜
That's a shame.

671
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,960
秋天快到了  再要去路途可就艰辛了
Pretty soon, fall will be here. It'll be too rough a trip.

672
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,180
你该抓住机会离开的
Should've left when you had the chance.

673
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,090
有阿曼达消息的话通知我
Let me know if you hear from Amanda.

674
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,670
我能帮你修好船让你傍晚离开
Oh, I can have your boat fixed and ready to go by nightfall.

675
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:01,090
逃避并不能解决问题
Running away is not gonna solve anything.

676
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,450
我得在格雷森之前找到她
And I gotta find Amanda before the Graysons do.

677
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:05,180
你打算怎么找
And how are you gonna do that?

678
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,290
还不知道
I don't know yet.

679
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,140
客户有罪对你来说重要吗
Does it matter to you if your clients are guilty?

680
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,570
我从不过问
I never ask.

681
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,420
好冷漠无情
Cynical.

682
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,460
我最不想的
The last thing I need

683
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,530
就是使我的判断受到影响
is to have my judgment clouded.

684
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:29,550
过去20年来  我一个案子都没输过
And in 20 years, I haven't lost a case,

685
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,250
所以如果这记录不被打破的话
so if ain't broke...

686
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,790
你对此案的看法是什么
What's your take on all this?

687
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,890
我觉得是丹尼尔杀死了泰勒
I think Daniel shot Tyler.

688
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:43,010
而且他能成功脱罪
And I think he's gonna get away with it.

689
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:46,490
而你还继续为格雷森家工作
And yet you continue to work for the Graysons.

690
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,830
我来自一个叫克里登的小镇
I come from a town called Croydon,

691
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,050
就在伦敦的边上
just outside of London.

692
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:53,850
由于无人关心  人口越来越少
Population--no one cares and dropping.

693
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,410
我想要的不仅仅是策划派对
I want more out of life than planning parties

694
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:58,230
或为别人打理日常琐事
and making sure other people's lives run smoothly,

695
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,460
可眼下
But for now...

696
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,520
这就是我的工作
It's my job.

697
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,970
你会很上镜的
The camera sure loves you.

698
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,560
你这步棋若走对了
You play your cards right,

699
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,150
就可以借着丹尼尔的审判大展宏图
you can parlay Daniel's trial into a whole new career.

700
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,840
不过话说回来
But then...

701
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,340
我想你已经明白这一点了
I think you already know that.

702
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,230
你好像需要有人相伴
Looks like you could use some company.

703
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,280
两个月前
Two months ago,

704
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,820
我们被《时代》评为完美夫妇
we were being heralded in "The Times." as a golden couple,

705
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,240
再看看现在
and now look at us.

706
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,360
一个孩子因为谋杀被逮捕
One child arrested for murder,

707
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,900
另一个则用鄙视的目光看着我们
and the other can't look at us without contempt,

708
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:42,000
我俩离了婚却还住在同一屋檐下
Divorced but living under the same roof.

709
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,020
至少这屋檐下有两万平方英尺
At least it's a 20,000-square-foot roof.

710
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,170
我们不至于相互绊倒对方
It's not like we'll be tripping over each other.

711
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:47,970
是两万四平方英尺
24,000.

712
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,960
我们怎么会落到如此地步
Oh. How the hell did we get here?

713
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,440
我也不知道
Mm. I don't know.

714
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,630
我想这就是所谓的多米诺效应
I believe it's called the domino effect.

715
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,830
一件事牵扯到另一件事
You know, one move begets another,

716
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,310
于是在你还未觉察之前
and then before you know it...

717
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,820
它们全倒下了
they all fall down.

718
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,150
我很担心
I'm worried.

719
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,870
监狱不是丹尼尔这种人能待的
Jail is no place for a boy like Daniel.

720
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:20,800
在这个世上
There is a perception

721
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,650
很多人有这样一种观念
in this part of the world

722
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:26,500
认为钱权能使鬼推磨
that power and money exert undue influence.

723
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,850
但我明确地告诉你们
I want it clear--

724
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,350
在我的法庭上
in my courtroom,

725
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,990
正义无价  法不阿贵
justice has no price tag.

726
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:36,010
我仔细审查了大量显示丹尼尔・格雷森
I have carefully examined the wealth of forensic evidence

727
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:39,040
与犯罪现场有关的法医证据
linking Daniel Grayson to the crime scene

728
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:42,700
同时考虑到格雷森家族
and taken into consideration the Grayson family's

729
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,680
用之不尽的资源
unlimited resources

730
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:47,230
例如私人飞机之类
as well as private planes.

731
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:50,290
加之此案的严重性
Given the serious nature of this crime,

732
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,710
我在此驳回丹尼尔・格雷森的
I hereby deny bail...

733
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,010
-我的天  -保释请求
- Oh , my God - for Daniel Grayson...

734
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:59,370
在等待审判期间  他将被押送至
And order him to be remanded to the maximum security

735
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:03,330
赖克斯岛最高安全级别的看守所
correctional facility on Rikers Island while he awaits trial.

736
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,450
丹尼尔  丹尼尔
Daniel. Daniel.

737
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,320
法警  请将被告人带走
Bailiff, would you please remove the defendant?

738
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,500
你们得做点什么
You gotta do something.

739
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:25,100
格雷森家是否将法官的裁决
Do the Graysons see the judge's ruling

740
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,100
视作一个巨大的挫败
as a huge defeat?

741
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,780
格雷森家族非常尊重
The Grayson family have the greatest respect

742
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,170
法庭关于拒绝保释丹尼尔的决定
for the court's decision regarding Daniel's bail.

743
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:33,140
但他们的确认为这是一个小挫折
But they do view this as a minor setback,

744
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,570
他们确信司法机关将会尽快纠正
and one they're sure the justice system will remedy

745
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:37,510
这个错误的
as quickly as possible.

746
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,930
我同时希望
I'd also like--

747
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:44,030
你哪儿也不会去了吧
You're not going anywhere, are you?

748
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,050
不  德克兰需要我
No, Declan needs me.

749
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:49,660
为家着想  值得赞扬啊
Oh, kudos for the family values.

750
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,950
可你这是犯了弥天大错
But you're making a colossal mistake.

751
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:56,570
你是不想要喝酒了吗
Does this mean you don't want a drink?

752
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,790
来两杯吧
Make it a double.

753
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,200
这个秋天长着呢
It's gonna be a long fall.

754
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:23,210
诺氏企业  技术部门
Nolcorp, I.T. Department,

755
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:24,790
我是诺兰
Hey, it's Nolan.

756
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:26,860
那些我们帮忙从网上撤下来的格雷森家的照片
Those photos we pulled down for the Graysons,

757
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:29,640
我要你找到这些照片的源头
I need you to find out where they originated.

758
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:42,610
逆境下会诞生意想不到的同盟
Adversity creates unexpected alliances...

759
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,720
但此时缔结的条约
But treaties of this nature

760
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,050
极少是平等公正的
seldom form with an equality of power.

761
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:02,260
这位不是
Well, here she is--

762
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,080
媒体的新宠儿吗
The media's new it girl.

763
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,500
对女王最爱的劳工来说
Mm. It's quite an upgrade

764
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,260
实在是一大飞跃啊
from the queen's favorite worker bee.

765
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:10,120
我想你叫我来不是要签名的吧
I take it you didn't summon me here for an autograph.

766
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,960
我很支持一举成名  阿什
I'm all for a meteoric rise, Ash,

767
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,910
不过  我跟着直觉
But, uh, I followed a hunch,

768
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,300
找到了轰动网络的
and sourced the scandal pics

769
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:19,360
丑闻照片的来源
that are blowing up the internet.

770
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:24,080
猜猜最后源头是在哪儿
And guess where the trail ends.

771
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,620
还有谁知道这事
Who else knows?

772
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,660
就我们俩
Just us...

773
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,520
暂时如此
For now.

774
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:35,710
从恐惧与不信任中建立起的忠诚
Loyalties forged in apprehension and mistrust...

775
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,210
薄如蝉翼
are tenuous at best...

776
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,700
在对抗无情的真相之光时
Easily broken when held up

777
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,690
就会轻易崩溃
to the unforgiving light of the truth.

778
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:56,430
但在最为绝望的黑暗之中
But in the darkness of our most desperate hours...

779
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,100
常常是这样的忠诚给予我们力量
It's often these loyalties that lend us the strength

780
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,270
完成必须要做的事
to do what we know must be done.

781
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:07,030
48小时前

782
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:16,440
你应该听从我警告的
You should've heeded my warning.

783
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,740
你都干了什么
What did you do?

784
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:28,740
是你缺少自我约束  才导致了这些混乱

785
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,030
海滩边到底发生了什么
What happened on the beach?

786
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,000
那个男的正要揭露你
The boy was going to expose you.

787
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:41,430
你逃不掉的  泰勒
You won't get away with this, Tyler.

788
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,580
我当然逃得掉
Sure I will,

789
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,910
可艾米莉就不会了
but Emily won't.

790
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,650
不
No!

791
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,260
别过来
Stay back!

792
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,820
也许你该先给艾米莉打个电话
Maybe you should call Emily first.

793
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,000
问她同不同意你扣动扳机
Ask her permission to pull the trigger.

794
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:06,780
她就是只披着羊皮的狼  你个蠢货
She's a wolf in sheep's clothing, you idiot.

795
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,240
而你就是只无助的小绵羊
And you're just a helpless little lamb

796
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,730
一步一步走向屠场
headed for the slaughter.

797
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,890
求求你  救救我
Please. Help me.

798
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:30,950
不要
No!

799
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,700
可那里还有别人
But there were others.

800
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:50,200
你叫她阿曼达的那个女孩
The girl you call Amanda.

801
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,480
她已经被妥善处理了
She has been taken care of.

802
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,860
阿曼达
Amanda!

803
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:56,300
然后
And then...

804
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,410
杰克
Jack.

805
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:02,100
另外那个你有好感的男孩
The other boy you have feelings for.

806
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,100
你可没法两个都救
You cannot save them both.

807
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,640
一颗充满疑问和困惑的矛盾之心
A conflicted heart feeds on doubt and confusion.

808
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:23,190
会让你怀疑你所选择的道路
It will make you question your path...

809
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:25,290
你的策略
Your tactics...

810
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:26,820
你的动机
Your motives.

811
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:39,930
当你举目远望  却只看到一片黑暗时
When you stare ahead and darkness is all you see,

812
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:42,500
只有理智和决心
only reason and determination

813
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,400
能将你拉出深渊
can pull you back from the abyss.
