As you can see, sir, all Dalek fleets surrounding the planet

143
00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:47,510
現在都匯聚到了首都 但天溝戰壕還能堅持
now converging on the capital,but the Sky Trenches are holding

144
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:53,432
他接下來去了哪兒?
Where did he go next?

145
00:10:53,443 --> 00:10:57,270
這重要嗎? 這是他們最猛烈的進攻 長官
What does it matter? This is their biggest ever attack, sir

146
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,730
- 他們向我們全力開火了
- 長官
- theyre throwing everything at us
- Sir

147
00:10:59,741 --> 00:11:02,494
時間之庫被人侵入了
we have a security breach to the Time Vaults

148
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:09,824
終極武器庫
The Omega Arsenal

149
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:12,118
所有被禁用的武器都封存在那兒
where all the forbidden weapons are locked away

150
00:11:12,128 --> 00:11:13,578
它們不再是被禁用的了
Theyre not forbidden any more

151
00:11:13,588 --> 00:11:15,705
已經全部被用來對付Dalek
weve used them all against the Daleks

152
00:11:15,715 --> 00:11:17,915
不
No

153
00:11:17,926 --> 00:11:19,803
不 不是全部
No, we havent

154
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:26,007
時間之匣不見了
The Moment is gone

155
00:11:26,017 --> 00:11:28,812
我不明白 時間之匣是什麼? 我從沒聽說過
I dont understand What is the Moment? Ive never heard of it

156
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,981
星際噬者
The galaxy eater

157
00:11:33,566 --> 00:11:35,766
Gallifrey先民的終極作品
The final work of the ancients of Gallifrey

158
00:11:35,777 --> 00:11:40,240
非常強大的武器 強大到它的操作系統發展出了感知能力
a weapon so powerful, the operating system became sentient

159
00:11:41,658 --> 00:11:43,983
根據傳說
According to legend

160
00:11:43,993 --> 00:11:45,610
它擁有了意識
it developed a conscience

161
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,361
我們從沒用過?
And weve never used it?

162
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:50,448
你要怎麼使用一件能對你做出評判的
How do you use a weapon of ultimate mass destruction

163
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,377
終極大規模殺傷性武器?
when it can stand in judgment on you?

164
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:57,340
只有一個人會嘗試
There is only one man who would even try

00:12:06,057 --> 00:12:10,687
Gallifrey之時間領主 Skaro之Dalek
Time Lords of Gallifrey, Daleks of Skaro

166
00:12:11,729 --> 00:12:13,690
這是給你們所有人的通知
I serve notice on you all

167
00:12:14,732 --> 00:12:18,570
我已經等待了太久 這一切必須結束
Too long I have stayed my hand
No more

168
00:12:19,988 --> 00:12:23,439
今天 你們讓我別無選擇
Today, you leave me no choice

169
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:26,703
今天 這場戰爭終將結束
Today, this war will end

170
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,497
終結
No more

171
00:12:30,915 --> 00:12:32,625
終結
No more

172
00:13:20,924 --> 00:13:22,634
怎麼
How

173
00:13:24,844 --> 00:13:26,930
怎麼操作?
how do you work?

174
00:13:28,097 --> 00:13:31,643
為什麼就不能有個大紅按鈕?
Why is there never a big red button?

175
00:13:42,487 --> 00:13:44,197
你好?
Hello?

176
00:13:45,573 --> 00:13:47,148
有人嗎?
Is somebody there?

177
00:13:47,158 --> 00:13:48,774
什麼也不是
Its nothing

178
00:13:48,785 --> 00:13:50,651
只是匹狼
Its just a wolf

179
00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:52,111
- 別坐那上面!
- 為什麼不行?
- Dont sit on that!
- Why not?

180
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,696
因為那不是椅子
Because its not a chair

181
00:13:53,706 --> 00:13:56,042
它是宇宙中最危險的武器
its the most dangerous weapon in the universe

182
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,465
怎麼不能也是椅子呢?
Why cant it be both?

183
00:14:05,677 --> 00:14:07,679
你為什麼停在那麼遠的地方?
Why did you park so far away?

184
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:11,088
你不想讓她見到嗎?
Didnt you want her to see it?

185
00:14:11,099 --> 00:14:12,798
讓誰?
Want who to see?

186
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:15,384
TARDIS
The TARDIS

187
00:14:15,395 --> 00:14:17,595
你走了很遠
You walked for miles

188
00:14:17,605 --> 00:14:20,264
很遠 很遠 很遠
And miles and miles and miles and miles

189
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:22,808
- 我在思考!
- 我聽到了
- I was thinking!
- I heard you

190
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:24,404
你聽到了?
You heard me?

191
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:28,158
終結
No more

192
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,525
終結
No more

193
00:14:30,535 --> 00:14:32,068
終結
No more

194
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:33,945
終結
No more

195
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:36,197
- 終結! 終結!
- 停下
- No more! No more!
- Stop it!

196
00:14:36,207 --> 00:14:39,200
- 終結
- 你是誰?
- No more
- Who are you?

197
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:45,039
它啟動了! 快離開這兒!
Its activating Get out of here!

198
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:46,958
怎麼了?
Whats wrong?

199
00:14:46,968 --> 00:14:48,793
操作界面很燙
The interface is hot

200
00:14:48,803 --> 00:14:50,805
好吧 我盡力了
Well, I do my best

201
00:14:52,515 --> 00:14:54,893
裡面有個能量源
Theres a power source inside

202
00:15:00,982 --> 00:15:02,598
你就是操作界面?
Youre the Interface?

203
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:05,612
他們肯定告訴過你時間之匣有意識
They must have told you the Moment had a conscience

204
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,782
你好!
Hello!

205
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:12,275
看看你
Oh, look at you

206
00:15:12,285 --> 00:15:14,277
被困在一個女孩和一個盒子之間
Stuck between a girl and a box

207
00:15:14,287 --> 00:15:16,404
一生都這樣吧 博士?
Story of your life, eh, Doctor?

208
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:17,999
你認識我?
You know me?

209
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:21,826
我聽到你
I hear you

210
00:15:21,836 --> 00:15:26,998
每一代的你 在你們那個又老又破的腦袋裡吵吵嚷嚷
All of you, jangling around in that dusty old head of yours

211
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:30,167
我特別為你選了這張臉和這個形態
I chose this face and form especially for you

212
00:15:30,178 --> 00:15:31,878
它來自你的過去
Its from your past

213
00:15:31,888 --> 00:15:34,714
或是你的未來 我總是把這兩個搞混
Or possibly your future - I always get those two mixed up

214
00:15:34,724 --> 00:15:36,132
我沒有未來
I don't have a future

215
00:15:36,142 --> 00:15:38,885
我想我叫
I think I'm called

216
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:41,137
Rose Tyler
Rose Tyler

217
00:15:41,147 --> 00:15:43,264
哦 不對 等下 抱歉
No, yes, no, sorry

218
00:15:43,274 --> 00:15:46,486
不不不 在這個形態 我叫
No, no, in this form Im called

219
00:15:49,197 --> 00:15:50,907
惡狼
Bad Wolf

220
00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:55,735
你怕大惡狼嗎 博士?
Are you afraid of the big bad wolf, Doctor?

221
00:15:55,745 --> 00:15:58,779
- 別再叫我博士了
- 你自己的意識裡就是這麼叫的
- Stop calling me Doctor
- Thats the name in your head

222
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,323
不應該是這樣的
It shouldnt be

223
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,783
這場戰爭我已經打了很久
Ive been fighting this war for a very long time

224
00:16:02,794 --> 00:16:06,037
我已經失去了被叫做博士的資格
Ive lost the right to be the Doctor

225
00:16:06,047 --> 00:16:09,332
那麼你就是傳說中救了我們所有人的那個
Then youre the one to save us all

226
00:16:09,342 --> 00:16:11,209
是的
Yes

227
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:14,180
如果我能發展出自負 那就是你了
If I ever develop an ego,youve got the job

228
00:16:22,063 --> 00:16:24,649
如果你曾經和我心靈相通
If you have been inside my head

229
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:28,486
那麼你就該知道我目睹過的一切
then you know what Ive seen

230
00:16:29,737 --> 00:16:30,905
我所經歷的痛苦
The suffering

231
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:35,525
時間和空間的每一寸都在燃燒
Every moment in time and space is burning

232
00:16:35,535 --> 00:16:38,528
這一切必須結束
It must end

233
00:16:38,538 --> 00:16:42,698
我將以我唯一能做到的方式終結它
And I intend to end it the only way I can

234
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:47,203
而你就用我來終結它? 把時間領主和Dalek
And youre going to use me to end it by killing them all

235
00:16:47,213 --> 00:16:49,997
全都殺死?
Daleks and Time Lords alike

236
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:54,752
我可以 但是你得承擔後果
I could, but there will be consequences for you

237
00:16:54,762 --> 00:16:57,891
我本就抱著必死之心
I have no desire to survive this

238
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:09,892
那麼這就是對你的懲罰
Then thats your punishment

239
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:15,283
如果你這麼做了--把他們都殺了-- 這就是所謂的後果
If you do this - if you kill them all
- then thats the consequence

240
00:17:19,454 --> 00:17:22,165
你會活下去
You live

241
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:26,409
Gallifrey
Gallifrey

242
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:30,496
你會燒掉Gallifrey
youre going to burn it

243
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:34,260
連同所有的Dalek 但也包括所有的孩子
and all those Daleks with it
but all those children too

244
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,307
Gallifrey上有多少孩子?
How many children on Gallifrey right now?

245
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,397
我不知道
I dont know

246
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:50,944
總有一天你會計數你殺死了多少孩子
One day you will count them

247
00:17:52,987 --> 00:17:54,280
在一個可怕的夜晚
One terrible night

248
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:02,038
你想知道你會變成什麼嗎
Do you want to see
what that will turn you into?

249
00:18:03,998 --> 00:18:06,251
別裝了! 難道你不好奇嗎
Come on! Arent you curious?

250
00:18:09,504 --> 00:18:12,549
我可以為你開啟通向你的未來的窗口
Im opening windows on your future

251
00:18:15,218 --> 00:18:17,710
穿過紛亂糾纏的未來
A tangle in time through the days to come

252
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,765
找到今日過後你將成為的人
to the man today will make of you

253
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,814
好吧 沒想到會變這樣子
OK, I wasnt expecting that

254
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,309
但是時間之戰已經結束
But the Time Wars over

255
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:35,561
你幹嘛把我們帶來看一幅畫?
Why have you brought us here to look at a painting?

256
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:38,314
這幅畫只是伊麗莎白的信物
The painting only serves as Elizabeths credentials

257
00:18:38,324 --> 00:18:40,775
來證明那封信是她寫的
proof that the letter is from her

258
00:18:40,785 --> 00:18:42,328
這不是你來這的真正原因
Its not why youre here

259
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:51,118
吾愛 我希望這幅名叫"Gallifrey的隕落"的畫作
My dearest love, I hope the painting known as Gallifrey Falls

260
00:18:51,129 --> 00:18:55,706
可以證明這封信出自你的伊麗莎白之手
will serve as proof that it is your Elizabeth who writes to you now

261
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,917
你將會想起你曾發誓
You will recall that you pledged yourself

262
00:18:57,927 --> 00:18:59,794
捍衛我的王國
to the safety of my kingdom

263
00:18:59,804 --> 00:19:02,463
既然如此 我任命你為這間地下藝術館的館長
In this capacity,I have appointed you as curator

264
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:06,634
這裡封存著對英格蘭的致命威脅
of the Under Gallery where deadly danger to England is locked away

265
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:09,595
如若館內發生任何變故
Should any disturbance occur within its walls

266
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:13,485
我願你能聽到召喚 上帝保佑你,夫君
it is my wish that you be summoned God speed, gentle husband

267
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:18,980
發生了什麼
What happened?

268
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,700
你看看就知道了
Easier to show you

269
00:19:31,961 --> 00:19:33,588
McGillop

270
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,588
不可能啊 我剛剛才
But thats not possible I was just

271
00:19:43,598 --> 00:19:48,853
明白 長官 但是 為什麼我要把它帶到那裡?
Understood, sir But why would I take it there?

272
00:19:59,572 --> 00:20:02,408
伊麗莎白一世? 你認識她?
Elizabeth the First? You knew her, then?

273
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,997
很久之前
A long time ago

274
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,962
Allons-y!
Allons-y!

275
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:30,343
這下你懂了吧 女王陛下 早跟你說了吧
There you go, Your Majesty,what did I tell you?

276
00:20:30,353 --> 00:20:32,178
裡面比外面大!
Bigger on the inside!

277
00:20:32,188 --> 00:20:34,722
門可不是 差點把我的頭削掉
The door isnt - you nearly took my head off

278
00:20:34,732 --> 00:20:36,307
平時都是我削別人的
Its normally me who does that

279
00:20:38,736 --> 00:20:43,606
告訴我,博士 為什麼我要在你身上浪費時間
我還有戰爭要準備
Tell me, Doctor, why Im wasting my time on you I have wars to plan

280

但是你有征戰的野心

284
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,956
這張臉經歷過了戰火
This face has seen conflict

285
00:20:59,966 --> 00:21:01,832
太明顯了
its clear as day

286
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:04,471
你不會相信我所經歷過的戰爭
Oh, Ive seen conflict

287
00:21:05,763 --> 00:21:07,474
不過不是這張臉
But it wasnt this face

288
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:11,759
不說這個了 陛下 快站起來 起來!
But never mind that, Your Majesty -

292
00:21:16,107 --> 00:21:18,015
伊麗莎白
Elizabeth

00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,767
你願意嫁給我嗎

One! The real Elizabeth would never
have accepted my marriage proposal

297
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,403
第二!真正的伊麗莎白會懷疑
Two! The real Elizabeth would notice

298
00:21:30,413 --> 00:21:32,989
當我提及我有不同的面孔
when I just casually mention
having a different face

299
00:21:32,999 --> 00:21:34,949
最後!真正的伊麗莎白
But then the real Elizabeth

300
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:37,785
不是一個來自異星的變形生物!

and download comics from the future

309

I never know when to stop
吾愛 我聽不懂你說的
My love, I do not understand

310
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,108
我可不是你的愛人 而且你明明知道我在說什麼
Im not your love
And yes, you do!

311
00:22:00,151 --> 00:22:01,684
你可是一個Zygon
Youre a Zygon

312
00:22:01,694 --> 00:22:03,019
我是Zygon?
A Zygon?

313
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:05,646
別裝了 我都揭穿你了
對啊 你就是Zygon
Oh, stop it, its over!
A Zygon, yes

314
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,899
一坨紅色佈滿吸盤的橡膠泥
A big red rubbery thing,
covered in suckers

315
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,442
不過吻技不錯
Surprisingly good kisser

316
00:22:09,452 --> 00:22:11,485
你以為真正的英格蘭女王會決定
Think the real Queen of England

317
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,155

handsome bloke in a tight suit

318
00:22:14,165 --> 00:22:16,073
就因為他有完美的頭髮

- 你到底在說什麼?
- formerly disguised as my horse

I am the oncoming storm,
the bringer of darkness,

342
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,163
而你...就是一隻小兔子對吧?

那到底是什麼!告訴我!
That thing explain what it is!

348
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,757
它到底想要什麼?
What does it want of us?

349
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:00,511
這也是我疑惑的
Thats what Im trying to find out
應該也就是你們的星球吧
Probably just your planet

350
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,013
博士?

351
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:06,726
快離開她 博士
Step away from her, Doctor
那不是我 是那個怪物
Thats not me, thats the creature

352
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:09,812
這怎麼可能? 她長得跟我一模一樣
How is that possible? Shes me

353
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,564
博士 她跟我一模一樣!

00:24:11,574 --> 00:24:15,651
我本來就是我 別把誇我的當成誇你的
I am, indeed, me A compliment
that cannot be extended to yourself

355
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,069
不可思議!
Extraordinary!

356
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,739
這個怪物跟我一模一樣
The creature has captured
my exact likeness -

357
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,616
不可思議
this is exceptional

358
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,452
不可思議? 女王會認為這是無禮
Exceptional? A Queen
would call it impertinent

359
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,579
女王會感到必須先欣賞
A Queen would feel
compelled to admire

360
00:24:26,589 --> 00:24:27,914
執行任務的能力
the skill of the execution -

361
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,832
再安排任務(死刑)
before arranging one

362
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,417
它不工作了!
Ah! Its not working!

363
00:24:31,427 --> 00:24:33,628
可以想到這種生物很快就能讓自己
One might surmise
the creature would learn quickly

364
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,713
不被輕易的識別出
to protect itself
from any simple means of detection

365
00:24:35,723 --> 00:24:38,799
顯然你更瞭解這種生物
Clearly you understand
the creature better than I

366
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,801
你更有優勢
But then you have the advantage

367
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,638
你們倆 都後退!
Back, both of you, now!

368
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,807
這是一個時間裂縫 現實的撕裂口
Thats a time fissure,
a tear in the fabric of reality

369
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,319
什麼都可能發生!
Anything could happen!

370
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,730
比如
For instance

00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:38,774
閉嘴!倫敦塔可不能被輕易帶去
Silence! The tower is not to be taken lightly

550
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,610
很少人從那裡活著出來
Very few emerge again

551
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,613
-我的上帝 這人真聰明 跟著我 -我們去哪兒
Dear God, that mans cleverCome on! Where are we going?

552
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,709
我的辦公室 別名倫敦塔
My office Otherwise known as the Tower of London

553
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,340
哦 你們 滾進來
JAILER: Oi, you lot, get in there!

554
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,218
奧!
Ow!

555
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,589
TING!

556
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,840
我們三個在同一個牢房
Three of us in one cell -

557
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:05,843
如果我們不趕快走人的話一定會出現些奇怪的異常
thats going to cause some nasty anomalies if we dont get out soon

558
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:08,231
你在幹什麼
What are you doing?

559
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:14,227
帶我們出去!音速起子對那個不起作用 太原始了
Getting us out! The sonic wont work on that - its too primitive

560
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,896
我們該要求換一個更結實的門好讓我們溜走嗎
Shall we ask for a better quality of door so we can escape(?)

561
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:20,983
好 如今英格蘭的女王是個Zygon
OK, so the Queen of England is now a Zygon,

562
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:23,986
不過先別管這 為什麼我們會在一起
but never mind that, why are we all together?

563
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:25,748
為什麼我們都在這裡
Why are we all here?

564
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:30,159
額 我和尖下巴小子 我們很驚訝
Well, me and Chinny, we were surprised

565
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,827
但是是你來找我們
But you came looking for us -

566
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,746
你知道這一切都會發生 誰告訴你的
you knew it was going to happenWho told you?

567
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:36,207
喂! "尖下巴小子"?
Oi! "Chinny"?

568
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,219
是啊 你下巴是挺明顯的
Yeah, you do have a chin

569
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:45,132
大理石 花崗岩 各種不同的石頭
Marble, granitea lot of different stone,

570
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,386
但無一來自建築本身
but none of it from the fabric of the building

571
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:51,514
看上去似乎有人打爛了好多老雕像
Its like somebody smashed up a lot of old statues

572
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:54,016
有丟失的雕像嗎
Are there any missing?

573
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:55,601
不這麼認為
Dont think so

574
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,614
為什麼會有人這麼做
Why would anyone do that anyway?

575
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:01,607
我的意思是 我們是得保持開放的思維
I mean, I know were meant to keep an open mind,

576
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:04,068
但我們非要相信存在
but are we supposed to believe in creatures

577
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,862
能藏進油畫裡的
that can hide in oil paintings

578
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:08,958
並且對雕像有種奇怪的怨念的怪物麼?
and have some sort of a grudge against statues?

579
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,544
你還好麼?
You all right?

580
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:15,788
-我們得走了 就現在 這一分鐘內 -怎麼回事?
We have to go - right now,this minute Whats wrong?

581
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:18,207
來自畫裡的東西
The things from the paintings

582
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:20,470
我知道它們為什麼要打破雕像
I know why they smashed the statues

583
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:24,474
-為什麼 -因為它們得找個地方藏起來
Why? Because they needed somewhere to hide

584
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:32,763
GURGLING

585
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:34,400
SHE SCREAMS

586
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,703
哦!
Oh!

587
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:53,378
ALARM

588
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:03,044
博士會救我 博士會救我
The Doctor will save me,the Doctor will save me,

589
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,796
博士會救我 博士會救我

590
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:08,883
博士會救我 博士會救我
the Doctor will save me,the Doctor will save me

591
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,479
對不起啊 我得要我的哮喘伴侶
Excuse me -Im going to need my inhaler

592
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,765
我真不喜歡攤上個有毛病的!
I so hate it when I get one with a defect!

593
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:19,393
哦 你在這裡有些很恐怖的回憶嘛
Oh, youve got some perfectly horrible memories in here,

594
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:20,530
不是麼
havent you?

595
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,690
嫉妒你那漂亮的姐姐
So jealous of your pretty sister

596
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:27,954
我可不會責怪你 我希望我複製的是她
I dont blame you,I wish Id copied HER

597
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,124
我也是
So do I!

598
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,377
哦 看在上帝份上
Oh, for goodness sake!

599
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,122
博士將會嘗試給我們發送一則消息
KATE: The Doctor will be trying to send us a message

600
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:41,916
我們在尋找一系列數碼
Were looking for a string of numerals

601
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:46,254
來自1550年 差不多那時候 第一優先
from around 1550, approximately -priority one

602
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,225
我需要訪問黑色檔案庫
Im going to need access to the Black Archive

603
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:53,636
黑色檔案庫
The Black Archive

604
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:56,097
這個星球上防衛等級最高的地方
Highest security rating on the planet

605
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,433
在每次輪班完每個工作人員都將被抹除記憶
The entire staff have their memories wiped at the end of every shift

606
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,352
房頂上有自動的記憶過濾器
Automated memory filters in the ceiling

607
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,782
鑰匙 夫人
Access, please Maam

608
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,486
是不是叫Aktins
Atkins, isnt it?

609
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:12,572
是的夫人 第一天在這裡上班
Yes, maam First day here

（悄悄話）在這裡差不多十年了
(Been here ten years)

611
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:23,916
鎖和鑰匙 挺原始的 不是麼
Lock and key - bit basic, isnt it?

612
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,085
這裡可不允許電子守衛系統
Cant afford electronic security down here -

613
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,461
在這裡得防備博士進來
got to keep the Doctor out

614
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:30,172
整座塔都是防TARDIS的
The whole of the Tower is TARDIS-proofed

615
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:33,259
-他可不會允許有這樣的收藏品 -但你卻讓我進來了
He really wouldnt approve of the collection But you let me in?

616
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:36,429
上次來過之後你擁有了我們這最高級的防衛等級
You have a top-level security rating from your last visit

617
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,431
抱歉 我的什麼
Sorry, my what?

618
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,309
抱歉 我們得監視已知的他的所有聯繫人
Apologies We have to screen all of his known associates -

619
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,228
我們可不能讓博士和TARDIS的情報
we cant have information about the Doctor and the TARDIS

620
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,980
落在壞人手裡
falling into the wrong hands

621
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,868
不然結果會是災難性的
The consequences could be disastrous

622
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:52,956
那是啥
What is that?

623
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,489
時間旅行
Time travel

624
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,659
時間渦流控制器 遵照Jack Harkness上校的遺囑
A vortex manipulator,bequeathed to the UNIT archive

625
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,495
在他死後贈與UNIT檔案館
by Captain Jack Harkness,on the occasion of his death

626
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,331
好吧 在他某一次死後
Well, one of them

627
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:07,126
-不可以有人知道我們擁有這些 即便是我們的同盟 -為什麼
No-one can know we have this, not even our allies Why not?

628
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:11,923
好好想想 美國人擁有重寫歷史的能力?
Think about it! Americans with the ability to rewrite history?

629
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,685
你也不是沒看過他們的電影
Youve seen their movies

630
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:21,432
好 這就是我們該如何解救博士
OK, so this is how were going to rescue the Doctor

631
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:25,937
我不知道是不是有足夠的能量進行往返旅行
Im not sure theres enough power for a two-way trip

632
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:28,439
無論如何 我們都不知道啟動密碼
In any event,we dont know the activation code

633
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:29,857
博士知道我們擁有這個
The Doctor knows we have this,

634
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,734
所以他老是把密碼藏著
so hes always kept the code from us

635
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:34,445
希望他改變想法了
PHONE RINGS Lets hope he changes his mind

636
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:36,489
是的
Yes

637
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,282
恩 既然你發現它了
Well, if youve found it,

638
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:41,671
把它拍下來並發到我的手機上
photograph it and send it to my phone

639
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:50,378
額 Kate 他們該在這裡嗎
Erm, Kate Should they be here?

640
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,921
他們為什麼要跟蹤我們
Why have they followed us?

641
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:56,217
哦 他們一定是提早把那些人類搞定了
Oh, theyve probably just finished disposing of the humans a bit early

642
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,469
人類?
The humans?

643
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,485
我的天啊 我入戲太深了 不是麼
Dear me! I really do get into character, dont I?

644
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,619
地下藝術館已被封閉
The Under Gallery is secured

645
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:29,636
準備再處理多一個人類 我們得到那設備了
Prepare to dispose of one more human We have acquired the device

646
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,515
啟動密碼 對嗎
Activation code - right?

647
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:41,888
理論上 我可以啟動單獨的音波
In theory, I can trigger an isolated sonic shift

648
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:45,349
在分子間移動這樣門就會被分體
among the molecules,and the door should disintegrate

649
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,727
我們得從亞原子水平上計算出
Wed have to calculate the exact harmonic resonance

650
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:50,021
整個結構的准群諧振頻率
of the entire structure down to a sub-atomic level

651
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:51,439
即便是音速起子也得耗上好幾年
Even the sonic would take years

652
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,901
不 不 音速起子得耗上好幾個世紀
No, no The sonic would take centuries

653
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:56,986
哦 那我們還是馬上開始的好
Oh, we might at all get started

654
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,165
麻煩告訴我那什麼"時間糾結"
Help to pass the "timey-wimey"

655
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:02,408
你非得像個小孩那樣說話嗎
Do you have to talk like children?

656
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:05,505
是什麼令你對成為大人那麼羞恥
What is it that makes you so ashamed of being a grown-up?

657
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:13,002
哦 你倆看我的方式 發生什麼了
Oh, the way you both look at me What is that?

658
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,724
我在嘗試找一個比"恐懼"更好的形容詞
Im trying to think of a better word than "dread"

659
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:20,259
那對於你來說一定才發生不久
It must be really recent for you

660
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,355
不久?
Recent?

661
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:26,766
時間大戰 最後那天 你殺了所有人的那天
The Time War, the last day The day you killed them all

662
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:29,612
-我們殺了所有人的那天 -一回事
The day WE killed them all Same thing

663
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,275
對於他們來說只是一段歷史 一切已被決定
Its history for them All decided

664
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:38,611
他們以為他們的未來是真實的 他們不知道
They think their future is real -they dont know

665
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,696
一切取決於你
its still up to you

666
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:42,281
我不跟人並不談論這事
I dont talk about it

667
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:46,536
你沒在跟人談論它 這裡沒別人 繼續 問他們
Youre not talking about it Theres no-one else here Go on Ask them

668
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:48,673
問他們你要知道的答案
Ask them what you need to know

669
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,876
你數過嗎?
Did you ever count?

670
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:55,263
數什麼?
Count what?

671
00:41:56,306 --> 00:41:59,309
那天 Gallifrey上有多少個孩子
How many children there were on Gallifrey that day

672
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:06,180
我完全沒有概念
I have absolutely no idea

673
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:08,391
你現在多少歲了
How old are you now?

674
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:12,353
額 我不知道 我迷失方向了
AhI dont know, I lose track

675
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,982
我想我1200歲 除非我在撒謊
Twelve hundred and something,I think, unless Im lying

676
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:18,860
我不記得我是不是在對年齡撒謊 這就是我有多老
I cant remember if Im lying about my age - thats how old I am

677
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,695
比我老400歲
400 years older than me

678
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:24,365
在這麼長一段時間 你竟然沒有好奇過到底有多少個人?
And in all that time, youve never even wondered how many there were?

679
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,878
你竟然從沒數過?
You never once counted?

680
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:31,038
告訴我
Tell me

681
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,415
這有什麼意義
what would be the point?

682
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:35,293
24.7億
247 billion

683
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:36,721
你的確數過！
You DID count!

684
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:40,798
你忘記了
You forgot?

685
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:43,009
400年 400年你就都忘了?
400 years? Is that all it takes?

686
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:45,011
我繼續前進了
I moved on

687
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:48,556
向哪裡前進?! 如果你能忘記這種事 你現在在哪裡?
Where?! Where can you be now that you can forget something like that?

688
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,308
劇透 不
Spoilers No

689
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:52,977
不不不 就這一次 我希望知道我要往何處去
No, no, no For once, I would like to know where Im going

690
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,405
不 你絕對不會想知道
No You really wouldnt

691
00:42:57,742 --> 00:43:01,527
我不知道你們是誰 你們倆
I dont know who you are either of you

692
00:43:01,538 --> 00:43:03,696
我完全沒概念
I havent got the faintest idea

693
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,208
他們就是你
Theyre you

694
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:08,878
如果你毀滅Gallifrey的話 他們就是你要變成的人
Theyre what you become if you destroy Gallifrey

695
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,507
一直後悔的人
The man who regrets

696
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:15,833
與忘記一切的人
and the man who forgets

697
00:43:15,844 --> 00:43:18,377
時間之匣就要開啟
The moment is coming

698
00:43:18,388 --> 00:43:21,516
而時間之匣就是我 你需要做出決定
The Moment is me,you have to decide

699
00:43:29,566 --> 00:43:30,723
不
No

700
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,068
不
No?

701
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,645
就是不
Just no!

702
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:37,563
HE LAUGHS

703
00:43:37,574 --> 00:43:41,275
有什麼好笑的 我錯過了什麼有趣的事
Is something funny?Did I miss a funny thing?

704
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:43,444
對不起 只是我突然想起
Sorry It just occurred to me

705
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:45,540
我獨處的時候就是這樣
This is what Im like when Im alone

706
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:49,085
它們是同一把起子
Its the same screwdriver

707
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:58,678
同樣的軟件 不一樣的外殼
Same software different case

708
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,679
400年!
400 years!

709
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:10,930
抱歉
Im sorry?

710
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:14,308
在軟件層面上它們是一樣的 不是嗎
At a software level, theyre all the same device, arent they?

711
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,853
同樣的軟件 不同的外殼
Same software, different case

712
00:44:16,863 --> 00:44:19,021
恩 所以
Yeah So?

713
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:24,068
所以 對於音速起子來說 它需要幾個世紀去計算
So, it would take centuries for the screwdriver to calculate

714
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:27,989
如何令這扇門解體 掃瞄這門
how to disintegrate the door Scanning the door,

715
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:31,492
把計算過程作為子程序
implanting the calculation as a permanent subroutine

716
00:44:31,503 --> 00:44:33,953
永久植入軟件結構
in the software architecture

717
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:37,373
即使你們真的是我的話
and if you really are me,

718
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:41,085
就憑那沙灘鞋和奇怪的領結
with your sandshoes and your dicky bow,

719
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:43,807
音速起子也還是屬於我的
and that screwdriver is still mine

720
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:47,227
那麼計算過程應該還在繼續
that calculation is still going on

721
00:44:51,648 --> 00:44:54,098
恩 還在進行
Yeah Still going

722
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:55,349
計算已完成
Calculation complete

723
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,227
同樣的軟件 不同的外殼
Same software Different face

724
00:44:58,238 --> 00:45:01,898
額 400年濃縮在4秒鐘 我們或許有分歧
Eh, 400 years in four seconds We may have our differences,

725
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:03,816
在這情況下確實有點囧
which is frankly odd in the circumstances,

726
00:45:03,827 --> 00:45:08,289
但我得告訴你們 娃娃們 我們太聰明了!
but I tell you what, boys, we are incredibly clever!

727
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,203
你是怎麼做到的
How did you that?

728
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:17,997
它都沒鎖 好不
It wasnt locked Right

729
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:20,541
所以他們都是你 對吧
So theyre both you, then, yeah?

730
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:23,211
對 你之前都見過他們了 還記得嗎
Yes Youve met them before,dont you remember?

731
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:25,421
一點啦 不錯的西裝
A bit Nice suit!

732
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:26,797
多謝
Thanks

733
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:28,382
等等
Hang on

734
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:31,510
三個你們在同一個牢房 但你們沒有一個想過嘗試一下開門
Three of you in one cell, and none of you thought to try the door

735
00:45:31,521 --> 00:45:32,803
它本應鎖起來的啊
It should have been locked

736
00:45:32,814 --> 00:45:34,722
對 沒錯 為什麼它沒被鎖起來
Yes, exactly! Why wasnt it locked?

737
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:38,351
因為我很想看看為了逃走你們會做些什麼
Because I was fascinated to see what you would do upon escaping

738
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:41,020
我知道你還比較喜歡這個世界
I understand youre rather fond of this world

739
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:44,451
是時候讓你看看會發生些什麼了
Its time I think you saw whats going to happen to it

740
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:19,100
Kate 哦天啊 你還沒死
Kate? Oh, goodness,youre not actually dead

741
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,987
哦 這還真是個大新聞
Oh, thats tremendous news!

742
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:25,940
那些怪物 他們把自己複製成我們
Those creatures,they turn themselves into copies

743
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,943
他們需要讓原型存活下來 更新他們的形象
And they need to keep the original alive, refresh the image,

744
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:30,194
可以這麼說
so to speak

745
00:46:30,205 --> 00:46:32,029
他們去哪了
Wherewhere did they go?

746
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,992
我不知道 哦 等等 恩 我知道了 倫敦塔
I dont know Ooh, hang on -yes, I do The Tower

747
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:39,453
如果那些怪物進去了黑色檔案庫的話
If those creatures have got access to the Black Archive,

748
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:41,841
我們或許就要失去對這個星球的控制了
we may just have lost control of the planet

749
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:47,169
Zygon失去了他們的世界
The Zygons lost their own world

750
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:50,798
他們的母星在時間之戰的最初幾天消亡於烈火之中
It burned in the first days of the Time War

751
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:52,185
他們需要一個新的家園
A new home is required

752
00:46:54,521 --> 00:46:56,429
所以他們想佔用這個
So they want this one?

753
00:46:56,439 --> 00:46:59,140
還沒 太過原始了
Not yet Far too primitive

754
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:02,101
Zygon已經習慣了一定的舒適程度
Zygons are used to a certain level of comfort

755
00:47:02,112 --> 00:47:04,364
指令官
Commander

756
00:47:05,782 --> 00:47:09,025
為什麼這些怪物會在這裡
why are these creatures here?

757
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:10,735
因為我讓他們在這裡
Because I say they should be

758
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:13,498
是時候你倆也被傳送進去了
It is time you too were translated

759
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:17,783
觀察這一切
Observe this

760
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:20,912
我想你會覺得這很神奇
I believe you will find it fascinating

761
00:47:30,557 --> 00:47:33,716
就是他 那就是在畫裡的Zygron
Thats him! Thats the Zygon in the picture now

762
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:36,135
那不是副畫 那是個停滯立方體
THE OTHER DOCTOR: Its not a picture,its a Stasis Cube

763
00:47:36,146 --> 00:47:38,012
時間領主的藝術
Time Lord art -

764
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:41,891
時間上的固定瞬間 裡面比外面大
frozen instants in time,bigger on the inside

765
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:44,352
但也能被部署為
but could be deployed as

766
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:48,064
延遲動畫 哦 這還真棒
Suspended animation Oh, thats very good

767
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:51,192
Zygon全都跑進了畫裡 等上幾個世紀
The Zygons all pop inside the pictures, wait a few centuries

768
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:54,153
直到這星球變得有趣了那麼一點 他們便從裡面出來
till the planets a bit more interesting, and then out they come

769
00:47:54,164 --> 00:47:55,321
Clara 你明白嗎
You see, Clara,

770
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:58,741
它們就藏在地下藝術館的畫裡面 就像速食湯那樣
theyre stored in the paintings inthe Under Gallery, like Cup-a-Soups

771
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:01,202
只不過你要加的是時間（而不是水） 如果你能想像那畫面的話
Except you add time -if you can picture that

772
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:04,247
沒人能想像那畫面好麼 忘掉速食湯的事吧
Nobody could picture that Forget I said Cup-a-Soups

773
00:48:04,257 --> 00:48:06,499
如今這世界變得值得征服了
And now the world is worth conquering

774
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:08,668
所以Zygons是從過去
So the Zygons are invading the future

775
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:10,044
入侵未來
from the past

776
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:11,890
沒錯!
Exactly!

777
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:17,009
知道為什麼我知道你是個贗品嗎?
And do you know why I know that youre a fake?

778
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:19,720
因為你這贗品也太差了
Because you're such a bad copy.

779
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:22,557
不光是你的氣味 或者這缺乏說服力的頭髮
It's not just the smell,or the unconvincing hair,

780
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:26,352
或者這一口爛牙，或者你的眼睛 它們靠的太近了
or the atrocious teeth, or the eyes just a bit too close together,

781
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:29,021
還有口臭 能熏倒一匹馬
or the breath that could stun a horse

782
00:48:29,032 --> 00:48:31,732
是因為我的伊麗莎白 真正的伊麗莎白
it's because my Elizabeth,the real Elizabeth,

783
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:35,027
絕對不會蠢到自己揭露她的計劃
would never be stupid enough to reveal her own plan.

784
00:48:35,038 --> 00:48:37,321
說真的 你為什麼這麼做?
Honestly, why would you do that?

785
00:48:37,332 --> 00:48:39,949
因為這不是我的計劃
Because it's not my plan,

786
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:42,212
而我是真正的伊麗莎白
and I AM the real Elizabeth.

787
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:46,956
啊好 那 我們往回倒一點
OK. So...backtracking a moment,

788
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:49,750
給我之前的評論加一點上下文
just to lend some context to my earlier remarks...

789
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:51,794
我那雙胞胎在森林裡死了
My twin is dead in the forest.

790
00:48:51,805 --> 00:48:54,297
我習慣於採取警戒措施
I am accustomed to taking precautions.

791
00:48:54,307 --> 00:48:57,049
這些Zygon怪物一點也沒想到是我
These Zygon creatures never even considered that it was me

792
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,594
而不是他們的指揮官 活了下來
who survived,rather than their own commander.

793
00:48:59,604 --> 00:49:02,263
狂妄是他們種族的特點
The arrogance that typifies their kind.

794
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:03,431
Zygons?
Zygons?
Zygons?

795
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:06,184
天啊!你真的殺了一個？
Men!
And you actually killed one of them?

796
00:49:06,194 --> 00:49:08,686
我也許擁有一個弱小脆弱女人的身軀
I may have the body of a weak and feeble woman,

797
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:11,606
但那個時候 那個Zygon也是如此

798
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:14,108
我的王國危在旦夕

799
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:16,402
博士 我能信賴你嗎?

800
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:17,904
這樣的話 我就需要我的TARDIS了

801
00:49:17,914 --> 00:49:20,448
已經到手了 哈!

802
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:23,503
但首先 吾愛，你有個承諾要守住！

803
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:30,708
我現在宣佈你們為…丈夫和妻子

804
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:34,180
你可以吻新娘了

805
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:41,844
未來有很多這種事情嗎？

806
00:49:41,855 --> 00:49:44,232
從現在開始 是的

807
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:48,267
上帝保佑 我的愛

808
00:49:48,278 --> 00:49:50,280
我馬上就回來

809
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:57,620
喔!

810
00:50:00,248 --> 00:50:02,667
好的 接下來 回到未來

811
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:07,745
看你把這裡折騰的!

812
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:10,122
啊 這是他的邋遢階段 慢慢會好的

813
00:50:10,133 --> 00:50:12,959
你別聽他們的!

814
00:50:12,969 --> 00:50:16,712
噢! 界面故障了

815
00:50:16,723 --> 00:50:20,049
我們三個來自不同的時間 它在嘗試修理整合

816
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:22,885
嘿 看 這些圓圓的東西

817
00:50:22,896 --> 00:50:26,222
我超愛這些圓圓的東西

818
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:28,182
不知道

819
00:50:28,193 --> 00:50:30,810
哦 天 摩擦相反控制器

820
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,947
哈!這兒呢!穩定下來了

821
00:50:34,783 --> 00:50:36,774
哦 你重新裝修過了！

822
00:50:36,785 --> 00:50:37,859
我不喜歡

823
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:40,319
哦? 噢 對 哦

824
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:44,198
你從來都不! 聽著 我們要去國立美術館 Zyong們就在那下面

825
00:50:44,209 --> 00:50:47,212
不 去UNIT總部 他們尾隨我們到了黑色檔案館

826
00:50:50,173 --> 00:50:53,009
好吧 所以你們聽說過那個

827
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:57,587
這裡的儀器超凡脫俗

828
00:50:57,597 --> 00:51:00,464
有一半的東西人類都不知道是用來幹什麼的

829
00:51:00,475 --> 00:51:03,467
我們可以在一天內就征服他們的世界

830
00:51:03,478 --> 00:51:05,970
在對於複製品的選擇上

831
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:08,347
我們非常幸運

832
00:51:08,358 --> 00:51:11,434
如果我是人類，我會說這就像聖誕節一樣

833
00:51:11,444 --> 00:51:15,730
不 很抱歉你不會的 我們沒有武器 你可以放鬆

834
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:19,400
我們有武器 你沒法放鬆

835
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,277
鎖上門

836
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:23,289
很抱歉我們不可以被打擾到

837
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:26,991
你不介意我坐的舒服點吧?

838
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:30,130
你不介意我也坐的舒服點吧?

839
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:40,713
你會意識到有議定條款保護著這個地方的

840
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:42,798
-Osgood -倘若有外星人入侵的事件發生

841
00:51:42,809 --> 00:51:45,051
因為這屋裡的所有的東西都被視為極端危險

842
00:51:45,061 --> 00:51:47,511
-它會自我銷毀 在 -五分鐘之內

843
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:52,892
20英尺之下有個核彈頭對著我們

844
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:54,435
你坐的還舒服嗎?

845
00:51:54,446 --> 00:51:56,479
你要毀滅倫敦?

846
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:58,356
來保護世界? 是的 我會

847
00:51:58,366 --> 00:51:59,649
你在虛張聲勢

848
00:51:59,659 --> 00:52:00,983
你真的這麼覺得?

849
00:52:00,994 --> 00:52:02,860
你的記憶中會有一個人名叫

850
00:52:02,871 --> 00:52:05,196
Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart.
Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart旅長

851
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:07,490
我是他的女兒

852
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,368
"科學引導" Kate 這是你的本意嗎?
"Science leads," Kate. Is that what you meant?

853
00:52:10,378 --> 00:52:11,994
"這是你父親的本意嗎?"

854
00:52:12,005 --> 00:52:14,580
博士?

855
00:52:14,591 --> 00:52:17,625
一個我送給你父親的禮物 呼叫TARDIS的直通熱線

856
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:21,712
我知道黑色檔案館的事情 我也知道安保條款的事情

857
00:52:21,723 --> 00:52:23,089
Kate 拜託

858
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:26,801
請不要告訴我你要做些超級愚蠢的事情

859
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:28,719
-很抱歉 博士 -關掉它

860
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:30,846
你以後會更抱歉
Not as sorry as you will be.

861
00:52:30,857 --> 00:52:33,818
這不是你能夠背負一生的決定

862
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:43,025
Kate! 我們要把TARDIS開過來 為什麼我們不能著陸

863
00:52:43,036 --> 00:52:44,235
我說了 關掉它!

864
00:52:44,245 --> 00:52:46,623
不 Kate 拜託，聽我說...

865
00:52:52,253 --> 00:52:54,537
倫敦塔 完全防TARDIS

866
00:52:54,547 --> 00:52:55,872
他們怎麼做到的?

867
00:52:55,882 --> 00:52:58,124
外星科技加上人類的愚蠢

868
00:52:58,134 --> 00:52:59,542
相信我 它是無法戰勝的

869
00:52:59,552 --> 00:53:01,095
我們不需要著陸

870
00:53:03,056 --> 00:53:05,756
不 我們需要 有一點點需要 試著跟上節奏

871
00:53:05,767 --> 00:53:10,730
不 我們不需要 我們不需要 還有別的辦法
No, we don't. We don't.There is another way.

872
00:53:13,108 --> 00:53:14,734
速食湯!

873
00:53:19,197 --> 00:53:21,241
什麼速食湯!

874
00:53:23,076 --> 00:53:24,525
發生什麼了?

875
00:53:24,536 --> 00:53:26,204
展示給你看更方便點

876
00:53:34,504 --> 00:53:36,078
McGillop.

877
00:53:36,089 --> 00:53:38,716
看看你的手機 確定下你在和誰講話

878
00:53:42,053 --> 00:53:44,295
但這不可能 我剛剛才

879
00:53:44,305 --> 00:53:46,297
你剛剛在和我說話 我知道

880
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:47,965
我是個時間旅行者 自己琢磨去吧

881
00:53:47,976 --> 00:53:51,010
我需要你把Gallifrey的隕落這幅畫送到黑色檔案館

882
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:52,929
明白?

883
00:53:52,939 --> 00:53:56,140
但我為什麼要帶過去?

884
00:53:56,151 --> 00:53:59,101
你的一句話就可以取消倒計時

885
00:53:59,112 --> 00:54:00,186
確實

886
00:54:00,196 --> 00:54:01,771
它根據你的聲紋定調

887
00:54:01,781 --> 00:54:02,855
只有我的

888
00:54:02,866 --> 00:54:05,358
不再是這樣了 取消爆炸!

889
00:54:05,368 --> 00:54:07,360
撤回命令!

890
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:08,653
撤回命令!

891
00:54:08,663 --> 00:54:11,155
我們只有同意才能生存

892
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:13,366
很不幸 我們只能同意死亡

893
00:54:13,376 --> 00:54:16,577
求你 博士 請救救我們

894
00:54:16,588 --> 00:54:18,913
請救救我們 請救救我們

895
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:20,925
請救救我們

896
00:54:33,062 --> 00:54:35,398
消滅!

897
00:55:03,843 --> 00:55:05,084
你好

898
00:55:05,094 --> 00:55:06,210
我是博士

899
00:55:06,221 --> 00:55:07,639
抱歉Dalek來搗亂了

900
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:10,965
還有這些臭顯擺

901
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:16,012
Kate Lethbridge-Stewart 你都幹了些什麼好事?

902
00:55:16,022 --> 00:55:18,639
只有我親自下令倒計時才能停止

903
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:20,391
你什麼也做不了

904
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:21,934
除非讓你們兩個都同意停止

905
00:55:21,945 --> 00:55:23,311
你們三個也阻止不了我

906
00:55:23,321 --> 00:55:25,605
你會殺掉幾百萬人的

907
00:55:25,615 --> 00:55:29,901
拯救了幾十億 這樣的計算你做過幾次?

908
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:31,444
一次

909
00:55:31,454 --> 00:55:32,997
把我變成了現在這樣的人

910
00:55:34,541 --> 00:55:36,324
我甚至都不再確定這個人是誰

911
00:55:36,334 --> 00:55:39,035
你告訴自己這是正義的 但它是個謊言

912
00:55:39,045 --> 00:55:42,788
因為我那天做的事情是錯誤的 完全錯誤

913
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:45,291
正是因為我當時做錯了

914
00:55:45,301 --> 00:55:48,721
我現在要讓你…做對它

915
00:55:50,974 --> 00:55:52,924
怎麼做?

916
00:55:52,934 --> 00:55:55,676
接下來的任何一秒 你要停止那個倒計時

917
00:55:55,687 --> 00:55:56,886
你們兩個 一起

918
00:55:56,896 --> 00:55:59,597
然後你去談判出一個最完美的協議

919
00:55:59,607 --> 00:56:01,557
防護措施全面啟動 對雙方都公平

920
00:56:01,568 --> 00:56:03,267
完美談判的訣竅就是

921
00:56:03,278 --> 00:56:05,811
不知道自己的立場是哪一方

922
00:56:05,822 --> 00:56:08,272
那麼 直到我們決定放你走

923
00:56:08,283 --> 00:56:09,815
接下來的幾個小時裡

924
00:56:09,826 --> 00:56:12,610
這房間裡將沒有一個人能記得自己到底是人類

925
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:13,694
還是Zygon
..
Or Zygon.

926
00:56:13,705 --> 00:56:15,540
哎呦呦個菊花開燦爛的開!

927
00:56:26,426 --> 00:56:29,179
取消爆炸!

928
00:56:30,513 --> 00:56:32,432
我們的和平年代

929
00:56:43,193 --> 00:56:44,433
很好玩 對吧?

930
00:56:44,444 --> 00:56:47,103
如果我是個Zygon 那我的衣服也一定是Zygon

931
00:56:47,113 --> 00:56:49,981
那麼 如果我丟了一隻鞋或者別的什麼的怎麼辦?

932
00:56:51,284 --> 00:56:52,535
哦!
Oh!

933
00:57:22,107 --> 00:57:24,515
你好

934
00:57:24,526 --> 00:57:27,310
你好 我叫Clara

935
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,187
我們還沒見過面

936
00:57:29,197 --> 00:57:31,449
我期待著

937
00:57:34,994 --> 00:57:36,485
有問題嗎?

938
00:57:36,496 --> 00:57:39,071
博士 我的那個

939
00:57:39,082 --> 00:57:41,574
我的那個博士

940
00:57:41,584 --> 00:57:44,785
他常常說起那天

941
00:57:44,796 --> 00:57:48,164
他毀滅時間領主來終止戰爭的那天

942
00:57:48,174 --> 00:57:49,999
有人會

943
00:57:50,009 --> 00:57:51,427
你不會

944
00:57:53,471 --> 00:57:56,641
因為你還沒去做 這件事仍然在你的未來

945
00:57:58,852 --> 00:58:00,927
你對自己很肯定

946
00:58:00,937 --> 00:58:05,139
他很後悔 我每天都能從他的眼睛裡讀到愧疚

947
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:06,724
他願意做任何事情來改變

948
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:09,737
包括拯救這些所有人

949
00:58:11,948 --> 00:58:15,149
你覺得他的愧疚拯救了多少個世界？

950
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:21,249
放眼看看 - 人類和Zygon們和平的相處在一起

951
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:24,586
你怎麼知道?

952
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:27,005
你的眼睛

953
00:58:28,465 --> 00:58:30,383
你年輕很多

954
00:58:33,011 --> 00:58:34,971
深思熟慮之下

955
00:58:36,848 --> 00:58:39,017
我是該成長起來了
..
it's time I grew up.

956
00:58:42,645 --> 00:58:44,314
我需要見識的都見過了

957
00:58:46,524 --> 00:58:48,359
這一刻已經到來

958
00:58:53,531 --> 00:58:54,689
我準備好了

959
00:58:54,699 --> 00:58:56,201
我知道你準備好了

960
00:58:58,787 --> 00:59:02,415
誰在那?

961
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:19,046
你想要一個大紅按鈕

962
00:59:19,057 --> 00:59:23,384
一聲巨響  再也沒有時間領主

963
00:59:23,394 --> 00:59:25,678
再也沒有Dalek

964
00:59:25,688 --> 00:59:27,148
你確定嗎?

965
00:59:28,942 --> 00:59:30,777
我當時來這的時候非常確定

966
00:59:32,237 --> 00:59:34,061
沒有別的方法

967
00:59:34,072 --> 00:59:36,230
你見過了你將會成為的人

968
00:59:36,241 --> 00:59:38,191
那些人

969
00:59:38,201 --> 00:59:39,828
非同尋常

970
00:59:41,162 --> 00:59:42,737
他們曾經是你

971
00:59:42,747 --> 00:59:44,165
不
No.

972
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:47,867
他們是博士
They were the Doctor.

973
00:59:47,877 --> 00:59:49,160
而你也是博士
You're the Doctor too.

974
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:50,672
不
No.

975
00:59:52,257 --> 00:59:54,843
偉大的人鍛造於烈火之中
Great men are forged in fire.

976
00:59:56,386 --> 00:59:59,722
點燃這個火焰是小人物的榮幸...
It is the privilege of lesser men to light the flame...

977
01:00:04,686 --> 01:00:07,053
無論代價是什麼..
..whatever the cost.

978
01:00:07,063 --> 01:00:09,941
（孩子的笑聲）
CHILDREN LAUGH

979
01:00:15,196 --> 01:00:17,063
你知道TARDIS發出的聲音吧？
You know the sound the TARDIS makes?

980
01:00:17,073 --> 01:00:20,243
那個呼哧作響的...低哼聲
That wheezing...groaning.

981
01:00:22,078 --> 01:00:25,540
那個聲音給所到之處都帶去了希望
That sound brings hope wherever it goes.

982
01:00:26,583 --> 01:00:30,243
是的 是的 我希望它帶到了
Yes. Yes, I like to think it does.

983
01:00:30,253 --> 01:00:33,465
給每一個聽到它的人 博士
To anyone who hears it, Doctor.

984
01:00:34,507 --> 01:00:37,510
任何人 無論多麼的迷失...
Anyone, however lost...

985
01:00:40,722 --> 01:00:42,432
..甚至是你!
..even you!

986
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:07,207
我告訴過你 他還沒有做過
I told you - he hasn't done it yet.

987
01:01:08,249 --> 01:01:10,575
你們全都給我走開
Go away now, all of you.

988
01:01:10,585 --> 01:01:12,003
這是我的事情
This is for me.

989
01:01:14,422 --> 01:01:17,540
這些事情應該被時間鎖住 我們根本不應該在這裡
These events should be time locked - we shouldn't even be here.

990
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:19,250
所以有什麼東西讓我們穿過來了
So something let us through.

991
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:21,919
你們幾個聰明的男孩！
You clever boys!

992
01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:24,171
回去
Go back.

993
01:01:24,182 --> 01:01:25,725
回去你們自己的生活
Go back to your lives.

994
01:01:27,268 --> 01:01:31,262
去成為那個我無法成為的博士
Go and be the Doctor that I could never be.

995
01:01:31,272 --> 01:01:34,234
讓這變得有意義
Make it worthwhile.

996
01:01:37,612 --> 01:01:40,532
這麼多年 把你埋藏在我的記憶裡
All those years, burying you in my memory.

997
01:01:42,283 --> 01:01:44,775
假裝你不存在
Pretending you didn't exist.

998
01:01:44,786 --> 01:01:47,497
把你當做秘密 甚至對我自己也是
Keeping you a secret, even from myself.

999
01:01:49,749 --> 01:01:51,574
裝作你不是博士
Pretending you weren't the Doctor,

1000
01:01:51,584 --> 01:01:54,076
儘管你比任何人都適合博士這個身份
when you were the Doctor more than anybody else.

1001
01:01:54,087 --> 01:01:58,800
在事情本不可能做對的那天 你是博士
You were the Doctor on the day it wasn't possible to get it right.

1002
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:04,848
但這一次...
But this time...

1003
01:02:06,975 --> 01:02:09,394
..你不需要獨自面對
..You don't have to do it alone.

1004
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:15,942
謝謝你
Thank you.

1005
01:02:18,611 --> 01:02:22,782
我們今天所做的事不是出自恐懼或怨恨
What we do today is not out of fear or hatred.

1006
01:02:24,117 --> 01:02:26,911
我們這樣做是因為別無它法
It is done because there is no other way.

1007
01:02:28,413 --> 01:02:33,293
我們這樣做是為了我們沒能拯救的那些生命
And it is done in the name of the many lives we are failing to save.

1008
01:02:45,638 --> 01:02:46,723
怎麼了?
What?

1009
01:02:48,099 --> 01:02:49,340
喂 到底怎麼了?
What is it, what?

1010
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:51,644
沒什麼… 沒事
Nothing... No.

1011
01:02:52,979 --> 01:02:54,637
是什麼 告訴我！
It's something. Tell me!

1012
01:02:54,647 --> 01:02:58,401
你告訴我你毀滅了你的種族 我只是...
You told me you wiped out your own people. I just...

1013
01:03:00,904 --> 01:03:04,355
我無法想像你做了這種事 僅此而已
I never pictured you doing it, that's all.

1014
01:03:04,365 --> 01:03:05,867
仔細看清楚
Take a closer look.

1015
01:03:12,415 --> 01:03:13,739
發生什麼事情了?
CLARA: What's happening?

1016
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:16,461
沒事  這是個投影
Nothing - it's a projection.

1017
01:03:18,129 --> 01:03:20,381
圍繞你的是一個現實
ROSE: It's a reality around you.

1018
01:03:34,062 --> 01:03:36,815
這就是你要燒死的人?
These are the people you're going to burn?

1019
01:03:41,402 --> 01:03:43,811
沒有什麼我們可以做的了
There isn't anything we can do.

1020
01:03:43,822 --> 01:03:45,104
他說的對
He's right.

1021
01:03:45,115 --> 01:03:47,190
沒有別的方法 從來都沒有
There isn't another way, there never was.

1022
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:51,611
要麼我就毀滅掉自己的種族 要麼我就讓整個宇宙灰飛煙滅
Either I destroy my own people or let the universe burn.

1023
01:03:51,621 --> 01:03:53,248
看看你們...
Look at you...

1024
01:03:54,499 --> 01:03:56,741
..你們三個
..the three of you.

1025
01:03:56,751 --> 01:03:58,868
戰士 英雄
The warrior. The hero.

1026
01:03:58,878 --> 01:04:01,381
還有你
And you.

1027
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:08,002
我是什麼？
And what am I?

1028
01:04:08,012 --> 01:04:09,587
你真的忘記了嗎?
Have you really forgotten?

1029
01:04:09,597 --> 01:04:12,632
是的 也許是的
Yes. Maybe, yes.

1030
01:04:12,642 --> 01:04:15,968
我們已經有了足夠多的戰士
We've got enough warriors -

1031
01:04:15,979 --> 01:04:17,689
隨便一個老糊塗都可以當英雄
any old idiot can be hero.

1032
01:04:22,026 --> 01:04:24,070
那我能做什麼？
Then what do I do?

1033
01:04:27,657 --> 01:04:29,409
做你常做的
What you've always done.

1034
01:04:33,872 --> 01:04:35,165
做個博士!
Be a doctor!

1035
01:04:44,716 --> 01:04:47,208
你告訴過我你選擇的這個名字是一個承諾
You told me the name you chose was a promise.

1036
01:04:47,218 --> 01:04:48,511
那承諾是什麼？
What was the promise?

1037
01:04:50,346 --> 01:04:52,640
永不摧殘他人 也不怯懦怕事
Never cruel or cowardly.

1038
01:04:55,435 --> 01:04:57,134
永不放棄
Never give up,

1039
01:04:57,145 --> 01:04:58,855
永不屈服
never give in.

1040
01:05:21,836 --> 01:05:26,205
你不是真的建議我們改變我們自己的歷史吧?
You're not actually suggesting that we change our own personal history?

1041
01:05:26,216 --> 01:05:28,457
我們一直在改變歷史
We change history all the time.

1042
01:05:28,468 --> 01:05:30,751
我在建議一些更糟糕的事情
I'm suggesting something far worse.

1043
01:05:30,762 --> 01:05:32,388
到底是什麼？
What, exactly?

1044
01:05:35,475 --> 01:05:41,356
先生們 我用了400年的時間來思考這個
Gentleman, I have had 400 years to think about this.

1045
01:05:42,857 --> 01:05:45,151
我改變主意了
I've changed my mind.

1046
01:05:50,156 --> 01:05:54,233
那裡還是會有數以百計的Dalek進行著攻擊
There's still a billion billion Daleks up there, attacking.

1047
01:05:54,244 --> 01:05:56,027
是的 會有 會有
Yeah, there is, there is.

1048
01:05:56,037 --> 01:05:59,530
但有些事情是那數以百計的Dalek不知道的
But there's something those billion billion Daleks don't know.

1049
01:05:59,541 --> 01:06:02,200
因為如果他們知道 他們應該就會叫援軍了
Cos if they did, they'd probably send for reinforcements.

1050
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:03,826
什麼  他們不知道什麼?
What, what don't they know?

1051
01:06:03,837 --> 01:06:05,620
這一次 這裡有我們三個人
This time, there's three of us.

1052
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:07,413
哦!
Oh!

1053
01:06:07,423 --> 01:06:10,333
哦!哦 是的 很好!
Oh! Oh, yes, that is good!

1054
01:06:10,343 --> 01:06:12,043
太棒了!
That is brilliant!

1055
01:06:12,053 --> 01:06:16,172
哦 哦 哦! 我知道了 那太-太棒了!
Oh, oh, oh! I'm getting that too - that is brilliant!

1056
01:06:16,182 --> 01:06:20,551
哈 哈 哈! 我已經想了好幾個世紀了!
Ha-ha-ha! I've been thinking about it for centuries!

1057
01:06:20,562 --> 01:06:23,095
她不是隨便給我看了某一個未來
She didn't just show me any old future -

1058
01:06:23,106 --> 01:06:26,682
她給我看的是正我需要看見的那個未來!
she showed me exactly the future I needed to see!

1059
01:06:26,693 --> 01:06:29,101
現在你明白了
Now you're getting it.
誒? 誰給你看的?
Eh? Who did?

1060
01:06:29,112 --> 01:06:31,521
哦 惡狼女孩 我真該親親你
Oh, Bad Wolf Girl, I could kiss you.

1061
01:06:31,531 --> 01:06:35,399
沒錯 這肯定會發生的
Yep, that's going to happen!
對不起 你剛剛是不是說 "惡狼"?
Sorry, did you say, "Bad Wolf"?

1062
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:37,944
所以我們要怎麼做?
So what are we doing?
計劃是什麼?
What's the plan?

1063
01:06:37,954 --> 01:06:41,405
Dalek艦隊正包圍Gallifrey 持續不斷向它開火
The Dalek fleets are surrounding Gallifrey, firing on it constantly.

1064
01:06:41,416 --> 01:06:44,408
天溝戰壕正在阻擋戰火 但如果整個星球…
The Sky Trench is holding, but what if the whole planet...

1065
01:06:44,419 --> 01:06:46,994
就這麼消失了? 不過是一點小小的要求
just disappeared? Tiny bit of an ask.

1066
01:06:47,005 --> 01:06:48,579
Dalek的炮火就會射向他們自己
The Daleks would be firing on each other -

1067
01:06:48,590 --> 01:06:50,540
他們就會被自己的火力消滅掉
they'd destroy themselves in their own crossfire.

1068
01:06:50,550 --> 01:06:53,042
Gallifrey將會消失 Dalek將被摧毀
Gallifrey would be gone, the Daleks would be destroyed,

1069
01:06:53,052 --> 01:06:55,169
而在宇宙中其他人看來
and it would look to the rest of the universe

1070
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:57,213
好像是他們彼此摧毀殲滅了對方
as if they'd annihilated each other.

1071
01:06:57,223 --> 01:06:59,517
但Gallifrey會在哪兒呢? 完全被凍住!
But where would Gallifrey be? Frozen!

1072
01:07:00,685 --> 01:07:02,969
凍結在一個時間片段裡
Frozen in an instant of time,

1073
01:07:02,979 --> 01:07:05,137
安安全全藏起來
safe and hidden away.

1074
01:07:05,148 --> 01:07:06,264
沒錯!
Exactly!

1075
01:07:06,274 --> 01:07:08,151
像幅畫一樣
Like a painting.

1076
01:07:17,827 --> 01:07:19,193
又來了一個!
ANDROGAR: Another one!

1077
01:07:19,204 --> 01:07:21,445
你確定信息是從他那裡來的？
THE GENERAL: Are you sure the message is from him?

1078
01:07:21,456 --> 01:07:23,208
- 哦 是的!
- Oh, yes!
- 他為什麼要這麼做?
- Why would he do that?

1079
01:07:25,418 --> 01:07:28,202
那個瘋狂的蠢貨事到如今還要說什麼?
What's the mad fool talking about now?

1080
01:07:28,213 --> 01:07:31,122
喂 喂 Gallifrey最高指揮官
Hello, hello, Gallifrey High Command,

1081
01:07:31,132 --> 01:07:32,623
我是博士
this is the Doctor speaking.

1082
01:07:32,634 --> 01:07:35,793
喂 我也是博士 你能聽到我嗎?
Hello! Also the Doctor. Can you hear me?

1083
01:07:35,804 --> 01:07:38,004
還是博士 時刻準備著
Also the Doctor - standing ready.

1084
01:07:38,014 --> 01:07:42,884
天啊 三個他! 我最可怕的噩夢們一下子都出現了!
Dear God, three of them! All my worse nightmares at once!

1085
01:07:42,894 --> 01:07:45,678
將軍 我們有個計劃 我們在這個時候 要提出
'General, we have a plan. We should point out, at this moment,

1086
01:07:45,688 --> 01:07:48,681
一個非常可怕的計劃 而且幾乎完全不可能奏效
it is a fairly terrible plan. And almost certainly won't work.

1087
01:07:48,691 --> 01:07:50,641
我覺得 "非常可怕" 這個用詞很巧妙
I was happy with "fairly terrible".

1088
01:07:50,652 --> 01:07:52,351
不好意思 一想出神就說出來了
Sorry, just thinking out loud.

1089
01:07:52,362 --> 01:07:55,156
我們現在正駕駛著3部TARDIS進入你們的低空大氣層
We're flying our three TARDISes into your lower atmosphere.

1090
01:07:56,658 --> 01:08:00,193
我們正保持著相等間距環繞著星球
We're positioned at equidistant intervals round the globe.

1091
01:08:00,203 --> 01:08:01,746
"相等間距" 聽上去真成熟!
"Equidistant" - so grown-up!

1092
01:08:04,249 --> 01:08:07,450
我們正準備要這麼做
We're just about ready to do it.

1093
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:09,410
準備做什麼?
THE GENERAL: 'Ready to do what?'

1094
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:11,495
我們要凍在Gallifrey
We're going to freeze Gallifrey.

1095
01:08:11,506 --> 01:08:13,497
對不起我沒聽清 你們要什麼?
I'm sorry, what?

1096
01:08:13,508 --> 01:08:15,082
我們將用我們的TARDIS
Using our TARDISes,

1097
01:08:15,093 --> 01:08:17,835
把Gallifrey凍結在一個時間點
we're going to freeze Gallifrey in a single moment in time.

1098
01:08:17,846 --> 01:08:20,213
你知道 就像那些停滯立方體一樣
'You know, like those Stasis Cubes?'

1099
01:08:20,223 --> 01:08:24,342
一個存在於平行口袋宇宙中的時間點
A single moment in time held in a parallel pocket universe.

1100
01:08:24,352 --> 01:08:26,427
只不過我們現在要對整個星球這樣做
Except we're going to do it to a whole planet.

1101
01:08:26,438 --> 01:08:27,720
還有星球上所有人
And all the people on it.

1102
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:30,264
什麼? 就算這是可能的
What? Even if that were possible,

1103
01:08:30,275 --> 01:08:33,476
儘管這事實上並不可能 你們為什麼要這麼做?
'which it isn't, why would you do such a thing?'

1104
01:08:33,486 --> 01:08:36,854
因為另一個選擇是燃燒整個星球 我過去看到了
Because the alternative is burning. And I've seen that.

1105
01:08:36,865 --> 01:08:39,284
而且我永遠不想再看一次
And I never want to see it again.

1106
01:08:40,326 --> 01:08:43,079
我們會迷失在另一個宇宙中...
We'd be lost in another universe...

1107
01:08:44,164 --> 01:08:46,322
..凍結在一個時間點裡
..frozen in a single moment.

1108
01:08:46,332 --> 01:08:48,032
我們會一無所有
We'd have nothing.

1109
01:08:48,042 --> 01:08:49,742
你們會有希望
You would have hope.

1110
01:08:49,752 --> 01:08:52,578
而現在 這正是你們所沒有的
And right now, that is exactly what you don't have.

1111
01:08:52,589 --> 01:08:55,540
一派胡言 只是運算就要
It's delusional. The calculations alone

1112
01:08:55,550 --> 01:08:58,918
花上...幾百年的時間
would take...hundreds of years.

1113
01:08:58,928 --> 01:09:00,253
哦 好幾百年
Oh, hundreds and hundreds.

1114
01:09:00,263 --> 01:09:01,587
但別擔心
But don't worry -

1115
01:09:01,598 --> 01:09:03,975
我很久之前就開始了!
I started a very long time ago!

1116
01:09:07,145 --> 01:09:10,846
呼叫Gallifrey戰爭議會 這裡是博士
Calling the War Council of Gallifrey, this is the Doctor.

1117
01:09:10,857 --> 01:09:14,642
你應該說 我這輩子都在幹這個!
You might say, I've been doing this all my lives!

1118
01:09:14,652 --> 01:09:18,396
祝你好運! 預備
Good luck! Stand by.
準備好了嗎？開始運算
Ready? Commencing calculations.

1119
01:09:18,406 --> 01:09:19,689
馬上就好
Soon be there.

1120
01:09:19,699 --> 01:09:22,400
跨過分割宇宙的界限
'Across the boundaries that divide one universe from another.

1121
01:09:22,410 --> 01:09:24,819
只要鎖住他的坐標
Just got to lock on to his coordinates.

1122
01:09:24,829 --> 01:09:26,404
然後我下一個小花招...!
And for my next trick...!

1123
01:09:26,414 --> 01:09:30,157
我都不知道自己什麼時候這麼走運過! 全部12個!
I didn't know when I was well off! All 12 of them!

1124
01:09:30,168 --> 01:09:31,419
不，長官...
ANDROGAR: No, sir...

1125
01:09:32,796 --> 01:09:34,839
全部13個!
..all 13!

1126
01:09:39,552 --> 01:09:42,378
長官! Dalek察覺到了
Sir! The Daleks know that something is happening.

1127
01:09:42,388 --> 01:09:44,682
他們加強火力了
They're increasing their fire power.

1128
01:09:52,649 --> 01:09:55,016
快做 博士
Do it, Doctor.

1129
01:09:55,026 --> 01:09:56,684
現在就做
Just do it.

1130
01:09:56,694 --> 01:09:58,436
（金屬敲擊聲）
METALLIC THRUMMING

1131
01:09:58,446 --> 01:10:00,323
現在!
Do it!

1132
01:10:01,366 --> 01:10:02,773
好的
OK.

1133
01:10:02,784 --> 01:10:05,328
先生們… 我們準備好了
Gentleman...we're ready.

1134
01:10:07,872 --> 01:10:10,948
Geronimo...!

1135
01:10:10,959 --> 01:10:13,075
Allons-y!

1136
01:10:13,086 --> 01:10:15,620
哦 看在上帝的份上!
Oh, for God's sake!

1137
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:17,882
Gallifrey屹立不倒!
Gallifrey stands!

1138
01:10:35,608 --> 01:10:38,486
我覺得我們永遠不會知道我們到底有沒有成功
I don't suppose we'll ever know if we actually succeeded.

1139
01:10:40,029 --> 01:10:41,437
但就算是最糟糕的情況
But at worst,

1140
01:10:41,448 --> 01:10:43,814
我們也是沒做成正確的事情
we failed doing the right thing,

1141
01:10:43,825 --> 01:10:47,203
而不是做成了錯誤的事情
as opposed to succeeding in doing the wrong.

1142
01:10:49,164 --> 01:10:51,166
生命和靈魂 你們幾個!
Life and soul, you are

1143
01:10:53,293 --> 01:10:55,920
這到底應該叫什麼?
What is it actually called?

1144
01:10:57,338 --> 01:10:59,080
這個嘛 有點爭論
Well, there's some debate.

1145
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:00,748
要麼」終結」
Either No More

1146
01:11:00,758 --> 01:11:02,917
要麼就"Gallifrey的隕落」
or Gallifrey Falls.

1147
01:11:02,927 --> 01:11:04,835
一點也不鼓舞人心
Not very encouraging.

1148
01:11:04,846 --> 01:11:06,222
它是怎麼變成這樣的?
How did it get here?

1149
01:11:07,765 --> 01:11:09,674
不知道
No idea.

1150
01:11:09,684 --> 01:11:12,760
總是有一些我們不知道的事情 不是嗎?
There's always something we don't know, isn't there?

1151
01:11:12,771 --> 01:11:15,054
但願如此
One should certainly hope so.

1152
01:11:15,064 --> 01:11:17,014
好了 先生們...
Well, gentlemen...

1153
01:11:17,025 --> 01:11:19,559
這是我的榮耀
it has been an honour...

1154
01:11:19,569 --> 01:11:21,143
和幸運
and a privilege.

1155
01:11:21,154 --> 01:11:23,615
我也是 博士
Likewise. Doctor.

1156
01:11:26,284 --> 01:11:28,818
若我成長為有你一半好的人
And if I grow to be half the man

1157
01:11:28,828 --> 01:11:32,154
Clara Oswald
that you are, Clara Oswald,

1158
01:11:32,165 --> 01:11:34,198
我就會非常滿足了
I shall be happy indeed.

1159
01:11:34,209 --> 01:11:35,668
這就對了 要胸懷大志!
That's right - aim high!

1160
01:11:42,383 --> 01:11:44,959
我不會記住這些的 對嗎?
I won't remember this, will I?

1161
01:11:44,969 --> 01:11:47,670
時間流沒法同步
The time streams are out of sync.

1162
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:50,047
不 你記不住的
You can't retain it, no.

1163
01:11:50,058 --> 01:11:53,050
所以我也不會記得我曾拯救過Gallifrey
So I won't remember that I tried to save Gallifrey,

1164
01:11:53,061 --> 01:11:54,854
而不是燒掉了它
rather than burn it.

1165
01:11:57,690 --> 01:11:59,359
我不得不接受這個
I'll have to live with that.

1166
01:12:00,902 --> 01:12:02,435
但現在
But for now,

1167
01:12:02,445 --> 01:12:03,613
這一刻...
for this moment...

1168
01:12:05,156 --> 01:12:06,991
我再一次成為了博士
..I am the Doctor again.

1169
01:12:08,868 --> 01:12:10,370
謝謝你
Thank you.

1170
01:12:15,083 --> 01:12:16,626
哪個是我的?!
Which one is mine?!

1171
01:12:18,962 --> 01:12:20,547
哈!
Ha!

1172
01:12:26,970 --> 01:12:29,055
（金屬敲擊聲）
METALLIC THRUMMING

1173
01:12:34,436 --> 01:12:36,636
哦 是的...
Oh, yes...

1174
01:12:36,646 --> 01:12:39,524
沒錯 這就對了…
Course, suppose it makes sense...

1175
01:12:41,067 --> 01:12:43,194
變瘦點
Wearing a bit thin.

1176
01:12:46,489 --> 01:12:50,076
我希望這次耳朵別那麼顯眼了
I hope the ears are bit less conspicuous this time.

1177
01:13:06,718 --> 01:13:09,345
反正我不會記得 所以你最好告訴我
I won't remember either, so you might as well tell me.

1178
01:13:10,930 --> 01:13:12,380
告訴你什麼?
Tell you what?

1179
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:15,268
那個我們會將會去但你卻不想提起的地方
Where it is we're going that you don't want to talk about.

1180
01:13:21,149 --> 01:13:24,016
我看到了Trenzalore...
I saw Trenzalore...

1181
01:13:24,027 --> 01:13:25,528
我們被埋葬的地方
where we're buried.

1182
01:13:26,946 --> 01:13:29,115
我們同數以百萬的人在戰爭中死去
We die in battle among millions.

1183
01:13:30,366 --> 01:13:32,608
這不應該發生的
That's not how it's supposed to be.

1184
01:13:32,619 --> 01:13:35,371
故事就是這麼結束的  我們什麼也做不了
That's how the story ends - nothing we can do about it.

1185
01:13:36,664 --> 01:13:39,250
Trenzalore是你要去的地方
Trenzalore is where you're going.

1186
01:13:41,461 --> 01:13:43,296
哦 永遠別說什麼也做不了
Oh, never say nothing.

1187
01:13:44,339 --> 01:13:46,289
無論如何...
Anyway...

1188
01:13:46,299 --> 01:13:50,178
知道我的未來在可靠的人手裡是個好消息
good to know my future is in safe hands.

1189
01:13:51,596 --> 01:13:53,129
握住別放 Clara
Keep a tight hold on it, Clara.

1190
01:13:53,139 --> 01:13:55,100
嗯! 搞定!
Mm! On it!

1191
01:14:02,232 --> 01:14:03,890
Trenzalore.
Trenzalore.

1192
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:06,694
我們需要一個新的目的地 因為...
We need a new destination, because...

1193
01:14:09,030 --> 01:14:10,824
..我不想去那兒
..I don't want to go.

1194
01:14:15,411 --> 01:14:17,622
（金屬敲擊聲）
METALLIC THRUMMING

1195
01:14:19,958 --> 01:14:21,751
他總是這麼說
He always says that.

1196
01:14:32,178 --> 01:14:33,847
需要和你的畫單獨待會嗎?
Need a moment alone with your painting?

1197
01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:39,978
你怎麼知道的? 那對憂傷的大眼睛 啊
How did you know? Those big, sad eyes. Ah.

1198
01:14:46,317 --> 01:14:47,819
我一直都知道
I always know.

1199
01:14:49,988 --> 01:14:52,980
哦 對了 有個老人在找你
Oh, by the way, there was an old man looking for you.

1200
01:14:52,991 --> 01:14:54,576
我覺得是館長
I think it was the curator.

1201
01:15:04,919 --> 01:15:07,411
我可以當館長
I could be a curator.

1202
01:15:07,422 --> 01:15:08,621
我可以非常擅長策展
I'd be great at curating.

1203
01:15:08,631 --> 01:15:11,468
我可以是個…非常偉大的館長
I'd be...the great curator.

1204
01:15:12,594 --> 01:15:14,387
我可以現在退休然後做這些
I could retire and do that.

1205
01:15:15,972 --> 01:15:19,184
我可以退休了然後做這裡的館長
I could retire and be the curator of this place.

1206
01:15:47,045 --> 01:15:48,536
我每張臉都不會忘記
I never forget a face.

1207
01:15:48,546 --> 01:15:51,372
我知道你不會 然後隨著時間推移
I know you don't, and in years to come,

1208
01:15:51,382 --> 01:15:54,333
你會發現自己在重訪一些面孔
you might find yourself revisiting a few

1209
01:15:54,344 --> 01:15:56,971
但就只是…最喜歡的那幾張老面孔 呃?
but just...the old favourites, eh?

1210
01:16:00,850 --> 01:16:03,551
我覺得你對這幅畫很好奇
You were curious about this painting, I think.

1211
01:16:03,561 --> 01:16:06,846
我是在一個非同尋常的情況下得到它的
I acquired it in remarkable circumstances.

1212
01:16:06,856 --> 01:16:08,764
你覺得這幅畫的標題怎麼樣?
What do you make of the title?

1213
01:16:08,775 --> 01:16:10,860
哪個標題? 它有兩個
Which title? There's two.

1214
01:16:12,570 --> 01:16:13,780
終結
No More...

1215
01:16:15,490 --> 01:16:17,190
還是Gallifrey的隕落?
..or Gallifrey Falls?

1216
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:19,817
哦 你看 這就是大家都弄錯的地方
Oh, you see, that's where everybody's wrong.

1217
01:16:19,828 --> 01:16:21,079
這是同一個標題
It's all one title.

1218
01:16:22,330 --> 01:16:25,907
終結Gallifrey的隕落
Gallifrey Falls No More.

1219
01:16:25,917 --> 01:16:29,963
現在 你覺得這是什麼意思 嗯?
Now, what would you think that means, eh?

1220
01:16:32,924 --> 01:16:34,843
就是Gallifrey沒有隕落
That Gallifrey didn't fall.

1221
01:16:35,885 --> 01:16:38,836
成功了 它仍然在那裡
It worked. It's still out there.

1222
01:16:38,847 --> 01:16:41,380
我只是一個卑微的館長 我肯定不會知道
I'm only a humble curator - I'm sure I wouldn't know.

1223
01:16:41,391 --> 01:16:43,466
- 那它在哪兒呢?
- 到底在哪兒呢?
- Then where is it?
- Where is it indeed?

1224
01:16:43,476 --> 01:16:46,510
消失了  噓!  也許吧
Lost - shh! - perhaps.

1225
01:16:46,521 --> 01:16:49,388
你知道 東西經常會不見的
Things do get lost, you know.

1226
01:16:49,399 --> 01:16:51,390
現在 希望你允許我離開一下
Now you must excuse me.

1227
01:16:51,401 --> 01:16:52,808
哦...
Oh...

1228
01:16:52,819 --> 01:16:55,061
你有很多事情要做
you have a lot to do.

1229
01:16:55,071 --> 01:16:57,730
是嗎? 嗯 這是我現在要做的事情嗎?
Do I? Mm. Is that what I'm supposed to do now?

1230
01:16:57,740 --> 01:17:02,276
- 去找Gallifrey?
- 哦 這完全取決於你 你的選擇
- Go looking for Gallifrey?
- Oh, it's entirely up to you. Your choice.

1231
01:17:02,287 --> 01:17:04,153
我只能告訴你我會做什麼
I can only tell you what I would do,

1232
01:17:04,164 --> 01:17:05,780
如果我是你...
if I were you...

1233
01:17:05,790 --> 01:17:07,365
哦...!如果我是你的話…
Oh...! If I were you...

1234
01:17:08,918 --> 01:17:10,576
也許我曾經是你 當然
Perhaps I WAS you, of course.

1235
01:17:11,671 --> 01:17:13,162
又或者...
Or perhaps...

1236
01:17:13,173 --> 01:17:15,081
你是我
you are me.

1237
01:17:15,091 --> 01:17:16,999
耶! 恭喜恭喜
Yeah! Congratulations.

1238
01:17:17,010 --> 01:17:19,293
非常感謝
Thank you very much.

1239
01:17:19,304 --> 01:17:22,880
或許不管誰是誰都無所謂
Or perhaps it doesn't matter either way.

1240
01:17:22,891 --> 01:17:25,258
誰知道呢?
Who knows?

1241
01:17:25,268 --> 01:17:28,104
究竟是誰…知道呢?
Who...knows?

1242
01:17:44,037 --> 01:17:47,530
Clara有時問我會不會做夢
Clara sometimes asks me if I dream.

1243
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:50,032
"我當然會做夢" 我告訴她
"Course I dream," I tell her.

1244
01:17:50,043 --> 01:17:52,451
每個人都會做夢
"Everybody dreams.

1245
01:17:52,462 --> 01:17:55,454
但你都夢到些什麼 她問
' "But what do you dream about?" she'll ask.

1246
01:17:55,465 --> 01:17:59,208
和每個人夢到的一樣 我告訴她
"The same thing everybody dreams about," I tell her.

1247
01:17:59,219 --> 01:18:01,878
我夢到我要去的地方
"I dream about where I'm going."

1248
01:18:01,888 --> 01:18:04,046
她總是因為這個哈哈大笑
'She always laughs at that.

1249
01:18:04,057 --> 01:18:07,341
但你哪裡都不去 你只是在亂晃
"But you're not going anywhere - you're just wandering about."

1250
01:18:07,352 --> 01:18:10,688
不是這樣的 以後都不會了
'That's not true. Not any more.

1251
01:18:12,607 --> 01:18:14,557
我有了一個新的目的地
'I have a new destination.

1252
01:18:14,567 --> 01:18:18,269
我的旅途和你的一樣 和所有人的都一樣
'My journey is the same as yours, the same as anyone's.

1253
01:18:18,279 --> 01:18:21,397
它花費了我這麼多年 這麼多次轉生
'It's taken me so many years, so many lifetimes,

1254
01:18:21,407 --> 01:18:24,942
但我終於我要去哪裡了
'but at last I know where I'm going,

1255
01:18:24,953 --> 01:18:26,830
我一直試圖去那個的地方
'where I've always been going.

1256
01:18:28,873 --> 01:18:32,252
我那很遠很遠的...家
Home...the long way round.
