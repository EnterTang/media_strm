00:00:01,112 --> 00:00:04,472
Hi I'm Bryan Fuller, executive producer of
NBC's Hannibal

2
00:00:04,597 --> 00:00:07,263
and I'm here to announce
that we have cannibalized

3
00:00:07,388 --> 00:00:09,510
one of our episodes entitled "Ceuf"

4
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:13,320
to create a webseries
that details the relationship

5
00:00:13,445 --> 00:00:16,391
between Hannibal Lecter and
Abigail Hobbs.

6
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,732
One of the things that was very exciting
for me in doing this series was to see

7
00:00:19,857 --> 00:00:22,618
Hannibal outside of incarceration
in relationships

8
00:00:22,743 --> 00:00:25,859
with characters not only Jack Crawford
and Will Graham

9
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:29,196
but inparticular Abigail Hobbs
played by Kacey Rohl.

10
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:32,248
you'll notice that as the series goes on

11
00:00:32,373 --> 00:00:35,584
this relationship gets much more
complicated and

12
00:00:35,709 --> 00:00:38,541
becomes a load bearing element
of our story telling so

13
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,373
we wanted to make sure that you have

14
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:43,343
all the scenes in order to
follow the story along

15
00:00:43,468 --> 00:00:46,490
as we pulled the episode in it's entirety.

16
00:00:46,615 --> 00:00:49,069
out of sensitivities to some
of the subject matter that

17
00:00:49,194 --> 00:00:50,583
is contained within the episode.

18
00:00:51,032 --> 00:00:54,846
So, that episode will be available
online and in other markets

19
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,988
just not in the United States,
on NBC.

20
00:00:58,113 --> 00:01:00,478
So, I don't wanna give to many spoilers

21
00:01:00,603 --> 00:01:03,146
for those of you who want to
seek that episode out.

22
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,269
So please enjoy this starter
of the webisodes that will lead you up

23
00:01:06,394 --> 00:01:08,942
to our main course thursdays at ten

24
00:01:09,067 --> 00:01:11,072
live on NBC.

25
00:01:11,853 --> 00:01:13,580
Thank you for watching,
and Bon Appetit.

27
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:21,540
Sometimes...

28
00:01:23,434 --> 00:01:26,747
at night I Ieave the lights on
in my little house.

29
00:01:28,515 --> 00:01:31,828
And... walk across the flat fields

30
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:37,814
When I look back from a distance,
the house is like a boat on the sea.

31
00:01:40,914 --> 00:01:44,021
It's really the only time I feel safe.

32
00:01:46,686 --> 00:01:50,188
You stood in the breathing silence of
Gareth Jacob Hobbs' home,

33
00:01:50,313 --> 00:01:52,446
the very spaces he moved through.

34
00:01:53,121 --> 00:01:56,741
Tell me Will... Did they speak to you?

35
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:02,498
WIth noise and clarity.

36
00:02:03,484 --> 00:02:07,033
You could sense his madness,
like a bloodhound...

37
00:02:07,158 --> 00:02:10,256
I tried so hard to know
Gareth Jacob Hobbs.

38
00:02:13,918 --> 00:02:15,054
To see him.

39
00:02:15,179 --> 00:02:17,221
<i>Gareth Jacob Hobbs, FBI!</i>

40
00:02:21,963 --> 00:02:25,606
Past the slides and viles,

41
00:02:25,731 --> 00:02:27,925
beyond the lines of the police report,

42
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,694
between the pixels of all those

43
00:02:32,373 --> 00:02:35,638
printed faces of sad dead girls.

44
00:02:38,927 --> 00:02:40,347
<i>See.</i>

45
00:02:45,221 --> 00:02:48,586
How did you feel seeing Marissa Shore,
impaled in his antler room?

46
00:02:55,868 --> 00:02:57,193
Guilty.

47
00:02:58,423 --> 00:02:59,842
Because you couldn't save her.

48
00:03:01,238 --> 00:03:03,142
Because I felt like I killed her...

49
00:03:06,585 --> 00:03:08,549
I got so close to him.

50
00:03:11,104 --> 00:03:12,524
Sometimes...

51
00:03:13,186 --> 00:03:16,120
I felt like we were doing the same things
at different times of day

52
00:03:16,245 --> 00:03:17,847
like I was eating

53
00:03:18,249 --> 00:03:21,785
or showering or sleeping
at the same time he was.

54
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,640
Even after he was dead?

55
00:03:27,402 --> 00:03:29,251
Even after he was dead.

56
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,430
Like...

57
00:03:30,998 --> 00:03:32,725
you were becoming him.

58
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:37,055
I know who I am.

59
00:03:37,386 --> 00:03:40,178
I'm not Gareth Jacob Hobbs,
Doctor Lecter.

60
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:04,190

61
00:06:10,321 --> 00:06:14,420

62
00:06:18,522 --> 00:06:21,057
I can hide what happened to me.

63
00:06:21,402 --> 00:06:23,499
All I need is a scarf to pass.

64
00:06:24,144 --> 00:06:27,088
Hiding what happened to you
defeats the purpose of being here.

65
00:06:27,785 --> 00:06:29,490
Sharing will help normalize.

66
00:06:29,905 --> 00:06:32,762
I'm not normal... not anymore.

67
00:06:33,914 --> 00:06:35,680
What happened to you was a...

68
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,739
Some of these women
aren't even sharing.

69
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,997
They speak in "little girl voices"

70
00:06:40,122 --> 00:06:42,901
telling everyone what was done to them
without saying a word about it.

71
00:06:43,315 --> 00:06:46,081
Certain traumas can
arrest vocal development.

72
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:51,219
And victims can sometimes broadcast
victimhood involuntarily.

73
00:06:52,555 --> 00:06:53,684
Not me.

74
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,619
That's not necessarily true.

75
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:01,206
Your victimhood has a high profile.

76
00:07:01,331 --> 00:07:02,717
celebrity victim.

77
00:07:04,376 --> 00:07:07,464
Someone here asked me
if I kept my stained clothes.

78
00:07:08,087 --> 00:07:09,399
How did that make you feel?

79
00:07:09,883 --> 00:07:12,348
Like I wanted to go home.

80
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,012
But I don't have a home anymore, do I?

81
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:19,933
You will. You will,
I'll help you find it.

82
00:07:23,017 --> 00:07:25,647
Abigail I'd like you to give
the support group another chance.

83
00:07:25,772 --> 00:07:28,178
Supportgroups are
sucking the life out of me.

84
00:07:29,284 --> 00:07:31,634
Well isolation can suck just as much.

85
00:07:32,256 --> 00:07:35,459
You have to find someone to relate to
in this experience.

86
00:07:43,373 --> 00:07:44,283
Hi.

87
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:48,378
- Do you have an appointment?
- Do you have a beer?

88
00:07:57,163 --> 00:07:58,983
Interesting day with Abigail?

89
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:05,296
Yeah, with grief work.

90
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:07,093
Trauma, intervention.

91
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,420
It's all on course.

92
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,614
I think she might be wrestling
with a low grade depression.

93
00:08:16,448 --> 00:08:17,532
She?

94
00:08:18,222 --> 00:08:22,001
Nothing wrong with a little
self medication, right Doctor?

95
00:08:25,181 --> 00:08:27,554
Professional neutrality be damned.

96
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:31,587
It's so hard to watch
a bright young girl go so adrift.

97
00:08:32,163 --> 00:08:35,112
Perhaps it's time Abigail is released
from clinical treatment.

98
00:08:35,237 --> 00:08:36,956
Released where?

99
00:08:37,946 --> 00:08:39,214
Back into the wild?

100
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:42,932
Spending each day immersed in tragedy
may be doing more harm than good.

101
00:08:43,407 --> 00:08:45,089
She should be out in the world.

102
00:08:45,412 --> 00:08:48,176
Finding her footing, giving her
the confidence to move forward.

103
00:08:48,301 --> 00:08:51,518
Abigail is in no condition
to tackle her real world issues.

104
00:08:51,643 --> 00:08:53,706
- Where's she gonna live?
- I'm not suggesting abandonment.

105
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,907
Hannibal this is a girl who was
very attached to her parents.

106
00:08:59,032 --> 00:09:02,243
You stepping in as a surrogate,
would only be a crutch.

107
00:09:02,992 --> 00:09:06,379
I think Abigail need to figure
things out for herself in a safe

108
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,223
clinical environment.

109
00:09:08,822 --> 00:09:11,241
And that will give her
the confidence to move forward.

110
00:09:11,366 --> 00:09:14,029
I defer to the passion
of my esteemed colleague.

111
00:09:14,672 --> 00:09:16,216
Passion's good.

112
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:18,271
Gets blood pumping.

113
00:09:18,718 --> 00:09:22,372

114
00:09:23,695 --> 00:09:27,838
- Tell me about your mother.
- Some lazy psychiatry Doctor Lecter.

115
00:09:28,512 --> 00:09:30,047
Low hanging fruit.

116
00:09:31,157 --> 00:09:33,379
I suspect that fruit is on a high branch.

117
00:09:34,053 --> 00:09:36,574
- Very difficult to reach.
- So is my mother.

118
00:09:37,672 --> 00:09:40,849
- Never knew her.
- An interesting place to start.

119
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:45,734
Tell me about your mother,
let's start there.

120
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,376
Both my parents died
when I was very young.

121
00:09:51,275 --> 00:09:55,614
The proverbial orphan until I was adopted
by my uncle Robertos when I was 16.

122
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,742
You have orphan in common
with Abigail Hobbs.

123
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:02,203
I think you'll discover that you and I have
a great deal in common with Abigail.

124
00:10:03,676 --> 00:10:06,720
She's already demonstrated an aptitude
for the psychological.

125
00:10:09,017 --> 00:10:12,312
There's something so foreign about family,

126
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:14,857
like an ill fitting suit.

127
00:10:15,731 --> 00:10:18,327
I never connected to the concept.

128
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,845
I followed my father
from the boatyards of

129
00:10:22,245 --> 00:10:26,488
Biloxi and Greenville,
to lakeboats on Eerie.

130
00:10:27,186 --> 00:10:30,107
Always the new boy at school,
always the stranger.

131
00:10:30,232 --> 00:10:31,942
Always.

132
00:10:32,678 --> 00:10:34,450
You created a family for yourself.

133
00:10:35,548 --> 00:10:39,242
I've only connected a family of strays,

134
00:10:39,816 --> 00:10:42,736
and thank you for feeding them
while I was away.

135
00:10:45,457 --> 00:10:47,207
I was refering to Abigail.

136
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:56,214
A modified Budeaux Noir
from Ali Bab's Gatronomie Practique.

137
00:10:58,835 --> 00:11:01,221
You promised to deliver
your wife to my dinner table.

138
00:11:01,346 --> 00:11:03,752
Well we'll have to polish up our act,
we can't have

139
00:11:03,877 --> 00:11:06,622
you diagnosing our marital problems
all in one fell swoop.

140
00:11:07,721 --> 00:11:10,092
- What am I about to put in my mouth?
- Rabbit.

141
00:11:10,217 --> 00:11:13,442
- He should have hopped faster.
- Yes he should have.

142
00:11:16,257 --> 00:11:19,152
- But fortunately for us he did not.
- Mmm mmm.

143
00:11:22,366 --> 00:11:25,537
Our friend Will seems haunted today.

144
00:11:25,662 --> 00:11:28,910
We don't know what nightmares
lie coiled beneath Will's pillow.

145
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,545
He still suspects Abigail Hobbs
in her father's crimes.

146
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,747
Perhaps the nightmare under Will's pillow,

147
00:11:37,221 --> 00:11:39,301
is that he was wrong about her.

148
00:11:39,426 --> 00:11:41,589
Children tranport us to our childhoods.

149
00:11:42,413 --> 00:11:45,682
Will may feel the tug of life
before the FBI, before you.

150
00:11:46,157 --> 00:11:48,303
Simpler times in boatyards with dad.

151
00:11:48,927 --> 00:11:52,172
That life is an anker streamed behind him
in heavy weather.

152
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,641
He needs an anker Jack.

00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,321
Good evening Will, please come in.

155
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:35,917
Has christmas come early?
Or late?

156
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,415
- Was for Abigail.
- Was?

157
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,360
I thought better of it, I wasn't thinking
straight, I was upset when I bought it.

158
00:12:45,092 --> 00:12:46,588
Maybe still am.

159
00:12:47,596 --> 00:12:49,988
- What is it?
- A magnifying glass.

160
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,958
Fly tying gear.

161
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,657
Teaching her how to fish,

162
00:12:57,305 --> 00:13:01,554
- her father taught her how to hunt.
- That's why I thought better of it.

163
00:13:02,877 --> 00:13:06,316
- Pretty paternal Will.
- Aren't you?

164
00:13:06,441 --> 00:13:07,442
Yes.

165
00:13:08,815 --> 00:13:11,517
Our good friend Doctor Bloom
has advised against taking

166
00:13:11,642 --> 00:13:14,198
to personal an interest
in Abigail's welfare.

167
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,877
And perhaps it's our responsibility

168
00:13:18,002 --> 00:13:20,213
yours and mine to help her find her way.

169
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:32,370
I don't think I'm allowed to leave,
after I climb the fence.

170
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,128
I've made arrangements.

171
00:13:35,253 --> 00:13:38,337
you could say I'm, one of your guardians.

172
00:13:39,473 --> 00:13:42,981
- Where are we going?
- Home, my home.

173
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,161
I thought you might enjoy
if I cooked for you.

174
00:13:46,864 --> 00:13:50,318
- I'll have you back before bedtime.
- Can't I spend the night?

175
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:54,656
I don't like sleeping here,
I have bad dreams.

176
00:13:55,729 --> 00:13:59,388
- You have to sleep in your own bed.
- This isn't my bed.

177
00:14:01,245 --> 00:14:03,790
Tell me about your bad dreams.

178
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,787
I had one where

179
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,911
Marissa was sending me picture texts.

180
00:14:13,383 --> 00:14:17,174
Like crimescene photos of Nicholas Boyle.

181
00:14:17,962 --> 00:14:20,973
- Gutted.
- How you left him.

182
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:30,402
Even though she's dead
I'm afraid that Marissa's gonna

183
00:14:30,527 --> 00:14:34,286
tell everyone I killed him
and they'll think I'm just like my dad.

184
00:14:36,003 --> 00:14:37,213
Sorry.

185
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,349
Can't really talk about this in group.

186
00:14:42,328 --> 00:14:44,247
You don't have that luxury Abigail.

187
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:47,428
I just have to get used to lying.

188
00:14:51,712 --> 00:14:53,704
You only have to lie about one thing.

189
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,825
And when you're with me
you don't have to lie about anything.

190
00:14:59,838 --> 00:15:04,116
In the dream I wonder
how I could live with myself.

191
00:15:04,847 --> 00:15:07,296
Knowing what I did.

192
00:15:07,858 --> 00:15:10,054
And when you're awake?

193
00:15:10,814 --> 00:15:13,488
When I'm awake I know I can
live with myself.

194
00:15:14,191 --> 00:15:16,809
And I'll just get used to what I did.

195
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,734
- Does that make me a sociopath?
- No.

196
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:24,717
It makes you a survivor.

197
00:15:28,623 --> 00:15:32,535

198
00:15:33,954 --> 00:15:37,030

199
00:15:51,554 --> 00:15:53,640
It's important to know
when it's time to turn the page.

200
00:15:54,364 --> 00:15:56,184
Have you thought about
applying for schools?

201
00:15:57,164 --> 00:16:00,529
My dad killed girls
from all the schools I applied to.

202
00:16:02,532 --> 00:16:06,528
- Perhaps that can wait then.
- I wanna work for the FBI.

203
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:12,473
I would certainly feel safer
if you were in the FBI,

204
00:16:13,064 --> 00:16:14,759
protecting my interests.

205
00:16:14,884 --> 00:16:17,045
They wouldn't let me though,
would they?

206
00:16:18,714 --> 00:16:19,922
Because of what my dad did.

207
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:22,156
Only if they believe
that's in your nature too.

208
00:16:22,585 --> 00:16:24,129
Nature versus nurture.

209
00:16:24,802 --> 00:16:27,966
You're not your father's daughter,
not anymore.

210
00:16:34,206 --> 00:16:38,184
What if it weren't so painful anymore,
to think of him.

211
00:16:40,062 --> 00:16:42,142
- My dad?
- Yes.

212
00:16:44,813 --> 00:16:47,152
Have you ever tried Psilocybin?

213
00:16:48,076 --> 00:16:52,134
- Mushrooms? That's what's in the tea?
- Yes.

214
00:16:52,865 --> 00:16:56,757
There are those psychiatrists who believe
altered states could be used

215
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:57,476
to access traumatic memories.

216
00:16:57,601 --> 00:17:00,404
I have all the access to
traumatic memories I need.

217
00:17:00,815 --> 00:17:02,292
Unlimited access.

218
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:05,712
Which is why we need to supplement them
with positive associations.

219
00:17:05,837 --> 00:17:08,777
No more bad dreams Abigail.

220
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:14,274
- You want me to do drugs?
- I want you to do this drug.

221
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:17,715
With my supervision it's quite safe.

222
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,105
Do you trust me?

223
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:54,302
Just like we talked about.

224
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:09,816
Doctor Bloom said this was ok.

225
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:13,643
Not at all, we often
have a difference of opinion.

226
00:18:18,075 --> 00:18:20,630
- More secrets for us.
- Well.

227
00:18:21,036 --> 00:18:23,969
You and I will have many secrets.

228
00:18:28,877 --> 00:18:32,368
Infusing Psilosybin into the bloodstream
before psychotherapy

229
00:18:32,493 --> 00:18:36,683
can illicit a positive even spiritual
experience for patients.

230
00:18:37,171 --> 00:18:39,970
Psychological trauma is an affliction
of the powerless.

231
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,412
I want to give you your power back.

232
00:18:44,363 --> 00:18:46,340
I don't feel so good.

233
00:18:47,573 --> 00:18:49,807
That feeling will pass.

234
00:18:51,914 --> 00:18:55,073
Allow it to wash over you, through you.

235
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,824
Let me be your guide.

236
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,412
You're making breakfast for dinner?

237
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:06,272
*** for eggs.

238
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:10,818
A chef in Spain called Muro claimed
he invented it in the 19th century.

239
00:19:13,797 --> 00:19:17,385
Taste, is not only biochemical...
it's also psychological.

240
00:19:18,086 --> 00:19:21,181
Sausage and eggs was the last meal
I was having with my parents.

241
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:25,483
I know. It's also the first meal
you're having with me.

242
00:19:26,588 --> 00:19:29,721

243
00:19:29,994 --> 00:19:32,724

244
00:19:33,113 --> 00:19:35,798
As someone who makes such a deal
about common courtesy

245
00:19:35,923 --> 00:19:37,187
I'm a little taken a back.

246
00:19:37,574 --> 00:19:41,441
Slash a lot taken a back,
that you would take my patient

247
00:19:41,566 --> 00:19:42,900
<i>my patient</i>

248
00:19:43,025 --> 00:19:45,381
out of the hospital without my permission.

249
00:19:48,341 --> 00:19:50,093
And I'm not a professional scold

250
00:19:51,004 --> 00:19:53,303
but don't put me
in this position ever again.

251
00:19:56,717 --> 00:19:57,946
I'm sorry.

252
00:19:59,016 --> 00:20:01,712
Rude! Hannibal shockingly rude!

253
00:20:01,837 --> 00:20:05,025
You have every right to be upset with me
I overstepped my bounds.

254
00:20:07,256 --> 00:20:10,033
- Where is she?
- She's in the dining room.

255
00:20:17,453 --> 00:20:20,571
And Alana... you were right.

256
00:20:22,825 --> 00:20:25,374
Often am. You have to be more specific.

257
00:20:26,854 --> 00:20:28,401
She wasn't ready to leave the hospital,

258
00:20:28,526 --> 00:20:32,157
she... experienced a bit of anxiety
so I gave her a sedative.

259
00:20:33,978 --> 00:20:36,687
- Sedative what did you give her?
- I only gave her half a Valium

260
00:20:36,812 --> 00:20:38,440
but she may be a little hazy.

261
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:46,020
- Hi Doctor Bloom.
- Hello Abigail.

262
00:20:49,366 --> 00:20:50,822
You were expecting me?

263
00:20:52,644 --> 00:20:53,873
Please.

264
00:21:00,201 --> 00:21:01,908
You hungry?

265
00:21:02,773 --> 00:21:04,775
Hannibal made breakfast for dinner.

266
00:21:06,256 --> 00:21:07,735
I could eat.

267
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:15,725
What is it?

268
00:21:20,027 --> 00:21:20,892
Abigail.

269
00:21:23,987 --> 00:21:25,102
What do you see?

270
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:32,045
I see family.

271
00:21:41,946 --> 00:21:43,105
Hello.

272
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,321
Think it's to late for us to have kids?

273
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:11,093
It is for me.

274
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:49,806
