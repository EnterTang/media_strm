00:00:10,067 --> 00:00:11,312
<i>When I was a teenager,</i>

2
00:00:11,313 --> 00:00:13,254
<i>I discovered a lot of new things.</i>

3
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,487
<i>I discovered sour milk
doesn't always become yogurt.</i>

4
00:00:19,336 --> 00:00:23,394
<i>I discovered the barber who's always
available isn't always the best.</i>

5
00:00:27,975 --> 00:00:29,055
Next!

6
00:00:29,252 --> 00:00:31,703
<i>I also discovered that
if you hit people with a truck,</i>

7
00:00:31,704 --> 00:00:33,527
<i>they will do anything you want.</i>

8
00:00:38,323 --> 00:00:39,649
<i>Another thing I discovered</i>

9
00:00:39,685 --> 00:00:43,367
<i>is if you're gonna buy cheap furniture,
you better stock up on Crazy Glue.</i>

10
00:00:43,368 --> 00:00:45,360
Ma, how come this table keeps wobbling?

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,192
I don't know.
Your daddy was supposed to fix it.

12
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,913
Chris, go get your father's Crazy Glue.

13
00:00:50,973 --> 00:00:52,477
<i>If we didn't have Crazy Glue,</i>

14
00:00:52,477 --> 00:00:54,712
<i>this would have happened to our house.</i>

15
00:00:58,251 --> 00:00:59,486
<i>And I also discovered</i>

16
00:00:59,522 --> 00:01:01,632
<i>something that would
change my life forever.</i>

17
00:01:05,323 --> 00:01:06,614
Playboy magazine?

18
00:01:10,174 --> 00:01:13,125
1x20 Everybody Hates Playboy

20
00:01:45,395 --> 00:01:47,592
<i>Discovering Playboy changed my life.</i>

21
00:01:48,096 --> 00:01:50,743
<i>It was a foldout
of the most beautiful women,</i>

22
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,125
<i>with jokes on the back,
football stats, cars,</i>

23
00:01:54,302 --> 00:01:56,756
<i>and an interview
with McLean Stevenson.</i>

24
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:58,400
<i>I thought Keisha was cute,</i>

25
00:01:58,568 --> 00:02:02,156
<i>but I'd push her in front of a gas truck
to get to Miss June.</i>

26
00:02:07,136 --> 00:02:09,980
Oh, my God, this kicks
ass on the Sears catalogue.

27
00:02:10,015 --> 00:02:11,377
Does your dad know you took this?

28
00:02:11,412 --> 00:02:14,295
No, I gotta get it back to him
before he finds out it's gone.

29
00:02:14,296 --> 00:02:15,648
Wow. Is that a Playboy?

30
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:17,506
None of your business.
Now get out of here.

31
00:02:17,553 --> 00:02:18,657
Come on.

32
00:02:18,915 --> 00:02:20,738
I'll give you a dollar to look.

33
00:02:23,216 --> 00:02:24,216
Okay, fine.

34
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,230
Right here, one minute.

35
00:02:26,536 --> 00:02:27,804
Greg, give it to him.

36
00:02:27,862 --> 00:02:30,960
<i>Who knew you could make money
off of naked women?</i>

37
00:02:40,023 --> 00:02:42,101
What? The truck break down again?

38
00:02:42,197 --> 00:02:43,197
No.

39
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,417
I tried to kill a spider,
and I broke the handle off the dresser.

40
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,477
- Spider?
- Yeah.

41
00:02:47,513 --> 00:02:49,074
I don't know where they're coming from,

42
00:02:49,098 --> 00:02:50,636
but we got to do something about them.

43
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:52,666
You know,
Drew is scared to death of spiders.

44
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:54,617
<i>My brother Drew
wasn't scared of anything,</i>

45
00:02:54,618 --> 00:02:55,917
<i>but after he saw The Fly,</i>

46
00:02:55,918 --> 00:02:57,565
<i>he was terrified of spiders.</i>

47
00:03:08,031 --> 00:03:11,186
<i>I don't want to tell you what happened
after he saw Urban Cowboy.</i>

48
00:03:11,187 --> 00:03:14,289
Okay, I-I'll go
get some bug spray after work.

49
00:03:14,548 --> 00:03:17,312
Okay. Where's the Crazy Glue
so I can fix this?

50
00:03:17,601 --> 00:03:19,189
It should be in my toolbox.

51
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,198
Okay.

52
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:22,458
No, no, no, no.

53
00:03:22,658 --> 00:03:24,815
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What's wrong with you?

54
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,049
- Let me fix it.
- I know what to do with Crazy Glue.

55
00:03:27,085 --> 00:03:29,023
No, it's trickier than you might think.
I mean,

56
00:03:29,047 --> 00:03:31,117
you might glue your fingers together.
Let me do it.

57
00:03:31,118 --> 00:03:32,118
Okay then, damn.

58
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,213
Okay. Thank you. Okay.

59
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:38,276
<i>My father knew that if my mother
ever found that Playboy,</i>

60
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:41,015
<i>he'd probably never see
a naked woman again.</i>

61
00:03:42,787 --> 00:03:45,257
<i>Unfortunately,
he couldn't find it either.</i>

62
00:03:47,307 --> 00:03:50,044
<i>I soon discovered that
trying to keep a Playboy magazine</i>

63
00:03:50,045 --> 00:03:54,162
<i>from a teenage boy is like trying
to keep diamond teeth from a rapper.</i>

64
00:03:54,331 --> 00:03:57,055
<i>Somebody's going to get that money,
might as well be me.</i>

65
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,217
Quarter a peek and...
you're done.

66
00:03:59,249 --> 00:04:01,933
You're next.
A dollar a look, a quarter a peek.

67
00:04:01,934 --> 00:04:02,934
Thank you.

68
00:04:04,087 --> 00:04:05,381
Okay, time's up. Next.

69
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:07,042
I'm next.

70
00:04:07,244 --> 00:04:10,244
<i>I found the one thing
that united the races--women.</i>

71
00:04:10,742 --> 00:04:11,742
Thanks, Mantan.

72
00:04:11,828 --> 00:04:13,003
Hey, give it back.

73
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,197
That's my dad's.

74
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:15,828
Like your father can read.

75
00:04:18,817 --> 00:04:22,217
<i>My father could ask my mother
if anybody had been in the toolbox,</i>

76
00:04:22,218 --> 00:04:25,041
<i>but he knew questions
made my mother suspicious.</i>

77
00:04:25,252 --> 00:04:27,037
Ma, can I go play over
at Tricia's house?

78
00:04:27,072 --> 00:04:28,622
What you need to go over her house for?

79
00:04:28,645 --> 00:04:30,550
What you gonna do over there
you can't do here?

80
00:04:30,585 --> 00:04:32,289
And why you acting all suspicious?

81
00:04:34,045 --> 00:04:35,268
Hey, mom, what time is it?

82
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:36,690
What you need to know the time for?

83
00:04:36,726 --> 00:04:38,497
What are you going to do,
go rob a bank?

84
00:04:38,498 --> 00:04:39,968
You're acting suspicious.

85
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,445
Ma, can I have some more potatoes?

86
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:42,898
What you need more potatoes for?

87
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:43,798
Boy, you getting high?

88
00:04:43,799 --> 00:04:45,622
You starting to act suspicious.

89
00:04:48,658 --> 00:04:50,121
Julius, what are you doing?

90
00:04:52,521 --> 00:04:55,080
I-I thought I saw a spider
crawl under here,

91
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:58,411
and I figured I'd better kill it
before Drew saw it.

92
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,126
Oh, well, I'm going to the store
to pick up some stuff for dinner.

93
00:05:01,127 --> 00:05:02,977
I'll get a can of bug spray, too.

94
00:05:02,978 --> 00:05:03,927
Okay.

95
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,575
Did you fix the dresser yet?

96
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:08,512
Got the Crazy Glue right here.

97
00:05:08,562 --> 00:05:09,562
Oh, good.

98
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:11,211
You okay?

99
00:05:11,282 --> 00:05:12,282
<i>No.</i>

100
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:13,733
Yeah.

101
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,879
Okay.

102
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:22,800
<i>The only place my father hadn't looked
for that Playboy was in his own room.</i>

103
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:25,056
<i>Then he realized
that if my mother found it,</i>

104
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:27,527
<i>she could be saving it
to use against him.</i>

105
00:05:27,862 --> 00:05:30,912
Rochelle, why'd you spend
all this money on a coat?

106
00:05:33,372 --> 00:05:34,899
Miss June has one.

107
00:05:58,482 --> 00:05:59,722
$500?

108
00:06:02,032 --> 00:06:03,032
H ey.

109
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:05,181
What do you want, Tito?

110
00:06:05,182 --> 00:06:06,328
I need the magazine back.

111
00:06:06,363 --> 00:06:08,773
You need to get out of here,
before I knock your teeth out.

112
00:06:08,808 --> 00:06:11,145
Listen, my dad's going to kill me
if I don't get it back.

113
00:06:11,168 --> 00:06:12,941
Too bad.
I sold it.

114
00:06:13,154 --> 00:06:15,128
See you at your funeral, Slappy.

115
00:06:18,602 --> 00:06:20,420
<i>After my father found that money,</i>

116
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,422
<i>he was scared to think
what my mother might want to do with it.</i>

117
00:06:23,423 --> 00:06:25,289
I'm sick of you.
I got my own money.

118
00:06:25,523 --> 00:06:27,581
I'm out of here, you cheap bastard!

119
00:06:30,832 --> 00:06:31,832
Baby.

120
00:06:32,165 --> 00:06:33,617
Don't leave me, baby.

121
00:06:34,091 --> 00:06:35,091
Don't leave.

122
00:06:36,342 --> 00:06:38,527
Rochelle.
Can you explain this?

123
00:06:39,592 --> 00:06:41,357
- Where did you find that?
- In your shoe.

124
00:06:41,445 --> 00:06:44,768
- Well, what were you doing in my shoe?
- Oh, don't try to change the subject.

125
00:06:44,855 --> 00:06:47,422
What's $500 doing in your shoe?

126
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:48,561
Where'd you get this?

127
00:06:48,562 --> 00:06:50,385
That doesn't make a difference.

128
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:53,212
I want to know why
you were going through my stuff.

129
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:54,561
I don't go through your stuff.

130
00:06:54,562 --> 00:06:55,562
Yes, she does.

131
00:06:55,571 --> 00:06:56,770
He just never caught her.

132
00:06:56,771 --> 00:06:58,594
Rochelle, that's not the point.

133
00:06:58,726 --> 00:07:01,262
- I just want to know about this money.
- You mean my money?

134
00:07:01,286 --> 00:07:02,292
What you mean your money?

135
00:07:02,293 --> 00:07:04,272
I made it, I saved it, so it's my money.

136
00:07:04,495 --> 00:07:05,763
Let me get this straight.

137
00:07:05,891 --> 00:07:08,420
The money I make,
that's everybody's money,

138
00:07:08,842 --> 00:07:11,161
but the money you make,
that's your money?

139
00:07:11,204 --> 00:07:12,273
That's right.

140
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,684
Hey, any of you guys
see my copy of Playboy?

141
00:07:18,765 --> 00:07:20,420
It was here about ten minutes ago,

142
00:07:20,421 --> 00:07:22,170
but some eighth grader took it.

143
00:07:22,171 --> 00:07:23,210
Hey, look over there.

144
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,282
They were huddled up like
they were going to run

145
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,243
the winning play at the Super Bowl.

146
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:31,627
- What are you doing?
- Hey, calm down.

147
00:07:31,657 --> 00:07:33,113
You want to take a look? It's $1.00.

148
00:07:33,148 --> 00:07:35,073
Yeah, but it's my magazine.
Caruso took it.

149
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,290
And that's my problem?

150
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,291
All right, who wants to look next?

151
00:07:38,423 --> 00:07:39,597
Hey, Chris!

152
00:07:56,593 --> 00:07:58,063
To whom does this belong?

153
00:07:58,293 --> 00:07:59,704
<i>It used to belong to me.</i>

154
00:08:01,452 --> 00:08:02,452
Well, then.

155
00:08:02,552 --> 00:08:05,611
Until we figure out
who brought this into our school,

156
00:08:05,612 --> 00:08:07,082
I guess it belongs to me.

157
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:20,174
What's all that bug's spray
in the kitchen for?

158
00:08:20,224 --> 00:08:21,834
There's a spider in your room.

159
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:23,119
There's a spider in my room?

160
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,573
Can I sleep with you and Dad tonight
until you guys catch it?

161
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:27,394
No. Your father will kill it.

162
00:08:27,783 --> 00:08:30,381
<i>When Tonya discovered
Drew was scared of spiders,</i>

163
00:08:30,382 --> 00:08:32,241
<i>she couldn't wait
to use it against him.</i>

164
00:08:32,242 --> 00:08:34,950
Julius, can you make sure
you kill the spider, please?

165
00:08:34,951 --> 00:08:36,774
I might not be able to find it.

166
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:39,177
Could be hiding in one of your shoes.

167
00:08:43,411 --> 00:08:44,411
It's my hand.

168
00:08:44,446 --> 00:08:47,581
Julius, how come
you're acting so childish about this?

169
00:08:47,617 --> 00:08:49,718
I mean, how would you feel
if somebody went through

170
00:08:49,753 --> 00:08:51,847
your stuff and took something
that belonged to you?

171
00:08:51,871 --> 00:08:54,219
What are you talking about?
I don't have nothing to take.

172
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,755
I'm just saying. I mean,
what if Chris went through your stuff

173
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,080
and took something without asking?

174
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:00,148
Why'd you pick me?
Why didn't you pick Drew or Tonya?

175
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:01,340
Why you acting so suspicious?

176
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,332
Who's suspicious?
It's not me, I'm not suspicious.

177
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:05,040
Well, you sure as hell acting like it.

178
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,041
Eat your food.

179
00:09:12,003 --> 00:09:15,253
<i>Later that night I discovered my father
knew his Playboy was missing.</i>

180
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,254
Chris.

181
00:09:16,412 --> 00:09:17,764
You been in my toolbox?

182
00:09:19,812 --> 00:09:20,812
No. Why?

183
00:09:22,216 --> 00:09:23,526
Uh... nothing.

184
00:09:24,321 --> 00:09:25,850
Those tools will hurt you.

185
00:09:26,068 --> 00:09:28,381
<i>If Miss June knew
how much trouble she was causing,</i>

186
00:09:28,382 --> 00:09:29,793
<i>she wouldn't be smiling.</i>

187
00:09:30,431 --> 00:09:31,960
Drew. Have you seen, uh...

188
00:09:35,517 --> 00:09:38,819
...anything...
unusual around here lately?

189
00:09:39,272 --> 00:09:40,864
Like what, a UFO?

190
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,533
Now, why would a UFO...?

191
00:09:44,683 --> 00:09:45,841
Never mind.

192
00:09:49,045 --> 00:09:50,868
<i>He even started to grill Tonya.</i>

193
00:09:52,152 --> 00:09:54,131
Tonya, baby?

194
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:56,501
Yes, Daddy?

195
00:10:03,591 --> 00:10:04,591
I love you.

196
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:07,292
That's nice.

197
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,698
<i>The vice principal had my magazine,</i>

198
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:11,608
<i>but I had money,</i>

199
00:10:11,609 --> 00:10:14,432
<i>so I figured replacing it
wouldn't be a problem.</i>

200
00:10:14,462 --> 00:10:15,462
$3.50.

201
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:23,330
Now get out of here,
before I call a cop.

202
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,712
For what?
You just robbed me!

203
00:10:24,747 --> 00:10:26,336
- This don't cost $3.50.
- Really?

204
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,168
Then why don't we call your mom
and tell her

205
00:10:28,203 --> 00:10:29,930
how you're trying to buy a Playboy?

206
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:33,460
<i>Hey, Miss June was fine,
but she wasn't worth going to jail.</i>

207
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,541
<i>My last option was to go to Risky.</i>

208
00:10:38,612 --> 00:10:42,259
<i>Since all his stuff was stolen,
I knew he wouldn't call a cop.</i>

209
00:10:42,543 --> 00:10:43,836
<i>He'd get you liquor.</i>

210
00:10:43,862 --> 00:10:44,831
It's for my uncle.

211
00:10:44,832 --> 00:10:46,773
Yeah, don't drink it all at once.

212
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,777
<i>He'd get you cigarettes.</i>

213
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:49,895
It's for my mother.

214
00:10:50,132 --> 00:10:52,190
Yeah, don't smoke them all at once.

215
00:10:52,741 --> 00:10:54,623
<i>He could even get you plutonium.</i>

216
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:55,976
It's for my daughter.

217
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,197
Do not use this all at once.

218
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,110
<i>So I figured I wouldn't have a problem.</i>

219
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:02,515
Playboy magazine?

220
00:11:03,317 --> 00:11:05,571
I ain't selling you
no Playboy magazine.

221
00:11:05,572 --> 00:11:07,170
Boy, what you think this is?

222
00:11:07,171 --> 00:11:08,171
I know your mama.

223
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:11,001
Now how do you think she'd feel
if she knew you were out here trying

224
00:11:11,048 --> 00:11:12,228
to buy a Playboy magazine?

225
00:11:12,252 --> 00:11:14,682
Now if you want to buy beer
or cigarettes, that's one thing.

226
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:15,891
A Playboy magazine?

227
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:17,910
You better keep on moving.

228
00:11:18,683 --> 00:11:20,212
Tell your mama I said hey.

229
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:24,295
I want Wild Cherry to win
in the fifth race at Saratoga.

230
00:11:27,161 --> 00:11:29,056
<i>If I was going to get the Playboy back,</i>

231
00:11:29,057 --> 00:11:30,659
<i>there was only one way to do it.</i>

232
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,315
I've got to steal it
from the vice principal's office.

233
00:11:33,316 --> 00:11:35,082
Dude, wait.
That's burglary.

234
00:11:35,141 --> 00:11:36,107
I know that.

235
00:11:36,142 --> 00:11:39,081
Do you want me to commit burglary
or be a victim of murder?

236
00:11:39,082 --> 00:11:41,031
Okay,
but if we're going outside the law,

237
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:42,412
we've got to do it right.

238
00:12:19,881 --> 00:12:20,891
That's it then.

239
00:12:21,015 --> 00:12:24,202
Every day she goes to lunch in
the teachers' lounge after fifth period.

240
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:25,799
She smokes exactly three cigarettes,

241
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,001
which takes 20 minutes.

242
00:12:27,002 --> 00:12:28,972
All we have to do is get in,
find the magazine,

243
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:30,920
and get out before she gets back.

244
00:12:30,921 --> 00:12:33,070
Except we don't know
where the magazine is.

245
00:12:33,071 --> 00:12:36,725
Fischer told me it was in the bottom
left-hand drawer of her desk.

246
00:12:36,726 --> 00:12:37,731
I hope he's right.

247
00:12:37,732 --> 00:12:39,967
Don't worry, Fischer knows everything.

248
00:12:40,856 --> 00:12:42,150
What if we get caught?

249
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,450
Then we're dead.

250
00:12:43,747 --> 00:12:45,657
I was really hoping
you weren't gonna say that.

251
00:12:45,658 --> 00:12:46,658
Don't worry.

252
00:12:46,802 --> 00:12:48,054
I'll go in and get it.

253
00:12:48,055 --> 00:12:49,055
It's my magazine.

254
00:12:49,521 --> 00:12:50,756
All you have to do is look out

255
00:12:50,757 --> 00:12:53,312
and give me a signal
if you see anybody coming.

256
00:12:53,313 --> 00:12:54,371
I hope this works.

257
00:12:54,617 --> 00:12:55,617
Me, too.

258
00:12:59,031 --> 00:13:00,501
Drew, guess what I found?

259
00:13:01,232 --> 00:13:02,232
What?

260
00:13:04,561 --> 00:13:06,804
What the hell is going on in here?

261
00:13:06,914 --> 00:13:08,710
- Tonya has a spider.
- No, I don't.

262
00:13:08,753 --> 00:13:10,341
Tonya, what are you hiding?

263
00:13:11,411 --> 00:13:12,569
It's just a ring.

264
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,694
Leave Drew alone.

265
00:13:15,265 --> 00:13:17,721
Would you like it if he went around
scaring you all the time?

266
00:13:17,722 --> 00:13:18,780
He can't scare me.

267
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:20,174
I like spiders.

268
00:13:20,272 --> 00:13:22,036
And I ain't scared of nothing.

269
00:13:24,696 --> 00:13:27,441
<i>There was only one thing
Tonya was scared of,</i>

270
00:13:28,143 --> 00:13:29,143
<i>and Drew knew it.</i>

271
00:13:45,516 --> 00:13:46,516
Here.

272
00:13:48,021 --> 00:13:49,021
What's this?

273
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:50,572
My five hundred dol...

274
00:13:51,124 --> 00:13:53,338
I mean our $500.

275
00:13:54,535 --> 00:13:56,358
So why you giving it to me now?

276
00:13:56,383 --> 00:13:58,559
'Cause I don't want to fight anymore.

277
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:00,538
Baby...

278
00:14:01,287 --> 00:14:03,463
I don't want to fight anymore either.

279
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:06,003
But why'd you feel
you had to hide money from me?

280
00:14:06,004 --> 00:14:07,162
I wasn't really hiding it.

281
00:14:07,163 --> 00:14:10,913
I was just keeping it in a safe place
just in case something happened.

282
00:14:10,914 --> 00:14:12,090
Something like what?

283
00:14:12,213 --> 00:14:15,997
Julius, you work hard,
and we barely make ends meet now.

284
00:14:16,283 --> 00:14:18,871
I mean,
God forbid something happens to you.

285
00:14:19,282 --> 00:14:23,647
I mean, you could get hit
by a postal truck or a gas truck.

286
00:14:24,193 --> 00:14:27,418
Get run over by a car,
get high blood pressure,

287
00:14:27,597 --> 00:14:31,672
get the flu,
gout, pneumonia,

288
00:14:32,153 --> 00:14:34,831
scoliosis,
scurvy...

289
00:14:35,064 --> 00:14:36,913
You could fall off a building,

290
00:14:36,914 --> 00:14:38,266
trip off the escalator,

291
00:14:38,514 --> 00:14:41,239
get jumped,
get stabbed,

292
00:14:41,533 --> 00:14:47,188
you could get MS,
ALS, CHP, CCBD.

293
00:14:47,317 --> 00:14:48,444
What's that?

294
00:14:48,538 --> 00:14:51,361
I don't know,
but it sounds like it'll kill you.

295
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:55,740
Oh, baby, I just wanted a cushion
to fall back on, that's all.

296
00:14:56,268 --> 00:14:57,268
Is that all?

297
00:14:57,973 --> 00:14:58,973
Yeah.

298
00:15:00,173 --> 00:15:01,173
Come here.

299
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,660
Here.

300
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:09,209
Take your money,

301
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,510
put it away.

302
00:15:11,264 --> 00:15:12,264
I'm sorry.

303
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:24,982
You go in my shoe again,
I'm going to knock your ass out.

304
00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:41,567
You got that?!

305
00:15:41,603 --> 00:15:44,388
And if I ever catch you scaring
your sister or wearing lipstick again,

306
00:15:44,424 --> 00:15:45,797
we going to have a problem.

307
00:15:45,867 --> 00:15:46,867
You hear me?

308
00:15:47,621 --> 00:15:49,719
All right, baby,
you can go back to bed now.

309
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,014
I changed your sheets.

310
00:15:54,378 --> 00:15:56,180
- You ready?
- Yeah.

311
00:15:58,831 --> 00:15:59,831
Walkie-talkies?

312
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,847
The range is only 100 feet,
so'll stay close.

313
00:16:25,923 --> 00:16:26,944
Man!

314
00:16:32,832 --> 00:16:34,514
Come on.
The hallway's getting empty.

315
00:16:34,515 --> 00:16:36,166
<i>I can't stay out here
much longer.</i>

316
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:38,050
<i>I'm hurrying!
Just keep an eye out!</i>

317
00:16:53,236 --> 00:16:54,236
I've got it.

318
00:16:57,577 --> 00:16:59,942
Abort, abort!
Perimeter not secure!

319
00:17:00,734 --> 00:17:01,856
Oh, no!

320
00:17:03,312 --> 00:17:04,312
Greg?

321
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:05,815
Greg?

322
00:17:05,947 --> 00:17:07,274
Forget it.

323
00:17:12,376 --> 00:17:15,434
Well, I guess we know
to whom this magazine belongs.

324
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:21,004
<i>The last place I wanted my father
to find his Playboy was at my school.</i>

325
00:17:21,184 --> 00:17:22,552
I confiscated this.

326
00:17:24,496 --> 00:17:25,496
Playboy?

327
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:27,496
What does Chris have to do with that?

328
00:17:27,497 --> 00:17:30,566
Somebody brought it to the school,
and I believe it was your son.

329
00:17:31,156 --> 00:17:32,156
Chris?

330
00:17:33,455 --> 00:17:34,455
Is this true?

331
00:17:34,556 --> 00:17:35,556
<i>I wanted to lie,</i>

332
00:17:35,852 --> 00:17:40,494
<i>but my mother always told me if I did,
she'd slap me into another nationality.</i>

333
00:17:44,977 --> 00:17:46,035
Well, I'm waiting.

334
00:17:47,296 --> 00:17:49,627
- Yeah.
- Oh, Lord, have mercy.

335
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,428
Hey, it's just Playboy. I mean,

336
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:54,176
it really doesn't matter.

337
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,364
Boys will be boys.

338
00:17:55,656 --> 00:17:57,303
Is that all you have to say?

339
00:17:57,357 --> 00:17:58,592
"Boys will be boys"?!

340
00:17:59,817 --> 00:18:02,640
Chris, where did you get
a Playboy from, anyway?

341
00:18:03,668 --> 00:18:04,665
<i>That look means,</i>

342
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,027
<i>"Boy, I know I've never
asked you to lie,</i>

343
00:18:07,028 --> 00:18:10,439
<i>but please don't tell your mother
that that's my Playboy."</i>

344
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:13,436
I found it?

345
00:18:15,986 --> 00:18:18,843
Usually, I would suspend you
for this sort of behavior,

346
00:18:18,892 --> 00:18:21,168
but I think this is best
handled by the parents.

347
00:18:21,215 --> 00:18:24,170
And you best believe
we're going to handle it, right, Julius?

348
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:25,935
Yeah, we going to handle this.

349
00:18:26,668 --> 00:18:28,893
- I'll take that.
- What you going to do with it?

350
00:18:28,951 --> 00:18:31,134
<i>Here's what he really wanted to do.</i>

351
00:18:39,441 --> 00:18:40,558
I'll dispose of it.

352
00:18:41,512 --> 00:18:42,512
Yeah.

353
00:18:43,061 --> 00:18:45,002
Yeah, that's, that's a good idea.

354
00:18:45,216 --> 00:18:46,274
Disposing is good.

355
00:18:48,388 --> 00:18:49,505
Come out here, boy.

356
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,847
<i>One of the ways I always tried
to avoid getting beatings</i>

357
00:18:52,848 --> 00:18:54,495
<i>was pretending to be asleep.</i>

358
00:18:56,254 --> 00:18:58,477
Get up, boy.
You ain't fooling nobody.

359
00:18:59,403 --> 00:19:01,624
I'm sorry I took your magazine, Dad.

360
00:19:04,222 --> 00:19:06,917
You shouldn't take
other people's things, Chris.

361
00:19:06,918 --> 00:19:08,388
That's why I put it away.

362
00:19:08,488 --> 00:19:11,077
But more than that,
you're too young for that kind of stuff.

363
00:19:11,078 --> 00:19:12,783
Yeah, but it's just pictures.

364
00:19:12,827 --> 00:19:15,608
Look how much trouble
"just pictures" caused you.

365
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:16,687
You got chased by a mob,

366
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:19,243
your mama's mad at you
and you almost got kicked out of school.

367
00:19:19,267 --> 00:19:21,886
<i>That's when I discovered that
even if they're made of paper,</i>

368
00:19:21,887 --> 00:19:24,906
<i>the wrong kind of woman
can really mess up your life.</i>

369
00:19:24,907 --> 00:19:27,259
Look,
I know you're interested in girls,

370
00:19:27,757 --> 00:19:30,065
but there's a lot for you
to learn first.

371
00:19:30,066 --> 00:19:32,830
If you never need anything,
you can talk to me.

372
00:19:32,868 --> 00:19:34,456
But don't go in my toolbox.

373
00:19:34,468 --> 00:19:38,071
<i>After that, my father started
hiding things in his fish tackle box.</i>

374
00:19:38,072 --> 00:19:40,177
<i>I never told him
I found it the next day.</i>

375
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:41,178
I promise.

376
00:19:41,227 --> 00:19:43,076
Things didn't turn out that bad, though.

377
00:19:43,077 --> 00:19:45,696
I made $28 off that Playboy.

378
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:49,466
My magazine, my money.

379
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,221
Here, you can keep that.
