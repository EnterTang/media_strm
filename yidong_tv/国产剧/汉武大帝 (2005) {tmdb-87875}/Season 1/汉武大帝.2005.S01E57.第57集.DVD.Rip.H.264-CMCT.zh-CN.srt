3
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,155
This is Bandit One.
I'm easing her up.
这里是l37号开始脱离路面

4
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,733
- Are we transmitting yet?
- Not yet.
开始发送信号了吗？
还没有

5
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,270
Rodgers, Orin, how's the perimeter?
罗杰斯、奥伦，情况如何？

6
00:01:48,476 --> 00:01:49,909
It's clear.
咱们走

7
00:01:56,017 --> 00:01:58,417
Bandit One receiving signal.
Approaching target vector.
目标区域有信号接近

8
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:06,356
Transmitting to base now, sir.
开始对基地传送，长官，
这地区安全了

9
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:08,859
- The place is secure.
- Good. Now we keep it that way.
好，继续努力

10
00:02:09,063 --> 00:02:11,224
- Take the left flank, Hargs.
- Sir.
保持线路畅通
是，长官

11
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:29,649
Was that him?
那里面是什么？

12
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:31,648
I don't know. Let's check it out.
我不知道，咱们去看看

13
00:02:54,876 --> 00:02:57,106
- Talk to me.
- We got the bogey on the run, sir.
向我回报
！我们被伏击了，长官

14
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:58,801
Which way?
哪里来的？

15
00:02:59,247 --> 00:03:00,771
Rodgers, which way?
罗杰斯，在哪边？

16
00:03:00,982 --> 00:03:03,883
- Which way, Rodgers?
- Cannot identify, sir.
不能确认，长官

17
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:07,615
Is he jamming our frequency?
难道他们在干扰我们的频率吗？
看来是的，长官

18
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:10,513
- Looks like it, sir.
- You're supposed to be jamming his.
应该是你干扰他们的频率？

19
00:03:11,726 --> 00:03:14,490
This is Bandit One,
homing in on target vicinity.
这里是空中一号，
请帮助我确认目标精确地点

20
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:17,021
Hightop. Hightop!
躲起来，躲起来

21
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:24,102
I want you to hold this position.
Nobody gets in. You got that?
我要你死守这个位置
不许任何人进来

22
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:25,863
Got it, sir.
明白吗？
是，长官

23
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:38,512
Closing to zero mark center.
接近目标了

24
00:03:58,206 --> 00:03:59,901
Still on approach vector.

25
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,873
Sir, sir, he's here.
The Painter's here, sir!
长官，他们在这里长官！
靠！

26
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,635
Damn!
准备摧毁目标

27
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:14,782
Over target signal.
目标锁定

28
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:27,225
Target is lit. I'm going in.
目标锁定，去吧

29
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,936
Got it. Locking on. Flares away.
好了，发射完毕

30
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:01,733
Too easy, Naish.
发射！

31
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,233
Way too easy.
太容易了，太容易得手了

32
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,607
Damn it.
妈的
训练结束

33
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:09,674
Training mission is over,
and the Painter does it again.
成功摧毁目标

34
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:12,175
Returning to base now.
我们现在返回基地

35
00:07:25,246 --> 00:07:26,611
What are you doing here?
你在这里干什么呢

36
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:50,735
Wait here. Be quiet.
等着，别出声

37
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:08,115
Where's your mommy
and daddy, huh?
你爸爸妈妈呢？

38
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:11,486
Okay, come on.
好吧，走吧

39
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,666
Drive.
走吧

40
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:59,865
Thank you for organizing this
in such short notice, everyone.
感谢大家这么仓促前来

41
00:09:00,074 --> 00:09:02,907
As I'm sure you can appreciate,
we've had a serious situation...
不过我相信你们一定能够理解的

42
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,806
...come up over the last 12 hours
in southern Russia...
因为在过去的十二小时内
发生了一些非常严重的事情

43
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:08,675
...which requires
our immediate attention.
在俄罗斯南部需要我们关注

44
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:13,553
General lgor Zaysan...
伊冈．塞辛将军一个强硬人物

45
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:18,191
...an iron fist from the Brezhnev days,
Afghanistan, the southern states.
活动在阿富汗南部区域

46
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:22,054
Over the last few years
he resurfaced in Chechnya.
过去几年中他在车臣当预备役

47
00:09:22,263 --> 00:09:24,857
He made good use of the rebels,
considering he's a Russian.
充分利用
那里的叛军和俄罗斯的敌对关系

48
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,226
He put together a new army,
new weapons.
招兵买马

49
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:30,167
And now it seems,
quite possibly, a nuke.
现在看来很可能掌握核子武器

50
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:08,236
Yesterday, he led a band
of his rebels across the Terek River...
昨天他带领一支叛军部队
越过塔瑞克河

51
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:12,105

the Kamshev nuclear plant.
占领了卡姆凡利夫的核子工厂

52
00:10:12,313 --> 00:10:14,440
Now, three of the four reactors...
那里四个反应炉

53
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:16,309
...at Kamshev have been
decommissioned.
其中的三个已经停运

54
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:20,650
The fuel rods have been removed
from the fourth reactor...
第四个反应炉的燃料棒也被清除了
但是它却可能重新运作

55
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:25,086
...but it is capable of going online
if it is re-cored.
如果有人将它运作的话

56
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:43,173
This would appear to be
a Russian problem, Mr. Tensor.
这看起来是俄罗斯的问题

57
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:46,244
Please, general,
let us make no mistake.
将军，请不要误会

58
00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:48,039
Gentlemen...

...lgor Zaysan
is a very dangerous man.

60
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,413
We have been tracking him
for a number of years.
我们追踪了他好多年了

61
00:10:55,623 --> 00:11:00,151
His hatred for the Kremlin
has become a complete obsession.
他对克里姆林宫的仇恨
已经成了一种强迫焦虑症

62
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:11,995
What's this?
这些人是谁，干嘛去？

63
00:11:12,206 --> 00:11:14,834
- What are you doing with them?
- They are prisoners.
他们是囚犯

64
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:18,576
They surrendered when we moved
into the plant.
他们是看守工厂的

65
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:20,974
Where are you taking them?
你带他们去哪里？

66
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,944
Exactly my point.
执行我的计划

67
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:34,759
If he is capable
of re-coring this reactor...
如果他能够把这反应炉重新运作…

68
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:37,328
...he is capable of detonating it.
…他有这个能力

69
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:43,931
That is to say, potentially
100,000 deaths in an instant.
那片刻间就可能有十万人死亡

70
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,568
And a few hundred thousand more
when the winds...
当风吹过整个地区，
将会有数百万或更多的人死去

71
00:11:46,774 --> 00:11:51,370
...send the fallout over an area
the size of Texas.
相当于得克萨斯州的人口数了

72
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,808
We have proof
he's capable of all this?
我们对于那些推测有证据吗？
阿曼达，请显示影像

73
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:56,710
Amanda, pull up the Flintov picture.
阿曼达，请显示影像

74
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:02,146
This surveillance photograph
was taken in North Korea.
这张照片是在北韩拍到的

75
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:05,256
The Asian is John Lee Kim.
这个亚洲人是张立金

76
00:12:05,693 --> 00:12:09,561
He's the ace of hearts in our deck
of most-wanted arms dealers.
是我们最想逮捕到的军火贩子

77
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:12,425
The man with him is Andre Flintov...
和他在一起的男人
是安卓恩．弗理塔夫

78
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:15,764
...Zaysan's second in command.
他是塞辛的副手

79
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:21,168
Now, it seems that Flintov
has plutonium on his shopping list.
好像弗理塔夫
也在金的客户名单上

80
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,536
What has Uncle Kim got for sale?
他有什么好卖的？

81
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:28,806
Fuel rods from a failed
North Korean reactor.
燃料棒，
来自北韩一度废弃的核反应炉

00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:34,316
We have to destroy
the Kamshev plant...
我们必须摧毁
卡姆凡利夫的核子工厂

83
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,887
...before Zaysan re-cores it.
在塞辛重新启动它之前

84
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:03,679
- Is the package moving?
- Yes.
包裹在移动中吗？   是

85
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:06,109
Will they know what's in it?
那里面是什么东西？

86
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,083
The Americans will have
their intelligence, and they'll act on it.
美国人一定会有
他们的间谍来救他们

87
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,948
You'll see.
解决掉

88
00:13:23,437 --> 00:13:26,565
We are not in the business
of doing Russia's dirty work.
我们没工夫理俄罗斯的麻烦事

89
00:13:26,774 --> 00:13:29,538
It's not just the Russians,
there are seven scientists...
这不仅是俄罗斯的麻烦
有民间的七个科学家在那里工作

90
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:31,836
...from the private sector
working at Kamshev...
其中四个是美国人

91
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:34,946
...four of whom are Americans.
- How the hell did they get there?
他们怎么到那里去的

92
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:37,617
The Russians hired them
to help decommission the plant.
俄罗斯人雇用他们
去瓦解工厂的运作

93
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:39,713
- Are they still alive?
- We're not sure.
他们还活着吗？  不确定

94
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,047
One of them, Arthur Moffit...
其中一个叫“阿瑟马福特”的

95
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:45,157
...has stayed in contact
with Moscow by cell phone.
通过手机与莫斯科保持联系

96
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:49,261
Latest report suggests he's managed
to stay hidden from Zaysan's troops.
最近的报告显示
他好像想办法逃过了塞辛的军队

97
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:51,988
So let me get the bottom line here.
那我来说明白点

98
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:54,224
We've got a nuclear reactor
to take out...
我们要摧毁一个核子反应炉，
拯救人质

99
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:57,164
...hostages to rescue,
and it's all on us.
而又全靠我们自己

100
00:13:57,538 --> 00:14:00,996
Unfortunately, the Russians
have lost control on this one.
很不幸
俄罗斯对此事已经失去了控制

101
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,675
As you know, Mr. Secretary...
如你所知，秘书长先生

102
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:06,004
...they are not averse
to our support in this.
他们也不反对
我们在此事件上的支持

103
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:08,276
What do you propose?
你有什么建议？

104
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:13,847
An air strike.
空中轰炸

105
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:15,919
We level the place.
那整个区域，人质…

106
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:17,852
- The hostages...
- Four or five lives...
四五条人命相比

107
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:21,118
...against 100,000. I can accept that.
上百人命还是值得牺牲的

108
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:24,456
General, we're not able to do
a large-scale bombing here.
将军，我们不能进行大规模空袭

109
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:27,498
- How come?
- The area is too contaminated.
为什么？
那个区域的核污染太过严重

110
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,932
Unless we do a precise air strike,
we risk sending huge clouds...
除非能精确打中目标，否则…

111
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:33,038
...of radioactive dust
into the nearby town.
就有向附近村镇
扩散大量放射性灰尘的危险

112
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:36,601
Well, from what I know,
these reactors aren't easy to take out.
据我了解这些反应炉
是很难摧毁的

113
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,402
We need to target its weak spot.
我们需要花几个星
期时间来讨论才行

114
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:40,341
What we need is a painter.
我们需要的是一个
目标人物（目标定位的人）

115
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:45,645
- Send in a painter with a Ranger team.
- I agree.
-派出一个目标人物和一队突击队
-我同意

116
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:49,179
They could secure the hostages
and choose a precise target.
他们可以拯救人质
并确定精确空袭地点

117
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,482
It could get real difficult over there.
在那里情况可能很因难

118
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:55,321
I have to persuade the president
that this plan could work.
我必须说服总统接受这个计划

119
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:57,893
Do we have any guys
with real combat experience?
我们是否有一个，
具有战斗经验的人选？

120
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,890
No, we need someone
who's been through this before.
我们需要
一个执行过类似任务的人

121
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:04,827
This man can do it.
这个人可以做得到

122
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,300
Well, I can't see it like that.
德国．维斯巴登

123
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:38,767
I just can't see
how you'd look at it any other way.
我就是无法理解
那还能怎么想呢

124
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:42,237
- We had our asses kicked.
- Oh, fuck that.
我们输了就是输了，去你的

125
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,933
One man don't make a team.
一个人不足为惧

126
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:47,438
No, he ain't nothing
without his high-tech shit.
他要是没有那些高科技支持，
就什么都不是

127
00:15:47,648 --> 00:15:49,741
Yeah? I'd like to see you
say that to his face.
是吗，你敢当着他的面说吗？

128
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,113
Oh, fuck you.
I say what I want to who I want.
去你的，我想说什么都行

129
00:15:54,922 --> 00:15:56,321
Even the captain?
哪怕跟队长说？

130
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,252
Yeah.
对

131
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,982
See, we're a team.
我们是一个团队

132
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:02,093
We don't hold our piss,
even for captain.
我们有什么事不会瞒着队长

133
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:07,562
Well, all I know is,
he beat every one of us.
我所知道的
就是他打败我们所有人

134
00:16:07,768 --> 00:16:09,963
That's gotta count for something.
那总不能不算数吧

135
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:21,012
- What's up, captain?
- We gotta go.
-什么事，队长？
-该走了

136
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:24,274
We got two suits from D.C. Flying in
to give us our mission.
华盛顿有飞机来接我们过去

137
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:26,348
- What, tonight?
- Yeah.
-今晚？
-对

138
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:28,480
Let's go.
走吧

139
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:41,932
We got a mission.
我们有任务了

140
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,335
They're asking for you.
他们要你去

141
00:17:01,555 --> 00:17:03,147
This is the USS Oakla.
美国海军奥卡拉号．地中海

142
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:06,019
We're in position
and conducting maneuvers.
这里是美国海军奥卡拉号
我们己就位

143
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:09,559
Will advise
upon operation commencement.
等待进一步命令

144
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,355
These just came in
from our agent in Dagestan.
这是我们在达吉斯坦的情报人员
传送过来的

145
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:13,356
Anshan lmports,
one of John Lee Kim's companies.
他们通过张立金的公司进口武器

146
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:20,262
The shipment's
from Namp'o, North Korea?
货是从北韩的南浦港运出的？

147
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,562
- Do we know what it is?
- Certainly big enough for fuel rods.
是什么呢？
就燃料棒来说当然够大了

148
00:18:36,016 --> 00:18:38,484
The Russians have promised
to keep an eye on its movement.
俄罗斯答应
监视他们在那里的行动

149
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:41,920
And to stop it
once the situation's stabilized.
传输结束，他们说是如此

150
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,989
We better have one of our guys
keep an eye on it too.
不过我们最好也有一个人
盯着点比较放心

151
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:48,152
It's imperative we take out
that last reactor...
在这个货柜到那里之前
我们就要把最后的反应炉拿下

152
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:50,693
...before this container gets there.
太神奇了
就是老维克多也没机会

153
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:54,029
It's amazing.
但愿他保佑
我们这次能干得漂亮点

154
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:57,601
Even old Viktor lvanov's
given us his blessing.
俄罗斯，克里姆林宫

155
00:19:15,055 --> 00:19:16,283
Come in.
进来

156
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:23,962
- Excuse me, Mr. Ivanov.
- Yes, Beslan?
打扰一下，伊万诺夫先生

157
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:26,026
The prime minister is ready for us.
什么事？
总理准备好见我们了

158
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:27,931
Okay.
好的

159
00:19:52,726 --> 00:19:55,354
Amanda, Jonathan,
good to see you.
-乔纳森
-你好

160
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:57,826
- You too, major.
- This is Captain Naish.
这位是纳许队长

161
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:00,055
He leads the Ranger team
we're sending in.
他带领我们这次出击的突击队

162
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:02,997
- Good to meet you, captain.
- I know you've been fully briefed.
-很高兴见到你，队长
-我知道你一定准备充分

163
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:06,138
So you know what you're up against,
I thought you better hear this.
不过为了让你进一步了解
还是跟你说明白

164
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:08,466
It might prove critical.
Can you run that for us?
我总是要求比较苛刻
能播放一下这个吗，少校？

165
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:10,199
Sure. Sergeant.
中士！

166
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:24,480
The rebels came in
and found the others, about five.
叛军就要来了

167
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:26,682
Me and Valentina are still
in the hospital.
很快就会找到我们了

168
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:30,385
You've got to get us out of here.
Please, get us out of here.
你们一定要把我们放出去，求你们救我们出去

169
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:32,121
They're back.
再见了

170
00:20:32,866 --> 00:20:35,334
That's the voice of Arthur Moffit...
这是阿瑟马福特的声音

171
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:38,297
...the lead scientist
on the decommissioning team.
解除核工厂运作
的科学家小组成员之―

172
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:41,303
- How do you know if he's still alive?
- We don't.
-怎么知道他是否还活着？
-不知道

173
00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:44,409
The rebels haven't even acknowledged
that they've taken hostages.
叛军根本没有声明他们有人质

174
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:47,603
The fact is,
we haven't even made contact.
事实上，
我们根本没有和他们联络过

175
00:20:47,948 --> 00:20:50,508
And you think
they're gonna re-core this reactor?
然后你们认为
他们会重新启动那个反应炉

176
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:53,184
So far, everything points
in that direction.
目前为止我们认为
事情正往那个方向发展

177
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:55,249
Good luck, captain.
祝你好运，队长

178
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:57,346
Gentlemen.
主要目标是什么？

179
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:14,134
What's my primary target,
the hostages or the reactor?
解救人质还是核子工厂？

180
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,140
Both.
两个都是

181
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,969
If there's a choice,
which one takes priority?
如果两者冲突哪一个优先呢？

182
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:24,377
What are my orders, ma'am?
我的命令是什么？

183
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:26,417
The reactor.
核子反应炉

184
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:51,267
Is that it? You wanna say
anything more to me?
就那些话吗？
没什么话要对我说的吗？

185
00:21:51,878 --> 00:21:53,175
The briefing's over.
询问结束，任务明确了

186
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,347
Damn it, you can talk to me.
见鬼，你可以和我随便谈话的

187
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:57,981
I'm still here for you.
我还是一直在支持你的

188
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:01,921
Look, if you want a psych evaluation,
you can read the file.
因为关系暖昧而接受精神测试
还不如被开除走人

189
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:03,849
You wrote it.
那是你写的

190
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:07,824
It's still there,
the same look in your eyes.
还是那样，
你眼睛里还是那种表情

191
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:11,927
What look would that be,
the one you saw in the inquiry?
那个表情是什么意思？
是你在质询的时候看见的？

192
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:14,356
That's not fair.
这不公平

193
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:17,294
What do you want from me, Amanda,
a thank-you?
阿曼达，你想从我这里得到什么
谢谢你

194
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:19,001
Okay, thank you.
好！

195
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:21,070
You cleaned my record.
谢谢你为我填写报告，不过…

196
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:23,840
Means nothing to those people
buried in the ground.
这和那些长眠地下的人
已经毫无关系了

197
00:22:24,277 --> 00:22:26,108
It wasn't your fault.
那不是你的错

198
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,510
I took the order. I lit the target.
我执行了命令，我指示的目标

199
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:32,107
That mission was over years ago.
那个任务已经结束很多年了

200
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:35,015
Those deaths are in the past.
Leave them behind.
死者己矣，忘了他们吧

201
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:41,118
That's a good idea.
好主意

202
00:22:55,175 --> 00:22:57,075
Prime minister, hello.
总理阁下，你好

203
00:22:57,277 --> 00:22:58,744
Have you heard
from the Americans?
你收到美国人的消息了吗？

204
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:00,970
They want a rescue
and a preemptive air strike.
他们要用空中轰炸并拯救人质

205
00:23:01,181 --> 00:23:03,911
- They say it is in our best interests.
- Of course they would.
-他们说这是对我们最有利的方法了
-当然会这么说

206
00:23:04,117 --> 00:23:08,019
Their newfound obsession
has been exhilarating for them.
他们找到新的目标正高兴不己呢

207
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:10,052
They are asking for us to counter
with a ground attack.
他们要求我们地面协助进攻

208
00:23:10,457 --> 00:23:13,290
We can't make that promise.
我们不能答应

209
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:15,290
Then lie.
对

210
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:17,486
Let them believe they're in charge.
让他们自己掌握好了

211
00:23:17,831 --> 00:23:21,426
The blame rests on their shoulders.
到时出了事也是他们负责

212
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:24,194
Has Zaysan found...
塞辛找到了他要找的东西吗

213
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:28,640
...what he's looking for?
- It's on its way to him as we speak.
正按计划，在送去给他的路上

214
00:23:28,842 --> 00:23:32,005
We must let the Americans
take out the reactor.
我们一定要
让美国人自己砸自己的脚

215
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:34,609
I'll tell the president.
我会告诉总统的

216
00:23:39,152 --> 00:23:41,382
That reactor's got
reinforced concrete.
那个反应炉有加强水泥壁

217
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:43,385
Sure there's a good spot
to take it out?
你确定那是一个好进入地点吗？

218
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,989
I'll find one.
我会找一个合适的地方的

219
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:48,456
The spec shows a narrow target area
for it to implode.
这个仪器能给空中出击
确定精确位置

220
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:51,093
It's all about minimal damage
on this op.
关键是对这个物体的打击降到最低

221
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:54,858
We go in, locate the hostages,
paint the target...
我们进去，确定人质地点

222
00:23:55,068 --> 00:23:57,332
...and then get out
before anyone knows we're there.
带走目标，马上安静的撤出

223
00:23:57,537 --> 00:23:58,799
Any questions?
有问题吗？   是

224
00:23:59,005 --> 00:24:01,974
Yeah. Well, how close on our ass
is the air strike?
空军攻击多久会到？

225
00:24:02,175 --> 00:24:05,440
They'll be right on our ass.
That's why we gotta make it quick.
方位确定后他们紧跟着就到
所以我们动作一定要快

226
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:07,806
Well, how hot is it
around the reactor site?
叛军如果离得很近怎么办？

227
00:24:08,014 --> 00:24:11,609
A small company of Zaysan's loyalists
are protecting his ass there.
只有小部分塞辛的忠实部下
在那里防守

228
00:24:12,018 --> 00:24:15,419
The rest of the rebel troops
are across the river, 20 miles south.
其他叛军在河对岸南面2O英里处

229
00:24:15,855 --> 00:24:20,792
Captain, this being
a stealth op and all...
队长？这次任务这么危险

230
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,960
...we gotta leave Orin behind.
我们得把伯恩留下

231
00:24:23,163 --> 00:24:25,563
You can see his fat ass a mile away.
因为你在一英里之外
都可以看到他的大屁股

232
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:28,632
Go blow yourself, asshole.
你这个混蛋的屁股才那么大

233
00:24:30,203 --> 00:24:32,899
Quit it. Let's pack and roll, people.
好了，咱们收拾上路吧  伙计们

234
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:04,698
- Jacks here.
- What is happening now?
-我是杰克斯
-现在发生什么事？

235
00:25:04,904 --> 00:25:06,098
We're moving forward.
我们开始行动了

236
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,200
The team's on its way.
已经派出突击小组去了

237
00:25:08,408 --> 00:25:10,308
We have a man
shadowing the container.
我们另外有一个人在监视货柜车

238
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,375
Our forces are ready to intercept it.
我们的部队已经准备好行动了

239
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:15,503
Have them hold off
until the plant is secured...
让他们等到工厂
确保安全之后再行动

240
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,313
...or those hostages
are as good as dead.
否则这些人质就死定了

241
00:25:31,331 --> 00:25:34,994
Hey, Hargs.
Man, I did some checking on him.
嘿，哈克斯，我可以与你核对一下吗？

242
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:37,226
Total malfunction in Bosnia.
它可不能乱出错

243
00:25:38,171 --> 00:25:40,139
He painted the wrong target.
如果它把我们定位的目标搞错了

244
00:25:40,406 --> 00:25:42,840
We're talking
major collateral damage.
后果不堪设想

245
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:05,258
Yo, what's your name?
What do we call you?
你叫什么名字？
我们怎么称呼你？

246
00:26:06,466 --> 00:26:07,899
Yeah.
对啊！

247
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:09,431
What's your name, dude?
你叫什么，伙计？

248
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:13,332
If it comes to having to save your ass,
I wanna know your name.
如果我们连你的名字都不知道
到时怎么救你呢？

249
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:20,036
Worry about saving your ass,
I'll worry about saving mine.
如果我是你们的话，
还是先担心怎么救自己吧

250
00:26:21,648 --> 00:26:23,616
All right, people, let's roll.
好了，准备跳伞

251
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:16,535
We're losing the signal.
我们失去他们的信号

252
00:27:16,736 --> 00:27:18,601
Must be on a real ride.
一定是风太大了

253
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:21,433
Those are 70-mile-an-hour
wind gusts.
他们的下降速度有7o英里时速呢

254
00:27:21,908 --> 00:27:24,240
Is there a problem, major?
有问题吗，少校？

255
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:26,176
I hope not.
希望没有

256
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,212
Ready to deploy chutes on my mark.
听我命令

257
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:37,980
Mark.
打开降落伞

258
00:27:47,367 --> 00:27:49,301
Chutes open.
降落伞打开了

259
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:51,265
Off the target.
达到目的地

260
00:27:52,639 --> 00:27:55,472
Well, there's nothing more we can do
to help them now.
现在我们帮不了他们了

261
00:27:56,142 --> 00:27:58,133
They're on their own up there.
他们全靠自己了

262
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:23,430
Painter.
伙计们？

263
00:28:23,636 --> 00:28:24,830
Hargs.
哈克斯？

264
00:28:27,874 --> 00:28:29,364
I took a local reading, sir.
看一下读数，长官

265
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:30,872
Their comsets are down.
他们都下来了

266
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:34,510
Well, they were due east of us.
So let's pack and go.
我们每个人的仪表都要检视一次

267
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:16,045
Sir.
好了，走吧

268
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:25,287
This way.
这边

269
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,297
- Morning, Mr. Secretary.
- Morning, John.
早安，秘书长先生
早安，约翰

270
00:29:33,506 --> 00:29:35,838
We have a green light, sir.
The team's on the ground.
我们目前一切顺利
他们到达地面了

271
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:37,600
When will the target be lit?
目标什么时候能被定位？

272
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,277
Two hours, at most.
最多两个小时

273
00:29:39,512 --> 00:29:42,242
One of our satellites will pick up
the Painter's signal.
我们的一个卫星
会接收“定位人”的信号

274
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:45,906
We have an F-14 standing by
off a carrier in the Gulf.
我们有一架F―l4战斗机
在海湾的航空母舰上

275
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:47,483
They're waiting for a go-ahead.
他们在等待命令出动

276
00:29:47,687 --> 00:29:49,484
And the Russians
have coordinated...
俄罗斯方面协助地面行动

277
00:29:49,689 --> 00:29:52,021
...a offensive move to coincide
with the strike.
随时给我消息监控一切任务发展

278
00:29:52,225 --> 00:29:54,250
Keep me informed,
and keep everything on track.
是，先生

279
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,690
- Yes, sir, we certainly will.
- Good luck.
祝好运
谢谢你，先生

280
00:29:56,896 --> 00:29:58,727
Thank you, sir. Bye-bye.
再见

281
00:30:46,479 --> 00:30:48,379
Captain Jack Stevens,
skipper of the Oakla.
我是杰克斯.蒂文
奥克拉号的船长

282
00:30:48,581 --> 00:30:50,344
- Lt. Randall, sir.
- Lt. Carter, sir.
-我是雷纳德中尉，长官
-我是科纳中尉，长官

283
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:53,776
Colonel Reynolds gave me
some details about your mission.
科纳，雷纳德，
我对你们的任务有所了解

284
00:30:53,986 --> 00:30:55,749
In fact, too few.
你们两个其实都很杰出

285
00:30:55,955 --> 00:30:57,820
I was impressed
with your flight record...
你们的飞行记录，我很欣赏

286
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:02,117
...particularly on the F-14 Tomcat.
I do see that you're carrier-qualified.
尤其是在F―l4战斗机的飞行任务表现出色
你们两个的素质确实很适合这次任务

287
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:05,388
But what I don't see is why
a Navy pilot can't fly this mission.
但是我不明白的是为什么
海军的飞行员不能执行这次飞行任务

288
00:31:05,598 --> 00:31:08,465
The way we see this little get-to,
it's an Army problem.
我们的看法是这是陆军的问题

289
00:31:08,668 --> 00:31:10,693
So the Army ought to be the one
to clean it up.
所以应由我们自己解决

290
00:31:10,903 --> 00:31:14,168
- Not good enough, lieutenant.
- The dispatch from Col. Reynolds...
这个答案不够好，中尉

291
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:17,308
...explains the parameters
of this operation, the need for secrecy.
这是上面的命令
不需要向我们特别解释

292
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,740
I don't give a damn
about dispatch, lieutenant.
我才不管是什么任务分配呢

293
00:31:19,946 --> 00:31:22,210
If I'm gonna entrust my airplane
to an Army pilot...
我要把心爱的战机
借给陆军飞行员

294
00:31:22,415 --> 00:31:25,213
...and let him fly in harm's way,
then by God, I wanna know why.
任由他们就那么开走
看在上帝的份上，我想知道为什么？

295
00:31:25,418 --> 00:31:26,783
Yes, sir.
是，长官

296
00:31:26,986 --> 00:31:29,614
I know the terrain,
I know the ground crew.
我了解那个梦想，
我了解地面部队

297
00:31:29,822 --> 00:31:32,188
You could let a naval aviator
fly this operation...
你可以让一个海军飞行员
来执行这次任务

298
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:34,356
...but the Army needs me.
但是陆军需要我

299
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:40,090
- Fair enough, lieutenant.
- Roger that, sir.
很好，中尉很高兴你这么说，
长官

300
00:32:12,565 --> 00:32:14,590
This looks like the hospital.
数据处理，．目标区域
这是关押人质的地方

301
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,394
The reactor's less than a mile away.
反应炉在一英里之内了

302
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:36,346
Go. Go.
上，上

303
00:32:45,064 --> 00:32:47,692
Moffit says he was hiding
in the hospital.
探测人质方位

304
00:32:57,076 --> 00:32:58,475
He's here.
在这里

305
00:32:59,178 --> 00:33:00,770
Got it going again for you, sir.
附近暂时无人，长官

306
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,312
- Great.
- But Harg's set's dead.
-很好.
-是哈克斯说的

307
00:33:03,516 --> 00:33:05,450
- Damn.
- What do we do now?
-泰勒.
-我们现在怎么做？

308
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:07,016
This way. This way.
这边，这边

309
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:09,519
Go. Go with them.
去，和他一起去

310
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,954
Hargs, stay close to the Painter.
哈克斯，和“定位人”保持近距离

311
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:19,654
Sir.
是，长官

312
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:40,878
Rodgers, Orin, upstairs.
罗杰斯，沃伦，去楼上

313
00:33:41,253 --> 00:33:43,244
Hightop, cover the lobby.
海特，到大厅去

314
00:33:43,456 --> 00:33:44,684
I got the morgue.
我去查其他通道

315
00:33:45,191 --> 00:33:47,591
How come that don't surprise me?
那家伙还真让我吃惊

316
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,335
Clear up here.
这里安全

317
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:14,777
Your nerves shaky?
这里让你感觉不安？

318
00:35:16,015 --> 00:35:18,643
Yeah, a little.
对，是的

319
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:22,316
Good.
Means your instincts are turned on.
很好，那就是你的本能被唤醒了

320
00:35:41,941 --> 00:35:44,239
- I found them.
- Please don't hurt us.
-我找到他们了
-请不要伤害我们

321
00:35:44,677 --> 00:35:46,338
Please don't hurt us.
请不要伤害我们

322
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:49,480
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
Come with me. Go on, let's go.
没人会伤害你们的
安静跟我们走

323
00:35:49,682 --> 00:35:52,742
Go, go, go. This way.
这边走

324
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:55,077
Go.
快走！

325
00:36:01,794 --> 00:36:05,594
We got bogeys.
Three of them, coming right at me.
我们碰到障碍了
他们一起往我这里来

326
00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:11,803
- Who's she?
- Valentina Bakoff, my coworker.
-她是谁？
-我的助手

327
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:13,437
- Where are the others?
- We don't know.
-其他人呢？
-我们不知道

328
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:16,437
There were seven of us working here
when the soldiers came.
士兵进来的时候
我们在不同的区域工作

329
00:36:16,642 --> 00:36:18,405
I think they were
in the breeder reactor.
我想他们在最新的反应炉那里

330
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:20,704
- Where were you?
- Working in the cooling tower...
那你当时在哪里？

331
00:36:20,913 --> 00:36:22,540
...with her.
- How did you get there?
-我和她在了望塔工作
-你怎么到刚才那地方去的？

332
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:26,013
There's underground pipe ways
that connect to the reactors.
有地下管道系统连接这些反应炉

333
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:29,213
When we got here, soldiers were
wrecking the medical center.
我们到的时候
那些士兵占领了医疗中心

334
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:32,547
- And we hid.
- Who's the woman in the morgue?
-我们可以走了吗？
-地下通道那里的女人是谁？

335
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:34,758
- What woman?
- One with the hole in the head.
什么女人？那个扎辫子的女人

336
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,951

我们不知道，怎么从管子里通过

337
00:36:37,163 --> 00:36:38,357
Through the morgue.
从地下通道那里的入口下去

338
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,062
Hightop, pull back.
海因塔，撤退

339

She worked with us.
她和我们一起工作

341
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:20,599
Come on.

00:37:41,126 --> 00:37:42,787
Okay, it's clear.
好，没有发现状况

343
00:37:42,995 --> 00:37:45,190
- Which way?

Check upstairs.

but a stinking woman.

什么也没有

346
00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:45,781
Let's go see Flintov.
咱们去弗林托夫那里吧

347
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:53,794
This is it.
就是这里

348
00:38:59,138 --> 00:39:01,402
This is the entrance
to reactor number three?
-这是去三号反应炉的入口

349

- You sure?

Go.
上去

Orin, Hightop, stay with the civilians.
沃伦，躲起来，和那些人质一起

352
00:40:33,966 --> 00:40:35,263
Son of a bitch.
混蛋

353
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:50,540
Shit, that makes seven.
该死的！真没人性

354
00:41:01,193 --> 00:41:02,558
We're moving out.
我们该撤退了

355
00:41:02,761 --> 00:41:04,251
We can't just leave them here.
不能就这么把他们留在这里

356
00:41:04,897 --> 00:41:06,831
He's right, captain.
These are Americans.
他说得对，队长他们都是美国人

357
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:10,433
I don't like it either, but we gotta
make evac. That's five klicks away.
我也不喜欢这样，但是没有选择

358
00:41:10,636 --> 00:41:13,503
We got no time
to be carrying bodies.
我们时间不多了

359
00:41:21,046 --> 00:41:22,877
Leave the dead.

00:41:38,897 --> 00:41:40,364
You know the right target?
你知道正确的目标是什么吗？

362
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:43,191
Do you?
难道你知道？

363
00:41:45,204 --> 00:41:46,603
Just do your thing, Painter.
去做你的事吧，“定位人”

364
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:48,299
Move out, Hargs.
哈克斯，撤退

365
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:52,296
We have confirmation.
The target is lit.

The countdown starts now,
gentlemen.
先生们，行动开始倒数

Prep the chopper on pad five.

是，先生，收到
我们就等你的命令了

370
00:43:19,131 --> 00:43:21,827
All right, Helo One,
you're cleared for takeoff.
好，你可以起飞了

371
00:43:22,034 --> 00:43:23,865
We'll see you on the other side.
在另一边再见，再会了

372
00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:25,627
Roger that, Mother.
！！！

373
00:43:25,938 --> 00:43:29,396
Contact Wingate Field,
report status to Colonel Reynolds.
最后一次向雷纳德中尉联络
还是没有联络到，无线电频率受阻

374
00:43:58,437 --> 00:44:00,302
So tell me, how long did you?
还要多久？

375
00:44:16,355 --> 00:44:18,516
Still no contact.
Radio silence maintained.
电子通信还没有反应

376
00:44:18,724 --> 00:44:20,589
Evac operation still on schedule.
！！！

377
00:44:30,702 --> 00:44:33,500
Keep moving. Keep moving.
走吧，快走吧

378
00:44:40,312 --> 00:44:42,177
I told you.
！！！

379
00:45:02,968 --> 00:45:05,027
Stay awake. Stay awake.

How much further?
还有多远？

Evac's at 0500 hours.

但是没有回报吗？

你应该仅仅是看着他们

the frequency in the area.

when the place is taken out.
当这里被占领之后
我本不会被留下的

I'm touched by your deep sense
of self-interest.

You promised me the money
and safe passage.

bearing three mark seven.

我们在莫斯科的朋友

Put guards at the place he targeted.

00:56:21,245 --> 00:56:23,110
What makes you think
he will come here...

487
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:25,611
...and not contact the girl?

488
00:56:27,485 --> 00:56:29,510

He's probably watching us now...

- It's not enough.

00:57:07,425 --> 00:57:09,552
We need to know
what happened on that evac.
这还不够，我们需要知道
那次撤退中出了什么事

494
00:57:09,794 --> 00:57:11,785

Just you and me...
好吗，听我说

500
00:57:29,747 --> 00:57:31,112
...nobody else. You understand?
只有你和我
别人不能知道，明白吗

You're the only one I trust.

Something's off about this mission.
这次任务很不对劲

503
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:39,151
I don't know who's pulling the strings
there, but I think we're being set up.
我不知道是谁在勒着我们的脖子

阿曼达？

给我…阿曼达

507
00:57:47,231 --> 00:57:48,596
What the hell is going on?
到底怎么回事？   你？

508
00:57:49,634 --> 00:57:51,932
- Tensor?
- What happened on the evac?
撤退时出了什么事？

509
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:53,398
Put Amanda back on.
让阿曼达听

510
00:57:54,405 --> 00:57:55,838

01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:13,176

I don't get it.
我真是…不明白

We were on the chopper,
and we were clear to go.
我们上了直升机
可以安全离开了

515
01:00:17,615 --> 01:00:19,913
Why would they wait until then
to try and waste us?
为什么他们直到那时候
才拦住我们？

516
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:23,780
It was all too easy. We just waltzed
on in there like we owned the place.
一直都太顺利了，我们好像如入无人之境

517
01:00:23,988 --> 01:00:25,751
Yeah, no shit.
对，怎么可能

518
01:00:26,524 --> 01:00:28,424
And these fuckers played us.
这些混蛋耍了我们

519
01:00:28,626 --> 01:00:30,924
I mean, what the fuck
is going on here, captain?
到底怎么回事，队长？

520
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:33,221
Let's just concentrate
on trying to get us out.
咱们还是想想怎么脱身吧

521
01:00:33,431 --> 01:00:34,728
Yeah, right.
对，好啊，看看周围

522
01:00:34,932 --> 01:00:38,095
Take a look around. I don't think so.
我觉得不可能

523
01:00:40,471 --> 01:00:43,099
- He said something wasn't right.
- Did he give you any proof?
他说有什么不对劲

524
01:00:44,008 --> 01:00:45,441
No.
他给你什么证明了吗？   不

525
01:00:45,743 --> 01:00:48,940
We have to call off the fighter
until we figure out what's going on.
但我们要让战斗机暂停行动
直到我们明白出了什么事

526
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:51,637
- It's not happening, Amanda.
- You heard what he said.
-不可能，阿曼达
-你听到他说了

527
01:00:51,849 --> 01:00:54,443
I don't think you're an accurate judge
in this situation...
由于你们过去的关系
我认为…

528
01:00:54,652 --> 01:00:57,018
...not considering
your past relationship with him.
你现在下这个判断并不准确

529
01:00:57,221 --> 01:00:59,917
- What's that got to do with it?
- You're too close to him.
那和这件事有什么关系？

530
01:01:00,291 --> 01:01:02,225
Anyone reasonable would see...
你和他走的太近了

531
01:01:02,426 --> 01:01:05,088
...that there is absolutely
no substance to what he's saying.
你无法理智判断出
他所说的话真实性

532
01:01:06,998 --> 01:01:08,431
Look...
听着

533
01:01:09,033 --> 01:01:11,900
...when the evac chopper went down,
he probably got spooked.
当直升机撤退被摧毁的时候
他可能受了严重刺激了

534
01:01:12,103 --> 01:01:15,937
You and I both know, in those kinds of
situations, people's nerves get tested.
你清楚在那种情况下…

535
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:21,173
- Nerves?
- That is all it is, Amanda.
情况就是那样，阿曼达

536
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,712
Mikhail?
I need to ask you a question.
我问你一个问题

537
01:01:58,949 --> 01:02:00,280
Please, go ahead.
请说吧

538
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:04,010
Have you noticed anything
strange about this op?
你觉得最近情况有什么不对劲吗？

539
01:02:04,355 --> 01:02:05,879
How do you mean?
你什么意思？

540
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:08,350
I can't quite explain it.
我解释不太清楚

541
01:02:08,693 --> 01:02:12,254
Does this have anything to do
with your call to the Painter?
这和你与杜贝特的电话有关系吗？

542
01:02:12,763 --> 01:02:14,594
- You know about that?
- Your intelligence...
你知道那件事？

543
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:17,666
...is our intelligence today.
Remember?
你们的间谍
也就是我们的间谍，记得吗？

544
01:02:18,602 --> 01:02:21,036
But I do believe something is strange,
as you said.
不过我确实相信如你所说，
有事情不对劲

545
01:02:21,372 --> 01:02:23,863
Minister lvanov is beside himself
with this matter.
伊万诺夫部长
今天早上因为这件事焦虑不安

546
01:02:24,075 --> 01:02:26,908
- In what way?
- After your helicopter was destroyed...
怎么？
你们的直升机被摧毁后

547
01:02:27,111 --> 01:02:28,976
...I told him there may be a delay.
我告诉他
也许你们的空袭行动会延迟

548
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:32,843
I said it would be a good thing, give
us time to intercept the container...
我说这也许是好事
给我们点时间来检查那个货柜

549
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:36,451
...and justify extreme measure of
an American air strike on Russian soil.
弥补可能会对俄罗斯土壤
造成极端后果的核子污染

550
01:02:36,721 --> 01:02:40,054
But he look at me as...
As if I spit in his face.
而他看着我，好像…
好像我冲他脸上吐口水似的

551
01:02:41,525 --> 01:02:43,356
What are you trying to say, Mikhail?
你想说的是什么？

552
01:02:43,561 --> 01:02:45,961
Look again at the pictures
I sent you of the reactors.
你仔细看看
我发给你的核子反应炉卫星照片

553
01:02:46,163 --> 01:02:48,825
I'm going to send someone
to intercept those planes.
我现在要找人去查一下
那辆货柜车

554
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,731
Okay.
好的

555
01:03:07,685 --> 01:03:13,282
Just to let you know, the Russians
are setting up to stop the truck.
阿曼达，跟你说一声
俄罗斯人准备要拦住货柜车了

556
01:04:06,744 --> 01:04:09,474
Secondary target, just in case.
安装第二目标定位器，以防万一

557
01:04:25,196 --> 01:04:28,529
Hey there. Just got your e-mail.
What is this?
嘿，刚刚收到给你的电邮\这是什么

558
01:04:28,732 --> 01:04:31,326
The nuke plant in Chechnya.
It's from a Russian satellite.
俄国卫星拍到的
在车臣的一个新工厂

559
01:04:31,535 --> 01:04:32,661
Shitty quality.
照片影像很差

560
01:04:33,771 --> 01:04:34,738
What do you see?
你看到什么？

561
01:04:35,539 --> 01:04:37,473
Am I looking
for something in particular?
要找什么特别的目标吗？

562
01:04:38,075 --> 01:04:41,238
- I don't know.
- Okay.
我不知道

563
01:04:57,027 --> 01:04:58,995
Hello.
你好

564
01:05:10,107 --> 01:05:11,574
Somebody's been Photoshopping.
处理底片焦点缩放翻转

565
01:05:12,109 --> 01:05:14,373
- Where? Show me.
- This shadow.
哪里，指给我看？
这里，不论是什么

566
01:05:15,112 --> 01:05:16,875
Whatever's casting it's been erased.
一定是有类似放射性物质的痕迹

567
01:05:17,081 --> 01:05:20,050
Can you check and see if this
was covered by one of our satellites?
你能否看看
我们的卫星照片是否有拍到它

568
01:05:20,384 --> 01:05:24,684
Sure. We'll see what we have
on the date the Russians shot this...
当然，那么我们有这张相片
在同一天俄国人拍下了这张相片

569
01:05:24,889 --> 01:05:27,016
...and the computer
will overlay the two...
电脑将两张相片进行对比

570
01:05:27,224 --> 01:05:28,885
...and identify any discrepancies.
看能否找到任何的蛛丝马迹

571
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:36,092
Is that what you're looking for?
这是不是你要找的东西呢？

572
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:40,361
Oh, my God. The truck's already been
there. We're following a decoy.
天哪，那辆车已经到过那里了
我们跟踪的车是伪装的

573
01:05:40,571 --> 01:05:41,868
Get me hard copies.
给我接海军部

574
01:05:43,974 --> 01:05:46,704
You're violating Russian airspace.
Stand down.
你现在进入了俄国领空，出去

575
01:05:47,077 --> 01:05:49,170
We have clearance
from the Russian government.
我进入这里有俄国政府批准的

576
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:50,936
That's not what we were told.
上头并没有通知我

577
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:55,885
He's trying to lock on.
These guys are going hot.
锁定目标…警报
来者不善，接招吧

578
01:06:03,761 --> 01:06:05,388
Let's see if he can catch me now.
现在看你是否追得上我

579
01:06:11,335 --> 01:06:14,827
- He's still on our 6.
- I know a few tricks. We'll lose him.
我不懂你说什么

580
01:06:21,178 --> 01:06:23,112
Going for weapons lock.
现在看谁锁定谁

581
01:06:31,088 --> 01:06:32,885
Almost there.
好，差不多了

582
01:06:36,627 --> 01:06:38,424
Fire fox one, fire fox one.
发射一号导弹，发射一号导弹

583
01:06:41,332 --> 01:06:43,857
Hold on, hold on. Got another.
等等，等等，又来了一个

584
01:06:44,902 --> 01:06:46,665
I see him. Hang on, hang on!
等等，等等

585
01:06:50,274 --> 01:06:52,765
- We're losing power.
- Put your poker face on, Randall.
-我们正在失去动力
-把备用燃料连上，速战速决

586
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:55,644
Just play a little Texas Hold'em.
警告

587
01:07:05,089 --> 01:07:08,115
- He's got a lock.
- Not for long. Hang on.
我们又被锁定了

588
01:07:11,662 --> 01:07:13,357
That's more like it.
这回可不会…坐稳了

589
01:07:16,734 --> 01:07:18,531
I almost got a lock.
这回你可跑不掉了

590
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:27,407
Fire fox two.
发射二号导弹

591
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:38,813
This is Shadow One.
Hostiles taken care of.
这里是阴影一号，问题解决

592
01:07:49,366 --> 01:07:51,698
Hello. May I help you?
你好，有什么需要帮忙吗？

593
01:07:52,136 --> 01:07:54,195
I'm sorry,
I was looking for Mikhail Beslan.
抱歉，我找马可．比斯林

594
01:07:54,605 --> 01:07:56,903
Mr. Beslan has been reassigned.
比斯林先生暂时停职了

595
01:07:57,441 --> 01:07:58,408
Are you sure?
真的吗？
任何询问比斯林先生的电话

596
01:07:58,609 --> 01:08:02,340
Any inquiries about Mr. Beslan should
be placed with the Ministry of Defense.
将被转接到国防部

597
01:08:02,546 --> 01:08:04,571
Thank you.
谢谢！

598
01:08:20,364 --> 01:08:21,558
Painter, this is Hargreaves.
“定位人”，我是哈得利斯

599
01:08:22,066 --> 01:08:24,728
I'm in the tunnel.
I got bogeys down here.
我在地下管道里面
我发现了些东西

600
01:08:53,263 --> 01:08:56,426
- Yeah.
- Everything is in place, sir.
喂？一切就位了，先生

601
01:08:56,934 --> 01:08:58,196
Have they stopped the truck?
他们拦住了卡车吗？

602
01:08:58,402 --> 01:09:01,235
Yes, sir. We have the men
starting to open it now.
是，先生，
我们的人现在正要开箱检查

603
01:09:01,705 --> 01:09:05,197
- Let me know when they open it.
- Yes, sir.
一打开里面就通知我
是，先生

604
01:09:28,532 --> 01:09:31,968
Hi. The radiation suits
are in the car.
嗨．防辐射器具就在车里

605
01:09:45,382 --> 01:09:47,942
Hargs, stay put. I'll find you.
你待着别动，我会来找你

606
01:10:03,867 --> 01:10:05,198
There he is! Let's go!
他在那里，上

607
01:10:40,938 --> 01:10:44,669
I know where they're being held.
Go, go!
我知道他们关在哪里   快走

608
01:11:00,591 --> 01:11:02,183
Give me Jonathan Tensor.
给我接将军办公室

609
01:11:02,593 --> 01:11:04,720
The Painter was on to something,
so was Beslan.
“定位人”一定知道了什么

610
01:11:05,262 --> 01:11:06,752
And now he's been reassigned.
所以他现在根据行动准则
将自动更新了任务

611
01:11:08,398 --> 01:11:09,626
All right.
那好

612
01:11:09,967 --> 01:11:12,128
Convince me.
说服我

613
01:11:14,037 --> 01:11:15,766
Painter said he thought
it was a setup.
“定位人”说那是个圈套

614
01:11:16,139 --> 01:11:18,107
Amanda, that could mean anything.
阿曼达，那什么也不能说明

615
01:11:18,742 --> 01:11:21,540
What if lvanov planned
this whole thing?
如果是伊万诺夫搞的鬼呢？

616
01:11:21,912 --> 01:11:24,574
What if he set us up to go in
like cowboys, thinking...
如果他引诱我们去那里

617
01:11:24,848 --> 01:11:28,011
...we were taking out a reactor
before Zaysan could re-core it...
让我们以为自己是在…

618
01:11:28,218 --> 01:11:30,482
...only, it's already been re-cored.
塞辛重新启动反应炉前摧毁它
但其实它已经被重新启动了呢？

619
01:11:30,721 --> 01:11:32,712
That's what they're unloading
off this truck.
所以他们才会在那里卸下这辆车

620
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:37,251
What could lvanov possibly gain
from something so insane?
计划这么疯狂的事
对伊万诺夫有什么好处？

621
01:11:38,061 --> 01:11:39,255
He's a hard-liner.
他是强硬派人物

622
01:11:39,563 --> 01:11:43,624
He's fallen in with the new Russia,
but he doesn't like it. We know that.
表面上服从俄罗斯新秧序管制，
但心存不满

623
01:11:44,067 --> 01:11:47,594
Imagine what would happen
if we hit a live reactor.
这我们都知道，想像一下会发生什么事
如果我们击中运作中的反应炉

624
01:11:47,938 --> 01:11:49,838
It'd be hundreds of thousands dead.
几百万人将会死亡

625
01:11:50,274 --> 01:11:53,038
Think where the blame would fall,
the country that caused it...
想想国际舆论会如何谴责
那个导致如此后果的国家

626
01:11:53,243 --> 01:11:55,211
...and the country
that allowed it to happen.
以及允许这事发生的国家？

627
01:11:55,412 --> 01:11:58,506
And political control of Russia
would be up for grabs.
俄罗斯的政治又会瓦解了

628
01:12:00,751 --> 01:12:03,811
Something has been bothering me
from the start.
从一开始我就觉得有什么不对劲

629
01:12:04,288 --> 01:12:06,950
Usually you have to drag everything
out of the Russians...
通常我们必须从俄国的盒子里
抢食物才行

630
01:12:07,157 --> 01:12:08,886
...but this time they handed it to us.
但这次他们却双手
奉上控制权到我们面前

631
01:12:09,092 --> 01:12:11,458
And every bit of it
was through Viktor lvanov.
而又全都是
通过维克多伊万诺夫的管道

632
01:12:11,662 --> 01:12:14,631
I give you this,
it's crazy enough to be possible...
我的结论是
这简直疯狂得有点可信

633
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:17,356
...except for one small detail.
- What's that?
除了一个小细节？

634
01:12:17,567 --> 01:12:19,933
The Russians stopped
the container an hour ago.
俄罗斯人一小时之前拦住了卡车

635
01:12:20,137 --> 01:12:24,039
From the outside, it tested positive
for radioactive levels.
从外面检测的结果
是有放射性物质

636
01:12:24,708 --> 01:12:27,541
The specialists are in the process
of opening it now.
专家正在开箱检查

637
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:32,405
Don't look so devastated.
不要感到这么失落

638
01:12:32,683 --> 01:12:35,413
I think your assumptions
are reasonable.
我觉得你的推测很有道理

639
01:12:35,719 --> 01:12:37,619
You're doing a terrific job, Amanda.
阿曼达你的工作表现非常好

640
01:12:37,821 --> 01:12:39,948
Everybody's very impressed.
我们都有目共暗

641
01:12:47,297 --> 01:12:50,130
This is it. They're being kept inside.
就是这里！他们被关在里面

642
01:12:52,803 --> 01:12:54,270
Right there.
就在那里面

643
01:14:36,873 --> 01:14:38,500
We gotta get out of here.
我们得出去

644
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:41,978
The fighter's about to enter
Russian airspace.
战斗机朝俄军基地去了

645
01:14:42,179 --> 01:14:45,273
- How long till we hit the target?
- Thirteen minutes.
-多久之后对目标进行攻击？
-l3分钟

646
01:14:48,752 --> 01:14:53,951
Still on approach.
ETA from target zone: 12 minutes.
正在接近中，
预计到达时间还有l2分l2秒

647
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:08,436
Get away! Don't touch it!
走开，别碰它

648
01:15:08,738 --> 01:15:10,672
There could be static on your hand.
万一被你搞坏了

649
01:15:10,907 --> 01:15:13,637
It could shorten out the target.
锁定的目标就被转移到别处去

650
01:15:22,486 --> 01:15:25,546
Everyone will understand
your sacrifice, Andre.
大家都理解你的牺牲   安卓恩

651
01:15:26,056 --> 01:15:28,650
I'll make certain of it.
抱歉！我也造成了其中的一部分

652
01:15:29,392 --> 01:15:33,795
Soon, this pathetic Chechnya
will be a forgotten wasteland.
很快，这个车臣
将会成为被遗忘的废墟

653
01:15:34,364 --> 01:15:37,492
And our Mother Russia
will be great again.
而俄罗斯呢？将会再次强大

654
01:15:42,272 --> 01:15:44,866
The guards are dead.
The Americans have escaped.
守卫死了，美国人逃走了

655
01:15:46,209 --> 01:15:47,608
It's time.
也差不多到时候了

656
01:15:48,411 --> 01:15:49,844
Don't worry.
别担心

657
01:15:50,247 --> 01:15:53,739
I will make sure
nobody comes here.
我保证没人能进来捣乱的

658
01:16:02,692 --> 01:16:03,989
Pull back. Pull back. Come on.
撤退！撤退！快

659
01:16:04,327 --> 01:16:06,522
We gotta get 1000 yards away
from that reactor.
我们要离那个反应炉越远越好

660
01:16:29,352 --> 01:16:31,820
Naish, keep your men moving.
I'll catch up.
纳许，让你的人继续撤离

661
01:16:32,222 --> 01:16:33,621
Stay clear of the village hall.
我会跟上，保持联络好吗？

662
01:16:34,057 --> 01:16:37,049
- What are you talking about?
- It's where I lit the secondary target.
-你说什么呢？
-我要启动第二目标定位

663
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:39,421
Who the hell told you
to light a secondary target?
谁让你去引导第二目标点了

664
01:16:39,629 --> 01:16:42,757
This mission was off.
Primary target was a setup.
这次任务结束了
主要目标点，确定是一个圈套

665
01:16:42,966 --> 01:16:45,025
What the fuck are we standing
around here for?
我们到底是来干嘛？

666
01:16:45,235 --> 01:16:48,432
- Our orders were for us...
- To target a dormant reactor.
我们的任务是占领反应炉

667
01:16:48,838 --> 01:16:50,897
- This one has a live core in it.
- A what?
-这是运作中的反应炉
-什么？

668
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:54,372
They used the hostages to re-core
the third reactor before we got here.
他们在我们来之前
已经利用人质启动了第三反应炉

669
01:16:54,678 --> 01:16:56,475
Dead hostages had edema
in their eyes.
那些人质的眼睛就是证明…
为什么

670
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:59,781
- The fuck is edema?
- First signs of radiation sickness.
那种现象是放射线造成的第一反映

671
01:17:00,183 --> 01:17:01,980
I hadn't figured it out until I saw...
我是直到撤退被阻的时候
才想明白的

672
01:17:02,185 --> 01:17:04,915
...that we were being shadowed
on the way back to the evac.
我可不知道，难怪…

673
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:08,056
Moffit did lead us through
like we owned the place.
我们进来时
感觉就像是自己的地盘一样

674
01:17:08,325 --> 01:17:11,590
Look, we played right
into Zaysan's fucked-up plan.
你们看，
塞辛的计划被我们打乱了

675
01:17:11,995 --> 01:17:14,190
Now, I gotta deactivate
that primary core.
现在我要去
解除第一目标的信号

676
01:17:14,397 --> 01:17:17,798
No, man. We ain't changing the op
because you got a hunch.
不会吧！就因为你的什么预感
就要我们改变目标？

677
01:17:19,002 --> 01:17:21,664
I guess you're gonna have
to shoot me, huh?
难道你要朝我开枪吗？

678
01:17:21,871 --> 01:17:23,395
I gotta do what's right.
那么就这么办吧

679
01:17:25,575 --> 01:17:28,100
- I'm out of here, captain.
- Rodgers.
我要走了
罗杰斯！

680
01:17:29,312 --> 01:17:32,247
Sir, I think he's right.
长官！我觉得他是对的！

681
01:17:35,852 --> 01:17:37,615
Go.
去吧！

682
01:18:06,716 --> 01:18:08,616
There is another container
in the truck.
车上是否有个柜子？

683
01:18:08,885 --> 01:18:10,182
Well, get it open.
我们可以打开的

684
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:40,807
Now acquiring target coordinates.
Locking on to signal.
确认目标地点，锁定信号

685
01:18:55,799 --> 01:18:57,733
Target is in that dome right there.
第一目标定位就在里面

686
01:19:00,170 --> 01:19:01,933
How you gonna deactivate it?
要怎么解除它的信号？

687
01:19:02,138 --> 01:19:03,662
Electrical charge shuts it down.
把电池拿掉就行了

688
01:19:04,941 --> 01:19:07,409
Missile gets diverted
to the secondary target.
这样就自动转移
到第二目标定位点

689
01:19:09,612 --> 01:19:11,978
Well, we're not getting through that.
我们进不去那里的

690
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:15,774
How much C-4 did you pack up?
你带了多少定时炸弹来？

691
01:19:59,262 --> 01:20:01,196
How long till firing now?

692
01:20:02,632 --> 01:20:04,623
- Six minutes, sir.
- Very good.
-6分钟，长官
-很好

693
01:20:06,269 --> 01:20:07,600
Still on approach vector.
上！

694
01:20:40,537 --> 01:20:43,404
Hold this position. I'm going up top.
守住这里，我上去

695
01:20:58,254 --> 01:21:00,620
I can hold them up from here, sir.
我在这里可以拦住他们，长官

696
01:21:20,610 --> 01:21:22,601
Take out the jeep!
快去占领制高点

697
01:22:22,972 --> 01:22:25,873
- How much time now?
- Less than two minutes.
-还有多少时间？
-不到2分钟

698
01:23:21,097 --> 01:23:22,496
Missile is armed and hot.
导弹武器准备完毕

699
01:23:29,539 --> 01:23:31,700
What? What the hell
you talking about?
什么？你到底在说什么？

700
01:23:32,575 --> 01:23:33,872
What is it?
那里面是什么？

701
01:23:34,077 --> 01:23:37,103
Someone irradiated dead pigs.
死鱼的尸体

702
01:23:38,848 --> 01:23:40,110
It's the container.
装在货柜里

703
01:23:53,863 --> 01:23:55,330
We gotta call off the fighter.
叫战斗机停止

704
01:23:56,699 --> 01:23:57,791
Do it.
快照做！

705
01:23:58,101 --> 01:23:59,534
Missile away.
发射

706
01:24:02,605 --> 01:24:05,369
Too late. The missile's on its way.
太晚了，导弹已经发射了

707
01:24:07,243 --> 01:24:08,904
Oh, my God.
哦，上帝啊

708
01:24:57,894 --> 01:24:59,088
Target is down.
主要目标脱离锁定状态

709
01:25:04,667 --> 01:25:05,861
Secondary is hot.
第二目标定位点启动了

710
01:25:07,303 --> 01:25:08,497
What secondary target?
什么第二目标？

711
01:25:16,813 --> 01:25:18,474
No!
不！

712
01:25:28,224 --> 01:25:30,818
That son of a bitch did it.
那个家伙成功了

713
01:26:28,651 --> 01:26:30,516
You look like shit too.
看什么？你自己也惨不忍睹

714
01:27:24,473 --> 01:27:26,600
Amanda, what is it?
阿曼达，什么事？

715
01:27:26,809 --> 01:27:29,573
That was the Kremlin.
Viktor lvanov is dead.
此次事件的主谋
维克多伊万诺夫死了

716
01:27:41,857 --> 01:27:44,189
They're saying it's suicide.
对外宣称是自杀

717
01:27:44,594 --> 01:27:47,620
It looks like he's been set up
to take the fall.
看起来他也被陷害背黑锅了

718
01:27:49,565 --> 01:27:53,194
If the missile hadn't diverted,
the Kremlin would be in chaos.
如果导弹没有转向
克里姆林宫现在就可要爆炸了

719
01:27:53,703 --> 01:27:56,900
God knows
how deep this really goes.
天知道还有多少隐藏的背后黑手

720
01:28:20,029 --> 01:28:22,554
I'll be leaving for Washington
in the morning.
我早上就要回华盛顿了

721
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:27,660
They'll call you in
for your account pretty soon.
他们将让你去欧洲驻扎等待命令

722
01:28:29,105 --> 01:28:31,369
Just like old times.
就像以前一样

723
01:28:32,208 --> 01:28:33,470
Not quite the same.
不太一样了

724
01:28:33,709 --> 01:28:37,406
This time you'll have to say
you went against orders.
这次你终于可以说
你终于没有按照命令作了

725
01:28:39,448 --> 01:28:43,441
I listened to my instincts.
So did you.
我听从我的本能，你也是

726
01:28:46,856 --> 01:28:50,485
- They'll investigate my part, I'm sure.
- Yeah.
相信我们两个
都没能让我放开那一段过…去！

727
01:28:51,627 --> 01:28:54,061
Well, when they do...
不过真到了这种地步

728
01:28:54,297 --> 01:28:57,323
...piece of advice
from my experience:
根据我的经验来看
有个建议给你

729
01:28:58,634 --> 01:29:02,331
Don't get too close to the person
asking the questions.
不要离得太近，
除非那个人先向你提出这个问题

730
01:29:02,705 --> 01:29:04,002
Is that so?
是吗？

731
01:29:05,041 --> 01:29:06,474
Yeah.
对

732
01:29:07,376 --> 01:29:09,344
Because when you do...
因为当你太接近的时候

733
01:29:11,414 --> 01:29:14,611
...then they're gonna have
to answer to me.
那么它们就要符合我的标准才行

734
01:29:29,699 --> 01:29:32,099
My flight's not for eight hours.
离我的飞机起飞还有8小时

735
01:29:35,705 --> 01:29:37,969
That's a long time.
那是很长时间啊
