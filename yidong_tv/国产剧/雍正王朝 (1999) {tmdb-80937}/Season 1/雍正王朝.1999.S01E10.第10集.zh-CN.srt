00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,900
You think you know a story, but you only know how it ends.

2
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,200
To get to the heart of the story, you have to go back to the beginning.

~ Season 1- Episode 10 ~ "The Death of Wolsey"

4
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,700
His Majesty, the king.

5
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:04,300
My lords and councillors, there is a great deal of work to do.

6
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,700
In the past, those who held the reins of government deceived me.

7
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,800
Many things were done without my knowledge or my approval.

8
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,700
But such proceedings will stop in the future.

9
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,300
Your Grace will be appointed president of the council.

10
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,000
Jointly with the Duke of Suffolk.

11
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,000
Your Majesty.

12
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,700
We shall convene again very shortly.

13
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
To discuss those matters which remain close to our hearts.

14
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,400
A word.

15
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,600
Although it pleases me much...

16
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,900
...that Wolsey is no longer here among us, yet...

17
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:03,700
Even in his absence, does he not cause you disquiet?

18
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,900
How so?

19
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,400
He was attaindered, but not for treason.

20
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,200
Which means he still lives.

21
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,600
And so long as he lives, he remains a danger both to the realm and to us.

22
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,300
He is far away in York. In disgrace.

23
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,100
I think you exaggerate the danger.

24
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,500
And I think that you don't understand it.

25
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,000
The king, as you know, could easily change his mind.

26
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,200
And if he did, if Wolsey ever returned to this court...

27
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,200
...we would both have cause enough to fear his vengeance.

28
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:43,040
约克郡 红衣主教沃尔西的教堂别院

29
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,300
This is intolerable. We must have the roof mended.

30
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,400
With what and by whom?

31
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,900
We have no money and no bloody servants.

32
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,800
Surely, the king never meant you to live so wretchedly?

33
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,700
After all, you are still archbishop of York.

34
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Well, perhaps it's not the king's fault.

35
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,700
I have had cause to remember the old prophecy:

36
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,500
"When the cow rideth the bull, then, priest, beware thy skull. "

37
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,300
You mean that cow Anne Boleyn?

38
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,800
Indeed so.

39
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,900
Which is why I'm writing her this letter.

40
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
Even if she's the cause of all our misery?

41
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,400
Well, yes, since she's the cause, she can also be the cure.

42
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,400
I just have to persuade her that I am not her enemy, but her friend.

43
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,500
I still have the letter in which she promises to reward me...

44
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:02,000
...for all my pains and efforts at such time as she becomes crowned.

45
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,000
I seem to remember at the time...

46
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,600
...you thought her promises rather amusing.

47
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Well, yes, perhaps I did.

48
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,300
Since then I have rather lost my sense of humour.

49
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:20,000
Sir Thomas, I notice you allow yourself none of the trappings of your office.

50
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm not so vain as to display its power, Master Cromwell.

51
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,200
But I tell you this, I fully intend to use it.

52
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,400
- May I ask to what effect? - Here, for example.

53
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,900
Here is a report of a sermon recently given in Cambridge...

54
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,000
...by a certain Hugh Latimer.

55
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,000
A senior member of the university. And I quote:

56
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,800
"Mr. Latimer said that holy scripture should be read in the English tongue...

57
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,200
...of all Christian people whether priest or layman.

58
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,000
He raged against the gilding of images...

59
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:07,200
...the running of pilgrimages, and superstitious devotion.

60
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,000
He said that all men were priests...

61
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,200
...and that we had no need for priests or popes on Earth. "

62
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,600
Times have changed, Master Cromwell.

63
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,700
Now I plainly see the risk and danger involved in such an open-door policy...

64
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,700
...towards these newfangled, erroneous sects.

65
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,300
You condemn all Reformers as heretics?

66
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,100
Wolsey was far too soft on them.

67
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,600
I intend not to be.

68
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,000
Will you burn them?

69
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,600
"This belief that pope and clergy possess separate power...

70
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,100
...and authority is contrary to scripture.

71
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,100
The king is the representative of God on Earth...

72
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,300
...and his law is God's law.

73
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,200
The ruler is accountable to God alone...

74
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,000
...and the obedience of his subjects is an obedience required by God.

75
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,100
For the Church and the pope to rule the princes of Europe...

76
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,400
...is not only a shame above all shames but an inversion of the divine order.

77
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:28,400
One king and one law in God's name in every realm. "

78
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,600
This book is a book for me, and for all kings.

79
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,100
And there are other books like it.

80
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,100
Books which detail the abuses of power, privileges...

81
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,600
...the greed of the clergy in Your Majesty's realm.

82
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,800
Books which Wolsey deliberately kept hidden from you.

83
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,700
I should like to read them.

84
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,500
Now I've taken power unto myself...

85
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,000
...I shall work day and night if necessary to resolve things.

86
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,700
Including my annulment.

87
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,800
I swear to you now everything will be different.

88
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,300
His Majesty the king.

89
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,100
- Ambassador Chapuys. - Your Majesty.

90
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,500
I hear you are a very able and intelligent diplomat.

91
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:33,100
Like me, I'm sure you're aware of all the new religious controversies.

92
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,700
I know of some new heresies that have sprang up here and there, certainly.

93
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,500
If only the pope and his cardinals could set aside their vain pomp...

94
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,600
...start living according to the precepts of the gospels the and early fathers.

95
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,400
I am well aware Your Majesty...

96
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,000
...is in the midst of an argument with His Holiness.

97
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,100
I'm not talking about myself.

98
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,400
You see, when Luther attacked the vice...

99
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,700
...and corruption of the clergy, he was right.

100
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,700
Had he stopped, and not gone on to destroy the sacraments...

101
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,700
...and so on, I would have raised my pen in his defence...

102
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,600
...rather than attacking him.

103
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,100
The need for reformation in the Church is manifest.

104
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:22,100
The emperor has a duty to promote it. As do I in my own domain.

105
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,800
I'm glad we've had this opportunity to exchange opinions.

106
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,700
- Your Majesty. - Ambassador.

107
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,200
- I'm surprised you have so much time. - To do what?

108
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,900
- To do nothing. - What are you saying?

109
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,700
Aren't you supposed to be running the country?

110
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,100
I leave that to Norfolk. He's had more practise.

111
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,000
In any case, meetings with ambassadors, infinitely tedious.

112
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,700
They're all liars, hypocrites, and middle-aged men.

113
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,700
Would you prefer them to be women?

114
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,400
My friend, if all ambassadors were beautiful women...

115
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,200
...I'd be serving my country day and night.

116
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,400
- Here we are. - Your Grace.

117
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,200
Let me present my ward, Miss Catherine Brooke.

118
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,200
- Sir Anthony Knivert. - Miss Catherine.

119
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,700
- Sir. - Anthony's one of our finest horsemen.

120
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,300
Except for when I fall off.

121
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,000
- You enjoying your walk? - Yes.

122
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,700
Good. Then I shan't delay you any further.

123
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,300
Put your back into it, lads.

124
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,500
- Pretty little thing, isn't she? - Indeed, she is.

125
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,300
I'm gonna marry her.

126
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,100
You've been in exile, Mr. Fish?

127
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,600
Yes, sir.

128
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,700
It was Cardinal Wolsey's pleasure to keep me in Holland...

129
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,300
...for fear I might speak the truth.

130
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,300
So why did you try to return?

131
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,900
I thought, sir, that with the cardinal fallen and sent away...

132
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,600
...that circumstances in this country might be changed for the better.

133
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,500
More tolerant.

134
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
Do you have friends in this country?

135
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,800
- Of course, sir, as an Englishman. - At court?

136
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,500
Do you have friends at court?

137
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,100
Do you deny you are the author of this work...

138
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,400
...A Supplication for the Beggars?

139
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
No, sir.

140
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,400
What is it?

141
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,800
Sir, an appeal to His Majesty...

142
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,700
...to redress many of the terrible and scandalous abuses of the Church.

143
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,500
You seem to suggest that the real aim of the Church...

144
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,600
...is to seize all power, lordship, obedience and dignity from the king.

145
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,800
In fact, you go further. You claim that the Church itself...

146
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,000
...is a source of rebellion and disobedience against the king.

147
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,700
Don't you, Mr. Fish?

148
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,700
And here, Mr. Fish, if I may.

149
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,200
You say that the exactions taken from the people...

150
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,800
...are not given to a kind, temporal prince...

151
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,500
...but to "a cruel, devilish bloodsucker...

152
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,400
...drunken in the blood of the martyrs and saints of Christ. "

153
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,000
Shame on you, Mr. Fish.

154
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,200
For who are these cruel, devilish bloodsuckers...

155
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,300
...but the anointed priests of our holy Church.

156
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,000
Those who show us the way to heaven.

157
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,700
But then, you don't believe in that either, do you, Mr. Fish?

158
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,400
Who are you?

159
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:49,400
I'm a Christian man, the child of everlasting joy...

160
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,100
...through the merits of the bitter passion of Christ.

161
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,300
This is the joyful answer.

162
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,700
It is also heresy.

163
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,900
What is it? What has she done?

164
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,100
She is wearing purple.

165
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,900
And purple is the colour of royalty.

166
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,400
You know, I sometimes wish...

167
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,100
...that all Spaniards were at the bottom of the sea.

168
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,400
Mistress Boleyn...

169
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,500
...you should not abuse the queen's honour with such language.

170
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,000
I care nothing for Catherine.

171
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,800
I would rather see her hanged than acknowledge her as my mistress.

172
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,800
- Is that it? - Yes, Your Majesty.

173
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,200
Thank God.

174
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
What is it, Mr. Cromwell?

175
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,500
Your Majesty, I...

176
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,800
Mr. Cromwell.

177
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,500
I must beg Your Majesty's indulgence, and forgiveness, before I...

178
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,100
Go on.

179
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,700
I had cause, recently, on a visit to Waltham Abbey...

180
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,300
...to speak to a learned friend there.

181
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,200
We spoke about Your Majesty's great matter.

182
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,100
We came to the conclusion Your Majesty's advisers...

183
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,700
...might not, perhaps, be approaching the matter...

184
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,900
...in the most convenient way to solve it.

185
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,200
- You mean through the courts? - Yes.

186
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,700
As Your Majesty well knows, kings are set above the law.

187
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,600
They are answerable to God alone, who anointed them.

188
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,000
So it seems to us that the matter is not, and never has been, a legal one.

189
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,200
It is a theological one.

190
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,900
But in that case, who should pass verdict upon it?

191
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,500
We would suggest...

192
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,900
...that Your Majesty canvass the opinion of theologians...

193
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,400
...at colleges around Europe.

194
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,400
Their sentence would be pronounced...

195
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,900
...and could be implemented with little industry.

196
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,600
And by that simple measure...

197
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,900
...I trust that Your Majesty's troubled conscience might be pacified.

198
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,200
Will you write a paper showing your argument?

199
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,100
- Lf Your Majesty trusts me to do so. - No, I command you to do so.

200
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,900
Then I command you, as a royal agent...

201
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,800
...visit the universities in Europe.

202
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,400
I want the opinion of their theological faculties as soon as possible.

203
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,200
Thank you, Mr. Cromwell.

204
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,900
There's still time to recant of your heresy, Mr. Fish.

205
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,100
If you acknowledge that your opinions were misguided, evil...

206
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,900
...contrary to the law of God...

207
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,700
...then you will be spared the great pains you must otherwise endure.

208
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,800
I beg of you, acknowledge your sins.

209
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,800
God will welcome you back into his fold.

210
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,600
Recant.

211
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,600
Recant, you still have a moment.

212
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:16,800
The Lord is my shepherd, I can want nothing.

213
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:22,300
He feedeth me in green pastures, he leadeth me to fresh waters.

214
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,000
Though I should walk now in the valley of the shadow of death...

215
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,000
...yet I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.

216
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,800
Thy staff and thy sheep, they comfort me.

217
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,200
Thou preparest a table for me, against mine enemies.

218
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,400
My head Thou anoints with oil, and filleth my cup full.

219
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,600
Oh, let thy loving-kindness and mercy follow me all the days of my life...

220
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,900
...that I mayest dwell in the Lord's house for ever.

221
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,200
I have something I want to say to you.

222
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,500
I have decided to ennoble you and your family.

223
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,000
You are to be created Earl of Wiltshire and Ormonde...

224
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,400
...and I am also appointing you Lord Privy Seal.

225
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
George will become Lord Rochford...

226
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,900
...and be made a member of council.

227
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,900
Your Majesty, I'm lost for words.

228
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,700
Your bounty is unceasing.

229
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,900
I also have high hopes for Mr. Cromwell.

230
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,700
I'm glad. He is a friend of the family.

231
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,100
You know his thesis.

232
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,100
I want you to visit the pope and the emperor at Bologna.

233
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,200
I want you to put to them our new case.

234
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,100
Please tell me you are not losing hope.

235
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,600
It is true, I...

236
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,300
I had always fancied that the king...

237
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,000
...after pursuing his course for some time, would turn away...

238
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,500
...would yield to his conscience, and change his purpose...

239
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,900
...as he has done so often before.

240
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,700
I believed with all my heart that he would return to reason.

241
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,100
But now I...

242
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,600
Madam, I pray you. Don't give way.

243
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,900
No, Excellence. I shall never give way.

244
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,700
Thank you for what you have done for my father.

245
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,400
For my whole family.

246
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,400
There's more.

247
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,500
I've made alterations to Wolsey's old palace at York Place.

248
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,300
You said you liked it.

249
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,700
I am giving it to you.

250
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,700
What is it?

251
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,400
Have I made you unhappy?

252
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,600
No.

253
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,300
I would only be unhappy if you ever stopped loving me.

254
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,700
London would have to melt into the Thames first.

255
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,900
It is everything now for the lady Anne?

256
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,500
Sir Thomas, does this not remind you of a wedding feast?

257
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,000
It seems to me that nothing is wanted but a priest...

258
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:04,400
...to give away the nuptial rings and pronounce the blessing.

259
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,100
God forbid that should happen.

260
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,700
It's none of my business.

261
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,800
My new job as chancellor...

262
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,800
...will be to do my utmost to contend for the interests of Christendom.

263
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,900
Perhaps the king's Majesty...

264
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,800
...is more inclined towards the Reformers than you know.

265
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,700
I don't think so.

266
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,100
I know him better than you do, Excellence.

267
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,100
His deepest instincts are traditional and faithful.

268
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,300
He may threaten to break with Rome...

269
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,500
...but I don't think he will ever do so.

270
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I hope you are right.

271
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,000
The consequences would be unthinkable.

272
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,100
Everything seems to move in your favour, Your Grace.

273
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,800
I have bad news.

274
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,000
I happen to know that the king...

275
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:01,900
...has sent Wolsey an intaglio portrait of himself.

276
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,700
So?

277
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,200
So it is traditionally a sign of goodwill.

278
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,000
It may presage a reconciliation.

279
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,400
A small gift to ease the king's conscience is hardly a sign...

280
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,600
...that the bishop of York will be restored to his former glory.

281
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,400
Think of it this way.

282
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,300
When Satan fell from heaven, was he ever invited back?

283
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,000
You were.

284
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:34,700
I see that you have accepted patronage from Mr. Cromwell, Mr. Wyatt.

285
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,100
How very transparent the world is.

286
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,300
But was I wrong to do so, Tallis?

287
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,500
I think so. Yeah. You should be your own man.

288
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,000
Don't be a fool, Tallis. You won't survive long in this slippery world...

289
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,900
...without the support of a great man.

290
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,000
You think Mr. Cromwell is a great man?

291
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,000
No, I think he's a coming man. Mark my words.

292
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,700
For what it's worth, I did fuck her.

293
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,800
What is it, Thomas?

294
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,400
I have had a reply to my letter.

295
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,800
From Mistress Boleyn?

296
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,400
What did she say?

297
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,700
That she will not speak to the king on my behalf.

298
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,900
Then our hopes are over.

299
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,600
No. No, no.

300
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,100
I have resolved to write to another lady...

301
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:11,300
...who is far greater, far greater than that mischievous whore.

302
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:17,000
And far more likely to be kind.

303
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,900
Madam, the king is here.

304
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,100
Please. Be seated.

305
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,000
Majesty.

306
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,300
I came because I heard you were unwell.

307
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,800
And that it was necessary for the physician to have bled you.

308
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,200
- How are you feeling now? - I am very well.

309
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,400
Your Majesty is kind to show concern.

310
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,500
How is our daughter?

311
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,800
She writes to me in perfect Latin and tells me she dances the galliards...

312
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,000
...and can play the lute much to everyone's satisfaction and joy.

313
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,800
- You should be proud of her. - I am proud of her.

314
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,600
You ought to invite her to court.

315
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,800
You could watch her dancing and playing.

316
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,000
- It might please you. - Catherine, I...

317
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,600
I hear that several of your agents...

318
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,600
...have been sent abroad to canvass theological opinion about the divorce.

319
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,900
For every scholar that votes for you...

320
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,500
...I could find a thousand who would vote for me.

321
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,600
My lords...

322
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,500
...every day I'm forced to read new reports of dissatisfaction...

323
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,500
...confusion and delays throughout my kingdom.

324
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,800
My exchequer is empty...

325
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,200
...and we are borrowing money at a biting rate.

326
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,800
Your Graces are presidents of this council...

327
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,800
...and yet I hear nothing from you on these matters.

328
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,900
Nor any other matter.

329
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,700
- Your Majesty must forgive me... - Yes, I know. I must always forgive you.

330
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,800
But I grow tired of forgiving you!

331
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:50,700
I have given you everything, including the right to call yourself prince!

332
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,900
And what do I get in return?

333
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,000
I used to think the cardinal vain, self-serving and greedy...

334
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,400
...just as you told me.

335
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:09,900
But now I understand the burden he carried, uncomplainingly.

336
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,600
Your Majesty should not forget that he also stole from you...

337
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,000
...and he served the interests of the French...

338
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,900
...even above those of England.

339
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,000
Is that what you think, Thomas?

340
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,100
It is certainly true that the cardinal was vainglorious beyond measure.

341
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,200
It did him tremendous harm...

342
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,300
...and made him abuse the considerable gifts God gave him.

343
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:46,700
And yet he is a better man than any of you...

344
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,300
...for managing this kingdom's matters.

345
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,800
- I will talk to him. - Yes, you must.

346
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,500
Ambassador Chapuys, Your Majesty.

347
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,600
Ambassador.

348
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,900
- I have a letter for Your Majesty. - From the emperor?

349
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,400
No. From Cardinal Wolsey.

350
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:23,500
This is so strange. Do you know what it says?

351
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,100
The cardinal is offering to create a rapprochement...

352
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,800
...between you and he, the emperor, and Rome.

353
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,500
The coup would be signalled by the arrival of a papal edict...

354
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:40,200
...ordering Henry to leave Anne Boleyn and return to his marriage.

355
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,700
The emperor will offer his financial and moral support...

356
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,000
...and insist that Wolsey be reinstated as chancellor.

357
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,000
Do you think it could work?

358
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,400
The cardinal is nothing if not ingenious.

359
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,000
I want you to set up a new parliament.

360
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,500
Important things need to be done.

361
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,800
My exchequer is empty, for one thing.

362
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,500
I will do as Your Majesty commands.

363
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,600
But I must warn you that you may not find this parliament...

364
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,100
...as compliant as those before.

365
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,500
How so?

366
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,300
Well, though I must confess to being amongst those...

367
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,900
...who called for greater tolerance and freedom of speech...

368
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,600
...I fear that the freedom so given by Your Majesty's kindness...

369
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
...is now openly abused.

370
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,100
There are many dissenting voices in the kingdom...

371
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,900
...chiefly on religious matters.

372
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,600
There are calls for a reformation.

373
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,100
How many have you burned, Thomas?

374
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,000
Six.

375
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,000
All lawful, necessary and well done.

376
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,300
Well done?

377
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,400
Yes, Harry.

378
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,600
What did he say?

379
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,000
Well, in so many words...

380
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,100
...he told me that he was inclined to pardon Wolsey...

381
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,100
...and restore him to royal favour.

382
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,600
And what did you say?

383
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,700
I agreed with His Majesty that the cardinal had many talents.

384
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,300
You did what?

385
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,600
I agreed with the king that His Eminence had many talents.

386
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,000
I cannot believe this.

387
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,200
Have you not spoken yourself...

388
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,900
...of the terrible vengeance he would exact on us...

389
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,900
...if he ever again had the power?

390
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,700
Or perhaps you don't think vengeance to be one of his many talents.

391
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,300
I do indeed.

392
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,700
Which is why I cultivate the king's good graces.

393
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:24,000
Your Majesty will be pleased to know that the University of Paris...

394
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:28,400
...the greatest prize of all, has declared in your favour.

395
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,800
And Italy?

396
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,300
I confess that the universities there are divided.

397
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,700
But Padua, Florence and Venice have all declared for Your Majesty.

398
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,600
Spain? Catherine's country?

399
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,700
Spain is against.

400
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,900
Are you surprised?

401
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,300
And you, my lord.

402
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,200
Did you get to see the emperor and His Holiness?

403
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,900
How are they?

404
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,500
Your Majesty, the emperor refused to see me.

405
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,900
And His Holiness?

406
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:15,700
The pope simply gave me this edict, to bring to Your Majesty.

407
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,200
What does it say?

408
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,200
The edict instructs Your Majesty...

409
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,800
...to order Lady Anne Boleyn to leave your court.

410
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,100
It refuses to allow Your Majesty permission to remarry...

411
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,200
...while the papal curia is deciding Your Majesty's case.

412
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,700
Mr. Wyatt.

413
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,100
- I am busy. - There is someone you should see.

414
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,500
- Not now, Mr. Wyatt. - It concerns the cardinal.

415
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,600
Your Excellency. What can I do for you?

416
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,000
My Lord, I would ask you a very great favour.

417
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,400
These are troubled times.

418
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,500
It seems to me that in certain quarters...

419
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,100
...there is now a blatant and open hostility to our holy Church.

420
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,500
- As we discovered in Germany... - And what do you expect me to do?

421
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,900
I beg you to use the great influence you have here at court...

422
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:29,100
...to pull England back from the brink of catastrophe and ruin.

423
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,100
For the love we all bear for Christ and his apostles.

424
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,200
What apostles?

425
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,400
I don't believe Christ had apostles, not even Saint Peter.

426
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,500
Those men were all charlatans...

427
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,800
...who pretended to follow Christ and speak in his name.

428
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,200
And they built a Church upon their lies.

429
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,900
Mother of God.

430
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,600
Your Honour, Your Honour, so grateful.

431
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,700
Sir, this is Augustus de Augustinis.

432
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,700
A private physician to Thomas Wolsey.

433
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,800
Wolsey? What do you know about him?

434
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:12,600
Sir, I know that Wolsey sought the help of the emperor and the p...

435
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,400
The pope? - Yes, your honour...

436
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,700
...His Holiness the pope. Against His Majesty.

437
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,800
- They communicated? - Yes, yes, yes.

438
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,900
And who else?

439
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,500
Wolsey conspired with Queen Catherine...

440
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,700
...because he said it was the only way that he could be...

441
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,300
- Restored to power. - Yes.

442
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,900
The king must know of this.

443
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,300
Now you know the truth, you must act against him.

444
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,700
He and his fellow priests and prelates...

445
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,400
...think they can control Your Majesty's realm.

446
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,100
That they are higher than you.

447
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,700
And by taking instruction from the pope...

448
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,100
...was not Wolsey acting as an agent of a foreign country?

449
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,700
The presumption of the pope...

450
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:11,000
...thinking he could tell you, you, what to do.

451
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,000
Wolsey, sir. In the name of the king.

452
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,400
- Get up. - Get out of bed.

453
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:37,600
- No, no. - He's done nothing.

454
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,100
Thomas Wolsey, you are arrested by order of the king...

455
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,300
...and charged with high treason.

456
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,000
You will be taken to London, where you will be tried.

457
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,000
- There, there, Joan. - Guards.

458
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:54,000
No tears. No tears for me, I beg you.

459
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,600
Forgive me.

460
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,700
For you have not much to remember me by.

461
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:08,500
No. I have a life and everything in it to remember you by.

462
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,700
Guards, shackle him.

463
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,400
Well, well, Brandon.

464
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,200
If I had served God as diligently as I served the king...

465
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,900
...he would not have given me up in my grey hairs.

466
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,600
Move on.

467
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,900
Joan.

468
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,200
Joan.

469
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,200
I regret to have to inform Your Majesty...

470
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:02,100
...that I can no longer continue to serve the emperor at this court.

471
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:09,600
There is so much hatred here for everything that is sacred and true...

472
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,800
...that those who speak brazenly of it have driven me away.

473
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,600
You are not to blame.

474
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,400
You have always served me with wisdom and kindness.

475
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,900
I will not forget it.

476
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,100
Send my love to my nephew.

477
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,400
I will inform His Highness of your plight...

478
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:41,200
...and of the malice and unkindness of His Majesty towards you.

479
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,600
Yes, tell him.

480
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:52,100
But this also, for the love I bear this country as well as him.

481
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:57,600
He must not think to use force against His Majesty or his people.

482
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:03,700
It would be a sin against my conscience and against God.

483
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:01,700
Lord, we have not spoken as long or as often as we should.

484
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,300
I have often been about other business.

485
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:13,300
If I wanted forgiveness, I should ask for it...

486
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:17,300
...but for all that I have done...

487
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:26,600
...and for all that I am yet to do, there can be no forgiveness.

488
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,900
And yet, I think, I'm not an evil man.

489
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,400
Though evil men pray louder...

490
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,900
...and seek penance...

491
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:58,900
...and think themselves closer to heaven than I am.

492
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,100
I shall not see its gates, Lord.

493
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,400
Nor hear your sweet words of salvation.

494
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:18,200
I have seen eternity, I swear...

495
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,800
...but it was in a dream, and in the morning all was gone.

496
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:41,400
I know myself for what I am.

497
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:48,300
And I throw my poor soul upon your forgiveness...

498
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,600
...in the full knowledge that I deserve none...

499
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,500
...at your loving hands.

500
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,500
Welcome to hell.

501
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:37,960
啊

502
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,600
Mr. Cromwell.

503
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,800
Majesty...

504
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,600
Cardinal Wolsey is dead.

505
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,100
I'm sorry to hear that.

506
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,400
I wish he'd have lived.

507
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,400
How did he die?

508
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,500
Took his own life.

509
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,900
No one must ever know. Do you understand?

510
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:38,700
No one. Never.

511
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,600
I'll finish my game, and we'll talk.

512
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,200
Go.

513
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,900
Go.

514
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,900
Go.

515
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:42,600
Sir Thomas, I have just heard.

516
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,000
By His Majesty's order, 15 senior clergymen...

517
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,000
...have been arrested for recognising Wolsey's authority.

518
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,700
There is also a statute before parliament...

519
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,500
...which recognizes in matters temporal and spiritual...

520
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:59,000
...the king is above the law and shall give account to God alone.

521
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,100
What can be done?

522
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:10,000
I am reminded of something Wolsey once told me.

523
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:15,700
That I should only tell the king what he ought to do not what he could do.

524
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,200
"For if the lion knows his own strength, no man could control him. "

525
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,400
We're standing on the edge of the abyss.

526
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,000
God knows what shall become of us.

527
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,500
I want you.

528
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
- I'm gonna come. - No, you mustn't.

529
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:17,900
Perhaps you could imagine a way to keep his interest more prolonged?
