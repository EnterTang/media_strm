00:00:16,418 --> 00:00:17,713
有请主持人
With your host,

5
00:00:17,713 --> 00:00:20,197
布莱德·梅维尔

6
00:00:24,186 --> 00:00:26,334
晚上好  美国
Good evening, America.

7
00:00:26,334 --> 00:00:27,907
又到了一决舞功的时间
It's dance-off time,

8
00:00:27,917 --> 00:00:30,113
今晚主题是拉丁舞
and the theme is Latin.

9
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,763
一如既往  今夜的挑战者
As always, tonight's challengers

10
00:00:31,763 --> 00:00:33,786
都是经过评委精心选拔出来的
were hand picked by the judges.

11
00:00:33,815 --> 00:00:37,306
麦克斯  你期待看到两位挑战者跳伦巴舞吗
Max, are you looking forward to watching these two Rumba?

12
00:00:37,354 --> 00:00:39,732
我期待桑蒂诺能挽回
I'm looking forward to Santino redeeming himself

13
00:00:39,742 --> 00:00:42,552
上周桑巴风格独舞的失利
for his Samba-inspired solo dance last week.

14
00:00:42,561 --> 00:00:43,568
惨不忍睹
Pathetic.

15
00:00:43,568 --> 00:00:46,225
就像我的狗吃了巴西大餐的剩菜
It was like a terrible dream my dog would have

16
00:00:46,225 --> 00:00:49,630
之后做的噩梦
after eating the leftovers of my Brazilian dinner.

17
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:51,979
大家都见过我们的半决赛选手了
You know our semifinalists.

18
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:55,297
对决阵容是  桑蒂诺对
Our matchup is-- Santino versus...

19
00:00:55,297 --> 00:00:56,698
奥黛特
Odette.

20
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:00,217
傲慢的坏男孩能打败美国甜心吗
Can the arrogant bad boy best America's sweetheart?

21
00:01:00,217 --> 00:01:01,934
让比赛马上开始吧
Let's get right to it.

22
00:01:01,982 --> 00:01:05,003
今夜在桑蒂诺和奥黛特间进行的淘汰赛
Tonight's elimination dance between Santino and Odette

23
00:01:05,003 --> 00:01:07,238
意味着他们中的一个将走到尽头
will mean the end of the road for one of them.

24
00:01:07,238 --> 00:01:10,019
他们中一人将在周一结果揭晓节目中被淘汰
One will be eliminated on Monday's results show.

25
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:13,970
而另一个将晋级总决赛二强
The other will be guaranteed a spot in the final two.

26
00:01:14,037 --> 00:01:15,274
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen--

27
00:01:15,303 --> 00:01:18,382
有请桑蒂诺和奥黛特
Santino and Odette!

28
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:36,191
奥黛特  在吗
Odette, are you in there?

29
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:46,136
猜猜我今天在美容院碰到谁了
Guess who I ran into at the beauty parlor today?

30
00:01:46,136 --> 00:01:47,671
妈妈  我正写到关键地方而且
Mother, I'm at a critical juncture and--

31
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:49,196
乌娜·马可尼
Oona Marconi.

32
00:01:49,196 --> 00:01:50,999
那个剧评家乌娜·马可尼吗
Oona Marconi the theater critic?

33
00:01:50,999 --> 00:01:52,725
我想请她吃饭
I thought I might invite her to dinner.

34
00:01:52,725 --> 00:01:56,158
请她在她的专栏里
Ask her to give a little mention to my acting school,

35
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:58,067
提一提我的表演学校
put it into one of her columns.

36
00:01:58,067 --> 00:01:59,592
这会是非常有效的宣传
It would be invaluable publicity.

37
00:01:59,592 --> 00:02:01,452
是的  但那得看怎么提
Yes, well, that would depend on the mention.

38
00:02:01,452 --> 00:02:04,943
你没忘记她对你在《热铁皮屋顶上的猫》中
You aren't forgetting her blistering review...of your performance

39
00:02:01,452 --> 00:02:04,943
讲述了一个棉花大亨审视自己与身边人关系

40
00:02:04,943 --> 00:02:06,899
饰演的玛吉的刻薄评论吧
of Maggie in "Cat on a hot tin roof", are you?

41
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,069
那是1983年
That was 1983.

42
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:09,268
事情已经过去了
I think I'm over it.

43
00:02:09,268 --> 00:02:11,599
"玛莎·罗杰斯饰演的"小猫"玛吉
"Martha Rodgers as Maggie the cat

44
00:02:09,268 --> 00:02:11,599
主角的妻子

45
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,795
更像一只无助的猫咪
is more of a helpless kitten,

46
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,787
只要不能如愿就又是拍手又是喵喵叫"
mewing and flapping her hands when she doesn't get her way."

47
00:02:16,902 --> 00:02:17,708
你记下来了
You memorized it?

48
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:18,820
没办法
I couldn't help it.

49
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,333
几个月里你都在公寓里走来走去念叨着这句话
You walked around the apartment quoting it for months.

50
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,877
妈妈  我想说的是
Mother, I'm just saying,

51
00:02:22,887 --> 00:02:24,901
也许找一个曾对你不怎么友善的人
maybe it's not a good idea to ask

52
00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:26,656
帮你这么重要的忙
an important favor of someone who's been

53
00:02:26,656 --> 00:02:29,562
不是个好主意
so... unkind to you in the past.

54
00:02:29,562 --> 00:02:32,276
这里的关键词是"曾"
The operative word here is "Past."

55
00:02:32,276 --> 00:02:34,932
我想我可以不受这事的影响
I think I can rise above.

56
00:02:34,932 --> 00:02:35,805
另外  我的表演学校
Besides, my acting school

57
00:02:35,805 --> 00:02:38,087
对我来说比那些陈年旧事重要多了
is more important to me than some old grudge.

58
00:02:38,087 --> 00:02:39,718
这可真成熟  妈妈
Well, that's very mature of you, mother.

59
00:02:39,718 --> 00:02:40,840
谢谢
Thank you.

60
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,947
"如果田纳西·威廉斯知道玛莎·罗杰斯
"If Tennessee Williams knew what crimes Martha Rodgers

61
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,947
《热铁皮屋顶上的猫》的作者

62
00:02:43,947 --> 00:02:45,904
以他的名义对观众犯下的罪行
had committed against this audience in his name,

63
00:02:45,904 --> 00:02:48,704
他会以伤害罪逮捕她"
he would have her arrested for assault."

64
00:02:50,152 --> 00:02:52,089
不受影响
Rising above.

65
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,926
别逗了  卡塞尔  这个剧作家能有多刻薄
Come on, Castle. How mean can this critic be?

66
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,438
我只是怕她是在自寻伤心
I'm just afraid that she's gonna get her heart broken, you know?

67
00:02:58,438 --> 00:02:59,186
你知道我妈妈
I mean, you know my mother.

68
00:02:59,186 --> 00:03:00,817
看外表  坚强自信
On the exterior, she's a tough cookie.

69
00:03:00,817 --> 00:03:03,435
她的虚张声势其实掩藏了
But underneath all that bravado--

70
00:03:03,655 --> 00:03:04,998
她脆弱的心
gooey center.

71
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:06,264
蕾妮
Hey, Lanie.

72
00:03:06,475 --> 00:03:07,664
死者是谁
So who's our victim?

73
00:03:07,664 --> 00:03:08,508
奥黛特·莫顿
Odette Morton.

74
00:03:08,508 --> 00:03:11,030
死因是心脏中一枪
'cause of death is a single G.S.W. to the heart.

75
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,476
可能是9毫米的子弹  她当场死亡
Probably a 9 millimeter. She died instantly.

76
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:14,713
子弹穿透了她的身体
The bullet went right through her.

77
00:03:14,713 --> 00:03:16,967
除非凶手用了消音器
Well, unless our killer used a silencer

78
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:18,214
否则肯定有人听到枪声
someone must have heard the shot.

79
00:03:18,214 --> 00:03:19,547
不一定
Not necessarily.

80
00:03:19,547 --> 00:03:21,724
根据舞台经理说的  开始录制节目时
According to the stage manager, this area clears out

81
00:03:21,724 --> 00:03:22,664
这里就没人了
once taping starts.

82
00:03:22,664 --> 00:03:25,234
另外开幕焰火也会掩盖枪声
Plus the opening pyrotechnics could've covered a gunshot.

83
00:03:25,234 --> 00:03:28,025
那前提是她正好是在节目开场时中枪的
Well, that's assuming that she was shot just as the show started.

84
00:03:28,025 --> 00:03:29,252
看起来就是这样
It looks like she was.

85
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:30,413
是的
Yeah, the, uh,

86
00:03:30,413 --> 00:03:32,925
化妆师在三点差一刻给奥黛特画完妆
makeup girl finished with Odette at 2:45,

87
00:03:32,925 --> 00:03:34,412
三点开始录制节目
Taping starts at 3:00,

88
00:03:34,412 --> 00:03:36,013
三点过四分发现她的尸体
and she was discovered at 3:04.

89
00:03:36,013 --> 00:03:38,047
十九分钟  很短的时间区
19 minutes. That's not a very big window.

90
00:03:38,047 --> 00:03:40,530
去问问有没有员工看见有谁靠近这间房间
All right, see if the crew saw anyone near this room around that time.

91
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,710
没问题
You got it.

92
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,021
莱恩  能给我份今晚被邀请来
Hey, Ryan. Can I get a list of all the guests

93
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:45,038
参与录制的所有来宾
that were invited to tonight's taping

94
00:03:45,038 --> 00:03:46,659
和在保安那里登过记的人员名单吗
along with anyone that checked in at security?

95
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:47,560
已经在统计了
Uh, already on it,

96
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,718
但那不是唯一的入口
but that's not the only way in here.

97
00:03:49,718 --> 00:03:51,703
大厅的走廊尽头还有一个安全出口
There's an exit door to the alley down the hall.

98
00:03:51,703 --> 00:03:52,940
工作人员经常把门开着
The crew guys like to prop it open

99
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,101
好出去抽根烟
so they can go out for a smoke.

100
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:56,307
那么要么凶手碰巧找到了没锁的们
So either our killer got lucky and found an unlocked door...

101
00:03:56,307 --> 00:03:57,649
要么是内部人员作案
Or this was an inside job.

102
00:03:57,649 --> 00:03:58,915
我也认为是这样
That gets my vote.

103
00:03:58,925 --> 00:04:01,246
奥黛特肯定会胜出
Odette was a lock to win this thing.

104
00:04:01,246 --> 00:04:04,286
我打赌是她哪个卑鄙的对手干的
I bet it was one of her backstabbing rivals that did this.

105
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:05,811
怎么啦  我看这个节目
What? I watch the show.

106
00:04:05,811 --> 00:04:07,729
奥黛特是我最喜欢的选手
Odette was my favorite contestant.

107
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:10,165
她是有钱祖父养大的女继承人
She was an heiress raised by her rich grandpa,

108
00:04:10,165 --> 00:04:12,083
一个误入歧途的派对女郎
a party girl headed down the wrong path,

109
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,915
与死亡擦肩而过令她幡然醒悟
then a brush with death made her wake up

110
00:04:13,915 --> 00:04:15,449
改变了她的坏女孩作风
and change her bad-girl ways.

111
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:16,936
故事不错
That's a great story.

112
00:04:16,974 --> 00:04:17,866
就是结局不如人意
Except for the ending.

113
00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:19,161
我得说  帕里什医生
I gotta say, Dr. Parish.

114
00:04:19,161 --> 00:04:21,059
没想到你会是《热舞之夜》的粉丝
I never figured you for a fan of "A night of dance".

115
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:23,246
其实我不是
I'm not exactly.

116
00:04:23,246 --> 00:04:24,445
只是
It's just...

117
00:04:24,924 --> 00:04:26,421
我小时候  最大的梦想就是
When I was young, more than anything,

118
00:04:26,421 --> 00:04:28,128
成为首席芭蕾舞演员
I wanted to be a prima ballerina.

119
00:04:28,128 --> 00:04:30,918
我没跳舞的时候心里也想着跳舞
If I wasn't dancing, I was thinking about dancing.

120
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:31,657
那么发生了什么事
So what happened?

121
00:04:31,657 --> 00:04:33,939
我十三岁的时候开始发育
The girls came along when I was 13.

122
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:36,193
跳芭蕾的没几个是波涛汹涌的
Not that many top-heavy ballerinas out there.

123
00:04:36,203 --> 00:04:37,497
我觉得该多点这样的
Well, I think there should be.

124
00:04:37,497 --> 00:04:38,265
你当然喜闻乐见了
Of course you do.

125
00:04:38,274 --> 00:04:39,876
我不是这个意思
That's not what I meant.

126
00:04:40,327 --> 00:04:41,497
不过呢...
Although...

127
00:04:41,497 --> 00:04:42,791
奥黛特有什么亲属吗
Does Odette have any next of kin?

128
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,594
保罗·莫顿  她的哥哥
Um, Paul Morton, her brother.

129
00:04:44,594 --> 00:04:45,774
好  把他带过来
Okay, great. Bring him down here.

130
00:04:45,774 --> 00:04:47,395
和剩下的选手聊聊
And talk to the rest of the contestants,

131
00:04:47,395 --> 00:04:48,910
我想知道是不是有人
I want to see if anyone is taking this competition

132
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,703
把这场比赛看的太认真了
just a little too seriously.

133
00:04:50,982 --> 00:04:52,065
我们了解到你和奥黛特
We understand that you and Odette

134
00:04:52,065 --> 00:04:54,060
一整天都在排练你们的舞蹈
were rehearsing your dance most of the day.

135
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,125
她看起来怎么样
How did she seem?

136
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,206
她很紧张  我们两个都是
On edge. We both were.

137
00:04:57,254 --> 00:04:58,913
我们之中会有一个人被淘汰
I mean, one of us was about to be eliminated,

138
00:04:58,913 --> 00:05:01,032
所以我不敢相信她彩排到11点就走了
which is why I can't believe she just left rehearsal at 11:00

139
00:05:01,032 --> 00:05:02,126
竟然离开了半个小时
and took off for half an hour.

140
00:05:02,126 --> 00:05:04,130
-去做什么了  -她不说
- To do what? - She wouldn't say.

141
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,058
但是这支舞将决定一切
But everything was riding on this dance.

142
00:05:06,058 --> 00:05:07,630
她告诉我她要去见一个朋友
She told me she had to meet a friend.

143
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:10,134
如果有人找她让我掩护一下
She asked me to cover if anyone was looking for her.

144
00:05:12,406 --> 00:05:13,951
你知道她
Um... do you have any idea

145
00:05:13,951 --> 00:05:15,533
为什么遮遮掩掩的吗
why she was being so secretive?

146
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:18,305
制作人不喜欢我们在演出当天离开演播室
The producers don't like us to leave the studio on show day.

147
00:05:18,305 --> 00:05:19,455
所以一定是重要的事
So it must have been important.

148
00:05:19,455 --> 00:05:21,498
纽约警察局
Well, the NYPD thanks you

149
00:05:21,498 --> 00:05:22,994
感谢你的配合
for your cooperation.

150
00:05:23,982 --> 00:05:25,085
也感谢你
You, too.

151
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:28,969
靠
Damn.

152
00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:30,168
-你看见了吗  -嗯
- Did you see that? - Mm-hmm.

153
00:05:30,168 --> 00:05:31,971
她好像装作我不存在一样
She acted like I didn't even exist.

154
00:05:31,971 --> 00:05:32,978
你确实不存在
You don't.

155
00:05:32,978 --> 00:05:34,743
你带上戒指的那一刻起你就不存在了
Not since you put that ring on your finger.

156
00:05:34,906 --> 00:05:37,581
习惯单身女性把你当隐形人的现实吧
Get used to being invisible to single women.

157
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:43,182
我从来没有见她像过去几个月这么开心过
I've never seen her happier than these past couple months.

158
00:05:43,182 --> 00:05:45,282
我真不敢想象我的妹妹死了
I can't believe that my sister's dead.

159
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:47,459
我们知道她
We understand she had some...

160
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:48,812
过去有一些困难
difficulties in the past.

161
00:05:48,812 --> 00:05:51,008
几年前  我们的祖父去世了
A few years ago, our grandfather passed away,

162
00:05:51,008 --> 00:05:52,542
奥黛特很难接受这个事实
and Odette took it hard.

163
00:05:52,542 --> 00:05:53,674
她退了学
Uh, she quit school,

164
00:05:53,674 --> 00:05:55,621
和一个很好的人分了手
she broke off her relationship with a nice guy,

165
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,309
开始和不正经的人鬼混
started hanging out with a bad crowd.

166
00:05:57,318 --> 00:05:58,316
什么样的不正经人呢
What kind of bad crowd?

167
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,771
派对动物和吸毒的
You know, partiers and druggies.

168
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:02,133
她被逮捕了很多次
She was arrested several times.

169
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:04,741
但是事故过后  她就改过自新了
But after the accident, she left all of that behind.

170
00:06:04,741 --> 00:06:05,892
你是指她差点死掉那次
That was her brush with death?

171
00:06:05,892 --> 00:06:08,203
是去年的一次火车脱轨事件
It was a train derailment last year.

172
00:06:08,203 --> 00:06:09,690
奥黛特在车上
Odette was on board.

173
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,586
她成功得活下来了  但把她吓得不轻
She made it out alive, but it scared the hell out of her.

174
00:06:12,586 --> 00:06:14,082
于是她改变了自己的人生轨迹
She turned her life around.

175
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:17,036
六个月的舞蹈训练  接下来我知道的就是
Six months of dance training, and the next thing that I know,

176
00:06:17,036 --> 00:06:18,475
她试镜了《热舞之夜》
she's auditioned for "A night of dance"

177
00:06:18,475 --> 00:06:19,846
而且被选中了
and been accepted.

178
00:06:19,885 --> 00:06:21,966
她终于找到了人生中的方向
She finally found a direction in life.

179
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:24,411
她差一点就圆了自己的梦
She was so close to realizing her dream.

180
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:25,859
奥黛特生前有没有
Was there anyone in Odette's old life

181
00:06:25,859 --> 00:06:27,509
可能给她带来麻烦的人
that could've come back to cause trouble for her?

182
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:29,149
据我所知没有
Not that I'm aware of.

183
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,901
演出中呢  有没有和她不合的人
What about on the show? Anyone she didn't get along with?

184
00:06:31,901 --> 00:06:33,685
呃  她确实提到了一个人
Uh, uh, she did mention someone,

185
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,095
另外一个选手
another contestant.

186
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:36,994
我记着她说他的名字是艾迪
I think she said his name was Eddie.

187
00:06:40,782 --> 00:06:42,240
贝克特探长  他们在里边等你呢
Detective Beckett, they're waiting for you.

188
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,333
谢谢
Thank you.

189
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:46,028
贝克特探长
Detective Beckett,

190
00:06:46,057 --> 00:06:48,742
做为《热舞之夜》的合作创始人和制作人
as co-creator and executive producer of "Night of Dance"

191
00:06:48,752 --> 00:06:50,353
我已经吩咐我的员工
I have instructed my staff to provide you

192
00:06:50,353 --> 00:06:52,003
为你提供任何你需要
with anything and everything you need

193
00:06:52,003 --> 00:06:53,681
来破这起谋杀案的帮助
to help solve this terrible murder.

194
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:55,628
-任何事  -绝对的
- Anything. - Absolutely anything.

195
00:06:55,628 --> 00:06:56,213
非常感谢
Thanks.

196
00:06:56,213 --> 00:06:58,189
奥黛特告诉她的哥哥剧组里
Now Odette told her brother that there was someone

197
00:06:58,189 --> 00:06:59,972
有个人和她合不来
on the show that she didn't get along with.

198
00:06:59,972 --> 00:07:02,322
艾迪·戈登  但是他已经不在了
Eddie Gordon, but he's not here anymore.

199
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:03,847
上周  艾迪和奥黛特在淘汰赛中
Last week, Eddie and Odette performed

200
00:07:03,847 --> 00:07:06,820
表演了一段受鲍勃·弗希启发的一段舞蹈
a Bob-Fosse-inspired number for the elimination dance-off.

201
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,786
我们投票把艾迪淘汰了
We voted and sent Eddie home.

202
00:07:08,786 --> 00:07:10,340
他很沮丧
He was upset.

203
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,363
-有多沮丧  -你得知道
- How upset? - Well, you have to understand,

204
00:07:12,363 --> 00:07:14,118
所有的参赛者都会在节目中
all the contestants are cast on this show

205
00:07:14,118 --> 00:07:17,091
讲述他们独特但又熟悉的故事
to tell their unique yet familiar stories.

206
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:18,511
奥黛特是个可怜的富家女孩
Odette was the poor little rich girl,

207
00:07:18,511 --> 00:07:21,436
而艾迪却是个贫穷的痞子
and Eddie was the kid from the wrong side of the tracks.

208
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,507
我们选艾迪是为了戏剧效果
We cast Eddie to bring the drama.

209
00:07:23,517 --> 00:07:24,514
艾迪带来了戏剧效果
Eddie brought the drama

210
00:07:24,514 --> 00:07:26,682
而他带来的戏剧效果不光光是镜头前的
and not just for the cameras.

211
00:07:26,701 --> 00:07:28,427
我们让他打包走人的时候他很生气
He was furious when we sent him packing.

212
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:30,489
话讲的相当难听
and we all got an earful about it.

213
00:07:30,489 --> 00:07:31,908
他太无礼了
Oh, and he was so rude.

214
00:07:31,908 --> 00:07:33,031
我不得不叫保安
I had to call security.

215
00:07:33,031 --> 00:07:33,855
他有威胁任何人吗
Was he threatening?

216
00:07:33,855 --> 00:07:37,605
这么说吧  他走了之后我松了一口气
Let's just say, I was relieved when he was gone.

217
00:07:37,711 --> 00:07:38,545
不过真是很讽刺
Ironic, really.

218
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:39,351
为什么
How so?

219
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:40,425
根据赛制
Well, according to the rules,

220
00:07:40,425 --> 00:07:42,813
当一个参赛者不能继续参赛
when a contestant is unable to continue,

221
00:07:42,813 --> 00:07:44,587
上一个被淘汰的舞者会回来
the last eliminated dancer returns

222
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:45,805
代替他或她的位置
to take his or her place.

223
00:07:45,805 --> 00:07:48,586
而那个人就是艾迪·戈登
And that dancer is Eddie Gordon.

224
00:07:48,778 --> 00:07:49,401
让我告诉你一些
Let me tell you something

225
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:51,051
关于单纯可爱小姐奥黛特的事吧
about Miss sweet-and-innocent Odette.

226
00:07:51,051 --> 00:07:52,873
她今天晚上阴我
She threw me under the bus tonight.

227
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,599
她缺席了整整一周的彩排
She blew off rehearsals all week,

228
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,920
她搞错了自己的舞步  还把失误怪在我身上
then messed up her footwork and blames it on me.

229
00:07:57,054 --> 00:07:57,985
知道按我们那儿的规矩
Where I'm from, we know what to do

230
00:07:57,985 --> 00:07:59,452
怎么对付这样撒谎的婊子吗
with lying bitches like that.

231
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:03,403
那是艾迪的临别采访
That was Eddie's exit interview.

232
00:08:03,403 --> 00:08:06,213
制片人鼓励选手们放开了说
The contestants are encouraged by producers to speak freely.

233
00:08:06,367 --> 00:08:07,566
他显然是采纳了他们的意见
He certainly took their advice.

234
00:08:07,566 --> 00:08:09,791
艾迪在罗切斯特有犯罪记录
Eddie has got a record back home in Rochester,

235
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,709
一位《热舞之夜》的助理说
and one of the assistants at "A night of dance"

236
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:13,540
记得在奥黛特被杀的那天下午
says they remember seeing him in the studio

237
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,161
在摄影棚看到了他
the afternoon Odette was murdered.

238
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,252
那么艾迪被淘汰了
Okay, so Eddie was eliminated,

239
00:08:17,261 --> 00:08:18,901
但是他知道如果奥黛特不能参加比赛
but he knew that if Odette was out of the running,

240
00:08:18,901 --> 00:08:20,637
他就会被叫回来代替她的位置
he'd be asked to return and take her slot.

241
00:08:20,637 --> 00:08:23,035
所以他回来"淘汰"奥黛特
So he went back and eliminated Odette...

242
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:24,847
永久地淘汰
Permanently.

243
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,900
灵书妙探
第四季 第十八集

244
00:08:34,604 --> 00:08:35,956
入室抢劫  盗窃
B&E, robbery--

245
00:08:35,966 --> 00:08:38,603
你在罗切斯特还真是忙啊  艾迪
you were pretty busy up in Rochester, Eddie.

246
00:08:38,613 --> 00:08:40,329
没错  但那是很久前的事了
Yeah, but that was a long time ago.

247
00:08:40,406 --> 00:08:42,123
开始跳舞之后我就不过恶棍一样的生活了
When I started dancing, I gave up thug life.

248
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:43,734
但当你被淘汰的时候
Yeah, well, that didn't stop you from going off

249
00:08:43,734 --> 00:08:45,115
你还是对评委态度很恶劣
on the judges when you were eliminated.

250
00:08:45,115 --> 00:08:46,937
淘汰我是他们错误的选择
Me going home was the wrong call

251
00:08:46,937 --> 00:08:47,599
我就是这么说的
and I said so.

252
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:48,481
或许我说出来了
Maybe I said it loud,

253
00:08:48,481 --> 00:08:49,248
但说狠话可不代表我是杀人凶手
but that don't make me no killer.

254
00:08:49,248 --> 00:08:51,157
现在奥黛特不能完成比赛
Now that Odette can't finish the competition,

255
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:53,804
上一个被淘汰的选手会被叫回来参赛
the last eliminated contestant will be asked to return,

256
00:08:53,804 --> 00:08:55,271
那个人就是你  艾迪
and that's you, Eddie.

257
00:08:55,271 --> 00:08:56,173
就像我爸爸曾经说的
Like my daddy used to say,

258
00:08:56,173 --> 00:08:57,832
天道难测
the universe works in mysterious ways.

259
00:08:57,832 --> 00:09:01,438
也许你决定"助天行道"
And maybe you decided to give the universe just a little shove.

260
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:04,238
录制那天你在演播室做什么
So what were you doing at the studio on show day?

261
00:09:04,238 --> 00:09:06,511
我提前过来看我兄弟桑蒂诺
I went by early to see my boy Santino.

262
00:09:06,597 --> 00:09:07,729
为他的大日子鼓鼓劲
Give him support on his big day.

263
00:09:07,729 --> 00:09:09,062
你还真是对答如流  艾迪
You got an answer for everything, don't you, Eddie?

264
00:09:09,062 --> 00:09:09,925
知道你还有什么吗
And you know what else you got?

265
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:11,508
你有动机和动手的机会
You got motive and opportunity.

266
00:09:11,508 --> 00:09:13,464
这事发生时我正在城市的另一头
Man, I was across town when that mess happened,

267
00:09:13,464 --> 00:09:14,577
见我的经纪人
meeting my agent.

268
00:09:14,577 --> 00:09:17,818
但上周  奥黛特确实有些事缠身
But last week, something was going on with Odette...

269
00:09:18,538 --> 00:09:20,609
一些和跳舞无关的事
Something that didn't have nothing to do with dancing.

270
00:09:20,609 --> 00:09:22,920
-什么意思  -她练舞时不在状态
- What do you mean? - She was out of it.

271
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,484
跳错简单的舞步
Missing easy steps,

272
00:09:24,484 --> 00:09:25,692
她说要去洗手间
she'd say she's going to the ladies room,

273
00:09:25,692 --> 00:09:26,967
却一去半小时
and then be gone for half an hour.

274
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:27,927
你觉得她在干什么
What do you think she was doing?

275
00:09:27,927 --> 00:09:29,336
我知道她在干什么
I know what she was doing.

276
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:31,206
我看见她从后门穿出
I saw her go out the back door,

277
00:09:31,456 --> 00:09:33,048
在小巷里和个男人见面
meet some guy in the alley.

278
00:09:33,268 --> 00:09:35,445
他们很严肃地谈了一会儿
They talked real serious for a minute,

279
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:38,112
然后她给了他一卷钞票
then she handed him a roll of bills.

280
00:09:38,313 --> 00:09:39,636
好像有三千
Looked like 3 grand easy.

281
00:09:39,636 --> 00:09:40,941
你有看清楚那个男人吗
You get a good enough look at this guy?

282
00:09:40,941 --> 00:09:43,003
能为我们画幅肖像吗
You think you can provide us with a sketch?

283
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,738
可以  我能办到
Yeah. I can do that.

284
00:09:46,273 --> 00:09:48,153
艾迪·戈登说的是真话
So Eddie Gordon spoke the truth.

285
00:09:48,153 --> 00:09:50,128
奥黛特别杀时  他确实正见经纪人
He was meeting with his agent when Odette was shot.

286
00:09:50,128 --> 00:09:51,404
那他说看见奥黛特在小巷里
So maybe he was also telling the truth

287
00:09:51,404 --> 00:09:53,475
和个男人见面也可能是真话了
about the guy he saw Odette with in the alley.

288
00:09:53,955 --> 00:09:55,067
他为我们画了幅肖像
Well, he gave us a sketch.

289
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:56,468
但是没啥特点
Pretty generic, though.

290
00:09:56,468 --> 00:09:58,108
深发白人帅哥
Handsome, caucasian, dark hair.

291
00:09:58,108 --> 00:10:00,601
可能她在中枪那天
You know, that missing half-hour when Odette left rehearsal

292
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,049
离开排练的半小时
the day she was shot--

293
00:10:02,155 --> 00:10:03,680
就是和他在一起
maybe she was with him.

294
00:10:03,814 --> 00:10:05,732
我会让警员在演播室周围散播肖像
I'll have uniforms circulate the sketch around the studio,

295
00:10:05,732 --> 00:10:07,122
看是否有人能认出他
see if anybody recognizes him.

296
00:10:07,122 --> 00:10:10,259
如果奥黛特在列车事故后回归正道
Okay, so if Odette had straightened up after the train accident,

297
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:11,630
那她在后台门外偷偷
What was she doing behind the stage door

298
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,519
给人一卷钱是为什么
secretly giving some guy a roll of bills?

299
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,517
可能是毒品交易
Could be a drug deal.

300
00:10:14,517 --> 00:10:16,550
也许奥黛特的又犯老毛病了
Maybe Odette was falling back into old habits.

301
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,161
银行账单上有近期的提款记录吗
Any recent withdrawals in her bank statement?

302
00:10:18,161 --> 00:10:20,942
没有那么大的数额  可看看...
Yeah, not for that amount of money, but check out...

303
00:10:21,096 --> 00:10:22,937
这些信用卡支付记录
these credit card payments.

304
00:10:23,254 --> 00:10:25,459
在过去的半年里  奥黛特的信用卡支出
For the last six months, Odette's credit card spending

305
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,445
都很稳定  但大约一个月前
was pretty much steady, and then about a month ago,

306
00:10:27,445 --> 00:10:28,845
它却猛然增加了
it suddenly shot up.

307
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:30,648
可不是  她卡都刷爆了
No kidding. Her cards were maxed out.

308
00:10:30,648 --> 00:10:32,364
花费超过十万美元了
Over 100 grand in charges?

309
00:10:32,364 --> 00:10:34,177
她把这些钱都花哪了
What was she spending all that money on?

310
00:10:34,177 --> 00:10:36,085
谢谢你的到来  林奇伯格先生
Thank you for coming in, Mr. Lynchberg.

311
00:10:36,085 --> 00:10:38,119
你既是奥黛特的业务经理
You were Odette's business manager

312
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:40,420
也是她祖父财产的遗嘱执行人吗
as well as the executor of her grandfather's estate?

313
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,269
很不幸  现在还需
And now I have the unfortunate task

314
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:45,005
处理奥黛特的财产
of handling Odette's estate as well.

315
00:10:45,014 --> 00:10:47,498
那谁会继承她在家族信托中的份额
And who inherits her share of the family trust?

316
00:10:47,498 --> 00:10:48,553
遵照奥黛特的遗嘱
Per Odette's wishes,

317
00:10:48,553 --> 00:10:50,663
份额会归格兰姆·莫顿基金会
it goes to the Graham Morton Foundation.

318
00:10:50,663 --> 00:10:52,686
这是个慈善组织
It's a charitable organization.

319
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:54,442
我留意到上月她的开销
You know, I noticed a pretty big spike

320
00:10:54,442 --> 00:10:55,851
有了非常大的增幅
in her spending over the last month.

321
00:10:55,851 --> 00:10:58,048
-你知道是怎么回事吗  -相信你知道
- Do you have any idea what that was about? - I'm sure you know

322
00:10:58,048 --> 00:11:00,579
自从三年前奥黛特的祖父过世后
that after Odette's grandfather passed away three years ago,

323
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:02,689
她经历了一段黑暗时期
she went through a bad period.

324
00:11:02,689 --> 00:11:03,926
是的  她哥哥已告知我们了
Yeah, her brother filled us in--

325
00:11:03,926 --> 00:11:05,058
开派对  吸毒
parties, drugs.

326
00:11:05,058 --> 00:11:08,185
那时候我尤其关心的就是她的开销
Of particular concern to me during that time was her spending.

327
00:11:08,185 --> 00:11:11,532
她会喝得烂醉  突然就买辆车
Odette would get drunk and spontaneously buy a car

328
00:11:11,532 --> 00:11:14,179
或是投标一间新公寓
or put a bid down on a new apartment.

329
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:15,809
她还会为朋友的隆鼻手术买单
She paid for her friend's nose job--

330
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,650
就是随心所欲  肆意妄为
just whatever struck her fancy.

331
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,712
但在去年列车事故之后
But then after the train accident last year,

332
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,007
一切都停止了
all that stopped.

333
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:24,555
这使关心她的我们都舒了一口气
It was, uh, refreshing to those of us who cared about her.

334
00:11:24,632 --> 00:11:27,289
我当时担心她上月的挥金如土是
I was worried that last month's credit card charges

335
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:29,571
故态复萌的表现
indicated that she might have been backsliding.

336
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,125
她都买了什么
What was she buying?

337
00:11:31,374 --> 00:11:32,841
大部分都是衣服
Clothing mostly.

338
00:11:32,841 --> 00:11:34,923
那两天大部分开销
The bulk of the charges were over two days

339
00:11:34,923 --> 00:11:37,224
都在第五大道的一家百货公司
at one particular 5th Avenue Department Store.

340
00:11:37,224 --> 00:11:39,114
我想看看原始收据
I'd like to see the original receipts.

341
00:11:39,114 --> 00:11:40,044
当然可以
Of course.

342
00:11:40,044 --> 00:11:43,084
这是我见过最奇怪的大血拼了
This is the weirdest spending spree I have ever seen.

343
00:11:43,084 --> 00:11:45,817
奥黛特在衣服上花了上万的美元
Odette spent tens of thousands of dollars on clothes,

344
00:11:45,817 --> 00:11:47,975
但从收据来看  衣服都不是她的尺码
but nothing in her size according to these receipts.

345
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:49,500
所有的衣服都是4号
Everything's in size 4.

346
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,776
而我搜查过她的公寓
And I went through her apartment.

347
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,473
也没看见价值十万的新衣服
I didn't see 100 grand worth of new clothes.

348
00:11:52,473 --> 00:11:53,384
也许她把它们藏起来了
Maybe she hid 'em.

349
00:11:53,384 --> 00:11:55,753
我听着像经典的加油卡诡计
Sounds to me like the old gas card scam.

350
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:56,434
什么意思
What do you mean?

351
00:11:56,434 --> 00:11:58,131
父母对你的零用钱管得非常严
Your parents put you on a strict allowance,

352
00:11:58,131 --> 00:12:00,260
但他们给你张加油卡  好让你替车加油
but they give you a gas card so you can fill your car.

353
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,584
你替朋友的车加油
Well, you fill your friends cars,

354
00:12:01,584 --> 00:12:03,483
然后他们就给你现金
and they give you cash.

355
00:12:03,502 --> 00:12:05,276
我一些在寄宿学校的朋友
Some of my buddies in boarding school

356
00:12:05,276 --> 00:12:08,009
-就这样使零用钱翻了倍  -是嘛
- nearly doubled their allowance. - Uh-huh.

357
00:12:08,115 --> 00:12:09,333
当然不是我
Not me, of course.

358
00:12:10,618 --> 00:12:11,817
那...
That...

359
00:12:13,006 --> 00:12:14,262
可别告诉我妈
Don't tell my mother.

360
00:12:14,377 --> 00:12:16,123
这么说  如果奥黛特急着要现金
So if Odette needed cash in a hurry to,

361
00:12:16,123 --> 00:12:17,571
比如要在小巷里付钱给谁...
say, maybe pay off some guy in an alley...

362
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,489
可每月家族信托所给的津贴
But the monthly stipend from her family trust

363
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,256
并不足以支付
wasn't enough to cover it.

364
00:12:20,256 --> 00:12:22,309
所以她买衣服  再倒卖给朋友
So she charges the clothes, sells them to her friends,

365
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:22,999
周转点现金
in some cash flow.

366
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:23,997
但这些仍不够
Which is still not enough.

367
00:12:24,006 --> 00:12:26,183
但信用卡刷爆  没法换钱了
The card's maxed out, the money train stops,

368
00:12:26,183 --> 00:12:28,322
她不能付款给债主了
and she can't make payment to whoever she owes.

369
00:12:28,322 --> 00:12:29,482
所以她死了
She ends up dead.

370
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,554
可你们真认为奥黛特有个
Yeah, but do you guys think that Odette actually had

371
00:12:31,554 --> 00:12:32,858
穿4码衣服的朋友
one size 4 friend

372
00:12:32,858 --> 00:12:35,850
愿意花十万美元买一堆小脚牛仔裤和
willing to pay 100 grand for a bunch of pegged jeans

373
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,699
一个人造兔毛手提包吗
and a faux rabbit purse?

374
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:40,521
你刚才说兔毛吗
Did you say rabbit?

375
00:12:42,381 --> 00:12:43,657
贾思敏
Jasmine.

376
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,565
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

377
00:12:48,011 --> 00:12:49,162
你是从哪里得到这包的
Where'd you get the bag?

378
00:12:49,162 --> 00:12:49,958
一个朋友给我的
A friend gave it to me.

379
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,723
是你的朋友奥黛特·莫顿吗
Your friend Odette Morton?

380
00:12:52,068 --> 00:12:53,468
我们和售货员谈过了  贾思敏
We talked to the salesperson, Jasmine.

381
00:12:53,468 --> 00:12:54,628
她说奥黛特当时跟你在一起
She said that you were with Odette

382
00:12:54,628 --> 00:12:56,997
给你买了十万块的衣服
when she dropped 100 grand on clothes for you.

383
00:12:56,997 --> 00:12:58,148
奥黛特是个非常慷慨的人
Odette was very generous.

384
00:12:58,148 --> 00:12:59,337
但她死了
She's also very dead,

385
00:12:59,337 --> 00:13:01,390
我一听就知道这是个勒索骗局
and I know a blackmail scheme when I hear one.

386
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,173
也许奥黛特确实遇到了一些
Maybe Odette had something going on in her life

387
00:13:03,173 --> 00:13:04,324
不想让别人知道的事
she wanted to keep secret.

388
00:13:04,324 --> 00:13:05,715
可是被你发现了
You found out about it and told her

389
00:13:05,715 --> 00:13:08,045
想要封住你的口  就得跟你买一整柜衣服
that the price for your silence was a closet full of fancy duds.

390
00:13:08,045 --> 00:13:09,033
那我为何杀她呢
But why would I kill her?

391
00:13:09,033 --> 00:13:11,383
也许她不能继续满足你了  你很失望
Maybe she couldn't give anymore, you got frustrated,

392
00:13:11,383 --> 00:13:11,997
然后就杀了她
you killed her.

393
00:13:11,997 --> 00:13:13,646
又或者她决定公开秘密
Maybe she decided to come forward herself,

394
00:13:13,646 --> 00:13:14,605
告你勒索
accuse you of blackmail,

395
00:13:14,605 --> 00:13:15,296
然后你杀了她
you killed her.

396
00:13:15,296 --> 00:13:16,974
贾思敏  我能想到的情节多了去了
Jasmine, these are just off the top of my head.

397
00:13:16,984 --> 00:13:19,832
-我们回警局再说吧  -等等
- We can finish off this conversation at the precinct. - Wait.

398
00:13:23,265 --> 00:13:24,992
上个月  我有天很晚下班
Last month, I was here working late,

399
00:13:24,992 --> 00:13:27,255
正好撞见奥黛特匆忙从我的位置旁经过
and I happened to see Odette walk by my desk real fast,

400
00:13:27,255 --> 00:13:28,684
一脸苦闷  然后我看到
like she was upset. Next thing I know,

401
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:30,851
布莱德·梅维尔出现了  好像是来找她
here comes Brad Melville, like he's looking for her.

402
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,856
布莱德·梅维尔  节目的主持吗
Brad Melville, the show's host?

403
00:13:32,856 --> 00:13:34,352
《热舞之夜》的主持人来找
Why would the host of "A Night of Dance"

404
00:13:34,352 --> 00:13:35,407
一个参赛选手干嘛
be looking for a contestant?

405
00:13:35,407 --> 00:13:36,577
主持和选手不是禁止有交情吗
Aren't they not supposed to fraternize?

406
00:13:36,577 --> 00:13:37,977
所以我跟了上去
That's why I followed him.

407
00:13:37,977 --> 00:13:39,857
布莱德和奥黛特在楼梯间吵了一架
Brad and Odette were in the stairwell having a fight.

408
00:13:39,857 --> 00:13:40,566
吵了些什么
About what?

409
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:41,938
我不是很清楚
I'm not completely sure.

410
00:13:41,938 --> 00:13:42,993
不过我吓唬奥黛特
But when I bluffed Odette

411
00:13:43,002 --> 00:13:44,642
要把她跟布莱德的事告诉麦克斯时
that I was going to tell Max about her and Brad,

412
00:13:44,652 --> 00:13:45,534
她特别紧张
she got really nervous.

413
00:13:45,544 --> 00:13:48,402
她说她可以给我点好处  让我别说出去
She offered to buy me some stuff I wanted if I'd keep quiet.

414
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,118
我觉得这交易不错
And I thought that sounded like a good deal.

415
00:13:50,128 --> 00:13:52,564
但事情到此为止  我绝不会伤害奥黛特的
But that's it. I would've never hurt Odette.

416
00:13:52,564 --> 00:13:55,211
不好意思  你这话实在让人难以相信
You'll have to pardon me if I don't take you at your word.

417
00:13:55,221 --> 00:13:57,206
如果说有谁想杀奥黛特
Look, if anyone had a reason to murder Odette,

418
00:13:57,206 --> 00:13:57,877
肯定就是布莱德
it was Brad.

419
00:13:57,877 --> 00:14:00,313
我有录音为证
Just listen. I recorded the two of them.

420
00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:02,615
我们明明说好了的
We had a deal.

421
00:14:02,615 --> 00:14:04,389
如果你不说出去  我也不说
And I'm willing to stand by it if you are.

422
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:06,125
我辛辛苦苦才爬到现在这个位置
I have worked too hard to get where I am.

423
00:14:06,134 --> 00:14:07,726
如果别人知道这事  奥黛特
If anyone finds out about this, Odette,

424
00:14:07,726 --> 00:14:09,347
你就死定了
I swear, I'll kill you.

425
00:14:10,968 --> 00:14:12,924
麦克斯·兰弗罗要是发现布莱德·梅维尔
If Max Renfro found out that Brad Melville

426
00:14:12,924 --> 00:14:14,584
跟某个选手有来往
was in a relationship with one of the contestants,

427
00:14:14,584 --> 00:14:15,207
他会怎么做
what would happen?

428
00:14:15,207 --> 00:14:16,626
选手会被开除
She'd be thrown off the show,

429
00:14:16,626 --> 00:14:18,113
主持人也是
and he'd be fired.

430
00:14:18,122 --> 00:14:20,156
足够作为谋杀动机了  谁有异议不
Motive for murder, anyone?

431
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,033
如果有别人知道这事  奥黛特
If anyone finds out about this, Odette,

432
00:14:23,033 --> 00:14:24,567
你就死定了
I swear, I'll kill you.

433
00:14:24,711 --> 00:14:26,370
事情不是你们听到的那样
That is completely not what it sounds like.

434
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,212
布莱德  我们听到的是  在奥黛特
What it sounds like, Brad, is you threatening

435
00:14:28,212 --> 00:14:30,523
死前数周  你威胁过奥黛特·莫顿
Odette Morton's life a few weeks before she was murdered.

436
00:14:30,523 --> 00:14:32,096
可我当初是想要保护她
But I was trying to protect her.

437
00:14:32,096 --> 00:14:33,525
怎么个保护法
Protect her how?

438
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:35,999
我知道奥黛特有过一段麻烦史
I knew about Odette's troubled past--

439
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:37,495
总是嗑药  酒后驾车
the drugs, the D.U.I.s.

440
00:14:37,495 --> 00:14:39,826
可她说现在都戒了  还说跳舞
But I also believed her when she said she was clean now

441
00:14:39,826 --> 00:14:41,552
是她最在乎的事情  我也信过她
and that dancing was all she cared about.

442
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:43,134
你是想说她在撒谎吗
Are you trying to say that that wasn't true?

443
00:14:43,134 --> 00:14:44,515
我想说的是
What I'm trying to say is,

444
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:47,028
两个月前  我有一天很早就去化妆
two months ago, I walked into makeup early one morning,

445
00:14:47,028 --> 00:14:49,061
结果发现奥黛特在注射毒品
and found Odette shooting up.

446
00:14:51,286 --> 00:14:52,140
你确定吗
Are you sure about this?

447
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,722
百分之百确定
100% positive.

448
00:14:53,722 --> 00:14:55,103
要是让麦克斯知道这事
If Max knew she was using,

449
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,676
她肯定会被当场淘汰
she would've been eliminated on the spot.

450
00:14:56,676 --> 00:14:58,258
可你没告诉麦克斯
But you never told max.

451
00:14:58,258 --> 00:14:59,879
奥黛特发誓她会戒掉
Odette promised she would clean up.

452
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:03,063
我就给了她一次机会  但我一直有留意她
I gave her a second chance, but I also kept an eye on her.

453
00:15:03,063 --> 00:15:04,952
然后一个月前  她又被我抓了现行
Then a month ago, I caught her again.

454
00:15:04,952 --> 00:15:07,590
我跟她说我没法再帮她了  我得告诉麦克斯
I told her I was going to max, that she was on her own.

455
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,184
麦克斯知道了吗
And did you?

456
00:15:08,184 --> 00:15:10,879
没有  因为奥黛特威胁我
No, because Odette threatened me.

457
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:13,478
她说如果我去麦克斯那里告密
She said that if I went to max and told him what I'd seen,

458
00:15:13,478 --> 00:15:15,444
她就要告诉麦克斯
that she'd go to him and tell him that I was the one

459
00:15:15,444 --> 00:15:16,902
我第一次放过了她
that let her off the first time.

460
00:15:16,902 --> 00:15:18,110
麦克斯肯定会因为
Max would've fired me

461
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,827
我隐瞒了这么大秘密而开除我的
for keeping a secret that big from him.

462
00:15:19,827 --> 00:15:21,256
我就做不了节目了
I'd be off the show.

463
00:15:21,256 --> 00:15:23,289
我就成了布莱恩·邓克曼
I'd be Brian Dunkleman.

464
00:15:21,256 --> 00:15:23,289
2002年第一季美国偶像的主持之一  季终后辞职
因后来节目大红  评论称其毁掉了自己的职业生涯

465
00:15:24,037 --> 00:15:25,150
布莱恩·邓克曼是谁
Who's Brian Dunkleman?

466
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,358
看吧  没人知道他
Exactly.

467
00:15:26,435 --> 00:15:29,676
就是说如果奥黛特被开除  她就要拉你当垫背
So... if Odette went down, she was taking you with her.

468
00:15:30,942 --> 00:15:32,419
布莱德说的没错
Brad was right about her shooting up.

469
00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:34,050
在她的珠宝箱的活底层里
Found these hidden in a false bottom

470
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,968
找到了这玩意儿  怪不得鉴证组
underneath her jewelry box. No wonder C.S.U. missed it.

471
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,742
-搜她公寓的时候没找到  -有可能是兴奋剂
- when they went through her apartment. - Could be speed.

472
00:15:37,742 --> 00:15:39,545
可我刚跟蕾妮通过电话
Yeah, except I just got off the phone with Lanie,

473
00:15:39,545 --> 00:15:41,779
她说毒理检验报告显示
and she said that preliminary tox screen results show

474
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:43,122
奥黛特没有吸毒
that Odette wasn't using drugs,

475
00:15:43,122 --> 00:15:45,980
至少不是常见的毒品
at least none of the usual ones.

476
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:49,068
这针管里头到底是什么东西
So what the hell is in this bottle?

477
00:15:53,074 --> 00:15:56,412
然后我跟劳伦斯爵士说  "拉瑞  这是
And so I said to Sir Laurence, "Larry, that is

478
00:15:53,074 --> 00:15:56,412
指劳伦斯·奥利弗爵士  著名英国演员  费雯·丽的丈夫

479
00:15:56,412 --> 00:15:59,740
这是我见过演《奥赛罗》的第二棒的演出
the second best performance of 'Othello' I have ever seen.

480
00:15:59,903 --> 00:16:01,955
但是没有人能够超越
But I'm afraid no one can improve

481
00:16:01,955 --> 00:16:04,219
奥森·威尔斯的表演"
the Orson Welles interpretation."

482
00:16:01,955 --> 00:16:04,219
自编自导自演《公民凯恩》的电影天才

483
00:16:04,219 --> 00:16:05,302
"拉瑞"  我对他说
"Larry," I said,

484
00:16:05,302 --> 00:16:07,144
"你就是没他演得好"
"You've simply been outdone."

485
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,213
呃  那奥利弗怎么回答的
Wow. What did, uh, Olivier say to that?

486
00:16:10,222 --> 00:16:11,133
他说...
He said...

487
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:12,418
"亲爱的
"My dear girl,

488
00:16:12,553 --> 00:16:15,209
你还真有戏剧评论家的天赋"
you have the makings of a theater critic."

489
00:16:15,698 --> 00:16:17,329
于是我就成了评论家
And so here I am.

490
00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:19,371
是啊  你确实有天赋
Yes, indeed, you are.

491
00:16:19,371 --> 00:16:20,359
噢对了
Oh, by the way,

492
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:23,476
不知道你最近听说没
I don't know if I told you that recently,

493
00:16:23,476 --> 00:16:27,216
我开了一家表演学校
I opened my own acting school.

494
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:28,732
玛莎
Martha.

495
00:16:28,732 --> 00:16:30,285
太棒了
How wonderful.

496
00:16:30,285 --> 00:16:31,168
谢谢
Thank you.

497
00:16:31,168 --> 00:16:32,549
你能把你
How good of you to share

498
00:16:32,549 --> 00:16:35,896
"多年"的表演经验
your years and... years of experience

499
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:37,679
跟下一代分享真是太好了
with a new generation.

500
00:16:38,408 --> 00:16:40,662
是啊  我们都为她感到自豪
Yes, we are very proud.

501
00:16:40,739 --> 00:16:41,573
我在想
And I was wondering,

502
00:16:41,573 --> 00:16:43,673
或许你可以赏脸来我的学校
perhaps you might consider stopping by

503
00:16:43,673 --> 00:16:45,678
旁听一两堂课
and sitting in on a class or two,

504
00:16:45,678 --> 00:16:47,682
如果觉得还不错的话
and then if you felt so inclined,

505
00:16:47,682 --> 00:16:50,195
在你那个出色的专栏里
mentioning our little school

506
00:16:50,195 --> 00:16:53,101
提几句我学校的事
in one of your wonderful columns.

507
00:16:53,609 --> 00:16:55,115
我乐意之至
I'd be happy to do that.

508
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:57,282
你把时间地点告诉我就好
You just tell me where and when.

509
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,287
那太好了
Well, that's lovely.

510
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:02,442
希望你别把你那个在说重要台词前
I just hope you're not teaching your students

511
00:17:02,442 --> 00:17:04,130
把头往一边倾斜的
your little trick of tilting your head

512
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,199
小动作教给学生们
before delivering an important line of dialogue.

513
00:17:07,928 --> 00:17:08,982
我哪有这个动作
I don't do that.

514
00:17:08,982 --> 00:17:11,371
你演"小猫"玛吉的时候就是这样的
Well, you did it when you played Maggie the cat.

515
00:17:11,524 --> 00:17:14,411
对了  你双手还会像小鸟振翅那样抖动
Oh, and you fluttered your hands like little bird wings.

516
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,029
我一直等着你飞起来呢
I kept waiting for you to take off.

517
00:17:17,988 --> 00:17:19,014
谁要吃派吗
Who wants pie?

518
00:17:19,024 --> 00:17:19,858
阿丽克西斯  你能不能
Alexis, would you--

519
00:17:19,858 --> 00:17:21,076
谢谢
Thank you.

520
00:17:21,076 --> 00:17:25,603
我记得那年我获得了托尼奖的提名
I believe that was the year that I was nominated for a Tony.

521
00:17:25,603 --> 00:17:27,492
也许比起我  美国戏剧协会
Well, perhaps the American Theatre Wing

522
00:17:27,492 --> 00:17:32,364
对于歪头和乱挥手更宽容一些
is more tolerant of head tilting and hand fluttering than I am.

523
00:17:32,997 --> 00:17:35,749
玛莎  我只是在开玩笑
Oh, Martha, I'm just teasing.

524
00:17:35,826 --> 00:17:39,528
你不会还在为以前的那则评论生气吧
You can't possibly still be upset about that old review.

525
00:17:39,902 --> 00:17:42,098
咱们别说会觉得后悔的话
Let's not say anything we'll regret.

526
00:17:42,338 --> 00:17:44,678
那就不叫评论  那是诽谤
That was no review. That was a hatchet job.

527
00:17:44,678 --> 00:17:47,037
根本就是毫无理由的恶意诽谤
It was vicious and it was uncalled for.

528
00:17:47,037 --> 00:17:49,723
不过那的确是大实话
And it was also accurate.

529
00:17:50,461 --> 00:17:52,206
别受影响
Rise above.

530
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:55,064
知道吗  乌娜  我撤回我的邀请
You know what, Oona? I rescind my request.

531
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,622
我现在绝不会接受你对我学校的赞扬
There is no way I would accept your endorsement of my school now

532
00:17:58,622 --> 00:17:59,984
哪怕你求我
if you begged me.

533
00:17:59,984 --> 00:18:01,730
没可能
Fat chance of that.

534
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,636
你记住  玛莎
Just remember, Martha,

535
00:18:04,664 --> 00:18:07,752
演不利者  从教
those who can't do teach.

536
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:11,042
教不利者
And those who can't teach

537
00:18:11,042 --> 00:18:12,903
评
become theater critics.

538
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,599
奶奶
Gram.

539
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:22,618
本可能更糟的
Could've been worse.

540
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:24,689
糟到极致了
It couldn't have been worse.

541
00:18:24,689 --> 00:18:26,176
我妈妈敞开心扉
My mother exposed her gooey center,

542
00:18:26,176 --> 00:18:27,959
乌娜·马可尼却扎了把刀子上去
and Oona Marconi drove a stake through it.

543
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:29,273
帮我转告她  我深表同情
Well, tell her, I feel her pain.

544
00:18:29,273 --> 00:18:31,431
谢了  我会的  案子有什么进展吗
Thanks. I will. Anything new on the case?

545
00:18:31,431 --> 00:18:34,481
警员找到了奥黛特遇害当天上午11点
Yeah, unis found the cafe that Odette went to at 11:00 a.m.

546
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:35,785
她去过的咖啡馆
the day that she was killed.

547
00:18:35,785 --> 00:18:37,214
是去和神秘男子交易毒品吗
Scoring drugs off her mystery man?

548
00:18:37,214 --> 00:18:40,369
是去喝杯脱脂拿铁
More like scoring a fat-free latte.

549
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,064
她约了个朋友喝咖啡
She met up with a friend for coffee.

550
00:18:43,429 --> 00:18:44,426
苏珊·斯坦纳
Suzanne Steiner.

551
00:18:44,426 --> 00:18:45,567
朋友
A friend?

552
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:48,032
录制日擅自离开可是件大事
Leaving the studio on show day was a very big deal.

553
00:18:48,032 --> 00:18:49,557
有什么重要的事这么刻不容缓
What was so important that it couldn't wait?

554
00:18:49,557 --> 00:18:51,667
苏珊说  她只是想叙叙旧
According to Suzanne, she just wanted to talk about old times.

555
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:53,259
实验室发来份传真
Hey, we got a fax from the lab.

556
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:56,443
我们在奥黛特公寓找到的小瓶清澈液体
That clear vial of liquid that we found at Odette's apartment?

557
00:18:56,443 --> 00:18:57,517
不是违禁药品
It wasn't illegal drugs.

558
00:18:57,517 --> 00:18:58,610
是胰岛素
It's insulin.

559
00:18:58,610 --> 00:18:59,531
奥黛特有糖尿病吗
Odette was diabetic?

560
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:00,778
她医生说没有
Not according to her doctor.

561
00:19:00,778 --> 00:19:02,542
他说已经一年多没见过她了
He said he hasn't seen her in over a year.

562
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,144
也许她是最近患上的
Well, maybe she developed it recently

563
00:19:04,154 --> 00:19:05,535
有或者她换了个医生
or maybe she went to a new doctor.

564
00:19:05,535 --> 00:19:07,251
那为什么不直接告诉布莱德·梅维尔实情呢
Then why not just tell Brad Melville the truth,

565
00:19:07,251 --> 00:19:09,064
那并不是甲基苯丙胺[一种兴奋剂]只是胰岛素
that it wasn't speed, it was insulin?

566
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:13,236
何必要贿赂贾思敏呢
And why bother buying Jasmine half of 5th Avenue to keep it quiet?

567
00:19:14,646 --> 00:19:15,883
我想我知道答案
Well, I think I can help with that.

568
00:19:15,883 --> 00:19:17,858
奥黛特家的鉴证报告出来了
C.S.U. report is back on Odette's place.

569
00:19:17,858 --> 00:19:19,249
他们只发现了一组指纹
They only found one set of prints

570
00:19:19,249 --> 00:19:21,330
却不属于奥黛特
and they were not Odette's.

571
00:19:21,531 --> 00:19:23,824
是一个叫芭芭拉·兰戴尔的女人的
They belong to a woman named Barbra Landau.

572
00:19:23,824 --> 00:19:25,291
芭芭拉·兰戴尔又是谁
Who the hell is Barbra Landau?

573
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,276
是个不该跟奥黛特有交集的人
Not someone who would run in Odette's circles.

574
00:19:27,276 --> 00:19:29,069
她在寄养家庭长大
She was raised in foster care

575
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:30,057
高中辍学
and was a high school dropout.

576
00:19:30,057 --> 00:19:31,688
那她是和奥黛特一起住吗
So she was staying with Odette?

577
00:19:31,688 --> 00:19:32,762
我们得和她谈谈
We need to talk to her.

578
00:19:32,762 --> 00:19:33,836
八成是没戏了
That's gonna be tough.

579
00:19:33,836 --> 00:19:36,512
据官方记录  芭芭拉·兰戴尔已经去世一年多了
Officially, Barbra Landau has been dead for over a year.

580
00:19:36,512 --> 00:19:38,075
这是她的死亡证明
Here's her death certificate.

581
00:19:38,228 --> 00:19:39,609
她在一场火车相撞事故中
She died of blunt force trauma

582
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:41,806
被钝器砸中致死
from injuries suffered in a train collision.

583
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:42,486
是的
That's right.

584
00:19:42,496 --> 00:19:45,555
正是奥黛特幸存的那次火车事故
The same train collision that Odette survived.

585
00:19:46,332 --> 00:19:47,800
可她真的幸存了吗
Or did she?

586
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,401
看到奥黛特的照片了吗
You see that picture of Odette?

587
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:50,984
这张是...
Well, this...

588
00:19:51,837 --> 00:19:53,093
芭芭拉
is Barbra.

589
00:19:55,117 --> 00:19:56,143
一模一样
They're identical.

590
00:19:56,143 --> 00:19:57,438
不可能
But that's impossible.

591
00:19:57,438 --> 00:19:58,378
不可能吗
Impossible

592
00:19:58,378 --> 00:20:00,756
这或许是所有问题的答案
or the explanation to everything?

593
00:20:00,842 --> 00:20:03,365
事故以后奥黛特发生了巨大的改变
The dramatic change in Odette after the accident,

594
00:20:03,374 --> 00:20:05,331
还隐藏自己的糖尿病史
the need to hide being a diabetic,

595
00:20:05,331 --> 00:20:07,748
因为奥黛特没有糖尿病
because Odette was not a diabetic...

596
00:20:08,285 --> 00:20:10,548
奥黛特·莫顿并没在事故中幸存
Odette Morton didn't survive that train crash.

597
00:20:10,548 --> 00:20:11,660
活下来的是芭芭拉
Barbra did.

598
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,636
如凤凰从灰烬中涅盘
And like a phoenix rising from the ashes,

599
00:20:13,636 --> 00:20:16,101
芭芭拉·兰戴尔从火车残骸里爬出来
Barbra Landau walked away from the wreckage of that train

600
00:20:16,101 --> 00:20:19,131
继而偷走了奥黛特·莫顿的生活
and stole Odette Morton's life.

601
00:20:23,364 --> 00:20:26,097
双胞胎姐妹出生后被领养
Twin girls are born and put up for adoption.

602
00:20:26,164 --> 00:20:28,437
奥黛特被有钱人家收养了
Odette goes to a wealthy, loving family.

603
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:30,230
芭芭拉就没那么幸运了
Barbra--not so lucky.

604
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,523
她辗转于寄养家庭之间
She gets bounced around from one foster home to the next,

605
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,163
可内心深处她一直知道
always knowing deep inside

606
00:20:34,163 --> 00:20:36,033
她注定能过上更好的生活
that she was meant for something better.

607
00:20:36,033 --> 00:20:39,974
然后有一天  她们在开往迈阿密的火车上相遇
Then one day, the two of them meet on a train bound for Miami.

608
00:20:39,974 --> 00:20:41,566
姐妹之情一触即发
The connection is instantaneous.

609
00:20:41,566 --> 00:20:43,820
在接下来的两天里  她们了解了彼此的一切
In two days, they learn everything there is to know about each other,

610
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,942
芭芭拉忍不住地想
And Barbra can't help but think,

611
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:48,539
假如当初我也像奥黛特那样进入富人家
If only I had landed in the lap of luxury like Odette,

612
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,457
我想干什么都行了
I could've been anything I wanted to be.

613
00:20:51,176 --> 00:20:54,139
你是说芭芭拉为了夺走奥黛特的生活
Are you suggesting that Barbra purposefully caused the derailment

614
00:20:54,139 --> 00:20:55,664
制造了脱轨事故吗
to take over Odette's life?

615
00:20:55,664 --> 00:20:57,956
怎么办到的  用巫术吗
With what, her crazy wiccan powers?

616
00:20:59,356 --> 00:21:01,083
那就会是个惊人大逆转了
Wow, that would be an incredible twist,

617
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,310
不是  当然不是
But no, no.

618
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,567
事故就是事故
The accident happens.

619
00:21:03,567 --> 00:21:05,274
奥黛特遇害
Odette is killed.

620
00:21:05,274 --> 00:21:06,521
芭芭拉幸存
Barbra survives.

621
00:21:06,521 --> 00:21:09,417
混乱之中
And in the midst of all the chaos and rubble,

622
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:11,671
她看到了机会
she sees her chance.

623
00:21:11,997 --> 00:21:14,202
她跟奥黛特换了身份
She switches identification with Odette,

624
00:21:14,202 --> 00:21:16,034
改变了自己的命运
and she changes her destiny.

625
00:21:16,034 --> 00:21:18,604
仅用一步  芭芭拉就为自己
In one move, Barbra builds herself

626
00:21:18,614 --> 00:21:21,501
建立了一个更美好的未来和完美人生
a better future, a perfect life.

627
00:21:21,894 --> 00:21:23,237
直到一年后还是被害了
Until she was murdered a year later.

628
00:21:23,237 --> 00:21:25,088
"失散多年的双胞胎"这种故事
Yeah, well, separated twin stories

629
00:21:25,097 --> 00:21:25,874
从来不会有好结局
never end happily,

630
00:21:26,258 --> 00:21:27,811
除了《天生一对》
except "The Parent Trap."

631
00:21:27,811 --> 00:21:28,809
血液报告来了
Blood tests are back.

632
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,084
奥黛特和芭芭拉
Odette and Barbra

633
00:21:30,084 --> 00:21:31,897
并没有血缘关系
were not biologically related.

634
00:21:31,906 --> 00:21:34,035
我们也找不到芭芭拉在世的家人
And Barbra has no living family we could find.

635
00:21:34,035 --> 00:21:35,531
如果她们不是姐妹
If they're not related,

636
00:21:35,531 --> 00:21:37,450
怎么可能长得这么像
how can Barbra look so much like Odette?

637
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,092
我也不知道
I don't know.

638
00:21:38,092 --> 00:21:41,084
不过我们查到了她之前工作的地方
But we do have an address for her former place of employment,

639
00:21:41,084 --> 00:21:42,063
是个市中心的脱衣舞俱乐部
a strip club in midtown.

640
00:21:42,063 --> 00:21:43,520
我们之前办案的思路是
See, we've been operating under the theory

641
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,726
奥黛特因为她自己惹的事被害
that Odette was murdered because she was Odette.

642
00:21:45,726 --> 00:21:47,989
但如果她是因为她的真实身份而遇害呢
But what if she was murdered because she was really Barbra?

643
00:21:47,989 --> 00:21:49,898
查明芭芭拉的底细
Find out everything you can about Barbra.

644
00:21:49,898 --> 00:21:50,665
与此同时
In the meantime,

645
00:21:50,665 --> 00:21:53,082
我要再询问一遍奥黛特的哥哥保罗
I'm gonna reinterview Odette's brother Paul.

646
00:21:53,082 --> 00:21:54,194
他现在成了嫌犯吗
Is he a person of interest now?

647
00:21:54,194 --> 00:21:56,669
我只是不能相信芭芭拉
I'm just having trouble believing that Barbra managed

648
00:21:56,669 --> 00:21:59,162
能瞒住奥黛特的哥哥一年多
to fool Odette's own brother for over a year.

649
00:21:59,162 --> 00:22:01,138
他得让我相信他不知情
He's gonna have to convince me that he didn't know.

650
00:22:01,138 --> 00:22:03,257
听起来这工作更适合
Well, that sounds like something better done

651
00:22:03,257 --> 00:22:04,629
一对一死磕
one-on-one, mano a mano.

652
00:22:04,629 --> 00:22:06,643
而我想和他们一起去市中心走一趟
Meantime, I want to take a ride downtown with the boys,

653
00:22:06,652 --> 00:22:08,446
-去脱衣舞俱乐部溜溜  -抱歉了 卡塞尔
- check out that strip club. - Sorry, Castle.

654
00:22:08,446 --> 00:22:09,740
人已经满了
Three's a crowd.

655
00:22:14,478 --> 00:22:15,792
怎么了  为什么不让卡塞尔去
What's up? Why you freezing out our boy like that?

656
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:16,952
我想做个实验
I want to try an experiment.

657
00:22:16,952 --> 00:22:19,024
和卡塞尔一起去会搞砸的
Having Castle along would mess things up.

658
00:22:20,242 --> 00:22:21,335
给你
Here.

659
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:22,803
戴上我的婚戒
Wear my wedding ring.

660
00:22:22,803 --> 00:22:24,960
干啥呢  把那东西给我拿走
What? Get that thing away from me, man.

661
00:22:25,066 --> 00:22:25,632
这东西很扫兴
It's a mood killer.

662
00:22:25,632 --> 00:22:26,802
我们在夜总会时你就戴着它吧
Just wear it when we're at the club.

663
00:22:26,802 --> 00:22:27,387
为什么
What for?

664
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:28,845
我已经和所有已婚男性朋友交流过了
See, I been talking to all my married guy friends,

665
00:22:28,845 --> 00:22:30,791
他们说你的那套理论是胡扯
they say that your theory is way off.

666
00:22:30,801 --> 00:22:32,048
戴着婚戒
Wearing a wedding ring

667
00:22:32,048 --> 00:22:34,186
可以让男人更受女人关注  而不是相反
gets them more attention from women, not less.

668
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,574
-所以呢  -所以你把它戴上
- So? - So wear the ring.

669
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,608
我想看看女人会不会继续跟你调情
I want to see if women still flirt with you

670
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:39,950
同时无视我
and ignore me.

671
00:22:40,689 --> 00:22:41,983
那你不希望卡塞尔来的原因是
So you didn't want Castle to come because...

672
00:22:41,983 --> 00:22:43,719
所有的女人都会和他调情
All the women would flirt with him.

673
00:22:44,803 --> 00:22:45,867
我想知道是不是只是婚戒的原因
I want to know if it's just the ring

674
00:22:45,867 --> 00:22:47,412
让女人们都敬而远之
that's repelling members of the fairer sex.

675
00:22:47,421 --> 00:22:50,030
和婚戒无关  老兄  是你自身原因
It's not the ring, bro. It's you.

676
00:22:50,317 --> 00:22:51,679
当你结婚了一阵子
See, once you've been married for a little while

677
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,086
你会感到一丝乏味和不满
and you're feeling a little bored and unsatisfied,

678
00:22:54,086 --> 00:22:56,599
婚戒会让你得到女人们的爱慕
The ring will get you love from the ladies.

679
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:58,134
她们想让你脱离苦海
They'll want to take you away from all that

680
00:22:58,134 --> 00:23:00,157
好让你娶她们  然后再一起享受乏味和不满
so that you can be bored and unsatisfied with them.

681
00:23:00,157 --> 00:23:01,414
那现在为何不是这样
Why not now?

682
00:23:01,768 --> 00:23:03,686
因为现在你沉浸在和妻子
Cause now you're all blissfully happy

683
00:23:03,686 --> 00:23:05,317
以及新婚的幸福中
with your wife and whatnot.

684
00:23:05,326 --> 00:23:08,395
你全身散发着蜜月期的臭味
You have the stink of honeymoon phase all over you.

685
00:23:08,395 --> 00:23:10,227
没有哪个女人想接近的
No woman wants to be around that.

686
00:23:10,285 --> 00:23:11,618
会持续多久呢
How long does it last?

687
00:23:11,944 --> 00:23:13,680
这说不准
Well, it's hard to say.

688
00:23:14,006 --> 00:23:15,368
但根据对你和珍妮的了解
But knowing you and Jenny,

689
00:23:15,368 --> 00:23:16,729
也许是一辈子吧
probably forever.

690
00:23:27,116 --> 00:23:28,698
芭比这人呐
Oh, yeah, Barbie.

691
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:31,710
她成天梦想成为百老汇的舞蹈演员
All she wanted was to be a dancer on Broadway.

692
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,513
她以前经常把这挂在嘴边吗
She used to talk about it a lot, huh?

693
00:23:33,513 --> 00:23:34,548
可不止呢
More than that.

694
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:37,109
她去美容了  换了发型
She got a makeover, changed her hair,

695
00:23:37,109 --> 00:23:39,276
两年前又给鼻子做了整形
and then two years ago, she got her nose done

696
00:23:39,276 --> 00:23:41,338
其实她鼻子原本就很好
even though her nose looked fine before.

697
00:23:42,528 --> 00:23:44,254
当时芭芭拉有没有和任何人有过纠纷
Back in the day, did Barbra have trouble with anybody,

698
00:23:44,254 --> 00:23:46,306
比如顾客或者男友
say a customer, maybe a boyfriend?

699
00:23:46,306 --> 00:23:49,250
男友  是有的  杰森
Boyfriend, yeah. Jason.

700
00:23:49,903 --> 00:23:51,034
是他吗
Could this be him?

701
00:23:51,034 --> 00:23:52,223
就是他
That's him.

702
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:53,835
杰森·巴格维尔
Jason Bagwell.

703
00:23:53,835 --> 00:23:55,312
你知道我们如何能找到杰森吗
Do you know where we can find Jason?

704
00:23:55,312 --> 00:23:57,786
他住在字母城[纽约曼哈顿一街区]
He lived over in Alphabet City.

705
00:23:57,815 --> 00:23:59,838
他总是耍阴谋诡计
He was always running some scam,

706
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:02,735
从芭芭拉那儿借钱用于新的投资
borrowing money from Barbra for some new business venture

707
00:24:02,735 --> 00:24:04,279
而且从不还钱
and never paying her back.

708
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:06,014
但是她爱他
But she loved him.

709
00:24:06,014 --> 00:24:07,367
疯狂的爱  懂吗
Crazy love, you know?

710
00:24:07,367 --> 00:24:09,160
我懂的
Oh, yeah. I do.

711
00:24:09,688 --> 00:24:11,606
你帮了不少忙  香檀
Well, you've been very helpful, Shantell.

712
00:24:11,606 --> 00:24:12,939
多谢你能抽出时间
Thank you for your time.

713
00:24:12,939 --> 00:24:14,713
如果你愿意  可以等会儿再来
If you wanted, you could come back later.

714
00:24:14,713 --> 00:24:16,199
我的表演八点开始
My show starts at 8:00.

715
00:24:16,199 --> 00:24:16,784
我可能会...
I could probably--

716
00:24:16,784 --> 00:24:18,760
他老婆喊他回家吃饭呢  香檀
He's gotta get home to the little woman, Shantell,

717
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,232
但我们真心感谢你的时间和合作
but we do thank you for your time and your cooperation.

718
00:24:22,232 --> 00:24:23,181
好的
All right.

719
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:27,929
你发什么神经  老兄
What's wrong with you, man?

720
00:24:27,929 --> 00:24:29,233
你为什么要坏了我的好事
Why you gotta throw salt in my game like that?

721
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:30,221
你现在不能勾搭女人
You can't pick up on honeys

722
00:24:30,221 --> 00:24:31,381
你会玷污手上戴的婚戒
while wearing the eternal symbol

723
00:24:31,381 --> 00:24:33,079
它可是象征着我对珍妮永恒的爱与承诺
of my love and commitment to Jenny.

724
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,013
-我是不是大声说出来了  -是的
- Did I just say that out loud? - Mm-hmm.

725
00:24:36,013 --> 00:24:37,845
怪不得女人们不和我调情
No wonder women won't flirt with me.

726
00:24:37,845 --> 00:24:38,996
因为她们清楚自己不可能勾引到
I'm a lost cause,

727
00:24:38,996 --> 00:24:40,904
一个深爱着自己妻子的男人
a man in love with his wife.

728
00:24:41,576 --> 00:24:42,669
知足吧  老兄
Enjoy it, my friend.

729
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:44,923
很多男人都羡慕你呢
A lot of men would switch places with you.

730
00:24:45,613 --> 00:24:48,059
当然我除外  别的男人
Not me. Mnh-mnh. Other men.

731
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:49,795
那些寂寞单身男
Guys. Unhappy single guys.

732
00:24:49,795 --> 00:24:51,089
是啊  把婚戒还我
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just give me my ring back,

733
00:24:51,099 --> 00:24:52,509
然后你可以去问香檀的手机号
and you can go get Shantell's phone number.

734
00:24:52,509 --> 00:24:53,669
下一个轮到你了
...You're next up.

735
00:24:56,431 --> 00:24:58,973
搞毛
What the... ow.

736
00:24:58,982 --> 00:24:59,817
怎么了
What?

737
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:02,233
卡住了
It's stuck.

738
00:25:04,142 --> 00:25:06,511
伙计们正在找芭芭拉的前男友
The guys are out picking up Barbra's ex-boyfriend.

739
00:25:06,511 --> 00:25:08,103
我正好利用这段时间来跟进
I thought I'd use the time to follow up

740
00:25:08,103 --> 00:25:09,589
他们在夜总会得到的情报
on what they learned at the club.

741
00:25:09,589 --> 00:25:12,179
首先芭芭拉·兰戴尔
Starting with the fact that Barbra Landau

742
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:13,867
确实做了整容手术
did get plastic surgery.

743
00:25:13,867 --> 00:25:15,631
这是她在车管局登记的旧照片
Here is her old D.M.V. Photo.

744
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:17,137
-她很漂亮  -是的
- She's a pretty girl. - Exactly.

745
00:25:17,137 --> 00:25:19,141
整容没有让她变得更漂亮
Plastic surgery didn't make her look more beautiful.

746
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:22,479
只是让她变得更像奥黛特·莫顿
It just made her look more like Odette Morton.

747
00:25:22,872 --> 00:25:24,915
还记得她的会计塞缪尔·林奇伯格告诉你的话吗
You remember her accountant Samuel Lynchberg told you

748
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:27,073
奥黛特为她朋友的鼻部整形买单
that Odette paid for her friend's nose job?

749
00:25:27,073 --> 00:25:28,645
你难道认为芭芭拉就是那个朋友
And you think Barbra is that friend?

750
00:25:28,645 --> 00:25:29,854
你认为她们互相认识
You think they knew each other?

751
00:25:29,854 --> 00:25:30,458
我确定
I know it.

752
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:31,695
林奇伯格的助手证实了这点
Lynchberg's assistant confirmed it.

753
00:25:31,695 --> 00:25:34,352
奥黛特为芭芭拉的整容和开销买单
Odette paid for Barbra's surgery plus expenses.

754
00:25:34,352 --> 00:25:36,749
我猜你一定对其中的原因有套理论
And I'm guessing you have a theory as to why.

755
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,888
你是清楚奥黛特喜欢派对的
You know Odette loved to party.

756
00:25:38,888 --> 00:25:40,125
从我个人经历来看
Speaking from personal experience,

757
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:42,676
那种持续的狂欢作乐
I can tell you that all that constant carousing

758
00:25:42,676 --> 00:25:44,776
是不会没有恶果的
does not come without consequences,

759
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:47,538
比如拘捕  罚义务社区服务之类的
Like arrests, community service hours,

760
00:25:47,538 --> 00:25:49,006
或在某个陌生旅馆房间醒来
waking up in a strange hotel room

761
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:51,499
头上还套着女孩的内裤  那...
with some girl's panties on your head. That's...

762
00:25:52,075 --> 00:25:53,398
当我没说过
Forget that part.

763
00:25:53,398 --> 00:25:56,390
这就是奥黛特在社区服务时拍的照片
Here is Odette doing her community service hours

764
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,635
是惩罚她在2010年第二次酒后驾车
for her second D.U.I. in 2010.

765
00:25:58,644 --> 00:26:01,368
这是奥黛特和朋友参加一个新娘婚前派对的照片
Here's Odette at a bridal shower with friends.

766
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:02,873
那又如何
So?

767
00:26:02,873 --> 00:26:04,082
根据时间标识
So according to the time stamps,

768
00:26:04,082 --> 00:26:05,492
这两张照片是同一天拍下的
these photos were taken on the same day

769
00:26:05,492 --> 00:26:07,410
相隔20分钟不到
within 20 minutes of each other.

770
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,846
就是说在救济厨房的其实是芭芭拉
So it was really Barbra at the soup kitchen.

771
00:26:09,846 --> 00:26:11,160
奥黛特犯了罪
Odette would do the crime,

772
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,116
却不想去做社区义务劳动
but she didn't want to do the time.

773
00:26:13,116 --> 00:26:16,214
所以她让假冒的自己去帮她做苦活
So she created a faux-dette to do her dirty work for her.

774
00:26:16,214 --> 00:26:18,535
估计给了不少报酬
A job that I bet paid very well.

775
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,050
也许在城镇的某个疯狂的夜晚
Maybe a wild night on the town

776
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,613
奥黛特来到了脱衣舞夜总会
Brings Odette to the strip club,

777
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:23,359
在那儿她见到了芭芭拉
where she sees Barbra--

778
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:24,586
见到了芭芭拉的"一切"
all of Barbra--

779
00:26:24,586 --> 00:26:25,727
而她意识到
and she realizes,

780
00:26:25,727 --> 00:26:26,821
只要花点心思
with a little work,

781
00:26:26,821 --> 00:26:29,381
芭芭拉能成为她完美的分身
Barbra could be the perfect double for her,

782
00:26:29,391 --> 00:26:30,849
去做那些
doing all the unpleasant jobs

783
00:26:30,849 --> 00:26:33,016
奥黛特懒的去做的差事
that Odette simply couldn't be bothered to do--

784
00:26:33,016 --> 00:26:34,896
社区服务  药检
community service hours, drug tests--

785
00:26:34,896 --> 00:26:36,852
再稍加训练和一点整容手术
And with a little training and some surgical tweaks,

786
00:26:36,852 --> 00:26:38,166
芭芭拉还能做更多
Barbra could do even more,

787
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:39,960
比如和奥黛特的经理人开会
like meetings with Odette's business manager

788
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,108
或是玛格丽特姨妈的无聊午宴
or boring luncheons with her aunt Margaret.

789
00:26:42,108 --> 00:26:44,390
奥黛特的小圈子里没有人知道这诡计
Nobody in Odette's inner circle could've known about the ruse,

790
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,627
所以当火车失事时
so that when the train crashed,

791
00:26:45,627 --> 00:26:48,581
芭芭拉看到了从配角成为主角的机会
Barbra saw her chance to go from understudy to leading lady,

792
00:26:48,581 --> 00:26:50,164
-她抓住了这机会  -这能解释她的转变
- and she took it. - Okay, so that explains the transition,

793
00:26:50,164 --> 00:26:51,689
但我们还是不知道谁杀了她
but we still don't know who killed her.

794
00:26:51,689 --> 00:26:52,974
也许我们知道
Maybe we do.

795
00:26:52,974 --> 00:26:54,882
肯定是某个看到电视后
It would have to be someone that knew

796
00:26:54,882 --> 00:26:58,018
发现其实奥黛特就是芭芭拉的人
Odette was actually Barbra when he saw her on tv,

797
00:26:58,018 --> 00:26:59,150
某个想要从
someone who was looking

798
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,116
她的新生活中捞好处的人
to cash in on her new life...

799
00:27:01,126 --> 00:27:03,446
就像芭芭拉的男朋友杰森
Someone like Barbra's boyfriend Jason.

800
00:27:04,837 --> 00:27:07,724
我是说真的  这太疯狂了  我没有杀人
I'm telling you, this is crazy. I didn't kill anybody.

801
00:27:08,146 --> 00:27:10,169
我认为事情的经过是这样的
Here's what I think happened--

802
00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:12,241
你意识到芭芭拉没有
you realized that Barbra didn't die

803
00:27:12,241 --> 00:27:13,718
在火车意外中死去
in that train accident.

804
00:27:13,718 --> 00:27:14,782
她还活着
She was alive.

805
00:27:14,782 --> 00:27:17,007
而且变成了奥黛特·莫顿  这意味着她很富有
And living as Odette Morton, which meant she was very rich.

806
00:27:17,007 --> 00:27:19,357
你知道她的秘密  而你也想变富
You knew her secret, and you wanted to be rich, too.

807
00:27:19,357 --> 00:27:20,220
但是芭芭拉不是那种
But Barbra wasn't the kind of girl

808
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,544
好不容易攀上枝头
to claw her way into the good life

809
00:27:21,544 --> 00:27:23,740
然后被你这种人占便宜的女孩
and then be taken advantage of by the likes of you.

810
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,591
她拒绝了你  所以你开枪杀了她
She rejected you, and so you shot her.

811
00:27:25,591 --> 00:27:28,199
看到没  这就是我什么都没说的原因
See, this--this is why I didn't come forward.

812
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:29,590
我知道你们会怀疑我
I knew you'd suspect me.

813
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:32,457
我们怀疑有动机的人  杰森
We suspect people with motive, Jason.

814
00:27:32,899 --> 00:27:33,810
你们搞错了
You've got it wrong.

815
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,478
是芭芭拉来找的我
Barbra came to me.

816
00:27:35,478 --> 00:27:38,087
两个礼拜前  她出现在我门前
Two weeks ago, she showed up on my doorstep

817
00:27:38,087 --> 00:27:39,295
把整个故事告诉了我
and told me the whole story.

818
00:27:39,295 --> 00:27:40,974
芭芭拉拥有所有她想要的一切
Barbra had everything she could want--

819
00:27:40,983 --> 00:27:42,575
一个完美的生活
a perfect life.

820
00:27:42,585 --> 00:27:45,903
她为什么会冒险联系你呢
Why would she risk it all by getting in touch with you?

821
00:27:47,227 --> 00:27:49,231
因为她想我了
Because she missed me.

822
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:53,364
而且奥黛特的生活并不像芭芭拉
And Odette's life wasn't as perfect

823
00:27:53,364 --> 00:27:55,465
想的那么完美
as Barbra thought.

824
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,596
芭芭拉很孤独
Barbra was lonely,

825
00:27:56,596 --> 00:27:58,735
她想跟我重归于好
and she wanted to get back together.

826
00:27:58,735 --> 00:28:00,835
她告诉我她发现了一些关于奥黛特的事情
She told me she had found out some stuff about Odette,

827
00:28:00,835 --> 00:28:02,792
她过去的什么秘密
um, secrets from her past.

828
00:28:02,792 --> 00:28:04,365
-什么秘密  -我不知道
- What kind of secrets? - I don't know.

829
00:28:04,365 --> 00:28:06,033
但是她说  如果有人发现了
But she said, if anyone found out,

830
00:28:06,033 --> 00:28:07,788
一切都会被毁了
it would all be over for her.

831
00:28:08,997 --> 00:28:11,203
你觉得她是因为这个秘密被杀的吗
You think this secret got her killed?

832
00:28:11,203 --> 00:28:13,600
她说她可以利用这个秘密
She said she could use it to her advantage.

833
00:28:14,885 --> 00:28:16,266
她只是还需要一些信息
She just needed more information.

834
00:28:16,266 --> 00:28:18,108
能够作为筹码
Information was-- was leverage,

835
00:28:18,108 --> 00:28:19,594
那信息可以保护她
it would protect her,

836
00:28:19,594 --> 00:28:21,388
但是她必须要快点行动
but she had to move fast.

837
00:28:22,874 --> 00:28:24,984
但她还是不够快
And she didn't move fast enough.

838
00:28:24,984 --> 00:28:27,161
芭芭拉从小一直跳舞跳到大
Barbra had been dancing since she was a little kid,

839
00:28:27,161 --> 00:28:30,642
她的梦想就是成为百老汇的明星
and all she ever wanted was to be a star on Broadway.

840
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:34,411
她就要成功了
And she was so close.

841
00:28:34,411 --> 00:28:36,253
所以不是她自己的过去
So it wasn't something from her own past

842
00:28:36,253 --> 00:28:37,701
使得芭芭拉被杀的
that got Barbra killed.

843
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,945
而是奥黛特的
It was something from Odette's.

844
00:28:42,913 --> 00:28:44,793
在她被害一周前
Okay, so a week before her death,

845
00:28:44,793 --> 00:28:47,392
芭芭拉假扮的奥黛特  举止古怪
Barbra, as Odette, is acting odd,

846
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,658
她错过彩排
she's missing rehearsals--

847
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:49,770
她找到前男友
She seeks out her ex,

848
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,359
告诉他奥黛特的完美生活并不完美
tells him that Odette's perfect life isn't so perfect

849
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:53,817
而且奥黛特过去的某件事情
and that there's something in Odette's past

850
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:54,632
-是个麻烦  -是的
- that's a problem. - Right.

851
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:57,663
她需要信息  她去哪了呢
So she needs information. So where does she go?

852
00:28:58,171 --> 00:28:59,140
苏珊·斯坦纳
Suzanne Steiner.

853
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,828
还记得吗  被害那天芭芭拉和她一起喝咖啡
Remember, Barbra met her for coffee the day she died?

854
00:29:00,828 --> 00:29:02,909
她想和苏珊聊聊旧时光
She wanted to talk to Suzanne about old times.

855
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:05,527
我不知道我能帮什么忙
I'm not sure what help I can be.

856
00:29:05,796 --> 00:29:08,500
那天奥黛特看上去挺正常的
Odette seemed fine the day that I saw her.

857
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,229
是吗
Mm-hmm.

858
00:29:09,229 --> 00:29:11,607
我一直忘记她不是奥黛特
Oh, I keep forgetting that she wasn't Odette.

859
00:29:11,607 --> 00:29:13,621
她们实在是太像了
Oh, the resemblance was remarkable.

860
00:29:13,621 --> 00:29:15,482
你说她想要叙旧
You said that she wanted to reminisce.

861
00:29:15,482 --> 00:29:17,016
你们两个有多亲近
How close were the two of you?

862
00:29:17,016 --> 00:29:18,723
我父亲在她祖父家做了
Well, my dad was the butler in her grandfather's home

863
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:20,210
二十年的管家  所以
for 20 years, so...

864
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,812
我们两个可以说是一起长大的
we practically grew up together.

865
00:29:21,812 --> 00:29:23,183
那她想要谈些什么
And what did she want to talk about?

866
00:29:23,183 --> 00:29:24,698
她问起了她祖父
Well, she asked about her grandfather.

867
00:29:24,698 --> 00:29:26,693
奥黛特的祖父
Well, Odette's grandfather.

868
00:29:26,693 --> 00:29:29,311
她说起他们以前有多亲近
She talked about how close they had been.

869
00:29:30,174 --> 00:29:32,399
然后还问起他去世的那天
And then she asked about the day that he died.

870
00:29:32,668 --> 00:29:34,145
-他是在睡梦中过世的  是不是  -是的
- He died in his sleep, didn't he? - Yeah.

871
00:29:34,145 --> 00:29:35,881
是的  他那时已经98岁了
Yeah, he was 98.

872
00:29:36,389 --> 00:29:38,134
很奇怪她会问我
It was odd that she asked,

873
00:29:38,144 --> 00:29:40,225
因为那时候我不在那里
because I wasn't there,

874
00:29:40,225 --> 00:29:41,808
但她在的
But she was--

875
00:29:41,808 --> 00:29:44,042
奥黛特在  还有我父亲
Odette was-- along with my father,

876
00:29:44,042 --> 00:29:46,248
在我提醒了她之后
and when I reminded her of that,

877
00:29:46,248 --> 00:29:48,214
她问起了我父亲
she asked about my dad.

878
00:29:48,214 --> 00:29:51,139
她说她想和他  叙叙旧
She said she wanted to... catch up with him.

879
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:53,163
你知道他们两个联系过了吗
Do you know if the two of them ever spoke?

880
00:29:53,172 --> 00:29:54,237
我把他的号码给了她
Well, I gave her his number,

881
00:29:54,237 --> 00:29:57,066
但我不知道发生了什么
but I-I'm not sure what happened.

882
00:30:00,144 --> 00:30:02,609
不行  还是拿不下来
Mnh-mnh. It's not coming off.

883
00:30:02,619 --> 00:30:04,508
像是焊在我手上了一样
It's like it soldered itself onto my hand.

884
00:30:04,508 --> 00:30:05,755
说不定是被邪灵附体了
Maybe it's possessed, you know,

885
00:30:05,755 --> 00:30:07,903
就像是斯蒂芬·金小说里被诅咒的邪器
like some kind of cursed object from a Stephen King story.

886
00:30:07,903 --> 00:30:10,070
我该怎么跟我老婆说  我没戴结婚戒指
How can I tell my wife that I'm not wearing my wedding ring

887
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,787
是因为我把戒指借给埃斯波西托
because I lent it to Esposito as an experiment

888
00:30:11,787 --> 00:30:13,715
来看脱衣舞女会不会和我调情
to see if strippers would flirt with me?

889
00:30:14,923 --> 00:30:16,851
也许她会觉得挺好笑的
Maybe she'll see the humor in it.

890
00:30:17,685 --> 00:30:18,903
-绝对不可能  -你死定了
- Not a chance. - You're a dead man.

891
00:30:18,903 --> 00:30:20,399
好了  查尔斯·卡森
So Charles Carson,

892
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,113
奥黛特死去祖父的前管家
former butler to Odette's late grandfather.

893
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:25,549
没有犯罪记录  但是听好了
No record, but get this--

894
00:30:25,549 --> 00:30:27,429
他的名字有点耳熟  我就查了
his name rang a bell, so I looked up

895
00:30:27,429 --> 00:30:29,290
星期三节目录制的宾客名单
the guest list from Wednesday's taping,

896
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:30,757
他在上面
and he's on it.

897
00:30:30,757 --> 00:30:33,768
奥黛特在最后时刻加了一张卡森先生的票
Odette called in a last-minute ticket request for Mr Carson.

898
00:30:33,768 --> 00:30:34,775
这么说他在节目现场
So he was at the show.

899
00:30:34,775 --> 00:30:36,722
是的  保安说他是在2点15进场的
Yes, security has him going through at 2:15,

900
00:30:36,722 --> 00:30:39,187
但在那之后就没有人记得见过他了
but after that, no one remembers seeing him.

901
00:30:39,187 --> 00:30:42,131
苏珊说冒牌货
Okay, so Suzanne said that faux-dette

902
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,327
想谈论她祖父去世的那天
wanted to talk about the day her grandfather died.

903
00:30:44,327 --> 00:30:47,032
如果这就是芭芭拉发现的秘密呢
What if this was the secret that Barbra was on to?

904
00:30:47,032 --> 00:30:48,701
如果格兰姆·莫顿不是自然死亡
What if Graham Morton didn't die of natural causes

905
00:30:48,701 --> 00:30:50,264
而她认为这个查尔斯·卡森
and she felt somehow Charles Carson here

906
00:30:50,264 --> 00:30:51,530
与此事有关呢
had something to do with it?

907
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:54,436
我们得去看看格兰姆·莫顿的验尸报告
We need to see Graham Morton's autopsy report.

908
00:30:55,069 --> 00:30:56,804
根据我对验尸报告的研究
Based on my reading of the coroner's report,

909
00:30:56,804 --> 00:30:59,499
我能看出为什么格兰姆·莫顿会被判为自然死亡
I can see why Graham Morton's death was ruled natural causes.

910
00:30:59,499 --> 00:31:00,276
然而
However --

911
00:31:00,286 --> 00:31:01,859
转折来了
Ooh. There's a however.

912
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:04,218
非常大的转折  说吧
A very big however. Tell 'em.

913
00:31:04,218 --> 00:31:06,414
有些异常之处让我觉得可疑
There were some anomalies I found suspicious.

914
00:31:06,414 --> 00:31:08,150
莫顿先生的双眼都出现了淤点
Evidence of petechiae in both eyes,

915
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,346
他的鼻梁右侧还有近期造成的淤青
fresh bruising on the right side of Mr. Morton's nose,

916
00:31:10,346 --> 00:31:12,255
而这一切可能是  比如说
which could have happened if, say,

917
00:31:12,255 --> 00:31:15,122
有人用枕头捂住他的脸造成的
someone was holding a pillow over his face.

918
00:31:15,122 --> 00:31:17,299
总之言之  有充分的证据表明
All in all, I think there's ample evidence

919
00:31:17,299 --> 00:31:19,821
莫顿先生是被谋杀的
that Mr. Morton was murdered.

920
00:31:20,464 --> 00:31:21,308
充分的证据
Ample.

921
00:31:21,931 --> 00:31:23,005
是谋杀
Murdered.

922
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:24,780
我太为你骄傲了
I am just so proud.

923
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,158
-老爸  注意公私分明  -好吧
- Dad, work. Boundaries.  - Right.

924
00:31:27,158 --> 00:31:29,805
还有件事  我要求对方把档案发来时
One more thing. When I requested the file be sent over,

925
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:30,438
职员告诉我
the clerk told me

926
00:31:30,438 --> 00:31:33,027
我是本周第二个要求看这个的人
that I was the second person this week to ask for it.

927
00:31:33,027 --> 00:31:35,607
奥黛特·莫顿周二也去过那里
Odette Morton was there on Tuesday.

928
00:31:35,607 --> 00:31:38,772
这么说芭芭拉发现奥黛特的祖父是被谋杀的
So Barbra realized Odette's grandfather was murdered

929
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:40,000
她肯定也想到管家卡森
and must have thought Carson the butler

930
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,805
跟这件事脱不了干系
had something to do with it.

931
00:31:40,805 --> 00:31:41,630
而当卡森发现
And then when Carson figured out

932
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:42,723
芭芭拉知道得太多了
that Barbra knew too much,

933
00:31:42,723 --> 00:31:43,692
就把她给杀了
he killed her.

934
00:31:43,692 --> 00:31:45,073
咱们明天一早就得把他叫来问话
We're gonna bring him in first thing in the morning.

935
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:47,096
还要以双重谋杀罪逮捕他
And arrest him for a double murder.

936
00:31:52,707 --> 00:31:53,570
早上好
Good morning.

937
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:55,248
我可一点都不好
Speak for yourself.

938
00:31:55,517 --> 00:31:58,250
理查德  我这次真是搞砸了
Oh, Richard. I really messed up.

939
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,609
我就是为了逞一时只气
I just let my ego get the better of me,

940
00:32:00,609 --> 00:32:03,640
这下乌娜·马可尼绝不会赞扬我的学校了
now Oona Marconi is never gonna endorse my school.

941
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:06,881
她也行还会为泄恨写些负面报道
She'll probably write something negative just out of spite.

942
00:32:06,881 --> 00:32:08,924
你还是有机会扭转乾坤的
Well, there is a chance you can still turn this around.

943
00:32:08,924 --> 00:32:11,638
但问题是你愿意向一个
But are you willing to apologize to someone

944
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:12,770
如此过分的人道歉吗
who doesn't really deserve it?

945
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,132
亲爱的  我觉得这现在根本就不是
Darling, I don't think a simple apology

946
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:15,877
道个歉就能解决的问题了
is gonna get me out of this.

947
00:32:15,877 --> 00:32:18,869
那我就只好引用唐·维托·柯里昂的一句名言了
Then in the wise words of Don Vito Corleone...

948
00:32:15,877 --> 00:32:18,869
电影《教父》中的教父

949
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:21,142
你得给她提出一个
you need to make her an offer

950
00:32:21,142 --> 00:32:22,897
她无法拒绝的提议
she can't refuse.

951
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:25,449
如果我能
And if there's anything --

952
00:32:25,449 --> 00:32:27,136
如果我能帮上忙的话
if there's anything I can do to help,

953
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,035
-告诉我一声  -我会的
- you let me know.  - I will.

954
00:32:29,035 --> 00:32:30,292
我会的
I will.

955
00:32:33,926 --> 00:32:37,226
卡森先生  你为格兰姆·莫顿工作了二十五余年
Mr. Carson, you worked for Graham Morton for over 25 years.

956
00:32:37,226 --> 00:32:40,640
据我了解  你跟他的孙子和孙女关系很好
I understand that you were very close with his grandkids.

957
00:32:40,649 --> 00:32:43,210
我们关系的确很亲近
Well, as -- as close as one could be

958
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,495
但我们仍是
while still maintaining

959
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:46,423
雇主与雇员的关系
the employer-servant relationship.

960
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,427
所以当死者打电话邀请你
So when the victim called you and invited you

961
00:32:48,427 --> 00:32:50,930
去参加周三晚上的《热舞之夜》的录制
to the "Night of Dance" taping on Wednesday,

962
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:53,414
-你欣然同意了  -我乐意至极
- you said yes.  - I was delighted.

963
00:32:53,414 --> 00:32:55,409
她让我在录制结束后跟她聚聚
She asked me to meet her afterwards

964
00:32:55,409 --> 00:32:56,828
她说她有个问题要问我
and said that she had a question for me,

965
00:32:56,828 --> 00:32:58,842
但正如你们所知的  录制取消了
but of course, as you know, they canceled the show,

966
00:32:58,842 --> 00:33:01,623
而我直到第二天才知道究竟发生了什么
and I didn't find out until the next day what had happened.

967
00:33:03,628 --> 00:33:06,179
我完全不知道
I had no idea

968
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:08,346
那个女孩根本就不是奥黛特
that that girl wasn't Odette

969
00:33:08,346 --> 00:33:10,427
我也不知道她要找我谈些什么
and no idea why she wanted to talk to me.

970
00:33:10,427 --> 00:33:14,043
她想找你谈格兰姆·莫顿去世那天的事
She wanted to talk to you about the day that Graham Morton died.

971
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:16,757
她为什么会对这个感兴趣
Why would she care about that?

972
00:33:16,757 --> 00:33:17,793
她似乎找到了一些证据表明
It seems she had some evidence

973
00:33:17,793 --> 00:33:20,478
莫顿先生不是自然死亡的
that Mr. Morton didn't die of natural causes.

974
00:33:21,965 --> 00:33:24,353
你把我搞糊涂了  你是说他是被谋杀的吗
I don't understand. Are you saying that he was murdered?

975
00:33:24,362 --> 00:33:26,750
莫顿先生去世当天你也在他家  对吧
You were at the house that day, weren't you?

976
00:33:27,144 --> 00:33:29,042
上帝啊  你不会认为我
Oh, good lord. You don't think that I had --

977
00:33:29,042 --> 00:33:30,903
你是和他关系最近的人
You were the person closest to him.

978
00:33:30,903 --> 00:33:32,581
你有充足的机会
You had ample opportunity.

979
00:33:32,581 --> 00:33:33,607
我们看过遗嘱了
We've seen the will.

980
00:33:33,607 --> 00:33:35,410
他给你留下了很大一笔遗产
He left you a generous bequest.

981
00:33:36,504 --> 00:33:39,525
我是绝对不会伤害莫顿先生的
I would never have hurt Mr. Morton.

982
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:44,310
但是那个女人
But that woman --

983
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:46,507
那个假扮成奥黛特的女人
the woman who pretended to be Odette --

984
00:33:46,507 --> 00:33:47,964
她可能猜中了他的死因
she might be right about his death.

985
00:33:47,964 --> 00:33:49,863
其实  有可能
In fact, it's possible

986
00:33:49,863 --> 00:33:51,762
她真认为我对此知情
that she believed that I knew something.

987
00:33:51,762 --> 00:33:53,047
告诉我
Tell me,

988
00:33:53,488 --> 00:33:55,186
莫顿先生是怎么死的
how did Mr. Morton die?

989
00:33:55,675 --> 00:33:57,229
他是被人闷死的吗
Was he smothered?

990
00:33:58,648 --> 00:34:00,336
你为什么这么问
Why would you ask that?

991
00:34:00,346 --> 00:34:02,983
他去世的那个月  家里的气氛一直很紧张
The month he died, there was tension in the household.

992
00:34:02,983 --> 00:34:04,719
莫顿先生不喜欢
Odette was seeing someone

993
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:07,001
奥黛特当时的男朋友
of whom Mr. Morton did not approve.

994
00:34:07,001 --> 00:34:07,740
你知道是谁吗
Do you know who?

995
00:34:07,749 --> 00:34:09,648
不知道  但是他命令她跟那个人分手
No, but he ordered her to break it off,

996
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:11,988
当然了  那天奥黛特哭得稀里哗啦
and of course, that day Odette was crying,

997
00:34:11,988 --> 00:34:14,060
几乎整个早上都躲在房间里哭
she spent most of the morning in her room.

998
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:17,589
一点左右时  莫顿先生说他想睡一会儿
At about 1:00, Mr. Morton said that he wanted to take a nap,

999
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:19,929
于是我把床上的枕头都拿走了
so I cleared the bed of all the pillows.

1000
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:22,039
他喜欢平躺着睡
He preferred a-a flat surface.

1001
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:22,912
过了一会儿以后
Now a few moments later,

1002
00:34:22,912 --> 00:34:24,580
楼下厨房出了点乱子
there was a commotion down in the kitchen.

1003
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:27,832
奥黛特把三明治放在烤箱里烤太久了
Odette had put a sandwich in the toaster oven too long,

1004
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:29,798
结果发生了小火灾
and it had caused a small fire.

1005
00:34:29,798 --> 00:34:30,651
我们把火扑灭了
We put it out,

1006
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:33,806
然后我去楼上查看莫顿先生
and then I went back upstairs to check on Mr. Morton,

1007
00:34:33,806 --> 00:34:35,504
他已经死了
and he was dead.

1008
00:34:35,504 --> 00:34:38,419
那时我就注意到了
And that's when I noticed it.

1009
00:34:38,419 --> 00:34:39,570
注意到了什么
Noticed what?

1010
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:41,814
床上有个枕头
A pillow on the bed.

1011
00:34:41,814 --> 00:34:44,692
而我很确定我之前把所有的枕头都拿走了
And I was sure that I had taken them all off.

1012
00:34:44,998 --> 00:34:46,264
所以我跟奥黛特说了
So I told Odette about it,

1013
00:34:46,264 --> 00:34:49,237
但是她说肯定是我记错了
but she said my mind was playing tricks on me,

1014
00:34:49,237 --> 00:34:50,331
我就没再追究
so I let it go.

1015
00:34:50,331 --> 00:34:51,894
卡森先生  你在厨房的时候
Mr. Carson, when you were in the kitchen,

1016
00:34:51,894 --> 00:34:55,040
奥黛特是否曾离开过你的视线
was there ever a moment that Odette was out of your sight?

1017
00:34:55,586 --> 00:34:56,392
没有
No.

1018
00:34:57,907 --> 00:34:59,605
我知道她是无辜的
I-I knew she was innocent.

1019
00:34:59,605 --> 00:35:00,851
她不是无辜的
She wasn't innocent.

1020
00:35:00,851 --> 00:35:01,887
她是为了引开你
She was the distraction.

1021
00:35:01,887 --> 00:35:02,942
奥黛特把你引到厨房
Odette got you down to the kitchen

1022
00:35:02,942 --> 00:35:05,541
而她的同伙则借机谋杀了她的祖父
while her accomplice went and murdered her grandfather.

1023
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:07,670
而当芭芭拉·兰戴尔搞清了事实真相后
And then when Barbra Landau figured out the truth,

1024
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:10,087
那个同伙把她也杀掉了
the accomplice murdered her, too.

1025
00:35:16,503 --> 00:35:18,689
感谢你能来  林奇伯格先生
Thank you for coming in, Mr. Lynchberg.

1026
00:35:19,265 --> 00:35:20,560
林奇伯格先生
Mr. Lynchberg,

1027
00:35:20,905 --> 00:35:23,168
作为莫顿家族的财务顾问
being the Morton family financial advisor,

1028
00:35:23,168 --> 00:35:24,722
你肯定对他们一家人的
that must give you pretty good insight

1029
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:26,813
私生活了如指掌吧
into their -- their personal lives, right?

1030
00:35:26,813 --> 00:35:28,874
知道一个人都把钱花在什么地方
Well, looking at what people spend their money on,

1031
00:35:28,874 --> 00:35:30,860
的确会让你对这个人有所了解
you get to know folks pretty well.

1032
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,200
那你有多了解奥黛特呢
And how well did you know Odette?

1033
00:35:34,015 --> 00:35:36,058
就跟我对其他客户的了解一样
As well as any of my clients.

1034
00:35:36,058 --> 00:35:38,666
但毕竟我之前多次为她的生活方式说她
But given the lectures that I gave her about her lifestyle,

1035
00:35:38,666 --> 00:35:39,645
或许更了解她吧
maybe more so.

1036
00:35:39,654 --> 00:35:42,320
据我们所知  在奥黛特的祖父去世的那段时间
We understand, about the time her grandfather died,

1037
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,807
她正在跟某个人交往
Odette was dating someone,

1038
00:35:43,807 --> 00:35:46,013
但她祖父不同意他们在一起
someone her grandfather didn't approve of.

1039
00:35:46,013 --> 00:35:47,758
这并不奇怪
Mm. Well, that's not surprising.

1040
00:35:47,758 --> 00:35:49,455
他们经常意见相左
The two of them rarely saw eye to eye.

1041
00:35:49,455 --> 00:35:52,141
你记得奥黛特的男朋友是谁吗
This boyfriend -- do you remember who he was?

1042
00:35:52,726 --> 00:35:53,762
不记得  为什么问这个
No. Why?

1043
00:35:53,762 --> 00:35:55,248
因为我们认为他伙同
Well, because we think that he conspired

1044
00:35:55,258 --> 00:35:56,792
奥黛特杀死了她的祖父
with Odette to kill her grandfather

1045
00:35:56,792 --> 00:35:58,096
而他后来又杀死了芭芭拉
and then he killed Barbra

1046
00:35:58,096 --> 00:35:59,890
因为她马上就要搞清楚事情的真相了
when she was on the verge of figuring it all out.

1047
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:01,386
你确定你不记得了吗
You're sure you don't remember?

1048
00:36:01,386 --> 00:36:01,990
确定
Mnh-mnh.

1049
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,553
我们跟奥黛特的哥哥通过电话
Well, we just spoke with Odette's brother,

1050
00:36:03,553 --> 00:36:05,155
他记得
and he remembers.

1051
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:07,505
事实上  他记得她的男友是你
In fact, he remembers it being you.

1052
00:36:07,764 --> 00:36:09,864
他说你们两个想要结婚
He said that the two of you wanted to get married,

1053
00:36:09,864 --> 00:36:12,770
但是奥黛特的祖父威胁说要剥夺她的继承权
but Odette's grandfather threatened to cut her off.

1054
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:13,959
奥黛特这样的女孩
Now a girl like Odette,

1055
00:36:13,959 --> 00:36:16,337
靠着你那可怜的六位数工资
she could never be happy living off

1056
00:36:16,337 --> 00:36:19,042
她可不会快活
a meager 6-figure salary like yours.

1057
00:36:19,819 --> 00:36:21,487
她得继承遗产
She needed to inherit.

1058
00:36:21,487 --> 00:36:23,079
但那老头子一直不死
But that old man refused to die.

1059
00:36:23,089 --> 00:36:23,981
于是她就说服你
So she convinced you

1060
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:27,136
利用她在厨房搞出的乱子
to go upstairs and smother him to death with a pillow

1061
00:36:27,136 --> 00:36:29,112
上楼用枕头将他闷死
while she created a distraction in the kitchen.

1062
00:36:29,112 --> 00:36:30,301
问题解决了
Problem solved.

1063
00:36:30,301 --> 00:36:32,574
只不过她一拿到钱
Except once she had her money,

1064
00:36:32,574 --> 00:36:34,808
她离开了你  继续她派对动物的生活
she left you, went back to her partying lifestyle.

1065
00:36:34,808 --> 00:36:37,503
她利用了你  但是你却束手无策
She used you, but there wasn't anything you could do about it.

1066
00:36:37,503 --> 00:36:39,728
至少在否认谋杀的前提下没有法子
At least not without admitting to the murder.

1067
00:36:39,728 --> 00:36:40,707
你们无法证明
You can't prove that.

1068
00:36:40,707 --> 00:36:42,299
他的死被判定是自然死亡
His death wasn't even ruled a homicide.

1069
00:36:42,308 --> 00:36:44,504
是的  但芭芭拉·兰戴尔是被谋杀的
No, but Barbra Landau's was.

1070
00:36:46,931 --> 00:36:48,801
警员在你办公室后的垃圾桶里
Uniforms found this 9 millimeter

1071
00:36:48,801 --> 00:36:50,997
找到了这把9毫米口径手枪
in the dumpster behind your offices.

1072
00:36:50,997 --> 00:36:52,023
弹道检测相匹配
Ballistics match.

1073
00:36:52,023 --> 00:36:54,824
杀死芭芭拉·兰戴尔的就是这把枪
This is the same gun that was used to kill Barbra Landau.

1074
00:36:54,824 --> 00:36:56,061
而且上面
And it's got...

1075
00:36:56,416 --> 00:36:58,995
全是你的指纹
your fingerprints all over it.

1076
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:09,545
上个月  她的信用卡账单多得吓人
Last month, when her credit card bills were so high,

1077
00:37:09,545 --> 00:37:12,384
我以为她又开始吸毒了
I thought she was slipping back into her old ways.

1078
00:37:12,384 --> 00:37:13,592
我对她说
I said to her,

1079
00:37:13,592 --> 00:37:15,683
我们做了那些事  得到这笔钱
"We didn't risk everything to get this money

1080
00:37:15,683 --> 00:37:18,320
不是为了让你毁掉自己
so you could let it ruin your life."

1081
00:37:19,078 --> 00:37:20,660
她看着我
And she looked at me, and...

1082
00:37:21,571 --> 00:37:22,195
我看得出
I could tell,

1083
00:37:22,195 --> 00:37:24,343
她根本就不知道我在说什么
she had no idea what I was talking about.

1084
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:25,599
就在那时
In that moment,

1085
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,428
我知道她不是我的奥黛特
I knew that she wasn't my Odette.

1086
00:37:28,428 --> 00:37:29,934
也是在那时她知道了你的秘密
And that's how she got on to you.

1087
00:37:29,934 --> 00:37:32,476
这个芭芭拉跟我说如果我替她保密
So this Barbra told me that if I kept her secret,

1088
00:37:32,476 --> 00:37:33,636
她也会守口如瓶
she would keep mine.

1089
00:37:33,636 --> 00:37:34,998
她以为这样我们就扯平了
She thought we were even.

1090
00:37:34,998 --> 00:37:38,048
她以为她可以就这样变身为奥黛特
She thought that she could just take the place of Odette.

1091
00:37:39,515 --> 00:37:41,059
要我怎么做
I mean, wh-what-- what was I supposed to do,

1092
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:43,006
让这个脱衣舞女住在她家
just let some dirty stripper live in her house

1093
00:37:43,006 --> 00:37:45,758
穿她的衣服  勒索我吗
and wear her clothes and--and blackmail me?

1094
00:37:45,768 --> 00:37:47,389
她不配过奥黛特的生活
Odette deserved better.

1095
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,479
怎么了
What's going on?

1096
00:38:04,479 --> 00:38:05,083
我就是在想
I was just thinking

1097
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:07,931
我们靠着梦想维持自己的生活
how we rely on dreams to keep us going in life

1098
00:38:07,931 --> 00:38:08,660
而当梦想
and how sad it is

1099
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,310
毁掉我们的生活时  这有多可悲
when they become the things that tear us down.

1100
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:12,515
芭芭拉·兰戴尔的经历那是特例
Yeah, well, that might be the case for Barbra Landau,

1101
00:38:12,525 --> 00:38:15,335
但并不是每个梦想没实现的人都这样啊
but not for everyone with dreams that didn't come true.

1102
00:38:17,013 --> 00:38:18,903
拿蕾妮来说吧
I mean, take Lanie for instance.

1103
00:38:18,912 --> 00:38:21,665
她想成为一个舞者  结果成了医生
She wanted to be a dancer. She became a doctor.

1104
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,525
一点都不可悲啊
That's not so bad, is it?

1105
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:26,230
你呢
Hmm. What about you?

1106
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,083
我知道你是因为
I mean, I know you became a cop

1107
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:27,966
你母亲被谋杀才当警察的
because your mother was murdered,

1108
00:38:27,966 --> 00:38:30,670
但之前你肯定有别的梦想
but there had to be something before that.

1109
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:33,096
小时候的凯特·贝克特长大想做什么
What did little Kate Beckett want to be when she grew up?

1110
00:38:33,096 --> 00:38:34,880
在斯坦福大学时  我念法律预科
At Stanford, I was pre-law.

1111
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,582
那么说你的梦想是在最高法院打官司
So your dream was to argue a case before the supreme court.

1112
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:39,867
是的  我当时正在努力
Mm-hmm. Yep, I was on my way

1113
00:38:39,867 --> 00:38:42,629
成为第一位女性首席法官
to becoming the first female chief justice.

1114
00:38:44,941 --> 00:38:46,341
不赖
Not bad.

1115
00:38:51,251 --> 00:38:54,234
拿不下来  你知道吗
Ah, it won't-- yeah, you know what?

1116
00:38:54,234 --> 00:38:56,066
我跟脱衣舞女约会要迟到了
I'm late for my stripper date, man.

1117
00:38:56,075 --> 00:38:57,418
不行  不行
Whoa. No, no, no. No, no, no, no.

1118
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,892
我今晚不能不戴戒指回家啊
I cannot go home again without ring on my finger tonight.

1119
00:38:59,892 --> 00:39:01,359
我家沙发有个弹簧坏了  我的背...
Our couch has a loose spring. My back--

1120
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:02,472
你试肥皂了吗
Did you try soap?

1121
00:39:02,472 --> 00:39:03,642
-试了  -那是我们在先试的
- Yeah. - Yeah, that was, like, the first thing we did.

1122
00:39:03,652 --> 00:39:04,937
-烹饪油呢  -我没想过用烹饪油
- Cooking spray? - I didn't think about cooking spray.

1123
00:39:04,937 --> 00:39:05,905
上哪找烹饪油去
Where am I gonna find cooking spray?

1124
00:39:05,905 --> 00:39:06,692
用这个
Here.

1125
00:39:12,168 --> 00:39:13,808
像丝绸一样
It's like silk.

1126
00:39:14,527 --> 00:39:15,850
可能会起作用
That might work.

1127
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:19,984
我觉得能拿下来了
Oh, yeah. I think it's coming. Yeah?

1128
00:39:26,007 --> 00:39:27,599
至少从我手指上拿下来了
At least it's off my finger.

1129
00:39:30,581 --> 00:39:33,449
乌娜  你能来真是太感谢了
Oona, thank you so much for stopping by.

1130
00:39:33,449 --> 00:39:34,657
谢谢  玛莎
Thank you, Martha.

1131
00:39:34,657 --> 00:39:37,419
我一定会专栏上找些地方
And I'll be sure to find a few inches of column space

1132
00:39:37,419 --> 00:39:38,829
提及你的学校的
to mention your little school.

1133
00:39:38,829 --> 00:39:41,332
太好了  谢谢你  你能帮忙真是太好了
Oh, good. Thank you. I really appreciate that, dear.

1134
00:39:41,332 --> 00:39:42,234
理查德  很好
Oh, Richard, good.

1135
00:39:42,234 --> 00:39:43,864
你刚好来得及跟乌娜道别
You're just in time to say good-bye to Oona.

1136
00:39:43,864 --> 00:39:45,283
很高兴再次见到你
Oh. How nice to see you again.

1137

我也很高兴见到你
It's lovely to see you as well.

1138
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:49,810
我期待接到你的电话
And I, uh, look forward to hearing from you.

1139
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:50,549
我的电话
Hearing from--

1140
00:39:50,549 --> 00:39:53,032
我知道你很忙  亲爱的
Well, I know you're in a hurry, dear, and, uh,

1141
00:39:53,032 --> 00:39:54,788
我再打给你  我们一起吃午饭
I'll call you. We will have lunch.

1142
00:39:54,797 --> 00:39:56,418
好的  拜
Yes. Bye-bye.

1143
00:39:58,614 --> 00:40:00,724
很圆满
All's well that ends well.

1144
00:40:00,724 --> 00:40:02,556
妈  为什么乌娜·马可尼会期待
Mother, why would Oona Marconi be looking forward

1145
00:40:02,565 --> 00:40:03,496
我的电话
to hearing from me?

1146
00:40:03,496 --> 00:40:06,075
是你说的如果需要你的帮忙
Well, you did say, if there was any way that you could help--

1147
00:40:06,085 --> 00:40:07,082
你应该先跟我打招呼
That you should let me know.

1148
00:40:07,082 --> 00:40:10,180
你先斩后奏到底答应她什么了
Exactly what did you promise her without asking me first?

1149
00:40:11,465 --> 00:40:13,201
你会读读她的小说
That you would read her novel...

1150
00:40:13,201 --> 00:40:13,988
妈
Oh, mother.

1151
00:40:13,988 --> 00:40:16,443
评价一下  然后交给你的出版商
And critique it and give it to your publisher.

1152
00:40:16,443 --> 00:40:18,179
小说讲得是
It is the inspiring story

1153
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:20,634
一位年轻的女士从百货商店店员
of a young woman's journey from department store clerk

1154
00:40:20,634 --> 00:40:23,741
变成百老汇明星的感人故事
to world-renowned broadway star.

1155
00:40:23,741 --> 00:40:25,793
小妞文学啊  老妈这真不是我的...
Chick lit? Mother this is really not my--

1156
00:40:25,803 --> 00:40:26,858
亲爱的
Oh, and, darling,

1157
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:28,383
在你评价她的小说时  措辞友善一点
When you give her your thoughts, do be kind,

1158
00:40:28,383 --> 00:40:31,797
成为小说家是她的梦想
because it's always been her dream to be a novelist.

1159
00:40:34,952 --> 00:40:36,333
友善
