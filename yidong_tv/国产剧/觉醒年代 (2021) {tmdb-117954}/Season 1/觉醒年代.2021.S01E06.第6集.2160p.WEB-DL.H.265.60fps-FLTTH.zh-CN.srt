1
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,050
Gabriel Wyath, 26.

2
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,870
Engineering student...
diagnosed about five years ago.

3
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:22,560
Delusions began to grow increasingly vivid and violent,
eventually requiring hospitalization.

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,170
Gabe has successfully masked his issues for so long

5
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,110
that by the time that anyone was aware
of the extent of his problems,

6
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:33,300
his delusions had convinced him
to try and blow up a government building.

7
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,370
So what are we looking for
when we make a diagnosis of schizophrenia?

8
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:38,430
Steph?

9
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,740
Well, many patients develop a routine
to help them maintain the illusion of control.

10
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,750
Double Americano.
Extra shot. Skim milk.

11
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,950
Extra hot. Thanks.

12
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,190
Black coffee?

13
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:54,860
Despite this, they
outwardly exhibit disorganized or odd behavior.

14
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:56,500
I don't think that's what I ordered.

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,160
Which can lead to confusion
and agitation.

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,390
Where did you put the Alderman file?

17
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,940
Who the hell is Alderman?

18
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:11,430
See?

19
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,980
Right where I said it was.

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,150
They might suffer from coexisting sleep disorders,
including insomnia.

21
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,700
The majority of cases become unstable
without medication.

22
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,760
Good.

23
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,910
The issue lies in what happens
when a patient refuses treatment.

24
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:32,270
Many will endure confusion, anger
and risk harm to themselves and others,

25
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:36,630
all in an effort to cling to things
that only they see and understand.

26
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,450
That's what makes these patients so dangerous.

27
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:45,630
The delusions that drive them
also convince them to try to hide the depth of their problems.

28
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,740
Our challenge is to...

29
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,850
try to find a way
to help someone who doesn't want it.

30
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,700
The risk lies in...

31
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,490
the damage they can do if we fail.

32
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,060
So tell me how this works.

33
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:05,990
I'm awake with my wife, and I close me eyes,
I open them... I'm awake with my son.

34
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,730
And this has been happening since the accident?

35
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,750
So you began working on one case
here in reality,

36
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,630
and then suddenly
you begin working another case there, in your dream.

37
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,750
It all feels completely real to me.

38
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,290
You can't tell whether you're awake or asleep
at this very moment?

39
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,480
Well I can assure you, Detective Britten,
this is not a dream.

40
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,900
That's exactly what the other shrink said.

41

44
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,860
Dad, the school says they don't have the permission slip.

45
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,770
You told me you turned it in.

46
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,990
How am I not the account holder
if my name is on the bill?

47
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,140
N-No, don't put me...

48
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,520
I gave it to the teacher, the guy with the...
thing on his head... I'll call him.

49
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,130
You can't call.
They had to be cleared last week.

50
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,320
And I'm sorry, I'll take you to museum myself... how's that?

51
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,700
It's not about the museum. It's about the fact that
now I have to spend the day in study hall

52
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,080
because you didn't turn in a simple piece of paper.

53
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,060
I'm telling you, I'm pretty sure I gave...

54
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,070
the guy something, unless I gave him the phone bill.

55
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,380
Well, no, no, no.
I'm talking to my son. Don't, don't...

56
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,240
Listen, how could it take you three days

57
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,300
to switch the service back on
when you have my money today?

58
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,690
Hold on a second.

59
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,330
Yeah?

60
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,770
I'm on my way.

61
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,440
Hello?

62
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,400
Hello?

63
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,630
All right. You ready to go?
I told you yesterday, Cole's dad is taking me.

64
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,570
- I'll text you when I'm out. - No, you won't.

65
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,910
Your phone's not gonna be on for three days.

66
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,630
What?!
It's gonna be back on on Wednesday.

67
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,830
The phone company messed up. I'm sorry.

68
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,180
Vega.

69
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,470
Those prints come back?
You asking me, Detective?

70
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,100
Mike, glad you could make it.
Len's waiting on us; the prints came back.

71
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,980
Really?

72
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,110
They originally made it for the astronauts.

73
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,540
I'm telling you, I sleep like the dead in this thing.

74
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,790
I'm not spending half my pension on a mattress.

75
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,620
Half?

76
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,810
We're talking about an astronaut bed, man.

77
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,680
I'm pretty sure I spent my whole pension
and probably a little of yours.

78
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,380
What?

79
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,610
Well, first of all, there's coffee in it.
Look, Len...

80
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,950
I dropped the thing, okay?

81
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,790
- No. There's also a ring missing. - What?

82
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,440
Yeah, there's one...

83
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,560
two-fingered brass knuckle ring,
with the word "WILD" inscribed on the top.

84
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,110
Look. No, no, no, no.

85
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,200
See, I picked everything up and put it all back in here.
I made sure.

86
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,590
This is why I tell them
not to let you guys take it out of the property room.

87
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,930
Do me a favor... it's a ten-cent knockoff.
It's got nothing to do with the crime.

88
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,120
Could you do some...
Lenny magic, make it disappear?

89
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,930
Just don't do it again. Okay?

90
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,010
- I owe you a large beer, my friend. - Y-You owe me a ring.

91
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,550
Never should've got out of bed this morning.

92
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:22,090
You know, I had that same feeling,
but it's 'cause I was very comfortable.

93
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,610
That astronaut bed... ooh.

94
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,750
Come on...

95
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,290
I wasn't the one who was too tired last night.

96
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,120
Just eight minutes of your precious time.

97
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,420
Eight minutes? It takes me eight minutes to get these clothes on.

98
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,210
Six.
No. You're going the wrong direction.

99
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,440
How about 12 minutes and a police escort?

100
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,370
And that is my final offer.

101
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,130
How about lunch?

102
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,520
- Lunch? - Yeah.

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,710
Sure.
All right.

104
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,590
But tomorrow we stay in bed all day. Deal?

105
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,500
Deal.

106
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,320
There was totally a sign there, and you blew right through it.
There was no sign.

107
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,540
- Let's go back. - I'm eating.

108
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,540
Because you know it was a stop sign.
No.

109
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,950
When we get to the station, I'm gonna write you a ticket.

110
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,810
All units, Code 3.
Possible hostage situation.

111
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,830
Vista Psychiatric Hospital.
11347 Vista Heights.

112
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,260
Seven William 43 and 45,
responding Code 3.

113
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,030
Come on. It's okay. Come.

114
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,470
What's up?

115
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,870
Guy claims to have the whole place wired with explosives.

116
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,610
He's got himself barricaded in there
with about 15 other patients, doctors and nurses.

117
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,910
We've set up a perimeter and already started evacuation.
This is the head nurse in charge.

118
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,480
He is a patient.
His name's, uh, Gabriel Wyath.

119
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,840
He just started screaming he was gonna blow the whole place up,

120
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,720
and then he locked down the high-risk wing from the inside.

121
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,770
You see these explosives? They look real to you?

122
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,980
He's got a bunch of acetylene tanks
with wires sticking out of them.

123
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,160
- Detective, he's on the phone. - Who?

124
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,510
The patient.
He wants to talk to whoever's in charge.

125
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,340
You're the senior officer.

126
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,020
This is Detective Britten.

127
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,160
Who am I talking to?
It's Gabe. Okay. It's Gabe.

128
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,950
You have to stop the noises. Stop the sirens. Okay?

129
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,320
I can't hear my thoughts and I need to hear what I'm thinking or...

130
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,120
Okay, Gabe.

131
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,300
Hold on a second. I'll see what I can do.

132
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,890
Let's have all units respond Code 2.

133
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,480
Seven William 45,
have all units respond Code 2.

134
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,750
Hold on a second, Gabe.

135
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,550
All right. How's that?
Gabe, is that any better?

136
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,540
Yeah.

137
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,320
Thank you.

138
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,570
Thank you. N-Now,
which one are you?

139
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,790
Raise your hand.

140
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,060
That's me.

141
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,370
Right here.
You got me?

142
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,400
I see you.
You look okay.

143
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,590
Thanks.
All right, Gabe, listen.

144
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,040
Here's what I need you to do:

145
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,650
I need you to let all those people you're holding walk out of here.

146
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,930
No! No!
Don't, don't... Hold on.

147
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,430
I tell you what I need. Okay?
That's how this works. Okay?

148
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,420
- That's how it works! Okay? - All right.

149
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,650
All right, Gabe. I'm sorry.

150
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:20,500
So, what do you need?
I need you to bring me my sister.

151
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,590
Okay? I know they have her.

152
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,950
I know all about it. Okay?

153
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:29,880
I-I just need to see her...
talk to her. Okay?

154
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,160
I-I just need to...
to see her.

155
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,510
All right, Gabe.
Give me a little time and...

156
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,900
Gabe?

157
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,820
What did he say?
He wants to see his sister.

158
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,530
Christy.

159
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,790
- You know where I can find her? - You can't.

160
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,790
She was murdered about four years ago.

161
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,220
Great.

162
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,780
We estimate there are 25 hostages.

163
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,670
He's got them locked behind
these sally port doors, here.

164
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,780
Here we go.
Everyone, this is Dr. Lee.

165
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,160
He's worked with the patient extensively.

166
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,840
We're just trying to get a thumbnail of what we're dealing with here.

167
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,620
Well, what we're dealing with is a very intelligent
and very troubled individual.

168
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,870
Gabe...

169
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,660
was actually a rising star
in a government research lab

170
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,770
when his condition started to become apparent.

171
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,790
He lived with his sister, Christy,

172
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:28,080
until four years ago when she was murdered
in a dispute with an ex-boyfriend.

173
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:34,160
Gabe responded to her death by creating an elaborate
conspiracy theory in which his sister was not murdered,

174
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,860
but abducted by agents from the lab where he used to work.

175
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,030
Despite our best efforts, he's...
he's grown increasingly delusional.

176
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,370
Doctor, bottom line:

177
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,040
Is this a guy we're gonna be able to reason with?

178
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:51,490
As long as he's allowing his actions to be dictated
by things only he sees or hears,

179
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,130
it's unlikely.

180
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,920
Very well.

181
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,260
This is a high security building.
Apparently, Gabe has overtaken the command room.

182
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:03,250
So, he can use all the measures designed to keep the patients in
to keep us out.

183
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:07,340
Realistically,
we're looking at 12 to 14 hours to try a full breach.

184
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:11,530
Our only immediate option is to try sniping him
through the small western window.

185
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,490
But if we're gonna get a clean shot,
we're gonna have to maneuver him into position.

186
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,900
The negotiator's trying to work out a trade
to get one of our guys inside.

187
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,800
See if we can't...

188
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,620
- direct him. - He won't let anyone out,

189
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,460
but he's agreed to let someone in
that can help him find his sister.

190
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,490
- We can work with that. - There's one complication.

191
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,660
He's saying he will only take the officer
who helped him with the noise.

192
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,460
- Detective Britten. - Absolutely not.

193
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,270
How else are you gonna take the shot?

194
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,700
Once you're in,
ease him toward the west side of the drinking fountain.

195
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,420
That's where we've got the best shot.

196
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,420
Excuse me.

197
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,750
Honey.
Babe.

198
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,110
I know you're gonna think I'm crazy;
what if we try that Lebanese place again?

199
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,500
No, I can't.

200
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,340
I know, but they say
that the lamb's gotten so much better.

201
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,270
No, no, I mean, a situation came up at work.

202
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,610
I... I got to take a rain check.

203
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,310
how?

204
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:11,480
Okay, well, what about dinner?
Dinner would be great.

205
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,280
You know that I love you, right?

206
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,470
Yeah, I love you, too, babe.
I'll see you tonight, all right?

207
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,750
See ya.

208
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,410
...not have been evacuated,
which all over a dozen people that remain inside this building.

209
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:25,910
Apparently, one officer has been admitted in
and is attempting to reason with Wyath.

210
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,180
????no comment.

211
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,450
We don't know what his demands are.

212
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:34,210
No stranger though, this man, to this sort of violence,
Wyath was arrested in late 2008

213
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:38,940
when he entered a municipal building
with explosives strapped to his body.

214
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,430
Shortly after this, he was transferred
to the high-security wing of this facility...

215
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,270
This is Detective Michael Britten.

216
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:50,140
Please leave me a message,
and I'll call you back as soon as I can.

217
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:57,830
Vega.

218
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,110
Efram...

219
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:03,100
y-you're not at this hospital scene I'm watching on TV, right?

220
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,760
Okay, listen to me...
Where is he?

221
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,870
Where's-where's-where's Michael?

222
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,970
We had a situation, and he didn't want you to worry.

223
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,880
My God. My God!

224
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,480
Sh-Show me you're clean.

225
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,040
I got nothing on me, Gabe.
Just like you told me.

226
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,690
Okay?

227
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,760
So let's stay calm.
Just sit down.

228
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,550
What did they tell you?

229
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:33,630
They told me to come in here and help you find your sister
and bring her to see you.

230
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,830
Did they tell you that I'm making it up?

231
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:42,770
Because that's how they dismiss you.
How they try to get rid of you.

232
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,910
Yeah, they did.

233
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,170
I'm not imagining things.

234
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:04,660
My sister is real,
and she's alive,

235
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:08,460
and whatever they told you, she doesn't deserve this.

236
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,440
She's the only one that ever understood.

237
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:20,150
When they tried to
split us up, take me away

238
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,680
because they said that I was sick,

239
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,420
that I wanted to hurt people,
she wouldn't let them.

240
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:31,140
She fought them, and instead of letting them haul me off
to a place like this...

241
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,680
...she took me to one like this.

242
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,140
She looks nice.
She protected me.

243
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,700
I let them take her.

244
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,030
I should have protected her.

245
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,820
And I didn't.

246
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,760
But now I need, I need to get her.
I need to get her back.

247
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,080
And that, that's what makes me sick?

248
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:11,280
Don't you think I would be crazy if I wasn't trying to save her?

249
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,480
Yes.

250
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,600
Look.

251
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,080
Look at this.
No! No, no, no! No!

252
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,340
No!

253
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:27,700
Okay. They think that I can't see through this?
I mean, but it's practically obvious.

254
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,680
Gabe,
can I ask you something?

255
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,760
What is that in your hand?
I know you're there!

256
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,360
This?
Yeah.

257
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,480
This is a dead man's switch.

258
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,660
It's what triggers the bombs, Detective.

259
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,820
I let go...

260
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,070
boom.

261
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,830
It's how I'm gonna keep them honest.

262
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,350
As long as I don't let go,
everything's fine.

263
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,320
But if they try something...
No!

264
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,570
No!

265
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:08,710
Excuse me.

266
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,960
This is how we'll find her?

267
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,820
This map?

268
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,220
That's where Dr. Wilde has her.

269
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,540
Dr. Wilde?

270
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,510
Two-fingered brass knuckle ring
with the word "WILD" inscribed on the top.

271
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:27,950
He's holding her.

272
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:31,580
He's got her in this secret underground location.

273
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,870
They think that she's gonna talk about my research,

274
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,250
but I keep telling them that she doesn't know anything.

275
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,400
But they won't even admit that they have her.

276
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,950
How can you reason with someone when-when they say that
she's not even alive?

277
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:50,020
Right.
Will you shut up!

278
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,180
I'm trying to tell him where Christy is!

279
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:55,530
Shut up!
Please.

280
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,410
Shut up!

281
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,580
Shut up!

282
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,250
- I said, shut up! - No! No! No!

283
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,010
No!

284
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,470
Get away from the window!

285
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,950
Sierra One, I have visual on suspect.

286
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,710
You got a green light on the shot.

287
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,010
Shut up!

288
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,870
Let go! No, Gabe.
Calm down.

289
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:23,560
You tried to kill me!
No, no, I'm trying to help you!

290
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,800
The switch...
I can pull the wire from the transceiver,

291
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,150
and it's the same thing as letting go of the button!

292
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,730
- Don't-don't do any... - Do you want me to do that?!

293
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,540
- No, no, no. Okay, I'm not touching it. - Let go!

294
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,570
Get away!
Stand up!

295
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,350
All right, let's just calm down, okay?
Gabe?

296
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:39,350
Turn around!
Okay.

297
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,520
I need you to stay calm, Gabe.

298
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,290
If we're gonna try and help you...

299
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,690
Shut up!
I can't think!

300
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,480
I can't have you causing this kind of trouble.

301
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,630
All right, let's just slow everything down, okay, Gabe?

302
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,410
Gabe!
Let us out of here!

303
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,790
Gabe! Gabe!
No!

304
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:17,140
Come over here and talk to me!
Gabe, don't!

305
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,540
That'll kill him!
Gabe, don't do it!

306
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,260
No, Gabe!

307
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,700
It's me.

308
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,600
That missing ring turn up?
The one that said "WILD"?

309
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,260
Sorry.

310
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,690
Your dad didn't notice you carrying two bowls?

311
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,810
I don't think he would have noticed if I'd had two heads.

312
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,800
He's acting weird lately.
Why?

313
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,470
Why? I don't know.

314
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,910
You don't ask?

315
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,040
It's none of my business.

316
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,090
Sure it is.

317
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,400
He could be getting fired.

318
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,570
Or, I don't know, he has a tumor.
Or he could have an eating disorder.

319
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,900
He doesn't have an eating disorder.
No?

320
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,980
How would you know if you don't ask?

321
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,090
We just... don't talk about stuff like that.

322
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,550
Would you know if your parents had an eating disorder?

323
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,180
Totally.
We practically tell each other everything.

324
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,460
Yeah?...
Where do they think you slept last night?

325
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:59,970
In your bed.

326
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,570
You're serious.

327
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,860
Yeah.

328
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,360
They practice progressive parenting.

329
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,810
As long as I tell them the truth, they trust me.

330
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:17,400
They must want to kill me.
No.

331
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,370
They'd be more mad at you if they found out
you were giving me this.

332
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,110
A lot of processed sugar.

333
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:25,970
So you're allowed to sleep over at your boyfriend's,
but you can't have Cap'n Crunch?

334
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,030
Progressive parenting.

335
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:35,290
See if the cleaning crew found the ring, will you?
No need.

336
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,410
Guy pled guilty this morning.
Case closed.

337
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,660
Really? You sure?
Yeah. He took 18 months.

338
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:46,220
After that, well, I'm sure he'll be a model citizen.
There's something wrong there.

339
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,950
We got to find the ring.

340
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,790
Need to find it? Why?

341
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,710
I mean, you said yourself
it's not important to the case, okay?

342
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,350
We got enough real work here.

343
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:58,340
I don't need you out there hunting,
looking around for cheap jewelry.

344
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,420
Now, if you feel bad,
you can send the guy a carton of cigarettes.

345
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,610
Look, can you ask them to keep looking?

346
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,140
Okay, look, I'll ask 'em, all right?

347
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,230
Mike, you still there?

348
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,490
Yeah.
So when you coming in?

349
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:27,070
No, I, I got to stop and see someone first.

350
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,590
Tell me about psychiatric drugs, the kind you inject.

351
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,410
Something that might cause hallucinations.

352
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:40,030
An anesthetic like ketamine, for instance,
could have that effect. Why?

353
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,110
The last thing I remember before I woke up this morning,
I got shot up with something...

354
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:49,150
maybe ketamine.
I don't understand how...

355
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:54,290
There's this guy, a mental patient,
he's taken some people hostage in a hospital,

356
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:57,550
and I was sent in to diffuse the situation.

357
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:03,110
He attacked me and injected me with something, and-and...

358
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:07,690
You mean in your dreams.
I don't know what's going on now.

359
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,460
Are you experiencing hallucinations?

360
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,970
No.

361
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,600
This ring that you're missing,
you said that it wasn't important to the case,

362
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,410
and yet you feel compelled to find it. Why?

363
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:31,270
The guy's looking for a after a Dr. Wilde,

364
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:35,110
and the ring's got "WILD" inscribed on it.

365
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,040
I see.

366
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:44,210
And this psychiatric patient,
what exactly is the nature of his illness?

367
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,260
He's a schizophrenic.

368
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:50,000
Would you say that you're frightened of him?

369
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,610
He's got the building wired to explode,

370
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,820
and I'm inside it, so...

371
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,340
you know, so I'm a little bit frightened.

372
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:05,720
What if I told you that that sounded like a positive step?

373
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,660
I'd say that's not exactly how it feels.

374
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,880
Through this missing ring,
you have linked yourself with a schizophrenic,

375
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,580
a man who's unable to distinguish fantasy from reality.

376
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,460
But in this situation you've created,
your own well-being 

377
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:30,340
depends on neutralizing him,
on defeating him.

378
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,970
And on some level, that means that you've acknowledged

379
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:39,050
the danger presented when someone refuses to see things
for what they are.

380
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,820
You're saying I'm dreaming to tell myself to stop dreaming?

381
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:48,090
I'm saying, right now,
it's a missing ring,

382
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,760
it's a permission slip,
it's a phone bill.

383
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:55,490
But what you're really afraid of
is what all that might point to.

384
00:24:55,490 --> 00:25:01,420
You're having a nightmare about madness, Detective Britten,
because somewhere inside,

385
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:06,290
you fear that if you continue to deny the reality of your situation,

386
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,930
this is where all that could end.

387
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,850
What are you doing?

388
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,360
You see a ring around the house?

389
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,930
Like, a two-finger gold thing
with the word "WILD" written across the top?

390
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,170
No. Why?

391
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,080
It's evidence; I got to find it.

392
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,190
I'll let you know if I see anything.

393
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:22,550
Rex! Get down here!

394
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,190
Come here.

395
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,900
Did you take the ring?

396
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,490
I asked you a question.
Did you take the ring?

397
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:38,650
I, I...

398
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,780
I didn't think anyone would notice.

399
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,960
It's evidence in a murder trial, son.

400
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,250
You can go to jail. I could lose my job.
I figured it wasn't important.

401
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:53,570
And that's a good enough reason to steal?
I wanted to give it to my girlfriend.

402
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:55,990
Your what?

403
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:59,230
She likes that kind of stuff,
and I can totally get it back.

404
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,110
What girlfriend? You don't have a girlfriend.
Yeah, I do.

405
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:07,490
Since when?
I don't know. A few months.

406
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:08,660
No. You would have told me.

407
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,830
You told me about the last one. The-the, the blonde one.

408
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,220
I didn't. Mom did.

409
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,370
Right.

410
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:28,050
I know since she died,
you want us to suddenly be, like, all cool, whatever.

411
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,440
But you're, you're still my dad.
What does that mean?

412
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,150
I don't know. We just...

413
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,370
We just don't talk about stuff like that.

414
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:44,120
So you were gonna, what, send me a wedding invitation?

415
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,000
Look, your mother's not here.

416
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,980
We don't have...
your interpreter any more.

417
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,650
It's just you and me.

418
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,920
And if we want to make this work,
we're gonna have to put some effort in.

419
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,950
I'm-I'm doing my best.
You got to do it, too.

420
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,460
Okay?

421
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:10,320
So, tell me something about her.

422
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:13,400
She got a name?
Emma.

423
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,720
Emma.

424
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,990
She worth stealing for, this Emma?

425
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,450
I'm sorry.

426
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,760
I'm supposed to see her tonight.

427
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,890
If you want to get the ring back,
you could, you know...

428
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:33,270
meet her.

429
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,460
Is it wrong that I still think it's romantic?

430
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,160
Yeah... a little bit.

431
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:48,540
But he's gonna get you something
he has to actually pay for, right?

432
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,060
Yes.
You kids still wear those big clocks, right?

433
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:56,530
I like him!
Why haven't I met him before?

434
00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:00,160
Yeah, Rex, why not?
I don't know.

435
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,820
All right, that's enough torture for one night.

436
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,710
You're not staying?
No. I got what I came for.

437
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:11,070
It's nice to meet you, Emma.
It's nice to meet you.

438
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,760
Okay.

439
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,470
Sorry, that's the way we do it in my family.

440
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:22,170
It's just, Rex and I are still at the, the high-five stage,
but we're working on it.

441
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,070
Just wait till you get home?

442
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,500
Dr. Lee, what are you doing in here?

443
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:20,480
They convinced Gabe to let me in.
You got a pretty big dose of ketamine.

444
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,990
You'll probably feel
the residual effects until it wears off.

445
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,160
You'll stabilize in a couple of hours. Easy.

446
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,610
How is he? What's he doing?
Well, he's been...

447
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,380
What?
What's going on?! What are they doing?!

448
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,900
Yeah, they're coming in.

449
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,980
They cut the power off.

450
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,420
Means he can't control the doors or cameras.

451
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,920
Who turned off the lights,
Turn the lights on!

452
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,960
Turn them on!
Turn the lights on!

453
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,970
What does that mean?

454
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:56,800
It means SWAT's trying to find a way
to come in here...

455
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:01,110
and shoot a man who's wired to explode.

456
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,490
Why won't they just bring her to me?

457
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:22,610
Gabe, I need you to let me to make a phone call
or they're gonna come in here.

458
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:24,120
I won't let that happen.

459
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:30,760
I can still stop them.
Please?

460
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:36,800
Look, you want answers to your questions, don't you?

461
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:41,870
If they come in here and everybody dies,
then you don't get any questions answered.

462
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:45,360
So, please,
let me make a call.

463
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:59,230
Vega.
Tell SWAT to stand down.

464
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,160
Gabe has a dead man's switch.

465
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,640
- Tell SWAT. - Stop! Stop!

466
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,150
Let's break 'cause the guy's got a dead man's trigger.

467
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,910
We shoot him, the whole place goes up.

468
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:12,890
Stand down. Stand down.
Everyone hold your position.

469
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,180
For now.

470
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:18,230
Okay, they're holding. What do we do?

471
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:21,270
I-I need you to look into a couple of things.

472
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:24,710
Gabe says his sister's being held by a Dr. Wilde.

473
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,930
Is there anything on file?
Dr. Wilde?

474
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,670
I don't know. I'll check.

475
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:35,010
And see what you can dig up on a trip
he took with his sister just before she died.

476
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,450
Trip? To where?
To a beach or something.

477
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:42,100
Okay. Thank you.
All right, I'll see if I can find anything,

478
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:46,780
and I'll get back to you.
It's gonna take a little time.

479
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,830
You know,

480
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,250
sometimes I see her.

481
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:01,480
Here, in my room or...

482
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,590
she'll just be beside me walking down the hall.

483
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,050
I know she's not...

484
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,780
I-I know she's not really here,

485
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:12,830
but it just feels so good to be around her again.

486
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,340
They keep saying

487
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:23,360
that-that I... see things
that aren't there.

488
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:26,360
But that's not my problem.

489
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,180
You know what my problem is?

490
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:33,340
No matter how hard I try, eventually,

491
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:37,900
I stop seeing things that aren't there.

492
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,130
That's why I had to do this.

493
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:46,340
I don't want to imagine seeing Christy any more.

494
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,200
I want it to be real.

495
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,980
All right?

496
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,640
Yeah?

497
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,630
I've got no reference to Dr. Wilde anywhere.

498
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,720
Not in the lab where he worked,
not where he went to school,

499
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,880
no one he's ever seen for treatment, nothing.

500
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:13,920
The only reference to Wilde in the file at all
is the Wild Rose Cemetery where Gabe's sister is buried.

501
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,910
He's holding her.

502
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:22,370
He's got her in this... secret underground location.

503
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:25,810
I also don't have anything about a trip in '07.

504
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:31,130
All the records say that at that point,
he was in pretty heavy therapy and afraid to travel.

505
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:35,170
All right.
Keep looking.

506
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:43,080
They're getting somewhere.
Just need a little bit more time.

507
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:44,980
Okay?

508
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,610
Doesn't make sense.

509
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:04,920
What?

510
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:09,220
Vega says there's no way this guy
took a trip in '07.

511
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:13,280
Maybe that's not what it refers to.

512
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:18,950
Maybe.
Did he find out anything more about Dr. Wilde?

513
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,370
No, Wilde's not the name
of a doctor holding Christy underground,

514
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,810
it's the name of the cemetery where she's buried.

515
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,950
There's got to be something here.

516
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:35,830
Detective Britten, this is a huge step.

517
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,100
The fact that he's taken this detail
and put it into his narrative,

518
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:45,050
it demonstrates that, on some level,
he remembers burying Christy in that cemetery.

519
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,850
On some level, he knows that she's dead.

520
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:53,160
If guided properly, we can help him to understand
that there is no sister to bring to him.

521
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,800
We can end this standoff.

522
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,790
You want me to tell him his sister is dead?

523
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:04,130
Isn't that exactly what you've been doing for years?
It's different this time.

524
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:07,820
It's not you telling him, it's him telling you.

525
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:14,570
These glimpses of-of a healthy mind
buried under layers of delusion and denial are rare.

526
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:19,740
It's up to us to properly seize them,
to guide him.

527
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:22,650
I don't know.
I don't think...

528
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,760
What are you talking about?

529
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:36,480
All right, look, Gabe...

530
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:40,570
I wasn't completely honest with you before.

531
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:45,330
I do have information about Christy.

532
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,730
Do you know where she is?

533
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,110
Since your wife's funeral.

534
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:09,880
There's no world in which your son survived the accident.

535
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,340
She escaped.

536
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,140
Nobody was meant to know,

537
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:42,980
because this place they were holding her underground
was meant to be inescapable.

538
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:46,570
Honestly, they thought it was impossible.
But she did it.

539
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,530
Christy got out.

540
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:54,460
She beat them,
Gabe.

541
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:59,410
And-and she managed to leave a message for you.

542
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:03,410
And Dr. Wilde, of course,
was trying to keep the whole thing a secret.

543
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,040
What did she say?

544
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,590
She wanted you to know that she was okay,

545
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:14,820
that she was free and happy,
and she was never gonna let anyone catch her again.

546
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:22,180
And she promised that someday, someplace,
you will see her again.

547
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,520
The last line just read...

548
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:31,040
"I love you, Trip."

549
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,920
She's okay.

550
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,590
Yeah.

551
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:50,830
She's okay.

552
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:01,250
How did you know his sister called him Trip?
I didn't.

553
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:06,440
I saw it on the picture, and his name was Gabriel Wyath III, 

554
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,740
so I figured I'd give it a shot.

555
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,460
I don't understand.
Trip. As in triple.

556
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,790
Nickname for third.

557
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:17,160
So you had the opportunity to help this patient see the truth,

558
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:22,090
but you chose instead to perpetuate
his denial. Why?

559
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:26,020
How would he be better off,
thinking of his sister in the ground somewhere

560
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:31,480
than-than thinking of her free, liberated, waiting for him?

561
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:37,560
Explain to me what exactly
is so great about seeing reality for what it is?

562
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,840
You've more or less summed up the reason why

563
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:45,200
every major religion has some version of an afterlife.

564
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,630
the part you ????

565
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:53,240
You built a story about the costs of living with fantasies,

566
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,910
and you allowed it to point you back to
all the things that get lost

567
00:39:56,910 --> 00:40:01,830
in the shuffle between these worlds,
like this relationship of your son's.

568
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:07,380
But when you came
face-to-face with the larger revelations,

569
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,970
you backed down.

570
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:17,040
You retreated into a-a scenario where
you save the day, you play the hero,

571
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,560
win the affection of the wife you've feared losing,

572
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:26,390
and the approval of the therapist
who's expressed doubts in you.

573
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:31,880
Just like Gabe, you hold the keys
that will tell you what's real and what's not.

574
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:36,730
But for the moment, you're unwilling to turn them.(THAT'S NOT MY PENGUIN)

575
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,650
What's that?

576
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,620
My God, I remember this.

577
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:52,080
You and Mom used to read this to me, like, every night.

578
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,570
For years.

579
00:40:55,540 --> 00:41:00,310
Gabe didn't need to be forced into some kind of revelation
for his story to turn out okay,

580
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:03,790
so why are you so eager to do it to me?

581
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,060
Detective Britten, you are comparing yourself

582
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:12,040
to a schizophrenic whose delusions led him
to be institutionalized.

583
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:18,700
I'd strongly prefer if we find a way to help you
before you get that far.

584
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:26,280
Well, didn't you feel frightened?
Frightened?

585
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:30,090
Yeah, of course.
Who wouldn't? Didn't you?

586
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,460
Absolutely.

587
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,740
But then, I wasn't inside like you.

588
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,070
After I advised you on-on how to approach Gabe,

589
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:40,570
they put me in this secured van,
in case I could be useful.

590
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,000
Dr. Lee?

591
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,180
But as it turned out, you did fine without me.

592
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,780
Are you all right?

593
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,530
Yeah.

594
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:09,070
I'm sorry, I feel a little... strange.

595
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:12,830
It's probably the drugs wearing off.

596
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,300
I think you're finally making some real progress.

597
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,920
At this point, the best thing is probably for you to just...

598
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,320
get some sleep.

599
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:43,320
