11
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,680
There's only one reason a teenage girl

12
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,090
leaps out of bed this happy on a school day --

13
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,690
First love.

14
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:10,660
For my sister,

15
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,160
it was our neighbor across the street --

16
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,390
Drew Kremp.

17
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:16,740
And, man, oh, man,

18
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,000
things got real serious real fast.

19
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,380
Listen, I know we've only been dating for a few weeks,

20
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,650
but there's something I've got to ask you.

21
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,980
Erica Elizabeth Goldberg, will you --

22
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,460
My middle name's Dorothy, but that -- that's okay.

23
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,210
Uh, whatever you're gonna say, just say it.

24
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,550
Will you wear my varsity jacket?

25
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,720
Yes! Yes, I will!

26
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,690
The varsity jacket -- the high-school equivalent

27
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,110
- of a marriage proposal. - Oh, my god.

28
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,510
It's like a slipper -- Like a glass slipper, but it's not!

29
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,340
It's a jacket!

30
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,000
My moody, angry sister

31
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,580
had somehow been replaced by a giddy, love-struck teenager.

32
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,770
Mom, so good.

33
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,730
I don't say this enough, but I love tacos.

34
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,420
And I love my family.

35
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,780
We called it the time of great peace.

36
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,350
For some, it was confusing.

37
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,440
I think she's on drugs.

38
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,950
A-are you hopped up on goofballs?

39
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,040
You're the cutest!

40
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,160
We've all been there.

41
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,350
It's the happiest time in a young person's life.

42
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,570
Your head's in the clouds, and nothing will bring you down...

43
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,050
Oh. Sorry! Have a great day.

44
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,180
Except when your first love dumps your ass for no reason at all.

45
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,030
Boopie, what's wrong? What is it?

46
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,660
Come, sit. Tell mama.

47
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,780
What are you saying?

48
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,040
Are you physically hurt?

49
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,180
Did someone drop something on you?

50
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,660
And then -- and then -- and then...

51
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,270
I can't understand you.

52
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,730
She said Drew Kremp drove her home today

53
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,740
in his sweet mustang and dumped her out of nowhere.

54
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,140
How the hell did you understand her?

55
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,250
As most of you know,

56
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,730
I've, uh, spent a majority of my life hysterical

57
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,310
and emotionally out of control.

58
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,320
I speak the language.

59
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,910
She'd like some hot tea with a little bit of honey.

60
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,040
And with that, the time of great peace

61
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,650
descended into the age of darkness.

62
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,660
My strong, independent sister

63
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,930
turned into an irrational hot mess.

64
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,460
She moped in her room.

65
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,900
She sobbed in her car.

66
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,940
And she wept through dinner.

67
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,780
Sweetie, you have to eat.

68
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,390
Food reminds me of Drew.

69
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,080
He used to eat food.

70
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,720
Baby, if you don't eat,

71
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,640
then I have failed as a mother.

72
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,770
Then you have failed. We all have failed.

73
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,050
Just take them! Just take the tots!

74
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,870
Peanut, believe me, it's his loss.

75
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,840
I am dead inside,

76
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,690
And that's what you say to me?

77
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,410
She said she's dead inside --

78
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,070
I know what she said!

79
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,850
It was April 29, 1980-something,

80
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,160
and Barry and I were strolling

81
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,900
into the one place that gave us pure joy like no other.

82
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,230
That's right -- the arcade.

83
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,340
We're home.

84
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,660
Here you go, boys.

85
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,730
Have fun with your beep-bop-boop.

86
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,330
Back then, you couldn't just download a game to your phone.

87
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,120
You needed a roll of quarters and nerves of steel.

88
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,000
First we'd play the classics like "Pac-man" and "Centipede."

89
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,540
Then we'd blow most of our quarters on "Dragon's lair."

90
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,300
How'd they get a cartoon into a video game?

91
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,870
You're so dumb. They pour it in the top.

92
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,160
But our jam was "Zaxxon."

93
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,250
It was the greatest game ever made...

94
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,340
Until they made a better one.

95
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,530
It was called "Punch-out!!"

96
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,270
It combined everything my brother loved --

97
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,690
Video games, sports,

98
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,500
and graphic, senseless violence.

99
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,690
We're gonna get to know each other real good.

100
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,400
While we were lost in our world of video games,

101
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,430
my mom was gonna help Erica get clarity on the break-up.

102
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,400
She went across the street to Virginia Kremp,

103
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,580
her best friend and Drew's mother.

104
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,220
- Hi! - Hi.

105
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,710
- Hi. - Hi.

106
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,120
- Hi. - Hi.

107
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,450
How's Erica holding up?

108
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,380
Ugh, she's a mess.

109
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,470
How's Drew?

110
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,840
- He's great. - Hmm?

111
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,850
I mean, you know, he's good. He's -- he's fine.

112
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,140
He just went to the water park, which is...

113
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,610
Where he goes when he's sad.

114
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,360
That way no one can see his tears.

115
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,070
You know, it would really help Erica

116
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,290
if you could just tell me what happened.

117
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,490
Ooh, I'm not sure that's our business, Bev.

118
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,560
Isn't it, though?

119
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,730
I just think that Drew needs some time alone

120
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,260
to figure himself out.

121
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,870
Well, do you think he'll have himself figured out

122
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,410
in the next two days or so?

123
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,430
Probably not.

124
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,900
Oh, just one more quick question --

125
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,570
Uh, what is the name of Drew's new bimbo?

126
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,220
Beverly, there's no one.

127
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,610
So you're saying that Drew's made a terrible mistake,

128
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,870
and it's just gonna be a matter of time

129
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,760
before he comes crawling back?

130
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,130
Well, you better tell Drew

131
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,960
not to take too long to figure things out

132
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,320
'cause, uh, Erica's got a lot of guys coming around.

133
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,000
Lot of guys.

134
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,850
And one girl.

135
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,740
She's not gonna do anything about that,

136
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,150
but, uh... still flattering.

137
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,250
Think about it.

138
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,380
Barry had spent the past week trying to beat "Punch-out!!"

139
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,240
Just one problem --

140
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,530
He was out of quarters and had grown desperate.

141
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,210
A penny?

142
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,050
Worthless! It's the garbage of money!

143
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,130
Pops-aroni, looking good.

144
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,310
Did you lose some weight or just get a haircut?

145
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,540
Oh, what can I say?

146
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,110
I've been hit by the handsome stick.

147
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,900
Well, you look like a million bucks.

148
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,910
Speaking of a million bucks, can you float me a $20?

149
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,600
Is this for the arcade again?

150
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,590
This is the fourth time this week.

151
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,900
I got to cut you off, kiddo.

152
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,470
You can't cut me off. You're my grandfather!

153
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,340
You're supposed to give me

154
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,300
unconditional love and money until you pass!

155
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,890
I got three chicks on the string right now.

156
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,800
I got to manage my cash flow.

157
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,440
Be selfish. I'll find money somewhere else.

158
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,320
Hey, Ad-rock!

159
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,990
What do you say we go down to the arcade?

160
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,580
It'll only cost you $20.

161
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,310
Sorry, I got a spelling test tomorrow.

162
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,760
Why are you being such a ...

163
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,570
Easy! Easy! Easy!

164
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,220
Sorry.

165
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,760
Lost my cool.

166
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:27,760
I'm fine.

167
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,420
Okay. I got money.

168
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,050
I'll just cash in the $100 bond you gave me last year.

169
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,260
That doesn't mature for another 10 years.

170
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,840
It's hardly worth anything right now.

171
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,980
You're a filthy liar, old man!

172
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:38,990
Nope.

173
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,510
I did it again. Lost my cool.

174
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,450
I'm just...constantly thinking about that game.

175
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,080
You know what I'm saying?

176
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,430
It's cool.

177
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,760
It's cool. It's cool.

178
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,510
What are you guys watching?

179
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,890
I'm gonna go take a walk. I'm gonna go take a walk.

180
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,420
Hey, Dale.

181
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,480
Guess who cashed in his $100 bond

182
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:04,730
and is now sitting on 6 bucks of cold, hard change.

183
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,760
I don't care.

184
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,730
That's the stuff.

185
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,910
Figuring himself out? What does that even mean?

186
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,560
It means it's not you. It's him.

187
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,620
Please.

188
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,360
That's what people always say, and it's total bullcrap.

189
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,780
Please believe me.

190
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,440
You're tearing me apart. I can't see you this sad.

191
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,200
Just tell me you're better.

192
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,530
I'm not better.

193
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,280
My mood ring's been black for three days!

194
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,130
Then fake it...for me.

195
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,420
I wore my nightgown to school today.

196
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,580
I'm in agony. I can't take it anymore.

197
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,100
Way to make it about you, mom.

198
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,930
No, no, no. This is not about me.

199
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:56,250
It's about you feeling better so I can feel better.

200
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,690
Make me feel better.

201
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,570
Better?

202
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,940
All I know is that I can't feel any worse.

203
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,640
Are you kidding me?!

204
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,800
Shame on you, Virginia Kremp!

205
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,580
You told me there was nobody else!

206
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,760
Right to my face, you told me!

207
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,170
Oh, my god! Tracy Sullivan?!

208
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,760
Are you freaking kidding me?!

209
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,590
When I asked you if you thought she was pretty, you said, "Nah."

210
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,730
You said, "Nah"!

211
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,340
- He was just trying to spare her. - I didn't want you to find out this way.

212
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,310
So that's what you meant when you said he needed to figure himself out?!

213
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,840
I live across the street from you! You didn't think I'd figure it out?!

214
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,030
I was just trying to spare your feelings!

215
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,030
{\an8}He was just trying to spare her feelings!

216
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,570
Well, here's your stupid varsity jacket back!

217
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,420
Use it to cover up Tracy's stupid face!

218
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,510
Yeah!

219
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,260
Sorry, Tracy, I know this isn't about you.

220
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,450
Yeah!

221
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,030
I can't believe that this is happening.

222
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,010
Nope. Put those tissues down, missy.

223
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,250
I'm gonna fix this. You know how?

224
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,790
Mama's gonna find you someone better.

225
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,960
That's right.

226
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,530
There are plenty of other fish in the sea.

227
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,620
I'll go.

228
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,000
Erica had gone through 

229
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,030
six pans of brownies since the break-up.

230
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,770
Fortunately, my dad stepped in to help with words of wisdom.

231
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,870
Hey, peanut.

232
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,930
Uh, I'm gonna shut this off.

233
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,120
Look, every time I try and cheer you up,

234
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,950
I end up saying the wrong thing.

235
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,940
So this time I'm not gonna say anything.

236
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,680
I'm gonna let an old friend do the talking for me.

237
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,470
Sting.

238
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,400
"If you love somebody, set them free."

239
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,260
Wise words, don't you think?

240
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,780
You know what I think?

241
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:34,390
What are you doing? Why would you do that?! Who does that?!

242
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,120
Murray, what are you doing? Why are you in here?

243
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,250
I had good intentions! I went to my guy at Sam Goody.

244
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,440
His name is Randy,

245
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,420
and he's getting over someone, too.

246
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,180
She's a wild animal.

247
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,100
Don't help! Get!

248
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,580
He's right.

249
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,900
Look at me. I'm an animal.

250
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,970
I'm an animal.

251
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,970
Stop that.

252
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,620
- But -- - Stop it!

253
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,380
Lainey's birthday is tonight, and, damn it, you're going.

254
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,680
- No way. - Lainey's your best friend.

255
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,790
Well, Lainey's also friends with Tracy,

256
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,520
which means that Drew will be there.

257
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,410
Even better. And you want to know why?

258
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,630
They are gonna freak

259
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,410
when you walk into that restaurant with a college guy.

260
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,400
What college guy?

261
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,330
I was at dr. Kaczander's office earlier,

262
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,470
and it seems his son, Bruce, is single and ready to mingle.

263
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,410
I am not going out

264
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,350
with your podiatrist's son named Bruce.

265
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,360
He goes to Penn, he's a classics major,

266
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:24,150
and he drives a way cooler car than Drew.

267
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,970
Cooler than a mustang 5.0?

268
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,630
Yes. A saab.

269
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,410
A saab? What the hell is that?

270
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,900
It's Swedish. It's sporty.

271
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,550
It's got a key in the middle, next to the armrest.

272
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,740
It's like a spaceship.

273
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,700
Drew is gonna see you with that college hunk,

274
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,350
go crazy with jealousy,

275
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,310
and regret treating you this way.

276
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,200
And with that,

277
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,790
Beverly Goldberg's matchmaking skills saved the day.

278
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,390
Amazingly, Bruce, the podiatrist's son,

279
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,800
was an uncanny mix

280
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:50,440
of Patrick Swayze and Patrick Dempsey.

281
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,130
Not even Drew Kremp could deny it.

282
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,520
Hi. This is Bruce.

283
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,300
He's in college. Look at him.

284
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,050
You... can sit next to me.

285
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,850
Scoot. Scoot. Down.

286
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,420
You must be Lainey.

287
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,480
Yes.

288
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,710
I brought you a little something for your birthday.

289
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,360
It's my favorite sake.

290
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:09,250
He has a favorite sake, yeah, and he drives a saab.

291
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,680
As Erica's surprise for Drew was paying off,

292
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:14,190
Pops and I had a surprise of our own for Barry.

293
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,150
Hey.

294
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,080
Barry, please have a seat.

295
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,350
What's going on?

296
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,340
Well, w-we're all here because we love you

297
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,840
and we care about you

298
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,730
and we want to see you get better.

299
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,980
It's an intervention.

300
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,690
We invited all your friends over to tell you how we feel.

301
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,700
But only Roger's here.

302
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,340
I was the 10th person they called.

303
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,720
Shut up, Roger.

304
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,320
Listen, you've been spending way too much time at the arcade.

305
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,510
You're on edge.

306
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,480
You've been neglecting your schoolwork.

307
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:44,560
You stopped showering.

308
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,750
Who showers every day?!

309
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,890
What am I, the governor?! This is ridiculous!

310
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,520
I don't have the problem. You have the problem.

311
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,390
What problem do we have?

312
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,160
You're addicted to being jerks!

313
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,650
I can quit the arcade any time I want.

314
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,440
Barry, you're scrounging around for quarters right now.

315
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,770
No, I'm not.

316
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,200
I was looking for this fork.

317
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,470
'cause I'm gonna eat coleslaw.

318
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,580
Does that mean I'm addicted to coleslaw, too?

319
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,240
I don't know. I don't care anymore.

320
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,240
This whole thing's gotten very weird.

321
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,150
Barry, please. You cashed in your bonds.

322
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,500
You emptied your piggy bank. You sold your baseball cards.

323
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,510
This arcade's eating you alive.

324
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,000
We care about you, dude.

325
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,410
We want you around for a long time.

326
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,900
Roger! Go!

327
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,370
Maybe you're right.

328
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,850
Maybe I do have a problem.

329
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,390
There you go.

330
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,350
Just know we're always here for you.

331
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,940
We love you, kiddo.

332
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,950
- I won't let you down. - But he did.

333
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,540
And the first place Barry went --

334
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,370
My room, in search of pocket change.

335
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,720
Something. Just something.

336
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,800
But what he found was way more valuable.

337
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,840
How much will you give me for this?

338
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,200
- Three bucks. - What?

339
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,240
I stole it from my brother. He said it's priceless.

340
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,560
Oh, it's hot. Sorry, I'm not interested.

341
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,840
Dude, what kind of weird, honest pawn shop is this?

342
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,240
The grown-up kind that sells things that grown-ups want --

343
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,010
Like engagement rings and guns.

344
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,500
Come on. 10 bucks.

345
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,470
Some nerd will pay top dollar for this.

346
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,300
Really? No landing gear.

347
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,430
The gun turret's cracked. And no radar disc.

348
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,700
How would this thing ever do the kessel run in 12 parsecs?

350
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,300
I don't know what any of that means, okay?

351
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,260
Just give me a few quarters, and I'll go away.

352
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,400
As Barry pawned away the last shred of his dignity,

353
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,350
Erica's date was really starting to sizzle.

354
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,190
Would anyone like a refill on their soda?

355
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,840
It's actually my 21st birthday.

356
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,580
So how about mai tais all around?

357
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:32,270
Well, the balloon says you're 17, so how about no?

358
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,770
Well, I'm not 17.

359
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,090
Eight mai tais, please. All for me.

360
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,110
It's been a tough week.

361
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,560
Yeah, college is really hard 'cause he's in college.

362
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,170
Now, who wants sake?

363
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,130
No, thanks. I don't drink.

364
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,820
Who brought the wet blanket?

365
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:50,360
No, I don't drink when there's a table of cops next to us.

366
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,000
There's what now?

367
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,900
I don't even know this girl, all right?

368
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,840
My dad is her mom's podiatrist!

369
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,430
The only reason I agreed to go out with her

370
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,600
is 'cause he said I could use his saab!

371
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:02,400
Well, that's a real sob story, am I right?

372
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,890
You're such an ass, Drew.

373
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,590
I love you.

374
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,210
- What? - Nothing.

375
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,230
Meanwhile, at the arcade,

376
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,240
Barry was jonesing to beat "Punch-out!!"

377
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,420
Unfortunately, it was beating him.

378
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:21,090
Focus, Barry! Focus!

379
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,030
Beat it, Lyle. You're bad luck.

380
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,410
This was it -- the last quarter.

381
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,510
One final shot at glory.

382
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,670
What happened next was legendary.

383
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,820
Yes! Yes!

384
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,650
That single quarter lasted Barry 20 minutes.

385
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,610
Go! Let's go!

386
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,640
He was a man possessed,

387
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:44,110
knocking out glass Joe, bald Bull, pizza Pasta.

388
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,760
- There was no one who could take my brother down. - Yes! Yes! Yes!

389
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,830
No one except...

390
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:50,970
No!

391
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,230
...me.

392
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,530
What did you do?!

393
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,310
What did you do?! My millennium falcon'gone.

394
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,890
Did you really think I wouldn't notice?!

395
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,790
Kind of.

396
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,960
Why didn't you sell something of yours,

397
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,700
like your signed Moses Malone jersey?

398
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,110
Dude, I could never sell that.

399
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,190
I'd miss it too much.

400
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,480
You know what, even with all the crap you do,

401
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:09,970
I still look up to you.

402
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,550
Not anymore.

403
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,960
Adam, wait.

404
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,810
It was game over for my brother.

405
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,990
He'd hit rock bottom and finally ran out of options...

406
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,760
And quarters.

407
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,260
After watching her date get arrested,

408
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,940
Erica had to call home for a ride.

409
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,260
There you are.

410
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,940
Your mom and I couldn't decide

411
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,160
who you'd be more annoyed to see.

412
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:36,530
We talked about it for a while, and here I am.

413
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,460
Good.

414
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,990
'cause I don't ever want to talk to her again.

415
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,740
Stupid, beautiful podiatrist's son.

416
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,260
Your mom means well.

417
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,500
Um, we're not gonna be eating anything.

418
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,840
Thank you. Yeah.

419
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:51,660
But the thing is --

420
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,880
If you're gonna say another lame dad clich?

421
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,490
I will literally press your face

422
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,190
against this hot, sizzling grill.

423
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,550
No, no, I believe you.

424
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,460
But I really want you to hear this.

425
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,600
Hey, um, listen, you don't understand.

426
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,150
I'm trying to talk to my --

427
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
Is that shrimp?

428
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,510
All right, you know what, I'd love some shrimp,

429
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,270
but keep the schtick down.

430
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
So, when I was your age,

431
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:15,400
my first girlfriend dumped me out of the blue.

432
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:18,610
I spent the whole summer with the shades drawn,

433
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,660
eating zagnut bars, and watching old horror movies.

434
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:24,570
I was miserable and heartbroken.

435
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,640
Knock it off.

436
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,570
The point is that I know there's no easy fix here,

437
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,420
but all you need is time.

438
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,690
How much time?

439
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,890
I don't know.

440
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,330
But I promise you that one day you're gonna wake up,

441
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,480
and it just won't hurt as much.

442
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,620
I hope so.

443
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,500
Thanks, daddy.

444
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,980
Really? I helped you?!

445
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,860
Yeah, I am just as surprised as you are.

446
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,300
Well, you're gonna be just fine.

447
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,440
You are. And just remember --

448
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,650
It's getting kind of loud, all right?

449
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,220
It's still -- it's not, uh...

450
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,900
I don't think he understands.

451
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:02,750
Little did we know

452
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,550
Erica wasn't the only one ready to accept some help.

453
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,000
Hi.

454
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,240
My name is Barry Norman Goldberg.

455
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,170
- I'm addicted to arcade games. - We don't want to hear it.

456
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,450
Hey, cut him some slack, kiddo.

457
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,660
The first step is admitting you got a problem.

458
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,180
And I think I can help you.

459
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,610
There you go.

460
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,450
What the hell is that for?

461
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,690
You love that boxing game, right?

462
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,750
Why not try the real thing?

463
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,370
I don't know, pops.

464
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,450
It's not the same.

465
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,160
Save you a lot of quarters.

466
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,840
I certainly don't look bad doing this.

467
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,080
What just happened?

468
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:54,300
The trick with any addiction

469
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,240
is replacing it with a healthy alternative.

470
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,760
That's the thing about family --

471
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:01,440
No matter what, they're always there for you.

472
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,990
I know this may sound crazy,

473
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,000
but I'm pretty sure I'm gonna become champion of the world.

474
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,510
Even when you're at your worst.

475
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,230
Well, how'd it go? Was she mad? How mad was she?

476
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,660
Does she hate her mama?

477
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:17,600
Huh, relax. I think she's starting to feel better.

478
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,410
This feels right!

479
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,830
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

480
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,960
Erica, stop.

481
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,250
Really?

482
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,600
What? She's healing.

483
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,690
What is going on?!

484
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,080
The wind!

485
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,720
We'll write you a check.

486
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,110
We'll write you a check.

487
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,870
Sometimes you need them to bail you out.

488
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,940
And sometimes you need them to not say a thing.

489
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,440
They just need to be there.

490
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,790
Turns out my dad was right.

491
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,740
All Erica needed was a little time.

492
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,180
One day, she woke up and

493
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,660
it just didn't hurt anymore.

494
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,200
That's the great thing about first loves.

495
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,880
They're not the last.

496
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,050
And just like that...

497
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,410
...the age of darkness was over.

498
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,560
As for Barry, he went from scrounging for change...

499
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,650
to making some changes.

500
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,270
I want to buy that spaceship back.

501
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,140
$50.

502
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,980
I was afraid this might happen.

503
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:20,800
How much will you give me

504
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,510
for this signed Moses Malone jersey?

505
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,320
My falcon! You got it back?!

506
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,840
Dude! Get off me!

507
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,180
If you touch my torso again,

508
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,840
I will smash your spaceship with my hands.

509
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,900
- Hey, chewbacca! - Yo, nerd!

510
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:47,170
Every Rocky needs his Mickey. Come train me.

511
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,650
Come on.

512
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,950
Sure I got my millennium falcon back,

513
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,290
but more importantly...

514
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,350
...Barry was back to being Barry.

515
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,290
And this game of "Punch-out!!" 

516
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,190
beat every arcade in town.

518
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,490
I'm on filming now.

520
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,350
The ultimate in four-wheel drive.

522
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,060
Ginny, I think it's a good thing

523
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,290
that Drew and Erica didn't work out, you know?

524
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,400
The last thing we need

525
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:23,570
is their relationship to come between us, you know?

526
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,670
Totally.

527
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,690
Can I tell you something,

528
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,320
but you have to promise not to tell another soul?

529
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,530
I would never.

530
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,610
Tracy kissed John Martino.

531
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,480
Drew is a mess,

532
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:34,580
and now he won't even use his water-park pass.

533
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:35,870
Oh, my god.

534
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,690
So awful.

535
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,910
Are you -- are you walking faster?

536
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,730
No, are you slowing down?

537
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,880
Stop -- stop picking up the pace, Bev.

538
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:47,980
Stop it!

539
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,120
You are clearly going to tell Erica!

540
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,850
I can't hear you. You're too far behind.

541
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,050
You're running!

542
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,620
You're running!

543
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:57,540
Stop running!

544
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,770
This is just my natural gait.
