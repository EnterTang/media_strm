1
00:00:40,824 --> 00:00:45,227
- Home to America, Mr Potocki?
- Not a moment too soon.

2
00:01:12,889 --> 00:01:15,016
Poor bastard.

3
00:01:37,113 --> 00:01:40,446
Here's 50 peso.
Buy yourself some WD-40.

4
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:11,271
Oh, for cryin' out loud.

5
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,145
Listen, fella, l already gave.

6
00:02:18,087 --> 00:02:20,920
Do you understand English?

7
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,848
Long flight, huh?
Bombay to DC?

8
00:02:54,824 --> 00:03:00,285
You know, l always wondered.
Do they serve, like, lndian food on the plane?

9
00:03:01,531 --> 00:03:04,864
lf there's anything else
l can do for you, sir...

10
00:04:55,144 --> 00:04:59,911
- The things that land in your in-box, huh?
- Good morning. l'm sorry l'm late.

11
00:04:59,983 --> 00:05:02,816
l didn't see the case file yet.
The traffic's terrible.

12
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:07,253
Takes longer to get crosstown
than it does a plane ride from lndia.

13
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:10,486
Which is where our victim
flew in from last night - Bombay.

14
00:05:10,593 --> 00:05:13,585
- Who are we talking about?
- Hugh Potocki.

15
00:05:13,663 --> 00:05:16,564
lmporter/exporter from Minneapolis.
Laid over in DC.

16
00:05:16,632 --> 00:05:18,998
All this blood drains from his body.

17
00:05:19,102 --> 00:05:21,900
- Did the ME see it? The body?
- Yeah.

18
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:26,635
Tox test ruled out hemorrhagic fever,
Ebola, anything exotic.

19
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:30,110
Something killed this man,
but it wasn't any foreign disease.

20
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:31,942
- No sign of forced entry?
- No.

21
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:34,609
No one was seen
comin' or goin' from this room.

22
00:05:34,684 --> 00:05:40,452
The maid found the body 20 minutes after
a bellman left Mr Potocki. lt happened fast.

23
00:05:40,523 --> 00:05:43,515
So what you're saying is
that nobody knows anything.

24
00:05:43,626 --> 00:05:47,153
But then l guess
that's why it's in your in-box.

25
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:55,126
So what do you think, Agent Scully?
Haunted hotel room?

26
00:05:55,204 --> 00:05:58,173
Alien invaders? Sloppy vampires?

27
00:06:00,476 --> 00:06:05,106
There is one small thing.
The cops missed it their first time around.

28
00:06:09,485 --> 00:06:14,684
- A child's print.
- Yeah. That's what it looks like.

29
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,629
There was a ring of thieves
when l was back in New York.

30
00:06:20,696 --> 00:06:23,494
They used kids for B and E jobs.

31
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:26,660
Squeezin' in through cracked windows,
that kind of thing.

32
00:06:26,736 --> 00:06:29,000
But this, this is beyond.

33
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:32,371
No. From what l see, Agent Doggett,

34
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,069
from the way this man died,

35
00:06:35,178 --> 00:06:37,510
l doubt it was a kid who did this.

36
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,515
Thanks. l'm not ready
to lose all my faith in humanity.

37
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:43,416
But regardless,

38
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,920
l'd say it's wise you keep an open mind.

39
00:06:51,461 --> 00:06:57,093
The better the economy gets,
the harder it is to fill these kinds ofjobs.

40
00:06:58,267 --> 00:07:02,863
And the problem is that people look at it
as just a pay check.

41
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:06,170
They don't realize that,
as Maintenance Engineer,

42
00:07:06,242 --> 00:07:09,405
you are playing an important part
in these kids' lives.

43
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,776
And l can't tell you how wonderful it is

44
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:16,284
to find someone as enthusiastic
as you are, Mr Burrard.

45
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:22,180
And l understand you can start immediately?

46
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:29,458
That's wonderful.

47
00:07:35,138 --> 00:07:40,474
- Big fella, isn't he?
- Big is a relative term, Agent Doggett.

48
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,569
lt took three strong men
to wheel him in here.

49
00:07:44,647 --> 00:07:47,582
He tipped the scale at 402 pounds.

50
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,778
Hugh Potocki was a big man
with big appetites.

51
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,913
Loved big cars, big houses,
big business.

52
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:59,292
Divorced twice. He carried two alimonies,
one with child support.

53
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:04,492
Never missed a payment. ln fact,
he seems to have spoiled his wives and kids.

54
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,162
- l'm missing the point.
- lt seems he loved big women too.

55
00:08:09,272 --> 00:08:11,604
Considering the evidence and motives,

56
00:08:11,674 --> 00:08:14,939
we can probably rule out
his ex-wives as suspects.

57
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:19,141
Well, considering what l found here today,
l'd say l have to agree.

58
00:08:23,853 --> 00:08:29,086
Tissue damage. Massive trauma
to the lower intestine and the rectal wall.

59
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:32,150
ls that from something
goin' in or comin' out?

60
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:36,288
Unfortunately, there's so much damage
that it's hard to tell.

61
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:42,033
l took MRls, which reveal further shredding
throughout the abdomen

62
00:08:42,138 --> 00:08:44,766
and into the stomach area.

63
00:08:47,343 --> 00:08:51,780
lndia's a major transit point
for the golden triangle.

64
00:08:51,847 --> 00:08:55,613
This guy flew in and out of lndia
a half-dozen times over the past 18 months.

65
00:08:55,685 --> 00:09:00,884
Are you suggesting that he's a mule? A
courier of heroin or opiates? A drug dealer?

66
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,791
Fills a latex balloon with heroin, swallows it.
We've all seen this kind of thing before.

67
00:09:05,861 --> 00:09:08,659
But what if somebody got to him en route,

68
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:13,794
forcibly extracted the drugs,
tearin' it from his stomach?

69
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:18,499
l'd say that's a good theory, Agent Doggett.
Not to mention a graphic one.

70
00:09:18,574 --> 00:09:22,977
But there would have been traces left
of drugs in his system.

71
00:09:23,045 --> 00:09:26,811
Nor does it account for the blood loss
that this man experienced.

72
00:09:26,882 --> 00:09:30,750
Then we're right back where we started.
Nobody knows anything.

73
00:09:30,853 --> 00:09:32,878
Not exactly.

74
00:09:33,556 --> 00:09:38,220
l ran a decay analysis
to determine the time of death.

75
00:09:38,894 --> 00:09:43,490
Liver temperature, buildup of gases,
extent of rigor - routine stuff.

76
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:47,662
lt's not 100 per cent accurate,
but it gives us a range.

77
00:09:47,737 --> 00:09:51,833
- What's the range?
- 24 to 36 hours.

78
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,776
Well, that's just wrong.

79
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,213
lt would mean that Mr Potocki here
would have died before he left Bombay.

80
00:10:01,284 --> 00:10:05,618
No. lt would mean that a dead man
boarded a plane in lndia,

81
00:10:05,721 --> 00:10:08,918
changed planes in Paris,
hailed a cab at Dulles

82
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:12,586
and then checked into a downtown hotel
and tipped the bellman.

83
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:16,358
ln my experience, dead men don't tip,
Agent Scully.

84
00:10:16,432 --> 00:10:18,525
l told you to keep an open mind.

85
00:10:34,483 --> 00:10:36,815
- Look what you did to my scooter.
- lt's mine.

86
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:39,911
- Yeah, right.
- You gonna take it from me?

87
00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:42,457
Hey.

88
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,618
Leave him alone.

89
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,253
What's goin' on here, Quinton?

90
00:10:49,498 --> 00:10:53,127
l know you. Your name's Trevor?

91
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:58,263
You're in seventh grade, right? Got nothing
better to do than pick on sixth graders?

92
00:10:58,341 --> 00:11:00,172
- He ran into me.
- Liar.

93
00:11:00,276 --> 00:11:02,141
Enough.

94
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:05,236
You wanna be a bully?
Find somebody your own age.

95
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:09,747
l'll talk to your father if l have to.

96
00:11:10,486 --> 00:11:12,579
Come on, Quinton.

97
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:48,546
Yes. Thank you.

98
00:11:48,657 --> 00:11:50,989
Sorry to wake you.

99
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,119
Goodbye.

100
00:11:53,195 --> 00:11:55,629
- Bad connection?
- Consulate in New Delhi.

101
00:11:55,698 --> 00:12:01,728
Three weeks ago an American businessman
was found dead in his hotel room. Look.

102
00:12:01,837 --> 00:12:06,536
A Mr Albert Brecht of Spokane.
The reports were hard to piece together.

103
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:10,203
The medical records are in Hindi.
The death certificate's in Farsi.

104
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:15,716
And the news accounts are in...
l don't know, letters l've never seen before.

105
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:21,713
But l did get you a translation
of Mr Brecht's autopsy results.

106
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:27,726
lnternal trauma.
Tearing in the abdomen.

107
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,732
You're the doctor. lt sounds like
the same MO, doesn't it, Agent Scully?

108
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,701
Look at this.
Brecht's passport was a recent issue.

109
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,830
lt has his weight at 205 pounds.

110
00:12:37,907 --> 00:12:40,171
Whereas here, an lndian medical examiner

111
00:12:40,242 --> 00:12:44,736
has him listed at 238 pounds
just two hours after his death.

112
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:49,682
Well, if there's one thing people lie about,
it's their weight.

113
00:12:49,752 --> 00:12:55,122
That's a pretty big lie.
l mean, that's a 33-pound discrepancy.

114
00:12:55,224 --> 00:12:58,250
Well, he was a big man, that's for sure.

115
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,261
Yeah.

116
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:04,059
As was our DC victim.

117
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,602
All the better for accommodation.

118
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:14,038
Accommodation?

119
00:13:16,979 --> 00:13:22,611
Well, something has to account
for the weight gain, Agent Doggett.

120
00:13:25,454 --> 00:13:34,795
What if whatever it is that killed these men
entered and exited them of its own free will?

121
00:13:37,266 --> 00:13:42,329
l mean, something small, with small hands,

122
00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:52,244
living inside the victims
as a stowaway of sorts.

123
00:13:54,116 --> 00:13:58,678
You know l agree that having an open mind
is important to crime solving, but

124
00:13:58,787 --> 00:14:05,522
this theory of yours requires an openness
that l'm just not comfortable with.

125
00:14:05,628 --> 00:14:09,120
l understand, Agent Doggett.

126
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:11,792
And l can't prove it,

127
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:17,828
but l bet that if we had weighed Hugh Potocki
when he first arrived here from Bombay,

128
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,000
that he would have been
33 pounds heavier than his corpse.

129
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:26,605
lt's a theory, Agent Scully, but to my mind -
and pretty much the rest of me -

130
00:14:26,682 --> 00:14:29,116
it doesn't work.

131
00:14:29,184 --> 00:14:32,119
l appreciate your resistance.

132
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,890
But so far this evidence supports it.

133
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:39,289
Except one thing.

134
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:46,298
Even if there was something living inside of
Hugh Potocki when he arrived from Bombay,

135
00:14:46,368 --> 00:14:49,394
you said that Mr Potocki was already dead.

136
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,161
Dad.

137
00:15:23,238 --> 00:15:25,433
Dad? Dad. Dad. Dad.

138
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,673
- Quint, what is it?
- There's a man in here.

139
00:15:28,744 --> 00:15:31,269
What?

140
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:35,942
- What are you talking about?
- He was here, Dad. Right over there.

141
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:38,747
- He had no legs.
- Quinton.

142
00:15:41,757 --> 00:15:43,725
Quinton, listen to me.

143
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:49,059
Things that you imagine,
things that you dream, they're not real.

144
00:15:50,065 --> 00:15:54,729
- And what's not real can't hurt you.
- But, Dad, it was real. lt was.

145
00:15:54,803 --> 00:15:57,772
Quint, there's nobody here.

146
00:16:02,945 --> 00:16:05,937
Try to get some sleep. OK?

147
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,281
Dad?

148
00:16:57,866 --> 00:16:59,959
Dad?

149
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,480
The first dead body l saw,
l was 19 and a marine.

150
00:17:55,724 --> 00:17:58,557
This boy... Criminy.

151
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,651
Yeah.

152
00:18:01,864 --> 00:18:05,823
- That's not all he claims he saw.
- That's what the cops told me.

153
00:18:05,901 --> 00:18:09,166
That's why l thought
we should come down here.

154
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:13,937
He said he called his dad in
because there was something in his room.

155
00:18:14,743 --> 00:18:19,339
l asked him to describe it.
He said that it was a munchkin.

156
00:18:21,283 --> 00:18:23,877
That it had no legs.

157
00:18:23,952 --> 00:18:27,786
And that it was keeping itself up
with its arms.

158
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:33,921
That's a pretty good trick,
considering what l just found upstairs.

159
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:39,524
Palm prints in the boy's bedroom. They
match the ones we found in Potocki's room.

160
00:18:39,601 --> 00:18:43,594
And that's the good news.
ltjust doesn't serve your theory.

161
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:46,868
Because this thing didn't get in here
in anybody's body.

162
00:18:46,942 --> 00:18:51,311
- lt came in through the bedroom window.
- How can you be sure?

163
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:55,713
There was another print on the sill
outside the locked window.

164
00:18:55,784 --> 00:18:58,412
Somebody must have closed it after it got in.

165
00:18:58,487 --> 00:19:02,981
Right. Which is exactly what
the boy said that his father did.

166
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,791
But it's the father
that l have a problem with here.

167
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:12,765
He had none of the massive hemorrhaging
that we found in Mr Potocki.

168
00:19:12,835 --> 00:19:18,603
The coroner's initial report makes it sound
like the guy died of a cerebral embolism.

169
00:19:18,674 --> 00:19:23,304
The one salient detail
in the external exam are the eyes,

170
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,343
in which all of the blood vessels are broken.

171
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,955
Unless that's just the first stage.

172
00:20:28,877 --> 00:20:31,539
This is Special Agent Dana Scully.

173
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:37,916
l am a medical doctor about to perform
an unauthorized procedure on a body.

174
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,517
The subject is a Caucasian male.

175
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:47,217
Age. l don't remember
at this particular time.

176
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,162
His height is about six feet.

177
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:58,836
And his weight is
quite possibly subject to change.

178
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:04,611
l suppose distension could be due
to decomposition gases.

179
00:21:12,054 --> 00:21:14,852
But that seems unlikely.

180
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:12,539
Reliability is one of the most
important parts of yourjob.

181
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:17,043
We were very worried
when you didn't show up this morning.

182
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:19,963
They're called fakir, ascetic masters bound
to acts of self-torture to attain enlightenment.

183
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:25,745
We shot this video when l was travelin'
through lndia in the '70s.

184
00:24:25,814 --> 00:24:28,942
Oh, man, look at my hair back then.

185
00:24:29,484 --> 00:24:32,578
Agent Mulder consulted
with Dr Burks on occasion.

186
00:24:32,654 --> 00:24:35,555
l admit that l've been
skeptical of him in the past,

187
00:24:35,624 --> 00:24:37,922
but he does have certain insights.

188
00:24:37,993 --> 00:24:40,154
Well, we could use some insights.

189
00:24:40,996 --> 00:24:46,298
Well, l'm embarrassed to admit, but l'm not
sure l know what the heck's goin' on here.

190
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:49,666
These ascetic masters - they have abilities?

191
00:24:49,771 --> 00:24:53,730
Absolutely. And abilities similar to those
you told me about on the phone

192
00:24:53,808 --> 00:24:57,437
have been ascribed to
what are known as siddhi mystics.

193
00:24:57,512 --> 00:25:03,576
The siddhi are a very mysterious
and particularly powerful order of fakirs.

194
00:25:03,652 --> 00:25:08,248
These siddhi, they pass on their
secret practices from father to son,

195
00:25:08,323 --> 00:25:11,349
gaining occult powers with each generation.

196
00:25:11,459 --> 00:25:14,326
- What kind of powers?
- Powers of the mind.

197
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:16,954
Powers that help them manipulate reality.

198
00:25:17,032 --> 00:25:20,866
Powers that allow them
to become invisible or tiny as an atom.

199
00:25:20,969 --> 00:25:25,770
Well, l hope they're tiny -
where whoever it is is goin'.

200
00:25:27,842 --> 00:25:33,872
Chuck, could one of these siddhi mystics
make you believe that he vanished in a room

201
00:25:33,982 --> 00:25:36,507
when in fact he's standing
right in front of you?

202
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,951
Totally. Or disguise themselves,

203
00:25:40,021 --> 00:25:43,616
appearing in front of you as,
well, virtually anyone.

204
00:25:45,393 --> 00:25:48,851
l'm sorry, Dr Burks,
you're a professor of what?

205
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:53,230
l run the Advanced Digital lmaging Lab
at the University of Maryland.

206
00:25:53,335 --> 00:25:55,200
And l dabble.

207
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,294
You dabble?

208
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:04,406
Well, this has been insightful.

209
00:26:07,415 --> 00:26:11,511
- Doesn't surprise me.
- What?

210
00:26:11,586 --> 00:26:15,716
lt's hard to believe in something
when you can't understand it.

211
00:26:22,764 --> 00:26:25,597
- Get outta here.
- Just let me talk to you.

212
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,691
- Let me alone.
- l wanna say l'm sorry.

213
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:31,170
- No, you're not.
- No, l am. Would you just listen?

214
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,241
l'm sorry about your dad.

215
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,883
l think l know who did it.

216
00:27:12,147 --> 00:27:14,081
Agent Scully?

217
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:18,483
Chuck. Thank you for
coming down here again.

218
00:27:18,586 --> 00:27:21,453
Not at all. l was just a little curious.

219
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:25,219
l mean, it's always Mulder
who'd been doing all the calling and...

220
00:27:25,293 --> 00:27:29,127
This case. l'm just...

221
00:27:29,964 --> 00:27:33,627
l'm trying to see it
the way that Mulder would, and...

222
00:27:34,636 --> 00:27:36,831
- Please, have a seat.
- Of course.

223
00:27:36,938 --> 00:27:39,566
So, what seems to be the problem?

224
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:47,911
You described these siddhi mystics
as being religious men.

225
00:27:47,982 --> 00:27:52,476
Extremely. They believe their powers
derive directly from the divine.

226
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:58,025
So, presumably, using those powers
for murder would be in opposition of that?

227
00:27:58,126 --> 00:28:02,927
Worse. lt would violate
the very foundation of ascetic life.

228
00:28:02,997 --> 00:28:06,023
lt would endanger their eternal soul.

229
00:28:07,168 --> 00:28:15,166
Which got me thinking that if these siddhi
hold so fast to their orthodoxy,

230
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:20,111
then what would cause them
to break their faith?

231
00:28:20,548 --> 00:28:23,449
- l don't know.
- Something human.

232
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,512
Revenge?

233
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:29,783
Maybe.

234
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:38,024
This is an American chemical plant
in a village in lndia called Vishi.

235
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:42,035
lt's just outside of Mumbai,
which is better known to us as Bombay.

236
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:45,402
About six months ago
the plant inadvertently released

237
00:28:45,507 --> 00:28:49,375
a small cloud of methyl isocyanate gas.

238
00:28:50,678 --> 00:28:55,206
118 of Vishi's mostly indigenous
population were killed.

239
00:28:55,884 --> 00:28:58,375
But it wasn't very well reported over here.

240
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:03,014
l spent all night cross-checking
the victims of the disaster.

241
00:29:03,091 --> 00:29:07,221
And one finally caught my attention.

242
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:10,520
Now, it's... Oh, here.

243
00:29:10,598 --> 00:29:12,896
lt's an 11-year-old boy

244
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:17,938
whose father is described as being
a holy man of the Chamar caste.

245
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:20,405
The beggar caste.

246
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:24,911
Fakirs and mystics are,
well, often of low birth.

247
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:29,848
Do you think that this boy's father could be
a siddhi mystic like you described?

248
00:29:29,918 --> 00:29:35,618
He could be. But if he's out for revenge, then
why is he killing the people that he's killing?

249
00:30:15,463 --> 00:30:18,125
What's the matter with you?

250
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,666
Nothing.

251
00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:24,227
Trevor. Where are you going?
Dinner's on the table.

252
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,638
Trevor?

253
00:30:30,812 --> 00:30:32,905
Trevor, dinner.

254
00:30:35,149 --> 00:30:37,140
Trevor.

255
00:30:42,357 --> 00:30:43,585
Trevor.

256
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,680
Excuse me.

257
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:31,835
She came out to call her son in for dinner.

258
00:31:33,207 --> 00:31:35,505
That's all we know.

259
00:31:35,577 --> 00:31:38,239
What are we doin' here? Cos l'm not sure.

260
00:31:38,346 --> 00:31:41,338
What are we doing?

261
00:31:41,416 --> 00:31:47,218
A woman died of mysterious circumstances
not three blocks away from a previous victim.

262
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:50,485
External signs are a direct match.

263
00:31:51,893 --> 00:31:55,192
- That woman's eyes.
- l saw her eyes.

264
00:31:55,263 --> 00:31:59,563
But dollars to doughnuts, there wasn't
anything that crawled up inside her.

265
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,828
l think we're reachin' here.

266
00:32:01,903 --> 00:32:05,361
Maybe you're seein' things
that you wanna see.

267
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,207
- Are you questioning my integrity?
- No, l'm questionin' the whole damn case.

268
00:32:10,278 --> 00:32:14,009
From your so-called expert,
to the evidence you've chosen to ignore,

269
00:32:14,082 --> 00:32:17,848
to the fact that your approach has got us
no closer to a pattern or a motive

270
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,116
or even catchin' this killer
than we were when we started.

271
00:32:21,222 --> 00:32:23,452
l asked you to keep an open mind.

272
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:28,791
Yeah, well, l try to keep an open mind,
but it tends to shut my eyes.

273
00:32:28,896 --> 00:32:31,592
There is something here, Agent Doggett.

274
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,262
And l'll admit that it's hard to accept.

275
00:32:36,137 --> 00:32:41,268
But there is a motive and there is a pattern
and there is a reason.

276
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:45,306
And we will see it.

277
00:32:45,413 --> 00:32:47,472
But not working like this.

278
00:32:48,116 --> 00:32:50,209
Yeah, well.

279
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,619
l hope somebody sees it.

280
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,556
Trevor?

281
00:33:07,935 --> 00:33:11,462
- Trevor, l'm Dana Scully...
- What happened?

282
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:15,099
- Your father's in the house. l'm gonna take...
- Where's my mom?

283
00:33:15,176 --> 00:33:17,804
Trevor.

284
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:20,506
He was here.

285
00:33:20,615 --> 00:33:22,674
The little man.

286
00:33:22,784 --> 00:33:26,515
l saw him. He followed me.

287
00:33:47,675 --> 00:33:50,803
Agent Doggett? Where is he?

288
00:33:50,878 --> 00:33:52,869
ls that him?

289
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:56,643
lf you mean the janitor,
yeah, that's him, right in there.

290
00:33:56,718 --> 00:33:59,687
Agent Scully called and said that

291
00:34:00,855 --> 00:34:04,689
you had arrested what might be an
honest-to-goodness siddhi mystic.

292
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,953
Agent Scully jumped the gun on that one.

293
00:34:07,028 --> 00:34:12,193
The only thing extraordinary about this man
is he doesn't speak, to anyone.

294
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,291
Where is Agent Scully?

295
00:34:14,368 --> 00:34:18,236
She left, after four hours
of attempting to interrogate this guy.

296
00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:22,173
Unless he jumps up and does something
mystical in the next ten minutes,

297
00:34:22,243 --> 00:34:24,507
we're releasin' him.

298
00:34:27,215 --> 00:34:29,843
- What are you doin'?
- The man sitting there

299
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:32,909
may not be the man sitting there.

300
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:37,255
No one may be there at all, in fact.

301
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:41,688
Not in the next ten minutes, there ain't.

302
00:34:44,065 --> 00:34:46,158
Oh, wow.

303
00:34:47,368 --> 00:34:49,529
Agent Doggett?

304
00:34:50,938 --> 00:34:53,907
You gotta take a look at this.

305
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:16,527
Come on. lt's a trick.

306
00:35:16,597 --> 00:35:19,430
Yeah, but not of the camera.

307
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:31,372
Wait, if he's not there...

308
00:35:31,445 --> 00:35:34,107
He could be anywhere.

309
00:35:41,455 --> 00:35:44,390
- Yes?
- Sir, l am so sorry to bother you again.

310
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:48,918
- l know this has been a terrible ordeal.
- Yes. What is it you need?

311
00:35:48,996 --> 00:35:52,397
l need to speak
with your son Trevor again.

312
00:35:52,466 --> 00:35:54,627
ls this about his mother?

313
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:57,727
Well, Trevor told me that he saw a man.

314
00:35:57,805 --> 00:36:02,833
There's just something that doesn't quite
add up, and l need to be certain.

315
00:36:04,345 --> 00:36:07,007
Thank you.

316
00:36:07,114 --> 00:36:08,741
Scully.

317
00:36:08,816 --> 00:36:12,752
l think you ought to get back here,
Agent Scully. There's somethin'...

318
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:17,519
- What?
- The janitor, he's here but he's not.

319
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:19,752
l can't explain it.

320
00:36:19,827 --> 00:36:23,024
- Trevor's not in his room.
- Just hang on one second.

321
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:27,362
Agent Doggett,
what do you mean, he's not there?

322
00:36:31,539 --> 00:36:34,099
- Who's that?
- Hello?

323
00:36:39,847 --> 00:36:42,008
Mr Burrard.

324
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:46,644
l thought you... Well, l didn't expect
to see you back at work.

325
00:36:55,162 --> 00:36:58,825
This is the agent who picked him up before.

326
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,926
Can you make this call?

327
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,841
Here he comes.

328
00:37:47,415 --> 00:37:50,407
Trevor? Are you there?

329
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,832
- Get out of there.
- The windows are locked.

330
00:38:39,934 --> 00:38:41,993
Break 'em, OK?

331
00:39:07,128 --> 00:39:09,153
l'll get help.

332
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,370
- Oh, thank God.
- Do something.

333
00:39:24,178 --> 00:39:26,874
Quinton, what's the matter?

334
00:39:30,384 --> 00:39:33,979
lt's him. lt's the little man.

335
00:39:34,055 --> 00:39:37,047
Who? Trevor?

336
00:39:37,158 --> 00:39:41,117
All right, now, you boys,
you just stop playing around.

337
00:39:41,195 --> 00:39:43,288
OK, don't move.

338
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:48,363
- Stay where you are.
- Wait, what are you doing?

339
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,699
Stop him. Shoot him.

340
00:39:55,209 --> 00:39:56,699
l can't.

341
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:13,422
- Oh, my God.
- What is it? What happened?

342
00:40:13,527 --> 00:40:15,586
Agent Scully?

343
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:19,155
Scully?

344
00:41:13,954 --> 00:41:16,650
You gonna be OK, Agent Scully?

345
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:21,661
l got a drift of what happened
in there to you.

346
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,622
l mean, sorta.

347
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,836
l shot a young boy.

348
00:41:39,013 --> 00:41:42,073
The good news is, you're wrong.

349
00:41:44,451 --> 00:41:47,147
But it's what l saw.

350
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,452
With my eyes, anyway.

351
00:41:53,327 --> 00:41:57,286
Do you know what it's like
not to be able to trust your own eyes?

352
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,435
Then why'd you shoot him?

353
00:42:14,181 --> 00:42:17,116
Because it's what the boy saw.

354
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:23,154
And in an instant,

355
00:42:24,191 --> 00:42:29,151
l realized that it's what Mulder
would have seen, or understood.

356
00:42:30,164 --> 00:42:33,497
Because that's just how he came at things -

357
00:42:33,567 --> 00:42:36,661
withoutjudgment and without prejudice,

358
00:42:36,737 --> 00:42:40,969
and with an open mind
that l am just not capable of.

359
00:42:49,183 --> 00:42:52,414
lt's been a long night.

360
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:55,420
Give yourself a break.

361
00:42:56,924 --> 00:43:00,189
This whole thing didn't make any sense.

362
00:43:02,029 --> 00:43:04,088
No.

363
00:43:05,232 --> 00:43:07,325
lt did.

364
00:43:10,271 --> 00:43:13,001
ln some way, it did.

365
00:43:26,053 --> 00:43:27,680
No, thanks.

366
00:43:57,084 --> 00:44:00,542
