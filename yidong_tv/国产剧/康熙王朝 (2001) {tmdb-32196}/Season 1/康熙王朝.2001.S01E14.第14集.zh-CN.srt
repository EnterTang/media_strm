1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,313
lt's just senseless.
A man so young as Ray.

2
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:12,823
lt's God's cruel trick, Nora.

3
00:00:12,896 --> 00:00:16,992
Don't go blaming God, Curt.
You and l know what killed Ray.

4
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:21,003
Well, we don't know anything for sure.

5
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:26,566
How does a 41-year-old man
just wither away and die?

6
00:00:26,643 --> 00:00:31,239
lf any of us knew that,
we'd have done somethin' about it.

7
00:00:32,248 --> 00:00:35,115
Maybe it was just his time.

8
00:00:35,185 --> 00:00:38,985
He was a young man
when he went over, Curt.

9
00:00:39,055 --> 00:00:43,389
- Ray got sick because he fought in the Gulf.
- Now, don't go there, Nora.

10
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,224
You just make it worse.
The doctors never said...

11
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,163
They never said. That's right.

12
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:54,594
My husband's dead, and no one knows why.

13
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:57,606
Maybe l have to find out myself.

14
00:01:00,844 --> 00:01:03,540
They're gonna pay for Ray's death,
whoever's to blame.

15
00:01:03,613 --> 00:01:06,946
No one's to blame. You're just upset.

16
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:12,650
- You need a good night's sleep.
- l don't wanna sleep, l just...

17
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,525
You just want Ray back.

18
00:01:17,594 --> 00:01:20,290
We all do.

19
00:01:20,864 --> 00:01:24,265
Get some rest. l'll see you tomorrow, OK?

20
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:46,007
Ray?

21
00:03:54,884 --> 00:03:58,149
The car's registered
to a Curtis Delario, local address.

22
00:03:58,221 --> 00:04:00,689
So far he's been unreachable.

23
00:04:00,757 --> 00:04:05,319
lt's highly unlikely that wherever he is,
he feels like picking up the phone.

24
00:04:05,395 --> 00:04:10,458
Muncie PD ran some calculations. Based on
distance traveled and length of skid marks,

25
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:15,732
the car was going at least 40 when it impacted
the object, which, according to their math,

26
00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:20,833
would require something 4300 times
the density of steel to cause this damage.

27
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,071
Hm.

28
00:04:23,146 --> 00:04:25,512
lt's interesting, isn't it?

29
00:04:25,581 --> 00:04:28,448
l mean, in light of the evidence.

30
00:04:48,438 --> 00:04:52,898
From their size and shape,
these look like men's shoes.

31
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:57,777
l hope you're not suggesting that what this
car hit was a man, because there's no way.

32
00:04:57,847 --> 00:05:01,578
Well, these impressions in the asphalt
look pretty fresh to me.

33
00:05:01,651 --> 00:05:05,917
l admit to the coincidence, but you know
as well as l that if a man were here,

34
00:05:05,989 --> 00:05:09,390
he'd be splattered,
and there's just no evidence of that.

35
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:13,122
You're right.
Which is suspicious in and of itself.

36
00:05:13,196 --> 00:05:19,294
This car definitely hit something, and the only
evidence that we have are these two prints.

37
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:28,710
l hate to ruin your beautiful theory with
ugly facts, but stop to examine the incident.

38
00:05:28,778 --> 00:05:31,770
lf a man were standing here,
the driver would have stopped.

39
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:33,941
lt looks like he tried to.

40
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:38,113
lf a man were in the middle of the road
with a car coming, wouldn't he try to move?

41
00:05:38,187 --> 00:05:40,712
Unless he wanted to stop the car.

42
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:44,351
Yes, but if nothing less than
a block of steel could stop this car,

43
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:48,989
then, ipso facto, it could not have been
a man standing in the street last night.

44
00:05:49,065 --> 00:05:51,727
Or certainly no ordinary man.

45
00:05:56,506 --> 00:06:00,203
Just tell me what happened.
Where is he? Where...?

46
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,540
Excuse me, ma'am.

47
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,876
John Doggett with the FBl.

48
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:08,314
- You know about this?
- What happened? Where is he?

49
00:06:08,384 --> 00:06:12,150
- Curtis Delario, you know him?
- He was a friend of my husband's.

50
00:06:12,221 --> 00:06:15,952
- They worked at the salvage yard.
- l want you to calm down, Mrs...?

51
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:19,825
Pearce. How am l supposed to calm down?
Finding this now, it...

52
00:06:19,896 --> 00:06:23,388
- We're not even sure he was driving the car.
- He was.

53
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,299
He came over after my husband's funeral,
then he left...

54
00:06:26,369 --> 00:06:28,530
Agent Doggett.

55
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,110
Meet Curtis Delario.

56
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:48,683
l guess he won't be much help
clearing any of this up.

57
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:02,264
l think l got some answers.

58
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:07,139
So do l. lt wasn't the crash
that killed Curtis Delario.

59
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:11,010
He was badly injured,
but he was clearly still alive

60
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,414
when his body was pulled
through the car's windshield.

61
00:07:15,485 --> 00:07:16,679
Pulled?

62
00:07:16,752 --> 00:07:21,951
Yeah. These five deep puncture marks
match five fingers of one hand.

63
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:26,154
- You mean someone reached right in and...?
- Like a bowling ball.

64
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:30,757
- That seems humanly impossible.
- Certainly for any ordinary man.

65
00:07:32,768 --> 00:07:39,799
From the evidence l've gathered, the man
that did this is actually less than ordinary.

66
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:45,304
l was able to reconstruct a section of the
windshield and lift a print from the glass.

67
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:48,782
- Whose?
- Raymond Aloysius Pearce.

68
00:07:48,851 --> 00:07:53,083
Husband of Nora Pearce,
woman l spoke with at the accident site.

69
00:07:53,156 --> 00:07:55,954
Her recently deceased husband.

70
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,759
Well, if he was recently deceased,
then it must have been an old print.

71
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:06,860
Well, what you would think, except along with
the print, there was evidence of fresh blood.

72
00:08:06,936 --> 00:08:09,928
And it belongs to Ray Pearce too.

73
00:09:32,121 --> 00:09:33,554
Mrs Pearce.

74
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:38,822
Agent Doggett again. Sorry to bother you,
but there are some things l need to go over.

75
00:09:38,894 --> 00:09:42,159
- Everything all right, Nora?
- He's with the FBl.

76
00:09:42,231 --> 00:09:47,760
This is Harry Odell. He runs
the salvage yard where Ray and Curt worked.

77
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,032
May l come in?

78
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:57,636
Agent Doggett, l don't understand.

79
00:09:57,713 --> 00:10:03,049
Before, you were talking about Curt.
Now you wanna talk about Ray?

80
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:05,610
What was their relationship, Mrs Pearce,

81
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,555
your husband and Curtis Delario -
outside of work?

82
00:10:08,624 --> 00:10:13,687
l know what their relationship is now.
They're both dead.

83
00:10:13,763 --> 00:10:18,826
Your husband's medical record says that
he died after a long, debilitating illness?

84
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:21,369
Gulf War syndrome.

85
00:10:21,437 --> 00:10:26,932
No one will cop to that, but l aim to
prove it. Put the blame where it belongs.

86
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:31,503
l'm having trouble proving
something myself, Mrs Pearce.

87
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:36,449
You signed a form to have your husband
cremated, but it appears it never happened.

88
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:39,147
What do you mean?

89
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:42,554
They gave me the ashes.
They were at the funeral.

90
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:46,789
l can't find a record of Ray's body
ever even being at the crematorium.

91
00:10:46,862 --> 00:10:51,629
Oh, for cryin' out loud.
Hasn't this woman grieved enough?

92
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:56,900
Let me get to the point, Mrs Pearce.
ls it possible your husband is still alive?

93
00:10:56,972 --> 00:10:59,406
Still alive?

94
00:10:59,475 --> 00:11:03,241
- ls this ajoke?
- Because we have evidence to suggest

95
00:11:03,312 --> 00:11:08,579
that maybe your husband was involved
in the death of Curtis Delario.

96
00:11:08,651 --> 00:11:10,642
Are you saying Ray faked his death?

97
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,384
We found Ray's blood
and fingerprints on Curt's car.

98
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,886
l watched him die.

99
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:25,195
l nursed him when he was sick,
when he couldn't eat.

100
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:31,297
What you're saying is impossible. He couldn't
even walk or lift his head at the end.

101
00:11:35,344 --> 00:11:37,642
Ray Pearce worked for me nine years.

102
00:11:37,713 --> 00:11:41,809
He was a good man.
He never raised a hand to anyone.

103
00:12:07,543 --> 00:12:10,376
Hey. How you doin'?

104
00:12:11,614 --> 00:12:14,777
Ray, right? They said you're new.

105
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:18,110
Rough night?

106
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,946
You're eating the tinfoil on the...

107
00:12:29,565 --> 00:12:32,693
My name's Larina. l help out around here.

108
00:12:32,768 --> 00:12:35,828
You might have some questions
about how it all works.

109
00:12:35,905 --> 00:12:39,306
l don't know. lt's pretty basic.

110
00:12:42,812 --> 00:12:44,973
Look.

111
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:49,817
l've been down the road and back a few times

112
00:12:49,885 --> 00:12:54,720
and l just wanna say you're not alone, Ray.

113
00:12:55,224 --> 00:13:01,561
l mean, l've been where you've been
and sometimes it can help.

114
00:13:02,598 --> 00:13:04,463
You know?

115
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,127
Sometimes it's good to just talk.

116
00:13:08,137 --> 00:13:10,401
Make a connection.

117
00:13:10,473 --> 00:13:13,840
You know what l'm sayin', Ray?

118
00:13:14,743 --> 00:13:18,474
So if there's anything
l can do for you, you know...

119
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:21,277
You can leave me alone.

120
00:13:23,819 --> 00:13:25,150
OK.

121
00:14:36,692 --> 00:14:38,853
God Almighty.

122
00:14:40,596 --> 00:14:41,790
Ray.

123
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:44,162
lt's true.

124
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:50,632
Oh, you got everybody wonderin', man.

125
00:14:50,706 --> 00:14:55,734
And they're lookin' for you.
They blame you for killing Curt.

126
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:59,042
Now, me and Curt, we're your friends.

127
00:14:59,114 --> 00:15:03,016
You can't blame this on us.
You gotta believe me, it wasn't us.

128
00:15:03,085 --> 00:15:07,385
Well, l can show you.
lt's right here, Ray. lt wasn't me.

129
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,727
This time you stay dead.

130
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,357
Scully.

131
00:16:26,435 --> 00:16:30,201
Did you find anything to go along
with those holes in Curt Delario's head?

132
00:16:30,272 --> 00:16:33,298
Paint on his hands and nails?

133
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,208
- Paint?
- Blue paint, specifically.

134
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:38,439
Hang on.

135
00:16:44,153 --> 00:16:47,054
No. ls it significant?

136
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:50,614
l don't know.
But Harry was a busy boy last night.

137
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:53,355
He must've left Nora Pearce's
right after l saw him,

138
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,694
right after he'd learned
that Ray Pearce might still be alive.

139
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:57,959
To do what?

140
00:16:58,033 --> 00:17:02,868
lt's pretty clear he was in his office shredding
papers when he was surprised by someone.

141
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:07,534
- And you think it was Ray?
- Well, somebody took a blast.

142
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:11,272
There's blood all over the doors,
trailing down the stairs.

143
00:17:11,346 --> 00:17:15,612
- Massive blood loss.
- But the man with the gun is dead.

144
00:17:15,684 --> 00:17:18,949
l saw guys take hits in the war
that kept right on fighting,

145
00:17:19,021 --> 00:17:22,320
holding their insides in their hands.
lt's not impossible.

146
00:17:22,391 --> 00:17:25,827
But to do this to a man's head
after taking two barrels of buckshot...

147
00:17:25,894 --> 00:17:28,260
Or being hit by a car.

148
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:31,822
l don't see how a man could possibly do this.

149
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,630
Well, maybe the question's not how, but why.

150
00:17:34,703 --> 00:17:40,232
l mean, if Ray Pearce did indeed kill
this man, what would be his reason?

151
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,870
l'm not sure.
but l know where to start lookin'.

152
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,195
Hello?

153
00:18:46,975 --> 00:18:48,806
Ray?

154
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,584
Ray. You OK?

155
00:19:09,998 --> 00:19:13,365
Somebody saw you come in
with blood on you.

156
00:19:14,636 --> 00:19:17,264
l can see it on your clothes.

157
00:19:20,142 --> 00:19:22,303
Look, Ray.

158
00:19:23,045 --> 00:19:27,573
l know it never does anybody any good
getting the cops involved, OK?

159
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:30,243
Look, l've been there, man.

160
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:34,312
l know what it's like to feel dark and alone.

161
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:38,555
l can get a doctor for you.

162
00:19:38,627 --> 00:19:41,755
Get out.

163
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,997
Get out.

164
00:19:48,503 --> 00:19:50,334
OK.

165
00:19:52,307 --> 00:19:54,070
OK.

166
00:19:58,413 --> 00:20:04,318
They're called ''smart metals''. The idea is to
one day build things that are indestructible.

167
00:20:04,386 --> 00:20:08,413
Cars, equipment, built of alloys
with molecular memory.

168
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,948
lf damaged, they'd rebuild
into their original forms.

169
00:20:12,027 --> 00:20:14,154
All by themselves?

170
00:20:15,163 --> 00:20:19,566
- That's amazing.
- And right now, a metallurgist's pipe dream.

171
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:23,230
But beside the point of your visit,
l would imagine.

172
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:29,210
Well, you tell me. l found a document at
a crime scene listing Chamber Technologies.

173
00:20:29,278 --> 00:20:33,942
An employee number on the document
was assigned to a Dr David Clifton.

174
00:20:34,016 --> 00:20:36,678
Dr Clifton's no longer here.

175
00:20:37,686 --> 00:20:41,588
- What happened to him?
- He left the company.

176
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,751
l'm actually his successor in this department.

177
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:49,661
Do you deal with a man named Harry Odell
or a business called Southside Salvage?

178
00:20:49,731 --> 00:20:52,928
No, l don't deal with materials.
Nor did Dr Clifton.

179
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,799
Our work here is all theoretical.

180
00:20:55,871 --> 00:20:59,204
We have an environmental manager
in charge of waste management,

181
00:20:59,274 --> 00:21:05,110
but disposal is done at TSD facilities,
definitely not city salvage yards.

182
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:09,241
- Thanks for your time, Doctor...
- Puvogel. German, no h.

183
00:21:09,318 --> 00:21:13,618
- You need me to spell it for you?
- No, no. That's quite all right.

184
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,350
Thanks.

185
00:21:21,964 --> 00:21:25,422
- Scully.
- Hey. lt's Agent Doggett.

186
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,958
- l'm at Chamber Technologies.
- Did you find Dr Clifton?

187
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:33,599
He's left the company, but his successor
says his work was entirely conceptual.

188
00:21:33,675 --> 00:21:37,475
- Everything's done on computers.
- What kind of conceptual work?

189
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:40,310
Thing called smart metals.
lt's pretty incredible.

190
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:44,011
Metal alloys designed to rebuild themselves.

191
00:21:44,086 --> 00:21:46,247
l wonder.

192
00:21:46,321 --> 00:21:50,883
As it happens, Ray Pearce's illness
is pretty incredible, too.

193
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:53,519
l've reviewed Ray's medical records
from the VA.

194
00:21:53,595 --> 00:21:57,395
What his wife was calling Gulf War syndrome
is nothing of the kind.

195
00:21:57,466 --> 00:22:03,837
His entire cellular makeup was affected by
exposure to a non-identifiable contaminant.

196
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,896
A metal.

197
00:22:05,974 --> 00:22:09,910
What are you sayin'? Ray Pearce
has become some kind of metal man?

198
00:22:09,978 --> 00:22:13,072
That only happens in the movies,
Agent Scully.

199
00:22:13,148 --> 00:22:15,673
Does it, Agent Doggett?

200
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:20,450
Tell you what. l'll press this guy here
a little more on the issue.

201
00:22:20,522 --> 00:22:26,017
Maybe there's a reason why he's
not being perfectly forthcoming.

202
00:22:36,004 --> 00:22:39,735
Police are seeking clues in
last night's bloody robbery and murder

203
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:42,140
at Muncie's Southside Salvage.

204
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:46,647
Workmen found the body of 53-year-old
Harry Odell outside his office

205
00:22:46,715 --> 00:22:49,548
at approximately 7:30 this morning.

206
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:53,520
Detectives have refused to comment on
the cause of death pending an autopsy,

207
00:22:53,588 --> 00:22:57,991
but sources close to the case describe this
as a vicious and grisly attack.

208
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,996
Robbery appears to be
the motive behind this...

209
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:09,635
- Operator 525. What city, please?
- Muncie.

210
00:23:09,704 --> 00:23:11,934
Number for a Raymond Pearce.

211
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:22,108
- Sorry l'm late.
- lt's all right.

212
00:23:22,184 --> 00:23:24,880
l just got the blood test back on Ray Pearce,

213
00:23:24,953 --> 00:23:28,445
and it was indeed the same Ray Pearce
pronounced dead three days ago.

214
00:23:28,523 --> 00:23:33,187
But that's not all. By all medical standards,
he should still be dead.

215
00:23:33,261 --> 00:23:38,198
His blood has enough metal alloy in it
to poison an elephant.

216
00:23:38,266 --> 00:23:41,326
Except that he's still a man,
and he'll act and think like one

217
00:23:41,403 --> 00:23:43,837
even if he is more powerful
than a locomotive.

218
00:23:43,905 --> 00:23:46,999
But then the question is, why kill his friends?

219
00:23:47,075 --> 00:23:51,603
l mean, if he was wronged somehow,
wouldn't he go to them for solace?

220
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,740
- l mean, to his wife, at least?
- That's why l was late.

221
00:23:54,816 --> 00:23:59,651
l asked myself that same question.
Ray was an outpatient at the VA.

222
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:03,817
He had a history of substance abuse.
Did some time for a couple of DUls.

223
00:24:03,892 --> 00:24:06,725
- This was ten years ago.
- Cleaned up his act.

224
00:24:06,795 --> 00:24:10,822
He met Nora and married her in '91,
checked into a rehab and got straight.

225
00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:15,859
This was a guy to root for, that overcame
adversity and made a life for himself.

226
00:24:15,937 --> 00:24:20,533
- Until three days ago.
- l've busted a lot of killers, Agent Scully,

227
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:23,305
and dollars for doughnuts, they fit a profile.

228
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:26,040
But the Ray Pearce in this file is no murderer,

229
00:24:26,114 --> 00:24:30,210
let alone a guy that would hunt down
his friends and crush their skulls.

230
00:24:30,285 --> 00:24:34,779
The man that we're speaking about
withstood impact from a speeding car,

231
00:24:34,856 --> 00:24:38,417
and two shotgun blasts at short range.

232
00:24:39,528 --> 00:24:41,860
Even if we can find him,

233
00:24:43,098 --> 00:24:45,566
who's to say we can stop him?

234
00:26:38,313 --> 00:26:41,840
- Make sure that door is secure.
- Dr Puvogel,

235
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:45,784
are you sure he can't
open that door from the inside?

236
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:49,051
l've got a manual override on the door.

237
00:26:57,132 --> 00:26:59,828
What the hell was that?

238
00:27:00,602 --> 00:27:02,695
Ray Pearce.

239
00:27:06,474 --> 00:27:09,602
The door is four inches thick.

240
00:27:10,745 --> 00:27:15,205
- l don't think it's gonna hold.
- You'd better hope it does,

241
00:27:15,283 --> 00:27:20,414
cos if it doesn't, he's coming after you,
and l don't know if we can stop him.

242
00:27:36,271 --> 00:27:39,240
Open it up.

243
00:27:39,307 --> 00:27:41,468
Get it open.

244
00:27:43,144 --> 00:27:47,240
There's a rupture in the chamber.
l don't believe this.

245
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:26,510
Agent Doggett.

246
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,287
Look at this. You see this?

247
00:28:35,163 --> 00:28:38,223
What is that? ls that blood?

248
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:40,961
Turning itself into metal.

249
00:28:46,908 --> 00:28:49,399
Get him out of the building.

250
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:54,676
- l didn't do anything to the man.
- You wanna argue, or go someplace safe?

251
00:28:54,749 --> 00:28:58,742
- Where's that? Where's safe?
- lt's not in here.

252
00:29:33,154 --> 00:29:35,645
My God.

253
00:29:35,723 --> 00:29:39,454
- lt's true.
- You shouldn't have come, Nora.

254
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,995
l shouldn't have come?

255
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,861
That's what you say to me?

256
00:29:48,136 --> 00:29:50,969
l'm your wife.

257
00:29:52,073 --> 00:29:55,474
l came here because you didn't come to me.

258
00:29:59,347 --> 00:30:02,077
l had to have some stranger tell me.

259
00:30:03,084 --> 00:30:05,917
Why didn't you come, Ray?

260
00:30:05,987 --> 00:30:08,717
Because l'm not me.

261
00:30:25,106 --> 00:30:27,472
l don't care what's happened.

262
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:30,136
Whatever it is, it's a miracle.

263
00:30:32,447 --> 00:30:35,041
Don't go.

264
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:42,647
- There's your miracle.
- Ray, let me help you.

265
00:30:43,491 --> 00:30:46,153
Please, let me help.

266
00:30:54,335 --> 00:30:57,771
They've got to pay for this.

267
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:00,774
They've all got to pay.

268
00:32:16,584 --> 00:32:19,246
Oh my God.

269
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:29,656
What's going on?
lt's not enough that my life's been threatened.

270
00:32:29,731 --> 00:32:33,690
- l'm being treated like a criminal.
- And not without cause.

271
00:32:33,768 --> 00:32:36,669
- Oh my God.
- Do you recognize this man?

272
00:32:37,338 --> 00:32:44,107
We're assuming you don't know
too many guys in this particular condition.

273
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:51,982
- lt's not what it looks like.
- ls this Dr David Clifton, your predecessor?

274
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:01,857
- Yes.
- You care to explain how he ended up

275
00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:04,489
in a Chamber Technology
hazardous waste barrel?

276
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,658
lt was his idea. l was against it.

277
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:12,229
lf you knew, you might've told me
about this when l first came to see you.

278
00:33:12,306 --> 00:33:15,935
He was dying, and he was afraid.

279
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:20,572
- Of what?
- That it would hinder progress, or halt it.

280
00:33:20,648 --> 00:33:24,049
- That it would finish us.
- Oh, you're finished.

281
00:33:24,118 --> 00:33:30,421
- One way or another, your work here is done.
- We didn't know this was gonna happen.

282
00:33:30,491 --> 00:33:36,862
We were just trying to push the envelope,
do the right thing for the company.

283
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:39,593
Then he got sick.

284
00:33:40,635 --> 00:33:47,507
He was working with an alloy
with a genetic algorithm built into it.

285
00:33:47,575 --> 00:33:53,070
lt converted electrical energy
into mechanical. Gave it memory.

286
00:33:53,147 --> 00:33:55,479
And it poisoned him.

287
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:59,418
We immediately shut down the project.

288
00:33:59,487 --> 00:34:02,456
But it was too late.

289
00:34:02,523 --> 00:34:05,253
He didn't have any family.

290
00:34:05,326 --> 00:34:11,356
His work was his life. He wanted to leave us
to continue working on the science.

291
00:34:11,432 --> 00:34:17,530
And to ship this barrel and body to Southside
Salvage, where it infected somebody else.

292
00:34:17,605 --> 00:34:20,836
l don't know how that happened,
l swear to God.

293
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:27,113
That barrel was supposed to go
to a designated site.

294
00:34:30,618 --> 00:34:33,382
Let me talk to you for a second.

295
00:34:40,261 --> 00:34:42,889
l think he's telling the truth.

296
00:34:43,898 --> 00:34:46,492
What the hell is she doing here?

297
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:53,031
- Who is it?
- Nora Pearce, Ray's wife.

298
00:35:13,161 --> 00:35:15,959
Mrs Pearce?

299
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,760
What are you doin' here?

300
00:35:19,801 --> 00:35:22,861
How do you know about this place?

301
00:35:22,937 --> 00:35:25,337
She was looking for something.

302
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:29,141
Who'd you call, Mrs Pearce?

303
00:36:19,227 --> 00:36:21,320
Let's check in here.

304
00:36:21,395 --> 00:36:24,057
Police.

305
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,805
- You want us to take her in?
- l want to talk to her.

306
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:38,141
Your husband just
broke through a second-storey wall

307
00:36:38,212 --> 00:36:41,704
and eluded a dozen cops at St Clare House.

308
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:44,649
That please you, Mrs Pearce?

309
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:50,248
Does it please you to know that he killed
a woman volunteer named Larina Jackson?

310
00:36:50,324 --> 00:36:55,261
That makes three people. Three people
that he's killed, and for what?

311
00:36:55,329 --> 00:36:58,093
Because they made him what he is.

312
00:36:58,165 --> 00:37:03,569
They say this young woman he killed tonight
had been concerned for him,

313
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,903
concerned for Ray's welfare.

314
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:12,344
Whatever Ray is, whatever he's become,
it was an accident.

315
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:18,117
- lt was not those people's fault, Mrs Pearce.
- Harry and Curt knew about it.

316
00:37:18,185 --> 00:37:23,350
No, they were innocent, just like Ray was.
They didn't know this was gonna happen.

317
00:37:23,424 --> 00:37:26,120
These people here knew.
They got documents on it.

318
00:37:26,193 --> 00:37:29,060
Oh, so that's what this is about?

319
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:32,964
This is about
looking for somebody to blame?

320
00:37:33,034 --> 00:37:37,494
Ray sent you here, didn't he,
to find that person, to get a name?

321
00:37:37,571 --> 00:37:40,563
The Ray l know died.

322
00:37:42,643 --> 00:37:46,875
- The man responsible should pay for that.
- So who is it?

323
00:37:47,481 --> 00:37:50,644
lt's the CEO here? The owner?

324
00:37:51,252 --> 00:37:55,018
Give us a name, Mrs Pearce,
before someone else has to die.

325
00:37:55,089 --> 00:37:57,922
l never gave him a name.

326
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:07,266
Get her outta here. Put her on 24-hour watch.

327
00:38:14,008 --> 00:38:17,000
We'll be right outside, ma'am.

328
00:38:35,529 --> 00:38:37,520
Nora?

329
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:42,794
- They're right outside, Ray.
- Did you get me the name?

330
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:45,668
You killed her.

331
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:49,904
The woman who called me.
For God's sake, Ray, why?

332
00:38:49,977 --> 00:38:52,810
Why her? She cared about you.

333
00:38:58,285 --> 00:39:00,719
l need the name.

334
00:39:00,788 --> 00:39:03,552
No one else needs to die, Ray.

335
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:10,494
You won't do it, not to me.

336
00:39:10,564 --> 00:39:13,055
l need the man's name.

337
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:21,871
- He's in the house.
- Go. Go.

338
00:39:38,325 --> 00:39:42,159
Tell the FBl agents it's Harris.
Ray made me give him the name.

339
00:39:42,229 --> 00:39:45,198
Owen Harris. Ray's gonna kill him.

340
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,024
No. Owen.

341
00:40:15,096 --> 00:40:17,257
No. No.

342
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:19,959
- Daddy.
- No.

343
00:40:20,701 --> 00:40:22,965
Owen Harris, don't look away.

344
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:27,997
- Look at me.
- Why are you doing this?

345
00:40:28,075 --> 00:40:31,238
Because you made me.

346
00:40:31,312 --> 00:40:35,874
- l don't know what you're talking about.
- Southside Salvage.

347
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:38,783
- l'm just an accountant.
- Daddy.

348
00:40:40,955 --> 00:40:43,287
Daddy.

349
00:41:54,195 --> 00:41:56,288
Ray Pearce.

350
00:41:57,731 --> 00:42:01,462
He came here to kill this man,
but something stopped him, didn't it?

351
00:42:01,535 --> 00:42:03,730
This man, Owen Harris.

352
00:42:03,804 --> 00:42:06,034
He begged for his life.

353
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:11,066
lt mightjust have saved him.
His attacker got up and ran away.

354
00:42:14,682 --> 00:42:20,348
Makes no sense. Pearce was a determined
killer, lookin' for someone to blame.

355
00:42:20,421 --> 00:42:22,651
Why stop here?

356
00:42:22,723 --> 00:42:27,319
Wherever Ray Pearce went,
the answer to that question went with him,

357
00:42:27,394 --> 00:42:31,057
but l can tell you
why he came after Owen Harris.

358
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:33,793
lt was his name Nora found in the file.

359
00:42:33,867 --> 00:42:38,566
He authorized the shipment of
hazardous materials to Southside Salvage.

360
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:43,099
But if Harris is the guy Ray
holds responsible, why'd Ray let him live?

361
00:42:43,177 --> 00:42:47,409
Well, l think that
Nora Pearce may have been right.

362
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:51,008
Her husband died, or at least his body did.

363
00:42:51,085 --> 00:42:54,987
Whatever killed those people
was an abomination of a man.

364
00:42:55,055 --> 00:42:57,956
- lt was a machine.
- A machine?

365
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,093
Come on. A machine
doesn't know blame, Agent Scully.

366
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:05,961
Nor mercy.

367
00:43:06,767 --> 00:43:11,101
Unless what drove Ray to kill
is also what saved those people.

368
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:16,273
Some flicker of humanity.

369
00:43:52,579 --> 00:43:56,345
