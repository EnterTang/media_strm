28
00:03:14,353 --> 00:03:15,478
Thank you very much.

29
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,316
I'll be waiting for your advise
how to find Lyagavy.

30
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,443
The main question is:

31
00:03:24,483 --> 00:03:31,488
if I re-register to him this grove
and all illegally taken Chermashnya,

32
00:03:31,529 --> 00:03:35,365
will Mr. Informer give me
three thousand in advance?

33
00:03:35,407 --> 00:03:38,283
How can I know that?

34
00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:42,369
Why do you call him Lyagavy?

35
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:45,413
His name is Gorstkin.

36
00:03:45,454 --> 00:03:51,374
He takes offend
when somebody calls him Lyagavy.

37
00:04:09,468 --> 00:04:11,386
He's drunk.

38
00:04:11,386 --> 00:04:13,388
Has been drinking all day long.

39
00:04:17,264 --> 00:04:19,224
What should I do now?

40
00:04:20,475 --> 00:04:23,310
I have very important
things to talk about with him.

41
00:04:23,393 --> 00:04:25,311
I need to come back tonight.

42
00:04:26,311 --> 00:04:28,312
I have to wake him up.

43
00:04:40,278 --> 00:04:42,362
You have to wait.

44
00:04:42,404 --> 00:04:44,363
He is out of form.

45
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:46,448
God!

46
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,407
I need to wake him up now.

47
00:04:50,326 --> 00:04:52,410
You can't imagine
how desperate I am.

48
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:56,371
He won't be able to talk tonight.

49
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:13,255
I have nothing to do but waiting.

50
00:05:13,297 --> 00:05:15,298
I'll start just when he wakes up.

51
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:19,217
I'll pay for the candle,
you won't forget Dmitri Karamazov.

52
00:05:19,468 --> 00:05:25,429
Good bye, I wish you to be
fully satisfied.

53
00:05:57,448 --> 00:05:59,407
This is so stupid.

54
00:06:01,283 --> 00:06:04,243
Disgracefully.

55
00:06:04,285 --> 00:06:05,411
What an absurd!

56
00:06:05,453 --> 00:06:10,246
My whole life depends on him,
and he is snoring here.

57
00:06:22,462 --> 00:06:24,296
This is Snegiryov!

58
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:26,381
Beat him!

59
00:06:27,215 --> 00:06:28,424
Beat him!

60
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:35,303
What do you think you're doing?

61
00:06:40,306 --> 00:06:43,350
Get out off here!
'll manage with them alone.

62
00:06:43,432 --> 00:06:45,393
Why do you throw stones in me?

63
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:48,352
Monk in silk trousers!

64
00:06:48,436 --> 00:06:50,354
Very well, I am going,
I don't want to tease you.

65
00:06:50,395 --> 00:06:52,313
I heard how they tease you.

66
00:06:52,355 --> 00:06:54,314
I don't want to. Good bye.

67
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,191
Aren't you ashamed?

68
00:07:00,192 --> 00:07:01,360
What are you doing?

69
00:07:03,403 --> 00:07:07,363
What have I done to you?

70
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:33,337
I'm sorry, I fell asleep.

71
00:07:43,175 --> 00:07:45,302
I'm lieutenant Dmitri Karamazov.

72
00:07:46,261 --> 00:07:51,305
You probably heard that I'm
an old man Karamazov's son.

73
00:07:51,347 --> 00:07:54,182
Whom you're buying the grove from.

74
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,308
You're lying.

75
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,351
Why are you saying that?

76
00:07:58,393 --> 00:08:01,186
You know Fyodor Pavlovitch, don't you?

77
00:08:01,228 --> 00:08:03,312
I don't know Fyodor Pavlovitch.

78
00:08:04,271 --> 00:08:07,314
You are buying the grove from my father.

79
00:08:07,356 --> 00:08:11,192
I'm ready to give you the rights
to the whole Chermashnya.

80
00:08:11,276 --> 00:08:13,235
And I'm ready to sign the papers now.

81
00:08:13,277 --> 00:08:15,320
Only for three thousand.

82
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,280
You're lying.

83
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:24,199
This is not a joke.

84
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:29,328
You are a dyer.

85
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,329
I am Dmitri Karamazov.

86
00:08:32,371 --> 00:08:35,123
And I came to you
with a profitable offer.

87
00:08:35,206 --> 00:08:37,124
Talking about that grove.

88
00:08:37,207 --> 00:08:38,249
Three thousand only.

89
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,208
No, you are a dyer.

90
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:43,210
You contracted with me.

91
00:08:43,252 --> 00:08:46,212
And you are a scoundrel.

92
00:08:51,382 --> 00:08:54,300
I assure you, Mr. Lyagavy,. .

93
00:08:54,342 --> 00:08:56,343
Why do you call me that?

94
00:08:57,219 --> 00:08:59,303
I'm not Lyagavy for you.

95
00:08:59,345 --> 00:09:02,180
I am Gorstkin! Gorstkin!

96
00:09:02,222 --> 00:09:05,265
- Do you understand that?
- I know you are Gorstkin.

97
00:09:05,307 --> 00:09:07,225
I am Gorstkin.

98
00:09:07,349 --> 00:09:09,226
God, what have I done?

99
00:09:09,226 --> 00:09:13,144
- You are Gorstkin?
- Yes, I am Gorstkin.

100
00:09:13,228 --> 00:09:15,145
And you are a dyer.

101
00:09:15,229 --> 00:09:17,230
Scum.

102
00:09:24,234 --> 00:09:27,194
He warned me. Gorstkin.

103
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,238
I am Gorstkin.

104
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:39,118
This is for overnight stay.

105
00:10:14,221 --> 00:10:16,306
My God, what despair!

106
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,182
What death all round!

107
00:11:41,147 --> 00:11:43,232
Alexey Fyodorovitch, I was expecting you.

108
00:11:43,315 --> 00:11:46,066
We have Ekaterina Ivanovna
and your brother here.

109
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,192
Not that horrible one.

110
00:11:47,318 --> 00:11:49,193
Ivan Fyodorovitch is here.
He is speaking with her.

111
00:11:49,235 --> 00:11:54,196
He is speaking with her
as if his heart is breaking.

112
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,240
Alexey Fyodorovitch,
why is Lisa in hysterics now?

113
00:11:57,281 --> 00:12:00,158
Once she heard you come,
she is hysterics.

114
00:12:00,158 --> 00:12:02,159
You are in hysterics, not me.

115
00:12:02,242 --> 00:12:04,285
I didn't know he was coming.

116
00:12:06,203 --> 00:12:08,204
What do you mean you didn't know.

117
00:12:08,246 --> 00:12:11,289
Yulee told you Alexey Fyodorovitch has come.

118
00:12:12,082 --> 00:12:13,207
She was on the watch.

119
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:17,168
Dear mother, this is not funny at all.

120
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,086
But if you want
to improve the situation,

121
00:12:19,169 --> 00:12:20,170
and you want to say something
very clever,

122
00:12:20,253 --> 00:12:23,296
say to this mister,
to Alexey Fyodorovitch,

123
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:27,132
that by coming here
after what happened yesterday,

124
00:12:27,174 --> 00:12:29,050
he proved his stupidity.

125
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:31,134
And he doesn't pay attention
to the fact that everyone is laughing at him.

126
00:12:32,177 --> 00:12:34,220
Lisa!

127
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:37,096
I'll finally resort to strong measures!

128
00:12:37,138 --> 00:12:42,099
Who is laughing at him?
Everyone needs him.

129
00:12:45,184 --> 00:12:47,269
Alexey Fyodorovitch, I am so upset.

130
00:12:48,061 --> 00:12:50,145
Her sickness, her whims,

131
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:54,023
and Dr. Gerzen can't understand
anything, and Ekaterina Ivanovna's tragedy,

132
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,148
this is so terrible!

133
00:12:55,231 --> 00:13:01,235
Excuse me, give me please some cloth.
I injured my hand and it hurts.

134
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:04,154
Here

135
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:07,072
My God! What a wound!

136
00:13:07,156 --> 00:13:09,281
A wound? Why didn't you say
anything about it?

137
00:13:10,074 --> 00:13:11,240
He could've blooded till death.

138
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:14,284
Yulya, get some water.
We need to water the wound.

139
00:13:15,076 --> 00:13:17,203
You need to put your hand
into cold water, so it won't hurt.

140
00:13:17,245 --> 00:13:20,247
Mommy, hurry. Find some water and a bowl.

141
00:13:21,038 --> 00:13:22,122
We need to send for a doctor.

142
00:13:22,206 --> 00:13:24,165
Your doctor will not
understand anything again.

143
00:13:24,207 --> 00:13:27,041
Where is that Yulya with water?

144
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:30,127
- Yulya, hurry!
- Mommy, please, go get it yourself.

145
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:32,086
Hurry, or I will die.

146
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:39,132
Mommy, bring some lint,
and that turbid liquid for cuts.

147
00:13:39,215 --> 00:13:43,218
I don't remember its name.
It's in your bedroom, in the right closet.

148
00:13:44,052 --> 00:13:46,178
I will bring it right away.
Don't be so loud.

149
00:13:46,219 --> 00:13:50,055
Look how firmly Alexey Fyodorovitch
bears his suffering.

150
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:53,099
Where did you manage
to injure yourself?

151
00:14:00,103 --> 00:14:03,063
Yulya, bring a clean handkerchief.

152
00:14:08,024 --> 00:14:10,234
Now quickly give my letter back.

153
00:14:11,234 --> 00:14:13,152
I don't have it with me.

154
00:14:13,236 --> 00:14:16,070
It's not truth. I knew
you'd say that. It's in your pocket.

155
00:14:16,112 --> 00:14:18,071
Give it to me right now.

156
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:19,197
I left it there.

157
00:14:19,239 --> 00:14:22,241
Then bring it to me today.
It was a joke.

158
00:14:23,032 --> 00:14:26,076
Do you hear me?
I repented this joke.

159
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:32,080
Did you laugh much at me?

160
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,040
Not at all.

161
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,041
Why not?

162
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:44,045
Because I believed your letter.

163
00:14:44,087 --> 00:14:46,130
- You are insulting me.
- No, I am not.

164
00:14:47,255 --> 00:14:51,091
Once I finished reading,
I realized this is the way it will be.

165
00:14:52,216 --> 00:14:55,218
The monastic elder ordered to leave
the monastery and to get married.

166
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,970
I realized there is no
better wife than you.

167
00:14:59,053 --> 00:15:02,180
When we come of age
we will definitely get married.

168
00:15:03,181 --> 00:15:05,974
I will love you.

169
00:15:09,017 --> 00:15:11,144
I'm a freak.
They carry me on a chair.

170
00:15:15,146 --> 00:15:17,147
I will carry you.

171
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:21,108
But I am sure
you'll get better by that time.

172
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:23,192
You are insane.

173
00:15:23,985 --> 00:15:26,070
What nonsense you
made out of that joke!

174
00:15:26,236 --> 00:15:28,111
Here is mommy.

175
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:31,072
Mom, what took you so long?
You are always late!

176
00:15:31,114 --> 00:15:32,990
Yulya has brought a handkerchief already.

177
00:15:33,073 --> 00:15:36,992
Lise, my head aches
because of your shouts.

178
00:15:37,034 --> 00:15:43,954
I remembered the name of that liquid.
It's called lead water.

179
00:15:45,122 --> 00:15:50,083
Mommy, can you imagine,
he had a fight with boys in the street.

180
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:52,959
And one boy bit his finger.

181
00:15:53,043 --> 00:15:55,128
Can he marry after that?

182
00:15:55,169 --> 00:16:00,089
Because, can you imagine,
mommy, he wants to marry me.

183
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,965
Isn't it funny?

184
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,091
What do you mean marry?

185
00:16:05,217 --> 00:16:08,051
It's not appropriate for you.

186
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,972
That boy can be rabid.

187
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:17,098
Mom, there are no rabid boys.

188
00:16:18,058 --> 00:16:19,975
They can be, Lise.

189
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:23,019
Maybe this is stupid.

190
00:16:23,061 --> 00:16:25,104
But your boy was bitten by a dog, wasn't he?

191
00:16:25,186 --> 00:16:27,063
So he became a rabid boy.

192
00:16:27,147 --> 00:16:29,106
And he bit Alexey Fyodorovitch.

193
00:16:29,148 --> 00:16:31,982
Aren't you afraid of it yourself?

194
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:33,108
Stop it, Lise.

195
00:16:34,025 --> 00:16:38,111
Maybe I shouldn't have said
about the rabid boy.

196
00:16:38,153 --> 00:16:40,987
But you shouldn't say that.

197
00:16:41,071 --> 00:16:45,030
Alexey Fyodorovitch, Ekaterina Ivanovna
found out that you are here,

198
00:16:45,065 --> 00:16:45,948
and she is waiting for you.

199
00:16:46,032 --> 00:16:49,992
Mom, tell her he can't see her.
He is in pain now.

200
00:16:49,992 --> 00:16:52,161
No I am not. I can go.

201
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:55,162
You really can?

202
00:16:55,997 --> 00:16:58,039
- Mom, he is a monster.
- Lise!

203
00:16:58,081 --> 00:17:01,958
I will come to you after that
and we will talk as long as you want.

204
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,960
- Mom, take him away!
- Lise, you are going mad!

205
00:17:10,005 --> 00:17:12,130
Let's go, Alexey Fyodorovitch,
I'm afraid of her.

206
00:17:14,966 --> 00:17:18,093
I don't want to anticipate,
but you will see anything by yourself.

207
00:17:18,135 --> 00:17:21,011
The most fantastic comedy
is happening there.

208
00:17:21,011 --> 00:17:23,096
Ekaterina Ivanovna loves
your brother Ivan Fyodorovitch,

209
00:17:23,178 --> 00:17:27,973
but she makes us believe
she loves your brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch.

210
00:17:28,015 --> 00:17:30,016
That is terrible!

211
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:36,019
Hello, Alexey Fyodorovitch.

212
00:17:36,145 --> 00:17:39,021
Ivan Fyodorovitch,
please stay just for one minute.

213
00:17:39,021 --> 00:17:41,940
I want to hear
Alexey Fyodorovitch's opinion.

214
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:49,068
Alexey Fyodorovitch, yesterday
you were a witness of that horror.

215
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:51,111
That is why I trust you.

216
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:55,072
Well, I don't know now
if I love Dmitri Fyodorovitch.

217
00:17:55,155 --> 00:17:58,033
He became pitiful for me,
but that's a bad sign.

218
00:17:58,073 --> 00:18:00,993
No, of course you don't love him.

219
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:05,161
Wait, I haven't said
what I have decided last night.

220
00:18:08,122 --> 00:18:10,081
My decision is:

221
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:22,004
even if he marries that bitch,
I will never leave him.

222
00:18:23,047 --> 00:18:27,007
I will be faithful to him
whole my life.

223
00:18:27,091 --> 00:18:30,051
In spite of what I bore yesterday.

224
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:34,970
And when he becomes
miserable with her,

225
00:18:35,012 --> 00:18:36,972
and that will happen for sure,

226
00:18:37,055 --> 00:18:38,931
he will come to me.

227
00:18:39,139 --> 00:18:42,141
He will see a friend in me.
He will see a loving sister.

228
00:18:42,934 --> 00:18:45,101
He will see a faithful person in me.

229
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:49,103
I will become means of his happiness.

230
00:18:49,145 --> 00:18:52,022
A tool... How to say that?

231
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:55,024
I will be an engine for his happiness.
And that will be for all his life.

232
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,026
That is my decision.

233
00:18:58,067 --> 00:19:00,985
And Ivan Fyodorovitch approves that.

234
00:19:04,071 --> 00:19:06,947
No, I just expressed my thoughts.

235
00:19:06,989 --> 00:19:13,034
Your life will be full of suffering.

236
00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:16,953
But with the lapse if time
it will become softer.

237
00:19:16,994 --> 00:19:23,081
And the rest of those feelings
will satisfy you most of all.

238
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:35,006
My God, this is so wrong.

239
00:19:37,965 --> 00:19:41,092
Why don't you say something,
Alexey Fyodorovitch?

240
00:19:54,100 --> 00:20:01,062
Well, tomorrow I will have to go
to Moscow and leave you for a long time.

241
00:20:02,063 --> 00:20:04,064
Tomorrow to Moscow? But...

242
00:20:07,065 --> 00:20:10,901
I am so happy.

243
00:20:10,942 --> 00:20:13,944
Not because you are leaving.

244
00:20:14,028 --> 00:20:18,072
You will tell aunt Iogasha my situation.

245
00:20:18,906 --> 00:20:20,949
All my horror.

246
00:20:21,031 --> 00:20:23,867
You are indispensable for me.

247
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:25,034
I am going to write a letter.

248
00:20:25,117 --> 00:20:31,079
What about Alexey Fyodorovitch's
opinion. You wanted to hear that badly.

249
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,956
I didn't forget.

250
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,999
Why are you so hostile to me?

251
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,084
I am listening to you,
Alexey Fyodorovitch.

252
00:20:40,876 --> 00:20:43,962
I haven't thought about it.
I couldn't imagine that.

253
00:20:44,962 --> 00:20:46,963
What?

254
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:51,842
He is going to Moscow,
and you said you were happy.

255
00:20:51,924 --> 00:20:56,052
You said that on purpose,
like you played it in a theatre.

256
00:20:57,928 --> 00:21:03,973
I know I shouldn't say that,
but I will say.

257
00:21:04,057 --> 00:21:07,809
You don't love my brother Dmitri
at the first place.

258
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:11,937
And maybe Dmitri doesn't love you either.
He just honors you.

259
00:21:13,062 --> 00:21:15,981
I don't know how dare I.

260
00:21:16,063 --> 00:21:22,067
But I must say the truth
because nobody wants to say it here.

261
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:23,985
What truth?

262
00:21:24,027 --> 00:21:28,863
Invite Dmitri here.

263
00:21:28,905 --> 00:21:31,948
Let him take your hand
and after that Ivan's hand.

264
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,991
And ask him to link your hands.

265
00:21:36,867 --> 00:21:39,994
You torture Ivan
only because you love him.

266
00:21:40,995 --> 00:21:43,955
But you don't love Dmitri,
you just convinced yourself in that.

267
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,793
You are a little prat!

268
00:21:53,836 --> 00:21:55,003
You are mistaken, my dear Alyosha.

269
00:21:56,087 --> 00:21:58,797
Ekaterina Ivanovna has never loved me.

270
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:00,924
She always knew I loved her.

271
00:22:01,006 --> 00:22:03,842
Even though I have never
said a word about my love.

272
00:22:03,842 --> 00:22:04,968
She knew that,
but she didn't love me.

273
00:22:05,885 --> 00:22:09,845
She kept me for continuous vengeance.

274
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:14,014
She took vengeance on me
for all insults she had from Dmitri.

275
00:22:14,848 --> 00:22:15,974
From their first meeting.

276
00:22:21,018 --> 00:22:25,979
Ekaterina Ivanovna,
you really love him.

277
00:22:26,896 --> 00:22:29,982
You love him for insulting you.

278
00:22:32,858 --> 00:22:35,901
If he reformed, you'd give him up at once.

279
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:40,822
You need him so as to contemplate
continually your heroic fidelity

280
00:22:40,863 --> 00:22:43,906
and to reproach him for infidelity.

281
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:48,992
And it all comes from your pride.

282
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:54,913
I don't want your hand.

283
00:22:55,872 --> 00:23:00,791
You have tortured me too deliberately for me
to be able to forgive you at this moment.

284
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:05,002
I shall forgive you later,

285
00:23:06,836 --> 00:23:08,921
but now I don't want your hand.

286
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:19,010
I don't need the reward.

287
00:23:32,018 --> 00:23:35,894
You did nothing wrong.
You were perfect.

288
00:23:37,937 --> 00:23:40,815
This is my fault. I started it.

289
00:23:40,856 --> 00:23:43,816
You saw that by yourself.
That was a laceration.

290
00:23:43,858 --> 00:23:46,818
Mom, why was he acting like an angel?

291
00:23:57,824 --> 00:23:59,909
I have a serious request for you,
Alexey Fyodorovitch.

292
00:23:59,992 --> 00:24:04,786
Your brother Dmitri offended a man.

293
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:07,955
He was angry,
but that offence was serious.

294
00:24:07,997 --> 00:24:10,831
The name of that man is Snegiryov.

295
00:24:10,915 --> 00:24:17,835
I'd like to ask you to visit him
and delicately give him this.

296
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,837
Two hundred roubles.

297
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,839
He will accept it for sure.

298
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:25,799
I mean to persuade him to accept it.

299
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:28,884
You are so excellent and kind.

300
00:24:32,969 --> 00:24:34,888
This is from me.

301
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,889
Not from Dmitri.

302
00:24:37,931 --> 00:24:42,850
Find him. He lives in Lake Street
in the house of a woman called Kalmikov.

303
00:24:42,934 --> 00:24:44,893
Do it please.

304
00:24:44,935 --> 00:24:46,853
Do it.

305
00:24:47,811 --> 00:24:49,771
Now I am tired. Good bye.

306
00:24:54,774 --> 00:24:58,818
Tears is a good sign.
This is wonderful, Alexey Fyodorovitch.

307
00:24:58,901 --> 00:25:01,777
Hurry up with that assignment.
And come back quicker.

308
00:25:01,777 --> 00:25:04,821
Liza, don't delay him here.

309
00:25:06,822 --> 00:25:10,866
No way. Not anymore.
Speak through the door now.

310
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:13,785
How have you come to be an angel?

311
00:25:17,912 --> 00:25:20,747
For an awful piece of stupidity, Lise!

312
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:26,918
Goodbye!

313
00:26:25,701 --> 00:26:27,786
It's a monk come to beg for the monastery.

314
00:26:27,828 --> 00:26:29,704
A nice place to come to!

315
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:37,709
No, Varvara Nikolaevna, you are wrong.

316
00:26:41,878 --> 00:26:44,796
Wrong guess.

317
00:26:51,801 --> 00:26:53,843
I came to discuss one business.

318
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:55,844
What business?

319
00:26:55,927 --> 00:26:59,680
Daddy, he came to complain of me.

320
00:26:59,721 --> 00:27:01,723
I bit his finger.

321
00:27:01,889 --> 00:27:05,808
So it is you whose finger he bit?

322
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,768
Yes, me.

323
00:27:07,851 --> 00:27:11,686
He was throwing
stones with other schoolboys.

324
00:27:11,895 --> 00:27:14,772
There were six of them against him alone.

325
00:27:14,814 --> 00:27:17,690
I went up to him,
and he threw a stone at me.

326
00:27:17,732 --> 00:27:18,899
I asked him what I had done to him.

327
00:27:19,691 --> 00:27:21,859
And then he rushed at me
and bit my finger badly.

328
00:27:24,694 --> 00:27:25,820
I'll thrash him.

329
00:27:25,862 --> 00:27:28,821
At once - this minute!

330
00:27:28,905 --> 00:27:30,864
But I am not complaining at all,

331
00:27:31,699 --> 00:27:34,783
I am simply telling you.
Besides, he seems to be ill.

332
00:27:35,743 --> 00:27:38,827
Do you suppose I'd thrash him?

333
00:27:38,911 --> 00:27:44,872
That I'd take my Ilyusha
and thrash him for your satisfaction?

334
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,833
No, sir.

335
00:27:52,877 --> 00:27:55,670
Instead of thrashing Ilyusha,

336
00:27:55,712 --> 00:28:01,799
I'll chop off my four fingers
with this knife here before your eyes.

337
00:28:02,758 --> 00:28:07,719
I should think four fingers would be enough
to satisfy your thirst for vengeance.

338
00:28:07,761 --> 00:28:10,721
You won't ask for the fifth one too?

339
00:28:18,767 --> 00:28:20,726
I think I understand it all now.

340
00:28:22,687 --> 00:28:24,854
He attacked me
as the brother of your assailant.

341
00:28:25,688 --> 00:28:26,731
I understand it.

342
00:28:26,813 --> 00:28:29,649
My brother regrets his action.

343
00:28:29,732 --> 00:28:32,858
He will ask
your forgiveness if you wish it.

344
00:28:33,651 --> 00:28:37,861
After pulling out my beard, you mean,
he will ask my forgiveness?

345
00:28:38,696 --> 00:28:40,780
He will do anything you like.

346
00:28:42,781 --> 00:28:48,785
So if I were to ask his highness
to go down on his knees

347
00:28:48,868 --> 00:28:53,871
before me in that very tavern,
he would do it?'

348
00:28:54,705 --> 00:28:56,664
Yes.

349
00:29:06,753 --> 00:29:10,755
Touched me to tears
and pierced me to the heart!

350
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:12,882
So leave off playing the fool!

351
00:29:13,633 --> 00:29:19,636
Did you hear that?

352
00:29:20,678 --> 00:29:25,765
Allow me to introduce...

353
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:29,850
Daddy, stop it! Some idiot comes in,
and you put us to shame!

354
00:29:30,642 --> 00:29:35,770
You see that?
That's her character.

355
00:29:36,813 --> 00:29:43,733
Now let me present you to my wife,
Arina Petrovna.

356
00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:50,779
Get up, mister Karamazov. You
must stand up to be introduced to a lady.

357
00:29:54,781 --> 00:29:57,617
It's not the Karamazov, mamma.

358
00:29:57,699 --> 00:29:59,660
It's his brother.

359
00:29:59,742 --> 00:30:02,786
Hello. Sit down, Mr. Tchernomazov.

360
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,829
Karamazov. Karamazov.

361
00:30:06,622 --> 00:30:09,790
We are of humble origin.

362
00:30:09,831 --> 00:30:13,584
Father.

363
00:30:13,626 --> 00:30:15,793
Sit down. Why has he pulled you up?

364
00:30:16,627 --> 00:30:20,755
My legs are swollen like
barrels, and I am shriveled up myself.

365
00:30:21,797 --> 00:30:25,758
When we were with the army,
we used to have many such guests.

366
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:31,636
I don't mean to make any
comparisons; everyone to their taste.

367
00:30:31,678 --> 00:30:33,637
The deacon's wife
used to come then and say,

368
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,597
Alexandr Alexandrovitch
is a man of the noblest heart,

369
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:40,683
but Nastasya Petrovna,'
she would say, 'is of the brood of hell.'

370
00:30:40,724 --> 00:30:45,769
'Well,' I said, 'that's a matter
of taste; but you are a little spitfire.'

371
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:49,647
'And you want keeping
in your place;' says she.

372
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:54,608
'You black sword,' said I,
'who asked you to teach me?'

373
00:30:54,691 --> 00:30:57,818
'But my breath,' says she,
'is clean, and yours is unclean.'

374
00:30:58,652 --> 00:31:01,612
And ever since then I had it in my mind.

375
00:31:01,695 --> 00:31:05,739
Not long ago I was sitting here
as I am now,

376
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:10,617
when I saw that very general
come in who came here for Easter,

377
00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:13,744
and I asked him :
'Your Excellency,' said I,

378
00:31:13,786 --> 00:31:16,704
'can a lady's breath be unpleasant?'

379
00:31:16,787 --> 00:31:20,622
'Yes,' he answered ; 'you ought to open
a windowpane or open the door,

380
00:31:20,664 --> 00:31:22,791
for the air is not fresh here.'

381
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:25,751
'I won't spoil the air,' said I,

382
00:31:25,834 --> 00:31:28,794
'I'll order some slippers and go away.'

383
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:34,672
My darlings, don't blame
your own mother!

384
00:31:34,756 --> 00:31:39,551
There's only Ilyusha who comes
home from school and loves me.

385
00:31:39,634 --> 00:31:42,636
Nikolay Ilyitch,
how is it I can't please you?

386
00:31:42,677 --> 00:31:45,804
Forgive your own mother -
forgive a poor lonely creature!

387
00:31:46,596 --> 00:31:48,556
Why has my breath
become unpleasant to you?

388
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:50,723
Mamma, my dear, give over!

389
00:31:50,765 --> 00:31:52,600
Father, how can you - with him!

390
00:31:53,684 --> 00:31:55,768
There, you see, you hear?

391
00:31:55,809 --> 00:32:00,688
Do give over fooling, showing off your
silly antics which never lead to anything!

392
00:32:00,771 --> 00:32:07,692
Your anger
is quite just this time, Varvara Nikolaevna,

393
00:32:07,734 --> 00:32:10,735
and I'll make haste to satisfy you.

394
00:32:10,819 --> 00:32:13,737
Come, put on your cap,
Alexey Fyodorovitch, and I'll put on mine.

395
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:16,571
We will go out.

396
00:32:17,823 --> 00:32:20,533
Let's go, Alexey Fyodorovitch.

397
00:32:20,615 --> 00:32:26,661
I have a word to say to you in earnest,
but not within these walls.

398
00:32:30,538 --> 00:32:35,667
Come along, Alexey Fyodorovitch,
we must make an end.

399
00:32:35,749 --> 00:32:38,543
Let's go.

400
00:32:56,678 --> 00:33:01,723
Your brother dragged me out of
the tavern into the market place.

401
00:33:01,807 --> 00:33:06,726
At that moment the boys were coming
out of school, and with them Ilyusha.

402
00:33:06,768 --> 00:33:11,521
As soon as he saw me
in such a state he rushed up to me.

403
00:33:11,562 --> 00:33:13,522
'Father,' he cried, 'father! '

404
00:33:13,564 --> 00:33:16,565
He caught hold of me,
hugged me, tried to pull me away,

405
00:33:16,648 --> 00:33:20,734
crying to your brother,
'Let go, let go, it's my father, forgive him! '

406
00:33:21,526 --> 00:33:22,693
Yes, he actually cried 'forgive him.'

407
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:29,531
He clutched at that hand,
that very hand, and kissed it.

408
00:33:29,614 --> 00:33:32,616
I remember his little face at that moment.

409
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,617
I haven't forgotten it and I never shall!

410
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:40,537
No, I will never forgive your brother.

411
00:33:40,579 --> 00:33:41,747
It was not only you
whom he insulted.

412
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,665
He has insulted his betrothed, too,
a noble-hearted girl.

413
00:33:44,748 --> 00:33:48,583
She commissioned me at once - just now -
to bring you this help from her.

414
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:49,626
Two hundred roubles.

415
00:33:49,709 --> 00:33:52,502
From her, as from a sister.

416
00:33:52,586 --> 00:33:53,628
Two hundred roubles?

417
00:33:53,712 --> 00:33:55,671
You must take them.

418
00:33:55,713 --> 00:33:59,590
Unless all men
are to be enemies on earth!

419
00:33:59,673 --> 00:34:02,633
You have a generous heart.
You must see that.

420
00:34:02,717 --> 00:34:07,719
Two hundred roubles! I haven't seen
so much money for the last four years!

421
00:34:08,554 --> 00:34:11,722
And she says she is a sister.
And is that the truth?

422
00:34:12,514 --> 00:34:13,598
I swear that all I told you is the truth.

423
00:34:14,723 --> 00:34:21,603
Two hundred roubles
mean a lot to me.

424
00:34:22,562 --> 00:34:29,691
I can look after mamma and Nina,
my hunchback angel daughter.

425
00:34:29,774 --> 00:34:32,609
Yes, yes, of course.

426
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,611
Katerina Ivanovna
will send you as much more as you need.

427
00:34:36,653 --> 00:34:37,737
And I have money too, take what you want,

428
00:34:38,529 --> 00:34:39,571
as you would
from a brother, from a friend,

429
00:34:39,613 --> 00:34:41,489
you can give it back later.

430
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:50,453
Wouldn't you like me
to show you a little trick I know?

431
00:34:50,537 --> 00:34:51,620
What trick?

432
00:34:52,496 --> 00:34:55,706
A pretty trick.

433
00:34:58,624 --> 00:34:59,708
Look.

434
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,668
Do you see, do you see?

435
00:35:05,545 --> 00:35:07,463
Look there!

436
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,547
So much for your money!

437
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:12,591
So much for your money!

438
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,676
So much for your money!

439
00:35:14,758 --> 00:35:22,555
What should I say to my boy if I
took money from you for our shame?

440
00:35:33,603 --> 00:35:35,646
Why have you come?

441
00:35:37,605 --> 00:35:39,606
To find out how you are.

442
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:42,483
You need not have troubled.

443
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:46,610
But I knew you'd
come poking in directly.

444
00:35:48,487 --> 00:35:51,655
Red's better.

445
00:35:54,615 --> 00:35:57,575
It's just like the hospital in a white one.

446
00:35:59,576 --> 00:36:01,452
No, red's better.

447
00:36:02,662 --> 00:36:05,454
Ivan's gone out.

448
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:13,501
He is doing his utmost
to carry off Mitya's betrothed.

449
00:36:13,668 --> 00:36:17,628
That's what he is staying here for.

450
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,671
Surely he did not tell you so?

451
00:36:20,505 --> 00:36:26,467
Yes, he did, three weeks ago.

452
00:36:27,509 --> 00:36:30,511
You don't suppose he too came
to murder me, do you?

453
00:36:31,512 --> 00:36:34,638
What do you mean?
Why do you say such things?

454
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:39,599
He must have had some object in coming.

455
00:36:41,517 --> 00:36:45,603
He doesn't ask for money, it's true,

456
00:36:46,478 --> 00:36:50,481
but yet he won't get
a farthing from me.

457
00:36:50,564 --> 00:36:55,525
Because, my dear Alexey Fyodorovitch,

458
00:36:55,651 --> 00:37:01,654
I want to pass for one
for another twenty years.

459
00:37:07,699 --> 00:37:13,577
As I get older, you know,
I shan't be a pretty object.

460
00:37:15,662 --> 00:37:22,458
The wenches won't come to me of their
own accord, so I shall want my money.

461
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,668
So I am saving up for myself.

462
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:33,422
For I mean to go on in
my sins to the end.

463
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:37,424
For sin is sweet.

464
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:42,427
All abuse it, but all men live in it.

465
00:37:42,553 --> 00:37:44,596
Only others do it on the sly.

466
00:37:44,678 --> 00:37:46,597
And I openly.

467
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:55,560
And your paradise is not to my taste.

468
00:37:55,644 --> 00:38:00,437
Even if it exists.

469
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:10,402
I believe that I fall asleep
and don't wake up again.

470
00:38:10,486 --> 00:38:12,487
And that's all.

471
00:38:13,654 --> 00:38:16,572
You can pray for my soul if you like.

472
00:38:16,614 --> 00:38:20,450
And if you don't
want to, don't, damn you!

473
00:38:20,533 --> 00:38:22,409
That's my philosophy.

474
00:38:22,451 --> 00:38:27,412
And I'll marry Grushenka
in a minute if I want to.

475
00:38:29,379 --> 00:38:38,384
For if you've money, you have only
to want a thing and you can have it.

476
00:38:39,217 --> 00:38:41,219
How cross you are!

477
00:38:41,302 --> 00:38:42,428
It's because of yesterday.

478
00:38:43,262 --> 00:38:44,429
You had better lie down.

479
00:38:45,388 --> 00:38:49,307
There! You say that,
and I am not angry with you.

480
00:38:51,224 --> 00:38:56,186
But if Ivan said it,
I should be angry with him.

481
00:38:58,354 --> 00:39:00,271
Won't you have a drop of brandy?

482
00:39:00,355 --> 00:39:08,277
Take some cold coffee and I'll pour...

483
00:39:08,317 --> 00:39:14,196
No, thank you.
I'll take that roll with me if I may.

484
00:39:15,197 --> 00:39:17,240
And you'd better
not have brandy, either.

485
00:39:24,411 --> 00:39:33,165
You are quite right, it irritates
my nerves instead of soothing them.

486
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,376
Only one little glass.

487
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:39,170
I'll get it out of the cupboard.

488
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:43,296
You see you are in a better humour now.

489
00:39:50,218 --> 00:39:53,219
I love you even without the brandy.

490
00:39:57,388 --> 00:40:01,266
But with scoundrels I am a scoundrel.

491
00:40:06,268 --> 00:40:08,311
I am an ill-natured man.

492
00:40:09,354 --> 00:40:13,189
You are not ill-natured, but distorted.

493
00:40:13,272 --> 00:40:18,275
Look what I wanted to ask you.

494
00:40:19,401 --> 00:40:28,281
If I were to hand
Mitya over a thousand or maybe two now,

495
00:40:30,282 --> 00:40:33,200
would he leave?

496
00:40:33,284 --> 00:40:35,327
Forever. Without Grushenka.

497
00:40:41,288 --> 00:40:43,289
If you would give
him three thousand, perhaps he...

498
00:40:43,289 --> 00:40:45,374
No! That's nonsense!

499
00:40:46,291 --> 00:40:50,127
You needn't ask him now, no need!
I've changed my mind.

500
00:40:50,294 --> 00:40:53,170
I want my money myself.

501
00:40:55,297 --> 00:41:00,133
I'll crush him
like a beetle without it.

502
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:03,343
You know how I crush
them at nights?

503
00:41:06,303 --> 00:41:08,179
And it cracks.

504
00:41:08,262 --> 00:41:11,222
And your Mitya will crack.

505
00:41:11,264 --> 00:41:14,140
Because you love him,
I can see that.

506
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:19,269
You can go. There's nothing
for you to do here to-day.

507
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:24,105
What's that for?

508
00:41:29,232 --> 00:41:31,275
We shall see each other again.

509
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,321
Or do you think we shan't?

510
00:41:39,155 --> 00:41:41,282
Not at all, I didn't mean anything.

511
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,159
You can go.

512
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,245
I did not mean anything either.

513
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:57,962
THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV

514
00:43:49,747 --> 00:43:52,045
End of Part Three
