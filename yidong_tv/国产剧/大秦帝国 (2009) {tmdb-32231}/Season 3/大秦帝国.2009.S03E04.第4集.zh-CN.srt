29
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,450
汤普森先生有话要说 
Mr. Thompson wants a word.

30
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,410
大家可能已经知道  
As some of you may know,

31
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,720
我们在塔博尔高地的联络人

34
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,090
死于一起悲惨事故

是来自纽约的吉普 罗塞蒂先生 
was a Mr. Gyp Rosetti of New York,

38
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,500
这事儿恐怕没这么简单 
it's quite possible there's a bit more to the story.

39
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,760
既然如此 除非另行通知  
That being the case,until further notice,

40
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:56,170
运给罗斯坦先生的货物都走备用线路 
all shipments to Mr. Rothstein will use back roads only,

41
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,450
全部避开塔博尔高地 
avoiding Tabor Heights altogether.

这是你的问题 对吧 
That's your problem,isn't it?

45

你确定要这么做吗 
You sure this is a good idea?

46
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,540
你问他干什么 
What the fuck you asking him for?

47
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,980
我觉得如果...
I just thought when it comes to...

48
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,950
如果怎么样 我已经说过怎么办了 
You just what? I already said how it is.

49
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,540
好的 纳吉 抱歉

54
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,370

去那儿  
Head up there,

56
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,930

64
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,670
我还不够忙吗 
I don't have enough on my mind?

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,930
难道我还得亲自检查你的工作 
I have to start checking your fucking work,too?

66
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,940
还要我操心吗 
Make sure things are being handled?

67
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,220
没有下次了 先生 
It won't happen again,sir.

68
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,330
找到这个人 如有必要 去找萨维奇探员 
Find this guy. Use Agent Sawicki if you have to.

69

要牵扯联邦调查局吗

70
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,980
给他报酬前 先让他出力

还有什么要说的 
Any more second-guessing?

72
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,710
我马上去办 
I'll get on it straightaway.

73
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,560
-纳吉 我能说句话吗  -什么事 
-Nucky,can I have a word? -About what?

如果你有抱怨 去找米奇

我现在回来了 
It's just that I'm back now.

78

我知道 
I'm well aware of that.

79
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,820
那别让我闲着 纳吉  
Then let me earn,Nucky.

80

我听你的话 服了刑 
I did my time like you asked.

81
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,620
有些事情先搞清楚 
Let's get something straight.

82
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,490
仅仅让你坐牢  
Allowing you to simply go to jail

83
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,780
是我给你的最后恩赐 
is the last gift I'll ever give you.

84
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:51,310
用词太不恰当了 
This is rather infelicitous language,isn't it?

85
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,220
-阴道  -这是医学用语 
-Vagina? -It is a medical term.

86
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,120
我向来不喜欢这个词的读音 
I've never enjoyed the sound of it.

87
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,830
我也不喜欢芽甘蓝  
I've never liked brussels sprouts,

88
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,040
但我不否认它们的存在 
but I don't deny they exist.

89
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,870
好独特的类比 
What a peculiar analogy.

90
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,720
你喜欢什么术语 
What term would you prefer?

91
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,220
整个领域都成问题 
The entire area is problematical.

92
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,740
你应该知道 有些主题
You do acknowledge certain subjects

93
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,890
不用术语 是无法讨论的吧

性交 受精 生育 
Intercourse,fertilization,birth.

95

你不觉得自己很坏吗 医生 
You imagine yourself quite wicked,don't you,Doctor?

96
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,850
坐在教室后面的顽童 
The jackanapes at the back of every classroom,

97
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,580
误将自己的窃笑当做大智慧 
mistaking his sniggering for the wit of the world.

98
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,660
你说的更像是我的表兄弟弗朗西斯 
That sounds more like my cousin Francis.

99
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,560
"怀孕" 
"Pregnant."

100
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,250
又一个问题领域吗 
Another problematical area?

101
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,110
"妊娠"听起来更稳妥 
"Gravid" has a noble ring.

102
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,700
她们能明白什么意思吗 
Will they even know what that means?

103
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,310
你不是打算教给她们吗 
Is it not your intention to instruct them?

104
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,890
"有孩子" 
"With child"?

105
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,270
"月事" 
"Monthly time."

106
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,750
连"月经"你也觉得不妥吗
You are at odds with "menstruation"?

107
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,320
-这可是很好的拉丁语  -令人遗憾的新词 
-It's good Latin. -A regrettable neologism.

108
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,920
联邦儿童局已经 
The Federal Children's Bureau

109
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,170
出版了一系列 
has already published a series

110
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,430
产前保健书籍 用的就是"月经" 
on prenatal care and "menstruation" is what they use.

111
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,170
政客们的草率 我不关心 
The indiscretion of politicians is of no concern to me.

112
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,890
我会旁听课程 
I will be attending the class

113
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,670
确保我的指示得到贯彻
to make sure my instructions are followed.

114
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,910
这些是
And these are?

115
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,060
给女士们的礼物
Gifts for the women.

116
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,010

修女 是卫生棉

118
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,400
这种东西在商店里公开售卖吗
These are sold openly in stores?

119
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,430
新上市的产品
They are a relatively new product.

120
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,750
或许您可以留一包...
Perhaps you yourself...

121
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:46,480
希望我们的晚班学员不要这样敏感
let's hope our evening students aren't quite so sensitive.

122
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,300
看来你径直走进了我的陷阱
Looks like you've stepped straight into my trap.

123
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,680
什么
What?

124
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:22,010
就像我要逮捕你那样
You know,like I was gonna arrest you.

125
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,840
为什么逮捕我
Why would you do that?

126
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,700
开个玩笑而已
Just making a little joke.

127
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,050
汤普森先生很忙
Mr. Thompson's a busy man.

128
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,680
反正没事干 开开玩笑罢了
I have nothing better to do?

129
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,190
大白天转悠到这了 对吧
Came out here in the middle of the day,didn't you?

130
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,010
这是罗兰 史密斯的地方吗
Is this Rowland Smith's place or not?

131
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,880
费城官方人士说是
That's what the Philly office says.

132
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,410
你跟其他探员提过吗
You spoke to other agents about this?

133
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,190
就一个
Just the one

134
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,450
我信得过的
that I can trust.

135
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,710
你指被你收买的那个
You mean the one that's crooked.

136
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,040
貌似锁上了
Looks like it's locked.

137
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,590
多谢你的说明
Thanks for clearing that up.

138
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,130
罗兰 史密斯很忙啊

141
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,350
确定他会来吗
You sure he's showing up?

142
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,270
这是他主要存货地点
This is his main drop.

143
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,010
你在费城的人这么说
Says your man in Philly.

144
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,080
他最清楚不过 不是吗
Well,he would know,wouldn't he?

145
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,190
他为何不去给史密斯通风报信
And what's stopping him from tipping Smith off?

146
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,220
为何要那样
Why would he do that?

147
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,440
因为他以前从没费心去抓史密斯
Because he's never bothered to catch him.

148
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,229
他来了告诉我
Call me when he gets here.

149

我会处理的 我保证
I'll take care of it. You've my word.

不需要把自己扯进来
You needn't involve yourself.

151
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,670
我是这么交代你的吗
Is that what I asked you?

152
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,010
你说过要低调行事
You've mentioned low profiles.

153
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:01,840
我只是服从
I'm trying to oblige.

154
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,510
去找找乐子吧
Go buy a personality.

155
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,250
让我把话说清
Let me get this straight.

156
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,970
罗塞蒂正加油 希寇斯靠着旁边的油泵
Rosetti's gassing up,Sickles is at the next pump.

突然想要抽支烟
decides that it's a good time for a smoke.

160
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,920
那有什么差别
Look,what's the difference?

161
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,440
他生前是你的搭档
The man was your partner.

162
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,880
我的意思是 那无关紧要
What I'm saying is,it don't matter.

163
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,520
一切都在掌控中
The situation's being handled.

你刚刚还说不能逮捕他们
You just said you couldn't arrest them.

167
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:53,810
我没有说要逮捕他们
I'm not talking about arresting them.

168
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,160
我说要处理他们
I'm talking about handling them.

169
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,840
我明晚有一批货过路 拉姆西警官
I got a load coming through here tomorrow night,Deputy Ramsey.

170

我现在是治安官了
I'm the sheriff now.

171
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,410
我还是有货要过路

Even your money reeks.

184

所以啤酒这么赚钱

00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,840
怎么回事 罗兰
What's the story,Rowland?

284
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,640
我也没想到
Beats me.

285
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,900
他们是费城的禁酒探员
They're Prohees out of Philly.

286
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,000
他们在跟踪我
They've kind of been following me.

287
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,810
你这小混蛋
Arsed-out little shit.

288
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,990
-我只是在说情况  -里面有你认识的吗
-Just trying to get a leg up. -You know any of them?

289
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,530
那个拿着散弹枪的高条子
That tall fed with the 12-gauge,

290
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,450
他是瓦克西 戈登手下的
he's in Waxey Gordon's pocket.

291
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,780
-还有呢  -他们肯定想来杀我
-Anything else? -Pretty sure they're here to kill me.

292
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,590
别胡扯了...
Enough with the bull...

293
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,580
天啊 不是我们...
Jeez,it's not our...

294
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,370
好了 上 快点了事
All right,let's go. Do what you have to do.

295
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,190
看好窗户 伙计们
Watch the windows,boys.

296
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,730
我去查地下室
I'm gonna check the cellar.

297
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,220
找到什么没
Anything?

298
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:24,360
蜘蛛网还有松鼠粪
Just cobwebs and squirrel turd.

299
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,420
松鼠粪
Squirrel turds?

300
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,370
那是老鼠屎
That's rat shit.

301
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,910
再来一杯
Hit me again.

302
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,470
我来帮多里奥先生拿东西
Picking up for Mr. Torrio.

303
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,040
来一小杯
Give me a short one.

304
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:06,250
是古兹克对吧 多里奥的人
Guzik,right? Torrio's man.

305
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,600
没错 我认识你吗
Yeah. I know you?

306
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,940
乔 米勒 我是迪恩尼 奥巴尼恩的人
Joe Miller. I'm with Deanie O'Banion.

307
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,380
好吧
Uh-huh. Okay.

308
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,920
-这儿啤酒更好 对吧  -怎么说
-Beer's better here,huh? -How's that?

309
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,460
南边的啤酒更好吧
I say the beer's better here down on the South Side?

310
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,380
我喝起来没差别
Tastes the same to me.

311
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,220
反正 不可相信水(美国谚语)
Well,can't trust the water anyway.

312
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,700
什么水
What water?

313
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:28,370
任何水 我不知道 我只是...
Any water. I don't know,I'm just...

314
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:32,140
你喝酒 我也喝
look,you drink,I'll drink.

315
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,470
我们好好相处
We're fine,right?

316
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,150
对 当然
Sure,we are.

317
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:44,080
你说迪恩 奥巴尼恩是骗子
You called Dean O'Banion a liar.

318
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,470
-什么  -那天在多里奥那
-Huh? -That day at Torrio's.

319
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:50,650
-我不是认真的...  -你体型大嘴也大
-I don't really... -You got a big mouth to match that big gut.

320
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,520
好好喝酒吧 乔
Enjoy your beer,Joe.

321
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,060
有你在这 一身臭气 我哪喝得下
How can I with the stink coming off of you?

322
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,020
不理我是吧 大块头
Walk away from me,Jumbo?

323
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,370
我在跟你说话 你这肥佬
I'm talking to you,you fat fuck.

324
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,470
来拿东西的吗
Came to collect?

325
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,330
来
Here.

326
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,650
再给你点
Have some more.

327
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,380
感觉怎么样
How you holding up,huh?

328
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,700
快 搬上去
Come on,get it on. Get it on.

329
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,340
抓紧 伙计们 时间很紧
Hurry it up,guys. We don't have all night.

330
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,300
真够慢的
Taking their sweet time.

331
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,460
等着吧
Wait it out.

332
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,460
如果他们又要下来查怎么办
And if they decide to look down here again?

333
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:04,930
我们是一根线上的蚂蚱了
Well,we're all in this together,ain't we?

334
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,900
童言无忌
The mouths of babes.

335
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,590
我们车上留了什么
What did we leave in the car?

336
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,530
没什么 我总是打理干净
Nothing. I always keep it clean.

337
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,520
-车牌呢  -在坦尼的名下
-The plates? -In Tunney's name.

338
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,270
估计他不会在乎了
Don't expect he'll much mind now.

339
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,970
如果你要的话 我有五十个
I got maybe 50 if you need any.

340
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:41,980
五十个什么
Got 50 what?

341
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,810
车牌 随时能换
License plates. Swap 'em around.

342
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,730
那样就没人能找到我们了
That way,they can't ever track us.

343
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,270
你就是这么干的是吧
That's your system,is it?

344
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,260
我自己想出来的
Worked it out myself.

345
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:57,190
那他们怎么还是找到你了
Then what are they doing out there?

346
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:01,460
凑巧吧 我猜
Just coincidence,I reckon.

347
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,810
还是挺厉害的 对吧
Pretty good run,though,huh?

348
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,220
真让人好奇
Kept us guessing.

349
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:13,040
其实也不难 如果你不介意我直说
Not that hard,really,if you don't mind me saying.

350
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,550
-怎么不难  -快点开车 放几枪
-Why's that? -Drive fast,flash the pistol.

351
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:20,780
谁愿意为了几箱酒丢了小命
I mean,who wants to get all killed over a few crates of booze?

352
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:24,380
没有人
No one.

353
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,870
我也是这么想的
That's how I see it,too.

354
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,490
不过奈特真惨
Shame about Nate,though.

355
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,040
他是我的搭档
He was my partner.

356
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:35,820
是吗 他怎么了
Oh,aye? What happened to him?

357
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,530
联邦探员抓到他了
Feds got him.

358
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,500
看来他没你这么走运
Guess he didn't have your luck.

359
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,430
有人搜过地下室吗
Anyone check the cellar?

360
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,230
汤普森先生
Mr. Thompson.

361
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,500
是的 我查过了
Yeah,I did.

362
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:56,920
那就再查查
Well,check it again.

363
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:13,300
纽约

364
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,910
你干什么
What the fuck are you doing?

365
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,890
照你说的做啊
Like you said.

366
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,810
只要一勺泻药 贝尼
One part laxative,Benny.

367
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,660
你想让他们拉满赫斯特大街吗
You want them shitting themselves all over Hester Street?

368
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,980
有什么发现吗
Anything?

369
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:28,060
我和查理有事要谈
Charlie and I need to talk.

370
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,750
是时候让我参与了
I think it's time I got included.

371
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,760
-凭什么  -我挺身而出
-Based on what? -I stepped up.

372
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:36,720
做了我该做的 也就是说我能留下来听
I did what I had to. That means I stay in the room.

373
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,540
你在大街上开了一顿乱枪
You shot your wad off in the middle of the street.

374
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,290
-我干掉了他们中的一个  -是迈耶干的
-They went back minus one. -Meyer did that.

375
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:44,400
-我掩护了他  -贝尼
-I fucking gave him cover! -Benny.

376
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,680
我们必然会商议此事
We are certainly gonna discuss this,

377
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,960
但不是现在 所以...
but not right now,so...

378
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:06,240
他召我去见他 今天中午
I'm summoned. At noon.

379

我和你一起去
I'll come with you.

380
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,080
迈耶 马塞里亚对你恨之入骨
Meyer,Masseria hates that shayna punim of yours.

381
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,920
尤其是现在
Now more than ever.

382
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,340
你要是去了 谁知道会发生什么事
You turn up,who knows where this goes?

383
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,830
他必须明白如今的趋势
He needs to understand the way the world's heading.

384
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,200
是你说要和解的
You're the one who said come to terms.

385
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,950
-那是以前  -你看
-That was before. -Well,you see?

386
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,240
这就是你的问题所在
This is the problem with you.

387
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,210
总是刚愎自用
Always very headstrong.

388
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,860
幸好有我在 能让你理智一点
Good thing I'm here to talk some sense.

389
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:42,120
给他百分之二 百分之五是底线
Offer two. Settle at five.

390

百老汇西部不动 格兰德南部不给

422
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,300
没事了
It's okay. Shh.

423
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,510
没事了 到我怀里来
It's okay. Come here. Come here.

424
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,020
好了 好了
Come on. Shh.

425
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,000
有爸爸呢
Papa's got you.

426
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:42,090
是的 是 是 好的 太太
Yes. Yeah,yeah. Yes,missus.

427
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,210
谢谢
Thank you.

428
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:47,400
汤普森太太也不知道
Mrs. Thompson has no information.

429
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:49,220
-彻奇那呢  -试过了
-Try over at Chalky's. -I did.

430
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,100
洛莉 斯坦曼也试了
Lolly Steinman as well.

431
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,520
还有纽约的那个姑娘
Chippy in New York,then.

432
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:58,130
肯特小姐也没见到他
Miss Kent has not seen him either.

433
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,010
这次罗斯坦的货有多少
How many for Rothstein?

434
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,870
八百箱 和上次一样
800. Same as last time.

435
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,560
我不会这么做的 米奇
I wouldn't do this,Mickey.

436
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,250
你当然不会这么做 因为你说了不算
Of course you wouldn't. 'Cause you're not in charge.

437
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,120
动动脑子吧
Use your head,will you?

438
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,090
备用路线不能用 也不能走塔博尔高地
There's no way through the back roads and Tabor Heights is off-limits.

439
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,650
有治安官呢 你自己也听到了
Sheriff's on it. You heard him yourself.

440
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,510
治安官才刚上任不到一周
The sheriff's been on the job less than a week.

441
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,100
而上一个被人活活烧死了
And the last one got burned...

442
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,430
你不需要去装车吗
Don't you have some trucks to load?

443
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,350
当然 老板
Sure thing,boss.

444
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,950
-什么 你听到什么了没  -没有
-What,you hear something? -No,I didn't hear anything.

445
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,600
也睡不着吗
Couldn't sleep either?

446
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,610
床不舒服
Not exactly a featherbed.

447
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:58,000
就算舒服也睡不好
Although that hasn't been helping either.

448
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,390
貌似对他没什么影响
Doesn't seem to bother him.

449
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:06,220
我都不知道什么对他有影响
I'm not sure what does.

450
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:11,300
曾度过了几个像这样的夜晚
More than a few nights spent like this

451
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,040
在阿尔斯特(爱尔兰北部)的时候
back in Ulster.

452
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,640
为什么
How's that?

453
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:17,240
你得到命令 这样那样的地址
You'd get your orders,this or that address,

454
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,500
然后静静等待 直到完成任务
and then count off the hours till you finish the business.

455
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,060
任务倒不难
Wasn't the work,though.

456
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,420
难的是等待
It was the waiting.

457
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,440
你一定找到打发时间的方法了吧
Must have had your way of getting through it.

458
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,200
是的
Oh,aye.

459
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:36,110
走在科尔雷恩大街上
Walk through the streets of Coleraine

460
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,570
脑中构想的
in my head.

461
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,590
去学校
Steps to the school.

462
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:44,250
去教堂 去蔬菜商店
Steps to the church. Steps to the greengrocer.

463
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,850
你一晚上就想这个了
That what you've been doing all night?

464
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:55,620
我已数月没想过了
I have not thought on the place in months.

465
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,970
听上去 好像你有在家的感觉
Sounds like you're feeling at home.

466
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,330
我知道谁说了算 汤普森先生
I know who's in charge,Mr. Thompson.

467
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,830
也许你对现状不太满意
Maybe you're not happy about it.

468
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,050
我满意与否不重要
It's not my satisfaction that matters.

469
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:18,780
我是怎么赢得你的忠诚的
And what have I done to earn your loyalty?

470
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,320
你给了我一个位置
You made a place for me.

471
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,330
不说奉承话
Now minus the soft soap.

472
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,510
你至少还给我工钱
You pay me.

473
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,100
天啊
Jesus.

474
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,620
发生了什么
What the fuck happened?

475
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,480
-乔 米勒  -谁
-Joe Miller. -Who?

476
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,200
奥巴尼恩的人
O'Banion's man.

477
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,230
昨晚我在收钱
Last night I was making my collection,

478
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,140
他偷袭我
he dry-gulched me.

479
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,390
他趁你不注意打你吗
What,he hit you when you wasn't looking?

480
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,280
我刚要离开凯勒的酒吧
I was leaving the bar at Keller's.

481
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,100
-他来南边了吗  -用啤酒杯揍的我
-He's on the South Side? -Cracked me with a beer mug.

482
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,800
把我脑袋砸开花了
Split my head open.

483
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,060
该死的爱尔兰混蛋
Irish fucking prick.

484
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,560
他还取笑我
Al,he made fun of me.

485
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,450
-什么  -我的意思是 他...
-What? -I mean,he...

486
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,140
在所有人面前
in front of everybody.

487
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,940
你觉得我自己不烦吗
You think it doesn't bother me?

488
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,710
我身上就是这个味
I can't help how I smell.

489
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:46,380
不管我怎么洗
Hour after I wash,

490
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,950
怎么换衣服
I already got to change my...

491
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,510
阿尔
Al?

492
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,680
女性健康诊所 圣特雷萨医院
Women's health clinic. St. Theresa's Hospital.

493
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,400
完全免费 女性健康诊所
Free to all. Women's health clinic.

494
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,740
圣特雷萨医院 完全免费
St. Theresa's Hospital. Free to all.

495
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,069
女士 看一下吗
Ma'am,may I give you one of these?

496
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,460
-是小姐  -什么
-Miss. -Pardon?

497
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,560
是小姐 这不是我的孩子
Miss. It's not my baby.

498
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:12,210
有没有孩子都可以来的
You're welcome in any case.

499
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:23,980
不好意思 我是圣特雷萨...
Excuse me,I'm from St. Theresa's Hospi...

500
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,800
席勒夫人 你好
Mrs. Shearer. Hello.

501
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,230
怎么了
Yes?

502
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,310
玛格丽特 汤普森 那天...
Margaret Thompson. We met...

503
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,430
我记得 你要干什么
I remember you. What do you want?

504
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,790
你可能有兴趣
Something that might interest you.

505
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:38,510
这是一系列课程...
It's a series of classes intended...

506
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,990
-我已经知道了  -是课程吗
-I know about it already. -The class?

507
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,350
你做的事我都知道
All of it.

508
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,190
我也觉得你肯定知道
I thought the same thing myself.

509
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,160
而我这么无知 我觉得很羞愧
And truthfully I'm ashamed by my ignorance.

510
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,070
那你凭什么给别人上课
Then who are you to lecture people about it?

511
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,510
不是我上课 是医院的医生
I'm not. We have a doctor from the hospital staff.

512
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,630
请尽量来吧
Please come if you can.

513
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:01,150
你的经历是很宝贵的...
Your own experience will be valuable for...

514
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,310
每个人都花了两美分吗
A two-cent piece for each of them?

515
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:06,370
一个月就这一次 这是谁
It's only once a month. Who's this?

516
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:07,990
医院里的一位女士
A lady from the hospital.

517
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,490
-席勒先生吗  -没错
-Is it Mr. Shearer? -Yes,ma'am.

518
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,820
跟我们的账单有关吧
This isn't about our bill,is it?

519
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,410
我知道我们还的不太及时 但我保证...
We got ourselves a little behind,but I promise...

520
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:14,650
不是的
No,not that at all.

521
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:18,230
我是想告诉您太太...
I just wanted to tell your wife that...

522
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,650
看到她恢复得这么好 我很开心
that I'm glad to see she's doing so much better.

523
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,470
我们一直在祈祷
Well,we've said our prayers,

524
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,250
看来上帝是听到了
but that's how the Lord must have wanted it.

525
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,670
是啊
Yes,of course.

526
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,810
他没让埃德温纳降临人世 减轻我们的负担
But He spared Edwina and we're blessed for that.

527
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,050
医生也帮了不少忙
The doctors had some hand in it.

528
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,440
我请了一个星期的假 就为了照顾她
I took the week off to see her through.

529
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:38,110
你是想偷个懒 抽你那个破雪茄
You just wanted to put your feet up and smoke those awful cigars.

530
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,550
等她完全康复了 我们再要一个
And when she's up to it,we'll try again.

531
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,950
当然也感谢你的好意
We do appreciate your good wishes,though.

532
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,690
我们还回不回去了
Are we gonna spend the whole day out here?

533
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,790
跟着妈妈走
Lead on,Mother.

534
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,440
准备好了吗 小伙子们
Ready,boys?

535
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:03,860
女性健康课程 圣特雷萨医院 完全免费
Women's health class. St. Theresa's Hospital. Free to all.

536
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,740
女性健康课程 圣特雷萨医院
Women's health class. St. Theresa's Hospital.

537
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,880
花花公子驾到

538
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,940
最近怎么样 乔

539
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,560
我能怎么样

540
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,160
事情都发展到这步田地了

541
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,200
请坐吧

542
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:30,010
上面还有你的名字呢(幸运之座)

543
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,470
听着像墓碑

544
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:40,200
不会的 今天不会发生这样的事

545
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:54,530
我来说说你们犹太人...

546
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,880
对犹太人而言 生意就是生意

547
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,720
而我们做生意投入感情

548
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:03,810
因为我们有宽阔的胸怀

549
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:07,650
这是我的地盘

550
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,900
我们都知道

551
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:15,010
赌场有你的分红 中间人和卖酒都有你的分红
You get a cut in card game,a cut of the fence,a cut of the booze.

552
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,390
海洛因的分红我没有

553
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,200
怎么分 那就是个副业
What's to give? It's a sideline.

554
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:23,550
你在我地盘上做买卖

555
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,210
然后坐享其成

556
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:31,460
多还是少 我不在乎

557
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:34,460
我们心胸宽广

558
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:38,570
那分你百分之二

559
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,640
我要你所有收入的百分之二

560
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,730
你地盘上的买卖分你百分之二

561
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,550
发生了那破事之后 就这么打发我吗

562
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,500
我们是在讲理

563
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,290
"我们" "我们"
"We." "We."

564
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,250
好好看看
Have a look around.

565
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,100
就咱们俩
There's just you and me.

566
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:02,829
我有合作伙伴
I have partners.

567
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:05,790
犹太人 信得过吗

568
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,560
你刚说过生意就是生意

569
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,610
因为犹太人没有心胸

570
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,200
你倒是没摊上事 是吗

571
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,450
下次可能就不是了

572
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:19,920
下次你就跑不了了是吗

573
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:22,280
我倒觉得挺好的

574
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:33,680
我很担心你 萨尔瓦多

575
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,810
我一直是老样子

576
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:47,760
以前那个经常来的小男孩

577
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,080
野心是有

578
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,380
但很懂得尊重人

579
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:00,280
但那个孩子哪去了

580
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,880
你身上根本没有他的影子了

581
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,330
百分之三

582
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,490
百分之三十

583
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,250
所有的吗

584
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,070
只有我地盘上的

585
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,050
我们相隔太远了 乔

586
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:26,390
其实根本不远 萨尔瓦多

587
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:30,680
只有两英尺

588
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:36,870
我回去商量一下

589
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:42,330
该做什么尽管去做

590
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,940
但要记住

591
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,910
罗斯坦 还有那个兰斯基

592
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:47,570
没有心胸

593
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,920
他们会在背后中伤你

594
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,220
因为他们不是你的家人

595
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:01,210
等你需要帮助的时候

596
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,910
百分之三十的钱

597
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,620
根本不够用
...gonna look very cheap.

598
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:14,260
多伊尔先生 我为什么在跟你谈话
Mr. Doyle. Why am I talking to you?

599
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,130
因为你给我打电话了
'Cause you called me.

600
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,190
那我为什么要给你打电话呢
But why am I calling you?

601
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,430
我怎么可能给你打电话呢
Why is that even occurring?

602
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:25,250
如果你老板如约把酒送过来
If I had my liquor on the timely basis your employer promised,

603
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,390
其实 我若能找到你那
if,in fact,I could reach your employer,

604
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,149
无视商业原则
who now seems to think acceptable business practice

605
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,690
无故消失数天的老板
to disappear for days on end,

606
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,900
我现在就用不着给你打电话了
this conversation would not be taking place.

607
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,890
这样我就会...
And that would make me...

608
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,289
很开心
very happy.

609
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:42,170
我知道
Yeah,I understand.

610
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:46,410
-罗斯坦先生  -我掏钱了 我要货
-Listen,Mr. Rothstein. -I want what I paid for.

611
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,750
-现在就要  -没问题 先生
-I want it now. -Okay,sir.

612
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,660
而且我再也不想跟你谈话了
And I don't ever want to find myself chatting with you again.

613
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:54,320
-当然  -听明白了吗
-Of course. -Is that clear?

614
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,890
明早就送到
You'll have it by tomorrow morning.

615
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,770
罗斯坦那家伙 笑面虎一个
That Rothstein,warm as a lizard.

616
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,660
他说什么了
What did he say?

617
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,250
他在等我们送货
That he's expecting his delivery.

618
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,460
你怎么说的
And what did you tell him?

619
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:14,080
你说呢 肯定说马上到
That it's coming. What do you think?

620
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:17,910
我说你是个白痴
What do I think? That you're a fucking idiot.

621
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,590
注意点 伊莱 我是你老板
Watch your step,Eli. I'm your boss.

622
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,900
纳吉特别提到要避开塔博尔高地
Nucky explicitly said to avoid Tabor Heights.

623
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,760
我听到了 但是不可能走备用路线
I heard. There's no way to use the back roads.

624
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,810
最早也要等到五月
Not till May at the earliest.

625
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:34,730
那就先别送货
So hold off making the delivery.

626
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:37,960
然后让你哥哥来找我的麻烦吗 不用了
And get your brother's foot up my ass? No,thanks.

627
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:41,260
我给你说 别这么干 米奇
I'm telling you not to do this,Mickey.

628
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:46,010
我什么也不做 是他们要做
I'm not doing nothing. They are.

629
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:59,010
你直接送货去纽约
You're straight through to New York.

630
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,920
在塔博尔高地加大油门 就这样
Gas up in Tabor Heights and that's it.

631
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:04,290
遇到任何情况都不要停车 就算是警察
You stop for nobody. Not even the law.

632
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,990
今晚是我的夜晚
Tonight is my night.

633
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:32,550
他有枪
He's got a gun.

634
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,120
好了 好了
Easy!

635
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,090
停手
Stop!

636
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,470
要找那些无力保护自己的人的麻烦吗
You want to pick on people who can't defend themselves?

637
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,050
是吗
Huh?

638
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,150
给他办葬礼的钱
Pay for his funeral.

639
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,250
他们说什么
What are they saying?

640
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,570
他们要收工走人了
I think they're wrapping it up.

641
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,000
他们走了
They're gone.

642
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:20,590
差点拉了裤子 是吧 孩子
Nearly shit your breeches there,didn't you,son?

643
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,480
该死的 我可不害怕
Heck,I wasn't scared.

644
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,440
我害怕
I was.

645
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:29,810
好吧 我也怕
Okay,I was,too.

646
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:34,470
我绝不偷看
There'll not be a peep from me.

647
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,820
他总是这么有意思吗
He always this much fun?

648
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,180
你该听听他是怎么打电话的
You should hear him on the phone sometime.

649
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,360
和他女朋友两情缱绻
...Canoodling with his girlfriend.

650
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,140
冰箱里有培根和鸡蛋
Well,I got bacon and eggs in the icebox.

651
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:49,810
饿的话 我可以给你们炸一下
I can fry 'em up if anyone's hungry.

652
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:57,620
也许他们在楼上还留下点酒
Maybe they left a bottle upstairs.

653
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:54,720
我们来了
Here we are.

654
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,070
来
Come on.

655
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:58,940
伙计们 准备好赚点钱了吗
Hey,fellas. Ready to make some dough?

656
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,820
吉普点头之前别行动
Don't make a move until Gyp says so.

657
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:09,260
你们来帮我们封锁道路
You're gonna help us block the road.

658
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:11,180
开第一枪 然后行动
First shot,then you move.

659
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,890
一定要保证道路封锁
Just keep the road blocked.

660
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:18,670
-别害怕  -躲起来
-Don't be yellow now. -Down in the shadows.

661
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:24,500
罗斯坦的货在路上
Rothstein's shipment is on its way.

662
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,040
哪条路
By which route?

663
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:30,550
塔博尔高地
Tabor Heights.

664
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,440
有消息说这套路是安全的
Word came back it's clear.

665
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:36,890
没人想知道这二十四小时我们在哪
Did anyone wonder where we were for the last 24 hours?

666
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:39,410
就算有 他们也没声张
If they did,they were quiet about it.

667
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:48,730
那么
Well?

668
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,160
你看到了吗
You see this?

669
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,650
看什么 这里什么都没有
See what? There's nothing here.

670
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:03,810
那就对了 你我都一无所有了
That's my point. We've both got empty hands.

671
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:05,580
这告诉你什么
What's that say to you?

672
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:09,280
找个更好的藏身处吗
Find a better hideout?

673
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:13,010
汤普森先生
Mr. Thompson,

674
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,680
你必须得承认我很擅长这个
you got to admit I'm pretty good at this.

675
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:19,240
我可不会到处吹嘘
I wouldn't go boasting about it.

676
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,550
是的 我会说我再也不会这么做了
Yeah,and I could say I'd never do it again,

677
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,750
但你不会相信我的 对吧
but you wouldn't believe me,would you?

678
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,400
很可能不会
Probably not.

679
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,710
那么
So...

680
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,380
我为你工作怎么样
so how's about I come work for you?

681
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:35,540
说来听听 罗兰
How would that go,Rowland?

682
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:37,520
就...
Well...

683
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:42,360
让我开车 给我发支枪
put me behind the wheel,box of shotgun shells,

684
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:44,810
看他们还敢不敢再偷了
just let them try stealing then.

685
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,130
他不喜欢我
He doesn't like me.

686
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:50,960
你能怨他吗
Can you blame him?

687
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:55,130
我在紧要关头不淡定吗
Ain't I cool in a tight spot?

688
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:00,070
你行
You'll do.

689
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:01,880
我了解这附近的路
I know all the roads around here.

690
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,560
潜伏的好地方
Best places to lie low.

691
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:05,780
藏东西的好地方
Best places to keep your stash.

692
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:08,610
他们抓不到我
They won't ever catch me.

693
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,360
我们抓到你了 罗兰
We caught you,Rowland.

694
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,620
是的 但没那么容易
Okay,but it wasn't easy.

695
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:18,070
瓦克西 戈登 远远没有你那么聪明
And Waxey Gordon,he ain't nearly as smart as you.

696
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:20,320
他的酒 你想拿多少就拿多少
You could take as much of his booze as you'd like.

697
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:22,130
轻而易举
It's apples off a tree.

698
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:27,120
告诉我你想怎么做
Just tell me what you want to do.

699
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:29,390
你小子很有勇气
You've sure got a lot of moxie.

700
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:33,070
要不然还有什么办法成功
How else are you supposed to get ahead?

701
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:37,660
我以为你不抽烟
I thought you didn't smoke.

702
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:40,730
我说过吗
Did I say that?

703
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:45,860
-你到底多大了  -十九
-How old are you really? -19.

704
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:49,940
所以法律上说 我可以开车 这不是更好吗
So legally I'm allowed to drive. Isn't that better?

705
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:56,350
抽我的
Have one of mine.

706
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:20,830
-凯斯勒先生  -谁是凯斯勒先生
-Mr. Kessler. -Who's Mr. Kessler?

707
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,410
他是汤普森先生的司机
He's Mr. Thompson's driver.

708
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:41,160
我以为你会放了他
