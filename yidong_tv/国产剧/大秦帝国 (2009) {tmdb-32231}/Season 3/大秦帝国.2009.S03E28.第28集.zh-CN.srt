What are you doing up? 
It's 3:30.

3
00:00:51,945 --> 00:00:56,501
It's the seventh night this week
I've sat 'til morning. 
Great. Here we go.

00:00:56,611 --> 00:01:01,391
Imagining the ways
You might have died. 
Ah, yes, and tonight's winner is...

5
00:01:01,497 --> 00:01:06,039
In a freak September 
Ice storm without warning... 
Because that happens.

6
00:01:06,142 --> 00:01:11,633
There's a gang war;
There's a bird flu; trains collide. 
What did we say about
Watching the news?

7
00:01:11,727 --> 00:01:16,259
Now you act all sweet and surly 
But you swore you'd come home early, 

8
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,350
And you lied. 
You've got to let go, Mom.
I'm almost eighteen.

9
00:01:20,438 --> 00:01:23,229
Are you snorting coke? 
Not at the moment.

10
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:27,263
Who's up at this hour? 
Your father. Go. Up the back way.

11
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:29,950
Why does he hate me? 
Because you're a little twat.

12
00:01:30,037 --> 00:01:35,081
You can't call me a twat. 
Everything okay? 

13
00:01:35,168 --> 00:01:39,211
I heard voices.
Just me talking to myself, you know. 

14
00:01:39,306 --> 00:01:43,901
Now you head on upstairs.
I'll be up for sex in a minute. 

15
00:01:44,961 --> 00:01:49,495
Uh, are you sure you're okay?
Go.

They're the perfect loving family, 
So adoring

18
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,747
And I love them everyday 
Of every week

19
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:05,093
So my son's a little shit, 
My husband's boring

20
00:02:05,215 --> 00:02:09,319
And my daughter, though a genius, 
Is a freak

21
00:02:09,406 --> 00:02:14,223
Still I help them love each other

Is everything okay?
Everything's great.

Why wouldn't it be great? 
It's great.

A physics problem, that history quiz,

"Flowers for Algernon", which is,

Like... duh... everything's so under control. 
It's just, like, calm.

Honey, you need to slow down. 
Take some time for yourself. 

29
00:02:47,296 --> 00:02:53,871
I'm going to have sex with your father.
Great. Thanks. I'm so glad I know that.

30
00:02:54,798 --> 00:02:59,083
So it's times like these 
I wonder how I take it

31
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:02,882
And if other families live 
The way we do

32
00:03:02,971 --> 00:03:07,230
If they love each other 
Or if they just fake it

33
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:11,287
And if other daughters 
Feel like I feel, too

34
00:03:11,372 --> 00:03:14,006
'Cause some days 
I think I'm dying

35
00:03:14,108 --> 00:03:18,704
But I'm really only trying 
To get through

36
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:25,382
For just another day
For another stolen hour

37
00:03:25,464 --> 00:03:30,144
When the world will feel 
My power and obey

38
00:03:30,227 --> 00:03:32,912
It's just another day
It's just another day

39

Feeling like this feeling never goes away

That was great, wasn't it? 
That was great. Christ, I'm late.

42
00:03:46,962 --> 00:03:52,572
Well, that'll teach you to take a whole ten minutes.
Sorry, what?

43
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:58,809
I said, isn't it a beautiful day?
Okay, sure. I mean, it's cloudy and rainy 

44
00:03:58,897 --> 00:04:04,367
And really cold for September, but... beautiful.
Makes you wanna dive in with both feet, doesn't it?

45
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,845
Absolutely. 
I never know what she's talking about.

To hold your house together

00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:16,689
A house you built 
With patience and with care

48
00:04:16,777 --> 00:04:21,131
But you're grappling 
With that gray and rainy weather

49
00:04:21,213 --> 00:04:25,669
And you're living on a latte and a prayer
Prayer

You want to wipe your worried pain away

All spinning.

And you have a huge day.

We'll put it on the calendar!

On April of last year.

Eww.

I'm slammed at work

And we're out of everything.
I keep cave clean,

You go out get fire.
Absolutely. Again, no clue.

It only hurts when I breathe
It only hurts when I try

It only hurts when I think
It only hurts when I cry

It only hurts when I work
It only hurts when I play

It only hurts when I move
It only hurts when I say

A busy, busy day

You were running far away.

Birds are singing, things are growing

And I will pray to hold on just this way
And you wish that you'd be going

And you know that for forever
Every day is just another

Nothing to worry about.

You play 'til the strings

Or your fingernails break
So you'll rock that recital

Right. Seven minutes.

146
00:11:29,668 --> 00:11:36,493
But now I believe I would settle
For one who can drive

147
00:11:36,581 --> 00:11:40,797
The round blue ones with food 
But not with the oblong white ones. 

148
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:44,690
The white ones with the round yellow ones 
But not the trapezoidal green ones. 

149
00:11:44,776 --> 00:11:47,381
Split the green ones into thirds 
With a tiny chisel...

150
00:11:47,465 --> 00:11:55,263
My psychopharmacologist and I
It's like an odd romance

151
00:11:55,352 --> 00:12:01,833
Intense and very intimate
We do our dance

152
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:10,296
My psychopharmacologist and I
Call it a lover's game

153
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:17,439
He knows my deepest secrets
I know his name

154
00:12:18,308 --> 00:12:25,644
And though he'll never hold me
He'll always take my calls

155
00:12:25,742 --> 00:12:29,799
It's truly like 
He told me

156
00:12:29,903 --> 00:12:33,864
Without a little lift
The ballerina falls

157
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:39,105
Goodman, Diana. 
Bipolar depressive with delusional episodes. 

158
00:12:39,204 --> 00:12:43,067
Sixteen year history of medication, 
Adjustment after one week.

159
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:47,316
I've got less anxiety, 
But I have headaches, blurry vision, 

160
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,731
And I can't feel my toes.
So, we'll try again 

161
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:55,046
And eventually we'll get it right.
Not a very exact science, is it?

162
00:12:56,866 --> 00:13:04,210
Zoloft and Paxil and Buspar and Xanax, 
Depacon, Chronaphin, Ambien, Prozac

163
00:13:04,295 --> 00:13:12,041
Ativan calms me when I see the bills
These are a few of my favorite pills

164
00:13:15,547 --> 00:13:18,398
Oh! Thank you, doctor. 
Valium is my favorite color. 

165
00:13:18,492 --> 00:13:23,048
How'd you know?

166
00:13:23,158 --> 00:13:26,882
It's just that, the thing with jazz... 
How do you know you got it right. 

167
00:13:26,971 --> 00:13:31,228
It's just making shit up.
Which is also known as the act of creation.

168
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:34,740
Oh, you're one of those 
Pretentious stoner types.

169
00:13:34,854 --> 00:13:37,787
That's totally unfair.
I'm not pretentious. 

170
00:13:37,914 --> 00:13:45,073
I'm definitely not classical. 
It's so rigid and structured. 

171
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,131
There's no room for improvisation. 
You have to play the notes on the page

172
00:13:49,257 --> 00:13:53,445
Yeah, and what did Mozart know anyway? 
He should've just smoked a bowl 

173
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:57,958
And jammed on "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star."
Yeah, let's do that! 

174
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:02,160
Goodman, Diana: 
Second adjustment after three weeks. 

175
00:14:02,262 --> 00:14:05,448
Delusions less frequent, 
But depressive state worse.

176
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:09,818
I'm nauseous and I'm constipated; 
I've completely lost my appetite 

177
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,862
And gained six pounds, 
Which, you know, is just not fair.

178
00:14:17,795 --> 00:14:21,573
May cause the following side effects, 
One or more -

179
00:14:21,656 --> 00:14:24,852
Dizziness, drowsiness,
Sexual dysfunction,

180
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:28,404
Headaches and tremors, nightmares and seizures,
Constipation, nervous laughter, palpitations,

181
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:31,770
Anxiousness, anger,
Exhaustion, insomnia, irritability,

182
00:14:31,856 --> 00:14:34,595
Nausea, vomiting
Odd and alarming sexual feelings

183
00:14:34,683 --> 00:14:38,468
Oh, and one last thing -
Use may be fatal. 

184
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,891
Use may be fatal. 
Use may be fatal.

185
00:14:40,971 --> 00:14:43,724
Goodman, Diana: 
Third adjustment after five weeks. 

186
00:14:43,808 --> 00:14:47,642
Reports continue: mild anxiety 
And some lingering depression.

187
00:14:47,727 --> 00:14:53,930
I now can't feel my fingers or my toes. 
I sweat profusely for no reason.

188
00:14:54,036 --> 00:14:59,206
I have wasted, like, weeks of practice 
With you here improvising.

189
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:02,998
Oscar Peterson was classically trained.
Beethoven did cocaine.

190
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:06,953
Miles Davis went to Juilliard.
Mozart wrote poems about farts.

191
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:12,139
Fortunately, I have absolutely 
No desire for sex. 

192
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,717
Although, whether that's the medicine 
Or the marriage is anybody's guess.

193
00:15:16,818 --> 00:15:20,442
I'm sure it's the medicine.
Oh, thank you. 

194
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:25,623
That's very sweet, 
But my husband's waiting in the car.

195
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:29,894
Who's crazy,
The one who's half gone

196
00:15:30,023 --> 00:15:33,719
Or maybe 
The one who holds on

197
00:15:33,806 --> 00:15:40,115
Remembering when she was twenty
And brilliant and bold

198
00:15:40,912 --> 00:15:48,448
And I was so young and so dumb
And now I am old

199
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:52,483
And she was wicked and wired 
And though he'll never hold me

200
00:15:52,565 --> 00:15:56,427
The sex was simply inspired 
He'll always take my calls

201
00:15:56,534 --> 00:15:59,155
Now there's no sex, she's depressed 
It's truly like he told me

202
00:15:59,245 --> 00:16:04,116
And me, I'm just tired, tired, tired, tired 
Without a little lift the ballerina falls

203
00:16:04,203 --> 00:16:06,117
Who's crazy 
My psychopharmacologist

204
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:07,859
The one who's uncured
and I...

205
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:11,115
Or maybe the one who's implored 
He's at every sight I lie

206
00:16:11,217 --> 00:16:13,525
The one who has treatment, 
Without you I'd die

207
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:18,015
Or the one who just deals with the pain
My psychopharmacologist and I...

208
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:26,550
They say love is blind...
But believe me, love is insane.

209
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:33,915
Goodman, Diana: Seven weeks.
I don't feel like myself.

210
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:44,892
I mean, I don't feel anything.
Hmm. Patient stable.

211
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:04,006
Your mom is, 
Like, in the next room.

212
00:17:04,097 --> 00:17:09,760
She's in denial. 
It's totally convenient.

213
00:17:09,866 --> 00:17:13,641
Dude, it's therapeutic!
Right. 

214
00:17:13,728 --> 00:17:21,870
It's medical marijuana to treat your ADD.
Totally. Huh?

215
00:17:21,956 --> 00:17:26,387
I don't put anything into my mouth 
That's on fire.

216
00:17:26,472 --> 00:17:31,877
I guess that's a good rule. 
Look, I can't do this! 

217
00:17:31,992 --> 00:17:37,530
Not with my life. 
I'm, like, one fuck-up from disaster.

218
00:17:37,631 --> 00:17:42,556
Your life is not a disaster. 
The environment is a disaster. 

219
00:17:42,634 --> 00:17:47,716
Sprint is a disaster.
You're stoned.

[ 4. Perfect for You ]

221
00:17:48,966 --> 00:17:52,850
Our planet is poisoned
The oceans, the air

222
00:17:52,953 --> 00:17:55,987
Around and beneath 
And above you

223
00:17:56,091 --> 00:18:00,389
Umm, Henry, that's true
And I totally care

224
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,134
I'm trying to tell you I love you
What?!

225
00:18:04,244 --> 00:18:07,967
The world is at war
Filled with death and disease

226
00:18:08,073 --> 00:18:11,383
We dance on the edge 
Of destruction

227
00:18:11,509 --> 00:18:15,633
The globe's getting warmer 
By deadly degrees

228
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,354
And this is one 
Fucked up seduction

229
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:25,029
This planet is pretty much broken 
Beyond all repair

But one thing is working 
If you're standing there

Perfect for you, 
I could be perfect for you

232
00:18:40,581 --> 00:18:48,239
I might be lazy, a loner, 
A bit of a stoner - it's true

233
00:18:48,348 --> 00:18:55,158
But I might be perfect for you, 
I'll make myself perfect, perfect for

You square all the corners, 
I straighten the curves

You've got some nerve, Henry
And I'm just all nerve

But even if everything else 
Turns to dirt

237

We'll be the one thing 
In this world that won't hurt

238
00:19:14,678 --> 00:19:23,742
I can't fix what's fucked up
But one thing I know I can do

239
00:19:24,949 --> 00:19:33,418
I can be perfect for you
I can be perfect for you

Nice house. 
Can I come in?

Oh, no.
Okay.

Are you spying on your own daughter?
When did she get a boyfriend? 

244
00:19:56,068 --> 00:20:00,199
How did I miss this?
Well, you kind of miss a lot.

245
00:20:01,411 --> 00:20:06,441
Do you think they're in love?
Who knows? They're young.

They're horny. 
It happens.

Marry me!
What?

248
00:20:14,752 --> 00:20:17,140
Marry me. 
Let's have a family. 

249
00:20:17,226 --> 00:20:18,345
I know we're too young, 
But we're not. 

250
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,734
I'm almost 22, 
And how do you know 

251
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:22,742
This isn't a sign
Saying we belong together?

252
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,905
How do you know it's not a sign 
Saying "get new rubbers"?

253
00:20:26,991 --> 00:20:32,885
Because I know it's not. 
I love you... and this baby!

[ 5. I Miss the Mountains ]

256
00:20:57,397 --> 00:21:08,719
There was a time when I flew higher
Was a time the wild girl running free

257
00:21:09,725 --> 00:21:18,372
Would be me
Now I see her feel the fire

258
00:21:18,729 --> 00:21:29,663
Now I know she needs me there to share
I'm nowhere

259
00:21:30,844 --> 00:21:41,801
All these blank and tranquil years
Seems they've dried up all my tears

260
00:21:42,626 --> 00:21:59,992
And while she runs free and fast
Seems my wild days are past

261
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:13,222
But I miss the mountains
I miss the dizzy heights

262
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:20,587
All the manic, magic days
And the dark, depressing nights

I miss the mountains
I miss the highs and lows

264
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:40,734
All the climbing, all the falling
All the while the wild wind blows

00:22:40,856 --> 00:22:48,492
Stinging you with snow
And soaking you with rain

Wandering through the wilderness

And spending all my time
Where the air is clear

Rewired the computer 
And did some decoupage. 

294

Okay, bye-bye.

I didn't know you had a brother.

Love, I know you know
Do you feel he's still real?

Love, it's just not so
Why is it you still believe?

332
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:15,389
Do you dream or do you grieve?
You've got to let him go

He's been dead all these years
No, my love, he's not here.

Do you know? Really? 
What exactly do you know?

343
00:29:15,361 --> 00:29:17,015
I know that you're hurting. 
I'm hurting, too.

344
00:29:17,115 --> 00:29:21,048
Do you wake up in the morning
And need help to lift your head?

345
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:25,619
Do you read obituaries
And feel jealous of the dead?

346
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:30,461
It's like living on a cliff-side
Not knowing when you'll dive

347
00:29:30,548 --> 00:29:34,984
Do you know, do you know
What it's like to die alive?

348
00:29:35,076 --> 00:29:39,707
When a world that once had color
Fades to white and grey and black

349
00:29:39,793 --> 00:29:44,646
When tomorrow terrifies you
But you'll die if you look back

You don't know
I know you don't know

You say that you're hurting
It sure doesn't show

352
00:29:53,889 --> 00:29:59,143
You don't know
It lays me so low

353
00:29:59,237 --> 00:30:05,212
When you say "let go"
And I say "you don't know"

354
00:30:07,827 --> 00:30:12,841
The sensation that you're screaming
But you never make a sound

355
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:17,300
Or the feeling that you're falling
But you never hit the ground

356
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:22,207
It just keeps on rushing at you
Day by day by day by day

You don't know, you don't know
What it's like to live that way

358
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,635
Like a refugee, a fugitive
Forever on the run

359

If it gets me it will kill me
But I don't know what I've done

00:30:36,695 --> 00:30:43,732
Can you tell me
What it is you're afraid of?

361
00:30:45,164 --> 00:30:50,033
Can you tell me 
Why I'm afraid it's me?

Can I touch you?
We've been fine for so long now

That I can't see?

Hey Dad, it's me

Could you let me go under?
Why can't you see?

372

Will you watch as I drown and wonder why? 
And wonder why

Are you bleeding?
Are you waiting?

Are you bruised? 
Are you broken?

Are you hurting?
Are you healing?

Are you hoping for a life to live?
Does it help you to know

00:36:21,049 --> 00:36:24,482
Son of steel and daughter of air
Son of steel and daughter of air

434
00:36:24,568 --> 00:36:27,379
He's a hero, a lover, a prince
He's a hero, a lover, a prince

435
00:36:27,467 --> 00:36:30,642
She's not there
She's not there

436
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:33,899
She's not there
She's not there

437
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:37,123
She's not there
She's not there

438
00:36:37,205 --> 00:36:41,710
She's not there
She's not there

439
00:36:53,534 --> 00:36:55,936
Let's not get discouraged. 
We'll find you a doctor 

440
00:36:56,025 --> 00:36:59,048
Who'll treat you without the drugs. 
There's someone out there for you. 

441
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:02,505
In the depression chat rooms, 
They say it's like dating. 

442
00:37:02,591 --> 00:37:05,137
You have to keep going 
Until you find the right match.

443
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:11,918
They have depression chat rooms?
And this doctor's supposed to be fantastic - 

444
00:37:12,008 --> 00:37:15,207
A real rock star. 
Three different women at work 

445
00:37:15,298 --> 00:37:20,786
Gave me his name.
Three women at work know I'm nuts?

446
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:24,860
Uh. 
Ah!

447
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:35,350
Diana, this way, please.
YEAH!

448
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:49,617
What did you just say?
I said "welcome."

449
00:37:49,746 --> 00:37:53,747
Have a seat. 
It's nice to meet you.

450
00:37:53,882 --> 00:38:11,384
Let's get it on now, baby!
Excuse me, what?

451
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:16,782
I said, "Let's get started."
Are you nervous, Diana?

452
00:38:16,911 --> 00:38:22,976
I am a little. 
A bit out of breath. 

453
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:31,496
Tingly, actually. 
Now you go.

454
00:38:31,591 --> 00:38:35,442
Well, let's start by getting to 
Know each other a bit. 

455
00:38:35,528 --> 00:38:39,443
Psychotherapy and medication 
Work best in tandem, 

456
00:38:39,552 --> 00:38:42,242
But we can try the first along 
And see how far we get. 

457
00:38:42,373 --> 00:38:47,271
Why don't you tell me...
Baby, what's your history?

458
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:52,407
Where'd you go 
And who'd you see? Yeah!

459
00:38:57,916 --> 00:39:08,883
My history? Well...
Um... I was diagnosed bi-polar... 

460
00:39:09,017 --> 00:39:16,688
Wow... sixteen years ago. 
Only, it turned out "bi-polar" 

461
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:20,833
Didn't totally cover it.
Well, often the best that we can do 

462
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,530
Is put names on collections of symptoms. 
It's possible bi-polar 

463
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:27,595
Has more in common 
With schizophrenia than depression.

464
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,355
When I was young, 
My mother called me "high-spirited". 

465
00:39:31,442 --> 00:39:34,848
She would know. 
She was so "high-spirited" 

466
00:39:34,944 --> 00:39:38,350
They banned her from the PTA.
Well, sometimes there's 

467
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:42,730
A pre-disposition to illness, 
But actual onset is only triggered 

468
00:39:42,861 --> 00:39:48,142
By some traumatic event.
I never know what to say 

469
00:39:48,229 --> 00:39:53,328
When I have to go over all of this. 
It starts to sound like some story 

470
00:39:53,413 --> 00:39:58,396
I tell about some other person entirely.
Why don't you tell me about 

471
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,958
The last time that you truly felt happy.
Oh.

472
00:40:04,092 --> 00:40:07,912
Were you happy when you got married?
I thought I was.

473
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:12,425
There's a difference between being happy 
And just thinking you're happy?

474
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:17,722
Most people who think they're happy 
Just haven't thought about it enough. 

475
00:40:22,912 --> 00:40:27,251
Most people who think 
They're happy are actually just stupid.

476
00:40:30,057 --> 00:40:33,941
I see. 
Were you happy 

477
00:40:34,027 --> 00:40:38,207
When your son was born?
My son?

478
00:40:38,956 --> 00:40:40,044
[ 10. I'm Alive. ]

479
00:40:40,693 --> 00:40:45,284
Tell me about him.
About my son?

480
00:40:47,594 --> 00:40:53,092
Why is he still around? 
Who is he? What is he?

481
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:57,230
I am what you want me to be
And I'm your worst fear, 

482
00:40:57,313 --> 00:41:03,275
You'll find it in me
Come closer, come closer

483
00:41:03,401 --> 00:41:07,579
Where does he come from even?
I am more than memory, 

484
00:41:07,664 --> 00:41:10,787
I am what might be
I am mystery

485
00:41:10,873 --> 00:41:16,705
You know me
So show me

486
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:22,585
When I appear 
It's not so clear

487
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:28,398
If I'm a simple spirit 
Or I'm flesh and blood

488
00:41:28,995 --> 00:41:32,153
But I'm alive, I'm alive, 
I am so alive

489
00:41:32,243 --> 00:41:34,952
And I feed on the fear
That's behind your eyes

490
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,903
And I need you to need me, 
It's no surprise

491
00:41:37,989 --> 00:41:45,246
I'm alive, so alive
I'm alive

492
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:48,487
Four times a week? 
That's a lot, isn't it?

493
00:41:48,573 --> 00:41:52,833
That's what the doctor recommended.
This is never going to get better, is it? 

494
00:41:52,961 --> 00:41:56,665
He's never going away.
I don't know, Natalie.

495
00:41:56,790 --> 00:42:00,033
This is one of those moments 
When you could just be a typical parent 

496
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:02,626
And lie and say "yes".
Yes.

497
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:04,593
Thanks. 
That's comforting. 

498
00:42:07,201 --> 00:42:13,344
I am flame and I am fire
I am destruction, decay, and desire

499
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:15,651
I'll hurt you
You know, Natalie, 

500
00:42:15,781 --> 00:42:18,665
I'll heal you
It's not all about your comfort.

501
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:24,662
I'm your wish, your dream come true
And I am your darkest nightmare too

502
00:42:24,748 --> 00:42:27,558
I've shown you
It's about helping your mother.

503
00:42:27,646 --> 00:42:30,773
I own you
As always!

504
00:42:30,857 --> 00:42:36,650
And though you made me, 
You can't change me

505
00:42:36,737 --> 00:42:41,965
I'm the perfect stranger 
Who knows you too well

506
00:42:42,055 --> 00:42:45,245
And I'm alive, I'm alive
I am so alive

507
00:42:45,331 --> 00:42:48,198
And I'll tell you the truth
If you let me try

508
00:42:48,283 --> 00:42:51,152
You're alive, I'm alive,
And I'll show you why

509
00:42:51,243 --> 00:42:58,766
I'm alive, so alive
I'm alive

510
00:43:02,966 --> 00:43:13,942
Xanex.
What the hell!

511
00:43:14,026 --> 00:43:21,163
I'm alive
I'm right behind you

512
00:43:21,244 --> 00:43:26,198
You say forget
But I'll remind you

513
00:43:26,285 --> 00:43:32,498
You can try to hide 
But you know that I will find you

514
00:43:32,583 --> 00:43:40,971
'Cause if you won't grieve me,
You won't leave me behind

515
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:45,453
Oh, oh, oh
You say he's eighteen now.

516
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:49,517
Isn't that when kids move out?
Isn't it time to let him go?

517
00:43:49,598 --> 00:43:51,825
No, no, no
I'm alive, I'm alive,

518
00:43:51,912 --> 00:43:54,567
I am so alive
If you climb on my back 

519
00:43:54,658 --> 00:43:57,929
Then we both can fly
If you try to deny me, 

520
00:43:58,021 --> 00:44:04,327
I'll never die
I'm alive, so alive

521
00:44:04,413 --> 00:44:09,698
I'm alive
Yeah, yeah

522
00:44:09,785 --> 00:44:16,167
I'm alive
I'm alive

523
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:23,573
I'm alive
I'm alive

524
00:44:35,836 --> 00:44:41,347
It's been four weeks, 
And I'd like to try something new today. 

525
00:44:41,435 --> 00:44:47,464
Sometimes when these stories are hard to tell,
Hypnosis can be helpful.

526
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,500
[ 11. Make Up Your Mind/Catch Me I'm Falling. ]

527
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,936
Oh, I don't think I could be hypnotized. 
I mean, it's fine. 

528
00:44:55,038 --> 00:45:00,949
It's just... I'm not the type.
Put your feet on the floor. 

529
00:45:01,062 --> 00:45:12,777
Put your hands in your lap... 
And breathe.

530
00:45:14,274 --> 00:45:17,927
Walk with me
Walk with me

531
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:22,680
Go all the way down
Down a long flight of stairs

532
00:45:22,768 --> 00:45:25,114
Stairs.
Go step by step into 

533
00:45:25,205 --> 00:45:29,562
The darkness down there
Should we turn on a light?

534
00:45:29,656 --> 00:45:34,573
You know, with the stairs?
Walk with me

535
00:45:34,667 --> 00:45:39,616
Down a hall
A hall that you know

536
00:45:39,713 --> 00:45:43,168
At the end there's a door
It's a door that 

537
00:45:43,266 --> 00:45:51,209
You've never laid eyes on before
Open the door

538
00:45:51,361 --> 00:46:02,053
Open the door
Can you hear me, Diana?

539
00:46:02,981 --> 00:46:09,717
Yes.
Are you nervous?

540
00:46:11,125 --> 00:46:17,760
No.
Good. Now...

541
00:46:18,221 --> 00:46:22,200
Make up your mind 
To explore yourself

542
00:46:22,304 --> 00:46:25,953
Make up your mind,
You have stories to tell

543
00:46:26,043 --> 00:46:29,923
We'll search in your past
For what sorrows may last

544
00:46:30,019 --> 00:46:33,596
Then make up your mind 
To be well

545
00:46:34,803 --> 00:46:37,013
Di, you come home
From these sessions in tears. 

546
00:46:37,106 --> 00:46:47,168
Is this helping or... Di? Di?
We were both undergrads - architecture.

547
00:46:48,621 --> 00:46:51,976
The baby wasn't planned,
Neither was the marriage. 

548
00:46:52,072 --> 00:46:57,525
I had always expected to be too busy,
But when the baby came,

549
00:46:57,656 --> 00:47:04,675
It all seemed to make sense until... until...
Until?

He's not here

Love, I know
You know

552
00:47:14,281 --> 00:47:17,223
Make up your mind 
That you're strong enough

553
00:47:17,314 --> 00:47:21,639
Make up your mind,
Let the truth be revealed

554
00:47:21,731 --> 00:47:25,447
Admit what you've lost
And live with the cost

555
00:47:25,544 --> 00:47:28,921
At times it does hurt
To be healed

556
00:47:29,015 --> 00:47:31,400
Catch me, I'm falling
In our first session,

557
00:47:31,491 --> 00:47:33,624
You told me...
Catch me, I'm falling

... that talking through your history... 
Faster than anyone should

Catch me, I'm falling
Catch me, I'm falling

560
00:47:39,967 --> 00:47:41,739
... feels like it's about someone else.

561
00:47:41,828 --> 00:47:43,473
Please hear me calling
Please hear me calling

562
00:47:43,614 --> 00:47:44,750
Make it about you.

563
00:47:44,838 --> 00:47:49,209
Catch me, I'm falling for good
Catch me, I'm falling for good

564
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:54,109
Hey, I'm not supposed to be backstage, 
But ... for luck.

565
00:47:54,203 --> 00:47:56,808
Did you see my parents out there?
Um, are you okay?

566
00:47:56,944 --> 00:48:01,066
I'm fine. 
My dad said they'd both be here.

567
00:48:01,159 --> 00:48:04,659
Then I'm sure they will be.
Will they?

568
00:48:04,786 --> 00:48:12,722
We had Natalie to... 
And I know she knows. 

569
00:48:13,847 --> 00:48:18,025
I couldn't hold her in the hospital.
Where the hell are they?

570
00:48:18,118 --> 00:48:21,696
I couldn't let myself hold her.
That's the first time

571
00:48:21,789 --> 00:48:24,043
You've mentioned Natalie
In weeks of therapy.

572
00:48:24,174 --> 00:48:28,765
Goddammit!
She's not there!

573
00:48:28,898 --> 00:48:34,398
She's not there!
She's not there!

574
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:38,449
Make up your mind,
You want clarity

575
00:48:38,535 --> 00:48:42,531
Take what you know 
And then make it make sense

576
00:48:42,667 --> 00:48:46,477
Just face what you fear
And soon it comes clear

577
00:48:46,572 --> 00:48:49,684
The visions are
Just your defense

578
00:48:49,776 --> 00:48:55,145
Umm, thank you for coming.
Natalie Goodman.

579
00:49:02,936 --> 00:49:05,907
Let's try to understand
What this is doing to you... 

580
00:49:05,995 --> 00:49:12,262
And your family.
Fuck.

581
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:15,999
Your grief for your son.
Your distance from Natalie.

582
00:49:16,096 --> 00:49:23,398
I'm sorry.
I just... the thing is,

583
00:49:23,487 --> 00:49:31,942
I... you know what the problem
With classical is? 

584
00:49:32,085 --> 00:49:38,700
It's so rigid and structured. 
You have to play the notes on the page! 

585
00:49:38,788 --> 00:49:43,686
There's no room for improvisation!
Oh, no...

586
00:49:43,775 --> 00:49:48,999
Take a look
Catch me I'm falling
Make up your mind to be free at last

587
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,699
Take a look
Falling
Make up your mind to be fully alive

588
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,799
Look
Falling
Embrace what's inside, 

589
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,799
Look
Falling
Replace what has died

590
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:01,291
Look
Falling
Make up your mind you'll survive

591
00:50:02,687 --> 00:50:05,842
Catch me, I'm falling
Unresolved loss can lead to depression.

592
00:50:05,927 --> 00:50:08,883
Catch me, I'm falling
And fear of loss to anxiety.

593
00:50:08,973 --> 00:50:13,404
Flying head-first into fate
Catch me, I'm falling

594
00:50:13,488 --> 00:50:15,194
The more you hold to
Something you've lost,

595
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,275
Please hear me calling
The more you fear losing it.

596
00:50:18,365 --> 00:50:21,250
Catch me before it's too late
Depression, anxiety...

597
00:50:21,354 --> 00:50:23,999
Catch me before it's too late
Depression, anxiety - 

598
00:50:24,092 --> 00:50:27,116
Catch me before it's too late
One gives rise to the other.

599
00:50:27,209 --> 00:50:29,145
Catch me, I'm falling
It becomes a cycle.

600
00:50:29,227 --> 00:50:32,696
Catch me, I'm falling
Catch me, I'm falling

601
00:50:32,785 --> 00:50:35,920
Wouldn't you like to 
Be free from all of that, finally?

602
00:50:36,013 --> 00:50:39,539
Wouldn't you like to go home
And clear out his room,

603
00:50:39,625 --> 00:50:44,981
Maybe spend some time with your daughter
And let your son go at last?

604
00:50:45,898 --> 00:50:49,277
Uh, should we go?
Yes.

605
00:50:49,365 --> 00:50:55,594
Mom.
Yes, I would.

606
00:51:12,424 --> 00:51:17,934
This is good, Di. 
It's a good step.

[ 12. I Dreamed a Dance. ]

608
00:51:58,787 --> 00:52:12,044
I saw you light the ballroom
With your sparkling eyes so blue

609
00:52:14,018 --> 00:52:23,208
Graceful as an angel's wing
I dreamed a dance with you

610
00:52:28,677 --> 00:52:40,284
You whispered slyly, softly
You told me you would be true

611
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:51,015
We spun around a thousand stars
I dreamed a dance with you

612
00:52:56,002 --> 00:53:08,067
I know the night is dying dear
I know the day will dawn

613
00:53:08,992 --> 00:53:19,622
The dancers may disappear
Still the dance goes on

614
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:33,317
And on
I'll wake alone tomorrow

615
00:53:34,724 --> 00:53:47,422
The dream of our dance is through
But now until forever love

616
00:53:48,372 --> 00:54:00,451
I'll live to dance with you
I'll dream my love

617
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:10,571
I'll live my love
And I'll die to dance with...

[ 13. There's a World. ]

There's a world,
There's a world I know

620
00:54:22,014 --> 00:54:31,633
A place we can go
Where the pain will go away

621
00:54:32,248 --> 00:54:40,474
There's a world
Where the sun shines each day

622
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:50,637
There's a world, 
There's a world out there

623
00:54:51,683 --> 00:55:00,183
I'll show you just where
And in time I know you'll see

624
00:55:00,291 --> 00:55:10,993
There's a world
Where we can be free

625
00:55:13,866 --> 00:55:19,881
Come with me
Goodman, Diana.

626
00:55:20,009 --> 00:55:25,829
Come with me
Discovered unconscious at home.

627
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:35,393
There's a world where we can be free
Multiple razor wounds to wrists and forearms. 

628
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:41,995
Self-inflicted.
Come with me

629
00:55:42,129 --> 00:55:50,699
Saline, sutures, gauze, IV antibiotics. 
Isolated, sedated and restrained. 

630
00:55:52,233 --> 00:56:00,642
Damnit. ECT is indicated.
Wow. I mean, they still do that?

631
00:56:00,734 --> 00:56:03,971
We do. Yes.
It's the standard in cases like this.

632
00:56:04,058 --> 00:56:06,731
She's got a long history of
Drug therapy and resistance. 

633
00:56:06,834 --> 00:56:10,556
She's acutely suicidal.
It's really our best option.

634
00:56:10,648 --> 00:56:13,850
Well, that's kind of terrifying.
It's not.

635
00:56:13,938 --> 00:56:17,654
The electricity involved is barely enough
To light a one-hundred-watt bulb.

636
00:56:17,753 --> 00:56:22,620
Oh. If it's just a hundred-watt bulb.
It's safer than crossing the street,

637
00:56:22,711 --> 00:56:25,334
And the short-term success rate 
Is over eighty percent.

638
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:29,199
I thought she was better.
Sometimes, patients recover

639
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,052
Just enough strength to follow through
On suicidal impulses,

640
00:56:32,142 --> 00:56:40,562
But not enough strength to resist them.
Well, that seems very... fucked.

641
00:56:41,574 --> 00:56:47,949
Yes. Legally we need her consent.
Hospital policy is we need yours, too. 

642
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:52,093
I don't think she's gonna go for this.
Mr. Goodman, we can administer the ECT,

643
00:56:52,228 --> 00:56:56,585
And you can bring her home in ten days
Or we can keep her sedated

644
00:56:56,718 --> 00:57:01,198
For fortyeight hours, discharge her
And wait for her to try again. 

645
00:57:01,287 --> 00:57:07,063
Look, go home. Take the night. 
Talk to her in the morning.

[ 14. I've Been. ]

647
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:24,399
Standing in this room,
Well, I wonder what comes now

648
00:57:24,489 --> 00:57:29,369
I know I have to help her
But hell if I know how

649
00:57:29,502 --> 00:57:34,397
And all the times that I've been told
The way her illness goes

650
00:57:34,487 --> 00:57:38,431
The truth of it is 
No one really knows

651
00:57:39,315 --> 00:57:44,712
And every day this act we act
Gets more and more absurd

652
00:57:44,806 --> 00:57:49,853
And all my fears just sit inside me,
Screaming to be heard

653
00:57:49,989 --> 00:57:54,887
I know they won't, though,
Not a single word

654
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:57,848
I was here
At her side

655
00:57:57,982 --> 00:58:01,119
When she called, 
When she cried.

656
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:04,143
How could she leave me
On my own?

657
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:07,607
Will it work,
This cure?

658
00:58:07,741 --> 00:58:13,050
There's no way
To be sure

659
00:58:13,136 --> 00:58:18,142
But I'm weary to the bone
And whenever she goes flying

660
00:58:19,965 --> 00:58:23,144
I keep my feet right
On the ground

661
00:58:24,316 --> 00:58:31,061
Oh now I need a lift
And there's no one around

662
00:58:37,032 --> 00:58:42,510
Hey...
Hey...

And I've never had to face the world
Without her at my side

667
00:58:59,504 --> 00:59:04,643
Now I'm strolling right beside her
As the black hole opens wide

668
00:59:04,737 --> 00:59:09,565
Mine is just
A slower suicide

Okay, that's fair.
The after-effects are minimal.

How much memory you've lost
If you've lost it?

A bad influence on me?

This is your anesthesiologist;
Just breathe normally,

Relax, and count backward from one hundred,
And before you reach one

737

You'll be asleep. 
When you wake up,

When the bolt of lightning crashes
And it burns right through my mind

742

It's like someone drained my brain out
Set my frozen mind to thaw

Let the lethargy and pain out
While I stood and watched in awe

I am riding on the brightest buzz
I am worlds away from who I was

It's the winter wind, it's fire

01:07:45,774 --> 01:07:50,428
And it kills my deepest hunger
As it fills me with desire

It's my treatment.

Everything's different now.

It slits my skin 
And trips my brain

I feel the burn, 
But I don't feel the pain

Just go.

So let's start with something small
Something personal and pretty

871
01:18:16,077 --> 01:18:24,620
I bet you'll know these shiny things
They must be tacky trinkets from, 

872
01:18:24,713 --> 01:18:28,302
I guess, Atlantic City?
No, actually, Di

873
01:18:28,429 --> 01:18:31,638
They're our wedding rings
It's going well.

874
01:18:31,726 --> 01:18:36,239
Here's a flower from our wedding
It was such a sight to see

875
01:18:36,326 --> 01:18:40,602
And the ceremony everything
We'd hoped

876
01:18:40,695 --> 01:18:44,499
Umm, Dad...
Well, that's how I remember it

877
01:18:44,587 --> 01:18:48,140
So that's how it'll be
It was raining

878
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:50,596
It was Portland
You eloped

879
01:18:50,690 --> 01:18:56,112
I mean, Portland.
It's an open book to write here

880

We can get back

Didn't the doctor say...

884

The doctor said at the right time.
Oh. Well, then...

And I took pictures
Everywhere we went

888
01:19:27,717 --> 01:19:33,598
We saw the Painted Desert
The Grand Canyon and Aunt Rhonda

889
01:19:33,733 --> 01:19:37,600
And Nat learned
What her middle finger meant

Here's the first house
That we owned

891
01:19:41,230 --> 01:19:43,440
On Walton Way,
We loved that place

892
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:47,777
Then we built this one on land
That we both chose

893
01:19:47,912 --> 01:19:53,597
And here's a pic of all of us
With smiles on every face

894
01:19:53,726 --> 01:19:57,622
And the photo-shopping
Hardly even shows

895
01:19:57,712 --> 01:20:02,921
We're standing by a lake 
With all these ducks

896
01:20:03,059 --> 01:20:08,357
And who's this little chubby girl?
That's Natalie

897
01:20:08,486 --> 01:20:11,694

Here's the headline in the paper

Here's the house on Walton Way

Here's the damage to the Honda

906

Did we crush somebody's cat

Beneath the tire?
Yes, ours.

908

I made it to the school
Wait, you remember?

911

It was the year of too much Lithium
I hid out in the car

1158

[ 31. Maybe (Next to Normal). ]

1159

What'd he say?
He said I could do more ECT

1160
01:44:08,345 --> 01:44:12,336
Or go back on the meds.
And what are you gonna do?

1161
01:44:12,477 --> 01:44:18,645
I'm going to take you to your dance.
Mom...

1162
01:44:20,282 --> 01:44:23,910
It's time for you to start
Thinking of your own happiness.

1163
01:44:24,427 --> 01:44:28,912
It's not happiness.
It's Henry.

1164
01:44:30,437 --> 01:44:38,967
You love him.
Mom, you can't just walk out

1165
01:44:39,069 --> 01:44:46,325
On your doctor.
Maybe I've lost it at last

1166
01:44:47,091 --> 01:44:59,683
Maybe my last lucid moment has past
I'm dancing with death, I suppose

1167
01:45:00,856 --> 01:45:09,835
But really, who knows?
Could be I'm crazy to go

1168
01:45:10,272 --> 01:45:16,087
They say you should stay
With the devil you know

1169
01:45:17,930 --> 01:45:24,659
But when life needs a change
And the one devil won't

1170
01:45:25,926 --> 01:45:31,244
You fly to the devil you don't
So... what?

1171
01:45:31,402 --> 01:45:37,372
You're just going to wing it?
Maybe I'm tired of the game

1172
01:45:38,809 --> 01:45:43,768
Of coming up short of the rules, 
Of the shame

1173
01:45:44,093 --> 01:45:51,798
And maybe you feel that way, too
I see me in you

1174
01:45:53,515 --> 01:46:02,031
A girl full of anger and hope
A girl with a mother

1175
01:46:02,125 --> 01:46:10,116
Who just couldn't cope
A girl who felt caught

1176
01:46:10,250 --> 01:46:19,993
And thought no one could see
But maybe one day she'll be free

1177
01:46:20,081 --> 01:46:25,597
It's so lovely that you're sharing
No, really, I'm all ears

1178
01:46:25,688 --> 01:46:31,257
But where has all this caring been
For sixteen years?

1179
01:46:31,348 --> 01:46:37,132
For all those years I prayed 
That you'd go away for good

1180
01:46:37,274 --> 01:46:45,675
Half the time afraid that you really would
When I thought you might be dying

1181
01:46:45,772 --> 01:46:52,360
I cried for all we'd never be
But there'll be no more crying

1182
01:46:52,861 --> 01:46:58,661
Not for me
Things will get better, you'll see

1183
01:46:58,762 --> 01:47:04,071
Not for me
You'll see

1184
01:47:04,164 --> 01:47:09,603
Not for me
You'll see, you'll see

1185
01:47:09,743 --> 01:47:13,404
Not for me
You'll see

1186
01:47:15,896 --> 01:47:25,957
Maybe we can't be okay
But maybe we're tough

1187
01:47:26,048 --> 01:47:34,820
And we'll try anyway
We'll live with what's real

1188
01:47:34,949 --> 01:47:47,577
Let go of what's past
And maybe I'll see you at last

1189
01:47:49,578 --> 01:48:01,902
I don't believe you.
Seventeen years ago when... 

1190
01:48:01,996 --> 01:48:07,034
Your brother died of
An intestinal obstruction,

1191
01:48:07,127 --> 01:48:17,516
He was eight months old.
The doctors missed it,

1192
01:48:17,652 --> 01:48:22,935
And your father
And I didn't know anything.

1193
01:48:23,066 --> 01:48:29,588
We were kids,
Not much older than you.

1194
01:48:32,145 --> 01:48:36,095
I'm so sorry we never
Talked about that.

1195
01:48:36,189 --> 01:48:53,248
We wanted to give you a normal life,
But I realize I have no clue what that is.

1196
01:48:55,022 --> 01:49:03,897
I don't need a life that's normal
That's way too far away

1197
01:49:04,038 --> 01:49:09,828
But something next to normal
Would be okay

1198
01:49:11,187 --> 01:49:17,403
Yes, something next to normal
That's the thing I'd like to try

1199
01:49:17,536 --> 01:49:26,971
Close enough to normal
To get by

1200
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:42,432
We'll get by
We'll get by

1201
01:49:44,742 --> 01:49:52,078
Okay. 
Now, go to your dance.

1202
01:49:54,068 --> 01:49:55,413
[ 32. Hey #3/Perfect For You (Reprise). ]

1203
01:50:09,982 --> 01:50:13,609
Hey...
Hey...

1204
01:50:13,745 --> 01:50:21,225
You look like a star
A vision in blue

1205
01:50:21,317 --> 01:50:25,877
Oh, I do?
And you are!

1206
01:50:26,022 --> 01:50:32,424
Hey, you came...
Well, I said that I might

1207
01:50:33,076 --> 01:50:40,116
I thought we were through
Me and you

1208
01:50:40,206 --> 01:50:44,230
Not tonight
Will your mom be okay?

1209
01:50:44,330 --> 01:50:45,862
Well, she might be
Someday

1210
01:50:45,995 --> 01:50:49,898
But for now it's all fine?
She's still on my mind

1211
01:50:49,990 --> 01:50:51,857
Can you leave it behind?
Hey!

1212
01:50:51,946 --> 01:50:54,545
Stay, let's see this thing through
Hey!

1213
01:50:54,635 --> 01:50:59,435
Am I crazy?
I might end up crazy

1214
01:50:59,527 --> 01:51:02,859
I'll be here for you
You say that right here

1215
01:51:02,949 --> 01:51:07,926
But then give it a year
Or ten years or a life

1216
01:51:08,013 --> 01:51:11,510
I could end up your wife
Sitting staring at walls

1217
01:51:11,601 --> 01:51:14,744
Throwing shit down the stairs
Freaking out at the store

1218
01:51:14,873 --> 01:51:17,776
Running nude down the street
Bleeding out in the bath

1219
01:51:17,868 --> 01:51:23,113
Shhh...
Perfect for you

1220
01:51:23,247 --> 01:51:34,837
I will be perfect for you
So you could go crazy

1221
01:51:34,932 --> 01:51:39,415
Or I could go crazy
It's true

1222
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:48,902
Sometimes life is insane
But crazy,

1223
01:51:49,034 --> 01:51:56,307
I know I can do
Cause crazy is perfect

1224
01:51:56,445 --> 01:52:01,006
And fucked up is perfect
So I will be perfect

[ 33. So Anyway. ]

1227

So anyway, I'm leaving
I thought you'd like to know

1228
01:52:37,798 --> 01:52:44,053
You're faithful come what may
But clearly, I can't stay

1229

We'd both go mad that way
So here I go

1230

And anyway, I'm leaving
I guess that you can see

1231
01:53:06,807 --> 01:53:13,328
I'll try this on my own
A life I've never known

1232
01:53:13,423 --> 01:53:23,417
I'll face the dread alone
But I'll be free

1233
01:53:26,983 --> 01:53:35,378
With you always beside me
To catch me when I fall

1234
01:53:37,367 --> 01:53:42,885
I'd never get to know
The feel of solid ground at all

1235
01:53:44,084 --> 01:53:51,772
With you always believing
That we can still come through

1236
01:53:52,355 --> 01:53:59,123
It makes me feel the fool
To know that it's not true

1237
01:54:01,785 --> 01:54:06,671
What doctors call dysfunction
We try to call romance

1238
01:54:06,805 --> 01:54:10,559
And true, it's quite a trick to tell
The dancers from the dance

1239
01:54:10,648 --> 01:54:19,880
But rather than the chance take me
I'll take the chance

1240
01:54:20,844 --> 01:54:32,115
I'll take a chance on leaving
It's that or stay and die

1241

I loved you once and though
You love me still

1242
01:54:39,492 --> 01:54:52,461
I know it's time for me to fly
I loved you once and though

1243

I love you still
I know it's time for me to go

I am the one who stayed

I am the one
And you walked away

1248

And now you act like

First of all, we need some light

You can't sit here in the dark
And all alone, it's a sorry sight

Been a solution to my problems.

Someone for you to talk to?

1301
02:02:18,987 --> 02:02:26,287
No, no. I, uh... yes, I would.
Thank you.

1302
02:02:26,383 --> 02:02:33,309
And when the night has finally gone
And when we see the new day dawn

1303
02:02:33,402 --> 02:02:37,920
We'll wonder how
We wondered for so long, so blind

1304
02:02:38,051 --> 02:02:42,665
The wasted world we thought we knew
The light will make it look brand new

1305
02:02:42,752 --> 02:02:51,294
So let it
Let it

1306
02:02:51,384 --> 02:02:57,072
Let it shine
Shine

1307
02:02:57,163 --> 02:03:05,247
Shine
Day after day

1308
02:03:05,383 --> 02:03:14,785
We'll find the will to find our way
Knowing that the darkest skies 

1309
02:03:14,879 --> 02:03:24,177
Will someday see the sun
When our long night is done

1310
02:03:24,269 --> 02:03:29,487
There will be light
There will be light

1311
02:03:29,575 --> 02:03:37,967
There will be light
When we open up our lives

1312
02:03:38,099 --> 02:03:46,460
Sons and daughters, husbands, wives
Can fight that fight

1313
02:03:46,634 --> 02:03:53,882
There will be light
There will be light

1314
02:03:54,010 --> 02:04:08,594
There will be light
There will be light

1315
02:04:10,201 --> 02:04:13,388
THE END
