而不是安德鲁和那个无脑妹
Not Andre and that bobblehead.

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:06,550
我会报复他们俩
I'm gonna get back at the both of 'em.

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,980
- 冷静点 - 泽维尔拿我的主意抢了功劳

00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,210
让我教你一点报复别人的招数吧

我在背后操作 直到时机成熟
I pull the strings here until it's time.

You said you was gonna bring the heat, but damn!

25
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,320

Well, it's about time.

26
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,830
去年 我受到来自各方的攻击

27
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,230
帮派 FBI

不错啊 贾马尔还在戒毒所
Nice of you to announce

31
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,440
你就在这儿公布你那小专辑了
your little project while Jamal's still in rehab.

32
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,100
看来你还是觉得他对你有威胁
It must be because you're still threatened by him.

33
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,080
我都忘了他会做音乐呢
I forgot he was even doing music.

34
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,740
你应该先跟我说一声的 卢修斯
You should have given me the heads-up, Lucious.

35
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,150
按理说 我们都是联合首席执行官
Theoretically, we are co-CEO.

36
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,010
按理说 你还打算一直不理我呢
Theoretically, you weren't talking to me.

37
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,590
姐现在不就理你了吗
Well, I'm speaking to you now.

38
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,150
你要跟你歌迷说
You gonna tell your fans that

00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,490
你要退居二线做你的专辑了
you are stepping down to work on your project,

40
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,150
让我做首席执行官
leaving me sole CEO of Empire.

41
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,140
算是弥补你试图告密搞垮安吉洛的行为
That's for dry snitching, trying to destroy Angelo.

42
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,550
如果你想和我玩的话 咱们可以玩玩
Yeah, you play with me if you want to.

43
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,820
不 我不玩 我直接开战
No, I don't play. I war.

44
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,490
你想和我开战吗 酷琦
You want war, Cookie?

45
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,720
那就开战吧
Fire a shot.

46
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,930
你等着吧
Get ready.

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,800
雷米 玛: 混过街头的纽约MC 目前仅有的5位拥有冠单的女说唱歌手之一
前不久刚出狱 和麻辣鸡Nicki Minaj最近一直在撕逼

擦 连雷米 玛都请来了
Damn, Remy Ma.

48
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,000
我跟卢修斯说好了
I already talked to Lucious

49
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,570
要给提安娜做一首她自己的歌
about Tiana doing one of her tracks.

50
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,100
在没跟我商量的前提下
Before you talked to me?

51
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,150
别担心 你会在专辑里拥有自己的歌的
You're gonna get your own track on the album, don't worry.

52
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,910
屌炸天的雷米 玛
The incredible Remy Ma.

53
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,300
天啊 真是太赞了
Damn, girl, amazing.

54
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,810
还有我的兄弟 布里克
And my man, Brikk!

55
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,080
掌声送给他们
Give it up for them.

56
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,760
好了 如你们所知
Now, as y'all know,

57
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,290
我是在费城街头的枪火中成长的
I was forged in the fires of Philadelphia streets.

58
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,530
那些经历让我创作出
And I took that energy and I turned it

59
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:50,350
一张又一张的专辑
into one album, into another platinum-selling album,

60
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,590
一张又一张的白金唱片
into another platinum-selling album.

61
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,300
而现在 凭着 地狱之火 这张专辑
And now, with Inferno,

62
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,270
我将重回嘻哈世界的巅峰
I retake my rightful place at the top of hip-hop,

63
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,020
- 我的地盘的巅峰 - 那是谁
- at the top of my game. - Who is that?

64
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,530
再创帝国娱乐的巅峰
At the top of the Empire!

65
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,230
发生什么事了
What's going on?

66
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,770
快看看她是谁
Yo, man, check her out.

67
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,760
大家好啊
Hello, everybody!

68
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,680
这是卢修斯最亲爱的妈妈
This is Lucious Lyon's dear mama.

69
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:19,440
莉亚 沃克
Leah Walker.

70
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,960
- 莉亚 沃克 - 她不是死了吗
- Leah Walker? - Didn't she die?

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,620
她在后台 对自己的儿子在这儿
And she was so excited backstage to watch her baby boy

72
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,130
说着自己的成就 感到很激动
out here, talking about all his fabulousness.

73
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,400
她只想到这个舞台上
She just want to come out

74
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,300
跟你们打声招呼 你说吧 妈妈
here and tell y'all hey. Go ahead, mama.

75
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,170
嗨
Hi.

76
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,810
按照 Boom Boom Boom Boom 的MV 她不是自杀了吗
Didn't she commit suicide in the "Boom Boom" Video?

77
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,700
我是莉亚
I'm Leah.

78
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,450
还不快去解围 周
Yo, get out there, Cho!

79
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,720
我是德怀特的
I'm Dwight's...

80
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,820
嘿 各位
Hey, everybody.

81
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,430
你们已经有了宣传资料了
You guys have your press packets.

82
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,520
卢修斯马上要去
Lucious is on his way to

83
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,560
录音室开始制作 地狱之火 了
the studio right now to start work on Inferno.

84
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,690
与此同时
In the meantime,

85
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,580
你们可以在帝国极度流上获取专辑的最新动态 谢谢各位
please check for updates on Empire XStream. Thanks, guys.

86
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,330
你是骗子
You a liar!

87
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,460
她不是死了吗
I thought she was dead!

88
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,140
这一战开得如何
How was that for a shot?

89
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,710
是不是正中要害
Hit any vital organs?

90
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,590
作为联合首席执行官 她知道她是在破坏自己的公司吧
I mean, as co-CEO, she knows she's sabotaging her own company.

91
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,580
或许她已经发泄完了
Well, maybe she's got it out of her system.

92
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,090
酷琦不是这样的人 如果她想要开战
Nah, not Cookie. And if she want war,

93
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,660
我也奉陪到底
I'm gonna give it to her.

94
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,030
好吧 那待会见
All right, I'll see you in a bit,

95
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,150
- 我要去上厕所 - 去吧
- I'm gonna hit the head. - Yeah.

96
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,230
我为内莎定下了极度流的明日之星秀
I got Nessa booked for the XStream Next Up Showcase.

97
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,540
那会成为她的第一个单人演出
It'll be her first solo set.

98
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,850
我很喜欢 做得好 小泽
I love it. Good stuff, X.

99
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,910
谢谢
Thank you.

100
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,240
做得好
Good stuff?

101
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,760
这毫无道理可言 哈基姆和提安娜的专辑都发布得
That makes zero sense. Both Hakeem and Tiana have albums dropping

102
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,410
- 比内莎早 - 确实 不过我是你老板
- before Nessa. - Yeah, but I'm your boss.

103
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,820
安德鲁是我老板 所以你想想吧
Andre is mine, so just do the math.

104
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,200
要这么说
Here's some math.

105
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,290
我在董事会里的表决权可和安德鲁一样大
I have as many voting shares on the board as Andre.

106
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,300
董事会可没有参与到
Well, the board is not involved

107
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,560
公司的日常运作中啊 哈基姆
in the day to day of the company, Hakeem.

108
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,300
酷琦想要提安娜上 你就得让她上
Cookie wants Tiana, so that's what she's gonna get.

109
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,400
老爸
Pop.

110
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,910
现在
So...

111
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,270
来投票表决是让
vote on the table is whether

112
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,810
内莎还是提安娜上台演出
to feature Nessa or Tiana at the showcase.

113
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,840
你是固执还是傻
Yo, are you hardheaded or stupid?

114
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,240
老妈早就定下了
Mom already approved.

115
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,650
你妈定下了谁
Your mom approved who?

116
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,110
提安娜
Tiana.

117
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,220
那就这样决定了
Then it's settled.

118
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,590
让内莎上场
It's Nessa that gets the showcase.

119
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,420
老爸 等等 你不能这么做
Dad, wait, you can't be doing this.

120
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,590
就这么决定了
End of story.

121
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,600
会议结束
We're done here.

122
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,370
- 嘿 贝基 听着 - 你不用说什么抱歉了
- Hey, Becky, listen. - You can save your sorrys,

123
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,240
泽维尔 我不想听
Xavier, I don't want them.

124
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,840
呵呵 你再跟刚才那样在老板们面前顶撞我
No, you come at me in front of the bosses like that again,

125
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,640
我就把你炒了
I will fire you.

126
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,550
这抱歉听着怎么样
How's that sorry for you?

127
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,340
好了 我一抵达波士顿就打给你
All right, so I'm-a hit you when I land in Boston.

128
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,230
你一定要去吗
You really have to go, huh?

129
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,260
是啊
Yeah.

130
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,250
但愿这个杰斯能够有种
I hope this Jayce plays ball.

131
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,850
他们手上有全部的文件了 是吧
I mean, they got all the files, right?

132
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,980
包括那份他们
Including the citation

133
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,000
在我酒驾时截住我的引证
from when they pulled me over for that DUI.

134
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,350
仅那份文件不足以证明事发时我也在
That alone doesn't place me anywhere near that lake

135
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,370
卡拉淹死的湖附近
where Carla drowned.

136
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,100
卡拉
Carla.

137
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,640
你知道吗
You know what?

138
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,210
在没看见那份文件之前
I couldn't even remember her name

139
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,720
我甚至都想不起她的名字
till I saw it in that file.

140
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,110
我只是那晚在派对上遇见她而已
I mean, I just met the girl at that party that night.

141
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,520
那时
It was...

142
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,450
她看上去很不错
She seemed like she was nice.

143
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,590
那杰斯呢
And Jayce?

144
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,970
杰斯 我也不太了解他
Jayce, I didn't know him that well, either.

145
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,800
我们一起上小学
I mean, went to grade school together.

146
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:46,530
他因为过失杀人坐了六年牢
He ended up doing six years for involuntary manslaughter.

147
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,180
那次拘捕记录已经封存了 但
The arrest records are sealed, but...

148
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,650
学校里没有人再得到他的消息
...nobody from school ever heard from him,

149
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,710
所以要是我能让他
so if I could just get him

150
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,320
为我做证 那
to make a statement, then...

151
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,900
不用担心我
You know what, don't worry about me.

152
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,220
贾马尔已经很让你担心了
You got a lot on your plate with Jamal.

153
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,200
你今天去探视贾马尔吗
You see your boy today, huh?

154
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,720
要见到儿子了 开心吗
You excited to see Jamal?

155
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,030
自从我让他进戒毒所后 这是我第一次见他
It's the first time since I put him in rehab.

156
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,360
没错
That's right.

157
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,390
我很害怕 安吉洛 我只是
I'm so scared, Angelo. I just...

158
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,220
想要我那个健康 头脑清醒 坚强的儿子回来
I want my baby back, healthy, sober and strong.

159
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,210
我知道
I know.

160
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,670
会的
You will.

161
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,110
你只要相信他就好
Hey, just believe in him.

162
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,440
好吗
All right?

163
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,410
好吗
All right?

164
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,150
- 好 - 你看上很美
- Okay. - You look good.

165
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,680
谢谢
Thank you.

166
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,120
下午好
Good afternoon.

167
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,590
我是卡茨医生 贾马尔的治疗师
I'm Dr. Katz. I'm Jamal's therapist.

168
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,090
贾马尔怎么样
How's Jamal doing?

169
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,590
让他自己跟你说吧
We'll wait for him to tell you.

170
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,630
打扰下 你们这有音响系统吗
Excuse me, do you have a sound system in here?

171
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,090
我想让我哥听听我最近做的一些新歌
I want my brother to hear some new stuff I've been working on.

172
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,370
恐怕你得再等三个星期直到
I'm afraid you'll have to wait another three weeks until...

173
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,680
晴天康复中心不信音乐疗法那一套
Sunny Day Recovery Center doesn't believe in music.

174
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,410
这是这个难民营的众多蠢规则之一
Just one of the many stupid rules at this dire refugee camp.

175
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,470
托莉 这是一个私人家庭会议
Tory, this is a private family session.

176
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,010
托莉 阿什
Yo, Tory Ash.

177
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,210
哈基姆 里昂
Yo, Hakeem Lyon.

178
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,870
还有安德鲁
Oh, and Andre.

179
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,980
以及里昂家女王本人
And the mama bear Lyon herself.

180
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,070
近来如何 酷琦
What's up, Cookie?

181
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,790
- 托莉 - 放松点 乡巴佬
- Tory. - Relax, cornball.

182
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,560
我就是打声招呼
I'm just saying hello.

183
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,220
就贾马尔跟我说的情况看
From what Jamal's told me,

184
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,540
我很惊讶你们里昂家族的小子居然没都进戒毒所
I'm surprised all your little Lyon cubs aren't in rehab.

185
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,050
别惹我 小姑娘 今天老娘没心情
Don't try me, little girl, not today.

186
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,760
- 省省吧 - 哦 酷琦 我可以惹你
- Please. - Oh, Cookie, I could try you,

187
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,730
不过我还是等卢修斯来了再去惹他吧
but I think I'd rather wait and try Lucious instead.

188
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,210
嗯 你是该干这种找死的事
Oh, yeah, you should do that, 'cause you'll stay alive.

189
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,170
我已经告诉你他不会来了
I already told you he's not coming.

190
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,510
想必你们都见到了我酷炫狂拽的好基友 托莉
I see y'all met my crazy-ass friend, Tory.

191
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,450
- 好运 - 谢谢
- Good luck. - Thank you.

192
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,690
- 嗨 妈 - 贾马尔
- Hey, Ma. - Jamal.

193
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,180
- 你看起来气色不错 - 谢了 妈
- You look good. - Thanks, Mom.

194
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,320
- 好久不见 哥们 - 好久不见
- What's up, bro? - What's up, brother?

195
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,430
- 好久不见 德鲁 - 挺吊呀 特洛伊阿什
- What's up, Dre? - Damn. Tory Ash.

196
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,070
自从她在芬威公园全裸上台
The whole world is still wondering what happened to her

197
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,140
全世界都想知道她究竟遭遇了什么
ever since she stripped butt naked onstage at Fenway Park.

198
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,040
放尊敬点 哈基姆 那是个染病的女子
Show some respect, Hakeem. The woman has an illness.

199
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,200
呵呵 你对这种病肯定挺了解
Yeah, you would know a lot about that,

200
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,310
- 是不 - 闭嘴 小子
- wouldn't you? - Shut up, boy.

201
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:07,310
是呀 她曾经是一个巨星 而且璀璨动人
Yeah, she was a big star. I mean, brilliant, too.

202
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,530
- 是 - 但是海洛因把她从云端
- Yeah. - That heroin knocked her ass

203
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,770
拽了下来
right out the sky.

204
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,120
她在芬威的那场演出简直堪称悲剧
She had that meltdown at Fenway.

205
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,730
她不是被发现昏迷在一家破烂的小旅馆里吗
Didn't they find her in a coma at some dingy motel?

206
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,250
里昂女士 我不得不提醒你 别散布
Mrs. Lyon, I have to ask you not to indulge in gossip

207
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,820
关于其他房客的流言
about other the residents.

208
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,430
抱歉
Sorry.

209
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,900
现在 我们是要等一下里昂先生 还是
Now, should we wait for Mr. Lyon, or...?

210
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,920
像贾马尔说的 他父亲不会来了
like Jamal said, his father ain't coming.

211
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,650
他爸爸怎么了
His father is what?

212
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,070
- 我儿子怎么样了 - 爸
- How's my boy? - Dad.

213
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,400
看看你
Look at you,

214
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,840
神清气爽
all bright-eyed and strong

215
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,480
蓄势待发
and ready for the world.

216
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:44,140
我宝贝儿子是怎么戒掉拜他妈妈所赐的
How's my boy doing recovering from those addictive drugs

217
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,490
毒瘾的
his mama got him hooked on?

218
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,650
卢修斯 你在这儿站着 就不能给这个家盼点儿好吗
Lucious, if you gonna be here, can you be here for the family?

219
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,070
听到你说这种话也是很讽刺
That's rich, coming from you.

220
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,890
我相信贾马尔非常开心看到家庭团聚
I'm sure Jamal is happy that his whole family is here.

221
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,240
贾马尔
Jamal,

222
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,990
你想告诉他们你怎么想的吗
do you want to tell them what's on your mind

223
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,000
- 在你戒掉毒瘾的过程中 - 好的
- at the halfway point? - Sure.

224
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,510
嗯
Um, well...

225
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,680
第一周我简直生不如死
...first week was absolute hell.

226
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,570
再不想经历毒瘾发作的感觉了
I don't ever want to go through withdrawal again.

227
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,840
我们知道你不会重蹈覆辙的 兄弟
And we know you won't, bro.

228
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,200
是啊 如果你能保持
Yeah, if you stay clean.

229
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,940
如果是什么意思
What do you mean, "If"?

230
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,720
他已经戒毒了
He is clean.

231
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,180
- 对吧 贾马尔 - 百分之百戒毒了
- Right, Jamal? - Completely clean.

232
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,860
你知道 这是
You know, that's...

233
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,560
这就是为什么我想回家
that's why I want to go home.

234
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,960
- 什么 - 我要回家
- What? - I need to go home.

235
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,700
我要回家 有一个旋律一直盘旋在我的脑海中
I got this... this melody that's in my head.

236
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,810
在我于此的每分每秒都催绷着我的神经
It's been pushing me the entire time that I've been here,

237
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:33,810
我需要在我忘记这个旋律之前
and I need to get to the

238
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:33,820
赶去录音室 把这首歌做出来
studio and I need to lay it down before I lose it.
我需要在我忘记这个旋律之前
and I need to get to the

239
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,840
赶去录音室 把这首歌做出来
studio and I need to lay it down before I lose it.

240
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,380
所以 你的身体恢复了 我很高兴
So, your body is healed... I get that...

241
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,000
但是你还得住在这 直到这个疗程结束
but you need to stay and finish this program.

242
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,610
妈 要我完成这个疗程
Okay, Ma, I need to finish the program.

243
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,980
就跟要我把你之前倒掉的药磕掉一样
I also need to finish the pills in the drain.

244
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,230
对不起妈 我不该那么说
I'm sorry, Ma, that was messed up.

245
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,590
这么说对你并不公平 对不起
That wasn't fair to you, I'm sorry.

246
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,860
我给你那些药 是因为我看到我的儿子痛不欲生 贾马尔
I gave you those pills because I saw you were in pain, Jamal.

247
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,270
别 说实话
No, tell the truth.

248
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,460
你给他这些药是因为你需要他
You gave him those pills because you needed him

249
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,540
在那场演唱会上表演
to perform at that event.

250
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,180
你也很矛盾 因为你不得不在
You also was conflicted because you had to choose

251
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,880
你的儿子和你的男朋友
between the needs of your boyfriend

252
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,080
的需求之间抉择
or the needs of your son.

253
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,940
- 你不知道他对安吉洛做了什么 - 我对安吉洛做了什么
- You don't know what he did to Angelo. - What I did to Angelo...

254
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,590
- 里昂先生 里昂太太 - 你能他妈的闭嘴吗
- Mr. And Mrs. Lyon... -  Would you shut the hell up?

255
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,250
我对安吉洛做的远不及
It's not half as bad as

256
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,750
你对公司和帝国娱乐这块招牌所造成的影响恶劣
what you did to Empire and to Empire's name.

257
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,350
贾马尔和我都厌倦了为家族名声洗白
Jamal and I are sick and tired of cleaning up the family name.

258
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,840
你都已经不应该还
It's a name you're not even supposed to have

259
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,810
- 冠以这个姓氏 - 是啊 因为你建立了一切
- in the first place. - Oh, right, cause you built everything...

260
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,820
- 你名字里就不该带着里昂 - 那是呀 你建立的这一切
- First or last name. - You built everything...

261
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,830
嘿 伙计
Hey, what's up, papa.

262
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,390
给我一个热狗
Let me get one of them dirty dogs.

263
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,500
这些都是犹太净食 对吧
They're Kosher, right?

264
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,700
给您
There you go.

265
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,950
谢谢
Gracias.

266
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,830
没啥东西比得上一个好吃的热狗
Ain't nothing like a good pimp steak.

267
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,560
劳驾给我点餐巾纸好吗
Hand me a couple napkins, will you?

268
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,270
谢谢
Thank you.

269
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,800
你确信
And you're sure

270
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,580
FBI正在调查弗兰克 盖哲思的谋杀案
it's about Frank Gathers' murder?

271
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,180
我的意思是 这只是斯威特沃特探员的一家之言
I mean, so says Agent Sweetwater.

272
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,040
在我看来
And the way I figure it,

273
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,410
有人获得了轻松出狱的机会
somebody scored a "Get out of jail free" Card.

274
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,190
然后塔里克安排他去大陪审团作证
And Tariq got him lined up to testify to a grand jury

275
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,830
是你下令杀了弗兰克 盖哲思
that you're the one who ordered the hit on Gathers.

276
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,490
所以 我是说你想想
I mean, so you tell me, I mean,

277
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,980
有谁可能是这个告密者呢
d-does anybody come to mind?

278
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:33,060
盖 他远在隆波克（加州城市）
Well, Guy, he's back at Lompoc.

279
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,400
而米奇在泽西中了枪
And Mikey caught a bullet up in Jersey,

280
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:38,160
所以
so...

281
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,610
嫌疑人就只剩下了
that leaves

282
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,910
一个人 鲍比 金
one man, Bobby King,

283
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,470
又称 告密的杂种
A.K.A. Rat bastard.

284
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,710
- 是巴巴（鲍比的昵称） - 就是巴巴
- Bam-Bam. - Bam-Bam.

285
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,760
想来我还给了他不少钱
And to think I spent

286
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,860
来医治她女儿的白血病
a bunch of money on his daughter's leukemia bills,

287
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,280
然而她还是死了
and she still died.

288
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,780
我知道了这个名字
I got the name.

289
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,680
我会找到巴巴的藏身之所的
I'll find out where Bam-Bam's hiding.

290
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,360
听着 瑟斯第
Look, Thirst?

291
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,450
关于我妈妈出现在新闻上的事
You know, this business about my mama

292
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,720
你懂的
and the press, you know...

293
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,030
要特别留意
keep an eye on it.

294
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,320
好的 没问题
Yeah, it's not a problem.

295
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,640
我会好好看着她
I'll keep her in my sights.

296
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,550
巴巴
Bam-Bam.

297
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:20,450
看起来不错 他们终于正确地把我的名字拼出来了
Looking good, and they finally spelled my name right.

298
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,420
看起来有人正在平步青云啊
Looks like somebody's moving up in the world.

299
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,990
祝贺 老兄
Congratulations, brother.

300
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,180
谢谢
Thanks.

301
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,460
你听说了我帮内莎搞定的好事了吗
You hear about what I hooked up for Nessa?

302
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,080
嗯 听说了 明日之星秀
Yeah, the, uh, Next Up Showcase.

303
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,050
这不错
It's good.

304
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,950
她应得的
She deserves it.

305
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,400
这只是个垫脚石 老兄
Well, stepping stones, my friend.

306
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,160
计划的第一阶段
Phase one of the plan.

307
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,970
说到这个计划
Speaking of the plan,

308
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,060
你知道的
you know...

309
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,440
地狱之火 估计会屌得很
Inferno 'bout to be a monster.

310
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,180
卢修斯会比以往更加强大
Lucious is about to be bigger than ever.

311
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,310
就目前而言 你无法从他那偷走帝国娱乐
There's no way you're stealing Empire from him right now.

312
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,810
我没有说我要从他那偷走帝国娱乐
I didn't say I was gonna steal it from him.

313
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,350
我是说 我要杀了他
I said I'm gonna kill him.

314
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:04,270
当卢修斯忙着制作 地狱之火 我们就私下操作
While Lucious is making Inferno, we'll be making moves,

315
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,760
招兵买马
mounting an army.

316
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,840
兵马
An army?

317
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,630
对的
That's right.

318
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,260
你是指我的人
You mean my guys?

319
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,630
我想说他们是我们的人 肖恩
I'd like to think of them as our guys, Shine.

320
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,010
欢迎来到帝国娱乐
Welcome to the Empire.

321
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,020
我写了一份解释声明
I've got a statement you can read explaining

322
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,890
你可以借此解释你只是在保护你母亲的隐私
you were just protecting the privacy of your mother.

323
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,750
我几时怕过这些了
When have you ever known me not to come off the dome?

324
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,430
我确信你们有很多的问题
I'm sure you got a bunch of questions,

325
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,500
所以我们干脆打开天窗说亮话
so why don't we just push to the punch?

326
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,280
你们想问我的母亲 对吧
You want to ask about my mother, right?

327
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,120
是的
Yes, we do.

328
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,500
好 但是这是一个非常隐私的事情
Well, that's a very private

329
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:46,510
它的处理自然也是私密的
matter and it's being handled privately.
好 但是这是一个非常隐私的事情
Well, that's a very private

330
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,510
它的处理自然也是私密的
matter and it's being handled privately.

331
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,840
但我确实有一个问题想问你们
But what I do have is a question for you.

332
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,440
你们准备选谁当市长
Who are you voting for for mayor?

333
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,200
因为我知道我支持约翰 米克斯
Because I know I'm endorsing John Meeks.

334
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,380
你们难道不觉得纽约是时候
Don't you think it's time

335
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,780
需要一个像约翰 米克斯这样极富领导素质
that New York had a mayor that had the leadership qualities

336
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,750
与领导才干的市长吗
and the integrity of someone like John Meeks?

337
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,610
你们知道 他可不像安吉洛 杜布瓦
You see, he's not a criminal,

338
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,190
那样是个罪犯
like Angelo Dubois.

339
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:11,260
他从来没有任一位女士溺死于车中
He would never leave a woman to drown in a car

340
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,660
只因为他想逃避酒驾的罪名
because he was trying to avoid a DUI.

341
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,330
实际上 为了缅怀那个很多年前去世了的年轻女子
In fact, in honor of that young woman who died so many years ago,

342
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:21,360
我将要提供三十万美金的奖励
I'm going to offer a $300,000 cash reward

343
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,660
给任何一个掌握相关信息
for anyone that has any information

344
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,070
可以使嫌犯先生定罪的人
that can lead to the conviction of Mr. "Dubious" Dubois.

345
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,650
你在做什么
What are you working on?

346
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,380
有东西在我的脑海中和灵感撞了个满怀
Oh, something that was in my head.

347
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,820
不过 这里的声效还真是很棒啊
Yo, the acoustics here are crazy, though.

348
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,090
我知道 挺棒的 是吧
I know. It's kind of amazing, right?

349
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:21,630
在我来这之前 
Before I came in here, man, just...

350
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,930
我有音乐 激情
the music, the passion, just...

351
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,500
没人能追得上我
...couldn't nobody catch me.

352
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,700
谁也不能对我指手画脚
And they couldn't tell me nothing.

353
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,270
我知道
I know, right?

354
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:38,140
那种火一般的激情 好像所有的东西都在高压下迸发
That fire, it's like everything was high pressure.

355
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,010
我以为我在飞翔
I felt like I was flying.

356
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,490
我以为我可以依靠自己撬动世界
I felt like I could propel myself off the Earth

357
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,780
只要我想
if I wanted to.

358
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,250
哦 天啊 我真怀念那种感觉
Oh, God, I miss that so much.

359
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,460
那是世界顶级之嗨
It's the best high in the world.

360
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,400
说实话 我也很怀念那种感觉
I can't lie, I miss it, too.

361
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,830
总是在天马行空
Was always flying.

362
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,870
那我们为什么不去重拾那种激情呢
So why don't we go get it?

363
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,390
欢迎来到 明日之星秀
Welcome to the Next Up Showcase,

00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:20,090

Suprised to see you here.

你是想要来领那份悬赏吗
What you want to collect on that reward?

367
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,240
你有什么关于杀人狂先生的信息给我吗
You got some info for me about Mr. Manslaughter?

368
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,630
你简直是青楼名媛 你天天把安吉洛的名字
You're such a fame whore. You got to keep Angelo's name

369
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,440
挂在嘴边 就是为了显示你没过气
on your mouth just to stay relevant?

370
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:58,650
是的 这就为什么这地方的标志上还挂着我的肖像
Yeah, that's why it's my face still on the logo in this place.

371
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,350
把内莎的麦克风重新接上 现在
Get Nessa's mic back on now!

372
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,400
别 内莎是专业的 她能搞定
Don't. Nessa's a pro. She can handle it.

373
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,800
老兄 现在把你手给我松开
Man, get your hands off me.

374
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,100
你能不能换点新花样玩儿
Might wanna start making some plays out of a new playbook.

375
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,900
这些把戏真是老套又无聊
All this is getting very old and very boring.

376
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,320
提安娜比内莎的咖位更大 笨蛋
Tiana is a bigger star than Nessa, boo-boo.

377
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,710
你应该感谢我为你这个傻逼演唱会
You ought to be thanking me for bringing more eyeballs

378
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,040
- 吸引了这么多眼球 - 你说啥

379
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,480

I got it lit in here. Turn up your hearing aid.

380
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,290

Her mic's back on. Now watch this.

婊砸 想搞我是没用的
Bitch, you tried it.

384
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:59,390
鉴于我是个淑女 这一次就不揍你了
I'm a lady, so I'm not gonna beat your ass this time.

385
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,700
就冲着你上回抢了我的时装秀 我才应该痛打你一顿
I should've beat your ass for stealing that fashion show,

386
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,470

臭婊子 你他妈
Bitch, who do you think you...

我还想多加一点低音进去 嘿 卢修斯
I want to add a little bit more bass. Hey, Lucious,

415
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,110

00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,140
你一直都给他供毒
you've been supplying him with his drugs.

423
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,950
要是我儿子因为过量吸毒出了什么事 你也得死
If my son ends up O.D.'ing, your ass is dead.

424
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,040
你在说什么呢 酷琦
What are you talking about, Cookie?

425
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,530
你怎么能还给他毒品呢
How you helping him by giving him drugs?

426
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,200
他很痛苦 你知道的
He's in pain, and you know that.

427
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,660
我做不到看着他痛苦却什么也不做
I couldn't just stand there and watch him suffer like that.

428
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,100
所以你就给他毒品 妈的 我真是受够了
So you give him drugs. Man, I'm sick of this.

有人在网上发了一个他和托莉 阿什的视频
Somebody posted a video on Snapchat of him and Tory Ash.

432
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:54,130
他们在一个脏乱的街区
They over in some dirty-ass neighborhood.

433
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,030
或者是什么毒窝里
Or some crack house.

434
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,170
他妈给我闭嘴
Shut your ass up!

435
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,960

438
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,460
直到我给她找到个保姆
until I can find her a babysitter.

439
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,990
那你再给我解释一下 怎么
So explain to me again how,

440
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,700
贝基 和我一起跑一趟 这句话
"Becky come on this run with me,"

441
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,690
就能理解成是你要帮我把泽维尔
is gonna translate into you helping me out

442
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,740
那个人渣除掉
with that scumbag Xavier?

443
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,520
我知道怎么对付小人
I know how to handle scumbags.

444
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,780
好的 放轻松点 神奇奶奶 我们知道你可以
All right, take it easy, Granny Gru. We know you do.

445
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,330
瑟斯第 我们在这是干嘛呢
Thirsty, what are we doing?

446
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,400
我们要帮卢修斯一个朋友的忙 坐好了
We're just doing a favor for a friend of Lucious. Sit tight.

447
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,910
她要坐进来了吗
She coming in here?

448
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,400
贝基 拜托 友好一点
Becky, please, be nice.

449
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,740
嗯哼
Mm-mm.

450
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,040
是你朋友吗
Is that your friend?

451
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,140
我不认识她
I don't know her.

452
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,640
兄弟 这给你
Here you go, man.

453
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,110
- 干得不错 - 谢谢您 先生
- Good looking out. - Thank you, sir.

454
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,020
还好吗 格雷琴女士
How you doing, Miss Gretchen?

455
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,050
噢 我迫不及待要见到我的宝贝了
Oh, I can hardly wait to see my Bam-Bam.

456
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,520
他真是个好儿子
He's such a good son.

457
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:49,050
他要把我送到亚利桑那州的一家养老院
He's moving me to a nursing home in Arizona.

458
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,090
嗯没错 他真的很棒
That's good. Oh, he's a good boy.

459
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,660
好了
All right.

460
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,660
我的德怀特当初就把我关在一家养老院
My Dwight had me locked up in one of those homes

461
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,030
关了好几百年
for over a hundred years.

462
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:58,600
那些地方很邪恶
Those places are evil.

463
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,370
好了 好了
Okay, okay...

464
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,950
我懂你为什么没有让我出去
I know damn well you ain't got me

465
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,870
帮你绑架这些老太太了
out here helping you kidnap these old ladies.

466
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,740
我可不做这种事
I am not doing a bid for this.

467
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,470
没有 她开玩笑的 别紧张
No, she just kidding, Gran. Just relax.

468
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,910
我像是要绑架你们吗
Do I look like a kidnapper to you?

469
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,920
- 像 - 真是谢谢你了好吗 我是个律师
- Yes. - I'm a lawyer, thank you very much.

470
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,080
我是在努力指导你什么才叫
All right? And I'm trying to instruct you on the virtues

471
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,450
看准时机再出手
of the perfectly-timed execution.

472
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,850
为此你需要耐心 小蚂蚱
For that, you need patience, Grasshopper.

473
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,450
好的 系好安全带 老姑娘们
All right, buckle up, golden girls.

474
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,390
你们坐在后面还好吗 需要开暖气吗
You good back there? You need the heat on?

475
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:22,760
看路
Watch the road!

476
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,090
贾马尔在哪 泰里
Where's Jamal, Tyree?

477
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,440
贾马尔 我没见过他
Jamal? I ain't seen him.

478
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,240
我告诉你 今晚你可不想跟我对着干
Look, you don't want no trouble with me tonight.

479
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,700
不然我拆了这烂录音室
I will tear this raggedy-ass studio down.

480
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,450
任何她没毁掉的东西 我会
And whatever she doesn't destroy, I will.

481
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,660
- 这是怎么了 卢修斯 - 怎么了 回答我的问题
- What's up, Lucious? - What's up?! Answer the question!

482
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:54,220
喂 喂 喂
Hey, hey, hey!

483
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,820
- 我没有在开玩笑 - 他在楼上 第一录音室
- Yeah, this ain't a joke. - He's upstairs, studio one.

484
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,320
你在这做什么 贾马尔
What you doing, Jamal?

485
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,180
你妈找你找得都快得心脏病了
Your mother almost had a heart attack looking for you.

486
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:24,380
你们以为呢 我在录一首歌
What y'all think? I'm recording a song.

487
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,930
听着 我会让韦伯在这儿搜一圈
Look, I'm-a have Webb run through this whole place.

488
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,790
只要我们发现一丝丝毒品的痕迹
We find one speck of drugs...

489
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,920
- 没错 - 老天呐
- That's right. - Oh, my God.

490
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,700
爸 我说过我已经完全戒掉了 我现在也是如此
Dad, I said that I am sober and clean, and I am.

491
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,100
那你为什么离开戒毒所了呢
Then why did you leave rehab?

492
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,110
听着 现在需要做的
Listen, what needs to happen

00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,860
所以你们就先
so y'all need to just...

496
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,290
你现在应该做的就是闭嘴
What you need to do is shut up.

497
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:41,560
- 噢 天呐 - 臭婊子
- Oh, Lord... - Bitch!

498
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:43,110
- 妈 妈 你听我 - 你就是

501
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,000
- 是啊 - 她不想的 她真的不想的
- Yeah. - She don't. She really don't.

502
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,990
- 咱们是不是得进入警戒状态 - 停 求你们了 爸 妈
- Why do have to go to DEFCON... - Please, stop. Ma, Dad!

503
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,570
妈 别说了
Mom, stop.

504
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,130
我现在想待的地方
Where I'm supposed to be

505
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,940
以及我想要做音乐的地方 就是这儿
and doing what I'm supposed to be doing is right here.

506
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,490
这里就是我的戒毒所
This is my rehab.

507
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,260

我很抱歉 走吧
I'm sorry. Come on.

511
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,060
你能相信我的 妈妈 相信我
You can trust me, Ma. Come on.

512
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,090
走吧 酷琦
Come on, Cook.

513
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,100
我在外面等你 录完了带你回家
I'll be out here to take you home when you're done.

514
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:22,880
抱歉各位
Sorry, y'all.

515
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,220
上菜啦
Order up.

516
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:40,840
妈妈
Mama?

517
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:45,780
妈妈
Mama!

518
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,890
嘿 巴巴 先别走
Hey, Bam, don't leave just yet.

519
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,110
卢修斯 你听我解释
L, man, let me explain.

520
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,450
不 你不用解释
No, you don't speak.

521
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,020
我来说
I speak.

522
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,550
你看 我知道发生了什么事 巴巴
You see, I understand how things happen, Bam.

523
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:24,120
我和FBI都知道 每个人都有他的弱点
Me and the Feds both know that every man has his weakness.

524
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,780
而你的弱点 就是外面那个亲切
And in your case, it's that sweet,

525
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,210
又慈祥 养育你长大
loving woman out there that raised you

526
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,120
并在你蹲监狱的时候抚养你女儿的女人
and then raised your little girl when you got locked up.

527
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,620
但是在咱们被关在一起的时候
But when you and I were locked up,

528
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,320
我承诺过要照顾她们
I made a promise to take care of them.

529
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:45,970
我也尽我所能去帮助你的女儿
And I did everything I could to help your little girl,

530
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,690
就算她已经过世
but now that she's gone...

531
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,800
我始终坚守诺言 照顾你的妈妈
...I still kept my word and took care your mama.

532
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:56,010
那么等你站在大陪审团面前的时候
The same way you're gonna remember your P's and Q's

533
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:58,360
你也应该要记得你的承诺
when you get in front of that grand jury.

534
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,840
很好 拿去吧
All right. Here you go.

535
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,190
我们把巴巴妈妈平安送回家
We got Bam-Bam's mother home safe and sound.

536
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:15,420
神奇奶奶也睡着了 感谢上帝
Granny Gru has gone night-night, thank God.

537
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,660
我刚去电台送了个爱心包裹
And I just dropped off the care package at WZVX.

538
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,430
任务都完成了
Check, check and check.

539
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:23,660
怎么了 是我忘了什么吗
What, am I forgetting something?

540
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:24,770
你忘了我
You forgetting me.

541
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,000
你是认真
Are you ser...

542
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:29,740
你用这辆破车载着我绕了泽西一圈就办了这么些破事
You got me driving all over Jersey on these dumbass errands.

543
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,570
我们什么时候才来说一下我的问题
When are we gonna talk about my problems though?

544
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,910
好吧 你先跟我说说 大急眼
All right, you know what? Explain it to me, Hot Pocket.

545
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:36,180
你为什么一直那么紧张那个乡巴佬泽维尔
Why are you still stressing out over that cornball Xavier?

546
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,800
哎呀 你不懂
Yo, you don't get it.

547
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,890
从他进入帝国娱乐以来 他就一直烦我
Ever since he got to Empire, he's been all up in my face

548
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,530
在暗地里使手段 还满口
and doing shady stuff, talking about,

549
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:45,520
噢 噢 这只是工作 这只是工作
"Oh, oh, it's just business, it's just business."

550
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,090
其实又是一副跟我有私仇的样子
But acting like it's personal with me.

551
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,560
你要知道 第一点
There you go. Lesson one.

552
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,560
没错 那是工作
It's business, of course.

553
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,860
但无论别人怎么告诉你 这种从来都是私仇
But no matter what anybody tells you, it's always personal.

554
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:56,240
好的 那我要怎么做
Okay, so what I do?

555
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,030
你还能做什么呢
You know what, what more can you do?

556
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,070
额
Yo.

557
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,900
没事的 别紧张姑娘
All right, relax, mama.

558
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,770
这不是给你的
That's not for you.

559
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,040
就让一切顺其自然
Just let the universe work its magic.

560
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,480
好吗
Okay?

561
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,710
老天会挺你的
It's got you.

562
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,710
又是少林和尚的那套扯淡
Type of Shaolin monk bull...

563
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,580
你知道吗 你浪费了我一整天
You know what? You have wasted my entire day.

564
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,870
浪费我的时间
Waste of time.

565
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,540
少林武当
Shaolin Wu-Tang.

566
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,520
所以里昂 卢修斯又赢了
So Lucious Lyon wins again.

567
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,630
你在这案子里的主要证人
You built this case up on one star witness,

568
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:28,100
巴巴 金 突然拒绝作证了
Bam-Bam King, who suddenly refuses to testify.

569
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,580
是啊 里昂肯定不知道又用什么手段搞定他了
Yeah, Lyon must've got to him somehow.

570
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,100
他杀了弗兰克 盖哲思 我可以证明
He murdered Frank Gathers, and I can prove it.

571
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,060
我需要更多的时间
I just need more time.

572
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:32,070
探员 到此为止 你的时间已经到了
Agent, your time is up; as of right now,
我需要更多的时间
I just need more time.

573
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,700
探员 到此为止 你的时间已经到了
Agent, your time is up; as of right now,

574
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,390
你不用参与这案子了 因为它结束了
you're off the case, 'cause it's closed.

575
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,560
什么 我还有别的线索啊 长官
What? But I have more leads, sir.

576
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,460
由于你事前隐秘了他是你的半个兄弟的事实
Any evidence against the target is tainted

577
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,890
导致任何关于目标的证据都不足采信
due to your omission of the fact that he is your half-brother.

578
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,440
我会让你带薪休假的
I'm putting you on paid leave.

579
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,270
杜布瓦先生的竞选终于能喘口气了
Mr. Dubois' campaign got a much needed breath of life

580
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:00,220
杰斯 琼斯出来证实 他已经为20年前的
when Jayce Jones came forward to confirm that he served time

581
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:02,430
卡拉 米尔斯溺水身亡事件
for the manslaughter death of Carla Mills,

582
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,970
以过失杀人的罪名服过刑了
who drowned in a lake over 20 years ago.

583
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,700
而且最重要的是 事发时
And most important, that Angelo Dubois

584
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:08,670
安吉洛 杜布瓦根本不在现场
was nowhere near the scene when it happened.

585
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,940
老天爷
God.

586
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,670
老爸使的招好阴
Dad went so low.

587
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,980
你还感到惊讶吗
Are you surprised?

588
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,080
习以为常却依然被刷新三观
Always and never.

589
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,250
怎么了
What?

590
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:27,620
我长话短说
I'm gonna keep this short...

591
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,220
只讲真话
and real.

592
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,340
你还在吸毒吗
Are you a dope fiend?

593
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:43,910
听着 我之前是吸毒了 妈
Look, I got caught up, Ma.

594
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:46,610
我并没有试图逃避这一点
I ain't even trying to run away from that.

595
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:49,580
但是我敢用我的音乐和所有发誓
But I swear on my music and everything else

596
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,510
我一直努力从中枪事件中恢复过来
that I've been fighting back for since I came back

597
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:55,180
我 我已经戒毒了
from the bullet, I... I'm done with the pills.

598
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,920
真的
Really.

599
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,360
我的精神太集中了 我甚至不想有任何
I'm so focused. I'm not even trying to have any kind of substance

600
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,610
事情去搅浑它
mess with that.

601
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,460
听你那么说我很高兴 宝贝
I'm happy to hear that, baby.

602
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,830
终于感觉一切都会变得好起来
Finally feels like everything's gonna be all right.

603
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,820
你没事了
You're okay.

604
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:18,680
安吉洛的事解决了
Angelo's situation is settled.

605
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,840
他已经重回竞选了 所以
He's back on his campaign, so...

606
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,710
是的 他很棒 是吗
Yeah, he's good, right?

607
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,010
以后就知道了
We'll see.

608
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,160
我的意思是 政治就是这样 他们只需要往你身上泼脏水
I mean, it's politics; all they got to do is say it,

609
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,820
你就永远洗不干净
it sticks to you like stink.

610
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,850
卢修斯所做的一切都是为了你
Lucious did all of that just for you.

611
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,260
这是一种扭曲的爱 老兄
That is a twisted kind of love, man.

612
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,460
我知道他在为他的下一步动作做准备
I know he's planning his next move.

613
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,840
现在 在我们开始之前
Now, before we get started,

614
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:07,070
让我们做一个简短的小决定
let's take care of a short order of business.

615
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,290
泽维尔
Xavier.

616
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:10,990
你被开除了
You're fired.

617
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:13,280
- 好吧 我们走 - 哇哦 别这样 兄弟 什么鬼
- All right, let's go. - Whoa, come on, man! What the hell?

618
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:16,530
让这个作为你们每一个人的反面典型
Let this serve as an example for each and every one of you.

619
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,870
如果我抓住任何人索要回扣
If I catch anybody getting kickbacks,

620
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:22,400
相信我 下一次的惩罚绝对比开除要惨得多
trust me, the next time you'll get much more than fired.

621
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,880
里昂先生 里昂先生 我从来没有对不起你过 兄弟
Mr. Lyon, Mr. Lyon, I would never do that to you, man.

622
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,070
- 我向上帝发誓 我是无辜的 - 无辜
- I swear to God, I'm innocent on this! - Innocent?

623
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,900
你去跟WZVX电台的节目主管说吧
Tell that to the program director over at WZVX.

624
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,480
你做事不地道 兄弟 不地道
You run a sloppy business, man, sloppy.

625
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,260
别这样 真的 这是一个谎言 贝基
Come on, now, that's a lie! Becky!

626
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:35,550
贝基 你知道我的 是吧 你了解我
Becky, you know me. All right? You know me.

627
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:36,990
你要为我做证 拜托
You need to vouch for me. Come on.

628
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:40,070
我可不知道你 老兄 公事公办
I don't know you, man. It's just business.

629
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,220
公事公办
"Just business"?

630
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,260
再见
Bye.

631
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,230
嗨 老兄 我是无辜的
Yo, I'm innocent, man!

632
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,070
嗨 我可没这么干
Yo, I didn't do this!

633
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:48,250
放开我
Get off me!

634
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,320
接着滚 别停
Go on out of here.

635
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,300
现在好戏已经结束了
Now that the fireworks are over,

636
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,270
我很确定你们都听说了我要做的新专辑
I'm sure you've all heard my announcement

637
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:57,230
地狱之火 虽然这个房间里某些人
about Inferno, even though it may have been muffled a bit by

638
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,290
-可能对此不太爽 - 卢修斯 听着
- certain people in this room. - Uh, Lucious, look,

639
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,510
所有这个房间的人
everyone in this room

640
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,180
都很忙 所以如果你能赶紧
is very busy, so if you could go ahead,

641
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,350
结束你要说的 那就太感谢了
and finish what you have to say, thank you.

642
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,850
我就快结束了
I'm getting there.

643
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:12,050
我们是里昂家族 因此 我们只玩大的
We are Lyons; therefore, we roar.

644
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:14,810
所以从现在开始 公司的每个员工
So from this point forward, each and every employee

645
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:17,170
首要任务就是
of this company, their number one priority

646
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,980
确保 地狱之火 的成功制作
is to make sure that Inferno is what it should be.

647
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,870
这是我正在制作的专辑
It's an album I'm producing.

648
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:27,100
我要帝国娱乐的顶级艺人参与进来
I'm going to have the top artists from Empire on it,

649
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,190
而且我希望我的儿子 贾马尔
and I'm hoping that my son, Jamal,

650
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:31,290
能不吝赐我一首歌
will bless me with a song.

651
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,040
现在 艺人监理部总监的位置
Now, seeing that the position of head of A&R

652
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,750
空了出来
has recently just opened,

653
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:39,040
我决定找一个配得上这个位置的人
I decided to fill it with someone that I feel is

654
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:41,450
来担此重任
worthy of such a position.

655
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,480
由于处于这个位置
And as a result of being in this position,

656
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,060
她承受了很多来自我的痛苦和煎熬
she's come to be under a great deal of anguish and fire

657
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,760
因为她曾经
from me because she's been

658
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:52,530
是我最大的评论家
my biggest critic, which in turn turned her

659
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:56,830
这也让她变了我最棒的盟友 她非常忠诚
into my greatest ally, and she's very loyal.

660
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,570
过去我对任命她在这个位置非常犹豫
And I was so hesitant to appoint her in this position

661
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,750
因为我不想
because I didn't want to

662
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:01,760
让她离开她的第一职责
take her away from her first responsibility,
因为我不想
because I didn't want to

663
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,880
让她离开她的第一职责
take her away from her first responsibility,

664
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:07,410
也就是做为一个母亲的职责
and that's the job of being a mother.

665
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:10,390
但她会像过去多年一样帮助我
But she will serve me as she has for years,

666
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:15,570
作为我的缪斯 点燃我内心的地狱之火
as my muse who has lit an inferno inside of me.

667
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,790
她是这个公司的创始核心
She is the DNA of this company,

668
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:22,190
我的妻子 阿妮卡 里昂女士
my wife, Mrs. Anika Lyon.

669
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,640
你们的新艺人监理部总监
Your new head of A&R.

670
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,620
谢谢
Thank you.

671
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:32,130
谢谢
Thank you.

672
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,770
祝贺
Congrats.

673
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,640
来吧 坐下
Come on. Take your seat.

674
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,620
哈 这位子已经为你备好了
Ha! Nice and warm for you.

675
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,640
嗯 嗯 嗯 这音乐很给力 卢修斯
Mm, mm-mm, that is fire, Lucious.

676
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,080
是的 地狱之火
Yeah, "Inferno."

677
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,600
这个名字很合适
The name fits.

678
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:26,090
怎么 你想找麻烦吗 酷琦
What, you want some trouble, Cookie?

679
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:30,280
不 不 我 我不想找麻烦 卢修斯
No, no, I-I don't want no trouble, Lucious.

680
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:33,220
我只是有些问题 只是这样
I just have some questions, is all.

681
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:38,060
就像 这里的这张专辑
Like, this-this album right here.

682
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:41,970
这是你的第一张金唱片
This was your first album to go gold.

683
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:45,270
现在 我记得在我进监狱之前
Now, I remember working on that six months

684
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:48,440
我可为此忙活了六个月
before I went to prison.

685
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:51,940
所以 到底谁是公司的创始核心呢 卢修斯 
So, whose DNA is in that, Lucious? Huh?

686
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:00,180
创始核心 小子 少来了
DNA. Boy, please.

687
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:04,760
她就是个婊子
Ain't nothing but a hood rat.

688
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,870
好吧
All right.

689
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:16,400
我们就玩一会
Let's play.

690
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:26,880
我告诉过你吗
Did I tell you, I watched you on TV

691
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,180
当帝国娱乐的第一张专辑被引入
in that dirty-ass rec room

692
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:34,200
音乐名人殿堂时 我通过丹伯里的
in Danbury when Empire's first album was inducted

693
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,120
那个肮脏娱乐室里的电视看着你
into the Music Hall of Fame.

694
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,130
谁是你那张专辑的缪斯
Who was your muse for that?

695
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,290
你闹够了没 贱人
You done, bitch?

696
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,530
啊 卢修斯 别靠近我
Huh, Lucious? Don't you come any closer.

697
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,770
把它放下
Put it down.

698
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:51,300
那时候谁是你这张专辑的缪斯 啊
Who was your muse on that, huh?!

699
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,740
那时候谁是你的缪斯 卢修斯
Who was your muse, Lucious?

700
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,510
噢 你还记得这个吗
Oh, do you remember this one?

701
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:57,770
我记得
Because I do.

702
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,440
是的 我在监狱里帮你来回传送磁带
Yeah, I sent tapes from the inside

703
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:03,580
帮你在外面制作这张专辑
back and forth with you while you worked on them out here.

704
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,090
噢 还有这一个
Oh! And this one.

705
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:11,660
这个是你不再来探望我以后弄的
This is when you stopped coming to visit me.

706
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,390
这张很垃圾
It was weak.

707
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,090
所有的评论家都是这么说的
All the critics said so.

708
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,660
是的 起来
Yeah, get up.

709
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:23,580
如果没有我 这一切都不会存在
None of this would've existed without me!

710
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:26,640
这些金唱片 荣誉奖章都不存在
Not those gold records! Not those plaques!

711
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,410
这个录音室也不会存在
Not this studio!

712
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,790
什么都不会存在
None of it!

713
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:32,680
所以你告诉我 卢修斯
So you tell me, Lucious.

714
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,930
告诉我谁的DNA贯穿了这一切
Tell me whose DNA is running all through it?

715
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,920
嗯
Huh?

716
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,680
谁才是那个身负重任的母亲 卢修斯
Who's the mother with the important job, Lucious?!

717
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,680
你告诉我
You tell me.

718
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:44,420
我给你生了三个儿字 贱人 三个儿子
I gave you three sons, bitch, three sons!

719
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:46,290
我还为你流过产
I had a miscarriage.

720
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,630
我在监狱呆了17年 所以你才能建立这个
I went to jail for 17 years so you could build this!

721
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,100
所以你才能建立这个帝国
So you could build this Empire!

722
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:59,600
是的 跟着我
Yeah, follow me!

723
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:02,290
我会告诉这儿有谁的DNA
I'll show you whose DNA is in here.

724
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,910
好 现在你完了
Okay, now you die!

725
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:07,180
你说里昂家族都是用吼的 好 现在让我听你吼两声
You said Lyons roar? Well, let me hear you roar.

726
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,880
是的 我来这儿就是为了制造噪音的
Yeah, I came here to make a lot of noise.

727
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:13,580
现在你死定了
Now you die!

728
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,190
滚
Go home.

729
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,860
我这只是刚刚开始
I'm just getting started. -

730
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:09,610
试图抹去我的存在 卢修斯
Trying to erase me, Lucious?

731
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:11,110
嗯
Huh?

732
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,280
在我为你付出一切之后
After all I done for you.

733
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:21,550
我为这个家付出了17年
I did 17 years for this family.

734
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,820
你是靠我才建立起这个公司
You built this company on my back.

735
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,930
你现在却想把这给那个贱人
And you just gonna give it to that bitch.

736
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,630
这就是你的计划吗 卢修斯
Is that your plan, Lucious?

737
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:35,300
嗯
Huh?!

738
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,200
放开我
Let go of me!

739
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,100
停下来
Stop. 

740
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,140
嗯 不
Mm-mm.

741
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:26,040
不
No.

742
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:29,650
我说过我跟你之间已经完了
I said I was done with you.

743
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,710
我是认真的
I meant that.
