等待
Waiting.

5

等生意
For business.

7
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,300
什么生意做到妓院来了
What kind of business you got in a cathouse?

8
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,060
我的生意
My business.

9
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,670
你得走
You need to go.

10
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,550
现在
Now!

11
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,940
她不是他的
She's not his.

12
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,930
那是谁的
Then whose?

13
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,860
我的
Just mine.

14
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,580
-女士  -怎么了

15
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,490
-你为什么锁门  -我在换衣服

16
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,238
我这衣服已经穿了三天了

17
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,260
有专门的更衣室啊
There's rooms for that.

18
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,600
我女孩睡觉呢 不能离开她
- My girl's asleep. I can't leave her.

19
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,290
听医生说
Heard from the doctor.

20
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,080
说什么
Yes?

21

趁你还走的了

我们一起等医生来吧
Let's both see him.

26
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,630
-我还醒着  -我困死了
-I'm awake. - I ain't.

27
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,270
这种晚上
This kind of night...

28
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,480
时间慢的就好像钟表倒着走一样
it's like the clock's running backwards.

29
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,590
不是周末人就没那么多
The middle of the week's always slow.

30
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,410
你好了解啊
Look who's the expert now.

31
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,400
不久不就能管理这地方了
Pretty soon you'll be running the joint.

32
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,630
不是吧
I don't know about that.

33
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,570
你知道你这么大的时候我在干嘛呢
What I was doing, I was your age?

34
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,270
啪啪
Pow-pow.

35
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,650
我十六岁就有了自己的帮派了

人们都很尊重我 我那时候很成功的

37
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,000

00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,190
你爸把我介绍给你妈了

39
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,840
-等等 他什么  -没事

有吃的了

45
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,360
该死的
Me cago en Dios.

46
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,980
他去哪了
Where did he go?

47
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,550
你干嘛呢
What are you doing?

49
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,920
早上再做吧

00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,490

They're starting to turn.

51
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,490
你来晚了
You came in late.

52
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,680
我走不了
I couldn't get out of there.

53
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,170
一个演讲接着一个演讲
It was just speech after speech.

54

-你讲了吗  -我哪能不讲啊
- Did you make one?  - I had to.

55

56
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,370
"尊敬的各位先生们
"Respected gentlemen of the hall,

57
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,180
"市长大人 海军队长凯尼特利
Mr. Mayor, Commodore Kaestner"...

58
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,770
"作为一种义务和荣耀
"I regard it as both a duty and a privilege

59
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,230
"我很注重人才的推进
to put forward a man

60
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,780
"作为一个有取之不竭的精力的人
whose energy is unquenchable,

61
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,090
"品行无可怀疑的人
whose character is unimpeachable,

62
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,720
"怀着无限忠诚的人"
whose loyalty is inexhaustible."

63
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,280
结构不错
A nice construction.

64
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,860
"在七月四号这一天 
"The next Alderman on the Fourth Ward

65
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,120
"向你们隆重介绍下届市议员及我儿时的好友
and boon companion of my youthful years,

66
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,490
"詹姆斯 派特里克 内亚力"
the Honorable James Patrick Neary."

67
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,250
但是呢
The thing is,

68
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,520
我一直觉得他只是个好水手
I've always considered him a real son of a sailor.

69
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,620
只要你给大家留下深刻印象就行了
As long as you made a strong impression.

70
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,360
他们都一直叫我纳吉
Everyone kept calling me Nucky.

71
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,040
-不是吧  -是啊
- Oh,no.  - Mm-hmm.

72
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,720
我叫纳吉 伙计们
My name's Nucky,boys.

73
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,880
我主管女士们 你们是干嘛的
I'm in ladies' garters. What's your line?

74
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,790
抽个"雪家"吧
Say,have yourself a "see-gar."

75
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,800
听起来这样吗
Is that what it sounds like?

76
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,200
怎么了
What's wrong?

77
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,550
你又恶心了吗
You nauseous again?

78
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,900
要叫医生吗
Should I fetch the doctor?

79
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,110
我就是睡不着
I just couldn't sleep.

80
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,180
晚餐的时候
I sat at that dinner

81
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,740
我看着他们背地里诋毁吉姆 内亚力
and watched them slap Jim Neary on the back.

82
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,090
他们之所以让他当市议员
They'll make him alderman

83
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,480
是因为海军准将想让他当
because that's what the Commodore wants.

84
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,390
我为他服务了13年

85
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,170
都没人提我的名字
Never even says my name.

86
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,820
你会被认可的
You'll be recognized.

87
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,820
-你的努力他都看在眼里  -没事
- He'll see you're working--  - It doesn't matter.

88
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,760
我有你就够了
I have you.

89
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,940
我会成为一个父亲
I'm gonna be a father.

90
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,260
我会出人头地
I'll make my way.

91
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,180
我知道这一切的意义何在
I know what I'm doing it for.

92
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,040
火机们 泥们嚎啊
How-de-do,fellas?

93
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,800
抽颗雪家吧
Have yourselves a "see-gar."

00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,830
我不喜欢烟
I don't like cigarettes.

95
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,850

Pissy little girlie smokes.

96
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,550
烟 水果酒
Cigarettes. Drinks with fruit.

97
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,100
手提包 熏衣草香皂之类乱七八糟的东西
Darling handbags. Lavender soap.All that cunty shit.

98
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,300
说说你的名字吧
Why don't you tell me your name?

99
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,710
弗朗西斯 X 布什曼
Francis X. Bushman.

100
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,380
-真的吗  -当然
-Really? -Absolutely.

101
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,540
X代表什么
What's the X stand for?

102
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,860
代表世间万物
The X will stand for pretty much anything.

弗朗西斯 X

104
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,030
弗朗西斯 X. 你来自哪里
Francis X.,where you from?

105
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,480
你觉得呢
Where do you think I'm from?

106
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,080
俄亥俄州和加州
what's that state between,uh,

107
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,440
中间的州是什么
Ohio and California?

108
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,190
遗忘之州
The state of oblivion.

109
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,880
你他妈是在耍我吗 弗朗西斯 X
You fucking with me,Francis X.?

110
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,760
-不是  -我不喜欢被耍
-No. -I don't like to be fucked with.

111
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,850
我没耍你
I'm not fucking with you.

112
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,320
那我刚才说的那个州叫什么

-是吗  -被你看穿了

115
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,880
我很会看人的性格
I'm a good judge of character.

116
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,260
问问我两个前夫就知道了
Just ask my first two husbands.

117
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,420
他们不知道自己错过了(还有丢了的意思)什么
They didn't know what they were missing.

118
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,030
我带走了大约有800美元和一些玻璃首饰
About 800 bucks and some paste jewelry by the time I was done.

119

你结婚了 但是你妻子很久不和你上床了
You're married,but your wife hasn't sucked your cock since Harding bought the farm.

125
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,200

You used to run around with your asshole pals,

126
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,750
周六晚上总是热血沸腾

127
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,870
在一个妓院门口排队

come quick,and lie about it after.

129
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:33,800
但是你现在想的是和你秘书上床
But now you're mostly thinking about fucking your secretary,

130
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,720
从老板那里偷一船货
stealing a boatload off your boss,

131
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,820
然后就纠结是站在有轨电车电车前被撞死痛还是
and whether or not it would hurt more to stand in front of a trolley

132
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,340
一枪打在脑袋上痛
or shoot yourself in the head.

133
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,340
还有 你很爱你的孩子
Oh--and you love your children.

134
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,450
我说得怎么样
How'd I do?

135
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,390
我卖的是地板蜡
I sell floor polish.

136
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,110
你可怜的小混蛋
Oh,you poor,sad fuck.

137
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,790
你到底在这里做什么
What the hell are you doing here?

138
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,360
希望能找点乐子
Looking for a good time.

139
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,200
你知道这是什么地方吗
You know what kind of place this is?

140
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:14,280
在这里 根本就
This is where hope comes

141
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,870
没有希望
to get fucked in the ass.

142
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,460
希望什么时候来
When's she showing up?

143
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,340
我们要是现在跑
If we run now,

144
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,420
安吉洛怎么会知道
how's D'Angelo gonna know?

145
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,540
跑去哪 怎么跑
Run where? With what?

146
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,760
进去房间 扔下钱
Get into the count room,drop off the money.

147
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,180
放下包 不要打开
Leave the satchel,don't open it.

148
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,250
我走出去 开始和他们聊天
I step out,start a conversation--

149
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,650
"谁看了小熊队的比赛吗"
"Anybody catch that Cubs game?"

150
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,920
我再带着钥匙回去 清空包 打开保险柜
I double back with the key,empty the satchel,open the safe.

151
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,470
我们没好好考虑清楚
This has not been thought through.

152
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,190
该死
Fuck.

153
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:01,190
我之前说过的 关于你妻子的话
What I said before,about your spouse,

154
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,400
是个意外...
you know,being an accident...

155
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,880
我没想说得那么可怕
I didn't mean it in a sense of something horrible.

156
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,760
叽叽咕咕什么呢
What's all the whispering?

157
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,370
-送货  -早上再来
-Drop-off. -Come back in the morning.

158
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,480
已经晚到一天了 我们想现在进去
It's already a day late. We want to get it in now.

159
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,040
给我 
Give it to me.

160
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,220
我们必须确定货到了
We need to be sure it's added.

161
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,710
不是针对你
Nothing personal.

162
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,510
好吧 进来 快点
All right. Come on,hurry up.

163
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,510
等一下 等一下 我没有钥匙
Wait,wait,wait. I don't have the key.

164
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,090
知道钥匙在哪吗
You know where the key is?

165
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,580
在老大桌子上吗
Big Boy's desk?

166
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,530
去拿
Go get it.

167
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,240
没人敢动他桌子
No one touches the desk.

168
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,540
-除非他在这里  -他现在不在
-Unless he's here. -He's not here now.

169
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,520
我们真的需要放下这个
We really need to drop this off.

170
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,680
你干什么
Hey,whoa,whoa,whoa. What are you doing?

171
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,900
-试试能不能打开  -不能这么做
-Trying the knob. -Can't do that.

172
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,410
要是能打开 门就开了 是吧
If it's open,it's open,right?

173
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:01,600
我们...
We,uh...

174
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,310
你别动
Don't you fucking move!

175
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,300
你们鬼鬼祟祟干什么
What are you creeping around for?

176
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,170
-来送货  -那房间关着门
-A drop-off. -The room is closed.

177
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,470
-没上锁 所以  -里面有人占用了
-It was unlocked,so---It was occupied!

178
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,720
很明确里面有人占用了
It was as occupied as a room can get!

179
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,100
-我们来晚了  -晚了一点而已
-We were late. -Just a little late.

180
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,600
-上次我们迟到挨骂了  -给我
-Last time there was some concern. -Give that to me.

181
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,320
理论上 应该交到...
Uh,technically that's supposed to go in the,uh...

182
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,110
只要是交到了拉尔夫手里
Well,as long as it's in Ralph's hands,

183
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,580
我想没问题....
I guess it's okay to--

184
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,910
你们想耍什么花招
What the fuck are you trying to pull?

185
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,950
我们想耍什么花招
What are we trying to pull?

186
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:57,100
拉尔夫 你想我们去找他们的老大吗
Ralph,you want us to track down the Big Boy?

187
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,440
去找迈克 安吉洛
Go find Mike D'Angelo.

188
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,360
让我带她走吧 就让我带她走吧
Let me take her out of here. Just let me do that.

189
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,090
好让你又溜走吗
So you can book off again?

190
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,170
你没有来找我
You didn't come for me.

191
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,280
难道你有想到我吗
You the honeypot, though,ain't you?

192
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,420
你不能让她趟这浑水 你不是这样的人
You can't want her part of this. It's not what you are.

193
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,040
不根本不了解我
You don't know me, do you?

194
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,650
我知道你不会收手
I know you wouldn't stop.

195
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,000
我知道我必须离开 否则永远无法自由
I know I had to leave or never be free.

196
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,650
现在你自由了吗
You free now?

197
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,970
七年来 每天晚上我闭起双眼
Seven years I close my eyes at night.

198
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,730
耳边总萦绕着你的声音
Only thing got me to sleep was your voice in my head.

199
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:00,780
然后我才发现 我已经不记得你的声音了
Then I realized I didn't even remember what you sound like.

200
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,240
于是我幻想你的声音
Just made you up.

201
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,660
告诉我发生了什么事
Tell me what happened.

202
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,530
求求你
Please?

203
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,240
我们这是在哪
Where are we?

204
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,720
宝贝 我们在纽约
we're in New York, precious.

205
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,390
正如我跟你说的
Like I said we'd be.

206
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,030
我睡着了
I fell asleep.

207
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,940
是的
Yes,you did.

208
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,110
我能吃点什么吗
Can I have something to eat?

209
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,680
等我们完事后 马上给你吃的
As soon as we finish here.

210
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,140
要等多久
How soon is that?

211
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,760
不用多久
Not long.

212
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,850
对吗
Will it be?

213
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,320
你来自哪里 小不点
Where you hail from, little one?

214
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,850
没事的 你可以告诉他
It's okay. You can tell him.

215
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,140
我在俄克拉荷马州出生
I was born in Oklahoma.

216
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,940
但我们去过很多地方
But we've been all over.

217
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,560
因为你妈妈要登台唱歌吗
When your mama sing?

218
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,430
她不会唱歌
She doesn't sing.

219
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,870
那她都干什么
Then what she do?

220
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,130
替安格鲁先生工作
Work for Mr. Engler.

221
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,090
是吗 那是谁
Yeah? Who that?

222
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,940
他是一个在孟菲斯市的白人
He's a white man in Memphis.

223
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,240
她都替他做什么工作
What she do for him?

224
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,960
我帮他清洁厕所
I keep his toilets clean.

225
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,640
我求求你
I'm begging you.

226
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,800
你能让我进去吗
Will you let me in?

227
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,390
如果我不能见你 又怎么好好谈
We can't talk if I'm not able to see you.

228
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,890
你大老远跑来 不是为了玩这蠢游戏吧
It's a long way to travel for foolish games.

229
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,530
让他进来
Let him in.

230
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,300
去啊
Go on.

231
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,190
好的
Okay.

232
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,270
去那边坐好 别说话
Go sit over there and be quiet.

233
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,960
去那边坐好
Go sit over there.

234
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,250
我懂了
I see.

235
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,960
你叫什么
What's your name?

236
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,970
我叫奥尔西娅
My name's Althea.

237
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,630
真好听
That's pretty.

238
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,700
知道这名字什么意思吗
Do you know what it means?

239
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,610
在古希腊语中 是"治愈"的意思
It means "healing" in ancient Greek.

240
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,670
我叫瓦伦丁

241
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,420
至于这人 你认识吗
And this man, do you know him?

242
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,440
她们与我们的事无关
They ain't a part of this.

243
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,210
看来 我们都有各自的私事要处理
Well,I suppose we all have our affairs to discuss.

244
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,340
你过得如何 格拉斯先生
How are you keeping, Mr. Glass?

245
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,710
看看这大海
Look at the ocean.

246
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,060
大海怎么了
What about it?

247
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:52,220
这颜色 在捕鱼季来临前两周呈这颜色
That color--two weeks before the season starts?

248
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,650
凶兆
Bad sign.

249
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,040
我觉得挺好的
Looks all right to me.

250
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,630
证明会有飓风
That's hurricane water.

251
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,260
-时间尚早吧  -这说明夏季会有不祥之兆
-Kind of early for that. - Bad sign for the summer.

252
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,320
我们只能祈求上天保佑
Let's hope for the best.

253
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,960
站着说话不腰疼
That's easy for you to say.

254
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:10,660
这三个半月可是我这一年的生计来源
I have three and a half months to make my living out here.

255
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,870
如果不能扭亏为盈 那我就惨了
If I don't turn a profit now, I don't turn one.

256
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,340
惨死了
At all.

257
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,920
即使这样 你们这些人也总是准时出现
But that never stops the lot of you showing up like clockwork.

258
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,840
不是吗
Does it?

259
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,000
何出此言
How's that?

260
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,990
琳赛去哪了
Where's Lindsay anyway?

261
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:28,830
警长今天很忙 所以...
Sheriff's got his hands full today,so...

262

有一个问题
There's a problem.

263
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,620
-什么问题  -这里有不少小偷
-Yes,sir? -Little thief running around.

264
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,230
你们得想办法
You need to get on it.

265
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,200
-什么  -狡猾的小淘气
-What? -Sneaky little monkey.

266
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,550
跟着顾客进来
Comes in right behind the customers.

267
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,830
一不留神 整盒伍长烟就不见了
Before you know it, makes off with a box of Caporals.

268
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,220
已经发生两次了
Twice now.

269
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,630
他有什么特征
Can you describe him?

270
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,640
10岁 11岁吧
10,11.

271
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,850
戴平顶帽 脏兮兮的家伙
Flat cap. Dirty little monkey.

272
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,800
行 我们会留意的
Well,we'll keep an eye out.

273
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,500
我为什么要付你钱
I'm giving you this why?

274
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,410
我誓要将那小贼逮捕归案 格拉斯先生
I vow to bring that rascal to justice, Mr. Glass.

275
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,820

-He's gonna blow it. -You can see it in his eyes.

好啊 今天是个散步的好日子
Yes,it's a grand day to stroll the boardwalk.

424
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,679
但我们还有比海水沙滩更值得一看的
But we got more to see than water and sand.

425
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,700
只要五美分就能看到大西洋城最有特色的...
Just one nickel pays admission to Atlantic City's very own...

426
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,169
-你能说句话吗  -不好办
-Could you put a word in? -It's tricky.

427
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:16,219
我没想找什么 只是公寓里的一件东西
I'm not looking for much. Just something in the department.

428
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,409
时机不到
It needs to be the right time.

429
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:19,279
吉姆 内亚力会提名担任市议员

430
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,639
你想像吉姆 内亚力那样吗
You want to be like Jim Neary?

431
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,669
一个毫无诚信可言的家伙
Man doesn't have an honest bone in his body.

432
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,099
你花钱去吃那顿饭
You paid money to go to that dinner.

433
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,800
这两者有什么关系
What's that got to do with it?

434
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,880
下次你看到海军准将...
Next time you see the Commodore...

435
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,229
我会处理的
I'll handle it.

436
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,759
也许就在一个消防站了...

437
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,390
伊莱 你得相信我 好吗

-纳吉  -怎么了
-Hey,Nuck. - What?

440
00:29:46,707 --> 00:29:48,922
上周六

441
00:29:48,956 --> 00:29:51,995
朱恩和她的父母与我一同乘坐双桅帆船
I went with June and her parents up to Brigantine.

442
00:29:52,027 --> 00:29:54,483
我们沿着海滨散步的时候
We're all walking along the shore

443
00:29:54,531 --> 00:29:58,915
她突然说 "我的发带丢了

444
00:29:58,946 --> 00:30:00,642
你帮我找找"
Help me find it."

-We wind up behind the grass. -Caporals! Caporals!

446
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:07,931
-她让我把手放在她的发梢  -一卷一便士 伍长烟草
-And she lets me put my hand right there. -A penny apiece. Caporals.

447
00:30:07,959 --> 00:30:11,226
-先生 要烟草吗  -我不敢相信
-Hey,mister,cigarette?  - I couldn't believe it.

448
00:30:11,258 --> 00:30:13,931
你会听到 他们所有人都在谈论别人
You could hear them all talking on the other--

449
00:30:13,971 --> 00:30:16,363
发生了什么事
What's going on?

450
00:30:16,386 --> 00:30:18,227
站住
Hey!

451
00:30:20,883 --> 00:30:22,083
站住
Hey!

452

爆米花 花生 还有小孩子的奖品
Popcorn,peanuts, and a prize for the kiddies!

455
00:30:38,893 --> 00:30:42,612
只需五美分 您就可以尝尽美味
One little nickel gets you a lot of deliciousness!

456
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,109
就在这里 来拿您的椒盐脆饼干...
Right here, get your pretzels...

457
00:31:15,089 --> 00:31:18,321
这样真的让我很受伤
This really hurts my feelings.

458
00:31:19,233 --> 00:31:23,537
我对你们做过什么啊
I mean,what'd I ever do to you,huh?

459
00:31:23,664 --> 00:31:26,673
我总是支持鼓励你们
Except give you a leg up?

460

我接纳了你

463

你做了
You did.

464
00:31:36,347 --> 00:31:37,979
你可曾对我说过 谢谢
You ever say thank you? 

465
00:31:38,004 --> 00:31:39,603
我还没听你说过呢

非常...感谢
Thank you very much.

467
00:31:42,289 --> 00:31:45,384

00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:21,840
说实话吧
True,now.

564
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,270
我要打开它
I need to open it.

565
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,880
音乐室是我付的钱
I paid for the studio,

566
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,650
音乐 还有出版
the musicians, the pressing.

567
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,980
但谁也不愿意播
No one will play it.

568
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,750
不愿意聘请我
No one will hire me.

569
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:11,190
芝加哥是这样 堪萨斯城也是
Not in Chicago. Not in Kansas City.

570
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,810
-谁也不愿意雇用我  -这与我何干
-Not anywhere. -What have I to do with that?

571
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,260
你让他们别再阻挡我
You stopped them to stop me.

572
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:19,440
是让我联系那些低级舞场和小酒店吗
My reach extends to every honky-tonk and barrelhouse?

573
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:22,040
我不能再像这样地活着 不能让她受苦
I can't live that way. Not with her.

574
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,730
把她送人 换了别人就会这样
Give her up. Others do.

575
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,670
你这是要逼死我
You are drowning me.

576
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,960
一步步把我逼死
Drop by drop.

577
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,720
也许是你自身原因导致失败
Perhaps the failing is your own.

578
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:42,710
你就是不愿意放过我吗
Won't you let me go?

579
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,930
我刚在城里开会 就赶来...
I came here from a meeting downtown--

580
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,120
应该说 我是被召来的
more truthful to say I was summoned--

581
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:55,120
卢西亚诺先生让我来的
with a Mr. Luciano.

582
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,450
我记得他
I remember him.

583
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,850
他让我复述条件
I am being dictated terms.

584
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:07,170
他会允许我继续做生意
I will be allowed to conduct my business,

585
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:09,300
但必须由他掌权
but only under his control.

586
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:13,960
以此作为交换 他就保护我不受他们这类人的骚扰
In exchange, I will be protected from others of his kind.

587
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,190
他允许我
He will allow me

588
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:20,010
在我的地盘做生意
to conduct my business in my home.

589
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,920
这可真是闻所未闻
This is the new order of things.

590
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,650
-与我无关  -如果有关呢
-Ain't no concern of mine. -What if it were?

591
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:28,970
难道我比那些背叛你的恶魔更甚吗
And am I worse than those devils who betrayed you?

592
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:31,180
我只知道你是恶魔
You the only devil I know.

593
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:33,540
随便你怎么说 但我从没认为自己是你的朋友
Call me what you will. I never claimed to be your friend.

594
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,850
你可以当我的手下
I'll make a place for you.

595
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,740
我会给你好价钱
I'll pay you well.

596
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:39,880
但如果你要复仇
If it's blood you want,

597
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,890
那你就白白浪费了这个好机会
you'll have your chance to spill it.

598
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,100
要我帮你
Me help you?

599
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,830
是你帮自己
You help yourself.

600
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,190
这房间里的所有人都想得到自由
Every soul in this room yearns to be free.

601
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,900
播唱片
Put the record on.

602
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:02,690
我这是在给你机会 你不会得到更好的机会
I'm making you an offer. You'll not get a better one.

603
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,100
播吧
Put it on.

604
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,320
我接受
I'll take the bargain.

605
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:28,160
不
No.

606
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:29,940
这与我无关
Don't really matter to me.

607
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,750
这不是我的来意
It's not what I came for.

608
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:36,310
你是来说出自己的想法 我已经听见了
You came to be heard. That's your voice.

609
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,730
你准备妥当 我以后就听你的
You set it up and I belong to you.

610
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:43,980
你选个城市 我打一通电话
Pick the city. I'll make the call.

611
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:45,640
你明天就要上班
You'll be booked tomorrow.

612
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:01,300
你生存的目的不是为了当白人的佣人
You weren't put on this earth to be no ofay's maid.

613
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,670
你不能相信他
You can't trust him.

614
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,640
你还不明白吗
Don't you know that?

615
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:12,300
我觉得能 有限度的相信吧
I say I can. Far as I need to.

616
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,980
你见过你爸爸吗
You ever meet your daddy?

617
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:40,500
妈妈很爱他 但她非走不可
Mama loved him, but she had to leave.

618
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,540
宝贝
Baby girl...

619
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:57,840
你千万别离开自己的妈妈 听到了吗
you stay real close to your mama now,you hear?

620
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:00,870
别让她靠近像我这样的男人
Keep her away from men like me.

621
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,560
我们说正事吧
Let's get to business.

622
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:13,510
给我你的枪 来证明你对我的忠诚
I'll need the gun. As a gesture of loyalty.

623
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,330
她们先走了
They leave first.

624
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,800
我们可以一起走
We'll all go together.

625
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:42,100
这是为了什么呢
What sense that make?

626
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:46,940
我们的路已经各不相同
We headed in different places.

627
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:51,190
去吧
Go on,now.

628
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:01,490
需要帮忙吗 女士
Help with that, ma'am?

629
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,360
你当然需要
Yes,of course you do.

630
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:00,670
我们的合作正式开始
Our collaboration begins.

Pop wants to see you.

632
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:12,760
为什么 他等钱用吗
Why,does he need money?

633
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:15,690
-不是这样的  -那是为什么
-It's not like that. -Then what?

634
00:47:17,135 --> 00:47:19,629
他只有两个儿子
He's only got two sons.

635
00:47:19,694 --> 00:47:22,509
我能见到妈妈 这才是最重要的
I see Ma, that's what matters.

636
00:47:22,939 --> 00:47:25,190

叫他去死
Fuck him.

00:47:28,635 --> 00:47:30,687

站住
Hold on there.

643
00:48:00,164 --> 00:48:02,199

这个世界都成什么样了
what kind of world would it be?

与我关系亲密的一个人

把车开过来

709
00:53:45,618 --> 00:53:48,380
你不去阻止他们吗 那些白人
You ain't never gonna stop them white boys.

710
00:53:48,896 --> 00:53:51,161
为什么这么说
Why do you say that?

711
00:53:51,241 --> 00:53:54,200

我不知道
I won't.

718
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:20,225
那你就认为 我也会遵守吧
Then tell yourself I will.

719

一切的开始都是一场梦
All a dream to begin with.

720

没有人是生而自由的
Ain't nobody ever been free.

721
00:54:58,286 --> 00:55:00,797
那好吧
All right,then.
