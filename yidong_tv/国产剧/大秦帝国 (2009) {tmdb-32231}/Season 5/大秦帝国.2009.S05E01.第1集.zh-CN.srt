霍斯 我九岁时 爸爸对我说
Well, Hoss, I wasn't but nine and Pappy say,

334

"米尔顿 知道这是什么吗
"Milton, you know what that is?

335
00:24:05,357 --> 00:24:07,266
这是头倒着的驴

336
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:10,338
这头驴总是反着来做事情"

Grab hold of that bushy tail, yell, "Geeyup!"

340
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:26,180

Whoo, and that mule tossed me like a baseball on Sunday.

341

在那之前根本没有好喝的酒

436
00:34:00,683 --> 00:34:02,817
但现在 一想到古巴

现在是不行 但局势要变了

他把我们当傻子糊弄

那是我的事
Just leave that to me.

511
00:38:20,436 --> 00:38:22,741
你不知道 也就不受牵连

516
00:38:58,184 --> 00:38:59,504
你要去哪吗
Where you got to go?

517
00:38:59,776 --> 00:39:02,781
撒泡尿 喝了五杯了
The head. Five espresso.

518
00:39:03,321 --> 00:39:05,194
想干什么就去吧
Do what you need to.

519
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,700

男人总要时不时地出去一趟
A man needs to get out of town every now and then.

527
00:40:45,879 --> 00:40:48,121
这只是个冠冕堂皇的理由
That's just the glory of the whole proposition.

528
00:40:48,418 --> 00:40:50,217
布鲁克林也有海滩的

542
00:41:17,739 --> 00:41:19,721
要听治安官的话 孩子

先说明白
Let's get something straight.

568
00:43:08,346 --> 00:43:09,932
我不是你的手下
