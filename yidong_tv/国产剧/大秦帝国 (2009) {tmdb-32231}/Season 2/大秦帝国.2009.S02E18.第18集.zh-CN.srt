00:01:28,982 --> 00:01:31,919

# Arranges #

35
00:01:31,952 --> 00:01:35,589

# As time passes on #

36
00:01:35,622 --> 00:01:38,526

# And changes #

37
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:43,732

# The hourglass moves on a grain #

38
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:50,705

00:02:09,257 --> 00:02:11,059
不过你们得另外再找人来合唱了
Y'all got to find somebody else to sing it with you though,

50
00:02:11,091 --> 00:02:12,126
因为我不会表演的
'cause I'm not gonna perform.

51
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,595
不 不 你要表演 贾马尔
No. Yes, you are, Jamal.

52
00:02:13,627 --> 00:02:15,295
你这样讲只是因为你现在太累了
You just saying that 'cause you're tired right now.

53
00:02:15,328 --> 00:02:17,731
听着 你父亲为了你把他的健身房改成了复健室
Look, your father turned his gym into a rehab just for you.

54
00:02:17,764 --> 00:02:19,066
不 我真正做的是
No, what I actually did,

55
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,734
给你找到了最好的理疗师
I got the top physical therapist,

56
00:02:20,768 --> 00:02:23,104
就是那个把佩顿・曼宁从他脖颈旧伤中
the same dude that put Peyton Manning together

57
00:02:23,137 --> 00:02:25,006
拯救出来的家伙
after that big old neck injury of his.

58
00:02:25,038 --> 00:02:26,140
他说过他能让你
He said he's gonna have you

59
00:02:26,174 --> 00:02:27,642
在几周内重回巅峰 儿子
in tip-top shape in a couple weeks, son.

60
00:02:27,674 --> 00:02:28,910

61
00:02:28,942 --> 00:02:31,078

62
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:32,447
是的 我们非常希望
Yes, we would love that.

63
00:02:33,881 --> 00:02:35,583
德雷甚至受戒了 这样他就能主持婚礼仪式
Look, Dre even got ordained so he can do the ceremony.

64
00:02:37,317 --> 00:02:39,654
他来主持我们的婚礼 马尔
He gonna marry us, Mal.

65
00:02:39,686 --> 00:02:42,256
所以我希望我的两个兄弟都在场
So I want both of my brothers to be there.

66
00:02:42,289 --> 00:02:44,191
就是这样
Period.

67
00:02:44,225 --> 00:02:47,428
也许我们应该让他一个人静一会儿 让他休息休息
Maybe we should leave him alone, let him get some rest.

68
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,797
如果你感觉不好的话 我们甚至能推迟婚礼
Look, we can even postpone it if you're not feeling...

69
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:51,132
我不会再唱歌了 好吗
I ain't singing no more, all right?

70
00:02:55,335 --> 00:02:57,304
很抱歉 各位 我只是 我只是太累了
I'm sorry, man. I'm just... I'm just tired.

71
00:02:59,072 --> 00:03:01,642
你们没有感觉到疲惫吗
Ain't y'all tired?

72
00:03:03,477 --> 00:03:05,813
一直是相同的循环
The same damn cycle all the time.

73
00:03:08,382 --> 00:03:10,384
总是死亡和监禁循环往复
Just death and incarceration.

74
00:03:13,554 --> 00:03:15,524
我们本能够改变这个循环
We could change that cycle.

75
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:21,795
在我们做到这点之前 我不会再唱歌
I ain't singing again until we do.

76
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:23,864
不要这样 孩子 你在说些什么啊
Come on, man. What are you talking about?

77
00:03:23,898 --> 00:03:26,033
你难道没意识到如果不是你的话
Don't you realize if it hadn't been for you,

78
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:27,835
我都活不到现在 孩子
I might not even be here, man.

79
00:03:27,868 --> 00:03:29,503
你不用因为这个而感谢我 爸
You ain't got to thank me for that, Dad.

80
00:03:29,537 --> 00:03:32,307
不 不 我的意思是 你替我挡了一枪 宝贝
No, no. I mean... I mean, you took a bullet for me, baby.

81
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,841
这是我永远不会忘记的
That's something I will never forget.

82
00:03:33,874 --> 00:03:35,842
那弗雷达呢
How's Freda?

83
00:03:38,044 --> 00:03:40,180
你是说那个想要杀了我的姑娘
You mean the girl that tried to shoot me?

84
00:03:40,214 --> 00:03:42,883
她也是其中的受害者 她也是 她也是受害者
She's a victim in this. She is. She's a victim, too.

-你在说什么呀 奶奶 -好了

92
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,613
贾马尔脾气不好是因为他累了
Jamal is grumpy because he's tired.

93
00:04:12,646 --> 00:04:14,348
他以前可没被枪射中过
He ain't never been shot before.

94
00:04:14,382 --> 00:04:16,884
所以我要把他带回他房间了
So I'm gonna take him to his room.

95
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,752
你之前说过我们的爷爷是个警察
You said our grandfather was a cop.

96
00:04:18,786 --> 00:04:21,555
我爸确实是个警察
My daddy was a cop.

97
00:04:24,557 --> 00:04:26,694
好了
Okay.

到你睡午觉的时间了
It's time for you to take your nap.

99
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,632
胡安妮塔会给你一小杯可口的白兰地

你要是再继续捏我的胳膊
You keep squeezing my arm,

106
00:04:43,743 --> 00:04:46,580
我就用脚狠狠踢你的嘴

我很担心他
I'm worried about him.

114

我是说 不是因为
I mean, and it's not because

115
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:11,748
他不愿做理疗
he doesn't want to do physical therapy.

116
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,849
-而是他看起来很消颓 卢修斯 -是啊

医生说他可以行走了 但是

118
00:05:17,387 --> 00:05:18,922
他不想再做音乐

是塔里克 我早跟你说了

我强烈要求离开
I absolutely demanded to be allowed to leave.

133

是的 但是现在 显然
Yeah, but now, of course,

他们问了你什么样的问题

他们问了很多问题
They were asking a lot.

139
00:06:01,664 --> 00:06:02,731
我一个也没回答
I didn't answer any of them.

140
00:06:02,765 --> 00:06:04,234
姑娘 你总该记得点什么吧

142
00:06:05,602 --> 00:06:08,304
一个叫肖恩・约翰逊的人的事情 肖恩
a guy named Shyne Johnson, Shyne?

143
00:06:08,337 --> 00:06:09,405
肖恩・约翰逊
Shyne Johnson?

144
00:06:09,438 --> 00:06:10,773
我就说听到了你的声音 你个恶毒的婊子
I knew I heard your voice, you evil bitch!

145
00:06:11,808 --> 00:06:13,277
停下 停下
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

146
00:06:18,515 --> 00:06:19,582
噢我的天呐
Oh, my God!

147
00:06:19,616 --> 00:06:21,418
没事了 没事了 没事了 
I got her. I got you. I got you.

148
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,852
-过来 过来 -别碰我 德雷
- Come on, come on. - Get off of me, Dre!

149
00:06:22,885 --> 00:06:24,753
-好了 让我看看 -我的天哪
- It's okay, let me see. - Oh, my God.

150
00:06:24,787 --> 00:06:26,590
你特么到底怎么回事
What in the hell is wrong with you?!

151
00:06:26,623 --> 00:06:28,592
-我知道是你推了我 婊子 -什么
- I know you pushed me, bitch! - What?!

152
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,327
别碰我 
Get off of me! Ow!

153
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:32,127
-冷静 -别碰我
- Calm down. - Get off of me!

154
00:06:32,161 --> 00:06:34,097
不 这指控可没道理啊
No, that's a wild accusation to make!

155
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,599
我下楼的时候摔下来昏迷了
I passed out on the way down,

156
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:37,766
等我醒来的时候 看到了你的鞋
and then I woke up and I saw your shoes.

157
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:38,934
那双你特别喜欢的
The bottom of those

158
00:06:38,967 --> 00:06:40,337
红色鲁布托高跟鞋
red Louboutins you love so much.

159
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:41,871
-我的天哪 她疯了 -等等 不 不
- Oh, my God, she's crazy! - Wait, no, no, no.

160
00:06:41,904 --> 00:06:43,840
朗达 很多女人都穿这种鞋啊
Rhonda, a whole lot of women rock them shoes.

161
00:06:43,873 --> 00:06:44,841
我就有一双
I got a pair.

162
00:06:44,873 --> 00:06:46,275
-朗达 -你现在帮她说话了
- Rhonda... - You're on her side now?

163
00:06:46,308 --> 00:06:47,878
我没有帮谁说话 我只是说
I'm on nobody's side, but I'm saying

164
00:06:47,911 --> 00:06:49,513
我没法想象她会做这样的事
I can't see her doing that.

165
00:06:49,546 --> 00:06:50,779
好了 等一下
Okay, wait a minute.

166
00:06:50,813 --> 00:06:52,015
都冷静 朗达
Hold up. So, Rhonda,

167
00:06:52,048 --> 00:06:54,885
你真的认为这个像乡下人进城的的安妮卡
you really think pearl-clutching debutante Anika

168
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:56,385
会把你推下楼梯
pushed you down the steps?

169
00:06:56,419 --> 00:06:57,554
我知道是你做的
I know you did it.

170
00:06:57,587 --> 00:06:59,356
我怎么可能对你做出那样的事 朗达
How could I do something like that to you, Rhonda?

171
00:06:59,388 --> 00:07:00,689
噢 闭嘴吧 婊子
Oh, shut up, bitch!

172
00:07:00,722 --> 00:07:01,657
告诉他们 德雷
Tell 'em, Dre.

173
00:07:01,691 --> 00:07:03,659
告诉他们
Tell 'em.

174
00:07:03,693 --> 00:07:05,329
德雷
Dre?

175
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,465
我们很抱歉
We're sorry.

176
00:07:08,498 --> 00:07:09,466
哇哦
Wow.

177
00:07:09,498 --> 00:07:10,866
-我们很抱歉 爸 -抱歉
- We are sorry, Pop. - Sorry?

178
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,202
我不知道这是发生了什么
I don't know what's going on here.

179
00:07:12,234 --> 00:07:14,136
我们没想在你的办公室
We didn't mean to come into your office...

180
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:15,170
很抱歉
We're sorry?

181
00:07:15,203 --> 00:07:17,373
搞出这样的闹剧 这么丑态百出
...like this, with this type of energy.

182
00:07:17,407 --> 00:07:18,474
我们非常抱歉
We're very sorry.

183
00:07:18,508 --> 00:07:19,508
你太可悲了
You are pathetic!

184
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,378
-很抱歉 -她还好吧
- Sorry about that. - Is she okay?

185
00:07:21,411 --> 00:07:22,679
是的 没事
Yeah, it's okay.

186
00:07:22,712 --> 00:07:24,313
我的天哪 她疯了
Oh, my God, she is crazy!

187
00:07:24,347 --> 00:07:26,716
我绝对不会做这样的事情
I could never do something like that!

188
00:07:26,748 --> 00:07:27,850
好了 帮她清理一下 让她冷静下来
Okay, go clean her up. Calm her down.

189
00:07:27,883 --> 00:07:28,884
没事了 没事了
I got you. I got you.

190
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:30,019
别让她流产
Before she lose the baby.

191
00:07:30,053 --> 00:07:31,855
嘿 还有和她呆在一起 直到我们
Hey, and stay with her till we get her

192
00:07:31,888 --> 00:07:33,155
-给她配好安保 -没问题
- some security. - I'm on it.

193
00:07:33,188 --> 00:07:34,224
她不会被传唤的
She won't be subpoenaed.

194
00:07:34,256 --> 00:07:35,658
既然我没有怀上他的孙子
Now that I'm not carrying his grandchild,

195
00:07:35,691 --> 00:07:37,192
我们就又对他毫无价值了
we are nothing to him again.

196
00:07:37,226 --> 00:07:39,195
然后他会让那婊子逃过这一劫
And he's gonna let her get away with it.

197
00:07:39,227 --> 00:07:40,195
他们不相信你 朗达
They don't believe it, Rhonda.

198
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:41,531
什么
What?

199
00:07:41,563 --> 00:07:42,765
他们不相信你
They don't believe it.

200
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:44,501
我也不相信
And neither do I.

201
00:07:44,534 --> 00:07:46,503
什么
What?

202
00:07:46,536 --> 00:07:47,904
那你的幻觉呢
What about your visions, huh?

203
00:07:47,936 --> 00:07:49,405
那是因为我的病 宝贝
It's part of my illness, baby.

204
00:07:49,438 --> 00:07:50,506
你自己也是这么说的
You said so yourself.

205
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:51,840
好吧 如果现在上帝告诉了你
Well, if God was telling you

206
00:07:51,873 --> 00:07:53,275
有人把我推下楼梯
that somebody pushed me down the stairs,

207
00:07:53,308 --> 00:07:55,744
那我可能就开始信主了
I might have to start actually believing in him.

208
00:07:55,777 --> 00:07:58,515
那你想要我们怎么做
Well, what do you want us to do?

209
00:07:58,548 --> 00:08:02,018
我为了你
What I did for you.

210
00:08:02,051 --> 00:08:03,387
对弗农做的事
With Vernon.

211
00:08:05,054 --> 00:08:07,056
我一点也没犹豫
I didn't hesitate.

212
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,025
那是自我防卫 朗达
It was self-defense, Rhonda.

213
00:08:09,058 --> 00:08:10,360
-我去 -那是自我防范
- Oh, God. - It was self-defense.

214
00:08:10,392 --> 00:08:11,561
得了吧
Come on.

215
00:08:11,594 --> 00:08:13,597
你知道 你的两个兄弟都是音乐家 对吧
You know, your brothers are both musicians, right?

216
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,931
他们这天赋是继承自卢修斯
They got that from Lucious.

217
00:08:14,964 --> 00:08:16,032
但你所继承的
But what you got,

218
00:08:16,064 --> 00:08:17,766
除了他母亲的疾病以外
aside from his mother's illness,

219
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:21,036
就是他的杀手天性
is his killer instinct.

220
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:21,938
安德雷先生
Mr. Andre?

221
00:08:24,741 --> 00:08:25,842
谢谢你 胡安妮塔
Thank you, Juanita.

222
00:08:30,646 --> 00:08:32,616
-你这话不是真心的 -噢 我是真心的
- You don't mean that. - Oh, I do.

223
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:35,284
我绝对是真心的
I definitely mean it.

224
00:08:35,318 --> 00:08:37,621
所以 当你真正变成那个我所嫁的男人
So, when you become the man that I married,

225
00:08:37,654 --> 00:08:39,556
那个愿意去做需要做的事情的男人时
the man who's willing to do what needs to be done...

226
00:08:39,588 --> 00:08:40,823
-嗯 -让他给我打个电话
- Mm. - ...have him give me a call

227
00:08:40,856 --> 00:08:42,058
因为我真的很想他
'cause I really miss him.

228
00:08:42,091 --> 00:08:43,058
好的
Okay.

229
00:08:43,092 --> 00:08:44,595
嗯 是啊 想笑就笑吧
Mm-hmm. Yeah, laugh all you want.

230
00:08:45,962 --> 00:08:49,064
我早跟你说过 塔里克会是个大麻烦
I told your ass Tariq was gonna be a problem.

231
00:08:49,097 --> 00:08:52,901
不 他不会很麻烦
Nah, he ain't the problem.

232
00:08:52,934 --> 00:08:54,938
我们有太多重合的人手
We got too many people in common.

233
00:08:56,972 --> 00:08:58,976
问题是
Problem is...

234
00:09:01,678 --> 00:09:02,946
什么
What?

235
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,653
天
Ugh.

236
00:09:17,693 --> 00:09:20,130
到底是什么 卢修斯
What is it, Lucious?

237
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,601
你知道 在你被关起来之后
You know, after you got locked up,

238
00:09:24,634 --> 00:09:27,003
-我得安排一些暗探 -嗯 是
- I had to put in work on a couple cats. - Mm-hmm. Yeah.

239
00:09:27,035 --> 00:09:28,270
毒贩
Drug dealers.

240
00:09:28,304 --> 00:09:29,972
有三个是想要我们死
The three horsemen who wanted us dead.

241
00:09:30,005 --> 00:09:31,106
我明白
I got it.

242
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,808
是 然后还有第四个人
Yeah, well, there was a fourth horseman.

243
00:09:32,842 --> 00:09:37,212
前三个是为了保护我们的家庭
First three was to protect our family.

244
00:09:37,246 --> 00:09:39,314
但是最后一个 是一份工作
But that last one, that was a job.

245
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,218
那你是在替谁卖命 卢修斯
Who were you working for, Lucious?

246
00:09:42,251 --> 00:09:43,786
你知道我是在为谁卖命
You know who I was working for.

247
00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:45,988
是你让他们听到我的音乐的
You was the one that let them hear my music.

248
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:49,458
汤米・达弗尼和罗西・珀金斯
Tommy Davoni and Rosey Perkins?

249
00:09:49,491 --> 00:09:50,959
就是他们
Exactly.

250
00:09:50,992 --> 00:09:53,195
他们想要一个新歌手打破销售记录
They were cutting a record with this new artist

251
00:09:53,228 --> 00:09:55,898
然而这个歌手却不是善茬
that turned out to be a real loudmouth.

252
00:09:55,932 --> 00:09:57,033
倒卖黄牛票
Selling wolf tickets,

253
00:09:57,065 --> 00:09:58,367
威胁别的歌手
threatening all the other artists,

254
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,703
所以他们就想要做掉他
and so they wanted him handled.

255
00:10:00,736 --> 00:10:04,039
而肖恩和我被挑中做这份工作
And Shyne and me got the memo.

256
00:10:04,073 --> 00:10:07,510
你知道联邦探员不会轻易放过这件事的 对吧
You do realize the Feds aren't gonna let this go, right?

257
00:10:09,411 --> 00:10:10,713
还有谁知道
Who else knows?

258
00:10:10,746 --> 00:10:12,716
你 我 汤米和罗西
You, me and Tommy and Rosey.

259
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,984
但是他们两个
But the both of them,

260
00:10:15,016 --> 00:10:16,919
都会来哈基姆的婚礼
they coming to Hakeem's wedding, you know.

261
00:10:16,953 --> 00:10:18,722
我们还暂且没事
We still tight.

262
00:10:18,755 --> 00:10:20,724
他们现在也开始洗白了 所以事情败露一样吃不了兜着走
And they're legit now, so they got just as much to lose.

263
00:10:20,756 --> 00:10:24,359
好的 好的 这也是联邦探员围着肖恩调查的原因吧
Right, right. And that's why the Feds are all over Shyne.

264
00:10:24,393 --> 00:10:27,997
是 但是肖恩 他是个愚蠢的恶棍 你知道吧
Yeah, but Shyne... he's a idiot thug, you know.

265
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:29,399
他可不会告密
He ain't no snitch.

266
00:10:29,432 --> 00:10:31,601
只有死人才能知道我们的过去
Know our past got to stay buried.

267
00:10:31,634 --> 00:10:32,769
嗯
Mm-hmm.

268
00:10:32,802 --> 00:10:34,538
不能让别人知道这些事情
No one can know about this.

269
00:10:42,268 --> 00:10:44,272

# I got broads in Atlanta #

270
00:10:44,305 --> 00:10:46,007

# Twistin' dope, lean, and the Fanta #

271
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,608

# Credit cards and the scammers #

272
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:49,210

# Hittin' off licks in the bando #

273
00:10:49,243 --> 00:10:50,243

# Black X6, Phantom... #

274
00:10:50,277 --> 00:10:52,379
这是肖恩的地方吧
Is this Shyne's spot?

275
00:10:52,412 --> 00:10:54,214

# Going out like I'm Montana #

276
00:10:54,248 --> 00:10:55,883

# Hundred killers, hundred hammers #

277
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,517

# Black X6, Phantom #

278
00:10:57,551 --> 00:10:59,219

# White X6, Panda... #

279
00:10:59,253 --> 00:11:00,955
就拐个弯帮我买点多兹乐糖
How long's it take to go around the corner

280
00:11:00,988 --> 00:11:02,356
能花多长时间啊

281
00:11:02,388 --> 00:11:05,926
我半个小时之前让他出去 他怎么到现在都还没回来
I sent him out 30 minutes ago, and he still ain't back.

282
00:11:07,761 --> 00:11:09,262
要是他一分钟后还不回
If he not here in the next minute,

283
00:11:09,296 --> 00:11:11,032
我就把他也装在箱子里
I'm gonna put his ass in a box, too.

284
00:11:11,065 --> 00:11:12,767
让他给我买的是多兹乐糖
Told him to go get Twizzlers,

285
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,868
不是他妈的圣杯
not the damn Holy Grail!

286
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:16,036
嘿 肖恩
Hey, Shyne.

287
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,405
最好是我的多兹乐到了
That better be my Twizzlers.

288
00:11:17,437 --> 00:11:19,740
你和琦琦・里昂有约吗 她上楼来了
You expecting Cookie Lyon? She on her way up.

289
00:11:20,773 --> 00:11:22,375
她来晚了
She late.

让她进来
Let her in.

# Panda. #

00:11:42,796 --> 00:11:45,398
听着
Look.

302
00:11:45,431 --> 00:11:48,134
我想说的是 一旦你们其中一个倒下
All I'm saying is if one of y'all goes down,

303
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:49,737
其他所有人也得倒
all of y'all go down.

304
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,202
所以你们不觉得互相帮助才是明智的吗
So don't you think it'd be smart if y'all had each other's backs?

305
00:11:52,273 --> 00:11:54,910
卢修斯把我踢出局
Lucious cut me out.

306
00:11:54,944 --> 00:11:56,512
他发的唱片欠我一份酬劳
He owe me profits on his record.

307
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,247
肖恩 你自己也清楚
Shyne, you know damn well

308
00:11:59,281 --> 00:12:00,816
那张唱片跟你半毛钱关系没有
you ain't have nothing to do with that record.

309
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:03,169
好吧 听着
Okay, look.

310
00:12:03,585 --> 00:12:05,654
你想要多少钱
How much is it gonna take to make this right?

311
00:12:05,688 --> 00:12:07,490
我不想要他的钱
I don't want his money.

312
00:12:07,522 --> 00:12:08,807
嗯 那你想要什么呢 肖恩
Well, what do you want, Shyne?

313
00:12:08,925 --> 00:12:11,095
我想帮我的侄子乔伊争取到一份出版协议
I want a publishing deal for my nephew Joey.

314
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:13,398
这孩子很有天赋
This kid hella talented.

315
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,898
他在这里没机会出人头地
He can't catch a break out here.

316
00:12:14,932 --> 00:12:16,801
嗯 对此我很遗憾
Mm, sorry to hear that.

317
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,335
-对不起 -听听这个
- Sorry... - Check this out.

318
00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:21,740

# And we don't care who we stepping on #

321
00:12:27,645 --> 00:12:29,313

# He better know who you're betting on #

322
00:12:29,347 --> 00:12:30,848

# Make sure your weapon drawn 'cause we shooting... #

323
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:32,950
给 肖恩
Here, Shyne.

324
00:12:32,983 --> 00:12:34,818
这不是多兹乐糖
These ain't Twizzlers!

325
00:12:34,851 --> 00:12:35,919
好了
Okay.

326
00:12:36,953 --> 00:12:37,989
成交
Done.

327
00:12:39,823 --> 00:12:42,126
并且我想要哈基姆来录
And I want Hakeem to record it.

328
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:44,094
没问题
I can make that happen.

329
00:12:44,127 --> 00:12:45,262
而且
And...

330
00:12:45,295 --> 00:12:47,331
我想参加婚礼
I want to come to that wedding.

331
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:50,335
业内的人都被邀请了 除了我
See, everybody in the industry got invited but me.

332
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:53,337
我得说
And I got to say...

333
00:12:53,371 --> 00:12:55,340
我很受伤
my feelings are hurt.

334
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:04,481
回家的感觉很好 对吗
It's good to be home, right?

335
00:13:04,515 --> 00:13:05,784
是啊 当然
Yeah, sure.

336
00:13:05,817 --> 00:13:07,952
我厌倦了当你的护士 兄弟
Yo, I'm tired of being your nurse, bro.

337
00:13:07,985 --> 00:13:10,188
我还有别的事要做 好吗
I got other things to do, okay?

338
00:13:10,221 --> 00:13:11,822
我还有两天就要结婚了
I'm getting married in two days.

339
00:13:11,856 --> 00:13:13,725
好吧 没事 因为首先
All right, that's cool, 'cause first of all,

340
00:13:13,757 --> 00:13:15,492
我不需要你们帮我擦屁股
I don't need y'all to babysit my ass.

341
00:13:15,525 --> 00:13:16,727
你们走吧
So be gone.

342
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,529
-你确定吗 -我确定
- You sure? - I'm certain.

343
00:13:18,563 --> 00:13:20,999
你确定吗 我们可以给你放个电影或者游戏
You sure? We can put a movie on or a game.

344
00:13:21,031 --> 00:13:22,232
我不想看什么游戏
I don't want to watch no damn game.

345
00:13:22,265 --> 00:13:23,467
你们可以退下了 走吧
You're dismissed. Go.

346
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,803
好吧 如果有需要随时打给我
All right, hit me up if you need something.

347
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:26,204
再见 我爱你们
Bye. I love you.

348
00:13:26,236 --> 00:13:27,505
我也爱你 傻子
Love you, too, fool.

349
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:41,652
那么 朗达真的走了吗
So, Rhonda really left?

350
00:13:41,686 --> 00:13:43,354
是的 我们有个大学同学
Yeah, we got a friend from college

351
00:13:43,386 --> 00:13:46,090
刚刚 呃 在洛杉矶开了一家珠宝公司
who's, uh, starting up a jewelry company in L.A.

352
00:13:46,124 --> 00:13:47,659
她过去瞧瞧
She went to check it out.

353
00:13:47,692 --> 00:13:48,860
她会回来的
She'll be back.

354
00:13:48,893 --> 00:13:51,428
是啊 是啊 她当然会回来了
Yeah, yeah. Of course she'll be back.

355
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:52,831
别告诉贾马尔 好吗
And don't tell Jamal, okay?

356
00:13:52,864 --> 00:13:54,999
我不希望再有什么事烦他了
I don't want to give him anything else to brood about.

357
00:13:55,031 --> 00:13:56,266
听着 我很担心他 德雷
Look, I'm worried about him, Dre.

358
00:13:56,299 --> 00:13:57,669
是啊 我也是
Yeah, me, too.

359
00:13:57,702 --> 00:13:59,236
所有人都在努力帮他 你知道吗
And everybody's trying to help him, you know?

360
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,673
我 你 琦琦 贝基
Me, you, Cookie, Becky.

361
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:02,673
所有人 除了
Everybody except...

362
00:14:02,707 --> 00:14:04,676
卢修斯
Lucious.

363
00:14:06,476 --> 00:14:07,746
拜托 伙计
Come on, man.

364
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:08,880
卢修斯什么时候
When's the last time

365
00:14:08,913 --> 00:14:11,216
大发慈悲帮过别人了
Lucious went out of his way to help anybody?

366
00:14:11,249 --> 00:14:13,250
尤其是他自己的儿子
Especially one of his own sons.

367
00:14:21,893 --> 00:14:23,561
你们有十分钟
You got ten minutes.

368
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:35,072
你伤透了我的心你知道吗 弗雷达
You know you broke my heart, Freda.

369
00:14:40,912 --> 00:14:42,714
你为什么要朝我开枪
Why would you try and shoot me?

370
00:14:42,746 --> 00:14:43,914
你知道这是为什么
You know why.

371
00:14:43,947 --> 00:14:45,216
我不知道
I don't know why.

372
00:14:45,249 --> 00:14:46,417
你杀了我父亲
You killed my father.

373
00:14:46,449 --> 00:14:47,751
卡萝尔告诉我的
Carol told me.

374
00:14:47,784 --> 00:14:50,053
你干嘛相信那个瘾君子的话啊
Why would you listen to a crackhead?

375
00:14:50,087 --> 00:14:53,057
听着 我与你父亲最后的谈话 
Look, the last conversation I had with your father

376
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,225
是关于你的
was about you.

377
00:14:54,257 --> 00:14:56,126
不然你认为我为什么
Why do you think I tried to reach out

378
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,395
一开始去找了你
to you in the first place?

379
00:14:57,428 --> 00:14:59,130
因为你感到愧疚
'Cause you felt guilty.

380
00:14:59,163 --> 00:15:01,733
你想想我和你父亲一起长大的情谊
The circumstances under which me and your father grew up,

381
00:15:01,765 --> 00:15:03,735
我会伤害他吗
the violence?

382
00:15:03,768 --> 00:15:07,639
正因如此 当我看到你去探望他时
That's why, when I saw you when you came to visit him,

383
00:15:07,672 --> 00:15:10,508
我看到了你身上的天赋
and I saw this talent in you that...

384
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,309
值得被挖掘的天赋
that was something worth saving.

385
00:15:14,477 --> 00:15:16,113
我向你保证
Promise you,

386
00:15:16,146 --> 00:15:18,248
我从未伤害过你爸爸
I never laid a finger on your daddy.

387
00:15:18,281 --> 00:15:20,517
但这件事已经与他无关了
But this ain't about him no more.

388
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,252
这与我儿子有关
This is about my son.

389
00:15:22,285 --> 00:15:25,356
我的儿子贾马尔
This is about Jamal.

390
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:26,957
你关心他 对吗
You care about him, right?

391
00:15:26,991 --> 00:15:29,327
你知道我关心他
You know I care about him.

392
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,096
是的 嗯 他目前情况很糟糕
Yeah, well, he's in a real bad place right now.

393
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:34,132
而且不管怎么说
And no matter how you spin it,

394
00:15:34,164 --> 00:15:37,468
他之所以会这样子也是因为你的选择
he's in that place because of the choices that you made.

395
00:15:39,303 --> 00:15:40,605
现在
Now...

396
00:15:40,638 --> 00:15:44,609
我并不在乎其他人是怎么看我的
I don't really care what anybody think about me.

397
00:15:44,641 --> 00:15:47,444
没错 我是个自私的混蛋
Yeah, I'm a selfish son of a bitch.

398
00:15:47,477 --> 00:15:49,279
生活造就了现在的我
Life made me like this.

399
00:15:49,313 --> 00:15:51,649
但是
But...

400
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:53,451
贾马尔不是混蛋
Jamal's not.

401
00:15:53,483 --> 00:15:55,786
所以我想帮助他
And I'm here to help him.

402
00:15:55,819 --> 00:15:57,688
但是没有你的话我也帮不上忙
And I can't do that without you.

403
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,592
我写了个曲子
I wrote something.

404
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:13,371
给
Here.

405
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:27,185
如果重新开始播放
If you can start this over,

406
00:16:27,217 --> 00:16:28,519
我想我有了点想法
I think I got something.

407
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:32,023
嗯 如果你有什么想法 不如把它录下来吧
Well, if you got something, why don't we just record it?

408
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,239

# I wake up in the morning, what I'm thankful for #

409
00:16:49,272 --> 00:16:51,375

# But you, my God, is what I'm thankful for #

410
00:16:51,408 --> 00:16:53,410

# I can see my life, it flash behind yours #

411
00:16:53,443 --> 00:16:55,512

# But when I look at you, I'm seeing so much more #

412
00:16:55,546 --> 00:16:58,016

# I thank God I could never get enough of this #

413
00:16:58,048 --> 00:17:00,018

# Now I'm hearing they want me, I'm such a lucky bitch #

414
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,520

# I'm no killa, but on me I'm-a clutch the fifth #

415
00:17:02,552 --> 00:17:04,354

# But when I'm with you, boy, we on a different tip #

416
00:17:04,387 --> 00:17:06,057

# A different tip, I'm a survivor #

417
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:08,393

# You know I been through this, it's like I live through this #

418
00:17:08,425 --> 00:17:10,360

# Everybody know Freda, she hit the ground and go #

419
00:17:10,394 --> 00:17:12,864

# You put me in the booth and we tore it down fo' sho' #

420
00:17:12,896 --> 00:17:15,399

# It was time when I didn't have nothing, you was there for me #

421
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:17,871

# Instead of pretending, acting just like you cared for me... #

422
00:17:21,445 --> 00:17:24,415
嘿 马尔
Hey, Mal.

423
00:17:24,448 --> 00:17:26,450
我今天去见了弗雷达
I went to see Freda today.

424
00:17:31,074 --> 00:17:34,045
她说什么了
What'd she say?

425
00:17:34,077 --> 00:17:35,412
对着我没说多少
Not much to me.

426
00:17:35,446 --> 00:17:38,916
她 呃 一直很顽固
She was, uh, stubborn till the end.

427
00:17:38,949 --> 00:17:41,552
我说想帮她找代表律师
I offered to help her with her legal representation,

428
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:43,622
但是她拒绝了
but she refused.

429
00:17:45,622 --> 00:17:48,759
那是因为她很正直 爸爸
It's 'cause she has integrity, Dad.

430
00:17:48,793 --> 00:17:50,962
是啊 嗯 最后她还是接受了
Yeah, well, in the end, she accepted it.

431
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:58,302
她拜托我给你个东西
She wanted me to give you something.

432
00:18:04,775 --> 00:18:06,744
还有我想说的是
And just so you know,

433
00:18:06,776 --> 00:18:09,580
我今天了结了这个恶性循环
I ended the cycle today.

434
00:18:09,613 --> 00:18:11,382
她不再生气了
She ain't mad no more.

435
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,103

# I wake up in the morning #

436
00:18:33,136 --> 00:18:34,504

# What I'm thankful for #

437
00:18:34,537 --> 00:18:36,473

# But you, my God, is what I'm thankful for #

438
00:18:36,507 --> 00:18:38,676

# I can see my life, it flash behind yours #

439
00:18:38,709 --> 00:18:41,278

# But when I look at you, I'm seeing so much more #

440
00:18:41,312 --> 00:18:43,046

# I thank God I could never get enough of this #

441
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,283

# Now I'm hearing they want me, I'm such a lucky bitch #

442
00:18:45,315 --> 00:18:46,983

# I'm no killa, but on me I'm-a clutch the fifth #

443
00:18:47,017 --> 00:18:49,453

# But when I'm with you, boy, we on a different tip #

444
00:18:49,487 --> 00:18:51,322

# A different tip, I'm a survivor #

445
00:18:51,354 --> 00:18:53,690

# You know I been through this, it's like I live through this #

446
00:18:53,724 --> 00:18:55,893

# Everybody know Freda, she hit the ground and go #

447
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,129

# You put me in the booth and we tore it down fo' sho' #

448
00:18:58,161 --> 00:19:00,297

# It was time when I didn't have nothing, you was there for me #

449
00:19:00,331 --> 00:19:02,533

# Instead of pretending, acting just like you cared for me #

450
00:19:02,565 --> 00:19:04,669

# And you now I never ran, never will, homie... #

451
00:19:27,857 --> 00:19:30,494

# There's been a few times you cried #

452
00:19:33,596 --> 00:19:37,067

# And even more times they lied #

453
00:19:37,101 --> 00:19:39,404

# Messing with the wrong crowd #

454
00:19:39,437 --> 00:19:42,207

# Feeling like a big cloud's... #

455
00:19:54,051 --> 00:19:56,888

# There's been a few times you cried #

456
00:19:56,921 --> 00:19:59,356

# Even more times they lied #

457
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,560

# Messing with the wrong crowd, feeling like a big cloud's... #

458
00:20:02,593 --> 00:20:04,695

# La, la, la #

459
00:20:04,728 --> 00:20:07,031

# Suddenly the guards have changed #

460
00:20:07,064 --> 00:20:09,767

# I'm whispering your name. #

461

敬劳拉和哈基姆

464
00:20:22,613 --> 00:20:24,548
明天 你们两位将在里昂家族的名义下
Tomorrow, you two will be joined together

465
00:20:24,582 --> 00:20:28,219
携手步入婚姻殿堂
in holy matrimony under the Lyon banner

466
00:20:28,251 --> 00:20:29,753
为帝国公司再续辉煌

你听说过他 亲爱的
You've read about him, sweetie.

474
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,740
他在拉斯维加斯
He shot up

475
00:20:50,774 --> 00:20:52,142
创立了那间酒吧
that club in Vegas.

476
00:20:52,176 --> 00:20:53,644
为了打败那个白人说唱歌手

477
00:20:53,677 --> 00:20:55,446
如果他来

参加我女儿的婚礼 我会很不快
I wouldn't feel too comfortable having at my daughter's wedding.

嗯 这对我们而言就是个麻烦

我们真的希望他别出席

483
00:21:07,324 --> 00:21:08,993
听着 玛丽亚 阿图罗

我娶劳拉的一个主要原因就是

488
00:21:16,834 --> 00:21:18,603
为了摆脱那段历史
is to break away from that history.

489
00:21:18,635 --> 00:21:20,837
就像贾马尔说的
Just like Jamal said.

490
00:21:20,871 --> 00:21:23,274
我们将组建属于自己的家庭 对吗 宝贝

498
00:22:00,044 --> 00:22:01,546
TT 你的大提琴声音一点也不突出
T.T., your cello is getting completely lost.

499
00:22:01,578 --> 00:22:03,513
在声乐之间 你得把音量
So in between the vocals, you need to make it soar

500
00:22:03,546 --> 00:22:04,515
再提高一些
a little bit more.

501
00:22:04,547 --> 00:22:05,815
拜托了 这非常关键
Come on, that's a real moment.

507
00:22:48,057 --> 00:22:49,259
贾马尔
Jamal?

508
00:22:49,293 --> 00:22:51,362
嗯 我跟他简单谈了一下
Well, I had a little talk with him,

509
00:22:51,394 --> 00:22:54,164
我很确信他会写点新歌
and I'm pretty sure some music is gonna come from it.

510
00:22:55,732 --> 00:22:57,601
那么 有什么想法吗

等我们一下
Give us a minute.

513
00:23:07,143 --> 00:23:09,113
她的保镖没来得及阻止
She just ran right out there before her bodyguard

514
00:23:09,145 --> 00:23:10,213
她就跑上去了
could stop her.

515
00:23:10,247 --> 00:23:11,548
噢 天哪
Oh, my God.

516
00:23:11,582 --> 00:23:12,850

522
00:23:30,805 --> 00:23:32,039
哈
Huh?

523
00:23:32,072 --> 00:23:33,841
我宁愿自杀
I'd rather kill myself

524
00:23:33,873 --> 00:23:35,509
也不想被迫揭发卢修斯
than to be forced to snitch on Lucious.

525
00:23:35,543 --> 00:23:36,611
不 不 不
No, no, no, no, no, no.

526
00:23:36,643 --> 00:23:38,078
我们不会让你陷入那种境地的
We're not gonna let that happen to you.

527
00:23:38,112 --> 00:23:40,247
他们会逼我作证 他们会
They're gonna make me testify. They're gonna put me in

528
00:23:40,281 --> 00:23:42,015
把我列入证人保护计划 我做不到
the witness protection program. I can't do that.

529
00:23:42,048 --> 00:23:43,216
告诉她 卢修斯
Tell her, Lucious.

530
00:23:43,249 --> 00:23:45,285
嘿 我有好消息要告诉你
Hey, I got good news for you.

531
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,590
瑟斯发现联邦调查局必须在大陪审团前
Thirsty found out that the Feds got to put on their trial

532
00:23:48,621 --> 00:23:50,390
进行审判
before the grand jury...

533
00:23:50,423 --> 00:23:52,392
在一天半之内 亲爱的
...in a day and a half, sweetheart.

534
00:23:52,426 --> 00:23:55,062
所以你只需再多冷静两天
So all you got to do is be cool for two more days.

我知道我俩之间有过不和

538
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:07,242
但你肚子里还有个生命
But you are carrying a life.

539
00:24:08,742 --> 00:24:10,745
我的孙子
My grandson.

540
00:24:12,746 --> 00:24:14,148
所以你决不会是孤独一人
So you'll never be alone.

541
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,182
你听到了吗
You hear me?

542
00:24:16,449 --> 00:24:19,120
因为我明白孤独的滋味
'Cause I know what that feels like.

564
00:25:07,634 --> 00:25:09,503

# Ooh, ooh-ooh #

565
00:25:09,536 --> 00:25:11,939

# I'm-a keep on loving #

566
00:25:11,971 --> 00:25:14,107

# Loving you #

567
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,776

# Ooh, ooh... #

568
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,112
大家 大家
Y'all. Y'all.

569
00:25:18,144 --> 00:25:19,980
杰夫 杰夫
Jeff. Jeff.

570
00:25:20,014 --> 00:25:21,148
首先 我很喜欢
First of all, I love it.

571
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,616
-谢谢 伙计 -我真的很喜欢
- Thank you, man. - I really do.

572
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,986
呃 唯一一个我觉得需要改动的地方是
Um, the only change that I would say is

573
00:25:25,018 --> 00:25:26,987
当我在唱这一句的时候 呃
there's a moment where I'm singing, um...

574
00:25:27,021 --> 00:25:29,123
# I'm gonna keep on loving you. #

575
00:25:29,156 --> 00:25:30,958
不要 呃
So instead of, um...

576
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,459
不要只是“噢噢噢Oohs”这样和声
instead of just doing the "Oohs,"

577
00:25:32,493 --> 00:25:34,829
能不能这样唱 呃 “Loving you”
can we just say, uh... # Loving you. #

578
00:25:34,862 --> 00:25:36,029
-噢 好的 我喜欢 -好的
- Oh, yeah, I like that. - Yeah.

579
00:25:36,063 --> 00:25:37,031
大家明白了吗
Everybody got that?

580
00:25:37,064 --> 00:25:39,534
二 三 四 一
Two, three, four, one...

581
00:25:39,566 --> 00:25:42,202

# Whoa-o, whoa-o, whoa #

582
00:25:42,236 --> 00:25:46,341

# Loving you #

583
00:25:47,373 --> 00:25:51,078

# Loving you #

584
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,683

# Loving you #

585
00:25:56,717 --> 00:25:59,320

# Loving you #

586
00:25:59,352 --> 00:26:01,721

# Just keep on loving you #

587
00:26:01,755 --> 00:26:04,859

- # Loving you... # - Ah!

588
00:26:04,891 --> 00:26:05,563
不 不 不用 我没事 我没事 我没事
No, no, no, no, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

589
00:26:05,588 --> 00:26:06,568
你没事吧
You all right?

590
00:26:06,593 --> 00:26:07,562
-你确定吗 -是的 是的 我没事
- You sure? - Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

591
00:26:07,594 --> 00:26:08,563
呃 这样吧
Uh, you know what?

592
00:26:08,595 --> 00:26:09,663
我们待会再继续
Let's just continue this later,

593
00:26:09,697 --> 00:26:10,831
等贾马尔感觉好些了
when Jamal feels a little better...

594
00:26:10,863 --> 00:26:12,232
不 没必要
No. Absolutely not.

595
00:26:12,265 --> 00:26:13,567
别听他的 拜托 大伙儿
Do not listen to him. Come on, y'all.

596
00:26:13,601 --> 00:26:15,202
我们明天之内必须做好
We have to be done by tomorrow.

597
00:26:15,235 --> 00:26:17,004
我没事 继续吧
I'm fine. Come on.

598
00:26:17,036 --> 00:26:18,672
我很好
I'm okay.

599
00:26:18,706 --> 00:26:19,840
-是吗 -我很好
- Yeah? - I'm fine.

600
00:26:19,872 --> 00:26:21,508
你别乱着急
Calm that ass down.

601
00:26:21,542 --> 00:26:23,377
-二 三 四 一 二 -来吧 大家 一起唱
- Two, three, four, one, two... - Come on, y'all, let's sing.

602
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:26,547

# Loving you #

603
00:26:27,981 --> 00:26:31,885

# Loving you #

604
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:36,290

# Loving you #

605
00:26:37,423 --> 00:26:41,362

# Loving you #

606
00:26:41,394 --> 00:26:42,362

# Said it feels good #

607
00:26:42,396 --> 00:26:43,531

# Loving you #

608
00:26:43,564 --> 00:26:46,100

# Just to keep on loving you #

609
00:26:46,132 --> 00:26:48,535

- # Hey, said it feels good # - # Loving you #

610
00:26:48,569 --> 00:26:51,606

# Just to keep on loving you, oh #

611
00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:54,708

- # Said, oh, baby # - # Loving you #

612
00:26:54,742 --> 00:26:56,377

# Ooh #

613
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:58,112

# Loving you #

614
00:27:01,415 --> 00:27:04,051

# Loving you... #

615
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:06,920
你为贾马尔所做的事
What you did for Jamal...

616
00:27:06,954 --> 00:27:08,923
没别的人能办到 卢修斯
nobody else could've done that, Lucious.

617
00:27:08,956 --> 00:27:10,057
拜托
Come on.

618
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:11,559
搞得我一直在想
Got me over here thinking

619
00:27:11,592 --> 00:27:13,727
也许你根本没那么坏呢
maybe you ain't the devil after all.

620
00:27:15,929 --> 00:27:18,632
怎么 你觉得我关心那个孩子吗
What, you think I care about that boy?

621
00:27:18,666 --> 00:27:20,768
他替我挣了好多好多钱
He make me a whole lot of money.

622
00:27:20,801 --> 00:27:23,638
-啊 -住嘴
- Ah! - Stop it.

623
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,840
你知道我喜欢你下手更重一些
You know I like it when you do it harder.

624
00:27:25,872 --> 00:27:27,174
噢 得了吧
Oh, God.

625
00:27:29,109 --> 00:27:32,813
我发誓 我希望联邦调查局能放过这些破事
I swear, I hope all this crap is over with the Feds.

626
00:27:32,845 --> 00:27:36,316
尤其是他们在大陪审团面前拿不出任何证据
Especially when they come up empty with the grand jury.

627
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:36,842
嗯
Mm.

628
00:27:36,867 --> 00:27:38,319
是啊 嗯 他们似乎退缩了
Yeah, well, they seem to have backed off.

629
00:27:38,352 --> 00:27:40,787
也许怪人塔里克被钳制住了
Maybe Tariq the Freak got his wrist slapped.

630
00:27:45,793 --> 00:27:47,794
你知道吗 如果你当时在我身边
You know, none of this stuff would've happened

631
00:27:47,827 --> 00:27:50,797
这一切都不会发生
if you'd been around.

632
00:27:50,831 --> 00:27:52,766
没了你我什么也不是
I was never any good without you.

633
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,435
够了 卢修斯
All right, Lucious.

634
00:27:54,467 --> 00:27:56,137
-别说这些话了 伙计 -怎么了
- Stop all that talk, man. - What?

635
00:27:57,336 --> 00:27:59,272
你知道我俩的这个话题从来不会和平收尾的
You know that never ends well for me and you.

636
00:27:59,305 --> 00:28:00,307
别说了
Cut it out.

637
00:28:02,976 --> 00:28:06,213
我不该放你走的
I should've never let you go.

638
00:28:06,246 --> 00:28:08,583
我没再婚是有原因的
There's a reason I never married anybody else.

639
00:28:13,853 --> 00:28:17,658
听着 我们还是先把你儿子明天的婚礼办完再说吧
Look, let's just get your son married tomorrow.

640
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,459
那之后也许我们能聊聊这个
Maybe we'll talk.

641
00:28:19,493 --> 00:28:21,294
噢 我喜欢也许
Ooh, I like maybe.

642
00:28:21,327 --> 00:28:22,729
让我们为也许干杯吧
Let's toast to maybe.

643
00:28:22,763 --> 00:28:23,731
也许
Maybe.

644
00:28:23,764 --> 00:28:24,832
-也许 -也许
- Maybe. - Maybe.

645
00:28:24,864 --> 00:28:27,034
也许你那根软面条还能用
Maybe if that noodle works.

646
00:28:27,066 --> 00:28:28,803
再给我一颗伟哥就行
Give me one of them blue pills.

647
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,304
再见 卢修斯
Good-bye, Lucious.

648
00:28:31,337 --> 00:28:33,473
-肮脏的老男人 -嗯
- Dirty old man. - Mm!

649
00:28:33,506 --> 00:28:35,476
-嗯 -我喜欢看着你走开的样子
- Hmm. - I like watching you walk away.

650
00:28:35,508 --> 00:28:36,477
我知道你喜欢
I know you do.

651
00:28:36,509 --> 00:28:37,477
给我看看
Twerk it for me.

652
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,814
啊 啊 啊
Ah, ah, ah...!

653
00:28:39,846 --> 00:28:41,548
不要盯着我看 啊 啊
Get your ones out. Ah, ah...!

654
00:28:41,582 --> 00:28:42,650

# I can show you something #

655
00:28:42,682 --> 00:28:44,517

# That ain't none of them can #

656
00:28:44,551 --> 00:28:46,487

# 'Cause I, 'cause I #

657
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:50,490

# 'Cause I ain't too cool to dance... #

658
00:28:50,524 --> 00:28:52,325
真帅
So handsome.

659
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:54,328
连你也能这么帅 哈基姆
Even you, Hakeem.

660
00:28:54,361 --> 00:28:56,063
我不知道为什么之前觉得你很丑
I don't know why I thought you were ugly.

661
00:28:56,095 --> 00:28:57,832
奶奶
Grandma.

662
00:28:57,864 --> 00:28:59,499
真的吗
Really?

663
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:01,869
奶奶 你之前说我们 呃
Grandma, what did you mean when you said that we were, um,

664
00:29:01,901 --> 00:29:04,037
是为爸爸的爸爸偿还血债是什么意思
paying for the crimes of Dad's dad?

665
00:29:04,071 --> 00:29:05,740
德怀特不喜欢我提这件事
Dwight don't want me talking about that.

666
00:29:05,773 --> 00:29:07,041
嗯 我们就是我们 奶奶
Well, we are who we are, Grandma,

667
00:29:07,073 --> 00:29:09,209
不管我们父亲是否愿意谈论这个
despite whether our father wants to talk about it.

668
00:29:09,243 --> 00:29:10,845
嗯 你是对的
Well, you're right.

669
00:29:10,878 --> 00:29:12,179
你逃不掉的
You can't escape it.

670
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:14,180
这存在于他的血液里 还有他的大部分表亲
It's in him, it's in most of his cousins,

671
00:29:14,214 --> 00:29:15,182
还存在于
it's bound to be

672
00:29:15,215 --> 00:29:16,417
你们三个的血液里
in you three.

673
00:29:16,449 --> 00:29:18,552
或者至少你们其中之一
Or at least one of you.

674
00:29:18,584 --> 00:29:21,054
至于乔
As for Joe...

675
00:29:21,087 --> 00:29:23,857
嗯 乔罪有应得
well, Joe got what he deserved.

676
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,191
等等 乔
Wait, Joe?

677
00:29:25,225 --> 00:29:26,593
那是 那是我们的爷爷
That's... that's our grandfather.

678
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,602
你死定了 乔
You're a dead man, Joe.

679
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,778
他亲眼看着他父亲在自己面前死掉吗
He saw his father die in front of him?

680
00:29:44,812 --> 00:29:46,947
谁杀了他
Who shot him?

681
00:29:46,979 --> 00:29:49,249
别信她跟你们说的任何话
Don't believe anything she tell you.

682
00:29:49,283 --> 00:29:51,886
实际上 她只是在说我们看起来都很帅
Actually, she was just telling us how handsome we all look.

683
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:52,887
对吧 奶奶
Right, Grandma?

684
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:54,220
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

685
00:29:54,254 --> 00:29:56,055
来吧 哈基姆
Come on, Hakeem.

686
00:29:56,089 --> 00:29:58,726
来迎接你的客人们吧 伙计
Let's go welcome your guests, man.

687
00:29:58,758 --> 00:29:59,727
走吧
Let's go.

688
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:01,060
-为什么一定要做这个 -为什么一定要做这个
- Why we got to do it? - Why we got to do it?

689
00:30:01,093 --> 00:30:02,429
因为这是你的职责
'Cause it's your job!

690
00:30:09,723 --> 00:30:12,961

# You say we fight #

691
00:30:12,993 --> 00:30:16,164

# I'll say we argue #

692
00:30:16,196 --> 00:30:19,166

# Maybe you're right #

693
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,536

# That we really are through... #

694
00:30:21,568 --> 00:30:23,872
哈基姆 我很气你们
Hakeem, I'm mad at y'all.

695
00:30:23,897 --> 00:30:25,240
你们没准备鸡肉 没准备猪排 什么也没有
Y'all ain't got no chicken, no pork chops, no nothing.

696
00:30:25,265 --> 00:30:26,148
嗨
Hi!

697
00:30:26,173 --> 00:30:27,674
我不得不自己带甜甜圈过来
I had to bring my own doughnut.

698
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:29,878
把这个拿走 波莎 给我一个拥抱 
Get that out of here, Porsha. Give me a hug.

699
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,145

# That's what I'm gonna do... #

700
00:30:32,179 --> 00:30:34,349
嗨
Hi.

701
00:30:36,017 --> 00:30:39,019

# You say it's mine... #

702
00:30:39,052 --> 00:30:41,356
罗西 你看起来可不像六十多岁的样子啊
Well, Rosey, you don't look a day over 60.

703
00:30:41,388 --> 00:30:43,990
你知道我还能更年轻点的 琦琦 跟我聊聊
You know I roll younger than that, Cookie. Talk to me.

704
00:30:44,025 --> 00:30:46,027
你最好小心点 别把卢修斯惹毛了
You better watch out. Don't you piss Lucious off.

705
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:47,060
喔
Ooh.

706
00:30:48,362 --> 00:30:49,397
嘿 主人公到了
Hey, there he is.

707
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,366
新郎官 恭喜啊 哈基姆
Man of the hour. Congratulations, Hakeem.

708
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:53,000
谢谢 谢谢
Thank you, thank you.

709
00:30:53,033 --> 00:30:54,568
你确定要结婚吗 年轻人
Sure you ready to do this, young man?

710
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:55,870
我结了三次婚
I did it three times,

711
00:30:55,903 --> 00:30:57,739
现在我就得给三份赡养费了
and now I got three alimony checks.

712
00:30:57,771 --> 00:30:59,573
得了吧
Cut it out.

713
00:30:59,606 --> 00:31:01,108
我从未对任何事这么确定过
Look, I never been so sure about anything.

714
00:31:01,142 --> 00:31:02,510
-好的 祝你好运 -好吧
- All right. Good luck to you. - Okay?

715
00:31:02,542 --> 00:31:04,678
罗西
Rosey!

716
00:31:04,712 --> 00:31:06,079

717
00:31:06,113 --> 00:31:07,582
-好的 -汤米 汤米

718
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,250
-你还好吧 我的朋友 -感谢你们捧场
- How are you, my friend? - Thank you all for coming.

719
00:31:09,282 --> 00:31:11,019
你们都知道我的儿子 贾马尔
Y'all know my son Jamal.

720
00:31:11,051 --> 00:31:13,721
是啊 我密切注意着你的动向呢
Yeah. I been watching your every move.

721
00:31:13,753 --> 00:31:15,689
我很为你在美国之声音乐奖上的表演自豪
I was proud of you at the ASAs.

722
00:31:15,722 --> 00:31:16,857
谢谢
Well, thank you.

723
00:31:16,891 --> 00:31:18,393
是啊 全世界都为他自豪
Yeah, the whole world was proud of him.

724
00:31:18,425 --> 00:31:21,194
我是在说他替你挨枪子儿之前的事 里昂
I'm talking about before he took that bullet for you, L.

725
00:31:21,228 --> 00:31:23,564
我简直等不及看你甩掉你爹妈
I can't wait to hear what you do

726
00:31:23,596 --> 00:31:25,032
之后会做什么事
when you cut loose your father and mother.

727
00:31:25,066 --> 00:31:27,735
-别 -你怎么总想挑起事端呢 伙计
- No. - Why you trying to start stuff, man?

728
00:31:27,768 --> 00:31:29,437
伙计 老鹰注定要翱翔天际
Man, eagle got to fly.

729
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,872
不 不 这一切都是因为爱 你知道吗
No, no, it's all love, you know?

730
00:31:30,904 --> 00:31:32,106
不过我现在正在准备我的新独唱
I am doing my new single though.

731
00:31:32,138 --> 00:31:33,440
是由D总监制作的
And it's, uh, it's produced by D-Major.

732
00:31:33,473 --> 00:31:34,775
很好
All right.

733
00:31:34,808 --> 00:31:38,413

# That's what you want me to #

734
00:31:38,445 --> 00:31:43,584

# Ooh... #

735
00:31:49,323 --> 00:31:50,892
-太棒了 -太棒了
- Yes. - Yes!

736
00:31:50,924 --> 00:31:51,960
无与伦比
Fantastic!

737
00:31:55,796 --> 00:31:57,899
我们最顶尖的歌手之一
One of our number one artists.

738
00:32:09,343 --> 00:32:10,478
噢 那是谁
Oh, what's that?

739
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,245
等等 等等 等一下
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.

740
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:13,949

# Let the champagne spill... #

741
00:32:15,449 --> 00:32:17,317
拿着这个 宝贝
Hold that, baby. Uh.

742
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,485
呃
Mmm!

743
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,488
呃
Mmm! Mmm.

744
00:32:22,356 --> 00:32:25,460
看看那个小丑 你居然邀请了肖恩
Look at that clown. You invited Shyne?

745
00:32:25,492 --> 00:32:27,928
他带着妓女参加你儿子的婚礼
He brought hookers to your son's wedding.

746
00:32:27,962 --> 00:32:29,931
噢 噢 看看他
Oh, oh! Uh! Look at that!

747
00:32:31,132 --> 00:32:32,600
我走了 里昂
I'm out of here, L.

748
00:32:32,633 --> 00:32:34,268
-别 别 不要这样 -不 不
- No, no, no, no, no. Come on. - No, no, no, no.

749
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,436
跟我们到另一个房间去
Come with us into the other room.

750
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,771
联邦探员还在周围四处查探
Feds is still sniffing around,

751
00:32:37,805 --> 00:32:40,608
我们必须确保肖恩举止不出格
and we have to make sure Shyne behaves.

752
00:32:40,641 --> 00:32:42,944
这些主要是为了预防
It's precautionary, mostly.

753
00:32:42,977 --> 00:32:45,446
他们并没有查出些什么
Mad 'cause they got a bag full of nothing,

754
00:32:45,479 --> 00:32:47,981
就是有群傻缺们想要用我并没有
just a lame-ass task force who came up empty

755
00:32:48,014 --> 00:32:50,550
做过的事情嫁祸给我
on something I didn't do.

756
00:32:50,584 --> 00:32:51,552
可怜的卢修斯
Free Lucious.

757
00:32:51,585 --> 00:32:52,886
演出很棒
Hell of a concert.

758
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,654
是的 谢谢
Yes, thank you.

759
00:32:54,687 --> 00:32:56,991
你们肯定都知道联邦探员是怎么工作的
Now, uh, you guys know how the Feds work,

760
00:32:57,023 --> 00:32:59,760
不然你们这些年也不会尽可能远离他们
or else you wouldn't have stayed clear of them all these years.

761
00:33:01,828 --> 00:33:03,798
所以我们让肖恩闭紧大嘴巴
So it is very important that we keep Shyne

762
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:06,666
是非常重要的
as a part of our circle of silence.

763
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,569
是 但如果有人早就把肖恩供出来了
Yeah, but if somebody already gave them Shyne...

764
00:33:09,603 --> 00:33:11,839
这也就意味着肖恩不是我们唯一的麻烦
It means Shyne's not our only problem.

765
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,176
我们有几个朋友
Well, there was a couple of friends that...

766
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:18,645
我们这么说吧 他们不会再告密了
Let's just say they're not around to snitch anymore.

767
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:19,948
他们最近都退休了
They've recently retired.

768
00:33:21,615 --> 00:33:23,017
但是 肖恩不一样
Now, Shyne on the other hand,

769
00:33:23,049 --> 00:33:25,019
你知道 他就是小屁孩
you know, he's just a kid.

770
00:33:25,051 --> 00:33:27,654
他想要再次进入我们的圈子
He wants to be part of the club again.

771
00:33:27,687 --> 00:33:30,157
好吧 卢修斯
All right, Lucious.

772
00:33:30,191 --> 00:33:33,760
但是肖恩不会带来什么好东西的
But nothing good can come from Shyne's punk ass.

773
00:33:33,794 --> 00:33:35,263
了解
Understood.

774
00:33:35,296 --> 00:33:37,298
我们就给他点甜头尝尝 好吧
We'll just entertain him for a bit, okay?

775
00:33:39,032 --> 00:33:40,000
玩好婚礼这场局
Let's go do this wedding.

776
00:33:40,033 --> 00:33:41,802
就这么办
That's a plan.

777
00:33:49,376 --> 00:33:51,679
我们爱你 亲爱的
We love you, my darling.

778
00:33:51,712 --> 00:33:53,514
我们只希望你能得到最好的
We only want the best for you.

779
00:33:53,547 --> 00:33:56,150
我们希望哈基姆能守护你
We hope Hakeem keeps you safe.

780
00:33:57,918 --> 00:33:59,921


781
00:34:21,442 --> 00:34:24,077
我现在跟你们所有人讲
I'm putting you all on notice right now.

782
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,413
我兄弟马上就要推出一张专辑
My brother about to drop this album.

783
00:34:26,447 --> 00:34:28,715
而你们所有人都会想要分一杯羹 这张专辑绝对会火
All y'all gonna want a piece of this one. It's hot.

784
00:34:28,748 --> 00:34:30,150
嘿 我知道这一切都很疯狂
Hey, I know it's all crazy,

785
00:34:30,184 --> 00:34:31,319
但是会有好结果的 好吗
but it's all gonna work out, okay?

786
00:34:31,351 --> 00:34:33,221
谢谢你捧场 安妮卡
Thank you for coming, Anika.

787
00:34:33,253 --> 00:34:35,556
安妮卡・卡尔汗 你被传唤了
Anika Calhoun, you've been served.

788
00:34:35,588 --> 00:34:36,924
-法庭见 -什么
- See you in court. - What?!

789
00:34:39,626 --> 00:34:41,429
-不 -发生了什么
- No! - What's happening?

790
00:34:42,262 --> 00:34:43,898
阻止她
Stop! Stop her!

791
00:34:43,931 --> 00:34:46,101
-滚开 -先生 别挡道
- Move! - Sir, get out of the way!

792
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:51,239
放手
Get off!

793
00:34:51,271 --> 00:34:52,907
放手
Get off!

794
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,242
呵 大陪审团
Mm-hmm. Grand jury.

795
00:34:55,275 --> 00:34:57,177
这特么都是发生了什么
What the hell is going on?

796
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,445
什么
What?!

797
00:34:58,478 --> 00:35:00,447
别碰我
Get off me!

798
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,848
别碰我
Get off me!

799
00:35:01,882 --> 00:35:03,751
这就是我之前担心的
This is exactly what I was talking about.

800
00:35:03,784 --> 00:35:05,253
我不允许你嫁给他了
I'm putting a stop to it.

801
00:35:05,286 --> 00:35:06,420
肖恩 你他妈就是个蠢蛋
Shyne, you're a damn fool!

802
00:35:06,452 --> 00:35:08,255
这就是我们一开始抛弃你
That's why we dumped you the first time

803
00:35:08,288 --> 00:35:10,423
让你呆在你应该在的地方的原因
and why we keep your ghetto ass in place!

804
00:35:10,456 --> 00:35:11,458
劳拉 等等
Laura, wait!

805
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,168
宝贝 一切都在我掌控之中
Baby, I got it all under control.

806
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,635
就是有点小争执
It was just a little argument.

807
00:35:21,668 --> 00:35:22,636
没事的
It's gonna be okay.

808
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,271
不可能没事 哈基姆
It's not okay anymore, Hakeem.

809
00:35:24,304 --> 00:35:25,373
我不能
I can't.

810
00:35:25,405 --> 00:35:26,706
我不要过这样的生活
This isn't gonna be my life.

811
00:35:26,739 --> 00:35:28,041
-我很抱歉 -宝贝 我很抱歉
- I'm sorry. - Baby, I'm sorry.

812
00:35:28,074 --> 00:35:29,143
我不能嫁给你
I can't do this.

813
00:35:29,175 --> 00:35:30,110
放手
Let go of me!

814
00:35:30,143 --> 00:35:31,779
一切都会没事的
It's gonna be all right.

815
00:35:31,811 --> 00:35:33,114
你们就是一群恶棍
You're all a bunch of thugs.

816
00:35:33,146 --> 00:35:35,150
拜托 不要走
Please don't go.

817
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,448
好了
Okay.

818
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:53,119
所有人都给我滚蛋
Everybody get the hell out of here.

819
00:35:53,866 --> 00:35:54,734
滚
Go on!

820
00:35:54,767 --> 00:35:56,134
就现在
Now!

821
00:35:56,167 --> 00:35:57,502
我说了滚
I said go!

822
00:35:58,504 --> 00:35:59,971
-快滚 滚 -卢修斯 别这样
- Walk away. Go! - Lucious, stop it!

823
00:36:00,004 --> 00:36:02,674
我不是说着玩的
I'm not playing!

824
00:36:02,707 --> 00:36:04,075
韦伯 关上门
Webb, shut the door!

825
00:36:04,109 --> 00:36:06,578
好了 听着 告诉我该怎么做
All right, look, just tell me what to do.

826
00:36:06,611 --> 00:36:08,080
只要不出庭作证 我做什么都可以
I'll do whatever it takes in order to not testify.

827
00:36:11,049 --> 00:36:12,518
好 不管了
Okay, the hell with it.

828
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,046
瑟斯
Thirsty,

829
00:36:14,078 --> 00:36:16,428
-如果安妮卡和我结婚了 -等下 怎么回事
- if Anika and I get married... - Wait, what?

830
00:36:16,488 --> 00:36:18,611
-联邦探员就不能强迫她出庭作证了 对不对
...the Feds can't force her to testify... right or wrong?

831
00:36:18,636 --> 00:36:20,272
-卢修斯 -我也想到过这个办法
- Lucious. - That thought crossed my mind,

832
00:36:20,313 --> 00:36:21,780
但是你需要一张结婚证
but you'd need a marriage license.

833
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:22,781
联邦探员肯定会阻止你的
The Feds would definitely block that.

834
00:36:22,815 --> 00:36:24,383
我们在华盛顿特区订婚的时候
We already got that covered

835
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:25,817
就已经拿到证了
when we were engaged in D.C.

836
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:27,653
卢修斯 我警告你
Lucious! I'm warning you.

837
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,121
你警告我什么
You're warning me what?

838
00:36:29,155 --> 00:36:30,790
不行 你不能这么做 这是我的婚礼
No, you can't do it. This is my wedding.

839
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:32,191
她怀着我的孩子
She carrying my baby.

840
00:36:32,224 --> 00:36:33,492
是啊 伙计 我们脑子都坏了吗
Yeah, man, are we sick or something?

841
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,027
我们本应该终结这个循环
Is... We were supposed to end the cycle.

842
00:36:35,061 --> 00:36:36,829
当准备好的时候 循环就会自动终止
Cycle ends when it's ready to end.

843
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:38,798
而在那之前 我们要做必须做的事情
Till then, we do what we have to do.

844
00:36:38,831 --> 00:36:42,769
我救这婊子的命 不是为了让她毁了我的
I did not save this bitch's life so that she could ruin mine.

845

肯定还有别的办法

所赋予的权力 在上帝和你们的

871

我宣布你们结为夫妻

879
00:40:09,775 --> 00:40:13,045
你完全没想过这孩子
So it just never occurred to you that this kid is gonna be...

880
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,046
你同时会是这孩子的父亲和爷爷吗
you're gonna be his daddy and granddaddy.

881
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,048
事实是怎样就是怎样
It is what it is.

882
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,884
注意点 塔里克・卡泽斯来了

894
00:40:53,686 --> 00:40:54,887
你就会背上
You'll go down

895
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,389
杀害警察的罪名
for killing a cop.

896
00:40:56,421 --> 00:40:58,157
而你的儿子就会失去他的父亲
And your son will grow up without a father.

897
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,892
那男孩可不是我的儿子 乔
That boy ain't my son, Joe.

898
00:40:59,925 --> 00:41:00,927
他是你的儿子

噢 你是真的不知道啊
Oh, you really didn't know, huh?

906

是啊 我们的父亲是个好警察 德怀特
Yeah, our father was a good cop, Dwight.

907
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:34,093
但不是个好人
But a bad man.

908

914
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:35,320
你想要这个恶魔的孩子
You wanted that devil child

915
00:42:35,354 --> 00:42:37,490
成为帝国产业的唯一继承人 是不是
to be the only heir to the throne, didn't you?

916
00:42:37,523 --> 00:42:39,158
是不是
Didn't you?!

917
00:42:39,191 --> 00:42:41,360
