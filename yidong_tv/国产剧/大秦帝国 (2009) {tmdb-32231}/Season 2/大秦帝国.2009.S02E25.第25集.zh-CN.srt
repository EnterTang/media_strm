WHISTLES

2
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,320
Welcome back to County Antrim where
we have assembled the top handlers

3
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,560
from England, Ireland, Scotland
and Wales who are battling it out

4
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,480
to become One Man And His Dog
champions of 2009.

5
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,320
Last time, Sophie Holt,
the young English handler,
stormed into the lead,

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,760
but how long can England stay there?

7
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,800
We've only done one round. There
are three more to go - the singles,
the brace and the supreme.

8
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,840
As ever, our trialling experts, Gus
Dermody and Matt Baker, are keeping
their beady eyes on everything.

9
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,760
Matt, can England hold on
to that lead?

10
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,320
Sophie has put them 18 points clear.

11
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,840
All the points in every round
are added together,

12
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,280
so that's a difficult gap to close.

13
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,120
In the singles, we've got national
champion after national champion.
It is an incredible standard.

14
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,960
I think they'll be fairly
consistent, so at the end of today,
England could still be in front.

15
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,200
OK, let's take a closer look
at the course.

16
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,640
Seven sheep are set next to the lift
post at the far end of the course.

17
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,680
The handler sends his dog out

18
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,160
on a right or left-hand outrun
to reach them - 20 points.

19
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,440
The dog approaches the sheep
and gets them to move back

20
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,200
towards the handler
with the lift - 10 points.

21
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,120
The sheep are taken on a straight
fetch through the fetch gates

22
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,240
towards the handler - 20 points.

23
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,600
Next, the drive.
Starting to the left,

24
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,800
the dog must drive the sheep
over a triangular course

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,240
through two sets of drive gates.

26
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,680
Once the sheep have passed through
the second set of drive gates,

27
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,800
the handler can leave the post.

28
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,840
The drive ends when the sheep are
in the shedding ring - 30 points.

29
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,760
One of the two sheep with
red collars has to be singled off

30
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,880
and held by the dog - 10 points.

31
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,120
The sheep are moved to the pen.

32
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,760
The trial is complete
when all seven sheep are in the pen

33
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,480
and the gate is closed -
a final 10 points.

34
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,840
The course should be completed
within 15 minutes

35
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,240
and there's 100 points to play for.

36
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,760
It sounds like another tough course
for our handlers.

37
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,800
Their performance is going
to be judged by Michael Glynn
and Glyn Howells.

38
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,040
They will be ensuring fair play and
awarding points for every section.

39
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,880
Scotland are lying
in fourth position,

40
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,120
so it's their competitor who has
the unenviable task of going first.

41
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,320
His name is Stuart Davidson.
Let's find out a little bit more
about him and his dog, Jim.

42
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:07,120
Hello, my name is Stuart Davidson.
The dog I'm running today
in One Man And His Dog is Jim.

43
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,720
I live on a sheep farm just outside
Dunoon, 30 miles west of Glasgow.

44
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,840
How I got involved in trialling
was my wife, Margaret.

45
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,320
Her father and Margaret used to run
many years ago and I played shinty.

46
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:29,280
Shinty is
the old Scottish traditional game
that's very similar to hockey.

47
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,920
And it was either running the
sheepdogs or keep on playing shinty.

48
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,200
So I stopped the shinty
and started running sheepdogs.
It's all Margaret's fault.

49
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,440
I started trialling,
I had a bit of success,

50
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,480
I won five
Scottish National Champions
and two International Champions.

51
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,720
I've competed on One Man And His Dog
three times.

52
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,760
The first time was down in Balloch
in 1981.

53
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,600
I've had Jim since he was
six months old,

54
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,800
I trained him myself.

55
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,560
He's not too fond of people,
but he loves sheep.

56
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,600
Jim is off a son of Star.
Star won the Nursery Final
when he was a young dog

57
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,320
and also won the International.

58
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,520
Hopefully, Jim and I will do well,
as we did with Star.

59
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,160
Well, first up to the post
for the singles

60
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,720
is Stuart Davidson from Scotland
with his dog Jim

61
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,080
who is looking very keen
to get cracking. Away!

62
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,840
Going out wide,
but he'd spotted the sheep

63
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,720
before he set off down the field,
so this is a good outrun.

64
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,040
STUART WHISTLES

65
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,120
Yes, he's just overflanked a little
bit at the end of the outrun.

66
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,160
But he's got them lifted
and they're on the fetch.

67
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,320
17 points out of 20 for the outrun,
9 points for the lift.

68
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,360
Jim's out of sight
beyond the ridge.

69
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,440
Is he going to pop up further over?
He's missed the sheep

70
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,320
and the sheep
have drifted off-line.

71
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,800
There's still a bit of distance,
so there's time for a recovery yet.

72
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,880
He's coming on to them now.

73
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,760
He's got them settled,

74
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,520
but it's just this bad fetch,
he's going to be penalised.

75
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,480
The "away" command
to go to the right,

76
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,120
nicely through the middle
and back on-line again now.

77
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,120
Steady, Jim! Away...

78
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,560
Just a slight little wobble
in the middle, but going well.

79
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,640
He's a very sleek dog,
is Jim, isn't he?

80
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,520
Away... Here!

81
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,960
Come by... Here!

82
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,080
Come by... Here! Come by...

83
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,400
Oh, that was
a good, good turn-round.

84
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,520
13 points out of 20 for the fetch.

85
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,880
They're nicely settled as they
start off on this left-hand drive.

86
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,800
This is a good line,
going towards these first gates.

87
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,120
Jim, Jim, come by! Here!

88
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,840
He's so fast once he gets going.
You can see the eagerness.

89
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,360
Away! The sheep are coming
up the field a little bit too much,

90
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,480
so Jim's having to be brought in
towards Stuart

91
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,280
and he's not coming
fast enough this time.

92
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,480
They're well off-line now.

93
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,000
Away!

94
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,320
Here! Away!

95
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,760
He's going round fast,
got them through.

96
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,920
Unbelievable! That was dramatic.
I didn't think he'd get that.

97
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,480
Whistles like a foot
on the accelerator.

98
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,400
He just blows
and, whoa, off he goes!

99
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,880
Jim!
HE WHISTLES

100
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,600
And he's got them settled again.

101
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,200
23 points out of 30 for the drive.

102
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,720
A little bit of milling.

103
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,000
Stuart's looking to single off
one of those sheep

104
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,840
that's wearing a red collar. They
are quite young, they're "gimmers".

105
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,440
This will be the first time
they've been sheared.

106
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,280
I wonder how many times
they've seen a dog, Gus.

107
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,800
Not a lot. They just do not like
splitting, these youngsters.

108
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,360
So they're going back to their pals
as quickly as they can.

109
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,440
Chance coming here?

110
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,480
Oh! No, she's back in.

111
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,960
And they're at the other end now.

112
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,360
Here's a chance coming.

113
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,840
The dog's ready.
Stuart's creeping in.

114
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,720
He's got it there.

115
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,560
It has been accepted.

116
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,360
And the sheep are regrouped

117
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,240
as Stuart moves over to the pen.

118
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,800
10 points awarded, then.

119
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,560
Come by. Here.

120
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,320
Jim.

121
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,280
Don't want to pressure the sheep
too much at this stage

122
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,320
but keep them moving.

123
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,960
Away. Stand.

124
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,640
Away. Stand. Away. Stand.

125
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,360
Come by.

126
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,160
They look like they're quite
intrigued by the inside of that pen.

127
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,080
Yes, he's got them boxed quite well

128
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,960
but it's gently does it.

129
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,480
They're going... Oh, man!
There was half a sheep in there!

130
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,360
They've all got to go, and that gate
shut. That looks successful now.

131
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,040
That'll do, Jim. Super stuff!

132
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,800
What a round from Stuart and Jim.

133
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Eight scored for the pen.
A total of 80. Wonderful stuff.

134
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,200
Stuart and Jim, you've got to be
happy with that one! Well done!

135
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,840
Any idea what you might have scored?

136
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,800
No. Did it feel
like a good round to you?

137
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,800
No! Didn't it?
What were you disappointed by?

138
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,120
The fetch. I lost him
for a couple of seconds in the...

139
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,080
Well, you still got a great score.
Oh, well. You got 80. 80.

140
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,200
So Scotland are very much
back in the running,

141
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,040
thanks to the two of you.
Congratulations to Jim. Thank you.

142
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,080
Our next competitor to tackle
this very tricky course

143
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,920
is Alan Lloyd Jones,
he lives in Bala in North Wales.

144
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,440
Let's meet him and his dog, Bet.

145
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,800
My name is Alan Lloyd Jones

146
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,480
and my dog's name is Bet.

147
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,960
We live on a farm
in North Wales near Bala.

148
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,200
The farm's 1,250ft above sea level.

149
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,480
There's not many farms
in North Wales higher than that.

150
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,360
# Have a nice day... #

151
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,880
Bet's commands are in Welsh
AND in English.

152
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,360
When she's near,
we speak Welsh with her.

153
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,680
HE SPEAKS WELSH

154
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,200
Bet is a one-man dog,
she won't listen to nobody else,

155
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,640
even if they're on the same commands
as me. She just works for me.

156
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,760
And she's with me everywhere.

157
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,800
# She's a lady

158
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,760
# Wo-oh, wo-oh, oh
She's a lady... #

159
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,200
Bet's been working on Welsh
mountain sheep all her life.

160
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,240
That will be a problem when we go
to One Man And His Dog.

161
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,240
They say the sheep will be much
bigger sheep than ours.

162
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,360
It's the same as people
that's been driving a Mini

163
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,080
all their life and the next thing
they'll be driving a BMW!

164
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,440
Much bigger thing, so...
we'll see how things go.

165
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,920
HE SPEAKS WELSH

166
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,360
And that means, good luck to Wales
and I hope we can win it.

167
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,000
# ..And the lady is mine. #

168
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,600
Well, Alan Lloyd Jones

169
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,040
and his dog, Bet,
have it all to do here for Wales.

170
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,680
HE WHISTLES

171
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,520
She was just turning in that little
bit, but she's going out now.

172
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,440
She's certainly running
a long way round, there.

173
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,120
Coming nicely round
at the bottom of the field,

174
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,760
behind the sheep now.

175
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,320
Just see Malcolm at the back
with his dog, Sam,

176
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,240
they were holding the sheep
at the lift post.

177
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,560
Just 2 points lost
on the outrun, 18 scored.

178
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,600
And 10 points for the lift.

179
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,160
Yes. Now, Alan's whistling the dog
on but the dog's casting back.

180
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,680
So he's using his voice now to try
and bring the dog over the rise.

181
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,240
HE WHISTLES
Lie down. Come by.

182
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,600
He's still got to push them over
yet, they're still to the right

183
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,520
of the gate now,

184
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,320
coming into the centre position.

185
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,800
Nicely through.

186
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,840
Come by, come by. Lie down.

187
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,240
Come by, come by, come by.
HE SPEAKS WELSH

188
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,280
As the sheep come
a little bit closer,

189
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,440
you can hear Alan has transferred
to voice commands

190
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,840
and he uses both English and Welsh.

191
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,000
Good line through that turn.

192
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,720
Yes, and what a responsive dog.

193
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,920
16 points for the fetch.

194
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,960
Well, this is an excellent line,

195
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,480
right from his feet,
right to the first drive gate.

196
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,520
They're through.

197
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,880
ALAN WHISTLES

198
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,640
They may gain speed a little bit
as they go down into the dip.

199
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,600
But a beautiful distance there
between sheep and dog.

200
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,800
And this really is the tricky part
of the course.

201
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,840
This bit right here.
HE WHISTLES

202
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,200
Now he's in with a chance.

203
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,640
And absolutely through the middle

204
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,680
and well under control.
That was good.

205
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,200
It's difficult to emphasise, Gus,
how difficult these sheep are

206
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,320
to control and how easy
this is being made to look.

207
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,200
Lie down. Come by.

208
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,000
He's holding her back a little bit
as they come into the shedding ring.

209
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,320
We want them really settled.
Lie down.

210
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,600
26 out of 30 for the drive.

211
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,640
Interesting to see
how he works these.

212
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,320
He's got a collared ewe on the left.

213
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,360
There's a gap coming.

214
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,640
She's just that little bit jittery.

215
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,200
As he moved. The dog wasn't moving
at all, but as Alan moved.

216
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,640
One of the other ewes, she's
for off if given half the chance.

217
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,360
She's on the right
of the picture now.

218
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,240
She's the dodgy...
There she goes again.

219
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,080
That's an awkward sheep and that's
going to prove difficult.

220
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,480
Lie down.

221
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,520
The one thing you can't do
is rush it.

222
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,800
HE SHOUTS A COMMAND

223
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,840
Here we go.

224
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,160
He's come in and he's got her.

225
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,840
Lie down.

226
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,520
Come by. Come by.

227
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,760
Lie down.

228
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,120
8 points awarded for the single.

229
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,480
Lie down.

230
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,360
Here. And so, it's now to the pen.

231
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,960
Lie down. Lie down.

232
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,320
They're looking in.

233
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,000
Lie down.

234
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,440
In with a chance now. Lie down.

235
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,720
They're having a look. Go on!

236
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,040
This could be it.

237
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,080
This could be it - there they go!

238
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,720
What about that?

239
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,400
Oh! And there's a sheep
jumped over the pen!

240
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,040
We've got sheep agility here!

241
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,360
7 given for the pen,
that's a total of 85.

242
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,320
Well, Alan has been trialling
since he was 10 years old

243
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,320
and all of that experience
came into play there.

244
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,760
Now, there's a smiling Welshman!

245
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,920
You've got to be pleased with that!

246
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,200
Yeah, but there were
little bits by the pen.

247
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,680
There was a very awkward ewe
in there. Yes.

248
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,120
I bet you were hoping that she's
going to be your next lamb sandwich!

249
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,360
Well, it would be better if she had
a collar on, wouldn't it?

250
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,960
Well, congratulations to you both.
Thank you.

251
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,000
Excellent round. 85, you scored.
85. Thank you very much.

252
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,720
So you're in the lead so far.

253
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:49,120
I'll let you get off. Our next
competitor, who has got to try and
beat that magnificent Welsh score,

254
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,760
is our home competitor.
It's Seamus Gallagher.

255
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,080
And let's find out a little bit more
about him and his dog, Glen.

256
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,440
My name's Seamus Gallagher
and I'll be running my dog, Glen.

257
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,160
I live on a farm in Glenravel in the
glens of Antrim in Northern Ireland.

258
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,040
I'm a welder by trade.
I work in Belfast.

259
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,880
And I'm a part-time farmer,
in the evening and the weekends.

260
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,840
My brother's heavily involved
in trialling

261
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,200
and my daughter is interested
in trialling, too.

262
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,400
She's competing in the national
this year for the first,

263
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,400
she's coming 18
and she's very enthusiastic.

264
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,840
I got into trialling
23, 24 years ago.

265
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,000
It was very satisfying
to have a young dog,

266
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,200
and to train him right up
through to compete at open level.

267
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,720
A dog's natural hunting instinct

268
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,640
with sheep comes from nature.

269
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,600
And you're communicating
with nature to control that.

270
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,400
And you're using it to work the
animals that you're keeping.

271
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,160
Glen's five years old, in his prime.

272
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,520
Good-natured dog. Very determined

273
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,360
and sometimes very hard to stop!

274
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,000
He should run well
in One Man And His Dog.

275
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,320
But it will depend a lot
on the sheep.

276
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,840
Seamus Gallagher

277
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,960
with his dog, Glen. Only a small
dog but quite a pushy one.

278
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,000
So it's going to be quite
interesting to see how

279
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,600
the sheep react to him.

280
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,560
Yes, and it's a good start,

281
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,040
going down to the right.

282
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,480
No whistles.

283
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,000
And starting to come
across the bottom.

284
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,160
HE WHISTLES

285
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,200
Just 1 point lost on the outrun,

286
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,120
a score of 19.

287
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,520
And just 1 point lost on the lift.
9 scored.

288
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,040
28 so far.

289
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,720
SEAMUS WHISTLES

290
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,400
Goodness me, this is certainly
the fastest fetch we've had

291
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,440
in this competition. Well,
they say it's a fairly pushy dog!

292
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,520
Goodness me! They're coming up here
at a pace!

293
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,200
Now, what will happen?
Will they come up too fast

294
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,000
and he won't be able to turn them?
Dog's covering them,

295
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,040
stopping them escaping.

296
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,840
There will be some
points lost here

297
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,360
because they're
too far off line.

298
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,880
But at least they're
all bunched together.

299
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,920
Glen working well.

300
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,520
HE WHISTLES

301
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,880
And away they go, onto the drive.
This is going to be a very fast run.

302
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,240
17 out of 20 scored on the fetch.

303
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,560
I tell you what, Glen does have a
tendency to like to get it done,

304
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,920
Seamus says. Likes to race
about the field at 100mph.

305
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,280
And we've seen proof of that now.

306
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,600
Turning them gently.
He's giving them nice room

307
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,560
but they're setting off fairly fast

308
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,480
and they're coming uphill
a little bit, towards us.

309
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,640
The sheep travelling fast
on the cross drive.

310
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,160
HE WHISTLES COMMANDS

311
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,600
Seamus whistling
the dog to take the inside flank

312
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,760
to turn them back uphill. This is
going to be extremely difficult.

313
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,160
I think we're going
to have a miss here.

314
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,960
Yes, this side of the drive gates,
he can't have a second attempt

315
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,920
at it and they've
now gone well past.

316
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,960
This has a very different feel
to the previous rounds we've seen,

317
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,480
especially with Alan Lloyd Jones -
a very steady, calm round,

318
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,440
and this is, er, I've got a feeling
it's pretty frantic.

319
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,720
Seamus will be very disappointed.

320
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,160
15 scored for the drive.

321
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,280
Now he's got things settled again.
He's just letting those sheep
settle.

322
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,720
The sheep are
just showing that they've done
a little bit of running.

323
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,640
And typical, there are the collared
ewes right in the middle.

324
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,480
Right in the middle.
He's got to prise one of those
away from the others.

325
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,960
There's a collared ewe coming out
towards the front.

326
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,280
When they've come round
at this sort of speed, they're going
to stick tight together.

327
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,440
That's the one he's going for,
the one you can see
in front of Glen there, I think.

328
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,480
They're really glued onto the dog.

329
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,720
Hey, hey, hey!

330
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,040
And you see how, how he's just
moving that little bit faster

331
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,960
and he's just not settling
these sheep.

332
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,200
Are they going to get out of
the ring? Wow, right to the edge!

333
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,720
Now he's got one on the end,
over on the left hand side.

334
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,920
Stay, stay.

335
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,520
This could be the moment
he's been waiting for.

336
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,160
And here!

337
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,840
They spring out. He asked the dog
in and he's come in.

338
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,640
But unfortunately
he's come on the two.

339
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,640
The other five have gone out of the
ring so this is going to cost him.

340
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,600
HE WHISTLES

341
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,360
Well sadly, after a cracking start,
Seamus and Glen

342
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,560
ran out of time
at the shedding ring,

343
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,760
leaving them with total score of 60.

344
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,840
Oh! Seamus.

345
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,440
Yes.

346
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,520
How frustrated were you when you
were standing in the shed there.

347
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,120
Yeah, it was difficult, eh?

348
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,400
He couldn't get a space
and it's one of those things.

349
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,480
Very, very frustrating.

350
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:30,480
Cos Glen did a fine job. At the
start you must have been thinking,
"This is going to be a breeze."

351
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,800
We started well, but cross drive,
the sheep were fighting a bit, so...
Yeah, well a disappointing round.

352
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,840
I'm so sorry. But well done.

353
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,080
Thank you again. OK. Thank you.

354
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,480
Thanks so much, Seamus.

355
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,120
Well a disappointing round for
Ireland there.

356
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,000
Next it's the competitor
who is going to try to keep England
in the lead.

357
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,640
It's Jim Cropper.
Let's find out more about him.

358
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,440
I'm Jim Cropper. This is my dog Dan. 

359
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,400
This is my farm,
it's in the Pennines.

360
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,480
HE WHISTLES COMMANDS

361
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,360
'50 or more years ago,
an old shepherd friend of mine'

362
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:13,960
used to take me gathering sheep and
I got so fascinated watching this
border collie bitch gather the sheep

363
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:19,040
I bought myself a dog then
and started to train it.

364
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,840
I got the bug.

365
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,320
It's become a...

366
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,760
..a part of my life.

367
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,880
# Here comes the girls... #

368
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,560
The two nieces, Chloe and Sophie,
come up to help us

369
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,040
and the granddaughter comes to help
with the pups.

370
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,920
But it's like nearly a family affair.

371
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,320
Come on!

372
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:44,200
Chloe, last year, won One Man And
His Dog and Sophie will be competing
this year in the junior section.

373
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,520
So hopefully she can do the same.

374
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,160
The things they have achieved
is marvellous and I feel really proud
of what they're doing.

375
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,520
Dan, he's worked on these hills
for seven years

376
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,360
and we have a good understanding.

377
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:05,280
I'm looking forward to
One Man And His Dog this year.

378
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,880
I like to try and put a performance
up what nobody else can beat.

379
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,280
Well here comes the granddaddy
of the sheep dog trialling world -
it's Jim Cropper.

380
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,360
Now, unfortunately, Jim's dog Dan
that we saw in the film there

381
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,480
has been retired from this
competition, he strained his leg

382
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,200
but this is Fleet. Yes, he might be
a substitute dog

383
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,080
but I've seen him run
and he's very, very capable.

384
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,200
Jim has represented England in the
national team over 30 times.

385
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,600
Also represented England over 20
times in the international team.

386
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,720
HE WHISTLES COMMANDS

387
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,040
And nicely behind the sheep.

388
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,920
Just quiet whistles.

389
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,880
Oh, this is a nice start.

390
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,720
19 for the out run.

391
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,600
Full marks for the lift.
10 out of 10.

392
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,320
As these sheep come over the rise
now to the side of the dog,

393
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,880
will Jim close the gap?

394
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,600
HE WHISTLES
Slightly left...

395
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,800
Oh, I think that's tactics,
you know.

396
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,120
I think that's the shallower part
to go over. Yep. He's a canny man!

397
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,880
MATT LAUGHS

398
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,560
At least the dog has
kept in contact with the sheep,
which is the main thing.

399
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,240
Well, it's worked. It's going very
well at the moment.

400
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,800
And through they go.

401
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,800
As these sheep come up the rise
and in to the handler's post...

402
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,800
Only a young dog.

403
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,120
But he's had a lot of success
with him.

404
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,160
Oh, nicely done! Made it look easy.

405
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,680
Just lost three points on the fetch.

406
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,720
17 out of 20 scored...

407
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,480
for Jim and of course for England.

408
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,040
That's the "walk on" whistle.

409
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,560
Fleet!

410
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,240
HE WHISTLES COMMANDS

411
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,600
The dog looking back
at the handler then.

412
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,920
Left down the flank now.
And fast round.

413
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,880
He's just a little bit tight there
and it's set them off at a speed.

414
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,440
Is he going to be able to recover
now on the cross drive?

415
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,240
Yeah, everything's looking good.

416
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,400
Yes, this is good.

417
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,320
Will he be fast enough?

418
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,080
He's asking him left now.

419
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,960
Asking him left again,
fast and you see how the dog
responded to the quicker whistle.

420
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,760
What about that! Lovely.

421
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,720
Beautifully done!

422
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,400
HE WHISTLES COMMANDS

423
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,200
Well that was a good drive.

424
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,960
26 points for Jim's drive.

425
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,200
Still plenty of time,
it's all about patience.

426
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,640
But as we've seen with Seamus,
time ticks away in here.

427
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,480
Here's a chance - one on the back.

428
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,280
Is he going for the back...
Oh, what a shame! What a shame!

429
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,640
Come on, Fleet.

430
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,960
Well this is a manouvre that
shepherds do in order to,

431
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,400
obviously, pair off one sheep
if they've got problems with their
feet or something like that,

432
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,400
so this is something that comes
straight off the farm, really, this.

433
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,920
There's a chance
of the back one coming.

434
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,280
Here it goes.

435
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,960
The dog's gone in.

436
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,400
Lay down. Lay down!

437
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,200
Lie down! And that's it.
There we are.

438
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,600
For a three-year-old dog, that was
very mature that, wasn't it? Yes.

439
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,240
A lot of dogs
would have gripped there.

440
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,400
Just four points awarded then
for the single.

441
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,320
Coming nice and steady as the sheep
come up the rise.

442
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,960
Now.

443
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,360
This man is usually good at penning.

444
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,680
Will the back two go in? No.
A bit of milling going on.

445
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:55,280
Thought we were going to get
one under the gate, but we haven't.
Another one coming out.

446
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,800
Fleet, do your bit!

447
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,280
Oh, that ewe!

448
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,840
She's went, "No, I'm not going to
fight. I'm going in. That's it."

449
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,000
What a super finish there.

450
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,920
Nine scored at the pen.

451
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,160
A wonderful round of 85.
And I tell you what,

452
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,960
Fleet certainly didn't let Jim
down there or England, and
their lead continues to build.

453
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,120
Very well done indeed.

454
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,320
You must have been beside yourself
in the shed, weren't you?

455
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,080
I thought they were never going to
come off, these two.

456
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,600
They were in the middle and
I couldn't get them
to change their minds.

457
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,720
Anyway, we got there in the end,
but...

458
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:37,120
85 scored. Oh!
So you're absolutely level pegging
with Alan Lloyd Jones from Wales.

459
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,400
So are you pleased with Fleet's
performance?

460
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,960
Yeah. He did well for a stand-in,
didn't he?

461
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,160
He really did.
It was a pleasure to watch.

462
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,440
Jim, thank you very much. I think
Sophie will be proud of you.

463
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,920
Oh, yeah. I'm proud of her as well.
Absolutely.

464
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:55,640
Well, Matt and Gus,
what did you make of that
magnificent singles competition?

465
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,840
Well, Kate, as predicted,
we knew it was going to be close,

466
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,520
but it was a real nail biter, Gus.

467
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:04,000
The first half of the competition
was all about this wobbly fetch.

468
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,240
Why were the sheep straying from
the perfect line?

469
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,320
Well when they came over the rise,
Stuart's dog unfortunately stayed
right the way back

470
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,600
and the sheep went well off line
and cost him a lot of points.

471
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,040
And then when it came to Alan, well
Alan, he'd seen what had happened

472
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,680
but he still got in a mess there

473
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,280
and his sheep went off line
but not as bad and
it didn't cost him as many.

474
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,560
The second half of the competition
was all about the shedding rig.

475
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,200
It was a real time sapper.
Let's talk about Seamus.

476
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,000
Was that really to do
with the character of the sheep?

477
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,520
It was really. They're young sheep,
they wanted to stick together,

478
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,160
they just would not split,

479
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,440
and although it was there
in plenty of time,

480
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,280
the opportunity never really came.

481
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,400
And Jim spent quite a lot of time in
there as well, didn't he? Yeah.

482
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,320
He only ended up with four points
for his shed,
but at least he did get his shed

483
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,040
and then went on to a successful
pen and finish.

484
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:56,280
That was certainly a nail-biting
competition.
You all impressed Matt and Gus.

485
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,680
Let's now confirm the results
of the singles round.

486
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,480
Joint winners were...

487
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,560
They both scored...

488
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,840
So how does that
affect the leader board?

489
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,200
Another stunning day of trialling,
but there's more to come.

490
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,680
Next time we've got the brace
competition -

491
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,680
a truly magnificent display
of shepherding prowess.

492
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,360
That's one man and two dogs.
Don't miss it.

493
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,640
Join us then from County Antrim.
