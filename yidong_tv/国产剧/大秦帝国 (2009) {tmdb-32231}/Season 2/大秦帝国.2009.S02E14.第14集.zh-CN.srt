8
00:00:12,242 --> 00:00:14,095
每位作家都离不开灵感

9
00:00:14,095 --> 00:00:14,875

要是你能打我  我会很开心

30
00:00:55,047 --> 00:00:56,273
我们走之前你整理床铺了吗

有人还睡过我们的床

亲爱的  你一定要这么大声吗

有人才刚起床
Some of us are still waking up.

40
00:01:17,184 --> 00:01:18,442
什么事情能让你这么兴奋

49
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:35,786
我该做的嘛
Ah, that's my job.

50
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,640
幸运的是  我没朋友会看报纸杂志

51
00:01:37,968 --> 00:01:39,147
有什么让你难堪的

等等  让我看看

在采访中我从来没说过这种话

贝克特探长不会喜欢这个的
Detective Beckett is not going to love this.

68
00:02:15,252 --> 00:02:17,340
也许她会一笑而过

69
00:02:17,674 --> 00:02:20,069
作为一个整天被女人包围的男人
How is it, for a man who is surrounded by women,

70
00:02:20,283 --> 00:02:21,760
你对女人怎么就毫无了解呢
that you know so little about us?

71
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,817
说曹操  曹操到
Speak of the devil.

她打电话来要么是有命案

96

父母的床太硬
That one was too hard,

97
00:03:29,228 --> 00:03:30,776
而熊宝宝的床正合适

-看来他挣扎过  -挣扎无效

Here. You see that? It's a needle mark from a syringe.

100
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:38,875
很可能因被注射某种药物
Probably was injected with something

101
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,870
致使他的心脏停止跳动

还有人溜进来用注射器杀人
And then someone sneaks in and kills him with a needle.

有人知道他们出城了吗
Did anyone know they were leaving town?

115
00:04:07,682 --> 00:04:09,500
只有同事  女儿的学校方面

121
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,530
为什么要拍照呢
Why would he take pictures?

122
00:04:24,871 --> 00:04:26,872
这样他才能物归原位
So he could put everything back the way he found it.

123
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:28,787
他希望没人发现他来过
He was hoping nobody would know that he was here.

124
00:04:29,086 --> 00:04:29,965
尽管他尽力了  还是差点儿  
Almost as though he was hiding.

125
00:04:30,255 --> 00:04:31,688
让技术部门查查记忆卡
All right, have a tech pull the memory card.

126

So, Castle, is it true? Are you finally off the market?

130
00:04:42,394 --> 00:04:43,754
你们俩  如果谁走漏半点风声
You guys, if either of you breathe a word of this...

131
00:04:44,296 --> 00:04:45,691
我发誓  我会让你们付出代价的
I swear, I will make you pay.

我已经都查过了
on everyone who knew the family was gonna be out of town.

136
00:04:54,222 --> 00:04:55,418
目前为止都无嫌疑
So far everyone's come back clean,

137
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:56,696
不过会继续查的
but I'm gonna keep digging.

138
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:57,235
查访的情况呢
Anything on the canvass?

139
00:04:57,486 --> 00:04:59,134
一无所获  这栋楼没有门卫
A whole lot of nothing. No doorman on the building.

140
00:04:59,385 --> 00:05:00,432
邻居们没有发现任何异常
None of the Dyson's neighbors noticed anything

141
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:01,923
仅仅是感到震惊  
out of the ordinary. 

142
00:05:01,923 --> 00:05:03,951
恐怖  我那地方住了八年了
Shocker. I've lived in my spot eight years.

143
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,305
一个邻居我也认不出
I couldn't pick my neighbors out of a lineup.

144
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,243
曼哈顿就是这样啊
Well, that's Manhattan for you.

145
00:05:06,658 --> 00:05:08,997
除非有直接关系  否则彼此都不认识
Nobody notices anything unless it affects them directly.

146
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:10,987
-除非上报  -失陪  贝克特
- Unless it's in the paper. - Excuse me. Beckett.

147
00:05:13,595 --> 00:05:14,313
好  好  很好
Great. Okay, good.

148
00:05:14,822 --> 00:05:16,231
通过死者指纹查到了
Got a hit off of John Doe's fingerprints.

149
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:17,941
道格拉斯・比谢普  在资料库里
Douglass Bishop. He's in the system.

150
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:22,492
道格拉斯・比谢普
Douglass Bishop...

151
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,703
十年前被捕过一次
Arrested once ten years ago--

152
00:05:25,437 --> 00:05:26,630
轻微罪  酒后闹事
misdemeanor drunk and disorderly.

153
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,704
后免于起诉  除此之外  算身家清白
Charges were dropped. Besides that, he's clean.

154
00:05:30,054 --> 00:05:30,857
好吧  通知亲属
All right, find the next of kin.

155
00:05:31,272 --> 00:05:32,871
他们认完尸  也许能告诉我们
After they I.D. the body, maybe they can tell us

156
00:05:33,096 --> 00:05:34,170
他到底在那间公寓干什么
what the hell he was doing in that apartment.

157
00:05:36,802 --> 00:05:38,450
从实验室得到结果
I got the results back from the lab.

158
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,087
他被注射了一种麻醉剂  氯胺酮
He was injected with an anesthetic--Ketamine.

159
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,092
K粉[毒品]  他死于俱乐部常用毒品
Special "K"? He was killed by a club drug?

160
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,327
那种剂量并不致死
Not in this dose.

161
00:05:45,937 --> 00:05:48,412
给死者注射毒品的人  可不是让他兴奋
Whoever shot up Mr. Bishop was not looking to get him high.

162
00:05:48,937 --> 00:05:50,174
那剂量足能灭了一匹马
Gave him enough to put down a horse.

163
00:05:52,522 --> 00:05:53,412
受害人的姐姐来了
The victim's sister is here.

164
00:05:54,357 --> 00:05:55,109
我是贝克特探长
I'm detective Beckett.

165
00:05:55,567 --> 00:05:56,320
感谢你们过来
Thank you so much for coming down.

166
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:58,918
真的是他吗
Is--is that him?

167
00:06:00,074 --> 00:06:00,976
真是道格吗
Is that Doug?

168
00:06:03,535 --> 00:06:04,750
所以警方需要你来确认
That's what we'll need you to verify.

169
00:06:13,901 --> 00:06:14,908
这根本不合理
None of this makes any sense.

170
00:06:15,215 --> 00:06:17,489
为什么道格要住别人家呢
I mean, why would Doug be living in these people's apartment?

171
00:06:17,764 --> 00:06:18,879
他在霍博肯市有自己的房子
He's got his own place out in Hoboken.

172
00:06:19,441 --> 00:06:21,487
有没有可能是你弟弟惹祸上身
Is it possible that your brother was in trouble,

173
00:06:21,701 --> 00:06:22,801
因此在躲避什么人
that he was hiding from someone?

174
00:06:23,308 --> 00:06:25,031
不会  道格是个受欢迎的人
No. Everybody loved Doug.

175
00:06:25,631 --> 00:06:26,689
他有没有欠人钱
Did he owe anybody money

176
00:06:27,098 --> 00:06:28,736
或者经济困难
or have any financial problems?

177
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,760
据我所知  没有
Not that I know of.

178
00:06:31,648 --> 00:06:33,957
他在旅行社的工作时间
I-I mean, his hours at the travel agency

179
00:06:34,343 --> 00:06:34,904
是缩短了
got cut back,

180
00:06:35,137 --> 00:06:35,929
但他还能过得去
But he was getting by.

181
00:06:36,677 --> 00:06:37,381
旅行社
Travel agency.

182
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:38,797
也许正因此他会知道
Maybe that's how he knew the

183
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:40,716
-戴森一家出城了  -但如果他遇到麻烦
- Dysons were out of town. - But if he were in trouble,

184
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:43,594
他可以动用潜水资金
he would've raided his scuba fund.

185
00:06:44,748 --> 00:06:46,626
他总是说  如果哪天时候到了
He was always saying that someday when his ship came in,

186
00:06:46,817 --> 00:06:48,313
就在牙买加给自己开...
he was gonna get himself a little--

187
00:06:48,685 --> 00:06:51,825
-一间潜水用品小店  -道格正为此攒钱
- a little scuba shop down in Jamaica. - Doug was saving up for it.

188
00:06:52,434 --> 00:06:54,436
每个月都把一部分工资
He would put a portion of his paycheck

189
00:06:54,717 --> 00:06:55,357
存入一个账户
in an account every month.

190
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,264
最后一次见你弟弟是什么时候
When was the last time you saw your brother?

191
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:59,754
上次的假期派对
Not since the holiday party.

192
00:07:01,113 --> 00:07:03,761
道格的旅行社在机场办的
Doug's agency threw it out by the airport,

193
00:07:03,761 --> 00:07:06,259
是斯坦工作的机场  所以我们都去了
which is where Stan works, so we all went.

194
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:09,634
人总是无法预料这种事
You just never think something like this is gonna happen.

195
00:07:10,098 --> 00:07:11,134
所以安排不了时间
So you don't make time.

196
00:07:12,323 --> 00:07:14,146
好  谢谢
Okay, thank you.

197
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:19,287
旅行社有点问题
That was the travel agency.

198
00:07:20,097 --> 00:07:21,450
如果道格在躲什么人
If Foug was hiding from someone,

199
00:07:21,712 --> 00:07:22,694
说明他工作不顺
he wasn't doing a very good job.

200
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:25,995
但昨天之前  他每天都上班
Apparently he hasn't missed a day of work until yesterday.

201
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,283
戴森家的旅行呢
What about the Dysons' trip?

202
00:07:27,611 --> 00:07:28,801
经手的是别家旅行社
They booked it through a different agency.

203
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,894
-潜水资金  -没动过
- The scuba fund? - Didn't touch it.

204
00:07:31,275 --> 00:07:34,098
所以他不是躲人  也没欠债
So he wasn't in hiding, he didn't owe anybody any money

205
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,518
而他又无法得知
and he had no discernible way

206
00:07:35,929 --> 00:07:38,539
-戴森一家何时出城  -贝克特
- of knowing when the Dysons would be out of town. - Hey, Beckett.

207
00:07:39,482 --> 00:07:41,599
电脑高手把死者相机记忆卡里
The geeks managed to pull the deleted photos from

208
00:07:41,776 --> 00:07:44,230
被删掉的照片复原了  想看吗
our squatter's memory card. Care to take a look?

209
00:07:45,192 --> 00:07:47,197
柜台  橱柜内部的照片
Stuff on counters, inside cabinets.

210
00:07:47,723 --> 00:07:48,630
不是在戴森家
That's not the Dysons' place.

211
00:07:49,447 --> 00:07:51,532
他以前也做过  只是在别人家
He's done this before, but in other apartments.

212
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:52,775
也许他只为求刺激
Maybe he does it for the thrill.

213
00:07:53,287 --> 00:07:54,653
也许有人发现了  火大了
Maybe someone found out and got mad.

214
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,618
但死者还是得知道屋主何时出门
But he'd still have to know when they were away.

215
00:07:59,643 --> 00:08:01,535
除非道格・比谢普并非借住人
Unless Doug Bishop isn't our squatter.

216
00:08:01,838 --> 00:08:03,061
那个肯定不是道格・比谢普
That's definitely not Doug Bishop.

217
00:08:04,368 --> 00:08:05,051
他是谁
Who is he?

218
00:08:06,436 --> 00:08:08,871
可能就是凶手
He's probably our killer.

219
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,122
什么变态
What kind of psycho pads 

220
00:08:17,326 --> 00:08:19,504
会给和凶器合影呢
Takes pictures of himself and his murder weapons? 

221
00:08:19,838 --> 00:08:20,895
有些凶手要留纪念品
Some killers keep trophies.

222
00:08:21,725 --> 00:08:23,641
为了自保  他的确把照片删了
In his defense, he did delete these photos.

223
00:08:24,645 --> 00:08:27,567
加消音器的45口径手枪  他要干什么
45 with a silencer. Wonder what he had lined up for this?

224
00:08:28,273 --> 00:08:28,761
干坏事
Nothing good.

225
00:08:29,105 --> 00:08:30,336
鉴证组套取了相机和
Has C.S.U. Pulled the prints off of the camera 

226
00:08:30,337 --> 00:08:31,460
私人物品上的指纹吗
and personal effects?

227
00:08:31,631 --> 00:08:32,853
是的  但不是道格・比谢普
Yeah, they don't match Doug Bishop 

228
00:08:32,854 --> 00:08:33,752
在资料库也找不到
and they're not in the system.

229
00:08:33,752 --> 00:08:34,930
即他没有案底
Which means he doesn't have a record.

230
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,634
那  如果道格不是借住
Well, if Doug wasn't our squatter,

231
00:08:36,786 --> 00:08:38,062
去戴森家里干什么
What was he doing in the Dysons' apartment?

232
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,195
他肯定认识那个借住人
He had to have known the squatter somehow.

233
00:08:40,201 --> 00:08:41,938
若这个借住者思维缜密
If this squatter was so meticulous

234
00:08:42,152 --> 00:08:43,349
比如要物归原处
Taking about putting things back, 

235
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,438
又怎会留下这个线索呢
why'd he leave all this for us to find?

236
00:08:44,475 --> 00:08:45,961
没错  这说不通
You're right. It--it makes no sense.

237
00:08:46,706 --> 00:08:50,364
什么  不杜撰些戏剧性理论吗
What? No grand theatrical theory to spin for us?

238
00:08:51,086 --> 00:08:52,022
说实话  没有
Honestly, I-I got nothing.

239
00:08:52,555 --> 00:08:54,262
更重要的是  我们没有任何线索
More importantly, we don't have any prints or leads.

240
00:08:54,998 --> 00:08:56,559
怎么揪出这个小鬼 
How are we gonna catch a ghost? 

241
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,241
找出他是怎样出入的
By finding out how he haunts.

242
00:08:58,652 --> 00:09:00,297
如果查处借住人是怎样知道
If we can figure out how the squatter knew

243
00:09:00,502 --> 00:09:01,584
目标要出城  
His marks were out of town, 

244
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:04,267
找出他与借住地的关系
find something that connects him to the other places that he stayed,

245
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:05,705
也许就能缩小范围
Then maybe we can narrow down the field.

246
00:09:06,283 --> 00:09:07,074
我们继续朝这个方向查
We'll keep going through these.

247
00:09:07,287 --> 00:09:08,758
顺利的话  就能发现线索
With any luck, we'll find something that can tell us

248
00:09:09,044 --> 00:09:11,097
-查到其他屋主  -很好  谢谢
- whose apartments these are. - Okay, great. Thank you.

249
00:09:23,757 --> 00:09:24,935
你在干什么
What are you doing?

250
00:09:25,217 --> 00:09:26,917
-查查昨晚比赛谁赢了  -我们
- I'm looking to see who won the game last night.  - Oh, we won.

251
00:09:27,676 --> 00:09:28,880
你知道我说的是什么比赛吗
Do you even know what game I'm talking about?

252
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,844
当然知道  年度重大比赛
Sure I do. The big game.

253
00:09:34,002 --> 00:09:34,920
好了  卡塞尔  怎么回事
Okay, Castle. What's going on?

254
00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:37,066
贝克特  看看这个
Yo, Beckett. Check this out.

255
00:09:37,656 --> 00:09:39,907
他给别人的药箱拍了照
He took a picture of the inside of someone's medicine cabinet.

256
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,528
处方药瓶上的名字几乎看得清
You can almost make out the name on these prescription bottles.

257
00:09:42,584 --> 00:09:43,460
让技术部看看这个
Have I.S. Take a look at it,

258
00:09:43,643 --> 00:09:44,961
看他们能否增加清晰度
See if they can enhance the photo.

259
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:51,522
老天
Oh, god.

260
00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:53,784
他翻遍了我的药箱
He went through my medicine cabinet?

261
00:09:54,897 --> 00:09:56,596
请别说他还看了我的日记
Please tell me he didn't go through my diary.

262
00:09:56,967 --> 00:09:57,889
我们不确定  兰福特女士
Oh, we're not sure, Ms. Langford.

263
00:09:58,206 --> 00:10:00,829
-你确定不认识他  -是的  很确定
- Are you sure you don't recognize him?  - Yeah, I'm positive.

264
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:03,380
-你也不认识戴森一家  -不认识
- And you don't know the Dysons?  - No.

265
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:06,005
只有我母亲知道我出城了
The only person that knew I was even out of town was my mother.

266
00:10:06,663 --> 00:10:07,952
大家都以为我请病假了
Everyone else thought I was on sick leave.

267
00:10:09,482 --> 00:10:11,011
你不会告诉我老板这个吧  是吗
You won't tell my boss that, will you?

268
00:10:11,537 --> 00:10:13,810
当你回来时  有没有发现异常
Did you notice anything unusual when you returned?

269
00:10:15,623 --> 00:10:16,755
我终于懂了
Oh, that totally explains it.

270
00:10:17,782 --> 00:10:18,272
怎么了 
What? 

271
00:10:18,273 --> 00:10:19,686
我的水龙头  几个星期了
My faucet. For weeks, 

272
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:22,108
一直催楼管来修漏水的水龙头  
I've been asking my superTo fix my leaky faucet,

273
00:10:22,109 --> 00:10:22,916
但他总不来
but he never came.

274
00:10:23,232 --> 00:10:24,918
当我回来后  修好了
And then when I got back, it was fixed.

275
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,773
我就以为他终于来了
So I just assumed that he finally did it,

276
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,751
但过后  我在楼梯上看到他
But then later, when I saw him on the stairs,

277
00:10:29,157 --> 00:10:30,820
他根本不知道我在讲什么
He didn't even know what I was talking about.

278
00:10:31,148 --> 00:10:32,553
借住的家伙修好了你的水龙头
The squatter fixed your sink?

279
00:10:33,195 --> 00:10:35,569
没错  冰箱里还有一瓶
Yeah. And there was this bottle of, um,

280
00:10:35,853 --> 00:10:37,930
奇怪的草莓香槟
Like weird strawberry champagne in the fridge.

281
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:40,689
我还以为是走前的派对后
And I just assumed that one of my friends had left it

282
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:44,383
某个朋友留下的  但是
During a dinner party I had before I left, but...

283
00:10:45,713 --> 00:10:46,945
我的朋友都不会买这样
None of my friends would've bought such a--

284
00:10:47,286 --> 00:10:48,664
-廉价的酒  -正是
- Cheap bottle of booze.  - Exactly.

285
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,238
他干了修理活
So he makes repairs,

286
00:10:51,748 --> 00:10:54,506
还给房主礼物  他是挺有风度的
Leaves hostess gifts-- he's the gentleman squatter.

287
00:10:54,976 --> 00:10:56,294
他杀了人  所以别把他说成
Who killed a man, so don't make him out to be

288
00:10:56,535 --> 00:10:57,363
年度贵客
The houseguest of the year.

289
00:10:58,114 --> 00:10:59,601
感谢你过来一趟  兰福特女士
Thank you for coming in, Ms. Langford. 

290
00:10:59,602 --> 00:11:00,066
顺便说一下
By the way,

291
00:11:00,756 --> 00:11:04,160
报纸上的照片可别介意
That photo in the paper, did you no justice.

292
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,758
真人帅过上镜
You're much better looking in person.

293
00:11:06,307 --> 00:11:07,432
报纸上有你的照片
There's a picture of you in the paper?

294
00:11:08,132 --> 00:11:09,602
那你就是探长女友
So are you the detective girlfriend?

295
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:11,667
很抱歉  你刚说什么
I'm sorry, the what?

296
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,055
他真是理想对象
He... is such a catch.

297
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:16,170
别
Don't.

298
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,350
给我看看  马上
Show me. Now.

299
00:11:19,814 --> 00:11:21,743
-"在恋爱中"  -"据传"
- "Romantically involved"?  - "Rumored to be."

300
00:11:21,817 --> 00:11:22,908
你说什么了
What did you tell them?

301
00:11:22,909 --> 00:11:25,091
什么也没有  我干嘛要这样做
Nothing! Why would I do that?

302
00:11:25,437 --> 00:11:27,039
你知道这多影响我的声誉吗
Do you have any idea what this does to my reputation?

303
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:29,370
你的声誉  那我的呢
Your reputation? What about my reputation?

304
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:31,820
我也很生气  我们是一条船上的
I am just as upset as you are. I'm on your team.

305
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,127
卑鄙的媒体
This is shoddy journalism,

306
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,613
我就差没取消订阅了
And I am two seconds away from canceling my subscription.

307
00:11:36,141 --> 00:11:37,068
-我的订阅  -你有没有想过
- My subscription.  - Do you have

308
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:40,195
做一名女警有多难吗
any idea how hard it is to be a female cop?

309
00:11:40,657 --> 00:11:42,028
我最不希望的就是  你爆猛料给
The last thing I need is for you to give them more ammo to

310
00:11:42,218 --> 00:11:43,554
是的  请接《纽约莱杰报》

你在做什么
What are you doing? 

312
00:11:44,594 --> 00:11:45,705
兰福特说只有她母亲知道
Langford said that the only person

313
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:48,160
她去旅游了  但真实情况并非如此
Who knew she was on vacation was her mother, but that's not true.

314
00:11:48,528 --> 00:11:50,164
如果真是装病
If she was actually pretending to be sick,

315
00:11:50,681 --> 00:11:51,832
她可不想让报纸在门前
The last thing she'd want is newspapers piling up

316
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:53,156
堆成小山  
at her front door.  

317
00:11:53,157 --> 00:11:53,983
她暂停订报了
She had the papers held.

就知道谁出门  还有去多久
Exactly who's out of town and for exactly how long.

321

Who am I? I... i...

324
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:13,761
-有时忘了自己不是警察  -我没忘
- I sometimes forget I'm not actually a cop. - I don't.

325
00:12:15,499 --> 00:12:17,615
你好  纽约警局凯特・贝克特探长
Hi. This is detective Kate Beckett with the NYPD.

326
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:18,970
请找你们主管接电话
I'd like to speak with your supervisor, please.

327
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,400
我不敢说他是否眼熟
I can't really say he looks familiar, 

328
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,315
你们得明白  我们有几百名员工
But you gotta understand, we have hundreds of employees.

329
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:25,769
那有多少人有权限
Well, how many of them had access

330
00:12:25,834 --> 00:12:26,969
了解假期暂停订阅信息

有十几人负责订阅事宜
Well, you got about a dozen in subscriptions,

332
00:12:30,106 --> 00:12:31,277
收费的也有些个
Another handful in billing,

333
00:12:31,563 --> 00:12:33,145
当然还有送报员
And, of course, the newspaperboys themselves.

334
00:12:34,028 --> 00:12:35,324
我要看看名单
I'm gonna need to see a list of their names.

335
00:12:36,685 --> 00:12:37,192
可以  跟我来

336
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:46,097
达娜
Donna.

337
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:48,939
理查德  你来这里做什么
Richard. What are you doing here?

338
00:12:49,763 --> 00:12:51,379
不是因为排第九生气了吧
Uh, you're not mad about number 9, are you?

339
00:12:51,794 --> 00:12:53,237
我跟编辑说了  还把你排第七的
I told my editor to keep you at 7.

340
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,178
不  不是那个  我不太在意
No, no, it's not that. I don't care about that... much.

341
00:12:56,556 --> 00:12:58,911
只是  你说我和贝克特探长在恋爱
It's--I just--why did you say I was dating detective beckett?

342
00:12:59,587 --> 00:13:01,558
我猜的
Oh. Well, I just assumed.

343
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:03,617
你采访时一直在谈论她
You kept bringing her up during the interview.

344
00:13:04,088 --> 00:13:04,985
不  我没有
No, I didn't.

345
00:13:04,986 --> 00:13:06,931
你有  你一直在谈论她
Sure you did. You went on and on about her.

346
00:13:07,636 --> 00:13:09,206
贝克特说最好笑是  那方面她最好
"Beckett said the funniest this, she's the best that."

347
00:13:10,077 --> 00:13:10,787
真的吗  我那样吗
Really? I did that?

348
00:13:11,195 --> 00:13:12,433
去年  你光聊自己
Last year all you did was talk about yourself.

349
00:13:12,669 --> 00:13:14,805
达娜  我完完全全是单身
Well, Donna, I am very, very single.

350
00:13:15,686 --> 00:13:17,944
真的吗  既然你们没恋爱
Really? Because if you aren't involved,

351
00:13:18,158 --> 00:13:19,933
排第三的未婚佳丽今早还问到你
Bachelorette number 3 asked about you this morning.

352
00:13:20,465 --> 00:13:22,768
你见到她了吗  没有
Did you see her? No?

353
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:25,823
你是不是连报纸的第一页都不看完
Or are you one of those people who never goes below the fold?

354
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:27,215
怎么会  我会看完第一页
Oh, I go below the fold.

355
00:13:27,626 --> 00:13:28,724
只是  最近忙着写
It's just, lately I've been very busy

找到一个符合的

360
00:13:43,719 --> 00:13:45,323
米齐・卡尔森  送报员
Mickey Carlson, delivery boy.

361
00:13:45,537 --> 00:13:46,318
戴森和米歇尔・兰福特
Both the Dysons and Michele Langford

362
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,868
-都是他的客户  -送报员  收到
- are on his route. - Delivery boy. Knew it.

363
00:13:49,321 --> 00:13:50,345
不管怎样  他今早没来
Anyway, he didn't show this morning.

364
00:13:50,626 --> 00:13:51,627
其他送报员帮他顶班
Another carrier had to cover.

365
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,772
申请表上没有地址
You know, there's no address on this application.

366
00:13:54,017 --> 00:13:55,287
-档案上还存有吗  -没有
- Do you have one on file?  - Nah.

367
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,100
他从没给过  我现在知道原因了
He never gave us one, and now I know why.

368
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:59,342
所以是  明天发薪水
It says there that payday is tomorrow.

369
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:01,614
是直接打到他账上  还是
Does Mickey do direct deposit or does--

370
00:14:01,861 --> 00:14:03,897
他来拿支票的  时间分毫不差
Pick up his own check? Like clockwork.

371
00:14:04,392 --> 00:14:05,796
工资表上午10点出
Payroll comes in at 10:00 in the morning,

372
00:14:06,334 --> 00:14:07,285
米齐10点零1分出现
Mickey's here at 10:01.

373
00:14:09,987 --> 00:14:10,469
送报员
A delivery boy

374
00:14:10,802 --> 00:14:12,348
居然有消音器和麻醉针剂
With a silencer and syringes full of ketamine?

375
00:14:13,037 --> 00:14:13,788
不管他到底是干什么的
His job's just a front

376
00:14:14,003 --> 00:14:15,099
这工作只是幌子
For whatever business he's really in.

377
00:14:16,206 --> 00:14:18,997
这是他的客户中暂停订阅的名单
Here's a list of all of the vacation holds on his route.

378
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:20,647
他可能借住在任何一家
He could be squatting at any one of them.

379
00:14:21,221 --> 00:14:23,492
他身上有枪  确保你们组高度戒备
He's armed, so make sure your teams use extreme caution.

380
00:14:24,116 --> 00:14:26,068
卡塞尔和我在报社埋伏  以防他出现
Castle and I will set up at the paper in case he shows.

381
00:14:26,418 --> 00:14:27,309
如果他在  肯定会抓住他
If he's out there, we'll find him.

382
00:14:27,536 --> 00:14:28,477
真讽刺
It's ironic, you know.

383
00:14:28,682 --> 00:14:30,887
申请暂定订阅不正是为防贼入室
People put in vacation holds to avoid break-ins. 

384
00:14:30,888 --> 00:14:31,769
这个反讽用的好
Good use of irony.

385
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,377
-报社里谁是你的朋友  -达娜・文森斯 
- So who's your friend at the paper?  - Oh, Donna Vncennes?

386
00:14:37,896 --> 00:14:39,226
就是她写的  我们在恋爱
Mm-hmm. She's the one who wrote the blurb about us.

387
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,040
-没有"我们"  -我知道
- There is no "Us."  - I know that.

388
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,404
-你解释给她听了吗  -是的
- Did you tell her that?  - Yes, I did,

389
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,685
真是有效  我颇有收获
Which worked out, actually, really well for me.

390
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,115
因为结果是
As it turns out,

对我很兴趣  想见我
Very interested in meeting me.

393
00:14:54,507 --> 00:14:56,170
一旦娱记知道她和我约会
Once the info-tainers get ahold of her with me,

394
00:14:56,594 --> 00:14:58,143
就会忘了你我的流言
They're gonna forget all about you and I.

395
00:14:59,095 --> 00:14:59,901
标题都能猜得到
I can just see the headlines now--

396
00:15:00,273 --> 00:15:03,039
金童玉女共进晚餐
"9 meets 3 at dinner for 2."

397
00:15:04,163 --> 00:15:04,739
信不信由你
Believe it or not,

398
00:15:04,982 --> 00:15:06,070
纽约城的许多女人
There's a lot of women in this town

399
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,399
都想和我谈恋爱
Who like the idea of being romantically linked to me.

400
00:15:21,676 --> 00:15:22,241
我没有生活了
I have no life.

401
00:15:23,103 --> 00:15:24,705
不  比谢普先生才死了
No, Mr. Bishop has no life. 

402
00:15:24,706 --> 00:15:25,921
所以才躺在这里
That's why he's on my table.

403
00:15:28,091 --> 00:15:28,474
我得约会
I need a date.

404
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:30,007
什么
What?

405
00:15:30,749 --> 00:15:33,201
约会  男人  男士
A date. A... guy. A... man.

406
00:15:34,364 --> 00:15:35,701
你老想给我拉红线
You're always trying to set me up with people.

407
00:15:35,896 --> 00:15:37,725
所以我来了  我去  有什么介绍
So here I am. I'm game. What do you got?

408
00:15:39,349 --> 00:15:39,891
好吧
Okay.

409
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,426
受什么刺激了
What's gotten into you?

410
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,432
工作太累了  我想做的就是回家  
I get so wrapped up in work, all I want to do is go home 

411
00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:46,720
可是家里很安静  我现在厌倦了安静
where it's quiet, and I'm so tired of quiet.

412
00:15:47,004 --> 00:15:48,850
我想要  喧闹
I want... loud.

413
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:51,586
好吧
Okay.

414
00:15:52,664 --> 00:15:54,364
给你个完美处方
I have the perfect prescription for you.

415
00:15:59,312 --> 00:15:59,889
布拉德克
Bradekker?

416
00:16:00,442 --> 00:16:02,168
不是  宝贝  是布拉德・戴克
No, no, baby. That's Brad Dekker.

417
00:16:02,577 --> 00:16:04,304
之前想介绍给你的消防员
That firefighter I wanted to set you up with.

418
00:16:04,938 --> 00:16:06,682
-他帅吗  -他可是去年
- Is he cute?  - He was Mr. July

419
00:16:07,123 --> 00:16:09,057
纽约消防员挂历上的七月先生
In last year's New York firefighters calendar.

420
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,365
七月啊
July.

421
00:16:12,086 --> 00:16:14,223
最帅的才能放在夏季
They always put the really hot ones in the summer months.

422
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:15,345
没错
Exactly.

423
00:16:16,432 --> 00:16:17,501
那我们约8点  怎样
Well, then should we say around 8:00?

424
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,990
好的  我也是
All right. Me, too.

425
00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:22,009
晚安  阿曼达
Good night, Amanda.

426
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,704
抱歉  错过晚饭了
Ahh. Sorry I missed dinner.

427
00:16:25,478 --> 00:16:26,429
如果你饿的话  还有乳蛋饼
There's quiche if you're hungry.

428
00:16:26,787 --> 00:16:29,137
好极了  很美味
Sweet. Or savory, actually.

429
00:16:29,942 --> 00:16:31,660
你今天过得怎么样
So... how was your day?

430
00:16:34,113 --> 00:16:35,469
说实话今天过得还真不错
I had a truly great day. 

431
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,940
上课中被叫到
I got pulled out of class

432
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,270
副校长办公室了
And called to the vice principal's office.

433
00:16:38,907 --> 00:16:40,625
-为什么 她想干什么  -不就是你
- Why? What did she want? - You.

434
00:16:41,714 --> 00:16:43,245
-这是她的号码  -她的号码
- Here's her number. - Her number?

435
00:16:43,562 --> 00:16:45,693
我的德语老师  芙劳琳・索内伯格
Oh, and my German teacher, Fraulein Sonnenberg,

436
00:16:46,014 --> 00:16:47,330
让我转告你一句德语  
Wanted me to tell you, auf deutsch,

437
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,228
"你很有魅力"
"Du hast sex-appeal."

438
00:16:49,768 --> 00:16:51,670
再过两年  她就能按长者菜单[有折扣]点餐了
She's two years from ordering off the senior menu,

439
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,705
不过这是她的号 
But here's her number, too. 

440
00:16:52,706 --> 00:16:54,464
芙劳琳・索内伯格
Fraulein Sonnenberg?

441
00:16:54,693 --> 00:16:54,995
嫌她太老吗  
Too old? 

442
00:16:54,995 --> 00:16:56,210
这样吧  我朋友斯隆怎么样
That's okay 'cause my friend Sloan

443
00:16:56,546 --> 00:16:57,702
认为你是"真命天子"
Thinks you're "Real choice."

444
00:16:58,474 --> 00:16:58,887
她今年17岁
She's 17, 

445
00:16:58,888 --> 00:16:59,991
不过还有三个月就到法定年龄了
but she'll be legal in 3 months.

446
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:02,156
你可以来个大小通吃
Hey. Maybe we could double.

447
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:06,155
你现在有些讨厌我了吗
Oh, you hate me a little bit right now, don't you?

448
00:17:06,743 --> 00:17:08,925
是有点点  贝克特怎么说
Just a little. What did Beckett say?

449
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,716
她应该没什么意见吧
Oh, I'm sure she'll be fine with it.

450
00:17:12,018 --> 00:17:13,052
甚至可能感到荣幸
Maybe even a little flattered.

451
00:17:16,081 --> 00:17:16,425
感到荣幸
Flattered?

452
00:17:17,492 --> 00:17:20,601
我还打算...吃些呢
I was gonna... Eat that.

453
00:17:22,806 --> 00:17:24,662
10点15了  米齐还没出现
10:15. Mickey's a no-show. 

454
00:17:24,663 --> 00:17:25,590
耐心点  卡塞尔
Patience, Castle.

455
00:17:26,997 --> 00:17:30,037
你听过德拉贡餐厅吗
Hey, have you ever heard of Drago?

456
00:17:30,691 --> 00:17:32,754
莱杰报评出的十大最浪漫餐厅之一
It's on the "Ledger's" Top ten most romantic restaurants.

457
00:17:33,357 --> 00:17:35,980
相当贵  几乎订不到位子
It's pricey and impossible to get a table,

458
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,195
除非你认识人
Unless you know someone.

459
00:17:38,107 --> 00:17:38,521
怎么了
Why?

460
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:39,967
我只是想找一个好点的地方
Just looking for a place to go.

461
00:17:40,932 --> 00:17:42,740
-去约会吗  -是  去约会
- What, like on a date? - Yes, on a date.

462
00:17:44,086 --> 00:17:45,990
-你看起来很吃惊  -怎么会
- Why do you sound so surprised? - No, I--

463
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,155
我只是
No, I just, uh,

464
00:17:47,156 --> 00:17:49,155
没想过你是会去德拉贡的人
never figured you for a Drago kind of girl.

465
00:17:49,473 --> 00:17:50,110
是吗  
Really? 

466
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,658
那你认为我是什么样的人  卡塞尔
And what kind of a girl do you figure me for, Castle?

467
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:54,257
我只是
I... it--

468
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:55,479
目标出现
Oh! There's your boy.

469
00:17:57,789 --> 00:17:58,574
米齐・卡尔森  我是
Mickey Carlson, I'm...

470
00:17:58,574 --> 00:18:00,170
站住
Hey!

471
00:18:06,381 --> 00:18:07,039
米齐・卡尔森
Mickey Carlson...

472
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:10,008
你因涉嫌谋杀道格拉斯・比谢普被捕
You're under arrest  for the murder of Douglass Bishop.

473
00:18:10,401 --> 00:18:12,268
这是你谋杀道格・比谢普的镉试剂
This is the cadimium that you used to kill Doug Bishop.

474
00:18:12,268 --> 00:18:13,818
不  不  这不是我的
Whoa. No, no, that's not mine.

475
00:18:13,819 --> 00:18:15,834
你很聪明  没用枪杀他
Pretty smart not using the gun, Mickey.

476
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,125
-那样的话会很麻烦  -这不是我的枪
-That would've been too messy. - That's not my gun.

477
00:18:18,406 --> 00:18:19,873
我发誓  我没杀人
Look, I didn't kill anybody. I swear.

478
00:18:20,069 --> 00:18:21,693
我没犯法  我只是借住在那里
I'm not a criminal, all right? I was just squatting there.

479
00:18:21,881 --> 00:18:23,434
从法律上说  借住也是犯罪
Well, technically, squatting is a crime.

480
00:18:23,698 --> 00:18:24,990
是的  与人无害的犯罪  
Yeah, a victimless crime, 

481
00:18:24,991 --> 00:18:25,979
我挺有礼貌的
especially the way I do it.

482
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,347
如果道格・比谢普不是你杀的
If you didn't kill Doug Bishop,

483
00:18:27,347 --> 00:18:29,445
他怎么会死在戴森家
then how did he end up dead in the Dysons' apartment?

484
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,579
肯定是住梅特兰家的家伙
The guy from the Maitlands' apartment must have killed him. 

485
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:33,056
梅特兰家
And who are the Maitlands?

486
00:18:33,056 --> 00:18:33,849
在去戴森家前
The people whose apartment 

487
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:34,990
我借住的那家
I stayed in before the Dysons.

488
00:18:35,486 --> 00:18:37,002
现在从头开始交待
Okay, why don't you start from the beginning,

489
00:18:37,002 --> 00:18:38,357
一件事也别落下
And take us through it from there?

490
00:18:38,856 --> 00:18:40,572
梅特兰家暂停订报一周
The Maitlands put a week hold on their paper,

491
00:18:40,572 --> 00:18:42,646
我琢磨着  他们住在东27街  
which I was psyched about, 'cause they live on east 27th,

492
00:18:42,933 --> 00:18:44,079
那里有许多超赞的印度餐馆
which has amazing indian restaurants.

493
00:18:44,317 --> 00:18:46,044
所以我撬了锁  就开始拍照
So I pick the lock, I start taking pictures

494
00:18:46,536 --> 00:18:48,305
走的时候才能物归原位
so I can return everything to its original state.

495
00:18:48,747 --> 00:18:49,420
拍照的时候
I'm taking pictures 

496
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:50,865
看到桌子上放着这些注射器
when I find these syringes on the table.

497
00:18:51,358 --> 00:18:52,512
觉得怪怪的  但是想
Kinda weird, but I'm thinking, 

498
00:18:52,513 --> 00:18:53,254
也许梅特兰家有人
maybe one of the Maitlands

499
00:18:53,503 --> 00:18:54,687
得了糖尿病什么的
must be diabetic or something, right?

500
00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:56,811
我就接着拍照  但突然想到
So I keep going. Then bam--it hits me.

501
00:18:57,144 --> 00:19:00,049
床上怎么会有加了消音器的枪
What's a gun with a silencer doing out on the bed?

502
00:19:00,422 --> 00:19:01,566
接下来  
And next to it, 

503
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:04,314
-我又发现好多工具  -工具
- I see all this gear. - Gear?

504
00:19:04,716 --> 00:19:05,510
登山装备
Mountain climbing equipment.

505
00:19:06,064 --> 00:19:07,584
我想  我看到太多了
At this point, I seen enough. 

506
00:19:07,585 --> 00:19:08,471
就打算离开
I decide to get outta there.

507
00:19:08,955 --> 00:19:10,380
我拿起东西  准备走人
But just as I'm grabbing my stuff,

508
00:19:10,794 --> 00:19:11,726
我听见门开了
I hear the door unlock.

509
00:19:12,307 --> 00:19:13,402
抓紧时间  躲进了衣橱
And I barely reach the closet in time.

510
00:19:13,956 --> 00:19:16,187
从缝隙中看见他们  有三个人
I could see 'em through the slats. It was three of 'em.

511
00:19:16,516 --> 00:19:18,620
他是其中一个  大众脸
It was, uh, this guy, a plain-looking dude

512
00:19:18,939 --> 00:19:20,883
还有个凶神面煞的杂种
And tough-looking S.O.B.

513
00:19:21,304 --> 00:19:23,575
他脸上有一道新月形的疤痕
Man, he had a scar on his face looked like a crescent moon.

514
00:19:24,712 --> 00:19:25,283
新月形
A crescent moon?

515
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,839
我知道有些夸张
I know, right? It's crazy.

516
00:19:27,223 --> 00:19:28,707
管他呢  接着他们走进里屋
Anyway, they head into the back.

517
00:19:28,931 --> 00:19:29,707
我抓紧这个空当
I take the opportunity

518
00:19:29,998 --> 00:19:31,724
拿着我的东西  离开了那个鬼地方
to grab my stuff and get the hell outta there.

519
00:19:31,956 --> 00:19:33,622
就到了戴森家 
I end up at the Dysons'. 

520
00:19:33,623 --> 00:19:34,932
把东西放下  我才缓过来
Take a load off, I get comfortable,

521
00:19:35,378 --> 00:19:36,735
不知什么时候  前门打开了
when outta nowhere, the front door opens,

522
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:38,691
他和他朋友进来了  
and him and his friend come in. 

523
00:19:38,692 --> 00:19:40,414
哪个  有新月疤的吗
Who, crescent-moon scar face?

524
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,307
不是  是那个大众脸
No, the--the other guy. The plain one.

525
00:19:42,536 --> 00:19:43,284
他们逮着我了 
They grab me and demand 

526
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:44,568
让我把手机还给他们
that I give them their phone back.

527
00:19:45,108 --> 00:19:46,365
手机  
Their phone? 

528
00:19:46,366 --> 00:19:48,163
你走的时候顺手牵羊了
Are you making this up as you go?

529
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:50,581
不  是这样的  我走的时候
No, no, no, see, in my race to get out of the Maitlands',

530
00:19:50,866 --> 00:19:51,787
不小心拿了他们中某人的外套
I must have grabbed one of their jackets,

531
00:19:51,955 --> 00:19:52,967
有个手机在里面  
which had their phone in it, 

532
00:19:52,968 --> 00:19:54,148
但不知道他们怎么找到我的
but I don't know how they knew.

533
00:19:55,223 --> 00:19:56,540
最新的手机有GPS  
Newer phones have GPS. 

534
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:57,727
他们可以在网上追踪
They could track it on the web. 

535
00:19:58,253 --> 00:20:00,551
我解释说我不是故意的  要还手机
Well, I didn't want their phone and I tried to give it back.

536
00:20:00,925 --> 00:20:02,538
但是他们拿出一支注射器  
The guy pulls out a syringe 

537
00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:03,283
正准备给我注射
and is ready to stab me with it.

538
00:20:03,564 --> 00:20:05,637
真得感谢道格
But thank god for Doug. Oh, man.

539
00:20:06,242 --> 00:20:07,725
他说  "我可不想成为杀人犯"
Doug says, "I didn't sign up for murder."

540
00:20:08,511 --> 00:20:09,596
他们便开始争论  
Then they start arguing, 

541
00:20:09,597 --> 00:20:10,924
接着拿注射器的家伙说
and then the syringe guy says,

542
00:20:11,264 --> 00:20:13,994
"这里有三毫升  他看到太多了 " 
"We've got 3 mil on the line. He's seen too much."

543
00:20:14,628 --> 00:20:15,821
接下来他们就打起来了
Next thing I know, they're fighting.

544
00:20:16,614 --> 00:20:18,179
我就趁机逃跑了  
So I ran outta there. 

545
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:18,875
我只想说
I'm just saying,

546
00:20:19,123 --> 00:20:21,226
真是个不错的故事  你觉得呢
it's a really good story. Come on.

547
00:20:21,531 --> 00:20:23,795
一群奇怪的坏蛋  新月形疤痕
mysterious bad guys, crescent-shaped scars,

548
00:20:24,007 --> 00:20:24,647
躲在衣橱里
hiding in a closet? 

549
00:20:24,647 --> 00:20:27,684
听起来像小说  因为可能就是小说
It sounds like fiction because it probably is.

550
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,369
太糟糕了  他是个不错的人
Well, that's too bad. He's a nice guy.

551
00:20:29,754 --> 00:20:30,574
杰弗里・达默[食人连环杀手]也不错
So was Jeffrey Dahmer.

552
00:20:30,574 --> 00:20:31,906
从未停止食人事业
Didn't stop him from eating people.

553
00:20:33,578 --> 00:20:34,597
梅特兰家查得如何
Where are we on these Maitlands?

554
00:20:34,907 --> 00:20:35,595
他们在一艘游轮上
They're on a cruise ship, 

555
00:20:35,595 --> 00:20:37,409
已经让游轮安保部门去找他们了
but we're getting the ship's security to track 'em down right now.

556
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:38,658
尽快找到他们
All right, have 'em track faster.

557
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:39,781
需要他们的许可才能进去看看
I need their permission to get into the place.

558
00:20:39,932 --> 00:20:40,628
难道不能申请搜查令吗
Can't we just get a warrant?

559
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:42,757
因为杀人嫌犯的片面之词吗
On the word of a possible murder suspect?

560
00:20:42,932 --> 00:20:45,201
算不得正当理由
Not exactly probable cause.

561
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,655
不过一旦证实卡尔森先生是编故事
But once we disprove Mr. Carlson's story,

562
00:20:47,655 --> 00:20:48,979
我们会以谋杀罪起诉他
We'll be able to press charges for murder.

563
00:20:52,865 --> 00:20:53,231
你好  我是贝克特
Beckett.

564
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,026
你好  布拉德
Oh, hi, Brad.

565
00:20:56,305 --> 00:20:59,210
不  不  不算仓促
Uh, uh, no. No, no, no, it's not too last-minute.

566
00:20:59,408 --> 00:21:01,040
事实上  我今晚没安排
Actually, my plans for tonight just fell through.

567
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:03,800
布拉德是谁
Who's Brad?

568
00:21:04,365 --> 00:21:05,833
应该是蕾妮的朋友
Mm. Must be Lanie's friend.

569
00:21:06,093 --> 00:21:07,136
你们认识吗
You know him?

570
00:21:07,136 --> 00:21:08,973
是  见过一次  挺优秀的
Yeah, met him once. Good guy.

571
00:21:10,286 --> 00:21:11,336
消防员
Fireman. 

572
00:21:11,362 --> 00:21:14,432
上过纽约消防局日历  外表英俊
He was in the F.D.N.Y. Calendar. Chiseled good looks.

573
00:21:15,754 --> 00:21:16,537
腹肌相当结实
Rock-hard abs.

574
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,810
据说  有一次救火
Oh, and get this-- once during a fire,

575
00:21:19,334 --> 00:21:21,070
他救完一家人后
after saving the parents and the kids,

576
00:21:21,795 --> 00:21:23,979
为了救小狗  他又冲进火里
he went back in for the puppies.

577
00:21:24,885 --> 00:21:25,416
那到时见  
See you then. 

578
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:26,479
她是在玩头发吗
Did she just flip her hair?

579
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:28,576
老兄  你在听我说吗  小狗
I'm telling you, bro, puppies...

580
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,744
-他每次都会救  -小狗
- Gets 'em every time. - Puppies.

581
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,540
你好  是梅特兰先生吗
Yes, Mr. Maitland?

582
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:36,904
怎么了
What?

583
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,378
-你竟然在笑  -那又怎样
- You're smiling. - So?

584
00:21:40,143 --> 00:21:42,517
再见  找到梅特兰一家了
Good-bye. Hey. We got the Maitlands.

585
00:21:42,814 --> 00:21:43,399
可以进屋查探了
We're good to enter.

586
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:44,849
他们正在联系楼管
They're calling the super right now.

587
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:45,420
好的  行动吧
Okay, let's go.

588
00:21:51,637 --> 00:21:52,239
先生  请止步
Stay out here, please sir.

589
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,439
-我们去里屋  -好的
- We'll check the back. - Okay.

590
00:22:05,452 --> 00:22:05,873
好吧  我们期待吧
Well, surprise, surprise.

591
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,304
没东西能证实米齐的话
Nothing here to verify Mickey's version.

592
00:22:08,862 --> 00:22:09,580
来看看这里
Oh, wow. Look at this.

593
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:12,529
发现什么了吗
Did you find something?

594
00:22:12,905 --> 00:22:14,262
是的  老式的餐馆升降机
Yeah, it's an old-fashioned dumbwaiter.

595
00:22:14,476 --> 00:22:15,560
现在再看不到这些东西了
You don't see these around anymore.

596
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,454
真有才 
Genius, too. 

597
00:22:16,455 --> 00:22:17,540
梅特兰家把它改成了
The Maitlands have converted it

598
00:22:17,758 --> 00:22:19,325
可藏式音响组合橱
Into a hidden stereo component cupboard.

599
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,269
我敢说一定有个遥控器
I bet they have an R.F. Remote somewhere.

600
00:22:21,892 --> 00:22:23,305
我们不是来参观的  卡塞尔
We're not here to admire the place, Castle.

601
00:22:23,869 --> 00:22:26,214
怎么能不参观啊  看看这屋子
How can you not? I mean, look at this place.

602
00:22:26,644 --> 00:22:29,417
这间是19世纪末的战前公寓
This apartment is prewar, late 1800s.

603
00:22:29,695 --> 00:22:30,985
看看这墙裙
Oh, you see this molding?

604
00:22:31,788 --> 00:22:33,565
是原木造的  太华丽了
That is the original wood. Gorgeous.

605
00:22:34,316 --> 00:22:35,478
我敢说  浴室肯定是大理石墙板
I bet the bathrooms have marble wainscoting.

606
00:22:36,115 --> 00:22:37,867
你真是个都市型男
You're such a metrosexual.

607
00:22:38,074 --> 00:22:39,642
总好过日历型男[还有娘娘腔的意思]
Yes. Well, better than being a pinup boy.

608
00:22:41,174 --> 00:22:42,038
你听说了  
So you heard? 

609
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:43,480
卡塞尔  他是上过日历
And it's pinup man, Castle.

610
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:45,005
英俊.....的男人
Pinup... man.

611
00:22:45,537 --> 00:22:47,036
好吧  和你的消防员玩得开心
Yes. Well, have fun with your hose jockey

612
00:22:47,334 --> 00:22:48,777
而我将要和纽约排名第三的
Whilst I go out with New York's

613
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,704
单身佳丽约会去
Most eligible bachelorette number 3.

614
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,687
我倒是觉得她有些委屈
Oh, I guess that means she must be slumming it,

615
00:22:54,284 --> 00:22:56,581
她排第三  而你才第九
Her being number 3 and you being a lowly number 9.

616
00:22:57,087 --> 00:22:58,068
那你排多少呢
What number were you again? 

617
00:22:58,389 --> 00:23:00,207
没有异况
Place is clear.

618
00:23:01,352 --> 00:23:02,853
没有枪  没有氯胺酮
No gun, no ketamine, 

619
00:23:02,854 --> 00:23:03,755
也没什么登山工具
no mountain climbing equipment.

620
00:23:04,353 --> 00:23:05,332
什么都没有
There is nothing here.

621
00:23:05,787 --> 00:23:06,272
不  那里有
Yes, there is.

622
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:09,237
冷藏箱  19世纪末期使用
An icebox, circa late 1800s.

623
00:23:10,046 --> 00:23:11,093
看见没  
You see, before the invention

624
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:12,719
在家用电冰箱发明之前
Of modern household refrigeration,

625
00:23:13,233 --> 00:23:15,366
人们把易坏物品放到这个有冰块的
People used to keep their perishable items in a box

626
00:23:15,831 --> 00:23:16,410
箱子保鲜
That held ice.

627
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:18,441
所以这是一个  冷藏箱  
Hence--an icebox. 

628
00:23:18,442 --> 00:23:20,111
我说了这不是参观日  卡塞尔
It's not an open house, Castle.

629
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:22,230
梅特兰家真是太有才了
Oh, the Maitlands were very clever.

630
00:23:22,547 --> 00:23:23,929
他们把这里改成碗橱了
They converted this into a cupboard.

631
00:23:24,393 --> 00:23:26,762
刚好靠近电冰箱
Meanwhile, it's right next to their fridge--aah!

632
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:34,607
太出乎意料了
I did not expect that. 

633
00:23:34,608 --> 00:23:35,749
新月型的疤痕
Crescent-shaped scar.

634
00:23:38,151 --> 00:23:39,949
看来米齐的故事有些可信了
Looks like there was some truth to Mickey's tale after all.

635
00:23:43,573 --> 00:23:45,272
他叫安东・弗朗西斯
His name is Anton Francis. 

636
00:23:45,273 --> 00:23:46,372
这位弗朗西斯先生
Mr. Francis here,

637
00:23:46,681 --> 00:23:48,455
人完全可以貌相
not wanting to waste such a sinister looking scar

638
00:23:48,934 --> 00:23:49,997
真是无恶不作
decide to round out the stereotype

639
00:23:50,323 --> 00:23:51,961
他已数案在身
with a laundry list of criminal activity,

640
00:23:52,214 --> 00:23:53,868
包括入室偷窃
including fencing stolen property,

641
00:23:54,116 --> 00:23:55,748
多起持枪抢劫以及一起砸窗抢劫
stickups and a smash and grab.

642
00:23:56,026 --> 00:23:56,883
-死亡时间呢  -大概是
- Do we have time of death? - Yes,

643
00:23:57,072 --> 00:23:58,773
今天凌晨1点到4点间
between 1:00 and 4:00 a.m. this morning,

644
00:23:59,069 --> 00:23:59,872
这就排除了米齐・卡尔森的作案可能
which rules out Mickey Carlson.

645
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:02,417
刚查证他昨晚在一间避难所过夜
We verified that he stayed in a homeless shelter last night.

646
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:03,870
如果米齐说的是真话  
So if Mickey was telling us the truth,

647
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:05,018
那么道格和弗朗西斯
then Doug and Mr. Francis

648
00:24:05,217 --> 00:24:06,755
很明显没预料到内讧
clearly got more than they bargained for.

649
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,483
所有的一切都是他们的同伙做的
All by the murderous hand of their partner--

650
00:24:09,788 --> 00:24:11,268
即用氯胺酮杀死道格的人
the guy who killed Doug with the syringe--

651
00:24:12,268 --> 00:24:15,443
-神秘的第三人  -找出安东的
- our mysteriou is 3rd man. - Let's get photos of

652
00:24:15,661 --> 00:24:17,726
所有朋友和监狱室友的照片
all of Anton's known associates and former cell mates.

653
00:24:18,196 --> 00:24:19,028
如果米齐看到
If Mickey saw his face,

654
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:20,719
他应该能认出来的
he should be able to I.D. him for us.

655
00:24:21,486 --> 00:24:23,195
身家清白的道格拉斯・比谢普
So how does a man like Douglass Bishop--

656
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:24,279
是如何与惯犯
with no criminal record--

657
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:25,941
搞在一起的呢
get involved with hardened criminals?

658
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,860
很简单  他们需要他
Simple. They needed him.

659
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,896
我认为  案发时梅特兰一家的出城
It seemed convenient to me that the Maitlands were out of town

660
00:24:30,896 --> 00:24:33,106
过于巧合  于是查了查
when all this went down, so I did some digging.

661
00:24:33,106 --> 00:24:34,451
发现他们拿到的船票
Turns out that cruise they're on,

662
00:24:34,452 --> 00:24:35,864
是在比赛中赢的
they won it in a contest.

663
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,764
而所谓的比赛根本不存在
Only there is no contest.

664
00:24:38,945 --> 00:24:40,054
伪造的中奖函
A phony award letter?

665
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,410
是的  当他们拿到中奖函和船票
Yeah, when they got that and the tickets,

666
00:24:42,418 --> 00:24:44,280
他们就想  馅饼不捡白不捡
they figured, why look a gift horse in the mouth.

667
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:45,587
猜猜船票哪来的
So guess where the tickets came from.

668
00:24:46,883 --> 00:24:47,956
道格・比谢普的旅行社
Doug Bishop's travel agency.

669
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:49,650
船票只是为了骗
So the cruise was just a scam

670
00:24:49,912 --> 00:24:50,811
梅特兰一家出城
to get the Maitlands out of town.

671
00:24:50,952 --> 00:24:53,615
中奖函说游轮本周出发
The letter says that the cruise had to be this week.

672
00:24:53,923 --> 00:24:55,915
-为何是本周  -为何是梅特兰一家
- Why this week? - And why the Maitlands?

673
00:24:56,031 --> 00:24:58,033
除非这些坏家伙就是喜欢战前建筑物
Well, unless our bad guys are into prewar architecture,

674
00:24:58,273 --> 00:25:00,000
那间公寓里没有值钱东西
there's really nothing in that apartment that's worth anything  

675
00:25:00,077 --> 00:25:01,715
除了那套音响组合
except for the audio/visual equipment,

676
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,816
-但还在呢  -为何要大费周张
- which was still there. - Why go through so much trouble

677
00:25:03,816 --> 00:25:05,271
进入梅特兰家
to get in the Maitlands' apartment?

678
00:25:05,718 --> 00:25:09,068
或许他们的目标不在梅特兰家
Maybe what they wanted wasn't in the Maitlands' apartment.

679
00:25:09,177 --> 00:25:10,592
或许打劫对象是别家
Maybe they were gonna rob someone else,

680
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:11,745
只是需要从这里进去
But just needed access.

681
00:25:11,748 --> 00:25:13,095
音响组合
The audio/visual equipment.

682
00:25:15,087 --> 00:25:16,142
就是入口
Access.

683
00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:20,238
梅特兰家在二楼
The Maitlands live on the second floor.

684
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:23,395
音响组合的正下方
Running perpendicular to them and whatever's below

685
00:25:23,395 --> 00:25:25,033
是老式升降机通道
is the old dumbwaiter shaft.

686
00:25:25,276 --> 00:25:27,421
在《风暴集结》我安排德里克・斯道姆
In "Gathering Storm," I had Derrick Storm

687
00:25:27,421 --> 00:25:30,457
爬进升降机通道  以躲开捷克杀手
climb up the dumbwaiter shaft to bypass the Czech assassin

688
00:25:30,457 --> 00:25:32,212
救出瑞士大使的女儿
in order to save the Swiss ambassador's daughter.

689
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:34,799
或许罪犯们是利用升降机
Maybe our bad guys are using the dumbwaiter

690
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,246
躲开下面的保安
to bypass the security of whatever's below them.

691
00:25:36,339 --> 00:25:39,077
这也解释了为何会有绳索和登山装备
Which would explain the ropes and the climbing gear.

692
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:41,713
那么  梅特兰家楼下是什么呢
So what's below the Maitlands' apartment?

693
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:44,614
宠物店
A pet shop.

694
00:25:45,434 --> 00:25:47,686
为何不来店里看一看它们
Why don't you come down and have a look at them?

695
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:50,018
城里的爬行动物  我这里选择最多
I have the largest selection of reptiles in the city.

696
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,597
只有我们店才有
They're my specialty.

697
00:25:53,001 --> 00:25:53,437
很乐意
My pleasure.

698
00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:56,205
好  谢谢  再见
Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye.

699
00:25:57,515 --> 00:26:00,202
二位好  有什么能效劳的吗
Ah, how is it? Can I, uh, can I help you?

700
00:26:00,814 --> 00:26:02,119
你确定没丢东西
And you're sure nothing was stolen?

701
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,976
是的  我说  有什么可偷的
Ya. I mean, what is there to steal?

702
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,262
升降机通道是最近被打开的
This dumbwaiter has been opened recently.

703
00:26:09,863 --> 00:26:10,316
打开了吗
It was open?

704
00:26:10,914 --> 00:26:13,589
米齐说  那三人说  有几百万保不住了
Mickey told us his attacker said there was millions at stake.

705
00:26:13,847 --> 00:26:15,728
杜・普利先生  隔着墙是什么
Mr. Du Preez, What's on the other side of that wall?

706
00:26:15,743 --> 00:26:17,959
第28大街  东区信托银行
28th STREET. EASTSIDE BANK AND TRUST.

707
00:26:18,378 --> 00:26:19,031
银行抢劫
A bank heist.

708
00:26:19,785 --> 00:26:21,904
看起来是计划打通后墙
It looks like the plan was to cut into the back wall

709
00:26:21,945 --> 00:26:23,903
进入另一边的银行保险库
to get into the bank vault on the other side.

710
00:26:23,918 --> 00:26:25,265
我们已通知银行经理  联调局
We called the bank manager, the FBI,

711
00:26:25,311 --> 00:26:27,968
-但疑犯并没下手  -出了什么问题
- But our guys never made it that far. - What went wrong?

712
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:31,384
不知道  可能是因为贪婪  恐惧
We don't know. It could've been greed, panic.

713
00:26:31,897 --> 00:26:34,645
好像是死者的同伙
It looks like our victims might have been betrayed 

714
00:26:34,646 --> 00:26:35,475
背叛了他
by their partner.

715
00:26:35,475 --> 00:26:37,863
过去  拿了钱才会杀同伙
In the old days, you killed your partners after you got the money.

716
00:26:38,023 --> 00:26:39,674
神秘的第三人有头绪吗
Any leads on this, uh, third man?

717
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,650
没有  给借住人看了照片
No. We had our squatter take a look at mug shots

718
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:44,971
辨认安东・弗朗西斯的同伙  但没结果
Of Anton Francis' associates, and we didn't find him.

719
00:26:44,977 --> 00:26:46,237
如果这第三人不是通过刀疤脸
What if the connection to the third man

720
00:26:46,256 --> 00:26:47,226
接应的
isn't through scar face?

721
00:26:47,256 --> 00:26:49,028
-而是通过道格呢  -旅行社
- What if it's through Doug? - The travel agent?

722
00:26:49,028 --> 00:26:50,225
不是查得一清二楚了吗
I thought we went through him.

723
00:26:50,226 --> 00:26:53,039
没错  查了他的家人朋友和同事
We did. We checked his family, his friends, his coworkers.

724
00:26:53,092 --> 00:26:54,224
可没查他的客户
But not his clients.

725
00:26:54,227 --> 00:26:55,346
你想啊  或许就是客户
Think about it. Maybe that's it.

726
00:26:56,191 --> 00:26:58,225
这第三人通过道格订票
The third man books a trip through Doug.

727
00:26:59,005 --> 00:27:01,995
道格开始向他讲述自己的梦想
Doug starts talking, tells him about his dream

728
00:27:02,093 --> 00:27:03,599
在岛上拥有自己的潜水用品商店
of owning a scuba shop in the islands.

729
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:06,360
神秘人感觉到他的挫败  拉他入伙
The third man senses his frustration. That's his in.

730
00:27:06,482 --> 00:27:08,511
他告诉道格事情很容易
He tells Doug it'll be easy.

731
00:27:08,968 --> 00:27:10,587
利己不损人  没人有损失
It's a victimless crime, nobody will get hurt,

732
00:27:10,674 --> 00:27:11,905
保险公司会赔偿
Insurance will pay,

733
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:14,243
神秘人心里清楚  如果警察调查
knowing the whole time, if the police investigate,

734
00:27:14,322 --> 00:27:17,191
会追踪到道格  而不是他
they'll track the tickets back through to Doug, not to him.

735
00:27:17,229 --> 00:27:19,286
只要道格一死
The third man remains invisible

736
00:27:19,286 --> 00:27:21,280
-神秘人就蒸发了  -算是合理
- so long as Doug is dead. - That almost makes sense.

737
00:27:21,345 --> 00:27:24,536
查查道格最近半年的客户名单
Let's run Doug's client list for the past six months.

738
00:27:24,568 --> 00:27:26,645
-如有可疑人物  拿给米齐认认  -好
- If anything pops, we'll show it to Mickey. - Okay.

739
00:27:26,887 --> 00:27:29,369
或许今晚应该取消
You know, maybe I should cancel tonight.

740
00:27:29,676 --> 00:27:30,510
他冒了生命危险救狗
You're gonna cancel on the guy

741
00:27:30,727 --> 00:27:32,510
你还要放人家鸽子
that risked his life for a bunch of puppies?

742
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,567
长官  你知道我的约会
Sir, you know about my date?

743
00:27:34,056 --> 00:27:36,535
是的  不管你会怎么想
Yes, and--and despite what you might think,

744
00:27:36,745 --> 00:27:37,570
你消失一晚
The world's not gonna end

745
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:38,788
地球不会不转的
just because you disappear for a night.

746
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,397
就算你不在  我肯定他俩能应付
And if it does, I'm sure that those two can handle it.

747
00:27:43,089 --> 00:27:45,017
-是的  去吧  -是啊  我要加班
- Yeah. Go ahead. - Yeah, I need the overtime.

748
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:48,019
那有消息立即通知我
Okay, but call me if anything turns up.

749
00:27:48,019 --> 00:27:49,307
好好好  玩得开心点
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Have fun.

750
00:27:50,592 --> 00:27:53,022
看她像是要取消约会吗
You see how ready she was to cancel on that date?

751
00:27:53,128 --> 00:27:54,831
跟你有什么关系  卡塞尔  
What's it to you, Castle? 

752
00:27:54,832 --> 00:27:56,195
是啊  你管那么多呢
Yeah, why do you care?

753
00:27:56,293 --> 00:27:58,292
随便说说  关心一下...
I'm just sayin'. Look out 'cause, uh...

754
00:28:04,926 --> 00:28:05,514
都不好
Neither of those.

755
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:08,275
看这个
Mm. Look.

756
00:28:10,733 --> 00:28:11,371
这个好
Oh, you're good.

757
00:28:14,546 --> 00:28:16,950
我知道你会觉得奇怪
I know that this can be weird for you,

758
00:28:17,527 --> 00:28:20,675
-父母不该去约会  -我知道你去约会  爸爸
- How parents aren't supposed to date. - I know you date, dad.

759
00:28:21,249 --> 00:28:22,139
还知道你可能会做其他事
I know you probably do other things

760
00:28:22,421 --> 00:28:23,729
那个我可懒得想
that I am not going to think about,

761
00:28:23,922 --> 00:28:25,981
过去将来  我们都不会提及此事
And that we'll never, ever mention.

762
00:28:26,585 --> 00:28:28,433
行  怎么了
Fair enough. So... what's wrong?

763
00:28:30,226 --> 00:28:30,968
不知道
I don't know.

764
00:28:30,968 --> 00:28:32,547
我没法一直在你身边
I mean, I'm not gonna be here forever.

765
00:28:32,547 --> 00:28:34,048
到时候谁照顾你呢
And then who's gonna look after you then,

766
00:28:34,215 --> 00:28:35,885
排名第三的未婚佳丽
bachelorette number 3?

767
00:28:36,753 --> 00:28:37,301
且慢
Slow down there.

768
00:28:38,032 --> 00:28:40,091
不会这么快就买戒指吧
Let's not go buying rings anytime soon.

769
00:28:40,181 --> 00:28:41,730
-只是个约会  -我知道
- It's just a date. - I know.

770
00:28:42,026 --> 00:28:43,829
她看起来不错  不过...
And she seems nice and all, but... 

771
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,078
如果挑选约会对象
if that's who you date,

772
00:28:45,092 --> 00:28:46,485
我是说  你真的只和
I mean, are you really gonna find happiness

773
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:49,118
上了榜的人追求幸福吗
with the kind of person who's a number on a list?  

774
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:49,725
已然如此
Well, I already have.

775
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,130
你是我个人名单上的冠军
You're number one on mine.

776
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:55,138
关心你是我的责任
Look, it's my job to worry about you,

777
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:56,150
不能倒过来
not the other way around.

778
00:28:57,346 --> 00:28:58,462
-我很好  -是啊
-I'll be fine. -Yeah.

779
00:28:58,518 --> 00:29:01,412
你准备炸火鸡时也这么说的
That's what you said when you tried to deep-fry a turkey.

780
00:29:02,132 --> 00:29:02,934
我们都记得结果如何
And we all know how that turned out.

781
00:29:04,313 --> 00:29:05,173
我只是不想你受伤
I just don't want you to get hurt...

782
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:09,101
或再一次燎了你的眉毛
or burn your eyebrows off... again.

783
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,113
很高兴眉毛又长了出来
I'm glad they grew back.

784
00:29:16,648 --> 00:29:17,412
终于长得一样了
They're finally matching.

785
00:29:26,969 --> 00:29:28,796
听说这里订不到位子
I've heard this place is impossible to get into.

786
00:29:29,123 --> 00:29:29,573
借过
Excuse me.

787
00:29:29,826 --> 00:29:31,983
-里克  -弗朗克  过来
- Ricky. - Frankie! Come here.

788
00:29:32,493 --> 00:29:34,071
-真高兴又见面了  -是啊
- It's nice to see you again. - And you.

789
00:29:34,323 --> 00:29:35,824
你们的位子马上就好
Um, your table will be ready momentarily.

790
00:29:36,412 --> 00:29:36,729
卡塞尔
Castle?

791
00:29:41,206 --> 00:29:41,800
贝克特
Beckett?

792
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,603
-我猜你们是认识的  -是的
- I take it you two know each other? - Uh, yeah.

793
00:29:47,378 --> 00:29:49,536
布拉德  这是理查德・卡塞尔  我的同事
Brad, this is Richard Castle. We work together.

794
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:51,879
阿曼达  这是凯特・贝克特  我的同事
Uh, Amanda, this is Kate Beckett. We work together.

795
00:29:51,879 --> 00:29:53,445
认识你很高兴
Hi. Nice to meet you.

796
00:29:53,445 --> 00:29:55,612
你在这里做什么
Ah. What are you doing here?

797
00:29:55,612 --> 00:29:58,645
-你知道我要来  -我知道你想来
-You knew that I was coming here. -I knew you wanted to come here.

798
00:29:58,645 --> 00:30:00,490
我以为这么晚你订不到位子
I didn't think you could get a table last-minute.

799
00:30:00,491 --> 00:30:01,545
你这么晚还是订到了位子
You got a table last-minute.

800
00:30:01,545 --> 00:30:05,145
-是的  我找的人  -我也是  市卫生检察员
- Yeah. I've got connections. - So do I. City health inspector.

801
00:30:05,145 --> 00:30:07,645
充分滥用了职权
Wow. Nice abuse of power.

802
00:30:08,149 --> 00:30:09,527
理查德  你也是警察
So, Richard, you a cop, too?

803
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:11,839
不  他是小说家  查案时的
No. He's a novelist who's been shadowing me

804
00:30:12,093 --> 00:30:14,853
-跟班  -我比跟班做的多一点
- on my murder cases. - Oh, I do a little more than shadowing.

805
00:30:15,486 --> 00:30:16,184
二位可以入座了
Your table is ready.

806
00:30:21,042 --> 00:30:22,639
你们一起调查凶杀案
So you two working a homicide?

807
00:30:23,077 --> 00:30:24,092
有两名死者的凶杀案
Um, a double homicide.

808
00:30:24,409 --> 00:30:27,698
实际上非常棘手  因为凶手是...
It's actually a rather tricky case because the killer is...

809
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,352
我喜欢称他神秘第三人
I like to call him the third man.

810
00:30:29,357 --> 00:30:32,307
真神秘啊  听着像你的小说
Very mysterious. It sounds like one of your books.

811
00:30:32,389 --> 00:30:33,419
是的  有点类似
Yeah, it kinda does.

812
00:30:33,928 --> 00:30:37,182
-不管怎样  他和两个同伙...  -要抢劫银行
- Anyway, he and his two partners... - were gonna rob a bank,

813
00:30:37,815 --> 00:30:39,001
但任务还没完成
only he turned on the other two 

814
00:30:39,065 --> 00:30:41,642
他就杀死了自己的两个同伙
and killed them before they even finished the job.

815
00:30:41,731 --> 00:30:42,885
是不是根本不合理
I mean, it doesn't even make any sense.

816
00:30:43,227 --> 00:30:44,957
罪犯通常拿到了钱
Usually you'd wait until you got the money

817
00:30:45,082 --> 00:30:46,250
才出卖同伙
before you double-crossed your partners.

818
00:30:46,642 --> 00:30:48,665
抢劫银行  他们连装备都没备齐
I mean, they didn't even have the right equipment to rob a bank.

819
00:30:48,971 --> 00:30:50,618
我相信  你最后会查明真相的
Well, I'm sure you'll figure it out eventually.

820
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,394
说到奇闻秘事
You know, speaking of great mysteries,

821
00:30:52,404 --> 00:30:53,527
那晚  我在百老汇看了一出
I saw an incredible play off broadway 

822
00:30:53,535 --> 00:30:55,711
-不错的剧目  -我真希望能查明
- the other night. - I just wish I could figure out

823
00:30:55,749 --> 00:30:57,777
他们用氯氨酮干什么
what they were doing with the ketamine.

824
00:30:57,867 --> 00:30:59,641
或许跟宠物店有关
Maybe it had something to do with the pet store.

825
00:31:01,704 --> 00:31:02,179
你要吃那个吗
You gonna eat that?

826
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,669
那里不像是有什么能偷的啊
It's not like there was really anything to steal there.

827
00:31:05,084 --> 00:31:07,334
除非宠物店是其他东西的幌子
Unless the pet store was just a front for something else.

828
00:31:11,025 --> 00:31:12,900
服务员  请再给我一杯酒
Waiter. Could I have another glass of wine, please?

829
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,901
这种情况下  店主说没什么可偷的
In which case, the owner might have been lying

830
00:31:14,992 --> 00:31:15,728
可能是在撒谎
when he said that nothing was stolen.

831
00:31:17,551 --> 00:31:19,076
过一会想跟我上床吗
You want to have sex with me later?

832
00:31:19,453 --> 00:31:21,020
抱歉  介意我打个电话吗
I'm sorry. Would you mind if I made a telephone call?

833
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,020
当然不会
Nah.

834
00:31:23,516 --> 00:31:23,963
谢谢
Thanks.

835
00:31:27,124 --> 00:31:29,596
洗手间就在前台旁边  对吧
Um... the bathrooms are up by the front, right?

836
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:31,528
请原谅
Pardon me.

837
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:36,226
有什么消息吗
Have you got something?

838
00:31:36,307 --> 00:31:39,154
我让莱恩和埃斯波西托帮我查点东西
I was just having Ryan and Esposito run something down for me.

839
00:31:39,463 --> 00:31:39,871
宠物店
The pet shop.

840
00:31:40,097 --> 00:31:43,133
-是的  你怎么知道  -心有灵犀
- Yes! How did you know? - I was thinking the exact same thing.

841
00:31:43,228 --> 00:31:44,638
很可能是什么东西的幌子
It's probably a front for something.

842
00:31:44,675 --> 00:31:46,539
关于店主  他们会彻查的
Okay, so they're gonna dig up everything they can on the owner.

843
00:31:46,653 --> 00:31:47,989
-也许他有所隐瞒  -没错
- It could be that he's hiding something. - Right.

844
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,293
-我该回去了  -约会如何
- Well, I should get back to this date. - How's yours going?

845
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,413
-好极了  你呢  -棒极了
- Great. Yours? - Fantastic.

846
00:31:53,868 --> 00:31:56,110
回头见
Well, I'll, uh, see you.

847
00:31:57,993 --> 00:31:58,773
野鸡肉鲜美可口
The pheasant is amazing.

848
00:32:05,736 --> 00:32:06,532
抱歉  是局里打来的
I'm sorry. That's the station.

849
00:32:07,156 --> 00:32:08,294
是的  接吧
Yeah. Go ahead.

850
00:32:10,938 --> 00:32:11,397
请原谅
Would you pardon me?

851
00:32:12,628 --> 00:32:13,097
又去洗手间
Bathroom again?

852
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:23,779
查到了什么吗
So what'd they find out?

853
00:32:24,327 --> 00:32:24,751
是的
Yo.

854
00:32:24,911 --> 00:32:26,993
查了宠物店店主  诺埃尔・杜・普利 
We ran the pet shop owner-- Noel Du Preez.

855
00:32:27,493 --> 00:32:28,653
-身家清白  -真的
- He came up clean. - Really?

856
00:32:29,508 --> 00:32:30,635
在过去的几天里呢
What about in the past couple of days?

857
00:32:30,693 --> 00:32:31,641
有何异常吗
Anything unusual? 

858
00:32:31,642 --> 00:32:34,426
前天  海关方面查到他那有
The day before yesterday, customs has him taking possession

859
00:32:34,948 --> 00:32:39,135
六只非洲灰鹦鹉  四只狒狒蜘蛛
of a half a dozen African gray parrots, four baboon spiders

860
00:32:39,689 --> 00:32:42,475
两条黑尾纹巨蟒  都来自南非
and two black-tailed pythons, all from south Africa.

861
00:32:42,997 --> 00:32:43,983
等等
Wait a minute. Did you--

862
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,610
你说南非的黑尾蟒
did you say black-tailed pythons from South Africa?

863
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,265
是  怎么了
Yeah. Why? 

864
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:49,061
因为黑尾蟒
Because black-tailed pythons,

865
00:32:49,423 --> 00:32:50,685
也叫印度岩蟒
also known as Indian rock pythons,

866
00:32:51,018 --> 00:32:52,207
并非生于非洲
are not indigenous to that area.

867
00:32:52,511 --> 00:32:53,398
为什么会从那里运过来呢
Why would they be coming from Africa?

868
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:55,600
管那吓人飞机上
Why do you care about some motherfreaking snakes 

869
00:32:55,601 --> 00:32:56,609
吓死人的蛇干嘛
on a motherfreaking plane?

870
00:32:56,632 --> 00:32:58,280
作为一个侦探小说家
Because as a murder mystery novelist,

871
00:32:58,614 --> 00:33:00,392
我必须了解罪犯的想法
I am highly paid to think like a bad guy.

872
00:33:00,673 --> 00:33:02,407
蛇有几个有意思的特点
Here are a few fun facts about snakes.

873
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:05,344
它们是冷血动物  能吞下巨物
They are cold-blooded, they swallow huge amounts,

874
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,181
并且消化得很慢
and they digest their food very slowly.

875
00:33:08,388 --> 00:33:09,412
正适合走私
Perfect for smuggling. 

876
00:33:09,413 --> 00:33:10,436
这肯定不是初犯了
And it wouldn't be the first time.

877
00:33:10,713 --> 00:33:12,126
如果这些蟒蛇来自南非
If these snakes are coming in from South Africa...

878
00:33:12,999 --> 00:33:15,244
南非盛产两样东西
There are two things in abundance in South Africa--

879
00:33:15,932 --> 00:33:17,475
种族仇恨和钻石
racial hatred and diamonds.

880
00:33:18,235 --> 00:33:20,458
在活蛇体内走私钻石
Smuggling diamonds in live snakes.

881
00:33:20,459 --> 00:33:22,795
袭击米齐的人说事关几百万
Mickey's attacker said that there were millions at stake.

882
00:33:23,135 --> 00:33:24,928
而且升降机直通宠物店
and the dumbwaiter goes right down into the pet store.

883
00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:26,805
所以梅特兰一家必须本周出行
That's why the Maitlands' trip had to be this week.

884
00:33:27,063 --> 00:33:27,843
他们知道货就要到了
They knew the shipment was coming in.

885
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:30,366
-氯胺酮  -用来麻醉蟒蛇
- And the ketamine-- - was to dope the snakes.

886
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,806
他们就可以不费吹灰之力取货
So they could take 'em up the shaft without a fight,

887
00:33:31,807 --> 00:33:32,791
我们去宠物店时
and then when we came to the store-- 

888
00:33:32,794 --> 00:33:33,943
店主三缄其口
The owner couldn't say a word,

889
00:33:34,033 --> 00:33:35,452
他怕收到走私案的牵连
otherwise he'd implicate himself in smuggling.

890
00:33:35,702 --> 00:33:36,430
一旦我们找到劫犯
So we find out who robbed him-- 

891
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,758
我们就找到了第三个人
We find the third man.

892
00:33:38,211 --> 00:33:39,751
他们知道彼此说话珠联璧合吗
Do they know they're finishing each other's sentences?

893
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,688
让同事逮捕店主  在店里集合
Have uniforms pick up the owner. We'll meet you at the store.

894
00:33:44,705 --> 00:33:46,473
这里有人吗
Hey, is this seat taken?

895
00:33:46,737 --> 00:33:48,265
我们要跟他们说什么呢
What should we tell them?

896
00:33:48,543 --> 00:33:49,503
太尴尬了
This is gonna be awkward.

897
00:33:52,272 --> 00:33:53,743
他们会相处愉快的
They'll be okay.

898
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:06,078
缉拿到店主了吗
Is the owner in custody?

899
00:34:06,456 --> 00:34:07,258
他妻子说他还在这里加班
Wife said he was here working late.

900
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:08,738
看起来已经打烊了
Place looks closed. 

901
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:10,218
卡塞尔  帮我拿包
Okay, Castle, hold my purse.

902
00:34:11,273 --> 00:34:12,035
跟上
Follow me.

903
00:34:22,362 --> 00:34:23,341
准备好了吗  走
Ready? Let's go.

904
00:34:30,789 --> 00:34:31,614
房间里没人
Room all clear.

905
00:34:32,294 --> 00:34:32,969
这里也是
Here, too.

906
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:38,280
纽约警察  放下武器
NYPD! Drop your weapon! Drop your weapon!

907
00:34:39,023 --> 00:34:40,724
把枪放下
Drop the gun! Drop your weapon! Drop the gun!

908
00:34:41,056 --> 00:34:41,878
把枪放下  趴下
Drop the gun! Get down! Down!

909
00:34:45,533 --> 00:34:46,533
你没事吧
Hey. You okay?

910
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:49,280
这点小事吓不倒我
It takes a lot more than that to scare me.

911
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,932
如果你肩膀上有一只毛茸茸的大蜘蛛呢
What about a big, hairy spider on your shoulder? 

912
00:34:52,374 --> 00:34:53,512
那会吓我一跳
Yeah, that would do it.

913
00:35:00,427 --> 00:35:02,993
我怎么知道你们是警察
How did I know you were the police?

914
00:35:02,993 --> 00:35:05,427
我有权保护自己的店
I have a right to defend my store.

915
00:35:05,427 --> 00:35:07,361
你要提防谁  杜・普利先生
Defend from who, Mr. Du Preez?

916
00:35:08,028 --> 00:35:08,908
根据海关的记录
According to customs,

917
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:12,467
你有两条黑尾蟒
you took possession of two black-tailed pythons.

918
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:13,944
这又没犯罪
Which is not a crime.

919
00:35:14,706 --> 00:35:17,261
但黑尾蟒原产于印度
No, but black-tailed pythons are indigenous to India.

920
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:18,820
为什么要从南非运来呢
So why ship them in from South Africa?

921
00:35:19,809 --> 00:35:20,578
我的供应商在那里
My suppliers are there.

922
00:35:21,751 --> 00:35:22,844
我的生意合理合法
There's nothing illegal about my business.

923
00:35:23,741 --> 00:35:24,524
那些蛇在哪儿呢
Then where are the snakes?

924
00:35:25,226 --> 00:35:25,901
没在店里
They weren't in the store,

925
00:35:26,405 --> 00:35:28,704
而且没有发票能证明已售
and we didn't find any invoices indicating that they were sold.

926
00:35:28,788 --> 00:35:29,658
你知道我们找到什么了吗
You know what we did find?

927
00:35:30,334 --> 00:35:33,476
一个比色计  一盏紫外灯和克拉秤
A color grader, a U.V. lamp and a carat weight scale. 

928
00:35:33,476 --> 00:35:34,682
都是买卖钻石所需的工具
All tools of the diamond trade.

929
00:35:34,697 --> 00:35:36,306
怎么回事  杜・普利先生
So what happened, Mr. Du Preez?

930
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:38,999
我们认为有人从升降机通道
Because we think someone broke into your store,

931
00:35:39,466 --> 00:35:40,535
闯入你的店里
came down the dumbwaiter shaft

932
00:35:41,163 --> 00:35:42,737
偷走了你的钻石
and stole your shipment of diamonds.

933
00:35:43,762 --> 00:35:44,582
那是你的问题
Now that's your problem.

934
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:47,291
我的问题是那两具尸体
My problem is that they left two bodies behind.

935
00:35:51,688 --> 00:35:54,242
你不想受牵连  我明白
Okay, fine. You don't want to implicate yourself. I get it.

936
00:35:54,731 --> 00:35:57,349
那我提问  运货的事都有谁知道
So I'm simply gonna ask, who knew about the shipment?

937
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,405
拜托  杜・普利先生
Come on, Mr. Du Preez. 

938
00:36:01,406 --> 00:36:02,749
你不想知道他们是谁吗
Don't you want us to find them?

939
00:36:03,017 --> 00:36:04,883
谁知道  你告诉过谁
Who knew? Who did you tell? 

940
00:36:04,883 --> 00:36:05,402
我谁都没告诉
I told no one.

941
00:36:05,452 --> 00:36:06,906
杜・普利先生
Mr. Du Preez-- 

942
00:36:06,907 --> 00:36:08,360
我自己去机场取的货
I picked up my cargo at the airport personally,

943
00:36:09,535 --> 00:36:10,554
把它们锁在办公室里
and I locked 'em in my office.

944
00:36:13,503 --> 00:36:14,448
第二天  就不见了
The next day, they were gone.

945
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:19,974
你认识这些人吗
Do you recognize either of these men?

946
00:36:21,382 --> 00:36:24,138
没有  这些人我从来都没见过
No. I've never seen any of them in my life.

947
00:36:25,303 --> 00:36:26,070
我说的是实话
It's the truth.

948
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,312
抢劫走私贩  真是完美的犯罪
Robbing a smuggler. It's almost a perfect crime.

949
00:36:29,967 --> 00:36:31,344
受害者不能报警
The victim can't go to the police

950
00:36:31,672 --> 00:36:33,166
除非认罪
without admitting his own crime.

951
00:36:33,303 --> 00:36:35,021
有人知道货物放在哪里
Someone knew that shipment was coming in.

952
00:36:35,405 --> 00:36:36,709
而且蓄谋已久
Someone had it planned.

953
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:39,482
道格的客户名单调查得如何
Where are we on Doug's client list?

954
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,182
查了道格的所有客户
We ran every client Doug ever had, 

955
00:36:41,183 --> 00:36:41,924
一无所获
and we got Nada.

956
00:36:42,271 --> 00:36:43,293
为求万全
Just to be thorough, 

957
00:36:43,293 --> 00:36:44,679
还给米齐看了车管局那边的照片
we showed their D.M.V. Photos to Mickey.

958
00:36:45,007 --> 00:36:46,542
他们都不是神秘的第三人
None of them were our mysterious third man.

959
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:49,068
一定是杜・普利想不到的人
Well, it had to be someone Du Preez would never expect.

960
00:36:49,477 --> 00:36:51,941
与宠物店有关的人
Someone connected to his pet store in some capacity,

961
00:36:51,941 --> 00:36:52,597
可能是前雇员吗
an old employee perhaps?

962
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:54,470
他得知道货物何时运达
He would have to know when the shipment was coming in.

963
00:36:55,228 --> 00:36:57,028
知道他时间表的人
Yeah, someone who knew his timetable.

964
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,984
也许是杜・普利之前派去机场
Maybe somebone Du Preez had sent to the airport previously

965
00:37:01,336 --> 00:37:02,303
取货的人
to pick up a shipment.

966
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:03,271
去机场
Out to the airport.

967
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:04,235
干什么
What was that?

968
00:37:04,236 --> 00:37:06,417
查查上次杜・普利取货的记录
Run all of the paperwork from Du Preez's last shipment--

969
00:37:06,418 --> 00:37:09,732
海关方面  检疫方面  物流公司等等
customs, fish and wildlife, shipping company, everything.

970
00:37:09,732 --> 00:37:11,009
查什么人知道货物及取货时间
I want to know who knew what and when.

971
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:13,900
你是说有人在机场看到杜・普利走私
You think someone at the airport caught on to Du Preez's smuggling,

972
00:37:14,061 --> 00:37:15,604
决定抢劫而非报警
decided to rob him instead of report him?

973
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:17,621
不仅如此  我想我知道是谁了
Not only that. I think I know who.

974
00:37:18,874 --> 00:37:21,569
科佩克夫妇  谢谢你们这么晚还能来
Mr. And Mrs. Kopek, thank you for coming in so late.

975
00:37:21,569 --> 00:37:22,792
请坐
Please.

976
00:37:23,133 --> 00:37:24,307
对不起  这么久才到
Oh, sorry, it took so long.

977
00:37:24,622 --> 00:37:25,759
你打电话的时候  斯坦正在工作
Stan was at work when you called.

978
00:37:25,862 --> 00:37:26,468
没事
Oh, right.

979
00:37:27,526 --> 00:37:29,758
你说过最后见到你弟弟是在
You said that the last time that you saw your brother

980
00:37:30,111 --> 00:37:33,315
旅行社在斯坦公司举行的派对上  是吗
was at the agency's party around where Stan works? 

981
00:37:33,316 --> 00:37:34,410
没错
That's right.

982
00:37:34,466 --> 00:37:36,040
科佩克先生  你能重新告诉我
Could you refresh my memory, Mr. Kopek?

983
00:37:36,325 --> 00:37:37,743
你在哪里工作吗
Where is it that you work? 

984
00:37:37,744 --> 00:37:38,289
夜深了
It--it's late.

985
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:40,409
能直接告诉我们调查结果吗
Could--could you just please tell us what you found out?

986
00:37:41,069 --> 00:37:43,377
直到我想起来
Well, I didn't really put everything together

987
00:37:43,741 --> 00:37:45,693
你妻子说过在机场的派对
until I remembered your wife's story

988
00:37:45,693 --> 00:37:48,382
我才把一切都联系起来
about the party at the airport.

989
00:37:50,206 --> 00:37:50,876
这是什么
What's this?

990
00:37:51,942 --> 00:37:53,223
这是一份海关申报表  科佩克先生
It's a customs form, Mr. Kopek,

991
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,573
允许诺埃尔・杜・普利先生
Authorizing the release of cargo

992
00:37:55,949 --> 00:37:57,509
取货
to a Mr. Noel Du Preez,

993
00:37:57,526 --> 00:37:58,880
你签的字
Signed by you.

994
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,303
那又怎样  我在海关工作
Yeah. So? I-I work for customs.

995
00:38:02,529 --> 00:38:03,369
那又怎样
What's-- what's the big deal?

996
00:38:04,177 --> 00:38:04,943
怎么了  斯坦
What's going on, Stan?

997
00:38:05,274 --> 00:38:06,375
我不知道
I have no idea.

998
00:38:06,376 --> 00:38:07,177
别装傻了
Sure you do.

999
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,800
当你知道杜・普利
When you realized what Mr. Du Preez was doing--

1000
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:11,646
走私钻石  你对自己说
smuggling diamonds-- you said to yourself,

1001
00:38:11,647 --> 00:38:14,275
"何必放过那些忘恩负义的混蛋
"Why should I give him up to those ungrateful bastards?

1002
00:38:14,435 --> 00:38:15,863
为什么不给自己谋些好处呢"
"Why not just take care of myself?"

1003
00:38:16,383 --> 00:38:18,025
你需要做的只是
Then all you needed to do

1004
00:38:18,242 --> 00:38:19,988
从动物保护中心偷看进口许可
was pull the import permits from fish and wildlife

1005
00:38:20,462 --> 00:38:21,714
来决定动手的时间
to determine when the next shipment would be.

1006
00:38:22,797 --> 00:38:26,005
但你还需要找到
But you needed someone with connections

1007
00:38:26,005 --> 00:38:26,760
能入室盗窃的人
to fencing stolen goods.

1008
00:38:27,234 --> 00:38:28,697
所以你联系了安东・弗朗西斯
And so you contacted Anton Francis--

1009
00:38:29,023 --> 00:38:31,128
骗子  高中老同学
a con man and an old high school buddy

1010
00:38:31,429 --> 00:38:33,574
进出监狱多年的家伙
who'd been in and out of jail for years.

1011
00:38:34,004 --> 00:38:35,977
用钱就可以买通他
The easy score was money to his ears,

1012
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:37,992
但你需要梅特兰一家
but you needed to get the Maitlands out of town

1013
00:38:38,243 --> 00:38:39,027
先离开几天
for a couple of days first.

1014
00:38:39,577 --> 00:38:41,363
此时你就拉小舅子道格入伙了
And that's when your brother-in-law Doug came in.

1015
00:38:41,508 --> 00:38:42,465
你做了什么  斯坦
What did you do, Stan?

1016
00:38:43,091 --> 00:38:45,244
你是不是利用了他的梦想
Did you play on his dreams, 

1017
00:38:45,245 --> 00:38:48,297
跟他说  他能实现开潜水用品店的梦想了
tell him he could finally afford that scuba shop he always wanted? 

1018
00:38:48,298 --> 00:38:50,349
斯坦  你做了什么
Stan, what did you do?

1019
00:38:50,409 --> 00:38:51,547
我什么都没做  我不知道
Nothing. Nothing. I-I don't know--

1020
00:38:51,548 --> 00:38:53,825
科佩克太太  你丈夫杀死了你弟弟
Mrs. Kopek, your husband killed your brother.

1021
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,151
-太荒...  -斯坦...
- That's ri-- - Stan...

1022
00:38:55,675 --> 00:38:57,368
他们撒谎  这太荒谬了
They're lying. That's-- that's ridiculous.

1023
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,525
我们有证人  科佩克先生
We have a witness, Mr. Kopek.

1024
00:39:00,409 --> 00:39:01,322
几十分钟前  你想要杀死的
The squatter you tried to kill

1025
00:39:01,565 --> 00:39:02,748
违法借住客
identified you from a photo array

1026
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:05,039
在照片中指认了你
less than an hour ago. 

1027
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,631
天啊
Oh, god.

1028
00:39:06,546 --> 00:39:08,748
不  我也不想这样的
No, no, it was--it wasn't supposed to happen like this.

1029
00:39:09,374 --> 00:39:10,292
我没想伤他
N-no one was supposed to get hurt.

1030
00:39:10,665 --> 00:39:13,428
道格  他不听我说的
I mean, Doug--he just-- he wouldn't listen.

1031
00:39:13,738 --> 00:39:14,871
我不是说...
And I-I didn't mean...

1032
00:39:15,173 --> 00:39:17,384
安东  他在我后面
And--and Anton, he came after me.

1033
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,635
他...  那是自卫  我不是凶手
He--that was self-defense. I'm not--I'm not a killer.

1034
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:22,670
我们有两具尸体证明你是凶手
We have two bodies that prove otherwise.

1035
00:39:23,533 --> 00:39:27,078
事情发展不受控制了
It just got out of hand. Things just spun out of control.

1036
00:39:27,195 --> 00:39:28,621
-把他带走吧  -宝贝
- Get him away from me. - Honey, it's--

1037
00:39:32,076 --> 00:39:32,953
站起来
On your feet.

1038
00:39:36,106 --> 00:39:36,901
我为了我们才这么做的
I did it for us.

1039
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:40,383
都是为了我们  宝贝
It was all for us, baby.

1040
00:39:44,508 --> 00:39:46,579
你们认为是我瞎编的
And you guys thought I made the whole thing up.

1041
00:39:46,957 --> 00:39:48,075
我可一直都相信你
I believed you the whole time.

1042
00:39:50,391 --> 00:39:51,763
我现在会怎样
So what--what happens to me now?

1043
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,956
回拘留室
I'll go back to the holding cell

1044
00:39:53,177 --> 00:39:54,250
还是要入土了
or am I headed to the tombs? 

1045
00:39:54,251 --> 00:39:56,980
都不是  你配合我们逮捕斯坦・科佩克
Neither. For your cooperation in the apprehension

1046
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,635
检察官助理同意宽大处理
of Stan Kopek, the A.D.A. has agreed to a deal.

1047
00:39:59,503 --> 00:40:01,176
五年缓刑
Five years probation for all your sins.

1048
00:40:01,177 --> 00:40:01,970
不用坐牢
No jail time?

1049
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,355
你有了重新做人的机会  米齐
You have a shot at a second chance, Mickey.

1050
00:40:03,556 --> 00:40:04,591
别搞砸了
Don't blow it.

1051
00:40:05,635 --> 00:40:08,385
不会的  谢谢
I won't. Hey, thanks for everything.

1052
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:10,865
真的  谢谢
Really, thank you. 

1053
00:40:16,745 --> 00:40:17,838
我等不及回家
Oh, man. I can't wait to go home

1054
00:40:18,158 --> 00:40:19,787
-洗个热水澡了  -我
- and just slip into a warm bath and-- - I--

1055
00:40:19,788 --> 00:40:22,162
别  别说
Don't. Please don't.

1056
00:40:22,744 --> 00:40:25,905
我只是想说  我饿死了
I was just going to say, I'm starving.

1057
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:27,890
我还没吃完主菜  就离开餐厅了
We left the restaurant before I had a chance to finish my entree.

1058
00:40:28,049 --> 00:40:30,033
你吃完了也没用
Oh, yeah. Well, it wouldn't have mattered if you did.

1059
00:40:30,183 --> 00:40:31,838
那里菜量很小
The portions there were tiny.

1060
00:40:33,251 --> 00:40:34,866
你知道雷米餐厅二十四小时营业
You know, Remy's is open all night.

1061
00:40:35,105 --> 00:40:36,095
他们有汉堡
They've got those burgers...

1062
00:40:36,857 --> 00:40:37,787
还有奶昔
Oh, and those shakes...

1063
00:40:44,031 --> 00:40:44,802
为什么不去呢
Oh, why not?

1064
00:40:48,506 --> 00:40:49,321
你的约会怎么样
So how did your date go?

1065
00:40:51,184 --> 00:40:51,977
她很无聊
She was kind of boring.

1066
00:40:52,501 --> 00:40:53,462
没说几句话
Didn't talk much. 

1067
00:40:54,525 --> 00:40:55,148
七月先生呢
Mr. July?

1068
00:40:56,592 --> 00:40:58,127
-有点自负  -看出来了
- A little self-absorbed. - Looked it.

1069
00:40:58,352 --> 00:40:59,560
-真的吗  -能看得出
- Really? - You can tell.

1070
00:41:00,781 --> 00:41:02,345
约会时  有些人就是没法表现得体
Some people just don't know how to behave on a date.

1071
00:41:02,652 --> 00:41:05,221
-尤其是第一次约会  -说得好
- Especially on a first date. - Exactly.
