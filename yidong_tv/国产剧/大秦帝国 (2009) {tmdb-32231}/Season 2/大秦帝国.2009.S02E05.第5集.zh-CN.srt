把角落那帮废材弄出来

钱都放桌子上

00:03:10,051 --> 00:03:10,810
这就对了
That's right.

10
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:13,644
弟兄们 好好审问他们
Give 'em the third degree,boys.

11
00:03:14,198 --> 00:03:15,438
该死

19
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,048
什么风把你吹来纽约了
So,what brings you to New York?

20
00:04:01,128 --> 00:04:02,655
我也想问你这个问题
I was about to ask you the same thing.

21
00:04:02,805 --> 00:04:05,227
我家在这 在这退休也是理所当然

约翰 你气色不错 很放松

还是不太能吞咽

24
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:14,818
一小块饼干就有可能让我一命呜呼
A few crumbs from a biscotto'll send me into a choking fit.

25
00:04:15,225 --> 00:04:16,474
总得付出点代价的
Small price to pay.

26
00:04:16,846 --> 00:04:18,787
问题是不知道为何而付出这代价呀
If only I knew what I was paying for.

27
00:04:19,353 --> 00:04:20,950
我一直觉得是为班宁吧
I'd always assumed O'Banion.

28
00:04:22,373 --> 00:04:23,755
离家稍近点

Let's just say whoever it was, I got the message.

31
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:32,536
参与这事的几个人
Most fellas in this business,

32
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:36,520
都直接去阎王爷那报道了

老大乔 整个墓地里最有钱的人

41
00:04:55,816 --> 00:04:58,516
吃得饱 看看电影 喂喂鸟
I eat,go to pictures, feed the birds.

42
00:04:58,719 --> 00:05:02,016
我终于脱离那烂摊子了 绝不回头了
I walked away from that other shit and I never looked back.

43
00:05:02,264 --> 00:05:05,698
那估计你也不知道是谁要买我的命吧
Then I suppose you'd have no opinion on who tried to have me clipped.

44
00:05:06,378 --> 00:05:09,187
什么 什么时候的事
What? When was this?

就在哈瓦那(古巴城市) 两天前
Havana. Two days ago.

46
00:05:12,182 --> 00:05:13,779
天啊
Jesus Christ.

47
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,432
事发之前 我还在咖啡店遇见了梅耶 兰斯基
I ran into Meyer Lansky at a cafe before it happened.

48
00:05:17,601 --> 00:05:18,886
他经常去那边
He's down there all the time.

49
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:20,816
-为何  -谁知道呢
-What for? - Who knows?

50
00:05:20,842 --> 00:05:22,115
逃避他老婆吧
Get away from his wife.

51
00:05:23,251 --> 00:05:25,160
先是马塞里亚 现在是我
Masseria,then me.

52
00:05:25,643 --> 00:05:27,446
相隔不到24小时
Within 24 hours.

53
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:31,585
要我说 我认为那犹太人是马拉暂罗派来的
Ask me,the little kike's taking orders from Maranzano.

54
00:05:32,653 --> 00:05:35,679
那就找他问清楚 面对面好好谈谈
Sit down with him direct. Look him right in the eye.

55
00:05:35,923 --> 00:05:38,368
-马拉暂罗吗  -我可以帮你搭线 如果你想的话
-Maranzano? - I'll broker if you want.

56
00:05:38,908 --> 00:05:40,125
帮你约他
Be your go-between.

57
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:45,626
这年复一年的
Year in,year out,

58
00:05:46,774 --> 00:05:49,201
物是人非了 却始终围着一个问题打转
different dogs, same fucking bone.

59
00:05:49,398 --> 00:05:51,452
你还要我说几次啊
Well,how many times you need to hear it?

60
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:55,182
由天命 退休颐养天年吧
Take the hint and retire already.

61
00:06:11,785 --> 00:06:13,527
耶和华啊 请守护你的孩子们
O Lord,who watches over children

62
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:16,228
不管是此生 抑或是来世
in this present life and the world to come,

63
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,695
让他们在安息中
bringing them to live with the spirits

64
00:06:20,739 --> 00:06:22,296
得到永生
of the divine rest,

65
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,687
请接收你的小仆人苏珊
receive in peace the soul

66
00:06:26,674 --> 00:06:29,742
让她的灵魂收获安宁
of your little servant Susan.

67
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,780
-阿门  -阿门
-Amen. -Amen.

68
00:06:41,491 --> 00:06:42,677
该死的高烧
Damn heat.

69
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,442
他们为何还没来
Why haven't they come?

70
00:06:46,623 --> 00:06:49,554
我一小时前就通知殡仪馆的人了
I sent a message for the undertaker hours ago.

71
00:06:52,615 --> 00:06:54,706
快帮你们的姐妹祈祷吧
Say a prayer for your sister.

72
00:06:55,295 --> 00:06:57,050
快 祈祷吧
Go... go on.

73
00:06:57,144 --> 00:06:58,869
她死了
Is she dead?

74
00:07:00,468 --> 00:07:01,769
别哭
Hush yourself now.

75
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:05,721
亲爱的 她去见耶稣了
She's with Jesus now,dear.

76
00:07:06,022 --> 00:07:08,020
没事的
It's going to be all right.

77
00:07:12,512 --> 00:07:13,824
带他出去
Take him outside.

78
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:19,679
出去 该死的 你也该干嘛干嘛去
Go,God damn it, and get to your work.

79
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:32,960
我们没钱了吗 所以他们才不来 是吗
Have we no money? Is that why they haven't come?

80
00:07:34,044 --> 00:07:36,039
罐子里还有一块钱
There was a dollar in the tin.

81
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,315
-让我来解决  -你是不是又拿去买酒了
-Leave me be. -Did you drink it away?

82
00:07:38,493 --> 00:07:42,234
-你说啊  -她也是我的孩子
-Just tell me that. -She's my child,too.

83
00:07:42,448 --> 00:07:45,151
想到她要葬在公共墓地我就难过
The thought of her in potter's field.

84
00:07:45,309 --> 00:07:46,665
不可能
There'll be none of that.

85
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,657
闭嘴
Quiet now.

86
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:50,737
把她埋在院子里吧
She'll rest in the yard

87
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:52,605
离家近
so she's close.

88
00:07:53,257 --> 00:07:56,890
纽约

89
00:08:05,172 --> 00:08:06,998
抱歉 很紧张
Sorry. Nerves.

90
00:08:07,576 --> 00:08:10,540
事实自证
Res ipsa loquitur.

91
00:08:12,904 --> 00:08:13,967
汤普森先生
Mr. Thompson?

92
00:08:14,574 --> 00:08:16,491

威廉 汤普森
William Thompson.

95
00:08:37,963 --> 00:08:39,455
罗伯特 霍奇 欢迎
Robert Hodge. Welcome.

96
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,470
-外面很多人吗  -有点
-Is it crowded out there? -A little bit.

97
00:08:44,903 --> 00:08:46,064
假设
Hypothetical...

98
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,367
你是助理检控官
you're an assistant US Attorney,

99
00:08:47,521 --> 00:08:49,320
你要起诉一个人 假设他叫贝克吧
you're prosecuting a fella, let's call him Baker.

100
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:51,103
他因为偷窃被捕
Now,this Baker's been arrested for petty theft,

101
00:08:51,221 --> 00:08:52,531
由于第二天一早 就要放人了
due to be released the next morning.

102
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:54,327
当晚 一个警探来电
That night,a detective calls,

103
00:08:54,438 --> 00:08:57,141
说这个人就是俄亥俄州
says he's certain this is the same Baker who's a stickup artist

104
00:08:57,253 --> 00:08:59,489
一系列抢劫案的劫匪
from Ohio wanted for a string of robberies.

105
00:08:59,585 --> 00:09:02,157
他要你"不小心"遗失犯人的释放文件
What he needs is for you to misplace Baker's paperwork

106
00:09:02,274 --> 00:09:04,649
好扣押他直到扬斯敦的逮捕文件到达 
till the file arrives from Youngstown in two more days.

107
00:09:04,781 --> 00:09:08,324
如果你不这样做 犯人就会被释放 他就有可能潜逃了
If you don't and Baker's released, chances are he'll flee.

108
00:09:09,714 --> 00:09:10,705
你会做吗
Well?

109
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:12,818
我不会做
I can't do it.

110
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,230
他只不过被扣押多一会
So he cools his heels awhile.

111
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:16,500
在牢房里多呆两天而已
Three squares and a cot.

112
00:09:16,675 --> 00:09:18,805
对谁都不是坏事
That's not a bad deal for anyone nowadays.

113
00:09:19,537 --> 00:09:22,071
-这是违反职业道德的  -他可是个累犯
-It's unethical,sir. -He's an ex-jailbird.

114
00:09:22,253 --> 00:09:23,404
他还杀了一个铁路工人
He killed a railway clerk.

115
00:09:23,518 --> 00:09:25,490
他抛弃了他的妻子和六个孩子
He left a wife and six kids

116
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:28,416
而你只需帮警察一点小忙而已 这都不行吗
and you can't do the police a simple favor?

117
00:09:30,174 --> 00:09:31,962
法律是盾牌 不是利剑
The law is a shield, sir,not a sword.

118
00:09:37,934 --> 00:09:40,501
大西洋城 圣灵高中
Holy Spirit High School, Atlantic City.

119
00:09:40,905 --> 00:09:43,584
在费城实习 纽约的圣约翰律师事务所任过职
Then Temple in Philadelphia and St. John's Law in New York.

120
00:09:43,622 --> 00:09:44,939
大西洋城
Atlantic City.

121
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:48,661
你该不会跟纳吉 汤普森是一家的吧
I don't suppose you're related to Nucky Thompson.

122
00:09:50,826 --> 00:09:52,250
他是我父亲的兄弟
He's my father's brother.

123
00:09:52,305 --> 00:09:55,686
这个关系通常被定义为叔侄关系
That relationship is usually classified as uncle.

124
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,332
先生 家人是无法选择的
Well,you don't get to choose your relatives,sir.

125
00:10:01,516 --> 00:10:02,234
确实
No.

126
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,661
但有些人 是可以选择他们的职员的
But some of us get to choose our staff members.

127
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:08,415
-霍奇先生 我...  -谢谢你来面试
-Mr. Hodge,I... -Thank you for coming in.

128
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,477
有必要的话 我会跟着他
I'd tail him myself if I had to.

129
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,571
-什么  -贝克 那个小偷
-What? -Baker,your stickup man.

130
00:10:21,599 --> 00:10:23,696
我会遵循法律条文 释放他
I'd make sure he was released in accordance with the law,

131
00:10:23,802 --> 00:10:25,163
但我不会让他离开我的视线范围
but I wouldn't let him out of my sight

132
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,055
直到扬斯敦的逮捕令下来
until the file arrived from Youngstown.

133
00:10:28,688 --> 00:10:29,953
先生 我很想成为一个检控官
I want to be a prosecutor,sir.

134
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:31,687
我想把罪犯都送进监狱
I want to put criminals in jail.

135
00:10:31,794 --> 00:10:33,379
不能一竹篙打死一船人
The ones who divide families.

136
00:10:33,907 --> 00:10:35,124
我看着我父亲死去
I've lost my own father,

137
00:10:35,316 --> 00:10:38,250
不知多少次 听着我母亲哭到睡去
heard my mother cry herself to sleep more times than I can count.

138
00:10:39,646 --> 00:10:41,895
我清楚知道犯罪活动给人带来的痛苦
I know the way crime eats you out from the inside.

139
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:43,890
我有切身体验 我对此非常痛恨

275
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,811
就会给我名分"...
he would do right by me and"...

276
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:37,380
你干嘛关掉
Why did you do that?

277
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:40,252
它会带来不好的氛围
It doesn't create a conducive atmosphere.

278
00:17:40,433 --> 00:17:41,620
我在听呢
I was listening.

279
00:17:41,732 --> 00:17:43,594
你可以在客厅里听
Well,you can listen in the parlor.

280
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:46,562
-没事的  -真的没事吧
-It's all right. -Isn't it all right?

281
00:17:46,676 --> 00:17:50,362
我还想听 真的很想听
I'd like to listen. I'd like to listen.

282
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,872
我想听纳丁 圣 克莱尔讲话
I'd like to listen to Nadine St. Clair.

283
00:17:52,997 --> 00:17:55,523
我...想听
I... I want to.

284
00:18:08,748 --> 00:18:10,016
总是这么吵吗
Always this noisy?

285
00:18:10,803 --> 00:18:13,667
-进步的声音  -一整栋复式楼层
-Sound of progress. -Got a whole complex planned.

286
00:18:13,787 --> 00:18:14,894
洛克菲勒中心
Rockefeller Center.

287
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:17,385
建一间神社对谁都没有影响
Nothing wrong with building a shrine to oneself.

288
00:18:17,502 --> 00:18:19,292
钱不就是这个用处吗
Isn't that what money's for?

289
00:18:32,692 --> 00:18:35,325
劳埃德议员表示遗憾
Your Senator Lloyd sends his regrets.

290
00:18:35,411 --> 00:18:37,322
他有事在华盛顿耽搁了
He's been detained down in Washington.

291
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:42,288
若大家不介意 我还是想占用一些时间
Well,if you don't mind,I'd like a few moments of your time anyway.

292
00:18:42,411 --> 00:18:44,595
你想干什么
And why exactly should you have it?

293
00:18:44,652 --> 00:18:45,788
作为新成立的五月花号
Because as the board members

294
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,778
粮食公司董事会成员
of the newly formed Mayflower Grain Corporation,

295
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:51,149
在我来看 局势相当明显
it's fairly obvious,to me at least,

296
00:18:51,595 --> 00:18:54,733
各位准备进军酒精行业
that you gentlemen are poised to enter the liquor business.

297
00:18:55,278 --> 00:18:56,228
有吗
Is that so?

298
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:57,745
除非是我多心了 各位觉得麦片要比
Unless I'm wrong and there's more potential

299
00:18:57,868 --> 00:19:00,680
大麦和啤酒花更有潜力
in Wheatena than in barley and hops.

300
00:19:01,482 --> 00:19:03,691
汤普森先生 为了拉拢议员
We agreed to meet,Mr. Thompson,

301
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:05,731
我们才同意会面
as an accommodation to the senator.

302
00:19:05,851 --> 00:19:07,329
由于你们的特殊关系
Owing to your special relationship.

303
00:19:07,436 --> 00:19:09,008
但为了便与讨论
But let's suppose for the moment,

304
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,613
可以假设你是对的
for the sake of argument,that you're right

305
00:19:11,725 --> 00:19:14,512
我们的确不是太关注早餐麦片
and breakfast cereal is only half our concern.

306
00:19:16,183 --> 00:19:18,256
但又为何要听你的呢
Why should we listen to you?

307
00:19:18,811 --> 00:19:21,553
因为我最近去了哈瓦那
As a result of my recent trip to Havana,

308
00:19:22,566 --> 00:19:24,602
还获得了巴卡第朗姆酒
I've secured exclusive North American

309
00:19:24,711 --> 00:19:27,991
北美独家发行权
distribution rights for Bacardi Rum.

310
00:19:28,941 --> 00:19:32,824
签署法律条文后 马上进行销售
In the event the sale of their product once again becomes legal.

311
00:19:32,976 --> 00:19:35,035
我提议合伙经营
I propose we pool our resources,

312
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:36,585
大家成为伙伴关系
enter into a partnership.

313
00:19:36,998 --> 00:19:38,588
以我的经验和技术
With my experience and know-how,

314
00:19:38,687 --> 00:19:39,753
我们可以建立一个基地
we can build an infrastructure

315
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:41,580
逐步扩大占有市场....
ready to distribute alcohol throughout...

316
00:19:41,697 --> 00:19:45,588
-什么经验  -你说什么
-What experience? -Beg pardon?

317
00:19:46,327 --> 00:19:48,285
你说的是什么经验
To what experience are you referring?

318
00:19:50,058 --> 00:19:52,181
我涉猎过许多领域
My background is quite varied.

319
00:19:52,301 --> 00:19:54,600
可以详细介绍一下吗
Would you care to elaborate?

320
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:58,523
你要是怀疑我的品行 劳埃德议员...
If there's any question of my integrity,Senator Lloyd...

321
00:19:58,657 --> 00:20:02,195
我们只想知道你进军酒水业的资格 请详述
We're simply asking what qualifies you to be in the liquor business.Specifically.

322
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,540
我的资格就是过去的11年间
What qualifies me is that for the past 11 years

323
00:20:06,649 --> 00:20:09,852
我是美国最成功的酒水走私商
I have been one of the most successful bootleggers in the country.

324
00:20:11,953 --> 00:20:14,563
我明白了
Oh,I see.

325
00:20:14,749 --> 00:20:17,864
你假装不知道 有什么很好的理由吗
Is there a reason you wanted to pretend as if you didn't know?

326
00:20:17,995 --> 00:20:20,118
我们更喜欢摆在台面上说话
We prefer putting our cards on the table.

327
00:20:20,232 --> 00:20:21,982
-这样才能达成共识  -好的
-Just so we're all on the same page. - Fine.

328
00:20:22,404 --> 00:20:24,810
那次危机对我的打击很大 先生们
The crash hit me hard as anyone,gentlemen.

329
00:20:25,482 --> 00:20:29,079
我没法提供资金来操作
I can't finance an operation like I have in mind on my own.

330
00:20:29,183 --> 00:20:31,722
这是本末倒置
You're putting the cart before the horse.

331
00:20:32,341 --> 00:20:34,435
你得向我们保证 汤普森先生
We need assurances,Mr. Thompson,

332
00:20:34,554 --> 00:20:37,760
禁酒令真的会撤销
that repeal actually is on the horizon.

333
00:20:37,872 --> 00:20:40,013
若那次集会表明了一件事
A half million women seem to think so,

334
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,890
那就是50万的女性都相信
if that rally was any indication.

335
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:45,282
女性改革 还是什么的
Women For Reform,or whatever they call themselves.

336
00:20:45,762 --> 00:20:48,923
想要实现和最终实现
Wanting something and achieving it

337
00:20:49,058 --> 00:20:50,712
是有天差地别的
are two very different things.

338
00:20:50,829 --> 00:20:53,082
但二者一般会接连发生
Though one naturally follows the other.

339
00:20:53,189 --> 00:20:54,722
我们赌的是同一件事 各位
We're betting on the same thing,boys.

340
00:20:54,823 --> 00:20:56,242
禁酒令真的会撤销
That repeal is going to happen.

341
00:20:56,343 --> 00:20:58,335
也许是真的 但没有议员...
That may be true,but without the senator...

342
00:20:58,445 --> 00:21:00,749
我会劝议员回心转意
I'll get the senator back onboard.

343
00:21:01,896 --> 00:21:03,623
我很确定
I'm fairly certain

344
00:21:03,726 --> 00:21:06,357
我们都知道这是不可能的事
we both know that's not gonna happen.

345
00:21:06,485 --> 00:21:09,344
但真的很感谢你能来
We do appreciate your coming in,however.

346
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,065
我也曾做过这生意 知道吗
I made the same deal,you know.

347
00:21:25,228 --> 00:21:26,385
什么 
Excuse me?

348
00:21:26,528 --> 00:21:27,970
穿越大西洋
Across the pond.

349
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:30,866
等这国家的人想通后 进口杜瓦瓶
To import Dewar's when the country returns to its senses.

350
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,469
还有酩悦香槟 
Moet Champagne as well.

351
00:21:33,021 --> 00:21:34,725
这想法很棒 
Great minds,I suppose.

352
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,264
您结婚了吗 汤普森先生
Married,Mr. Thompson?

353
00:21:38,198 --> 00:21:40,337
理论上是 情况很复杂
Technically. It's complicated.

354
00:21:41,304 --> 00:21:43,878
偷腥是人之常情
Well,affairs of the heart always are.

355
00:21:45,569 --> 00:21:47,673
所以你的合伙人们
So your partners,

356
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:49,385
那只是审批程序
was that just a vetting process

357
00:21:49,513 --> 00:21:51,521
还是我该选择其它出口
or should I find some other doorway to darken?

358
00:21:51,628 --> 00:21:53,550
你这样的人让他们很害怕
A man like you frightens them.

359
00:21:53,662 --> 00:21:55,532
这些人是社会精英 不会大吼大叫
These are Brahmins,not brawlers.

360
00:21:55,638 --> 00:21:57,723
你倒没有很慌乱
Well,you don't seem particularly rattled.

361
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:01,191
大西洋帝国
Atlantic City.

362
00:22:01,324 --> 00:22:03,415
下次登门拜访时会联系您
I'll ring you up next time I visit.

363
00:22:03,548 --> 00:22:05,018
汤普森先生
Mr. Thompson.

364
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,908
肯尼迪先生
Mr. Kennedy.

365
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:19,404
多里奥传信说 马拉暂罗想见你
Torrio sent word. Maranzano wants to meet.

366
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:34,417
下午好 女士们
Ah,afternoon,my ladies.

367
00:22:34,969 --> 00:22:38,191
-你们的皇家车夫正在等候  -真是豪华
-Your royal coachman awaits. -Oh,how regal.

368
00:22:39,543 --> 00:22:43,314
#暮色时分唱支歌#
#Just a song at twilight#

369
00:22:43,466 --> 00:22:46,693
#现已是天色昏暗#
# When the lights are low#

370
00:22:46,796 --> 00:22:49,914
#黑影摇曳#
#And the flickering shadows#

371
00:22:50,258 --> 00:22:53,381
#轻轻的来往#
#Softly come and go..#

372
00:22:53,503 --> 00:22:55,746
还有小夜曲
And a serenade as well.

373
00:22:56,529 --> 00:22:59,580
#也许是身心疲惫#
#Though the heart be weary#

374
00:22:59,716 --> 00:23:02,941
#度过冗长一天#
#Sad the day and long#

375
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:07,564
#但在这暮色之下#
#Still to us at twilight...#

376
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,039
看看 这是谁
Well,look who it is.

377
00:23:10,148 --> 00:23:12,820
没有你 地球都不转了
The linchpin of the entire organization.

378
00:23:13,028 --> 00:23:14,895
对不起 我迟到了 先生
Sorry I'm tardy,sir.

379
00:23:15,469 --> 00:23:18,037
确实是
So you are. So you are.

380
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:19,423
我很担心
I was worried sick.

381
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:20,938
是的 先生
Yes,sir.

382
00:23:21,171 --> 00:23:22,325
其实 卢...
Actually,Lou...

383
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,651
我们这是在做生意 孩子
We're running a business,boy.

384
00:23:24,931 --> 00:23:26,716
你是其中的关键
You're a critical part of the operation.

385
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,891
你不能想来就来 想走就走
You can't just come and go willy-nilly.

386
00:23:29,025 --> 00:23:31,222
-不是的 先生  -沙子会自己变没吗 
-No,sir. - You think that sand will sweep itself?

387
00:23:31,329 --> 00:23:34,851
为什么 你不出现 这里都一片混乱了
Why,you don't show up,this whole place descends into chaos.

388
00:23:34,961 --> 00:23:37,654
整个酒店都前途未卜
The very future of this hotel hanging in the balance.

389
00:23:37,758 --> 00:23:39,502
-也许...  -我妹过世了
- Maybe... -My sister passed.

390
00:23:39,638 --> 00:23:42,513
-什么  -我妹 先生
-What? - My sister,sir.

391
00:23:44,188 --> 00:23:47,191
她昨晚死去了
She died last night

392
00:23:47,898 --> 00:23:49,999
当时我们都在睡觉
while we were sleeping.

393
00:23:54,185 --> 00:23:57,238
有什么下葬仪式 要做弥撒吗
Are there services? A mass?

394
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:59,901
-我想去表示一下敬意  -没有 先生
-I'd like to pay my respects. -No,sir.

395
00:24:00,446 --> 00:24:03,973
神父主持最后的仪式 我们想把她葬在家里
The Father came for last rites,but we're burying her at home.

396
00:24:07,687 --> 00:24:09,117
你该送点什么东西
You should send something.

397
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:12,229
为什么 他家老爷子觉得我很坏
What for? Kid's old man thinks I'm a devil.

398
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:14,360
他也是选民 不是吗
He votes,don't he?

399
00:24:20,336 --> 00:24:22,485
真是悲剧 失去妹妹
A tragedy,losing a sister.

400
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,925
好了 那就去到工作中找安慰吧
All right,then,go on. Find solace in your work.

401
00:24:50,391 --> 00:24:51,377
爸爸 
Say,Dad.

402
00:24:54,836 --> 00:24:55,676
什么
What is it?

403
00:24:55,788 --> 00:24:58,862
为什么云朵能漂浮在空中
Why do clouds just float in the sky?

404
00:25:01,175 --> 00:25:02,185
这是笑话吗
Is this a joke?

405
00:25:02,305 --> 00:25:04,103
是为科学课做准备
It's for science class.

406
00:25:04,233 --> 00:25:06,052
去问你母亲
Go ask your mother.

407
00:25:06,167 --> 00:25:07,364
她让我来问你
She said to ask you.

408
00:25:07,379 --> 00:25:10,972
我很忙 切斯特 你看得见 不是吗
I'm busy,Chester.You can see that,can't you?

409
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:19,428
云朵漂浮...
Clouds float...

410
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,908
是因为大气
because of the atmosphere.

411
00:25:26,189 --> 00:25:28,541
-可是...  -别问了 上楼去
-But... -Shoo! Upstairs.

412

413
00:25:44,488 --> 00:25:47,345
爸爸说 是因为大气

416
00:25:55,803 --> 00:25:59,016
抽烟完全不淑女
That is a thoroughly unladylike habit.

417

420
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:12,854
-我何时回来  -我就是这么说的
-When will I be home? -This is what I say.

不 你说的是"你啥时候回来" 完全不一样...
No, what you said was,"When you will be home?" which is entirely...

422
00:26:16,371 --> 00:26:17,944
有何区别
What is difference?

423
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:21,739
区别在于 我在教孩子们说标准英语

改变现有事物

430
00:26:57,688 --> 00:27:00,016
并创造类似的新事物
and to make new things like them.

汤普森先生 你信奉马可 奥里利乌斯(西方哲学家)的哲学吗
You're a student of Marcus Aurelius, Mr. Thompson?

我更支持本 富兰克林(美国著名的政治家 科学家)
I'm more of a Ben Franklin man myself.

很顽固
he was stubborn.

438
00:27:18,175 --> 00:27:19,821
非常倔
Like a mule.

439
00:27:20,752 --> 00:27:24,456
而倔强的他 只懂得来硬的
And like a mule, he only understood the switch.

440
00:27:24,848 --> 00:27:26,224
暴力
Violence.

441
00:27:27,384 --> 00:27:29,486
这些 你都非常了解
But you know this all too well.

442
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:34,430
我跟马拉暂罗先生讲了你的事情
I brought Mr. Maranzano up to speed with your history.

443
00:27:35,246 --> 00:27:37,276
我们确实有过冲突
It's true we had our difficulties.

444
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:40,996
我努力跟这家伙理论 不知多少次了
How many times I try to reason with the man?

445
00:27:41,753 --> 00:27:43,089
结果呢
And for what?

446
00:27:43,503 --> 00:27:45,210

A goose egg.

447

闹翻了
A falling out?

452
00:27:56,743 --> 00:27:59,572
关系可破裂 友谊可终结
People drift. Friendships end.

453
00:27:59,927 --> 00:28:02,405
可交新朋友
And new ones are forged.

454
00:28:06,388 --> 00:28:08,071
也可易主
Allegiances change as well.

455
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:11,999
人的价值取决于野心
A man's worth is no greater than his ambitions.

456
00:28:13,613 --> 00:28:16,505
托尼诺是个好孩子

462

00:28:39,545 --> 00:28:42,228
汤普森先生 你不用怕我
You have nothing to fear from me, Mr. Thompson.

465
00:28:43,468 --> 00:28:45,359
谁说我害怕了
Who said I was afraid?

466
00:28:55,365 --> 00:28:57,144
我该不该信他
So do I believe him or not?

467
00:28:57,788 --> 00:29:00,580
无论如何 你要相信这事让你脱离困境
Believe whatever it is gets you out of this mess.

等他出来再动手

471
00:29:23,953 --> 00:29:26,700
相信我 他不会挣扎

差不多六年了
Six years or so.

477
00:29:41,652 --> 00:29:43,890
我们隔三差五还约见
I mean, we arrange to see each other now and again,

478
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:45,757
但很艰难
but it's hard.

479
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:50,972
你心里还有她

00:29:54,576 --> 00:29:57,089
我只惦记她和孩子
All I think about are her and the kids.

482
00:30:01,604 --> 00:30:04,831
有时 我觉得 恨人比爱人
Sometimes I find it easier to despise someone

483
00:30:05,101 --> 00:30:07,144
要容易
than to love them.

484
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:18,409
这家伙在哪

485
00:30:24,476 --> 00:30:27,104

冷静 谁都别受伤
Steady now and no one gets hurt.

487
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:29,916
伙计 知道你在抢谁吗
You know who you're robbing, pal?

488
00:30:30,164 --> 00:30:32,381
彼得 付保罗的钱
Peter. To pay Paul.

489
00:30:34,021 --> 00:30:35,831
怎么回事
What the fuck?

490
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:38,653
我说了 冷静

为何总是一团糟

你听过那谜语吗

旅者和两个部落成员
the traveler and the two tribesmen?

505
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:28,126
一个总撒谎 另一个总说真话
One always lies, the other always tells the truth.

506
00:31:30,316 --> 00:31:33,896
我沉默 他们又来找我
I lay down, they come after me again.

507
00:31:34,033 --> 00:31:36,016
我回击...
I fight back...

508
00:31:37,989 --> 00:31:40,932
今天我碰到了一个爱尔兰人

赚的是黑心钱吗
Think he's wading through blood to make a buck?

512
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:59,352
有时候 因为你已选择
You get to the point where you

513
00:32:00,345 --> 00:32:02,765
必须坚持下去
have to live with the choices you've made.

不管是好是坏

515

我同意
And I accept that.

516
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:11,618
我就快成功了 该死 那么近

酒的交易一旦成了 我就会很富

Then the trick's to stay alive long enough to cash out.

519

你根本就不知道我在说什么 是吧
You haven't the slightest idea what I'm talking about,do you?

是
Sí.

521
00:32:29,495 --> 00:32:32,711
是知道 还是不知道
Sí,you do,or sí,you don't?

522
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:38,230
有何区别
What's the difference?

523
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:51,681
如果你喝一杯 就会显得有道理多了
If you'd have a drink, I'd make a lot more sense.

524
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:03,169
到底有没有要说的
Do you have anything to say at all?

525

我杀他们 我不杀他们

听你吩咐

他怀疑了吗
Is he suspicious?

545
00:34:11,384 --> 00:34:13,538
他就那样 胆战心惊 时刻警惕

他认为你们意见不和 离开了
You ask me,he believes you fellas are on the outs.

550
00:34:23,106 --> 00:34:24,269
什么依据
Based on what?

551
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,269
没什么 不知道 个人之见
Nothing. I don't know. My opinion.

552
00:34:26,584 --> 00:34:29,571
-我可不喜欢 查理  -放松
-I don't like this,Charlie. -Relax.

553
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,526

554
00:34:33,548 --> 00:34:34,828
你非得找汤普森谈谈
You had to talk to Thompson?

555
00:34:35,632 --> 00:34:37,959
-在该死的哈瓦那(古巴城市)  -我该怎么做
-Down in fucking Havana. -What should I have done?

556
00:34:38,063 --> 00:34:39,980
天啊 也许别跟他说了
Gee,maybe not fucking talk to him?

557
00:34:40,108 --> 00:34:43,065
他看到我了 本尼 最好面对
He saw me,Benny. Better to face it head-on.

558
00:34:43,183 --> 00:34:45,465
把你的鼻子伸到不该去的地方

559
00:34:45,564 --> 00:34:47,328
做个好孩子

560
00:34:47,444 --> 00:34:48,972
别烦人们

561
00:34:49,068 --> 00:34:50,588
这难道也算过分吗

562
00:34:50,692 --> 00:34:52,193
该死的神经病
Hey,fuck you, you fucking screwball!

563
00:34:52,305 --> 00:34:53,423
够了
Enough.

564
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:56,908
马拉暂罗以为 迈耶是自己要干掉汤普森
As far as Maranzano knows,Meyer took it on himself to ice Thompson.

565
00:34:57,009 --> 00:34:58,665
谁知道那该死的外国佬怎么想的
Who knows what that fucking greaseball thinks?

566
00:34:58,768 --> 00:35:01,339
我说我们马上行动 把他杀了
I say we move now. Just take him the fuck out.

567
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,224
太快了 没人支持我们
It's too soon. We don't got the support.

568
00:35:04,322 --> 00:35:07,052

王子街 我接管

我做到了 你说过会考虑
I did the thing,you said you'd think about it.

572
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:15,560
马塞里亚还没死呢
Masseria ain't even in the fucking ground yet.

573
00:35:15,664 --> 00:35:17,403
我知道 只是提醒一下
I know. I'm just reminding you.

574
00:35:21,567 --> 00:35:25,024
回楼上去 找人上床去
Go back upstairs. Get yourself a rim job.

575
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,750
对我发什么火
What are you sore at me for?

576
00:35:29,566 --> 00:35:31,856
一会儿聊 好吗
We'll catch up later,okay?

577
00:35:39,367 --> 00:35:41,880
他是个真正的笨蛋
He's a real fucking schnorrer,this one.

578
00:35:42,709 --> 00:35:44,424
对 他没事
Yeah,he's all right.

579
00:35:44,603 --> 00:35:46,526
跟吉普 罗塞蒂去说吧
Tell it to Gyp Rosetti.

580
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:05,154
怎么回事
What's this now?

581
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:14,346
伊桑
Ethan.

582
00:36:15,558 --> 00:36:17,123
你想怎么样
What do you want?

583
00:36:18,553 --> 00:36:21,437
我来问候你
I've come to pay my respects to you,

584
00:36:21,527 --> 00:36:22,594
还有你的妻子
your wife.

585
00:36:22,687 --> 00:36:24,196
确实很悲伤
It's a terrible blow.

586
00:36:24,289 --> 00:36:25,912
她不在
She's not here.

587
00:36:25,996 --> 00:36:28,324
你孩子都告诉我了
Your boy told me what happened.

588
00:36:28,393 --> 00:36:30,175
青天化日下 白白失去一个无辜的孩子
Is there anything worse under God's blue heaven

589
00:36:30,278 --> 00:36:32,636
真是太糟糕了
than the loss of an innocent child?

590
00:36:43,293 --> 00:36:44,810
那是什么
What's that?

591
00:36:44,968 --> 00:36:47,221
让你的女儿体面下葬
To give your daughter a proper burial.

592
00:36:47,707 --> 00:36:50,227
你以为能收买我两次吗
Think you can buy me twice?

593
00:36:50,336 --> 00:36:53,043
那是公平交易 伊桑
It was a fair deal,Ethan.

594
00:36:53,152 --> 00:36:55,832
没人强迫你卖掉土地

595
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:14,307
今天放假 孩子 和你的家人在一起

-别激动  -爸
-Easy there. -Pa.

598
00:37:27,575 --> 00:37:30,353
该死 你剥夺了我所有的财产
You get the hell off my property.

599
00:37:30,977 --> 00:37:34,159
我没有你认为的那么坏 伊桑
I'm not the monster that you think I am,Ethan.

600
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:13,129
他怎么样 霍奇  
What's he like? Hodge?

601
00:38:13,543 --> 00:38:14,985
他爽快
Well,he's direct,

602
00:38:15,817 --> 00:38:17,481
坚强 热心
tough,earnest.

603
00:38:18,015 --> 00:38:20,234
让我想起了泰迪 罗斯福(美国第26任总统)
Sort of reminded me of Teddy Roosevelt.

604

希望他不用手杖

面试时 他们会问你这些问题

606
00:38:29,105 --> 00:38:31,155

607
00:38:31,253 --> 00:38:34,070
为了抓人你会违法吗

608
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,785
就那些事
That type of thing.

609
00:38:38,088 --> 00:38:39,750
有提到我吗
My name come up?

610
00:38:40,574 --> 00:38:41,538
什么
Excuse me?

611
00:38:41,676 --> 00:38:43,534
面试的时候
During the interview.

612

没有
No.

613
00:38:46,654 --> 00:38:47,954
当然没有
'Course not.

614
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,610
提到了我也不会以此为耻
I wouldn't be ashamed if it did.

615
00:38:49,762 --> 00:38:50,950
你很高尚
Well,that's very noble,

616
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:53,239
但你要为将来考虑
but you've got a future to think about.

617
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:54,944
威廉 汤普森
William H. Thompson,

618
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:57,198
最高法院首席法官
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

619
00:38:57,388 --> 00:39:00,220
只要你不是新泽西司法部长
So long as you're not the Attorney General of New Jersey.

620
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,278
鸡肉你几乎没动
You hardly touched your chicken.

621
00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:11,519
我吃好了
I'm okay.

622
00:39:18,821 --> 00:39:21,531
威尔 我为你感到骄傲 我们都是

630
00:39:52,046 --> 00:39:53,680
七十九
79.

631
00:39:53,795 --> 00:39:56,293
米勒 你去哪了

632
00:39:56,528 --> 00:39:58,563
在密歇根出了意外
There was an accident on Michigan.

633
00:39:58,673 --> 00:40:00,998

"卷心菜"
Cabbage.

635
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:08,326
小心 佛瑞德
Watch it,Fred.

636
00:40:08,446 --> 00:40:10,540
可能有蟑螂 准备好拍死它
There might be a cockroach ready to pounce.

637
00:40:10,665 --> 00:40:13,284
一点都不好笑 到处都是臭虫
That's not funny. There's bugs everywhere.

638
00:40:14,388 --> 00:40:17,606
-四十二  -十四
-42. - 14.

639
00:40:18,236 --> 00:40:20,614
-七十二  -九
-72. -Nine.

640
00:40:20,863 --> 00:40:23,099
两个胖夫人(丰厚之意) 八十八

641
00:40:25,485 --> 00:40:26,933
最后 朋友们

改变世界不能谦顺的绵羊 要靠战士
it's not the meek who change the world,but the fighters,

643
00:40:29,904 --> 00:40:31,222
信仰者
the believers.

644
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,748
芝加哥现在面临险境
The city of Chicago is at a great precipice,

645
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:36,163
摇摆在善恶边缘
teetering on the brink between good and evil.

646
00:40:36,264 --> 00:40:39,062
我在此起誓 与卡彭(美国黑手党老大)暴徒斗争到底
So I vow to fight the Capone mob,

647
00:40:39,206 --> 00:40:41,914
不退出 不逃避
not bow out,not walk away,

648
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:44,962
不投降 不放弃 战斗到底

为了天下父母

650

为了这座城市的学童

651
00:40:48,667 --> 00:40:50,163
但内斯先生 您将从何处着手
Yeah,but,Mr. Ness, how are you gonna go about this?

652
00:40:50,355 --> 00:40:53,343
如果有人说反抗根本不是办法
And if anyone says that to fight doesn't get you anywhere,

653
00:40:54,203 --> 00:40:57,328
财政部探员单枪匹马 根本毫无作用
that a lone treasury agent can't make a difference,

654
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,123
卡彭一伙太过强大
that the Capone machine is too powerful,

655
00:41:00,222 --> 00:41:02,395
那是因为他们不了解艾略特 内斯
then I say they don't know Eliot Ness.

656
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,544
-谁  -我是威尔逊
-Who is it? -It's Wilson.

657
00:41:37,551 --> 00:41:39,103
-有进展吗  -是的 先生

658
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:42,290
钻石皮带扣一万四

员工圣诞礼物

660
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,314
而我只有差劲的香槟一瓶
All I got was a lousy bottle of champagne.

661
00:41:47,456 --> 00:41:49,064
休伦的妓院
The cathouse on Huron.

662
00:41:49,272 --> 00:41:51,067
早上交给我完整解析报告
I'd like a full breakdown by morning.

663
00:42:16,118 --> 00:42:17,055
先生
Se?or

664
00:42:18,314 --> 00:42:20,874
汤普森先生 他找你
Mr. Thompson, he wants you.

665
00:42:28,435 --> 00:42:29,460
渴吗
Thirsty?

666
00:42:30,634 --> 00:42:32,943
说实话 是紧张
Nervous,speaking frankly.

667
00:42:33,271 --> 00:42:37,047
只是在公共场合叙叙旧而已
Just a friendly conversation in a very public place.

668
00:42:37,954 --> 00:42:40,335
邀请方式让我很慌乱
It was the invitation got me rattled.

669
00:42:43,881 --> 00:42:46,310
不要管他 他很听话
Don't mind him. He's a pussycat.

670
00:42:48,401 --> 00:42:50,028
你想知道什么
What do you want to know?

671
00:42:50,186 --> 00:42:53,736
告诉我是谁坏了我的假期
How about you tell me who it was spoiled my vacation?

672
00:42:54,362 --> 00:42:56,988
光是跟你说话我就可能被杀掉
You know I could get killed for just talking to you.

673
00:42:57,266 --> 00:42:59,432
你不说也是死
And you will be if you don't.

674
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:03,202
是兰斯基和卢西亚诺
It was Lansky and Luciano.

675
00:43:03,309 --> 00:43:05,971
他们在等待机会 让马拉暂罗觉得他才是王
They're gonna bide their time, let Maranzano think he's king.

676
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,427
只要有足够拥护者...
Then the minute they got enough support...

677
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:09,232
他的统治就会结束
His reign is over.

678
00:43:09,947 --> 00:43:12,917
他们也会杀了我 我知道
They're gonna take me out,too. I fucking know it.

679
00:43:14,314 --> 00:43:17,039
他们一旦成功 就会给我背后来一刀
Put the knife in my back the second they get the chance.

680
00:43:17,143 --> 00:43:19,282
但你入了马塞里亚一伙
But you were on board with the Masseria hit.

681
00:43:19,391 --> 00:43:23,039
我别无选择 要么赞成要么死
What choice did I have? It was go along or else.

682
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:27,057
马拉暂罗对你没意见
Maranzano's got no beef with you.

683
00:43:27,156 --> 00:43:30,135
对他而言 大西洋城是你的
As far as he's concerned, Atlantic City's yours.

684
00:43:30,265 --> 00:43:33,071
我只要守住已有的即可
I can keep what's already mine?

685
00:43:33,215 --> 00:43:34,976
多么慷慨
How exceedingly generous.

686
00:43:35,069 --> 00:43:37,341
比另外两个慷慨多了
A lot more so than the other two.

687
00:43:38,621 --> 00:43:40,520
马拉暂罗知道他们的计划吗
Does Maranzano know what they're planning?

688
00:43:40,624 --> 00:43:43,797
如果他知道 早就阻止了

756
00:49:59,802 --> 00:50:02,189
因为你在精神病院 亲爱的
