1
00:00:18,224 --> 00:00:23,094
Balance is what human beings chase after
when they are babies learning how to walk.

2
00:00:23,096 --> 00:00:28,114
Although people gradually forget this
after they can walk and run,

3
00:00:28,116 --> 00:00:31,504
balance is always there with us.

4
00:00:31,506 --> 00:00:34,354
Keeping the idea of balance in mind,

5
00:00:34,357 --> 00:00:37,834
one can walk easily even if 
he/she is climbing rocky mountain ways;

6
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:41,591
forgetting about balance, one
can accidentally make such a childish

7
00:00:41,594 --> 00:00:45,814
mistake and fall on a flat road though he/she has grown up.

8
00:00:45,817 --> 00:00:50,774
When people walk in a hurry,
they may think balance is a natural instinct,

9
00:00:50,777 --> 00:00:54,434
but actually it is one goal that we pursue.

10
00:00:54,437 --> 00:00:58,054
Several legends all explain how Go originated.

11
00:00:58,057 --> 00:01:01,694
In the book of Natural History (Bowuzhi in Chinese),

12
00:01:01,697 --> 00:01:04,974
it says the Emperor of Shun invented Go to teach his son wisdom.

13
00:01:04,977 --> 00:01:07,444
In Postscript of Hearsay History (Lushihouji in Chinese),

14
00:01:07,447 --> 00:01:10,471
the hero became the Emperor of Yao,

15
00:01:10,474 --> 00:01:14,364
who made Go as a tool
to teach his son how to be pure and virtuous.

16
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:17,454
An ancient tomb of the Liao Dynasty in Inner Mongolia

17
00:01:17,457 --> 00:01:20,694
has unearthed the endgame of Go in a game:

18
00:01:20,697 --> 00:01:23,034
the Go board has a 13¡Á13 grid of lines,

19
00:01:23,037 --> 00:01:28,064
and there are several white stones and black stones on the board.

20
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:31,994
Let's learn something about the Go board.

21
00:01:31,997 --> 00:01:34,564
There are several vertical and horizontal lines

22
00:01:34,567 --> 00:01:37,914
intersected with each other on the board.

23
00:01:37,917 --> 00:01:44,474
One player uses black stones
(the playing pieces) and the other, white.

24
00:01:44,477 --> 00:01:48,614
The players take turns placing the stones

25
00:01:48,617 --> 00:01:54,244
on the vacant intersections of the board.

26
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:58,754
Hunan Province has also excavated
an ancient tomb of the Tang Dynasty.

27
00:01:58,757 --> 00:02:01,454
There is also a chess board among the funeral objects.

28
00:02:01,457 --> 00:02:06,034
This chess board has a 15¡Á15 grid of lines.

29
00:02:06,037 --> 00:02:09,874
Since its appearance,

30
00:02:09,877 --> 00:02:12,824
the Go board evolved for several times.

31
00:02:12,827 --> 00:02:15,814
In the early time, there was a 11¡Á11 grid of lines,

32
00:02:15,817 --> 00:02:18,864
then 13¡Á13, and also 15¡Á15.

33
00:02:18,867 --> 00:02:22,014
In the end of the Han Dynasty
and the beginning of the Tang Dynasty,

34
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:25,134
the board gradually changed from a 17¡Á17 style

35
00:02:25,137 --> 00:02:28,704
to the 19¡Á19 grid which now we use.

36
00:02:28,934 --> 00:02:34,934
You may ask such a question:
why do the lines keep increasing 

37
00:02:34,937 --> 00:02:40,204
and will the current board continue to change?

38
00:02:40,207 --> 00:02:46,364
Another more direct question is
that from the point of playing the game,

39
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:54,284
how many lines should there have vertically and horizontally?

40
00:02:54,287 --> 00:02:57,674
Let's see the literal meaning of Go, Weiqi in Chinese.

41
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:01,104
It means encirclement board game.

42
00:03:01,107 --> 00:03:06,684
The one who has surrounded more territory wins the game.

43
00:03:07,724 --> 00:03:16,234
As we said just now, go can be played at the intersection.

44
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:23,754
The Go board consists of crisscrossing lines.

45
00:03:23,984 --> 00:03:26,894
According to the distance from the boundary,

46
00:03:27,354 --> 00:03:29,844
the four edges are called Line 1.

47
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:37,924
The lines adjacent to the edges are called Line 2,

48
00:03:37,924 --> 00:03:42,574
and the upper lines are Line 3 and Line 4.

49
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:46,924
The points on each line have the relatively same characteristics

50
00:03:46,924 --> 00:03:51,464
due to the same distance to the edge.

51
00:03:52,284 --> 00:03:57,534
We can see that the white stones are on Line 3,

52
00:03:57,534 --> 00:04:02,444
and the blacks are on Line 4 in this picture.

53
00:04:03,334 --> 00:04:06,854
Playing Go is not only about occupying your own land,

54
00:04:06,854 --> 00:04:10,154
but also to grab someone else's territory.

55
00:04:10,154 --> 00:04:14,724
In other words, you can kill your enemy's pieces

56
00:04:14,724 --> 00:04:19,724
and take the place occupied by the other as your own.

57
00:04:19,934 --> 00:04:23,424
For example, if we look at this situation,

58
00:04:23,424 --> 00:04:28,244
the White player has three stones,
but they do not completely surround the Black.

59
00:04:28,244 --> 00:04:31,554
It's surrounded on three sides

60
00:04:31,824 --> 00:04:35,424
The White player only needs to drop stone at point A,

61
00:04:35,424 --> 00:04:39,264
then the black stone is surrounded, and the sunspot is captured.

62
00:04:39,264 --> 00:04:44,504
The star occupied by the black stone is owned by the White player,

63
00:04:44,504 --> 00:04:51,504
and the black stone is killed by the white stones.

64
00:04:51,504 --> 00:04:59,004
So we call it as the white kills the black.

65
00:04:59,004 --> 00:05:04,644
Therefore, Go has a problem with life and death.

66
00:05:05,194 --> 00:05:08,964
When the stones are enclosed in open space,

67
00:05:08,964 --> 00:05:11,474
they must ensure that they could survive,

68
00:05:11,474 --> 00:05:16,564
and at least two independent "point"(mu in Chinese) can be formed.

69
00:05:16,564 --> 00:05:25,674
We can simply understand the "point" as two empty areas.

70
00:05:25,824 --> 00:05:28,594
For example, we look at this graph.

71
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:33,154
Although the white stones are surrounded by the black ones,

72
00:05:33,154 --> 00:05:40,734
it has two separate "points", which are also called "eyes".

73
00:05:40,734 --> 00:05:48,694
At this time, we said that white survived.

74
00:05:48,694 --> 00:05:54,774
Why do you have to have two "eyes" to survive?

75
00:05:54,774 --> 00:05:58,144
Can't one "eye" still work?

76
00:05:58,144 --> 00:06:01,844
Let's look at such a question to see
what may happen if there is only one point.

77
00:06:01,844 --> 00:06:04,024
The white stones surround the black ones,

78
00:06:04,024 --> 00:06:07,914
and the Black also has a point.

79
00:06:07,914 --> 00:06:10,504
At this moment, the Black cannot survive.

80
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:14,294
Why? Because the White can throw in (dianyan in Chinese),

81
00:06:14,294 --> 00:06:17,814
that is, place a stone in the empty space surrounded by black stones.

82
00:06:17,814 --> 00:06:21,524
Now, the black stones are pincered both insides and outsides,

83
00:06:21,524 --> 00:06:24,484
both inside and outside are surrounded

84
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:28,104
At this time, the Black is killed,

85
00:06:28,104 --> 00:06:34,944
and these places are owned by the White.

86
00:06:39,264 --> 00:06:48,604
Since we just talked about that the points
on the same side have the same characteristics.

87
00:06:48,604 --> 00:06:52,924
Let's look at the second, third and fourth lines.

88
00:06:52,924 --> 00:06:57,524
What are the characteristics of these lines?

89
00:06:57,814 --> 00:07:00,884
From the perspective of the game,

90
00:07:00,884 --> 00:07:05,514
the priority is to ensure that the stones
you are playing are not killed by your opponent.

91
00:07:05,514 --> 00:07:11,664
So which line can form a living pattern at the fastest speed?"

92
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:18,434
So the best way is to rely on natural insurance which is edge.

93
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,014
There is an advantage in playing chess near the edge:

94
00:07:21,014 --> 00:07:25,684
you can create your territory without placing stones.

95
00:07:25,684 --> 00:07:34,524
We use fewer stones to
form a chess piece by using the edge than that in the center,

96
00:07:34,764 --> 00:07:42,844
that is to say, we can use fewer stones to acquire more territories.

97
00:07:42,844 --> 00:07:48,454
Just now we talked about the theory of survival.

98
00:07:48,454 --> 00:07:52,264
Now, we have the fastest living chess pieces on the second, third and fourth lines.

99
00:07:52,264 --> 00:08:00,904
we found that we only use 7 stones
to form a living piece on the third line,

100
00:08:00,904 --> 00:08:08,014
while on the second and fourth lines, we use 8 stones.

101
00:08:08,014 --> 00:08:11,814
Of course, we will use more stones on the fifth and sixth lines.

102
00:08:12,004 --> 00:08:20,054
Thus, from the perspective of the being alive at the fastest speed,

103
00:08:20,054 --> 00:08:24,494
the third line is the best.

104
00:08:24,494 --> 00:08:33,333
So, the third line is a very important line of occupying the edges and corners.

105
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:37,193
By taking the third line, we can acquire edges and corners,

106
00:08:37,193 --> 00:08:42,023
and by taking the fourth line, we can naturally control the center.

107
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:46,663
So, the fourth line is very important to control the center.

108
00:08:46,663 --> 00:08:52,333
The 19 lines in each side on the board we use
now have been tested for over one thousand years.

109
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:57,213
The number of lines has its own rationality.

110
00:08:57,213 --> 00:09:01,133
Where is the rationality?

111
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:07,173
Mainly reflected in sente (the first one) and
gote (the second one) to play the game

112
00:09:07,173 --> 00:09:10,283
and acquiring territory without any difference.

113
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:13,883
In fact, according to the current rules of Go, komi should be followed,

114
00:09:13,883 --> 00:09:18,013
that is, a bonus in score given to white
as compensation for going second.

115
00:09:18,013 --> 00:09:21,503
But in ancient China, there was no such thing as komi.

116
00:09:21,503 --> 00:09:25,043
You can play fair by no komi,

117
00:09:25,043 --> 00:09:28,673
that means that going first would not gain advantages.

118
00:09:28,673 --> 00:09:31,673
Even if you go first and occupy five points first,

119
00:09:31,673 --> 00:09:34,363
I go second but can also occupy five points.

120
00:09:34,363 --> 00:09:38,043
Then you have no advantage in going first.

121
00:09:38,043 --> 00:09:42,653
Therefore, we speculate that
from the perspective of territory occupation,

122
00:09:42,544 --> 00:09:46,103
there must be two kinds of counter-forces inside Go

123
00:09:46,103 --> 00:09:51,513
to ensure the fairness of the territory occupation of sente and gote.
