1
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:32,271
Hey.

2
00:00:38,454 --> 00:00:40,046
Bye!

3
00:00:42,725 --> 00:00:45,057
Bouquet? Bouquet.

4
00:00:45,227 --> 00:00:46,216
Beautiful, isn't it?

5
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:49,290
But let me tell you the truth.

6
00:00:49,798 --> 00:00:54,167
For a lot of people, marriage is like
sticking your tongue on a frozen flagpole.

7
00:00:54,336 --> 00:00:57,100
It looks like fun when you see
friends doing it, so you say:

8
00:00:57,272 --> 00:01:00,139
"Hey, I'll give it a try.
Just once."

9
00:01:00,309 --> 00:01:03,540
Next thing you know, you're stuck.

10
00:01:03,712 --> 00:01:05,179
Full of regret.

11
00:01:05,347 --> 00:01:07,838
Praying, "Please get me
out of this with my dignity...

12
00:01:08,016 --> 00:01:10,985
...if least not my extremities, intact."

13
00:01:11,153 --> 00:01:13,348
But it doesn't have to be
like that, my friends.

14
00:01:13,522 --> 00:01:16,650
It does not have to be like that.

15
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:18,383
That's where I come in.

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,028
Good marriages are my business.

17
00:01:21,396 --> 00:01:23,387
Meeting the right person
in the first place?

18
00:01:23,565 --> 00:01:26,329
Well, my friends, that is up to you.

19
00:01:26,502 --> 00:01:27,969
Oh, I'm sorry.

20
00:01:28,137 --> 00:01:31,265
- I'll go.
- Yeah, you go. Okay.

21
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:50,214
- Hi. I'm Sadie.
- Hi. Ben.

22
00:01:50,392 --> 00:01:52,622
From that first, destined meeting...

23
00:01:53,162 --> 00:01:56,188
...to the sweet innocence
of the first date.

24
00:02:01,136 --> 00:02:03,468
- Are you skipping to second base?
- What's that? No.

25
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:05,368
You know why? I'm not a skipper.

26
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:10,478
Maybe we should take care of first base,
just to make things right.

27
00:02:13,148 --> 00:02:15,241
The first kiss.

28
00:02:15,918 --> 00:02:18,386
The first time you say "I love you."

29
00:02:18,554 --> 00:02:20,283
- I love you.
- What?

30
00:02:20,455 --> 00:02:23,083
What? A view.
What a view.

31
00:02:23,258 --> 00:02:26,819
First time you say "I love you,"
and she actually hears you.

32
00:02:26,995 --> 00:02:28,485
I love you.

33
00:02:30,098 --> 00:02:33,226
- I'm afraid you're not my type.
- I love you too.

34
00:02:40,008 --> 00:02:42,568
You seriously didn't think I was
gonna let you see that?

35
00:02:43,445 --> 00:02:46,107
Let's skip to the next thing:
Moving in together.

36
00:02:46,281 --> 00:02:50,240
The first time she finds something
you don't want her to see.

37
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,551
- Don't worry, I got the heavy ones.
- "Dear Mr. Brian Boitano."

38
00:02:54,723 --> 00:02:57,453
- Oh, God!
- "Congratulations on your triple Axel.

39
00:02:57,993 --> 00:02:59,984
I wonder how much
you practice every week...

40
00:03:00,162 --> 00:03:03,996
...and also how you make your hair
stay like that."

41
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,600
Hey, he was a legend. Okay?

42
00:03:06,768 --> 00:03:09,601
I mean, even at age 9 I knew that.

43
00:03:10,005 --> 00:03:12,838
I'm gonna get a less embarrassing box.
Okay.

44
00:03:13,008 --> 00:03:15,442
If she doesn't dump your
wussy ass after that...

45
00:03:16,645 --> 00:03:19,205
...then comes the big one: The proposal.

46
00:03:30,058 --> 00:03:31,218
Sadie...

47
00:03:31,393 --> 00:03:32,985
...you're a great girl. You are.

48
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:35,527
And I think it's time that
you and I were man and...

49
00:03:35,697 --> 00:03:37,688
Lame. That is so lame.

50
00:03:41,837 --> 00:03:45,204
We are so pleased all of you
could be here with us today...

51
00:03:45,374 --> 00:03:49,606
...to celebrate our 30 years of marriage.

52
00:03:49,778 --> 00:03:51,040
Cheers.

53
00:03:53,548 --> 00:03:54,537
Cheers.

54
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,382
It is especially gratifying to be
surrounded by such good friends...

55
00:03:59,554 --> 00:04:00,680
...and family...

56
00:04:01,056 --> 00:04:05,186
...and of course,
our two beautiful daughters...

57
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,657
...Sadie...

58
00:04:06,828 --> 00:04:08,420
...and Lindsey...

59
00:04:08,597 --> 00:04:10,690
...who has moved back home with us...

60
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:14,394
...to try and make a new start for herself.

61
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:15,729
We are...

62
00:04:16,638 --> 00:04:19,664
...so thrilled with her perseverance.

63
00:04:20,876 --> 00:04:22,844
Thank you for the support, Dad.

64
00:04:25,314 --> 00:04:29,216
And then there's Carlisle, Sadie's best
friend, who used to take baths with Sadie...

65
00:04:29,384 --> 00:04:30,851
- What?
- What?

66
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:36,013
...when they were younger,
and pretend he was a submarine captain.

67
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:38,682
I destroyed all the photos.
I promise you.

68
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,852
- Thank you. Very good to know. Thanks.
- Wait, what?

69
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,089
And our good friends, Don and Gwen...

70
00:04:44,266 --> 00:04:46,131
...Kwan-Li...

71
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:47,791
...Jerry, Otis.

72
00:04:48,136 --> 00:04:49,728
Dad...

73
00:04:50,272 --> 00:04:51,261
...what about...

74
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,271
- What about Ben?
- Oh, no, no, no.

75
00:04:54,242 --> 00:04:58,440
Oh, and of course, there's
Sadie's affable boyfriend, Ben.

76
00:04:59,514 --> 00:05:01,038
But what I really want to do...

77
00:05:01,216 --> 00:05:03,616
...is thank my beautiful wife...

78
00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:09,054
...without whom this life
would mean nothing.

79
00:05:09,257 --> 00:05:11,851
Happy 30th anniversary.

80
00:05:14,396 --> 00:05:15,988
- I love you.
- I love you too.

81
00:05:16,164 --> 00:05:18,223
And I hope there are 30 more.

82
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,800
Well, that makes one of us.

83
00:05:29,544 --> 00:05:31,978
Excuse me.
Could I have everyone's attention, please?

84
00:05:33,715 --> 00:05:35,239
I just wanted to...

85
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,386
Well, I thought since
everyone was gathered...

86
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:46,618
...gathered already...

87
00:05:49,765 --> 00:05:51,130
Oh, my God.

88
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:53,556
Oh, my God.

89
00:05:53,735 --> 00:05:55,669
- Sadie...
- Oh, my God, oh, my God.

90
00:05:55,837 --> 00:05:57,464
...Wilhelmina Jones.

91
00:05:59,274 --> 00:06:04,177
In front of God and your family...

92
00:06:04,513 --> 00:06:10,281
...Kwan-Li, and Jerry and Otis and...

93
00:06:12,354 --> 00:06:14,549
I just want to know...

94
00:06:14,723 --> 00:06:17,692
...if you would spend the rest
of your life with me.

95
00:06:20,195 --> 00:06:21,253
But I don't...

96
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,625
I don't want to put you
on the spot or anything.

97
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:28,759
Benjamin Murphy, I would marry you
tomorrow in a potato-sack dress...

98
00:06:28,937 --> 00:06:33,340
...in the middle of a rainstorm, if it meant
I could spend the rest of my life with you.

99
00:06:38,914 --> 00:06:40,142
Wait a second.

100
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:47,418
You choose our 30th wedding anniversary
to propose to my daughter?

101
00:06:50,192 --> 00:06:51,659
Well...

102
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,060
...we couldn't be happier.

103
00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:56,356
Oh, my gosh.

104
00:06:56,531 --> 00:06:57,725
I know.

105
00:06:59,568 --> 00:07:01,536
New brother-in-law-to-be, I guess.

106
00:07:01,703 --> 00:07:03,830
- Oh, man. Hey, hello.
- Awkward.

107
00:07:04,005 --> 00:07:05,870
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

108
00:07:07,776 --> 00:07:09,903
- Welcome to the family, Ben.
- Sir. All right!

109
00:07:10,078 --> 00:07:12,569
- Oh, my baby.
- Oh, honey, I'm so happy for you.

110
00:07:12,747 --> 00:07:14,806
Look at this beautiful ring.

111
00:07:14,983 --> 00:07:17,042
Sadie, Sadie, I was thinking...

112
00:07:17,452 --> 00:07:21,081
I think we should have the wedding
somewhere tropical. I was thinking, like...

113
00:07:21,256 --> 00:07:22,723
...the Caribbean.

114
00:07:22,891 --> 00:07:24,620
I have this one thing.

115
00:07:26,761 --> 00:07:28,251
Okay.

116
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,057
I always wanted
to get married here.

117
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:34,299
Here.
What do you mean?

118
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:35,697
At Saint Augustine's.

119
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:39,363
It's this fantasy I've had
since I was a little girl.

120
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,406
It's the church where
John and I married.

121
00:07:41,576 --> 00:07:44,841
Where Sadie was christened by
Reverend Frank, who's known us forever.

122
00:07:45,013 --> 00:07:48,210
More importantly, it's the church
Sadie's grandfather built.

123
00:07:49,484 --> 00:07:50,610
Her dead grandfather.

124
00:07:50,785 --> 00:07:54,721
Oh, give me a break.
All he built was a door after it was stolen.

125
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,983
How would you know?
You weren't married there.

126
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:59,286
And we all know
how that marriage turned out.

127
00:07:59,461 --> 00:08:00,928
Mom!

128
00:08:01,096 --> 00:08:03,724
- Stop.
- Here, here, here, here.

129
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:06,265
Babe, you've made me so
unbelievably happy today.

130
00:08:06,434 --> 00:08:07,423
You have no idea.

131
00:08:07,636 --> 00:08:09,001
- Great.
- Yeah.

132
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:11,765
Then Saint Augustine's...

133
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,909
...is the decision.
- Thank you, I love you.

134
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,235
- You ready?
- I'm missing a shoe.

135
00:08:17,412 --> 00:08:19,972
- Well, where did you last see it?
- I don't know.

136
00:08:20,148 --> 00:08:22,639
You know, Ben,
your sweater's actually inside out?

137
00:08:22,817 --> 00:08:24,808
Gotta fix that.

138
00:08:24,986 --> 00:08:26,317
What would you do without me?

139
00:08:26,488 --> 00:08:28,854
You want the short list or the long list?

140
00:08:29,024 --> 00:08:30,889
Oh, and your belt?

141
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:33,118
- It's a little funny.
- No, my belt's fine.

142
00:08:35,063 --> 00:08:36,087
Wait a minute.

143
00:08:36,264 --> 00:08:38,289
- We're gonna be really late.
- No, we're not.

144
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:39,694
Yeah, we are.

145
00:08:39,868 --> 00:08:41,893
And your point is?

146
00:08:50,545 --> 00:08:51,773
How do I look?

147
00:08:51,947 --> 00:08:54,575
- You look like you've just been...
- All right, never mind.

148
00:08:54,749 --> 00:08:56,580
We're so going to hell, you know that?

149
00:08:56,751 --> 00:09:00,517
- Hey, here's the door Grandpa built.
- Wow, he does really good work.

150
00:09:16,338 --> 00:09:18,169
Don't touch that!

151
00:09:18,506 --> 00:09:20,269
Jesus! You scared me.

152
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:23,200
Jesus didn't scare you, I did.

153
00:09:24,112 --> 00:09:27,548
- Hi, I'm Sadie...
- Sadie Jones. Yes, I know.

154
00:09:27,716 --> 00:09:29,513
You have a 10:30 with Reverend Frank.

155
00:09:29,718 --> 00:09:31,015
Yeah. Is he here?

156
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,547
Reverend Frank is everywhere.

157
00:09:33,722 --> 00:09:35,383
Follow me.

158
00:09:39,995 --> 00:09:41,724
"Dear ELLE magazine:

159
00:09:41,896 --> 00:09:44,387
I just found out that my husband
of three months...

160
00:09:44,566 --> 00:09:47,034

Half of me wants to kill him, the other
half wants to salvage my marriage.

What to do?"

Yikes.

What kind of sins are we
dealing with here, guys?

- Sarah.
- Thou shall not commit adultery?

166
00:09:58,613 --> 00:10:01,707
Adultery. Going out for milk
when you have jugs at home.

Show me adultery!

Not neat to cheat! Okay!

Now, a lot of people ask me:

.


170
00:10:09,658 --> 00:10:12,456
"What if I'm cheating with a woman
who's really, really ugly?

.


171
00:10:12,627 --> 00:10:13,958
Does that make it all right?"

.


172
00:10:14,129 --> 00:10:16,893
No, it does not make it all right.
It is still a sin.

Couple years ago I instituted
a marriage preparation course here.

The course is a prerequisite

...performed on these grounds.

At the end of the course,
if I feel you're unprepared...

249
00:13:56,851 --> 00:14:01,413
...or you stop the course before completion,
I have the right to call off the wedding.

I'm sorry, but this isn't mandatory, right?
Because we're so ready to get married.

In other words, you have no choice.

Oh, yeah.

281
00:15:24,606 --> 00:15:26,267
Tomorrow morning,
bright and early.

282
00:15:26,441 --> 00:15:27,430
Be there.

283
00:15:27,609 --> 00:15:29,338
We all remember the 11 th Commandment.

284
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,738
I don't.

285
00:15:31,646 --> 00:15:33,341
Thou shall not be late.

286
00:15:36,884 --> 00:15:39,182
We've got a hundred things
to start, but it's doable.

287
00:15:39,354 --> 00:15:41,447
I just have to get Carlisle on the phone.

288
00:15:41,623 --> 00:15:45,457
- He was kidding about the no-sex thing?
- Carlisle? It's me. Get ready for this.

289
00:15:45,627 --> 00:15:48,187
- We will talk about the no-sex thing later.
- Okay, Ben.

290
00:15:48,363 --> 00:15:50,092
No sex?

291
00:15:50,264 --> 00:15:53,165
That's supposed to happen
after you get married.

292
00:15:53,534 --> 00:15:54,558
Joel, I come here...

293
00:15:54,736 --> 00:15:57,068
...for your compassion.
- I'm just giving you shit.

294
00:15:57,238 --> 00:15:59,729
Congratulations.
You are going to love marriage.

295
00:15:59,907 --> 00:16:01,807
Damn it, Joel.
What is wrong with you?

296
00:16:01,976 --> 00:16:04,103
You were supposed to be
watching them.

297
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:05,905
Shelly, baby, I'm on the roof.

298
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,742
Remember we said you won't
bother me when I'm on the roof?

299
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:11,009
- You're always on the roof.
- Exactly.

300
00:16:11,185 --> 00:16:12,982
- I heard that.
- Yeah.

301
00:16:13,154 --> 00:16:15,019
Where did this mud hole
even come from?

302
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:17,885
Oh, my God,
I am so getting my tubes tied.

303
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:22,223
This reverend says he wants me to meet
him after church tomorrow one-on-one.

304
00:16:22,997 --> 00:16:24,589
What is that?

305
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:26,757
You ever done that?
The marriage prep stuff?

306
00:16:26,934 --> 00:16:29,994
To tell you the truth, I don't remember
anything before D-day, man.

307
00:16:30,638 --> 00:16:32,196
It's like a black hole.

308
00:16:32,373 --> 00:16:34,807
All I know is that's my wife...

309
00:16:34,976 --> 00:16:36,637
...apparently those are my kids...

310
00:16:36,811 --> 00:16:39,609
...and this, this is my beer.

311
00:16:39,781 --> 00:16:42,511
Everything else is pretty much a blur.

312
00:16:43,117 --> 00:16:44,209
Yeah.

313
00:16:45,086 --> 00:16:46,348
Thank you.

314
00:16:46,521 --> 00:16:48,011
That's why you're my best man.

315
00:16:49,123 --> 00:16:50,920
Two words for your bachelor party:

316
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:52,650
Strippers and Sizzler.

317
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:56,095
I like to call it "beef and booty."

318
00:16:56,264 --> 00:16:58,357
I heard that.

319
00:17:00,601 --> 00:17:01,590
Oh, boy.

320
00:17:07,341 --> 00:17:09,571
Please, God, let somebody
be later than us.

321
00:17:09,744 --> 00:17:14,044
Hey. We'll just sneak in the back,
no one will notice.

322
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:16,007
We also ask...

323
00:17:16,184 --> 00:17:20,211
...that you watch over the Mansbridge
meat packers and their labor dispute.

324
00:17:20,388 --> 00:17:23,983
Grant our packers patience
as they await an amicable resolution...

325
00:17:24,392 --> 00:17:27,793
...with, Lord willing,
a four to six percent pay increase...

326
00:17:27,962 --> 00:17:29,793
...and dental would be nice.

327
00:17:34,836 --> 00:17:37,464
Look who decided to show.

328
00:17:39,807 --> 00:17:42,742
Choir! Let me hear it!

329
00:17:42,944 --> 00:17:46,607
You're late, you're late
You're late, you're late

330
00:17:46,781 --> 00:17:49,978
God's on time

331
00:17:50,151 --> 00:17:53,780
But you are very late

332
00:17:55,623 --> 00:17:58,717
It's your first offense.
We'll let it slide.

333
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,020
It happens again, I'm telling the Big Guy.

334
00:18:02,196 --> 00:18:05,097
And I'm not talking about
Larry Carmichael over there on drums.

335
00:18:06,501 --> 00:18:08,366
But seriously...

336
00:18:08,736 --> 00:18:11,204
...let us re-pray.

337
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,739
Sorry for bailing, Lord.
A brief interruption, but we're back.

338
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,810
We'd also like to pray for Walter...

339
00:18:17,979 --> 00:18:20,243
...recently returned from his
holiday in Thailand.

340
00:18:20,414 --> 00:18:22,075
Let's hope it's just a heat rash.

341
00:18:23,017 --> 00:18:25,247
- Vivian.
- I don't know how you do it, Frank.

342
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:27,546
Every week your sermons
get better and better.

343
00:18:27,722 --> 00:18:31,055
It comes from upstairs, Vivian.
I'm just the TiVo.

344
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:33,124
It wasn't that good.

345
00:18:33,294 --> 00:18:34,454
- You ready?
- Yeah.

346
00:18:35,763 --> 00:18:37,560
I have to go. I have stuff to do...

347
00:18:37,732 --> 00:18:40,098
...but you guys enjoy
your man-talk, okay?

348
00:18:40,268 --> 00:18:42,327
Don't say anything about me
behind my back.

349
00:18:42,503 --> 00:18:45,028
You'll never know so...

350
00:18:45,506 --> 00:18:46,666
Tight.

351
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:48,433
- Sorry?
- The car.

352
00:18:48,943 --> 00:18:51,207
- Hi.
- Bye.

353
00:18:52,213 --> 00:18:54,238
You ready? A little one-on-one?

354
00:18:54,415 --> 00:18:56,076
- Yeah.
- Come on. Let's go.

355
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,013
The name of our team is the Crusaders.

356
00:18:58,186 --> 00:19:02,350
I didn't want to tell the kids about the
Children's Crusades, it bums them out.

357
00:19:02,523 --> 00:19:04,548
Wow, you really meant one-on-one.

358
00:19:04,725 --> 00:19:06,317
Oh, yeah.

359
00:19:06,694 --> 00:19:08,025
- A little hoops?
- No.

360
00:19:08,196 --> 00:19:09,322
This ball needs Viagra.

361
00:19:10,765 --> 00:19:12,426
- Play catch?
- Sure, love catch.

362
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,830
It's my favorite sport.

363
00:19:15,002 --> 00:19:17,266
Pardon the glove.
We've had a few budget cutbacks.

364
00:19:17,438 --> 00:19:19,099
- Oh, that's all right.
- Back up.

365
00:19:19,674 --> 00:19:20,902
Okay.

366
00:19:21,075 --> 00:19:23,600
What are you, a little girl's softball league?
Back up.

367
00:19:23,778 --> 00:19:25,177
Okay. Not a little girl.

368
00:19:25,346 --> 00:19:26,677
- Yeah.
- All right.

369
00:19:26,848 --> 00:19:28,713
It's nice to be able to chat with you...

370
00:19:28,883 --> 00:19:32,114
...without all this "I'm a pastor
who can send you to hell" nonsense.

371
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,714
No, me too. This is great.

372
00:19:33,888 --> 00:19:36,152
Little one-on-one time
with your spiritual elder.

373
00:19:37,091 --> 00:19:39,025
Bless you, Benjamin.

374
00:19:40,161 --> 00:19:42,629
- Too hard?
- No. That's a...

375
00:19:42,797 --> 00:19:44,492
That's a good burn. Right?

376
00:19:44,665 --> 00:19:47,395
Anything that's painful
makes you stronger.

377
00:19:47,568 --> 00:19:50,435
Not really. You break your leg,
your leg doesn't get stronger.

378
00:19:50,605 --> 00:19:52,800
God is just, but God is kind.

379
00:19:54,842 --> 00:19:56,867
That's a nice sentiment.

380
00:19:57,645 --> 00:19:59,340
Thank you.
Can I ask you something?

381
00:19:59,513 --> 00:20:01,003
- Sure.
- Sadie.

382
00:20:01,182 --> 00:20:02,774
Why do you love her?

383
00:20:04,085 --> 00:20:05,916
There's just so many reasons, you know?

384
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:08,555
She's beautiful, inside and out.

385
00:20:08,723 --> 00:20:10,418
So, I'm lucky.

386
00:20:10,591 --> 00:20:12,650
What do you mean by "inside"?

387
00:20:13,828 --> 00:20:15,352
You meant spiritually, right?

388
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:17,224
Yep. Exactly.

389
00:20:17,398 --> 00:20:19,423
Okay. What else?

390
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:25,035
She's just smart, you know?
She's motivated, she's well-organized.

391
00:20:25,206 --> 00:20:27,106
She's probably
the hardest worker I know.

392
00:20:28,175 --> 00:20:31,042
Well, let me get this straight, then.
Correct me if I'm wrong.

393
00:20:31,212 --> 00:20:34,340
First thing you like about her is her looks.
But you really think...

394
00:20:34,515 --> 00:20:36,881
...she's a cute control freak.
- I didn't say that.

395
00:20:37,051 --> 00:20:41,647
- I know what you're getting at.
- "Organized" is code for OCD.

396
00:20:41,822 --> 00:20:43,380
OCD is a...

397
00:20:43,557 --> 00:20:44,649
God!

398
00:20:46,661 --> 00:20:48,788
Oh, my Lord.

399
00:20:49,397 --> 00:20:50,762
- You okay, big fella?
- Yeah.

400
00:20:50,932 --> 00:20:52,092
Oh, yeah?

401
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:53,733
- How you doing...
- Totally fine.

402
00:20:53,901 --> 00:20:56,392
Let's see that. Come on.
Oh, no. That's bad.

403
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:57,867
I'm gonna have to heal you.

404
00:20:58,439 --> 00:21:00,703
- No, that's okay.
- No. I'm gonna have to heal you.

405
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,241
- I just need Advil.
- It's healing time. Stay down.

406
00:21:03,411 --> 00:21:05,345
Stay down. It's healing time.

407
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,509
- What's that mean?
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

408
00:21:07,682 --> 00:21:10,708
Oh, Lord, surround him
with your light and grace.

409
00:21:10,885 --> 00:21:12,409
Lord have mercy!

410
00:21:12,586 --> 00:21:14,918
- The power of Christ compels you!
- Lord have mercy.

411
00:21:15,089 --> 00:21:16,716
The power of Christ compels you!

412
00:21:16,891 --> 00:21:19,223
- We have got to pray!
- Pray!

413
00:21:19,393 --> 00:21:20,951
- We have got to pray!
- Pray!

414
00:21:21,128 --> 00:21:23,255
We have got to pray to make it
through the day!

415
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:24,855
Is that MC Hammer?

416
00:21:25,266 --> 00:21:28,258
- You're healed, right?
- Let me see. Let me see.

417
00:21:28,436 --> 00:21:31,803
- No, it's still bleeding.
- Let's go old school.

418
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:36,339
Begone, demon spirit!

419
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,239
Begone!

420
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,472
- That's not helping at all.
- Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

421
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,277
Lord, take him up upon your wing...

422
00:21:44,452 --> 00:21:47,012
- Wait, take me where?
- Lf you believed, you'd be healed.

423
00:21:47,188 --> 00:21:48,587
- Do you believe?
- Believe!

424
00:21:48,756 --> 00:21:50,849
- Believe!
- I'm healed, I'm healed, I'm healed.

425
00:21:51,025 --> 00:21:53,789
- Oh, it's a miracle! It's a miracle!
- It is. It is.

426
00:21:53,961 --> 00:21:56,259
You're not healed.
I'm not a doctor, I'm a pastor.

427
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:59,263
You know what you need?
Advil and ice. Come on.

428
00:21:59,433 --> 00:22:03,369
- Check him out, just see that he's okay.
- The nasal septum and concha are clear.

429
00:22:03,537 --> 00:22:07,029
- Good news, kid. Your nose is fine.
- Yeah, come on. Let me buy you a Coke.

430
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,642
Sorry about that.
You know, I have to try that stuff.

431
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,938
- Never works, but what if it had?
- Yeah.

432
00:22:13,114 --> 00:22:14,911
- Wouldn't that be crazy?
- Crazy.

433
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,209
It was great.

434
00:22:18,386 --> 00:22:20,980
Yes, totally.
Reverend Frank is the best.

435
00:22:21,155 --> 00:22:24,181
Listen, tomorrow night, I was th...

436
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:27,819
Group counseling for what?

437
00:22:33,334 --> 00:22:34,699
Okay, like we do every week.

438
00:22:34,869 --> 00:22:37,531
Danny, pick up Tenika
and carry her across that threshold.

439
00:22:37,705 --> 00:22:39,002
Yeah, that's it!

440
00:22:39,173 --> 00:22:41,505
Try and think of it like the first time.

441
00:22:41,675 --> 00:22:43,802
For a lot of you,
that wasn't the honeymoon.

442
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:47,679
Yeah, baby. Come on, Jim.

443
00:22:47,848 --> 00:22:49,008
My back is giving out.

444
00:22:49,183 --> 00:22:50,377
Don't focus on the pain.

445
00:22:50,551 --> 00:22:53,679
Look at the love that
Janine's giving you right now.

446
00:22:53,854 --> 00:22:56,448
And if that doesn't work,
think about potato skins.

447
00:22:56,991 --> 00:22:58,982
God, I love potato skins.

448
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,287
A husband will do anything
for appetizers.

449
00:23:01,462 --> 00:23:02,520
Yes.

450
00:23:04,231 --> 00:23:06,859
Everybody, I want to introduce you
to two new members.

451
00:23:07,034 --> 00:23:09,901
This is Ben and Sadie.
They're getting married in three weeks.

452
00:23:10,071 --> 00:23:12,505
Ben, why don't you carry Sadie
across the threshold?

453
00:23:13,074 --> 00:23:14,598
Come on.

454
00:23:14,975 --> 00:23:17,842
Come on. Yeah, come on.

455
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:20,840
Yeah, there you go.
Get across that threshold!

456
00:23:27,354 --> 00:23:29,049
Hurry.

457
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:33,326
- Oh, great.
- Look.

458
00:23:56,383 --> 00:23:58,112
Got it.

459
00:24:02,156 --> 00:24:03,316
Tonight...

460
00:24:03,491 --> 00:24:06,085
...we learn how to fight fairly.

461
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,749
Sorry.

462
00:24:07,928 --> 00:24:10,260
What if we've never had a fight before?

463
00:24:11,198 --> 00:24:13,666
- Seriously think I'm gonna puke.
- Louise, no puking.

464
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:16,496
They're young.
They're allowed to be enthusiastic.

465
00:24:17,004 --> 00:24:19,404
Never had a fight,
it's about time you had one.

466
00:24:19,573 --> 00:24:21,973
So please, step up
to the top of the circle.

467
00:24:22,143 --> 00:24:24,008
Come on, get your butts up there!

468
00:24:24,178 --> 00:24:26,942
Let's get this perfect relationship
on its feet.

469
00:24:27,114 --> 00:24:29,378
Put it to the test. Okay.

470
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,245
I want you to imagine.

471
00:24:31,418 --> 00:24:33,818
You're driving in the mountains.
It's nighttime.

472
00:24:33,988 --> 00:24:35,853
But there's a torrential downpour.

473
00:24:36,023 --> 00:24:37,752
That thing with the wipers like this:

474
00:24:38,425 --> 00:24:40,393
You're tired. You're lost.

475
00:24:40,794 --> 00:24:42,159
You're getting cranky.

476
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:44,461
What was that?

477
00:24:44,632 --> 00:24:46,964
You got a flat tire
because you just hit a pothole.

478
00:24:47,334 --> 00:24:49,529
Instant argument potential.

479
00:24:49,703 --> 00:24:51,432
What do you do? How do you handle it?

480
00:24:52,072 --> 00:24:54,006
I think we'd probably just call AAA.

481
00:24:55,242 --> 00:24:58,678
Out of cell phone range.
Can't use the cell phone. Can't call AAA.

482
00:24:58,846 --> 00:25:02,043
You gotta handle it the old-fashioned way.
You gotta change the tire.

483
00:25:02,216 --> 00:25:05,083
You're pissed at each other. Go.

484
00:25:07,922 --> 00:25:11,119
Sorry I didn't see that pothole.

485
00:25:11,592 --> 00:25:13,116
It's okay, honey.

486
00:25:13,294 --> 00:25:16,263
Accidents happen,
so just be more careful next time.

487
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:18,489
- Promise I will.
- Cut!

488
00:25:18,666 --> 00:25:21,726
You guys travel medicated?
That was like "Prozac Takes a Vacation."

489
00:25:21,902 --> 00:25:23,597
That's not what we're looking for.

490
00:25:23,771 --> 00:25:27,867
Janine, why don't you and Jimbo show
them how this argument should play out?

491
00:25:28,042 --> 00:25:29,532
Sure.

492
00:25:33,981 --> 00:25:35,448
Hey, jackass!

493
00:25:35,616 --> 00:25:38,881
I told you to take Route 45,
but again, you didn't listen!

494
00:25:39,053 --> 00:25:43,319
Now it's pissing down outside
and we're stuck God only knows where.

495
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:46,391
Yeah, well, if we hadn't
left three hours late...

496
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,519
...because someone was talking
to her ball-busting mother on the phone...

497
00:25:51,065 --> 00:25:53,659
...well, then, maybe we wouldn't
be in this position!

498
00:25:53,834 --> 00:25:56,359
You are a sad, sad man.

499
00:25:56,537 --> 00:25:59,665
You will not emasculate me anymore.

500
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,001
- Go to hell!
- No, you go to hell, Janine.

501
00:26:02,176 --> 00:26:05,407
- Go to hell.
- Okay. Cut.

502
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,048
Everybody, Jim and Janine.

503
00:26:10,351 --> 00:26:12,683
We're gonna try something
a little different now.

504
00:26:12,853 --> 00:26:15,413
We're gonna do role reversal.

505
00:26:16,023 --> 00:26:17,354
All right.

506
00:26:17,524 --> 00:26:19,355
Sadie, I want you to be Ben.

507
00:26:19,526 --> 00:26:22,120
Ben, I want you to be Sadie.
Come on. Step up there.

508
00:26:22,296 --> 00:26:23,957
Come on, get up! Yeah!

509
00:26:24,131 --> 00:26:26,395
- Oh, gosh.
- Come on.

510
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:28,034
You're gonna change the tire.

511
00:26:28,202 --> 00:26:29,999
Ben, tire's down here.

512
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,434
You're down in that muck.
Here's your lug wrench.

513
00:26:32,606 --> 00:26:34,767
The lugs are right here.
But they're tight.

514
00:26:34,942 --> 00:26:38,844
They're rusty, they're old, all right?
You can't get them off and you're angry...

515
00:26:39,013 --> 00:26:42,744
...and you're cold, and you really...
You wanna tear each other apart.

516
00:26:42,916 --> 00:26:44,406
Go.

517
00:26:46,353 --> 00:26:48,321
Don't you wish
we were in cell-phone range?

518
00:26:48,489 --> 00:26:51,117
Then we could just call
AAA like we always do.

519
00:26:51,292 --> 00:26:54,784
- Yeah, I don't know how we got so lost.
- I don't either.

520
00:26:54,962 --> 00:26:57,021
Ben, maybe we wouldn't
have gotten lost...

521
00:26:57,197 --> 00:27:01,361
...if you had just followed the TripTik
that I prepared three days in advance.

522
00:27:01,535 --> 00:27:04,834
Well, I thought that I was following
the road signs pretty well.

523
00:27:05,005 --> 00:27:08,099
Just going with the flow, as usual.

524
00:27:09,677 --> 00:27:11,542
What was that?
What was that last thing?

525
00:27:11,712 --> 00:27:14,875
I'm just going along for the ride.

526
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:17,745
Who was? You. As me.

527
00:27:19,353 --> 00:27:21,685
Well, I'm not really sure
how anything gets done...

528
00:27:21,855 --> 00:27:26,918
...if people aren't following my
very specific instructions, Ben.

529
00:27:27,227 --> 00:27:29,718
But I love it when you're in charge.

530
00:27:29,897 --> 00:27:33,298
That way I don't have to
take too much responsibility, Sadie.

531
00:27:33,467 --> 00:27:37,335
Ben, don't you know that that's the only
way things get done around here?

532
00:27:37,971 --> 00:27:40,030
That's how things get done around here?
Good.

533
00:27:40,207 --> 00:27:41,606
I had no idea.

534
00:27:41,775 --> 00:27:43,709
- Thank you.
- Want me to show you?

535
00:27:43,877 --> 00:27:47,108
- He said counter...
- I think I have it under control!

536
00:27:51,151 --> 00:27:52,743
Dear Jesus!

537
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,354
- Potato skins down!
- Jim, Jim...

538
00:27:57,591 --> 00:27:59,923
Come on, everybody!

539
00:28:00,127 --> 00:28:02,721
Five-second rule!

540
00:28:03,497 --> 00:28:04,828
Janine!

541
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:08,164
Okay.
We'll pick up next week...

542
00:28:08,335 --> 00:28:10,667
...with balancing
the joint checking account.

543
00:28:17,478 --> 00:28:20,447
So are you writing your vows later or?

544
00:28:20,614 --> 00:28:23,139
No, I finished earlier.

545
00:28:23,917 --> 00:28:26,545
Hey, what color white should we
go with for the napkins?

546
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,119
There's ivory...

547
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,653
...and timid.

548
00:28:30,691 --> 00:28:31,988
Ivory.

549
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:37,119
I don't know, I kind of feel like it might
clash with the pistachio in the centerpieces.

550
00:28:37,297 --> 00:28:42,132
All right, well, you know what?
I'll just ask Carlisle tomorrow.

551
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:45,705
Yeah, you know who else you could ask?
Reverend Frank.

552
00:28:45,873 --> 00:28:47,568
Because he loves giving his opinion.

553
00:28:47,741 --> 00:28:49,208
Why do you say it like that?

554
00:28:49,376 --> 00:28:51,003
I don't know. Maybe because...

555
00:28:51,178 --> 00:28:53,646
...he's just a little bit...
- Knowledgeable.

556
00:28:53,814 --> 00:28:56,749
- Yeah.
- "Intrusive." I was gonna go with intrusive.

557
00:28:58,352 --> 00:29:00,684
Ben, he's not intrusive, you know?
He's just...

558
00:29:00,854 --> 00:29:03,721
...observing our relationship right now.

559
00:29:04,057 --> 00:29:08,187
- Like a voyeur.
- Reverend Frank is not like a voyeur.

560
00:29:08,395 --> 00:29:10,863
- A little bit.
- No, he's not.

561
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:15,858
What was that? What are you doing?

562
00:29:16,036 --> 00:29:17,731
Do you want to walk the midget?

563
00:29:17,905 --> 00:29:19,031
Course I do, but...

564
00:29:19,206 --> 00:29:23,108
...I don't think we should, because it's
against the rules until after the wedding.

565
00:29:24,044 --> 00:29:25,875
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

566
00:29:26,246 --> 00:29:28,806
- You're actually following that rule?
- Yeah.

567
00:29:28,982 --> 00:29:32,383
Because I want to pass the course.
Don't you?

568
00:29:33,153 --> 00:29:35,713
- Yes, I want to pass the course.
- So?

569
00:29:35,889 --> 00:29:40,121
So, I also want to play Pickle Me, Tickle Me
with my really hot fiancee.

570
00:29:41,562 --> 00:29:43,052
Okay?

571
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,960
- Come on.
- What?

572
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:47,430
No one else is gonna know.

573
00:29:47,601 --> 00:29:50,968
I'll know, Ben. I will know.
So just...

574
00:29:51,138 --> 00:29:52,696
Just please...

575
00:29:52,873 --> 00:29:56,639
...let's stick to the program for now.
Okay? Thank you.

576
00:29:58,078 --> 00:30:00,308
Three weeks never killed anyone.

577
00:30:00,481 --> 00:30:02,346
Really?
Has that ever been documented?

578
00:30:02,516 --> 00:30:04,006
Good night.

579
00:30:08,755 --> 00:30:10,586
Good night, Ben.

580
00:30:18,966 --> 00:30:21,764
Okay, I'm a cigar vendor...

581
00:30:23,437 --> 00:30:25,268
- What?
- Go to bed.

582
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:27,100
Thank you.

583
00:30:30,377 --> 00:30:32,140
What if I'm not tired?

584
00:30:32,813 --> 00:30:34,474
Yes!

585
00:30:34,648 --> 00:30:35,740
All clear.

586
00:30:35,916 --> 00:30:38,680
- What'd I miss?
- None of your business.

587
00:30:38,852 --> 00:30:42,253
- But they're right on schedule.
- Their optimism is touching.

588
00:30:42,422 --> 00:30:44,982
They remind me of the Anderson couple
we had last month.

589
00:30:45,158 --> 00:30:47,217
Yeah. You know what time it is?

590
00:30:47,661 --> 00:30:49,026
Time to turn up the heat.

591
00:30:49,196 --> 00:30:51,596
It's time to build on the foundation
we've set up.

592
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,699
Remind me never to cross you.

593
00:31:04,444 --> 00:31:06,571
I mean, I'm really glad
we're doing the course.

594
00:31:06,747 --> 00:31:09,272
I just wish Ben would take it
more seriously, you know?

595
00:31:09,449 --> 00:31:11,417
What about these
in my bouquet, Lindsey?

596
00:31:11,585 --> 00:31:12,813
No.

597
00:31:12,986 --> 00:31:14,283
No?

598
00:31:14,454 --> 00:31:19,084
I just want to feel some enthusiasm
from him, or is that expecting too much?

599
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:22,092
Sadie, you have so much
to learn about men.

600
00:31:22,563 --> 00:31:24,258
Pink.

601
00:31:25,465 --> 00:31:28,161
Flowers by Sadie, Sadie speaking.

602
00:31:29,002 --> 00:31:30,526
Meet where?

603
00:31:30,704 --> 00:31:32,638
I didn't even want to take this course...

604
00:31:32,806 --> 00:31:35,331
...and now she's following it
to, like, the nth degree.

605
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:38,376
Where are the cheerleaders?
Shouldn't they be practicing too?

606
00:31:38,545 --> 00:31:41,844
Come on, Famaletti! Deny that baseline!

607
00:31:42,015 --> 00:31:44,643
Coach Murphy, you were right
to put him on B-squad.

608
00:31:44,818 --> 00:31:47,548
- Get ready, Zach.
- Or maybe I'm just overreacting.

609
00:31:47,721 --> 00:31:50,781
I mean, give and take, that's a part of
every healthy relationship.

610
00:31:51,124 --> 00:31:52,250
Give and what?

611
00:31:52,426 --> 00:31:54,087
- Give and take.
- Man, listen to me.

612
00:31:54,561 --> 00:31:58,122
Once a woman senses she has control,
she'll tell a thousand of her friends.

613
00:31:58,298 --> 00:32:02,291
Then they'll want control too.
"I want a little piece of this control stuff."

614
00:32:02,469 --> 00:32:06,599
Next thing you know, they'll be running
companies and having their own offices.

615
00:32:06,773 --> 00:32:10,539
Do not set dangerous precedents
for other men.

616
00:32:13,113 --> 00:32:14,774
Hello?

617
00:32:15,449 --> 00:32:16,438
Late for what?

618
00:32:16,617 --> 00:32:20,849
Welcome to Saint Catherine's Maternity,
birthplace to over 4000 babies each year.

619
00:32:21,021 --> 00:32:24,115
That's almost 80 babies a week,
and we've never misplaced one.

620
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:25,280
Okay, maybe one.

621
00:32:26,026 --> 00:32:28,995
If you're shy, get your tubes tied now
and call it a day.

622
00:32:29,162 --> 00:32:31,756
A woman in labor basically
lies around almost naked...

623
00:32:31,932 --> 00:32:35,493
...while dozens of doctors and nurses
get a front row view of her wide open...

624
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:38,001
Virginia! Put some gloves
on those hands right now!

625
00:32:38,171 --> 00:32:39,729
We're not delivering pizzas here.

626
00:32:39,906 --> 00:32:43,467
Labor could last anywhere from
a few hours to a few days.

627
00:32:44,177 --> 00:32:48,580
And that's not even counting the nine
months of constipation leading up to it.

628
00:32:48,749 --> 00:32:50,444
Of course, there's always drugs...

629
00:32:50,617 --> 00:32:53,586
...so you should figure out how
you feel about that beforehand.

630
00:32:54,054 --> 00:32:55,419
L... Oh, God!

631
00:32:55,589 --> 00:32:58,217
And then be ready to toss
that decision out the window...

632
00:32:58,392 --> 00:33:01,327
...when the pain really kicks in.

633
00:33:02,229 --> 00:33:04,561
A woman in labor
wouldn't even feel that.

634
00:33:04,731 --> 00:33:06,289
Good to know.

635
00:33:06,466 --> 00:33:07,455
Or that.

636
00:33:07,634 --> 00:33:08,896
This way.

637
00:33:09,069 --> 00:33:11,003
You squeamish, Ben?

638
00:33:11,505 --> 00:33:12,938
Little bit, I guess.

639
00:33:13,106 --> 00:33:16,007
You have to figure out if you're
gonna be in the delivery room.

640
00:33:16,176 --> 00:33:17,700
Oh, yeah, of course he will be.

641
00:33:17,878 --> 00:33:18,867
Yes.

642
00:33:19,046 --> 00:33:21,310
Some men are so traumatized
by the experience...

643
00:33:21,481 --> 00:33:24,450
...they can never look at their wives
the same again.

644
00:33:24,618 --> 00:33:26,142
Sexually, that is.

645
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:28,981
Give me some slow, deep breaths.

646
00:33:29,156 --> 00:33:30,783
How many do you want to have?

647
00:33:30,957 --> 00:33:32,288
- Four?
- Two?

648
00:33:33,427 --> 00:33:35,861
Big push. Big push.

649
00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:38,190
I need an epidural!

650
00:33:38,532 --> 00:33:41,797
Look at her! She's breathing fine!

651
00:33:42,102 --> 00:33:43,296
What about me?

652
00:33:45,439 --> 00:33:47,964
They say for a man to experience
the equivalent pain...

653
00:33:48,141 --> 00:33:50,302
...you'd have to pull your scrotum
over your head.

654
00:33:51,478 --> 00:33:52,775
That was incredible.

655
00:33:52,946 --> 00:33:54,243
Glad you feel that way.

656
00:33:54,414 --> 00:33:56,905
Because now the real fun begins.

657
00:33:57,317 --> 00:33:59,046
Welcome to the world of parenting.

658
00:33:59,219 --> 00:34:02,382
- They breathe, they blink, they cry.
- And they're all yours.

659
00:34:02,856 --> 00:34:06,292
Congratulations, you've just had twins.

660
00:34:09,863 --> 00:34:12,161
Look at how their little chests
move up and down.

661
00:34:12,332 --> 00:34:15,699
Yeah. Their creepy little chests.

662
00:34:15,869 --> 00:34:18,667
And you really want four of these things?

663
00:34:19,206 --> 00:34:22,004
I think it'd be nice to have
a big family, don't you?

664
00:34:22,175 --> 00:34:24,439
Yeah. No, no, definitely.

665
00:34:24,611 --> 00:34:25,635
Well, I mean...

666
00:34:25,812 --> 00:34:28,474
...four might be kind of
a big commitment.

667
00:34:33,587 --> 00:34:36,420
Okay, do you want to take that?

668
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:40,590
No, you can do it. Come on.

669
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,495
Just pat him on the back really gently.

670
00:34:45,665 --> 00:34:46,927
Okay.

671
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,658
Poor little baby.

672
00:34:48,835 --> 00:34:52,032
Little creepy robot baby.

673
00:34:54,508 --> 00:34:56,100
Oh, my God!

674
00:34:58,378 --> 00:35:00,505
- God.
- Hold on.

675
00:35:01,348 --> 00:35:02,679
- Here you go.
- Stop, stop.

676
00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:04,714
Hold on, hold on. There you go.

677
00:35:04,885 --> 00:35:07,080
- There's some on his shirt too.
- Okay.

678
00:35:07,254 --> 00:35:09,415
We can't forget to set the alarm for 8...

679
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:12,422
...because we're going to Macy's
to register for the wedding.

680
00:35:12,592 --> 00:35:14,924
Wait, we're not bringing these
with us, are we?

681
00:35:15,095 --> 00:35:17,962
Come on, can't we just, like,
phone in our order or something?

682
00:35:18,131 --> 00:35:22,465
No, we're so jammed this week,
tomorrow's the only day we can do it.

683
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,070
Look at that. Fell back asleep.

684
00:35:29,876 --> 00:35:31,173
So I did it.

685
00:35:31,344 --> 00:35:34,006
Looks like this parenting thing
isn't as hard as they say.

686
00:35:34,181 --> 00:35:35,978
See? You're a natural.

687
00:35:36,149 --> 00:35:37,138
Thanks.

688
00:35:37,317 --> 00:35:38,306
Night.

689
00:35:43,056 --> 00:35:46,025
Ben? Ben!

690
00:35:46,193 --> 00:35:47,956
Ben!

691
00:35:48,328 --> 00:35:49,488
Ben!

692
00:35:49,663 --> 00:35:51,722
Okay, I'm coming.

693
00:35:51,898 --> 00:35:53,661
What? Hi.

694
00:35:53,834 --> 00:35:56,598
How many times do I have to knock, man?
How you doing?

695
00:35:56,803 --> 00:35:58,065
- Good.
- Good morning.

696
00:35:58,238 --> 00:36:00,035
- Shelly's dad fell off a ladder.
- What?

697
00:36:00,207 --> 00:36:02,869
And unfortunately, he's gonna make it.
So we have to go...

698
00:36:03,043 --> 00:36:05,307
...and you are on brat patrol
for a couple hours.

699
00:36:05,478 --> 00:36:07,446
Thank you. Appreciate it.
Thanks a million.

700
00:36:14,221 --> 00:36:16,246
Hi.

701
00:36:16,857 --> 00:36:18,916
Which one's the biter?

702
00:36:19,092 --> 00:36:22,960
All you have to do is point the gun at
the item you want and then pull the trigger.

703
00:36:23,129 --> 00:36:26,997
The computer instantly logs it in our registry
database for your guests to consider.

704
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:29,499
There's no limit to how many
items I can choose?

705
00:36:29,669 --> 00:36:31,694
- When in doubt, zap it.
- Great.

706
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,499
We only have a couple hours so...

707
00:36:33,673 --> 00:36:36,039
Chop-chop. Come on.

708
00:36:36,776 --> 00:36:39,768
Okay. All right. Yep.

709
00:36:39,946 --> 00:36:41,777
Guys, guys, guys,
slow down, slow down.

710
00:36:41,948 --> 00:36:43,848
Hey. All right, that's good.

711
00:36:44,017 --> 00:36:47,544
Now we're going faster.
Stop, stop. Hello?

712
00:36:47,721 --> 00:36:48,983
All right, guys. All right.

713
00:36:49,155 --> 00:36:52,682
The yelling needs to hold off. All right.

714
00:36:53,393 --> 00:36:56,021
Hey, Ben, what do you like better?
The blue or the beige?

715
00:36:56,196 --> 00:36:57,788
The beige or the blue?

716
00:36:57,964 --> 00:37:00,398
- I like the blue. Blue's good.
- Beige goes better...

717
00:37:00,567 --> 00:37:01,795
...with the placemats.

718
00:37:02,235 --> 00:37:03,998
Or beige. Let's just do beige.

719
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,637
I love beige.

720
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:07,866
Beige it is.

721
00:37:17,183 --> 00:37:18,946
- Do you like this one?
- It's great.

722
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,145
- All right, let's get this one.
- Yeah, let's get a couple.

723
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:26,986
Oh, I just got this text message
from Carlisle.

724
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,684
I got the wrong dinnerware.

725
00:37:28,862 --> 00:37:31,695
- Do you mean silverware? Can we just go?
- No, dinnerware.

726
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,764
- No way. That is not simulated.
- God, that's bad.

727
00:37:38,772 --> 00:37:40,706
Well, why don't you change the diaper...

728
00:37:40,874 --> 00:37:42,466
...and I'll go get the dinnerware?

729
00:37:42,642 --> 00:37:45,270
- Why don't we think about...
- Okay.

730
00:37:49,649 --> 00:37:50,673
Okay.

731
00:38:25,151 --> 00:38:26,709
Yeah.

732
00:38:29,689 --> 00:38:31,782
Stop! Oh, God!

733
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:34,119
Stop, stop!

734
00:38:35,295 --> 00:38:38,526
Should we get the 500-thread count?
Ben, can you slow down a little bit?

735
00:38:38,698 --> 00:38:40,791
Oh, I'm trying.

736
00:38:45,972 --> 00:38:47,371
Oh, my God.

737
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,564
Sorry. Ben?

738
00:38:48,742 --> 00:38:50,676
- Give me one, please?
- Will you take that?

739
00:38:50,844 --> 00:38:52,311
I'm gonna give you one.

740
00:38:52,479 --> 00:38:55,846
- I will help you by getting this one thing...
- I'm sorry.

741
00:38:56,016 --> 00:38:57,711
Guys, guys, guys, it's okay.

742
00:38:59,552 --> 00:39:01,179
- Come here. Come on, come on.
- Okay.

743
00:39:01,354 --> 00:39:03,652
Ben, don't drop him!

744
00:39:03,823 --> 00:39:05,654
Here, take the kids. Come on, come on.

745
00:39:05,825 --> 00:39:07,315
Boys, let's go. Come on.

746
00:39:07,494 --> 00:39:10,725
Hi, I'm looking for some Pima cotton
or Egyptian cotton sheets.

747
00:39:10,897 --> 00:39:13,297
Something that really seems to breathe.
I'm sorry.

748
00:39:13,466 --> 00:39:16,697
I can't seem to find them over there
and I have...

749
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:19,430
Get off the bed.
All right.

750
00:39:21,408 --> 00:39:22,875
Get off the bed.

751
00:39:23,043 --> 00:39:26,604
Enough. Okay, enough.
No, no. Okay. Stop!

752
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,476
No, no, no.
Guys, no, no, no.

753
00:39:29,649 --> 00:39:33,346
Just stop. Sorry.
It's fine. It's just a...

754
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,851
Stop.

755
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:40,016
Stop it! Stop, you stupid... Shut up!

756
00:39:40,193 --> 00:39:45,460
Just shut up, shut up, shut up!
Shut up, shut up! Shut it! Shut it!

757
00:39:45,632 --> 00:39:48,226
- Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
- I'm sorry.

758
00:39:48,601 --> 00:39:50,660
Thank God. I've had a long day.

759
00:39:50,837 --> 00:39:53,305
These are fake. Watch. See?

760
00:39:55,275 --> 00:39:56,765
No, no, no, we're on our way.

761
00:39:56,943 --> 00:40:01,141
We just got a little detained at Macy's.
Well, Ben did.

762
00:40:01,314 --> 00:40:03,544
For being a public nuisance.

763
00:40:03,716 --> 00:40:05,707
It's a long story.

764
00:40:05,885 --> 00:40:09,116
Okay. Bye.

765
00:40:10,156 --> 00:40:11,453
Well, I'll tell you...

766
00:40:11,624 --> 00:40:14,616
...l'm a lot more prepared for kids now.

767
00:40:15,095 --> 00:40:16,153
Like way more.

768
00:40:16,329 --> 00:40:19,958
Why are there 56 bras on here?

769
00:40:39,419 --> 00:40:41,819
Pour a glass of that for yourself.
Have a glass.

770
00:40:41,988 --> 00:40:45,651
All right, I got it. This is it.
You, my dear, look amazing.

771
00:40:47,527 --> 00:40:49,358
I can't believe all these cheeses.

772
00:40:49,529 --> 00:40:52,020
I know.
I don't even know which to start with.

773
00:40:52,198 --> 00:40:54,826
- There are so many.
- It's funny. Cheez Whiz or Velveeta.

774
00:40:55,001 --> 00:40:57,970
That's about as complicated
as my cheese dilemmas usually get.

775
00:40:58,138 --> 00:41:01,369
I think I prefer the nutty
Comte Saint-Antoine, which is this one.

776
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:03,805
- All right, this is it?
- From the Basque region...

777
00:41:03,977 --> 00:41:06,878
...and go.
Gonna change your life.

778
00:41:07,046 --> 00:41:10,948
- Oh, my God. Carlisle.
- Oh, my God. Carlisle. Wait a minute.

779
00:41:11,117 --> 00:41:14,609
Ben, Carlisle's totally right.
I mean, this nutty cheese is the way to go.

780
00:41:14,787 --> 00:41:16,652
It's so good. You have to try it.

781
00:41:16,823 --> 00:41:20,657
- The white one? Good.
- You were right. You recommended it too.

782
00:41:21,861 --> 00:41:23,954
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey!

783
00:41:24,697 --> 00:41:27,495
Every time I hear the word
"cheese us," I'm in.

784
00:41:27,667 --> 00:41:29,157
Praise Gouda.

785
00:41:31,004 --> 00:41:33,404
Look at all of you,
you're all dressed to the nines.

786
00:41:33,573 --> 00:41:35,598
Oh, Lindsey, you look fabulous.

787
00:41:35,775 --> 00:41:38,573
- Oh, thank you.
- How's life after the big D?

788
00:41:40,146 --> 00:41:41,374
That bad, huh?

789
00:41:41,648 --> 00:41:43,946
Men are a little too hard to train so...

790
00:41:44,117 --> 00:41:48,554
Thought I'd stop trying
and live vicariously through Ben's training.

791
00:41:50,523 --> 00:41:52,616
Here I was thinking I was
already housebroken.

792
00:41:52,792 --> 00:41:53,781
Maybe not.

793
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,188
- Cute.
- It's refreshing...

794
00:41:55,361 --> 00:41:57,386
...how honest you are.
It doesn't happen...

795
00:41:57,564 --> 00:41:59,759
...that easily for a lot of in-laws.
- Really?

796
00:41:59,933 --> 00:42:03,027
Because I feel like we all
get along really well.

797
00:42:03,203 --> 00:42:05,865
You know what, Ben is a wonderful
addition to this family.

798
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:07,506
Wow, thank you.

799
00:42:07,674 --> 00:42:09,539
Whatever.
There's a little awkwardness...

800
00:42:09,709 --> 00:42:11,836
...but nothing more
than just new family stuff.

801
00:42:12,011 --> 00:42:14,639
You know a great way around
new family awkwardness?

802
00:42:14,814 --> 00:42:17,112
- Word association.
- Excuse me?

803
00:42:17,283 --> 00:42:19,410
It's fun, really. You go around the table...

804
00:42:19,586 --> 00:42:22,555
...and you pick one word that best
describes each in-law...

805
00:42:22,722 --> 00:42:24,815
...then they pick one word
that describes you.

806
00:42:24,991 --> 00:42:30,088
- A give and take, kind of an icebreaker...
- I think it sounds so fun. I love games.

807
00:42:30,263 --> 00:42:31,753
That's the spirit, Grandma.

808
00:42:31,931 --> 00:42:33,762
Ben, start with Grandma.

809
00:42:33,933 --> 00:42:37,562
One word to describe Grandma.

810
00:42:38,371 --> 00:42:41,602
That word would be...

811
00:42:41,774 --> 00:42:43,332
...wisdom.

812
00:42:43,509 --> 00:42:44,669
Excellent.

813
00:42:44,844 --> 00:42:46,709
Grandma. What about Ben?

814
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,477
Peculiar for his age.

815
00:42:49,649 --> 00:42:52,140
Let's just try and stick with one word.

816
00:42:52,385 --> 00:42:55,479
- I'd just say peculiar.
- Okay.

817
00:42:55,655 --> 00:42:57,987
We have a winner.
Game over. I think.

818
00:42:58,157 --> 00:43:01,217
- No, no, come on. What about Lindsey?
- I don't wanna do it.

819
00:43:01,394 --> 00:43:03,954
Don't think.
What's the first word comes to your mind?

820
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:05,791
Go for it.

821
00:43:07,033 --> 00:43:08,466
Blond.

822
00:43:08,635 --> 00:43:10,034
- Are you kidding me?
- Golden.

823
00:43:10,203 --> 00:43:13,798
No, gold. No, like you exude gold.
Not dumb, though.

824
00:43:13,973 --> 00:43:16,669
- I didn't say dumb.
- You didn't say dumb. You said blond.

825
00:43:16,843 --> 00:43:18,572
Okay. Blond Lindsey.

826
00:43:18,745 --> 00:43:21,680
Oh, my tur... Okay, awesome!
Yes, okay, so...

827
00:43:23,349 --> 00:43:25,078
Assertive.

828
00:43:25,551 --> 00:43:29,453
If you need someone to take the bull
by the horns, Ben's your guy.

829
00:43:30,723 --> 00:43:32,247
That's a good one.
Not that good.

830
00:43:32,425 --> 00:43:35,485
I mean, she's laughing a little
too hard for it, but good joke.

831
00:43:37,096 --> 00:43:39,360
This is terrific.
See how you're breaking the ice?

832
00:43:39,532 --> 00:43:42,092
There's something new happening now.
Take a shot at Dad.

833
00:43:42,268 --> 00:43:44,133
- There we go.
- Sadie's dad is...

834
00:43:44,304 --> 00:43:45,362
He's outgoing.

835
00:43:45,538 --> 00:43:48,666
- Outgoing, like saying "nice."
- That's very fitting.

836
00:43:48,841 --> 00:43:50,536
You're not shedding any light.

837
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:52,837
- Come on, you can do better than this.
- Yes.

838
00:43:53,012 --> 00:43:54,445
- Let it rip.
- No, no, no.

839
00:43:54,614 --> 00:43:57,242
- No, don't push me. I'm not gonna...
- He's asking, Ben.

840
00:43:57,417 --> 00:43:58,782
- Go, come on.
- All right.

841
00:44:00,486 --> 00:44:01,748
What about pompous?

842
00:44:01,921 --> 00:44:06,187
- I'm a little pompous.
- What's the Wizard of Oz thing? Pompous.

843
00:44:06,793 --> 00:44:08,090
No, I was just kidding.

844
00:44:08,261 --> 00:44:12,459
No. No, no, no.
It's all right. I asked for it.

845
00:44:12,632 --> 00:44:16,466
I just meant somebody likes
to hear the sound of their own voice.

846
00:44:16,836 --> 00:44:18,326
Now you're getting interesting.

847
00:44:18,504 --> 00:44:20,096
Pompous dad, back at Ben.

848
00:44:20,273 --> 00:44:22,241
- Here it is.
- Okay.

849
00:44:22,875 --> 00:44:25,241
- How about vanilla?
- Whoa, mom!

850
00:44:25,411 --> 00:44:26,901
Called you vanilla.

851
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,344
Could be bland, I'm not sure,
but it's your call.

852
00:44:29,515 --> 00:44:33,884
- Back at mom. Come on, Ben.
- Okay, "Stepford-y." Stepfordy.

853
00:44:34,053 --> 00:44:36,851
Stepfordy? Is that an adjective?

854
00:44:37,023 --> 00:44:38,718
Yeah, it just describes, you know:

855
00:44:38,891 --> 00:44:42,452
"Let's just sweep everything under the rug
with a pat on the back, a smile...

856
00:44:42,628 --> 00:44:45,620
...and don't forget the glass of champagne
to take the edge off."

857
00:44:45,798 --> 00:44:47,197
You're on a roll. Come on.

858
00:44:47,367 --> 00:44:50,063
Do we have any problems here?
If we did, we'd just...

859
00:44:50,236 --> 00:44:55,230
...throw some money at it because we
all know there's nothing money can't buy.

860
00:44:58,945 --> 00:45:01,106
Can't buy communication like this.

861
00:45:02,682 --> 00:45:06,118
Hey, Ben, I thought you were
really great with my family today.

862
00:45:06,285 --> 00:45:07,582
Are you making fun of me?

863
00:45:07,754 --> 00:45:09,847
No. No. Course not.

864
00:45:10,022 --> 00:45:11,182
It sounded like you were.

865
00:45:11,357 --> 00:45:13,484
I'm not making fun of you.
The fact that you...

866
00:45:13,659 --> 00:45:16,651
...lost your mind and embarrassed yourself
in front of everyone.

867
00:45:16,829 --> 00:45:19,730
No, that's not making fun of anyone.

868
00:45:22,568 --> 00:45:25,128
- Okay.
- What?

869
00:45:25,405 --> 00:45:27,873
- Time for a punishment. Come here.
- No.

870
00:45:31,444 --> 00:45:32,433
What are you doing?

871
00:45:32,612 --> 00:45:36,104
- What does it look like I'm doing?
- Something that's very against the rules.

872
00:45:36,282 --> 00:45:37,806
Mayday.

873
00:45:43,823 --> 00:45:45,814
Hi. Just in the neighborhood...

874
00:45:45,992 --> 00:45:48,358
...thought I'd drop by,
make a little house call.

875
00:45:48,528 --> 00:45:49,961
Yeah, of course you were.

876
00:45:50,129 --> 00:45:52,757
- Am I interrupting anything?
- No, no, no. Come on in.

877
00:45:52,932 --> 00:45:55,423
- Oh, thanks. Yay.
- Come on in.

878
00:45:55,601 --> 00:45:58,968
- Hi.
- I won't overstay my welcome.

879
00:45:59,505 --> 00:46:02,099
I just wanted to check
and see if everything was okay...

880
00:46:02,275 --> 00:46:06,041
...because after the tasting,
things were a little tense with the in-laws.

881
00:46:06,212 --> 00:46:08,043
Nope. No tension here.

882
00:46:08,881 --> 00:46:10,348
Can I be frank?

883
00:46:10,516 --> 00:46:12,040
Of course, I'm Frank.

884
00:46:12,218 --> 00:46:14,015
Pardon the pun...

885
00:46:14,187 --> 00:46:17,384
...but at this stage in the course,
I usually find out that...

886
00:46:17,557 --> 00:46:20,720
...a lot of couples resort to sex
as a quick fix for their problems.

887
00:46:20,893 --> 00:46:24,090
I just wanna make sure you're
strong enough to resist the temptation.

888
00:46:24,263 --> 00:46:27,027
- Yeah. We are.
- Yeah.

889
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,532
Does that make you uncomfortable, Ben?

890
00:46:29,902 --> 00:46:33,030
No, I'm not uncomfortable
talking about sex, no.

891
00:46:33,206 --> 00:46:35,504
Having you in my living room
talking about sex...

892
00:46:35,675 --> 00:46:38,769
...that makes me a little uncomfortable.
Yeah.

893
00:46:38,945 --> 00:46:41,106
The number one rule of a good sex life...

894
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,009
...is not being so serious.

895
00:46:43,182 --> 00:46:44,444
You know, because...

896
00:46:44,617 --> 00:46:46,812
...if the humor goes,
there goes the intimacy...

897
00:46:46,986 --> 00:46:49,853
...and then there goes the marriage,
then divorce, yada, yada.

898
00:46:50,256 --> 00:46:52,224
But there is a remedy.

899
00:46:52,391 --> 00:46:55,258
Knowing what your partner likes sexually.
How do you find out?

900
00:46:55,428 --> 00:46:58,226
Well, you ask. That's kind of wonderful.

901
00:46:58,397 --> 00:47:01,230
Hey, one little exercise,
then I'm Audi 5000, okay?

902
00:47:01,801 --> 00:47:02,825
Ben.

903
00:47:03,002 --> 00:47:05,334
Look at Sadie
and complete this sentence:

904
00:47:05,505 --> 00:47:07,632
"I like it when..."

905
00:47:11,777 --> 00:47:15,338
- This is ridiculous. I'm not doing it.
- It's not, Ben. Come on, I wanna know.

906
00:47:15,515 --> 00:47:17,779
I don't wanna talk about it.
I don't wanna do it.

907
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:19,417
I wanna know.

908
00:47:20,052 --> 00:47:21,781
Please.

909
00:47:23,623 --> 00:47:25,488
Sadie.

910
00:47:26,492 --> 00:47:30,019
I really like it when...

911
00:47:30,596 --> 00:47:32,860
...Reverend Frank doesn't
interrupt us before sex.

912
00:47:33,032 --> 00:47:34,761
I'm glad I got that off my chest.

913
00:47:34,934 --> 00:47:36,492
- Okay.
- That's okay.

914
00:47:36,669 --> 00:47:39,536
You're not comfortable with this,
let's show him how to do it.

915
00:47:39,705 --> 00:47:42,833
- Don't hold back.
- I like it when it's out of the ordinary...

916
00:47:43,009 --> 00:47:44,408
...personally.

917
00:47:44,577 --> 00:47:48,274
That's weird, because I always pictured you
as a kind of in-the-bedroom person.

918
00:47:48,447 --> 00:47:52,349
- No, not really. No.
- Hi! Whoa! Out of the ordinary?

919
00:47:52,518 --> 00:47:53,746
We're out of the ordinary.

920
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,549
Because I remember having sex
on this carpet and I got a rug burn.

921
00:47:57,723 --> 00:47:58,951
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

922
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:00,592
One time, though.
It was great...

923
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,819
...but it's more the exception
than the rule.

924
00:48:02,995 --> 00:48:05,623
- I'm talking about, like, real spontaneity.
- Like what?

925
00:48:05,798 --> 00:48:07,959
Like my parents' bathroom?

926
00:48:08,134 --> 00:48:10,398
Oh, yeah, and everyone's
downstairs having dinner.

927
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:12,970
- Exactly. Or on the beach.
- Under a towel.

928
00:48:13,139 --> 00:48:15,607
- At work.
- In the office supply room.

929
00:48:15,775 --> 00:48:19,506
Or maybe at your grandmother's house
while she's in the kitchen making tea.

930
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:21,442
Yes! I love it when you get creative.

931
00:48:21,647 --> 00:48:24,013
You have no idea.
I love it when you take control.

932
00:48:24,183 --> 00:48:25,548
What do you like about that?

933
00:48:25,718 --> 00:48:28,152
Okay! That's enough of that!

934
00:48:28,321 --> 00:48:30,289
Ben, come on. This is just an exercise.

935
00:48:30,456 --> 00:48:32,356
- We were talking through it. Yes!
- No. No.

936
00:48:32,525 --> 00:48:35,153
Sadie.
Pushups, that's an exercise.

937
00:48:35,895 --> 00:48:38,159
No. No, I see
Ben's point of view here.

938
00:48:38,331 --> 00:48:40,060
Maybe we're rushing things a bit.

939
00:48:40,232 --> 00:48:42,700
Maybe I should pencil in
the date two years from now.

940
00:48:42,902 --> 00:48:45,462
- Okay.
- Sorry to bother you. Good night.

941
00:48:45,638 --> 00:48:51,235
I'll let myself out. I know the way.
You have a good night. I'm going out now.

942
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:54,004
- What was that?
- Please.

943
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,169
Reverend Frank!

944
00:48:56,716 --> 00:48:58,343
So we back on schedule?

945
00:48:58,517 --> 00:49:00,951
He's a reverend.
What did you think was gonna happen?

946
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,021
Well, I can't believe you were
talking to him like that.

947
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:09,753
I can't believe the first man to actually ask
me what I like in bed was my minister.

948
00:49:27,278 --> 00:49:28,472
Son of a...

949
00:49:48,066 --> 00:49:53,003
Hey, get your butt out the way!
This ain't no damn pedestrian crossing!

950
00:49:53,171 --> 00:49:55,366
So you're telling me
he bugged your apartment?

951
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,508
Yes.
And who knows what he heard?

952
00:49:57,675 --> 00:50:00,542
I mean, this guy is sick,
and I can't wait to tell Sadie.

953
00:50:00,712 --> 00:50:03,078
- She's gonna freak out.
- You cannot tell Sadie.

954
00:50:03,248 --> 00:50:06,342
You think she's gonna believe her
reverend is bugging your bedroom?

955
00:50:06,517 --> 00:50:08,246
Of course she will. I have evidence.

956
00:50:08,419 --> 00:50:10,114
Does this bug have his name on it?

957
00:50:10,288 --> 00:50:12,085
No. But...

958
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:13,614
All right.

959
00:50:13,791 --> 00:50:16,055
We can talk about this later
if you need to focus.

960
00:50:16,227 --> 00:50:19,094
I'm good. This is about you.
Lady in the wheelchair, please!

961
00:50:19,831 --> 00:50:21,025
Listen.

962
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:23,531
The lines of communication
have to be shut down...

963
00:50:23,701 --> 00:50:27,137
...between you and your woman.
She trusts the reverend completely now.

964
00:50:27,305 --> 00:50:29,603
She trusts him so much
she's calling Shelly...

965
00:50:29,774 --> 00:50:33,107
...and telling her how we need
to take a course to help our marriage.

966
00:50:33,511 --> 00:50:35,843
So I'm supposed to take this lying down?

967
00:50:36,014 --> 00:50:39,108
No. Look, let me make this simple, okay?

968
00:50:39,317 --> 00:50:42,718
We have to punch a hole in Frank's
holier-than-thou armor.

969
00:50:42,887 --> 00:50:47,688
We have to find his deepest,
darkest secret and take him down.

970
00:50:48,593 --> 00:50:50,220
Roach coach.

971
00:50:51,262 --> 00:50:53,230
Roach coach!

972
00:51:20,858 --> 00:51:22,587
I'm not doing that. I'm not doing it.

973
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,251
Thrust, thrust.

974
00:51:27,231 --> 00:51:30,530
All right, I know you're gonna find
something you like with this group.

975
00:51:30,702 --> 00:51:33,068
See, this is just what I gravitate towards.

976
00:51:33,237 --> 00:51:36,695
- Really simple.
- And no diamond? I'm fine with that.

977
00:51:40,545 --> 00:51:41,739
Split up?

978
00:51:42,947 --> 00:51:44,676
Come apart.

979
00:52:43,941 --> 00:52:44,930
Excuse me.

980
00:52:45,109 --> 00:52:47,669
Hi. I'm just here to pick up my rings.

981
00:52:47,845 --> 00:52:50,609
- Last name's Murphy.
- Murphy.

982
00:52:51,749 --> 00:52:53,774
- Okay, there you go.
- Oh, great. Thank you.

983
00:52:53,951 --> 00:52:55,816
Let's take a look.

984
00:52:55,987 --> 00:52:57,249
Oh, wow.

985
00:52:57,422 --> 00:52:59,413
- They're really beauti...
- Thank you.

986
00:53:00,792 --> 00:53:03,818
I'm sorry, does that say "Never to fart"?

987
00:53:04,028 --> 00:53:06,155
That's what you wrote
on your inscription form.

988
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:08,264
I'm sorry, I wrote "Never to part."

989
00:53:08,433 --> 00:53:10,298
I don't know who would've
written "fart."

990
00:53:10,468 --> 00:53:13,164
- That's ridiculous.
- We get pretty strange requests here...

991
00:53:13,337 --> 00:53:17,774
...and we just engrave whatever is written,
and there you go.

992
00:53:17,942 --> 00:53:20,706
- Yep. "Never to part."
- "Never to fart."

993
00:53:22,246 --> 00:53:24,237
- No, that's a P.
- It's an F, sir.

994
00:53:24,415 --> 00:53:28,010
Nope, that's a P. Do you see how
that comes around in a P way?

995
00:53:28,419 --> 00:53:29,511
- Judith?
- Yes?

996
00:53:29,687 --> 00:53:32,212
Could you come over here
just for a tiny little second?

997
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:33,823
Thank you. Judith...

998
00:53:33,991 --> 00:53:36,289
- Sure.
- What is this letter there?

999
00:53:37,829 --> 00:53:39,854
- That is an F.
- No, that's a P.

1000
00:53:40,031 --> 00:53:41,999
It's a P.
It comes around like a P.

1001
00:53:42,166 --> 00:53:45,067
Well, actually, if you look,
there's clearly a gap in the curl.

1002
00:53:45,236 --> 00:53:47,568
There's no gap in the curl.
Judith? It connects.

1003
00:53:47,738 --> 00:53:49,137
That's a P. "Never to part."

1004
00:53:49,307 --> 00:53:52,174
- Mark, could you just come...
- I don't know that we need Mark.

1005
00:53:52,343 --> 00:53:54,208
...a little quick second here?

1006
00:53:54,378 --> 00:53:57,040
- And what is that?
- Oh, the novelty inscription, yes.

1007
00:53:57,215 --> 00:54:00,582
Mark, it's not a novelty inscription.
It's a romantic inscription.

1008
00:54:00,751 --> 00:54:02,548
Excuse me.
What is this letter?

1009
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:07,555
- It's an F. I do teach penmanship.
- I took his class. It's wonderful.

1010
00:54:08,059 --> 00:54:09,720
- It's pretty clearly an F.
- Yeah.

1011
00:54:09,894 --> 00:54:10,883
Excuse me, excuse me.

1012
00:54:11,062 --> 00:54:13,223
Hi. I'm really sorry
to bother you. Very nice.

1013
00:54:13,397 --> 00:54:18,096
Could I ask you to help us out with
a problem here, just a little problem?

1014
00:54:18,269 --> 00:54:20,328
Could we show the normal person?
Thank you.

1015
00:54:20,505 --> 00:54:25,807
What would you call the letter between
the fingers that I'm pointing at right there?

1016
00:54:26,077 --> 00:54:27,669
- What is that?
- An F?

1017
00:54:27,845 --> 00:54:30,279
- I'm sorry, sir? Louder, please?
- An F?

1018
00:54:30,448 --> 00:54:31,437
- F.
- Yes.

1019
00:54:31,616 --> 00:54:34,779
- That's right.
- Okay, excuse me. Hi. All right.

1020
00:54:34,952 --> 00:54:36,920
I'm getting married in two days.

1021
00:54:37,088 --> 00:54:39,886
Thank you.
I really need that to say "Never to part."

1022
00:54:40,057 --> 00:54:42,719
- That's very nice.
- "Never to part." That's so sweet.

1023
00:54:42,894 --> 00:54:44,054
And that's what I wrote.

1024
00:54:44,228 --> 00:54:47,356
I need it to say "Never to part,"
and I need it done immediately.

1025
00:54:47,532 --> 00:54:50,365
So how do we do that?
How do we get that done?

1026
00:54:50,535 --> 00:54:52,526
We could have it tomorrow.
In the morning.

1027
00:54:52,703 --> 00:54:54,603
Great.
And that's what we can do.

1028
00:54:54,772 --> 00:54:56,364
But there's a $250 rush fee.

1029
00:54:56,541 --> 00:54:59,942
So I'm spending $250 on something
I asked you to do in the first place?

1030
00:55:00,111 --> 00:55:01,669
And we can guarantee that.

1031
00:55:04,282 --> 00:55:06,580
This is ridiculous. There's nothing here.

1032
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:08,309
Oh, come on, man.

1033
00:55:08,486 --> 00:55:11,284
If that old lady from
Murder, She Wrote can do this...

1034
00:55:11,455 --> 00:55:13,980
...then we can find something.

1035
00:55:14,158 --> 00:55:17,321
- Are you talking about Angela L...
- Just keep looking.

1036
00:55:19,497 --> 00:55:20,486
What is that?

1037
00:55:20,665 --> 00:55:22,633
Frank Littleton. That's his address.

1038
00:55:24,202 --> 00:55:26,830
But who's Maria Gonzales?

1039
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:54,120
- Hello?
- Joel, it's Ben.

1040
00:55:54,298 --> 00:55:55,822
There's no one here by that name.

1041
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,491
Is there another name
you'd maybe like to try?

1042
00:55:58,669 --> 00:56:00,261
Eagle, it's Sapphire.

1043
00:56:00,438 --> 00:56:02,269
Copy that, Sapphire.
What's your 20?

1044
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,907
I'm at John the Baptist's house.

1045
00:56:04,375 --> 00:56:06,104
- What's he doing?
- He's showering.

1046
00:56:06,744 --> 00:56:08,769
Dude, you're watching
him take a shower?

1047
00:56:08,946 --> 00:56:10,174
No, I'm outside.

1048
00:56:10,681 --> 00:56:12,114
Then get your butt inside.

1049
00:56:12,283 --> 00:56:15,946
- What? Are you nuts? I'm gonna get caught.
- Listen, the rehearsal's tomorrow.

1050
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,179
You've only got today to blow the lid off.

1051
00:56:18,356 --> 00:56:19,550
It's your only chance.

1052
00:56:19,724 --> 00:56:23,125
Strike first, strike hard. No mercy.

1053
00:56:30,768 --> 00:56:32,030
What the hell am I doing?

1054
00:56:51,222 --> 00:56:52,587
Stop!

1055
00:57:24,121 --> 00:57:25,588
Maria Gonzales.

1056
00:57:31,762 --> 00:57:32,786
I got you, sucker M.C.

1057
00:57:39,403 --> 00:57:41,803
Hi.

1058
00:57:42,073 --> 00:57:44,405
Wow, look at you...

1059
00:57:44,575 --> 00:57:46,702
...priest dog.

1060
00:57:48,679 --> 00:57:50,704
Hi.

1061
00:57:50,881 --> 00:57:52,075
I'm gonna...

1062
00:57:52,249 --> 00:57:53,682
No. No, no!

1063
00:58:01,292 --> 00:58:03,192
That's so gross.

1064
00:58:11,235 --> 00:58:12,463
Nicodemus!

1065
00:58:12,636 --> 00:58:14,365
Nicodemus!

1066
00:58:14,739 --> 00:58:16,730
No, no, no, no!

1067
00:58:17,274 --> 00:58:18,332
Nicodemus.

1068
00:58:18,509 --> 00:58:20,500
Leave Mr. Socks alone.

1069
00:58:20,678 --> 00:58:23,340
Nicodemus! Bad Nicodemus!

1070
00:58:23,514 --> 00:58:26,415
These are my Cheesy Curls.
No, don't you run away.

1071
00:58:26,617 --> 00:58:29,950
Bad. These are mine.

1072
00:58:30,254 --> 00:58:33,087
This is good.
Things are really good.

1073
00:58:33,257 --> 00:58:37,387
And I'm not even concerned with the fact
that Ben hasn't written his vows yet.

1074
00:58:37,561 --> 00:58:40,121
- Really?
- No.

1075
00:58:40,297 --> 00:58:46,099
He's just drawn this little animated truck
going through a hoop of fire.

1076
00:58:46,804 --> 00:58:48,396
You know what?

1077
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:50,072
It's actually better.

1078
00:58:50,241 --> 00:58:52,300
Because he's waiting
until the last second...

1079
00:58:52,476 --> 00:58:56,913
...when his mind is completely clear
and he can just say what he really means.

1080
00:58:57,882 --> 00:59:00,373
- Okay, hold on.
- What do we think? What's the verdict?

1081
00:59:00,551 --> 00:59:02,678
Let's just take a second.

1082
00:59:02,853 --> 00:59:04,787
Honestly?

1083
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:08,950
Looks a little bit like the inside
of a down comforter.

1084
00:59:11,562 --> 00:59:13,052
What the hell's going on?

1085
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:14,561
But look, no, the rhinest...

1086
00:59:14,732 --> 00:59:17,758
- It's beautiful, honestly...
- No. I'm not talking about the dress.

1087
00:59:17,935 --> 00:59:20,665
I'm talking about Ben.
An animated truck?

1088
00:59:20,838 --> 00:59:23,830
You know, I wrote seven pages
on how much I love and adore him...

1089
00:59:24,008 --> 00:59:28,911
...and all he can muster up for me is some
stupid Tonka truck in a three-ring circus?

1090
00:59:29,079 --> 00:59:31,639
- That's it?
- Okay, you know what?

1091
00:59:32,316 --> 00:59:33,578
Lay it on me.

1092
00:59:33,751 --> 00:59:35,946
Oh, God.

1093
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:38,520
Please tell me everything's gonna be fine.

1094
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:41,151
What do you want me to say?

1095
00:59:41,826 --> 00:59:44,124
Sadie, my marriage failed.

1096
00:59:44,762 --> 00:59:48,425
I watch Titanic by myself, alone,
in my room, every night...

1097
00:59:48,599 --> 00:59:50,965
...stuffing my face
with Honey BBO Fritos.

1098
00:59:51,836 --> 00:59:55,101
Not the one to give you any tips or advice
about your relationship...

1099
00:59:55,272 --> 00:59:57,604
...no matter how desperate you are.

1100
00:59:57,775 --> 00:59:59,242
Sorry.

1101
00:59:59,977 --> 01:00:06,007
However, I do recall my ex
never wrote any vows at all.

1102
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:08,113
Really?

1103
01:00:09,019 --> 01:00:10,452
That's kind of promising.

1104
01:00:10,621 --> 01:00:11,610
Yeah.

1105
01:00:11,789 --> 01:00:13,916
It was probably because he was
too busy...

1106
01:00:14,091 --> 01:00:17,891
...sleeping with our dental hygienist,
which was great.

1107
01:00:18,729 --> 01:00:21,289
Hey, but your hygienist is a guy, right?

1108
01:00:21,465 --> 01:00:23,023
Yeah.

1109
01:00:24,034 --> 01:00:25,194
You're fine.

1110
01:00:39,283 --> 01:00:42,377
Is this a piece of work?
They don't make them like this any more.

1111
01:00:42,786 --> 01:00:44,276
When two people say "I do"...

1112
01:00:44,455 --> 01:00:47,322
...they're putting their lives
in each other's hands entirely.

1113
01:00:47,491 --> 01:00:49,959
Anything less than that
is doomed to failure.

1114
01:00:50,127 --> 01:00:52,254
Now, the last test you have to pass...

1115
01:00:52,429 --> 01:00:54,761
...before I certify you
ready for marriage...

1116
01:00:54,932 --> 01:00:57,059
...is the communication test.

1117
01:00:57,835 --> 01:00:59,462
Which is very important...

1118
01:00:59,637 --> 01:01:02,936
...given how poorly we've been doing
in that area lately.

1119
01:01:03,107 --> 01:01:04,199
Oh, me? Don't worry.

1120
01:01:04,375 --> 01:01:06,070
I plan on communicating very well...

1121
01:01:06,243 --> 01:01:09,474
Okay, Ben, can you please
just let him finish talking?

1122
01:01:09,647 --> 01:01:11,239
- Thank you.
- Yep.

1123
01:01:13,584 --> 01:01:15,916
- Sorry, reverend.
- It's okay.

1124
01:01:16,086 --> 01:01:19,681
To demonstrate how important
communication is in that area:

1125
01:01:21,458 --> 01:01:23,153
- What?
- Blindfold.

1126
01:01:24,228 --> 01:01:26,492
- What are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything.

1127
01:01:26,664 --> 01:01:29,155
You're gonna be Sadie's eyes
as she drives us.

1128
01:01:29,366 --> 01:01:32,824
- You're insane!
- Lf you wanna pass this course...

1129
01:01:33,003 --> 01:01:35,597
...and get married tomorrow,
you have to pass this test.

1130
01:01:35,773 --> 01:01:36,933
Your call.

1131
01:01:37,107 --> 01:01:41,271
- Yeah. Yeah. I can do this.
- You're actually gonna go through with this?

1132
01:01:41,979 --> 01:01:45,847
- What, Ben, you don't think I can do this?
- Okay. Maybe you don't understand...

1133
01:01:46,016 --> 01:01:47,142
...what's going on here.

1134
01:01:47,318 --> 01:01:49,582
Ben, there's two sets of controls.

1135
01:01:49,753 --> 01:01:51,778
I can take over at any time.

1136
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,281
What'll it be, Benjamin?

1137
01:01:55,459 --> 01:01:56,653
Yeah.

1138
01:01:57,461 --> 01:01:59,656
Well, I'm gonna need
a little help here, though.

1139
01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:01,388
First you need to put it in gear.

1140
01:02:01,565 --> 01:02:03,465
- Check.
- And then you're gonna ease out...

1141
01:02:03,634 --> 01:02:04,862
...onto the street.

1142
01:02:08,839 --> 01:02:11,000
Left. Left!

1143
01:02:11,175 --> 01:02:13,803
There you are. Right.
To the right!

1144
01:02:13,978 --> 01:02:16,208
Ben, did you see a clipboard back there?

1145
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:18,371
There it is. Least it's warm.

1146
01:02:18,549 --> 01:02:20,380
- What...?
- It's a communication exercise.

1147
01:02:20,551 --> 01:02:22,519
You will be graded.
Less than 80 percent...

1148
01:02:22,686 --> 01:02:24,517
...consider getting married in Vegas.

1149
01:02:24,688 --> 01:02:26,918
You know what?
Vegas sounds awesome right now.

1150
01:02:27,091 --> 01:02:29,525
Maybe you can get an
Elvis impersonator to officiate.

1151
01:02:29,693 --> 01:02:31,058
"Hey, my wife. Yeah."

1152
01:02:35,766 --> 01:02:38,894
- Ben, you wanna help your future bride?
- Yep, yep, yeah. I do, I do.

1153
01:02:39,069 --> 01:02:41,401
How about we take a right?
Head back to the church.

1154
01:02:41,572 --> 01:02:43,233
You might wanna brake.
Anytime.

1155
01:02:45,409 --> 01:02:47,707
Sorry. I'm sorry. I just, I got nervous.

1156
01:02:47,878 --> 01:02:50,608
That's very good.
Taking responsibility. Excellent, Sadie.

1157
01:02:50,781 --> 01:02:52,248
More enthusiasm
in the back, Ben.

1158
01:02:52,416 --> 01:02:55,749
Oh, my God, I'm having so much fun!
Aren't you? I might pee my pants.

1159
01:02:55,919 --> 01:02:57,910
Sarcasm, wicked stepsister
of communication.

1160
01:02:58,088 --> 01:02:59,680
- Point off.
- Now take a right. Now.

1161
01:02:59,857 --> 01:03:01,324
- A right? Now?
- Now!

1162
01:03:03,627 --> 01:03:04,651
It's a one-way street!

1163
01:03:04,828 --> 01:03:06,523
Okay, well, then should I pull over?

1164
01:03:06,697 --> 01:03:09,063
No, no. Just go straight.
They'll go around you.

1165
01:03:09,233 --> 01:03:12,498
Oh, my... Jesus. Okay, okay.

1166
01:03:12,703 --> 01:03:17,504
- In about 20 yards we're gonna turn.
- 20 yards means nothing to me. I can't see.

1167
01:03:17,675 --> 01:03:20,109
Here we go. Turning now!

1168
01:03:21,211 --> 01:03:24,578
There's a man.
That's an old man in a hat and a thing.

1169
01:03:24,748 --> 01:03:26,272
Look out!

1170
01:03:29,153 --> 01:03:31,815
- I'm blind, Ben!
- That's enough. We're ending this. Stop!

1171
01:03:31,989 --> 01:03:34,116
Is that what you do
when things get difficult?

1172
01:03:34,291 --> 01:03:35,758
You're just gonna quit?

1173
01:03:35,926 --> 01:03:37,359
I need to count on you, Ben.

1174
01:03:37,528 --> 01:03:40,929
Life will hand you stress
and the key to managing your anxiety...

1175
01:03:41,098 --> 01:03:44,431
...is not letting it contaminate your partner.
- Garbage truck!

1176
01:03:45,436 --> 01:03:46,596
- Where?
- Punch it!

1177
01:03:49,406 --> 01:03:50,771
Yeah!

1178
01:03:52,443 --> 01:03:54,843
I'm pretty sure I'm not learning
anything from this.

1179
01:03:55,012 --> 01:03:57,276
- Are we good? Are we good?
- There's Burt Fleeger!

1180
01:03:57,448 --> 01:03:58,938
Looking good, Hollywood!

1181
01:03:59,116 --> 01:04:03,052
- I feel like I'm not getting any guidance.
- You might wanna pick up speed a little.

1182
01:04:03,253 --> 01:04:06,620
- Wait, wait. Why would we do that?
- There's a parking space up there.

1183
01:04:06,790 --> 01:04:08,587
Gun it, Sadie.

1184
01:04:13,464 --> 01:04:15,329
- I never get this space!
- Oh, my God!

1185
01:04:15,499 --> 01:04:17,296
Perfect.

1186
01:04:19,169 --> 01:04:20,966
Hello, Jones family. How's it going?

1187
01:04:21,138 --> 01:04:22,662
Hello, reverend.

1188
01:04:23,107 --> 01:04:24,768
Daughter's a good little driver.

1189
01:04:28,145 --> 01:04:32,013
Well, you have the wedding processional.
You can go with Mendelssohn...

1190
01:04:32,182 --> 01:04:35,845
...or one couple actually had Captain and
Tennille here playing "Muskrat Love."

1191
01:04:36,019 --> 01:04:38,681
It's your call.
After you boogie down the aisle...

1192
01:04:38,856 --> 01:04:41,154
...l'll start by saying something nice.

1193
01:04:41,325 --> 01:04:44,351
Speaking of that, let's give a big
Saint Augustine welcome...

1194
01:04:44,528 --> 01:04:48,191
...to Ben Murphy's parents,
Ron and Mary Murphy.

1195
01:04:48,499 --> 01:04:49,966
Came all the way from Seattle.

1196
01:04:50,134 --> 01:04:54,264
Then I get into a brief message about
the joy and the sanctity of marriage...

1197
01:04:54,438 --> 01:04:57,202
...and that on your honeymoon,
try and act surprised.

1198
01:04:57,374 --> 01:04:59,137
It's an old joke, but sometimes works.

1199
01:04:59,309 --> 01:05:01,140
Then we got prayer, hymn, prayer, hymn.

1200
01:05:01,311 --> 01:05:04,109
And then we get into the vows.

1201
01:05:04,281 --> 01:05:07,114
In my course, the couple
writes their own vows.

1202
01:05:07,284 --> 01:05:09,115
And that in mind, may I have your vows?

1203
01:05:09,686 --> 01:05:11,711
Thank you.

1204
01:05:12,489 --> 01:05:14,286
Thank you.

1205
01:05:16,059 --> 01:05:17,356
- Ben?
- Yeah.

1206
01:05:17,528 --> 01:05:18,654
Got the vows?

1207
01:05:18,829 --> 01:05:20,729
Ben, where are your vows?

1208
01:05:21,098 --> 01:05:22,258
Oh, I have them. I just...

1209
01:05:22,432 --> 01:05:25,401
I haven't finished them, but I will
have them here tomorrow.

1210
01:05:26,503 --> 01:05:29,563
Okey-dokey.
Well, I guess that'll have to do for now.

1211
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:32,072
After the vows,
we have the lighting of the candle.

1212
01:05:32,242 --> 01:05:35,075
- It's true, by the way.
- Not now, Ben. I just wanna think.

1213
01:05:35,279 --> 01:05:36,405
Thinking's good.

1214
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:38,878
- Yes, I wanna think about everything.
- What about?

1215
01:05:39,049 --> 01:05:41,142
I'm guessing these aren't
part of the vows.

1216
01:05:41,318 --> 01:05:46,756
Okay, because I used to think that we were
so perfectly compatible for each other...

1217
01:05:46,924 --> 01:05:48,755
...and now...

1218
01:05:49,326 --> 01:05:50,486
- Look at us, Ben.
- What?

1219
01:05:50,661 --> 01:05:54,256
- Ben, you want two kids, and I want four.
- So what?

1220
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:57,628
You obviously think my family
is a bunch of rich, alcoholic snobs.

1221
01:05:57,801 --> 01:06:01,237
- You never take the lead on things, Ben!
- And I'm not good enough for you!

1222
01:06:01,438 --> 01:06:03,929
I'm not adventurous enough in bed, right?

1223
01:06:04,107 --> 01:06:06,632
And I'm not as handsome as Carlisle,
not as successful.

1224
01:06:06,810 --> 01:06:08,869
Carlisle has nothing to do with it.

1225
01:06:09,046 --> 01:06:11,537
- Carlisle has everything to do with it.
- How?

1226
01:06:11,715 --> 01:06:15,242
Because he is someone whose opinion
you trust way more than mine.

1227
01:06:15,419 --> 01:06:18,786
Oh, God. When have I
ever said that to you, Ben?

1228
01:06:18,956 --> 01:06:20,048
You just don't have to.

1229
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:22,053
"Carlisle, what crystal should we use?

1230
01:06:22,226 --> 01:06:25,559
What brand of cheese is good, Carlisle?"

1231
01:06:25,729 --> 01:06:28,562
God, I am so sick of you
choosing Carlisle's cheese.

1232
01:06:28,732 --> 01:06:33,499
- Carlisle's cheese. Explore that, Ben.
- Enough of the pop psychology, reverend.

1233
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:38,107
Because all you've done is everything
you can to make sure this doesn't work.

1234
01:06:38,275 --> 01:06:42,234
I've worked very hard to create lines
of communication between you and Sadie...

1235
01:06:42,412 --> 01:06:44,607
...to let you know what you're in for.

1236
01:06:44,781 --> 01:06:46,214
- You're onto it.
- Yeah, we are.

1237
01:06:46,383 --> 01:06:48,851
We are discovering
a whole shitload right now!

1238
01:06:49,019 --> 01:06:50,646
- Really?
- Yes, we are, Ben.

1239
01:06:50,854 --> 01:06:53,880
- Guys, seriously, space, please.
- Now's the time. Pop the info.

1240
01:06:54,057 --> 01:06:56,252
Okay. Okay. You know what?

1241
01:06:56,426 --> 01:06:58,894
I didn't wanna have to do this,
but I have no choice.

1242
01:06:59,062 --> 01:07:02,122
So aside from the fact that
Reverend Frank bugged our apartment...

1243
01:07:02,299 --> 01:07:03,357
Excuse me, what?

1244
01:07:03,533 --> 01:07:05,501
I've mounted an investigation.

1245
01:07:05,669 --> 01:07:08,263
One that I think you would be
interested to hear about.

1246
01:07:08,438 --> 01:07:12,067
So Frankie, should I tell them
or should you?

1247
01:07:13,443 --> 01:07:15,070
What do you want me to tell them?

1248
01:07:15,245 --> 01:07:18,180
What I want you to tell them
is what their good and decent...

1249
01:07:18,348 --> 01:07:22,682
...and ever-so-intuitive reverend
was doing when he married...

1250
01:07:22,853 --> 01:07:26,289
...and then subsequently divorced
one Maria Gonzales.

1251
01:07:27,424 --> 01:07:28,789
That's not true.

1252
01:07:28,959 --> 01:07:32,690
Reverend Frank has never been
married or divorced.

1253
01:07:33,530 --> 01:07:35,725
That's what I thought too,
Grandma Jones.

1254
01:07:35,899 --> 01:07:36,991
But...

1255
01:07:37,167 --> 01:07:38,156
...Reverend Frank?

1256
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:42,002
It's true.

1257
01:07:42,172 --> 01:07:43,161
What?

1258
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:44,398
Oh, it's very true.

1259
01:07:44,574 --> 01:07:47,509
How can we trust anything
he said to us now?

1260
01:07:47,678 --> 01:07:50,875
We have put our relationship
in the hands of a total hypocrite.

1261
01:07:52,849 --> 01:07:56,842
I didn't wanna have to talk about this
to protect certain parties...

1262
01:07:57,020 --> 01:07:59,989
...but enough time has passed
so the truth can finally be known.

1263
01:08:00,157 --> 01:08:01,419
Yes. Please do.

1264
01:08:01,591 --> 01:08:05,152
Several years ago, a young woman named
Maria Gonzales attended our church.

1265
01:08:05,929 --> 01:08:09,194
She was a refugee who was
denied political asylum.

1266
01:08:09,366 --> 01:08:13,962
If she was deported back to Guatemala,
she would have faced most certain death.

1267
01:08:14,137 --> 01:08:17,072
So in order for her and her children
to stay in this country...

1268
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:20,403
...I agreed to marry her
so she could get a green card.

1269
01:08:20,744 --> 01:08:23,679
Once she was legal, we divorced.

1270
01:08:23,847 --> 01:08:26,338
She moved to New Mexico with her kids.

1271
01:08:26,516 --> 01:08:29,576
A couple of years ago I got a letter
from her, and she told me...

1272
01:08:29,753 --> 01:08:33,211
...that her oldest
had been accepted to Harvard Law.

1273
01:08:33,690 --> 01:08:37,683
He was going to graduate
in the top of his class, and when he did...

1274
01:08:37,861 --> 01:08:40,091
...he was going to go
into immigration reform.

1275
01:08:40,263 --> 01:08:43,232
And that is the story of Maria Gonzales.

1276
01:08:44,701 --> 01:08:46,532
I keep their pictures in my wallet...

1277
01:08:49,573 --> 01:08:52,599
...to remind me that one person
can make a difference...

1278
01:08:52,776 --> 01:08:54,573
...even against insurmountable odds.

1279
01:08:56,213 --> 01:08:57,908
That's...
That's Pablo right there.

1280
01:08:58,081 --> 01:08:59,139
Ben.

1281
01:09:01,184 --> 01:09:06,121
If you had just spent half the amount
of time on your wedding vows...

1282
01:09:06,289 --> 01:09:09,690
...as this stupid little investigation...

1283
01:09:10,093 --> 01:09:13,028
...we would probably be walking
down the aisle tomorrow.

1284
01:09:13,196 --> 01:09:14,959
And, no, no...

1285
01:09:15,866 --> 01:09:17,731
I can't do it.

1286
01:09:23,907 --> 01:09:27,240
- Unbelievable.
- You're such a jerk.

1287
01:09:29,513 --> 01:09:30,639
Benjamin.

1288
01:09:32,416 --> 01:09:34,077
Are you happy now?

1289
01:09:35,018 --> 01:09:37,213
It's a painful process.

1290
01:09:37,387 --> 01:09:38,684
That's why we do it.

1291
01:09:38,855 --> 01:09:40,618
To find the truth, Benjamin.

1292
01:09:41,358 --> 01:09:42,382
Sometim...

1293
01:09:44,895 --> 01:09:48,262
Why did you punch the reverend?
What is wrong with you?

1294
01:09:49,533 --> 01:09:52,502
Nice right hook, but you are going to hell.
Know that?

1295
01:09:52,669 --> 01:09:54,694
I'm sorry. J.C., I'm sorry.

1296
01:09:57,474 --> 01:10:00,602
Three weeks.
That's a new course record.

1297
01:10:00,777 --> 01:10:04,440
Man, I haven't seen a right hook like that
since the Buffolini meltdown.

1298
01:10:04,614 --> 01:10:06,912
I hate this part.

1299
01:10:07,217 --> 01:10:09,481
I'll get the bag of frozen peas.
Come on.

1300
01:10:09,886 --> 01:10:11,376
Here we go.

1301
01:10:34,811 --> 01:10:36,210
Hi.

1302
01:10:37,647 --> 01:10:40,343
I can't believe I was about to marry
someone I didn't know.

1303
01:10:40,517 --> 01:10:42,644
That's why we have the course.

1304
01:10:42,819 --> 01:10:45,481
It's good that I found out now
instead of down the road...

1305
01:10:45,655 --> 01:10:48,055
...because that just
would have been awful.

1306
01:10:48,792 --> 01:10:51,283
I'm sorry, he just, he makes me so mad.

1307
01:10:51,928 --> 01:10:53,953
What am I supposed to do now?

1308
01:10:54,898 --> 01:10:57,093
- You still have your honeymoon tickets?
- Yeah.

1309
01:10:57,267 --> 01:10:58,359
Use them.

1310
01:10:58,535 --> 01:11:02,096
Go away for a couple of days.
Take a friend, family, anybody.

1311
01:11:03,039 --> 01:11:05,599
- I don't know.
- Oh, come on, it'll be great for you.

1312
01:11:06,243 --> 01:11:09,303
Get a tan, huh? Trust me.

1313
01:11:12,816 --> 01:11:14,613
See you, kiddo.

1314
01:11:15,986 --> 01:11:17,715
You know...

1315
01:11:18,221 --> 01:11:20,985
...maybe Ben wasn't the only...

1316
01:11:21,158 --> 01:11:22,182
No.

1317
01:11:22,359 --> 01:11:25,556
- No, no. What? What?
- No, have a great trip.

1318
01:11:32,536 --> 01:11:34,970
I mean, it wasn't supposed
to be like this.

1319
01:11:35,138 --> 01:11:37,436
Yeah, I feel as bad as you do.

1320
01:11:38,208 --> 01:11:41,405
Now she's using her honeymoon
ticket without me.

1321
01:11:41,711 --> 01:11:43,906
I mean, how is that supposed
to make me feel?

1322
01:11:44,814 --> 01:11:47,681
Bad. I think.

1323
01:11:49,219 --> 01:11:54,350
Three weeks ago, I was the happiest guy
in the world, and now I just...

1324
01:11:55,659 --> 01:11:57,286
Now I'm just sitting here with you.

1325
01:11:58,495 --> 01:12:01,692
Thanks.
Thanks, Ben. Appreciate that.

1326
01:12:01,865 --> 01:12:04,095
No, you know what I mean, I just...

1327
01:12:04,267 --> 01:12:05,700
Hey, it's cool.

1328
01:12:05,869 --> 01:12:10,897
Look, don't take this the wrong way,
because Sadie's cool, I like her a lot...

1329
01:12:11,074 --> 01:12:13,235
...but there are plenty of fish in the sea.

1330
01:12:13,410 --> 01:12:16,072
And now it's your time to be
the king barracuda...

1331
01:12:16,246 --> 01:12:19,010
...and get out there
and swim with the sweet tuna.

1332
01:12:19,182 --> 01:12:20,877
The ocean is yours, man.

1333
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:25,754
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

1334
01:12:27,390 --> 01:12:28,982
Okay.

1335
01:12:29,926 --> 01:12:31,450
You're a bear.

1336
01:12:31,628 --> 01:12:32,890
Now jump in that forest...

1337
01:12:33,063 --> 01:12:36,226
...and you gotta tag as many
cute, furry, bear butts as you can.

1338
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:37,559
Joel...

1339
01:12:37,734 --> 01:12:39,998
...you're my best friend, man.
You know that?

1340
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:43,471
- And I love you. You know that?
- I love you too.

1341
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:47,804
But you have got to be
the worst advice-giver I know.

1342
01:12:48,945 --> 01:12:51,971
I mean, not only is your
advice terrible, but...

1343
01:12:52,148 --> 01:12:55,174
...it just backfires at every turn.

1344
01:12:55,352 --> 01:12:58,879
And now you're talking to me
about fish and bears.

1345
01:12:59,055 --> 01:13:02,752
She's a woman, Joel.
I mean, she's an amazing woman.

1346
01:13:02,926 --> 01:13:05,224
And she's just so beautiful.

1347
01:13:05,395 --> 01:13:09,126
And she's loving and...

1348
01:13:09,366 --> 01:13:12,062
It was all right there...

1349
01:13:13,169 --> 01:13:15,034
...and I lost it.

1350
01:13:16,973 --> 01:13:21,171
And I don't need you telling me
that I should go out and find someone else.

1351
01:13:21,344 --> 01:13:25,144
I mean, I don't need anybody
telling me how to go...

1352
01:13:26,416 --> 01:13:28,680
I don't need anyone telling me.

1353
01:13:29,819 --> 01:13:31,480
Wait. Where you...
Ben! Hey!

1354
01:13:37,694 --> 01:13:39,855
No way.

1355
01:13:44,167 --> 01:13:46,829
Whoa! Is that one strike
or two against Rodriguez?

1356
01:13:47,003 --> 01:13:48,027
Two.

1357
01:13:48,204 --> 01:13:50,502
Awesome job with the camouflage, guys.

1358
01:13:50,674 --> 01:13:51,868
Seriously, you got me.

1359
01:13:52,042 --> 01:13:55,205
Who'd have thought you'd be in a van
with "Saint Augustine's"?

1360
01:13:55,445 --> 01:13:56,912
Just listening to the ball game!

1361
01:13:58,014 --> 01:13:59,845
Cubs are off today.

1362
01:14:15,932 --> 01:14:17,058
Hey, Gillie.

1363
01:14:17,233 --> 01:14:20,134
This guy say he's in love.
He come to Jamaica to find his girl.

1364
01:14:20,303 --> 01:14:23,761
Well, see, we were supposed to get married
and then she just called it off.

1365
01:14:25,175 --> 01:14:27,643
Oh, no. It's a long story. Just...

1366
01:14:27,811 --> 01:14:29,938
Man, you don't have to worry,
it's a long ride.

1367
01:14:30,113 --> 01:14:33,241
It's really a long ride.
You can sit and tell us.

1368
01:14:33,416 --> 01:14:34,906
Well, what happened was...

1369
01:14:37,087 --> 01:14:40,716
It is absolutely beautiful here.

1370
01:14:41,658 --> 01:14:44,354
Hey, Mom, you gonna get in your bikini?

1371
01:14:44,527 --> 01:14:45,516
Like hell I will.

1372
01:14:53,903 --> 01:14:56,667
Talk to her. This is for lovers, man!

1373
01:14:57,006 --> 01:14:58,098
Thank you.

1374
01:15:13,623 --> 01:15:14,988
It's Ben.

1375
01:15:20,296 --> 01:15:21,786
- What?
- Sadie, it's me.

1376
01:15:21,965 --> 01:15:24,763
- I know. What do you want?
- Look, I have to talk to you.

1377
01:15:24,934 --> 01:15:26,458
Guess what, Ben?

1378
01:15:26,636 --> 01:15:30,538
You had your chance. You had an empty
book and you didn't say anything.

1379
01:15:30,707 --> 01:15:33,676
- And that's part of the thing. Listen...
- No. Ben...

1380
01:15:33,843 --> 01:15:36,835
...I don't wanna talk to you.
- You don't understand. I'm in...

1381
01:15:37,013 --> 01:15:38,605
Sadie?

1382
01:15:39,082 --> 01:15:42,074
How come I could say so much
and he couldn't say anything to me?

1383
01:15:42,252 --> 01:15:44,311
Can someone please explain that?

1384
01:15:49,893 --> 01:15:51,258
Sorry.

1385
01:15:51,428 --> 01:15:53,328
I was just clearing my throat.

1386
01:15:53,496 --> 01:15:55,191
- John!
- What?

1387
01:15:55,365 --> 01:15:57,629
A piece of coconut went down
the wrong way.

1388
01:15:57,801 --> 01:15:59,428
Your daughter's in pain.

1389
01:15:59,602 --> 01:16:02,400
- Yes, I'm in pain. And I'm all alone too.
- Not you.

1390
01:16:02,572 --> 01:16:04,563
- I'm alone.
- Not you.

1391
01:16:04,741 --> 01:16:08,108
Is anyone at all concerned
with the fact that my life is falling apart?

1392
01:16:08,278 --> 01:16:10,906
Oh, of course we are, sweetie.

1393
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:13,742
But relationships are complicated.

1394
01:16:13,917 --> 01:16:18,251
- We certainly don't have all the answers.
- You guys have been married for 30 years.

1395
01:16:18,421 --> 01:16:22,551
- You must be doing something right.
- Not all those years were great.

1396
01:16:22,725 --> 01:16:27,287
Years 16 through 18 in our marriage were
something straight out of The Shining.

1397
01:16:28,231 --> 01:16:31,758
Okay, but Ben and I couldn't even decide on
what color napkins we wanted...

1398
01:16:31,935 --> 01:16:33,664
...let alone how many kids.

1399
01:16:33,837 --> 01:16:36,567
And he couldn't handle that
I have a good guy friend.

1400
01:16:36,739 --> 01:16:40,004
I don't know if it's our friendship
he was insecure about.

1401
01:16:40,176 --> 01:16:41,939
Really?

1402
01:16:42,545 --> 01:16:44,445
Listen, I'm gonna support you here.

1403
01:16:44,614 --> 01:16:47,777
But you gotta think about this
from Ben's perspective.

1404
01:16:47,951 --> 01:16:50,749
How do you think he feels when you're
always coming to me?

1405
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:53,718
- I don't go to you all the time.
- When are you going to him?

1406
01:16:54,858 --> 01:16:57,691
Just maybe...

1407
01:16:57,861 --> 01:17:00,694
...Ben wants to be with somebody
who needs him for a change.

1408
01:17:02,232 --> 01:17:03,790
That's really heartfelt.

1409
01:17:22,185 --> 01:17:24,415
- Does this happen all the time?
- Sadie?

1410
01:17:24,587 --> 01:17:27,385
To go from being so in love to this.

1411
01:17:27,557 --> 01:17:30,082
You know, I'm all alone
on my honeymoon at Sandals...

1412
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:34,128
...couples in love all over the place.
This isn't what I pictured.

1413
01:17:34,297 --> 01:17:36,731
Well, is it ever what you picture?

1414
01:17:37,534 --> 01:17:40,298
Were we the first ones to fail the course?

1415
01:17:40,470 --> 01:17:44,099
Who said the course is over?
It's only over when you decide it's done.

1416
01:17:44,307 --> 01:17:46,434
I don't know what to do.

1417
01:17:47,010 --> 01:17:48,409
It'll come to you.

1418
01:17:48,578 --> 01:17:50,102
Have faith.

1419
01:17:51,748 --> 01:17:54,080
Thank you, Reverend Frank.

1420
01:17:56,119 --> 01:17:57,279
Right on schedule.

1421
01:17:57,453 --> 01:18:00,616
Hallelujah. Now do you mind?
I need my beauty sleep.

1422
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:05,420
No smoking on this flight, but you
can light up whatever once we land.

1423
01:18:52,942 --> 01:18:54,773
- Ben?
- Hey.

1424
01:18:54,944 --> 01:18:56,912
You picked up.

1425
01:18:57,080 --> 01:19:00,072
It's so weird.
I was just thinking about you.

1426
01:19:00,249 --> 01:19:01,807
You were?

1427
01:19:01,985 --> 01:19:03,612
Yeah.

1428
01:19:04,354 --> 01:19:08,450
My family said some things
to me yesterday about...

1429
01:19:08,625 --> 01:19:12,026
...me not relying on you and...

1430
01:19:13,496 --> 01:19:15,964
...it got me thinking...

1431
01:19:16,132 --> 01:19:18,225
...about that stupid truck...

1432
01:19:18,401 --> 01:19:20,392
...you drew in your wedding
vow notebook.

1433
01:19:20,570 --> 01:19:24,062
And I know this is gonna
sound so weird but...

1434
01:19:27,877 --> 01:19:30,402
...it's why I love you.

1435
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:35,212
You don't always say the right things
or do the right things but somehow...

1436
01:19:36,185 --> 01:19:40,315
...I know you would jump through
a hoop of fire for me.

1437
01:19:41,324 --> 01:19:43,690
Hey, can you do me a favor?

1438
01:19:44,761 --> 01:19:48,925
I think you should come to your window.

1439
01:20:08,918 --> 01:20:11,478
I left my vow book at home so...

1440
01:20:11,654 --> 01:20:13,815
...I figured I should write
a few of them here.

1441
01:20:16,392 --> 01:20:17,484
What do you think?

1442
01:20:27,003 --> 01:20:29,062
- I am so sorry. I messed up.
- Me too.

1443
01:20:29,238 --> 01:20:31,399
There's so much to say.
I just didn't know how.

1444
01:20:31,574 --> 01:20:34,407
I need to stop doing everything myself
and share the reins.

1445
01:20:34,577 --> 01:20:36,977
No matter what I do,
I know you're gonna support me.

1446
01:20:37,146 --> 01:20:39,614
If I'm ever blindfolded,
you're the one to guide me.

1447
01:20:39,782 --> 01:20:42,148
I want to have as many kids
as we possibly can.

1448
01:20:42,318 --> 01:20:44,343
Really?
After Macy's, I definitely want two.

1449
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:46,044
I need to be more decisive.

1450
01:20:46,222 --> 01:20:48,656
- About napkins, about...
- Napkins, cheese, anything...

1451
01:20:48,825 --> 01:20:51,453
...at the end of the day,
I'm gonna rely on you.

1452
01:20:51,627 --> 01:20:54,721
Because nothing means
more to me than you.

1453
01:20:54,897 --> 01:20:57,798
Nothing. I love you.

1454
01:20:57,967 --> 01:20:59,832
I love you.

1455
01:21:07,543 --> 01:21:09,977
What's going on here?

1456
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:14,714
Reverend Frank?
What are you doing here?

1457
01:21:15,351 --> 01:21:17,819
Reverend Frank is
everywhere, remember?

1458
01:21:17,987 --> 01:21:19,921
Thought you two broke up.

1459
01:21:20,089 --> 01:21:23,490
We did. We just sort of talked it through.

1460
01:21:23,659 --> 01:21:26,822
Seems like we have more faith
in each other than we thought.

1461
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:28,285
Congratulations.

1462
01:21:28,464 --> 01:21:30,557
You just passed the course
with flying colors.

1463
01:21:31,868 --> 01:21:33,335
So how about it?

1464
01:21:33,503 --> 01:21:35,698
Do you think we should
get this wedding started?

1465
01:21:37,406 --> 01:21:38,532
I do.

1466
01:21:39,475 --> 01:21:42,137
And do you,
Benjamin Fitzpatrick Murphy...

1467
01:21:42,311 --> 01:21:47,408
...take Sadie Wilhelmina Jones
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

1468
01:21:47,583 --> 01:21:50,780
- I do.
- The rings.

1469
01:21:54,657 --> 01:21:56,716
"Never to fart"?

1470
01:21:56,893 --> 01:21:58,019
Oh, my God.

1471
01:21:58,194 --> 01:22:00,754
I didn't change it.
I'm gonna change it when I get back.

1472
01:22:00,930 --> 01:22:01,988
- I promise I will.
- No.

1473
01:22:02,165 --> 01:22:06,226
Bite your tongue, because I wouldn't want
it changed for anything in the whole world.

1474
01:22:06,402 --> 01:22:07,994
No.

1475
01:22:15,578 --> 01:22:17,102
Ready?

1476
01:22:19,081 --> 01:22:22,016
By the power vested in me by God...

1477
01:22:22,185 --> 01:22:27,213
...and the Minister of National Security
and Justice of Ocho Rios, Jamaica...

1478
01:22:27,390 --> 01:22:31,383
...I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1479
01:23:11,567 --> 01:23:14,092
You gotta turn. There it is!

1480
01:23:27,850 --> 01:23:30,546
Frank, we just wanted to come
and thank you for everything.

1481
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:33,245
- I'm just fulfilling my life's calling.
- You know what?

1482
01:23:33,422 --> 01:23:36,619
- We wouldn't have gotten here without you.
- Thanks.

1483
01:23:36,792 --> 01:23:39,317
You're gonna have a wonderful life.
I have no doubts.

1484
01:23:39,495 --> 01:23:43,261
Excuse me, may I borrow my daughter...
Your wife, for a dance?

1485
01:23:43,432 --> 01:23:45,127
- Yes, please.
- Thank you.

1486
01:23:45,301 --> 01:23:47,701
- Bye.
- You look beautiful.

1487
01:23:47,870 --> 01:23:49,394
Hey, can I ask you a question?

1488
01:23:49,572 --> 01:23:50,630
Sure.

1489
01:23:50,806 --> 01:23:53,331
When did you know that we were
ready to get married?

1490
01:23:53,509 --> 01:23:58,105
The moment you told Joel that Sadie wasn't
a fish, I knew it was meant to be.

1491
01:23:58,281 --> 01:24:01,444
Besides, anybody who kicks
a reverend's ass for his woman...

1492
01:24:01,617 --> 01:24:03,016
...you're A-okay in my book.

1493
01:24:03,185 --> 01:24:04,243
Well...

1494
01:24:05,021 --> 01:24:07,990
You're starting an incredible journey
with a wonderful partner.

1495
01:24:08,157 --> 01:24:09,317
Thank you.

1496
01:24:09,492 --> 01:24:12,984
And on the honeymoon, act surprised.

1497
01:24:13,162 --> 01:24:14,493
I will.

1498
01:24:14,664 --> 01:24:17,531
- Take care of yourself, B.
- You too, Frank.

1499
01:24:27,343 --> 01:24:29,334
Oh, my God.

1500
01:24:34,216 --> 01:24:36,912
- Wait.
- No, that's what they're supposed to do.

1501
01:24:37,086 --> 01:24:40,852
I know. I lost... We broke...

1502
01:24:41,023 --> 01:24:42,820
But it's okay if we laugh, right?

1503
01:24:42,992 --> 01:24:44,550
It's not okay if we laugh, is it?

1504
01:24:47,930 --> 01:24:50,023
- You broke!
- I did not.

1505
01:24:50,633 --> 01:24:52,726
We still got a siren. My ride's here.

1506
01:24:52,902 --> 01:24:56,201
I like shooting downtown L.A.,
because pretty much you got 911 all day.

1507
01:24:56,372 --> 01:24:57,361
I'll be over here.

1508
01:25:01,344 --> 01:25:05,337
Whoa!
"Be chill, don't kill."

1509
01:25:05,514 --> 01:25:08,483
That goes for you too, Mr. Simpson.
Okay.

1510
01:25:11,754 --> 01:25:13,346
I thought you'd work so hard!

1511
01:25:14,657 --> 01:25:17,922
Just get me a bottle of water
and a rubber mallet.

1512
01:25:23,699 --> 01:25:27,601
Come on.
Thrust it, thrust it, thrust it!

1513
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:32,908
People, we can do this.
They're not that...

1514
01:25:33,075 --> 01:25:34,804
Ben?

1515
01:25:38,581 --> 01:25:43,018
Help out, everybody.
Motherf* * * er.

1516
01:25:43,519 --> 01:25:45,783
You play cutch?

1517
01:25:45,955 --> 01:25:46,944
"Cutch."

1518
01:25:47,123 --> 01:25:50,581
Let me walk back and cutch,
which is a old game.

1519
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:52,921
That's scary that I could
say it like that...

1520
01:25:53,429 --> 01:25:55,124
Oh, my God.

1521
01:25:56,132 --> 01:25:57,997
No. Stop.

1522
01:26:01,237 --> 01:26:04,138
I'm gonna look like such a rookie,
because every time...

1523
01:26:04,974 --> 01:26:06,635
Cut.

1524
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:12,445
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
