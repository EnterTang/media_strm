1
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,150
Harry here super simple guitar.

2
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:13,090
I'm sweating up and playing this one cool say hopefully you know you don't.

3
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:18,780
You have great fun learning it because we have different licks.

4
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,030
There's also these

5
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:43,020
cool stuff you get to just play or play.

6
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:50,490
All right so one of the keys these cool lakes that even I have a hard time playing nice and clean.

7
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,510
Every time I play it great.

8
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,820
If you are you're my teacher but I have to do to quit playing runs VDU.

9
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:07,470
You'll be given a free for me Course and every teacher record would just play some guitar and clicking

10
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:12,840
a link to it all in close up.

11
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,760
All right so here are the close up.

12
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:23,350
So let me show you the intro first so when goal like this and take a middle finger put on the third

13
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:29,230
fret second string and then we're going to do is we're going to pick we're going to play the first and

14
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,540
second string at the same time.

15
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,610
Then I'm going to slide through

16
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:47,890
the lead with my ring finger I'm going to grab the fourth fret third straight in life from the forefront

17
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,510
of the second fret and do a pull off.

18
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,040
So altogether

19
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,720
I have to practice a little bit

20
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,400
OK.

21
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:11,340
And then E major and I want to hit the major hitting the whole Major again for the third first three

22
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,810
kind of bass strings three to four strings.

23
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,560
OK.

24
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,020
And then that's giving me space to do this kind of effect here.

25
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:28,680
So I hit the top strings and then I went down with the big and gently and went for the first two to

26
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,330
three strings down here.

27
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,110
OK.

28
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:31,600
So

29
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:41,540
I actually aim for the sixth string low and you could hit more strings just now and for the sixth one

30
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:51,880
then with these two fingers on this line for the Fourth and Fifth Third.

31
00:03:52,700 --> 00:04:01,620
So I let it slide.

32
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:02,510
Major

33
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,470
So

34
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:19,310
and again Major aiming for the top kind of bass strings.

35
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,050
Right.

36
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:20,980
OK.

37
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:27,150
So and when I'm sliding in here I'm holding down the fifth and the fourth straight.

38
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,380
OK.

39
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,540
I'm aiming for those two only those two I'm not trying to hit any other on but

40
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,450
the fourth and fifth string.

41
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:39,300
OK.

42
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:39,600
So

43
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:48,630
then I'm going to get up for those kind of bars here.

44
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:52,600
All right then comes the cool thing that you can do.

45
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,480
This is just one possibility to be showing you a few.

46
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:05,370
So I'm hitting the open fifth straight day Hameroff with my middle finger on its second fret.

47
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:16,560
I let him play the old hammer and that is two times

48
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:24,840
the third time I'm doing a hammer on him I'm staying here and that's leading me into my first quarter

49
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,650
which is the C major.

50
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:31,650
All right so I play the whole thing for you know just so you can get a feeling how it all fits into

51
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,090
place.

52
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,170
And then we're going to be learning some other stuff too.

53
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,690
There's probably got to be a two part video because there's just so much to cover.

54
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:39,060
So

55
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,860
that's leading us into a C major.

56
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,660
Now if you're good or you could just go

57
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,340
to the G

58
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,980
right.

59
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:22,940
Or if you kind of feel comfortable playing with a pick and hitting the right strings you could play

60
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,800
basically bass

61
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,870
so bass

62
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,060
then that little lake that I already showed you in the intro.

63
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:59,660
So that's kind of one possibility so.

64
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,110
All right.

65
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:08,010
So when you get to the D and other cool things you could do would be to hit the D with your pinky grab

66
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:15,300
the US for that for the bottom the strings and do a pull off with your pinky

67
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,770
hand so down

68
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,370
on play a little bit differently.

69
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,900
I played with the downstroke.

70
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:34,500
So sort of what you can do with you can do it.

71
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:39,530
So it's important to get downtown OK.

72
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,070
And not only hitting the bass and kind of getting a few more.

73
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,170
You don't worry about it too much if you only hit the bass if you get two or three strings.

74
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:50,660
OK.

75
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,200
Just see with your ear what sounds good to you.

76
00:07:53,430 --> 00:08:07,920
So what we did we played them we went to a and b.

77
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,620
All right.

78
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:17,680
OK so now let me show you another few cool things that you could do.

79
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:27,400
So let's do that as we're going to start with the CG and we're going to go down down.

80
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,170
The thing that I showed you.

81
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,540
So now it's a little trying to pull up with my pinky

82
00:08:46,590 --> 00:09:00,150
and now what I could do once I get to eat every time I get to that a set of goit what I can do is go.

83
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,260
So that's another little lick that I'm going to teach you now that I can make up and always use when

84
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:06,880
I play.

85
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:13,220
So let me teach you the Lick Lick goes like this.

86
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:21,080
All right so I'm hitting the open A hammered on down the second period and then I'm playing that opened

87
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:21,660
string

88
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:27,560
now with my fingers still on this.

89
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,880
Now I'm going to hit it again

90
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:38,150
with my ring finger or the sixth string third fret opening opening

91
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,900
play for you.

92
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,740
OK.

93
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,380
And you see those different things you can do.

94
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,440
Sometimes I go sometimes I go

95
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:08,030
sometimes I just kind of hit the notes.

96
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,610
I can't stop them from reading by putting the right hand.

97
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:15,070
So there's different things you can do experiment with them.

98
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:22,210
I'm just showing you different possibilities to try to inspire creativity within you when you play stuff.

99
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:26,560
All right so again on that you made the

100
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,390
link one more time.

101
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:42,720
I'm going on when I get back to this though a pole bending ever so slightly

102
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,000
rather than I'm going

103
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,950
and again on the 6 6 string the same thing

104
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,580
you don't want to overdo it but you want to get a little

105
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,530
a little bit in there if you can if you're a total beginner.

106
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:11,930
This will be hard for you.

107
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,380
So these are just different possibilities that you can do.

108
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,080
OK.

109
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,000
So that's not possible.

110
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,200
Number Twos are possible.

111
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,530
Number one when you get to that one

112
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,480
possibility number two is

113
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:41,790
that after that there's this like an hour to show you alteration to that would be to play here.

114
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,350
Let me show you that.

115
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:52,330
So now I'm on the first major and I'm bearing down on the fourth third and second string.

116
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,420
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to hit the No.

117
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:03,380
And a hammer from level nine I'm into it.

118
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,620
So it's Hammer.

119
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:07,940
So

120
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,070
hammer

121
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,080
that leads you back to the seat too.

122
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,400
So instead of going we're doing it here.

123
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:26,140
I do that pull up.

124
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,120
I'm actually aiming only for these two strings.

125
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,440
The second the third string in the fourth string.

126
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,610
I told you to hold in the second one.

127
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:36,160
Actually that one isn't as important we just need these two strings.

128
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,500
So the third string in the fourth string.

129
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:48,020
So if you hit the second string it's OK but the two are enough.

130
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,070
OK.

131
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:49,500
All right.

132
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,810
So let me show you endeavor Asian.

133
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,890
Let me just play through it one time and then I'm going to teach you this

134
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,780
kind of a little walking line.

135
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:04,270
All right.

136
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,210
So then play for us to go sing

137
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,900
and now the tricky part is hearing

138
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:40,490
it's really tricky to get because he fastened a little tip.

139
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:40,700
Are

140
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:56,780
with your ring finger only him for that one no time and the rest of the core by pleather of the court

141
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,310
after you got this done.

142
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,180
OK.

143
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,960
So that's kind of the trick here where the easier way is to go.

144
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,540
Hendrix did this.

145
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:12,910
He might have to play C and he might have looked back.

146
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,340
I'm actually not sure.

147
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:15,910
All right.

148
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,950
So let me you one other way that you could play that I did in the intro that I'm going to teach you

149
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,000
this this thing.

150
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,310
So here's one more way to go.

151
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,930
So Bass

152
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:37,800
what I'm doing is I'm playing hammering down and playing a bass

153
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:56,230
a bass and now I'm grabbing this kind of well a little like a small f shape and sliding to the G so

154
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:10,470
k so bass so small thing like the G.

155
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:20,250
And now what I would do is I'm going to slam down on the G with my pinky on the fifth string first fifth

156
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,290
first thing Fred.

157
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:30,730
So get in the car with a finger there cool off with lead paint you right after that.

158
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:39,320
So I came to practice that to build strength in the pinky.

159
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:51,370
Then as I take my ring finger slide to Fred and bear down on the third fourth and second third fourth

160
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:54,220
string so.

161
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,280
So that's

162
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,430
correct.

163
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,400
And that's actually D-CT.

164
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:11,110
I'm just playing a different bass on it.

165
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,970
It's kind of an inversion.

166
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:13,770
Don't worry about that.

167
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,700
So.

168
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:26,220
So once we slide from in here what we could do is take her pinky and hit lines.

169
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,140
So

170
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,470
and do to pull off fret third string

171
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:40,090
Garlett a pen.

172
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:42,760
So that is the same as this G shape.

173
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,050
And now we're going to hit it.

174
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:49,630
But now the some other thing you we're going to play the third string.

175
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,030
I've had some Halling

176
00:16:53,720 --> 00:17:03,930
that's leading me back to the now here you can do either you can do.

177
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,000
After that you can do

178
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:17,660
OK.

179
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:23,530
So these are just kind of tons of different possibilities that you can use to play through with this

180
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,220
crazy chord progression.

181
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,130
And Hendrix played it different every time too.

182
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,100
So it's a really great one to just experience it.

183
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,440
So last thing in this lesson is this.

184
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:39,130
We're going to hit the third fret fifth string after that.

185
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:43,460
All right.

186
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:48,720
So it's hard it's with the stuff man but I'm doing it.

187
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,370
So we're hitting the third for fifth string.

188
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,970
All.

189
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,130
OK.

190
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,530
So

191
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:06,130
in my first three I'm going down to of it straight.

192
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:20,250
So all right.

193
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:24,190
I don't know how to play this and talk through it at the same time it's really hard.

194
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:29,370
I'm just going to play it really slowly and you're going to have to kind of just watch and try and play

195
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:29,640
along.

196
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:29,910
So

197
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:37,130
in

198
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,750
the

199
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,030
so that's

200
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:04,050
I can't talk I'm sorry I can't listen.

201
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,860
User use you will get it.

202
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:19,740
All right.

203
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,310
That's it.

204
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:24,000
Tons of ways to play through this chord progression.

205
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:32,240
